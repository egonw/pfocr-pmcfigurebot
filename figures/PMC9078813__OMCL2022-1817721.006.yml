caption: Comparison of the major gene expression in energy metabolic pathways in astrocytes
  at 12 h and 24 h after MCAO. (a). Heatmap of GSVA results indicated major changes
  in the energy metabolism pathways. (b). Boxplots indicated the changes of expression
  of genes related to glycolysis. (c). Boxplots indicated the changes of expression
  of pentose phosphate pathway. (d). Boxplots indicated the changes of expression
  of the syntheses and transportation of lactate and glucose transporters.
