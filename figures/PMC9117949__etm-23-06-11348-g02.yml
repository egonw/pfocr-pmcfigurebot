caption: 'Effects of LEN on the apoptosis of H2O2-stimulated PC12 cells. (A and B)
  The apoptosis of H2O2-stimulated PC12 cells in the presence and absence of LEN at
  different doses, detected by TUNEL (magnification, x200). (C) Relative protein expression
  of apoptosis-related Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-9 in H2O2-stimulated
  PC12 cells in the presence and absence of LEN at different doses, detected by western
  blotting. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs. control; #P<0.05, ##P<0.01 and ###P<0.001
  vs. H2O2. LEN, lenalidomide.'

  Notch signaling pathway.
