caption: Single nuclei analysis identifies SCA1 disease associated transcriptional
  changes in Purkinje cells. For identified Purkinje Neurons, limma was used to test
  differential gene abundance between control and Pcp2-ATXN1[82Q] samples. N = 3 mice
  of each genotype. P values were adjusted using Benjamini-Hockberg method. Differential
  gene expression was determined by an adjusted p-values of 0.05. (A) Number of upregulated
  and downregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PCs. (B) Volcano plot
  showing DEGs of PC cluster in Pcp2-ATXN1[82Q] SCA1. (C) Heatplot displaying expression
  profiles of top 25 highest upregulated and downregulated PC DEGs in wild-type and
  Pcp2-ATXN1[82Q] samples determined by logFC values with adjusted p-values ≤0.05.
  N = 3 mice of each genotype. (D) Ridgeplot showing distribution of expression of
  selected genes in wild-type and Pcp2-ATXN1[82Q] Purkinje cells. (E) Dot plot of
  the differential expression of Magenta genes in Purkinje cells, Bergmann glia, velate
  astrocytes and oligodendrocytes with color of dot depicting expression and size
  of the dot depicting percentage of cells. All selected genes had adjusted p-value
  ≤ 0.05. (F) Pathway analysis of total DEGs between WT and Pcp2-ATXN1[82Q] PCs at
  12 weeks of age. The color of dots depicts the adjusted p values, radius of the
  dot depicts gene counts (number of genes in the enriched pathway).
