caption: An overview of the model structure and workflow. (A) The model consists of
  an input layer, a pathway layer, a hidden layer, and a softmax layer. The mRNA expression
  dataset and pathway information were assigned to the input nodes and binary mask
  matrix, respectively. (B) The pathway layer connects the relationship between pathways
  and genes. (C) The interpretability of PINNet was evaluated by comparing importance
  scores with known AD-related genes. In addition, we identified subnetworks of highly
  contributed genes and examined related biological processes through a functional
  enrichment test.
