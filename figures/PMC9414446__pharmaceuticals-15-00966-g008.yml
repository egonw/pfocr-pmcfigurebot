caption: (R)-SFN reduced the phosphorylation of the JAK2/STAT-3 pathway in LPS-activated
  peritoneal macrophages. Murine peritoneal macrophages were treated with ®-SFN (12.5
  and 6.25 µM) for 30 min, followed by LPS stimulation for 18 h. Histograms show the
  densitometric analysis of pJAK2 and pSTAT-3 proteins normalized to the β-actin housekeeping
  gene. Data are expressed as means ± SEMs (n = 6). (+++) p < 0.001 vs. unstimulated
  control cells; (***) p < 0.001 vs. LPS-DMSO-treated cells.
