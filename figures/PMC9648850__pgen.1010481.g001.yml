figure_title: Adhesion TCS pathway and adhesion profiling of lovKH180A::Tn mutants
caption: A) Schematic of the LovK-SpdSR-SkaH adhesion TCS system that regulates holdfast
  synthesis as described by Reyes-Ruiz et al. []. Question marks indicate postulated
  additional regulator(s) in the adhesion control pathway. Dashed lines indicate post-transcriptional
  regulation and solid lines indicate transcriptional regulation. Black arrows indicate
  activation and red bar-ended lines indicate repression. B) Genetic selection to
  identify insertions that disrupt the hyper-holdfast phenotype of lovKH180A. Tn-himar
  strains were cultivated and serially passaged for five days in the presence of cheesecloth
  (black cross-hatched lines in the center of the well). Mutants that do not permanently
  adhere to cheesecloth are increasingly enriched in the supernatant with each passage.
  Darker yellow color indicates non-adhesive lovKH180A::Tn strains that are enriched
  after five days of serial passaging. C) (left) List of the 25 genes for which transposon
  insertion has the largest disruptive effect on adhesion of the lovKH180A strain.
  (right) Enrichment in the supernatant is reflected in an increasing calculated fitness
  score with each daily passage. Mutations that disrupt lovKH180A adhesion to cheesecloth
  include the expected holdfast synthesis and modification genes (pink), and genes
  encoding the LovK-SpdSR-SkaH regulatory system (blue). The hypothetical gene CCNA_00551
  is listed in black; all remaining genes are colored grey.
