figure_title: The effect of 6-(methylsulfinyl) hexyl isothiocyanate (6-MSITC) on activation
  of AMPK, Nrf2, and FOXO1 as well as Sirtuin1 expression in control and combined
  fatty acids (CFA) medium
caption: HepG2 cells were treated with 6-MSITC (10 μM) in both control and CFA medium.
  Six hours culture was used to detect the expression of phosphorylation of AMP-activated
  protein kinase α (p-AMPKα), nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) like 2 (Nrf2),
  Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) (A). Twelve
  hours culture was used to detect the expression of p-Forkhead box protein O1 (p-FOXO1)
  (B), and 24 hours culture was used to detect the eapression of Sirtuin1 expression
  (C). The whole-cell lysates were used to detect the mentioned proteins by Western
  blot analysis with their respective antibodies. Densitometry of the blots was performed
  using the LumiVision Imager software. Histograms show the densitometric analysis
  of the mentioned proteins normalized to β-actin. The data were from triplicate tests.
