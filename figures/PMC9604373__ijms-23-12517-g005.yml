caption: Functional enrichment analysis of DEGs and enriched signaling pathways. (A)
  Transcriptomics flowchart. (B,C) Column chart and Venn diagram showing the number
  of DEGs up and down-regulated in the si-Ctrl versus si-THRB, si-THRB-DMSO versus
  si-THRB-MPA and si-THRB-DMSO versus si-THRB-NOMAC groups. (D) Heatmap of DEGs between
  si-Ctrl-RL95-2 and si-THRB-RL95-2 cells. (E) Heatmap of DEGs between DMSO and MPA
  treatments in THRB-silenced RL95-2 cells. (F) Heatmap of DEGs between DMSO and NOMAc
  treatments in THRB-silenced RL95-2 cells. (G) KEGG enrichment analysis of DEGs between
  si-Ctrl-RL95-2 and si-THRB-RL95-2 cells. (H) KEGG enrichment analysis of DEGs between
  si-THRB-DMSO-RL95-2 and si-THRB-MPA-RL95-2 cells. (I) KEGG enrichment analysis of
  DEGs between si-THRB-DMSO-RL95-2 and si-THRB-NOMAC-RL95-2 cells. The results are
  presented as mean ± SEM of three independent experiments. THRB, thyroid hormone
  receptor beta; si-Ctrl, negative control treated with siRNA solvent; si-THRB, silenced
  THRB; MPA, medroxyprogesterone acetate; NOMAc, nomegestrol acetate; DEGs, differentially
  expressed genes.
