caption: DEGs associated with light reactions (A). (B) Relative expression levels
  of DEGs in light reactions. (C) Relative expression levels of DEGs in Calvin cycle.
  (D–I) Relative expression levels of DEGs in energy metabolism and relative contents
  of DAMs. (J–L) Relative expression levels of DEGs in resistance metabolism and relative
  contents of DAMs. (M) Relative expression levels of DEGs in the growth rhythm system.
  The heatmap colored in blue and yellow indicates metabolite accumulation. The heatmap
  colored in green and brown indicates gene expression. CK, control group; DS, drought
  group; TP, normal externally applied tea polyphenol group; DS + TP, externally applied
  tea polyphenol group after drought.
