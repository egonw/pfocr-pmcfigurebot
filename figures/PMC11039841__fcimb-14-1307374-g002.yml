caption: Pathway to Clinical Implementation of Blue Light for Management of Skin Conditions.
  To determine the viability of blue light as a potential treatment option for skin
  conditions, firstly we need to decipher how blue light impacts microbial behaviour
  and in turn how theses microbes manipulate host responses to blue light utilising
  laboratory characterisation techniques (1). This will involve development of increasingly
  physiologically relevant models with the eventual use of ex vivo models and microbes
  derived directly from individuals. In parallel with this we also must ensure device
  design (2) is central to clinical application through thorough characterisation
  of light transmission through skin and patient centred design of photonics devices.
  This will involve a combination of photonics experts, biologists and engineers to
  reliably characterise a device convenient for everyday use. Ultimately, design of
  a device and application of irradiation of parameters will also rely upon personalised
  approach to medicine (3). For example, determining if there is a microbial imbalance
  in tissue and in turn anticipating whether the microbiome will elicit a favourable
  response to blue light, without elevating virulence and promoting host cell tissue
  apoptosis. We all must consider the dose dependent response where some individuals
  may experience a ‘sunburn’ response to blue light, whilst others may experience
  hyperpigmentation through elevated melanin expression. Such responses may be predicted
  through clinical consultation or perhaps development of AI platforms that automatically
  predict responses. Collectively this pathway will facilitate prediction of responses
  and suitability for clinical applications (image created using BioRender.com).
