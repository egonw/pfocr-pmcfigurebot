caption: 13C labeling of citrate after [5-13C]glutamine supplementation. (A) The 13C
  carbons of glutamine can label citrate at the C1 position (reductive metabolism)
  and at the C5 and C6 position (oxidative metabolism). (B) 13C NMR spectra of incubation
  medium of LNCaP cells (red) and of this medium spiked with citrate (green). The
  C1/5 and C6 resonances are indicated. (C) 1H-13C-HMBC heteronuclear correlation
  spectrum of the medium in B. Citrate resonances are indicated. The C6 resonances
  are resolved in the 2D spectrum from the overlapping resonance at 182.6 ppm. (D)
  1H-13C-HMBC of incubation medium of VCaP cells supplemented with [5-13C]glutamine
  and incubated for 48 h. Citrate resonances are indicated. The very low level of
  citrate C6 signal confirms that most glutamine carbons ending up in citrate follow
  the reductive carboxylation pathway.
