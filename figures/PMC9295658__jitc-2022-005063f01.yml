caption: Tumor cell-derived CCL2 is correlated with the polarization of TAMs, the
  trastuzumab resistance and the poor prognosis in HER2-positive GC patients. (A)
  The volcano plot was generated from mRNA sequencing analysis of HER2-negative and
  HER2-positive GC tissues. (B) Gene pathway analysis was performed and the candidate
  chemokine genes were shown. (C) IHC staining for CCL2 in GC tissues were shown.
  (D) The different IHC grades of CCL2 expression in HER2-negative and HER2-positive
  GC tissues was presented. (E) 33 HER2-positive patients were stratified into negative
  (−) and positive (+/++/+++) groups according to IHC staining for CCL2. Kaplan-Meier
  analysis of os in HER2-positive GC patients was performed based on CCL2 levels.
  (F) H&E staining and IHC staining for CCL2, CD68, CD86 and CD206 were shown to present
  the infiltrating TAMs in human HER2-positive GC tissues. (G–I) Pearson correlation
  analysis of IHC scores of CCL2 and CD68 (G), CCL2 and CD86 (H), as well as CCL2
  and CD206 (I). (J) The immunofluorescence double staining for CD68 and CD206 was
  shown in human HER2-positive GC tissues. (K–M) 33 HER2-positive patients were categorized
  into negative (−) and positive (+) groups, based on the median point of IHC score
  of CD68, CD86 or CD206. Survival analysis of CD68 (K), CD86 (L) and CD206 (M) was
  showed. (N) The distribution of the trastuzumab resistance in HER2-positive GC patients.
  (O–R) The different IHC scores of CD68 (O), CD86 (P), CD206 (Q), and CCL2 (R) between
  the trastuzumab-sensitive and trastuzumab-resistance tissues were presented. scale

  OS, overall survival.
