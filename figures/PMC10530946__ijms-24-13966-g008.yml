caption: 'Summary of the detected alterations occurring in the Trp degradation pathway
  at renal level. The metabolites included in the red border were upregulated, and
  those included in the green border were downregulated in Cfz-treated mice. The metabolites
  described only by their name were not affected by the drug. The box-plots represent
  the regulation of the metabolites in the samples: the pink represent the Cfz-treated
  mice and, the blue the Control mice.'
