  and invasion

  analysis based on TCGA data to predict the potential function and involved signaling
  pathway of ANXA2 by using R software. C The protein expressions of FAK, p-FAK, AKT,
  p-AKT, and ANXA2 in the empty vector group and LINC00941 overexpression group were
  measured by western blot analysis. D The protein expressions of FAK, p-FAK, AKT,
  p-AKT, and ANXA2 in the negative control group and LINC00941 knockdown group were
  measured by western blot analysis. E Western blot was used for analyzing the protein
  expressions of FAK, p-FAK, AKT, p-AKT, and ANXA2 in empty vecotr group, lv-LINC00941
  group, lv-LINC00941 combining PF-562271 (an inhibitor of FAK pathway) group and
  lv-LINC00941 + sh-ANXA2 group, respectively. F–I Colony-formation assay and transwell
  assay were performed to proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities in the
  empty vector group, lv-LINC00941 group, lv-LINC00941 + PF-562271 group and lv-LINC00941 + sh-ANXA2
  group. *, **, and ***, respectively, represent P < 0.05, P < 0.01, and P < 0.001.
