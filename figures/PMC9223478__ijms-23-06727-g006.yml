caption: Representative immunofluorescence staining of Npy. Representative immunofluorescence
  images (A) and relative green fluorescence intensity showing rate of Npy by immunofluorescence
  staining (B). Brain cells of mandarin fish were cultured in lysine-deprived medium
  alone or with 1 μM GCN2iB and 200 nM ISRIB treatments for 120 or 60 min, respectively.
  Npy (green), DAPI (blue) (scale bar = 100 μm). Results were expressed from at least
  three independent experiments. Labeled means without a common lowercase letter differ
  significantly (p < 0.05).
