caption: 5D3PC did not show acute or sub-acute toxicities. (A) Body weight of control
  and 5D3PC administered male and female mice. 5D3PC treatment has no major impact
  on body weights of acute study. (B) Photomicrography of liver, kidney, testis, and
  ovary of acute study. (×200, n = 2). (C) 5D3PC treatment has no major impact on
  body weights of sub-acute study. (D) Photomicrography of liver, kidney (E) testis,
  ovary in control and 5D3PC administration mice of acute and sub-acute study. (×200,
  n = 5). All results are expressed as mean ± SD.
