caption: 'Kub3 deletion impairs the differentiation of alveolar epithelial cells and
  the maturation of AECIIs. (A) Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the mRNA levels of
  marker genes for AECIs and AECIIs in E18.5 lungs. The data are derived from three
  independent experiments performed in triplicate and are normalized to the GAPDH
  (n = 3. *** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.01, * p < 0.05). (B) Immunoblot analysis of protein
  levels of AECI and AECII markers. GAPDH expression was used as a loading control.
  The ratios to GAPDH expression are represented by bar graphs (n = 3. *** p < 0.001,
  ** p < 0.01, * p < 0.05). (C) Immunostaining of Aqp5 and SP-C in lung sections between
  WT and KO at E18.5. The images on the right enlarged from box regions are in high
  magnification. Scale bar: 20 µm and 5 µm. (D) Periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) staining
  in the lung sections of E18.5 lungs. Scale bar: 20 µm. The statistical analysis
  of glycogen-rich cells among alveolar epithelial cells is presented by the bar graph;
  *** p < 0.001. (E) Transmission electron microscopic images of E18.5 lungs. Wild-type
  AECIIs contained numerous lamellar bodies (LBs) (arrows), but lamellar bodies were
  barely observed in KO lungs, and the cytoplasm was occupied by glycogen. Gly—glycogen
  deposit; Nu—nucleus. Scale bar: 10 µm in upper panel; 1 µm in bottom panel.'
