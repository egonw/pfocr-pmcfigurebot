caption: Knockdown of BCKDK reduces tumorigenic properties of HO8910-PM cells in vivo.
  (a) Mice and (b) tumors dissected from each group are shown. (c) Final average tumor
  growth curve and (d) tumor weight of mice injected with HO8910-PM-shMock or HO8910-PM-shBCKDK
  cells are shown. Data are shown as means ± standard deviation of measurements. The
  asterisk indicates a significant decrease in tumor size of HO8910-PM-shBCKDK-injected
  mice compared with HO8910-PM-shMock-injected mice (∗P < 0.05). (e) Immunohistochemistry
  analysis was performed in the tumor tissues of HO8910-PM-shMock-injected mice or
  HO8910-PM-shBCKDK-injected mice.
