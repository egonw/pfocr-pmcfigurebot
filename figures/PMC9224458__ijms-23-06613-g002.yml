caption: Wnt/β-catenin dependent signaling pathway and an example of associated miRNA
  (red) in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). (A) The binding of Wnt to its receptors
  Frizzled (FZDs) and to phosphorylated lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP)
  leads to activation of the Wnt signaling pathway. β-catenin is stabilized and translocated
  in the nucleus, where it binds to T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor-1 (TCF/LEF)
  to upregulate target genes. TGFβ1 synergizes with nuclear β-catenin regulating alfa-SMA
  expression. (B) In the absence of Wnt, β-catenin is degraded by the proteosome.
  Red color indicates upregulated miRNA, Stars represent byproducts of β-catenin degradation.
