caption: Analysis of apoptosis/necrosis of NB4 cells after exposure to different concentrations
  of realgar for 24 h. The cells were treated with different concentrations of realgar
  (0, 12.5, 25.0, 50.0 and 75.0 μg/ml) for 24 h, followed by staining with the Annexin
  V-FITC/PI apoptosis staining kit. Apoptosis/necrosis analysis was performed by flow
  cytometry. (A) (a) Untreated cells; (b) cells treated with 12.5 μg/ml of realgar;
  (c) cells treated with 25.0 μg/ml of realgar; (d) cells treated with 50.0 μg/ml
  of realgar; and (e) cells treated with 75.0 μg/ml of realgar. In addition, histogram
  analysis was performed on early apoptosis (B) and late apoptosis (C). Data were
  obtained from three independent experiments and are presented as the mean ± S.D.
  N = 3.
