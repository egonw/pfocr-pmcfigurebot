caption: Overview of the proteostasis network in eukaryotic cells. The maintenance
  of protein homeostasis centers around the turning of gears for multiple cellular
  processes that oversee the building or breakdown of new or damaged proteins. The
  four processes of folding, trafficking, synthesis, and degradation rely on pathway
  systems to maintain the proteome within the cell. For instance, the lysosome–autophagy
  and ubiquitin–proteasome pathways are central to degradation and recycling of damaged
  proteins which can accumulate in the cell. On the other hand, ribosome biogenesis
  aids in the translation and synthesis of new proteins required by the cell. With
  advancing age, disruption within the proteostasis network can lead to the development
  of diseases such as sarcopenia and Parkinson’s disease. Created with Biorender.com
