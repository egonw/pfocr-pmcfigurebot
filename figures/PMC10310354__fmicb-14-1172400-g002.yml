caption: Effects of Akkermansia muciniphila and its derived parts on ameliorating
  metabolic disorders. (1) A. muciniphila-derived protein P9 directly combined with
  ICAM-2 and activated the GLP-1 secretion in intestinal L cells, propionate was the
  metabolite of A. muciniphila and also activated the GLP-1, thereby enhancing insulin
  secretion and alleviating hyperglycemia. (2) A. muciniphila modulated the expression
  of genes involved in lipid metabolism, including PPARγ, PLIN2, UCP1, ApoE, LDL.
  (3) A. muciniphila facilitated the transportation of L-aspartate from gut to liver,
  L-aspartate upregulated the LKB1-AMPK pathway and ameliorated liver steatosis. (4)
  A. muciniphila decreased the level of βCDCA, which was one of the FXR inhibitors,
  thus increasing the intestinal FGF15/19 secretion. FGF15/19 acted on multiple tissues,
  improved hyperlipidemia and liver steatosis. Upward aspects are indicated in black,
  downward aspects are indicated in red. ICAM-2, intercellular adhesion molecule 2;
  GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide-1; FGF15/19, fibroblast growth factor 15/19; βCDCA,
  3β-chenodeoxycholic acid; FXR, farnesoid X receptor; L-asp., L-aspartate; LKB1,
  liver kinase B1; HDAC, histone deacetylases; UCP1, uncoupling protein 1; PLIN2,
  perilipin2; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma; LDL, low-density
  lipoprotein; ApoE, apolipoprotein E.
