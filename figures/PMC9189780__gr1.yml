caption: 'DNTTIP1 is highly expressed in NPC and associated with poor prognosis. (a)
  The FPKM (fragments per kilobase million) of DNTTIP1 in 3 pairs of normal nasopharyngeal
  epithelial tissues and nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues. * p < 0.05 using Student''s
  t-test. (b) The relative mRNA levels of DNTTIP1 were normalized to the GAPDH level
  in NPC tissue and normal nasopharyngeal epithelial tissue as determined by qRT-PCR.
  *** p < 0.001 using Student''s t-test. (c) Representative images showing high or
  low expression of DNTTIP1 in NPC tumor specimens. (left, scale bar: 100μm; right,
  scale bar: 50μm) (d-f) Kaplan-Meier overall, progression-free and distant metastasis-free
  survival curves were generated based on the protein level of DNTTIP1 in 96 paraffin-embedded
  NPC tissues. Data were compared using log-rank test. (g-h) Univariate and multivariable
  analyses were performed in the NPC cohort. Data were compared using Cox proportional
  hazards models.'
