caption: LRFN2 affects the Wnt/β‐catenin pathway and NF‐κB pathway through NMDAR to
  inhibit the malignant phenotype of ESCC. (A) The NMDAR antagonist's effects on the
  TE1 and KYSE30 proliferation. Through the plate cloning experiment, the inhibitory
  effect of LRFN2 on ESCC cell growth was weakened and the number of colonies increased
  compared with the pLVX‐LRFN2 group. (B) Effect of the NMDAR antagonist on the TE1
  and KYSE30 migration and invasion. The results showed that NMDA‐IN‐1 could promote
  the invasion and migration of ESCC cells in pLVX‐LRFN2 cells. (C) The scratch healing
  rate increased significantly in NMDA‐IN‐1‐treated pLVX‐LRFN2 cells. The results
  displayed that the scratch healing rate increased significantly in pLVX‐LRFN2 cells
  after treatment with NMDA‐IN‐1. (D) F‐actin fluorescence intensity of the control,
  pLVX‐LRFN2, and NMDA‐IN‐1‐treated groups. The F‐actin morphology of the overexpression
  group was rounder compared with the control group, indicating that cell activity
  decreased at this time. When NMDA‐IN‐1was added, F‐actin extended its tentacles,
  indicating that cell activity increased compared with the previous state. (E) After
  adding NMDA‐IN‐1, the expression levels of β‐catenin, c‐Myc, and cyclin D1 were
  higher compared with the control group. (F) LRFN2 recruits GRIN2B through PSD‐95
  on the cell membrane to form a complex and then enters the cell. In the cytoplasm,
  GRIN2B interacts with NF‐κB to block the NF‐κB pathway. In the nucleus, LRFN2 interacts
  with β‐catenin to block the WNT pathway. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.
