caption: MiR-182 inhibitor reversed the inhibitory effect of oe-ELF3 on adipogenic
  differentiation. A-G) The expression of ELF3, miR-182, TSHR and adipocytokines was
  determined by qPCR assay. The descriptive statistics were presented as mean ± SD.
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 H) PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in DM-induced
  3T3-L1 cells was ascertained by WB. I) ELISA assay was manipulated to detect TG
  content. J) Lipid droplet content was ascertained by Oil Red O staining. For each
  group at least three independent experiments were performed. The descriptive statistics
  were presented as mean ± SD. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
