caption: Pathway analysis, functional annotation of differentially expressed genes
  and identification of key regulatory genes of response to immunotherapy. (A) Barplot
  showing biological process terms and pathways of GSEA. GSEA-normalized enrichment
  scores are presented on the x-axis. (B) GSEA ridge plot for differentially expressed
  genes; the gradient indicates low to high adjusted p values. (C) Functional enrichment
  analysis from GSEA results. Nodes represent each enriched gene set of canonical
  pathways. Downregulated molecules are shown in shades of blue and upregulated genes
  are shown in shades of red. (D–G) Enrichment plots of top regulatory gene networks
  identified using gene set enrichment analysis. Significance was set at p-values
  (≤0.05) and false discovery rate (≤0.25). Enrichment plots show running enrichment
  score of the gene set as a running-sum statistic working down the ranked list of
  genes. Red–dashed line is the enrichment score peak of the plot for a specific gene
  set. Black–vertical bars are positions of genes in regulatory gene subnetworks in
  the ranked list of genes. Leading edge is a gene subset contributing mostly to enrichment
  scores and comprises the most differentially expressed genes.
