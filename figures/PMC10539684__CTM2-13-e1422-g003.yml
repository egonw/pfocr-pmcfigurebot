caption: FZD8 is a functional mediator of Ying Yang 1 (YY1) in regulating cell plasticity.
  (A) Five designed serial FZD8 promoter fragments for the luciferase assay. TSS,
  transcriptional start site. (B, C) Luciferase assays showed the different transcriptional
  activity of wt‐YY1 on the serial FZD8 promoter fragments, as indicated in LNCaP
  (B) and Du145 (C) cells. (D, E) In a Chromatin IP (ChIP) assay, wt‐YY1 binds to
  YY1‐specific binding sites at the FZD8 promoter. (D), the FZD8 promoter fragments
  (F1–10) in the precipitated DNA were amplified by PCR (E) with primers specific
  to these fragments. (F–H) Rescue experiments showing the effect of YY1 overexpression
  in LNCaP cells could be counteracted by FZD8 inhibition in colony formation assays
  (F), Transwell assays (G), and neurogenesis assays (H). (I, J) Western blotting
  (I) and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT qPCR) (J)
  analyses showed the level of epithelial‐mesenchymal transition (EMT) and neuroendocrine
  (NE) marker expression of YY1 overexpression in LNCaP cells could be counteracted
  by FZD8 inhibition. n.s, not significant, *p < .05, **p < .01, ***p < .001.
