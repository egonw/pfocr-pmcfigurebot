caption: Overexpression of Mettl3 upregulated the osteogenic ability of OP‐BMSCs in
  vivo. (A) Micro‐CT showed overexpression of Mettl3 increased the BV/TV, Tb.Th and
  Tb.N, whilst Tb.Sp was decreased in Mettl3(+) group after transplantation of OP‐BMSCs‐seeded
  BCP for 8 w. (B) H&E and Masson staining showed that the amount of fibrotic and
  mineralized new bone in Mettl3(+) group was more than that in CON, Mettl3(−) groups
  after transplantation of OP‐BMSCs‐seeded BCP for 8 w. (C) Semi‐quantitative analysis
  of H&E staining and Masson staining by utilizing ImageJ. Data represent the mean ± SD
  (n ≥ 3). (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001)
