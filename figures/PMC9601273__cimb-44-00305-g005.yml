caption: Regulation of angiogenesis via the Notch signaling pathway in CRC. Notch1
  is a single transmembrane protein located on the cell surface that interacts with
  Dll4 and Jagged1 expressed on adjacent cells. As a result, γ-secretase is activated
  to split Notch to induce NICD into the nucleus. Then, VEGFR3 and HES-1 are upregulated
  and are involved in subsequent angiogenesis in CRC. As inhibitors of the Notch pathway,
  ABL001, berberine, and quercetin are considered potential therapeutic agents to
  inhibit angiogenesis in CRC.
