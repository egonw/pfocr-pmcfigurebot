caption: 'AQP8 affects tumor growth in vivo in a nude mouse tumor model injected with
  three groups of cells: NC, O.E, and K.D. (A) Nude mice in each group. (B) Representative
  images of xenograft tumors derived from the four groups of U251 cells. (C) Growth
  curves of U251 cell-derived tumors. (D) Weights of U251 cell-derived tumors. Compared
  with the control group, the growth of tissues in O.E group was faster, but that
  in K.D group was slower (vs. control, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01). AQP, aquaporin; NC,
  negative control; O.E, overexpressed; K.D, knockdown. (n = 10; 4–6 weeks old.)'
article_title: AQP8 promotes glioma proliferation and growth, possibly through the
  ROS/PTEN/AKT signaling pathway.
