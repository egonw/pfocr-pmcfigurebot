caption: IBV Nsp14 inhibited chIFN-γ signaling and downstream gene expression. (A,B)
  HD11 or DF-1 cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3.1-Flag-Nsp14 (1 μg), pchGAS-luc
  (200 ng), and pRL-TK (10 ng). After 24 h, the cells were stimulated with chIFN-γ
  (100 ng/mL) for 6 h. Then, luminescence was detected using dual-luciferase reporter
  assays. (C,D) HD11 or DF-1 cells were co-transfected with increasing concentrations
  pcDNA3.1-Flag-Nsp14 (1 μg) and pcDNA3.1-Flag-Nsp14 (2 μg). After 24 h, the cells
  were stimulated with chIFN-γ (100 ng/mL) for 6 h. Luminescence was detected using
  dual-luciferase reporter assays. (E,F) Western blotting was used to detect the IBV
  Nsp14 protein level. (G,H) HD11 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-Flag-Nsp14
  (1 μg). After 24 h, the cells were stimulated with chIFN-γ (100 ng/mL) for 6 h.
  chGBP1 and chIRF8 mRNA levels were detected using the qRT-PCR assay. Data were presented
  as means ± SD. ** = p < 0.01, *** = p < 0.001.
