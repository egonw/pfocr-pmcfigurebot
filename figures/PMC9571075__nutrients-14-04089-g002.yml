caption: 'The possible role of chronic intake of fructose on lung injury through regulation
  of AR and mTORC1: (A) AR is an enzyme of the polyol pathway, that is involved in
  lung damage by promoting immune cell infiltration, inflammation, and fibrosis [,,].
  Fructose induces AR expression in several tissues [,,]. Chronic intake of fructose
  may regulate the activity of AR in the lung, inducing lung damage through the activation
  of the inflammation; (B) mTORC1 is involved in the development of lung damage; mTORC1
  induces extracellular matrix deposition and inflammation in lung epithelial cells
  [,,]; moreover, in PBMCs, mTORC1 induces corticoid resistance, which is a barrier
  to lung disease treatment []. Chronic intake of fructose activates mTORC1 in various
  tissues; thus, fructose may play a role in the development or exacerbation of lung
  damage. AR: aldose reductase; mTORC1: mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1. The
