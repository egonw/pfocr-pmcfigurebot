caption: 'The effects of PFOS on the expressions of mTOR and P70S6K. (A) Expression
  of phosphorylated mTOR and P70S6K in fixed liver tissues of male mice in the indicated
  groups. (B) Expression of phosphorylated mTOR and P70S6K in fixed liver tissues
  of female mice in the indicated groups. (C) Schematic diagram of a potential mechanism
  by which the fecal microbiota contributes to PFOS-induced liver injury. PFOS regulates
  the abundances of fecal microbiota, which in turn contribute to the regulation of
  arginine levels in livers and then result in the activation of mTOR-P70S6K signaling
  pathway that can cause liver injury. , The relative intensity represents the ratio
  between the expression level of phosphorylated protein (p-mTOR and p-P70S6K) and
  the total protein expression level (mTOR and P70S6K). Summary data can be found
  in Table S7. Statistical significance was analyzed by one-way ANOVA. Results were
  presented as the . Note: AKK, Akk. muciniphila; ANOVA, analysis of variance; EF,
  E. faecalis; LR, L. reuteri; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; P and PFOS, perfluorooctane
  sulfonate; SD, standard deviation. *. **. *** in comparison with the indicated group.'
