caption: 'Cleavage of APP by secretases. In the nonamyloidogenic pathway, the APP''s
  ectodomain is first released when α-secretase cleaves the protein within the Aβ
  sequence. When β-secretase cleaves APP at the amino terminus of the Aβ peptide and
  releases the APPs ectodomain, the amyloidogenic pathway is started.By digesting
  APP at two separate sites by γ-secretase, Aβ and p3 fragments of various lengths
  are created. Abbreviations: C83, carboxy-terminal fragment 83, 59, 99; Aβ, APP,
  APPsα, APPsβ ().'
