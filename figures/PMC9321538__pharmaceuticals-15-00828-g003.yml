caption: Changes in the expression of components of the AhR signaling pathway following
  differentiation of iPSCs into motor neurons (A,B) and in response to 24-h TCDD treatment
  (C–E) assessed by RT-qPCR. (A,B) Note significant higher mRNA expression of ARNT1
  and 2, CYP1B1 and AhRR in neurons as compared to iPSCs. (C) TCDD treatment increases
  CYP1A1 expression in neurons but not in iPSCs at all concentrations tested. (D)
  TCDD treatment increases CYP1B1 expression more in iPSCs than in neurons. (E) AhRR
  expression is downregulated by TCDD. n ≥ 3; * p < 0.05. NS indicates non-significant
  values.
