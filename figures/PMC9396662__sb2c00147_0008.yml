caption: 'Combining transgene cassettes to achieve predicted fluorescence levels within
  a three-gene pathway. (A) High (PCsVMV-5CsVMV:FP:3nos, H), medium (P35S:5TMVΩ:FP:3gctt3CPMVnos,
  M), and low (Pnos:5CMV1:FP:3gctt3CPMVnos, L) regulatory element cassettes (Table
  S2) were designed to control the expression of either GFP, BFP, or RFP reporters
  in all possible combinations. Combination 1 (Combo-1): H RFP, M GFP, and L BFP;
  combination 2 (Combo-2): H BFP, M GFP, and L RFP; combination 3 (Combo-3): H GFP,
  M BFP, and L RFP; combination 4 (Combo-4): H RFP, M BFP, and L GFP; combination
  5 (Combo-5): H BFP, M RFP, and L GFP; combination 6 (Combo-6): H GFP, M RFP, and
  L BFP. (B, C) Graphs represent scanning fluorometry and flow cytometry data obtained
  using intact leaf tissue and protoplasts isolated from the same tissue. Scanning
  fluorometry (excitation 475, 550, and 400 nm, emission 509, 574, and 455 nm) data
  is expressed as log10 of CPS (counts per second) values, while flow cytometry (excitation
  488, 561, and 405, emission 510/10, 585/16, and 440/50 bandpass filters) data is
  expressed as log10 of MEFL (molecules of equivalent fluorescein) values for GFP,
  RFP, and BFP respectively. Negative (plants transformed with untransformed Agrobacterium
  tumefaciens) and positive (plants transformed with the P2x35S:5TMVΩ:GFP:335S construct)
  controls are indicated with blue and red lines across the graphs, respectively.
  Data is represented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of at least three transformed
  plants per construct. The fluorescence levels of combinations 1–6 are compared with
  predicted single cassette fluorescence levels (light green, blue, and red). (D)
  Confocal images showing the same epidermal N. benthamiana leaf cells transformed
  with the indicated construct combinations, (Combo-1–6); reference combination 7
  (Combo-7): H GFP, H RFP, and H BFP; negative control 1 (NC1): H GFP only; negative
  control 2 (NC2): H BFP only; negative control 3 (NC3): H RFP only; and negative
  control 4 (NC4): leaves transformed with wild-type A. tumefaciens. Chlorophyll (Chl),
  bright-field (BF), and merged images are indicated. Scale bars = 50 μm.'
