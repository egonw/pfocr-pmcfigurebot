caption: Schematic presentation of the role of ACME in skin survival and colonization
  by S. aureus USA300. (a) S. aureus neutralizes the acidic pH of sweat by producing
  ammonia from L-arginine catabolism and thus colonizes the skin. (b) As the upper
  layers of the epidermis are broken down by bacteria, the inflammatory phase begins
  quickly. INOS-producing neutrophils and macrophages are presented at the site of
  infection. INOS produced by macrophages uses L-arginine to produce NO to kill bacteria
  and infection. In contrast, S. aureus counteracts this innate host attack by reregulating
  NO-induced lactate dehydrogenase (ldh1). (c) The infection then enters the postinflammatory
  phase. At this stage, the expression of Arg-1 by host macrophages leads to the synthesis
  of polyamine production. As mentioned, polyamines are essential for wound healing
  and inflammation, and most strains of S. aureus are sensitive to it, except for
  strains that have the ACME-encoded speG gene. In S. aureus, L-ornithine is produced
  by the L-arginine arc operon and is transported to the polyamine synthesis pathway,
  thereby highlighting the role of the speG gene in the organism's survival.
