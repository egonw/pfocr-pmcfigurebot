caption: 'Analysis of activation of caspases 8, 9, and 3 in free and HO-3867-treated
  U2OS and HOS cells. After experimental concentration range of HO-3867 treatment
  for 24 h, Western blot analysis was performed to measure expressions of caspases
  8, 9, and 3, and PARP as well as their active forms in (A,B) U2OS and (C,D) HOS
  cells. Then, quantitative analysis was assessed. n = 3. Caspase 8: U2OS: F = 4689.887,
  p < 0.001; HOS: F = 310.316, p < 0.001; caspase 9: U2OS: F = 1818.961, p < 0.001;
  HOS: F = 212.948, p < 0.001; caspase 3: U2OS: F = 7609.925, p < 0.001; HOS: F =
  1718.653, p < 0.001; PARP: U2OS: F = 406.910, p < 0.001; HOS: F = 528.206, p < 0.001.
  Cleaved caspase 8: U2OS: F = 326.549, p = 0.01; HOS: F = 689.730, p < 0.001; cleaved
  caspase 9: U2OS: F = 36.155, p < 0.001; HOS: F = 96.503, p < 0.001; cleaved caspase
  3: U2OS: F = 9138.156, p < 0.001; HOS: F = 10,315.365, p < 0.001; cleaved PARP:
  U2OS: F = 729.355, p < 0.001; HOS: F = 405.954, p < 0.001. a Significantly different,
  p < 0.05, when compared to control. b Significantly different, p < 0.05, when compared
  to 2 μM. c Significantly different, p < 0.05, when compared to 4 μM. d Significantly
  different, p < 0.05, when compared to 8 μM.'
