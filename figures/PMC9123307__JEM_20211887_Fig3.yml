caption: 'Human neurons build synapses and alter transcriptional programs in response
  to IL-4. (A) Immunocytochemistry for Syn1 (green), Homer-1 (magenta), MAP2 (red),
  and Dapi (blue), showing human neurons build synapses (arrows) at 35 d in vitro.
  Scale bar = 25 µm. (B) Patched human neurons displaying spontaneous electrical activity.
  (C) RNAseq on human neurons treated for 7 d with IL-4 (n = 4) or PBS (n = 3): Volcano
  plot of differentially regulated genes. (D) GO term for positive regulation of neuron
  projection (GO: 0010976) showing, among others, signaling molecules (arrows). (E)
  KEGG pathway analysis showing regulation of relevant synaptic pathways (arrows).
  (F) RT-qPCR on murine IL-4–treated neurons. Representative quantifications of two
  independent experiments (PBS, n = 3; IL-4, n = 6); mean ± SEM. Statistics (F): Bayesian
  analysis, accuracy, * >80% (see ).'
