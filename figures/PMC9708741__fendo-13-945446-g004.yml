caption: Transcriptome sequencing results. (A) shows the heat map of the three groups
  including the negative control, high glucose group, and high glucose treated with
  safranal group. (B, C) demonstrate the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
  and Gene Ontology (GO) results between the high glucose group and high glucose treated
  with safranal group. From the bubble graph, the MAPK signaling pathway demostrateda
  high gene ratio (D) and the detailed pathway was demonstrated in (E).
