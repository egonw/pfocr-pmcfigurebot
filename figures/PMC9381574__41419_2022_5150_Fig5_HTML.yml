figure_title: FOXA1 prevented metabolic stress-induced autophagic cell death via activation
  of IGF2/IGF1R/mTORC1 signaling
caption: A, B Status of the IGF1R/AKT/mTORC1 signaling pathway upon loss or gain of
  expression of FOXA in LUAD cells cultured in complete medium or PBS as evaluated
  by western blot assays. C Exogenous IGF2 expression levels in A549 cells as determined
  by RT-PCR or western blot assays. Mean ± SD, n = 3. D Survival of A549 cells with
  or without IGF2 forced expression as measured using colony formation assays. Mean ± SD,
  n = 3. E Survival of PC-9 cells in nutrients deprived conditions upon treatment
  with linsitinib (0.5 μM), anti-IGF2 antibodies (0.5 μg/mL), anti-VEGF antibodies
  (0.5 μg/mL), or rapamycin (50 nM) were determined using colony formation assays.
  Mean ± SD, n = 3. F Colony formation assays demonstrated that supplementation with
  recombinant IGF2 restored survival in FOXA1-deficient PC-9 cells under metabolic
  stress conditions. Mean ± SD, n = 3. G Colony formation assays demonstrated that
  stable expression of IGF2 restored survival in FOXA1-deficient PC-9 cells under
  metabolic stress conditions. Mean ± SD, n = 3. H Colony formation assays indicated
  that treatment with IGF2 antibody (0.5 μg/mL), VEGF antibody (0.5 μg/mL), linsitinib
  (0.5 μM) or rapamycin (50 nM) abolished the protective effects of FOXA1 expression
  on A549 cells in nutrients deprived conditions. Mean ± SD, n = 3. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01;
  ***P < 0.001, NS not significant.
