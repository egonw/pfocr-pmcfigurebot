caption: ICA and ICA derivatives regulate PI3K/AKT, Wnt/β-catenin and TGF-β/Smad signaling
  pathways to regulate stem cell biological behavior. ICA and ICA derivatives promote
  p-AKT expression, which in turn promotes downstream eNOS/NO expression, activate
  mTORC1/p70S6K/4EBP1 to promote cell proliferation, inhibits Bcl-2 and GSK3 expression
  to inhibit apoptosis, and inhibits transcription factor CREB expression. ICA and
  ICA derivatives regulate the TGF-β/Smad and p38 MAPK pathways mainly by inhibiting
  Smad2/3 and p38 MAPK phosphorylation, while regulation of the Wnt pathway may be
  achieved by increasing frizzled class receptor expression and β-catenin phosphorylation.
  The regulation of these pathways by ICA and ICA derivatives ultimately leads to
  increased proliferation and differentiation of stem cells and inhibition of apoptosis
  and fibrosis. ICA, icariin; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinases; Akt, threonine-specific
