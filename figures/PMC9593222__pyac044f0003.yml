caption: Synapse-related and neuron-related biological process (BP) results and core
  analysis based on RNA-sequencing data. (A) The network was constructed with neuron-related
  BP terms based on 563 upregulated genes (P < .05, q < 0.05, and >1.3-fold change),
  which were more abundant than 400 downregulated genes (P < .05, q < 0.05, and >1.3-fold
  change) using ClueGo in the Cytoscape program. Canonical pathways, disease, and
  function were analyzed using 563 upregulated and 400 downregulated genes (P < .05,
  q < 0.05, and >1.3-fold change). Significant results for the canonical pathway (B)
  and disease and function (C) are shown in red (up) and blue (down) circles. Spot/circle
  size is the function of –log(base = 10) of Fisher’s exact test enrichment P value.
