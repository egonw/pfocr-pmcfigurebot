caption: Schematic of experimental workflow.In this study, we evaluated the expression
  profile of m6A-related proteins in LUAD to uncover potential biomaterial-associated
  targets. IGF2BP3 was identified as a significant potential target by analyzing publicly
  available GEO data. Subsequently, targets of IGF2BP3 were extracted by analyzing
  publicly available eCLIP-seq, RNA-seq, and m6A-seq data. The 1925 IGF2BP3 mRNA targets
  were further evaluated through GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. The results
  demonstrate that IGF2BP3 might be associated with ferroptosis. Further experiments
  were performed to verify that IGF2BP3 is a key potential target for the development
  of a therapeutic drug to induce ferroptosis and treat LUAD. Finally, rigosertib
  was identified as a potent anti-tumor small molecule that exerts its role via reducing
  IGF2BP3 expression.
