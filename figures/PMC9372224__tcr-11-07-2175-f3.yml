caption: CAY10526 inhibited the JAK/STAT, TGF-β/Smad3 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway
  in Hut78 cells. (A) Western blot showing CAY10526 inhibited the expression of JAK1,
  JAK2 and pSTAT3 in Hut78 cells. (B) The expression of PI3Kp110, PI3Kp85 and p-AKT
  protein declined as the increased concentration of CAY10526. (C) CAY10526 inhibited
  the expression of p-Smad3. (D) The expression of CyclinD1 decreased after exposure
  to CAY10526 with indicated concentrations. Each protein band intensity was quantified
  by ImageJ software (mean ± SD, n=3), normalized to loading control GAPDH and compared
  to the levels of control (0 µM). *, P<0.05 versus control. GAPDH, glyceraldehyde
  phosphate dehydrogenase; JAK/STAT, Janus kinase/signal transduction and transcription;
  TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; PI3K/AKT, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein
  kinase B.
