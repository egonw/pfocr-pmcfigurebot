caption: circCNN2 upregulates E2F1 expression via miR-184. (a) RT-qPCR was used to
  examine the expression of 8 candidate mRNAs (H2AFX, LSM4, ARHGAP39, CLUH, MDH2,
  E2F1, CDCA4, and TIMM13) upon circCNN2 knockdown. (b, c) RT-qPCR and western blot
  assays were conducted to test the expression and protein levels of E2F1 upon circCNN2
  knockdown in H1703 and H226 cells. (d) RT-qPCR and western blot analysis were used
  to examine the expression and protein levels of E2F1 in LUSC cells. (e) RT-qPCR
  and western blot assays were conducted to detect the expression and protein levels
  of E2F1 upon miR-184 downregulation. (f) RNA pull down assay was carried out to
  verify the binding ability between miR-184 and E2F1 with Bio-NC as the control.
  (g) The binding ability between miR-184 and E2F1 was verified through luciferase
  report assay by testing the luciferase activity of LUSC cells transfected with wild-type
  or mutated E2F1 plasmids upon mimics NC and miR-184 mimics. (h) Rescue assays were
  conducted to verify the interaction among circCNN2, miR-184 and E2F1. ∗∗P < 0.01
  compared to the control group.
