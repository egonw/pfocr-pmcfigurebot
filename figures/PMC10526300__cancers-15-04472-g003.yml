caption: Drug combination induced UPR pathway among all related genes by qRT-PCR.
  (A–C) Increased expression of UPR-related genes such as Bip, Chop, and Xbp1 caused
  the accumulation of unfolded proteins and ER stress, leading to apoptosis in the
  Ramos and Daudi cell lines. UPR occurred more significantly in the Daudi cell lines.
  **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001; as determined by two-tailed, unpaired t-tests. Error
  bars are shown as mean ± SD.
