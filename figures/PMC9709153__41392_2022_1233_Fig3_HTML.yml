caption: PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The PI3K/Akt pathway is mainly activated by an
  array of growth factors, such as IGF-1, NRG1, VEGF, and BDNF. Akt can be directly
  activated by Notch signaling. The PI3K/Akt pathway mainly acts as the upstream of
  mTOR activation. The activation of mTOR promotes cardiomyogenesis, myogenesis, and
  neurogenesis via various signaling. Importantly, PI3K/Akt axis inhibits C/EBPÎ²,
  thus upregulating CITED4 to activate mTOR and promoting myogenesis. Additionally,
  the PI3K/Akt axis inhibits FOXOs, promoting myogenesis. eNOS is upregulated by the
  PI3K/Akt axis, promoting angiogenesis. Created with BioRender
