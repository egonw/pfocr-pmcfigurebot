caption: Transcriptome analysis on CPP-treated HDFs and DMSO-treated HDFs via RNA
  sequencing. HDFs were CPP treated for 6 days, RNA-seq was conducted to detect the
  gene expression. (a) Differential gene volcano map. The abscissa is the log2FoldChange
  value, the ordinate is -log10padj or -log10pvalue, and the blue dotted line represents
  the threshold line of the differential gene screening criteria. (b) Heatmap representing
  EC-related genes. Expression values relative to the average expression values across
  all samples are represented by colors from green to red (log2 scale). (c) Differential
  genes related to endothelial cells in CPP-induced HDFs obtained by RNA-seq.
