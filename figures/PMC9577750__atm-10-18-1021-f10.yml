caption: Analysis of the tumor immune microenvironment. (A) The differences in stromal
  score, immune score, and ESTIMATE score between the high group and low group. (B)
  The differences in scores of 10 kinds of immune cells between the high group and
  low group. (C) The expression levels of immune checkpoint genes between the high
  group and low group. (D) The differences in scores of 28 kinds of immune cells between
  the high group and low group. (E-G) Score differences of the Toll-like receptor
  signaling pathway, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, and antigen processing
  and presentation between the high group and low group. (H) CYT score differences
  between the high group and low group. *P<0.05; **P<0.01; ***P<0.001; ****P<0.0001.
  ns, no significance; ESTIMATE, Estimation of Stromal and Immune cells in Malignant
  Tumors using Expression data; CYT, cytolytic activity; NK, natural killer.
