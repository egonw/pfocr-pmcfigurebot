figure_title: Early larval caste differentiation in ants
caption: a, Tissue-specific relative expression levels for the conserved caste-biased
  DEGs in early larvae, shown separately for gyne-biased (rows marked in red) and
  worker-biased (blue) genes. Heatmap brightness of cells reflects tissue specificity,
  the percentage of transcripts from targeted tissues (columns), ranging from 0% (black)
  to 100% (yellow). These relative abundances, based on the larval gene expression
  atlas of Drosophila, show that the gyne-biased DEGs in the early larval stages were
  mainly expressed in the midgut, fat body, and tracheal tissues, while the worker-biased
  DEGs were mainly expressed in the brain and central nervous system. b, Expression
  profiles of circadian clock-controlled protein (daywake), juvenile hormone acid
  O-methyltransferase-like (jhamt-like) and hexamerin among gynes and workers of the
  two ant species as larvae grow. All three genes are associated with the juvenile
  hormone signalling pathway and are significantly differentially expressed between
  castes in 2nd and 3rd instar larvae. Expression profiles are plotted against body
  length (log scale) to show expression dynamics as larvae grow in body length. c,
  DAPI staining of a representative early 3rd instar worker larva and a representative
  2nd instar gyne larva of M. pharaonis. These animals display similar body size but
  wing discs (arrows) were only visible in the gyne larvae, indicating that caste
  determination and differentiation has already been initiated well before this early
  larval stage.
