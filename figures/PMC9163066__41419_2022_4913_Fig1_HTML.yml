figure_title: The validation and characterization of circSCAF8 in PCa
caption: A The Spearman correlation analysis of circSCAF8 level between the tumor
  tissue and matched urine extracellular vesicles in 30 PCa patients. B Schematic
  illustration showing circSCAF8 derived from exons 2 to 12 of SCAF8. C Rolling circle
  reverse transcription and Sanger sequencing were used to confirm the full length
  of circSCAF8 in PC3 cells. The arrow indicated the special back splicing junction
  site of circSCAF8. D Divergent and convergent primers were used to detect circular
  RNAs in cDNA and gDNA, divergent primers can detect the existence of circular RNAs
  in cDNA but not in gDNA. GAPDH was used as a control for a linear RNA transcript.
  E, F The abundances of circSCAF8 and SCAF8 mRNA were determined by PCR and qRT-PCR
  after treatment with RNase R in PC3 and 22RV1 cells. G, H Cytoplasmic-nuclear fractionation
  assay and FISH showed that circSCAF8 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm of PC3
  and 22RV1 cells. GAPDH and U6 were used as cytoplasm control and nuclear control,
  respectively. Error bars represent the standard deviation (SD) of three independent
  experiments. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. PCa prostate cancer, FISH fluorescence
  in situ hybridization.
