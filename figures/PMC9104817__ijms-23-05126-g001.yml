caption: CD73 and Ado production by NSCLC cells. Images show NSCLC cell lines grown
  as adherent cells (A) and as as spheres, when cultured in the specific serum-free
  medium (B). (C) The subset of stem cells expressing CD133/CXCR4 was also highly
  positive for CD73, with a significantly increased expression for H3122s and A549s
  compared to the adherent counterparts, p < 0.05. (D) Western blot analysis confirmed
  the up-regulation of CD73 in NSCLC spheres compared to the adherent counterpart
  and showed the expression of the different Ado P1 purinergic receptors. Quantification
  of each band is reported (E). The graph reports the level of expression CD38, PC1,
  and CD26, which were basically up-regulated in NSCLC spheres compared to the adherent
  cells; data are the mean value ± SD of three analyses for each cell line. (F) Bars
  indicate the quantification of Ado production, as mean area % of the peaks ± SD,
  showing a significantly increased Ado production by H3122 and A549 spheres, p <
  0.05. Student’s t-test was performed to compare adherent cells and spheres.
