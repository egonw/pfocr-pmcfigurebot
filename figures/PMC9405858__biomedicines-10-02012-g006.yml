caption: PHA-767491 potently inhibits proliferation in Rb+ prostate and colorectal
  cancer cell lines. (A) Prostate carcinoma cell line PC3 was treated with 10 μM XL-413,
  10 μM PHA-767491, 10 μM CVT or 30μM CVT roscovitine or for 24 h as indicated. Cells
  were pulse labelled with EdU showing each cell cycle phase shown for each treatment.
  (B) As for A, except using SW620 cells. (C) As for A, except using SW480. (D) Cumulative
  bar charts showing percentage of G1 (blue), S phase (red) and G2/M phase (green)
  cells from A. Error bars represent three biological replicas totalling nine technical
  repeats expressed as standard deviation. (E) As for (D), but of B. (F) Like D, but
  of C. (G) Dose dependence curves for IC50 calculation for PHA-767491 and XL-413
  for PC3 cells, where n = 9 showing mean ± standard deviation. (H) As for H using
  SW480 cells. (I) As for H using SW620 cells.
