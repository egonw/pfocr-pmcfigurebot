figure_title: Assessment of TAFA4-activated signal pathway in DCs
caption: 'Mice were treated with TAFA4-containing nasal instillation daily for one
  week. DCs were isolated from the airway tissues, and analyzed by RNAseq and Western
  blotting. a 20 most enriched signaling pathways in DCs. b GO analysis results show
  DEGs and signaling pathway mapping. câ€“e Immunoblots show protein levels of FPR1,
  MyD88 and AKT, in DCs. f Boxplots show the levels of c-Maf in the Il10 promoter
  in DCs. Statistics: Two-tail Student-t test. The data represent six independent
  experiments. The data of boxplot are presented as median (middle line inside box),
  75% value (upper bound of box), 25% value (lower bound of box), max (upper whisker),
  and min (lower whisker). Each dot in boxplot presents data obtained from one sample.'
