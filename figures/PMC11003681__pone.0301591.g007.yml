caption: Heatplots of the Reactome enriched pathways for the (A) COAD, (B) BRCA. The
  plots were generated using the differential nodes in GAIN-Chr20 group located in
  the mRNA-expression layer. The y-axis reports the significant enriched pathways.
  The x-axis indicates the genes contributing to the pathway. In gray are indicated
  the genes with logFC = 0. The color key represents a spectrum of lowest gene expression
  (blue) to highest gene expression (red). In order to reduce the color scale, we
  setted a logFC range between 2 and -2.
