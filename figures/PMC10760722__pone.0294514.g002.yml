figure_title: CTSB overexpression promotes plaque formation and CTSB gene silencing
  alleviates plaque formation in ApoE-/- mice
caption: '(A) Representative images of Oil Red O staining of aortas (scale bar: 3
  mm). (B) HE staining (upper) and Masson’s staining (lower) of aortic roots (scale
  bar: 500 μm). The black box indicates the magnified area shown below each image
  (scale bar: 200 μm). The black arrows show collagen-positive areas. (C) Representative
  western blots of CTSB and pyroptosis indicators (NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1 p10 [active
  caspase-1 subunit], GSDMD-N) in aorta. (D) Quantitative analyses of Oil Red O-positive
  area in whole aorta. (E) Quantitative analyses of lesion size in aortic roots. (F)
  Quantitative analyses of collagen area in plaque. (G) LDL-C level. (H–K) Quantification
  analysis of protein levels in aorta: (H) CTSB, (I) NLRP3, (J) caspase-1 p10, and
  (K) GSDMD-N. Data are presented as means ± SEM. n = 3, *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001,
  and ****P<0.0001. NC: mice fed chow diet; CTRL: mice fed a high-fat diet; Mock:
  empty lentiviral vector + high-fat diet; sh-CTSB: CTSB shRNA + high-fat diet; Lv-CTSB:
  CTSB lentivirus + high-fat diet; CTSB: cathepsin B; HE: hematoxylin and eosin; NLRP3:
  NOD-like receptor protein 3; GSDMD-N: N-terminal gasdermin D; LDL-C: low-density
  lipoprotein cholesterol.'
article_title: Cathepsin B aggravates atherosclerosis in ApoE-deficient mice by modulating
  vascular smooth muscle cell pyroptosis through NF-κB / NLRP3 signaling pathway.
