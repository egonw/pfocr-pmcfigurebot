caption: Lactucin and equivalent volume of vehicle (DMSO) exposure (24 h) induced
  cell cycle inhibition of lung adenocarcinoma A549 (80 μM), and H2347 (70 μM) cells
  (A) were measured by flow cytometry. WB analysis of cyclin B1, cyclin D1, CDK2,
  CDK4, p21, and p27 protein expression in A549 and H2347 cells after exposure to
  Lactucin at 0, 20, 40, and 80 μM for 24 h (B). Lactucin significantly downregulates
  Cyclin B1 and Cyclin D1 (C), CDK4, and CDK2 (D) and downregulates the p21 and p53
  (E) expression in both A549 and H2347 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Data are
  expressed as the means ± standard deviation of triplicate experiments. * p < 0.05,
  ** p< 0.01, *** p < 0.001, and **** p < 0.0001 were considered significant.
