caption: IVM alone or in combination with anticancer drug inhibited the migration
  of cancer cells in vitro. Breast cancer MCF-7 cells (A) and MDA-MB-231 cells (B),
  and colorectal cancer HCT-8 cells (C) and HCT-116 cells (D) were treated with IVM
  in the presence or absence of the anticancer drug adriamycin (ADR) (A and B) or
  vincristine (VCR) (C and D). Wound healing assay was performed at 0 and 24 h, respectively,
  after the treatment of IVM alone or in combination with ADR or VCR. Quantitation
  of wound closure was performed as described in . Scale bar = 250 μm. Cells treated
  with vehicle served as control. Data in the histograms were presented as the mean
  ± SD (n = 3). **P < 0.01, compared with their respective controls.
