caption: Bulk metabolomic analysis of TAMCs from CT-2A-bearing brains of C57 mice
  received radiotherapy (RT) or RT + B-LNP/diABZI combination therapy (referred to
  as Combo). Unbiased metabolomics (a) and metabolic pathway analysis (b) of TAMCs
  from brain tumors. c Schematic illustration of the arginine metabolic pathway. LC-MS/MS
  analysis of iNOS (d), ARG1 (e), and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) (f)-derived metabolites
  in TAMCs. n = 3 samples (TAMCs collected from 5 CT-2A-bearing mice were pooled for
  each sample; in total, 15 mice per treatment group). Statistics were determined
  by two-sided Student’s t-test. The data are presented as mean + /- SEM. Source data
  are provided as a Source Data file.
