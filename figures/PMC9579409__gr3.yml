caption: Gene modulation associated with significant Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
  Genomes (KEGG) pathways at different timepoints. (A) Gene modulation was determined
  based on gene expression values in the “cell cycle pathway” enriched specifically
  in C1. (B) Gene modulation in the “Wnt signaling pathway” enriched in C2. (C, D)
  Gene modulation in the “fatty acid biosynthesis” and “phenylalanine, tyrosine, and
  tryptophan biosynthesis” pathways enriched in C3.
