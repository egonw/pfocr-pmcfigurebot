caption: Effect of ZJW on the proliferation and apoptosis of HCT116/L-OHP cells. (a)
  CCK-8 results show that HCT116/L-OHP cells were more resistant to oxaliplatin than
  sensitive HCT116 cells. (b) The results show that the IC10 dosage in HCT116/L-OHP
  cells was 20 μg/mL. (c) HCT116/L-OHP cells were treated with different concentrations
  of oxaliplatin for 48 hours, and the inhibitory effect of ZJW combined with L-OHP
  on HCT116/L-OHP cells was stronger than that of L-OHP alone. (d and e) Flow cytometry
  results show the apoptosis rates of HCT116/L-OHP cells treated with ZJW, L-OHP,
  or L-OHP combined with different concentrations of ZJW. ∗∗, P < 0.01; ∗∗∗, P < 0.001
  compared to HCT116/L-OHP.
