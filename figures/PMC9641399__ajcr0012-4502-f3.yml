caption: IVM inhibited the metastasis of HCT-8 cells-derived tumor in vivo. The NOD/SCID
  mice were injected through tail vein with 2 × 106 HCT-8 cells. The mice were then
  treated with different doses of IVM (0, 1, 2, or 3 mg/kg, i.p.) daily for 37 days.
  A. The mouse tissues that contained tumor nodules. White arrows indicated the metastatic
  tumor nodules. B. The histochemicl examination of the tumor mass found in muscle
  tissue with hematoxylin and eosin staining. Scale bars = 150 μm. N, non-tumor tissues;
  T, tumor tissues. C. The comparison of the body weight of the HCT-8 cells-inoculated
  mice after IVM treatment. The numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3 in the figure keys represented
  the IVM doses 0, 1, 2, and 3 mg/kg, respectively. Data were presented as the mean
  ± SD (n = 6). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, compared with the vehicle controls.
