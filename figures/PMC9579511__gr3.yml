caption: Characterization of pathway affected by MRP deletions by single-cell analysis(A)
  A t-SNE plot of malignant single cells from the HNSCC dataset. Each dot represents
  the tumor from which the cell comes from. Cells are colored according to the average
  expression of affected MRP genes.(B) Pseudotime trajectory of malignant cells of
  HNS6 tumor constructed on a reversed graph embedding method. Cells were colored
  according to trajectory states divided into four main clusters (left) or progression
  of pseudotime (right).(C) Single-cell trajectory analysis of HNS6 tumor colored
  by the average expression of affected MRP genes.(D) The t-SNE dimension is reduction
  divided into four main clusters according to trajectory analysis from B.(E) Boxplots
  of Inferred copy number (log2) of affected MRP genes in four clusters according
  to trajectory analysis of HNS6 from B. Data are represented as mean ± SEM.(F) Violin
  plots of inferred copy number (log2) of affected MRP genes in four clusters according
  to trajectory analysis of HNSCC cells from 10 tumors. Statistical significance was
  tested by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s correction for multiple testing. ∗p <0.05;
  ∗∗∗p <0.005; ∗∗∗∗p <0.0005; ns indicates p ≥ 0.05. Data are represented as mean ±
  SEM.(G) Violin plots of inferred copy number (log2) of unaffected MRP genes in four
  clusters according to trajectory analysis of HNSCC cells from 10 tumors. ns indicates
  p ≥ 0.05. Data are represented as mean ± SEM.(H) Gene set enrichment analysis of
  four clusters whose distribution is significantly altered across affected MRP genes
  progression and pseudotime. Density of pathways that were significantly enriched
  in either cluster is listed. The x axis represents a normalized enrichment score
  (NES). The ordinate indicates the top-ranked signal pathways enriched by KEGG in
  different clusters. The box on the right summarizes the types of signal pathways.(I)
  Schematic diagram of the four stages across affected MRP genes progression and pseudotime.(J)
  Single-cell trajectory analysis of HNS6 tumor colored by the gene set variation
  analysis (GSVA) score of stemness genes.(K) Violin plots of GSVA score of stemness
  genes in four clusters according to trajectory analysis of HNSCC cells from 10 tumors.
  ∗p <0.05; ∗∗∗p <0.005. Data are represented as mean ± SEM.(L) Single-cell trajectory
  analysis of HNS6 tumor colored by the GSVA score of TCA cycle genes.(M) Violin plots
  of GSVA score of TCA cycle genes in four clusters according to trajectory analysis
  of HNSCC cells from 10 tumors. ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗∗p <0.005. Data are represented as mean ±
  SEM.(N) Correlation matrix plots showing the correlation between affected MRP genes
  expression and enrichment score of three gene sets (TCA cycle, DNA repair, and Stemness)
  from single cells in eight different cancer types. The size of the dots indicates
  the absolute value of Pearson’s correlation coefficient. The pink color stands for
  a negative correlation, and the purple one stands for a positive correlation.
