caption: Role of OLNZ in NeuN immunoreactive cells in the CA1 area of the hippocampus.
  Identification of NeuN+ cells in the sham group (A) 10× and (a) 200x, TI-mediated
  ischemic stroke group (B) 10× and (b) 200x, and TI-mediated ischemic stroke + OLNZ
  (10mg/kg) group (C) 10× and (c) 200x. A small quantity of NeuN immunoreactive cells
  was superficially noticeable in the TI-mediated stroke animals in comparison with
  the OLNZ-treated animals. (D) The graph signifies the relative numbers of immunoreactive
  NeuN+ cells. Data were expressed as the mean ± SEM, n = 5 in each group. After performing
  one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc tests, p < 0.05 for comparisons of the treatment
  groups with the sham group (#) and p < 0.05 for comparisons with the TI-induced
  stroke group (*) were considered significant.
