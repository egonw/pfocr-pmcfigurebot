caption: Tryptophan metabolism pathway in S. grandis in response to heavy grazing.
  (A) Joint analysis of the DAMs, DEPs, and DEGs. Red and blue letters represent up-
  and down-regulation, respectively. Upper-case letters indicate proteins and italicized
  upper-case letters indicate genes. Orange lines represent biosynthetic steps that
  are not clear. The heatmap represents the corresponding expression levels of (B)
  DAMs, (C) DEPs, and (D) DEGs in the NG and HG groups. The color scale indicates
  the relative expression level.
