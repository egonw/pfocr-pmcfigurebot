caption: Significant differentially expressed genes between chidamide and vehicle
  separated by sex (A). Males showed greater DEGs in response to chidamide treatment
  than females. Pathway analysis shows a majority of pathways, including the neuroinflammatory
  pathway and amyloid processing pathway, are upregulated in male chidamide-treated
  mice compared to vehicle-treated males, while a majority of pathways are downregulated
  in female chidamide-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated females (B). NanoString
  data analyzed using nSolver Analysis Software 4.0; heatmaps created with Morpheus
  Software.
