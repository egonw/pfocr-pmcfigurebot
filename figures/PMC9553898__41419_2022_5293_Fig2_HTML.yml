figure_title: Rptor deficiency disrupts estrous cycle homeostasis while maintaining
  normal ovarian function
caption: 'A Representative images for cytological assessment of vaginal smears of
  control and Rptor cKO mice using crystal violet staining method for estrous cycle
  determination. n = 5 mice in each group. Microscopy with magnification ×20. Scale
  bars: 100 μm. B Morphologic changes in the vaginal mucosa during the mouse estrus
  cycle by HE staining. n = 5 mice at each stage. Microscopy with magnification ×10.
  Scale bars: 200 μm. C Estrous cyclings in 8-week-old control (n = 5) and Rptor cKO
  (n = 7) mice were determined daily by vaginal lavage cytology for 13 days. Values
  are expressed as the mean ± SEM. D Representative HE-stained ovarian sections of
  control and Rptor cKO mice at 8~10 weeks of age. n = 5 mice in each group. Microscopy
  with magnification ×4. Scale bars: 1 mm. E Representative HE-stained ovarian sections
  of control (n = 8) and Rptor cKO (n = 6) mice at 8~10 weeks of age after superovulation.
  Microscopy with magnification ×4. Scale bars: 1 mm. F Oocytes were collected from
  the oviducts of superovulated control (n = 8) and Rptor cKO (n = 6) mice. Microscopy
  with magnification ×10. Scale bars: 100 μm. G Scatter plot shows the statistics
  of oocyte number between the two groups of mice in F. Values are expressed as the
  mean ± SEM. H, I Serum E2 (H) and P4 (I) levels in control and Rptor cKO mice during
  proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus. n = 5 (control mice at proestrus stage),
  n = 8 (control mice at estrus stage), n = 15 (control mice at metestrus stage),
  n = 10 (control mice at diestrus stage), and n = 9 (Rptor cKO mice). Values are
  expressed as the mean ± SEM.'
