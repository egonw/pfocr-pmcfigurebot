caption: 'Changes of β-catenin and SIRT1 protein in spinal cord injury rats. (a, b)
  The (a) β-catenin and (b) SIRT1 expression in the spinal cord tissue of SCI rat
  at different time points were detected by immunofluorescence; (c) Western blot were
  used to determine the expression of β-catenin, SIRT1, FOXO4, and Caspase-3 in SCI
  rats. N = 5 per group. ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01; ∗∗∗P < 0.001vs. sham group. SCI: spinal
  cord injury.'
