caption: 'tFNAs regulated the secretion of growth factors and the Wnt signalling pathway
  in diabetic wounds. (A) ELISA results of bFGF, TGF‐β1 and VEGF‐A secretion in the
  control and tFNAs groups. (B) Immunofluorescence to check for the expression of
  LEF1 and TCF1 in the control and tFNAs groups (nucleus: blue; LEF1: red; TCF1: pink).
  Scale bars are 50 μm. (C) Western blot detection of β‐catenin, c‐Myc and cyclin
  D1 expression in the control and tFNAs groups. (D) Semi‐quantification of Wnt signalling
  pathway protein levels in (C). Data are presented as the mean ± SD (n = 3). Significance:
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001'
