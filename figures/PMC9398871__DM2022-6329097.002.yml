caption: circCNN2 promotes cell proliferation and invasion in LUSC. (a, b) CCK-8 and
  colony formation assays were conducted to evaluate the proliferative ability of
  H1703 and H226 cells after circCNN2 was silenced. (c) Western blot analysis was
  performed to examine the protein levels of PCNA and cyclin D1 in H1703 and H226
  cells upon circCNN2 silencing. (d, e) Transwell assays were performed to analyze
  the effect of circCNN2 silencing on LUSC cell invasion. (f) Western blot analysis
  was used to examine the protein levels of invasion-related proteins MMP2 and MMP9
  in LUSC cells. ∗∗P < 0.01 compared to the sh-NC group.
