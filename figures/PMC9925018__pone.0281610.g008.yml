figure_title: Proposed model for KDM4D and Hippo signaling pathway in the regulation
  of cell cycle activities
caption: KDM4D preferentially induced expression of genes regulating late (G2/M) phases
  of the cell cycle by stimulating E2F1 and FoxM1 expression, while miR-199 or Hippo
  pathway inhibition preferentially up-regulated genes involved in G1/S phase by stimulating
  Myc expression.
article_title: Hippo signaling and histone methylation control cardiomyocyte cell
  cycle re-entry through distinct transcriptional pathways.
