caption: 'Glycyrrhetinic acid has protective effects against Sunitinib-induced hepatotoxicity.
  (A) Cytotoxicity of glycyrrhetinic acid at various concentration for 6 + 48 h in
  L02 cells (n = 4–6). (B) The viability of hepatocytes was analyzed by MTT after
  L02 cells were incubated with 5, 10, 15 μM Sunitinib for 48 h in the presence or
  absence of 50 μM glycyrrhetinic acid pretreatment for 6 h (n = 6). (C) ALT, AST
  and LDH levels in the supernatant after L02 cells were incubated with 10 μM Sunitinib
  for 48 h in the presence or absence of 50 μM glycyrrhetinic acid pretreatment for
  6 h (n = 3). (D,E) LC3B levels in L02 cells after Sunitinib (10 μM) for 48 h in
  the presence or absence of 50 μM glycyrrhetinic acid pretreatment for 6 h (n = 3).
  **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 vs. Control group. #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01 and ###p <
  0.001 vs. Sunitinib group.'
