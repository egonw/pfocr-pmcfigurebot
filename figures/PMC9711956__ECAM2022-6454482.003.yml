caption: Cordycepin affects the metabolic process of aerobic glycolysis. (a) Effect
  of cordycepin on lactic acid secretion. Cordycepin inhibits the secretion of lactic
  acid after 24 h of treatment. (b) Effect of cordycepin on pyruvate kinase secretion.
  Cordycepin inhibits the secretion of pyruvate kinase after 24 h treatment. (c) Glucose
  uptake was suppressed by cordycepin treatment at different concentrations. HCC-LM3
  (d) and Hep-G2 (e) cells were treated with different concentrations of cordycepin
  for 12 h. ECAR was detected by the seahorse XF24 extracellular flux analyzer using
  the glycolysis stress test kit. Cordycepin treatment decreased ECAR in HCC-LM3 and
  Hep-G2 cells. Data are expressed as means ± SD. ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01; ∗∗∗P < 0.001
  (vs. control group, n = 3).
