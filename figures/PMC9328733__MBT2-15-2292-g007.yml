caption: Influence of up‐regulation of β‐alanine metabolism on the metabolic flux
  of MVA pathway. (A) Relative transcription levels of GAD1, PAN6, and CAB1 in YS58‐derived
  strains. (B) Squalene content of YS58‐derived strains. (C) Fold change of transcription
  levels of GAD1, PAN6 and CAB1 in strain SQ3‐4 vs SQ3‐3. (D) Cell growth and squalene
  content of strains SQ3‐3 and SQ3‐4. Yeast cells were cultivated in YPD with yeast
  extract YE‐O or YE‐N, respectively, at 30°C and 200 rpm for 24 h. Data are presented
  as the means of three biological replicates. Error bars represent standard deviations
  (n = 3). Student’s t‐test was used for statistical analysis (*P < 0.05; * *P < 0.01;
  ***P < 0.001).
