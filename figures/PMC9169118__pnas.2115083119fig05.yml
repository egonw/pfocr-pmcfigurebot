caption: Other scramblases might contribute to translocation of GlcN-PI in the absence
  of CLPTM1L. (A) Flow cytometry analysis of various human cultured cell lines with
  CLPTM1L deficiency. Cells stably expressing lentiCRISPR v2 with CLPTM1L-targeting
  sgRNAs were stained with anti-CD59 mAb. (B) Flow cytometry analysis of CLPTM1L-KO
  HEK293 cells stained with anti-CD59 mAb. Overexpression of CLPTM1L-FH, CLPTM1-FH,
  and mTMEM16K-FH controlled by the Tet-On system was induced by 1 µg/mL Dox. In A
  and B, data on the right are mean ± SD of three independent biological repeats.
  In B, P values are from one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test for multiple comparisons.
  (C) Scheme depicting a FACS-based genome-wide CRISPR screen for genes involved in
  GPI biosynthesis using CLPTM1L-KO HEK293 cells. (D) Flow cytometry analysis of CLPTM1L-KO
  HEK293 cells during the FACS-based genome-wide CRISPR screen. Starting clone, cells
  after mutagenesis, sort1 cells, and sort2 cells were stained with anti-CD59 and
  anti-CD55/DAF antibodies. (E) Gene scores in unsorted versus sorted CLPTM1L-KO cells.
  Known GPI biosynthetic pathway genes are shown in green. CLPTM1 and reported ER
  scramblase genes, including TMEM41B, VMP1, and TMEM16K/ANO10, are shown in pink.
  The ranking numbers based on the gene scores are shown in parentheses after gene
  names. See also Datasets S4 and S5.
