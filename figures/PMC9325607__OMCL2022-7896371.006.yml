caption: 'The characterization and functional analysis of key metabolites. WT: wild-type
  (Period2+/+) mice; KO: Per2 gene knockout (Period2−/−) mice. (a) The classification
  of significantly differential metabolites. (b) Bar chart of the significant differential
  metabolites belonged to amino acids. (c) Bar chart of the significant differential
  metabolites belonged to carbohydrates. (d) Significant metabolic pathway maps enriched
  in KEGG database. Large sizes and dark colors represent high pathway impact and
  major pathway enrichment, respectively.'
