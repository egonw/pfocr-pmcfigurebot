caption: 'Effects of the intestinal microbiota of layers on egg quality and safety.
  Suggested mechanisms of microbial action are as follows: ① Intestinal bacteria can
  spread to the oviduct through the cloaca leading to egg contaminations, and accelerating
  the formation of egg translucency through bacterial penetration. In addition, oviducal
  bacteria biosynthesize pigments affecting the eggshell color. Moreover, oviducal
  pathogenic bacteria activate the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway inducing the synthesis
  of IL-1β and IL-6, which affects the eggshell ultrastructure by inhibiting the protein
  expression of a calcium-binding protein and Ca2+ transport. ② Short-chain fatty
  acids (SCFAs) produced by intestinal microbiota reduce the luminal pH and enhances
  calcium solubility, utilization, and deposition to improve eggshell thickness. ③
  SCFAs bind to G protein-coupled receptor 43 (GPR43) to activate Wnt signaling in
  the bone marrow stromal cells to improve the Ca2+ homeostasis of bone metabolism
  and eggshell quality. ④ Trimethylamine (TMA) produced by intestinal microbiota is
  deposited in egg yolks, resulting in an unpleasant fishy odor. ⑤ Intestinal probiotics
  can activate the Nrf2 signaling pathway in the liver to regulate the antioxidant
  status and metabolic functions, which may improve albumen quality. ⑥ Bile acids
  (BA) produced by intestinal microbiota modulate lipid metabolism and intestinal
  absorption to improve the egg yolk color. ⑦ SCFAs, BA, and indole derivatives can
  directly interact with intrinsic enteric neurons and gut-innervating vagal and spinal
  afferents to regulate the secretion of estradiol, which regulates the secretion
  of proteins in the oviducal magnum and finally completes the regulation of albumen
  quality.'
