caption: Involvement of E2F signaling pathway in the proliferation of the immortalized
  BMECs. (A) Western blotting analysis of CDK4, CDK6, cyclin D1, cyclin D3, and CDK2
  in primary and immortalized BMECs. (B) Western blotting analysis of E2F1, E2F2,
  and E2F3 in primary and immortalized BMECs. Primary BMECs or BMECs immortalized
  by E6E7 and SV40T were collected at early (E) and late (L) passages of culture.
  Data are based on triplicate experiments.
