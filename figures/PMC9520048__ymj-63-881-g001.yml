figure_title: 'Transdermal drug delivery methods using MNs. MNs are applied to the
  skin. Solid MNs method: skin is pretreated with solid MNs. Then, a drug-loaded patch
  is applied to the pretreated skin, and the drug is absorbed through the pores. Coated
  MNs method: after injecting the drug-coated MNs, the drug coating melts away from
  the MNs with the aqueous environment of the skin. Dissolving MNs method: drug-loaded
  MNs are made of a water-soluble or biodegradable material and encapsulate the target
  drug. As the MNs dissolve, the drug is released together. Hollow MNs method: the
  liquid formulation drugs are injected by applied pressure and flow through the hollow
  pathway in the MNs. MNs, microneedles'
