caption: tRF-24-V29K9UV3IU inhibits GPR78 expression by binding its 3′-UTR in GC cells.
  (a) Eight DEGs predicted to possibly bind tRF-24-V29K9UV3IU through overlap of DEGs
  and the Miranda and RNAhybrid database. (b) The regulatory network of tRF-24-V29K9UV3IU.
  The rounded rectangle represents tRF-24-V29K9UV3IU, the ellipse represents mRNA,
  the diamond represents a pathway, and the red/green color indicates upregulation
  and down-regulation, respectively. ((c)–(e)) Expression of GPR78, OLR1, and VEPH1
  as verified by qRT-PCR. (f) Putative binding site of tRF-24-V29K9UV3IU on GPR78.
  (g) The luciferase activity of GPR78 in MKN-45 cells after cotransfection with tRF-24-V29K9UV3IU
  mimics or NC. (h) An AGO2-RIP assay was conducted to confirm that tRF-24-V29K9UV3IU
  associates with AGO2. (i) Expression of GPR78 in 19 pairs tumor and normal tissues
  detected by qRT-PCR. Expression of GPR78 was up-regulated in tumor compared to normal
  tissues. (j) The expression of GPR78 and tRF-24-V29K9UV3IU was negatively correlated,
  which was analyzed by Pearson's correlation in tumors. The above experiments were
  repeated three times. t test, ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
