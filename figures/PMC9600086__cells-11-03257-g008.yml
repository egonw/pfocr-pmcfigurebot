caption: The effect of methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) treatment on the β3-adrenoreceptor
  (AR)-cGMP pathway in different lines of hPSC-CMs. Bar chart and model trace illustrating
  the effect of MβCD treatment on the cGMP production upon β3 -AR stimulation with
  isoproterenol (ISO) in (a,b) IMR-hPSC-CMs (IMR) Day 30, (c,d) IMR-hPSC-CMs (IMR)
  Day 90, (e,f) CDI-hPSC-CMs (CDI) grown in our lab for 40 days, (g,h) H9-hPSC-CMs
  (H9LV) Day 20. All data is composed of three independent experimental batches. ***
