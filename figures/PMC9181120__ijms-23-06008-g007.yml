caption: Characterization and functional analysis of key metabolic pathways and correlations
  between gut microbes, SCFAs proportions, and metabolites. NLD, the antibiotic-treated
  mice managed under normal light–dark cycle; SD, the antibiotic-treated mice managed
  under short-day cycle. Pathways were enriched via enrichment and topology analysis
  of significantly different metabolites in colonic contents (A), colonic epithelium
  (B), cecal contents (C), and cecal epithelium (D) in ABX mice under NLD and SD.
  Large sizes and red colors represent high pathway impact and major pathway enrichment,
  while small sizes and other colors represent low pathway impact and minor pathway
  enrichment. Variable importance in projection (VIP) scores of metabolites in the
  purine metabolism pathway were also obtained from the PLS-DA models in colonic epithelium
  (E) and cecal epithelium (F). Red dots represented decreased and green dots represented
  increased. Relevant metabolic pathways map based on the proportions of differential
  metabolites of purine metabolism pathway in colonic epithelium (G) and cecal epithelium
  (H), * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01. Red represented decreased and blue represented increased.
  Pearson correlation coefficients between the relative abundance of gut microbes
  in intestinal contents and epithelium of Bacteroidetes phylum, Firmicutes phylum,
  Clostridiales order, Lachnospiraceae family, and Ruminococcaceae family (I) were
  analyzed in ABX mice, red line represented the best-fit line and grey region represented
  the 95% confidence band of the best-fit line. Pearson correlation coefficients between
  the relative abundance of gut microbes and the proportions of SCFAs (J) were analyzed
  in ABX mice. Pearson correlation coefficients between the relative abundance of
  gut microbes and the significantly differential metabolites in purine and pyrimidine
  metabolism pathways (K) were also analyzed in ABX mice. The Pearson correlation
  coefficients (R) are shown on the plots; positive correlations are displayed in
  red and negative correlations are shown in blue, while the (R) shown in the grid
  proved that the correlation reached a significant level, p < 0.05.
