figure_title: Changes in the central carbon metabolism of P. putida cscRABY grown
  in co-culture
caption: 'a Proteome level: Differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) are highlighted
  in orange (more abundant) or grey (less abundant). Superscript numbers indicate
  the log2-fold change (log2-FC). b Transcriptome level: DEGs encoding proteins putatively
  involved in AA (amino acid) synthesis and degradation, or the TCA (tricarboxylic
  acid) cycle, the EDEMP (Entner-Doudoroff-Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas)-cycle, or the FA
  (fatty acid) synthesis and degradation. The blue shaded area indicates the p-value
  of 0.05. c Metabolome level: metabolites identified by reference measurements comparing
  the co-culture to P. putida cscRABY and grouped into pathways by a pathway enrichment
  analysis. Data was obtained by using the metabolic pathway analysis of MetaboAnalyst
  5.0. Abbreviations: 1 = Phe/Tyr Metabolism, amino acids are abbreviated with the
  three-letter code, and M stands for metabolism.'
