caption: The effect of TAMs in different solid cancers. In pancreatic cancer, TAMs
  promote PD-L1 expression in cancer cells through TNF-α/NF-kB pathway. In liver cancer,
  TAMs promote PD-L1 expression in cancer cells through the IL-1β/ERK pathway. In
  gastric cancer, TAMs promote PD-L1 expression in cancer cells through IL-1/STAT
  and TNF-α/NF-kB pathways. In lung cancer, TAMs promote PD-L1 expression in cancer
  cells through IFN-γ/PI3K/AKT and IFN-γ/STAT3 pathways. In breast cancer, TAMs promote
  PD-L1 expression in cancer cells through TNF-α/IKK pathway. In ovarian cancer, TAMs
  promote PD-L1 expression in cancer cells through IFN-γ/PI3K/AKT and IFN-γ/ERK1 pathways
