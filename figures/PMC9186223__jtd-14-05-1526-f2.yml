caption: 'Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) promotes the expression of α-smooth muscle
  actin (α-SMA) in the atrial fibroblasts. (A) The expression of α-SMA and Collagen
  I detected by Western blot; (B,C) statistical analysis of the results of α-SMA and
  the protein expression of Collagen I (n=3); (D) immunofluorescence image of α-SMA
  (scale =20 µm); (E) statistical analysis of α-SMA immunofluorescence expression
  (n=3); the blue is the nucleus, and the green is the α-SMA. The values are expressed
  as the mean ± standard deviation. *P<0.05, compared to the control group; #P<0.05,
  compared to the 100 µM of TMAO group.'
article_title: The transformation of atrial fibroblasts into myofibroblasts is promoted
  by trimethylamine N-oxide via the Wnt3a/β-catenin signaling pathway.
