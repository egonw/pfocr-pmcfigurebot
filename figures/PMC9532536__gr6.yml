caption: 'GRP78 as regulator of FOXM1–KIF20A pathway. (A) GRP78 activity measurement
  on recombinant GRP78 protein and cells lysates treated with different concentrations
  of CuB (n = 3). Left: Effects on purified recombinant GRP78 protein. Right: Effects
  on the CRMM2 and HL7702 cells lysates. The results are expressed as percentages
  of control (DMSO). (B) Immunoblotting for GRP78 in CRMM2 and HL7702 cells with or
  without CuB treatment (n = 3). (C) Effects of GRP78 knockdown or over-expression
  on CRMM2 cells proliferation and cell cycle. Left: Western blot of GRP78 after GRP78
  shRNA and GRP78 over-expression infection. Middle: Effects on CRMM2 cells proliferation
  after CuB treatment with GRP78 shRNA and GRP78 over-expression infection (IC50 values).
  Right: Effects on G2/M cell cycle of CuB treatment (0.1 and 0.2 μmol/L) after GRP78
  shRNA and GRP78 over-expression infection in CRMM2 cells. Data are mean ± SD, n = 3;
  ns, no significance; ∗∗P < 0.01; ∗∗∗P < 0.001 compared to sh-NC control group, two-way
  ANOVA. (D) The expression of proteins viz. FOXM1, PLK1, KIF20A, CyclinB1 and CDK1
  was decreased in CRMM2, CM-AS16, CRMM1 and CM2005.1 cells after treatment with shGRP78s
  (n = 3).'
