caption: 'The silencing of SAAL1 alleviated LPS-induced cell apoptosis in vitro. (A)
  The protein levels of SAAL1 in the A549 cells stimulated with LPS was checked by
  western blotting assays. (B) The protein level of SAAL1 in the A549 cells was checked
  by western blotting assays. (C) The cell viability was checked by CCK-8 assays.
  (D) The cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. (E) The protein levels of
  Ki67, Bcl-2, caspase-1, and Bax in the A549 cells were detected by western blotting
  assays. **, P<0.01 vs. control group; ##, P<0.01 vs. si-NC + LPS group. SAAL1, serum
  amyloid A-like 1; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; CCK-8, Cell Counting Kit-8; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate dehydrogenase; si-NC, small interfering RNA negative control.'
