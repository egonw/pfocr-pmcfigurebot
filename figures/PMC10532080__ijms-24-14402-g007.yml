caption: Intrabodies against BAP31 enhance antitumor effects of 5-FU in vivo. (A)
  HCT116 cells were transfected with plasmids containing different VH antibody genes
  (A5, A17, G10, and G18). Western blot assay was used to detect the effect of VH
  intrabodies on galectin-3 and β-catenin expression. (B) Tumors were harvested and
  photographed. (C) Growth curves of each group of tumors. (D) Each group of tumors
  was removed and weighed. (E) Ki67 was evaluated by IHC in mouse xenografts; TUNEL
  assay of tumor tissue from different treatment groups was performed. Nuclei were
  stained with DAPI (blue). Scale bar, 100 μm. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
