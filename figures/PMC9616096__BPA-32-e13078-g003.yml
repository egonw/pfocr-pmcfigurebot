caption: Schematic model of MN phenotypes described as a function of mfSOD1 expression
  and vacuolar degeneration. Phenotype 1 is similar to WT. in phenotype 2, mfSOD1
  together with large mitochondrial vacuoles are abundant MN dendrites and axons but
  nearly absent in cell bodies. In MN somata, some ER‐derived vesicles enriched in
  mfSOD1 accumulate and presumably fuse with mitochondria, producing an early expansion
  of their intermembranous space (a). In the type 3 phenotype, both MN cell bodies
  and processes are filled with vacuoles of heterogeneous size. Giant vacuoles result
  from the fusion of several mitochondria and ER vacuolar elements (b). In these vacuoles,
  mitochondrial and nonmitochondrial molecular components (PDH, Chrg, CD81, and flotillin)
  are shared in the same membrane‐limited compartment. A minor proportion of vacuoles
  do not contain mfSOD1 but display positivity for p62, ubiquitin, and the mitochondrial
  marker PDH, indicating that they are mitophagic in nature (c). The necroptotic pathway
  is activated in MNs with the type 3 phenotype because pMLKL is present in some vacuoles
  (d). The end stage of the evolution of MNs with vacuolar degeneration involves their
  complete cytolysis with the release of mfSOD1‐enriched vesicles to the extracellular
  space and the subsequent induction of a local neuroinflammatory response and the
  spreading of the disease (microglia, mg). Note the progressive loss of afferent
  synaptic inputs to MNs and the absence of chromatin condensation during the degenerative
  processes.
