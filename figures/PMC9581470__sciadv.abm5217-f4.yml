figure_title: Activity of the VTA-to-VP GABA pathway scales with the value of a primary
  reward
caption: '(A) Heatmap of calcium-dependent fluorescence signals in VTA-to-VP GABA
  neurons across five CRT sessions on consecutive days. Signals were aligned to the
  time of magazine entry (0 s). (B) Area under the curve (AUC) of fluorescence signals
  measured from (A). Upper panel shows the fluorescence change across five sessions.
  Lower panel shows the AUCs calculated from the upper panel curves from 0 to 5 s
  (gray area). Each dot represents the averaged AUC of the fluorescence signals measured
  in one mouse in one session. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the signal
  AUC across five sessions: F(4,30) = 0.034; P = 0.998. N = 7 mice. (C) Heatmap of
  fluorescence signals in terminals of VTA-to-VP GABA neurons during FR1 responding
  to different sizes of reward (reward delivery for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 s). (D) AUC
  of fluorescence signals measured from (C). Upper panel shows the fluorescence change
  in response to different sizes of reward. Lower panel shows the AUCs calculated
  from the upper panel curves. One-way ANOVA of the signal AUC across reward sizes:
  F(5,30) = 18.6; P = 2.2 × 10−8. N = 6 mice. (E) Heatmap of fluorescence signals
  in VTA-to-VP GABA neurons during FR1 responding to different dilutions of reward
  with the same reward delivery for 2 s. (F) AUC of fluorescence signals measured
  from (E). Upper panel shows the fluorescence change in response to different dilutions
  of reward. Lower panel shows the AUCs calculated from the upper panel curves. One-way
  ANOVA of the signal AUC across different dilutions: F(4,20) = 14.7; P = 9.4 × 10−6.
  N = 5 mice.'
