figure_title: TMEM173 (STING) and IRF3 are excessively expressed in liver fibrosis
  tissues from liver cancer patients
caption: '(A) The GSE number and sample quality for RNA microarray analysis of liver
  cancer tissue (tumor tissue, n=4) and normal adjacent tissue (ctrl, n=4) from GSE99807.
  (B) A volcano map derived from the differentially expressed genes (screening condition,
  p<0.05) between liver cancer tissue (tumor tissue, n=4) and normal adjacent tissue
  (ctrl, n=4) from GSE99807. (C) Using the differentially expressed genes between
  liver cancer tissue (tumor tissue, n=4) and normal adjacent tissue (ctrl, n=4) from
  GSE99807 to perform KEGG signal enrichment. (D) Using the differentially expressed
  genes in liver cancer tissue (tumor tissue, n=4) and normal adjacent tissue (ctrl,
  n=4) from GSE99807 to perform GOBP enrichment. (E and F) The expression distribution
  of TMEM173 and IRF3 genes in tissues (G1: normal, n=6; G2: liver fibrosis, n=6)
  from GSE33650, the upper left corner shows the significance p-value test method.
  COL1A1, collagen type I alpha 1 chain; STING, stimulator of interferon genes; IRF3,
  interferon regulatory factor 3.'
