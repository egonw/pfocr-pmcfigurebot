caption: Ocular glymphatic system. Schematic showing the current understanding of
  the ocular glymphatic system. Following production, a major portion of AH leaves
  the eye via the anterior outflow pathway (brown arrows). A small portion of AH enters
  the vitreous chamber (green arrows), from where AH enters the neural retina due
  to intraocular pressure. In the retina, AH mixes with interstitial fluid and transport
  along retinal ganglion cell axons across the lamina cribrosa barrier. From there,
  AH leaves the axons, travel towards the perivenous space, and finally drains into
  cervical lymph nodes (blue arrow) via meningeal lymphatic vessels. Likewise, the
  optic nerve has a distinct glymphatic system. In this pathway, CSF from the sub-arachnoid
  space (SAS) enters the optic nerve parenchyma (purple arrows) along the periarterial
  space. Following glymphatic activity, CSF then leaves the optic nerve via perivenous
  space before draining into cervical lymph nodes via meningeal lymphatics.
