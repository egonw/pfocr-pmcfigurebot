figure_title: NSE downregulates and interacts with NBL1 in SCLC cells
caption: A, B Western blot images showed the interaction between NSE and NBL1 by Co-IP
  experiment. C The double-immunofluorescence labeling experiment detected NSE and
  NBL1 and displayed co-location in clinical samples (original magnification ×40,
  scale bar 50 μm). D Western blot images show the interaction of BMP2 and BMPR1A
  enhanced after overexpression of NSE. E The photo shows a significant and negative
  correlation between ENO2 (encode NSE) and NBL1 in mRNA level using the CCLE database.
article_title: Neuron-specific enolase promotes stem cell-like characteristics of
  small-cell lung cancer by downregulating NBL1 and activating the BMP2/Smad/ID1 pathway.
