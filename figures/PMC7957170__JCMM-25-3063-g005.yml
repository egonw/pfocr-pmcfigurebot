caption: KEGG, PPI and signalling pathway analyses. The main enriched signalling pathways
  were the IL‐17 signalling pathway, the axon guidance signalling pathway and drug
  metabolism signalling pathway. A, PPI networks reflect the interactions of proteins
  with other proteins. In the comparison of the POAG combined with cataract group
  with the cataract group, red represents up‐regulated proteins, and green represents
  down‐regulated proteins. The size of the circle represents the amount of the related
  protein (B). The signalling pathways were acquired from our data analysis and previous
  articles (C and D)
