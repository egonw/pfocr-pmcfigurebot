caption: SIRT4 participates in modulating r-MC autophagic function through AMPK/mTOR
  signaling pathway. (A,B) Protein expression levels of p-AMPK and p-mTOR in whole-cell
  lysates from cells transfected with V-SIRT4 (n = 4 per group; ** p < 0.01). (C)
  ATP generation of MGCs transfected with V-SIRT4. Data are shown as means ± SEMs
  (n = 3 per group; *** p < 0.001). (D–H) Protein expression levels of SIRT4, p-AMPK,
  p-mTOR, LC3, and SQSTM1/p62 in whole-cell lysates from cells transfected with V-SIRT4
  and treated with compound C (n = 3 per group; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p
  < 0.001). p62, SQSTM1/p62.
