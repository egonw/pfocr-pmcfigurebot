caption: 'Two distinct phenotypes of SCLC cell line NCI-H69. (A) The arrows indicated
  the bright-field images of H69A and H69S cells. Magnification, ×200. (B) H69A and
  H69S cells were cultured for 48 h and then stained with trypan blue. Cell proliferation
  was analyzed using Countstar. (C) H69A and H69S cells were each cultured for 24
  and 48 h and then stained with trypan blue. Adherent cells and suspended cells were
  collected. Cell numbers were counted using Countstar. (D) H69A and H69S cells were
  collected and western blotting was used to detect the expression of SYP and CD44.
  GAPDH was the internal standard. (E) Quantitative analysis of (D): H69A was the
  control (100%). Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation of three independent
  experiments. (F) Western blotting was used to detect the expression of ASCL1, NEUROD1,
  POU2F3, YAP1 and GAPDH. (G) Quantitative analysis of (F): H69A was the control (100%).
  Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments.
