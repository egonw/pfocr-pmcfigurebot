caption: Fibrosis in CTX-induced injury models. After injury, FAPs are activated and
  begin to proliferate and then differentiate into fibroblasts and adipocytes. Fibroblasts
  secrete extracellular matrix proteins and growth factors, and differentiate into
  myofibroblasts to increase α-SMA expression and ECM synthesis, which may provide
  scaffolds for the skeletal muscle regeneration while abnormal deposition of ECM
  finally results in fibrosis. In CTX-induced injury muscle, increases in miR-199a-5p,
  growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11), platelet-derived growth factor receptor
  beta (PDGFRβ), lack of GDF-associated serum protein-1 (Gasp1) and/or Gasp2, and
  a prior burst of double homeobox 4 (DUX40) induce the deposition of collagen and
  contribute to fibrosis. In contrast, laminin-111 and Losartam therapy reduce fibrosis.
  Additionally, IL-4/IL-13 signaling, EGF and BTC, and the RA signaling pathway also
  regulate the fate of FAPs in skeletal muscle regeneration.
