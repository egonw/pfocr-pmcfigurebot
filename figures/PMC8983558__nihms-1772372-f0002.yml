figure_title: Phosphoproteome responses to AXL inhibition by RXDX106 in H1299 lung
  cancer cells
caption: (A) Immunoblot analysis of downstream signaling in H1299 after treatment
  either with 100 nM RXDX106 for the indicated times or AXL siRNA for 48h. Shown is
  a representative of three replicate experiments (B) Proximity ligation assay for
  AXL-pY complexes in the indicated cell lines with or without exposure to 1 μM RXDX106
  for 1h. Images were acquired at 40X magnification. Shown is a representative of
  two replicate experiments (C) Overview of proteins modulated by tyrosine phosphorylation
  after RXDX106 exposure, grouped according to their cellular function. Each functional
  group is represented by a different color/shape as shown in the legend (D) Peptide
  sequences of proteins from the pY dataset that overlapped with the BioID data were
  used to build a Position-Specific-Scoring-Matrix (PSSM) AXL pathway substrate motif.
  Also shown are the top 20 putative AXL pathway substrates as a function of their
  mean PAM250 similarity scores (E-F) Scratch wound migration (E) and invasion (F)
  assays where relative wound density of H1299 and Calu1 cells, treated either with
  RXDX106 or AXL siRNA, were analyzed on the IncuCyte every 3h until the scratch wound
  is healed (~48 – 72h). Data is represented as mean ± SE and is representative of
  three replicate experiments (G) Relative viability of NSCLC cell lines expressing
  varying levels of phosphorylated and total AXL as assessed by CellTiter-Glo after
  72 h of treatment with increasing concentrations of RXDX-106. Data are represented
  as mean ± SE and is the average of three replicate experiments.
