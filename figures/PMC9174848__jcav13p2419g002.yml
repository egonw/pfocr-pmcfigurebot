caption: (A, B) The results of the transwell assays showing that FUZ enhances the
  invasion ability of NSCLC cells. (C, D) The results of the wound healing assays
  showing that FUZ promotes the migration ability of NSCLC cells. si-FUZ is FUZ siRNA,
  si-NC is siRNA negative control, pcDNA-FUZ is overexpressed FUZ, and NC is negative
  control. Measurements were taken from three independent experiments. *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001.
