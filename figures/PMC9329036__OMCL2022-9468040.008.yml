caption: NBP inhibited apoptosis of human OA chondrocytes by upregulating FoxO3a.
  (a) Cluster analysis of mRNA levels of downstream genes in the FoxO pathway. (b,
  c) The mRNA levels Bcl-2 and Bax were determined. (d) The protein expressions of
  Bcl-2, Bax, and Caspase 3 were determined. All data are expressed as the mean ±
  standard deviation (SD). ∗P < 0.05,  ∗∗P < 0.01, and∗∗∗P < 0.001.
