figure_title: ST1072 modulates B- and T-cell functions during cGVHD development
caption: BALB/c mice were lethally irradiated and 5×106/mouse TCD-BM or plus 5×106/mouse
  splenocytes from B10.D2 donor mice were transplanted. One group of the recipient
  mice was injected i.p. with ST1072 at 2 mg/kg from day-1 to day 28 or day 28 to
  day 59. The recipients were monitored for body weight and clinical score until 60
  days post-BMT. 60 days post cell transfer, spleens and peripheral lymph nodes (pLNs)
  were collected from the recipient mice and subjected to cell counting and FACS staining.
  Percentage of CD4+ or CD8+ among donor cells and percentage of IFN-γ among CD4+
  or CD8+ donor cells are shown in recipient spleens (A) or periphery lymph nodes
  (pLNs) (B). Percentages of B220+ or B220lowCD138+ and FAS+GL+ (germinal center cell,
  GC cell) are shown among donor B cells in recipient spleens (C). Pooled data is
  summarized with statistical analyses where either treatment (day 0 or 28) was compared
  with vehicle control. Data shown is one of the two replicate experiments. Significance
  is determined by one-way ANOVA (using multiple comparison test). Asterisks indicate
  statistical significance *p< 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
