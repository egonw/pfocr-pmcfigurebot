caption: 'HMC induces Nrf2 signaling in renal tissue. Kidney samples were collected
  24 h after the administration of SDCF for the evaluation of Nrf2 (A), Ho-1 (B),
  and Nqo1 (C) mRNA expression. Results are expressed as mean ± SD, n = 6 mice per
  group per experiment, and are representative of two independent experiments. * p
  < 0.05 vs. control (C) group; # p < 0.05 vs. vehicle (V) treated group; one ANOVA
  followed by Tukey’s post hoc test.'
