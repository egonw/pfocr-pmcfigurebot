caption: miRNA-320 suppresses IL-6R/STAT3 expression in CAC colonic tissues and cells.
  (A) Expression of IL-6R, STAT3, and p-STAT3 proteins in colon tissue was analyzed
  by Western blot. The same column was GAPDH as an internal control. (B) mRNA levels
  of IL-6R and STAT3 in colon tissue were evaluated by qPCR. (C,D) The protein expression
  levels of IL-6R, STAT3, and p-STAT3 were analyzed by Western blot in HT29 and SW480
  cells transfected with LV-miRNA-320 or control (C) and HCT116 and DLD1 cells transfected
  with LV-anti-miRNA-320 or control (D). The same column was GAPDH as an internal
  control. (E,F) mRNA levels of IL-6R and STAT3 were evaluated by qPCR in HT29 and
  SW480 cells (E) and HCT116 and DLD1 cells (F). Data are expressed as the mean Â±
  SD. **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.001. CAC, colitis-associated colorectal cancer; miRNA,
  microRNA; IL-6R, interleukin-6 receptor; LV, lentiviral vector; STAT3, signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3; qPCR, quantitative real-time polymerase chain
  reaction; p-STAT3, phosphorylated-signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3; mRNA, messenger RNA; GAPDH, glyseraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; SD, standard
  deviation.
