caption: Sensitization with HDM allergen activates IL-13 signaling pathways and eotaxin
  levels and induces eosinophils' influx into the lung. Experimental design scheme
  for a murine asthma model driven by HDM allergen intranasal senstitization, and
  HDM allergen–specific IgE levels in naive mice (n = 9) versus in HDM-allergic mice
  (n = 9) on day 20, which was 2 days after the fifth and last sensitization (A).
  Heatmap with the differentially expressed genes, normalized by their z score, in
  lungs from naive mice and allergic animals, highlighting their distinct transcriptional
  signature (B). Significant (P < .05) upregulated and downregulated genes, with the
  log2 fold change threshold of greater than –1 or greater than 1, in the lungs of
  HDM-sensitized mice over those in lungs from naive mice obtained from a nanostring
  analysis of 507 genes associated with inflammation (C). TH2 cell pathway–associated
  genes that overlap with the marked differentially expressed genes in the lungs from
  HDM-sensitized mice over those in the lungs obtained from naive mice (D and E).
  Pulmonary tissue levels of IL-5 (F), IL-13 (G), IL-13 bound to IL-13Ra2 (H), CCL-11
  (K), CCL-24 (L), and CCL-2 (M) in the lung homogenates obtained from naive BALB/c
  mice and from BALB/c mice with HDM-allergic inflammation (n = 9 mice per group).
  Representative flow cytometry dot plot of lung cells (n = 5 in each group) stimulated
  with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)/ionomycin for 3 hours, gated on CD44+CD154+TCR-β+CD4+
  T cells, showing the frequencies of IL-13 and IFN-γ, followed by the frequency of
  IL-13–producing effector memory CD4+ T cells (I). Representative flow cytometry
  dot plots of the lungs, gated on CD45+Ly6G–, showing the frequencies of Siglec F–positive
  CD11c– eosinophils (J) and a representative flow cytometry dot plot of the lungs
  showing the frequencies of CD11b+F4/80+ macrophages expressing Ly6C and/or MHC-II
  (N). Absolute number of different clusters of macrophages in lungs from naive mice
  and lungs from HDM-sensitized mice (O). Each symbol represents a single mouse, and
  horizontal bars are geometric means. P values are indicated on each graph. Two independent
  experiments were performed. Differences between the naive and HDM groups were considered
  statistically significant at P values less than .05 obtained by the unpaired Mann-Whitney
  test. D, generated by QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software.
