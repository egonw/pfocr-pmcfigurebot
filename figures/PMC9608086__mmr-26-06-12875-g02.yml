caption: LPS-induced LCN2 is dependent on NF-κB activation in macrophages. (A) After
  stimulation with 50 ng/ml LPS for the indicated time, cytosolic and nuclear extracts
  of RAW264.7 cells were prepared and used to determine activation of the NF-ĸB pathway.
  Actin and lamin B were used as loading controls. (B) Cells were pretreated with
  PT and BAY 11-7082 (NF-κB-specific inhibitor), and the cells were stimulated with
  LPS for 24 h. Then, the levels of LCN2 mRNA and protein were detected using RT-PCR
  (upper panel) and western blot analysis (lower panel). GAPDH was used as a loading
  control. LPS, lipopolysaccharide; LCN2, lipocalin 2; PT, parthenolide; RT-PCR, reverse
  transcription-PCR; IκB-α, NF-kappa-B inhibitor α.
article_title: Lipocalin 2 activates the NLRP3 inflammasome via LPS-induced NF-κB
  signaling and plays a role as a pro-inflammatory regulator in murine macrophages.
