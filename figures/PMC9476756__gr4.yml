caption: Three T-CMs induced apoptosis in HepG2 (A, B) andBel7402 (C, D) cells. A,
  HepG2 cells were treated with three T-CMs at concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mg/mL
  for 48 h. The treatment group with 0.0 mg/mL reagents was used as the control group
  (CG), and 10 μmol/L Pt was used as the positive drug group (PG). Apoptosis assays
  were then performed and the cells were detected by flow cytometry. B, GraphPad Prism
  7.0 software was used to count the apoptotic rates shown in A. C, Bel7402 cells
  were treated with three T-CMs at concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mg/mL for 48 h.
  Apoptosis assays were then performed and the cells were detected by flow cytometry.
  D, GraphPad Prism 7.0 software was used to count the apoptotic rates shown in C.
  Each result was expressed by Mean ± SD with four replicates and the lower case letters
  indicated P < 0.05.
