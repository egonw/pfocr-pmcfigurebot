caption: Overview of distinct activated pathways upon BF treatment in cortical brain
  organoids. (a) Venn diagrams show the uniquely and differentially expressed genes
  upon bilirubin treatment for UM51 and i705-C2 cell lines for both the 24 h and 72
  h time points. Dot plots from KEGG-associated pathways and corresponding genes revealed
  cytokine–cytokine receptor activation in the patient line at 24 h post-treatment
  and (b), which goes down gradually at 72 h (c). This cytokine–cytokine receptor
  activation was not observed in the UM51 line at 24 h () but observed at 72 h (d).
  Dot plots show the activation of calcium signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway,
  and neuroactive ligand–receptor interaction for both cell lines at 72 h post-BF
  exposure.
