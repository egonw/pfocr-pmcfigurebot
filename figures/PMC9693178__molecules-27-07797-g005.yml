caption: 'Inhibition of TAP1 expression (pathway inhibition) by germacrone, a lead
  antiviral essential oil compound against the influenza A (H1N1) virus, and its replication:
  a mechanism of action. Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B
  cells (NF-κB), interferons (IFNs), and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) regulate
  many aspects of innate and adaptive immune responses, including driving anti-viral
  responses. Interferon stimulating genes (ISGs) are critical effectors of IFN response
  to viral infection. Transcription factor (AP-1) regulates the inflammatory gene
  expression in response to viral infections. The transporter associated with antigen
  processing 1 (TAP1), transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), and
  TAK1 binding protein (TAB) are also involved. The illustration was adapted from
