caption: Estimate of the individual expression of crtZ gene for astaxanthin content
  enhancement in transfected HEK293T cells with Î²-carotene and astaxanthin biosynthetic
  genes. (A) Expression of EGFP and mCherry in HEK293T cells transfected with pPYLG
  + pWZG-P2A + pcrtZ-R constructs supplied with GGPP. (B) HPLC analysis of cells transfected
  with above-mentioned plasmids and supplied with GGPP. Can, canthaxanthin; Ast, astaxanthin;
  E, trans geometric isomer; and Z, cis geometric isomer. (C) Total ketocarotenoid
  concentration compared with the ratio of astaxanthin content. DW, dry weight. (D)
  Astaxanthin and canthaxanthin concentration graphs from cell extracts transfected
  with pPYLG + pWZG-P2A + pcrtZ-R plasmids and supplied with GGPP. (E) HEK293T cell
  pellets with a red color indicate the accumulation of astaxanthin. (F) Pie charts
  show total ketocarotenoids with different percentages of astaxanthin and canthaxanthin
  content.
