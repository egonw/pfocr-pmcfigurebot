caption: Enrichment analysis of differential metabolites on KEGG metabolic pathway
  in Nipponbare. (A) KEGG classification map of differential metabolites. The ordinate
  is the name of KEGG metabolic pathway, and the abscissa is the number of metabolites
  annotated to one pathway and their proportion to the total number of metabolites
  annotated; (B) KEGG enrichment map of differential metabolites. The abscissa represents
  the Rich factor corresponding to each pathway, the ordinate represents the pathway
  name, and the point with different color is p-value.
