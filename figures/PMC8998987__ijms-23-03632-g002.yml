caption: Oncogenic pathway analysis of the Stomach Adenoma (STAD) project of the TCGA
  biobank. Data were retrieved from the TCGA biobank using the “TCGAbiolinks” package;
  analysis was performed with the “maftools” package with the function “OncogenicPathways”.
  The pathways were ranked based on the frequency with which their member genes were
  found mutated in the cohort. The left part (blue bars) of the graphic represents
  the percentage of patients in which at least one of the genes belonging to the pathway
  has been found mutated. The right part (red bars) represents the percentage of genes
  listed in the pathway that were found mutated.
