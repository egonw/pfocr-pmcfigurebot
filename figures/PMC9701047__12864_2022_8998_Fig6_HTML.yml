caption: Heatmap diagram showing the DEGs involved in carbon metabolism (associated
  with energy production) in JXZ and MXXZ under control and high humidity conditions.
  The glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway connected by black straight arrow lines and
  citrate cycle (TCA cycle) pathway shown by the loop diagram. DEGs were analysed
  in two comparisons, JXZ-T vs. JXZ-C (JXZ) and MXXZ-T vs. MXXZ-C (MXXZ). "JXZ-C,"
  "JXZ-T," "MXXZ-C," and "MXXZ-T" indicate the control (C) and PHS-induced (T) samples
  of the JXZ and MXXZ varieties, respectively. The colour gradient shows the relative
  expression levels of DEGs from low (blue indicates downregulation) to high (red
  indicates upregulation). The numerical values of the blue-to-red gradient bar represent
  the log2 fold change in expression for the high humidity treatment relative to the
  control
