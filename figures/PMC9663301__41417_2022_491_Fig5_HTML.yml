figure_title: Effects of small molecule inhibitors on the phosphorylation status of
  key PI3K/AKT/MTOR pathway proteins
caption: Effects of (A) torin-1, (B) capivasertib (C) everolimus and (D) combination
  of torin-1 with capivasertib on p-MTOR Ser2448 and p-AKT Ser473 phosphorylation
  status in RCH-ACV cells after 15 min treatment. One representative graph is shown.
  Fold median fluorescence intensity (MFI) change of cells treated with inhibitor
  compared to vehicle. Data represent mean + SEM of three independent experiments.
  Statistical analysis was performed by Mann–Whitney U test. E Western blots using
  anti-p-MTOR Ser 2448 and anti-p-AKT Ser473 antibodies after the treatment with DMSO
  (vehicle), Capiv. (capivasertib) 200 nM, torin-1 5 nM and the combination capivasertib
  200 nM and torin-1 5 nM. Anti-AKT and anti-MTOR antibodies were used as loading
  controls. A representative from three experiments is shown. Densitometry values
  were calculated using ImageJ software.
