caption: 'DCC overexpression reverses the promoting effect of the miR-182/183 cluster
  on the progression of SZ: (a) expression of miR-182 and miR-183 in the hippocampal
  tissues of SZ rats with AgomiR-182/183+oe-DCC determined by RT-qPCR along with Western
  blot analysis of DCC protein in the hippocampal tissues of SZ rats with AgomiR-182/183+oe-DCC
  (n = 8/group); (b) open field test (left), PPI test (middle), and Morris water maze
  test (right) in SZ rats (n = 8/group); (c) apoptosis in hippocampal neurons in response
  to AgomiR-182/183+oe-DCC. The data in the figure were measurement data, expressed
  as the mean ± standard deviation, and analyzed by an independent sample t-test.
  ∗p < 0.05vs. the AgomiR-182/183+oe-NC or miR-182/183 mimic+oe-NC group. The cell
  experiments were repeated three times independently.'
