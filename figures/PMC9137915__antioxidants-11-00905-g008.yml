caption: 'SZ-A regulates the AMPK signaling pathway in HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells were
  treated with PA (0.125 mmol/L) and/or SZ-A (12.5, 25, or 50 μg/mL), DNJ (40 μg/mL),
  FA (10 μg/mL), and DAB (10 μg/mL) for 24 h. Glucose consumption (A) and glycogen
  content (B) of each group was measured. (C,D) Levels of TGs in primary hepatocytes
  in the indicated groups. (E) Protein expression levels of p-AMPK, AMPK, p-ACC, ACC,
  and β-actin in HepG2 cells were analyzed by Western blot. β-Actin was used as an
  internal reference. Data are shown as the mean ± SEM (n = 4/group). # p < 0.05,
  ## p < 0.01 compared with cells treated with medium only, and * p < 0.05, ** p <
  0.01 vs. cells treated with PA. TG, triglyceride; SZ-A, Ramulus Mori (Sangzhi) alkaloids;
  DNJ, 1-deoxynojirimycin; DAB, 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-arabinitol; FA, fagomine;
  BSA, bovine serum albumin; PA, palmitic acid; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase;
  ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; p-AMPK, phospho-AMP-activated protein kinase; p-ACC,
  phospho-acetyl-CoA carboxylase.'
