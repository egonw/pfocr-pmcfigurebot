caption: (A) Treemap chart illustrating significant GO-BP terms associated with DEIRGs.
  Each rectangular shape represents individual terms and their sizes vary according
  to the number of genes present in them. All the rectangles have a unique color signifying
  the distinct  BP terms. The term “cell chemotaxis” has the highest number of genes
  present in it, i.e., . While the terms “neutrophil chemotaxis” and “positive regulation
  of endothelial cell proliferation” has the lowest number of genes present in it,
  i.e., . (B) Lollipop plot showing the distribution of significant GO-MF terms associated
  with DEIRGs. The  and  axes represents the MF terms and gene count. The term “signaling
  receptor activator activity” has highest number of genes present in it, i.e., .
  The term “protein tyrosine kinase activator activity” has lowest number of genes
  present in it, i.e., . (C) Circos plot representing significant GO-CC terms associated
  with DEIRGs. Outer boundary of the circle consists of  CC terms (on the left) linked
  with the DEIRGs present in them (on the right). Each gene and pathway are denoted
  by unique color strips with an undirected edge showing the corresponding associations.
  (D) Circular barplot showing the distribution of  significant pathways associated
  with DEIRGs. The color and sizes of bars depend on the  and gene count, respectively.
