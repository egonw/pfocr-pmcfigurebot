figure_title: Significantly enriched pathways after infection by EV-D94 or EV-D68
  in respiratory and intestinal tissues
caption: A). Genes with average log2 fold change increase/decrease of 0.5 versus the
  mock were considered for pathway analysis. Pathway with p-value < 0.00001 were classified
  as enriched. Yellow bars represent upregulated pathways while purple bars represent
  downregulated ones. Bar size illustrates p-value. 1* Cell-Cell communication; 2*
  Cellular responses to external stimuli; 3* Developmental biology; 4* DNA repair;
  5* Extracellular matrix organization; 6* Gene expression (Transcription); 7* Hemostasis;
  8* Metabolism; 9* Organelle biogenesis and maintenance; 10* Signal transduction.
  Functional annotations were obtained from reactome.org. B) Heatmap of selected immune
  genes. The FC values for each transcript are represented in . Images depicting intestinal
  and respiratory tissue sections were obtained from Mattek and from []. Another representation
  of these data is available in  and at [http://genebrowser.unige.ch/enterovirus/].
