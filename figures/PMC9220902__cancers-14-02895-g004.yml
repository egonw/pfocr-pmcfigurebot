caption: 'Carboplatin drug response in OvCa PDM correlates with the activity of diverse
  signaling pathways. (A) Heat map of protein abundances (calculated from median-centered
  NFI values) averaged over carboplatin-responder (R) and non-responder (Non-R) OvCa
  PDM. Carboplatin responders and non-responders were grouped according to significant
  treatment effects from functional compound testing (C). Only proteins with >20%
  increased or decreased abundance between responder and non-responder group were
  selected. Data was HCL clustered with Euclidean distance (average linkage). (B)
  Signaling pathway activation in carboplatin-responder vs. non-responder OvCa PDM.
  Proteins were sorted according to their pathway affiliation and according to upregulation
  or downregulation within responder group. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001,
  Mann–Whitney-U-test. (C) Proteomic on- and off-target pathway effects in carboplatin-treated
  (75 µM) OvCa #24 PDM analyzed by RPPA. Treated PDM were analyzed from an immediate
  (0.5 h), an early (4 h) and a late (72 h) treatment time. For each time point, protein
  values are displayed as log2-transformed treatment-to-control signal ratios (TR)
  calculated from NFI signals of treated PDM and corresponding vehicle control (DMSO).
  Only proteins with >50% differential protein abundance compared to vehicle control
  were selected. Straight lines above plots indicate statistical significances compared
  to vehicle control. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, One-way ANOVA using
  nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis with Dunn’s ad hoc test.'
