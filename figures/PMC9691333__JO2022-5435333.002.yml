caption: Circ_0004488 knockdown decreases cervical cancer cell invasion, sphere formation,
  and paclitaxel resistance. (a-b) Analysis of circ_0004488 by qRT-PCRs in (a) SiHa
  cells transfected with circ_0004488 siRNA or control siRNA and (b) HeLa cells transfected
  with the circ_0004488 vector or control vector. (b-e) After circ_0004488 was knocked
  down or overexpressed, CCK-8, sphere formation, transwell invasion, and cell viability
  tests were used to evaluate cervical cell proliferation (b), sphere formation (c),
  invasion (d), and cell viability (e). ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
