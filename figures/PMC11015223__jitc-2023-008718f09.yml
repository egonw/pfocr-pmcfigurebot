caption: Mechanism diagram. In GBM, the expression of OMA1 was increased, which inhibited
  the formation of IP3R/HSPA9/VDAC1 complex by competitively binding with IP3R to
  HSPA9, resulting in the blockage of mitochondrial TCA cycle. The impaired mitochondrial
  function will promote mitophagy, thereby increasing the release of mitochondrial
  DNA, activating the cGAS–STING signaling pathway, and promoting the expression of
  PD-L1. PD-L1 is recognized by PD-1 of CD8+ T cells and plays a role in immune escape.
  GBM, glioblastoma; PD-L1, programmed death receptor 1 ligand.
