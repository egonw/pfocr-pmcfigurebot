caption: The Leloir pathway of galactose metabolism and proposed mechanism of myo-inositol
  (MI) and purple sweet potato color (PSPC) support in Classic Galactosemia. With
  the deficiency of GALT, galactose-1 phosphate and galactitol are present with a
  deficiency of UDP-galactose. This contributes to a dysregulated Integrated Stress
  Response (ISR), cellular stress, and DNA damage. PSPC has the potential to relieve
  cellular distress by bolstering the antioxidant defense, scavenging free radicals,
  reducing ER stress, and thus supporting the ISR; additional anti-inflammatory and
  antioxidant pathways are likely involved. Supplemental MI may ameliorate cellular
  distress by restoring levels of inositol and reducing ER stress. Supplementation
  of either may improve the sequelae of Classic Galactosemia. Solid arrows and inhibitor
  lines represent known metabolic processes; dashed red lines represent potentially
  inhibited metabolic processes; small solid red arrows indicate the increases or
  decreases of selected metabolites in the pathway. Finally, question marks with dashed
  lines indicate that the mechanism of the two selected supplement’s impacts on the
  ISR are unknown. This figure was created in BioRender.com.
