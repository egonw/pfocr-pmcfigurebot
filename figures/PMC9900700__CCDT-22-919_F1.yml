caption: The expression of BCL11A in different human cancers. (A) BCL11A expression
  levels in different tumor types from the TCGA database were detected by TIMER. Compared
  with normal tissues, the expression level of BCL11A was higher in cholangiocarcinoma,
  colon adenocarcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, lung cancer and kidney cancer. *P <
  0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 vs. normal tissues. (B) In 4 datasets, high expression
  of BCL11A was a risk factor for overall or disease‐free survival in patients with
  shorter OS or disease‐free survival (DFS) by PrognoScan database. (C) Compared to
  other cancers, high expression levels of BCL11A were observed in NB cell lines and
  primary tumors. BCL11A was highly expressed during embryogenesis.
