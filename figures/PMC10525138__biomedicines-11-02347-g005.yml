caption: 'Intracellular cAMP level increases by the D1-like, IP, and 5-HT4 receptor
  agonists, which were suppressed by adenylyl cyclase inhibition. (A,C,E) Representative
  traces of transient intracellular cAMP level increases in response to 500 nM SKF83959
  (A), 10 nM beraprost (C), and 50 nM BIMU8 (E) with or without 0.1 µM SQ22536 in
  the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (2.5 mM). Black boxes indicate time periods of
  application for SKF83959 (A), beraprost (C), and BIMU8 (E) to the external solution.
  White boxes denote the time of addition of SQ22536 to the external solution. (B,D,F)
  Summary bar graphs of SKF83959- (B), beraprost- (D), and BIMU8- (F) induced intracellular
  cAMP level increases, without (upper columns) or with (middle columns) 0.1 µM SQ22536
  in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. Each recovery (lower columns) indicates that
  SQ22536 acts reversibly. Each bar denotes mean ± S.E. of eight (B), seven (D), and
  six (F) experiments. Asterisk: * p < 0.05 shows statistically significant differences
  between columns (indicated by a solid line).'
