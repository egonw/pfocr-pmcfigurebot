caption: 'PPI limited the self-renewal ability of LCSCs. (a) Enrichment of LCSCs derived
  from HepG2 and Huh-7 cells using a serum-free suspension culture and morphological
  comparison of HCC cells and LCSCs. (b) A tumor sphere formation assay was carried
  out to test the inhibitory effect of PPI on the self-renewal ability of LCSCs. ∗P
  < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01vs. the control group; #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01vs. the Sora
  group.'
