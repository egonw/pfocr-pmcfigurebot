caption: Greengage polyphenols and related metabolic pathways(A) Composition of the
  polyphenols of greengages; (B) Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway
  analysis of greengage polyphenols. The ordinate is the pathway name, and the abscissa
  indicates the impact corresponding to each pathway. The colour of the bubble represents
  the p-value. The size of the bubble represents the number of substances enriched.
  The deeper the red colour, the more significant the enrichment. . (For interpretation
  of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
  Web version of this article.)
