caption: Analysis of immune-related pathway. (A) Heatmap depicting immune-related
  pathway of all mutated genes in group 1. There were 15 kinds of immune-related pathway
  among these genes that were mutated in group 1. (B) Heatmap showing immune-related
  pathway of all mutated genes in group 2. These mutated genes were involved in 17
  categories of immune-related pathway.
