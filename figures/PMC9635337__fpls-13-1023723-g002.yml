caption: (A) Expression of indole-3-acetic acid by (B) cereus and an ipdc mutant.
  (B) Confocal micrographs showing propidium iodide staining of the cell wall of wild-type
  and osaux1-3 mutant from the lateral root tips of Oryza sativa. L. Micrographic
  representation of cell size of the wild-type (above row) and osaux1-3 mutant (below
  row). Arrow indicates the RHS development. Right, the bright field with a scale
  bar of 50 µm. (C, D) Phenotypic comparison between wild-type (Dongjin), mutant lines
  Osaux1-3, and IPDC transgenic line after 3 to 7 days of germination. Scale bar,
  1 cm. (E) Relative expression of IPDC transgenic lines in root and shoot. Scale
  bar, 1 cm. (F) osaux1-3 inoculated and noninoculated with (B) cereus expression
  in 10-day-old seedlings treated with 200 µM CdCl2; DR5:GUS was transformed into
  the rice. Ten positive transgenic lines were observed. ProDR5:GUS activity is shown
  in (F). Lowercase letters indicate significant differences between means, determined
  using Duncan’s multiple range mean comparisons.
article_title: Indole pyruvate decarboxylase gene regulates the auxin synthesis pathway
  in rice by interacting with the indole-3-acetic acid–amido synthetase gene, promoting
  root hair development under cadmium stress.
