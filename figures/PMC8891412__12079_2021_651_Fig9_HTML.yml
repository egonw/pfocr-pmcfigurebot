caption: SOS1-IT1 is upregulated under hypoxia and directly transactivated by HIF-1α.
  a The Ishikawa cells were treated with hypoxia or its chemical inducer CoCl2 for
  24 h, and the expression level of SOS1-IT1 was detected by real-time PCR. b–c HIF-1α
  was knocked down by two different HIF-1α small interfering RNA (siRNA), and the
  expression level was analyzed by western blot (b). The expression level of SOS1-IT1
  was analyzed after knocking down HIF-1α, both in normoxia and hypoxia condition
  (c). d Schematic illustration of the putative HIF-1α binding site in SOS1-IT1 gene
  promoter. e The dual-luciferase reporter assays were performed in Ishikawa cells
  transfected with different reporter constructs, both in normoxia and hypoxia condition.
  f The ChIP assays were performed using control IgG or anti-HIF-1α antibody in Ishikawa
  cells. The binding of HIF-1α on SOS1-IT1 promoter was analyzed by real-time PCR.
  G The dual-luciferase reporter assays were performed in Ishikawa cells when knocking
  down HIF-1α with two different siRNAs. h The cell growth was performed by WST-1
  assays after SOS1-IT1 knocked down in normoxia or hypoxia condition. i The Ishikawa
  cells were overexpressed with flag tagged HIF-1α, and the expression of HIF-1α protein
  was verified by western blot. The flag tagged HIF-1α followed was detected by immunoblotting
  with an anti-flag antibody, and the actin protein act as internal reference. j The
  cell growth was performed by WST-1 assays after HIF-1α overexpression with SOS1-IT1
  knocked down. ** P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001
