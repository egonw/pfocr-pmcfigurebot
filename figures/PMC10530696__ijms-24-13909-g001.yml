caption: 'Regulation of Wnt/β-catenin Signaling Pathway by ncRNAs: Insights into Activation
  and Suppression Mechanisms (By Figdraw). “Activation State”: when Wnt binds to drizzled
  and LRP receptors, cytoplasmic protein DVL is activated, leading to the inhibition
  of GSK3β. Subsequently, stabilized β-catenin translocates into the nucleus and interacts
  with TCF/LEF transcription factors, resulting in target gene transcription. In this
  activation mechanism, specific ncRNAs, such as miR-34a and miR-27a, play pivotal
  roles. They interact with the promoter region of Wnt genes, promoting the transcription
  and expression of Wnt proteins, thus enhancing Wnt protein levels. Additionally,
  they interact with negative regulators in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, such
  as Axin and GSK-3β, reducing their degradation effect on β-catenin. Furthermore,
  ncRNAs like circHIPK3 also modulate key genes in the pathway, decreasing their degradation
  effect on β-catenin and promoting the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway, thereby enhancing its activity. “Suppression State”: in the absence of
  WNT ligands, the destruction complex of β-catenin consists of AXIN, CK1α, GSK3β,
  and APC, which phosphorylate β-catenin for subsequent ubiquitin–proteasome degradation.
  In the suppression mechanism, certain ncRNAs, such as miR-425-5p and circ_0026628,
  play essential roles. They interact with negative regulators in the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway, such as Axin and GSK-3β, and enhance their degradation effect
  on β-catenin. This leads to increased degradation of β-catenin, resulting in the
  inhibition of signaling pathway activity. Moreover, ncRNAs like circ_0026628 can
  also interact with regulatory factors associated with downstream genes in the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway, inhibiting their transcriptional activity and reducing the transcription
  levels of downstream genes. These interactions further enhance the degradation of
  β-catenin, ultimately influencing the activity state of the signaling pathway. ncRNAs
  highlighted in red font signify the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, whereas
  those in blue font represent inhibition of the Wnt signaling pathway.'
