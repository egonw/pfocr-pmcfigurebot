figure_title: TFEB/TFE3 signaling in ESCRT-I–deficient cells is activated due to the
  inhibition of the Rag GTPase–dependent mTORC1 pathway
caption: '(A) Western blots showing levels of phosphorylation of TFEB at Ser122 and
  the indicated canonical mTORC1 targets in cells lacking ESCRT-I (transfected with
  siTsg101#2 or siVps28#1) as compared with control cells (siCtrl#1 or #2, nontargeting
  siRNAs) at 48 h post transfection (48 hpt) upon culture in regular medium (EMEM)
  or nutrient-deficient medium (EBSS) for 2 h. Vinculin was used as a loading control.
  (A, B) Graphs showing fold levels of indicated phosphorylations measured by densitometry
  analysis of Western blotting bands, including those shown in (A). Values derived
  from independent experiments (dots) and their means (n = 4 ± SEM) are presented.
  Statistical significance tested by comparison to siCtrl#1. ns, nonsignificant, *P
  < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. (C) Single-plane confocal images of fixed RKO
  cells at 48 hpt showing intracellular distribution of TFEB (green) with respect
  to LAMP1 protein (red) or DAPI-stained nuclei (blue) in ESCRT-I–depleted (siTsg101#2)
  or control (siCtrl#1) cells upon 2 h treatment with vehicle (Vh, DMSO) or 1 μM INK128.
  Scale bar, 100 μm. (D, E) Dot plots showing the percentage of cells with nuclear
  TFEB localization (D) or TFEB colocalization with LAMP1-positive structures (E)
  in ESCRT-I–depleted (siTsg101#2) or control (siCtrl#1) cells. Values derived from
  independent experiments (dots) and their means (n = 4 ± SEM) are presented. ns—nonsignificant,
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001. (F) Single-plane confocal images of fixed
  RKO cells at 48 hpt showing intracellular distribution of TFEB or TFE3 (green) with
  respect to DAPI-stained nuclei (blue) in control or ESCRT-I–depleted cells expressing
  or not wild-type (WT) or constitutively active (S75L) HA-GST-RagC protein (red).
  Scale bar, 20 μm. Dot plots on the right showing the percentage of cells with nuclear
  TFEB or TFE3 localization. Values derived from independent experiments (dots) and
  their means (n = 3 ± SEM) are presented. Statistical significance tested by comparison
  to siCtrl#1 conditions. ns—nonsignificant (P ≥ 0.05), *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. (G)
  Western blots showing levels of phosphorylation of the indicated proteins as well
  as total levels of TFEB, Tsg101, and HA-GST-RagC in ESCRT-I–depleted (siTsg101#2)
  or control (siCtrl#1) cells at 48 hpt with ectopic expression of the HA-GST-RagC
  protein (WT or S75L). Vinculin was used as a loading control. The bottom graph shows
  phosphorylation levels of Ser122 of TFEB measured by densitometry analysis of Western
  blotting bands, including those shown above. Values derived from independent experiments
  (dots) and their means (n = 3 ± SEM) are presented. Statistical significance tested
  by comparison to siCtrl#1. ns, nonsignificant, *P < 0.05.'
