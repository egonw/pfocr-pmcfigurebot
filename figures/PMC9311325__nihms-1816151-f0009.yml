caption: Activation of the DNA Damage Response (DDR) pathway. (A) Immunofluorescence
  panels showing expression of phospho-H2AFX, a marker for the double-stranded DNA
  breaks (DSBs) in the myocardial sections. (B) Quantitative data showing the percentage
  of nuclei staining positive for the expression of pH2AFX. (C) Immunofluorescence
  panels showing expression of phospho-H2AFX in isolated cardiac fibroblasts. Panels
  representing the expression of pH2AFX (green color), PDGFRA (red), and the overlay
  are presented along with enlarged inserts showing the expression of pH2AFX in the
  nuclei of isolated cardiac fibroblasts. (D) Graph depicting the percentage of the
  cells co-expressing PDGFRA and pH2AFX in the experimental and control groups. (E)
  Immunoblots showing expression of selected proteins involved in the DDR pathways,
  namely pH2AFX, total H2AFX, ATN, and CGAS, along with blot representing controls
  for the loading conditions, are shown in the WT, Pdgfra-Cre, Pdgfra-Cre:LmnaW/F,
  and Pdgfra-Cre:LmnaW/F mice. (F) Quantitative data corresponding to the blots shown
  in panel C.
