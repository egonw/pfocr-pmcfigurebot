caption: Illustrative diagram showing the protective function of rapamycin on CTX-induced
  ovarian reserve injury. CTX exposure causes loss of primordial follicles and apoptosis
  in developing follicles via activation of the mTOR signaling pathway. Rapamycin
  intervention alleviates the overactivation of the mTOR signaling pathway, thereby
  protecting the primordial follicle pool and reducing apoptosis of developing follicles.
  CTX, cyclophosphamide.

  reserve against cyclophosphamide-induced damage.
