figure_title: Schematic representation of exosome secretion and its effects after
  radiation exposure. Following radiation exposure, cancer cells exhibit an enhanced
  formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs), leading to increased exosome secretion.
  These exosomes promote intercellular communication between cancer cells, resulting
  in cell proliferation and radioresistance. Images were obtained using BioRender.com
