caption: 'Functional genomic pathways enriched in the WTC-exposed (WTC EHC) breast
  cancer cases vs. WTC-exposed cancer-free women. Legend: Summary of pathway network
  analysis highlights the relationship between probe sets enriched in the WTC-exposed
  women compared to unexposed women. Y-axis shows the probe sets with significant
  overlap with the reference probe sets/genes from the KEGG database. X-axis shows
  the ratio of the number of differentially expressed probe sets/genes to the total
  number of genes included in the particular pathway gene set from the reference KEGG
  pathway database. The dot sizes are proportional to the number of overlapping probe
  sets/genes. The dot colors show the p-value adjusted for false discovery rate.'
