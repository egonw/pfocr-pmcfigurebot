figure_title: The significance of genomic mutations in the two immune subtypes of
  OCCC
caption: a Selected significantly mutated genes (SMGs) in OCCC samples. The upper
  plot shows the frequency of mutation for each tumour sample. The central plot shows
  the types of mutations in each tumour sample (when the sample showed more than one
  mutation in the same gene, only the most deleterious type is shown). The lower part
  of the figure shows the response to platinum therapy, tumour stage and immune status
  of each sample. b Tumour mutation burden (TMB) distributions between the two groups.
  P value was based on Wilcox test. The middle line in the box is the median, the
  bottom and top of the box are the first and third quartiles, and the whiskers extend
  to 1.5× interquartile range of the lower and the upper quartiles, respectively.
  c Enrichment of PI3K-AKT pathway. OCCC = ovarian clear cell carcinoma.
