caption: Changes in the transcript abundance of genes involved in central metabolic
  pathways, fatty acid biosynthesis, and the PKSâ€“NRPS pathway. Key enzymes with logFC
  values are included in the map with their names written out. Red represents up-
  and green represents downregulation. G6PD glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6PGD
  6-glucose*phosphate dehydrogenase, IDH isocitric dehydrogenase, PDH pyruvate dehydrogenase,
  CS citrate-synthase, fadD acyl-CoA synthetase, FAS1 Fatty acid synthase fas1, ELO2
  fatty acid elongase 2, PKS polyketide synthase, NRPS nonribosomal peptide synthetase,
  LPIN Lipid phosphate phosphohydrolase
