caption: IL-8 secretion levels after 5 h of incubation (3 h + IL-1β) determined via
  the Bio-Plex Luminex Assay. Protein secretion levels were determined quantitatively
  and normalized to the stimulus control. For significant differences compared to
  the IL-1β control, the Student’s t-test was applied for p < 0.01 ** and p < 0.001
  ***. Incubation conditions include B[a]P 1 μM, CH-22 1 μM, AOH 10 μM, ATX-II 1 μM,
  and binary mixture AOH/ATX-II (10:1) (combi).
