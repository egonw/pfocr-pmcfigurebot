caption: Enrichment analysis of YY1 related genes. (a) Using the STRING tool, we first
  gathered experimentally determined YY1-binding proteins. (b) The top 100 YY1 associated
  genes in the TCGA project were obtained using the GEPIA2 method, and the expression
  association between YY1 and SP3, SMEK1, CPSF2, PPP2R5E, PAPOLA, MARCH7, and other
  selected target genes was analyzed. (c) Display the corresponding heat map data
  for detailed cancer types. (d) YY1-binding and related genes were cross-analyzed.
  (e) YY1 binding and interaction genes were used to create a KEGG pathway analysis.
  (f) YY1 binding and interaction genes were used to create a GO enrichment analysis.

  with Clinical Outcome, Tumor Microenvironment, and Therapeutic Targets.
