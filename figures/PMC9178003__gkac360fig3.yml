caption: Over-expression of HK2 alters the abundance of a subset of proteins involved
  in the AHR network. (A) Schema of the protocol used to characterise U2OS and U2OS-GFP-HK2
  proteomes. Four samples of each cell lines were analysed by mass spectrometry. (B)
  Mean of label free quantification (LFQ) values of proteins annotated by Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis (IPA) software as belonging to the ‘AHR signalling pathway’ and
  identified in the proteomic approach with significant changes in abundance between
  U2OS and U2OS-GFP-HK2 cells (n = 4). Targets are grouped in four classes according
  to their abundance levels in U2OS and U2OS-GFP-HK2 cells. (C) Western blot analysis
  of a subset of proteins identified in the proteomic analysis and belonging to the
  ‘AHR signalling pathway’. Relative quantifications between cell lines are indicated
  below the blots (relative to MCM2 levels which is not differentially expressed between
  U2OS and U2OS-GFP-HK2 cells according to the proteomic data). (D) Cytoscape visualization
  of proteins deregulated in U2OS-GFP-HK2 compared to U2OS cells and annotated as
  ‘AHR signalling pathway’ or ‘downstream targets’ (i.e targets of predicted Upstream
  Regulators) using the IPA software. Proteins are colour-coded with up-regulated
  proteins in U2OS-GFP-HK2 depicted in red and proteins down-regulated depicted in
  blue. Proteins annotated as ‘AHR signalling pathway’ are highlighted by bold lines.
  (E) Venn diagram showing the overlap between ‘AHR signalling pathway’ proteins and
  ‘downstream targets’. (F) Genes encoding proteins of the HK2/AHR network identified
  as AHR genomic targets in MCF-7, GM17212 and HepG2 cells (either in presence or
  absence of agonist). Blue indicates the presence of an AHR binding sites in the
  vicinity of the promoter and/or in the coding sequence of the gene.
