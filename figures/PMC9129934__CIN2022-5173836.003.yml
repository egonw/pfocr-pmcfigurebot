caption: 'Zizhu ointment treatment promotes M2 macrophage polarization. (a) The count
  of F4/80+ cells in different groups. (b) The M1/M2 ratio in different groups. (c)
  Relative expression of proinflammatory markers IL-6, MCP-1, iNOS, and TNF-α. (d)
  Relative expression levels of anti-inflammatory factors IL-4, CD206, ARG1, and IL-10.
  Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD); ∗p < 0.01 vs control group;
  #p < 0.05 vs diabetic ulcer group; ##p < 0.01 vs diabetic ulcer group.'
