figure_title: Inactivation of BMP-SMAD signaling promotes anti-androgen resistance
caption: (A) Top gene sets upregulated in enzalutamide-treated as compared with TP53-silenced
  LNCaP cells. Chemical and genetic perturbations (CGP) (3,368 gene sets) dataset
  from the MSigDB collection is shown. Enrichment was computed and ranked by p value.(B)
  Correlation between ssGSEA score of the HALLMARK_ANDROGEN_RESPONSE and LDN193189_RESPONSE
  in the FHCRC dataset.(C) Heatmap of average ssGSEA scores of the HALLMARK_ANDROGEN_RESPONSE,
  the LDN193189_RESPONSE, and the expression of representative AR target genes and
  genes suppressed or activated by BMP-SMAD signaling in LNCaP cells treated with
  10 μM enzalutamide for 0–14 days. Three replicates per condition are shown.(D) IB
  of BMP receptors and phosphorylation of BMP-responsive SMADs in LNCaP cells treated
  with enzalutamide for 0–4 days. Representative blots of n = 3 technical replicates
  are shown.(E and F) qPCR of mRNAs encoding BMP-SMAD pathway components (normalized
  to 18S) in LNCaP cells treated with 10 μM enzalutamide for 0, 7, and 14 days (E)
  or 100 pM R1881 for 1 and 2 days (F). p values were determined by two-way ANOVA;
  multiple comparisons test by Dunnett’s method is shown. Error bars represent the
  mean ± SD of triplicate experiments; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p
  < 0.0001.(G) Immunoblotting of AR, AR targets, and EMT/stemness markers in LNCaP
  cells treated with 100 nM LDN193189 for 0–10 days. Representative blots of n = 3
  technical replicates are shown.(H) qPCR of AR and KLK3 mRNAs in serum starved LNCaP
  cells treated with 50 nM LDN193189 or SMART pool NEO1 siRNA. Error bars represent
  the mean ± SD of triplicate experiments.(I–K) Schematic view of SMAD1/5 binding
  motifs in the AR promoter (I). Serum-starved LNCaP cells were treated for 8 h with
  100 ng/mL BMP4 or DMSO and subjected to ChIP with anti-P-SMAD1/5/8 antibody (J)
  or H3K4me3 antibody (K). Two distal sites in the AR promoter, both containing SMAD1/5
  motif (refer to I) and a negative control site in exon 2, were examined. Error bars
  represent the mean ± SD; n = 3 technical replicates.(L) qPCR of AR and KLK3 mRNA
  in LNCaP cells treated for 1 day with 100 ng/mL BMP4 or DMSO. Error bars represent
  mean ± SD; n = 3 technical replicates.(M and N) Cell growth of control and LDN193189
  pretreated (8 days) LNCaP cells in response to CSS + DHT (M) and control and LDN193189
  pretreated (8 days) LNCaP cells expressing the indicated control and TP53-targeted
  shRNAs in response to CSS + 10 μM enzalutamide (N). Error bars represent the mean
  ± SD; n = 3 technical replicates. p values by one-way ANOVA and multiple comparison
  by Dunnett’s test are shown; ****p < 0.0001.(O and P) Quantification (O) and representative
  images (P) of tumorspheres seeded by control and TP53-silenced LNCaP cells (day
  10). Cells were treated with or without 100 nM LDN193189 and LDN193189 + rhNRG1
  beginning 8 days before the assay. Error bars represent mean ± SD of triplicate
  experiments. p values were determined by two-way ANOVA; multiple comparisons test
  by Dunnett’s method is shown; ***p < 0.001; scale bar represents 500 μm.(Q) Model
  of the distinct transcriptional and signaling mechanisms governing acquisition of
  mesenchymal and stemness traits and anti-androgen resistance.
