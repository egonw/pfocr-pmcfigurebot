figure_title: The anatomy of the eye, cornea and corneal epithelium
caption: As the visual organ of the human body, the eye is a complex and sophisticated
  structure that consists of the cornea, lens, vitreous, choroid, retina, optic nerve,
  and other accessory structures from front to back. The cornea is situated at the
  front of the eye and is composed of the CE, Bowman’s layer, corneal stroma, Descemet’s
  membrane and the endothelium from outside to inside. Located at the outermost layer
  of the cornea, the CE is derived from the surface ectoderm. The CE is a self-renewing
  stratified nonkeratinized squamous epithelium that protects the inner eye tissue,
  forms the immune barrier, supports the tear film, and maintains transparency to
  play a role in transmitting light. CECs include superficial squamous cells, central
  suprabasal cells, and a single layer of inner columnar basal cells.
