caption: ARID1A mutation may interact with Treg and promote Type-I–IFN–Response pathway
  to facilitate tumor immune response in EC (endometrial cancer). (a) 71 DEGs (differentially
  expressed genes), 25 upregulated and 46 downregulated, between ARID1A mutant and
  wild group in UCEC (uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma) cohort. (b) KEGG and GO
  enrichment analysis of the 71 DEGs. (c-d) correlation between 25 upregulated genes/46
  downregulated genes and abundances of 26 immune cells, respectively. (e) Regulating
  network between immune pathways (purple), tumor infiltrating cells (red), and DEGs
  (green). (UCEC : The Cancer Genome Atlas-Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma cohort;
  FDR : False Discovery Rate; KEGG : Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; GO : Gene
  Ontology).
