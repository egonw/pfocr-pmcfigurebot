caption: The anti-IL-6 antibody reversed the effect of IL-6 on SW620 and SW480 cells.
  (A) CCK-8 assay showed the impact of IL-6 and anti-IL-6 antibodies on the proliferation
  rate of SW480 and SW620 cells. (B) Transwell assay showed the impact of IL-6 and
  anti-IL-6 antibodies on the migration and invasion capabilities of SW480 and SW620
  cells. Cells were stained with crystal violet. (C) Western blot analysis showing
  the impact of IL-6 and anti-IL-6 antibodies on the phosphorylation level of STAT3.
  *P<0.05. IL-6, interleukin 6; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3; CCK-8, Cell Counting Kit-8.
