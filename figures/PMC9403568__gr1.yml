caption: 'Hypoxia induces Triple-Negative Breast Cancer docetaxel resistance via miR-494.
  (A) Hypoxia significantly decreased the growth-inhibitory effect of docetaxel (DTX)
  by CCK-8 assay, (B) reduced apoptosis level of DTX by DNA fragmentation assays in
  Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) cells MB-231; (C) Hypoxia significantly decreased
  the growth-inhibitory effect of DTX (D) reduced apoptosis level of DTX in TNBC cells
  MB-468; (E) Protein levels of HIF-1α and cleaved Caspase 3 pathway were determined
  by Western blot. (F) The heatmap showed 20 differentially expressed miRNAs in hypoxic
  vs. normoxic TNBC cells by miRNA microarray (p < 0.05). (G) miRNA microarray results
  showed miR-494 expression levels significantly decreased in hypoxic TNBC cells.
  Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall survival in patients with variable miR-494 expression
  according to the data from the TCGA database: (H) Breast Cancer (n = 327), P = 0.0038;
  (I) TNBC (n = 49), P = 0.022. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. Each bar represents the mean
  ± SD of three independent experiments.'
