caption: 'Signaling pathways involving the TLR signature through GSEA. (A) KEGG pathways
  that were activated in HCC subjects with high TLR-based RS: apoptosis, cell cycle,
  epithelial cell signaling in Helicobacter pylori infection, oocyte meiosis, pathway
  in cancer, and spliceosome. (B) KEGG pathways that were activated in HCC subjects
  with low TLR-based RS: metabolism cytochrome P450, fatty acid metabolism, glycine
  serine and threonine metabolism, PPAR signaling pathway, and primary bile acid biosynthesis.'
