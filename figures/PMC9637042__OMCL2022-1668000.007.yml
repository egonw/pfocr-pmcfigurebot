caption: 'The effect of autophagy on inflammation and ROS in HRGECs cultured with
  high concentration glucose. (a) The expression of AIF-1 protein was detected by
  western blot. Versus control group, ∗P > 0.05. But compared with control group,
  the expression of NLRP3 protein was upregulated, ∗P < 0.001. (b) The expression
  of miR-34a was detected by qPCR. All the relative levels of results were corrected
  by total protein. Versus control group, ∗P > 0.05. (c) The effect of autophagy on
  ROS level in HRGECs cultured in 30 mmol/L glucose for 48 h. Versus high glucose
  control group, ∗P < 0.001. HRGECs: human renal glomerular endothelial cells; AIF-1:
  allograft inflammatory factor-1; miR-34a: microRNA 34a; NLRP3: NOD-like receptor
  thermal protein domain associated protein 3; ROS: reactive oxygen species.'
