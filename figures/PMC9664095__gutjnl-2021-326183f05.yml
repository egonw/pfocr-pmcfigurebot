caption: IFN and APP signalling cascades are associated with a STAT1-mediated viral/dsRNA
  response. (A) Activity status of key TF regulons according to HPS groups in the
  validation cohort (n=26 in each subgroup). (B) Top upstream regulators from an ingenuity
  pathway analysis (IPA) of the HPS differentially expressed genes in both the discovery
  and validation cohorts (). (C) Enrichment for multiple viral response gene sets
  and dsRNA response in HPS high group compared with low in HiFi tumours in the discovery
  cohort (red=adjusted p<0.05; left). Correlation between ssGSEA scores for viral
  response and HPS gene expression in the discovery cohort (Pearson’s correlation
  r=0.6, p=1.1e-08; right). (D) Enrichment for multiple viral response gene sets and
  dsRNA response in HPS high group compared with low in HiFi tumours in the validation
  cohort (left) (red=adjusted p<0.05). Correlation between ssGSEA scores for viral
  response and HPS gene expression in the validation cohort (Pearson’s correlation
  r=0.7, p=2.4e-08; right). (E) Enrichment for viral response using pair-wise GSEA
  in non-relapse versus relapse HiFi tumours from both the discovery and validation
  cohorts. (F) viral response ssGSEA scores in bone-marrow derived macrophages with
  either wild-type (WT), mutant (Y701F mut) or knockout (KO) STAT1. (n=3 for each
  genotype) (t-test p<0.05). (G) Schematic detailing role for viral response/dsRNA
  signalling in regulating STAT1-mediated signalling cascades, HPS, APP and IFN signalling
  in immune lineages results in a good prognosis HiFi tumour. APP, antigen processing
  and presentation; CRC, colorectal cancer; ds RNA, double stranded RNA; HiFi, high-fibroblast;
  HPS, HiFi-specific prognostic signature; ssGSEA, single-sample GSEA; TF, transcription
  factor.
