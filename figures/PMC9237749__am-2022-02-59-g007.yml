caption: Protein quality control in neurons and other mechanically strained tissue
  cells. Upon the misfolding or unfolding of a protein, molecular chaperones bind
  to these non-native proteins and facilitate the process of refolding. However, if
  refolding is unsuccessful, the HSC70 chaperone is responsible for routing the misfolded
  protein to one of two pathways for degradation. The binding of BAG1, a nucleotide
  exchange factor from the Bcl2-associated athanogene family to the HSC70 CHIP complex
  allows for the inhibition of HSC70â€™s chaperone activity and the polyubiquitination
  of the client by CHIP. This interaction directs the misfolding protein to UPS, in
  which a proteasome breaks down the client. Conversely, the binding of BAG3 and HSPB8
  to the complex reroutes the substrate to CASA. In this pathway, 14-3-3 protein and
  dynein are responsible for facilitating the transportation of the CASA complex along
  microtubules to MTOC, site of autophagosome formation. Here, autophagy receptor
  p62/SQSTM1 attaches to the polyubiquitin chain of the misfolded protein and directs
  the client to the autophagosome through its interaction with the LC3 receptor. The
  misfolded protein is degraded once a lysosome fuses with the autophagosome, forming
  an autolysosome (reproduced from the open source, from Cristofani et al., 2019,
  mod.) .
