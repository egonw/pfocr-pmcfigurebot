caption: PTX and VCR induce MORC2 degradation via the CMA pathway. (A, B) HeLa and
  MCF‐7 cells were preincubated with or without 50 ng/ml bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) for
  1 h and then treated with or without 100 nM PTX (A) or VCR (B) for 24 h. Immunoblotting
  analysis was performed to detect MORC2 protein levels. (C, D) HeLa and MCF‐7 cells
  were transfected with negative control siRNA (siNC) or siRNAs targeting HSPA8 (siHSPA8)
  (C) or LAMP2A (siLAMP2A) (D), followed by treatment with DMSO or 100 nM PTX for
  24 h. Immunoblotting analysis was performed to detect MORC2 protein levels. (E,
  F) HeLa and MCF‐7 cells were transfected with siNC or siHSPA8 (E) or siLAMP2A (F),
  followed by treatment with DMSO or 100 nM VCR for 24 h. Immunoblotting analysis
  was performed to detect MORC2 protein levels. (G, H) HeLa and MCF‐7 cells were treated
  with or without 100 nM PTX (G) or VCR (H) for 24 h. IP analysis was performed using
  control IgG or an anti‐MORC2 antibody to detect the interactions between MORC2 and
  HSPA8/LAMP2A. (I, J) HEK293T cells were transfected with pCDH or Flag‐MORC2 expression
  vector, followed by treatment with or without 100 nM PTX (I) or VCR (J) for 24 h.
  IP analysis using Flag‐tagged beads was performed to detect the interactions between
  exogenous MORC2 and HSPA8/LAMP2A. (K) HeLa and MCF‐7 cells were transfected with
  Flag‐MORC2 expression vector, followed by treatment with or without 100 nM PTX or
  VCR for 24 h. Immunofluorescent staining was performed to detect the co‐localization
  between MORC2 and HSPA8/LAMP2A. Cells were stained with an anti‐Flag (green) or
  HSPA8 (red) or LAMP2A (red) antibody. DAPI (blue) was used to stain DNA.
