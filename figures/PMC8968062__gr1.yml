caption: 'Activation of cGAS-STING pathway potentiates tumorigenesis. (A) Representative
  images of immunofluorescence staining of γH2AX and cGAS in pancreatic tumor tissues
  and matched normal tissue. Scale bar: 50 μm. (B) Representative images of immunofluorescence
  staining of γH2AX and cGAS in different tumor cell lines. Scale bar: 50 μm. (C)
  Knockout effect of cGAS or STING in HeLa, MCF-7 and PANC-1 cells. (D, E) Tumor growth
  curve of the tumor-bearing mice injected with negative control (NC), cGAS-/- and
  STING-/- HeLa or MCF-7 cells. 5 mice were used for each group. (F) The mRNA expression
  of cGAS and STING in pancreatic tumor tissues (GSE16515, GSE15471), breast tumor
  tissue (GSE3744) were compared with those of normal tissues. Data were represented
  as mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.'
