caption: Effects of CHDT on the protein expression of FoxO3a and E3 ubiquitin ligases
  and the serum concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The protein expression
  levels of FoxO3a and E3 ubiquitin ligases were measured by Western blotting in (A)
  QUA and (B) GAS muscles. GAPDH was used as the loading control and the phosphorylation
  of FoxO3a was normalized to the total expression of the protein. (C) Serum concentrations
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Different letters indicate statistically significant
  differences; p < 0.05, a > b > c > d.
