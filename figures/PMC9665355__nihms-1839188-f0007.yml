figure_title: Working model for Impad1 modulation of Golgi morphology and vesicular
  trafficking to drive invasion and metastasis
caption: Loss of the epithelial miRNAs miR-200 and miR~96 de-represses Impad1 during
  EMT. In mesenchymal cells, Impad1 promotes Golgi stacking and condensation as wel
  as vesicular trafficking in an epistatic pathway with Syt11 to enhance exocytosis
  of extracellular components such as MMPs, collagen, and GAGs. This increased secretion
  alters the ECM and TME to drive lung cancer invasion and metastasis.

  vesicular trafficking to drive lung cancer invasion and metastasis.
