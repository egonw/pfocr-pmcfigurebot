caption: Effect of hydroxytyrosol (HT) on the expression levels of HSP60, a marker
  protein of the inflammation process in Raw264.7 cells previously subjected to inflammation
  caused by LPS (0.1 μg·mL−1). Quantification of protein levels by densitometric analysis
  is shown in bar graphs. Results are means ± SEM (n = 9) and are expressed as percentage
  of expression compared to actin levels in Western-blot analysis. Different capital
  letters indicate the existence of significant differences (from p < 0.01 to p <
  0.001) in the different experimental conditions. HSP60, Heat shock proteins (Chaperon)
  of 60 kDa; LPS, Lipopolysaccharide.
