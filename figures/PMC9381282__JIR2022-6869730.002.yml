caption: 'rhALR attenuates renal damage after I/R injury. The 24-hour representative
  kidney sections were shown above. TUNEL staining showed that TUNEL-positive apoptotic
  cells in the renal tubules of the sham operation group were few at first, but the
  number of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells increased 24 h after operation and reached
  a peak at 72 h. The renal function level of the I/R group was the same. The number
  of TUNEL-positive cells in the rhALR1 and rhALR2 groups was lower than that in the
  I/R group at these three time points (magnification ×400). All data were presented
  as the mean ± standard deviation. ∗P < 0.05 vs sham, #P < 0.05 vs. I/R+saline.'
