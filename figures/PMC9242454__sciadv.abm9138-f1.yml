  cells
caption: (A) Proposed route for Kyn-CKA formation following from tryptophan (Trp)
  metabolism. The asterisk denotes the electrophilic carbon. TDO2, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase;
  AFMID, arylformamidase. (B) Nrf2-dependent gene induction by Kyn-CKA (n = 3). (C)
  Nrf2-regulated protein expression 24 hours after Kyn-CKA. (D) Activation of AhR-dependent
  genes by 8-hour Kyn-CKA treatment. (E to G) Kynurenine pathway metabolites 8 hours
  after tryptophan in HBSS (5 mM; n = 3). (H) GSH-Kyn-CKA formation 8 hours after
  N-formylkynurenine (NF-Kyn) or L-Kyn in HBSS in the presence or absence of 1 mM
  probenecid (Prob) (n = 3 per dose). (I) Nrf2-dependent gene expression 8 hours after
  tryptophan in HBSS (n = 3). **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.0001 by one-way analysis of
  variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s test (B and D) or by t test (E to I). ns, not significant.
