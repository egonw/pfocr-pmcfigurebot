caption: Effect of component ratio on metabolomics structure. (A) PLS-DA diagram showing
  the discrimination in metabolite profile in HT-29 cells when they were cultured
  on HA-Tyr/G-Tyr (1%–10% wt) hydrogels with varying component ratios (2:1, 1:1, 1:2
  v/v) for 5 days. (B) Hierarchical clustering analysis obtained by altered metabolites
  in HT-29 cells that were cultured on (1%–10% wt) hydrogels with varying component
  ratios (2:1, 1:1, 1:2 v/v). (C) VIP score plot listing the top discriminated metabolites
  among groups. (D) Pathway impact graph representing the most significantly affected
  pathways in HT-29 cells when they were cultured on HA-Tyr/G-Tyr (1%–10% wt) hydrogels
  with varying component ratios (2:1, 1:1, 1:2 v/v). Data analyses have been conducted
  with MetaboAnalyst (n = 3, technical replicate = 3).
