caption: Model of RIG-I structure and signaling pathway. (A) The structure of RIG-I
  in non-infected cells. (B) RIG-I signaling pathway. During RNA virus infection,
  RIG-I recognizes RNA molecules and undergoes conformational changes that expose
  and multimerize its CARDs, which allows homotypic CARD–CARD interactions with MAVS.
  MAVS is anchored into mitochondria and relays the signal to TBK1 and IKK. These
  in turn activate IRF3 and IRF7, which together with the transcription factor NF-κB
  induce expression of type I IFNs and inflammatory cytokines.
