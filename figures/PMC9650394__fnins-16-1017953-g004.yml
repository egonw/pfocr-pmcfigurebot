caption: Conceptual diagram of the study findings. Relationships among molecular processes
  associated with cerebral white matter damage that may provide insight into the physiologic
  state of the placentas, transcriptomic pathways, and neonatal brain development.
  Five novel signaling pathways eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2),
  interleukin-6 (IL-6), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), growth hormone,
  and tumor protein P53 (p53) in relation to ventriculomegaly associated cerebral
  white matter brain damage relatively early in life. Many of the cellular/molecular
  processes are associated with more than one signaling pathway and there may be shared
  overlap of many of the genes within a given pathway.
