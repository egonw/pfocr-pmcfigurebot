figure_title: Adult APP mice have decreased cell proliferation and immature neurons
  in the dentate gyrus
caption: A Schematic representation of experimental design and timeline of SV treatment.
  B Proliferative Ki67-immunopositive nuclei and doublecortin (DCX)-immunostained
  cell bodies and dendritic projections visualized with DAB in the subgranular zone
  of the dentate gyrus (DG). C Ki67-positive nuclei and immature DCX-positive neurons
  were comparable in number between APP and WT until 120 days of age. As of 120 days,
  a significant decrease in the number of both populations was observed that persisted
  until 180 days of age, being significant at all time points for DCX neurons. D SV
  treatment (90 days) did not affect the number of Ki67 and DCX positive neurons irrespective
  of the age of treatment initiation as reduced numbers of both cell populations compared
  to WT were found at all endpoints (120-180 days), being significant for DCX neurons
  at all ages. Cell nuclei (Ki67) and cell bodies (DCX) were counted in tissue sections
  from APP and WT mice (4–6 mice/group), and expressed as percent of WT (dotted line)
  at different ages (20 to 180 days). Scale bar = 200 µm. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and
  ***p < 0.001, using multiple repeated Student’s t tests (C) or one-way ANOVAs (D).
