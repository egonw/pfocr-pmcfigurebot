figure_title: Effects of AS-A2 on the cell viability and RANKL-induced osteoclast
  differentiation in RAW264.7 cells. (A) The chemical structure of AS-A2 was isolated
  from A. tataricus. (B) RAW264.7 cells were used to treat various AS-A2 concentrations.
  The CCK-8 test kit assessed the cell viability after incubating cells for one to
  six days. (C) TRAP staining was performed on RAW264.7 cells activated with or without
  RANKL (50 ng/mL) in the presence of AS-A2 or the vehicle control, dimethyl sulfoxide.
  (D) The proportion of cells reveals the range of nuclei per cell, and the TRAP +
  MNCs were counted as osteoclasts. Data are presented as mean Â± SD of three unrelated
  experiments
