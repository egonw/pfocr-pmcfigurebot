caption: 'TPT decreases the inflammatory cytokine expression in the BALF of lung tissue
  in acute lung injury induced by cecal ligation and puncture. The mRNA expression
  of TNF‐α, IL‐6, and IL‐1β levels in the BALF (a–c) and their protein expression
  levels (d–f). **p < 0.01: CLP group versus sham group. #p < 0.05: CLP + TPT group
  versus CLP group. &p < 0.05: CLP + PDTC group versus CLP group. BALF, bronchoalveolar
  lavage fluid; CLP, cecal ligation and puncture; IL, interleukin; mRNA, messenger
  RNA; PDTC, ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TPT,
  topotecan;'
article_title: Topotecan reduces sepsis‐induced acute lung injury and decreases the
  inflammatory response via the inhibition of the NF‐κB signaling pathway.
