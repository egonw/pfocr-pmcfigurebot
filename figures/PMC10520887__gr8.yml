caption: Reconstitution of pIKKε in IKKε−/−cells confirms pIKKε participation in STING-mediated
  antiviral response.A–E, pIKKε−/− 3D4/21 cells in 24-well plates were transfected
  with IKKε or pIKKε mutants (1 μg each) for 24 h and then infected with 0.01 MOI
  HSV1 for 24 h. The GFP signals were visualized by fluorescence microscopy (A). The
  infected cells were harvested to measure the protein expressions by Western blotting
  (B), GFP signals by flow cytometry (C), and the HSV1 gB gene and host IFNβ gene
  expressions by RT–qPCR (D and E). F and G, the viral titer in the supernatant from
  HSV1-infected cells was measured by plaque assay (F), and the number of plaques
  are plotted in (G). HSV1, herpes simplex virus 1; IFN, interferon; MOI, multiplicity
  of infection; pIKKε, porcine IKKε; qPCR, quantitative PCR; STING, stimulator of
  IFN genes.
