caption: PNMTF best captures the functional organization of pathways in the healthy
  lung cell. (A) and (B) show a clustered heat map of the pairwise cosine distances
  between all pathway embeddings in the shared space V learned based on graphlet adjacency  by
  GNMTF and PNMTF, respectively. For each heat map, the color bar under the hierarchical
  tree on the top indicates the 65 pathway clusters
