caption: In silico genetic perturbations. KO and constitutive activity of GLP-1. Black
  rectangles correspond to certain components involved in a particular experiment.
  (A) If GLP-1 Notch signaling is knocked out, even though DTC is constitutively active,
  none of the core Notch pathway genes are activated. (B) Upon GLP-1 Notch constitutive
  signaling, the core Notch pathway genes are active throughout the simulation.
