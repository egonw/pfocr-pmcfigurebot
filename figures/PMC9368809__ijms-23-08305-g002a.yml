caption: Transcriptomic characteristics of FOXM1-high and -low HCC (Cohort 2). (A)
  Hierarchical cluster analysis of 2119 genes differentially expressed between FOXM1-high
  and -low HCC. A total of 1275 genes and 844 genes were upregulated or downregulated,
  respectively, in FOXM1-high HCC compared with -low HCC (p < 0.001). (B) Signal intensity
  of probes corresponding to AFP, KRT19, SLCO1B1, and CYP3A4 in FOXM1-high (red bar)
  and -low HCC (green bar) (Mann–Whitney test, means ± SEM). (C) Scatter plots analysis
  of AFP and FOXM1 expression in HCC (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient). (D)
  Pathway analysis of FOXM1 co-regulated genes. Mitotic cell cycle processes were
  activated in FOXM1-high HCC (cluster A, red bars), whereas mature hepatocyte metabolism
  processes were inactivated in FOXM1-low HCC (cluster B, green bars). Significant
  processes are shown. (E) Kaplan–Meier survival analysis with the log-rank test of
  recurrence-free survival in FOXM1-high and -low HCC. Red, FOXM1-high (n = 94); blue,
  FOXM1-low (n = 143). (F) Kaplan–Meier survival analysis with the log-rank test of
  overall survival in FOXM1-high and -low HCC. Red, FOXM1-high (n = 94); blue, FOXM1-low
  (n = 143).
