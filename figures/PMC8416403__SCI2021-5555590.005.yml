caption: 'KEGG pathway analysis of hypoxia-induced hBMSCs. (a) KEGG pathway enrichment
  analysis of differentially expressed proteins from cells treated with or without
  hypoxia. The upregulated (red) proteins were mainly involved in cytokine-cytokine
  receptor interactions and complement and coagulation cascades, whereas the downregulated
  (green) proteins were mainly involved in cancer pathways, the PI3K-Akt signaling
  pathway, proteoglycans in cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and cellular senescence.
  (b) KEGG pathway annotation statistics of differentially expressed proteins (top
  20). The signaling pathway annotations of differentially expressed proteins were
  critically related to pathways in cancer (34 proteins), Alzheimer disease (25 proteins),
  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (24 proteins), the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway (23
  proteins), and Huntington disease (23 proteins). (c) The role of the CDK cluster
  and CCND1 in the PI3K signaling pathway. (d) The role of the CDK cluster in the
  p53 signaling pathway. (e) PPI network of differentially expressed proteins in the
  12-hour hypoxia-induced group. PPI analyses indicated that CDK1, CDK2, and CCND1
  were important nodes. STRING network bonds. Blue: from curated databases; rose pink:
  experimentally determined; green: gene neighborhood; red: gene fusions; navy blue:
  gene co-occurrence; yellow: text mining; black: coexpression; purple: protein homology.'
