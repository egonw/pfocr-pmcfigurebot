caption: CSNK2B activated CDK4/p-Rb/E2F cell cycle pathway. (A) Cignal Finder 10-Pathway
  Reporter Array data in HCC-LM3 cells upon CSNK2B overexpression. (B) Representative
  western blot images showing the effects of CSNK2B overexpression on key protein
  expression of cell cycle pathway. (C) Western blot analysis showing an inhibition
  of CDK4 expression by CSNK2B knockdown. (D) Colony formation assays were performed
  to evaluate whether inhibition of CDK4/p-Rb/E2F cell cycle pathway weakens the effects
  of CSNK2B overexpression on HCC cell proliferation. Representative images (upper)
  and quantitative analysis on colony numbers (bottom) were shown. *P < .05, **P < .01.
