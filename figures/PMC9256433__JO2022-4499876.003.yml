caption: 'miR-146a-5p downregulates WWC2 to activate the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway.
  (a) The Venn map of the intersection of target genes obtained from the TargetScan,
  miRWalk, miRDB, and ENCORI databases and differentially expressed genes in GEPIA2
  database in cervical cancer. (b) Analysis of the expression of WWC2 in cervical
  cancer by GEPIA2 database. Red represents cervical cancer samples, and gray represents
  normal samples, ∗p < 0.05. (c) RT-qPCR determination of WWC2 expression in 30 cases
  of human cervical cancer tissues and 30 cases of normal cervical tissues. (d) RT-qPCR
  determination of WWC2 expression in cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa, CaSki, SiHa,
  and C33A) and normal cervical epithelial cell lines (End1/E6E7 and HcerEpic). (e)
  The predicted binding site of miR-146a-5p and WWC2 from ENCORI database. (f) The
  dual luciferase reporter assay to identify the binding relationship between miR-146a-5p
  and WWC2. (g) RT-qPCR determination of WWC2 mRNA expression in C33A cells. (h) RT-qPCR
  detection of the expression of miR-146a-5p and WWC2 in C33A cells. (i) Western blot
  assay of the protein expression of WWC2, LATS1, and YAP, and the levels of LATS1
  and YAP phosphorylation in C33A cells. (j) Immunofluorescence detection of YAP location
  in C33A cells, scale bar: 25 μm. (k) RT-qPCR determination of the mRNA expression
  of CTGF and Cyr61 in C33A cells. The data in the Figure were measurement data and
  expressed as mean ± standard deviation. The data between two groups were analyzed
  by unpaired t-test, and the comparison among multiple groups was performed by a
  one-way analysis of variance (Dunnett''s post hoc test). ∗p < 0.05. Cell experiments
  were repeated 3 times independently.'
