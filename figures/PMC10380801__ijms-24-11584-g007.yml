caption: 'Overexpression of NCOA7 inhibits the MAPK signaling pathway in vitro. (A)
  The analysis of the enrichment results of the KEGG pathway regarding the high and
  low expression of NCOA7. (B) The inhibition effect of NCOA7 overexpression on the
  MAPK signaling pathway proteins were detected using Western blot in 769-P and 786-O
  cells. (C,D) The effects of Ro 67-7476 on NCOA7-inhibited cell proliferation were
  investigated using CCK-8 assays in ccRCC cells. Ro 67-7476 was added as an p-ERK1/2
  activator. ** p < 0.01 vs. control group, *** p < 0.001 vs. control group, ## p
  < 0.01 vs. NCOA7 overexpression + Ro 67-7476 group. ns, means no significant.'
