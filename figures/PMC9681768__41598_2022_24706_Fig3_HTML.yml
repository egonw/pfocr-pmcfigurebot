caption: 'Expressional changes of essential pyrimidine biosynthetic enzymes regulated
  by oncogene driven signaling. (A) RNAseq analysis of pyrimidine metabolic pathway
  (6 h/12 h/24 h). AKG: α-ketoglutarate, GLU: glutamate, GLN: glutamine, CarP: carbamoyl
  phosphate, OAA: oxaloacetate, ASP: aspartate, C-ASP: carbamoyl-aspartate, DHO: dihydroorotate,
  ORO: orotate, TD: thymidine, T: thymine, GLUD: glutamate dehydrogenase, GLUL: glutamate-ammonia
  ligase, GOT: glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, CAD: carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase,
  aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase complex, DHODH: dihydroorotate dehydrogenase,
  UMPS: UMP synthetase, RRM1/2: ribonucleotide reductase catalytic subunit M1/2, RRM2B:
  ribonucleotide reductase regulatory TP53, NME: nucleoside diphosphate kinase, DUT:
  dUTPase, TYMS: thymidylate synthase, DTYMK: deoxythymidylate kinase, TK1: cytosolic
  thymidine kinase, TYMP: thymidine phosphorylase, SAMHD: SAM and HD domain containing
  dNTP triphosphohydrolase, T001: enzyme translated from CT. (B) Western blot analysis
  of MDA-MB-231 cells was carried out to investigate the expression changes of essential
  pyrimidine biosynthetic enzymes and the oncogene-driven signaling proteins. Original
  blots are presented in  (Figure Raw data).'
