caption: ST2825 arrests the cell cycle progression in RA SFs. A Changes in cell numbers
  at 24, 48, and 72 h upon incubation with 5 and 10 μM of ST2825. B Quantification
  of the percentage of RA SFs in various phases of the cell cycle upon ST2825 treatment
  at 24 h by imaging cytometry. A, B One-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s multiple comparisons
  test were performed to determine statistical significance. C Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  (Qiagen) showing the top 5 canonical pathways predicted to be associated with the
  genes downregulated in RA SFs. D Heatmaps of Log2 RPKM values of genes associated
  with downregulated canonical pathways. E Interatomic gene cluster by STRING showing
  the association of the downregulated genes with cell cycle progression. Association
  strength and false discovery rate (FDR) p-values are presented
