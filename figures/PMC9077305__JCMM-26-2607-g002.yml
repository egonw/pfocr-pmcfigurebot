caption: 'Periplocymarin (PM) attenuated AngⅡ‐induced hypertrophic responses of H9c2
  cells. (A) The chemical structure of PM. (B) H9c2 cells were treated with different
  concentrations of PM for 24 h. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. (C) H9c2
  cells were pretreated with PM (12.5, 25, 50 μM) and 50 μM Val for 3 h, cells were
  then exposed to 1 μM AngⅡ for 24 h. Cell surface area was measured by phalloidin
  staining. Bars: 50 μm. (D) The expressions of collagen I, α‐SMA, TGF‐β1 and ANP
  were detected by Western blot. #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01 and ###p < 0.001 vs. control
  group. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 vs. AngⅡ group. Data were presented as the mean ± SD,
  n = 3'
