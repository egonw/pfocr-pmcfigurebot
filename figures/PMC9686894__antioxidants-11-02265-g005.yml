caption: 'Hedgehog signalling regulates osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation
  in tendon-derived stem cells (TDSCs). (A) qRT–PCR analysis of OCN, RUNX2, and alkaline
  phosphatase (ALP) in TDSCs treated with GANT58 at different concentrations under
  weeklong osteogenic induction. (B) qRT–PCR analysis of OCN, RUNX2, and ALP in TDSCs
  treated with SAG at different concentrations under weeklong osteogenic induction.
  (C) qRT–PCR analysis of OCN, RUNX2, and ALP in TDSCs treated with GANT58 at different
  concentrations under two weeks of osteogenic induction. (D) qRT–PCR analysis of
  OCN, RUNX2, and ALP in TDSCs treated with SAG at different concentrations under
  two weeks of osteogenic induction. (E) ALP staining of TDSCs treated with 25 mM
  GANT58 and 2 mM SAG under weeklong osteogenic induction. Scale bar = 200 μm. (F)
  Quantification of ALP staining. (G) qRT–PCR analysis of AGG, COL2A1, and SOX9 in
  TDSCs treated with GANT58 at different concentrations under weeklong chondrogenic
  induction. (H) qRT–PCR analy Scheme 2. A1 and SOX9 in TDSCs treated with SAG at
  different concentrations under weeklong chondrogenic induction. (I) Alcian blue
  staining of TDSCs treated with 25 mM GANT58 and 2 mM SAG under weeklong chondrogenic
  induction. Scale bar = 200 μm. (J) Quantification of Alcian blue staining. (K) Schematic
  figure showing that Hh signalling affects osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation
  in TDSCs, which are involved in tendon heterotopic ossification. * p < 0.05, **
