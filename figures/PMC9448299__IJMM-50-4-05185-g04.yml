caption: Effect of VASH1 on the invasion and tube formation of HUVECs exposed to hypoxia.
  HUVECs cells were cultured in vitro and exposed to hypoxic condition for different
  time. (A) The protein expression of VASH1 was determined by immunoblotting. (n=3
  per group). (B) Quantification of immunoblot analysis of VASH1 (n=3 per group).
  (C) The mRNA expression of VASH1 was determined by qPCR. (D) The mRNA expression
  of VASH1 in HUVECs transfected with VASH1 siRNA or scramble siRNA was determined
  by qPCR (n=3 per group). (E) The mRNA expression of VASH1 in HUVECs transfected
  with pcDNA3.1-VASH1 or pcDNA3.1 was determined by qPCR (n=3 per group). (F) Representative
  micrographs of scratch wound healing assay and (G) in vitro Matrigel angiogenesis
  assay on HUVECs transfected with scramble siRNA or VASH1 siRNA and exposed to normoxic
  condition, scale bar=100 µm. (H) Representative micrographs of scratch wound healing
  assay and (I) in vitro Matrigel angiogenesis assay on HUVECs transfected with pcDNA3.1
  or pcDNA3.1-VASH1 and exposed to hypoxic condition, scale bar=100 µm. (J and L)
  Relative invasion distance was analyzed by subtracting the final invasion area for
  each image (n=5 per group). (K and M) Quantitative analysis of the tube formation
  of HUVECs (n=5 per group). Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation. VASH1,
  vasohibin 1; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; siRNA, small interfering
  RNA.
