caption: ABA signalling pathways are activated upon desiccation in Sphagnum. (A) Desiccation
  increases ABA in Sphagnum. Capitula from the different species were harvested at
  0, 2, 4, 7 d after drought and from re-watered samples. ABA levels were determined
  by GC-MS. ABA concentrations were then adjusted in relation to the relative water
  content of each sample. Data represent means ±SE for three biological replicates.
  (B) ABA pre-treatment improves desiccation tolerance in Sphagnum. Sphagnum fallax
  plants were desiccated until Fv/Fm value reached 0.2 and kept at this stage for
  1 or 4 d before re-watering as indicated. The percentage Fv/Fm recovery was calculated
  at day 2 after re-watering in relation to the initial Fv/Fm values. Data represent
  means ±SD for four replicate plates. *Significantly different from the untreated
  plants, P<0.05.
