figure_title: LXR agonist reduces fibrosis in Atp7b−/− mouse liver
caption: '(A) LXR agonist reduces fibrosis. Profibrotic marker (COL1α and TIMP1) mRNA
  expression was significantly elevated in KO mouse liver as compared to Het. LXR
  agonist reduced COL1α and TIMP1 expression in KO mice compared to untreated KO (n
  = 8 to 11 male mice per group). (B and C) Liver sections were stained with Sirius
  red (collagen), a representative image of one of the Sirius red–stained liver sections
  is shown, and quantitation of the red stain–positive areas was performed by ImageJ
  (n = 4 to 5 male mice per group). Scale bars, 200 μm. (D) Activated stellate cell
  marker desmin (red color) expression was significantly increased in KO mice as compared
  to Het, which was reduced in response to drug treatment in KO, whereas F4/80 (green)
  macrophage marker was not significantly changed. Scale bars, 20 and 10 μm. n = 4
  mice per group. (E) Significantly altered gene [log2 fold change (FC) with the type
  of gene] of the hepatic fibrosis signaling pathway in KO versus Het, drug-treated
  KO versus KO, and drug-treated KO versus Het mice is displayed in the table (n =
  4 male mice per group). Values represent means ± SD. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01, between
  untreated and treated mice of the same genotype; ##P < 0.01, and ###P < 0.001 between
  untreated Het and KO mice. The blue color symbol denotes Het, purple denotes Het
  + T0, red denotes KO, and magenta denotes KO + T0, respectively.'
