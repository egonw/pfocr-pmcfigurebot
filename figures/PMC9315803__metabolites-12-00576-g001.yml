caption: 'Diagrammatic representation of the gene expression pattern of (a) the key
  enzyme and transporters involved in glucose metabolism and (b) hormone receptors
  involved in insulin signaling pathway and glp-1r signaling in muscle after golden
  pompano (Trachinotus ovatus) were fed CSM0, CSM20, CSM40 and CSN60. Data were represented
  as mean Â± SEM. Different letters above the bars denote significant differences between
  diet groups at the p < 0.05 level. Note: g6pdh, glucose-6-phosphate; hk, hexokinase;
  pk, pyruvate kinase; pfk-1, phosphofructokinase-1; pepck, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase;
  glut2, glucose transport protein 2; glut4, glucose transport protein 4; irs1, insulin
  receptor substrate 1; igf-1r, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor; glp-1r, glucagon-like
  peptide 1 receptor.'
