caption: GLIPR1 activated the TIMP1-CD63-ITGB1-AKT signaling pathway. Protein levels
  of GLIPR1, TIMP1, CD63, ITGB1, and AKT in SHC-44 (A) and SW1783 (B) cells were detected
  by western blot. The relative expression of GLIPR1, TIMP1, CD63, ITGB1, and AKT
  was calculated via normalization to Î²-actin expression. (*) represents a significance
  compared with the Model group. *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.001; ****, P<0.0001.
  NC, normal group; Model, model group.
