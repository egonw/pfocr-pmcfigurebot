caption: GO and KEGG functional enrichment analysis of source genes of DE-circRNAs.
  (A) The y-axis is the GO term at the next level of the three GO categories, and
  the x-axis is the number of source genes annotated for that term. (B) The y-axis
  indicates the pathway name, the x-axis indicates the p-value, the size of the dots
  indicates the number of source genes in the pathway, and the color of the dots corresponds
  to the different âˆ’log10 (q-value) ranges.
