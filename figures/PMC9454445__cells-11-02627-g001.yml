caption: NAD+ metabolism. Tumour cells depend more on glycolysis (in blue) than on
  OXPHOS from the mitochondria (in dashed black). The pentose phosphate pathway (in
  purple), serine biosynthesis (in green), and fatty acid synthesis (in red) are highly
  activated in cancer and depend on glycolysis, which is the axis of cancer metabolism.
  Glutaminolysis (in brown) is also increased as the main source of nitrogen in the
  cell. The NAD+/NADH and NADP+/NADPH cofactors participate in all these pathways,
  allowing rapid energy production, the elimination of excess ROS, and the synthesis
  of macromolecules to support tumour proliferation and development.
