caption: Molecular and genetic modifications in obesity risk to BC development. Molecular
  pathway changes in obesity, including increased insulin levels and development of
  insulin resistance, inducing the synthesis of insulin growth factors I and II (IGF-I,
  IGF-II), inflammation reactions, and their imbalanced levels of adipokines and cytokines
  and expression of leptin receptor LEPR and adiponectin receptor ADIPOR1-2. The high
  aromatization reactions in the fat tissues lead to the high production of estrogen
  hormone. High levels of cholesterol synthesis are regulated by transcription faction
  sterol regulated element binding protein-2 (SERP-2, SERP-1). Downstream activation
  of molecular changes such as Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3 (JAK/STAT3), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase/v-Akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog/mammalian target of rapamycin
  (PI3K/Akt/mTOR occur. The molecular changes induce epigenetic alterations and single
  nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) risk. All these biological modifications induce BC
  development. The illustration was created with BioRender.com, Toronto, Canda.
