caption: Knockdown of MIF and SLC3A2 inhibited epithelial‐mesenchymal transition (EMT)
  in SW480 and SW620 cells. SW480 and SW620 cells were transfected with control shRNA
  (shCon group), shMIF (shMIF group), shSLC3A2 (shSLC3A2 group) or co‐transfected
  with shMIF plus shSLC3A2 (shMIF + shSLC3A2 group), respectively. (A) E‐cadherin
  mRNA expression in SW480 and SW620 cells. (B) N‐cadherin mRNA expression in SW480
  and SW620 cells. (C) E‐cadherin protein expression in SW480 and SW620 cells. (D)
  E‐cadherin protein expression in SW480 and SW620 cells. (E) Western blotting was
  performed to confirm the levels of E‐cadherin and N‐cadherin protein expression
  in SW480 and SW620 cells. (F) Immunofluorescence assays were performed to detect
  E‐cadherin and N‐cadherin protein expression in SW480 and SW620 cells. ‘*’means
  p < 0.05 when compared with the control group; ‘#’ means p < 0.05 when compared
  with shCon group. GAPDH served as an invariant internal control for calculating
  fold changes in protein expression
