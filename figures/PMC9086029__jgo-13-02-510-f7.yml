caption: KEGG pathway and protein analysis of hsa_circRNA_100375/hsa-miR-324-3p/hsa-miR-29a-5p/hsa-miR-485-3p/hsa-miR-149-5p
  axis. (A) The KEGG pathway showed the axis involved in the cancer-related pathway;
  (B) the combined sites of hsa_circRNA_100375 and its 4 cancer-related MREs (hsa-miR-324-3p/hsa-miR-29a-5p/hsa-miR-485-3p/hsa-miR-149-5p).
  (C) Certain hub proteins, such as FGFR1, PTGER2, WNT9B, WNT2B, SP1, CREBBP, IL-6,
  and DVL2, played key roles in the cancer-related pathway. KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes. MREs, miRNA response elements. FGFR1, fibroblast growth factor
  receptor 1; PTGER2, prostaglandin E receptor 2; WNT9B, wingless-type MMTV integration
  site family, member 9B; WNT2B, wingless-type MMTV integration site family, member
  2B; SP1, transcription factor Sp1; CREBBP, cAMP-response element binding protein;
  IL-6, interleukin-6; DVL2, disheveled 2.
