caption: Association of HOXC6 with the EMT pathway. (a) The GSEA showed that the high
  expression of HOXC6 was correlated with enhanced expression of EMT signaling pathway
  components in the TCGA database. (b, c) Representative Western blot results showing
  the protein levels of vimentin, N-cadherin, E-cadherin, and HOXC6 in U87 and U251
  cell lines and HOXC6-deficient GBM cells. ∗p < 0.05,  ∗∗p < 0.01, and∗∗∗p < 0.001.
  Data are shown as means ± SD.
