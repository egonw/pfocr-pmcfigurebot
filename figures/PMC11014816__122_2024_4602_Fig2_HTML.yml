caption: Expression of CBGs in WT and the mutant 221-2-1a. a Heatmap representation
  of the expression levels of CBGs in WT and 221-2-1a. Values are shown as Log2(FPKM + 1).
  b Overview of the capsaicin biosynthesis pathway. Biosynthetic intermediates are
  shown in white ellipses, with the names of each structural gene encoding the enzyme
  responsible for the step shown by the arrows. The expression values are shown as
  Log2([FPKM of WT / FPKM of 221-2-1a] + 1), with black arrows indicating no difference
  between the two genotypes and red indicating higher expression in WT. Most of the
  genes showing decreased expression in the mutant, such as BCAT, BCKDH, ACL, MCAT,
  KasI, KasIII, and FAT, belong to the latter part of valine/leucine metabolism and
  fatty acid biosynthesis pathways. Thee pathways were modified from Mazourek et al.
