caption: GIV acutely promotes Nephrin-dependent glucose-stimulated insulin secretion
  via actin cytoskeleton reorganization in β cells. (1) Src kinase induced GIV-Y1767
  phosphorylation in response to elevated glucose. (2) GIV-Y1767 phosphorylation recruited
  Src kinase to Nephrin for phosphorylating Nephrin. (3) Nephrin phosphorylation induced
  Nephrin endocytosis pathway. (4) Cytoplasm Nephrin from endocytosis and PI3K/Akt
  signaling regulated activities of actin-modulatory protein Rac1 and RhoA, to (5)
  permeabilize a peripheral F-actin barrier, and (6) promoted insulin granule exocytosis.
article_title: The signaling protein GIV/Girdin mediates the Nephrin-dependent insulin
  secretion of pancreatic islet β cells in response to high glucose.
