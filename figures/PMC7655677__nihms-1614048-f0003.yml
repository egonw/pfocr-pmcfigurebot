caption: The biosynthetic pathway of catecholamines is demonstrated, including the
  enzymes necessary for synthesis. Metabolites are also shown as these are frequently
  used in testing. Not all pathways are illustrated, and not all intermediate steps
  are included. Tyrosinase is not expressed in the adrenal medulla or paraganglia,
  but is shown to illustrate the parallel utilization of tyrosine to produce melanin
  in melanocytes. Red circles show the structural region altered by the preceding
  enzymeâ€™s action.
