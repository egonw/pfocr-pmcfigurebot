caption: 'The KOR agonist U50448H decreases the level of ASC-NLRP3 inflammasomes.
  (a) Western blot results of GSDMS-C and GSDMS-N expression in lung tissues; (b)
  Western blot results of NLRP3, ASC, pro-caspase-1, and pro-IL-1β expression in lung
  tissues; (c) immunofluorescence assay results of NLRP3 and ASC proteins in lung
  macrophages (scale bar = 50 μm); (d) ELISA results of IL-18 and IL-1β. ∗P < 0.05
  compared with the Sham group; #P < 0.05 compared with the CPB group.'
