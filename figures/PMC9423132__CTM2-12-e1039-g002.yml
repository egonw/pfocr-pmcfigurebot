caption: Multi‐omics revealed SIRT6 regulating protein process in endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER). (A) Venn's diagram showing the strict SIRT6 downregulated (left, both mRNA
  and protein were downregulated) or upregulated (right, both mRNA and protein were
  upregulated) proteins by SIRT6. (B) KEGG enrichment analysis of 20 strict differential
  proteins regulated by SIRT6; data represented as negative of log 10 of p‐value after
  Bonferroni correction. (C) KEGG enrichment analysis of SIRT6 upregulated metabolites.
  Scatterplots represent p‐value from integrated enrichment analysis and impact values
  from pathway topology analysis using 91 metabolites upregulated by SIRT6. The node
  colour is based on the p‐values and the node radius represents the pathway impact
  values. (D) The pie chart showing metabolites upregulated (left) and downregulated
  (right) by SIRT6. (E) Graphical representation of enzymes and metabolites of the
  sphingolipid synthesis, TCA cycle and urea cycle. Enzymes and metabolites highlighted
  in red are upregulated by SIRT6, whereas those in blue are downregulated by SIRT6.
  (F–H) The mRNA levels of key proteins in protein processing in ER pathway in HMECs
  (F) and HCMECs (G) and HUVECs (H) under oxidative stress. (I) The simple flowchart
  of protein processing in ER. The new proteins entered the ER by SEC after translation
  and were folded by HSP, PPI and PDI. Correct folded proteins are sent to secretion.
  The misfolded proteins were recognised by MAN1A2 and sent to degradation. As for
  those recognised by UGGT, which is activated by SENLENOF, they will undergo misfolded
  proteins cycle. Green labelled proteins were downregulated by SIRT6, red labelled
  proteins were upregulated by SIRT6 in proteomics.
