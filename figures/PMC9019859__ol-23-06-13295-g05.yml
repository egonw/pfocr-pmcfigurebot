caption: 'Silencing of ACSM3 reverses the inhibitory effect of KLF10 on melanoma cell
  apoptosis, migration and invasion. (A) Expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins
  (Bax, Bcl-2 and cleaved caspase 3) were examined by western blotting. (B) Wound
  healing and Transwell assays were used to detect cell migration and invasion. Scale
  bar, 100 Âµm. (C) Western blotting was used to detect the expression levels of metastasis-related
  proteins MMP2 and MMP9. ***P<0.001 vs. Control; ##P<0.01 and ###P<0.001 vs. Ov-KLF10
  + sh-NC. ACSM3, acyl-CoA medium-chain synthetase 3; KLF10, Kruppel-like factor 10;
  NC, negative control; Ov, overexpression; sh, short hairpin RNA.'
article_title: KLF10 upregulates ACSM3 via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway to inhibit
  the malignant progression of melanoma.
