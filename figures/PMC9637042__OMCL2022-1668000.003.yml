caption: 'The effect of AIF-1 or miR-34a on autophagy and inflammation in DKD mice.
  (a) The expression of AIF-1 in db/db mice treatment with miR-34a agonist or antagonist
  was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. (b)The effect of miR-34a on the expression
  of AIF-1, ATG4B, LC3II, p62, and NLRP3 protein in db/db mice was detected by western
  blot. Versus db/m mouse group, ∗P < 0.01. (c) The expression of ATG4B, LC3II, p62,
  and NLRP3 protein in AIF-1 transgenic mice was detected by western blot. Versus
  wild mice group, ∗P < 0.001. (d) The expression of miR-34a in AIF-1 transgenic mice
  was detected by qPCR. Versus wild mice group, ∗P < 0.001. AIF-1: allograft inflammatory
  factor-1; miR-34a: microRNA 34a; ATG4B: autophagy related 4 homolog B; LC3II and
  p62: autophagy-associated protein; NLRP3: NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain
  associated protein 3.'
