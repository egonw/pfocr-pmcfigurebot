caption: 'The p38 MAPK kinase signaling pathway is required in spiroconazol A-induced
  autophagic cell death. (A) After treatment with 2 μM of spiroconazol A for the indicated
  times, cells were examined by Western blot analysis. After pretreatment with 40
  μM of SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor), cells were treated with spiroconazol A for
  24 h and then examined by (B) Western blot analysis and (C) PI staining, respectively.
  Experiments were repeated at least three times, and data are expressed as mean ±
  S.D. The relative optical density ratio was determined using a densitometric analysis
  program (Bio-Rad Quantity One® Software, version 4.6.3 (Basic), Bio-Rad Laboratories
  Inc., CA, USA), normalized to the internal control. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, ***
  p < 0.001 vs. untreated A549 cells and #p < 0.05, ###p < 0.001 vs. spiroconazol
  A-treated A549 cells, by the Student’s t-test.'
