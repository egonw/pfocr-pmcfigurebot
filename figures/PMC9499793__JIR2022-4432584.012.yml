caption: Gypenoside has a protective effect on H2O2-induced oxidative stress through
  the ERK/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. The results showed that compared with the blank
  control group, the expression of p-ERK, Nrf2, and HO-1 increased after H2O2 intervention.
  Compared with the H2O2 group, the expression of p-ERK, Nrf2, and HO-1 in preintervention
  of gypenosides was further increased. (b) Each represents the value obtained by
  dividing the band density of the phosphorylated transcription factor by the same
  total band density of the transcription factor. On the other hand, (c) and (d) are
  expressed by the ratio of band density to β-actin band density. Three samples from
  each of the three GO donors were taken for the experiment. All detections are repeated
  3 times, with 3 replicate wells each time (∗ as P < 0.05 and ∗∗ as P < 0.01; P <
  0.05 means the difference is statistically significant, and P value is analyzed
  by one-way ANOVA).
