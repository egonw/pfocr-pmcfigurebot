caption: 'Generation of drug-resistant ovarian cancer cells from A2780 human ovarian
  cancer cell line(A) Bright-field images of A2780 cells and A2780-R cells. Scale
  bar, 200 μm. (B) The expression of indicated proteins in A2780 and A2780-R cell
  lysates as measured by western blot analysis. GAPDH was used as a loading control.
  (C) Flow cytometric analysis for measuring the ALDH enzymatic activity in A2780
  and A2780-R cells. (D) Cell viability as determined by the MTT assay. A2780 and
  A2780-R cells were treated with doxorubicin or cisplatin at indicated concentrations
  for 48 h. Data are represented as mean ± SEM. ∗p < 0.05; #p < 0.01; ‡p < 0.001.'
