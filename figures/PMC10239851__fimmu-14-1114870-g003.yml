caption: Biological processes and pathways in the azoospermia modules were significantly
  associated with COVID-19. (A) KO salient functional categories that were significantly
  enriched in the turquoise module were shown in green, while those that are significantly
  enriched in the blue module were shown in red. (B) Circos plot showing relationships
  between GO terms and the module genes. Log2 fold changes (FC) of gene expression
  are represented by colored squares. (C) Differences between NOA subject and control
  subject GSVA pathway scores were determined (n= 84 and 25 samples from 109 patients,
  respectively). The t-value obtained by a linear mixed model. (D) GSEA of representative
  KEGG signaling pathways.
