caption: Statistically evaluated major pathways based on significantly altered metabolites
  between the male adult and female adult (A,B), and the female adolescent and female
  adult (D,E). The metabolites evaluated by RM–ANOVA were used to determine the most
  significantly impacted pathways, with p-values presented on the Y-axis and pathway
  impact values on the X-axis (A,D). The circle colors denote significance (p-value),
  while the size of each circle’s radius reflects the pathway’s impact values. The
  most significantly altered canonical pathways, as determined by IPA, are depicted
  in (B,E). Both group sets highlighted steroid hormones and bile acid biosynthesis
  as the primary metabolic pathways affected by DEHP exposure. Significant toxicological
  functions from IPA based on altered metabolites from RM–ANOVA are presented in (C,F).
  Heart, liver, and kidney damage emerged as the primary toxicological effects of
  DEHP administration.
