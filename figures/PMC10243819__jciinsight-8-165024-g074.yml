figure_title: Gene expression signature of hTNFtg SFs treated with amisulpride
caption: (A) Heatmap of the 103 genes identified to be deregulated in hTNFtg versus
  WT SFs and restored upon amisulpride treatment (n = 3). Left panel describes genes
  that are downregulated in hTNFtg versus WT SFs and are upregulated significantly
  upon amisulpride treatment. Right panel describes genes that are upregulated in
  hTNFtg versus WT SFs and are downregulated significantly upon amisulpride treatment.
  (B) Venn diagram presenting the genes being upregulated in hTNFtg versus WT SFs
  while being downregulated upon amisulpride/infliximab treatment (n = 3). (C) Venn
  diagram presenting the genes being downregulated in hTNFtg versus WT SFs while being
  upregulated upon amisulpride/infliximab treatment (n = 3). (D) KEGG pathway analysis
  of the 103 genes described in A (n = 3).
