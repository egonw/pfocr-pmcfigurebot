figure_title: xCT activates the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and enhances MELK expression
  in CRC cells
caption: A DEGs in HCT15 cells with or without xCT shRNA administration. B KEGG analysis
  was performed on the DEGs. C GSEA showed that xCT was upregulated in samples with
  the activation of the hallmark_mTORC1_signaling pathway. D Identification of potential
  factors whose expression might correlate with that of xCT in CRC. E, F The correlation
  between the expression of MELK and xCT in GSE39582 and GSE87211. G, H IF assays
  confirmed that MELK and xCT were strongly colocalized in HCT116 and HCT15 cells.
  I, J Western blot analysis showed that xCT knockdown inhibited the expression level
  of MELK and restrained the activation of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in HCT116
  and HCT15 cells.
article_title: xCT contributes to colorectal cancer tumorigenesis through upregulation
  of the MELK oncogene and activation of the AKT/mTOR cascade.
