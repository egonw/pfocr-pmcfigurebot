figure_title: ESCRT-I deficiency inhibits TFEB S122 phosphorylation and activates
  TFEB/TFE3 factors independently of general mTORC1 signaling
caption: '(A) Representative Western blots showing levels of phosphorylation of TFEB
  at Ser122 and phosphorylations of the indicated canonical mTORC1 targets in RKO
  cells lacking ESCRT-I due to CRISPR/Cas9–mediated TSG101 knockout (gTsg101#1 or
  #2) as compared to control cells (gCtrl#1 or #2, nontargeting gRNAs). The vinculin
  protein is shown as a gel loading control. (B) Single-plane confocal images of fixed
  cells lacking ESCRT-I (siTsg101#2) as compared with control cells (siCtrl#1, nontargeting
  siRNAs) at 48 h post transfection (48 hpt) showing mTOR localization on LAMP1-positive
  structures upon culture in nutrient-rich medium (EMEM) or starvation medium (EBSS)
  for 2 h. Cell nuclei marked with DAPI stain (blue). Scale bar, 20 μm. The dot plot
  on the right shows mTOR colocalization with LAMP1-positive structures in control
  or ESCRT-I–depleted cells calculated based on confocal images including those shown
  on the left. Values derived from independent experiments (dots) and their means
  (n = 4 ± SEM) are presented. ns, nonsignificant. (C) Single-plane confocal images
  of fixed RKO cells at 48 hpt showing intracellular distribution of TFE3 (green)
  with respect to LAMP1 protein (red) or DAPI-stained nuclei (blue) in ESCRT-I–depleted
  or control cells upon 2 h treatment with vehicle (Vh, DMSO) or 1 μM INK128. Scale
  bar, 100 μm. (C, D, E) Dot plots showing the percentage of cells with nuclear TFEB
  localization (D) or TFEB colocalization with LAMP1-positive structures (E) in control
  or ESCRT-I–depleted cells, calculated based on confocal images including those shown
  in (C). Values derived from independent experiments (dots) and their means (n =
  4 ± SEM) are presented. ns, nonsignificant, **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001.'
