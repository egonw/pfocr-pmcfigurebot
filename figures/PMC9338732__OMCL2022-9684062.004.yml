caption: 'Irisin treatment affected the activation of the Hippo signaling pathway.
  (a) The heatmap of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were detected by
  RNA-seq in human nucleus pulposus cells between TNF-α-treated groups and TNF-α plus
  irisin-treated groups. (b) The volcano map of gene distribution (upregulation, downregulation,
  and none). (c) GO analysis terms with the most significant P values were determined,
  including three analyses (BP: biological process, CC: cellular component, and MF:
  molecular function). (d) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed the affected signaling
  pathways with P value less than 0.05. (e) The heatmap of genes'' expression levels,
  including anabolic marker (COL2A1), catabolic markers (MMPs and ADAMTSs), and inflammation
  factors (IL-6 and NLRP3). In this figure, irisin was used at the concentration of
  100 ng/ml and TNF-α was used at the concentration of 10 ng/ml.'
