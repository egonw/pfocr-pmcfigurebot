figure_title: Identification of miRNAs potentially involved in energy metabolism in
  B. dorsalis
caption: (A) Hierarchical clustering analysis of the differentially expressed miRNAs
  in response to dietary yeast stimulation. Heatmap showed two separated clades with
  up-regulated miRNAs in one clade and down-regulated miRNAs in the other clade. The
  color scale indicates the Log2-transformed expression values in the heatmap. (B)
  Expression levels of up-regulated miRNAs in the abdomens of B. dorsalis treated
  with three different dietary regimens, namely, yeast-free diet (yeast-), yeast-rich
  diet (yeast+), and 4-day yeast-free diet followed by 2-day yeast-rich diet (refed).
  Data are expressed as means ±SEM. ****, P< 0.0001; ***, P < 0.001; **, P < 0.01.
  (C-D) Relative expression levels of miR-275 and miR-305 during the larvae-pupa-adult
  developmental stages (C) and different tissues isolated at 5 day post eclosion (DPE)
  of the adult female (D). The smooth curve was fitted using the LOWESS spline method
  with GraphPad Prism to visualize the dynamic expression of miRNA. Different lowercase
  letters above bars denote significant differences (P < 0.05) according to Tukey’s
  test (one-way ANOVA).

  by the insulin signaling pathway in Bactrocera dorsalis.
