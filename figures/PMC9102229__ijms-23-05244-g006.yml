caption: Expression levels of EGF receptor genes of interest and genes involved in
  type I interferon-inducing pathway inhibited by HER2, in DBTRG-05MG and HOS cell
  lines, before and after interferon α2β treatment, as determined by RNA-seq. Expression
  levels of the main EGF receptor genes, EGFR (A); expression levels of ERBB2 encoding
  HER2 co-receptor (B); expression levels of STING1 encoding a major sensor of cytoplasmic
  DNA and an inductor of type I interferon production, which HER2 inactivates through
  Akt1 kinase [] (C); expression levels of IRF3 encoding a transcription factor that
  induces expression of type I interferon genes and lies downstream of STING in the
  pathway (D).
