caption: Overexpression of LTB4R promoted proliferation and clone formation of ccRCC
  cells. (A) RT-qPCR detection of LTB4R overexpression efficiency. (B) Western blot
  experiments to verify the overexpression efficiency of LTB4R. (C) Overexpression
  of LTB4R promoted the proliferative capacity of Caki1 and ACHN cells. (D,E) Overexpression
  of LTB4R promoted clone formation of Caki1 and ACHN cells. A 2-tailed t test was
  used (** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001).
