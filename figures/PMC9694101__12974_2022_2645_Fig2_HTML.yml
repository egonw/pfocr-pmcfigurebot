caption: MiR-26a-3p directly targets the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. A Predicted putative
  seed-matching sites between miR-26a-3p and p38. B The protein–protein interaction
  (PPI) network of p38 MAPK and NF-κB. C The possible interaction mode of p38 and
  NF-κB derived from rats. D The possible interaction mode of p38 and NF-κB derived
  from human. E Knock-down miR-26a-3p increased the protein expression of p38 MAPK.
  F Knock-down miR-26a-3p increased the phosphorylated level of p65. G Knock-down
  miR-26a-3p increased the expression level of NLRP3. Data are presented as the means ± SEMs.
  N = 6 per group. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001
