caption: 'Effect of BLVRB depletion on cholangiocarcinoma cell migration and invasion
  in vitro. A. Relative BLVRB protein levels in cholangiocarcinoma cell lines. B.
  Protein levels of BLVRB and BLVRA were verified by western blotting analysis after
  stable knockdown of BLVRB. C and D. RBE and 9810 cell migration from the upper transwell
  chamber to the lower chambers. BLVRB knockdown promoted the migration of RBE and
  9810 cells. ***P < 0.001. Scale bar: 200 µm. E and F. RBE and 9810 cell invasion
  from the upper transwell chamber to the lower chamber. BLVRB knockdown promoted
  the invasive ability of RBE and 9810 cell lines. ***P < 0.001. Scale bar: 200 µm.
  G. Protein levels of key epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, including
  E-cadherin, claudin, N-cadherin, Snail, and ZEB, after BLVRB knockdown. H. The mRNA
  levels of key EMT markers, including E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Snail, and Slug, after
  BLVRB knockdown. All experiments were performed in triplicate.'
