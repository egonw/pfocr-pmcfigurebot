caption: Genes related to NOTCH signaling, neuron activity, and brain development
  were promoted by treatment in GSC923. A. Enrichment analysis of NOTCH signaling
  gene sets in the TS vs. TC contrast in GSC923. Green line indicates where the expression
  correlation values change sign. Red line indicates where the leading-edge set starts.
  Image bar below indicates the sorted gene expression level. B. Significantly affected
  pathways by treatment across both cell lines. C. Expression pattern of gene sets
  related to brain cell differentiation and development. D. Expression pattern of
  gene sets related to neuron activities and brain development. E. Expression levels
  for select genes in the NOTCH signaling gene sets in GSC923. F. Enrichment scores
  (ES) for gene sets related to the MYC signaling pathway.
