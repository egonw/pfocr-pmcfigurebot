caption: 'BTD suppressed tumor growth in vivo. CT26 tumor-bearing mice were treated
  with 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg of BTD, or vehicle. (A) Tumor volume curve of the mice.
  (B) The bars represent tumor weight. (C) Body weight curve of the mice. (D) IHC
  staining for cleaved caspase-3, MMP9, and Ki-67 in tumor tissues. (E) Serological
  and hematological analyses. The units of the parameters are as follows: white blood
  cell (WBC) red blood cell (RBC) (1012/L), hemoglobin (HGB) (g/L), platelet (PLT)
  (109/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (U/L),
  total protein (TP) (g/L), creatinine (CREA), uric acid (UA) (μM), cholesterol (CHOL)
  (mM), and triglyceride (TG). (F) H&E staining of the heart, liver, spleen, lung,
  and kidney (×100).'
