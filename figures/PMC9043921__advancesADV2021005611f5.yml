caption: Platelet-specific deletion of SHARPIN curtails Met-1 ubiquitination and reduces
  NF-κB pathway signaling. Western blots of SHARPINfl/fl Pf4-Cre or SHARPINfl/fl GPIbα-Cre
  mouse platelets following stimulation with an agonist cocktail of 400 μM of PAR4
  agonist peptide, 50 μM of ADP, and 50 μM of epinephrine, lysed at the indicated
  times, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and blotted for Met-1 ubiquitin (n = 3) (A) and phosphoserine
  536 (B) of the p65 (RelA) subunit of NF-κB. (C) Summary of signal intensity of pS536
  NF-κB (n = 5; *P < .05). β-actin re-probes were used as loading controls. (D) Western
  blot of OTULIN indicating similar levels in SHARPINfl/fl GPIbα-Cre− and SHARPINfl/fl
  GPIbα-Cre+platelet lysate (n = 3).

  through associations with αIIbβ3 and LUBAC.
