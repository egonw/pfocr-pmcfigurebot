caption: Osteopontin signaling in cardiomyocytes. Various factors such as endothelin-1
  (ET-1), norepinephrine (NE), sodium-hydrogen exchanger isoform-1 (NHE-1), reactive
  oxygen species (ROS), dexamethasone (DEX), and aldosterone (Aldo) upregulate osteopontin
  (OPN) in cardiomyocytes. In turn, osteopontin regulates several processes in cardiomyocytes
  via modulating certain signaling pathways. These pathways include induction of hypertrophic
  genes expression via integrin- and CD44-mediated signaling pathways, cardiomyocyte
  hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction via blocking mitochondrial protein oxoglutarate
  dehydrogenase-like (OGDHL), and cardiomyocyte apoptosis via mitochondrial apoptosis
  signaling pathway, attenuation of the beneficial effects of adrenergic signaling
  by directly binding and blocking G-Î± subunit of the adrenergic receptors. The overall
  effect of osteopontin signaling in cardiomyocytes results in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy,
  cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and cardiomyocyte mitochondrial dysfunction.
