caption: ZmGLP1 transgenic Arabidopsis enhances resistance to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum
  through the jasmonic-acid-mediated signaling pathway. (A) Jasmonic acid contents
  in the different groups at 6 h post Sclerotinia sclerotiorum infection. (B) Phenotypes
  of the different groups at 3 d post Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, which were pretreated
  with DIECA for 24 h. (C) Disease indexes of the different groups. (D) Trypan blue
  staining and DAB staining of the different groups. (E) Detection of H2O2 content
  of Arabidopsis leaves at 3 d in different groups. Different letters in subfigures
  (A,C,E) indicated significant difference between different samples by Duncan’s post-hoc
  test. Data are presented as the mean ± SD based on three biological replicates.
