caption: The microbial composition of EBOT and EOC tissues is distinct. (A) The Chao1
  index. (B) The Shannon index. (C) PCoA of the weighted UniFrac distance demonstrated
  that the EBOT and EOC tissues showed two distinct clusters. (D) Venn map representation
  of OTUs. (E) Microbial composition in epithelial ovarian tumours at the phylum level.
  The relative abundance of (F) Firmicutes, (G) Bacteroidetes, and (H) Acidobacteria
  were analysed. Data are presented as means Â± SD; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p
  < 0.001.
