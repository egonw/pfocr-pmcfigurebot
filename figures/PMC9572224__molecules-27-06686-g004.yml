caption: The cell cycle distribution of DBTRG-05MG cell lines. (A) The cell was distributed
  in the population of G0/G1, S, and G2/M of cell cycle phases after 72 h exposed
  to different concentrations of andrographolide (13.95 μM and 27.9 μM) compared with
  untreated cells (0.2% DMSO). (B) The percentage of cells (%) for each cell cycle
  phase is shown in the bar graph. (C) Apoptosis analysis of DBTRG-05MG cell lines
  after exposure with LC50 (13.95 μM), 2LC50 (27.9 μM) of andrographolide, and control
  (0.2% of DMSO) were observed using annexin V-FITC and PI staining. (D) The percentage
  of apoptosis cells increased after the concentration of andrographolide increased
  compared to control.
