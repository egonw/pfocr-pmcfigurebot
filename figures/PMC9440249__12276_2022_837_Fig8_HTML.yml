figure_title: MiR-375 regulated the expression of AR by targeting the PTPN4-STAT3
  signaling pathway
caption: 'AR protein (a) and mRNA (b) levels in BPH and PCa cell lines. c The protein
  levels of AR in miR-375-overexpressing or miR-375-knockdown DU145 and PC-3 cells
  compared with the control cells. Western blotting was conducted to evaluate AR expression
  in DU145 and PC-3 cells in response to d overexpression of miR-375 and/or PTPN4
  and e suppression of miR-375 and/or PTPN4. f The effect of miR-375 AMO on the protein
  expression of AR in DU145 and PC-3 cells. The mRNA expression of AR in DU145 and
  PC-3 cells was verified via qRT-PCR after miR-375 was overexpressed (g) or knocked
  down (h). i The correlation between miR-375 levels and AR in PCa, statistically
  processed by StarBase. r = 0.096, p = 3.28e-2. j The expression of miR-375 and k
  AR in PCa tissues compared with paired normal prostate tissues from TCGA database.
  The mRNA levels of AR in PTPN4- and/or miR-375-overexpressing (l) and PTPN4- and/or
  miR-375-suppressed (m) DU145 and PC-3 cells, determined by qRT-PCR. n qRT-PCR results
  showing the transcription levels of AR in DU145 and PC-3 cells after treatment with
  e-375i or the controls. o Western blot showing the expression of AR in DU145 tumor
  tissues as the expression of miR-375 was manipulated. p IHC analysis of AR expression
  in DU145 tumor tissues as miR-375 expression was manipulated. q Western blotting
  showing the expression of AR in tumor tissues treated with e-375i. r IHC analysis
  of the expression of AR in the e-375i and e-NC groups. Scramble: cells stably transfected
  with pHB-U6-MCS-PGK-PURO-empty vector and transiently transfected with siNC. SiPTPN4:
  cells stably transfected with pHB-U6-MCS-PGK-PURO-empty vector and transiently transfected
  with siPTPN4 vector. Sp miR-375: cells stably transfected with pHB-U6-MCS-PGK-PURO-miR-375
  sponge and transiently transfected with siNC. Sp miR-375 + siPTPN4: cells stably
  transfected with pHB-U6-MCS-PGK-PURO-miR-375 recombinant vector and transiently
  transfected with siPTPN4.'
