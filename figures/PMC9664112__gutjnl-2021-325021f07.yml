caption: Altered microbiota by cigarette smoke increases colonocyte proliferation,
  impaired gut barrier function and enhances oncogenic MAPK/ERK and proinflammatory
  genes expression in germ-free mice. (A) Representative images of immunohistochemistry
  staining of Ki67 positive cells and proportion of Ki67 positive cells in the colon
  of germ-free mice. (B) Protein expression of PCNA in the colon of germ-free mice
  by western blot. (C) Protein expression of claudin-3 and ZO-1 in the colon of germ-free
  mice by western blot. (D) LPS concentration in the serum of mice in the GF-AOM and
  GF-AOMS group. (E) Electron microscope showing the structure of the colorectal gut
  barrier of germ-free mice. Arrows point to cell-cell junction. (F) Differential
  expressed genes of colonic epithelium in the GF-AOMS group compared with the GF-AOM
  group by Mouse Cancer Pathway Finder PCR Array analysis. (G) The altered cancer
  signalling pathways in the GF-AOMS group compared with the GF-AOM group by enrichment
  analysis. Enrichment scores >1 were included. The arrows represent the direction
  of enrichment, calculated by comparing the upregulated and downregulated genes in
  the pathway. The differentially expressed genes in MAPK signalling pathway were
  shown in network. (H) Protein expressions of ERK1/2 in the colon of mice in the
  GF-AOM and GF-AOMS group by western blot. (I) Differential expressed genes of colonic
  epithelium in the GF-AOMS group compared with the GF-AOM group by Mouse Inflammatory
  Response and Autoimmunity Array analysis. (J) The altered inflammatory signalling
  pathways in the GF-AOMS group compared with the GF-AOM by enrichment analysis. Enrichment
  scores >1 were included. The differentially expressed genes in TNF and IL-17 signalling
  pathways were shown in network. (K) Gene expression of Il-17a, Cxcl2 and Cxcr2 by
  quantitative RT-PCR. (a) Tight junction; (b) adherens junction; (c) desmosome; (d)
  gap junction. An asterisk indicates a disrupted cell junction. Data are expressed
  as mean±SD. *p<0.05; statistical significance was determined by two-tailed unpaired
  Student’s t-test. p values were adjusted by FDR (). AOM, azoxymethane; ERK, extracellular
  signal‑regulated protein kinase; GF-AOM, germ-free mice gavaged with stool from
  AOM donor mice; GF-AOMS, germ-free mice gavaged with stool from AOM+Smoking donor
  mice; Il, interleukin; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; RT-PCR, reverse transcription
  PCR; TNF, tumour necrosis factor
