caption: Complement cascade schematic illustration. There are three pathways involved
  in complement-mediated renal involvement, namely the classical, lectin, and alternative
  pathways. The classical pathway can be activated by the complex formation of antigens
  and antibodies. When mannose-binding lectin (MBL) binds to serine proteases, known
  as mannose-associated serine proteases (MASP1 and MASP2), the lectin pathway is
  activated. The alternative pathway is initiated when complement C3 covalently binds
  to microbial surfaces and undergoes cleavage, resulting in the formation of C3b.
  Each pathway ultimately generates active C3 convertases, leading to the cleavage
  of C3 into C3a and C3b fragments. C3b can then interact with C4b2a or C3bBb, generating
  C5 convertases. Under the action of C5 convertases, C5 is cleaved into C5a and C5b.
  C5b binds to cell membranes and, along with C6, C7, C8, and C9, forms the membrane
  attack complex (MAC), leading to cell lysis. Additionally, complement products such
  as C3a, C4a, and C5a act as anaphylatoxins and chemotaxis, attracting and activating
  immune cells, thereby inducing an inflammatory response.
