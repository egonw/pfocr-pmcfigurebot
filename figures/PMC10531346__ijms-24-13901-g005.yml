caption: 'Enzyme kinetic assays for DFR, DFR, and ANR: (A) Michaelis-Menten curves
  for wild-type PvDFRa for various substrates. The curves were constructed using initial
  rate measurements. For each reaction, the concentration of NADPH was held constant
  at 2 mM and the concentrations of substrates were varied. All experiments were conducted
  in triplicate (n = 3). PvDFRa was most active with DHQ and minimally active with
  eriodictyol. (B) Michaelis-Menten curves for SbDFR3 under the same conditions. (C)
  Michaelis-Menten curves for PvDFRa T143S mutant under the same conditions. (D) Michaelis-Menten
  curves for PvDFR Q242A mutant under the same conditions. (E) Michaelis-Menten curves
  for cyanidin conversion to all four isomers of catechin in SbANR and SbFNR2. (F)
  Steady-state initial rates plotted against DHM concentration with varying concentrations
  of quercetin acting as an inhibitor. The data were processed using GraphPad Prism
  8.0.2 (San Diego, CA, USA).'
