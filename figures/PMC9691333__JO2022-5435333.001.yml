caption: Increased circ_0004488 levels in CSC-enriched populations of cervical cancer
  cells. (a) QRT-PCR analysis showed that CSC-enriched spheres had a higher concentration
  of CSC markers compared to parental cell lines. (b) PRPSAP2 exons are back-spliced
  to create circ_0004488. (c) Expression of circ_0004488 was examined in cervical
  cancer cell lines and a normal cell line using quantitative real-time polymerase
  chain reaction. (d) Expression of circ_0004488 and PRPSAP2 mRNA was measured in
  cervical cancer cells treated with or without RNase R by quantitative real-time
  polymerase chain reaction. (e) Circ_0004488 expression in human cervical cancer
  and adjacent normal tissues. (f) Circ_0004488 expression in either paclitaxel-sensitive
  or -resistant SiHa cells. (g) Circ_0004488 tissue levels in paclitaxel-resistant
  and -sensitive cervical carcinoma. (h) A comparison of the prognosis for individuals
  with cervical cancer who express high levels of circ_0004488 with those who express
  low levels of this gene is shown in the panel. (i) Circ_0004488 was mostly located
  in the cytoplasm of cervical cancer cells. ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
