caption: RELA∙OGG1 complex formation is induced by RSV. Shown are PLAs for RELA∙OGG1
  complex in (A) control cells and (B) RSV-infected cells. Sites of protein–protein
  interactions (red foci) are nuclei of infected cells. Nuclei of cells are counter-stained
  with DAPI (blue). Note the intense staining in fused syncytia. Scale bar, 40 μm.
