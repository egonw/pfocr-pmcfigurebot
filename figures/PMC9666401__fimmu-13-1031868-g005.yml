caption: HSP90AA1 reduces the protein levels of CSFV NS5A. (A, B) EGFP-NS5A or EGFP-NS4A
  protein expression in HSP90AA1-expressing PK-15 and 3D4/2 cells. PK-15 and 3D4/2
  cells were co-transfected with pEGFP-NS5A or EGFP-NS4A with a different amount of
  p3×Flag-HSP90AA1. Western blot analyzed EGFP-NS5A or EGFP-NS4A protein expression
  at 24 hours post co-transfected. Tubulin served as an internal control. The relative
  levels of EGFP-NS5A or EGFP-NS4A were estimated by histograms representing density
  reading of the gel bands with Image J, and the ratios were calculated relative to
  tubulin control. (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 calculated using one-way
  ANOVA, ns, not significant).

  via the JAK/STAT and NF-κB signaling pathway.
