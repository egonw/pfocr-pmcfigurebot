caption: SSS regulates ISC proliferation partially through the GABA signalling pathway.
  (A) Total sleep (left) and sleep per hour (right) of the indicated genotypes. Mean
  and SEM. (B–G) Representative immunofluorescence images of Dl staining (red; ISC
  marker) in the R4 or R5 region of the midguts of the indicated genotypes. (H) Quantification
  of the number of pH3+ cells in the gut with the indicated genotype. Each dot corresponds
  to one gut. Mean and SD. (I) Quantification of Dl+ cell ratio per 3.4 × 104 μm2
  in the midgut with the indicated genotype. Each dot corresponds to one ROI. Mean
  and SD. (J) Quantification of the percentage of gut acid–base homeostasis in flies
  with the indicated genotypes. Fisher's exact test. **p < 0.01, ****p < 0.0001, NS = not
  significant. (K) Quantification of fly excretions from the above indicated genotypes.
  Mean and SD. (L) Quantification of the percentage of ‘Smurf’ flies in the indicated
  genotypes. Error bars represent the SD of three independent experiments. (M) A model
  illustrating the role of sss in controlling ISC proliferation and intestinal function
  through the brain‐to‐gut communication. Scale bar = 10 μm. DAPI‐stained nuclei are
  shown in blue. WT = wild type, Student's t test, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ****p < 0.0001,
  NS = not significant.
