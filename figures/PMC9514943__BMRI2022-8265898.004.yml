caption: PD promoted human/rat-washed platelet aggregation by depending on high Ca2+
  concentration. (a) The effect of PD on aggregation rate of human washed platelets
  with 1 mM Ca2+. (b) The effect of PD on aggregation rate of rat-washed platelets
  with 1 mM Ca2. (c) The effect of PD on the ATP release of human washed platelets
  with 1 mM Ca2+. (d) The effect of PD on the CD62P expression of human washed platelets
  with 1 mM Ca2+. (e) The effect of PD on the PAC-1 binding rate of human washed platelets
  with 1 mM Ca2+. The data are expressed as mean ± SD (n = 3). ∗∗p < 0.01 and ∗∗∗p
  < 0.001 compared to the vehicle group.
