caption: Overexpression of KLF4 inhibited bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in
  vivo. Mice were intratracheally administered with bleomycin to induce pulmonary
  fibrosis. Saline was used as a control in the KLF4-overexpressing mice group and
  the wild-type group. Masson staining (a) and collagen III immunohistochemical analysis
  (b) were used to detect collagen deposition. Representative images from six mice
  per group are shown. Scale bar of the Masson staining image = 1000 μm; scale bar
  of the immunohistochemical analysis image = 50 μm. Transmission electron microscopy
  was used to observe changes in the morphology of endoplasmic reticulum (c) and mitochondria
  (d). Representative images from three mice per group are shown. Scale bar = 200
  μm.
