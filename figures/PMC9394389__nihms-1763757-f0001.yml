figure_title: Overview of the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway and patient numbers / overall
  cohort prevalence for distinct KRAS alleles/amplification in seven cancer types
caption: 'A) Schematic representation of the MAPK pathway with the cycling KRAS and
  upstream/downstream effectors. B) Distribution of KRAS alleles/amplification and
  patient numbers in selected tumor types. Mutation and amplification rates for KRAS
  have been derived from the AACR GENIE 9.0-public database, while patient numbers
  for the respective tumor types have been extracted from ACS Cancer Facts and Figures
  2020 (). The number of cases for lung adenocarcinoma where set to 40% of all lung
  cancers. In total, 81,996 distinct samples with mutation and copy number profiles
  were collapsed into unique patient samples and filtered for distinct alleles and
  amplification in KRAS. The top seven alleles/amplifications with the highest overall
  prevalence across tumor types are shown, while other mutations were grouped into
  the class ‘Other’. The grouping ‘Multiple’ contains all cases, for which different
  KRAS alterations have been observed in a single patient, for example, two different
  mutations or a mutation coupled with KRAS amplification. The ‘Total’ subpanel summarizes
  the patient numbers for the seven cancer types depicted, and ranks the alterations
  based on overall numbers. Similarly, patient numbers are highlighted for each tumor
  type and each alteration. The percentages in parentheses reflect the proportion
  in relation to the full cohort, e.g., 13.6% of all lung adenocarcinoma patients
  carry a KRAS G12C mutation. AMP denotes amplification. CRC: colorectal cancer, EAC/GEJC:
  esophageal adenocarcinoma/gastroesophageal junction cancer, EGFR: epidermal growth
  factor receptor, IDC: invasive ductal carcinoma, LUAD: lung adenocarcinoma, mTOR:
  mammalian target of rapamycin, PDAC: pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, STAD: stomach
  adenocarcinoma, UEC: undifferentiated endometrial carcinoma.'
