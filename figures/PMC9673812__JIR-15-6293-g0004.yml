caption: Sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate alleviates cholesterol crystals-induced mitochondrial
  damage in HUVECs. HUVECs were incubated with 500 μM cholesterol crystals (CC) for
  16 h. 10, 20, 40 μM Sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate (STS) was added 1 h before CC
  treatment. (A) Representative images of TMRE staining in HUVECs that were stained
  with TMRE (red, to label MMP) and Hoechst 33342 (blue, to label nuclear). (B) HUVECs
  were stained with Mito-SOX probe (red, to label mtROS), Mito-tracker Green (green,
  to label mitochondrial) and Hoechst 33342 (blue, to label nuclear) and images were
  detected under Confocal High-Content Imaging System. Data are represented as mean ± SD
  of three independent replicates;**P < 0.01 vs VEH group; §P < 0.05, §§P < 0.01 vs
  cholesterol crystals group; Scale bar = 10 μm.
