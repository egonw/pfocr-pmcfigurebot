caption: Signal transduction pathways afforded by sensor histidine kinases of Mycobacterium
  tuberculosis. Cross‐talk between two‐component system (TCS) proteins represents
  a mechanism to expand the signaling repertoire of mycobacteria, whereby a sensor
  kinase (SK) from one pathway communicates with a non‐cognate response regulator
  (RR) from another pathway by phosphorylation. Promiscuous SKs that are capable of
  phosphorylating more than one substrate represent multi‐to‐one signaling pathways,
  further increasing the input recognition capabilities of RRs, thereby expanding
  and/or tuning the subsequent responses via the phosphorylated RR
