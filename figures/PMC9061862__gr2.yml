caption: CGA is a downstream target of L3MBTL2(A) RNA-seq were used to identify differentially
  expressed genes in L3MBTL2 stably knockdown cells when compared with their corresponding
  controls (fold change >2 or 2.0, p < 0.05).(B) The relative mRNA levels of CGA,
  CDKN1A, FN1, S100P, and CLIC3 in RNA-seq of PANC-1 cells after L3MBTL2 knockdown.(C)
  KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs was performed to identify functionally
  related gene pathways. The top 10 enriched signaling pathways are shown and are
  ranked on the basis of log10(P-value).(D) qPCR and western blotting were performed
  to determine the mRNA and protein levels of CGA in shL3MBTL2 and shCtrl cells.(E)
  Western blotting analysis of CGA in PANC-1 cells expressing exogenous CGA-T1, CGA-T1-NQ,
  CGA-T2, CGA-T2-NQ, shCtrl, and shL3MBTL2.(F) A luciferase reporter assay evaluated
  the effect of L3MBTL2 overexpression and knockdown on the transcriptional activity
  of CGA in PANC-1 cells. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase
  activity and expressed as the mean ± SD. Data are presented as means ± SD (n = 3).
