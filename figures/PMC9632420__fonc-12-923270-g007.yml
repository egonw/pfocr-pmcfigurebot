caption: Role of USP8 in prostate cancer. USP8 stabilizes both EGFR and PI3K, which
  leads to elevation in the expression of IKKα. The elevated IKKα phosphorylates IkBα
  and dissociates p65 from IkBα and is translocated into the nucleus acting as a transcription
  factor that activates the NF-kB signaling pathway, thereby increasing prostate cancer
  cell growth and survival as well as prostate cancer cell migration and invasion
  by increasing N-cadherin and decreasing E-cadherin, and suppressing prostate cancer
  cell apoptosis by decreasing cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved caspase 9.
article_title: Knockdown of USP8 inhibits prostate cancer cell growth, proliferation,
  and metastasis and promotes docetaxel’s activity by suppressing the NF-kB signaling
  pathway.
