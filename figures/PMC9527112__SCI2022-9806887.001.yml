caption: Identification of PDLSCs and establishment of inflammatory microenvironment.
  (a) Primary passage PDLSCs derived from periodontal ligament and the first passage
  PDLSCs digested from primary passage. (b) Observed osteogenic induction of PDLSCs
  under fluorescent inverted microscope. (c) Observed lipogenic induction of PDLSCs
  under fluorescent inverted microscope. (d) Flow cytometry detected cell surface
  marker (CD44, CD105, CD90, CD31, and CD45). (e) mRNA expression level of IL-1β and
  IL-8 compared to β-actin through qPCR. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3);
  ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001.
