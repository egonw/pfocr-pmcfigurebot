caption: Animal level verification Baicalein inhibits the growth of lung cancer tumors.
  (a) Representative pictures of tumors in the control group and Baicalein treatment
  group. (b) Detect the tumor volume of A549 cells after Baicalein administration.
  (c) Detect the tumor weight of A549 cells after Baicalein administration. (d) Detect
  the expression of SMYD2 in tumor tissues after administration of Baicalein after
  A549 cells are tumor-bearing. (e) Detect the expression of RPS7 in tumor tissues
  after administration of Baicalein after A549 cells are tumor-bearing. ∗P < 0.05,
   ∗∗P < 0.01, and∗∗∗P < 0.001.
