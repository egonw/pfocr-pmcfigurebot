caption: Effect of azilsartan on TNFα-induced NF-kB activation. The levels of NF-kB
  p65 (A) and cleaved caspase 3 (B) proteins in non-stimulated and TNFα (20 and 40
  ng/mL)-stimulated MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cancer cell lines were measured. Bars represent
  mean ± SD, n = 3. Significant difference was analyzed by student t test, where **
  p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, compared to the corresponding azilsartan-untreated cells.

  Transition in Breast Cancer Cells by Azilsartan.
