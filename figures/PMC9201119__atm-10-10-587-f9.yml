caption: GE protects mitochondrial function in RPE cells under hyperglycemia through
  AKT/miR-4429/JAK2. (A) The CCK-8 assay was used to detect the changes in RPE cell
  activity after adding GE, GE combined with AKT inhibitor, and GE combined with miR-4429-mimics,
  si-miR-4429, and JAK2 inhibitor under hyperglycemia; (B) RT-PCR was used to detect
  the expression changes of CYT C1 in RPE cells after adding GE, GE combined with
  AKT inhibitor, and GE combined with miR-4429-mimics, si-miR-4429, and JAK2 inhibitor
  under hyperglycemia; (C) RT-PCR was used to detect the expression changes of miR-4429
  in RPE cells after adding GE, GE combined AKT inhibitor, and GE combined with miR-4429-mimics,
  si-miR-4429, and JAK2 inhibitor under hyperglycemia; (D) the results of Seahorse
  cell energy metabolism analysis; (E-H) energy metabolism analysis results showed
  the changes in the basal respiratory rate, maximal respiratory capacity, and ATP
  synthesis capacity after adding GE, GE combined with AKT inhibitor, and GE combined
  with miR-4429-mimics, si-miR-4429, and JAK2 inhibitor (*P<0.1). OD, optical density;
