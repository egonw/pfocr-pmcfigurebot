caption: 'Tranilast alleviates LPS-induced apoptosis in the BEAS-2B cells. (A) TUNEL
  analysis of apoptosis in the BEAS-2B cells treated with or without LPS and/or tranilast
  at different concentrations. (B) Western blot analysis was used to determine the
  protein expression level of the apoptosis-related proteins, Bcl2, Bax and cleaved
  caspase-3 in the BEAS-2B cells treated with or without LPS and/or tranilast at different
  concentrations. ***P<0.001 vs. control; ###P<0.001 vs. LPS. LPS, lipopolysaccharide.'
