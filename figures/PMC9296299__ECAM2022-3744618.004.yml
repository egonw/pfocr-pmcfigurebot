caption: By detecting EMT-related PNS, it was found that PNS could effectively inhibit
  the occurrence of TGF-β1-induced EMT. The gene and protein of E-cad, FN, and Vim
  were detected by qPCR and Western blotting, respectively (a)-(b). ∗P < 0.05. ∗∗P
  < 0.01. ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. Control group. ＃P < 0.05. ＃＃P < 0.01. ＃＃＃P < 0.001 vs.
  TGF-β1 group. (c) Then immunofluorescence technology was selected to further detect
  the fluorescence expression levels of EMT signal molecules E-cad, Vim, and FN (magnification,
  ×500).
