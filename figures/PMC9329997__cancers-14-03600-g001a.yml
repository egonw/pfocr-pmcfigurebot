caption: PDK1 levels were upregulated by HDAC2 and EZH2, which are associated with
  glycolysis. (A) The expression levels of PDK1 were analyzed in normal and breast
  cancer tissues from GEO dataset (GSE22820). (B) The relapse-free survival time was
  analyzed in groups with high and low expression of PDK1. (C) The protein levels
  of PDK1 were detected by Western blotting in MCF10A, MCF7, and MDA-MB-231 breast
  cancer cell lines. (D) The Pearson’s correlation analysis was conducted to test
  the correlation between levels of PDK1 and HDACs, including HDAC1-7. The data distribution,
  correlation coefficients between genes, and statistical significance were shown;
  the most significant correlation is indicated with a red border. (E) The Pearson’s
  correlation analysis was used to verify the correlation between PDK1 and PRC2, including
  EZH2, SUZ12, and EED levels. (F) HDAC2 and EZH2 protein levels were detected by
  Western blotting (G–I). The GSEA program was employed to analyze HALLMARK_GLYCOLYSIS
  pathway enrichment scores between (G) PDK1 high- and low-expression groups, (H)
  HDAC2 high- and low-expression groups, and (I) EZH2 high- and low-expression groups
  in TCGA BRCA dataset. (J) The protein expression levels of PDK1 were measured by
  Western blotting in the MDA-MB-231 control group (siNC), HDAC2 silencing group (siHDAC2),
  and EZH2 silencing group (siEZH2). Using the median value as the grouping standard.
  *** Indicates significant difference at p < 0.001, **** indicates significant difference
