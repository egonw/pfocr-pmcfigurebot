caption: Overexpression of miR‐20a promotes cisplatin‐resistant in A549/DDP and H1299/DDP
  cells. (A and B) qRT‐PCR results showed that the expression levels of miR‐20a were
  increased or decreased in A549/DDP and H1299/DDP cells after miR‐20a mimics or inhibitor
  transfection. (C and D) Overexpression of miR‐20a led to a substantial increase
  in the DDP IC50 value, whereas suppression of miR‐20a expression by miR‐20a led
  to a substantial decrease in the DDP IC50 value in A549/DDP and H1299/DDP cells,
  and outcomes are means ± standard deviation (SD) (**p < .01; ***p < .001)
article_title: Cancer‐associated fibroblast‐derived exosomal microRNA‐20a suppresses
  the PTEN/PI3K‐AKT pathway to promote the progression and chemoresistance of non‐small
  cell lung cancer.
