caption: FAM107A overexpression inhibited the proliferation of PCa cells in vitro.
  (A) The Western blotting analysis confirmed the effect of FAM107A overexpression.
  The unit of molecular weight is kDa. (B) Comparison of the proliferative capacity
  of the two groups of cells, detected using the CCK-8 kit, with OD values measured
  every 24 h. (C,D) Comparison of the colony-forming ability of the two groups of
  cells. Colony formation was quantified 14 days after colony formation using ImageJ
  software. (E) Immunofluorescence was used to detect Ki67 expression in the cells
  at a magnification of 400×. Similar results were obtained, and data are expressed
  as the mean ± SD of at least three experiments. *** for p < 0.001, and ** for p
  < 0.01.
