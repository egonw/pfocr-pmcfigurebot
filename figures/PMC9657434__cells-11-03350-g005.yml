caption: Pathways activated in B cells. All the proteins listed in  are comparable
  to the Mus musculus in the Panther classification pathway analysis and the results
  demonstrated positive regulation of the MDA5 signaling pathway with highest fold
  enrichment over 100; the pathways activated with these proteins are demonstrated.
  The fold changes are listed in the column on the right.
