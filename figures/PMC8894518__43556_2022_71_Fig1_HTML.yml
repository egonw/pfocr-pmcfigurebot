caption: Receptor tyrosine kinases and associated pathways in TNBC. RTKs bind to extracellular
  ligands, then activated RTKs then activates downstream PI3K/AKT/ mTOR and Ras/MAPK
  pathway signaling pathways. After Ras family (N-Ras, M-Ras, H-Ras and K-Ras) is
  activated, downstream Raf, MEK and ERK in turn transfers the signals released from
  Ras to the nucleus, and finally drives tumor cell proliferation and survival. PI3K
  is firstly activated by RTKs, and then phosphorylates PIP2 into PIP3, which binds
  to AKT, and followed by phosphorylation of threonine. And AKT and mTOR are completely
  activated in turn. PTEN is a negative regulatory phosphatase of PI3K signaling,
  which can suppress tumor by converting PIP3 to PIP2
