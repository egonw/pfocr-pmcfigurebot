caption: The schematic diagram illustrates the roles of flagella in Salmonella-mediated
  cancer therapy. Flagella are actively involved in Salmonella-mediated cancer therapy
  both as major locomotory organelles which increase the infectivity, as well as PAMPs
  activating the host immune response both systemically and intratumorally. The Flagellin/TLR5/NF-κB
  signalling pathway plays an important role during this process.

  Flagellin/TLR5 signalling within tumor microenvironment.
