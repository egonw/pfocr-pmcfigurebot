caption: 'Curcumin pretreatments alleviated loss of cell viability and increased oxidative
  stress induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) in primary rat
  astrocyte. (a) Summary of data presenting astrocyte proliferation using the CCK8
  test. (b, c) Summary of data presenting intracellular malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations
  and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels with commercial kits. (d) Summary of data
  presenting intracellular endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) level by enzyme-linked
  immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. (e) Summary of data presenting intracellular reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) production with flow cytometry. Versus control group, ∗P <
  0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, respectively; versus OGD/R group, #P < 0.05, ##P
  < 0.01, and ###P < 0.001. (n = 3). OD = optical density.'
