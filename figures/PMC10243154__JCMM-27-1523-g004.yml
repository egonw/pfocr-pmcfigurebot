caption: RNF12 activates AKT signalling pathway. (A, B) Western blots showing that
  RNF12 overexpression increased the phosphorylation of EGFR and its downstream signalling
  molecules in MHCC97H and Huh7 cells. (C, D) Western blots showing that RNF12 knockdown
  decreased the phosphorylation of EGFR and its downstream signalling molecules in
  HepG2 and HLF cells.
