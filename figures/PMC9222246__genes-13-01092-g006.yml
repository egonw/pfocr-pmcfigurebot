caption: Expression analysis of carotenoid biosynthesis genes. (A) Carotenoid biosynthetic
  pathway in plants. Genes that were missing in this study and genes with <5 TPM values
  are shown in blue. (B) Heatmap analysis of genes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis.
  (a) Genes cluster showing a high expression in the 90 DAP roots. (b) Genes cluster
  showing a strong expression in the 90 DAP flowers. (c) Genes cluster showing a high
  expression in the 90 DAP leaves and flowers. Genes highlighted in red indicate genes
  assigned to each cluster and the number in parentheses is the total number of genes
  encoding the enzyme expressed in R. glutinosa transcriptome. TPM, transcripts per
  million.
