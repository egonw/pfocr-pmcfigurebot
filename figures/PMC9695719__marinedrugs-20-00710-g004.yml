caption: SC inhibits the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway in glutamate-treated
  HT22 cells. HT22 cells were incubated with various doses of SC for 1 h, and then
  further incubated with 5 mM glutamate for 1 h. The expression levels of proteins
  involved in NF-κB signaling pathway such as IκBα (A,B), cytoplasmic NF-κB p65 (A,C),
  and nuclear NF-κB p65 (A,D) were detected by Western blot assay. The statistical
  symbols (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; n.s., no significance) indicate significant differences
  from the glutamate-treated group.
