figure_title: DKK1 inhibitor improved spatial learning and memory and hippocampal
  β-catenin protein levels in APP mice
caption: A Schematic representation of experimental design and timeline of DKK1 inhibitor
  (DKKi) treatment. B One month of icv administration of the DKKi WAY-262611 restored
  spatial learning during all days of hidden platform testing in treated APP mice
  (blue triangle) compared to untreated APP mice that were severely impaired (red
  triangle) in the Morris water maze (MWM2) compared to both WT and APP mice treated
  with the DKKi. C During the probe trial, APP mice demonstrated deficits compared
  to WT, as shown here by a shorter time spent in the target quadrant and less crossings
  over the previous location of the platform. DKKi-treated APP mice had restored memory
  as shown by the same time spent in the target quadrant as WT controls, but precision
  was not improved as crossings over the previous location of the platform were still
  impaired. D Representative Western blots of β-catenin expression in WT, APP and
  DKKi-treated APP mice. Although hippocampal β-catenin protein levels were not significantly
  decreased in APP mice compared to WT, the DKKi WAY-262611 significantly increased
  them in treated APP mice. (E) DCX-immunostained dendritic extensions were counted
  in three segments (L1, L2, and L3) of the DG molecular layer in APP and DKKi-treated
  APP mice. Although more extensions were present in L2 and L3, it did not reach significance
  (F). *APP compared to WT (B); DKKi-treated APP compared to APP (B). *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01;
  ***p < 0.001 using one-way ANOVA and repeated measures ANOVA followed by Newman–Keuls
  post-hoc test.
