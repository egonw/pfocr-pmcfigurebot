caption: Interaction mechanism between EVs and curcumin. In vitro, curcumin-primed
  exosomes potently ameliorate cognitive function in AD model by inhibiting hyperphosphorylation
  of the Tau protein through the AKT/GSK-3β pathway. In vivo, Exo-Cur mediates various
  effects on cancer cells including proliferation, apoptosis, metastasis and anti-cancer
  drug resistance. Cur, curcumin; Exo, Exosomes; AD, Alzheimer’s disease; PTEN/PI3K/AKT,
  phosphatase and tensin homolog/phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B; PDCD4,
  programmed cell death protein 4; GSK-3β, glucogen synthase kinase-3 beta; BBB, blood
  brain barrier.
