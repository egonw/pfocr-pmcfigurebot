caption: Local intercellular communication analysis discloses the activation of CXCR3
  pathway in acute murine cardiac allograft rejection. (A) All significant signaling
  pathways were ranked based on their differences in overall information flow within
  the inferred networks between Ctrl-HT and Allo-HT. The top signaling pathways (colored
  blue) are more enriched in Ctrl-HT, and the bottom signaling pathways (colored red)
  are more enriched in Allo-HT. (B) CXCL signaling pathway network in Ctrl-HT. (C)
  CXCL signaling pathway network in Allo-HT. (D) Expression distribution of CXCR3
  signaling genes (Cxcr3, Cxcl9, and Cxcl10) at Ctrl-HT (blue) and Allo-HT (red).
  (E) The expression level of CXCR3 in T cells was assessed by Flow cytometry (F)
  Bar plots show the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CXCR3 in T cells (n = 3).
  (G) Bar plots show the positive proportion of CXCR3+ T cells in different groups
  (n = 3). (H) Bar plots show the relative expression level of CXCR3, CXCL9, CXCL10,
  and CXCL11 in human heart transplant endomyocardial biopsies (n = 210 in No-rejection
  group, n = 38 in rejection group). All data are representative of three independent
  experiments at least. One-way ANOVA was used for comparisons among multiple groups.
  Two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test was used for comparisons between two groups.
  Data represented as the mean Â± SD. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, **** p < 0.0001.
