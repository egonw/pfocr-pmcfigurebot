caption: 'The protective effect of LGU on ischemic injury in MCAO rats. (A) neurological
  deficit scores; (B) brain water content rate (%); (C) infarction volume rate (%);
  and (D) representative images of brain slices by TTC staining. LGU (0.24, 0.72,
  and 2.16 mg/kg) and the positive control drug ED (5 mg/kg) were injected into the
  tail vein at 0.5 h after MCAO. The neurological deficit scores, infarction volume
  rate, and brain water content were evaluated at 24 h after MCAO. Data are expressed
  as the mean ± SEM. The adult male SD rats weighed 280–300 g, n = 8–12. ###: p <
  0.001 vs. sham group, *: p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01 vs. MCAO group, and ED: edaravone.'
