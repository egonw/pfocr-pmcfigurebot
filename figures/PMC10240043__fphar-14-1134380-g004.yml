caption: 'PUE attenuates hippocampal neuron injury after MCAO/R via PI3K/Akt/Nrf2.
  (A) The expression and location of Nrf2 were determined by immunohistochemistry
  assay (×400). (B) Representative protein imprinting image of PI3K, Akt, P-PI3K,
  P-Akt, Keap1, Nucleus Nrf2, Cytoplasm Nrf2 and HO-1 in hippocampal neurons of the
  ischemic side of rat brain tissue. (C) Quantitative analysis of p-PI3K/PI3K protein
  expression. (D) Quantitative analysis of p-Akt/Akt protein expression. (E) Quantitative
  analysis of Keap1 protein expression. (F) Quantitative analysis of Nucleus Nrf2
  protein expression. (G) Quantitative analysis of Cytoplasm Nrf2 protein expression.
  (H) Quantitative analysis of HO-1 protein expression. All data are expressed as
  mean ± SD. ##p < 0.01 vs. sham group, *p < 0.05 or **p < 0.01 vs. model group, △p
  < 0.05 or △△p < 0.01 vs. PUE group.'
