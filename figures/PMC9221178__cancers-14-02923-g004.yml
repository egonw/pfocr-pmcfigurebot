caption: TLR-MAPK/ERK signaling in the progression or regression of cancer. MAPK/ERK
  pathway activation can occur through MyD88-dependent or MyD88-independent TRIF signaling.
  The MyD88-dependent and -independent signaling converges in the activation of the
  TAK1 complex. Following the activation of the TAK1 complex, MEKK1/2, MKK4/7, and
  MKK3/6 are activated. MEKK1/2, MKK4/7, and MKK3/6 activation leads to the activation
  of ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK, respectively. Signaling from ERK1/2, JNK, and p38
  MAPK can promote tumor growth or inhibition, APC modulation, angiogenesis, and metastasis.
