caption: Fatty acid β-oxidation in prostate LN-Flu cells. (A) Box and whisker plot
  of metabolites involved in the pathway. (B) Levels of carnitine palmitoyl transferase
  1 (CPT1) and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1α (PGC1α)
  determined by Western blot. Densitometric analysis of the western blot bands from
  three independent experiments is shown on the right. (C) Fatty acid β-oxidation
  determined by Results are the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. **p
  < 0.01 significant difference between LNCaP and LN-Flu cells by two-way ANOVA and
  Sidak’s multiple comparisons test. (D) Fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) scheme showing
  the metabolites and enzymes we have found up (red arrow up) or down (red arrow down)
  in LNFlu cells compared to LNCaP cells. CPT1, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1;
  CAT carnitine:acylcarnitine translocase; CPT2, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2;
  PGC1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1α; PPARγ, peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor γ.
