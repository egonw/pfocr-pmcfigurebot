caption: 'Circulating miRNAs. Circulating miRNAs arise in different ways: (1) Pre-miRNAs
  leave the nucleus and enter the classical processing pathway, where they might be
  secreted in their free form, by an unknown route, and circulate associated with
  high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and Argonaute proteins (AGO, as demonstrated in number
  (4). Alternatively, they might be incorporated into multivesicular bodies (MVB)
  and secreted into exosomes; (2) pre-miRNAs are integrated into MVBs and released
  through exosomes, finishing their processing in target cells; (3) both pre-miRNA
  and mature miRNA can be integrated into microvesicles that sprout from the cell
  surface and reach the bloodstream.'
