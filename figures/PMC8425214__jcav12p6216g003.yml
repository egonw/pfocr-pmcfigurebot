caption: The downstream regulatory network of the Hippo signaling pathway. After YAP
  enters the nucleus, it needs to be combined with other proteins to form a complex
  before it could regulate transcription. After that, it could inhibit the transcription
  of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR), creatine kinase (MCK), non-receptor
  tyrosine kinase (Src) and stimulator of interferon response cGAMP interactor 1 (STING).
  It could also promote the transcription of Cyclin E, epidermal growth factor (EGF),
  Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), cellular communication network factor 1
  (CCN1) and Drosophila melanogaster (DLAP1).
