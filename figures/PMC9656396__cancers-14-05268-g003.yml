caption: Akt mTOR signaling Pathway in Lipid Synthesis. The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
  (PI3K)/Akt and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling regulate lipid
  metabolism. The most often dysregulated mechanism in cancer is PI3K signaling, which
  promotes growth, proliferation, and survival. When receptor tyrosine kinases are
  activated, PI3K is recruited to the plasma membrane and phosphorylates Phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3). AKT
  binds to PIP3, allowing PDK1 and mTORC2 to activate. AKT stimulates lipogenesis
  directly by inhibiting Glycogen synthase kinase 3, activating ATP citrate lyase
  to make acetyl-CoA, and phosphorylating NADK to produce NADP+ for NADPH production.
  PI3K signaling is also intertwined with mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 controls lipogenesis
  by inhibiting lipin-1, a negative regulator of nuclear Sterol regulatory element-binding
  protein-1c, and activating the splicing factor Serine/threonine-protein kinase (SRPK2),
  boosting the production of lipogenic enzymes such as ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), Fatty
  acid synthase (FASN), and acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2). Finally, mTORC2 activation
  promotes lipogenesis via AKT-dependent and independent processes, with the latter
  involving phosphorylation of serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK1) and
  Protein kinase C (PKCs), followed by sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c
  (SREBP1c) activation.
