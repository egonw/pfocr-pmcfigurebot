caption: Oxidative stress and inflammatory response in MAC-T cells. Proteins’ expressions
  were detected with ELISA kits. RT-qPCR was used to verify mRNA expression. GAPDH
  was used as a control. (A) The measurement of oxidative damage and antioxidant capacity.
  (B) The expression of TGF-β1 mRNA and protein and the expression of proteins of
  the TGF-β signaling inflammatory signaling pathway. (C) The mRNA and protein expressions
  of inflammatory cytokines. CG, control group, the cells were routinely cultured.
  H2O2, hydrogen peroxide stimulation group. LTG, H2O2 + 20 μg/mL tea polyphenols
  treatment group. NTG, H2O2 + 40 μg/mL tea polyphenols treatment group. HTG, H2O2
  + 60 μg/mL tea polyphenols treatment group. The asterisk represents the comparison
  with H2O2, and p < 0.05 is significantly different from H2O2. The experimental data
  represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
