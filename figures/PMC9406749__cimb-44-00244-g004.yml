caption: Pathway enrichment analysis observed for KEGG, Reactome, and Wikipathways.
  A group-based pathway analysis was used to observe the pathwaysâ€™ connectivity with
  OC. On the figure, different groups of pathways consist of different colors. The
  group pathways of KEGG cell cycle and influenza A (26.67 percent) for Reactome,
  the group of pathways Formation of Cyclin B:Cdc2 complexes (27.69 percent), and
  the group of pathways Type I Interferon Induction and Signaling During SARS-CoV-2
  Infection (33.33 percent)are highly significant (* means significant and ** means
  highly significant).
