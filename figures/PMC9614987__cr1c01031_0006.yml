caption: Exemplary profiles of the total serum N-glycome using (A) HILIC-UHPLC-FLD,
  (B) CGE-LIF, and (C) MALDI-MS. (A) Chromatogram after 2-AB labeling by HILIC-UHPLC-FLD.
  (B) Electropherogram after APTS labeling by CGE-LIF. (C) Mass spectrum after differential
  sialic acid esterification by MALDI-FT-ICR-MS. The assigned signals in the MS spectra
  correspond to [M + Na]+. Please note that HILIC-UHPLC-FLD and CGE-LIF provide (in
  some cases) isomer separation in regard to branching (galactose arm, bisection,
  and fucose position). Structures are assigned based on exoglycosidase treatment
  and/or tandem MS data as well as literature knowledge on biosynthetic pathway of
  N-glycans. *Some signals for the HILIC-UHPLC-FLD and CGE-LIF correspond to multiple
  N-glycan compositions for which the most abundant one is assigned in the figure.
