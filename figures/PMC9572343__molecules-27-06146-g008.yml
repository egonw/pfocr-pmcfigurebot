caption: SP600125 Reverses the EMT-Induced By Dox In Breast Cancer Cells. MDA-MB-231
  cells were incubated with SP6000125 (20 µM) for 1 h then treated with Dox (0.1 or
  1 µM) for the indicated time. (A) The wounded area was photographed (10×) and %
  of wound closure was evaluated and the result expressed as a percentage based on
  the ratio of the treated cells to the controls. (B) A cell invasion assay was performed,
  and invaded cells were photographed. Cell lysates were prepared, separated by SDS-PAGE,
  and then assessed for (C) N-cadherin, vimentin, and β-Actin. Each value represents
  the mean ± S.E.M of three independent experiments. * p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01, ***
  p ≤ 0.001 compared with the correspondent control.
