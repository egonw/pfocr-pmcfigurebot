caption: Galangin activates the Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. (A) HT22 cells
  were treated with galangin in the absence or presence of 6-OHDA at the indicated
  concentrations for 24 h. After treatment, cell lysates were collected and harvested
  for the protein detection of Keap1, Nrf2, HO-1, and β-actin by western blot. (B)
  The bar chart indicates the relative density of Keap1 to β-actin. (C) The bar chart
  indicates the relative density of Nrf2 to β-actin. (D) The bar chart indicates the
  relative density of HO-1 to β-actin. Bars, S.D., * p ≤ 0.05, *** p ≤ 0.001. The
  full-length Western blotting images are shown in .
