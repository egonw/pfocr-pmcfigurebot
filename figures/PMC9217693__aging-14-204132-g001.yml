caption: Cell proliferation, clone, migration, and invasion of UC3 and 5637 cells
  were evaluated after ZNF139/circZNF139 overexpression or knockdown.  (A–B) CCK8
  assay was employed to assess the proliferation of UC3 and 5637 cells with ZNF139/circZNF139
  overexpression or knockdown. (C–D) Crystal violet staining was used to examine the
  colony formation of UC3 and 5637 cells with ZNF139/circZNF139 overexpression or
  knockdown. (E–F) Scratch wound healing assay was employed to evaluate the migration
  of UC3 and 5637 cells with ZNF139/circZNF139 overexpression or knockdown. Images
  of cell migration at 0 and 48 h transfection are shown at a magnification of 40×.
  (G–H) Transwell assay was used to analyze the invasion of UC3 and 5637 cells with
  ZNF139/circZNF139 overexpression or knockdown. Images are representative of the
  cells invading one field at a magnification of 100×. *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01. ZNF139,
  zinc finger with KRAB and SCAN domains 1; circ, circular; h, hour.
