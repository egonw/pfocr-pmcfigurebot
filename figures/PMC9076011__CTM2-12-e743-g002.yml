caption: Identifying the C‐terminal domain of doublecortin‐like kinase 1 (DCLK1) to
  interact with cell cycle and apoptosis regulator 1 (CCAR1). (A) Tandem Affinity
  Purification‐Mass Spectrometry analysis showed DCLK1‐binding proteins in HEK293T
  cells. The number of peptides for each protein identified was listed. (B) Gene Set
  Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of single gene showed that DCLK1 was positively correlated
  to Wnt/β‐catenin signal pathway. The original mRNA expression data were gained from
  the TCGA database (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/TCGA‐COAD), and the gene
  set pathway data were gained from the enrichment pathway collection of the KEGG
  database on the GSEA data analysis website (http://www.gsea‐msigdb.org/gsea/login.jsp).
  (C and D) HEK293T cells co‐transfected with Flag‐DCLK1 and Myc‐CCAR1 constructs
  for 24 h were lysed with NP40 buffer. Then cell lysates were collected and analysed
  by immunoprecipitation using S‐protein agarose beads or Myc agarose and Western
  blotting with the indicated antibodies (n = 3). (E) HCT116 cells were collected
  and conducted to immunoprecipitation using anti‐DCLK1 or anti‐CCAR1 antibodies,
  and then analysed by Western blotting (n = 3). (F) Immunofluorescence staining determined
  the location of DCLK1 (red) and CCAR1 (green) proteins. (G) The Duolink PLA probe
  experiment detected the interaction between DCLK1 and CCAR. (H) Schematic description
  of wild‐type DCLK1 (DCLK1‐WT) and DCLK1 deletion mutants (DCLK1‐MT) used in this
  study. (I) HEK293T cells co‐transfected with the indicated constructs encoding Flag‐DCLK1
  and indicated CCAR1 mutants for 24 h were collected and lysed. Then the supernatants
  were conducted to immunoprecipitation using S‐protein agarose beads, and analysed
  by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies (n = 3). KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia
