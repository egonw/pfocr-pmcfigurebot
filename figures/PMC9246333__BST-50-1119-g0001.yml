caption: 'The electron transfer chain (ETC) consisting of Complex I–IV contribute
  in generating electron flows (e−) necessary for proton (H+) pumping from the matrix
  (M) to the intermembrane space (IMS) across the inner membrane (IM). Complex I modules
  are indicated: NADH-binding (N), ubiquinone-binding (Q), carbonic anhydrase-like
  (CAL), proximal proton-pumping (PP), and distal proton-pumping (PD). Electrons are
  carried by mobile electron carriers such as ubiquinone (UQ) and cytochrome c (Cyt
  c). Plant mitochondria also contain alternative ETC components, such as type II
  NAD(P)H dehydrogenases NDA and NDB, and alternative oxidase (AOX). Proton gradient
  is then used by the ATP synthase to drive ATP synthesis. Topographical heatmap depicting
  turnover rate of individual subunits (per day, d−1) in Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia-0
  ecotype (wild-type) seedlings, from relatively slow (blue) to relatively fast (red).
  Grey regions represent subunits that were unreliably detected. Data were retrieved
  from Li et al. [].'
