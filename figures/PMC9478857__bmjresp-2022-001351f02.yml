caption: 'Intracellular regulation of airway smooth muscle cells contraction. Smooth
  muscle cells contraction and relaxation cycle depends on phosphorylation and dephosphorylation
  of MLC, respectively. Increase of intracellular Ca2+ concentration in response to
  bronchoconstrictor stimuli leads to the CaM-dependent activation of MLCK, which
  phosphorylates MLC: it is the Ca2+pathway. In parallel, activation of RhoA–Rock
  pathways and CPI-17 deactivates MLCP, which prevents MLC from dephosphorylation:
  it is the Ca2+ sensitisation. β-NAD, beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; cADP-r,
