caption: Changes in microvessel density. All changes in this study were entered by
  the author into Excel software, and the statistical processing software was calculated
  using SPSS 25.0, expressed as mean ± standard deviation, independent sample t-test.
  The expression of notch1 protein in the cerebral cortex at 6 h, 1 d, and 3 d after
  ischemia showed a gradual increasing trend, reaching a peak at 3 d, while the expression
  of Hes1 protein showed a process of first decreasing and then increasing. At 6 h
  after ischemia, the expression of Hes1 protein was significantly lower than the
  normal level, and the protein expression level increased significantly at 1 d and
  3 d.
