caption: Expression prolife of HOBX9, TGF-β1 pathway and MAPK pathway in HCC cell
  lines. (a) RT-qPCR analysis of HOXB9 expression in immortalized human live cell
  (THLE3) and HCC cell lines (including BEL-7402, BEL-7404, BEL-7405, HepG2, Hep3B,
  and SNU475). (b–c) Western blot was used to detect the expression of TGF-β1 signaling
  pathway (including Smad7, Smurf2, TGF-β1, and p-Smad2) in THLE3 cells and HCC cell
  lines. (d–e) Western blot was used to detect the expression of MAPK signaling pathway
  (including ERK1/2, p-38, and JNK pathway) in THLE3 cells and HCC cell lines. ∗P
  < 0.05 vs. THLE3.
