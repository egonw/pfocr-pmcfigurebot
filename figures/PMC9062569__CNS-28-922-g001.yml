caption: '(A) Schematic drawing of inhibition of the GABAB receptor‐mediated signaling
  pathway in the shrew PONV model. In shrews showing emetic behaviors, expression
  of the ADCY1 gene, which encodes adenyl cyclase (orange), was increased, whereas
  expression of the GABBR1 and CACNB1 genes, which encode GABAB receptor R1 subunit
  (green) and voltage‐gated calcium channel (blue), was decreased. Administration
  of pharmacological baclofen (a GABAB receptor agonist) eliminated emetic behaviors
  in the shrew PONV model. (B) Expression levels of the GABBR1, ADCY1, and CACNB1 genes
  in whole‐transcriptome sequencing. Bar graphs and error bars indicate means and
  standard errors of the means. The gene expression of GABBR1 and CACNB1 was not observed
  in the Surgery group. FPKM value: fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped
  fragments for quantifying the assembled transcript expression'
