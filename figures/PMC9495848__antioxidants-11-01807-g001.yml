caption: Mitochondrial electron transport chain dysfunction triggers iron accumulation
  in neurons. (A) CRISPRi of several genes associated with mitochondrial electron
  transport chain components (boxes), including complexes I, II, III and IV subunits
  (colored red in the atomic structure); numerous assembly factors and enzymes in
  the ubiquinone biosynthesis pathway induces lysosomal iron accumulation in human
  iPSC-derived glutamatergic neurons. (B) CRISPRi downregulated genes associated with
  iron accumulation also show diminished expression in a cellular model of PD (SNCA-A53T-expressing
  dopaminergic neurons). Most of these genes encode mitochondrial ETC subunits [,].
  (C) Comparative model between yeast and human cells of the regulatory mechanism
  linking dysfunctional mitochondrial ETC with iron regulation through ISCs synthesis.
