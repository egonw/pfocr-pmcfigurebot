caption: The EGFR-PI3K-AKT signaling pathway is down-regulated by Maytenus compound
  at the cell level in vitro and the animal level in vivo. (A) Maytenus compound suppresses
  EGFR-PI3K-AKT signaling pathway in subcutaneous tumor in nude mice. (B) Maytenus
  compound inhibits EGFR-PI3K-AKT signaling pathway in a dose-dependent manner in
  HepG2 cells. (C) A schematic diagram of the signal pathway that Maytenus compound
  inhibits HCC cell proliferation and induces cell cycle arrest via suppression of
  EGFR-PI3K-AKT pathway.
article_title: The Yunnan national medicine Maytenus compound inhibits the proliferation
  of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by suppressing the activation of the EGFR-PI3K-AKT
  signaling pathway.
