caption: Effect of EMPA on Hippo signalling pathway in CDAHFD-induced mice. (a) Western
  blot of mice liver protein extracts with the indicated antibodies. (b) Quantitation
  and normalisation of phospho-specific signal to total protein or total protein to
  β-actin from a. (c) The relative expression of cyr61, cTGF, and AREG was determined
  via real-time PCR. ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 in the comparisons of the CD-fed
  mice with the CDAHFD-fed mice. † p < 0.05, †† p < 0.01, and ††† p < 0.001 in the
  comparisons of the CDAHFD-fed mice with the EMPA treatment groups.
