caption: LINC00092 influenced BC cell functions and glycolysis via modulating the
  AKT/mTOR pathway. (a) After LINC00092 or sh-LINC00092 transfection, the AKT, p-AKT,
  mTOR, p-mTOR, and p-p70S6K protein levels in cells were evaluated by western blotting.
  N = 3. (b) IHC assay was utilized to test p-mTOR and p-P70S6K expressions in mouse
  xenograft BC tissues. N = 6. Following LINC00092 transfection and SC79 treatment,
  cell viabilities (c), proliferation (d), migration (e), and invasion (f) were tested
  via CCK-8 assay, colony formation assay, cell scratch assay, and two-chamber transwell
  assay, respectively. (g, h) Cell lactate production and glucose consumption were
  tested. N = 3. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
