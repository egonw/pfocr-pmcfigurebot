caption: The mechanism of OA and high irradiance acting on the physiological activities
  of coccolithophores. The graph is modified from studies of calcification and photosynthetic
  pathway analysis [,], with green lines indicating that the process is inhibited
  by OA and yellow indicating that the process is affected by a high irradiance.
