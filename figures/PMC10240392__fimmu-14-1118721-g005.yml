caption: Targeting downstream signaling pathways to TLRs recapitulates the effect
  of TLR-knockout on the promotion of K-ras driven lung cancer by COPD-like airway
  inflammation. Representative photomicrographs of lung immunohistochemistry that
  are positive for Ki-67 (A), and ERG (C) (20x magnification, scale bar=100um). Accompanied
  by quantitative analysis (right panels) represented as a percentage of positive
  Ki-67 (n=7-10) (B) and ERG cells (n=5-6) (D). Data represent mean ± SEM; experimental
  groups are separately compared to CC-LR cohort, where *p< 0.05 by unpaired t-test.

  airway inflammation on K-ras-driven lung cancer through activation of the MyD88/NF-ĸB
  pathway in the airway epithelium.
