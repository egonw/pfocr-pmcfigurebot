caption: 'The role of ROS in regulating immune cells. (a) Tumor cells: IFN-γ signaling
  downregulates the expression of xCT, thereby decreasing the synthesis of GSH. TGF-β
  signaling activates NADPH oxidase to increase ROS production. Oxidative damage ultimately
  leads to cancer cell death and induces ICD, resulting in significant production
  of tumor neoantigens. In addition, ROS can promote the expression of FGFR1 to activate
  the Akt signaling pathway, contributing to a significant increase in PD-L1 protein.
  (b) MDSCs: ROS generated by NOX2 induce a conformational change in Keap1 that releases
  nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). The activation of Nrf2 leads
  to the increased expression of GSH-transmitting PPP, and, subsequently, increased
  glutathione can affect MDSCs differentiation. (c) The stimulation of TCR induces
  the release of intracellular calcium ions to activate OXPHOS. ROS generated through
  OXPHOS then activate NF-kB and induce IL-2 expression, leading to enhanced T-cell
  proliferation. (d) DCs: ROS can affect antigen processing by regulating pH and inhibiting
  Cts (performing proteolytic activity at a specified pH), thereby affecting the binding
  of antigens to MHC molecules. (e) B cells: ROS participates in BCR signaling pathways,
  including PKC/NF-κB and PI3KA/mTOR.'
