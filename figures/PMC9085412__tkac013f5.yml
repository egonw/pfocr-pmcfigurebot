caption: 'The ERK pathway is predicted to be involved in the pathways downstream of
  HOXC6 in keloid fibroblasts. (a) Boxplot of the si-HOXC6-KF group and the si-NC-KF
  group. (b) Volcano plot of the distributions of all DEGs between the si-HOXC6-KF
  group and the si-NC-KF group, with red dots representing 92 significantly up-regulated
  genes and green dots representing 88 significantly down-regulated genes in the si-HOXC6-KF
  group. No significantly changed genes are marked as blue dots (25797). (c) Heatmap
  of si-HOXC6-KF group and si-NC-KF group. (d) Scatter diagram of the top twenty signaling
  pathways based on Reactome analysis. (e) Sort the top twenty pathways in Reactome
