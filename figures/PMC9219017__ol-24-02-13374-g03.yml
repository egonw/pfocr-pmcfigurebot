caption: FABP7 overexpression inhibits cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma growth in
  vivo. (A) Tumor growth curve in nude mice. (B) The tumor was photographed and weighed
  at 35 days post-inoculation. (C) Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was used
  to detect FABP7 expression levels in tumor tissues. (D) Immunohistochemistry was
  used to detect the protein expression levels of FABP7, Ki67, Notch 1 and Notch 3
  (Scale bar, 50 Âµm). **P<0.01 vs. NC. FABP7, fatty acid-binding protein 7; oe, overexpression
  vector; NC, negative control.
