caption: 'Comparison between the computational geometries of the binding of the Nrf2
  and PKLPs with a pocket of Keap1 protein: (a) Proposed schematic diagram of the
  Nrf2 signaling pathway mechanism of the PKLPs in the H2O2-induced Caco-2 cells;
  (b) Magnification of the interaction site of the Nrf2â€“Keap1 complex motif, and its
  binding geometry; (c) Magnification of the interaction between the Keap1 pocket
  and the PKLPs. Hydrogen bonds are represented by yellow dashed lines, and the related
  amino acid residues and peptides are highlighted in the picture.'
