caption: S1PR2 inhibits EC migration, proliferation, and angiogenic activity. A-D,
  S1PR2 inhibits the ability of migration of HUVECs, as shown by transwell chemotactic
  assay (A-B) and scratch wound healing assay (C-D) (n = 6). E, S1PR2 inhibits the
  ability of proliferation of HUVECs, as shown by MTT assay (n = 5). F-G, S1PR2 inhibits
  the ability of angiogenic sprouting of HUVECs, as shown by fibrin gel bead sprouting
  assay (n = 5). H-I, S1PR2 inhibits the ability of tube formation of HUVECs, as shown
  by tube formation assay (n = 5). Scale Bars, 200 μm. Data are mean ± SEM. n.s indicates
  not significant. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01.
