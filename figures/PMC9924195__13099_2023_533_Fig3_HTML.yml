caption: Proteomics analysis indicates that NEMO is involved in H. pylori-CMTM3-inflammation.
  a Differentially expressed proteins (P.adj < 0.05). b Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
  and Genomes. enrichment analysis. The TOP regulated signaling pathways were shown
  of CMTM3 KO vs control (LentiV2) in GES-1 cells (padj < 0.05). c Heat map of the
  expression levels of the differentially expressed proteins enriched in epithelial
  cell signaling in H. pylori infection signaling pathway. Red indicates high and
  blue indicates low protein expression. d NEMO expression was detected in CMTM3 KO
  GES-1 and HEK 293 T cells by western blotting. β-Actin was used as a control. Data
  are representative of three independent experiments. e NEMO expression was detected
  in CMTM3 KO GES-1 cells by qRT-PCR. Data is representative of three independent
  experiments. f Representative immunohistochemistry images of NEMO by human gastric
  tissues from the same patient before and after H. pylori infection (n = 11). g Summary
  of immunohistochemistry results for NEMO. Graph showing the average quantification
  of NEMO positive cells in at least 6 random fields of one patient. Data is expressed
  as means ± SEM. *p < 0.05. ns, no statistical difference
