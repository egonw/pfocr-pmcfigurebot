caption: Effect of the Ecklonia cava extract (ECE) on the mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway in MGO-induced mesangial cells. Cells were pretreated
  with ECE for 1 h, followed by incubation with 1 mM MGO for 24 h. The protein expression
  levels of MAPKs (extracellular signal-regulated kinase; ERK, c-Jun N terminal kinase;
  JNK, p38, and phosphorylated forms) were determined by Western blotting (A). p-ERK/ERK,
  p-JNK/JNK, and p-p38/p38 ratios (B–D). Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation
  (n = 3). Statistical analysis of the results was performed using one-way ANOVA followed
  by Tukey’s test (### p < 0.001 vs. control and *** p < 0.001 vs. MGO only).
