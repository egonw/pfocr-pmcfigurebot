caption: Pathway for the utilization of extracellular branched-chain amino acids (BCAA)
  for branched-chain fatty acid (BCFA) biosynthesis in S. aureus. Extracellular BCAA
  are transported into the cell by multiple BCAA transporters and the BCAA transaminase
  (IlvE) selectively converts Ile and Leu to their respective α-ketoacids. The branched-chain
  ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (Bkd) converts these α-ketoacids to their respective
  branched-chain acyl-CoAs. These acyl-CoAs are used by 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III
  (FabH) to initiate the bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis (FASII) elongation cycle
  to produce BCFA. Ile is the preferred substrate and Val is not a significant contributor
  to BCFA synthesis when Ile or Leu are present. Ile metabolism gives rise to anteiso
  odd-carbon number BCFA and Leu gives rise to iso odd-carbon BCFA. ACP, acyl carrier
  protein.
