caption: 'Abnormality of glutathione metabolism led to the reduction of fibroin protein.
  (A) Inhibition of glutathione metabolism pathway led to the accumulation of glutathione;
  (B) inhibition of glutathione metabolism pathway led to reduction of Gly and Ser;
  (C) the content of fibroin proteins decreased in BmAbl1-. N3: Nistari l5d3; A3:
  BmAbl-l5d3; N5: Nistari l5d5; A5: BmAbl-l5d5. Standard deviation was calculated
  by all biological replicates. * p < 0.01, ** p < 0.005, t-test.'
