caption: 'The PDGF family was involved in tumor metastasis of ovarian cancer. (a)
  Correlation analysis of individual gene expression of the PDGF family with pathway
  scores in ovarian cancer. The correlation between gene expression and the pathway
  was evaluated by Spearman''s correlation coefficient (R). (b) The mRNA expression
  levels of PDGFRA and PDGFRB in ovarian cancer patients with or without venous invasion.
  (c) The mRNA expression levels of PDGFRA and PDGFRB in ovarian cancer patients with
  or without lymphatic invasion. ∗, ∗∗: significantly different from the corresponding
  control group, P < 0.05, P < 0.01, respectively; ns: not significantly different
  from the corresponding control group (Wilcox test).'
