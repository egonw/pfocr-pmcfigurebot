caption: Three T-CMs regulated expression level of apoptosis-related proteins in HepG2
  cells. A, Protein expression of Bax, Bcl-2, Cyto c, full length Caspase-9, cleaved
  Caspase-9, full length Caspase-3, cleaved Caspase-3 and Actin in HepG2 cells after
  three T-CM treatments was performed by Western blot. B − G, The ratio of Bax/Bcl-2,
  Cyto c/Actin, full length Caspase-9/Actin, cleaved Caspase-9/Actin, full length
  Caspase-3/Actin, cleaved Caspase-3/actin by a under grayscale analysis was counted.
  Each result was expressed by Mean ± SD with four replicates and the lower case letters
  indicated P < 0.05.
