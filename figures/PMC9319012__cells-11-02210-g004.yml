caption: Role of RELA in cytoplasmic GFPT2 expression. (A) Scr or RELA siRNA-transfected
  hSAECs were mock-infected or RSV-infected. Cells were permeabilized and stained
  with anti-GFPT2 Ab (red). Nuclear stained is by DAPI (blue). Bar indicates 30 μm.
  (B) The quantitation of GFPT2 staining by FIJI. GFPT2 fluorescence was segmented
  by StarDist and plotted as arbitrary fluorescence/cell for each treatment condition.
  **, p < 0.01 by post-hoc Tukey comparison. (C) Flow cytometric quantification of
  GFPT2. GFPT2 fluorescence intensity was measured by flow cytometry. **, p < 0.01
  by post-hoc Tukey comparison.
