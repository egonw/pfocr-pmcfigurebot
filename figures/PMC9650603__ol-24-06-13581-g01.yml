caption: Protein interactions serve an important role in the loss or gain of FOXKs
  function. (A) FOXK2, as an important component of transcription co-inhibitory complex
  or transcription activation complex, inhibits or activates its target genes. (B)
  As a novel G/T mismatch DNA binding protein, FOXK2 serves an important role in determining
  the future of G/T mismatch DNA. (C) FOXK2 can bind to E1A and E6 viral proteins
  as a tumor suppressor protein. (D) FOXK2 acts as ERα and BARD1 scaffold protein
  and negatively regulates the expression of ERα and target genes. (E) FOXK2 interacts
  with DVL as a transfer protein and promotes nuclear translocation of DVL, which
  in turn activates the Wnt signaling pathway. FOXKs, Forkhead box K; ERα, estrogen
  receptor α; BARD1, BRCA1-associated RING domain protein 1.
