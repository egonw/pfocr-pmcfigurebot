caption: Metabolic pathways impacted by loss of PKCδ.A and B, pathway impact (>1.2
  fold compared to shNT cells, p < 0.1) was determined by comparing untargeted global
  metabolomics of Par-C5 cells depleted of PKCδ shδ110 (A) and shδ680 (B) cells to
  control cells (shNT). Pathway impact quantifies the number of metabolites that are
  present in a particular pathway following enrichment and pathway topology analysis.
  Shown are pathways with greater than 0.25 pathway impact score. Italicized and bolded
  pathway labels with teal bars are those shared between shδ110 and shδ680 depleted
  cells. C and D, steady state levels of individual metabolites from the nucleotide
  and amino acid pathways shown in A and B. Data is presented as fold change of shδ110 cells
  (black circle) or shδ680 cells (teal triangle) relative to shNT control. Error bars
  represent SEM from a representative experiment with triplicate biological replicates.
  PKCδ, protein kinase Cδ.
