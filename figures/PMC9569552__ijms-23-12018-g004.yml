caption: 'ZWB90-3-induced G2/M-phase arrest and interference in the microtubule arrangement.
  (A) HCC827 cells were treated with PBS (vehicle) or ZWB90-3 or Emi-IgG4 for 26 h,
  and total DNA contents were analyzed using flow cytometry. Numbers within the boxes
  are proportions to the G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases. (B) The curve of the change over
  time between groups in the G2/M phase (left). The time-course curve of the ZWB90-3-induced
  G2/M-phase arrest (middle). The dose–response curve of ZWB90-3-induced G2/M-phase
  arrest (right). (C) Immunofluorescence (IF) staining of α-tubulin in the vehicle
  and ZWB90-3-induced cells. Images were acquired at 100× or 200× magnification. Scale
  bars: 20 μm or 10 μm. (D) Western blot images, where α-tubulin and GAPDH served
  as the loading controls. ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001 were considered significant
  as compared to the vehicle control.'
