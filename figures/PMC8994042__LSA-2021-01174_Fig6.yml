figure_title: The Golgi trafficking defect observed in the presence of the 85-90 IFITM3
  mutant or of high levels of WT IFITM3 is relieved by Amphotericin B and v-SNARE
  overexpression
caption: '(A) HEK293T cells transfected with mEm.-VSV-G and 85-90 IFITM3 (or of WT
  IFITM3 expressed at low or high levels: 1 and 4 μg, representative pictures of WT
  IFITM3 at low concentrations are provided in the ) coding DNAs were either mock
  treated or treated with AmphoB at 1 μM for 18 h before confocal microscopy analysis.
  Representative images along with the cumulative analysis of the proportion of cells
  presenting the indicated VSV-G distributions (from 40 to 100 cells scored per condition
  in three independent experiments). *P-values of 0.002 and <0.0001 for WT-high and
  85-90, respectively, after unpaired two-tailed t tests between the indicated conditions.
  (B) HEK293T cells expressing constant amounts of 85-90 IFITM3 and mEm.-VSV-G were
  co-transfected with increasing amounts of GS15-CFP coding DNA, before confocal microscopy
  analysis (GS15/85-90 ratios of 0.2 and 0.5). Given that VSV-G accumulation in the
  Golgi leads to its asymmetrical perinuclear distribution in the cell, VSV-G fluorescence
  was determined for each cell according to the presented scheme. The fluorescence
  measured over distance in the cell was used to calculate the proportion of VSV-G
  protein present at one side (the left side was set as the side with higher protein
  accumulation). Representative pictures and graph presenting the distribution of
  VSV-G at one side of the cell in triple-positive cells (n = 2 with 20–31 cells analyzed
  per condition). White circles highlight examples of phenotypic differences in the
  perinuclear accumulation of VSV-G. ****P-value of <0.0001 following a one-way ANOVA,
  Tukey’s multiple comparisons test over 85-90 IFITM3 condition with no GS15-CFP.
