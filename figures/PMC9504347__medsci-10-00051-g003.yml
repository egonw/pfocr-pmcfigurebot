caption: Effect of mTOR knockdown on 4EBP1 phosphorylation. MCF-7 cells were seeded
  and grown to 50% in 6-well plate. Cells were then transfected with mTOR siRNA (30
  nM final concentration) for 48 h and 72 h, thereafter cells were harvested, (a)
  level of phosphorylated 4EBP1 was determined by SDS PAGE. β-actin was used as a
  loading control. (b) Gel densitometry tracing from (a) using ImageJ software. Ctrl
  represent untreated control. Values shown are mean ± range for two independent experiments.
