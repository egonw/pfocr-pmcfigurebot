caption: Kottayil et al. prepared a polyamine by the ring opening polymerization of
  epichlorohydrin and employed it for the synthesis of 2-arylbenzimidazoles from o-phenylenediamine
  and different aldehydes. Low catalyst loading, short reaction time, mild reaction
  conditions, high efficiency, simple work up and easy product purification, and recyclability
  of the catalyst are the salient features of the synthesis. A tentative reaction
  pathway was also illustrated ().
