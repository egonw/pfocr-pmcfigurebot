caption: GO and KEGG enrichment analyses of DEGs between the low and high SHMT2 in
  the TCGA HNC cohort. Genes with |log2Fold Change|> 1 and a p-value < 0.01 were defined
  as differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The up-regulated genes are marked in red,
  and the down-regulated genes are marked in blue. (A) Volcano plot of DEGs. (B,C)
  GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis results for DEGs. (D) The GSEA heat map
  shows differences in the expression of the core enrichment genes involved in the
  stem cell maintenance gene set between the patients with high and low SHMT2 expression.
  (E) Correlation between POU5F1 (OCT4) and SHMT2, (F) Correlation between SOX2 and
  SHMT2, (G) Correlation between ALDH1A1 and SHMT2, and (H) Correlation between FGF19
  and SHMT2. Differences were considered relevant at p < 0.05.
