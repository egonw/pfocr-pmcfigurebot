caption: 'Alterations in EGFR and the downstream MAPK/ERK pathway were associated
  with the development of multifocal lung tumours. (A) The developmental stage of
  the sampled tumours in each patient. EGFR driver mutations and the potential for
  metastasis in each patient are indicated by the bar below the image. Shared EGFR
  driver was defined as the same EGFR driver identified in more than two nodules of
  one patient. (B) Pathway analysis of somatic mutations in different developmental
  stages using the Mutations For Functional Impact on Network Neighbors (MUFFINN)
  method. (C) Immune‐related pathway analysis of multiple primary lung cancers (MPLCs)
  at different stages. GS tumours: genetically‐similar. GD tumours: genetically‐different'

  primary lung cancer.
