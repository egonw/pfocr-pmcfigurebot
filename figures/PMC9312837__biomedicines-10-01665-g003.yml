caption: Gene expression profiling of mutant cells. (A) Principal component analysis
  (PCA) and unsupervised clustering of MT (red) vs Ctrl cells (blue). (B) Heatmap
  diagram of two-way hierarchical clustering analysis of the 4943 probes, showing
  different expression levels with a p-value ≤ 0.05 and abs (FC) ≥ 1.5. Red and green
  colours represent an expression level above or lower than the mean, respectively.
  The X-axis represents samples with, from the left to the right, control cells compared
  to 98% MT cells (n = 4) while the Y-axis represents Illumina probes. (C) Volcano
  plot representation of the differentially expressed genes in a pairwise comparison
  of control vs 98% MT cells. The significant cut-off was set at a p-value ≤ 0.05
  and abs (FC) ≥ 1.5. Differentially expressed genes annotated as glutamate-glutamine
  metabolism, GABA, and TCA cycle in the REACTOME pathway database (see ) are labelled
  with their corresponding gene symbols.
