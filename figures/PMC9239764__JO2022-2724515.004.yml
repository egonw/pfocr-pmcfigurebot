caption: qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry of ARL4C expression in KIRC. (a-b) ARL4C
  mRNA expression in KIRC and normal kidney tissues (n = 42) was determined using
  qRT-PCR. (c-d) Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on KIRC and normal kidney
  tissues (n = 3) to determine the expression of ARL4C, and histograms of H-scores
  for three representative samples were generated. ∗∗∗P < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001.
