caption: Steamed PSPs attenuate D-gal-induced oxidative damage by regulating the HO-1/Nrf2
  signaling pathway. (A) MDA level in the serum (n = 8). (B,C) The upper panels show
  representative blots of Nrf2/β-actin and HO-1/β-actin, while the lower panel shows
  Nrf2/β-actin and HO-1/β-actin quantification data (n = 6). Data are expressed as
  means ± SEM. * p < 0.05.
