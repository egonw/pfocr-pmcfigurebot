caption: ASEBA subtest (3A) and composite scales (3B) for TT1 patients, PKU patients,
  and healthy controls. Data are presented with min–max whisker plots. Higher scores
  indicate more problems. Statistical differences between the groups after Benjamini–Hochberg
  correction are depicted as *. Due to missing questions/questionnaires, the number
  of patients on the scales varied between 29 and 30 for TT1 patients. Thirty‐one
  PKU patients and 54 healthy controls were included for all scales.
