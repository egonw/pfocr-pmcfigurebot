figure_title: Model for Fas/FasL regulating mROS and IFN-γ production after IL-12/IL-18
  stimulation
caption: Left, IL-12/IL-18 stimulation triggers mitochondria activation and mROS production,
  which activate the pathway leading to IFN-γ expression. Fas/FasL interaction leads
  to cytochrome C release, which controls mitochondrial activity and mROS production
  [] and, consequently, IFN-γ. Caspase-3 is located outside of mitochondria [], but
  there is no apoptosis induction in response to IL-12/IL-18. Right, In absence of
  Fas, cytochrome C is retained in mitochondria and mROS production is increased.
  Fas deficiency provokes caspase-3 translocation to mitochondria after IL-12/IL-18
  stimulation, which might further increase mROS production []. Overall, increased
  mROS production results in IFN-γ hyperproduction in absence of Fas/FasL interaction.
article_title: Mitochondrial reactive oxygen is critical for IL-12/IL-18-induced IFN-γ
  production by CD4+ T cells and is regulated by Fas/FasL signaling.
