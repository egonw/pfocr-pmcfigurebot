caption: '(A–C) Metabolomics analysis of serum from ALS and controls. (A) Score scatter
  plot based on the OPLS-DA models from serum to explain the diagnosis, with R2X =
  0.452, R2Y = 0.477, Q2 = 0.269 and p < 0.035 for the CV-ANOVA test (blue: controls;
  green: ALS). (B) Loading scatter plot presenting the top 15 metabolites identified
  by the OPLS-DA. The horizontal axis displays the X-loadings p and the Y-loadings
  q of the predictive component. The vertical axis displays the X-loadings p(o) and
  the Y-loadings s(o) for the Y-orthogonal component. X-variables situated in the
  vicinity of the dummy Y-variables have the highest discriminatory power between
  the classes. The eight metabolites that had VIP scores higher than 1 are written
  in blue. (C) Pathway analysis with the 15 VIP metabolites highlighted alterations
  in arginine biosynthesis (p = 0.006), alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism
  (p = 0.02), biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids (p = 0.04) and linoleic acid
  metabolism (p = 0.04). Each node represents a metabolite set with its color based
  on its p-value and its size based on the pathway impact. The complete list of metabolic
  pathways is described in . (D–F) Metabolomics analysis of muscle from ALS and controls.
  (A) Univariate volcano plot analysis revealed different metabolites in the muscle
  metabolome from ALS patients and control subjects. Metabolites identified on the
  left are decreased in ALS patients compared to controls, while metabolites on the
  right of the diagram are increased in ALS patients. (B) Score scatter plot based
  on the OPLS-DA models from muscle to explain the diagnosis, with R2X = 0.76, R2Y
  = 0.555, Q2 = 0.446 and p < 0.0012 for the CV-ANOVA test (blue: controls; green:
  ALS). (C) Loading scatter plot presenting the top 15 metabolites identified by the
  OPLS-DA. The five metabolites that had VIP score higher than 1 are written in blue.
  (D) Pathway analysis with the 15 VIP metabolites highlighted alterations in the
  metabolism of glycine, serine and threonine (p < 0.001); biosynthesis (p = 0.002)
  and degradation (p = 0.04) of valine, leucine and isoleucine; aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis
  (p = 0.007) and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism (p = 0.03). The complete
  list of metabolic pathways is described in .'
