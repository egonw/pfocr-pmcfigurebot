caption: Cluster analysis of differentially changed metabolites in Pohlia nutans under
  OPDA treatment. (A) Heatmap showing the differentially changed metabolites (DCMs)
  sorted by metabolite classes under OPDA treatment. (B) KEGG enrichment analysis
  of DCMs between two groups. Rich factor represents the ratio of the DCMs amount
  to the total amount of annotated metabolites in the pathway. (C) Chord diagram showing
  the correlation among DCMs identified by Pearson correlation analysis. The outer
  layer is the metabolite identifier. The point size in the middle layer represents
  the log2(Fold Change) value. The inner line reflects the Pearson correlation coefficient
  (r) between metabolites. Positive correlation is represented by the red line, while
  negative correlation is represented by the blue line. The differential metabolite
  pairs with |r| â‰¥ 0.8 and p < 0.05 were charted.
