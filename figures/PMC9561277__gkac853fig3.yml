caption: The APE1 N33 motif is required for ATR–Chk1 DDR pathway in vivo and in vitro.
  (A) Overexpression of WT but not △N33 tGFP-APE1 nor tGFP activated Chk1 phosphorylation
  in PANC1 cells. APE1 or N33-depletion over-expression plasmid was transfected to
  PANC1 cells. After 1-day incubation of various overexpression plasmid transfection,
  different doses of doxycycline (0, 10 or 50 μg/ml) were added to PANC1 cells for
  another 2 days. Total cell lysates were then extracted and analyzed via immunoblotting
  analysis. (B) △N33 tGFP-APE1 was deficient in nuclear localization in PANC1 cells.
  tGFP, WT or △N33 tGFP-APE1 overexpression plasmid was transfected to PANC1 cells.
  After 1-day incubation of overexpression plasmid transfection, 50 μg/ml doxycycline
  was added to PANC1 cells for another 2 days, followed with fluorescence microscopy
  analysis. Scale bars = 10 μm. (C) Chk1 phosphorylation was triggered by the excess
  addition of recombinant His-APE1 protein in a dose-dependent manner in PANC1 nuclear
  extracts. Different doses of His-APE1 protein were added to PANC1 nuclear extracts
  for incubation for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were analyzed via immunoblotting
  analysis as indicated. (D) Chk1 phosphorylation induced by excess addition of recombinant
  His-APE1 protein in PANC1 nuclear extracts was independent of its nuclease activity
  and redox function. WT or mutant (i.e. D308A, C65A, E96Q, ED) His-APE1 was added
  to PANC1 nuclear extracts for 30-min incubation at room temperature, followed by
  immunoblotting analysis. (E) Pulldown assays suggest that WT/mutant His-APE1 associated
  with ATR, ATRIP and RPA32 in PANC1 nuclear extracts. ‘Input’ or ‘Pulldown’ samples
  were examined via immunoblotting analysis as indicated. (F) Chk1 phosphorylation
  induced by WT His-APE1-YFP protein in PANC1 nuclear extracts was inhibited by VE-822
  but not KU55933 nor NU7441 (1 mM). (G) Chk1 phosphorylation was activated by excess
  addition of WT His-APE1-YFP but not △N33 His-APE1-YFP protein in PANC1 nuclear extracts.
  (H) Pulldown assays suggest that WT but not △N33 His-APE1-APE1 associated with ATR,
  ATRIP and RPA32 in PANC1 nuclear extracts pre-treated with DNase I (2 mg/ml). ‘Input’
  or ‘Pulldown’ samples were examined via immunoblotting analysis as indicated. (A,
  C, D, G) Chk1-P-S345/Chk1 was quantified and examined as means ± SD (n = 3).
