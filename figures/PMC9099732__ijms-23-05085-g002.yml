caption: 'Identification and validation of metabolomic markers relevant for the assignment
  of patients to the correct pain phenotype subgroups. (A): Results of the variable
  selection procedure performed as random forest-based Boruta analysis, which assesses
  the measure of importance of a variable based on the decrease in classification
  accuracy due to random permutation of values in a 100-fold cross-validated approach.
  The importance measure is calculated separately for all trees in the forest that
  use the respective feature for classification. Then the mean value and the standard
  deviation of the loss of accuracy are calculated and the z-score is used in comparison
  to an external reference, the so-called “shadow” features (empty boxes), obtained
  by permuting the values of the original feature. Green and yellow boxes represent
  “confirmed” or tentatively significant features, respectively, i.e., features that
  contribute to the classification success and were selected for the validation analyses
  shown in the lower line of panels. The red boxes are confirmed as non-informative
  variables and excluded from further analysis. The boxes were constructed using the
  minimum, quartiles, median (solid line inside the box), and maximum of these values.
  The whiskers add 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) to the 75th percentile
  or subtract 1.5 times the IQR from the 25th percentile. The black circles indicate
  outliers from this interval. (B): Results of the Boruta feature selection analysis
  when instead of the original data, randomly permuted metabolic marker concentrations
  were used. The figure was created using the R software package (version 4.0.2 for
  Linux; https://CRAN.R-project.org/ []) and the R libraries “Boruta” (https://cran.r-project.org/package=Boruta
  []) and “ggplot2” (https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggplot2 []).'
