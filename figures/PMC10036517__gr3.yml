caption: 'Fatty acid synthesis in R. toruloides. (A) Brief synthesis pathway of predicted
  major fatty acid components with corresponding elongase (blue) and desaturases (red).
  Among the synthesis of linoleic acid by the phosphatidylcholine pathway (dotted
  line), the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine and hydrolysis of the linoleoyl chain
  from phosphatidylcholine are not illustrated. The activity of thioesterase removing
  CoA from each acyl-CoA chain is not illustrated. (B) Lipid production under different
  media. Lipid titer (red, left axis) and content (black, right axis) were calculated.
  (C) The relative fraction of each fatty acid under different media. YS+Glu: YS with
  glucose as carbon source; YS+Gly: YS with glycerol as carbon source.'
