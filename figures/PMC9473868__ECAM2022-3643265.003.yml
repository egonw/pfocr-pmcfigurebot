caption: 'Regulation of BAI on the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in SW982 cells.
  (a) PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway-associated proteins were detected by western
  blotting in BAI-treated SW982 cells. (b) Quantitative data for (a). ∗P < 0.05 and
  ∗∗P < 0.01, vs. 0 μM BAI group; #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01, vs. 15 μM BAI group; &P
  < 0.05 and &&P < 0.01, vs. 25 μM BAI group. n = 3.'
