caption: 'Metabolic reprogramming in CD8+ T‐cell activation and memory formation.
  (A) Metabolic changes in CD8+ T cells upon activation. Upon antigen recognition,
  stimulatory signals T‐cell receptor (TCR) and costimulation CD28 induce the activation
  of PI3K‐AKT pathway, mTOR, and the calcium release in the cytosol. This pathway
  result in the upregulation of the transcription factors NFAT and Myc that promote
  glycolysis and glutaminolysis. (B) Metabolic regulation during memory CD8+ T‐cell
  formation. After antigen clearance, mTORC1 is inhibited which leads to the downregulation
  of aerobic glycolysis. Fatty acids are used as main substrates for energy production:
  fatty acids enter the mitochondria through CPT1‐α and are transformed in acetyl‐CoA
  by fatty‐acid oxidation. Acetyl‐CoA enters then the tricarboxylic acid cycle to
  support the oxidative phosphorylation and energy production. Mitochondrial fitness
  is also closely regulated by proteins involved in mitophagy like Nix and also by
  inner mitochondrial membrane protein Optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) that promotes mitochondrial
  fusion.'
