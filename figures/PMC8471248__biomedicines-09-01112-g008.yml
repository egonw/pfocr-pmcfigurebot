caption: Proposed pathway for HG-induced α2M*/csGRP78 mediated profibrotic signaling
  in MCs. HG leads to increased synthesis (likely by HG-responsive transcription factors,
  but this has yet to be elucidated as indicated by “?” in the figure) and activation
  of α2M as well as translocation to the cell surface of its receptor GRP78. Interaction
  between α2M*/csGRP78 leads to activation of Akt and downstream synthesis of profibrotic
  cytokines and extracellular matrix proteins.
