caption: 'Natural products regulate the modulation of the Notch signaling pathway
  in BC. The Notch receptor is cleaved by Notch ligands, including Jagged-1. ADAM-10
  initially cleaves the Notch extracellular domain; the gamma–secretase complex then
  cleaves the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). NICD moves into the nucleus and initiates
  transcription. MAML: mastermind-like protein; EGCG: epigallocatechin-3-gallate;
  RBP-Jκ: recombinant signal binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region; DATS:
  diallyl trisulfide; ADAM-10: a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing
  protein 10; NICD: Notch receptor intracellular domain. This figure is reproduced
