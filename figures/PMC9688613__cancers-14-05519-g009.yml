caption: Anti-tumour effects of CLEFMA in vivo. Mice (n = 5) were orally administrated
  with either vehicle (control group) or CLEFMA (0.2 or 0.4 mg/kg) after SCC-9 cells
  were subcutaneously implanted. Tumour growth was then analysed. (A) After 27 days,
  the mice images were taken. (B) Tumour volume at each time interval during the experiment.
  (C) Average body weight of the mice during the treatment of CLEFMA. (D) Representative
  tumours isolated from mice. (E) Average tumour weight at the end of the treatment.
  (F) Immunohistochemistry to examine Ki-67 in SCC-9 tumours. (G) Immunofluorescence
  analysis of Ki-67 in SCC-9 cell lines. * p < 0.05 compared with the vehicle group.
