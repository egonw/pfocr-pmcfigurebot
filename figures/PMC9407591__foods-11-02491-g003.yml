caption: Schematic diagram of the metabolic pathway of FRT10 intervention in obesity
  according to metabolites analysis of liver and cecum contents. Blue indicated the
  presence of metabolites in the liver, red indicated the presence of metabolites
  in cecum contents, and green indicated the presence of metabolites in both liver
  and cecum contents. ↑ indicated an upward trend and ↓ indicated a downward trend.
  DAG—diglyceride; TG—triacylglycerols; SAM—S-adenosylmethionine; SAH—S-adenosine
  homocysteine; PC—phosphatidylcholine; PA—phosphatidic acid; PS—phosphatidylserine;
  PE—phosphatidylethanolamine.
