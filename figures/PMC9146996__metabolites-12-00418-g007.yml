caption: 'Searching for pathways of sphingolipid metabolism in the genome of L. gormanii
  ATCC 33297. (A) Mapping the L. gormanii ATCC 33297 genome annotation to the KEGG
  sphingolipid metabolism pathway map (map00600). Chemical compounds are represented
  as circles, and gene products are represented as rectangles. The two important entry
  enzymes in the pathway: serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT, EC 2.3.1.50, K00654) and
  sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase (SMPD1, 3.1.4.12, K12350) are outlined in red. Green
  rectangles represent enzymes found in the genome of L. gormanii ATCC 33297 via KofamKOALA
  and with assigned KO identifiers. For the first step of sphingolipid synthesis,
  i.e., condensation between serine and the acyl-CoA thioester, no SPT enzyme was
  found in the L. gormanii ATCC 33297 genome, based on the standard thresholds for
  KO identification. However, there are sequences encoding SPT protein homologues
  (8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase, locus tag: A8O30_RS00250; 2-amino-3-oxobutyrate
  coenzyme A ligase, locus tag: A8O30_RS04185) present, belonging to the bacterial
  α-oxoamine synthases family. In the case of SMPD1, which catalyzes the breakdown
  of sphingomyelin into ceramide and phosphatidylcholine, although KO identification
  failed to assign this function, the homologue of predicted sphingomyelinase encoded
  by the lpp2641 L. pneumophila str. Paris gene with a level of identity of 61% was
  found in the L. gormanii ATCC 33297 genome. (B) Multiple protein sequence alignment
  of reference bacterial SPT from Sphingomonas paucimobilis (Q93UV0_SPHPI) and SPT
  homologues present in the genome of L. gormanii ATCC 33297. The color-coded bar
  at the top indicates the conservation degree. Below, there is the consensus sequence.
  In addition, the recognized Pfam domain (Pfam_Aminotran_1_2) is marked with a green
  rectangle, which indicates the presence of certain mechanistic features, such as
  the covalent binding of the pyridoxal-phosphate group to a lysine residue. The level
  of identity between Sphingomonas paucimobilis SPT and L. gormanii ATCC 33297 homologues
  is at the level of 30%. The alignment was generated using the Multiple Sequence
  Comparison by Log-Expectation (MUSCLE) algorithm in SnapGene (GSL Biotech). (C)
  Comparison of genomic regions encoding SMPD1 between in L. pneumophila str. Paris
  and L. gormanii ATCC33297. The individual coding sequences are marked with arrows
  according to their orientation. Above is the locus tag for the individual coding
  sequence in the GenBank database. The color lines joining the two regions indicate
  the level of identity above the designated threshold (0.22) for specific proteins.
  There are four CDSs with significant similarity within the analyzed regions coding
  for SGNH/GDSL hydrolase (violet), sphingomyelinase (red), D-alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidase
  (green), and ParB partition protein (green). This may indicate a common evolutionary
  origin of SMPD1 in these species. The comparison and visualization were made using
  the clinker tool.'
