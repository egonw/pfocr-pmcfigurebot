caption: Inhibition of Aβ42-induced inflammatory response by Maackiain. PC12 cells
  were stimulated by different doses of Maackiain (10, 20, and 50 μM) for 6 hours
  and then exposed to 10 μM Aβ42 for additional 24 hours, followed by immunoblotting
  of the p65 levels in nuclear and cytoplasm (a). TNF-α (b) and IL-1β (c) levels in
  the supernatant were determined by ELISA. ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01.
