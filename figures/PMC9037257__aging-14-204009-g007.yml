  (A–C) Western blot to detect the expression of NRF2 and HO-1 protein and protein
  quantitative analysis; (D, E) Immunofluorescence evaluation of NRF2 expression and
  fluorescence quantification analysis; (F, G) Western blot to detect the expression
  of NRF2, HO-1, Acsl4 and Gpx4 protein and quantitative protein analysis; (H, I)
  Immunofluorescence to evaluate the expression of NRF2 and quantitative fluorescence
  analysis; (J–L) Fe2+, MDA and GSH measurement; (M) CCK8 method is used to assess
  cell viability; (N) PI staining of neuronal cells; (O) Quantification of PI positive
  cells. *p < 0.05 compared with the Control group or Erastin+Trehalose group, #p
  < 0.05 compared with the Erastin group.'
