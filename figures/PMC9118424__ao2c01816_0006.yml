caption: Analysis of DAMs and DEGs in E. adenophorum. (A–C) DAMs identified in the
  phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway, DAMs identified in the flavonoid metabolic pathway,
  and DAMs identified in the sesquiterpene metabolic pathway, respectively. (Red and
  blue circles indicate that the contents of metabolites in the stem metabolism group
  are up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, compared to the content in the
  blade metabolism group (VIP > 1).) The circle size indicates the difference multiple
  (FC). (D) Protein interaction of differential genes in the metabolic pathways of
  allelochemicals. (E) Correlation network analysis among six differential sensing
  substances. Purple circles represent DAMs involved in phenylpropanoid metabolism,
  yellow circles represent DMAs involved in flavonoid metabolism, and green circles
  represent DMAs involved in sesquiterpene metabolism. The round and triangular borders
  represent the up- and down-regulation of metabolites, respectively. Red and blue
  lines represent positive (PPC > 0) and negative (PPC < 0) correlations of metabolites
  with genes. (F–H) Correlation network diagrams of phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway
  DAMs and DEGs, flavonoid metabolic pathway DAMs and DEGs, and sesquiterpene metabolic
  pathway DAMs and DEGs. Circles and pentagons represent genes and metabolites, respectively.
  Pink circles represent DEGs involved in phenylpropanoid metabolism, yellow circles
  represent DEGs involved in brass metabolism, and brown circles represent DEGs involved
  in sesquiterpene metabolism. Red and black borders indicate the up- and down-regulation
  of genes and metabolites, respectively. Red and black lines represent metabolites
  and genes that are positively correlated (PPC > 0) and negatively correlated (PPC
  < 0), respectively.
