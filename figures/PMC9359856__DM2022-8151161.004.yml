caption: 'Relative levels of mTOR, p-mTOR, and p-mTOR/mTOR. (a) Western blot assays
  for the expressions of mTOR and p-mTOR. (b) There was no significant difference
  in the expression level of mTOR protein between the groups (p > 0.05). (c and d)
  The phosphorylation level of mTOR in the mimic miRNA-29a-3p group was the highest,
  while in the inhibitor miRNA-29a-3p group, the phosphorylation level of mTOR was
  the lowest. The trend of p-mTOR/mTOR ratio is the same as that of p-mTOR (∗∗∗: p
  < 0.001).'
