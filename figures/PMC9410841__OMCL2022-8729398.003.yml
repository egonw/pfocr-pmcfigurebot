caption: 'Effects of COG1410 on the neurological functions at 72 h after cerebral
  I/R. (a) Escape latency of mice in the training trials. (b) Frequency of platform
  crossing in the probe trial. (c) Percentage of time spent in the target quadrant
  in the probe trial. (d) Swimming speed in the probe trial. (e) Swimming trajectory
  of mice of each group in the probe trial. Data were represented as mean ± SEM (n
  = 8). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. sham group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 vs. I/R + Vehicle
  group.'
