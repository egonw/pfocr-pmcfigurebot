caption: Cell-cycle analysis and mitochondrial ROS analysis in CRHF2-treated cells.
  (a) Cell-cycle analysis of sub-G1 cell population. PM affected cell-cycle progression
  and it was recovered with CHRF2 treatment. Cells were treated with CRHF2 and induced
  with PM. Harvested cells were evaluated via flow cytometer. (b) Mitochondrial ROS
  analysis by DHR123 staining. Triplicated independent experiments (n = 3) were involved
  to confirm the repeatability. Results are represented as mean Â± SD; ** p < 0.01.
  (# denotes significance compared to control while * represents significance compared
  to PM-treated group).
