caption: Tregs with diminished RA signaling have higher metabolic activity. Purified
  WT and DNC Tregs were activated overnight with anti-CD3/CD28 mAbs in the presence
  of IL-2. A Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) of cellular untargeted
  metabolomics data from control and DNC Treg. Intracellular metabolites distinguished
  DNC Treg from controls. The green crosses represented DNC Treg and the red triangles
  represented the control Treg in the two-dimensional PLS-DA score plots. Each symbol
  represents metabolomics data from a pool of n = 3–4 mice. B Heatmap of differentially
  expressed metabolic features by WT and DNC Tregs. Each row represents data for a
  metabolic feature and each column represents an individual mouse. Different colors
  correspond to the different intensity level of metabolic features. Red and blue
  colors represent increased and decreased levels of metabolic features, respectively.
  C Pathway analysis of the untargeted metabolomics data sets for all samples was
  performed using mummichog 1.0. Significantly altered pathways are shown. D Modular
  analysis using mummichog 1.0 indicates highly upregulated purine and pyrimidine
  metabolism. Upregulated (red) and downregulated (blue) metabolites are shown. The
  size of the node is inversely proportional to p-value. E Oxygen consumption rate
  (OCR) of overnight activated Tregs was measured at basal level and in response to
  oligomycin, FCCP, and rotenone and antimycin in a mitostress test by Seahorse extracellular
  flux analyzer. F Extra cellular acidification rates (ECAR) of activated Tregs was
  determined in response to glucose, oligomycin, and 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) in a
  glycolysis stress test by Seahorse extracellular flux analyzer. n = 6/group. E,
  F Data shown is representative of at least two independent experiments
