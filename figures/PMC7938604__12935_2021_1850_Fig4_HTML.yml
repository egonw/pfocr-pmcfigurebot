caption: Enrichment plots from the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). GSEA results
  showing the apoptosis (a), cell cycle (b), ErbB signaling pathway (c), MAPK signaling
  pathway (d), mTOR signaling pathway (e), Notch signaling pathway (f), p53 signaling
  pathway (g),and TGF-beta signaling pathway (h). Multiple GSEA enrichment plots (i)
  of genes that are differentially enriched in CDCA8-related liver cancer. NES, normalized
  enrichment score; ES, enrichment score; FDR, false discovery rate
