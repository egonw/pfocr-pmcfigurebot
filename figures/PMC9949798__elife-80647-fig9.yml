figure_title: SLC38A2 protects mIMCD3 cells from ferroptosis under hyperosmotic stress
  by activating mTORC1
caption: (A) Inhibitory effect of hyperosmolarity on the mTORC1 signalling pathway.
  mIMCD3 cells were incubated with hyperosmotic solutions for 12 h. Western blotting
  analysis showed that hyperosmolarity suppressed the total and phosphorylated S6
  and 4E-BP1 expression in a dose-dependent manner. (B and C) MTT assay results showing
  that rapamycin (B) or torin-1 (C) sensitised mIMCD3 cells to erastin-induced ferroptosis
  under hyperosmolality. mIMCD3 cells were treated with rapamycin or torin-1 at various
  doses for 24 h. During the last 12 h, the cells were treated with or without erastin
  (10 μM) in the presence or absence of hyperosmolarity (600 mOsm). n=8. (D) The mTORC1
  inhibitors, rapamycin and torin-1, reduced the activity of glutathione peroxidase
  (GPx) activity. The cells were treated with rapamycin (10 nM) or torin-1 (10 nM)
  for 24 h, with or without hyperosmotic treatment in the final 12 h. n=6. (E) Cytometry
  assay showing that rapamycin and torin-1 significantly increased the levels of lipid
  reactive oxygen species (ROS). n=3. (F) Western blotting assay results demonstrating
  that SLC38A2 overexpression reversed hyperosmolarity-suppressed expression of total
  and phosphorylated S6 and 4E-BP1. The cells were infected with Ad-SLC38A2 or Ad-GFP
  for 36 h followed by hyperosmotic stress for 12 h. (G–H) MTT assay results showing
  that rapamycin (G) and torin-1 (H) completely abolished the protective effect of
  SLC38A2 in mIMCD3 cells under hyperosmolarity. After being infected with the adenoviruses,
  the cells were treated with rapamycin (10 nM) or torin-1 (10 nM) for 24 h with or
  without hyperosmolarity in the last 12 h. n=9–12. Data are means ± SEM; two-way
  ANOVA tests for B and C; one-way ANOVA tests for D, E, G, and H. See numerical source
