caption: Co-ordination of retrograde signaling and growth by ANAC017, MKK9, and MPK3/6.
  MPK3, MPK6, and MKK9 are regulators of the mitochondrial dysfunction response (A,
  B, and C). The induction of genes after AA treatment is attenuated in mpk3, mpk6
  (A), and mkk9 (B) mutant lines, while the apparent diminished response of these
  genes in the MKK9DD line (B) is based on their already elevated expression due to
  induction by DEX, confirming a MKK9-dependent induction of these genes (C). Seedlings
  were pretreated with NA-PP1 to deactivate MPK3/MPK6 function (A) or DEX to induce
  MKK9DD expression (B and C) 12 h before subsequent treatment with AA or water. Samples
  were then taken at the indicated timepoints for RNA extraction and RT–qPCR. Given
  are the means of the ΔΔCt ± se values (AA versus control) (B) and relative transcript
  abundance expressed as means of 40−ΔCt ± se values (C) of three biological replicates.
  D, ANAC017 directly binds to the promoters of TFs involved in the regulation of
  growth, senescence and stress responses. Shown are genome browser representations
  of ChIP-seq reads derived from a transgenic line expressing a GFP-ANAC017 fusion
  protein after treatment with AA, MT and water (control). Green bars indicate the
  position and orientation of the full-length cDNA. E, Model for the integration of
  retrograde signaling with plant growth by the direct action of ANAC017, an MKK9–MPK3/6
  signaling cascade, and the auxin/ethylene interaction. While ANAC017 directly induces
  the expression of stress genes such as AOX1A, NDB2, or OGO, it also activates in
  parallel components of the ethylene (MKK9, ACS2, ERF8, SAMDC) and auxin (YUC5, UGT74E2,
  ABCB4, IAA16) pathways. EIN3 also targets AOX1A, NDB2, and MKK9, allowing for dual
  regulation by the two TFs, while HRE2 binds to the promoters of AOX1A and OGO. In
  addition, the targeting of other TF genes such as ANAC081, bZIP60, and RCD1 by ANAC017
  allows for the activation of further transcriptional cascades to fine-tune and balance
  the acute stress response with plant growth and also a negative feedback loop via
  RCD1. Genes associated with steps in the pathway and directly targeted by ANAC017
  are highlighted in red (ordered by the statistical significance; ), while genes
  dually targeted by ANAC017 and EIN3 or HRE2 are highlighted in blue. Reciprocal
  interaction of ethylene and auxin is indicated by orange arrows. See text for details.
