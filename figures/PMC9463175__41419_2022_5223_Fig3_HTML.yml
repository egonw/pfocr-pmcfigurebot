figure_title: ZNF276 promoted cell migration and invasion
caption: A, B The effect of ZNF276 overexpression on breast cancer cell migration
  (A) and invasion (B) detected by transwell assay in MDA-MB-231. Bar = 100 µm. C
  Migrated distance of MDA-MB-231 cells induced by ZNF276 transfection was measured
  from 0 h to 48 h. Bar = 200 µm. D–F The effect of ZNF276 overexpression on breast
  cancer cell migration and invasion were also measured in SK-BR-3 by transwell migration
  (D), transwell invasion (E) and wound healing assay (F). G, H Migration (G) and
  invasion (H) abilities of MCF-7 cells was reduced by ZNF276 knockdown using siRNA.
  Bar = 100 µm. I Migrated distance of MCF-7 cells induced by siZNF276 transfection
  was measured from 0 h to 48 h. Bar = 200 µm. J, K Migration (J) and invasion (K)
  abilities of UACC-812 cells was reduced by ZNF276 knockdown using sgRNA. Bar = 100 µm.
  L Cell migration of UACC-812 cells attenuated by sgZNF276 was determined by wound
  healing assay. Bar = 200 µm. M Comparison of the number of pulmonary metastatic
  nodules in mice injected with ZNF276 overexpressing cells and the control cells.
  N Bioluminescent Image analysis of mouse lungs dissected after necropsy. IOD, integral
  optical density. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.
