caption: Neuroimaging biomarker placement on the causal pathway. (A) In ideal circumstances,
  the surrogate measure resides in the causal pathway capturing relevant disease processes
  represented by the clinical end point. (B) Potential stroke biomarkers derived from
  functional MRI (fMRI), EEG and MEG reflect underlying plasticity events occurring
  during spontaneous and/or treatment-induced recovery that positively or negatively
  affect stroke recovery outcomes. Figure adapted from Fleming and DeMets.
