caption: FBXW7 negatively regulates ACTL6A stability via the ubiquitin-proteasome
  pathway. (a) RT-qPCR analysis of ACTL6A transcript level in MHCC-97H and Huh7 cells.
  (b) The above cells were incubated with MG132 (10 μM) for 12 h, and total protein
  was extracted and subjected to Western blot. (c–f) MHCC-97H and Huh7 cells were
  treated with CHX (50 μg/mL), harvested, and immunoblotted for ACTL6A and GAPDH.
  Quantification of the ACTL6A protein levels relative to GAPDH expression. Graph
  represents mean ± SD; ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01.
