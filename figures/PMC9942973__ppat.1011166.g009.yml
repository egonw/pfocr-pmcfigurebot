figure_title: A working model for HCMV-induced SOCS3 upregulation in NPCs
caption: HCMV-encoded pUL97 activates RFX7 by phosphorylation in infected NPCs. The
  activated RFX7 upregulates SOCS3 transcription through its promoter. Elevated SOCS3
  expression suppresses the IL6-JAK-STAT pathway. This blockage disrupts NPCâ€™s response
  to extracellular neurodevelopment cues and consequently results in impaired self-renewal,
  proliferation, and migration of NPCs.
