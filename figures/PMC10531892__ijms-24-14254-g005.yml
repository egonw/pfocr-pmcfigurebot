caption: 'Efficiency of CD14+ monocyte differentiation to tumor-associated macrophages
  (TAMs). (A,B) Microscopic examination. (A) The figure shows freshly isolated and
  undifferentiated CD14+ monocytes characterized by relatively small size, with a
  spherical and smooth surface. (B) Differentiated TAMs morphology was observed on
  day 7 after culturing monocytes with culture media, tumor-conditioned media, IL-10,
  IL-4, and MCSF. Examination showed morphological changes; cells became relatively
  larger in size with edgy and rough surfaces confirming TAMs differentiation. (C,D)
  Flow cytometric analysis utilizing anti-CD163 FITC. (C) Freshly isolated undifferentiated
  CD14+ monocytes showed low CD163 positivity (1.38%). (D) After seven days of culturing
  monocytes with culture media, tumor-conditioned media, IL-10, IL-4, and MCSF, flow
  cytometry showed a 14-fold increase in CD163 positivity (19.50%) compared to that
  of undifferentiated CD14+ monocytes confirming efficient TAMs differentiation. TAMs:
  tumor-associated macrophages; BC: breast cancer; IL-10: interleukin-10; IL-4: interleukin-4;
  MCSF: macrophage-colony stimulating factor.'
