caption: 'Serum levels of related factors in different groups: WT, ALK4-NC, ALK4-NC+I/R,
  and ALK4-KO+I/R groups. (a) The hydroxylamine method was used to detect SOD level
  at 24 h after I/R. (b) The thiobarbituric acid method was employed to detect MDA
  level at 24 h after I/R. (c–e) Serum levels of CK, LDH, and AST were assessed with
  corresponding ELISA kits at 24 h after I/R. (f–h) Inflammation related factors (IL-6,
  TNF-α, and IL-1β) were detected with corresponding ELISA kits at 24 h after I/R.
  (i and j) The serum levels of PG12 and TXA2 were detected with corresponding ELISA
  kits at 24 h after I/R. (k) Representative images of nonischemic zones (blue) and
  infracted tissue (white) within the AAR (absence of blue dye). Data are expressed
  as mean ± SD. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001, WT+I/R group vs. WT+sham
  group. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, and ###P < 0.001, ALK4+/-+I/R group vs. WT+I/R group.'
