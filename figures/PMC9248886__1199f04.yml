caption: 'Exposomeâ€“proteome interactions: proteins and signaling pathways that were
  significantly correlated with the exposome. (A) Spearman''s correlation analysis
  between the exposome and proteome (|r| > 0.9; Q-value < 0.05). Only the proteins
  with degrees > 5 are shown. The complete network is provided in Supplemental Figure
  S5. (B) Signaling pathways that significantly correlated with the exposome revealed
  by pathway analysis using KEGG, GO, and Reactome databases. Immune-related pathways
  are shown in bold. (C) Spearman''s correlation networks between chemicals, top 20
  biological exposome components, immune-related proteins, and signaling pathways
  (|r| > 0.9; Q-value < 0.05), with positive correlations shown in blue and negative
  correlations shown in red. A detailed network for each pathway is provided in Supplemental
  Figure S6.'
