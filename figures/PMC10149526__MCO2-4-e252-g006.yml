caption: Analysis of melatonin level and its correlation with multiple‐omics molecules
  after sleep deprivation. (A) The melatonin level of plasma after sleep deprivation
  detected by ELISA kit. Pearson correlation analysis to identify multiomics molecules
  correlated with melatonin levels, (B) GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of correlated
  differentially expressed genes, and (C) differential proteins. (D) Pathway analysis
  of corrected differential metabolites. (E) The interactions analysis of multiomics
  molecules and disease connected with melatonin. Data are presented as mean ± SEM.
  *p < 0.05, n = 25 individuals per group.

  profiling changes caused by one night of sleep deprivation.
