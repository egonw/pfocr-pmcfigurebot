caption: 'GAS activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway to ameliorate hypoxic injury in
  HT22 cells (A), HT22 cells were incubated in a normal incubator (5% CO2, 37 °C)
  with GAS for 1 h and then placed in a hypoxia incubator (5% O2, 5% CO2, 90% N2,
  37 °C) for 36 h, and then the protein levels of GPx4 and COX2 were detected by Western
  blot (B), Immunofluorescence microscopy images of Nrf2 in HT22 after hypoxia treatment
  in the presence, or absence, of GAS for 36 h, and cell nuclei were stained with
  4,6-diamino-2-phenyl indole (DAPI, blue fluorescence). Mean fluorescence intensity
  values were calculated by Image J software (n = 3). Magnification, ×400; scale bars,
  25 µm. Results are presented as mean ± SD. ** p < 0.01, control versus hypoxia;
  #p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, hypoxia versus hypoxia plus GAS.'
