caption: Unbinding pathway of MDMB-FUBINACA (A) and HU-210 (C) obtained from the well-tempered
  metadynamics. Ligand along the pathway is shown with different color in stick representation.
  The superposition of representative frames of simulation replicas from the unbinding
  ensembles are shown, where the MDMB-FUBINACA (B) and HU-210 (D) are dissociating
  from the receptor. Both transmembrane (left panel) and extracellular (right panel)
  views are displayed here. Proteins and ligands are represented as cartoon and sticks,
  respectively.
