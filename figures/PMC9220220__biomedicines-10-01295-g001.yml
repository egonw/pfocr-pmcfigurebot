caption: In vitro studies on Rapa-ADMSCs. (A) ADMSCs at passage 3 (400Ã—), (B) flowcytometric
  analyses for the markers of ADMSCs (negative for CD34 and CD45 and positive for
  CD105 and CD44), (C) the effect of Rapa treatment on the viability of ADMSCs for
  2 h in culture and (D) the expression rate of autophages, migration and pro-inflammatory
  genes for Rapa treated and untreated cells. $ Significant vs. ADMSC group (p < 0.05).
