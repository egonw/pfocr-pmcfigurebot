caption: 'TMAO increased ROS levels in BMMs during osteoclast differentiation. (A)
  Representative confocal images of intracellular ROS generation. Scale bar = 100
  µm. (B) BMMs were stimulated with or without RANKL for 3 days and then probed with
  10 μM DCFH-DA for 30 min after being treated with different concentrations of TMAO.
  TMAO treatment led to increased fluorescence intensity of ROS in BMMs in a dose-dependent
  manner, and NAC treatment decreased TMAO-induced ROS generation (n = 3 per group).
  #p < 0.01.'
