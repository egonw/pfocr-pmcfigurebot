caption: 'Artemisinin improved the recovery of motor function and decreased neuronal
  injury induced by ischemia/reperfusion. (A) Evaluation of the effect of different
  doses of artemisinin (2, 6, 18 mg/kg) in the MCAO mice neurological deficits using
  Zea-Longa Scale neurological score. (B) Behavioral evaluation of the grasping strength
  of the forelimb with 6 mg/kg artemisinin. (C) Behavioral evaluation of the pole-jump
  test with 6 mg/kg artemisinin. * p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 were considered
  significantly different. (D) Representative images of Nissl staining, TUNEL staining
  and immunofluorescence of NeuN from the different groups. Scale bar: 100 μm and
  200 μm. (E) Quantitative analysis of Nissl staining. (F) Quantitative analysis of
  TUNEL staining. (G) Quantitative analysis of immunofluorescence of NeuN. **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001, versus ctrl group; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001 versus model
  group. The assay was repeated at least 3 times.'
