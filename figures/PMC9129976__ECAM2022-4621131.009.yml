caption: 'The effects of two FMP dosages on VEGFA, VEGFR2, Src, PI3k, Akt, and eNOS
  in colon tissue in AA-induced UC rats. Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM (n = 3).
  ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.001 compared with the control group, and #p < 0.05 compared with
  the model group. The thresholds of detection were as follows: VEGFA, 25 kDa; VEGFR2,
  200 kDa; Src, 55 kDa; PI3K, 80 kDa; Akt, 60 kDa; eNOS, 130 kDa; GAPDH, 37 kDa; a-tubulin,
  55 kDa; and ß-actin, 42 kDa.'

  Cytokines and the VEGF-PI3K/Akt-eNOS Signaling Pathway.
