caption: 'Pathogenesis of endotheliopathy based on “two-activation theory of the endothelium”.
  Endothelial molecular pathogenesis is initiated by the activated complement system
  following exposure to pathogen, toxin, drug, poison, venom, vaccine, polytrauma,
  hyperglycemia, severe hypertension, and others. Endotheliopathy releases inflammatory
  cytokines and hemostatic factors, and activates two clinically distinctive molecular
  pathways: inflammatory and microthrombotic. Both arterial endotheliolpathy and venous
  endotheliopathy provoke inflammation via inflammatory pathway leading to the inflammatory
  syndrome called MOIS due to cytokines, but arterial endotheliopathy promotes microthrombosis
  via microthrombotic pathway and produces aEA-VMTD due to activation of ULVWF path
  of hemostasis (shown in ). Arterial endotheliopathy is characterized by the triad
  of consumptive thrombocytopenia, MAHA, and MODS, which is called “TTP-like syndrome”,
  but venous endotheliopathy is characterized by ITP/“ITP-like syndrome” due to silent
  microthrombi with consumptive thrombocytopenia as explained in the text. The distinguishing
  features are caused by different anatomy, physiological function and hemodynamic
  characteristics between arterial system and venous system. These are very important
  pathological features in the understanding of the complexity of variable thrombotic
  phenotypes occurring endotheliopathic syndromes. Abbreviations: EA-VMTD, endotheliopathy-associated
  vascular microthrombotic disease; ITP, immune thrombocytopenic purpura; MAC, membrane
  attack complex; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; MAHA, microangiopathic hemolytic
  anemia; MODS, multiorgan dysfunction syndrome; MOIS, multiorgan inflammatory syndrome;
  TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TTP, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; aEA-VMTD,
  arterial EA-VMTD; vEA-VMTD, venous EA-VMTD; ULVWF, ultra large von Willebrand factor.'
