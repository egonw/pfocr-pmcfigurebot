caption: Analysis of reaction conditions for TRAD with monitoring of a pH, b salt
  concentration, c reaction temperature and d addition of DMSO. a, b pH and salt optima
  were analyzed photometrically with LDH and NADH coupling using 12-oxo-9(Z)-dodecenoic
  acid as substrate. The highest relative activities were set to 100% (for pH 7.5
  1.7 U ml−1 and for 50 mM NaCl 1.8 U ml−1). c, d Temperature and DMSO optima were
  analyzed in biocatalytic reactions with LC-ELSD quantification
