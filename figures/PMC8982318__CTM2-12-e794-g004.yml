caption: 'CD155/SRC complex formation inhibits the p38 MAPK signalling pathway in
  hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). (A) The interaction between CD155 and SRC was detected
  by co‐IP assay in MHCC97H cells. (B) Diagram of SRC WT, SRC del‐SH2, CD155 WT and
  CD155 del‐cyt. (C) The binding domains of CD155 and SRC were identified by co‐IP
  assay in HEK293T cells. (D) Expressions of SRC, p38 and their phosphorylated forms
  in CD155 knockdown and overexpression HCC cells were detected by Western blot (WB)
  assay. (E) Representative immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining images of p‐SRC (Tyr
  416), p‐SRC (Tyr 527) and p‐p38 in tumour tissues from orthotropic xenograft mice
  model; t‐tests and Mann–Whitney U tests were used. Scale bar: 20 μm. (F and G) Expressions
  of SRC, p38 and their phosphorylated forms in high CD155 expression HCC cells treated
  with PP2 (20 μM for 24 h) or transfected with shSRC were detected by WB assay. (H)
  A schematic diagram showing underlying molecular mechanism of CD155 in HCC. Error
  bars represent the SEM from at least three independent experiments. *p < .05; **p < .01;
  ***p < .001'
