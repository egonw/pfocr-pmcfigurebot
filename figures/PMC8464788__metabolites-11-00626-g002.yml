caption: 'Analysis of TGF-β-induced metabolic changes in NMuMG cells after 24 h treatment.
  (A) Heatmap of standardized concentrations (z-scores) of significantly different
  (p < 0.05, n = 3) intracellular metabolites after addition of TGF-β (5 ng/mL) compared
  to vehicle solvent control. (B) Schematic representation of metabolic changes induced
  by TGF-β (5 ng/mL) in NMuMG cells, including glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
  cycle, and aspartate production. Results are shown as mean ± s.d; * p < 0.05; **
  p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001; ns: non-significant. (C) Changes in metabolic
  pathways after TGF-β (5 ng/mL) or vehicle control treatment of NMuMG cells. Pathway
  scores were calculated based on the number of NMuMG cell-derived metabolites present
  in a pathway and the sign of change after TGF-β addition. PS of 1, as shown here
  for the pathway of choline metabolism in cancer, indicates that all detected metabolites
  in the pathway exhibited the same change after TGF-β addition. The thickness of
  each point represents the number of detected metabolites in each pathway. IP: inositol
  phosphate; PI: phosphatidylinositol; GST: glycine, serine, and threonine; RP: arginine
  and proline; Tau/HyTau: taurine and hypotaurine; ADE: alanine, aspartate, and glutamate;
  GPL: glycerophospholipid.'
