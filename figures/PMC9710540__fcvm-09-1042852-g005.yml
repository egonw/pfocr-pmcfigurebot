caption: P8 attenuates inflammatory response in hESC-derived cardiomyocytes subjected
  to hypoxia/reoxygenation injury. (A) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of differentially
  expressed genes between in the P8-treated group vs. the Ctrl group of hESC-derived
  cardiomyocytes subjected to hypoxia in a hypoxic cell incubator for 2 h followed
  by 1 h of reoxygenation (n = 3 per group). (B) Heatmap shows the selected differentially
  expressed transcripts (normalization with Z-score, adjusted p-value < 0.05) of TNF
  signaling pathway. (C) Heatmap shows the differentially expressed transcripts (normalization
  with Z-score, adjusted p-value < 0.05) of NF-κB signaling pathway. (D,E) Real-time
  PCR analysis of the expressions of (D) inflammation-related genes (CXCL-1, ICAM1)
  and (E) proinflammatory molecules (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, EMR-1 and CCR1) in hESC-derived
  cardiomyocytes after hypoxia-reoxygenation treatment (n = 3) cultures. *p < 0.05;
  **p < 0.01.
