caption: 'Effect of PAS-Na on cognitive ability in juvenile developmental Pb-exposed
  rats. a-e Rats were treated with 10 mg/kg PbAc for 4 weeks during the juvenile period,
  followed by 80, 160 or 240 mg/kg PAS-Na treatment for 2 weeks. Spatial learning
  and memory performance was evaluated in the Morris water maze. a Escape latency.
  b Swimming distance. c Number of times the rats crossed over the platform in the
  probe trial (Probe times) (n = 8 per group). Next, a Y-maze test was carried out
  to measure the rats spatial memory performance. Percentages of visit numbers (d)
  and duration (e) into the novel arm during the 5 min of the retrieval trial (n =
  8 per group). * P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01, compared to the control group. #p < 0.01
  and ##P < 0.01, compared to the Pb-treated group.'
