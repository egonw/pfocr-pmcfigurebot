caption: 'The PCAF inhibitor garcinol significantly attenuates the AngII-induced vascular
  aging phenotype in mice. (A) H&E staining to observe the vascular structure—the
  scale bar is 100 μm, 100× (n = 3); immunofluorescence staining to detect the expression
  of PCAF (green) and p53 (red)—the scale bar is 100 μm, 200× (n = 3). (B) Detection
  of p16 (red) and p21 (green) expression in mice thoracic aorta by double immunofluorescence
  staining; the scale bar is 100 μm, 400× (n = 3). (C,D) Western blot detects the
  expression of PCAF, aging-related proteins (p53, p21, p16, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1) and
  Nrf2 signaling pathway proteins in mice thoracic aorta (n = 6). ** p < 0.01 vs.
  the Sham group; # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01 vs. AngII group.'
