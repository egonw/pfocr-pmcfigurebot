caption: 'A hypothetical working model for StEXA1 and StnCBP as susceptibility factors
  associated with PVY infection in potato. StEXA1 and StnCBP interact and participate
  in the assembly of SGs as potential SGs components. PVYO may manipulate the StEXA1/StnCBP
  complex to help the viral RNA (vRNA) penetrate the SGs to facilitate virus accumulation
  through the interactions between HC-ProO and StnCBP. Conversely, HC-ProN of PVYN
  and PVYNTN itself can induce the formation of SGs through an unknown mechanism.
  However, it may also be involved in the same pathway depending on StEXA1 and StnCBP
  through a weaker interaction between HC-ProN and StnCBP. This model explains that
  the phenotypes knockdown of StEXA1 or StnCBP compromises PVYO accumulation but not
  PVYN:O and PVYNTN. SGs: stress granules; VRC: virus replication complex; vRNA: viral
  RNA.'
