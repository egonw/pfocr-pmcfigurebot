caption: 'General cell type clustering shows heterogeneity across granulomas. (A)
  UMAP visualization of 42,277 high-quality single cells colored by the 13 major cell
  types identified. Each point represents a single cell. (B) Marker genes for each
  cell type, with circle size representing the fraction of cells in the cell type
  (row) expressing the gene (column). Color represents the mean expression of that
  gene across cells from the cell type standardized across genes between 0 and 1 (by
  column). (C) Density of cells in UMAP space within each depletion condition, normalized
  within the condition. (D) Proportion of each cell type in each granuloma grouped
  by condition. Each point represents a single granuloma’s proportion of one cell
  type. Brackets indicate significant pairwise differential abundance (* P values
  <0.05 by GLM; Materials and methods; ). (E) UMAP visualization of further subclustering
  of macrophage/monocytes cell cluster colored by four subclusters. (F) Proportion
  of each macrophage/monocyte subcluster in E relative to total cells in each macrophage/monocyte
  subcluster. Brackets indicate significant pairwise differential abundance (P values
  <0.05 by GLM). (G and H) Marker genes for macrophage/monocytes subclusters as in
  B and H IL15 expression in each subcluster split by treatment condition. Legend
  shared with B. (I) Gene module scores, column standardized, for select GO biological
  programs found to be differential between CD8α-depleted macrophage/monocytes and
  IgG macrophage/monocytes. Each score is significantly higher between a-CD8a granulomas
  and IgG granulomas within each cell subset (Materials and methods). (J) UMAP visualization
  of further subclustering of cDC cell cluster colored by two subclusters. (K) Proportion
  of each cDC subcluster relative to total cDC cells in each granuloma as in F. (L)
  UMAP from J colored by depletion condition. (M) UMAP from J split by depletion condition
  (left to right: a-CD8α, a-CD8β, IgG) colored by normalized gene expression of CD8A
  and select cDC subset marker genes CLEC9A and CD1C in cells from that condition.
  (N) Select GO programs differential between cDCs from CD8α-depleted granulomas compared
  to IgG, as in I. Abbreviations: Sec Epi, secretory epithelial; T1P, type 1 pneumocyte;
  Mac/Mono, macrophages/monocytes; Fibro, fibroblasts; Neut., neutrophils; endo.,
  endothelial cells; Inflam., inflammatory; Alv., alveolar; reg., regulation; prod.,
  production; pos, positive; resp., response; sig., signaling; path., pathway.'
