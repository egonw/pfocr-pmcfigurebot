caption: Results of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis
  of differentially phosphorylated proteins in the (A) H/C and (B) E/H groups. The
  horizontal axis of the graph presents the ratio (%) of differentially phosphorylated
  sites corresponding to the expressed proteins annotated to each level of the metabolic
  pathway to the total number of differentially phosphorylated sites corresponding
  to the expressed proteins of all differentially phosphorylated sites annotated to
  the KEGG pathway. The vertical axis represents the name of the level pathway; the
  number on the right of the column represents the number of differentially phosphorylated
  sites corresponding to the proteins annotated to that Level pathway, and the columns
  in different colors represent different levels information.
