caption: GPX4 and TfR1 expression levels in papillary thyroid carcinoma. (A) TIMER2.0
  data analysis from TCGA database of Papillary Thyroid Carcinomas (N = 501) showing
  estimated GPX4 mRNA expression levels in thyroid cancer (black box) compared to
  the normal thyroid tissue (N = 59) (log2 fold change 9.7 vs 8.2, p < 0.001). (B).
  GPX4 overexpression is associated with worse 5-year OS (73% vs 97%; HR 2.95; 95%
  CI 2.1–7.9; p = 0.03). (C) Viability assay of thyroid cancer cell lines K1, MDA-T32,
  MDA-T68, TPC-1 and HThF control cells after treatment with RSL3 for 48 h. (D) RT-qPCR for
  GPX4 and transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) mRNA levels, normalized to β-actin, in K1,
  MDA-T32, MDA-T68, and TPC-1 cancer cell lines, as well as human thyroid fibroblasts
  (HThF) (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001, ns—p > 0.05). E Protein
  levels for GPX4 and TfR1 measured by Western blot analysis.
