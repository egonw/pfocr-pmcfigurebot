caption: Effect of SLs on the viability of RAW264.7 cells. Pretreatment with or without
  LPS (1 µg/mL) on cells for 1 h; then, cells were treated with different concentrations
  of SLs for 24 h. (A) Cytotoxicity effect of SLs and LPS on RAW 264.7 cells. (B)
  Cytotoxicity effect of SLs on LPS-induced cell viability in RAW 264.7 cells. The
  results are presented as the mean ± standard error of three independent tests in
  triplicate.
