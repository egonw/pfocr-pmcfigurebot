caption: Analysis of CD11b+, CD15+, and CD14+ expression. To confirm the differentiation
  and determination of lineage of differentiated cells, expression analysis of surface
  expression markers was performed using flow cytometry in the HL-60 cells treated
  with Mc2-Ac-hex and P3 (20 µg/ml each) at 96 h. Cells treated with 0.18% DMSO and
  1.2% DMSO were taken as VC and positive control, respectively. Three different sets
  were separately labelled with fluorescently tagged antibodies against CD11b (PE-cy5
  conjugated anti-CD11b), CD14 and CD15 (FITC-conjugated anti CD14 and FITC conjugated
  anti-CD15). Representative figure showing the overlay of the fluorescent HL-60 cells
  population in different treatment groups is shown in the left panel. The bar diagrams
  on the right show the quantitative analysis of HL-60 cells expressing CD11b+ (top
  right), CD15+ (middle), and CD14+ (bottom right). Data represent the mean ± SD of
  three independent experiments. Ordinary One-way ANOVA (Dunnett’s multiple comparisons)
  was performed to calculate the significant difference with respect to vehicle control.
