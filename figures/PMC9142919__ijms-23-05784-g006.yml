caption: Schematic presentation of the pathway of certain important metabolites whose
  accumulation is affected by HN or LN conditions in the leaves and roots of rapeseed.
  The red represents an increase, while the green represents a decrease. The colored
  dotted boxes represent important metabolic pathways. The solid black arrow represents
  a direct reaction, while the black dotted arrow represents an indirect reaction.
  The asterisk marks indicate that the relative levels of metabolites were significantly
  different (fold change > 2 or fold change < 5). VIP > 1.
