caption: Extracellular sugars and starch in WT and atg5 mutant Physcomitrella cells.
  (A) WT and atg5 cells were cultured on BCDATG agar medium for 7 d under light conditions.
  The cell wall components were fractionated into hot water extracted (HW), pectin,
  hemicellulose, and cellulose fractions, and the carbohydrate content of each fraction
  was measured. (B) Starch content was measured in 7-d-old WT and atg5 cells cultured
  on BCDATG or BCDAT agar medium. (A,B) Data are shown as means Â± SD (n = 3, *** p
  < 0.005, * p < 0.05).
