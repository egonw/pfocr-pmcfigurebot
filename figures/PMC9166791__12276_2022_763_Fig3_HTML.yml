figure_title: The expression of collagen is increased in RTN3-null mouse kidneys
caption: a Significantly differentially expressed genes between WT and RTN3-null mouse
  kidneys revealed by RNA-seq data. b KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of differentially
  expressed genes. The red square indicates the ECM−receptor interaction pathway.
  c mRNA levels of collagen-related genes in WT and RTN3-null mouse kidneys at 13
  months as assessed by real-time PCR. d, e Western blot analysis showing the expression
  of collagen type I/III, COL4A5, RTN3, and β-actin in WT and RTN3-null mouse kidneys
  at 13 months. f mRNA levels of collagen-related genes in HEK293 cells transfected
  with si-Control and si-RTN3. g, h TEM analysis showing the glomerular basement membranes
  of WT and RTN3-null mice at 13 months.
article_title: Loss of RTN3 phenocopies chronic kidney disease and results in activation
  of the IGF2-JAK2 pathway in proximal tubular epithelial cells.
