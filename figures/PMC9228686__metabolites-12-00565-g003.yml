caption: '(A). The topological analysis of the metabolic pathway involved in metabolomic
  difference of spleen between ITP and normal. X axis represent the impact of metabolic
  pathway, and Y axis represent the âˆ’log(p-value) of pathway. Each dot represents
  a pathway, and the color of dot represent p-value of pathway ranging from low (Red)
  to high (yellow). Labeled dots represent the statistically significant metabolic
  pathways based on p-value less than 0.001 and pathway impact higher than 0.05. The
  numbering of Pathways: 1. Taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, 2. Alanine, aspartate
  and glutamate metabolism. 3. Glycerophospholipid metabolism, 4. Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis,
  5. Pyruvate metabolism, 6. Inositol phosphate metabolism, 7. Pyrimidine metabolism,
  8. Glycerolipid metabolism, 9. Phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis,
  10. Phenylalanine metabolism, 11. Glutathione metabolism, 12. Glyoxylate and dicarboxylate
  metabolism, 13. Glycine, serine and threonine metabolism. (B). The metabolic enrichment
  analysis of discriminative metabolites. Y axis represents the identified metabolic
  pathways. (C). The disturbed metabolic network involved in spleen of ITP. The increased,
  decreased, and not significantly changed levels of the metabolites in ITP groups
  compared with the normal are presented by orange, blue, and grey boxes. The dashed
  boxes with different colors indicate the different biochemical pathways. GPC: glycerophosphocholine.'
