caption: Key gene selection for herpesvirus latency-mediated stroke occurrence. (A)
  Venn diagram of the intersection of the top 100 positively and negatively correlated
  genes with OTUD1 in the GSE22255 dataset and differentially expressed genes in stroke.
  (B) Co-expression heatmap of OTUD1 and 13 intersection genes. The Z-score transformation
  reduces the visualization effects of large differences in expression values between
  different variables and preserves differences in expression of individual variables
  between samples. (C) GO functional enrichment analysis of the 14 genes. (D) KEGG
  pathway enrichment analysis of the 14 genes.
