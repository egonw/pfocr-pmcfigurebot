caption: Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFUS) can increase the expression of orexin-A
  (OX-A) and orexin receptor 1 (OXR1) in traumatic brain injury (TBI) rat brain tissue.
  (A) OX-A and OXR1 represent western blot protein bands. (B, C) represents the gray
  values of the OX-A and OXR1 bands, respectively. (D) Representative immunohistochemical
  staining and relative protein expression of OX-A. (positive expression was brownish
  yellow. Scale=50 um). (E) OXR1 representative immunofluorescence staining. (OXR1
  staining is red, and all nuclear DAPI staining is blue. Scale=50 um). Results are
  expressed as mean±standard deviation (n=6, SD, *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001).
