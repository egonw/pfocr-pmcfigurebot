caption: A schematic model showing the role of Sam68 in intestinal inflammation. One
  possible mechanism involving Sam68 in intestinal inflammation is the activation
  of the canonical NF-кB pathway through the induction of RelA/p50 and c-Rel/p50 dimers.
  These canonical NF-кB dimers control the expression of several proinflammatory genes,
  including Tnf, Ccr2, Csf2, Il33, and Cxcl10. DSS treatment enhances the expression
  of these proinflammatory genes and the TNF produced further activates the inflammation
  in the presence of Sam68 (left). In the absence of Sam68, DSS-induced inflammation
  is greatly diminished, and TNF-induced NF-кB RelA/p50 and c-Rel/ p50 activation
  is compromised in colon cells. This decreased inflammatory signaling might play
  a role in protecting the Sam68 KO mice from experimental colitis (right), which
  may be translatable as an approach to treat the human disease through targeting
  Sam68
