caption: 'Expression of mRNAs for the signaling of CAF in endometrial NCAFs and TCAFs:
  Expression of signaling proteins of cell cycle pathway (CCND1, CCNE1 & BIRC5) (A),
  TGF pathway (TGFbeta1, TGFbeta2, TGFBR1 & TGFBR2) (B), FGF pathway, including FGF2
  (Ci), FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, & FGFR4 (Cii), Wnt-Beta-catenin pathway, including beta-catenin,
  CD44, c-MYC & DAPLE (Di), MMP1, MMP2, MMP7 & MMP9 (Dii), HER pathway including ERBB2,
  ERBB3 & NRG1 (E), ligands including EGF, HGF, & epiregulin (F), and steroid receptors,
  ESR1 and PGR (G) are presented. Green bars represented NCAF & Red bars represented
  TCAF. Cancer cell lines (represented in color bars) and human uterine fibroblasts
  (HUF, yellow bars) are used as controls. Inset shows the melting curves of the qRT-PCR
  reactions. Heatmap of mRNA expression is presented (H) patient-wise. Each column
  represents patients (Green for NCAF & Red for TCAF), and each row represents mRNA
  of the signaling proteins.'
