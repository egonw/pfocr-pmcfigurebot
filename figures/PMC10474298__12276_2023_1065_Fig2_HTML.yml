figure_title: VPA-exposed mice show upregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway
caption: a The overall design of the proteomic experiment. The dissected PFC tissues
  were homogenized and sonicated, and tryptic digestion was performed to break proteins
  down into peptides, which were further labeled with TMT isobaric labeling of 8 samples
  for 24 fractionations, followed by mass spectrometry quantitative analysis. b Volcano
  plot showing differentially expressed proteins between VPA-exposed mice and control
  mice (VPA-DEPs). The x-axis represents the log2 scale of the fold change in differential
  expression, while the y-axis represents the −log10 scale of the significance in
  changes. VPA-DEPs exhibiting expression changes with an absolute log2-fold change
  equal to or greater than 0.05 are labeled in the plot. c Enrichment analysis of
  VPA-DEPs with genes specific to five distinct cell types, as defined by single-cell
  RNA-seq data from the mouse nervous system. The log2(odds ratio) values that exceeded
  the range of −3 to 3 were adjusted to fit within this range. The blue and red colors
  represent the log2(odds ratio) values, and the size of the box corresponds to the
  significance in enrichment. d Enrichment analysis of VPA-DEPs with disorder risk
  genes. The log2(odds ratio) values that exceeded the range of −3 to 3 were adjusted
  to fit within this range. The blue and red colors represent the log2(odds ratio)
  values, and the size of the box corresponds to the significance in enrichment. Autism
  spectrum disorder (ASD), developmental disorder (DD), epilepsy (EP), and schizophrenia
  (SCZ). e Functional annotations for VPA-DEPs showing significantly enriched biological
  pathways (FDR ≤ 0.05). The x-axis represents the −log10 scale of significance in
  enrichment. The purple highlighted bars indicate the pathway associated with Wnt
  signaling enriched with all VPA-DEPs. The enriched pathways for upregulated and
  downregulated VPA-DEPs are highlighted in red and blue, respectively. f Protein–protein
  interaction (PPI) network of VPA-DEPs revealing proteins related to Wnt signaling
  and neuronal development.
