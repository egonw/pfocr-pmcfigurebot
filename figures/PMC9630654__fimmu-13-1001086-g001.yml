caption: 'Signaling pathways controlling actin dynamics downstream of the Rho family
  of small GTPases Black and red lines indicate stimulatory and inhibitory effects,
  respectively. Dashed black or red lines indicate that upon inhibition of a specific
  molecule, ceases the stimulatory or inhibitory effect exerted by this molecule on
  its direct downstream target. In the lower part of the figure is indicated the effect
  of the indicated pathway on F-actin. Abbreviations: Arp2/3, Actin Related Protein
  2/3 complex; CaM, Calmodulin; Cdc42, Cell Division Cycle 42; GAP, GTPase-activating
  proteins; GDP, Guanosine diphosphate; GEF, Guanine nucleotide exchange factors;
  GTP, Guanosine-5’-triphosphate; LIMK, LIM Motif-Containing Protein Kinase; mDia,
  mammalian Diaphanous-related formin; MLC, myosin light chain; MLCK, myosin light-chain
  kinase; MLCP, Myosin Light-Chain Phosphatase; PAK, p21-activated kinase; Rac, Ras-Related
  C3 Botulinum Toxin Substrate; RhoA, Ras homolog family member A; ROCK, Rho-associated
  protein kinase; SSH1, slingshot protein phosphatase 1; WASP, Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome
  protein; WAVE, WASP-family verprolin-homologous protein.'
article_title: A meta-analysis indicates that the regulation of cell motility is a
  non-intrinsic function of chemoattractant receptors that is governed independently
  of directional sensing.
