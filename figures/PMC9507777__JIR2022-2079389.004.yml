caption: Specific signaling events In the signal pathway network. (a)MHC-I signaling
  pathway network in HNSCC PBMC, TIL, and tonsil. (b) MHC-II signaling pathway network
  in HNSC PBMC, TIL, and tonsil. (c) MIF signaling pathway network in HNSC PBMC, TIL,
  and tonsil. (d) IL6 signaling pathway network in HNSCC PBMC, TIL, and tonsil. The
  edge color is consistent with the sender's source, and the edge weight is proportional
  to the interaction strength. A thicker edge line indicates a stronger signal. In
  the circle chart, the size of the circle is proportional to the number of cells
  in each cell group.
