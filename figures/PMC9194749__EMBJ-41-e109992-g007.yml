figure_title: Autophagy in unwounded epidermis
caption: 'A–EControl of epidermal autophagy by TOR signalling. (A) Epidermis of third
  instar larvae expressing the autophagosome marker GFP‐Atg8a together with constructs
  for up‐ or downregulating the autophagy pathway in the epidermis. Healthy epidermis
  contains few autophagosomes, but artificially activating autophagy through overexpression
  of Atg1 or blocking TOR signalling leads to accumulation of autophagosomes. (B)
  Higher magnification of the areas marked by magenta boxes in (A). (C) Quantification
  of Atg8a puncta in an area of 10,000 µm2, n = 6–8 larvae each genotype. We assumed
  unequal sample size and unequal variances and calculations were performed. Values
  are presented as box plots. Box plot elements are: centre line, median; box limits,
  upper and lower quartiles; whiskers, 1.5× interquartile range; points, outliers.
  For statistical hypothesis testing, independent and non‐parametric (Kruskal–Wallis)
  t‐tests were performed for the mean number of spots in control and experimental
  conditions. P‐values are indicated as follows: *P < 0.04; **P < 0.003; ***P < 0.0002
  and lack of an asterisk means non‐significant (P > 0.123). (D, E) Transmission electron
  micrographs of sections through the epidermis of larvae with elevated autophagy
  at two different magnifications. AP: autophagosome; Ax: cross‐section of an axon;
  BL: basal lamina; C: cuticle; HD: hemidesmosome; M: mitochondrion; N: nucleus.FDisruption
  of epidermal morphology after upregulation of autophagy. The membrane marker Src‐GFP
  is lost from large areas of the epidermis and nuclei have lost their regular spacing.

  after time‐controlled Atg16B expression. Src‐GFP containing material appears to
  be taken out of and eventually detached from lateral cell membranes (arrows). Over
  the period of observation, abnormal accumulation of GFP is seen in the nuclei (cyan
  asterisks). t = 0 is 6 h after A58‐Gal4 activation. Image from Movie . Data information:
  A, B, F, H, z‐projections; n = 20–50 larvae each genotype. Scale bars: A, F, H,
  20 μm, B, 10 μm, D, 1 μm and E, 500 nm. Source data are available online for this
