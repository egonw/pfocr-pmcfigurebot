figure_title: Depletion of ESCRT-I leads to nuclear accumulation of TFEB and TFE3
  in DLD-1 and HEK293 cells
caption: '(A, B) Western blots showing levels of TFEB and TFE3 proteins in whole-cell
  lysates (W) and nuclear fractions (N) of DLD-1 (in A) or HEK293 (in B) cells treated
  with control nontargeting siRNAs (siCtrl#1 or 2) or siRNA targeting ESCRT-I (siTsg101#1
  or #2, Vps28#1 or #2). To examine the fraction purity, the levels of vinculin (cytosolic
  marker) were probed. The lamin protein was used as a gel loading control for nuclear
  fractions.'

  via the Rag-mTORC1 pathway.
