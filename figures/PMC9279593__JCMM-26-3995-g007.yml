caption: 'Celecoxib represses insulin‐driven Akt/mTORC1 signaling and its downstream
  lipogenic pathway in vitro. (A) Immunoblotting analysis of Akt and mTOR phosphorylation
  in HepG2 cells upon incubation with insulin for 30 min in the presence (10–50 μM)
  and absence of celecoxib. (C) Immunoblotting analysis of the phosphorylation of
  Akt/mTOR and expression of key lipogenic proteins in HepG2 cells with chronic incubation
  (72 h) with insulin (100 nM), in the presence (10–50 μM) and absence of celecoxib.
  Histograms in (B) and (D) represent the expression of key components in the Akt/mTORC1‐dependent
  lipogenic cascade quantified using western blotting optical analysis shown in (A)
  and (C), respectively. Immunoreactive bands (including those with white backgrounds)
  were visualized in a gel documentation system (G: BOX Chemi XRQ, Syngene) without
  further modification. Quantified data are presented as mean ± SD, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001
  versus the MOCK group; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 versus the insulin‐incubated
  group. Abbreviations: CELE, celecoxib; t, total; p, phosphorylated'
