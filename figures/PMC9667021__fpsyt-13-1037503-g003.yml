caption: The expression of selected genes in the brain. Based on the Human Protein
  Atlas, FDX1, DLAT, LIAS, and ATP7B could all be detected in 12 brain regions. In
  the A-431 cell line, FDX1 protein and DLAT protein were located in mitochondria
  (A,B), and LIAS protein was located in mitochondria and the nucleoplasm (C). ATP7B
  protein was also expressed in the Golgi apparatus in the CACO-2 cell line (D). The
  schematic graph shows the main location of each protein in cells (E). The target
  proteins, nuclei and microtubules were stained green, blue, and red, respectively.
  nTPM, normalized transcript expression values.
