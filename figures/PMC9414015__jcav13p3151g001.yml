caption: Lycorine inhibited NF-κB activity. (A) Structure of lycorine. (B) Lycorine
  inhibited TNF-α induced NF-κB activity. The PC3-NF-κB-Luc were left untreated or
  exposed to TNF-α (20 ng/ml) for 12 h. Then, PC3-NF-κB-Luc cells were treated with
  Lycorine at final concentration as indicated. TPCA-1 (2 µM) is a specific inhibitor
  of NF-κB for positive control and DMSO as vehicle. Luciferase activity was measured
  using Steady-Glo® Luciferase Assay System (Promega). The values are mean±S.D. for
  three independent replicates. (C) Lycorine inhibited constitutive NF-κB-dependent
  luciferase activity. PC3-NF-κB-Luc cells were treated as describe above with lycorine
  in different concentration. (D) Lycorine inhibited NF-κB signaling activity via
  different treatments stimulating. Lycorine concentration is 1 µM. PC3 cells were
  treated with LPS (1 µg/ml), TNF-α (20 ng/ml), PMA (30 ng/ml) and IL-1β (20 ng/ml)
  for inducing NF-κB signaling pathway activity. *P<0.05, **P<0.001.
