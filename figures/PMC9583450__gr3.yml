caption: 'Experiment 4: RNA-sequencing of myonuclear RNA from plantaris muscle after
  72 h of mechanical overload.A, image showing myonuclear GFP labeling, DNA (DAPI),
  and dystrophin via histochemistry in a doxycycline-treated HSA-GFP mouse (see refs.
  () and ()); the scale bar represents 100 μm. B, pathway analysis of upregulated
  genes specifically in FANS-isolated myonuclei in OV versus sham. C, myonuclear Mmp9
  mRNA levels in sham and overload determined by RNA-seq. D, Myc mRNA levels in sham
  and overload determined by RNA-seq. E, Runx1 mRNA levels in sham and overload determined
  by RNA-seq. F, Ankrd1 (Marp1) mRNA levels in sham and overload determined by RNA-seq.
  G, pathway analysis of downregulated genes specifically in FANS-isolated myonuclei
  in OV versus sham. FANS, fluorescent activated nuclear-sorted; OV, overload.'
