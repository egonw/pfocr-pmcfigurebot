caption: Schematic illustration of neonatal anesthesia-induced oxidative stress in
  the brain. During the administration of neonatal anesthesia, there are three immediate
  pathways (blue) for how oxidative stress (red) can manifest. These immediate pathways
  have three distinct sources, altered signaling, administration of supplemental oxygen,
  and neuronal cell death; each of these can increase the concentration of ROS and
  induce oxidative stress. The short-term pathway (yellow) appears to be less impactful
  since it is short-lived; this is shown in the figure with a dashed arrow. The long-term
  pathway (green) shows the delayed effects of neonatal anesthesia and how the initial
  damage to neurons can negatively affect neurovascular interactions, leading to oxidative
  stress.
