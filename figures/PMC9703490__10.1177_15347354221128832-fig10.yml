caption: Expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, and NF-κB in protein level in A549 cells. (A
  and B) represent the western blot of MMP-2, MMP-9, and NF-κB from lysate after 24 hours
  of treatment of F6 (0-50 µg/ml) and F8 (0-50 µg/ml) in A549 cells respectively.
  The lower panel of each blot is the internal control β-actin. DMSO was used as the
  negative control. The % of MMPs expressions are presented graphically in (C and
  D) for F6 and F8 respectively by taking control as 100%. Each bar represents the
  mean with the standard deviation of expression of MMPs from 3 independent experiments.
  Here “*” defines 0.01 < P ≤ 0.05.
