caption: CCK8 was used to detect the cytotoxicity of Andro on RLE-6TN cells. Cells
  were treated with various concentrations of Andro ranging from 3.125 to 100 mg/l.
  Cell viability showed a gradual cell death when the drug dose exceeded 25 mg/l;
  therefore, the Andro concentration selected for this experiment was 6.25, 12.5,
  25 mg/l. Andro andrographolide
