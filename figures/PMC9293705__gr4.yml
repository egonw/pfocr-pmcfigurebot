caption: Increasing the production of ginsenosides F2 and 3β,20S-Di-O-Glc-DM in the
  engineered yeasts by multistep metabolic engineering strategies. The strains were
  cultivated in YPD medium in shake flasks for 3 days. The genes in blue boxes are
  involved in the upstream biosynthetic pathway. The genes in orange boxes are involved
  in the downstream biosynthetic pathway. The genes in green boxes are involved in
  the UDPG biosynthetic pathway. The genes in purple boxes are the transcriptional
  activator genes.
