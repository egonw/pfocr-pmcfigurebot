caption: DOT1L inhibition or silencing induces autophagy by activating the AMP-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. (A)
  Gene sets enriched 15 KEGG signaling pathways in phenotype DOT1l_high. (B) GSEA
  indicated that DOT1L expression was closely related to mTOR signaling in renal cancer
  samples (TCGA-KIRC). (C and D) Western blot analysis showing the total and phosphorylated
  levels of AMPK, mTOR in SGC0946 treated renal cancer cells. (E and F) Western blot
  analysis showing the total and phosphorylated levels of AMPK, mTOR in DOT1L knockdown
  renal cancer cells. *P < .05, **P < .01, and ***P < .001, compared with ctrl group.
