caption: 'Enrichment of DEGs for function. (A and B) Forecasts of DEG functions were
  achieved using GO analysis. The cytokine-mediated signaling pathway, specific granule,
  and immune receptor activity were functionally enriched in septic neonates; (C and
  D) KEGG pathway was evaluated regarding DEGs. The immune-related pathways were enriched
  in septic neonates. DEG: Differentially expressed gene; GO: Gene Ontology; KEGG:
  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; IL: Interleukin; TNF: Tumor necrosis factor.'
