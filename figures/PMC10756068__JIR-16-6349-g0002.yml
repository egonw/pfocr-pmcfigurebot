caption: 'This image depicts the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of I. obliquus
  on the kidney. Left: I. obliquus can reduce the concentration of proinflammatory
  cytokines such as PGE2, IL-1β, and TNF-α secreted by macrophages in kidney tissue,
  thus inhibiting the blood glucose-induced NF-κB activation and TGF-β release. Middle:
  I. obliquus treatment downregulates the TA-induced NF-Κb/TGF-β signaling pathway,
  and decreases the level of TG released by the pancreas, accompanied by decreased
  ACR and increased HDL/LDL. Hence, I. obliquus has a protective role in glomerular
  structure. Right: Oral administration of I. obliquus could increase the expression
  of GLUT4 and PI3K/Akt pathway in adipose tissue, as well as the AMPK/ACC pathway
  in diabetic mice.'
