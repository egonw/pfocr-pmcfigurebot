caption: 'Metabolism and function of amino acids in chondrocytes. Scheme showing the
  main cellular processes (in green boxes) supported by amino acids in chondrocytes.
  Dotted lines indicate a pathway consisting of several reactions. Key enzymes are
  in italic. Transcription factors that promote the expression of amino acid transporters
  or metabolic enzymes are depicted in red. Abbreviations: 1C: one-carbon metabolism,
  3PG: 3-phosphoglycerate, Acan: aggrecan, Ac-CoA: acetyl-CoA, αKG: α-ketoglutarate,
  Col2: type 2 collagen, (N)EAA: (non-)essential amino acid, ETC: electron transport
  chain, GLS: glutaminase, GSH: glutathione, HAT: histone acetyl transferase, PPP:
  pentose phosphate pathway, ROS: reactive oxygen species, TCA: tri-carboxylic acid
  cycle. Three-letter abbreviations are defined in .'
