caption: NUP85 knockdown attenuates liver injury in MCD-fed mice. A and C. The mRNA
  and protein expression levels of SREBP-1C, ACOX-1 and PPAR-α in mice liver tissues
  were detected by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. B and C. RT-qPCR and Western blotting
  were used to detect the expression levels of IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β in the liver
  tissues of mice. D. Analysis of small animals imaging. E-F. The mRNA and protein
  expression levels of NUP85. G. Serum ALT, AST and TG assay. H. HE staining of liver
  tissues. I. Oil Red O staining in liver tissues. J. Levels of serum IL-1β, IL-6
  and TNF-α. K. Western blotting results of the expression levels of CCR2. L-M. IHC
  analysis of NUP85 and CCR2. N-O. The mRNA and protein expression levels of IL-1β,
  IL-6, TNF-α, SREBP-1C, PPAR-α and ACOX-1. Measurement metrics are shown in the figure.
  All experimental results of this study were replicated at least three times. **p<0.01,
  ***p<0.001 compared with the control group.
