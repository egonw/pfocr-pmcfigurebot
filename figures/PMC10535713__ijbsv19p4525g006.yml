caption: 'PBX3/G6PD axis regulates the tumorigenic potential of CRC cells. A-C. Tumorigenic
  potentials of shCon+pcCon (shCon), shPBX3+pcCon (shPBX3), and shPBX3+pcG6PD (shPBX3+pcG6PD)
  stable cell lines were examined in vivo by subcutaneous injection of these cells
  into Balb/c-nu/nu mice (n = 6). Tumor volume at indicated time points (A), morphological
  images at 18 days after transplantation (B), and tumor weight at 18 days after transplantation
  (C) are shown. D-E. PBX3 and G6PD protein expression levels in the xenografted tumors,
  as examined using western blotting (D) and immunohistochemistry (E). F. PBX3 and
  G6PD mRNA expression levels in clinical human CRC and corresponding adjacent tissues,
  as analyzed using qRT-PCR (n = 20). G-H. PBX3 and G6PD protein expression levels
  in clinical human CRC (T) and corresponding normal adjacent tissues (N), as examined
  using western blotting (G) and immunohistochemistry staining (H). Cells transfected
  with shCon and pcCon were used as control. β-actin was used for qRT-PCR normalization
  and as the western blotting loading control. Scale bars: 20 μm Quantification data
  are shown as mean ± SD. pcEF9-Puro, **P < 0.01.'
