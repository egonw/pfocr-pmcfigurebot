figure_title: GPSM1 deficiency inhibits TLR4-induced NF-κB inflammatory signaling
  of macrophages
caption: a–f Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from GPSM1f/f; Lyz2-cre mice
  and GPSM1f/f littermates were treated with 200 ng/ml LPS or vehicle control for
  indicated times. a Immunoblot analysis of GPSM1 protein in cell lysates of LPS-treated
  BMDMs. b BMDMs were stimulated with LPS for 24 h and levels of F4/80 and CD11c were
  assessed using flow cytometry. c Immunoblot analysis of p-IKKα/β, IKKβ, p-IκBα,
  IκBα, p-P65, and P65 in BMDMs treated with LPS for indicated times. d Immunoblot
  analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts and analyzed for P65. e LPS-primed
  BMDMs were treated with ATP or Nigericin. Immunoblotting was used to detect IL-1β,
  p17, casp-1, and p20 in supernatants (Sup), and pro-IL-1β and pro-casp-1 in cell
  extracts (lysates). f TNF-α, IL-6, and CCL2 levels in culture media were determined
  using ELISA (n = 3 or 4 independent samples per group). g GPSM1f/f BMDMs were infected
  with Lv-shCON or Lv-shGPSM1 for 72 h and treated with LPS for additional indicated
  times. Immunoblot analysis of p-IKKα/β, IKKβ, p-IκBα, IκBα, p-P65, and P65 is shown.
  h Immunoblot analysis of GPSM1, p-IKKα/β, IKKβ, p-IκBα, IκBα, p-P65, and P65 in
  THP-1 cells treated with LPS (500 ng/ml) for indicated times. i Immunoblot analysis
  of GPSM1, p-IKKα/β, IKKβ, p-IκBα, IκBα, p-P65, and P65 in BMDMs transfected with
  Ad-CON or Ad-GPSM1 for 48 h and treated with LPS for indicated times. j Representative
  immunofluorescence images of macrophage p-P65 staining with antibodies against p-P65
  (red) and F4/80 (green) in eWAT. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Scale bars,
  100 μm. Throughout, all independent experiments were performed three times with
  similar results (a–e, g–j). Data are presented as means ± SEM. P values are determined
  by two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple-comparisons test (f).
