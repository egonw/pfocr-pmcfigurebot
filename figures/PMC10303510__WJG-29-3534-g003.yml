caption: 'Enrichment metabolic pathway and volcano map of metabolites. A: Enrichment
  metabolic pathway in plasma; B: Enrichment metabolic pathway in feces. Enrichment
  Ratio was computed by Hits/Expected, where hits = observed hits; expected = expected
  hits (details in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4); C: Volcano map of metabolites in
  plasma; D: Volcano map of metabolites in feces. All metabolites were screened by
  fold change (FC) > 2, P < 0.05 or FC < 0.5, P < 0.05. FC: The quantitative ratio
  of alcohol-related liver cirrhosis to healthy control group. HC: Healthy control
  group; ALC: Alcohol-related liver cirrhosis group.'
article_title: Difference and clinical value of metabolites in plasma and feces of
  patients with alcohol-related liver cirrhosis.
