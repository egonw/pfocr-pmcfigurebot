caption: Transcriptomic analysis of MALINC1-overexpressing cells. (a) Fold induction
  levels of MALINC1 expression in stably transduced MCF10A and DCIS.COM cell lines
  as determined by RNA-seq profiles (log2CPM) in pLOC-MALINC1 or pLOC-empty transfected
  cells (p = 0.035 and p = 0.005, respectively). (b) Hierarchical clustering of MCF10A
  and DCIS.COM stably transduced cells with either vector control (pLOC-empty) or
  lentivirus expressing MALINC1 (pLOC-MALINC1) based on RNA-seq profiles. (c) Heat
  map representation of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) obtained by RNA-seq
  analysis (FDR < 0.01; FC > 2). Red and green colors represent upregulated and downregulated
  genes, respectively. (d) Venn diagram of transcripts commonly modulated among MCF10
  and DCIS.COM stably transduced cells. (e) Functional enrichment analysis of the
  transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in the promoter region of the commonly
  modulated genes among normal and DCIS cells. Statistical significance was determined
  by the hypergeometric test. (f,g) Functional enrichment of bioprocesses identified
  as affected by the expression of MALINC1 in MCF10A and DCIS.COM cells. At the top,
  bioprocesses are enriched due MALINC1 overexpression in MCF10A cell lines. At the
  bottom, bioprocesses are enriched due MALINC1 overexpression in DCIS.COM cell lines.
  The red dotted line represents the basic significance level (p < 0.05). (h) Pathway
  commonly affected among MCF10A and DCIS.COM MALINC1 stably transduced cells (p <
  0.05).
