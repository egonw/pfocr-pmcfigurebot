caption: Gene expression of KRAS in ten PDAC cell lines and the control. The sensitivity
  to MK-2206 (a), Buparlisib (b), and the variants of KRAS are indicated for each
  cell line. Gene expressions are displayed as Log2 (TPM + 1). Compared with the control
  group, expression levels of KRAS were increased in all cell lines.
