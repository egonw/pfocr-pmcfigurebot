caption: GO function enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses of SDELs-related mRNAs in
  the hippocampus of 5×FAD mice. GO annotation of the top 10 BPs, CCs, and MFs related
  to upregulated (a–c) and downregulated (e–g) mRNAs. The bubble size represents the
  number of targets enriched in each entry, while the color represents the enrichment
  significance based on the corrected p-value. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of
  upregulated (d) and downregulated (h) mRNAs. Each line represents one gene, and
  a line connecting two pathways indicates that this gene is enriched in both pathways.
  The wider the connecting line, the greater the number of shared genes. Different
  pathways are presented in different colors.
