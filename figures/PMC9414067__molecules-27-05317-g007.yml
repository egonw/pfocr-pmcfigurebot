caption: 'Transcriptional activation of the amino acid response pathway in NRK-52E
  cells treated with 4 mM β-CEC or CMC and co-treated with no or 4 mM amino acids
  for 18 h. The abbreviations are conventional one-letter abbreviations for amino
  acids, except for C standing for N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Responses significantly different
  from “not co-treated” in each group (n = 3, p < 0.05) are marked with # (more than
  “not co-treated”) and * (less than “not co-treated”). See  for viabilities and extended
  data.'
