caption: 'Identification of two cuproptosis-related molecular phenotypes by unsupervised
  learning in CRC. A. The consensus matrix thermogram defines two cuproptosis phenotypes
  (k = 2) and shows their correlation area by unsupervised learning. B. The principal
  component analysis of CPRMs shows a remarkable difference in transcriptomes between
  the two subtypes. C. The Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival of two consensus
  phenotypes in TCGA using the log-rank test. D. The thermogram shows the differences
  in clinicopathologic features and mRNA expression levels of CPRMs between the two
  cuproptosis phenotypes. T-test: * P < 0.05, * * P < 0.01, * ** P < 0.001. E. The
  bar chart shows the results of GSVA analysis of the differentially expressed genes
  between the two consensus phenotypes. F. The boxplot shows the differences in pathway
  ssGSEA scores between the two cuproptosis phenotypes. T-test: nsP > 0.05, * P < 0.05,
  * * P < 0.01, * ** P < 0.001.'
