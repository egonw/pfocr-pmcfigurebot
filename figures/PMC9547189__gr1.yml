caption: 'PE-complicated trophoblasts are associated with upregulated expression of
  miR21, which impairs invasion and migration(A) Heatmap of gene expression from a
  microarray of normal and preeclamptic term placentae; n = 5, two-tailed t test,
  ∗p < 0.05. (B) ddPCR analysis of miR21 expression in human term placentae from normal
  and PE-complicated pregnancies; n = 19 in the control and n = 20 in the PE group,
  two-tailed t test, ∗p < 0.05. (C) RT-qPCR analysis of miR21 expression in primary
  human trophoblasts (PHTs) isolated from normal and preeclamptic term placentae;
  n = 3, two-tailed t test, ∗p < 0.05. FISH of miR21 and IF staining of CK7 and HLA-G
  in term normal and PE-complicated placentae (D) and decidua (E); scale bar, 100 μm.
  HTR8/SVneo cells transfected with mimic NC (NC), inhibitor NC (in NC), miR21 mimic
  (mimic), or miR21 inhibitor (inhibitor) for 6 h and then cultured in fresh medium
  for 48 h and blank control cells were subjected to (F) Matrigel Transwell assays
  (scale bar, 400 μm), (G) wound-healing assays (scale bar, 100 μm), (H) CCK-8 staining
  assays, (I) EdU assay, and (J) flow cytometry assay for measuring apoptosis by staining
  with Annexin V-FITC and PI (n = 3 in each group, one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple
  comparison test; ns, nonsignificant; ∗p < 0.05 versus mimic NC; #p < 0.05 versus
  inhibitor NC). The data are presented as the means ± SEMs.'
