caption: 'Network diagram of the correlation between DTFs, DEGs, and DAMs in the flavonoid
  biosynthetic pathway of L. polystachyus. (a) Correlation network diagram between
  DTFs and DEGs in different organ comparison groups. (b) Correlation network diagram
  between DTFs and DEGs at different growth and development stage comparison groups.
  (c) Correlation network diagram between DTFs and DAMs in different organ comparison
  groups. (d) Correlation network diagram between DTFs and DAMs in the comparison
  groups at different growth and development stages. Pink octagons: DAFs, blue rounds:
  DEGs, purple hexagons: DTFs; orange lines: positive correlations, green lines: negative
  correlations.'
