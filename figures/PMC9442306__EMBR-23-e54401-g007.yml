figure_title: RT‐qPCR analysis of EPO and MYC
caption: HEK293T cells transfected with optoYAP were analysed for expression levels
  of EPO and MYC after 48 h of activation protocol. Erythropoietin (EPO) is a growth
  factor that is not induced by the Hippo‐YAP pathway and does not have an increase
  in transcript levels with activation of optoYAP. MYC is a target gene of YAP‐TEAD
  signalling and is increased in the presence of activated optoYAP. Gene expression
  was normalised to EIF1B housekeeping gene. Horizontal bars represent mean and 95%
  confidence interval from six biological replicates across three independent experiments
  for each condition.
