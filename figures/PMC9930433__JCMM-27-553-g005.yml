caption: Treg differentiation in VAT was assessed using CD4+, CD25+ and FOXP3+ antibodies.
  (A) CD4+, CD25+ and FOXP3+ in wild‐type general feeding, wild‐type high‐fat, JAZF‐1
  transgenic general feeding, and JAZF‐1 transgenic high‐fat groups; (B) CD4+, CD25+
  and FOXP3+ in control (JAZF‐1 transgenic), PPAR‐γ agonist, and PPAR‐γ inhibitor
  groups for AAV‐Jazf1 mice; (C) CD4+, CD25+ and FOXP3+ in general feeding plus normal
  saline, high‐fat plus normal saline, general feeding plus PPAR‐γ inhibitor and high‐fat
  plus PPAR‐γ inhibitor groups for AAV‐Jazf1 mice.
article_title: Regulatory T cells differentiation in visceral adipose tissues contributes
  to insulin resistance by regulating JAZF‐1/PPAR‐γ pathway.
