caption: The expression levels of ZNF224 increase during CLL progression. (A) Evaluation
  of ZNF224 RNA expression in CLL patients stratified according to the risk of disease
  progression. (B) ROC curve showing accuracy of ZNF224 expression in differentiating
  medium and high-risk patients from low-risk patients. (C) Evaluation of ZNF224 RNA
  expression in CLL patients divided according to the presence of lymphadenopathy
  and/or splenomegaly.
