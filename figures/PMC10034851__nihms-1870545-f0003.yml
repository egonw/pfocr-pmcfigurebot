  cells after DAC treatment
caption: (A and B) Heatmap representing Z-scores of IFN-Î³ response (A) and inflammatory
  response genes (B) in various kidney cancer cell lines across 300-nM DAC treatment
  timepoints.(C) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) hallmark pathway enrichment (normalized
  enrichment score, adjusted p value <0.05) of differentially expressed genes between
  SETD2-EV (control) and SETD2-KO 786-O cell lines across DAC treatment timepoints.(D)
  Number of TE that were up-regulated by more than 2-fold change after DAC treatment.(E)
  Expression profile of induced TEs (>2-fold change) in 786-O EV and KO cells.
