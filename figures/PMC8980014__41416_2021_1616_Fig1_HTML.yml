figure_title: CSNK2 phosphotargets, associated pathways, and CSNK2-regulated phenotypes
  identified in this review
caption: 'a Graphical summary of the pathways from which the five most commonly cited
  CSNK2 targets across all cancers were identified in this review: AKT, PTEN, RELA
  (NFkB), TP53 and STAT3. Red dotted arrows indicate negative regulation. Blue arrows
  indicate all other interactions. b The four most common biological phenotypes associated
  with CSNK2 in cancer, categorised by cancer hallmark [] were: apoptosis (A), proliferation
  (P), cell cycle control (C) and invasion/metastasis (I). These four phenotypes were
  paired to the pathways from a if the pathway was an established regulator of this
  biological behaviour.'
