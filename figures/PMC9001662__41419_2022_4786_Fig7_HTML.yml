figure_title: Inhibition of P2X7 alleviated LPS-induced apoptosis and pyroptosis in
  mRECs by attenuating the activation of P2X7 and NLRP3 inflammasome
caption: 'a P2X7 and NLRP3 inflammasome protein levels. b, d Cell apoptosis was measured
  using flow cytometry. c Immunofluorescence co-staining on cells co-stimulated with
  high glucose and LPS for 7 days, P2X7(red fluorescence), NLRP3(green fluorescence),
  DAPI(blue fluorescence) e Secretion of IL-6, ICAM-1, TNF-α, and IL-1β was evaluated
  in cell culture medium under different conditions for 48 h using customized ELISA
  kits. Results are expressed as mean ± SD; Statistical analyses were performed using
  one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison’s test; n = 6; t = 48 h. Data are
  expressed as the means ± SD (n = 3). *P < 0.05, *P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 vs. the
  control group. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, vs. the HG + LPS group.'
