caption: 'Blocking the mTOR pathway can alleviate the adverse effects of PPARγ inhibition:
  (A) Protein levels of p70S6K, p-p70S6k, LC3B-I, LC3B-II and BAX were determined
  by Western blotting (). ImageJ grayscale intensity measurements were performed on
  protein bands, and the ratios of (B) p-p70S6K/p70S6K, (C) LC3B-II/LC3B-I, and (D)
  BAX/β-actin were calculated. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD of three independent
  trials. Different letters above the bars indicate significant differences (p < 0.05).'
