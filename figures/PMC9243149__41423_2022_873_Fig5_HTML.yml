caption: p38α regulates IL-12 expression by modulating the MK2−c-FOS signaling pathway
  axis in DCs. a The abundances of p-MK2, p-c-FOS and p38 in Flt3L-DCs stimulated
  with HDM in the presence of vehicle or an MK2 inhibitor were analyzed by Western
  blot analysis. b Percentages of IL-12p40+ cells in HDM-stimulated WT and p38α-deficient
  lung cDC1s pretreated with vehicle, an AP1 inhibitor or an MK2 inhibitor (n = 3).
  c Expression of Il4 and Il13 in OT-II CD4+ T cells activated with HDM-pretreated
  Flt3L-cDC1s stimulated with vehicle or an AP1 inhibitor and washed (n ≥ 3). *P < 0.05;
  **P < 0.01; ns, not significant. Data are representative of three (a, b) independent
  experiments with consistent results or pooled from two (c) independent experiments
  with consistent results. Two-way ANOVA (b, c) was performed, and the data are presented
  as the mean ± SEM
