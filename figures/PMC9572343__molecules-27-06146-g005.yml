caption: MKP-2 Silencing Promotes Cell Apoptosis in Breast Cancer Cells. MKP-2 was
  silenced from MDA-MB-231 cells or infected with Adv. MKP-2 (500 pfu/cell) for 24
  h, then treated with indicated concentrations of Dox for 24 h, then (A,C) Apoptosis
  was detected by labelling cells with Annexin V-tagged FITC/7AAD and analyzing them
  by flowcytometry. (B,D) Cell lysates were prepared, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then
  assessed for Bcl-xl, Bax, Caspase-9, Caspase-3 c-Caspase-3, c-PARP, p-γ-H2AX, and
  β-Actin. Each value represents the mean ± S.E.M of three independent experiments.
  * p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤ 0.001, compared with the correspondent control.
