figure_title: Genetic activation of MAPK cascade suppressed the Rheb-dependent inhibition
  of the pheromone response
caption: '(A) Cell images from cultures of strains carrying the prf1con allele and
  the indicated mutations, showing the absence or presence of conjugation tubes upon
  incubation for 6 hours in minimal ammonium media in the presence of synthetic a2
  pheromone (2.5 μg/ml). Bar: 15 μm. The numbers indicated the percentage of cells
  showing conjugation tubes (mean ±SD from 3 independent experiments counting 100
  cells each). (B) qRT-PCR for the indicated genes from control (FB1 prf1con) and
  mutant cells incubated for 6 hours in minimal ammonium media in the presence of
  synthetic a2 pheromone (2.5 μg/ml). Values are referred to the expression of each
  gene in the control strain. Each column represents the mean value of three independent
  biological replicates. Error bars represent the SD. (C) Cell images from cultures
  of strains carrying the ectopic Pcrg1:fuz7DD allele and the indicated mutations
  (control: FB1 Pcrg1:fuz7DD), showing the presence of conjugation tubes upon incubation
  during 6 hours in minimal ammonium medium amended with arabinose. Bar: 15 μm. The
  numbers indicated the percentage of cells showing conjugation tubes (mean ±SD from
  3 independent experiments counting 100 cells each). (D) qRT-PCR of cultures from
  A. Values are referred to the expression of each gene in the control strain (FB1
  Pcrg1:fuz7DD). Each column represents the mean value of three independent biological
  replicates. Error bars represent the SD.'
