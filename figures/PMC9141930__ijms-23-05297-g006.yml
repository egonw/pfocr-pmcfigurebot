caption: 'Pathway enrichment analysis of the DEmiRNAs and DEmRNA interactions from
  EAT and SAT: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to perform pathway enrichment
  analysis on the mRNA (RNA-seq) and miRNA (microRNA microarray) that were differentially
  expressed in EAT compared to SAT. Targets of miRNAs relevant to cardiovascular diseases
  were identified after a stringent filtering process (A). mRNA targets of DEmiRNAs
  are shown with IPA annotations for selected cardiovascular disorders (B). Six miRNAâ€“mRNA
  pairs that played a role in cardiovascular disease were identified.'
