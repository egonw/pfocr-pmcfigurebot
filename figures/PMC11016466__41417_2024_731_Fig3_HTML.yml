figure_title: RanGAP1 promotes metastasis of CRC
caption: A–F The migration and invasion abilities were analyzed in RanGAP1 knockdown
  and overexpressed CRC cells. G Representative mice injected with RanGAP1 knockdown
  DLD1 cells and control cells were measured for CRC lung metastases. H, I Lung from
  nude mice were obtained and analyzed. J–L The HE-staining detected the expression
  of the metastatic nodules of lung in the different groups.
