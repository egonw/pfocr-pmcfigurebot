figure_title: IL-6-specific up-regulation of LCN2 is dependent on STAT3 activation
  in human CRC cells
caption: (A) After stimulation with 50 ng/ml IL-6 for the indicated time, cytosolic
  and nuclear extracts of DLD-1 cells were prepared and used to determine the translocation
  of p-STAT3. Actin and lamin B were used as loading controls. (B) After transfection
  with LCN2 siRNA, DLD-1 cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml IL-6. Then the level
  of LCN2 in cytosol and p-STAT3 in the nucleus were analyzed by Western blotting.
  Actin and lamin B were used as loading controls. (C) The cells were stimulated after
  transfection with STAT3 siRNA, then the level of LCN2 and p-STAT3 were analyzed
  by Western blotting (upper panel). After pretreatment with 5 μM stattic (STAT3-specific
  inhibitor), the cells were stimulated with IL-6. Then, the level of LCN2 and p-STAT3
  were detected using Western blotting analysis (lower panel). Actin was used as a
  loading control. All images are representatives from at least three independent
  experiments.
