caption: 'miR‐769‐5p promotes ubiquitin‐mediated p53 protein degradation in GC cells.
  (A) KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the target genes of differentially expressed
  miRNAs are enriched in the p53 pathway. (B) Western blot analysis of expression
  level of p53 protein in in BGC NC, BGC mimic‐769 and BGC inhibitor‐769. (C) qRT‐PCR
  detected the expression level of p53 mRNA in BGC NC, BGC mimic‐769 and BGC inhibitor‐769.
  (D) UbiBrowser website predicted E3 ubiquitination ligase with p53 as a substrate.
  (E) Western blot analysis of p53 protein level of 100 μg/ml treated with cycloheximide
  (CHX) changes with treatment time (0, 1, 4 h). (F) Analysis of p53 protein level
  by Western blot in BGC nc and BGC inhibitor‐769 after treatment of MG‐132 (10 μm)
  for 6 h. (G) Western blot analysis of p53 protein expression level after transfection
  of E3 ubiquitinated ligase specific small interfering RNA (siRNA): siITCH, siFBXO11,
  siNEDD4L, siMIB1 and siMIB2. (H) Co‐IP detected the interaction between NEDD4L and
  p53 in GC cells. (I and K) The expression of NEDD4L and p53 protein levels when
  miR‐769‐5p is knocked down or overexpressed. (J) Co‐IP and Western blot detected
  p53 ubiquitination modification mediated by NEDD4L. (L and M) Western blot and qRT‐PCR
  verified the negatively regulatory effects of miR‐769‐5p on RNF20. (N) Predicted
  binding sites of the RNF20 3′UTR by miR‐769‐5p. (O) Luciferase reporter was carried
  out in HEK293T co‐transducted with miR‐769‐5p‐mimics or miRNA control with pGL3‐RNF20‐WT
  or pGL3‐RNF20‐MUT. Quantitative data from three independent experiments are shown
  as the mean ± SD (error bars). *p < .05, **p < .01, ***p < .001 (Student''s t‐test)'
