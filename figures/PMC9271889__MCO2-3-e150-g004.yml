caption: Targeting the autophagy‐lysosome pathway as novel therapeutic strategies
  for COVID‐19. The replication cycle of SARS‐CoV‐2 consists of six consecutive steps,
  as well as the cross‐talks of this cycle with the autophagy–lysosome pathway are
  presented. The red boxes indicate that the lysosomotropic agents targeting the autophagy–lysosome
  pathway are under development as therapeutics against COVID‐19
