caption: (A) Cell proliferation on the scaffolds. (B–E) Osteogenic differentiation
  on the scaffolds. The osteogenic gene markers BMP2, Runx2 and OCN were determined
  using quantitative PCR and western-blotting. (F) FAK-Wnt signaling pathways related
  genes expression of MC3T3-E1 cells cultured on different cements with/without FAK
  inhibitor Mean ± SD; significant difference compared with the control group, *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01.
article_title: Carboxymethyl chitosan-alginate enhances bone repair effects of magnesium
