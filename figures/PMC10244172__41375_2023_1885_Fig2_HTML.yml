figure_title: MCL-PDLS transcriptome recapitulates lymph node hallmarks
caption: A Volcano plot representing the differentially expressed genes (DEG) comparing
  PDLS after 7 days of culture with the original MCL peripheral blood (MCL-PB) sample.
  DEG were obtained by a paired (n = 4) DESeq2 analysis (FDR < 0.1 and absolute log2FC > 0.5).
  B Heatmap of DEG for the individual patients (n = 4). C Signature score of MCL hallmark
  pathways as described by Saba and Rosenwald [, ]. Values were calculated as the
  geometric mean of the normalized counts for the genes involved in each pathway.
  For each significantly upregulated gene set, the leading genes are represented in
  a heatmap. D Bubble plot representing the most significant and representative GSEA
  pathways upregulated in MCL-PDLS compared to MCL-PB.

  lymph node signaling, immune profile and in vivo ibrutinib responses.
