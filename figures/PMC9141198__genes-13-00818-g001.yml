caption: Coding potential and expression profile of lncR-133a. (a) Bioinformatics
  analysis of the coding potential of lncR-133a, and Myod1 and linc-MD1 served as
  controls. (b) qRT-PCR analysis of lncR-133a expression in heart, liver, spleen,
  lung, kidney, and longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LTL) muscle on day 60 of gestation.
  (c) The expression pattern of lncR-133a in the developmental LTL muscle. (d) The
  expression levels of lncR-133a during goat MuSC differentiation. Data are means
  Â± standard error of the mean of at least three biological replicates, * p < 0.05.
