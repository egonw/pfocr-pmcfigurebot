caption: 'The changes in nuclear morphology were tested by DAPI staining after treatment
  with NAC (1000×). Note: (A): negative control group; (B): treated with 5 μmol/L
  PPI for 12 h; (C): treated with 3.5 μmol/L PPI for 24 h; (D): only treated with
  NAC; (E): treated with NAC and 5 μmol/L PPI for 12 h; (F): treated with NAC and
  3.5 μmol/L PPI for 24 h. Arrows indicate the apoptotic cells.'
