caption: Schematic diagram of molecular events via signaling in response to S antigen
  and deciphering a probable pathway for the action of UDSP therein. Internalization
  of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction of S antigen and ACE2 receptor within the host cell
  initiates a lot of molecular events including inhibition of the conversion of ANG
  2 to ANG (1–7), accumulation of ANG2 stimulates overexpression of cytokines 1L-1β
  via NLRP inflammasome, TNFα, IL-6, etc. These cytokines translocate to ECM to create
  a cytokine storm in the extracellular space during the infection. TNFα mediates
  upregulation of transcription factors and intermediates which upregulates MMP-9
  synthesis. ANG2 directly stimulates and MMP-9 synthesis via regulation of AP-1 and
  NFκβ. After activation, MMP-9 gets secreted to ECM and mediates tissue degradation
  and fibrosis. Treatment with UDSP inhibited cytokine storm by reducing the synthesis
  of 1L-1β, IL-6, TNFα, ACE2 mediated virus internalization, MMP-9 synthesis; thereby
  mitigating inflammation and subsiding the infection. Green inhibition sign denotes
  treatment with UDSP and red inhibition sign denotes infection.
