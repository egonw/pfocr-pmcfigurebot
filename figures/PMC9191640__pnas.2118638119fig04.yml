caption: Engineering the archaeal methanogen M. maripaludis for production of bioplastic
  and monomers from CO2 and H2. Production of 3HB or PHB was measured after 14 d of
  growth in McNA minimal medium and was quantified by HPLC–ultraviolet visible detector.
  Strain 1 was grown in McCas (1A), McNA (1B), and McNA-Ala (1C) media, while the
  remaining strains were grown in McNA medium. Strains 2, 3, and 4 used PhaB from
  Halomonas bluephagenesis as an NADH-dependent ketoreductase to make the (R)-stereoisomer
  of 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA as a precursor to PHB; TesB was expressed to make the free
  3-hydroxyacid, R-3HB. Strains 5 through 9 were used a biosynthetic pathway for PHB
  production directly from acetyl-CoA. Nicotinamide was used as a supplement for conditions
  with the indicated concentration. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001, two-tailed
  Student’s t test. All data are reported as mean ± SD of biological replicates (n
  = 3).
