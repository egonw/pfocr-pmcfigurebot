figure_title: Loss of ERMES strongly affects mitochondrial morphology
caption: (A) Yeast cells were grown to log phase in galactose medium before 960 ng/ml
  ATc was added for 16 h. Cells were embedded, cut into thin slices, and visualized
  by transmission electron microscopy. (B) The indicated strains expressing a matrix-targeted
  mNeonGreen (Su9-mNeonGreen) and an ER-targeted mScarlet (Scarlet-TA) were grown
  to log phase in galactose medium before 960 ng/ml ATc was added for 16 h. Afterwards,
  cells were harvested and imaged using a Leica Dmi8 Thunder imager. (C) Cells of
  the indicated strains were grown on galactose in the presence of ATc for 16 h. The
  induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR) was measured by qPCR based on HAC1
  splicing. Wild-type strains treated for 1 h with either DTT or tunicamycin served
  as positive controls. .
