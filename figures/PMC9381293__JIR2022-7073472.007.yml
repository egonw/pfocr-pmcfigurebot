caption: 'GSEA analysis of PRC1 co-expressing genes and the prognostic signature of
  immune system-related genes. (a) Identification of enriched gene sets by GSEA analysis:
  kinesins; immune system; PLK1, FOXM1, and Aurora B pathway; cell cycle; and RHO
  GTPase. OS analysis (b) and PFS analysis (c) of the gene signatures which were associated
  with the immune system according to the GSEA analysis. The left panel showed the
  curve of risk score, survival status of the patients, and the heat map of the expression
  profiles of the prognostic genes in the low- and high-risk group. The right upper
  panel showed the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of the gene signature. The right
  lower panel showed the time-dependent ROC analysis of the gene signature.'
