caption: 'IWR‐1 inhibits the osteogenic differentiation of the TLFCs with stable expression
  of LGR5. (A) the effects of IWR‐1 on LGR5 and β‐catenin expression levels in the
  primary thoracic ligamentum flavum cells (TLFCs) without LGR5 overexpression were
  measured via qRT‐PCR; *p < 0.05 vs. blank group, # p < 0.05 vs. Lv‐NC group; (B)
  the effect of IWR‐1 on the LGR5 and β‐catenin protein levels; (C and D) the effects
  of IWR‐1 on LGR5, Wnt related genes and osteogenic markers expression levels were
  analysed after Lv‐LGR5 transfection via qRT‐PCR; *p < 0.05 vs. Lv‐LGR5 group; (E)
  the effects of IWR‐1 on the protein levels of LGR5 and Wnt related genes determined
  via Western blot analysis; F, ALP staining following the IWR‐1 treatment; the scale
  bar represents 500 μm'
