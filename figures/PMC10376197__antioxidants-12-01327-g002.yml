caption: 'Signaling pathway activated by redox TRP channels in cancer cell proliferation.
  (1) TRPM2 activates mitochondria and transcription factors: HIF-1/2Î±, Nrf2, ATF4,
  and CREB; induces acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells proliferation. Magenta connectors
  indicate this pathway. (2) Illustrated in blue connectors, this pathway shows that
  Ca2+ uptake by TRPM2 promotes survival of neuroblastoma cells. Nrf2 activates the
  antioxidant response and cofactors GSH, NADPH, and NADH. (3) ROS activates TRPM2-S
  and consecutively increases apoptosis and decreases proliferation in retroperitoneal
  liposarcoma (RPLS) cells, through AKT/MAPK pathways as depicted with scarlet connectors.
  (4) Agonists of TRPM7 stimulate ROS production and minimize mitochondrial turnover.
  The connections between TRPM7, ROS production, and consecutive reduction in autophagy
  and proliferation are displayed with green connectors.'
