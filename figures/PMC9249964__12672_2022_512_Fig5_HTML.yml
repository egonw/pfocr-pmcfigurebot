caption: miR-1307-5p effects were mediated by—MDM4 and the Hippo pathway. A Western
  blotting of LATS1 and YAP in 5637 and T24 cells. B Western blotting of MDM4 protein
  in 5637-anti-miR-1307-5p cells—transfected with siMDM4. C Proliferation of 5637-anti-miR-1307-5p
  cells transfected with siMDM4 as determined by CCK-8 assay. D Cell cycle of 5637-anti-miR-1307-5p
  cells transfected with siMDM4 as determined by flow cytometry assay with PI staining.
  E Flow cytometry assay with Annexin V and PI staining—to determine the effects of
  MDM4 on the cell apoptosis of bladder cancer cells. F MDM4 knockdown decreased the
  expression of Ki-67, PCNA, YAP and increased the levels of cleaved caspase3, caspase9,
  LATS1 in 5637-anti-miR-1307-5p cells. **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001;
  ns, no significance. Data depicts the mean ± standard deviation and are representative
  of three independent experiments.
