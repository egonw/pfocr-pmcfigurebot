caption: 'Enrichment analysis of SMYDs and similar gene functions in gastric cancer
  patients (Metascape). (a) The heat map of GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of SMYDs
  and 100 genes related to them is colored based on the p value. (b, (c) Term-enriched
  networks: clusters were colored based on cluster IDs, where nodes sharing the same
  cluster ID are often close to each other, colored based on p value, and terms containing
  more genes tend to have more significant p values. (d, (e) Associated protein interaction
  networks and MCODE components in SMYDs; the pathway and process enrichment analyses
  were independently applied to each MCODE component, and the three descriptions with
  the best p values were retained as functional descriptions of the corresponding
  components. The corresponding network diagram is shown in the table below.'
