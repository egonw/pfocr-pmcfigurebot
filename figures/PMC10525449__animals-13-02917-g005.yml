caption: Identifying the crucial pathways and genes involved in cell proliferation
  and anti-inflammation. (A–F) Performing gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on IPEC-J2
  transcriptomics data ranked from the glutamine treatment group (red) to the control
  group (blue) reveals significant enrichment in various pathways, including cell
  cycle, focal adhesion, TNF signaling pathway, DNA replication initiation, DNA replication,
  and ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity. (G) Venn plot illustrates the intersecting
  genes among the six crucial pathways. (H) The protein–protein association network
  of the intersection genes displays nodes representing the genes, with the size of
  each node indicating the number of connections (degree). Larger node sizes indicate
  a higher number of connections.
