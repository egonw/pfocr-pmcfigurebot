caption: 'Effect of curcumin supplementation on the weight-loaded swimming capacity
  (A) and energy metabolic enzymes. (B) Pyruvate kinase, PK; (C) Hepatic glycogen;
  (D) Muscle glycogen; (E) Succinate dehydrogenase, SDH; (F) Malate dehydrogenase,
  MDH; (G) Na+-K+-ATPase; (G) Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase. Differences were analyzed with one-way
  ANOVA and Duncan''s new multiple range test. a–e Different letters mean significant
  difference (P < 0.05). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E.M. (n = 6). The abbreviation
  of groups used in the figure were: blank control (Rest), swimming control (Con),
  Vitamin C (Vc), low-dose curcumin (C50), middle-dose curcumin (C100), and high-dose
  curcumin (C200).'
