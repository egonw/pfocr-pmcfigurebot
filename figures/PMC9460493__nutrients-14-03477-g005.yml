caption: 'IH had significant antioxidant activities. Compared with vehicle-treated
  HFD-fed mice, IH decreased the levels of (A) ROS and (B) MDA in the liver. (C) IH
  influenced the Nrf2/NF-κB pathway in the livers of HFD-fed mice. IH administration
  decreased the phosphorylation levels of NF-κB, IKKα + β, and IκBα and increased
  the levels of Nrf2, HO-1, and SOD-1 in the livers of HFD-fed mice. Quantification
  data were normalized to GAPDH or the corresponding total protein concentration and
  expressed as the percentage of vehicle-treated NCD-fed mice. Data were analyzed
  using a one-way ANOVA and expressed as the means ± SD (n = 3). # p < 0.05, ## p
  < 0.01, and ### p < 0.001 versus vehicle-treated NCD-fed mice; * p < 0.05, ** p
  < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 versus vehicle-treated HFD-fed mice.'
