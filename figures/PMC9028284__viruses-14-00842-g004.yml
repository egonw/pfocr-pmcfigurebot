caption: HuNoV promotes AQP1 expression through NF-κB signaling pathway. (A,B). HuNoV
  promoted the activation of NF-κB-responsive promoter. (C,D). VP1 promoted the activation
  of NF-κB-responsive promoter. Caco2 cells were transfected with PRD(III-I)4-Luc
  or NF-κB-Luc for 4 h followed by stimulation with or without 100 HAU mL−1 SeV, or
  co-transfected with empty vector, full-length HuNoV cDNA (A,B) or VP1 (C,D)-expressing
  plasmid and PRD(III-I)4-Luc or NF-κB-Luc. (E–H). HuNoV and VP1 promoted the expression
  of AQP1 through NF-κB signaling pathway. Caco2 cells were transfected with empty
  vector or full-length HuNoV cDNA (E) or VP1 (G)-expressing plasmid. The inhibitor
  BX795 or BAY 11-7082 were added at 4 h post-transfection. At 24 h post-transfection,
  the expression of AQP1 was detected by WB (E,G) and quantified using Image J (F,H).
  (I–N). p65 knockdown blocked HuNoV or VP1-induced AQP1 expression. Caco2 cells were
  transfected with or without different p65 specific shRNA or control shRNA (p65 shRNA
  N) (I,J). The knockdown effect of p65 shRNA was detected by WB (I) and quantified
  using Image J (J). p65 specific shRNA or p65 shRNA N was chosen to be transfected
  into Caco2 cells. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were transfected with empty vector
  or full-length HuNoV cDNA (K) or VP1 (M)-expressing plasmid for 24 h. The expression
  of AQP1 was detected by WB (K,M) and quantified using Image J (L,N). Data shown
  are mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments with each condition performed in
  triplicate. One representative experiment out of three is shown. * p < 0.05, ***
  p < 0.001, ns, not significantly. N, negative control.
