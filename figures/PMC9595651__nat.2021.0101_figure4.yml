caption: Pathway enrichment analysis of (a) combined proteomic analysis following
  EGFR ASO 16, 18, and 21 treatment compared with standard ASO control (STD) in PC9
  cells. Comparable pathway enrichment was observed following (b) direct inhibition
  of EGFR using erlotinib treated relative to STD. Analysis was performed using the
  DE proteins. Figures represent pathways that enriched for increased (red) and decreased
  (blue) protein expression. All pathways have negative log10 P values >10. DE, differentially
  expressed.
