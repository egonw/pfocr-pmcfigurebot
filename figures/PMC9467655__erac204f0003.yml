caption: 'TaMYB31 activates promoters of genes from the benzoxazinoid pathway. TaMYB31
  protein and Bx gene promoter interactions were evaluated using a dual fluorescence
  system based on transient expression. Background promoter activity was assayed by
  infiltration of the same empty vector for each gene without a TaMYB31 cassette.
  Promoter sequences of the following genes were analyzed: IGPS3 (TraesCS7B02G423900),
  Bx1 (TraesCS7B02G294800), Bx3 (TraesCS5B02G007200), Bx4a (TraesCS5A02G008800), Bx4b
  (TraesCS5B02G007100), Bx8/9 (TraesCS7B02G016800), and TaKCS1 (KU737579). Shown are
  means of the GFP/RFP reporters ratio ±SE. Asterisks indicate a significant difference
  by Student’s t-test: *P<0.05; ***P<0.001 (n=5). In this figure, a single independent
  biological experiment is presented.'
