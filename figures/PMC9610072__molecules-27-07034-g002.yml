caption: 'Griseofulvin biosynthetic pathway. The nonreducing polyketide synthase gsfA
  initiates the synthesis of griseofulvin by combining one acetyl-CoA and six malonyl-CoA
  units to form the heptaketide backbone of benzophenone 5a. The O-methyltransferases
  (gsfB and gsfC) then methylate phenols on benzophenone 5a to generate the intermediate
  griseophenone C. Following this process, griseophenone C is chlorinated by the halogenase
  gsfI to produce griseophenone B, and griseophenone B is then converted to the grisan
  core by phenol oxidative activity of gsfF. The grisan core is ultimately converted
  into griseofulvin by two further processes: enoyl reduction catalyzed by gsfE and
  methylation at 5-OH mediated by gsfD. Created by Biorender.com.'
