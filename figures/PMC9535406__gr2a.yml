caption: 'Active Tgfbs and Smad signaling pathway elements changes in cerebellar primordium
  during early developmental stages at E9-E13 (n = 3).A, B) Tgfb1 highly expressed
  during earliest embryonic days at E9 and E10. Its expression levels decreased significantly
  with considerable differences from E11 to E13 (A). Tgfb2 values experienced almost
  the same expression pattern as Tgfb1, with higher and lower amounts at E9-E10 and
  E11-E13, respectively. However, the changing expression pattern of Tgfb2 is not
  statistically significant (B). C, D) mRNA expression of Tgfbr1 and Tgfbr2 were measured
  by RT-qPCR. Tgfbr1 transcription at E9 is higher with a significant reduction at
  E12 (C). mRNA values of Tgfbr2 maintained at the same level with no significant
  changes from E9- E13 (D) (The significance of the receptor expression was compared
  to E9 and the relative expression was compared to β-actin (universal gene control).
  E-G) Downregulation of total Smad2 & 3 and confirmation of Smad2 and Smad3 protein
  phosphorylation in E12 and E13. Anti-total Smad2 & 3 reactive bands in Western blot
  analyses (E) and quantification of total Smad2 &3; Total Smad2 and 3 values upregulated
  at E9 and E10, compared to their correspondent controls, with a non-significant
  reduction from E11 to E13 (F). Anti-phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad 3 showed its phosphorylation
  in E12 and E13 (G). The blots were quantified compared to the TGF-β1 treated cells
  using densitometry software Alpha Ease FC. The protein loading was confirmed using
  B-actin. The data in the bar graphs are presented as the mean ± SEM, and statistical
  analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA (P-Value > 0.05, considered as non significant,
  P-value ≤ 0.05 and lower were considered statistically significant. ** shows P < 0.01,
  **** shows P < 0.0001). H-M) Distribution of the Tgfb1 & 2, Tgfbr1 & 2, and Smad2
  & 3 in the cerebellar primordium at E11.5, and E13.5. All images show cerebellar

  H) Tgfb1 was only detected at E11.5 in pia mater of the cerebellar primordium and
  very low level in the neuroepithelium and tela choroidea. I) ISH patterns of Tgfb2
  on sections at E11.5, and E13.5 were not detectable. J) Sagittal sections show dynamic
  expression of Tgfbr1 express at both E11.5 and E13.5 which is detected in nuclear
  transitory zone (NTZ) at E11.5 with higher levels of expression in the NTZ and Purkinje
  cell palate at E13.5. K) Tgfbr2 expression is not detected at any given time points.
  L) Smad2 expression is strongly high throughout the whole cerebellar primordium
  at E11.5. No expression is detected at E13.5. M) Smad3 has moderate expression in
  the cerebellar primordium mainly in the Purkinje cell plate and rhombic lip of the
  cerebellar primordium at E11.5, but not at E13.5.'
