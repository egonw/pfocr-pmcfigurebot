caption: 'Cell‐ECM adhesion regulates distinct patterns of gene expression: A,B) Scatterplot
  of differentially expressed genes between HKs cultured on 20 and 50 µm islands at
  4 and 24 h. Highlighted in blue are DESeq2 significantly differentially expressed
  genes (alpha 0.05). C) Unsupervised hierarchical clustering plot of all samples
  with highlighted cluster of interest (cluster 15). D) Three most enriched GO terms
  of genes upregulated on 20 µm, upregulated on 50 µm, and within cluster 15. E) Differential
  expression of genes associated with the ribogenesis pathway in HKs grown on micropatterned
  islands after 24 h expressed as Log2 (transcripts on 50 µm islands/transcripts on
  20 µm islands). F,G) Relative expression levels of 47S pre‐ribosomal RNA as quantified
  from qPCR and de novo protein synthesis levels as quantified by normalized integrated
  intensity measurements of epifluorescence microscopy images of nascent proteins.
  Data represent mean ± SEM, N = 3 experiments. *p‐value < 0.05 (two‐tail t‐test for
  47S qPCR and 2‐way ANOVA, Tukey multiple comparisons test for de novo protein synthesis).'
