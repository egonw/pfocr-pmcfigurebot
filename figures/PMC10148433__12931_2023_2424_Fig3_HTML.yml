caption: MERTK-overexpressing macrophages enhance efferocytosis function through the
  Ucp2/mitochondrial signalling pathway. A After coculturing apoptotic cells with
  vector- and MERTK-macrophages, the ratio and capacity of macrophage efferocytosis
  were detected by flow cytometry. Macrophages were pre-gated on CD68 + area, ratio
  and capacity of macrophage efferocytosis were measured by CFSE-positive ratio (CFSE + /CFSE + CD68 +)
  and MFI of CFSE, respectively (n = 6). B The protein expression of MERTK and Ucp2
  in lung macrophages was detected by WB (n = 3–5 samples per group). C Mitochondrial
  membrane potential of vector- and MERTK-macrophages was measured by flow cytometry
  (n = 6). Data were presented as mean ± SEM. T-tests or Mann–Whitney tests were used
  for two-group (Vector and MERTK) comparsions. *p < 0.05; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001;

  and results in defective regulation of efferocytosis function in pulmonary fibrosis.
