caption: Overexpression of ELDR induces FOXM1-AURKA signaling.A, relative mRNA expression
  of AURKA, PLK1, CDC25C, CDK1, and CCNB1 in ELDR-overexpressed NOK was analyzed by
  qRT-PCR as compared to NOK. 18S rRNA was used as an internal control. Small bar
  indicates standard error (∗∗∗p < 0.001). Experiments were repeated three times with
  technical triplicates. B, control or ELDR-overexpressed NOK lysates were subjected
  to Western blot analysis for AURKA and (C) phospho-CDK1 and total CDK1 (Cdc2) using
  specific antibodies. The membranes were reprobed with actin as an internal control.
  Right panel shows quantitation. Small bar indicates standard error (∗p < 0.05).
  Experiments were repeated two times. D, the expression of AURKA and FOXM1 was shown
  (red dots) among a total 15,219 genes in the Volcano plot generated from the RNA
  seq data of NOK-ELDR versus NOK. Horizontal and vertical dashed red lines represent
  absolute 2-fold change and p-value 0.05 as the threshold cut-off. E, AURKA and FOXM1
  pathway genes are strongly upregulated in ELDR-expressing NOK cells. Gene set enrichment
  analysis was performed using the “fgsea” R package with genes ranked based on their
  differential expression in NOK-ELDR and control NOK cells against the Pathway Interaction
  Database (PID). The AURORA A (AURKA) and FOXM1 pathways were among the upregulated
  pathways in cells expressing ELDR. F, relative mRNA expression of FOXM1 in ELDR-overexpressed
  NOK analyzed by qRT-PCR as compared to NOK. 18S rRNA was used as an internal control.
  Small bar indicates standard error (∗∗∗p < 0.001). Experiments were repeated three
  times with technical triplicates. G, NOK-ELDR cells were transfected with two different
  siRNAs to ELDR and after 48 h mRNA expression of ELDR, FOXM1, and AURKA were analyzed
  by qRT-PCR. 18S rRNA was used as an internal control. Relative gene expression is
  shown with mean value ±standard error (∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01). Experiments were
  repeated three times with technical triplicates. AURKA, Aurora kinase A; CCNB1,
  cyclin B1; CDC25C, cell division cycle 25C; CDK1, cyclin-dependent kinase 1; EGFR,
  epidermal growth factor receptor; ELDR, EGFR long noncoding downstream RNA; FOXM1,
  Forkhead box M1; NOK, normal oral keratinocytes; NOK-ELDR, NOKs stably expressing
  ELDR; PLK1, Polo-like kinase 1; qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time reverse transcription
  PCR.
