caption: DEGs in terpenoid biosynthesis of sacred lotus. Typical terpenoid biosynthetic
  pathway with homology heat map of gene transcription level in transcriptome data
  with substrates and products. The arrows connect the substrate to their corresponding
  product. The expression pattern of each unigene is displayed in a six-column grid;
  from left to right are seed, young leaf, mature leaf, red flower, white flower,
  and yellow flower. Transcript-level data is represented by FPKM. AACT, Acetyl-CoA
