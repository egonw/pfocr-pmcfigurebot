caption: The related mechanism of ferroptosis and periodontitis. Glutamate acid and
  cystine are exchanged in a ratio of 1:1 inside and outside cells, and cystine is
  reduced to participate in GSH synthesis, activate GPX4, and inhibit ROS production.
  When VDAC was opened, NADPH production increased, which provided reduced hydrogen
  for GSH formation but increased ROS production. Tf combines with Tfr and merges
  into cells, and is introduced into the cytoplasm by DMT1, and exists in two forms
  of ferritin and free iron. Ferritin autophagy occurs through NCOA4, which increases
  the content of free iron, causes Fenton reaction and increases ROS. Under oxidative
  stress, NRF2 initiates the expression of GPX4, HO-1 and ferritin heavy chain, but
  at the same time, HO-1 can decompose heme to produce ferrous iron. P53 not only
  inhibits the expression of SLC7A11 but can also target PTGS2, promote prostaglandin
  synthesis, and damage periodontium. Glutamate was prepared by hydrolysis of glutamine
  catalyzed by GLS2. LOX promotes the formation of lipid peroxidation in cells. MAPK
  pathway and hippo pathway promote each other, NF2 activates hippo, activates LATS1/2,
  phosphorylates YAP and inhibits the expression of downstream ACSL4. In periodontitis,
  inflammatory factors IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α can promote the deposition of unsaturated
  fatty acids, which are acylated by AcSL4, integrated to cell membrane by LPCAT3,
  and become an important substance of iron death after being oxidized by LOX. TGF-β1
  during periodontal bone formation can inhibit the expression of SLC7A11 through
  Smad3. Abbreviations—Tf, transferrin; TFR, transferrin receptor; DMT1, divalent
