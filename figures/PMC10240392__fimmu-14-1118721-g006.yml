caption: Knockout of epithelial specific MyD88/NF-ĸB signaling reprograms COPD-associated
  protumorigenic inflammatory phenotype into an antitumorigenic phenotype. Total inflammatory
  cell and lineage-specific leukocyte numbers from BALF (n=5-7) (A). Relative mRNA
  expression of CXCL1, CCL2, IFNG, TNF, GZMB, IL1B, IL17, and RETNLB in whole lungs,
  normalized by CD45 expression (n=4-5) (B-I). Data represent mean ± SEM; experimental
  groups are separately compared to CC-LR cohort, where "*", "#", "+" denote p< 0.05
  by unpaired t-test of Total WBC, Macrophages, and Neutrophils respectively.
article_title: Toll-like receptors 2, 4, and 9 modulate promoting effect of COPD-like
  airway inflammation on K-ras-driven lung cancer through activation of the MyD88/NF-ĸB
  pathway in the airway epithelium.
