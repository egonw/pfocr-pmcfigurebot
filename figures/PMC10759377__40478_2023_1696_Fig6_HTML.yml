caption: EP300/CBP KD results in downregulation of amyloid-reducing compensatory pathway
  in APPDup neurons. A Schematic of analyzed APP processing pathway genes and their
  functions within the APP processing pathway. B Amyloid-β reduction and α-secretase
  pathway activation genes are upregulated in APPDup vs. NDC neurons. Heatmap comparing
  gene expression of APP processing pathway genes across all APPDup and NDC CTRL RNAi-treated
  neurons. C, D Amyloid-reducing genes including those upregulated in APPDup neurons
  are downregulated upon EP300/CBP KD in APPDup neurons (C). Fewer amyloid-reducing
  genes are downregulated upon EP300/CBP KD in NDC neurons (D). E Aβ42 secretion is
  increased upon EP300/CBP KD in APPDup but not NDC neurons. Media from EP300, CBP,
  and CTRL siRNA-treated day 21 neurons was collected and measured via ELISA and measured
  Aβ42 abundance was normalized to total media protein measured by BCA. F, G EP300/CBP
  KD does not affect neuron viability or cell count. Day 21 neurons were collected
  and stained with trypan blue and under counted via hemocytometer microscopy; trypan-blue
  negativity (F) and trypan-blue negative cell count (G) were recorded to determine
  viability and cell count number
