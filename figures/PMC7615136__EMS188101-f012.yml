figure_title: AHR-dependent regulation of the apelin signalling pathway in lung endothelia
caption: a, Heatmap of indicated genes from RNA sequencing data comparing CD31+ lung
  endothelial cells on day 6 post infection (fold change > 1.5, padj < 0.05). b, Expression
  of indicated genes in isolated CD45+ immune cell, EpCam+ epithelial cell, and CD31+
  endothelial cell was determined by qPCR in naïve WT mice (n = 4). c, d, Expression
  of indicated genes in UMAP plots of mouse (c) and human (d) lung scRNA-seq datasets
  obtained from lungendothelialcellatlas.com. e, Lung vascular leakage was assessed
  in PBS (n = 5) and apelin (n = 6) treated ECΔAhr mice by quantification of total
  cells Ter119+ RBCs in the BALF on day 6 post infection. f, Dot plot of hallmark
  pathways enriched or downregulated in MM54-treated WT mice (relative to PBS-treated
  controls) by GSEA. Comparisons are between MM54-treated and untreated from influenza
  infected mice, for endothelia and epithelia (two pairwise comparisons total). Dot
  size relates to statistical significance. All Data are representative of at least
  two independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using one-sided
  Wald test with Benjamini–Hochberg correction (a) or followed by Tukey’s post-test
  (b), or unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test (e). NES were generated with GSEA using
  a two-sided Kolmogorov Smirnov statistic with Hallmark genesets on genelists ranked
  by the Wald t statistic from DESeq2 (f) and significant P values are indicated on
  the graphs. Data are shown as mean±SEM. ns, not significant.
