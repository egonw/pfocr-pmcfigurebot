caption: Classical, lectin, and alternative complement pathways and triggers for activationThe
  classical, lectin, and alternative complement pathways and the triggers for activation
  (described in detail elsewhere). The 3 complement pathways converge to generate
  C3 convertases that cleave C3, creating C3a and C3b. C3b is a major effector molecule
  of the complement system. C3b binds covalently to the surface of nearby cells, opsonizes
  the cells for phagocytosis, and initiates the reactions that lead to the formation
  of the membrane attack complex (C5–9). Bystander host cells are protected from excessive
  complement activation by cell-bound and circulating complement regulatory proteins.
  The alternative pathway also has the unique ability to serve as an amplification
  system for the classical and lectin pathways. In this study, we examined the complement
  activation fragment C3a, which can arise from activation of any of the 3 complement
  pathways and also Bb. The Bb activation fragment is primarily associated with alternative
  complement pathway activation but can also arise as a result of activation of initiation
  of the complement cascade by the classical or lectin pathways through the alternative
  complement pathway amplification loop. Bb is a protease generated during the sequential
  activation of both the alternative pathway and the activation loop and is required
  for further steps of the pathway. The alternative pathway and amplification loop
  are reviewed in detail elsewhere.–Reprinted, with permission, from Lynch.
