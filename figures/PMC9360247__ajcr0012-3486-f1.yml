caption: The cytotoxic effects of Econazole and Adriamycin in ADR and sensitive breast
  cancer cell lines. A. Econazole (1, 3, 10, and 30 μM) efficiently decreased the
  viability of ADR breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231/ADR and MCF-7/ADR) at 24, 48, and
  72 hours, as measured by MTT assays. Interestingly, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were
  not sensitive to low concentrations (<10 μM) of Econazole. B. Adriamycin (1, 3,
  10, and 30 μM) efficiently decreased the viability of sensitive breast cancer cells
  (MDA-MB-231and MCF-7) at 24, 48, and 72 hours, as measured by MTT assays. MDA-MB-231/ADR
  and MCF-7/ADR cells showed resistance to low concentrations (<10 μM) of Adriamycin.
  C. The combination of Econazole (0.3-10 μM) and Adriamycin (0.3-10 μM) synergistically
  decreased the viability of ADR breast cancer cells, as measured by MTT assays at
  72 hours. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA (Analysis Of Variance),
  and the difference was considered significant if P<0.05, which is marked with an
  asterisk (*) in the figures.
