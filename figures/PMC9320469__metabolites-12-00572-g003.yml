caption: Pathway-associated metabolite set enrichment analysis (MSEA) for MPS vs.
  CONT. (A) Plot displaying affected biological processes in multigenerationally stressed
  (MPS) compared to non-stressed control (CONT) rats based on metabolites identified
  as significantly different between these groups. The p-value for each pathway is
  indicated in the gradient on the right side. The fold enrichment shows how many
  times greater than chance the pathway is involved. (B) Metabolomic pathway analysis
  showing all matched pathways according to p-values from pathway enrichment analysis
  and pathway impact values from pathway topology analysis in MPS and non-stressed
  CONT rats. The y-axis shows the negative natural log of p, such that a higher value
  on the y-axis gives a lower p-value. The x-axis indicates the pathway impact, which
  correlates to the number of metabolite hits in a particular pathway. Only metabolic
  pathways with p < 0.05 are labeled. MPS had the highest impact on the glycine, serine,
  and threonine metabolism.
