caption: Cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry after staining with Propidium Iodide
  (PI). K562 cells were treated with IC50 concentration (113.54 µg/mL) of CTCBNc for
  24 hours and standard drug Doxorubicin with the concentration of 5 µM/mL compared
  to the control. (a) Cell cycle arrest and distribution of apoptotic cells, (b) Graphical
  representation of the percentage of cells in each phase; ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001 untreated
  cells vs. CuO-TiO2-Chitosan-Berbamine nanocomposites. ∗P < 0.05 untreated cells
  vs. CuO-TiO2-Chitosan-Berbamine nanocomposites treated cells.
