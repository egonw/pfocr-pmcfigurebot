caption: 'AS-IV accelerates the apoptosis of KGN cells by activating PPARγ signaling
  and promoting autophagy. (A) Apoptosis of KGN cells treated with AS-IV in the absence
  or presence of GW9662 or 3-MA, observed through TUNEL. (B) Expression of apoptosis-related
  proteins Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved-caspase3, and cleaved-caspase9 in KGN cells treated
  with AS-IV in the absence or presence of GW9662 or 3-MA, detected by western blot.
  Data are expressed as mean ± SD. ***P<0.001 versus control. ##P<0.01, ###P<0.001
  versus the AS-IV 80 μg/ml group'
