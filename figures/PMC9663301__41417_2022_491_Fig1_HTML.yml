figure_title: Identification of key genes using a shRNA library screen approach
caption: A Schematic representation of the shRNA library screen. RCH-ACV leukemia
  cells (E2A-PBX1+/pre-BCR+) were transduced with shRNA sublibraries. After puromycin
  selection, the frequency of individual shRNAs was quantified at day 0 and at day
  12 by deep sequencing. The experiment was performed in duplicate. B Dot plot shows
  Mann–Whitney U test p values for enrichment (increase proliferation) and depletion
  (decrease proliferation) of targeted genes by shRNA knockdown and analyzed by deep-sequencing.
  Each dot represents a gene. C Small drug screen. RCH-ACV cells were treated with
  several small molecule inhibitors and viable cells were enumerated after four days.
  Graph shows half inhibitory growth concentration (IC50). At least three independent
  experiments were performed per treatment.
