caption: Binding of miR-145-5p to MMP2. (A) miRNAs bound to MMP2 were analyzed using
  miRDB, StarBase and TargetScan. Predicted binding sites between MMP2 and miR-145-5p.
  (B) MMP2, VEGFA and TLR4, were measured using RT-PCR. (C) Luciferase reporter assay
  was conducted to detect luciferase activity. (D) Expression of MMP2 was detected
  by western blot. Results are presented as mean ± SD. NS, no significance; *, P<0.05;
  **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.001. MMP2, matrix metallopeptidase 2; VEGFA, vascular endothelial
  growth factor-A; TLR4, Toll-like receptor 4; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase
  chain reaction; SD, standard deviation; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  NC, negative control.
