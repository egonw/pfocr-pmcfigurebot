figure_title: CD8+ T cells are essential, phenotypically distinct in responding vs.
  nonresponding tumors, and require Type I IFN signaling
caption: (A) CD8+ T cells were depleted from tumor-bearing mice prior to SCRT treatment.
  (B) Tumor burden monitored by IVIS for 20 days. (C) DEGs between responding CD8+
  T cells and nonresponding CD8+ T cells plotted on a hierarchical clustering heatmap.
  Blue box=nonresponders, green=responders, and pink=untreated. (D) Pathway heatmap
  of DEGs. N=5 untreated and 10 irradiated (4 nonresponders, 6 responders) for sequencing
  wildtype CD8+ T cells. (E) CD8+ T cells from d14 irradiated tumors of mice treated
  with IFNAR blocking antibodies or IgG control. N=6 IgG and 5 IFNAR treated. (F)
  Top 30 significantly downregulated pathways of CD8+ T cell from IFNAR-treated mice
  compared to IgG-treated mice. (G) Hierarchical clustering heatmap comparing CD8+
  T cells from SCRT responders (blue box) from WT mice to SCRT nonresponders from
  WT mice including IFNAR treated CD8+ T cells (purple box).
