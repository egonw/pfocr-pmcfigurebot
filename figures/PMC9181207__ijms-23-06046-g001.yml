caption: BA biosynthesis pathways in humans and mice. The classic bile acid biosynthesis
  pathway begins with converting cholesterol to 7α-hydroxycholesterol by CYP7A1 and
  subsequent conversion to C4. C4 is then converted to CA or CDCA by multiple enzymes
  including CYP8B1 and CYP27A1. CA and CDCA are then conjugated with taurine (t-)
  or glycine (g-) by BACS and BAAT. In mice, CDCA is further converted to α-MCA, then
  β-MCA by CYP2C70, which is not present in humans. Alternative pathways are initiated
  by CYP27A1 in the liver, macrophages, and the adrenal gland, cholesterol 25-hydroxylase
  (CH25H) in the liver and CYP46A1 in the brain. Products of the first two pathways
  are further converted by CYP7B1 to different steroidal compounds to produce BAs,
  oxysterols, and steroid hormones. The last pathway is involved in regulating cholesterol
  levels in the brain and the final product by CYP39A1 is delivered to the liver for
  BA synthesis. Red boxes indicate enzymes and BAs in both humans and mice, blue boxes
  indicate BAs mainly in humans, and green boxes indicate enzymes and BAs existing
  only in mice.
