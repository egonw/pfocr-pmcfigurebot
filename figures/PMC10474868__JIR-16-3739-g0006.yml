caption: 'Proliferation of THLE cells (Aa), HepG2 cells (Ab), C3A cells (Ac) and SNU-449
  cells (Ad) after incubation for 48 h in medium supplemented with 20 ng/mL growth
  factors (measured by the BrdU assay). There were significant differences in incorporation
  of BrdU by control and growth factors-treated HepG2 cells (p < 0.001), C3A cells
  (p < 0.001), and SNU-449 cells (p = 0.004). Differences with a p-value ≤ 0.05 were
  defined as statistically significant compared to the control group: one asterisk
  (*), p-value ≤ 0.05; two asterisks (**), p-value ≤  0.01; three asterisks (***),
  p-value ≤  0.001.'
