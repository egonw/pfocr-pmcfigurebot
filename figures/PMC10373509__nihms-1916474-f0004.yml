caption: (a) Presynaptic neuron in the pain pathway releases excitatory neurotransmitters
  into the synaptic cleft activating the postsynaptic neuron. The postsynaptic neuron
  releases endocannabinoids which bind to CB1 receptors on the presynaptic neuron.
  This will act as a negative feedback loop to inhibit the release of excitatory neurotransmitters
  in the presynaptic neuron decreasing the sensation of pain. (b) Endocannabinoids
  bind to CB2 and TRPV1 receptors on immune cells inhibiting the release of the pro-inflammatory
  cytokine, TNF-Î± and activating the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-6,
  IL-1RA, and IL-10.
