caption: Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 virus production by p53. (A) Experimental workflow
  of SARS-CoV-2 infection and measurement of virus production. (B) Immunoblot analysis
  of p53 expression in Vero E6 cells. (C) Vector control and V5-p53 were introduced
  into Vero E6 cells by lentiviral transduction. Two days later, the same number of
  cells was infected with the clinical isolate UF-1 of SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity
  of infection of 0.01 for 1 h. At 72 h post-infection, the supernatants were collected
  and used for the plaque assay on Vero E6 monolayers. Plaque assay was analyzed 72
  h later. The data are based on the average of six independent SARS-CoV-2 infections
  of lentivirus-transduced cells. Dots represent the 6 replicates that were used for
  calculation. Significance was determined using a two-tailed unpaired t-test (****
  p < 0.0001).
