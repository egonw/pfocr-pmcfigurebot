caption: sNASP mutation accelerates the signaling of TLR4–TAK1 pathway in B6.WT mice.
  The phosphorylated and total protein levels were determined by immunoblotting in
  peritoneal macrophages following 0/0.5/1/2 hr stimulation with (a) LPS (1 ng/ml),
  (b) LPS (10 ng/ml), (c) LPS (100 ng/ml). Mouse β-actin was detected as control.
  Data were shown as means ± SEM.  ∗P < 0.05,  ∗∗P < 0.01; independent sample t-test.
  Results shown are representative of 2–3 independent experiments.
