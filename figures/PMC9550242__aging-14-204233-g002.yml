caption: 'Fasudil inhibited the RhoA/ROCK/ERK1/2 signaling pathway in arterial smooth
  muscle tissues of rabbits. (A) A heatmap of the top 200 DEGs in the GSE60887 dataset.
  (B) A volcano map of the top 200 DEGs in the GSE37924 dataset. (C, D) Annotations
  of the GO analysis. (E) Partial results of the KEGG pathway analysis. (Fâ€“I) The
  string revealing the gene-enriched items of biological process. (J) Western blotting
  and quantitative analysis revealed that RhoA, ROCK, and p-ERK1/2 expressions were
  significantly reduced in the arterial smooth muscle tissues in Fasudil group compared
  with those in Model group. P<0.05: Fasudil group vs. Model group vs. Sham group.'
