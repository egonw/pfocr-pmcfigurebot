figure_title: Oct4 promotes PBMSC vitality and long-term survival
caption: 'a The ability of all groups of PBMSCs to form clones was tested by cell
  colony formation assays and crystal violet staining. b Quantitative analysis of
  the number of cell clones in (a). c The growth curve of all groups of PBMSCs at
  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 d. d The viability of PBMSCs after 70 days of culture was
  tested by the MTS method. e Cell morphology senescence-associated β-galactosidase
  staining (black arrowheads) in PBMSCs from all groups. Scale bars = 100 µm. f Quantitative
  analysis of the ratio of senescent PBMSCs to total PBMSCs in (e). g The apoptosis
  level of all groups of PBMSCs was detected by flow cytometry using Annexin V/PI
  staining. All graphical data are shown as the means ± SEMs. P < 0.05: * vs. the
  vehicle group, # vs. the oeβ-catenin group, Δ vs. the shβ-catenin group, n = 10
  in each group.'
