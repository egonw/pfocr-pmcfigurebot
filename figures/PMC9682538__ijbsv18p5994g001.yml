caption: M2 macrophage promote PCa cell proliferation and invasion through direct
  contact. (A, B) Flow cytometry (FCM) detection of THP-1 and PBMC-induced M2 macrophages
  makers. (C) The strategy and schematic diagram for direct coculture and separation
  of TAMs and mCherry-luciferase-labeled DU145 and 22RV1 cells. FACS was used to separate
  tumor cells and TAMs according to the color channel. (D) FCM identified the separated
  tumor cells by detecting mCherry and CD206. (E) Bioluminescence assay of DU145-luc
  and 22RV1-luc. TAMs (THP-1 cells and PBMCs derived) in direct contact increased
  the luminescence values of DU145-luc and 22RV1-luc cells compared with those of
  the noncontact and control groups (left). (F) Quantification data of the cell luminescence
  value (right). (G) Matrigel-based Transwell invasion assay of DU145-luc and 22RV1-luc
  cells. TAMs (THP-1 and PBMC-derived) in direct contact increased the invasive ability
  of DU145-luc and 22RV1-luc cells compared with the noncontact and control groups.
  (H) The quantification data of invasive assay (right) (*p<0.05, **p<0.01).
