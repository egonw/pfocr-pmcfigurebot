caption: (A) Capsaicin treatment caused a time‐dependent reduction in SIRT1 and SOX2
  levels in WB‐F344 cells as detected with western blotting. (B) Following exposure
  of WB‐F344 cells to capsaicin (200 μM) for 4 h, cytosolic and nuclear extracts were
  prepared and subjected to western blotting. α‐Tubulin and Histone‐H3 were used as
  cytosolic and nuclear markers, respectively. (C) WB‐F344 cells were exposed to 200 μmol/L
  capsaicin alone or in combination with MG‐132 (5 μmol/L, 10 μmol/L, 20 μmol/L) for
  3 h, and the protein level of SIRT1 and SOX2 was examined by western blot analysis.
  (D) and (E) Following treatment of WB‐F344 cells with capsaicin (200 μM) alone or
  in combination with MG‐132 (20 μM) for 3 h, the ubiquitination of endogenous SIRT1
  (D) and SOX2 (E) was determined by immunoprecipitation. (F) SIRT1 was immunoprecipitated
  from WB‐F344 cells, and western blot analysis was performed using antibodies for
  SOX2 to investigate direct binding between SIRT1 and SOX2. (G) Following treatment
  of WB‐F344 cells with capsaicin (200 μM) for 3 h, western blotting detected immunoprecipitated
  SOX2 with the use of SOX2 antibody and acetylated SOX2 with the use of acetylated
  lysine antibody to confirm the acetylation status of SOX2
