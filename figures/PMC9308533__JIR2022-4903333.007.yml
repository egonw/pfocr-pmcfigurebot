caption: FKB activates TSPAN12 expression and TGF-β1/SMAD4 pathway in vivo. (a–c)
  Immunohistochemistry results of TGF-β1, SMAD4, and TSPAN12 proteins in gastric cancer
  tissues of FKB treatment and control groups. Bar = 20 μm. (d) Representative images
  of western blot. (e–g) TGF-β1, SMAD4, and TSPAN12 expression was examined in gastric
  cancer tissues of nude mice between FKB treatment and control groups using western
  blot. (h) FKB treatment prolonged the survival time of nude mice xenografted with
  SGC-7901 cells. (i) FKB treatment lowered the tumor weight of nude mice xenografted
  with SGC-7901 cells. ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.
