caption: 'VB regulates neuroinflammation in brains of APP/PS1 mice through NF-κB-p65
  signaling. In the brain of APP/PS1 mice, VB regulated the production of (A) BDNF,
  (B) TGF-β, (C) MCP-1, (D) IL-1β, and (E) IL-6 as determined through ELISA (n = 8);
  lowered the production (F) of IL-1β, IL-6 and iNOS, enhanced that of anti-inflammatory
  factors including IL-4 and IL-10 (n = 3), and blocked (G) the activation of the
  NF-κB-p65 pathway (n = 3). Data from Western blot were quantified via densitometry
  and expressed as the fold of WT group. Results were presented as means ± SEM, #p
  < 0.05, ##p < 0.01 and ###p < 0.001 vs. WT mice, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 and ***
  p < 0.001 vs. APP/PS1 mice.'
