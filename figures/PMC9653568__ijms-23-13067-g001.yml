caption: 'Proteomics analysis of normal pituitary gland and corticotroph adenomas,
  gonadotroph adenomas, and somatotroph adenomas. (A): A heatmap of differentially
  expressed proteins (FC > 1.5 or FC < 0.67 and FDR q < 0.1). High expression is shown
  in red; low expression is shown in blue. (B): Volcano map of differentially expressed
  proteins.** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 (C): KEGG pathway analysis based on differentially
  expressed proteins. (D): The most enriched GO terms. (E): Enrichment analysis in
  TRRUST showing differentially expressed proteins regulated by STAT3, REST, TFAP2A,
  and SNAI1 based on the Metascape database.'
