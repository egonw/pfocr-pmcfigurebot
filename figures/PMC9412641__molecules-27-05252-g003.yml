caption: Metabolism of GSH conjugated product to mercapturic acid conjugated product
  in the mercapturic acid pathway and cysteine S-conjugate β-lyase-dependent bioactivation
  of cysteine S-conjugate. Acetyl-CoA = acetyl coenzyme A; CGDP = cysteinylglycine
  dipeptidase; CoASH = coenzyme A; Glu = glutamic acid; Gly = glycine; H2O = water;
  NAT = N-acetyltransferase; NH4+ = ammonium ion; γ-GT = γ-glutamyl transferase.
