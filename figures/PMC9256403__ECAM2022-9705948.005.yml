caption: 'SKI inhibited activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway: (a) representative
  western blotting analyses, illustrating that SKI reduced the levels of, Snail1,
  TCF4, active β-catenin, β-catenin, PAI-1, and WNT1 protein expression, which are
  involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway; (b–g) graphic presentation of Snail1,
  TCF4, active β-catenin, β-catenin, PAI-1, and WNT1 in the four groups as indicated;
  and (h–l) qRT-PCR revealed that SKI reversed the increased level of Snail1, Tcf4,
  Ctnnb1, PAI-1, and Wnt1mRNA expression.'
