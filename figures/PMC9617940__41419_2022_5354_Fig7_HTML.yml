figure_title: EGFL7/NOTCH signaling pathway promotes resistance to EGFR inhibitors
  in irreversible resistant phase
caption: 'A Western bolt analysis showing the levels of EGFR, pEGFR, NOTCH1-NTM and
  NOTCH1-NCID in PC9OR cells treated with 2 µM osimertinib (Osm) for the indicated
  time points. B Western bolt analysis showing the levels of EGFR, pEGFR, EGFL7, NOTCH1-NTM
  and c-Myc in EGFL7-knockdown PC9OR cells and control cells treated with 2 µM osimertinib
  (Osm) for the indicated time points. GAPDH was set as a loading control. C Survival
  curves of PC9OR cells treated with a combination of different concentrations of
  osimertinib (Osm) and vehicle control (DMSO) or NOTCH signaling inhibitor dibenzazepine
  (DBZ) for 72 h. Data present as average of four identically wells of percentage
  of surviving cells to vehicle-treated control. D Growth curves of tumor xenografts
  derived from PC9OR cells treated with a combination of 3 mg/kg osimertinib (Osm)
  and 1 mg/kg DBZ or vehicle control (DMSO). E Images of xenograft tumors with the
  indicated treatments (upper panel) and statistical analysis of tumor weight (lower
  panel). F Left panel showing the representative images of Ki67 staining in xenograft
  tumors with the indicated treatments, and right panel showing statistical analysis
  of the percentage of Ki67 positive cells. Scale bar: 100 µm. The data in E are average
  value of five biological replicates. The median line in E represents median value.
  The top and bottom of box in E are 25th and 75th percentiles. The data in left panel
  (F) show the representative images of three biological replicates, and the data
  in right panel (F) show the average of three biological replicates. Data are shown
  as mean ± SEM. p values in C, D are calculated by two way ANNOVA, while p values
  in E, F are calculated by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01;
  ***p < 0.001).'
