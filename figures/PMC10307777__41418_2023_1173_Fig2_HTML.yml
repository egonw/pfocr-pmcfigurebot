figure_title: USP28 regulates SREBP2 via close interaction
caption: a U2OS cells expressing inducible shRNA sequences targeting USP28 (shUSP28#1
  and shUSP28#2) or non-targeting control (shRen) were treated with 1 µg/ml of doxycycline
  (DOX) for 72 or 96 h. Protein lysates were analysed for expression of USP28, full
  length (flSREBP2) and mature SREBP2 (mSREBP2) and HMGCS1 by immunoblotting. Actin
  is shown as loading control. b U2OS cells were stained for USP28 and SREBP2 by immunofluorescence.
  DAPI was used to mark nuclei. Cells with low nuclear expression of USP28 and SREBP2
  are marked with arrowheads. c A431 cells were subjected to cell fractionation into
  cytoplasm and nuclei. Fractions were analysed for expression of USP28 as well as
  full length (flSREBP2) and mature SREBP2 (mSREBP2). Calreticulin served as marker
  for ER-membranes, c-Myc and Lamin A/C as markers for nuclei and GAPDH as marker
  for cytoplasm. Unspecific bands for flSREBP2 are marked by asterisks. Two independent
  replicate fractionations are shown. d U2OS cells were analysed by proximity ligation
  assay using antibodies specific for USP28 and SREBP2 either alone or in combination.
  Number of PLA signals per cell were analysed in >42 cells from at least three biologically
  independent samples. Data are presented as mean ± SD (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, one-way
  ANOVA with post-hoc Dunnett’s test). e A431 and U2OS cells were subjected to cross-linking
  with DSP. Cells were fractionated and lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation
  using antibodies detecting SREBP2 or matched immunoglobulin controls (IgG). Input
  and precipitates were analysed for presence of full length and mature SREBP2 as
  well as USP28. IgG bands are marked by asterisks. f Lysates of U2OS cells were subjected
  to immunoprecipitation using antibodies detecting SREBP2 (left) or USP28 (right).
  Precipitates were analysed for presence of full-length and mature SREBP2 as well
  as USP28.
