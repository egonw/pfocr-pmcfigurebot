caption: The androgen receptor (AR) modulates the expression of many important genes
  in the lipid metabolism pathways. Especially sterol regulatory element-binding proteins
  (SREBP) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) are upregulated in an AR-dependent manner.
  The AR activates the expression of the SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP)
  which is needed for SREBP activation. SREBP can induce the activation of FASN, but
  also upregulates cholesterol metabolism by inducing the mevalonate pathway. SREBP
  also acts as an oxygen sensor (via hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)) which helps cells
  to adapt to a hypoxic microenvironment. SREBP increases the expression of AR; thus,
  the AR–SREBP-axis forms a self-regulating loop ensuring the constant gene expression
  of transcription factors. The importance of the regulation of lipid metabolism has
  been demonstrated also in the regulation of tumor-associated immune cells and in
  development of treatment resistances in prostate cancer.
