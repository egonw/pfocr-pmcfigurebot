caption: USP44 is closely related to the occurrence and progression of tumors. USP44
  is closely related to the occurrence and progression of tumors, including glioma,
  gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, non-small
  cell lung cancer, breast cancer, renal clear cell carcinoma, T cell leukemia and
  ovarian cancer. Red arrows indicate increased protein expression, pathway activation,
  increased capacity or disease progression. The blue arrow indicates the opposite
  to the red arrow. Black arrows indicate process progression. USP44, ubiquitin-specific
  peptidase 44; EZH2, zeste homolog 2; H2Bub1, histone H2B K120; FBP, fructose bisphosphatase
  1.
