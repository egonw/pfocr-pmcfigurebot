figure_title: Effect of extrinsic noise in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway
caption: 'A: Extrinsic noise in the system was introduced by considering the effect
  of variability in the initial copy number of the proteins in the pathway. Initial
  conditions were generated by random sampling using a normal distribution  with values
  for μ given in  and one of three values of σ: 0, 0.3, 0.6. B: Variability in the
  elements of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway over time. The effects of extrinsic noise
  in the system were calculated by the coefficient of variation (cv = σS/(μS + 0.1),
  where the subindex s represents the species in the pathway). In the plot the colorbar
  varies between 0 (white color) and larger than 4 (blue color), dark colors represent
  high variability in the dynamics of the studied species. Species were ordered based
  on the average coefficient of variation over all time points for systems with an
  extrinsic noise of σ = 0.3. The overall system dynamics under the influence of extrinsic
  noise can also be observed in Figs J to L in . C: Stochastic simulations of different
  time points after IFN stimulation using a distribution of values as initial conditions.
  The results show a transient perturbation in the MxA and IFIT1 expression when extrinsic
  fluctuations are considered. As reference, experimental data for a system without
  extrinsic noise (σ = 0.0) are given (gray histograms). D: Distributions at multiple
  time points considering different strengths of extrinsic noise vs a system with
  only intrinsic noise are compared using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance.'
