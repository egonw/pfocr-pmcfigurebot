caption: The metabolome view map of the 3 biofluids. (A to C) Metabolic pathway mapping
  significantly differs in rumen fluid (n = 8/group), serum (n = 8/group) and urine
  (MTP, n = 4; HTP, n = 8) metabolites under moderate temperature period and high
  temperature period conditions. The pathway impact analysis was performed using Metaboanalyst
  5.0 program. The x-axis and y-axis represent pathway impact value and −log 10 P-value,
  respectively. The results are presented graphically as a bubble plot. The darker
  color and larger size represent higher P-value from enrichment analysis and greater
  impact from pathway topology analysis, respectively.
