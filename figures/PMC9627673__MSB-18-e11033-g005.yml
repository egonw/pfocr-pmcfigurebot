figure_title: Sensitivity to genetic and pharmacological inhibition between metabolic
  types
caption: 'Schematic representation of pathways depicting analyzed reactions. Gene
  effect (CERES score (Meyers et al, )) estimate gene‐dependency levels from CRISPR‐Cas9
  knock‐out screens on cell line''s growth and is scale so that the median score of
  common essentials genes is −1.Gene effect of PGM3, phosphoglucomutase 3, from the
  amino sugar pathway PGAM1, phosphoglycerate mutase 1, from glycolysis SDHAF4, succinate
  dehydrogenase assembly factor 4 mitochondrial, and IDH2, isocitrate dehydrogenase
  2 mitochondrial, both from the TCA cycle (cell lines n = 63, two‐sided unpaired
  student t‐test).Top dependent metabolic pathways in type 1 (blue) or type 2 (red),
  where normalized enrichment scores are computed using GSEA.Growth response to drug
  MK‐8245, which targets SCD, stearoyl‐CoA desaturase, from the unsaturated fatty
  acids biosynthesis pathway. Data information: Boxplot depicts first quartile, median
  and third quartile, two‐sided unpaired student t‐test. ns: P > 0.05, *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.'
