caption: Linalool biosynthetic pathway genes CsγTRPS (A) and CsLINS (B) are expressed
  in the leaves of control (untreated) and MeJA-treated coriander plants, respectively.
  The Ct values formed the basis of qRT-PCR. The reference gene actin was used to
  standardize the Ct value for each sample. According to Duncan’s test, bars with
  different letters are substantially (p ≤ 0.01) different. Standard error values
  are shown by error bars.
