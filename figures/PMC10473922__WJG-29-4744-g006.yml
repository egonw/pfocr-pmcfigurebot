caption: 'Huangqin decoction improves lipotoxicity, inflammation, and insulin resistance
  in palmitic acid-induced HepG2 cells. Data are presented as mean ± SD of at least
  three independent experiments. aP < 0.01 vs the control group, bP < 0.05 and cP
  < 0.01 vs the palmitic acid (PA) group. A: Viability of HepG2 cells following incubation
  with different concentrations of Huangqin decoction (HQD); B: Viability of HepG2
  cells following co-culture with PA and different concentrations of HQD; C and D:
  Levels of triacylglycerol and total cholesterol in HepG2 cells; E: Representative
  micrographs of Oil Red O staining of HepG2 cells; F–H: Levels of interleukin (IL)-6,
  IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α in HepG2 cells; I: Level of glucose uptake in
  HepG2 cells. 2DG: 2-deoxydglucose; HQD, Huangqin decoction; IL: Interleukin; TC:
  Total cholesterol; TG: Triacylglycerol; TNF: Tumor necrosis factor; PA: Palmitic
  acid.'
