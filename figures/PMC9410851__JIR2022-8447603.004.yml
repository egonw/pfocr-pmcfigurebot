caption: 'The effect of aerosol inhalation of HKCB on the NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome
  signaling pathway in the lung tissues of allergic mice. (a) Expression levels of
  NF-κB p65 and NLRP3 in lung tissues, as examined by immunohistochemistry staining
  (magnification 200x). (b, c) Expression scores of NF-κB p65 and NLRP3 in lung tissues.
  (d) Expression levels of NF-κB p65, NLRP3, ASC, pro-caspase1, caspase1 p20, and
  mature-IL-1β in lung tissues were examined using western blotting. (e–j) Relative
  expression levels of NF-κB p65, NLRP3, ASC, pro-caspase1, caspase1 p20, and mature-IL-1β
  in lung tissues. ∗∗P < 0.01 and ∗∗∗P < 0.001 versus the NC group; #P < 0.05, ##P
  < 0.01, and ###P < 0.001 versus the OVA group. a.i.: aerosol inhalation; CB: Clostridium
  butyricum; HKCB: heat-killed CB.'
