caption: Excess GPx1 and dysfunction and disease. Although, GPx1 protects against
  dysfunction and disease in many biological systems, in some systems the effect of
  excess GPx1 is not beneficial. The effects of GPx1 are dependent on many factors
  including cellular redox state, signaling pathway, and biological or disease model.
  In some cases, excess GPx1 can eliminate essential ROS or create reductive stress
  to augment pathological effects.
