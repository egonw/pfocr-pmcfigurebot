caption: The cytotoxic effect of SANG in TNF-α-activated triple-negative breast cancer
  (TNBC) cells. MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell models were co-treated with 50 ng/mL
  TNF-α and SANG (0–5 µM) for 24 h. On the x-axis, the pointing arrows correspond
  to the designated concentrations to be applied for the following angiogenesis arrays.
  Each data point represents the mean ± SEM of three independent studies/n = 6 each.
  The percentages of cell survival were normalized to the DMSO-treated control cells,
  and IC50 s values were calculated using Prism software. One-way ANOVA followed by
  Bonferroni, a multiple comparison test, were employed to verify the statistical
  difference between the control and co-treated groups. **** p < 0.0001 is highly
  significant; NS is non-significant.
