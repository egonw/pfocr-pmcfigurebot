caption: 'Alterations in cell apoptosis and the expression of major proteins in the
  mitochondrial apoptosis signaling pathway in the quadriceps femoris muscle of rats
  after acute exercise in clean air or ozone-polluted air (n ​= ​5). A: Results of
  TUNEL staining of quadriceps femoris muscle, scale bar ​= ​50 ​μm. The yellow arrow
  represents normal nuclei stained with DAPI, the red arrow represents apoptotic cells
  stained with TUNEL; B: The apoptosis rate of apoptotic positive cells counted by
  IPP6.0 software (Mean ​± ​SD); C: Western blot results of Bcl-2, Bax, Caspase-3,
  Caspase-9, Cyt-C protein expression in the quadriceps femoral muscle of rats; D-G:
  Caspase-3, Caspase-9, Bcl-2/Bax, Cyt-C protein expression histograms (Mean ​± ​SD).
  Air: group of doing different speeds of exercise in clean air; O3: group of doing
  different speeds of exercise in ozone-polluted air. ∗p ​< ​0.05, ∗∗p ​< ​0.01 vs
  Air+0 group, Δp < 0.05, ΔΔp < 0.01 vs O3+0 Group, ##p ​< ​0.01 vs the Air group
  with the same speed, &p ​< ​0.05, &&p ​< ​0.01 vs 10 ​m/min group in the same group,
  $p ​< ​0.05 vs 15 ​m/min group in the same group. TUNEL: Terminal deoxynucleotidyl
  transferase dUTP Nick-End Labeling, DAPI: 4,6-diamino-2-phenyl indole, Bcl-2: B-cell
  lymphoma-2, Bax: Bcl-2 associated X protein, Cyt-C: Cytochrome C, m/min: meter/minute.'
