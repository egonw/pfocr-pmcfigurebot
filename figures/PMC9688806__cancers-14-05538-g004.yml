caption: Knockdown of UCHL5 results in inactivation of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway
  and contributes to decreased c-Myc, SLC25A19, and ICAM5 expression. (A) KEGG pathway
  enrichment analysis was used to assess RNA-Seq data containing shControl and shUCHL5
  bladder cancer cells. (B,C) GSEA identified enrichment of AKT/mTOR signaling pathway
  and c-Myc gene sets. (D) Heat map of the differential expressed genes. (E) The difference
  in AKT/mTOR signaling pathway scores was defined using ssGSEA between the UCHL5
  high- and UCHL5 low-expression groups. (F) The association of UCHL5 expression and
  AKT/mTOR signaling pathway score. (G) qRT-PCR determination of the mRNA levels of
  c-Myc, SLC25A19, and ICAM5 in bladder cancer cells transfected with shControl or
  shUCHL5. (H–K) Protein levels of the AKT/mTOR signal pathway proteins (t-PI3K, p-PI3K,
  t-AKT, p-AKT, t-mTOR, and p-mTOR), c-Myc, SLC25A19, and ICAM5 in UCHL5 silenced
  and overexpressed bladder cancer cells shown by Western blotting. β-Actin is used
  as the loading control. Values are shown as mean ± SD. * p < 0.05 and **** p < 0.0001
  compared with controls.
