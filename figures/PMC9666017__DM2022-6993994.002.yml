caption: 'Overexpression of Pygo1 induced G1/S phase transformation of A549 cells
  and inhibited apoptosis. (a, b) Pygo1 protein was overexpressed in A549 cell lines
  and its fold change. EV: blank control; Tag2B: negative control; Pygo1: Pygo1 overexpression
  cells; GAPDH: loading control (n = 3). (c) Quantitative analysis of cell cycle stage
  by flow cytometry. (d) Quantitative analysis of cell proliferation detected by CCK-8.
  (e) Quantitative analysis of apoptosis by flow cytometry. (f, g) Cleaved-caspase-3
  protein level detected by western blotting and its fold change. (h, i) Cell cycle-related
  proteins detected by western blotting and their fold change by ImageJ and GraphPad
  Prism (n = 3). ns p ≥ 0.05, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001.'
