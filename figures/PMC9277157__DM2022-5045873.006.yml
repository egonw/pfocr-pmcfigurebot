caption: miR-29a regulates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by targeting HBP1. (a) Protein
  levels of TCF, LEF, and phosphorylated GSK3β were measured by western blotting.
  (b) The cytoplasmic and nuclear fraction lysates were used to analyze the translocation
  of β-catenin by western blotting. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01.
