figure_title: ALK phosphorylates TOPK at Y74 in vitro
caption: A Screening for upstream kinases of TOPK. P-Tyrosine was detected by western
  blotting analysis. B Active ALK phosphorylated inactive TOPK in vitro in the presence
  of [γ-32p] ATP as visualized by autoradiography. C Synthesized peptides containing
  potential tyrosine sites were used as substrates in an in vitro kinase assay with
  active ALK in the presence of [γ-32P] ATP and the results were visualized by autoradiography.
  D Active ALK phosphorylated inactive TOPK-WT or 74F in vitro in the presence of
  ATP. Then, the samples were analyzed by western blotting. Data are representative
  of results from triplicate experiments.
