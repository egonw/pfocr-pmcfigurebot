caption: Functional enrichment analysis of DEPs in AKAP9 I2558 M group versus AKAP9 WT
  group. (a) Bar graph of the statistically enriched terms in gene ontology and reactome
  pathway across input proteins via the Metascape software. Total 26 DEPs in AKAP9 WT
  and 153 DEPs in AKAP9 I2558 M group were input. (b) Network layout of the enriched
  terms for DEPs of AKAP9 WT and AKAP9 I2558 M group. The size of a node is proportional
  to the number of input genes that fall into that term, and the respective color
  represents its cluster identity. Terms with a Kappa‐statistical similarity score
  >0.3 are linked by an edge (the thickness of the edge represents the similarity
  score). (c) Protein–protein interaction (PPI) network and MCODE components identified
  in the DEPs of AKAP9 I2558 M. MCODE algorithm was applied to PPI network to identify
  neighborhoods where proteins are densely connected. Each MCODE network is assigned
  a unique color. GO enrichment analysis was applied to each MCODE network to assign
  “meanings” to the network component. The red represents protein network involved
  in translation; the blue represents protein network involved in RNA localization;
  the green represents protein network involved in oxidative activity

  modification and interactome of tau and cellular functions in CRISPR‐edited human
  neuronal cells.
