caption: JH signaling pathway.Schematic diagram showing the cellular response upon
  JH stimulation, summarized from the previous literature. JH binds to its intracellular
  receptor Methoprene-tolerant (Met) and the complex is transported into the nucleus,
  mediated by heat shock protein 83 (Hsp83). Steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) then
  forms a heterodimer with the JH-Met to form an active complex to regulate the transcription
  of target genes. A putative transmembrane receptor (labeled in pale green with a
  dotted line) is hypothesized from previous studies, which demonstrated an activated
  intracellular RTK-signaling pathway (phospholipase C (PLC), phosphatidylinositol
  biphosphatein (PIP2), diacylglycerol (DAG), inositol trisphosphate (IP3), and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase II (CaMKII)) in JH-stimulating cells.
