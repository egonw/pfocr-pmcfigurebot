caption: Ionizing radiation induces lysine residue hyperacetylation, thus modifying
  cardiac metabolic enzymes. (a) Radiation induces protein acetylation in mouse hearts
  after 5 months. (b) Radiation induces protein acetylation in H9C2 cells at different
  time points. (c) Experimental flow chart of proteomic analysis. (d) Clusters of
  Orthologous Groups/KOG functional classification chart of proteins corresponding
  to differentially expressed modification sites. (e) GO enrichment bubble plot of
  proteins corresponding to differentially expressed modification sites in the biological
  process category. (f) KEGG pathway enrichment bubble plot of proteins corresponding
  to differentially expressed modification sites. (g) PPI network of the DEPs. Red
  nodes represent upregulated proteins, and blue nodes represent downregulated proteins.
  (h) The CytoHubba of Degree method were used to extract the top 10 hub proteins
  from the PPI network. (i) The CytoHubba of DMNC method was used to extract the top
  10 hub proteins from the PPI network.
