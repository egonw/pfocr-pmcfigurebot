caption: TIPE2 is a direct target gene of miR-21. (A) qRT-PCR and Western blot of
  TIPE2 in RAW264.7 cells with the treatments of genistein and LPS. (B and C) qRT-PCR
  of miR-21 and TIPE2 in mice PBMCs and aortas. n = 10. (D) qRT-PCR and Western blot
  of TIPE2 in RAW264.7 cells transfected with miR-21 mimic or inhibitor. (E) The predicted
  miR-21 binding sites in murine TIPE2 coding region. ‘X’ indicates the mutated site.
  Wild type and miR-21 binding site-mutated TIPE2 coding regions were analyzed with
  dual luciferase reporter assay in RAW264.7 cells transfected with miR-21 mimic.
  Data are shown as mean ± SD of three independent experiments. LPS, lipopolysaccharides;
  GEN, genistein; PBMCs, peripheral blood mononuclear cells; ns, nonsignificant (P > 0.05);
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
