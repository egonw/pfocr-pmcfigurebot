caption: 'PIK3CA as a target of miR‐1261 is the hub gene of many signaling pathways
  in lung adenocarcinoma cells. (a) Schematic diagram of prediction for the downstream
  target genes of miR‐1261 using targetscan and miRBD databases. (b) KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes) analysis of 23 common potential target genes involving PIK3CA‐associated
  16 top signaling pathways. (c) Schematic diagram for the potential binding sites
  of miR‐1261 in PIK3CA mRNA were predicted by targetscan and miRBD databases. (d)
  The relative luciferase activity of PIK3CA 3′‐UTR‐wild‐type (WT PIK3CA) or ‐mutant
  (MUT PIK3CA) luciferase vector after transfection with miR‐1261 mimics or negative
  control (NC) was detected in H1299 cells. All data represent mean ± SD (n = 3).
  *p < 0.05 versus WT PIK3CA. (e) qRT‐PCR assay for PIK3CA mRNA level in lung adenocarcinoma
  (LUAD) tumors and their adjacent normal tissues (n = 20). *p < 0.05 versus control.
  (f) Kaplan–Meier plotter database (http://kmplot.com/analysis/) was used to further
  validate the poor survival with high expression of PIK3CA in LUAD patients. (g)
  Human protein atlas database (http://www.proteinatlas. org/) was performed to validate
  the stronger positive staining of PIK3CA in cancer tissues than normal lung tissues.
  (h) Representative immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for PIK3CA in lung adenocarcinoma
  (LUAD) tumors and their adjacent normal tissues (n = 20). Down: Statistic analysis
  of PIK3CA‐positive cells. *p < 0.05 versus control'
