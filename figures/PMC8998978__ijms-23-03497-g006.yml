caption: Compound 4o interacts with SHP2 protein and suppresses RAS/MAPK signaling
  pathway in HCT116 cells. (A) Effect of 4o on SHP2 protein stabilization. HCT116
  cells were treated with 10 μM 4o for 3 h before heated at different temperatures.
  Protein levels were analyzed by Western blotting. (B) Protein band densities were
  quantified by normalizing to tubulin. (C) Effects of 4o on the expressions of Ras-GTP
  and p-Erk in HCT116 cells. Cells were treated with 4o (2.5, 5 and 10 μM) for 12
  h. Protein levels were analyzed by Western blotting. (D) Protein band densities
  were quantified by normalizing to RAS or Erk, respectively. Data are presented as
  means ± SD (n = 3). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 versus DMSO.
