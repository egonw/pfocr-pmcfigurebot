caption: 'Representation of Interleukin (IL)-15 transpresentation in keratinocytes
  induced by oxidative stress (OS) and the interaction of interferon gamma (IFNγ)
  with the Janus kinase/signal transducers and transcription activators (JAK/STAT)
  pathway. The OS promotes the transpresentation of I-15 in keratinocytes through
  the binding of IL-15 to the heterodimeric IL-15 receptor (IL15R) on memory CD8 + T
  lymphocytes, consisting of CD122 and CD132, and to the I-15α receptor (IL15Rα) on
  keratinocytes (CD215). This process potentiates the activation of memory CD8 + T
  Cells and the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as IFNy, via JAK/STAT signaling
  (JAK1-STAT3 and JAK3-STAT5). The IFNγ/STAT1/CXCL10 axis conducts the autoimmune
  destruction of melanocytes. IFNγ signals through the IFNγ receptor (IFNγR) to stimulate
  JAK1/JAK2 and activate STAT1. The activation induces the production of CXCL9 and
  CXCL10, which signals through the CXCR3 receptor for the recruitment of more autoreactive
  CD8+ T cells – Source: the authors.'
