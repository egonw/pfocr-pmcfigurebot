caption: Pathway analysis of differentially expressed ad-sEV miRNA (AD vs. control).
  (A). Graphical summary of IPA analysis illustrating the predicted effects of differentially
  expressed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ad-sEV miRNAs. The analysis indicates downregulation
  of long-term potentiation and long-term synaptic depression, showing potential modulation
  of synaptic plasticity. Additionally, the downregulation of Cyclic AMP response
  element binding protein (CREB) 1 was observed. (B). Graphical summary of the predicted
  effects of differentially expressed serum ad-sEV miRNAs. This analysis showed downregulation
  of central nervous system development, cell maturation, neurite outgrowth, and long-term
  synaptic depression in neurons. (C). Diseases and functions annotations predicted
  by differentially expressed miRNA isolated from ad-sEVs in the CSF and serum. A
  positive z-score indicates predicted activation, and a negative z-score indicates
  predicted downregulation. (D). Pathway analysis revealed that the CREB signaling
  pathway was predicted to be downregulated by the microRNA in ad-sEVs isolated from
  CSF. In CSF ad-sEVs, 343 out of 584 molecules in CREB signaling were targeted by
  the differentially expressed miRNAs in AD patients vs. controls. * Denotes that
  multiple identifiers in the dataset map to a single gene in the global molecular
  network.
