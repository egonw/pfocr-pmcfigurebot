caption: Biosynthetic pathway of crocins from zeaxanthin in Buddleja davidii. Pictures
  of B. davidii and N. glauca petals are shown in the upper right. The recombinant
  enzyme introduced in N. glauca under the control of the CaMV35S promoter is shown
  in red. The yellow background shows the stages of transformation of crocetindial
  into the different crocins present in the petals of B. davidii. The arrows show
  each of the conversion steps catalyzed by the corresponding enzyme in gray. The
  different substitutions for the crocins present in the petals of B. davidii are
  shown in the lower left.
