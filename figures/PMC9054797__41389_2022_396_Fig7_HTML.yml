figure_title: The clinical significance of NSE, NBL1, and ALDH1A1 expression in patients
  with SCLC
caption: In all, 82 cases of SCLC tissues were stained with NSE, NBL1, and ALDH1A1
  in serial paraffin-embedded tissue blocks. Representative microscopy images of paired
  NSE, NBL1, and ALDH1A1 staining are shown at 10X and 20X magnifications, scale bar
  200 μm. A Images on the left represent one case with high NSE staining, low NBL1
  staining, and high ALDH1A1 staining. B Images on the right demonstrate a representative
  case with low NSE expression, high NBL1 expression, and low ALDH1A1 expression.
  Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was performed to determine the role of NSE (C), NBL1
  (D), and ALDH1A1 (E) expression in predicting the overall survival of patients with
  SCLC. Spearman’s correlation coefficient was used to assess the correlation between
  NSE, NBL1, and ALDH1A1. F Positive correlation between NSE and ALDH1A1 expression.
  G Negative correlation between NSE and NBL1 expression. H Negative correlation between
  NBL1 expression and ALDH1A1 expression.
