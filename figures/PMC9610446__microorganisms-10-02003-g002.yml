caption: Intracellular trafficking cycle of Brucella in host cells. After recognizing
  Brucella by different receptors, host cells activate the signaling pathway resulting
  in F-actin polymerization at the binding site with bacteria. Then the BCVs undergo
  fusion with early, late endosome, and finally lysosome. At the last phase of BCVsâ€™
  maturation, Brucella is killed by nitric oxide, ROS, and digestive enzymes that
  localize in the phagolysosome compartment. However, Brucella has the ability to
  avoid the phagolysosome fusion to reach its intracellular niche at ER. Brucella
  SagA protein is secreted to interfere with the interaction between BCVs and lysosomes.
  Once localizing in ER, Brucella can proliferate and mature into aBCVs. This aBCVs
  formation depends on distinct autophagy proteins including ULK1 and Beclin 1, which
  contribute to bacterial egress and the formation of infection foci resulting in
  dissemination to other cells and tissues. Besides, Brucella activates a T4SS-BspL
  effector to delay the formation of aBCVs, and ultimately reach maximum proliferation.
