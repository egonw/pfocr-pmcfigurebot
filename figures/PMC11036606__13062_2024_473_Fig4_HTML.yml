caption: Effects of MOF-Fe Nanoparticles on the Iron Metabolism and Associated Gene
  Expression of BMSCs. (A) Perl’s staining images. A block-like distribution of iron
  ions is evident after one hour of coincubation, transitioning to a uniform intracellular
  dispersion at the 24-hour mark. The scale bar in the upper right corner of the magnified
  image is 125 μm. (B) Ferritin light chain (FTL) gene expression. Compared with the
  control group, the MOF-treated groups exhibited elevated FTL expression. (C) Hepcidin
  gene expression. An increase in hepcidin expression was noted in the MOF-treated
  groups compared to the control group. (D) Transferrin receptor (TfR) gene expression.
  MOF treatment of BMSCs significantly reduced TfR expression. (E) Ferroportin (FPN)
  expression. (F) MOF-Fe particles promote osteogenesis by altering iron metabolism,
  reducing the expression of TfR2, and activating the BMP signalling pathway. The
  data are presented as the means ± SDs (n = 3). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01
