figure_title: IL-4 priming followed by LPS activation induces a distinct cytokine
  and chemokine expression profile in murine Macs
caption: '(A) Dots plot visualization of RNA-seq fold changes of LPS-induced cytokines
  and chemokines in IL-4-primed and non-polarized WT BMDMs (n = 3). Colors indicate
  the sign of regulation in IL-4-primed BMDMs (edgeR; FDR < 10%).(B) Experimental
  scheme for the gene expression experiments using various TLR ligands in IL-4-primed
  and non-polarized WT BMDMs.(C) RT-qPCR measurements of the indicated cytokines and
  chemokines from IL-4-primed and non-polarized WT BMDMs following various TLR ligand
  activation (n = 4).(D) Western blot of NF-κB-p65 and IκB expression in IL-4-primed
  and non-polarized WT and Stat6−/− BMDMs. One representative blot is shown from three
  independent experiments. Total protein serves as a loading control.(E) Immunohistochemical
  staining and analysis of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway activation in
  IL-4-primed and non-polarized WT and Stat6−/− BMDMs following LPS stimulation. The
  nuclear localization of the NF-κB-p65 subunit was monitored by immunostaining. Green:
  p65 staining; blue: cell nuclei. Scale bars: 20 μm.(F) The ratio of the fluorescence
  intensity of the NF-κB immunostaining in cell nuclei and cytosol was analyzed (n
  = 3 per genotype).(G) RT-qPCR measurements on the indicated cytokines and chemokines
  from IL-4-primed and non-polarized WT BMDMs following LPS activation in the absence
  and presence of BAY11–708 or Bot64 NF-κB pathway inhibitors (n = 4).WT bone marrow
  cells were isolated from mice with C57BL/6 genetic background. BMDMs were pretreated
  with IL-4 for 24 h (A and C–G) followed by LPS or other TLR ligand exposure for
  1 h (D–F) or 3 h (A, C, and G).Bar graphs present the mean ± SD of the biological
  replicates from two (C and G) or three (F) independent experiments. *p < 0.05, **p
  < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001, ns, not significant change.See .'

  cistromic expansion and extended synergistic response to TLR ligands.
