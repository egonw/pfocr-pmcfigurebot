caption: 'Plasmid-based expression of SMAD3 (p.I67S) displayed decreased TGF-β signaling
  and SMAD3 activity.(A) SMAD3 (p.I67S) was expressed in HEK293 cells and SMAD3 activation
  was examined after TGF-β1 stimulation. (B) SMAD3 activity assessed by luciferase
  reporter assay n = 3, * P < 0.05; Student''s t-test). Error bars: SD of replicates.
  (C) Real-time qPCR for expression of TGF-β signaling target genes in HEK293 cells
  showed reduced TGF-β signaling by the SMAD3 (p.I67S) mutation. n = 3 biological
  replicates, each with two technical replicates; *, P < 0.05; **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.005.'
