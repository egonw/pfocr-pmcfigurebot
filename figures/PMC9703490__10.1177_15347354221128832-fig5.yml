caption: The graphical representation of % of total wound closure in control as well
  as treated samples in all 3 cell types A549 (A), HeLa (B), and U2OS (C). (D) represents
  a bar diagram of in vitro wound healing assay in A549 cells after 24 hours of treatment
  of F6 and F8 at concentrations 0 to 50 µg/ml. Here 0.25% DMSO was used as the negative
  control. % of total wound closure was calculated after 24 hours of treatment. Each
  bar represents the mean with standard deviation from 3 independent experiments.
  Here “**” defines 0.001 < P ≤ 0.01 and “***” defines P ≤ 0.001.
