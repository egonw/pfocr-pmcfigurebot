caption: 'AKIP1 knockdown inhibits the proliferation of ccRCC cells. (A) mRNA (B)
  and protein expression of AKIP1 in Caki-1 cells transfected with siRNA-AKIP1-1 and
  siRNA-AKIP1-2 were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western
  blotting. (C) The viability of Caki-1 cells transfected with siRNA-AKIP1 was analyzed
  by Cell Counting kit-8 assay. (D) The expression of proliferation-related proteins
  in Caki-1 cells transfected with siRNA-AKIP1 was detected by western blotting. (E)
  The proliferation of Caki-1 cells transfected with siRNA-AKIP1 was analyzed by 5-Ethynyl-2''-deoxyuridine
  staining (magnification, x200). **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs. control group; ##P<0.01
  and ###P<0.001 vs. siRNA-NC group. ccRCC, clear cell renal cell carcinoma; AKIP1,
  a-kinase interaction protein 1; siRNA, small interfering RNA; NC, negative control.'
article_title: A-kinase interacting protein 1 regulates the cell proliferation, invasion,
  migration and angiogenesis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma cells and affects
  the ERK/c-Myc signaling pathway by binding to Rac1.
