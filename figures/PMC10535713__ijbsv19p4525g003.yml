caption: 'G6PD is essential for PBX3-induced PPP. A. Intracellular NADPH/NADP+ ratio
  in PBX3-knocked down, G6PD-overexpressed HCT116 cells. B. Intracellular ROS level
  in PBX3-knocked down, G6PD-overexpressed HCT116 cells. Representative images (left)
  and quantification results (right; n = 3) are shown. C-D. Percentage of apoptotic
  cells in PBX3-knocked down, G6PD-overexpressed HCT116 cells, as examined using Annexin
  V/PI staining and flow cytometry. Representative images (C) and quantification results
  (D) are shown. E. Lipid accumulation in PBX3-knocked down, G6PD-overexpressed HCT116
  cells, as examined using Nile red staining. Representative images (left) and quantification
  results (right; n = 6) are shown. F. Proliferation potential of PBX3-knocked down,
  G6PD-overexpressed HCT116 cells, as examined using EdU-incorporation assay. Representative
  images (left) and quantification results (right; n = 6) are shown. G. Viability
  of PBX3-knocked down, G6PD-overexpressed HCT116 cells at indicated time-points.
  H. Colony formation potential of PBX3-knocked down, G6PD-overexpressed HCT116 cells.
  Representative images (left) and quantification results (right; n = 6) are shown.
  I-J. Viabilities of PBX3-knocked down, G6PD-overexpressed HCT116 cells treated with
  indicated doses of oxaliplatin (I) and 5-FU (J). Cells transfected with shCon and/or
  pcCon were used as control. β-actin was used as western blotting loading control.
  Total protein was used for normalizing NADPH/NADP+ level. Scale bars: 200 μm. Quantification
  data are shown as mean ± SD (n = 3; unless otherwise indicated); pcCon: pcEF9-Puro;
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.'
