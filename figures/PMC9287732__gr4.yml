caption: 'Transcriptomic analysis of huPMCs after transketolase (TKT) knockdown and
  light stress. A heatmap of clustered differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Samples
  were from three donors (R03, R04, R09), shown at the bottom of the heatmap. Each
  donor had four groups, “dim control” (DC), “dim knockdown” (DK), “light control”
  (LC), “light knockdown” (LK), shown above. Red indicated a higher expression level,
  while blue indicated a lower expression level. B volcano plot showing DEGs between
  “DK vs DC”. Gene fold changes are represented on the horizontal axis, with statistically
  significant changes on the vertical axis. Individual genes were represented by points
  (grey, not significant; red, significantly upregulated; blue, significantly downregulated).
  C Venn chart comparing “LC vs DC” DEGs and “LK vs DK” DEGs. D and E Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis (IPA) of “LC vs DC” DEGs and “LK vs DK” DEGs. Pathways that were upregulated
  or downregulated were represented on the vertical axis. The Z-score was represented
  on the upper horizontal axis. Red dots indicate the -log (p-value), with bars representing
  activated or inhibited pathways unique to each comparison (grey) or common to both
  (blue). UPS: unfolded protein response; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; CVS: cardiovascular
  system; CCK: cholecystokinin; VitC: vitamin C; PI: phosphoinositide; PL: phospholipase;
  F Prominent NRF2 related DEGs. n = 3 per group. Error bars = SEM. (For interpretation
  of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
  Web version of this article.)'
