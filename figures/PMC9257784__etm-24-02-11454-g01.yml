caption: 'Effect of HIT000218960 expression on 5-FU-induced apoptosis in gastric cancer
  cells in vitro. (A) Flow cytometry was used to detect apoptosis of gastric cancer
  cells following treatment with 50 µmol/l 5-FU. Detection of HIT000218960 expression
  in (B) SNU-5 cells and (C) NCI-N87 cells following overexpression and knockdown,
  respectively. using flow cytometry was used to detect apoptosis of (D) SNU-5 cells
  and (E) NCI-N87 cells following treatment with 50 µmol/l 5-FU. (F) Flow cytometry
  images of (D) and (E) Experiments were repeated in triplicate. ***P<0.001 vs. LV-NC,
  ###P<0.001 vs. Si-HIT000218960. 5-FU, 5-fluorouracil; WT, wild-type; LV, lentivirus;
  si, small interfering; PI, propidium iodide.'
article_title: lncRNA HIT000218960 enhances resistance to 5-fluorouracil by promoting
  HMGA2 and activating the AKT/mTOR/P70S6K pathway in gastric cancer cells.
