caption: 'Effect of Rothia mucilaginosa (Rm) on NF-κB pathway activation by Pseudomonas
  aeruginosa (Pa). a) Activation of the NF-κB pathway measured via luminescence of
  three-dimensional (3D) NF-κB reporter A549 cells. 3D cells were exposed for 4 h
  to P. aeruginosa PAO1 alone or in co-culture with R. mucilaginosa DSM20746. b) Semiquantitative
  determination (by Western blotting) of proteins (i.e. A20, IκBα, p65 and phosphorylated
  (p)-IκBα) produced by 3D A549 cells stimulated with P. aeruginosa PAO1 with or without
  R. mucilaginosa DSM20746 for 15 min (15′), 30 min (30′), 1 h and 4 h. c) Band intensity
  (normalised to β-actin) of Western blot at 4 h of 3D A549 cells stimulated with
  P. aeruginosa PAO1 with or without R. mucilaginosa DSM20746. RLU: relative light
  units; NC: negative control (uninfected 3D NF-κB reporter A549 cells in serum-free
  GTSF-2 medium). Data represent mean±sem, n=3. *: p<0.05; **: p<0.01; ***: p<0.001.'
