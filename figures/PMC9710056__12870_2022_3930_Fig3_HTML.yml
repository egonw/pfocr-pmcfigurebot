caption: a Heatmap of log2FC values of the DEGs enriched in porphyrin and chlorophyll
  metabolism pathway (Ko00860). b Heatmap and pathway map of the DEGs enriched in
  photosynthesis – antenna proteins (Ko00196). c Heatmap and pathway map of the DEGs
  enriched in photosynthesis (Ko00195). The second panels in “b” and “c” show the
  respective KEGG pathway maps with the red boxes representing the enriched DEGs.
  The maps were developed in the KEGG pathway database [] using the KEGG pathway mapper
  [] by searching Ko IDs of the DEGs on respective pathways. Where CK = 0.8% salt
  stressed, B1, B2, B3, and B4 = 0.8% salt-stressed seedlings exogenously sprayed
  with 100 ml of 50 μM, 100 μM, 200 μM, and 500 μM melatonin solution, respectively
article_title: Combined transcriptome and metabolome analysis revealed pathways involved
  in improved salt tolerance of Gossypium hirsutum L. seedlings in response to exogenous
  melatonin application.
