caption: 'Oroxylin A significantly affects transketolase (TKT) protein expression
  and p53 signalling. (A) Western blotting analysis of TKT in Hep1‐6 cells treated
  with 0‐100 μM oroxylin A for 48 h. (B) Western blotting analysis of TKT in HepG2
  and SMMC‐7721 cells treated with oroxylin A for 0‐15 days. Western blotting and
  immunohistochemistry of TKT in (C,E) HepG2 xenograft tumours, and in (D,F) diethylnitrosamine
  (DEN)‐treated mice. Scale bar: 200 μm. Western blotting of proteins involved in
  p53 signalling in (G) HepG2 cells and (H) HepG2 xenograft tumours. (I) Differently
  expressed mRNAs involved in p53 signalling of TKT‐knockdown HepG2 cells using RT‐PCR
  array (n = 3) and evaluated by (J) RT‐PCR analysis. (K) p53 expression and phosphorylation
  levels in HepG2 cells transfected with shNC or shTKT lentivirus treated with 0 or
  50 μM oroxylin A for 48 h. Data are means ± SD; *p < 0.05 vs. the negative control
  (n = 3).'
