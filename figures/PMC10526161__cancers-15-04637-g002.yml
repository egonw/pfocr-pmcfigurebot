caption: Clinicopathological and survival features of breast cancer patients across
  different age groups. (A) Age group and subtype distribution across the METABRIC,
  FUSCC, MSKCC, and SCAN-B cohorts. (B) Distribution of age at diagnosis and the defined
  age groups in the METABRIC cohort. (C) Histological grading, tumor stage, estrogen
  receptor (ER) status, progesterone receptor (PR) status, and human epidermal growth
  factor receptor 2 (HER2) status in each age group. (D) Overall survival (OS) in
  the MTEABRIC cohort. (E) Disease-free survival (DFS) in the METABRIC cohort. Survival
  comparisons were performed, and significant differences were annotated as * p <
  0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; or not significant (ns) (p > 0.05).
