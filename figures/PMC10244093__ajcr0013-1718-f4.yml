caption: 'Linc00662 mediated the malignant progression of PC in a m6A-dependent manner.
  A. Overexpression vectors encoding Linc00662 Wt and Linc00662 Mut (the adenine residues
  of the four m6A motifs A341, A672, A841, and A1725 were replaced by guanine residues)
  were constructed. Stably-overexpressing cell lines were generated and qPCR confirmed
  the overexpression of Linc00662 in PC cells. B. The CCK8 assay showed that the cell
  proliferative capacity was significantly increased in Linc00662 Wt cells, but not
  in Linc00662 Mut cells. C. The colony formation assay showed that the cell proliferative
  capacity was significantly increased in Linc00662 Wt cells, but not in Linc00662
  Mut cells. Representative images were displayed and the bar charts showed the differences
  of clone number among Linc00662 Wt cells, Linc00662 Mut cells, and control cells.
  *: P < 0.05. D. The wound healing assay indicated that the overexpression of Linc00662
  Wt significantly increased cell migratory capacity, but the overexpression of Linc00662
  Mut failed. Representative micrographs were displayed and the bar charts showed
  the differences of migratory area among Linc00662 Wt cells, Linc00662 Mut cells,
  and control cells. *: P < 0.05, magnification: 100 ×. E. The transwell assay revealed
  that the overexpression of Linc00662 Wt significantly increased cell invasive capacity,
  but the overexpression of Linc00662 Mut failed. Representative micrographs were
  displayed and the bar charts showed the differences of invaded cell numbers among
  Linc00662 Wt cells, Linc00662 Mut cells, and control cells. *: P < 0.05, magnification:
  100 ×. F. A mouse xenograft model was used to evaluate the effect of m6A on Linc00662
  on cell proliferation in vivo. Images of transplanted subcutaneous tumors were displayed.
  G. The results showed that the overexpression of Linc00662 Wt in PANC-1 cells increased
  subcutaneous tumor size, but the overexpression of Linc00662 Mut failed. *: P <
  0.05. H. The results showed that the overexpression of Linc00662 Wt in PANC-1 cells
  increased subcutaneous tumor weight, but the overexpression of Linc00662 Mut failed.
  *: P < 0.05. I. The effect of m6A on Linc00662 on tumor metastasis in vivo was evaluated
  in BALB/c nude mice by injecting PC cells through their tail veins. Representative
  images of lung removed from mouse models were displayed. H&E staining was performed
  to confirm the histomorphology of the metastatic lesions Representative micrographs
  were displayed for cancerous lesion in the lungs detected by H&E staining. Scale
  bar: 2000 µm. J. The results showed that the overexpression of Linc00662 Wt in PANC-1
  cells increased the area of lung-metastatic lesions, but the overexpression of Linc00662
  Mut failed. The bar charts showed the differences of area of lung-metastatic lesions
  among Linc00662 Wt, Linc00662 Mut, and control cells. *: P < 0.05. Abbreviations:
