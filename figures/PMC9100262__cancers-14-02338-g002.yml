caption: 'LINC01234 encodes an endogenous peptide highly expressed in CRC. (A) A group
  of three plasmids, pcDNA3.1+, LINC01234ORF-FLAG (pORF-FLAG), and LINC01234ORFmut-FLAG
  (pORFmut-FLAG) (upper panel) was prepared to verify the coding potential of LINC01234ORF,
  and the corresponding antibody for MBOP was validated (lower panel). (B) Based on
  an amino acid mass spectrometry analysis, MBOP was a naturally existing peptide,
  and the part in bold was applied for the generation of an antibody of MBOP (upper
  panel) and a pair of CRC tissues exhibited higher sequence coverage in the cancerous
  one than in the noncancerous one. (C) Expression of MBOP in CRC cell lines and tissues,
  and siRNAs targeting LINC01234 decreased the expression of MBOP. Note: The same
  siRNA-treated HCT116 samples from C were used to detect the expression of MEK1 in
  . (D) The expression of LINC01234ORF and (E) MBOP were mostly localized in the cytoplasm
  of CRC cell lines HCT116 and HCT15. (F) Representative images of immunofluorescence
  of MBOP in lentiviral transfected cell lines co-GFP, ORF-GFP, and ORFm-GFP.'
