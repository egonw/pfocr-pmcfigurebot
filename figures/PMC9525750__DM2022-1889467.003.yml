caption: LINC00514 is targeted and negatively mediated by miR-28-5p. (a) The predicted
  binding sites. (b) Confirmation of the interaction between LINC00514 and miR-28-5p.
  (c) Correlation between LINC00514 and miR-28-5p expression in PA tissues. (d) miR-28-5p
  expression was measured in HP75 and GH3 cells by the RT-qPCR analysis after LINC00514
  silencing. âˆ—p < 0.05.
