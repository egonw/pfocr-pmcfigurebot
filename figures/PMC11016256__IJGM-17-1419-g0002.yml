caption: 'Targets of some miRNAs in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. There are three
  main points in this diagram: (1) PI3K receives signals from tyrosine kinases and
  G protein-coupled receptors. p110 subunits bind to p85 subunits recruited near the
  plasma membrane, converting PIP2 to PIP3. (2) PIP3 binds to Akt and translocates
  it to the cell membrane. (3) Akt is activated by phosphorylation of threonine and
  serine, respectively, with the assistance of PDK1 and PDK2. (4) The targets of action
  of some miRNAs are also labeled in the figure. The miRNAs involved in this signaling
  pathway are all antifibrotic miRNAs.'
