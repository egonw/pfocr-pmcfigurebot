caption: Underlying molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways by which surface electrical
  charges on nanocomposite membranes enhance SHED neural differentiation. (a) Protein
  expression levels of the FAK (PTK2) mechanosensing pathway downstream effectors
  Paxillin and p-Paxillin in SHED cultured on nanocomposite membranes with varying
  surface charges in neural induction medium for 2 days. (b) Protein expression levels
  of Paxillin and p-Paxillin in SHED cultured on nanocomposite membranes with varying
  surface charge in neural induction medium for 8 days. (c) Heat map of up-regulated
  neurogenic promoting genes and down-regulated osteogenic-promoting genes in SHED
  on high-charged nanocomposite membranes after culture in neural induction medium
  for 8 days. (d) Quantitative analysis of protein expression levels of FAK, Paxillin,
  p-Paxillin and p-Paxillin/Paxillin in SHED after culture in neural induction medium
  for 2 days (n = 3). (e) Quantitative analysis of protein expression levels of FAK,
  Paxillin, p-Paxillin and p-Paxillin/Paxillin in SHED after culture in neural induction
  medium for 8 days (n = 3). (f) KEGG signaling pathway analysis of significantly
  differentially-expressed genes in SHED on high-charged nanocomposite membranes after
  culture in neural induction medium for 8 days. (g) The up-regulated gene expression
  of representative mechanosensing and neural differentiation signaling pathways enriched
  by KEGG analysis. (h) qPCR verification of differentially expressed genes related
  to neurogenesis and osteogenesis in the heat map of RNA-Seq analysis in c. (i) qPCR
  verification of differentially expressed genes of representative mechanosensing
  and neural differentiation signaling pathways enriched by KEGG analysis in g. (j)
  Schematic diagram of the possible underlying molecular mechanisms.
