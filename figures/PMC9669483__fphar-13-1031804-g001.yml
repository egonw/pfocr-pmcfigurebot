caption: (A) H&E staining of the human trapezius muscle fibers cross-sections with
  light microscopy (x 400). (a) Control muscle fiber morphology. (b) Enlarged and
  round muscle fibers were observed in MTrPs patients. (B). RNA-seq was used to compare
  the transcriptome differences of MEF2C between healthy human control group (n =
  5) and MTrPs group (n = 7, log2FC = 10.20419, versus control using unpaired Mann-Whitney
  U Test, p < 0.05). (C). Immunofluorescence staining of trapezius muscle fibers in
  human control and MTrPs groups, showed a significant increase in nuclear translocation
  in the MTrPs group. (D). The number of MEF2C expression in the Control and MTrPs
  group. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.
