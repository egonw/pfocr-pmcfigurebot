figure_title: Regulation of V-ATPase activity
caption: A The pH value of various organelles in the cell is different, which is maintained
  by V-ATPase. When the endosome is acidified, the ligand is released, and the receptor
  is recycled back to the cell surface. During intracellular transport, the pH of
  the Golgi apparatus decreases from cis- to trans-Golgi network (TGN). The pH of
  the late endosome is lower than that of TGN, which facilitates the binding of lysosomal
  enzymes to the mannose 6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) of TGN and dissociation in the
  late endosome. B In mammalian cells, the reversible assembly of V-ATPase occurs
  in response to glucose changes, amino acid starvation, exposure to growth factors,
  dendritic cell maturation, and viral infection. C V-ATPase activity is affected
  by its trafficking, which is further controlled by the soluble adenylyl cyclase
  (sAC)-adenosine 3’,5’-monophosphate (cAMP)-PKA pathway.
