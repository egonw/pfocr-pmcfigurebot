figure_title: Silencing HPSE arrests cell cycle of BRAF V600E-mutant CRC cells by
  downregulating Cyclin E2 expression
caption: A Cell cycle distributions and statistical analysis of HT29 and RKO with
  or without HPSE silencing. The same trend was observed in three independent repeated
  experiments. Representative images and statistical analysis of cell cycle distribution
  are shown. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. B Expressions of
  critical cell cycle-related proteins in BRAF V600E-mutant CRC cells with or without
  HPSE silencing. The same trend was observed in three independent repeated experiments.
  Green color represents downregulated proteins. Representative results and semi-quantification
  analysis are shown. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. C IHC staining
  of Cyclin E2 in subcutaneous tumor tissues. Representative results and semi-quantification
  analysis are shown. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. D Verification
  of CCNE2 overexpression in HPSE-knockdown HT29 at the protein level. The same trend
  was observed in three independent repeated experiments. Representative results and
  semi-quantification analysis are shown. Data are presented as the mean ± standard
  deviation. NC negative control. OE overexpression of CCNE2. E Representative images
  and statistical analysis of colony formation assay. Cells were seeded in six-well
  plates at 1000 cells per well and cultured for 10 days. The same trend was observed
  in three independent repeated experiments. Data are presented as the mean ± standard
  deviation. The student’s t-test was used to determine the P-value in two-group comparisons.
  One-way ANOVA analysis and Tukey’s test were used for multiple comparisons. ****P < 0.0001,
  ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05, ns P > 0.05.
