caption: 'TDP-43-mediated transcriptional regulation. Genes for which TDP-43 has been
  shown to regulate the transcription by acting at the promoter level are illustrated
  in their context. (a–e) Transcriptional repression, involving the direct binding
  of TDP-43 to the target DNA regulatory region. (a) TDP-43 binding on Acrv1 promoter
  via two GTGTGT-motifs controls the production of Sp-10 protein during mouse spermatogenesis.
  TDP-43 at Acrv1 promoter is still observed when histones acquire activating modifications
  (H3K9Ac, H3K4me3, increases in RNA-pol II) and transcription starts in spermatids.
  In the liver, TDP-43 binding and inactive chromatin mark H3K9me2 associates with
  Acrv1 inhibition (adapted from []). (b) Repressive potential of TDP-43 on the c-fos
  promoter. Tethering of TDP-43 to a reporter plasmid using Gal4 DNA Binding Domain
  (DBD), fused to TDP-43 at Gal4 binding sequences (blue boxes), upstream of the c-fos
  promoter, represses the promoter-induced luciferase expression (adapted from []).
  (c) In neurons, TDP-43 represses the promoter of VSP4B, ensuring recycling endosome
  transport. The repression occurs via the binding of TDP-43 at a GT-rich region less
  than 1 kb before VPS4B TSS. Loss of TDP-43 derepresses the VPS4B promoter, leading
  to loss of dendrites and dendritic spines (adapted from []). (d) TDP-43 contributes
  to the supplementary X inactivation (Xi) and X-linked genes in females. TDP-43 interacts
  with Xist RNA in female cells together with other Xist RNA binding proteins: PTBP1,
  MATR3, or CELF1. The TDP-43 strongest binding within Xist occurs at the 3′ end of
  the E-repeat containing multiple (GU)n tracts and persists after completion of X
  inactivation. Depletion of TDP-43 induces significant nuclear dispersal of Xist
  and defects in DNA compaction (adapted from []). (e) TDP-43 binds to a short 40
  bp region located from −200 to −160 of Cyp8b1 promoter in liver and represses its
  expression. The decrease in Cyp8b1 results in the activation of FXR and an increase
  in apoC2 levels and diffusion, resulting in enhanced triglyceride (TG) clearance
  in several mice tissues (muscle, heart, and adipose cells). lncLSTR, a liver-specific
  lncRNA, binds TDP-43 protein and impedes its binding onto Cyp8b1 promoter, consequently
  counteracting TG clearance (adapted from []). (f–h) Transcriptional activation.
  (f) TDP-43 binds to and activates the TNF-alpha promoter at an LPS-sensitive binding
  site, located −550 to −487, and mediates the activation of Thd1 macrophage-like.
  siRNA against TDP-43 reduces the LPS induction of TNF-alpha by 50% (adapted from
  []). (g) TDP-43 is a direct transcriptional activator of the CHOP/GADD153 promoter
  in SH-SY5Y, provoking cell death. Binding within the CHOP promoter potentially occurs
  in a region comprised within the bp −300 and −30 from the TSS. TDP-43 also increases
  CHOP mRNA stability. Acetylation of TDP-43 at lysine 145 and 192 impedes TDP-43
  activation of the CHOP promoter (adapted from []). (h) During C2C12 differentiation,
  TDP-43 is tethered by the muscle-enriched lncRNA Myolinc to the promoter of several
  genes linked to the differentiation of myoblasts into myocytes, such as Acta1, MyoD1,
  Filip1, and others (adapted from []). (i) Circplot-like summary of the different
  modalities by which TDP-43 regulates gene expression. TDP-43 can act at “single”
  or “multiple” targets “functionally” (e.g., the myogenesis pathway) or “spatially”
  (chromosome X) related. It can be “repressive” or “activating”, involving lncRNAs
  acting either by “evicting” TDP-43 or tethering it, thus acting as a “scaffold”.
  Generally, direct binding of TDP-43 on its target’s promoter has been demonstrated.
  The dependence for DNA binding on GT-rich sequences (“GT-rich”) or not (“Not GT”),
  when known, is shown, but is has not always been specified (“?”).'
