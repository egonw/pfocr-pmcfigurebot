caption: Clinical response in patients with PBRM1 mutation is associated with innate
  immune signaling and cGAS expression. (A,B) Significantly enriched KEGG gene sets
  (false discovery rate [FDR] q-value < 0.25) by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
  from Checkmate trial data in PBRM1 mutant patients treated with nivolumab with complete
  or partial response (CR/PR) over progressive disease (PD) (A) and from Javelin renal
  101 trial data in PBRM1 mutant patients treated with avelumab plus axitinib with
  the upper 20% PFS over the lower 20% PFS (B). Immune signaling KEGG gene sets are
  marked in red. (C,D) Corresponding gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) plots of
  gene set “KEGG cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway” as an example of the analysis in A
  and B. The false discovery rate (FDR) q-value is indicated. (E,F) Box and whisker
  plots showing gene expression of cGAS (MB21D1) from Checkmate trial data in PBRM1
  WT or mutant patients treated with nivolumab with complete or partial response (CR/PR)
  over progressive disease (PD) (E) and from Javelin renal 101 trial data in PBRM1
  WT or mutant patients treated with avelumab with the upper 20% PFS over the lower
  20% PFS (F). Each data point represents an individual patient. Box plot hinges denote
  the 25th–75th percentiles, central lines denote the median, and whiskers extend
  to the highest and lowest values (Wilcoxon rank sum test).
