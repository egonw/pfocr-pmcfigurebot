caption: Rodr√≠guez-Huerto et al. developed an efficient method to access N-arylmethyl-2-substituted
  benzimidazoles from nitroarenes and aldehydes. The synthesis was performed in a
  tin(ii) chloride dihydrate/choline chloride eutectic mixture to provide products
  in good to excellent yields. A reaction pathway was also described ().
