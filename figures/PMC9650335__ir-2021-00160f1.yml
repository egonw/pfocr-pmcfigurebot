caption: The canonical signaling pathway of cannabinoid receptors (CBRs). Here we
  display a largely simplified example of the main signaling pathways initiated by
  the binding of a cannabinoid agonist to a CBR, either CB1R or CB2R. The canonical
  binding pathway involves the coupling of Gi/0 proteins. The α subunits will display
  different actions, as α0 will lead to inactivation of Ca2+ voltage related channels
  and K+ channels. Activation; αi will lead to inhibition of adenylate cyclase (AC)
  and 3’,5’-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) formation, this will inhibit the
  MEK/ERK/MAPK cascade, resulting in the cellular survival/death decision. In some
  instances, CBRs might couple to Gs proteins and, therefore, αs will stimulate cAMP
  [,,-]. PKA, protein kinase A; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; ERK,
  extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase.
