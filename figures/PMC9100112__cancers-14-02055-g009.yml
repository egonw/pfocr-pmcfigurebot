caption: Schematic representation of autocrine/paracrine IL-6 or the LIF/gp130/STAT3
  pathway in PDAC sphere cells. In PDAC sphere cells in which CSCs are enriched (CSC-like
  cells), binding of autocrine/paracrine IL-6 or LIF to each receptor (IL-6R or LIFR,
  respectively) induces gp130 homodimerization or LIFR/gp130 complex formation to
  thereby activating JAKs followed by phosphorylation of gp130, ultimately leading
  to STAT3 activation. This pathway contributes to the maintenance of stemness features
  and expression of MT1-MMP and TGFβ-RII. Expression of TGFβ-RII via the gp130/STAT3
  pathway affects TGF-β1/Smad signaling to promote EMT induction. Additionally, p-STAT3
  can access the active promoter region of H19 and contribute to its transcription.
  Therefore, autocrine/paracrine IL-6 or the LIF/gp130/STAT3 pathway in PDAC CSC-like
  cells is believed to eventually lead to invasion and metastasis, both of which are
  hallmarks of malignancy.
