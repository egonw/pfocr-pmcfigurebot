caption: The expression levels of TGF-β1 (a), TβRI (b), TβRII (c), p-Smad2 (d), p-Smad3
  (e), and Smad7 (f) protein and their protein band ((g), (h)) in the lung tissue
  of mice in each group. NC, normal control group; BLM, bleomycin-induced systemic
  sclerosis model group; PESV-L, low-dose PESV intervention group; PESV-M, medium-dose
  PESV intervention group; PESV-H, high-dose PESV intervention group; DXM, dexamethasone
  intervention group. Compared with the NC group, ▲P < 0.05, ▲▲P < 0.01; compared
  with the BLM group, ★P < 0.05, ★★P < 0.01. Data represent the mean ± SEM, n = 6.
