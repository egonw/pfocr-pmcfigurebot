caption: BCKDK overexpression is associated with advanced pathological grade in OC
  patients. (a) Expression of BCKDK in 6 different ovarian cell lines. (b) Immunohistochemical
  examination for the expression of BCKDK in 70 cases of human ovarian cancer tissues
  and 30 of adjacent tissues. Pictures from 1 representative case are shown in the
  upper panel, and the 2 scale bars from up to down in each group correspond to 100
  and 40 μm, respectively. (c) Statistics of the IHC examination results are shown.
  The IHC score of BCKDK is higher in OC tissues than adjacent tissues. (d) The correlation
  between BCKDK expression and clinicopathologic features and correlation data were
  determined by using Pearson's correlation coefficients. Error bars represent the
  mean ± SD values (∗∗∗P < 0.001).
