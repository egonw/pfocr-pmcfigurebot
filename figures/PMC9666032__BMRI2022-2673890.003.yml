caption: Gene Ontology enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses of DE-mRNAs. (a) Mainly
  enriched GO terms of DE-mRNAs. The GO terms were classified into three categories,
  including biological process (BP), cellular components (CC), and molecular function
  (MF). The lengths of the columns indicate the -log10(P) of input DE-mRNAs in GO
  terms. The number following the columns indicates the quantities of input DE-mRNAs
  in each GO term. The ratios of blue/red columns indicate the relative quantities
  of decreased DE-mRNAs vs. increased DE-mRNAs in each GO term. (b) The top 15 significantly
  enriched KEGG pathways. The lengths of the columns indicate the -log10(P) of input
  DE-mRNAs in KEGG pathways. The number following the columns indicates the quantities
  of input DE-mRNAs in each KEGG pathway. The ratios of blue/red columns indicate
  the relative quantities of decreased DE-mRNAs vs. increased DE-mRNAs in each pathway.
