caption: Schematic model for the action mechanism of lithium. Once internalized, lithium
  results in the activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, promoting AMPK
  activation. Both AMPK and the Wnt pathway activation can trigger the upregulation
  of neuronal Glut3, resulting in glucose metabolism restoration by the stimulation
  of glucose uptake, increased glycolysis, and elevated ATP levels. Dashed lines indicate
  the participation of several proteins.
