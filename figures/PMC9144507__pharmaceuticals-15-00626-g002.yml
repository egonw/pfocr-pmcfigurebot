caption: 'Molecular effects of metformin in cancer cells. Metformin directly inhibits
  complex I of the electron transport chain in the mitochondria resulting in decreased
  ATP/AMP ratio and activation of AMPK. AMPK activation inhibits mTOR and activates
  P53 to impact subsequent cellular processes. Metformin also inhibits mTOR in an
  AMPK-independent manner, through Rag GTPases and REDD1. Reduced insulin availability
  through metforminâ€™s systemic effects indirectly modulates the proliferative pathway,
  PI3K/AKT. AMP: Adenosine Monophosphate; AMPK: AMP-Activated Protein Kinase; ATP:
  Adenosine Triphosphate; IGF: Insulin-like Growth Factors; IGF-R: Insulin-like Growth
  Factor Receptor; mTOR: Mammalian Target of Rapamycin; OTC: Organic Cation Transporter;
  PI3K: Phosphoinositide 3-kinase; REDD1: Regulated in Development and DNA damage
  responses 1; SLC: Solute Carrier Transporter; TSC2: Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2.
