caption: 'Effects of POP on the expression of p38, i-NOS, and COX-2 in ipsilateral
  rat brains after MCAO/R. (A) Representative Western blot images of proteins from
  ipsilateral brains 24 h after MCAO/R. Quantification of the relative ratio of (B)
  p-p38/p-38, (C) i-NOS/β-actin, and (D) COX-2/β-actin versus the sham control. Values
  are expressed as the mean ± SEM. ## p < 0.01 versus sham; ** p < 0.01 versus the
  vehicle-treated group (Tukey’s test). p38, signaling transduction pathway; p-p38,
  phospho-p38; i-NOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2.'
