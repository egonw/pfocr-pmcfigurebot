caption: Effects of SIN on HepG2/C3A tumor growth and angiogenesis in BALB/c nude
  mice. (A) Chemical structure of SIN. (B) Representative images of HepG2/C3A cell-derived
  tumors obtained on the last day of the animal experiment. (C) Growth curve of HepG2/C3A
  cell-derived tumors. n=5, *P<0.05 vs. the control group. (D) Body weight change
  of the different groups. n=5. (E) Representative images of IHC staining (magnification,
  x200) in tumor samples on day 14 and statistical analysis of CD31 staining results.
  n=3, *P<0.05 vs. the control group. (F and G) Western blotting and relative gray
  value analyses of CD31 and VEGF protein expressions in tumor tissues. n=3, **P<0.01.
  SIN, sinensetin; IHC, immunohistochemical; CD31, platelet/endothelial cell adhesion
  molecule-1; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; AOD, average optical density.
