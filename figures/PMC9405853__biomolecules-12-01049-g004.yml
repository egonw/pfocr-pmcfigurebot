caption: Selenophosphate synthetase 1 gene module. (a) 2D map of the genome-wide co-essentiality
  network showing the cluster in red. The expanded view shows the tight clustering
  of the 15 proteins (shown in red) in the cluster. (b) Pathway enrichment analysis
  for the proteins in the cluster, which are listed on the right. (c) Correlation
  heatmap of cell viability scores between the 15 proteins in the cluster. The values
  correspond to Pearsonâ€™s correlation across 941 cancer cell lines from the Cancer
  Dependency Map [].
