caption: Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) effects on the expression of miRNAs in the
  mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) of mouse offspring. MicroRNA expression profiles in
  the MBH of ad libitum-fed (AD) and alcohol-fed (AF) mice at PD-6 were measured by
  TaqMan miRNA TILDA array. Differentially expressed miRNAs were determined using
  the criteria of two-fold change in expression with p < 0.05. a Heat map of all differentially
  expressed miRNAs in AD and AF mouse hypothalamus. b Volcano plot represents all
  significantly upregulated miRNAs in AF (red circles) which met the criteria. Data
  are mean of n = 3. Significance at p < 0.05. c The pathway analysis of miRNAs upregulated
  in PAE mouse MBH. PAE-induced upregulated miRNAs were analyzed to determine their
  target genes involved in disease-signaling pathway using IPA software. Disease pathway
  versus number of genes (blue)/miRNAs (red) involved in the pathway were plotted
  to show PAE-altered miRNAs involved in various diseases. d MicroRNA target prediction
  in Pomc 3′UTR. Pomc gene with 5′UTR and 3′UTR is represented. The putative miRNA
  binding sites of Pomc 3′UTR were also represented by thick vertical lines at 3′UTR
  region. The position of each miRNA binding site of Pomc 3′UTR, and sequence pairing
  of target region and miRNA seed match were shown in the figure.
