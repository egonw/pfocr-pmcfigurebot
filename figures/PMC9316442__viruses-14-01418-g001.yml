caption: 'ZIKV and DENV induced transcriptional changes in hNPCs. (A) Schematic of
  the RNA-seq and ribosome footprinting on hNPCs cells infected with ZIKV or DENV
  (72 h). Comparison of ribosome-protected sequences vs. total mRNA isolates the translational
  efficiency for each mRNA (TE). (B,C), RNA-Seq analysis identifies changes in transcription
  in hNPCs cells infected with ZIKV (B) and DENV (C) compared to uninfected samples.
  Using the statistical cut-off of 5% FDR (False Discovery Rate), we identify differential
  mRNAs with significantly decreased or increased (shown in red; q < 0.05) or unchanged
  transcription (background, shown in black); two biological replicates. (D,E), Venn
  diagram showing the number of shared or exclusive RNAs that are significantly downregulated
  (D) or upregulated (E) (q < 0.05) in ZIKV and DENV infected hNPCs (F,G), STRING:
  Functional Protein Association Networks (version 11.0) analysis of downregulated
  RNAs (n = 335; q < 0.05) in ZIKV-infected hNPCs shows (F) three enriched clusters
  I, II, and III related to histone genes (green), SLE, viral carcinogenesis, alcoholism
  (blue), and cell cycle (red), respectively. (G) Cluster III showed sub-clusters
  related to the cell cycle mitotic (green) and resolution of sister chromatid pathways
  (blue). (H), Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for chromosomal positional sets
  showed significant enrichment of genes clustered on chr6p22, chr1q21, and chr1p31
  among the downregulated RNA (n = 335; q < 0.05) in ZIKV infected hNPCs. (I), GSEA
  for KEGG pathway enrichment in the subset of mRNA downregulated upon ZIKV infection.
  (J), GSEA of transcription factor motif enrichment in the subset of mRNAs downregulated
  in ZIKV infected samples. (K,L), GSEA for KEGG pathways show significant enrichment
  of mTOR (red) (K), histone (blue) genes (K), and MYC/E2F targets (L) in downregulated
  mRNA (n = 37; q < 0.05) in DENV infected hNPCs.'
