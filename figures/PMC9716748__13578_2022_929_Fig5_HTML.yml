caption: Cx43 HCs and pannexin1 channels regulate intracellular Ca2+signaling activated
  by Piezo1. A and B Ca2+ signals and AUC of MLO-Y4 cells pre-incubated with Cx43(E2),
  followed with Yoda1 treatment. n = 8 and 6 for control and Cx43(E2) group, respectively.
  C and D Ca2+ signals and AUC of Rosa26 and Cx43 KD MLO-Y4 cell, n = 3. E EtBr dye
  uptake on MLO-Y4 cells pre-incubated with Cx43(E2), 10Panx, and Cx43(E2) plus 10Panx
  with Yoda1 treatment. n = 6; F Representative Ca2+ images of Cx43(E2), 10Panx, or
  Cx43(E2) plus 10Panx pre-incubated groups at 0 (application Yoda1), 180, and 360 s,
  (F) are representative images from three independent experiments. G and H Ca2+ signals
  and AUC of MLO-Y4 cells pre-incubated with Cx43(E2), 10Panx, and Cx43(E2) plus 10Panx,
  followed with Yoda1 treatment, n = 8, 6, 3, and 3 for control, Cx43(E2), 10Panx,
  and Cx43(E2) plus 10Panx group, respectively; I and J Ca2+ signals of MLO-Y4 cells
  pre-incubated with Cx43(E2) antibody or 10Panx with additional 10Panx or Cx43(E2)
  antibody treatment 120 s after Yoda1 application, respectively, during live imaging,
  n = 8, 3, 3 for control, and two sequential groups, respectively; Data are shown
  as mean ± SEM, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ****p < 0.0001. Student-Newman Keul’s test
  for panels B and D, and One-way ANOVA for panels E, H, and J
