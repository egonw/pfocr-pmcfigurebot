caption: miR-140-3p targets HMGB1 through JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway and inhibits
  the pathogenesis of asthma. A. qRT-PCR and B. Western blot were used to detect HMGB1
  mRNA and protein expression in ASMCs stimulated with 20 ng/mL PDGF-BB after transfection
  with miR-140-3p mimics, HMGB1 overexpression plasmid or miR-140-3p mimics +HMGB1
  overexpression. C. CCK-8 assay, D. BrdU assay, E. Transwell assay were used to detect
  the proliferation and migration of ASMCs stimulated by 20 ng/mL PDGF-BB after transfection.
  F. ELISA was used to detect the contents of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in the supernatant
  of ASMCs stimulated with 20 ng/mL PDGF-BB after transfection. G. Western blot assay
  was used to detect the protein expression of p-JAK2, p-STAT3, JAK2, and STAT3 in
  ASMCs stimulated by 20 ng/mL PDGF-BB after transfection. Data are expressed as mean
  ± standard deviation (n=3). *; P<0.05, **; P<0.01, ***; P<0.001, HMGB1; High mobility
