caption: The functional characteristics and signaling pathways enriched with proteasome
  genes and their interacted genes. A The co-expression network of proteasome genes.
  Blue dots represent positive correlation, and red dots represent negative correlation.
  B Protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks based on proteasome genes and proteasome-interacted
  genes (combined score > 0.9). C The heat map of proteasome-related pathway alterations
  between tumor and control tissues across 21 cancer types. Red represents activated
  pathways, and green represents inhibited pathways. D The volcano plot presented
  the activation and inhibition of signaling pathways. Red represents activated pathways,
  and green represents inhibited pathways. E BP analysis of proteasome genes and proteasome-integrated
  genes. F CC analysis of proteasome genes and proteasome-interacted genes. G MF analysis
  of proteasome genes and proteasome-interacted genes. BP, biological process. CC,
  cellular component. MF, molecular function
