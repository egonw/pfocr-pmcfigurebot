caption: The relative miR-221 and AEG-1 mRNA levels in HCC cell lines. The miR-221
  (A) and AEG-1 (B) relative mRNA levels analyzed in HCC cell line panels, the relative
  miR-221 expression in miR-221 mimic- (C), miR-221 inhibitor- (D), and AEG-1 siRNA-
  (E) transfected HCC cells. The relative mRNA levels of AEG-1 in miR-221 mimic/inhibitor-
  (F) and AEG-1 siRNA-transfected groups in HCC cells (G). The RNU6 and GAPDH were
  used as internal controls. Error bars presented as mean Â± s.d and p-values represented
  as *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001. ns represented as non-significance.
