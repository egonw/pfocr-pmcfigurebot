caption: BRU inhibited the migration and invasion of HCT-116 and SW480 cells. Wound
  healing experiments were performed to detect representative images (a, c) and statistical
  analysis of cell mobility (b, d) of HCT-116 and SW480 cells treated with different
  concentrations of BRU for 24 h. Representative images (e, g) of the invasion results
  of HCT-116 and SW480 cells treated with BRU at different concentrations were detected
  by transwell assay. Statistical plots of invaded cells (f, h). All data were shown
  as mean ± SD from three independent trials (∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. control).
