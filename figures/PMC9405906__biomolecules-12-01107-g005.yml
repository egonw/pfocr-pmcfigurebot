caption: 'Epi-isozizaene allylic oxidation by CYP170A1 supported by 0305φ8-36 flavodoxin.
  (A) Metabolic pathway for the formation of albaflavenone catalysed by CYP170A1.
  (B) In vitro catalytic activity of CYP170A1 supported by 0305φ8-36 and E. coli flavodoxin
  reductase. Product profile was obtained using individual component concentrations
  as follows: 1 nmol CYP170A1, 10 nmol 0305φ8-36 flavodoxin or 10 nmol E. coli flavodoxin,
  2.0 nmol E. coli flavodoxin reductase and 40 nmol epi-isozizaene. Three products
  are noted, 2 and 3 (4(R)-albaflavenol and 4(S)-albaflavenol epimers respectively)
  and 4 (albaflavenone), respectively; substrate epi-isozizaene as 1. Experiments
  were performed in triplicate. In negative control incubations (without CYP170A1
  or without flavodoxin/flavodoxin reductase), no product formation was observed (data
  not shown).'
