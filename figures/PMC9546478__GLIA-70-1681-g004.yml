caption: Transcriptomic analysis of Olig2‐initiated tumors with PDGF‐A overexpression.
  (a) Otv‐a‐Cre;p53fl/fl mice were injected with RCAS‐PDGF‐A and RCAS‐H3.3K27M or
  RCAS‐H3.3WT. Volcano plot comparing gene expression in H3.3K27M and H3.3WT tumors.
  There were a total of 907 significantly differentially expressed genes including
  320 upregulated and 587 downregulated genes in the H3.3K27M group compared with
  the controls. N = 5. (b) Principal component analysis comparing Otv‐a‐Cre;p53fl/fl;PDGF‐A;H3.3K27M
  and Otv‐a‐Cre;p53fl/fl;PDGF‐A;H3.3WT tumors showing partial overlap. (c) Unsupervised
  hierarchical clustering of differentially regulated genes (p adj  <.05) between
  H3.3K27M and H3.3WT tumors (n = 5 each). (d) Gene ontology pathway analysis of upregulated
  and downregulated genes. (e–g) GSEA plots for interferon alpha response (e), interferon
  gamma response (f), and H3K27me3 promoters (g) (Mikkelsen et al., ) in H3.3K27M
  tumors relative to H3.3WT. NES, normalized enrichment score
