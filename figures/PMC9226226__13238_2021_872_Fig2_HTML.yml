caption: GA alleviates senescence and enhances self-renewal ability in HGPS, RS and
  stress-induced senescent WT hMSCs. (A) Schematic outlining generation of HGPS hMSC.
  (B) Immunostaining of Ki67 in vehicle- and GA-treated HGPS hMSCs (passage 9), Scale
  bar, 20 μm. Data are shown as means ± SEM of ≥100 cells from three biological replicates.
  ***P < 0.001 (t-test). (C) Representative western blot images of P16 and LAP2β proteins
  in vehicle- and GA-treated HGPS hMSCs (passage 9). (D) Immunostaining of γ-H2AX
  and 53BP1 in vehicle- and GA-treated HGPS hMSCs (passage 9), Scale bar, 20 μm. White
  dashed lines represent the nuclear boundaries of cells. Data are shown as means
  ± SEM of ≥100 cells from three biological replicates. **P < 0.01 (t-test). (E) Schematic
  showing generation of replicative-senescent (RS) wild type (WT) hMSCs. (F) Immunostaining
  of Ki67 in vehicle- and GA-treated RS WT hMSCs (passage 13), Scale bar, 20 μm. Data
  are shown as means ± SEM of ≥100 cells from three biological replicates. ***P <
  0.001 (t-test). (G) Representative western blot images of P21, LAP2β and Lamin B1
  proteins in vehicle- and GA-treated RS WT hMSCs (passage 14). (H) Immunostaining
  of γ-H2AX and 53BP1 in vehicle- and GA-treated RS WT hMSCs (passage 13), Scale bar,
  20 μm. White dashed lines represent the nuclear boundaries of cells. Data are shown
  as means ± SEM of ≥100 cells from three biological replicates. **P < 0.01 (t-test).
  (I) GO terms and pathways enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes
  (DEGs) in GA-treated WS hMSCs compared to vehicle (passage 9). (J) Heatmaps showing
  transcriptional levels of genes enriched in each representative GO term or pathway
  of GA-treated WS hMSCs compared to vehicle (passage 9). (K) GO terms and pathways
  enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in GA-treated HGPS
  hMSCs compared to vehicle (passage 8). (L) Metaplot showing the decreased ATAC signals
  at differential ATAC-seq peaks in GA-treated WS hMSCs compared to vehicle-treated
  WS hMSCs (passage 9). ***P < 0.001 (Wilcoxon test). (M) Genomic element enrichment
  analysis of opened and closed ATAC-seq peaks in GA-treated WS hMSCs compared to
  vehicle-treated WS hMSCs (passage 9). (N) Repetitive sequence element enrichment
  analysis of opened and closed ATAC-seq peaks in GA-treated WS hMSCs compared to
  vehicle-treated WS hMSCs (passage 9). (O) Clonal expansion ability of WS hMSCs (passage
  6) treated with vehicle, Quercetin (Que), Metformin (Met), or GA for 12 days. Data
  are shown as means ± SEM. n = 4 biological replicates. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 (t-test).
  (P) SA-β-Gal staining analysis of vehicle-, Que-, Met- and GA-treated WS hMSCs (passage
  7). The relative ratio normalized to vehicle control. Data are shown as means ±
  SEM of ≥300 cells from three biological replicates. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 (t-test).
  (Q) Clonal expansion ability analysis in vehicle-, EGCG- and GA-treated WS hMSCs
  (passage 6). The relative cell densities of the clones were measured at 15 days
  after seeding. Data are shown as means ± SEM. n = 4 biological replicates. **P <
  0.01, ***P < 0.001 (t-test). (R) Schematic diagram illustrating the geroprotective
  effects of GA on hMSCs. Reactive oxygen stress is abbreviated as ROS and DNA damage
  response is abbreviated as DDR

  for human stem cells.
