caption: Bar diagram illustrating the decarboxylation fluxes associated with different
  processes in the intermediate metabolism when the TCA cycle is completely open.
  These fluxes were determined from FBA and INST-MFA studies where the AKG decarboxylation
  rate = zero ( and ). Y-axis values correspond to carbon fluxes normalized to a value
  of 100 for net C assimilation. “Rubisco” and “PEP C” refer to C fixation by these
  enzymes. “PDH,” “ICDH,” “6-PG”, and “Photoresp” (photorespiration) refer to the
  rate of decarboxylations associated with each of those enzymes or substrates. “NU-decarboxylations”
  are nonphotorespiratory decarboxylations uncompensated by carboxylations in a related
  metabolic pathway. Equations used to calculate gross and net C assimilation are
  given in the text. Data are summarized in .
