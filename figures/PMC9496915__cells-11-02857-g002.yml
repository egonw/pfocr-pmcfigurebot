caption: 'Modes of action of mGluRs. The known functions of Group I, II, and III mGluRs
  upon activation by the natural ligand, glutamate, with the downstream PLC and adenylyl
  cyclase signaling pathways. The straight black arrows indicate the cellular signaling
  pathway. The green arrows indicate activation process, and the red arrows indicate
  inhibition process. The curved black arrows indicate conversion of one molecule
  to another. Abbreviations: metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR: protein; Grm:
  mouse gene; GRM: human gene), guanine diphosphate (GDP), guanine triphosphate (GTP),
  phospholipase C (PLC), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-diphosphate (PIP2), diacyl-glycerol
  (DAG), inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3), inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R),
  protein kinase C (PKC), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), cyclic adenosine monophosphate
  (cAMP), and protein kinase A (PKA). Parts of the figure were created using pictures
