caption: GA‐D prevents H2O2‐induced premature hAMSCs senescence through targeting
  14‐3‐3ε. (a) Coomassie (SimplyBlue) staining after DARTS assay. The red arrow indicates
  the undigested protein bound to GA‐D. (b) Protein bands after DARTS assay, showing
  the binding of small‐molecule GA‐D to the target protein 14‐3‐3ε. (c) Target validation
  by DARTS assay under different conditions. (d) Target validation by CETSA assay.
  (e) Theoretical binding model of GA‐D to the 14‐3‐3ε‐binding pocket. The ball and
  stick model of GA‐D; the protein is displayed in gray. (f) Specific interaction
  modes between GA‐D and 14‐3‐3ε. (g) Changes in 14‐3‐3ε‐encoding gene (YWHAE) mRNA
  expression in H2O2‐treated hAMSCs after GA‐D pretreatment. (h) Changes in 14‐3‐3ε
  expression in H2O2‐treated hAMSCs after GA‐D treatments. (i) The relative expression
  level of 14‐3‐3ε in H2O2‐treated hAMSCs after GA‐D treatments. N = 3. Control, control
  group; H2O2, senescent group; GA‐D, GA‐D treatment group; mock‐vehicle, GA‐D treatment
  group plus empty carrier; h‐14‐3‐3ε, GA‐D treatment group plus YWHAE overexpression;
  sh‐14‐3‐3ε, GA‐D treatment group plus YWHAE knockdown; , mean ± standard deviation;
  protease E, Streptomyces proteinase. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. CETSA, cellular thermal
  shift assay; DARTS, drug affinity‐responsive target stability; DMSO, dimethylsulfoxide;
  GA‐D, ganoderic acid D; H2O2, hydrogen peroxide; hAMSC, human amniotic mesenchymal
  stem cell; ROS, reactive oxygen species.
