caption: 'RBG blocks the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in MM cells. RPMI8226 cells were
  treated with different concentrations of RBG (2, 4 and 8 µM). The protein expression
  of AKT, p-AKT, PI3K and p-PI3K were detected using western blotting. *P<0.05, ***P<0.001
  vs. Control; ##P<0.01, ###P<0.001 vs. RBG (2 µM); &P<0.05, &&P<0.01 vs. RBG (4 µM).
  RBG, resibufogenin; p-phosphorylated.'
