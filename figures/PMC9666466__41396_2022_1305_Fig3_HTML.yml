figure_title: Clusters of orthologous group (COG) pathways across Chlamydiae indicate
  that sponge-associated chlamydiae have similar metabolic profiles to other members
  of their respective families
caption: 'Bars are coloured according to COG category and show the number of COGs identified
  from the pathway in the given genome. COG categories with similar profiles across
  Chlamydiae genomes were excluded but can be found in Fig.  and Data S. Sponge-associated
  chlamydiae MAGs are in blue, with relevant families coloured accordingly. Order
  and family names are indicated at the bottom with the following short forms: Criblamydiaceae
  (Crib.), Parilichlamydiaceae (Parili.), and Waddliaceae (Wad.). See Fig.  for an
  overview of relative pathway completeness and Data S for an overview of each COG
  across Chlamydiae genomes.'
