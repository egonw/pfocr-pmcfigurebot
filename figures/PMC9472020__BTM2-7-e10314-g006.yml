caption: Anti‐cancer effects of NTP therapy. (a) Melanoma tumor‐bearing mice were
  treated with NTP for 5 consecutive days. (b) The NTP system consisting of a microsecond‐pulsed
  power supply and a DBD applicator was used to generate NTP directly onto the tumor
  surface. (c) Immediately after the fifth day of NTP treatment, tumor volumes were
  significantly smaller compared to untreated controls (Ctrl). Data shown are mean ± SEM
  from two independent experiments (Ctrl, n = 8; NTP, n = 11). *p≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01,
  ***p ≤ 0.001 (generalized linear mixed model). (d) Tumor kinetics were monitored
  until humane endpoints were reached, and (e) Kaplan–Meier plots showed a significant
  increase in median survival in the NTP‐treated group. **p ≤ 0.01. Tumors were resected
  immediately after the last treatment (Day 7) or 3 (Day 10) or 7 (Day 14) days post.
  RNA sequencing and transcriptome profiling were performed using a preranked GSEA.
  (f) Several significantly (FDR ≤ 0.05) enriched pathways are shown. The IL‐6/JAK/STAT3
  was of particular interest, and (g) the top downregulated genes in the pathway from
  DEseq2 analysis are shown. Dotted lines indicate thresholds for uncorrected p ≤ 0.05
  (y axis) and log2fold change ≤−0.5 or ≥0.5 (x axis). Genes labeled in blue or red
  are above the uncorrected p value threshold (based on log2fold change threshold),
  while points in green (above log2fold change threshold) are not
