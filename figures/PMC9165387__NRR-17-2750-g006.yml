caption: 'The possible pathways of NLRP3-inflammasomes involved in NIHL.The first
  signal: noise stimulation activates the NF-κB signaling pathway via TLRs, increasing
  the production of NLRP3, pro-IL-18, and pro-IL-1β. The second signal: the NLRP3-inflammasome,
  IL-18 and IL-1β are activated by the buildup of ROS caused by acoustic trauma, which
  further promotes inflammation. ASC: Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing
  CARD; IL: interleukin; NF-κB: nuclear factor kappa-B; ROS: reactive oxygen species;
  TLR: Toll-like receptors; TNF: tumor necrosis factor.'
