caption: Mechanical loading induced increases bone formation and decreased sclerostin
  staining, particularly at the high strain locations of the ulnar diaphysis.() The
  upper image depicts load-induced bone formation rates (rBFR/BS), which were least
  at the lowest strain location (proximal), greater at the moderately-strained midshaft,
  and greatest at high strain location (distal) as indicated by the proximo-distal
  gradient in fluorochrome labeling of the periosteal surfaces. The lower image depicts
  the load-induced decrease in the percent of osteocytes staining positive for sclerostin
  (r%Sclr+), which was least at the lowest strain location (proximal), greater (though
  not significantly) at the moderately-strained midshaft, and greatest at high strain
  location (distal). Thus bone formation rates, measured 1-2 weeks after loading,
  were greatest at diaphyseal locations exhibiting the greatest reduction in sclerostin,
  measured a few days after loading, and vice versa. n=7-9 mice (16-wk old female
  C57BL/6) per group. *=significantly different from the proximal site; †=significantly
  different from the midshaft site, at p<0.05.
