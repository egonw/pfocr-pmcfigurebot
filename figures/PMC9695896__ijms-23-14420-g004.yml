caption: 'Gene ontology annotation. Upregulated biological processes (red bars) and
  downregulated processes (blue bars) sorted by p-value. Biological processes with
  the highest p-value are placed on the bottom, with the smallest p-value on the top
  (for both up- and downregulated processes): (A) SCAPs co-cultured with viable E.
  faecalis; (B) SCAPs co-cultured with E. faecalis supernatant; (C) SCAPs co-cultured
  with viable F. nucleatum; and (D) SCAPs co-cultured with F. nucleatum supernatants.
  Biological processes (upregulated or downregulated) that were similar between treatment
  with planktonic bacteria and corresponding supernatants are marked by red or blue
  frames, respectively. ER: endoplasmic reticulum, STK: serine/threonine kinase, PERK:
  PKR-like ER kinase, ASP: apoptotic signaling pathway.'
