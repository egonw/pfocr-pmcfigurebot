figure_title: PMK-1 signaling is regulated by caspase cleavage supporting tissue homeostasis
caption: 'a mRNA-Seq analysis to identify pmk-1-dependent genes regulated by caspase
  cleavage in day 1 young adults. n = 3 biological replicates for each genotype. FDR < 0.1
  for pmk-1(-). Log2-fold change of each replicate for pmk-1(-) and pmk-1(D327E) compared
  to wt was shown as heat map. b Pathway enrichment of PMK-1 regulated genes. c-d
  pmk-1-dependent sensory neuron and lysosome genes for daf-16 dependence. PMK-1-dependent
  genes clustered by inverse regulation with PMK-1(D327E) and plotted with Log2-fold
  change compared to wild type. n = 2 biological replicates. e Frequency of transcription
  factor binding sites in proximal promoters of pmk-1 dependent genes (Datasource:
  Wormbase). f Diagram depicting overlapping of change in polyubiquitinated protein
  shared between pmk-1(-) and pmk-1(CTΔ) compared to wild type. n = 3 biological replicates.
  g Heatmap of Log2 Fold change of polyubiquitinated proteins that are inversely regulated
  by pmk-1(-) and pmk-1(D327E) compared to wild type. n = 3 biological replicates.
  h Pathway enrichment of polyubiquinated proteins that are inversely regulated by
  pmk-1(-) and pmk-1(D327E). b, h Wormbase GeneSet Enrichment tool. Source data are
  provided as a Source Data file.'
