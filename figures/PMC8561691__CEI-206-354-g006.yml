caption: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients showed altered peripheral B cell homeostasis
  and functions. (a) Representative flow cytometry charts depicting the gating strategy
  for CD19+CD27+CD24highregulatory B cells, CD19+CD27+CD38high plasmablasts and CD19+CD138+
  plasma cells. (b,c) Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from
  RA patients and healthy controls (HC), and the frequencies of CD19+CD27+CD24highregulatory
  B cells (b), CD19+CD27+CD38high plasmablasts (c) and CD19+CD138+ plasma cells (d)
  were determined with flow cytometry assay (n = 15). (e) The serum levels of immunoglobulin
  (Ig)M and IgG in RA patients and HC were measured with enzyme‐linked immunosorbent
  assay (ELISA) assay (n = 15). (f) CD19+ B cells were sorted with magnetic beads
  from PBMCs of RA patients and HC and carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester
  (CFSE)‐labeled B cells were analyzed with flow cytometry assay at 5 days (n = 5).
  (g,h) PBMCs were isolated from RA patients and HC and the frequency of CD19+ Annvien
  V+ B cells (g) and the expressions of CD80 and CD86 (h) on CD19+ B cells were detected
  with flow cytometry assay (n = 5). **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; NS = no significance
