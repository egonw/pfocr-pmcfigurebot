caption: 'FTZ reduces collagen synthesis in vitro. (a)–(d) RT-qPCR to determine the
  expression of Col1A2, Col3, CTGF, and α-SMA. n = 5 per group. (e)–(h) Col1A2, Col3,
  and α-SMA expression were determined using western blotting. n = 5 per group. Data
  are presented as the mean ± SEM. ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 versus the control group
  and #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01 versus the Ang-II group.'
