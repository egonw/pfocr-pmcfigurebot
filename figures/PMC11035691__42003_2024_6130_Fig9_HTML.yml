figure_title: Impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection and PAV-104 treatment on the transcriptome
  of primary AECs
caption: a–c Volcano plots showing the proportion of differentially expressed genes
  (DEGs) in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection (MOI = 0.1) (SARS-CoV-2 infection
  vs Control (SC)) (a), SARS-CoV-2 infection in the presence of PAV-104 (SARS-CoV-2
  infection+PAV-104 vs Control (PC)), and SARS-CoV-2 infection in the presence of
  PAV-104 vs SARS-CoV-2 infection (PS). DEGs (FDR < 0.05) with log2(fold change) >0.5
  are indicated in red. DEGs (FDR < 0.05) with log2(fold change) < −0.5 are indicated
  in blue. The absolute value of Log2(fold change) <0.5 and non-significant DEGs are
  indicated in gray. d Sample coverage tracks from the QIAGEN genome browser depicting
  SARS-CoV-2 assembly. Mapped read counts of Control, SARS-CoV-2 infection, and SARS-CoV-2
  infection in the presence of PAV-104 (SARS-CoV-2 infection+PAV-104) are 0 to 3,
  0 to 392,760, and 0 to 1790, respectively. e Scatter plot highlighting SARS-CoV-2
  infection-regulated genes reversed by PAV-104. The X axis indicates the log2 fold
  change between the SARS-CoV-2 infection+PAV-104 treatment group and control. The
  Y axis indicates that log2 fold change between SARS-CoV-2 infection and control.
  Red points denote genes significantly induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and significantly
  reversed by PAV-104 treatment. f Top enriched REACTOME pathways in response to SARS-CoV-2
  infection or PAV-104 treatment identified using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA).
  The orange and blue-colored bars in the bar chart indicate predicted pathway activation
  or predicted inhibition, respectively, based on enrichment score. Y represents FDR < 0.25.
