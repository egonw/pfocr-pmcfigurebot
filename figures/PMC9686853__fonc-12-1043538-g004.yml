caption: Mutant p53 is required for cisplatin-induced ATM and 53BP1 activations and
  integrin α6β4-mediated sensitivity to cisplatin. P53 was knocked down by siRNA in
  BT549 EV and BT549 β4 cells (A, B) or knocked out by CRISPR/Cas9 in BT549 β4 cells
  (C, D), then cells were plated on laminin-1-coated plates and treated with 10µM
  cisplatin for 24h prior to harvesting for immunoblotting analysis (A, C). Fold differences
  were quantified from three separate experiments, normalized to respective total
  protein (for p-ATM S1981 and p-53BP1 S1778) or actin for cleavage PARP-1 (cPARP-1)
  and γH2AX and reported relative to their respective untreated controls indicated
  (B, D). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.005, ***p < 0.001.
