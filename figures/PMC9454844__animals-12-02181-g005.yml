caption: Functional annotations of the selected SNPs based on KEGG pathways and GO
  terms. (A) Venn diagram of significant KEGG pathways; (B) six common signaling pathways;
  (C) Venn diagram of significant GO terms; (D) 23 common GO terms. YL, Yalong River;
  JS, Jinsha River; WJ, Wujiang River. The Notch signaling pathway was common in the
  YL vs. WJ, JS vs. WJ, and JS vs. YL groups.
