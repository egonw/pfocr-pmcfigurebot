caption: 'Over‐compensated expression patterns to acute environmental changes during
  a storm in Acanthochromis polyacanthus individuals at the CO2 seep. (a) Two trends
  of expression changes are detected in 1399 common differentially expressed genes
  (DEGs) between storm versus CO2 seep individuals, and control versus CO2 seep individuals.
  For illustration purposes, a subset (right: 52 genes; left: 51genes) of these common
  DEGs with normalized reads counts <= 200 were selected. Gene expression increased
  (left) or decreased (right) from control reef to CO2 seep but over‐compensated from
  CO2 seep to storm by a downregulation (left) or upregulation (right). (b) The number
  of DEGs increased from CO2 seep to storm in core circadian rhythm genes, ion transporters,
  and those related to pHi regulation, immune response and the GABAergic pathway'
