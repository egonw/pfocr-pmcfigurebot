figure_title: A Subset of Genes are Regulated by TRβ in Breast and Thyroid Cancer
  Cells
caption: A) A 4-way venn diagram comparing the significantly up- and down-regulated
  genes in both T3-treated 468-EV and 468-TRβ cells and T3-treated SW1736-EV and SW1736-TRβ
  cells (n=3). 255 genes were upregulated and 70 genes were repressed independent
  of cell type. B) IPA was used to predict the canonical signaling pathways of these
  325 genes. Shown is the color for the associated activation Z-score and size corresponds
  to the gene ratio for each enriched each pathway (p<0.01). C-D) Bar plots showing
  the normalized RNA-seq expression counts for genes encoding stearate biosynthetic
  enzymes MDA-MB-468 and SW1736 cell lines expressing empty vector or TRβ. E) Percentage
  of fatty acids within Vehicle or T3-treated (10 nM) in 468-EV and 468-TRβ cells
  after 24 and 48h. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, *****p<0.0001.
