caption: The Glutamate and GABA metabolic pathways are altered in MELAS cells. (A)
  Graphical representation of the glutamate pathway and TCA cycle. GAD1 (glutamate
  decarboxylase), ABAT (4 aminobutyrate transaminase), and GDH (glutamate dehydrogenase).
  (B) Measurement of GDH activity, (C) intracellular levels of αKG concentration,
  and (D) intracellular levels of GABA in Ctrl and 98% MT cells, exposed for 48 h
  with (+) or without (−) KB. (E1) Western blots showing GAD1, ABAT, and GDH expression
  profiles in Ctrl and 98% MT cells, treated for 48 h with (+) or without (−) KB.
  (E2) Quantification of GAD1, ABAT, and GDH relative expression related to tubulin
  and actin in Ctrl and 98% MT cells treated with (+) or without (−) KB. Results are
  presented as the mean ± SEM, relative to Ctrl cells of at least 4 independent experiments.
  Statistical differences between 98% MT and Ctrl cells are indicated with an asterisk
  (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001).
