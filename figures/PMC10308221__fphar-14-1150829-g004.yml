caption: Tetrandrine triggers cell cycle in HBZY-1 cells. Cells stimulated by deS/deGal
  IgA were treated with different concentrations of tetrandrine (0, 1, 2.5 and 3 μM)
  for 48 h. (A) Cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometer. The peaks marked in the
  figure represent G0/G1, S and G2/M phases in the cell cycle, respectively. (B) Percentages
  of cell numbers in the cell cycle after 48 h of the agent treatment were. (C) The
  cell lysates were examined by Western blot. β-actin was used as internal control.
  More than three independent experiments were carried out and representative results
  were shown in the figures. Statistical analyses were performed using Bonferroni’s
  multiple comparison tests, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001 as compared to
  the group treated by blank solvent respectively. (n = 6).
