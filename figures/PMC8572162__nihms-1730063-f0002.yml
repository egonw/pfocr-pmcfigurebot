caption: Metabolomic pathway analysis, generated by MetaboAnalyst software, for plasma
  metabolites (A) and gut metabolites (B). Circles indicate the matched pathways.
  The color of each circle changes according to the p-values (more significant changes
  of metabolites in the pathway are shown by darker colors), while the pathway impact
  score is depicted by the size of the circle. The most impacted pathways with the
  highest statistical significance scores are annotated for clarity. In plasma the
  raw P-values were 0.006, 0.01, and 0.02 for glycerophospholipid metabolism, glycine,
  serine and threonine metabolism, and caffeine metabolism, respectively. In stool,
  the raw P-values for the two significant pathways, histidine metabolism, and caffeine
  metabolism, were 0.03 and 0.04, respectively.
