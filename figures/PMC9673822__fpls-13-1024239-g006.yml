caption: Verification of six selected DEGs by qRT-PCR. Comparison of RNA-seq data
  (Blue line chart) with qRT-PCR data (Yellow bar graph). The relative qRT-PCR expression
  level of selected DEGs is shown on the y-axis to the left. β-tubulin (TUB) was used
  as the internal control. Three biological replicates were used. The normalized expression
  level (FPKM; expected number of Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript sequence per
  Millions base pairs sequenced) of RNA-seq is indicated on the y-axis to the left.
