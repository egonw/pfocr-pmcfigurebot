caption: ER stress-dependent pathway was not significantly involved in HDAC inhibitors-resistant
  HA22T cells. (A, B) Protein expression levels of CRT-regulated ER stress pathway
  proteins (GRP78, p-PERK, p-eIF2, ERp57 and CRT) are measured by western blotting
  analysis. (C) Effect of thapsigargin (TG)-induced ER stress on the cell viability
  of liver cancer cells. Liver cancer cells are incubated with different concentration
  of TG for 24 h and cell viability is tested by MTT assay. (D, E) Expression of CRT-regulated
  ER stress pathway proteins (GRP78, p-PERK, p-eIF2, ERp57 and CRT) are measured using
  western blotting. All protein samples are analyzed by western blotting. Protein
  expression is normalized to expression of GAPDH. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 compared
  with control group.
