caption: BMSCs-EVs inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of OS cells
  and promoted apoptosis. Human OS cells were cultured in vitro and treated with EVs.
  A) miR-206 level in human osteoblasts hFOB 1.19 and OS cells 143B, MG-63, Saos2,
  and HOS was detected by RT-qPCR. B) The uptake of EVs by OS cells was detected using
  immunofluorescence (C) EdU assay showed that 143B cell proliferation was inhibited.
  D) Flow cytometry demonstrated that apoptosis was increased. E) Transwell assay
  showed that cell migration (above) and invasion (below) were inhibited. Three cell
  tests were performed and the data were expressed as mean Â± SD. Oneway ANOVA was
  used for comparison among groups. Tukey's multiple comparisons test was used for
  post-hoc test; **p<0.01.
