caption: C-to-U RESs associated with responses to anti-PD1 immunotherapy treatment.
  (A) Differential editing of CST3, a verified modulator of anti-PD1 response, were
  observed in both Hugo2016 and Riaz2017 datasets. (B) Differential editing of TPI1,
  a suggestive effector of the anti-PD1 response, was observed in both the Hugo2016
  and Riaz2017 datasets. (C) Differential editing of TNC, a reported synergistic cofactor
  of anti-PD1 response, were observed in both before and during anti-PD1 treatment
  of the Riaz2017 dataset. (D) Pathway enrichment for genes with anti-PD1 response-associated
  RESs and shared between both Hugo2016 and Riaz2017 datasets. Bar colors were -log10
  P-values of enrichment. (A–C) One-sided chi-squared test.
