caption: MicroRNAs targeting receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway in esophageal
  squamous cell carcinoma metastasis. The receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) signaling
  pathway effect many signals, including epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast
  growth factor (FGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hepatocyte growth
  factor (HGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and their receptors, as well as intracellular
  signaling pathways, such as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K). The dysregulation of miRNAs on the RTK signaling pathway is play
  important roles in ESCC metastasis[,,,,,,,-,,,,,,,,,,-,-,,,,,,-,,,,-,-,,,,,,-,,,,,,,,,-,-,,,,,,,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-,,-,,,,,,,,-,].
  ZEB1/2, Snail1/2, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, C-myc, Vimentin and MMPs are specific
  target and key factors for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma metastasis. “Green”
  and “Red” indicated oncomiRs and tumor-suppressive miRNAs, respectively. The dashed
  arrow and solid arrow indicated direct targeting effect and indirect targeting effect,
  respectively.
