caption: Artemisinin effects on ergosterol and acetyl-CoA synthesis through PDR1.
  (A) Transcription level of Cdr2 with artemisinin. Incubation time were 20 min and
  2 h, respectively. Data are mean ± SD of three independent experiments. Data were
  analyzed by GraphPad Prism. *** p-value < 0.0005. (B) Ergosterol synthesis pathway.
  (C) Genes involved in ergosterol synthesis pathway were downregulated with artemisinin.
  (D) Erg1, Erg3, Erg9 and Erg11 transcription levels had no significant change with
  artemisinin in PDR1 mutants. (E) Acetyl-CoA synthesis pathway. (F) Acs1 but not
  Acs2 or Pdh complex was upregulated in the presence of artemisinin. (G) Acs1 transcription
  level had no significant change with artemisinin in PDR1 mutant strains. Data are
  mean ± SD of three independent experiments. Data were analyzed by GraphPad Prism.
  * p-value < 0.05, ** p-value < 0.005, *** p-value < 0.0005, and ns means no significant
  change (p-value > 0.05).
