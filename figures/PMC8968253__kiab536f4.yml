caption: 'Effect of exogenous Put on the growth of P. indica and tomato and alteration
  in the expression of genes involved in the Put biosynthetic pathway in tomato upon
  P. indica (Pi) colonization. A, Expression of ADC (SlADC) and ODC (SlODC) transcript
  levels (mean ± se) 40 dpi with P. indica (n = 4). Note: Owing to small values, the
  error bars of the Controls for SlADC1 and SlADC2 have merged with the mean bars.
  B, Quantification of radial growth of P. indica upon 10 µM Put treatment (n = 10).
  Inset shows the visualization of the radial growth. C, Visualization of root growth
  in tomato seedlings upon Put treatment (10 µM). Scale bar: ∼4.5 cm. The figure is
  the representative of 10 replicates. Quantification of (D) shoot fresh weight and
  (E) root fresh weight of tomato and visualization of root growth upon treatment
  with Put (10 µM) (n = 10). Scale bar: ∼4 cm. F, Fresh weight of tomato seedlings
  upon treatment with 10 µM Gluconic Acid (GlucA) and 10 µM Put. For all box plots,
  box limit: percentile 25–75; whisker limit: percentile 5–95; centerline: mean. All
  significance analysis was done by unpaired t test; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001,
  ****P < 0.0001.'
