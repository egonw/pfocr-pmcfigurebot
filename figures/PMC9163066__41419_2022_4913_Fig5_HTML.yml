figure_title: miR-140-3p and miR-335 can partially rescue the tumor-suppression effects
  caused by the knockdown of circSCAF8 in PCa cells
caption: A, B EDU and colony formation assays were carried out to detect the proliferation
  ability of PC3 cells in the circSCAF8 knockdown group after being transfected with
  miR-140-3p inhibitors, miR-335 inhibitors, and miR-140-3p/miR-335 inhibitors, respectively.
  C–E The invasion and migration abilities of PC3 cells with circSCAF8 knockdown treated
  with miR-140-3p inhibitors, miR-335 inhibitors, and miR-140-3p/miR-335 inhibitors
  were measured by transwell invasion assay C, transwell migration assay (D), and
  wound healing assay (E). Error bars represent the SD of three independent experiments.
