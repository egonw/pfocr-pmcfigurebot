caption: β‐arrestin signalling pathway. Schematic elucidating the mechanism of gain‐of‐function
  induced by a mutation (yellow diamond) in the melanocortin 4‐receptor (MC4R). The
  mutation causes an increase in the cell‐surface expression of MC4R, possibly via
  reduced internalization or rapid recycling, causing increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate
  (cAMP) production, as well as increased production of protein kinase A (PKA) and
  cAMP‐regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Epac). AC, adenylyl cyclase;
  GDP, guanosine diphosphate; GTP, guanosine triphosphate; MSH, melanocyte‐stimulating
  hormone;
