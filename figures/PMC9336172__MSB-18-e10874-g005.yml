figure_title: Different metabolic dependencies of Wnt‐high and Wnt‐low CRC cell lines
  with or without Wnt hyperactivation
caption: ASelection of gene set enrichment analysis results for CRISPR screening results
  in our engineered cell lines as well as in the DepMap datasets. Gene sets for which
  the enrichment analysis indicated adjusted P‐values > 0.05 are depicted in gray.
  Negative enrichment scores in green indicate a higher essentiality of the respective
  gene sets in APCtrunc compared with APCWT cell lines (HCT116 and RKO) or Wnt‐high
  compared to Wnt‐low (DepMap).B, CDifferential gene essentiality in Wnt‐high versus
  Wnt‐low cell lines (DepMap project) displayed as logarithmic fold change (logFC).
  Negative logFC indicates genes that are more essential in Wnt‐high cell lines compared
  with Wnt‐low cell lines. Genes involved in mitochondrial translation (E) and mitochondrial
  tRNA aminoacylation (F) are highlighted in black. Gene set enrichment analysis indicated
  a positive enrichment score for both pathways. Genes involved in mitochondrial translation
  (B, Reactome R‐HSA‐5368287) and mitochondrial tRNA aminoacylation (C, Reactome R‐HSA‐379726)
  are highlighted in black. Selected genes of interest belonging to this pathway are
  highlighted and labeled in green.D, ECorrelation of differential gene essentialities
  in APCtrunc versus APCWT HCT116 (x‐axis) and RKO (y‐axis) cell lines displayed as
  logarithmic fold change (logFC). Negative logFC indicates genes that are more essential
  in APCtrunc compared to APCWT cells. Gene set definition, color and labeling as
  in (B, C).FViability effects of single gRNAs targeting LARS2, MRPL13 and MTIF2.
  Logarithmic fold changes of gRNA abundance in the screening endpoint compared to
  the plasmid library are displayed for APCtrunc (y‐axis) and APCWT (x‐axis) for HCT116
  (left panel) and RKO (right panel) cells. Red and blue circles indicate results
  for replicates 1 and 2 of the CRISPR screen. Mean fold changes of negative control
  gRNAs (targeting luciferase) are displayed as black circles. Mean fold changes of
  positive control gRNAs (chromosome 10 promiscuous) are displayed as black triangles.
