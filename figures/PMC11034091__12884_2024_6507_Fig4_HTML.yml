caption: 'KEGG enrichment scatterplots (a) and net (b) of differential cord blood
  metabolites. A the prepregnancy overweight/obesity group vs. the control group;
  B the excessive GWG group vs. the control group. (1) positive metabolites; (2) negative
  metabolites. Notes: (a) The horizontal co-ordinates in the figure are x/y (the number
  of differential metabolites in the corresponding metabolic pathway/the total number
  of total metabolites identified in this pathway). The value represents the enrichment
  degree of differential metabolites in the pathway. The color of the point rep-resents
  the P-value of the hypergeometric test, and the size of the point represents the
  number of differential metabolites in the corresponding pathway. (b) The red dot
  represents a metabolic pathway, the yellow dot represents a substance-related regulatory
  enzyme information, the green dot represents the background substance of a metabolic
  pathway, the purple dot represents the molecular module information of a class of
  substances, the blue dot represents a substance chemical reaction, and the green
  square represents the differential substance obtained by this comparison'
