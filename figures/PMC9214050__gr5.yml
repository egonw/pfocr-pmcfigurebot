caption: Ts21 ventral progenitors have decreased WNT and increased GLI3 expression(A
  and B) Quantitative PCR of SHH pathway genes (A) WNT signaling genes (B) in two
  iPSC lines of Ts21 and isogenic control lines.(C) Expression of SHH and WNT pathway
  genes in human fetal control and DS brain (14–17 weeks gestation, dorsolateral forebrain,
  ).(D) Quantitative PCR of GLI genes in progenitor cells and in human fetal control
  and DS brain (). Statistical significance was determined by one-sample t test on
  ddCt values. ∗p < 0.05, N = 3 for each gene/line.(E) The effects of activation of
  WNT via addition of a WNT agonist (CHIR, 0.4 and 1.2 μm) with SHH on COUP-TFII/NR2F2
  gene expression, proportion of COUP-TFII+ cells, and GLI3 expression. Statistical
  significance was determined by one-sample t test on ddCt values. ∗p < 0.05, N =
  3 replicates in one pair of isogenic control and Ts21 cells.
