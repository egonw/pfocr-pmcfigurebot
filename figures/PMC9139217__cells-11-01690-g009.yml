caption: 'Leydig cells failed to self recover after removing cisplatin. (A) CCK8 was
  used to determine the relative cell viability of Leydig cells treated with 8 μg/mL
  cisplatin and removal of cisplatin recovery for 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, and 24 h. (B)
  Determination of Bcl-2 and Bax protein levels was performed by Western blotting
  in Leydig cells treated with 8 μg/mL of cisplatin and removal of cisplatin recovery
  for 4 h and 8 h. The blots were quantified using Image J software. (C) Content of
  testosterone in Leydig cells treated with 8 μg/mL of cisplatin and removal of cisplatin
  recovery for 4 h and 8 h. (D) Flow cytometry was used to measure the concentrations
  of reactive oxygen species in Leydig cells treated with 8 μg/mL of cisplatin and
  removal of cisplatin recovery for 4 h and 8 h; ROS were detected by DCFH-DA staining.
  (E) Determination of MT1 and MT2 protein levels was performed by Western blotting
  in Leydig cells treated with 8 μg/mL cisplatin and removal of cisplatin recovery
  for 4 h and 8 h. The blots were quantified using Image J software. (F) Determination
  of Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 protein levels was performed by Western blotting in Leydig
  cells treated with 8 μg/mL cisplatin and removal of cisplatin with recovery for
  4 h and 8 h. The blots were quantified using Image J software. (G) Determination
  of SIRT1, SOD1, and SOD2 protein levels was performed by Western blotting in Leydig
  cells treated with 8 μg/mL cisplatin and removal of cisplatin with recovery for
  4 h and 8 h. The blots were quantified using Image J software. CP, cisplatin. Re,
  recovery. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM (N = 4 per group). * p < 0.05 or
  ** p < 0.01 compared with controls. # p < 0.05 or ## p < 0.01 compared with CP groups.'
