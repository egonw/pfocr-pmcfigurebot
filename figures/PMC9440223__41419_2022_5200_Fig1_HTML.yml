figure_title: KCTD9 is downregulated in CRC
caption: 'A Venn diagram showing intersecting downregulated differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs), as assessed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) results of three tissue samples
  from our hospital, and other public datasets: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-COAD,
  GSE39582 and GSE75970. RNAseq_DEGs_Down: DEGs with consistently descending expressed
  trends among the adjacent normal colonic mucosa, primary colon adenocarcinoma and
  distant liver metastasis were identified from the RNA-seq data of three tissue samples
  in our hospital. COAD_DEGs_Down: DEGs downregulated between COAD vs. Normal groups
  based on TCGA-COAD data. COAD_DEGs_OS_Sig: DEGs significantly associated with overall
  survival (OS) of TCGA-COAD data predicted by both univariable cox and log-rank methods.
  GEO_DEGs_Down: Intersected DEGs downregulated between COAD/CRC vs. Normal groups
  based on GSE39582 and GSE75970 data. B Comparative expression of KCTD9 in normal
  colonic epithelium, primary and metastatic CRC tissues determined using the TNMplot
  web tool. C Western blot analysis of KCTD9 expression in 12 matched pairs of human
  CRC tissues and adjacent normal colonic tissues collected during resection (n = 12).
  β-actin was used as a loading control throughout. Relative density were quantified
  by using ImageJ software. D, E Tissue microarrays containing 80 pairs of human CRC
  tissues and adjacent normal colon tissues were analyzed for KCTD9 expression using
  immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Representative staining in normal colon gland
  epithelium and adenocarcinoma tissues (D) (n = 80). Quantification of IHC staining
  in D as immunoreactive scores (IRS) E mean ± SD, n = 80, two-tailed Student’s t
  test, ***p < 0.001. Comparative analysis of KCTD9 expression in the normal human
  colon mucosal epithelial cell line NCM460 and a panel of CRC-derived cell lines
  using qRT-PCR (F) and Western blotting (G). G Is represent three independent experiments
  (top) and relative density were quantified by using ImageJ software (bottom). F,
  G Are mean ± SD; n = 3 independent experiments, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple
  comparison post-test, ns not significant, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.'
