caption: Enriched KEGG pathways in the treated versus the control embryos of sterlet
  (A. ruthenus). (A) Overlap in the enriched KEGG pathways between treatments; (B)
  visualization of the level of significance and number of representative DEGs found
  in each pathway for each treatment group. The color scale represents adjusted p-values
  less than 0.05, with empty circles showing those greater than 0.05. The size of
  the circle represents the number of significantly differentially expressed genes
  that are part of the given KEGG pathway.
