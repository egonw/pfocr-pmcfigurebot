caption: Dysregulation of enzymes regulating pyrimidine metabolism in drug‐resistant
  cells. (A) Metabolic pathway of DAC and AZA. AZA and DAC undergo multistep phosphorylation,
  and are incorporated into DNA and RNA. (B) Amounts of enzymes for pyrimidine metabolism
  enzymes (DCK, UCK2, UCK1 and DCTD) in each drug‐resistant cell line and parental
  cell line were determined by immunoblotting. (C) Signal intensity of UCK2, DCK and
  DCTD on western blots. Graphs show relative expression levels (compared to each
  parental cell line), after normalization to tubulin expression
