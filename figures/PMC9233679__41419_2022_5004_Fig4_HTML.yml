figure_title: S100A11 promotes the survival and biosynthesis of PDAC cells by regulating
  TKT expression
caption: A Control or S100A11-knockdown PDAC cells were transfected with or without
  ectopic FLAG-tagged TKT and western blot analysis was performed using the indicated
  antibodies. B–D Control or S100A11-knockdown PDAC cells were transfected with empty
  or FLAG-tagged TKT plasmid. PPP flux was analysed using NMR. De novo DNA synthesis
  was analysed using EdU incorporation. Cellular NADPH level was measured in PDAC
  cells after S100A11 knockdown. E, F In the above cells, the effect of TKT on proliferation
  and migration was confirmed by colony formation and Transwell assays. n.s., not
  significant. *p < 0.05. Error bars indicate mean ± SD.
