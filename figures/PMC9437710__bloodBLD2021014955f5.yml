caption: Effect of sutimlimab on classical complement pathway activity. (A) In the
  Wieslab Complement System Classical Pathway assay, the normal range in serum is
  69% to 129%. (B) The International System of Units reference range for serum C4
  is 0.18 to 0.45 g/L. Baseline classical complement pathway activity and total C4
  levels below the normal ranges are expected in CAD and are consistent with the nature
  of this disease. B, baseline; C4, complement component 4; CP, classical complement
  pathway.
