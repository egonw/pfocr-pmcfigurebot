caption: Compartmental cell identity is altered upon Hedgehog pathway inhibition.
  RT-qPCR for SOX2 (A), SOX9 (B), and ACTA2 (C) in fetal lung explants treated with
  5E1 compared to control. Results are shown as mean ± SEM, * p < 0.05, n = 6 for
  each group. (D–H) Western blot analysis of protein expression of SOX2 (D,E), SOX9
  (F,G), and ACTA2 (H,I) in 5E1 treated explants compared to control (n = 3 for each
  condition). Western blot densitometry ratios are shown in (E,G,I) (n = 3 for each
  condition). Results are shown as mean ± SEM. IF staining of fetal lung explants
  treated (K) or not (J) with 5E1 for SOX2 (green), SOX9 (white), and ACTA2 (red).
  Quantification of the number of epithelial positive SOX2 cells (L) and SOX9 (M)
  (n = 4 for each group). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01; ns = no stress.
