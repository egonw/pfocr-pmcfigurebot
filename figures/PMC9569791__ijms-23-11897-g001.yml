caption: Expression of the Hippo signaling components in shrimp infected with bacteria
  and fungi. The mRNA levels of Hippo (A), Wts (B), and Yki (C) in hemocytes after
  V. parahaemolyticus (Vpa), S. aureus (Sau), A. niger (Ani), LPS, and the control
  PBS were detected using relative qPCR. For each challenge group, the data at 0 h
  was set as 1.0 after normalizing to the geometric mean expression of the internal
  controls β-actin and Ef-1α. Values with different letters indicated significant
  differences by one-way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test (p < 0.05).
