figure_title: Comprehensive functional profiling of cellular states in CRC
caption: a Circos plot depicting the enriched cancer hallmark and immune-related pathways
  for genes highly expressed in cellular states in CRC. Cellular states across cell
  types are organized on the left and pathways are on the right, widths of the links
  are corresponding to the proportion of genes enriched in pathways. b Scatter plot
  showing the normalized enrichment scores (NES) of pathways in fibroblasts S03 cell
  states. Pathways are ranked by NES. Colors of dots are corresponding to the p-values.
  c The enrichment score (ES) distribution for the genes differentially expressed
  in fibroblast cell state S03 enriched in five pathways. Each line is for a pathway.
