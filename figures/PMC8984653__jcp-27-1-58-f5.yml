figure_title: Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) level in HepG2 cells
caption: HepG2 cells (3 × 104 cells/100 μL) were cultured in normal medium, combined
  fatty acids (CFA) medium or CFA plus 10 μM of 6-(methylsulfinyl) hexyl isothiocyanate
  (6-MSITC) medium. After 12, 24, and 48 hours incubation, the cellular TBARS levels
  were measured as described in Material and Methods. The data were from triplicate
  tests. * P < 0.05.
