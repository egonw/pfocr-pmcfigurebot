caption: Changes of plant hormone synthesis and signal transduction pathway unigenes
  during the development of the C. sinense ovule. (A) Expression analysis of auxin
  synthesis signal transduction pathway unigenes. ARF, auxin response factor; AUX/IAA,
  auxin/indole acetic acid protein; GH3, Gretchen Hagen; SAUR, small auxin-up RNAs;
  YUC, indole-3-pyruvate monooxygenase. (B) Expression analysis of cytokinin synthesis
  and signal transduction pathway unigenes. A-ARR, type-A Arabidopsis response regulator;
  AHP, histidine-containing phosphotransfer protein; CYP735A, cytokinin hydroxylase;
  IPT, adenylate isopentenyltransferase. (C) Expression analysis of GA synthesis and
  signal transduction pathway unigenes. GA, Ent-kaurene oxidase; GA2OX, Gibberellin
  2-beta-dioxygenase; GA20ox1B, Gibberellin 20 oxidase 1-B; GA3OX, Gibberellin 3-beta-dioxygenase.
  (D) Expression analysis of ABA synthesis and signal transduction pathway unigenes.
  CYP707A5, CP450; abscisic acid 8â€™-hydroxylase; NCED, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase;
  PP2C, protein phosphatase-2C. (E) Expression analysis of brassinosteroid synthesis
  and signal transduction pathway unigenes. BKI1, BRI1 kinase inhibitor 1-like; BZR1,
  protein BZR1 homolog 1-like; CYP734A, cytochrome P450 734A; CYP85A1, cytochrome
  P450 85A1; CYP90B1, cytochrome P450 90B1. (F) Expression analysis of JA synthesis
  and signal transduction pathway genes. AOC, Allene oxide cyclase; AOS, Allene oxide
  synthase; NPR1, BTB/POZ domain and ankyrin repeat-containing protein NPR1-like;
  OPR, 12-oxophytodienoate reductase. The color of each box represents the log2(FPKM
  + 1) value.
