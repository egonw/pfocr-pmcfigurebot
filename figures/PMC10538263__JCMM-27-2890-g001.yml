caption: SNORA73B exhibits an oncogenic role by targeting MIB1 via DKC1‐related pseudouridine
  modification and activates the Notch pathway. (A–D) Downregulation of MIB1 could
  partially retain the tumorigenesis function of SNORA73B, such as proliferation,
  migration, and invasion. DKC1 knockdown reduces cell proliferation and promotes
  cell apoptosis. (E) After small interfering RNA for DKC1 (si‐DKC1) transfection,
  DKC1 levels decreased. (F) Under conditions of DKC1 knockdown, overexpression or
  knockdown of SNORA73B did not affect mindbomb E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (MIB1)
  levels. (G) SNORA73B expression and MIB1 levels were significantly higher in the
  xenograft tumours of the SNORA73B group than in the vector group. (H) In cells overexpressing
  SNORA73B, Notch1, Notch2, and Notch3 expression was upregulated. In SNORA73B knockdown
  cells, Notch1, Notch2, and Notch3 expressions were inhibited. (I) After downregulating
  MIB1 expression in SNORA73B high‐expression cells, levels of Notch1, Notch2, and
  Notch3 showed that the activation of the Notch pathway by SNORA73B was partially
  offset. (J) Co‐immunoprecipitation results showed that the ubiquitin level of Jag
  1 increased because of SNORA73B overexpression. HEC‐1B transfected with SNORA73B
  plasmids were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti‐Jag 1 bead. Input
  lysates were immunoblotted with antibodies against Jag 1 and MIB1 with glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate
  dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as an internal reference. (K) Schematic diagram of the mechanism
  of SNORA73B promoting Jag 1 ubiquitination modification and then activating the
  Notch pathway via MIB1. There were at least three samples in each Western‐blot experiment.
  Data are shown as the mean ± SD (error bars). *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 (Student's
  t‐test).
