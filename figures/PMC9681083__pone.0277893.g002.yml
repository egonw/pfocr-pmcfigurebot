figure_title: FD268 induces cell cycle arrest in HL-60 and MOLM-16 cells
caption: (A) Induction of cell cycle arrest by FD268 at the increasing concentrations
  for 24 h in HL-60 and MOLM-16. Cell cycle phase analysis was performed by flow cytometry.
  (B) Quantitation of the G0/G1, S, and G2 phase cells of HL-60 and MOLM-16. The data
  shown are the mean Â± standard from two independent experiments. Statistical differences
  compared to control group were analyzed with one-way ANOVA. Statistical significance
  is represented with asterisks *P < 0.05 and ***P < 0.001.
article_title: A pyridinesulfonamide derivative FD268 suppresses cell proliferation
  and induces apoptosis via inhibiting PI3K pathway in acute myeloid leukemia.
