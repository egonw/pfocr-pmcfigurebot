caption: Details of the reentrant AT in cases 2 and 6. (A) Overlay of the 3D electro‐anatomical
  map of the right atrium of case 2 on a schematic drawing of the right heart, seen
  from the left as if all other cardiac structures have been removed. The walls of
  atria and blood vessels are semi‐transparent to show the dark shaded area which
  represents myocardial tissue from the right atrium and the myocardial sleeves in
  the cranial and caudal vena cava, and the azygos vein. The 3D electro‐anatomical
  map of the right atrium and caudal vena cava is shown in its correct anatomical
  position. Curved white lines represent the clockwise reentry pathway which shows
  a narrow isthmus ventrally. The double white line shows a line of block. (B) Example
  of double potentials, recorded at the line of block in case 2. The yellow line indicates
  the automatically annotated time of activation. The green line indicates the reference
  point for the mapping system, in this case the tip electrode pair of the coronary
  sinus catheter. The time in between is 130 ms, the scale is 0.05 mV. (C) On the
  right, the 3D electro‐anatomical map of case 6 shows a clockwise macro‐reentry circuit
  with a narrow ventral isthmus. At each number along the entire circuit, the corresponding
  electrogram is displayed on the left. The complete cycle length of the tachycardia
  could be found on the macro‐reentry pathway. (D) Surface ECG lead II (upper white
  trace) and electrograms from the coronary sinus (CS) catheter (yellow traces) of
  case 6 are shown with CS 1‐2 as the most distal electrodes (deep in the CS). Electrode
  10 was outside the coronary sinus. The earliest deflection on the coronary sinus
  catheter is on electrode pair CS 8‐9, suggesting that the initial depolarization
  of the atrial tachycardia is originating from the right atrium
