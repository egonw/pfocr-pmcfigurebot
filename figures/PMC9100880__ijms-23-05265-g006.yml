caption: Hedgehog pathway is downregulated in Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia; (A–C)
  RT-qPCR on tissue from patients presenting with Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia
  (CDH) and controls for SHH (A), PTCH1 (B), and HHIP (C) (results show mean ± SEM,
  * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; n = 4 for CTL and n = 3 for CDH). Combinatorial FISH with
  IF for either PTCH1 (green, (D,E)) or HHIP (green, (G,H)) with SHH (red) and CDH1
  (IF-white) performed on tissue sections from CDH (E,H) and control (D,G) patients;
  dot plot quantification (F,I,J) of the FISH signal in CDH vs. control sections (results
  show mean ± SEM, * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; n = 3 for CTL and n = 3 for CDH).
