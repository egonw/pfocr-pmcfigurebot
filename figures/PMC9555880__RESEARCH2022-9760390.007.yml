caption: 'mTOR signaling pathway is vital for MTP maintenance. (a) Differentiation
  trajectories of MTP show key signaling pathways and TFs involved in the differentiation.
  (b) TFs that positively regulate key stem cell, MTP, muscle, and tendon markers.
  TFs on the left can regulate more than one marker, and marker-specific TFs are shown
  on the right. TFs and their targets are linked by lines. (c) GESA analysis: the
  function of mTOR signaling pathway in the differentiation process of clusters. (d)
  Immunofluorescence staining for COL14 and ASB5 of MTP and rapamycin treated MTP.
  Scale bars: 50 μm. (e) H&E staining for WT and mTOR-ko mice. Scale bars: 50 μm.
  Yellow arrows represent MTP. (f) Immunofluorescence staining for Scx and Dys of
  MTP in normal mice and in mTOR-ko mice. Scale bars: 50 μm. Yellow arrows represent
  MTP. (g) Histogram of the number of nuclei in MTP (p < 0.05).'
