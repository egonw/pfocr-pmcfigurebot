caption: Effects of CRS on gut microbial metabolites, comparing CRS-exposed and control
  mice. A Plot of principal component analysis (PCA) showing the closeness of each
  sample in CRS or control mice to PC1 and PC2, each representing a unique set of
  metabolites. The closer the distance between data points, the higher the similarity
  between samples. B Results from Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA)
  in which Welch's difference test was used and the PLS-DA confidence was 0.95. Comp1
  and Comp2 are the two main principal components; C Expression profiles and variable
  importance in the projection (VIP values) of the metabolites with differential abundance
  between the CRS and control groups ( VIPâ‰¥1 and FDR-adjusted P<0.05). The left panel
  represents relative abundance of the metabolite, whereas the right panel shows VIP
  values for the metabolite and statistical difference between the mouse groups (***
  adjusted P<0.001, **P<0.01, and *P<0.05); D Enrichment ratios specific to metabolic
  pathways derived from KEGG enrichment analysis, in which enrichment ratio is defined
  as the number of the metabolites enriched in the pathway divided by the background
  number of the metabolites annotated to the pathway. P values are FDR adjusted and
  for differences in pathway enrichment between the CRS and control groups, based
  on Wilcoxon rank-sum test (* denotes P<0.05).
