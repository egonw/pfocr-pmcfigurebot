figure_title: Prolactin signaling pathway
caption: a Prolactin signaling pathway map. A node (or object) on the map could be
  a gene, protein or chemical compound. Query genes from experimental data which intersect
  with pathway protein or chemical compound. Query genes from experimental data which
  intersect with pathway objects are denoted by thermometers. Thermometer 1 represents
  causal transcription factors. Thermometer 2 represents DEGs in response to treatment
  with vaccine, applying thresholds of log2FC ≥ 2.00 or ≤ −2.00, and FDR ≤ 0.05. b
  Biological processes involved in prolactin signaling pathway. The % refers to the
  percentage of network objects in the pathway map. The p-value is the process prediction
  p-value.
