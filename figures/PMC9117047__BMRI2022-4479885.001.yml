caption: 'JDHY can improve liver damage in ALF rats. (a–d) Biochemical tests were
  applied to check changes in indicators of liver function (AST, ALT, ALP, and TBiL)
  in serum of each group. In the ALF group (n = 10), the level of ALT, AST, ALP, and
  TBiL was higher compared with that in the control group (n = 6), while the level
  of AST, ALT, ALP, and TBiL was upregulated significantly in the ALF+JDHY group (n
  = 10) and ALF+BAY group (n = 10). (e, f) Biochemical tests were used to measure
  the prothrombin activity (PTA) of rats and the count of platelet (PLT). (g) Histopathological
  damage to the rat liver was checked by H&E staining. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. control group
  (n = 6), ##P < 0.01 vs. ALF group (n = 10). BAY: NF-κB inhibitor.'
