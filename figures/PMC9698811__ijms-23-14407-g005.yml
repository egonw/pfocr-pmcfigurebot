caption: A working model of the regulatory roles of Ciona-NFAT5 and SLC26A6 on ascidian
  notochord lumen expansion. (A) The schematic diagram depicts that NFAT5 responds
  to hyperosmotic stress and regulates notochord lumen expansion via the SLC26A6 pathway.
  (B) Loss of NFAT5 function in notochord cells by CRISPR/Cas9 suppressed the expression
  of the downstream, genes including SLC26A6, and led to the defects of lumen expansion.
  (C) Loss of transport activity mutant of SLC26A6 phenocopied the similar lumen expansion
  defects with NFAT5knockout.
