caption: Subnetworks of DBN transition structures discovered for the GSE37182 dataset.
  Structures of time-varying DBN models without intra-edges were learned independently
  for normal and tumor subgroups. The blue edges denote the edges which are specific
  to the normal model; red edges are specific to the tumor model. Black edges are
  present in both models. The solid lines correspond to edges between genes which
  were found as interactors in the STRING database. Genes from the colorectal cancer
  pathway (KEGG) are highlighted in orange. (A) Most differently connected genes (FOSB,
  JUN, FOS, GADD45B) in DBN transition structures of cancer and normal DBN models
  that are either enriched in the colorectal cancer signaling pathway or were previously
  validated as biomarkers of cancer and their parents in the learned DBN models. (B)
  Most similarly connected genes, which were also found on the generic transcription
  pathway [] (highlighted in green).
