figure_title: Preventative treatment with ST1072 reduces GVHD in NSG xenograft mouse
  model
caption: NSG-A2+ mice were irradiated (250 cGy) and were transplanted with HLA-A2–
  human PBMCs (10×106). The recipient mice were injected i.p. with vehicle or with
  ST1072 at 1mg/kg daily from day −1 to day 14. The recipients were monitored for
  body weight and survival (A) until 60 days post transplantation. Data shown here
  are pooled from two combined experiments (n=13–14 per group). In a separate experiment,
  Raji B cell lymphoma (1×106) were infused together with or without HLA-A2– human
  PBMCs (10×106) into NSG-A2+ mice, which were treated with vehicle alone or with
  ST1072. The mice were monitored for clinical score, survival and tumor burden (B)
  until 50 days post transplantation. Data shown here are from two combined experiments
  (n=13–14/group). For comparison of recipient survival among groups, the log-rank
  test was used to determine statistical significance. Clinical scores were compared
  using a nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. Asterisks indicate statistical significance
  *p < 0.05, *p < 0.01.
