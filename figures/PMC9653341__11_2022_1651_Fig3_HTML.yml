caption: Polarization of macrophages and its molecular mechanism. The migratory macrophages
  and resident macrophages are activated and differentiated into macrophages with
  different functions in IRI region under the influence of different molecules. Interferon
  (IFN)-γ or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can polarize macrophages into M1 which produces
  inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1,
  IL-6 and reactive oxygen species (ROS) through c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), Notch,
  Janus kinase signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT), and
  NF-κB signaling pathways. IL-4 or IL-13 activates M2 mainly through phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathway, and M2 generates immune molecules
  such as IL-10, chemoattractant cytokine ligand (CCL)22 and CCL17 to repair the damage
