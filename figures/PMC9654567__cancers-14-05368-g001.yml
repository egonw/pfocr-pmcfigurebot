caption: 'High expression of SUN5 was detected in colorectal cancer tissues and cells.
  (A) SUN5 protein levels in colorectal carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung
  carcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, and gastric carcinoma (measured by Western blotting,
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01). (B) The expression of SUN5 in 203 CRC tissues and 160
  adjacent tissues according to GSE87211 cohort (**** p < 0.0001. Student’s t-test).
  (C) SUN5 protein levels in CRC tissues compared with those in adjacent tissues (n
  = 40, measured by Western blotting, ** p < 0.01). (D) Western blotting results of
  protein levels of SUN5 in colorectal cancer tissues and adjacent tissues in 14 cases;
  the “C” represents CRC tissues, and the “N” represents adjacent tissues. (E) Representative
  IHC images of SUN5 in human CRC tissues (right) and adjacent tissues (left). Scale
  bar: 30 μm. (F) Immunofluorescence staining results showed that SUN5 was mainly
  distributed in the nucleus membrane and perinuclear cytoplasm in DLD-1 cells. Scale
  bar: 20 μm. (G) SUN5 protein levels in CRC cell lines (SW480, HT29, LoVo, RKO, SW620,
  HCT116, and DLD-1) were analyzed by Western blotting.'
