caption: 'The IκBα/NF-κB pathway and inflammatory cytokines are regulated by NOB.
  (A) Protein expressions of IκBα and phosphorylation of p65 in 3T3-L1 at 8 days after
  differentiation. The right panel shows the quantification result. One-way ANOVA
  with Tukey’s multiple comparison test (***, p < 0.001; ****, p < 0.0001). (B) Real-time
  qPCR analysis of lipogenesis-related gene expressions in 3T3-L1 at 8 days after
  differentiation. Data are shown as mean ± SEM every 4 h for 24 h (n = 3/group/time
  point). Two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison tests showed significant
  differences # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, ### p < 0.001, ##### p < 0.0001, DMSO vs. NOB10;
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001, DMSO vs. NOB20; † p < 0.05,
  †† p < 0.01 NOB10 vs. NOB20. (C) TNFα level from media was measured by using ELISA.
  One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test (***, p < 0.001; ****, p < 0.0001).'
