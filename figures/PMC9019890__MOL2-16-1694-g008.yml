caption: 'UBE2T enhances the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. (A) Western blot analysis
  for the detection of protein levels of the upstream effectors of the MAPK/ERK pathway.
  (B) Quantification of the ratio of proteins: p‐RAF‐1 (S259)/RAF‐1, p‐RAF‐1(S338)/RAF‐1,
  p‐RAF‐1(S621)/RAF‐1 from (A). (C) Western blot analysis for the detection of protein
  levels of the downstream effectors of the MAPK/ERK pathway. (D) Quantification of
  the ratio of proteins: p‐MEK/MEK and p‐ERK/ERK from (C). Data shown are the mean ± SEM
  from n = 4 independent experiments, two‐tailed Student''s t‐test (*P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01,
  ***P ≤ 0.001, ****P ≤ 0.0001). Empty vector (EV)‐transfected cells were used as
  control for UBE2T ectopic overexpression (UBE2T), while nontargeting siRNA (SCRAMBLE)
  as control for UBE2T silencing (si‐UBE2T#1, si‐UBE2T#2). Untransfected cells (UN)
  were used as negative control. Normalization in western blot was performed to GAPDH.'
