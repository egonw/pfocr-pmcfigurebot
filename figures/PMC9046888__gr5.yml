caption: Eriodictyol treatment induces differential expression of distinct gene sets
  implicated in apoptosis, metastasis, cell-cycle regulatory genes, and associated
  pathways in HeLa cells. A. A heat map showing differential regulation of global
  genes in response to Eriodictyol treatment in both 6 h (E6_1, E6_2) and 24 h (E24_1,
  E24_2) in comparison to untreated control (C_1, C_2). B. Volcano plot depicting
  the differentially regulated global genes at 6 h post treatment of Eriodictyol.
  C. Venn diagram analysis exhibiting total number of apoptosis, metastasis and cell
  cycle regulatory genes at 6 h Eriodictyol treatment. D. Heat map displaying a screened
  set of genes highly affected by Eriodictyol at 6 h through IPA analysis. E. Functional
  analysis represented as bar plot C vs E6. F. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The color
  intensity of the nodes shows the degree of enrichment of this analysis. The enrich-factor
  is defined as the ratio of the differential genes in the entire genome. The dot
  size represents the count of genes in a pathway. C_1- Untreated sample 1, C_2- Untreated
  sample 2, E6_1 - Treated sample 6 h sample 1, E6_2 - Treated sample 6 h sample 2,
  E24_1 - Treated sample 24 h sample 1, E24_2 - Treated sample 24 h sample 2.
