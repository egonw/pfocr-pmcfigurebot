caption: NMT1 modulated GC cell migration and invasion. (a) Migration rate of AGS
  cells at 48 h was evaluated through wound healing assay after transfection of NMT1
  overexpression plasmid. (b) Migration rate of SNU-5 cells at 48 h was evaluated
  through wound healing assay after transfection of shNMT1. (c) Invasion rate of AGS
  cells at 48 h was determined by transwell assay after transfection of NMT1 overexpression
  plasmid. (d) Invasion rate of SNU-5 cells at 48 h was determined by Transwell assay
  after transfection of shNMT1. ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001 vs. NC group; ∧∧p < 0.01,
  ∧∧∧p < 0.001 vs. shNC group. All experiments were repeated independently at least
  three times. Data were performed as the means ± standard deviation. NMT1, N-myristoyltransferase
  1; GC, gastric cancer; shNMT1, short hairpin RNA against NMT1; NC, negative control.
