caption: Tumorigenic capacity of breast CSCs is enhanced by HOTAIR overexpression.A,
  HOTAIR overexpressing breast tumor cells were established. Data are shown as means ±
  SD. B, ALDH1+ (CSC) subpopulations were detected in HOTAIR overexpressed cells by
  FACS analysis. Results are shown as means ± SD. C, HOTAIR overexpression causes
  an increased oncosphere-forming capacity in breast cancer stem cells. Cells were
  magnified by 100 folds and the scale bar represented 10 μm. D, different numbers
  of HOTAIR-overexpressing or control breast CSC of MCF7 were diluted and subcutaneously
  implanted into NOD/SCID nude mice. Tumor-free mice were measured 1 month after injection.
  N = 10 for each group. E, different numbers of HOTAIR-overexpressing or control
  breast CSC of MDA-MB-453 were diluted and subcutaneously implanted into NOD/SCID
  nude mice. Tumor-free mice were measured 1 month after injection. N = 10 for each
  group. F, HOTAIR overexpressing or control breast CSC of MCF7 were diluted and subcutaneously
  implanted into NOD/SCID nude mice. Tumors were observed over 1 month. N = 10 for
  each group. G, HOTAIR overexpressing or control breast CSC of MDA-MB-453 were diluted
  and subcutaneously implanted into NOD/SCID nude mice. Tumors were observed over
  1 month. N = 10 for each group. H, overexpression of HOTAIR resulted in elevated
  expression of pluripotent factors in breast cells as assessed by quantitative real-time
  PCR. Data are shown as means ± SD. I, the expression of pluripotent factors were
  determined by Western blot after HOTAIR overexpression. β-actin was used as a control.
  CSC, cancer stem cell; HOTAIR, Hox transcript antisense intergenic RNA (∗ indicates
  p < 0.05; ∗∗ indicates p < 0.01.).
