caption: Deletion of MEN1 results in G2/M arrest and JNK signalling pathway activation.
  (A) Cell cycle analysis by propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry in
  the shLuc‐ and shMEN1‐HK‐2 cells after 5‐μg/ml aristolochic acid (AA) treatment.
  (B) Cell cycle analysis by PI staining in the MEN1‐WT and MEN1‐KO cells treated
  with 5‐μg/ml AA for 24 h. (C) Immunofluorescence (IF) staining for phosphorylated
  histone H3 (p‐H3) (red) and DAPI (blue) in the siNC‐ and siMEN1‐HK‐2 cells treated
  with 5‐μg/ml AA for 24 h; scale bars 40 μm. (D) Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining
  for p‐H3 and Ki67 in the kidney tissues of the Men1 f/f and Men1Δ/Δ mice at 12 months;
  scale bars 50 μm. (E) Quantification of p‐H3 and Ki67 IHC staining in (D) (n = 9
  mice per group at 8 months, n = 9 mice in the Men1 f/f and n = 14 mice in the Men1Δ/Δ
  groups). (F) Cell cycle distribution in primary mouse renal tubular epithelial cells
  (mRTECs) at the indicated time points after 10‐μM MI‐3 or 10‐ng/ml TGF‐β alone or
  combined treatment. (G) Quantitative real‐time PCR (qPCR) was used to detect the
  mRNA expression of the indicated genes in the MEN1‐WT and MEN1‐KO HK‐2 cells after
  5‐μg/ml AA treatment. (H) Enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were used
  to measure the 10‐ng/ml TGF‐β1 concentration in the supernatant of the MEN1‐WT and
  MEN1‐KO HK‐2 cells treated with 5‐μg/ml AA for 48 h. (I) ELISA were used to measure
  the content of collagen 1α in the serum of the Men1 f/f and Men1Δ/Δ mice (n = 9
  mice per group at 8 months, n = 9 mice in the Men1 f/f and n = 14 mice in the Men1Δ/Δ
  groups at 12 months). (J) Quantification of EdU‐positive cells in Figure  (n = 10
  images per group). (K) Proliferation of fibroblasts incubated with conditioned medium
  (CM) from the MEN1‐WT and MEN1‐KO HK‐2 cells treated with 5‐μg/ml AA (three biological
  replicates). (L) Proliferation of primary mRTECs was determined by using trypan
  blue exclusion assay after 10‐μM MI‐3 or 10‐ng/ml TGF‐β alone or combined treatment
  (three biological replicates); the data are represented as mean ± standard deviation
  (SD) (one‐way ANOVA). (M) Western blotting was used to detect the expression of
  the indicated proteins in the shLuc‐ and shMEN1‐HK‐2 cells treated with 5‐μg/ml
  AA for 48 h. (N) Western blotting was used to detect the expression of the indicated
  proteins in the MEN1‐WT and MEN1‐KO HK‐2 cells treated with 5‐μg/ml AA for 48 h.
  (O) A schematic that summarizes the flow of signals from initial kidney damage to
  the suppression of menin/MLL1 expression, the expression of hepatocyte growth factor
  (HGF)‐Adamts5 and the activation of multiple signalling pathways involved in kidney
  fibrosis. The data are represented as mean ± SD; *p < .05, **p < .01, ***p < .001,
  ****p < .0001.
