caption: Correlation of RP11-273G15.2 expression in B cells with IFN scores and disease
  activity. (A) The expression level of RP11-273G15.2 in B cells of healthy controls
  (HCs) and SLE patients. Mann-Whitney test was used. (B) ROC curve of RP11-273G15.2
  level in discriminating SLE from HC. (C–D) The expression level of RP11-273G15.2
  in SLE patients’ B cell was positively correlated with (C) IFN scores and (D) SLEDAI
  scores. (E) ROC curve of RP11-273G15.2 expression level and IFN score in separating
  SLE patients with SLEDAI-2K scores<6 from those with SLEDAI-2K scores≥6. Spearman’s
  method was used for correlation analysis. *p<0.05; **p<0.01; ***p<0.001; ****p<0.0001.
  AUC, area under the curve; IFN, interferon; ROC, receiver operating characteristic;
  SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus; SLEDAI, SLE Disease Activity Index.
