caption: 'Small GTP proteins undergoing prenylation showed dynamic expression patterns
  among oocytes maturation.A, schematic diagram of cholesterol de novo synthesis pathway.
  The blue rectangles represent the metabolic enzymes. Endogenous cholesterol is synthesized
  from acetyl-CoA, derived from glucose, glutamine, and/or acetate metabolism. MVA
  pathway provides substrates to produce sterols and isoprenoid metabolites that are
  essential for a variety of biological processes. B, heatmap showing the dynamics
  of genes of cholesterol de novo synthesis pathway and protein prenylation from GO
  to MII oocytes in 6-week-old mice. GO: growing oocytes (n = 4). FGO: fully growing
  oocytes (n = 3). MII: MII-arrested oocytes (n = 3). Three stages are displayed in
  green, blue, and pink. C–K, violin plots showing the expression levels (Log2[FPKM+1])
  of genes in cholesterol de novo synthesis pathway and protein prenylation in mouse
  oocytes at different stages (n = 3–4, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01).
  L, heatmap showing the dynamics of genes coding small GTP proteins from GO to MII
  oocytes in mice (n = 3–4). ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, compared with the GO by Student’s
  t test. #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, compared with the FGO by Student’s t test. The data
  represent the mean ± SEM. See also . MVA, mevalonate.'
