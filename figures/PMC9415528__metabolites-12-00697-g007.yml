caption: AMPK signaling was dysregulated under hypothermia based on transcriptomic
  analysis. (A) heatmap; (B) transcriptional expression of key genes in AMPK signaling
  pathway retrieved from the transcriptome. Data were analyzed by Student’s t-test
  with SPSS 23.0, asterisk represents the statistical difference (*, p < 0.05; **,
  p < 0.01). Results were expressed as mean ± SEM, n = 3.
