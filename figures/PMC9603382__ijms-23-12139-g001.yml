caption: The potential pathogenesis of PWSs. GNAQ (R183Q) mutations activate classic
  MAPK, PKC/NF-ÎºB/ANGPT2, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. Meanwhile, overexpression of
  VEGF-A and VEGFR2 activates PI3K/AKT/mTOR, p38-MAPK/mTOR, and classic MAPK signaling
  pathways. Furthermore, the coexpression of EphB1/EfnB2 activates the classic MAPK
  pathway. Activating these signaling pathways could influence the proliferation,
  migration, permeability, and survival of cells, thereby promoting angiogenesis and
  the dilation of vessels.
