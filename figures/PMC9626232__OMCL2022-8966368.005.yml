caption: TF3 induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in OS cell lines. OS cells were treated
  with 0.05% DMSO (vehicle control) or the indicated concentrations (0, 40, 80, 120,
  or 160 μM) of TF3 for 24 h. (a, b) Cell cycle analyses of MG-63 and HOS cells via
  flow cytometry and quantitative analyses of the cell cycle distributions. The data
  are presented as the mean ± SD (n = 3). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, and
  ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001 vs. the vehicle control group.
