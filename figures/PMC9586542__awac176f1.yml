caption: Serum lipid profiles discriminate Parkinson’s disease patients from controls
  in a multi-ethnic cohort. Using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) on identified
  principal components, three canonical functions were generated that could significantly
  discriminate the groups. (A) A scatterplot of the first two functions clearly showed
  separation between the control and Parkinson’s disease groups and between the LRRK2
  mutation and non-mutation Parkinson’s disease groups. (B) A scatterplot of the first
  and third functions shows separation of all four groups. (C) To determine which
  lipids may contribute to the discrimination of Parkinson’s disease patients from
  controls independent of LRRK2 G2019S mutation, LDA using identified principal components
  was performed and the results indicated control (controls plus LRRK2 carriers without
  Parkinson’s disease) and Parkinson’s disease (LRRK2 and non-LRRK2 Parkinson’s disease)
  groups were distinguishable. Multivariate analysis of variance covarying for age
  and sex identified four principal components, (C) PC8, (D) PC9, (E) PC20 and (F)
  PC35. (G–J) The top 20 lipid species that contributed to the four principal components
  discriminating Parkinson’s disease from controls. The dashed red line represents
  the expected value if the contribution of lipids were uniform. n = 221.
