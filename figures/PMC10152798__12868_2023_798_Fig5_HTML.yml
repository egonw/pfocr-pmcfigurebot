caption: Noncanonical Wnt signaling for neuronal differentiation with HDAC inhibitors.
  HDAC inhibitors activate Wnt4, Wnt5α, Wnt 11, and the Fzd receptor. Fzd activates
  Dvl and stimulates the Wnt/Ca2+ or Wnt/JNK pathway. In the Wnt/Ca2+pathway, activated
  Dvl promotes Ca2+, which stimulates PKC. In the Wnt/JNK pathway, activated Dvl promotes
  phosphorylated ERK and phosphorylated JNK. Finally, c-Jun, a transcription factor,
  binds to DNA and promotes neuronal differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that Wnt4/5α/11
  can modulate Dvl/PKC signaling and the Dvl/p-ERK/p-JNK pathway for neuronal differentiation
  following HDAC inhibition. Orange color indicates the signaling observed in this
  study
