caption: Pathway analysis of serum metabolomics between the CWP case and control groups.
  CWP-related metabolic pathways were shown in the pathway bubble plot, which was
  mapped by the combination of pathway enrichment analysis (p value of Y-axis) and
  pathway topology analysis (pathway impact of X-axis). Only the metabolic pathway
  of phenylalanine metabolism was enriched, but its pathway impact equaled 0.
