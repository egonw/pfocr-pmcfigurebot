caption: Scatter plots represent the relationship between the risk score and other
  indices. (a) The stemness index is a value to measure oncogenic dedifferentiation.
  The risk score showed a strong positive correlation with the mRNA stemness index
  (). (b) SAS is a score to measure the degree of activity of a subsystem (e.g., pathway).
  The risk score showed a strong positive correlation with one carbon pool by folate
  pathway (hsa00670) (). (c) The risk score showed a strong negative correlation with
  nitrogen metabolism (hsa00910) (). r indicates Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient,
  and p-values are the results of two-tailed correlation tests.
