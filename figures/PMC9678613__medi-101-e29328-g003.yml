caption: Effect of baicalin treatment on the invasion of MDA-MB231 cells. MDA-MB-231
  cells were treated with 0, 12.5, 25, or 50 μM of baicalin for 24 h. Cells were suspended
  and reseeded into a Transwell chamber precoated with matrigel for 16 h. The invaded
  cells were stained with 0.01% crystal violet. (A) The cells were observed with an
  inverted microscope (× 100 magnifications) and images of the same were captured.
  (B) The numbers of invaded cells were counted. The cell viability of untreated cells
  was set as 100%. Results are presented as mean ± standard deviation, *P < .05 vs
  untreated cells.
