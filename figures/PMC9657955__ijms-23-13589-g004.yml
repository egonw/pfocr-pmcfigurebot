caption: MapMan ontology-derived pictorial overview of expression profiles for differentially
  expressed genes in Musa acuminata var. Calcutta 4, 3 days after inoculation with
  Pseudocercospora musae. Differential expression data based on log2FC of transcripts
  from inoculated plant tissues versus non-inoculated controls are presented across
  selected pathways, with each point representing a paralog gene encoding a specific
  enzyme within the metabolic pathway. A red color indicates an up-regulated gene
  in infected Musa leaf tissue versus non-inoculated controls, whereas a blue color
  indicates down-regulation.
