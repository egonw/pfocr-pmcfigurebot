caption: Inhibition of the cGAS-STING pathway ameliorates podocyte injury in db/db
  mice(A) FBG levels of C176 or vehicle DMSO-treated mice at 10 weeks old after treatment
  for 3 weeks (db/db + C176, n = 6; db/db + DMSO, n = 3, db/m + C176, n = 5, db/m +
  DMSO, n = 5).(B) The proteinuria (PRO).(C and D) H&E staining (scale bars, 20μm),
  IHC staining of nephrin (scale bars, 10μm), TEM (scale bars, 0.6μm) and TUNEL staining
  (scale bars, 10μm) of kidney tissue in C176 or vehicle DMSO-treated mice (db/db +
  C176, n = 6; db/db + DMSO, n = 3, db/m + C176, n = 5, db/m + DMSO, n = 5).(E and
  F) Western blot analysis of cGAS, STING, P-TBK1/TBK1, P-IRF3/IRF3 and IFNβ in kidney
  cortical tissue at 10 weeks old after C176 or vehicle DMSO treatment for 3 weeks
  (db/db + C176, n = 6; db/db + DMSO, n = 3, db/m + C176, n = 5, db/m + DMSO, n =
  5). Data are mean ± SEM ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001 with two-way ANOVA followed
  by Sidak post hoc test (B) and Kruskal-Wallis test (A, D, F). See also .
