caption: ERp44/PERK affected ERS and apoptosis in HK2. (A-a) Binding sites of miR-142-3p
  and ERp44; (A-b) the expression of ERp44 affects survival outcomes of RCC patients;
  (A-c) verification of the binding of ERp44 and miR-142-3p by dual luciferase reporter
  gene detection; (B) WB results of HK2 cells with ERp44 overexpression or miR-142-3p
  inhibitor. Overexpression of ERp44 could reduce the expression of apoptosis and
  ERS in HK2 cells cultured with RCSC-sEVs; (D) TUNEL result showed that overexpression
  of ERp44 would reduce RCSC-sEVs intervened HK2 apoptosis; (C) knockdown of ERp44
  in HK2 cells cultured with RCSC-sEVs led to enhanced expression of PERK, GRP78,
  ATF4 and CHOP, which were involved in ERS PERK-CHOP pathway; (E) the TUNEL result
  showed that PERK was involved in the ERp44 knockdown HK2 apoptosis (TUNEL staining,
  ×200 magnification, scale bars =200 µm. The apoptotic cells were stained red, whereas
  the nuclei were stained blue). n=3; **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001; nc, negative control;
  oe, over expression; in, inhibitor; kd, knock down; ERS, endoplasmic reticulum stress;
  HK2, human kidney 2; RCSCs, renal cancer stem cells; sEVs, small extracellular vesicles;
  WS, Western blot.
