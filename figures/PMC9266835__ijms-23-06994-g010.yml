caption: KEGG pathway gene set enrichment analysis for the ranked genes. Size of dots
  represents the GeneRatio while the color represents the p value. (A) Proteosome,
  DNA replication, oxidative phosphorylation and base excision repair pathways were
  significantly activated in the high-risk group as compared to the low-risk group.
  (B) Immunity pathways such as Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, JAK-STAT signaling
  pathway and Th17 cell differentiation were suppressed in the high-risk group as
  compared to the low-risk group.
