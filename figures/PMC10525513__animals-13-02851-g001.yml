caption: Molecular validation of spontaneous cystic follicle samples. Relative messenger
  RNA abundance was measured by real-time qPCR and normalized to the geometric mean
  of three housekeeping genes H2AFZ, GAPDH and RLP19. Granulosa (A) and theca cells
  (B) were isolated from ovarian follicular cysts (structures of at least 20 mm in
  diameter; Cyst group) and from non-cystic large follicles (≥12 mm; Control group).
  Data represent the mean ± SEM from granulosa (n = 10) and theca cells (n = 4) independent
  follicle samples per group. An asterisk (*) indicates significant difference between
  groups (p < 0.05).
