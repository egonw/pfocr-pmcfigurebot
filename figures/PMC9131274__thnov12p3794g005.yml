caption: Stress affects the epigenetic signature and gene expression changes in mice
  breast tumors. (A) Distribution of the methylation rate of mCpG sites on the whole
  genome. (B) Summary of DMR-related gene (DMG) results. Volcano plot representation
  of DMGs in the S and NS tumor samples. The X-axis shows Log2fold-changes in methylation
  level, and the y-axis is the -Log 10 p-value of a DMG. (C) The top 10 DMGs for mC
  count. (D) GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of DMGs in the S tumor samples. Biological
  processes (BP), cellular components (CC), and molecular function (MF) (E) Venn diagram
  showing the co-expression and up/down-regulation of genes in NS and S tumor samples
  (top). Volcano plot of RNA-seq transcriptome data displaying significantly differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) from tumor samples with or without stress (bottom). Significant
  DEGs (FDR-corrected P ≤ 0.05) are highlighted in blue, with the grey lines representing
  the boundary for identification of up- or down-regulated genes (Log2 FC>1). Selected
  top high-expression genes related to stress response are indicated. (F, G) KEGG
  pathway analysis of up- and down-regulated DEGs significantly enriched in functional
  categories (P ≤ 0.05). The gene ratio is the ratio of the DEG number and the number
  of all genes in a certain enrichment pathway. The dot size denotes the number of
  DEGs, while colors correspond to the adjusted p-value range. All transcriptome experiments
  were performed in biological triplicate. One-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) were
  used to determine the inter-group differences between two groups for one or two
  variables (***p < 0.001).
