caption: 'ML385 reversed the effects of oxycodone on cell viability, cell apoptosis,
  and inflammatory response in mifepristone‐treated human endometrial stromal cells
  (hEndoSCs). hEndoSCs were exposed to mifepristone for 48 h, and then treated with
  oxycodone (10 μg/mL) and/or a Keap1/Nrf2/HO‐1 inhibitor (5 μM ML385) for 24 h. Cells
  were divided into four groups: mifepristone, mifepristone +  oxycodone‐10, mifepristone + oxycodone‐10 + DMSO,
  or mifepristone + oxycodone‐10 + ML385. (A) hEndoSC viability was evaluated using
  the MTT assay. (B) hEndoSC apoptosis was evaluated using flow cytometry. (C) Quantification
  of apoptotic cells. (D) Determination of Caspase3 activity. (E) Western blot analysis
  of cleaved‐Caspase3. (F) Quantification of cleaved‐Caspase3 expression. The enzyme‐linked
  immunosorbent assay was applied to assess tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), interleukin‐β
  (IL‐β), and IL‐6 (G–I) expression in the different groups. N = 3. **p < .01 versus
  mifepristone; ##p < .01 versus the mifepristone + oxycodone‐10 + DMSO group. Experiments
  were repeated three times, and the data were presented as means ± SD.'
