caption: Functional enrichment analysis of ANO10 in BC. A. Heatmap of differentially
  expressed genes between the low and high ANO10 expression groups. B, C. GO term
  enrichment analysis of DEG stratification by ANO10 expression. D. KEGG term enrichment
  analysis of DEG stratification by ANO10 expression. E. GSEA of ANO10-mediated biological
  processes in the HALLMARK signature. F. GSEA of ANO10-mediated biological processes
  in the KEGG signature. The curves with different colors indicate the different pathway
  annotations.
