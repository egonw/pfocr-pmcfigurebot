caption: 'FAM201A sponged miR-1271-5p to increase the expression of FLOT1, a direct
  target of miR-1271-5p, in CC cells. (a) The targeting relationship between miR-1271-5p
  and LINC01106 was identified by Targetscan. (b, c) FLOT1 was confirmed as the target
  of LINC01106 by dual-luciferase reporter assay. (d-g) The expression of FLOT1 in
  CC (SiHa and ME180) cells after transfection with FAM201A overexpression plasmids
  or miR-1271-5p mimic alone or in combination was analyzed by qRT-PCR (f, g) and
  western blot (d, e), with GAPDH as the reference gene. +P < 0.05; ++P or ##P < 0.01;
  +++P or ^^^P or ###P < 0.001; + vs. NC+MC; ^ vs. FAM201A+MC; # vs. NC+miR-1271-5p
