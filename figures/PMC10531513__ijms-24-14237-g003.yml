caption: 'Expression analysis and functional prediction of differential mRNAs in the
  liver. (A) Volcano diagrams of mRNA. The abscissa and ordinate represent X = log2
  (fold changes) and Y = âˆ’log10 (p-value), the red dots indicate upregulated differential
  genes, the blue dots indicate downregulated differential genes, and the gray dots
  represent genes with no significant difference. (B) The clustering heatmaps of the
  highest differentially expressed genes. Nor: Normal raccoon dog, Dis: Diseased raccoon
  dog. (C) GO analysis on the function of differential genes. (D) KEGG analysis of
  the top 20 signaling pathways enriched with differential genes. (E) Construction
  of an interplay network of PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, Tight junction, AMPK signaling
  pathway, and related genes aimed at obtaining key genes, and the results revealed
  that IGF1R, CREB3L1, TNS1, TENC1, and mTOR could participate in the three signaling
  pathways simultaneously.'
