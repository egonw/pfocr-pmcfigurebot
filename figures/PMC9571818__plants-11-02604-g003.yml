caption: Signal transduction pathway of SLs and protein interaction. (A) Degradation
  of D14 into ABC-FTL and HMB. The figure also shows the open (inactive) and closed
  (active) conformation of D14 with the “D” ring. (B) Interaction of D14 (DWARF 14)
  with F-box protein D3 and a repressor D53 mediating the signaling pathway. In the
  absence of SLs, D53 arrests SLs transduction, however, SLs repressor is degraded
  through controlled ubiquitination followed by SLs release and successful transduction.
  SLs (Strigolactones); D14 (DWARF 14); ABC-FTL (ABC formlytricyclic lactone); HMB
  (Hydroxymethylbutenolide); D3 (DWARF 3); D53 (DWARF 53).
