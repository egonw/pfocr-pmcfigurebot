caption: The nuclear factor‐kappa B (NF‐κB) signalling pathway and pyroptosis were
  activated in myocardial tissues of coronary microembolization (CME) rats. (A) Protein
  levels of NF‐κB p65, NLRP3, DSDMD, and caspase‐1 measured by Western blot analysis.
  (B,C) Expressions of IL‐1β and IL‐18 in myocardial tissues of CME rats assessed
  by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‐qPCR) and immunohistochemistry.
  The data were shown in mean ± standard deviation, n = 6. The t test was used to
  analyse data between two groups. Compared with the sham group, **P < 0.01.
