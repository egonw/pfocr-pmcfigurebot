figure_title: Metabolic pathways for diphenylamine NSAIDs which undergo bioactivation
  to form quinone-species metabolites
caption: 'The diphenylamine structure is metabolically bioactivated through four distinct
  pathways resulting in several quinone-species metabolites. Both pathways 1 and 2
  require monohydroxylation and proceed similarly, where monohydroxylation occurs
  to the acidic phenyl group for pathway 1 resulting in the formation of para-quinone-imine
  which adducts with dansyl glutathione (dGSH), while monohydroxylation occurs on
  the second phenyl ring for pathway 2. Dehalogenation is required for pathway 3 followed
  by subsequent hydroxylation to form an ortho-quinoneimine which is adducted with
  dGSH. Finally, ortho-dihydroxylation is required to result in an ortho-quinone which
  adducts with dGSH. Abbreviations are as follows: ACE, aceclofenac; DIC, diclofenac;
  LUM, lumiracoxib, FLU, flufenamate; MEC, meclofenamate; MEF, mefenamate, TOL; tolfenamate.
