figure_title: AG490 ameliorated UC-MSCs senescence in liver fibrosis factors stimulation
caption: 'A Left panel: Cytochemical evaluation of the senescence marker senescence-associated
  β-galactosidase activity in UC-MSCs treated with LF and AG490 or not. Scale bar:
  50 μm. Right panel: Quantification of SA-β-gal-positive cells in the left panel.
  B Quantification of cellular proliferation detected by CCK8 kit. C Immunoblotting
  analysis of JAK/STAT signaling pathway activation level in control and senescent
  UC-MSCs (with or without treatment of LF and AG490). D QPCR analysis of p16 and
  p21 in UC-MSCs treated with LF and AG490 or not. E Immunoblotting analysis of p16
  and p21 expression in UC-MSCs treated with LF and AG490 or not. F Representative
  images and quantifications of chromatin structure of MSCs shown by Hoechst 33342
  staining of the nucleus. Scale bar, 5 μm. G Gene expressions of SASP marker expressions,
  including IL1A, IL6, CCL2, and TIMP2, in UC-MSCs treated with LF and AG490 or not.
  Data are represented as mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.'
