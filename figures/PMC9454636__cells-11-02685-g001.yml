caption: Comparison of Drosophila and human Toll/TLR and IMD/TNF signalling cascades.
  Basic diagram of Toll signalling in Drosophila versus Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling
  in humans (top). Likewise, simplified diagram of IMD signalling in Drosophila versus
  TNFÎ± receptor and cGAS/STING signalling in humans (bottom). Homologies between fly
  and human signalling proteins are shown through similar colour and shape. A detailed
  description of each pathway and its key proteins is included in the main text. Note
  that not all known signalling proteins and adaptors are included in the diagram
  for the sake of simplicity.
