caption: Enriched KEGG pathways of the main targets of coix seed active compounds.
  The y-axis shows significantly enriched KEGG pathways associated with the target
  genes, and the x-axis shows the rich factor (P < 0.05). The Rich factor indicates
  the ratio of the number of target genes in a specific pathway to the number of all
  annotated genes in that pathway. A higher Rich factor indicates a higher enrichment
  level. The size of the dot indicates the number of target genes in a specific pathway,
  and the color of the dot denotes the different FDR ranges.
