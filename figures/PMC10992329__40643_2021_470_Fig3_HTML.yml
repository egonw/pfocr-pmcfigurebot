caption: 'Engineering shikimate synthesis by biofilm self-assembly. A The schematic
  diagram of shikimate biosynthesis pathway in E. coli S1. B Comparing the color circle
  with starch in different E. coli. C The changes of color circle diameter, enzyme
  index, amylase concentration, and shikimate titer in different E. coli. D Conceptual
  graph of starch utilization with biofilm-based SpyTag/SpyCatcher covalently protein
  system for L-malate production. E Conceptual graph of two modes fermentation for
  shikimate production. F The schematic diagram of BLRS, containing the plasmid Ptac-EL222
  and PJ-mKate. For C, n = 3. Error bars, mean ± s.d. Each gene encodes the following:
  Glu: glucose; G6P: glucose-6-phosphate; PYR: pyruvate; PEP: phosphoenolpyruvate;
  AcCoA: acetyl-CoA; E4P, erythrose-4-phosphate; DAHP, 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate;
  Ru5P, Ribulose 5-phosphate; DHQ, 3-dehydroquinic acid; DHS, 3-dehydroshikimate;
  SA, shikimate'
