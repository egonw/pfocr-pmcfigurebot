caption: UBXN7 inhibits HBV replication in an autophagy-dependent manner. (A) UAS
  domain is required for UBXN7 to inhibit NF-κB signal pathway. HepG2.2.15 cells were
  transfected with FLAG-UBXN7 or FLAG-UBXN7-ΔUAS mutant plasmid. Levels of indicated
  proteins were detected. Note that deletion of UAS domain abolished the ability to
  UBXN7 to reduce NF-κB signaling as reflected by reduction in p-IκBα. (B) UAS domain
  is required for UBXN7 to reduce autophagy. Cells were transfected with GFP-LC3,
  a marker for autophagy, and control or UBXN7 expression plasmid and analyzed by
  confocal microscopy (left). The GFP-LC3 puncta were quantified (right). Note that
  overexpressing UBXN7 decreased autophagy, and deletion of UAS domain abolished this
  ability. (C and D) UAS domain of UBXN7 is required for its ability to inhibit HBV
  RNA and protein levels in HepG2.2.15. Cells were transfected as in (A). The secreted
  HBsAg and HBeAg (C) and HBV RNA (D) were determined. (E) IKK-β–mediated NF-κB signaling
  is critical for the function of HBx to regulate viral transcription by inhibiting
  UBXN7. Huh7 cells were transfected with pHBV1.2, pHBV1.2-Δx, and FLAG-IKK-β plasmids.
  Levels of HBV RNA were detected by Northern blot. (F–H) UAS domain of UBXN7 is required
  for its ability to inhibit HBV RNA and protein levels and to induce autophagy in
  primary human hepatocytes (PHHs). PHH cells were infected with HBV viruses, followed
  by transfection with FLAG-UBXN7 or FLAG-UBXN7-ΔUAS mutant plasmid. Levels of the
  secreted HBsAg (F), HBV pgRNA (G), and autophagy marker LC3 (H) were then determined.
  Note increased level of LC3-II in presence of UBXN7 but not the UAS deletion mutant.
  (I and J) UAS domain of UBXN7 is required for its ability to inhibit expression
  of HBsAg and to induce autophagy in HepG2-NTCP cells. HepG2-NTCP cells were infected
  with HBV viruses, followed by transfection with FLAG-UBXN7 or FLAG-UBXN7-ΔUAS mutant
  plasmid. Levels of secreted HBsAg (I) and autophagy marker LC3 (J) were then determined.
  Note increased level of LC3-II in presence of UBXN7 but not the UAS deletion mutant.
  (Three independent experiments were performed, and representative data are shown.
  ns P ≥ .05, ∗P < .05, ∗∗P < .01, ∗∗∗P < .001 in B–D, F, G, and I).
