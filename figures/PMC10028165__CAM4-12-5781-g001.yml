caption: 'Upregulation of ALDH1L1 inhibited the activation of PI3K/Akt/Rb signaling
  pathway in OSCC cells. (A, B) The mRNA expression levels of JNK, p53, p21, and Bid
  in SCC‐25‐LV‐ALDH1L1, CAL‐27‐sh‐ALDH1L1, and their corresponding control cells were
  examined by qRT‐PCR analysis. (C) The expression levels of p53, p‐p53, p21, JNK,
  p‐JNK, and Bid protein in SCC‐25‐LV‐ALDH1L1, CAL‐27‐sh‐ALDH1L1, and their control
  cells were examined by western blot analysis. (D) Western blot was used to detect
  the expression changes of key regulatory proteins of PI3K/Akt/Rb pathway in the
  four groups of cells SCC‐25‐LV‐Ctrl, SCC‐25‐LV‐ALDH1L1, CAL‐27‐sh‐NC, and CAL‐27‐sh‐ALDH1L1.
  (E) Representative images of IHC staining for PI3K in ALDH1L1 expression low or
  high groups. Scale bar: 50 μm (top) and 100 μm (bottom). (F) Results of IHC staining
  were evaluated by the staining scores. Error bars show mean ± SD. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001.'
