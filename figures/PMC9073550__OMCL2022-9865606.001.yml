caption: Arsenite can activate Nrf2/GPX4 signaling pathway to induce oxidative stress,
  which in turn promotes arsenic-induced liver damage in MIHA cells. The in vitro
  results were based on 6 independent experiments. All data are presented as mean
  ± standard deviation. ∗, P < 0.05. (a) The relative mRNA expression of Nrf2 and
  GPX4. (b) The western blot for Nrf2, p-Nrf2, and GPX4. (c) The relative mRNA expression
  of Nrf2, p-Nrf2, and GPX4. (d) The concentration of oxidative stress-related indicators.
  (e) The content of liver damage-related indicators.
