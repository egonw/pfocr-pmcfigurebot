caption: BDX-01 alleviates colitis by regulating the FXR/NLRP3 inflammasome signaling
  pathways in intestinal mucosal barriers by modulating the gut microbiota and bile
  acids. (A) During colitis progression, an imbalance in the gut microbiota leads
  to the invasion of pathogenic bacteria, such as Proteobacteria, intestinal barrier
  damage, macrophage infiltration, activation of intestinal epithelial cells and the
  macrophage inflammasome signaling pathway, and proinflammatory cytokine production.
  Reduction in intestinal BSH-producing bacteria alters BA unconjugation and lowers
  the unconjugated/conjugated primary BA ratios. Increases in conjugated BA, such
  as TÎ²MCA, inhibit the farsenoid X receptor (FXR). FXR in intestinal epithelial cells
  and macrophages is inhibited in a BA-dependent manner, texacerbating NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation. (B) In the treatment of colitis, BDX-01 improves gut dysbiosis, promotes
  the recovery of BSH-producing bacteria, such as Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, restores
  gut deconjugation, increases unconjugated/conjugated primary BA ratios, and activates
  FXR. BDX-01 and its metabolites directly activate FXR. FXR activation in intestinal
  epithelial cells and macrophages suppresses the NLRP3 inflammasome activation, downregulate
  the proinflammatory factors, and ameliorate colitis.
