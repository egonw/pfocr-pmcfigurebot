caption: '3-HIB supplementation to human hepatocytes alters key metabolic functions.
  Huh7 liver cells were treated with and without free FAs (1:1 M ratio of 50 μM PA
  and 50 μM OA) combined with and without 3-HIB supplementation (final concentration
  of 25 μM) (water was used as control), for 24 h before analyses. A: HIBCH mRNA expression
  in Huh7 cells measured by qPCR, calculated relative to the reference gene HPRT (n = 6).
  B: Relative FA uptake in Huh7 cells treated with or without FA for 24 h, followed
  by addition of fluorescent dodecanoic acid whose uptake was detected spectrophotometrically
  after 1 h (n = 9–12). C: Seahorse Cell Mito Stress Assay (OCR measurements) was
  performed using the Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer to assess the mitochondrial respiration
  in Huh7 (n = 10–12) 24 h after treatment. Basal levels (the three first OCR measurements)
  were obtained, before adding oligomycin, CCCP and rotenone/antimycin A, as indicated
  at the top in the upper left figure. Basal respiration, ATP production, maximal
  respiration, spare capacity and uncoupling were calculated for each well based on
  the OCR measurements. D: Effect of 3-HIB supplementation on ROS generation in Huh7
  cells treated with or without FA for 24 h, followed by addition of fluorescent probe
  whose uptake was detected spectrophotometrically after 1 h (n = 11). FA, fatty acid
  treatment.∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001 (unpaired t-test).'
