caption: RR inhibits the osteoclast P38 MAPK signaling pathway via MCU. (a) Raw264.7
  cells were planted in a 6-well plate until the cell confluency reaches 90%, treated
  with serum-free medium starvation for 2 h, and then replaced with serum-containing
  medium, and pretreated with or without RR (1.5 μM) for 2 h before stimulation with
  RANKL for 0, 15, 30, and 60 min. The cells were lysed with RIPA, and the expression
  of p-P65, P65, p-ERK, ERK, p-JNK, JNK, p-P38, and P38 was displayed with western
  blot. (b) Quantitative analysis results of p-P65, p-ERK, p-JNK, and p-P38 relative
  to P65, ERK, JNK, and P38 ratios are displayed. (c) BMMs were planted in 96-well
  plates, with the addition of RANKL, SB203580 (10 μM), and RR (1.5 μM) for 5 days,
  and osteoclast differentiation results were shown by TRAP staining. (d) Quantitative
  results of TRAP-positive multinuclear cells and area occupied. (e) Raw264.7 cells
  were planted in a 6-well plate, treated with serum-free medium starvation for 2 h,
  and then replaced with serum-containing medium and pretreated with or without RR
  (1.5 μM) and AA (10 μM) for 2 h before stimulation with RANKL for 0, 15, and 30 min.
  Western blot showed the expression of p-P38 and P38. (f) Quantitative analysis of
  the p-P38 relative to P38 ratio at different stimulus times. (g) The Raw264.7 cells
  were starved with serum-free medium for 2 h, and then replaced with serum-containing
  medium with or without RR (1.5 μM), AA (10 μM), and SB203580 (10 μM) for 2 h, and
  then stimulated with RANKL for 15 min. Western blot was used to show the expression
  of p-P38 and P38 expression. (h) Quantitative analysis of the p-P38 relative to
  P38 ratio. (i) The Raw264.7 were pre-transfected with si-MCU for 6 h, and then,
  the proteins were extracted after different times of RANKL stimulation. The western
  blot results showed the expression of p-P38, P38, and MCU. (j–k) Quantification
  of protein band gray values by Image J statistics. The data was presented as means
  ± SEM; n = 3; ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001, normalized to β-actin.
