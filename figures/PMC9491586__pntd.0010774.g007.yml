figure_title: Critical signaling pathways and genes involved in rCsCP- or CsCA- treated
  DSS-induced colitis mice
caption: (A) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the identified DEGs between DSS+PBS
  and DSS+rCsCP groups. The top 20 most prominently enriched pathways were shown.
  (B) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the identified DEGs between DSS+PBS and
  DSS+CsCA groups. The top 20 most markedly enriched pathways are shown. (C) Heatmap
  for the top 12 DEGs involved in most enriched signal pathways after rCsCP or CsCA
  treatment. Red and blue indicate gene up- and down-regulation, respectively. (D)
  The mechanism of down-regulation of IL-12 gene in the colon of mice with acute colitis
  elicited by rCsCP administration. The blue box indicates gene down regulation.
