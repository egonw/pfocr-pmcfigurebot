caption: Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and KEGG pathway enrichment of metabolome
  data. A & B, the heatmap of significantly DMs identified in ESI − (A) and ESI +
  mode (B) in PWB iPSCs as compared to the control ones; HCA was performed using the
  complete linkage algorithm of the program Cluster 3.0 and the results are visualized
  using Pheatmap 1.0.12 (Raivo Kolde). C & D, enriched KEGG pathways related to the
  perturbed metabolic networks involving DMs identified in ESI − (C) and ESI + mode
  (D); the enriched metabolic pathways are indicated by color (−log10 (P value)) and
  size (black ball, enrichment ratio). PWB_3921_9d, PWB_4221_3d, and Control_52521_8d
  were experimental duplications of PWB_3921_9, PWB_4221_3, and Control_52521_8, respectively.
