caption: 'Stemness characteristics of human endometrial epithelial cells are augmented
  after di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) treatment in 3D culture as detected using
  Western blot analysis. (A) pSMAD-2; (B) N-cadherin and SNAIL; (C) SOX2, OCT4, and
  KLF4 protein expression levels. β-actin was used as the internal loading control
  for data normalization. All data are expressed as relative values against their
  respective control group. Data represent the mean ± standard deviation of three
  independent experiments. ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001; # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01,
  and ### p < 0.001; † p < 0.05, †† p < 0.01 and ††† p < 0.001; ¤ p < 0.05, ¤¤ p <
  0.01 and ¤¤¤ p < 0.001.'
