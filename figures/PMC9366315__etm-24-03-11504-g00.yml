caption: IL-32 expression is upregulated in H/R-treated cells. (A) Following reoxygenation
  of the cells for 4, 8, and 16 h, the cell viability in each group was determined
  using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. (B) The expression levels of IL-32 in these
  groups of cells were subsequently assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR and (C) western blot assays. **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs. control. IL, interleukin;
  H/R, hypoxia and reoxygenation.

  inflammation and apoptosis during hypoxia/reoxygenation via the NOD2/NOX2/MAPK signaling
  pathway.
