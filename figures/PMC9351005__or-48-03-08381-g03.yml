caption: 'Cx32 regulates the expansion of LCSCs. (A) Effect of Cx32 knockdown on the
  mRNA expression levels of stemness-associated genes in HepG2 cells. (B) Effect of
  Cx32 overexpression on the mRNA expression levels of stemness-associated genes in
  HCCLM3 cells. (C and D) The expression levels of stemness-associated genes were
  examined by western blotting when HepG2 cells were transfected with shRNA-Cx32.
  The proteins were normalized with β-actin. (E and F) The expression levels of stemness-associated
  genes were observed when HCCLM3 cells overexpressed Cx32. The proteins were normalized
  with β-actin. (G and H) Effect of Cx32 knockdown on the sphere-forming capacities
  of HepG2 cells. Magnification, ×200. The bar graph shows the average number of spheres
  >100 µm in diameter. (I and J) Effect of Cx32 overexpression on the sphere-forming
  capacities of HCCLM3 cells. Magnification, ×200. The bar graph shows the average
  number of spheres >100 µm in diameter. For the aforementioned images, the error
  bars represent the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments; *P<0.05 vs. the
  NC group; or *P<0.05 vs. the overexpression EV group. (K and L) Efficiency of tumor
  formation of Cx32 overexpression in HCCLM3 cells. (M) Efficiency of tumor formation
  of HCCLM3 EV and HCCLM3 OE cells; number of injected cells: 1×103 and 5×103, n=8.
  (N) Efficiency of tumor formation of HCCLM3 EV and HCCLM3 OE cells; number of injected
  cells: 1×104, 5×104, n=8. Cx32, connexin 32; LCSCs, liver cancer stem cells; shRNA,
  small interfering RNA; NC, negative control; EV empty vector; OE, overexpression;
  EpCAM, epithelial cell adhesion molecule.'
