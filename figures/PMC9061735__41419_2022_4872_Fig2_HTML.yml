figure_title: miR-1298-5p inhibited the proliferation of glioma in vitro and vivo
caption: a, b Cell cycle analysis for U87MG and U251 cells transfected with miR-1298-5p
  mimics and a control sequence. The percentage of cells arrested in the G1/S phase
  is analyzed in a histogram (right panels). c–f The protein level of proliferation
  markers cyclinD1, P27, CDK6, and the AKT pathway in U87MG, U251 and P3 cells transfected
  with miR-1298-5p mimics and a control sequence were assessed by western blotting.
  Amounts of protein determined by densitometry of protein bands from three experiments.β-actin
  was the loading control. g–j The proliferation capacity of U87MG and U251 cells
  transfected with miR-1298-5p mimics were assessed using CCK8 assay and Edu assay.
  k In vivo bioluminescent imaging analysis of tumor growth in xenograft nude mice
  at day 10. l Quantification of luminescent signals in the Lenti-NC and OV-miR-1298-5p
  mice. m Survival analysis of nude mice orthotopically implanted with U87MG cells
  transfected with lentivirus overexpressing the control sequence or miR-1298-5p.
  (P = 0.0180 by log-rank analysis; data from 5 animals/group). n H&E staining of
  xenograft sections from miR-1298-5p-overexpressing or negative control U87MG cell
  tissues on the same day of execution. Data are shown as the mean ± SD of three independent
  experiments. Statistical significance was determined using one-way ANOVA test (*P < 0.05;
  **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001).
