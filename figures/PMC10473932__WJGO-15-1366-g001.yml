caption: 'Relative expression level of LINC01268 in gastric cancer. A: The relative
  expression level of LINC01268 in 62 cases of gastric cancer (GC) tissues was higher
  than that of adjacent noncancerous tissues (ANTs). Expression levels were normalized
  to ACTB levels; B: The expression level of LINC01268 was up-regulated in 39 GC tissues
  and down-regulated in 23 GC tissues [bars represent the ratio between the expression
  levels in GC tissues and ANTs (C/N, log scale) from the 62 patients]; C: The relative
  expression levels of LINC01268 in GC cell lines MGC80-3 and AGS were higher than
  those in normal gastric mucosa epithelial cell line GES-1. Expression levels were
  normalized to GAPDH levels. The results were shown as the mean Â± SD. bP < 0.01,
  dP < 0.0001. GC: Gastric cancer; ANT: Adjacent noncancerous tissue.'
