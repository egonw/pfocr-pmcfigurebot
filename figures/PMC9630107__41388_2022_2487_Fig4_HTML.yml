figure_title: Overview of mitochondria-related proteins and pathways regulated by
  Src
caption: 'A Mitochondrial Src (mtSrc) and Src-regulators present in mitochondria are
  shown in purple solid ovals. B Main mitochondrial metabolic pathways that can be
  regulated by Src. Blue solid ovals represent Src targets. C Other mitochondrial
  processes and pathways regulated by Src. References relating to Src regulation of
  each protein or pathway are indicated next to it. The tyrosine residues phosphorylated
  by Src are indicated together with the corresponding reference. PDH: pyruvate dehydrogenase;
  TCA: tricarboxylic acid; ETC: electron transport chain, OXPHOS: oxidative phosphorylation.'
