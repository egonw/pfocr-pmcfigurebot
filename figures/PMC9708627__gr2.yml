caption: 'A. Schematic representation of Interferon (IFN) perspective in SLE—cellular
  level—link between innate and adaptative immune response: the initial triggers (viral
  infections, UV light exposure, silica dust) release cellular debris from apoptotic
  cells, exposing Nucleic Acids (NA) and starting production of type I IFN from plasmacytoid
  Dendritic Cells (pDCs). When acting on a specific genetic background, a vicious
  circle will begin, with continue activation of pDCs and further release of IFN.
  Type I IFN acts as an immunomodulator, primming DCs to a potent antigen-presenting
  cells—mature DC (mDCs), and this will induce differentiation of naïve CD 4 ⁺ T cells
  (LfT CD4) and appearance of CD 8 ⁺ memory T cells (LfT CD8), with cytokine production
  and tissue inflammation and exposer of auto-antigens (auto Ag). B-cells function
  is also influenced by type I IFN, leading to an increased survival and activation,
  including differentiation and class-switch recombination, causing autoantibody (autoAb)
  production. B. Schematic representation of IFN response in multifactorial SLE and
  in monogenic diseases driven by IFN, emphasising common pathway, but different starter:
  multifactorial versus monogenic defect related to nucleic acid handling—molecular
  level: IFN production is normally induced by viruses, bacteria, or microbial nucleic
  acids via recognition through Patterns Recognition Receptors (PRRs). IFN binds to
  transmembrane receptor—IFNAR, followed by activation of Janus kinase (JAK) 1 and
  tyrosine kinase (TIC) 2 pathway with phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator
  of transcription (STAT) 1, STAT 2 proteins, and formation of interferon regulatory
  factor (IRF) 9. This will promote IFN—stimulated genes (ISG) responsible for action
  on both innate and adaptative immune response.'
