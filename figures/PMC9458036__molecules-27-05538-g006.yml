caption: RES suppressed hypoxia-induced oxidative stress and the accumulation of HIF-1α
  in rats. The serum content of (A) MDA and the activity of (B) CAT, (C) SOD, (D)
  T-AOC in rats from control group, hypoxia group, RES group were determined. (E)
  Immunohistochemistry staining results of HIF-1α of rats from control group, hypoxia
  group, RES group and (F) quantification. (G) Immunohistochemistry staining results
  of PHD2 of rats from control group, hypoxia group, RES group and (H) quantification.
  Values were expressed as mean ± SD. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01; all the assays were
  repeated more than three times.
