caption: Vitamin D–VDR-mediated effects on hepatitis C infection. The binding of vitamin
  D to VDR modulates the HCV-induced inflammatory response by inhibiting the TLR/NF-κB
  pathway and simultaneously suppressing the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
  The pathogenicity of HCV is modulated by calcitriol via the activation of VDR and
  blockade of PPAR-α/β/γ activity. The inhibitory effect of calcitriol on PPAR-α/γ
  leads to the suppression of viral infection, its inhibitory effect on PPAR-β/γ leads
  to a reduction in nitrative stress, and its inhibitory effect on PPAR-γ leads to
  a reduction in lipid accumulation. In parallel, the inhibition of apoJ and Grp78
  via the ERAD pathway by calcitriol contributes to HCV suppression. The IFN-α-induced
  binding of phosphorylated STAT1 to its DNA target sequences is enhanced by calcitriol.
  The silencing of VDR leads to an enhanced hepatocellular response to IFN-α treatment
  via the JAK-STAT pathway. HCV, hepatitis C virus; TLR, Toll-like receptor; VDR,
