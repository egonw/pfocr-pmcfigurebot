caption: Diseases-associated pathways and protein network in the mdig KO vs. WT MDA-MB-231
  cells as analyzed by IPA. (A), Top Diseases and Disorders, depicts the affected
  functional categories based on differentially expressed proteins where the Name
  column displays a category of diseases and functions showing Cancer, Organismal
  Injury and Abnormalities, Tumor Morphology, Cardiovascular Disease and Developmental
  Disorder as the top diseases in the proteomics dataset, along with the number of
  molecules associated with the individual diseases and disorder. (B), IPA of protein
  networks in the MDA-MB-231 KO over WT cells. The top five significant networks as
  determined by the IPA with their scores and associated functions has been shown.
  (C), Protein network showing the relationships and connectivity between the focus
  molecules of the network related to protein synthesis, RNA post transcriptional
  modification, DNA replication, Recombination and Repair. Red indicated increased
  and green indicates decreased expression. Star * represents the elevated ribosomal
  proteins in this pathway.
