caption: FOXA1 calibrates the alternative splicing equilibrium of PC by enhancing
  the production of dominant isoforms(A) Overview of alternatively spliced exon trajectories
  in the space defined by mean and standard deviation (SD) of exon inclusion levels
  (Ψs). Color codes indicate positive (red) and negative (blue) changes of mean and
  SD of Ψs between FOXA1 highly expressing tumors and remaining ones.(B) Cumulative
  distribution plots depict the number (N) of exons with either positive (red) or
  negative (blue) changes ranging from μ(Ψ)primary PC of 0.5 (i.e., mixed isoforms)
  to the boundaries of 0 and 1 (i.e., dominant isoforms). Dashed lines represent the
  expected mean cumulative distribution of events with inclusion changes generated
  by 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations. Gray area represents confidence intervals (5%–95%).
  Histograms of the number of exons with positive and negative changes are superimposed
  on the x axis. On left panel, a preponderance of blue over red indicates that FOXA1
  mostly inhibits exon inclusion, whereas the dominance of red compared with blue
  indicates a major enhancement of exon inclusion by FOXA1. On right panel, a preponderance
  of blue over red indicates that exons were more uniformly spliced across tumors
  by FOXA1, whereas the dominance of red compared with blue indicates more heterogeneous
  inclusion upon high FOXA1 expression.(C and D) Cumulative distribution plots depict
  differentially alternatively spliced events (N) with positive (red) and negative
  (blue) mean inclusion changes upon FOXA1 depletion in VCaP (C) and PC3 (D) cells
  ranging from mixed (i.e., μ(Ψ) = 0.5) to dominant (i.e., μ(Ψ) = {0,1}) isoform population.
  Histograms of the number of exons with positive and negative changes are superimposed
  on the x axis. A preponderance of blue over red indicates that FOXA1 mostly inhibits
  exon inclusion.(E) Over representation analysis performed on genes harboring FOXA1-regulated
  AS events in primary PCs and cell lines. Shape size and gene ratio indicate the
  number (from 12 to 59) and the fraction of selected genes in each pathway, respectively.
  Color key represents the statistical significance (FDR) of the enrichment. Only
  top 5 enriched pathways (FDR < 0.1), if any, are shown and sorted by statistical
  significance. For (B–D), stars indicate the significance of two-tailed exact binomial
  tests comparing the abundances of exons with positive and negative changes against
  a null hypothesis with probability = 0.5 in four groups of Ψs. ∗∗p <10−2 and ∗∗∗p < 10−3.
