caption: IVA stimulates 5-HT production in enteric serotonergic neurons to drive colorectal
  CSC self-renewal and tumorigenesis via 5-HT–Wnt axis. (A) Microbiota metabolite
  IVA inhibits the enrichment of NuRD complex onto Tph2 promoter to initiate Tph2
  expression, leading to the production of 5-HT in enteric serotonergic neurons. By
  engaging with the receptors HTR1B, HTR1D, and HTR1F on colorectal CSCs, 5-HT promotes
  the interaction between AXIN1 and HTR1B/1D/1F, thus promoting the stability of β-catenin,
  activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, and enhancing the expression of
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling target genes such as c-MYC and CCND1, leading to the self-renewal
  of colorectal CSCs and colorectal tumorigenesis. IVA, isovalerate; CSC, cancer stem
  cell.

  stem cells to initiate colorectal tumorigenesis.
