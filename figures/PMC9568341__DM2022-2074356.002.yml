caption: miR-664a-3p inhibits osteogenic differentiation and calcification of valvular
  interstitial cells. (a) RNA-FISH revealed the localization of miR-664a-3p in VICs.
  miR-664a-3p is stained in red and the nucleus in blue. Scale bar, 20 μm. (b) RT-qPCR
  was conducted to detect the miR-664a-3p expression in VICs after overexpression
  with a mimic or knockdown by an inhibitor. (c) Western blotting analysis of RUNX2,
  MST2, and OSTERIX expression in VICs after alterations in the level of miR-664a-3p.
  Quantitative analysis of the protein bands are shown on the right. (d) The formation
  of calcium nodules after alterations in the level of miR-664a-3p was detected by
  Alizarin Red staining. Quantitative analysis is shown on the right. Scale bar, 50 μm.
  (e) ALP activity in VICs after alterations in the level of miR-664a-3p was detected
  and quantitated by ALP staining assay. Scale bar, 200 μm. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01,
  and ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
