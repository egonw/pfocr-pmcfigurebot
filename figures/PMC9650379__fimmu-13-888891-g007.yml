caption: PCA and GSEA based on risk score groupings. (A) PCA distribution of clinical
  samples based on high- and low-risk groups. The three-dimensional graphs distinguish
  well between the distribution of patients in the high- and low-risk groups, where
  the distribution of the sample in the high-risk group is represented by red dots
  and the distribution in the low-risk group is represented by green dots. (B) GSEA
  showing the results of GO functional enrichment analysis for the high- and low-risk
  groups. The value 0 of the enrichment score is used as the cutoff value to show
  the top five GO functional enrichment analysis for high and low expression, respectively.
  (C) GSEA showing the results of KEGG signaling pathway enrichment analysis in the
  high- and low-risk groups. The value 0 of the enrichment score is used as the cutoff
  value to show the top five KEGG signaling pathway analysis for high and low expression,
  respectively.
