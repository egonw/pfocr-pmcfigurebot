caption: Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) regulate milk fat synthesis in HC11 cells
  through the Gαipathway (A) Oil red O staining images of HC11 cells treated with
  different concentrations of sodium acetate (NaAc), sodium propionate and sodium
  butyrate. Scale bars are 100 μm. (B) TAG content in intracellular and medium. The
  relative protein expression level of P-ERK/ERK and P-CREB/CREB were treated with
  different concentrations of NaAc (C–E), sodium propionate (F–H), and sodium butyrate
  (I–K). All data with error bars are averages ± SEM (n = 3). In histograms, no letter
  or the same letter above the bar graph indicates no significant difference (p > 0.05),
  and different letters indicate a significant difference (p < 0.05). Each small white
  dot represents a test value.
