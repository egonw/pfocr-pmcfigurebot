caption: Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after MSTN knockdown in
  HMSC. (A) Clean base number of all sample readings. (B) Filtering distribution map
  indicates the high quality of readings. (C) The location of readings indicates the
  normal distribution ratio of read sequences. (D) Clustering of DEGs among samples.
  (E) Volcano plot for the DEGs between control group and MSTN knockdown group. (F)
  Histogram of GO enrichment of DEGs. (G) KEGG pathway analysis on DEGs. (H) qPCR
  validation of DEGs. Red line represents the gene expression level in control group,
  and all bars represent the expression levels of tested genes in experimental groups
  treated with different miRNA targeting MSTN. All tested genes in experimental groups
  showed significant changes at p < 0.05 compared to the control group.
