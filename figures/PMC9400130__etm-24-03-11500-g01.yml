caption: Screening and identification of LTBP2 as a key DEG associated with BCR of
  PCa. (A) Lasso Cox regression algorithm was applied to screen DEGs associated with
  BCR of PCa in GEO-merged datasets. (B) SVM-RFE algorithm was performed to identify
  DEGs associated with BCR of PCa in GEO-merged datasets. (C) Venn diagram showing
  the overlap of 19 BCR-based DEGs between the two different algorithms. (D) PPI analysis
  of BCR-related DEGs in PCa using STRING database. (E) The STRING outcomes were uploaded
  to Cytoscape software to identify hub genes using MCODE algorithm in the PPI network.
  (F) Venn diagram revealed that LTBP2 was the only BCR-associated hub gene. LTBP2,
  latent transforming growth factor Î²-binding protein 2; DEG, differentially expressed
  gene; BCR, biochemical recurrence; PCa, prostate cancer; Lasso, least absolute shrinkage
  and selection operator; GEO, Gene Expression Omnibus; SVM-RFE, support vector machine
  with recursive feature elimination; PPI, protein-protein interaction; STRING, The
  Search Tool for Retrieving Interacting Genes; MCODE, molecular complex detection.
