caption: 'Chi3l1 is highly expressed in hUC-MSCs. (a) Heat map of differential gene
  expression in various MSCs, including BM-MSCs, hP-MSCs, hM-MSCs, and hUC-MSCs. (b)
  A volcano plot was used to analyze the DEGs (red indicates upregulated genes). (c)
  KEGG pathway indicating that Chi3l1 is highly associated with the JAK-STAT signaling
  pathway and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in hUC-MSCs. (d) Chi3l1 expression
  in different MSCs by qPCR. (e) hUC-MSCs were treated with IFN-γ and TNF-α (20 ng/ml)
  for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, and Chi3l1 mRNA levels were measured by qPCR. (f) The
  protein expression of Chi3l1 in IFN-γ- and TNF-α-pretreated hUC-MSC supernatants
  was analyzed by western blot. (g) The Chi3l1 protein expression levels in IFN-γ-
  and TNF-α-pretreated hUC-MSCs determined by western blot. JAK: Janus kinase; STAT:
  signal transducer and activator of transcription; IFN-γ: interferon-gamma; TNF-α:
  tumor necrosis factor-alpha.'
