caption: Predicted regulation network of pkaC based on the coexpression analysis.
  It demonstrated that the protein kinase PkaC could be the hub regulator involved
  in cell signalling, cell metabolism and morphology (blue boxes). The genes labelled
  in green boxes were down‐regulated with opposite gene expression pattern of pkaC,
  while the genes labelled in yellow boxes were up‐regulated by pkaC. The components
  in cAMP‐PKA signalling pathway were shown in green circles (down‐regulated), yellow
  circles (up‐regulated) and grey circles (not‐regulated). EMP, Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas
  pathway; GAC, glyoxylic acid cycle; OAA, oxaloacetic acid transport and metabolism;
  PPP, pentose phosphate pathway.
