caption: 'Syne‐1/H3K9me3 signaling pathway mediated the effect of EPO through EPOR/βCR
  heterodimer in primary neural stem and progenitor cells. (A) The flowcharts of LC–MS/MS
  analysis. (B) Coomassie brilliant blue staining of the SDS‐PAGE gel. The arrowhead
  indicates the protein bands. (C) Venn analysis of protein bands specifically pulled
  down by EPOR/βCR heterodimer from non‐EPO‐treated and EPO‐treated (EPO) neural stem
  and progenitor cell lysates. (D) The table of Syne‐1 peptides identified by LC–MS/MS.
  (E) The ion mass spectra of one matched peptide of Syne‐1. (F) Primary neural stem
  and progenitor cells were immunostained with βCR (red) and Syne‐1 (green) for confocal
  microscopy examination. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Scale bar: 5 μm. (G)
  Confocal microscopy was used to determine the colocalization of Syne‐1 (green) and
  H3K9me3 (red). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Scale bar: 50 μm. Cells were
  treated with βCR siRNA for 48 h and were then treated with EPO (50 U/ml) immediately
  after OGD. (H) Protein expression level of H3K9me3 was assessed by western blotting.
  n = 3/group. *p < 0.05 vs. the control group, #p < 0.05 vs. the OGD group, +p < 0.05
  vs. the EPO group'
