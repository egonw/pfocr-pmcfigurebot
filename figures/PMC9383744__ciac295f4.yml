caption: 'Host transcriptomic profiling and differential gene expression analysis
  of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)â€“positive patients, comparing severe acute
  respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epsilon variant and with control
  non-epsilon variant. A, B, Differential gene expression analysis between epsilon
  versus non-epsilon variant infected individuals (A) demonstrating Volcano plot of
  significantly up-regulated and down-regulated genes in epsilon variant (B) demonstrating
  gene ontology (GO) cellular component, biological process and molecular function
  enriched in up-regulated genes (top panel) and up-regulated biomolecular pathways
  (REACTOME, KEGG, Wiki pathways [bottom panel]). Abbreviations: AU, Adenylate-uridylate;
  AUF1, AU-rich element RNA-binding protein 1; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FDR, false
  discovery rate; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins; IFN, interferon;
  JNK, Jun N-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MHC, major histocompatibility
  complex; mRNA, messenger RNA; NS, not significant. C, Unsupervised clustering heat
  map demonstrates that epsilon share the most similar profiles in their differentially
  expressed genes when compared with non-epsilon variant in pathways involved in innate
  immune response. D, Pathway enrichment analysis between patients containing epsilon
  and non-epsilon variants.'
