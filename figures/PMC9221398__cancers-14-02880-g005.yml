caption: PTGS2 is transcriptionally activated by MAEL and involved in the MAEL-mediated
  regulation of stemness in HCC. (A) The plot of KEGG pathways in MAEL wildtype versus
  knockout PLC8024 cells. The color and size of the bubble represent the enrichment
  significance and gene numbers enriched in a pathway, respectively. (B) Gene set
  enrichment analysis (GSEA) demonstrates MAEL modulation significantly enriched in
  embryonic stem cell core. (C) The volcano diagram illustrates differentially expressed
  genes by MAEL knockout. Spots indicate genes differentially expressed between the
  two groups (red, upregulated; green, downregulated; gray, not significant genes;
  –Log10Padj > 2, |Log2Fold change| > 2). (D) Relative mRNA level of PTGS2 validated
  by qRT-PCR in MIHA, 8024, and Huh7 cells. (E) Schematic illustration of the luciferase
  reporter constructs containing PTGS2 promoter. (F) Relative luciferase activity
  in 293FT cells co-transfected with PTGS2-luciferase reporter and MAEL. Data represent
  the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. * p < 0.05; *** p < 0.001.
