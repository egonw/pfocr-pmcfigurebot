caption: 'Cebpb knockdown activated WNT signaling in mSSC osteogenic differentiation.
  (a) Expression of osteogenic differentiation signaling proteins determined by western
  blot in the Cebpb inhibition group and the control group. (b) Quantification of
  result (a). (c) Expression of WNT signaling and osteogenic differentiation proteins
  determined by western blot in the control, Cebpb inhibition, and WNT signaling inhibition
  groups. (d) Quantification of result (c). (e) Alizarin red S staining and alkaline
  phosphatase staining of mSSCs in the control, Cebpb inhibition, and WNT signaling
  inhibition groups. Scale bar: 200 μm. (f) Quantification of alizarin red S staining
  of result (e). (g) Quantification of alizarin red S staining of result (e). Cebpb-sh:
  mSSCs stably expressing the Cebpb-shRNA1 and Cebpb-shRNA2 sequence. ∗p < 0.05 compared
  with the control group, ∗∗p < 0.01 compared with the control group, ∗∗∗p < 0.001
  compared with the control group, #p < 0.05 compared with the Cebpb-sh group, ##p
  < 0.01 compared with the Cebpb-sh group, and ###p < 0.001 compared with the Cebpb-sh
  group. IWR1: inhibitor of WNT signaling.'
