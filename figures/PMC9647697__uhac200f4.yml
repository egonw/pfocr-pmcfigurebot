caption: Analysis of the VvSUN promoter and location analysis of VvSUN. (A) VvARF6
  interfaces with the VvSUN promoter, as shown by a Y1H assay. As bait, Y1H strains
  containing the promoters of VvSUN were employed in the experiment. pGADT7 was set
  as the vector for the control. (B) Measurement of GUS expression levels in grapevine
  leaves was accomplished based on the transient expression of the VvSUN promoter
  in response to varying dosages of IAA treatment. The 35S promoter acted as the positive
  control. Outcomes are presented as the means (± standard deviation) of three biological
  experiments. Lower-case letters (P ≤ .01) and capital letters (P ≤ .05) represent
  a significant difference among different treatments, as determined by Student’s
  t-test. (C) Histochemical staining of GUS function mediated by the VvSUN promoter
  under different concentrations of IAA treatment in grapevine leaves. The 35S promoter
  is the control and P0, P10, P50, and P100 represent the 0, 10, 50, and 100 mg/l
  IAA treatments, respectively. (D) Subcellular distribution of VvSUN in the leaves
  of N. benthamiana that had been transiently converted. 35S-GFP was adopted as the
  control, and expression was monitored utilizing a confocal laser scanning microscope.
  Chlorophyll channel (left 1), GFP channel (left 2), bright field (right 2), and
  merged images (right 1) are shown.
