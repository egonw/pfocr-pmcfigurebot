figure_title: RTN2 promotes EMT, migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells through
  ER Ca2+ efflux-mediated ERK activation
caption: A KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of RTN2-associated signalling pathways.
  B Western blot validation of predicted pathways. C The effects of U0126 (10 μM)
  on RTN2-associated ERK phosphorylation and EMT markers. D Transwell assays were
  performed to determine the invasion (left panel) and migration (right panel) capacities
  of MGC80-3 and AGS cells. E Cytoplasmic Ca2+ was evaluated by FACS after staining
  with Fluo-3 AM in RTN2-overexpressed or controlled gastric cancer cells. F The effects
  of RTN2 on Ca2+-related channels including IP3R, SERCA2, STIM and ORAI were examined
  by western blot. G MGC80-3 and AGS cells were transfected with RTN2 or empty vector,
  and applied to immunoprecipitation assay. H Gastric cancer cells were transfected
  as indicated and applied to western blot. I MGC80-3 and AGS were transfected with
  RTN2 or empty vector, treated with or without heparin (5 mg/mL), and then applied
  to western blot. D, E Results are presented as mean ± SD. Statistical significance
  was calculated by Student’s two-tailed t test. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001;
  ns no significance.
