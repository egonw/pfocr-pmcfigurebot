caption: 'Impact of Tanshinone IIA on Pyroptosis. (A) Expression levels of the cytokines
  IL-18 and IL-1β were examined using ELISA. (B) Western blot was used to assess the
  expression levels of key pyroptosis markers: NLRP3, IL-1β, pro-IL-1β, Caspase1,
  pro-Caspase1, and GSDMD-N/F. #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01 VS. control group; *p < 0.05
  and **p < 0.01 VS. model group. This indicates the significant downregulation of
  these markers in response to Tanshinone IIA intervention.'
