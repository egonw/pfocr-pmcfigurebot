caption: (A) Bar plot showing ligand receptor involved in intercellular signaling
  of LAMININ signaling pathway. The significance test between signaling pathway signals
  was computed using two-tailed unpaired Wilcoxon test using the presto package. (B)
  Table showing candidate gene ranking matrix. The “+” symbol indicates the presence
  and the “–“ sign indicates the absence of a parameter in each of the genes. (C)
  Expression of ACTN1 in TNBC, HER2, Luminal, and non-TNBC cell lines. Expression
  values were obtained from CCLE. The axis shows TNBC, HER2, Luminal, and non-TNBC
  cancer cell lines and the y axis is their mRNA expression levels. In the box-and-whisker
  plots, the horizontal lines mark the median, the box limits indicate the 25th and
  75th percentiles, and the whiskers extend to 1.5× the interquartile range from the
  25th and 75th percentiles. The significance test of expression levels of ACTN1 was
  performed using Kruskal–Wallis test in ggpubr package. (D) The expression of the
  20-gene signature across the cell types shown in upper plot of healthy breast, primary
  TNBC and chemotherapy-treated TNBC data sets and lower plot shows dataset-wise expression
  profile. The statistical testing of expression levels of 20 gene was performed using
  two-tailed unpaired Wilcoxon test in stat_compare_means() of ggpubr package. (E)
  The expression of basal markers (left violin plots) and luminal epithelial (right
  violin plot) markers across cell types of the healthy breast, primary TNBC and chemotherapy-treated
  TNBC cells.
