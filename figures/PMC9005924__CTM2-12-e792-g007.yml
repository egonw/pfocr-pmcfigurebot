caption: Prostate cancer‐associated ncRNA transcripts 1 (PCAT1) silencing induced
  cyclic GMP‐AMP synthase/stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS/STING) signalling in
  non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. (A) RNA sequencing (RNA‐seq) revealed
  high correlation between PCAT1 and cGAS/STING pathway. (B) PCAT1 depletion increased
  mRNA levels in PC9 and H1975 cells. (C) Representative immunofluorescence of cGAS
  and STING in PC9 and H1975 cells with PCAT1 deficiency. Scale bar, 50 μm. (D) Representative
  immunoblotting of cGAS, STING, p‐IRF3 and IRF3 in NSCLC cells with PCAT1 knockdown.
  (E) PCAT1 silencing decreased the mRNA levels of IFNβ, CCL5 and CXCL10 in PC9 and
  H1975 cells. (F) The secretion of IFNβ, CCL5 and CXCL10 was measured by enzyme‐linked
  immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in PCAT1‐deficient NSCLC cells. (G) Representative immunoblotting
  of cGAS in PC9 cells with cGAS knockdown. (H) cGAS depletion impaired the induction
  of cGAS/STING signalling pathway by PCAT1 downregulation. n = 3; *, p < .05; **,
  p < .01
