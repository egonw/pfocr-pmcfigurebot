caption: AIM2 inflammasome signaling pathway activation upon binding to DNA. AIM2
  recognizes dsDNA and leads to AIM2 polymerization, then the ASC protein is recruited
  via PYD domains and forms filaments (nucleates). Caspase 1 binds to the dsDNA–AIM2–ASC
  complexes and is activated, leading to the maturation of IL-1β and IL-18. Created
