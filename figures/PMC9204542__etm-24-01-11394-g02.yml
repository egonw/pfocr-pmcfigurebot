caption: Knockdown of PTP1B expression alleviates ox-LDL-induced oxidative stress
  in HUVECs to restore tubule-formation ability. (A) Levels of MDA, SOD and GSH-Px
  were evaluated using corresponding kits. (B) Tubule-formation ability was explored
  using endothelial tubule formation assay and (C) quantified. Magnification, x40.
  (D) VEGFA protein expression was measured using western blotting. Results represent
  the mean Â± SD. **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001. MDA, malondialdehyde; SOD, superoxide dismutase;
  GSH-Px, glutathione peroxidase; PTP1B, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B; ox-LDL,
  oxidized low-density lipoprotein; sh, short-hairpin; VEGFA, vascular endothelial
  growth factor A; NC, negative control.
article_title: PTP1B inhibition ameliorates inflammatory injury and dysfunction in
  ox-LDL-induced HUVECs by activating the AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway via negative
  regulation of KLF2.
