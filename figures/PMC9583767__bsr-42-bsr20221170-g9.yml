figure_title: Inhibition of DTYMK increased CDDP sensitivity in LUAD cells
caption: (A,B) Correlation matrix between DTYMK geneexpression and cancer stemness
  scores DNAss and RNAss. (C) MTT assay was used to examine cell survival rate under
  the treatment of si-DTYMK, CDDP, or si-DTYMK+CDDP. (D) GSEA analysis revealed that
  PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was highly enriched in DTYMK-high samples. (E) Western
  blot assay was used to examine protein expression levels.
