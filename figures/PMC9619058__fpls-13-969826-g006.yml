caption: Heatmap of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in sugarcane cultivar
  Co 97009 inoculated with the S. scitamineum isolates Ss97009 and SsV89101. (A) DEGs
  related to transcription factors and (B) flavonoid biosynthesis pathway with both
  the isolates at different time intervals (2 dpi, 5 dpi, and 60 dpi). Heatmaps were
  constructed using the log2 fold change values, and the genes in green and red represent
  up- and down-regulated genes respectively.
article_title: Transcriptome analysis of sugarcane reveals differential switching
  of major defense signaling pathways in response to Sporisorium scitamineum isolates
  with varying virulent attributes.
