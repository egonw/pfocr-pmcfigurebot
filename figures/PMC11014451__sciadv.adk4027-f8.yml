figure_title: A proposed model that TaNHX2 interacts with TaGAD1 to promote drought
  resistance in wheat
caption: The tonoplast-localized cation exchanger TaNHX2 contributes to drought resistance
  transduced by interacting with the C-terminal auto-inhibitory domain of TaGAD1,
  up-regulates TaGAD1 activity, and promotes GABA accumulation under drought stress.
  GABA has been found to reduce stomatal opening and increase WUE by negative modulation
  activity of a guard cell tonoplast-localized anion transporter ALMT9 (). TaNHX2
  promotes stomatal closure by enhancing GABA accumulation and signaling pathway upon
  drought stress and is essential for drought resistance in wheat.
