figure_title: OTUD5 positively regulates the mTOR signaling pathway
caption: A Flag-OTUD5 was immunoprecipitated (IP) from 293 T cells transfected with
  Flag-OTUD5 plasmid and the lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue
  staining. B Enrichment analysis of mass spectrometry results showed that OTUD5 is
  involved in the mTOR signaling pathway. C IB analysis of whole-cell lysates (WCL)
  derived from 253 J and UM-UC-14 cells stably expressing shOTUD5 and shNC. shNC was
  used as the negative control. p-mTOR, t-mTOR, p-S6K, p-4EBP1 and OTUD5 were detected.
  β-actin was used as the loading control. D IB analysis of WCL derived from T24 cells
  stably overexpressing OTUD5 and vector. Vector was used as the negative control.
  E, F UM-UC-14 shNC/shOTUD5 cells (E) and T24 Vec/oeOTUD5 cells (F) were subjected
  to amino acid starvation for 6 hours and resupplementation for 1 hour. p-S6K, p-4EBP1
  and OTUD5 were detected. G, H UM-UC-14 shNC/shOTUD5 cells (G) and T24 Vec/oeOTUD5
  cells (H) were treated with or without everolimus. I Representative images of OTUD5
  and p-mTOR IHC staining in patient-derived bladder cancer tissues. Scale bars, left
  500 μm, right 100 μm. J. Correlation analysis of OTUD5 and p-mTOR expression in
  patient-derived bladder cancer tissues. All data are presented as mean ± SD of 3
  independent experiments.
