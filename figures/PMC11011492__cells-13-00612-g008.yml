caption: 'Expression of gal-3 in cathepsin D+/NLRP3+ cells in the optic nerve of mice
  with EAE. (A,C) Frozen cross-sections of the optic nerve from EAE mice at peak disease
  were stained with anti-cathepsin D antibody (green), anti-NLRP3 antibody (red),
  and DAPI (blue). High-magnification image of inset in (A) is shown in (C). (B,D).
  Optic nerve sections from EAE mice at peak disease were also stained with anti-cathepsin
  D antibody (green), anti-NLRP3 antibody (red), anti-gal-3 antibody (cyan), and DAPI
  (blue). High-magnification image of inset in (B) is shown in (D). Quantitative analysis
  of the number of gal-3+/NLRP3+/cathepsin D+ cells in the optic nerve (E) and the
  ratio of gal-3+/NLRP3+/cathepsin D+ cells to gal-3+/NLRP3+ cells in the optic nerve
  (F). Five mice per group were examined. Scale bars: (A,B): 50 μm; (C,D): 25 μm.'
