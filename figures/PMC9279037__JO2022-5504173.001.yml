caption: Expression of tyrosine metabolism pathway-related genes in prostate cancer.
  (a) Heatmap showed the expression landscape of tyrosine metabolism-related genes
  between prostate cancer and normal prostatic tissues; (b) heatmap showed the expression
  landscape of tyrosine metabolism-related genes between metastatic prostate cancer
  and primary prostate cancer tissues; (c) Pearson analyses showed the correlation
  between genes encompassed in tyrosine metabolism pathways; (d) the regulation network
  and pathway enrichment of tyrosine metabolism pathway-related genes using GeneMANIA.
