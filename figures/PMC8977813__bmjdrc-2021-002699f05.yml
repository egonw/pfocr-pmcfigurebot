caption: Proposed pathway of trimetazidine (TMZ) effects on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced
  muscle insulin resistance (IR). The blue and red arrows show the effects of a HFD
  and TMZ on physiological processes; ⊕ signals the facilitating effects and Θ the
  inhibiting effects. Fatty acids stimulate the mitochondrial production of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) and inhibit the nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2
  (Nrf2) pathway in IR skeletal muscle, contributing to oxidative stress. The excessive
  ROS production leads to insulin signaling IRS1/AKT (insulin receptor substrate 1/protein
  kinase B) inhibition and adversely impacts insulin sensitivity. Though, exercise
  and TMZ were observed to activate Nrf2 signaling control, lowering mitochondrial
  ROS, resulting in improved insulin sensitivity. GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; HFD+Ex, HFD+exercise group.

  muscle insulin resistance of mice through Nrf2 signaling.
