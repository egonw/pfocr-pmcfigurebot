caption: Allicin inhibits OS growth and migration by promoting oxidative stress and
  autophagy via inactivation of the MALAT1-miR-376a-Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway axis.
  (a) The level of ROS was detected by DCFH-DA. (b) Autophagy was detected by transmission
  electron microscopy. (c) Protein expression of autophagy-related proteins, detected
  by western blot analysis. (d) mRNA expression of autophagy-related proteins, measured
  by RT-PCR. (e) Protein expression of Wnt3a and β-catenin, determined by western
  blot analysis. (f) mRNA expression of Wnt3a and β-catenin, measured by RT-PCR. n
  = 3. ∗P < 0.05.
