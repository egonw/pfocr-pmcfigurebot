caption: 'Changes in biosynthesis processes in early-stage MAFLD. (A–F) Heat maps
  resulting from z-score analyses and estimation plots for each pathway are included:
  (A) gluconeogenesis and glycogen synthesis, (B) glycolysis, (C) ketogenesis, (D)
  import to mitochondria, (E) TCA cycle, and (F) anaplerosis/cataplerosis. (A–F) Functional
  analysis of metabolic activities was investigated in primary hepatocyte cultures
  isolated from alb-SREBP-1c vs. C57Bl6 livers. (C) β-OH butyrate was analyzed in
  liver tissue. Estimation plots show the differences between means of alb-SREBP-1c
  vs. C57Bl6 (±95% CI) (mean z-score: left axis, effect size: right axis). Functional
  analysis show data expressed as means (±95% CI, n = 3–6 per group, depending on
  the assay). Statistics: Mann–Whitney test or two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple
  comparisons, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001. C57: C57Bl6, alb1c: alb-SREBP-1c,
  Pyr/Lac: pyruvate, lactate.'
