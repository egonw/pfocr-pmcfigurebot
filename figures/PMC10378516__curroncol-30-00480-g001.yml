caption: EGFR-MAPK signaling pathway and the targeted point by specific inhibitors.
  (A) Normal MAPK pathway. (B) HER2 amplification. HER2 forms homodimer or couples
  with heterodimeric partners, EGFR or HER3. (C) BRAF activating signaling. A triple
  combination with BRAF, MEK, and EGFR inhibition demonstrated significant clinical
  benefit. (D) KRAS activating signaling be specific mutation at G12C. The dual inhibition
  of KRASG12C and EGFR demonstrated a better response. The addition of SHP2 inhibition
  might overcome the resistance of the KRASG12C inhibitor.
