caption: Differentially abundant transcripts (DATs) in drought-tolerant (DT) and drought-sensitive
  (DS) chickpea genotypes under control (C) and drought stress (D) conditions. DATs
  in the DT and DS genotypes were identified under drought stress as compared to control,
  DT(D/C) and DS(D/C), respectively, and between DT and DS genotypes under control
  condition, [DT(C)/DS(C)]. (A) Venn diagram showing common and specific DATs in DT(D/C),
  DS(D/C) and DT(C)/DS(C) comparisons, where total number of transcripts are shown
  by black color font, and up- and down-regulated transcripts are presented by red
  and blue color fonts, respectively. (B, C) Bubble plots showing significantly enriched
  pathways among up- (B) and down-regulated (C) transcripts in DT(D/C), DS(D/C) and
  DT(C)/DS(C) comparisons. Top 20 pathways with P-value ≤ 0.05 were selected. The
  bubble size defines the number of transcripts assigned to the pathway and bubble
  color represents P-value as per the given scale.
