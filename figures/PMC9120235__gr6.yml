caption: 'Human interactome model of protein interactions and metabolic reactions.
  Graph vertices represent pathway participants: gene products (green), metabolites
  (blue) and auxiliary nodes/nodes with label of biological effect (grey). Graph edges
  are interactions between pathway participants. Edges inherit color from donor nodes.
  (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader
  is referred to the web version of this article.)'
