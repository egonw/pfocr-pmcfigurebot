caption: Pexmetinib suppressed osteoclastic gene expression via down-regulating NFATc1.
  (A-F)Nfatc1, Dc-stamp, Trap, Ctsk and Mmp-9 gene expression in BMMs treated with
  different doses of Pexmetinib (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 μM) for 5 days under RANKL stimulation
  were analyzed by real-time PCR. RNA expression levels were normalized relative to
  the expression of Gapdh. (G) NFATc1 and CTSK protein levels in BMMSs treated with
  or without Pexmetinib for 0, 3 and 5 days were determined by Western blotting. (H-I)
  The grey levels of NFATc1 and CTSK was quantified and normalized to GAPDH using
  Image J. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01. Data are expressed as means ± SEM, n = 5.
