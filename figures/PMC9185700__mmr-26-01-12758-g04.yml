caption: miR-423-5p promotes TGF-β1-induced EMT through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
  pathway. (A) The protein expression of PI3K, AKT and mTOR was detected by immunohistochemistry
  (scale bar=50 µm.). (B) The relative expression of p-PI3K, p-AKT and p-mTOR in BEAS-2B
  cells transfected with a miR-423-5p mimic or inhibitor for 24 h and then treated
  with TGF-β1 for 24 h was determined by western blot analysis. (C) The relative expression
  of p-PI3K, p-AKT and p-mTOR was determined by western blot analysis. BEAS-2B cells
  transfected with siRNA-FOXP4 to silence FOXP4 were transfected with a miR-423-5p
  inhibitor for 24 h and then treated with TGF-β1 for 24 h. *P<0.05 and **P<0.01.
  miR, microRNA; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition; p-, phosphorylated; si, short
  interfering.
