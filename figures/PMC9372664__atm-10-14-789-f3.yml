caption: 'Rha regulated cell proliferation of KGN cells through modulating Wisp2 expression.
  KGN cells were treated by DHEA and H-Rha, along with Wisp2 or sh-Wisp2 transfection.
  (A) Wisp2 expression in KGN was examined by qRT-PCR; (B) KGN cell viability measured
  by CCK-8; (C) cell proliferation was detected by EdU incorporation assay. n=3. Data
  are exhibited as mean ± SD. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 vs. control group; ##P<0.01,
  ###P<0.001 vs. DHEA group; &&P<0.01, &&&P<0.001 vs. DHEA + H-Rha group. qRT-PCR,
  quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction; CCK-8, cell counting kit-8; EdU,
  5-ethynyul-2’-deoxyuridine; SD, standard deviation; DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone;
  OD, optical density.'
