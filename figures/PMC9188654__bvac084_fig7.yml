caption: 'Time-dependent subcellular localization following ucOCN stimulation in C2C12
  cells. (A) Time-dependent subcellular localization after ucOCN stimulation in C2C12
  cells. C2C12 cells were grown on sterile cover glasses placed in 24-well culture
  dishes and stimulated with 0.5 ng/mL of ucOCN for the indicated times. Subcellular
  localization of ucOCN was confirmed using an anti-ucOCN antibody and an Alexa Fluor
  488-conjugated goat anti-Mouse IgG H&L antibody. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI
  solution (blue). (B) CON groups were treated with DMEM containing 10% FBS without
  ucOCN. Other groups were treated with 0.5 ng/mL ucOCN in DMEM containing 5% FBS
  for the indicated times. Proteins were extracted from cell membranes and the cytoplasmic
  and nuclear fractions. The extracted proteins were subjected to Western blot and
  analyzed using an anti-ucOCN antibody. (C) C2C12 cells were incubated with 200 μM
  Genistein (caveolae-mediated endocytosis inhibitor) or 20 μM Pitstop2 (clathrin-mediated
  endocytosis inhibitor) for 15 minutes and then treated with 0.5 ng/mL ucOCN for
  15 minutes. ucOCN localization was analyzed by immunocytochemical analysis. Green
  fluorescence signal indicates ucOCN and DAPI staining was used as a nucleus counterstain.
  (D) Subcellular localization of ucOCN and Cav-1 (caveolin-1: caveolae-mediated endocytosis
  marker) were analyzed by confocal microscopy.'
