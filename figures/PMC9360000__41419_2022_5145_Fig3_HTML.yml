figure_title: OTUD1 upregulates type I IFN antiviral pathway
caption: 'a The poly(A:T)-mediated IFN antiviral pathway is suppressed in Otud1−/−-MEFs.
  Otud1+/+- and Otud1−/−-MEF cells were stimulated with 1 μg/ml poly(A:T) for the
  indicated periods, and the cell lysates were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies.
  b The expression of IRF3-target genes is suppressed in poly(A:T)-treated Otud1−/−-MEF
  cells. MEFs were stimulated with 1 μg/ml poly(A:T) for the indicated periods, and
  the mRNA levels were assessed by qPCR. c The suppressed poly(I:C)-mediated antiviral
  response in Otud1−/−-MEFs. Otud1+/+-- and Otud1−/−-MEFs were stimulated with 10 μg/ml
  poly(I:C) for the indicated periods, and cell lysates were immunoblotted with the
  indicated antibodies. d Reduced poly(I:C)-mediated antiviral response in Otud1−/−-BMDMs.
  BMDMs from Otud1+/+-- and Otud1−/−-mice were stimulated with 10 μg/ml poly(I:C)
  for the indicated periods, and a qPCR analysis was performed. e, f Sendai virus
  (SeV)-induced antiviral response is suppressed in Otud1−/−-cells. Otud1+/+-- and
  Otud1−/−-MEFs (e) or BMDMs (f) were infected with SeV at a CIU of 10 for 1 h, incubated
  for the indicated periods, and then subjected to qPCR analyses. b, d–f Data are
  shown as mean ± SD by ANOVA post-hoc Tukey test (n = 3). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001, NS: not significant. g–i Suppressed transcription
  of IRF3-target genes in Otud1−/−-MEFs. Otud1+/+- and Otud1−/−-MEFs were stimulated
  with 10 μg/ml poly(I:C) for 2 and 4 h, and RNA-seq analyses were performed. g A
  principal component analysis of the RNA-seq analysis. h Taking the cutoff value
  of 10, significantly varied mRNAs are shown by the heatmaps. i Taking the cutoff
  value of 3.0, pathway analyses of 179 down-regulated genes were performed by MSigDB
  Hallmark 2020 and listed in ascending order of P-value.'
