caption: Mechanism of individualized tumor vaccine combined with ICIs in the treatment
  of tumors. (a) Tumor cells undergo DNA-specific mutations that produce neoantigens.
  (b) Specific individualized tumor vaccines enable T cells to express specific TCR
  receptors that recognize neoantigens, thus enabling T cells to target tumor tissues.
  (c) Combined with the PD-1/PD-L1 antibody, the activation of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway
  was blocked. This prevents the inactivation of tumor-specific T cells that target
  neoantigens.
