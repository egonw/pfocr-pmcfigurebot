figure_title: Intratumoral Bacteria Load Negatively Associated With T-Lymphocyte Infiltration
caption: 'A, Heatmap showing molecular features of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma
  with a high or low bacterial load through gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA), with
  knowledge-based annotation of 4 main types: metastasis, proliferation, immune response,
  and other pathways. B, Circos plot showing the significantly enriched immunological
  pathways in tumors with a low bacterial load. The outermost circle represents the
  number of genes contained in the labeled pathway. The size of the second outer circle
  represents the number of genes enriched by GSEA, and the color depth represents
  the adjusted Benjamini-Hochberg P value. The inner bar plot shows the normalized
  enrichment score. Different colors in the circle represent the category of pathways.
  C, The immune infiltration of patients with a high or low bacterial load estimated
  by the microenvironment cell populations (MCP)â€“counter algorithm. The comparison
  was performed with paired Wilcoxon signed rank test. BCR indicates B-cell receptor;
  CTLs, cytotoxic T-lymphocytes; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; NK,
  natural killer; PID, Pathway Interaction Database; TCR, T-cell receptor.'
