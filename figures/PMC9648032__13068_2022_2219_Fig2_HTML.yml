caption: 'Functional analysis of major mutations found in the evolved strains. a RNA-seq
  transcriptome analysis illustrated the expression level of genes involved in glucose
  uptake system, glycolytic pathway, TCA cycle and transcriptional regulons including
  gntR and galR, crp regulons and sugar phosphate stress. Expression change (log2
  fold change) of pfkA and gnd genes was unable to be calculated due to loss of expression
  and it was marked with an asterisk (*). Unexpected expression level of the pfkB
  gene of ALE-1 was affected by a remained coding sequence of pfkB (Additional file
  : Figure S8). b Functional validation experiments identified effective target genes
  among mutated genes from ALE-1: lacking the Gnd function, and loss of function for
  GntR and de-repression of its target genes, edd and eda. Error bars indicate standard
  deviations of growth measurements for three independent biological replicates. c
  Combined fluorescence histograms of MG1655, ALE-1, MG1655 Δpgi ΔgntR strains carrying
  pHexR-GFP. d The schematic diagram illustrates altered glucose metabolism in ALE-1
  through the EDP, via enzymes encoded by edd and eda. Transcriptional repression
  by GntR is indicated with red marks'
