caption: 'p65-NF-κB inhibition partially reversed metabolic imbalance by superabundant
  RIP140. (A) ARPE-19 cells were infected with Ad-RIP140 (MOI 60, 48 h), simultaneously
  with p65 siRNA or Bay 11-7082 (10μM, 24 h) treatment. (A) Nuclear protein levels
  of NF-κB were assayed by Western blot. (B) Protein levels and (C) mRNA levels of
  PPAR-γ, (D) secretion levels of TNF-α, IL-β, and IL-6, (E) ATP production, (F) glycogen
  accumulation were performed as described in . *** p < 0.001 vs. Ad-GFP group. ###p
  < 0.001 vs. Ad-RIP140 group.'
