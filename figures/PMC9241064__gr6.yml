caption: 'CO-RBC exerts antifibrotic effect against IR-AKI to CKD. (A) A schematic
  summary of the administration schedule used for saline or CO-RBC against IR-AKI
  to CKD. (B) Weight fluctuations were monitored until 14 days after IR (n = 5/group).
  To assess the tubular cell damage, collagen accumulation and EMT pathway, kidney
  was collected 14 days after renal IR with or without CO-RBC treatment, then analyzed
  by (C) PAS and TUNEL staining, (D) picrosirius red and masson''s trichrome staining,
  (E) quantification of hydroxyproline (n = 5/group), (F) immunostaining and (G) immunoblot
  (n = 5/group). Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E.M. #p < 0.01 compared with
  control group vs saline administration or CO-RBC administration group. *p < 0.05
  compared with saline administration group vs CO-RBC administration group. (For interpretation
  of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
  Web version of this article.)'
