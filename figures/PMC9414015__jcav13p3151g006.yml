caption: Lycorine inhibited tumor growth in vivo. (A) Images of the tumor. C57/BL
  male mouse were injected with RM-1 to establish tumor xenograft mode. Then lycorine
  was given every day. When the tumor-burdened group's tumor mass reached 1 cm3, mice
  were sacrificed, and the tumor was taken out and weighted. (B) Tumor weight. (C)
  HE-staining (×20) showed the tumor tissues of mice. (D) Immunofluorescence assay
  analysis were used to detect the expression of p65 (×20). (E) Immunohistochemistry
  analysis were used to detect the expression of p-p65 and p-IKKβ (×20). (F) Lycorine
  inhibited apoptosis-related proteins in vivo by Immunohistochemistry assay. *P<0.05,
  **P<0.001.
