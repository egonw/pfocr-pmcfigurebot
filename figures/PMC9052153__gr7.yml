caption: Overexpression of hCAR represses EPO downstream signaling in HepG2 and Hep3B
  cells.A, schematic illustration of the EPO–EPOR signaling pathway. B and C, HepG2-hCAR
  and Hep3B-hCAR cells were treated with vehicle control or Dox (1 μg/ml) for 72 h
  before Western blotting analysis of total and phosphorylation of STAT3 (p-STAT3-Y705),
  AKT (p-AKT-S473), and ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2-T183/Y185). D, relative blot densitometry
  was quantified using ImageJ from three separately prepared cell experiments and
  normalized to the density of the loading control. Data are expressed as mean ± SD
  (n = 3). ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01. Dox, doxycycline; EPO, erythropoietin; EPOR,
  EPO receptor; ERK1/2, extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2; hCAR, human constitutive
  androstane receptor; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3.

  and hepatoma cell proliferation by inhibiting erythropoietin signaling.
