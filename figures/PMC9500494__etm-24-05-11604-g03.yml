caption: Knockdown of IMPA2 expression reduces xenograft tumorigenesis of the ES-2
  cell line in nude mice. A total of 5x106 ES-2 cells stably expressing shCtrl and
  shIMPA2 were subcutaneously injected into 4-week-old female BALB/c nude mice. On
  day 26, the mice were euthanatized. (A) Images of the tumors were obtained and subsequently
  the (B) tumor volumes and (C) tumor weight were measured. (D) The expression of
  IMPA2 in tumors was determined by western blot analysis. ***P<0.001 vs. shCtrl.
  IMPA2, inositol monophosphatase 2; sh, short hairpin; Ctrl, control.
article_title: Inositol monophosphatase 2 promotes epithelial ovarian cancer cell
  proliferation and migration by regulating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
