caption: The effect of the NF-κB signaling pathway on the apoptosis. (A–E) WB demonstrated
  that the expression of TLR4, p-p65 and p-IκB/IκB were significantly inhibited by
  NF-κB inhibitor (BAY 11-7082). (F) The cell viability among three groups. (G, H)
  Flow cytometry assay showed that there was an increased apoptosis level in the si-miR93-5p
  + BAY group. (I–K) The protein expression of Bax and Bcl-2 among three groups. p
  < 0.05 (“*”), p < 0.01 (“**”), p < 0.001 (“***”), p < 0.0001 (“****”).
