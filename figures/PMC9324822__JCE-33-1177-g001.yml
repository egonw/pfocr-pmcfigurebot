caption: Atrial overdrive pacing from CS 1−2 advanced the tachycardia with an A‐H‐A
  response. Pacing was initiated after the slow pathway refractory so that it anterogradely
  captured and advanced the tachycardia via the slow pathway. Note that the PPI at
  the proximal CS electrograms (CS 9, 10) as a proxy for septal activation had a PPI‐TCL
  of 30 or 40 ms depending on how one measures the TCL. This value confirmed that
  the atrial septum near the tricuspid annulus was part of the reentrant circuit.
  CS, coronary sinus; PPI‐TCL, post pacing interval minus tachycardia cycle length
