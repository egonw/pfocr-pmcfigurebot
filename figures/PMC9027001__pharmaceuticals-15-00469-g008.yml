caption: Graphical abstract. In this study, we revealed the effects of rutaecarpine
  (Rut) on thermogeneis and weight management. Rut can reduce adiposity, improve insulin
  resistance and increase respiratory activity in mice with HFD-induced obesity. The
  mechanism of the effects of Rut involved AMPK/PGC-1α pathway, and we demonstrated
  that AMPK deficiency in adipose tissue suppressed the upregulation of thermogenic
  markers and beneficial metabolic effects in Rut-treated mice.
