caption: 'Klotho affected the IGF-1/PI3K signaling pathway. (a) IGF-1R, p-IGF-1R,
  and IGF-1 protein levels were tested by western blot. (b) Immunofluorescence was
  used to detect p-IGF-1R levels. (c) Western blot of PI3K/p-PI3K, Akt/p-Akt, and
  mTOR/p-mTOR protein levels. âˆ—p < 0.05 compared with the NC group. #p < 0.05 compared
  with the HG group.'
