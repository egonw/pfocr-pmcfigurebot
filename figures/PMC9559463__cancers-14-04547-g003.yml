caption: Schematic representation of the immunological aspects of the basal cell carcinoma
  (BCC). (A) The tumor microenvironment is characterized by decreased infiltration
  of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and increased presence of regulatory T cells (T reg). Dendritic
  cells (DC) of an immature phenotype are present in in the tumor microenvironment
  of laBCC. Increased expression of TH2 cytokines (interleukin [IL]-4, IL-5) and transforming
  growth factor (TGF)-Î², as well as IL-10, supports an immunosuppressive environment
  surrounding the tumor. In addition to a high mutational load, tumor cells are characterized
  by the expression of the inhibitory molecules programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1)
  and PD-L2, which can suppress T cell activity by binding to programmed cell death
  protein 1 (PD-1) on T cells; (B) loss-of-function mutations in PTCH1 or activating
  mutations in SMO activate the HH signaling pathway in laBCC cells; (C) decreased
  expression of the transporter associated with antigen processing-1 (TAP-1) and major
  histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I lead to decreased recognition of tumor cells
  by the immune system.
