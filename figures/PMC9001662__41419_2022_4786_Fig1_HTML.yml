figure_title: P2X7/NLRP3 signaling pathway activity arises in STZ-induced diabetic
  mice
caption: a The relative mRNA expression of caspase 1, ASC, Icam1, P2X7, NLRP3, IL-1β,
  and IL-18 at different time points (4 and 12 weeks after STZ induction). b The relative
  protein levels of P2X7, NLRP3, IL-1β, and IL-18 in the retinal tissue of mice at
  the 4th and 12th weeks. c Immunofluorescence analysis and nuclear staining of retinal
  tissue sections from each group of mice with anti-NLRP3 antibody (red) and DAPI
  (blue), from top to bottom, normal control; diabetic mice (induced with STZ for
  one month); diabetic mice (induced with STZ for three months). d Representative
  photomicrographs showing hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining of retinal sections. Scale
  bar = 50 μm. e Mice were infused with EB dye for 10 min detected the fluorescence
  signal of the flat-mounted retinas using a fluorescence microscope. Data are expressed
  as the mean ± SD (n = 3). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 vs. the control group.
