caption: The route of Wnt/-catenin signaling. (A) Phosphorylation and degradation
  of beta-catenin are prevented when Wnt proteins bind to LR-P-5/6 and F-ZD, resulting
  in catenin stability, accumulation, and nuclear translocation, as well as pathway
  activation. (B) Once the Wnt antagonists Dkk-1, SOST, and s-FRP prevent Wnt binding
  to receptors, beta-catenin is phosphorylated by Ck-1 and GS-K-3 and then destroyed
  by the 26S proteasome. Rspo proteins and their receptors, LG-R-4, LG-R-5, and LG-R-6,
  positively control Wnt receptor Fz-d and Wnt co-receptor LR-P-5/6 at the cell surface,
  while E-3 ubiquitin ligases RN-F-43 and ZNR-F-3 negatively regulate them.
