caption: Expressions of de novo HBP enzymes are increased in AML. AML LSCs show increased
  oxidative phosphorylation and AML blasts show increased glycolysis (). This study
  shows that HBP is increased both in AML LSCs and AML blasts. De novo HBP in AML
  may utilize the rate limiting step enzyme GFAT1. OGT is elevated in AML. Expression
  of salvage HBP enzyme NAGK is decreased in AML Created with BioRender.

  biosynthetic pathway and O-GlcNAcylation in acute myeloid leukemia blasts and stem
  cells.
