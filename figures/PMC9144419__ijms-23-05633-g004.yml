caption: Deoxidizing absorbers method induces cell cycle arrest, accumulation of cancer
  stem cells, and accumulation of Snail and Twist. (A,B) The pie graphic demonstrates
  an increased number of cells in the G0/G1 phase under hypoxia compared to normoxia
  (*** p < 0.001). (C,D) Deoxidizing absorbers induced the continuous accumulation
  of cancer stem cells measured at baseline (normoxia), 12 h, and 24 h (ALDH+/CD44++
  positive cells) (* p < 0.05). (E) Immunofluorescence staining for Snail and Twist
  on 4 different epithelial cell lines. WSU-HN12 and WSU-HN13 are squamous cell carcinomas,
  HaCaT is a human immortalized skin cell line, and UM-HACC-2A is a salivary gland
  adenoid cystic carcinoma cell line. Note the weak immunofluorescence staining for
  Snail (Alexa 568—red) in all 4 cell lines cultured under normoxia compared with
  hypoxic conditions (scale bar 50 µm). Immunofluorescence staining for Twist (Alexa
  568—red). Note the weak staining in all 4 cell lines cultured under normoxia and
  accumulation of Twist in all cell lines during hypoxia. Hoechst 33,342 counterstaining
  for DNA content is in blue (scale bar 50 µm). (F) Diagram representing the biological
  effects of deoxidizing-absorbers-induced hypoxia over epithelial cells. Deoxidizing
  absorbers may be used to achieve rapid vs. gradual onset of hypoxia. They are also
  effective in triggering the EMT phenotype in epithelial cells, increasing the intracellular
  levels of ROS, activating the mTOR pathway, inducing cell cycle arrest (G0/G1),
  and in promoting the accumulation of cancer stem cells.
