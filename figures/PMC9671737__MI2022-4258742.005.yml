caption: ST3GAL3 regulated the TLR9/MyD88 signalling pathway. (a) GSEA software was
  used to analyse the enrichment signalling pathways associated with ST3GAL3 in RA.
  TLR signalling pathway was finally screened out. (b) Western blotting results showed
  that ST3GAL3 overexpression promoted the expression of TLR9 and MyD88. (c) Western
  blotting results showed that si-ST3GAL3 inhibited the expression of TLR9 and MyD88.
  (d) Western blotting result showed that si-ST3GAL3 inhibited sLeX levels in MH7A
  cells. (e) Western blotting result showed the activated TLR9/MyD88 signalling pathway
  by adding with sLeX in MH7A cells. (f) ELISA results showed that ST3GAL3 overexpression
  increased IL-1β and TNF-α levels. n = 3. ∗∗∗p < 0.001 compared with the indicated
  group.
