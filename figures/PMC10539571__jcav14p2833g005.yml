caption: 'PRMT7 affects gastric cancer cell proliferation and migration via the PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathway. A CCK-8 assay was used to detect the effect of LY294002 on the
  viability of gastric cancer cells. B Colony formation assay was used to detect the
  effect of LY294002 on the proliferation of gastric cancer cells. C Transwell assay
  was used to detect the effect of LY294002 on the migration ability of gastric cancer
  cells. D LY294002 reversed the effect of PRMT7 knockdown on PI3K/AKT signaling.
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 and ns: no significance.'
