caption: Identification of differentially expressed pathways and transcriptomic-metabolomic
  integrative analysis(A) Enrichment of pathways in high Peri_V_DN group compared
  with low Peri_V_DN group using GSEA (left panel based on KEGG; right panel based
  on Reactome).(B) A pathway-based analysis of metabolomic changes between Peri_V_DN
  groups. The differential abundance (DA) score captured the overall change in a metabolic
  pathway. A score of 1 indicated that all metabolites in this pathway increased in
  high Peri_V_DN group compared with low Peri_V_DN group, and a score of −1 indicated
  that all metabolites in this pathway decreased.(C) Transcriptomics and metabolomics
  distinctions in fatty acid biosynthesis pathway between Peri_V_DN groups. Log2-fold
  changes of mRNA expression levels and metabolite abundances in high Peri_V_DN tumor
  samples compared with low Peri_V_DN tumor samples were demonstrated.CoA, coenzyme
