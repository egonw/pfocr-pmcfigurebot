caption: (a) Volcano map of DEGs; R2 vs. R4, R2 vs. R5, W2 vs. W4, and W2 vs. W5 (from
  left to right). Abscissa represents multiples of changes in gene expression. Ordinate
  represents DEGs significance levels. Red and green dots represent upregulated and
  downregulated DEGs, respectively. Blue dots represent non-DEGs. (b) Venn diagram
  of DEGs; CK vs. LP and CK vs. HP. (c) Enrichment scatter diagram; R2 vs. R4, R2
  vs. R5, W2 vs. W4, and W2 vs. W5 (from left to right). The ordinate and abscissa
  represent the KEGG pathway and rich factor, respectively. The degree of enrichment
  increases with rich factor. The dot size is proportional to the number of enriched
  DEGs in the pathway. Red color intensity increases with enrichment significance.
