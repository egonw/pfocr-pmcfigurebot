caption: Antiproliferative effects of eribulin, paclitaxel and vinorelbine on 100
  CCLE cell lines. (A) Correlations of IC50s for eribulin versus paclitaxel and vinorelbine,
  with eribulin versus itself shown to compare slopes with paclitaxel and vinorelbine
  (R2 and p-values not shown for eribulin versus itself). For eribulin (B), paclitaxel
  (C) and vinorelbine (D), cell lines are ordered from most sensitive (left) to least
  sensitive (right), with IC50s as log[M]. The most and least sensitive quartiles
  for each drug are delineated by vertical dashed lines. Measured IC50s for 5 eribulin
  and 1 paclitaxel cell lines exceeded the highest concentrations tested for these
  2 drugs; see Material and Methods for correction strategies used. Panels (E,F) show
  Venn diagrams of numbers of unique and overlapping cell lines in the most and least
  sensitive cell line quartiles for each drug.
