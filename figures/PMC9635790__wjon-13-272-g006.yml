caption: 'The influence of Vinco on the expression of PTEN, and the PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathway is regulated by PTEN express in HCC cells. (a) HLE, Bel 7402 and PLC/PRF/5
  cells were treated with Vinco (80 µg/mL) for 48 h, and the expression and localization
  of PTEN in these cells were observed by laser confocal microscopy. (b) HLE, Bel
  7402 and PLC/PRF/5 cells were treated with Vinco (10 µg/mL or 80 µg/mL) for 48 h,
  and the expression of PTEN, pAKT (Ser473), pmTOR (Thr2448) was detected by Western
  blotting. The bar graphs on the right show relative expressed quantity of these
  proteins, with P < 0.05 indicating statistical significance; *P < 0.05 and **P <
  0.01 vs. control and Vinco (10 µg/mL)-treated groups. The images are representative
  of at least three independent experiments. Vinco: vincosamide; HCC: hepatocellular
  carcinoma; PTEN: phosphate and tension homology deleted on chromosome 10.'
