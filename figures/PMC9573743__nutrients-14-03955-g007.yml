caption: 'TMAO induced bone loss in mice. (A) Representative micro-CT reconstruction
  images of femur from mice of control and TMAO groups. Scale bar = 400 µm. (B) Bone
  parameters of BMD, BV, BV/TV, Tb.N, and Tb.Th in the TMAO group were significantly
  lower than in the control group, and Tb.Sp in the TMAO group was significantly higher
  than in the control group (n = 4 per group). (C) Body weight of mice in the TMAO
  group was significantly higher than in the control group (n = 6 per group). (D)
  Representative images of HE staining of femur from mice of control and TMAO groups.
  Scale bar = 5 μm. (E) Representative images of TRAP staining of femur from mice
  of control and TMAO groups. TRAP-positive osteoclasts are marked by arrows. Scale
  bar = 5 μm. (F) TMAO significantly increased osteoclast number/bone surface area
  (N.Oc/BS) and osteoclast area/bone surface area (Oc.S/BS) observed by TRAP staining
  (n = 3 per group). * p < 0.05, #p < 0.01.'
