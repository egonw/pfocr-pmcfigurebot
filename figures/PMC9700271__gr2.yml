caption: Boolean decision in RTG signaling pathway(A) Logic gate analog for the RTG
  signaling pathway Rtg1p(left) and Rtg3p(right). Mitochondrial damage and the existence
  of Rtg1p, Rtg2p, and Rtg3p determined the translocation of Rtg1p into nucleus through
  a series of logic gate decisions (). The input is defined as 0 with knockout protein
  or absence of mitochondrial damage, and 1 represents the existence of a protein
  or mitochondrial damage. On the other hand, the output is defined as 1 with nucleus
  accumulation and 0 means no accumulation event. The solid line represents logic
  gate decision for nucleus accumulation, and the dotted line represents biological
  process that leads to retrograde response.(B) Boolean transformation of Rtg proteins
  nucleus translocation in healthy and damaged mitochondria. Simulated distribution
  of GFP-labeled Rtg1p under multiple conditions was compared to the Boolean model.
  The steady states of GFP proteins are listed by the cell icon labeled with nucleus
  (inner circle) and cytoplasmic (outer circle) concentration in arbitrary units.
  Localized concentrations are described as the summation of GFP-labeled proteins,
  including heterodimers. The relative quantity indicates the localized concentration-to-summation
  ratio, from 0 (gray) to 1 (green). To verify the result, simulated distributions
  are compared with the qualitative data of // () and  (). Nuclear accumulation is
  regarded as nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio is greater than 1.5. Simulation distribution
  of GFP-labeled Rtg1p(left) and GFP-labeled Rtg3p(right).
