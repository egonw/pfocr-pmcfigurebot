caption: hnRNPK knockdown by siRNA suppresses the growth of A549 xenograft tumors
  in vivo. (a) Schematic of the mouse xenograft model. (b) Size of tumors derived
  from si‐hnRNPK or si‐NC in four female nude mice/group are presented. (c) Tumor
  weight of the xenografts from the two groups. (d) Tumor volume of xenografts derived
  from the two groups were measured every 3 days and are presented as growth curves.
  (e) Bodyweight of the mice in the two groups at the indicated time‐points. Error
  bars represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
