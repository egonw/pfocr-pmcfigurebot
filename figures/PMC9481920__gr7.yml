caption: SETD4 epigenetically regulates quiescence of NSCs via multiple signaling
  pathways(A) Confocal images and quantification of the level of H3K9AC and H4K20ME3
  in NSCs in the SVZ of lateral ventricles in control and Setd4 overexpression mice
  after 3 day TAM induction. The white dotted circle line highlights the nuclear location
  of the higher magnification boxed area.(B) Heatmap of gene expression in primary
  adult SVZ NSCs after Setd4 overexpression using RNA-seq.(C) Volcano plot of total
  changed genes after Setd4 overexpression.(D and E) Heatmap of differentially expressed
  genes from top 30-folded-changed genes (D) and representative gene expression for
  NSC quiescence-maintaining, activation, and cell cycle (E) after Setd4 overexpression.(F
  and G) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (F) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
  Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis (G) after Setd4 overexpression.Nuclei
  were stained with DAPI (blue). LV, lateral ventricle. Data are represented as mean
  ± SEM. n = 3 mice were analyzed per experiment. Student’s t test.
