caption: Metabolic characteristics of PDAC associated with the ARF6-based pathway.
  The tumor microenvironment (TME) in PDAC is characterized by low vascular density,
  resulting in severe hypoxia and low nutrient levels. PDAC is also characterized
  by a dense desmoplastic stroma. In mammals, glucose and glutamine are two of the
  most abundant nutrients that support cell survival and growth. Oncogenic KRAS mutations
  induce metabolic reprogramming by triggering the uptake of glucose, leading to increased
  glycolytic flux, carbon donation to the pentose phosphate pathway and hexosamine
  biosynthetic pathway, and lactate production driving acidic TME. Glutamine is also
  used as an energy substrate in the TCA cycle, and maintains the intracellular redox
  state of PDAC cells in an oncogenic KRAS-driven manner. Double mutations of KRAS/p53
  cooperatively promote the expression and activation of the ARF6-AMAP1 pathway, and
  ARF6 is involved in maintaining the Warburg effect to meet the abnormal nutritional
  and energy demands of PDAC cells, as well as those required for autophogosome and
  macropinosome formation. Mutant p53 promotes ARF6 activation via the enhanced expression
  of mevalonate pathway enzymes, and also intracellular trafficking of ARF6 mediated
  by geranylgeranylation of RAB11b. TCA, tricarboxylic acid; HK-1/2, hexokinase-1/2;
