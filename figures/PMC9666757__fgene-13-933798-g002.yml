caption: Heatmaps, Venn plots, and enrichment analysis of GO and KEGG terms for the
  CESC dataset. (A and B) Heatmaps for the DEGs obtained from ImmuneScore (A) and
  StromalScore (B), generated by comparing high-scoring and low-scoring groups of
  immune and stromal cells. (C and D) Venn diagram analysis of up-regulated (C) and
  down-regulated (D) DEGs shared by the ImmuneScore and StromalScore. (E and F)Biological
  functions (E) and pathway (F) enrichment analyses for DEGs in the CESC dataset with
  p-value and q-value < 0.05.
