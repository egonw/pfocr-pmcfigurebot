caption: Metabolite set enrichment analysis (MSEA) prioritises known inherited metabolic
  disorder (IMD) biomarkers. (A) The row index distribution of all biomarker‐associated
  features are shown ranked by feature intensity (yellow), MSEA pathway p‐value (purple)
  and MSEA cluster p‐value (blue; see Section ). (B) An example patient (00057) with
  cystathionine ß‐synthase (CBS) deficiency is shown. The number of biomarker‐associated
  features in each category (significant features, yellow; significant features within
  an MSEA‐enriched pathway, purple; significant features within an MSEA cluster, blue)
  is indicated by a line. Along this line, biomarker‐associated features are shown;
  their position indicates where they rank in the feature distribution sorted as described
  in (A). (C) The same example patient (00057) with CBS deficiency is shown. Here
  the length of the line represents the number of pathways (purple) or clustered pathways
  (blue) and points represent the distribution of known biomarkers in these pathways
  ranked by pathway p‐value (purple) or cluster p‐value (blue, see Section ). (D)
  A pathway depicting what metabolites we found to be aberrant in a CBS deficiency
  patient, who were in close proximity to CBS. Bold metabolites are known biomarkers
  on IEMbase, underlined metabolites are part of our own metabolite panel, red metabolites
  have aberrant features associated to them in our data and metabolites in italics
  are false positive hits in the pathway as the associated aberrant feature was incorrectly
  annotated, see Table S4C–F for more details.
