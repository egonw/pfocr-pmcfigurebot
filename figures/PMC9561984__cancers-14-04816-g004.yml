caption: The effect of inhibiting signalling of the IL-1 pathway on growth of E0771
  cells in mammary glands and spontaneous metastasis to lung and bone (A) Protocol
  outline for orthotopic injection of E0771 cells into mammary glands and administration
  of PBS (control), MLX01, VX765 or Anakinra in mice. (B) Primary tumour volume following
  daily administration of PBS (control), MLX01, VX765 or Anakinra. (C) Survival curve
  (D) IVIS images of dissected femur/tibia ex vivo following exposure to D-luciferin
  for 5 min. (E) Percentage of mice that developed spontaneous bone metastasis and
  size of tumours in femurs/tibiae as assessed ex vivo by IVIS. (F) IVIS images of
  dissected lungs, ex vivo (G) Percentage of mice that developed spontaneous lung
  metastasis and size of tumours in lungs as assessed by IVIS, ex vivo. The graphs
  represent mean ± SD, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, **** p < 0.0001.
