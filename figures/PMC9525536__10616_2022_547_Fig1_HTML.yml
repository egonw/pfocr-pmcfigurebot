caption: Analysis of differentiation-inducing potential of Mc2-Ac-hex (HF). A Time
  and concentration dependence analysis of differentiation by Mc2-Ac-hex. NBT reduction
  assay was performed in a time-dependent manner at three different concentrations
  (10 µg/ml, 20 µg/ml, 40 µg/ml) of Mc2-Ac-hex (HF). B Minimum time required to induce
  differentiation of HL-60 cells by Mc2-Ac-hex (HF). The HL-60 cells were cultured
  in the presence of Mc2-Ac-hex (20 µg/ml) for the indicated time periods, followed
  by culturing in fresh medium without Mc2-Ac-hex (HF). The cells were scored for
  differentiation by NBT reduction assay at 96 h. C Flow cytometric analysis of CD11b
  positive HL-60 cells treated with Mc2-Ac-hex (HF) fraction, DMSO (1.2%, positive
  control) and VC (DMSO, 0.18%). The panel depicts a representative figure showing
  the overlay of the fluorescent cell population using PE-cy5 conjugated anti-CD11b
  antibodies at 96 h post-treatment. D The bar diagram shows the quantitative analysis
  of cells expressing CD11b, shown in panel (C). The data in all the panels represent
  the mean ± SD of three independent experiments, performed in triplicate. The significant
  difference between groups with respect to vehicle (0.18% DMSO) treated control cells
  (VC) were analyzed by ordinary One-way ANOVA (Dunnett’s multiple comparisons). **p ≤ 0.01;
  ***p ≤ 0.001
