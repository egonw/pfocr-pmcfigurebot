figure_title: JB activated the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway
caption: MKN45 cells were treated with or without the indicated concentrations of
  JB for 24 h. (A) The mitochondrial membrane potential disruption by JB in MKN45
  cells measured by flow cytometry (JC-1 staining). (B) Expression levels of apoptosis-related
  proteins including BAX, BCL-2, Cytochrome c (mitochondrial), Cleaved Caspase-9,
  Cleaved Caspase-3 were detected by western blotting. Data are expressed as means
  Â± SD of three independent experiments. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 compared with the control
  group.
