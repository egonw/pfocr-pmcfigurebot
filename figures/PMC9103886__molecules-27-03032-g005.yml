caption: Effect of n-3 PUFAs on the viability of HepG2 cells measured using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl
  tetrazolium bromide assay. Data were from at least three separate experiments. IC50
  for HepG2 cell line at 24 h was 900 μM. Cell viability in control groups were 100%
  * p < 0.05, compared with the control (0 μM) group.
