caption: 'The top schematic is a summary of oxidative stress mechanisms in neurological
  disorders. Under homeostatic conditions, Nrf2 binds with Keap1 and remains inactive.
  Nrf2-keap1 is also regulated by PI3K-Akt pathway. Under pathological conditions
  (neurological disorders) cause oxidative stress, Nrf2 and Keap1 will be separated.
  Nrf2 enters the nucleus and combines with MAF and ARE to activate antioxidant metabolic
  genes and play an antioxidant role. In addition, Nrf2 can activate GPX4 and be inhibited
  by Keap1. Both TCA cycle in mitochondria and Fenton reaction involving Fe2+ can
  cause oxidative stress by producing ROS. NAC, as a precursor of GPX4 and L-cysteine,
  affects oxidative stress through systemXCâˆ’ and GPX4. In addition, NAC can interfere
  with glutamate homeostasis and participate in the occurrence of a variety of nervous
  system diseases. NOX can produce ROS and cause oxidative stress under the action
  of a variety of regulatory factors. The bottom table is a summary of several molecules
  that affect oxidative stress in neurological disorders, including their action targets,
  action modes, and action results. Abbreviations: Akt: protein kinase B; ARE: antioxidant
  response element; ETC: electron transport chain; GPX4: glutathione peroxidase 4;
  Keap1: Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1; Maf: musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma
  oncogene homolog; NAC: N-acetylcysteine; NOX: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate oxidases; NADP: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; Nrf2: NF-E2-related
  factor 2; PI3K: phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase; ROS: reactive oxygen species; TCA:
  tricarboxylic acid.'
