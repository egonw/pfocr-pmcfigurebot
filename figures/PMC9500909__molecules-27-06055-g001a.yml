caption: (A) Composition of the plant cell wall. Arrangement of hydrophobic lignin
  and hydrophilic cellulose along with other cell wall structure components. (B) Value-added
  intermediate products synthesis from lignin. In step 1, the pretreatment of the
  lignocellulosic biomass occurs, separating cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin.
  The enzyme depolymerization of the lignin takes place in step 2, generating certain
  lignin-derived aromatics. The aromatics are hydrolyzed in step 3 through the microbial
  action of lignin-degrading white rot or bacteria, leading to the formation of key
  intermediates, including protocatechuate and catechol. The protocatechuate and catechol
  on further conversion and entering the Î²-ketoadipate pathway lead to value-added
  products like triglycerides.
