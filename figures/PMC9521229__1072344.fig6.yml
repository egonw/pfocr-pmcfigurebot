caption: Leucine polymer-loaded doxorubicin inhibits autophagy and reduces leukemic
  stem cell-enriched cells in acute myeloid leukemia mice. (A) Schematic of drug treatment
  and analysis. (B) Representative fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) plots
  of GFP+c-KIT+ cells (left) and GFP+Lin–Sca1–c-KIT+CD34+FcgRII/III+ cells (right,
  L-GMP) in the bone marrow (BM) of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) mice 2 days after
  indicated treatments. (C) The frequency of GFP+c-KIT+ cells (up) and GFP+Lin–Sca1–c-KIT+CD34+FcgRII/III+
  cells (down) in the BM of AML mice 2 days after indicated treatments (n=4 mice).
  (D) The absolute number of GFP+c-KIT+ cells (up) and GFP+Lin–Sca1–c-KIT+CD34+FcgRII/III+
  cells (down) in the BM of AML mice 2 days after indicated treatments (n=4 mice).
  (E) The apoptosis rate of GFP+c-KIT+ cells (up) and GFP+Lin–Sca1–c-KIT+CD34+FcgRII/III+
  cells (down) in the BM of AML mice 2 days after indicated treatments (n=4 mice).
  (F) Western blots (left) and quantification (right) of mTOR pathway, LC3B, and p62
  in GFP+c-KIT+ cells from AML mice 2 days after indicated treatment. 1#, 2#, 3# indicate
  3 individual AML mice.
