caption: GGA induced TRX in PAM212 cells in association with the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling
  pathway, ROS, and TXNIP. (A) PAM212 cells were pretreated with 50 μM of LY294002
  and 1 mM of NAC for 1 h, and then incubated with 1 μM of GGA for 24 h. The protein
  expression of p-Akt, Akt, and TRX was detected by Western blotting. (B) Intranuclear
  and extranuclear proteins were extracted from PAM212 cells, after the same treatment,
  using the Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Protein Extraction Kit (Beyotime Biotechnology),
  and the protein expression of Nrf2 was detected using Western blotting. (C) The
  knockdown effect of siNRF2 (1), siNRF2 (2), and siNRF2 (3) was verified using a
  real-time RT-PCR. (D) The selected PAM212 cells were transfected with siNRF2 (1)
  after treatment with or without 1 μM of GGA, and the protein expression of Nrf2,
  TRX, and TXNIP was detected using Western blotting. A grayscale analysis was performed
  using ImageJ 1.47v. (E) The mRNA expression of TRX1, TXNIP, and Nrf2 after 12 h
  treatment with 1 mM of PMA and 1 μM of GGA was detected using a real-time RT-PCR.
  Values are shown as the mean ± SD of three experiments (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001; one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey’s).
