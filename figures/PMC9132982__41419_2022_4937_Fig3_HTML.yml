figure_title: The relationship of EGFR expression and the sensitivity of BC cells
  to proguanil
caption: A–C The inhibitory effects of proguanil on proliferation and migration of
  T24 and J82 cell lines were compared by MTT, colony formation and transwell assay.
  D–F The inhibitory effects of proguanil on proliferation and migration of shCtrl,
  shEGFR-1 and shEGFR-2 cell lines were compared by MTT, colony formation and transwell
  assay. G–I The inhibitory effects of proguanil on proliferation and migration of
  OC-J82 and OE-J82 were compared by MTT, colony formation and transwell assay. See
  “Materials and methods” for more experimental details. Data are representative of
  three independent experiments. Error bars represent means ± SD from triplicate experiments.
  Vehicle control means the concentration of DMSO lower than 0.3% (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001).
