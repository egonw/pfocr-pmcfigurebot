caption: 'Effect of evodiamine on the expression of the anti- and pro-apoptotic molecules
  in AGS and MKN45 cells. Indicated doses of evodiamine (0, 1, 5, and 10 μM) for 24
  h were applied to (A) AGS and (B) MKN45 cells. A total of 10 μM evodiamine for the
  indicated time periods (0, 6, 12, 24 h) was applied to (C) AGS and (D) MKN45 cells.
  The cell lysates were subjected to Western blot to evaluate the levels of XIAP,
  survivin, Bax, and Bcl-2. β-actin was used as an internal control. (E,F) The intensity
  of Bax and Bcl-2 was normalized to β-actin and the ratio was calculated. Data are
  presented as the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments and analyzed by a Student’s
  t-test. ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001 vs. the non-treated control in AGS cells;
  # p < 0.05 and ### p < 0.001 vs. the non-treated control in MKN45 cells. EVD, evodiamine.'
