caption: 'Pretreatment with melatonin improved spatial learning and memory impairment
  after isoflurane exposure. (A) The schedule of four groups and behavioral tests.
  Isoflurane or drug treatment was performed 7 days after birth. MWM was performed
  on day 31–35 after birth. (B) The analysis of the time spent in each quadrant during
  the probe test of MWM (T: platform quadrant; L: left of platform quadrant; O: opposite
  to platform quadrant; R: right of platform quadrant. Quadrant: F(3,27) = 162.316,
  P = 0.431; Group: F(3,27) = 0.949, P < 0.001; Interaction: F(9,81) = 7.986, P <
  0.001). (C) Escape path length in MWM plotted against the training days (Time: F(4,36)
  = 227.969, P < 0.001; Group: F(3,27) = 48.628, P < 0.001; Interaction: F(12,108)
  = 2.4, P = 0.009). ∗denotes p < 0.05, Con vs Iso. #denotes p < 0.05, Iso vs Iso
  + M. (D) Escape latency in the Morris water maze plotted against the training days
  (Time: F(4,36) = 152.546, P < 0.001; Group: F(3,27) = 34.765, P < 0.001; Interaction:
  F(12,108) = 1.358, P < 0.001). ∗denotes p < 0.05, ∗∗denotes p < 0.01, Con vs Iso.
  #denotes p < 0.05, ##denotes p < 0.01, Iso vs Iso + M. (E) The platform crossing
  times during probe trial of MWM test (F(3, 36) = 5.157, P < 0.05). (F) Representative
  swim paths obtained during trial 3 (session 4) from rats in the four experimental
  group. Data were presented as mean ± SEM (n = 10). Two-way repeated measures ANOVA
  followed by a by post-hoc Tukey test (n = 10). ∗denotes p < 0.05 when comparing
  the two groups under each end of the capped line.'
