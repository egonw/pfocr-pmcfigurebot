caption: 'The c-Src pathway is mediated in apelin-induced migration and invasion of
  prostate cancer cells. (A–F,H,I) Cells were applied with the c-Src inhibitor (PP2;
  1 μM) or siRNA, then incubated with apelin, before examining cell migration (n =
  4) and invasion (n = 4), TIMP-2 and miR-106a-5p expression (n = 4). (G) PC3 cells
  were treated with apelin, then c-Src phosphorylation was investigated by Western
  blot (up-panel) and the quantify data were provide in low panel (n = 3). * p < 0.05
  compared with the control group; # p < 0.05 compared with the apelin-treated group.
  Dots of bar graph means the repeat number of Western blot assay.'
