caption: 'Artemisinin attenuated OGD/RP-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production
  and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) in PC12 cells. (A) Cells were
  pretreated with 25 μM artemisinin and then subjected to OGD/RP. Representative images
  of ROS levels and mitochondrial membrane potential. Scale bar: 100 μm. (B) Quantitative
  analysis of ROS levels. (C) Quantitative analysis of mitochondrial membrane potential.
  **p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001, versus ctrl group; # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, versus model
  group were considered significantly different. The assay was repeated at least 3
  times.'
