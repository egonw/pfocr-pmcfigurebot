caption: 'Hypothetical association between GERD and long‐term survival of small cell
  lung cancer (SCLC). Pathway 1: paraneoplastic endocrine hormone induces GERD while
  inhibiting SCLC. Pathway 2: PPI is an anti‐cancer drug. Pathway 3: paraneoplastic
  antibody causes GERD and increases curative effect of chemo‐ and radiation therapy.
  Abbreviations: GERD, gastroesophageal reflux disease; PPI, proton pump inhibitors;
  SCLC, small‐cell lung cancer'
