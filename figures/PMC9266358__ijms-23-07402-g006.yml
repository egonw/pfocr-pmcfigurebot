caption: 'Annotation analysis of KEGG pathway in different developmental stages of
  sweet cherries. (A) KEGG-enriched top 10 pathway analysis of DEGs between each comparison
  group. Select differential genes with p-values â‰¤ 0.5 for KEGG enrichment analysis;
  (B) association analysis of each pathway. Different dots indicate different metabolic
  pathways: gray indicates pathways that were associated with pathways but not enriched
  in the top 30 or not enriched; purple indicates pathways that were enriched into
  the top 30 at least in one set of comparison groups; blue circles indicate pathways
  that were enriched in the top 30 and more closely linked, at least in one comparison
  group. The bars in the blue circles represent the number of DEMs and DEGs in three
  different developmental stages, respectively, red represents the number of DEGs
  contained in the pathway, and blue represents the number of DEMs in the pathway.'
