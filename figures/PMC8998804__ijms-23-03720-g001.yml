caption: Oncogenic transcription factors and associated signaling pathways in gliomas.
  E2F TF is a downstream factor of the EGFR/PI3K/Akt pathway. The Rb tumor suppressor
  protein (pRb) binds to the E2F1 transcription factor, preventing it from interacting
  with the cell’s transcriptional machinery. When pRb gets phosphorylated, it detaches
  from E2F. E2F (along with its binding partner, TFDP) mediates the transactivation
  of E2F1 target genes, such as STAT3. GLI TF is a downstream effector of the Hedgehog
  pathway. In the absence of Hh, PTCH acts to prevent high expression and activity
  of SMO. GLI TFs function in a complex with Kif7 and Sufu, translocate to the nucleus,
  and induce the expression of target genes such as FoxM1. STAT3 TFs can be activated
  by several signals, which involve G-protein-coupled (GPCR) and cytokine receptors.
  Phosphorylated STAT3 homodimers regulate HIF-1α expression. FoxM1 can be activated
  by STAT3, GLI, HIF-1α, and E2F TFs. This figure was created with the tools provided
