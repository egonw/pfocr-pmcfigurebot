caption: Protein sequence alignments of BcGRP23 in flowering Chinese cabbage and other
  species. (A) Multiple sequence alignment performed using MEGA7 software. Amino acids
  with blue background are highly conserved. The sequences were markedly similar between
  Brassica rapa, Cucumis sativus, Brassica napa, Sinapis alba, Camelina sativa, and
  Arabidopsis thaliana. (B) Phylogenetic analysis of the glycine-rich protein (GRP)
  sequences of different plant species performed using the neighbor joining method
  in MEGA7, with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. Bo, B. oleracea; Bn, B. napus; Bc, B.
  campestris; Rs, Raphanus sativus.
