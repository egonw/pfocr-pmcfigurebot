figure_title: Functional characterization of mouse genes with interacting effects
caption: A. Frequency of mouse genes with statistically significant interactions by
  functional effect category (hippocampus and striatum). B. Network visualization
  of KEGG pathway enrichments for functional effect group b in striatum (largest category)
  providing insight into parent-child relationships of significantly enriched terms.
  For example, “spliceosome” and “chaperones and folding catalysts” can be seen to
  be most specifically as well as most significantly enriched. For context, all significantly
  enriched terms before correction for multiple testing are shown. Colors represent
  significant terms after multiple testing correction (hypergeometric test, FDR <
  0.05).
