caption: 'AN07 improved LPS-induced reduction of protein synthesis pathway in C2C12
  myotubes. Myotubes were pretreated with AN07 (0.01–1 μM) for 1 h followed by LPS
  (100 ng/mL) treatment for 24 h. The protein expressions of (A) IGF-1R, (B) IRS-1,
  (C) p-Akt/Akt, (D) p-mTOR (S2448)/mTOR, and (E) p-S6 (S235/236)/S6 were measured
  by Western blotting. (H) The IGF-1 mRNA expression was measured by qPCR. (F,G) For
  short-term LPS treatment, myotubes were pretreated with AN07 (0.01–1 μM) for 1 h
  followed by LPS (100 ng/mL) treatment for 12 h. The protein expressions of (F) p-mTOR
  (S2448)/mTOR and (G) p-S6 (S235/236)/S6 were measured by Western blotting. Densitometry
  analyses are presented as the relative ratio of protein/β-actin or p-protein/protein
  and are represented as percentages of the control group. Data represent the mean
  ± SEM from six independent experiments (n = 6). #p < 0.05 vs. control group (vehicle
  only); * p < 0.05 vs. LPS-treated group according to Kruskal–Wallis test followed
  by Dunn’s test.'
