caption: ZD6474 inhibits cell migration in TGF-β1-stimulated HTFs and HUVECs. Cell
  migration was evaluated by wound‑healing assay. a Representative images of the different
  treatment groups in TGF-β1-induced HTFs at 24 and 48 h after scratch. b Representative
  images of different treatment groups in HUVECs at 24 h after scratch. c Quantitative
  analyses of denuded area percentages (denuded area at the specified time point/denuded
  area at 0 h) after different treatments at different times in TGF-β1-induced HTFs
  and HUVECs. Data are presented as the means ± standard deviation of 3 independent
  repeats. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, vs. the TGF‑β1 or control group by one-way ANOVA
  followed by LSD test. Original magnification, × 4

  and inhibits neovascularization via AKT-mTOR signaling pathway.
