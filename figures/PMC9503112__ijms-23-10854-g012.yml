caption: Docking of the compounds 7b (a,b) and 7c (c,d) into the catalytic site of
  PI3Kα (a,c) and PI3Kγ (b,d). The gray dotted line is hydrophobic interactions, the
  blue solid line is hydrogen bonds, the light green dotted line is parallel π-π stacking,
  dark green dashed—normal π-π stacking. yellow dotted line—salt bridge. Pictures
  5E and 5F represent a superposition of 7b, 7c and Gedatolisib 8 in the catalytic
  site of PI3Kα (e) and PI3Kγ (f). Gedatolisib (8) is colored in blue, 7b—red and
  7c—green. Visualization of the docking results (protein-ligand complexes) was carried
  out using the PLIP service. The superposition of ligands was visualized via UCSF
  Chimera program.
