caption: Ablation of MALAT1 leads to inhibited proinflammatory response in peritoneal
  macrophages.A-C, LPS induced pro-inflammatory gene expression in wild type (MALAT1+/+)
  and MALAT1 ablated (MALAT1−/−) PM treated with LPS (5 μg/mL) determined by qRT-PCR.
  D-F, Pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the supernatant of PM isolated from MALAT1+/+
  and MALAT1−/− mice treated with LPS (5 μg/mL, 0–8 h). G, Cytokine levels from culture
  supernatant of PM treated with LPS (5 μg/mL, 8 h) from both MALAT1+/+ and MALAT1−/−
  mice were determined using mouse cytokine array. H, NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome
  signaling pathway in PM treated with LPS (5 μg/mL, 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6 h) from MALAT1+/+
  and MALAT1−/− mice. I and J, NLRP3 and Caspase1 gene expression level in MALAT1+/+
  and MALAT1−/− PM treated with LPS (5 μg/mL, 6 h) determined by qRT-PCR.

  and alleviates sepsis in mice.
