figure_title: ML effectively classifies lesional skin samples from DLE, PSO, AD, and
  SSc
caption: (A) ROC curve and (B) PR curve of lesional DLE, lesional PSO, lesional AD,
  and lesional SSc samples compared to pooled control samples using all cellular and
  pathway gene signatures. Top 15 features important in classifying (C) lesional DLE,
  (D) lesional PSO, (E) lesional AD, and (F) lesional SSc from pooled control samples
  using Gini feature importance. (G) Comparison of the top 15 features for classifying
  each lesional disease compared to control using Gini feature importance. (H) Classification
  metrics to properly separate lesional DLE, lesional PSO, lesional AD, or lesional
  SSc and control samples using all 48 (top) or the top 15 (bottom) cellular and pathway
  gene signatures. Refer to table S3 (A and B) for ML details. Collinear features
  were removed (fig. S6).
