caption: C-Kit and Slug form a positive-feedback signaling axis in CRC, which is a
  target of bufalin’s anti-stemness activity. (A) GeneMANIA network analysis showing
  that C-Kit (KIT) and Slug (SNAI2) are pathway interactors. (B) Correlation analysis
  from TCGA’s COADREAD RNA-Seq dataset demonstrating that the mRNA expression of C-Kit
  and Slug are positively correlated (Pearson r = 0.3704, p < 0.0001). (C) Immunoblotting
  results confirming that C-Kit is strongly downregulated following 20 or 40 nM bufalin
  treatment in HCT116, DLD1 and SW480 cell lines. (D) Overexpression of C-Kit (OE-C-Kit)
  in the SW480 cell line results in up-regulation of Slug, increased matrigel spheroid
  formation capacity at baseline (~50% increase; p < 0.05), and resistance to bufalin’s
  anti-stemness activity as evidenced by an approximately 50% reduction in vector
  control spheroids (SW480 Ctrl; p < 0.01) compared to a <20% reduction in OE-C-Kit
  spheroids (SW480 OE-C-Kit; NS). (E) Slug over-expression (OE-Slug) in the DLD1 cell
  line results in upregulation of C-Kit and ALDH1A1, increased matrigel spheroid formation
  capacity at baseline (>100% increase; p < 0.05), and resistance to bufalin’s anti-stemness
  activity as evidenced by an approximately 66% reduction in vector control spheroids
  (DLD1 Ctrl; p < 0.05) compared with a statistically insignificant reduction in OE-C-Kit
  spheroids (DLD1 OE-C-Kit; NS). (*p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, NS = Not Significant).
