caption: Volcano plot of genes in the KEGG Ribosome and KEGG Cell Cycle sets in new-onset
  JDM cells compared to healthy pediatric controls and qRT-PCR validation of select
  Ribosome genes in treatment-naïve JDM patients vs age-matched controls (AMC). (A)
  Genes in the KEGG Ribosome (hsa03010) and Cell Cycle pathway (hsa04110) in JDM NK,
  T, and B cells compared to AMC. The Ribosome pathway has many ribosomal proteins
  while the Cell Cycle pathway contains genes involved in regulation of cell proliferation
  (listed in ). Red dots indicate an adjusted P value of < 0.05 and blue dots indicate
  an adjusted P value of > 0.05. (B) qRT-PCR conformation of select genes in the KEGG
  Ribosome (hsa03010) pathway in JDM NK, T, and B cells compared to pediatric controls.
  deltaCT (dCT) was determined by CT of B2M – target CT.
