caption: Ischemia-reperfusion injury induced a significant increasing expression of
  HMGB1, TLR4 and NF-κB, accompanied by a high number of neutrophils. Ac2-26 could
  inhibit the activation of HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway and decrease neutrophil
  infiltration, thereby alleviate the ischemia-reperfusion induced hepatocytes damage.
  HMGB1, high mobility group box protein 1; TLR4, Toll-like receptor 4.

  the positive feedback loop of HMGB1/TLR4/NF‑κB/neutrophils.
