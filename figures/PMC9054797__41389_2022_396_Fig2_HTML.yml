figure_title: NSE promotes SCLC tumor growth in vitro and in vivo
caption: The cell proliferation capability was assessed using the CCK8 assay. A Overexpression
  of NSE promoted the cell proliferation capability of H446 cells. B Knockdown of
  NSE repressed cell proliferation of H69 cells. C NSE overexpression promoted the
  colony-formation capability of SCLC cells. D Colonies were stained with crystal
  violet, and the number of colonies was counted and shown in a column diagram. Error
  bars represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. E Silencing of NSE
  inhibited the colony-formation capability of SCLC cells. F The number of colonies
  was counted and is shown in a column diagram. Error bars represent mean ± SD from
  three independent experiments. G–I Overexpression of NSE promotes tumor growth in
  vivo. G The tumor growth curves were compared between NSE overexpression cells,
  empty vector cells, and untransduced cells. H The images showed the macroscopic
  appearance of tumors resected from NSE overexpression or control tumors. I The image
  showed the statistical analyses of the tumor weights. J–L Silencing NSE inhibited
  the tumor-initiating capability of SCLC cells. J The tumor growth curves are shown.
  K The images show the macroscopic appearance of tumors resected from NSE silencing
  cells or negative control tumors. L The image shows the statistical analyses of
  the tumor weights. Data are represented as mean ± SD for three experiments. *P < 0.05;
  **P < 0.01.
