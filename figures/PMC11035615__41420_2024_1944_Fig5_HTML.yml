figure_title: MED15 promoted activation of the SREBP pathway
caption: A Downregulated lipid metabolism genes identified in transcriptome sequencing
  data of OS-RC-2 cells with MED15 knockdown. B Functional protein association networks
  for these downregulated lipid metabolism genes were constructed in the STRING database.
  C, D Western blot assays showed decreased protein levels of SREBP1, SREBP2, PLK1
  and SREBP-dependent lipid biosynthesis enzymes (FASN, ACC1, ACLY, and SCD1) in RCC
  cells with MED15 knockdown. E, F Western blot assays showed increased protein levels
  of SREBP1, SREBP2, PLK1 and SREBP-dependent lipid biosynthesis enzymes (FASN, ACC1,
  ACLY, and SCD1) in RCC cells overexpressing MED15. G, H PLK1 knockdown eliminated
  the effects of MED15 overexpression on SREBP1 and SREBP2 expression. The results
  are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). “ns” indicates P > 0.05; *
  indicates P < 0.05; ** indicates P < 0.01; *** indicates P < 0.001; **** indicates
  P < 0.0001.
