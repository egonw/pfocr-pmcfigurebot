caption: P2RY13 promotes IL-6-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation.
  (A) NCM460 cells were preincubated with 10 uM of MRS2211 for 1h before being treated
  with LPS (1 ug/ml) for 24 h. At 24h after the stimulation of LPS, Western blotting
  was performed to measure the levels of STAT3, p-STAT3, ZO-1, Occludin, Bcl-2 and
  Bax. (B) NCM460 cells were preincubated with 10 uM of MRS2211 for 1 h before being
  treated with IL-6 (20 ng/ml) for 12 h. At 12hr after the stimulation of IL-6, Western
  blotting was performed to measure the levels of STAT3, p-STAT3, ZO-1, Occludin,
  Bcl-2 and Bax. (C) Confocal microscopy showing changes in subcellular localization
  of STAT3 in the NCM460 cells were preincubated with 10 uM of MRS2211 before being
  treated with LPS. The immunostained (× 600) with STAT3 (red) and DAPI (blue). (D)
  NCM460 cells transfected with P2RY13-targeting siRNA (siP2RY13-2) or nontargeting
  siRNAs (siNC) and stimulated with LPS, Confocal microscopy showing changes in subcellular
  localization of STAT3.The immunostained (× 600) with STAT3 (red) and DAPI (blue).
  (E) NCM460 cells were preincubated with 10 uM of MRS2211 before being treated with
  LPS, Western blotting was performed to measure the levels of STAT3 of nucleus. (F)
  NCM460 cells transfected with P2RY13-targeting siRNA (siP2RY13-2) or nontargeting
  siRNAs (siNC) and stimulate with LPS, Western blotting was performed to measure
  the levels of STAT3, P2RY13 of nucleus. (G) Confocal microscopy showing the expression
  of P-STAT3 in the NCM460 cells were preincubated with 10 uM of MRS2211 before being
  treated with LPS. The immunostained with P-STAT3 (red) and DAPI (blue). (H) NCM460
  cells transfected with P2RY13-targeting siRNA (siP2RY13-2) or nontargeting siRNAs
  (siNC) and stimulated with LPS, Confocal microscopy showing the expression of P-STAT3.The
  immunostained with P-STAT3 (red) and DAPI (blue). (I) Immunohistochemical (× 200)
  of the p-STAT3 protein in colonic tissues from WT mice were treated with or without
  4% DSS for 8 days and injected intraperitoneally with PBS or MRS2211 (1 mg/kg) daily
  from day 1 to day 7. (J) Representative micrographs of immunohistochemical staining
  (× 200) of STAT3 and P2RY13 in matched specimens of human ulcerative colitis. Insets
  show staining of specimens in more detail. (K) Statistical analysis of Spearman's
  correlation between immunohistochemistry staining scores of P2RY13 expression and
  STAT3 nuclear localization. P2RY13 staining was scored according to immune response
  scores (IRSs). STAT3 staining was quantified by nuclear localization as scores of
  0 (<10%), 1 (10%-20%), 2 (20%-40%), 3 (40%-60%), 4 (60%-80%) or 5 (>80%). Data represent
  the means ± SEMs. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001.
