caption: 'Mechanism of actions of novel agents targeting epigenetic regulators. (A)
  Removal of methyl groups by LSD1, inhibiting p53 methylation and abrogating cellular
  apoptosis. LSD1 inhibitor antagonizes LSD1 to restore tumor-suppressive effects
  of p53. (B) Anchoring of BET proteins to acetylated lysine residues to activate
  NF-κB pathway. BET inhibitors block BET proteins and the proinflammatory pathway
  to reduce synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines. (C) Removal of acetyl groups by
  HDAC, decreasing tumor-suppressor gene transcription while deacetylating HSP to
  aggravate JAK/STAT signaling pathway. This effect can be overcome by HDAC inhibitors.
  (D) Aberrant phosphorylation of PRMT5 by JAK2V617F, leading to impaired methylation
  activity. Thus, E2F is methylation for cell cycle progression and myeloproliferation.
  The aberrant activation can be inhibited by an PRMT5 inhibitor. Me: methylation;
  Ac: acetylation; LSD1: lysine-specific demethylase-1; BET: bromodomain and extraterminal
  domain; NF-κB: nuclear factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells; HDAC:
  histone deacetylase; TS genes: tumor suppressor genes; HSP: heat shock protein;
  JAK: Janus kinase; STAT: signal transducer and activator of transcription; PRMT5:
  protein arginine methyltransferase 5; E2F: E2F transcription factor 1.'
