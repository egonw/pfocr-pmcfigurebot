caption: 'Effect of 0% RSV-PCL (PCL) and 10% RSV-PCL (RSV-PCL) electrosprayed microparticles
  on the NF-κB signaling pathway. Immunocytochemistry (A) and complementary relative
  fluorescence intensity (B) analysis of the NF-κB subunit p65 localization illustrated
  that TNF-α stimulation (50 ng/mL) induced significant (p < 0.05) nuclear translocation
  of p65 (indicative of NF-κB activation) after 24 h (n = 3. p65: green, F-actin:
  red, Nuclei: blue. Scale bars: 50 μm). The 10% RSV-PCL microparticles did not robustly
  prevent or reverse nuclear translocation of the NF-κB subunit p65, even though a
  minor effect was noted (p < 0.05). * indicates a statistically significant difference
  between all groups (p < 0.05). # indicates statistically significant to CTRL + TNF-α
  group (p < 0.05). Individual values (n = 15 images per group) are displayed as dots
  on bar charts. Error bars represent mean ± SD. Generalized linear models and bootstrap-t-tests.'
