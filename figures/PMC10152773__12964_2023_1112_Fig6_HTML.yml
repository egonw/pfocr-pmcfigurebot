caption: 'The hypoxic microenvironment induced NET formation through the TLR4/p38
  MAPK pathway in neutrophils. A, The mRNA expression of TLR2, TLR4, TLR9 and RAGE
  in neutrophils treated with hypoxic-CM from GC cells was measured by qRT‒PCR. B,
  Neutrophils isolated from healthy individuals were pretreated with inhibitors of
  TLR2, TLR4, TLR9 and RAGE for 1 h prior to coculture with hypoxic-CM from GC cells,
  and the p-p38 level in neutrophils was measured by western blotting. C, NET formation
  was detected with MPO and citH3 staining. Magnification: 20 × . Scale bars: 50 μm.
  All values are the means ± SDs. ns = not significant, **P < 0.01'
