caption: 'NAA10 inhibits RelA/p65‐activated transcriptional expression of Pirh2. (A)
  NAA10 cooperated with RelA/p65 to regulate Pirh2 expression in luciferase assay.
  (B) According to transcription factor RelA/p65 binding sites in the Pirh2 promoter:
  site 1 (Pirh2p1), −1393 to −1384; and site 2 (Pirh2p2), −926 to −917; and site 3
  (Pirh2p3), −10 to +1. Truncated Pirh2 promoter constructs were established. (C)
  Truncated Pirh2 promoter constructs were transfected to CAL 27 cells, respectively,
  and relative luciferase activities were determined. (D) CHIP‐qPCR assay demonstrated
  the direct binding of RelA/p65 to the Pirh2 promoter. Collective results were carried
  out in triplicate. The bars represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
