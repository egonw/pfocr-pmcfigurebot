caption: Major biological activities and their mechanisms of action of stilbenes in
  Dendrobium species. Anti-oxidant (inhibiting lipid peroxidation, increasing SOD,
  GPx and CAT activity); Anti-inflammatory (through inhibition of expression of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, blockage of NF-κB activation and phosphorylation
  of MAP kinases, inhibiting the JNK/cPLA2/12-LOX pathway); Anti-α-glucosidase (through
  inhibition α-glucosidase and pancre-atic lipase, suppression of PPARγ and C/EBPα
  expression); Anti-cancer (through inhibition cancer cell viability, migration and
  invasion, tumor angiogenesis, cell proliferation and increasing cell apoptosis)
  activities.
