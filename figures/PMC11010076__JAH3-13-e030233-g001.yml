figure_title: Assessment of potential intermediaries on the pathway connecting major
  depressive disorder and PAD
caption: Forest plot displaying estimates of the association between the genetic liability
  for major depressive disorder and genetically inferred cardiovascular disease risk
  factors (A) and genetically inferred cardiovascular disease risk factors and genetic
  liability for PAD (B). Results are from the primary analysis using inverse variance
  weighted 2‐sample Mendelian randomization to evaluate the relationship between known
  cardiovascular disease risk factors and our exposure and outcome. The number of
  single‐nucleotide polymorphisms in the instrument, OR, 95% CIs, and P values are
  displayed for Mendelian randomization estimates. A, The effect estimate (β) represents
  the effect of a 1 log‐odds (2.7‐fold) increase in the liability for the exposure
  on the outcomes, as expressed in SDs. B, The effect estimate (OR) represents the
  effect of a 1 log‐odds (2.7‐fold) increase in the liability for the exposure on
  the outcome. BMI indicates body mass index; IVW, inverse variance weighted; MDD,
  major depressive disorder; OR, odds ratio; PAD, peripheral artery disease; and SNP,
  single‐nucleotide polymorphism.
