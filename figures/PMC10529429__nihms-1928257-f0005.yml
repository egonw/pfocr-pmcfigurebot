figure_title: Insulin overexpression in CP affects hypothalamic transcriptome
caption: Hypothalamuses of animals injected i.c.v. with either AAV5-CMV-GFP or AAV5-CMV-Ins2
  were collected, and total RNA was processed for transcriptome analysis (bulk RNA
  sequencing).(A) Three-dimensional (3D) principal-component analysis shows clustering
  of our samples, corresponding to our two experimental conditions.(B) Volcano plot
  of gene expression values compared between groups reveals the presence of 1,714
  differently expressed genes. Genes of interest that have higher expression values
  in our experimental group are emphasized in red, while lower expressed genes of
  interest are emphasized in blue.(C) Heatmap of the 80 most differently expressed
  genes shows clear clustering of samples in accordance with their respective treatment.
  In red are genes upregulated and in blue genes that are downregulated.(D) Upregulated
  GO terms of biological function associated with differently expressed genes are
  mostly related to synapse remodeling processes.(E) The 20 most significantly enhanced
  IPA canonical pathways reveal strong upregulation of synaptogenesis signaling pathway.
  Other pathways of interest include opioid and GABA signaling.
