caption: Pretreatment with CC partially reverses the effect of Rg1 on the viability
  of ox-LDL-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells. (A) CCK-8 assay was used
  to detect cell viability. (B) TUNEL assay was employed to detect apoptosis (magnification,
  x200). (C) Quantified proportion of apoptotic cells. (D and E) Western blot analysis
  was used to detect the expression of apoptosis-related proteins. *P<0.05, **P<0.01,
  ***P<0.001. ox-LDL, oxidized low-density lipoprotein; Rg1, ginsenoside Rg1; CC,
  compound C.
article_title: Ginsenoside Rg1 ameliorates apoptosis, senescence and oxidative stress
  in ox-LDL-induced vascular endothelial cells via the AMPK/SIRT3/p53 signaling pathway.
