caption: Amplification of interleukin (IL)‐17A signalling pathway by miR‐378a in keratinocytes.
  Our findings suggest a model in which miR‐378a is induced by IL‐17A via nuclear
  factor kappa B (NF‐κB), C/EBP‐β and IκBζ in keratinocytes. Induction of miR‐378a
  leads to the suppression of NFKBIA/IκBα, which allows for activation of the NF‐κB
  pathway including the nuclear translocation of p65, leading to further induction
  of inflammatory mediators such as IL‐8/CXCL8 and CCL20. The baseline intracellular
  level of miR‐378a may regulate the magnitude of the response to triggers activating
  the NF‐κB‐pathway. [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]
