caption: 'Plasma levels of spermine and ornithine differ between control and delirium.
  Spermine (A) and ornithine (B) concentrations (μM) in pre- and post-op samples.
  Spermine (C) and ornithine (D) concentrations (μM) in pre- and post-op samples with
  control and delirium. (E) shows the relevant metabolic pathway where ornithine is
  converted into spermine by the action of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC1). * p < 0.05,
  *** p < 0.001 for both pre- and post-op and pre- and post-op with control and delirium
  for each group. Pre-op: preoperative; Post-op: postoperative; Pre-ctrl: preoperative
  control; Pre-del: preoperative delirium; Post-ctrl: postoperative control; Post-del:
  postoperative delirium.'
