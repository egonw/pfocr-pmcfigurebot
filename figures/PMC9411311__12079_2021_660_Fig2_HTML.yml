caption: GM inhibits phosphorylation of proximal signaling molecules involved in TCR
  signaling. a Coomassie brilliant blue staining of all the samples showing equal
  protein loading. b Western blot analysis of phosphorylation status of signaling
  proteins involved in proximal T cell receptor signal transduction pathway in T cells
  incubated with GM peptide. When stimulated with CD3/CD28 antibody, there was an
  increase in phosphorylation of signaling molecules ( +) compared to unstimulated
  cells (-). Pre-incubation of cells with the TAT peptide alone did not affect the
  increase in phosphorylation (T), whereas pre-incubation with GM peptide at 250 and
  500 µM completely inhibited CD3/CD28-mediated phosphorylation of the signaling molecules
  (GM 1X and GM 2X)
