caption: 'Effects of CHDT on the lean mass and muscle mass of mice with Dex-induced
  muscle atrophy. (A) Body composition images obtained using DXA analysis. Lean tissue
  is shown in green, fat in red, and bone in white. The lean mass of the mice was
  measured twice: before the start of the study and at the end of the period of administration
  (on day 30). (B) Lean mass and (C) lean percentage in the ROI, which surrounds the
  mouse hindlimbs. (D) At the end of the study, representative images of the quadriceps
  (QUA, top) and gastrocnemius (GAS, bottom) muscles were taken. The scale of one
  grid is 1 mm. (E) Masses of the QUA (left) and GAS (right) muscles, normalized to
  the most recently measured body mass. Different letters indicate statistically significant
  differences; p < 0.05, a > b > c.'
