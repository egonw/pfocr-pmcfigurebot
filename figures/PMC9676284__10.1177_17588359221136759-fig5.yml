caption: scRNA-seq of PSC. (a) UMAP plot of 5064 cells from two patients with PSC
  and two patients with adenocarcinoma and major cell-type composition of each patient.
  (b) UMAP plot of immune cells and cell-type composition of each patient. (c) ITH
  scores based on CNAs (ITHCNA) and gene expressions (ITHGEX). (d) The top 5 enriched
  pathway of GSEA of cancer cells. (e) Antigen receptor-mediated signaling pathway
  was upregulated in PSC while basement membrane organization pathway was upregulated
  in adenocarcinoma. (f). The top 5 enriched pathway of GSEA of T cells, including
  na√Øve T cells, CD8+ effector T cells, proliferating CD8+ effector T cells and regulatory
  T cells and (g). GO analyses of T cells.AD, adenocarcinoma; GSEA, gene set enrichment
  analysis; ITH, intratumoral heterogeneity; PSC, pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma;
  scRNA-seq, single-cell RNA sequencing.
