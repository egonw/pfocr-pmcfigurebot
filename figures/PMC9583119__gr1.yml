caption: OAS3 inhibits EV71 replication depending on RNase L activation. 2-5A synthesis
  activity of OAS3 determines the inhibitory effect on EV71 replication.A WT and inactivated
  mutants of OAS3 transfected HEK293T cells were infected with EV71 at an MOI of 4.
  The expression levels of exogenous OAS3 and VP1 were examined by Western blotting.
  B Viral RNA in cell lysate was examined by RT-qPCR. The RNA level of VR1012 was
  set as “1”. C Viral titers in the supernatants were determined by the plaque assay.
  D RNase L activation was examined by agarose electrophoresis of total rRNA of cells.
  E The negative control pLKO.1 and RNase L knockdown (RNase L KD) HEK293T cells were
  transfected with OAS3-expressing or control plasmids. Cells were infected with EV71
  at an MOI of 4. The expression levels of endogenous RNase L, exogenous OAS3, and
  VP1 were examined by Western blotting. F Viral RNA in cell lysate was examined by
  RT-qPCR. The RNA level of VR1012 was set as “1”. G Viral titers in the supernatants
  were determined by the plaque assay. H RNase L activation was examined by agarose
  electrophoresis of total rRNA of cells. The results represent the means ​± ​standard
  deviation from three independent experiments. Statistical significance was analyzed
  using Student's t-test (# no significance, ∗∗P ​< ​0.01).
