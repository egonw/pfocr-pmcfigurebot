caption: 'CXCL8 protects endothelial cells from erastin-induced ferroptosis. (a,b).
  Western blotting was performed to check the expression of NF-κB p65 and p-p65 in
  PUMC-HUVEC-T1 cells with CXCL8 treatment alone (50 ng/mL for 24 h), erastin treatment
  alone (10 μM for 24 h) or in combination (a), and the CXCR2 knockdown cells with
  erastin treatment alone (10 μM for 24 h) or in combination with CXCL8 treatment
  (50 ng/mL for 24 h) (b). Quantitation (n = 3, bottom panels) of protein expression
  was conducted based on integrated density measured by ImageJ. (c–f). GSH/GSSG ratios
  (c), ROS levels (d), Lipid ROS (e), and relative cell viability % (f) were measured
  in PUMC-HUVEC-T1 cells with the indicated treatment alone or in combination. CXCL8
  treatment: 50 ng/mL for 24 h; erastin treatment: 10 μM for 24 h. (g–i). Lipid ROS
  production was assessed by flow cytometry using C11-BODIPY. n.s., not significant;
  *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001.'
