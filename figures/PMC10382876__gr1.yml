caption: Gene regulatory network construction and control hubs of complex networks(A)
  Construction of a gene regulatory network, GRN. Ten control-related gene/protein
  interaction types were extracted from five high-quality pathway databases. A breadth-first
  search was then performed, starting from 45 known BLCA driver genes and the 50 most
  highly mutated genes of BLCA. The traversed nodes and edges constitute GRN.(B) An
  example of a simple network with three different maximum matchings. The unmatched
  nodes are driver nodes, and the red edges are matched edges.(C) Two different control
  schemes of a simple network. A node may lie at the head, tail, or middle of a control
  path. Node e resides in the middle of some control paths of the two control schemes,
  becoming a control hub of the network.(D) Sensitive control hubs of a simple network.
  After removing edge e(5,4), node 5 changes from a control hub to a tail node, making
  it a sensitive control hub of the network.
