caption: Pyroptosis patterns and relevant biological pathway for each pattern. (A)
  Unsupervised clustering of 30 PRGs in the six CC cohorts. The PPSclusters and cohortsâ€™
  names were used as patient annotations. Each column represented patients and each
  row represented PRGs. (B) Unsupervised clustering analysis of CC patients from 6
  GEO cohorts (GSE39582, GSE38832, GSE37892, GSE33113, GSE29621 and GSE17536) resulted
  in three pyroptosis patterns. Kaplan-Meier curves of relapse-free survival for CC
  patients in the meta-GEO cohort with different pyroptosis patterns. (C, D) The heatmaps
  were used to visualize the gene set variation analysis score of representative biological
  pathways in distinct pyroptosis patterns. The color of orange represented activated
  pathways and blue represented inhibited pathways. The CC cohorts were used as sample
  annotations. PPScluster-1 vs. PPScluster-3 (C) and PPScluster-1 vs. PPScluster-2
  (D).
