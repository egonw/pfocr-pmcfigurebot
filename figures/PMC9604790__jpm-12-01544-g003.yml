caption: 'Schematic of the Hippo pathway and YAP/TAZ regulatory components in HNSCC.
  When the Hippo pathway is active, activated LATS1/2 phosphorylates YAP/TAZ at multiple
  serine residues, leading to its cytoplasmic retention or degradation. When Hippo
  is inactive, dephosphorylated YAP/TAZ translocates to the nucleus, binds to TEAD,
  and enhances transcription of growth-related genes. Genetic alterations including
  FAT1, EGFR, VAV2, TIMP-1, HPV (E7), ARID1A, BRD4, LSD1, AP-1, CDK7, and YAP1 are
  involved in aberrant YAP/TAZ activation. Abbreviations are: Rac family small GTPase
  1 (RAC1), Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMK2), and scribble homolog
  (SCRIB).'
