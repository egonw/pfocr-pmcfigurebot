caption: Functional enrichment analysis and interaction of key DEGs. (A) PPI network
  of key DEGs. (B) Key modules in the PPI network. The lines indicate the interaction
  between the DEGs. (C) GO enrichment bars for key DEGs. The ordinate indicates the
  enriched GO term, the length of the bars indicates the number of DEGs, and the colour
  from blue to red indicates the confidence from low to high. (D) Bubble chart of
  KEGG functional enrichment for key DEGs. The ordinate indicates the enrichment KEGG
  pathway, the bubble size indicates the number of DEGs, and the colour from blue
  to red indicates the confidence from low to high.
