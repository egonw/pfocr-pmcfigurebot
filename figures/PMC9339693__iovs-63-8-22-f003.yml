caption: 'Fasudil increased Cx43 expression in retinal endothelial cells and alleviated
  retinal endothelial cell injury induced by high glucose. (A) Immunofluorescence
  staining of Cx43 (green) and CD31 (red) and DAPI staining (blue) in retinal tissue
  sections. Scale bar: 20 µm. (B) Immunofluorescence staining of Cx43 (green), GFAP
  (red), and DAPI staining (blue) of retinal tissue sections. Scale bar: 20 µm. (C)
  PAS staining of the retinal capillary network. The arrows indicate acellular capillaries.
  Acellular capillaries were counted in six random fields per retinal flat mount.
  Scale bar: 50 µm. (D) Mice were perfused with EB for two hours. The fluorescence
  intensity in the retinal flat mounts was measure by immunofluorescence confocal
  microscopy and graphical illustration of quantified EB leakage. ***P < 0.001, ****P
  < 0.0001 versus the control group; #P < 0.05, ####P < 0.0001 versus the DR group.
  N = 3. The bars are the mean ± SD.'
