caption: Cx32 predicts poor prognosis in HCC patients. (A-D) Survival analysis of
  the Cx32 gene in patients with HCC based on TCGA database. Survival is expressed
  as OS, DSS, DFI and PFI. (E) Immunohistochemical detection of the expression level
  of Cx32 in HCC specimens and corresponding PT. Magnification, Ã—200. (F) Rate of
  positive expression of Cx32 in HCC specimens and PT. (G) Kaplan-Meier survival plots
  for all HCC patients with positive expression of Cx32 and negative expression of
  Cx32. Log rank testing was used to analyze the data; P<0.05. Cx32, connexin 32;
  HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas; OS, overall survival;
  DSS, disease-specific survival; DFI, disease-free interval; PFI, progression-free
  interval; PT, paracarcinoma tissues.
