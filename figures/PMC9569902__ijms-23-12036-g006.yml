caption: RAI14 knockdown inhibits tumor growth and improved prognosis in mice. (A)
  The effect of knockdown RAI14 on the colony-forming ability of melanoma cells was
  detected by soft agar assay. (B,C) Volume and weight of xenograft tumors were counted
  and analyzed. (D,E) The expressions of RAI14, Ki67, c-MYC and FBXO32 were detected
  by immunohistochemical staining. (F) A model of the regulatory mechanism of RAI14
  in melanoma. The data were expressed as mean ± SD. Student’s t test was performed
  to analyze significance. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
