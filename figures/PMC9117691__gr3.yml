caption: Knockdown of MSI2 suppressed the migration and invasion of NSCLC cells by
  activating the JAK2/STAT3 signalling pathway. (A) Western blotting assay of MSI2
  expression in human NSCLC cell lines (H1975, H460, A549, H520 and NCI-1299) and
  normal pulmonary epithelium cell (16HBE). (B) The mRNA and protein expression of
  MSI2 in A549 and H520 cells transfected with si-NC and si-MSI2, as determined via
  reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and Western blotting, respectively. (C) Cell
  proliferation, (D) colony formation, (E) migration (scale bar, 500 µm) and (F) invasion
  assays (scale bar, 200 µm) were performed using A549 and H520 cells transfected
  with si-MSI2. (G) Western blotting analysis of the expression of JAK2/STA3 signalling
  pathway markers in A549 and H520 cells transfected with si-MSI2. The results were
  obtained from four independent experiments and are expressed as the mean ± SD. *P<0.05,
  ⁎⁎P<0.01, ⁎⁎⁎P<0.001. MSI2, Musashi-2; p-, phosphorylated; WASF3, Wiskott-Aldrich
  syndrome protein family member 3; NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer; si-, small
  interfering RNA; NC, negative control.
