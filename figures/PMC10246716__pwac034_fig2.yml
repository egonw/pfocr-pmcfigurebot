caption: 'Enhanced accumulation of gangliosides and attenuated lysosomal function
  in Mfsd12-deficient mice. (A) TLC results showing the relative amounts of gangliosides
  GM1–3 in intestinal lysosomes from WT and CKO mice. WCL, whole-cell lysate; Cyto.,
  cytosolic fraction. Lyso., lysosome. (B) The identified ganglioside species and
  the relative amounts of ganglioside species corresponding to the labeled bands (A)
  are shown. (C–D) Representative chromatograms (C) and high-resolution MS spectra
  (D) showing the identified ganglioside species. (E) Relative contents of GM1, GM2,
  and GM3 in the intestinal WCL and lysosome fractions from WT and CKO mouse detected
  by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry: n = 6 mice. (F) Representative electron
  microscopy (EM) images showing the effect of Mfsd12 deficiency on lysosome phenotypes
  of mouse intestine. Scale bars, 1 μm. (G) Effect of Mfsd12 deficiency on lysosomal
  function. (H) Immunoblots showing the effect of Mfsd12 deficiency on autophagy markers
  and TFEB signaling in the intestine from WT and CKO mice. (I) Effect of Mfsd12 deficiency
  on the pH of intestinal lysosomes from WT and CKO mice. (J) Effect of pH on cysteine
  transport by MFSD12 PM in HEK293T cells. MFSD12 PM (L253A/L254A) is a plasma membrane-localized
  mutant of MFSD12. n = 3. (K) Effect of cysteine transport on cellular pH in HEK293T
  cells. (L) MFSD12 transports cysteine into the lysosomes with H+ export from the
  lysosomes. This maintains lysosome homeostasis via the mTOR–TFEB-mediated pathway
  and thereby modulates the catabolism of glycosphingolipids. Mfsd12 deficiency abolishes
  cysteine import into the lysosomes and attenuates H+ export from the lysosomes.
  This affects TFEB-mediated lysosome homeostasis by activating mTOR and inactivating
  TFEB, and results in accumulation of gangliosides in the lysosomes. Data are shown
  as mean ± SEM. Comparison of different groups was carried out by using Student’s
  t-test (E) or two-way ANOVA (J). *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001. ns, no statistical significance.'
