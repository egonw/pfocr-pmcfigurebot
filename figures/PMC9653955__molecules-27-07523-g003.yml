caption: Cell viability of HTB75 (a,b) and HTB161 (c,d) cells following treatment
  with F5-SM and F7-SM at different concentrations for IC50 values at 48 h calculation
  from 5P logistic curve fit using GraphPad Prism version 6.1. Concentration 0 was
  the vehicle-treated control (2.50% and 3.50% v/v methanol for HTB75 and HTB161 respectively).
