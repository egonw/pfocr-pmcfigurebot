caption: Knockdown of SMYD2 inhibits the growth of lung cancer tumors. (a) Representative
  pictures of tumors in the control group and the transfection A549 group. (b) Detect
  the tumor volume of SMYD2 transfected A549 cells. (c) Detect the tumor weight of
  SMYD2 transfected A549 cells. (d) qRT-PCR detects the expression of SMYD2 in the
  tumor tissue after SMYD2 transfected A549 cells are tumor-bearing. (e) Immunohistochemical
  detection of SMYD2 expression in tumor tissues after SMYD2 transfected A549 cells
  are tumor-bearing. (f) qRT-PCR detects the expression of RPS7 in the tumor tissue
  after SMYD2 transfected A549 cells are loaded. (g) Immunohistochemical detection
  of the expression of RPS7 in the tumor tissue after SMYD2 transfected A549 cells
  are bearing the tumor. ∗P < 0.05 and∗∗P < 0.01.
