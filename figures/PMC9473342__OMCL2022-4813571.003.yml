caption: 'DSC2 inhibited the nuclear translocation of BRD4 through forming DSC2/BRD4
  complex. (a) After stably overexpressing DSC2 gene of MGC-803 cells, the DSC2/BRD4
  complex was detected by Co-IP assay. (b) The expression of BRD4 in the nucleus of
  MGC-803 cells with different DSC2 expression were detected by Western blot assay.
  (c) The level of BRD4 accumulated in the nucleus was detected by immunofluorescence
  assay, blue is the nucleus, and red is BRD4. The scale bar = 50 μm. (d) The total
  expressions of DSC2, BRD4, and Snail in MGC-803 cells with different DSC2 expression
  was determined by Western blot assay. Data are presented as mean ± SD from three
  separate experiments. ∗∗∗p < 0.001 vs. NC. ###p < 0.001 vs. Lenti-NC.'
