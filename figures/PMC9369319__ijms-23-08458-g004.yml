caption: Schematic representation of Kv10.1 regulation in cancer. Kv10.1 is an ion
  channel permeable to K+ (green spheres) mainly localized in the plasma membrane,
  but also is found in subcellular structures. The crystal structure of the Kv10.1
  channel is embedded in the plasma membrane, with the transmembrane region in red
  and the intracellular N- and C-termini represented in purple and green, respectively.
  The figure in the upper left corner represents a Kv10.1 subunit; transmembrane segments
  (S1–S6) are represented in red, the N-termini PAS domain in blue, the C-linker in
  green, the cNBDH in orange, and the 3 CaMBD in olive. A functional channel is assembled
  as a tetramer. Kv10.1 has been described as an oncogenic channel, exerting its effects
  through different hypothesized mechanisms. The canonical function of Kv10.1 consists
  of efflux K+ and hyperpolarized membrane potential. The membrane hyperpolarization
  increases the driving force for Ca2+, promoting the signal pathways involved in
  cell division. Kv10.1 expression is under the control of p53 and pRb; when p53 and
  pRb are down-regulated in cancer, an increase of E2F1 occurs, which triggers Kv10.1
  expression. During the cell cycle, Kv10.1 is expressed during the G2/M transition.
  Alterations in the p53 and pRb pathways consequently affect the Kv10.1 levels, e.g.,
  the oncoproteins E6 and E7 of the HPV reduce the expression of p53 and pRb, respectively.
  Other factors influencing Kv10.1 expression include hormones, miRNAs, epigenetic
  modifications, and components of the tumor microenvironment (e.g., collagen). Collagen
  1 can activate the DDR1 pathway, increasing the ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which increases
  the Kv10.1 and ORAI1 levels in the plasma membrane. ERK1/2 phosphorylation, Kv10.1,
  and ORAI1 increased cell survival. Kv10.1 expression is also associated with angiogenesis
  through upregulation of the HIF-1α activity, increasing VEGF release. In addition,
  cells over-expressing Kv10.1 channels seem more resistant to cancer drug treatments
  and radiotherapy; however, the molecular mechanisms implicated in these resistant
  phenotypes are not completely understood.
