figure_title: Characterization of microbiomes between decompensated cirrhosis patients
  with and without infection
caption: (A) Presence of infections. (B) Episodes of infection. (C, D) Site of infection
  and associated functional metabolism. (E, F) IL6 levels and associated functional
  metabolism in pg/ml. Data is presented from linear discriminant analysis effect
  size (LEfSe) analysis and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) scores of the 16S RNA
  sequences. The LEfSe method identifies the significantly different (p<0.05, Kruskal-Wallis
  test, LDA score > 2.0) taxa or functional metabolic pathway at multiple taxonomic
  levels. All significant bacterial taxa are illustrated using cladograms, except
  (C), represented as histogram of the LDA scores (log10). For a complete summary
  of the LEfSe and LDA output between groups (clinical and investigation variables)
  see .
