caption: Knockdown of PTEN significantly reversed the influence of miR-424 inhibitor
  on EMT process in vivo. (A) The EMT and apoptosis related proteins were measured
  with western blotting; (B) The protein expression was analyzed; (C) The mRNA expression
  of EMT and apoptosis related proteins was measured with RT-PCR. * means p <0.05.
  The experiment was performed 3 times.
