caption: Analysis of differences in immune-related pathway. (A) The difference in
  the number of people with all the mutation genes related to RAS-activated, TGFB-activated,
  TP53-activated and Wnt-repressed pathway between TMB-L and TMB-H groups. (B) The
  difference in the number of people with 27 common genes related to Wnt-repressed
  pathway between TMB-L and TMB-H groups and MSI and MSS groups.
