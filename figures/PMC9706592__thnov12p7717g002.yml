caption: 'Rs suppresses immune regulatory activities in the airway tissues. AMCs were
  prepared from NC mice and AAD mice after the treatment denoted on the X axis. A-B,
  CD11c+ DCs were purified from AMCs. RNA extracts of AMCs were analyzed by RT-qPCR.
  Boxplots show the mRNA levels of Cmip and Il10 in DCs. C-F, AMCs were analyzed by
  FCM. Boxplots show the frequency of DC, Tr1 cells, mast cells and eosinophils in
  AMCs (the FCM plots are presented in -5 in ). The data of boxplots are median (IQR)
  of 6 samples per group. Statistics: ANOVA + Bonferroni test. p value is presented
  in boxplots. Abbreviations: AMC: Airway mononuclear cells. NC: Na√Øve control. AAD:
  Airway allergy disorder. FCM: Flow cytometry. Tr1 cell: Type 1 regulatory T cell.
  MC: Mast cell. Eo: Eosinophil. IQR: InterQuartile range.'
