caption: MiR-378a-3p inhibits GC progression and promotes apoptosis of GC cells. (A)
  CCK-8 assays indicating the viability of BGC-823 cells transfected with miR-378a-3p
  mimics or NC. (B, C) Colony formation assays of BGC-823 cells transfected with miR-378a-3p
  mimics or NC. The number of BGC-823 cell colonies and statistical analysis are shown.
  (D) Viability of SGC-7901 cells, detected with CCK-8 assays after transfection with
  miR-378a-3p inhibitor or NC. (E, F) Colony formation assays of SGC-7901 cells transfected
  with miR-378a-3p inhibitor or NC. The number of SGC-7901 cell colonies and statistical
  analysis are shown. (G) Flow cytometry detection of the apoptosis rate of BGC-823
  cells transfected with miR-378a-3p mimics or NC. (H) Flow cytometry detection of
  the apoptosis rate of SGC-7901 cells after transfection with miR-378a-3p inhibitor
  or NC. (I, J) Wound healing assay detection of the migration of BGC-823 cells transfected
  with mimics or NC. The relative migration distance was calculated. (K, L) Transwell
  assay detection of the migration and invasion of BGC-823 cells transfected with
  mimics or NC. The migrated and invaded cells were counted. (M, N) Wound healing
  assay detection of the migration of SGC-7901 cells treated with inhibitor or NC.
  The relative migration distance was calculated. (O, P) Transwell assay detection
  of the migration and invasion of SGC-7901 cells treated with inhibitor or NC. The
  migrated and invaded cells were counted. (Q, R) Correlations among BCL-2 and RAB31,
  MMP2, and RAB31, analyzed on the basis of TCGA database. (S, T) Expression of proteins
  associated with proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and EMT after miR-378a-3p intervention
  in BGC-823 and SGC-7901 cells (**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).
