caption: MiR-217 upregulation prevented IDD development. A Injections of agomiR-217,
  antagomiR-217, or their negative controls were performed 3, 7, 14, and 21 days after
  surgery. B Time-dependent fluorescence images of mice treated for 24 and 72 h with
  agomiR-217, antagomiR-217, or their negative controls labelled by Cy3. Blue to red
  indicates low to high intensity of the fluorescence signal. C X-ray examination
  of intervertebral disc degeneration. The DHI was tested after 12 weeks of treatment
  with different agents. D Histological findings 12 weeks after IDD surgery. In the
  negative control group, there was a decrease in the number of NP cells, which were
  replaced by cells with a more fibroblast-like phenotype. However, there was an increase
  in the number of NP cells in the group treated with agomiR-217 compared to the group
  treated with antagomiR-217 or negative controls. Moreover, the histology scores
  were evaluated. E, F MMP13 and Col II immunostaining in IDD models with different
  treatments. Scale bar = 20 μm. G FCM was used to evaluate apoptotic activity in
  the intervertebral disc; scale bar = 200 μm. IDD, intervertebral disc degeneration;
  NC, negative control; miR, microRNA; Col II, type II collagen; MMP, matrix metalloprotein;
  FCM, flow cytometry. ***P < 0.001
