caption: 'The cGAS-STING-TBK1 signaling pathway. Various DNA derived from virus, dying
  tumor cells or nucleus and mitochondria binds to and activates the cytosolic DNA
  sensor cGAS. cGAS utilizes GTP and ATP to produce the second messenger cGAMP, which
  directly binds to the ER-localized adaptor protein STING. Stimuli other than cGAMP,
  CDNs derived from bacteria can also activate STING. Subsequently, STING alters into
  a more closed conformation and transfers to the Golgi via the ERGIC, where it binds
  and activates the kinase TBK1 and IKK, which phosphorylate IRF3 and IκBα, respectively.
  Then, Phosphorylated IRF3 and IκBα dimerize and enter the nucleus, initiating the
  transcription of Type I IFN, TNF and IL6. These cytokines play a pivotal role in
  host defense, inflammation and antitumor immunity. Abbreviations: cGAS, cyclic GMP-AMP
  synthase; STING, stimulator of interferon genes; TBK1, TANK-binding kinase 1; cGAMP,
  cyclic GMP-AMP; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CDNs, cyclic dinucleotides; ERGIC, ER-Golgi
  intermediate compartment; IKK, IκB kinase; IRF3, interferon regulatory factor 3;
  TNF, tumour necrosis factor.'
