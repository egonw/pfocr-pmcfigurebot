caption: PKM2-IN-1 in combination with NCT-503 induces cell cycle arrest via the AMPK-mediated
  signaling pathway, and inhibits GLUT1 expression. (A) Cell cycle distributions were
  measured by flow cytometry after treatment with PKM2-IN-1, NCT-503, and a combination
  of the two agents. (B) Statistical analysis of the cell cycle distribution. (C)
  The levels of G2/M phase arrest-related proteins were measured by Western blotting
  after treatment with PKM2-IN-1, NCT-503, and combination of the two agents. (D)
  Intracellular ATP level of A549 cells was examined after 24Â h treatment with combination
  of PKM2-IN-1 and NCT-503. (E) The levels of p-AMPK, p-mTOR, p-p70S6K, p-53, and
  GLUT1 were determined by Western blotting. *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01.
