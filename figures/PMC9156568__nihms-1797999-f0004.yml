caption: Representation power comparison between global harmonic wave and our region-adaptive
  harmonic wavelets in simulated data (left) and A-T biomarker data (right). (a) The
  simulated network and one graph signal (displayed in arrows). (b-d) The reconstruction
  loss on simulated data using global harmonic waves , global harmonic waves , and
  our harmonic wavelets . (e) The reconstruction loss on amyloid-PET and tau-PET data
  on the brain network with 148 nodes by global harmonic waves  in blue, global harmonic
  waves  in red, and our harmonic wavelets  in green, where ‘*’ denotes statistical
  significance (p < 0.01).
