caption: Only NMS-873 promotes glycolysis and inhibits oxidative phosphorylation.
  (A,B) Using TMT-based quantitative proteomics to distinguish the unique pathway
  of NMS-873 []. Venn diagram of DE proteins identified from HCT116 cells at 6 h-treatment
  with MG132, CB-5083, and NMS-873. DE proteins were defined as treatment vs. DMSO
  control, p < 0.05; n = 2 (A). The representative KEGG pathway or GO biological process
  from a functional enrichment analysis of the 219 DE proteins identified only in
  the NMS-873 treatment group (B). (C,D) Lactate (C) and glucose (D) concentration
  in the cultured medium were measured after 6 h incubation with DMSO, 4 μM NMS-873,
  4 μM CB-5083, 4 μM UPCDC-30245, or 1 μM MG132. Statistical analyses were carried
  out by non-paired one-way ANOVA (treatment vs. DMSO) using Prism 8. p-values are
  shown as **** p < 0.0001. All of the data from (C,D) are presented as mean ± SD
  from triplicate experiments.
