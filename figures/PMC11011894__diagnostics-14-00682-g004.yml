caption: (Upper) Visualization of the distinct metabolic fingerprint with OPLS-DA
  combined multifactorial analysis of urine metabolites of patients with ALL (blue
  dots) at diagnosis and before the start of the induction compared to controls (red
  dots). (Lower) Boxplots showing the urine compounds with significant differences
  (t-test, sp < 0.05) between ALL patients at diagnosis and compared to controls.
  The asterisk * indicates compounds involved in or related to glutamine metabolic
  pathways (e.g., glutaminolysis), suggesting an important role of this pathway in
  the altered metabolism of cancer cells. Lys = lysine, Ala = alanine, Asn = asparagine,
  Cys = cysteine, Tau = taurine.
