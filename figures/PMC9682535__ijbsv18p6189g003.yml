caption: OI reduces oxidative stress injury in RAW264.7 macrophages by activating
  the Nrf2 signaling pathway. (A-C) ROS release from RAW264.7 macrophages, as detected
  using immunofluorescence and flow cytometry; magnification, 400×. (D) GSH synthesis
  in RAW264.7 macrophages. (E) GSH/GSSG ratio in RAW264.7 macrophages. (F and J) Nrf2,
  GSS, HO-1, and NQO-1 protein synthesis, as detected using western blotting. (G)
  Nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in the LPS+OI treatment group, as indicated using
  immunofluorescence; magnification, 800×. (H) Nrf2 protein synthesis after siNrf2#1
  and siNrf2#2 knockdown, as detected using western blotting. (I) Nrf2, GSS, HO-1,
  and NQO-1 protein synthesis after siNrf2#1 and siNrf2#2 knockdown and LPS/OI treatment,
  as detected using western blotting. All data are pooled from three independent experiments.
  Data represent the mean ± SD. ****P < 0.001, ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05.
