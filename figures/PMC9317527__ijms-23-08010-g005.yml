caption: 'Effects of addition of alanyl-glutamine (AlaGln) to double-chamber PD fluids
  on endothelial cells. (A) Total protein-corrected lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release
  into the cell supernatant (n = 3 individual experiments from three different donors,
  each comprising in total 18 samples, means ± SEM). ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001 (ANOVA,
  post hoc: Tukey’s). (B) Volcano plots for regulated proteins in HUVEC exposed to
  double-chamber PD fluid with added 8 mM AlaGln vs. double-chamber PD fluid without
  the additive. Colored points are LIMMA p < 0.05 and log2[fold change] > 0.3. Dark
  green: adjusted p < 0.05 after Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction for multiple testing.
  (C) Panther pathways analysis for the proteins regulated by AlaGln in double-chamber
  PD fluid. Each bubble represents a pathway, the intensity of the blue color is proportional
  to the p-value. Significantly enriched pathways are labeled with their respective
  names (Fisher’s exact p < 0.05, fold enrichment > 2). (D) Heatmap of significantly
  (Fisher’s exact p < 0.05) regulated IPA canonical pathways following double-chamber
  fluid exposure compared with double-chamber PD fluid supplemented with 8 mM AlaGln.
  Only oxidative stress related pathways are shown. The p-value is visualized in violet
  by fill color intensity. Activation z-scores are indicated as up (activated; red)
  or down (deactivated; blue) colored arrows. The direction of the arrow reflects
  the direction of the regulation (predicted activation: up, predicted inhibition:
  down). The NRF2-mediated Oxidative Stress Response pathway was extracted from IPA,
  manually curated and modified, and overlaid with differentially regulated proteins
  following exposure to double-chamber PD fluid with AlaGln vs. double-chamber PD
  fluid alone. Down-regulated proteins (green) and up-regulated proteins (red) * p
  = 0.042 (LIMMA).'
