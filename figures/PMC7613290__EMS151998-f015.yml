figure_title: The cell integrity/Pmk1 but not the TORC2/Gad8 stress signalling pathway
  regulates Epe1 processing and resistance
caption: a. Diagram of part the S. pombe TORC2/Tor1-dependent signalling pathway.b.
  Western detecting Epe1-GFP or α-tubulin from wild-type, or gad8Δ cells untreated
  (-)/ treated (+) with 14mM/16h caffeine.c. Western detecting Epe1-Myc or α-tubulin
  from wild-type, pek1Δ, pmk1Δ, atf1Δ or pmp1Δ cells untreated (-)/treated (+) with
  0.5mM/16h fluconazole (FLC).d. Number of resistant colonies formed/1x104 viable
  cells plated by wild-type, epe1Δ, sty1Δ, atf1Δ and gad8Δ on plates containing 16mM
  caffeine (CAF).e. Number of resistant colonies formed/1x104 viable cells plated
  by wild-type, epe1Δ, sty1Δ, atf1Δ and gad8Δ on plates containing 0.5mM fluconazole
  (FLC).Plots d and e; Error bars are from independent measurements from 3 biological
  replicates. Data are presented mean values +/- SD, with dots representing independent
  plate counts. The significance of the difference between samples was evaluated using
  a two-tailed Student’s t-test. (*) P <0.033, (**) P <0.002; (***) P <0.0002; (****)
  P <0.0001; (n.s). not significant.
