caption: 'Enrichment analysis of differential metabolites. Each bubble in the bubble
  chart represents a metabolic pathway. The abscissa and size of the bubble indicate
  the influence of the factor on the pathway in the topology analysis. The p value
  of the enrichment analysis is presented as a bubble color in the bubble ordinate.
  A darker color results in a smaller p value and a more significant degree of enrichment.
  (A–C) are bubble plots of M1 vs. S1, M20 vs. S20, and M40 vs. S40. Abbreviations:
  M, mixed-fermentation cheese; S, single-strain-fermentation cheese. Numbers 1–40
  represent different ripening times (in days).'
