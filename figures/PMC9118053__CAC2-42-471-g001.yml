caption: 'Tumor microenvironment evolution in colorectal liver metastases during treatment.
  (A) Heatmap‐depicted metabolism activity and immune signatures. The related signatures
  were obtained from Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
  (KEGG) pathway from the MSigDB database of Broad Institute. Then, the gene set was
  scored by the ssGSEA method and statistically analyzed. (B) Changes in T cell activation
  and cell cycle‐related signature scores, and GPAGs of non‐responders and responders
  from pre‐treatment to post‐treatment. (C) Representative IHC images and density
  quantification of CD8+ T cells in the tumor before and after treatment. Total magnification,
  × 400/ × 800. (D) Changes in the TCR diversity score in patients. (E) Changes of
  TCR diversity with various treatment outcomes. (F) Neutrophil differences from responders
  and non‐responders after treatment. (G) Representative IHC images and density quantification
  showing neutrophil infiltration during treatment. Total magnification, × 400/ ×
  950/ × 1 800. (H) Representative vascular morphology images (triangle and arrows).
  Vessel density and α‐SMA+ vessels change during treatment. (I) Schematic of the
  TME dynamics during treatment. Bars show the Mean ± SD. P value is based on a two‐tailed
  paired Student''s t‐test (B, C, G and H), and a two‐tailed Student''s t‐test (H).
