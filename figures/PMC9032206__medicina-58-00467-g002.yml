caption: 'Consequences of EMT in carcinomas: the graphic presents how the tumor-initiating
  ability, invasiveness and degree of chemoresistance change during EMT activation.
  The tumor-initiating ability is affected by the degree of EMT activation; immense
  EMT activation has a deleterious effect on the tumor-initiating ability []. Drug
  resistance is also related to EMT and reaches its maximum at an intermediate level
  of EMT activation [,]. The migration of cancer cells requires the strong activation
  of the EMT program []. EMT—epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.'
