figure_title: Peripheral Blood B Lymphocytes Demonstrate an Interferon Gene Signature
  In Lupus
caption: A) Flow sorting strategy. Human peripheral blood from healthy donors (n=5)
  or SLE (n=8) patients meeting ACR criteria were stained for CD3, CD11c, CD19, CD14,
  CD27 and IgD then flow sorted into CD14+ (monocytes), CD27- IgD- CD19+ (DN B cells),
  or CD27-IgD+ CD19+ (naïve/transitional B cells) populations and their RNA isolated
  for bulk RNA-Seq transcriptomic analysis. B) Hierarchical clustering of all significantly
  differentially expressed genes in each cell type (monocytes, DN B cells, and naïve
  B cells). Sex, size factor, and disease status shown in bars above heat map. For
  each cell type, healthy donor cells (olive green) clustered together. Scale for
  normalized expression for all plots shown in red/blue on the left. C) Volcano plots
  for each cell type demonstrating healthy versus SLE differential gene expression.
  Select (prototypical ISG) differentially expressed genes are labeled. D) Venn diagram
  demonstrating number of upregulated genes (top) in SLE for monocytes (green), double
  negative B cells (salmon) and naïve B cells (blue) compared to HD. Venn diagram
  demonstrating numbers of downregulated genes (bottom) in SLE differential expression
  gene analysis for naïve B cells (blue), double negative B cells (salmon) and monocytes
  (green). E) Gene set enrichment analysis for differentially expressed genes upregulated
  in SLE common between monocytes, naïve and DN B cells. Size of dot corresponds to
  the percentage of genes in the pathway identified as upregulated. Color of dot corresponds
  to adjusted P-value.
