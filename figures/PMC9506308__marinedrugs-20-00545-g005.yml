caption: 'Gene analysis of the antioxidant signaling pathway of G. lemaneiformis polysaccharide
  and its degradation products on HepG2 cells. Note: (a) mRNA expression of the Nrf-2
  gene, (b) mRNA expression of the Keap-1 gene, (c) mRNA expression of the HO-1 gene,
  (d) mRNA expression of the NQO-1 gene, (e) mRNA expression of the ZO-1 gene. “*”
  represents significant differences between the other groups and the model group,
  “#” represents significant differences between the other groups and the NC group,
  and p < 0.05 indicates significant differences.'
