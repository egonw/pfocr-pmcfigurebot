caption: UV-B-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway. (A) Heatmap representation
  of hierarchical clustering analysis of UV-B-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway
  genes and transcription factor genes. Blue, low expression; red, high expression,
  based on log10(FPKM). (B) Proposed model of UV-B-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis
  pathways. Solid line indicates known signaling pathway; dotted line indicates putative
  signaling pathway. Arrows indicate activation; short lines indicate inhibition.
