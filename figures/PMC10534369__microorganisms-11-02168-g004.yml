caption: Top 22 differential gene pathway enrichment results. The X-axis represents
  the enrichment factor value, and the Y-axis represents the pathway name. Color represents
  the p-value, with smaller values representing more significant enrichment results.
  The size of the dots represents the number of DEGs. Rich Factor refers to the enrichment
  factor value, and a larger value indicates a more pronounced enrichment result.
  Rich Factor was calculated as the number of differentially expressed genes under
  the pathway term divided by the total number of annotated genes under that pathway
  term.
