caption: 'Effects of TIIA on body weight and food intake in methionine choline deficiency
  diet-induced rats. (A) Weight of NASH-F rats was significantly decreased compared
  with that of control rats between 2 and 8 weeks. ##P<0.01 vs. control group (n=8).
  The weight of TIIA rats was increased between 2 and 8 weeks compared with that of
  NASH-F rats. *P<0.05 vs. NASH-F group (n=8). (B) Control rats maintained a stable
  food intake during the modeling period. The food intake of the NASH-F group was
  decreasedcompared with the control group. ##P<0.01 vs. control group (n=8). The
  food intake of the TIIA group decreased compared with the NASH-F group, but there
  was no statistical significance (P=0.078; n=8). NASH-F, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-related
  fibrosis; TIIA, tanshinone IIA.'
