caption: SIRT7 regulates YAP nuclear localization and activation. (A) Volcano plot
  of differentially regulated genes in Hep3B cells transduced with scramble shRNA
  (shControl) or SIRT7 shRNA (shSIRT7). Green indicates a decrease, and red indicates
  an increase. (B) Differential gene‐enriched signaling pathways were identified using
  KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. (C, D) qRT‐PCR and western blot analysis of MST1
  and YAP in SIRT7 knockdown cells. The numbers below the lane indicate relative band
  intensity normalized to GAPDH. (E) Immunofluorescence staining of YAP (green) in
  Hep3B cells with or without SIRT7 knockdown. (F) 8xGTIIC‐luciferase plasmids were
  transfected in SIRT7‐knockdown Hep3B or SIRT7−/− MEF cells; luciferase assay was
  performed 24 h after transfection. (G) qRT‐PCR analysis of ctgf and CYR61 mRNA expression
  in Huh7 cells with SIRT7 knockdown. (H) Western blot analysis of YAP and MST1 expression
  in HepG2 and Huh7 cells with SIRT7 overexpression. The numbers below the lane indicate
  relative band intensity normalized to GAPDH. (I) Immunofluorescence staining of
  YAP (green) in Hep3B cells transfected with Flag‐SIRT7 or Flag‐SIRT7 HY (red). (J)
  qRT‐PCR analysis of ctgf and CYR61 mRNA expression in Huh7 cells with SIRT7 overexpression.
  Graphs are presented as means ± SD of at least three replicates. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.
