caption: 'TRAF molecular pathway visualization using OncoboxPD software. Nodes correspond
  to individual pathway components or to their complexes. Color of every node reflects
  logarithm of mean CNR for all node components, according to a scale given with green
  upregulated, and red downregulated nodes. Grey nodes have no gene components, and
  no CNR values. Nodes that are unaffected (with CNR ∼ 1) are shown white. Red and
  green arrows stand for inhibitory and activating interactions, respectively. Ovals
  denote gene products, octagons - metabolites, hexagons – complexes, and other nodes
  (text labels without recognized molecular components) are shown as rectangles. A
  bold black border indicates outlier values that are outside of scale limits. In
  this example, RNA sequencing gene expression profile of thyroid papillary cancer
  sample TC15  was compared against six healthy thyroid samples from ANTE collection
  . A) Static pathway graph. B) Projection of dynamic interactive pathway graph. The
  figure can be found following the path: result file in Folders(“example” with green
  icon)->sample TC15 in Sample table-> Pathway activation level tab->TRAF Pathway->
  static and dynamic graphs. (For interpretation of the references to color in this
  figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)'
