caption: 'Effects of DHA with different molecular forms on the expression of PPARγ/NF-κB
  signaling pathway in 95D lung cancer cells (A) Western bolt analysis for NF-κB,
  Bcl-2, Bax, and cleaved caspase-3 protein expression. (B) Quantitative RT-PCR analysis
  of the mRNA expression levels of NF-κB. (C) Quantitative analysis of the NF-κB,
  Bcl-2, Bax, and cleaved caspase-3 protein expression levels. Data are presented
  as mean ± SD (n = 6). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 versus control group. Abbreviations:
  nuclear transcription factor-κB (NF-κB), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2 associated
  X protein (Bax), cleaved cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase-3 (Cleaved caspase-3).'
