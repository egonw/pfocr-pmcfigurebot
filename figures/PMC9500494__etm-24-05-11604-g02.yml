caption: Knockdown of IMPA2 inhibits the migration and invasion of the epithelial
  ovarian cancer cells. Migration was examined using a Transwell assay in the (A)
  ES-2 and (B) SKOV3 cells transfected with shCtrl and shIMPA2. Invasion was analyzed
  using a Matrigel assay in the (C) ES-2 and (D) SKOV3 cells transfected with shCtrl
  and shIMPA2. **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs. shCtrl. IMPA2, inositol monophosphatase
  2; sh, short hairpin; Ctrl, control.
article_title: Inositol monophosphatase 2 promotes epithelial ovarian cancer cell
  proliferation and migration by regulating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
