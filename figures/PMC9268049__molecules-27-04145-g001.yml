caption: Nrf2 activation/inhibition in cancer cells. Various molecular mechanisms
  in cancer cells constitute activation of Nrf2, leading to gene expression associated
  with progression of tumors. The resultant effect is in the form of activation of
  metabolic reprogramming, enhanced cell proliferation, drug resistance, and adaptation
  to stress. Nrf2 antioxidant activation also induces an imbalance in the carbon metabolism
  in cancer. Keap-1; kelch-like ECH-associated proteins, Nrf2; nuclear factor erythroid
  2-related factor 2, MAF; musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma protein.
