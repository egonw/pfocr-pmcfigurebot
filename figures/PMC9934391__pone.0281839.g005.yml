figure_title: Pseudo-heatmap representing the level of completeness of KEGG metabolic
  modules in the studied Fructobacillus strains and L. mesenteroides ATCC 8293T
caption: Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of total blocks for each pathway,
  and percentages show the ratio between found blocks in each genome and total blocks
  for each metabolic module. One asterisk (p < 0.05) or two asterisks (p < 0.01) indicate
  modules with significant differences in the number of present blocks between both
  groups of strains (clades 1 and 2).
