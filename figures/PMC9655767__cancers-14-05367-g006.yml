caption: SETD8 regulates apoptosis-related genes, TP73 and KIAA1324 via H4K20 methylation
  in endometrial cancer cells. (A) Survival analysis of SETD8, TP73, and KIAA1324
  in endometrial cancer using the TCGA datasets. (B) HEC50B cells were transfected
  with siSETD8 and treated with 0.02% DMSO as well as UNC0379 (3 μM) for 48 h. mRNA
  expression levels of TP73 and KIAA1324 were significantly upregulated in siSETD8-transfected
  and UNC0379-treated HEC50B cells (p < 0.01). (C,D) HEC50B cells were transfected
  with siSETD8 for 48 h and treated with 0.02% DMSO as well as UNC0379 for 96 h. SiSETD8-transfected
  and UNC0379 (1 μM)-treated cells showed a decrease in H4K20me1 and increase in TP73
  protein expression levels. Following immunocytochemistry, siSETD8-transfected and
  UNC0379 (3 μM)-treated cells showed upregulated expression of TP73. (E) Schematic
  representation of SETD8-mediated regulation of TP73, KIAA1324, and TP53 expression.
