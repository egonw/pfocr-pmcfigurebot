caption: Effects of M1-CM on ErbB2/AKT/ErK signaling pathway activation. (a) The protein
  levels of ErK, p-ErK, AKT, and p-AKT in SCC25 and CAL27 cells stimulated by M1-CM.
  The relative expressions of p-ErK/ErK and p-AKT/AKT were detected (n = 3). (b) Protein
  level of ErbB2 and p-ErbB2 in SCC25 and CAL27 cells (up panel) treated with or without
  M1-CM for 30 min; quantitative analysis of p-ErbB2/ErbB2 protein expression (down
  panel). (c) Protein expression of ErK, p-ErK, AKT, and p-AKT in SCC25 and CAL27
  cells treated with or without M1-CM and Inhibitor + M1-CM (left panel); quantitative
  analysis of p-ErK/ErK and p-AKT/AKT (right panel) expression. The histograms represent
  the mean Â± SD (n = 3). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001.
