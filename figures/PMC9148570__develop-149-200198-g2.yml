caption: Kidney organoid-derived podocyte subcluster 3 partially resembles adult podocytes.
  (A,B) UMAP integration of 401 podocytes (A) identified three subclusters based on
  differentially expressed genes (B). Avg, average; Pct, percent. (C) RNAscope analysis
  showing nephrin (NPHS1), collagen IV alpha three (COL4A3) and endothelial marker
  cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31) expression. Inset shows an enlarged view of
  the boxed area. (D) Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) expression among
  the podocyte subclusters. (E,F) CD31-, VE-cadherin- and plasmalemmal vesicle associated
  protein-1 (PV-1)-stained endothelial capillaries are interspaced between podocytes
  expressing NPHS1 (E) and synaptopodin (SYNPO) (F) in the organoids. Arrowheads indicate
  endothelial capillaries with lumen. (G) Ultrastructural analysis showing the luminal
  space of a capillary adjacent to organoid podocytes. (H) Cell-cell interactions
  between all cells present in kidney organoids using CellPhoneDB and CrossTalkeR
  packages. Thickness and depth of color of the arrows correspond to the percentage
  of interactions. (I) Autocrine and paracrine podocyte ligand-receptor interactions
  showing a dominant role for VEGFA signaling originating from cluster 3 to VEGF-related
  receptors in, amongst others, endothelial cell precursors (EC). Analysis was performed
  using CellPhoneDB and CrossTalkeR packages. (J-L) Comparative PROGENy (J), GO terms
  (K) and DoRothEA analysis (L) showing pathway activity (J), biological processes
  (K) and transcription factor activity (L) between the three podocyte subclusters,
  adult and fetal podocytes [adult and fetal podocytes sequencing data extracted from
  Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE118184 and GSE112570)]. Abbreviations as in .
