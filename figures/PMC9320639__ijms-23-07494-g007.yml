caption: Details of hormone−related genes detected in the female zebrafish brains
  by RNA−seq. (A) Clustering analysis of hormone−related genes. (B) Bar plot of pathway
  enrichment analysis of genes in cluster 1 and cluster 2. False discovery rate (FDR)
  < 0.05. (C) Protein−protein interaction network of genes in cluster 1 and cluster
  2. Nodes represent genes; edges stand for relationship of different genes; different
  color means different signaling pathways as shown at the bottom. (D) Venn diagram
  was used to identify down-regulated key genes that were shared in the group of down-regulated
  genes (a’, b’ and c’) and cluster 1 and 2. (E) Heat map of seven down-regulated
  key genes, presented as the normalization of TPM (z−score). (F,G) Fold changes and
  SEM of RNA−seq and qPCR for two representative down-regulated key genes gh1 and
  lhb.
