caption: 'Effects of M1 macrophages on the cell cycle of liver cancer cells via activating
  the NF-κB pathway. (A) The cell cycle of HepG2 cells was detected by flow cytometry.
  (B and C) The expression levels of CDK1, CDK2, cyclin D1 and P21 in HepG2 cells
  were detected by western blot analysis. (B) Representative western blot image and
  (C) quantified results. (D) The cell cycle of SNU-182 cells was detected by flow
  cytometry. (E and F) The expression levels of CDK1, CDK2, cyclin D1 and P21 in SNU-182
  cells were detected by western blot analysis. (E) Representative western blot image
  and (F) quantified results. All experiments were performed in triplicate. **P<0.01,
  ***P<0.001 vs. RM group; #P<0.05, ##P<0.01, ###P<0.001 vs. CM group. RM, regular
  medium; CM, conditioned medium; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase.'
