caption: HyYap acts upstream of canonical Wnt signaling during budding. (A). Whole
  mount in situ hybridization of Hydra with anti-HyWnt3 probe. Arrows point to areas
  of HyWn3t expression. (B) Graph shows the increased number of HyWnt3 spots in the
  body column of polyps electroporated with shHyYap; two-tailed unpaired t test. (C
  and D) Anti-GFP immunostaining of HyBra2-GFP polyps electroporated with shHyYap,
  6 d after electroporation. (C) Apical view. (D) Lateral view of GFP+ bud. (E) Graph
  shows the increased number of GFP+ spot in the body column of HyBra2-GFP polyps
  electroporated with shHyYap; two-tailed unpaired t test. (F) Graph shows decreased
  budding rate in polyps electroporated with shHyWnt compared to Hydras electroporated
  with shGFP. N, number of animals; n, number of experiments; one-tailed paired t
  test. (G) Graph shows the decreased budding rate in polyps electroporated with shHyYap/shHyWnt
  compared with Hydras electroporated with shHyYap alone; two-tailed unpaired t test.
