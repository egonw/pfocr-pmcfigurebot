caption: 'CYTOR mediated ENO2 binding to LATS1 and inhibited the degradation of YAP1.
  (A): Co-IP assay of anti-LATS1 in RKO cells. (B): RIP assay of CYTOR with anti-ENO2,
  anti-LATS1 and anti-YAP1 in RKO cells. (C): Co-IP assay of anti-LATS1 in RKO mock/RKO
  CYTOR KO cells. (D,E): Co-IP assay of anti-ENO2 (left) and anti-LATS1 (right) in
  SW480 cells. (F): KO of ENO2 significantly enhanced the binding between LATS1 and
  YAP1. (G): Immunohistochemical staining revealed the differences in ENO2 and YAP1
  expression in implanted orthotopic splenic tumors from the two groups (magnification,
  200×). (H): Schematic representation of the ENO2 signal transduction pathway in
  CRC. Data are shown as the mean ± SD. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.'
