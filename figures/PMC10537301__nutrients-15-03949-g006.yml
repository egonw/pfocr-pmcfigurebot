caption: KEGG pathway and GO enrichment analyses of identified hub-target proteins
  (p-value â‰¤ 0.05). (A) The biological processes (top 10), (B) the cellular components
  (top 10), (C) the molecular functions (top 10), (D) the KEGG pathways (top 20).
  The p-values for each term are shown by the colours, with darker colours indicating
  lower p-values. The number of genes associated with each term are indicated by the
  dot sizes, with larger dots representing more genes.
