caption: Expression of HDV antigens in non-infectious models. (a) Huh7 cells were
  transfected with plasmids encoding S-HDAg (pDL444), L-HDAg (pDL445), or pVax1 empty
  vector, and the expression of HDV antigens was analyzed by Western blotting 48 h
  post-transfection. (b) Huh7 cells were transfected with the pSVLD3 plasmid harboring
  the trimeric HDV genome, and the expression of HDV antigens was assessed by Western
  blotting 4 and 6 days post-transfection.
