caption: Jablonski diagram of photosensitizer excitation and production of singlet
  oxygen, and major nodes of improvement in photodynamic therapy. When the light excites
  the electron of a ground state photosensitizer, it gets promoted to an excited singlet
  state. The excited photosensitizer (PS) returns back to the ground state via two
  processes. It can directly lose energy through fluorescence (hvf) or get converted
  into a triplet state through the intersystem crossing. The triplet-state PS settles
  down to the ground state by transferring energy to oxygen molecules or transferring
  electrons or protons to substrates or via phosphorescence (hvp). Additionally, by
  absorbing more energy, singlet oxygen (1Δg) (first excited state) can convert to
  singlet oxygen (1Σg+) (second excited state). (a) Localized light focusing can be
  achieved using two-photo light, which is often in a longer wavelength range. It
  is not absorbed by the surrounding medium; only a photosensitizer that can sequentially
  absorb two photons of light will be excited. (b) Sensitizer location is very important
  in terms of effectiveness and the pathway it takes to cause cell death. For example,
  sensitizer activity in the mitochondria causes cell death through the intrinsic
  pathway, while sensitizer activity in the plasma membrane causes cell death due
  to cell rupture and extrinsic pathway. (c) Quenching agent (Q) can be fused with
  the sensitizer(s) to control the location of its excitation. Q can only be detached
  from the sensitizer under a certain cellular environment, which reduces the likelihood
  of sensitizer excitation in an unwanted location. (d) During the process of photodynamic
  therapy, singlet oxygen is not only produced in cancer cells but also produced in
  normal cells. The utilization of singlet oxygen scavengers in the surrounding cells
  can reduce the oxidative stress on normal cells.
