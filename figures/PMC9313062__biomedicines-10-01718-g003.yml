caption: Pathway analysis showing significantly altered pathways in the CTE group.
  X-axis represents the pathway impact value from pathway topology analysis. Y-axis
  represents the âˆ’log10 (p) value from the enrichment analysis. The impact value is
  indicated by the size of the node and the significance of the pathway is indicated
  by the color of the node from yellow to red.
