caption: Schematic comparison of the physiological and pathophysiological cellular
  mechanisms induced by glutamate release at the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) synapse.
  In response to light stimulation, glutamate is readily released from the presynaptic
  ribbon of bipolar cells onto their postsynaptic partners. Under physiological conditions,
  the initial AMPA receptor-mediated membrane depolarization increases the opening
  probability of the NMDA receptors, inducing a temporary intracellular calcium influx.
  Calcium can be also released through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3R)
  and the ryanodine receptors (RyR) expressed on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.
  Functional mitochondrial metabolism efficiently contributes to intracellular calcium
  homeostasis, for instance, through the supply of ATP allowing calcium reuptake by
  Sarco-Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase (SERCA) and extrusion of calcium to the
  extracellular space through the sodium-calcium ATPase. In addition, calcium is extruded
  by the sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) using the physiological sodium gradient, and
  calcium-binding proteins buffer calcium, limiting its spatio-temporal availability.
  mGluR1 is associated with the scaffolding protein Homer-1a, which can, together
  with NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic calcium influx, contribute to pro-survival
  signalling pathways including PIK3/Akt/mTOR and CAMKII/CREB. Phosphorylated CREB
  translocates to the nucleus where it functions as a transcription factor of the
  immediate early genes (IEGs). Glutamate reuptake by EAAT1 expressed on Müller glia
  and by EAAT2 expressed on bipolar cells, allows for rapid glutamate clearance at
  the synaptic cleft. Physiological glutamate metabolism in Müller glia allows recycling
  of the neurotransmitter by glutamine synthase which transforms glutamate to glutamine
  using ATP. Prolonged exposure to glutamate under pathophysiological conditions,
  induces intracellular calcium overload by overstimulating glutamate receptors including
  calcium-permeable (CP)-AMPA receptors and destabilising the membrane potential resulting
  in reverse activity of NCX. Prolonged NMDA receptor-mediated calcium influx, and
  mGluR1 interaction with the isoform Homer-1c, cause calcium-induced calcium release
  (CICR) from endoplasmic reticulum calcium stores, exacerbating calcium dyshomeostasis
  and triggering mitochondrial dysfunction and energy failure. Hence, reduced ATP
  availability limits the capability of SERCA and the sodium-calcium ATPase to extrude
  intracellular calcium. In addition, NMDA receptor overstimulation leads to mitochondrial
  fragmentation and to the production of nitric oxide (NO) which in turn both enhance
  NMDA receptor activity. Calcium overload and the unfolded protein response (UPR)
  promote the pro-apoptotic signalling pathway of p38/JNK and inhibit pro-survival
  ones, and the phosphorylation and activation of the c-Jun/Fos transcription factor
  results in transcription of pro-apoptotic genes such as C/EBP Homologous Protein
  (CHOP). Under pathophysiological conditions, glutamate clearance is impaired because
  of downregulation of Müller glial glutamate transporters and their metabolic failure,
  resulting in ROS production and reduction of mitochondrial ATP production. This
  results in glutamate spill-over from the synaptic to the extrasynaptic space, activating
  extrasynaptic NMDA receptors and promoting neuronal degeneration through a myriad
  of downstream mechanisms []. These include calpain activation and activation of
  the caspase-mediated apoptotic pathway as a result of cytochrome c (Cytc) release
  from mitochondria.
