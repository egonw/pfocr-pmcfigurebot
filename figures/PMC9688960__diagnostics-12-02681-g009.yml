caption: GO and KEGG enrichment analyses for the Timeless gene and the 25 most frequently
  altered neighbor genes in lung cancer performed using the DAVID database. (D) GO
  analysis suggested that the Timeless gene and its altered neighbor genes were mainly
  enriched in BP terms including DNA replication, regulation of signal transduction
  by p53 class mediator and DNA damage checkpoint. (B) GO analysis in the category
  CC indicated that these genes were mainly enriched in DNA replication factor C complex
  and Ctf18 RFC-like complex in the nucleoplasm. (A) GO analysis in the category MF
  suggested that the genes were mainly enriched in DNA clamp loader activity, single-stranded
  DNA-dependent ATPase activity and DNA binding. (C) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
  of the genes indicated that mismatch repair, circadian rhythm and DNA replication
  may be involved in the oncogenesis and mechanism of lung cancer. GO, Gene Ontology;
  MF, molecular function; CC, cellular component; BP, biological process; KEGG, Kyoto
