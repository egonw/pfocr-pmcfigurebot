figure_title: RHBDL2 promotes proliferation and mobility of PC cells in vitro and
  in vivo
caption: 'CCK-8 (A), colony formation (B), and EdU (scale bar: 50 μm) (C) assays were
  used to evaluate the proliferation capacity of the RHBDL2-overexpressing, RHBDL2
  downregulated, and corresponding negative control cells. The mobility of the indicated
  PC cells was verified by wound healing (scale bar: 100 μm) (D) and Transwell assays
  (scale bar: 50 μm) (E). Subcutaneous xenograft tumors (F), tumor weight (G), and
  tumor volume (H) in nude mice (n = 25). I IHC staining of RHBDL2 and the levels
  of Ki-67 and PCNA in the indicated tumors resected from the nude mice. Scale bar:
  50 μm. Representative images of the tail vein-injected mouse models (scale bar:
  100 μm) (J), and the lung foci number was evaluated (K), (n = 25). *P < 0.05.'
article_title: RHBDL2 promotes the proliferation, migration, and invasion of pancreatic
  cancer by stabilizing the N1ICD via the OTUD7B and activating the Notch signaling
  pathway.
