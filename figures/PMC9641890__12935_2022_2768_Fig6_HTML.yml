caption: 'CHRNB2 negatively regulated β-catenin pathway. A–D GSEA results showed that
  CHRNB2 negatively related to the Wnt/β-catenin signaling and downstream MYC and
  Cyclin D1 pathways, but positively related to the deactivation pathway of β-catenin
  (NES: Normalized Enrichment Score). E, F Downregulating CHRNB2 could increase the
  expression of the β-catenin and its downstream proteins including C-Myc, Cyclin
  D1, and CD44 in both RNA and protein levels. G Overexpressing CHRNB2 could decrease
  the expression of the β-catenin and its downstream proteins including C-Myc, Cyclin
  D1, and CD44. H–G The correlation between CHRNB2 and the expression of SOX6, SRY,
  SOX17 and TCF7L2 in TCGA database. L Overexpressing CHRNB2 could enhance the expression
  of SOX6, SRY, SOX17, but repress the expression of TCF7L2 in T3M4. (*: P < 0.05;
  **: P < 0.01; ***: P < 0.001)'
