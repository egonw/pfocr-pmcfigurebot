caption: Cell viability of HTB75 cells following treatment with THC or with combinations
  of THC, CBG, CBC and CBN as in F7 or F5, at total concentrations of (a) 13 and (b)
  15 µg/mL (treatments are listed in ). Cell viability was determined by XTT assay
  as a function of live cell number at 48 h. All calculations were in relation to
  the control (the vehicle treated control of 1.30% and 1.50% v/v methanol for a and
  b, respectively) that was considered to have 100% cell viability (not shown). Error
  bars indicate ± SE (n = 3). Levels with different Upper case letters were significantly
  different from all combinations of pairs by Tukey–Kramer honest significant difference
  (HSD; p ≤ 0.05).
