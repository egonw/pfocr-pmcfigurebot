caption: The inhibitory effect of cucurbitacin B was attenuated by glutathione, N-acetyl-L-cysteine,
  and, to a lesser extent, L-cysteine. (A–C) A549 cells were pretreated with serial
  dilutions of glutathione (A), N-acetyl-L-cysteine (B), and L-cysteine (C) for 1
  h and were then treated with (+) or without (−) cucurbitacin B (10 µM) for 1 h and
  with (+) or without (−) TNF-α (2.5 ng/mL) for 6 h in the presence or absence of
  compounds at the indicated final concentrations. Cell-surface ICAM-1 (%) is shown
  as the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001.
