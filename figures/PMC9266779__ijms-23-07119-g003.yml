caption: 'Shear stress enhanced IDO expression and IDO-catabolised kynurenine product
  in hPDLSCs via ERK1/2 signalling pathway. After shear stress stimulation (at 5 dyn/cm),
  hPDLSCs treated with CHX were examined for IDO mRNA expression and kynurenine product
  (A,B). The activity of ERK1/2 was examined by Western blot analysis (C). The quantitative
  analysis of Western blot band intensity showed that ERK inhibitor attenuated P-ERK1/2
  (D), but not ERK1/2 expression in shear stress-induced hPDLSCs (E). The addition
  of an ERK inhibitor inhibits the effect of shear stress-induced kynurenine secretion
  (F). However, shear stress did not affect TGF-1 secretion (G). * p < 0.05 vs. non-shear
  stress without ERK inhibitor group. # p < 0.05 vs. control.'
