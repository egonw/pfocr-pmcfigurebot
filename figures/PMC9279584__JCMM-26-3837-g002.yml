caption: Knockdown of PB1 increases the expression levels of key glycolytic enzymes.
  (A) RNAseq data showing enriched KEGG terms in 786‐O cells. (B) GSE analysis showing
  that the glycolysis pathway was slightly enriched (p = 0.1973). (C) QRT–PCR analysis
  from two independent duplicates showing the mRNA levels of the selected gene. (D)
  Representative results of a Western blot showing the protein levels of key glycolytic
  enzymes. (*p < 0.05)
