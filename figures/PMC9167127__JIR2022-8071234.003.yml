caption: IL-22 promoted the cell migration of lung cancer cells. PC-9 and A549 cells
  were treated with IL-22 (0, 5, 10, 50, and 100 ng/mL) for 48 hours. The effect of
  IL-22 on tumor cell migration was evaluated by wound healing assay (scale bar =
  100 μm) (a) and Transwell assay (scale bar = 50 μm) (b). The data are representatives
  of three independent experiments and presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD).
  ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001, compared to the low concentration group.
