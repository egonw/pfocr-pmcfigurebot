caption: 'A simplified diagrammatic representation of WNT signalling pathway: During
  inactive state β-catenin and Cadherin form a conjugate that combine with other factors
  like Casein kinase 1 CK1, Glycogen synthase kinase 3 GSK3, APC, Axin, which are
  degraded with the help of a β-trcp protein. Apparently, in the active phase the
  WNT signalling helps β-catenin to transduce from the membrane while it forms the
  complex at the same time stimulation of Dishevelled protein results in inhibition
  of GSK3 and frees the β-catenin, this unbundled β-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm
  and target genes like MMP7, MMP14, RAS, FSP1 and alters their mechanism leading
  to myofibroblast activation causing excess ECM deposition.'
