caption: 'The counteraction of Sal B or TAK-242 on the iopromide-induced apoptosis.
  (a) TAK-242 was found to protect HK-2 cells against iopromide-induced injury n = 5.
  Data are the mean ± SD. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. control group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 vs.
  iopromide group. (b) Sal B or TAK-242 increased HK-2 cell viability. n = 5. Data
  are the mean ± SD. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. control group; ##P < 0.01 vs. iopromide group.
  (c, d) Sal B or TAK-242 attenuated the iopromide-induced apoptosis. n = 6. Data
  are the mean ± SD. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. control group; ##P < 0.01 vs. iopromide group.'
