caption: Bidirectional psychological and neurological effects of RA and the brain
  on each other. Recurrent pain and prolonged inflammation are prominent symptoms
  of RA and are strongly associated with mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety.
  In contrast, mental health can influence RA disease activity and is associated with
  reduced treatment response in RA patients. For example, patients with depression
  have an increased risk of RA, while antidepressants are reported to have a protective
  and therefore confounding effect on RA. The CNS and PNS both play a role in inflammation.
  The vagus nerve is the main efferent pathway that mediates immunosuppression of
  the CNS. It controls the production of TNF and other proinflammatory cytokines through
  the splenic nerve. Sensory nerves are activated by proinflammatory cytokines, such
  as IL-1 and IL-6, and sensory immune information is then sent to regions of the
  brain and spinal cord to mount an appropriate response. The HPA axis and SNS then
  carry information from the CNS to the PNS. While the parasympathetic nervous system
  is anti-inflammatory in the first phase of inflammation, its role in the later phases
  of chronic inflammation requires further research. Figure created using BioRender
