caption: Knockout of DJ-1 suppresses tumor growth in vivo. (A, B). DNA sequencing
  and Western Blot verified that DJ-1 was knocked out in MG63 cells. (C, D). MG63
  DJ-1 WT and DJ-1 KO cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice and tumor
  weight was recorded. (E–M). RNA expression of CCNA1, CCNE1, CDK2, RRM2, FOXM1, TVMS,
  CHK1, p53 and p73. The original uncut western bands are shown in . **P < 0.01; ***P
  < 0.001.
