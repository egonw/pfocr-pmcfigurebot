caption: 'In vitro validation based on SH-SY5Y cells. (a-b) Viability of SH-SY5Y cells
  after being treated with SHCJ, quercetin, and Aβ25-35, based on CCK8 assays. (c)
  Annexin V-FITC/PI staining was used for analyzing apoptosis which was quantified
  as the apoptosis rate. (d-e) The effects of quercetin on PI3K/AKT pathway protein
  expression and apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells treated with Aβ25-35. The data represent
  the mean ± SEM. n = 3. ++P < 0.01 vs. control; ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. Aβ25-35;
  #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 vs. Aβ25-35 + quercetin.'
