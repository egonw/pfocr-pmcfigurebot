figure_title: Major STING combinatorial approaches with additive or synergistic effects
caption: 1) Radiation/chemotherapy and 2) demethylation agents that enhance downstream
  STING activation either through increasing cytoplasmic DNA (radiation) or decreasing
  STING promoter methylation (demethylating agents). Other immunotherapies (3 and
  4) are synergistic therapies that focus on increasing net STING function and antitumor
  response through either decreasing anti-inflammatory cytokines (STAT3 inhibition)
  that at baseline thwart STING response or decreasing T cell deactivation and exhaustion
  (anti-PD-1/PD-L1). Created with BioRender.com.
