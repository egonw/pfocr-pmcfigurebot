caption: STRING analysis of common EV proteins. The common 948 EV proteins which were
  present in all eight cell lines were imported to STRING for enrichment analysis
  based on biological process (A), molecular function (B), KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes) pathway (C), and reactome (D). Only the top ten enrichment
  terms based on false discovery rate were presented.
