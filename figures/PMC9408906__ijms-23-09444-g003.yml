caption: Exogenous ATP activated the Akt-mTOR transduction pathway in mouse FDB muscles.
  Kinetics of Akt phosphorylation (A) and S6 phosphorylation (B) evoked by ATP. Isolated
  FDB muscles were incubated with 100 µM ATP for 0–20 min. (C) Exogenous ATP evoked
  a concentration-dependent increase in Akt phosphorylation. FDB muscles were incubated
  for 10 min with 0–100 µM ATP. (D–F) 3 µM ATP evoked phosphorylation of mTOR (D),
  p70S6K (E) and 4E-BP1 (F) in isolated FDB muscles. Proteins from whole muscle extracts
  were resolved by SDS/PAGE (upper panels in each figure). Graphs in the bottom panels
  correspond to densitometric quantitation of 3–4 independent experiments (mean ±
  SEM), expressed as relative protein levels of phosphorylated proteins to the non-phosphorylated
  form (A–D) or GAPDH (E,F). * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001. Kruskal–Wallis
  test followed by Bonferroni post hoc, comparing each stimulation against the 0 (A–C).
  Mann–Whitney test, control vs ATP for each time (D–F).
