caption: Generated patient‐specific induced pluripotent stem cell‐derived cardiomyocytes
  (pt‐iPSC‐CMs) show a functional cardiomyocyte phenotype. (A) Representative image
  of normal karyotype of iPSC lines by G‐band analysis. (B) Representative phase‐contrast
  image. (C) Confirmation of sufficient purification after metabolic purification
  using CM detector RNA switch. EGFP is expressed in cells other than cardiomyocytes
  (upper row). (D) Images of immunostaining with DAPI (blue), cardiac troponin‐T (cTnT;
  green) and α‐actinin (red). (E) Expression of western blot of ErbB2, ErbB4, cTnT,
  and α‐actinin receptors. MB231 was used as a negative control and SK‐BR‐3 as a positive
  control for ErbB2. (F) Recording of Ca2+ transients observed with the Ca2+ indicator,
  Cal520. (G) Electrophysiological activities of spontaneously beating pt‐iPSC‐CMs
  and enlarged single beat profile using the multielectrode array. (H) Membrane potential
  recording showing cardiomyocyte‐specific action potentials recorded with the voltage
  sensitive dye, FluoVolt. F.I., fluorescence intensity
