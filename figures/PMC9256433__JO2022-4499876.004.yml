caption: 'miR-146a-5p carried by EVs enhances cervical cancer metastasis through suppressing
  WWC2. (a) RT-qPCR determination of miR-146a-5p and WWC2 expression in C33A cells.
  (b) Transwell assay of the invasion and migration of C33A cells. (c) The adhesion
  of C33A cells to the extracellular matrix. (d) TUNEL staining of apoptosis of C33A
  cells. (e) Western blot assay of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and Vimentin protein expression
  in C33A cells. (f) The in vivo fluorescence imaging of nude mice injected with 5 × 105
  stable luciferase-labeled C33A cells through the tail vein, n = 8. (g) H&E staining
  of lung tissues of nude mice and the number of metastatic nodes in the lung, scale
  bar: 50 μm. (h) Survival curve of nude mice, n = 8. The data in the Figure were
  measurement data and expressed as mean ± standard deviation. The comparison among
  multiple groups was performed by a one-way analysis of variance (Dunnett''s post
  hoc test). ∗p < 0.05. Cell experiments were repeated 3 times independently.'
