caption: 'A crosstalk of HO-1 and Notch1 signaling in Mφ(A and B) Immunostaining with
  antibody against Notch1 total was performed in the livers isolated from Hmox1flfl
  or LysM-Cre:Hmox1flfl (Cre:Hmox1flfl) mice after BDL surgery. Scale bar: 100 μm
  (insets: 400x magnification). The quantification of a number of Notch1+ cells is
  shown in (B). Data are represented as mean ± SEM. ANOVA, p < 0.001, Tukey’s multiple
  comparison test: ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗∗p < 0.001.(C–E) LysM-Cre:RiboTag (Hmox1flfl) or LysMCre:Hmox1flfl:
  RiboTag (Cre:Hmox1flfl) mice were subjected to BDL surgery as in . RT-PCR was performed
  using RNA isolated from the immunoprecipitates with the anti-HA antibody. Data are
  represented as mean ± SEM. ANOVA, p < 0.0001, Tukey’s multiple comparison test:
  ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ∗∗p < 0.01. n = 5–18 female and male mice per group.(F) Scheme representing
  the interaction of LNX1 in HO-1 and regulation of Mφ phenotype during liver injury.'
