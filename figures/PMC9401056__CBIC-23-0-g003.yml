caption: In vivo synthesis of methylated IPP and DMAPP derivatives in E. coli strains
  expressing one of the prenyl pyrophosphate MTase genes. E. coli MG1655 (DE3) ΔrecA
  ΔendA ΔtnaA strains containing the mevalonate pathway plasmid pLD‐03 and additionally
  containing pPJH‐1 (humMT), pPJH‐2 (fasMT), pPJH‐3 (catMT), pPJH‐4 (fraMT), pPJH‐5
  (azuMT), pPJH‐6 (argMT) or pMK‐24 (monMT) were cultivated as described in the material
  and methods section. The strain used for the control experiment contained pLD‐03
  and pET28a(+). The alcohol derivatives of respective prenyl pyrophosphates were
  detected by headspace‐SPME‐GC‐MS analyses and products were identified by comparison
  of the obtained mass spectra with mass spectra of reference compounds (Figure S4)
  as well as retention times (Figure S3). Shown are representative TIC chromatograms
  after several repetitions of the experiments.
