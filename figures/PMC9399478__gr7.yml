caption: Chronic deletion of hepatic p53 in adult mice induces a compensational activation
  of the glycogen synthesis pathway. Male mice were treated as depicted in (A) and
  (B) hepatic p53 protein of re-fed mice analyzed by immunoblotting. C, blood glucose
  and (D) hepatic glycogen and triglycerides in re-fed mice were determined. E, serum
  insulin levels of re-fed mice were analyzed. F, phosphorylated glycogen synthase
  (GYS) in total liver protein of re-fed mice was determined by immunoblotting. G,
  densitometric analysis P-GYS protein in re-fed mice. H, hepatic mRNA expression
  of p53 and indicated genes related to glycogen synthesis in re-fed mice were analyzed
  by qPCR. Data are presented as individual data points and mean ± SEM and with ∗p <
  0.05 versus mice with liver-specific GFP expression.
