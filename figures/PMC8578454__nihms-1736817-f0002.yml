figure_title: Identification of functional domains in dHb-IPN pathway during spontaneous
  activity
caption: '(A) Schematic of dHb-IPN pathway of larval zebrafish. Non-cholinergic (nCh,
  red) neurons are mainly in the left dHb and project to the dorsal IPN (d) whereas
  cholinergic (Ch, green) neurons are largely in the right dHb and project to the
  ventral IPN (v) and raphe (bracket). Somatostatinergic neurons are depicted in blue.
  Anterior (a), posterior (p), left (L) and right (R).(B, F, J) Representative 6 day
  post fertilization (dpf) Tg(gng8:GAL4ff)c426;Tg(UAS:GCaMP7a) brain explants expressing
  GCaMP in dHb neurons (B), left dHb and their terminals (F) and terminals at the
  IPN and raphe (J), overlaid by colored circles representing functional domains identified
  by k-means clustering. Dotted line depicts the fasciculus retroflexus (FR) in (F).(C,
  G, L) Correlation matrix of average ΔF/F signals between different clusters of dHb
  soma (C), dHb soma and terminals (G) and terminals at the IPN and raphe (L).(D,
  H, M) Average ΔF/F traces from each cluster in 10-minute recordings. Colored boxed
  events in (D) correspond to single frame images in .(E, I, P) Average ΔF/F traces
  (black) of individual calcium events (grey).(E) Traces of green/blue neurons exhibiting
  synchronized activity. n = 6 explants, 29 events. See .(I) Traces of calcium bursts
  in the ventral dHb and dHb terminals at the vIPN and raphe (green, blue). Note that
  dHb terminals at the dIPN exhibit inhibition (trace 4). n = 5 explants, 24 events.
  See .(P) Traces of negatively correlated events in dHb terminals at the IPN and
  raphe. n = 6 explants, 35 calcium events. See .(K) Lateral view of dHb terminals
  expressing GCaMP7a at the IPN and raphe (green arrowheads) before and during a calcium
  burst event.(N,O) Single frame images showing calcium signal changes. Blue (N) and
  green (O) boxed events in (M) are shown. Areas with increased (white) or decreased
  (green) signals are outlined (dotted lines). Right panels show traces in the IPN
  and raphe during the calcium event on left. n = 21/23 explants show similar calcium
  signaling domains. Scale bars: 20 μm (B,J) or 50 μm (F). See also –.'
