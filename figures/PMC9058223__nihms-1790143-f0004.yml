figure_title: Aerobic glycolysis and G6PD do not maintain human mesothelioma cell
  survival in vitro
caption: 'A. Tumor cells were cultured in the presence of the indicated concentrations
  of GSK2837808A for 24h. Cells were stained with PI and analyzed by flow cytometry.
  % cell death is calculated as % PI+ cells and presented at the bottom panels. Shown
  are results of one of two experiments. Cycle: Mean, Bar: SD. B. Tumor cells were
  cultured in the presence of the indicated concentrations of G6PDi-1 for 24h. Cells
  were stained with PI and analyzed by flow cytometry. % cell death is calculated
  as % PI+ cells and presented at the right panels. Shown are results of one of two
  experiments. Cycle: Mean, Bar: SD.'
