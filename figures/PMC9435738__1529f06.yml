caption: 'TF footprints stratify ATAC-STARR-deﬁned regulatory regions into gene regulatory
  networks. (A) ATAC-STARR-deﬁned chromatin accessibility, TF footprints, and regulatory
  regions at Chr 19: 35,611,232–35,798,446 (hg38). Signal tracks represent counts
  per million normalized read depth of chromatin accessibility. Zooms into ETV2 and
  ZBTB32 show that some regulatory regions are occupied by a SP1, KLF3, IRF8, or NFKB1
  footprint. (B,C) Heat maps of clustered (B) active and (C) silent regions based
  on presence or absence of footprints for select TF motif archetypes. (D,E) Reactome
  pathway enrichment analysis for nearest-neighbor gene sets for each of the clusters.
  Genes counts for each cluster are displayed below their group identifier.'
