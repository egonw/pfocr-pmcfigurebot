figure_title: Network-based visualization of 105 predicted ALS-associated genes
caption: Prioritized ALS-associated genes are colored with various evidence. Yellow
  genes are the ones identified by GisGeNET with an association score ≥ 0.1. Blue
  genes are the ones enriched in KEGG pathway. Purple geens are the ones detailed
  in Diseases JansenLab database with a Z-score ≥ 3. Red Genes are the ones identified
  by enrichment analysis from other ALS-relavant literature.
