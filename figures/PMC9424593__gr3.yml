caption: 'DEGs of CCND1-related pathway from extracellular adenosine treated macrophages.
  (A) Comparative RNA-seq analysis of untreated and adenosine (200 μM)-treated human
  macrophages. Genes most significantly influenced by adenosine treatment: CCND1-related
  (54 genes). (B) Results of the GO enrichment analysis of total DEGs from extracellular
  adenosine-treated human macrophages compared with untreated macrophages. Data have
  been presented as mean ± standard error of the mean. ∗∗∗P < .001 (Student t test).'
