caption: Results of drug-disease network relationship analysis using network pharmacology
  methods. (A) Drug-disease Venny intersection diagram, with the drug (Sanchi) targets
  on the left, the disease (RIRI) targets on the right, and the two intersection targets
  in the middle; (B) GO enrichment analysis of drug-disease; (C) Hub genes screened
  according to the PPI network relationships and rounded from the largest to smallest
  with the Degree value changes, and Degree–hub genes histogram with the Degree values
  as horizontal coordinates and genes as vertical coordinates; (D) KEGG signaling
  pathway analysis of drug-disease; (E) PPI network relationship diagram; (F) The
  network of “disease-drug active ingredient-key target-KEGG signaling pathway”, from
  left to right, is the disease (RIRI), drug (Sanchi) and its seven active ingredients
  Mol numbers, key targets (blue outer circle), and the first ten pathways of KEGG.
