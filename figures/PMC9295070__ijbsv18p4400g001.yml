caption: 'A simplified view of the structure and transduction process of NF-κB. (A)
  Structures of the members of the NF-κB signaling pathway. ① The NF-κB superfamily
  contains five members: RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, NF-κB1 (p105/p50), and NF-κB2 (p100/p52).
  p50 and p52 are shorter forms processed by p105 and p100, respectively. All members
  share a Rel homology domain (RHD), which contains two specific DNA-binding domains
  (DBDs) and a nuclear localization sequence. One of the DBDs is engaged in DNA recognition,
  and the other is involved in dimerization. ② The IκB family contains the three most
  important members: IKBα, IKBβ, and IKBγ. ③ The IKK complex contains the three most
  important members. GRR: glycine-rich region; ANK: ankyrin repeats; DD: death domain;
  TAD: transcription activation domain; LZ: leucine zipper domain; KD: kinase domain;
  HLH: helix-loop-helix domain; NBD: NEMO-binding domain; MOD/UBD: minimal oligomerization
  domain/ubiquitin-binding domain; ZF: zinc finger domain. (B) NF-κB signaling is
  activated in endometriotic cells. Stimuli, such as TNF-α and IL1, activate the IKK
  complex, triggering IKB phosphorylation and its subsequent proteasomal degradation.
  The RelA/p50 heterodimers then translocate to the nucleus and elicit transcriptional
  activity. Estrogen, progesterone, oxidative stress, and ncRNAs are the key regulators
  of NF-κB signaling, and the effects of estrogen on NF-κB signaling are controversial.
  Activation of the downstream genes of NF-κB signaling induces inflammatory responses
  and supports the survival, adhesion, migration, and invasion of endometriotic cells
  during endometriosis development.'
