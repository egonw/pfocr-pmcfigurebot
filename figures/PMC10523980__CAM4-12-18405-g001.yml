caption: Differentially expressed genes included in significant pathways associated
  with current versus never low‐dose aspirin use in type II ovarian tumors. (A) Differentially
  expressed inflammation and immune‐related pathway genes that are associated with
  current versus never low‐dose aspirin use in type II ovarian tumors. Within the
  significant pathways (i.e., interferon‐gamma response, chemokine signaling pathway,
  chemokine receptors bind chemokine, cytokine‐cytokine receptor interaction, allograft
  rejection, immunoregulatory interactions between a lymphoid and a nonlymphoid cell,
  primary immunodeficiency, antigen activates B‐cell receptor BCR leading to generation
  of second messengers, and FCGR activation), individual genes that were associated
  with current low‐dose aspirin use with unadjusted p‐value <0.10 were included in
  the heatmap. (B) Differentially expressed estrogen‐related pathway genes that are
  associated with current versus never low‐dose aspirin use in type II ovarian tumors.
  Within the significant pathways (i.e., estrogen response late and estrogen response
  early), individual genes associated with current low‐dose aspirin use with unadjusted
  p‐value<0.10 were included in the heatmap.
