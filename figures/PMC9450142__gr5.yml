caption: 'Detection of HO-1+ and LNX1+ cells in the human samples with increasing
  fibrosis stage and assessment of the role of HO-1 in myeloid cells in fibrosis progression
  in murine NASH model(A–D) IHC staining with antibodies against LNX1 or HO-1 in (A) human
  liver biopsies from n = 5 patients with various stages of NAFLD/NASH with the clinical
  characteristic as described in . (B–D) Human liver explants obtained from patients
  undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation due to end-stage liver disease of various
  etiologies (n = 3 PBC, n = 5 Alc, n = 5 Crypt) (). Representative staining in myeloid
  cells/macrophages is shown in (A) and (B). Scale bar: 100 μm (A) and 50 μm (B).
  Quantification of the HO-1+ and LNX1+ cells are shown in (C) and (D). Data are represented
  as mean ± SEM. ANOVA, not significant.(E–G) Hmox1flfl (Hmox1flfl) or LysM-Cre:Hmox1flfl
  (Cre:Hmox1flfl) mice were fed with methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet
  for 3 weeks. Livers were evaluated for fibrosis and fatty scores based on the Sirius
  red staining and H&E. Data are represented as mean ± SEM. Student’s t test: ∗p < 0.05.
  n = 10 mice/group. Scale bar: 100 μm.'
