caption: Effect of VOdipic-Cl on the expression of hepatic triglyceride synthesis
  and lipolysis genes in obese mice. (A) Schematic of the hepatic de novo lipogenesis
  pathway, where genes are presented in pink and metabolites in green. (B,C) GSEA-KEGG
  gene set enrichment analysis plot showing the DEGs in the RCD vs. HFD group mainly
  enriched in fatty acid metabolism and PPAR signaling pathway. (D) The gene expression
  profiles of the DEGs that were mainly enriched in lipid metabolic pathways, as determined
  by KEGG pathway analysis, are shown in the heat map. (E,F) The mRNA levels of lipid
  synthesis- and lipolysis-related genes. (G,H) The protein levels of genes are related
  to lipid metabolism. Data are presented as mean Â± SD (n = 3). * p < 0.05, ** p <
  0.01, *** p < 0.001.
