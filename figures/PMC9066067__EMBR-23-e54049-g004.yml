figure_title: Intra‐epithelial non‐canonical Activin A signaling mediates the Tgf‐β‐induced
  cytostatic response in mouse prostate organoids
caption: 'Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry (EdU vs. TO‐PRO‐3) in complete medium
  (ENRAD) or in the absence of A83‐01 (24 h).Detection of proteins secreted by mouse
  prostate organoids in culture based on click‐chemistry enrichment and mass spectrometry
  analysis (n = 4 biological replicates; data points are shown with crossing line
  representing mean value).IF analysis for selected markers in mouse prostate tissue
  and organoid sections (scale bar = 50 μm).Representative stereoscopic images of
  mouse prostate organoids cultured in the absence of A83‐01, with or without Follistatin
  (Fst, 500 ng/ml, 6 days), or with or without the Activin A neutralizing antibody
  MAB3381 (1 μg/ml, 6 days). Scale bar = 1 mm.Western blot (WB) analysis in mouse
  prostate organoids for selected canonical and non‐canonical Tgf‐β signaling mediators,
  and the cell cycle inhibitor p21 (Activin A, 50 ng/ml; Tgfb1, 500 ng/ml; 24 h).Schematic
  view of the non‐canonical Activin A pathway, including inhibitors used for the experiments
  described in this figure.Representative stereoscopic images of mouse prostate organoids
  following treatment with Takinib (Tak1 inhibitor; 5 μM, 6 days), SB203580 (p38α/β
  inhibitor; 10 μM, 6 days) or the structurally unrelated Ralimetinib (p38α/β inhibitor;
  1 μM, 7 days). Scale bar = 1 mm.Nuclear/Cytoplasmic fractionation and Western blot
  analysis in mouse prostate organoids for selected signaling mediators in the presence
  or absence of SB203580 (p38α/β inhibitor; 10 μM, 24 h).Gene set enrichment analysis
  (GSEA) plots displaying significant enrichment for inflammatory response and tumor
  necrosis factor (TNF) signaling in mouse prostate organoids cultured without A83‐01
  (24 h) vs. complete medium (ENRAD).Nuclear/Cytoplasmic fractionation and western
  blot analysis in mouse prostate organoids for selected cell cycle regulators, in
  the presence or absence of SB203580 (p38α/β inhibitor; 10 μM, 24 or 48 h). Data
  information: In (A) quantification of cells in S‐phase for n = 3 biological replicates
  are presented in Appendix Fig A. Source data are available online for this figure.'
