caption: Epithelial cells harbour a subset of cancer stem cells and show heterogeneity
  of DNA copy number variations. (A) Differentiation status of malignant cells analysed
  by CytoTRACE. (B) RNA velocity of malignant cells. (C) Differentiation trajectory
  of malignant cells, with each colour coded for clusters (left) and pseudo‐time (right).
  (D) Expression of FOSL1 in malignant cells was shown in the tSNE view. (E) The expression
  of EPCAM, TRIM29 and DKK1 was shown with violin plots. (F) Multiplex immunofluorescence
  staining of LC tissue. (G) Candidate drugs that target AREG and F3 in C3 or G6PD
  in C8 of malignant cells. (H) Bubble plots showed the expression of genes related
  to CIN was shown. (I) Expression of genes in CIN cells. (J) KEGG pathway of total
  epithelial cells enriched between PDL1 high compared with PDL1 low expression group.
  Circle means downregulated pathways and triangle means upregulated pathways. The
  dot represents the enriched gene number. (K) Expression of GATA6 was shown with
  violin plots and tSNE view. (L) Kaplan–Meier plots of overall survival (OS) for
  NSCLC patients with CTLs with the top and bottom TIDE prediction scores. The P value
  was calculated by testing the association between TIDE prediction scores and overall
  survival with the two‐sided Wald test in a Cox‐PH regression. (M) Expression of
  genes was shown with violin plots and tSNE view.
