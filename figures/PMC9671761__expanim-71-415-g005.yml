caption: Lysosomal-associated protein transmembrane 5 (LAPTM5) knockdown abates the
  activation of the NF-κB pathway at 3 days after myocardial infarction (MI). (A)
  The protein expression level of NF-κB p-p65, NF-κB p65, p-IκBα (Ser32) and IκBα
  in myocardial tissues in all groups of mice. (B) The immunofluorescence staining
  images of NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation. Red fluorescence indicates localization
  of p-p65, with the nuclei counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).
  a, b, c, d means sham, MI, MI+LV-shRNA-NC and MI+LV-shRNA-LAPTM5, respectively.
  Statistical evaluation was performed by one-way analysis of variance with Tukey
  post hoc test. Data were expressed as mean ± SD. **P<0.01. n=6 for each group.

  cardiac function and inflammatory response by inhibiting the nuclear factor-kappa
