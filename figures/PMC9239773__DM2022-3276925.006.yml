caption: The forkhead box O (FOXO) protein family regulates the expression of genes
  in cellular physiological events including apoptosis, tumor angiogenesis, glucose
  metabolism, oxidative stress resistance, and DNA damage repair. PI3K-Akt signaling
  pathway is activated in response to CXCR4/CXCL12 activation. Then, FOXO proteins
  are phosphorylation by the serine/threonine kinase (AKT)/protein kinase B (PKB).
  Phosphorylated FOXOs result in the export of FOXOs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm,
  thereby decreasing expression of FOXO target genes. Other posttranslational modifications
  of FOXO include methylation, acetylation, ubiquitylation, and glycosylation.
