caption: 'Wedelolactone (WEL) and demethylwedelolactone (DWEL) extensively altered
  gene expression patterns in zebrafish liver. (A) Venn diagram analysis of the total
  differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in three comparisons: non-alcoholic fatty
  liver disease (NAFLD) group vs. control group, WEL treatment groups vs. NAFLD group
  and DWEL treatment groups vs. NAFLD group. (B, C) The statistics of DEGs that up-and
  down-regulated were showed by colored columns (B) and volcano plot (C). (D) Stacking
  histogram of fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM)
  values of the genes in each sample. (E) Heatmap of the 71 DEGs overlapped among
  the three comparisons. (F) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway
  enrichment analysis of DEGs in WEL and DWEL treatment groups vs. NAFLD group.'
