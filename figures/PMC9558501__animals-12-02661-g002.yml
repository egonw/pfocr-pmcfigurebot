caption: Depicted are cell populations with possible expression of the immune checkpoint
  molecules PD-L1 and PD-1. Notably, these molecules are upregulated by IFNγ. The
  binding between PD-L1 and PD-1 inhibits the functions of the PD-1-bearing target
  cell. DC = dendritic cell; M = macrophage; TC = tumor cell; EC = endothelial cell;
  Treg = regulatory T cell; Breg = regulatory B cell; B = B cell, Th1 = T helper 1
  cell; Th2 = T helper 2 cell; cyTC = cytotoxic T cell; NK = natural killer cell;
  γδT = γδ T cell.
