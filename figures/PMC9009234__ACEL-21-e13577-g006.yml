caption: Maintenance of the rejuvenated aging‐associated phenotypes after induction
  of OSKM. (a) Cultured primary 4F aging NPCs were treated with doxycycline (1 μg/ml)
  for 4 days (dox4d); 4 days and stopped for 4 days (dox4d‐4d); 4 days and stopped
  for 8 days (dox4d‐8d); 4 days and stopped for 4 days and then treated for 4 days
  (dox4d‐4d+4d). Levels of sox9 were determined by Western blotting. (b–e) qPCR analysis
  of stress response genes in the p53 pathway in 4F aging NPCs after doxycycline treatment.
  (f,h) Immunofluorescence and quantification of γH2AX expression in 4F aging NPCs
  after doxycycline treatment. Scale bar, 25 μm. (g,i) Immunofluorescence and quantification
  of γH2AX and H3K9me3 expression in 4F aging NPCs after doxycycline treatment. Scale
  bar, 25 μm. (j) Levels of ROS in 4F aging NPCs after doxycycline treatment. (k)
  Proliferation of aging NPCs cultured in inducing OSKM lasting 2 or 4 days as determined
  by EdU incorporation. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001, according
  to one‐way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction. Data are presented as mean ± SEM
