caption: 'Multi-level specificity analyses for tau-related pathology and autophagy.
  Arrows connect sub-parts (higher specificity) to part (lower specificity). a) Tau
  aggregation is a specific instance of protein aggregation, observed in many pathologies
  []. “Tau” is neurodegenerative-level. Tau filaments are composed of different isoforms:
  AD filaments contain all six isoforms expressed in the human brain, while progressive
  supranuclear palsy filaments contain only four-repeat isoforms []. Recent structural
  studies using cryo-electron microscopy have characterized tau filaments with unique
  structures associated with disease []. Although a single conformer is described
  per disease for now, converging evidence suggests that tau strains could be unique
  to single patients or subsets []. Likewise, the profile of post-translational modifications
  (PTMs) may be specific to AD and to certain subgroups of AD patients []. Tau seeding
  activity is different between subtypes of AD patients (slow and fast progressers)
  [], and four distinct trajectories of tau deposition have been identified in AD
  []. b) Autophagy is influenced by ageing and nutritional status [], and autophagy
  dysfunction is observed in many pathologies, including AD []. Genetic alteration
  of murine autophagy alters neuronal proteostasis, resembling neurodegenerative conditions
  []. Mammals exhibit three coordinate and partially compensatory forms of autophagy,
  which differ in lysosomal cargo delivery mechanisms: macroautophagy, chaperone-mediated
  autophagy (CMA), and microautophagy. Because of more abundant literature on them,
  we consider only macroautophagy and CMA. There are signatures of autophagy impairments
  in AD and other diseases at different levels []. Specificity increases between pathways
  (macroautophagy/CMA) and steps within a given pathway (orange text).'
