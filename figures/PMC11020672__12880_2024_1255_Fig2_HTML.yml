caption: Lymph node status in image cohorts. (A) 145 LN distribution of invasive breast
  cancer. There was no statistically significant difference between cohorts (chi-square
  test, P = 0.08). (B) Typical LNM example. Deep learning phenotypes were based on
  2D image extraction, radiomics phenotypes were based on 3D image extraction
article_title: Lymph node metastasis prediction and biological pathway associations
  underlying DCE-MRI deep learning radiomics in invasive breast cancer.
