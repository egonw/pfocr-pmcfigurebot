caption: 'Artificial particulate matter (APM) and diesel exhaust particles (DEP) induce
  oxidative stress in alveolar macrophages (MH−S). (A) Cytotoxicity of N−Acetyl Cysteine
  (NAC). (B) Reactive oxygen species level was measured using 2′,7′−dichlorofluorescein
  diacetate (DCF−DA) staining. Negative controls (NC) are untreated samples. MH−S
  was pretreated with NAC for 3 h and was stimulated with 100 μg/mL APM or DEP for
  3 h. Data are presented as the means ± SD (n = 4 per group). ** p < 0.01, or ***
  p < 0.001 vs. NC; ### p < 0.001 vs. APM; §§§ p < 0.001 vs. DEP group.'
