figure_title: shATM does not prevent the G1 arrest upon FLT3 inhibition
caption: 'MOLM-13 cells expressing shNT or shATM were treated with the indicated conditions
  for 15 hr and labeled with 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU). Cells were stained with
  propidium iodide (PI) to measure DNA content, followed by cell cycle analysis using
  flow cytometry (S-phase: EdU+; G1/G0-phase: EdU-/low PI,;G2/M-phase: EdU-/high PI)
  (n = 3). Statistical analysis was performed for S phase.'
article_title: Therapeutic resistance in acute myeloid leukemia cells is mediated
  by a novel ATM/mTOR pathway regulating oxidative phosphorylation.
