caption: 'The expression of NEAT1, miR-101 and VEGF-C in an orthotopic bladder cancer
  model. A The results of immunohistochemical staining showed that VEGF-C expression
  was significantly increased in the NEAT1 group (the immunohistochemical positive
  cell is marked by the black arrow), **p < 0.01. NEAT1 group versus CON and NC groups
  (magnification × 200). B The expression of NEAT1 and VEGF-C mRNAs were significantly
  increased after NEAT1 transfection. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 NEAT1 group versus CON
  and NC groups. The expression of miR-101 mRNA was significantly decreased after
  NEAT1 transfection. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 NEAT1 group versus CON and NC groups.
  C The expression of VEGF-C protein was significantly increased after NEAT1 transfection (Additional
  file : Figure S4). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 NEAT1 group versus CON and NC groups'

  the miR-101/VEGF-C pathway in vitro and in vivo.
