caption: 'Molecular feature-based survival prediction model of ovarian cancer (OC)
  using deep neural network. (A) Overall workflow. The workflow includes four steps:
  Step 1, dataset preparation; Step 2, data preprocessing and survival-related feature
  selection; Step 3, Patient clustering; Step 4, model development and verification.
  In step 1, the whole dataset compose of miRNA and mRNA data in The Cancer Genome
  Atlas was prepared. In step 2, the data were preprocessed followed by survival-related
  features. In step 3, the patients were optimally grouped into 6 subgroups with three
  different survival outcomes. In step 4, the trained and integrated models were subsequently
  developed, followed by verification by individually inputting original data for
  mimicking reality. (B) Heatmap presenting the expression profile of 327 survival-related
  mRNAs/miRNAs in OC solid tumor samples. The median survival times of the grouped
  patients were shown. (C) The Silhouette coefficient was used to select the optimal
  parameters for patient clustering. (D) The patients were optimally clustered into
  6 subgroups with three different survival outcomes (high, moderate, and poor survival)
  according to 13 survival-related features. (E) Heatmap presenting the expression
  profile of 13 survival-related features used in optimal clustering in OC solid tumor
  samples. The median survival times of each subgroup were shown. (F) Score plot of
  unsupervised principal component analysis overview of 13 survival-related features
  among the high, moderate, and poor survival groups. (G) Receiver operating characteristic
  (ROC) curve for trained prediction model to discriminate between high, moderate,
  and poor survival groups through preprocessed data. (H) ROC curve for integrated
  prediction model to discriminate between high, moderate, and poor survival groups
  through individually inputted original data. (I) Pathway enrichment analysis of
  13 survival-related mRNAs used in the prediction model was visualized by a chord
  diagram.'
