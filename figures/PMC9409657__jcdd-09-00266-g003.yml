caption: '(A) The representative protein levels of caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3
  from the left ventricles in the normotensive group (WKY), untreated hypertensive
  group (SHR), and SHR rats with treated irbesartan (SHR-ARB), as measured by Western
  blot methods. α-Tubulin served as an internal control. (B) Bars indicate the relative
  fold changes of protein levels relative to the Control group in active caspase-8,
  caspase-9, and caspase-3 on α-Tubulin and mean ± standard deviation (n = 8;8;8).
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01: significant differences from the Control group. # p < 0.05,
  ## p < 0.01 indicates significant differences between the SHR group and the SHR-ARB
  group.'
