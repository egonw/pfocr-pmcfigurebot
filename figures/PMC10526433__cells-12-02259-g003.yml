caption: Hypothetical model representing cellular processes elicited in L. dendroidea
  in response to microbes. The first steps of terpenoid biosynthesis occur through
  mevalonate (MVA) or methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways, taking place in cytoplasm
  and chloroplasts, respectively. Corps en cerise (CC) development depends on the
  Golgi secretory pathway. ABCB transporters are responsible for importing terpenoid
  precursors to the lumen of CC. ABCD transporters import long-chain fatty acids to
  peroxisomes where Î² oxidation occurs, providing alternative sources of energy for
  defensive metabolism. ABCF proteins participate in stress response acting on protein
  synthesis and ribosome assembly. ABCG is involved in the exudation of specialized
  metabolites across the cell membrane. Vesicles budding from CC [,,,] are transported
  through microfilaments (red) until the cell periphery and positioned in regions
  where exocytosis will occur through microtubules (green) [], thus inhibiting biofouling
  [].
