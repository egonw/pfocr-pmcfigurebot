caption: Following SARS-Cov2 infection, the initial immune response is altered with
  an activation of the NF-κB and inflammasome (NRLP3) pathways, while the production
  of interferon type I (IFN–I) is delayed. Activation of the NF-κB and inflammasome
  pathways lead to ACE2 (SARS-Cov2 receptor) overexpression that reinforces viral
  infection, and contributes to an exuberant inflammatory response known as a cytokine
  storm, at the onset of tissue damage, and the promotion of the autoreactive extrafolicular
  pathway. In contrast, IFN-I capacity to control the viral spread, innate and acquired
  immune response is affected.
