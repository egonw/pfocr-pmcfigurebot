caption: IFNγ induces IFI35 via STAT1/IRF7. A–E Treatment of murine colon cancer cells
  with IFNγ induced the expression of IFI35. A–D RNA was extracted from murine colon
  cancer cells after IFNγ (10 ng/mL), LPS (200 ng/mL), Poly AD (5 µg/mL), and poly
  IC (5 µg/mL) treatment for 16 h. n = 3. Error bars represent the mean ± SEM. Two
  tailed t-tests, *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001. E Cell supernatant was subjected to western
  blot analysis for IFI35 after treatment with IFNγ (10 ng/mL), LPS (200 ng/mL), Poly
  AD (5 µg/mL), and poly IC (5 µg/mL) for 48 h. F, G Expression of IFI35 mRNA by RT-qPCR
  in CT26 and MC38 CRC cells transfected with control siRNA or one different siRNA
  sequence targeting IRF7 (si-IRF7) and then untreated or treated with IFNγ alone
  or in combination with STAT1 inhibitor Fludarabine. n = 3. Error bars represent
  the mean ± SEM. Two tailed t-tests, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.
  H–K Correlation between IFI35 and STAT1 (H) or IRF7 (I) in COAD. Correlation between
  STAT1 (J) or IRF7 (K) expression and CD8+ T-cell expression in COAD
