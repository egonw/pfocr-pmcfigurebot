caption: 'Effect of oxaliplatin resistance on AMPK and Akt/mTOR signaling pathway
  in the parental (PT), 2.5 μM oxaliplatin single treated PT for 24 h (ST) and oxaliplatin-resistant
  (OR) colorectal cancer (CRC) cells of HCT116, HT29, SW480 and SW620. (A) Protein
  expression was determined by immunoblot analysis. (B) Graphical analysis of band
  intensities normalized for protein loading with GAPDH. Columns and error bars represent
  means ± standards deviation of immunoblot band intensities of 3 separate protein
  preparations. The * statistics showed the comparison with PT and the # statistics
  showed the comparison between ST and OR. * or #, p < 0.05; ** or ##, p < 0.01; ***
  or ###, p < 0.001. p-, phospho-; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.'
