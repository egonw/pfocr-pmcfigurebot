caption: 'The effect of c‐Src knockdown on the UVB‐induced phosphorylation of MAPKs
  and COX‐2 expression in HaCaT cells. (A) Knockdown of c‐Src inhibits the UVB‐induced
  phosphorylation of EGFR at Tyr845 in HaCaT cells. (B) Knockdown of c‐Src inhibits
  the UVB‐induced COX‐2 expression in HaCaT cells. (C) Knockdown of c‐Src inhibits
  the UVB‐induced MAPKs signalling pathway in HaCaT cells; scr, scrambled siRNA. siRNA
  knockdown assay was described in the Materials and Methods section. The data represent
  the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. #p < 0.05 between the control group
  and the group exposed to UVB alone;**p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 between groups treated
  with scrambled siRNA and UVB and groups treated with c‐Src siRNA and UVB'

  c‐Src in vitro and in vivo.
