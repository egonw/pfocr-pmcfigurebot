caption: The non-canonical inflammasome pathway activates an endotoxic shock by stimulating
  LPS independently of TLR4 signaling. Caspase-11 plays a pivotal role in mice and
  caspases 4/5 in humans in this metabolic pathway. They can recognize and bind directly
  pent-acylated and hexa-acylated lipid A of the LPS without the mediation of TLR4.
  Subsequently, the caspases-4/5/11 provoke the cleavage of GSDMD, starting the process
  of pyroptosis. This phenomenon determines by caspase 11, the activation of pannexin-1,
  a channel protein that produces ATP. The release of ATP promotes the efflux of potassium.
  It is responsible for assembling NLRP3 inflammasome and the maturation and release
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
