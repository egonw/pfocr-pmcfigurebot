caption: 'Pathway classification of DEGs in SW/SFW group. X-axis represents the number
  of DEGs, and the Y-axis indicates the functional classification of KEGG that has
  been further classified into seven categories: cellular processed, environmental
  information processing, genetic information processing, human disease, metabolism,
  and organismal systems. The signaling transduction under the environmental information
  processing was enriched by the highest DEGs (72 genes). Immune system (45 genes)
  was the top enriched term in organismal systems.'
