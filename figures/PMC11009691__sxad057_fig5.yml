caption: CellChat identifies the cell-cell communication network in 3 KIT clusters.
  (A) The cell-cell interaction network among 3 KIT clusters. The size of dot is proportional
  to the number of cells in each cluster, and the width of the edges indicates the
  communication probability (numbers and interaction weights/strength) between the
  clustered cells. (B) The outgoing communication patterns of secreting cells, showing
  the correspondence between latent patterns and cell clusters as well as signaling
  pathways. (C) The incoming communication patterns of target cells with flow thickness
  that indicated the contribution of cell clusters or signaling pathways to each latent
  pattern. (D) Relative contribution of each ligand-receptor pair to the overall communication
  network of VEGF signaling pathway. (E) Violin plot showing gene expression of ligand-receptor
  pairs in the VEGF signaling pathway networks. (F) Chord diagram showing the secretory
  signal between KIT subgroups. Chords point from the VEGF ligand source to the cluster
  that expresses its partner receptor. The width of the chord shows the strength of
  the interaction. (G) Heatmap showing the role of each cluster as a sender, receiver,
  mediator, and influencer in the VEGF signaling pathway network. Colors represent
  the intensity of the communication signal. (H) Relative contribution of each ligand-receptor
  pair to the overall communication network of CXCL signaling pathway. (I) Violin
  plot showing gene expression of ligand-receptor pairs in the CXCL signaling pathway
  networks. (J) Chord diagram showing the secretory signal between KIT subgroups.
  Chords point from the CXCL ligand source to the cluster that expresses its partner
  receptor. The width of the chord shows the strength of the interaction. (K) Heatmap
  showing the role of each cluster as a sender, receiver, mediator, and influencer
  of CXCL signaling pathway network. Colors represent the strength of the communication
  signal. (L) Relative contribution of each ligand-receptor pair to the overall communication
  network of BMP signaling pathway. (M) Violin plot showing gene expression of ligand-receptor
  pairs in the BMP signaling pathway networks. (N) Chord diagram showing the secretory
  signal between KIT subgroups. Chords point from the BMP ligand source to the cluster
  that expresses its partner receptor. The width of the chord shows the strength of
  the interaction. (O) Heatmap showing the role of each cluster as a sender, receiver,
  mediator, and influencer of BMP signaling pathway network. Colors represent the
  strength of the communication signal.
