caption: 'Schematic of the factors affecting the alteration of the glioma microenvironment
  by extracellular matrices (ECMs) and enzymes. Basically, there are some types of
  ECM that are independent of glioma cell invasions. However, the alteration of the
  microenvironment surrounding gliomas is affected by ECMs and enzymes, which almost
  promote the invasiveness of glioma cells. There are mainly two signaling pathways
  subserving glioma cell invasion: the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator
  of transcription (STAT) pathway, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. Red arrows indicate the activation of signaling,
  while blue arrows indicate the inhibition of signaling. Abbreviation: ADAM; a disintegrin
  and metalloproteinase, ADAMTS; ADAM with thrombospondin domain, FNMA; fibronectin
  matrix assembly, HA; hyaluronic acid, MMP; matrix metalloproteinase, MT-MMP; membrane-type
  MMP, TIMP; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase, uPA; urokinase-type plasminogen
  activator, uPAR; uPA receptor.'
