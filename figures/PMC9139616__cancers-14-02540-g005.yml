caption: PI3K/AKT pathway contributes to Ang1-dependent ARP2/3 expression. (a) Protein
  interaction networks generated using STRING database version 11 showing the interaction
  between Ang1 (Angpt1), TIE2 (Tek), PI3Ks (PI3K), Akt (AKT1) and ARP2/3 subunits.
  (b,c) Western blotting of ARP2/3 expression in exposed MC38 or SW620 cancer cells
  to recombinant Ang1 in the presence or absence of PI3K/AKT inhibitor (LY294002).
  Right panels show the intensity of ARP2/3 bands that were quantified and normalized
  against GAPDH using ImageJ and represented as a fold change (n = 3). Data are presented
  as the mean Â± SD. ns = Not significant.
