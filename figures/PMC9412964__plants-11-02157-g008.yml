caption: Effects of BSA administration on the NH3 content of atg5 cells. Seven-day-old
  atg5 Physcomitrella colonies grown on a BCDAT agar medium were transferred to BCDATG
  liquid medium containing 2% (w/v) BSA or water (as a solvent control) and cultured
  for 1 d under light conditions. NH3 ions were measured immediately (0 d) and 1 d
  after transfer. Data are shown as means Â± SD (n = 3, *** p < 0.005).
