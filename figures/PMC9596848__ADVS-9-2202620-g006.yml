caption: 'CGRP is the primary DRG neuropeptide which responds to CHSY1 KO‐induced
  CS insufficiency. A) SDS‐PAGE analysis of total protein expression of mouse DRG
  cells supernatant from CHSY1 KO and littermates. B) Molecular weight distribution
  of mouse DRG cells supernatant total protein from CHSY1 KO and littermates. C) Isoelectric
  point distribution of mouse DRG cells supernatant total protein from CHSY1 KO and
  littermates. D) Unsupervised hierarchical cluster shows differentially expressed
  proteins in DRG from CHSY1 KO mice and their littermates. E) The GO enrichment analysis
  of mouse DRG secretome, differentially expressed proteins mainly related to synaptic
  transmission and immune response. F,G) The enriched pathway in mouse DRG secretome
  through Kegg analysis. H) Quantitative analysis of ELISA for CGRP concentration
  in DRG from CHSY1 KO and their littermates. I) Quantitative RT‐PCR analysis of DRG
  CALCA gene expression from CHSY1 KO and their littermates. J) Representative immunofluorescence
  staining of CGRP (green) and quantitative analysis for DRG from CHSY1 KO and their
  littermates. Scale bar: 10 µm. All data are means ± SEM, n = 6 per group, *P < 0.05.
  Statistical significance was determined by two‐tailed Student''s t‐test.'
