figure_title: USP7 deubiquitinates M1-, K6-, K11-, K27-, K33-, and K48-linked polyubiquitin
  chains of Raf-1
caption: A Schematic diagram of wild-type ubiquitin and its mutant constructs (M1,
  K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, and K63). B Ubiquitination assay of Raf-1 was performed
  in HEK293T cells transfected with Flag-Raf-1 and HA-Ub and treated with a proteasome
  inhibitor MG132. C HEK293T cells were transfected with Flag-Raf-1 and each HA-Ub
  mutant (K6, K11, K29, K33, and K48) and treated with a proteasome inhibitor MG132.
  And then ubiquitination assay of Raf-1 was performed for checking the association
  between the specific lysine sites of polyubiquitination and UPS. D Myc-USP7 and
  Flag-Raf-1 were transfected into HEK293T cells and Flag-Raf-1 was precipitated for
  deubiquitination assay. For checking the decrease of overall polyubiquitination
  of Raf-1 by DUB activity of USP7, deubiquitination assay was performed. E HEK293T
  cells were transfected with each HA-Ub mutant (M1, K6, K11, K27, K33, and K48) and
  Myc-USP7. A change in the polyubiquitin chains (M1, K6, K11, K27, K33, and K48)
  of Raf-1 by USP7 was detected through deubiquitination assay.
