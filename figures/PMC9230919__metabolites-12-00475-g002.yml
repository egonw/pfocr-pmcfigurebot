caption: Comparison of negative and positive gene SNPs on tissue folate levels in
  the groups used in the study metabolic profiles. Folate levels were not significantly
  different between controls and other groups with and without mutant SNPs in MTHFD1
  and/or MTHFR. The controls have a lower level of folate than the other groups, although
  this is not significant.
