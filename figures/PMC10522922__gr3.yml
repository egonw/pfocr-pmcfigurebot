caption: Diagnostic Considerations to Confirm No Standard Modifiable Cardiovascular
  Risk Factors, and to Screen for Nonstandard FactorsLess common risk factors for
  consideration in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) in the absence of standard
  modifiable cardiovascular risk factors (SMuRFS) (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,
  diabetes, and smoking) were identified by an international and multidisciplinary
  panel of cardiovascular disease experts. Dedicated clinical pathways and specialized
  clinics will ensure comprehensive investigation and evaluation of these factors
  in patients with SMuRFless atherosclerotic CAD as a novel strategy to optimize disease
  management and secondary prevention in this overlooked subgroup of the CAD population.
