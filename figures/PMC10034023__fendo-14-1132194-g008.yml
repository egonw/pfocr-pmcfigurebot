caption: Enrichment analyses of pyroptosis-related hub genes. (A) Enriched GO terms
  in the “cellular component” category. (B) Enriched GO terms in the “biological process”
  category. (C) Enriched GO terms in the “molecular function” category. (D) Top 10
  significantly enriched KEGG pathways of pyroptosis-related hub genes. (E) Abnormal
  expression of pyroptosis-related hub genes in maturity-onset diabetes of the young
  signaling pathway. (F) Enrichment map showing the top 5 pathways from pyroptosis
  score-based GSEA. X-axis represents enrichment score, and Y-axis represents pathway
  name. (G) Heatmap illustrating the enriched pathways between the low- and high-pyroptosis
  score groups as well as between the T2D and non-DM groups. Red represents upregulation,
  whereas green represents downregulation.
