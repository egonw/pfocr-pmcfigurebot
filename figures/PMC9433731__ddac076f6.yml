caption: Caspar’s ability to restrain age-dependent inflammation can delay the onset
  of disease, and this ability is independent of its interaction with VAP. (A) Mutations
  in the FFAT-like motif lead to disruption of the VAP:Caspar interaction. Caspar
  mutants were expressed in stable S2R+ lines expressing VAP:GFP. Affinity pull-downs
  using the anti-Caspar antibody could efficiently pull down VAP along with CasparWT.
  The antibody could, however, not pull down VAP efficiently in conditions when Caspar
  FFAT variants (AAA, EAE, ΔFFAT) were present. Protein bands that represent Caspar
  or VAP have been marked with a ‘*’, whereas nonspecific bands are marked with either
  ‘+’ or ‘++’. (B) Expression of the Rel target gene diptericin in day-5 and day-15
  adult heads of (i) wild-type (+/+), (ii) ∆VAP; Repo>+; gVAPP58S, (iii) ∆VAP; Repo>casparWT;
  gVAPP58S, (iv) ∆VAP; Repo>casparAAA; gVAPP58S and (v) ∆VAP; Repo>caspaΔFFAT; gVAPP58S
  lines. The data suggest that FFAT-like mutants of Caspar do not interact with VAP
  and can yet suppress age-dependent inflammation. Values on the Y-axis depict the
  fold-change normalized to the housekeeping gene rp49. Values shown are mean ± SEM.
  N = 3, n = 3. Statistical analysis by two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple
  comparison test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. (C) Caspar expresses natively
  in S2 cells. Affinity pull-down of VAPBWT and VAPBP58S, from independent stable
  S2R+ lines expressing VAPBWT:GFP and VAPBP58S:GFP, with the anti-Caspar antibody
  indicates that Caspar:VAP interaction is either at par or weaker when VAPBP58S aggregates
  are present in the cell. Protein bands that represent Caspar or VAP have been marked
  with a ‘*’, whereas nonspecific bands are marked a ‘+’ sign. (D) VAPP58Sdisease
  model depicting the players VAP, Caspar and TER94 in glial cells and their connectivity
  with IMD/Rel signalling, which regulates inflammation. The key features of the model
  include (i) ER stress caused directly or indirectly by VAP misfolding and (ii) a
  predicted upregulation of the protein degradation machinery in response to ER stress.
  VAP may act as a docking station, interacting with Caspar and TER94 to assist in
  proteasomal clearance. The AAA-ATPase TER94, itself an ALS locus, may play an important
  role for this function. The clearance of VAP aggregates in the brain is not dependent
  on Caspar function in the glia, hence the ‘?’ on the ERAD pathway. (iii) Age-dependent
  Inflammation, caused by misregulation of Rel signalling. Our data show that Caspar
  functions as a negative regulator for Rel signalling in glia (√), and this function
  is attenuated in the disease. Mechanistically, this may be a consequence of a differential
  partitioning of the available glial Caspar pool for VAP or TER94-related functions.
  As the adult animal ages, a tipping point is reached when the increasing burden
  of ER stress, proteasomal overload and glial inflammation leads to motor neuron
  cell death, subsequently followed by the death of the organism. The VAP:Caspar interaction
  itself (↔), via the Caspar FFAT motif appears not to be required (?) for Caspar
  to regulate glial inflammation. Double-headed arrows indicate interactions between
  proteins, whereas single headed arrows (→) indicate key cellular pathways.
