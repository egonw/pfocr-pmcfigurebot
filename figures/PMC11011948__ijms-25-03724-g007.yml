caption: Fisetin reduced ROS in the DVT mouse model. (a) Representative Western blots
  for NOX2 and SOD2 protein expressions in thrombi tissue extracts (n = 3). (b,c)
  The quantification of NOX2 and SOD2 protein Western blots (n = 3). (d) Representative
  images of dihydroethidium (DHE) staining of thrombi. Scale bar, 250 μm (n = 4).
  The ROS production in the thrombus was quantified and presented as the mean fluorescence
  intensity. All data are presented as means ± SD. * p < 0.05.
