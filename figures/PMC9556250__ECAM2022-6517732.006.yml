caption: SK inhibits SKOV3 and A2780 cells viability and promotes apoptosis via the
  GPER mediated pathway. (a) Cell viability of SKOV3 cells treated with 8.6 μM SK
  and 10 nM G1 or 20 nM G15 for 24 h. (b) Representative dot‑plots from cytometrically
  illustrating apoptotic status in SKOV3 cells treated with 8.6 μM SK and 10 nM G1
  or 20 nM G15 for 24 h. (c) Statistical analysis of apoptotic (percentage of cells
  in Q2 and Q3) SKOV3 cells. (d) The expression and quantitatively analysis of Bax
  and Bcl-2 proteins in SKOV3 cells treated with 8.6 μM SK and 10 nM G1 or 20 nM G15
  for 24 h. (e) Cell viability of A2780 cells treated with 0.56 μM SK and 10 nM G1
  or 20 nM G15 for 24 h. (f) Representative dot‑plots from cytometrically illustrating
  apoptotic status in A2780 cells treated with 0.56 μM SK and 10 nM G1 or 20 nM G15
  for 24 h. (g) Statistical analysis of apoptotic (percentage of cells in Q2 and Q3)
  A2780 cells. (h) The expression and quantitative analysis of Bax and Bcl-2 proteins
  in A2780 cells treated with 0.56 μM SK and 10 nM G1 or 20 nM G15 for 24 h. The results
  are means of three independent replicates ± S.D. ∗∗P < 0.01 or ∗P < 0.05 vs. control
  group, △△P < 0.01 or △P < 0.05 vs. SK treating group were considered as statistically
  significant.
