caption: SV promotes MHC II expression in DCs through activation of the autophagy
  pathway. (A) Flow cytometric analysis of MHC II expression in DCs in the PLNs after
  s.c. immunization with OVA-BPBBT-Lipo150 for 24 h. In the SV treated group, the
  mice received s.c. injection with 20 μg of SV at 24 h prior to the immunization
  (n = 3). (B, C) Immunoblotting assays of LC3A/B levels in DC2.4 cells following
  various treatments. For the 3-MA treated groups, the cells were incubated with 3-MA
  (10 mmol/L) for 1.5 h before the treatment with SV and/or OVA-BPBBT-Lipo150. (D)
  Immunoblotting assays of the protein levels of LC3A/B and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
  in DC2.4 cells with different treatments, respectively. (E) Schematic illustration
  of the autophagy activated by SV through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. (F) Immunofluorescence
  micrographs of OVA-FITC (green) and LC3 (red) in the OVA-FITC-BPBBT-Lipo150-loaded
  DC2.4 cells pretreated with or without SV for 24 h, scale bar = 10 μm. (G) Quantification
  of the co-localization in (F) (n = 20). (H) Immunofluorescence micrographs of MHC
  II (green) and LC3 (red) in the OVA-FITC-BPBBT-Lipo150-loaded DC2.4 cells pretreated
  with or without SV for 24 h, scale bar = 10 μm. (I) Quantification of the co-localization
  in (H) (n = 20). (J) TEM of MHC II in the electron-dense multivesicular compartments
  in DC2.4 cells with SV plus OVA-BPBBT-Lipo150. The cells pretreated with SV for
  24 h were fixed and cut into ultrathin sections (80 nm thickness). The sections
  were immunostained with a rabbit anti-MHC II antibody followed by a 10-nm gold-labeled
  goat anti-rabbit IgG (left). The other sections without immunogold staining were
  used as control (right). Arrows, autophagosomes, scale bar = 100 nm. Data are expressed
  as mean ± SD. ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001 vs. indicated.
