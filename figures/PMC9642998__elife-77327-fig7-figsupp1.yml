figure_title: RNA sequencing identifies transcriptome changes in the Dnajb6+/- mice
  atrium
caption: (A) Principal component analysis (PCA) reveals the variance in transcriptome
  distribution in the Dnajb6+/- mice and WT controls at 6 months. Each point represents
  the projections of individual hearts onto principal component (PC). (B) Heatmap
  of genes differentially expressed in the Dnajb6+/- mice and WT controls. Each column
  represents an individual replicate and there are 3 replicates per group. Each row
  represents an individual gene. The color bar represents relative expression of log-transformed,
  normalized counts with upregulated genes shown in red and downregulated genes in
  blue. (C) Volcano plot shows magnitude and significance of genes that altered in
  distribution in the Dnajb6+/- mice and WT controls. Genes that significantly downregulated
  in the Dnajb6+/- mice are plotted in blue (left) and upregulated are plotted in
  red (right). (D) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of differentially expressed genes
  in the Dnajb6+/- mice and WT controls. Signaling pathways are organized in the order
  of significance as –log10 of P value.
