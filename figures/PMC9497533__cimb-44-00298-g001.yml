caption: 'Inhibitory effect of evodiamine on the cell viability of gastric cancer
  cell lines. (A) Chemical structure of evodiamine. (B) Gastric cancer cells, AGS
  and MKN45, were treated with the indicated doses of evodiamine (0, 1, 5, and 10
  μM) for 24 h and cell viability was measured by WST assay. Data were from three
  independent experiments and analyzed by unpaired Student’s t-tests (** p < 0.01
  and *** p < 0.001). (C) The images were captured using an inverted microscope (×400).
  (D) Clonogenic growth inhibition by evodiamine was evaluated by clonogenic assay
  and representative images of cells stained with crystal violet are shown. Colonies
  containing >50 normal-appearing cells were counted visually, and the percentage
  inhibition of colony formation is illustrated as a graph. Data were from three independent
  experiments and analyzed by unpaired Student’s t-tests. ** p < 0.01 and *** p <
  0.001 vs. the non-treated control in AGS cells; ## p < 0.01 and ### p < 0.001 vs.
  the non-treated control in MKN45 cells.'
