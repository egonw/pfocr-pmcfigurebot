caption: Expression analysis of TAC1 and tiller-angle-related genes between NPB and
  the TAC1-OENPB-1 line at DAS50 (tillering stage) under natural long-day conditions.
  (a) Expression analysis of TAC1 and tiller-angle-related genes. (b) Expression analysis
  of tiller-angle-related genes involved in the core regulatory pathway mediated by
  LA1-dependent asymmetric distribution of auxin. All data are shown as mean ± SD
  (n = 3). Two-tail Student’s t-test was used for statistical analysis (** p < 0.01).
