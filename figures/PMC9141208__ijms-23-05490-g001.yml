caption: 'Pyruvate upregulated FGF21 expression and secretion in HepG2 cells. (A):
  pyruvate dose-dependently stimulated FGF21 gene expression after 12 h treatment
  in HepG2 cells (** p < 0.01 vs. control, n = 3). (B): FGF21 protein levels in cell
  medium significantly increased after pyruvate treatment (** p < 0.01 vs. control,
  n = 10). (C): The cell viability was not influenced by pyruvate treatment, as shown
  by MTT assay (n = 10). (D): D-LDH levels in cell medium were not changed by pyruvate
  treatment (n = 10).'
