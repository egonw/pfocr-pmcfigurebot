  The heatmap of functional gene abundance (p < 0.05) (a), the co-occurrence network
  of functional genes and carbohydrate metabolism pathways (the orange nodes represent
  functional genes, the blue nodes represent carbohydrate metabolism pathways, and
  the thickness of the lines represents the correlation strength) (p < 0.05) (ko00620:
  Pyruvate metabolism; ko00630: Glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism; ko00030:
  Pentose phosphate pathway; ko00010: Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis; ko00052: Galactose
  metabolism; ko00051: Fructose and mannose metabolism; ko00640: Propanoate metabolism;
