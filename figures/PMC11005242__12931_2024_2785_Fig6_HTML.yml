caption: GLUT3 reduction down-regulated the NF-kB/ZEB1 pathway in CSE-treated BEAS-2B
  cells (A-C) The time-dependent expression of p65 and ZEB1 after treating BEAS-2B
  cells with 5% CSE for 48 h by western blot. (D-F) Before 5% CSE treatment, BEAS-2B
  cells were transfected with NC or GLUT3 siRNA. Western blot detected p65 and ZEB1
  in BEAS-2B cells before and after transfection. (G-H) Western blot detected the
  expression of ZEB-1, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and Vimentin. The data is average ± standard
  deviation (n = 3)* P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01
