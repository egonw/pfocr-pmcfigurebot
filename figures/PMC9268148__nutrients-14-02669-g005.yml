caption: HCA inhibits K562 cells’ growth in vitro and in vivo. (A) CML cell lines
  (K562, MEG-01, CML-T1, KYO-1, and SHK-1) were incubated with different concentrations
  of HCA. After 72 h, cell viability was measured and response curves were plotted
  using GraphPad Prism 9. (B) List of IC50 values in mM calculated from curve ‘A’.
  (C–E) NSG mice were subcutaneously injected at the right flank with 0.5 × 106 K562
  cells and were divided randomly into control and HCA-treated group. HCA was administered
  daily by oral gavage at 3 mg/kg body weight. (C) Plot showing tumor volume with
  time. HCA-treated mice showed a significant delay in the tumor growth (* p < 0.05;
  ** p < 0.01; **** p < 0.0001; unpaired t-test). (D) Image of tumor from control
  and HCA-treated mice at the time of sacrifice. (E) Comparison of tumor volume of
  control (n = 7) and HCA-treated mice (n = 8) (p < 0.0001; unpaired t-test). (F)
  Comparison of tumor weight of control (n = 7) and HCA-treated mice (n = 8) (p <
  0.0001; unpaired t-test).
