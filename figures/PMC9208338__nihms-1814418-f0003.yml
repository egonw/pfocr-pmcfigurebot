caption: Signaling pathway inhibitors alter ferroptosis. (A and B) 451Lu (A) and MeWo
  (B) cells were treated as indicated for 24 h and analyzed for viability. Means and
  SD are shown (n = 4, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01). (C and D) 451Lu cells were treated
  as indicated for 24 h and analyzed for the relative abundance of GSH/GSSG (C), NADPH/NADP+
  (C), and MDA level (D). Means and SD are shown (n = 4, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01).
