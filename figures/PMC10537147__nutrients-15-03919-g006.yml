caption: The IκBα/NF-κB pathway is a target of the ROR–NOB axis. (A) Protein expressions
  of IκBα and phosphorylation of p65 in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells treated with NOB
  20 µM at 6 days after differentiation. The right panel represents the quantification
  result. Two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s (for IκBα) or Tukey’s (p-p65) multiple comparison
  test (*, p < 0.05; ****, p < 0.0001). (B) Real-time qPCR analysis of lipogenesis-related
  gene expressions at 6 days after differentiation. Data are shown as mean ± SEM every
  4 h for 24 h (n = 3/group/time point). (C) TNFα level from media using ELISA. Data
  are shown as mean ± SEM. Two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test (***,
  p < 0.001; ****, p < 0.0001).
