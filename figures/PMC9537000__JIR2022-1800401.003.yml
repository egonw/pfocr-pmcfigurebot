caption: Effect of the conciliatory anti-allergic decoction on inflammatory cells
  in asthmatic mice induced by RSV. The cell numbers of total cells (a), neutrophils
  (b), eosinophils (c), and lymphocytes (d) in BALF of mice in the MC group were significantly
  increased, while that in the CAD-treated groups were significantly decreased. ∗∗P < 0.01,
  compared with the MC group.
