caption: E2F2 regulates key signaling pathways and oncogenic signatures. (A) Heatmap
  of the differentially expressed genes regulated by E2F2. The stable E2F2 knockdown
  A549 cells were collected and subjected to RNA-seq analysis. (B-C) GO and KEGG pathway
  enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes. (D) Top enriched gene
  sets by GSEA analysis. False discovery rate, FDR. (E-G) GSEA plots of the top enriched
  gene sets. (H) Verification of important E2F2-regulated downstream genes by qRT-PCR
  in E2F2 knockdown cells. (I) E2F2 is essential for activation of PI3K-AKT pathway.
  Immunoblotting was conducted to determine total and phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) levels
  in the stable E2F2 overexpression and knockdown A549 cells.
