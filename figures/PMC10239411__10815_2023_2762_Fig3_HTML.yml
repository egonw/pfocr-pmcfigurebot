caption: Spatiotemporal expression of INHBB in the endometrium and HESCs. a Expression
  of INHBB in the endometrium. Scale bar = 100 μm. S, stroma; GE, glandular epithelium.
  b Quantifying IHC results from the stromal compartment of the endometrium (n = 6
  for each group). **P < 0.05, *P < 0.05, using one-way ANOVA. c RT-qPCR was performed
  to assay the expression of INHBB during physiological cycles (n = 9 for the Proliferative
  phase and Decidua groups, and n = 8 for the Secretory phase group). *P < 0.05, using
  one-way ANOVA. d The expression pattern of INHBB in HESCs treated with 0.5 mM 8-Br-cAMP
  and 1 μM MPA for different periods (0, 24, 48, or 72 h) was evaluated by RT-qPCR,
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 (n = 3, one-way ANOVA). e Western blot analysis
  was used to examine the protein levels of INHBB in HESCs treated with 0.5 mM 8-Br-cAMP
  and 1 μM MPA for different periods (0, 24, 48, or 72 h)
