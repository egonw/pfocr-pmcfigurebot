caption: LrB suppressed angiotensin (Ang) II-induced activation of TGF-β1/Smad signaling
  pathway in cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) via regulating PAI-1. (a) Representative fluorescent
  images of fibroblast-specific protein-1 (FSP1) and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)
  in CFs. Scar bar = 50 μm. (b) Western blot analysis for PAI-1 in CFs transfected
  with empty vector or PAI-1 overexpression (OE) vector. (c, d) Relative mRNA and
  protein expression of PAI-1 in CFs. (e) Western blot analysis for TGF-β1R, TGF-β1,
  p-Smad2/3, and Smad2/3. Relative protein expression of (f) TGF-β1R, (g) TGF-β1,
  (h) p-Smad2/3, and (i) Smad2/3 in CFs. Values are indicated as mean ± SD (n = 3).
