caption: Transbronchial lung biopsy specimen revealed fragments of lung parenchyma
  characterized by subacute and fibrosing interstitial lung damage associated with
  chronic hemorrhagic lung injury (small arrow). Low and high-power magnifications
  demonstrated an interstitial and endovascular infiltration (large arrow) of epithelioid
  shaped cells, respectively, ((a,b) hematoxylin-eosin X2 and X13). The epithelioid
  cells resulted negative (c) for pancytokeratin (clone AE1-3 X13), and were strongly
  immunoreactive (d) for CD31 (X 12,5). Pulmonary hemangioendothelioma (PEH) was diagnosed;
  the patient was referred to a specialized Oncology Unit but died 10 months later.
  In almost all PEHs, a characteristic t(1;3) (p36; q23â€“25) translocation leading
  to a WWTR1-CAMTA1 fusion can be demonstrated []. Where a single, resectable pulmonary
  nodule is detected, a surgical approach could be an effective therapeutic option,
  whereas chemotherapy might be adopted in cases of multiple unresectable lung lesions
  []. Most of the previously published reports were diagnosed using open-lung or thoracoscopic
  specimens with confirmatory immunohistochemical stains of irregularly epithelioid-shaped
  cells, which were immunoreactive for CD31, ERG, and FLi-1 and negative for CD34,
  pancytokeratins, CK7, p63, chromogranin, synaptophysin, MUM1/IRF4, and TTF-1 [],
  but a diagnosis has also been obtained by transbronchial samples []. Owing to the
  low incidence of PEH, there are no definite treatment guidelines. In fact, there
  is no single effective treatment, though spontaneous regression and a response to
  chemotherapy and interferon have been reported []. In conclusion, this case indicates
  the difficulty in diagnosing this rare tumor based only on the clinical-radiological
  picture, with HRCT differential diagnosis including diffuse interstitial lung diseases,
  lung cancer with endovascular spreading, vascular tumors, and granulomatous infections.
  Although a transbronchial biopsy showed a chronic hemorrhagic lung injury, this
  was only the epiphenomenon either of the radiological pattern or of the interstitial,
  endovascular infiltrating pathway of the epithelioid vascular tumor cells. Pancytokeratin
  and common leukocyte antigen (CD45) negativity ruled out either the carcinoma or
  lymphoma hypotheses, whereas a strong immunoreactivity for vascular markers (CD31
  and FLi-1) confirmed the diagnosis of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. Clinicians
  should always consider bronchoscopy as a useful and effective tool to better investigate
  indeterminate and questionable clinical pictures, thereby sparing patients the morbidity
  and mortality associated with more invasive techniques such as surgical or thoracoscopic
  biopsy.
