caption: 'Jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis genes are upregulated, either transiently
  or for at least 4 weeks, in Norway spruce bark in response to methyl jasmonate (MeJA)
  treatment. Expression profiles of genes displaying a significantly (adjusted p < 0.001)
  altered expression pattern across time as a result of MeJA treatment and which were
  annotated as encoding for enzymes (yellow boxes) involved in the (+)−7‐iso‐JA‐Ile
  biosynthesis pathway. In the plots, faint lines indicate the mean expression profiles,
  with 95% confidence intervals, of individual transcripts and the thicker lines depict
  the mean per enzyme category profile, for water controls (blue) and MeJA treatments
  (red). Read counts were normalised using the variance stabilising transformation
  (vst) in DEseq. 2. The JA biosynthesis pathway is based on knowledge from angiosperms
  such as Arabidopsis thaliana and Solanum lycopersicum and was adapted from Wasternack
  and Hause () and Wasternack and Song (). Compound abbreviations: α‐LeA, α‐linolenic
  acid; 13‐HPOT, (13S)‐hydroperoxyoctadecatrienoic acid; cis‐(+)‐OPDA, cis‐(+)−12‐oxophytodienoic
  acid; OPC‐8, 3‐oxo‐2‐(2‐pentenyl)‐cyclopentane‐1‐octanoic acid; (+)−7‐iso‐JA, (+)−7‐iso‐jasmonic
  acid; (+)−7‐iso‐JA‐Ile, (+)−7‐iso‐jasmonoyl‐l‐isoleucine. Enzyme abbreviations:
  13S‐LOX, 13S‐lipoxygen‐ase; AOC, allene oxide cyclase; AOS, allene oxide synthase;
  JAR1, JA‐amino acid synthetase; OPR, OPDA reductase; PLA1, phospholipase A1. [Color
