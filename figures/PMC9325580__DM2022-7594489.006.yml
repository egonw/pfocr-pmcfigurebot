caption: COPS3 depletion suppressed tumor growth in vivo. (a) The representative images
  of tumors in control and COPS2 siRNA transfection mice and the tumor growth curve.
  (b) IHC assays showed the expression of COPS2 in tumors in control and COPS2 siRNA
  transfection mice. (c) Immunoblot showed the expression of COPS2, E-cadherin, Erk,
  p-Erk, Mek, and p-Mek in tumors from control and COPS2 siRNA transfection mice.
  Data are presented as mean ± SD. ∗∗∗p < 0.001, siCOPS3 vs. siControl.
