caption: Effects of MOP on the gut microbiota of broilers. (A) The Venn diagram analysis
  of OTUs. (B) PCoA is based on the unweightedâˆ’UniFrac distance matrix of OTUs. (C)
  Chao1 diversity; observed_species; Simpson; Shannon diversity. (D) Relative abundance
  of gut microbiota composition at the level of phylum. (E) Relative abundance of
  gut microbiota composition at the level of genus. (F) LDA scores show the significant
  bacterial differences in the (log LDA > 3.0; n = 4 chickens/group). (G). The Venn
  diagram for LEfSe and the abundance of the top 20 bacterial taxa at the genus level.
  (H) Correlation analysis of tibia-related parameters, bone metabolism-related parameters,
  oxidative stress and BMP/Smads signaling pathway with gut microbiota. Bars with
  no common small letters (a, b) indicate statistical differences among the three
  groups (p < 0.05). ns showed no statistical significance among the three treatment
  groups (p > 0.05).
