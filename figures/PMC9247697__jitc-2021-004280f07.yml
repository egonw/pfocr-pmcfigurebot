caption: 'cGAS/STING pathway signaling and immune-dependent control of PARP1KO cells.
  (A, B) Levels of cGAMP in LLC (A) and TC1 (B) clones, cultured for 24 hours in normal
  culture medium. Mean±SEM Ten replicates per group except in LLC PARP1KO group (n=9–10
  replicates). Data are shown as area of the metabolite peak. A.U: arbitrary unit.
  P values were calculated using the Student’s t-test. (C, D) IFNA1 and IFNB1 expression
  was assessed in PARhigh and PARP1KO LLC (C) and TC1 (D) cells by quantitative PCR
  using specific fluorescently labeled primer-probes sets. GAPDH was used as house-keeping
  gene. Fold changes of three independent experiments. Means±SEM. P values were calculated
  using the Student’s t-test. (E) PARPKOSTINGWT TC1 parental cells and their PARP1KOSTINGKO
  derivatives (PS4 and PS6 clones) were cultured in normal culture medium and processed
  for the immunoblotting-based assessment of PAR-containing proteins and STING expression.
  Actin levels were monitored to ensure equal loading of lanes. (F) PARhighSTINGWT,
  PARP1KOSTINGWT and PARP1KOSTINGKO TC1 cells were implanted subcutaneously into C57BL/6
  mice (n=10 mice per group). Tumor growth was routinely monitored with a standard
  caliper and is reported as means±SEM. P values were calculated as compared with
  PARhighSTINGWT group (Wald test, type 2 ANOVA). Tumor growth is reported as means±SEM.
  ANOVA, analysis of variance; LLC, Lewis lung cancer; PAR, poly(ADP-ribose).'
