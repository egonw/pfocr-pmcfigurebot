figure_title: YAP signaling is a potent driver of the onset and progression of chondrosarcoma
caption: A Volcano plot of transcriptome profiles between human chondrosarcoma cell
  lines and controls from GSE48420. B KEGG analysis of the chondrosarcoma RNA-seq
  data showing the top 20 enriched pathways. Red box directs to Hippo pathway. C IHC
  analysis of the expression of YAP in human normal cartilage (control) and chondrosarcoma
  (hCHS) samples. Quantitative analysis was at right by Image J software. N = 12.
  D YAP expression in chondrosarcoma tissues (mCHS) from Col2-Cre;Trp53f/f/Rb1f/f
  mice compared to adjacent normal cartilage (control). E Schematic presentation of
  primary chondrosarcoma cells from Col2-Cre;Trp53f/f/Rb1f/f mice. F Representative
  images of immunofluorescent staining of YAP in primary chondrosarcoma cells. Scale
  bars, 50 μm. G The primary chondrosarcoma cells from Col2-Cre;Trp53f/f/Rb1f/f mice
  or primary chondrocytes from Col2-Cre mice were co-transfected with a luciferase
  reporter and pRL-TK plasmids (internal control) as indicated, respectively. After
  transfection of 48 h, the luciferase activities were identified by the Dual-Luciferase
  Assay Kit. H Soft agar analysis after silence of YAP using two different YAP lentivirus
  in primary chondrosarcoma cells from Col2-Cre;Trp53f/f/Rb1f/f mice as indicated.
  The corresponding quantification is identified on the right. N = 3. I–K The analyses
  of migration (I), invasion (J), and tumorsphere (K) after silence of YAP in primary
  chondrosarcoma cells as above. The corresponding quantification is identified on
  the right. N = 3. Error bars were the means ± SEM from three independent experiments.
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
