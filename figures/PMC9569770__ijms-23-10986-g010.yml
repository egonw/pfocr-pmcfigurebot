caption: Effect of Spd-AG and H2O2 on the expression level of polyamines enzymatic
  pathway. C2C12 were treated with Spd 10μM in combination with AG 1 mM and/or H2O2
  0.3 mM for 6 h and RNA transcript expression of the polyamine enzymatic pathway
  was evaluated. qRT-PCR of biosynthetic enzymes (A) ornithine decarboxylase (ODC),
  spermidine synthase (SDS), spermine synthase (SMS), or catabolic enzymes (B) spermine
  oxidase (SMOX), spermine-/spermidine-N1-acetyltransferase 1 (SAT1) and polyamine
  oxidase (PAOX) amplified from C2C12 myoblasts were assayed. Data are calculated
  relative to the internal housekeeping gene (GAPDH) and are expressed as the mean
  fold change compared with control. Each value represents the mean ± SEM of three
  independent experiments, each performed in triplicate. One-way ANOVA followed by
  Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test was performed * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01.
