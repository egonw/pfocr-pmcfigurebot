caption: Increased cell surface expression of VEGFR-2 and NP-1 receptors in Erlotinib-resistant
  NSCLC cell lines. For the analysis, 5 Ã— 105 H2170-P/ER, H358-P/ER, H1975, and H3255
  cells were seeded in a Petri dish and allowed to grow and adhere for 48 h. After
  the growth medium was removed, the cells were washed and detached. Cells were then
  collected, pelleted, re-suspended in a buffer, pelleted again, probed with antibody,
  washed, and re-suspended in buffer before being used for flow cytometry. Cell surface
  expression was compared in (A) H2170-ER cells compared to H2170-P cells, (B) H358-ER
  cells compared to parental cells, and (C) T790M- and L858R-mutant H1975 cells compared
  to L858R-mutant H3255 cells. Statistical analyses were performed, and it was demonstrated
  that the results were statistically significant (p < 0.05) by m of two-tailed t-test
  analyses. One asterisk (*) denotes the statistical significance of data concerning
  NP-1, whereas two asterisks (**) denote the statistical significance of data concerning
  VEGFR-2.
