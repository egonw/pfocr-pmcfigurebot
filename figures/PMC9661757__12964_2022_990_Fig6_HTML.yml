caption: JAK1 knockdown elevates the expression of HIF downstream genes in KLE cells.
  A RT-qPCR measurement of the mRNA expression of HIF downstream genes in parental
  and JAK1-knockdown KLE cells. The cells were incubated under hypoxia (2% O2). After hypoxia
  for 0, 2 h, 4 h, cells were harvested, respectively. Data are shown as the mean ± SD
  (n = 3). B RT-qPCR measurement of the mRNA expression of HIF downstream genes in
  different KLE cells. The cells were treated with DMSO or Ruxolitinib (1 μmol) for
  48 h. Then cells were incubated under hypoxia (2% O2). After hypoxia for 0, 2 h,
  4 h, cells were harvested, respectively. Data are shown as the mean ± SD (n = 3)
