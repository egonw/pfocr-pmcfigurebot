caption: An overview of DRPreter. In the graph representation sections, embeddings
  of pathway subgraphs and drug molecule were obtained using GNN. With the obtained
  pathway embeddings and drug embeddings as inputs to the transformer-based cell-line
  and drug fusion module, the embeddings were updated by reflecting inter-pathway
  relationships and pathway-drug relationships in the model learning process.
