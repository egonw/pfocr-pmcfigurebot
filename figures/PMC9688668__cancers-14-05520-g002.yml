caption: 'The mTOR pathway. mTORC1, also known as the rapamycin-sensitive complex,
  is made up of four proteins: mTOR, raptor, mLST8, and PRAS40. TSC1/2-Rheb is mTORC1’s
  primary upstream regulator. mTORC1 regulates protein translation by phosphorylating
  S6K1 and 4EBP1 via the TSC1/2-Rheb axis, which integrates cellular energy levels,
  growth hormones, and Wnt signals. Rheb, TSC1/2, AMPK, Rag, and Akt are the key upstream
  regulators of mTORC1. When mTORC1 is active at the lysosome membrane, it phosphorylates
  4E-BP1, S6K, SREBP, and some autophagy components, all of which influence protein
  synthesis, lipid and lysosome production, energy metabolism, and autophagy. On the
  other hand, little is known about mTORC2’s upstream regulators.'
