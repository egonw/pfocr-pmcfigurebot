caption: Effects of LHX2 deletion sequence on reporter gene expression. (A) Phylogenetic
  tree of 13 primates and ungulates for the detection of the 582-bp deleted sequence.
  (B) Regulatory elements, epigenomic signals, and conservation scores on selective
  sweep region in chromosome 11. The black box represents the deletion variant location
  of LHX2. (C) The expression of LHX2, CRB2, and DENND1A in different stages of prenatal
  skin in cashmere goats. Boxes of different colors are used to represent genes. The
  expression data have been downloaded from a previous report []. (D) A dual-luciferase
  assay using NIH3T3 cell and 293T cell shows the LHX2 upstream deletion sequence
  blocks the activity of luciferase. Data are shown as the mean Â± standard error.
  The Pvalue was calculated using the Student ttest. (E) The molecular mechanisms
  of cashmere fiber development. In detail, the deletion of the LHX2 insulator increases
  the expression of LHX2 and promotes the cashmere fiber growth at the anagen stage,
  and AR could participate in hair growth at the anagen stage through the IGF1 pathway
  [], while the deletion of the 504-bp enhancer reduces the expression of FGF5, thereby
  inhibiting growth regression; JAK2 and EDA2R may also participate in this stage
  via the JAK/STAT and Wnt pathways, respectively.
