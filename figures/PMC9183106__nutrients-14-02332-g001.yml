caption: 'The influence of NOB intervention during pregnancy on the weight of the
  maternal rats, placenta, and fetus in RUPP-induced SD rats. (A) Chemical structure
  of Nobiletin (5,6,7,8,3,4-hexamethoxyflavone, NOB). (B) Body weight and organ coefficient
  of the pregnant rats. (C) Representative pictures of the placenta and fetus. (D)
  The implantation sites per litter, placental weight, fetus weight, and placental
  efficiency (fetal/placental weight ratio). Data are expressed as the mean ± standard
  error (Mean ± SEM). a: comparing with the control groups, p < 0.05; b: comparing
  with the NOB groups, p < 0.05.'
