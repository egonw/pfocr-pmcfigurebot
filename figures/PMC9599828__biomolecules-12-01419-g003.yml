caption: Pathway analysis. (a) Triple Venn diagram illustrating the number of pathways
  significantly changed in acute HFpEF vs. HCM, chronic HFpEF vs. HCM and acute HFpEF
  vs. chronic HFpEF. (b) Representation of all significantly altered pathways between
  the three comparison groups in order of significance (x-axis is âˆ’log10(FDR)); and
  (c) for the pathway of platelet degranulation in response to elevated platelet cytosolic
  Ca2+. IGF, insulin-like growth factor; and IGFBP, insulin-like growth factor binding
  protein.
