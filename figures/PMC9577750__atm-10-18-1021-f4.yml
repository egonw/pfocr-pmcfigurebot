caption: Analysis of the tumor immune microenvironment. (A) The differences in stromal
  score, immune score, and ESTIMATE score between the 2 clusters. (B) The differences
  in the scores of 10 kinds of immune cells between the 2 clusters. (C) The expression
  levels of immune checkpoint genes between the 2 clusters. (D-G) Score differences
  of the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity,
  antigen processing and presentation, and the B cell receptor signaling pathway between
  the 2 clusters. (H) CYT score differences between the 2 clusters. *P<0.05; **P<0.01;
  ***P<0.001; ****P<0.0001. ns, no significance; ESTIMATE, Estimation of Stromal and
  Immune cells in Malignant Tumors using Expression data; NK, natural killer; CYT,
  cytolytic activity.
