caption: Eplerenone co-administration with Carfilzomib prevented increase in blood
  pressure and Lcn2, urine retention, and histological deficits in vivo. Graphs of
  (A) serum creatinine (mg/dL) and (B) serum urea-bound-nitrogen (BUN) (mg/dL) (n
  = 6 per group) and (C) % LLVY chymotrypsin-like activity expressed as Fold change
  of control in the kidneys and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs, n = 6 per
  group). (D) Graphs of metabolic parameters assessed in the metabolic cages after
  24 h namely urine volume (mL)/body weight(g), feces weight/body weight, food uptake/body
  weight and water intake (mL)/body weight(g) (n = 6 per group). (E) Representative
  hematoxylin-eosin histology images of kidney tissue and (F) relative mRNA expression
  of Lcn2 and Kim-1 expressed as fold change of controls (n = 6 per group). (G) Graph
  of glomerular volume (Vglom/field area) (20×, bar corresponds to 20 μm) (n = 5 per
  group). One-way ANOVA, Tukey’s post hoc test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
