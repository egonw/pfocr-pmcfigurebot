caption: PA inhibits NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways (A) The representative western
  blot of NF-κB and MAPK pathway proteins after receiving 5 ​ng/ml IL-1β stimulation
  for different durations (0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 ​min), and (B) its quantification
  (C) The representative western blot of NF-κB pathway proteins after receiving 5 ​ng/ml
  IL-1β for 15 ​min and 20 ​μM ​PA alone or in combination for 48 ​h, and (D) its
  quantification (E) IF analysis of p-P65 and its (F) fluorescence intensity quantification
  (G) The representative western blot of MAPK pathway proteins after receiving 5 ​ng/ml
  IL-1β for 15 ​min and 20 ​μM ​PA alone or in combination for 48 ​h, and (H) its
  quantification.
