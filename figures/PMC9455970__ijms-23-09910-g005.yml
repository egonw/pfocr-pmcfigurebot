caption: AKT and ERK phosphorylation/activation in vemurafenib treated and resistant
  melanoma cell lines. (A) The activity of signaling pathways in parental lines (CTRL)
  after short-term 24 h treatment with vemurafenib (1, 2, and 5 μM) or DMSO, and in
  cell lines resistant to vemurafenib (R1 and R2) is analyzed by western blot. β-actin
  was used as a loading control. (B) Densitometric analysis of pAKT/AKT signals from
  two biological replicates shows activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in vemurafenib-resistant
  primary melanoma cell line (WM793B-R).
