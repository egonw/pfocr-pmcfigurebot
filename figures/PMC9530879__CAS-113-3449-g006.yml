caption: Quantitative plate‐based assays and mitochondrial stress test of patient‐specific
  induced pluripotent stem cell‐derived cardiomyocytes (pt‐iPSC‐CMs) following trastuzumab
  (Tmab) or doxorubicin (DOX) treatment. (A–C) Relative change in each assay with
  drug treatment. (A) Quantification of ATP content measured using Cell Titer‐Glo
  assay. (B) Quantification of reative oxygen species (ROS) generation measured using
  ROS‐Glo H2O2 assay. (C) Autophagy level measured using CYTO‐ID staining. (D) Representative
  images of immunostaining of CYTO‐ID green. (E) Quantification of cardiac troponin
  I in the culture medium with ELISA. (F) Amplitudes of peak Ca2+ transients. (G,
  H) Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured using the Seahorse XF24 extracellular‐flux
  analyzer. (G) Representative plot of OCR measured following drug treatment. Each
  evaluation parameter and sequential addition (oligomycin, FCCP, and Rot/Ant‐A) is
  shown in the graph. (H) Maximal respiration shown with relative OCR rate. (I) Mitochondrial
  membrane potential was measured using JC‐1 dye. Data were obtained using all lines
  of pt‐iPSC‐CMs and the assay was repeated three times. NP, noncardiotoxic patient
  group; ns, not significant; SP, severely cardiotoxic patient group; FCCP, carbonyl
  cyanide 4‐(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone; Rot/Ant‐A, rotenone/antimycin A
