figure_title: Efficacy of combination treatments in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
  and colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines
caption: a, Comparison of combination scores (cScore) indicating the response of the
  KRASG12C mutant NSCLC cell line, NCI-H2122, to the combination treatment of AMG
  510 or adagrasib with 179 other small molecules for 72 hours. Positive scores indicate
  synergistic effects with scores >5–10 generally considered “clear synergy.” Empty
  or yellow/blue coloured circles highlight selected compounds for reference. b, Comparison
  of combination scores (cScore) indicating the response of KRASG12C mutant CRC cell
  line, SW837, to the combination treatment of AMG 510 or adagrasib with 15 other
  small molecules for 96 hours. Positive scores indicate synergistic effects with
  scores >5–10 generally considered “clear synergy”. Empty or yellow/blue coloured
  circles highlight selected compounds for reference. c, Response of indicated cell
  line to the combination treatment of adagrasib with an SOS1 inhibitor (BI-3406),
  a SHP2 inhibitor (TNO155 or SHP099), or an EGFR inhibitor (cetuximab). Cell lines
  are indicated as colorectal cancer (CRC; orange), esophageal (light blue), or non-small
  cell lung cancer (NSCLC; dark blue). MAPK Pathway Activity Score (MPAS) are indicated.
  d, Growth kinetic of NCI-H2122 (right) or SW837 (left) cells treated with indicated
  single or combination treatments, or vehicle control (N=3 for each curve). Y-axis
  indicates change in confluency relative to t=0 hours. Inset shows boxed area for
  clarity. Mean ± SEM shown. Data analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
  with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test.
