caption: Changes in EPAS1 and miRNA-150_R-1 in blood and placental tissues and transfection
  efficiency of miRNA-150_R-1 in BEND cells. (A) EPAS1 and miR-150_R-1 mRNA expression
  levels in NC and RP blood. (B) EPAS1 and miR-150_R-1 mRNA expression levels in NC
  and RP placental tissues. (C) At 12, 24, 48, or 72 h and final mimic concentrations
  of 25, 50, or 100 nM, the transfection efficiency of the mimic was verified using
  qPCR, with mimic NC used as a control. Data represent the mean Â± SEM. *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01. NC, fetal membranes of normal discharge; RP, retained placenta.
article_title: miRNA-150_R-1 mediates the HIF-1/ErbB signaling pathway to regulate
  the adhesion of endometrial epithelial cells in cows experiencing retained placenta.
