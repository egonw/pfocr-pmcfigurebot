caption: Confirmation of the optimal concentrations of rapamycin and MHY1487 for Caco-2
  cells. (A) Effect of different concentrations of rapamycin on the viability of Caco-2
  cells. (B) Effect of different concentrations of rapamycin on the expression of
  p-mTOR in Caco-2 cells. (C) Effect of different concentrations of MHY1487 on the
  viability of Caco-2 cells. (D) Effect of different concentrations of MHY1487 on
  the expression of p-mTOR in Caco-2 cells. Optimal concentrations for rapamycin and
  MHY1487 were 10 nM and 100 nM, respectively. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ****P < 0.0001.
