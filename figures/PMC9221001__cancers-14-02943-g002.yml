caption: 'Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) summary. To investigate possible interactions
  of differently regulated genes, datasets representing 21 genes with altered expression
  profile obtained from the Illumina microarray were imported into the Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis Tool, and the following data are represented: (A) The network analysis
  of the most highly rated network (cell death, cellular development, and hematopoiesis).
  Genes shaded in red were determined to be significantly regulated from the statistical
  analysis and were validated by real-time PCR. A solid line represents a direct interaction
  between the two gene products and a dotted line means there is an indirect interaction.
  (B) Pathway analysis. The top canonical pathways with p-values ranging from 1.01
  × 10−2 to 3.26 × 10−2 are represented. (C) Biofunction annotations. The x-axis represents
  the top biological functions as calculated by IPA based on differentially expressed
  genes, and the y-axis represents the ratio of number of genes from the dataset that
  map to the pathway and the number of all known genes ascribed to the pathway. The
  yellow line represents the threshold of p < 0.05 as calculated by Fischer’s test.'
