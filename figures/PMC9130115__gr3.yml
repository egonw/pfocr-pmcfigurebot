caption: Intrinsic signal pathways analysis. (A) Schematic diagram of L-Arg/MB@MP
  causing cell cycle arrest and inducing apoptosis via signaling pathways in vitro.
  (B) Flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle after various treatments. (C) The percentage
  of each phase on the cell cycle in different treatment groups. (D) Western blot
  analysis of key proteins of cell cycle and downstream pathway proteins in EMT-6 ​cells.
  (E) Flow cytometry-based apoptosis assay using Annexin V-FITC/PI co-staining. (F)
  The percentages of apoptotic cells were assessed by flow cytometry. (G) Western
  blot assays for detecting apoptosis-related and antiapoptotic proteins expression
  in EMT-6 ​cells treated at different conditions. (+) represented laser irradiation
  (660 ​nm, 0.5 ​W/cm2, 5 ​min). Data were shown mean ​± ​SD, n ​= ​3. ∗∗p ​< ​0.01
  and ∗∗∗p ​< ​0.005.
