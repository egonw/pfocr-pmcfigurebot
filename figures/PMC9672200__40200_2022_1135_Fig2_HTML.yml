caption: 'Primaquine protects HepG2 cells from glycation, oxidation and insulin resistance
  via K7/EGFR/Akt signaling pathway. (A-B) Quantification of K7 and p-Akt. (A) Total
  cell lysates were subjected to western blot analysis with antibodies against K7,
  p-Akt, and β-actin, as indicated. Compared to the group treated with MG only, primaquine
  enhanced the levels of K7 and p-Akt by approximately 60% upon MG pressure. *p < 0.05
  versus MG group. (B) With wild-type cells as the control, K7 expression increased
  1.7 folds post transfection with pcDNA3.1-K7 while p-Akt amount expanded by 1.5
  folds in the transfected cells. No distinction of the amount of K7 or p-Akt expression
  was observed between wild-type and the pcDNA3.1-EGFP HepG2 cells. Data are presented
  as means ± SD. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 compared to wild-type or EGFP overexpressed
  group (n ≥ 3 independent experiments). (C-F) The beneficial effects of K7 expression
  on glycation, oxidation and insulin resistance. (C) Expression of EGFP or K7 did
  not impact the cell survival rate. (D) K7 overexpression protected cells from glycative
  stress in HepG2 cells, while EGFP expression failed to show any positive effects
  on cell viability. Therefore, K7 instead of EGFP possesses the anti-glycation potency.
  (E) Expression of K7 boosted the resilience to oxidative stress in HepG2 cells,
  and the effect was not found for EGFP, proving that K7 but not EGFP holds the promise
  for treatment of diseases caused by oxidative stress. (F) Upregulated K7 reduced
  insulin resistance (IR) by speeding up glucose consumption upon insulin challenge
  while no change for glucose metabolism was reflected without the IR challenge. The
  glucose uptake was amplified by 35% in K7 cells compared with wild-type ones, while
  cells transfected with EGFP exhibited no glucose uptake increase in IR model. For
  all comparisons, data are presented as means ± SD. ###p < 0.001 versus wild-type
  normal group; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 compared to the non-treatment wild-type model
  group. (n ≥ 3 independent experiments). (G-I) K7 knockout (KO) leads to loss of
  the protection of primaquine against stresses in HepG2 cells. (G) The influence
  of primaquine on K7 KO cells with glycative stress. The cells were divided into
  three major groups: wild-type (WT) cells, Scrambled KO cells and K7 KO cells. Primaquine
  pretreatment resisted the glycative pressure in all cells except K7 KO cells. (H)
  The deletion of K7 caused the removal of anti-oxidation activity of primaquine.
  The concentration of H2O2 was 1.5 mM, which drove the cell survival to be a half
  to that of the control. Compared to WT and scrambled cells, K7 KO cells could not
  be rescued by primaquine, supporting the necessity of K7 for the activity of primaquine.
  (I) Primaquine failed to show protective effect on insulin resistance in K7 KO cells.
  Insulin resistance (IR) was induced with 30 mM glucose and 100 nM insulin. Distinct
  from WT and scrambled cells, K7 KO cells compromised the beneficial effect of primaquine
  in the model, implying that primaquine works through K7 to suppress IR. All data
  are presented as means ± SD. For each cell type, ###p < 0.001 versus normal group,
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01versus the non-treatment model group. (n ≥ 3 independent experiments).
