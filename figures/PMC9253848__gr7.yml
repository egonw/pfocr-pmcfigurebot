caption: Molecular profiles of mutational landscapes and ‘Double hits’ of subclonal
  shifts observed during progression of myelomatogenesis. (a) Depicts list of co-occurrences
  of mutations in same clones or in different clones in patients and the cytogenetic
  abnormalities, (b) Summary of drug pathway genes that may act as target genes or
  are involved in regulating drug sensitivities, (c) Cartoon showing three types of
  subclonal shifts (Co-occurring subclonal gains, Co-occurring subclonal gains with
  loss and mutually exclusive) that can be observed either within same clone or separate
  clones. The co-occurring clonal shifts (Co-occurring subclonal gains or Co-occurring
  subclonal gains with loss) act like ‘Double hits’ and when present in same clone
  may promote progression by altering multiple pathways synergistically whereas mutually
  exclusive clonal shifts tend to result in antagonist synthetic lethal interactions
  that prevent tumorigenesis. The pathways triggered by such clonal shifts could be
  explored for development of novel and risk appropriate combinatorial therapies.
