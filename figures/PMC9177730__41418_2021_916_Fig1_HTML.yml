figure_title: SARS-CoV-2 induced expression of genes enriched in the inflammasome-related
  NOD-like receptor signaling pathway in human airway epithelial cells
caption: Aâ€“E Dot plot visualization of KEGG pathway enrichment. Pathway enrichment
  analyses were performed using R package clusterProfiler. The color of the dots represents
  the adjusted p value for each enriched KEGG pathway, and the size of the dots represents
  the count of genes enriched in the corresponding pathway. F Gene set enrichment
  analysis (GSEA) enrichment plot of the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway. G Heatmap
  of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in NOD-like receptor signaling pathway.
  The included genes have the absolute values of log2 (fold change) more than 1 and
  adjusted p value less than 0.05.
