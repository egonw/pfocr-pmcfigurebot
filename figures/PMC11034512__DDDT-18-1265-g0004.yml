caption: 'Effect of OB on histopathological damages and inflammatory indicators in
  CFA mice. (A) HE staining photomicrographs of cross-section from Control, CFA, CFA
  + OB groups. Sciatic nerves of CFA group had significant axonal shrinkage (blue
  arrows), demyelination changes, as well as vacuolar-like defects (green arrows).
  Magnification, 400 ×. (B–E) We used ELISA to measure the levels of CXCL1, lL-1β,
  IL-10 and TGF-β. The data obtained are represented as the means ± SD. *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01 when compared to the control group, #P< 0.05, ##P < 0.01 when compared
  to CFA group, n = 5 per group.'
