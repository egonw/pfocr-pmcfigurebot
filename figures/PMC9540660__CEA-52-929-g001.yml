caption: Co‐expression networks of non‐birch‐allergic and birch‐allergic patients
  at baseline. (A) Co‐expression network modules were identified using WGCNA between
  unstimulated non‐birch‐allergic (unstim‐NBA) and unstimulated birch‐allergic (unstim‐BA)
  patients. Modules were linked to the estimated cell fractions determined by the
  Cibersort (CS) leukocyte deconvolution algorithm. Colour represents the correlation
  coefficient. Only correlations with a p‐value<.001 are shown. (B) Modules correlating
  with the phenotype were further analysed for pathway enrichment using ReactomePA.
  (C/D/E) Protein–Protein Interaction (PPI) networks of enriched modules were built
  with STRING database (V11.5) and visualized using Cytoscape. The CytoHubba plug‐in
  for Cytoscape was used to determine hub genes within each module, which are highlighted
  in orange. Networks were built with the top 200 genes with the highest module membership.
  Module names have been chosen according to involved genes, enriched pathways and
  hub genes. All PPI networks showed an enrichment value of p < 1 × 10−10
