caption: The relationship between PCMT1 and oncogenic pathways in cervical cancer.
  (A) GSEA showed the correlation between PCMT1 expression and HALLMARK gene sets
  in cervical cancer based on TCGA data. (B) GSEA showed the correlation between PCMT1
  expression and KEGG pathway gene sets in cervical cancer based on TCGA data. FDR,
  false discovery rate; PCMT1, protein-L-isoaspartate O-methyltransferase-1; GSEA,
  gene set enrichment analysis; TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes.
