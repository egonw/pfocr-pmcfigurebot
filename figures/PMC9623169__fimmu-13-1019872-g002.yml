caption: Function analysis of DEGs. (A) The gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis
  of co-upregulated DEGs in gills, foregut and hindgut between the control and SVCV-infected
  groups. The X-axis indicates the GO terms, and the Y-axis indicates the degree of
  enrichment in this term. (B) The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
  enrichment analysis of co-upregulated DEGs in gills, foregut and hindgut. The X-axis
  indicates the rich factors of corresponding pathways, and the Y-axis indicates the
  pathway names. The different colors of the dots represent the q-value, and the number
  of DEGs in each pathway is represented by the size of the dots. (C) A heatmap plot
  of DEGs involved in infectious diseases and immune-related pathways that are enriched
  in the control group versus the SVCV-infected group.
