caption: Harmine affected cancer-related progress. (A) Principle component analysis
  displaying the observable variation in the gene expression pattern under harmine
  treatment. The points in the red region represent the harmine-treated samples, whereas
  the points in the green region represent the control samples. (B) Volcano plot of
  the differentially expressed genes in response to harmine treatment. The down- and
  upregulated genes are shown in blue and red, respectively (log2fold change < -1
  or > 1; P < 0.05). (C) Heatmap showing two different gene expression patterns under
  harmine treatment. The up-and downregulated genes are shown in red and green. Each
  column represented a sample in the GEO dataset. (D-F) Gene ontology enrichment analysis
  of the differentially expressed genes; (D) molecular function; (E) cellular component;
  (F) biological progress; (G) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis
  of the differentially expressed genes. The size of the circle indicates the number
  of genes involved in the pathway, whereas the circle color represents the significance
  of enriched pathways (P < 0.05).
