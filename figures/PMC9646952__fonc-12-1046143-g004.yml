caption: CCK-8 and colony-formation assay results of cells treated with PD, CTX, and
  Akt regulators. (A) The inhibitory effects of CTX and LY294002 treatment in HCT116
  and LoVo cells were examined by CCK-8 assay after treatment for 48 h. ‘LY’ represents
  LY294002. The inhibitory effect of ‘CTX+LY’ is significantly higher than that of
  ‘CTX’ at all concentrations, as determined by one-way ANOVA (P<0.05). (B) SC79 (4
  μg/ml) was administered concomitantly with PD. The inhibitory effects of PD+SC79
  and/or CTX treatment in HCT116 and LoVo cells were examined by CCK-8 assay after
  treatment for 48 h. (C) The CCK-8 assay results of PD+SC79 and/or CTX treatment
  were analyzed with the CalcuSyn software. Combination Index (CI) was calculated
  by the Calcusyn software. CI < 1 was considered synergistic, CI = 1 Tadditive, and
  CI > 1 antagonistic cytotoxicity. (D) The colony-formation assay was performed,
  and the results are displayed as colony numbers in the column diagram. HCT116 cells
  were treated with 5 μM PD and 10 μg/ml CTX, whereas LoVo cells were treated with
  6 μM PD and 20 μg/ml CTX. Cells were treated with 4 µg/ml SC-79 and 10 µM LY294002.
  ‘LY’ represents LY294002. Columns showed mean ± S.D. ‘CTX’ was compared with ‘CTX+LY’
  or ‘CTX+PD+SC79’ using one-way ANOVA. *P < 0.05 represents a significant difference.
