caption: QTL analysis and physical mapping of seed germination-related genes. Genes
  associated with seed germination corresponding to cell function, embryo development,
  hormone, signaling, seed development, seed dormancy, and seed germination were identified
  in RM7197-RM15063, RM528-RM20632, and RM23314-RM23178 on chromosomes 3, 6, and 8,
  respectively. Among them, OSK3 (SnRK) which plays a key role in the ABA signaling
  pathway was screened.
