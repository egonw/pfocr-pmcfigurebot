figure_title: PLEKHH2 activates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by promoting FAK phosphorylation
caption: A The SMART database was used to analyze the cellular functions of proteins
  containing the FERM domain. B The GSEA database predicted that PLEKHH2 was enriched
  in focal adhesion assemblies. C Overexpression of PLEKHH2 promotes FAK phosphorylation,
  which plays an important role in the focal adhesion assembly process. PLEKHH2 knockdown
  decreased FAK phosphorylation, but the total protein level of FAK did not change
  significantly. D After inhibiting the activity of the FAK via PF573228 treatment
  in A549 and H1299 cells, an increase in PLEKHH2 expression did not increase p-PI3K,
  p-AKT, or other proliferation-, migration-, and invasion-related proteins. Statistical
  analysis is shown in Supplementary Fig. A and . Results of the clone formation assay
  (E, Statistical analysis is shown in Supplementary Fig. C and ), CCK-8 assay (F),
  and Matrigel Transwell assay (G, Statistical analysis is shown in Supplementary
  Fig. E and ) showed that, following the inhibition of FAK phosphorylation, the upregulation
  of PLEKHH2 did not significantly promote cell proliferation and invasion ability.
  P < 0.05 indicates statistical significance, *P < 0.05.
