caption: 'The function of Jasmonic acid (JA) in plant growth and development. In the
  reproductive growth stage, bHLH IIIe transcription factors (TFs), MYCs, and MYBs
  promote stamen development. JA interacts with AP2 family TOEs to inhibit FT transcription
  and regulate plant flowering. In the vegetative growth stage, MYCs and ASA jointly
  inhibit the elongation of the taproot; MYCs interact with SAG to activate JA-induced
  leaf senescence; MYC and downstream NAC TFs promote stomatal opening; HD-ZIP family
  members (HDs) activate the expression of expansion proteins gene (ESP) and regulate
  trichome formation; JA also inhibits seed germination through COI1. In addition,
  MYC and ERF jointly promote tissue regeneration. Arrows: Activations; Bar-headed
  arrows: Repressions.'
