caption: Chemokine CXCL17 and its receptor GPR35 exhibit higher levels in CRC drug-resistant
  tissues and cells. A. Differential gene volcano plot between OXA-sensitive and OXA-resistant
  groups in CRC tissues; B. Box plot of CXCL17 expression in OXA-sensitive and OXA-resistant
  tumor tissues; C. Western-blot detection of CXCL17 and GPR35 protein expression
  levels in FHC and HCT15 cells; D. RT-qPCR detection of mRNA expression of CXCL17
  and GPR35. **P < 0.01, compared with the FHC group.
article_title: Activation of the IL-17 signalling pathway by the CXCL17-GPR35 axis
  affects drug resistance and colorectal cancer tumorigenesis.
