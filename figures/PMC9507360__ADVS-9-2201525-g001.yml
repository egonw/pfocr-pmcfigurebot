caption: 'The demonstration of the artificial thermal sensing neural pathway capable
  of “in‐skin” learning: a) Measurement of temperatures of a human forehead and arm.
  b,c) The measured temperature was confirmed using commercial infrared thermometer.
  d) Temperature monitoring of exhaled human breath during respiration. e) Real‐time
  response of the sensor attached to the robotic finger when heated using hot air
  gun. f) Real‐time sensor response attached to the robotic to discriminate between
  cold and hot water in a cup. g) Schematic illustration of a robot hand approaching
  toward object with unknown temperature and sensing at the same time. h) Experimental
  demonstration of the robot''s reaction toward three temperature classes: human‐friendly
  touch, painful hot, and cold feelings. The photos showing the acquired pain reflex
  after associative learning on the skin. i) Robot''s hurriedly reflex to very painful
  sensations when a pre‐heated red‐hot rod at 360 °C approached toward its hand.'
