caption: The daf-9 steroid hormone pathway is necessary for and promotes dauer exit.
  (A) Steroid hormone biosynthetic pathway. DAF-9 catalyzes the final oxidation step
  required to form all known endogenous ligands of DAF-12, which promote reproductive
  development over dauer. Figure adapted from  and . (B) Dose response curve for the
  efficacy of Δ7-DA to rescue the dauer exit defect of daf-9(dh6) mutants. daf-9(dh6)
  full dauers were transferred to favorable conditions containing various concentrations
  of Δ7-DA, and 24 h later animals were scored for complete dauer exit. Lower concentrations
  yielded partially exited dauers, whereas 100 nM induced nearly all animals to completely
  exit dauer. (C) Overexpression of daf-9 from the hypoderm-specific and dauer-specific
  promoter col-183p in a wild-type background promotes dauer exit. For B and C, each
  dot is a biological replicate of scored dauer exit plates, with each group having
  a total n≥100 animals. **P<0.01 (bootstrapped permutation test using 104 samples).
