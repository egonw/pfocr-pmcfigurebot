caption: Differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in drought-tolerant (DT) and drought-sensitive
  (DS) chickpea genotypes under control (C) and drought stress (D) conditions. DAPs
  in the DT and DS genotypes were identified under drought stress as compared to control,
  DT(D/C) and DS(D/C), respectively, and between DT and DS genotypes under control
  condition, [DT(C)/DS(C)]. (A) Venn diagram showing common and specific DAPs in DT(D/C),
  DS(D/C) and DT(C)/DS(C) comparisons, where total number of proteins are shown by
  black color font, and up- and down-regulated proteins are presented by red and blue
  color fonts, respectively. (B, C) Bubble plots showing significantly enriched pathways
  among up- (B) and down-regulated (C) proteins in DT(D/C), DS(D/C) and DT(C)/DS(C)
  comparisons. Top 20 pathways with P-value ≤ 0.05 were selected. The bubble size
  defines the number of proteins assigned to the pathway and bubble color represents
  P-value as per the given scale.
