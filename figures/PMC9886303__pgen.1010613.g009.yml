figure_title: Model for GRK-2 modulation of locomotion behaviors in C. elegans
caption: GRK-2 positively controls (A) crawling and swimming by acting in premotor
  interneurons in a manner that depends on the D2-like dopamine receptor DOP-3 [,]
  and (B) exploration by acting in ciliated neurons in an opposite way from EGL-4.
  We propose a model in which GRK-2 acts in multiple ciliated sensory neurons to positively
  control sensory perception and (1) inhibit the activity of the EGL-4 kinase in the
  same ciliated neurons, (2) negatively regulate the neuropeptide receptor NPR-1 in
  RMG interneurons in a cell-nonautonomous way (e.g. by regulating the level of secretion
  of an NPR-1 ligand), and (3) negatively control the levels of FLP-1 secretion from
  AVK interneurons. AVKs play critical roles in regulating locomotion by modulating
  motor neuron activity []. Since the ciliated neurons and AVK interneurons do not
  have direct connections, we propose that GRK-2 controls FLP-1 secretion from AVK
  interneurons in a cell-nonautonomous way through a neuromodulatory pathway. Proteins
  that positively regulate crawling, swimming, or exploration are shown in green and
  proteins that negatively regulate crawling, swimming, or exploration are shown in
  red. Dashed lines show indirect interactions. Created with BioRender.com.
