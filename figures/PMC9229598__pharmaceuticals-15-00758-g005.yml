caption: 'Rh3 (20 and 40 µM) inhibits EMT progression via the ERK pathway in A549
  and PC9 cells. Treatment of the cells with 100 μM CoCl2 for 24 h. Western blotting
  (A) and qRT-PCR (B) shows the expression levels of N-cadherin, E-cadherin, Vimentin,
  Snail, HIF-1α, p-ERK, ERK, and VEGF in A549 and PC9 cells. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001 compared with the control; # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, ### p < 0.001
  compared with control cells treated with CoCl2.'
