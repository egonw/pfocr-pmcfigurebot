caption: Metabolic vulnerabilities of PHGDH and PSAT1 knockouts with IDH2 overexpression
  in HCC38 cells. A, Pathway scheme depicts the diverted glycolysis to the TCA cycle
  through serine synthesis mediated by PHGDH and PSAT1. B–G, Decreased isotopologue
  abundances of glutamate, αKG, citrate, malate, aspartate, and fumarate from 13C5-glutamine
  upon PHGDH & PSAT1 knockout with transient IDH2-overexpressing HCC38 cells. H–I,
  Decreased OCRs in the basal and maximal respiration in the Mito stress assay measured
  using Seahorse flux analyzer. *, P < 0.05; * *, P < 0.01.
