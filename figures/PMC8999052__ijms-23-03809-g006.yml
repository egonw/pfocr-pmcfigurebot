caption: Graphical representation of networks identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  (IPA). (A) The network of lipid metabolism was merged with energy production and
  endocrine system disorders. Increased proteins are indicated in red and decreased
  proteins are indicated in green. (B) Graphical representation of the network of
  glomerular injury. Increased proteins are indicated in red and decreased proteins
  are indicated in green.
