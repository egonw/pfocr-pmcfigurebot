caption: Untargeted metabolomics analysis showed significant lactate accumulation
  at 4- and 5-day post inoculation (dpi) of sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV). (A) Maize
  plants and the first systemically infected maize leaves (1 SLs) of mock-inoculated
  or SCMV-infected maize plants at 4 and 5 dpi. Maize leaves (n=6) were harvested,
  pooled, and used for untargeted metabolomics analysis. Red arrow indicates the manifestation
  of mosaic symptoms. Scale bars = 4 cm. (B) Relative accumulation levels of SCMV
  genomic RNA in 1 SLs determined by RT-qPCR at 4 and 5 dpi. The results are represented
  as the means ± SE (n=3). Statistical differences between the treatments were determined
  using unpaired Student’s t-test (two-tailed), ***P < 0.001. (C) Accumulation levels
  of SCMV coat protein (CP) in 1 SLs at 4 and 5 dpi through western blotting analysis.
  The actin bands in the lower panels are used to show sample loadings. M, Mock; S,
  SCMV. (D) Venn diagram displaying the numbers of differentially expressed metabolites
  identified at 4 dpi and 5 dpi. Lactate and palmitoleic acid were found in both groups.
  (E) Pathway enrichment analysis (GlobalTest) combined with pathway topology analysis
  (degree centrality and betweenness centrality) for SCMV-infected plants compared
  with mock-inoculated plants at 4 dpi. Metabolites are clustered in nodes with pathway
  impact on the X axis calculated by pathway topology analysis and plotted according
  to –log (p) values on the Y axis. SCMV-infected plants demonstrated multiple large
  nodes of altered metabolic pathways compared with mock-inoculated plants. (F) Pathway
  enrichment analysis (GlobalTest) combined with pathway topology analysis (degree
  centrality and betweenness centrality) for SCMV-infected plants compared with mock-inoculated
  plants at 5 dpi. (G) Relative accumulation of lactate contents in the Mock- or SCMV-infected
  samples harvested at 4 or 5 dpi through LC-MS/MS. The data are represented as the
  means ± SE (n=4). Statistical differences between the treatments were determined
  using unpaired Student’s t-test (two-tailed), **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
