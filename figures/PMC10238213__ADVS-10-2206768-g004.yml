caption: ERK signaling is activated in T cells during allograft rejection. A,B) Scatter
  plot showing the Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment results in the upregulated genes
  in graft‐infiltrating A) CD4+ T cells and B) CD8+ T cells. The dot size indicates
  the relative number of differentially expressed genes contained in the GO terms
  and the shade of the dots indicates the adjusted P value (padj) of the enrichment.
  C) Immunofluorescent staining of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p‐ERK1/2, green) and CD3
  (red) in graft sections from syngeneic (Control) or allogenic (Rejection) transplantation.
  D) Representative zebra plot and E) statistical graph for intranuclear phosphorylated
  ERK1/2 (p‐ERK1/2) levels in splenic and graft‐infiltrating T cell subsets. Fluorescent‐minus‐one
  (FMO) samples were used as isotype controls. F) Representative zebra plot and G)
  statistical graph for intranuclear phosphorylated c‐Fos (p‐c‐Fos) levels in splenic
  and graft‐infiltrating T cell subsets. H,I) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
  shows an enrichment of ERK1/2‐related pathway up‐ and downregulated genes in the
  transcriptome of T cells from a rejected renal allograft. Data are shown as means ± SEM
  of at least three independent experiments. **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001, Student's
  t‐test.
