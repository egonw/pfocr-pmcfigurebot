caption: HMGB1 is the downstream target of miR-140-3p. A. The binding sequence between
  miR-140-3p and HMGB1 3’-UTR. B. Dual-luciferase reporter gene experiment was used
  to verify the targeting relationship between miR-140-3p and HMGB1. C. qRT-PCR and
  D. Western blot were used to detect HMGB1 mRNA and protein expression in ASMCs transfected
  with miR-140-3p mimics or inhibitors and stimulated by 20 ng/mL PDGFBB. Data are
  expressed as mean ± standard deviation (n=3). **; P<0.01, ***; P<0.001, HMGB1; High
  mobility group box 1, qRT-PCR; Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction,
  ASMCs; Airway smooth muscle cells, and PDGF-BB; Platelet-derived growth factor.
