caption: Pathway analysis of primary IECs in the co-culture system. (A) Top 20 GO
  annotations were enriched from 52 DEGs associated with inflammation. (B) Top 20
  KEGG pathways were enriched from 52 DEGs associated with inflammation. Apo-LF represents
  individual treatment with 10 g/L apo-LF, LPS represents individual treatment with
  1 mg/L LPS and apo-LF + LPS represents combined treatment with of 10 g/L apo-LF
  and 1 mg/L LPS.
