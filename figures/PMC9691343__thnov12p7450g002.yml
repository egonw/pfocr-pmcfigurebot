caption: Hpcal1 deletion promotes lipid metabolism in livers. (A) Pathway enrichment
  analysis of the differential expression genes from the RNA-sequencing datasets of
  liver tumors of WT (n=3) and Hpcal1-/- (n=3) mice. (B) Gene set enrichment analysis
  (GSEA) showed enrichment of cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis in liver tumors
  of Hpcal1-/- (n=3) mice compared with WT mice. (C) Heatmap demonstration of the
  gene expression related to cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis. (D) Realtime
  PCR analysis of the mRNA levels of genes related to cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis.
  (E) Western blotting analysis of the cell lysates from liver tumors of WT and Hpcal1-/-
  mice with indicated antibodies. (F) Determination of hepatic total cholesterol (TG)
  and total triglyceride (TG) from liver tumors of WT (n=5) and Hpcal1-/- (n=5). (G)
  Representative images and statistical analysis of Oil Red O staining of liver sections
  from WT and Hpcal1-/-. Staining intensity of 2 fields per liver section from 5 mice
  of indicated group were calculated using Image J software. Scale bar, 25 µm. (H)
  Representative IHC images of HPCAL1, ACSS2 and SCD1 of liver sections from WT and
  Hpcal1-deficient mice. Unpaired t test was used to determine statistical significance.
  Scale bar, 50 µm. *, **, *** means p < 0.05, p < 0.01, and p < 0.001.
