figure_title: Profiles of CXXC5 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the skin tissues of
  human DFU patients
caption: 'a Gene set enrichment analysis of microarray transcriptome data from patients
  with DFUs to determine the Wnt/β-catenin signaling-activated gene signature. Black
  columns indicate 283 enriched genes involving the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
  in the skin tissues of non-DFU or DFU patients (n = 3). ES, enrichment score; NES,
  normalized enrichment score; FDR, false discovery rate; P: p-value. b-d The skin
  tissues of non-DFU or DFU regions from patients with DFUs (Supplementary Table ).
  b Representative IHC images of CXXC5 and β-catenin expression in the dermis layers
  of skin tissues (n = 3). Scale bars, 100 µm. c Quantitative mean intensity of IHC
  staining of cytosolic CXXC5 and nuclear β-catenin was determined and is presented
  as the correlation of cytosolic CXXC5 with nuclear β-catenin (n = 10). d Representative
  images of DAB staining of angiogenesis markers, such as CD31, VEGFA, VEGFR2, and
  CD34 (n = 3). Scale bars, 100 µm. All data are presented as the mean ± SD. *p < 0.05;
  **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001 determined by Student’s t test.'
