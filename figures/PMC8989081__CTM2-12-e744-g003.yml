caption: RNA sequencing reveals that NSD2 and Aurora A alter the transcriptome of
  multiple myeloma (MM) cells to adapt drug resistance. (A) Heat map of differently
  expressed genes in Aurora A‐KO LP‐1 cells by bulk RNA sequencing. Gene expression
  is shown in normalized log2 counts per million. (B) Volcano plot showing differentially
  expressed genes in Aurora A‐KO LP‐1 cells. Number of genes downregulated or upregulated
  in Aurora A‐KO LP‐1 cells is shown on the top (fold change > 1.2; adjusted p value < .05).
  (C) GSEA analysis shows genes enrichment in multiple drug resistance pathway in
  Aurora A‐KO sample. (D) Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) validating
  the target genes in bortezomib‐resistant (BR) and wild‐type (WT) LP‐1 cells. (E)
  ChIP‐PCR results showing binding of promoters of LRP1, IL6R, STC2, TCEA2 and GNG7
  in LP‐1 and MM.1S cells using anti‐H3K36me2 and normal rabbit IgG. (F) ChIP‐qPCR
  results showing the relative enrichment abundance of H3K36me2 on promoters of LRP1,
  IL6R, STC2, TCEA2 and GNG7 genes in NSD2‐KO‐KMS‐11 cells. (G) qPCR validating the
  target genes in Aurora A‐KO and NSD2‐KO LP‐1 cells. (H) The prognostic value of
  IL6R (left) and TCEA2 (right) in the overall survival curve in database GSE9782
  (cutoff, median). ** p < .01; *** p < .001
