caption: TUDCA relieves PA-induced insulin resistance via activating Nrf2/ARE signaling
  pathway. The content of ROS in (A) primary hepatocytes and (B) HepG2 cells. The
  ratio of GSH/GSSG in (C) primary hepatocytes and (D) HepG2 cells. (E) Protein levels
  of p-Nrf2 and Nrf2 were determined by western blotting in primary mouse hepatocytes
  and HepG2 cells. (F) Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of Nrf2, Ho-1, Nqo1 and Gpx4 in
  primary mouse hepatocytes and HepG2 cells. (G) Glucose uptake by cells and (H) glucose
  content of the medium supernatant measured in Nrf2 knock-down HepG2 cells. (I) Glucose
  uptake by cells and (J) glucose content of the medium supernatant were measured
  in primary hepatocytes from Nrf2−/− mice. (K) Immunoprecipitation. HepG2 cells were
  treated with or without TUDCA (20 μM), and then lysates were immunoprecipitated
  with the indicated antibodies, followed by western blotting. (L) Docking of TUDCA
  with Kelch domain of KEAP1. The residues of KEAP1 were represented using sticks
  or surface structures, TUDCA was shown in pink, the dashed lines (blue) represent
  hydrogen-bonding interactions. Results from three independent experiments are expressed
  as mean ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001. ROS, reactive oxygen species;
  GSH, glutathione; GSSG, oxidized glutathione; PA, palmitic acid; TUDCA, tauroursodeoxycholic
  acid. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the
  reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)
