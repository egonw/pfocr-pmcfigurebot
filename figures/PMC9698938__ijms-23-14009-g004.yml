caption: Hepatocyte-specific DAX1 deletion elevates CD4+ helper and CD8+ cytotoxic
  T-cell recruitment to the liver following ConA administration. WT and Dax1 LKO mice
  were treated with a single administration of ConA (15 mg/kg, i.v.) or PBS. lntrahepatic
  immune cells were isolated at 6 h (PBS; n = 3, ConA; n = 6) post treatment and analyzed
  via fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Cell surface markers, including CD45, CD3e,
  CD4, and CD8a, were used to characterize CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. (a) Absolute number
  of whole liver immune cells (CD45+). (b,c) The percentages of CD4+T cells (CD45+CD3+CD4+)
  and CD8+ T cells (CD45+CD3+CD8+) were determined, and the representative scatterplots
  are shown. (d) Absolute number of CD4+ T cells (CD45+CD3+CD4+) and CD8+ T cells
  (CD45+CD3+CD8+) were determined. (e) Immunohistochemical liver staining for T cells
  (CD3, arrows) was conducted, and representative images are shown. CD3+ cells were
  counted in 4 randomly selected fields. Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM. Tukey–Kramer
  test after the one-way ANOVA was used to compare the ConA-treated LKO and ConA-treated
  WT groups; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001.
