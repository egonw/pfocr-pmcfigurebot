caption: Relative expression of putative candidate genes in leaves of galphimine producer
  plants (GP) and non-galphimine producer plants (NGP) was calculated by the 2−ΔΔCt
  method in quantitative PCR analysis. Y-axis represents the fold change value between
  GP and NGP. AMPA (5’-AMP-activated protein kinase), Ser/Thr (serine/threonine-protein
  kinase AtPK2/AtPK19).
