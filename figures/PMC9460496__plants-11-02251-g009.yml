caption: The DEGs about photosynthesis pathway and photosynthesis-antenna proteins
  in two grazing treatments. Blue blocks mean down-regulated genes in light grazing
  treatment vs non-grazing treatment, dark blue blocks represent down-regulated genes
  in heavy grazing treatment vs non-grazing treatment, dark red blocks indicate up-regulated
  genes in heavy grazing treatment vs non-grazing treatment, red blocks mean up-regulated
  co-expression genes in light grazing treatment vs non-grazing treatment and heavy
  grazing treatment vs non-grazing treatment.
