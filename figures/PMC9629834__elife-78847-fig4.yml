figure_title: Temporal trajectories of the corticostriatal axonal proteome
caption: '(A) Heat map showing temporal expression across development. Protein clusters
  were defined using a time course regression analysis implemented in maSigPro R package.
  The row dendrogram shows hierarchical clustering of proteins in each protein cluster.
  Log2 protein abundance was normalized to the mean of the neonatal time point. All
  biological replicates are shown in columns. (B) Temporal trajectories of protein
  expression in each cluster. Log2 protein abundance was normalized to the mean of
  the neonatal time point. Red lines represent the average expression of all proteins
  in a cluster. Gray lines represent individual protein trajectories. Neonate (P5),
  early postnatal (P11), preweanling (P18–20), and adult (P50). (C) SynGO analysis
  of presynaptic protein maturation, annotated by gene names. Proteins mapped to SynGO
  presynapse ontology term were grouped into seven categories: presynapse, cytosol-cytoskeleton-endosome,
  presynaptic membrane, presynaptic active zone, presynaptic endocytic zone, presynaptic
  ribosome and ER, and neuronal dense core vesicle. Heatmap shows log2 protein abundance
  normalized to neonatal time point. Three categories, presynaptic membrane, presynaptic
  active zone, and presynaptic endocytic zone are shown. Remaining categories are
  in . (D) Over-representation analysis of protein clusters for central nervous system
  (CNS) traits and disorders. Dot size indicates the number of genes enriched for
  a particular disease. Color density indicates the degree of significance, –log(pvalue).
  Only significantly enriched diseases are shown. AD (Alzheimer’s disease), EP (Epilepsy),
  BP (bipolar disorders), and ASD (Autism spectrum disorders). (E) Reactome pathway
  enrichment analysis for protein clusters that are associated with CNS traits and
  disorders (clusters 2, 4, 7, and 8). Top 5 Reactome pathway terms are plotted. Gray
  bar indicates –log(p value). (F) KEGG axon guidance pathway analysis, annotated
  by gene names. Heatmap of normalized Log2 protein abundance for proteins mapped
  to the KEGG axon guidance pathway (mmu04360). Left, protein abundance for kinases
  and phosphatases clustered by family. Right, other proteins in the pathway.'
