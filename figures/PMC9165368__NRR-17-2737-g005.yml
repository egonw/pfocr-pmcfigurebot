caption: 'Bioinformatics analysis of differentially expressed genes.(Aâ€“C) Seventy-six
  differentially expressed genes were classified as cellular component (A), molecular
  function (B), and biological process (C) by GO analysis. (D) Functional enrichment
  analysis of differentially expressed genes relating to pathways by KEGG pathway
  analysis. Ferroptosis, calcium signaling pathway, serotonergic synapse, HIF-1 signaling
  pathway, cholinergic synapse, and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction were the
  significantly enriched functional pathways. (E) STRING software shows the functional
  linkage between differentially expressed genes. GO: Gene Ontology; KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes; STRING: Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins.'
