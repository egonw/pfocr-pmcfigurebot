caption: Impact of ERK1/2 signaling inhibition on DA-induced osteogenesis in PDLSCs.
  (a, b) Western blot analysis demonstrates DA-promoted ERK1/2 phosphorylation and
  its attenuation by D1 and D2 receptor antagonists. (c, d) Western blot analysis
  demonstrates osteogenic differentiation is reduced by D1R antagonist or ERK1/2 inhibitor
  alone, with a greater reduction when combined. (e, f) Western blot analysis demonstrates
  osteogenic differentiation is reduced by D2R antagonist or ERK1/2 inhibitor alone,
  with a greater reduction when combined. Statistical significance was determined
  using unpaired one-way ANOVA for multiple-group. (∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001;
  ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001).
