caption: Histone modifications in epigenetic mechanisms are indispensable for the
  development and progression of cervical cancer (A) p300 promotes the acetylation
  of histone H3K27, H3K9 and H4K16, and enhances the expression of HPVE6/E7 by promoting
  the recruitment of RNA polymerase (Pol II) to the long control region (LCR) of HPV18
  to promote the development of cervical cancer. (B) Tip60 inhibits RNA pol II recruitment
  of HPV18LCR by enhancing H3K27 and H4K5 acetylation, thereby inhibiting HPVE6/E7
  expression and suppressing cervical carcinogenesis. (C) HDAC1 interacts with the
  nuclear matrix protein SMAR1 to inhibit the recruitment of c-Fos to the E6 promoter
  to suppress HPVE6 transcription and suppress cervical cancer development. (D) HDAC10
  promotes the deacetylation of histone H3 and H4 to suppress the expression of matrix
  metalloproteinases (MMP2 and MMP7) and further suppress the development of cervical
  cancer. (E) HDAC10 up-regulates TXNIP protein by inhibiting the expression of miR-223,
  leading to the overexpression of TXNIP inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin pathway carcinogenesis.
