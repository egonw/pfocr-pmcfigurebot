caption: Identification of DEGs and signalling pathways in different ICD subtypes.
  We plotted the result with the R software (version 4.2.2 https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-4/).
  (A) Volcano plot shows the quantified DEG distribution between the ICD-high and
  ICD-low subtypes (log2-fold change > 1 or log2-fold change < − 1, P < 0.05). (B)
  Circos plot shows the GO signalling pathway enrichment analysis results. (C) Circos
  plot presents the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis results. The size of the dot
  represents the gene count, and the colour of the dot represents the − log10 (p.
  adjust value) value. (D) GSEA identified potential signalling pathways between the
  ICD-high and ICD-low subtypes.
