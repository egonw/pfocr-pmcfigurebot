figure_title: CuET induces cell death in a p53-independent manner
caption: 'A. Representative light microscope images following treatment of A549 or
  U2OS cells with various concentrations of CuET for different time points. Scale
  bar: 10 μM. B CuET dose-response curves in A549 and U2OS cells. GI50 values are
  shown in the table with 95% confidence intervals, along with R2 values quantifying
  the goodness of fit (data are shown as mean ± SD, n = 3 biological replicates).
  C Cell survival analysis (resazurin) in A549 cells treated with siRNA against TP53 +/−
  various concentrations of CuET for 24 h. D Quantitative RT-PCR of various p53 targets
  in A549 cells treated with CuET (6 h) +/− siRNA against TP53 (data are shown as
  mean ± SD, n = 3 biological replicates, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05, non-significant values
  are not shown). E Barplot of pathway enrichment terms (Reactome) for genes that
  are monotonically up-or down-regulated following CuET treatment. F Scatterplot depicting
  the correlation of Reactome terms among DE genes affected by CuET or thapsigargin.'

  and ribosome biogenesis stress evoked by the disulfiram metabolite CuET.
