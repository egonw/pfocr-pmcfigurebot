caption: 'Suppression of RhoA/ROCK1 attenuated cell apoptosis and inflammation and
  increased cell viability. (A) The mRNA expression of RhoA, ROCK1, ROCK2 and Cx43
  in mRMVECs treated with high glucose (30 mM glucose) or ROCK inhibitors (Y-27632,
  10 µM; fasudil, 30 µM). (B, C) The protein expression of RhoA, ROCK1, ROCK2 and
  Cx43 in mRMVECs treated with high glucose or ROCK inhibitors. (D, E) Apoptosis of
  mRMVECs treated with high glucose or ROCK inhibitors. (F) Viability of mRMVECs treated
  with high glucose or ROCK inhibitors. (G) The expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6
  in the cell supernatant after treatment with high glucose or ROCK inhibitors. *P
  < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001 compared with the control group;
  #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, ####P < 0.0001 compared with the high glucose (30 mM) group.
