caption: PREPL knockdown increases total levels of palmitoylated proteins. (A) Schematic
  representation of the ABE protocol steps. The free thiol groups from the total protein
  lysate were blocked with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). Next, the palmitoyl groups were
  cleaved using hydroxylamine (HAM). After depalmitoylation, the remaining thiol groups
  were biotinylated. Lysates containing the palmitoylated proteins tagged with biotin
  were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes
  were stained with biotin/streptavidin, and band intensities were quantified using
  ImageJ. (B) Using Ellman’s reagent, the percentage of free thiol groups was quantified
  after treatment with different concentrations of NEM for 16 hours at 4°C. (C) The
  percentage of free thiol groups after each step of the ABE protocol, using Ellman’s
  reagent. (D) The biotinylation of palmitoylated thiol groups was probed with streptavidin
  IRDye 800CW. Representative blot of two independent experiments. As a loading control,
  the blot was probed with tubulin. (E) Band intensities of biotinylated proteins
  were measured by densitometry in different regions of interests (ROIs) using ImageJ.
  The measurements were made at all of the different molecular weights. Each dot represents
  an individual densitometry measurement of bands in a selected ROI. The biotin intensities
  were normalized to endogenous control. Data are the mean of two independent experiments
  with two different shPREPL constructs. Welch’s t test; ****P < 0.0001. (F) N2A cell
  proliferation rates were obtained by measuring the number of viable cells at different
  time points (0–72 hours) in the absence or presence of palmostatin M (20 and 50
  μM) as described in Materials and Methods. (G) DOR internalization was measured
  by ELISA using N2A cells treated with 1 μM deltorphin II for 0–120 minutes in the
  absence or presence of palmostatin M (20 μM) as described in Materials and Methods.
  (H) CB1R internalization was measured by ELISA using N2A cells treated with 100
  nM of HU210 for 0–120 minutes in the absence or presence of palmostatin M (20 μM)
  as described in Materials and Methods. Data (G and H) represent mean ± S.D. (n =
  3).
