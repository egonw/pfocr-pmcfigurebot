caption: Role of short-chain fatty acids in non-motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
  SCFAs have potential therapeutic value for non-motor symptoms of PD. SCFAs can promote
  enterochromaffin cells to secrete 5-HT through the p-CREB-AANAT signal pathway and
  combine with its role in promoting neurotrophic factors BDNF and GDNF and regulating
  neuroinflammation, which can effectively improve depressive symptoms. In addition,
  SCFAs can also promote the secretion of melatonin by intestinal chromaffin cells
  and regulate the peripheral biological clock. Also, SCFAs can combine with FFAR2
  and FFAR3 in the hepatoportal region to release signals to the central nervous system,
  increase NREMS sleep and reduce body temperature to enhance sleep. Finally, SCFAs
  can act on intestinal neurons and increase intestinal motility by inhibiting HDACs.
  Combined with their functions of inhibiting intestinal inflammation and enhancing
  the intestinal mucosal barrier, they can improve constipation symptoms. Created
