figure_title: STEAP2 inhibit PTC progression through blocking hedgehog signaling pathway
  and EMT
caption: 'A GSVA analysis showed that hedgehog signaling pathway and EMT in PTC with
  STEAP2-low expression compared with those with STEAP2-high expression was identified
  as the top three activation pathways based on TCGA analysis (red bar: acitivated
  pathways in STEAP2- low expression tissues; blue bar: In-citivated pathways in STEAP2-
  low expression tissues). B Effect of STEAP2 activation on the expression of Hedgehog
  signaling pathway-related proteins (SMO, Gli1, and PTCH1) in PTC cells. C Representative
  western blots showing changes in EMT markers (E-cadherin, N-cadherin, snail, vimentin,
  and β-catenin) in PTC cells after STEAP2 activation. Protein expression levels of
  Hedgehog signaling pathway-related proteins (Smo, Gli1 and PTCH1) (D) and the EMT
  markers (E-cadherin and N-cadherin) (E) in xenograft tumors were determined by IHC.
  All data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments.
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001.'
