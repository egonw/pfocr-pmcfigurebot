figure_title: GASP1 forms a positive feedback loop with IGF1/IGF1R pathway to enhance
  breast cancer cell growth and decrease their response to paclitaxel
caption: a The effect of ectopic expression of IGF1R in GASP1 knockout HCC1937 and
  MCF7 cells on cell proliferation, b colony formation, and the activities of IGF1/IGF1R,
  NF-κB, PI3K/AKT, and MAPK/ERK pathways c. GAPDH was used as a loading control. d
  Correlation analysis of GASP1 with IGF1 expression using the TCGA database. e Western
  blot analysis of GASP1 expression in the indicated cells treated with 100 ng/mL
  of IGF1 and PBS. f Western blot analysis of GASP1, phosphorylated AKT (p-AKTS473),
  total AKT (t-AKT), phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK), and total ERK (t-ERK) in MDA-MB-231
  and DU4475 cells treated with PI3K inhibitor (BEZ235, 1 μM), MEK inhibitor (GSK1120212,
  0.5 μM) and DMSO in the presence or absence of IGF1 (100 ng/mL). g, h The effect
  of GASP1 knockout or overexpression on the response of breast cancer cells to paclitaxel.
  Data were presented as mean ± SD. ***P < 0.001.
article_title: GASP1 enhances malignant phenotypes of breast cancer cells and decreases
  their response to paclitaxel by forming a vicious cycle with IGF1/IGF1R signaling
  pathway.
