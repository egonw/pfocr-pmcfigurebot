figure_title: Gain-of-function of STEAP2 inhibits the proliferation and migration
  of PTC cells
caption: 'A Expression of STEAP2 in normal human thyroid epithelial cell line and
  PTC cell lines were verified at the mRNA levels (upper panel) and protein levels
  (bottom panel) via qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. B The activation effect
  on STEAP2 was detected by qRT-PCR and western blot after transfection of BCPAP and
  TPC-1 cells with designed saRNAs targeting STEAP2 (sa-STEAP2#1 and sa-STEAP2#2)
  or negative control (sa-NC). C–E CCK-8 assay, colony formation assay, and EdU assay
  were used to determine the viability of BCPAP and TPC-1 cells after STEAP2 activation.
  Scale bar: 50 μm. F–H Transwell migration assay, transwell invasion assay, and wound
  healing assay was performed to evaluate the migration ability of BCPAP and TPC-1
  cells after STEAP2 activation. I The protein expression of metastasis-mediating
  proteins (MMP-2, MMP-7, and MMP-9) in PTC cells after indicated transfection was
  analyzed by western blot. All data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation
  of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001.'
