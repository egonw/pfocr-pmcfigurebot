caption: Z734–mediated HERC3 increasing promotes p53 level and p53 phosphorylation.
  (A) MCF–7 cells were treated with Z734 (10 μM) for 12 h and then mitochondrial and
  nuclear fractions were prepared. The levels of p53 protein in the mitochondrial,
  cytosolic, and nuclear fractions were assessed by Western blotting. GAPDH, cytosolic
  loading control; COX IV, mitochondrial loading control; Histone H3, nuclear loading
  control. (B) MCF–7 cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter containing
  tandem HERC3 consensus binding sites. Luciferase activity was assessed using a luciferase
  assay kit. (C) HERC3 mRNA levels in MCF–7 cells exposed to 0, 5, 10, and 15 μM Z734
  for 12 h were quantified by qRT–PCR. β–actin served as the internal control. (D)
  Western blot analysis of HERC3 expression in MCF–7 cells exposed to 0, 5, 10, and
  15 μM Z734 for 12 h. (E) MCF–7 cells were treated with Z734 (10 μM) for 12 h and
  transfected with Myc–HERC3, followed by Western blotting to detect p53 expression.
  (F) Wild–type (p53+/+) or p53 null (p53−/−) MCF–7 cells were transfected with empty
  vector or Myc–HERC3 along with a luciferase reporter containing tandem p53 consensus
  binding sites (pG13). Luciferase activity was assessed using a luciferase assay
  kit. Promoter activity is expressed as the ratio of luciferase to renilla activity
  (RLU, relative light units) 24 h post–transfection. (G) Interaction between p53
  and HERC3 was analyzed by co–immunoprecipitation in MCF–7 cells. IgG served as the
  negative control. (H) Myc–HERC3 was transfected into MCF–7 cells, and expression
  levels of total p53 and p53 phosphorylation on Ser15, Ser46, Ser 20 or Thr55 were
  detected. (I) Knockdown of HERC3 reduces p53 level and phosphorylation. The HERC3–knockdown
  cells with two siRNAs targeting different sequences of HERC3 were assessed by immunoblotting.
  (J) Total lysates from MCF–7 cells expressing HA–p53 in the presence of Myc–HERC3
  were subjected to IP with anti–HA, followed by Western blotting using the indicated
  antibodies. Data shown in (B,C) were used one–way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test.
  Data shown in F was used two–tailed Student’s t–test. All assays were performed
  in triplicate, and the data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, n.s., no significant difference.
