caption: 'NAA10 regulates the expression of related proteins involved in the Pirh2‐p53 signalling
  pathway. (A) The left‐most column: HE staining images in human OSCC tissue microarrays
  (TMAs) and tumour xenograft tissues of nude mice. The rest of three columns: Immunostaining
  of NAA10, Pirh2, p53 in human OSCC tissue microarrays (TMAs) and tumour xenograft
  tissues of nude mice. Magnification, 100×. (B) Stable silencing of endogenous NAA10
  increased expression of Pirh2, MMP‐2 and MMP‐9, but decreased p53. And stable expression
  of ectopic NAA10 decreased expression of Pirh2, MMP‐2 and MMP‐9, but increased p53
  in indicated cells. (C) Endogenous Pirh2 expression in CAL 27 and SCC‐15 cells was
  silenced by siRNA Scrambled siRNA (siCon) was used as a negative control. The effect
  of silencing Pirh2 on p53, MMP‐2 and MMP‐9 expression was detected by Western blot.
  The results were performed in triplicate'
