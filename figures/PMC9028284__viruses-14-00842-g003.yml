caption: HuNoV VP1 promotes the expression of AQP1. (A–C). VP1 promoted the production
  of AQP1. (D,E). VP1 promoted the activation of AQP1 promoter. Caco2 cells were co-transfected
  with empty vector or VP1-expressing plasmid and AQP1-Luc or AQP4-Luc for 24 h. Cells
  were lysed and detected for the activity of Firefly luciferase. (F,G). VP1 promoted
  the transcription of AQP1. Caco2 cells were transfected with empty vector or VP1-expressing
  plasmid for 24 h (A,F,G). The protein levels of AQP1 and VP1 were measured by WB
  (A) and quantified using Image J (B,C). The transcription of AQP1 and AQP4 was evaluated
  by relative real-time quantitative PCR (F,G). AQP1 and AQP4 mRNA copies were normalized
  using GAPDH and expressed as fold increase in the value for the empty vector. (H,I).
  VP1 knockdown impaired HuNoV-induced AQP1 expression. Caco2 cells were transfected
  with VP1 specific siRNA for 4 h followed by transfection with full length HuNoV
  cDNA-expressing plasmid for another 24 h. The knockdown effect of VP1 siRNA and
  AQP1 expression were detected by WB (H). The relative intensities of AQP1 blots
  were quantified (I). For graphs, the data shown are mean ± S.D. of three independent
  experiments with each condition performed in triplicate. For images, one representative
  experiment out of three is shown. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, ns, not significantly.
