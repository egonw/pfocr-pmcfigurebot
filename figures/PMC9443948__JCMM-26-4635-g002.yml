caption: CoQ10 in the mitochondria, pathology of CoQ10 deficiency and oral supplementation.
  (A) The final steps of CoQ10 biosynthesis are carried out in the inner mitochondrial
  membrane. The CoQ10biosynthetic pathway includes both enzymes (in blue) and structural
  or regulatory components (in purple). Only the numbers in their names are shown
  for COQ proteins (COQ2‐7, COQ8A, COQ8B and COQ9). They are known to form a large
  complex, the CoQ biosynthetic complex or CoQ‐synthome. COQ10A and COQ10B whose functions
  are uncertain and not known to be part of the complex are not shown. The most essential
  function of CoQ10 is to transport electrons in the mitochondrial respiratory chain.
  Although CoQ10 is found in the mitochondrial membrane, in the figure this is not
  shown for clarity. (B) Primary CoQ10 deficiency predominantly manifests as mitochondrial
  disorder, with organs with high energy needs being most often affected. (C) Intestinal
  absorption of CoQ10 is thought to occur through the formation of mixed micelles
  with other dietary lipids. Once inside the enterocytes, CoQ10 is incorporated into
  chylomicrons (CM), which are transported via the lymphatics to the blood circulation.
  Because of its extreme hydrophobicity and its relatively large size, the absorption
  of orally administered CoQ10 has been reported to be poor
