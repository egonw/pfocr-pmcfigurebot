caption: Prevalence of anthropometric markers in the population. (A) The corporal
  mass distribution according to waist circumference is shown. (B) shows the distribution
  of body fat according to the waist-hip ratio. (C) shows the percentage of the population
  at risk of cardiovascular disease according to the waist-to-height ratio. (D) The
  percentage of the population with low weight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity
