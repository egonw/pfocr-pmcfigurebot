caption: KEGG enrichment bubble plot presentation. Each bubble represents a KEGG process.
  Enrichment indicates the proportion of the target in the list of targets. The size
  of bubble is positively correlated with the number of targets in each pathway; the
  larger the bubble is, the richer the gene is. âˆ’log10 indicates P value, the greener
  the color is, the larger P value is, and a redder color indicates a smaller P value.
  The top 15 KEGG for P values are shown above.
