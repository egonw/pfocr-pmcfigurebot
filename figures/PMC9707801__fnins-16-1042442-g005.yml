caption: Ferroptosis and NAFLD in Psychiatric Patients. A potential mechanistic link
  between ferroptosis and NAFLD is proposed using clinical benchmarks reported in
  psychiatric patients (black boxes). Specific data points reported for certain AA
  medications are noted; specifically, downregulation of GPx4 expression (*) in human
  cells following exposure to risperidone, volanaserine, or amisulpride () and pathway
  analysis indicating impaired lipid turnover in the liver of mice treated with olanzapine
  (**) ().
