caption: 'XBF inhibited IL-1β expression by inhibiting Casp11/NLRP3 inflammasome signaling
  pathway in RAW264.7 cells. (A-B) qRT-PCR determination of the mRNA expression of
  Nlrp1, Nlrp3, Nlrc4 (A) and Casp1, Casp8, Casp11 (B) in RAW264.7 cells upon treatment
  with XBF (2 and 3 mg/ml) for 24 h. (C) RAW264.7 cells were transfected with Casp11
  overexpression plasmid for 6 h, the expression of Casp11 mRNA were determined by
  qRT-PCR. (D-E) RAW264.7 cells were transfected with Casp11 overexpression plasmid
  and treated with XBF (2 mg/ml) for 24 h, the expression of IL-1β (d), iNOS, CD86
  (e) mRNA were determined by qRT-PCR. (F) RAW264.7 cells were transfected with Casp11
  overexpression plasmid and treated with XBF (2 mg/ml) for 24 h, the expression of
  iNOS was determined by western blotting. β-Actin was used as an internal control.
  (G) RAW264.7 cells were transfected with Casp11 overexpression plasmid and treated
  with XBF (2 mg/ml) for 24 h, the expression of Casp11 mRNA was determined by qRT-PCR.
  (H) RAW264.7 cells were transfected with Casp11 overexpression plasmid and treated
  with XBF (2 mg/ml) for 24 h, the expression of phosphorylated and total IκKα, IκBα,
  NF-κB, P38, and Erk were determined by western blotting. β-Actin was used as an
  internal control. Data are presented as the mean ± SE from three independent experiments.
