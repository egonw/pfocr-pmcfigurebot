caption: 'Functional enrichment: findings of enrichment for the KEGG pathway of genes
  that were differently up-regulated; Results of GO word enrichment analysis for genes
  that were significantly up-regulated; KEGG pathway enrichment findings of genes
  with differentially decreased expression levels; The GO word enrichment findings
  of differently down-regulated genes and the functional enrichment results were acquired
  using the R software program Cluster Profiler (Version: 3.18.0). The importance
  of differentially down-regulated genes is shown by various colors. The lower the
  FDR value is, the greater the value that is being referred to. The size of the circle
  is proportional to the number of genes that were enriched. In enrichment results,
  P & Lt; 0.05 or FDR & Lt; 0.05 considered to be enriched to a meaningful pathway,
  i.e., the right ruler of the enrichment diagram -log10 (P). GO = gene ontology,
  KEGG = Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes.'
