caption: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. Complement
  and coagulation cascade (p-adj. Bonferroni = 1.0 × 10−13) were the two main signaling
  pathways involved in bipolar disorder biological processes. Grey squares represent
  differentially expressed proteins found by three or more authors. A2M forms a complex
  with PCI, alpha a1AT, alpha 2AP. This complex of proteins inhibits PC. Furthermore,
  alpha2AP and A2M complex inhibits plasmin activity. C3 is part of the alternative
  pathway and integrates this pathway with classical and lectin pathways. This figure
  can be visualized in more details here (https://www.kegg.jp/kegg-bin/highlight_pathway?scale=1.0&map=map04610&keyword=
  coagulation). A2M, alpha-2-macroglobulin; PCI, protein C inhibitor; a1AT, alpha-1-antitrypsin;
  α2AP, alpha-2-antiplasmin; C3, third component of complement.
