caption: LAPTM5 promotes cell proliferation of breast cancer. (A and B) Cell Counting
  Kit-8 was used to evaluate cell proliferation of the two breast cancer cell lines
  at 0, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. (C and D) The effects of LAPTM5 upregulation or downregulation
  on cell cycle were detected by flow cytometry. The percentage of cells at different
  stages of cell cycles was statistically analyzed. (E and F) The protein expression
  of CyclinD1, CyclinA, CDK2 and CDK4 was examined by western blot analysis. β-actin
  served as loading control. Data originated from three independent experiments and
  are presented as the mean ± SD. **P<0.01. LAPTM5, lysosomal protein transmembrane
  5; ns, not significant; sh-, short hairpin; NC, negative control.
article_title: LAPTM5 regulated by FOXP3 promotes the malignant phenotypes of breast
  cancer through activating the Wnt/β‑catenin pathway.
