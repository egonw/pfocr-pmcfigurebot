caption: Metabolite profiling of U251 glioma cells overexpressing the COX4-1 or COX4-2
  isoform. (A) Two-dimensional PCA score plots of untargeted metabolomics data from
  COX4-1-overexpressing glioma cells (blue) and COX4-2-overexpressing glioma cells
  (red). (B) Volcano plot of metabolomic data. The x-axis represents the mean fold
  change (log2 ratio) in the relative intensity of each metabolite between the two
  samples (COX4-2-overexpressing relative to the COX4-1-overexpressing cells). The
  y-axis represents the statistical significance (-log10-transformed p-values) of
  each metabolite. Metabolites are color coded by metabolic pathway.
