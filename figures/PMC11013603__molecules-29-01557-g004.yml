caption: TIIA inhibited the PERK-ATF4-HSPA5 signaling pathway. TIIA-L, low concentration
  of TIIA (2.5 μM); TIIA-H, high concentration of TIIA (10 μM); ADR (2 μM). HepG2
  cells treated with TIIA for 24 h. (a) Expression levels of PERK mRNA. (b) The expressions
  of PERK, ATF4, HSPA5, GPX4, and p-PERK were measured using Western blot. (c) The
  fluorescence image of the laser confocal detection of the expression of PERK (green)
  on the HepG2 cell membrane and ATF4 (green) in HepG2 cells (10 × 60). Blue pseudocolor
  is fluorescent DNA dye (DAPI). Scale bar = 50 μm. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and ***
  p < 0.001 vs. control group.
