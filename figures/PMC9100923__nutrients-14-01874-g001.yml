caption: Illustration of the one-carbon metabolism (1CM) pathway and choline derivatives.
  The 1CM pathway is divided into the folate cycle, methionine cycle, and the choline
  pathway. The choline derivatives acetylcholine (Ach) and trimethylamine oxide (TMAO),
  and the endogenous choline synthesis pathway, catalyzed by phosphatidylethanolamine
  methyltransferase (PEMT), are also shown. THF = tetrahydrofolate; 5MTHF = 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate;
  MTHFR = methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; MTR = methionine synthase; MTRR = methionine
  synthase reductase; SAM = s-adenosylmethionine; SAH = s-adenosylhomocysteine; Hcy
  = homocysteine; DMG = dimethylglycine; BHMT = betaine homocysteine methyltransferase.
