figure_title: Proteomic profile of LF as determined by mass spectrometry analysis
  and bioinformatic analysis
caption: a A cluster heatmap showing differentially expressed proteins with over 2-fold
  changes between LFH and non-LFH samples. Red denotes elevated levels, while green
  denotes decreased levels. Red arrow denotes CLU. b Top 10 up- and top 10 downregulated
  proteins. Levels of CLU protein in LFH were elevated by >30-fold compared with the
  control. GO and KEGG pathway analysis. c–e GO terms for differentially expressed
  proteins (p < 0.05). The color shows the enrichment scores (−lg(p-value)), and the
  number of proteins tested is proportional to the marker area of the bubble of the
  significantly enriched GO terms. c Biological process (BP) GO terms. d Cellular
  component (CC) GO terms. e Molecular function (MF) GO terms. f Pathways associated
  with differentially expressed proteins in LFH (p < 0.05). g Protein‒protein interaction
  (PPI) analysis using the STRING tool showing functional association networks of
  differentially expressed proteins. The associations between nodes are connected
  with solid lines. Red marked rectangle shows CLU-TGF-β1 interactions.
