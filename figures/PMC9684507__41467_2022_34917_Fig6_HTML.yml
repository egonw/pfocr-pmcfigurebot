figure_title: rs28714259 risk (A) allele dysregulates genes following dexamethasone/doxorubicin
  combination treatment and contributes to an attenuated hypertrophy signaling
caption: 'Top genes identified by IPA (in red or green blocks with bold black frame)
  are depicted in the context of canonical pathways. Red: pro-hypertrophic genes AND
  upregulated under dexamethasone/doxorubicin combination by rs28714259 major (G)
  allele. Green: anti-hypertrophic genes AND down-regulated under dexamethasone/doxorubicin
  combination by rs28714259 major (G) allele. Small arrows placed on the right side
  of identified genes represent the effect of rs28714259 risk (A) allele, which consistently
  opposes the effect of major (G) allele. Only top genes (P-value <= 2.81 × 10−3)
  in the cardiac hypertrophy signaling pathway identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  are shown for simplicity. A complete list of the 31 genes identified is included
  in Supplementary Table .'
