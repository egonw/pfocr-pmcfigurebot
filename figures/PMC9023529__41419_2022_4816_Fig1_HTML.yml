figure_title: Regorafenib suppresses YAP1 signaling pathway in CCA cells
caption: A Venn diagram of the potential transcription factors in HuCCT1 and KKU-100
  cells of the regorafenib treatment group and solvent control group. B Ranking of
  the candidate upstream regulators of transcription inhibition from regorafenib treatment
  and solvent control groups predicted by Ingenuity pathway analysis with a 1.5-fold
  change cutoff. C Core analysis of the YAP1 and TAF4 signatures in regorafenib-treated
  and control HuCCT1 cells. D RT-PCR analysis of YAP1 downstream targets and S26 mRNA
  expression in regorafenib-treated HuCCT1 cells. E Luciferase reporter activity of
  TEAD in HuCCT1 and SNU-1079 cells treated with or without regorafenib. F Western
  blots showing YAP1 and p-YAP1 (Ser127 and Tyr357) protein levels after treatment
  of HuCCT1 cells with regorafenib (10 μM). Data are presented as the mean of three
  independent experiments ± SEM. The significance of the difference was determined
  using a nonparametric Mann–Whitney U-test. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
