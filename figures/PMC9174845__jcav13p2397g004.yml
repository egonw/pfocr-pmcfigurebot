caption: ADAR1 deficiency causes ovarian cancer cell cycle arrest. (A) KEGG analysis
  of differentially expressed genes when ADAR1 deficiency. (B) Heatmap of differentially
  expressed genes in cell cycle pathway when ADAR1 deficiency. (C) mRNA levels of
  genes in cell cycle pathway quantified by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR.
  (D) The representative scatter plot graph showed the cell cycle of SKOV3 and A2780
  cells with or without ADAR1 silence. (E) Cell cycles in (D) were shown in histograms.
  All data were shown as mean Â± SD from three independent experiments (***, P < 0.001;
  **, P < 0.01; *, P < 0.05).
