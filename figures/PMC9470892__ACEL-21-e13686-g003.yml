caption: 'Effect of GA‐D on biological characteristics of senescent hAMSCs induced
  by H2O2 by upregulating YWHAE expression. (a) Changes in the morphology of hAMSCs.
  (b) The production of β‐galactosidase. (c) The number of SA‐β‐gal positive cells.
  (d) The production of intracellular ROS levels by confocal measurement. (e) The
  levels of intracellular ROS by FACS measurement. (f) Cell cycle distribution of
  hAMSCs through flow cytometry after different treatments. (g) The number of hAMSCs
  at different stages of the cell cycle. (h) The expression of p16 and p21 was detected
  by western blotting. (i) Relative expression levels of p16 and p21. (j) Chondrocyte
  differentiation by toluidine blue (TB) staining, osteoblast differentiation by alkaline
  phosphatase (ALP) and alizarin red S (ARS) stainings. Scale bar: 2 mm, 100 μm. N = 3.
  Control, control group; H2O2, senescent group; GA‐D, GA‐D treatment group; mock‐vehicle,
  GA‐D treatment group plus empty carrier; h‐14‐3‐3ε, GA‐D treatment group plus YWHAE
  overexpression; sh‐14‐3‐3ε, GA‐D treatment group plus YWHAE knockdown; , mean ± standard
  deviation. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. GA‐D, ganoderic acid D; H2O2, hydrogen peroxide;
  hAMSC, human amniotic mesenchymal stem cell; ROS, reactive oxygen species.'
