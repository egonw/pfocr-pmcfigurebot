caption: Regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling by oxygen (O2)-dependent
  and O2-independent mechanisms. There are conflicting opinions on the effects of
  metabolic factors, particularly hyperglycemia, on the stability of HIF-α proteins
  (mainly HIF-1α). Refer to the main text for detailed description. Black arrows/lines
  and light blue boxes/ovals indicate components and processes of the HIF-α degradation
  pathway in oxygenated cells (black solid arrows/lines) or metabolic factors that
  may impair HIF-α stabilization in hypoxic conditions (black dashed line). Red arrows/lines
  and yellow boxes indicate oxygen-dependent (red solid arrows/lines) and oxygen-independent
  stimuli (red dotted lines) promoting the stabilization and transcriptional activity
  of HIF-α proteins. ROS = reactive oxygen species; PHDs = prolyl hydroxylase domain
  proteins; FIH-1 = factor-inhibiting HIF-1; Pro-OH = proline hydroxylation; N-OH
  = asparagine hydroxylation; VHL = von Hippel–Lindau; CBP = cAMP response element-binding
  protein; p300 = E1A binding protein p300; HRE = hypoxia-response element.
