caption: UvSTE50 affects conidiation in U. virens. (A) Colony morphology of the wild-type
  strain Jt209, the ΔUvste50 mutant, and the complemented strain Uvste50-c. All of
  the tested strains were incubated on PSA plates for 20 days. Bar, 5 mm. (B) Conidial
  production of Jt209, ΔUvste50 and Uvste50-c in liquid PSB, incubated for 6 days
  at 28 °C, and 150 rpm. Error bars represent SD. * indicates significant differences
  between ΔUvste50 and the wild-type/complemented strains, as estimated by Duncan’s
  new multiple range test (p < 0.05). (C) Conidial morphology and conidia germination
  of strains Jt209, ΔUvste50, and Uvste50-c. Conidia were harvested from 6-day-old
  liquid PSB cultures, and conidial germination was observed 20 h post-incubation.
  Bar, 20 μm.
