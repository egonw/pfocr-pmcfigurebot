caption: AXL receptor tyrosine kinase (AXL) was downregulated in rheumatoid arthritis
  fibroblast-like synovial cell (RA-FLS) and reduced proinflammatory cytokines. (a-d)
  A Western blot was applied to assess levels of AXL, inducible nitric oxide synthase
  (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in RA-FLS. (e-g) mRNA levels of AXL, interleukin-6
  (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were detected by real-time quantitative
  PCR (RT-qPCR). (h-j) Levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and nitric oxide (NO) in RA-FLS were
  detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01
  compared with the control group.
