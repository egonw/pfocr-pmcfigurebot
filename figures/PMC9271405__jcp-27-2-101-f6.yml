figure_title: Effect of DATS on expression of tricarboxylic acid cycle-associated
  proteins
caption: (A) Reactome pathway enrichment analysis of downregulated genes by DATS treatment
  in MCF-10A and SK-BR-3 cell lines. (B) Immunoblot analysis for ACO2 and DLST in
  MCF-10A and SK-BR-3 cells treated with DMSO (control) or indicated doses of DATS
  for specified time points. The numbers above bands represent fold change in expression
  relative to corresponding DMSO-treated controls. (C) Quantification of ACO2 and
  DLST expression in SK-BR-3 cells. Results combined from three independent experiments
  are shown as mean ± SD (n = 3) and statistical analysis was done by one-way ANOVA
  followed by Dunnett’s test. DATS, diallyl trisulfide; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide,
  DLST, dihydrolipoamide S-succinyltransferase; ACO2, aconitase 2; HDR, Homology directed
  repair; ATR, ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related; AP, abasic sites; PCNA, proliferating
  cell nuclear antigen.
