caption: Clinical features of the affected members in Family 2. (a) Pedigree structure
  of a four‐generation Chinese family with complex digital anomalies. Squares and
  circles denote males and females. Filled shapes indicate affected members. Individuals
  labeled with solidi are deceased. the arrow denotes the proband. Members marked
  with * are the participants in this study. (b) Clinical features of the proband
  (IV:2) and affected individuals (IV:5/IV:6/III:10/III:13/II:15) are listed in Table .
  (c) Sanger sequencing electropherograms of the variant (c.1728C>a, pY576X) identified
  in the GLI3 gene
article_title: Two nonsense GLI3 variants are associated with polydactyly and syndactyly
  in two families by affecting the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway.
