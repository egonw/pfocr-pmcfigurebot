caption: Oncogenic transformation of BEAS‐2BDIF via EGFR‐PI3K‐MAPK pathway upregulates
  USP28 and accelerates tumour cell growth. (A) Frequently occurring genetic alterations
  and expression changes in recurring oncogenic drivers found in NSCLC (ADC and SCC).
  Oncoprints generated with the online tool www.cbioportal.org. (B) mRNA expression
  of Spearman's correlation between USP28 and EGFR, HRAS, BRAF or PIK3CA in NSCLC
  (SCC and ADC). Correlation and P‐value generated with the online tool GEPIA www.gepia2.cancer‐pku.cn/
  using lung cancer TCGA publicly available data set. (C) Immunoblot against endogenous
  USP28 and the oncogenic transcription factor ∆NP63 in either BEAS‐2BDIF or BEAS‐2BDIF
  upon retroviral transduction to express the indicated oncogenes EGFR [wild‐type
  (WT) and L858R], HRAS (G12D), BRAF (V600E) and PIK3CA [wild‐type (WT), E545K and
  H1047R], respectively. Actin served as loading control. n = 3. (D) RT‐PCR of USP28,
  the SCC transcription factor ∆NP63 and its target cytokeratin 14 (KRT14) in BEAS‐2BUD,
  BEAS‐2BDIF or the various BEAS‐2BONC as presented in C. Shown are mean log2 fold
  change expression data, relative to actin, and normalized to the respective expression
  in BEAS‐2BUD and standard deviation (SD). Shown are mean values and SD of n = 3.
  (E) Relative cell numbers and assessment of growth capacity of BEAS‐2BUD, BEAS‐2BDIF
  or the various BEAS‐2BONC over a total of 4 days. Cell numbers were analysed at
  days 1, 2 and 4. Shown are relative mean values and standard deviation. n = 3 experiments.
  P‐values were calculated using the two‐tailed t‐test statistical analysis. *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 and ****P < 0.0001. (F) Schematic model of the various
  stages of oncogenic transformation, as recapitulated by the transdifferentiation
  from BEAS‐2BUD to BEAS‐2BDIF, and from BEAS‐2BDIF to BEAS‐2BONC (oncogenic transformed
  BEAS‐2BDIF). The observed increases recapitulate the increase in USP28 protein abundance
  as seen in human lung cancer samples. Exp., exposure; ONC, oncogenic. See also Figs .
