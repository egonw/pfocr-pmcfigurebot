caption: 'Type I interferons promote inflammation in renal tubular cells and kidney
  tissue. (A) Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of ISGs (Oasl2,
  Usp18) in MCT cells stimulated with increasing concentrations of IFNβ for 6 and
  24 h. Values for mRNA were normalized to GAPDH expression. Data are expressed as
  the Mean ± SEM of three independent experiments. *p ≤ 0.05 vs untreated control
  cells. (B) Time-course (minutes, m) for the activation of the TI-IFN pathway. Representative
  western blot of phosphorylated isoforms of STAT1, JAK1 and TYK2 in MCT cells stimulated
  with 1.0 mUI/ml IFNβ. Tubulin was used as loading control. (C,D) Activation of the
  NF-κB pathway. (C) Cells were stimulated as indicated in A and the mRNA expression
  of cytokines (Cxcl10, Ccl2, IL-6) assessed by PCR. Data are Mean ± SEM of three
  independent experiments. *p ≤ 0.05 vs untreated control cells. (D) Representative
  western blot of phosphorylated IκBα (upper panel) and detection of nuclear p65 expression
  by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy (green signal) (lower panel) in MCT
  cells stimulated with IFNβ for the indicated times (minutes, m). Original magnification
  ×400. Scale bar 10 µM. (E,F) Inhibition of the TI-IFN pathway by functional blockade
  of IFNAR (E) or pharmacological inhibition of TYK2/JAK1 (F). MCT cells were preincubated
  with 10 μg/ml neutralizing anti-IFNAR antibody (IFNAR-Ab) or with 2.5 μM PF-06700,841
  (PF) for 1 h before the addition of IFNβ for 6 h or 24 h Oasl2 mRNA expression was
  assessed by RT-PCR after 24 h whereas Cxcl10, Ccl2, and Il-6 gene expression were
  measured after 6 h. Results are shown as Mean ± SEM (n = 3). *p ≤ 0.05 vs untreated
  control cells; #p ≤ 0.05 vs IFNβ treatment. (G,H) Activation and functional analysis
  of TBK1/IKKε signaling. (G) MCT cells were stimulated with 1.0 mUI/ml IFNβ for the
  indicated times (minutes, m). Activation of TBK/IKKε was detected by their phosphorylated
  isoforms by western blot (pTBK1, upper panel) or confocal microscopy (pIRF3, lower
  panel). Original magnification ×400. Scale bar 10 µM. (H) Transcriptional response
  in MCT cells pretreated for 1 h with 50 µM amlexanox (AMX) before 1.0 mUI/ml IFNβ
  addition was assessed by qRT-PCR following 6 h (Cxcl10, Ccl2, Il-6) or 24 h (Oasl2).
  Data are Mean ± SEM of three independent experiments. *p ≤ 0.05 vs untreated control
  cells; #p ≤ 0.05 vs IFNβ-treated cells. (I) Molecular routes activated by IFNβ in
  tubular cells. IFNβ activates the canonical TI-IFN pathway leading to ISG expression
  by binding to IFNAR and recruiting TYK2/JAK1/STAT1 signaling (blue pathway). Downstream
  IFNAR or TYK2/JAK1, IFNβ also promotes the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines
  and ISGs by activating the NF-κB (red pathway) and IRF3 (green pathway) transcription
  factors, respectively. Inhibiting TI-IFN signaling at IFNAR (IFNAR-Ab) or TYK2/JAK1
  (PF-06700,841: PF) downmodulates the direct (blue pathway) or indirect (green pathway)
  pathways driving cytokine and IFNα/β gene expression, consistent with crosstalk
  between the TI-IFN and NF-κB pathways (discontinued blue line). Likewise, interfering
  with TBK1/IKKε activation (AMX) decreases both ISG and cytokine gene expression,
  disclosing a second crosstalk between the TBK1/IKKε signaling node and NF-κB. (J-L)
  Murine model of systemic IFNβ injection for evaluation of the renal response. (J)
  Experimental design for IFNβ administration to mice. (K) Time-course of mRNA expression
  of canonical ISGs (Oasl2, Usp18, Ifit1) and chemokines and cytokines (Cxcl10, Ccl2,
  Il-6) in kidneys from control or IFNβ-injected mice. Bar charts represent the Mean
  ± SEM for each gene (n = 5-6 mice/group). *p ≤ 0.05 vs control mice. (L) Immunohistochemical
  analysis and quantification of markers for mononuclear phagocytes (F4/80) (upper
  panel) and lymphocytes (CD3) (lower panel) in kidneys from control and IFNβ-injected
  mice. Representative microphotographs of immune cells in kidney tissue from control
  and IFNβ-injected mice at 24 h. The number of cells per high power field (hpf) was
  quantified and results were expressed as Mean ± SEM. *p ≤ 0.05 vs control untreated
  mice (n = 4-6 mice/group). Original magnification ×200. Scale bar 100 µm.'
