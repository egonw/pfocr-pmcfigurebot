caption: '(A) KEGG pathway analysis of bulk RNA-Seq of control and Vangl1gt/gt; Vangl2−/−
  lungs at 12.5 dpc. Bulk RNA-Seq data were deposited to Gene Expression Omnibus database
  (GSE188993). (B) KEGG pathway analysis of bulk RNA-Seq of control and Wnt5af/f;
  Sox9Cre/+ lungs at 13.5 dpc. Bulk RNA-Seq data were deposited to Gene Expression
  Omnibus database (GSE188993). (C) KEGG pathway analysis of bulk RNA-Seq of control
  and Wnt5af/f; Dermo1Cre/+ lungs at 12.5 dpc. Bulk RNA-Seq data were deposited to
  Gene Expression Omnibus database (GSE188993). (D) KEGG pathway analysis of the proteomes
  of control and Vangl1gt/gt; Vangl2−/− cells. All mass spectrometry data can be found
  in the  and also are publicly available via the UCSD Mass Spectrometry Interactive
  Virtual Environment (MassIVE), a full member of the Proteome Exchange consortium,
  under the dataset number MSV000089851. (E-J) Ventral views of dissected lungs from
  control and Vangl1gt/gt; Vangl2−/− embryos at the developmental stages indicated.
  E-Cad marked epithelial cells. (K) Quantification of FAK and p-FAK signal per cell
  in control and Vangl1gt/gt; Vangl2−/− lungs at 12.5 dpc (mean value ± SEM, unpaired
  Student’s t-test, n = 4 pairs). (L-W) Immunostaining of lung sections collected
  from control and Vangl1gt/gt; Vangl2−/− mice at 12.5 dpc. (X-A’) Immunofluorescence
  of control and Vangl1gt/gt; Vangl2−/− cells. Phalloidin stained F-actin. (B’) Quantification
  of normal and defective p-FAK in control and Vangl1gt/gt; Vangl2−/− cells (mean
  value ± SEM, unpaired Student’s t-test, n = 3 pairs). (C’) Quantification of the
  ratio of p-FAK to FAK in control cells, Vangl1gt/gt; Vangl2−/− cells, and Vangl1gt/gt;
  Vangl2−/− cells expressing VANGL2 or VANGL2 (84A) (mean value ± SEM, one-way ANOVA,
  n = 3 pairs). (*) p < 0.05; (**) p < 0.01; (***) p < 0.001; ns, not significant.
  The underlying data for Fig 3K, 3B’ and 3C’ and the exact P values can be found
  in . (Scale bars: E-J, 0.5 mm; L, O, R, U, 25 μm; M, N, P, Q, S, T, V, W, 5 μm;
  X, Y, 10 μm; Z, A’, 5 μm.) dpc, days post coitus; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; p-FAK,
  phosphorylated FAK.'
