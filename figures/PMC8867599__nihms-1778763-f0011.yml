figure_title: TGP-200c has specific effects on the global MIN6 proteome, traced to
  the selective inhibition of miR-200c biogenesis
caption: (A) Effect of TGP-200c (2 μM) on the proteome of MIN6 cells. Proteins encoded
  by mRNAs that are direct targets of miR-200c, -200b, and -429 (a miR-200 subfamily)
  are highlighted in blue; direct targets of miR-200a and miR-141 are highlighted
  in green. Downstream targets were predicted by TargetScan ().(B) On-target effects
  of TGP-200c observed in global proteomics analysis, grouped by miR-200 subfamilies,
  miR-200c/200b/429- and miR-200a/141-regulated proteins. The difference in their
  downstream targets arises from the single nucleotide difference in their seed regions
  (U/C in the third position).(C) Pathway analysis of 128 proteins predicted to be
  regulated by miR-200c/-200b/-429, conducted using STRING analysis (www.string-db.org).
  Several pathways are selectively modulated by TGP-200, including insulin signaling
  (red), macromolecule metabolism (pink), general cellular metabolism (green), and
  negative regulation of cell death (purple) with false discovery rates of 0.025,
  2.3 × 10−8, 0.004, and 0.0009, respectively.
