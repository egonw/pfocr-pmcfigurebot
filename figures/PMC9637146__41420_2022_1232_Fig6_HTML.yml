figure_title: Synthetic lethality induced by inhibition of LATS2 and SMG6/TERT is
  also observed in a tumor-bearing mouse model
caption: A Timetable for transplantation, drug administration, and IVIS measurements.
  B The IVIS images were obtained after tumor engraft subcutaneous inoculation of
  luciferase induced-Y-MESO-27 cells. One day after Y-MESO-27 transplantation, HPMC
  (n = 5) or BIBR1532 (2 mg/kg, n = 5) were injected in peritoneal cavity twice a
  week. Tumor size was measured by IVIS twice weekly after tumor transplantation until
  day 30. The luminescent intensity indicated the levels of quantification of IVIS
  imaging. p values were calculated using student’s t-test.* indicates p < 0.05 and
  ** indicates p < 0.01.
