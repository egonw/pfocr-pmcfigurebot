caption: 'The effect of histone H3 and H3 antibodies on the expression of the NOD2,
  HDAC6 and NF‐κB signalling pathways and ferroptosis in ALF mice. (A–C) Western blotting
  for NOD2, HDAC6, P65, p‐P65, IκBα and GPX4 protein levels in mice. (D) Quantitative
  real‐time PCR for NOD2, HDAC6 and GPX4 mRNA levels. (E–G) ROS, GSH and Fe2+ levels
  in mice detected by kits. The mouse experiment of Western blotting was repeated
  3 times and the other experiments were repeated 6 times. Compared with the normal
  group, #p < 0.05; compared with the model group, &p < 0.05.'

  induced by extracellular histone H3 in acute liver failure.
