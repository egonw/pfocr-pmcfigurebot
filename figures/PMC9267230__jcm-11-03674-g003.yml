caption: Expression of TUNEL and cleaved caspase 3 in DSS-treated colon samples. (A)
  Representative images of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling
  (TUNEL) staining in the colon of DSS-treated wild-type mice or Ccndbp1-knockout
  mice. Five different sections from each of the 5–6 mice in all groups were quantitatively
  analyzed for the entire colon and for the proximal or distal side of the colon.
  (B) Cleaved caspase 3. Scale bar, 100 µm. The values represent the mean ± standard
  deviation (SD) (n = 6–8 mice per group), * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001,
  **** p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey’s test. Each symbol represents
  the mean data of each mouse.
