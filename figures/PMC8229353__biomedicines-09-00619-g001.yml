caption: 'The WNT/β-catenin pathway and its different actions in gliomas processes.
  When the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway is stimulated, STAT3 signaling pathway
  upregulates the expression and transcriptional activity of β-catenin. In cancers
  STAT3 is a tumor aggressiveness factor. In cancers, the overexpression of EGFR (a
  receptor tyrosine kinase: RTK) stimulates PI3K/Akt pathway. PI3K/Akt signaling leads
  to the phosphorylation of GSK-3β that leads to nuclear translocation and stabilization
  of β-catenin. Similarly, WNT/β-catenin pathway stimulates EGFR in gliomas. Akt signaling
  increases MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity, which induce invasion of cancer cells. Akt signaling
  induces HIF-1a, which stimulates PDK1. Overexpression of WNT/β-catenin also stimulates
  PDK1. PDK1 and c-Myc induce LDH-A, and cytolsolic pyruvate is shunted into lactate
  through activation of LDH-A. Overexpression of MCT-1 exports lactate to extracellular
  space. Lactate production stimulates angiogenesis. c-Myc induced glutaminolysis
  supports mitochondrial integrity and production of aspartate, and results in nucleotide
  biosynthesis. c-Myc and cyclin D stimulate proliferation of gliomas.'
