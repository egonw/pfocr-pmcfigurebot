caption: FLOT2 expression is positively associated with CD109 level in NPC(A) Positive
  correlation between FLOT2 and CD109 expression in NPC tissues of a GEO batch.(B)
  Representative IHC images of FLOT2 and CD109 expression in NPE and NPC samples.
  Scale bar, 100 μm.(C) Kaplan Meier survival analysis for NPC patients based on expression
  levels of CD109.(D) Kaplan Meier survival analysis for NPC patients based on expression
  levels of both FLOT2 and CD109.(E) Mechanism diagram in this study. FLOT2 promotes
  NPC progression by suppressing TGF-β signaling via stimulating the expression of
  CD109 by stabilizing STAT3.

  of TGF-β pathway via facilitating CD109 expression.
