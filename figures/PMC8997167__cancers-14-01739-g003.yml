caption: AR-null and AR-positive LuCaP PDX tumors display distinct signaling network
  topologies. (a) Representative tables of enriched pathways and ontologies highlighted
  by Enrichr analysis with an input of enriched genes that increased by at least 1.5-fold
  comparatively between AR-positive and AR-null CRPC, using the RPPA proteomic data.
  (b) PathwayNet predicted interactions between the enriched genes and other genes,
  and transcription factors are shown in network diagrams for AR-null and AR-positive
  CRPC. (c) GSEA enrichment plots showing upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation,
  c-Myc, and mTOR in AR-positive LuCaP PDX tumors. (d) GSEA enrichment plots showing
  upregulation of E2F targets, EMT, G2M, and H3K27ME3 in AR-null LuCaP PDX tumors.
