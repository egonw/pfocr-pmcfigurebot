figure_title: PNO1 regulates the expression of SLC7A11 via p53
caption: A Cluster analysis of the correlation between PNO1 expression and ferroptosis-related
  proteins. B Western Blotting analysis of ferroptosis-related protein levels in indicated
  Hep3B and HLE cells. C, D The mRNA expression of ferroptosis-related genes was shown
  in indicated Hep3B (C) and HLE (D) cells (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).
  E The relative GSH levels of Hep3B sh-Ctrl and sh-PNO1 cells treated with SLC7A11
  recombinant protein (***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01). F The lipid ROS levels of Hep3B
  sh-Ctrl and sh-PNO1 cells treated with SLC7A11 recombinant protein (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01).
  G Heatmap showing the correlation between expression of PNO1 and p53 pathway-related
  proteins. H GSEA showing the correlation between PNO1 expression and the p53 pathway
  genes. I The protein levels of SLC7A11 transcriptional regulators in indicated Hep3B
  cells. J The protein levels of SLC7A11 in sh-p53 cells.
