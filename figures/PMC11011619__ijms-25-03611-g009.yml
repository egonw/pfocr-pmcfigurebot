caption: Proposed model of this work. The following model is proposed. For the first
  time, we demonstrate that the co-culture of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum activates
  the expression of IL-6 and cell migration. We suggest that the pathway involved
  includes TLR4 because the knockdown of TLR4 blocked this expression. We also observed
  a correlation between NF-kB phosphorylation and nuclear translocation upon infecting
  OKs with the bacterial co-culture, suggesting the participation of NF-kB in this
  process. Moreover, both the co-culture and the monoculture of P. gingivalis regulate
  cell migration through TLR4 signaling (potential connections, as indicated, are
  illustrated with dashed arrows).
