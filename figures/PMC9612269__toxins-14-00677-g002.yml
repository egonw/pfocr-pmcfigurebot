caption: 'I34 inhibited the proliferation of Sf9 cells and arrested cell cycle. (A)
  Sf9 cells treated with I34 before and after light activation showed different inhibitory
  activity. (B) The effect of photoactivated I34 on the activity of Sf9 cells. (C)
  The statistical analysis of (E). (D) The effect of light-activated I34 on the morphology
  in Sf9 cells by inverted microscope. (E) Flow cytometry was performed to observe
  the distribution of the cell cycle to determine the role of I34 in the cell cycle
  of Sf9 cells. Note: I–VI stand for Sf9 cells that were treated with I34 for 3 h,
  6 h, 12 h, 24 h and 48 h, respectively. Columns: different letters indicate a significant
  difference, mean of three experiments, data are presented as mean ± S.D.'
