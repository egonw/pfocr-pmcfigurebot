caption: 'Comparison of disease-related transcriptomic signature among four blood
  CVD datasets. (A) Correlation matrix among four gene expression datasets. Distributions
  located on the diagonal are expression values for all genes. Each point indicates
  a gene Y and X axes are logFC between the two statuses described in the form of
  (A/B). A scatter plot in the xth row and yth column indicates the correlation between
  xth and yth datasets of diagonal datasets. Its correlation coefficient is described
  on the xth column and yth row. (B) Numbers in upper triangle matrix indicate the
  number of common genes between each of the four sets of DEGs between two conditions.
  Their matched p-values measured by hypergeometric test are located in lower triangle
  matrix. (C) Biological pathways were based on hypergeometric test described in Materials
  and Methods. Numbers within rectangles indicate numbers of DEGs or possible DEGs
  in each pathway. Abbreviations: CVD, cardiovascular disease; FC, fold change; PCC,
  Pearson’s correlation coefficient; SCC, Spearman’s correlation coefficient; DEG,
  differentially expressed gene.'
