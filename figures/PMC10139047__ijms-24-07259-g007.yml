caption: An inhibitory analysis of Ca2+ influx into the rat glomerular podocytes.
  (A–C) Shown are averaged fura-2 fluorescence ratio in response to Ca2+ store depletion
  by application of 2 µM Tg for 4 min in glomerular podocytes from control (Ctr, black)
  and diabetic (DM2, red) rats. Left—original traces aligned to the fluorescence ratio
  level before Ca2+ addition; shown are traces recorded in the presence of DMSO or
  indicated inhibitor. Right—difference between Ca2+response in the presence of DMSO
  minus Ca2+response in the presence of indicated inhibitor, the ordinate axis reflects
  the positive and negative contribution of the indicated pathway, estimated by the
  effect of corresponding inhibitor. Inhibitors were applied in 0 mM Ca2+ for 4 min
  together with 2 µM Tg and kept till the end of experiment. 1 µM SAR7334 (panel A),
  5 µM SEA0400 (panel B) and 1 µM CM4620 (panel C) were used. The scale bars shown
  on the left are the same for all panels. Traces shown as Mean ± S.E.M. values.
