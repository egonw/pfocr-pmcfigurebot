caption: 'PTX and PDTC treatment blocked the GPR109A/p38/NF-κB signaling pathway.
  (A,C,E,G), the relative mRNA expression levels of GPR109A, p65, p38, and PPARγ (n
  = 6); (B,D,H), the grayscale analysis of the immunoblot assay of GPR109A, p65, and
  PPARγ (n = 3); (F), the ratio of p-p38 to p38 in AMs from each group (n = 3). Data
  were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. One-way ANOVA was used to analyze
  the differences among groups. * 0.01 < p < 0.05 vs. NG; ** 0.001 < p < 0.01 vs.
  NG; ## 0.001 < p < 0.01 vs. LG + BHB. NG, normal glucose; LG, low glucose.'
