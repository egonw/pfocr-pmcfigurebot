caption: 'The induction of cell apoptosis arrest by ALR and PALR in HMCs. (a) Representative
  images of cell apoptosis. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that ALR (10 mg/ml) and
  PALR (0.1 mg/ml) induced the apoptosis of HMCs, as determined by AnnexinV-PE/7AAD.
  (b) The apoptotic rate of HMCs in each group. All data are depicted as mean ± SD
  (n = 3; ##P < 0.01 versus control group, ∗∗P < 0.01 versus LPS group). (c–j) The
  protein expressions of Bax, cleaved caspase-8/caspase-8, and cleaved caspase-3/caspase-3
  were analyzed using Western blot. HMCs in (c–f) were induced by LPS. However, there
  was non-LPS induction in (g–j). All data are depicted as mean ± SD (n = 3; #P <
  0.05 or ##P < 0.01 versus control group, ∗P < 0.05 or ∗∗P < 0.01 versus LPS group).'
