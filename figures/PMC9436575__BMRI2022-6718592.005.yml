caption: '(a) The level of oxidative stress marker MDA. (b and c) The level of antioxidant
  stress indicator SOD and GSH. (d and e) The expression of the Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway
  maker proteins in ovarian tissues was observed using western blot. (d) The representative
  immunoblots. (e) The expression was quantitated using ImageJ software. (f) Effect
  of electroacupuncture on the expression of the gene in Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling
  pathway in ovarian tissues. (g–i) The level of proinflammatory factor: (g) IL6,
  (h) IL1β, and (i) TNFα. Values are presented as means ± SD (#p < 0.05 and ##p <
  0.01, in comparison to the control group; ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01, in comparison
  to the model group).'
