caption: A model to show the proposed mechanism of decellularised spinal cord matrix
  (DSCM)‐manipulated glial cell niche during DSCM‐driven spinal cord injury (SCI)
  repair process and the defined SCI repairing niche construction. EMT, epithelial‐to‐mesenchymal
  transition; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; NPC, neural progenitor
  cell; SRGN, serglycin.
