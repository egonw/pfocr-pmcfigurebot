figure_title: SARS-CoV-2 spike and receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific B cell responses
  highlight an upregulated extrafollicular response in people living with HIV (PLWH)
caption: The ancestral D614G viral spike (Spike-APC) and receptor binding domain (RBD-PE)
  proteins were used as baits to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific B cells with SA-APC and
  SA-PE used as controls (A). The bait-specific B cells were then overlaid onto an
  IgM vs. IgD plot (B). The extent of IgM-only memory and class switched memory (CSM)
  B cells were compared at both baseline (day 0) and day 84 post diagnosis. (C) Similarly,
  the level of CXCR3 expression was assessed. (D) The extent of double negative (DN)
  B cell activation (CD21- CD95+) was compared regarding HIV status at both time points.
  Statistical analyses were performed using Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney tests. p Values
  are denoted by *â‰¤0.05; **<0.01; ***<0.001, and ****<0.0001.
