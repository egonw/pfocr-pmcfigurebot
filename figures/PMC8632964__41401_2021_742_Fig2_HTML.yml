figure_title: EF suppresses the inflammatory response in LPS-induced ALI mice
caption: a Sections of mouse lung tissue immunostained for MPO content. b Cell pellets
  in BALF were suspended and stained for a marker of neutrophils (Ly-6G) and analyzed
  by FACS. c Total infiltrated cells in BALF were counted by a counting chamber. d
  Statistical analysis of the neutrophil percentage was performed. e Total infiltrated
  neutrophils in BALF were calculated based on the total BALF cell number and percentage
  of neutrophils. f–h TNF-α (f), IL-1β (g), and IL-6 (h) mRNA in the lungs was quantified
  by real-time PCR. i–k TNF-α (i), IL-1β (j), and IL-6 (k) mRNA levels in the lung
  macrophages of LPS-induced ALI mice were quantified by real-time PCR. Values represent
  the mean ± SEM, n = 5 mice each group. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
