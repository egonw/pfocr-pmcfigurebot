figure_title: TTM activates autophagy signaling pathway in HUVECs
caption: A Representative TEM images of TTM-treated HUVECs. Cells were treated with
  100 μM TTM for 12 h. N, nucleus; C, cytoplasm; Mt, mitochondria; Yellow arrow, autophagosomes.
  B Representative immunofluorescence images of LC3B puncta in HUVECs treated with
  30, 100, or 300 μM TTM for 12 h. Scale bar, 20 μm; Zoom-in scale bar, 10 μm. C Western
  blot analysis and quantification of LC3B and SQSTM1 in HUVECs treated with 100 μM
  TTM for 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 h, respectively. β-Actin was used as loading control.
  D Western blot analysis and quantification of LC3B and SQSTM1 in TTM-treated HUVECs
  with or without lysosome inhibitor CQ (5 μM) and BafA1 (100 nM), respectively. GAPDH
  was used as loading control. E Autophagic flux assay using tandem fluorescent-tagged
  LC3B (RFP-GFP-LC3B) construct. Stable cell line expressing RFP-GFP-LC3B was pretreated
  with or without Baf A1 for 1 h and then co-incubated with TTM for 12 h. Scale bar,
  20 μm; Zoom-in scale bar, 10 μm.
