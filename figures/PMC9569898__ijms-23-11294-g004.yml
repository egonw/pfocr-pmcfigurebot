caption: KLB can promote HESC fibrosis and cell proliferation. (A,B) Western blot
  and RT-qPCR analysis of KLB protein and mRNA levels in KLB-overexpressing ESCs.
  (C) Western blot showing that the expression of the fibrosis markers Collagen I
  and FN in the KLB overexpression group was significantly higher than that in the
  control group transfected with the empty plasmid under the same stimulation of TGF-β1.
  (D,E) EdU and CCK8 assays showed that the overexpression of KLB promoted the proliferation
  of HESCs. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p ≤ 0.001; **** p ≤ 0.0001.
