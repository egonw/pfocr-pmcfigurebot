caption: ': Toxicity and virostatic effect of different endocytosis inhibitors. Toxicity
  (shown as cell viability (%), grey) was tested using the CaCo2 cell line and virostatic
  activity (green) was analyzed using the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 lentiviral pseudovirus.
  All compounds were tested at 10 µM. Five different proteins of the endocytosis pathway
  were analyzed. PI3K using Copanlisib, Pictilisib and YM201636; Dynamin using Mdivi1;
  PDE using PDE10-IN-1 and Sildenafil; ß-arrestin using Pirenzepine and Levetimidine;
  Calmodulin using A-7, Zaldaride, Dexniguldipine (also a p-gp efflux pump inhibitor).
  Data shown is based on the average and standard deviation of three independent experiments.'
article_title: High-throughput drug screening allowed identification of entry inhibitors
  specifically targeting different routes of SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron/BA.1.
