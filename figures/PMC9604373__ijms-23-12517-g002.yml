caption: Effects of progestins on the viability of RL95-2 and KLE cells. (A,B) Cells
  were treated with MPA or NOMAc at concentrations of 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 μM for
  48 h, respectively. (C–F) Cells were treated with MPA or NOMAc at a concentration
  of 30 μM and their combination with 10 and 100 nM T3 for 48 h. The results are presented
  as mean ± SEM of wells in triplicate from three independent experiments.
