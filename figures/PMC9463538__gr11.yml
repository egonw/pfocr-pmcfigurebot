caption: Coregulation of Igf1r expression by MAP3K4, CBP, and HDAC6. CBP promotes
  Igf1r expression, and HDAC6 represses Igf1r and Pdpk1 expression. A, shRNA knockdown
  of Crebbp in TSWT cells using 2 independent shRNAs. Crebbp transcript expression
  measured using quantitative PCR (qPCR) in 3 biologically independent experiments.
  B and C, shRNA knockdown of Crebbp in TSWT cells reduces CBP protein expression
  as measured by (B) Western blotting of nuclear lysates and (C) densitometry analyses
  normalized to lamin B1. D, shRNA knockdown of Crebbp results in decreased Igf1r
  transcript expression as measured by qPCR in 3 biologically independent experiments.
  E–G, knockdown of CBP results in decreased expression and phosphorylation of IGF1Rβ.
  F and G, densitometry analyses with normalization as indicated. H–K, knockdown of
  CBP on PDK1, PTEN, and AKT expression and phosphorylation. I, densitometry analyses
  with normalization as indicated. K, densitometry analyses with normalization of
  phosphorylated Akt to Akt1. L, MAP3K4 kinase inactivation in TS cells results in
  increased Hdac6 expression that is reduced by Hdac6 shRNA knockdown (H6sh) in TSKI
  cells. qPCR data show five biologically independent experiments. M, Hdac6 shRNA
  knockdown increases Igf1r transcript expression. qPCR data show 7 biologically independent
  experiments. N, Hdac6 shRNA knockdown increases Pdpk1 transcript expression. qPCR
  data show 3 biologically independent experiments. O–Q, reduction of HDAC6 expression
  in TSKI cells through Hdac6 shRNA knockdown restores IGF1Rβ/IRβ expression and phosphorylation.
  P and Q, densitometry analyses with normalization as indicated. R–U, impact of Hdac6
  shRNA knockdown on PDK1, PTEN, and Akt expression and phosphorylation. S, densitometry
  analyses with normalization of phosphorylated or total protein as indicated. U,
  densitometry analyses with normalization of phosphorylated Akt to Akt1. Data show
  five biologically independent experiments. A, D, L–N, qPCR data normalized to Rps11
  are expressed as a fold change relative to TSWT cells and show the mean ± SD. B,
  E, H, J, O, and R, Western blotting images are representative of 3 biologically
  independent experiments. T, Western blotting images are representative of five biologically
  independent experiments. C, F, G, I, K, P, Q, and S, densitometry was used to quantify
  3 biologically independent experiments. U, densitometry was used to quantify five
  biologically independent experiments. ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗p <
  0.0001; Student’s t test. AKT, protein kinase B; CBP, CREB-binding protein; HDAC6,
  histone deacetylase 6; MAP3K4, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 4;
  ns, not significant; PDK1, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1; PTEN,
  phosphatase and tensin homolog; TS, trophoblast stem.
