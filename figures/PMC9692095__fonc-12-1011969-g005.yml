caption: RNA-seq and Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (GSEA) demonstrating differences
  between early and later canine invasive urothelial carcinoma (InvUC) within each
  molecular subtype. This part of the study was done to search for genes that differed
  in expression between early and later tumors. In the heatmaps (A, B), each column
  represents data from one sample, and the samples are grouped according subtype and
  time of detection (see key). CompareClust was utilized to identify Gene Ontology
  (GO) terms (C) and Hallmark pathways (D) that differed between the early and later
  tumors within each subtype. The gene ratios from the GO and Hallmark pathway analyses
  are indicated by the size of the dot, and the P value is indicated by color scale
  in the key (C, D). Substantial differences were found between early luminal and
  later luminal tumors including GO terms related to proliferation and apoptosis,
  and Hallmark pathways related to proliferation such as PI3K-AKT-mTOR and TP53 pathways.
  In Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, the later luminal tumors also had upregulation of
  Cell Cycle Control of Chromosomal Replication, CDK, EGF, FGFR1, NRAS, and RRAS genes,
  and downregulation of HIPPO signaling and Cell Cycle G1/S Checkpoint Regulation
  (). Differences between the early and later basal tumors were limited, but when
  present included GO terms and Hallmark pathways related to apoptosis, and the immune
  response.
