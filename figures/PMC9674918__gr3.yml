caption: Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) of the overlapping genes (A) Differences
  in biological processes of GO terms scored by GSVA between sepsis patients and controls.
  FC is shown from a linear model. The upper bubble and column chart represent significant
  upregulated biological processes in sepsis patients, and the lower bubble and column
  chart represent significant downregulated biological processes in sepsis patients.
  Top 15–16 pathway activities are shown (B) Differences in Kyoto Encyclopedia of
  Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway scored by GSVA between sepsis patients and controls.
  The upper bubble and column chart, up-regulated KEGG pathway in sepsis patients;
  the lower bubble and column chart, downregulated KEGG pathway in sepsis patients.
  Top 10 signaling pathways are shown. FC, fold change. NS, neonatal sepsis. P value
  <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
