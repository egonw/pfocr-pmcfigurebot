caption: 'Non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient‐derived cancer‐associated fibroblasts
  (CAFs) promote exosome‐mediated proliferation and DDP resistance in NSCLC cells.
  (A) CCK‐8 assessment was implemented to assess cellular proliferation, *p < .05,
  **p < .01, ***p < .001. (B) CCK‐8 assessment was used to calculate DDP IC50 values
  for HCC827 and H1299 cells. **p < .01, ***p < .001 versus control; ##p < .01 versus
  mock‐exosome. The effects of miR‐20a mimic treatment on NSCLC cell proliferation,
  apoptosis and DDP resistance as measured via EdU assay (scale bar, 50 μm) (C), colony
  formation assay (D) and Hoechst staining (E). Results are representative data from
  triplicate experiments, and data are means ± standard deviation (SD)'
article_title: Cancer‐associated fibroblast‐derived exosomal microRNA‐20a suppresses
  the PTEN/PI3K‐AKT pathway to promote the progression and chemoresistance of non‐small
  cell lung cancer.
