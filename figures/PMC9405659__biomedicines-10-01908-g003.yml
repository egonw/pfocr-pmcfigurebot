caption: Cholesterol synthesis is upregulated in ReA cells compared with parental
  cells. (A,B) Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between parental and TS-cultured
  cells, and parental and ReA cells were analyzed by RNA sequencing. DEGs with expression
  levels altered more than two-fold are shown as heatmaps produced using a Multi-Experiment
  Viewer. (C,D) The major signaling pathways among the DEGs were analyzed via ingenuity
  pathway analysis. The pathways with absolute values of z-scores of at least 2 and
  a −log(p-value) of at least 1.3 are shown. IPF—Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis signaling
  pathway; cholesterol biosynthesis II—cholesterol biosynthesis II (via 24,25-dihydrolanosterol);
  cholesterol biosynthesis III—cholesterol biosynthesis III (via desmosterol); role
  of hypercytokinemia—role of hypercytokinemia/hyperchemokinemia in the pathogenesis
  of influenza; role of IL-17F in AIAD—role of IL-17F in allergic inflammatory airway
  diseases. (E) Colorimetric cholesterol assay principle. (F) Lipids in HCC1143 parental
  and ReA cells were extracted, and free cholesterol was measured. Relative levels
  of free cholesterol were represented as the mean ± standard deviation of two independent
  experiments (n = 5). *** p < 0.001 relative to parental cells.
