figure_title: SV decreased DKK1 protein expression in the dentate gyrus of APP mice
caption: Representative confocal scanning images show DKK1 immunopositive material
  in the dentate gyrus of WT and APP mice. The empty white box in the top right panel
  shows the scanning area illustrated in the other panels and used for analysis. Inserts
  at the bottom of each image indicate higher magnification of the same field. Semi-quantitative
  analysis performed in APP mice showed that SV (treatment timeline shown on top of
  bar graph) significantly decreased DKK1 protein expression in the CA1 stratum lacunosum-moleculare
  area compared to untreated APP. Scale bar = 45 µm. *p < 0.05, using Student’s t
  test.
