caption: M2-MDEs promote the migration and invasion of meningioma cells. (a) The wound
  healing assay was used to examine the mobility of IOMM-Lee and CH157-MN cells. Scale
  bars 200 μm. (b) The migration and invasion ability of IOMM-Lee and CH157-MN cells
  was assessed using Transwell chambers, and the number of cells passing through the
  upper chamber membrane was counted. Scale bars 100 μm. (c) Protein expression levels
  of slug, snail, vimentin, and N-cadherin were detected by western blotting. ∗p <
  0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, vs. the control and M0-MDE group.
