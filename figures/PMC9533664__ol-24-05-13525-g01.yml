caption: Effect of Con A on the migration of human liver cancer cells and hepatocytes.
  (A) Cell migration of HCCLM3, MHCC97L, HepG2 and MIHA cells after treatment with
  Con A (0, 1, 3, 5 and 10 µg/ml) for 6 h. Microscopic imaging of four cell types
  in a Transwell chamber (scale bar, 100 nm). The quantification of (B) HCCLM3, (C)
  MHCC97L, (D) HepG2 and (E) MIHA cells in the Transwell chamber was calculated manually
  by counting the number of cells. The data were expressed as the mean ± SD (n=3).
  *P<0.05 and **P<0.01 vs. the control group. Con A, concanavalin A.
article_title: Concanavalin A inhibits human liver cancer cell migration by regulating
  F-actin redistribution and assembly via MAPK signaling pathway.
