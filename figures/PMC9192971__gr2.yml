caption: 'Effects of trans-anethole on the relative mRNA expression of genes related
  to inflammation in the liver of LPS-challenged broilers. The values are represented
  as mean (n = 8) with their standard errors. Bars with unlike letters means significantly
  different. Abbreviations: IL-6, interleukin-6; IL-8, interleukin-8; IL-10, interleukin-10;
  NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa B; IκBα, inhibitor of NF-κB alpha; TNF-α, Tumor necrosis
  factor-α; TLR4, Toll-like receptor 4; IFN-γ, Interferon-γ. CON, control group fed
  with basal diet and treated with saline; LPS, group fed with basal diet and treated
  with lipopolysaccharide; LPS+TA400, group fed with 400 mg/kg trans-anethole and
  treated with lipopolysaccharide; LPS+TA600, group fed with 600 mg/kg trans-anethole
  and treated with lipopolysaccharide.'
