figure_title: MG53 exerted its anti-tumor effect by inhibiting RAC1-MAPK axis in HCC
caption: A–D SNU387 cells were co-transfected with Si-MG53 and Si-RAC1. 48 h after
  the transfection, cells were collected for the detection of RAC1 by western blot
  (A). CCK-8 assay was performed to detect the cell proliferation of these transfected
  cells at 48 h (B). Transwell assay was performed to detect the invasion of these
  transfected HCC cells (C). Colony formation assay was performed to detect the proliferation
  of these transfected HCC cells (D). E HUH7 cells were co-transfected with Myc-MG53
  plasmid and Flag-RAC1 plasmid. Transwell assay was performed to detect the invasion
  of these transfected HCC cells. F HCC cells were transfected with two SiRNA sequences
  against MG53 or its mock control. 48 h after the transfection, western blot was
  performed to detect the levels of p-P38, p-JNK and p-ERK. G HCC cells were transfected
  with Myc-MG53 plasmid or its mock control, and western blot assay was performed
  to detect the levels of p-P38, p-JNK and p-ERK. H–J HUH7 cells were transfected
  with Si-MG53 to knockdown the expression of MG53, and U0126 (1 μM) was added to
  inhibit the activation of MAPK signaling pathway. CCK-8 assay was performed to detect
  the proliferation of these HCC cells at 0 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h (H). Transwell
  assay was performed to detect the invasion of these transfected HCC cells (I). Colony
  formation assay was performed to detect the proliferation of these transfected HCC
  cells (J). K HUH7 cells were co-transfected with Myc-MG53 plasmid and Flag-RAC1
  plasmid and further cultured for 24 h before western blot was performed to detect
  the expression level of p-P38, p-JNK and p-ERK. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001
  for statistical analysis of the indicated groups. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001
  for statistical analysis of the indicated groups.
