caption: Relative expression of lipid metabolism‐related genes in barrier‐damaged
  HaCaT cells after repair by Cer/GlcCer. (A) Effect of Cer on the SREBP‐1c pathway.
  (B) Effect of GlcCer on the SREBP‐1c pathway. (C) Effect of Cer on the PPAR pathway.
  (D) Effect of GlcCer on the PPAR pathway. Cer, ceramide; GlcCer, glucosylceramide;
  PPAR, peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor; SDS, sodium dodecyl sulfate; SREBP,
  sterol regulatory element‐binding protein. **p < 0.01 and *p < 0.05.
