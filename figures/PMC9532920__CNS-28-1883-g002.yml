caption: Apigenin inhibits TGFβ/SMADs signaling. (A) Expression of phosphorylated‐SMAD2/3
  and SMAD2/3 proteins detected by Western blotting and quantitative analysis. (B)
  Expression of SMAD2/3 in NIH‐3 T3 cells detected by immunofluorescence (Scale bar = 50 μm).
  (C) Expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and ERK1/2 proteins detected by Western
  blotting. (D) Expression of phosphorylated AKT and AKT proteins detected by Western
  blotting. (E) Expression of SMAD4 and SMAD7 proteins detected by Western blotting.
  (F) qRT‐PCR was used to detect the expression of Actα2, Col1α1, and Fn in NIH‐3 T3
  cells treated with apigenin or SIS3, with or without TGFβ for 24 h. (G) Schematic
  representation of apigenin‐alleviating fibrous scar formation after spinal cord
  injury by inhibiting TGFβ/SMADs signaling. (ns means p > 0.05; ** means p < 0.01;
  *** means p < 0.001; **** means p < 0.0001, p values were calculated with one‐way
  anova, followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. n = 3)
