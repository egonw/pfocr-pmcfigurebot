caption: Model for sHSP chaperone activity. (i) sHSP dimers and monomers continuously
  alternate between being bound in an oligomer or released into the environment. (ii)
  Misfolded and unfolded proteins expose hydrophobic regions to which sHSPs bind using
  a hydrophobic groove in the ACD, forming large substrate-sHSP complexes (iii). (iv)
  The denatured substrate can be refolded by Hsp70, ATP, and a co-chaperone which
  displace the sHSP-substrate complex and attach to the substrate. (v) Lack of adequate
  sHSPs can result in the formation of protein aggregates, which are harder to eliminate.
  (vi) Cellular proteases can also degrade the substrate from an sHSP-substrate complex,
  but this pathway is less well-known. This model does not elucidate all possible
  sHSP proteins actions (reproduced with the permission of the publisher, from Basha
  et al., 2012, mod.) .
