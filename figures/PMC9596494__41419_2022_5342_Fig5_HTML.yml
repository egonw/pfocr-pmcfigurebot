figure_title: Cell proliferation and migration in Nthy-ori 3.1 and TPC1 cells with
  PER2 ablation
caption: A Immunoblot analysis in Nthy-ori 3.1 and TPC1 cells transfected with siPER2
  or negative control siRNA confirms protein levels for the MAPK pathway and PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathways. ERK1/2 and JNK MAPK phosphorylation is increased in Nthy-ori
  3.1 and TCP1 cells transfected with siPER2 relative to the corresponding negative
  control siRNA. Phosphorylation of AKT and p70S6 kinase in the PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathway is upregulated in Nthy-ori 3.1 and TPC1 cells transfected with siPER2 relative
  to the corresponding negative control siRNA. The AP-1 transcription factor c-Fos
  is upregulated in Nthy-ori 3.1 and TPC1 cells transfected with siPER2 relative to
  the corresponding negative control siRNA. No significant difference is detected
  for c-Jun. GAPDH is used as a loading control. The result of each densitometry analysis
  is shown below each band and was normalized to the corresponding GAPDH level. B
  Analysis of cell viability and proliferation by MTT assay in control and siPER2-transfected
  cells. Results represent means ± SEM from six independent experiments. p-values
  are obtained by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test. C Cell proliferation, indicated
  by Ki-67 immunoexpression, is higher in the thyroids of 30-month-old mice with weak
  PER2 expression (Ki-67 index = 16.12 ± 6.62%) than in that of the thyroids of 6-week-old
  mice (Ki-67 index = 7.62 ± 4.0%, p = 0.004). Scale bar, 100 μm. **p < 0.01. D Time-lapse
  microscopy images of wound closure in control and PER2 siRNA-transfected Nthy-ori
  3.1 and TPC1 cells at 0 and 24 h. The lines define the area lacking cells. Quantification
  of the wounded width invaded over 24 h by control and PER2 siRNA-transfected Nthy-ori
  3.1 or TPC1 presents as the average distance. Results represent the mean of wound
  width obtained in two independent experiments consisting of three subsets. n.s,
  non-significant; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.
