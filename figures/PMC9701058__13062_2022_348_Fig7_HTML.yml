caption: CXCL1 cannot exert its effects through autocrine manner in colon cancer.
  a Results of bioinformatics analysis showing a positive correlation between CXCL1
  and the expression of CXCR2. b The protein expression of CXCL1 in the supernatant
  derived from each group of cells (MC38 WT, MC38CXCL1−/−, MC38CXCL1+/+) was assessed
  by ELISA assay. c The CXCR2 protein expression profile in the HPA database. d Immunohistochemistry
  assay analyzed the expression of CXCR2 in mouse colon cancer tissues. *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01
article_title: CXCL1 promotes colon cancer progression through activation of NF-κB/P300
  signaling pathway.
