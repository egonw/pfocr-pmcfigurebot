caption: Platelet aggregation and shape change are defective in PT-VWD. (A) Human
  platelet aggregation in response to TRAP-6 20 mM (i), ADP 10 mM (ii) and collagen
  1 mg/mL (iii) in platelet-rich plasma from the PT-VWD patient and a parallel healthy
  control. Traces are representative of four independent experiments (Online Supplementary
  Table S1, samples A, C, D, E). *=P<0.05 vs. control, unpaired Student’s t test.
  (B) Platelet shape change assessed by LTA after pretreatment with RGDS (120 mg/mL)
  in response to TRAP-6 2 mM (i), ADP 10 mM (ii) and collagen 1 mg/mL (iii) in platelet-rich
  plasma from the PT-VWD patient and a parallel healthy control. Tracings are representative
  of four independent experiments (Online Supplementary Table S1, samples A, C, D,
  E) *P<0.05 vs. control, unpaired Student’s t test.
