figure_title: RGD/integrin and HAVDI/N-cadherin ligations regulate the adhesive state
  and the cytoskeletal organization of hMSCs
caption: 'a Left: Representative paxillin images in hMSCs on “OFF”, “ON” and “Dual
  ON” substrates for 1 d. Zoomed regions correspond to the rectangles marked in white
  in the main images. Right: Corresponding quantification of paxillin adhesion length
  (from left to right n = 146, 173, 154 adhesions in 41, 47, 45 cells respectively).
  b Left: Representative heat maps of traction stress in hMSCs on “OFF”, “ON” and
  “Dual ON” substrates for 1 d. Right: Corresponding quantification of average traction
  stress per cell (from left to right n = 37, 44, 47 cells). c Left: Representative
  F-actin images in hMSCs on “OFF”, “ON” and “Dual ON” substrates for 1 d (top). Zoomed
  regions display details of F-actin organization in the apical region of the nucleus
  (middle). The cross-sectional side view of lamin A/C staining was captured along
  the XZ-plane crossing the center of the nucleus (bottom). Right: Corresponding quantification
  of the percentages of hMSCs having the actin cap (top) (n = 3 experiments per group).
  Corresponding quantification of nuclear height (bottom) (from left to right n =
  43, 55, 48 cells). d Schematic of a possible pathway for YAP nuclear translocation
  in response to the RGD/integrin and HAVDI/N-cadherin ligations. RGD on “ON” substrates
  induced integrin clustering and promoted formation of focal adhesions (FA) and actin
  cap. Contractile force from actin cap compressed and flattened the nucleus, and
  may have thereby enabled nuclear localization of YAP. HAVDI on “Dual ON” substrates
  reduced integrin clustering and FA formation, possibly attenuating nuclear compression
  and nuclear localization of YAP. Data are presented as mean ± s.e.m., and p values
  were obtained using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test (a–c). Scale
  bars: 20 µm (a), 30 µm (b), 30 µm for F-actin images and 5 µm for lamin A/C images
  (c). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.'
