caption: S1pr2 is expressed in vascular endothelial cells and down-regulated after
  HLI. A, S1pr2 expression in endothelial cells (ECs) of gastrocnemius muscles after
  HLI operation (n = 5). B, Relative mRNA expression levels of S1pr1 and S1pr3 in
  endothelial cells of gastrocnemius muscles obtained from mice after sham or HLI
  operation (n = 3). C, Generation of EC-specific S1pr2 loss-of-function mice. D,
  Relative mRNA expression levels of S1pr2 in ECs of WT and S1pr2ECKO mice (n = 4).
  E and F, Western blotting analysis of S1pr2 protein levels in ECs from S1pr2ECKO
  mice or WT control mice, with their quantification (n = 3). Data are mean Â± SEM.
  n.s indicates not significant. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01.
