caption: '3-MST inhibition suppresses CyR61 mRNA levels through the inhibition of
  S1PR via ATF1 and CREB (p38MAPK pathway). A: Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis
  of endogenous mRNA levels of CyR61, S1PR2 and ATF1 in HCT116 cells after incubation
  with HMPSNE, AOAA or their combination for 48 h. Data are shown as mean ± SEM of
  at least 4 independent experiments, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 compared to control. B,C:
  Western blot analysis of S1PR2 and p38MAPK pathway markers in presence of HMPSNE,
  AOAA or their combination for 48 h. Data are shown as mean ± SEM, n = 4, **p<0.01
  compared to control.'
