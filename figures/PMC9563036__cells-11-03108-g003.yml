caption: 'Postulated mechanisms of PC-EVs in the BBB. In response to PDGF-BB, PC-EVs
  release VEGF to recipient endothelial cells (ECs). VEGF-A inhibits the expression
  of tight junction proteins such as Ocln and Cln5 through an eNOS signaling pathway,
  inducing vascular leakage. EVs contain various miRNAs that regulate BBB integrity
  when transferred to ECs. Among them, miR7b acts by targeting SEMA6A/D, enhancing
  endothelial barrier function. Hypoxia-induced PC-EV release increases Ocln and Cln5
  protein expression by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway. The exact cargo of the PC-EVs
  has not been reported. Ang-1 released by PC-EVs act on the Tie-2 receptor and promote
  barrier function by enhancing Ocln gene expression. Ang-1/Tie2 targets the PI3/Akt
  signaling pathway to promote the expression of cellular junction protein (VE-cadherin),
  thereby strengthening the cellular architecture. LPS-induced secretion of inflammatory
  mediators (MMP9, chemokine) and adhesion molecules (ICAM, VCAM) from PCs may promote
  vascular leakage. PC-EV content released by stimulation with LPS has not yet been
  reported. The black arrow indicates identified components and mechanism of action
  of PC-EVs, and the magenta arrow indicates hypothesized Mechanism in PC-EVs based
  on identified mechanisms from other EVs. The blue arrow indicates the speculative
  mechanism (miRNA: an acronym for micro RNA; PCs: pericyte; EVs: extracellular vesicles;
  VEGF: Vascular endothelial growth factor; PI3K: phosphoinositide 3-kinase; Ocln:
  Occludin; Cln5: Claudin-5; ICAM: intercellular adhesion molecule 1; VCAM: Vascular
  cell adhesion 1; MMPs: matrix metalloproteinases; Ang-1: angiopoietin-1; BBB: Blood–brain
  barrier). “?” indicates the content of the PC-EVs is not identified.'
