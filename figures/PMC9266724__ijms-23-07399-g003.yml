caption: 'KEGG analysis of DEmRNA in 15-month-age DKO mice. (A) KEGG pathway analysis
  of mRNAs. (B) The net plot of KEGG pathways shows the enrichment of DEmRNAs in different
  pathways. Color dots represent the fold change of gene expression in different pathways.
  The y-axis represents the gene count. The x-axis gives the enrichment analysis terms.
  Plot colors represent the p-values and sizes represent the gene numbers. (Câ€“E) Heatmap
  for DEmRNAs enriched in steroid hormone biosynthesis, cortisol synthesis and secretion,
  as well as aldosterone synthesis and secretion. Blue: DKO mice; Red: WT mice.'
