caption: ERR⍺ is involved in PF739‐mediated induction of angiogenic genes. (A) Representative
  Western blots showing the effect of XCT 790 (XCT) (1 μM) on baseline and PF739 (2.5 μM)
  induced ERRα expression in C2C12 myotubes (N = 6). Beta‐actin is used as the loading
  control (N = 6). Densitometric quantification is shown in the lower panel. (B) mRNA
  expression of angiogenic genes (Egf and Vegfb) in PF739 (2.5 μM) and XCT 790 (1 μM)
  treated C2C12 myotubes. (C) Scheme summarizing that AMPK/ERRα angiogenic signaling
  pathway is suppressed in the skeletal muscle in DIO, and forced ERRα activation
  in the skeletal muscle promotes recovery after HLI in DIO mice. One‐way ANOVA followed
  by Tukey's post hoc test p < 0.01 = ** and p < 0.001 = ***.
