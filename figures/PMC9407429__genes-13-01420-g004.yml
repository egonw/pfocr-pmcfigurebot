caption: Workflow and miRNA expression profile of ATII cells. Lung single-cell suspensions
  were generated from unchallenged female C57BL/6NCrl mice. ATII cells were isolated
  either by negative selection (panning, pATII, n = 2) or by cell sorting (sATII,
  n = 2). Both cell preparations were subjected to miRNA profiling using TaqMan® array
  microfluidic cards (Life Technologies). In pATII and sATII, respectively, 61 and
  121 miRNAs had fold differences larger than 1.5 (FC > 1.5). A cut set of 111 miRNAs
  with similar expression levels (|fold difference| ≤1.5) in pATII and sATII was identified
  and is represented as a bar diagram. For 40 of these bona fide ATII miRNAs, experimentally
  observed interactions with 662 mRNA targets were available in the Ingenuity® database
  and this information was used for pathway enrichment analysis, resulting in 38 miRNAs
  targeting 343 mRNAs in 145 pathways. Black bars indicate 19 miRNA targeting components
  of the TGF-β signaling pathway. The majority (16 out of 19) of these miRNAs were
  expressed above median level. A complete list of the miRNAs expressed in ATII cells
  is available as a spreadsheet file (see ). n = 2 represents a biological replicate.
