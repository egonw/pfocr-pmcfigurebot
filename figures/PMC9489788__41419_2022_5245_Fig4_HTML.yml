figure_title: Circ_0003215 serves as an efficient miR-663b sponge in CRC
caption: 'A Correlation analysis between the expression levels of circ_0003215 and
  linear MYO9B using Pearsons correlation coefficient. B Circ_0003215 was detected
  by RIP assay and agarose gel electrophoresis. C The potential target miRNAs of circ_
  0003215 predicted by the circBank tools. D The correlation matrix of circ_ 0003215
  and predicated miRNAs levels measured by RT-qPCR in 10 CRC patients. (Red: positive
  correlation; Blue: negative correlation; circle size and color intensity are proportional
  to correlation coefficients.) E Whole-cell lysates from CRC cells were incubated
  with biotin-circ_0003215 or NC probe based on the RNA pull-down flow diagram(left),
  and the enrichment levels of circ_0003215 and predicated miRNAs were analyzed by
  RT-qPCR in SW480 cells(right). F The heatmap of miRNA sequencing data of 21 pairs
  of CRC tissues (GSE89143). G FISH asssay showed the colocalization between circ_0003215
  and miR-663b in SW480 and HT29 cells. H The structure and the sequence of circ_0003215-WT
  or circ_0003215- MUT luciferase plasmid(left). The relative luciferase activities
  of HEK-293T co-transfected with miR-663b mimics and circ_0003215-WT compared to
  circ_0003215-MUT (right). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.'
