caption: 'p67phox-induced chondrocyte differentiation was dependent on PI3K/AKT/SOX9
  pathways. a) The chondrocytes were transiently transfected with various doses of
  p67phox plasmid (pcDNA-p67phox) or control (pcDNA3.1), and then the expression of
  p67phox and SOX9 protein was measured by western blot analysis. b) and c) The chondrocytes
  were transiently transfected with various doses of p67phox plasmid (pcDNA-p67phox)
  or control (pcDNA3.1). p67phox-overexpressed cells were pretreated with either 5
  or 10 Î¼mol/l of LY294002 for three hours, and then the protein and messenger RNA
  (mRNA) expression of SOX9 was measured by western blot and real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase
  chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. ###p < 0.001 compared with transfected pcDNA alone;
  ***p < 0.001 compared with untreated control. AKT, protein kinase B; PI3K, phosphoinositide
  3-kinase; SOX9, SRY-box transcription factor 9.'
