caption: 'Activation of oxidative stress pathways in pyroptotic BMDMs was associated
  with poor prognosis. (a) BMDM and microglia identified in the GSE131928, GSE117891
  and GSE117891 datasets were extracted and integrated using the harmony R package.
  (b) tSNE plots show the distribution of BMDMs and microglia in glioma samples of
  different disease grades after correction for batch effects. The pie charts show
  the percentage of BMDMs and microglia in each WHO grade of sample. (c) Comparison
  of CASP1, CASP4, GSDMD, and NLRC4 expression in BMDMs (left) and microglia (right)
  from samples of different WHO grades. (d) CASP1+ GSDMD+ and CASP4+ GSDMD+ cells
  were defined as pyroptotic cells, and the pyroptosis type of the cells was projected
  in the tSNE plot. The pie charts show the percentage of BMDMs and microglia in each
  WHO grade of sample. The pie chart shows the percentage of pyroptotic cells in BMDMs
  and microglia. (e, f) Trajectory of all BMDMs along pseudotime. The colors from
  blue to red represent the forward order of pseudotime. The pyroptosis type of the
  cells is projected on the trajectory. (g) Heatmap revealing the dynamic changes
  in gene expression during the differentiation process. From the middle to the left
  and to the right represent the process of changes in gene expression toward differentiation
  to the two cell fates. Differences in enriched pathways by GO between different
  phases (right panel). Genes were grouped into four clusters according to their expression
  patterns, and the results of GO enrichment analysis for each gene cluster are presented
  in different colors and shown below. (h, i) ssGSEA in TCGA cohort based on the LPS/bacterial
  response pathway and oxidative stress response pathway genes in Gene Cluster 1,
  comparing their differences between the high- and low-risk groups and their impact
  on overall survival. Statistics were calculated using the Wilcoxon test in (c).
  Statistics were calculated using two-tailed, unpaired Student''s t-test with Welch''s
  correction in (h). ns: not significant. ∗∗p < 0.01,  ∗∗∗p < 0.001, and∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.'
