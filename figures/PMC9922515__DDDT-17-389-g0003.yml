caption: The impact of solanine on cell proliferation in vitro. (A and B) MTT assays
  to measure the cell viability of SGC-7901 cells treated with different concentrations
  of solanine (μM, n=5). (C and D) EdU assays to determine cell proliferative ability
  in SGC-7901 cells (n=3). (E) Cell colony formation assays to examine the proliferation
  of SGC-7901 cells (n=3). Data are expressed as the mean ± SD.
