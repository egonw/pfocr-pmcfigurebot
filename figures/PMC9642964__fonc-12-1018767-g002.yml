caption: Differential expression of global immune response genes under reovirus infection
  in CRC cell lines categorized on MMR status. (A) Hierarchical-clustering profile
  across differentially expressed genes (DEGs) participating in immune pathways upon
  treatment with reovirus in MSI and MSS groups. RMA normalized expression values
  for the 86 genes were used to generate a heat-map in the TAC software. The colors
  indicate the expression value relative to the median expression value per gene in
  the dataset. Red indicates upregulation relative to median value and green indicates
  downregulation relative to the median value. (B) GO term enrichment and KEGG pathway
  analyses of DEGs using DAVID. Differentially expressed probes between MSI and MSS
  cell lines treated with reovirus were selected based on meeting the criteria of
  p ≤ 0.05 and divided into positive and negative fold changes lists and used to determine
  enrichment. (C) Protein interaction analysis using STRING. The different colored
  nodes represent different genes. Different edges (lines) show the interplay between
  genes. Edge strength is shown by thickness of the line, the thicker the line, the
  stronger the interaction. Hub networks made using MCODE demonstrate the genes within
  the PPI that were screened to display the most highly upregulated. The genes not
  included in the hub networks did not have substantial interaction amongst the other
  genes in the list, therefore they were not included. (D) Venn diagram created using
  the TAC software. It illustrates the clear point that between the MMR subgroups,
  CREB1 gene is the only commonality out of 25 genes, 16 in the MSI and 9 genes in
  the MSS groups.
