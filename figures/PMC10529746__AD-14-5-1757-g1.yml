caption: 'Expression of RACGAP1 was increased in NEPC and was related to the progression
  and prognosis of prostate cancer. (A) Venn diagram showing that three highly expressed
  genes were screened from four NEPC-related public databases. (B) Heatmap showing
  the mRNA expression of RACGAP1 and NED markers in NEPC (n=15) and CRPC tumor tissues
  (n=34) of prostate in Beltran, 2016 (n=49) database. (C, D) Other visual analyses
  of multiple databases showed that the mRNA expression of RACGAP1 in NEPC was significantly
  higher than that in other types of prostate cancer and was positively correlated
  with NED markers (adenocarcinoma pre-castration day 0; post-castration days 1-3;
  weeks 1-3, 8, and 12; and post-NEPC development relapsed and LTL331R. Data were
  downloaded from GSE59986). (E) High expression of RACGAP1 in NEPC (n=15) was enriched
  in the RB1 signaling pathway. (F, G) Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that poor prognosis
  with high RACGAP1 of recurrence-free survival (RFS) of data in the TCGA-PRAD (n=437)
  and Taylor databases (n=140). (H-J) mRNA levels of RACGAP1 in prostate cancer in
  the TCGA-PRAD database were related to different clinicopathological parameters:
  pathological T stage (n=490), pathological N stage (n=424), and Gleason score (n=497).
