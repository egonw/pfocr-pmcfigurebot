caption: 'Transcriptome analysis of DEGs in the N and C treatments of foxtail millet.
  DEGs in the N and C treatments (A). Volcano plot showing DEGs in the N and C treatments
  of foxtail millet (B). Heat maps representing DEGs expression profiles after freezing
  treatment (C). To determine the significance of DEGs, a threshold of q < 0.05 was
  used. The grey points represent transcripts that were not significantly changed
  in the N library in comparison with the C library. N: normal; C: frozen.'
