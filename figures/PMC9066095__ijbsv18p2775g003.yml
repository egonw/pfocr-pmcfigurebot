caption: M2 macrophage polarization related pathways. IL-4 activates Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway in macrophages, resulting in up-regulation of c-Myc expression.
  C-Myc can promote M2 polarization. Long non-coding RNA LINC00662 up-regulated the
  expression of Wnt-3a by binding to miR-15a/16/107, activated Wnt/β-catenin signal,
  and promoted the proliferation and growth of liver cancer cells in vivo. Meanwhile,
  WNT3a induces M2 macrophage polarization by paracrine. Created with BioRender.com.
