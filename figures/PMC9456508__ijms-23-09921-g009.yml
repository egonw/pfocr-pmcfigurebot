caption: Effects of exercise on the PLC/Kcnip3/Mid1/PP2A signaling pathway in the
  brains of AD mice. The relative expression levels of the (A) Plcg1, (B) Plcg2, (C)
  Kcnip3, (D) Mid1, and (E) Ppp2cα mRNA in mouse brain tissue were measured by RT-PCR
  (n = 5). Data are presented as means ± SDs. * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 vs. AP +
  SED mice.
