caption: Reticulocalbin3 (RCN3) regulated MMP‐2 and MMP‐9 expression through inositol
  1,4,5‐trisphosphate receptor 1 (IP3R1)–Ca2+–calcium/calmodulin‐dependent protein
  kinase (CaMKII). (A) In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cell lines, RCN3
  is positively correlated with IP3R1 expression. *p < 0.05, Pearson's correlation
  coefficient. (B) Co‐IP analysis showed that RCN3 interacted with IP3R1. (C) Immunofluorescence
  staining showed there the expression and localization of RCN3 and IP3R1 in ECA109
  cells. (D–G) Fluo‐4 AM showed intracellular Ca2+ concentration. (H) Western blot
  analysis the expression of related proteins of the IP3R1–Ca2+–CaMKII–c‐Jun signaling
  pathway. (I) Expression of MMP‐2 and MMP‐9 inhibited by IP3R–Ca2+–CaMKII blockers
  in OV‐RCN3 ESCC cells. (J) Invasion ability of OV‐RCN3 ESCC cell inhibited by IP3R–Ca2+–CaMKII
  blockers. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, t‐test. NC, negative control
