caption: 'Induction of cell-protective autophagy in MC-3 oral cancer cells upon PL
  treatment. (A) The MC-3 and HSC-4 oral cancer cells were pretreated with 3-MA (2
  mM) and HCQ (20 μM) for 2 h, followed by treatment with PL (0 and 8 μM) for 24 h.
  The cell viability was measure by MTT assay. (B) Protein levels of PARP, Bax, Bcl-2,
  LC3 were measured by Western blotting. β-actin was used as loading control. The
  results are representative of three independent experiments (statistically significant
  differences, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 vs. the control group; #p < 0.05 vs. the PL
  treatment group).'
