caption: ATRA regulated the differentiation of adipocytes from Yanbian yellow cattle
  through the mTOR signaling pathway. (a) The expression levels of AKT2, SREBP1, ACC,
  and FAS mRNA were evaluated by qRT-PCR after treatment with different concentrations
  of ATRA. (b) The expression levels of SREBP1 and AKT2 proteins in bovine adipocytes
  treated with ATRA. Different lowercase letters in the figure indicate significant
  differences compared with the control group, p < 0.05. Different capital letters
  indicate highly significant differences compared with the control group, p < 0.01.
  Full Western Blot  and  are provided in the .
