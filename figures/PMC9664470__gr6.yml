caption: 'Met inhibitor in combination with the EGFR inhibitor showed a remarkable
  effect in suppressing pancreatic cancer growth in vivo. a, The tumor pancreatic
  orthotopic formation assay in BALB/c mouse model. PANC-1 Luciferase (Luc) cells
  (control group, n = 6) or PANC-1 Luc mixed with PSC (co-injection group, n = 6)
  were implanted into the pancreata of each immunodeficient mouse. b, The tumor volume
  curves of indicated group were monitored by bioluminescence image analysis. c, Tumor
  volumes were assessed in orthotopically implanted mice on the eighth week after
  all mice were euthanized. d, Representative bioluminescence images of indicated
  groups. e, Tumor weight were assessed in orthotopically implanted mice on the eight
  week after all mice were euthanized. f, Schematic diagram of how PSC-derived HGF
  suppresses the sensitivity of EGFR inhibitor in pancreatic cancer. Left: Hypoxia
  promotes the transcriptional activation of HGF gene expression by HIF-1α in the pancreatic
  stellate cell, then the overexpressed HGF contributed to the resistance of pancreatic
  cancer cells to EGFR inhibitor through re-activating the PI3K-AKT pathway. Right:
  Met inhibitor inhibited HGF mediated downstream signaling and increased the sensitivity
  of pancreatic cancer cells to EGFR inhibitor. ns: not significant, ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01.'
