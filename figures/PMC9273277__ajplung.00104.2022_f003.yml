caption: 'Five hypoxia-associated cell types appeared in response to hypoxia at D1
  and three at D7. A: heatmap: top five most overexpressed transcripts in each subgroup
  at D1. B: grouped UMAP plot depicting groups at D1. C: G4 pathways analyses heatmaps.
  Ci: functions. Cii: canonical pathways. Ciii: upstream regulators. D: top five most
  overexpressed transcripts in each subgroup at D7. E: cell trajectories and transcripts
  that vary according to the sequence of cellular states implicated in PH development.
  Dark blue = the beginning of the trajectory. Light blue = end of the trajectory.
  Red arrows = direction of the trajectory. F: pathways associated with transcripts
  that vary according to the sequence of cellular states. G: grouped UMAP plot depicting
  groups at D7. H: G9 pathway analyses heatmaps. Key for heatmaps: Ci and Hi: functions.
  Cii and Hii: canonical pathways. Ciii and Hiii: upstream regulators. Gray dots =
  not applicable. PH, pulmonary hypertension; UMAP, uniform manifold approximation
  and projection.'
