figure_title: Differential metabolic requirement for CD27+ and CD27− γδ T cells
caption: (A) The mRNA expression levels of Glut1 in polarized CD27+ and CD27− γδ T
  cells by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). (B) 2-NBDG uptake in polarized
  CD27+ and CD27− γδ T cells assessed by flow cytometry. Representative histogram
  and summarized mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) data are shown. (C) The mRNA expression
  levels of GLS and GLUD1 in polarized CD27+ and CD27− γδ T cells. (D) Differential
  abundance of metabolites detected by SIRM in polarized CD27− (n = 5) and CD27+ (n
  = 6) γδ T cells. (E) MitoGREEN/MitoRED (top) and MitoGREEN/MitoSOX (bottom) staining
  of polarized CD27− and CD27+ γδ T cells. Representative dot plots are shown. (F)
  Cell size [forward scatter (FSC)] from polarized CD27− and CD27+ γδ T (top) and
  MitoSOX staining from polarized CD27− and CD27+ γδ T (bottom). Summarized data of
  mitochondrial ROS from polarized CD27− and CD27+ γδ T are shown (right). Data are
  represented as means ± SEM. **P < 0.01. Data (A to C and E to F) are representative
  of at least three independent experiments with similar results. AMP, adenosine 5′-monophosphate;
  ATP, adenosine 5′-triphosphate; ADP, adenosine 5′-diphosphate; CoA, coenzyme A;
  DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; NADP+, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate;
  NADPH, reduced form of NADP+; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway;
  PPi, inorganic pyrophosphate; UDP, uridine 5′-diphosphate.
