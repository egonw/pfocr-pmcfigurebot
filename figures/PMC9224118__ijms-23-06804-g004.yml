caption: 'The JNK pathway mediates IL-17-induced promotion of VCAM-1 synthesis and
  monocyte adhesion in OASFs. (A,D) OASFs were stimulated with a JNK inhibitor (SP600125,
  10 nM) for 30 min or transfected with a JNK siRNA for 24 h and then treated with
  IL-17 (10 ng/mL) for 24 h. VCAM-1 levels were quantified by qPCR. (B,C,E,F) Adherent
  THP-1 cells were photographed and quantified under fluorescence microscopy. (G)
  JNK protein levels were measured by Western blot. (H–J) OASFs were stimulated with
  IL-17 for the indicated time intervals or pretreated with PKC or JNK inhibitors
  and then incubated with IL-17 (10 ng/mL). JNK or PKC phosphorylation was performed
  by Western blot. Size bar = 320 μm. * p < 0.05 compared with the control group;
  # p < 0.05 compared with the IL-17-stimulated group.'
