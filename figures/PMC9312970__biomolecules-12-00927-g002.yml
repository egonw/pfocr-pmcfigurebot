caption: Effect of cold stress on the liver, activity of enzyme, level of stress and
  apoptosis-related protein. (A) The histopathological examination of liver of control
  and cold groups. (Scale bar = 50 µm). (B–D) The enzyme activity of ALT, AST and
  LDH in the serum of control and cold groups. (E–G) The enzyme activity of ALT, AST
  and LDH in the liver of control and cold groups. (H) HSP70, HSP90 and Tubulin protein
  levels in each group. (I,J) Quantification of expression levels based on expression
  ratios of HSP70/Tubulin and HSP90/Tubulin. (K) Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3 and Tubulin
  protein levels in each group. (L,M) Quantification of expression levels based on
  expression ratios of Bax/Bcl-2 and Cleaved-Caspase-3/Pro-Caspase-3. Data are presented
  as mean ± standard (n = 6). NS means not significant, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, ***
  p < 0.001.
