caption: Correlation of metabolites with immune responses. Pathway analysis of plasma
  metabolites that significantly correlated (r > 0.45, p < 0.05) with (A) the TLR
  cocktail-induced innate immune response (V1) and (B) the T cell immune response
  (V3). (C) Representative correlation plots of metabolites from V1 and V3 that correlate
  with the cytokine release responses from TLR stimulated innate- and peptide pool-stimulated
  T cell immune responses. Each dot represents an individual sample. Spearman correlation
  coefficient (R) is indicated. GZB, granzyme B; fc, fold changeâ€“obtained by dividing
  the cytokine concentration in stimulated wells by unstimulated wells.
