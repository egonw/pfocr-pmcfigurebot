figure_title: Ruxolitinib enhances BMSC function in patients with aGVHD via the JAK2/STAT1
  pathway
caption: '(A) Hemoglobin levels and platelet counts in aGVHD patients with or without
  ruxolitinib treatment; n = 7 per group. (B and C) CFU-F assay (B) and adipogenesis
  and osteogenesis (C) of BMSCs isolated from patients with aGVHD with or without
  ruxolitinib treatment; n = 3–5 per group. Scale bars: 100 μm. (D and E) In vitro
  CFU-F ability (D) and differentiation potential (E) of aGVHD BMSCs treated with
  vehicle or ruxolitinib; n = 4–6 per group. Scale bars: 100 μm. (F) Relative cellular
  ROS levels in BMSCs isolated from aGVHD patients with or without ruxolitinib treatment;
  n = 3–8 per group. (G) Relative cellular ROS levels in aGVHD BMSCs after vehicle
  or ruxolitinib treatment in vitro; n = 3–4 per group. (H) Inhibition of the JAK2/STAT1
  pathway in aGVHD BMSCs after incubation with ruxolitinib (1, 5, and 20 μM) for 24
  hours in vitro. Numbers indicate the fold change of protein levels normalized to
  control. (I) JAK2 mRNA levels in aGVHD BMSCs after transfection with scrambled or
  JAK2 shRNAs. (J and K) Response of BMSC osteogenesis (J) and mitochondria metabolism
  (K) to ruxolitinib treatment after JAK2 knockdown in BMSCs derived from patients
  with aGVHD; n = 3 per group. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001, by 1-way ANOVA
  followed by unpaired, 2-tailed t test (J and K) and by unpaired, 2-tailed t test
  (A, B, E, F, and G).'
