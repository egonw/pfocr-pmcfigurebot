figure_title: SMYD3 specifically binds to the TKT promoter to promote tumour progression
caption: A, B ChIP assay was performed to compare the H3K4me3 enrichment of cells
  with or without BCI-121 treatment in S100A11-knockdown or control PDAC cells. C
  TKT mRNA expression with or without BCI-121 was analysed using RT-qPCR in S100A11-knockdown
  or control PDAC cells. D Western blotting determined the expression level of TKT
  protein with or without BCI-121 in S100A11-knockdown or control PDAC cells. E ChIP
  assay was performed to compare the SMYD3 enrichment after S100A11 knockdown in PDAC
  cells. F Control or S100A11-knockdown cells were treated with vehicle or BCI-121,
  and DNA synthesis was analysed using EdU incorporation. G Transwell assay was performed
  to compare the invasiveness of cells with or without BCI-121 in S100A11-knockdown
  or control PDAC cells. *p < 0.05. N.S., not significant. Error bars indicate mean ± SD.
