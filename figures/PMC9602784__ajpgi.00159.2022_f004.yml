caption: 'Uro A inhibits PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in ACP-induced mouse model.
  A: relative pancreas weight measurements of C57BL/6 mice after ACP induction with
  Uro A treatment. ACP with Uro A-treated mice pancreas weight was measured after
  3 days and 2 wk of recovery period with continued alcohol exposure. B: representative
  images of mice pancreas showing attenuation of acinar tissue atrophy with Uro A
  treatment in ACP-induction with continuation of alcohol for 3 days compared with
  untreated C57BL/6 mice. C and D: Western blot analysis along with its corresponding
  quantification (right) showing significant reduction in phosphorylated levels of
  AKT and P70S6K in pancreatic tissue lysates of Uro A-treated mice after ACP-induction
  compared with ACP alone. Individual data points with means ± SD are shown in each
  group. Statistical differences were compared by two-tailed unpaired t test. **P
  < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001. n = 4–7 mice/group. ACP, alcoholic chronic
  pancreatitis; CP, chronic pancreatitis; ns, nonsignificant; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol
  3 kinase; Uro A, urolithin A.'

  with continued alcohol intake by inhibiting PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling.
