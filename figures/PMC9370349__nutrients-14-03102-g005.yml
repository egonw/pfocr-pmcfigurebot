caption: Effect of BSP1, BSP3, BSP4, and VC on GPx/GR/GSH/GSSG in PC12 cells. (A–C)
  PC12 cells were incubated with BSP1, BSP3, BSP4, and VC for 4 h. (D–F) PC12 cells
  were preincubated with BSP1, BSP3, BSP4, and VC for 4 h, then treated with lead
  for 24 h. The results of GPx are shown in (A,D). The results of GR are shown in
  (B,E). The results of GSH/GSSG are shown in (C,F). The value of the bars indicates
  the means ± SD (n = at least 3). The same letter means there is no significant difference,
  and different letters mean there is a significant difference (p < 0.05).
