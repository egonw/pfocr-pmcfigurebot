caption: Dog and human brains show a more similar inter-regional expression patterns
  of ASD/Scz-related proteins compared with mouse. A, the frequency distribution of
  Pearson correlations for each ASD/Scz ortholog protein (n = 328) among dog (D),
  mouse (M), and human (H) brain proteome. The spatial expression patterns of ASD/Scz
  orthologs in adult dog brain are more similar to that in human brain compared with
  mouse brain. The box indicates disease proteins that are highly correlated between
  two of the three species (r > 0.67). B, enriched GO terms for ASD-related proteins
  with similar inter-regional expression patterns between dog and human brains and
  between mouse and human brains. C, inter-regional expression patterns of ASD-related
  proteins with similar expression patterns in D-H but different in M. The size of
  the circle indicates average expression level (z scored) of all ASD-related proteins.
  D, heatmap of z-scored intensities of representative ASD proteins whose spatial
  expression patterns are similar in adult dog and human brain (upper panel) or similar
  in mouse and human brain (lower panel). E, the enrichment score of ASD/Scz-related
  proteins in each region is defined by the ratio of actual percentage (region-enriched/total
  ASD/Scz protein number)/theoretical percentage (region-enriched/total protein number).
  ASD/Scz proteins are mostly enriched in the Hippo and PFC at S1, and in the PFC,
  Stri, and Cere at S2 and S3 (Hypergeometric test, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗∗p < 0.001). F, bubble
  heatmap shows GO or KEGG enrichment results of temporally regulated ASD or non-ASD
  proteins from newborn to juvenile stage (Fisher’s exact test, fc > 1.5, adjusted
  p < 0.05). Size and color of dots indicate fold enrichment for that pathway and
  adjusted p value, respectively. The upregulated ASD-related proteins were specifically
  involved in synapse-related functions in PFC, Stri, and Cere (indicated by red box)
  while the downregulated ASD-related proteins were specifically involved in transcription
  in all regions. ASD, autism spectrum disorder; Cere, cerebellum; GO, gene ontology;
  Hippo, hippocampus; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; PFC, prefrontal
  cortex; Scz, schizophrenia; Stri, striatum.
