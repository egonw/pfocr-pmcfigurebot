caption: 'Differential metabolic features and pathways between TCTs and ANTs. (A,B)
  Score plots of PCA and PLS–DA for TNTs and ANTs. (C) Results of 1000–times permutation
  tests of PLS–DA model by cross–validation for TCTs vs. ANTs. (D) Volcano diagram
  revealing changes between TCTs and ANTs. The red dots on the right side of the figure
  represent upregulated metabolites, the blue dots on the left side mean downregulated
  metabolites, and the black dots refer to non-significant differences. The x-axis
  corresponds to the log2-fold change, and the y-axis corresponds to the –log10 p-value.
  (E) Enrichment pathways of differential metabolic features between TCTs and ANTs.
  The color of the circle indicates the significance level in the enrichment analysis,
  where a darker color indicates greater significance (pathways with p < 0.05 were
  annotated); the size of the circle reflects the pathway impact value in the topology
  analysis, where the larger the circle, the larger the impact value. The x-axis is
  the pathway impact value calculated based on topology analysis. TNT: thymic cancerous
  tissue; ANT: adjunct noncancerous tissue; QC: quality control; NS: non-significant.'
