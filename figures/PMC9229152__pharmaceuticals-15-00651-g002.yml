caption: 'Protein expression level in the different molecular BC subgroups. (A) NLRP3
  expression. (B) PYCARD expression. (C) CyclinD1 expression and (D) MYC expression
  by Anova test. IRS: Immuno Reactive Score. The IRS was calculated by the product
  of the proportional score (PS) obtained from the percentage of positive cells and
  the intensity of the staining (see materials and methods section). Values are expressed
  as a median (horizontal bold line in each box), dot indicates outliers. * p < 0.05;
  ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001.'
