figure_title: MLN4924 inhibited the NEDDylation of CULs in AML cells
caption: (A) MLN4924 significantly inhibited the NEDD8 NEDDylation of CUL1-5 in THP-1
  cells. (B) In MOLM-13 cells, the NEDDylation of CUL1-5 was also inhibited. (C) MLN4924
  inhibited the NEDD8 NEDDylation of CUL1-5 in primary AML cells collected from two
  AML patients. (Dâ€“G) Statistical analysis revealed that MLN4924 inhibited the NEDD8
  NEDDylation of CULs in THP-1 cells; ***P<0.001, **P<0.01. An independent sample
  t-test was adopted to compare the means between two groups. Each experiment was
  conducted in trplicate.
