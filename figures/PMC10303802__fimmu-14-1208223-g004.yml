caption: 'Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and pathway enrichments between hDNAmad+
  and – tumors in the TCGA EC cohort. A total of 429 tumors were analyzed. (A) The
  heatmap showing DEGs between hDNAmad+ and – EC tumors. (B) The identification of
  enriched cell cycle and DNA mismatch repair pathways in hDNAmad+ tumors by GSEA
  analysis. (C) Significantly higher expression of Ki-67 and cell cycle score in hDNAmad+
  tumors. (D) The hyperactivation of the PI3K-AKT pathway in hDNAmad+ tumors. Left:
  Diminished SCGB2A expression in hDNAmad+ tumors. Right: Top plot showing increased
  PIK3CA amplification and mutations in hDNAmad+ tumors. The bottom schematic illustrates
  how increased PIK3CA alterations and downregulated SCGB2A1 result in PI3K-AKT pathway
  activation, thereby promoting cell proliferation. In hDNAmad+ tumors, higher frequency
  of PIK3CA [encoding p110α, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) subunit] amplification
  and mutation enhances PI3K activity, while lower expression of SCGB2A1, an inhibitor
  of PIK3CA kinase, further augments PI3K signaling activation. Such hyperactivated
  PI3K proteins catalyze more phosphorylation of PIP2 to generate PIP3. PDK1 then
  phosphorylates AKT in the presence of PIP3, which, together with MTOR2-mediated
  phosphorylation, consequently, activates AKT. The super-activation of the PI3K-AKT
  cascade promotes EC cell proliferation. RTK: Receptor tyrosine kinase; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. (E) Enhanced stemness
  score in hDNAmad+ EC tumors.'
