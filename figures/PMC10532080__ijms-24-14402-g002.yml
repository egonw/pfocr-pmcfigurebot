caption: BAP31 is associated with stemness of CRC cells in vitro. (A) Representative
  images of sphere formation assay of HCT116 and SW480 cells. Scale bar, 100 μm. (B)
  Western blot was used to detect expression of BAP31, CD44, CD133, Oct4, and Nanog
  in HCT116 and SW480 cells. (C) Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
  assay was used to detect mRNA expression of Oct4 and Nanog in HCT116 and SW480 cells.
  β-actin was used as loading control. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
