caption: Classical signaling pathways were identified in this study. The X-axis label
  represents the rich factor, and the Y-axis label shows the KEGG pathways. The rich
  factor reflects the proportion of differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) in a
  given pathway. The greater the rich factor, the greater the degree of pathway enrichment.
  The color of the dots represents the enrichment score [âˆ’log10(p-value)], where red
  indicates high enrichment and green indicates low enrichment. Dot size represents
  the number of DEmRNAs in the corresponding pathway (bigger dots indicate larger
  DEmRNA numbers).
