caption: Immunoblotting studies on NF-κB. (A) Western blot analysis shows the expression
  of the transcription factor NF-κB after 3h of incubation. The NF-κB subunit p65
  (Rel A) was downregulated in capsicodendrin-treated MCF-7 cells and the effect on
  protein expression was concentration-dependent. The positive control was treated
  with rocaglamide and the negative control was not treated. β-Actin was used as an
  internal control. (B) Western blot analysis showed the expression of proteins in
  the NF-κB pathway. The expression of IκB kinase β (IKKβ) was downregulated in capsicodendrin
  treated MCF-7 cells and the effect was concentration dependent. β-Actin was used
  as an internal control.
