caption: EPPK1 decreased in ESCC tissues and cells. (a) The expression level of EPPK1
  in tumor tissues and normal tissues obtained from the TCGA+ GTEx database. (b) The
  expression level of EPPK1 in paired cancer and normal tissues obtained from the
  TCGA database. (c) The mRNA level of EPPK1 in ESCC tissues and para‐carcinoma tissues
  measured by qPCR (p < 0.05). (d) The mRNA level of EPPK1 in 14 pairs of ESCC tissues
  and para‐carcinoma tissues (p < 0.05). (e) The mRNA level of EPPK1 in ESCC and normal
  cells measured by qPCR (p < 0.05). Values represent means ± SD, n = 3. *p < 0.05,
