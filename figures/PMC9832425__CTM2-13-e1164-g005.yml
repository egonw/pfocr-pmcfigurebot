caption: 'The Myc–IMPDH1/2 axis promotes colorectal cancer (CRC) growth by regulating
  GTP metabolic reprogramming: (A) colony formation of RKO and HT29 cells stably expressing
  the indicated vectors or treated with GTP (100 μM) (left), and bar graphs showing
  the colony numbers (right); (B) CCK‐8 assays were performed in RKO and HT29 cells
  stably expressing the indicated plasmids or treated with GTP (100 μM); (C) tumour
  photographs from subcutaneous xenograft; n = 5, per group; (D) subcutaneous xenograft
  experiments were performed in HT29 cells stably expressing the indicated plasmids;
  (E) analyses of GTP levels in tumour tissues from subcutaneous xenograft experiments;
  (F and G) inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 (IMPDH1)–IMPDH2 interaction via
  N‐terminal and C‐terminal domains. Generation of IMPDH2‐mutant constructs (F) and
  IMPDH1‐mutant constructs (G). HEK293T cell lysates transfected with indicated plasmids
  analysed for co‐immunoprecipitation (Co‐IP); (H) correlation analysis between IMPDH1
  and IMPDH2, based on CPTAC and DepMap CRC datasets; (I) time‐course analysis of
  IMPDH1 protein levels in IMPDH2‐overexpressed HEK293T cells; (J) IMPDH2 depletion
  increases the polyubiquitination levels of IMPDH1. HEK293T cells were transfected
  with the indicated plasmids, treated with MG132 for 6 h and then lysed in lysis
  buffer. Immunoprecipitation of ubiquitin‐conjugated IMPDH1 proteins with anti‐FLAG
  affinity agarose and subjected to immunoblot assay with Myc tag antibody; (K) Myc
  occupancy on the IMPDH1 promoters. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed
  with the endogenous Myc antibody in HT29 and RKO cells transfected with shCtrl or
  shMyc plasmid. qPCR analysis was performed on the endogenous promoters of IMPDH1
  gene; (L) schematic diagram of the GTP biosynthesis pathway; (M) heat maps showing
  correlations between Myc expression level and Myc signatures and de novo GTP biosynthesis
  module activity in the TCGA and CPTAC CRC datasets. Data are presented as mean ± SD;
  *p < .05, **p < .01. ***p < .001'
