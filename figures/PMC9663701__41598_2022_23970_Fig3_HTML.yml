caption: 'Atf1 response to stress is independent of Srk1. (a) Total extracts from
  growing cultures of wild-type and srk1∆ cells expressing genomic atf1:HA6his were
  untreated (0 min) or treated with 0.8 M KCl at the indicated times and resolved
  in SDS-PAGE. Total Atf1 protein was detected with anti-HA antibody. (b) atf1 deleted
  cells with (+) or without (−) Srk1 overexpression (OP Srk1: through the inducible
  plasmid pREP1-srk1:HA6his) for 20 h were untreated or treated with 0.8 M KCl for
  15 min. Activated (Sty1-P) and total Sty1 were detected with anti-phospho p38 and
  anti-HOG1 antibodies, respectively. The level of overexpressed Srk1 was detected
  with anti-HA antibody. Anti-Cdc2 was used as a loading control (a and b). All blot
  membranes were cut prior antibodies incubation.'
