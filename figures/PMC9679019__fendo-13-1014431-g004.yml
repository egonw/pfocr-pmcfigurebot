caption: Cellular apoptosis comparisons among osteoclasts transfected with empty,
  and wild-type and mutant of NRP1 rs180868035 vectors. (A) flow cytometry. Representative
  APC-A-area versus 7-AAD-A-area density plots of different treatment groups with
  percentages of cells at different stage of apoptosis shown in the relevant quadrants.
  Q1-UR quadrant is positive for both APC-A and 7-AAD-A and represents cells in late
  apoptosis; Q1-LR is APC-A positive/7-AAD-A negative and represents cells in early
  apoptosis; Q1-LL is negative for both APC-A and 7-AAD-A and contains viable cells;
  Q1-UL is 7-AAD-A positive/APC-A negative and contains cells undergoing necrosis.
  (B) histogram of osteoclast apoptosis. ** indicated P < 0.001.
