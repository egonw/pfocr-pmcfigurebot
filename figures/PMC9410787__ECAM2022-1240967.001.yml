caption: Results of GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of the overlapped genes between
  HXTLF and small vasculitis. (a) Venn diagram. (b) PPI network diagram. (c) Bar charts
  of biological process, molecular function, and cellular component in GO analysis.
  GO terms are on the left, and abscissa represents gene count. (d) Circle diagram
  of KEGG pathway enrichment. The right outer layer indicates metabolic pathways and
  the left indicates genes. The left inner circle indicates p values for significance
  for the corresponding pathways.
