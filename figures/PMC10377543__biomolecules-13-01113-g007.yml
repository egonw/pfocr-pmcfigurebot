caption: Evidence for the role of the myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF)–serum
  response factor (SRF) pathway in the maturation of MG63 cells treated with Dcha-150
  and FHBP. MG63s were co-stimulated with FHBP (500 nM) and Dcha-150 (Dc, 1 nM, as
  informed from ) for 72 h in the presence (“All”) and absence of CCG 203971 (CCG,
  5 μM), an inhibitor of MRTF–SRF gene transcription. The clear and significant inhibition
  of ALP activity for cells exposed to all agents (** p < 0.001 compared to FHBP and
  Dc co-treated cells) supports the role of MRTF–SRF in the maturation of osteoblasts
  to FHBP–Dcha-150 co-stimulation. The data are the mean plus the standard deviation
  from two pooled, independent experiments, each performed on a different occasion
  using a different passage number of cells (n = 8 for Dc, n = 10 for all other groups).
