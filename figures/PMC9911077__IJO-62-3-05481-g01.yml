caption: Apoptotic pathway serves a key role in the effects of α-hederin on overcoming
  hypoxia-mediated resistance in CRC cells. (A) Differentially expressed genes were
  observed in a volcano plot. (B) Enrichment analysis of GO terms. (C) Enrichment
  analysis of KEGG pathways. (D) Gene expression profiling was conducted to observe
  the changes in related genes after α-hederin treatment of CRC cells under hypoxia.
  (E) Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was used to measure the expression levels
  of Bcl2 and Bcl-xL in CRC cells treated with α-hederin under hypoxia. Data are presented
  as the mean ± SD. *P<0.05, **P<0.01. CRC, colorectal cancer; GO, Gene Ontology;
