caption: 'Domain negative FGFR2 weakened osteogenesis through the Erk1/2 signaling
  pathway: (A) CCK-8 assays showed the proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells was inhibited
  in the DN FGFR2 group compared with the MT group. (B) Relative expressions of osteogenic
  genes such as ColIα2, Runx2, Alp, Ocn and Opn were decreased in the DN group compared
  with the MT group measured by qRT-PCR. The level of ALP, COLI and RUNX2 was inhibited
  in the DN group, as detected by Western blot. (C) ALP staining and quantification
  of the ALP activity of MC3T3-E1 was decreased in the DN group. Alizarin red staining
  and the quantification of mineral content demonstrated that the mineral content
  of MC3T3-E1 was significantly reduced in the DN group. (D) Western blot showed that
  the expressions of t-FGFR2, p-FGFER2 and p-Erk1/2 were remarkably decreased in the
  DN group. (E) Alterations after using U0126 proved the positive role of Erk1/2 MAPK
  on osteogenesis. Western blot demonstrated that the Erk1/2 MAPK pathway was inhibited
  by U0126 and the levels of osteogenic marker, COLI, RUNX2 and ALP were decreased.
  (F) MEK inhibitor, U0126, suppressed the proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells. (G) The
  expressions of Alp, ColIα2, Runx2, Opn and Ocn mRNA detected by qRT-PCR were reduced
  by using U0126. (H) ALP staining, alizarin red staining and quantification test
  demonstrated that both ALP activity and mineralization were decreased after the
  Erk1/2 MAPK pathway was inhibited. p values were significant at * p < 0.05, ** p
  < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 and **** p < 0.0001.'
