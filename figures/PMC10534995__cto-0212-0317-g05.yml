caption: SMF induced activation of the AKT signaling pathway. a The protein expression
  level of AKT was determined by Western blot after cells were cultured for 24 h with
  or without SMF exposure. b The protein expression level of AKT was determined by
  Western blot after cells were cultured for 14 days with or without SMF exposure.
  All experiments were performed in triplicate, and the values are expressed as the
  mean Â± SD. *p < 0.05.
