caption: 'MAPK signaling pathway in female LTC4SKO mice shows the reduced activity
  levels of p38 and ERK in protein brain lysates. The quantification of Western blot
  densitometries of: phosphorylated p38 MAPK (pp38)/total p38/tubulin (p38) (A); phosphorylated
  ERK1/2 (pERK)/total ERK1/2/tubulin (ERK) (B); and phosphorylated JNK1/2 (pJNK)/total
  JNK1/2/tubulin (JNK) (C) all normalized to their respective wild type control. Representative
  images of the blots are shown with male and female samples separated by a protein
  ladder lane are for p38 (D), ERK1/2 (E), and JNK1/2 (F). Male (blue) and female
  (red) data sets are shown, separated by a dashed line. Values in graphs are mean
  ± s.e.m.; n = 4–6 per genotype for both male and female data sets, 12 months of
  age. Individual data points are represented in the graphs by an ⚪ symbol. ANOVA
  and Fisher’s PLSD post hoc test for males and females were analyzed independently
  while normalized to their respective WT controls; p-value level of significance
  is as follows: * p ≤ 0.05, @@ p ≤ 0.01, @@@ p ≤ 0.001—while the p-value significance
  correlations are symbolized as follows: * indicates significances from the WT, @
  indicates significances from HIVgp120tg.'
