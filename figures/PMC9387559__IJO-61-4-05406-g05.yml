caption: linc01614 perturbs the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway in PC. (A) GSEA analysis
  suggesting a positive association between linc01614 and the WNT/β-catenin signaling
  pathway in PC. (B) TOP/FOP Flash reporter assay, for the examination of the WNT
  signaling pathway activity in Panc-1 and SW1990 cells following transfection with
  ASO-NC, ASO-1, or ASO-2. (C and D) mRNA and protein levels of several vital proteins
  involved in the WNT signaling pathway in ASO-NC-, ASO-1-, or ASO-2-transfected PC
  cells. (E) Western blot analysis was used to measure the nuclear and cytoplasmic
  levels of active β-catenin and total β-catenin in PC cells transfected with ASO-NC,
  ASO-1, or ASO-2. GAPDH and LaminB were used as internal cytoplasmic and nuclear
  controls, respectively. (F) Western blot analysis of β-catenin in normal PC cells
  or PC cells treated with ASO-NC, ASO-1, LiCl, ASO-NC + LiCl, and ASO-1 + LiCl. Data
  are presented as the mean ± SD. (ns, not significant). One-way ANOVA with Tukey's
  test was employed to compare the expression of β-catenin in each group. *P<0.05,
  **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001. p GSEA, Gene-set enrichment analysis; PC, pancreatic cancer;
  ASO, antisense oligonucleotide; NC, negative control; SD, standard deviation.
