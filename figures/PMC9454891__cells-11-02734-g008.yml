caption: Effects of apigetrin on necroptotic markers. Treated Hep3B cells were harvested,
  and cell lysate was subjected to western blot. p-RIP3 and p-MLKL levels were calculated
  based on densitometry analysis. Results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation
  (SD) from three independent experiments. ** p < 0.01 vs. control, *** p < 0.001
  vs. control.
