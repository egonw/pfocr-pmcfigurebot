caption: RASSF4 regulates Bcl‐2 and 5‐FU sensitivity through YAP. (A) Western blot
  demonstrated that RASSF4 overexpression decreased the protein expression of YAP,
  Bcl‐2 and increased p21. RASSF4 knockdown increased the protein expression of YAP,
  Bcl‐2 and decreased p21. (B) YAP siRNA efficiently downregulated YAP protein. YAP
  knockdown also downregulated Bcl‐2 protein. In YAP‐depleted cells, the effects of
  RASSF4 siRNA on Bcl‐2 were largely abolished. (C) CCK‐8 assay showed that in HCT‐8
  cells treated with YAP siRNA, the change of 5‐FU sensitivity induced by RASSF4 knockdown
  was significantly reduced. (D) RT‐qPCR showed that YAP knockdown significantly suppressed
  mRNA expression of Bcl‐2. YAP depletion also ameliorated the effect of RASSF4 siRNA
  on Bcl‐2. (E) Prediction of potential TEAD4 binding motifs using JASPAR database.
  (F) Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay demonstrated that TEAD4 could bind
  to the Bcl‐2 promoter regions. *p < 0.05
