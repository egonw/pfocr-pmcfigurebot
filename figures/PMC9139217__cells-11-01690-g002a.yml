caption: 'Cisplatin treatment resulted in damage to the testes of male mice and increased
  oxidative stress. (A) Experimental design. (B) Changes in the body weight of mice
  during different recovery periods after cisplatin treatment. (C) Images of mouse
  testes sizes. (D) Images of mouse epididymides sizes. (E) Mouse epididymides stained
  with H&E (scale bar = 50 μm). (F) Mouse testicular cross sections stained with H&E
  (scale bar = 50 μm). Arrows: Leydig cells of the testes. (G) Weight of mouse epididymides
  during different recovery periods after cisplatin treatment. (H) Mouse testicular
  weight during different recovery periods after cisplatin treatment. (I) Detection
  of the testosterone level in the mouse testes. (J) Epididymal sperm count. (K) Detection
  of serum MDA in mice. (L) Detection of serum SOD activity in mice. (M) Detection
  of serum total antioxidant capacity in mice. (N) Detection of the serum melatonin
  level in mice. CP, cisplatin. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. N = 6 mice per
  group. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 versus the control groups.'
