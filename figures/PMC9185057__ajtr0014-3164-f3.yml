caption: 'Comparison of reactive oxygen species expression in cells between groups
  (×400). (A) The expression of reactive oxygen species in HT22 cells after hypoxia-reoxygenation
  was much higher than that in control group (P<0.05). The ROS is showing in green
  in (B), and the level of ROS was decreased after treatment with crocin (P<0.05).
  As the crocin concentration increased, the expression of ROS in cells decreased
  more significantly. (B) Control group. (C) OGD group. (D) Low dose group. (E) Medium
  dose group. (F) High dose group. Note: Compared with control group, *P<0.05; Compared
  with OGD group, #P<0.05; Compared with Low dose group, ΔP<0.05; Compared with Medium
  dose group, ○P<0.05.'
