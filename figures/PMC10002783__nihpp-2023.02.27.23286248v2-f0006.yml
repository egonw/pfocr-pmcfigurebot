figure_title: RNA sequencing analysis of RHO-CNV organoids following PR3 treatment
caption: (A) Volcano plot showing significant differentially expressed genes following
  1 week of PR3 treatment in D300+ patient organoids with cutoffs at p<0.01 and ~1log2FC.
  (B) 3D principal component analysis (PCA) plot showing the tightly clustered independent
  biological replicates. Additionally, PR3 treated patient organoids were spatially
  closer to control (RC) compared to patient (RM) organoids. (C) Normalized read count
  plots showing relative expression of RHO, GNAT1, SAG and NR2E3. (D) KEGG analysis
  of differentially expressed genes showing dysregulation of key phototransduction
  pathway comparing RC with RM organoids and the recovery following PR3 treatment
  in RM organoids. Down- and up-regulated genes are indicated in blue and red respectively.
  (E, F) Box plots showing EnrichGO analysis of differentially expressed genes that
  are either downregulated (E) or upregulated (F) by comparing PR3 treated to vehicle
  treated organoids. N=3 independent experiments and 12â€“15 organoids per experiment.
  Log2FC=Log2 Fold change.
