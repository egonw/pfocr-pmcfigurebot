caption: Effect of Sesn2 on ox-LDL–induced M1 macrophage polarization in vitro. A,
  F4/80+CD86+ cells were examined in the 5 groups by flow cytometry. B, CD86 intensity
  was measured using immunofluorescence staining. C, The mRNA expression levels of
  CD38, CD80, CD86, and iNOS were investigated by RT–PCR. N = 6 in each group. *P
  < 0.05 versus the ox-LDL + siRNA or cDNA group.
