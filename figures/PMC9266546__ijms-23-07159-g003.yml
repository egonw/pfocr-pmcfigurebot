caption: 'Identification of altered pathways following ERβ agonist treatment using
  RNA seq analysis. SKOV3 ALDH+ve cells were treated with vehicle or LY500307 for
  24 h, RNA was isolated and then subjected to RNA sequencing. (A) Volcano plots comparing
  gene expression levels for vehicle vs. LY500307 treated OCSCs. Counts values were
  normalized with DESeq2, X-axis showed the Log2 fold change of gene expression levels
  between groups, and Y-axis indicates -log10(p-value). Significantly upregulated
  or downregulated genes were marked in red and blue, respectively, with the criteria
  of p < 0.05 and |log2(fold change)| > 0.5. The top 10 DEGs, including CDKN1A and
  FDXR, are labeled. (B) Heatmap showing top up- and downregulated DEGs. (C) Bubble
  plot of top GSEA hallmark gene set enrichment results. Y-axis showed the gene set
  names; X-axis indicated the normalized enrichment scores (NES). Positive NES indicates
  gene set enrichment in LY500307 treated group, while negative NES indicates gene
  set enrichment in Vehicle treated group. Dot size indicates the gene number enriched.
  Color demonstrates –log10(FDR), showing the significance of enrichment. (D–G) GSEA
  of LY500307 modulated genes shows correlation with signatures of apoptosis, p53
  pathway, cell cycle, and G2/M checkpoint gene sets. (H,I) SKOV3- and A2780- ALDH+ve
  cells were treated with vehicle or LY500307 for 24 h, and selected genes involved
  in p53 pathway, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression were validated using RT-qPCR.
  Data are represented as mean ± SE. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; ****
  p < 0.0001. NES: normalized enrichment score; FDR: false discovery rate.'
