caption: Cancer cell apoptosis induced by Eriodictyol involves extrinsic pathway.
  A. Western immunoblots depicting increase in the expression levels of TNFR1, FADD
  and TRADD in HeLa cells upon Eriodictyol treatment. B. Eriodictyol treatment increases
  the expression of Bax and decreases the expression of Bcl2 and Survivin time dependently.
  C. Western immunoblots showing activation of DNA damage responsive protein expression
  in HeLa upon Eriodictyol treatment. D. Activation of the caspase cascade and PARP1
  cleavage in HeLa cells upon Eriodictyol treatment. E, F. Density plot and column
  graph from flow cytometry analysis (BD FACSuiteTM) showing Eriodictyol mediated
  apoptosis in presence of pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK) at 20 µM concentration,
  indicating that Eriodictyol mediated apoptosis is partially caspase dependent. G.
  Caspase 3/7 activity in response to Eriodictyol treatment at 24, 48, and 72 h is
  depicted in a column graph. Data represent Mean ± SEM of three independent experiments,
  analyzed by Student's t-test (two-tailed); *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001,
  ns not significant.
