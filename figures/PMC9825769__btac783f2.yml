caption: Main functions and usage of CanMethdb. (A) Four inquiry modes and search
  results including statistics of annotations for related CpGs, basic information
  of chosen cancer types and the number of cancer samples of cis-regulatory elements
  and TFs for cancer samples. (B) Details about upstream and downstream annotations
  for a CpG and its target genes. (C) Three online tools to interactively analyze
  the gene regulation, including ‘3D validation analysis’, ‘Pathway enrichment analysis’
  and ‘Regulatory subnetwork analysis’. (D) Browsing details of CpG–target gene pairs
  in 33 cancers. (E) Genome browser to visualize the upstream cis-regulatory elements
  and TFs for CpGs and genes
