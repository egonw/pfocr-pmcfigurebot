caption: 'The variation of cell differentiation-related genes and metabolism-related
  genes between the non-SD group and SD group in mouse ELGs. (A) The diurnal changes
  of mouse AWT of non-SD-treated and SD-treated mouse models in the LD cycle were
  recorded at day 28. The gray shading indicates dark cycles (non-SD-treated ELGs:
  F = 3.520, P < 0.05; SD-treated ELGs: F = 1.501, P > 0.05). **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
  (B) The changes of mouse AWT of non-SD-treated and SD-treated mice in an LD cycle
  were recorded at day 28. ***P < 0.001. (C) Overall longitudinal view of the murine
  lacrimal glands from the non-SD group and SD group at ZT18. Scale bar: 500 µm. (D)
  The circadian oscillating pattern of ELG cell size for the non-SD group and SD group
  in the LD cycle (non-SD-treated mice: F = 19.983, P < 0.001; SD-treated mice: F
  = 2.125, P > 0.05). **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. (E) The average cell size of ELG cell
  size for the non-SD group and SD group in the LD cycle. ***P < 0.001. (F) The representative
  immunohistochemical images of ELG cell size for the non-SD group and SD group at
  ZT18. Scale bar: 20 µm. (G, H) The enriched cell cycle-related KEGG pathways and
  heatmap were created by GSEA in the non-SD group and SD group. (I-M) Heatmaps of
  diurnal expression for cell cycle (I), cell growth (J), cell proliferation (K),
  cell apoptosis (L), cell senescence-related genes (M) between the non-SD group and
  SD group in mouse ELGs. The expression levels of cell cycle-related genes were obtained
  from RNA-Seq and expression range of DEGs was normalized to ± 3. (N) Diurnal oscillations
  of the relative abundance of Ki67+ cells by using immunohistochemistry in the ELGs
  for the non-SD group and SD group at six-hour intervals (non-SD-treated mice: F
  = 2.535, P > 0.05; SD-treated mice: F = 6.062, P < 0.01). Each time point shows
  the median and SEM. *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001. (O) Average relative abundance of Ki67+
  cells of ELGs from the non-SD group and SD group. ***P < 0.001. (P-Q) Representative
  immunohistochemistry images (Ki67+ cells) of mouse ELGs at ZT6 from the non-SD group
  and SD group. The sectional view of ELG structure from the non-SD group (P) and
  SD group (Q). Scale bar: 50 µm. (R) Heatmaps of diurnal expression for metabolism-related
  genes between the non-SD group and SD group in mouse ELGs. The expression levels
  of metabolism-related genes were obtained from RNA-Seq and expression range of DEGs
  was normalized to ±3. (S) The top 10 KEGG pathways enriched histogram of metabolism-related
  genes with Q < 0.05 were displayed. (T) The PPANs and functional clusters (Clusters
  1–4) with relevant KEGG pathway of metabolism-related genes between the non-SD group
  and SD group in mouse ELGs (Q < 0.001).'
