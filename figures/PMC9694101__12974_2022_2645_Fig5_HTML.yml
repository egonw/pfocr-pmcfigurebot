caption: Knock-down miR-26a-3p caused synaptic dysfunction in hippocampal neurons.
  A Representative electronic micrographs of hippocampal neuron. B Knock-down miR-26a-3p
  decreased the number of synapses in hippocampal neuron. C Representative images
  of the ultrastructure of synapse. D Knock-down miR-26a-3p decreased in the thickness
  of post-synaptic density zone of synapse. E Raw traces of mEPSC by patch-clamp recordings.
  F Knock-down miR-26a-3p decreased the amplitude of mEPSC. G Knock-down miR-26a-3p
  decreased the frequency of mEPSC. H Raw traces of sEPSC by patch-clamp recordings.
  I Knock-down miR-26a-3p decreased the amplitude of sEPSC. J Knock-down miR-26a-3p
  decreased the frequency of sEPSC. Data are presented as the means ± SEMs. N = 9
  neuros from 4 rats per group. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001
