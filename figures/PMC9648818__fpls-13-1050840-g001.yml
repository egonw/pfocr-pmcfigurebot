caption: (A) Venn diagram showing specific and common differentially expressed genes
  in ‘jx1502’ and ‘gold crown’ under salt stress. (B, C) Significantly enriched GO
  terms and KEGG pathways with ‘jx1502’-specific, ‘gold crown’-specific, and common
  DEGs under salt stress. The color scale represents the p-value of the enriched term
  and pathway. The black boxes indicate that there are no DEGs that were enriched
  in the corresponding term or pathway.
