caption: Expression of BCL11A in different cell lines and knockdown cell lines. (A,
  B) Using 293T cells as the control, the mRNA and protein expression levels of BCL11A
  in different neuroblastoma cell lines were assessed. (C, D) The transcription level
  and protein expression of BCL11A were decreased after transfected with si-BCL11A.
  **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001 vs. control.
