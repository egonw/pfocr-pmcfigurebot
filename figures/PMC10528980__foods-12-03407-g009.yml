caption: 'Distinctly differential Genes and metabolites pathway enrichment bubble
  plot. The horizontal axis is the pathway effect, and the vertical axis is the âˆ’log(p)
  value. The node color is based on the p-value, from light to dark, and the p-value
  from large to small; the node radius is based on its pathway impact value, from
  small to large, and the impact value from small to large. (1: Glycerolipid metabolism;
  2: Glycerophospholipid metabolism; 3: Terpenoid backbone biosynthesis; 4: Steroid
  biosynthesis; 5: Retinol metabolism; 6: Drug metabolism-other enzymes; 7: Arginine
  biosynthesis; 8: Alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism; 9: Neomycin, kanamycin
  and gentamicin biosynthesis; and 10: Phenylalanine metabolism).'
