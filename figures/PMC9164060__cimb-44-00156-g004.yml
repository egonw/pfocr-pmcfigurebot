caption: Real-time PCR analysis during odontogenic differentiation in hDPSCs. (A–D)
  Odontogenic differentiation marker gene expression was evaluated using real-time
  PCR. Expression of APL, RUNX-2, OC, and DMP-1 in hDPSCs treated with 50, 100 and
  200 μM of bakuchiol. (E) Western blot analysis for the expression of odontogenic
  differentiation protein markers DMP-1 and DSPP. (F) Western blot analysis to determine
  the effect of bakuchiol on SMAD 1/5/8 phosphorylation cell signaling pathway during
  odontogenic differentiation. All data are presented as the mean ± SEM (n = 3). *
  p < 0.05, ** p < 0.02 SEM, standard error of mean; NC, negative control; CON, positive
  control; hDPSCs, human dental pulp stem cells; PCR, polymerase chain reaction.
