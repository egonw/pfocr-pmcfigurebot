caption: STAT interactome. Global STAT interactome presenting all literature‐based
  STAT PPIs. Each node (dot) is a protein, and each edge (line) is an interaction
  between two proteins. The size of the nodes is proportional to their degree, and
  the color of each node is representative of the biological process of the protein
  as described in the legend. The length of the edges connecting each node is arbitrary.
  Proteins which were found to interact with multiple STATs are grouped in the middle,
  and those exclusive to one STAT are grouped around that corresponding STAT member.
  A summary table of all interactions can be found in Table
