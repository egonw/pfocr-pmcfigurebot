caption: Functional gene expression analysis of COVID-19, influenza, and lymphocytic
  non-influenza myocarditis heart tissues. A Functional Pathway analysis via gene
  set enrichment analysis against the Gene Ontology aspect biological functions highlights
  the differential functional gene expression in the heart tissue of COVID-19 and
  influenza patients. The activation of biological functions in cardiac injury patterns
  compared to healthy controls was predicted for each sample. Color indicates up-
  (red) and down (blue)-regulation; circle size depicts FDR. Only significantly up-or
  down-regulated pathways are shown. B Spider-Plot depicting the enrichment of biological
  functions from Gene Ontology based on gene expression data of COVID-19 and influenza
  heart samples as compared with expression in non-infected control specimen. The
  y-axis shows the normalized enrichment scores (NES) on a scale from 0 to 2. C Venn
  diagram of statistically differentially expressed genes of COVID-19 and influenza
  heart samples as compared with expression in controls in both disease groups (Student’s
  t test, controlled for the familywise error rate with a Benjamini–Hochberg false
  discovery rate threshold of 0.05). Up-regulation and down-regulation of genes are
  indicated by colored arrowheads suffixed to the gene symbols (green denotes upregulation,
  red denotes down-regulation). Numbers given are the total of differentially regulated
  genes, displayed are the top 10 up- or down-regulated genes. Note that there were
  no differentially expressed genes for lymphocytic non-influenza myocarditis
