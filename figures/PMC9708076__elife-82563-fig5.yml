figure_title: Suppressor mutants are partially restored for phagocytosis and can disseminate
  in the intravenous infection model of cryptococcosis
caption: (A) Mice were infected with 1×104 fungal cells intranasally, and their survival
  was monitored for 60 days post-infection. (B) At day 35 post-infection (DPI 35)
  and at the time of termination (DPI 60), 5 out of 10 mice per group for the cbk1Δ
  mutant, sup1 and sup2 groups were harvested for brains, kidneys, and lungs. For
  H99 infected mice, they were euthanized at their clinical end point (all before
  DPI 26). Tissue homogenate was serially diluted and plated onto YNB(yeast nitrogen
  base) medium to count the colony-forming units (CFUs) to measure the fungal burden
  per organ. (C) Murine macrophage J774A.1 cells were co-incubated with 2×106 cryptococcal
  cells opsonized with serum from naïve mouse for 2 hr. Non-adherent or phagocytosed
  cells were washed, and cryptococcal cells were released and then serially diluted
  before plating onto YNB medium for measurement of CFUs. (D) The same as above, except
  opsonization, was performed with serum of mice vaccinated against cryptococcosis.
  (E) Mice were challenged with 1×105 cryptococcal cells intravenously. At day 5 post-infection,
  five mice per group were sacrificed. Brains, kidneys, and lungs of euthanized mice
  were dissected and homogenized. Serial dilutions were plated to count CFUs for quantification
  of fungal burden per organ.
