caption: Expression of miR-4730 in tissue samples and cell lines. (A) Comparison of
  miR-4730 expression between non-tumorous liver tissue and tumor tissue. A total
  of 70 patients with LC were examined. Non-tumorous liver tissue was collected from
  the peritumoral liver tissue of patients with LC. miR-4730 expression was significantly
  low in tumor tissue (P=0.006). The Wilcoxon t-test was used to analyze the data
  (**P<0.01). (B) Kaplan-Meier curves for recurrence-free survival following surgery.
  Patients were divided into the high and low expression groups according to the median
  value of miR-4730 expression in tumor tissue divided by that in non-tumorous tissue.
  The low expression group exhibited a significantly worse prognosis (P=0.007). (C)
  Expression of miR-4730 in four LC cell lines and two non-LC cell lines. miR-4730
  expression in LC cell lines was significantly lower than that in non-LC cell lines
  (P=0.003). The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to analyze the data (**P<0.01, vs. LC).
  All experiments were performed in triplicate. Results are shown as the mean Â± SD.
  LC, liver cancer; T, tumor tissue; NT, non-tumor tissue.
