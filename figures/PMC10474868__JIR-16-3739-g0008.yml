caption: 'Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of SNAI1, CDH1, CDH2, MMP2, and MMP9 in
  THLE-3 (Aa), HepG2 (Ab), C3A (Ac), and SNU-449 cells (Ad) after incubation for 48
  h in medium supplemented with 20 ng/mL of transforming growth factor, tumor necrosis
  factor, epidermal growth factor, and a growth factor cocktail. mRNA levels were
  determine with real-time polymerase chain reaction. The bars represent the means
  with standard deviations (n = 4). Relative expression was calculated using the reference
  gene (GAPDH) and the non-treated group (value = 0). The expression is presented
  as log2(fold change). Values above 0 indicate an increase in gene expression. Values
  below 0 indicate a decrease in gene expression. There were significant differences
  in expression of all genes by control and growth factors-treated THLE-3 cells (p
  < 0.0001), HepG2 cells (p < 0.0001), C3A cells (p < 0.0001), and SNU-449 cells (p
  < 0.0001). Differences with a p-value ≤ 0.05 were defined as statistically significant
  compared to the control group: one asterisk (*), p-value ≤ 0.05; two asterisks (**),
  p-value ≤  0.01; three asterisks (***), p-value ≤  0.001.'
