figure_title: NDUFS2 interact with OTUB1 in the mitochondrial death of pancreatic
  cancer
caption: 'A GO and KEGG pathway analysis after overexpression of NDUFS2. B The volcanic
  map depicting the dysfunctional genes in pancreatic cancer and the location of OTUB1
  and NDUFS2. C The correlation between OTUB1 and NDUFS2 was analyzed according to
  the TCGA database online (R = 0.42, P < 0.01). D The transcriptional expression
  of OTUB1 in pancreatic cancer. E The transcriptional expression of NDUFS2 in pancreatic
  cancer. F The expression of OTUB1 and NDUFS2 in pancreatic cancer and normal control.
  G Confocal analysis shows the expression of OTUB1 and NDUFS2 in in pancreatic cancer
  and normal control (Scale bar: 10 μm; magnification: ×100). H Western blotting detecting
  the expression of NDUFS2 when upregulated OTUB1 expression in Panc05.04 cells. I
  Western blotting detecting the expression of NDUFS2 when transfected with OE-NDUFS2
  and control plasmids in Panc05.04 cells. J Western blotting detecting the expression
  of NDUFS2 when transfected with sh-OTUB1 and control plasmids in Panc05.04 cells.
  K Western blotting detecting the expression of NDUFS2 when transfected with sh-OTUB1
  and control plasmids in ASPC-1 cells.'
