caption: Methylation analysis of promoter regions of the Keap1 /Nrf2 signaling pathway-related
  genes before and after treatment. (A) Methylation prediction of promoter regions
  of genes related to the Keap1 /Nrf2 signaling pathway, Methylation analysis of promoter
  regions of (B) keap1 and nrf2, (C) Mafg2, Mafk, and Maft. Each cycle is a CpG in
  the DNA sequence represented by either a closed circle (methylated cytosine) or
  an open circle (unmethylated cytosines). Each column of CpGs represents one colony
  sequenced, with a total of 10 positive clones.
