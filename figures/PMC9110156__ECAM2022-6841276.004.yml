caption: 'SOX9 knockdown suppressed TGF-β1/Samd3 pathway activation. (a, c, e) Western
  blot and qRT-PCR evaluated siRNA transfection efficiency, and bar graphs presented
  fold changes of SOX9 expression. GAPDH was used as a loading control (n = 3). (b,
  d, f) Western blot and qRT-PCR analysed the effect of SOX9-Homo-905 siRNA on SOX9
  administrated by TGF-β1. (g, h) The effect of knockdown of SOX9 on the expression
  of TGF-β1 and Smad3 and the level of Smad3 phosphorylation in the presence of TGF-β1
  were detected by western blot. (i, j) The fold changes of TGF-β1 and P-Smad3/Smad
  were presented by bar graphs. GAPDH was used as a loading control (n = 3). Data
  were presented as mean ± SEM. ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01 vs. Control + NC; #p < 0.05
  vs. TGF-β1 + NC.'
