caption: MA attenuates the inflammatory effects induced by LPS through the NLRP3/IL-1β
  signaling pathway by activating the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway. Cells were first transfected
  with siRNA for 48 h, followed by treatment with 100 mg/L MA for 12 h or 10μM NAC
  for 30 min, and finally treated with 1mg/L LPS for 24 h. (a) qRT-PCR was performed
  to evaluate the mRNA expressions of Nrf2 after siRNA treatment. (b) Western blot
  was performed to detect the protein levels of Nrf2 after siRNA treatment. (c) qRT-PCR
  was performed to evaluate the mRNA expressions of NLRP3 and IL-1β after siRNA treatment.
  (d) Western blot was performed to detect the protein levels of NLRP3 and IL-1β after
  siRNA treatment. (e) ELISA was conducted to detect the levels of IL-1β inflammatory
  cytokines after siRNA treatment. (f) qRT-PCR was performed to evaluate the mRNA
  expressions of Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 after siRNA treatment. (g) Western blot was
  performed to detect the protein levels of Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 after siRNA treatment.
  (h) MDA concentration was analyzed with 2-thiobarbituric and the activities of antioxidant
  enzymes including SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT were determined using ELISA kits. (i) The
  level of intracellular ROS was measured by DCF fluorescence using an enzyme marker
  after siRNA treatment. Data are shown as mean ± SEM obtained from three independent
  experiments. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
