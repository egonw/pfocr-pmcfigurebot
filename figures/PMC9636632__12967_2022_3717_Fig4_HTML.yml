caption: Metabolic profiles in the kidney and serum in DKD. The score plot of Orthogonal
  projections to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) for distinguishing
  metabolites in the kidney (A) and serum (D) between the DKD and CT groups. The OPLS-DA
  model for distinguishing metabolites in the kidney (B) and serum (E) between the
  DKD and CT groups. The upset plot for differentially expressed metabolites in the
  kidney (C) and serum (F) between the DKD and CT groups. Bubble plot for Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis in the kidney (G) and serum
  (H) (P < 0.05). The differentially activated KEGG pathways between the DKD and CT
  groups in the kidney (I) and serum (J). The red and blue bands represent the upregulated
  and downregulated pathways, respectively (moderated t-test, P < 0.05, |t value|> 2)
