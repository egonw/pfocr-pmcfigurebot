caption: 'Functional assessment of the retinal alterations in APP/PS1 mice. (A) Representative
  a– and b–waveforms of scotopic ERG recorded from 3 and 12 month old WT and TG female
  mice (F). (A2: enlargement corresponding to the 2nd WT/TG ERG traces example, i.e.,
  2nd line in the 3 Months row for the indicated light intensity) Scotopic ERG representative
  data of 3 month old WT and TG F–mice in response to a flash stimulation at 0.32
  Cd.s/m2. (A5: corresponding to the 5th WT/TG ERG traces example, i.e., 1st line
  in the 12 Months row for the indicated light intensity) Scotopic ERG representative
  data of 12 month old WT and TG F–mice in response to a flash stimulation at 0.04
  Cd.s/m2 (B,C) WT (white bars) and TG APP/PS1 (black bars) mice ERG, in response
  to 0.04; 0.32; 3.19 and 8 Cd.s/m2 light stimulus intensities corresponding to the
  rod photoreceptors a–wave amplitude quantification. (D,E) Inner retinal function
  assessment by b–wave amplitude quantification. (F) Representative of photopic ERG
  recorded from 3 and 12 month old WT and TG F-mice. (F’): Photopic ERG representative
  recorded of 12 month old WT and TG mice. (G) WT (white bars) and TG APP/PS1 (black
  bars) mice photopic ERG, corresponding to the cone photoreceptors recorded. For
  scotopic and photopic ERG recordings, a total of n= 15 WT (n= 7 males (M) + 8F)
  and n = 13 TG APP/PS1 (n= 6M + 7F) were used. Mice from the WT and TG cohort were
  used at between 3–4 months (n= 7M + 8F WT and n = 6M + 7F TG) and at 9 months (n=
  4M + 4F WT and n = 3M + 3F TG) or 12 months (n= 3M + 4F WT and n= 3M + 4F TG). Results
  are expressed as mean +/− SEM. WT= non-transgenic, wild-type; TG= transgenic APP/PS1.
