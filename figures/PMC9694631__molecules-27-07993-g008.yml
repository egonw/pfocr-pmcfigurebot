caption: Effect of the CM derivative on LDH release and activation of the necro-apoptotic
  pathway. (A) Evaluation of LDH release before and after treatment with the IC50
  of the CM derivative in HepG2 and A549 cancer cells. (B) Representative western
  blots of RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL proteins in HepG2 and A549 cancer cells treated
  with the IC 50 concentration of the CM derivative. β-actin was used as internal
  loading control. (C) Expression of proteins in HepG2 and A549 treated cells was
  expressed relative to untreated cells after normalization to the corresponding β-actin
  protein expression. Bars represent mean ± SD. Significant difference was analyzed
  by two-way ANOVA test, where, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, compared to untreated
  cells.
