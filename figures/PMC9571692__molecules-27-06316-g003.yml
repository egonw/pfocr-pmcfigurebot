caption: 'Anti-inflammatory pathway of pterostilbene: PTS mediates its anti-inflammatory
  effect mainly through the inhibition of the transcription factors NFκB and AP-1,
  which leads to the attenuation of downstream pro-inflammatory mediators, including
  TNF-α. Further, PTS also inhibits P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling
  and prevents the induction of iNOS and COX-2.'
