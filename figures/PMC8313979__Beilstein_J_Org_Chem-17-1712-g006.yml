caption: 'Basal breast cancer signaling pathway enrichments and glycogene connections.
  a) TF-to-glycogene communities in basal breast cancer: Three large TF-to-glycogene
  communities were discovered in the basal breast subnetwork. Community 1 has TFs
  enriched to chromatin-modifying enzymes, and community 2 has TFs enriched to interferon
  α/β/γ signaling. Community 3 did not have any signaling pathways enriched. b) Signaling
  pathway enrichment analysis for basal breast cancer: Connections between signaling
  pathways and TFs found to be statistically significant for basal breast cancer.
  TFs displayed have been enriched to the displayed glycosylation pathways using Fisher''s
  exact test.'
