caption: 'IL-4Rα deficiency alters neuronal transcriptome. (A and B) BaseScope for
  il4ra exon 7 mRNA shows widespread cortical expression of il4ra, which is (B) almost
  completely abolished in il4rafl/fl.Syn cre+ littermates. Scale bars = 50 µm. Representative
  images of three independent experiments. (C) IL-4–induced phosphorylation of ERK
  in WT cortical neurons (quantification of representative of three independent experiments
  [n = 5 per group]; mean ± SEM). (D) RNAseq on il4rafl/fl.Syn cre mice shows differential
  gene expression in cre+ neurons compared with cre− controls (Volcano plot, n = 3–4
  mice per genotype, 12- to 16-wk-old littermates). (E) Top 10 upregulated and downregulated
  GO terms. (F and G) Heatmaps of GO terms related to synapse organization (GO: 0050808)
  and synaptic vesicle cycle (GO: 0099504) showing the regulation of synaptic genes
  (arrows). (H) GO term for glutamatergic synaptic transmission (GO: 0051966) showing
  differential regulation of glutamatergic receptor components (arrows). (I) GO term
  for GABAergic synaptic transmission (GO: 0051932) showing differential expression
  of GABAergic receptors (arrows). (J) KEGG pathway for PKC and MAPK/ERK signaling.
