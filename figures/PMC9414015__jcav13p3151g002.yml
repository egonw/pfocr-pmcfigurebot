caption: Lycorine inhibited phosphorylation p65 and IκB degradation. (A, B) Lycorine
  inhibited p65 and IκB phosphorylation. Prostate cells DU145 and PC3 cells were treated
  or untreated with TNF-α (20 ng/ml) for 30 min. After that, the cells were treated
  or untreated with Lycorine at final concentration as indicated for 12 h. Then cells
  were left untreated or exposed to Whole-cell extracts were prepared and analyzed
  by Western blot analysis using the indicated antibodies. (C) Lycorine inhibited
  p65 nuclear translocation in PC3 cells. PC3 cells were treated or untreated with
  TNF-α for 30 min, and then exposed to DMSO, lycorine or TPCA-1. Cytoplasmic and
  nuclear extracts representing equal numbers of cells were analyzed by Western blot
  with the indicated antibodies. (D) Lycorine inhibited p65 expression in PC3 cells
  via immunofluorescence. After treating with TNF-α for 30 min, PC3 cells were treated
  with DMSO, lycorine (5 µmol/L, 10 µmol/L) or TPCA-1. Immunostaining was performed
  with specific mouse anti-p65 antibody followed by Cy3-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit
  immunoglobulins (red) immediately after the treatment.
