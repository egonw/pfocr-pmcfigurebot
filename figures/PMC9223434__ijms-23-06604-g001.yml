caption: Schematic diagram of the p53 signaling pathway model []. The model involves
  two-compartmental kinetics of p53 protein, its primary inhibitor Mdm2, phosphatase
  PTEN, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PIP3) and Akt kinase and is activated by
  IR radiation, which leads to DNA damage (). The N index stands for nuclear concentrations
  and P for phosphorylated molecules. Solid lines represent direct interactions in
  the model, such as production, degradation (deg) or state change (e.g., phosphorylated/nonphosphorylated)
  of selected molecules. Dashed lines represent indirect interactions, such as the
  catalysis of reactions or regulation of gene expression.
