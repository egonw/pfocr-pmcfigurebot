caption: Lignin synthesis and degradation pathways. (a) Schematics for the polymerization
  of monolignols (left) into polymeric lignin (center) followed by its depolymerization
  into model monomeric aromatic products (right). (b) Catabolic pathways of model
  depolymerization products in P. putida. The known reaction catalyzed by VanAB is
  marked with solid arrows. Potential reactions for the conversion of syringic acid
  into gallic acid using VanAB are shown using dashed arrows. (c) The native P. putida
  catabolic pathway for gallic acid through the intermediates, including 4‐oxalomesaconic
  acid (OMA) keto and enol forms, and 4‐carboxy‐4‐hydroxy‐2‐oxoadipic acid (CHA).
  Enzymes, gallic acid dioxygenase (GllA), OMA keto–enol tautomerase (GllD), OMAenol
  hydratase (GllB), and CHA aldolase (GllC).
