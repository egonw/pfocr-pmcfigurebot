caption: Effects of 5-ATAN on the mitochondrial pathway and cell cycle checkpoint
  protein expression in PC-3 cells. Cells were treated with various concentrations
  of 5-ATAN for 48 h or 10 µM of 5-ATAN for different time periods. (A) Caspase-3
  activity. (B) Mitochondrial membrane potential was then analyzed by flow cytometry.
  (C,D) Data were expressed as mean ± SD of three determinations presented in the
  bar graph and analyzed statistically using ANOVA and Duncan’s test. Different letters
  represent statistical differences among treatments, p < 0.05. The protein expression
  of (E) Bcl-xL and Bax, (F) Cdc25c, Cyclin B1, and Cdc2 were analyzed by Western
  blot.
