caption: Klotho siRNA transfection efficiency in UDSCs. (A,B) UDSCs were treated with
  various concentrations of transfection reagent (TR) and Klotho siRNA. The transfection
  efficiency was evaluated using real-time PCR and Western blotting. Universal negative
  siRNA control was used as a transfection control. (C) UDSCs were treated with 0.2%
  transfection reagent and 10 nM Klotho siRNA for 48 h. The morphological changes
  were observed using a microscope. (a) Normal UDSCs, and (b) si-Klotho UDSCs. (D)
  Klotho expression was visualized by fluorescence staining (green) in normal and
  si-Klotho UDSCs. The results are shown as the mean ± SEM. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001
  vs. Control.
