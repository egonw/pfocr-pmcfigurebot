caption: AIL induced cycle arrest in G2/M phase in Cal-27 cells, however, did not
  have any influence on TCA8113 cells. (a-b) Flow cytometry analysis of the cell cycle
  distribution changes in Cal-27 cells subjected to AIL treatment or otherwise. ∗P
  < 0.05, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, compared with the control. (c-d) Western blotting analysis
  of the levels of CDK1 and Cyclin B1 in Cal-27 cells treated with or without AIL.
