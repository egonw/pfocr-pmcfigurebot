caption: P301S inhibits binding of nuclear factor‐erythroid 2–related factor 2 (NRF2)
  to the promoter elements of several synaptic proteins. (A–C) Overexpressing P301S
  decreased the binding of NRF2 to the promoter regions of DLG2 (A), DLG4 (B) and
  SYN1 (C) genes in N2a cells, as measured by chromosome immunoprecipitation (ChIP).
  Unpaired t‐test, [DLG2] t = 4.888 df = 4, p = .0081; [DLG4] t = 3.899 df = 4, p
  = .0176; [SYN1] t = 2.842 df = 4, p = .0468; n = 3. (D, F and H) Diagrams show the
  predicted anti‐oxidative response element (ARE) for NRF2 binding in the promoter
  (−2000 ± 200 bp) of DLG2 (D), DLG4 (F) and SYN1 (H) genes. (E, G and I) The AREs
  or the mutated (MUT) AREs plasmids of DLG2 (E), DLG4 (G) and SYN1 (I) genes were
  co‐transfected with P301S or its empty vector (VEC) into HEK293 cells for 24 h,
  and then the luciferase activity was measured. (E) Unpaired t‐test, [DLG2] t = 3.89
  df = 4, p = .0177; [ARE1] t = 3.603 df = 4, p = .0227. (G) Unpaired t‐test, [DLG4]
  t = 4.587 df = 4, p = .0101; [ARE1] t = 4.160 df = 4, p = .0141. (I) Unpaired t‐test,
  [SYN1] t = 4.279 df = 4, p = .0129; [ARE3] t = 4.118 df = 4, p = .0146; n = 3. *p
  < .05, **p < .01. Data were presented as mean ± SEM.
