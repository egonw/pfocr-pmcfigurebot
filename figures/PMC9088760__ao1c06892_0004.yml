caption: 'Western blotting and qRT-PCR analyses of the expression levels of osteogenic
  proteins and osteogenic genes after 7 days of incubation of BMSCs with GOQDs at
  different concentrations. (A) Expression levels of related proteins analyzed by
  western blotting; (B–D) quantitative analyses of β-catenin, Runt-related transcription
  factor 2 (RUNX2), and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) protein expression; and
  (E–H) expression levels of osteogenic genes β-catenin, osteocalcin (OCN), BMP2,
  and RUNX2 in BMSCs tested by qRT-PCR (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001, compared
  with 0.1 μg/mL GOQDs; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, and ###p < 0.001, compared with control).'
