caption: The WGCNA analysis of mutant Î”Qrr5 during the infection period compared to
  wild-type strain by RNA-Seq. (a) Hierarchical cluster tree showing eleven modules
  of co-expressed genes. Each of the genes is represented by a leaf in the tree, and
  each of the eleven modules by a major tree branch. (b) Module-Qrr5 -expression/times
  correlations and corresponding P-values. (c) The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
  results of the turquoise module where Qrr5 is located by WGCNA. (d) The co-expression
  network of related genes is regulated by Qrr5. (The red dot was the T3SS1 gene).
