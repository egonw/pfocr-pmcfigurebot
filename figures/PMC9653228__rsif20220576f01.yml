caption: (a) Schematic of the experimental set-up. Poly-acrylic acid/rhodamine functionalized
  MNP with an Fe2O3 core was synthesized and incubated with PC12 cells to allow internalization.
  (b) The MNP-tagged cells were cultured in differentiation media while being exposed
  to static magnetic fields in order to direct neurite extension along the magnetic
  field gradients. (c) MNP-tagged neurons were also injected into rat brain slices
  modelling the nigral-striatal pathway. Magnetic fields were then used to direct
  neurite extension from the cells at the injection site towards the striatum.
