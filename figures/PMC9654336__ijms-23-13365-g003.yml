caption: Temporal dynamics of sensitivity to MEK inhibition, ERK1/2 phosphorylation,
  and MEK/ERK responders’ expression during cell cycle progression. (A) Numbers of
  viable PEO4 cells enriched in different cell cycle phases after subsequent treatment
  with trametinib. Data are normalized to control samples and presented as mean ±
  SD. n = 3. * p < 0.05, Kruskal–Wallis H test). Aph—aphidicolin. (B) Dynamics of
  cell number reduction (after trametinib treatment), ERK1/2 phosphorylation (prior
  to trametinib addition), and COMS genes expression (prior to trametinib addition)
  across different stages of cell cycle. Data are normalized to “0 h” samples and
  presented as mean values. Relative pERK1/2 levels were calculated by normalization
  to total ERK1/2 levels.
