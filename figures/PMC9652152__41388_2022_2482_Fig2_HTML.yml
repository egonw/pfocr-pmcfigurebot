figure_title: Loss of INPPL1, PIK3R2 and TSC2 cause drug resistance through re-activation
  of PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway signaling
caption: A Bar chart of results from the competitive proliferation assay for INPPL1,
  TSC2 and PIK3R2 KO and vector control cells. Data are mean ± SD; n = 3. Statistical
  significance was determined using Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test (****p < 0.0001,
  ***p < 0.001). B Crystal violet staining of EVSA-T INPPL1, PIK3R2 and TSC2 KO cells
  treated with DMSO, 250 nM AZD8186 or 1 μM capivasertib for 10 days. Data are representative
  of three independent experiments. C Western blot analysis of PI3K pathway effectors
  (pAKT, pPRAS40, pS6, p4E-BP1) in EVSA-T INPPL1, TSC2 and PIK3R2 KO cells treated
  with AZD8186, capivasertib or DMSO control for 4 h. Data are representative of three
  independent experiments. D Control and KO cells as indicated were treated with AZD8186
  and capivasertib alone and with the addition of 1μM capivasertib, 100 nM Rapamycin,
  500 nM AZD2014 and 500 nM AZD8835 combinations. Data are representative of three
  independent experiments and two independent gRNAs. E, F Plates from (D) were quantified
  using ImageJ software and % confluency of each well calculated. Data are mean of
  3 independent experiments ± SD. All images shown are from the same blots at the
  same exposures, panels for each marker have been separated to aid visualisation,
  but images for each marker are comparable between KO cell lines and treatments.

  inhibitors in PTEN-null breast cancer and can be overcome by combining with Mcl-1
  inhibitors.
