caption: 'C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein-6 (CTRP6) protects against hypoxia/reoxygenation
  (H/R)-induced inflammation and oxidative damage via the sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) signaling
  pathway in vitro.(A, B) Sirt1 protein expression after CTRP6 treatment. *P < 0.05,
  vs. Sham group or control (Con) group; #P < 0.05, vs. I/R or H/R group. (C, D) Cell
  viability and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release after Ex527 treatment. (E, F)
  Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and nuclear factor (erythroid-2 related)
  factor 2 (Nrf2) transcriptional activity after Ex527 treatment. (G, H) Nuclear factor
  kappa B (NF-κB) transcriptional activity and Tnf-α mRNA level. (I) Caspase 3 activity
  after Ex527 treatment. For each experiment, six independent cortical neuron preparations
  were made per group. All data were normalized to the sham, control (Con), or Ad-control
  group. The results are presented as the mean ± SEM, and were analyzed by one-way
  analysis of variance followed by post hoc Tukey''s test. *P < 0.05. Ex527: A specific
  inhibitor of Sirt1; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; I/R: ischemia/reperfusion;
  Tnf-α: tumor necrosis factor-α.'
