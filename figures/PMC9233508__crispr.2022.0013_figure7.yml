caption: Phenotypes of edited mice. (A, B) Hyperoxaluric phenotype in Agxt1-edited
  mice. (A) Agxt1-edited mice harboring the precise deletion (del46) were analyzed
  and the absence of AGXT protein after gene editing was confirmed by Western blot
  of liver homogenates. (B) Histological analysis of Agxt1-edited mice subjected to
  a glyoxylate pathway challenge. Calcium oxalate crystal deposits were present in
  the kidneys of edited mice. (C, D) Anemic phenotype in Pklr-KO mice. (C) Reticulocyte
  analysis revealed a significant increase in reticulocytes in mice edited in both
  alleles (n = 4), in comparison with WT or heterozygous mice (***p < 0.0001). (D)
  Mice harboring precise deletion (del59/del59) in both alleles showed marked splenomegaly.
  WT and WT/del59 mice did not show any increase in spleen size. (E, F) Rasa1-deficient
  phenotype. (E) Mendelian distribution of the Rasa1 frameshift allele in newborns
  and e9.5 and e10.5 embryos. Newborns and embryos were analyzed by genomic PCR (n = 114
  and n = 38, respectively). (F) Morphological characterization of e9.5D and e10.5D
  edited embryos. Note distended pericardium (arrowhead) and reduced embryo size (note
  scale bar) in e9.5D embryos with homozygous deletion, compared with WT or heterozygous
  embryos. Most of the homozygous embryos were dead at e10.5d. WT, wild type.
