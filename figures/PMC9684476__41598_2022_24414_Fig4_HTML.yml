caption: 'Resveratrol inhibits serum-induced the activation of EphA2 in PC-3 cells.
  Cells were treated with serum with or without RES for 24 h. (A) The same amount
  of proteins (25–30 μg) were analyzed by Western blot using the phospho-EphA2 and
  EphA2 antibodies. As a loading control, β-actin was used. (B) The bands of proteins
  were quantified. Data present as the means ± SD of three independent experiments
  by analysis of Student’s t-test. ***p < 0.001 versus untreated control; #p < 0.05
  and ##p < 0.01 versus serum-treated control.'

  the EphA2/twist-VE-cadherin/AKT pathway in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells.
