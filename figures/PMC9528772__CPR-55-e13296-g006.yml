caption: Sirt6 deficiency exacerbates mitochondrial changes in Ang II‐infused mice.
  (A) Schematic diagram illustrating the generation of podocyte‐specific Sirt6‐KO
  mice. (B) Representative pictures of PCR confirmation of mouse genotypes. (C) Representative
  micrographs of PASM staining of glomerular structure from the indicated groups.
  Bar = 50 μm. (D) Electron microscope ultrastructural image of podocyte mitochondria
  from WT and KO Ang II‐infused mice at 4 weeks. Scale bars = 1 μm. (E and F) Average
  length and aspect ratio of podocyte mitochondria from saline‐ and Ang II‐infused
  mice at 4 weeks. (G and H) The oxidative stress level was measured with dihydroethidium.
  Scale bar = 15 μm. *p < 0.05, n = 5
article_title: Sirt6 deficiency contributes to mitochondrial fission and oxidative
  damage in podocytes via ROCK1‐Drp1 signalling pathway.
