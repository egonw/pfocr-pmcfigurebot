caption: 'iTRAQ results. (a) Protein quantitative results were analyzed by principal
  component analysis. The control group and the experimental group aggregated significantly
  into different clusters. Blue: control group; red: experiment group. Heatmap (b)
  and volcano plots (c) protein expression between the control and experimental groups
  (fold change > 1.5 and adjusted P value < 0.05). Red: upregulated; blue: downregulated.
  (d) GO enrichment analysis was performed for upregulated proteins. The results showed
  that the upregulated proteins are mainly involved in actin filament polymerization,
  focal adhesion, and actin binding. (e) GO enrichment analysis was performed for
  downregulated proteins. The results showed that the downregulated proteins are mainly
  involved in the protein activation cascade, blood microparticles, and antigen binding.
  (f) KEGG pathway analysis was performed for upregulated proteins. The results showed
  that the upregulated proteins are mainly involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton,
  platelet activation, pathogenic Escherichia coli infection, and tight junction.
  (g) KEGG pathway analysis was performed for downregulated proteins. The results
  showed that the downregulated proteins are mainly involved in complement and coagulation
  cascades, Staphylococcus aureus infection, prion disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus.'
