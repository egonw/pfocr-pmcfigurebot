caption: Validation of the effect of BMP2 on osteogenic differentiation in valvular
  interstitial cells. (a) Detection of BMP2 expression by western blotting after overexpression
  or knockdown of BMP2 in VICs. Quantitative analyses of the protein bands are shown
  on the right. (b) RUNX2, MST2, and OSTERIX expression were detected by western blotting
  analysis after overexpression or knockdown of BMP2 in VICs. Quantitative analyses
  of the protein bands are shown on the right. (c) Alizarin Red staining was conducted
  to detect the formation of calcium nodules after alterations in the level of BMP2.
  The quantitative analysis is shown on the right. Scale bar, 50 μm. (d) ALP activity
  was detected and quantitated by ALP staining assay after alterations in the level
  of BMP2. Scale bar, 200 μm. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001.

  by Inhibiting the BMP2 Signaling Pathway.
