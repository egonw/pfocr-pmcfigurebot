caption: SARS-CoV-2 activates CAD to promote replication. (A) Diagram of [15N-amide]glutamine
  tracing for the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway. (B) Caco-2 cells were infected
  with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI = 5) for 24 and 48 h. WCLs were analyzed by immunoblotting
  with indicated antibodies. (C) Caco-2 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI =
  5) for indicated hours, followed by labeling with [15N-amide]glutamine for 5 min
  (dihydroorotate) or 45 min (UMP, UDP, and UTP). Indicated metabolites were analyzed
  by LC-MS. (D and E) Caco-2 cells were infected with control lentivirus or that containing
  shRNA against CAD. Cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI = 1) for 96 h, followed
  by labeling with [15N-amide]glutamine for 5 min. WCLs were analyzed by immunoblotting
  with indicated antibodies (D), while dihydroorotate was analyzed by LC-MS (E). (F–H)
  Caco-2 cells were infected with control lentivirus or that containing shRNA against
  CAD. Cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI = 0.1) for the indicated time. WCLs
  were analyzed by immunoblotting with indicated antibodies (F). Total RNA was extracted
  at 72 hpi and analyzed by real-time PCR with primers specific for indicated viral
  genes (G), and viral titer was determined by plaque assay (H). Data are presented
  as means ± SD of biological triplicates (C, E, G, and H) and are representative
  of three independent experiments (B, D, and F). Statistical analysis was performed
  by the one-way ANOVA test. ***P < 0.001.
