caption: Carbohydrate metabolic pathways. (A) Starch biosynthesis and degradation
  pathway. (B) Sucrose biosynthesis and metabolism pathway. (C) Heatmap of DEGs of
  carbohydrate metabolic pathway. Responsive progression of genes expressions under
  different samples infection with PMV compared CK. Heat maps were drawn using the
  Log2 ratio (transformed FPKM value of PMV infection/those of CK). Detailed genes
  and expressions data were provided in , available as  online. WAXY, granule-bound
  starch synthase; GLGC, glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase; AMY, alpha-amylase;
  malZ, alpha-glucosidase; UDPG, UDP-glucose; ADPG, ADP-glucose; G1P, glucose-1P;
  F6P, fructose 6-phosphate; RS, raffinose synthase; SPS, sucrose phosphate synthase;
  SUS, sucrose synthase; S6P, sucrose-6-phosphate; HK, hexokinase; STS, stachyose
  synthase; UDPG, UDP-glucose; UDP-Gal, UDP-galactose; GOLS, galactinol synthase.
  Î±-GAL, alpha-galactosidase; INV, beta-fructofuranosidase. The heat maps indicated
  the upregulation (red) and downregulation (green) of genes in PMV-infected samples
  compared to CK.
