caption: Crosstalk between proteasome inhibitors and cardioprotection. Proteasome
  inhibitors either by NFκΒ activation or by a PP2A-dependent abrogation of Reperfusion
  Injury Salvage Kinase (RISK) pathway interfere with endogenous cardioprotective
  mechanisms. Arrows correspond to downstream activation and blunt lines to inhibitory
  effect, green arrows correspond to positive effects, and red arrows correspond to
  negative effects. A Gene, Apoptotic Gene; Akt, Protein kinase B; eNOS, endothelial
  nitric oxide synthase; ERK 1/2, Extracellular signal-regulated kinases; IKKa, inhibitor
  of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit alpha; LC3B, Microtubule-associated protein
  1A/1B-light chain 3B; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; NF-κB, nuclear factor
  kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; Raptor, Regulatory-associated protein
  of mTOR; PI3K, Phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A. Figure was
  constructed using images from Servier Medical Art by Servier.
