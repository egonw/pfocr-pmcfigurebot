caption: Establishment of an inchoate acute hepatic injury model and detection of
  ERS-related proteins. (A) Pathological changes of tissues of mice in the model group
  detected by H&E staining. (B) Levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase
  in the serum. (C) ERS-related protein expression detected by western blotting. SERP1
  expression in acute hepatic injury tissues detected by (D) immunohistochemistry
  and (E) western blotting. (F) SERP1 expression in acute hepatic injury cells detected
  by western blotting and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. *P<0.05, **P<0.01
  and ***P<0.001 vs. the control; n≥3. ERS, endoplasmic reticulum stress; SERP1, stress-associated
  endoplasmic reticulum protein 1; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase;
  LPS, lipopolysaccharide; D-GalN, D-galactosamine; GRP78, glucose-regulated protein
  78; GRP94, glucose-regulated protein 94.
