caption: 'Detoxification function of MUC5B-high tumor cells of cholangiocarcinoma.
  A: Top 50 enriched signaling pathways of the differentially expressed genes in MUC5B-high
  cells; B: Heatmap showing the relative activities of oxidation-related metabolic
  signaling pathways in MUC5B-high vs MUC5B-low cells; C: Violin plots showing relative
  expression levels of GSTA1, GSTA2, ALDH1A1, ALDH2, UCP2, and MUC5B in cholangiocarcinoma
  (CCA) tumor sub-clusters; D: Gene set enrichment analysis plot showing the enrichment
  of genes from MUC5B-high (left) and MUC5B-low (right) cells in the drug resistance
  signaling pathway. The P value and normalized enrichment score are indicated on
  the plot; E: Distribution of MUC5B and GSTA1 in the spatial transcriptomics (ST)
  slide. Zoomed in portions of the ST chip (middle) showing multiple areas of co-localization;
  F: Correlation analysis between the expression of MUC5B and ALDH1A1 (left), MUC5B
  and UCP2 (right) in CCA tumor samples from cohort 10.'
