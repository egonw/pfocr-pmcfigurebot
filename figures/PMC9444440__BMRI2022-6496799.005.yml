caption: 'Mutations in SLC26A4 suppress the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. The phosphorylated
  and total levels of PI3K, Akt, and mTOR were examined by Western blot. The ratios
  of p-PI3K/PI3K, p-Akt/Akt, and p-mTOR/mTOR were calculated. GAPDH served as an internal
  control. ##P < 0.01 compared to the vector group. ∗∗P < 0.01 compared to the wild-type
  group.'
