caption: Across species, mammals, birds, and fish have similar responses to stress
  induced changes in TRP-KYN metabolism. Stress responses include increased GC and
  catecholamine signaling, which elevate TRP metabolism through the KYN pathway, as
  indicated by the levels of downstream metabolites. While it is generally accepted
  that this occurs through hepatic TDO induction in mammals, the molecular mechanism
  is not yet clear in other vertebrate species. Figure created on biorender.com.
