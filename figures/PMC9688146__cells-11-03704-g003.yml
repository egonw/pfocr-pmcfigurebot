caption: PKG activation inhibits pro-coagulant platelet formation but not platelet
  apoptosis. Both procoagulant and apoptotic platelets formation at the end lead to
  platelet death. Procoagulant platelets are formed by strong agonists (thrombin plus
  collagen) that activate respective receptors which leads to sustain increase of
  intracellular calcium concentration and activation of TMEM16F and PS surface externalization.
  Activation of PKG by endogenous NO by different mechanisms inhibited increase of
  intracellular calcium concentration and procoagulant platelet formation. Bcl-2 mimetics
  induce platelet apoptosis by activation of caspases pathways; however, in contrast
  to procoagulant platelets, activation of PKG does not inhibit platelet apoptosis.
