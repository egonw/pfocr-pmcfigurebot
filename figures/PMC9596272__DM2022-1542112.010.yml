caption: 'Effect of DC-conditioned medium on STAT signaling in Th9 cells. Th9 cells
  were cultured with conditioned medium collected from unstimulated or IFN-γ-stimulated
  DCs. (a) Western blot of expression of p-STAT1, STAT1, p-STAT3, and STAT3 proteins
  in Th9 cultured with or without DC-conditioned medium for 20, 60, or 120 min. Quantification
  of phosphorylation levels of (b) STAT1 and (c) STAT3 relative to respective total
  protein content. Results are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3), ∗p < 0.05; #p < 0.05
  compared with the same group at 20 min; Δp < 0.05 compared with the same group at
  60 min. IFN: interferon; DCs: dendritic cells; STAT: signal transducer and activator
  of transcription.'
