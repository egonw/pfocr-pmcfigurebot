caption: 'Lp(a) is enriched in proteins associated with cholesterol metabolism and
  immune response. LDL and Lp(a) were isolated from the same 3 donors at 2 different
  time points and both sets were analyzed and relatively quantified using LC-MS/MS.
  After removing known contaminants, proteins identified with a confidence p-value
  > 0.05, and proteins not identified in all 3 donors, the first isolation yielded
  110 proteins and the second 39 proteins. For robustness, only the 11 proteins that
  were identified in both sets were further analyzed. (A) The fold differences were
  calculated as ratio of the average peak intensities of a protein in Lp(a) over that
  in LDL from the same donor and are presented as log2 of the fold differences. A
  log2 value higher than 1 means the protein was at least 2-fold more abundant in
  Lp(a) than in LDL of the same donor, a value smaller than -1 means the protein was
  at least 2-fold more abundant in LDL than in Lp(a). (B) Visualization of protein-protein
  interaction clusters of the 11 proteins by String analysis using only connections
  with high confidence (minimum required interaction score: 0.7). Red nodes belong
  to the KEGG pathway “Cholesterol metabolism” (hsa04979), blue nodes to the KEGG
  pathway “ Complement and coagulation cascades” (hsa04610). [ApoA4 (APOA4), apoC1
  (APOC1), apoC2 (APOC2), apoC3 (APOC3), apoC4 (APOC4), apoE (APOE), complement C3
  (C3), complement C4-A (C4A), apo(a) (LPA), serum paraoxonase/arylesterase 1 (PON1),
  alpha-1-antitrypsin (SERPINA1)].'
