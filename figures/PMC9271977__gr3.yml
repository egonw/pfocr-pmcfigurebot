caption: Molecular characterization of pharmacogenomic-based subtypes. (A) Heatmap
  representing MSigDb hallmark gene set QuSAGE activity scores for each subtype compared
  with all others. The higher the score, the higher the pathway activity. (B) Dot
  plot depicting normalized enrichment score (NES) of Reactome gene set. (C) Heatmap
  depicting representative pathways ssGSEA scores for each patient from the three
  subtypes. (D-K) Boxplots representing difference of inflammatory, proliferative,
  and metabolic signatures among subtypes in TCGA-LUAD (D), GSE72094 (E), GSE68465
  (F), GSE30219 (G), GSE42127 (H), GSE41271 (I), GSE31210 (J), GSE50081 (K) cohorts.
  P values are shown as *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001.
