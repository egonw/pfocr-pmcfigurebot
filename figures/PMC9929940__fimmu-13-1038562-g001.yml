caption: 'EDV-COVID-αGC formulation, antigen/αGC co-presentation and early cytokine
  response in mice. (A) Image of EDV-COVID-αGC depicting the LPS, membrane and nanocell
  contents including plac-CoV-2 plasmid, S-protein and αGC. (B) Construct: SARS-CoV-2
  S-protein nucleotide sequence (Genbank MN908947.3) at the 3′-end of a modified constitutive
  gene expression β-lactamase promoter and inserted between KpnI 5′ and SalI 3′ sites
  of the M13 multiple cloning site of pUC57-Kan backbone plasmid to create plac-CoV-2.
  (C) Western blot analysis using MAbs against the S1 and S2 subunit demonstrated
  the presence of the S-protein within EDV-COVID-αGC. (D) FACS analysis showing that
  EDV-COVID-αGC was able to effectively deliver αGC into murine bone marrow derived,
  JAWSII, cells and presented through CD1d-ligand to a similar efficiency as free
  αGC. (E) Co-staining of JAWSII cells with anti-CD1d:αGC and anti-spike Abs demonstrating
  αGC and S-protein delivery by EDVs with EDV-COVID-αGC delivering both S-protein
  and αGC on the same cell surface. (F–H) IFNα, IFNγ, IL-12-p40 levels at 8 h post
  dose 1 following I.M. injections of female BALB/c mice (n=6) with 2 and 3 (x 109)
  EDV-COVID-αGC or various controls. (I) IL-2 levels in 2 x 109 and 3 x 109 EDV-COVID-αGC
  particle dose after 8 h post dose 1. (J, K) TNFα and IL-6 levels in 2 x 109 and
  3 x 109 EDV-COVID-αGC or various controls 8h post dose 1. (L) IL-21 levels for 3
  x 109 dose measured at day 28. (M) IL-10 levels in 3 x 109 EDV-COVID-αGC particle
  dose after 8 h post dose 1. Units = pg/ml. Asterisks represent significant values
  (****p ≤ 0.0001; ***p ≤ 0.001; **p ≤ 0.01; *p ≤ 0.05) measured using two-way ANOVA
  and Tukey’s test or one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test (IL-2) on GraphPad Prism v 9.4.0.
