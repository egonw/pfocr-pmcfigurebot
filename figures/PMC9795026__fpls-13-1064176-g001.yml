caption: 'Overview of FA synthesis and TAG assembly in plants. The conversion of acetyl-CoA
  to malonyl-CoA by ACCase is the first committed step in fatty acid synthesis in
  plastids. With acetyl-CoA serving as the starting unit, the acyl chain is extended
  by sequential condensation of two-carbon units from malonyl-ACP by FAS complex.
  FAs exported from plastids enter the acyl-CoA pool in the ER and can be incorporated
  into PC, where acyl groups are modified and re-enter the acyl-CoA pool thorough
  acyl editing. The Kennedy pathway incorporates acyl-CoA into glycerolipids via sequential
  acylation of G3P by GPAT, LPAT and DGAT. TAG can be synthesized through acyl-CoA-dependent
  (DGAT converting DAG and acyl-CoA to TAG) and acyl-CoA-independent (PDAT synthesizing
  TAG from DAG and PC) pathways. TAGs are packaged into LDs and protected by LD-associated
  proteins. ACCase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; ACP, acyl carrier protein; CoA, coenzyme
