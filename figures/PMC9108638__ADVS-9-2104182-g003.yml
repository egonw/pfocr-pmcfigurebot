caption: 'A) CLSM images of 4T1 cells after incubation with FITC‐PPDA or FITC‐aPDA
  (scale bar: 50 µm). B) Cellular mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) quantitatively
  analyzed by flow cytometry, n = 3. C) CLSM Z‐stack images of 4T1 tumor spheroids
  after treatment with PPDA or aPDA for 12 h. Scale bar: 250 µm. D) Quantitative analysis
  of fluorescence intensity in panel (C) images by Image J, n = 3. E) Schematic illustration
  of PPDA adhesion mechanism. F) PAI of 4T1 tumor‐bearing mice after tail‐vein injection
  of PDA, P‐PDA, or PPDA, n = 4. G) Average tumor PA intensity measured at different
  time points after intravenous injection of NPs, n = 4. H) Ex vivo fluorescence images
  and I) quantitative analysis of fluorescence signals from major organs and tumors
  24 h post‐injection, n = 3. Data are expressed as the means ± SD. Statistical significance
  is defined as *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001 and ns represents
  no significant difference.'
