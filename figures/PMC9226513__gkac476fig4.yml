caption: Dynamic regulation of 2′-fucosyllactose biosynthesis. (A) Illustration of
  the modularized platform of de novo biosynthesis of 2′-fucosyllactose in B. subtilis.
  Module A (2′-fucosyllactose synthesis) incorporates modifications designed to divert
  carbon flux to 2′-fucosyllactose metabolic. Module B (GTP supply) provides cofactor
  GTP for producing 2′-fucosyllactose. Module C (Competitive pathway) is the endogenous
  pathways which competed with 2′-fucosyllactose synthesis module. FutC, α1,2-fucosyltransferase;
  Zwf, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; Pgi, phosphoglucose isomerase; ManA, mannose
  6-phosphate isomerase; ManB, phosphomannomutase; ManC, α-d-mannose 1-phosphate guanylyltransferase;
  PfkA, phosphofructokinase; Gmd, GDP-mannose 6-dehydrogenase; WcaG, GDP-L-fucose
  synthase, Gmk, guanylate kinase; Ndk, nucleoside diphosphate kinase; PPP, pentose
  phosphate pathway; GTP, guanosine 5′-triphosphate; GMP, guanosine 5′-monophosphate;
  GDP, guanosine 5′-diphosphate. (B) The OD600 and titer of the MT1 (manB and futC
  were driven by P43), MT2 (manB was driven by P43 and futC was controlled by Pveg34),
  MT3 (manB and futC were driven by Pveg34) under the different bioprocess, including
  single-switch control (0–12 h at 30°C and 12–60 h at 37°C), and constant temperature
  fermentation at 37°C. Data are presented as mean ± s.d. of three replicates.
