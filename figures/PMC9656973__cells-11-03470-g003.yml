caption: 'Visfatin regulated PDGF-C production in chondrosarcoma cells via the PI3K/Akt
  pathway. (a) JJ012 cells were incubated with visfatin for the indicated time intervals.
  PI3k and Akt phosphorylation was measured by Western blot; (b–e) cells were pretreated
  with Ly294002 (10 μM), wortmannin (10 μM), or an Akt1/2 inhibitor (10 μM) for 30
  min, or transfected with p85 and Akt siRNAs, then stimulated with visfatin for 24
  h. RT-qPCR and ELISA determined PDGF-C expression; (f) JJ012 cells were transfected
  with p85 or Akt siRNAs. Western blot detected p85 and Akt expression; (g) chondrosarcoma
  cells were pretreated with Ly294002 and wortmannin for 15 min, then stimulated with
  visfatin for 30 min to assess Akt phosphorylation. Quantitative results are expressed
  as means ± SD. Compared with the control group, * p-values < 0.05; compared with
  the visfatin-treated group, #p-values < 0.05.'
