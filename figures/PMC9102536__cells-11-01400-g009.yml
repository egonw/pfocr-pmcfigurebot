caption: 'IP3R2-mediated signaling pathway counterbalances disinhibition of PNs. (A)
  Representative IPSCs before (basal) and after the first (S1) and the second (S2)
  30 light pulses and merger of all IPSCs, in an IP3R2KO::SST-Cre mouse. Scale bar,
  50 ms, 10 pA. (B) Mean normalized IPSCs amplitude before and after the 30 light
  pulse stimulation in the IP3R2KO::SST-Cre mice (n = 22). (C) Quantification of the
  mean normalized IPSC amplitude during the 10 min after the first (S1) and second
  (S2) stimulation in the IP3R2KO::SST-Cre mice. Note that in IP3R2KO::SST-Cre mice
  the disinhibition of PNs is stronger compared to that observed in SST-Cre mice.
  * statistical comparison with basal conditions, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, paired
  t-test. # statistical comparison with values in SST-Cre mice, # p < 0.05, unpaired
  t-test.'
