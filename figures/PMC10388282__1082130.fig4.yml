caption: 'Increased ANKRD26 expression level enhances proliferation of granulocyte
  progenitors in a model of induced pluripotent stem cells, through an enhanced JAK/STAT
  pathway. CD34+CD43+ progenitors derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)
  from patients [ANK] and controls [C] were differentiated into granulocytes in the
  presence of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3)
  and stem cell factor (SCF). (A) ANKRD26 expression in CD34+CD43+ progenitors (n=4)
  and in CD11b+CD15+CD14- cells (n=6) derived from patients’ iPSC was increased when
  compared to that in controls. ANKRD26 transcript was normalized to PPIA. Results
  are shown as mean ± standard deviation, *P<0.05; **P<0.01; paired t test. (B) The
  number of patients’ granulocytic progenitors (CFU-G) derived from iPSC was significantly
  higher than the control, as assessed by methylcellulose assay. The averages of seven
  independent experiments are shown as mean ± standard deviation. **P<0.01; paired
  t test. (C) The proliferation rate was significantly increased at days 17, 20 and
  22 of culture for patients’ cells as compared to controls. The averages of four
  independent experiments are shown as the mean ± standard error of mean. *P<0.05;
  paired t test. (D) CD11b+CD15+CD14- cell frequency analyzed at days 21-23 reflected
  a delay in maturation for patients’ cells. Averages of 14 experiments for controls
  and ten for patients’ cells are shown as the mean ± standard error of mean. ***P<0.005,
  unpaired t test. (E) An RNA-sequencing assay was performed on CD43+CD11b+CD14- progenitors
  sorted at day 16 of culture. Seven downregulated and 24 upregulated genes in patients’
  cells (n=3 for each, ANK1 and ANK2) (P<1x10-5) were identified compared to controls
  (n=1 for C1 and C3, n=3 for C2). (F) Gene set enrichment analysis for the KEGG_JAK_STAT_signaling
  pathway and for the receptor signaling pathway via STAT (GO:0007259, GOBP_RECEPTOR_SIGNAL-ING_PATHWAY_VIA_STAT)
  in ANK versus control iPSC. NES: normalized enrichment score; FDR: false discovery
  rate.'
