caption: The NOD1/NF-κB signaling pathway was activated in the liver of piglets challenged
  with LPS. (A) Volcano plots of comparative RNA-seq data between the CON group and
  the LPS group. (B) GO analysis based on the RNA-seq in the biological process of
  differential transcripts. (C) Representative KEGG analysis with the transcript corresponding
  to different genes. (D) The mRNA levels of TLR4, MyD88, NOD1, RIPK2, NFKBIA, NF-κB
  p65 were evaluated by RT-qPCR. (E) Hepatic protein levels of NOD1, RIPK2, IκB-α,
  and P-p65 were assessed by western blot, quantified using ImageJ analysis, and normalized
  to β-actin. n = 4−6 per group. Results are showed as means with SEM represented
  by a vertical bar. * represents significant differences between the CON group and
  the LPS group; * p < 0.05, ** p< 0.01, *** p<0.001.
