caption: Contractile smooth muscle cell (SMC) clusters in the hypercholesterolemic
  PerkSMC+/+ mice activate Perk signaling. A, Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis
  of the DEGs identified the Top 25 up- and downregulated pathways altered specifically
  with loss of Perk signaling in contractile SMCs. B, Heatmap of the genes up- and
  downregulated in select pathways in contractile SMCs that are specifically altered
  due to deletion of Perk. C, Cholesterol-induced increases in expression and transcriptional
  activation of Klf4 are abrogated by Perk deletion in explanted PerkSMC−/− SMCs.
  D, Cholesterol-induced increased expression of the complement pathway components
  C1qa, C1qb, C3, and C4b in SMCs is abolished by the deletion of Perk. E, Perk deletion
  reduces migration of SMCs. F, The Ire1 arm of unfolded protein response is upregulated
  in PerkSMC−/− SMCs and is further activated by cholesterol treatment. G, Ribonuclear
  protein assembly associated genes are upregulated at baseline in PerkSMC−/− SMCs
  and show further activation with cholesterol exposure, and this increased expression
  is abrogated by the chemical inhibition of Ire by Kira6. All qPCR data were analyzed
  by Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn multiple comparisons test. Data are represented
  as mean±SD. HFD indicates hypercholesterolemia followed by high-fat diet.
