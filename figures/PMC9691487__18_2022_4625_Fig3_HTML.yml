caption: ATM SINT is the most efficient ATM variant in repairing lesions, as confirmed
  by the reduced type III foci number 24 h post drug. a Example of γH2AX foci staining
  pattern. b Quantitation of type III foci in all samples. The type III foci are suitable
  to DNA repair efficiency assessment, implying that the γH2AX foci decrement at 24 h
  indicates successful DNA repair. Type III foci statistically increased and decreased
  after bleomycin treatment and 24 h post drug, respectively, in WT hT cells. TD 3-52,
  TD 4-53 did not present a statistically decrease of type III foci, while only TD
  SINT and TD miniATM presented a significant decrease of foci number during the recovery.
  In UTD, bleomycin treatment did not affect the composition of type III foci. In
  fact, they showed the same number of foci in all three treatment conditions, indicating
  a persistence of unrepaired lesions and confirming a different pathway on H2AX phosphorylation
  in these cells. At least 300 nuclei from three independent experiments were counted
  for data processing. Red asterisks refer to intra sample comparison, while the black
  ones show the statistical comparison with the control cell line UTD (Welch’s ANOVA
  test). Graphs show mean with SEM
