caption: BRU reversed protein expressions of EMT-related markers in both HCT-116 and
  SW480 cells. Western blotting was performed to analyze the protein level of E-cadherin,
  Vimentin, N-cadherin, MMP9, and MMP2 in HCT-116 cells (a, b) and SW480 cells (c,
  d), and quantitative analysis was performed by the Image Lab software. All data
  were shown as mean ± SD from three independent trials (∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 vs.
  control).
