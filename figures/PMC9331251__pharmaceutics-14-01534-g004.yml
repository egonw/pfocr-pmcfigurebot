caption: P-DEA-CPT damaged the mitochondria, initiated the mitochondrial apoptosis
  pathway, and caused cancer cell death. (A) Intracellular ROS level, (B) mitochondrial
  membrane potential depolarization, (C) ATP generation, (D) caspase-9 expression,
  and (E) caspase-3 expression in 4T1 cells were determined after different treatments.
  (F) Cell viability of 4T1 cells after being treated with different CPT polymers
  for 48 h. (G) The mean value and representative images of apoptotic and necrotic
  4T1 cells induced by CPT polymers, as tested by flow cytometry. * p < 0.05, ** p
  < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, n.s. (no significance); mean Â± SD (n = 3).
