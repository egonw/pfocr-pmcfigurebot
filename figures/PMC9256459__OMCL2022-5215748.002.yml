caption: LINC00092 regulated BC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Following
  LINC00092 or sh-LINC00092 transfection, the LINC00092 expression in cells (a), cell
  viabilities (b), proliferation (c), migration (d), and invasion (e) were measured
  via qPCR, CCK-8 assay, colony formation assay, cell scratch assay, and two-chamber
  transwell assay, respectively. N = 3. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
