caption: Representation of pine defense response to pinewood nematode (PWN). Pattern-triggered
  immunity (PTI) is initiated after recognition of nematode-associated molecular patterns
  (NAMPs), such as BxCDP1, or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from damaged
  plant cells, by cell surface receptor-like kinases (RLKs) or receptor-like proteins
  (RLPs). PTI leads to a transcriptional reprograming of the plant cell, which includes
  the activation of hormone pathways, such as jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid
  (SA) pathways, the expression of pathogenesis-related genes (PR), genes involved
  in oxidative stress response, and genes encoding enzymes involved in the biosynthesis
  of secondary metabolites (terpenes and phenylpropanoids). In susceptible plants,
  it is possible that the activation of the SA pathway inhibits the JA pathway. PWN
  releases effectors, such as the apoplastic VAP1 and BxSapB1, that repress the plant
  defense response. These effectors may be recognized by resistance genes, whether
  directly or indirectly through the monitoring of a co-factor protein that is altered
  by the effector. Effectors can be recognized by cell surface receptors, when they
  are apoplastic, or internal nucleotide-binding/leucine-rich-repeat (NLR) receptors,
  when they are injected into the cytoplasm by the PWN. Recognition of effectors by
  resistance genes initiates a stronger and more sustained defense response, the effector-triggered
  immunity (ETI).
