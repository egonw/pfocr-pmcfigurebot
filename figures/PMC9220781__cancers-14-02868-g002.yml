caption: 'Proposed pathways for drug nanocarriers to enter solid tumors. (A) Paracellular
  process: in this pathway, drug nanocarriers passively enter the extracellular space
  of solid tumors through intercellular gaps with dimensions up to 2000 nm, which
  are very important in the EPR effect. (B) Transcellular process: drug nanocarriers
  in mature vessels without common gaps in solid tumors actively enter the extracellular
  space of the solid tumor through vesicles (endocytosis-exocytosis) and pores. The
  fenestrate pathway does not have a complete incision, and a diaphragm separates
  the internal space from the lumen of the vessel. In the linked vesicle path, interconnected
  vesicles cause the transfer of drug nanocarriers.'
