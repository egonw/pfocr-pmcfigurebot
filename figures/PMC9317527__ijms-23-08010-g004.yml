caption: 'Effects of acidic pH or presence of glucose degradation products (GDPs)
  in PD fluids on endothelial cells. (A) Significant IPA canonical pathways (Fisher’s
  exact test p < 0.05) with an activation z-score ≠ 0; modeled acidosis effect: single-chamber,
  icodextrin, and filter versus double-chamber PD fluid; modeled GDPs effect: single-chamber,
  double-chamber, and icodextrin versus filter PD fluid; size of the nodes indicates
  the p-value of enrichment of the pathway. The activation z-score is a calculated
  prediction of activation or inhibition of regulators based on relationships with
  dataset genes and direction of change of dataset genes. It represents the bias in
  gene regulation that predicts whether the upstream regulator exists in an activated
  or inactivated state. Red: predicted activation, blue: predicted inhibition. (B)
  Co-regulation analysis of proteins significantly regulated (LIMMA p < 0.05) in either
  of the comparisons (green and purple) or in both comparisons (light blue). Comparisons:
  GDPs containing PD fluid vs. GDP-free and acidic PD fluid vs. neutral pH, log2[fold
  change] > 0.5 (C,D). The modified IPA NRF2-mediated Oxidative Stress Response Pathway
  overlaid with significantly (Fisher’s exact p < 0.05) regulated proteins in the
  comparison of GDPs-containing PD fluids vs. GDP-free (C) and acidic PD fluids vs.
  neutral pH (D). Down-regulated genes are shown in green and up-regulated genes in
  red.'
