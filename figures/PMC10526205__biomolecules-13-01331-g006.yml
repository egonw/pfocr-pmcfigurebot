caption: HnRNP C is positively co-expressed with FOXM1 in cancers. (A) Expression
  levels of FOXM1 or hnRNP C (encoded by HNRNPC gene) in TCGA head and neck squamous
  cell carcinoma (HNSC) or normal tissues. (B) The correlations between FOXM1 and
  hnRNP C expression levels in TCGA cancers were analyzed in Timer2.0 online database.
  (C) The scatter plots show the correlations between FOXM1 and hnRNP C expression
  levels in HNSC or bladder carcinoma (BLCA). (D) The expression of FOXM1 protein
  was analyzed by Western blotting in CAL 27 cells with hnRNP C knockdown. (E) A model
  of the novel regulatory pathway of hnRNP C/FOXM1. FOXM1 exon 9 inclusion and FOXM1a
  expression are suppressed by hnRNP C, which promotes tumorigenesis. The original
  image of D can be found in .
