caption: 'Effects of Vitex on intracellular signalling proteins in human osteosarcoma
  cells. (A) The proteome profiler human phospho-kinase array contains 37 different
  kinases, including three references and two PBS negative control kinases. Red text:
  Proteins with large differences. (B) Vitex treatment shows the relative expression
  of the phosphorylation profiles of 37 different kinases. Double spots with large
  differences are marked with red rectangles. (C) Western blots of phospho-PRAS40
  (p-PRAS40), phospho-AKT (p-AKT), AKT, and β-actin levels. The percentage change
  is depicted in a bar graph. The amount of β-actin was detected as a loading control
  in the same sample. Asterisks indicate statistical significance (* p < 0.05); data
  represent the results of three experiments.'
