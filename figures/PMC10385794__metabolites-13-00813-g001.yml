caption: Coq9 is widely distributed in green plants. Amino acid sequences from two
  chlorophytes, three mosses, one liverwort, one lycophyte, one fern, one conifer,
  and fifty-three angiosperms were aligned using MAFFT. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic
  tree was constructed using IQ-TREE under the JTT + G4 model selected by ModelFinder.
  The tree was rooted using human COQ9 (NP_064708.1) and yeast Coq9 (QHB10353.1) as
  an outgroup. Black circles are used to represent bootstrap values over 90%, and
  grey circles are used represent bootstrap values between 70% and 90%.
