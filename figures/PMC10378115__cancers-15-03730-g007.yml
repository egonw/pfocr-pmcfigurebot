caption: 'BLCA sensitivity to paclitaxel is independent of p53 activity but highly
  dependent on the expression of ATM and PPARG. (A) PRISM analysis for the sensitivity
  of BLCA cells to paclitaxel (log2 fold change in abundance of barcoded cells at
  d5 vs. d0) plotted against the expression of TP53 mRNA (log2 TPM + 1). (B) BLCA
  cell lines in PRISM analysis were grouped based on their TP53 (mutational or not)
  status, and the median sensitivity to paclitaxel was plotted. (C) PRISM analysis
  for the sensitivity of BLCA cells to paclitaxel (log2 fold change in abundance of
  barcoded cells at d5 vs. d0) plotted against the expression of ATM mRNA (log2 TPM
  + 1). (D) Two-class comparison of the CHRONOS score for PPARG between DepMap BLCA
  cell lines (n = 32) and all other cell lines in the database (n = 1063). (E) Normalized
  ATAC-seq. tracks of the PPARG gene locus in seven representative samples from various
  cancer types predicted to be dependent on PPARG and sensitive to paclitaxel (also,
  see B and A). Kidney cancer is used as a negative control. FC: Fold Change.'
