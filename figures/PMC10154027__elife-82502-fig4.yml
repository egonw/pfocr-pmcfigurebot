figure_title: Co-occurrence of odorous molecules in natural substances is explained
  by the principal odor map (POM)
caption: (a) We compiled a dataset of 214 molecules found in 303 essential oils and
  computed their pairwise POM distance (red) and count-based fingerprint (cFP) edit
  distance (blue), where molecule pairs that co-occur in the same essential oil are
  indicated by dark boxes. (b) To make POM and cFP edit distance comparable, we sort
  both POM and cFP edit distances for all 22,791 molecular pairs in the dataset from
  small to large and mark co-occurring pairs with dark lines; we then (c) plot the
  average shift in distance rank (relative to a random pair) for co-occurring (left)
  and non-co-occurring (right) molecule pairs under POM distance (red), cFP edit distance
  (blue), and Tanimoto distance (purple). As expected, the co-occurring pairs have
  a smaller rank (nearer together), and non-co-occurring pairs have a higher rank
  (further apart). More importantly, this rank shift for co-occurring molecules is
  ~2Ã— larger in POM than for structures distance (paired t-test, p<0.0001) and reversed
  for non-co-occurring pairs (paired t-test, p<0.001). Error bar indicates the 95%
  CI. (d) Two example pairs of co-occurring molecules that POM successfully recognizes
  as closely related while conventional structure-based distance fails. Common odor
  labels for the two molecules as predicted by a state-of-the-art model (). (e) The
  terpenoid biosynthesis pathway shows that these molecule pairs (red) are close downstream
  metabolic products of geranyl diphosphate (), explaining both their co-occurrence
  and their proximity in the POM despite their dissimilar structures.
