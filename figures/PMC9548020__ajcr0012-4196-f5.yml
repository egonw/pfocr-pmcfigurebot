caption: Characterization of sensitivity to the treatment of tumor stem cells. The
  tumor microenvironment has a high level of cellular heterogeneity. Our work identified
  and separated tumor stem cells (HNCSCs) from non-stem tumor cells (non-HNCSCs) using
  the CD44, CD117, CD133 or ALDH markers. We suggest that the up-regulation of these
  genes in cancer stem cells may be associated with HIF-1A-dependent KRAS downstream
  signaling by different types of EGFR mutations and crosstalk with TRKB in head and
  neck cancer. It is known that gene expression is extremely variable among the tumor
  subsets of HNC. Limitations of our study were the small sample size and the difficulties
  maintaining the tumor stem cells in primary tumors due to their extreme fragility.
  When comparing these two cell lines, we found that HNCSCs are more sensitive to
  the combination of drugs with Cetuximab plus Paclitaxel which can be justified by
  the high expression of EGFR and KRAS in this cell line (HNCSCs).
