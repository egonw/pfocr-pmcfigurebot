caption: In situ study using immunocytochemistry and immunofluorescence assay to investigate
  the impact of D5 treatment on silencing NF-κB signaling pathway in LPS-Stimulated
  astrocyte (SVG) and microglia (CHME3) cell lines:(A–D,J–M) Representative images
  of hematoxylin/DAB immunocytochemistry study of the D5 and ASA treatments roles
  on silencing NF-κB signaling pathway in LPS-Stimulated astrocyte (SVG) and microglia
  (CHME3) cell lines. Images are shown at 400-fold magnification. The in situ study
  demonstrated the impact of D5 compared to ASA on the decomposition of NF-κB complex,
  induced by LPS in the cytosol and subcellular localization of phospho-IκB-α S32.
  DAB-labeled HRP against Anti-Phospho-I B alpha (S32) Rabbit Monoclonal Antibody
  was used to produce brown dots in the peripheral cytoplasm to nuclei (depicted by
  red arrows in the ICC images), counterstained with Hematoxylin to form dark-blue-to-black
  stains in control groups of astrocyte (A) and microglia cells (J). In the LPS-stimulated
  astrocyte (B) and microglia (K) groups, phospho-I B alpha(S32) subunit immunoreactivities
  were shown in the cytosol. ASA and D4 treatments significantly protect the IκB-α
  subunit from phosphorylation and keep the NF-κB complex, in the cytosol of astrocytic
  glial and microglial cells, in its inactive form ((G,H) and (P,Q), respectively).
  The level of activated NF-κB-p65 inside the nucleus was measured using a fluorescent-tagged
  mouse monoclonal NF-κB p65 antibody. The high level of fluorescent signal in the
  nucleolus of cells is an indicator of the phosphorylation of the IκB-α subunit,
  breakage of NF-κB complex in the cytosol, activation, translocation of the NF-κB
  into the nucleus, and binding to chromosomal DNA, resulting in the gene expression
  of various pro-inflammatory cytokines. The immunofluorescence assay of the activated
  NF-κB-p65 nuclear translocation in both drug-pre-treated SVG and CHME3 cells stimulated
  with LPS was performed using a 5 µg/mL mouse monoclonal NF-κB p65 antibody (Thermo-Fisher,
  Poland) and 10 µg/mL goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor488 (Thermo-Fisher, Poland)
  as the primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. The fluorescent signals in
  samples were obtained from the complex of NF-κB p65 antibody-IgG Alexa Flour488
  (the green dots in cytoplasm and nuclei), and nuclear counter stain DAPI (the blue
  channel signals in the control microglia and astrocyte groups) ((E–H) for SVG and
  (N–Q) for CHME3 cells). It is observed that 60 min after LPS stimulation of pre-treated
  CHME3 and SVG cells, the density of the green signal increased in the nuclei of
  cells, suggesting the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus. The images were quantified
  using Cell profiler software, and data are presented as the ratio of the green fluorescent
  density between cytoplasm and nuclei of cells (I-1,I-2). * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01
  probability. The image scale is 50 µm.
