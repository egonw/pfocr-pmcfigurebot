caption: Effect of realgar on APL cell cycle arrest. (A) (a) Control, (b) 12.5 μg/mL,
  (c) 25.0 μg/mL, (d) 50.0 μg/mL, and (e) 75.0 μg/ml. The statistical data were generated
  by flow cytometry software and plotted as generated. (B) Histogram analysis of cell
  cycle phase distributions of NB4 cells after treatments with 0, 12.5, 25.0, 50.0
  and 75.0 μg/mL of realgar. Data were obtained from three independent experiments
  and are presented as the mean ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001.
