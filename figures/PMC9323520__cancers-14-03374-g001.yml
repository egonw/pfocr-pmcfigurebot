caption: 'Inhibition of mTORC1 signaling in resistant tumors reveals an association
  with the extracellular matrix. (A) Relative growth inhibition of breast cancer cell
  lines in response to 1 μM rapamycin after 3 days of treatment. Each cell line was
  compared to their vehicle (DMSO) control (set to 1, not shown). Data is expressed
  as average ± STDEV (* = p < 0.05 compared to ZR-75-1 cells); n = 3 independent experiments
  in triplicate. Different colors represent different receptor-defined subtypes: red,
  ER+/PR+/HER2-, green, ER+/PR+/HER2+, orange, ER-/PR-/HER2+, blue, ER-/PR-/HER2-.
  (B) Representative western blots examining levels of phosphorylated S6 (pS6 S235/236),
  total S6 (S6), and vinculin (loading control); the quantitation of the pS6 to S6
  ratio is shown. Total protein loading is shown in . Numbers indicate different tumors.
  Reactome pathway enrichment analysis of the (C) differentially up- and (D) down-regulated
  genes in MDA-MB-231 xenografted tumors following 3 days of rapamycin treatment.
  (E) Heatmap and (F) GSEA plot of differentially expressed genes (FDR < 0.5) in the
  reactome pathway: extracellular matrix organization. (G) Confirmation of gene expression
  changes for FN1, COL8A2, COL7A1, and TNC in MDA-MB-231 orthotopic xenografts in
  response to rapamycin. Data are expressed as average ± SD (* = p < 0.05 compared
  to respective vehicle); n = 4 independent tumors.'
