caption: Significantly enriched biological pathways(A–C) Selected groups of enriched
  biological pathways (q ≤ 0.5) for pairwise comparisons among CTRL, PD, and T2D,
  specifically, (A) PD-CTRL, (B) T2D-CTRL, and (C) T2D-PD. Colored triangles indicate
  statistical significance (q < 0.05) and direction. Rows represent pathways, panels
  represent pairwise comparisons, and columns within panels represent tissues. The
  database of origin for each pathway is noted with a suffix R or K for Reactome or
  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), respectively. GP1b-IX-V, glycoprotein
  Ib-IX-V; SREBP, sterol regulatory element binding protein.
