caption: 'Chlorogenic acid downregulated the expression of core targets in the TNF
  signaling pathway. BV-2 cells were exposed to LPS (1 μg·ml-1) for 24 h with or without
  CGA pretreatment for 24 h. (A–G) Western blotting analysis of the protein expression
  of p-Akt1, Akt1, p-NF-κB, NF-κB, p-p38, p38, p-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, PTGS2, and TNF-α.
  **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 vs. the control group, #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 vs. the LPS
  group.(n=5).'
