caption: EMD activated the MAPK signaling pathways in DPSCs. (a) Protein expression
  levels of JNK, p-JNK, p38 MAPK, p-p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, and p-ERK1/2 in EMD-treated
  DPSCs were detected by western blot analysis at different time points (0, 5, 10,
  30, 60, and 120 min). (b) DPSCs were pretreated with specific pathway inhibitors
  (SP600125 targeting JNK, SB203580 targeting p38 MAPK, and U0126 targeting ERK) for
  1 h and then stimulated with EMD. SP600125 and U0126 group were stimulated for 10 min,
  and SB203580 group was stimulated for 5 min. The effectiveness of the inhibitors
  was verified by western blot assay. Quantification was done by Image Lab™ software.
  The results are presented as means ± SD of three independent experiments (n =3).
