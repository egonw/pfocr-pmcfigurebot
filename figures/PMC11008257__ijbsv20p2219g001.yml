caption: The expression level of NUP85 is increased in the liver of NAFLD patients
  and model mice. A. Human liver tissues stained with HE. B. Expression levels of
  NUP85 in liver of healthy people and NAFLD patients. C-D. RT-qPCR and Western blotting
  were used to detect the expression level of NUP85. E. Oil Red O staining of NAFLD
  patients. The percentage of lipid area in liver sections was detected by Oil red
  O staining. F. HE staining of mice liver tissues. G-I. The levels of ALT, AST and
  TG in serum. M. Oil Red O staining of mice tissues. The percentage of lipid area
  in liver sections was detected by Oil red O staining. J-L. Levels of serum IL-1β,
  IL-6 and TNF-α. N. Immunohistochemical analysis of NUP85 in MCS group and MCD group.
  O-P. The expression level of NUP85 was detected by RT-qPCR and Western blotting.
  Measurement metrics are shown in the figure. All experimental results of this study
  were replicated at least three times. **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 compared with the pair
  group.
