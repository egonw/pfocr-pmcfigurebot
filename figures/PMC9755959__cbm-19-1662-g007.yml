caption: MiR-378a-3p inhibits tumorigenesis in vivo. (A) Image of nude mice with xenotransplantation
  after 3 weeks. (B) Images of tumors 3 weeks later. (C) Tumor volume, calculated
  and statistically analyzed over 3 weeks. (D) The mice were sacrificed for tumor
  weight measurement, and statistical analysis was performed after 3 weeks (*P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01).
article_title: MiR-378a-3p acts as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer via directly
  targeting RAB31 and inhibiting the Hedgehog pathway proteins GLI1/2.
