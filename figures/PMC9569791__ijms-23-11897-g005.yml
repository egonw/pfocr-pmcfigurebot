caption: The implication of the Hippo pathway in Vibro infection. The survival rates
  of V. parahaemolyticus-infected shrimp after silencing Hippo (A), Wts (B), and Yki
  (C) were statistically analyzed. (D) The V. parahaemolyticus bacterial load in gills
  was detected by qPCR. ** p < 0.01 by two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test.
