caption: 'Expressions of ER stress-related proteins in kidneys of the IL-10−/− and
  control wild mice 7 days after UUO. ERS signalling pathway protein levels (IRE1,
  PERK, eIF2α, BiP, CHOP, and DR5) were determined with Western blotting (A). β-actin
  was used as a loading control. Densities of bands were quantified using ImageJ software
  (n = 3 to 4) and bars indicate means ± SEMs (B). * p < 0.05 vs. IL-10+/+-sham mice,
  # p < 0.05 vs. UUO induced IL-10+/+.'
