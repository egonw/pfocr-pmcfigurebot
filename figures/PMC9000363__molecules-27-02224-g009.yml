caption: Pathway enrichment. Summary of pathway analysis of significantly reversed
  metabolites between rats in MG and SBS-treated rats. Rich factor and KEGG pathway
  were plotted on the x- and y-axis, respectively. The larger the dot, the greater
  the number of metabolites that were enriched in the pathway. The darker the dot
  color, the more significant the enrichment. (a) Nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism.
  (b) Alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism. (c) Citrate cycle (TCA cycle).
  (d) Arginine-proline metabolism. (e) Glycerophospholipid metabolism. (f) Glycerolipid
  metabolism.
