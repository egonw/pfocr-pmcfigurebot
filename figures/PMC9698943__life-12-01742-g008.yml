caption: 'Downstream mechanisms of ATAD1 involved in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and
  lipid metabolic process: (A) dot plots showing the cross-association screening between
  shATAD1 efficacy and altered mRNA levels. X-score represents log(fold-change) of
  shATAD1 efficacy between samples of high and low expression of target mRNA. Y-score
  represents log(fold-change) of target mRNA levels between samples of high and low
  shATAD1 efficacy. Red and blue dots denote significantly upregulated and downregulated
  mRNAs by shATAD1, respectively. Then the 190 altered mRNAs are subjected to functional
  enrichment analysis using Metascape portal; (B) bar chart of enriched terms across
  input mRNAs, colored by p-values. Top two enriched terms (p < 10âˆ’4) are highlighted;
  (C) Network of enriched terms colored by cluster ID, where nodes that share the
  same cluster ID are typically close to each other; (D,E), dot plot showing the Pearson
  correlation coefficient of ATAD1 with WNT1 (D) and DGAT1 (E) by retrieving TCGA-PRAD
  datasets; and (F) a schematic illustrates that oncogenic ERG acts as a transcriptional
  repressor to reduce ATAD1 expression, which could lead to 190 altered mRNAs and
  perturbation of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway and lipid metabolic process.'
