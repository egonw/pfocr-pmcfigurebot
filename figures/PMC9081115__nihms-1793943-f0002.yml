figure_title: Live MKP103 induces a host metabolic response distinct from that stimulated
  by PAMPs or KPPR1
caption: '(A) Schematic diagram showing the metabolic activities that fuel pro- and
  anti-inflammatory effector functions in immune cells.(B) Principal component analysis
  (PCA) score plot showing principal component 1 (PC1) versus PC2 of the metabolites
  extracted from the BALF of uninfected mice (PBS, n = 4 mice/biological replicates)
  and mice treated intranasally 48 h earlier with live MKP103 (n = 5 mice) or KPPR1
  (n = 5 mice) or with purified LPS from each Kp strain and E. coli (n = 4, 4 and
  6 mice respectively). The above-mentioned biological replicates were from 2 independent
  experiments and the data represent the median with 95% confidence interval.(C) Heatmap
  showing specific BALF metabolites from (B). The level of each metabolite in response
  to the different stimuli is compared by fold increase over the uninfected control
  (PBS). Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA for each metabolite;
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.(D) Pathway enrichment analysis of BALF metabolites
  depicting significantly upregulated pathways in MKP103-infected versus uninfected
  mice.(E) DESI-MS spectral images of glutamate, α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), oxidized
  octadecenoate (FA derivative), glutathione (GSH) and itaconate in 10 μm representative
  lung sections from uninfected (n = 2 mice, i.e., 1 spectral image/technical replicate
  of 2 biological samples from 2 experiments) and MKP103 (n = 2 mice, i.e., 1 technical
  replicate of 2 biological samples from 2 experiments) or KPPR1 (n = 1 mouse, i.e.,
  1 technical replicate of 1 biological sample)-infected mice. Scale bar (E): 1cm.(F)
  Carbon source assimilation of KPPR1 relative to MKP103 (PM1 Biolog, n = 3 biological
  replicates from 3 independent experiments). The color intensity in the heatmap corresponds
  to the absorbance of KPPR1 (OD590nm) as a readout of bacterial respiration in the
  presence of the indicated carbon source, normalized to the absorbance (OD590nm)
  of MKP103 in the same carbon source. Asterisks denote statistically significant
  differences as determined by multiple t-test (two-stage step-up method of Benjamini,
  Krieger and Yekutieli, one unpaired t-test per carbon source) with a false discovery
  rate (FDR) of 1%.'
