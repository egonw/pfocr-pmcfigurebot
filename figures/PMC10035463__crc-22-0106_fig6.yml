caption: Loss of Notch4 resulted in the downregulation of Pcsk5 expression in pancreatic
  cancer. A, Statistically significantly differentially expressed genes of RNA-seq
  analyses between PKC versus N4−/−PKC pancreatic tumor cell lines (FDR < 0.05) were
  compared with the Reactome Pathway database. NGF processing was the top signaling
  pathway associated with Notch4 loss, thus NGF and Pcsk5 in the pathway were implicated
  to be downstream mediators of Notch4. B, Volcanoplot depicting the differentially
  expressed RNAs between PKC versus N4−/−PKC pancreatic tumor cell lines (FDR < 0.05).
  RNAs were organized by log2 fold change (x-axis) and P value (y-axis). The Pcsk5
  gene was one of the top ranked genes differentially expressed, with its expression
  decreased by 8.36-folds, with P = 2.66E-07 and FDR = 5.82E-05 associated with Notch4
  loss. C, qRT-PCR analysis confirmed the expression levels of Pcsk5 were downregulated
  in the N4−/−PKC pancreatic tumor cell lines (n = 4) compared with those of the PKC
  pancreatic tumor cell lines (n = 4). ***, P < 0.001 by t test. D, Representative
  images of Pcsk5 immunolabeling of PanIN (ⅰ, ⅱ) and PDAC (ⅲ, ⅳ) in the PKC and the
  N4−/−PKC mice. Lower expression of Pcsk5 was detected in the PanIN and PDAC of the
  N4−/−PKC mice compared with the PKC mice. Arrowheads point to ADM structures while
  arrow point to PanIN structures (D ⅰ–ⅳ; folds of magnification are 100× in the panel
  and 400× in the window, respectively). E, Kaplan–Meier survival analysis of patients
  with PDAC showed that patients with low (n = 115) PCSK5 expression had better overall
  survival than those with high (n = 61) PCSK5 expression (Human Protein Atlas). *,
  P < 0.05 by log-rank test.
