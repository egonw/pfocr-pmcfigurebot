caption: 'Effect of 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid on cell viability of GES-1, AGS and HGC-27
  cells were detected by CCK-8 assay. A: Effect of 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid (18β-GRA)
  on cell viability of AGS cells; B: Effect of 18β-GRA on cell viability of HGC-27
  cells; C: IC50 value of AGS and HGC-27 cells were treated with 18β-GRA for 24, 48
  and 72 h; D: Effect of low, medium and high doses of 18β-GRA on cell viability of
  AGS cells; E: Effect of low, medium and high doses of 18β-GRA on cell viability
  of HGC-27 cells; F: Effect of 18β-GRA on cell viability of GES-1 cells. All data
  are from three independent samples. The data is represented as the mean ± SD. aP
  < 0.05, bP < 0.01, cP < 0.001. 18β-GRA: 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid.'
