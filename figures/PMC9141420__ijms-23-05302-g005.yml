caption: Effect of Bmal1 removal on the transcription of daily biological pathways.
  Isolated RPE samples were collected at different time points (ZT1, ZT7, ZT13, ZT19;
  ZT0 = light onset at 7AM) were subjected to high throughput RNA-sequencing analysis
  and a rhythmic analysis performed within each genotype. Taking the rhythmic (r)
  and non-rhythmic genes (nr) datasets, a Venn diagram analysis was carried out (A).
  This comparison analysis revealed that 830 protein coding transcripts remained rhythmic
  despite the loss of Bmal1 in the RPE (A[1]). Additionally, 3936 protein coding transcripts
  that were rhythmic in RPE Bmal1 WT samples loss rhythmicity in RPE Bmal1 KO samples
  (A[2]). Interestingly, 2696 protein coding transcripts that were not rhythmic in
  RPE Bmal1 WT samples were now rhythmic in RPE Bmal1 KO samples (A[3]). A total of
  13,350 protein coding transcripts were identified to be non-rhythmic in both genotypes
  (A). KEGG pathway analysis indicated that the 830 protein coding transcripts are
  involved in RPE cell maintenance such as cell morphology, transepithelial transportation,
  metabolic processes, and background phagocytic processes (B); 3936 protein coding
  transcripts that lost rhythmicity in RPE Bmal1 KO are possibly involved in mediating
  the peak in phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments and turnover of engulfed
  outer segments (C); 2696 protein coding transcripts that gained rhythmicity in the
  absence of Bmal1 did not indicate any particular pattern of activated pathways with
  only 2 KEGG pathways being statistically significant (D).
