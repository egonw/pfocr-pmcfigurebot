caption: Pathways of P. kudriavzevii C-16 response to lactic acid stress. Red letters
  mean upregulated genes. Transcripts of P. kudriavzevii C-16 are shown near the pathway
  as a heat map, based on fold-changes in transcript levels relative to the type strain
  ATCC 24210. Colour legend is shown at the top right of the map.
