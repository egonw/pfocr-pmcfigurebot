figure_title: HM13 regulates the biological functions in breast cancer through autophagy
caption: A In SUM1315 and ZR-75-1 cell lines transfected with negative control (si-NC),
  siRNA (si-HM13), siRNA and DMSO (si+DMSO), siRNA and CQ (si+CQ), the protein levels
  of LC3B-II/I and p62 were analyzed by western blot, respectively. B, C Cell proliferation
  abilities were determined by CCK8 (B) and colony formation assays (C). D Representative
  images of the transwell assays using SUM1315 an ZR-75-1 cell lines transfected with
  negative control (si-NC), siRNA (si-HM13), siRNA and DMSO (si + DMSO), siRNA and
  CQ (si + CQ). Scale bars, 50 µm. Data were shown as mean ± SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.
article_title: Histocompatibility Minor 13 (HM13), targeted by miR-760, exerts oncogenic
  role in breast cancer by suppressing autophagy and activating PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway.
