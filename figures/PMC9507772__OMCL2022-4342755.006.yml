caption: Comprehensive bioinformatics analysis in DCM. (a) Identification of mRNAs
  that hypothetically regulated miR-372-3p based on miRDB and TargetScan databases.
  (b) Target sequences of miR-372-3p in the 3′-UTR of PIK3CA. (c and d) Heatmaps were
  sketched to illustrate the DEGs in DCM using microarray GSE26887 and GSE112556 datasets.
  (e) A volcano plot was sketched to illustrate the DEGs in DCM using microarray GSE146621
  dataset. (f and g) GO enrichment analysis for biological processes of DEGs using
  microarray GSE26887 and GSE112556 datasets. P < 0.05 denotes significant enrichment.
  (h) Scatter plot of KEGG enrichment analysis of DEGs using microarray GSE26887 dataset.
  P < 0.05 denotes significant enrichment. (i) The PPI network of DEGs was constructed
  according to the data from GSE26887. (j) PIK3CA was identified as a hub gene.
