caption: 'A RT-qPCR measurement of Col4α1 expression in HK-2 cells after treatment
  with TGFβ-1 and BMSC-EVs. B RT-qPCR measurement of α-SMA expression in HK-2 cells
  after treatment with TGFβ-1 and BMSC-EVs. C RT-qPCR measurement of TGF-βR1 expression
  in HK-2 cells after treatment with TGFβ-1 and BMSC-EVs. In the panels of (A, B,
  C) *p < 0.05 vs. control. #p < 0.05 vs. TGFβ-1. D Masson’s trichrome staining for
  the deposition of collagen in the renal tissues from UUO rats treated with BMSC-EVs
  (n = 8). E Immunohistochemistry assay of Col4α1, α-SMA, TGF-βR1 and collagen I in
  renal tissues from UUO rats treated with BMSC-EVs (n = 8). F Western blot analysis
  of Col4α1, α-SMA, TGF-βR1, and collagen I in renal tissues from UUO rats treated
  with BMSC-EVs. In the panels of (E, F) *p < 0.05 vs. rats receiving sham operation
  and injected with PBS. #p < 0.05 vs. rats undergoing UUO surgery and injected with
  PBS. The cell experiment was repeated three independent times.'
