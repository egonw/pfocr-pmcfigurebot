caption: 'Neu5Ac induces HUVECs injury by promoting ferroptosis pathway. HUVECs were
  treated with Neu5Ac (20 mM) for 24 h. (A) The hierarchically clustered heatmap showed
  the differentially expressed genes in HUVECs (n = 3 per group). (B) The hierarchically
  clustered heatmap showed the ferroptosis-related genes in HUVECs (n = 3 per group).
  (C) Bubbled blot showed the most significantly altered KEGG pathways in HUVECs,
  and ferroptosis pathway was enriched mostly (n = 3 per group). (D) GSEA analyzed
  the enrichment plot of the ferroptosis pathway in HUVECs (n = 3 per group). (E)
  Construction of protein-protein interaction regulatory network based on differentially
  expressed genes (n = 3 per group). (F) Immunofluorescence staining of GPX4 and TFRC
  in HUVECs treated with Neu5Ac (20 mM) for 24 h, showing decrease GPX4 level and
  increase TFRC level in HUVECs exposed Neu5Ac compared with control. Scale bar =
  25 Î¼m. The quantification data were shown below (n > 3 per group). (G) HUVECs were
  treated with Neu5Ac (0, 5, 10, 20 mM) for 24h, and increased TFRC expression, but
  lows GPX4 expression, and the quantification of these proteins'' expression was
  shown in the right panel (n = 4 per group). Statistical analysis was performed by
  Student t test for F and one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey test for G. KEGG: Kyoto
