figure_title: Multi‐layer effects of the hotspot around GPA1 and STE20 on chromosome
  8
caption: Gpa1 and Ste20 play key roles in the mating response pathway (left, through
  transcription factor complex Ste12/Ste12) and filamentous growth regulation pathway
  (middle, through transcription factor complex Tec1/Ste12). Ste20 additionally regulates
  the osmotic stress response pathway (right, through transcription factors Msn2/Msn4).
  Depicted are genes that are known to have a direct or indirect connection with GPA1
  and/or STE20. Genes that we found to be affected by the GPA1/STE20 hotspot on any
  molecular layer are indicated with arrows in the respective color of each layer.
  The arrow orientation indicates the fold change direction. References for each known
  connection are given in Dataset , .Replacement of the reference alleles of STE20
  and GPA1 causes changes in the transcriptome of the BY strain similar to those observed
  in the QTL cross. Each transcript that was targeted by a QTL at the GPA1/STE20 locus
  is represented as a blue dot. A linear fit of the effects of the double replacement
  and the effects of the hotspot is shown as a solid line. The slope (m) is indicated
  in the figure title.Effects of the allele replacements on the phosphoproteome are
  shown, with each affected phosphopeptide affected by a QTL at this locus being represented
  as a red dot. A linear fit of the effects of the double replacement and the effects
  of the hotspot is shown as a solid line. The slope (m) is indicated in the figure
  title.Pearson’s r and the slope of a linear model (m, as depicted in B and C) are
  shown for each replacement strain for the phosphoproteome and transcriptome, respectively.
  The standard error of each slope is shown as bars. Each dot shows the comparison
  of two genotypes based on three biological replicates per genotype.
