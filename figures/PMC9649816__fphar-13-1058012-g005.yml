caption: RNA-seq analysis revealed genes that response to ICE treatment in LPS-stimulated
  RAW 264.7 cells. DEGs between LPS-vs-ICE groups were selected and statistics analysed
  (A) and displayed in a volcano plot (B); Cluster analysis of DEGs were showed in
  a heat map (C). Red colour in the charts indicates the genes were upregulated and
  blue colour indicates the genes were downregulated.
