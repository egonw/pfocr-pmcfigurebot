caption: Tau-afforded protection against microbial sepsis depends on an intact autophagy
  pathway. WT and LC3b−/− mice were subjected to CLP-induced midgrade polymicrobial
  sepsis and treated with Tau at 6 h before CLP. Mice subjected to sham-CLP were used
  as the Con. (A and B) The Kaplan–Meier survival curves show that administration
  of Tau confers a 100% protection in WT mice (P = 0.0042) but fails to protect LC3b−/−
  mice from sepsis-associated lethality (P = 0.5921) (n = 21 per group). (C and D)
  Bacterial counts in the blood, liver, spleen, and lungs were assessed at 12 h post-CLP
  and expressed as log CFU/mL. (E and F) Serum LDH, CK, ALT, and urea levels were
  assessed at 18 h post-CLP to reflect sepsis-induced tissue and organ injury. (G
  and H) Blood vascular permeability in the lungs, liver, and kidneys was assessed
  at 12 h post-CLP and expressed as nanograms of dye/milligram of tissue. (I and J)
  Gut permeability was assessed at 12 h post-CLP and expressed as the fold change.
  Data in C–J are mean ± SD (n = 4 to 6 mice per group). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 versus
  PBS-treated WT or LC3b−/− mice.
