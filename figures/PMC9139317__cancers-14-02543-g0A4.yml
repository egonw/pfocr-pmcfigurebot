caption: Association between KYNU mRNA expression and gene-based signatures of immune
  infiltrates and immune checkpoint blockade related genes. Box and whisker plots
  illustrating the distribution of gene-based signatures reflective of cytotoxic T-cells,
  regulatory T cells, as well as immune checkpoint blockade-related genes CD274 (PDL-L1),
  PDCD1 (PD1), and CTLA4 in the Okayama Lung Cancer [] gene expression dataset for
  LUAD tumors stratified by KYNU mRNA expression into the bottom and top 25th percentiles.
  The center line and bottom/upper bounds indicate median and 1st/3rd quartiles, respectively.
  Whiskers represent the 5th and 95th percentile of values. Statistical significance
  was determined by two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test. Gene based signatures of immune
  infiltrates are based on Bindea et al. [].
