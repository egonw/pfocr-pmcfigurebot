figure_title: Cluster-specific changes of cellular phenotypes after CFC and Tlr9 KO
caption: a CFC induced decrease of GAP43 from excitatory clusters 11 and 24, but the
  most dramatic effect was the disappearance of Dcx from most excitatory clusters
  (7, 11, 20, 24, 29) and inhibitory cluster 19 (gray stars). This CFC effect was
  prevented by Tlr9 KO (black stars), enabling these clusters to retain Dcx while
  losing Slc17a6. In response to CFC, the most interesting change was in cluster 28,
  which shifted from an undifferentiated to a mature DGGC phenotype (Prox1+ Calb1+
  Dcx−), an effect prevented by Tlr9 KO. In response to Tlr9KO, significant phenotype
  changes were noted in immature DGGC (cluster 25), which lost their excitatory and
  acquired an inhibitory phenotype, and in excitatory cluster 26, which switched from
  an undifferentiated vGlut2+ Calb1+ GAP43− NeuroD6− phenotype to a vGlut1+ Satb2+
  GAP43+ NeuroD6+ phenotype typical of CA neurons.
