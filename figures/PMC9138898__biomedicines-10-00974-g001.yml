caption: 'Apoptosis signaling. Intrinsic pathway (blue shading): DNA damage is sensed
  by tumor suppressor p53. P53 controls the Bcl-2 protein family, which includes pro-apoptotic
  (e.g., Bid and Bax) and pro-survival (e.g., Bcl-2) factors that tightly regulate
  mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Activated Bax and Bak form
  pores in the outer mitochondrial membranes, which allow Smac/Diablo and cytochrome
  c to translocate from the intermembrane space into the cytosol. Cytochrome c binds
  Apaf-1 and caspase 9, which form the so-called “apoptosome” to activate effector
  caspases 3, 6, and 7. Smac/Diablo inhibits XIAP, which releases the block on the
  proteolytic activity of effector caspases. Extrinsic pathway (gray shading): Pro-apoptotic
  ligands such as TNF, FasL, or TRAIL engage death receptors on tumor cells, leading
  to the formation of death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) by recruiting FADD and
  the pro-forms of initiator caspases 8 and 10. Active initiator caspases may then
  activate effector caspases 3, 6, and 7, but this is limited in most cancer cells
  because of inhibitory factors such as cIAP, cFLIP, and XIAP. Caspase 8 may engage
  the intrinsic pathway via Bid truncation and MOMP. Released effector caspases may
  create a positive feedback and activate more caspase 8 in some cells. NFκB-responsive
  regulators (yellow boxes): The molecular network of apoptosis regulation includes
  NFκB target genes on several levels. Changes in NFκB activities therefore determine
  the abundances of pro-survival and pro-apoptosis regulators, and affect tumor cell
  fate decisions in response to death-ligands, chemotherapy, and radiation.'
