caption: 'Gliosis in the retina of pre-symptomatic APP/PS1 mice. (A) Representative
  images of Iba1 and GFAP immunolabelling in the retina of TG APP/PS1 and WT mice
  aged 3 (upper panels) and 12 (lower panels) months. Scale bar = 50 μm. (B) qPCR
  analysis of mRNA expression of iba1 and gfap in the retina of TG APP/PS1 and WT
  mice at 3 months. Results expressed as mean +/− SEM. ** p < 0.01. qPCR quantification
  of both GFAP and Iba1: n = 6:3M + 3F for WT mice and n = 4:2M + 2F for TG mice at
  3 months.'
