caption: A schematic representation of Toll signaling system in D. citri. The model
  highlights the Toll signaling pathway as it functions during the immune response.
  The pattern recognition receptors recognize pathogens and activate a serin protease
  cascade and cause a binding of Speatzle to Toll. Toll binds to Myd88 through TIR
  domains and induces Myd88 to bind to Tube and Pelle through their death domains
  and make a triangle. The bindings lead to the recruitment of two proteins, the adaptor
  Tube and kinases Pelle. This results in the proteolytic degradation of the inhibitor
  kB (IkB) protein Cactus and activation of the NF-kB proteins Dif and Dorsal (same
  protein in D. citri). The activated Dorsal/Dif is translocated to the nucleus and
  induces the transcription and production of antimicrobial peptides (AMP).
