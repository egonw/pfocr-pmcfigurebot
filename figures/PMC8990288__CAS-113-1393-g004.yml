caption: Effect of TRAF6 expression on NF‐κB, pNF‐κB, and VEGF‐C expression in SW480
  and HCT116 cells. (A, B) Western blotting analysis of NF‐κB, pNF‐κB, and VEGF‐C
  expression in SW480 and HCT116 cells transfected with pCDH and pCDH‐TRAF6, respectively.
  GAPDH served as a loading control. (C, D) The relative protein expression levels
  of NF‐κB, pNF‐κB, and VEGF‐C in SW480 and HCT116 cells were quantified. Data are
  shown as mean ±SD. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001
