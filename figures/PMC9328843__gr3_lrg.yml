caption: Disease-gene interactions. (A) Venn diagram for identifying the RBPs commonly
  shared in COVID-19, brain-related disorders, and cancers. The list of 91 RBPs interacting
  with SARS-CoV-2 proteins was retrieved from Schmidt et al. . Out of 91 RBPs, 56
  RBPs showed interaction with 278 different brain-related disorders using several
  disease-gene interaction databases. The list of 607 RBPs showing dysregulated in
  15 different types of cancers was retrieved from Wang et al. . (B) PPI network of
  commonly shared nine RBPs (yellow) in COVID-19 (green), cancer (red), and neurological
  disorders (blue). (C) Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis of nine shared
  RBPs.
