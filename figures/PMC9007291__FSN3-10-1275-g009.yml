caption: 'Effects of fermented Dendrobium officinale polysaccharides (FDOP) on the
  Nf‐E2‐related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway. Effects of FDOP on Nrf2 content
  (a), transcription expression (d), Kelch‐like ECH‐associated protein 1 (Keap1) content
  (b), and transcription expression (e). Effects of FDOP on the activities of NAD(P)H:quinone
  oxidoreductase 1 (NQO‐1) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO‐1) (c) and transcription expression
  (f). Each value is expressed as mean ±standard deviation. Three parallel experiments
  were performed in each group. The difference analysis between other experimental
  groups and the ultraviolet radiation (UVA) model group is indicated by "*" (*: p < .05,
  **: p < .01, ***: p < .001)'
