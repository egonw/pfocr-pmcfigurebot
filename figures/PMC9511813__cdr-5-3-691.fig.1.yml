caption: 'SIAH is the most conserved downstream signaling gatekeeper in the EGFR/K-RAS/SIAH
  pathway, whose persistent activation is driving TNBC malignancy, tumor relapse,
  and metastasis. (A) SIAH is the most evolutionarily conserved and the most downstream
  signaling module identified in the EGFR/K-RAS signaling pathway thus far. (B) Loss
  of SIAH expression (SIAHLow/OFF) after effective NACT is correlated with EGFR/K-RAS
  pathway inactivation and tumor regression/remission, whereas persistent SIAH expression
  (SIAHHigh/ON) after ineffective NACT is correlated with EGFR/K-RAS pathway activation
  and tumor progression/early relapse. Persistent high SIAH expression (SIAHHigh/ON)
  in high-risk residual tumors post NACT is correlated with EGFR/K-RAS pathway activation,
  chemo-resistance, and early tumor relapse. (C-D) TNBC tumors were stained with H&E,
  SIAH, Ki67, phospho-ERK, and EGFR. SIAH outperforms Ki67. SIAH is prognostic and
  Ki67 is not prognostic in NACT-treated high-risk and locally advanced breast cancer.
  We found that SIAHLow/OFF post-NACT correlates with tumor remission and prolonged
  survival (Alive at 5 years) (C). We found that persistent SIAHHigh/ON expression
  in residual tumors post-NACT is associated with tumor relapse and poor survival
  (Dead before3-5 years) (D). (E) SIAH1 and (F) SIAH2 are extraordinarily conserved
  across metazoan species. Conclusion: We found that SIAHON/OFF expression is a binary
  code that reflects tumor-driving EGFR/K-RAS/SIAH pathway activationON/inactivationOFF
  in TNBC primary and residual tumors As such, SIAH is strategically well positioned
  to become a new TNBC target, and a new tumor-specific, therapy-responsive, and prognostic
  biomarker to risk-stratify pIR patients, detect the emergence of treatment-refractory
  tumors, quantify NACT/NST efficacy, augment RCB classifications, forecast early
  relapse, and predict patient survival in real time in the clinic. SIAH: Human homologs
  of Drosophila Seven In Absentia (SINA); NACT: neoadjuvant chemotherapy; RCB: residual
  cancer burden; TNBC: triple-negative breast cancer.'
