figure_title: Didymin protects cell injury against OGD/R-induced neuronal injury.
  (A) MTT assay was performed to detect the cell viability of PC12 cells. (B) MTT
  assay was performed to detect the cell viability of OGD/R treated PC12 cells. (C
  and D) Flow cytometry was performed to detect the apoptosis of OGD/R treated PC12
  cells. (E) Western blot was performed to detect the protein expression of Bax, c-caspase-3,
  and Bcl-2 in OGD/R treated PC12 cells. *p<0.05 vs. control group; †p<0.05 vs. OGD/R
