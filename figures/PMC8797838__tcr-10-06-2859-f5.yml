caption: The Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), tumor mutation burden, and clinic-pathological
  relevance analysis of ITGAL and KLRB1 genes. (A) ITGAL- and KLRB1-correlated GSEA
  pathways. (B) Running enrichment genes of the ITGAL- and KLRB1-correlated T-cell
  receptor signaling pathway. (C) Tumor mutation burden analysis for ITGAL and KLRB1
  gene expression levels. (D) Hub genes expression difference analysis in response
  to the level of stromal, immune, and ESTIMATE infiltration. (E) Hub genes expression
  difference analysis in response to LUAD clinical stage. (F) Hub genes expression
  difference analysis among cancer and para-cancer tissue. (G,H) Hub genes expression
  difference analysis based on KRAS/EGFR mutation and ALK fusion mutation status.
