caption: This figure uses the drug discovery and development pathway (part 1) to illustrate
  that while there may be numerous candidates identified at the early stages of research,
  very few of these will successfully traverse the translational process. In part
  2 of the figure there are scientific and operational bottlenecks that slow the process
  and may eliminate some viable candidates. The bottlenecks shown here are meant only
  to be illustrative of the variety of challenges encountered and are not shown in
  any particular order. Further, this linear pathway simplifies a very complex process
  that is more accurately represented in the NCATS Drug Discovery, Development, and
  Deployment Maps (4DM). Part 3 of this figure provides specific examples of translational
  science challenges across a variety of research areas, how translational science
  principles have been applied to address these challenges, and the solutions that
  overcame these challenges. The goal is that by utilizing translational science principles
  and approaches, all research can be made more effective and efficient as depicted
  in part 4 of the figure.
