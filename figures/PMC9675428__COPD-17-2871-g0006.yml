caption: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotation. KEGG pathway
  annotation for the upregulated and downregulated proteins and the associated number
  of protein between the group with acute exacerbation of COPD and the healthy control
  group (A), and between the group with stable COPD and the healthy control group
  (B). The circle size represents the number of differentially expressed proteins
  in the GO term. The circle color indicates the âˆ’log10P value representing the significant
  degree of enrichment.
