caption: The expression of FAP is shown to be significantly increased in ccRCC, and
  its high expression predicts a poor prognosis. A FAP expression in multiple cancers
  based on the TIMER database. B In the TCGA-KIRC dataset, FAP expression was shown
  to be significantly higher in ccRCC tumor tissues than in normal tissues. C It has
  been shown that FAP expression is elevated in cancerous tissue relative to surrounding
  healthy tissues. D ROC analysis illustrated that AUC of 0.780 (95% confidence interval = 0.714–0.846)
  from the TCGA-KIRC dataset for FAP expression, which precisely distinguishes ccRCC
  cancer tissues from normal tissues. E–G To ensure that the results from the TCGA-KIRC
  dataset were statistically significant, OS, DSS, as well as PFI survival curves
  for ccRCC patients with high (red) and low (blue) FAP expression were all plotted.
