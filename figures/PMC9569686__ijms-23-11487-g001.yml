caption: 'The expression analysis of the mRNA of fibrotic marker genes in the heart
  tissues of control and GW788388 drug-treated male Npr1 gene-disrupted mice: The
  expression levels of mRNA of Col-1-α, Col-3, α-SMA, MCP-1, CTGF, PAI-1, TGF-β1RI,
  and TGF-β1RII in the heart tissues of control and drug-treated mice are shown in
  panels (A–H). The expression of mRNA was normalized to GAPDH expression. Values
  are expressed as means ± S.E. (n = 6 animals in each group). Statistical significance
  is expressed as ### p < 0.001, vehicle-treated 0-copy and 1-copy vs. 2-copy; * p
  < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, vehicle-treated 0-copy, 1-copy and 2 copy vs.
  drug-treated same gene copy number. NS: not significant.'
