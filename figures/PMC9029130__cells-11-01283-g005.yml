caption: NAD+ exposure alters the transcriptome of aNSPCs under proliferating and
  differentiation conditions. (A,B) Heatmap showing the differentially expressed genes
  (DEGs) in Ctrl and NAD+ exposure groups under proliferating (A) and differentiation
  (B) conditions. Three biological repeating samples of Ctrl and NAD+ exposure (1
  mM) were adopted for RNA sequencing. The significance of expression was determined
  by the |FC| > 2 and p-value < 0.05. (C) GO enrichment analysis of the up-regulated
  and down-regulated genes induced by NAD+ exposure (proliferating condition). The
  significance of expression was determined by |FC| > 2 and p-value < 0.05. (D) GO
  enrichment analysis of the up-regulated and down-regulated genes induced by NAD+
  exposure (differentiation condition). The significance of expression was determined
  by |FC| > 2 and p-value < 0.05. (E) FPKM values of several genes related to ATP
  metabolic process and response to glucose.
