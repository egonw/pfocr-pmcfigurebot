caption: Imaging glucose metabolism with HP 13C-MRI. (A) An increased expression of
  glucose transporters, for example, GLUT1 and elevated glycolysis is seen in cells
  with higher energy demand, for example, cancer cells and activated T cells. (B)
  Several 13C-labeled imaging probes have been developed for evaluating different
  downstream processes of the glucose metabolism pathway. These include [1-13C]pyruvate
  for imaging the kinetics of pyruvate-to-lactate conversion, 13C-labeled bicarbonate
  (H13CO3âˆ’) for detecting tumor pH in vivo, and increased production of [1,4-13C2]malate
  from the administered [1,4-13C2]fumarate as a surrogate biomarker of cell necrosis
  or tumor cell death in response to treatment. (C) HP 13C-MRI of a patient with prostate
  cancer showed a marked decrease in [1-13C]pyruvate to [1-13C]lactate conversion,
  with a corresponding reduction in tumor size, in the three bone metastases (left
  acetabular, left and right iliac lesions) between week 8 and 19 following pembrolizumab
  treatment. Images adapted and reproduced with permission from de Kouchkovsky et
  al. (A) and (B) are graphics created by the author (DL). ATP, adenosine triphosphate;
  NADH, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; FADH, reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide;
  TCA, tricarboxylic acid; PC, pyruvate carboxylase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase.
