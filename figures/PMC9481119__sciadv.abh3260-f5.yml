figure_title: Combining exercise with administration of a TrkB agonist provides no
  further rescue of ataxia in SCA684Q/84Q mice
caption: (A) Schematic of exercise and 7,8-DHF combination therapy on SCA684Q/84Q
  mice (SCA6). (B) Schematics of possible outcomes if exercise and 7,8-DHF are additive,
  suggesting that they act via distinct pathways (left), or if no further improvement
  is observed in motor coordination when exercise and 7,8-DHF are co-administered,
  suggesting that they act on the same signaling pathway (right). (C) No additional
  improvement is observed when exercise and 7,8-DHF administration are combined, and
  exercise and 7,8-DHF improve motor coordination, similarly suggesting that they
  act on the same pathway. All statistical tests and P values are reported in table
  S2. *P < 0.05; n.s., P > 0.05.
