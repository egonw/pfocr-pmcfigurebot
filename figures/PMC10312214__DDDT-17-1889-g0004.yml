caption: 'BER induce cytotoxicity via the PI3K/AKT/ mTOR signaling pathway. (A) The
  phosphorylation levels of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR in ATC cells treated with or without
  BER for 72 h were detected by Western blot analysis. Quantification of the relative
  gray value of bands compared to GAPDH. (B) Effects of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
  pathways on BER-induced inhibition of ATC cell viability. CAL-62 and BHT-101 cells
  were pretreated with 1 μMWOR (a PI3K inhibitor), 0.5 μMMK2206 (an AKT inhibitor),
  or 0.2 µMRA (an mTOR inhibitor) for 2h prior to 80 or 40 μM BBR treatment for 72
  h, and cell viability was detected using CCK-8 assays. Data are expressed as the
  mean ± SD from three independent experiments. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, and ***P<0.001
  vs. the control group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, and ###P < 0.001 vs the BER group.'
