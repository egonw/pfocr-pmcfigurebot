caption: GGCT regulates the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway by interacting with MRPL9.
  (A). The protein expression levels of P38, p-P38, ERK and p-ERK in the shGGCT/shMRPL9/sh-GGCT
  + shMRPL9 group were detected by Western blot in K1/BCPAP cells. (B) The expression
  levels of P38, p-P38, ERK and p-ERK in the shGGCT/shMRPL9/sh-GGCT + shMRPL9 group
  in K1 cell line were analyzed by J image, normalized to Actin (n = 3). (C) The expression
  levels of P38, p-P38, ERK and p-ERK in the shGGCT/shMRPL9/sh-GGCT + shMRPL9 group
  in BCPAP cell line were analyzed by J image, normalized to Actin (n = 3) Measurement
  data (mean ± standard deviation) between two groups were compared by paired t test.
  “**” represents p ≤ 0.01.
