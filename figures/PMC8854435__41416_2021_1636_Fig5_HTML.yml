figure_title: V9302 induces synergistic killing and ferroptosis and inhibits the mTOR
  pathway in TNBC cells
caption: 'a–d For synergy analysis, SUM159 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with
  paclitaxel (0, 0.625, 1.25, 5 and 10 nM) and V9302 (0, 2.5, 5 and 10 µM) individually
  or in combination at different concentrations for 72 h. The combination index (CI)
  was evaluated by combined dose–response curves fitted to Chou–Talalay lines. CI < 0.7
  indicates weak synergistic interaction, whereas CI < 0.3 and <0.1 indicate moderate
  and strong synergistic interaction, respectively. e, f TNBC cells were treated with
  V9302 at different concentrations with or without ferrostatin-1 for 48 h. T-BHP,
  a ferroptosis inhibitor, was used as a positive control. Cells were stained with
  C11-BODIPY dye and analysed on a flow cytometry using the FL-1 channel. One-way
  ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test was performed for GD2 expression, taking
  untreated cells as the control. ***p = 0.001 and *p = 0.033. g Western blot analysis
  of SUM159 and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with V9302 (0, 5, 10 and 20 µM) for 24 h.
  The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies for p-AKT, p-ERK, p-mTOR and
  p-4E-BP1 at 1:500 dilution and GAPDH at 1:1000. Then, the membranes were incubated
  with respective fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies at 1:3000 and scanned
  using a ChemiDoc Imaging System. The symbols, # and §, indicate Combination Index
  (CI) at different cutoff values (0.7, 0.3 and 0.1).'
