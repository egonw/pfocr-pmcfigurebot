caption: 'Effect of quercetin on the NOD-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) signaling pathway
  in RIMVECs. (a) Effect of quercetin on GSDMD, TLR4, and caspase-1 mRNA expression
  in RIMVECs incubated with LPS+ATP in the presence or absence of quercetin, as measured
  by RT-qPCR (n = 3). Results are expressed as mean ± SEM. ##P < 0.01 versus control
  group, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001 versus LPS+ATP group. (b) Effect of quercetin
  on the expression of NLRP3 and pyroptosis-related proteins: TLR4, NLRP3, pro-caspase-1,
  caspase-1, and GSDMD protein expression (n = 3) in RIMVEC incubated with LPS+ATP
  in the presence or absence of quercetin, as measured by western blot. Results are
  expressed as mean ± SEM. #P < 0.01 versus control group, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  and ***P < 0.001 versus LPS+ATP group. (c) Effect of quercetin on pyroptosis in
  RIMVECs incubated with LPS+ATP in the presence of quercetin measured by flow cytometry
  (n = 3). Results are expressed as mean ± SEM. ##P < 0.01 versus control group, ***P
  < 0.001 versus LPS+ATP group. (d) Effect of quercetin on the pyroptosis-related
  proteins TLR4, caspase-1, and GSDMD in RIMVEC incubated with LPS+ATP in the presence
  or absence of quercetin, as measured by immunofluorescence (n = 3).'
