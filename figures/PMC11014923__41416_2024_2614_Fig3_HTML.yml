figure_title: Capivasertib reverses PI3K/AKT pathway activation and alters cell cycle
  progression in short-term-docetaxel-persister cells
caption: a Schematic of the assay procedure. b Western blot analysis of indicated
  PI3K/AKT pathway markers in lysates from adherent PTEN null and PTEN WT cells pre-treated
  with dose titrations of docetaxel for 24 h followed by wash off and subsequent treatment
  with 750 nM capivasertib for 24 h. Data are representative of two replicate experiments.
article_title: Capivasertib combines with docetaxel to enhance anti-tumour activity
  through inhibition of AKT-mediated survival mechanisms in prostate cancer.
