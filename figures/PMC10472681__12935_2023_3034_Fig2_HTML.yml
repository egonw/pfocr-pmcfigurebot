caption: MALAT1 promotes the proliferation, migration, invasion and anti-apoptosis
  of HCC cells. (a, b) The transfection efficiency of ASO-MALAT1 in Huh7 and Hep3B
  cells was detected by qRT-PCR. (c, d) After silencing MALAT1, cell viability of
  Huh7 and Hep3B cells was detected by CCK-8 assay on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. (e,
  f) Transwell assay was used to detect migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma
  cells after MALAT1 down-regulation. (g) The apoptosis rate of HCC cells after MALAT1
  knockdown was detected by flow cytometry. (h) Western blot analysis was performed
  to detect the expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins in HCC cells after
  MALAT1 knockdown. ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001
article_title: MALAT1/ mir-1-3p mediated BRF2 expression promotes HCC progression
  via inhibiting the LKB1/AMPK signaling pathway.
