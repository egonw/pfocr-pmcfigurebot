figure_title: Hrq1 functions during error-free post-replicative repair
caption: (A) Hrq1 expression increases during S/G2 and then plateaus. Hrq1-9xMYC expressing
  cells were either untreated (asynchronous, AS) or cell cycle arrested in G1 with
  α-factor. The α-factor arrested cells were subsequently released into fresh YPD
  medium (0 min) and grown for 120 min. Protein samples from the indicated time points
  were analyzed by western blot for Hrq1 (anti-MYC), the G2/M cyclin, Clb2, (anti-Clb2),
  or a loading control, Kar2 (anti-Kar2). Quantification from three experiments, the
  mean with SEM is shown (Raw densitometry data in ). The cell cycle stage was analyzed
  FACS. (B) Schematic of post-replicative repair pathways. When the replication fork
  stalls, Pol30 (yellow trimer) is initially monoubiquitylated (Ub, purple circle)
  via Rad6-Rad18 (light and dark blue circles) on lysine 164 (K164). Monoubiquitylation
  of PCNA recruits the error-prone translesion synthesis polymerases, i.e. Rev1 (gray
  circle) to bypass the lesion. Alternatively, PCNA is further poly-ubiquitylated
  by Rad5-Ubc13-Mms2 (light, medium, and dark purple complex). Polyubiquitylation
  of PCNA mediates error-free repair through template switching, which is a homolog
  directed process. A bypass intermediate is shown with the newly synthesized DNA
  in red and the lesion as a yellow star. (C, D) Hrq1 functions in the same pathway
  as Rad6 and Pol30. The indicated yeast strains were five-fold serial diluted onto
  SC medium containing DMSO and/or SC medium containing the indicated amount of cisplatin.
  The plates were photographed after 2 days of incubation at 30°C in the dark. (E)
  Hrq1 functions in the same pathway as Rad5 and Ubc13. Serial dilutions of the indicated
  yeast strains were performed as described in (C). (F) Hrq1 functions in a different
  pathway than Rev1. Serial dilutions of the indicated yeast strains were performed
  as described in (C).

  during DNA intrastrand crosslink repair and is upregulated in breast cancer.
