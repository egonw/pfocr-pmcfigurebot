caption: Rab22a promotes the EMT process of thyroid cancer cells. The western blot
  analysis results revealed the expression of EMT-related proteins induced by Rab22a
  overexpression or knockdown in TPC1 (a) and K1 cells (b). Statistical data were
  the mean ± SD of the three repeated independent trials, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, ∗∗P < 0.01,
  and ∗P < 0.05.
