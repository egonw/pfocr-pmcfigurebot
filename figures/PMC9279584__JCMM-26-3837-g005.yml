caption: Deficient PB1 activates AKT–mTOR pathway in 786‐O and SN12C cells. (A) Analysis
  of TCGA data (Firehose Legacy) showing the key AKT–mTOR signalling players including
  PTEN, PIK3CA, AKT2, TSC1, TSC2, RHEB, MTOR are mutated; red box indicates the mutation
  rate of the gene is greater than 3%. (B) Overlap analysis among PTEN,PIK3CA,AKT2,TSC1,TSC2,RHEB,MTOR
  mutations with 528 RCC samples. (C) Screen shot showing comparisons among PBRM1,
  PTEN, PIK3CA and mTOR. Each horizontal bar represents a sample. Colour bars represent
  samples with genetic alterations and grey bars are samples not altered genetically.
  (D)Western blot analyses of AKT1, mTOR, p‐AKT1 and p‐mTOR in 786‐O and SN12C cells

  signalling and aerobic glycolysis in clear cell renal cell carcinoma cells.
