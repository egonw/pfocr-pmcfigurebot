caption: Proposed schematic diagram of celastrol forming covalent Michael adducts
  through the binding of electrophilic sites with the nucleophilic thiol groups of
  cysteine residues and directly binding targets. (A) Celastrol suppresses NF-κB activation
  by inhibiting IKKα and IKKβ activity and inhibiting IκBα phosphorylation to decrease
  degradation of IκBα. (B) Celastrol activates HSF1 to up regulate a wider set of
  potentially neuroprotective HSPs. Different from the existing N-terminal HSP90 inhibitor,
  celastrol covalently binds to HSP90 co-chaperone Cdc37 and p23 to disrupt the Cdc37-HSP90
  or p23-HSP90 complex. (C) Celastrol directly binds to HMGB1 and inhibits the proinflammatory
  activity of disulfide isoform HMGB1. (D) Celastrol promotes mitochondrial ubiquitination
  and autophagy by covalently binding to Nur77 and inducing Nur77 interaction with
  TRAF2 to inhibit the classical IKK/NF-κB pathway. (E) Celastrol is a direct and
  selective CB2 agonist and triggers several CB2-mediated downstream signaling pathways
  to reduce inflammatory responses. (F) Celastrol directly binds and inhibits STAT3
  tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. (G) Celastrol accelerates the
  degradation of hnRNPA1 by directly binding with it and modulates hnRNPA1-IκBα-NF-κB-TNF-α
  pathway.
