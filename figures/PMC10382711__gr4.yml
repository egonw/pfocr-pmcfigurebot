caption: BCL11B-regulated transcription programs in MSNs and CTX neurons overlap with
  mHTT–coregulated pathways. (A) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis of differentially expressed genes at false discovery rate padj
  < .01 shows a significant enrichment of genes regulating cAMP-PKA-calcium signaling
  axis and synaptic signaling in both neuron types as well as DA-DARPP32 signaling
  specifically in MSNs (full gene set lists are presented in ). (B) BCL11B target
  genes within shortlisted core biological processes affected by the loss of BCL11B
  in MSN and CTX neurons. Next to gene name, color icons indicate significant association
  (differential expression or identified risk variant) with HD (pink), SCZ (green),
  NDD (blue), and ASD (yellow). (C) Exclusion of BCL11B target genes from differentially
  expressed gene list results in several pathways in MSNs becoming either drastically
  less significant or not significant at all, including cAMP-PKA-calcium signaling
  axis pathways and dopamine synapse signaling, while having almost no effect on signaling
  pathways in CTX neurons. (D) BCL11B-regulated signaling abnormalities in MSNs and
  CTX neurons are shared by HD neurons (full gene set lists are presented in ). In
  pathway graphs (A, D), dot size corresponds to gene set size, dot color corresponds
  to −log10(pval), where p_adj < .05 dot is framed inside a black circle. See also  and  and
