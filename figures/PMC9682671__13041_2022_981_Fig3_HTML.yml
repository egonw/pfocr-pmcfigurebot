caption: 'Transcriptomic evidence for the immature dentate gyrus phenotype in Cn mutant
  mice. a Volcano plot showing the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified
  by microarray analysis. b Pathway enrichment analysis of the DEGs using BaseSpace.
  Full list is available in the Additional file : Table S4. c The gene expression
  pattern in the DG of adult Cn mutant mice (mutants compared to controls) was compared
  with typically developing infant mice (2-week-old vs. 4-week-old wild-type mice).
  d Venn diagram illustrating the overlap in transcriptome‐wide gene expression changes
  in the DG of adult Cn mutant mice and infant mice. e P‐values of overlap between
  the adult Cn mutant mice and infant mice in the DG datasets. Bar graphs illustrate
  the P‐values of overlap of genes upregulated (red arrows) or downregulated (blue
  arrows) by each condition, between the two conditions. f Overlap P-values and the
  number of common genes/transcripts responsive to both conditions for each pair of
  interest. iDG mouse, mouse with immature dentate gyrus (iDG) phenotypes'
