figure_title: FMRP is upregulated in GBM and is associated with worst outcome
caption: A Representative histological section from GBM patients stained with hematoxylin/eosin
  (H&E) (A, C) and after immunostaining for FMRP (B, D). FMRP is mostly observed as
  diffuse cytoplasmic staining; most cells in D, but only few in B, show FMRP staining.
  Scale bar, 50 µm. B Kaplan–Meier survival curve of GBM patients stratified by FMRP
  expression. Low FMRP expression (blue line; 25 cases; median survival 26 months)
  was significantly associated to a better patient overall survival (OS) (P = 0.016;
  HR 0.45; 95% CI from 0.24 to 0.86) respect to high FMRP levels (red line; 35 cases;
  median survival 12 months). C Quantification of FMRP expression in 28 GSCs. Values
  were normalised for Coomassie staining and are shown relative to FMRP levels in
  NSC and HPNC10 control cells, the average of which is set to 1 (mean ± SEM, technical
  replicates for each GSC line). D Kaplan–Meier survival curve of GBM patients showed
  that low FMRP expression (blue line; 17 GSC lines; median survival 12 months) was
  significantly associated to a better OS (P = 0.042; HR 0.389; 95% CI from 0.15 to
  0.98) respect to high FMRP levels (red line; 11 GSC lines; median survival 8 months).
