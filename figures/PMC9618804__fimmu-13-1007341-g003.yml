caption: Transcriptome sequencing results and IPA analysis. (A) The differential gene
  distribution (fold change ≥ 1.5 and p value ≤ 0.01) among the sham group, I/R (Model)
  group and GXNI 9 mL/kg group was displayed through a volcano graph. The abscissa
  and ordinate represented the fold change and the significance level of the difference
  in expression of the gene, respectively. Red dots were the up-regulated genes, and
  green dots were the down-regulated genes. (B) Hierarchical cluster analysis among
  samples of sham group, I/R group and GXNI (9 mL/kg) group. Each group included three
  independent animals (n = 3). (C) Venn diagram of MIRI group vs. Sham group and GXNI
  group vs. MIRI group. (D) List of the top 10 genes with up-regulated fold change
  and the top 10 genes with down-regulated fold change among the 3060 DEGs shared
  by I/R model vs. sham and GXNI vs. I/R model. (E) Core analysis revealed the top
  20 pathways of 3060 DEGs which were arranged in descending order according to -log
  (p-value), with IL-8 signal pathway being number one. (F) The schematic diagram
  of the interaction of genes in the IL-8 signaling pathway. (G) Gene targets that
  are regulated by GXNI in IL-8 signaling pathway. (H) A schematic diagram of gene
  interactions in CXCR1-NF-κB-COX-2/ICAM-1/VCAM-1 pathway. In A–H, GXNI-regulated
  genes in the transcriptome data are color labeled, with green representing down-regulation
  and brown representing up-regulation.
