caption: 'TNBC, Hs 578T and MDA-MB-468 cells, or normal human breast epithelial cells,
  MCF-10A in culture were treated with 0.1% DMSO or ICA (12.5, 25, and 50 μM). (A–C)
  CCK-8 assays determined the viability of Hs 578T, MDA-MB-468, or MCF-10A cells after
  24 h or 48 h; n = 3. (D and E) The viability of MDA-MB-468 and Hs 578T cells were
  measured by Muse cell analyzer after 24 h treatment; n = 3. (F and G) EdU staining
  assays were conducted to verify MDA-MB-468 and Hs 578T cell proliferation; n = 3.
  Data are presented in triplicate as mean ± SD. **p < 0.01, compared with the control
  group; ##p < 0.01, compared with the experimental group. Bar: 75 μm.'
