caption: 'Expression of various astrocyte genes and signaling pathways. A Functional
  ATP assay measuring ATP levels in optic nerve head tissues from control and 30 days
  microbead injected animals. MB = microbead injected. N = 4 for each group. Mean ± SEM.
  * p < 0.05. B Mitochondrial biogenesis in optic nerve head tissues from control
  and 30 days microbead injected animals. MB = microbead injected. N = 4 for each
  group. Mean ± SEM. ** p < 0.01. C Changes in the proportion of cellular ATP derived
  from glycolysis versus oxidative phosphorylation in response to elevated IOP within
  optic nerve head tissues. Oligomycin was used to inhibit ATP synthesis by oxidative
  phosphorylation. N = 4 for each group. Mean ± SEM. *** p < 0.01. D Reactive oxygen
  species was measured using DHE (dihydroethidium) labeling of live unfixed longitudinal
  sections of the optic nerve. E Log2 fold change values for various astrocyte genes,
  as determined in the differential expression analysis of the 3 independent time
  point pairwise comparisons. Astericks indicate significant differences between the
  2 groups (adjusted p-value < 0.05). F Log2 fold change values for reactive astrocytes
  genes, as determined in the differential expression analysis of the 3 independent
  time point pairwise comparisons. Astericks indicate significant differences between
  the 2 groups (adjusted p-value < 0.05). G Gene set enrichment analysis on the 3
  time point pairwise comparisons against a user defined subset of the GO, KEGG and
  Reactome pathway, focusing on key reactivity and injury signaling pathways: nuclear
  factor kappa B (NFkB), calcineurin-nuclear factor activating of T-cells (CaN-NFAT),
  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), janus kinases/signal transducer and activator
  of transcription (JAK/STAT), Wnt/b-catenin, and sonic hedgehog (adjusted p-value < 0.05).
