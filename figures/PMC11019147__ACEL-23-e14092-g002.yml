caption: Reactive oxygen species (ROS)‐related signaling pathway in osteoclast. ROS
  mediate osteoclast activation is closely related to age‐associated alterations.
  ROS production is indispensable for downstream signaling transduction. However,
  during the aging process, the generation of ROS is robustly increased due to mitochondrial
  dysfunction and a disordered scavenger system, thus resulting in the upregulation
  of osteoclastic gene expression. AP1, activator protein‐1; DOCK, dedicator of cytokinesis;
  ELMO, engulfment and cell motility; ERK, extracellular regulated MAP kinase; FOXO,
  forkhead box protein; GDP, guanosine diphosphate; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase
  3beta; GTP, guanosine triphosphate; IKKα, inhibitor of NF‐κB kinase subunit α; IKKβ,
  inhibitor of NF‐κB kinase subunit β; IκBα, NF‐kappa‐B inhibitor α; JNK, c‐Jun N‐terminal
  kinase; MAPK, mitogen‐activated protein kinases; NEMO, NF‐κB essential modulator;
