caption: 'Glucose metabolism changes in PMCs(A) KEGG enrichment analysis of up-regulated
  genes in the long-term group. The histogram shows the first 20 most enriched gene
  sets, and the blue depth of the histogram represents the significant level.(B) Up-regulated
  enzymes in glycolysis pathway in the long-term group compared with the short-term
  group, PGM: glucose phosphate mutase, GPI: glucose phosphate isomerase, ALDO: fructose-diphosphate
  aldolase, GAPA: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, PGAM: phosphoglycerate
  mutase, ENO: enolase, PK: pyruvate kinase, ACEE: pyruvate dehydrogenase E1, G6PC:
  glucose-6-phosphatase, TPI: phosphopyranose isomerase. BPGM: diphosphoglycerate
  synthase, and LDH: lactate dehydrogenase.(C) The regulation potential heatmap of
  ligand-target gene in signal pathway, X axis is the specific signal pathway in PMCs,
  Y axis is ligand-target gene pair in DC-PMCs, the regulatory potential of ligand
  on target gene is represented by different colors, and the color depth indicates
  the regulatory potential of ligand-target gene on the pathway.'
