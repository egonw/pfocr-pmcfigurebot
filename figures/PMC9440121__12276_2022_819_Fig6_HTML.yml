figure_title: YAP regulates the expression of Ang2 via the Akt1 signaling pathway
caption: a Akt1 or Akt2 was silenced in VSMCs, and cells were stimulated with PDGF-BB
  for 30 min and stained with YAP (red) antibody. Bar, 50 μm. b Quantification of
  nuclear YAP expression (n = 7 for vector, n = 7–15 for shAkt1, n = 6 for shAkt2).
  *P < 0.05, one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test. The transcriptional
  activity of YAP was measured either after silencing (c) or overexpressing d Akt
  isoforms (n = 3). *P < 0.05, one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison
  test. After silencing YAP in VSMCs, the expression of Ang2 was verified by western
  blotting, RT–PCR, qPCR (e) and immunocytochemistry f (n = 3). Bar, 50 μm. *P < 0.05,
  Student’s t test. g Fluorescence intensity of YAP (n = 8) and Ang2 (n = 6) was quantified
  with Student’s t test. *P < 0.05. YAP was ectopically expressed in VSMCs, and the
  expression of Ang2 was verified by western blotting, RT–PCR, qPCR (h) and immunocytochemistry
  i (n = 3). Bar, 50 μm. *P < 0.05, Student’s t test. j The fluorescence intensity
  of Ang2 (n = 9) was quantified with Student’s t test. *P < 0.05. k After overexpression
  of Akt1 or YAP in VSMCs, the promoter activity of Ang2 was verified (n = 3). After
  silencing Akt1 or YAP, the promoter activity of Ang2 was verified (n = 3–6). *P < 0.05,
  Student’s t test. The data are presented as the mean ± SEM.
