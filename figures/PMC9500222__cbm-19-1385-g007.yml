caption: Schematic model of this study. The missense variant rs3769823 was the causal
  variant in 2q33.1. The K14R alteration resulted in higher expression of caspase-8,
  and greater binding of caspase-8 and FADD, thus promoting TRAIL-mediated apoptosis
  and inhibiting NSCLC tumorigenesis (image created with BioRender.com).
