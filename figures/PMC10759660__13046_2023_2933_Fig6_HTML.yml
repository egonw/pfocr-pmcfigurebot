caption: 'In vitro effect of metformin and CR treatments on PI3K/AKT proliferative
  pathway: Representative immunoblot analysis of total and different phosphorylated
  forms of the serine/threonine kinase AKT in KRASG12D (A) and KRASG12D/LKB1del(B)
  cell lines. C-F Bar graphs of the quantification analysis of the different active
  forms of AKT normalized on RAN, used as housekeeping. Proteins were extracted after
  72 h of treatment with 2 mM of metformin (MET) and 50% caloric restriction (CR).
  Non-treated cells were used as control. One-way ANOVA was used for statistical analysis
  and no statistically significant results were highlighted. Error bars indicate SD'
article_title: Caloric restriction and metformin selectively improved LKB1-mutated
  NSCLC tumor response to chemo- and chemo-immunotherapy.
