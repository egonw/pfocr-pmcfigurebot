caption: 'Simulation of zonal induction of Cyp1A1 by TCDD. (A,B) Zonal induction profiles
  of Cyp1A1 and BAT at various doses of TCDD. (C) The zonation index, representing
  the percentage changes in Cyp1A1 expression across the lobule, relative to the TCDD
  doses. (D)Simplified diagram of the signaling pathway network to highlight the three
  main regulators of zonal Cyp1A1 induction by TCDD: Wnt signaling, negative feedback
  induced by Cyp1A2 binding to TCDD, and the cooperation of regulatory transcription
  factors β‐catenin and the BAT complex. (E) Zonal induction of Cyp1A1 in the model
  compared with immunostaining results at different doses of TCDD. Immunostaining
  pictures reproduced from Tritscher et al.(3) Abbreviation: Cyp1A2_T, Cyp1A2‐TCDD
  molecular complex.'
