caption: Cortex-specific pathway analysis of trascriptome changes by limma after BCAS-hypoperfusion.
  (A) PCA plot of cortex-specific RNA-seq obtained from sham and BCAS mice. N = 4
  for each group. (B) Up-regulated and down-regulated functional pathways analyzed
  by GSEA (BCAS vs. Sham) NES, normalized enrichment score. Notice high enrichment
  for IFN-beta signaling pathways. (Câ€“F) (Up) Enrichment plots and (Bottom) IGV map
  tracks for representative genes in the up-regulated and down-regulated pathways.
  Notice increases of RNA-seq signal for IFN-regulated genes (IFi204, Gbp2) and activation
  of innate immune genes (Ifi209, Tlr2) in BCAS group compared to sham mice, accompanied
  by decreases of RNA-seq signal for neuronal-activity related genes (Npas4, Grin1,
  Nptx1, Nptx2).
