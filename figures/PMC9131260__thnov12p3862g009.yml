caption: haFGF14-154 inhibits AEP activity via miR-206-3p/BDNF pathway in the brain
  of APP/PS1 mice. (A-C) miR-206-3p level in the PFC and hippocampal DG region of
  APP/PS1 mice with intranasal administration of 600 µg/kg haFGF14-154-loaded cationic
  liposomes (L+H600) or 0.9% saline (vehicle), measured by fluorescence in situ hybridization
  (FISH), n = 4/5. (D-F) The expression of BDNF and AEP (full-length and cleaved AEP)
  in the PFC of APP/PS1 mice with intranasal administration of L+H600 or vehicle,
  n = 6. The plasma levels of miR-206-3p (G) and BDNF (H) in patients with Alzheimer's
  disease (AD), PD and Schizophrienia detected by qPCR. P values are calculated by
  age-adjusted ANCOVA model with Tukey's post-hoc test. n = 25/16, 18/18, 15/13 and
  12/8 for normal control and patients with AD, PD and Schizophrienia in the experiments
  of qPCR and ELISA, respectively. Data are mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p
  < 0.001. P values are calculated by one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc test and
  student's t-test.
