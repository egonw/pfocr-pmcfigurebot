caption: Enrichment pathway of genes and metabolites in FL478 under salt stress mediated
  by alginate oligosaccharides. Glutathione metabolic pathway (A). Ascorbic acid and
  erythrosine metabolic pathway (B). The red highlighted areas in A and B represent
  significantly upregulated genes or metabolite levels. Blue represents significantly
  downregulated genes or metabolites with reduced abundance. Used with permission
