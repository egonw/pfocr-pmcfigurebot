caption: Schematic showing that after spinal cord injury, IL1α induces astrocyte proliferation
  by inhibiting Grin2c, resulting in decreased intracellular Ca2+ concentration and
  CaMK2b levels. In response to the blockade of IL1α via neutralizing antibodies,
  Grin2c/Ca2+/CaMK2b pathway levels increase, and astrocyte proliferation decreases.
