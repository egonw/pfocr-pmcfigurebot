caption: 'KEGG Parkinson disease pathway (hsa05012). The red boxes indicate the pathways
  involved by TRF and levodopa, green shaded boxes are proteins that were differentially
  regulated by (T) TRF and (L) levodopa in differ-neural cells. The proteins behind
  the KEGG symbol are as follows: UCHL1:UCHL1, CaM: CALM1, CALM2, CALM3, Bip: HSPA5,
  mPTP: SLC25A6, VDAC1, VDAC3, CxV: ATP5F1A, TUBA/TUBB: TUBA1B, TUBB, TUBB2B, TUBB3,
  TUBB4B, TUBB6 (Adapted from KEGG-Parkinson’s disease pathway- hsa05012 with permission
  from Ref. []. 2019. Kanehisa, M.).'
