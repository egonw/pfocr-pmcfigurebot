caption: 'Mechanisms of hyperglycemia-mediated PI3K inhibitor resistance. Constitutively
  active PI3KÎ± leads to the transport of GLUT4 vesicles to the cell membrane, causing
  glucose uptake into cancer cells. PI3K inhibition limits downstream pathway activation
  in tumor and non-tumor cells. GLUT4 vesicles are no longer transferred to the cell
  membrane as an on-target negative consequence, leading to extracellular hyperglycemia.
  This stimulates excess insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells, binding to IRs
  on cancer cells. Overactivation of the IR overcomes the PI3Ki effect, partially
  reactivating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. This effect can also be mediated by exogenous
  insulin. Minimizing hyperglycemia through fasting, metformin or SGLT-2 inhibition
  reduces insulin secretion, restoring the effectiveness of PI3K inhibition. GLUT4:
  glucose transporter type 4; PI3Ki: PI3K inhibition'
