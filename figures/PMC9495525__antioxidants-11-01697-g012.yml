caption: Protective role of OLNZ against the H2O2-mediated phosphorylation of ERK,
  JNK, p38, and NF-KB protein in SH-SY5Y cells. The expression (% of (A) pP38, (B)
  pERK, (C) pJNK, and (D) pNF-KB proteins decreased after pretreatment with OLNZ in
  H2O2-induced SH-SY5Y cells. Data were presented as the mean Â± SEM, and the experiment
  was repeated three times. (#) compared to the control and (*) compared to H2O2,
  p < 0.05.
