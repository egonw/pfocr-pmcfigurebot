caption: HIF-1α regulation by altering HIF-1α synthesis, stability, or transactivation.
  The HIF-1α synthesis is mediated by the PI3K-AKT pathway and the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK
  kinase cascade upon activation by growth factors. Afterwards, HIF-1α is either degraded
  via pVHL or p53/Mdm2 related ubiquitination, or it translocates to the nucleus.
  There, it forms a heterodimer with HIF-1β and is coactivated by p300 leading to
  transcriptional activation of target genes. This can be enhanced by ERK expression
  or inhibited by FIH-1. Created with BioRender.com, accessed on VN24CTMQMS, 9 July
