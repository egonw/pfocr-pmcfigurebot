caption: Effect of cGAS‐STING pathway activator on the radiosensitivity of NSCLC cells.
  Cells pretreated with 20 nM diABZI or DMSO were treated with IR (0, 2 and 4 Gy),
  and cell proliferation of (a, b) H460 and (c, d) A549 cells were measured using
  CCK‐8 and colony formation assays. (a, c) CCK‐8, and (b, d) colony formation assays.
  In (b) and (d) the left panel is representative images of colonies and the right
  panel shows quantification of colonies. Each experiment was repeated at least three
  times. *p <0.05; **p <0.01
