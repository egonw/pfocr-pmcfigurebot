caption: Correlation between sphingolipid with clinical characteristics, microbial
  diversity and flora distribution in bronchiectasis patients. (A) Sphingosine, the
  important metabolites of sphingolipid pathway, were significantly different between
  bronchiectasis and the control groups. Sphingosine levels were significantly lower
  in bronchiectasis patients with P. aeruginosa infection than in bronchiectasis patients
  without P. aeruginosa infection. *Indicates P<0.05, **indicates P<0.01; ***indicates
  P<0.001. (B) Sphingosine and dihydrosphingosine were associated with bacterial diversity
  (Shannon Index). (C) The association of microbial diversity in the lower respiratory
  tract with several important metabolites of sphingolipid metabolic pathways.
