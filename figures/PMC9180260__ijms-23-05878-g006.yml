caption: 'Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) synthesis pathway and analysis. (a) The three
  metabolic pathways involved in BH4 production, the de novo (blue), salvage (yellow),
  and recycling pathway (green). The synthesis of BH4 begins at the “de novo” pathway,
  starting from guanosine triphosphate (GTP) catalyzed by the following enzymes: GTP
  cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1) modulated by the GTP cyclohydrolase 1 feedback regulator
  (GCHFR), 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthesis (PTPS), and sepiapterin reductase
  (SPR). Additionally, the final step can be influenced by two enzymes: aldoketo reductase
  (AR) and carbonyl reductase (CR). Alternatively, the “salvage pathway” involves
  SPR and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). The “recycling pathway” involves the regeneration
  of BH4 from quinonoid dihydrobiopterin (BH2) with the following enzymes: pterin-4α-carbinolamine
  dehydratase (PCBD) and quinoid dihydropteridine reductase (QDPR). (b) Cluster heatmap
  of BH4 synthesis visualized under different conditions: pain model (infraorbital
  nerve constriction (IONC) + no treatment) and tranilast-treated group at the 6th
  and 24th hours (IONC + tranilast treatment) compared to the control group. The heat
  map shows the normalized 2−∆∆CT values. n = 6 per group.'
