figure_title: CP treatment alters cellular metabolism in HepG2 cells
caption: '(A) Heatmap analysis highlighting metabolites showing significant change
  (p<0.05) in HepG2 cells with CP-91149 (50 μM) treatment for 16 hr. (B) Metabolome
  view: each circle represents a different pathway; circle size and color shade are
  based on the pathway impact and significance (red being the most significant), respectively.
  The most impacted pathways having statistical significance scores (p<0.05) are annotated.
  (C) Glucose metabolic pathway showing the primary metabolites (represented in bold
  letters) in HepG2 cells with CP-91149 (50 μM) treatment for 16 hr (pathway significance
  p<0.05 *; metabolite significance p<0.05 #, p<0.001 ##).'
