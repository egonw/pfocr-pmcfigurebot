caption: 'Inhibition of MLK3 reduces inflammatory responses mediated by AP-1 in LPS-activated
  RAW264.7 cells. (a) Chemical structure of URMC-099. (b) Viability of RAW264.7 and
  HEK292 cells under URMC-099 treatment conditions was evaluated by MTT assay. (c,d)
  The mRNA expression levels of COX-2 and CCL-12 were determined by RT-PCR and real-time
  PCR from RAW264.7 cells stimulated with LPS. (e,f,h). The phospho- and total forms
  of MLK3, c-Jun, JNK, p38, and ERK were detected from whole cell lysates of RAW264.7
  cells stimulated with LPS by immunoblotting analysis. (g) Luciferase activity mediated
  by AP-1 in HEK293 cells transfected with AP-1-Luc as well as TRIF or MyD88 in the
  presence or absence of URMC-099 was determined by luminometer. Results (b,d,g) are
  expressed as mean Â± SD. # p < 0.05 and ## p < 0.01 compared to the normal group
  (no treatment) and * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 compared to the control group (LPS,
  MyD88, or TRIF alone).'
