caption: Genetic characterization and β‐catenin activation of CRC‐derived organoid
  lines. (A) Mutations of the CRC driver genes identified in the respective CRC‐derived
  organoid lines. The variants of mutations are indicated. Con, conventional pathway
  CRC; Ser, serrated pathway CRC. (B) The results of CIMP analyses for classic CIMP
  markers (top) and new CIMP markers (bottom). The methylation levels for each marker
  in C14, C24, and C45 cells are indicated as a heatmap. (C) The results of microsatellite
  instability (MSI) marker analyses in BAT25, BAT26, D2S123, and D5S346. Arrows indicate
  different patterns from other organoid lines. (D) Immunoblotting results for active
  β‐catenin and total β‐catenin in the respective organoid lines (top). GAPDH was
  used as an internal control. Normalized band intensities relative to the NC8 level
  are indicated in the bar graph (bottom).
