caption: Effect of TmToll-2 gene silencing on NF-kB gene expression. dsTmToll-2 RNAi-treated
  T. molitor larvae were infected with E. coli, S. aureus, and C. albicans; at 24
  h post pathogen injection, the mRNA levels of the NF-kB pathway genes TmDorX1, TmDorX2,
  and TmRelish in the whole body (A), fat bodies (B), gut (C), and Malpighian tubules
  (D) were measured via RT-qPCR. The expression level of TmDorx2 was suppressed following
  E. coli and S. aureus infection in all the examined tissues, while the level of
  TmRelish was not affected. In the fat bodies and gut, the NF-κB genes expression
  was negatively regulated. TmVer dsRNA was assessed as a negative control, and T.
  molitor ribosomal protein (TmL27a) was used as an internal control. All experiments
  were performed in triplicate. Asterisks indicate significant differences between
  dsTmToll-2- and dsTmVer RNAi-treated groups determined using Student’s t-test (p
  < 0.05).
