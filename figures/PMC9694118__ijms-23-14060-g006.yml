caption: 'Network pharmacological prediction. (A) The Venn diagram of AECR targets
  and thrombocytopenia targets. Blue: AECR targets. Red: thrombocytopenia targets.
  Pink: common targets. (B) The AECR–ingredient–target–thrombocytopenia network. (C)
  The PPI network shows the targets of AECRs against thrombocytopenia with a combined
  score of >0.7, a degree of ≥23, a BC of ≥0.004028, and a CC of ≥0.443925. (D) GO
  enrichment analysis (p < 0.01). (E) Bubble plot of 11 KEGG pathways of AECRs in
  the treatment of thrombocytopenia. Greater enrichment is reflected in a larger fold
  enrichment. The size of the bubble represents the number of enriched genes in each
  pathway. The color of the bubble represents the Log10 range (p-value). (F) The AECR–ingredient–target–thrombocytopenia
  pathway network. “**” stands for p < 0.01. AECRs: aqueous extracts of Cibotii rhizoma.'
