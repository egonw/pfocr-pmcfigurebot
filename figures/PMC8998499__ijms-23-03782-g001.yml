caption: Indirect, direct and postinfectious mechanisms of neurotoxicity due to SARS-CoV-2
  infection. The indirect mechanisms result from pulmonary, hepatic, cardiovascular,
  and renal injuries, as well as from the side effects of hospitalization treatments.
  Indirect neurotoxicity may derive also from an abnormal host response called “cytokine
  storm”, characterized by an increased release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The
  direct mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 neurotoxicity originate from the straight viral
  diffusion into the brain through the hematogenous pathway and/or the neuronal pathway.
  The hematogenous pathway consists of the entry of peripheral immune infected cells
  into the brain by the blood–brain barrier (BBB). In the neuronal pathway, viruses
  reach the nerve endings and, by a mechanism of retrograde active transport, reach
  the central nervous system by a synapse-connected route. Here, the entry through
  the olfactory epithelium and olfactory nerve is shown. Post-infectious mechanisms
  stem mainly from molecular mimicry between human coronaviruses and myelin basic
  protein (antibodies attacking myelin sheath and a phagocytosing macrophage are represented).
