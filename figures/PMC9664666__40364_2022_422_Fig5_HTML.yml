caption: SGOL2 exerted its effect by forming a SGOL2-MAD2 complex. A SK-HEP-1 and
  HEP3B cells were transfected with shSGOL2 lentivirus or SGOL2 plasmid. The colocalization
  between SGOL2 (Red) and MAD2 (Green) was visualized as yellow fluorescence in the
  merged panel by Confocal microscopy. B The endogenous interaction between SGOL2
  and MAD2 was detected by IP assays in HCC cells
article_title: SGOL2 is a novel prognostic marker and fosters disease progression
  via a MAD2-mediated pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma.
