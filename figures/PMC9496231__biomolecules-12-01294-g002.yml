  plots of the significantly differentially expressed mRNAs at the criteria of |log2(foldchange)|
  > 1 and q value < 0.05. (B) Heatmap plots of the significantly differentially expressed
  mRNAs. GO (C) and KEGG (D) analysis diagram of DE mRNAs upregulated in LW pigs.
  GO (E) and KEGG (F) analysis diagram of DE mRNAs downregulated in LW pigs. (G) Validation
  by RT-qPCR of 10 randomly selected DE mRNAs from RNA-seq. (H) Heatmap plots of the
  DE mRNAs in metabolic pathway.
