caption: 'Differential metabolic profiles and characteristic metabolites in tissues
  from control and l-lactate mice (n = 7). (A) Venn diagram displaying metabolites
  in different samples. (B) Score plot of the OPLS-DA model shows distinct clustering
  of metabolites for different groups of mice. Each point represents one variable
  (metabolite). Metabolic patterns were also grouped by different colored circles
  according to the tissues. (C) Fold change of metabolites in l-lactate mice, compared
  to controls, and the corresponding metabolic pathway. The darker border represents
  a positive fold change compared to controls, while no border indicates a negative
  fold change compared to controls. (D) VIP rank-score of metabolites of hepatic extracts.
  Keys: MET, metabolic pathway; OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation.'
article_title: A combined metabolomics and molecular biology approach to reveal hepatic
  injury and underlying mechanisms after chronic l-lactate exposure in mice.
