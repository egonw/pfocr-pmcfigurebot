caption: Auxin signaling pathway. When auxin levels are low, Aux/IAAs and the TPL
  corepressor together repress transcription. ARFs bind to DNA at the C-terminal DNA
  binding domain (DBD) and its transcriptional activity is repressed through interaction
  between the ARF N-terminal PB1 domain and the Aux/IAA PB1 domain. TPL recruits histone
  deacetylases and also interacts with Mediator to prevent ARF transcriptional output.
  Under elevated auxin levels, the hormone promotes SCFTIR/AFB-Auxin-Aux/IAA association
  and stimulates Aux/IAA polyubiquitylation and degradation via proteasome. Once free
  from TPL and Aux/IAA repression, the mediator and ARF transcriptional machinery
  recruits RNA polymerase II and gene expression is initiated, inducing auxin-responsive
  transcription.
