caption: 'KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of 835 shared DEGs during M. incognita
  infection. (A) The top 20 pathways; (B) Expression level of genes related to lignin
  biosynthesis pathway. Each row represented four comparison groups (A0_B0, A1_B1,
  A2_B2 and A3_B3) from left to right. The log2|A/B| was colored using TBtools []:
  red color indicated the DEG was up-regulated, and green color indicated it was down-regulated.'
