caption: (A) Caspase inhibitory activity in cancer HL60 and HepG2 cells was treated
  with compounds (4) and (8b), respectively, for 48 h, using the “CellEvent® Caspase
  3/7 Green Flow Cytometry kit”, where “L, viable cells; A, apoptotic cells; N, necrotic
  cells; and D, dead cells”. (B) Graphical presentation of a comparison of apoptotic
  cancer cells due to active caspases 3/7 of the tested compounds. The data are expressed
  as the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments in triplicate.
