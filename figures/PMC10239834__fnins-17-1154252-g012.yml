caption: Model-3 responses to optic flow and translational motion sequences. In (A,B),
  first and second columns display the frame of an optic flow sequence and the corresponding
  VSMN response, respectively. “Conv1 Resp”—indicates the activity on 36 feature maps
  of convolution layer. In (C–F), first, second, and third columns display the frame
  of a translational sequence, corresponding VSMN response, and the convolution layer
  activity, respectively. Out of 36 feature maps, the channel with the maximum response
  is plotted in the fourth column as “Max Channel.”
