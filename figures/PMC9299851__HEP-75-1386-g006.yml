caption: 'Increased glucose flux to CL anabolism in radioresistant HCC cells. (A)
  13C‐labeled glycolytic and TCA metabolites as identified by gas chromatographic–mass
  spectrometric analysis and corresponding protein expression of indicated enzymes
  in glycolysis from proteomic analyses. Red indicates overexpressed enzymes in MHCC97H
  IR‐R cells, n = 3/group. (B) Metabolic pathway impact analysis of metabolites by
  Metaboanalyst 3.0 based on results of liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry–based
  untargeted metabolomics, n = 3/group. (C) Relative expression levels of up‐regulated
  and down‐regulated lipid species displayed as log2 fold change in MHCC97H IR‐R compared
  to MHCC97H cells. Each spot represents a species of lipids, and the spot size indicates
  significance. Red indicates species of GPLs, n = 6/group. (D) Quantitative RT‐PCR
  and western blots of genes involved in CL synthesis. (E) Relative CL content in
  cells under basal conditions or at 24 h after 8 Gy IR as determined by ELISA. Data
  were calculated relative to respective untreated or 8 Gy‐treated controls. Data
  are represented as mean ± SEM of at least three replicates. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001. Abbreviations: ADPGK, ADP‐dependent glucokinase; AGPAT2/4,
