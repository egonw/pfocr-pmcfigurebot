caption: Schematic showing BBS mechanisms involved in regulating hypoxia and immunosuppressive
  microenvironment in breast cancer. By aggravating hypoxia tumor microenvironment,
  BSSs promote HIF1-α expression, thus upregulating VEGF and Cyclin D1 through the
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which promoted tumor angiogenesis; additionally,
  HIF1-α promotes the immunosuppressive microenvironment formation, thereby promoting
  the growth and metastasis of tumor cells.
