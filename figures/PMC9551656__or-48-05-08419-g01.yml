caption: 'OTX1 promotes proliferation of cervical cancer cells. (A) Reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR and western blotting showed that OTX1 expression was decreased following OTX1
  siRNAs transfection and (B) increased following OTX1 pcDNA3.1 transfection. (C)
  MTT assay showed cell viability following transfection with OTX1 siRNAs and pcDNA3.1.
  (D) EdU assay for proliferation following transfection with OTX1 siRNAs and pcDNA3.1
  (scale bar, 100 µm). (E) Colony formation assay following transfection with OTX1
  siRNAs and pcDNA3.1 (magnification, ×40). All experiments were performed in triplicate.
  *P<0.05 vs. si-NC; #P<0.05 vs. pc-NC. OTX1, orthodenticle homolog 1; si, small interfering;
  NC, negative control; OD, optical density.'
