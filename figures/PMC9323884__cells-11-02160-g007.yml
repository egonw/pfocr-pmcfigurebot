caption: 'Network representation of the modular pattern of gene expression during
  the transition of control to TP-472 treatment. (A) Flowchart of modular pattern
  analysis, (B) Left: Nine network modules are color coded. Middle and right: Overlay
  of gene expression z-scores for all genes in the control and TP-472 conditions shown
  in blue (low) to red (high) z-score color scale. Four constructed modules, including
  mitotic cell cycle phase (GO: 0044772), regulation of mitochondrial outer membrane
  permeabilization involved in apoptotic signaling pathway (GO:1901028), apoptotic
  process (GO: 9996915), and translational termination (GO: 0006415) were enriched
  and highlighted. Note: Greek numerals are the index for Modules.'
