caption: si-DLEU2 suppresses oral cancer cell growth via the MAPK pathway. (a) Western
  blot analysis of si-DLEU2-mediated protein levels of RAP1B, p38, and p-p38. (b)
  Western blot analysis of si-DLEU2-/ov-RAP1B-mediated protein levels of RAP1B, p38,
  and p-p38. (c, d) CCK8 analysis of the effect of si-DLEU2/ov-RAP1B coaction on the
  proliferation rate of Tca8113 (c) and CAL-27 (d) cells. (e, f) Transwell analysis
  of the effect of si-DLEU2/ov-RAP1B coaction on migration and invasion of Tca8113
  (e) and CAL-27 (f) cells. âˆ—P < 0.05.
