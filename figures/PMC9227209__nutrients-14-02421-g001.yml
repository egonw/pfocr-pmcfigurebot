caption: Molecular pathways underpinning the effects of AGEs in the pathogenesis of
  neurologicognitive and mental disorders. AGEs bind to the RAGE receptor located
  on the blood–brain barrier, which allows AGEs to enter the brain and to also activate
  RAGE signalling []. RAGE signalling activates nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) within
  glial cells, resulting in the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) production within the brain []. The neuroinflammation and ROS
  support amyloid beta (β) production and promote neuronal cell death []. RAGE signalling
  and production downregulates specific AGE detoxification pathways, involving the
  ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy [,]. This impaired detoxification
  further contributes to intracellular AGEs accumulation and upregulating amyloid
  precursor proteins (APP), leading to amyloid β production []. AGEs form cross-links
  with aggregate tau protein and alpha-synuclein [,], in addition to possibly impairing
  the brain’s microstructure through protein cross-links []. AGEs may reduce the brain-derived
  neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) signalling pathway,
  thereby impairing neuroplasticity []. ↑ = increase/upregulate, ↓ = decrease/downregulate.
