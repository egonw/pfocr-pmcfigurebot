figure_title: MELK is required for xCT-mediated CRC tumorigenesis and AKT/mTOR signaling
caption: 'A, B The colony formation assay showed that the suppressive effect of xCT
  inhibition on the proliferation of CRC cells was reversed by MELK upregulation.
  C, D Transwell assays indicated that MELK overexpression effectively recovered the
  migration capability inhibited by xCT knockdown in CRC cells. E, F Cell cycle assay
  confirmed that MELK rescued the suppression of xCT inhibition on G1/S transition.
  G, H The sphere formation assay indicated that upregulated MELK rescued the suppressive
  effect of xCT inhibition on the sphere-forming capability of CRC cells. I The interaction
  of MELK with different factors expressed in various organelles. J, K GSEA indicated
  that upregulated expression of MELK was closely related to the activation of signaling
  pathways, including hallmark_mTORC1_signaling and hallmark_MYC_targets_V1. L, M
  Western blot analysis confirmed that upregulated MELK rescued the suppression of
  the expression of tumorigenesis- and stemness-related factors in CRC cells with
  xCT knockdown. N, O The suppressive effect of xCT knockdown on the AKT/mTOR signaling
  pathway was rescued by MELK overexpression. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001,
  #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01.'
