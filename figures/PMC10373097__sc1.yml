caption: Schematic illustration of an NIR-II fluorescence image-guided light-triggerable
  vaccine combined with SV that enhances anticancer immunity through promoting both
  antigen cross-presentation and MHC II expression. The mice pretreated with SV were
  immunized with antigen-BPBBT-Lipo150 in the footpad. Under the NIR-II fluorescence
  imaging, the lymphatic drainage and distribution of the liposomal vaccines in the
  draining (popliteal) lymph node (PLN) were visualized so as to guide the NIR (808Â nm)
  laser irradiation. Pretreatment with SV inhibits the Rab5 lipidation, leading to
  the arrested endosomal maturation and the prolonged antigen retention. The photothermal
  conversion effect of BPBBT disrupts the endolysosomal membrane to increase the release
  of antigens into the cytoplasm of DCs in DLNs, facilitating the MHC I cross-presentation
  pathway. Meanwhile, the laser-induced rupture of endolysosomes initiates autophagy,
  through which the MHC II molecules are loaded in the autophagosomes. The SV pretreatment
  inhibits the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, further activating autophagy and augmenting
  the MHC II expression for DC maturation.
