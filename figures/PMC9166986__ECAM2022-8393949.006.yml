caption: 'Effect of TSC on the expression of cyclin D1 protein and mRNA in FLS of
  AA rats. (a) The change in cyclin D1 protein expression was observed by immunofluorescence
  analysis (×200): (A) normal group, (B) model group, (C) TSC group, (D) TSC + lncRNA
  OIP5-AS1 siRNA group, (E) lncRNA OIP5-AS1 siRNA group, and (F) lncRNA OIP5-AS1 siRNA + NC
  group. (b) The change in cyclin D1 mRNA expression was observed by RT-qPCR. (c)
  The change in cyclin D1 protein expression was observed by Western blotting. (d):
  Semiquantitative analysis of cyclin D1 protein expression. ##P < 0.01 compared with
  the normal group; ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 compared with the model group.'
