figure_title: mRNA expression of tuft cell-like small cell lung cancer (SCLC), pulmonary
  large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC), and squamous cell carcinoma (SQCC)
  ([, ], TCGA Nature 2012)
caption: A Unsupervised mRNA expression clustering with the combined SCLC and LCNEC
  cohort. B Significantly expressed genes in both tuft cell-like SCLC and LCNEC, compared
  with the respective non-tuft cell-like counterparts (>2 folds, P < 0.05). POU2F3,
  GFI1B, TRPM5, SOX9, ASCL2, AVIL, representative tuft cell genes; FOXI1, the master
  regulator of ionocytes; BCL2, KIT, and MYC, well-known oncogenes; KRT5, a marker
  of squamous differentiation, were included among the 92 genes. C FOXI1 mRNA expression
  in tuft cell-like SCLC and LCNEC. The numbers of the y-axis indicate mRNA expression
  Z score in SCLC and FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon per million reads mapped)
  in LCNEC. D The pathways and gene ontology (GO) analyses for upregulated genes in
  tuft cell-like SCLC and LCNEC. Genes related to the Notch signaling pathway were
  most significantly enriched.
article_title: Pulmonary cancers across different histotypes share hybrid tuft cell/ionocyte-like
  molecular features and potentially druggable vulnerabilities.
