caption: HSP90AA1 over-expression activates STAT1 and P65 in PK-15 and 3D4/2 cells.
  (A) HSP90AA1 over-expression affected the phosphorylation of STAT1 and nuclear translocation
  of p-STAT1 in PK-15 and 3D4/2 cells were observed by laser confocal microscopy.
  (B) HSP90AA1 over-expression affected the nuclear translocation of p-P65 in PK-15
  and 3D4/2 cells were observed by laser confocal microscopy.
article_title: HSP90AA1 interacts with CSFV NS5A protein and regulates CSFV replication
  via the JAK/STAT and NF-κB signaling pathway.
