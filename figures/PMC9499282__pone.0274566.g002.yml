figure_title: 'Outline of a first order binocular energy model (orange pathway): Odd
  and even symmetric monocular receptive fields (white areas represent excitatory
  regions of the receptive fields and dark areas inhibitory regions) are combined
  to compute the first order binocular energy response'
caption: 'Responses are summed across the two eyes for corresponding filters, then
  squared. The squared outputs are summed across the two halves of the quadrature
  pair. Outline of a second order binocular energy model (green and blue pathway):
  Odd and even monocular energy responses are calculated separately for each eye (green
  pathway). The first-order responses are squared and summed, to produce monocular
  energy responses for each eye. This forms the input to the second order filters
  (blue pathway) where the pairs of monocular filters are summed, squared and combined
  to calculate the second-order binocular energy response.'
