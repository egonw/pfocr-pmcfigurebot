caption: Effect of esculetin on A253 cells. (A) Effect of various doses of esculetin
  on A253 cell viability. (B) Fluorescence images of TUNEL staining showing the role
  of esculetin on A253 cell apoptosis (original magnification x100; inset x400). (C)
  Diagrams showing the apoptotic rate of A253 cells. Data are presented as the mean
  Â± standard deviation (n=3; *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs. untreated control
  group).
