caption: 'Oral LPS challenge impacts on the intestinal epithelium apoptosis, sIgA
  concentrations, TJ proteins and inflammation responses as well as intestinal permeability
  in goslings. (A) TUNEL assay of ileum mucosa with the positive cells showing up
  as green, scale bar = 50 μm. (B) The apoptotic index. (C) The sIgA levels in ileum
  mucosa. (D) The mRNA expressions of tight junction (TJ) proteins in ileum mucosa.
  (E) The mRNA expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines and the TLRs/NFκB inflammatory
  signaling pathway in cecal tonsil among groups. (F) The comparisons of the activity
  of D-lactic acid. (G) The liver (GPT and GOT) and kidney (UN and Cr) functions of
  goslings with oral LPS challenge. n = 12 goslings. Abbreviations: CLDN5, claudin-5;
  Cr, creatinine; GOT, glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase; GPT, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase;
  IL1β, interleukin-1β; IL8, interleukin-8; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MyD88, myeloid
  differentiation primary response gene 88; NFκB, nuclear factor-κB; OCLN, occludin;
  TLR4, Toll-like receptor 4; UN, urea nitrogen; ZO1, zona occludens-1.'
