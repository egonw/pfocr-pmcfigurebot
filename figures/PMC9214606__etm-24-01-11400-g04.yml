caption: 'GRWD1 knockdown inactivates the Notch signaling pathway. (A) The mRNA and
  (B) protein expression of Notch1 and Notch4 in breast cancer cells and normal human
  breast epithelial cells was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and
  western blotting, respectively. ***P<0.001 vs. MCF-10A group. (C) The expression
  of Notch1 and Notch4 in MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 cells transfected with siRNA-GRWD1
  was detected by western blot analysis. (D) The expression of Hes1, Hes5, Hey1 and
  Hey2 in MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 cells transfected with siRNA-GRWD1 was detected by
  western blot analysis. (E) The expression of p21, c-Myc, CCND1, HER2 and NF-ÎºB in
  MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 cells transfected with siRNA-GRWD1 was detected by western
  blotting. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs. Control group. #P<0.05, ##P<0.01
  and ###P<0.001 vs. siRNA-NC group. GRWD1, glutamate-rich WD-repeat-containing protein
  1; siRNA, small interfering RNA; NC, negative control.'
