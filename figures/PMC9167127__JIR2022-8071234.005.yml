caption: IL-22 inhibited the G2/M cell cycle arrest in NSCLC cells after cisplatin
  treatment. PC-9 (a) and A549 (b) were incubated with cisplatin (10 μmol/L) and IL-22
  (0, 5, 10, 50, and 100 ng/mL) for 48 hours. Both cell lines were collected, and
  the cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry. The percentage of cells
  in each cell cycle stage was presented as the mean value of triplicate experiments.
