caption: 'Effect of ZGZT Capsule on BMD, femur morphology and fat vacuole in rats
  with osteoporosis. (A) Average BMD of rats in each group; (B) CT results, the femurs
  of rats in the PMOP group were significantly deformed; (C) HE staining results showed
  that fat vacuoles were significantly increased in the PMOP group. *P<0.05 compared
  with the control group; #P<0.05 compared with the PMOP group. BMD, bone mineral
  density; CT, computed tomography; HE, hematoxylin and eosin; PMOP, postmenopausal
  osteoporosis; ZGZT, Zhuanggu Zhitong; E2, estrogen; DXA, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry.'
