caption: 'SZN-1326-p predominately impacted the epithelium by promoting expression
  of Wnt target and cell cycle genes with a concomitant reduction in inflammatory
  pathway expression. (A) The number of significantly enriched intestinal epithelial
  organoid Wnt target genes in the indicated colon tissue layers or lineages. (B)
  Heatmap of canonical cell cycle gene expression in the epithelium displaying average
  Z scores for the genes. (C) Gene expression dot plot of canonical cell cycle genes
  in the epithelium across the 6 different experimental conditions. (D) RT-qPCR of
  bulk colon samples in the DSS model at the day 5 time point except Gpx2, which is
  from day 6. Unpaired, 2-tailed t tests were applied with the Holm multiple comparisons
  correction: ∗P < .05, ∗∗P < .01, ∗∗∗P = .001. (F) Selected top pathways reduced
  (derived from GSEA) in the epithelium after SZN-1326-p treatment relative to the
  anti-GFP treatment in the DSS model at 48 hours (day 6). (G) Expression of S100A9
  and CD45 at day 10 (6 days after treatment); 2 example images each from the indicated
  treatment condition. Scale bar = 200 μm.'
