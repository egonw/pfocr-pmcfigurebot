caption: 'Suppression of CLAACC neuronal activity reduces allodynia(A) Top left: viral
  targeting strategy to express hM4D-mCitrine in CLAACC neurons. Top right: injection
  site of Cre-mCherry (magenta)- and hM4D-mCitrine-expressing axons (green) in the
  ACC. Bottom: retrograde expression of Cre-mCherry- and Cre-dependent expression
  of hM4D-mCitrine in the claustrum.(B) Top: whole-cell current clamp recordings of
  hM4D-mCitrine-expressing CLAACC neurons and example trace showing action potential
  firing in response to a 0.5 nA square current injection at baseline and after 10 μM
  CNO bath application. Bottom: input-output curve showing mean action potential firing
  rate as a function of injected current in CLAACC neurons before and after 10 μm
  CNO bath application (n = 7 neurons; two-way ANOVA: current injection × hM4d stimulation
  interaction, p < 0.05; Fisher’s least significant difference [LSD], ∗p < 0.05).(C)
  Schematic of von Frey protocol for quantification of CFA-induced mechanical allodynia
  following saline or CNO injections (2 mg/kg, i.p.).(D) Time course of mechanical
  paw withdrawal thresholds (PWTs) following intraplantar CFA injection (30 μL) for
  both ipsilateral and contralateral paws in hM4D-positive mice and hM4D-negative
  controls (N = 8, 9 mice; two-way ANOVA: time point × hM4D expression interaction,
  p < 0.001; Bonferroni test: hM4D positive vs. hM4D negative, ∗∗∗p < 0.001).(E) Average
  PWT symmetry (ratio of ipsi- and contralateral PTWs) for saline- and CNO-administration
  days in hM4D-positive mice and hM4D-negative controls (N = 8, 9 mice; three-way-ANOVA:
  hM4D expression × time × hindpaw inflammation interaction, p < 0.01; Fisher’s LSD:
  hM4D positive vs. hM4D negative, ∗∗∗p < 0.001).(F) Average duration of coping responses
  to the application of hot water on the acutely inflamed hindpaw of hM4D-positive
  mice and hM4D-negative controls. Mice were tested following i.p. saline or CNO administration
  (N = 13, 13 mice; two-way ANOVA: CNO treatment effect, ∗p < 0.05; Fisher’s LSD:
  hM4D-positive saline vs. CNO, ∗∗p < 0.01).(G) Average duration of coping responses
  to the plantar application of acetone, as in (F) (N = 13, 13 mice; two-way ANOVA:
  CNO treatment × hM4D expression interaction, ∗p < 0.05; Fisher’s LSD: hM4D-positive
  saline vs. CNO, ∗p < 0.05).(H) Top: timeline of the place conditioning protocol.
  Bottom: average change in preference score for the CNO-conditioned chamber in hM4D-positive
  mice and hM4D-negative controls. Gray points indicate values for individual mice
  (N = 8, 8 mice; Mann-Whitney U test, p > 0.05). Data are presented as mean ± SEM.'
