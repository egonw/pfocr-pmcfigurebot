caption: Analysis of the correlation between immune-related genes and sialylation-related
  lncRNA signature. (A) Heatmap of the correlation between expression of immune-related
  molecules and sialylation-related lncRNAs. (B) Expression of genes involved in the
  LCK pathway, IgG, cytolytic activity, and the MHC family in different risk groups.
  (C) Analysis of immune-stimulator and immune-inhibitor expression with different
  risk scores. LCK, lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase; IgG, immunoglobulin
  G; and MHC, major histocompatibility complex. ****P< 0.0001; ***P< 0.001; **P< 0.01;
  *P< 0.05.
