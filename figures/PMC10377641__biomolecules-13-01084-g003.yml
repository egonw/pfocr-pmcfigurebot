caption: 'Molecular mechanisms through which leptin impacts cancer biology. Leptin
  and its own receptor (ObR) are expressed in different cancer cells and mainly lead
  to the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway, a potent signaling cascade that controls
  various biological processes (i.e., cell proliferation, migration and invasion).
  Leptin/Leptin Receptor can crosstalk with: (i) Notch by inducing the cleavage of
  the intracellular domain of the receptor that regulates the transcription of several
  genes mainly involved in stemness; (ii) Estrogen receptor (ER) alpha sustaining
  its activation and signaling, (iii) Interleukin (IL)-6 that binds its receptor (IL-6R)
  and potentiates the STAT signaling and (iv) several growth factor receptors (GFRs)
  such as VEGF, IGF and EGF Receptors. Mostly, the interaction with these multiple
  oncogenic signaling also contributes to the activation of various signal transduction
  pathways, such as PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK, and further supports STAT3 activation,
  fundamentals to sustain tumor growth and progression. NECD: Notch extracellular
  domain; NICD: Notch Intracellular domain; TFs: Transcriptional Factors; GFs (Growth
  Factors).'
