caption: (a) Interferon alpha/beta signaling pathway genes that are significantly
  down- or up-regulated regulated in symptomatic SARS-COV-2 adults with high viral
  load compared to the low viral load group. On the x-axis is displayed the q-value
  for the up- or down-regulated genes with q-values < 0.05. On the y-axis is displayed
  the log2 fold change for those genes. The size of the dots represents “base mean”
  which is the mean of normalized counts of all samples. b) Similar to (a), a plot
  showing the genes involved in Immunoregulatory interactions between a Lymphoid and
  a non-Lymphoid cell that are up-regulated in the high viral load group.
article_title: Mucosal gene expression in response to SARS-CoV-2 is associated with
  early viral load.
