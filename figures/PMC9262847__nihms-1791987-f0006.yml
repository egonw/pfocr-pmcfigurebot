caption: IL-2 signaling inhibits ATG-mediated humoral response. Using the NP-OVA +
  CFA immunization with either IgG or ATG treatment as shown in , we determined (A)
  the frequency of Tfh (CD4+CXCR5+PD-1+), Th1 (CD4+CXCR5-PD-1-FOXP3-Tbet+), Th2 (CD4+CXCR5-PD-1-FOXP3-Tbet-Gata3+),
  Th17 (CD4+CXCR5-PD-1-FOXP3-Tbet-RORyT+), and Treg (CD4+CXCR5- PD-1-FOXP3+ Tbet-)
  cells at day 8 after NP-OVA + CFA immunization in lymph nodes, (B) serum IL-21 levels
  after 48 hours of immunization with NP-OVA+CFA, and the (C) serum IL-2 levels after
  6 hours of immunization with NP-OVA + CFA with IgG or ATG treatment. (D) Cartoon
  of the IL-2 signaling pathway in CD4+ T cell differentiation. (E) C57Bl/6 mice were
  subcutaneously immunized with NP-OVA+CFA and treated with 500 μg of murine ATG or
  IgG control. A subgroup then received ATG and 30,000 U of recombinant mouse IL-2,
  intraperitoneally, twice a day. Mice were euthanized at day 8 after immunization,
  and serum and lymph nodes were analyzed, as shown in . Quantification of the geometric
  mean fluorescence intensity (gMFI) of (F) pSTAT3, (G) Bcl6, (H) pSTAT5, and (I)
  Blimp-1 in CD4+ T cells from draining lymph nodes. Red histograms and red dots represent
  the ATG-treated mice, black histogram and dots represent the IgG-treated mice, and
  the purple histograms and dots represent the ATG-treated mice that received IL-2.
  The frequency and absolute cell number of (J) Tfh cells, (K) total B cells, (L)
  GC B cells, and (M) IgG1+ B cells in the draining lymph node. (N) ELISA quantification
  of serum NP-specific IgG antibodies at day 8 after immunization. Naïve mice were
  used as additional controls. Data as mean ± SD are shown (n = 4 per group; One-way
  ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparisons test).
