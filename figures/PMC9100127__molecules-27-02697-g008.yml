caption: DHCE destroys cytoskeletal organization and attenuates the Ras/Raf/ERK/MMP9
  pathway in gastric cancer cells. (A) The expression of F-actin microfilament was
  measured by Actin-Tracker Red-555 staining. The relative expression of F-actin microfilament
  was quantified by red fluorescence area. (B) Immunoblot analyses of MMP9, Ras, p-c-Raf,
  and p-ERK/ERK in MGC803 and SGC7901 cells treated with or without DHCE. The experiment
  was performed in triplicate, and the statistical results are expressed as the means
  ± SD (* p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 compared with the control group).
