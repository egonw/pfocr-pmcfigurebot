caption: Metabolism of branched-chain amino acid influence the progression and prognosis
  of kidney cancer. (a) Kaplan-Meier survival curves show the difference of overall
  survival between patients at high- or low- activity of BCAA level in KIRC and KIRP.
  P-value indicates significance levels from the comparison of survival curves using
  the log-rank test. Survival analysis show high BCAA level was significantly associated
  with poor prognosis in kidney cancer. (b) The comparison of relative expression
  of BCAA metabolic genes among normal tissues, and tumours with or without CNV loss
  of indicated gene. (c) Correlation between gene expression of PPARA and BCAA level.
  The Pearson correlation coefficient is show in the upper part of plot. (d) Transcription
  factor motif enrichment analysis of BCAA metabolic genes. The y-axis shows transcription
  factors, and the x-axis represents rich factors for each transcription factor. The
  size of the points indicates the number of BCAA metabolic genes enriched in the
  target genes of the corresponding transcription factor. The colour of points shows
  the significance of each transcription factor using the logarithm of â€“log10(adjusted
  p-value) with smaller p-value (red) representing more significant enrichment. (e)
  Differential expression analysis between wild-type mice and PPARA knock-out mice.
  The y-axis shows the significance of each BCAA metabolic gene, and the x-axis represents
  fold change of each BCAA metabolic gene in differential expression analysis. Genes
  that are significantly up-regulated in PPARA knock-out mice are plot as red dots,
  while down-regulated genes are plot as blue dots. (f) Gene set enrichment analysis
  of differential expression genes between wild-type mice and PPARA knock-out mice.
