caption: A diagram of the three most common cytokine pathways concerning cognitive
  dysfunction in psychiatric disorders. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway and the
  Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signalling pathway have been identified as promising therapeutic
  targets for psychiatric disorder therapy. Amongst them, the mTOR can promote the
  synthesis of synaptic proteins, and PI3K stimulation can enhance NMDA‐dependent
  LTD and stimulate the exocytosis of AMPA receptors, contributing to the enhancement
  of excitatory synaptic transmission. AMPA, alpha‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazole‐propionic
  acid; Akt, protein kinase B; ERK, extracellular signal‐regulated kinase; FADD, Fas‐associated
  death domain protein; GF, growth factor; GSK, glycogen synthase kinase; IKK, IκB
  kinase; JAK, Janus kinase; LTD, long‐term depression; LTP, long‐term potentiation;
  mTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin; NMDA, N‐methyl‐d‐aspartate; NF‐κB, nuclear
  factor kappa‐light‐chain‐enhancer of activated B cells; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol‐4,5‐bisphosphate
  3‐kinase; SOCs, suppressor of cytokines; STAT, signal transducers and activators
  of transcription; TARDD, TNF‐receptor 1‐associated death domain protein; TRAF2,
  TNF receptor‐associated factor 2
