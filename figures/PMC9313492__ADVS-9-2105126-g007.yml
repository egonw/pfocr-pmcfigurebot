caption: 'In vivo CRISPR/Cas9 screens identify metabolic genes that determine HCC
  cell tumorigenicity. a) Venn diagram showing the overlapping differentially expressed
  metabolism‐related genes between 12 paired HCC patients and 50 paired TCGA‐LIHC
  patients. b) A schematic diagram of the in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 screening. c) The genes
  were ranked on the basis of their corresponding RIGER p value for the metabolism‐related
  genes from the CRISPR/Cas9 screens. Analysis was performed using the RIGER algorithm.
  d) Enrichment of KEGG pathways. The horizontal axis shows the fold enrichment score
  in each signaling pathway. The color of the points in the figure represents the
  significance of the enrichment, and the size of the points represents the count
  of the genes enriched in each signaling pathway. e) Venn diagram showing the number
  of genes between the oncogenic metabolic genes identified from the CRISPR/Cas9 screens
  and the genes with upregulated expression, which were significantly associated with
  poor survival and an embryonic stem cell‐like gene expression signature in the TCGA‐LIHC
  cohort. Metabolic_genes: 35 of 67 metabolism‐related genes were metabolic enzyme
  genes, which directly participate in metabolic pathways. Upregulation: 37 of 67
  metabolism‐related genes were upregulated in HCC. LIHC_survival: 24 of 67 metabolism‐related
  genes were associated with worse overall survival (OS) in HCC patients from TCGA‐LIHC.
  ES_signature: 27 of 67 metabolism‐related genes were highly associated with embryonic
  stem cell‐like gene expression signature. f) GSEA analysis of the previously defined
  ESC‐like module and metabolic gene expression in the TCGA‐LIHC cohort. The upper
  diagram shows the gene enrichment score as a dotted line. The horizontal axis shows
  each gene in this gene set, and the vertical axis shows the corresponding correlation
  coefficient with the indicated gene in patients from the TCGA‐LIHC cohort. Association
  between the enrichment of ES cell‐like gene expression signature and the expression
  of four metabolic genes in HCC tumor samples were shown by GSEA analysis. The mRNA
  level of the indicated metabolic gene was correlated significantly with that of
  the ES cell‐like gene. g) Upregulation patterns of four genes across different cancer
  types (y axis) compared with those of paired normal samples (FC > 1.5; t‐test corrected
  p < 0.05). The color intensity indicates the fold change, and the point size indicates
  the significance of the p value. Upper bars show the frequency of cancer types,
  with upregulation for each metabolic gene. h) Association of the expression of four
  genes with patient overall survival times based on univariate Cox proportional hazards
  models in different cancer types. Size denotes statistical significance at a given
  FDR. Color denotes the hazard ratio. Dots with black edges denote significant difference
  (Cox p < 0.05). i) HK2 expression between HCC patients and normal tissues from the
  TCGA LIHC dataset in the GEPIA database (top). Kaplan‐Meier curves show overall
  survival in the TCGA LIHC dataset in the GEPIA database (lower).'
