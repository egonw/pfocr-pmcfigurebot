caption: Panther Gene Ontology (GO) analyses of proteomics data based on biological
  processes and molecular functions. Reliable protein IDs (n = 582) were processed
  for Panther GO analysis. Subcategories were created and are shown using different
  colors. Associated molecular functions have also been indicated accordingly. The
  majority of the identified proteins exhibited a known function related to metabolic
  process, oxidoreductase activity, and antibiotic catabolic process. Other proteins
  identified were also highly related to sperm maturation processes, such as sperm
  oocyte recognition, sperm-oocyte binding, chromatin assembly, plasma membrane organization,
  and lipid modification. Another group of proteins were found to have function in
  regulating Golgi vesicle transport, which might be responsible for the ER-mediated
  cellular secretory pathway of epididymal QSOX1.
