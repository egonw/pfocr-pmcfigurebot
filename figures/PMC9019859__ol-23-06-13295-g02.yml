caption: Overexpression of KLF10 inhibits the invasion and migration of melanoma cells.
  (A) Wound-healing and (B) Transwell assays were used to detect the levels of migration
  and invasion of melanoma cells. Scale bar, 100 Âµm. (C) Expression levels of metastasis-related
  proteins (MMP2 and MMP9) were detected by western blotting. ***P<0.001 vs. Ov-NC.
  KLF10, Kruppel-like factor 10; NC, negative control; Ov, overexpression.
article_title: KLF10 upregulates ACSM3 via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway to inhibit
  the malignant progression of melanoma.
