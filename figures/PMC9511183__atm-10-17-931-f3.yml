caption: Features of the significant m6A module. (A,B) Hierarchical clustering was
  conducted to construct a dendrogram of genes. (C,D) The link between the MEs and
  modification patterns (mediated by m6A). (E) The GO terms BP, CC, and MF, were used
  to functionally annotate the genes in the vital m6A module. (F) The KEGG pathway
  terms were used to annotate the genes in the significant m6A module. GEO, Gene Expression
  Omnibus; BP, biological process; CC, cellular component; MF, molecular function;
  m6A, N6-methyladenosine; MEs, module eigengenes; GO, Gene Ontology; KEGG, Kyoto
