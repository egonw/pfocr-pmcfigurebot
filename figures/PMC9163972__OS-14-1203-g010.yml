caption: Bnd reduced bone turnover in OVX mice. (A‐B) The expression of ALP, which
  was significantly higher after OVX on day 75 than in the sham group, was lower in
  the OVX + E2 and OVX + Bnd groups than in the OVX group. (C–E) Runx2 and OCN levels
  were detected using immunofluorescence and were found to be increased in the OVX
  group and decreased in the E2 and Bnd groups. (F‐I) Runx2 and OCN levels were detected
  using immunohistochemistry and were found to be increased in the OVX group. However,
  the increases were attenuated by E2 and Bnd. The results indicated that E2 and Bnd
  significantly reduced bone turnover in OVX mice. All differences were tested using
  one‐way ANOVA and Tukey's test; ns, not significant; *P < 0.01. **P < 0.001.
