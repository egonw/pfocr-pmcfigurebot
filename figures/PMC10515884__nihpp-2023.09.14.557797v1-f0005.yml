caption: (A.) Schematic representing the initial events of the metastatic cascade
  that can be measured using the CRC-OOC. Tumor cells in the top channel (1) can be
  visualized and analyzed separately from tumor cells that have invaded and adhered
  in the endothelial compartment (2). Additionally, tumor cells that are found in
  the endothelial effluent (3; circulating tumor cells (“CTC-like” cells)) can also
  be collected and analyzed. (B.) Circulating tumor cells were collected from the
  endothelial effluent of stretched and not stretched HCT116 CRC-Chips and RNAseq
  was performed. GO Pathway analysis was performed on a subset of genes with either
  a 2-fold difference between stretched and not stretched CTCs or an FDR-adjusted
  p-value <0.1. N=2 biological replicates with 3 pooled chips in each replicate. (C.)
  Gene expression of neurotransmitter-related genes were measured by a neurotransmitter-specific
  PCR array. HCT116 tumor cells of stretched and not stretched chips were harvested
  on day 6 from the top epithelial channel and isolated via FACs. Data is displayed
  as the gene expression fold change of stretch versus not stretch conditions Expression
  was normalized to the average of 5 housekeeping genes. Genes that had a 1.5-fold
  increase or decrease in the stretched condition are displayed. N=3 biological replicates
  with 3 chips pooled per biological replicate. (D.) Schematic of the production of
  GABA from glutamate by the enzyme GAD1. In this figure, experiments related to GABA
  are indicated in purple and experiments related to GAD1 are indicated in light blue.
  (E.) Representative confocal immunofluorescent images of the epithelial (top; 1)
  or endothelial (bottom; 2) channel of the CRC-Chips stained for GABA (purple) on
  day 6. Invaded HCT116 H2B-GFP stain positive for GABA, while HCT116 H2B-GFP tumor
  cells that are in the top channel stain weakly for GABA. DAPI stains the nuclei
  of Caco2 C2BBe1 cells in the top channel and endothelial cells in the bottom channel.
  Scale bars represent 200 μm in the top channel image and 100 μm in the bottom channel
  images. Top channel images are maximum projections that span a 35 μm Z-height with
  a 5 μm step size. Bottom channel images are maximum projections that span a 10 μm
  Z-height with a 5 μm step size. (F.) RNAseq analysis was performed on CRC organoids
  and normalized GAD1 expression is shown. N=5 independent donors with 2–3 replicates
  each. Individual data points are shown and mean ± SEM is displayed. Analysis between
  US and UP data was performed using an unpaired t-test; ***p<0.001 (G.) CRC organoids
  were isolated from stretched chips and qPCR analysis of GAD1 gene expression was
  performed. N=5 independent doners with 3 replicates each. Individual data points
  are shown and mean ± SEM is displayed. Analysis between US and UP data was performed
  using an unpaired t-test p<0.05. (H.) GAD1 mRNA expression from TCGA in KRAS, NRAS,
  or BRAF mutant primary colon cancer tumors. N=196 patients with KRAS, NRAS, or BRAF
  mutant tumors; N=201 patients with KRAS, NRAS, or BRAF wildtype tumors. Individual
  data points are shown and median with interquartile range is represented. Data was
  analyzed with an unpaired t-test; ****p<0.0001. (I.) Kaplan-Meier curve with univariate
  analysis of the survival of patients with KRAS, NRAS, or BRAF mutated CRC tumors
  based on high versus low expression of GAD1 (defined as above or below the median
  GAD1 mRNA expression z-score of 0.3). Data was extracted from the TCGA. N=254 patients.
  Data was analyzed using a log-rank (Mantel-Cox test). (J.) Effluent from the epithelial
  channel of the patient-derived organoids was collected on day 0 (D0) and day 6 (D6).
  GABA intensity was analyzed from extracted metabolites N=6 chips per timepoint per
  patient; n=4 on D0 and 2 on D6 for UK. Data was analyzed using a two-way ANOVA;
  ***p<0.001; ****p<0.0001. (K.) US-H2B-GFP (top) and UP-H2B-GFP (bottom) stretched
  tumor-chips were stained for GABA (purple). Scale bars represent 200 μm. L. Representative
  10x immunofluorescence images of the 5 tumors stained for EpCAM (green), CK20 (red),
  and GABA (purple). Scale bars represent 500 μm and 200 μm for UK. All schematics
  were made in or are from BioRender.
