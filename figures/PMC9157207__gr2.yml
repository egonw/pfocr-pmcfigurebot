caption: 'HRP2 induces structural damage and apoptosis in iPSC-derived cortical organoids(A)
  Representative z stack projections of paraffin-embedded cortical organoids sections
  show the expression of neuronal stem cells (Sox-2), mature neurons (TUJ1), and mesoderm-derived
  microglia (IBA-1 and very few Brachyury) at 50 days in culture, as well as astrocytes
  (GFAP) at 100 days in culture. After cortical organoids were treated with HRP2 for
  8 h, NRG1 was added for 18 h, (B) HRP2 induced disorganization of cortical structures.
  (C, J) Representative images and quantification of cleaved caspase three expression
  showed that it increased throughout the organoid structure when HRP2 was added,
  whereas NRG1 decreased this effect. (D,E) Western blot densitometry of cell lysates
  treated with HRP2 and NRG1 confirms that HRP2 induces cell death through a caspase
  3/caspase 8/PARP-mediated pathway (F-H) and that NFkB expression increased (I).
  Data are represented as mean ± SEM ImageJ software was used to quantify protein
  expression (IHC and WB) from at least 3 organoids in 3 experiments. (a: p < 0.05
  compared to basal conditions; b: p < 0.05 compared to HRP2 treatment; One-way ANOVA
  or t-test were used). Scale bar: 20 μm.'
