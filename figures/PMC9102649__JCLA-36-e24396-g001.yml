caption: CDCA5 is an oncogene involved in the development and progression of LUAD.
  A, CDCA5 is overexpressed in 18 common malignant tumors. B, The expression of CDCA5
  in tumor tissues of patients with LUAD is significantly higher than in adjacent
  tissues. C, LUAD with high expression of CDCA5 has a relatively poor prognosis.
  D–F, Advanced clinicopathological characteristics, including Stage (D), T (E), N
  (F), of patients with LUAD are closely associated with high expression of CDCA5
