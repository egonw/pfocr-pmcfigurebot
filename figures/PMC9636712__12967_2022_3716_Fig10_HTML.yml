caption: 'Schematic illustration of the relationship between ROS levels and ACE2 during
  chemotherapy in breast cancer cells. Left panel: In sensitive breast cancer cells
  with low ROS levels, ACE2 expression is relatively low; when the cells are stimulated
  by chemotherapeutic agents, ROS production is induced and phosphorylation of AKT
  is promoted, which in turn upregulates ACE2 expression by enhancing the expression
  of HIF-1α. Right panel: ACE2 is expressed at high levels in drug-resistant cells
  and maintains ROS homeostasis by inhibiting the overproduction of ROS. In drug-resistant
  cells with knockdown of ACE2, anticancer drugs induced a large increase in ROS levels,
  which induced apoptosis'

  signaling pathway: a potential prognostic marker for breast cancer patients receiving
  chemotherapy.'
