caption: 'RTs activate RAS‐RAF‐MEK‐ERK (MAPK/ERK) signaling (A) Simplified schematic
  of the MAPK/ERK phosphorylation signal transduction cascade. (B) Volcano plot displaying
  the transcriptome highlighting differential expressed genes in color (FDR < 0.01,
  fold change > 1.5). MAPK Pathway Activity Score genes [] are indicated. PT n = 4,
  RT n = 4. (C) Immunofluorescence staining for phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) (red),
  GFP (green), and DAPI (blue) of tissue deriving from a normal Krt14‐Cre mT/mG mammary
  gland, a PT, and an RT. Scale bar is set at 10 μm. Images of a biological replicate
  are shown in Fig S5. (D) The percentage of cells expressing pERK1/2 in PTs and RTs.
  Quantification of each 4 images of 2 biological controls of PTs and RTs is shown.
  Data are represented as mean ± SEM (unpaired t test, *P < 0.05). (E) The intensity
  of pERK1/2 staining in pERK1/2‐positive cells. Quantification of each 4 images of
  2 biological controls of PTs and RTs are shown. Data are represented as mean ± SEM.
  (unpaired t test, *P < 0.05) (F) The cumulative intensity of pERK1/2 staining in
  the tumors. Quantification of each 4 images of 2 biological controls of PTs and
  RTs are shown. Data are represented as mean ± SEM. (unpaired t test, n.s.) (G) Model:
  constitutive active KrasG12D results in strong MAPK/ERK signaling in a subset of
  the PT cells. RT cells do not reach as strong of a phosphorylation cascade per cell
  as in some PT cells. However, since a large percentage of individual RT cells activate
  MAPK/ERK signaling, the result for both tumor types as a whole is similar MAPK/ERK
  signaling.'
