caption: 'rhALR attenuates renal damage after I/R injury induction. (a, b) After 60 min
  of bilateral renal ischemia, blood samples were collected at 24, 48, and 72 h, followed
  by renal reperfusion, and serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were measured.
  The increase of two indexes in the rhALR1 and rhALR2 groups was withdrawn (P < 0.05).
  Urea nitrogen and serum creatinine in the I/R+rhALR2 group were lower than those
  in the I/R+rhALR1 group (P < 0.05). (c) HE staining of 24 h renal slices in the
  I/R group showed severe renal tubule necrosis. Renal morphology was preserved after
  rhALR1 and rhALR2 treatment (magnification, ×200). Histological changes were assessed
  semiquantitatively for tubular necrosis. The tubular damage score was given by two
  uninformed observers. Data were expressed as the mean ± SD. ∗P < 0.05 as compared
  to the sham group, and #P < 0.05 as compared to the I/R+saline group.'
