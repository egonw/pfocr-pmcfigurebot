caption: 'The distinct capacity of MSeA, selenite, and SeM in blocking fatty acyl
  synthesis from glucose or Gln in A549 and H1299 cells. A549 or H1299 cells were
  treated with 5 µM MSeA, 6.25 µM selenite, or 500 µM SeM for 24 h with 13C6-Glc (n
  = 3) (A) or 13C5,15N2-Gln (n = 2) (B) as tracer, as described in Methods. Polar
  metabolites (A(b–e),B(b–e)) of cells were analyzed by GC-MS while lipids (A(f,g),B(f,g))
  were measured by FT-MS. Lipid synthesis from 13C6-Glc and 13C5,15N2-Gln was traced
  in (A(a)) and (B(a)), respectively. ●, ● in (A(a)) 12C, 13C from glycolysis + Krebs
  cycle ●, ●, ●/●/● via PDH and PC, ◆ in (B(a)) 12C, 13C from glutaminolysis + Krebs
  cycle, 13C from glutaminolysis + Krebs cycle + ME + PC, 15N, respectively. ❚: 13C

  with x the number of 13C atoms. GlyOH3P: glycerol-3-phosphate; PCh: phosphatidylcholines;
