figure_title: MEX3A expression is high in NPC, especially in the advanced stage
caption: A MEX3A mRNA levels were obtained from GEO datasets (GSE53819, containing
  18 normal nasopharyngeal tissues and 18 NPC tissues; GSE12452, containing 10 normal
  nasopharyngeal tissues and 31 NPC tissues). MEX3A mRNA levels were compared between
  the two groups using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. B Compared with normal nasopharyngeal
  tissues, MEX3A levels were higher in NPC tissues, especially in the advanced stage
  group. C Kaplan–Meier curves of overall survival of NPC patients with high or low
  MEX3A expression (n = 105). D MEX3A mRNA levels in various NPC cell lines were detected
  by RT-qPCR. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.

  axis by regulating NF-κB signaling pathway.
