caption: 'GC samples were clustered by NF-κB signaling pathway score. (a) The expression
  of NF-κB-related genes in GC samples. (b) GC samples were divided into two cluster
  (C1 and C2 type) based on NF-κB signaling pathway score (setting median value as
  cutoff). The bar charts showed the proportions of different grade, T, pathology,
  and stage in C1 and C2 type. (c) Volcano plot showed the DEGs between C1 and C2
  type. The labeled items were immune checkpoint-related genes. (d) Volcano plot showed
  differential biological processes analyzed by GSVA between C1 and C2 type. (e) GSEA
  showed that multiple immune-related biological processes were enriched in C2 type.
  GC: gastric cancer; DEGs: differential expressed genes; GSVA: gene set variation
  analysis; GSEA: gene set enrichment analysis.'
