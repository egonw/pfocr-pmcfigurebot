caption: Patients who were annotated bypass signaling activation by cfDNA‐NGS monitoring
  showed resistance to ALK‐TKI. (A, B) The treatment summary is displayed on the upper
  panel. The images of whole‐body bone scan and enhance computerized tomography (CT)
  during treatment are displayed on the middle panel. A diagram of the signaling pathway
  demonstrates the principal changes between pretreatment and at progression in cfDNA‐NGS
  and the resistance mechanisms of ALK acquired resistance mutation and bypass signaling
  activation. The size of the circle represents allele frequency (%) of fusion, indel
  or mutation, or copy number
article_title: Longitudinal monitoring by next‐generation sequencing of plasma cell‐free
  DNA in ALK rearranged NSCLC patients treated with ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
