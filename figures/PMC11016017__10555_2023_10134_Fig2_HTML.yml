caption: 'Graphical representation of major NF-κB action pathways in cancer cells
  arising in the TME. The canonical pathway is triggered by numerous signals, e.g.,
  proinflammatory cytokines, xenobiotics, or viral and bacterial infections. After
  activation of the corresponding receptors, the IKK complexes (α and β) are activated,
  then IKK-mediated IκBα-phosphorylation and subsequent degradation are initiated,
  leading to rapid and transient nuclear translocation of the prototypical NF-κB heterodimer
  p56/p50. The non-canonical NF-κB pathway is activated by various ligands such as
  RANKL, BAFF, and CD40L. In response to NIK, IKKα is phosphorylated, which then converts
  p100 to mature p52. The p52 then migrates to the nucleus via its dimerization with
  RelB to activate non-canonical NF-κB target genes. NF-κB regulates processes associated
  with all stages of carcinogenesis including modulation of cell plasticity, i.e.,
  inflammation, cellular transformation, apoptosis, survival, proliferation, angiogenesis,
  invasion, metastasis, and drug chemoresistance. Abbreviations: P26S, 26S proteasome;
  IκBα, an inhibitor of kappa B α; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition; NIK, NF-κB-inducing
  kinase; RANKL, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand; BAFF, B-cell activating factor;
  CD40L, CD40 ligand'
