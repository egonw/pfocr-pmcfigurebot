caption: (a) Effect of methanol-soluble steam-exploded lignin fraction (SEL-F2) on
  protein kinase A (PKA), phospho-PKA (p-PKA), cAMP-response element-binding protein
  (CREB), and phosphor-CREB (p-CREB) protein expression levels in B16F10 melanoma
  cells. B16F10 melanoma cells were treated with 25, 50, and 100 μg/mL SEL-F2 or arbutin
  prior to α-MSH treatment for 6 h. The loading control was assessed using a β-actin
  antibody; quantitative analysis of (b) p-PKA and (c) p-CREB. Cell lysates were subjected
  to Western blotting using antibodies against p-PKA, PKA, p-CREB, and CREB. ** p
  < 0.01.
