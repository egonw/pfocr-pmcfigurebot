caption: 'Up‐regulation of SERPINA5 is correlated with poor prognosis in GC. Kaplan–Meier
  survival curves showing the effect of SERPINA5 expression on (A) overall survival
  rates and (B) disease‐free survival rate in patients with GC. (C): SERPINA5 expression
  in 17 paired human gastric cancer and adjacent normal tissues. (D): Expression of
  SERPINA5 in normal GES‐1 cells and three gastric cancer cell lines. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001'
