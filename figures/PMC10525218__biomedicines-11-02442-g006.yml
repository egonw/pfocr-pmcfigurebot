caption: 'Regulation of apoptosis and autophagy through activation of JNK in MC-3
  oral cancer cells upon PL treatment. (A) The MC-3 oral cancer cells were pretreated
  with SP600125, a JNK inhibitor (50 μM), for 2 h, followed by treatment with PL (0
  and 8 μM) for 24 h. The cell viability was measure by MTT assay. (B) Protein levels
  of PARP, Bax, Bcl-2, t-JNK, p-JNK, LC3 were measured by Western blotting. β-actin
  was used as loading control. The results are representative of three independent
  experiments (Statistically significant differences, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 vs.
  the control group; #p < 0.05 vs. the PL treatment group).'
