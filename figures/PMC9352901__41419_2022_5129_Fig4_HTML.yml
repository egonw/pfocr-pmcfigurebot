figure_title: CRMP2 derived from CAFs activates HIF-1α-glycolysis signaling pathway
caption: 'A RNA-sequencing analysis of the differential genes based on A2780 cells
  treated with r-CRMP2. KEGG bubble map displayed the top 18 pathways enriched in
  the differential genes (log2 (Fold Change) > 1 and Q-value < 0.05). HIF-1α signaling
  pathway and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway were both statistically significant
  (P < 0.05). Size of bubble represented the gene number while the color represents
  the P-value. B Western blotting validated the HIF-1α-glycolysis pathway using co-culture
  models from one day (1D) to three days (3D). UN1-3: cells untreated with CAF-CM
  were set as the controls of 1–3 day. C Western blotting detected the HIF-1α-glycolysis
  pathway after treatment with different concentrations of r-CRMP2 (ng/ml). D, E Western
  blotting and RT-qPCR analysis of the HIF-1α-glycolysis pathway after knocking down
  CRMP2 in SKOV3 cells and overexpressing CRMP2 in A2780 cells. F, G Seahorse XF Extracellular
  Analysers were used to detect extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen
  consumption rate (OCR) on CRMP2-silenced SKOV3 (SKOV3-KD) and CRMP2-overexpressed
  A2780 (A2780-OE) cells. F Respective images of ECAR measurement in SKOV3-KD and
  A2780-OE cells. Glycolysis and glycolytic capacity were analyzed in SKOV3-KD and
  A2780-OE cells. G Respective images of OCR measurement in SKOV3-KD and A2780-OE
  cells. ATP production and maximal respiration were analyzed using GraphPad software.
  Results are presented as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. UN untreated. NC negative control.'
