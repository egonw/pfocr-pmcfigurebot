caption: 'Schematic illustration representing the role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway in fibrosis. (A) shows the binding of Wnt to the frizzled receptor that
  forms a complex with LRP. (B) shows the ubiquitination of the degeneration complex
  composed of DVL, Axin, APC, GSK3, and CK1. (C) shows the internalization of the
  receptor complex into the endosomal vesicles that causes the sequestration of the
  degeneration complex and suppression of GSK3. (D) GSK3 is then transferred to MVB
  and protects cytoplasmic β-catenin against proteasome degradation. In section (E),
  β-catenin is then carried to the nucleus and interacts with various transcription
  proteins such as LEF/TCF, p300, and CBP. (F) shows the termination of the signaling
  pathway. PKC-6 phosphorylates the β-catenin, making it a target for ubiquitination
  with (TRIM)33. Then, the ubiquitinated β-catenin is degraded in the proteasome complex.
  (G) Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway may also end with 14-3-3ζ and Chibby (Cby).
