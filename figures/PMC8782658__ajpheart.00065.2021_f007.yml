caption: Identification of S-nitrosylated Cys 503 in PKCζ. Protein sequence from human
  PKCζ. Purified PKCζ was S-nitrosylated with GSNO for 30 min, subjected to biotin
  switch assay followed by in-solution trypsin digestion. The kinase domain of PKCζ
  is shown in gray background. Cysteine 503 (red background) was the only S-nitrosylated
  cysteine according to mass spectrometry. GSNO, S-nitrosoglutathione; PKCζ, protein
  kinase Cζ.
