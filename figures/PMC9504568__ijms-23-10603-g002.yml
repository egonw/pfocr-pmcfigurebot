caption: Effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on the inflammatory cytokine expression in PEDV-infected
  IPEC-J2 cells at 1 h post-infection. The sub-confluent cells were incubated with
  1,25(OH)2D3 (20 nM) for 24 h, after which the cells were infected with PEDV (1 MOI).
  After 1 h of absorption, the cells were washed with PBS and then cultured with 1,25(OH)2D3
  (20 nM) for 1 h. Then, the cells were collected for RT-qPCR (A–C) and Western blotting
  analysis (D). * p < 0.05.
