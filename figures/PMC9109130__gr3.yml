caption: Wnt/β-catenin pathway is required for apoEVs migration. (A) Western blotting
  shows the systemically infused apoEVs increased the expression level of active β-catenin
  in the skin. (B) Immunofluorescent images show apoEVs upregulated Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling (green) in the skin of C57BL/6 mice after systemically infusion. The relative
  intensity of activated β-catenin was calculated. n = 3. **P < 0.01, Student's t-test.
  Data shown as mean ± SD. (C) EdU staining shows that systemically infused apoEVs
  accelerated the turnover rate of the skin in K14–H2BGFP mice, especially in the
  basal layer. Dotted lines demarcate dermal-epidermal junction. n = 4. ***P < 0.001,
  Student's t-test. Data shown as mean ± SD. (D) Western blotting analysis shows that
  LiCl treatment upregulated the expression level of active β-catenin in apoEV-treated
  mice. In contrast, XAV939 treatment reduced the level of active β-catenin expression
  in apoEV-treated mice. (E) Immunofluorescent images show the number of GFP-ApoEV
  migrating to the epidermis was increased in LiCl treatment group and reduced in
  XAV939 treatment group at 7 days post-injection. White dotted line represents the
  dividing layer between stratum corneum and the other layers of epidermis. n = 3.
  *P < 0.05, one-way ANOVA test. Data shown as mean ± SD. (F) Western blotting confirmed
  the level of GFP in the skin tissue was increased in LiCl treatment group and reduced
  in XAV939 treatment group. (G) Immunofluorescent images show XAV939 treatment reduced
  the expression level of Wnt/β-catenin and inhibited apoEVs secretion from the skin.
  Panel includes higher magnification of the boxed region to show localization of
  apoEVs. White dotted line represents the dividing layer between stratum corneum
  and the other layers of epidermis. The correlation between apoEVs and active-β-catenin
  was calculated. n = 6. ***P < 0.001, Student's t-test. Data shown as mean ± SD.
  (H) Immunofluorescent images show XAV939 treatment reduced the turnover rate and
  apoEV (red) elimination from the skin. Panel includes higher magnification of the
  boxed region to show the intensity of apoEVs at the epidermis. The correlation between
  apoEVs elimination and turnover rate was calculated. n = 3. **P < 0.01, Student's
  t-test. Data shown as mean ± SD. (I) Western blotting shows that treatment with
  apoEVs, but not synthetic lipid vesicles containing PS, activates Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling in the skin. (J) Immunofluorescent images show the location of PKH26-ApoEV
  and Cy3-PS in the skin. White dotted lines indicated the boundary of epidermis.
  SC, stratum corneum; BM, basement membrane; F, hair follicle; D, dermis; E, epidermis.
