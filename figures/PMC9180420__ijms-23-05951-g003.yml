caption: Measurements of the growth curve and MnODA of various gene-knockout mutant
  strains. (A,C,E,G) Growth curve; (B,D,F,H) MnODA (refers to concentration of Mn
  oxides) of (A,C,E,G). (A,B), pyruvate metabolic pathway; (C,D), glucogenic amino
  acid metabolic pathway; (E,F), glyoxylic acid metabolic pathway; (G,H), lactic acid
  metabolic pathway. The wild-type strain MB266 was used as the control for all measurements.
  Means followed by * in a column were significantly different (n = at least 3; p
  < 0.05).
