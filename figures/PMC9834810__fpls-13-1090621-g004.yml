caption: Comparative transcriptomic analysis of HFTH1 and HF before and after AAAP
  infection. (A) DEGs in HF compared with HFTH1 at the same time before and after
  AAAP infection. (B–D) Compared with HFTH1, HF up-regulated the KEGG pathway with
  significant enrichment of DEGs at 12 HPI (B), 24 HPI, and (C) and 48 HPI (D).
article_title: Insertion of a TRIM-like sequence in MdFLS2-1 promoter is associated
  with its allele-specific expression in response to Alternaria alternata in apple.
