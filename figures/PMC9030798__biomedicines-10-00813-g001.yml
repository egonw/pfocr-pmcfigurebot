caption: 'Canonical signaling and structural domain organization of PI3Kγ. (a) An
  overview of PI3Kγ-mediated AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. The activated mTOR is further
  involved in GC progression through the remodeling of TAM differentiation. The therapeutics
  available for targeting PI3K mediated pathways have been categorized into three
  major classes, as illustrated in the inset box. (b) The overall crystal structure
  of human PI3Kγ (PDB: 6xrm) consists of four domains: an RBD domain in cyan, a C2
  domain in yellow, a helical domain in green, and a kinase domain colored in slate
  (N-lobe) and pink (C-lobe), respectively. The inhibitor V81 bound to the hinge is
  shown in orange.'
