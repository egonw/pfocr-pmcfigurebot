figure_title: A model depicts the role of the IDO1-MDM2-p53 pathway in DLBCL growth
caption: MDM2 and p53 act downstream of IDO1 to regulate tumor cell growth. This illustrates
  that IDO1 inhibition could activate the p53 pathway and induce cell cycle arrest
  and apoptosis by downregulating MDM2 expression in DLBCL cells.
article_title: IDO1 plays a tumor-promoting role via MDM2-mediated suppression of
  the p53 pathway in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
