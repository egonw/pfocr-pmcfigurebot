caption: (A) Mapping of TLR-signaling pathway in burn injury rats. Each gene in the
  KEGG TLR-signaling network (KEGG rno04620) is colored according to its expression
  level in the burn injury group compared with that of the sham group. Genes that
  were significantly upregulated are colored red, and those that were significantly
  downregulated are marked blue; (B) Mapping of IL-17 signaling pathway in burn injury
  rats. Each gene in the KEGG TLR-signaling network (KEGG rno04657) is colored according
  to its expression level in the burn injury group compared with that of the sham
  group. Genes that were significantly upregulated are colored red, and those that
  were significantly downregulated are marked blue; (C) Mapping of RIG-I-Like receptor
  signaling pathway in burn injury rats. Each gene in the KEGG TLR-signaling network
  (KEGG rno04622) is colored according to its expression level in the burn injury
  group compared with that of the sham group. Genes that were significantly upregulated
  are colored red, and those that were significantly downregulated are marked blue;
  (D) Mapping of TNF signaling pathway in burn-injury-induced upregulated DEGs in
  rats. Each gene in the KEGG TNF signaling network (KEGG rno04668) is colored according
  to its expression level in the burn injury group compared with that of the sham
  group. Genes that were significantly upregulated are colored red, and those that
  were significantly downregulated are marked blue; (E) Mapping of NfkB signaling
  pathway in burn injury rats. Each gene in the KEGG NFkB signaling network (KEGG
  rno04064) is colored according to its expression level in the burn injury group
  compared with that of the sham group. Genes that were significantly upregulated
  are colored red, and those that were significantly downregulated are marked blue.
  The ubiquitous expression level is indicated in grey. The gene that is shown in
  the blank was not measured in the experiment.
