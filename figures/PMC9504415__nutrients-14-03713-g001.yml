caption: Effect of pinostrobin on cell viability, intracellular melanin contents,
  tyrosinase activity in B16F10 cells. (a) Chemical structure of pinostrobin. (b)
  After treatment with various concentrations of pinostrobin for 72 h, the MTT assay
  was performed to analyze the cell viability. (c,d) After treatment under the same
  conditions used for the determination of cell viability, cells were collected and
  lysed to measure intracellular melanin content and tyrosinase activity. Cell viability,
  intracellular melanin contents, and tyrosinase activity in control cells were regarded
  as 100%. *** p < 0.001 and ** p < 0.01 compared with control group. NS; not significant.
