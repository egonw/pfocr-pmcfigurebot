caption: Negative regulation of MAVS signaling by antagonistic viral proteins. Viruses
  attempt to escape the host antiviral immune response through the help of specialized
  proteins. Different evasion strategies occur, such as cleavage or proteasomal degradation
  of MAVS, or direct binding to the signaling molecules for blocking RLR pathways.
  The names of the proteins are shown in brackets after their encoding virus. EBOV,
  Ebola virus; HAV, hepatitis A virus; HBV, hepatitis B virus; HCV, hepatitis C virus;
  HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus; hMPV, human metapneumovirus; HPIV, human parainfluenza
  viruses; HRVC, human rhinovirus C; IAV, influenza A virus; PRRSV, porcine reproductive
  and respiratory syndrome virus; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2,
  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses 1 and 2; SVV, Seneca valley virus.
