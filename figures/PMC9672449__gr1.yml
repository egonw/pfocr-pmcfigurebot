caption: Scaffold STE5 has pathway regulatory properties mediated via conformational
  changes. On the left is the traditional stable platform depiction of the three-tiered
  MAPK cascade modulated by STE5 in yeast, where α-factor binds to STE2 and a phosphorylation
  cascade involving STE11, STE7, and FUS3 is initiated. This leads to the eventual
  phosphorylation of the STE12 transcription factor to initiate transcription of mating
  response genes. On right is a more detailed depiction of the complexity of STE5’s
  role in the pathway. In unstimulated cells, STE5 is in a closed state where FUS3
  binding is blocked. After α-factor binds to its receptor STE2, STE5 is recruited
  to PIP2 at the plasma membrane. This causes a conformational change in STE5 to transition
  it to an open state such that FUS3 can bind to STE5. Upon binding to STE5, FUS3
  then undergoes a conformational change to be properly presented to STE7 for phosphorylation.
