caption: TSGs GADD45 B and PPP3CC  are correlated with patient prognosis in clinic.
  A-B. GADD45B and PPP3CC expression was positively correlated with patient survival
  outcomes by Kaplanâ€“Meier plots. C. The schematic diagram of the present study. Shikonin
  treatment activates the expression of GADD45B and PPP3CC through the JNK/P38/MAPK
  pathway, thus inhibiting the growth and migration of NSCLC cells
article_title: Shikonin reactivates TSGs GADD45B and PPP3CC to block NSCLC cell proliferation
  and migration through JNK/P38/MAPK signaling pathways.
