caption: Transcriptome analysis reveals BZBS improving inflammatory and SASP. The
  number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in RNA-seq analysis of young vs.
  aged and BZBS vs. aged in perirenal fat (A, B) and liver (C, D) shown in volcano
  plots. Intersection of DEGs in Venn diagrams for young vs. aged (Y vs A) and BZBS
  vs. aged (B vs A) in perirenal fat (E) and liver (F). KEGG pathway analysis of intersection
  DEGs in perirenal fat (G) and liver (H). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of
  TNF signaling pathway (I), IL-17 signaling pathway (J), and SASP (K) in perirenal
  fat and liver RNA-seq. The mRNA expression of inflammation-related genes by qRT-PCR
