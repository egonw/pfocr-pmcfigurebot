  analyses of TRIMs in patients with HCC. (A) Summary of TRIMs gene mutation analysis
  in HCC (cBioPortal). (B) Correlation heat map of different expressed TRIMs in HCC
  (TCGA). (Câ€“D) Gene functional enrichment of TRIM28, TRIM37, TRIM45 and TRIM59 in
  HCC. Top 10 biological processes, molecular functions and signaling pathways were
  collected in the table. (E) The network for TRIMs and the 20 most functionally similar
  genes as well as their pathways using genomics and proteomics data
