caption: The regulatory role of CASC11 and MYC on cell-cycle–associated genes. (A)
  ChIP-seq profiles from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements, showing enriched signals
  of MYC on promoter regions of CDK4 and CDK6. (B) Spearman correlation between CASC11
  and MYC or CDK4 or CDK6 in HCC clinical samples (n = 50). The gene expression in
  TCGA transcriptomic data was added with a pseudocount representing the lowest FPKM
  value and expressed as log2-transformed FPKM. Spearman correlation was used to evaluate
  the expression of data. (C) RT-qPCR analysis showing the expression changes of cell-cycle–related
  genes at 48 hours post-transfection with LNA targeting CASC11 or siRNA targeting
  MYC, respectively. Data are presented as mean ± SD from three independent experiments
  (D) Gene Ontology Pathway analysis showing the enrichment of common downstream targets
  as a result of CASC11 knockdown and MYC knockout. FC, fold change; FPKM, fragments
  per kilobase million; RT-qPCR, Quantitative reverse transcription PCR .
