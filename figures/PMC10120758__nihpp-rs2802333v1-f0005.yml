figure_title: Proposed stepwise pathway for enantio- and diastereoenriched enzymatic
  cyclopropanation
caption: (A) Calculated energy diagram for cyclopropanation (standard heme model at
  the B3LYP-D3(BJ)-CPCM(Et2O)/def2-TZVP//B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-SVP level of theory; energies
  are Gibbs free energies in kcal mol−1; superscripts correspond to the spin state;
  distances are given in Å); (B) Molecular dynamics simulations on the iron-carbene
  intermediate; (C) A proposed catalytic cycle of the biocatalytic cyclopropanation.
