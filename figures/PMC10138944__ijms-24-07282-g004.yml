caption: 'BVRA protein levels along with the activation of main proteins of the insulin
  signaling pathway were evaluated in HEK293 cells treated with 100 nM insulin for
  15, 30, 60, and 120 min. (A,B) Representative Western blot and total load images
  and densitometric evaluation of (C) BVRA protein levels; (D) IRS1 activation evaluated
  as a ratio between the IRS1 active form (IRS1Y632) and the IRS1 total protein levels
  (pIRS1Y632/IRS1); (E) AKT activation evaluated as a ratio between the AKT active
  form (AKTS473) and the AKT total protein levels (pAKTS473/AKT); and (F) MAPK activation
  evaluated as a ratio between the MAPK active forms (pMAPK42/44 T202/Y204) and the
  MAPK total protein levels (pMAPK/MAPK). Data are shown as mean ± SEM (n = 4–5 independent
  cultures/group) One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test: * p < 0.05, ** p <
  0.01.'
