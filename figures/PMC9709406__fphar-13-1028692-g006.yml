caption: The proposed action mechanism oficotinib-triazole derivativesin ESCC cells.
  Icotinib-triazole derivatives inhibits cell proliferation, induces apoptosis and
  cell cycle arrest of ESCC cells via EGFR-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase
  (MAPK) pathway, leading to the inactivation of RAS-Raf-MAPK pathway.
