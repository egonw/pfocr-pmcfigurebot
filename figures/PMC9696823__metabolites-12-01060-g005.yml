caption: MAPK Pathway was activated by NEFA and BHBA. (A–C) KEGG enrichment analysis
  of DEGs in BMECs treated with NEFA and BHBA. (D,E) Protein expression of MAPK pathway-related
  genes in BMECs treated with NEFA and BHBA. (F) PPI network of differentially expressed
  genes selected in the MAPK and TNF signaling pathway. Data are presented as the
  means ± SEM of three independent experiments. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01.
