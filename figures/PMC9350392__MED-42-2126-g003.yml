caption: 'Landscape of the potential drugs that target human enzymes and SARS‐CoV‐2
  enzymes, besides new drugs to treat COVID‐19. Most of the drugs proposed to treat
  SARS‐CoV‐2 are repurposed drugs that target viral enzymes (A) or human enzymes (B),
  although potential new drugs also rise. Regarding the development steps, some of
  the molecules are yet a theoretical approach and most of them are still in scan
  phase (in silico approaches) or in preclinical phase (in vitro or in vivo analysis),
  while a few molecules are already in clinical trials with COVID‐19 patients. All
  those steps, from the in silico studies to the clinical trials, are crucial before
  prescribing a drug, even a repurposed one, or a potential new drug to patients.
  Restoring ACE/ACE2 balance is one of the pharmacological approaches to treat COVID‐19,
  due to the systemic symptoms worsening caused by downregulation of ACE2 in lungs
  and monocytes, and to upregulation of the enzyme in pancreas. Considering the lower
  levels of ACE2, there are five ways that one can restore ACE/ACE2 balance, (b.1)
  providing a molecule that acts on the reaction axes coregulated by ACE and ACE2
  (ACE inhibitors; reducing Ang II activity by providing Ang II receptor blockers
  or soluble ACE2; stimulating molecules activated by ACE2, through Ang‐(1–7) agonists
  or providing exogenous ACE2 to the body, such as recombinant ACE2); and (b.2) administering
  a molecule that prevents SARS‐CoV‐2 from attaching to ACE2, by binding to the viral
  particle or to ACE2. It is worth to remember, however, that prescribing drugs to
  restore ACE/ACE2 balance should consider ACE/ACE2 balance in pancreas as well. In
  this context, since in pancreas, ACE2 in pancreas is upregulated instead of downregulated
  as in the lungs and monocytes, a drug prescribed to restore ACE/ACE2 balance may
  lead to opposite results in each of those organs or cell, and then, continuous monitoring
  of the organ functions is needed. Symbols: The symbols above each box correspond
  to the general study of each group of molecules. The symbols on the left of each
  molecule or box comprise the classification in new drug or repurposed drug. If a
  specific molecule of a given group was submitted to a distinct study type, differing
  from the other molecules of the group, other symbol is added to the right of the
  respective molecule. ACE, angiotensin converting enzyme; ACE2, angiotensin converting
  enzyme‐2; Ang II, angiotensin II; Ang‐(1–7), angiotensin‐(1‐7); CatB/L, cathepsins
  B and L; CatL, cathepsin L; ECMP, enzymes from the cholesterol metabolism pathway; EUA,
  emergency use authorization; FDA, Food and Drug Administration. iEUA, issued as
  emergency use authorization by the FDA; IgG1, immunoglobulin G‐1; Jak, Janus kinase
