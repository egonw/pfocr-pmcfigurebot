caption: Identification of differentially expressed miRNAs and the related KEGG and
  GO pathways enrichment of target genes. (a) Heatmaps of differentially expressed
  miRNAs between the LNCs and 3T3 groups. (b) KEGG pathway enrichment analyses of
  differentially expressed miRNAs. (c) GO pathway enrichment analysis of differentially
  expressed miRNAs. (d) miRNA-mRNA regulatory network with significant differences.
  (e) Relationship between the KEGG pathways and miRNAs with significant differences.
  All samples were performed two biological replicates separately.
