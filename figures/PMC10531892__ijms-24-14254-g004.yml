caption: 'TQ inhibited caspase-1 expression, IL-1β expression, and protein release
  in PBMCs of TNBC patients. (A–C) Caspase-1 expression versus TQ concentrations.
  PBMCs isolated from TNBC patients were treated with TQ (0, 20, 50, and 100 µM) for
  (A) 24 h, (B) 48 h, and (C) 72 h. (D–F) IL-1β expression versus TQ concentrations.
  PBMCs isolated from TNBC patients were treated with TQ (0, 20, 50, and 100 µM) for
  (D) 24 h, (E) 48 h, and (F) 72 h. (G–I) IL-1β protein levels (pg/mL) secreted from
  PBMCs of TNBC patients treated with TQ concentrations (0, 20, 50, and 100 µM) for
  (G) 24 h, (H) 48 h, and (I) 72 h. All experiments were performed in triplicate,
  and data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. Statistical analysis was
  performed using the GraphPad Prism software version 9.1.1. The data were analyzed
  using one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s multiple comparisons to compare each treated column
  and the DMSO control column (**** p value < 0.0001; *** p value < 0.001; ** p value
  < 0.01; * p < 0.05). TQ: thymoquinone; TNBC: triple-negative breast cancer; BC:
  breast cancer; ns: non-significant; IL-1β: Interleukin-1 beta; PBMCs: peripheral
  blood mononuclear cells; DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide.'
