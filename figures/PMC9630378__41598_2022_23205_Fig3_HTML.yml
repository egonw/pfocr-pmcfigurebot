caption: miR-874 induces p53-mediated cell death and suppresses cell proliferation
  in a p53-dependent manner. (a) Changes in the expression levels of c-Myc and p53
  with miR-874 transfection over time. MCF-7 cells were transfected with control (cont)
  miRNA or miR-874. The cells were harvested at the indicated time points and subjected
  to western blotting. Representative western blot images are shown (left). A line
  chart showing changes in the expression levels of c-Myc and p53 (right). n = 5,
  mean ± SD, *p < 0.05 (Student’s t test). See also Supplementary Fig. S3. (b) Annexin
  V time-course study. MCF-7 cells were transfected with cont miRNA or miR-874. The
  cells were harvested at the indicated time points and subjected to an annexin V-633/propidium
  iodide (PI) double-staining assay. Representative images are shown (left). The percentages
  of annexin V-positive cells/PI-negative (lower right, early apoptosis) and annexin
  V-positive/PI-positive cells (upper right, late apoptosis) were quantified (right).
  n = 3 per group, mean ± SD, *p < 0.05, ****p < 0.0001 (Student’s t test). (c) EdU
  time-course study. MCF-7 cells were transfected with cont miRNA or miR-874. The
  cells were harvested at the indicated time points and subjected to the EdU assay
  using flow cytometry analysis. Representative images are shown (left). The proportions
  of cells in the S phase, G0/G1 phase, and G2/M phase were quantitated and plotted
  (right). n = 3, mean ± SD, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001 (Student’s t
  test). (d) WT, p53 knockout (KO), and p53/c-Myc double-knockout (DKO) MCF-7 cells
  were transfected with either cont miRNA or miR-874. After 40 h, the cells were harvested
  and subjected to western blotting. (e) WT, p53 KO, and p53/c-Myc DKO MCF-7 cells
  were transfected with either cont miRNA or miR-874. After 48 h, the cells were harvested
  and subjected to annexin V-633/PI double staining. Representative images are shown.
  (f) The percentages of annexin V-633-positive/PI-negative cells and annexin V-633-positive/PI-positive
  cells were quantified. n = 3, mean ± SD, ****p < 0.0001 (one-way ANOVA). (g) FPKM
  values for BAX and PUMA from RNA-seq analysis for WT, p53 KO, and p53/c-Myc DKO
  MCF-7 cells (n = 3 per group, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001,
  one-way ANOVA).
