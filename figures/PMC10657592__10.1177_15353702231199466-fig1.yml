caption: '(A) TGF-β signaling via SMAD-dependent and SMAD-independent pathways to
  regulate CTGF-mediated ECM production. TGF-β signaling is initiated by binding of
  the ligand with the receptors. In SMAD pathway, the activated receptors phosphorylate
  SMAD 2 and SMAD 3 together with SMAD 4 to promote CTGF expression. SMAD 7 acts as
  inhibitory mediator for further stimulation of SMAD signaling. In SMAD-independent
  pathway, TGF-β activates MAP3K at scaffold protein, JNK-interacting protein-1, which
  facilitates the activation of MAP2K and JNK MAPK. JNK can also be activated by TAK1
  upon polyubiquitylation with TRAF6 at the ligand-bound TGF-βR. Binding of the TGF-βR
  causing autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues recruits Shc and Grb2. The Shc-Grb2
  complex binds to SOS that activates Rac1 and Ras GTPases. Rac1 activates Raf to
  phosphorylate MKK3/6 and stimulate p38. Ras activates Raf to phosphorylate MEK1
  which stimulates ERK1/2. TGF-βR also activates ROCK signaling leading to phosphorylation
  of JNK and p38. The activation of these MAPK signaling molecules JNK, p38, and ERK1/2
  induces the expression of CTGF for ECM synthesis. YAP/TAZ involves binding with
  the SMAD 2/3/4 complex and directly translocates into the nucleus. The siRNA inhibits
  the transcription of CTGF gene. The transcription of CTGF gene promotes the CTGF
  protein synthesis and secretes extracellularly. TGF-β: transforming growth factor
