caption: 'Other mutation-independent mechanisms of NOTCH1 in CLL. (A) NOTCH1 activation
  is mostly dependent upon microenvironmental interactions. Immunoblot and flow cytometric
  detection of NICD in NOTCH1-wild-type (MEC1) and NOTCH1-mutated (3′UTR mutation,
  CI) CLL-like cell lines, cultured at low (L, 0.054 × 106 cells/cm2) and high (H,
  3 × 106 cells/cm2) concentration for the indicated time. Samples at time zero were
  collected after an overnight culture at low concentration. For the high exposure
  blot, a gamma correction of 0.5 was applied to enhance visibility. Blots are derived
  from one single gel and are separated only for presentation purposes. (B) Other
  modulators of NOTCH1 signaling recurrently mutated in CLL. FBXW7, MED12 and SPEN
  are highlighted in bold. (C) Putative model for the interaction between Wnt and
  Notch pathways mediated by DVL2 in the context of SF3B1 mutations. DVL2, a key component
  of the Wnt pathway, is reported to act as a negative regulator of NOTCH1 either
  by direct interaction with NICD (dashed lilac line) or by sequestering RBP-Jκ, reducing
  its bioavailability to NICD (solid lilac line). SF3B1 mutations induce alternative
  splicing of DVL2 (altDVL2) which is less proficient in the interaction with RBP-Jκ
  (solid pink line, right side). (D) Proposed model of BCR-mediated NOTCH1 activation.
  Unengaged Notch receptors are internalized for recycling; chemical adjustments in
  the endocytic compartment, with progressive acidification and efflux of calcium
  result in destabilization of the NRR and prime the receptor for cleavage. Active
  PKC, elicited by BCR signaling, triggers co-endocyted ADAM-metalloproteases which
  initiate processing of the Notch receptor. Abbreviations: a.u, densitometric arbitrary
  units; mfi, mean fluorescence intensity; SF3B1, splicing factor 3 subunit 1; WNT,
