caption: Impact of SF3B1R625G on nascent protein synthesis and translation fate of
  the SF3B1R625G-induced splicing transcripts. (A) Nascent protein synthesis in SF3B1WT
  and SF3B1R625G Mel202 cells by Click-iT L-azidohomoalanine (AHA) labeling. The cells
  were starved of methionine for 1 h and incubated with AHA for 3 h. Lysates underwent
  a Click-iT reaction in which azide tags reacted with alkyne-biotin and biotin was
  visualized by immunoblotting. Cycloheximide-treated (CHX) cell lysates were used
  as a control for protein synthesis inhibition. β-actin was immunoblotted as a control
  for protein quantity. (B) Polysome profiles of the SF3B1WT (blue) and SF3B1R625G
  (orange) Mel202 cells. The sequenced samples are highlighted (pooled monosome fractions
  2–8; and pooled polysome fractions 9–14). The sucrose gradient 15–50% of sample
  fractioning is displayed. (C) The log2FC(normalized expression in polysome fractions/
  normalized expression in monosome fractions) of the SF3B1R625G cells as determined
  by RNA-seq is plotted for each aberrantly spliced transcript (p-values ≤ 10−5).
  The aberrantly spliced transcripts with positive log2FC values (group A) are relatively
  more translated than their corresponding canonically spliced transcripts, while
  those with negative log2FC values (group B) are less translated than their corresponding
  canonically spliced transcripts. ARMC9 and DPH5 are highlighted. (D) The aberrant
  splice index (aberrantly spliced transcript/canonical transcript) obtained by RT-qPCR
  for the SF3B1R625G-sensitive genes DPH5 and ARMC9 is plotted for each fraction from
  SF3B1WT (blue) and SF3B1R625G (orange) Mel202 cells. (E) KEGG pathway enrichment
  analysis of the translated aberrantly spliced transcripts (group A) identified by
  polysome profiling (C). The enriched KEGG pathways are represented against the minus
  log p-value. Only significant splice transcripts are displayed (p-value ≤ 10−5).
