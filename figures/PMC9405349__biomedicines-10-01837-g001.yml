caption: GLUT3 promotes EMT in HCT116 cells. (A) HCT116 cells were transfected with
  GLUT3/pEJ-3HA (2 µg) for 24 h. Western blot analysis was performed to measure the
  protein levels of GLUT3, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, snail, twist, α-SMA, CTGF, fibronectin,
  vimentin, PAI-1 and ZEB1. (B) qRT-PCR was performed to measure the mRNA levels of
  GLUT3, E-cadherin (E-cad), N-cadherin (N-Cad), snail, twist, α-SMA, CTGF, fibronectin
  1 (FN1) and vimentin (Vim), PAI-1 and ZEB1. (C) The E-cad-Luc or α-SMA-Luc plasmids
  were transfected with GLUT3/pEJ-3HA into HCT116 cells for 24 h. Cell extracts were
  harvested, and the luciferase assay was performed. (D) Cell invasion was analyzed
  after 48 h post transfection with GLUT3/pEJ-3HA (2 µg) to allow for the permeabilization
  of the transwell membrane. The membrane was stained with 0.2% crystal violet. Scale
  bar, 100 µm. GLUT3, glucose transporter 3; α-SMA, α-smooth muscle actin; PAI-1,
  plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; ZEB1, zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1, qRT-PCR,
  quantitative reverse transcription PCR; CTGF, connective tissue growth factor. Data
  are the mean ± standard deviation. Statistical significance was analyzed by analysis
  of variance. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001, significantly different
  compared with control.
