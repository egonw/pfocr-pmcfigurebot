caption: (A) The 2D structure of ICA. (B) The Venn diagram reports the intersection
  of targets in TNBC and ICA. (C) The PPI network with total nodes of ICA. Circular
  nodes represent targets and rhombic nodes represent ICA. Edges represent interactions
  between ICA and targets. (D) The KEGG enrichment pathway analysis. (E) The GO enrichment
  analysis of key targets. (F) Principal component analysis (PCA) plot of stromal
  molecular signature of TNBC patients tissue samples and normal breast tissue samples.
  Shapes and Ellipses show clustering of the samples. (G) Heatmap of stromal molecular
  signatures of TNBC and normal samples. Clustering of the samples showed by the annotations
  on top of the heatmap. The gene expression is displayed in (H), with significant
  statistical difference (p < 0.01).
