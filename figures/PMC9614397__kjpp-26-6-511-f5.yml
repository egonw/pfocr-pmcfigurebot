figure_title: Neogambogic acid (NGA) suppressed p38 MAPK/NF-κB signaling in septic
  mice
caption: (A) NGA reduced protein expression of p-JNK and p-p38 in heart tissues of
  lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mice. (B) NGA reduced protein expression of TLR4
  and p-NF-κB in heart tissues of LPS-induced mice. ** vs. sham, p < 0.01. ^^vs. LPS,
  p < 0.01.
