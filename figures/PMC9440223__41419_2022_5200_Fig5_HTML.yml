figure_title: KCTD9 binding to ZNT9 competes with ZNT9 binding to β-catenin
caption: A Protein-protein interaction network predicted for KCTD9 using the Search
  Tool for Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) database. B Recombinant
  Flag-tagged (3xF)-KCTD9 was immunoprecipitated from HCT-116 cells to identify putative
  KCTD9-binding proteins. Coomassie blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel compares control IgG
  versus Flag immunoprecipitates with the highlighted bands identified as KCTD9 and
  ZNT9 using mass spectrometry. Data shown represent three independent experiments.
  C Venn diagram showing intersecting candidate KCTD9-binding proteins identified
  from the analyses in A, B. D, E Western blotting verification that ZNT9 co-precipitates
  with ectopically expressed 3xF-KCTD9 and conversely that KCTD9 co-precipitates with
  ZNT9 in HCT-116 cells. Data shown represent three independent experiments. F Western
  blotting analysis of ZNT9, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin, and SNAIL in LoVo and
  SW620 cells after knockdown of ZNT9. Data shown represent three independent experiments
  (top) and relative density were quantified by using ImageJ software (bottom). G
  Western blotting analysis of β-catenin, c-Myc, cyclin D1, and MMP-7 in total cell
  lysates and β-catenin in nuclear isolates of the ZNT9 knockdown cells from (F).
  β-actin and PCNA were used as loading controls for total and nuclear proteins, respectively.
  Data shown represent three independent experiments (top) and relative density were
  quantified by using ImageJ software (bottom). H, I SW620 cells were transfected
  with the indicated constructs and immunoprecipitation (IP) analyses used to detect
  protein-domain interactions between KCTD9 and the indicated HA-tagged constructs
  of ZNT9 (FL, P1, P2, and P3) or ZNT9 and the indicated Flag-tagged constructs of
  KCTD9 (FL, P1, and P2). Data shown represent three independent experiments. J, K
  Co-immunoprecipitation assays were conducted in SW620 cells measuring interactions
  between β-catenin and ZNT9 and ZNT9 and β-catenin in the absence or presence of
  KCTD9 overexpression. Data shown represent three independent experiments (left)
  and relative density were quantified by using ImageJ software (right). L Mammalian
  two-hybrid assays in SW620 cells measuring interactions between ZNT9 and β-catenin
  in the absence or presence of KCTD9 overexpression. F, G are mean ± SD; n = 3 independent
  experiments, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison post-test, *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. J, K are mean ± SD, n = 3 independent experiments, two-tailed
  Student’s t test, **p < 0.01. L Is mean ± SD, n = 3 independent experiments, two-way
  ANOVA with Bonferroni’s multiple comparison post-test, **p < 0.01.
