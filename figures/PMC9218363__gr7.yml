caption: Western blot analysis of AKT/mTOR/4EBP1, apoptotic pathway proteins, and
  apoptosis of FOLFOX-HT29 cells treated with NSC49L and TRAIL either alone or in
  combination for 24 h(A and B) Western blots demonstrating the regulation of the
  AKT/mTOR/4EBP1 pathway by NSC49L and TRAIL in FOLFOX-HT29 cells.(C) Levels of apoptotic
  proteins. All of the blots are the representative of three experiments.(D) Caspase
  3/7 activity. FOLFOX-HT29 cells were treated with NSC49L and TRAIL either alone
  or in combination for 24 h, and the extent of apoptosis was determined by measuring
  the activation of caspase 3/7 using a flow cytometer. The experiment was repeated
  twice. Data are the mean ± SE of triplicate results. See also .
