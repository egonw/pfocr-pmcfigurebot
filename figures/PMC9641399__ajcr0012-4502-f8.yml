caption: 'The Wnt/β-catenin pathway regulated integrin β1/FAK in HCT-8 cells. (A)
  The activation of Wnt/β-catenin and integrin β1/FAK and the expression of their
  downstream signaling molecules in the cells treated with different concentrations
  of pyrvinium pamoate (PP), an inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin for 48 h were determined
  by Western blotting analysis using GAPDH as internal control. (B) The relative integrin
  β1 promoter activity of the cells co-transfected with integrin β1 reporter plasmid,
  pcDNA3.1(+)-TCF4 and pcDNA3.1(+)-β-catenin plasmid and treated with 6 μM IVM for
  48 h was determined by Gaussia luciferase activity normalized to the activity of
  SeAP. (C) Chromatin IP was carried out with IgG (negative control) and anti-TCF4
  antibody. Q-PCR result for integrin β1 promoter region was shown as the percentage
  of input DNA. HCT-8 cells treated with vehicle or with empty vector pcDNA3.1(+)
  (mock) served as controls. Abbreviations: CTL, control. The blots shown in (A) were
  representative of two independent experiments. Data in the histograms were presented
  as the mean ± SD (n = 3). **P < 0.01, compared with their respective controls; ##P
  < 0.01.'
