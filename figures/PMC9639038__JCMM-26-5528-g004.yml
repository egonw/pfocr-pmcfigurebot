caption: 'Histone H3 antibody inhibited the expression of NOD2, HDAC6, p‐P65 and IκBα
  in LPS‐induced RAW264.7 cells. (A) NOD2 and HDAC6 mRNA levels measured by quantitative
  real‐time PCR. (B–D) NOD2, HDAC6, P65, p‐P65 and IκBα protein levels in RAW264.7
  cells detected by Western blotting. The cell experiment of Western blotting was
  repeated 3 times and quantitative real‐time PCR was repeated 6 times. Compared with
  the normal group, #p < 0.05; compared with the LPS group, *p < 0.05.'
