caption: TriL extenuated ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced brain damage in rats.
  (A) The presence of neuronal apoptosis within the cortex areas was determined using
  immunofluorescence staining of TUNEL/DAPI. Representative images of cells were stained
  with TUNEL (green), and the nucleus was stained with DAPI (blue). TriL treatment
  (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly reduced apoptotic cells compared with
  the control group. (B) Percentage of apoptotic cells in the brain of I/R rats. TriL
  significantly reduced apoptotic cells compared with the control group (*** p < 0.001)
  (n = 5). Original microscope magnification = 200Ã—.
