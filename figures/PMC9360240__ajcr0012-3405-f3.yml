caption: SHMT2 knockdown activates caspase dependent apoptotic pathway. A. Apoptosis
  rate was detected by annexin-V-FITC and PI double-stained cells combined with flow
  cytometry fluorescence separation in an HCC1806 cell line with SHMT2 knockdown.
  B. The apoptosis rate of each group was quantitatively analyzed. *P < 0.05, Student’s
  t-test. The data are presented as the mean ± SD of three tests. C. Western blot
  analysis of caspase-dependent proteins in HCC1806 with SHMT2 knockdown. D. Representative
  images of immunofluorescence to monitor cytochrome-c in HCC1806 with SHMT2 knockdown.
  Original magnification, 200 ×.
