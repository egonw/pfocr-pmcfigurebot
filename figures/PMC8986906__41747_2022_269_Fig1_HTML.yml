caption: 'The radiation-induced ATM nucleoshuttling: RIANS model and its current biomarkers.
  a In the frame of the RIANS model, IR induce the monomerisation of the ATM dimers
  in cytoplasm. The resulting ATM monomers diffuse in the nucleus and phosphorylate
  the H2AX histone variant molecular (γH2AX) at DSB sites, which triggers the formation
  of nuclear γH2AX foci, easily quantifiable by immunofluorescence. This is the recognition
  step. The recognised DSB are repaired by the non-homologous end-joining, the major
  DSB repair pathway in humans (see refs. [, –]). During the DSB repair process, two
  ATM monomers reassociate on the DSB sites and form the nuclear autophophorylated
  ATM (pATM) foci, also visible by immunofluorescence. b In the kinetics of γH2AX
  or pATM foci appearance, the early (10 min, 1 h) post-irradiation times provide
  information on the functionality of the DSB recognition step while the late (24
  h) ones provide information on the functionality of the DSB repair step. ATM Ataxia
  telangiectasia mutated gene/protein, DSB Deoxyribonucleic acid double-strand breaks,
