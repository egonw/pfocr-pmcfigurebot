caption: Effects of TCDD on the expression of genes associated with propionyl-CoA
  metabolism.A, schematic pathway depicting enzymes and metabolites associated with
  propionyl-CoA metabolism via the cobalamin (Cbl)-dependent carboxylation pathway
  or the Cbl-independent β-oxidation–like pathway. B, heatmap for dioxin response
  element (DRE) presence, AhR enrichment, and expression of genes associated with
  the propionyl-CoA canonical carboxylation pathway. C, heatmap for DRE presence,
  AhR enrichment, and expression of genes associated with the Cbl-independent propionyl-CoA
  β-oxidation–like pathway. Hepatic expression of genes associated with propionyl-CoA
  was assessed in a time course–and dose-dependent manner. In time course study, male
  C57BL/6 mice (n = 3) were administered a single bolus dose of 30 μg/kg TCDD, after
  which tissue was collected at the corresponding time point, while in dose-dependent
  study, male C57BL/6 mice (n = 3) were orally gavaged with sesame oil vehicle or
  TCDD every 4 days for 28 days. The presence of putative DREs (pDREs) and AhR binding
  to the intragenic region represents as green boxes. Color scale represents the log2(fold
  change) for differential gene expression determined by RNA-Seq analysis. Counts
  represents the maximum raw number of aligned reads to each transcript, where a lower
  level of expression (≤500 reads) is depicted in yellow and a higher level of expression
  (≥10,000) is depicted in pink. Genes that are diurnally regulated are denoted by
  “Y”. Disruption of diurnal rhythmicity following oral gavage with 30 μg/kg TCDD
  every 4 days for 28 days is denoted by an orange ‘X’. The ZT with maximum induction/repression
  is shown for each gene. Differential expression with a posterior probability (P1(t))
  > 0.80 is indicated with a black triangle in the upper right tile corner. TCDD,
  2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin; AHR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor; Cbl, cobalamin;
  ZT, zeitgeber time.
