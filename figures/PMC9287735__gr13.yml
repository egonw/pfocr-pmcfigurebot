caption: 'Effect of MSN-NGR1-CD11b antibody nanoparticles injected intravenously on
  PI3K/AKT, ERK1/2 and YAP signaling pathways. The levels of p-AKT and p-ERK1/2 were
  detected by WB (A–D). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 versus the MI group; ##P < 0.01 versus
  the MI + MSN-NGR1 group. AKT and ERK pathway could be obviously activated in cardiomyocytes
  according to immunofluorescence double labeling of cTnT + p-AKT or cTnT + p-ERK1/2
  (E, F). Immunofluorescence staining to detect the YAP nuclear translocation (G).
  Scale bar: 25 μm. The levels of cytoplasmic and nuclear YAP were detected by WB
  (H). *P < 0.05 versus the MI group; #P < 0.05 versus the MI + MSN-NGR1 group.'
