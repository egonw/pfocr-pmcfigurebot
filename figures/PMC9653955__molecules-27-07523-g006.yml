caption: Cell viability of HTB75 cells following treatment with F5 (a), F7 (b), F5-SM
  (c) or F7-SM (d), with or without CB1 and CB2 inverse agonists (IA), a TRPA1 blocker
  (B), and TRPV1 or TRPV2 antagonists (AN) for 48 h. Cells were treated with F5 (19.1
  µg/mL), F7 (19.4 µg/mL), F5-SM (14.7 µg/mL) or F7-SM (13.6 µg/mL), with or without
  the receptor IA, B or AN (10 µM). (e) The effects of IA, B or AN on viability of
  cells. Cell viability was determined by XTT assay at 48 h as a function of live
  cell number. Niraparib (6 µg/mL) served as a positive control. Control was vehicle
  control (1.47% v/v methanol + 1.00% v/v DMSO). Error bars indicate ± SE (n = 3).
  Levels with different Upper case letters were significantly different from all combinations
  of pairs according to the Tukey–Kramer honest significant difference (HSD; p ≤ 0.05).
