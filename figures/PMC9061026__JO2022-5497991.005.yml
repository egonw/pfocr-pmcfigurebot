caption: 'LA suppressed the migration and invasion capacities of VEGF-stimulated MKN-45
  cells. VEGF-stimulated MKN-45 cells were treated with LA for 72 h. (a) Transwell
  assays without or with Matrigel were carried out to evaluate the migration and invasion
  capacity. (b) The numbers of migrated and invaded cells were quantified. Scar bar
  = 100 μm. The data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3). ∗p < 0.05 vs. VEGF 0 ng/mL
  + LA 0 μM and ∗∗p < 0.01 vs. VEGF 0 ng/mL + LA 0 μM. #p < 0.05 vs. VEGF 20 ng/mL
  + LA 0 μM and ##p < 0.01 vs. VEGF 20 ng/mL + LA 0 μM. (c) Western blot analysis
  of EMT-regulated proteins MMP2, MMP9, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin.'
