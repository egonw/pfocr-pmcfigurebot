caption: Inhibition effect of TEE on LPS-induced MAPKs and NF−kB signaling pathway
  in RAW264.7 cells. (A) Cell lysates were extracted, and protein levels of (A) MAPKs
  (p−ERK, ERK, p-JNK, JNK, p−p38, p−38) and (B) NF-κB (IkB, p−p65) were analyzed using
  Western blotting. ImageJ software (version 1.46r) used was normalized to β-actin.
  The data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation of triplicate experiments.
  a–e Values with superscript letters differed significantly (p < 0.05, by Duncan’s
  multiple rages test).
