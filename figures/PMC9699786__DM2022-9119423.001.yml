caption: TP inhibited the proliferation, migration, adhesion, and angiogenesis of
  HUVECs. (a) A CCK-8 assay was used to determine HUVECs proliferation after treatment
  with TP (0, 12.5, 25, or 50 nM), DMSO, and endostatin (8 mg/L) for 24, 48, and 72 h.
  After treating HUVECs with TP (0, 12.5, 25, or 50 nM), DMSO, and endostatin (8 mg/L)
  for 24 h, the migration (b), adhesion (c), and angiogenesis (d) of HUVECs were measured.
  ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 versus the control group.
