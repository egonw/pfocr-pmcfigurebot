caption: 'MST2‐dependent STAT3 T622 phosphorylation impairs STAT3 dimerization and
  activation. C‐H, Immunoblotting analyses were performed using indicated antibodies.
  A, A schematic of the SH2 domain in STAT3 protein sequence. B, Human STAT3 protein
  structure (PDB code: 6TLC) shows the spatial location of the T622 site. The SH2
  domain is boxed and enlarged. T622 site is shown in yellow. C, DU145 cells with
  expression of HA‐STAT3 and Flag‐STAT3 at high (~80%) or low (~10%) density were
  treated with 50 ng/ml IL6 for 30 min. Immunoprecipitation was performed using an
  anti‐Flag antibody. D, DU145 cells with expression of HA‐STAT3, Flag‐STAT3 or MST2
  shRNA at high (~80%) density were treated with 50 ng/ml IL6 for 30 min. Immunoprecipitation
  was performed using an anti‐Flag antibody. E, DU145 cells with expression of WT
  HA‐STAT3, WT Flag‐STAT3, or indicated mutants at high (~80%) density were treated
  with 50 ng/ml IL6 for 30 min. Immunoprecipitation was performed using an anti‐Flag
  antibody. F, Purified GST‐STAT3, Flag‐STAT3, or indicated mutant protein was incubated
  with purified His‐MST2 protein for an in vitro kinase assay and then incubated with
  His‐JAK2 protein for another in vitro kinase assay. Immunoprecipitation was performed
  using an anti‐Flag antibody. G, Purified Flag‐STAT3 or indicated mutant protein
  was incubated with purified His‐MST2 protein for an in vitro kinase assay and then
  incubated with His‐JAK2 protein for another in vitro kinase assay. Size exclusion
  chromatography assay was performed. H, Endogenous STAT3‐depleted DU145 cells were
  stably expressed with WT Flag‐STAT3 and Flag‐STAT3 T622A. STAT3 shRNA targets noncoding
  region. I‐K, Endogenous STAT3‐depleted DU145 cells with expression of WT Flag‐STAT3
  or indicated mutant at high (~80%) density were treated with 50 ng/ml IL6 for 30 min
  (I‐J) or 2 h (K). DNA‐binding affinity (I) and transcription activity (J) of STAT3
  were measured. The level of IL6 mRNA was measured by RT‐PCR (K). L, M, DU145 cells
  with expression of MST2 shRNA at high (~80%) density were treated with 50 ng/ml
  IL6 for 30 min (L) or 2 h (M). DNA‐binding affinity of STAT3 was measured (L). The
  level of IL6 mRNA was measured by RT‐PCR (M)'
