caption: ECs upregulate innate immune signaling pathways at four but not 24 hpe to
  Bb(A–C) Volcano plots of differentially expressed genes (DE-Gs). The-log10 pvalues
  are plotted against the average log2 fold changes in expression. For each pair of
  compared conditions the upregulated genes of each group are shown in the corresponding
  color. Each panel refers to a different time after exposure as indicated.(D) PCA
  of top genes that have ANOVA p value ≤0.05 on FPKM abundance estimations. PC1 versus
  PC2.(E) Pathway enrichment analysis. Bb-exposed ECs were compared to unexposed ECs
  based on their enrichment score (-log10p). Resulting barplots for the different
  times after exposure are shown only for pathways that had-log10p>3. See also  and
