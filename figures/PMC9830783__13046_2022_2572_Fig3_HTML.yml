caption: Parvimonas micra regulate the MAPK signaling pathway. A Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis of the upregulated genes in the Pm-42 group.
  B Classification of upregulated genes in the Pm-42 group in the colorectal cancer
  signaling pathway. C After cells and bacteria were coincubated, Ras, ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2,
  and c-Fos were detected through western blotting. D Coincubation of the cells and
  bacteria in the presence of the PD98059 inhibitor and detection of Ras, ERK1/2,
  p-ERK1/2, and c-Fos through western blotting. E–F DMSO or PD98059 inhibitors were
  added to the coincubated cells and bacteria; the MTT assay was used to detect cell
  proliferation. Data are expressed as mean ± SD from 3 independent experiments
