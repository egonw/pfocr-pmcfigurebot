caption: The effect of solamargine on the viability and proliferation of cervical
  cancer cells. (a) The chemical structure of solamargine. (b) CCK-8 was used to evaluate
  the viability of cervical cancer cells under 0, 5, 10, and 20 μM solamargine treatment.
  (c) Colony formation assay was used to detect the proliferation of cervical cancer
  cells under 0, 5, and 10 μM solamargine treatment. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p
  < 0.001 vs. 0 μM. CCK-8, cell counting kit 8.
