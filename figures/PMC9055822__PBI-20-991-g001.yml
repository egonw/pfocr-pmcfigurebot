caption: OsPep3 elicits metabolic changes in rice leaf sheaths. (a) Volcano plot displays
  differentially produced metabolites with fold change (FC) > 2 and P < 0.01 at 24 h
  after OsPep3 treatment in five biological replicates. (b) Hierarchical clustering
  of OsPep3–upregulated metabolites at 24 h post–treatment. The abundances of each
  metabolite across different samples are shown as Z–scores of their intensity in
  the metabolome. (c) Fatty acids and derivatives are overrepresented in OsPep3–upregulated
  metabolites. (d) Palmitelaidic acid methyl ester (PAME) and ceramide–1–phosphate
  (C1P) represent most highly inducible metabolites by OsPep3. Data are shown as mean ± SD
  of five biological replicates. **P < 0.01 (Student’s t–test). (e) Joint profiling
  of metabolomics (left heatmap) and transcriptomics (right heatmap) indicates that
  the JA biosynthetic pathway is upregulated by OsPep3. The induction fold of each
  metabolite/gene by OsPep3 is indicated by the colour scale based on the log2 fold
  change.
