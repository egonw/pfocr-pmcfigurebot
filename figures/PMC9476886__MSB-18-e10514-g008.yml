figure_title: A detailed mathematical model recapitulates experimental results of
  both wt and tax‐6 mutant worms
caption: In the detailed model (see Appendix Note  part 4), we integrated the available
  dynamics of the AWA ion channels (Liu et al, ). To simulate circuit dynamics of
  tax‐6 mutants, we set the contribution of calcium‐mediated inhibition to zero (
  in equation  and shown in Fig ). A–C Calcium concentration and membrane potential
  as simulated by the model, alongside calcium imaging measurements of a representative
  worm in response to different stimulation patterns (top). (A) In response to a sigmoidal
  gradient, simulated tax‐6 worms fail to generate pulsatile activity, in agreement
  with the experimental results. Also, activity does not resume to its baseline levels.
  (B) Response dynamics following a first long on step (identical to experiment protocol
  described in Fig ). Experimental and simulated wt worms exhibit reduced amplitude
  responses (increased habituation) following the second on step. In contrast, tax‐6
  mutants did not show exact adaptation nor a reduced activity in response to the
  second on step (no habituation). (C) Response dynamics of wt worms following a first
  long (continues line) or short (dashed line) on step. A second on step following
  a short on step (and hence a long off step), elicits calcium levels that match the
  first step (purple). This contrasts with the attenuated response following a long
  on step (and hence short off step, blue). Even though in both protocols, calcium
  concentrations returned to baseline levels, the longer the off step, the higher
  the response activity to a second step (in agreement with experimental results,
  Fig ), suggesting that calcium‐independent processes contribute to the inhibition.
  Note the different y‐scale for the experimental results in panels (B) and (C).  Source
  data are available online for this figure.
