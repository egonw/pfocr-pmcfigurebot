caption: 'Immune function and signaling pathway enrichment result in three types of
  lymphoma. (A) Immune-related pathways enrichment results. (B) Signal transduction-related
  pathways enrichment results. The orange, blue and green lines represent the HL,
  DLBCL, and MCL, respectively. The line width indicates the enrichment percentage.
  The dotted line in the box indicates the significance threshold (FDR P-value = 0.05).
  Abbreviations: HL: Hodgkin''s lymphoma; DLBCL: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; MCL:
  mantle cell lymphoma.'
