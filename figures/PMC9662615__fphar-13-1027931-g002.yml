caption: 'Dose-response effect of V. album mother tinctures on MDA-MB-231 and HaCaT
  cell lines proliferation assessed by MTT. (A) MDA-MB-231 summer-dose effects after
  24 h of treatment with MTs. (B) MDA-MB-231 summer-dose response curve after 48 h
  of treatment with MTs (C) HaCaT summer-dose response effects after 24 h of treatment
  with MTs. (D) MDA-MB-231 dose response curves after 72 h of treatment with summer
  and winter MTs (A-S/W; Q-S/W). The final concentrations varied from 0.5 to 3.0%
  v/v. The results are calculated as the mean ± standard error from three independent
  experiments, done in triplicate, in relation to control groups (untreated and treated
  with ethanol). *p < 0.05; **p < 0.001; ***p < 0.0001 obtained with one-way ANOVA/Dunnet’s
  post hoc test. Legend symbols: (CT) control untreated cells; (Alc) cells incubated
  with ethanol solvent; V. album subsp. album growing on Malus domestica (M-S/W),
  Quercus petraea (Q-S/W) and Ulmus carpinifolia (U-S/W); V. album subsp. abietis
  growing on Abies alba (A-S/W); and V. album subsp. austriacum growing on Pinus sylvestris
  (P-S/W). Samples were harvested in summer (S) and winter (W) seasons.'
