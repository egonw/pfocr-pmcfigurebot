figure_title: Enriched metabolic pathways in response to toxicant exposure
caption: For the conditions for which there were enough differentially expressed genes,
  KEGG pathway enrichment is shown with blue indicating that a pathway is enriched,
  and white showing that pathways were not enriched. A select number of KEGG metabolic
  pathways are displayed on the y-axis, with experimental conditions listed on the
  x-axis. Pathways are clustered by Euclidean distance using complete linkage. Dendrogram
  not shown.
