caption: 'Nusinersen modulates amino acid and glucose metabolism in the CSF of SMA1
  patients. (A,D) PLS-DA score scatter plots showing the metabolomic profiles of CSF
  for SMA1 patients prior to treatment (T0) and at loading (T1) (A) or maintenance
  (T2) phases (D) of Nusinersen administration. PLS-DA was evaluated using cross validation
  (CV) analysis. The clusters analyses are reported in the Cartesian space that is
  described by the main components, PC1: 17.8% and PC2: 8.9% (T0 vs. T1 clusters,
  respectively) (A), and PC1: 15.5% and PC2: 12.2% (T0 vs. T2 clusters, respectively)
  (D). CV tests performed according to PLS-DA statistical protocol show a significant
  separation between T0 and T1 clusters (0.68 and 0.77 accuracy values for PC1 and
  PC2, respectively, and positive 0.14 and 0.43 Q2 indices) (A), and T0 and T2 clusters
  (0.70 and 0.67 accuracy values for PC1 and PC2, respectively, and positive 0.02
  and 0.03 Q2 indices) (D). The data reveal that Nusinersen induces metabolic changes
  in the CSF of SMA1 patients at both loading and maintenance phases. (B,E) VIP score
  graphs of the metabolites discriminating the CSF of SMA1 patients at T0 from those
  of the same patients at T1 (B) or T2 (E). Metabolites characterized by a VIP score
  > 1 are shown. (C,F) Diagram of the pathway enrichment analysis showing the effect
  of Nusinersen therapy on several biochemical pathways associated with amino acid
  and glucose metabolism in SMA1 patients at both T1 (C) and T2 (F). The number of
  molecules (hits) related to the specific metabolic pathway is shown within each
  bar (see also ). (G) Hierarchical heat maps generated by MetaboAnalyst software
  are based on the Euclidean distance and Wardâ€™s algorithm. The heatmaps are calculated
  based on the concentrations of discriminating metabolites with VIP > 1 in the CSF
  of SMA1 patients at T0, T1, and T2. For each metabolite, the bar color represents
  its abundance on a normalized scale from blue (low level) to red (high level). The
  dendrogram at the top is based on the similarity of the metabolomic profile relative
  to each sample cluster. The dendrogram on the left is based on the metabolite abundance
  profiles. This analysis highlights hierarchical separation of CSF metabolomic profiles
  at loading (T1) and maintenance (T2) phases from the baseline (T0). This confirms
  that Nusinersen administration induces changes in the metabolomic CSF profile of
  SMA1 patients.'
