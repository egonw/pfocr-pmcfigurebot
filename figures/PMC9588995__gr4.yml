caption: 'Subclustering of macrophages reveals cell heterogeneity induced by implant
  materials.a Subclustering of macrophages further identified five distinct subclusters.
  Visualized UMAP plot of macrophages is shown color-coded. b Violin plots of distinct
  phenotypic signatures for each macrophage subcluster. c Expression of canonical
  phenotype marker genes of inflammatory, tissue repair, and resolving macrophages.
  d Circle diagrams depicting the proportion of each macrophage subcluster in the
  SHAM, SS, PT, SLA, and SR groups. e Pseudo-temporal ordering of macrophages and
  the definition of subcluster along the trajectory with the pseudo-time information
  (up), distinctly differentiated subcluster (middle), and sample information (down),
  respectively. f,g Up-regulated genes in the IL-17 signaling pathway, oxidative phosphorylation,
  necroptosis, chemokine signaling pathway, phagosome, antigen process and presentation
  among macrophages, each point is depicted as a single cell. Cells with indicated
  signaling activation were colored in shades of purple-red, and those without signaling
  activation were colored in yellow. Boxplots between the targeted macrophages subcluster
  and the remaining four subclusters were shown on the right, the lists of genes used
  to compute enrichment are according to KEGG: ko00190 (oxidative phosphorylation),
  ko04657 (IL-17signaling pathway), ko04217 (necroptosis), ko04062 (chemokine signaling
  pathway), ko04145 (phagosome), ko04612 (antigen process and presentation).'
