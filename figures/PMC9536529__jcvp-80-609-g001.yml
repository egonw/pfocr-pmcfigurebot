caption: Sesn2 levels in aortic valves from patients with CAVD. A and B, Sesn2 expression
  in normal donors and patients with CAVD was examined by immunofluorescence staining
  (×400) and western blotting. C, Double immunofluorescence staining with anti-Sesn2
  and anti-F4/80 antibodies (×400). N = 10 for the normal group and 20 for the CAVD
  group. *P < 0.05 versus the normal group.
