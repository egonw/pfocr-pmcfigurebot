caption: Effect of IgPKD1 treatment on mTOR signalling pathway in Trigonocephaly (T)
  and Dolichocephaly (D) cranial cells. (A and B) T cranial cells were treated with
  IgPKD1 (1:50). Western blot analysis of cell lysates of T cranial cells using p‐mTOR,
  PTEN, p‐AKT, p‐p70S6K and p‐4EBP1 antibodies. Levels of p‐AKT (p < 0.001), PTEN
  (p < 0.01) and p‐mTOR (p < 0.01) were increased in T cells with IgPKD1 compared
  to mock cells. pp70S6K and p4EBP1 levels showed p = ns. (C and D) D cranial cells
  were treated with IgPKD1 (1:50). Western blot analysis of cell lysates of D cranial
  cells using p‐mTOR, PTEN, p‐AKT, p‐p70S6K and p‐4EBP1 antibodies. Levels of p‐AKT
  (p < 0.01), PTEN (p < 0.01) and p‐mTOR (p < 0.01) were increased in D cells with
  IgPKD1 compared to mock cells. pp70S6K and p4EBP1 levels showed p = ns. The histograms
  represent densitometry results of the phospho‐immunoblots normalized by total protein
  levels. Data were analysed by t‐test and represent the mean ± SD. The experiments
  have been performed in triplicate (Student's t‐test, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).
  Actin was used as a protein loading control. Representative Western blots are presented
