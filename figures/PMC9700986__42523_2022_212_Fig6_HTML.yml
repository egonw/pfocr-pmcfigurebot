caption: Metabolic pathway enrichment analysis was performed on differential metabolites.
  A KEGG pathways predicted in the fecal microbiota of the control and MSP groups
  using PICRUSt. Statistical analysis was carried out using STAMP software. B Differential
  metabolic pathways depicted up-regulated or down re-regulated metabolites involved
  in each metabolic pathway. p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant
article_title: Molecular characterization of gut microbiome in weaning pigs supplemented
  with multi-strain probiotics using metagenomic, culturomic, and metabolomic approaches.
