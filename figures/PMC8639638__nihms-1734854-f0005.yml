figure_title: Transcriptomic key pathway analysis of Bregs-TLR functional gene enrichments
caption: '(A). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of compiled RNAseq data from Naïve
  B, LPS-B, Bregs-CpG and Bregs-TLR cells. The enriched pathways are shown in the
  heatmap with positive (red) and negative (blue) gene enrichments. Red arrowheads
  indicated potential pathways relevant to Bregs-TLR functions. Transcriptional status
  of the TGF-β gene in naïve B, LPS-B, and Bregs-TLR cells as revealed by RNAseq (B)
  and scRNAseq analysis ((C), Feature and violin plots). (D). Assessment of TGF-β
  active form (viewed by release of the Latency-Associated Peptide: LAP) in CFSE-labelled
  B cells, stimulated with LPS and incubated for 48h with CTV-labelled Bregs-TLR (E).
  Overall LAP expressions are reported in dot plots; Each dot represent duplicates.
