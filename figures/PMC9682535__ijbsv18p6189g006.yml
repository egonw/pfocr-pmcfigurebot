caption: Nrf2 signaling pathway can inhibit B7-H1 gene expression and protein synthesis,
  while LPS promotes B7-H1 protein expression up to 48 h. (A) Nrf2 protein synthesis
  after Nrf2 knockdown and overexpression (shKEAP-1), as detected using western blotting.
  (B) Nrf2 and B7-H1 gene expression after Nrf2 knockdown (shNrf2) and overexpression
  (shKEAP-1), as detected using RT-PCR. (C and D) B7-H1 protein synthesis in RAW264.7
  macrophages, as measured using flow cytometry and statistical analysis. (E and F)
  Nrf2 and B7-H1 protein synthesis detected using western blotting and immunofluorescence;
  magnification, 800×. (G and H) B7-H1 protein synthesis in RAW264.7 macrophages treated
  with LPS at different time points, as detected using flow cytometry and statistical
  analysis. (I) B7-H1 protein synthesis at different time points, as detected using
  western blotting. All data are pooled from three independent experiments. Data represent
  the mean ± SD. ****P < 0.001, ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05; NS, not significant.
