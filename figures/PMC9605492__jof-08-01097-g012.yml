caption: Effect of Efe-AfpA and PAF on conidia germination of N. crassa wild type
  (A) and glucosylceramide pathway mutants (B,C). Conidia (100 μL of 1 × 105 conidia
  mL−1) were treated for six hours with either water or an antifungal protein at 10
  μg mL−1. One-hundred conidia were counted as either germinated or ungerminated.
  The data presented are the means and standard deviations of three replicates. For
  each N. crassa strain, columns with different letters indicate a significant difference
  in activity (p ≤ 0.05, one-way ANOVA).
