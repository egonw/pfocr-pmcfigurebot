caption: ARG restrained cervical tumor cell growth and enhanced cell apoptosis in
  vivo. (A) Representative images of tumors from nude mice in two groups, and the
  supervision of tumor volumes for successive seven weeks. **P < 0.01 (B) The monitor
  of mice body weight for sequential thirty-five days. (C) Tumor weight after nude
  mice were administrated with PBS or 50 mg/kg ARG for five weeks. **P < 0.01 vs.
  sham. (D) Representative images of IHC staining for Vimentin (Scale bar = 200 μm)
  and TUNEL staining (Scale bar = 50 μm). (E) The quantitative analysis of IHC staining
  for Vimentin and TUNEL staining with the histograms. **P < 0.01 vs. sham. (F) The
  relative protein expressions of p-FAK, FAK, p-paxillin and paxillin were detected
  by the Western blot. The results were normalized to GAPDH. **P < 0.01 vs. sham.
