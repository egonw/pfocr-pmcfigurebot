caption: 'mTOR signaling pathway. mTOR is activated by the presence of growth factors,
  glucose, amino acids, WNT at the cell-surface, and by several intracellular clues.
  Signaling to mTORC1 is stimulated by growth factors, WNT via PI3K/AKT signaling.
  In an environment with sufficient nutrients, the autophagy process is negatively
  regulated by mTOR. AMPK activation, starvation, or hypoxia inhibit mTOR. Rapamycin,
  the inhibitor of mTOR, represses autophagy, and regulates inflammation. There is
  cross-talk between inflammasomes and autophagy to maintain homeostasis among the
  inflammatory response against pathogens and inhibition of disproportionate inflammation.
  During mTOR inhibition of autophagy, NLRP3 inflammasome activation is enhanced,
  and this effect is reversed after rapamycin treatment. Metformin enhances autophagy
  and inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome via AMPK/mTOR signaling inhibition. mTOR is implicated
  in several biological processes: protein translation, cell growth/cycle progression,
  lipid synthesis, and mitochondrial metabolism. Created with BioRender.com. 4EBP1:
