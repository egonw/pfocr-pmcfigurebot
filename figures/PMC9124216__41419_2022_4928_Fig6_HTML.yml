figure_title: ADAM15 and CD151 co-expression in NSCLC
caption: A Hierarchical cluster analysis of microarray data (heat map) was performed
  to show differentially expressed proteins of A549 cells in different groups. Red
  and blue indicate high and low protein expression levels, respectively. B Data obtained
  from TCGA database (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) were analysed to detect the
  correlation between ADAM15 and CD151 mRNA levels in lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous
  cell carcinoma and total lung cancer cell lines. C Western blot analysis of the
  ADAM15 and CD151 protein levels in 15 randomly selected NSCLC tissues and paired
  noncancerous lung tissues. D NSCLC samples were co-immunostained with an anti-CD151
  antibody and anti-ADAM15 antibody. E Co-immunoprecipitation of ADAM15 and CD151
  is shown. Protein was immunoprecipitated and detected from parental A549 and H1299
  cells using a specific monoclonal antibody. Bars represent the mean ± SEM from three
  independent experiments. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
article_title: Integrin α3/α6 and αV are implicated in ADAM15-activated FAK and EGFR
  signalling pathway individually and promote non-small-cell lung cancer progression.
