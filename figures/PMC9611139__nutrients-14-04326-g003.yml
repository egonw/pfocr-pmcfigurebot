caption: Resveratrol is involved in the signaling pathway, which leads to AMPK activation.
  Resveratrol inhibits phosphodiesterases (PDE), thus increasing intracellular cAMP
  concentration. cAMP elevation leads to the activation of CaMKII with the consequent
  increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. Ca2+ activates CaMKKÎ², one of the upstream
  kinases of AMPK.
