caption: Growth of different strains of R. cellulolyticum. Strains were grown in minimal
  medium containing 2 g L−1 cellobiose (A) or 5 g L−1 cellulose (B). The strains are
  wild-type (black), MTLcuaD (red), MTLcuaD(pSOSzeroTm) (yellow), MTLcuaD(pSOScuaSR)
  (green), and MTLcuaD(pSOScuaDSR) (blue). Experiments were performed in triplicate,
  and bars indicate the standard deviation.
