caption: “Seesaw effect” of twin-engine Janus supramolecular nanomotors (catalase/Janus
  stomatocytes) via precisely controlling the motion. Velocity, tracking trajectories,
  and MSD of catalase/Janus stomatocytes in the presence of 0 wt % H2O2 or 0.75 wt
  % H2O2, and irradiation with (A) 0 mW, (B) 30.1 mW, and (C) 35.7 mW NIR laser light.
  All scale bars in the tracking trajectories correspond to 50 μm. Inserted schematic
  figures display the motion behavior of catalase/Janus stomatocytes in response to
  the different conditions. In the absence of NIR (inset image in A), catalase/Janus
  stomatocytes exhibit the properties of regular enzyme-powered nanomotors, which
  move faster by increasing the concentration of hydrogen peroxide fuel. Upon NIR
  illumination (inset image in B), the photothermal effect around catalase/Janus stomatocytes
  results in motion in the opposite direction of the motion induced by the enzyme-driven
  pathway. Two opposing forces generated on catalase/Janus stomatocytes are counterbalanced
  under specific conditions, resulting in halting the motion of the twin-engine Janus
  motors (inset image in C).
