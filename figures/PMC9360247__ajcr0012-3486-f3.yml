caption: 'Econazole inhibited the PI3K/AKT pathway in ADR and sensitive breast cancer
  cell lines. A. The expression levels of p-AKT (S473 and T308), P-gp, and Bcl-2 were
  decreased by Econazole in MDA-MB-231/ADR and MDA-MB-231 cells in a dose-dependent
  manner. The cells were treated with increasing concentrations of Econazole (0, 1,
  3, 10, and 30 μM) for 24 hours. Econazole had no effect on PI3K p110α or t-AKT.
  β-actin was used as a loading control. B. The expression levels of p-AKT (S473 and
  T308), P-gp, and Bcl-2 were decreased by Econazole in MCF-7/ADR and MCF-7 cells
  in a dose-dependent manner. The cells were treated with increasing concentrations
  of Econazole (0, 1, 3, 10, and 30 μM) for 24 hours. Econazole had no effect on PI3K
  p110α or t-AKT. β-actin was used as a loading control. C. Econazole and BYL719 significantly
  inhibited PI3Kα kinase activity in a dose dependent manner (IC50: 79.29±6.97 nM
  and 8.68±2.13 nM).'
