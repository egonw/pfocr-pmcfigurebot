caption: miR-449a regulates pro-senescence genes and modulates the Pi3K-mTOR signaling
  pathway with growth hormone (GH) treatment. (A and B) Relative expression of senescence
  markers p21 and p16 quantified with RT-PCR in GH-treated and transfected HUVECs.
  (C) Relative expression of miR-449a target Ccnd1 in control, mimic-transfected,
  and inhibitor-transfected cells. (D and E) Relative expression of Pi3ka and mTOR
  in control, mimic-transfected, and inhibitor-transfected cells. (F) Relative expression
  of Foxo1 with GH treatment. Relative expression (n = 4 per group) was quantified
  through RT-PCR and calculated using the 2−ΔΔCT method. Statistical analyses used
  independent t test (two groups) or one-way analysis of covariance with multiple
  comparisons (Tukey’s test). Values are mean ± SEM. *P value < 0.05, **P value <
  0.01, ***P value < 0.001, ****P value < 0.0001.
