caption: KEGG and GO enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes between
  high and low expression of ERBB2 groups. (A) 146 ERBB2-related differentially expressed
  genes were enriched in KEGG signaling pathways and GO annotations, such as the primary
  immunodeficiency. (B) GSEA analysis of 19433 protein-coding genes and 146 ERBB2-related
  differentially expressed genes showed that the genes involved in the primary immunodeficiency
  pathway were mainly 23 down-regulated genes in the ERBB2 high expression group;
  Gene expression was sorted by log2 (fold change).
