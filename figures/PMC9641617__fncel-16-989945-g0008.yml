caption: Changes in protein levels in MAPK signaling pathway after chronic alcohol
  exposure or TBCB interference, and distribution and protein levels of TBCB and α-tubulin
  in astrocytes after interfering with ERK1/2 signaling pathway. (A–C) Immunofluorescence
  showed that TBCB (green signal) was co-expressed with α-tubulin (red signal) in
  astrocytes both in the control group [Con (A)] and ERK1/2 agonist group [TPA (B)]
  or ERK1/2 inhibitor group [U0126, (C)]. (D) The number of astrocyte processes and
  mean gray value (MGV) of TBCB and MT in astrocytes and its processes (MGV = Integrated
  Density/Area) after interfering with the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. (E–G) Western
  blot analysis of phosphorylation levels and relative quantitative analysis of MAPK
  (ERK1/2, p38, JNK) signaling pathways in astrocytes under various interfering factors
  (n = 6, p < 0.05). (H) Western blot analysis of the ratio of p-ERK1/2 to ERK1/2,
  and protein levels of TBCB and α-tubulin in astrocytes after TPA pretreatment or
  after U0126 pretreatment (n = 6, p < 0.05). (A–H) Number of panels. *p < 0.05, **p
  < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.

  disorder of nascent astrocyte processes by regulating microtubule plus-end growth
  through binding with end-binding proteins 1 and 3 after chronic alcohol exposure.
