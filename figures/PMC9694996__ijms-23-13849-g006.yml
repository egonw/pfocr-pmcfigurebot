caption: Administration of rotenone differentially influenced the expression levels
  of calpain-1 and calpain-2 in the nigrostriatal pathway in rats. (A) A representative
  photomicrograph of Western blot analysis showed upregulation of calpain-1 protein
  expression in the striatum following rotenone injection in rats (upper panel). β-actin
  was used as a loading control. Quantification of the protein level detected in Western
  blot analysis suggests calpain-1 expression was significantly increased (p = 0.0005)
  after rotenone injection, and it was marginally decreased (p = 0.1171) following
  CP treatment (lower panel, N = 5–6). (B) A representative photomicrograph of Western
  blot analysis also showed upregulation of calpain-2 protein expression in the striatum
  following rotenone injection (upper panel). β-actin was used as a loading control.
  Quantification of the calpain-2 protein level suggests a significant increase (p
  < 0.0001) in calpain-2 protein expression in the rotenone rats as compared to control
  group (lower panel, N = 6–8). CP treatment significantly decreased calpain-2 protein
  expression (p < 0.0001) in rotenone rats. MW = molecular weight.
