caption: RNA-seq and transcriptome analyses demonstrate modulation of several pathways
  in favor of PCa inhibition upon treating CWR22Rv1 cells with VNPP433-3β. (A) Heatmap
  of the differentially expressed genes in 10 µM VNPP433-3β-treated CWR22Rv1 cells
  (lanes 4–6) for 48 h compared to the control (lanes 1–3), illustrating the clustering
  for each comparison of interest based on the Gene Expression Counts and Log Fold
  Change (LFC) for the Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs). Columns correspond to
  samples and rows correspond to genes. Scale bar represents a graded change in LFC
  where pink is higher LFC, gray is lower LFC. Gene expression values were derived
  from DESeq/DESeq2 normalized counts. (B) MA Plot showing the relationship between
  expression change (LFC, M) and average expression (log2 mean expression, A). Red
  points indicate the upregulated genes with FDR ≤ 0.05 and LFC ≥ 1 and blue points
  indicate downregulated genes with false discovery rate (FDR) ≤ 0.05 and log2-fold-change
  ≥ ±1. Dashed lines indicate the LFC cutoff values of ±1. Points colored in gray
  indicate the genes that are not significantly differentially expressed. Table shows
  the number of genes differentially expressed. (C) QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  shows that VNPP433-3β steered the transcription of multiple canonical pathways genes
  in favor of PCa inhibition. A positive z-score (orange bars) indicates the activation
  of the given pathway, and a negative z-score (blue bars) reflects the suppression
  of that pathway.
