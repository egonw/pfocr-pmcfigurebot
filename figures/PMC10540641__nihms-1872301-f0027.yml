figure_title: Synthesis pathways and mechanism of operation of a cell-laden injectable
  hydrogel based on clickable polysaccharides
caption: (a) Synthetic pathway for the synthesis of a conductive poly(Î²-amino ester)
  (PBAE)-TA macromolecular structure containing multiple acrylate and aniline tetramer
  (TA) chain-end functionalities and several redox-sensitive disulfide linkages. (b)
  Sequential click (fast) and enzymatic (slow) crosslinking of an injectable hydrogel
  containing stem cells. (c) Mechanism for formation of hypoxic microenvironment.
