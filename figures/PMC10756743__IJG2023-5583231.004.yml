caption: Heatmap of upregulated genes, involved in ECM-receptor signaling pathway.
  Yellow color indicates normal samples, and the gray color indicates tumor samples.
  Red color indicates higher expression level of genes in related sample, and the
  blue color indicates lower expression level. THBS2 has the most change in the expression
  level, as a significant high-expressed gene in the GC samples.

  Noncoding Diagnostic Biomarkers and Oncogenes of Gastric Cancer in the ECM-Receptor
  Interaction Signaling Pathway: Integrated System Biology and Experimental Investigation.'
