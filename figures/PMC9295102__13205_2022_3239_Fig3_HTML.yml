caption: The participation of 2-ABP can block the increased in Orientia tsutsugamushi
  induced TNF-α and Ca2 + signaling activity. Ca2 + metabolism can also decrease TNF-α
  release and expression. TNF-α production can be regulated by the MAPK pathway. 2-ABP
  inhibits the JNK and p38 signaling pathways while activating ERK to enhance HSP70
  over expression. HSP70 inhibits the translocation of NF-κB and suppresses TNF-α
  expression
article_title: Gene expression and involvement of signaling pathways during host–pathogen
  interplay in Orientia tsutsugamushi infection.
