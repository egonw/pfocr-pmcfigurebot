caption: IL‐36γ and IL‐36Ra reciprocally regulate the expression of cell‐adhesion
  matrix molecules during colon tumorigenesis. A) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
  of the transcriptome data of colon tumors from Il1f9 +/+ (n = 2) and Il1f9 −/− (n
  = 2) mice or Il1f5 +/+ (n = 2) and Il1f5 −/− (n = 2) mice that were induced colon
  cancer with the AOM/DSS protocol. B) GSEA analysis (left) and heatmap of selected
  genes (right) related to extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor interaction, focal
  adhesion, and cell‐adhesion molecules (CAMs) from the transcriptome data obtained
  in (A). C) qRT‐PCR analysis of the indicated genes in colon tumors from Il1f9 +/+
  (n = 8) and Il1f9 −/− (n = 8) or Il1f5 +/+ (n = 8) and Il1f5 −/− (n = 8) mice that
  were induced colon cancer with the AOM/DSS protocol. D) Immunohistochemistry images
  (upper) and the intensity quantification (lower) of COL6A1 in the tumors from wild‐type
  Il1f9 +/+ (n = 7) and Il1f9 −/− (n = 6) mice or Il1f5 +/+ (n = 7) and Il1f5 −/−
  (n = 7) mice that were induced colon cancer with the AOM/DSS protocol (left), VP
  (n = 7), VP9 (n = 6), and VP5 (n = 7) mice that were induced colon cancer with the
  AOM protocol (middle), or 5 month old Apc Min/+ (n = 7), Apc Min/+Il1f9 −/− (n =
  6) and Apc Min/+Il1f5 −/− (n = 5) mice (right). ES, enrichment score; NES, nonenrichment
  score; FDR, false discovery rate; FWER, family‐wise error rate. Hypergeometric test
  in A and B. Two‐tailed student's t‐test in C, D. Graph show mean ± SEM. C,D) Scale
  bars represent 1 mm (black) or 50 µm (red), respectively. B–D) Data are representative
  of two independent experiments.
