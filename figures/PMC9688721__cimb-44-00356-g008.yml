caption: Impact of quercetin on the NF-κB (p65) signalling mechanism in LPS-induced
  BIECs. BIECs were treated with 80 μg/mL quercetin in an environment of 5 μg/mL LPS
  for 6 h. The immunofluorescence for phosphorylation-NF-κB (p-p65) (red) was conducted
  and the nuclear dye 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; blue) was included. Scale
  bar = 20 µm.
