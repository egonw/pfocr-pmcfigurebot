caption: Mechanisms of activation of the complement system by Bothrops venoms. Bothrops
  venoms activate the complement system via classical pathways, some also via lectins
  or the alternative pathway. All Bothrops venoms cleave C3 and C4, resulting in the
  synthesis of anaphylotoxins C3a, C4a, and C5a, and the terminal complement complex
  causing activation of chemotaxis. * Components of the complement system that are
  affected by Bothrops venoms. Created with BioRender.com, accessed on 30 September
