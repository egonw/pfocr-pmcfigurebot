caption: Bufalin inhibits p50 nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) expression to drive M1
  polarization. (A) Signaling pathway enrichment analysis of different expressed genes
  in bufalin-primed bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) was performed by KEGG.
  (B) Gene set enrichment analysis showed the positive significant connection of NF-κB
  signaling activation with bufalin treatment compared with vehicle control. (C) The
  transcription level of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines was detected
  in the vehicle-treated or bufalin-treated BMDMs in the presence or absence of cardamonin
  (CA). (D) Representative immunofluorescence image (×200-fold) show the expression
  and distribution of p65 and p50 NF-κB in vehicle-treated or bufalin-treated BMDMs
  in the presence or absence of JSH-23. Scale bar=50 µm. (E) The expression of p50
  and p65 NF-κB in the nuclei and cytoplasm of the BMDMs on vehicle or bufalin treatment
  was detected by western blot analysis. Lamin and β-actin were used as loading control
  in the nuclei and cytoplasm, respectively. (F) Ubiquitination of p50 in vehicle-treated
  or bufalin-treated BMDMs were detected by western blot analysis. Equal amount of
  protein was immunoprecipitated by anti-p50 antibody and immunoblotted by anti-ubiquitin
  antibody. Data are shown as mean±SEM. *P<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001.
