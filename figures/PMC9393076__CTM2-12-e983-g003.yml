caption: High expression of circOMA1 was identified in bladder cancer (BC) and was
  related to poor prognosis. (A) The scatter plot was used to assess the differential
  expression of circular RNAs (circRNAs) between BC tissues and normal tissues. (B)
  Five upregulated circRNAs from the BC tissues were able to work as miR‐145‐5p sponges.
  (C) Has_circRNA_100242 displayed the highest expression correlation with miR‐145‐5p.
  (D) Schematic illustration showing that has_circRNA_100242 (circOMA1) is formed
  by head‐to‐tail splicing of OMA1 exons 2–8. (E) Agarose gel analysis of PCR production
  using circOMA1 divergent primer and convergent primer. (F) The qRT‐PCR showed that
  the circOMA1 and OMA1 expression after RNase R digestion. (G) Fluorescence in situ
  hybridization (FISH) for circOMA1 (red) and DAPI (blue) in 47 pairs of BC tissue
  microarray chip. Moreover, circOMA1 locates in BC cell cytoplasm. (H) The qRT‐PCR
  showed that the relative expression of circOMA1 was higher in BC tissues comparing
  to paired normal tissues. (I) The Kaplan–Meier plot showed that high circOMA1 expression
  patients had lower OS than low expression patients. (J) The high expression of circOMA1
  was highly associated with higher tumour grade, higher pathological T stage and
  lymph node metastasis in BC. (K) KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the mitogen‐activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) pathways were most affected. The data are shown as the mean ± SD.
