caption: Increased splenic 18F-FDG uptake induced by systemic STING activation does
  not require interferon signaling. (A) Pathway enrichment analysis of differentially
  expressed genes in splenic cell subsets from scRNA-seq analysis in . (B) Representative
  18F-FDG PET scans of control and STING agonistâ€“treated Ifnar KO mice (3 mice per
  group). NK = natural killer; T1-3 = distinct T cell subsets; Tregs = regulatory
  T cells; B1-6 = distinct B cell subsets; T/B doublet = T and B cell doublets; DC1-2
  = various dendritic cell subsets; Mk = macrophages; Nt/Mono = neutrophile/monocytes.
  **P < 0.01.
