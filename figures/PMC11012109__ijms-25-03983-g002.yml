caption: Summary of pathomechanisms of NETs in abdominal aortic aneurysms. Histones
  can induce smooth muscle cell (SMC) apoptosis through p38/JNK pathway activation
  [] or trigger SMC ferroptosis by PI3K/AKT inhibition []. NET interference with the
  Hippo-YAP pathway contributes to SMC transdifferentiation from a contractile to
  a synthetic phenotype with an associated pro-inflammatory secretion profile [].
  Proteases promote plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) activation and the release of
  IFN-Î±, leading to inflammation []. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) exacerbate inflammation and oxidative stress and further ECM and elastin degradation,
  which is mainly driven by neutrophil-derived proteases.
