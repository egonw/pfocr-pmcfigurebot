caption: 'Regulation of Histone acetylation and deacetylation by metabolism-generated
  acetyl-CoA and NAD+. Acetyl-CoA is an essential co-substrate of histone acetyltransferase
  (HAT) that is mainly generated from glycolysis and fatty-aid β-oxidation; it is
  required for histone acetylation, amino acid acetylation including forming n-acetyl-aspartate
  (NAA), n-acetyl-glutamate (NAG), and n-acetyl-ornithine (NAO), and fatty-acid synthesis.
  NAD+ is an essential co-substrate of NAD+-dependent histone deacetylases that includes
  Sirtuin proteins. NAD+ is consumed by glycolysis (2 molecules) and TCA cycle (3
  molecules), whereas it is regenerated from NADH oxidation via conversion of pyruvate
  into lactate and through ETC complex I. NAD+ is biosynthesized from quinolinic acid,
  the end product of tryptophan metabolism, catalyzed by the rate-limiting enzyme
  quinolinate phosphoribosyl transferase (QPRT). The NAD+de novo biosynthesis pathway
  is coupled with and regulated by the NAD+ salvage pathway. Regulation of NAD+ usage
  and production in MΦs controls Sirt deacetylase activity, and hence, histone acetylation
  level. Additional Symbols: ACLY, ATP-citrate lyase; NAM, niacinamide; NAMPT, nicotinamide
  phosphoribosylransferase; NMN, nicotinamide mononucleotide; NMNAT, nicotinamide
  nucleotide adenylyltransferase; Orn, ornithine; PHGDH, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase;
  p-Pyr, phosphopyruvate.'
