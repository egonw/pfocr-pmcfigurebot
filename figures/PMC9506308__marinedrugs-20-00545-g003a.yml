caption: 'Cell viability and antioxidant activity analysis of G. lemaneiformis polysaccharide
  and its degradation products on HepG2 cells. Note: (a) the effect of GLP and GLP-HV
  on HepG2 cell morphology (inverted microscope with 50× and 100×), (b) the cell viability
  of GLP and GLP-HV on HepG2 cells, (c) the T-AOC activity of GLP and GLP-HV on HepG2
  cells, (d) the CAT activity of GLP and GLP-HV on HepG2 cells, (e) the GSH-PX activity
  of GLP and GLP-HV on HepG2 cells, (f) the SOD activity of GLP and GLP-HV on HepG2
  cells, (g) the MDA content of GLP and GLP-HV on HepG2 cells. “*” represents a significant
  difference between the other groups and the model group, “#” represents a significant
  difference between the other groups and the NC group, and p < 0.05 indicates a significant
  difference. The black diamond squares in (b–g) represent the value of each indicator.'
