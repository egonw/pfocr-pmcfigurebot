caption: CC Inhibits mesothelial-OvCa crosstalk. (A). Representative images of the
  effect of CC on the adhesion of CMTMR-labelled OvCa cell lines to uncoated, and
  matrigel-coated plates, or mesothelial cells monolayers (scale bars, 100 µm). (B).
  Bars represent means ± SEM of quantification of fluorescent cells was quantified
  using Image J. n = 6/experimental condition, * p  <  0.05, Student’s t-test. (C).
  CC reduced adhesion of fluorescent-ID8 cells homing to mesothelium covering the
  omenta of C57B6 mice. Top, schema of the experiment; middle, photomicrographs of
  dissected omenta and adherent cells. Bottom, bars representing means ± SEM of fluorescent
  cells quantified using Image J. n = 5/experimental condition, * p  <  0.05, Student’s
  t-test. (D). Top, schema showing mono and coculture of MESO301 and SKOV3 cells.
  Bottom, Western blot of the effect of CC on the expression of total and phosphorylated
  p65RelA in mesothelial and OvCa monocultures and cocultures.
