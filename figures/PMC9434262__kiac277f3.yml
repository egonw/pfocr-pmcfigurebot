caption: CRK5 and CRK22 regulate the SA-signaling pathway involved in defense responses
  to Vd-toxins. A, Free SA accumulation induced by treating 7-day-old seedlings of
  Col-0, crk5 and crk22 mutants, and 35S:CRK5-1and 35S:CRK22-1 overexpression lines
  with 200 µg·mL−1 Vd-toxins for 24 h. Leaves treated with ddH2O were used as controls.
  Error bars indicate SD of three replicates. B–F, RT–qPCR analyses of the relative
  expression levels of SID2, NPR1, PR1, WRKY53, and WRKY70 in 7-day-old seedlings
  of Col-0, crk5 and crk22 mutants, and 35S:CRK5-1 and 35S:CRK22-1 overexpression
  lines after treating with 200 µg·mL−1 Vd-toxins for 24 h. Leaves treated with ddH2O
  were used as controls. Error bars indicate SD of three replicates. Different letters
  represent significant differences at P < 0.05, as assessed by one-way ANOVAs with
  Tukey’s honest significant difference post hoc tests.
