caption: Pathway enrichment and clinical phenotype-correlation analyses of metabolic
  signatures. a Expression level-based quantitative pathway enrichment analysis of
  the differentiated metabolites that distinguished the HoFH group from the non-FH
  and HeFH groups. The bubble size refers to the enrichment ratio of the pathway and
  the color represents the natural log of the FDR-adjusted P value. b IPA-based functional
  network between the HoFH-associated metabolites and enriched biological pathways/diseases.
  Rectangles, nodes, and edges represent metabolites, functional pathways/diseases,
  and associations, respectively. c Correlation plot depicting the correlation of
  clinical lipids with corneal arcus/xanthomas, supravalvular aortic stenosis, and
  valvular aortic stenosis, using regression analyses (FDR-adjusted *P < 0.05; FDR-adjusted
  **P < 0.01). d–f Correlation plot depicting the relation of metabolomic features
  with corneal arcus/xanthomas, supravalvular aortic stenosis, or valvular aortic
  stenosis (FDR-adjusted *P < 0.05; FDR-adjusted **P < 0.01). LDL-C low-density lipoprotein
  cholesterol, HDL-C high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, Lp(a) lipoprotein (a),
  ApoA1 apolipoprotein A1, ApoB apolipoprotein B. Other abbreviations are shown in
