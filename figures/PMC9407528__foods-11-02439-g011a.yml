caption: Activation of NF-κB signaling pathway induced by individual flavonoids (chrysin,
  pinocembrin, galangin, and pinobanksin) and propolis extract in 10 μg/mL LPS-induced
  H9c2 cells. H9c2 cells were stimulated with different concentrations of phytochemicals
  (chrysin, pinocembrin, galangin, pinobanksin, and propolis extract) for 12 h and
  then treated with 10 μg/mL LPS for 12 h; finally, the activation of the NF-κB signaling
  pathway was detected via Western blot. (A) Activation of NF-κB signaling pathway
  in chrysin-induced H9c2 cells. (B) Activation of NF-κB signaling pathway in pinocembrin-induced
  H9c2 cells. (C) Activation of NF-κB signaling pathway in galangin-induced H9c2 cells.
  (D) Activation of NF-κB signaling pathway in pinobanksin-induced H9c2 cells. (E)
  Activation of NF-κB signaling pathway in propolis-extract-induced H9c2 cells. Values
  are expressed as the mean ± SEM (n = 3). Values with different letters (a, b, c,
  d, e, f) in the figure showed significant differences at p < 0.05.
