caption: TLE-regulated pathways in AML and T-ALL development. On the one hand, deletion
  of a portion of the long arm of chromosome 9, del (9q), or CpG island hypermethylation
  in the TLE1 promoter causes genetic or epigenetic silencing of TLE1 and TLE4 in
  AML cells. The loss of TLE1/TLE4 disrupts the TLE/HES1/HDAC complex, which otherwise
  inhibits AML growth by increasing p53/p21 and decreasing Bcl-2 expression (). Loss
  of HES1/TLEs may also promote AML growth by derepressing FLT3 expression () and
  enhancing Wnt signaling activation. On the other hand, AML oncogenic events promote
  cell proliferation and disrupt the terminal differentiation of myeloid cells, both
  of which are required for AML development. Notch activation promotes T-ALL development
  by several means. It directly upregulates the Notch target gene MYC to promote tumor
  cell survival. Notch activation inhibits E47, which leads to committed T lineage
  differentiation of T-ALL cells. In addition, Notch activates HES1 expression and
  suppresses the expression of PTEN and CYLD, thereby enhancing PI3K and NF-ÎºB pathway
  activation and cell proliferation.
