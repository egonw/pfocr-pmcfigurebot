caption: 'Effect of XFBD on IgG-IC-induced production of proinflammatory mediators
  in macrophages. MH-S were pretreated with IgG-IC for 1h and then incubated with
  5% or 10% CONs or XFBDs respectively, for 24 h. (A) ELISA analysis of the contents
  of IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α and MCP-1. (B) RT-PCR analysis of IL-6, IL-1β, IL-18 and MCP-1.
  (C) Western blot analysis of IL-18 and IL-1β. Data are shown as the mean ±SD of
  at least three independent experiments. *p<0.05 vs. control; #p<0.05 vs. the 10%
  CONs group.'
