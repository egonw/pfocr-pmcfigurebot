caption: 'Mice treated with rotenone exhibit C/EBP/AEP pathway activation, α-syn aggregation,
  and TH-positive neuron loss in the SN, and these effects are dependent on the gut
  microbiota.(A–D) Protein levels of C/EBPβ, AEP, p-α-syn, and MAOB in the midbrain
  containing the SN in the Con and Rot groups. (E–H) Protein levels of C/EBPβ, AEP,
  p-α-syn, and MAOB in the midbrain containing the SN in the Con + Ab and Rot + Ab
  groups. (I, J) Representative immunofluorescence images of the SN showing nuclei
  (DAPI, blue), total TH-positive neurons (TH, green), and α-syn (p-α-syn Ser129,
  red). Scale bars: 100 μm. (K) Rotarod test results for the Con and Rot groups. The
  Y-axis shows the time spent on the rotarod. (L) Pole test results for the Con and
  Rot groups. The Y-axis shows the time of descent from the top of the pole to the
  ground. (M) Rotarod test results for the Con + Ab and Rot + Ab groups. The Y-axis
  shows the time spent on the rotarod. (N) Pole test results for the Con + Ab and
  Rot + Ab groups. The Y-axis shows the time of descent from the top of the pole to
  the ground. Values are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (n = 6). *P
  < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, vs. Con. Con: control; Rot: rotenone; Con + Ab:
  Con mice treated with antibiotics; Rot+Ab: Rot mice treated with antibiotics. AEP:
  Mammalian asparagine endopeptidase; C/EBPβ: CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β; DAPI:
  4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; MAOB: monoamine oxidase B; SN: substantia nigra;
  TH: tyrosine hydroxylase; α-syn: α-synuclein.'
