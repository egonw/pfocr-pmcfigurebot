caption: MiR‐2355‐5p participates in effects on 5‐FU resistance associated with TMEM44‐AS1
  knockdown in cells with 5‐FU resistance. A) RT‐qPCR was used to detect the expression
  of TMEM44‐AS1 after infection with si‐NC + pre‐NC, si‐NC + pre‐miR‐2355‐5p, si‐TMEM44‐AS1+pre‐NC,
  si‐TMEM44‐AS1+pre‐miR‐2355‐5p, si‐NC+anti‐NC, si‐NC+anti‐miR‐2355‐5p, si‐TMEM44‐AS1+anti‐NC,
  or si‐TMEM44‐AS1+anti‐miR‐2355‐5p. B) 5‐FU (5 μg mL−1) was added to cell medium,
  cell proliferation ability in different HGC‐27/R and MKN‐45/R cell lines experimental
  groups were detected by CCK8 assay. The relative proliferative rates at different
  time points were normalized to 0 h. C) Cell proliferation ability in different HGC‐27/R
  and MKN‐45/R cell lines experimental groups were detected by EdU assay. Scale bar,
  20 µm. D) Cell apoptosis rate was detected for both resistant cells by flow cytometry
  analysis. E) Protein expression levels of ABCC1 and ABCG2, Survivin, Caspase3, cleaved
  caspase3, and GAPDH were detected by western blotting. F) Protein expression levels
  of p53, AIFM2, Bcl‐2, Bax, and GAPDH in HGC‐27/R and MKN‐45/R cells. 5 µg mL−1 5‐FU
  was used to treat cells for a 48‐h period before EdU assay, flow cytometric analysis,
  and protein extraction. Data are mean ± SD, n = 3. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P <
  0.001.
