caption: 'Role of CIPK-CBL complexes in managing cold stress in Arabidopsis. Many
  genes are involved in this response. Cold stress is first perceived by COLD1 receptors.
  The signals activate the secondary Ca2+ messengers. The transient changes produced
  in a cell due to Ca2+ activation and AtSRC2 produce ROS due to the NADPH oxidase
  activity of the AtRBOHF. Increased ROS production positively regulates the Ca2+
  channels. CBL1-CIPK plays a role by phosphorylating and activating the MAPK cascades.
  CRLK1 or CRLK2 interacts with calmodulin (CaM) to further activate the MAPK cascade.
  The MAPK pathway suppresses the breakdown of ICE1 to tolerate stress. Dashed lines:
  unclear mechanisms; solid lines: induction.'
