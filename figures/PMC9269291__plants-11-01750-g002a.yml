caption: 'Pp-EE exerts influence on decreasing expressions of mRNA and transcription
  factor. (A) Changes in mRNA expression level in RAW264.7 cells induced stimulation
  through LPS after pretreatment of Pp-EE (0–150 μg/mL). (B) Cytotoxicity of Pp-EE
  for HEK293T cells with indicated concentrations of Pp-EE for 12 h. (C,D) The effect
  of Pp-EE (0–150 μg/mL) on the activation of transcription factor (NF-κB or AP-1).
  HEK293T cells were co-transfected with an NF-κB or AP-1 luciferase construct and
  β-gal plasmid for control with or without MyD88 (left panel) or TRIF (right panel).
  (E) The total and phosphorylated levels of p50, p65, and β-actin analyzed by immunoblotting
  assay. LPS (1 μg/mL)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells with or without Pg-EE (150 μg/mL)
  were prepared. ###: p < 0.001 compared to the normal group, *: p < 0.05, **: p <
  0.01, and ***: p < 0.001 compared to the control group. −: no treatment and +: treatment.'
