caption: 'The level of Th22 cells in PBMCs is positively correlated with the pathological
  stage, lymph node metastasis, and clinical tumor biomarkers in lung cancer. (a)
  The relationship between Th22 cells in PBMCs and TNM stage (version 8) is shown.
  (b) The relationship between Th22 cells in PBMCs and metastasis is shown. The degree
  of lymph node metastasis was determined according to the 8th TNM classification.
  (c) The correlation between Th22 cells and serum CEA in adenocarcinoma (AC) patients.
  (d) The correlation between Th22 cells and serum CYFRA21-1 in squamous cell carcinoma
  (SCC) patients. The results were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). n:
  controls, 10; stage I, 10; stage II, 10; stage III, 6; stage IV, 5; ∗∗P < 0.01,
  compared to the previous group.'
