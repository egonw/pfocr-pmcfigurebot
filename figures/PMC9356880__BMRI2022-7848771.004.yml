caption: PPI network and univariate Cox analysis for the 23 DEGs in the cell cycle
  pathway (a). The PPI network consisted of 23 nodes (genes) and 240 edges (interactions
  between genes) (b). Histogram of the connectivity degrees of genes in the PPI network
  (c). Univariate Cox analysis for the 23 DEGs. A pâ€‰value < 0.001 was utilized as
  the cutoff criterion (d). Venn diagram indicating 3 common genes which overlapped
  the 12 leading genes in the PPI network and the 5 prognosis-related genes in the
  Cox analysis.
