caption: Heat map of the top 55 down-regulated metabolites. Pathway analysis for petals
  vs. stigmas. One metabolic pathway was represented by one rectangular in the diagram.
  The sizes indicate the influencing factor of the pathway in the topology analysis,
  with a larger size showing a larger degree of the influencing factor. The colors
  represent the p values (negative natural logarithm, âˆ’ln(p)) of the enrichment analysis,
  with darker colors showing a higher degree of enrichment.
