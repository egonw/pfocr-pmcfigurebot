figure_title: Identification of clade-specific genotypic and phenotypic traits within
  the Enterococcus genus phylogeny
caption: A) Frequency of a LanC ortholog (LanC-like) as well as 17 distinct lanthipeptide
  synthesis clusters () for Clade I species, non-Clade I Enterococcus (other spp.),
  and E. faecalis. The distribution of these orthologs and gene clusters is noted
  for individual members of Clade I as a heat map. The taxonomic relatedness of Clade
  I species is displayed as a pruned phylogenetic tree above the heatmap. The heatmap
  shows the relative abundance in E. faecalis, all Clade I species or all other Enterococcus
  spp. B) Enrichment of complete aerobic and anaerobic cobalamin biosynthesis pathways
  in a subset of Clade III species. C) Growth curves for a selection of isolates and
  species in a minimal media lacking Vitamin B12 (upper chart). For species lacking
  the cobalamin biosynthesis pathway, growth is rescued when 10 pg/mL of cyanocobalamin
  (CN-Cbl) is added exogenously (lower chart). D) Enrichment of flagellar biosynthesis
  gene clusters in subset of Clade IV species. Presence (black) and absence (grey)
  of specific genes is indicated for each Clade IV species (displayed as a pruned
  phylogenetic tree) as well as a heatmap showing their prevalence in all Clade IV
  species, all other Enterococcus spp., or a set of 12 Vagococcus spp. E) Depletion
  of near-complete pathways for the biosynthesis of histidine and BCAA in Clade II
  species together with E. faecalis (red arrows) or in E. faecalis alone (orange)
  compared to other Enterococcus spp. When available, the E.C. number of the missing
  enzyme is indicated.
