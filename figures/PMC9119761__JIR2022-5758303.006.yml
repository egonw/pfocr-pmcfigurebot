caption: 'Effect of LBAG on the cell injury of H/R model in H9c2 cells. (a) Cell morphology
  of H/R-induced H9c2 cells treated with LBAG was photoed by optical microscopy. (b)
  Cell viability of the H/R injury model treated with LBAG was assessed by CCK-8 assay.
  (c, d) The LDH and CK-MB levels in the culture supernatant of H/R-injured H9c2 cells
  were detected using ELISA. ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. control group. ▲P < 0.05
  and ▲▲P < 0.01 vs. H/R group. #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01 vs. 10 μmol/L LBAG group.'
