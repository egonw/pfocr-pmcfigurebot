caption: 'Transcriptomic analysis of the maternal heart during pregnancy and postpartum.
  Analyses of transcriptional changes in hearts extracted from nonpregnant, diestrus
  (NP), midpregnant (MP; day 8 of pregnancy), late pregnant (LP; day 16 of pregnancy),
  and 1 wk postbirth (PB) female mice (n = 3–5 per group). A: principal component
  analysis (PCA) was performed to examine group separation during analysis of differentially
  expressed genes. B: heatmap showing the top 75 differentially expressed transcripts
  in hearts from NP, MP, LP, and PB female mice. C: analysis showing partial least
  squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) highlighting group separation based on differentially
  expressed transcripts. D: the variable importance in projection plot (VIP) of the
  top 25 transcripts contributing to the group separation observed in the PLS-DA plot.
  E–I: counts per million (CPM) values for transcript expression of Pdk4 (E), Ogdhl1
  (F), Bdh1 (G), Acer2 (H), and Acot2 (I). ANOVA analysis was performed to identify
  significantly expressed cardiac metabolite and transcript abundances [P <0.05; false
  discovery rate (FDR) 0.05] across all time points (NP, MP, LP, and PB). Human Metabolome
  Database (HMDB) and official gene names of those significantly expressed targets
  were added to the joint pathway analysis tool in Metaboanalyst 5.0. J and K: joint
  pathway analysis was performed with Fisher’s exact test with degree centrality topology
  applied and these data integrated based on pathway level combined P values for all
  pathways (J) and metabolic pathways (K). *P < 0.05, **P <0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P
  < 0.0001, ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test.'
