caption: Protein–protein interactions by STITCH. The interactive networks of 17 proteins
  in the TGF-β signaling pathway and their predicted association with proteins in
  melanogenesis. The red dashed line circles indicate the proteins in the TGF-β pathway,
  which directly interact with the melanogenesis proteins. The blue dashed line circles
  depict the proteins in melanogenesis from the proteomics dataset.
