caption: Inside-out signaling cascade in neutrophils induced by selectin–ligand binding.
  Selectin-binding to P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) on the neutrophil
  surface, elicits a specific intracellular signaling pathway resulting in affinity
  activation of lymphocyte-function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1). Downstream of selectin-PSGL-1-ligation,
  several signaling molecules including kinases, adapter proteins, and GTPases are
  activated. The complex signaling machinery results in conformational changes of
  LFA-1 from a bent conformation with low ligand binding affinity to an extended conformation
  with intermediate ligand binding affinity. Extended LFA-1 is able to bind ICAM-1
  on the endothelial surface, promoting the transition from neutrophil rolling to
  slow rolling.
