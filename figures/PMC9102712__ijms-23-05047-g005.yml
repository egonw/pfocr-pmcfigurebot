caption: Effects of HPH-15 on a Smad-independent pathway in TGF-β signaling. (A) Protein
  levels of phosphorylated Akt and ERK in TGF-β-stimulated A549 cells treated with
  HPH-15. After incubating the cells for 1 d in the presence of HPH-15 (10 μM) and
  TGF-β (10 ng/mL), the cells were lysed. The lysate was analyzed by immunoblotting.
  (B) Quantification of the phosphorylation levels of Akt and ERK. The intensity of
  the bands in (A) was quantified using ImageJ. Relative values (band intensity of
  phosphorylated protein and that of unphosphorylated protein) are shown as values
  of “Relative phosphorylation of protein.” *** p < 0.001 compared with samples treated
  with TGF-β and without HPH-15.
