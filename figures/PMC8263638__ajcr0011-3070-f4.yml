caption: Association of six cell proliferation-related scores and patient survival
  in pancreatic cancer. Forest plots of hazard ratio (HR) for high cell proliferation-related
  pathway score in the TCGA (n = 176), GSE57495 (n = 63), and GSE62452 (n = 69). The
  median value was used as a cut-off to divide low and high groups within the cohort.
  The blue line indicates non-significance and the red line indicated significance.
  G2M, G2M Checkpoint; E2F, E2F Targets; MYC1, MYC Targets V1; MYC2, MYC Targets V2;
  Mitotic, Mitotic Spindle; p53, p53 pathway.
article_title: G2M checkpoint pathway alone is associated with drug response and survival
  among cell proliferation-related pathways in pancreatic cancer.
