caption: Schematic representation of the hippocampal molecular pathways controlled
  by FAK in the 3xTg-AD mouse model. FAK regulates hippocampal signaling pathways
  leading cytoskeletal remodeling that affects neuronal morphology. FAK blocks astrocyte
  differentiation via the JAK-STAT pathway and increases Tau hyperphosphorylation
  through PI3K/AKT and RPS6 signaling cascades. FAK activates cell cycle re-entry
  which leads to neuronal cell death by controlling CDKs and p38α-MAPK, while downregulating
  the insulin signaling pathway, thereby increasing insulin resistance and leading
  to oxidative stress. “P” represents tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein; “Ser”
  represents serine phosphorylation. Arrows represent increase or decrease in expression
  or phosphorylation of specific proteins, as indicated by our antibody microarrays.
