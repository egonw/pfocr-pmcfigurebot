caption: D. dao inhibits PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. (a) The western blot images of
  p-Akt and Akt. (b) The relative protein quantification in granulation/healing tissue
  of rats on days 5, 10, and 15 after wounding. These proteins were normalized by
  GAPDH at each time point and values are expressed as relative change compared to
  IG group. Data were expressed as mean ± SD (n = 3). Significance was determined
  by ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test. ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. the IG group.
