caption: Identification of CD8+T cell hub genes and their molecular characteristics.
  (A, B) WGCNA results in the TCGA database (A) and ICGC database (B). It included
  threshold selection, dynamic shear tree merging similar module genes and correlation
  analysis between module feature genes and CD8+T cells. (C) Venn diagram of CD8+T
  cell hub genes. (D) GO enrichment and KEGG pathway enrichment of the CD8+T cell
  hub genes. (E) PPI network construction of CD8+T cell hub gene. The PPI network
  was constructed by selecting the top 20 genes according to the MCC score. The redder
  the color, the more important the gene was.
