caption: The expression level of hsa_circ_0000847/miR-135a in liver cancer cells.
  (a and b) Elevated expression of hsa_circ_0000847 and decreased expression of miR-135a
  in liver cancer cell lines (n = 3, mean ± SD, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001
  vs LO2 cells). (c and d) Elevated expression of hsa_circ_0000847 and decreased level
  of miR-135a in HBV-positive liver cancer specimens (n = 10, mean ± SD, ∗p < 0.05,
  ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001 vs HBV-negative liver cancer specimens).

  Pathway.
