caption: 'Mifepristone activates the HRI kinase pathway. (A): Mouse embryonic fibroblast
  generated from PERK knockout mice (PERK-KO-DR) and mouse embryonic fibroblast generated
  from GCN2 knockout mice (GCN2-KO-DR) were incubated with 20 µM of mifepristone for
  6 and 12 h. Vehicle (V) and TN (2 μM-Tunicamycin) treatments were performed for
  12 h and lysates were probed with indicated antibodies. β-actin was used as loading
  control. (B): RMG1 cells were transiently transfected with scrambled (Scr) and small
  interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting HRI (si-HRI) and PKR (si-PKR) for 48 h followed
  by treatment of 20 µM of mifepristone for 6 and 10 h. Protein lysates were then
  subjected to immunoblotting with indicated antibodies. β-actin was used as loading
  control. All experiments were performed in at least two biological replicates. Uncropped
  immunoblots can be found in .'
