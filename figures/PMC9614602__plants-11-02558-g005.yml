caption: Validation of three differentially expressed known miRNAs, (A) osa-miR166c-3p,
  (B) osa-miR2102-3p, and (C) osa-miR530-3p through miRNA-specific qRT-PCR, identified
  from an miRNA sequencing results of Swarnaprabha and IR8 after low light treatment
  as compared to control. Each miRNA was amplified using mRQ 3′primer along with miRNA-specific
  and U6-specific 5′ primers. The primer sequences have been provided in . (# = miRNA-seq).
  Error bars are ±SD of the average of three miRNA-specific qRT-PCR replicates.
