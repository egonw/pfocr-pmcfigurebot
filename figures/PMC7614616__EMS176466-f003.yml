caption: Differential expression profile of genes between control cells and cells
  treated with helical magnetic nanomotors (NMs) shown as A) Volcano plot, and B)
  Heat map. C) The top five up-regulated (red) and downregulated (green) genes from
  the KEGG pathway analysis- (i) phagosomal pathways; (ii) platelet activation; (iii)
  PI3K-Akt signalling; (iv) NF-ÎºB signalling; (v) cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction;
  (vi) steroid biosynthesis, and (vii) Rap1 signalling. (For interpretation of the
  references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version
  of this article.)
