caption: Macrophages with dysregulated CMPK2 are metabolically similar to activated
  M1 macrophages with higher glycolytic flux. (A) The expression patterns of genes
  specific to M1 and M2 activated macrophages in the CMPK2 dysregulated macrophages
  KD and OE are represented as heat maps. The values represent log2 fold change from
  the corresponding control cells. (B) Continual estimation of oxygen consumption
  in NT, KD, and VC, OE macrophages until 3 h with Oroboros oxygraph. The level of
  oxygen consumption was calculated, and mean OCR ± SEM of N = 3 experiments is shown.
  (C) Metabolite levels in the CMPK2 silenced (KD) and overexpression (OE) and their
  respective control macrophages were assayed from cellular extracts by MS. The levels
  of individual metabolites in the KD and OE macrophages are represented as relative
  abundance compared to control cells as mean ± SEM from three independent experiments
  (N = 3). Expression of genes involved in the glycolysis and serine-to-glycine biosynthetic
  pathway estimated by qRT-PCR is also shown. (D) Expression of IL1β and TNFα in THP1
  cells treated with the serine biosynthesis inhibitor NCT-503 and its inactive form
  PHGDH-inactive. Expression values are mean fold change in expression with respect
  to GAPDH ± SEM triplicate assays of N = 3 experiments after 6 h of treatment. *p<0.05,
  **p<0.01, ***p<0.001.
