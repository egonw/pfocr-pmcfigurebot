caption: The cell proliferation and cellular uptake of selected LDH nanoparticles
  in hUC-MSCs. A) CCK8 analysis of MgAl–Cl and MgFe–NO3 LDH treated hUC-MSCs for 1
  day and 3 days under different concentrations (1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 μg/mL).
  *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001. B) Flow cytometry analysis of cellular uptake of MgAl–Cl
  and MgFe–NO3 LDH in hUC-MSCs after different time incubation (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8,
  24 and 48 h). C) Metal ion release of MgAl–Cl LDH and MgFe–NO3 LDH in PBS after
  different time. D) Immunofluoresence of cellular uptake of MgAl–Cl and MgFe–NO3
  LDH conjugated with FITC in hUC-MSCs after 24 h incubation, the organelle was labeled
  with mito-red (mitochondrial labeling, up) and lyso-red (lysosome labeling, down),
  respectively. Scale bar = 10 μm. E) Mitochondrial membrane potential of MgAl–Cl
  LDH and MgFe–NO3 LDH treated hUC-MSCs for 1 day and 3 days. Scale bar = 100 μm.
