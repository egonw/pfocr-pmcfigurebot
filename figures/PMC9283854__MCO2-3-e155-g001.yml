caption: 'Overview of DNA damage repair mechanisms. DNA damage repair systems can
  be classified into two main groups: DNA double‐strand break (DSB) repair and single‐strand
  break (SSB) repair. Generally, DSBs are repaired by nonhomologous end‐joining (NHEJ)
  or homology‐directed repair (HDR). SSBs are repaired by nucleotide excision repair
  (NER) or base excision repair (BER). In the NHEJ pathway, DNA damage can be recognized
  by the Ku70/Ku80 complex and repaired by subsequent nucleases and ligases. The HDR
  pathway can achieve effective lesion repair using template‐directed DNA. The NER
  contains two signaling pathways, global genomic NER (GG‐NER) and transcription‐coupled
  NER (TC‐NER). GG‐NER used the heterotrimeric lesion recognition factor (consisting
  of XPC, RAD23, and CETN2) to detect DNA lesions, but TC‐NER used RNA polymerase
  II (RNAPII), Cockayne syndrome A (CSA) and CSB protein. The BER pathway is responsible
  for resolving nonbulky single‐base lesions. Gene editing agents use these pathways
  to achieve genetic modification'
