caption: Functional enrichment analysis of E16 in Ujumqin and Hulunbuir sheep. (A)
  KEGG showing signaling pathways activated in the notochord of Ujumqin sheep. These
  pathways included the TGF-beta signaling pathway, Hippo signaling pathway, platelet
  activation pathway, riboflavin metabolism pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, regulation
  of actin cytoskeleton, and insulin signaling pathway. (B) KEGG showing signaling
  pathways activated in the spinal cord in Ujumqin sheep. These pathways included
  glutathione metabolism, dicarboxylate metabolism, the citrate cycle (TCA cycle),
  thyroid hormone synthesis, pyruvate metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism,
  thermogenesis, and VEGF signaling pathway. (C) KEGG showing signaling pathways activated
  in the paraxial mesoderm in Ujumqin sheep. These pathways included steroid biosynthesis,
  riboflavin metabolism, the cell cycle, the Hippo signaling pathway, the Hedgehog
  signaling pathway, the FoxO signaling pathway, the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and
  the Wnt signaling pathway. (D) IGFBP5 and FST expression detection. (E) AHSG and
  AFP expression detection. (F) HOXB9 expression detection. (G) Selected DEGs were
  confirmed using qRT-PCR (** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001).
