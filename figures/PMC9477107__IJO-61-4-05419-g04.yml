caption: LIS1 enhances tumor metastasis in a SACC metastasis nude mouse model. For
  the metastatic models, 5×106 cells in 100 µl PBS were injected into the nude mice
  via the tail vein (n=5 per group). (A) Kaplan-Meier survival curve of the mice after
  injection of LIS1 overexpression or knockdown SACC cells via the tail vein. (B)
  The Living Image system was used to observe metastasis 30 days after intravenous
  injection of tumor cells. (C) Representative images of the lungs isolated from metastatic
  nude mice. (D) The lungs from SACC-LM metastatic model mice were stained with H&E,
  and immunohistochemical staining to detect Pan-CK was performed. Scale bar, 500
  µm. (E) Quantitative analysis of the percentage of tumor area in the whole lung
  tissue according to immunohistochemical staining of Pan-CK. (F) The expression levels
  of MMP2, MMP9, and MMP14 in the lungs of the SACC-LM metastatic model mice were
  detected by immunohistochemical staining. (G) Quantitative analysis of immunohistochemical
  staining of MMPs. Scale bar, 100 µm. Mean ± SEM; **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001. LIS1,
  lissencephaly 1; SACC, salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinoma; PBS, phosphate-buffered
  saline; H&E, hematoxylin and eosin; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; sh-, short hairpin
  RNA.
