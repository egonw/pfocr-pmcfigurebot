caption: Schematic diagram of the regulatory mechanism for the serum LPA-promoted
  AJC organization. Major AJC components are shown. Major AJ CAMs, E-cadherin and
  nectin-2, bind the β-catenin−αE-catenin complex and afadin, respectively. Major
  TJ CAM claudin-3 binds ZO-1. The present study revealed that serum LPA has an AJC
  organization–promoting activity, and that serum LPA has a TJ formation–promoting
  activity in a manner independent of the AJ components. These serum LPA activities
  are mediated through LPAR1/5 via the DAG–nPKC and Rho–ROCK pathway activation. AJ,
  adherens junction; AJC, apical junctional complex; CAM, cell adhesion molecule;
  DAG, diacylglycerol; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; LPAR, lysophosphatidic acid receptor;
  nPKC, novel PKC; TJ, tight junction.
