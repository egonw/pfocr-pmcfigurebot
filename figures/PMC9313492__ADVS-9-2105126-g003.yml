caption: ACSL4‐activated FAO mediates HK2‐regulated liver CSC stemness. a) Western
  blots measuring CD13, EpCAM, and ALDH1A1 protein levels in HUH7 cells treated with
  DMSO or 10 × 10−6m ETOM. ACTIN was detected as a loading control. b) Tumorsphere
  formation assay of HUH7 (left) and C3A (right) cells after HK2 overexpression and
  treatment with 10 × 10−6m ETOM. Additionally, see the photographs in Figure  (Supporting
  Information). Data are represented as the mean ± SD (n = 2). One‐way ANOVA with
  multiple comparisons correction. c) Fuel dependency of HUH7 cells treated with BPTES
  (3 × 10−6m), ETOM (4 × 10−6m), and UK5099 (2 × 10−6m). The graph shows the fraction
  of the OCR decrease induced by the inhibitors relative to the control. Box and whisker
  plots, n = 13 wells per condition, one‐way ANOVA with multiple comparisons correction.
  d) Time series of OCR measurements in HUH7 cells treated with pLVTHM BSA, pLVTHM
  PALM (palmitate), pLVTHM BSA ETOM, shHK2 BSA and shHK2 PALM, and shHK2 BSA ETOM
  by a Seahorse Metabolic Analyzer. Data are represented as the mean ± SD, n = 7–8
  wells per condition. e) The (d) basal respiration rates of all groups. n = 7–8 wells
  per condition. One‐way ANOVA with multiple comparisons correction. f) The (d) mitochondrial
  ATP production rates (oligomycin‐sensitive respiration) of all groups. n = 7–8 wells
  per condition. One‐way ANOVA with multiple comparisons correction. g) Time series
  of OCR measurements in HUH7 cells after HK2 overexpression and ACSL4 knockdown by
  Seahorse Metabolic Analyzer. Data are represented as the mean ± SD, n = 6–8 wells
  per condition. h) Time series of OCR measurements in HUH7 cells after HK2 overexpression
  and RTZ treatment by a Seahorse Metabolic Analyzer. Data are represented as the
  mean ± SD, n = 6–8 wells per condition. i) Time series of OCR measurements in HUH7
  cells after transfection with HK2 knockdown and ACSL4 overexpression by a Seahorse
  Metabolic Analyzer. Data are represented as the mean ± SD, n = 7–8 wells per condition.
