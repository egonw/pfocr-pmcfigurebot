caption: a. CRNDE mediated the important PI3K/Akt signaling pathway to promote the
  development of gastric cancer. The high expression level of CRNDE can bind to SRSF6
  to reduce its protein stability, hence regulating its downstream target PICALM to
  affect the chemosensitivity of GC cells. b. CRNDE acts as an oncogenic lncRNA to
  significantly enhance the development of prostate cancer through negatively modulating
  miR-146a-5p and miR-101/Rap1A axis. Created with BioRender.com.
