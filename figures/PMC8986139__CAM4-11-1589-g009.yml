caption: Regulation of malignant characteristics of NSCLC cells by RNASEH1‐AS1 is
  dependent on miR‐516a‐5p. (A) MiR‐516a‐5p level in miR‐516a‐5p inhibitor‐transfected
  NSCLC cells. (B–D) si‐RNASEH1‐AS1 alongside the miR‐516a‐5p/NC inhibitor was transfected
  into H522 cells, while SK‐MES‐1 cells overexpressing RNASEH1‐AS1 were transfected
  with miR‐516a‐5p/NC mimic. Cell growth and apoptosis were assessed in the different
  groups. (E, F) The motility of the abovementioned cells was examined (×200 magnification).

article_title: Long noncoding RNASEH1‐AS1 exacerbates the progression of non‐small
  cell lung cancer by acting as a ceRNA to regulate microRNA‐516a‐5p/FOXK1 and thereby
  activating the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway.
