caption: 'cAMP reduction caused pyruvate-stimulated FGF21 expression in HepG2 cells.
  (A): The activation of PPAR-α and AMPK was not involved in pyruvate-stimulated FGF21
  expression (** p < 0.01 vs. control, n = 3). (B): AC activator forskolin, PDE inhibitor
  IBMX and 8-Bromo-cAMP administration significantly inhibited FGF21 expression and
  suppressed pyruvate-stimulated FGF21 expression (* p < 0.05 vs. control, # p < 0.05
  vs. pyruvate group, n = 3). (C): Forskolin, IBMX and 8-Bromo-cAMP inhibited pyruvate-stimulated
  increase in FGF21 protein levels in cell medium (* p < 0.05 vs. control, # p < 0.05
  vs. pyruvate group, n = 10). (D): Pyruvate decreased intracellular cAMP levels in
  HepG2 cells (** p < 0.01 vs. control, n = 12).'
