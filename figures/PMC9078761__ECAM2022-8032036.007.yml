caption: Putative schematic model of pharmacological mechanisms of SQYG ameliorating
  cognitive impairment of AD. The predominant protein targets of SQYG were related
  to regulating multiple AD pathophysiological processes, principally involving glutamatergic
  synapse, calcium signaling pathway, mitochondrial dysfunction, reduction of misfolded
  proteins, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, and apoptosis pathway. Molecular
  docking focused on the 3 representative compounds and 3 prime targets in AD pathogenesis.
  These active therapeutic targets and involved biological processes of SQYG ultimately
  improve cognitive function.
