caption: UBE2C controls the expression of MMP-2/7/9 via the activation of the PI3K-Akt
  pathway. (A) EMT marker expression; (B) MMP-2, MMP-7, and MMP-9 expression was measured,
  with GAPDH as a loading control; (C) Western blotting was used to detect Akt and
  p-Akt expression, with GAPDH as a loading control; (D) the kinase activity of PI3K
  was analyzed in the indicated cell lines; (E) PTEN expression was assessed via Western
  blotting. ***, P<0.001. UBE2C, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2C; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase;
  EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition.
article_title: UBE2C promotes the progression of pancreatic cancer and glycolytic
  activity via EGFR stabilization-mediated PI3K-Akt pathway activation.
