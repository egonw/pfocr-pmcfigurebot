caption: Target genes in modules of DGWI network are involved in cancer pathways and
  PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. (a) Drug targets and cancer driver genes in cluster
  1; (b) Genes in cluster 1 are involved in human cancer pathway. (c) Drug targets
  and cancer driver genes in cluster 2; (d) Genes in cluster 2 are involved in PI3K-AKT
  signaling pathway. Drugs and gene are marked with diamonds and circles, orange circles
  represent drug targets. Cancer driver genes are marked by rectangles. Protein coding
  products of genes in clusters are marked by pink rectangles in pathways. (A color
  version of this figure is available in the online journal.)
