caption: Overview of cellular signaling mediated by 4E-BP1 (4E binding protein 1).
  The 4E-BP1 protein is encoded by the gene EIF4EBP1 (eukaryotic translation initiation
  factor 4EBP1). 4E-BP1 directly interacts with the eukaryotic translation factor
  4E (4E), which prevents completion of a multisubunit scaffold that aids in the recruitment
  of 40S ribosomal subunits to the 5â€™ end of mRNA. In response to mTOR (mammalian
  target of rapamycin) signaling following activation of the PI3K pathway (phosphoinositide
  3-kinase)/AKT pathway, the mTORC1 complex will phosphorylate 4E-BP1. The enables
  the release of 4E, which is now free to complete the multisubunit scaffold necessary
  to activate cap-dependent translation of mRNA. Ultimately, this facilitates a broad
  range of downstream effects resulting in cell cycling and tumorigenesis.

  cell proliferation and is a biomarker for poor breast cancer prognosis.
