figure_title: Individual gene and pathway changes during adaptation to cyclin E overproduction
caption: (A) Heat map of down-regulated pathways in the indicated pairwise comparisons
  using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis shaded by P-value. Statistically significant
  pathway changes defined by nominal P-value score <0.05 are black with an “S” (light
  yellow boxes indicate no data). (B) Heat map of up-regulated pathways in the indicated
  pairwise comparisons using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis shaded by P-value. Statistically
  significant pathway changes are highlighted (black) with an “S” (light yellow boxes
  indicate no data). (C) Volcano plot of all detected mRNAs comparing control versus
  proliferative crisis (day 0 versus ∼days 9–12 after induction); statistically significant
  up-regulated (red) or down-regulated genes (blue). Gene expression changes below
  the threshold for significance are gray. (D) As in (C) comparing control with recovered
  cells after doxycycline withdrawal; selected origin licensing and DNA damage response
  genes are highlighted. See also Table S1.
