caption: 'circCCT3 and miR-107 regulated the Wnt signaling pathway and FGF7. (a) TargetScan
  predicted Wnt3a as the potential target for miR-107. (b, d) RT-qPCR showed Wnt3a
  and FGF7 levels in A549 cells transiently transfected with the NC mimic, miR-107
  mimic, NC inhibitor, and miR-107 inhibitor. ∗∗∗P < 0.001, miR-107 mimic vs NC mimic
  group; ###P < 0.001, miR-107 inhibitor vs NC inhibitor group. (c, e) Wnt3a and FGF7
  levels were measured by RT-qPCR in A549 cells stably transfected with sh-NC, sh-circCCT3-1,
  and sh-circCCT3-2. ∗∗∗P < 0.001, sh-circCCT3-1 vs sh-NC group, and sh-circCCT3-2
  vs sh-NC group.'
