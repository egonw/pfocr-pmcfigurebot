caption: 'PPAR/DNMT3A pathway mediates the inhibition of inflammatory molecule synthesis
  by galangin in rat monocytes. (a) The WB assay results of PPAR and DNMT3A contents
  in BALF monocyte nuclei for various groups. (b, c) The relative levels of PPAR and
  DNMT3A expression, respectively. (d) The WB assay results of p65 and AP-1 levels
  in BALF monocyte nuclei. (e) The relative levels of p65 and AP-1 expression. In
  all the abovementioned analyses, β-actin is used as the internal control. (g, i)
  The blue parts present the CpG islands located in the promoter regions of rat IL-6
  and TNF-a, respectively. There are binding sites for corresponding TFs within the
  aforementioned CpG islands, and the Chip-qPCR amplification regions are also located
  in these islands. (h) The Chip-qPCR results of phosphorylated p65 bound to the CpG
  island in the IL-6 promoter, where the relative density of bands in the upper gel
  electrophoresis map represents the semiquantitative PCR result. As is clear, the
  size of the amplification region at the IL-6 promoter site is 275 bp, and the reference
  sequence is the second intron region of IL-6, which has a size of 158 bp. Meanwhile,
  the bar graph describes the relative binding capacity of p65 that was analyzed by
  AlphaEase FC version 4. (j) The Chip-qPCR results shows AP-1 binding to the CpG
  island in the TNF-a promoter, where the amplification region has a size of 338 bp.
  The bar graph describes the relative binding capacity of AP-1, and the reference
  sequence is the same as that used in the IL-6 assay. ∗P < 0.05 versus Sham group;
  ∗∗P < 0.05 versus LPS group; #P < 0.05 versus LPS + GAL group; ##P < 0.05 versus
  LPS + GAL and LPS + GAL + GW9662 groups.'
