caption: 'pIC priming enhances antiviral and immunomodulatory transcriptomic profile
  of MSCs(A) Volcano plot shows differentially expressed genes (log2 fold change >1
  or < −1 and adjusted p value <0.05) with 794 genes upregulated (red) and 195 downregulated
  (blue); NS: nonsignificant change (gray). Each dot represents one gene.(B) Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis of the differential expressed genes dataset showed the most significant
  canonical pathways, molecules, diseases, and functions. Blue icon: negative Z score
  (predicts inhibition); orange icons: positive Z score (predict activation).(C) Relevant
  Gene Ontology terms for the top 50 upregulated (red) and downregulated (blue) genes
  in pIC-MSCs compared with unprimed MSCs.(D) Heatmaps of unsupervised clustering
  show gene expression (normalized counts) of Ctrl-MSCs and pIC-MSCs, illustrating
  the variation of genes (each row) annotated for immune or antiviral response. Each
  column represents MSCs derived from one bone marrow donor, with a total of three
  donors.(E) Protein-protein interaction network shows top 25 upregulated protein-coding
  genes in pIC-MSCs (cluster [k-means] numbers estimated to 3). The thickness of the
  network edge line indicates the strength of publicly available data that support
  the specific interaction, with the thicker line indicating stronger evidence support.(F)
  Heatmap showing upregulated genes in pIC-MSCs coded for secreted antiviral proteins.
  For RNA-seq, n = 3 biological replicates.'
