figure_title: ZNF276 activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling through recruitment of MAGEB2
  to regulate CYP1B1 transcription
caption: A GO analysis of the potential ZNF276-interacted proteins. B KEGG analysis
  of the potential ZNF276-interacted proteins. C, D Both forward (C) and reverse (D)
  co-IP analysis affirmed the interaction between ZNF276 and MAGEB2. E ChIP-PCR analysis
  of ZNF276 binding ability at the CYP1B1 promoter affected by MAGEB2 overexpression.
  F, G The luciferase activity of CYP1B1 promoter decreased by ZNF276 silencing was
  further enhanced by the expression of MAGEB2 in 293T and MCF-7. H, I RT-qPCR (H)
  and western blot (I) analysis confirmed the effect of MAGEB2 overexpression in CYP1B1
  mRNA and protein expression in MCF-7 cells. J, K The reduced transcriptional activity
  of CYP1B1 promoter by ZNF276 was partially reversed by MAGEB2. L, M Overexpression
  of MAGEB2 reversed the decreased cell proliferation, migration and invasion abilities
  affected by ZNF276 silencing in CCK-8 assay (L), transwell migration (M, up) and
  transwell invasion (M, down).
