caption: The in situ IVD regeneration function of optimizing LDH pretreated hUC-MSCs
  for 7 days chondrogenic differentiation and transplantation in the injury site of
  rat model. A) The schematic diagram of IDD model constructed by needle puncture.
  B) The photo records of surgical model construction. C) X-ray analysis of IVD height
  change with different treatment after 4 weeks. D) X-ray analysis after 8 weeks.
  E) MRI analysis after 8 weeks. F) MRI analysis after 12 weeks. G) The disc height
  index (DHI) of optimizing LDH-pretreated cell transplantation effects 4 weeks and
  8 weeks after surgery. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. H) H&E and S&O staining
  of different treatment after 12 weeks. I) Immunofluorescent of COL1A1, COL2A1 and
  Ki67 staining of different treatment after 12 weeks. White arrows indicate positive
  cells. Scale bar = 100 μm. J) Tissue H&E staining of main organs including heart,
  liver, spleen, lung and kidney in Sham, Control, Cell and LDH groups after 12 weeks
  operation. Scale bar = 500 μm.
