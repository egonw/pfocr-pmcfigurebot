caption: '(A) The average pupil constriction in response to 1-lux light (475 R*/rod/s)
  beginning at t = 0 s for control (blue, n = 9), Elfn1 KO (magenta, n = 11), Cone-Cx36
  KO (cyan, n = 5), and Elfn1; Cx36 dKO (red, n = 6) mice. Shaded outlines represent
  SEM. All pupil sizes are normalized to the dark-adapted pupil size (before t = 0).(B)
  The minimum pupil area (maximal constriction) in response to 1-lux light from t
  = 0 to t = 30 s. Individuals and SEM are shown. Significance from the control group
  is as follows: Elfn1 KO, p = 1.3E–4; Cone-Cx36 KO, p = 1; Elfn1; Cx36 dKO, p = 2.7E–6
  (ANOVA post hoc Dunnett’s method).(C) The same as (A) but a 0.1-lux light (73 R*/rod/sec)
  stimulus was used.(D) The minimum pupil area (maximal constriction) in response
  to 0.1-lux light from t = 0 to t = 30 s. Individuals and SEM are shown. Significance
  from the control group (blue, n = 16) is as follows: Elfn1 KO (magenta, n = 12),
  p = 0.008; Cone-Cx36 KO (cyan, n = 4), p = 0.98 (ANOVA post hoc Dunnett’s method).'
