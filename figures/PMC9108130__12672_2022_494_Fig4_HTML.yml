caption: KLF14 promotes cervical cancer cell apoptosis. A Flow cytometry was performed
  to detect apoptosis, and the results showed that the apoptosis rate of SiHa cells
  in the Lv-KLF14 group was higher than that of SiHa cells in the Lv-control group.
  B The apoptosis rate of HeLa cells in the Lv-KLF14 group was higher than that of
  HeLa cells in the Lv-control group. C Quantitative statistics of the apoptosis rate
  of SiHa cells and HeLa cells. (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01)
article_title: KLF14 targets ITGB1 to inhibit the progression of cervical cancer via
  the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway.
