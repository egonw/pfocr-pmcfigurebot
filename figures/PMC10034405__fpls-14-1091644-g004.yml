caption: Involvement of the salicylic acid pathway during F. oxysporum infection in
  gi-100 plant infection. (A–E) Transcript expression validation using RT-qPCR and
  (F) quantitative profiling of salicylic acid amount at 24 DPI by F. oxysporum were
  done in gi-100 and Col-0 lines of A thaliana. (A) ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE 1 (ICS1),
  (B) NON-EXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES 1 (NPR1), (C) PATHOGEN RESPONSIVE
  GENE 1 (PR1), (D) TGACG SEQUENCE-SPECIFIC BINDING PROTEIN 2 (TGA2), and (E) PAD4.
  ACTIN were used to normalize transcript levels. Determination of (F) salicylic acid
  (SA) amount. For SA quantification, D4-salicylic acid was taken as standard. Values
  are presented as mean ± SE. The qRT-PCR reactions were done in triplicate from three
  biological replicates. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Sidak’s multiple
  comparisons test was performed with the help of GraphPad Prism to test for significance
  among the dataset, *p < 0.05. **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. ns, Non-significant.
