caption: SAMD1 deletion impairs the mTOR signaling pathway and sensitizes cells to
  serum starvation. (a) Expression of PIK3IP1 in wild-type, control, and SAMD1 KO
  cells, measured via RT-qPCR. Error bars indicate the SD of three biological replicates.
  * p < 0.05 (Student’s t-test) (b) GSEA of mTOR signaling and rapamycin-sensitive
  genes in SAMD1 KO cells. (c) Volcano plot of ribosomal genes comparing expression
  in control and SAMD1 KO cells. (d) Representative bright-field microscopy of SAMD1
  KO and control HepG2 cells upon serum starvation. (e) MTT viability assay of cells
  treated as in (d). Error bars indicate the SD of three biological replicates. *
  p < 0.05 (Student’s t-test). (f) Representative bright-field microscopy of SAMD1
  KO and control HepG2 cells upon serum starvation supplemented with insulin. (g)
  MTT viability assay of cells treated as in (f). Error bars indicate the SD of three
  biological replicates. * p < 0.05 (Student’s t-test). (h) Model of SAMD1’s influence
  on the mTOR signaling pathway. In (a,d–g) the “#” refers to two distinct SAMD1 KO
  clones.
