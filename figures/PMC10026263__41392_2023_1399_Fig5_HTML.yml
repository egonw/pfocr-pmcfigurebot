caption: Potential roles and applications of small-molecule candidate metabolites
  for biomarker discovery, diseases diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatments
  in biomedicine. Compound detection, metabolites are detected by using specific detection
  techniques; data pre-processing, raw signals are then pre-processed to produce data
  in a suitable format for subsequent statistical analysis; then, data normalization
  is used to reduce the system and technical bias; data processing, for untargeted
  studies, metabolites are identified from spectral information in some given database;
  statistical analyses, univariate and multivariate statistical analyses are used
  to identify significantly expressed metabolites; biomarker discovery from multicenter,
  the discriminant metabolites originated from metabolomics approaches may become
  promising candidate molecules to aid disease diagnosis, and risk stratification;
  function analyses, next, the significantly expressed metabolites are subsequently
  linked to the biological context by using enrichment and pathway analysis. The images
  were obtained using the example data provided by the MetaboAnalyst 5.0 and figures
  created by BioRender
