caption: 'An increased intracellular Ca2+ level is required for CDCQ-induced eNOS
  phosphorylation at Ser1177. a Intracellular Ca2+ level was assayed using the fluorescent
  calcium indicator, Fluo-4-AM. Fluo-4-AM-treated cells were stimulated with 5–20 µM
  CDCQ for 5 min. b Cells were pretreated with 50 μM 2-ABP (IP3 receptor inhibitor),
  50 μM tetracaine (Tetra, RyR inhibitor), or 0.5 mM EDTA for 30 min, and subsequently
  with 20 µM CDCQ for 60 min before being assessed by Western blotting. *Significantly
  different from the control at p < 0.01. #Significantly different from CDCQ-treated
  cells at p < 0.01'
