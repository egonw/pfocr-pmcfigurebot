caption: Quantitative analysis of the NLRP1b inflammasome signaling pathways determined
  by caspase-1 and GSDMD expression levels. (a) Dynamic responses of the key transducers
  in the three pathways under different caspase-1 levels after 2-, 4-, and 6-hour
  LT treatment. Each transducer is described by a corresponding variable in Table
  . The binding of one protein to another protein is quantified by measuring the amount
  of the variables that represent the protein complexes. Amount of Pro-C1_GD (Pro-caspase-1
  binding to GSDMD) is represented by the variable pC1_pGD in Tables . C1_GD, C1_ASC,
  C8_ASC, C8_C1, C9_C1, and C3_C1 correspond, respectively, to the variables of C1_pGD,
  N1b_ASC_pC1, N1b_ASC_pC8, C1_pC8, C1_pC9, and C1_pC3 in Table . (b) The proposed
  scheme of pathway transduction and cell death mode that are quantitatively determined
  by caspase-1 level. (c) Dynamic responses of the key transducers in the three pathways
  under different GSDMD levels after 2-, 4-, and 6-hour LT treatment. (d) The proposed
  scheme of pathway transduction and cell death mode that are quantitatively determined
  by GSDMD level.
