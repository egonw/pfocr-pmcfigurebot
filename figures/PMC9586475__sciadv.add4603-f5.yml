figure_title: Wnt signaling in hair follicloids
caption: (A) The number of genes up- and down-regulated because of Matrigel supplementation.
  A total of 77 genes associated with the Wnt signaling pathway were examined after
  4 days of culture. Numerical variables were statistically evaluated using Student’s
  t tests, and P < 0.05 was considered to be significant. The graph shows a comparison
  of four representative genes; *P < 0.05, n = 3. (B) Wnt10b expression levels were
  assessed using RT-PCR. Numerical variables were statistically evaluated using Student’s
  t tests; *P < 0.05, n = 3. (C) H&E and immunohistochemical staining of sectioned
  embryonic mouse skin at E15. (D) Localization of Wnt10b-positive cells in hair follicloids
  on day 4 of culture and E15 mouse skin. (E) Histological analysis of hair follicloids.
  Hair follicloids were sectioned and stained with H&E and fluorescent antibodies
  against Wnt10b. The bottom images show magnified views of the dashed box in the
  top images. Arrows indicate HFG-like structures. (F) Effects of the Wnt10b inhibitor
  on hair follicloid formation. Hair follicloids were cultured in the presence of
  XAV-939, a Wnt signaling inhibitor, for 4 days. Hair follicloids were sectioned
  and stained with H&E and fluorescent antibodies against Wnt10b.
