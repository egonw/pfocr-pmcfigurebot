caption: 'Expression of neuronal markers and Wnt-related signals. The levels of neuronal
  markers (a, b), Wnt-related proteins (c and d), and MAPK signaling (e and f) were
  determined via western blotting analysis. GAPDH was used as a control. Original
  uncut western blotting images are shown in Additional file : Figs. S4, S5, S6. All
  experiments were repeated at least three times. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001
  compared to the control group'
