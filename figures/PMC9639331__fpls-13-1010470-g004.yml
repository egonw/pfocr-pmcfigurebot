caption: (A, B) Effect of BcGRP23 knockdown on the phenotypes of flowering Chinese
  cabbage at the initial flowering stage (A) and the full-bloom stage (B). Transgenic
  lines carrying the empty pTRV2 vector (EV) were used as wild type (WT). L1–L4 represent
  pTRV2:BcGRP23. (C, D) Chlorophyll contents of the leaves (C) and petioles (D) in
  the BcGRP23 knockdown lines. L1–L7 represent different BcGRP23 knockdown lines.
  Error bars represent standard errors. Different lowercase letters indicate significant
  differences at the p < 0.05 level.
