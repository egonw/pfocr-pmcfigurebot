figure_title: ShRNA-mediated knockdown and pharmacological modulation of SARS-CoV-2
  replication
caption: '(A) IHC analysis of shRNA-mediated knockdown of YAP1 and LATS1 specific
  shRNAs showed efficiently reduced or increased SARS-CoV-2 replication (green) relative
  to shRNA control, respectively in hPSC-CMs. Scale bar 50 μm. (B) Western blot analysis
  of shRNA-mediated knockdown of YAP1 and LATS1 respective protein expression. (Con:
  Control shRNA). (C) IHC images of XMU-MP-1 (MST1/2 inhibitor) and vehicle treated
  hPSC-CMs are shown. Note: XMU-MP-1 increased SARS-CoV-2 replication (green) in hPSC-CM.
  (D) Graphs depict quantification of SARS-CoV-2 positive cells in infected hPSC-CM
  respective to panels A and C. Student T-test. **P >0.001. n=2 independent experiments.
  (E) IHC Images show YAP/TAZ protein (green) and SARS-CoV-2 Spike (red) in Calu-3cells.
  Note, MST1/2 inhibitor treated Calu-3 cells have higher number of infected cells.
  Inset and white asterisk hovers infected cells showing depletion of YAP/TAZ. Scale
  bar: 25 μm. Inset scale bar 10 μm. (F) Western blot analysis of Calu-3 cells treated
  with Verteporfin (1μM) and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Drug treatment resulted in reduction
  in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Graph shows the viral titer (TCID50/ml) measurement of
  infected as well as treated Calu-3 culture supernatant(representative data from
  two independent experiments) (G) Schematic diagram of our hypothetical model integrating
  Hippo and TBK1 signaling pathways during preinfection (Hippo off) and SARS-CoV-2
  infection states (Hippo on). c-GAS, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase; IKKe, inhibitor of
  nuclear factor kappa B kinase subunit epsilon; MAVS, mitochondrial antiviral-signaling
  protein; RIG-I, retinoic acid inducible gene I protein; STING, stimulator of interferon
  response cGAMP interactor 1; TEAD, TEA domain transcription factors.'
