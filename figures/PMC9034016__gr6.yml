caption: m6A-mediated regulation affected transcriptional machinery to modulate cs-lncRNA
  expression. (A) The enriched transcriptional regulation related biological processes
  that were significantly associated with the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway
  and disrupted by METTL14 knockout. (B) The expression changes of decreased and increased
  cs-TFs in METTL14 knockout NHDF cells compared with that of control after VACV-70mer
  (dsDNA) treatment. (C) The observed (labeled as a vertical red line) and expected
  (represented as the histogram) downregulated proportion of increased cs-TFs (left)
  and upregulated proportion of decreased cs-TFs (right) in METTL14 knockout NHDF
  cells compared with that of control after dsDNA treatment. The expected proportion
  was estimated using 1,000 permutations based on all expressed TFs. (D) The correlation
  of expression changes of cs-TFs between four cGAS-STING signaling stimulations in
  HFF-1 cells and dsDNA stimulation in METTL14 knockout NHDF cells. (E) The integrated
  heatmap depicted the m6A status of increased and decreased cs-TFs, and reversed
  expression pattern of cs-TFs in METTL14 knockout NHDF cells after dsDNA treatment.
  (F) The observed (labeled as a vertical red line) and expected (represented as the
  histogram) proportion of increased cs-TFs (left) harboring gain of m6A peaks and
  proportion of decreased cs-TFs (right) harboring loss of m6A peaks. The expected
  proportion was estimated using 1,000 permutations based on all expressed TFs. (G)
  The overlap of 17 cs-TFs with ENCODE ChIPseq binding site information and 58 TFs
  with enriched binding sites on the promoters of cs-lncRNAs. (H) The cumulative distribution
  of gene expression changes (LFC) for increased cs-lncRNAs (red), decreased cs-lncRNAs
  (blue), and all expressed lncRNAs (black) after inhibiting a cs-TF, EZH2. The y-axis
  shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of LFC distribution. (For interpretation
  of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
