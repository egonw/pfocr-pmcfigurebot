caption: Growth regulation by PKCα and PKCδ.A, PKCα signaling predominantly inhibits
  cell cycle progression. In G1, PKCα induces cell cycle withdrawal by inhibiting
  CDK4/6 and CDK2 activity through downregulation of cyclin D and upregulation of
  p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 (). PKCα activation in S phase induces senescence as a result
  of p21Cip1 upregulation in G2/M (). In contrast, PKCδ both promotes and inhibits
  cell cycle progression. Positive effects of PKCδ on G1/S progression involve cyclin
  E upregulation and downregulation of p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 (). PKCδ can also promote
  S-phase transit () and can enhance the G2/M transition by activating CDK1 through
  phosphorylation of Cdc25b (). Conversely, PKCδ inhibits G1 progression by downregulating
  cyclin D and cyclin E and upregulating p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 (). PKCδ can also inhibit
  cell cycle progression in S phase () and G2/M (), which results in apoptosis. B,
  PKCα can inhibit proliferation by suppressing the activity of receptor tyrosine
  kinases (RTKs) () such as EGFR, and by inhibiting multiple steps in the PI3K–AKT
  pathway (). In addition, PKCα induces growth-inhibitory ERK signaling () that is
  dominant over growth-promoting signals. In contrast, PKCδ promotes proliferation
  and survival through positive regulation of receptor and non-RTKs () and G protein–coupled
  receptors (GPCRs) () and by promoting oncogenic ERK signaling downstream of mutant
  K-Ras (). CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor;
  ERK, extracellular signal–regulated kinase.
