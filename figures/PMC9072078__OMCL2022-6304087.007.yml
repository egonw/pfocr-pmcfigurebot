caption: 'Proposed signaling mechanism for the effects of DEAC and chemical constituents
  (CM and AMB) in LPS-induced neuroinflammation in BV-2 cells. Activation of toll-like
  receptor 4 (TLR-4) with LPS leads to activation of the NF-κB and MAPK pathways.
  The IKK complex phosphorylates IkBα, which leads to the degradation of IkBα and
  subsequent nuclear translocation of NF-κB. At the same time, the MAPK pathway (JNK
  and ERK1/2) regulates the transcription of inflammatory mediators through the activation
  of the transcription factor AP-1. Activation of NF-κB and AP-1 results in the expression
  of iNOS and the production of proinflammatory mediators. DEAC disrupts LPS-induced
  neuroinflammatory pathways, decreasing JNK and ERK1/2 signaling. DEAC and chemical
  constituents decrease the expression of iNOS, as well as the production of inflammatory
  mediators (NO and cytokines). IKK: IκB kinase complex; IκBα: kappa B inhibitor;
  P: phosphate; NF-κB: nuclear kappa factor B; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase;
  ERK: extracellular signal regulatory kinase; AP-1: activator protein 1.'
