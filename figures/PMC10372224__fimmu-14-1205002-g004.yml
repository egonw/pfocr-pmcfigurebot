caption: Model of flavivirus sNS1-induced complement evasion and hyperpermeability
  of endothelial cells. (A) Flavivirus sNS1 was shown to involve in viral immune evasion
  through interaction with complement system components. sNS1 binds to proC1s/C1s
  and C4, forming a complex to promote efficient degradation of C4 to C4a and C4b,
  thus limiting the amount of C4 available (1). sNS1 also binds and recruits the complement
  regulatory protein C4 binding protein (C4BP) to the cell surface. Once bound to
  NS1, C4BP can act as a cofactor for Factor I-mediated cleavage of C4b to C4c and
  C4d (2). In addition, DENV sNS1 binds to human mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and
  protects DENV from MBL-mediated neutralization (3). WNV sNS1 recruits the alternative
  complement pathway regulatory protein factor H to activate Factor I-mediated cleavage
  of C3b to iC3b and C3f, thus attenuates C3b and C5b–9 deposition on cell surfaces
  (4). sNS1 also inhibits the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) directly
  by interacting with clusterin, vitronectin, and the terminal complement protein
  C9 (5). (B) Flavivirus sNS1 has also been shown to induce hyperpermeability in endothelial
  cells. Flavivirus sNS1 can trigger TLR4 signaling, leading to the secretion of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines (1). Moreover, sNS1 can bind to platelets via TLR4, leading to platelet
  activation and enhancement of the platelet aggregation (2). Then the activated platelets
  are adhered to the cell surface (3) and cause thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage (4).
  The endothelial glycocalyx layer (EGL) is a network of membrane-bound proteoglycans
  and glycoproteins that lines the endothelium on the luminal side (5). Flavivirus
  sNS1 binds to the surface of endothelial cells (6), upregulates the expression of
  sialidases (7) that translocate to the cell membrane, initiating the cleavage of
  sialic acid on EGL (8). In addition, flavivirus sNS1 enhances the activity of cathepsin
  L and the expression of pro-heparinase (9a). Cathepsin L processes pro-heparanase
  into an active form (9b), leading to the cleavage of heparan sulfate on the EGL
  (10). These processes together lead to EGL disruption of endothelial cells (11)
  and vascular leakage during flavivirus infection (12).
