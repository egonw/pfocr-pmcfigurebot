caption: Global proteomics analysis with NEM as an inhibitor for hydrogen sulfide
  pathway. (A) The second stage of a three-stage framework for integrating triple
  multi-omics data. (B) The pie chart displays the numbers of upregulated (log2 FC
  > 0.2), downregulated (log2 FC < −0.2), and unchanged proteins in the total number
  of proteins (7149) among control mice nerves (non-injured) and ex vivo mice nerves
  with or without NEM for 1 day in vitro (1DIV). Control, con; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide;
  NEM/1D, NEM treatment for 1DIV. (C) The fold change (log2) among 7149 proteins in
  the nerves at 1DIV compared with control (1DIV/Con) is shown on the x-axis. The
  y-axis shows the change of each protein in the nerves with or without NEM at 1DIV
  comparison. The red, blue, and gray dots represent decreased proteins at NEM/1D,
  increased proteins at NEM/1D, and unregulated proteins, respectively. (D) Hierarchical
  clustering (1–5) of ex vivo sciatic nerves at 1DIV (1DIV) vs. control and NEM/1D
  vs. 1DIV. (E) Protein expression dynamic clusters based on global protein expression
  patterns among control, 1DIV, and NEM/1D. Gene ontology (GO) biological processes
  upregulated (F) and downregulated (G) in response to NEM treatment are shown.
