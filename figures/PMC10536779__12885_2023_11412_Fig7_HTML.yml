caption: Functional enrichment of ROR1-AS1 in CCA. (A) GO enrichment analysis of differentially
  expressed genes in high- and low-ROR1-AS1 expression samples. (B) The protein levels
  of E-cadherin, Vimentin were detected by western blotting about ROR1-AS1. (C) GSEA
  of genes in the PBC signaling pathway. (D) GSEA of genes in the _BAM signaling pathway.
  (E) GSEA of genes in the ADIPOGENESIS pathway. (F) GSEA of genes in the COAGULATION
  pathway. (G) GSEA of genes in the CHOLESTEROL_HOMEOSTASIS. (H) GSEA of genes in
  the MET. CCA( cholangiocarcinoma), GO( gene ontology), GSEA( gene set enrichment
  analysis), MET(mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition)
