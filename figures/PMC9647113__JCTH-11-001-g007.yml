figure_title: GLT25D1 drives LX-2 cell activation through the TGF-β1/SMAD3 signaling
  pathway
caption: (A) Western blot analysis of total PI3K, phosphorylated PI3K, total AKT,
  phosphorylated AKT, total smad2, phosphorylated smad2, total smad3, phosphorylated
  smad3, total P38, phosphorylated P38 and α-SMA protein levels in sh-GLT25D1 cells
  24 h after stimulation with TGF-β1. (B) Western blot analysis of total PI3K, phosphorylated
  PI3K, total AKT, phosphorylated AKT, total smad2, phosphorylated smad2, total smad3,
  phosphorylated smad3, total P38, phosphorylated P38 and α-SMA protein levels in
  in OE-GLT25D1 cells 24 h after stimulation with TGF-β1. (C) Western blot analysis
  of p-smad3, COL I, COL III, and α-SMA protein levels in OE-GLT25D1 cells following
  24 h of incubation with 3 µM of Smad3 inhibitor (SIS3) and 4 µM of TGF-βRI ALK5
  inhibitor (SD208). Representative results from three independent experiments are
  shown.
