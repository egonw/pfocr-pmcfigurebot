caption: RRM2 promotes osteogenic differentiation in MEFs. (A) RT-qPCR analysis revealed
  the expression levels of RRM2 in MEFs after infection by AdRRM2. (B) WB and (C)
  semi-quantification of WB revealed RRM2 protein expression in MEFs following infection
  by AdRRM2. RT-qPCR analysis indicated the expression levels of early osteogenic
  markers (D) COL1A1, (E) DLX5, (F) OSX and (G) RUNX2 in MEFs after infection by AdRRM2
  for 2 or 3 days. (H) ALP staining and (I) quantification of ALP staining revealed
  the effect of RRM2 on ALP activity in MEFs after infection by AdRRM2 for 7 days.
  RT-qPCR analysis indicated the expression levels of late osteogenic markers (J)
  OPN and (K) OCN of MEFs after infection by AdRRM2 for 9 or 11 days. (L) AR staining
  indicated the effect of RRM2 on late bone mineralization in MEFs after infection
  by AdRRM2 for 21 days. **P<0.01 vs. AdGFP group. RRM2, ribonucleotide reductase
  M2; MEFs, mouse embryo fibroblasts; AdRRM2, RRM2-overexpressing recombinant adenovirus;
