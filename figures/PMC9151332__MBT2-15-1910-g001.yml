caption: Inactivation of genes involved in pyocyanin biosynthesis contributed to bacterial
  survivals of P. aeruginosa after CAP treatment.A. The biosynthetic pathway of pyocyanin
  pigment in P. aeruginosa.B. The pigment phenotypes of P. aeruginosa PAO1 and its
  derivatives phzA1::Tn, phzA2::Tn, ΔphzA1/ΔphzA2, phzM::Tn, and phzS::Tn mutants.
  Bacterial colonies were presented after 20 h of culture in Luria‐Bertani (LB) agar
  plates.C. The P. aeruginosa PAO1 and its derivatives were separately exposed to
  CAP for 30 s and followed 1 h incubation at room temperature. The survival cells
  were determined with the plate dilution method. Experiments were conducted five
  times. Statistical significance was calculated using One‐way ANOVA. **P < 0.01 and
  ***P < 0.001.
