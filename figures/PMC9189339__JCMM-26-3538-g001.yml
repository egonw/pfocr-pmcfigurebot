caption: RASSF4 negatively regulates CRC cell proliferation. (A) Western blot analysis
  in CRC cell lines HCT8, LoVo, HCT116, HCT15 and normal colon epithelial cell line
  HCO‐Epic. RT‐qPCR and Western blot confirmed the effect of plasmid and siRNA. (B)
  CCK‐8 demonstrated that RASSF4 overexpression decreased the LoVo cell line's growth
  speed, while RASSF4 siRNA knockdown increased the cell growth speed in the HCT‐8
  cell line. (C) Colony formation assays demonstrated that RASSF4 overexpression decreased
  colony counts in the LoVo cell line. RASSF4 siRNA knockdown increased colony counts
  in the HCT‐8 cell line. (D) Flow cytometry demonstrated that ectopic RASSF4 expression
  decreased the percentage of S phase in the LoVo cell line. RASSF4 knockdown increased
  the S phase percentage of HCT‐8 cells. *p < 0.05

  colorectal cancer through YAP/Bcl‐2 pathway.
