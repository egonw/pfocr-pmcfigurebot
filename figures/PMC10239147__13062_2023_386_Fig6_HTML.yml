caption: N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification regulates LINC01003 expression in glioma
  cells. A A RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay combined with RT-qPCR was used to
  determine the relative m6A enrichment at LINC01003 in U87MG and U251 cells. B RT-qPCR
  was used to determine the expression of LINC01003 in glioma cells with NC or METTL3
  siRNA. C A RIP assay combined with RT-qPCR was used to determine the relative m6A
  enrichment at LINC01003 in glioma cells with NC or METTL3 siRNA; ***P < 0.001
article_title: m6A-mediated upregulation of LINC01003 regulates cell migration by
  targeting the CAV1/FAK signaling pathway in glioma.
