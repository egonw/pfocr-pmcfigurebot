caption: Quantitative proteomic analysis of left ventricular cardiac tissue derived
  from desmin knock-out mice. (a) Hierarchical clustering of the proteomic data created
  a dendrogram with six distinct clusters. Clusters 1 to 3 showed higher protein amounts
  in the desmin knock-out cardiac tissue, while clusters 4 to 6 highlighted reduced
  protein amounts as compared to their wild-type sibling derived tissue. The heat
  map indicates increased protein levels in red and decreased values in green. For
  a list of all proteins used for hierarchical clustering please refer to ; for a
  bubble plot illustration of the “Gene Ontology (GO) term Cellular compartment (CC)”
  and “Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway” enrichments please
  refer to . (b) Volcano plot comparing protein levels of desmin knock-out and wild-type
  genotypes. X-axis, log2-transformed mean fold change; y-axis, -log10-transformed
  p-value. Light red and dark red as well as light and dark green dots indicate significantly
  up- and down-regulated proteins, respectively, with p-values of ≤ 0.05 or ≤ 0.001
  and a fold-change ≥ 2. For lists of significantly up- and downregulated proteins
  as well as all quantified proteins including non-significantly regulated and proteins
  of any fold-change in desmin knock-out left ventricular cardiac tissue please refer
