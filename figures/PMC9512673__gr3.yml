caption: 'PSMG2 knockdown downregulated PDPK1/AKT signaling(A) The scatterplot shows
  the correlation between proteasome and all 50 hallmark gene sets in the two single-cell
  transcriptome datasets (GEO: GSE75688 and GEO: GSE11838). The x axis and y axis
  represent the correlation coefficients of proteasome and hallmark gene sets in the
  GEO: GSE11838 and GEO: GSE75688 datasets, respectively. The size and color of the
  points represent the −log10 p value in the GEO: GSE11838 and GEO: GSE75688 datasets,
  respectively. The points of the top 5 signal pathways in the comprehensive correlation
  are marked with different colored outer circles.(B) The scatterplot shows the high
  correlation between mTOR signaling and proteasome in two independent single-cell
  transcriptomic datasets (GEO: GSE75688 and GEO: GSE11838). The pink triangles represent
  the GEO: GSE75688 dataset, and the blue dots represent the GEO: GSE11838 dataset.(C)
  After vector (pLKO.1) or PSMG2 shRNA (shPSMG2) transfection, BT549 and MB468 cells
  were treated with AZD6244 (1 μM) for 2 or 24 h, and then the phosphorylation of
  ERK in the MAPK pathway and the phosphorylation and total protein of AKT and PDPK1
  in the upstream mTOR pathway were detected by western blot. Loading control, β-actin.(D)
  BT549 and MB468 cells were treated with or without MG132 (2 μM) for 24 h and the
  related proteins were detected by western blot. Loading control, β-actin.(E) After
  transfection with vector (pLKO.1) or PDPK1 shRNA (shPDPK1), BT549 and MB468 cells
  were treated with AZD6244 (1 μM) for 2 or 24 h, and then the phosphorylation of
  ERK and AKT and total protein levels of PDPK1 were detected by western blot. Loading
  control, β-actin.(F) Clonogenic assays of PDPK1-knockdown cells (BT549 and MB468)
  treated with or without AZD6244 (1 μM) for 10–14 days.(G) The results of the clonogenic
  assays (F) were quantified by ImageJ. The quantitative results are presented as
  the mean ± SD (n = 4 technical replicates); ∗∗∗p < 0.001; one-way ANOVA.(H) After
  vector (pLKO.1) or PSMG2 shRNA (shPSMG2) transfection, BT549 and MB468 cells were
  transfected with vector (cPPT) or the overexpression vector for PDPK1 (PDPK1), then
  the phosphorylation of PDPK1 and AKT was analyzed by western blot. Loading control,
  β-actin.(I) Under PSMG2 shRNA (shPSMG2) transfection, BT549 and MB468 cells were
  transfected with vector (cPPT) or the vector for PDPK1 expression (cPPT-PDPK1) and
  treated with or without AZD6244 (0.1 or 0.5 μM) for 10–14 days.(J and K) The results
  of the clonogenic assays (I) were quantified by ImageJ. The quantitative results
  are presented as the mean ± SD (n = 4 technical replicates); ∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001;
  one-way ANOVA.'
