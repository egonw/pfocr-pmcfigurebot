figure_title: Gene family and pathway enrichment in HS vs. SCC
caption: Volcano plots show differentially abundant pathways (a) and gene families
  (b) identified in matched HS and SCC samples through paired Wilcoxon test with FDR-corrected
  p-values (q-value). For legibility, only a subset of gene families is labelled in
  the plot. For b, the comprehensive list of all differentially abundant gene families
  is listed in . For pathways and gene families, a q-value <0.05 with a log2-fold
  change (Log2FC) of 2 were deemed significant (green). Data points to the far right
  or far left indicate zero abundance in HS or SCC, respectively.
