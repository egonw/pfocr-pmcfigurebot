caption: 'Isorhamnetin suppressed ZEA-induced apoptosis. Ovarian GC were cultured
  with isorhamnetin (20 μmol/L) for 2 h, before treatment with ZEA (60 μmol/L) for
  24 h. (A) Structure of isorhamnetin. (B) The viability of ovarian GC treated with
  ZEA for 24 h. (C) The effect of pretreatment with different concentrations of isorhamnetin
  on the viability of ZEA (60 μmol/L)-exposed ovarian GC. (D) Western blot analysis
  showed Bcl-2, Bax and C-Casp3 expression in ovarian GC treated with ZEA or isorhamnetin.
  (E to G) Relative quantification (Western blot) of the protein expression of Bcl-2,
  Bax and C-Casp3 normalized to β-actin expression. (H) Representative images of mitochondrial
  distribution in ovarian GC treated with ZEA or isorhamnetin. Scale bars: 200 μm.
  (I) Western blot analysis of PGC-1 in ovarian GC treated with ZEA or isorhamnetin.
  (J) Relative quantification (Western blot) of the protein expression of PGC-1 normalized
  to β-actin expression. (K) Western blot analysis of LC3 and P62 in ovarian GC treated
  with ZEA or isorhamnetin. (L to M) Relative quantification (Western blot) of the
  protein expression of LC3 and P62 normalized to β-actin expression. Data are expressed
  as means ± SEM. Different letters mean significant differences (P < 0.05). ZEA = zearalenone;
  GC = granulosa cell; Bcl-2 = b-cell lymphoma-2; Bax = bcl2-associated x; C-Casp3 = cleaved-caspase-3;
  PGC-1 = pparγ co-activator-1; LC3 = microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain
  3; P62 = the sequestosome 1 protein.'
