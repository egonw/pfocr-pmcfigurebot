caption: In the tumor environment, DRAK2 can promote tumor growth by blocking TGF-Î²
  signaling. DRAK2 acts mainly by blocking phosphorylated Smad2/3 proteins from binding
  to Smad4 and thus blocking the entry of the complex into the nucleus. However, later
  studies have shown that DRAK2 is not involved in this pathway.
