caption: MSC-CM promotes cell proliferation and migration in lung cancer cells.A and
  B, numbers of lung cancer cells treated with Control-CM or MSC-CM at the indicated
  time points were counted using a hemocytometer. C and D, cell viability in Control-CM–treated
  and MSC-CM–treated groups was detected using an MTS assay. The raw 490 nm absorbance
  values and the relative cell viability percentages are expressed as bar graphs.
  E and F, the colony-forming ability of LM and A549 cells treated with or without
  MSC-CM for 14 days was assessed and is expressed as a percentage relative to the
  control group. G and H, a Transwell assay was performed to determine the effect
  of MSC-CM on tumor cell migration. The average number of migrating cells in each
  Transwell insert was calculated from five randomly selected fields. Representative
  images from three independent biological replicates are shown in E-H, and the quantitative
  results are displayed as mean ± standard deviation. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p
  < 0.001, two-tailed t test. CM, conditioned medium; LM, low-motility; MSC, mesenchymal
  stem cell.
