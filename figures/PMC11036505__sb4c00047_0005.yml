caption: Strategies for increasing natural-product yields via cell-type-specific engineering.
  A. Increased densities of glandular secretory trichomes in A. annua via network
  engineering to tune the abundance of developmental regulators AaMIXTA1 (MIXTA-Like
  1), AaHD1 (HD-ZIP IV 1), and AaHD8 (HD-ZIP IV 8). B. The vinblastine biosynthetic
  pathway is divided into five subpathways, spatially separated across four cell types
  in Catharanthus roseus (left). The MEP pathway (1) and Iridoid pathway (2) are predominantly
  in phloem-associated parenchyma cells. The late iridoid pathway (3) and alkaloid
  pathway are in epidermal cells, and the late alkaloid pathway (5) in idioblast cells
  (brown) and laticifer cells. Yield increases (right, purple annotations) might be
  achieved via (i) developmental reprogramming to increase laticifer branching or
  idioblast density, (ii) upregulation of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase
  (DXS) in phloem-associated parenchyma, (iii) upregulation of the rate-limiting acetyl-CoA:4-O-deacetylvindoline
  4-O-acetyltransferase (DAT) in idioblast and laticifer cells, and (iv) expression
  of horseradish peroxidase in idioblast or laticifers to aid oxidative coupling of
  catharanthine and vindoline.
