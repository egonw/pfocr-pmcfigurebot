caption: Differential effect on cell viability by individual amino acid-deprived conditions
  in SKOV3-TR cells. (A–C) SKOV3 and SKOV3-TR cells were cultured in medium treated
  with indicated concentrations of paclitaxel (PTX) for 48 h. (A) The cell viabilities
  of SKOV3 and SKOV3-TR cells were measured by MTT assay, and cells were visualized
  using a microscope after treatment with 100 nM of paclitaxel. (B) The apoptotic
  cleaved PARP was analyzed by immunoblotting, PC (positive control); SKOV3-TR cells
  treated with 2000 nM of paclitaxel. Protein expression was quantified as fold changes
  with respect to the control after normalization of respective β-actin levels using
  ImageJ software. (C) The cytotoxic effect of SKOV3 and SKOV3-TR cells on paclitaxel
  were measured by crystal violet staining. (D) SKOV3-TR cells were cultured in medium
  deprived of each of the 20 amino acids for 48 h. Cell viabilities were measured
  by MTT assay. (E) Microscopic observations of SKOV3-TR cells in arginine-, glutamine-,
  lysine- and glycine-deprived culture conditions after 48 h. The data are presented
  as the mean percentage of control. CM, complete media; PTX, paclitaxel.
