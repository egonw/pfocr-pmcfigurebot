caption: PERK pathway was suppressed in tunicamycin‐induced prolonged endoplasmic
  reticulum stress in Huh7.5 cells. Huh7.5 cells were treated with 10 μg/mL of tunicamycin
  for 48 hours. Representative western blots showed that the levels of PERK and p‐PERK
  increased within 4 hours after the initiation of treatment and then decreased at
  24‐ and 48‐hour time points compared with the control group; meanwhile, ATF6α levels
  were increased. The deglycosylation of ATF6α presented twice—first at 2 hours after
  treatment and again at 24 and 48 hours after the initiation of treatment. Cleaved
  ATF6αf increased at the 24‐hour time point. The levels of IRE1α were increased later
  than that of PERK but lasted longer than PERK. This experiment was repeated 3 times
  independently. ATF6α, activating transcription factor 6α; ATF6αf, the cytosolic
  fragment of ATF6α; ctrl, control; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3‐phosphate dehydrogenase;
  h, hours; IRE1α, inositol‐requiring transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease 1α; PERK,
  protein kinase R‐like endoplasmic reticulum kinase; p‐IRE1α, phosphorylated IRE1α;
  p‐PERK, phosphorylated PERK; TM, tunicamycin
