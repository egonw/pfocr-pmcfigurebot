caption: TSG-6 expression in ASCs and macrophages after indirect coculture. For indirect
  coculture using Transwell plates, ASCs and macrophages were seeded in upper and
  lower chamber (and vice versa) and then total RNA and protein samples were prepared
  from cells in the lower chamber. (A) Relative TSG-6 mRNA expression in ASCs and
  macrophages after indirect coculture. (B) Relative TSG-6 expression in ASCs and
  macrophages after indirect coculture. (C) TSG-6 expression in ASCs cocultured with
  RAW 264.7 murine macrophages. ASCs and RAW 264.7 cells were seeded in lower and
  upper chamber, respectively, and the TSG-6 expression in ASCs was analyzed using
  immunoblotting. Relative expression was normalized with respect to GAPDH expression.
  Data are presented as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. * p ≤ 0.05,
  ** p ≤ 0.01, and *** p < 0.001. TW, Transwell; A, ASCs; M, macrophages; R, RAW 264.7
  murine macrophages.
