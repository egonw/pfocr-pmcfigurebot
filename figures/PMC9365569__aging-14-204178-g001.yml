caption: Downregulation of CFHR3 is associated with a poor prognosis of HCC patients.
  (A) Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between HCC and normal liver tissues in
  TCGA-LIHC cohort are shown as a volcano plot. (B) The overlap between DEGs, the
  most significant overall survival (OS) related genes, and the most significantly
  disease-free survival (DFS) related genes in the TCGA database is displayed as a
  Venn diagram. (C) The difference in CFHR3 transcript levels between normal liver
  and HCC tissues is presented as a box plot. (Dâ€“F) The difference in CFHR3 transcript
  levels between HCC subgroups, including tumor size (D, T1-2, and T3-4), tumor recurrence
  (E, non-recurrence and recurrence), and clinical stage (F, stage I-II, and stage
  III-IV) is presented as a box plot, respectively. (G, H) The difference in OS rates
  (G) or DFS rates (H) between HCC patients with low and high CFHR3 transcript levels
  in HCC tissues is shown as a survival curve, respectively. (I, J) The independent
  prognostic factor for OS (I) and DFS (J) of HCC patients, based on the multivariate
  Cox proportional hazard model, is shown in each forest plot, respectively.
