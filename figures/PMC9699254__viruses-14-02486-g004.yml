caption: Enterovirus infection does not induce Xbp1 mRNA splicing and activation of
  the Xbp1 downstream target ERdj4. (A) Total RNA from HeLa cells infected with PV,
  mock-infected, or treated with 10 mM DTT was isolated at the indicated time points.
  The relative level of the spliced Xbp1 mRNA was measured by RT-qPCR with primers
  specific to Xbp1s mRNA isoform and to RPL19 mRNA as a reference. (B) The same experiment
  with CVB3. Each experiment was performed in duplicate and repeated at least three
  times. (C) Total RNA from HeLa cells infected with PV, mock-infected, or treated
  with 10 mM DTT was isolated at the indicated time points. The relative level of
  ERdj4 mRNA was measured by RT-qPCR with primers specific to the ERdj4 mRNA and RPL19
  mRNA as a reference. (D) The same experiment with CVB3.
