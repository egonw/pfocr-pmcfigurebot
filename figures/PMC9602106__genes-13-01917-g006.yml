caption: 'Summary of the findings discussed in this review. The taxonomic relationship
  between the species mentioned in this work is displayed on the top of the figure.
  The characterized VC synthesis pathways and the putative alternatives in eukaryote
  and prokaryote species are presented in the mid part of the figure. The pathways
  already described in the literature are highlighted with bold colors according to
  the taxonomic groups mentioned, while the putative VC pathways are presented in
  the gridline sections. The enzymes that intervene in the substrate conversions are
  presented by numbered circles according to the following scheme: Circles in white
  represent enzymatic reactions described in the literature, circles in yellow represent
  hypothetical enzymatic reactions and circles in green indicate novel enzymatic constituents
  of putative alternative VC synthesis pathways with available functional characterization.
  The question marks (?) represent putative enzymatic reactions for which no candidate
  enzyme can be suggested with current data. The tissues correlated with VC synthesis
  in animal species are represented below the corresponding proposed pathways when
  available. The dashed box highlights the myo-Inositol VC synthesis pathway that
  is exclusively used by species that synthesize VC in the kidney. The phylogenetic
  relationship inferred between the studied AOs is summarized in a cladogram format
  at the bottom. The enzyme number and substrate acronym lists are presented below
  the figure to facilitate the interpretation.'
