caption: Pexmetinib inhibited breast cancer cells migration and invasion in vitro.
  (A, B) Cell viability of Pexmetinib treated MDA-MB-231 cells were tested by CCK-8
  assays at 48 and 96 h. (C) The IC50 value of Pexmetinib at 96 h on MDA-MB-231 cells.
  (D) The effects of Pexmetinib on MDA-MB-231 cells migration and invasion at a dose
  dependent manner were determined by transwell assay. (E) Migration and invasion
  rates were measured using Image J and normalized relative to the control group.
  (F) The MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with different doses of Pexmetinib (0, 1,
  2, 4 μM) for 24 h. The gene expressions of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were tested by RT-PCR.
  (G) The MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with different doses of Pexmetinib (0, 1,
  2, 4 μM) for 24 h. The western blot was performed to detected bond images of indicated
  proteins. (H) Quantitative analysis of protein gray levels related to β-actin by
  imageJ. Scale bar = 100 μm, *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01. Data are expressed as means ± SEM,
  n = 5.
