caption: Highest confidence network of genes displaying altered ELOVL2 expression
  in MCF-7/TamR. ELOVL2 is overexpressed in MCF-7/TamR and a genome-wide expression
  analysis is performed. (A) Heatmap analysis of 969 genes that are significantly
  deregulated by ELOVL2. The data are from the microarray in duplicates. (B) Highest
  confidence network of genes displaying altered expression identifies “Cardiovascular
  Disease, Cell-To-Cell Signaling and Interaction, Inflammatory Response” pathway
  and “Behavior, Reproductive System Development and Function, Cardiac Infarction”
  pathway as the top networks. Genes that are upregulated are shaded in red, whereas
  those that are downregulated are shaded in green, with the color intensity signifying
  the magnitude of expression change. Solid lines representing direct interactions,
  and dashed lines representing indirect interactions. (C) Top 10 canonical pathways
  and (D) disease and function annotation of the genes of which expression is significantly
  altered by ELOVL2. The most significant canonical pathway is “Antigen Presentation
  Pathway” and disease and function annotation is “Solid tumor”.
