caption: HAPSTR1 cooperates with HUWE1 to control stress signaling. (A and B) HUWE1
  is the most coessential gene for HAPSTR1 (A), and this relationship is markedly
  strong compared with all other correlations (Corr) in the genome (B). (C) Phenotypic
  convergence based on differentially expressed gene (DEG) overlap of HAPSTR1 and
  HUWE1 knockdown RNA-seq data in 231 cells. Gene set enrichment analysis terms shown
  (false discovery rate [FDR] < 1e-5). K-means clustering, K = 7. (D) HUWE1 depletion
  recapitulates the effects of HAPSTR1 loss on model signaling proteins, despite increasing
  HAPSTR1 levels. U2OS. L, long; S, short. *PPIA-FLAG (PPIA-F) was transfected in
  separate experiments. Representative blots, n ≥ 3. (E) For five model signaling
  proteins, quantification of the effect of HAPSTR1 or HUWE1 depletion in cells chronically
  depleted of the other factor, as in SI Appendix, Fig. S9B, compared with acute knockdown
  in WT cells. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.005, two-tailed t test. ns, not significant. (F)
  Genes differentially expressed (RNA-seq FDR < 0.05) in 293T cells 24 h after transient
  overexpression of HAPSTR1 are not regulated by HAPSTR1 overexpression in cells lacking
  HUWE1. (G) Schematic model of the HAPSTR1–HUWE1 pathway. GFP, green fluorescent
  protein; L2FC, Log2foldchange.
