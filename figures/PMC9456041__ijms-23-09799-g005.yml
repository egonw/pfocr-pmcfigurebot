caption: Short hairpin RNA-mediated MAVS knockdown attenuated the RuV-triggered IFN-β
  signaling pathway. (A) Total RNAs extracted from U373MG cells expressing MAVS-targeting
  shRNAs (sh1MAVS and sh2MAVS) or a non-targeting shRNA (shNT) that were uninfected
  (M) or infected with the RuV RA27/3 strain (+) at 2 dpi (MOI of 1.8) were subjected
  to RT-PCR for the detection of MAVS, IFN-β, and viperin mRNAs and RuV RNAs encoding
  the capsid protein. TBP mRNA was analyzed as a reference. The products were analyzed
  by agarose gel electrophoresis. (B) Protein lysates from shRNAs (sh1MAVS, sh2MAVS,
  and shNT)-expressing U373MG cells that were uninfected (M) or infected with the
  RuV RA27/3 strain (+) at 2 dpi (MOI of 1.8) were analyzed by immunoblotting for
  the protein expression of MAVS, STAT1, Tyr701-phosphorylated STAT1 (p-STAT1), ISGs
  (RIG-I, ISG56, MX1, and viperin), and RuV-encoded capsid proteins. GAPDH protein
  was analyzed as a reference. Densitometric analysis of MAVS and capsid proteins
  was performed with NIH ImageJ software. Signal intensity of those proteins was normalized
  to that of GAPDH, then shown as a relative ratio of shNT-expressing U373MG cells
  infected with the RuV RA27/3 strain.
