caption: 'KLF5 mediates LPA−induced expression of EMT markers and fibrotic factors
  in HK-2 cells. HK-2 cells were transfected with a control siRNA (siCon) or LPAR1
  siRNA (siLPAR1) for 6 h. Next, the medium was replaced with SFM for 16–18 h, and
  the cells were treated with 20 μM LPA for 48 h. Protein levels of (A) KLF5, (B)
  E-cadherin and vimentin, and (C) fibronectin and α-SMA were analyzed via Western
  blotting, quantified using ImageJ software, and normalized to that of β-actin. Representative
  images (left) and quantitative analysis bar graphs (right) are shown (n = 3 independent
  experiments). Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, ***
  p < 0.005 vs. siCon or siCon + BSA; # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, ### p < 0.005 vs. siCon
  + LPA.'
