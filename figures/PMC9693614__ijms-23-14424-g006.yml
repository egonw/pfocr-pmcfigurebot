caption: 'Mammary gland development-related gene analysis. (a) Gene Ontology (GO)
  analysis of 226 genes associated with mammary gland development. (b) Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of genes associated with
  mammary gland development. (c) Protein-protein interaction analysis of genes enriched
  in PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. (d) Analysis of expression patterns of core genes
  at different developmental stages. Lowercase letters represent significance at the
  0.05 level. (e) The results of interference or overexpression of PDGFRB in mammary
  epithelial cells cultured in vitro by Western blotting. si-NC: native control of
  small interfering RNA (empty vector of siRNA); si-PDGFRB: the small interfering
  RNA targeting PDGFRB; NC: native control (empty vector of pcDNA3.1); PDGFRB: PDGFRB
  overexpression vector. ** indicates p < 0.01, NS indicates not significant, the
  data are presented as the mean Â± SEM (n = 3).'
