figure_title: RNA-seq analysis of doxycycline-inducible ATRX knockdown HFFs stimulated
  with IFN-β
caption: '(A) Schematic representation of the experiment. Doxycycline-inducible ATRX
  knockdown (ATRX kd) HFFs were either treated with 500 ng/ml doxycycline (dox) for
  14 days (d) or left untreated as a control, followed by stimulation with IFN-β (3.28
  × 103 U/ml) for 24 h. Subsequently, total RNAs were prepared and subjected to RNA-seq.
  Samples were divided in four groups of triplicates (untreated: wt; only IFN-β-treated:
  IFN; only dox-treated: dox; dox- and IFN-β-treated: doxIFN). (B) Venn-diagram of
  pairwise comparisons of the four groups. Differentially expressed genes were filtered
  to an adjusted p-value < 0.01. The following online tool was used: http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/
  (accessed 13 Sep 2021). (C) Homer de novo motif analysis of promoter regions of
  the differentially expressed genes from the comparison dox vs doxIFN. The top motif
  (p-value of 10−14) is shown (top) aligned with one of the matched known motifs (bottom).
  (D) Scatter plot of log2 fold changes from the comparison of dox vs doxIFN and wt
  vs IFN for every gene (n = 1893) with an adjusted p-value < 0.01. (E) Gene ontology
  (GO) terms of the category biological process for 85 corresponding proteins out
  of the top 100 hits with reduced log2 fold changes in dox vs doxIFN compared to
  wt vs IFN; FDR: false discovery rate. (F) Heat map of proteins belonging to the
  GO terms response to cytokine (GO:0034097) and cytokine-mediated signaling pathway
  (GO:0019221).'
