caption: Examination of direct target genes of miR-4730. (A) Results of microarray
  analysis of the candidate target genes of miR-4730 were arranged in order of the
  fold change of mock and mimic transfection. The candidate gene, HMGA1, is marked
  in the plot. (B) HMGA1 expression was analyzed using reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR and western blot analysis following the overexpression of miR-4730. HMGA1 expression
  was significantly decreased. (C) Results of the luciferase reporter assay demonstrated
  that the overexpression of miR-4730 decreased luciferase activity following transfection
  with the WT vector of HMGA1. The WT or MT sequence of HMGA1 is shown on the right
  panel. Experiments were performed in triplicate and results are shown as the mean
  Â± SD. An unpaired t-test was used to analyze the data (*P<0.05 and **P<0.01, vs.
  mock group or MT). HMGA1, high mobility group A1; WT, wild-type; MT, mutant-type.
