caption: Heat map showing upregulated and downregulated genes in oxaliplatin-resistant
  colon cancer tumors. A bidirectional hierarchical clustering heat map was constructed
  using the CIMminer web tool. Expression values are log fold changes (>1.0 or <-1.0,
  with a false detection rate of <0.05) between corresponding oxaliplatin-resistant
  LoVo cells and parental LoVo cells. Red represents upregulation, black represents
  no change in expression level, and green represents downregulation.

  and the Small Molecule for Overcoming Oxaliplatin Resistance of Metastatic Colorectal
  Cancer.
