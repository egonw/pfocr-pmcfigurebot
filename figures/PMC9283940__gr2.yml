caption: Metabolic pathway enrichment(A) MRN of enriched metabolic pathways (p < 0.05
  by hypergeometric distribution) and the 19 intestinal promoters. Promoters are represented
  as gray rectangles, and enriched pathways as color-coded ovals. Orange edges indicate
  repressing interactions (fluorescence up), blue edges indicate activating interactions
  (fluorescence down), and black edges indicate mixed fluorescence. K-out indicates
  the number of promoters regulated by each pathway. Related to .(B) Examples of four
  promoter-pathway networks. The connected rings start at level 1 (smaller ring) and
  go inward to level 4 (larger ring, closest to the promoter). Within the levels,
  the same pathways use the same color code. Enriched pathways (p < 0.05 by hypergeometric
  distribution) are indicated by filled ovals and non-enriched pathways (p > 0.05)
  are indicated by empty ovals. Related to  for additional promoter networks.(C) Examples
  of two pathway-promoter networks. Pathways are colored as in (B). Related to  for
  additional enriched pathway networks.
