caption: 'Graphical scheme showing cellular processes that are affected by Slt2 through
  the phosphorylation of the indicated substrates. Cellular processes are grouped
  by color based on the functional implication of substrate phosphorylation, as in
  : modulation of signaling through CWI pathway (blue), regulation of other signaling
  pathways (green), regulation of gene transcription and mRNA transport (yellow),
  cell cycle control (gray), and undetermined Slt2-dependent phosphorylation role
  (pink). The hexagons delimited by dashed lines show suggested but not formally proven
  Slt2-dependent functions (pink), or Slt2-regulated processes for which the specific
  substrates involved have not yet been identified (white).'
