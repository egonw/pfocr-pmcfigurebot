caption: 'Silencing of miR-373-3p weakened the inhibiting effects of ASP on the TGF-β/Smad4
  pathway in U251 cells. (a) The protein expressions of TGF-β and Smad4 were detected
  by western blotting. (b) Relative fluorescence of TGF-β and Smad4 were detected
  by immunofluorescence. (c) Positive cells for TGF-β and Smad4 following immunofluorescence.
  U251 cells were transfected with the miR-373-3p inhibitor/inhibitor NC and treated
  with 0.4 mg/mL ASP. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. control; #P < 0.05,
  ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001 vs. ASP; &&P < 0.01, &&&P < 0.001 vs. ASP + inhibitor NC.'
