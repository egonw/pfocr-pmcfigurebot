caption: Homology between the rubellin candidate cluster and gene clusters involved
  in the biosynthesis of known secondary metabolites structurally related to rubellin;
  (A) The cladofulvin biosynthetic gene cluster in C. fulvum was described by Griffith
  et al.; (B) The rubellin candidate gene cluster in R. collo-cygni consists of gene
  clusters organised around the core gene rccG as well as two miniclusters named rccL-
  and rccD miniclusters organised around rccL and rccD, respectively; (C) The monodictyphenone
  biosynthetic gene cluster in A. nidulans was identified by Chiang et al. []. Homology
  was confirmed by reciprocal BLAST using the NCBI database.
