figure_title: Inhibition of cathepsin D (Cat D) induces IκB degradation via the autophagy-lysosome
  pathway
caption: A, B Examination of protein expression in Caki/Cat D WT and KO cells (A)
  or Cont and Cat D siRNA-transfected cells (B). C Caki/Cat D KO cells and Cat D siRNA-transfected
  cells were transfected with vector, Cat D WT, or Cat D mutants (D97N and D295N),
  and protein expression was determined. D Caki cells were transiently transfected
  with Cont siRNA or Cat D siRNA, and they were treated with 0.5 μM MG132, 2.5 μM
  lactacystin, 10 μM chloroquine, and 5 nM bafilomycin A1 for 24 h (left panel). Caki
  cells were treated with 0.5 μM MG132 for 30 min, and 20 ng/mL TNF-α was then added
  for 24 h (right panel). E Cancer cells (Caki, HT29 and DU145) were transiently transfected
  with Cont siRNA, Beclin1 siRNA, and ATG7 siRNA, and they were further treated with
  2 μM Pep A for 24 h. F Caki cells were transiently transfected with HA-Ub, HA-K48-Ub,
  and HA-K63-Ub, and they were pretreated with 0.5 μM MG132 and 5 nM bafilomycin A1.
  Thereafter, they were treated with 2 μM Pep A or 20 ng/mL TNF-α for 24 h. The ubiquitination
  of endogenous IκB was analyzed via the DUB assay. Protein expression was measured
  via western blotting (A–F).
