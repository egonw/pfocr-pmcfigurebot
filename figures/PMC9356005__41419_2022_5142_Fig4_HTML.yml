figure_title: Potential therapeutic targets in Treg mediated muscular dystrophy
caption: Tregs delay the progression of DMD by releasing IL-10. In addition, Tregs
  suppress the inflammatory response by limiting the release of IFN-Î³ from effector
  T cells and releasing IL-5 which promotes the conversion of M1 macrophages to M2
  macrophages. Tcra and Tcrb recombinant gene therapy and blockade of the ATP/P2X
  signalling pathway have potential in DMD treatment by regulating Tregs and delaying
  muscular dystrophy progression. DMD, Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
