caption: IGFBP6 expression levels and ERK pathway analysis in HGSOC PEA1 and PEA2
  cell lines. IGFBP6 (A) quantitative PCR and (B) immunoblot analysis in PEA1 and
  PEA2 OC cells lines. β-actin was used as loading marker. *P<0.05. (C) p-ERK1/2 immunoblot
  analysis in PEA1 and PEA2 cells cultured in serum-free medium overnight and subsequently
  stimulated with IGFBP6 recombinant protein (1 µg/ml) for 10 min. GAPDH was used
  as loading marker. (B and C) Histograms represent band intensity ± SD and the ratio
  of phosphorylated/total proteins from the densitometric analysis of three independent
  experiments. *P≤0.05. IGFBP6, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6; ERK,
  extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HGSOC, high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma;
  PEA1, pleural effusion adenocarcinoma-1; PEA2, pleural effusion adenocarcinoma-2;
  PCR, polymerase chain reaction; OC, ovarian cancer; p-ERK1/2, phosphorylated-extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.

  protein 6 in platinum-sensitive versus platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian
  carcinoma cell lines.
