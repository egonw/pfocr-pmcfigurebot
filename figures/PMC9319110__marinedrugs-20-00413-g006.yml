caption: 'Effects of the E. maxima purified leaf fucoidan fraction 7 (EMLF7) on particulate
  matter (PM)-induced iNOS, COX2, and NF-κB pathway protein expression in RAW 264.7
  cells. (a) Expression analysis of iNOS, COX2, p50, p65, and phosphorylation in cytosol
  and nucleus evaluated using Western blotting after the treatment of EMLF7 in PM-activated
  macrophages, (b) quantification of iNOS and COX-2 expression, (c) quantification
  of p50 and p65 in cytosol, and (d) quantification of p50 and p65 in the nucleus.
  Experiments were carried out in triplicate and the results are represented as means
  ± SD (n = 3). Values are significantly different from the PM-treated group at *
  p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 or ## p < 0.01 against the control. An amount of 50 µM
  of Dexamethasone (Dex) was used as a positive control.'
