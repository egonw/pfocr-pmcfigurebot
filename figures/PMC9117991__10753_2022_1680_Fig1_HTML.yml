caption: 'a). The metabolic pathway showing two axes of RAS system: (1) “Classical
  RAS ACE–Ang II–AT1 regulatory axis” and (2) “ACE2–Ang–(1–7)–Mas counter-regulatory
  axis.” Abbreviations: (P) RR, (pro) renin receptor; Ang, angiotensin; ACE, angiotensin-converting
  enzyme; ACE2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; NEP, neutral endopeptidase; PEP,
  prolyl endopeptidase; PCP, prolyl carboxypeptidase. Courtesy Gupta and Gupta []. b).
  Structure of S CTD—human ACE2 Complex: The core subdomain and external subdomain
  in SARS-CoV-2- CTD are colored cyan and orange, respectively. hACE2 subdomains I
  and II are colored violet and green, respectively. The right panel (B) was obtained
  by anticlockwise rotation of the left panel (A) along a longitudinal axis [PDB:6LZG].
