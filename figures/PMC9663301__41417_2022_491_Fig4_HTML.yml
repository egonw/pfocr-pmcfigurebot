figure_title: Synergistic effect of the MTOR inhibitor torin-1 and the AKT inhibitor
  capivasertib
caption: A Heatmap representation of Bliss interaction index for RCH-ACV cells treated
  with the MTOR inhibitor torin-1 and the AKT inhibitor capivasertib. Data represent
  the mean of three independent experiments. B Titration curve for RCH-ACV cells treated
  with torin-1 in combination with vehicle or capivasertib. Data represent mean ± SEM
  of three independent experiments. P values were calculated using non-linear regression
  analysis and curves were compared with the sum-of-squares F test. ns not significant,
  **p < 0.01.
