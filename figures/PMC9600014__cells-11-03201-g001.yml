caption: Hypothetical common pathogenesis and targets for Alzheimer’s disease. Amyloidogenic
  process and neurotrophic pathways are mutually inhibited. Original deficit in any
  of the two pathways may dysregulate the other one and mutually aggravate each other,
  or coordinately cause or deteriorate AD. Abnormal expression or activities of the
  regulators (brown and yellow boxes) result in the dysregulated expression or activities
  of the key proteins (pink boxes), leads to overloaded neurotoxicity and degraded
  neurotrophic effects, and finally, causes Alzheimer’s disease. Targeting these regulators
  (red dotted arrows)—including recover the expression levels or correcting the mutations
  via gene therapies or specific drugs, or modifying the activity to compensate for
  the dysfunction resulting from abnormal expression levels or mutation—might be effective
  strategies to treat AD.
