caption: Pathways, associated with immune cells, such as B cell receptor, TCR signaling,
  interactions between immune cells and microRNAs in the tumor microenvironment, T
  helper pathway, TCRA pathway, DC pathway, CTL pathway, B lymphocyte pathway, ASB
  cell pathway, and granulocytes pathway were demonstrated significantly differential
  enrichment between PTPRN high and low expression groups according to NES, FDR, and
  p-value.
