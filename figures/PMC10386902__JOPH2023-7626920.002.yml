caption: 'Schematic effects induced by ECM stiffness and TGFβ regulating YAP/TAZ activity
  in HTM cells. (a) The increase in ECM stiffness promotes elevated intraocular pressure.
  (b) Ocular pathologic features of the eye with glaucoma compared to the normal eye.
  (c) Upregulation of ECM stiffness may regulate the formation of focal adhesion and
  actin skeleton rearrangement to improve YAP/TAZ activity and its nuclear translocation.
  Meanwhile, ECM stiffness activated TGFβ triggers ERK and ROCK signaling pathways,
  which also promotes the upregulation of YAP/TAZ activity. The transcription complex
  formed by YAP/TAZ and TEAD in the nucleus activates a variety of mechanically stimulated
  target genes (TGM2, FN, CRGF, PAI-1, vinculin, α-SMA, P-MLC, F-actin) to promote
  cell contractility and ECM remodeling in HTM, which can aggravate the tissue stiffness
  of HTM, lead to fibrotic phenotype, enhanced aqueous humor outflow resistance, increased
  IOP, and exacerbate the progression of glaucoma. In addition, the inhibition of
  the Wnt signaling pathway can promote RhoA to initiate downstream ECM stiffness-raising
  phenotype, finally leading to elevated IOP. CTGF: connective tissue growth factor.
  α-SMA: α-smooth muscle actin. COLA1: alpha-1 type I collagen. c-myc: the regulator
  genes and proto-oncogenes that code for transcription factors. TGM2: transglutaminase
  2. P-MLC: phospho-myosin light chain. PAI-1: plasminogen activator inhibitor-1.
  F-actin: actin filaments. Vinculin: a membrane-cytoskeletal protein in focal adhesion
  plaques.'
