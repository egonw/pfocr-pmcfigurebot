caption: Effect of AQP8 overexpression and knockdown on apoptosis in A172 and U251
  cells. (A-D) Apoptosis rates of A172 and U251 cells in each group on flow cytometry
  of PI- and annexin V-stained cells. AQP8 overexpression (O.E) and knockdown (K.D)
  reduced and increased the apoptosis rate in A172 and U251 cells, respectively (vs.
  control, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01). (E-F) Hoechst staining on A172 and U251 cells of
  each group. Red arrows in E and F refer to apoptotic cells (blue). (G, H) The percentage
  of apoptotic A172 and U251 cells in each group with Hoechst staining. (vs. control,
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01). AQP, aquaporin; NC, negative control; O.E, overexpressed;
  K.D, knockdown. All experiments were performed in triplicate
article_title: AQP8 promotes glioma proliferation and growth, possibly through the
  ROS/PTEN/AKT signaling pathway.
