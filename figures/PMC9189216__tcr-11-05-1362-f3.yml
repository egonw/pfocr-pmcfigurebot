caption: Verification of the CHROMR/miR-1299/CNNM1 pathway through cell function,
  RT-qPCR, and Western Blot experiments. (A) After transfection of CHROMR-over plasmid
  and miR-1299 mimic recovery, we detected CHROMR, miR-1299, CNNM1 expression changes
  in SU_DHL_4 cell line by RT-qPCR. (B) After transfection of CHROMR-over plasmid
  and miR-1299 mimic recovery, we detected apoptosis-related genes and CNNM1 expression
  by Western Blot. + indicates that the substance is transfected, âˆ’ indicates that
  the substance is not transfected. (C) In the case of rituximab killing, flow cytometry
  detected the proportion of cells in the G2 phase of each group. (D) In the case
  of rituximab killing, the proportion of apoptosis in each group was detected by
  flow cytometry. ***, P<0.001. NC, negative control; RT-qPCR, real time quantitative
  polymerase chain reaction.
article_title: Long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) CHROMR promotes the expression of the
  CNNM1 gene by adsorbing hsa-miR-1299 to obtain drug resistance in diffuse large
  B lymphoma cells.
