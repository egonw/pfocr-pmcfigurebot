caption: 'Effects of KY19382 in wound healing and stem cell markers. Wounded tissues
  excised from 12 d post wounding of  were subjected to IHC analyses. (A) Representative
  images for IHC analyses of β-catenin, Collagen I, PCNA, and Keratin 14 at wounds
  12 d post wounding. Dashed lines demarcate the epidermis boundary (n = 3, independent
  experiments). (B) Mean intensity values for A (n = 3, independent experiments).
  (C) Representative images for IHC analyses of CD34 and Nestin at wounds 12 d post
  wounding. Dashed lines demarcate the epidermis boundary (n = 3, independent experiments).
  (D) Mean intensity values for C (n = 3 independent experiments). Original magnification:
  (A), ×200; (C), ×400. Values are expressed as means ± SEM. *, p < 0.05; **, p <
  0.005; ***, p < 0.0005, significantly different from vehicle, control, or as indicated.'
