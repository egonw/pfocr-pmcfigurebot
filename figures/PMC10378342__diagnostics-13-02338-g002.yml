caption: 'Immunomodulatory effect of IVIg on the humoral arm of the innate immune
  system and on inflammasome. NF-κB (Nuclear factor kappa B) signaling pathway is
  activated by the binding of ligands to PRR, TNFR, and IL-1R. Activation of this
  cascade leads to activation of kinase (IKK), which causes phosphorylation IkB-α,
  which releases NF-κB, which then translocates to the nucleus and regulates gene
  transcription of various cytokines, including NLRP3 (priming signal). The activation
  signal for inflammasome activation comes from either the binding of PAMPs/DAMPs
  onto PRRs or the damage signal from mitochondria. Upon activation, the NLRP3 complex
  assembles, causing the conversion of procaspase to active caspase and IL-1B and
  IL-18. IVIg inhibits the pathway at various steps, as indicated by dotted lines.
  PRR: patterned recognition receptor; TNFR: tumor necrosis factor receptor; IL-1R:
  interleukin-1 receptor; PAMPs: pathogen-associated molecular patterns; DAMPs: damage-associated
  molecular pattern; IVIg: intravenous immunoglobulin.'
