caption: Network representation of the impact of senescence on VEGF, BMP and TENASCIN
  intercellular communication in the RPE/choroid. Signaling network summary between
  senescent-like and non-senescent cell types for (A) VEGF, (B) BMP and (C) TENASCIN
  pathways. Cell type to cell type networks (top panels) and heatmaps (middle panels)
  show the CellChat communication probability (aggregated over all LRIs from the given
  pathway) between each cell type pair. Centrality heatmaps (bottom panels) show the
  various CellChat centrality scores across each cell type for the selected pathways.
article_title: Intercellular communication analysis of the human retinal pigment epithelial
  and choroidal cells predicts pathways associated with aging, cellular senescence
  and age-related macular degeneration.
