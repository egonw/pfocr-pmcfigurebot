caption: 'The terminal regulation mechanism of jasmonic acid (JA) signaling: (A) the
  dynamic banlance of JAs. Metabolic and catabolic enzymes maintain a dynamic balance
  between JA and JA-Ile. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) is formed by JA catalyzed by jasmonic
  acid carboxyl methyltransferase (JMT). JAR1 transforms JA into JA-Ile. JA-Ile is
  continuously oxidized twice by CYP94 P450 family enzymes to generate 12-OH-JA-Ile
  and 12-COOH-JA-Ile in turn. The amide bond of JA-Ile/12-OH-JA-Ile is broken by amide
  hydrolases (IAR3/ILL5/ILL6) to generate JA/12-OH-JA, respectively. JA can be directly
  hydroxylated to 12-OH-JA and further sulfated to form 12-HSO4-JA; (B) COI1 degradation
  pattern. Jasmonate receptor COI1 forms the SCFCOI1 complex with ASK1 and CUL1. Excessive
  COI1 protein is recruited and degraded by ubiquitination through the 26S proteasome
  pathway; (C) the inert and alternative splicing of JAZ-mediated JA attenuation pattern.
  JA signal suppressor JAZ protein can bind to NINJA protein and directly or indirectly
  recruit co-inhibitor TPL to inhibit the transcription of MYC2, thereby inhibiting
  the expression of JA-responsive genes. Inert JAZs (JAZ7, JAZ8, and JAZ13) have a
  conserved EAR domain that directly interacts with TPL. JAZ10.4, a variable splice
  of JAZ10, lacks the Jas motif and mediates desensitization to JA. MED25-recruited
  splicing factors PRP39a and PRP40a promote the correct splicing of JAZ genes and
  prevent the overproduction of splicing variants, thereby regulating the activation
  of JA signal; (D) bHLH-like protein-mediated JA attenuation pattern. bHLH IIId (JAM1/2/3,
  bHLH14) proteins compete with MYC-like TFs to bind the G-box element on the promoter
  of the JA response gene, inhibit the formation of the MYC2-MED25 complex, and negatively
  regulate the JA response. Arrows: activations; bar-headed arrows: repressions.'
