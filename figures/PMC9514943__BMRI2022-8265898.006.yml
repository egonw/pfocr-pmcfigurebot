caption: 'The effects of PD on downstream signaling targets of PAR1. (a) The effect
  of PD on the cAMP concentration of human washed platelets. (b) VP increased the
  cAMP content of human platelets treated with PD. (c) The expression of the protein
  by Western blot. (d) The effect of PD on phosphorylation levels of PI3K, Akt, and
  GSK3β in human platelets. (e) VP inhibited the phosphorylation levels of PI3K, Akt,
  and GSK3β of platelets treated with PD. The data are expressed as mean ± SD (n =
  3). ∗p < 0.05 compared to the PD group; ##p < 0.01 compared to the thrombin group;
  &p < 0.05, &&p < 0.01, and &&&p < 0.001 compared to the vehicle group.'
