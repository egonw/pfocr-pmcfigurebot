caption: 'CSPGs inhibit neuronal differentiation of human drNPC-O2 by suppressing
  Wnt/β-catenin pathway that can be reversed by co-blockage of LAR and PTPσ receptors
  in vitro. A, B, Role of Wnt/β-catenin pathway in neuronal differentiation of drNPC-O2
  on laminin and laminin+CSPGs was studied using Wnt-specific inhibitor (IWR01) and
  activator (CHRI99021). A, Representative images of β-tubulin-III immunocytochemistry
  are depicted for differentiated drNPC-O2 on laminin and/or CSPGs under ILP/ISP,
  CHIR99021, and IWR01 treatments. B, Immunocytochemical quantification of drNPC-O2
  showed that inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by IWR01 blocked neurogenesis
  of drNPC-O2 on laminin control condition, suggesting the importance of this pathway
  for neuronal differentiation of drNPC-O2. CHIR99021 was also sufficient to restore
  the inhibitory effects of CSPGs on neuronal differentiation by activating Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway. C, Representative images of GFAP immunocytochemistry for assessing
  astrocyte differentiation of drNPC-O2 on laminin and/or CSPGs under ILP/ISP, CHIR99021,
  and IWR01 treatments. D, Activation of Wnt/β-catenin by CHRI99021 decreases astrocyte
  differentiation of drNPC-O2 on CSPGs, while blocking Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
  by IWR01 increases astrogenesis on laminin. E, Representative immunostaining images
  show expression of β-catenin and β-tubulin-III in drNPC-O2-derived neurons under
  various conditions. F, Analysis of β-catenin nuclear translocation revealed that
  inhibiting LAR and PTPσ receptor by ILP/ISP can significantly enhance Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway activity in neurons exposed to CSPGs similar to treatment with CHRI99021.
