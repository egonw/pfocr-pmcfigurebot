caption: C57BL/6 mouse lenses showed progressive increase of ROS accumulation with
  a significant decline in Bmal1, Nrf2 and its target antioxidant genes expression
  during aging. (A) Intracellular ROS of lenses of different ages were quantified
  using H2-DCF-DA dye as described in Materials and Methods and as indicated in figure.
  Data represents the mean ± S.D. from three independent experiments. Young [6 months
  (M)] vs. aging (16 M and 22 M) samples. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.001. (B–L) Total RNA
  was extracted from lenses of different ages and transcribed cDNA was submitted to
  real-time PCR analysis with specific primers corresponding molecules as indicated.
  Data represents the mean ± S.D. from three independent experiments. Young (6 M)
  vs. aging (16 M and 22 M) samples. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.001.
