caption: Effects of cSPX-14 and cGAL-29 (10−11-10−5 M, 6 h) on activation of the intracellular
  MAPK/ERK signaling pathway in HEK293 cells expressing cGALR1 (A), cGALR1L (B), cGALR2
  (C), cGALR2L (D) and cGALR3 (E), monitored by pGL4-SRE-luciferase reporter system.
  Co-transfection of the pGL4-SRE-luciferase reporter construct and empty pcDNA3.1(+)
  vector was used as an internal control (F). Each data point represents the mean
  ± SEM of three replicates (N = 3).
