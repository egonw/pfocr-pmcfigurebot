caption: 'Melanoma‐derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) regulate CXCL1 expression
  and the proangiogenic capability of cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs) through
  the IKK/IκB/NF‐κB signaling pathway. A, B, P‐IKKα/β, p‐IκBα, NF‐κB, and CXCL1 levels
  were upregulated in HFF‐1 cells after sEV treatment and downregulated by APDC. GAPDH
  was used as the internal control. C, APDC inhibited CXCL1 secretion from sEV‐treated
  HFF‐1 cells. The APDC treatment significantly reduced the promoting effects of the
  conditioned medium (CM) from sEV‐treated HFF‐1 cells on HUVEC proliferation (D),
  migration (E, F), and tube formation (E, G). N, normoxic; H, hypoxic. Scale bar:
  50 μm. Independent experiments were performed in triplicate. **P < .01, ***P < .001,
  Student''s t tests. Values represent means ±SEM'
