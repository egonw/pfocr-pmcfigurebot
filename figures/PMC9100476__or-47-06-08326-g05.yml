caption: ICA can affect the migration and invasion ability of cancer cells and regulate
  the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway through the miR-205-5p/PTEN axis. (A) Invasive ability
  and (B) migratory ability of cells in each group were detected by Transwell assay;
  magnification, ×100. (C) Western blotting detected the expression of PI3K/Akt pathway-related
  proteins in transfected cells. Data represented as the mean ± SD of three experiments;
  *P<0.05. ICA, icariin; miR, microRNA; PTEN, Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted
  on chromosome ten; p-, phosphorylated.
article_title: Icariin inhibits the malignant progression of lung cancer by affecting
  the PI3K/Akt pathway through the miR-205-5p/PTEN axis.
