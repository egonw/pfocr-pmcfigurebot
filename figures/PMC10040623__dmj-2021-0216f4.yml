caption: MiR-328-3p induces insulin resistance by disrupting the sterol regulatory
  element binding protein 2 (SREBP-2)-mediated extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  (ERK) signaling pathway inactivation in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) mice.
  GDM mice were injected with nanoparticles (NPs) expressing miR-328-3pmimic, overexpression
  (oe)-SREBP-2 or both. (A) Fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels (mmol/L) at different
  periods of gestation in GDM mice. (B) Levels of fasting insulin (FINS) and homeostasis
  model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) at day 18 of gestation in GDM mice.
  (C) Glucose area under the curve at different gestational time points in GDM mice.
  (D) Apoptosis of cells in islet tissues of GDM mice detected using terminal deoxynucleotidyl
  transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining. (E) Western
  blot analysis of SREBP-2 and Ras proteins, and ERK phosphorylation level in islet
  tissues of GDM mice. (F) Immunohistochemistry analysis of SREBP-2- and p-ERK-positive
  cells in islet tissues of GDM mice. (G) The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase
  (HMGCR) mRNA expression in pancreatic islet tissue of pregnant mice determined by
  reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. NC, negative control;
  OGTT, oral glucose tolerance test. aP<0.05 vs. GDM mice injected with NPs expressing
  NC inhibitor, bP<0.05 vs. GDM mice injected with NPs expressing NC mimic+oe-SREBP-2
  (n=10 for mice following each treatment).
