caption: 'Expressions of stemness markers in HCT-116 and HT-29 after S7333 treatment.
  The results of flow cytometry analysis show the stemness surface markers CD133,
  CD44, and CD24 in HCT-116 and HT-29 cells after S7333 treatment (A). For HCT-116
  cells, CD133 expression increased while CD44 expression decreased and CD24 remained
  almost the same. For HT-29 cells, CD44 increased while CD24 decreased and CD133
  remained the same (A). (B) shows the summary of the flow cytometry results with
  3 repeated experiments. (C), Real-time q-PCR results, show that the stem genes CD133
  and Lgr5 significantly increase while the self-renewal gene TGF-Î²1 slightly increases
  after S7333 treatment. The ability of cell proliferation decreases as indicated
  by low Ki67 gene expression and K-Ras gene has been suppressed by S7333 treatment.
