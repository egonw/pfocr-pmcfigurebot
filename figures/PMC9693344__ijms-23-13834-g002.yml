caption: The regulatory effect of isothiocyanates on Keap1-Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway.
  Under normal conditions, Nrf2 is anchored into the cytoplasm by binding to Keap1,
  which facilitates the proteasomal degradation by ubiquitination. Under the action
  of the chemoprotective inducers ITCs, nascent Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus due
  to binding of ITCs to the sulfhydryl group of Keap1, and then binds to antioxidant
  response element (ARE) sequences in the nucleus, promoting the expression of genes
  and enzymes that regulate redox homeostasis. Red, purple, yellow, and light green
  ellipses represent ITCs, Nrf2, PBX1, and ub, while orange, dark green, blue, and
  red boxes represent Gulins3, Keap1, ARE, and sMaf, respectively. ub, ubiquitination;
  sMaf, small Maf proteins.
