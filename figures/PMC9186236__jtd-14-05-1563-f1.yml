caption: 'SOST was significantly elevated in patients with cardiac remodeling after
  MI. (A) The mRNA expression of SOST in the serum of patients with post-MI cardiac
  remodeling was detected by qRT-PCR. (B) Western blot analysis was performed to assess
  the protein expression of SOST, with GAPDH as an internal control. (C) ELISA was
  conducted to detect the expression of SOST. The data are presented as mean ± SD.
  **P<0.01, NCRMI group vs. control group; ##P<0.01, CRMI group vs. NCRMI group. MI,
  myocardial infarction; SOST, sclerostin; CRMI, cardiac remodeling after MI; NCRMI,
  no cardiac remodeling after MI; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction; ELISA, enzyme-linked
  immunosorbent assay; SD, standard deviation.'
