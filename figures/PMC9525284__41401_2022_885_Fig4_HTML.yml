figure_title: Dapa targets NHE1 hence regulating MAPK/AP-1 pathway to protect cardiomyocytes
caption: a Direct binding of Dapa and NHE1 protein was shown by SPR assay. Ka binding
  constant, Kd dissociation constant, KD equilibrium dissociation constant. b Molecular
  docking of Dapa with NHE1. c–h H9c2 cells were transfected with NHE1 siRNA or HA-NHE1
  plasmid, and were then treated with Dapa and PA. Cell lysates from knockdown (c)
  or overexpression (d) assay were collected and proteins of p-ERK, p-JNK, and p-p38
  were detected with total proteins as loading control. H9c2 cells after knockdown
  of NHE1 were stained with rhodamine-phalloidin (e) or TUNEL kit (f), and counterstained
  with DAPI. Representative images were shown. g, h H9c2 cells after overexpression
  of NHE1 were stained with TUNEL kit, and counterstained with DAPI (e, g, scale bar = 50 μm;
  f, h, scale bar = 100 μm). Representative images were shown. n = 3; Means ± SEM;
  One-way ANOVA followed by Turkey post-hoc tests.
