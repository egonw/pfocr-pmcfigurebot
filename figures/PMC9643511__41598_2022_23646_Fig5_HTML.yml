caption: The possible molecular targets of GSC populations. (A) Dotplot enrichment
  map of differentially expressed genes of mt-GSCs compared to wt-GSCs. The size of
  sphere reflected the number of significantly changed genes, the sphere color displayed
  the significance of the changes occurred in the corresponding metabolic pathway.
  (B) Barplot showing the composition of UMAP GSC clusters annotated using normal
  fetal brain single cell data. Each bar shows the proportion of cells (%) assigned
  as normal fetal brain cells annotated in color bar on the right side. (C) Dotplot
  enrichment map of differentially expressed genes comparing UMAP GSC clusters to
  normal fetal brain cell clusters which were presented in our dataset. The size of
  sphere reflected the number of significantly changed genes, the sphere color displayed
  the significance of the changes occurred in the corresponding metabolic pathway.
  (D) Dotplot enrichment map of differentially expressed genes comparing low-grade
  samples to high-grade samples within our dataset irrespective of the mutations.
  The size of sphere reflected the number of significantly changed genes, the sphere
  color displayed the significance of the changes occurred in the corresponding metabolic
  pathway. (E) Possible adjuvant therapeutic approaches for each GSC populations according
  to their molecular profile. Molecular markers of the GSC populations are listed
  in the bar in the lower part. Small arrows annotate the differentiation path. Big
  arrows annotate the suggested therapeutic approaches.
