caption: The suppressive effects of patchouli alcohol (PA) on D-gal-induced chondrocyte
  senescence via upregulating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. (a–c) Impact of PA on mRNA
  expression of collagen 2a1 (Col2a1), matrix metalloproteinase 13 (Mmp13), Tp53,
  Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 1A (Cdkn1a/p21Cip1/Waf1), catalase (Cat), and
  superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1) in D-gal-caused senescent chondrocytes was detected
  by RT-qPCR. (d) Effect of PA on cell viability and cytotoxicity was determined by
  CCK-8 assay. (e) PA's influence upon antioxidant indices (CAT and SOD) generation
  by D-gal-induced senescent chondrocytes was determined by biochemical kit. (f) Representative
  images of alcian blue, safranin O, and SA-β-gal staining in aging chondrocytes.
  The scale bar of alcian blue and safranin O staining, 250 μm. The scale bar of SA-β-gal
  staining, 100 μm. (g) Representative fluorescent images of ROS levels in D-gal (5 mg/ml)
  induced senescent chondrocytes. Scale bar, 50 μm. (h and i) The immunofluorescence
  detection of MMP13 and TP53 in D-gal-caused senescent chondrocytes. Scale bar, 50 μm.
  (j) The expression and quantitative analysis of COL2A1, MMP13, nuclear factor-erythroid
  2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), TP53, and p21 proteins were
  assessed through western blotting. The Nrf2 protein expression level is the gray
  value ratio of the target protein to lamin B, while other proteins were the grayscale
  ratio of target protein to β-actin. Mean ± SEM. ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. corresponding
  group.
