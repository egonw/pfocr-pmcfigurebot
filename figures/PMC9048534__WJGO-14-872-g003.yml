caption: 'SMMC-7721 cell apoptosis is induced by Xihuang pills extract. SMMC-7721
  cells were stained with annexin V/propidium iodide and fluorescein isothiocyanate
  after treatment with or without 0.625 mg/mL Xihuang pills (XHP) extract for 12 h.
  A and B: Flow cytometry was used to detect the number of apoptotic cells (A) and
  the cell cycle distribution (B); C: Cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-9 protein
  expression levels were detected by Western blotting, and caspase-3 and caspase-9
  mRNA expression levels were detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction
  (RT–qPCR); D: After treating SMMC-7721 cells with different concentrations of the
  XHP extract, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-9 protein expression levels were
  determined using Western blotting, whereas caspase-3 and caspase-9 mRNA expression
  levels were determined using RT–qPCR. The experiment was repeated three times, and
  the data are presented as the means ± SD. aP < 0.05 and bP < 0.01 compared with
  the control group; cP < 0.05 and dP < 0.01 compared with the XHP 0.625 group; eP
  < 0.05 and fP < 0.01 compared with the XHP 1.25 group.'
