caption: The KEGG enrichment analysis revealed the pathways of protein synthesis and
  transport were mainly activated in Taihe silky fowl. (A) The KEGG pathway enrichment
  analysis of differential metabolites in Taihe silky fowl compared with the black-feathered
  chicken. (Bâ€“E) Hierarchical clustering analysis of differential metabolites in ABC
  transporters, biosynthesis of amino acids, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, and glycine,
  serine, and threonine metabolism, respectively.
