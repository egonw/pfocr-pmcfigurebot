caption: Signaling pathway of the Tie2 receptor. Upon binding of Ang1, the Tie2 receptor
  is auto-phosphorylated and activated. The activated Tie2 receptor then stimulates
  a number of intracellular signaling cascades, in particular the phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. This pathway leads to activation of the GTPase RAC1 and
  subsequent inhibition of the GTPase RhoA, via the transducer molecule p190RhoGAP.
  RAC1 and RhoA then act jointly to induce a reorganization of the cytoskeleton and
  accumulation of VE-cadherin at adherens junctions. These concerted actions ultimately
  impede both de novo blood vessel growth and vascular hyperpermeability. Tie2 activation
  also causes recruitment of ABIN-2 (A20-binding inhibitor of NFkB-2), which suppresses
  NFkB activity and protects endothelial cells from apoptosis. The protein tyrosine
  phosphatase VE-PTP acts as a negative regulator of Tie2 signaling
