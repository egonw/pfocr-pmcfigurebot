caption: Gene expression profiling for AAA versus control mice (C57BL/6J ApoE −/−).
  (a, b) Hierarchical clustering of differential expression level (Log2 fold) showing
  consistent pattern changes for repeated samples of AAA versus control mice. (c)
  Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealing the up‐regulated and major meaningful
  gene in biological process for AAA mice versus the controls. (d) KEGG analysis showing
  functional enrichment or suppressed pathway for induced AAA. (e) Log2 fold changes
  for selected genes corresponding to indicated functional molecules or signalling
  pathways (AAA versus controls)
