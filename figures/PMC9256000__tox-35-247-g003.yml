caption: Pathway analysis with RNA expression changes in the lungs of smoke-exposed
  mice. Software-assisted identification of putative biological networks affected
  by smoke exposure, as revealed by IPA. Differentially-expressed RNA genes showing
  a +/âˆ’ 1.5-fold change or greater were selected and entered into IPA software to
  illustrate potential interactions. Solid arrows represent known physical interactions,
  dotted arrows represent indirect interactions. Red- or green-colored shapes indicate
  up- or down-regulated genes in the lungs of smoke-exposed mice. IPA, Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis.
