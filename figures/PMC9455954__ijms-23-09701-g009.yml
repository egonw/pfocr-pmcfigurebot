caption: DEGs in the 323F3C vs. 323F3S and P300C vs. P300S comparisons annotated in
  the hormone synthesis and signaling transduction pathways by KEGG analysis. The
  main synthesis and signal transduction pathway of Auxin/IAA, JA, ABA, and ETH are
  shown in (Aâ€“D), respectively. Log2 (read counts + 1) of each gene in different samples
  are shown in the appropriate grid. Heat-maps were drawn using Tbtools software [].
