caption: Uromodulin regulates salt reabsorption via NKCC2 (Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter).
  Two mechanistic approaches studied through preclinical models show that uromodulin
  regulates NKCC2 (Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter) via activation (phosphorylation) of
  SPAK (STE20/SPS1–related proline/alanine-rich kinase) and OSR1 (oxidative stress
  response 1 kinase), and inhibition of TNF (tumor necrosis factor)-alpha. The red
  and green dotted arrow represents indirect signaling pathway for inhibition and
  activation, respectively.
