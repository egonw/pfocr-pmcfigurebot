caption: Model of inhibition of IL-10 signaling by TNFα in human monocytes. Stimulation
  of human monocytes by TNFα induces phosphorylation of p47PHOX on Ser345, Ser328
  and to a lesser extent Ser315 leading to ROS production by NOX2. NOX2-derived ROS
  switch on Lyn activity by inducing its oxidation. Active Lyn then induces the phosphorylation
  of SHP-1 on Tyr564 thus promoting its activation. Active SHP-1 then dephosphorylates
  IL-10-activated STAT3.
