caption: SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 promotes aerobic glycolysis and de novo purine synthesis.
  (A) RelA wild-type, RelA-DD, and RelA-N64A knock-in MEFs expressing hACE2 were infected
  with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI = 0.1) for 24 h. Indicated genes were analyzed by real-time
  PCR. (B) A heatmap showing the abundance of metabolites of indicated pathways in
  SARS-CoV-2–infected Caco-2 cells (MOI = 0.1 or 1). (C) Diagram of [U-13C]glucose
  tracing for the glycolysis pathway, PPP, and purine de novo synthesis pathway. (D)
  Caco-2 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI = 1) for 96 h, followed by labeling
  with [U-13C]glucose for 1 h. Indicated metabolites were determined by LC-MS. (E)
  Control or CAD-knockdown Caco-2 cells were infected with control lentivirus or that
  carrying Nsp9. At 96 hpi, cells were traced with [U-13C]glucose for 5 min (G6P)
  or 2 h (ADP, GDP, and GMP) and harvested for metabolite determination by LC-MS.
  Data are presented as means ± SD of biological triplicates. Statistical analysis
  was performed by the one-way ANOVA test or unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t test.
  *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
