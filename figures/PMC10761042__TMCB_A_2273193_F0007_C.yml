caption: 'Activated Cdk3 bypasses requirement for PTP1B for proliferation and cell
  cycle progression. (A) GB cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding a constitutively
  active Cdk3 mutant. The presence of Cdk3 AF in cell extracts was verified by Western
  blot using anti-HA antibodies. (B) GB cells were mock transfected or transfected
  with a plasmid encoding a constitutively active Cdk3 mutant and incubated 3 h with
  vehicle, claramine 2 µM or trodusquemine 2 µM. Cells were counted every 24 h. Proliferation
  of LN229, U87-MG and U251 cells is represented as mean ± SE of three independent
  experiments. (C) GB cells were mock transfected or transfected with a plasmid encoding
  a constitutively active Cdk3 mutant, synchronized at G0 and incubated 3 h with vehicle,
  claramine 2 µM or trodusquemine 2 µM as previously described. Cell cycle arrest
  was released by the addition of 10% FBS, cells were fixed at indicated time points
  and stained with propidium iodide. Quantification of the percentage of cells at
  each phase is represented in the bar graphics. Statistical differences between control
  and experimental groups of cells are indicated (*P < 0.05). Data are representative
  of three independent experiments. (D) GB cells were mock transfected or transfected
  with a plasmid encoding a constitutively active Cdk3 mutant, synchronized at G0
  and incubated 3 h with vehicle, claramine 2 µM or trodusquemine 2 µM as previously
  mentioned. Cell cycle arrest was released by the addition of 10% FBS. The expression
  levels of the E2F target genes: Cdk1, cyclin A, and cyclin E1 were assessed by RT-qPCR.
  All data were normalized to control GAPDH. Fold changes were calculated using the
  ΔCt method (2-ΔΔCt). Data are representative of three independent experiments.'
