figure_title: FAK inhibitor protects against LPS-induced inflammatory response in
  mice
caption: 'A Representative H&E-stained sections of lung tissues harvested from mice
  following LPS challenge [scale bar = 100 μm]. B Lung injury scores were assessed
  from histological analyses of mouse lung tissues [Mean ± SEM, n = 8; *P < 0.05 compared
  to Ctrl; #P < 0.05 compared to LPS]. C Lung wet/dry ratio was determined at 6 h
  after LPS challenge. [Mean ± SEM, n = 8; *P < 0.05 compared to Ctrl; #P < 0.05 compared
  to LPS]. D BALF was collected 6 h after LPS challenge and the amounts of proteins
  were measured. [Mean ± SEM, n = 8; *P < 0.05 compared to Ctrl; #P < 0.05 compared
  to LPS]. E, F Levels of IL-6 (E) and TNF-α (F) in BALF samples. [Mean ± SEM, n = 8;
  **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001 compared to Ctrl; #P < 0.05 compared to LPS]. G, H Levels
  of IL-6 (G) and TNF-α (H) in serum samples of mice [Mean ± SEM. N = 8; ***P < 0.001
  compared to Ctrl; #P < 0.05 compared to LPS]. I Mice were challenged with intratracheal
  LPS and treated with PND-1186. Lung tissues were stained for inflammation marker
  p-p65 (green). Slides were counterstained with DAPI (blue) [scale bar = 100 μm].
  J Protein levels of p-FAK, p-TAK1 and IκBα in mouse lung tissues challenged with
  intratracheal LPS. Total FAK, TAK, and GAPDH were used as control. K Complexes of
  FAK-TAK1 in mouse lung tissues challenged with intratracheal LPS were detected by
  immunoprecipitation.'
