caption: 'SOST inhibited angiogenesis of CMECs and promoted the proliferation and
  migration of CFs. (A) The mRNA expression of SOST in cells transfected with the
  SOST overexpression vector and cells transfected with the sh-SOST vector was detected
  using qRT-PCR. GAPDH was used as the normalization control. (B) The protein expression
  of SOST in cells transfected with the SOST overexpression vector and cells transfected
  with the sh-SOST vector was detected with Western blot. GAPDH was used as the normalization
  control. (C) The tube formation and number of capillary-like structures in cells
  overexpressing SOST and cells transfected with the sh-SOST vector. (D) CCK-8 assay
  to detect the cell viability of CFs when overexpressing or suppressing SOST at 24,
  48 and 72 h, respectively. (E) The cell cycle of CFs was detected by flow cytometry
  in cells overexpressing SOST and cells with suppressed SOST expression. (F) CFs
  were stained with propidium iodide. The migration ability of CFs was detected using
  the Transwell assay. The data are presented as mean ± SD. **P<0.01, SOST-overexpression
  group vs. control group; ##P<0.01, sh-SOST group vs. control group. SOST, sclerostin;
  sh, short hairpin; CMEC, cardiac microvascular endothelial cell; CF, cardiac fibroblast;
  qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate dehydrogenase; CCK-8, cell counting kit 8; SD, standard deviation.'
