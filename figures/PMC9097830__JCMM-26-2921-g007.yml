caption: NAA10 is associated with RelA/p65 and influences the phosphorylation of p65.
  (A) Immunoprecipitation of NAA10 and RelA/p65 with an anti‐RelA/p65 antibody in
  CAL 27 and SCC‐15 cells. IgG H, IgG heavy chain; IgG L, IgG light chain. (B) Protein
  interaction of NAA10 with RelA/p65 proteins in vitro. V5–NAA10 and His–p65 were
  cotransfected in 293T cells, and reciprocal immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting
  were carried out with the indicated antibodies. (C) Cytoplasmic and nuclear interactions
  between NAA10 and RelA/p65. Indicated cells were subjected to subcellular fractionation,
  and the qualities of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were, respectively, verified
  by Western blot with antibodies against β‐actin and H3. Cytoplasmic protein (500 µg)
  and nuclear protein (200 µg) were immunoprecipitated with an anti‐p65 antibody,
  followed by Western blot with anti‐NAA10 and anti‐RelA/p65 antibodies. (D) Binding
  assay of His‐p65 with GST or GST‐NAA10. (E) Colocalization of NAA10 and RelA/p65.
  CAL 27 and SCC‐15 cells were subjected to immunofluorescence staining with anti‐NAA10
  (green) and anti‐RelA/p65 (red) antibodies. Colocalization was shown by the merge
  (yellow). Nuclei were counterstained with 4’,6‐diamidino‐2‐phenylindole (DAPI) (blue).
  (F) shCon and shNAA10 were transfected into CAL 27 and SCC‐15 cells, respectively.
  The endogenous level of p65 and p‐p65 (Ser536) was detected by Western blot. All
  experiments were carried out in triplicate
