caption: MTERF1 regulates the p-AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway in CRC cells. (A) Upregulation
  of MTERF1 inhibited AMPK phosphorylation and promoted mTOR phosphorylation levels,
  yet downregulation of MTERF1 had the opposite effect. Data represent the mean ±
  SD from at least three independent biological replicates. (B) HT29 cells overexpressing
  MTERF1 were treated with 0–20 μM oligomycin A and 150–300 nM rapamycin, and the
  AMPK/mTOR pathway regulated by MTERF1 was blocked by oligomycin and rapamycin.
