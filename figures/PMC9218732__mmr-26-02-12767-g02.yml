caption: Circ_0006174 is the molecular sponge of miR-1205. (A) RT-qPCR was conducted
  to determine circ_0006174 expression in the cytoplasm and nucleus of CRC cells.
  RT-qPCR was applied to determine miR-1205 expression in SW620 and SW480 cells transfected
  with (B) miR-1205 mimics or (C) miR-1205 inhibitor. (D) RT-qPCR was applied to determine
  miR-1205 expression in 68 cases of CRC tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissue.
  (E) RT-qPCR was performed to detect miR-1205 expression in normal human colonic
  epithelial cell line and CRC cell lines (HCT116, SW620, SW480 and HT29). (F) The
  putative binding site of circ_0006174 for miR-1205 (circ_00061747-WT) and the designed
  mutant sequence (circ_0006174-MUT) were shown. (G and H) The dual-luciferase reporter
  gene experiment was performed to validate the direct binding between circ_0006174
  and miR-1205. (I) Pearson's correlation coefficient was utilized to analyze the
  relationship between miR-1205 expression and circ_0006174 expression in CRC tissue.
  (J) RT-qPCR was performed to examine miR-1205 expression in CRC cell line transfected
  with circ_0006174 siRNA. **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001. circ, circular RNA; miR, microRNA;
