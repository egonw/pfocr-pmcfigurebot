caption: Associations of LTBP2 expression with clinicopathological features and pan-cancer
  analysis. (A and B) Boxplots revealed that LTBP2 was under-expressed in tumor tissues
  compared with normal control tissues in (A) TCGA-PRAD dataset and (B) TCGA combined
  with GTEx dataset. (C-E) Boxplot indicating LTBP2 expression in different (C) Gleason-score,
  (D) AJCC T stage, (E) PSA-value of PCa samples from TCGA-PRAD dataset. (F) The ROC
  curves revealed the efficiency of LTBP2 expression levels to distinguish PCa tissues
  from normal prostate tissues. (G and H) Boxplots displaying the LTBP2 expression
  using pan-cancer analysis. (I and J) Boxplot indicating LTBP2 expression in various
  clinicopathological features using pan-cancer analysis. Subgroup comparison between
  different tumors in G-I were demonstrated using *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001.
