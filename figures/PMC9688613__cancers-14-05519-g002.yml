caption: CLEFMA increased the sub-G1 phase ratio in human OSCC. (A) HSC-3 and SCC-9
  cells were incubated with CLEFMA at indicated concentrations for 24 h and then incubated
  with a PI buffer. After staining, the cells were subjected to cell cycle distribution
  analysis via flow cytometry. The quantification results of the cell cycle population
  of (B) HSC-3 and (C) SCC-9 cells are shown in the bar graph. Quantification analysis
  was acquired from three independent experiments and expressed as mean Â± SD.
