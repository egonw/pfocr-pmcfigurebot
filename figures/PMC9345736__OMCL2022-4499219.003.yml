caption: Inhibition of CTSB with CA-074Me reduced acinar cell necroptosis in vitro.
  Isolated PACs were pretreated with CA-074Me (10 μM) for 0.5 h and then stimulated
  with 200 nM CCK for 6 h. Cell injury assessed by (a) the percentage of ATP depletion
  (n=6 per group), (b) LDH leakage (n=4 per group), and (c) Hoechst/PI staining (n=4
  per group, scale bar 200 μm). (d) Quantification of PI-positive cell (n=4 per group).
  (e, f) Immunoblot analysis and quantification of RIP3, p-MLKL, and MLKL proteins
  of CCK-stimulated PACs with or without CA-074Me (10 μM). N=4 per group. ∗P < 0.05,
  ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
