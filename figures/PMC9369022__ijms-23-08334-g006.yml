caption: SF modulates the NF-κB signaling pathway. Human osteoarthritic (OA) chondrocytes
  were incubated for 3 h with 50% and 100% SF derived from patients with OA, rheumatoid
  arthritis (RA), or controls. (A,B) Expression levels of p50 and p65 subunits analyzed
  by quantitative real-time PCR. The gene expression was referenced to the ratio of
  the value of interest and the value of the basal condition, reported equal to 1.
  Data were represented as mean ± SD of triplicate values. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001 versus basal condition. ° p < 0.05, °° p < 0.01 versus control SF.
