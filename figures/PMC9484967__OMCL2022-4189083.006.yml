caption: 'Western blot analysis of the Nrf2 signaling pathway. (a) After being added
  with different concentrations of 4,7-didehydro-neophysalin B, Nrf2 pathway-related
  protein expression in RLE-6TN cells and its quantitative band intensity analysis.
  (b) Effect of 4,7-didehydro-neophysalin B on the expression of Nrf2 pathway-related
  proteins and the quantitative band intensity analysis. (c) Expression of Nrf2 protein
  in the nucleus and its quantitative band intensity analysis. Compared with the blank
  group, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001. Compared with the H2O2+0% 4,7-didehydro-neophysalin
  B group, #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, and ###p < 0.001.'
