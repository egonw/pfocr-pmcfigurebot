caption: Atractylodin facilitated the nuclear translocation of Nrf2, thereby upregulated
  the antioxidant enzyme expression in L. monocytogenes infected macrophages. (A,
  B) Western blot analysis of effects of atractylodin on the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling
  pathway during L. monocytogenes infection. Nuclear and cytoplasmic protein from
  J774A.1 cells were prepared and analyzed by western blotting for the assessment
  of the nuclear translocation of Nrf2. (C, D) The levels of Nrf2-targeted typical
  phase 2 detoxifying enzyme NQO1 and the stress response protein HO-1 in J774A.1
  cells infected with wildtype L. monocytogenes strain EGD and the hly-deficient mutant
  EGDΔhly in the presence or absence of atractylodin. (B, D) The levels of Cyto-Nrf2,
  Keap1, NQO1 and HO-1 relative to β-actin and Nucl-Nrf2 relative to Lamin B determined
  using densitometry were shown. Data are represented as the mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05
  and **P < 0.01 vs the EGD-infection group; ++P < 0.01 vs the EGDΔhly-infection group.
