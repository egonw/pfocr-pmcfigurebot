caption: 'Huangqin decoction suppresses hepatic inflammation and insulin resistance
  in high-fat diet-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease rats. Data are presented
  as mean ± SD (n = 4–8). aP < 0.01 vs the normal group, bP < 0.05 and cP < 0.01 vs
  the high-fat diet (HFD) group. A: Representative images of immunohistochemical staining
  of interleukin (IL)-1β in liver sections; B: Quantitative analysis of staining intensity
  of IL-1β; C-E: Levels of IL-6 (C), IL-1β (D), and tumor necrosis factor-α (E) in
  the liver of HFD-fed rats; F: Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT); G: Area under
  the curve from OGTT; H: Level of fasting serum insulin; I: Values of homeostasis
  model assessment of insulin resistance. AUC: Area under the curve; Fen: Fenofibrate;
  HFD: High-fat diet; HOMA-IR: Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance;
  HQD: Huangqin decoction; IL: Interleukin; TNF: Tumor necrosis factor.'

  resistance in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease by triggering Sirt1/NF-κB pathway.
