caption: The cytotoxicity of TM in ovarian granulosa cells. (A) Cell viability determined
  by the CCK8 analysis. (B, C) Representative flow cytometric analyses of Annexin
  V and PI staining treated with TM. (D) Apoptosis percentage of granulosa cells treated
  with TM. (E, F) ROS production detected by DCFH-DA. (G) Fluoresce intensity of granulosa
  cells treated with TM. (H–L) The mRNA expression of Grp78, ATF4, CHOP, PERK, and
  eIF-2α. All the experiments were repeated for 3 times and all values are means ±
  SE. *P < 0.05, ⁎⁎P < 0.01, ⁎⁎⁎P < 0.001.
