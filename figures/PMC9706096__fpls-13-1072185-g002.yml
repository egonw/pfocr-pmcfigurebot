caption: Anthocyanin-related gene expression analysis in the process of yellowhorn
  flower color change. (A) The flavonoid biosynthetic pathway relevant to flower color
  change in X. sorbifolium. RT-PCR analysis of expression profiles of the ABP structural
  genes during flower color change at S1 to S4. PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase;
  C4H, cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate Co-A ligase; CHS, chalcone synthase;
  CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3′H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase;
  F3′5′H, flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin
  synthase; 3GT, UDP-glucose:anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosyltransferase; 5GT, UDP-glucose:anthocyanidin
  5-O-glucosyltransferase; OMT, anthocyanin O-methyltransferase. The samples at each
  developmental stage were repeated for 3 times. ABP, anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway.
  (B) The phylogenetic tree of the anthocyanin-related R2R3-MYB genes have been reported
  in different species. Arabidopsis thaliana, Vitis vinifera, Citrus clementina, Populus
  trichocarpa, Malus domestica, Citrus sinensis, Solanum lycopersicum and X. sorbifolium.
  The tree was constructed using Maximum Likelihood method by MEGA 7 with 1,000 bootstrap
  replicates. (C) qRT-PCR was used to detect the transcript abundances of XsMYB113-1,
  XsMYB113-2, XsMYB113-3, and XsMYB113-4 during flower development stages S1 to S4.
  Data represent means ± SD of three biological replicates. P values were calculated
  based on two-sided t test. (D) Schematic diagrams of gene and protein structure
  of four XsMYB113 genes in X. sorbifolium. The dark boxes represent the exons of
  four XsMYB113 genes and solid lines represent introns of four genes. The dark gray
  and light gray boxes represent R2 domain and R3 domain respectively. +1 indicates
  the translation start site.
