caption: 'LPS induced morphological damage in c57bj/6 mice, and pulmonary edema and
  inflammation in CON, UTI, LPS, LPS + UTI groups. (A) Experimental protocols of induction
  and time course of resolution of lung inflammation post‐LPS or vehicle (CON) challenge
  in wild‐type mice. (B) Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of mouse lung tissue,
  scale: 200 μm. (C) The pathological score was assessed by H&E staining. (D) Levels
  of neutrophils in BALF. (E) Total protein concentration in BALF. (F) Lung tissue
  wet‐dry ratio. (G) Level of MPO in BALF. (H) IL‐6 levels in BALF. (I) The level
  of TGF‐β in BALF. Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation, one‐way ANOVA,
  n = 3. *P < 0.05 vs. CON Group or 0 U·mL−1 UTI group.'
