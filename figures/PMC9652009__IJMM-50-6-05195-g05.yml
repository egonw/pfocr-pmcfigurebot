caption: Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is involved in STAT1-mediated VSMC calcification.
  STAT1-overexpressing VSMCs were treated with 3 mM phosphorus for 7 days, with or
  without 100 ng/ml Dkk-1 added for the last 3 days of this period. si-STAT1 VSMCs
  were treated in the presence of 3 mM phosphorus for 7 days, with or without 5 mmol/l
  LiCl for the last 3 days of this period. (A) Expression levels of STAT1 in VSMCs
  were measured by western blot analysis. (B) Expression levels of OPN, Runx2, Wnt-3a
  and β-catenin were measured by western blot analysis. (C) Reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR analysis of OPN, Runx2, Wnt-3a and β-catenin in VSMCs. (D) Mineralization was
  examined using Alizarin Red S staining. Scale bar, 100 µm. (E) Ca content in VSMCs
  was measured. (F) ALP activity was tested. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001.
  ALP, alkaline phosphatase; Ca, calcium; Ctrl, control; NC, negative control; o/e,
  overexpression; OPN, osteopontin; Runx2, runt-related transcription factor 2; si,
  small interfering RNA; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell; Dkk-1, Dickkopf-1; LiCl,
  lithium chloride.
