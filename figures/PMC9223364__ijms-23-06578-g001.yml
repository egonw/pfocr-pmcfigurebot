caption: A hypothetical model of AGP involvement in cellulose synthesis via the 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic
  acid (ACC)-mediated pathway. AGPs may sense extracellular signals by carbohydrate
  moieties and transmit signals to some receptor kinases, thereby regulating cell
  wall formation by promoting cellulose synthesis through an ethylene-independent
  ACC pathway. Cellulose microfibrils are synthesized by cellulose synthase complexes
  (CSCs) that are present at the plasma membrane. GALT2 localized to the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) and the Golgi and GALT5 localized to Golgi vesicles function in AGP
  O-glycosylation []. AtSOS5/AtFLA4, FEI1, and FEI2 are localized to the plasma membrane
  [,]. The GALT2 GALT5/AtSOS5/FEI1 FEI2 pathway is represented according to Basu et
  al. [].
