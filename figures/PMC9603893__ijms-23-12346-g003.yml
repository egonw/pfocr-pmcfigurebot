caption: Schematic representation of the role of integrin αvβ6 in cancer. Clathrin-dependent
  endocytosis of integrin αvβ6 activates ERK signalling cascade. Activated ERK results
  in phosphorylation of Ets-1 and NF-kB pathway. This results in transcription and
  translation of MMPs, Bcl-2, uPA, and IL-6. The activated Ets-1, upon localizing
  in the nucleus, results in integrin αvβ6 transcription and eventual recycling within
  the tumour environment. This results in a positive feedback look and promotes cancer
  tumour proliferation and disease progression (modified []). Reprinted/adapted with
  permission from Ref. []. 2022, Elsevier.
