caption: 'PI3K/AKT/mTOR and its associated metabolisms. Arrows indicate activation;
  T indicates inhibition; T with an arrow indicates PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibition leading
  to metabolic activation. Abbreviations: PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid cycle; FA, fatty acid; OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation. These effects were
  summarized from the reports mentioned in , , , , , . Different studies reported
  differential regulations to these metabolisms by modulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling.
  Various reports show different PI3K/AKT/mTOR responses for the same metabolism.'
