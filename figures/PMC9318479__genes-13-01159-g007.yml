caption: '(A): GO enrichment cluster map for differentially expressed genes; (B):
  KEGG enrichment cluster map for differentially expressed genes. Note: Red indicates
  metabolic pathways with high expression, and blue indicates metabolic pathways with
  relatively low expression. The parentheses after the label for each metabolic pathway
  include the number of genes in the metabolic pathway with significant differences.'
