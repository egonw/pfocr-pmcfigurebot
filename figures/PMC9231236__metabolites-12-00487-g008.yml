caption: 'Summary of Metabolic Pathway Analysis (MetPA) outputs. (A) Representation
  of the global metabolome overview containing all of the matched pathways arranged
  by p-Values on the y-axis and pathway impact (significance) values on the x-axis.
  The pathway impact values refer to the cumulative percentage from the matched metabolites
  and the maximum importance of each pathway is 1. (1) Phenylalanine metabolism; (2)
  Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis; (3) Arginine and proline metabolism; (4) Flavonoid
  biosynthesis; (5) Stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid, and gingerol biosynthesis; (6) alpha-Linolenic
  acid metabolism; (7) Citrate cycle (TCA cycle); and (8) Glyoxylate and dicarboxylate
  metabolism; (B) Heatmaps displaying differential qualitative alterations in the
  concentrations of selected metabolites; (C) Topological characteristics of the phenylalanine
  metabolism pathway, including quantification levels of phenylalanine and phenethylamine;
  (D) Topological characteristics of the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway including
  quantification levels of 4-coumaric acid, p-coumaroylquinic acid, caffeoylquinic
  acid, p-coumaraldehyde, caffeic acid, and ferulic acid. Abbreviation: C, Control
  (no stress; no seaweed extract biostimulant); DS, Drought stress (stress; no seaweed
  extract biostimulant); DS + SE, Drought stress with seaweed extract biostimulant;
  Phe, Phenylalanine; PEA, Phenethylamine; Trp, Tryptophan; CQA, Caffeoylquinic acid;
  CoQa, Coumaroylquinic acid; LA, Linolenic acid; 4-CA, 4-Coumaric acid; CA, Caffeic
  acid; FA, Ferulic acid; Hyp, 4-hydroxyproline; LT, Luteolin; and QUE, Quercetin.'
