caption: Proposed mechanisms by which upregulated endothelial Piezo1 results in pulmonary
  vascular remodeling and, potentially, occlusive intimal lesions. Upregulation of
  Piezo1 expression in pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAECs) enables membrane
  stretch to induce massive Ca2+ influx via Piezo1, a mechanosensitive cation channel.
  The resultant increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) activates
  AKT/mTOR signaling pathways (and potentially via calpains) to upregulate the Notch
  ligand, Jag-1 in PAECs. The upregulated Jagged-1 (Jag-1) binds to Notch1 receptors
  in adjacent PAECs, stimulates endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), and
  converts PAECs to highly proliferative myofibroblasts (myoFB) contributing to occlusive
  intimal lesions and arteriole muscularization. Upregulated Jag-1 in PAECs also binds
  to Notch3 receptors in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) to stimulate
  PASMC proliferation via canonical Notch signaling pathway contributing to pulmonary
  vascular remodeling. Under normal conditions, a rise in [Ca2+]cyt via Ca2+ influx
  through Piezo1 channels in PAECs can also activate endothelial nitric oxide (NO)
  synthase (eNOS) to produce NO and cause endothelium-dependent pulmonary vasodilation.
