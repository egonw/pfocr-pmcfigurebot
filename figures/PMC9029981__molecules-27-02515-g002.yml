caption: Effects of MLT treatment on cell viability, cell cycle, apoptosis, intracellular
  ROS, MDA level, and mitochondrial function. (A) Protective effect of gradient MLT
  on cell viability detected by CCK-8 method after treatment with concentrations of
  400 μmol/L H2O2, n = 6. (B) Protective effect of gradient MLT on cell viability
  detected by CCK-8 method after treatment with concentrations of 500 μmol/L H2O2,
  n = 6. (C) Protective effect of gradient MLT on cell viability detected by CCK-8
  method after treatment with concentrations of 600 μmol/L H2O2, n = 6. (D) Protective
  effect of gradient MLT on cell viability detected by CCK-8 method after treatment
  with concentrations of 800 μmol/L H2O2, n = 6. (E,F) Flow cytometry analysis of
  cell cycle in control group, H2O2 treatment group, and MLT + H2O2 group, n = 3.
  (G) Intracellular ROS level in gradient H2O2 group and 100 ng/mL MLT and gradient
  H2O2 group, n = 6. (H) MDA level under gradient H2O2 treatment and MLT + H2O2 treatment,
  n = 6. (I,J) Apoptosis-related gene expression and mtDNA levels in control group,
  H2O2 treatment group, and MLT + H2O2 group, n = 3. (K) Mitochondrial membrane potential
  in control group, H2O2 treatment group, and MLT + H2O2 group, n = 6. (L) Intracellular
  ATP level in control group, H2O2 treatment group, and MLT + H2O2 group, n = 6. (M,N)
  Flow cytometry analysis of cell apoptosis in control group, H2O2 treatment group,
  and MLT + H2O2 group, n = 3. H2O2 group, 2 h 400 μmol/L H2O2 treatment; MLT+ H2O2
  group, 12 h 100 ng/mL MLT treatment, followed by MLT wash with PBS and 2 h 400 μmol/L
  H2O2 treatment. The results were obtained from three independent replicates. The
  same letters on the error bar indicate no significant difference between the groups,
  and different letters above error bars (a–e) represent significant differences between
  groups at the level of p < 0.05.
