caption: Bifidobacterium mainly produces SCFA, Eq and EPS. These three substances
  inhibit the TNF-α/NF-κB signaling pathway, reduces the production of inflammatory
  mediators, and blocks the activation of inflammatory mediators, thereby preventing
  the formation of OC. SCFA can promote the production of Treg cells, indirectly inhibit
  the TNF-α/NF-κB signaling pathway, and also regulate OC formation through Treg cells.
  In addition, SCFA plays a role in the maintenance of the intestinal mucosal barrier,
  blocking the entry of inflammatory factors into the bloodstream, and reducing inflammation,
  leading to the inhibition of OC formation. More importantly, it has been shown that
  SCFA also increases the production of OPG. Eq also decreases the production of inflammatory
  factors, such as IL-6, inhibits RANK and RANKL, and can upregulate OPG expression.
  EPS mainly inhibits the production of inflammatory factors.
