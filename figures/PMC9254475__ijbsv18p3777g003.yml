caption: HTR1D inhibits apoptosis in vitro and promotes proliferation in vivo. a-b
  Western blot was performed to detect apoptosis-related proteins and phosphorylated
  AKT with or without MK-2206 (AKT inhibitor) in each cell line transfected with designated
  plasmids. c-d Flow cytometry analysis was applied to test cell apoptosis for PANC-1
  and CFPAC-1. e Schematic diagram of subcutaneous tumor formation. f-g Tumors derived
  from each cell line were displayed. h-i Quantification of tumor weight from f and
  g. j-k Representative images of immumohistochemical staining of tumors from f and
  g. l-m Quantification of the data shown in j and k. Each experiment was performed
  three times independently and results are presented as mean Â± s.d. Student's t-test
  was used to analyze the data. (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001)
article_title: HTR1D functions as a key target of HOXA10-AS/miR-340-3p axis to promote
  the malignant outcome of pancreatic cancer via PI3K-AKT signaling pathway.
