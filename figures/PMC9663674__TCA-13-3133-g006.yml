caption: Silenced circ‐EIF3I repressed LC tumor growth in vivo. (a) Circ‐EIF3I expression
  in H1299 cells transfected with si‐NC or sh‐circ‐EIF3I was detected by qRT‐PCR.
  Tumor volume (b) and tumor weight (c) were determined in the mice of the sh‐NC group
  and sh‐circ‐EIF3I group. (d) The expression of circ‐EIF3I and miR‐1253 was detected
  by qRT‐PCR in the tumor tissues of the sh‐NC group and sh‐circ‐EIF3I group. (e)
  WB analysis was used to measure NOVA2 protein expression in the tumor tissues of
  the sh‐NC group and sh‐circ‐EIF3I group. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.
