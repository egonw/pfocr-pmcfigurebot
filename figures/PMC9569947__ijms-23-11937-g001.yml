caption: Caspase 3 pathway. The apoptotic process can be triggered by external or
  internal signals that lead to a common outcome. The extrinsic pathway can be activated
  when death ligands bind to their corresponding death receptor. Upon ligand binding,
  an adapter protein is recruited. This leads to the activation of Caspase 8. The
  intrinsic pathway is initiated by pathological intracellular processes such as DNA
  damage, nutrient deprivation or oxidative stress. Increased levels of pro-apoptotic
  proteins such as Bax or Bak (from the family of Bcl-2 proteins) may also be associated
  with this activation. This triggers the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria,
  which then binds to and activates apoptosis protease activator protein 1 (Apaf-1),
  which in turn binds to and activates Caspase 9. Active Caspase 8 or Caspase 9 triggers
  the cleavage of Caspase 3 through its proenzyme. For apoptosis to take place, inhibitory
  apoptosis proteins (IAP) must be inactivated by Smac/Diablo proteins.
