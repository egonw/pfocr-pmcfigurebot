caption: 'ZSP activates PI3K/AKT signaling through inducing GFs and RTKs. a Relative
  mRNA expression levels of Insr, Irs1 and Irs2 (n = 4). b Heatmap of GF and RTK mRNA
  levels determined by transcriptomic analysis. Color of each box indicates log2 fold
  change for ZSP group vs. model group. c Relative mRNA expression levels of Csf1,
  Hgf, Vegfd, Pdgfc, Angpt2 and Flt3 (n = 4). All qPCR results were normalized to
  model group. Normal group: wt/wt mice treated with distilled water. Model group:
  db/db mice treated with distilled water. ZSP group: db/db mice treated with ZSP
  at 3.3 g/kg/day. All data presented as mean ± SD. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001,
  compared to the model group. #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001, compared to the
  normal group'
