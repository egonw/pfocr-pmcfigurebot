caption: Effect of hinokitiol on stemness-related protein expression. (A) MCF-7, (B)
  T47D, and (C) MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in a 6 cm dish and treated with hinokitiol
  for 48 h. Western blot was used to determine CD44, Nanog, SOX2, and Oct4 protein
  expression. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3–4). * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01;
  *** p < 0.001 as compared with control group.
article_title: Hinokitiol Inhibits Breast Cancer Cells In Vitro Stemness-Progression
  and Self-Renewal with Apoptosis and Autophagy Modulation via the CD44/Nanog/SOX2/Oct4
  Pathway.
