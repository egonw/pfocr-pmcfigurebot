caption: 'PPI network and biological function analysis of the predicted biomarkers.
  (A) PPI relationships and enriched pathways (table) for the 12 predicted biomarkers.
  A total of seven predicted biomarkers related to each other. In addition, nine predicted
  biomarkers were mapped on the response to stress pathway. The candidate biomarkers
  that had a strong relationship were mapped in the same pathway. (B) PPI network
  for predicted and confirmed biomarkers. The color of lines represented the confidence
  of connected evidence: the closer to red, the higher evidence. Generally, the predicted
  and confirmed biomarkers had strong relationships with each other; specifically,
  not as the other ten predicted, which are connected closely, CHGA and SDC2 were
  separated from them and were hubs in their belonged small networks. (C) KEGG pathway
  enrichment analysis results for predicted and confirmed biomarkers. Big circles
  represent enriched pathways, and small circles/diamonds represent confirmed/predicted
  biomarkers. Pathways and biomarkers were connected if the biomarkers were mapped
  on the pathways. There were some overlapping pathways among the confirmed and predicted
  biomarkers, and five of them were mapped on the Dopaminergic synapse pathway. (D)
  Dopaminergic synapse pathway. (E) Diagnostic ROC curve for multiple biomarkers combined
  by the 12 predicted biomarkers, which showed an AUC of 0.964.'
