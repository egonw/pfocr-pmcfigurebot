caption: 'Phenotypic effects of ROCK2 overexpression/downregulation and miR-139-5p/ROCK2
  pathway. (a) ROCK2 overexpression and 5-Aza treatment. Left: data in %, normalized
  to the average of JHH-6 overexpressing EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein,
  control cells) + 5-Aza treatment (0.8 μM), are expressed as mean ± SEM, n = 4; JHH-6
  overexpressing ROCK2 + 5-Aza vs. JHH-6 overexpressing EGFP + 5-Aza, * p = 0.035.
  Right: HuH-7 overexpressing ROCK2 + 5-Aza vs. HuH-7 overexpressing EGFP + 5-Aza
  (6 μM); data in %, normalized to the average of HuH-7 overexpressing EGFP + 5-Aza,
  are expressed as mean ± SEM, n = 3. (b) Molecular pathways regulated by miR-139-5p
  and effects on cell migration and proliferation: 5-Aza upregulates miR-139-5p, which
  in turn leads to the downregulation of ROCK2/cyclin D1/E2F1/cyclin B1/MMP-2 and
  the upregulation of p27kip1; this results in G1/G0-G2/M cell cycle arrest and in
  the impairment of cell migration.'
