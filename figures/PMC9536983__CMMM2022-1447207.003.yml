caption: 'The relationship between MSC-AS1 and miR-429. (a) The binding site between
  MSC-AS1 and miR-429 was predicted by starBase, and the mutant binding sequence was
  designed. (b) Double luciferase report assay was performed to validate the target
  interaction between MSC-AS1 and miR-429. Results determined that miR-429 was the
  direct target for MSC-AS1. ∗∗p < 0.01. (c) RNA pull down analysis was conducted
  to further validate the interaction between MSC-AS1 and miR-429. miR-429 could be
  pulled down by Bio-MSC-AS1-pellets complex. NS: no significant difference; ∗∗∗p
  < 0.001. (d) The interaction between MSC-AS1 and miR-429 was detected by qRT-PCR
  analysis after perturbed MSC-AS1 expression. Results showed that the expression
  of miR-429 was obviously reduced in MSC-AS1 overexpression cells, while significantly
  elevated after MSC-AS1 silence. NS: no significant difference; ∗∗∗p < 0.001.'
