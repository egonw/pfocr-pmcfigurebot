caption: (A-B), Parasites can generate ribose-5-phosphate using the oxidative pentose
  phosphate pathway (TgG6PDH-Tg6PGDH2-TgRPI pathway) and non-oxidative pentose phosphate
  pathway (TgTKT-TgTAL pathway). (C), Upon disruption of TgG6PDH, TgG6PDH-dependent
  pentose synthesis is blocked but ribose-5-phosphate is still produced by the intact
  downstream oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (Tg6PGDH2-TgRPI pathway) which might
  utilize host-derived PPP intermediates. (D), In Δ6pgdh2 mutants, glucose imported
  from host cells cannot be fully catabolized to create ribose-5-phosphate. Even so,
  ribose-5-phosphate was still partly produced through the TgTKT-TgTAL pathway. (E),
  Similar to Δ6pgdh2 mutants, the Δrpi mutants also partly produced ribose-5-phosphate
  through the TgTKT-TgTAL pathway. (F), Mutants lacking TgRuPE rely on the TgTKT-TgTAL
  pathway for supplying Xylulose 5P. Notably, the ribose-5-phosphate can be generally
  provided by the oxidative and non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. (G), In Δtal
  mutants, the ribose-5-phosphate can be provided through the oxidative pentose phosphate
  pathway and TgTKT-TgSBPase pathway.
