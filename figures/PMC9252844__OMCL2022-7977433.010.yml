caption: Schematic diagram of the therapeutic effect of vitexin on Staphylococcus
  aureus-induced mastitis. Vitexin inhibited the production of ROS by promoting PPARγ
  activity, increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes, and reduced inflammatory
  cytokines and apoptosis by alleviating ER stress and inactivation MAPKs and NF-κB
  signaling pathways.
