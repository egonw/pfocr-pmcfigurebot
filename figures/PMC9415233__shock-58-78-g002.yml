caption: 'Poly I:C activates MAVS in RAW 264.7 cells. A, Western immunoblot: poly
  I:C (5 μg/mL) was transfected or added to RAW cells for 18 hours. Cell lysate were
  subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted with the indicated antibodies. Note reduction
  of the MAVS monomer in the poly I:C–transfected but not the added cells, indicating
  activation of the MAVS pathway. Note also activation of nuclear factor κB (Ser536)
  and IRF3 (Ser396) with both transfection and addition. B, Immunofluorescence: RAW
  cells were transfected with Mito-RFP plasmid for 24 hours. On the next day, cells
  were transfected with poly I:C (5 μg/mL) for 24 hours (control cells were mock-transfected)
  and stained for MAVS. Note disruption of threadlike mitochondria to short mitochondria
  after transfection with poly I:C. Note also more mitochondria devoid of MAVS. Bar
  indicates 5 μm.'
