caption: 'Activation of the Nrf2 signalling pathway with tBHQ inhibited renal NADPH
  oxidase activity and attenuated ROS generation in STZ-induced diabetic rats. (A)
  Western blot analysis of Nrf2, HO-1, NOX2, NOX4, Bax, Bcl-2 and cleaved-caspase3
  expression in kidney tissues from different groups. (B) Quantification analysis
  of protein expression from Panel A. (C) Representative immunohistochemical staining
  for Nrf2, NOX2 and NOX4 in kidney tissues from different groups. (D) Quantification
  analysis of Nrf2, NOX2 and NOX4 expression in Panel C. (E) Representative images
  of DHE staining from different groups. (F) Quantitative analysis of the relative
  fluorescence intensity of DHE. (∗P < 0.05 vs. Control group, #P < 0.05 vs. DN group.)
  The uncropped images of (A) were referred to in supplementary Figure 5.'
