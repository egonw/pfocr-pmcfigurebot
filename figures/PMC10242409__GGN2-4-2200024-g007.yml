caption: Coverage of the human muscle transcriptome. We consider the core (or constitutive)
  transcriptome for skeletal muscle from 810 sedentary humans. Five (n = 53‐278) short‐read
  RNA‐seq data sets profiling skeletal muscle (total = 619. RNA‐seq.A = FUSION cohort
  (≈60 million reads, n = 278,[] RNA‐seq.B = GESTALT cohort (≈60 million reads, n
  = 53,[]), RNA‐seq.C = Robinson cohort (≈44 million reads, n = 74,[]), RNA‐seq.D
  = Kulkarni cohort (≈34 million reads, n = 136,[]) and RNA‐seq.E = Rubenstein cohort
  (≈29 million reads, n = 78,[])). A threshold for a gene being detected in a cDNA
  library typically relies on a threshold of a minimum of 5, 8, or 16 raw counts per
  gene[] and we have utilized >5 in the present analysis. To count as being constitutively
  expressed (e.g., tissue type defining) each gene should reach this threshold in
  every sample within a study. Modeling of disease genes can reduce this threshold
  to being detected in all case samples (for example). Defining the constitutive transcriptome
  is very critical for the interpretation of pathway analysis and so we focus on genes
  that were above background noise in each sample, within a given laboratory experiment
  to subsequently illustrate the impact on pathway statistics. The RNA‐seq data are
  contrasted with data produced using a modern high‐density array (HTA 2.0, n = 191[]).
  A) Examination of the genes consistently detected per study using RNA‐seq and their
  overlap across studies, including major biotypes. Each cohort (A–E) has a further
  10–15% of protein‐coding genes are expressed in every sample but unique to that
  RNA‐seq analysis B) As the RNA‐seq data set produced less reliable data, the core
  genes expressed using RNA‐seq (>95% of which are protein‐coding) are re‐plotted
  omitting RNA‐seq.B cohort. C) Comparison of the four RNA‐seq cohorts A,C–E) with
  the muscle HTA 2.0 array data. The array data is processed to remove all low‐performing
  probes (≈2 million), and then after summarizing at the probe‐set level (ENST), only
  probe‐sets with signals above 2 log2 units are retained, equating to >1SD absolute
  signal value.[ ,  ] This plot shows that the array captures a far more comprehensive
  view of the noncoding transcriptome. D) Application of a more conservative signal
  filter to the HTA data reduces the number of reported genes (some of which are genuine
  signals). The list of long noncoding RNAs (n = 8847) is contrasted with the other
  RNA‐seq data sets from (B) using a Venn diagram tool.[] Around 20% of those lost
  with this more severe arbitrary filter were in fact expressed in all samples form
  one of the RNA‐seq datasets. Further details of the code and input data can be found
