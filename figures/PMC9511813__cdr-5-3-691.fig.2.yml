caption: 'SIAH marks proliferating tumor cells at a single-cell resolution, and SIAH
  is a therapy-responsive and prognostic biomarker that can be used to risk-stratify
  incomplete responders in NACT/NST-treated high-risk and locally advanced breast
  cancer. IMPAX stands for the IMPAX digital mammography, a powerful diagnostic platform
  for breast imaging at the Sentara Breast Centers. (A) pCR is a good prognostic marker
  associated with long-term survival post-NACT/NST. However, for the pIR patients
  with residual disease, additional tools are needed to distinguish which patients
  are at high risk for early tumor relapse and thus who may need additional adjuvant
  chemotherapies. (B) The pIR patients with no or low SIAH expression in residual
  tumors post-NACT/NST stayed in remission and have prolonged survival (examples:
  patients #82 and #28). (C) In contrast, the pIR patients with persistent high SIAH
  expression in residual disease post-NACT/NST developed early relapse and succumbed
  to their chemoresistant and metastatic diseases (examples: patients #109 and #129).
  Conclusion: We propose that persistent high SIAH expression in residual tumors is
  associated with early tumor relapse and poor prognosis, while no or low SIAH expression
  in residual tumors is associated with tumor remission and good prognosis post-NACT/NST.

  response; NACT: neoadjuvant chemotherapy; NST: neoadjuvant systemic therapy; PCR:
