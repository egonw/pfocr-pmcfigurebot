caption: CXCL8 treatment activates the NF-κB signaling pathways via CXCR2 in endothelial
  cells. (a). Representative images of CXCR1 and CXCR2 IHC staining in human ovarian
  cystadenocarcinoma tissues. Images were retrieved from v22.proteinatlas.org, https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000163464-CXCR1/pathology/ovarian+cancer#ihc,
  and https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000180871-CXCR2/pathology/ovarian+cancer#img.
  (b). IF staining was performed to check CD31 (red) and CXCR2 (green) expression
  in PUMC-HUVEC-T1 cells. (c). qRT-PCR and western blotting were performed to check
  CXCR2 expression in PUMC-HUVEC-T1 cells 48 h after lentivirus-mediated CXCR2 knockdown.
  (d,f,g). Western blotting was performed to check the expression of IκBa, p-IκBa,
  NF-κB p65, and p-p65 expression in PUMC-HUVEC-T1 cells with CXCL8 treatment alone
  or in combination with SB225002 (30 nM, added 2 h before CXCL8 treatment) and in
  the cells with CXCR2 knockdown and CXCL8 treatment (50 ng/mL for 12 h). Quantitation
  (n = 3, f,g) of protein expression was conducted based on integrated density measured
  by ImageJ. (e). Immunofluorescent staining was performed to visualize NF-κB p65
  expression in PUMC-HUVEC-T1 cells as treated in panel (d). ***, p < 0.001.
