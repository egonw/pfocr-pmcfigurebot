caption: KDR is a key factor for the upregulation of VEGF signaling pathway in CH
  group. (A) The violin plot shows the differential expression of the gene KDR (VEGFR2
  gene) in the VEGF signaling pathway between the CH group and the normal control
  group. (B) A simplified scheme showing protein interaction in the functional interaction
  network of VEGF signaling pathway. The interactions were generated using STRING
