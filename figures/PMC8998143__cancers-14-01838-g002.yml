caption: 'Illustration of the key components in the signaling pathway of melanin synthesis.
  Keratinocytes trigger epidermal melanogenesis in response to UVR as follows: α-MSH
  is secreted by keratinocytes and stimulates MC1R, MC1R activates melanogenesis and
  TYR transcription, TYR promotes eumelanin synthesis, and ASIP blocks MC1R, leading
  to pheomelanin synthesis. This image was created using BioRender (BioRender.com).'
