caption: Nanoplastic exposure impairs the behavioral ability of zebrafish larvae.
  (A) Average distance traveled by larvae treated with nanoplastics in 1 min under
  5 min light and dark (black bars on the x-axis) conditions for 30 min. (n = 24 for
  each group) (B) Total distances of zebrafish swimming. (C) Trajectory graph of zebrafish
  larvae with or without nanoplastic treatment at different concentrations after 96
  h exposure. Data are shown as the mean Â± SD. *P < 0.05 and ****P < 0.0001 compared
  with the control.
