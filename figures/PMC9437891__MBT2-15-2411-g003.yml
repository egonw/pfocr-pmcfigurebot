caption: Oxidative stress activates the proHJ transcription in B. subtilis 168. Exponentially
  growing cultures in SMM were exposed to sub‐lethal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide
  and incubated for 12 h at 37°C. (A) shows the differences in optical densities,
  whereas (B) represents the relative fluorescent GFP signal measured from the corresponding
  cultures. The orange curve represents the outgrowth and relative fluorescent signal
  of control samples without a stressor. The black curve represents the outgrowth
  and relative fluorescent signal of control samples with MIC of kanamycin. All measurements
  were performed in biological duplicates, and the mean values were plotted on the
  graphs. The relative fluorescent signal was estimated by dividing the GFP signal
  by the cell density. The value is represented in arbitrary units.
