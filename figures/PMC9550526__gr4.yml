caption: 'Representative western blots for HIF-1α (A), PI3K (B), AKT (C), and p-AKT
  (D) and quantitative analysis of HIF-1α (E), PI3K (F), AKT (G), p-AKT (H) protein
  levels of bovine muscle when stored at 4 °C for 0.5, 2, 6, 12, 24, and 36 h after
  treatment with 200 μM H2O2 (H2O2 group) and saline (control group). About 50 μg
  of protein was loaded per lane. Actin levels indicated equal protein loading per
  line. Protein expression levels are expressed as the proportion of abundance of
  the samples and actin. Data were expressed as mean ± standard error (n = 6). The
  capital letters and lowercase letters represent the significant difference (P < 0.01)
  in the same group at different times, respectively. * (P < 0.05) represents the
  difference between the two groups at the same time point. HIF-1α: hypoxia-inducible
  factor-1α, PI3K: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, AKT: serine-threonine kinase, and
  p-AKT: phosphorylated AKT.'
