caption: Interaction diagram between IBV QX NSP16 and signal pathway in BMDCs. The
  mechanism of NSP16 affects mouse/Avian BMDCs. Cells can secrete interferon in response
  to Poly(I:C) invasion through the RIG-I pathway. Chicken cells lack the RIG-I receptor,
  so they cannot respond to Poly(I:C) invasion through this pathway. At the same time,
  NSP16 activates the cGAS/STING signal Pathway, and the NSP16 protein is recognized
  and presented by MHCII. The schematic in a was created with Figdraw.com.
