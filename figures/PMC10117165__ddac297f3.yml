caption: Parkin regulates SREBP2-LPL pathway by downregulating FBXW7β. (A) Expression
  levels of proteins known to be involved in SREBP2 signaling in SH-SY5Y cell line
  stably overexpressing FLAG-Parkin compared to cells with vector controls. The higher
  and lower MW bands in S1P blot correspond to precursor and active S1P protein, respectively.
  (n.s. = not statistically significant; **  P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001
  (t-test), n = 4 biological replicates for all proteins, except FBXW7β and INSIG-2
  (n = 3 biological replicates)). Representative images in (i) and (ii) are from independent
  experiments. Experiment (ii) are identical with the controls in  (lane 1–2). (B)
  Protein expression levels of LPL (detected with LPL 5D2 antibody) and SREBP2 in
  stable Parkin O/E or control SH-SY5Y cells transiently transfected with either human
  EGFP-FBXW7α or EGFP-FBXW7β. Overexpressed FLAG-Parkin and FBXW7 protein isoforms
  were detected using anti-FLAG or anti-GFP antibody, respectively. (n.s. = not statistically
  significant; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01 (ANOVA), n = 3 biological replicates for all
  proteins). Last panel shows a hypothetical pathway for Parkin-FBXW7β-SREBP2-LPL
  signaling. Actin serves as total protein loading controls for (A-B).
