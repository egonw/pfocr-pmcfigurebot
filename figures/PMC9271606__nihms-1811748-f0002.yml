figure_title: Summary of the potential mechanisms contributing to bone fragility in
  diabetes
caption: Both type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) cause chronic hyperglycemia
  resulting in accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and senescent
  cells that subsequently affect osteocyte viability and functions via increased RAGE
  signaling or the production of a pro-inflammatory senescence-associated secretory
  phenotype (SASP). These changes may increase the secretion of osteocyte-derived
  sclerostin and decrease the ability of osteocytes to sense mechanical stimuli thereby
  decreasing bone quality and increasing fracture risk. Therapeutics targeting the
  RAGE signaling pathway (i.e., RAGE inhibitors), senescent cells and the SASP (i.e.,
  senotherapeutics), and those that inhibit sclerostin or increase mechanical stimulation
  of osteocytes (e.g., high-impact exercise) may improve osteocyte viability and functions,
  as well as alleviate the deleterious effects of diabetes on the skeleton.
