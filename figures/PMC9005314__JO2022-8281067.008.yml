caption: Associations between risk score of signature with immune microenvironment
  and cancer hallmark. (a) The subgroup analysis of 22 immune infiltrating cells between
  the high- and low-risk groups. (b) Heat map of microenvironment score, immune score,
  and stromal scores between the high- and low-risk groups. Red color indicates higher
  score, and blue color refers to lower score. (c) Box plots of microenvironment scores,
  immune score, and stromal scores between the high- and low-risk groups. (d) Heat
  map of scores for immunity- and tumor-related pathway between the high- and low-risk
  groups. Red color indicates higher score, and blue color refers to lower score.
  (e) Box plots of scores for immunity- and tumor-related pathway between the high-
  and low-risk groups. ∗ means p < 0.05; ∗∗ means p < 0.01; ∗∗∗ means p < 0.001; and
  ∗∗∗∗ means p < 0.0001. (f) GSEA analysis of high- vs. low-risk score groups.
