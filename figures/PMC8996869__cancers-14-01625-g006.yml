caption: Nanostring analysis, indicating modulations in EMT and metastasis regulating
  mRNAs in Akt1-deficient PC3 and DU145 cells. (A,B) Volcano plot showing highly modulated,
  EMT regulating mRNAs in Akt1-deficient PC3 and DU145 cells compared to Akt1 intact
  controls. (C) Bar graph showing mRNAs identified to be modulated by Akt1 deficiency
  in PC3 and DU145 cells compared to the predicted and known targets from dbEMT analysis.
  Only changes in the mRNA that are statistically significant (p < 0.05) are shown
  (n = 3).
