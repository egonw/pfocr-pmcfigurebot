caption: Metabolic pathways associated with exposure to high levels of PFOS (on left)
  or HCC (on right) in 50 cases and 50 controls from the MEC cohort.Metabolic pathways
  are grouped into super pathways as indicated on the right of the plot. Metabolic
  pathway enrichment was performed using MetaboAnalyst version 5.0. Point size is
  proportional to the number of significant metabolites associated with each pathway.
  HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; MEC, multiethnic cohort; PFOS, perfluorooctane sulfonic
  acid.
