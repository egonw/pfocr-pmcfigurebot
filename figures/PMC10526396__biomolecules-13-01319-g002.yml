caption: The integrative physiology of muscle, bone, and adipose. Myostatin is a negative
  regulator of skeletal muscle and bone mass. Myostatin exerts its effects on bone
  mass by inhibiting bone formation through stimulating the bone resorption pathway
  and on muscle through the inhibition of myogenesis by downregulating the master
  transcription factor MyoD. However, exercise leads not only to reduction of myostatin
  and SOST expression, but also simultaneously increases the expression of irisin,
  which stimulates the bone formation pathway. While adiponectin increases bone mass,
  leptin reduces bone mass. The dual effect of leptin signaling on bone differs considerably
  between axial and appendicular regions. Image is modified from Saad 2020 [] with
