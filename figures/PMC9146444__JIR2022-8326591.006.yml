caption: M2-MDEs promote tumorigenesis of meningioma cells in vitro and in vivo. (a)
  3D tumorspheres formed in vitro by meningioma cells cocultured with MDEs. Scale
  bar 200 μm. (b) Measurement and statistical analysis of the volume of 3D tumorspheres.
  (c) Labeling of proliferating meningioma cells in 3D tumorspheres with EdU staining
  and detection of EdU+ cell ratio by flow cytometry. (d, e) Dissection of subcutaneous
  xenografts and measurement of tumor volume. (f) Proliferating cells were identified
  by immunofluorescence using antibody against Ki-67. Tumor proliferative activity
  was evaluated by calculating the proportion of Ki-67+ cells. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗p < 0.001.
