caption: 'Colorectal cancer: In the bacterial treatment of colorectal cancer, the
  whole bacterial cell and its metabolites can be used, including probiotics associated
  with the bacteria, peptides such as bacteriocins, or bacterial toxins. The anti-cancer
  mechanism of this type of treatment includes: 1) Creating pores in the cell membrane,
  2) induction of apoptosis, 3) TNF-Î± production, 4) inhibition of metastasis. Sometimes
  molecular sites lead to apoptosis of cancer cells through intrinsic or extrinsic
  pathways. C. perfringens enterotoxin (bacterial toxin) CPE can directly interact
  with claudin-3 and claudin-4, which are overexpressed in colorectal cancer cell
  membranes. Another mechanism of the anticancer effect of bacterial toxins is cytotoxicity
  through the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Bacteriocins create membranous adhesions
  when attached to the membrane and a specific type of cell surface that induces cell
  lysis and cell death'
