caption: UBQLN4 promotes STING proteasomal degradation during cisplatin treatment.
  (A) STING mRNA levels in normal breast (Normal), primary BC (BC) and metastatic
  BC (MBC) tissues in the TCGA and GTEx databases (one‐way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple
  comparisons test). (B) STING mRNA levels in tissues from the tumour‐adjacent normal
  breast (Normal), luminal (Lum), luminal‐HER2 (Lum‐HER2), HER2 and TNBC subtypes
  in the TCGA BRCA database (one‐way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparisons test).
  (C) Relapse‐Free Survival (RFS) analysis for TNBC patients with low (n = 110) versus
  high (n = 110) STING mRNA expression in TCGA, GEO and EGA databases combined. (D)
  Western blotting analysis for STING pathway molecules (pTBK1, TKB1, BAT3, UBQLN4,
  cGAS and STING) and β‐actin (loading control) in TNBC cell lines untreated or treated
  with cisplatin (5 μM, 8 hours). pTBK1/TBK1 ratio was quantified relative to respective
  controls. (E) Correlation between STING protein levels and cisplatin activity for
  45 cancer cell lines in the NCI‐60 and GDSC‐MGH‐Sanger datasets. Protein levels
  were determined using SWATH‐mass spectrophotometry. (F and G) Drug sensitivity assays
  comparing si‐Ctrl and si‐STING in MDA‐MB‐231 (F) and HCC1937 (G) cell lines treated
  with different cisplatin concentrations (two‐way ANOVA and Sidak's multiple comparisons
  test). (H) Correlation between UBQLN4 and STING protein levels for 59 cancer cell
  lines in the NCI‐60 dataset. (I and J) Quantification of STING protein levels for
  CHX assay in MDA‐MB‐231 UBQLN4‐KO (I), si‐BAT3 (J), and the respective control cell
  lines treated with cisplatin (5 μM) ± MG‐132 (5 μM) for 8 hours (two‐way ANOVA and
  Sidak's multiple comparisons test). (K) Co‐immunoprecipition (Co‐IP) assay in MDA‐MB‐231
  UBQLN4‐OV, UBQLN4‐KO and UBQLN4‐OV+si‐BAT3 cell lines treated with cisplatin (5 μM)
  ± MG‐132 (5 μM) for 8 hours. Co‐IPs were performed using STING or control Ab. Protein
  levels were assessed in whole‐cell lysates (WC) and co‐IP fractions (IP). Drug sensitivity
  and CHX assays in each cell line were performed in replicates (n = 3)
