caption: 'The ERK1/2-HIF-1β-NF-E2 signaling pathway is involved in DMAG-induced megakaryocyte
  differentiation. (A) Western blot analysis of ERK1/2 phosphorylation after HEL cells
  were pretreated with the ERK1/2 inhibitor SCH772984 (10 mM) followed by DMAG (40
  mM) stimulation for 3 days. The histograms show the ratio of p-ERK/ERK, HIF-1b/b-actin
  and NF-E2/b-actin for each group. (B) Giemsa-Wright staining shows the effects of
  SCH772984 on DMAG (40 mM)-induced changes in cell morphology. Bars represent 25
  mm. (C) Phalloidin staining shows the effects of SCH772984 on DMAG (40 mM)-induced
  multinuclear formation. Bars represent 25 mm. (D) Detection of the expression of
  CD41 and CD42b by flow cytometry indicates the effects of SCH772984 on DMAG (40
  mM)-induced megakaryocyte differentiation. The histogram shows the percentage of
  CD41+CD42b+ cells for each group. In (A) and (D), data are shown as the mean ± standard
  deviation from three independent experiments. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, versus
  the corresponding control. DMAG: 3,8-di-O-methylellagic acid 2-O-glucoside.'
