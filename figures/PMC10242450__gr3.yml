caption: Relationship between the mTOR activity signature in the vaginal microenvironment(A)
  Heatmap of the leading mTOR edge proteins identified by GSEA and relationship to
  vaginal microbiome.(B) Core mTOR proteins identified using the Pathway Interaction
  Database were used to identify mTOR expression. An mTOR activity score was determined
  using partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) inference of the latent
  variable combining pathway proteins or transcripts to describe mTOR pathway activity
  relative to LD status (“mTOR Score”). This numeric score was then used to determine
  both host and bacterial factors that associate with a high mTOR score. See A for
  mTOR score analysis performed using Nugent score.(C) Vaginal tissue gene expression
  for immune response pathways (inflammation, TNFα, IFNγ) overlapped with genes associated
  with mTOR and LPS-stimulated genes identified using significant pathways identified
  GSEA when comparing Lactobacillus-dominant (LD) with non-dominant (nLD) groups.(D)
  mTOR score is significantly correlated with measured epithelial barrier protein
  expression in the mucosal fluid (Spearman’s correlations, p < 0.0001) showing key
  distinctions in barrier function and structural changes that were clearly separated
  by cluster analysis.
