figure_title: RORA accelerated PE progression by activating the JAK2/STAT3 signaling
  pathway. (A) Dot plot of dysregulated pathways in PE tissue. The JAK2/STAT signaling
  pathway was activated. (B) GSEA pathways enriched by DEGs. (C) Protein levels of
  p-JAK2, JAK2, p-STAT3, and STAT3 were determined by western blot. (D) After RO8191
  was added, the protein levels of p-JAK2, JAK2, p-STAT3, and STAT3 in indicated groups
  were detected. (E) Cells invasion and migration in indicated groups were measured
  by Transwell assay. (F) Protein levels of cyclin A, PCAN, CDK1, VEGFA, and VEGFR2
  were determined by western bot. *p<0.01 compared to normoxia group; †p<0.01 compared
  to si-NC group; ‡p<0.01 compared to si-RORA-1 group. RORA, RAR related orphan receptor
  A; PE, preeclampsia; DEG, differentially expressed gene
