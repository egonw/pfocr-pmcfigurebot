caption: 'SMY regulates the key signalling pathway in rats with ISO-induced myocardial
  hypertrophy. (a) ADCY1, PKA, PPARγ, and Glut4 levels. (b) Relative expression of
  ADCY1, PKA, PPARγ, and Glut4. (c) HIF1ɑ, PPARɑ, CPT1A, and Glut1 levels. (d) Relative
  expression of HIF1α, PPARα, CPT1A, and Glut1. n = 3 rats per group. The data are
  presented as the mean ± SEM; p < 0.05 is considered significant (#p < 0.05, ##p
  < 0.01 and ###p < 0.001 compared with the blank group; ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01 and
  ∗∗∗p < 0.001 compared with the model group).'
