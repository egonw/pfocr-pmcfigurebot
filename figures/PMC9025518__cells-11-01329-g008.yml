caption: 'Chronic increased cytosolic calcium level results in activation of PKC and
  NF-κB pathway in Calr+/− kidney. (A): Activity assay demonstrated significant activation
  of PKC in Calr+/− mouse kidney because of alteration in cytosolic calcium concentration.
  (B): Western blot analysis of protein extracts from Calr+/+ and Calr+/− kidneys
  showed an activation of NF-κB pathway as evidenced by up-regulation of p65 in heterozygous
  kidney and down-regulation of the pathway inhibitor IkB. (C,D): The nuclear translocation
  of p65 confirmed the activation of NF-κB pathway, the nuclear protein Lamin A/C
  was used as control. (E): Western blot analysis of iNos was performed for kidney
  lysates of Calr+/− and Calr+/+ mice. Actb was used as loading control. Bar diagram
  representing the quantification of the MM and DM of iNos. Western blot results are
  shown in (B) (n = 4 *, p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01, ***: p < 0.001). MM: monomer, DM:
  dimer. (F): Immunohistochemical staining of iNos shows no significant change in
  expression pattern of protein in Calr+/− compared to Calr+/+. (G): Proteomic data
  showed an up-regulation of IL6st the interleukin-6 receptor, revealing an increased
  inflammation upon NF-κB pathway activation in Calr+/− mouse kidney.'
