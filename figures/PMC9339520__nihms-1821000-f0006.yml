caption: Pathway analyses of differential expressed genes in iHEECs following EGR1
  knockdown. (A) GSEA of differential expressed genes between the NT siRNA and EGR1
  siRNA groups showing normalized enrichment scores for listed Hallmark pathways.
  On the x-axis, normalized enrichment scores for gene expression changes (up or down
  represented by red and blue bars respectively) following a reduction in EGR1 levels
  in iHEECs; the y-axis displays hallmark gene-sets representing well-defined biological
  states or processes (). (B) DAVID gene functional clustering analysis of genes differentially
  expressed between the NT siRNA and EGR1 siRNA treated iHEEC groups.
