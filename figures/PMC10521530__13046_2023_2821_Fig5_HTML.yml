caption: TMTC3 induced the production of GTP and activity of Rho GTPase through STAT3
  pathway. A and B. The GTP and GDP levels in TMTC3 knockdown cells or IMPDH2 overexpression
  cells were detected by mass spectrometry in KYSE180 (A) and KYSE450 (B) cells, respectively.
  C. Blot analyses for GTP-bound RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 levels in TMTC3 knockdown cells,
  with or without overexpression of IMPDH2, following Rho GTPase pull-down experiments.
  Total protein levels were detected from whole cell lysate. D. Schematic representation
  of the GTPase cycle between their GDP-bound and GTP-bound conformations (left).
  The enrichment terms of differential expressed genes in IMPDH2 knockdown cells (right).
  E. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of RNA-seq data on IMPDH2 knockdown cells.
  NES, normalized enrichment score. F. Cross correlation analysis of IMPDH2 expression
  and genes in HIF-1α pathway from TCGA database. G. Blot analyses for the downstream
  proteins of TMTC3 in TMTC3 knockdown cells, with or without overexpression of IMPDH2.
  All data are expressed as the mean ± SD. **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001. n = 3
