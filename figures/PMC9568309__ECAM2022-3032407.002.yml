caption: ZJW mediates the miR-200s/JNK signaling pathway to regulate drug resistance
  in colorectal cancer. (a) Real-time PCR assay of miR-200s levels in HCT116 and HCT116/L-OHP
  cells treated with L-OHP combined with different concentrations of ZJW. (b and c)
  Western blot assay of JNK and p-JNK protein in HCT116 cells and HCT116/L-OHP cells
  treated with L-OHP combined with different concentrations of ZJW. ∗, P < 0.05; ∗∗,
  P < 0.01; ∗∗∗, P < 0.001 compared to HCT116/L.
