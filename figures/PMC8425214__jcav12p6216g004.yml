caption: 'The inhibitory target involved in the Hippo signaling pathway. The switch
  that closes the Hippo pathway is whether YAP enters the nucleus. When YAP is phosphorylated,
  it will be stagnated in the nucleus and the Hippo pathway will be activated; when
  YAP enters the nucleus, the Hippo pathway will be closed, which could promote the
  occurrence of tumors. The current targeted inhibitors have two ideas, one is to
  promote the phosphorylation of YAP. For example: XMU-MP-1 could inhibit the phosphorylation
  of MST1/2, promote the cascade of MST1/2, LAST1/2, and YAP, and promote the phosphorylation
  of YAP; Ki-16425 could inhibit the phosphorylation of LAST1/2 and promote the phosphorylation
  of YAP; CAS could directly promote phosphorylation of YAP. Another idea is to inhibit
  the interaction of YAP with TEAD after entering the nucleus. Here, Verteporfin compounds
  could be used to achieve this function.'
