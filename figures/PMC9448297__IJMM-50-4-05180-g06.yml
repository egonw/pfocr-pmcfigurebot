caption: Metabolic heterogeneity protects metastatic mucosal melanomas from ferroptosis.
  COMM-AD cells asymmetrically divided into COMM-SUS cells and excreted lactate. COMM-SUS
  cells inhibited ferroptosis and reprogrammed metabolism by taking up more lactate
  to accumulate NADH and activate the PPP to increase NADPH levels. Increased NADH
  and NADPH accumulation improve the ability of COMM-SUS cells evade ferroptosis.
  COMM, Chinese oral mucosal melanoma; COMM-AD, cells with adhesive morphology; COMM-SUS,
  cells grown in suspension; MCT, monocarboxylate transporter; PPP, pentose phosphate
  pathway.
