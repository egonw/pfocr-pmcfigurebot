caption: 'Effects of ALA on FFAR4/βarr2 signaling pathway in vitro. The mRNA expression
  of (a) FFAR4, (b) βarr2, (c) TAK1, (d) NF-κB, (e) TNF-α, (f) IL-6, (g) NFATc1 and
  (h) TRAP in RANKL-induced RAW264.7 cells with or without ALA treatment were measured
  by RT-qPCR. * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001 vs. Control (0.1% BSA + 0.05% ethanol (−),
  RANKL (−), ALA (−)). Δp < 0.05, ΔΔp < 0.01, ΔΔΔp < 0.001 vs. Model (0.1% BSA + 0.05%
  ethanol (−), RANKL (+), ALA (−)). #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001 represents
  the comparison between the two groups. + and − indicate with and without treatment,
  respectively.'
