caption: Expression profiles of seven JH signalling-related genes at different developmental
  stages of T. absoluta. The horizontal axis represents different developmental stages,
  A to K representing the first instar larval stage (2 d), the second instar larval
  stage (4 d), the third instar larval stage (6 d), the fourth instar larval stage
  (8 d), early pupation (14 d), late pupation (18 d), early female (21 d), early male
  (21 d), late female (30 d), late male (30 d), respectively. The vertical axis shows
  the relative expression level is expressed by mean ± s.e.m. The different letters
  (a, b) represent groups with significant differences according ANOVA test (Tukey's
  test, p < 0.05).
