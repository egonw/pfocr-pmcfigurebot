caption: Effects of sialidase Neu3 overexpression on the RISK pathway activation and
  HIF-α expression. Activation of the RISK pathway and expression of HIF-1α in scramble
  and OX-Neu3 cells exposed to IRI were evaluated by Western Blot. (A) Western Blot
  of HIF-1α; phospho-Akt (Thr308) and total Akt; phospho-Erk1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) and
  total Erk1/2; Calnexin; (B) ratio between phospho-Akt (Thr308) and total Akt; (C)
  ratio between phosho-Erk1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) and total Erk1/2; (D) HIF-1α expression
  level. Calnexin was used as a housekeeper to normalize protein expression levels.
  “S” is the abbreviation for SCR cells; “N” is the abbreviation for OX-Neu3 cells.
  Data are expressed as relative amounts compared with scramble cells, used as internal
  control for each time point analyzed (SCR dashed line). Each square in the graphs
  represent an experimental replicate. Statistical significance was determined by
  the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test by comparing OX-Neu3 cells to SCR cells at
  any time point analyzed. * p < 0.05.
