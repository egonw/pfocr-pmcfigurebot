caption: 'DENV and host post-translational regulation: A DENV NS3 interacts with TRIM69,
  induced as an Interferon Stimulated Gene (ISG), activating the ubiquitination pathway
  to restrict DENV replication []. B Conversely, ubiquitination of NS3 prevents the
  formation of the protease complex (NS2B3), inhibiting the cleavage of Interferon
  response-related genes, namely cGAS and STING. This results in an elevated host
  interferon response, targeting DENV replication [, ]. C Glycosylation of DENV proteins
  aids attachment to host surface receptors and various complementary proteins, contributing
  to immune evasion and viral propagation [â€“]. D DENV NS5 interacts with STAT2, preventing
  its phosphorylation and targeting it for proteasomal degradation [, ]'
