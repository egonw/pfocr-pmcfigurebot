caption: Decreased expression of SMYD2 leads to weakened proliferation, migration
  and invasion of A549 and NCI-H1299 cells. (a) A549 and NCI-H1299 cells were transfected
  with sh-SMYD2 and sh-NC, respectively, and SMYD2 levels were detected by RT-qPCR.
  (b) CCK-8 experiment showed that knocking down SMYD2 inhibited the proliferation
  of A549 and NCI-H1299 cells. (c) Transwell cell invasion experiment showed that
  after silencing SMYD2, the invasion ability of A549 and NCI-H1299 cells decreased
  (×200 times). (d) The clone formation experiment showed that after silencing SMYD2,
  the cloning ability of A549 and NCI-H1299 cells decreased (×200 times). ∗∗P < 0.01.
