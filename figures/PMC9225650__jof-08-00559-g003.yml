caption: Fun30 regulates the expression of RTT109, SNF2, TEL1, and MEC1 in C. albicans.
  (A). Expression of FUN30, RTT109, SNF2, TEL1, and MEC1 in FUN30Hz and ∆FUN30 was
  compared to the expression in the wild-type strain using qPCR. (B). Plate assays
  were performed in response to genotoxic agents. (C). Expression of RDN18, UBC13,
  and EFB1 in FUN30Hz and ∆FUN30 was compared to the expression in the wild-type strain
  using qPCR. (D). Expression of FUN30, RTT109, TEL1, and MEC1 in wild type BWP17-URA3,
  FUN30Hz-URA3, FUN30Hz/FUN30OE-URA3, and FUN30Hz/FUN30OEK593A-URA3 strains using
  qPCR. The FUN30OEK593A construct overexpresses an ATPase-dead mutant of Fun30 protein.
  (E). The occupancy of Fun30myc on FUN30, RTT109, SNF2, TEL1, and MEC1 promoters
  was compared in FUN30myc and FUN30mycHz strains by ChIP. (F). The occupancy of H3K56ac
  on FUN30, RTT109, SNF2, TEL1, and MEC1 promoters was compared in FUN30myc and FUN30mycHz
  strains by ChIP. Unless stated otherwise, the qPCR and ChIP data are presented as
  average ± s.e.m. of three biological replicates. A star indicates p < 0.05.
