caption: (A,B) Volcano plots comparing gene expression in single cells and Ingenuity
  Pathway analysis (−log10 p-value > 3) of CAD high vs. CAD low (A) and of DM+ vs.
  DM− (B) in all CD4+ T cells. Red bar means positive Z-score, and blue bar means
  negative Z-score. (C) Dot plots of differentially expressed genes between CAD+ vs.
  CAD−, and between DM+ vs. DM− in all CD4+ T cells. The thresholds set for the plots
  were adjusted p-value < 0.05, avg.Log2FC > 0 or <0, and pct.1 > 0.2. The size of
  dots represents log(pct.1/pct.2), where pct.1 is the proportion of cells expressing
  each gene in DM or CAD+ and pct.2 is the proportion of cells expressing each gene
  in DM− or CAD−. (D) Volcano plots comparing gene expression in single cells and
  Ingenuity Pathway analysis (−log10 p-value > 3) for gene expression in CD4+ T cells
  from male and female subjects. Red bar means positive Z-score, blue bar means negative
  Z-score.
