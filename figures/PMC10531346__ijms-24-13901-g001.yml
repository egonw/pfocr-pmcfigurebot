caption: (A) Flavonoid pathway. Starting with p-coumaroyl CoA from the monolignol
  pathway to yield the typical 15-carbon skeletal structure. CHS, Chalcone synthase;
  CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3′H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase; F3′5′H, flavonoid 3′5′-hydroxylase;
  F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; FNR, flavanone 4-reductase;
  ANS, anthocyanidin synthase; FNSI/II, flavone synthase I/II; FLS, flavonol synthase;
  ANR, anthocyanidin reductase; UFGT, UDP-glucose flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase.
  (B) The primary catalytic activity of DFR/FNR/ANR in the flavonoid pathways. dihydroflavonols
  to flavon-3,4-diols, flavanones to flavan-4-ols, and anthocyanidins to flavan-3-ols.
  B-ring hydroxylation differs between the substrates for each enzymatic reaction.
  The blue square, green triangle, and red circle denote reactions of DFR, FNR, and
  ANR, respectively.

  4-Reductase, Flavanone 4-Reductase, and Anthocyanidin Reductase Offer Metabolic
  Flexibility in the Flavonoid Pathway.
