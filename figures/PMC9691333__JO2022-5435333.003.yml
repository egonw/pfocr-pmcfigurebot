caption: Circ_0004488 binds to miR-136 and acts as a molecular sponge for miR-136.
  (a) Circ_0004488 and miR-136 were found to potentially interact in the CircInteractome
  database. (b) The difference in survival rates between patients with high and low
  miR-136 expression in cervical cancer. (c) The circ_0004488 biotinylated probe and
  a control probe were transfected into cervical cancer cells. Circ_0004488 expression
  was quantified by qRT-PCR after streptavidin capture. As a negative control, we
  employed miR-1248. (d) MiR-136 expression in miR-136 mimic or inhibitor transfected
  cervical cancer cells. (e) Cervical cancer cells were transfected with miR-136 mimics
  (or miR-136 inhibitor) and either wild-type (WT) or mutant (MUT) circ_0004488 luciferase
  reporter vectors, and the relative luciferase activity was evaluated. (f) qRT-PCR
  experiments were used to analyze miR-136 expression in cervical cancer cells treated
  with a circ_0004488 vector or circ_0004488 siRNA. (g) In order to determine circ_0004488
  and miR-136 expression in cervical cancer cells, the Ago2 RIP assay was performed.
  A qRT-PCR test was used to analyze circ_0004488 and miR-136 expression. ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
