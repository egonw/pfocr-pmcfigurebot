caption: 'FOXF2 enhances the stemness of luminal breast cancer cells but inhibits
  that of BLBC cells.A–C, the mRNA and protein levels of FOXF2 in the indicated cells
  were detected by RT-qPCR and immunoblot. 1st: first-generation mammospheres; 2nd:
  second-generation mammospheres. D and E, the mRNA (D) and protein (E) expression
  levels of stem cell–related markers in the indicated cells were detected by RT-qPCR
  and immunoblot. ∗, p < 0.05 compared with control cells. BLBC, basal-like breast
  cancers; RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR.'
article_title: FOXF2 oppositely regulates stemness in luminal and basal-like breast
  cancer cells through the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.
