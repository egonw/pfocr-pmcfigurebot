caption: IR combined with PD-L1 silencing and CQ treatment activated cGAS-STING pathway
  and the function of cytotoxic T lymphocytes(A and B) Western blot assay of cleaved-caspase3,
  Beclin-1, P62, LC3, and PD-L1 in LLC cells treated with IR, CQ, and si-PD-L1 (A) and
  their expression levels related to Tubulin (B).(C and D) Representative images (C) and
  fluorescence density (D) of cytosolic dsDNA in LLC cells treated with IR, CQ, and
  si-PD-L1. Scale bars, 5 μm.(E and F) Western blot assay of the expression level
  of p-IRF3, p-TBK1, STING, cGAS, and PD-L1 in LLC cells treated with IR, CQ, and
  si-PD-L1 (E) and their expression levels related to Tubulin (F).(G–I) RT-qPCR analysis
  of IFN-β, CXCL10, and CCL5 mRNA in LLC cells after the treatment of IR, CQ, and
  si-PD-L1.(J) Flow cytometry assay of the expression of MHC-I (H-2Kb) on the surface
  of LLC cells under the treatment of IR, CQ, and si-PD-L1, and the MFI value was
  represented on the right plot.(K) RT-qPCR analysis of IFN-γ mRNA in CTLL-2 cells
  that co-cultured with LLC cells after the treatment of IR, CQ, and si-PD-L1. ns,
  not statistically significant, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001 between indicated
  groups.
