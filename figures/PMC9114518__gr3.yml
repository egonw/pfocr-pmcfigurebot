caption: 'JAM-A is a regulator of Hippo signaling in primary cultured IEC(A) Representative
  confocal immunostaining of NF2 (green) and JAM-A (red) in WT murine 2D colonoids
  shows co-localization at the TJ. Scale bar, 20 μm.(B) Representative confocal immunostaining
  of LATS1 (green) and JAM-A (red) associating at the TJ in WT 2D murine colonoids.
  Scale bar, 20 μm.(C) JAM-AERΔIEC primary IEC exhibit prolonged nuclear YAP localization.
  Representative immunofluorescent images of YAP (green) and ZO-1 (red) in 2D colonoids
  cultured at low and high cell confluency derived from and JAM-AERΔIEC and JAM-Afl/fl
  mice. At low cell confluency YAP staining is visible in the nuclei of JAM-AERΔIEC
  and JAM-Afl/fl IEC. At high cell confluency, YAP localizes to the cytoplasm in control
  IEC but remains in the nuclei of JAM-AERΔIEC IEC, revealing a failure of Hippo signaling
  initiation. Graph depicts scoring of YAP localization (nuclear, cytoplasm, and nuclear +
  cytoplasm). Five fields of view for each condition were scored to generate an average
  percentage, and three independent experiments were performed (denoted by the dots).
  Scale bar, 20 μm.(D) JAM-A-deficient primary IEC exhibit decreased Hippo signaling
  activity. Representative western blots for p-LATS1 S909, LATS1, p-NF2 S518, NF2,
  p-YAP S127, YAP, and JAM-A in subconfluent 2D colonoids derived from JAM-AERΔIEC
  and JAM-Afl/fl mice. Graphs represent digital densitometry for relative density
  of p-NF2 S518, p-LATS1 S909, and p-YAP S127. JAM-AERΔIEC colonoids exhibit decreased
  NF2 and LATS1 activity, resulting in increased YAP activity relative to JAM-Afl/fl
  controls. Calnexin serves as a loading control. Data are means ± SEM of three independent
  experiments. ∗p ≤ 0.05, ∗∗p ≤ 0.01, ∗∗∗p ≤ 0.001: two-tailed Student’s t test.'
