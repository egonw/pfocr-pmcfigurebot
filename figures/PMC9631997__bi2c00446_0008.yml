caption: 'Kinetics of 8-oxo-dGMP bypass by apPol. (A) Acrylamide-urea gels depicting
  apPol-mediated single nucleotide incorporations to DNA substrate S2 in the presence
  of (from left) dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP. +1 and +2: primer strand extended by
  one and two nucleotides, respectively. Single nucleotide primer extension assays
  were set up at 37°C with a final concentration of 104 nM active apPol, 100 nM DNA
  substrate S2, and 250 μM of incoming dNTP. The reactions were incubated for varying
  time intervals ranging from 0 to 5 min (0, 0.33, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 min) following
  which an excess of EDTA was added to quench the reactions, and the samples were
  analyzed on 15% acrylamide-urea gels. (B,C) Global fitting of the time courses from
  primer extension assays to determine the efficiency of dCTP or dATP incorporation
  by apPol opposite 8-oxo-dGMP. Single nucleotide primer extension assays were performed
  as described for (A) with the following changes. The incoming nucleotide was either
  dCTP (B) or dATP (C), and the concentration of the nucleotide was varied from 62.5
  μM to 2 mM for dCTP addition (62.5 μM: black, 125 μM: orange, 250 μM: magenta, 500
  μM: green, 1 mM: red, and 2 mM: blue) and 125 μM to 2 mM for dATP addition (125
  μM: orange, 250 μM: magenta, 500 μM: green, 1 mM: red, and 2 mM: blue), and the
  maximum incubation time was 50 s. Due to the sequence of the T0 and T1 nucleobases
  in substrate S2, we could detect two dATP addition events. The time courses in (C)
  show the combined product concentrations (i.e., the total of the +1 and +2 products).
  The smooth lines overlaying the datapoints are the best global fit of the data.
  The rate constant governing dCTP or dATP addition (k3) and the affinity of the nucleotide
  for the binary complex (KDdNTP:8oxodG, where dNTP is either dCTP or dATP) are shown
  as insets with the corresponding graphs. (D) Kinetic pathway used for global fitting
  of the primer extension assays shown in (B,C). Rate constants shown in parenthesis
  were not allowed to float during global fitting. S2n: Substrate S2 with 23 nucleotide
  long unextended primer strand. S2n+1: Substrate S2 with the primer strand extended
  by one nucleotide. (E) Time courses from primer extension assays performed with
  DNA substrates S5 (red) and S6 (blue). Single nucleotide primer extension assays
  were performed as described for (A) with the following changes. The incoming nucleotide
  was dATP (final concentration 2 mM), and the maximum incubation time was 1 s. The
  time courses were fit to the full burst equation, and the rates of the fast phases
  are mentioned in the inset. All experiments were performed in triplicate, and the
  average of the three independent data sets is plotted in the graphs shown in (B,C,E),
  while the error bars represent the SD of data sets.'
