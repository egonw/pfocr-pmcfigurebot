figure_title: The metabolic route for aspartate synthesis in hypoxic pancreatic cancer
  cells
caption: a, Scheme of the focused CRISPR–Cas9 based genetic screen in a Ras mutant
  mouse PDAC line (HY15549) grown under normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic conditions (0.5%
  O2) for 14 population doublings (left). Top scoring genes and their differential
  gene scores in the focused CRISPR screen (right). b, Number of doublings (log2)
  of indicated parental, Got1 and Got2-knockout HY15549 cell lines expressing sgRNA-resistant
  GOT1 or GOT2 cDNA and grown for 5 days under normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic conditions
  (0.5% O2). c, Plot of gene score ranks of hypoxia and ETC inhibitor CRISPR screens
  in HY15549 cells. d, Scheme of the in vitro sgRNA competition assay performed in
  KRAS-mutant cancer cell lines transduced with a pool of five control sgRNAs (sgControl)
  and sgRNAs targeting five enzymes involved in aspartate metabolism (GOT1, GOT2,
  MDH1, MDH2 and PC) (left). Heat map showing median differential gene scores in the
  indicated cell lines on low oxygen (0.5% O2) or treatment with piericidin, an ETC
  inhibitor (right). e, Scheme depicting the oxidative (yellow) and reductive (blue)
  routes from which aspartate can be synthesized from glutamine, and the activation
  of each pathway by mito- and cyto-LbNOX enzymes. Filled circles represent 13C atoms
  derived from [U-13C]-l-glutamine (left). Oxidative (m + 4) to reductive (m + 3)
  aspartate ratio in HY15549 cell lines grown under 21% O2, 0.5% O2 or in the presence
  of piericidin (50 nM) (right). f, Relative fold change in cell number in HY15549
  cell lines transduced with a vector control, cyto-LbNOX or mito-LbNOX grown for
  5 days under 0.5% O2 or in the presence of piericidin (50 nM). b,e,f, Bars represent
  mean±s.d.; b,d,e,f, n = 3 biologically independent samples. Statistical significance
  was determined by a two-tailed unpaired t-test. NS, not significant.
