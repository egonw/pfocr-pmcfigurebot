caption: Chronic stress negatively affects lung cancer immunosurveillance via the
  kisspeptin‐KISS 1 receptor (KISS1R/GPR54) pathway. A) Representative locomotion
  tracks of the control and acute restraint (AR) mice in the open‐field test (OFT)
  and total locomotion (length of the track) were compared between the control and
  AR groups (n = 6). Flow cytometric (FCM) analysis of the proportions of B) splenic
  CD4+ central memory T cell (Tcm), C) CD4+ effector memory T cell (Tem), D) CD8+
  Tcm, E) CD8+ Tem, F) CD3+ T (n = 4–6) cell populations on day 18 after AR treatment.
  C57BL/6 mice after 18 days of AR treatment, purified splenic CD3+ T cells activated
  by α‐CD3/α‐CD28 for 72 h, then harvested cells for RNA‐seq analysis. Heatmap shows
  G) the expression levels of neuropeptides or neurotransmitters and T cell activation
  related genes, and H) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment
  analysis of the downregulated genes from the AR group compared with the control.
  Heatmap and KEGG analysis results were plotted using the OmicShare tools, a free
  online platform for data analysis (www.omicshare.com/tools). Gene expression levels
  of the hypothalamus Gpr54 and Kiss1 I) (n = 7–8) and J) splenic T cells Gpr54 on
  day 18 after AR were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
  (n = 8). K) Serum kisspeptin 1 levels after 18 days of AR were detected by enzyme‐linked
  immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (n = 3). C57BL/6 mice on day 18 after AR were then implanted
  with 106 LLC tumor cells by a subcutaneous injection, and the mice were subjected
  to AR treatment daily. L) The LLC tumor growth curves and the end‐point tumor sizes
  were represented (n = 6), and M) Gpr54 gene expression levels in the tumor‐infiltrating
  lymphocytes (TILs) were determined by qPCR (n = 6). N) Serum kisspeptin 1 levels
  at the tumor end‐point were detected by ELISA (n = 4). FCM analysis of the proportions
  of O) tumor CD45+, P) CD4+, Q) CD8+, R) PD‐1+ CD8+, and S) LAG‐3+ CD8+ cell populations
  at the tumor end‐point (n = 4–6). All data are from at least three independent experiments.
  Data are represented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 by an unpaired Student's t‐test.
