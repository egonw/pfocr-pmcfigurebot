caption: Byakangelicol suppressed the COX-2/NF-κB signaling pathway in vitro. (A)
  GO enrichment bar graph analysis. (B) Immunofluorescence staining of P65 in RAW264.7
  after intervention with TiPs and RANKL. (C and D) Western blot showing levels of
  P-P65, P65, P-IKBα and IKBα and after intervention with byakangelicol and quantitative
  analysis of P-P65/p65 and P-IKBα/IKBα. The data were represented as mean ± SD of
  three independent experiments. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01.
