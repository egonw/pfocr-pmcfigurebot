caption: VTN triggered the NF-κB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome. (a) Real-time PCR
  and (b) western blotting were performed to detect ASC, NLRP3, and caspase-1 expression
  in THP-1-derived macrophages with or without VTN treatment. Data represented the
  mean ± SD of three independent experiments; t-tests were used to analyze statistical
  significance; ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001. (c) Phosphorylation of NF-κB
  was detected in THP-1-derived macrophages in response to VTN stimulation for 1 hour.
  (d, e) IL-18 was analyzed by western blotting and ELISA in THP-1-derived macrophages
  treated with VTN for 1 h, followed by BAY 11-7085 stimulation for another 48 hours.
  Data represented the mean ± SD of three independent experiments; one-ANOVA was used
  to analyze statistical significance; ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001. (f) The schematic
  illustration for VTN-regulated cell pyroptosis.
