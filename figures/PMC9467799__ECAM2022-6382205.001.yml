caption: 'SSD dose-dependently attenuated inflammation of uterine and fallopian tube
  in SPID rats. 35 female rats were used for these experiments: Sham group (n = 8),
  SPID group (n = 6), high-dose SSD group (n = 8), low-dose SSD group (n = 6), and
  Fuke Qianjin Capsules (FQC) group (n = 7). After the SPID model was established,
  the rats in the high-dose SSD group and low-dose SSD group were intragastrically
  administered with 6.64 g/kg • day and 1.66 g/kg • day SSD, respectively. The rats
  in the FQC group were intragastrically administered with 0.22 g/kg • day after the
  suspension of FQC. The rats in the sham group and SPID group were given the same
  amount of normal saline. The contents of TNF-α (a) IL-1β (b) IL-6 (c) and IL-18
  (d) in serum samples of rats in each group were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
  assay (ELISA). (e) The numbers of WBCs and lymphocytes were counted under a microscope.
  (f) H&E stain was used to observe the pathological changes in the fallopian tube
  and uterine tissues. The magnification is 200× and 400×. Yellow arrow: vasodilation
  and hyperemia; green arrow: degeneration and necrosis of epithelial cells; blue
  arrow: lymphocyte; black arrow: endometrial lamina propria edema. H&E: hematoxylin
  and eosin; WBCs: white blood cells; TNF: tumor necrosis factor; IL: interleukin;
  SPID: sequela of pelvic inflammatory disease; SSD: Shipi Shugan Decoction; FQC:
  Fuke Qianjin Capsules. ∗P < 0.05 (versus sham), ∗∗P < 0.01 (versus sham), ∗∗∗P <
  0.001 (versus sham), #P < 0.05 (versus SPID), ##P < 0.01 (versus SPID), and ###P
  < 0.001 (versus SPID). Data represent the Mean ± SEM.'
