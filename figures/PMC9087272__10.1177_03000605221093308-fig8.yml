caption: 'Piperlongumine (PL) and vitamin C (VC) synergistically inhibited signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signalling in two gastric cancer
  cell lines in vitro: (a) AGS and KATO III cells were treated with PL (5, 10 µM)
  and VC (1 mM) alone or in combination for 24 h and then they were subjected to Western
  blot analysis to measure the protein levels of p-STAT3, STAT3 and survivin. β-actin
  served as an internal control; (b) the relative levels of protein compared with
  β-actin after treatment. Data presented as mean ± SD; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001;
  ns, not significant; analysis of variance.'
article_title: Piperlongumine combined with vitamin C as a new adjuvant therapy against
  gastric cancer regulates the ROS–STAT3 pathway.
