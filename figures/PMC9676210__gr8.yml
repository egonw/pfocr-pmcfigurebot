caption: 'Evaluation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in hGFs grown
  on JEM membranes. (a) Time course (min) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) curve
  plot for hGFs on JEM(+), JEM(−), and control membranes. hGFs were examined using
  the Seahorse Bioscience XF24. Quantification was performed for additional parameters,
  including (b) basal respiration, (c) maximal respiration, (d) proton leak, (e) ATP
  production, (f) spare respiration proton leak, and (g) mitochondrial respiration.
  (h and i) Western blot of mitochondrial proteins related to OXPHOS (Complexes I,
  II, III, IV, and V) in hGFs cultured on JEM(+), JEM(−), and control membranes at
  24 ​h. (j) Schematic illustration of mitochondrial OXPHOS in hGFs grown on the JEM(+)
  membrane. When the JEM(+) membrane acts on hGFs, OXPHOS increases and the electron
  transport chain in the mitochondrial inner membrane is activated. This metabolic
  pathway drives the synthesis and release of ATP as an energy source, which is expected
  to promote the proliferation and migration of hGFs. ∗p ​< ​0.05, compared with Control;
  #p ​< ​0.05, compared with JEM(+). Statistically significant differences (p ​< ​0.05)
  were measured using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) combined with the Student–Newman–Keuls
  (SNK) multiple comparison post hoc test, n ​= ​3.'
