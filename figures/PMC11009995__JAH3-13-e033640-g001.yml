figure_title: Pathway analysis of whole plasma aptamer‐based proteomics reveals modulated
  inflammatory signaling in endurance athletes with atrial fibrillation
caption: A, Principal component analysis demonstrated participant‐specific clustering
  of samples. B, All values from the 4 time points (ie, preexercise, midexercise,
  postexercise, recovery) in each individual were averaged. A total of 20 proteins
  were differentially expressed using filtering thresholds of q<0.05 and fold change
  >1.5 between those with AF and those without (dark red, higher in lone AF; dark
  blue, lower in lone AF), while 446 proteins were differentially enriched between
  the 2 groups, q<0.05 with no fold‐change cut‐off (light red, higher in lone AF;
  light blue, lower in lone AF). C, Selected KEGG, Reactome, INOH, PID, and BioCarta
  pathways that were significantly enriched among those proteins significantly increased
  across the endurance bout. D, Selected KEGG, Reactome, INOH, PID, and BioCarta pathways
  that were significantly enriched among those proteins significantly decreased across
  the endurance bout. AF indicates atrial fibrillation; FDR, false discovery rate;
  GPCR, G‐protein coupled receptor; JAK STAT, Janus kinase‐signal transducer and activator
  of transcription; IL, interleukin; INOH, Integrating Network Objects With Hierarchies;
  KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; and PID, Pathway Interaction Database.
