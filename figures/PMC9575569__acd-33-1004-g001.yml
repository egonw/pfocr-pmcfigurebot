caption: GNG5 levels within BC tissues and cells. (a) TCGA database analysis. (b)
  GNG5 expression within 88 BC cancer and corresponding noncarcinoma tissues was determined
  through qRT-PCR. (c and d) KM curve analysis was conducted for assessing overall
  survival and disease free survival in both groups. (e) GNG5 protein levels within
  BC as well as matched healthy samples in four cases were analyzed through WB assay.
  (f and g) Detection of GNG5 mRNA expression through qRT-PCR and WB assays within
  BC cells (BT549, MDA-MB-231, MCF7, MDA-MB-468) as well as healthy breast epithelial
  MCF10A cells. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. BC, breast cancer; GNG5, G protein
  subunit gamma 5; KM, Kaplan–Meier; qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time PCR; TCGA, The
  Cancer Genome Atlas; WB, Western blot.
article_title: G protein subunit gamma 5 promotes the proliferation, metastasis and
  glycolysis of breast cancer cells through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
