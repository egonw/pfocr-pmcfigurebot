caption: DELLA regulates the gene expression of the UV-B signaling pathway. (A–D)
  Quantitative reverse transcription PCR analyses of HY5, CHS, FLS, and UF3GT expression,
  respectively, in the Ler, rga-24, gai-t6, and rga-24 gai-t6 double mutants. Six-day-old
  constant white light-grown seedlings were transferred to UV-B for 1 h. The Actin2
  gene was analyzed as an internal control. Error bars represent the SE of three biological
  replicates. The letters ‘a’ and ‘b’ indicate statistically significant differences
  between the gene transcription level of the indicated seedlings grown in the presence
  of UV-B radiation, “c” represents no significant difference between these columns,
  as determined by Tukey’s least significant difference test (p < 0.05).
