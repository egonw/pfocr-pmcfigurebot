caption: SS induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in CRC cells. (A) Flow cytometry
  analysis to determine the cycle of SW620 cells after 4 h treatment in blank group,
  SS group (40 μM) and 5-FU group (0.7 mM). (B) Western blot analysis of CDK2 and
  p21 expression levels in SW620 cells after 24 h of incubation in the blank group,
  SS group (40 μM) and 5-FU group (0.7 mM). (C) Flow cytometry analysis to determine
  the apoptosis of SW620 cells in the blank group, SS group (40 μM) and 5-FU group
  (0.7 mM) after 24 h of culture. (D) Western blot analysis of the expression levels
  of cleave Caspase-3, Bcl2 and Cyt C in SW620 cells after 24 h of culture in the
  blank group, SS group (40 μM) and 5-FU group (0.7 mM). All experiments were performed
  three times independently. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
