caption: 'The Gene Expression Profile of ZFAS1-Overexpression Mice(A) Schematic diagram
  of RNA sequencing and target gene identification. (B) The production of cardiac-specific
  ZFAS1 knock-in mice is depicted throughout this diagram. (C) Volcano plot of the
  identified differentially expressed mRNAs. Red area:P < 0.05; fold change ≥2; blue
  area:P < 0.05, fold change ≤0.5. Benjamin-Hochberg was used to report the false
  discovery rate for the volcano plot and fold-change analyses. (D) Heat map of the
  differentially expressed mRNAs identified between TG and WT mice (red, up-regulated
  mRNAs; blue, down-regulated mRNAs). (E) The second level of differentially expressed
  genes identified with the use of Gene Ontology. (F) Heat map of mRNA involved in
  response to stress, apoptosis, protein binding, and other pathways. (G) Venn diagram
  for screening target genes. (H) Pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed
  genes (criterion: differentially expressed genes >2 and P ≤ 0.05) according to the
  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. TG = cardiac-specific ZFAS1 knock-in (transgenic);
  WT = wild-type; other abbreviations as in .'
