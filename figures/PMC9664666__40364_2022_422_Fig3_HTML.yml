caption: SGOL2 dysregulated the cell cycle by regulating MAD2 in HCC cells. A SK-HEP-1
  and HEP3B cells were transfected with shNC or shSGOL2, and the levels of PCNA, cyclin
  D1, cyclin E1, SGOL2, and MAD2 were detected by Western blots to study the effect
  of SGOL2 on cell cycle and MAD2. GAPDH was used as a loading control. B SK-HEP-1,
  and HEP3B cells were transfected with SGOL2 plasmid or vector control plasmid, and
  the levels of PCNA, cyclin D1, cyclin E1, SGOL2, and MAD2 were detected by Western
  blots. GAPDH was used as a loading control. C-D, Invasion and sphere formation of
  SGOL2-upregulated HCC cells with or without M2I-1 treatment were detected and analyzed.
  The results are presented as the mean ± SD, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001,
  ****P < 0.0001
article_title: SGOL2 is a novel prognostic marker and fosters disease progression
  via a MAD2-mediated pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma.
