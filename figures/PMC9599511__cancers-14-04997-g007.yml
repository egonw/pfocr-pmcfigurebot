caption: Prioritization of cancer drug targets for NSD3-amplified LUSC. (A) Heatmap
  showing the estimated half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of candidate
  therapeutic drugs calculated using the “pRRophetic” R package across the TCGA LUSC
  cohort (n = 491). The top 10 compounds ranked by the adjusted p-value are shown.
  The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for comparison, and p < 0.05 was considered
  significant. (B) Correlation analysis between the estimated IC50 values of candidate
  therapeutic drugs and pathway enrichment scores calculated using the “GSVA” R package.
  (C) Heatmap showing the Spearman correlation coefficients between the mRNA levels
  of NSD3 and a panel of UPR genes, which displayed an elevated expression pattern
  in NSD3-amplified LUSC. (D) Correlation analysis between the copy number of NSD3
  and CRISPR genetic knockout score of EIF4EBP1 and LSM1 across LUSC cell lines (n
  = 22). Data were downloaded from The Cancer Dependency Map Project (DepMap; 22Q2
  Chronos).
