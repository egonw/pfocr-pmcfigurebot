caption: 'Bioinformatic analysis on the mRNA sequencing (from GEO: GSW2803868) and
  western blotting assay on osteolysis model in vitro. A Statistical results of GO
  classification of network genes between groups. B KEGG pathway analysis. C Image
  of connection between pathways. D Protein expression bands of NFatc-1, Tab3, and
  NF-κB (P-p65/p65). E The gray values of bands in each group were quantitatively
  analyzed and compared (control group EXO-mimic-NC/wear particles EXO-mimic-NC + Ti
  group/EXO-miR-3470b mimic group/EXO-miR-3470b mimic + Ti group). Compared with the
  control group EXO-mimic-NC, *p < 0.05, *p < 0.01 indicated a statistical difference.
  Compared with EXO-mimic-NC + Ti, #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01indicates a statistical difference.'
