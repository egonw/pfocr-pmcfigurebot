caption: 'GBA targeting tryptophan: Peripheral serotonin synthesis by enterochromaffin
  cells is stimulated by gut microbiota. 5-HT from the gut has various direct or indirect
  effects, such as gut motility and gut microbiota. This affects central serotoninergic
  pathways by moderating Trp and tryptamine availability. Gut microbiota affect the
  kynurenine pathway, which plays a critical role in inflammatory mechanisms and neuroendocrine
  functions. Dietary Trp can also be directly converted by the gut microbiota into
  AhR ligands and can help to perform many functions. Trp; tryptophan; Kyn, kynurenine;
  KynA, kynurenic acid; quinolinic acid; 3HANA, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid; 3-HK, 3-hydroxykynurenine;
  5-HTP, 5-hydroxytryptophan, 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HIAA, 5-hydroxyindole acetic
  acid; AhR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor; EC, enterochromaffin cells.'
