caption: Effects of CSPG4P12 overexpression on migratory and invasive abilities of
  non-small cell lung cancer cells. Detection of (A) cell migration and invasion using
  Transwell assay (magnification, x100), (B) the results of which were quantified.
  (C) Detection and (D) quantification of cell migration using wound healing assay
  (magnification, x40). *P<0.05 and **P<0.01 vs. control. CSPG4P12, chondroitin sulfate
  proteoglycan 4 pseudogene 12; ns, not significant.

  lung cancer by Bcl‑2/Bax mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.
