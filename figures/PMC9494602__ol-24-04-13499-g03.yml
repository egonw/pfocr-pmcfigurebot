caption: miR-29a-3p inhibits the malignant characteristics of A549 NSCLC cells by
  decreasing the activity of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. (A) Reverse transcription
  quantitative-PCR was used to measure the expression of miR-29a-3p in A549 cells.
  (B) A Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was used to assess A549 cell proliferation 48 h
  after transfection. (C) Fluorescence staining using an EdU assay on A549 cells (scale
  bar, 50 µm). (D) A wound healing assay was used to assess the migratory ability
  of the transfected A549 cells (scale bar, 50 µm). (E) A Transwell invasion assay
  was to assess the invasive ability of A549 cells (scale bar, 50 µm). (F) Western
  blotting was used to measure the expression of Wnt3a and β-catenin in A549 cells.
  A549 cells were transfected with NC, or miR-29a-3p mimic, and subsequently treated
  with LiCl. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 vs. control group; &P<0.05, &&P<0.01 vs. miR-29a-3p
  mimic group. NC, negative control; NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer; miR, microRNA.
