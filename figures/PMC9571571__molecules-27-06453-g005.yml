caption: Sensitivity analysis of the investigated models based on their ability to
  identify known drugs. To validate the performance of our models, we compared their
  performance using three types of questions. (A,B) We found that models G and H achieve
  the highest sensitivity on generic questions. (A,B) Model F could be more suitable
  for the pathway question–answer category. (C) Our K-means clustering analysis indicates
  that the models separate based on their sensitivity into a cluster containing the
  B, C, and D models and another cluster containing the models’; A, E, F, H, and G.
