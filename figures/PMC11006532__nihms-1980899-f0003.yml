figure_title: MERRICAL-deficient macrophages inhibit pro-inflammatory responses and
  chemokine CCL3/CCL4 expression in vitro
caption: (A) Differential expression analysis using DEseq2 was applied to compare
  non-specific (NS) control gapmeR-treated BMDMs (M1 phase) with the MERRICAL gapmeR
  knockdown (KD) BMDMs (M1 phase).(B) IPA canonical pathway analysis from DEGs of
  MERRICAL KD BMDMs compared with NS controls.(C) GOChord plot showing the significantly
  regulated genes (log2 FC > 3, FDR < 0.05) involved in the top 7 enriched pathways
  when comparing MERRICAL KD BMDMs with NS controls.(D) Heatmap showing significantly
  regulated genes in the chemokine signaling pathway.(E) Overlap of significantly
  downregulated genes (from comparison of MERRICAL KD BMDMs with NS controls) with
  significantly upregulated genes (from aortic intimal RNA-seq of Ldlr−/− mice fed
  the HFSC diet, G3 progression versus control).(F) GOChord plot showing overlapping
  genes in (E) (log2 FC > 0.58, FDR < 0.05) involved in the top 7 enriched pathways.
