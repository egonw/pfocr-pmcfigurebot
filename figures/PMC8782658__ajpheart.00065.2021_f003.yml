caption: 'TNF-α induces ICAM-1 clustering dependent on NO signaling. A: confluent
  monolayers of EAhy926 cells were incubated with 1 nM TNF-α for 15 min and processed
  by immunofluorescence to detect ICAM-1 in the cell surface. The images are representative
  of 3 independent experiments. B: confluent monolayers of EAhy926 cells were incubated
  with 1 nM TNF-α for different times and membrane and cytosolic fractions were isolated,
  separated by PAGE-SDS, and probed with anti-ICAM antibodies. One-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s
  multiple comparison test, n = 3 independent experiments. C: confluent monolayers
  of EAhy926 cells were incubated with 1 nM TNF-α for different times in the presence
  or absence of l-NMA; ICAM-1 was immunoprecipitated and the interaction with cortactin
  evaluated by Western blot analysis. Two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test, *P < 0.05 in
  comparison to time 0, #P < 0.05 in comparison to the treatment with TNF-α; n = 4
  independent experiments. Data were normalized to band intensity seen at time 0.
  ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1; l-NMA, NG-methyl-l-arginine; NO, nitric
  oxide; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α.'
