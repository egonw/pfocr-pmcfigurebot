caption: Establishment of an I/R model and analyzing the protein expression levels
  of TIPE2. (A) AAR/LV and (B) and IA/AAR were quantitatively measured in the heart
  of mice from different groups. (C) FS (%), (D) LVDd and (E) LVDs were measured using
  echocardiography in the different groups of mice at baseline and 7/14 days after
  myocardial I/R injury. (F) TUNEL assay was used to detect the levels of myocardial
  apoptosis. (G) TIPE2 protein expression levels were analyzed in cardiac injury tissues
  following I/R at different reperfusion times. n=5 mice/group. Data are representative
  of three independent repeats per experiment. ***P<0.001 vs. sham. I/R, ischemia-reperfusion;
  TIPE2, TNF-α-induced protein 8-like protein 2; AAR, area at risk; LV, left ventricle;
  IA, infarct area; FS (%), fractional shortening of the left ventricle (%); LVDd,
  LVDs, left ventricular diameter of systolic.

  by decreasing cell autophagy via the mTORC1 signaling pathway.
