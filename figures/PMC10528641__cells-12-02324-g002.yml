caption: 'The transition of mammalian cardiomyocyte (CM) growth signaling pathways
  that convert proliferative fetal cardiomyocytes into hypertrophic adult cardiomyocytes.
  Top panel. The Hippo pathway is the primary fetal cardiomyogenic hyperplasia program
  (green) that regulates fetal CM number prior to birth (0 d). Birth triggers the
  perinatal transition program (yellow) that facilitates the conversion of fetal CM
  into adult hypertrophic CMs (red). MicroRNAs are excellent candidate molecules that
  propagate the CM perinatal transition. The mTOR pathway is the principal pathway
  that controls CM physiological hypertrophy. 0 d = time of birth and 14 d = 14 days
  post-birth. Bottom Panel: Highlights the differences between fetal (green) and adult
  (red) cardiomyocytes.'
