caption: Longitudinal pathway plot of a hypothetical patient with rectal cancer who
  underwent local excision. Rectal cancer was picked up on colonoscopy as indicated
  by the dark grey line, and treated by local excision as indicated by the orange
  circle. After a disease-free surveillance period of approximately 18 months, the
  patient had recurrence as shown by the first red arrow. This was followed by radiotherapy
  and chemotherapy prior to death. TNM, tumour, node, metastases.
