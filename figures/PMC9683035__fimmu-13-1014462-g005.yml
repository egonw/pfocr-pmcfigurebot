caption: (A) Lung ILC2 cells were isolated from papain-administrated mice treated
  with (n=5) or without (n=5) FK506 and were cultured in the presence of rIL-7 for
  12 h. Cytokine and chemokine levels in the cell supernatants were measured using
  MAGPIX System. (B) Pooled ILC2 cells were isolated from the lung of 20 unstimulated
  mice. Ten thousand cells were cultured on a 96-well plate in the presence of rIL-7
  for 40 h. The cells were activated with LTs, IL-33, or PMA + ionomycin treated with
  (n=5) or without FK506 (n=5). Levels of type 2 cytokines were assessed as described
  above. (C) The left panel indicates the expression of lipid mediator genes in AEC1
  cells (n=3), AEC2 cells (n=3), and basophils (n=3). The right-top panel indicates
  the expression of the LTB4 receptor in lung ILC2 cells as described in Figure 4.
  The right-bottom panel represents the biosynthetic pathway of LTB4. Bars represent
  the means; not significant (ns), *p–0.05, **p–0.01 using unpaired Mann-Whitney U-tests.
  All error bars represent the SEM.
