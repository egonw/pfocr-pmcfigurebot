caption: Model for the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation-mediated regulation of Pah1
  PAP location and mode of action of the enzyme at the nuclear/ER membrane via the
  hopping and scooting modes. Pah1 in the cytosol is phosphorylated by several protein
  kinases. The phosphorylated enzyme (gray circles) translocates to the nuclear/ER
  membrane via its recruitment and dephosphorylation by the Nem1-Spo7 protein phosphatase
  complex. Dephosphorylated Pah1 hops onto the membrane, scoots along the surface
  to bind its substrate, and catalyzes the dephosphorylated PA to produce DAG, which
  can be utilized in the formation of TAG stored in lipid droplets (LDs). Following
  the PAP reaction, Pah1 scoots along the membrane until it recognizes a PA molecule
  for another round of reaction. Pah1 catalyzing the PAP reaction is designated with
  blue color. PA is also converted to CDP-DAG for the synthesis of the membrane phospholipids
  PI, PS, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and PC. The phospholipids PE and PC may also
  be derived from DAG via the CDP-ethanolamine and CDP-choline branches of the Kennedy
  pathway when cells are supplemented with ethanolamine and/or choline. Further details
  of the lipid synthesis pathways may be found elsewhere (, , ). PA, phosphatidate;
  PAP, phosphatidate phosphatase; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PI, phosphatidylinositol;
  PS, phosphatidylserine.
