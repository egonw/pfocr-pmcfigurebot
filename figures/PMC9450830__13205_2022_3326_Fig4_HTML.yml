caption: p53-ASS1 pathway. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) induced phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3K) coverts phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol
  3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 is a lipid-derived second messenger that initiates
  PI3K signal relay by recruiting phosphatidylinositide-dependent protein kinase 1
  (PDK1) and Akt (protein kinase B). Akt is a key regulator of several downstream
  signalling pathways involved in cell survival, proliferation, metabolism and so
  on. In response to genotoxic stress, p53 directly transactivates argininosuccinate
  synthetase 1 (ASS1), which act as an intrinsic repressor of Akt (Miyamoto et al.
  )
