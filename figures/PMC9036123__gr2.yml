caption: 'BAG1L binding sites and regulation of androgen-mediated ROS gene expression
  Identification of BAG1L regulatory element in ARτ5(A) Mammalian one-hybrid assay
  in HeLa cells transfected with the indicated ARτ5 constructs linked to Gal4 DBD
  and increasing concentrations of BAG1L. The results are the mean of at least three
  independent experiments ±SEM, relative to the empty BAG1L expression vector. ∗p
  ≤ 0.05, ∗∗p ≤ 0.01 and ∗∗∗∗p ≤ 0.0001.(B) Mammalian two-hybrid assay performed in
  HeLa cells transfected with the indicated ARτ5 constructs linked to Gal4 DBD in
  the presence of BAG1L-VP16 fusion plasmid or VP-16 plasmid. The results show the
  mean of three independent experiments ±SEM ∗p ≤ 0.05 and ∗∗∗p ≤ 0.001. RLF stands
  for relative luciferase activity.(C–E) Quantitative RT-PCR showing androgen-mediated
  gene expression of BAG1L-target genes in LNCaP cells in the presence and absence
  of a control peptide (CPP-NLS) or the BAG1L binding site peptide (CPP-NLS-AR 385-405).
  The bar charts represent the average relative gene expression ±SEM (n = 4–7, ∗:
  p < 0.05, ∗∗: p < 0.01, ∗∗∗:< p 0.001, ∗∗∗∗: p < 0.0001). See also .'
