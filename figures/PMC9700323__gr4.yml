caption: Enhanced DNA protection ability of the YHSC for hadal adaptationGenes in
  red and blue underwent the expansion and positive selection in the YHSC, while genes
  in green and yellow refer to expanded and positively selected genes in P. swirei.(A–C)
  Mechanisms for restoring stalled and collapsed replication forks., Upon encountering
  obstacles, the replication fork stalled, and the ssDNA is generated and covered
  by replication protein A (RPA) to avoid secondary structure formation. The stalled
  fork can be rescued through the fork recovery pathway by activating the downstream
  effector CHK1 (A) or REV1-mediated translesion synthesis, (B). If the fork is not
  properly restarted, the replication fork collapses, one-ended double-strand breaks
  are induced and the fork is repaired by homologous recombination (C). (A) In the
  fork recovery pathway, the ssDNA-RPA complex recruits some proteins., Meanwhile,
  BRCA2 catalyzes the formation and stabilization of RAD51-ssDNA filaments, which
  protects nascent DNA from MRE11-mediated nucleolytic degradation., Then, CHK1 is
  activated with the help of G2E3, and the replication fork restarts after obstacle
  removal., (B) In the translesion synthesis pathway, RAD18 and RAD6 interact with
  the ssDNA-RPA complex and then ubiquitinate proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA).
  REV1, which possesses a high affinity for ubiquitinated PCNA, is recruited to lesions
  and mediates translesion synthesis by interacting with Polζ and one of the three
  Y-family polymerases (Polι, Polη, and Polκ), and selecting the polymerases required
  for translesion synthesis., (C) In the homologous recombination pathway, the RAD51
  filament facilitates strand invasion and homologous recombination after binding
  with RAD51AP1.(D) Phylogeny based on proteins containing the BRCA2 repeat domain
  (BRCA2) showed expansion of BRCA2 in the YHSC genome.(E) A gene tree of G2E3 constructed
  by Orthofinder (version 2.3.8).(F) Phylogenetic tree based on protein sequences
  containing DEAD/DEAH box helicases (DEAD). RecQ family labeled with an arc was not
  further subdivided, as different members could not be distinguished from each other.
  Nevertheless, 49 genes from the YHSC were annotated as WRN, far more than those
  from other species.(G) Phylogeny built with proteins containing the impB/mucB/samB
  family C-terminal domain (IMS_C) showing the expansion of the REV1 gene.(H) Nucleotide
  excision repair pathway. In the presence of DNA lesions, XPC or RNA Pol II loads
  TFIIH onto DNA, which is promoted by XPA. Upon detection of a bulky lesion, XPF-ERCC1
  and XPG make dual incisions.(I) Multiple sequence alignment of XPC. XPC underwent
  convergent positive selection in the hadal YHSC and P. swirei. Amino acids unique
  to the YHSC or P. swirei are indicated by arrows.
