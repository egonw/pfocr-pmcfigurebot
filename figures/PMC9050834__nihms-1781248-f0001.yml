figure_title: Methylmalonic Acid is upregulated in breast cancer metastasis
caption: a, b, Heat map (a) and metabolic pathway enrichment analysis (b) of the statistically
  significantly altered metabolites (FDR≤0.05) in 4T1 primary tumors and pulmonary
  metastases (n=4 biologically independent samples). c, Schematic representation of
  propionate metabolism. d, Methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels in 4T1 primary tumors
  and pulmonary metastases (n=4, two-tailed t-test). e, MMA levels in 4T1 (broadly
  metastatic) and 4TO7 (locally invasive) clones with different metastatic potential
  derived from a single primary tumor (n=5 biologically independent samples, two-tailed
  t-test). f, MMA levels in breast epithelial and breast cancer cell lines (n=5 biologically
  independent samples). All values are expressed as mean ± SEM.
