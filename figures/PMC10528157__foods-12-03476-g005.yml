caption: The differential metabolites were further elucidated by the KEGG signaling
  pathways, and the top 20 KEGG pathways of DLY-LD vs. CB-LD and DLY-PM vs. CB-PM
  comparisons were displayed. (A) Topological analysis of metabolic signaling pathways
  identified in longissimus dorsi muscle (n = 10) metabolites from Duroc × Landrace
  × Yorkshire (DLY), and Chuanzang black (CB) pigs; (B) Topological analysis of metabolic
  signaling pathways identified in psoas major muscle (n = 10) metabolites from DLY
  and CB pigs. The advanced bubble chart shows the degree of differentially rich metabolites
  in signaling pathways. The x-axis presents the rich factor (rich factor = the enrichment
  of different metabolites concentrated in the KEGG pathway/the enrichment of all
  metabolites in the background metabolites data set). The y-axis presents the concentrated
  KEGG pathway. The size of the bubble indicates the amount of differential abundance
  metabolites enriched in this pathway, and the color indicates the significance of
  enrichment.
