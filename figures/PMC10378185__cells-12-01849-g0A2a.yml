caption: 'Statistics evaluating the transcriptional activity of 25 KEGG pathways as
  biomarkers of growth rate (columns with prefix ‘r’) and carrying capacity (columns
  with prefix ‘K’): The 25 pathways were chosen because they were identified as differentially
  expressed between r/K-selected HeLa cells under low-density culture conditions [].
  For each pathway, a linear regression model was fitted to predict the respective
  growth parameter (r or K) from pathway activity level measured in the same cell
  line (columns with suffix ‘r.squared’ and ‘p.value’). Analysis was performed across
  five gastric cancer cell lines used as training dataset (HGC-27, KATOIII, NCI-N87,
  NUGC-4, and SNU-668). The top 5 pathways’ predictive growth rates and top five pathways’
  predictive carrying capacities (names in bold) were prioritized during training
  and further used in B for validation with an extended dataset. p-values are color-coded
  depending on whether the respective pathway and growth parameter were positively
  (purple) or negatively (blue) correlated in the training dataset.'
