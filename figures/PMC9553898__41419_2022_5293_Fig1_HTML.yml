figure_title: Estrogen mediates activation of mTORC1 signaling in the vaginal epithelium
caption: 'A GSEA enrichment plots of mTORC1 signaling in vaginal biopsies transcriptome
  from 19 menopausal women with vaginal dryness pre and post 3-month E2 treatment
  (GSE11622). B Serum E2 level in mice during proestrus (n = 5), estrus (n = 8), metestrus
  (n = 15), and diestrus (n = 10). Values are expressed as the mean ± SEM. C Cytological
  assessment of vaginal smears using the crystal violet staining method for estrous
  cycle determination in 8-wk-old WT mice. n = 5 in each group. Microscopy with magnification
  ×20. Scale bars: 100 μm (Upper). Representative images of the immunofluorescence
  staining for Raptor (Middle) and Phospho-S6 (Ser235/236) (lower) in mouse vagina
  during proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus. n = 5 in each group. Nuclei were
  stained with DAPI. Microscopy with magnification ×20. Scale bars: 75 μm. D, E Representative
  images of the Raptor (D) or p-S6(Ser235/236) (E) immunofluorescence staining in
  the vagina of OVX mice with sesame oil (n = 3) and E2 administration (n = 3). The
  experiments were repeated three times. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Microscopy
  with magnification ×20 (Upper) and ×63 (Lower). Scale bars: 75 μm.'
