caption: '(A) Scheme representing the enzymes and the metabolites involved in the
  fluxomic experiment, which covers the cytosolic moiety of the heme biosynthetic
  pathway. (B) NMR monitoring of the flux experiment. This figure includes the overlay
  of a series of experiments and also a diagram with the time evolution of the different
  intensities (in red). The top section of the experiment shows the signals for ALA,
  PBG, and the side chains of the porphyrins (not resolved), as indicated. The bottom
  spectra correspond to the aromatic region to show characteristic chemical shifts
  of the uroporphyrinogen III and coproporphyrinogen III formation. Color code: blue
  for time zero and green for end-of-reaction time. (C) Cylinder plot to represent
  the accumulation of metabolites (in the steady-state level of intermediates) between
  the control and the PBG-doped flux reactions. For a given metabolite, the cylinders
  represent the difference in the integral between the two reactions. Color code:
  metabolite accumulation/deficiency in the PBG-doped reaction is represented in red/aquamarine.'
