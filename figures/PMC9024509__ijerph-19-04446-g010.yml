caption: Prediction of the differential function of bacterial associations between
  the Nâˆ’Anti (orange) and Anti (blue haze) groups in KEGG categories at level 1 (a)
  and level 2 (b). Gene functions were predicted from 16S rRNA gene-based microbial
  compositions using the PICRUSt algorithm to make inferences from KEGG annotated
  databases. Relative signal intensity was normalized by the number of the genes for
  each indicated metabolic pathway. *, **, *** indicate the difference is at a significant
  level with p < 0.05, p < 0.01, and p < 0.001, respectively.
