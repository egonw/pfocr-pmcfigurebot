caption: Expression levels of genes involved and in the UVR8 pathway (HY5, COP1) and
  in phenolic biosynthesis (PAL, CHS, FLS) in (a,c,e,g,i) leaves and (b,d,f,h,j) roots
  of control (CTR) and UV-treated (UV) Micro-Tom tomato plants after 8 and 11 days
  of UV treatment (8 d and 11 d) and after 3 days from the end of the irradiation
  (rec). Data are mean ± SE of 3 biological replicates. According to each day, asterisks
  (*) indicate a significant difference between CTR and UV group (* p ≤ 0.05, ** p
  < 0.01, *** p < 0.001).
