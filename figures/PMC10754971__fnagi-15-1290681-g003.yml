caption: APTX KO affects cytosolic DNA immune stimulation. (A) Cytosolic DNA sensing
  pathways affected by APTX KO and IS. Rendered KEGG pathway plots in  identified
  genes that were down- (Red) and up- (green) regulated in APTX KO cells compared
  to WT (q < 0.05). With immune stimulation many similar genes are upregulated in
  both cell lines, but those that were uniquely upregulated in WT but not in APTX
  KO cells are marked blue (q < 0.05). Post DNA stimulation, RNA was harvested from
  cells and the levels of IFNβ (B), CXCL10 (C) and IL-8 (D) were quantified. Cells
  were also stained for IRF (green) post cytosolic DNA stimulation, and microscope
  images (E) quantified for nuclear IRF translocation (G). Similarly, cells were stimulated
  with cGAMP, and microscope images (F) were quantified for nuclear IRF translocation
  (H). Scalebar = 50 μm. Graphs show mean ± SEM, analyzed by two-way ANOVA, where
  significance is scored as ns p > 0.05, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
