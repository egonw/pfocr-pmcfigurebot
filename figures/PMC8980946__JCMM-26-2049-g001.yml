caption: STAT interactions in breast cancer, TNBC and prostate cancer. STAT interactions
  in two of the five most common death‐causing cancers listed by the WHO; breast cancer
  and prostate cancer, as well as the breast cancer subtype TNBC. Any interaction
  shared between two or more STATs is grouped in the middle, and the edges connecting
  those interactions are highlighted. Proteins for which a label is shown are those
  which are reported to be over‐expressed in that disease. Although not all proteins
  directly interact with each other, they may communicate indirectly through hub proteins.
  The proteins important for indirect communication are identified as ‘central’ to
  the networks and have a yellow halo in the network maps. Centrality measures how
  important the protein is for communication between the STAT interactome. It is measured
  using an undirected all‐pairs shortest path algorithm which measures how many of
  the shortest paths between proteins pass through a node. Therefore, proteins which
  are more central act as hubs through which signals are efficiently transmitted from
  one end of the interactome to the other. The centrality of a protein is proportional
  to the size of the yellow halo
