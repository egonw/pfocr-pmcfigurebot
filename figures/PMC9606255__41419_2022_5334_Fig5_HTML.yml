figure_title: Silencing TAB182 expression significantly reduces the stemness of ESCC
  cells
caption: A The DNA microarray results were further confirmed using real-time quantitative
  PCR (QT-PCR). B expression levels of ALDH1A1, SOX2, Nanog, BMI1 and Oct4 were quantitatively
  measured using QT-PCR. C the expression of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway downstream
  genes, as analyzed by western blot. D TOP/FOP luciferase reporter assays were performed
  in KYSE-150-shNC and KYSE-shTAB182 cells. Luciferase activity was measured 48 h
  after co-transduced with TOP/FOP flash plasmid. E the formation of tumor spheres
  was performed to evaluate the stemness of KYSE-150 and TE-10 cells. Average number
  of tumor spheres formed with knockdown of TAB182 were counted at 96 h. F, expression
  levels of ALDH1A1, SOX2, Nanog, BMI1 and Oct4 were quantitatively measured using
  qRT-PCR. G the protein levels of CD133, ALDH1A1, BMI1, p75NGF and SOX2 were detected
  in TE10, KYSE-150 and ECA109 cells by immunoblotting. H the percentage of ALDH1A1
  positive TE10 and KYSE-150 cells was analyzed using FACS. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01.
