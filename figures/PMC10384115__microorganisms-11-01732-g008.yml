caption: Molecular docking of CuaD and CuaA models. (A) Best-scoring result of cellobiose
  in CuaD model obtained by molecular docking. The cellobiose is colored yellow. The
  molecular docking of the complex CuaD–cellobiose reveals hydrophobic stacking with
  Trp262 and hydrophobic head interaction with Trp86 (in cyan). H-bonding interaction
  is observed with Lys36, Glu137, and Arg377 (also in cyan). (B) Best-scoring result
  of cellopentaose in CuaA model obtained by molecular docking. The cellopentaose
  is colored yellow. A longer pocket is observed with multiple hydrophobic interactions
  involving Trp48, Trp254, Tyr279, Trp275, Trp384, and Phe104 in the upper part and
  Trp304, Val102, Leu386, and Leu136 at the bottom of the pocket. H-bonding interactions
  are observed with the main chain around Ser385, Asp213, Glu101, Arg206, and His210.
  Visible residues in cyan are underlined.
