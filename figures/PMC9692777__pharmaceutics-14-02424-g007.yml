caption: Activation of the TLR3-IRF3 pathway in response to SCR-siRNA administration
  in LNCaP (a,b) and PC3 (c,d) cells. Effect of the TLR3 inhibitor (R)-2-(3-chloro-6-fluorobenzo[b]thiophene-2-carboxamido)-3-phenylpropanoic
  acid (TI; 10 µM) on phosphorylation of IRF3 (pIRF3) induced by treatment of LnCaP
  and PC3 cells with nanocomplexes formulated from AMC11 (1 µM) + SCR-siRNA (100 nM)
  (Npsi) in both cytosolic (a,c) and nuclear (b,d) cellular fractions. Data are expressed
  as mean ± SEM from 6 to 12 determinations from at least 3 independent experiments.
  * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001 compared with vehicle-treated cells (V).
