caption: The response of wild-type and mutant sperm to pronase. (A) Genetic model
  of the try-5 pathway of sperm activation. Bar indicates negative regulation, and
  arrows indicate positive regulation. (B) Model of pronase-induced sperm activation.
  Extracellular pronase cleaves unidentified transmembrane protein(s) on the sperm
  plasma membrane, triggering a signal in the cytosol that promotes activation. (C)
  him-5(e1490) mutant sperm with a wild-type copy of zipt-7.1, and zipt-7.1(ok971);
  him-5(e1490) mutant sperm were dissected from males and treated with pronase. Values
  are mean±s.d. of the percentage of sperm displaying activation based on morphology
  (n=3 biological replicates with ≥100 sperm per sample). (D) him-5(e1490) mutant
  sperm with a wild-type copy of zipt-7.1 were treated with 0 or 200 µg/ml pronase,
  0 or 100 µM TPEN, and 0 or 100 µM EDTA. Values are mean±s.d. (n=3 biological replicates
  with ≥100 sperm per sample). (E,F) Wild-type, spe-8(hc50) or snf-10(hc194) mutant
  sperm were analyzed as described for C. (G,H) Wild-type and snf-10(hc194) mutant
  sperm were dissected from males and treated with supplemental zinc as described
  for  (G) or treated with pyrithione as described for  (H). Experiments in E-G and
  , and H and  were conducted in parallel, and each pair has identical values for
  wild type. E-G and  have identical values for snf-10(lf) and spe-8(lf) with no activator,
  respectively. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ****P<0.0001 (Student’s t-test).
