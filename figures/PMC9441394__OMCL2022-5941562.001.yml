caption: EID3 is highly expressed in osteosarcoma cell lines. (a) Western blot analysis
  of EID3 expression in osteosarcoma cells and osteoblast cell line. (b) Analysis
  of EID3 mRNA expression in different osteosarcoma cells. (c) Western blot analysis
  of EID3 expression in adhere cultured or sphere-cultured osteosarcoma cell lines.
