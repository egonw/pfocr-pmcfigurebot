caption: 'HUA inhibits the protein level of the NRF2/SLC7A11/GPX4 signaling pathway
  in atherosclerotic plaque from HFD-treated ApoE−/− mice. The protein level of the
  NRF2/SLC7A11/GPX4 signaling pathway was assessed by immunofluorescence staining.
  (a–c) Representative immunostaining of NRF2, SLC7A11, and GPX4 in aortic atherosclerotic
  lesions in HUA+HFD versus HFD group. (d–f) Quantification of the mean fluorescence
  intensity for NRF2, SLC7A11, and GPX4. Data are means ± SD, 3 cross-sections/mouse,
  n = 3. HFD: high fat diet; HUA: high level of uric acid; HUA+HFD: high level of
  uric acid and high fat diet group. ∗∗P < 0.01 and ∗∗∗P < 0.001.'
