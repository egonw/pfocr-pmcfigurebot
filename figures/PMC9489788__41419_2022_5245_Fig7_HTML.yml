figure_title: Circ_0003215 inhibits the tumor growth and metastasis of CRC in vitro
caption: A Schematic flowchart of the subcutaneous tumor formation assay (left). Images
  of the dissected subcutaneous tumors from the tumor-bearing mice at the end of experiment
  (right). B Growth curves of xenograft tumors measured every 3 days (n = 5/group).
  C The final weight of the xenograft tumor was shown in the the scatter plot. D HE
  staining of the subcutaneous tumors (×100, ×400). E Expression of DLG4 and Ki67
  in subcutaneous tumors assessed by IHC. F RT-qPCR analysis of relative expression
  of circ_0003215 and miR-663b in subcutaneous tumors. G Measurement of lung weight
  in the tail vein-lung colonization model (left). Analysis of the lung metastatic
  nodules under the microscope (right). H Schematic representation of the metastasis
  assay model (left). Representative images from the lungs and metastatic nodules
  (right). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
