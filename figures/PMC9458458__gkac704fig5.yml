caption: 'CFIm APA regulation in the PI3K/Akt pathway. (A) Tabulated APA status of
  genes designated as part of the PI3K/Akt pathway by KEGG, or the Akt signalling
  cascade by GO, from our NIH3T3 3′UTR-seq. No APA: genes with no detectable alterative
  3′UTR isoform. CFIm NR: genes not responsive to CFIm KD. CFIm Resp: genes with detectable
  switch in 3′UTR isoform usage upon CFIm KD. (B) Schematic of the PI3K/Akt cascades.
  Genes responsive to CFIm KD are circled and shaded in gray, with example genes in
  brackets. Genes non-responsive to CFIm KD but with more than one detectable 3′UTR
  isoform are circled without shading. Genes with no detectable APA are not circled
  nor shaded. (C, D) RED scores (C) and 3''UTR-seq gene tracks (D) of core PI3K/Akt
  components Pten, Pik3ca, Pik3r3 and Akt3, upon CFIm KD in NIH3T3.'
article_title: Distinct, opposing functions for CFIm59 and CFIm68 in mRNA alternative
  polyadenylation of Pten and in the PI3K/Akt signalling cascade.
