caption: Functional annotation of KRAS-Mut subtypes by phosphoproteome analysis. (A)
  Heatmap shows the representative biological pathways among KM1, KM2 and KRAS-WT
  subgroups in RNA, protein, phosphoprotein level of CPTAC cohort. (B) The representative
  differential proteins expression level in KM1 or KM2 versus KRAS-WT, respectively.
  The color represents the ratio of level in different subgroup. (C) The volcano plot
  of differential phosphorylation sites in KM1 versus KM2. Blue and red points represented
  significantly differential phosphoprotein in M1 and M2 subtype, respectively. X-axes
  showed log2 (fold change) and y-axes showed -log10 (adjusted P value). (D) The expression
  of phosphorylated protein sites in KM1 and KM2 groups were applied to perform pathway
  and process enrichment analysis via Metascape. (E) Enriched kinases in KM1 and KM2
  subsets using KSEA with a significance of P < 0.05. Blue bars represent enriched
  in KM1; Red bars enriched in KM2.
