caption: ASCT2-mediated glutaminolysis governs the proinflammatory SASP of senescent
  HSCs. (A) Schematic diagram of glutaminolysis. (B–E) Steady-state metabolite levels
  of glutamate, α-KG and GSH levels were measured using kits (n = 3–15 per group).
  (F–I) TCA cycle metabolites citrate, malate, fumarate and succinate levels were
  measured using kits (n = 5 per group). (J) Intracellular ATP production was determined
  using a kit (n = 6 per group). (K) OCR was determined and the basal respiratory
  rate and maximum respiration rate were quantified by seahorse assay (n = 3 per group).
  (L–O) mRNA levels of the proinflammatory SASP factors IL1A, IL1B, IL6, and IL8 were
  measured by real-time PCR after α-KG supplementation (n = 5 per group). Bars indicate
  mean ± SEM; ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01.
