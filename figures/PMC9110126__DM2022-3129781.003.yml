caption: 'Curcumin enhance miR-222-3p to inhibit SOX10 via inactivating Notch pathway.
  (a) The proliferation of A375 and HT144 cells in each group was detected by MTT.
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. Control group, ##P < 0.01 vs. curcumin group. (b) The invasion
  ability of A375 and HT144 cell in each group was detected by transwell. (c) The
  expression of SOX10, Notch1, and and HES1 in A375 and HT144 cell groups was detected
  by Western blot. (d) A model of the molecular mechanism of the curcumin/miR-222-3p/SOX10/Notch
  signaling pathway.'
