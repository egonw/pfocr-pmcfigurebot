caption: Innate immune response to viral infection; effect of SARS-CoV and SARS-COV-2
  PLpro on NF-KB and IRF3 signaling. Viruses activate pattern recognition receptors
  (PRRs) which lead to phosphorylation and dimerization of IRF3, causing its nuclear
  translocation and transcriptional activation of type-I interferon. Type I interferon
  can activate JAK-STAT1 signaling leading to synthesis of interferon stimulated genes
  (ISGs).NF-KB pathway is also activated in viral infection which leads to a pro-inflammatory
  response. SARS-CoV PLpro is a strong deubiquitinase; it inhibits NF-KB signaling
  by preventing proteasomal degradation of IKB.SARS-CoV-2 PLpro is a strong deISGylase,
  modulates IRF3 activity by deISGylation.
