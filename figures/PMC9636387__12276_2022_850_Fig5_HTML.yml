figure_title: Knockout of NF-1 improved neuronal differentiation and enhanced the
  mTORC2 pathway in transplanted neural stem cells (NSCs) in vivo
caption: 'a Tile scan images of spinal cord injury with immunofluorescence staining
  of neural markers (NF-200 and GFAP) (scale bar = 500 µm). b, c Immunofluorescence
  staining of green fluorescent protein (GFP), neurofilament outgrowth marker (NF-200),
  and astrocyte marker (GFAP) (scale bar = 100 µm). d Quantitative comparisons (positive
  rates) of NF-200- and GFAP-positive cells in different groups. e Western blotting
  of mTORC2 signaling pathway-related proteins (neurofibromin, P-mTOR, and Rictor),
  neural differentiation proteins (NF-200, MAP2, β3-Tubulin, and GFAP), and GAPDH.
  f Quantitative comparisons of the expression levels of neurofibromin, P-mTOR, Rictor,
  NF-200, MAP2, β3-Tubulin, and GFAP in different groups (data are expressed relative
  to GAPDH). *P < 0.05 compared with the SCI+LV-vector NSC group; #P < 0.05 compared
  with the SCI+LV-NF-1+LV-Rictor NSC group.'
