caption: Type 1 immunity and metabolism. (A) Metabolic regulation of type 1 immune
  function. Glycolysis promotes and OXPHOS inhibits M1 macrophage polarization. Both
  glycolysis and OXPHOS metabolic pathway (aerobic glycolysis) support Th1 differentiation
  and function. (B) Type 1 immune regulation of metabolic function. Inflammatory cytokines
  such as IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 provoke systemic insulin resistance. IL-6 induce
  lipid oxidation in muscles. Type 1 interferon inhibits insulin resistance and obesity.
  Type 1 interferon promotes glucose uptake in embryonic fibroblast and fatty acid
  oxidation in plasmacytoid DC.
