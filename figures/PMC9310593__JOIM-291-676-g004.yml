caption: 'Altered expression of genes and intracellular signalling pathways in peripheral
  blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients. (A) mRNA
  expression of cardiovascular disease and inflammation‐related molecules in PBMCs
  from PsA patients and healthy donors (HDs). (b) Intracellular signalling pathways
  array in PBMCs from PsA patients and HDs. TNF‐α, tumor necrosis factor alpha; TNFRSF10C,
  TNF receptor superfamily member 10c; LTBR, lymphotoxin beta receptor; IL‐6, interleukin
  6; IL‐1RT2, interleukin 1 receptor type 2; GDF‐15, growth differentiation factor
  15; MMP‐9, matrix metallopeptidase 9; vWF, Von Willebrand factor; TFPI, tissue factor
  pathway inhibitor; CHI3L1, chitinase 3 like 1; CCL‐15, C‐C motif chemokine ligand
  15; PI3, peptidase inhibitor 3; JAM‐A (F11R), junctional adhesion molecule 1 (F11
  receptor); CTSD, cathepsin D; CD‐163, cluster differentiation 163; GAL‐3 (LGALS3),
  galectin 3 (lectin, galactoside binding, soluble 3); FABP‐4, fatty acid binding
  protein 4; ERK1/2, extracellular signal‐regulated kina½1/2; AKT, protein kinase
  B; S6, subunit 6; MTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; PRAS40, proline‐rich
  akt substrate. Error bars represent standard deviation of the mean. *Significant
  differences: p <0.05; **significant differences: p < 0.01; ***significant differences
