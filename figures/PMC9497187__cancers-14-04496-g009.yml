caption: A sphingolipid pathway map depicting the log2 transformed fold changes in
  transcript, protein, and metabolite (sphingolipid) levels in MDA–MB–231 cells in
  comparison to BT–474 cells. For each gene, the corresponding transcript and protein
  fold changes are denoted as color-coded boxes below the gene name (transcript at
  the left and protein at the right of the box). In case of lipids, circles are used
  to describe the fold changes for a particular chain length. The color keys given
  in the legend box describe the color scale of different bins of log2 (fold change)
  that represents the degree of upregulation or downregulation in gene/protein/metabolites
  between cell lines The dashed boxes (A–E) indicate the de novo pathway (A) and various
  salvage pathways (B–E).
