caption: Skeletal muscles (SkM) of old mice have high p21-expressing myofibers with
  a senescence profile. (a) Comparison of p21 expression between young and old SkM
  tissue (n = 7 for both young and old samples) and isolated mononuclear cells (n
  = 7 for both young and old samples) by qPCR, mononuclear cells by scRNA-seq (n =
  7 for both young and old samples), and isolated myofibers by qPCR (n = 5 for both
  young and old samples, two-tailed unpaired t tests). (b) Western blot of P21 and
  GAPDH in quadriceps muscle from young and old female mice (n = 4 per group). P21/GAPDH
  represents the ratio of the P21 signal intensity compared to GAPDH for each sample.
  (c) RNA-ISH staining of p21 and IF staining for Laminin in young and old quadriceps
  muscle cross-sections (n = 4 per group). (d) Quantification of the percentage of
  young and old myofibers staining positively for p21 puncta (two-tailed unpaired
  t test) and (e) the percentage of young and old myofibers with 0 to greater than
  10 puncta. (f) Analysis of p21 expression by qPCR in 159 young and 159 old isolated,
  individual myofibers from female mice. (g) Differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
  between young, old p21low, and old p21high myofibers identified in the RNA-seq.
  (h) Venn diagram of DEGs between the three groups of myofibers. (i) Enriched pathways
  in old p21low compared to old p21high myofibers identified by GSEA, negative NES
  represent pathways enriched in old p21low myofibers. GSEA plot of (j) KEGG cytokine-cytokine
  receptor interactions and (k) the KEGG p53 signaling pathway based on DEGs between
  old p21high and old p21low myofibers. (l) Heatmap of the core DEGs in cytokine-cytokine
  receptor interactions and the p53 signaling pathway. GSEA plots of transcripts within
  the CellAge gene set that are positively correlated with senescence and are DEGs
  between (m) old p21high and old p21low myofibers, or (n) old p21low and young myofibers.
  Two-tailed unpaired t test was used; error bars represent the standard error of
  the mean. * and *** denote p < 0.05 and 0.001 respectively.
