caption: 'MgIG modifies HRZE-induced gut microbiota composition. (a) Venn diagram
  of the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) distribution; (b) the Shannon index of α-diversity-there
  are significant letters above each group, and there is a statistical difference
  between different letters (p < 0.05); (c) principal component analysis (PCA) of
  β diversity; (d,e) species composition analysis at the phylum level; (f) the abundance
  ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/B). The data are presented as the means
  ± SEM (n = 6). Compared with the control group: * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01. Abbreviations:
  C, control group; H, HRZE group; HMg, HRZE + MgIG group.'
