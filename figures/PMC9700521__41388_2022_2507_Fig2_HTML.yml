caption: A RT–qPCR results of OTUB1 mRNA expression in AGS (left panel) or MKN28 (right
  panel) cell line transfected with scrambled or two independent siRNA targeting OTUB1
  for 48 h, respectively. B Western blot results showing the expression level of YAP
  and OTUB1 in AGS (left panel) or MKN28 (right panel) cell line transfected with
  scrambled or two independent siRNA targeting OTUB1 for 48 h, respectively. C RT–qPCR
  results of CTGF and CYR61 mRNA expression in AGS (left panel) or MKN28 (right panel)
  cell line transfected with scrambled or two independent siRNA targeting OTUB1 for
  48 h, respectively. D Transcriptional activity of TEAD measured by luciferase assay
  with a reporter containing tandem TEAD-binding sites in AGS (left panel) or MKN28
  (right panel) cell line transfected with scrambled or two independent siRNA targeting
  OTUB1 for 48 h, respectively. E RT–qPCR results of OTUB1 mRNA expression in MKN28
  cell line stable expressing OTUB1-flag or lentiviral vector. F Western blot results
  showing the expression level of YAP and OTUB1 in MKN28 cell line stable expressing
  OTUB1-flag or lentiviral vector. G RT–qPCR results of CTGF and CYR61 mRNA expression
  in MKN28 cell line stable expressing OTUB1-flag or lentiviral vector. H Transcriptional
  activity of TEAD measured by luciferase assay with a reporter containing tandem
  TEAD-binding sites in MKN28 cell line stable expressing OTUB1-flag or lentiviral
  vector. I Immunohistochemistry (IHC) detecting OTUB1 and YAP expression in gastric
  cancer specimen. J Chi-square test to determine the correlation between OTUB1 and
  YAP. Data are normalized to the values of the control group and are presented as
  mean ± SEM. One-way ANOVA is conducted to detect significant differences in panel
  A, C, D. The t-test is conducted to detect significant differences in panel E, G,
  H (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).
