caption: 'Slc13a5 deficiency mouse model disease modules determined by CTD. CTD analysis
  identified the most perturbed metabolites in tissues from Slc13a5−/− mice as compared
  to wildtype mice for each tissue tested: serum (WT, n = 10; KO, n = 9), liver (WT,
  n = 10; KO, n = 10), or brain (WT, n = 10; KO, n = 9). Pathways within which perturbed
  metabolite falls are shown to provide a more meaningful analysis than simply listing
  individual metabolites. (A) CTD analysis represented in an enrichment of the super
  pathways for the key metabolites in the CTD network. Pathway enrichment of the CTD
  networks for the 71 CTD-identified metabolites identified in the brain (n = 26),
  serum (n = 28), and liver (n = 17) are illustrated in the major metabolic super
  pathways, highlighting the >50% lipid composition of these disease modules. (B)
  Sub-pathway enrichment of the CTD network of the most perturbed metabolites and
  pathways in Slc13a5 deficiency mice are shown for serum, brain, and liver (for tissue
  metabolite detail, see ). # = number or quantity of metabolites.'
