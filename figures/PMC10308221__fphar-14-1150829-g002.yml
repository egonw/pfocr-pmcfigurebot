caption: Effects of tetrandrine on the expression levels of IgA receptor protein in
  HBZY-1 cells. Cells were treated with different concentrations of TET (0, 1, 2.5
  and 3 μM) in the presence or absence of deS/deGal IgA for 48 h. The cell lysates
  were examined by Western blot. More than three independent experiments were carried
  out and representative results were shown in the figures. β-actin was used as internal
  control. Statistical analyses were performed using Bonferroni’s multiple comparison
  tests, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 and ****p < 0.0001 respectively. (n = 6).
article_title: Tetrandrine inhibits the proliferation of mesangial cells induced by
  enzymatically deglycosylated human IgA1 via IgA receptor/MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway.
