caption: (A) Correlation plot of potential resistance mechanisms identified in each
  patient demonstrating similar frequencies of alterations in MET, ERBB2, RAF (RAF1/BRAF),
  RAS (KRAS/NRAS), and PI3K (PIK3CA/B/G/PIK3R1) pathway genes. Coalteration of ERBB2
  and RAS was common, whereas coalteration of RAS and MET was uncommon. (B) Kaplan-Meier
  analysis stratifying PFS MET amplification status as detected by ctDNA or tissue-NGS.
  ctDNA, circulating tumor DNA; mPFS, median progression-free survival; NGS, next-generation
  sequencing; PFS, progression‐free survival; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase;
  WT, wild type.
