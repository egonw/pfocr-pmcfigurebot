figure_title: Hesperetin’s effect on the MAPK signaling pathway in H2O2-treated SH-SY5Y
  cells
caption: p-ERK, p-JNK, and p-p38 expression levels were measured using (A) immunoblotting,
  and (B-D) densities were normalized to β-actin using ImageJ software. (B) p-ERK,
  (C) p-JNK, and (D) p-p38 levels. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and results
  are presented as the mean ± SD. Different letters indicate significant differences
  (P < 0.05) as determined by Duncan’s multiple range test.MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; H2O2, hydrogen peroxide; p-, phosphorylated; ERK, extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; p38, p38 mitogen-activated
  protein kinases.
