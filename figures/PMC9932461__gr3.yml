caption: 'Analysis of sphingolipid metabolic protein activity. A: Ceramide metabolic
  pathway. Lipids (black) and genes (grey) were described. B: 13C3,15N-serine (4 mM)
  was incubated for 60 min at 37°C with 20 μM C16:0-CoA in the homogenates of murine
  ear. NADPH (1 mM) and pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP; 500 μM) were used as cofactors.
  13C2,15N-d18:0 was detected via LC-MS/MS. n = 3. C, D: d7-Sph d18:1 or d7-DHS d18:0
  was incubated with C24:0-CoA. The products were quantified via LC-MS/MS. NADH (1 mM)
  was used as a cofactor. n = 3. D: Cer[NS] d7-d18:1/24:0 was also measured as an
  indicator of ceramide desaturation via incubation with d7-DHS d18:0 and C24:0-CoA.
  E: Product ratio of (d7-d18:0/24:0)/(d7-d18:1/24:0) via incubation with d7-DHS d18:0
  and 24:0-CoA in ear homogenates. n = 3. F: mRNA expression levels in the epidermis
  of 4-week-old WT and Spade mice. Sphingolipid metabolic genes in the epidermis were
  analyzed via qPCR. Levels of gene expressions were normalized by levels of Gapdh.
  Data were expressed relative to the average level of each gene in WT epidermis.
  n = 4. G: Western blotting analysis of ear lysates revealed Delta 4-desaturase,
  sphingolipid (Degs1) and Actin expression levels. Bands were quantified using the
  Image-J software. mean + SE, student’s t-test, ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01. Cer[NS], ceramides
