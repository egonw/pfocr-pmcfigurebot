caption: IGFBP1 is upregulated in tumor cells during confined migration. A) Schematic
  model for sample preparation of confined cells for RNA sequencing analysis. Transwell
  migration assay was performed in A549 lung cancer cells with a chamber of 8 µm pore
  size. The migrating cells were split into two groups. In control group, the cells
  did not through the pores of transwell inserts. In confined group, the cells were
  constrained in the pores. RNA‐sequencing (RNA‐Seq) analysis was performed in these
  two groups of the cells. B) Volcano plot shows upregulated genes (Fold change >
  1, p < 0.05, FPKM > 10) in the confined cells. Highly upregulated genes (Fold change
  > 1.5, p < 0.05, FPKM > 10) were highlighted in red. C) A Venn diagram was used
  to visually represent overlapped 13 genes between upregulated genes in confined
  cells and genes of cellular response to stress pathway in Reactome database (top
  panel). Overlapped 13 genes were displayed in a heatmap. D) IGFBP1 expression was
  examined in A549 or SK‐Hep1 cells with or without confinement by using immunoblotting
  analyses. Brefeldin A (5 µm), inhibitor of protein secretion. E) A549 or SK‐Hep1
  cells were cultured in Transwell chambers with 0.4 or 8 µm pore size. Culture media
  of the cells were collected for the examination of secreted IGFBP1 by ELISA assay.
  In the chambers of 0.4 µm pore size, the cells could not migrate through the pores
  and served as the control cells for confined cells. Data represent the mean ± S.D.
  of three independent experiments. F) Left is a model of compression system. Right
  is IGFBP1 protein levels in A549 or SK‐Hep1 cells with or without mechanical compression
  (5 kPa) were examined by immunoblotting analyses. G) The mRNA levels of PIEZO1 and
  IGFBP1 in A549 and SK‐Hep1 cells with or without PIEZO1 depletion in the absence
  or presence of confinement were detected by quantitative PCR analysis. H) The protein
  levels of IGFBP1 in SK‐Hep1 cells with or without PIEZO1 depletion in the absence
  or presence of confinement were detected by immunoblotting analyses. Immunoblots
  are representative of three independent experiments.
