caption: Pan-cancer expression and cross-talk profiles of cuproptosis gene set. A.
  Expression difference between cancer and non-cancer tissues from TCGA. B. Expression
  differences between subtypes of cancers. C. Survival difference between high and
  low expression groups. D. Pie chart of the percentage of the effect of cuproptosis
  gene cross-talk with other cancer pathway activity. E. Heat map of the percentage
  of the effect of cuproptosis genes on other cancer pathway activity. F. Pathway
  regulation network of cuproptosis genes. A line represents a connection between
  genes and different pathways, where a solid line represents activation, and a dashed
  line represents inhibition. The color of the line represents different cancer types.
  G. The microRNA (miRNA) network of cuproptosis genes. A miRNA and one regulator
  connection node represent miRNA regulation of a gene. Node size is positively correlated
  with the nodeâ€™s degree, and edge width is defined by the absolute value of the correlation
  coefficient.
