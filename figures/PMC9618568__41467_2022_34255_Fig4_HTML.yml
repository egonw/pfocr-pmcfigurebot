figure_title: Ligand-receptor analysis identified proinflammatory, profibrotic signaling
  network
caption: a Dot plot showing gene expression of TNF (upper), IL6 (middle), or TGFB2
  (lower) in each cell type in ADPKD or control kidneys. The diameter of the dot corresponds
  to the proportion of cells expressing the indicated gene and the intensity of the
  dot corresponds to average expression relative to all cell types. b Ligand-receptor
  analysis with CellChat. Circle plot showing an inferred network (left) or heatmap (right)
  showing communication probabilities from senders (secretors) to receivers (targets)
  for TNF signaling pathway (upper), IL6 signaling pathway (middle), or TGFβ signaling
  pathway (lower). Thickness of an arrow in a circle plot indicates interaction strength.
