caption: 'Strategies for the improvement of retinal production via protein engineering
  of BCO by directed evolution (A), structure-based mutagenesis (B), d novo design
  of BCOs (C), optimization of metabolic pathway (MVA pathway, left; MEP pathway,
  right) for retinal production (top) through substrate channeling system (D), and
  co-factor regeneration system to increase the co-factor levels (E). Abbreviation
