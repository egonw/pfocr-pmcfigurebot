figure_title: Identification of cell clusters in ZIKV-infected testes
caption: Testes from PBS-injected (control) or ZIKV-infected A6 male mice at 14 dpi
  were subjected to single-cell sequencing analysis. a The distribution of cell clusters
  in the testes from control and ZIKV-infected mice was shown in tSNE chart. b The
  proportion of each cell cluster in all cells in the testes from control and ZIKV-infected
  mice was shown in pie chart. c The expression of ZIKV RNA in all cell clusters was
  shown in violin plot. d Intercellular communication in testes was analysis by using
  CellChat. The relative importance of each cell cluster based on the computed network
  centrality measures of outgoing/incoming signaling network was shown in heatmap.
  The relative contribution of each cluster or pathway was shown in corresponding
  column chart.
