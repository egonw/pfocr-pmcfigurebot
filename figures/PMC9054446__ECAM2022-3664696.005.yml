caption: 'ALR and PALR mediate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in HMCs. (a-b)
  Representative p-AKT and p-mTOR results observed using a light microscope (400 × magnification)
  (scale bar = 20 μm). (c-d) The quantification results of p-AKT positive cells and
  p-mTOR positive cells (%). Data were expressed as mean ± SD (n = 3; ##P < 0.01 versus
  control group, ∗∗P < 0.01 versus LPS group). (e-f) The protein expressions of p-AKT
  and p-mTOR were analyzed using Western blot. Data were expressed as mean ± SD (n = 3;
  #P < 0.05 or ##P < 0.01 versus control group, ∗P < 0.05 or ∗∗P < 0.01 versus LPS
  group).'
