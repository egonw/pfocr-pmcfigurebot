figure_title: Dapa attenuates MAPK/AP1 cascades and cardiac inflammation in HFD mice
caption: 'Mice were randomly divided into 3 groups, including LFD, HFD and HFD + Dapa.
  After 3 months of high fat diet, mice were treated with 1 mg·kg−1·d−1 Dapa for another
  2 months. a Western blot analysis of proteins in MAPK pathway in heart tissue. GAPDH
  was used as loading control. b Representative images of anti-p-cJUN immunofluorescence
  staining in heart sections (scale bar = 25 μm). c Quantitative analysis of inflammatory
  genes in heart tissue, and β-actin was used as normalization control. d ELISA assay
  of inflammatory cytokines in heart tissues. e, f Representative images of anti-TNF-α
  and anti-CD68 immunochemistry staining in heart sections (scale bar = 30 μm). n = 8;
  Means ± SEM; One-way ANOVA followed by Turkey post-hoc tests; *P < 0.05, compared
  with LFD group, #P < 0.05, compared with HFD group.'
