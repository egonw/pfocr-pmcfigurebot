caption: Mechanistic model of AtENO2 affecting seed germination under salt stress
  Under salt stress, AtENO2 gene mutation up-regulated genes and proteins related
  to the ABA signaling pathway. The mutant also down-regulated genes and proteins
  related to stress, GA, and ROS scavenging, ultimately affecting seed germination
  rate.

  the mechanism by which AtENO2 affects seed germination under salt stress.
