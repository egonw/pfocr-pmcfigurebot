caption: (A) The regulation network among GR24 and Tis108 with endogenous hormones
  during longan somatic embryo development. (B) The regulatory network composed of
  DlSMXL6 during longan somatic embryo development. The arrow indicates promoting
  the process. The “T” line indicates inhibiting the process.
