figure_title: Comparison of EpiLSCs with other formative PSCs
caption: (A) UMAP embedding of EpiLSCs with FTW cells, FS cells, and fPSCs.(B) Aligning
  formative PSCs in (A) to the E4.5–6.5 epiblasts by scSTALT.(C) Cumulative population
  doubling of FTW cells and EpiLSCs during adaptation in 2i+LIF medium.(D) Morphology
  of FTW-ESCs and EpiLSCs during their adaptation in 2i+LIF medium shown by phase
  contrast (scale bar, 200 μm) and AP staining (scale bar, 100 μm) images. Arrowheads
  indicate differentiated colonies.(E) Heatmap showing the expressions of the selected
  consecutively downregulated genes (FTW cells > EpiLSCs > FS cells) and upregulated
  genes (FTW cells < EpiLSCs < FS cells).(F) Metabolic pathway transcriptional activity
  inferred by scMetabolism shown in the same UMAP as in (A) (left) and in bar plot
  (right).(G) Heatmap showing the gene expressions of canonical and non-canonical
  TCA cycle genes in FTW cells, EpiLSCs, FS cells, and fPSCs.(H) ATAC-seq openness
  of FTW cells, EpiLSCs, day 2 EpiLCs, and FS cells in PRC2 insulators showing by
  metagene profile plot (top) and heatmap (bottom). S and E stand for the starting
  and ending sites of the insulator region, respectively. 5 kb flanking regions were
  included.See also  and .
