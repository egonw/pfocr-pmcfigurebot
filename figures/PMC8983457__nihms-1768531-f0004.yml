  ERK2
caption: A, The protein level of mutant p53 and p53 targets in HT29 cells following
  treatment with NSC59984 (μmol/L) in combination with NAC (10 mmol/L) or BSO (10
  μmol/L) for 16 hours. B, p53-responsive reporter bioluminescence in SW480 cells
  treated with NSC59984 (μmol/L) and NAC (10 mmol/L) for 16 hours. C, p53 responsive
  reporter bioluminescence in SW480 cells treated with NSC59984 (μmol/L) and BSO (10
  μmol/L) for 16 hours. D, The expression of mutant p53 and p53 targets at the protein
  level in SW480 cells treated with NSC59984 (μmol/L) and U0126 (10 μmol/L) for 16
  hours. E, The protein level of mutant p53 and p53 targets in RXF393 cancer cells
  carrying mutant p53 (R175H). The cells were treated with NSC59984 (μmol/L) and U0126
  (10 μmol/L) or BSO (20 μmol/L) for 16 hours. F, The expression of mutant p53 and
  p53 targets at the protein levels in HT29 cells treated with NSC59984 (μmol/L) and
  ERK1/2 inhibitor SCH772984 (1μmol/L) or VX-11e (5μmol/L) for 16 hours. G, The p53-responsive
  reporter bioluminescence assay in SW480 cells with the overexpression of Ad-p73.
  p73 was overexpressed in SW480 cells by adenovirus (Ad-p73) infection. The cells
  were treated with NSC59984 (μmol/L) and U0126 (10μmol/L) or SP600125 (10μmol/L)
  for 16 hours. Data represent mean ± SD. *, P<0.05 compared with the NSC59984 treatment
  at each dosage. H, The Ad-p73 expressed protein levels in the cells with the adenovirus
  infection(G). I, ChIP-PCR assay. p73 was overexpressed in HT29 with adenovirus infection.
  Following treatment with NSC59984 (μmol/L) and U0126 (μmol/L) for 7 hours. ChIP
  assay was performed with anti-P73 and IgG as a control. The p21 or Noxa promoters
  were quantified by real-time PCR using the ChIP-eluted DNA. Data were normalized
  to the ChIP with anti-p73 in the cells treated with DMSO treatment as a control.
  Data represent mean ± SD, N=2. ANOVA test, P<0.05. J. P21 and Noxa at the protein
  level in HT29 cells by Western blot assay (I).
