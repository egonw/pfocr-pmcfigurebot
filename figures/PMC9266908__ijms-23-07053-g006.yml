caption: Effect of hydroxytyrosol (HT) on the expression levels of different marker
  proteins for cell proliferation and differentiation (c-Myc, KSR1), apoptosis (Bcl-2,
  p53, Caspase 9) and cellular oxidative stress (SOD) in Jurkat and HL60 cell lines
  controls and exposed to the IC50 concentration of HT for 24 h in Jurkat cells and
  72 h in HL60 cells. Quantification of protein levels by densitometric analysis is
  shown in bar graphs. Results are means Â± SEM (n = 9) and are expressed as percentage
  of expression compared to actin levels in Western-blot analysis. The presence of
  the asterisk indicates significant differences between the control and treated cells
  (* p < 0.01; ** p < 0.001). KSR1, Kinase suppressor of Ras 1; Bcl2, Anti-apoptotic
  B-cell lymphoma 2; SOD, Superoxide dismutase.
