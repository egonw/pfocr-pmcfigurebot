caption: Effects of TP on the Nrf2 signal pathway both in vivo and in vitro. (a) Comparison
  of Nrf2 mRNA expression in primary hepatocytes (HCs) and Kupffer cells (KCs) (n
  = 5). (b) Changes on the viability of Raw264.7 cells administrated with different
  concentrations of TP for 24 hours (n = 6). (c) Effect of TP on the transportation
  of Nrf2 to the nucleus in Raw264.7 cells (n = 3). (d) Changes of Nrf2 and NQO1 in
  the liver of mice after TP treatment for 14 days (n ≥ 5). (e) Changes in the serum
  ALT and AST in female and male mice administrated with TP for 14 days (n = 6). (f)
  Representative images of HE-stained livers from female and male mice; inflammatory
  infiltration (black arrows), 200x magnification. Data are presented as mean ± SEM,
  ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. control.
