caption: 'Dehydrocorydaline (DHC) ameliorated cell proliferative capacity of the TNFα-treated
  human chondrocytes. (A) 50% inhibiting concentration (IC50) of DHC on the normal
  human chondrocytes after culture for 48 h. (B) Effects of 10 and 20 μM DHC on cell
  activities of normal human chondrocytes after culture for 1, 2, 3, and 4 days. (C)
  EdU-positive cells in the normal, TNFα, TNFα + 10 μM DHC, and TNFα + 20 μM DHC groups
  and (D) the quantitative results after treatment for 48 h. (E) Cell proliferation
  of the human chondrocytes in the normal, TNFα, TNFα + 10 μM DHC, and TNFα + 20 μM
  DHC groups detected by flow cytometry analysis and (F) the quantitative results
  after treatment for 48 h. Scar bar = 100 μm. Data are presented as mean ± SD. *,
  p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001 compared to the control group (the TNFα group).
  #, p < 0.05; ##, p < 0.01 compared to the normal group at the same time point.'
