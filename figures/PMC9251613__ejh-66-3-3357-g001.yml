caption: HMGB1 regulates the production of MMP13, ADAMTS5, IL-1β and IL-6 from TMJOA
  synovial fibroblasts. A,C,E,G) A dose-dependent augmentation of MMP13, ADAMTS5,
  IL-1β and IL-6 in synovial fibroblasts was induced by HMGB1 for 24 h. B,D,F,H) A
  time-dependent increase of MMP13, ADAMTS5, IL-1β and IL-6 in these cells was induced
  by 100 ng/mL of HMGB1. Western blotting assays were used to assay the relative expression
  levels; β-actin served as control; data are shown as the means with 95% CI and are
  analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test, n=6, *p< 0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001.
