caption: Illustration of the effect of hyperinsulinemia on insulin receptors and stimulation
  of steroidogenesis caused by hyperinsulinemia and increased LH (luteinizing hormone)
  levels. Insulin receptor defects are due to serine phosphorylation of the insulin
  receptor and IRS-1 (insulin receptor substrate 1) secondary to intracellular serine
  kinases. This results in reduced PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) downstream activity
  after insulin mediated activation and resistance to the metabolic actions of insulin.
  Activation of kinases in ERK/MAPK (extracellular signal-regulated kinases/mitogen-activated
  protein kinases) mitogenic pathway in PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) causes
  inhibitory serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in skeletal muscle in patients with PCOS
  as demonstrated here. These defects in the insulin receptor gene exist in patients
  with PCOS with extreme insulin resistance although insulin receptor numbers and
  affinity are similar to those in the patient without insulin receptor defects. Steroidogenesis
  is stimulated by both hyperinsulinemia causing inositolglycan generation and increased
  basal LH secreted from the anterior pituitary in response, also demonstrated below.
