caption: SQLE increases tumor cell migration and invasion by regulating the PTEN/AKT/GSK3β
  signaling pathway through P53. (A–C) The wound-healing assay demonstrated the capacity
  of migration in two BCa cells T24 and 5637; (D, E) The migration of T24 and 5637
  cells were rescued by upregulation of P53 as measured by a transwell assay; Data
  represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
