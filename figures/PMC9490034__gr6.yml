caption: The expression and survival analysis of eRNA-mediated immune checkpoint score(A–C)
  The immune checkpoints score of three types of gene sets, including major histocompatibility
  complex (MHC), immune co-inhibitory checkpoints (IAP), and immune co-stimulator
  checkpoints (ICP), were all significant differences in the three eRNA subtypes (p < 0.05).(D)
  The correlation of BTLA and ENSR00000305509 (p < 0.05).(E) The correlation of TMIGD2
  and ENSR00000106294 (p < 0.05).(F) K-M analysis of the high versus low TMIGD2 expression
  group in the TCGA GC cohort. (p = 0.0054).(G) K-M analysis of the high versus low
  BTLA expression group in the TCGA GC cohort. (p = 0.2).(H) ENSR00000305509 corresponding
  mutation driver genes (SYNE1, APC, TP53) (p<0.05).(I) ENSR00000106294 corresponding
  mutation driver genes (SYNE1, GPR98, TP53, TNN) (p<0.05).(J) The correlation of
  ENSR00000106294 and immunotherapy-related pathway (left). The correlation of ENSR00000305509
  and immunotherapy-related pathway (right).
