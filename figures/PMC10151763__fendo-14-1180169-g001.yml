caption: Klotho structure and its mechanism of action. Klotho consists of two extracellular
  structural domains (KL1 and KL2), a transmembrane segment (TM), and a short non-signaling
  cytoplasmic tail (CYT). Enzymes such as ADAM10 or ADAM17 can cleave Klotho to produce
  a soluble form called s-Klotho. FGF23 binds to the Klotho/FGFR1c receptor in the
  renal tubule to form the Klotho/FGFR/FGF23 signaling complex, which exerts multiple
  actions. Klotho binds to the TGF-β receptor, specifically the TβRII component, and
  inhibits TGF-β and its downstream pathways and molecular activation. Klotho inhibits
  the activation of the inflammatory NF-κB pathway and increases signaling in the
  Nrf2 pathway. Klotho block IGF-1 receptor signaling as well as the expression of
  target genes downstream of Wnt/β-catenin. Klotho inhibits inflammation and fibrosis
  in diabetic nephropathy through multiple pathways. KL, Klotho; FGF23, fibroblast
