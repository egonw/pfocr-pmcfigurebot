caption: TLR4 surface expression and function is supported by the IRE1/XBP1 pathway.
  TNF and IL-6 levels in the supernatants in response to LPS stimulation (1 μg/mL,
  4 h) were measured by ELISA for an equal number of YFP-sorted XBP1 KO and DKO PMCs,
  as compared to WT PMCs. The average of three independent experiments ± SD is shown
  for (A) IL-6 and (B) TNF. * p < 0.05. (C) Flow cytometry analysis of TLR4 cell surface
  expression of XBP1 KO (green histogram) and DKO PMCs (red histogram), as compared
  to WT PMCs (blue histogram). (D) Quantification of TLR4 expression levels in WT,
  XBP1 KO, and DKO PMCs. Data are presented as the average ± SD of the mean fluorescence
  intensity minus the background (ΔMFI) of three independent analyses. * p < 0.05.
  (E) Flow cytometry analysis of TLR2 expression in WT, XBP1 KO, and DKO PMCs (blue,
  green, and red histograms, respectively). (F) RT-qPCR analysis of sXBP1 in PMCs
  treated with DMSO or 60 μM STF, 1 h prior to stimulation with LPS (1 μg/mL) for
  3, 6, and 12 h. Bars are represented as the mean of the relative mRNA levels normalized
  to GAPDH ± SD of three independent experiments. Cytokines levels in the supernatants
  for (G) IL-6 and (H) TNF were determined by ELISA. Each bar represents the mean
  ± SD of three independent experiments. * p < 0.05.
