caption: Effects of P and Zn supply on the production and distribution of auxin in
  maize. Inbred line B73 were grown in a hydroponic solution containing different
  combinations of P and Zn for 7 days. A Effects of P and Zn supply on free indole-3-acetic
  acid in lateral roots emerging from the primary root. Values are means ± SD (n = 4).
  Means with the same letter are not significantly different at P < 0.05 according
  to the LSD test. B Effects of P and Zn supply on fluorescence of ZmDR5::mRFP reporter
  maize. Scale bars = 100 μm. C The distribution of cytosolic Zn in roots of ZmDR5::RFP
  reporter maize. Cytosolic Zn was visualized by the membrane-permeant fluorescent
  sensor Zinpyr-1. Scale bars = 100 μm
