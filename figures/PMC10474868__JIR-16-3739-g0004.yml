caption: 'Influence of fullerenol nanofilm on toxicity and the levels of growth factors
  secreted by cells. (A) Metabolic activity of cells after 24 h incubation on fullerenol
  nanofilm determined with the XTT assay. There were significant differences between
  viability of SNU-449 control cells and cells grown on nanofilm C60(OH)40 (p = 0.011).
  Differences with a p-value ≤ 0.05 were defined as statistically significant compared
  to the control group: one asterisk (*), p-value ≤ 0.05. (B) The growth factor profile
  in culture media of cells growth on ordinary polystyrene plates and plates coated
  with C60(OH)40 nanofilm. Different colors indicate differences in protein expression
  with expression increasing from black to white according to scale above the photo.
  Negative controls and blanks are marked with blue and green circles and were used
  for background removal. The background was removed with Protein Array Analyzer for
  ImageJ software. (C) The table shows the location of individual growth factors on
  the protein membrane. The positive control (pos) was biotin-conjugated IgG. Cytokine
  expression was evaluated using densitometry software for a semi-quantitative comparison.'
