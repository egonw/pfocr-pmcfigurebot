caption: (a) Resistance and (b) Capacitance evolution curves derived from . (a) The
  frequency response of resistance in the middle to low range (1 kHz < f < 10 kHz)
  is sensitive to the electrical pathway between cells and the channel surface. This
  evolution demonstrates the creation of cellâ€“cell binding. (b) The capacitance at
  high frequency current (f > 10 kHz) is sensitive to the current passing through
  the cell body and quantifies confluence.
