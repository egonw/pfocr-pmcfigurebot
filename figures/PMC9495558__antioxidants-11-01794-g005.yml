caption: Effects of DHPA on the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in Aβ(1–42)/Cu2+/AA-induced
  SH-SY5Y cells. (A) Representative Western blot were shown for Bax, Bcl-2, and Cleaved
  Caspase-3 proteins. Bax/Bcl-2 (B), cleaved caspase-3 (D), and protein expressions
  were detected by Western blot analysis. MMP (C) of SH-SY5Y cells treated with the
  Aβ(1–42)/Cu2+/AA mixture in the absence or presence of different concentrations
  of DHPA. * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 compared to the control group.
