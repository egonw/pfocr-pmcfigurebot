caption: Attenuation of glycogen synthesis and enhancement of glycogen degradation.
  a Overview illustration of the metabolic pathways involved in the two precursors
  in the synthesis of acarbose. The red arrow down represents the weakened glycogen
  synthesis pathway, and the green arrow up represents the enhanced glycogen degradation
  pathway. b Determination of glycogen content in SIPI12-34 and ΔGS/glgP during the
  fermentation process. c Acarbose production profiles of SIPI12-34 and ΔGS/glgP were
  analyzed by HPLC. Error bars show standard deviations, ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01
article_title: Enhancement of acarbose production by genetic engineering and fed-batch
  fermentation strategy in Actinoplanes sp. SIPI12-34.
