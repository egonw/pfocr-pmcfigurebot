figure_title: RanGAP1 facilitates CRC tumorigenesis via the MAPK signaling pathway
caption: A The volcano plot of differential mRNA expression in RanGAP1 silenced DLD1
  and control group ( | log2(fold change) |>1 and p value < 0.05). B KEGG enrichment
  analysis of different genes in RanGAP1 knockdown cells and control cells. C, D Expression
  levels of proteins associated with the MAPK signaling pathway were evaluated in
  CRC cells transfected stably with the shRanGAP1, shNC+Control, shMETTL3+Control,
  shMETTL3+RanGAP1, shYTHDF1+Control and shYTHDF1 + RanGAP1.
article_title: METTL3-mediated RanGAP1 promotes colorectal cancer progression through
  the MAPK pathway by recruiting YTHDF1.
