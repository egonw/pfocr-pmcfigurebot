caption: Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis of sulfur metabolism in deep-sea
  Chloroflexota bacteria. (A) Typical pathway of assimilatory sulfate reduction existing
  in bacteria. (B) Typical pathway of dissimilatory sulfate reduction existing in
  bacteria. (C) Distribution of genes encoding key enzymes involved in assimilatory
  and dissimilatory sulfate reduction in deep-sea Chloroflexota MAGs and strain ZRK33.
  The presence of enzymes involved in the sulfur metabolic pathway is indicated by
  using red-colored rectangles. Sat, sulfate adenylyltransferase; CysN, sulfate adenylyltransferase
  subunit 1; CysD, sulfate adenylyltransferase subunit 2; CysC, adenylyl-sulfate kinase;
  CysH, phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate reductase; Sir, sulfite reductase; AsrA, AsrB,
  and AsrC, anaerobic sulfite reductases; CysI, sulfite reductase (NADPH) hemoprotein
  beta-component; TST, thiosulfate sulfurtransferase; AprA and AprB, adenylylsulfate
  reductase; DsrA and DsrB, dissimilatory sulfite reductase; DsrC, protein substrate
  of dissimilatory sulfite reductase; DsrMKJOP, sulfite reduction-associated complex.
  (D) In situ metatranscriptomics-based heat map showing upregulated genes encoding
  proteins associated with sulfur metabolism in deep-sea Chloroflexota bacteria. The
  numbers in panel (D) represent the fold change of gene expression (using log2 values).
  TPK, sediment from the center of cold seep; TPKF, sediment far away from the center
  of cold seep.
