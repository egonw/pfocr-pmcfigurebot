caption: 'RNA-seq analysis of the differential expressional genes enriched in aging.
  (A,B) Hierarchical heatmap analysis [(A), n = 3 per group] and pie graph of the
  up-and down-regulated genes composition (B) of the differentially expressed genes
  (DEGs) as determined by the selection criteria: | FC| > 1.5 and p < 0.01. (C) Top
  30 GO terms enriched by the MetaScape tool. The diameter of the solid circle denotes
  the number of DEGs enriched and the color showing the p-value in the corresponding
  pathway. (Dâ€“H) Gene cluster enriched in gliogenesis, glia cell proliferation, and
  microglia activation (D); positive regulation of cell death, hippocampus neuron
  death, and synapse pruning (E); phagocytosis (F); positive regulation of cytosolic
  calcium ion concentration (G); and regulation of endopeptidase activity and positive
  regulation of hydrolase activity (H). (I) qRT-PCR analysis of selected genes related
  to microglial activation and neuroinflammation. Data are calculated as the mRNA
  foldchange of the young group and represent the means Â± SEM. Unpaired Studentâ€™s
  t-test, n = 3â€“6 per group *p < 0.05. (J) The Hub genes clustering by the protein-protein
  interaction network as determined by the MCODE tool of MetaScape.'
