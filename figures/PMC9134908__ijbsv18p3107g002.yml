caption: Lipogenesis pathway is activated by overexpression of 11β-HSD1. (A) Western
  blot detection of proteins related to the lipid biosynthesis, oxidation, secretion,
  uptake, and hydrolysis pathways in 11β-HSD1 overexpressed or GFP overexpressed Hep1-6
  cells exposed or not to 0.25 μM BVT2733 and (B) relative protein levels (n = 3).
  (C) Oil red O staining of Hep1-6 cells and treatments from (A). (D) Measurement
  of triglyceride levels in Hep1-6 cells and treatments from (A) (n = 3). (E) Western
  blot showing the expression levels of lipogenesis pathway regulatory proteins in
  Hep1-6 cells and treatments from (A), and (F) relative protein levels (n = 3). *P<0.05,
  **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.
