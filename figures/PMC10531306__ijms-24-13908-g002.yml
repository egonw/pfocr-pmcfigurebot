caption: GHR signaling pathways. JAK2 activation by GH initiates certain signaling
  pathways. SHC is phosphorylated by JAK2, which activates MAPK. JAK2 phosphorylates
  the transcription factor STAT as well. PI 3′-kinase activation via the phosphorylation
  of IRS proteins by JAK2 may be crucial for glucose metabolism. The GHR also activates
  the Src family kinase signaling pathway, which in turn activates JNK and ERK1/2,
  and regulates gene transcription (created using https://www.biorender.com) (accessed
