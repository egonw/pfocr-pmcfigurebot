figure_title: HH pathway component expressions in fungiform and filiform papillae
caption: X-Gal staining of FP (A-E) and FILIF (A’-E’) papillae in sagittal sections
  from a lacZ negative Control mouse and Gli1lacZ/+, Gli2lacZ/+, Ptch1lacZ/+ and HhiplacZ/+
  reporter mice. (A,A’) There is no X-Gal staining in Control tissue. Scale bars apply
  to all corresponding images from reporter mice. (B) Gli1lacZ cells are observed
  in basal epithelial cells of the FP walls, in perigemmal and in stromal cells. (B’)
  No Gli1 expression is detected in FILIF. (C,C’) Gli2lacZ is expressed throughout
  the entire basal epithelial and stromal cells of FP and FILIF. (D,D’) Ptch1lacZ
  is expressed in FP basal epithelial cells, perigemmal and stromal cells, and in
  a subset of FILIF cells. (E,E’) Expression of HhiplacZ is observed only in FILIF,
  in a subset of cells. There is no HhiplacZ expression in FP cells. Black dotted
  lines outline the base of the epithelium.
