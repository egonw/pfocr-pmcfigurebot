caption: SNHG22 accelerates trophoblast migration and invasion via regulating miR-128-3p.
  HTR-8/Svneo and JEG-3 were transfected with inhibitor-NC, miR-128-3p inhibitor with
  or without sh-SNHG22, or mimics-NC, miR-128-3p mimics with or without pcDNA-SNHG22.After
  transfection for 24h, the cells were collected and performed further experiments.
  (A and B) miR-128-3p expression in HTR-8/Svneo and JEG-3 cells was examined by q-PCR.
  Wound healing (C and D) and Transwell assays (E and F) demonstrated the migration
  and invasion of HTR-8/Svneo and JEG-3 cells. Experiments were replicated three times.
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001. Data are expressed as mean±SD.
