caption: RNA sequencing differential expression analysis between BMDMs from Control
  (Ctrl) and Tm6sf2 mKO (mKO) mice. (A) Heatmap representation depicting the significantly
  changed genes in BMDMs after oxLDL treatment (Tm6sf2 mKO compared with the control,
  padj < 0.05). (B) Visualizations of GO enrichment of the significantly changed genes
  by metascape. Here are the top 20 significant signaling pathways. (C–E) Details
  of selected signaling pathway enrichment plot demonstrated by GSEA analysis, which
  shows the specific gene distribution and correlation with control and mKO BMDMs.
  (F) Heat map representation depicting the expression of genes associated with inflammatory,
  ER stress, and cholesterol transport in BMDMs upon oxLDL stimulation (Tm6sf2 mKO
  compared with the control. p ≤ 0.01 and log2-fold change ≥0.5, the color bar indicates
  z-score in heatmap).
