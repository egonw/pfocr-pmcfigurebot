caption: 'Potential mechanism of AuNP-induced toxicity. (i) Necrosis: direct physical
  damage to the cellular membrane, (ii) apoptosis: oxidative stress-triggered intrinsic
  mitochondrial-mediated pathway, (iii) inhibition of cell motility: interference
  of actin filament formation and stimulation of lamin A/C overexpression inducing
  increased nuclear stiffness, (iv) ROS generation: indirectly induced by AuNPs mainly
  through lysosomal membrane permeabilization, mitochondrial depolarization, and interaction
  with redox-active enzymes, (v) genotoxicity: primary damage induced by AuNPs including
  direct interaction with DNA leading to inhibition of DNA replication and indirect
  DNA cleavage and mutation via oxidative stress, and (vi) inflammation: induction
  of inflammatory response due to direct and indirect inflammasome activation by AuNPs'
article_title: Systematic and mechanistic analysis of AuNP-induced nanotoxicity for
  risk assessment of nanomedicine.
