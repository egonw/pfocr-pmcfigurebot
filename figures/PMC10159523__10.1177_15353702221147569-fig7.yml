caption: VCP979 suppress the expression of p-p38/p38 MAPK, TGF-β1 and inhibited downstream
  Smad-dependent signaling pathway in UUO rats. (a) Western blot of the protein expression
  level of p-p38 MAPK, p38 MAPK, TGF-β1, p-Smad2, Smad2, p-Smad3, and Smad3 (n = 8
  per group). (b) Measured ratio of p-p38 MAPK to p38 MAPK protein expression of the
  three groups. (c) Measured protein expression of TGF-β1 in the three groups. (d)
  Measured ratio of p-Smad2/Smad2 and p-Smad3/Smad3 protein expression of the three
  groups. All data were shown as mean ± SD.*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01.
