caption: 'Validation of significant differentially expressed genes and proteins in
  glycine, serine and threonine metabolism signaling pathway in chick livers between
  3 groups. (A) Heat maps of 8 significantly differentially expressed genes. (B) The
  mRNA expression levels of DMGDH, DMGDHL1, GATM, AGXT2, SHMT1, PSAT1, ALAS2, and
  GCLC by qPCR. (C) Heat maps of 8 significantly differentially expressed proteins.
  (D) The protein expression levels of DMGDH, ALAS2, GATM, SHMT1, PSAT1, and GCLC
  by PRM. Compared with the control group, * means P < 0.05, ** means P < 0.01. Compared
  with the FFC group, # means P < 0.05, ## means P < 0.01.'
