caption: MiR-125b regulates GCs proliferation and steroidogenesis and by targeting
  SCAP-SREBP axis. (A) The qRT-PCR validations and RNA-seq of SCAP in GCs from in
  different glucose treatment groups. (B) Pearsonâ€™s correlation was determined between
  SCAP and MiR-125b. (C) MiR-125b or pcDNA3.1-lncGSAR and MiR-125 mimics were co-transfected
  into GCs for CCK-8 assay. (D,E) The concentrations of E2 and P4 determination in
  GCs transfected with MiR-125b mimics, i.e., pcDNA3.1-lncSCAP and MiR-125 mimics.
  (F) CCK-8 assay of GCs at 48 h after transfection of MiR-125b mimics plasmid or
  pcDNA3.1-lncSREBP and MiR-125 mimics. (G,H) The concentrations of E2 and P4 determination
  in GCs transfected with MiR-125b mimics, i.e., pcDNA3.1-lncSREBP and MiR-125 mimics.
  (I,J) Western blot detection of SCAP (I) and SREBP (J) in GCs after overexpression
  of MiR-125b. (K) Schematic depicting the interaction of MiR-125b with wild-type
  (blue) and mutant SCAP (green). Red nucleotides indicate the seed sequence of MiR-125b.
  (L) The regulatory relationship between MiR-125b and SCAP was assessed using a dual-luciferase
  reporter gene assay. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01. N.S., not significant.
