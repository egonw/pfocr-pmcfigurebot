caption: Synergistic effects elicited by combined treatment trametinib and JQ1 in
  pancreatic cancer. (A) Effect of trametinib and/or JQ1 on the percentage of cells
  in relative trametinib-sensitive PDAC cell lines (AsPC-1 and PSN-1). Light gray
  bars show control values. ‘‘Multiplication’’ indicates the expected effect of combined
  treatment if single-agent effects were multiplied; the red arrow indicates the actual
  effect of the combination. (B) Effect of trametinib and/or JQ1 on the percentage
  of cells in relative trametinib-resistant PDAC cell lines (PANC-1 and CFPAC-1).
  (C–F) Combination index (CI) (top) and isobologram (bottom) analyses reveal the
  synergistic effect of trametinib and JQ1 not only in trametinib-sensitive PDAC cell
  lines (AsPC-1 and PSN-1), but also in trametinib-resistant PDAC cell lines (PANC-1
  and CFPAC-1). Fraction affected (Fa)-CI plots (top) and normalized isobolograms
  (bottom) are shown.
