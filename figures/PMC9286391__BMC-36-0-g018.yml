caption: 'The conjoint analysis results of the hepatoprotective effect mechanism of
  CASPG and UASPG based on metabonomics.  Note: the red mark represents the shared
  differential metabolic pathway among control group, model group, CASPG and UASPG.
  The green mark represents the shared differential metabolic pathway among control
  group, model group and CASPG. The black mark represents the screened differential
  metabolic pathway between the control and model groups. The purple mark represents
  the differential metabolic pathway between CASPG and the model group. The brown
  mark represents the differential metabolic pathway between UASPG and the model group.
  The blue mark represents the shared differential metabolic pathway among the model
  group, CASPG and UASPG'
