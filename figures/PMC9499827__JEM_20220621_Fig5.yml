caption: Immune response in SARS-CoV-2 infected aged mice is delayed, diminished,
  and dysregulated. (A–C) Groups of adult or aged (10-wk- or 40-wk-old) C57BL/6 mice
  (n = 3–5 per group) were infected with 300 PFU MA20. Lungs were harvested at the
  indicated time points, processed, and subjected to RNA-sequencing. (A) Principal
  component analysis plot of RNA-sequencing data obtained from total lungs of the
  indicated groups of mice. (B) GSEA comparing adult and aged mice at each time point
  after infection. Gene set preranked analyses were carried out using the C5 GO gene
  set collection in the Molecular Signatures Database. (C) Heat map for significant
  differences in canonical pathways as defined by IPA. Six pairwise comparisons between
  infected lung samples and their respective mock controls, from adult or aged animals,
  at the indicated days p.i., are shown (fold change >1.5, padj <0.05). The Benjamini–Hochberg
  method of multiple testing correction was used to calculate −log(P values). Up-
  and down-regulated transcripts across the different pairwise comparisons in the
  “Th1 and Th2 pathway” are shown as heat maps.
