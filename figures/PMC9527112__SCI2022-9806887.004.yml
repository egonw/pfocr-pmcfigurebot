caption: EPO rescued inflammation and apoptosis levels of PDLSCs under inflammatory
  microenvironment. (a) Cell viability of EPO treatment groups. (b) mRNA expression
  levels of IL-1β and IL-8 compared to β-actin through qPCR. (c, d) mRNA and protein
  expression levels of Bax/Bcl2 ratio compared to β-actin through qPCR and western
  blot. (e) Cell apoptosis rate of EPO treatment groups. Data are presented as mean
  ± SD (n = 3); ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001.
