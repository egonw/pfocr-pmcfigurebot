figure_title: Sulfide metabolite formation and fate
caption: 'a | Various chemical metabolite fate pathways for sulfide and its related
  species are shown. The basal level of production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is determined
  by the activity of three main enzymes: cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH), cystathionine
  β-synthase (CBS) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST). In addition, bacterial
  enzymes (such as sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), sulfite reductase [NADPH] flavoprotein
  α-component (CysJ) and anaerobic sulfite reductase subunit A (AsrA)) can reduce
  terminal sulfide oxidation end products (such as thiosulfate, sulfate and sulfite)
  back to H2S. H2S can undergo a myriad of reactions leading to the formation of small
  oxoacids of sulfur, sulfane sulfur species and acid-labile sulfur species. b | Various
  enzymatic and non-enzymatic biochemical pathways are involved in sulfide metabolite
  formation. Sulfide catabolism through the mitochondrial H2S oxidation pathway leads
  to the metabolic end products of sulfate and thiosulfate. CARS, cysteinyl–tRNA synthetase
  (also known as cytoplasmic cysteine–tRNA ligase); CAT, cysteine aminotransferase;
  CysSH, cysteine; CysSSH, cysteine hydropersulfide; ETHE1, persulfide dioxygenase;
  GSH, glutathione; GSSG, glutathione disulfide; MP, mercaptopyruvate; PPi, inorganic
  pyrophosphate; SQR, sulfide–quinone oxidoreductase; SQR-SSH, sulfide–quinone oxidoreductase
  hydropersulfide.'
