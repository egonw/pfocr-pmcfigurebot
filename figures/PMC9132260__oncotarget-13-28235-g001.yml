figure_title: HOXB9 expression in PDAC patients
caption: HOXB9 mRNA was highly expressed in approximately 46% of the patients (A).
  Increased HOXB9 expression was significantly associated with poor disease-free survival
  (p < 0.001) (B) and the prognosis for overall survival (p < 0.001) (C). Moreover,
  a significant positive correlation was observed between HOXB9 expression and several
  TGFβ signatures (D).
