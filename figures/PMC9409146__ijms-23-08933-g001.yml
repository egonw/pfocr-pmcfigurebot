caption: 'Cryptoproteins are widely detected in human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines:
  (A) A heatmap representation of cryptoprotein expression in lung adenocarcinoma
  cell lines with annotated driver mutation (KRAS, EGFR, KEAP1, TP53, LKB1, EML4/ALK)
  shows no association between mutational status and cryptoprotein production. (B)
  Cryptoproteins identified and quantified in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. (C)
  Ingenuity pathway analyses of genes corresponding to the 420 cryptoproteins detected
  in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines revealed enrichment of inflammatory pathways with
  B-cell receptor and immunoglobulin families as central network nodes.'
