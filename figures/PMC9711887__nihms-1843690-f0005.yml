caption: '(A and B) Notch signaling reporter expression (anti-V5 in red) in (A) wild
  type and (B) miR-956[KO] mutants counterstained for progenitors in HRP (green) and
  all cell nuclei (DAPI in blue). (A′–B′) Grayscale images of Notch signaling reporter
  in wild type versus miR-956[KO] mutants.(C) Fluorescence intensity of Notch reporter
  expression in EBs in wild type versus miR-956[KO] mutants.(D and E) Midguts from
  (D) control or (E) miR-956[KO] mutants stained for smGFP.V5.insv 3′UTR (red), progenitors
  in HRP (cyan), and all cell nuclei (DAPI in blue).(D′–E′) Grayscale images of indicated
  channels from (D) and (E). Progenitor cells are labeled with yellow arrowheads.(F)
  Fluorescence intensity of V5 reporter expression in progenitors of control and miR-956[KO]
  mutants stained for smGFP.V5.insv 3′UTR (red).Data shown as mean ± SEM. Significance
  values: ****p < 0.0001. Scale bar, 25 mm. n values in the graphs indicate the number
  of cells quantified from at least five intestines.'
