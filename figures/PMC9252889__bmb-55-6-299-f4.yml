caption: ClC-5 knockdown inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity in CCA cells.
  After shClC-5 transfection, the expression distribution of β-catenin in CCA cells
  was detected by immunofluorescence staining, and the protein levels of Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling related-proteins were detected by Western blot. (A, B) Representative
  immunofluorescence staining images of β-catenin in both QBC939 (A) and SNU-869 (B)
  cells; (C-F) The protein levels of Wnt1, Wnt3, β-catenin, cyclin D1, and c-Myc in
  both QBC939 (C, D) and SNU-869 (E, F) cells. mean ± SD, n = 4; **P < 0.01 vs. shNC
  group.
