caption: Schematic diagram of DA-mediated osteogenic differentiation by modulating
  AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin pathway in rBMSCs. Intracellular p-AKT and p-GSK-3β level was
  downregulated by DA. Subsequently, translocation of β-catenin from the cytoplasm
  to the nucleus was suppressed, resulting in the inhibition of osteogenic differentiation.
