caption: Disruption of SSS causes gut microbiota dysbiosis in Drosophila. (A–E) Representative
  images (A–D) and quantification (E) of the bacterial load in WT, sss P1/sss Δ40
  flies, and rescued flies. The bacterial load in flies was determined by colony count.
  Intestine samples were cultured on NA plates at 30°C. Mean and SD. (F) α‐diversity
  of the bacterial species in gut samples from WT and sss P1/sss Δ40 flies by Wilcoxon
  rank‐sum test. *p < 0.05, NS = not significant. (G) PCA showing significant differences
  in the gut microbiota between WT and sss P1/sss Δ40 flies. (H) Relative abundances
  of bacterial phylum structure in gut samples of WT and sss P1/sss Δ40 flies. (I
  and J) Heatmap of the normalized relative abundance of OTUs significantly changed
  between WT and sss P1/sss Δ40 flies at the class level (I) and order level (J) by
  one‐way ANOVA, p < 0.05. (K–O) Representative images (K–N) and quantification (O)
  of the bacterial load in WT and sss P1/sss Δ40 flies fed with and without antibiotics.
  Mean and SD. (P) Quantification of pH3+ cell number in the gut of (K)–(N). Mean
  and SD. (Q) Total sleep (left) and sleep per hour (right) in WT and sss P1/sss Δ40
  flies fed with and without antibiotics. Mean and SEM. WT = wild type, Student's
  t test, *p < 0.05 **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, NS = not significant.
