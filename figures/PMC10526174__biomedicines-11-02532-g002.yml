caption: (A) Joint pathway analysis of metabolites and transcripts with p < 0.1 between
  Q1 and Q4. (B) Joint pathway analysis of metabolites and proteins with p < 0.1 between
  Q1 and Q4. Red points on the graph indicate a more significant pathway p-value.
  (C) Network analysis integrating metabolites, transcripts, and proteins, using variables
  with a significance level of p < 0.1 between Q1 and Q4 of the total rank order of
  z-scores. The network was constructed using Omicsnet, establishing metabolite-protein
  interactions through mapping to the KEGG database. Gray nodes in the network represent
  transcripts, red nodes represent proteins, and yellow nodes represent metabolites.
  Additionally, red and gray nodes indicate molecules present in both the transcriptomics
  and proteomics datasets. Seed nodes are highlighted with blue orders.
