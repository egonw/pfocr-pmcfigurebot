caption: O-GlcNAcylation maintained normal physiological homeostasis in the liver.
  The HBP regulated the level of O-GlcNAcylation, and OGT catalyzed the transfer of
  single N-acetyl glucosamine from UDP-GlcNAC to the proteins; hydrolysis of a single
  N-acetylglucosamine from the proteins by OGA. O-GlcNAcylation of PGC-1α, FoxO1,
  and CRTC2 increases the expression of gluconeogenic genes and induces hepatic gluconeogenesis.
  O-GlcNAcylated p53 bound to the PCK1 promoter regulated the PCK1 levels and increased
  glucose synthesis. LXR, AMPK, ChREBP, and SREBP-1 were directly or indirectly regulated
  by O-GlcNAcylation, and subsequently, the transcriptional activity of target glycolysis
  and lipogenic genes was increased. HBP, hexosamine biosynthetic pathway; GFAT, glutamine
  fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase; OGT, O-GlcNAc transferase; OGA, O-GlcNAcase;
  CRTC2, cAMP-regulated transcriptional co-activator 2; CREB, cyclic AMP-responsive
  element-binding protein; PGC1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ co-activator1α;
  ChREBP, carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein; AMPK, AMP-activated protein
  kinase; SREBP-1, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1; LXR, liver X receptors;
  ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; FAS, fatty acid synthase; SCD1, stearoyl-CoA desaturase1;
  MnSOD, manganese superoxide dismutase.
