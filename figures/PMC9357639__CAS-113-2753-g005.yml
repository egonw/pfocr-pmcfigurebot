caption: MST2 phosphorylates STAT3 at T622. A, B, D‐G, Immunoblotting analyses were
  performed using indicated antibodies. A, Purified GST‐STAT3 protein was incubated
  with purified WT His‐MST2 or His‐MST2 K56R proteins for an in vitro kinase assay.
  A GST pulldown assay was performed. B, Purified WT GST‐STAT3 or indicated mutant
  protein was incubated with purified WT His‐MST2 for an in vitro kinase assay. A
  GST pulldown assay was performed. C, Alignment analyses of STAT3 T622 among indicated
  species were performed. D, DU145 cells with expression of Flag‐STAT3 at high (H,
  ~80%) or low (L, ~10%) density were harvested and lysed. Immunoprecipitation was
  performed using an anti‐Flag antibody. Immunoblotting analysis was performed in
  the presence or absence of the blocking peptide. E, DU145 cells with expression
  of Flag‐STAT3, MST2 shRNA, or SAV1 shRNA at high (H, ~80%) or low (L, ~10%) density
  were harvested and lysed. Immunoprecipitation was performed using an anti‐Flag antibody.
  F, DU145 cells with expression of WT Flag‐STAT3 or Flag‐STAT3 T622A at high (H,
  ~80%) or low (L, ~10%) density were harvested and lysed. Immunoprecipitation was
  performed using an anti‐Flag antibody. G, Purified WT GST‐STAT3 or GST‐STAT3 T622A
  protein was incubated with purified WT His‐MST2 proteins for an in vitro kinase
  assay
