caption: 'Immunofluorescence imaging of Nrf2 (A–D) translocation after 1 hour of incubation.
  Bar graphs show Nrf2 fluorescence signals throughout the (A) whole cells, within
  the cytosolic (B) and nuclear (C) fraction, and the calculated ratio (nucleus/cytosol,
  D). Images showing immunofluorescence stainings of HCEC-1CT. Images (a–d) show Nrf2
  (red) and nuclei (blue) of HCEC for the following conditions: (a) solvent control,
  (b) CH-22 1 μM, (c) B[a]P 1 μM, and (d) ATX-II 1 μM. Bar graphs depict Nrf2 immunofluorescence
  signals within the respective cell compartment or as the nucleus/cytosol ratio (D)
  presented as mean + SD of at least four individual experiments conducted in a minimum
  of technical duplicates with at least four optical fields per technical replicate.
  The data are normalized to the ratio of the solvent control, and significances were
  calculated applying a two-sample t-test at p < 0.05: *, p < 0.01: **, and p < 0.001:
  ***; asterisks indicate significant differences compared to the solvent control,
  and # marks significant differences of the combinations of a compound and CH-22
  compared to the compound alone. All images were taken using a 20× objective; the
  indicated scale bar applies to all images depicted.'
