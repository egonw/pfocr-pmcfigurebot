caption: Normal functional MAPK/ERK pathway in wild-type (WT) BRAF and its alteration
  in the presence of BRAFV600E mutation and the mechanism of action of drugs targeting
  the mutation. Normal functional MAPK/ERK pathway is activated after extracellular
  signaling, leading to a response in cell cycle control, proliferation, and cellular
  migration. The BRAFV600E mutation induces a self-sustained constant activation of
  the MAPK/ERK pathway, thereby inhibiting controlled cellular death by apoptosis
  via indirect regulation of BAD. The BRAFV600Epathway drastically increases the basal
  levels of proliferation, consistent with oncogenic development. Therefore, the BRAFV600E
  mutation could be targeted for treatment with specific inhibitors, which results
  in an increase in apoptotic activity
