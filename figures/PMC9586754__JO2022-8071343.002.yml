caption: The radiosensitivity of BxPC3-P cells with induced ZFP57 overexpression was
  evaluated. (a) The ZFP57 expression was inhibited by lentiviral transfection. The
  ZFP57 expression was determined in BxPC3-P cells transfected with sh-ZFP57-1, sh-ZFP57-2,
  and the corresponding control by qPCR. After exposure of the BxPC3-P cells transfected
  with sh-ZFP57-2 and the corresponding control to 8 Gy irradiation, (b) the survival
  fraction estimated by colony formation assay. (c) Cell viability revealed by CCK-8
  assay. (d) The expressions of the cell cycle-related proteins cyclin D1 and CDK4;
  apoptosis-related proteins Bax, Bcl-2, and cleaved caspase-3; and DNA repair-related
  protein γ-H2AX revealed by WB assay. (e) The expressions of β-catenin and c-Myc
  revealed by WB assay. ∗∗∗P < 0.001 and ∗∗P < 0.01.
