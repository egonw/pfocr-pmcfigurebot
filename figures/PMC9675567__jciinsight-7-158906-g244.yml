figure_title: Transcriptome analysis of BI 749327–treated DKO mice reveals significantly
  reduced expression of genes involved in lipid synthesis and fibrosis pathways
caption: (A) Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes in BI 749327– and vehicle-treated
  DKO mice (n = 3 biological replicates, female DKO mice, 8 weeks of age; FDR < 0.05).
  (B) PCA analysis of the same data revealed a treated DKO cluster separated from
  vehicle controls. (C) Ingenuity transcription regulatory analysis of proximal signaling
  pathways (all with an absolute activation z score > 2). Dominant downregulated pathways
  involve lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and fibrosis. (D) Volcano plot for differentially
  regulated genes in TKO and DKO mice, showing a similar number of upregulated and
  downregulated genes, with broader log fold changes than with the drug intervention.
  (E) PCA plot comparing DKO and TKO mice as well as DKO mice treated with BI 749327,
  showing separation of both from DKO mice in principal component 1 (PC1). (F) Ingenuity
  pathway analysis of differentially downregulated pathways identified many significant
  pathways shared by BI 749327–treated compared with vehicle-treated DKO mice as well
  as DKO mice compared with TKO mice. Dot size indicates the number of genes differentially
  altered in the pathway, and color indicates the P value. Shared pathways were also
  enriched for lipid and carbohydrate metabolism.
