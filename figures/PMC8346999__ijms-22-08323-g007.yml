caption: A model describing the regulatory role of UBR1 and UBR2 in G-protein signaling
  pathways via mediating RGS protein degradation. In GPCRs (G-protein-coupled receptors),
  heterotrimeric G-proteins are dissociated into G〈 and G®© subunits by external ligands
  or signal mediators. Activated GTP-bound G〈 and G®© stimulate the downstream signaling
  pathway associated with cell growth and cardiovascular development. The proper regulation
  of GTP-Gα activity by GTPase-activating RGS proteins is vital in the GPCR-related
  signaling pathway. Among the RGS proteins, RGS4, RGS5, and RGS16 are cleaved by
  MetAP to expose a cysteine residue at the N-terminus. After which, these RGS proteins
  undergo oxidation, followed by arginylation (C* denotes the oxidized N-terminal
  Cysteine residue). Arginylated RGS proteins are recognized by UBR1 and UBR2 for
  ubiquitination and degradation. When the Arg/N-degron pathway is genetically inhibited,
  metabolically stabilized RGS proteins promote the hydrolysis of the GTP-bounded
  G〈 subunit, which leads to inactivation of the GPCR signaling pathway.
