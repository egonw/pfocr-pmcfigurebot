caption: The TBK1-binding motif is the key for the interaction between pSTING and
  pIKKε.A, sequence alignment of the C-terminal tail (CTT) of STING from porcine,
  human, mouse, and bovine. B, the protein expressions of full-length pSTING, pSTING
  CTT, and their mutants. C and D, the GFP-pSTING or pSTING△TBM was cotransfected
  with mCherry-pIKKε into HEK293T cells for 48 h, followed by co-IP and Western blot
  analysis. E and F, the GFP-pSTING, pSTING CTT, or pSTING CTT△TBM was cotransfected
  with mCherry-pIKKε into HEK293T for 48 h, followed by co-IP and subsequent Western
  blot analysis. co-IP, coimmunoprecipitation; HEK293T, human embryonic kidney 293T
  cell line; pIKK, porcine IKK; STING, stimulator of interferon genes; TBK1, TANK-binding
  kinase 1.
