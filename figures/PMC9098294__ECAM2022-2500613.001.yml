caption: 'Diagrammatic representation of different target sites for the antimicrobial
  agent''s activity on a bacterial cell. ❶ Alteration in PBP: modified PBP is responsible
  for the mechanism of action of resistance seen in Gram-positive bacteria as it produces
  β-lactamases. For example, reduction in affinity of β-lactam antibiotics is due
  to the mutation on penicillin-binding protein. ❷ Efflux pumps: antibiotics are exported
  via the membrane proteins inside the cell and maintain their low-intracellular concentrations
  by pumping them out before they reach their target. Several unrelated antibiotics
  such as macrolides, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones (FQ) are been pumped by
  cytoplasmic membrane-associated multidrug transporters contributing in the development
  of MDR strains. ❸ Inhibitors of DNA replication: inhibition of the bacterial division
  by preventing enzyme DNA gyrase activity (nicks double-stranded DNA and negative
  supercoils and reseals) is facilitated by quinolones like FQ. ❹ Altered cell wall
  precursors: Gram-positive bacteria can be inhibited by glycopeptides like vancomycin
  or teicoplanin as they are involved suppression cell wall synthesis. ❺ DNA mutated-DNA
  gyrase and topoisomerase IV: quinolone mechanism of resistance involves modification
  of two enzymes: DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Replication failure is due to mutations
  in genes gyrA and parC making FQ unable to bind. ❻ Folic acid metabolism inhibitors:
  combination of few drugs like sulphonamides and trimethoprim acts on biosynthetic
  pathway, which shows synergy and a reduced mutation rate for resistance. ❼ Alteration
  in the 30S subunit or 50S subunit: resistance to drugs that affect protein synthesis,
  that is, macrolides, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol, bind to 30S ribosomal subunit,
  whereas chloramphenicol, macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B bind to 50S
  ribosomal subunit to suppress protein synthesis. ❽ Inhibitors of protein synthesis:
  tetracyclines offer resistance by inhibiting integrity of ribosomal structure and
  RNA polymerase mutations conferring resistance to rifampicin. ❾ Antibiotic inactivation
  by enzymes: β-lactamases, aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, and chloramphenicol
  acetyltransferases are the three main enzymes that inactivate antibiotics. ❿ Porins:
  present in the outer membrane. The changed selectivity or decreased in porins stops
  the antimicrobials to act on the pathogens conferring resistance.'
