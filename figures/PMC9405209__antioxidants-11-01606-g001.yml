caption: Whole genomic analysis with NEM as an inhibitor for hydrogen sulfide pathway
  using SW10 cells. (A) The first stage of a three-stage framework for integrating
  triple multi-omics data. The SW10 cell culture was performed for 5 h after NEM treatment.
  (B) The pie chart represents detected genes into five summarized transcript types.
  (C) A scatter plot of pairwise expressed genes. X-axis and y-axis present log2 value
  of normalized gene expression. Red, blue, and gray dots refer to upregulated, downregulated,
  and nonregulation genes. GO terms (D), KEGG pathways (E), and PFAM (F) enrichments
  of upregulated genes are shown. GO terms (G), KEGG pathways (H), and PFAM (I) enrichments
  of downregulated genes are shown. qPCR validation of the RNA-sequencing (Seq) in
  the upregulated (J) and downregulated (K) top 10 genes. Seq, RNA sequencing. Comparisons
  were performed using a Studentâ€™s t-test. ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001.
