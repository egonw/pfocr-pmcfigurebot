caption: 'Expression pattern and enzyme activity of DEGs from the ‘Starch and sucrose
  metabolism’ pathway in oil tea. (A) Regulatory network of sucrose and starch metabolism
  underlying the DEGs in pericarp and seeds. Expression patterns of DEGs included
  in ‘Starch and sucrose metabolism’ pathway are shown in heatmap. (B) Enzyme activity
  of DEGs involved in sugar metabolism in oil tea fruit. Bars represent the mean value
  ± SE (n ≥ 5). The asterisk (p ≤ 0.05) indicates significant differences between
  two unloading stages. P1: pericarp in August; P2: pericarp in September; S1: seeds
  in August; S2: seeds in September.'
