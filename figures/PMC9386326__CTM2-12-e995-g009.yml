caption: GSTZ1 deficiency enhances glucuronic pathway activity. (A) Principal component
  analysis of metabolite signatures in Huh7 cells infected with AdGSTZ1 or AdGFP using
  a metabolomics assay. PC, primary component. (B) Heatmap of differentially expressed
  metabolites subjected to identical treatment conditions as in (A). (C) Overview
  of the glucuronic pathway. (D) Relative changes in intermediate metabolites of the
  glucuronic pathway. (E–G) Uridine 5′‐diphosphate glucuronic acid (UDP‐GlcUA) levels
  in GSTZ1‐OE Huh7 cells (E), GSTZ1‐KO SNU449 cells (F) and Gstz1 −/− mice liver tissues
  (G) quantified by the liquid chromatography‐tandem mass spectrometry (LC‐MS/MS)‐targeted
  metabolomics assay. (H) Transwell migration assays and quantification of the migrated
  cells in hepatoma cells supplemented with or without UDP‐GlcUA (0.5 mM for Huh7,
  1 mM for SK‐Hep1, and 0.5 mM for SNU‐449) for 24 h. The migrated cells were stained
  with crystal violet staining. n = 3 independent experiments. (I) Representative
  immunofluorescence staining of E‐cadherin and vimentin from three independent experiments.
  Scale bar, 100 μm. Data are mean ± SD. p‐Values were derived from an unpaired, two‐tailed
  Student's t‐test in (D–F and H), and Mann–Whitney U test in (G) (**p < .01, ***p < .001).
