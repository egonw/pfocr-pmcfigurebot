caption: Representative structures of arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoid classes
  and associated inflammatory effects. Eicosanoids are derived from arachidonic acids,
  via either the 5-LOX-mediated pathway or COX-1/COX-2-mediated pathway. The 5-LOX-mediated
  pathway gives rise to eicosanoids such as leukotrienes and hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic
  acids, whereas the COX-1/COX-2-mediated pathway produces thromboxanes and prostaglandins.
  These eicosanoids are elevated in ALS disease states and exert pro-inflammatory
  effects. Endocannabinoids are synthesized reversibly from arachidonic acids. Arachidonoyl
  ethanolamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) are endocannabinoids that
  are upregulated in ALS disease states. Binding and subsequent activation of AEA
  and 2-AG to CB1/CB2 receptors activates anti-inflammatory response
