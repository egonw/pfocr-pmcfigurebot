caption: Significant pathway changes associated with Mito-HNK treatment in lung adenoma
  cells. In lung adenoma cells, Mito-HNK treatment decreased the expression of genes
  associated with complex I, OXPHOS, glycolysis, and STAT3 signaling, while the treatment
  increased the expression of genes associated with apoptosis and cell death pathways.
  In addition, Mito-HNK treatment inhibited cysteine and methionine metabolism, fatty
  acid metabolism, the pentose phosphate pathway, and propanoate and the pyruvate
  metabolism, while the treatment hyperpolarized mitochondrial membrane potential
  in lung adenoma cells.
