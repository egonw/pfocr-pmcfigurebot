figure_title: EV-A71, CA16, and EMCV 2C proteins antagonized cGAS-STING signaling
  pathway activation by impairing the interaction between STING and TBK1
caption: (A) HEK-293T cells were transfected with 1 μg of empty vector or the indicated
  FLAG-2C-expressing plasmids, along with 1 μg of empty vector or HA-cGAS plus HA-STING
  expressing plasmids. At 24 hpt, the IFN-β protein amount in the supernatant was
  determined by ELISA, and the expression of 2C was confirmed by Western blotting.
  (B) STING-HEK-293T cells were transfected with increasing amount (0, 3, or 6 μg)
  of the indicated FLAG-2C-expressing plasmids. At 24 hpt, cells were transfected
  with poly(dA:dT) (2 μg/ml) for 12 h. The cells lysates were immunoprecipitated with
  anti-STING antibody. The antibody-antigen complexes were detected using anti-STING,
  TBK1, and FLAG antibodies, respectively. (C) Schematic representation of the structure
  and conserved functional sites in EV-A71 2C protein. The redder the color was, the
  more conservative the sites were. (D, E) HEK-293T cells were transfected with 1
  μg of empty vector or EV-A71 (D), CA16 (E), and EMCV (E) FLAG-2C- or FLAG-2C mutants-expressing
  plasmids, along with 1 μg of empty vector or HA-cGAS plus HA-STING expressing plasmids.
  At 24 hpt, the IFN-β protein amount in the supernatant was determined by ELISA,
  and the expression of 2C was confirmed by Western blotting. (F) STING-HEK-293T cells
  were transfected with 6 μg of empty vector, FLAG-2C- or FLAG-2C mutants-expressing
  plasmids. At 24 hpt, cells were transfected with poly(dA:dT) (2 μg/ml) for 12 h.
  The cells lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-STING antibody. The antibody-antigen
  complexes were detected using anti-STING, TBK1, and FLAG antibodies, respectively.
  (G) HEK-293T cells were transfected with 1 μg of empty vector, FLAG-2C- or FLAG-2C
  mutants-expressing plasmids, and 1 μg of HA-cGAS plus HA-STING expressing plasmids.
  At 24 hpt, expression of IRF3, p-IRF3, and FLAG-2C protein was determined by Western
  blotting. The IRF3 dimerization was detected using native PAGE. Error bars show
  standard deviation. **, P<0.01.
