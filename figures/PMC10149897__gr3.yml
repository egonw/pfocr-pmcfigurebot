caption: BBR modulated gut microbiota metabolite levels in CKD model SD rats. (A)
  Mass spectrometry chromatograms of p-cresol and indole in feces samples (black curve,
  Control group; red curve, Model group; the content of p-cresol in the feces samples
  of the Control group was extremely low). (B) Schematic diagram of the tyrosine–p-cresol–p-cresol
  sulfate and tryptophan–indole–indoxyl sulfate production pathway. (C) The content
  of tryptophan in the feces of rats with CKD after 4 weeks of BBR treatment. (D)
  Indole content in feces of rats with CKD after 4 weeks of BBR treatment. (E) The
  content of indoxyl sulfate in the plasma of rats with CKD after 4 weeks of BBR treatment.
  (F) The content of tyrosine in the feces of rats with CKD after 4 weeks of BBR treatment.
  (G) The content of p-cresol in the feces of rats with CKD after 4 weeks of BBR treatment.
  (H) Plasma levels of p-cresol sulfate in rats with CKD after 4 weeks of BBR treatment.
  The data are shown as mean ± S.D., ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, n = 10.
