figure_title: S. Typhimurium invasion of macrophages suppresses tryptophan kynurenine
  pathway metabolism and 3-HK supplementation upregulates the expression of genes
  associated to gated ion channels activity including that of ionotropic glutamate
  receptors
caption: '(A) Ilustration of bulk RNA-seq analysis from sorted populations of macrophages
  isolated from uninfected and S. Typhimurium infected animals with and without 3-HK
  treatment at 4 hpi. Briefly, 72 hpf embryos were infected or uninfected, 3-HK treated
  or vehicle treated, and at 4 hpi a single cell suspension of groups of 5 embryos
  per condition was prepared for fluorescence activated cell sorting according to
  fluorescence emission (i.e., mCherry+ or mCherry+/GFP+). A range of 8-13 biological
  replicates/condition were collected from 2 independent infection experiments (837.5
  +/− 117.5 CFU and 770 +/− 45 CFU). (B-C) Heatmaps showing selected genes differential
  expression from significant biological processes identified by Gene Set Enrichment
  Analysis in S. Typhimurium invaded versus naïve macrophages. (B) Gene sets belonging
  to pro-inflammatory responses, Salmonella infection, autophagy and (C) tryptophan
  metabolism genes are shown and clustered according to category (FDR < 0.05 for all
  4 pathways). S. Typhimurium invasion of macrophages upregulates genes related to
  pro-inflammatory responses and Salmonella infection, and supresses the antimicrobial
  autophagy response. (D) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis plot of gene sets related to
  gated channel activity in S. Typhimurium invaded macrophages from 3-HK treated animals
  versus untreated animals. 3-HK treatment upregulates the expression of gated ion
  channels in S. Typhimurium invaded macrophages. (E) Cnet plot of leading edge genes
  associated with gated channel activity from the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis in
  (D) highlighing in red genes encoding ionotropic glutamate receptors of the AMPA
  (gria1b, gria3) and Kainate (grik1b) receptors subclasses (padj < 0.05 for all genes
  displayed). NES: normalized enrichment score; FDR: false discovery rate.'
