caption: The development of immune-responsive T cells to BIA-ALCL is hypothesized.
  In short, macrophages will pick up bacteria (A). Interleukin (IL)-1 is created by
  the activation of cell-wall elements (B) and then produces IL-8 through stimulation
  of neutrophil and IL-12 (C), which promotes Th1 mutation. In addition, macrophages
  also cause IL-6 (D), which leads to Th17 cell mutation, and IL-6 also is activated
  through activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway (E). Reproduced with permission
