caption: Aerobic exercised NASH mice display improved hepatic inflammation by RNA-seq.
  (A) Representative enrichment plots of important pathways enriched in the liver
  of NASH mice. (B) Representative enrichment plots of important pathways enriched
  in the liver of NASH+exercise mice. (C) Enrichment plots of oxidative phosphorylation
  signaling pathway enriched in the liver of NASH mice (left) and NASH+exercise mice
  (right). (D) Enrichment plots of lipid homeostasis signaling pathway enriched in
  the liver of NASH+exercise mice. (E) Enrichment plots of fibrosis-related pathway
  enriched in the liver of NASH+exercise mice. (F) Enrichment plots of thyroid hormone
  metabolic process signaling pathway enriched in the liver of NASH+exercise mice.
