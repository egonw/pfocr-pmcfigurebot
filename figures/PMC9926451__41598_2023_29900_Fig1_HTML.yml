caption: BCG infection induces apoptosis in THP-1 cells and promotes the expression
  of DUSP1 and pro-inflammatory cytokines. (A, C) DUSP1 protein expression detected
  by Western blotting after 6 h of BCG infection of THP-1 cells at different MOI.
  (B, D–F) DUSP1, Cleaved-Caspase3 and Cleaved-PARP1 protein expression detected by
  Western blotting after BCG (MOI = 10) infection at different time points. (G, H)
  Gene expression of TNF-α and IL-1β detected by RT-qPCR after different times of
  BCG infection (MOI = 10). (I, J) After BCG infection of THP-1 cells for 6 h, the
  apoptosis rate was detected by flow cytometry. (K) After BCG infection of THP-1
  cells for 6 h, the ultrastructure of macrophages was observed by transmission electron
  microscopy (10,000 ×), the blue arrow denotes the cytoplasmic vacuole of apoptotic
  cells, while the red arrow indicates the nucleus. Scale bar, 2 μm. All data are
  represented as mean ± SD (n = 3). (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).
