caption: Relative ALP activity in response to MAPK pathway inhibitors. hDPSCs were
  spread onto non-TCPP plates coated with 1 M RGD-3 or dH2O (control) and were then
  exposed to 20 Î¼M of one of three MAPK pathway inhibitors (SP600125 for JNK, SB202190
  for p38, and PD98059 for ERK) on day 6 in serum-free DMEM for 2 h. Then, the medium
  was changed. ALP activity was assessed on days 8 (A) and 22 (B). p38 inhibitor neutralizes
  the effect of RGD-3 on hDPSC differentiation on both days. n = 3, different lowercase
  characters denote significant differences compared to the control (p < 0.05 vs.
  control).
