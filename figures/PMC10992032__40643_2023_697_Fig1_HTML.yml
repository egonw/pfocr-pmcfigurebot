caption: 'Metabolic pathway of lycopene synthesis in Y. lipolytica. In the upstream
  pathway, lycopene precursors are produced from acetyl-CoA via the MVA pathway; in
  the downstream pathway, crt genes achieve the heterogeneous biosynthesis of lycopene
  in Y. lipolytica. The blue-colored text indicates the endogenous enzymes of Y. lipolytica,
  whereas the text in red indicates the heterogenous enzymes. ERG10/AtoB: acetyl-CoA
  thiolase, ERG13: HMG-CoA synthase, HMG1/HMGR: 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme
  A reductase, ERG12: mevalonate kinase, ERG8: phosphomevalonate kinase, ERG19: mevalonate
  diphosphate decarboxylase, IDI: IPP isomerase, ERG20: geranyl/farnesyl diphosphate
  synthase, GGS1/crtE: geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, crtB: phytoene synthase,
  crtI: phytoene desaturase, MVA: mevalonic acid, IPP: isopentenyl diphosphate, DMAPP:
  dimethylallyl diphosphate, GPP: geranyl pyrophosphate, FPP: farnesyl diphosphate,
  GGPP: geranylgeranyl diphosphate'
