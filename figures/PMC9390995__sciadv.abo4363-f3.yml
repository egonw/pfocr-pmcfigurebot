figure_title: Z583 selectively inhibited the JAK3-dependent signaling pathway in hPBMCs
caption: '(A) Four JAK subtypes (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and Tyk2) relay intracellular signal
  transduction with combinations of heterodimers or homodimers. (B) JAKs and STATs
  engage associated cytokines to mediate biological function. hPBMCs or CD34+ cells
  (for EPO) with or without various concentrations of Z583 were stimulated with JAK3-particular
  γc cytokines (C and E) or other cytokines (D and F). Western blots were carried
  out to evaluate the expression of cytokine-associated STAT phosphorylation. All
  data are from three independent experiments. Data are presented as means ± SEM.
  ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001 versus control group and *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P
  < 0.001 versus alone cytokine-stimulating group. ns, no statistical significance.'
article_title: A highly selective JAK3 inhibitor is developed for treating rheumatoid
  arthritis by suppressing γc cytokine–related JAK-STAT signal.
