caption: 'Arbutin promoted the proliferation and migration of HaCAT and DFL cells
  after induced by heat stress by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway. (a) HaCAT and DFL
  cells treated with solvent, 100 μmol/L arbutin (Ar), and arbutin (100 μmol/L) + LY294002
  (50 μmol/L) for 48 hours after 43°C-50 min heat stress; statistically compared the
  value of OD450 in the detection of CCK8 (n = 3). (b) PCNA protein expression in
  HaCAT and DFL cells of different groups detected by Western blotting. (c) Statistically
  compared expression of PCNA protein in (b) (n = 3). (d) Transwell chamber for determining
  the migration of HaCAT and DFL cells in different groups. (e) Statistically compared
  the number of cells that have migrated in (d) (n = 3). P value was calculated by
  one-way ANOVA. ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. the control group; ###P < 0.001 vs. the solvent
  group; &&&P < 0.001 vs. the Ar group.'
