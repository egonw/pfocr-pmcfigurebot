caption: 'PRMT5 inhibition boosts lymphocyte infiltration in MYC-driven HCC. MYC-ON
  mice were treated with vehicle or 50 mg/kg GSK3326595 for 2 weeks after the MYC
  transgene was activated for 8 weeks. (A) Heatmap of the differentially expressed
  genes (fold change >1.5, adjusted P value (P-adj) < 0.05). (B) Volcano plot. The
  blue dots represent the differential expressed genes (P-adj < 0.05). The top 30
  significant genes were labeled. (C) The top KEGG pathway enrichments (false discovery
  rate [FDR] < 0.05). The red highlighted up-regulated pathways, and blue highlighted
  down-regulated pathways. (D) Relative reads per kilobase million (RPKM; top) and
  mRNA levels (bottom) of MHC II–related genes in the liver tumors. n = 3/group. (E)
  Representative immunofluorescence staining of CD45.1, CD74, and MHC II in the liver
  tumors. Scale bar, 50 μm. (F) Representative immunofluorescence staining of CD4
  and CD8 in the liver tumors. Scale bar, 50 μm. *P < 0.05. Abbreviations: Akr, aldo-keto
  reductase; Bsn, bassoon; CAMS, cell adhesion molecules; Clec7a, C-type lectin domain
  family 7, member a; Col5a3, collagen, type V, alpha 3; Comp, cartilage oligomeric
  matrix protein; Cxxc, CpG-binding protein; ECM, extracellular matrix; FC EPISILON
  RI, a cell-surface receptor for the constant fragment region of immunoglobulin E
  molecules; IGA, Immunoglobulin A; Igsf, immunoglobulin superfamily; JAK, Janus kinase;
  Jund, jun D proto-oncogene; NOD, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain; Pklr,
  pyruvate kinase liver and red blood cell; Pla2g2d, phospholipase A2, group IID;
  Rbp, retinol binding protein; Scml, scm polycomb group protein like; Shank2, SH3
  and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 2; Slc, solute carrier family; STAT, signal
  transducer and activator of transcription; Stx, Shiga toxin; TCA, trichloroacetic
  acid; Thy, thymus cell antigen.'
