caption: The analysis of DEGs from different pathways by qRT-PCR. (A) qRT-PCR-based
  the relative expression level analysis of genes involved in the GA biosynthesis
  pathway. (B) qRT-PCR-based the relative expression level analysis of genes involved
  in the GA signaling pathway. (C) qRT-PCR-based the relative expression level analysis
  of genes involved in the phenylalanine biosynthesis process. (D) qRT-PCR-based the
  relative expression level analysis of genes involved in cell division and cell expansion
  processes. (E) qRT-PCR-based the relative expression level analysis of genes involved
  in the auxin signaling process. CK, normal condition groups without GA treatment.
  GA, exogenous GA treatment groups applied 50 mg/L GA. 1d, GA1d vs. CK1d; 3d, GA3d
  vs. CK3d; 7d, GA7d vs. CK7d; 14d, GA14d vs. CK14d. Data are shown with the mean
  ± SD of three biological replicates. The significant differences between CK and
  GA were compared using student’s t-test (***, p < 0.001).
