caption: Temporal regulation of glycerolipid metabolism in HepG2 cells. The most abundant
  GPLs in hepatic cells, PC and PE, are mainly synthetized by the de novo Kennedy
  pathway. The enzymes and pathways labeled with a clock indicate a significant temporal
  variation at the level of mRNAs and/or proteins or endogenous lipid content in cultures
  of HepG2 cells (Bmal1-WT) synchronized by a pulse of DEX at time 0. The endogenous
  GPL content, the PC/PE ratio, the expression of key regulatory GPL synthesizing
  enzymes (mRNAs and proteins) (black line) such as for Chokα, Pemt, Pcyt2, and Lipin1
  for PC, PE, or TG biosynthesis, together with LD levels (size and number) displayed
  sustained temporal oscillations with periods ranging from 12 to 24 h. By contrast,
  when the molecular clock gene Bmal1 was knocked down (B-D cells) (gray line), most
  transcriptional and metabolic rhythms were severely perturbed, some of them damped
  with a decreased amplitude (Chokα), others upregulated (Lipin1 mRNA) or phase shifted
  (Pemt). In addition, the rate limiting enzyme for PC synthesis, CCTβ, changed its
  intracellular location from cytoplasm in B-WT cells to nucleus in B-D cells, while
  lactate levels increased significantly, and LDs decreased in amplitude for area
  and size. Overall, the circadian disruption in HepG2 cell cultures strongly suggests
  a tight link between the molecular circadian clock and GPL metabolism. Cho, choline;
