caption: 'Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) pathway analysis: (A,B) CCK-8
  assays were used to determine the optimal concentrations of the mTOR activator (AY-22989)
  and inhibitor (3-MA). (C,D) Levels of mTOR and downstream regulators (VMP1 and ULK1)
  in myoblasts were detected by Western blotting after treatment with AY-22989 or
  3-MA. GAPDH was used as an internal control. Replicates = 3. Data are presented
  as the mean Â± SE; * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01. The different letters represented
  the significant difference.'
