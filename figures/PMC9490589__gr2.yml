caption: PCOS depletes the muscle NAD + metabolome. Levels of NAD+, NADH and nicotinamide
  (NAM) in muscle (A–C) and liver (D–F) of PCOS mice treated with or without NMN.
  These metabolites form part of the recycling pathway for NAD+synthesis, shown in
  G. Metabolites measured by mass spectrometry and normalised to tissue weight. n = 6–8
  per group and data expressed as mean ± SD. Analysed by one-way ANOVA with a post-hoc
  Dunnett's multiple comparison test, p-value results as indicated on graphs.
