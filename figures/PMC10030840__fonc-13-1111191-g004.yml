caption: Location of candidate variants in NTHL1, EXO1, FANCC, ERCC5 and NEIL1 identified
  in all study groups. The coding regions and protein domains of candidate genes NTHL1
  (NM_002528.7), EXO1 (NM_130398.4), FANCC (NM_000136.3), ERCC5 (NM_000123.4) and
  NEIL1 (NM_024608.4), based on NCBI RefSeq transcripts (tark.ensembl.org/web/manelist/)
  (), were annotated for the location of candidate variants. Variants classified as
  PV or LPV are bolded and those identified in French Canadian ovarian cancer cases
  each are indicated with an arrow.
article_title: Genetic analyses of DNA repair pathway associated genes implicate new
  candidate cancer predisposing genes in ancestrally defined ovarian cancer cases.
