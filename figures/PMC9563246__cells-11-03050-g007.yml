caption: 'Thyroid hormone (T4)-induced PD-L1-dependent protein expression and cell
  proliferation in oral cancer cells. (A). Oral cancer OEC-M1 cells were seeded in
  six-well trays and were transfected with either PD-L1 shRNA or a scrambled plasmid
  (0.5 μg/well). Prior to treatment, cells were refed with hormone-stripped FBS-containing
  medium and treated with T4 (10−7 M) for 24 h. Cells were harvested, and Western
  blot analyses of total β-catenin, pβ-catenin, PD-L1, and pERK1/2 were conducted.
  Data are presented as the mean ± SD. Results are from three independent studies
  (n = 4) ** p < 0.01, compared to the control. I.O.D., intensity of the optical density.
  (B). Oral cancer OEC-M1 cells were seeded in 24-well trays and were transfected
  with either PD-L1 shRNA or a scrambled plasmid (0.1 μg/well). Prior to treatment,
  cells were refed with hormone-stripped FBS-containing medium and treated with T4
  (10−7 M) for 72 h. Cells were harvested for cell viability assay. Data are presented
  as the mean ± SD. Results are from three independent studies (n = 6) * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, compared to the control; # p < 0.05, ### p < 0.001,
  compared to T4, and $ p < 0.05, $$$ p < 0.001, compared to PD-L1 shRNA group.'
