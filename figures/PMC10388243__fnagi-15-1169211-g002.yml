caption: Oxidative stress affects EGFR and PRDX6 in ARPE-19 cells. (A) Western blot
  results of EGFR and PRDX6 after ARPE-19 cells were treated with different concentrations
  of H2O2 for 6 h. (B) Quantitative analysis of western blot results from three independent
  experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, compared with the control. (C) Immunofluorescence
  staining of ARPE-19 cells after treatment with 300 μM H2O2 for 6 h. EGFR (green),
  PRDX6 (green), phalloidin (red), and DAPI (blue). Scale bar = 20 μm.
