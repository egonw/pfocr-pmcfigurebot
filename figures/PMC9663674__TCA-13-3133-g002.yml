caption: Circ‐EIF3I regulated NOVA2 expression by sponging miR‐1253. A549 and H1299
  cells were transfected with si‐NC, si‐circ‐EIF3I, si‐circ‐EIF3I + anti‐miR‐NC or
  si‐circ‐EIF3I + anti‐miR‐1253. (a), (b) The mRNA and protein expression levels of
  NOVA2 were detected by qRT‐PCR and WB analysis. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001,
  ****p < 0.0001. NOVA2, neuro‐oncological ventral antigen 2; mRNA, messenger RNA;
  qRT‐PCR, quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction; WB, western blot
article_title: Circ‐EIF3I facilitates proliferation, migration, and invasion of lung
  cancer via regulating the activity of Wnt/β‐catenin pathway through the miR‐1253/NOVA2
  axis.
