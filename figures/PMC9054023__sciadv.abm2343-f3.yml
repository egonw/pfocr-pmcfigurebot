figure_title: Loading and translocation of effectors from T3SS, T4SS, T6SS, and T7SS
caption: (A) Loading of diverse T3SS effectors into PVC under the guidance of Pnf
  or Pdp1 N50-SP. (B) Cytotoxicity assays of J774 host cells after treatment with
  PVC harboring ExoU for 24 hours. Cell viability was measured using water-soluble
  tetrazalium 8 (WST-8) as the substrate. The concentration of PVC solution for each
  sample was 250 μg ml−1. Error bars show the means and SD of three independent experiments
  (n = 3). (C) p65 proteins from nuclear factor κB signaling pathway in host cells
  were cleaved by PVC-delivered NleC effectors. (D) Loading of several T4SS effectors
  into PVC complex by SP guidance. (E) Akt proteins from host cells were activated
  by PVC-delivered Helicobacter pylori CagA effectors. J774 cells were treated with
  relative PVC solutions for 30 min, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (50 μg ml−1) was
  used as positive control. (F) Loading of multiple T6SS effectors into PVC complex.
  (G) Loading of T7SS effectors from Mycobacteria into PVC complex by SP guidance.
  (H) Cytotoxicity assays after treatment with PVC harboring EsxA from Mycobacterium
  tuberculosis for 48 hours. Cell viability were measured using WST-8 as the substrates.
  The concentration of PVC solution for each sample was 250 μg ml−1. Error bars show
  the means and SD of three independent experiments (n = 3).
