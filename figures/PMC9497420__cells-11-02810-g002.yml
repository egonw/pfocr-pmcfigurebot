caption: T helper cell 17 (Th17)-specific transcription factor RORC and proinflammatory
  cytokine TNF are upregulated in Tregs from the cigarette smoke plus morphine (SM
  + M)-treated group. (A) A schematic figure showed the interaction between cytokines
  and their receptors to induce a signaling pathway. (B) The Venn diagram analysis
  showed that SM + M, morphine (M), and cigarette smoke (SM) specifically upregulated
  the expressions of 44, 21, and 8 cytokines and their interactors respectively after
  screening for a total of 1176 cytokines and their interactors (https://www.proteinatlas.org/search/cytokine
  accessed on 10 May 2019) in splenic CD4+ Tregs. (C) SM + M, M, and SM specifically
  upregulated the expressions of three, three, and zero chemokines, respectively,
  after screening for a total of 200 chemokines in mouse splenic CD4+ Tregs. (D) Cytokine
  signaling and innate immune response to LPS are the cytokine pathways upregulated
  in SM + M treated Tregs. The metascape pathway analysis showed that upregulated
  cytokines induced by SM + M, M, and SM in splenic CD4+ Tregs have 20, 13, and 3
  signaling pathways, respectively. In addition, the SM + M upregulated cytokine group
  in Tregs has 10 signaling pathways overlapped with that of SM in Tregs.
