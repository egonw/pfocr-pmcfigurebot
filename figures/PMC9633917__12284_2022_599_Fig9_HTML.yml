caption: 'A landscape of molecular response in rice leaves at early stage of salt
  stress. The left panel: The salt treatment induced water shortage, ABA signaling
  and ROS burst. These signals would affect upper part of rice plants through several
  different pathways after several hours of salt stress. (1) ABA and ROS transports
  to leaves and close stomata and disturb photosynthetic metabolism, which will cause
  over excessive generation of ROS, and subsequently destroy the membrane system of
  cells if the ROS cleavage system does not function efficiency, finally make cell
  death and leave senescence (Apel and Hirt ; Chaves et al. ; Hu et al. ). (2) At
  early stage of salt stress, water shortage triggered ROS burst down regulated chloroplast
  development and photosynthetic components (Formentin et al. ), which will subsequently
  reduce photosynthesis activity in leaf cells, and then reduce the ROS accumulation
  (Huang et al. ; Ponce et al. ; Wang et al. ). (3) ROS and ABA and other plant hormone
  signaling turn down the ribosome, which is responsible for protein synthesis. Reduction
  protein synthesis will reduce energy consumption of the plants (Moin et al. ). However,
  basic protein synthetic activity is still necessary, because stress proteins are
  required for stress tolerance. (4) Genes involved in carbohydrate and amino acids
  metabolism were regulated to a new balance status after sensing the ROS, ABA and
  other hormone signals (Ponce et al. ). This pathway and (3) participates in regulation
  of protein biosynthesis, modulating abundance of stress proteins, such as ROS cleavages
  (Ponce et al. ). The integrated regulations in different pathways at early stage
  of salt stress may finally control longevity of leaves under continuous salt stress
  conditions (Hu et al. ). Other regulations not discussed here could also found from
  (Ponce et al. ). The right panel: Expressions of genes responsible for these modulations
  could be regulated through a variety-specific manner on both transcriptional and
  mRNA splicing levels'
