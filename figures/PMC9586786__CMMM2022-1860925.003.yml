caption: Changes in microvessel density. All changes in microvessel density in this
  study were entered by the author into excel software, and the statistical processing
  software was calculated by SPSS25.0, expressed as mean ± standard deviation, and
  found by independent samples t-test. The number of Hes1+factor VIII positive cells
  in the ischemic cortex after 6 hours of perfusion was lower than normal, and there
  was a statistically significant difference between the control group and the 6 h
  group by t-test (P <0.05). The number of factor-positive cells increased significantly,
  and there was a significant difference compared with the control group, with statistical
  significance (P <0.05).
