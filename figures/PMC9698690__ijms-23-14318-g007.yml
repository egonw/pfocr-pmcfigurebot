caption: Analysis of Cd tolerance function of StSRO6 heterologous expression in eukaryotic
  cells. (A) Wild-type yeast strain BY4741 (positive control), cadmium-sensitive mutant
  Δycf1 (negative control), and overexpressed StSRO6-Δycf1 strain were dilution (100,
  10−1, 10−2, 10−3, 10−4) cultured in different Cd content (0, 15, and 30 μM) on synthetic
  galactose-uracil (SG-U)deficiency minimal medium, thus after 7 days, the growth
  phenotypes of the different strains were observed. (B) Biomass changes of three
  yeast strains at different time points. (C) Detection of Cd content in three yeast
  strains after stable growth (7 d).
