caption: Highly expressed SOCS1 in human primary T cells inhibited T cell activation.
  A) SOCS1 was overexpressed by lentivirus in CD3+ T cells from healthy donor bone
  marrow. Quantitative real‐time (RT)‐PCR was used to detect SOCS1 expression levels.
  B) Flow cytometric analysis of proliferation in GFP+ cells. C,D) Percentage of Ki67+
  cells in CD4+ cells (C) or CD8+ cells (D). E) The expression level of TIGIT detected
  by flow cytometry. F) IL‐4 and IL‐10 secretion levels in GFP+CD4+ T cells. G) Gene
  pathway enrichment analysis for the upregulated genes and downregulated genes in
  SOCS1‐overexpressing T cells compared with control T cells. Error bars represent
  the mean ± SEM values from 3 independent experiments, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.
