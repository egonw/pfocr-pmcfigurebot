caption: 'Histological analysis of new bone formation 3 months after scaffold implantation
  in rabbits. The new bone is red and the scaffold is black. (A) Physical image of
  the scaffold, (B) EDS of the Ti6Al4V scaffolds, (C) EDS of the SLA-treated + GOQDs
  + Ti6Al4V scaffolds, and (D) HE staining image of a superhard tissue section 3 months
  after the scaffold was implanted into the rabbit. The bone tissue is red and the
  Ti6Al4V scaffold is black. The light white or light red in the contact surface between
  the scaffold and the bone tissue is the new bone tissue. (E) Proportion of the new
  bone area on the scaffold after HE staining and (F) VG-stained image of a superhard
  tissue section 3 months after the scaffold was implanted into the rabbit. The bone
  tissue is red and the Ti6Al4V scaffold is black. The light white or light yellow
  in the contact surface between the scaffold and the bone tissue is the new bone
  tissue. (G) Proportion of new bone area on the scaffold after VG staining. Scale
  bars, 1000 μm (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001, compared with SLA + GOQDs;
  #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, and ###p < 0.001, compared with control).'
