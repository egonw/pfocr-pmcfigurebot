caption: Protective role of miR-129-5p in preventing tumoral progression in different
  types of cancer. Overstimulation of miR129 targets WNT signaling pathway resulting
  in decreasing hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) and HCC risk. Upregulation of
  miR-129-5p decreases COL1A1, ADAM 9 protein, and HMGB protein, lowering gastric
  cancer risk and decreasing IPO7 protein, resulting in suppressing pancreatic cancer
  proliferation.
