caption: ATF7 inhibits SASP secretion by inhibiting NF-κB signaling and modulating
  H3K9me2 in HDFs. (A) Western blot analysis of NF-κB signaling pathway activation
  in control and ATF7-overexpressing HDFs (n = 4 biological replicates). (B) Qualification
  results of (A). (C) Co-immunoprecipitation of ATF7 and G9a. Cell lysates of HDFs
  were immunoprecipitated with anti-ATF7 antibody or control IgG, with immunocomplexes
  then subjected to western blotting using G9a (n = 2 biological replicates). (D)
  ChIP assay with qRT-PCR detection of H3K9me2 abundance in SASP genes at ATF7-binding
  sites of promoter regions in control and ATF7-overexpressing HDFs (n = 4 biological
  replicates for IL6 and p16, n = 5 biological replicates for other genes). OE, overexpression.
  Statistical analyses were performed using two-sided Student’s t-test.
