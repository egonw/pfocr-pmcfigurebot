caption: Ozonated water suppresses BELL7402 cell proliferation. (A) Liver cancer cell
  lines were treated with various concentrations of ozone (2.0,1.5,1.0 μg/mL) for
  10 min, observe the morphology of cells. (B) Liver cancer cell lines were treated
  with various concentrations of ozone (2.2, 1.69, 1.51, or 1.09 μg/mL) for 10 min,
  24h incubation Cell proliferation was assessed using a CCK-8 kit. *(C) Liver cancer
  cell lines were treated with 1.5μg/mL concentrations of ozone for 10 min, 24h, 36h,
  48h incubation Cell proliferation was assessed using a CCK-8 kit. (D) Cell cycle
  detection by flow cytometry ****P<0.0001, n=3.
