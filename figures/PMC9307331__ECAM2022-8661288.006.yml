caption: 'Loureirin A suppresses the TGF-β1/Smad signalling pathway in TGF-β1-induced
  KFs. The protein expression levels of p-Smad2 and p-Smad3 were detected by Western
  blotting. The data are presented as the mean ± SEM. ∗P < 0.05 compared with the
  TGF-β1 group. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 compared with the control group. Each assay
  was performed in triplicate and repeated using four independent cell samples (n = 4,
  12 samples).'
