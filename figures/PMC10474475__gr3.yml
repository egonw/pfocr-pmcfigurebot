caption: Characteristics of the consensus models(A) Sizes of M1- and M2-specific models,
  including shared (purple) genes, reactions, and metabolites, and components only
  found in the M1 (red) or M2 (blue) models.(B) Comparison of the pathway composition
  for M1 and M2 models, relative to the pathway size in Recon3D. The pathways significantly
  enriched in M1 and M2 are marked with a red or blue asterisk, respectively.(C) Results
  from FEA for the presence or absence of M1 and M2 metabolic pathways. Red and blue
  dotted lines represent significant values of p = 0.05 for M1 and M2 models, respectively;
  the diagonal line represents the case where M1 and M2 subsystems are equally enriched.
