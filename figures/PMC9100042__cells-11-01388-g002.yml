caption: Dynamic regulation of the KEAP1-NRF2 pathway during neural differentiation.
  (A) Heatmaps showing the differential gene expression pattern of known NRF2-pathway
  specific genes across differentiation of lt-NES cultures. Data were generated using
  an Affymetrix transcriptome microarray. Expression levels (log2 scale) for each
  gene were averaged across samples and differences are depicted as standard deviation
  changes. Clustering analysis was performed by multigroup comparison (n = 2). (B,C)
  Protein expression of NRF2 pathway components was assessed by immunoblot analysis
  at indicated weeks (w) of lt-NES cell differentiation. (B) Protein levels of the
  NRF2 downstream targets NQO1 and TXNRD1 increase during neural differentiation.
  (C) NRF2/KEAP1 protein levels decrease during neural differentiation.
