caption: 'Huangqin decoction protects hepatocytes by triggering Sirt1/NF-κB pathway
  in palmitic acid-induced HepG2 cells. Data are presented as mean ± SD of at least
  three independent experiments. aP < 0.01 vs the control group, bP < 0.05 and cP
  < 0.01 vs the palmitic acid group, dP < 0.05 and eP < 0.01 vs the Huangqin decoction
  group. A and B: Levels of triacylglycerol (A) and total cholesterol (B) in HepG2
  cells co-cultured with or without EX-527; C-E: Levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β,
  and tumor necrosis factor-α in HepG2 cells co-cultured with or without EX-527; F:
  Level of glucose uptake in HepG2 cells co-cultured with or without EX-527; G: Representative
  micrographs of Oil Red O staining of HepG2 cells co-cultured with or without EX-527;
  H: Expression levels of Sirt1, p-NF-κB/NF-κB, p-IRS-2/IRS-2, sterol regulatory element-binding
  protein-1c, fatty acid synthase, and cluster of differentiation 36 in HepG2 cells
  co-cultured with or without EX-527; I-N: Semi-quantitative analysis of these proteins;
  O: Representative images of immunofluorescent staining of Sirt1 and NF-κB in HepG2
  cells co-cultured with or without EX-527. 2DG: 2-deoxydglucose; CD36: Cluster of
  differentiation 36; DAPI: 4'',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; FAS: Fatty acid synthase;
  GAPDH: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HQD: Huangqin decoction; IL: Interleukin;
  PA: Palmitic acid; SREBP: Sterol regulatory element-binding protein; TC: Total cholesterol;
  TG: Triacylglycerol; TNF: Tumor necrosis factor.'

  resistance in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease by triggering Sirt1/NF-κB pathway.
