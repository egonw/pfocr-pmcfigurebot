caption: Beta 2-adrenergic agonist activates PKA signaling pathway, followed by promoted
  PPARγ expression and lipid droplet synthesis. (A) HMGECs were treated with salbutamol
  and phosphorylation of CREB at ser133 residue, which was assessed by immunoblotting
  in serial and dose escalation manners. After treatment with salbutamol (1 μM), the
  CREB phosphorylation was assessed with time. CREB phosphorylation was highest at
  15 min after treatment and decreased thereafter. After salbutamol was treated by
  concentration, CREB phosphorylation was examined 15 min later. CREB phosphorylation
  increased with salbutamol concentration. (B–E) HMGECs were cultured with or without
  salbutamol (1 μM; salbutamol was treated at day 0 and 2). (B,C) Transcription and
  protein expression of PPARγ and SREBP-1 were assessed by quantitative PCR and immunoblotting
  at day 0, 2, and 4. (D,E) Lipid synthesis was measured by AdipoRed assay and LipidTOX
  assay at day 4. All results are the sum of three independent experiments. Data are
  presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean. D, day after differentiation;
  * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001.
