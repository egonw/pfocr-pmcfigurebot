caption: TNFAIP3 and TLR7 gene variants and SLE/LN. TNFAIP3 encodes A20, an inhibitor
  of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB that is activated by TLR7. This
  means that A20 and TLR7 can be traced to the same intracellular signaling pathway
  and have the potential for clinically relevant interactions. Several severe LOF
  TNFAIP3 variants cause Mendelian SLE/LN, as do several GOF TLR7 gene variants. These
  variants with a severe impact on function are generally associated with severe,
  early onset disease, but this may represent the tip of the iceberg, as milder variants
  may exist that cause late-onset disease that has not yet being characterized, just
  as familial hypocholesteremia was initially identified in patients having coronary
  artery disease in childhood. Additionally, even milder gene variants, with the potential
  to be present in genetic databases from the general population (Table ) and that
  are considered benign when isolated, may contribute to polygenic risk for more classical
  forms of SLE/LN, especially when associated with risk variants of the other gene.

  a novel pathway for Mendelian lupus and lupus nephritis.
