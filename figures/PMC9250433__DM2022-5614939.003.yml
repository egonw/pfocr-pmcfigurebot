caption: 'Effects of different types of treatments and no treatment on the cell cycle,
  apoptosis, and expression of corresponding proteins in PC-9 and A549 cells. (a)
  Cell cycle changes detected with flow cytometry. (b) Flow cytometry showing the
  apoptosis and corresponding analysis via bar charts showing the apoptosis rates
  in the cells. (c) Corresponding protein expression levels under different treatments
  and no treatments via Western blot. ∗P < 0.05 for comparison between the treatment
  groups and the sham group; #P < 0.05 for comparison between the 1 mg/ml UBE group
  and the UBE + PEM group.'
