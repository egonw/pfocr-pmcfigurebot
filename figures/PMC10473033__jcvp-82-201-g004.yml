caption: 'Changes in α-SMA expression after sRLX treatment. A, Immunostaining of α-SMA
  (red) and vimentin (green). Bar = 100 µm. B, Average optical density of α-SMA in
  the study and control groups. IOD, integrated optical density. C, Relative cell
  surface areas were quantified using ImageJ software and data are expressed as %
  of the control. Data are represented as the mean ± SD from 5 independent experiments
  performed in duplicate. *P < 0.05 versus the control group, #P < 0.05 versus LPS
  group. &P < 0.05 versus LPS + sRLX group. GW, GW9662.'
