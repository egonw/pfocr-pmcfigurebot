figure_title: Smoothness of metabolic pathways in the principal odor map (POM)
caption: '(a) Left: a four-step pathway (DIBOA-glucoside biosynthesis) depicted in
  a 2D representation of the structure fingerprints (count-based fingerprints, or
  cFP) using principal components analysis. Right: the same pathway depicted in a
  2D representation of the POM. (b) Left: the same 2D cFP representation for a six-step
  pathway (gibberellin biosynthesis). Right: a 2D representation of the same pathway
  in the POM. We observe relatively smooth trajectories in POM for these pathways
  even though the same pathways show irregular trajectories in the structure space.
  (c) To systematically quantify such ‘smoothness,’ we examine all unique pathways
  in the metabolic network (top). A desirable molecular representation should exhibit
  smooth reaction paths, proceeding in a more consistent direction from the starting
  metabolite to the final metabolite allowing interpolation for intermediate metabolites
  (center). Smoothness for an intermediate metabolite is formally defined as the ratio
  between the direct euclidean distance and total path length between the start and
  end metabolites. A smoother path will result in a ratio close to 1 (bottom). (d)
  Metabolic trajectories are smoother after metabolite structures are projected to
  POM than when using alternative structural distance metrics (paired t-test, p<0.0001
  for both structure distance metrics).'
