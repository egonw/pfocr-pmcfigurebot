caption: SMAD3 (p.I67S) mutation stimulated osteoclastogenesis in vitro.(A) CD14(+)
  PBMCs from patient and age- and gender matched healthy control were cultured in
  the presence of M-CSF and RANKL. The age of the matched control donor is 22 years
  old. TRAP staining was performed after 6 days visualized osteoclasts. (B) Measurement
  of osteoclast number (per well) and area occupied by multinucleated osteoclasts
  (per well). n = 3; *, P < 0.05; Student's t-test). (C) Increased expression of osteoclast
  marker genes in osteoclasts by SMAD3 (p.I67S). n = 1 with technical replicates,
  therefore no significance presented (D) Decreased TGF-β signaling in osteoclasts
  with the SMAD3 (p.I67S) mutation. n = 1 with technical replicates, therefore no
  significance presented.
