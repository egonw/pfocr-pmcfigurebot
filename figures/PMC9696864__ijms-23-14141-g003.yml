caption: 'Results of MWT and TWL of all groups. (A) Changes in MWT values. (B) Changes
  in TWL values. At the end of the seventh week, MWT and TWL in the P2X7 shRNA and
  p38 inhibitor groups were higher than in the DNP group. The X-axis means the time
  of measuring behavior and drug administration, the detailed descriptions of 0, 1,
  5, 6 and 7 are given in the ; data are shown as mean ± SEM based on at least three
  independent experiments, n = 6; ** p < 0.01 versus the Control group; ## p < 0.01
  versus the DNP group.'
