caption: Identification and validation of the biomarkers for head and neck squamous
  cell carcinoma (HNSCC). (A) Venn diagram of the top 30 HNSCC-associated candidates
  selected by Cytoscape analysis, depending on the MCC (Maximal Clique Centrality),
  MNC (Maximum Neighborhood Component), EPC (Edge Percolated Component), and Degree
  algorithms. (B) Significant enriched Gene Ontology (GO) pathway signaling for the
  19 potential biomarkers. (C) Significant enriched GO biological process terms for
  the 19 potential biomarkers. (D) Expression levels of ITGA5, PLAU, PLAUR, SERPINE1,
  TGFB1, and VEGFC in tumor versus normal tissues. (E) Volcano plots showing the fold
  change (FC) and p-value of the biomarker candidates for the comparisons of tumor
  and normal tissues from the GSE138206 dataset. Upregulated (log2FC ≥ 2, p < 0.05)
  and downregulated (log2FC ≤ −2, p < 0.05) genes are depicted in red and green, respectively.
  (F) Expression patterns of PLAUR, PLAU, VEGFC, SERPINE1, ITGA5, and TGFB1 in oral
  squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) tumor (n = 6) and normal (n = 6) tissues visualized
  as heatmaps from the microarray. Data were z-score normalized. (G) Representative
  immunohistochemistry staining images of the ITGA5 and PLAU protein expression levels
  in tumor and normal tissues. Data were from the Human Protein Atlas database.
