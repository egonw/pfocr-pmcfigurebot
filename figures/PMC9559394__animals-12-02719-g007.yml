caption: The supernatant of C. butyricum inhibited the activation of the NF-κB signaling
  pathway induced by E. coli. Western blot was used to measure p-p65 and p-IκB proteins
  in uterine tissues. β-Actin was used as a control. The values presented are the
  means ± SEM (n = 3). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 and **** p < 0.0001 are significantly
  different from ECO group.
