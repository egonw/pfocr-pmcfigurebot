caption: '(A–D) Immunoblots and quantification of different proteins of sphingolipid
  metabolic pathway in BT-474 and MDA-MB-231 cells along with representative βactin
  as control. Protein expression was normalized with representative β-actin as control.
  Details of all Immunoblots with originals are provided in . Data are presented as
  mean ± SEM of at least three independent replicates, and were analyzed by unpaired
  student’s t-test. p-value: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.'
