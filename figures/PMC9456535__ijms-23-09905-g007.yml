caption: 'FtcR binds to the promoters of betI in vivo and in vitro: (A) FtcR-enriched
  sequence reads located within the promoter regions of betI, with annotated genes
  shown at the bottom—ChIP1 and ChIP2—from two independent experimental replicates.
  Scale bar: 1 kb. (B) EMSA for FtcR binding to the TGTGGGCA motif in the betI promoters’
  fragments, labeled by biotin. (C) Specificity and competition assays. The TGTGGGCA
  motif was mutated into TGTCCTTG to test for sequence specificity. The unlabeled
  cold betI promoter region was tested for competition with biotin-labeled betI promoter.
  The unlabeled cold betI promoter region inhibited the binding of FtcR to the labeled
  promoter. The symbols “−” and “+” indicate the absence and presence, respectively,
  of the corresponding proteins or probes. Unrelated probes were used as negative
  controls. Results are representative of at least three independent experiments.
  (D) Expression of betI was detected by WB. Protein expression was evaluated by measuring
  the mean gray values of the Western blots using ImageJ. Data represent the mean
  and standard deviation of n = 3 (independent biological replicates). ** p ≤ 0.01,
  unpaired Student’s t-test.'
