caption: Pathway enrichment of differentially expressed proteins in monocytes of PD
  patients at 2 months after sargramostim treatment. (A) Gene ontology (GO)‐term functional
  enrichment by five categories (immune response, biological process, cellular component,
  KEGG, and Reactome) performed using Cytoscape in conjunction with the plug‐in ClueGO.
  (B) Canonical pathway enrichment analysis performed using IPA (Qiagen). Black arrow
  points to the state of canonical pathways illustrated in Figure 1B; orange colour
  (activation), blue colour (inhibition), and grey colour (no activity pattern)
