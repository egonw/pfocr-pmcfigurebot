caption: 'Summarized pathogenesis of Giant Cell Arterits (GCA). Step 1: an undefined
  danger signal activates vascular dendritic cells (DC) that then acquire a mature
  phenotype (CD83+CD80/86+CCR7+MHC-IIhigh) and produce chemokines (CCL18, CCL19, CCL20
  and CCL21), leading to the recruitment of CCR6+CD161+CD4+ T cells. Step 2: CD4+
  T cells are activated by DCs and polarize into Th1 and Th17 cells through the effect
  of IL-12, IL-23, IL-6 and IL-1β, which are produced by activated DC. Th1 and Th17
  lymphocytes release IFN-γ and IL-17, respectively. Step 3: IFN-γ induces the activation
  of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in the media and enables them to produce
  chemokines (CCL2, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11), which trigger the recruitment of additional
  T cells (CD4+ and CD8+) and monocytes. Monocytes differentiate into macrophages
  and merge into multinucleated giant cells, the hallmark of GCA. Step 4: vascular
  remodeling is characterized by the destruction of the internal elastic lamina and
  the proliferation and migration of VSMC into the intima. Macrophages play a key
  role in this process through the release of several factors such as Platelet-Derived
  Growth Factor (PDGF), reactive oxygen species (ROS), Matrix metalloproteinase-9
  (MMP-9), IL-6, IL-1β, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF)
  and TNF-α, which contribute to tissue damage and intimal hyperplasia. Likewise,
  VSMCs and endothelial cells release ET-1, which stimulates VSMC migration and proliferation
  and thus induces intimal hyperplasia. Moreover, macrophages and VSMCs also produce
  vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is responsible for neoangiogenesis
  and promotes a local inflammatory response. A cellular transition from VSMC to a
  myofibroblast phenotype is observed, and the accumulation of these cells in the
  neo-intima leads to vascular occlusion, which is responsible for ischemic complications
  of GCA. (A–E) Mechanisms involved in the maintenance of vascular inflammation. (A):
  Programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL-1) defect on antigen-presenting cell surface leads
  to the persistent activity of T cells and contributes to hyperplasia and neoangiogenesis.
  (B): IL-6, which is a pro-inflammatory cytokine implicated in the GCA pathogenesis,
  impairs Tregs’ function, decreases their frequency and promotes the shift to a Treg
  deficiency in exon 2 of FoxP3 that is prone to producing IL-17. (C): In addition
  to their role in the recruitment of monocytes and vascular remodeling, VSMC differentiate
  into myofibroblasts, which also participate in the maintenance of Th1 and Tc1 polarizations.
  Moreover, myofibroblasts have an important capacity to produce extracellular matrix
  proteins (COL: collagen, FN: fibronectin) that contribute to the rigidification
  of the vascular wall. (D): GM-CSF is produced by CD4 T cells, macrophages, VSMC
  and endothelial cells. GM-CSF-Receptor-α is highly expressed in GCA lesions, and
  an autocrine amplification loop takes place. GM-CSF is involved in cell differentiation,
  vascular inflammation and vascular remodeling. (E): T cells and resident cells of
  the arterial wall, like endothelial cells, communicate via the NOTCH pathway. The
  ligation of Notch 1 to Jagged 1 decreases the polarization Th1/Th17. Otherwise,
  in CD8+Treg cells, aberrant Notch 4 signaling drives the suppression of RAB7A involved
  in the exosomal release of NOX2.'
