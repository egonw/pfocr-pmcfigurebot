caption: LPA activates Gα12/13–Rho–ROCK2 by upregulating LPA4 and LPA6. (a) Activation
  of the Gα12/13 pathway is detected by the serum response factor response element
  (SRF-RE) luciferase reporter gene. (b, c) The expression of ROCK1 and ROCK2 in spinal
  cord neurons were measured by western blotting. Asterisks indicate statistical significance
  (∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01).
