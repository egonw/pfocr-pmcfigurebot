caption: 'Delivery of oxygen (O2) from the outside air into the muscle fibre. In this
  serial system, O2 delivery cannot exceed the capacity of its weakest link. A substantial
  increase in the function of any one “step” alone may not translate into a corresponding
  gain in exercise capacity (V′O2max) if the remaining steps of the pathway do not
  also adapt; this is ultimately how the respiratory system limits exercise tolerance
  in some elite, aerobically trained athletes. However, in contrast, impairment of
  any one single step in the O2 transport chain, occuring in heart, lung and/or peripheral
  vascular disease states, can seriously compromise exercise performance. The oxygen
  uptake (V′O2) can then be viewed as either the product of minute ventilation (V′E)
  and the difference between inspired and expired fractions of O2 (FiO2 – FeO2) or
  the product of cardiac output (CO) and the arterious–venous O2 content difference
  (CaO2 – CvO2) or the product of muscle diffusion (Dm) and the capillary–mitochondrial
  O2 content difference (CcO2 – CmO2). PIO2: inspired O2 partial pressure; DKlungO2:
  diffusive conductance of the lung for O2, where conductance reflects how much movement
  (e.g. flow) is allowed or permitted; PAO2: alveolar O2 partial pressure; PcapO2:
  capillary O2 partial pressure; CaO2: arterial blood O2 content (determined by pulmonary
  gas exchange); VKmuscle: muscle vascular conductance (conductance is the inverse
  of resistance), for example ↑ conductance, ↑ muscle blood flow due to dilation of
  resistance vessels and ↓ conductance, ↓ muscle blood flow due to constriction of
  resistance vessels; Pa: arterial pressure; Pv: venous pressure (the difference or
  gradient between arterial and venous pressure is an important determinant of skeletal
  muscle blood flow); DKmuscleO2: diffusive conductance of the muscle for O2; PcellO2:
  cell O2 partial pressure (the difference or gradient between PcellO2 and PcapO2
  is an important determinant of diffusive O2 flux into the muscle, and therefore
  muscle metabolic and contractile function).'
