caption: The possible antioxidant mechanisms of MR in aging and aging-related diseases.
  [] FGF21. MR may increase the expression of FGF21 by activating GCN2/ATF4/PPARα
  nutrition signaling in liver, thereby improving insulin sensitivity, promoting fat
  oxidation and glucose metabolism in both liver and WAT. Although FGF21 has been
  reported to induce the adiponectin expression and secretion in WAT, the positive
  benefits of glucose metabolism induced by MR may be independent of adiponectin and
  FGF21. Circulating FGF21 released by the liver enters the BBB, regulates AMPK/Akt
  and inhibits NFκB, further attenuating neuroinflammation and oxidative stress [].
  H2S (nanomolar to micromolar concentrations) released by the liver. MR produces
  more H2S by enhancing the CBS/CGL in transsulfuration pathway. On the one hand,
  H2S activates autophagy and inhibits oxidative stress via regulating Sirt1 and mTOR
  in the WAT. On the other hand, H2S increases the GSH and improves mitochondrial
  oxidative damage, including mtROS, DNA/protein oxidation and fatty acids peroxidizability
  in the brain []. Gut microbiome. MR balances the gut microbiome, especially suppresses
  the Desulfovibrionales, a kind of SRB, which could reduce sulfate to produce H2S
  (high micromolar to low millimolar concentrations). Lower H2S decreases the inflammation
  and oxidative stress in the gut. Moreover, gut and gut microbiome/metabolite homeostasis
  affects brain function, which is considered as gut-brain axis. FGF21 = fibroblast
  growth factor 21, WAT = white adipose tissue, BBB = blood brain barrier, CBS = cystathionine-β-synthase,
  CGL = cystathionine-γ-lyase, H2S = hydrogen sulfide, GSH = glutathione, mtROS = mitochondrial
  ROS, SRB = sulfate-reducing bacteria, CAT = catalase, SOD = superoxide dismutase,
  GPx = glutathione peroxidase, MPO = myeloperoxidase.
