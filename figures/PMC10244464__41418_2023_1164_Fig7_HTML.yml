figure_title: Ubiquitinated p62 by TRAF2 promotes mTOR activation
caption: A Cell proliferation was evaluated by ATPlite growth assay for 5 days (**P < 0.01,
  n = 3, two-way repeated-measures ANOVA analysis). B, C, D Ubiquitinated p62 promotes
  HCC cell proliferation compared to K420R mutants, tumor volumes, and weight were
  measured (*p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001, n = 5, C two-way repeated-measures ANOVA analysis;
  D Student’s t test, mean ± SEM). E Representative immunohistochemistry images(left).
  IHC score of indicated protein (right, ***p < 0.001, n = 5, Student’s t test, mean ± SEM).
  Scale bar = 50 μm. F mTORC1 activity was analyzed in Huh7 cell, following IBs with
  indicated Abs. G The interaction of ubiquitinated p62 with Raptor and RagC. H Confocal
  microscopy showing the colocalization of LAMP2 and mTOR in p62-deletion Huh7 cells.
  Scale bar = 5 μm. I A model for TRAF2 in liver tumorigenesis.
article_title: The TRAF2-p62 axis promotes proliferation and survival of liver cancer
  by activating mTORC1 pathway.
