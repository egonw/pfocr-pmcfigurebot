caption: 'BAMBI or SMAD6 silencing mimics the osteogenic roles of miR-20a in MC3T3-E1
  cells. (A) Silencing efficiency was measured with qRT-PCR after MC3T3-E1 cells had
  been transfected with siRNAs targeting BAMBI or SMAD6, respectively. (B) ALP activity
  was enhanced by si-BAMBI, si-SMAD6, and miR-20a, respectively. (C) BMP2, RUNX2,
  and SP7 mRNA expressions were induced by si-BAMBI, si-SMAD6, and miR-20a, respectively.
  (D) Alizarin red S staining assay was conducted after the cells had been transfected
  with si-BAMBI, si-SMAD6, and miR-20a. Scale bar: 50 µm. Data are shown as mean ±
  SD for n=3; *, &, #, P<0.05; **, &&, ##, P<0.01; ***, ###, P<0.001 vs. NC. qRT-PCR,
  real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; BAMBI,
  BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor; SMAD6, mothers against decapentaplegic
  family member 6; si-BAMBI, silencing of BAMBI; si-SMAD6, silencing of SMAD6; NC,
  negative control group.'
