caption: 'Effects of HIF-1α activators and inhibitors on the TEER (A), FD-4 concentration
  (B), and the expression of HIF-1α (C, D) and TJ-related proteins (C, E-G) in the
  Caco-2 cell epithelial model after LPS stimulation. LPS-induced damage to Caco-2
  cell epithelial model showed the decrease of TEER value, the increase of FD4 concentration
  and down-regulation of TJ-related proteins. DMOG, the HIF-1α activator, alleviated
  the LPS-induced damage to Caco-2 cell epithelial model, increased TEER value, decreased
  FD4 concentration and up-regulated the expression of TJ-related proteins. BAY 87-2243,
  a HIF-1α inhibitor, had the opposite effect. LPS up-regulated HIF-1α expression,
  DMOG further up-regulated HIF-1α expression, while BAY 87-2243 had the opposite
  effect Con: control group, LPS: LPS group, L + D: LPS + DMOG group, L + B: LPS + BAY
