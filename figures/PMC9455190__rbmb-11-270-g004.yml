caption: Inhibiting PLC, PI3K pathway reduced FA disassembly time of MDA-MB231cells.
  A) Confocal live imaging showing vinculin turnover over time. The red arrow shows
  dynamic FAs. MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with GFP-vinculin for 24 h, then
  treated with U73122 and LY204002 inhibitors and incubated for 30 min. Treatment
  with U73343/LY303511 were used as a control. B) Statistical analysis of FA turnover
  rates was determined from 40 FAs, in 20 migrating MDA-MB-231. Cells treated with
  the inhibitors showed that FA disassembly rate was decreased significantly. C) Cell
  migration was significantly inhibited, compared to cells treated with the negative
  controls’ analogues. Time-lapse microscopy was used to track cell migration for
  24 hours. MTrackJ was used to measure cell migration. Statistical analysis was performed
  using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's test for multiple comparison. Statistical significance
  was accepted at ***p< 0.0005. Data represents mean±SD of the three independent experiments.
