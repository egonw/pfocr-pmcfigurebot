figure_title: Figure 5. Hypothetical biosynthetic pathway of marasmin in T. violacea
  analogous to that of alliin in garlic. The previously proposed biosynthetic pathway
  for the major natural form of alliin [(RCSS)-S-allylcysteine sulfoxide] in garlic
  (above) and the hypothetical biosynthetic pathway for the natural form of marasmin
  [(RCRS)-S-(methylthiomethyl)cysteine-4-oxide] in T. violacea (below). In the last
  step, both pathways include the S-oxygenation of the sulfide biosynthetic intermediate,
  catalyzed by a specific FMO
