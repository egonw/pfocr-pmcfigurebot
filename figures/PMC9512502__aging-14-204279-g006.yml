caption: Down-regulation of RON inhibits tumorigenesis in vivo and reduces CXCR4 expression
  in vivo. Representative images of xenograft tumor formation were shown in the LV–shRON
  group and LV–shNC group in nude mice. RON knockdown reduced the tumor volume and
  tumour weight in nude mice. The tumor volume growth curve was significantly inhibited
  in the LV–shRON group (A), and the average tumor weights were markedly lower, as
  compared with those in the LV–shNC group (B), Furthermore, the CXCR4, E-cadherin
  and Vimentin proteins expression was significantly decreased or increased compared
  with controls (C). All data are shown as means ± SEM, **P < 0.01 versus scramble.
