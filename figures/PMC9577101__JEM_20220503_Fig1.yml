caption: 'TCF7/Tcf7 is prevalent in CD4+T cells in human and mouse PDA. (A) Dot plot
  of WNT pathway genes in all identified cell populations in hPDA (n = 16). (B) Violin
  plot of TCF7 in each cell population in hPDA. (C) Immunostaining for TCF1 (green),
  CD4 (red), CD8 (magenta) in human PDA. DAPI nuclear staining is in blue. Full arrows:
  TCF1 expressing CD4+ T cells. Empty arrows: TCF1 expressing CD8+ T cells. (D) Dot
  plot of WNT pathway genes in all identified cell populations in mPDA. (E) Violin
  plot of Tcf7 in all the identified cell populations in healthy mouse pancreas and
  mPDA. (F) Dot plot of Tcf7 in all the identified cell populations in healthy mouse
  pancreas and mPDA. iCAF, inflammatory cancer associated fibroblasts; myCAF, myofibroblastic
  cancer associated fibroblasts; apCAF, antigen-presenting cancer associated fibroblasts.'
