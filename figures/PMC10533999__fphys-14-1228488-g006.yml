caption: AngII stimulation increased phosphorylation of the Ca2+ dependent tyrosine
  kinase, Pyk2 and of its downstream targets PDK1 and RSK2 which was suppressed by
  Pyk2 inhibitor, PF-4618433. (A) Representative Western blot and graphs from cultured
  E18.5 aortic SM cells showing significant AngII-induced phosphorylation of both
  Pyk2 (n = 8 biological replicates, p < 0.001) and PDK1 (n = 7 biological replicates,
  p < 0.01). The Pyk2 inhibitor, (PF-4618433), inhibited activation of both Pyk2 and
  its downstream target, PDK1 (n = 8, p < 0.001 and n = 7, p < 0.01 respectively).
  (B) AngII increased RSK2 phosphorylation (n = 5, p < 0.05) that was significantly
  inhibited by PF-4618433 (n = 5, p < 0.01). Proteins normalized to actin. (C) Three
  signaling pathways regulating SM RLC20 phosphorylation, contractility, basal tone
  and regulation of blood pressure. Agonists, neurotransmitters or increases in arterial
  intraluminal pressure activate; 1) the canonical Ca2+ activated MLCK pathway. 2)
  the RhoA/ROCK pathway that phosphorylates and inhibits MLCP resulting in an increase
  in RLC20 phosphorylation. 3) the new RSK2 pathway that leads to activation of NHE-1
  resulting in cytosolic alkalinization and increase in Ca2+ events. This increased
  Ca2+ in addition to Ca2+influx and release from stores, feeds back to further activated
  the MLCK pathway. Activated RSK2 can also directly phosphorylate RLC20. Different
  stimuli may preferentially select for a given signaling pathway. Created by BioRender.com.
