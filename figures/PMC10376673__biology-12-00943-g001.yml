caption: Respiratory virus activation of the inflammasome. (1) Once respiratory viruses
  enter the airways, (2) they encounter respiratory epithelial cells and resident
  immune cells, such as alveolar macrophages. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns
  expressed by the virus are recognized by innate sensors and activate the innate
  immune system. (3) Through TLR receptors, the NF-kB pathway is activated, leading
  to the up-regulation of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β, which results in the inflammasome complex
  activation after its binding to ASC. Then, caspase-1 is cleaved and activated, which
  leads to the cleavage of pro-IL-1β and gasdermin D (GSDMD). Cleaved GSDMD (N-GSDMD)
  forms membrane pores and IL-1 β is released. The inflammasome can also be activated
  through cGAS and RIG-1 receptors, which recognize viral DNA and viral RNA, respectively.
  (4) Outcomes of inflammasome activation include inflammasome inhibition by the virus,
  which can easily replicate and spread, resulting in worse disease prognosis of the
  host. When the inflammasome is properly activated, IL-1 β production and the activation
  of the immune system help resolve the infection and restore lung homeostasis. Hyperactivation
  of the inflammasome leads to excessive inflammation and a cytokine storm, contributing
  to lung immunopathology, tissue damage, and worse disease prognosis. Figure created
