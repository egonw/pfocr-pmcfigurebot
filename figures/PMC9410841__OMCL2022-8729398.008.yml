caption: 'Overexpression of TXNIP reversed the beneficial effects of COG1410 on M2
  microglial polarization and apoptosis at 72 h after cerebral I/R. (a–c) TXNIP-overexpression
  efficacy evaluation. Data were represented as mean ± SEM (n = 6). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P
  < 0.01 vs. naive group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 vs. AAV-NC group. (e) Representative
  bands of Western blot data. (d, f–o) Quantitative analysis of the Western blot bands.
  Data were represented as the mean ± SEM (n = 6). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. sham
  group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 vs. I/R + Vehicle group; $P < 0.05, $$P < 0.01 vs.
  I/R + COG1410 + AAV-NC group.'
