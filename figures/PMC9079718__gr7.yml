caption: 'MG53 combined with hUC-MSCs transplantation enhances neurogenesis in the
  brain of AD mice. (A) Representative immunofluorescence images of EdU/DCX, EdU/NeuN,
  and EdU/Nestin double staining. Scale bar = 100 μm. (B-D) Quantification analysis
  of EdU+/DCX+ cells, EdU+/NeuN+ cells, and EdU+/Nestin+ cells. Cell nuclear (blue)
  was labeled by DAPI. Data were presented as mean ± SEM. N = 3 per group. Compared
  with the AD group, P < 0.05; #: Compared with the MSCs group, P < 0.05. (For interpretation
  of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
  Web version of this article.)'
article_title: MG53 protein rejuvenates hUC-MSCs and facilitates their therapeutic
  effects in AD mice by activating Nrf2 signaling pathway.
