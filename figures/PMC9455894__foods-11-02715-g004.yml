caption: 'Different nutritional conditions effect on the genes involving in condition
  of A. cinnamomea. (A): changes in the expression of genes related to asexual sporulation
  signal pathway mediated by A. cinnamomea FluG; (B): changes in the expression of
  other genes related to asexual sporulation of A. cinnamomea matched with the local
  protein database; A. cinnamomea 18S rRNA gene was taken as the internal reference,
  and mycelium of control group was taken as CK.'
