caption: Anlo elevated the expression of PDL1 in vivo and in vitro. (a) PDL1 mRNA
  expression was elevated after anlo treatment (2.5 μM/mL) in MC38 and CT26 cells.
  (b) PDL1 protein expression was elevated after anlo treatment (2.5 μM/mL, 5 μM/mL)
  in MC38 and CT26 cells. (c) Gating strategy of flow analysis. (d) The percentage
  of PDL1 in CD45 cells of both MC38 and CT26 cell line tumor-bearing mouse models
  after anlo treatment. (e) Immunohistochemistry results of PDL1 in MC38 and CT26
  tumor-bearing mice after anlo treatment; the red arrows represent the positive expression
  of PDL1 protein of both MC38 and CT26 tumors.
