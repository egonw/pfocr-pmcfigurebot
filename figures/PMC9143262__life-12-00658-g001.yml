caption: Pulmonary arterial hypertension-associated vascular remodeling. Pulmonary
  arterioles are mostly non muscularized at basal state. They are in close proximity
  with PDGFRβ+ pericytes, PDGFRα+ progenitor cells and fibroblasts. In the course
  of the disease, the small arterioles are covered with new smooth muscle cells formed
  from smooth muscles cells, pericytes and PDGFRα+ progenitor cells. The media of
  muscularized arteries thickens and myofibroblasts proliferate and migrate forming
  a neointima. Fibroblasts and immune cells accumulate in the perivascular zone.
