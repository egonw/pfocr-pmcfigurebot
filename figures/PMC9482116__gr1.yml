caption: The activation of NFAT signaling pathway in DCs induce efficient T cell activation
  and graft rejection(A) Kaplan-Meier curve showing the percentage of WT recipients
  mice undergoing graft acceptance. WT females were transplanted with the skin of
  donor WT females or WT or NFATC2-deficient males; graft acceptance and rejection
  were monitored at the indicated time points until day 90 after transplantations.
  Long-rank (Mantel–Cox) statistical analysis was performed. ∗∗p < 0.001.(B) Kaplan-Meier
  curve showing the percentage of WT recipients undergoing graft acceptance. Recipient
  WT females were transplanted with DC-deficient or sufficient male skin or with female
  skin as control; graft acceptance and rejection were monitored at the indicated
  time points until day 80 after transplant. Long-rank (Mantel–Cox) statistical analysis
  was performed, ∗p < 0.05.(C) IFN-γ expression in skin grafts was measured 3 days
  after transplantation by qPCR. Fold changes (FC) in male over female skin grafts
  are shown both for WT and NFATc2-deficient skins. Values represent the mean +SE
  from 6 mice for each group. Statistical significance was determined with one-way
  analysis of variance, followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test, ∗p< 0.05, ns
  not statistically significant.(D) IFN-γ production by alloreactive T cells stimulated
  with WT or NFATc2-deficient DCs after 5 days of coculture. DCs were activated or
  not with LPS (1 μg/mL). Values represent the mean + SD of three independent experiments.
  Statistical significance was determined with one-way analysis of variance, followed
  by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test, ∗p< 0.05, ∗∗p< 0.001.(E) Efficiency of migration
  to draining lymph nodes of NFATC2-deficient and WT DCs measured by FITC painting.
  Values represent the absolute number of CD11c+MHCII+ FITC+ DCs from three independent
  experiments. Statistical significance was determined with student’s t test, ∗∗p<
  0.001.
