caption: 'Depression activates FAK and induces an aligned desmoplastic ECM in Hi-myc
  mice. a PTK2 mRNA assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in
  the prostate, relative to control group (n = 6). The statistical analysis was based
  on One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc tests (***P < 0.001). b Immunohistochemistry
  staining of FAK in the prostate. Bar: 50 µm. c Left: Western blot analysis of pY397
  FAK and FAK in the prostate; Right: Quantification of FAK band intensity relative
  to GAPDH, and pY397 FAK band intensity relative to total FAK (n = 6). The results
  were representative of two independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, based
  on One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc tests. d MMP9 and MMP2 mRNA assessed by qRT-PCR
  in the prostate, relative to control group (n = 6). The statistical analysis was
  based on One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc tests (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P
  < 0.001). e Zymography for gelatinase activities in the prostate (n = 3). The results
  were representative of three independent experiments. f Masson staining of the prostate
  (n = 3). Bar: 50 µm. g Connective tissue growth factor (ctgf) mRNA assessed by qRT-PCR
  in the prostate, relative to control group (n = 6). The statistical analysis was
  based on One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc tests (**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001). h
  Transgenic growth factor beta 1 (tgfb1) mRNA assessed by qRT-PCR in the prostate,
  relative to control group (n = 6). The statistical analysis was based on One-way
  ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc tests (**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001). i Immunofluorescence
  staining of NF-L in the prostate. Bar: 50 µm'
