caption: Description of the reaction pathways and experimental approach. (A) Illustration
  of the H-cluster with the bridgehead atom is highlighted as a red X and can be NH
  in the ADT variant and CH2 in the PDT variant. (B) Schematic describing the proposed
  pathways from Hox to Hred (Hred′). (C) Schematic of the overall ET pathway from
  photosensitizer to mediator to enzyme catalyst. R-SH = the sacrificial electron
  donor (SED), mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), and RSSR = oxidized SED 3,3′-dithiodipropionic
  acid.
