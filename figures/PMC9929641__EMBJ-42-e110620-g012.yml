caption: Relative mRNA expression levels of IDH2, EGLN1, Hif‐1α, G6PD, TIGAR, TKT,
  and CTPS1 between J82 wild‐type cells (J82WT) and J82 cells with IDH2 overexpression
  (J82‐IDH2ox cells). The data are shown as the mean values ± SEs (n = 3, biological
  replicates). The expression levels were analyzed by Student's t‐test and are plotted
  relative to the expression levels in WT cells. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.Western
  blot analysis of IDH2, PHD2, Hif‐1α, G6PD, TIGAR, TKT, CTPS1, and β‐actin in J82WT
  and J82‐IDH2ox cells.Hierarchical clustering of significantly regulated metabolites
  in J82WT and J82‐IDH2ox cells (n = 3, biological replicates each).Levels of intermediate
  metabolites of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle based on targeted CE‐MS/MS metabolomics
  in GR cells relative to WT cells. The data are shown as the mean values ± SDs (n = 3,
  biological replicates) and were analyzed by Student's t‐test. *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001.Relative
  2‐HG production level based on targeted CE‐MS metabolomics in J82‐IDH2ox cells compared
  with WT cells. The data are shown as the mean values ± SDs (n = 3, biological replicates)
  and were analyzed by Student's t‐test. ***P < 0.001. 13C enrichment in cellular
  α‐KG, as determined by CE‐MS and normalized to the total pool size of the corresponding
  metabolite. The data are shown as the mean values ± SDs (n = 3, biological replicates)
  and were analyzed by Student's t‐test. **P < 0.01. 13C enrichment in cellular malate
  determined by CE‐MS and normalized to the total pool size of the corresponding metabolite.
  The data are shown as the mean values ± SDs (n = 3, biological replicates) and were
  analyzed by Student's t‐test. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.Major metabolites in the
  glycolytic pathway altered in J82‐IDH2ox cells compared with WT cells. The data
  are shown as the mean values ± SDs (n = 3, biological replicates) and were analyzed
  by Student's t‐test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.PPP metabolite levels in
  J82‐IDH2ox cells compared with WT cells based on targeted CE‐MS metabolomics. The
  data are shown as the mean values ± SDs (n = 3, biological replicates) and were
  analyzed by Student's t‐test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.Relative dATP,
  dTTP, and dCTP level based on targeted CE‐MS metabolomics in J82‐IDH2ox cells compared
  with WT cells. The data are shown as the mean values ± SDs (n = 3, biological replicates)
  and were analyzed by Student's t‐test. **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001. N.D., non‐detectable.Graph
  showing the viability of J82WT and J82‐IDH2ox cells exposed to various concentrations
  of GEM for 48 h. The data are shown as the mean values ± SDs (n = 3, biological
  replicates) and were analyzed by Student's t‐test. ***P < 0.001.  Source data are
  available online for this figure.
