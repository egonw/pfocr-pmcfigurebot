caption: HDAC6 is a H2S-related pro-inflammatory factor in rRAFLS. The gene expression
  of (A) CSE, (B) HDAC6, (C) COX2, and (D) IL-1β in rRAFLS transfected with scrambled
  (Scr) or targeting CSE (si-CSE) siRNA for 6 h. (E) Cells in control (Crtl) group
  and NaHS (20, 100, 500 μM) groups were collected after 6 h treatment and then subjected
  to qRT-PCR. (F,G) Cells were pre-treated with NaHS (20, 100, 500 μM) and tubA (0.1
  μM) for 1 h and then stimulated with LPS (100 ng/mL) for another 5 h. Then, the
  cells were subjected to qRT-PCR. (H,I) Cells were transfected with vector (Vec)
  or HDAC6 overexpression plasmid for 6 h and treated with NaHS (100 μM) and tubA
  (0.1 μM) for another 6 h. Then, the cells were subjected to qRT-PCR. Bars indicate
  the mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001. n = 3–4 in each group.
