caption: Autophagy-induced inhibition of inflammation is via p38 MAPK/mTOR signaling
  pathway. (a) is the representative images of Western blot; (b and c) are quantitative
  diagrams of expression levels of LC3 and p62; (dâ€“f) are quantitative diagrams of
  expression levels of p-p38 MAPK, p-ULK1, and p-mTOR, respectively. n=5, *p<0.05,
  **p<0.01.
