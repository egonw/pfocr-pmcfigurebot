caption: 'AKIP1 binds to Rac1 in ccRCC cells and its downregulation inhibits the Rac1
  expression. The (A) mRNA and (B) protein expression of Rac1 in ccRCC cell lines
  and normal renal epithelial cell lines were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR and western blotting. ***P<0.001 vs. HKC-5 group. The interaction of (C) AKIP1
  and (D) Rac1 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assay. ***P<0.001 vs. input
  group; ###P<0.001 vs. IgG group. (E) The expression of Rac1 in Caki-1 cells transfected
  with siRNA-AKIP1 was detected by western blotting. (F) The expression of AKIP1 in
  Caki-1 cells transfected with siRNA-AKIP1 was detected by western blotting. ***P<0.001
  vs. control group; ###P<0.001 vs. siRNA-NC group. ccRCC, clear cell renal cell carcinoma;
  AKIP1, a-kinase interaction protein 1; siRNA, small interfering RNA; NC, negative
  control.'
article_title: A-kinase interacting protein 1 regulates the cell proliferation, invasion,
  migration and angiogenesis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma cells and affects
  the ERK/c-Myc signaling pathway by binding to Rac1.
