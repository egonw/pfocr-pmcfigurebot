caption: Analysis of RNA‐seq data. (a) Summary of analysis scheme for RNA‐seq data.
  (b) Volcano plot of RNA‐seq data showing the differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
  between red and green leaf lettuce cultivars. Red and green dots indicate up‐regulated
  and down‐regulated DEGs, respectively (p < 0.05, log2 fold change >1). (c) Mapping
  of expression profiles onto the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway in leaf lettuce.
  Each colored box shows the average log2 (TPM + 1) values of a biosynthetic pathway
  gene, according to the color scale. Genes selected as anthocyanin biosynthesis highly
  associated genes are indicated with asterisks (also indicated in Figure ). Branched
  pathways for biosynthesis of chlorogenic acid (blue arrows), chicoric acid (green
  arrows), and quercetin glucosides (orange arrows) are indicated.
