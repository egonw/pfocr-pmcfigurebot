caption: hsa-miR-340-3p inhibits the proliferation of PCs in vitro. a-b Flow cytometry
  analysis was applied to detect cell apoptosis for two cell lines transfected with
  corelated plasmids. b revealed quantification of the data shown in a. c-d EdU incorporation
  assay was performed to detect the proliferation of PANC-1 (c) and CFPAC-1 (d). e-f
  Quantification of the data shown in c and d. g-h CCK8 was performed to evaluate
  the cell viability of PANC-1 (g) and CFPAC-1 (h). Each experiment was performed
  three times independently and results are presented as mean Â± s.d. Student's t-test
  was used to analyze the data. (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001)
article_title: HTR1D functions as a key target of HOXA10-AS/miR-340-3p axis to promote
  the malignant outcome of pancreatic cancer via PI3K-AKT signaling pathway.
