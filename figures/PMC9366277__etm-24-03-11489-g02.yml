caption: 'AKIP1 knockdown inhibits the invasion and migration of ccRCC cells. (A)
  The invasion (magnification, x100) and (B) migration of Caki-1 cells transfected
  with siRNA-AKIP1 were determined by Transwell and wound healing assays (magnification,
  x200). (C) The expression of metastasis-related proteins in Caki-1 cells transfected
  with siRNA-AKIP1 was detected by western blotting. ***P<0.001 vs. control group;
  ###P<0.001 vs. siRNA-NC group. ccRCC, clear cell renal cell carcinoma; AKIP1, a-kinase
  interaction protein 1; siRNA, small interfering RNA; NC, negative control.'
article_title: A-kinase interacting protein 1 regulates the cell proliferation, invasion,
  migration and angiogenesis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma cells and affects
  the ERK/c-Myc signaling pathway by binding to Rac1.
