caption: Graphical representation of the TrkB signaling pathway at the NMJ. (A) EOM
  in comparison with SOL. EOM muscles share several molecular features with SOL, represented
  in pale blue. However, they also have some unique features (dark blue), whose relationship
  with SOL is indicated by arrows (↑ for increase and ↓ for decrease). These characteristics
  are possibly involved in the ability of EOM to contract fast without being fatigued
  despite continuous usage. (B) The different limb muscles. Limb muscles share a few
  molecular features (pale gray). Also, the TA muscle has some unique features (orange).
  On the other hand, SOL’s unique features are always coincident with EOM (pale blue;
  like in panel A). Finally, some proteins equally change in SOL and TA in relation
  to EDL (dark green). Thus, two levels of adaptations to resistance to fatigue can
  be spotted depending on if they are exclusive of SOL or shared with TA. Finally,
  TA also shows some characteristics that could be involved in the differences between
  flexor and extensor muscles as they are different from SOL and EDL (pale green).
  The BDNF/TrkB downstream signaling is always the same at the NMJ, but the different
  proportions of proteins allow the adaptation to the precise requirements of each
  muscle and vice versa. In brief, proBDNF preferentially binds p75NTR while mBDNF
  and NT-4 selectively bind and activate either full length or truncated TrkB. When
  TrkB.FL is not inhibited by heterodimerization with truncated isoforms, it activates
  PKCs in the membrane, which has been previously phosphorylated by PDK1. This is
  mediated by PLCγ, which enhances intracellular Ca2+ and DAG concentration. At the
  plasma membrane, PKCs modulate ACh release by phosphorylating exocytotic machinery
  proteins such as Munc18-1 and SNAP-25. Furthermore, SNAP-25 is also phosphorylated
  by PKA, whose activity depends on muscarinic ACh receptors, among others.
