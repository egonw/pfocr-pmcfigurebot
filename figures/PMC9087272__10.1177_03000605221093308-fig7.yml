caption: 'Piperlongumine (PL) and vitamin C (VC) synergistically induced apoptosis
  in two gastric cancer cell lines in vitro: (a) AGS and KATO III cells were treated
  with PL (5, 10 µM) and VC (1 mM) alone or in combination for 48 h and then stained
  with annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) for the flow cytometric analysis of the levels
  of apoptosis; (b) the proportion of cells that were apoptotic after treatment. Data
  presented as mean ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001; ns, not significant;
  analysis of variance. The colour version of this figure is available at: http://imr.sagepub.com.'
