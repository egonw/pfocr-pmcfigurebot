caption: Tumor-secreted IFI35 promotes CD8+ T cells proliferation. A ELISA analysis
  in the supernatant of IFI35 overexpressed or knocked down CT26 and MC38 cells. B–G
  Effect of IFI35 protein on T cell migration, apoptosis and proliferation in vitro.
  T cell migration, apoptosis and proliferation in the presence of supernatant from
  murine colon cancer cells expressing shRNA against IFI35 (shIFI35) and scrambled
  sequence control (shRNA) for 72 h. In all experiments, mouse splenic CD8+ T cells
  were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3/CD28 mAbs. B, C Migration of CD8+ T cells
  by flow cytometric analysis. D, E Flow cytometric analysis of mouse splenic CD8+
  T cells apoptosis. F, G Proliferation of CFSE-labeled mouse splenic CD8+ T cells
  by flow cytometric analysis. n = 3. Error bars represent the mean ± SEM. Two tailed
  t-tests, ns not significant. ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. H, I Effect of IFI35
  on T cell proliferation in vivo. H Gating strategy for Ki67+ CD8+ T cells in CT26
  tumors. I Quantification of Ki67 expression among CD8+ T cells in CT26 tumors. n = 4
  for both groups. Two tailed t-tests. **P < 0.01
