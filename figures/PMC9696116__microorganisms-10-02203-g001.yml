caption: Phylogenic analysis of MJM60668. Phylogenetic analysis was performed by the
  neighbor-joining method, using MEGA11 software. Numbers on the branches represent
  the bootstrap values (%) from 1000 replicates. The evolutionary distances were computed
  using the Kimura 2-parameter method. The scale bar indicates substitutions of 0.002
  per nucleotide position.
