caption: A40926 complex and its related fatty acyl side‐chain.A. HPLC analysis of
  A40926 components in fermentation extracts of Nonomuraea gerenzanensis L70. The
  numbered peaks represent eight components of A40926 that were confirmed by LC‐MS
  data and ultraviolet (UV) absorption as shown in Fig. .B. Chemical structures of
  A40926 complex. The acyl group was shown as FA (fatty acyl). Structures of FA moieties
  in the A40926 complex are shown with the corresponding marked numbers in HPLC analysis.C.
  Partial metabolic pathway in N. gerenzanensis L70. Solid arrow denotes the direct
  reaction and the dotted arrow denotes the indirect reaction.
