caption: CpG islands exist ubiquitously throughout the genome, often upstream of gene
  promoter elements. Methylation of CpG islands is typically associated with repression
  of downstream gene transcription. Cytosine residues in these CpG islands are often
  methylated by DNMT3A/3L and DNMT3B/3L complexes, whereas DNMT1 functions mainly
  to maintain 5-mC of hemi-methylated DNA during replication. DNMTs require the universal
  methyl donor SAM. DNA demethylation requires the coordinated action of TET enzymes
  with TDG and the base excision repair pathway, generating 5-hydroxymethylcytosine,
  (5-hmC), 5-fluorocytosine (5-fC), and 5-carboxylcytosine (5-caC) intermediates during
  the process. TETs require oxygen and α-ketoglutarate (αKG) as reaction substrates.
