caption: 'eIF3a suppression significantly reduced irinotecan‐induced cell apoptosis.
  (A–D) The eIF3a silencing and control Caco2 (A) and HT29 (C) cells were exposed
  to irinotecan for 48 h and then subjected to flow cytometry assay. Three independent
  experiments were conducted, and statistical results were presented (B, D). (E) The
  eIF3a silencing and control Caco2 and HT29 cells were exposed to irinotecan for
  48 h and proteins were extracted for western blot assay. Key proteins in the apoptosis
  pathway were detected. (F,G) The statistical results of the western blot assay shown
  in Figure , which were calculated from three independent experiments. (H–K) eIF3a
  was silenced in HT29 and CACO2 cells. Then cells were exposed to irinotecan for
  48 h and TUNEL assays were conducted to detect irinotecan‐induced apoptosis in HT29
  (H, I) and Caco2 (J, K) cells. Hoechst staining was used to label cell nucleus.
  Representative images (H, J) were exhibited. Figure I, K showed the percentage of
  positive cells statistically analysed from three independent experiments. Iri: irinotecan'
