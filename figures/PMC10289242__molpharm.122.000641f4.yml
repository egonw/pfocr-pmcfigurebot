caption: PREPL knockdown downregulates proteins related to protein processing and
  secretion and modulates agonist-induced G-protein–coupled receptor endocytosis.
  (A and B) Representative western blots (originals in Supplemental Fig. 4) and quantification
  showing that two different shPREPL constructs (shPREPL A and shPREPL D) cause a
  decrease in PC1 (A) and PC2 (A) levels in N2A and HT22 cells and that PREPL expression
  in knockdown cells rescues wild-type phenotype. One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple
  comparison test; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001, ns = not significant. (C
  and D) Whole-cell ELISA showing that knockdown of PREPL (shPREPL) in either N2A
  (C) or HT22 (D) cells decreases the levels of PC1, PC2, and VGF-derived peptide
  AQEE. Welch’s t test; **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. (E) Levels of the
  secreted VGF-derived peptide AQEE were measured by ELISA using N2A APP control and
  N2A APP shPREPL cells under depolarizing (Depol) and nondepolarizing (non-depol)
  conditions. Each dot represents a biologic replicate. Welch’s t test; *P < 0.05,
  ****P < 0.0001. (F and G) The internalization of the delta opioid receptor (DOR)
  (F and G) was measured by ELISA using N2A wild-type and N2A shPREPL cells treated
  with 1 μM deltorphin II (for DOR) for 0–120 minutes. (G) Percentage of cell surface
  receptors after 2-hour treatment with deltorphin II is shown. (H and I) The internalization
  of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) was measured by ELISA using HT22 wild-type
  and HT22 shPREPL cells treated with 100 nM of HU210 for 0–120 minutes. (I) Percentage
  of cell surface receptors after 1-hour treatment with HU210 is shown. Data represent
  mean ± S.D. (n = 3). Two-way ANOVA was used to compare the cell surface receptor
  expression between control and PREPL KD cells at different time points; *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.005.
