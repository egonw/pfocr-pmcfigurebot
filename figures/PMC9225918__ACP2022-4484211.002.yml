caption: Anlotinib combined with 5-FU induces cell apoptosis in the H446 cells. The
  cells were treated with anlotinib and 5-FU or combination of both for 24 hours.
  Apoptosis determined by annexin V-FITC/PI staining by flow cytometry. (a) The H446
  cells were treated with anlotinib (5 μM) and 5-FU (10 μM) or combination of both.
  (b) The apoptosis rate (%) included Q3 and Q4. All experiments were repeated three
  times. The bars represent mean ± SEM of the three independent experiments. ∗P <
  0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 compared with anlotinib.
