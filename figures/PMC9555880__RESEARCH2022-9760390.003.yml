caption: scRNA-seq analysis profiling reveals cell heterogeneity in tissues. (a) t-SNE
  plot of single-cell samples profiled. Muscle cluster (green circle), MTP cluster
  (blue circle), and tendon cluster (red circle). (b) Violin plots show the expression
  distributions of specific marker genes across sub-cluster. Clusters are represented
  by different colors. (c) Heatmap shows the expression pattern of top 50 differential
  genes in each cluster. Differential genes of each cluster are listed in Supplementary
  table. (d) The myogenesis signaling pathway and tendon-related gene in MTJ cluster
  compared with muscle or tendon cluster by GSEA signaling pathway analysis. (e) Schematic
  diagram of H&E staining for MTJ. Yellow arrows represent MTP. (f) H&E staining of
  muscle, tendon, and MTP in mouse MTP (top, scale bar = 50 μm; bottom, scale bar
  = 20 μm). Yellow arrows represent MTP. (g) Immunofluorescence staining for tendon
  cells (COL14, green) and muscle cells (ASB5, red) in human MTP; scale bar, 50 μm.
  Yellow arrows represent MTP. (h) Immunofluorescence staining for tendon cells (THBS4,
  green) and muscle cells (TNNT1, red) in mouse MTP; scale bar, 50 μm. Yellow arrows
  represent MTP.
