caption: 'TGF-β signalling pathways. TGF-β is a central mediator of fibrosis. Canonical
  signalling via SMAD family proteins can initiate downstream gene expression or repression.
  Noncanonical signalling can occur via a number of pathways, which can lead to a
  diverse array of outcomes dependent upon context. A cell''s phenotypic response
  to TGF ligands is dependent on the balance of signalling proteins and pathway interactions.
  SBE: SMAD-binding element; TBE: transcription factor binding element; TF: transcription
  factor; P: Phosphorylation; TGF: transforming growth factor; BMP: bone morphogenetic
  proteins; JNK: c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ERK: extracellular-signal-regulated kinase;
  p38: p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K: phosphoinositide 3-kinase; JAK/STAT:
  Jak family tyrosine kinases/signal transducer and activator of transcription; ROCK:
  Rho-associated protein kinase. Figure was created with BioRender.com.'
