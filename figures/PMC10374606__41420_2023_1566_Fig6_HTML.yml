figure_title: Effect of LiCl and SC79 pretreatment on PI3K/Akt/Gsk3β signaling pathway
  and apoptosis related protein expression in Prx II knockdown HaCaT cells
caption: A–D Analysis of expression levels of p-PI3K/PI3K, p-Akt/Akt and p-Gsk3β/Gsk3β
  by western blotting by H2O2 treatment for 1 h. E–H Analysis of expression levels
  of p-Gsk3β/Gsk3β, Bax/Bcl-2 and cle-Cas3/pro-Cas3 by western blotting pre-treated
  with Licl for 1 h, followed by H2O2 treatment for 1 h. I–M Analysis of expression
  levels of p-Akt/Akt, p-Gsk3β/Gsk3β, Bax/Bcl-2, and cle-Cas3/pro-Cas3 by western
  blotting pre-treated with SC79 for 30 min, followed by H2O2 treatment for 1 h. The
  data are represented by the mean ± SEM of three separate samples. (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01).
