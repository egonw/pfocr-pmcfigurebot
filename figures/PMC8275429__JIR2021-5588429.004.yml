caption: Immune-related pathways in periodontitis and their correlation with RBPs.
  (a) Correlation analysis between activities of immune pathways and RBPs expression
  levels. (b) Dot plot and box plot reveal the relationship between the most positively
  correlated immune pathway-RBP pair, BCR signaling pathway, and ISG20. A higher activity
  of BCR signaling pathway and higher expression of ISG20 were observed in periodontitis
  samples. (c) Dot plot and box plot reveal the relationship between the most negatively
  correlated immune pathway-RBP pair, BCR signaling pathway, and ESRP1. A higher activity
  of BCR signaling pathway and lower expression of ESRP1 were observed in periodontitis
  samples.
