caption: 'Measurement of melanin content in B16F10 melanoma cells treated with nomilin
  and limonin. (a) Measurement of melanin content with 25–100 μg/mL nomilin (48.59–194.34
  μM). (b) Measurement of melanin content with 25–100 μg/mL limonin (53.13–212.53
  μM). Relative melanin content was determined at 72 h after treatment. n = 3, error
  bars, mean ± standard deviation. Effect of 100 μg/mL arbutin (367 μM) on melanin
  synthesis and tyrosinase activity in B16F10 cells. (c) B16F10 melanoma cells. (d)
  Morphological changes due to nomilin. B16F10 cells were cultured for 48 h in the
  presence of 25–100 μg/mL (48.59–194.34 μM) nomilin and 100 μg/mL (367 μM) arbutin
  as a positive control or 1 μg/mL α-MSH. Significantly different compared with α-MSH,
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.α-MSH: α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone.'
