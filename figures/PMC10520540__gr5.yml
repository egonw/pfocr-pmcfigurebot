caption: 'Transcriptional response of CD117lo MLPs to short-term stimulation with
  Flt3L or TPO(A) Experimental design: the indicated HSC or CD117hi, int, lo GMP,
  LMPP and MLP subsets were seeded by 500 cell pools in 96-well plates and cultured
  for 6 h under SCF condition with or without Flt3L or TPO (10 ng/mL each) before
  being processed for mini-RNAseq.(B and C) Barplots showing absolute numbers of (B)
  Flt3L- or (C) TPO-responsive genes; black and empty bars correspond respectively
  of up- or downmodulated genes; gray bars and blue numbers correspond to genes shared
  between CD117lo MLPs and the other cell subsets.(D and E) Heatmaps show expression
  of compendia of 120 (D) Flt3L- or (E) TPO-responsive genes within the indicated
  populations; gene expression values are log-transformed, normalized, and scaled;
  genes linked to Notch pathway, multi-lymphoid progenitors (blue) or T/NK- (green)
  or B- (red) or NK/ILC- (yellow) lineages are indicated. Flowchart summarizing the
  filtration and clustering strategies used for extraction of population- and condition-specific
  gene signatures are presented in A.'

  lineages are subjected to differential regulation.
