caption: Overexpression of TP53INP2 resulted in an inhibition to cellular proliferation
  in ccRCC cell lines. (a) TP53INP2 overexpression was stably transfected into the
  786-O, ACHN, and A498 ccRCC cell lines. The relative mRNA level of TP53INP2 was
  determined with qRT-PCR. (b) and (c) The level of TP53INP2 protein was determined
  with western blot. Relative values were estimated with Image J. (d)–(f) CCK-8 assay
  was made for the detection on the cell viability of 786-O, ACHN, and A498. (g)–(j)
  The flow cytometry was performed for the detection on the cell viability of 786-O,
  ACHN, and A498. Data were presented as mean ± SD of three or four independent experiments.
