figure_title: The KEGG pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes
caption: (A) KEGG pathway analysis of the distribution of differentially expressed
  genes. Compared with the LPS-induced group, the distribution of differentially expressed
  genes regulated by compound 3ag distributed in different categories was shown. (B)
  The scatterplot showing KEGG rich distribution of differential genes. PPAR, peroxisome
  proliferatorâ€“activated receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; STAT, signal
  transducers and activators of transcription; AGE-RAGE, advanced glycation end products,
  receptor for advanced glycation end products; FoxO, forkhead box O; AMPK, AMP-activated
  protein kinase.
