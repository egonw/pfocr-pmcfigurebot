caption: Schematic representation of the PDGF signaling pathway. The PDGF family comprises
  PDGF-A, PDGF-B, PDGF-C, and PDGF-D. These factors are abundant in platelet α-granules
  and can also be found in macrophages, vascular endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and
  keratinocytes. They interact as homo- and hetero-dimers (PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB,
  PDGF-CC, and PDGF-DD) with two distinct transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors
  (α and β), leading to the formation of homo- or hetero-dimers and subsequent autophosphorylation.
