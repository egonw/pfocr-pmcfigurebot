caption: 'Immunofluorescence imaging of AhR (A–D) translocation after 1 hour of incubation.
  AhR fluorescence signals throughout the whole cells, (A) within the cytosolic (B)
  and nuclear (C) fractions, and the calculated ratio (nucleus/cytosol, D). Images
  showing immunofluorescence stainings of (HCEC-1CT). Images (a–d) show AhR (red)
  and nuclei (blue) of HCEC for the following conditions: (a) solvent control, (b)
  CH-22 1 μM, (c) B[a]P 1 μM, and (d) ATX-II 1 μM. Bar graphs depict AhR immunofluorescence
  signals within the respective cell compartment or as a nucleus/cytosol ratio (D,
  H) presented as mean + standard deviation (SD) of at least four individual experiments
  conducted in a minimum of technical duplicates with at least four optical fields
  per technical replicate. The data are normalized to the ratio of the solvent control,
  and significances were calculated applying a two-sample t-test at p < 0.05: *, p
  < 0.01: **, and p < 0.001: ***; asterisks indicate significant differences compared
  to the solvent control, and # indicates significant differences of the combinations
  of a compound and CH-22 compared to the compound alone. All images were taken using
  a 20× objective; therefore, the indicated scale bar applies to all images depicted.'
