figure_title: 'Effects of ELA13 on the Smad and ERK signaling pathways in vivo and
  in vitro. (a) Western blot analysis of the expression of p-Smad2/3, Smad2/3, p-ERK1/2,
  and ERK1/2 in vitro, and quantitative results of protein levels in different groups.
  (b) Western blot analysis of the expression of p-Smad2/3, Smad2/3, p-ERK1/2, and
  ERK1/2 in the UUO-induced model, and quantitative results of protein levels in different
  groups. (c, d) Western blot analysis of the expression of fibronectin and α‍-SMA
  under the action of ERK (c) and Smad (d) pathway inhibitors and ELA13 administration
  in vitro, and quantitative results of protein levels in different groups. The data
  are presented as mean±SD of three independent experiments. ** P<0.01 and *** P<0.001,
  the TGF-β1 group vs. the control group, the UUO group vs. the sham group; ## P<0.01
  and ### P<0.001, the ELA13-treated group vs. the TGF-β1 group, the ELA13-treated
  group vs. the UUO group. Smad: small mother against decapentaplegic; ERK: extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; p-: phosphorylated; UUO: unilateral ureteral occlusion;
  α‍-SMA: α‍-smooth muscle actin; SD: standard deviation; TGF-‍β1: transforming growth
  factor-‍β1; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PBS: phosphate-buffered
