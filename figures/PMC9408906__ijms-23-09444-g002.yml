caption: 'Mechanical stimulation induced ATP release from osteoclasts, dependent on
  the P2X7 receptor. (A) Incubation with RANKL evoked differentiation of RAW264.7
  monocytes into TRAP+ multinucleated osteoclasts. TRAP expression was assessed by
  cytochemistry in RAW264.7 cells either in control (left panel) or incubated for
  5d with 35 ng/mL RANKL (right panel). Cells were co-stained with hematoxylin. A
  representative image of n = 3 is shown. Scale bar: 25 µm. (B) RANKL (5d, 35 ng/mL)
  evoked the expression of osteoclastogenic markers in RAW264.7 cells. TRAP: Tartrate
  resistant acid phosphatase, CK: Cathepsin K, MMP9: Metalloprotease 9, CA: Carbonic
  anhydrase, ATPase: Lysosomal ATPase, Intß3: Integrin ß3. mRNA relative quantitation
  was performed using the ΔΔCT method, with Gapdh as the housekeeping gene. (C) Mechanical
  stimulation evoked ATP release from RAW 264.7 cells differentiated with RANKL. Cells
  were mechanically stimulated by pipetting different volumes of the extracellular
  medium (12, 25, 37, 50% of the total volume; one pipetting per second, ten times).
  The control condition corresponds to unperturbed cells. At different times post-stimulation,
  extracellular ATP was measured in the cell media. (D) Maximal ATP release depends
  on the magnitude of mechanical stimulation. Maximum values for different extent
  of mechanical stimulation tested are reported. (E–G) In osteoclasts-enriched fractions
  obtained from serum-gradient fractionation, the mechanical stimulation also evoked
  the ATP release in a controlled and non-lytic manner. Mechanical stimulation (mobilization
  of 37% total volume) evoked ATP release from purified osteoclasts; the kinetic is
  shown in (E), and the maximal release is quantitated in (F). The release of ATP
  evoked by mechanical stimulation was prevented by 30-min pre-incubation with 50
  nM BBG (non-competitive antagonist of the P2X7R), but not with 5 µM carbenoxolone
  (Cbx, blocker of Pannexin-1 hemichannels) or 100 µM glibenclamide (Glib, blocker
  of ATP exocytosis and ABC transporters) (F). Extracellular levels of LDH were measured
  in all the assays to discard cell lysis promoted by mechanical stimulation (G).
  (H) RAW-derived osteoclasts expressed P2X7R. Immunofluorescence was performed in
  three independent experiments; nuclei were stained with Hoechst. Scale bar: 10 µM.
