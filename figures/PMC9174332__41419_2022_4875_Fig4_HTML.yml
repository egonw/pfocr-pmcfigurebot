caption: 'A A Venn diagram of the downstream targets of miR-181d predicted by the
  TargetScan, mirDIP and DIANA tool websites. B PPI networks for CREBRF and KLF6 and
  their related genes constructed using the String website. The circle indicates the
  input gene, and the triangle indicates the predicted related gene. The gene with
  redder color presented higher degree of correlation, while the gene with bluer color
  had lower degree of correlation. C The binding site between miR-181d and KLF6 was
  predicted using the Targetscan website. D A box line diagram based on the KLF6 expression
  data from the GSE36496 dataset. The blue box on the left represents the expression
  of normal control samples, and the red box on the right represents the expression
  of renal fibrosis samples. E miR-181d targeting of KLF6 is verified by dual luciferase
  reporter gene assay. *p < 0.05 vs. mimic NC. F RT-qPCR analysis of KLF6 mRNA expression
  in HK-2 cells after overexpression or silencing of miR-181d. *p < 0.05 vs. mimic
  NC. #p < 0.05 vs. inhibitor NC. G Western blot analysis of KLF6 expression in HK-2
  cells after overexpression or silencing of miR-181d. *p < 0.05 vs. mimic NC. #p < 0.05
  vs. inhibitor NC. The cell experiment was repeated three independent times.'
