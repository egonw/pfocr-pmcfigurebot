caption: Blueberry fraction 7 (BBFr7) by oral gavage inhibits tumor growth in vivo.
  A, MT2 adult T‐cell leukemia cells were injected subcutaneously into NSG mice (n = 5)
  with or without BBFr7 treatment by oral gavage, and the tumors were measured on
  the indicated days. Mean and SD are shown (n = 5). *p < 0.05 compared with the control
  0.9% saline. B, Weight of tumors was measured after the mice were killed. Mean and
  SD are shown (n = 5). *p < 0.05 compared with the control 0.9% saline. C, Pictures
  of tumors are shown with a ruler. D, Bar graphs show the quantification of the relative
  band intensity of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway normalized by β‐actin in the lysate
  of tumors developed in NSG. Mean and SD are shown (n = 4). *p < 0.05 compared with
  the control 0.9% saline. E, Bar graphs show the quantification of the relative band
  intensity of caspase‐3 or cleaved caspase‐3 normalized to β‐actin in the lysate
  of tumors developed in NSG. Data are expressed as mean and SD (n = 4). *p < 0.05
  compared with control 0.9% saline
