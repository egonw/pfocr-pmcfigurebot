figure_title: Effects of TMPRSS2 overexpression on the induction of IL18
caption: 'A–CH1299 cells were transfected with TMPRSS2‐HA or the empty vector (Vector).
  After 48 h, the transfected cells were assayed for the expression of TMPRSS2 (A)
  and the induction of IL18 by qRT–PCR (B) and Western blotting (C).D–HThe expression
  level of IL18 was examined in H1975 cells (D, E) and A549 cells (F–H) exposed to
  PM2.5 at 50 μg/ml for 90 days by qRT–PCR (D, F, and G) and Western blotting (E and
  H). Data information: The results shown in (A, C, E, and H) are from one of three
  similar experiments. β‐actin was used as the loading control. The data shown in
  (E and H) were normalized to β‐actin from three independent experiments. The data
  shown in (B, D–H) represent the means ± SDs from three independent experiments;
  *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01, as analyzed with one‐sample t‐test and compared with vector
  control or untreated cells. Source data are available online for this figure.'
