caption: 'Identification of key pathways modulated within macrophages of the regenerating
  caudal fin from Single-cell RNAseq data. (A) Clustering of the integrated data from
  the 24 hpA caudal fin (cut) and their uninjured counterparts (uncut). AER: apical
  ectodermal ridge, EBL: epithelial basal layers, NCC/NCdC: Neural crest cells/NCC
  derived cells. (B) Feature plot of macrophages subset based on mpeg1.1 expression
  and dimensional reduction plot of their distribution through the cut and uncut conditions.
  (C) Canonical pathway analysis from the Ingenuity Pathway analysis (IPA) of the
  metabolic network. Ratio (genes detected / total number of genes of the pathway)
  within macrophages subset. (D) Heatmap of the cut/uncut gene expression ratio of
  the main glycolysis associated-genes (E) Violin plots of the top differentially
  expressed glycolytic and lactate-associated genes within cut and uncut conditions.
  (F) Heatmap of the cut/uncut expression fold change for the top DE genes through
  the different caudal fin cell populations.'
