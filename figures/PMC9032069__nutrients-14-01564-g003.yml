caption: Ginsenoside Rh4 reverses the EMT procedure of GC in vivo. (A) Western blot
  showing increased E-cadherin and decreased N-cadherin, Vimentin, and Snail in tumor
  tissues under Rh4 treatment. β-Actin was used as an endogenous reference. Quantification
  plots are shown on the right. (B) IF assay. The downward adjustment of E-cadherin
  and upward adjustment of N-cadherin were reversed by Rh4 in vivo. Scale bars = 50
  µm. (C) IHC assays were performed to assess changes in E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Vimentin,
  and Snail. Scale bars = 200 µm. Statistics are exhibited as the mean ± SD of triplicate
  independent experiments; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
