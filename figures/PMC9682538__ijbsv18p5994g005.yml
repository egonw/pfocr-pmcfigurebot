caption: MAML2 is essential for TAM-mediated NOTCH1-dependent transcription. (A) Western
  blot assay showed that M2 macrophages (THP-1 and PBMC-derived) in direct contact
  increased MAML2 expression in DU145-luc and 22RV1-luc cells compared with the noncontact
  and control groups. (B) Lentivirus containing the shMAML2 fragment was infected
  into DU145 and 22RV1 cells, and Western blotting was used to detect the knockdown
  effect. (C) Bioluminescence assays showed that MAML2 depletion in DU145 and 22RV1
  cells abolished M2 macrophages direct contact-mediated cell proliferation. (D) Matrigel-based
  invasion assays showed that MAML2 depletion in DU145 and 22RV1 cells abolished M2
  macrophages direct contact-mediated cell invasion. (E) Immunofluorescence assays
  showed that MAML2 depletion inhibited M2 macrophages direct contact-induced EMT
  by decreasing N-cadherin (far-red) expression in DU145 and 22RV1 cells. (F) Western
  blot assay showed that knocking down MAML2 did not alter M2 macrophages-mediated
  N1ICD release but reduced HES1 and HEY1 expression (scale bar=50 Âµm, *p<0.05, **p<0.01).
