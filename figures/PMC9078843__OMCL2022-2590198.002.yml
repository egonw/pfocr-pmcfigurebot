caption: Proposed pathways of reactive species-induced modifications at tryptophan
  residue. The red-colored structures indicate the potential new modifications at
  tryptophan residue; the structures in grey color show the intermediates of the tryptophan
  modification pathway; the structures in black color show the preidentified tryptophan
  modifications.
