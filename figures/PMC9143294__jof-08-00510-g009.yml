caption: Time profile of balanol production by blnROE strain using the optimized medium
  (A) and analysis of the expression level of the bln gene cluster (B). The blnROE
  strain was cultured in a 15 L tank at 26 Â°C for 11 days with 8 L of medium. The
  culture broth was sampled for analysis of cell growth by determination of dried
  weight and balanol production every two days. The dissolved oxygen was maintained
  at 30% through cultivation. For RNA extraction, 4-day mycelium was used to analyze
  the expression level.
