caption: Interaction of lncRNAs with PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in ESCC. Long non-coding
  RNA Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma Susceptibility Candidate 1 (PTCSC1) upregulates
  the p85 subunit and thus phosphorylate the Akt and increases the mechanistic target
  of rapamycin kinase (mTOR) levels followed by an increase in phosphodiesterase 4A
  (PDE4A) expression. At the same time, lncRNA HCP5 acts on the PDE4A and further
  increases its level, enhancing the cell proliferation, angiogenesis, migration,
  and invasion of ESCC cells. This illustration was created using resources available
  at www.biorender.com (accessed on 25 September 2021).
