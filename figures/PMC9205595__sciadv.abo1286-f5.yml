figure_title: Bace-1 deletion enhances signaling pathways associated with phagocytosis
caption: (A) Volcano plot shows significantly altered gene expression in 4-month-old
  5xFAD;Bace-1fl/fl;Cx3cr1CreER mouse microglia with and without TAM treatment. (B)
  IPA-based canonical pathway analysis of significantly altered microglia genes from
  5xFAD;Bace-1fl/fl;Cx3cr1CreER mice with or without Bace-1 deletion. (C) String-based
  analysis demonstrating potential protein-protein functional interactions and interconnected
  pathways enriched in statistically up-regulated genes after Bace-1 deletion in microglia.
  TLR2 is one of the top hit genes.
article_title: BACE-1 inhibition facilitates the transition from homeostatic microglia
  to DAM-1.
