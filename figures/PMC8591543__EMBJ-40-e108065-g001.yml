figure_title: Lipid metabolism pathways are impaired in PKM2 deficient cells
caption: 'Heatmap showing the altered metabolic pathways in PKM2 KO MCF7 and MDA‐MB‐231
  cells relative to the parental cells (n = 4). Fatty acid metabolism (Acyl Carnitine)
  and long‐chain fatty acid pathways were significantly changed in both cell lines.Heatmap
  showing the differential fatty acid β‐oxidation pathway metabolite levels between
  PKM2 KO MCF7 and MDA‐MB‐ 231 cells, and their respective parental counterparts (n = 4).Decreased
  levels of free carnitine and modified carnitine species in PKM2 KO cell lines as
  compared with their parental counterparts (n = 4).Heatmap showing the decreased
  levels of long‐chain fatty acids in PKM2 KO cell lines relative to their parental
  counterparts (n = 4).Increased acetyl‐CoA in PKM2 KO MCF7 and MDA‐MB 231 cells as
  compared with their parental counterparts (n = 4).Decreased total cholesterol in
  PKM2 KO MCF7 and MDA‐MB 231 cells as compared with their parental counterparts (n = 3).Confocal
  imaging of neutral lipid droplets stained with BODIPY493/503 or Nile red dye in
  PKM2 KO cells relative to the parental cells. Data represent one of three independent
  experiments with similar results. Scale bar, 25 μm. Data information: Data are displayed
  (C, E and F) as means ± SD. Statistical significance was assessed using two‐tailed
  Student’s t‐test, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001. n.s means no significance.
