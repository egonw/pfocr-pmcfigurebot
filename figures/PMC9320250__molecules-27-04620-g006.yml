caption: Synthesis and applications of Cl-doped CDs [,]. (A) Multicolor fluorescent
  Cl-GQDs were synthesized using fructose and hydrochloric acid as raw materials.
  (B) Microwave synthesis of Cl-CQDs by sucralose can be used for photocatalytic reduction
  and degradation of dyes. (C) Cl-CDs synthesized by the chlorine radical substitution
  reaction can rapidly photodegrade phenol cyanine. (D) The synthesis of Cl-GQDs by
  electrochemical oxidation showed good antioxidant activity. (E) Using seagrass as
  raw material, white Cl-GQDs were synthesized using the hydrothermal method for application
  in multicolor cell imaging. (F) Cl-CQDs were obtained by the solvothermal reaction
  of o-phenylenediamine under trichloromethane, and fluorescent Cl-CQDs in four colors
  were obtained by column separation. (G) N and Cl-CDs were synthesized from aloe
  vera, and tartrazine in beverages can be detected based on FRET. (H) The hydrothermal
  synthesis of NCl-GQDs using citric acid and 3,4-dichloroaniline allows for the highly
  sensitive detection of tetracycline. (I) Schematic of the synthesis pathway of X/N-PGQDs
  with excellent sterilization activity under visible light. (J) PCl-CQDs were obtained
  by hydrothermal synthesis of maltose, phosphoric acid, and hydrochloric acid, which
  can be used to detect Fe ions. (K) The S and Cl co-doped CDs derived from palm powder
  exhibit photocatalytic activity. Reprinted/adapted with permission from Ref. [].
