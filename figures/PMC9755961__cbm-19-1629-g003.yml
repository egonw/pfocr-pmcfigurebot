caption: Neutrophils have direct and indirect antitumor effects. (A) Neutrophils directly
  kill tumor cells through the production of H2O2, in a process involving TRPM2, an
  H2O2-dependent channel, thus causing lethal influx of Ca2+ into breast cancer cells.
  In Lewis lung carcinoma and fibrosarcoma transplantation mouse models, tumor-derived
  TNFα induces MET expression on neutrophils, which then interact with HGF and promote
  the production and release of NO by neutrophils, thus killing tumor cells. In cytotoxic
  assays of neutrophils against the Jurkat human T cell leukemic cell line, neutrophils
  express TRAIL on the cell surfaces and release it into the culture medium, thus
  increasing leukemia cell apoptosis. Arg1 derived from activated neutrophils or dead
  cells has been shown to induce apoptosis of the HeLa human cervical epithelial carcinoma
  cell line as well as the SF268 human glioblastoma cell line through activation of
  the ER stress pathway. Neutrophils kill cancer cells and attenuate tumorigenesis
  through releasing catalytically active NE, which proteolytically liberates the CD95
  death domain (DD) and leads to breast cancer cell apoptosis. (B) In 3-methylcholathrene
  (3-MCA)-induced sarcomagenesis, neutrophils increase the production and release
  of IL-12 in macrophages, thereby promoting the polarization and IFN-γ production
  in a subset of CD4-CD8-TCRβ+ unconventional T cells and exerting an anti-tumor response.
  Cross-talk between N1 TANs and activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells induces the expression
  of costimulatory molecules such as CD54, CD86, OX40 L, and 4-1BBL on the neutrophil
  surface, which in turn promote T cell activation and INF-γ production. (C) Neutrophils
  directly kill breast cancer target cells via Fc-mediated destruction of the cancer
  cell plasma membrane (trogoptosis). Destruction of antibody-opsonized cancer cells
  mediated by neutrophils is enhanced by blocking the CD47-SIRPα do not-eat-me checkpoint.
