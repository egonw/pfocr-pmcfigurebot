caption: GO terms and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis based on the NaCl-induced DEGs
  in roots of both E+ and E− A. inebrians. The GO terms of up-regulated (A) and down-regulated
  (B) DEGs between 200RE+ and 0RE+. The GO terms of up-regulated (C) and down-regulated
  (D) DEGs between 200RE− and 0RE−. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of up-regulated
  (E) and down-regulated (F) DEGs between 200RE+/0RE+ and 200RE−/0RE−.
