caption: 'JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway inactivation upregulates P53 expression participating
  AMPK-mediated GPX4-dependent ferroptosis. 786-O cells were transfected with a JAK2
  overexpression plasmid. (a and b) Western blotting assay shows the effect of JAK2
  overexpression and the expression of JAK2, p-JAK2, STAT3, p-STAT3, P53, and GPX4.
  (c) P53 mRNA levels was detected by qRT-PCR. (d–g) Overexpression of JAK2 reverses
  the changes in cell death, GSH, MDA, and cellular iron caused by AICAR and erastin.
  Independent experiments were repeated three times, and representative data were
  shown. Data shown represent mean ± SD from at least three independent experiments.
  Comparisons were performed using Student''s t-test and one-way ANOVA. Fer-1: ferrostatin-1;
  ns: not significant. ∗∗∗p < 0.001 and ###p < 0.001.'
