caption: 'Decreased proliferation of early NK cell developmental stages upon TXNIP
  knockdown. (A) Gene set enrichment analysis plots of the Gene Ontology cell division
  pathway upon TXNIP knockdown in HSC on d3 (left) and ST3 cells on d7 (right). NES:
  normalized enrichment score. (B) The relative expression of CDKN1A, BTG3, and CDC42
  in d3 HSC and d7 ST3 was determined using RT-qPCR (mean ± SEM; n = 3–4). (C) The
  number of up- and downregulated DEGs in the Gene Ontology positive and negative
  regulation of mitotic cell cycle pathways in HSC on d3 (left) and ST3 cells on d7
  (right). (D,E) HSC were transduced with TXNIP knockdown or overexpression vectors.
  (D) eGFP+ HSC sorted after transduction (d0), were labelled with CellTrace Violet
  and cultured in NK cell-specific conditions. On day 5, the CellTrace Violet signal
  was assessed in gated HSC and ST1 to ST3 of knockdown (left) and overexpression
  (right) cultures with flow cytometry. The frequency of CellTracelow cells is indicated
  (mean ± SEM; n = 5). Overlaid histograms of representative samples are shown. (E)
  Apoptosis was assessed on day 5 of culture by flow cytometry in the indicated developmental
  stages of knockdown (left) and overexpression (right) cultures by staining with
  propidium iodide (PI) and Annexin V. The percentage of early (Annexin V+PI−) and
  late apoptotic cells (Annexin V+PI+) is shown (mean ± SEM; n = 5). (F) The frequency
  and (G) the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD122 expression in ST4 + 5 NK
  cells were determined by flow cytometry on d14 and d21 of TXNIP knockdown (left)
  and overexpression cultures (right) (mean ± SEM; n = 4–8). * and ** represent statistical
  significance compared to control transduced conditions with p < 0.05 and p < 0.01,
  respectively.'
