caption: 'Different (hypothetical) working-mechanisms of ablation/neurostimulation
  of the intralaminar thalamus in a coronal slice through the brain and basal ganglia.
  Upper left image: Course of the medial and lateral pain pathways, in which the medial
  pain pathway travels through the CM-Pf of the intralaminar thalamus and ascending
  pain signals are suppressed by neurostimulation. Upper right image: Responsive-neurostimulation
  in epilepsy in which signs of epilepsy are registered by a cortical strip lead that
  directly activates the neurostimulator to send an ‘epilepsy blocking’ intralaminar
  signal through the brain electrode. Lower left image: DBS in DOC. On the left hemisphere:
  a situation in which loss of striatal output results in a negative-feedback loop
  and excessive (pallidal) inhibition of the thalamus. On the right hemisphere: a
  situation in which this negative-feedback loop is breached by neurostimulation.
  Lower middle image: DBS in GTS. On the left hemisphere: a situation in which striatal
  ‘overactivity’ eventually results in inhibition of the GPi and excitation of the
  thalamus and, thereby, excessive (sub)cortical activity. On the right hemisphere:
  a situation in which intralaminar neurostimulation inhibits this excessive overactivity.
  Lower right image: DBS in Parkinson’s disease. On the left hemisphere: classical
  model of Parkinson’s disease, in which there is excessive inhibition of the thalamus
  by the GPi, secondary to a decreased excitatory drive from the STN and decreased
  inhibitory input from the putamen. On the right hemisphere: a situation in which
  neurostimulation restores this aberrant thalamic outflow. Upper middle image: Schematic
  3D drawing of the relationship of the individual intralaminar nuclei (also see Mai
  et al.). Abbreviations in 2D-image: CN = caudate nucleus, CM-Pf = centromedian-parafascicular
  complex, GPE = globus pallidus externus, GPI = globus pallidus internus, P = putamen,
  SN = substantia nigra, STN = subthalamic nucleus, VPM = ventral posteromedial nucleus,
  VPL = ventral posterolateral nucleus. Abbreviations in 3D-image: A = anterior thalamic
  nucleus, CeM = central medial nucleus, CL = central lateral nucleus, IML = lamina
  medullaris interna, LD = lateral dorsal nucleus, LG = lateral geniculate nucleus,
  LP = lateral posterior nucleus, MD = mediodorsal nucleus, MG = medial geniculate
  nucleus, Pc = paracentral nucleus, VA = ventral anterior nucleus, VL = ventral lateral
  nucleus, P = pulvinar, TR = thalamic reticular nucleus. Image made by Inge Kos.'
