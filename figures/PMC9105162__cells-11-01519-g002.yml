caption: 'Hcd1-as cells have defects in mitosis and cytokinesis. (a) Logarithmically
  growing wild type (HPH1047) and hcd1-as (HPH1894) cells in YPDS medium were incubated
  with 5 µM 1NM-PP1 at 30 °C for the indicated time. Cells were fixed with 70% ethanol
  and DNA was stained with DAPI. BF, brightfield. Scale bar, 10 µm. Asterisks indicate
  unseparated cells. Scale bar, 10 µm. Note that cells are larger in hcd1-as (2 h).
  (b) Quantification of a. Upper graph: percentage of unbudded cells with one nucleus.
  Lower graph: percentage of large budded cells with two nuclei, one in the mother
  and the other in the bud, and unseparated large cell bodies with two or more nuclei.
  More than 100 cells were analysed at each time point. The experiment was performed
  in triplicate and the combined results are shown. Statistical significance of the
  differences between wild type and hcd1-as cells was determined by t-test and indicated
  by single or double asterisk. (c) Logarithmically growing wild type (HPH1968) and
  hcd1-as (HPH1969) cells carrying GTP-TUB1 in YPDS medium were incubated with 5 µM
  1NM-PP1 at 30 °C for 1 h. Images were captured without fixation. Shown are projected
  images. BF, brightfield. Scale bar, 5 µm. Statistical significance was determined
  by the t-test. (d) Incomplete cytokinesis and cell separation of hcd1-as cells from
  the experiment in c. Asterisks indicate newly formed buds. Yellow arrows point to
  the connections between mother and daughter cells of the last cell cycle. BF, brightfield.
  Scale bar, 1 µm.'
