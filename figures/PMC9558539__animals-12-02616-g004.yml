caption: Effects of acetate on the expression of key proteins involved in the mTOR
  signaling pathway and lipid metabolism. Bovine mammary epithelial cells were exposed
  to either 0 (as a control group) or 12 mM acetate for a protein expression analysis.
  Western blotting analysis of mTOR, p-mTOR, S6K1, 4EBP1, p-4EBP1, ACCα, p-ACCα, FAS,
  perilipin-1, and PPARγ. The data were based on triplicate experiments.
