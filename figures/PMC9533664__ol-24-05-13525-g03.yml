caption: Effect of Con A on the activation of ERK1/2, JNK1/2/3 and p38 in HCCLM3 cells.
  (A) The expression levels of ERK1/2, JNK1/2/3 and p38 in HCCLM3 cells were analyzed
  by western blotting. Relative protein level of (B) p-ERK1/2/t-ERK1/2, (C) p-JNK1/2/3/t-JNK1/2/3
  and (D) p-p38/t-p38 in HCCLM3 cells. The results of the densitometric analysis of
  ERK1/2, JNK1/2/3 and p38 activation were normalized to the levels of GAPDH. The
  data were expressed as the mean ± SD (n=3). *P<0.05 and **P<0.01 vs. the control
  group. Con A, concanavalin A (10 µg/ml); p, phosphorylated; t, total.

  F-actin redistribution and assembly via MAPK signaling pathway.
