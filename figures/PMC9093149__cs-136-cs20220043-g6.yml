  cell properties via SOX2 inhibition in HCT116 cells
caption: (A) The inhibition efficiencies of SOX2 by siRNA transfection were determined
  by Western blotting. The expression of α‐tubulin is as an internal loading control.
  (B,C) The effects of SOX2 suppression on sphere formation abilities were analyzed
  and quantified. Bars presented as the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments.
  *, P < 0.05, compared to indicated cells; scale bar = 100 μm. (D–F) The migration
  and invasion abilities of SOX2-silenced cells were measured in transwell assay.
  Results are represented as the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. *,
  P<0.05, compared with indicated cells; scale bar = 100 μm. (G) The cell viability
  of SOX2-silenced cells was analyzed using MTT assay after treatment with 5-FU (10
  μM) for 24 h. Results are represented as the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments.
  *, P<0.05, compared with indicated cells.
