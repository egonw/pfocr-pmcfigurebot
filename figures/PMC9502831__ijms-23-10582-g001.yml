caption: 'Schematic illustration of the canonical Wnt pathway. (A). In the presence
  of Wnt ligands interacting with LRP5/6 and frizzled, the β-catenin degradation complex
  is sequestrated. Cytosolic accumulation of β-catenin leads to nuclear translocation
  and binding to transcription factors in the Lef/Tcf family. The resulting active
  transcriptional complex controls the expression of target genes involved in tissue
  generation, regeneration and, self-renewal. (B). In the absence of Wnt ligands,
  the interaction between DVL and axin leads to the phosphorylation of cytosolic β-catenin
  by a protein complex involving APC, axin, and GSK3. β-catenin is then degraded by
  ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. LRP: lipoprotein receptor-related protein. DVL:
  dishevelled-APC: adenomatosis polyposis coli. GSK: glycogen synthase kinase. TCF/Lef1:
  T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor. DPSCs: dental pulp stem cells. SCAPs: stem
  cells from apical papilla.'
