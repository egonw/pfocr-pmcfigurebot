caption: The CXCL12/CXCR4 axis was a potential cell-to-cell communication manner between
  CXCL12+ TAMs and PD-L1+ Bregs. A. A circle plot of the number of cellular communications
  in six identified types of cell populations in liver tissue. The width represents
  the number of cell interactions. B. A circle plot of the weights/strength of the
  cellular communications in six identified types of cell populations in liver tissue.
  The width represents the weights/strength of the interaction. C. Depiction of all
  the significant ligand-receptor pairs that contribute to the signaling sending from
  three macrophage types to four B cell types. The dot color and size represents the
  calculated communication probability and p-values. The p-values were computed using
  a one-sided permutation test. D. Circle plots of the CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling pathway
  network between six identified types of cell populations. The width represents the
  weights/strength of the interaction. E. A heatmap showing the relative importance
  of each cell group based on the computed four network centrality measures of the
  CXCL12 signaling pathway network.
