caption: Sulfanegen displays antioxidant property due to release of H2S via 3MST pathway
  and mitigates peroxide and Aβ1-42cytotoxicity. (A) Radical scavenging property of
  sulfanegen was analyzed by a well-known DPPH assay as described in the methods section.
  (B) Cellular ROS generation was measured using DCFDA where cells were treated with
  H2O2 in the presence (top right) or absence of sulfanegen (bottom right) and images
  were taken after 8 h treatment. The left panel of images shows cells without H2O2
  or sulfanegen exposure (top) and sulfanegen only (bottom controls). (C) Under similar
  conditions as B, fluorescence intensity was measured using a multimode plate reader.
  (D) Data represents dose dependent release of H2S from sulfanegen. (E) H2S release
  from sulfanegen was measured in the presence or absence of 3MST or CBS or CSE inhibitors
  as described in the methods section. (F) Protection of H2O2 cytotoxicity in the
  cells treated with sulfanegen in the presence or absence of 3MST inhibitor, I3MT3.
  (G) Cytotoxicity in the cells treated with Aβ1-42 +/− sulfanegen in the presence
  or absence of I3MT3 after 24 h treatment. Statistical significance was assessed
  by a one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.
