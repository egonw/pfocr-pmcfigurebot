caption: SUV39H1 and SUV39H2 mediate the repression of antiandrogen-induced retroelements.
  (A) RT-qPCR analysis showing the transcript levels of the indicated RE subtypes,
  IL6, IFNB1, and NR3C1 and (B) ChIP-qPCR analysis of H3K9me3 levels at the indicated
  REs in control (sgC) versus double SUV39H1/SUV39H2 knockdown (KD) (sgSUV39H1/shSUV39H2)
  LNCaP cells treated with Enz (10 µM) or DMSO (Veh) for 31 d. Error bars represent
  SD and significance was calculated using two-way ANOVA followed by Sidak’s multiple
  comparisons test. Results are representative of three biological repeats performed
  in triplicate. (C) Correlograms show Pearson's correlations, pairwise, between ssGSEA
  scores for various gene signatures for Enz- or abiaterone-exposed (n = 31) and naïve
  (n = 61) mCRPC transcriptional profiles derived from polyA RNA-seq data. Correlations
  significant at P < 0.05 are highlighted in red font in the correlograms. “H3K9me”
  signature was derived from the expression levels of H3K9me writers and readers.
  (D) Proposed model. Enz treatment induces the derepression of the repeat elements.
  This is followed by processing of their transcripts into dsRNAs that can bind to
  and activate RIG-I–like receptors (RLR), leading to MAVS activation. MAVS activation
  triggers IFN-mediated viral mimicry responses, resulting in growth inhibition and
  cytotoxicity in CRPC cells. GR up-regulation is a marker of the Enz-induced inflammatory
  signaling pathway. EnzR cells epigenetically adapt to evade viral mimicry through
  increased deposition of repressive marks such as H3K9-trimethylation on specific
  REs and inhibiting their activation.
