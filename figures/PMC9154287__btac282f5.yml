caption: Underground reactions show similar potential to produce value-added compounds
  as heterologous reactions. The figure compares the impact of adding the set of 543
  underground reactions to the native network (vertical line) with that of adding
  the same number of randomly selected heterologous reactions (histograms). (A) Distribution
  of the number of target compounds where sufficient yield increment was attained
  across 1000 instances of randomly selected heterologous reaction sets. Underground
  reactions show comparable yield increment (nine cases, P = 0.168, randomization
  test). (B) Distribution of the number of non-native target compounds which cannot
  be produced by the native metabolic network. There is no significant difference
  compared to underground reactions (four cases, P = 0.238, randomization test). Vertical
  line represents the production properties of the underground metabolic network on
  both plots
