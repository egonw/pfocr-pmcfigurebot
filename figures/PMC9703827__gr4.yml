caption: RvE1 and C9 attenuated oxidative stress through Nrf2 pathway in diabetic
  mice. (A) Bubble chart showing significant enrichment of DEGs in various pathways.
  (B) Relative expression levels are shown for genes in oxidative stress-related pathway
  among db/db vs. WT and STZ vs. WT. n = 3 mice/group. (C,D) Representative immunoblotting
  bands of Nrf2, NQO1, and HO1 in the hippocampus of db/db mice and STZ mice after
  treatment with RvE1 or C9. n = 3 mice/group. (E, F) Quantitative analysis of Nrf2/actin,
  NQO1/actin, and HO1/actin. n = 3 mice/group. (G–J) The activities of SOD and levels
  of MDA in the hippocampus of db/db mice and STZ mice after treatment with RvE1 or
  C9 were measured. n = 3 mice/group. (K, M) Representative immunohistochemical staining
  of 8-OHdG in the hippocampus of db/db mice and STZ mice after treatment with RvE1
  or C9. n = 3 mice/group. Scale bar = 20 μm. (L, N) Quantitative analysis of relative
  8-OHdG density in the hippocampus. n = 3 mice/group. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
  C9, chemerin-9; DEGs, differentially expressed genes.
