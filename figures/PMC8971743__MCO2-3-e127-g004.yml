caption: Redox regulation of the insulin signaling pathway. Normally, moderate ROS
  levels inactivate PTPB1 and PTEN and activate AKT, prompting glucose uptake through
  GLUT4. However, excessive ROS accumulation leads to glutathionylation modification
  and proteasomal degradation of MKP‐1, which prevents insulin signaling. Simultaneously,
  ROS burden also inactivates AKT, inhibiting GLUT4 and subsequent glucose uptake,
  which eventually causes type 2 diabetes
