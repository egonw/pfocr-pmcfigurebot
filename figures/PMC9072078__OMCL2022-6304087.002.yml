caption: 'Effect of DEAC (a), CM (b), AMB (c), and VA (d) (5-100 μg/mL) in LPS-induced
  nitrite production. BV-2 cells were pretreated with the drugs for 1 h and incubated
  with or without LPS (0.5 μg/mL) for 24 h. All values are expressed as mean ± SEM
  of concentration of nitrite. One-way ANOVA was used followed by the Bonferroni posttest.
  #vs. control group (DMSO 0.1%) (p < 0.05), ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01 vs. LPS group,
  n = 4/group.'
