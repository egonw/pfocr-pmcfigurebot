caption: '(A) Biological processes identified by GO functional enrichment analysis
  of the miRNAs upregulated in the SC adipose tissue of the HIV+ twin; (B) Biosynthetic
  pathways identified by KEGG functional analysis of the predicted target genes controlled
  by the miRNAs upregulated in the SC adipose tissue of the HIV+ twin; (C) Biosynthetic
  pathways identified by KEGG functional analysis of the predicted target genes controlled
  by the miRNAs upregulated in the plasma. The p-value indicates the significance
  of the pathways correlated to the miRNAs: the lower the p-value, the more significant
  the pathway is. âˆ’log10(p-value) > 1.30 corresponds to p < 0.05.'
