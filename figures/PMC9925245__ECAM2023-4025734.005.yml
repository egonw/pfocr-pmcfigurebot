caption: The pro-apoptotic effect of Z-Ajoene on NSCLC cell apoptosis is activated
  by ERS via DLG1/YAP signaling inhibition. (a) Western blot revealed DLG1, LATS2,
  and YAP protein expressions in A549 and H1299 cells treated with Z-ajoene. (b) The
  RT-qPCR assay revealed DLG1 and YAP mRNA expressions in A549 and H1299 cells. (c)
  The difference in cell apoptosis between groups was determined by flow cytometry.
  (d) Differences in Bip, PERK, ATF4, and CHOP protein expressions between groups
  were detected using the western blot analysis.
