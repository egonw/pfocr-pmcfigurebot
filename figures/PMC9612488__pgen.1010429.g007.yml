figure_title: Edis-p rescues the innate immunity and neurodevelopment phenotypes elicited
  by Edis depletion
caption: (A-C) Stably transfected S2 cells carrying the pMT-Gal4 and UAS-shEdis or
  UAS-sh-w (control) constructs were transfected with empty vector or an expression
  construct encoding shEdis-resistant Flag-tagged Edis-p. Cells were either left untreated
  or treated with PGN and levels of the Dpt (A) and Edis (B) transcripts were measured
  by RT-qPCR (student t test, n = 3, ** p<0.01; *** p<0.001; ns, non-significant).
  (C) An anti-Flag immunoblot shows Fag-Edis-p expression in samples from A. Non-specific
  bands are labeled with asterisks. (D) Confocal images of dorsal anterior regions
  of adult brains with various MB morphology phenotypes. Depletion of Edis in neurons
  resulted in a spectrum of severe, age-dependent morphological defects in the MBs
  as noted above each panel. (E) MB morphology phenotypes were quantified in 3-5d
  old flies with neuron-specific expression of control shgfp or shEdis, together with
  an UAS-Edis, UAS-Flag-Edis-p or empty vector transgene, driven by the Elav-Gal4
  driver (Chi-squared test). Sample numbers and percentage of normal MB in each genotype
  are shown (* p<0.05; *** p<0.001). (F) Climbing activity of 3d- and 30d-old flies
  of the same genotype as in E is shown (student t test, n = 2â€“5, * p<0.05; ** p<0.01;
  *** p<0.001; ns, non-significant). (G) A model of the proposed mechanism of function
  of Edis in the IMD antibacterial innate immunity signaling pathway.
