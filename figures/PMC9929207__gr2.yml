caption: Differential expression analysis, annotation, and functional enrichment analysis
  a) Workflow of sequencing analysis showing sequential steps and various tools and
  pipelines employed for transcriptome profiling. b), c) A comparative bar diagram
  representation of the number of (b) DEGs; and (c) Significant biologies/Biological
  processes, present in various datasets in the transcriptome profiling study. d)
  Pie chart representation of the top five GO terms and pathway summary based on all
  the DEGs in the various datasets showing approximately 5% of the total DEGs belonging
  to the pathways involved in cancer progression. e) Non-hierarchical heatmap representation
  depicting the expression profile and variation in average log2 fold change among
  DEGs in various datasets in the transcriptome profiling study. The color bar represents
  the expression values with green representing the lowest (downregulation) and red
  representing the highest (upregulation) expression levels. The various datasets
  used for expression profiling are labeled on the top. f) Volcano plot representation
  of the complete transcript list according to their average log2 fold change and
  p-values for various datasets in the transcriptome profiling study with differential
  transcripts highlighted in blue. The plot displays DEGs along the dimensions of
  biological significance (average log2 fold change) and statistical significance
  (p). Genes with an absolute log2 fold change> 2 and a p-value< 0.05 were considered
  as DEGs. g) Venn diagram representation created using Venny 2.1.0 showing the 77
  common elements in the transcriptome profiling of the in vitro HNSCC cell line model
  (A-D datasets). h) Venn diagram representation created using Venny 2.1.0 showing
  the five common genes in the 77 common elements in the transcriptome profiling of
  the in vitro HNSCC cell line model (A-D datasets). i) Venn diagram representation
  created using Venny 2.1.0 showing the two common genes in the 16 common elements
  in the transcriptome profiling of the in vitro HNSCC cell line model (A-D datasets).
