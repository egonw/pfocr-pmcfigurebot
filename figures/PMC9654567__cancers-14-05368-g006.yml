caption: 'SUN5 overexpression accelerated the tumorigenicity of LoVo cells in vivo.
  (A) The subcutaneous tumor in nude mice formed by LoVo cells transfected with control
  and SUN5-OE lentivirus (n = 4 in each group). After two weeks, all the mice developed
  tumors at the injection site; whole-body imaging was performed for each nude mouse,
  and the representative pictures were recorded and presented. (B) Images of subcutaneous
  tumorigenic nude mice after skin cutting. (C) Images of CRC tumor xenografts from
  each mouse. (D) Tumor volumes were recorded and analyzed (** p < 0.01). (E) Tumor
  weights were evaluated (* p < 0.05). (F) Nude mice weights were recorded and analyzed.
  (G) IHC staining of tumor tissues verified that SUN5 and pERK1/2 signals were still
  significantly obvious in the SUN5-OE group at the examination time (two weeks after
  the xenograft). Scale bar: 50 Î¼m. (H,I) Western-blotting assay showed the expression
  of SUN5, pERK1/2, Cyclin D1, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin in tumor xenografts
  (in which two tumor tissue samples were randomly selected from each group; * p <
  0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001).'
