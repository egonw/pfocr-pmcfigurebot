caption: Survival analyses of glioma patients based on the mRNA level of NKD1. The
  survival analyses were conducted using the Kaplanâ€“Meier method according to the
  TCGA dataset, which reflected that higher-NKD1 mRNA level was correlated with better
  overall survival (a), cancer-specific survival (b), and progress-free survival (c)
  of glioma patients. Data were compared by log-rank test.
