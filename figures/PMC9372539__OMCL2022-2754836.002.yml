caption: Immunoassay of two clusters. (a) Cluster 1 was enriched with immune-related
  pathways. (b) Cluster 2 was enriched with some tumor-related pathway. (c) The infiltrating
  levels of 22 immune cell types in cluster 1/2 subtypes in the TCGA cohort. ∗P <
  0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001. Immune score (d), stromal score (e), ESTIMATE
  score (f), tumor purity (g), immune cells (h), immune function (i), mRNAsi (j),
  and EREG-mRNAsi (k) in two clusters. (l) The difference of the expression of PD1
  and CTLA4 between normal and tumor tissues. (m) The difference of the expression
  of PD1 and CTLA4 between the two clusters. (n) The correlation between PD1 and mRLs.
  (o) The correlation between CTLA4 and mRL (p) IPS analysis.
