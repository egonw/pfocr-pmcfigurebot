caption: Perturbation studies confirm subtype-specific therapeutic vulnerabilities
  in prostate cancer cell lines. (a) Dose-response curves showing the effect of Torin2
  (mTOR inhibitor), antimycin (oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor), and GSK-J4 (histone
  demethylase inhibitor) on the viability of AR-null and AR-positive cell lines. n
  = at least three biological replicates. (b) Bar graphs summarizing the effective
  drug concentration 50% (EC50) of Torin2, antimycin, and GSK-J4 measured in the PC
  cell lines.
