caption: Summary of the pathway analysis in the leaves of young oil palm plants under
  salinity stress using the Pathway Topology Analysis modules of MetaboAnalyst 5.0.
  The metabolome view resulted from the analysis in the Pathway Topology Analysis
  module using the Hypergeometric test, the relative betweenness centrality node importance
  measure, and the latest KEGG version of the Oryza sativa pathway library. Pathway
  impact takes into account both node centrality parameters—betweenness centrality
  and degree centrality—and represents the importance of annotated compounds in a
  specific pathway.
