caption: 'DNTTIP1 enhances cell migration, invasion, and metastasis of NPC. (a-c)
  Migration and invasion abilities were determined using the indicated stable cells.
  Representative data of three independent experiments. Data are represented as the
  mean ± SD. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 using Student''s t-test. (d-i) The indicated
  stable cells were injected into the tail vein of BALB/c nude mice to construct a
  lung metastasis model (n=8 per group). General views (left, scale bar: 5mm) and
  H&E staining of lung tissues of the mouse models with the indicated cells (middle,
  scale bar: 500μm; right, scale bar: 100μm). The red arrows indicate macroscopic
  pulmonary nodules (d, g). Lung weight (e, h), and quantification of macroscopic
  metastatic nodules (f, i). Data are represented as the mean ± SD. *** p < 0.001
  using Student''s t-test.'
