caption: AFAP1L1 is associated with integrin signaling and promotes ITGA5 expression
  in GC. A, B GO enrichment analysis (A) and KEGG pathway analysis (B) were performed
  by differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between AFAP1L1 high- and low-expression
  group in TCGA STAD database. The top 30 pathways were shown in bubble diagrams.
  C Representative results of integrin-related pathways from Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
  (GSEA) of AFAP1L1 in TCGA STAD database. D Pearson correlation analysis of AFAP1L1
  and ITGA5 in GC using data from TCGA STAD database. E Analysis using TCGA STAD database
  showed ITGA5 expression in GC tissues and normal gastric tissues and its effect
  on prognosis of GC patients. F Western blot analysis to detect the effect of AFAP1L1
  overexpression or knockdown on the expression of ITGA5, ITGB3 and integrin downstream
  effectors FAK, ERK. p-FAK and p-ERK represented their activation forms. G The representative
  IHC images from serial sections of GC samples showed AFAP1L1, ITGA5, p-FAK and p-ERK
  expression in GC tissues with high or low AFAP1L1 expression
article_title: AFAP1L1 promotes gastric cancer progression by interacting with VAV2
  to facilitate CDC42-mediated activation of ITGA5 signaling pathway.
