caption: 'NCLX regulates the expression of genes involved in proliferation, metabolism,
  and translation.A, volcano plot comparing differentially expressed genes between
  shScramble and shNCLX #2 HASMCs. B, pathway analysis of A using the Reactome pathways
  gene set ranking significantly upregulated (red) and downregulated (blue) pathways
  based on normalized enrichment score (NES). Heatmaps comparing differential expression
  of shScramble and shNCLX #2 HASMCs for (C) translation, (D) glycolysis, and (E)
  cell cycle checkpoints from the Reactome pathway gene sets. F, GSEA enrichment plots
  using the Reactome pathways gene set comparing shNCLX #3 and shScramble HASMCs showing
  a positive correlation in the enrichment of degradation of the extracellular matrix.
  Quantification of (G) LAMA5 (one-way ANOVA, F[2,15] = 1.024, p = 0.3829, with Dunnett’s
  post hoc test, p = 0.8873 for shNCLX #2 and p = 0.5273 for shNCLX #3) and (H) COL15A1
  (one-way ANOVA, F[2,12] = 2.069, p = 0.1690, with Dunnett’s post hoc test, p = 0.1409
  for shNCLX #2 and p = 0.9244 for shNCLX #3) mRNA expression in shScramble (n = 5),
  shNCLX #2 (n = 5), and shNCLX #3 (n = 5) HASMCs using RT–quantitative PCR. GSEA,
