caption: Inflammatory signals between photoreceptor, microglia, and Müller glia. Damaged
  or dying photoreceptors release signal molecules that stimulate the activation of
  microglia and Müller glia. In Müller glia, activation of NFGR promotes TNFα production;
  Edn2 binds to Ednrb promotes LIF transcription; LIF binding to gp130 activates the
  JAK2/STAT3 pathway, which promotes Müller glial neuroprotection; IL-1β binding to
  IL-1R1 interferes with glutamate conversion into glutamine, resulting in elevated
  extracellular glutamate concentration. In microglia, activation of JAK2/STAT3 signaling
  stimulates the release of inflammatory molecules. SOCS1/SOCS3 act as negative feedback
  factors of JAK/STAT pathway; AG490 specifically inhibits JAK2. Ligands-binding to
  TNFR, IL-1R, and TLR stimulates NF-κB signaling cascades, promoting transcription
  of inflammatory genes including NLRP3, pro-IL-1β, and pro-IL-18; ATP stimulates
  K+ efflux via P2X7R, promoting NLRP3 inflammasome activation and the release of
  active caspase-1, mature IL-1β, and IL-18. Biological agents like infliximab and
  adalimumab provide neuroprotection by neutralizing TNFα. Anakinra blocks the biologic
  activity of IL-1β. AMWAP prevents NF-κB translocating into the nucleus by inhibiting
  IκBα degradation. NAC suppresses the activation of NLRP3. BBG and PPADS reduce the
  activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome via inhibiting P2X7R signaling. AMWAP, activated
