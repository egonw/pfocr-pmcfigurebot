caption: Effects of CHDT on the body mass and muscle strength of mice with Dex-induced
  muscle atrophy. (A) Experimental protocol. CHDT was orally administered daily to
  6-week-old mice for 30 days, and from 14 days after the start of administration,
  Dex was IP injected daily. (B) Body mass and (C) grip strength of the mice were
  measured on days 0, 7, 14, 18, 22, 26, and 30. “ns” indicates that there was no
  statistically significant difference between all groups. (p > 0.05). Different letters
  indicate statistically significant differences; p < 0.05, a > b > c > d.
