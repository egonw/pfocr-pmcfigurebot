caption: Antiviral response in the ADE Mechanism. (A) Upregulation of the DAK and
  Atg5/12 and downregulation of the MDA5 and RIG-1, which are the components of the
  TLR-independent antiviral pathway, results in the suppression of type-1 interferon
  and proinflammatory cytokine production. (B) An immune complex with FcÎ³RIIa co-ligate
  to LILRB1 inhibits SYK activation, and revocation of the ISGs expression takes place.
  (C) IL-10 produced after FcR and immune complex interaction triggers the SOCS and
  inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine production by impeding the JAK/STAT signaling
  pathway.
