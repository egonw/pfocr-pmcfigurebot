caption: Effects of insulin on the reproduction of model silkworm by regulating blood
  sugar(A) Trehalose level in hemolymph (n = 3).(A′) Egg number after trehalose injection
  in WT. Trehalose (0.5, 1.0, or 5.0 mg per pupa) was injected into WT in the P1 stage,
  and the number of eggs produced and laid was counted at the adult stage. Hemolymph
  samples were collected at 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 144 h after 1.0 mg trehalose injection
  per pupa.(B) Total AKT and phosphorylated AKT protein levels in the fat body. The
  gray values were calculated using ImageJ and the blue data represent the gray value
  ratio of P-AKT/β-actin and AKT/β-actin. The protein of AKT and P-AKT is 60 kD, and
  the protein of β-actin is 42 kD.(C) Egg number of WT injected with LY294002. LY294002
  (LY), a PI3K/Akt signaling pathway inhibitor, was injected into body fluids at a
  dose of 0.001 nmol per pupa in P1, and the number of eggs produced and laid was
  counted at the adult stage.(D and E) Trehalose level in hemolymph (D and E) and
  Egg number (D′ and E′) after bovine insulin supplementation respectively in TBH
  and WT silkworm. Bovine insulin was injected into the body fluid in P1 at a dose
  of 100 μg per pupa. The hemolymph samples (n = 3) were collected at 0, 30, 60, and
  90 min after injection to investigate the trehalose content and further count the
  number of eggs made and laid at the adult stage. The control (CK) was injected with
  the same volume of saline solution.NC, negative control. Except for (B), the data
  in the figures were the mean ± SD. The data in (A, D, and E) were analyzed by the
  Student’s t test and the significance of the difference was ∗, p < 0.05; ∗∗, p < 0.01;
  ∗∗∗, p < 0.001. The data in (A′, C, D′, and E′) were analyzed by ANOVA, and the
  different letter among groups presents a significant difference.
