caption: (a) Flow diagram for RNA-seq evaluation in eligible HV and MBC patients.
  (b) Sum of TPM values for all genes differentially expressed (p < 0.001) between
  Parsortix PC1 harvests obtained from HV comparators and MBC patients. (c) Genes
  from the KEGG Cancer Pathway were differentially expressed between the HV and MBC
  harvests (p < 0.05) (d). Net TPM score of these 20 genes for HV and MBC samples.
  CTC, circulating tumor cell; HV, healthy volunteer; MBC, metastatic breast cancer.
