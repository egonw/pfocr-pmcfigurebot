caption: 'MP infection induces cytokine expression and ER stress. (a) TNF-α and IL-8
  production were measured using ELISA assay after MP treatment (107 CFU/106 cells)
  for 12, 24, and 48 h in A549 cells. (b) PERK, ATF6, and IRE1α mRNA levels were measured
  using real-time PCR. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. control; #P < 0.05,
  ###P < 0.001 vs. 12 h; ++P < 0.01 vs. 24 h.'
