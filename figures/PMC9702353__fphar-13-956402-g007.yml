caption: 'FLaAN/C attenuated NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis in EAE mice. (A) Abundance
  of caspase-1 p20, GSDMD-N, and IL-18 and IL-1β proteins in mouse spinal cord. (B–C)
  The mRNA expression of Caspase-1 (B) and GSDMD (C) were quantitated by qRT-PCR.
  (D) Caspase-1 activity in mouse spinal cord was detected using the kit. (E) Detection
  of NLRP3 and ASC complex formation in spinal cord by co-immunoprecipitation. (F–G)
  Representative images of NLRP3+(F) and ASC+(G) in CD11b+ cells in sections of paraffin-embedded
  spinal cord tissue (scale bars: 50 μm). Data are shown as means ± SD (n = 6 per
  group). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001.
  * vs. Control group; # vs. MOG group.'
