  of cultured age-discriminatory and WLZ-associated bacteria strains that colonized
  gnotobiotic mice
caption: 'Cecal contents collected at the end of the experiment described in  were
  analyzed. (a,b) UHPLC-QqQ-MS-based quantitation of levels of total arabinose (panel
  a) and arabinose-containing glycosidic linkages (panel b) in cecal glycans collected
  at P53. Abbreviations: Araf, arabinofuranose; Arap, arabinopyranose; Xylp, xylopyranose.
  Each dot represents an individual animal (n=5-8 mice/treatment arm). Mean values
  ± SD are shown. P-values were calculated by the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by
  post-hoc Dunn’s test with Bonferroni correction for panels a and b. (c) PCA of profiles
  of normalized meta-transcriptomic counts (see ). Centroids are denoted by a colored
  “X” for each group. P-values were calculated by PERMANOVA. (d) MTXmodel abundance-normalized
  differential expression analysis of genes involved in specific carbohydrate utilization
  and amino acid biosynthetic pathways in the four arabinose-utilizing bacteria. Violin
  plots show the distribution of log2 fold-differences for all expressed genes with
  metabolic pathway annotations in the indicated organism. Dots in panel d represent
  differential expression test results for individual genes involved in the corresponding
  pathway and are colored if their Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted P-value is less than
  0.1. Abbreviations: BCAA, branched-chain amino acid; Glu, glutamate; Gln, glutamine.'
