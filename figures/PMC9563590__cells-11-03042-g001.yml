caption: Detailed schematic diagram of Nrf2-related signaling pathway. Structural
  characteristics of Nrf2 (A) and Keap1 (B). The spatial patterns of interaction between
  Nrf2 and Keap1 under physiological conditions (C) and stressful conditions (D).
  The degradation of Nrf2 depends on different proteins under different conditions.
  Under physiological conditions, it depends on Keap1 (C); under stressful conditions,
  it depends on GSK-3 (E). Ub, ubiquitin; P, Phosphorylation; SUMO, small ubiquitin-like
  modifiers, SUMOylation; Ac, acetylation.
