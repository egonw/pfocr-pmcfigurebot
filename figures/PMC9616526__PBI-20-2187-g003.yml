caption: Delivery of Sg2204 into wheat suppressed plant defence. (a) Phenotypes of
  wheat leaves inoculated with MgCl2 buffer (mock), Pseudomonas fluorescens EtHAn
  carrying pEDV6 (empty vector, EV), pEDV6:Sg2204 and pEDV6:AvrRpt2 (positive control)
  at 72 h after infiltration. (b) DAB staining for H2O2 accumulation in wheat leaves
  infiltrated with MgCl2 buffer, P. fluorescens EtHAn carrying EV, pEDV6:Sg2204 and
  pEDV6:AvrRpt2 at 72 h after infiltration. (c) Callose deposition observed by fluorescence
  microscopy in wheat leaves infiltrated with MgCl2 buffer, P. fluorescens EtHAn carrying
  EV, pEDV6:Sg2204 and pEDV6:AvrRpt2 at 72 h after infiltration after aniline blue
  staining. Bars = 200 μm. (d) H2O2 content of wheat leaves inoculated with MgCl2
  buffer, EV, pEDV6:Sg2204 or pEDV6:AvrRpt2. (e) Average number of callose deposits/mm2
  in wheat leaves treated with MgCl2 buffer, EV, pEDV6:Sg2204 or pEDV6:AvrRpt2. Three
  biological replicates were performed for each treatment. Data are presented as the
  mean ± SE. Different lowercase letters above the bars indicate significant differences
  among groups (one‐way ANOVA followed by Duncan's multiple range tests, P < 0.05).
  (f) The expression levels of JA synthesis‐related genes FAD and LOX in wheat leaves
  after infiltration with P. fluorescens EtAnH carrying an empty vector (EV) or pEDV6:Sg2204
  at 72 h. (g) The expression levels of the SA synthesis‐related gene PAL and the
  SA signalling pathway marker gene PR1 in wheat leaves after infiltration with an
  empty vector (EV) or pEDV6:Sg2204 at 72 h. (h) Change in endogenous JA contents
  in wheat leaves treated with P. fluorescens EtAnH carrying an empty vector (EV)
  or pEDV6:Sg2204. (i) Change in endogenous SA contents in wheat leaves inoculated
  with P. fluorescens EtAnH carrying an empty vector (EV) or pEDV6:Sg2204. Three biological
  replicates were performed for each treatment. Data are presented as the mean ± SE.
  Asterisks above the bars indicate significant differences between controls and treatments
  (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; Student's t test).
