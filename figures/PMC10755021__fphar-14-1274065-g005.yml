caption: Same as  showing two downstream pathways originating from the same receptor
  (A) together with semi-log concentration-response curves (B1, B2), fractional response
  versus occupancy curves (C1, C2), and a bias plot (D) but with response along the
  second pathways being right-shifted compared to occupancy (Î³ P2 = 0.15 < 1.0) to
  highlight that in this case, even balanced agonist can produce very little activity
  in this pathway if they are weak partial agonists (CpdTst3). Note that even in the
  bias plot (D), this weak balanced agonist (green) looks more like the biased agonist
  (red) than the balanced full agonist (blue).
