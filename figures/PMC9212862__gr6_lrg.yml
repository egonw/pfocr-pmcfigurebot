caption: 'Inhalation of PFTU@DEX NPs inhibited ROS-NLRP3 signaling pathway and promoted
  M2-type differentiation of macrophages. Bioluminescence images of mice being injected
  with L-012 probe (represents the expression of ROS, 50 µg/g) in vivo (A) and lung
  ex vivo (B) after different treatments (n = 4). (C) Western blotting of NLRP3, caspase1,
  IL‐1β-pro and IL‐1β in lung tissues after treatment with various formulations. The
  NLRP3, caspase1, IL‐1β-pro and IL‐1β expression levels are normalized against tubulin
  (n = 4). (D) Expression of intracellular iNOS (M1 macrophage marker) and Arg-1 (M2
  macrophage marker) in lung macrophages after being treated with various formulations
  analyzed by flow cytometry (n = 5). The dotted horizontal line represents the mean
  of PFTU@DEX NPs group. ANOVA followed by Tukey-test. Data are expressed as mean
  ± SD. *P < 0.05, ⁎⁎P < 0.01 vs LPS group. &P < 0.05, &&P < 0.01 vs DEX group. #P
  < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 vs PFTU NPs group.'
