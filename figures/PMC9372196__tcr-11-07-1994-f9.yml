caption: 'GO and KEGG functional pathways for DEmRNAs in UCEC. The GO chord (A: CPTAC,
  B: TCGA) for top 30 DEmRNAs and their GO terms. The GO circle (C: CPTAC, D: TCGA)
  and the outer circle represented the expression (|log2 FC|) of DEmRNAs in each enriched
  GO terms. To be specific, red dots on respective GO term indicated the up-regulated
  DEmRNAs. Blue dots indicated the down-regulated DEmRNAs. The inner circle represented
  the significance of GO terms (log10-adjusted P values). The bar plot (E: CPTAC,
  F: TCGA) and dot plot (G: CPTAC, H: TCGA) of 10 pathways lncRNA-related DEmRNAs
  from KEGG pathway analyses. For the bar plot, color intensity represented the significance
  of ranked functional pathways top to bottom while the horizontal axis represents
  the enriched mRNAs. For the dot plot, the bubble size was ordered by the number
  of enriched mRNAs and the color from red to blue also represented its significance.
