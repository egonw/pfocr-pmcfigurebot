caption: 'MOB1 acetylation regulates lung cancer progression. (A–D) H1299 cells stably
  expressing Vector, FLAG-MOB1 (WT or K11R mutant) were injected into axillas of nude
  mice and the xenograft tumors were dissevered at the day 35. All tumor masses were
  illustrated in (A). The size of tumors were evaluated and recorded every 2 days,
  from day 17 when tumors formed (B). The ultimate volume (C) and weight (D) were
  measured simultaneously after surgery at day 35, which were shown as mean ± SEM
  in histogram. According to one-way ANOVA, *is for P< 0.05 and ** is for P< 0.01.
  (E and F) Immunohistochemical stain was performed using AcK11-MOB1 Ab and representative
  images of normal lung tissues (upper part) and lung adenocarcinoma tissues, including
  strongly stained group (middle part) and weakly stained group (bottom part), were
  displayed in figure (E). The lower right corner of each image was magnified locally;
  scale bar: 50 μm, n = 85 (E). Levels of MOB1-K11 acetylation in normal lung tissues
  and lung adenocarcinoma tissues were statistically analyzed and exhibited as mean ± SEM
  in column diagrams. According to Mann–Whitney test, **** is for P< 0.0001 (F). (G)
  Kaplan–Meier analysis was accomplished in low MOB1-K11 acetylation group (n = 55)
  and high acetylation group (n = 30). According to Log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test, P
  value is 0.0459 for *, n = 85. (H) A working model of MOB1 acetylation in the Hippo
  signaling pathway.'
