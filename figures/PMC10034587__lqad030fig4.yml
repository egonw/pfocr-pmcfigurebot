caption: Study and illustrations of complex multi-subunits IL1RAP signaling pathways
  for COVID versus control samples using DiSiR from lung scRNA-seq data. (A) Heatmap
  plot illustrating the differences between cell–cell communications identified by
  DiSiR for the IL1RAP signaling pathway between COVID-19 and control samples in lung
  scRNA-seq data. The colormap shows the strength of interaction between the cell
  types. Chord diagram representation of significant ligand–receptor interactions,
  involved in the IL1RAP signaling pathway, e.g. IL1A|IL1RAP + IL1A|IL1R1, IL1B|IL1RAP
  + IL1B|IL1R1, IL1RN|IL1RAP + IL1RN|IL1RL1, IL33|IL1RAP + IL33|IL1RL1, IL36B|IL1RAP
  + IL36B|IL1RL2, IL36G|IL1RAP + IL36G|IL1RL2 and IL36RN|IL1RAP + IL36RN|IL1RL2, between
  different cell types identified by DiSiR for (B) healthy versus (C) COVID samples
  using the default threshold level (Th= 0).
