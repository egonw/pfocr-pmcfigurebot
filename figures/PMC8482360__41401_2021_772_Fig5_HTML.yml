figure_title: Hypomethylated DMRs within the promoter region along with downregulated
  mRNA expression of genes clustered in Gβγ signaling exists in both the F2 thoracic
  aorta and F1 sperm of PIE LPS-P offspring
caption: a Validation of the mRNA expression by qPCR in genes clustered in Gβγ signaling
  pathway in the thoracic aorta of F2 LPS-P offspring relative to control offspring.
  Each dot represents one rat. b, c Validation of DMRs in genes clustered in Gβγ signaling
  pathway identified in aortic MeDIP-Seq data by bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) in
  both the thoracic aorta of F2 offspring (b) and in the sperm of F1 offspring (c).
  BSP results were expressed as a percentage of DNA methylation in each sequence,
  detailed in Supplementary Figs.  and  for a and b, respectively.
