caption: CCDC-PA inhibited the Akt phosphorylation in HSC-3 and SCC4 cells treated
  with CCDC-PA at various stoichiometric ratios for 24 h. Protein lysates were subjected
  to Western blot analysis, and β-actin was used as the loading control (data not
  shown). The protein expression of Akt, JNK, MEK, Erk, and p38 as well as their phosphorylated
  forms were observed in (A) HSC-3 and (B) SCC4 cells. The quantification of p-Akt/Akt,
  p-JNK/JNK, p-MEK/MEK, p-Erk/Erk, and p-p38/p38 ratios was further done by densitometry
  analysis in (A) HSC-3 and (B) SCC4 cells. Control indicates a condition without
  treatment of CCDC-PA. 1:20, 1:10, 1:5 1:2, and 1:1 indicate the final concentration
  of PA in the CCDC system is equivalent to 2.5, 5.0, 10, 25, and 50 µg/mL respectively.
  The cropped images of blots shown in figures are used for illustrative purposes,
  full scan of the entire original gel(s) are included in the . Data are expressed
  as mean ± S.D. (n = 3), with *P< 0.05 indicating the significant difference from
  the controls.
