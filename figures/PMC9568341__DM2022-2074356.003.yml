caption: BMP2 is a target gene of miR-664a-3p. (a) Schematic representation of the
  predicted binding of miR-664a-3p to BMP2. Schematic diagram of the structure of
  the luciferase reporter system. (b) The relative luciferase activity of VICs coinfected
  with constructed luciferase reporters (BMP2-WT or BMP2-MUT) and miR-664a-3p mimic
  or inhibitor or negative control. (c) Western blotting analysis of BMP2 expression
  in VICs after alterations in the level of miR-664a-3p. Quantitative analysis of
  the protein bands are shown on the right. (d) Pearson's correlation analysis between
  BMP2 and miR-664a-3p in human CAVs (five dots in the red box) and human non-CAVs
  (five dots in the blue box). The horizontal and vertical coordinates indicate the
  mean Ct values of miR-664a-3p and BMP2 in RT-qPCR, respectively. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P
  < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
