figure_title: EZH2 inhibition by zld1039 preserved RKIP expression and inhibited the
  activation of NF-κB signaling in cisplatin-stimulated TCMK-1 cells
caption: a–f Protein expression levels of RKIP, p65, p-p65, IκBα, and p-IκBα were
  quantified by densitometry and normalized with GAPDH. ****P < 0.0001, ***P < 0.001.
  All Western blot analyses were performed in triplicate.
article_title: Selective EZH2 inhibitor zld1039 alleviates inflammation in cisplatin-induced
  acute kidney injury partially by enhancing RKIP and suppressing NF-κB p65 pathway.
