caption: PTP1B reduced activity impairs Cdk3 activation and induces cell cycle arrest
  in human GB cells. GB cells were synchronized at G0 by serum deprivation for 48 h
  and incubated 3 h with vehicle (A), claramine 2 µM (B), or trodusquemine 2 µM. Cell
  cycle arrest was released by the addition of 10% FBS and cells were collected at
  the indicated times. The activity of Cdk3 was assessed by immunoblot. GAPDH was
  used as loading control. (D) GB cells were synchronized at G0 and incubated 3 h
  with vehicle, claramine 2 µM or trodusquemine 2 µM as previously mentioned, or transfected
  with nontargeting siRNAs or siRNAs targeting PTP1B or Cdk3. Cell cycle arrest was
  released by the addition of 10% FBS, cells were fixed at indicated time points and
  stained with propidium iodide. Quantification of the percentage of cells at each
  phase is represented. Statistical differences between control and experimental groups
  of cells are indicated (*P < 0.05). Data are representative of three independent
  experiments.
