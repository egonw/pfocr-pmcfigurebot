caption: 'Interpretations from Gene Ontology enrichment analysis. (A) Gene ontology
  pathway-specific analysis: Each row represents the genes belonging to a particular
  pathway/biological process in the GO database. The dot color/size represents the
  difference in median expression between genes of a particular pathway and rest of
  genes in whole transcriptome. A positive value indicates up-regulation (blue) and
  a negative value indicates down-regulation (red). The difference was tested using
  Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test and statistically insignificant ones were denoted with
  crosses. Inflammatory response is down-regulated more strongly in P3 versus P0,
  which may reflect why the use of P3 stage cells does not cause fibrosis in corneal
  stromal transplants. The stronger down-regulation in ESC may reflect on the immune
  privilege of embryonic stem cells. The cell motility pathways are active in P3,
  cornea, and ESC. This is easily explained for the stromal stem cells in P3 and the
  ESC in terms of their proliferation and migration activity before differentiation,
  but for cornea may be representative of continuous cell migration required to replace
  lost corneal tissue. (B) The heatmap of 254 genes belonging to wound healing pathway.
  The rows indicate the genes and columns indicate the samples (cells or tissues).
  The color intensity represents the level of changes in expression. All significantly
  up-regulated genes are indicated in green and all significantly down-regulated genes
  are indicated in red. p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant change
  in the gene expression. (C,D) Genes of wound healing pathway exclusively expressed
  in LMSC−P3: The levels of COL5A1 and TIMP1 in LMSC−P0 and LMSC−P3 assessed through
  RNA-Seq (C) and qRT-PCR (D). The LMSC−P3 has ~10-fold (n = 3. p < 0.001) high expression
  of COL5A1, which was down-regulated in LMSC−P0, evident from both techniques. The
  levels of TIMP1 were ~6-fold high (n = 3, p < 0.001) and 4-fold higher (n = 5, p
  < 0.01) in LMSC−P3, when assessed through RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR respectively. ** p
  < 0.01, *** p < 0.001. The results were plotted as mean log 2-fold change ± SD.
  The statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal–Wallis one-way ANOVA test for
  qRT-PCR and two-tailed T test for RNA-Seq analysis.'
