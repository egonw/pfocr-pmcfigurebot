caption: 'Zinc promotes angiogenesis during cerebral ischemia repair. (A) CD31 staining
  was performed to observe the changes in vascular morphology in ischemic hemispheres
  and nonischemic hemispheres or zinc‐treated rats. (B) Representative images of immunofluorescence
  staining for CD31 (green), VEGF (red), and DAPI (blue). (C) Representative images
  of immunofluorescence staining for CD31 (red), BrdU (green), and DAPI (blue). (D)
  Quantitative analysis of the number of CD31/BrdU‐positive cells in ischemic hemispheres
  and nonischemic hemispheres or zinc‐treated rats. (Scale bars: 20 μm, field size:40 × 40 μm2),
  **p < 0.005. Data are expressed as mean ± SD (n = 3/group)'
