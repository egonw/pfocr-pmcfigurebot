caption: Altered auxin homeostasis in root under high and low temperature. Elongated
  root growth at high temperature (A). Meristematic region and representative epidermal
  cells (shaded in green color based on auxin level) are demonstrated (B) along with
  the direction of auxin flow and accumulation (C). High temperature-mediated PIN2-targeting
  to the plasma membrane (D). Inhibited root growth at low temperature (E). Meristematic
  region and representative epidermal cells (shaded in green color based on auxin
  level) are demonstrated (F) along with the direction of auxin flow and accumulation
  (F). Low temperature mediated PIN2 trafficking inhibition to the plasma membrane
  (H).
