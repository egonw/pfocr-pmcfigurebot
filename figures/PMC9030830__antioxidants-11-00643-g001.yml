caption: 'Rh1 inhibits VSMC migration promoted by Angiotensin II (Ang II). Cells were
  pretreated with Rh1 for 3 h, before treatment with 100 nM Ang II for 24 h. (A) Wound-healing
  assay indicates cell migration. The red lines indicate a clear zone after scratching
  (0 h). (B) The quantification of cell migration was carried out by Image J software.
  (C,D) Western blot analysis was used to analyze the expression levels of the indicated
  proteins in the cells. (B,D) Results are represented as means Â± SEM (n = 5), **
  p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001 compared with the control, ## p < 0.01 and ### p < 0.001
  compared with the Ang II-treated sample. GAPDH: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase,
  MMP: matrix metalloproteinase.'
