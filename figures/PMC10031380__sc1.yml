caption: Schematic illustration of TME pH-responsive mRNA delivery NP platform for
  the reversal of trastuzumab resistance and effective BCa therapy. In this NP platform,
  the amphiphilic cationic lipid-like compound G0-C14 could bind PTEN mRNA to form
  G0-C14/mRNA complexes (a), which could be then embedded into the hydrophobic cores
  of NPs made with the TME pH-responsive block copolymer Meo-PEG-Dlinkm-PLGA (b).
  After intravenous administration (c), the PTEN mRNA-loaded NPs could extravasate
  from leaky tumor vasculature and accumulate in the tumor tissue. With the TME pH-triggered
  detachment of PEG chains from the NP surface (d), the encapsulated PTEN mRNA could
  be efficiently internalized by trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive BCa cells (e,
  f), which could thus block the activity of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway via up-regulating
  PTEN expression (g), leading to the reversal of trastuzumab resistance (h) and significant
  inhibition of tumor growth of trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive BCa.
