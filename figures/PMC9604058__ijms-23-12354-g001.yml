caption: 'Expression analysis of MTERF1 protein in clinical tissues of CRC. (A,B)
  Western blotting analysis (A) and quantification (B) of MTERF1 expression in CRC
  tissues and paired adjacent normal tissues. P, paired adjacent normal tissues; C,
  CRC tissues. The diagonal line (B) connects the CRC tissues with paired adjacent
  normal tissues. GAPDH was used as an internal control. (C) Representative image
  of IHC staining of the expression of MTERF1 protein in clinical tumor tissues from
  CRC patients and corresponding adjacent tissues. Quantification of IHC is shown
  on the right. Scale bar: 100 μm. (D) Colorectal cancer TMAs that contain colon cancer
  tissues and paired adjacent normal tissues were stained with MTERF1 antibodies,
  and the quantification data for IHC are shown. Representative images with differential
  magnification of immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining are shown. Orange and green
  squares indicate higher magnification views of left regions boxed. Scale bar: 2000
  μm. * p <0.05, *** p <0.001 by two-tailed Student’s t-test. Data represent the mean
  ± SD from three independent biological replicates.'
