caption: (A) Schematic representation of the structure of KIT. (B) The homodimeric
  state of KIT brought about by SCF binding and stabilized by interactions between
  immunoglobulin-like domains. (C) Signaling pathways involving KIT. The MAPK pathway,
  JAK/STAT pathway, P13K pathway, and Src family kinase pathway are shown as orange,
  yellow, green, and blue lines, respectively.
