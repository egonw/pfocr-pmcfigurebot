caption: The potential mechanisms by which THI supplementation attenuates LPS-induced
  inflammation and energy metabolism disturbance in goats. The dietary change from
  forage to high concentrate (HC) diets causes low pH in the rumen, which thus results
  in LPS accumulation and thiamine deficiency. On the one hand, thiamine supplementation
  suppresses the ruminal epithelium inflammatory response by suppressing the p38 MAPK
  signaling pathway mediates inactivation of the NFκB factor. On the other hand, thiamine
  supplementation protects mitochondrial function, regulates activation of the AMPK
  pathway and thereby promotes ATP production, which may inhibit cell apoptosis. In
  addition, thiamine supplementation modulates energy metabolism disturbance and lipopolysaccharide-induced
  inflammation that may be related to the interaction effect between the AMPK and
  p38 MAPK signal pathway.
