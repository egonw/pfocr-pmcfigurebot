caption: Phosphoproteomic analysis of liver identifies EGFR signaling as a potential
  mediator of inflammatory disease response. (A–C) The phosphoproteome of the same
  liver samples (n = 5/time per condition) was analyzed by mass spectrometry. Principle
  component analysis identified disease as the largest source of variation (A; naïve
  mice, blue; CIA mice, red). Significantly altered phosphopeptides (B, blue), predominantly
  serine residues (C), were identified. (D–F) Differential rhythmicity analysis using
  compareRhythms (D and E) highlighting a switch in predicted phase for phosphopeptides
  belonging to the “altered” group (F). (G) Groups of genes associated with sites
  of DP and/or rhythmic phosphorylation were analyzed for functional enrichment using
  the Enrichr tool (spot size represents fold enrichment of genes in group vs. the
  genome; color represents significance of enrichment; spot absence means no genes
  from the pathway belonged to the group), highlighting enrichment of genes involved
  in EGFR/IL6 signaling. (H) The KinSwingR package was used to predict kinases associated
  with significant (FDR < 0.05) phosphoproteome changes (increased phosphorylation
  with CIA indicated in red; reduced phosphorylation indicated in blue), also highlighting
  EGFR signaling. (I) Among predicted regulatory kinases, Stat3 showed DP. Treatment
  effect by two-way ANOVA. ****P < 0.0001. Error bars represent SEM. (J) Western blot
  analysis of phospho-Stat3, Stat3 (Top), phospho-EGFR and EGFR (Bottom) confirmed
  increased phosphorylation in CIA liver samples collected at ZT4. GAPDH immunoblot
  was used as a loading control.
