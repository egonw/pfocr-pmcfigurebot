caption: Biofilm development of S. oneidensis MR-1 correlates with the turn off of
  arginine synthesis and the turn on of glutamine synthesis. (A) Intracellular glutamine
  concentration in Q19, R19, or in the H-NS wild-type strain cultured in LB medium.
  (B) Schematic of the arginine and glutamine synthesis pathway in S. oneidensis MR-1.
  (C) Schematic representation of the gene operons involved in arginine synthesis
  and transportation. (D) Transcription of argA, argC, artQ, and glnA in pellicle
  and attached biofilm cells compared with stationary phase cells. Expression of the
  16S ribosomal RNA gene rrsE was used to normalize the total RNA in different samples.
  (E) Biofilm formation of the MR-1 wild-type strain using NH4Cl, arginine, or glutamine
  as the sole nitrogen source. (F) Quantification of attached biofilm formation of
  the MR-1 wild-type and ΔglnA strains that cultured in minimal medium supplemented
  with NH4Cl or glutamine (5 or 10 mM). For A and D, F, error bars indicate one standard
  error of the mean across a minimum of three biological replicates. One asterisk
  indicates the significance of P < 0.05.
