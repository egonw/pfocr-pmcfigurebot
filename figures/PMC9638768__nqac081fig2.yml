caption: Metabolic pathways that differed (q < 0.25) between MOM and formula group
  in pathways related to (A) biosynthesis, (B) degradation/utilization/assimilation,
  and (C) precursor metabolites and energy. Differences calculated using MaASLin2.
  Model included the pathways and corrected GA as fixed effects, and infant as random
  effect. Analyses included 42 stool samples (21 in each group) from 27 infants. GA,
  gestational age; MaASLin2, Microbiome Multivariable Association Linear Models; MOM,
  mother's own milk; PWY, pathway; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.

  mother''s own milk with bovine milk–based fortifier or infant formula: a cross-sectional
  study.'
