caption: 'POMC is selectively cleaved by FURIN at the C-terminal site of ACTH (KR164↓)
  into proACTH and β-lipotropin (LPH) in ΔFurHEK293T cells. Western blot analysis
  of POMC and each co-transfected PCs in cell lysate (A–B) and proACTH and ACTH in
  medium (C) of Furin-deficient HEK293T cells co-transfected with POMC and different
  PCs. The blot in A (upper panel) is labeled with an anti-myc antibody. The lower
  panel shows a ponceau S-staining of the cell lysates as loading reference. (B) Western
  blot analysis of each transfected PC detected either in the medium or in the cell
  lysate. As negative control was used medium or cell lysate from ΔFurHEK293T transfected
  with a different PC. The blot in C is labeled with the A2A3 antibody directed against
  the free carboxy-terminus of ACTH. One minute-exposure of the entire blot (upper
  panel), and 5 min-exposure of the lower part of the blot (lower panel) to show the
  less abundant low MW ACTH forms. Mouse pituitary protein extract (25 μg) was used
  as positive control (first lane). (D) Metabolic labeling of Furin-deficient HEK293T
  cells transfected with POMC alone or together with FURIN (40 min pulse). (E) New
  model for POMC processing in hypothalamus. The antibody used to detect POMC-myc
  is depicted in blue, and in orange the antibody used to detect proACTH and ACTH
  (glycosylated: gACTH, and mature: mACTH). In ΔFurHEK293T cells lacking the secretory
  pathway, FURIN preferentially cleaves the first POMC cleavage site, most likely
  in the TGN. The same cleavages are mediated by PC1/3 in cells with a regulated secretory
  pathway probably requiring the pH conditions of the ISGs. Cleavage of proACTH to
  ACTH is performed by PC1/3, the enzymes providing redundancy are probably FURIN
  and/or PC2. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend,
  the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)'
