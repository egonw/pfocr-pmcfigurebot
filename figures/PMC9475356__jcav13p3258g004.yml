caption: 'Effects of β-CCE on PRDX family proteins and MAPK signalling pathway in
  HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells were pre-treated with NAC for 30 min and subsequently treated
  with β-CCE (80 μg/mL) for 24 h. (A) The expression of PRDX family proteins in HepG2
  cells of each treatment group (Con, β-CCE, and NAC+β-CCE) was detected by western
  blotting. (B) Quantitative analysis of PRDX (I-VI) protein expression level. (C)
  The expression of ERK, JNK, P38, and their phosphorylated proteins (p-ERK, p-JNK,
  and p-P38) in HepG2 cells of each treatment group (Con, β-CCE, NAC+β-CCE) was detected
  by western blotting. (D-F) Quantitative analysis of (D) p-ERK, (E) p-JNK, and (F)
  p-P38 expression levels. *** represents the difference between β-CCE and Con groups,
  ### represents the difference between β-CCE and NAC+β-CCE groups (**p < 0.01, ***p
  < 0.001, ###p < 0.001).'
