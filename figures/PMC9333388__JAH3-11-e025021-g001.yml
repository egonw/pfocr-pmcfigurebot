figure_title: RNA‐sequence analysis of heart tissues from Ctrl and cKO mice after
  TAC surgery for 4 weeks
caption: A, Volcano plot of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The red dots
  represent genes upregulated in cKO mice, the green dots represent genes downregulated
  in cKO mice, and the blue dots represent non‐differentially expressed genes. B,
  Gene ontology (GO) analysis of the DEGs indicated that, compared with the Ctrl mice,
  the different gene profile predominantly clustered into extracellular matrix in
  the cKO mice. C, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that pathways associated
  with PI3K/AKT signaling pathway were the most enriched by DEGs. D, Heatmap of the
  DEGs related to PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. The map is color coded with red corresponding
  to upregulation and blue to downregulation. E through L, Independent qRT‐PCR validation
  of Ccnd1 (E), Col4α2 (F), Spp1 (G), Lpar1 (H), Thbs4 (I) and Fgf23 (J), Fgf10 (K),
  IL2rb (L) expression in heart tissues from Ctrl and cKO mice. n=3 to 8 mice per
  group. BP, biological process; CC, cell component; cKO, cardiomyocyte‐specific Bmal1
  knockout mice; Ctrl, control mice; MF, molecular function; NO, no difference; and
  TAC, transverse aortic constriction. Data were presented as mean±SEM, *P<0.05, **P<0.01,
  ***P<0.001.
