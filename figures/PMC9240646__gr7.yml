caption: Molecular mechanism behind the generation of diverse LCB chain lengths. The
  biosynthetic pathway of each ceramide class and the proteins involved in each reaction
  step are shown. In the de novo ceramide synthesis pathway, SPT complexes catalyze
  the condensation of acyl-CoA with serine to produce KDS. The four SPT complexes
  produce KDSs with different chain lengths, as shown in the dotted box. Next, KDS
  is converted to DS and condensed with acyl-CoA (N-, A-, or O-type) by CERS, generating
  DS-type ceramides. These are converted to S- and P-type ceramides by DEGS1 and DEGS2,
  respectively. SD-type ceramides are produced by FADS3, which desaturates the C14
  position of the LCB moiety in S-type ceramides. H-type ceramides are generated by
  an unidentified enzyme, which is assumed to hydroxylate the C6 position of the LCB
  moiety in S-type ceramides. O-type ceramides are converted to acylceramides (EO-type
  ceramides), and some acylceramides are metabolized to protein-bound ceramides (P-O-type
  ceramides) via several reactions, including ALOX12B-, ALOXE3-, and SDR9C7-mediated
  reactions. We divided all ceramide classes into five groups (color coded) based
  on their LCB chain-length distribution patterns. The enzyme names of the proteins
  presented in the figure are listed in the box at the bottom of the figure.
