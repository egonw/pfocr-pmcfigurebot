caption: 'Periplocin-induced autophagy is dependent on AMPK/MTOR signaling. (a, b)
  After 24 h of periplocin treatment (125 nM, 250 nM). The expression of AMPK/MTOR
  signaling pathway proteins detected by Western blotting analysis. (c, d) Expression
  of LC3BII/I of CFPAC1 and PANC-1 cells after treatment with 125 nM periplocin and/or
  5 μM CC detected by Western blotting analysis. (e) Expression of LC3B of CFPAC1
  and PANC-1 cells after treatment with 125 nM periplocin and/or 5 μM CC detected
  by immunofluorescence. The data represent the mean ± SE, with ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗∗P <
  0.001, ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001 compared between two groups and #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 and
  ####P < 0.0001 compared with the group treated with Periplocin and CC (n = 3).'
