caption: The ATP‐P2X7 pathway regulated the hepatic PANX1–IL‐33 axis in endotoxemia
  in vivo. (A) Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations in liver tissue interstitial
  fluid from wild‐type (WT) and Panx1−/− mice at 24 h after injection with 15 mg/kg
  lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (n = 5 mice per group). (B) mRNA levels of P2xs in wild‐type
  (WT) and Panx1−/− mice at 24 h after injection with 15 mg/kg LPS (n = 4 per group).
  (C) Quantification of IHC staining for P2Xs in liver tissue samples from WT and
  Panx1−/− mice at 24 h after injection with 15 mg/kg LPS. The quantified results
  are the average of 10 images per mouse (n = 5 mice per group). (D–F) Immunoblots
  and quantifications of P2X7 and PANX1 expression in the liver and kidney of WT mice
  treated with adeno‐associated virus (AAV)‐Panx1‐shRNA, AAV‐P2x7‐shRNA or both at
  2 weeks. (G) Survival (n = 6 mice per group) and (H) serum alanine aminotransferase
  (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels (n = 5 mice per group) of control
  mice and mice treated with AAV‐P2x7‐shRNA, AAV‐Panx1‐shRNA, or both at 24 h after
  injection with 15 mg/kg LPS. (I and J) Representative images of hematoxylin and
  eosin staining and pathology scoring (scale bar = 50 μm) (n = 5 mice per group).
  (K and L) Representative images and quantification of IHC staining of IL‐33 in the
  liver tissue samples of control mice and mice treated with AAV‐P2x7‐shRNA, AAV‐Panx1‐shRNA,
  or both at 24 h after injection with 15 mg/kg LPS. The quantified results are the
  average of 10 images per mouse (scale bar = 50 μm) (n = 5 mice per group). **p < 0.01
  and ***p < 0.001 by Student's t‐test or ANOVA
