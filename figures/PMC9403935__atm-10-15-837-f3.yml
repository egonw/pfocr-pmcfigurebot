caption: T cells undergo phenotypic and state reprogramming of the psoriasis microenvironment.
  (A) The proportion difference of FOXP3+ Treg cells and CTLA4+ CD8 T cells between
  psoriasis and normal skins. (B) The phenotypic difference of T cells between psoriasis
  and normal skins. (C) Pathway enrichment analysis of T cells between psoriasis and
  normal skins. (D) The trajectory of T cell subsets (CTLA4+ CD8 T cells, GZMB+ CD8
  T cells, GZMK+ CD8 T cells, and naive CD8 T cells). *, P<0.05; ***, P<0.005. Treg,
