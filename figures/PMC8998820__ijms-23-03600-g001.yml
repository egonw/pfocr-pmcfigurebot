caption: 'Natterin induces neutrophilic inflammation dependent on PRRs and GPR91 sensors.
  Natterin (1 μg diluted in PBS) was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) in non-treated
  WT mice (WT_Natterin) or deficient in tlr2/tlr4, myd88 or trif (A) or gpr91 KO mice
  (B) (KO_Natterin groups). As a negative control, mice were only injected i.p. with
  PBS (WT_PBS). An independent group of WT mice were pre-treated 1 h before Natterin
  injection with i.p. injection of 2-DG at 10 mg/Kg (WT 2-DG_Natterin, (C). Two hours
  after injection, mice were killed and the peritoneal cavities were washed to obtain
  exudates. Peritoneal exudate cells were harvested and the number of macrophages
  (large leukocytes with a blue-grey ground glass cytoplasm and an irregularly shaped
  nucleus with vacuoles.) and neutrophils (with 3–5 nuclear lobes and fine granules
  within the cytoplasm) was evaluated in cytospin slides stained with a Diff-Quick
  staining kit. Examples of representative photomicrographs are shown in (D). Each
  bar represents the mean ± SEM of 3–5 animals/group. * p < 0.05 compared with WT_PBS
  group and # p < 0.05 compared with WT_Natterin-group.'
