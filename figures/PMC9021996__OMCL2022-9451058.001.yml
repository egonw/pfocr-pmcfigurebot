caption: 'EPA exerts antiatherosclerotic and anti-inflammatory effects in vivo. (a)
  Schematic depiction of the study in which ApoE−/− mice were fed a HFD for 12 weeks
  and treated with PBS or EPA starting at week 3. (b) Gross ORO staining of the aortas
  (n = 5 per group). (c) Aortic slices after ORO staining of mice treated with EPA
  (n = 5 per group). (d) Serological TC, TG, LDL-C, and HDL-C levels (n = 6-9). (e)
  IHC of mouse aortic roots: IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels (n = 5 per group). (f)
  Serological MCP-1 levels (n = 5-9). (g) Serological CRP level (n = 10-14). (h) Serological
  level of MDA (n = 7-9). (i) Serological level of GPx (n = 5 per group). The data
  are presented as the mean ± SEM. ∗p < 0.05,  ∗∗p < 0.01, and∗∗∗p < 0.001.'
