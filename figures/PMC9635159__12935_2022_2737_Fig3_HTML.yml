caption: 'Agarose gel electrophoresis of methylation specific PCR products: In all
  subfigures first lane represents 100 bp ladder, next two lane methylated tumour
  and normal PCR products and proceeding two lanes are unmethylated tumour and normal
  PCR products. A Representative agarose gel images for the methylation status of
  pathway enriched loci namely KCNA6 (M:145 bp,U:147 bp), RASSF1 (M:193 bp,U:197 bp)and
  SIGIRR (M:192 bp,U:192 bp). B Representative agarose gel images for the differential
  promoter methylation status of FAIM2(M:278 bp,U:286 bp), NPY(M:264 bp,U:266 bp)
  and FOXE1(M:275 bp,U:277 bp). For each subset the same patient’s tumour and normal
  has been used. C Percentage of methylation in cancer and normal samples was shown
  in bar graph. Triple independent validation of the respective methylation status
  of above genes across all 22 (Adjacent tumour and normal) paired samples were done
  by Agarose gel electrophoresis of methylation specific PCR products. “M” represents
  methylated PCR product; “U” represents, unmethylated PCR products; “N” represents
  Adjacent Normal Sample; “T” represents Tumour sample'
