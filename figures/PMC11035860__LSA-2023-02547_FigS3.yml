figure_title: CRISPR/Cas9 gene targeting and inferred gene essentiality in cancer
  cells exemplify porphyrin overdrive
caption: A total of over 300 cancer cell lines from 27 major cancer types are analyzed.
  The dataset represents 18 human tissue types that give rise to diverse groups of
  cancer. Whole-genome loss-of-function growth phenotypes show most cancer cells only
  require a partial heme biosynthetic pathway to survive. Gene essentiality is estimated
  from gene X dependency inferred from CRISPR/Cas9 gRNA gene X KO. Low cell viability
  and high cell viability with deletion of gene X indicate that the cancer cells have
  a high and low dependence on gene X for survival, respectively. Thus, the lowest
  and highest gene essentiality values are associated with the least and most profound
  dependence of the cells on the loss of gene X, respectively. The UROD gene for the
  fifth enzyme of the pathway has the highest essentiality in all types of cancers,
  whereas genes encoding other enzymes are dispensable in many cancer cell lines.
  Each of the rows in the 18 human tissue panels represents a distinct cancer cell
  line for the pertinent tissue (ABCG2, ATP-binding cassette [ABC] transporter subfamily
  G, member 2; ALAD, ALA dehydratase [aka porphobilinogen synthase]; ALAS1, 5-aminolevulinate
  synthase 1; CPOX, coproporphyrinogen oxidase; FECH, ferrochelatase; FLVCR, feline
  leukemia virus subgroup C receptor family; HMBS, hydroxymethylbilane synthase; PPOX,
  protoporphyrinogen oxidase; SLC48A1, solute carrier family 48, member 1, a.k.a.
  heme transporter HRG1; UROD, uroporphyrinogen III decarboxylase; UROS, uroporphyrinogen
  III synthase).
