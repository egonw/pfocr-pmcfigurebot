figure_title: Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) reveals targeted GABAergic cell
  types have similar responses in Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and fatal familial insomnia
caption: (A) GSEA results for selected GO Biological Process terms and KEGG pathways.
  Extended plot in . Consensus scores were calculated based on results from GSEA methods
  providing gene set statistics for distinct up- and down-regulated gene sets, represented
  by upward and downward arrowheads, respectively. Selected terms with FDR ≤0.05 in
  at least three of the six applied GSEA methods and a consensus rank of ≤5 are displayed.
  The gene ratio indicates the proportion of genes changed in the indicated direction
  relative to the total number of genes in the set. For visualization, GO terms were
  collapsed based on semantic similarity (method = “Resnik,” threshold = 0.8) to reduce
  redundancy. This resulted in GO results in some cases displaying metrics for several
  gene sets summarized under the listed parent term. (B) Comparison of terms occurring
  in one or both disease models by cell type suggested cerebellar Gad2+, SST+, and
  PV+ neurons show similar responses between both disease models, whereas cerebellar
  vGluT2+ neurons show the most terms changed in one disease and either unchanged
  or changed in the opposite directions, suggesting a more disease-specific response.
  Plot shows the number of pathway or collapsed (parent) terms which were up- or down-regulated
  in only one disease and unchanged in the other (unique, blue or red), occurred in
  both diseases but with mixed or opposing directionalities (orange) or were shared
  between diseases showing the same directionality (light green).
