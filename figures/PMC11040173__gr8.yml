caption: Ferroptosis affected the differentiation of ISCs and inhibited Notch signaling
  pathway. C57BL/6J mice were intraperitoneally injected with saline (Control) or
  25 mg/kg body weight of erastin, a classical inducer of ferroptosis, respectively
  for 2 d at 12-h intervals. (A–B) Representative images of OLFM4 and Ki67 by immunofluorescence
  (Upper panel: × 200 magnification. Lower panel: × 400 magnification) in the duodenum.
  (C) Representative images of Goblet cells by PAS staining (Upper panel: × 200 magnification.
  Lower panel: × 400 magnification) in the duodenum. (D) Quantitative analysis for
  OLFM4-positive ISCs, Ki67-positive cells, and PAS-positive goblet cells in the duodenum
  (n = 6). (E) The mRNA expression levels of Notch related proteins (Dll1, Dll4, Notch1,
  RBP-Jκ and Atoh1) in the duodenum (n = 6). (F) Representative images of NICD by
  immunofluorescence (Upper panel: × 200 magnification. Lower panel: × 400 magnification)
  in the duodenum. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01 compared with the control group.
