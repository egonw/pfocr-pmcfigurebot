caption: BMSCs-EVs inhibited the growth of OS in mice. After the xenograft model of
  OS was established, the OS mice were treated with BMSC-EVs. A-C) The growth rate,
  volume, and weight of tumors were decreased. D) Immunohistochemistry showed that
  the proliferation (Ki-67) of tumor cells was decreased. E-F) RT-qPCR demonstrated
  that the expressions of miR-206 was increased and NRSN2 mRNA was decreased. G) WB
  demonstrated that the expressions of p-ERK1/2, ERK1/2 and Bcl-xL, and levels of
  the ratio of p- ERK1/2:ERK1/2 and Bcl-xL protein were decreased were detected by
  WB; n=6; the data were expressed as mean Â± SD. Independent t-test was used for comparison
  among groups; **p<0.01.
