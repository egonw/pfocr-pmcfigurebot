caption: Relative expression of ITGA5 in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines. (a).
  mRNA RNA sequencing of gastric cancer tissues and corresponding paracancerous normal
  groups identified a total of 2625 differentially expressed genes. (b). Volcano plot
  showing 2307 upregulated genes and 318 downregulated genes among the differentially
  expressed genes, with the red color representing the upregulated genes and the green
  color representing the downregulated genes. (c). Log FC>2 as the criterion to screen
  out significantly differentially expressed integrin family member profiles, among
  which ITGA5 expression differential fold was the largest. (d) RNA sequence screened
  out ITGA5 expression in gastric cancer tissues versus the corresponding paracancerous
  normal tissues (N = 10). mRNA expression level of ITGA5 was significantly upregulated
  in gastric cancer tissues (P < 0.001). (e) ITGA5 expression in 40 gastric cancer
  tissues and corresponding paraneoplastic tissues by qRT-PCR. ITGA5 mRNA expression
  was significantly upregulated in gastric cancer tissues (P < 0.001). (f) ITGA5 mRNA
  expression in 408 gastric cancer tissues and 36 corresponding paraneoplastic tissues
  by TCGA database. ITGA5 mRNA is highly expressed in tumor tissues. (g–h) ITGA5 protein
  expression in gastric cancer tissues and corresponding paracancerous normal tissues
  determined by Western blot. ITGA5 expression in most gastric cancer tissues was
  higher than that in paracancerous tissues using GAPDH as a loading control (N =
  12, P = 0.005). (i–j) ITGA5 expression in three gastric cancer tissues and three
  gastric cancer cell lines determined by qRT-PCR (i) and Western blot (j). ITGA5
  mRNA and protein expression were upregulated in gastric cancer cells compared with
  its expression in the normal gastric mucosal epithelial cell line Ges-1. The high
  expression of ITGA5 in gastric cancer was found in high-throughput sequencing and
  bioinformatics databases, and this result was verified in clinical samples and gastric
  cancer cell lines.
