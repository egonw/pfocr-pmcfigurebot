caption: KEGG pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) functional analysis for DEGs upregulated
  in FAI and OA. (A) Distinct KEGG signaling pathways were identified in the cartilage
  between FAI and OA patients. (B, C) GO functional analysis showing collagen catabolic
  process, extracellular matrix disassembly, and proteolysis GO terms were enriched
  in OA patients, while several muscle- and contractile-element-associated GO terms
  were observed in FAI patients. DEG, differentially expressed gene; FAI, femoroacetabular
  impingement; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; OA, osteoarthritis.
article_title: Whole-genome RNA sequencing identifies distinct transcriptomic profiles
  in impingement cartilage between patients with femoroacetabular impingement and
  hip osteoarthritis.
