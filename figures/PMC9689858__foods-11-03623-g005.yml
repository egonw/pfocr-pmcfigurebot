caption: Functional changes of microbial community during Daqu fermentation process.
  Secondary pathway annotation of functional genes, the black font represents the
  primary metabolic pathway, and the colored fonts represent the secondary metabolic
  pathway. The length of the histogram indicates the abundance level of functional
  genes (a), heatmap of abundance of major metabolic pathways (p < 0.05) (b). (Base
  on KEGG database).
