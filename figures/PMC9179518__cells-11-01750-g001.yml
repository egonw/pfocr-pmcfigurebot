caption: Role of ROS in regulating lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic function. Activation
  of VEGFR3 present in LECs by its ligand VEGF-C induces optimal Nox4-derived H2O2
  production, which in turn enhances VEGFR3 autophosphorylation and stimulates downstream
  pro-lymphangiogenic signaling (upper panel). Oxidized LDL and RSPO2 inhibit lymphangiogenesis
  via suppression of Akt/eNOS pathway. Under diabetic condition, excessive H2O2 generation
  elevates epsin expression and promotes VEGFR3 degradation, leading to attenuated
  lymphangiogenesis and reduced lymphatic transport. In inflammatory condition, supra-physiological
  NO production by CD11b+ myeloid immune cells surrounding LVs contributes to nitrosative
  stress leading to the suppression of lymphatic contractions and inducing LV leakiness
  (lower panel).
