caption: 'The RAS effects on the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. This figure
  illustrates the effects of the two main regulatory arms of the renin–angiotensin
  system (RAS) on the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. In the classic arm of
  the RAS, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin I (Ang I) into
  angiotensin II (Ang II), which activates angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1). This
  pathway triggers calcium release and reactive oxygen species production, finally
  resulting in increased oxidative stress, lipotoxicity, and tissue fibrosis. Opposing
  these effects, in the protective arm of the RAS, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
  (ACE2) generates angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)) from Ang II. Ang-(1-7) initiates
  a downstream molecule cascade through Mas receptor activation that increases glucose
  uptake by cardiomyocytes and upregulates antioxidant molecules. The binding of Ang-(1-7)
  to the Mas receptor suppresses oxidative stress, inhibits tissue fibrosis, and prevents
  extensive cardiac remodeling. Abbreviations: NADPH—nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate hydrogen; PiP2—phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; DAG—diacylglycerol;
  IP3—inositol trisphosphate; Pi3K—phosphoinositide 3-kinase; ERK1—extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase 1.'
