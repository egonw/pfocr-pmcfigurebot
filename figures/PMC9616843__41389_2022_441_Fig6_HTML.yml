figure_title: DUSP5P1 is a potential therapy target in platinum drugs resistant GC
  cells
caption: A DUSP5P1 transfected GC cells was partially resistant to the chemotherapy
  effect of Oxaliplatin by MTT assay. B DUSP5P1 Knockdown suppressed the GC PDO cell
  growth in the three of five platinum drugs resistant models. C Combination therapy
  of Oxaliplatin and DUSP5P1 depletion significantly inhibited the migration of the
  GC cells. D Representative HE staining image of the lung metastasis revealed metastasis
  synergistic inhibiting effect of Oxaliplatin and DUSP5P1 depletion in vivo. E Proposed
  mechanistic scheme of DUSP5P1 promoting the GC progression. DUSP5P1 promoted the
  expression of ARHGAP5, by directly binding to promoter region, which further promotes
  the activity of focal adhesion and MAPK signaling pathway. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.001.
