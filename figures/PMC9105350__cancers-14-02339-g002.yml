caption: Mechanisms associated with NKG2D ligand induction. Commonly activated pathways
  associated with cancer progression may influence stress ligand expression. The DNA
  damage response pathway, which is activated during cancer treatments, increases
  NKG2D ligand expression via activation of signaling kinases ataxia telangiectasia
  mutated (ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia and RAD3 related (ATR). ATM/ATR promote
  the activation of downstream targets that increase and maintain ligand expression.
  Genetic alterations, such as the oncogenic hits that promote tumorigenesis and behavioral
  phenotypes, including excessive proliferation and “epithelial-to-mesenchymal” transition,
  associated with tumor biology are also important regulators of NKG2D ligand expression.
