caption: 'IGF-1 weakens the inhibiting effects of RBG on the EMT and PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathway in MM cells. RPMI8226 cells were treated with 8 ÂµM RBG and 50 ng/ml IGF-1
  (an activator of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway). The protein expression of E-cadherin,
  N-cadherin, Vimentin, AKT, p-AKT, PI3K and p-PI3K was detected by Western blot.
  **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 vs. Control; #P<0.05, ##P<0.01 vs. RBG. RBG, resibufogenin;
  IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor 1; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition; MM,
  multiple myeloma; p, phosphorylated.'

  cells by blocking the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
