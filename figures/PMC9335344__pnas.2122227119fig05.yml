caption: PTBP1 expression correlates with plaque and expression of TNF pathway genes
  in human arteries. (A) Summary of arteries (Art.) of each type with indicated pathology
  data from the GTEx database (v7). (B and C) Examples of histological sections used
  for analysis of plaque characteristics in the GTEx database, showing examples of
  low (B) and high (C) plaque. (D–G) Analysis of expression of the indicated genes
  in arteries separated by low and high plaque phenotype. Each point in D–H represents
  a single artery sample. (H) Gene–gene correlation between the expression of PTBP1
  and IL1RL1 in human coronary arteries, where sex is indicated by different shading
  (gray = female; male = black). (I) Top GSEA Hallmark Gene Groups associated with
  genes most associated with Ptbp1 (highest Pearson scores). NES, normalized enrichment
  score. (J) Example GSEA plot, showing the location of TNF signaling via NF-κB Hallmark
  Genes among those most associated with PTBP1 expression (left side of the Pearson
  score plot). (D–G) Mann–Whitney U test.
