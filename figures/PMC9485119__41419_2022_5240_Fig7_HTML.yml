caption: 'A, B Xenograft tumors of nude mice of different groups with sEVs treatment
  (n = 6 per group). Tumor weight and body weight were measured at the endpoint. C
  HE and IHC of MOB1A in tumors of different groups (scale bar: 100 μm). D Schematic
  diagram of AOM/DSS -induced CRC in BALB/c mice. E The relative body weight changes
  of BALB/c mice are shown with time. F Representative images of colons (left) and
  colon lengths of the WT, AOM/DSS, A/D + CAF-sEVsNC, A/D + CAF-sEVsKD, A/D + CAF-sEVsCtrl,
  and A/D + CAF-sEVsOE mice (right), (n = 8 per group). G Representative images of
  colons (left) and the number of colonic tumors at least 2 mm or smaller than 2 mm
  per mouse (right). H Survival curves for the indicated mice (n = 10 per group).
  Statistical significance was determined by the Kaplan–Meier log-rank test. I HE
  and IHC of MOB1A in tumors of different groups (scale bar: 200 μm). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001, ns. not significant.'
