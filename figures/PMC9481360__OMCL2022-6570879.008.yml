caption: 'Cell cycle changes before and after IPO5 gene silencing detected by flow
  cytometry. (a, b) The proportion of G2/M phase increased before and after transfection
  of ECA109 cells. (c, d) The proportion of G2/M phase in OE33 cells increased before
  and after transfection. (e) The proportion of ECA109 and OE33 cells in the sh-IPO5
  group was significantly higher than that in the sh-NC group in the G2/M phase (note:
  ∗∗P < 0.01).'
