caption: Analysis of GLO and CAT enzyme activities in transgenic plants and intravital
  in situ DAB staining of H2O2 in leaves of transgenic plants. Different letters indicate
  statistically significant differences between genotypes as determined by ANOVA using
  Tukey-Kramer posthoc test (P < 0.05). Data sets without letters indicate no statistical
  differences. (A) GLO activity measured by POD method. Data are means ± SE of 30
  biological replicates. (B) GLO activity measured by phenylhydrazine hydrochloride
  method. Data are means ± SE of 30 biological replicates. (C) CAT activity. Data
  are means ± SE of 30 biological replicates. (D) Intravital in situ DAB staining
  of H2O2 in leaves of transgenic plants.
article_title: The appropriate expression and coordination of glycolate oxidase and
  catalase are vital to the successful construction of the photorespiratory metabolic
  pathway.
