caption: Expression of significant differentially expressed genes (SDEGs) related
  to ethylene biosynthesis and signaling pathway in Chrysanthemum morifolium infected
  with the Chinese isolate of chrysanthemum virus B (CVB-CN). a Expression profiles
  of the SDEGs related to ethylene biosynthesis and signaling pathway are illustrated
  using a heatmap. All the ethylene-related SDEGs were grouped into eight gene ontology
  (GO) terms. b Significance analysis of the eight ethylene-related GO terms under
  infection with the Chinese isolate of chrysanthemum virus B (CVB-CN). The red box
  shows significant GO terms. c The number of upregulated genes and downregulated
  SDEGs assigned to GO:0009873 or GO:0009723 terms. Red indicates upregulated genes
  and blue indicates downregulated genes. d A schematic representation of the SDEGs
  implicated in the ethylene pathway established based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of
  Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database and previous studies on the model plant species
  Arabidopsis. Pentagrams () indicate the SDEGs identified during CVB-CN infection.
  Heat maps represent Log2 ratios of (CVB-CN/Cont) from three biological replicates.
  Arrows indicate activation of the pathway, and T-bars indicate the repression. SAM,
  S-adenosylmethionine; SAS, SAM synthase; ACC, 1-aminocyclopropane-1 -carboxylic
  acid; ACS, ACC synthase; ACO, ACC oxidase; ETR1, ethylene response 1; CTR1, constitutive
  triple response 1; EIN2, ethylene insensitive 2; EIN3, ethylene insensitive 3; EBF1/2,
  EIN3 binding F-box 1/2; ERF1, ethylene response factor 1; ERFs, ethylene-responsive
  transcription factors
