caption: KEGG enrichment analysis in the positive ion mode across comparison groups.
  The larger the abscissa value, the greater the degree of enrichment of differential
  metabolites. The pointâ€™s color shows the p-value of the hypergeometric test. The
  lower the value is, the more reliable the test is and the more statistically significant
  it is. The size of the dots represents the number of different metabolites in the
  pathway. (A) N6 vs. C0; (B) NE vs. C0; (C) CE vs. C0; and (D) NE vs. CE.
