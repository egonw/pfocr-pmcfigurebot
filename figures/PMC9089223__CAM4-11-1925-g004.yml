caption: 'Downregulation of Bcl‐XL after Wnt inhibition in intestinal cancer cells.
  (A) The downregulation of Wnt and BAD signaling pathway in CWP232291‐treated allografts
  (n = 2) and vehicle‐treated allografts (n = 2) using GSEA based on mouse gene expression
  microarray analysis. Either 150 mg/kg of CWP232291 or vehicle was administered to
  SCID mice biweekly for 8 weeks after subcutaneous injection of 1 × 106 primary #1
  cells. (B) Western blot analysis for Bcl‐XL and Bcl‐2 in normal intestinal mucosa
  from each genotype and Villin‐Cre; Smad4F / F; Trp53F / F primary intestinal tumors.
  vSP, Villin‐Cre; Smad4F / F; Trp53F / F. vS, Villin‐Cre; Smad4F / F. vP, Villin‐Cre;
  Trp53F / F. AdenoC, adenocarcinoma. (C) Western blot analysis for Bcl‐XL expression
  in CWP232291‐treated allografts (n = 3) and vehicle‐treated allografts (n = 3).
  (D) Reduced Bcl‐XL expression in CWP232291‐treated primary #1 cells dose‐ and time‐dependently
  based on western blot analysis. (E) Reduced Bcl‐XL expression in primary #1 cells
  after treatment with Wnt small‐molecule inhibitors based on western blot analysis.
  CCT, 20 µM CCT031374. PKF, 2 µM PKF 118–310. BC21, 10 µM BC21. (F) Western blot
  analysis for Bcl‐XL and Bcl‐2 in monolayer and sphere cultures of primary #1, SW620,
  and COLO205 cells. (G) Sphere‐forming assay showing reduced tumorsphere formation
  after treatment of primary #1 cells with BH3I‐1, a Bcl‐XL antagonist at a dose‐dependent
  manner. Right, the growth inhibitory effect of BH3I‐1 on monolayer culture of primary
  #1 cells was measured by MTT assay. (H) Bcl‐XL overexpression in primary #1 cells
  as confirmed by western blot analysis. (I) Sphere‐forming assay in Bcl‐XL‐overexpressing
  primary #1 cells after CWP232291 treatment. Representative images for sphere‐forming
  assay were shown in the right. GSEA, gene set enrichment analysis; NS, No significance.
