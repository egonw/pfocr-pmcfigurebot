caption: 'Effects of RA on CP-induced levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in serum. The
  expression levels of the serum inflammatory factors IL-1β (a), IL-6 (b) and TNF-α
  (c) in mice were detected by ELISA. These experiments were repeated three times.
  * denote significant differences (p < 0.05) and ** and ## denote highly significant
  differences (p < 0.01) compared with the control and CP model groups, respectively.'
