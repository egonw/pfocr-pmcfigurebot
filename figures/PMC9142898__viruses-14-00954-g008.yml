caption: Model of ICP0 interfering with the NF-κB signaling pathway. The PRV protein
  ICP0 blocks the degradation of IκBα and inhibits its phosphorylation. Meanwhile,
  ICP0 interacts with p65 and degrades p65 protein expression via the proteasome pathway.
  In addition, ICP0 inhibits p65 phosphorylation and prevents its nuclear translocation,
  thereby negatively regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway.
