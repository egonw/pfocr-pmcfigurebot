caption: 'Effect of baicalin on the cell cycle of Aβ1-42-treated SH-SY5Y cells. (a)
  Control group. (b) Model group (10 μM Aβ1-42). (c) 5 μM baicalin treatment group.
  (d) 10 μM baicalin treatment group. (e) 20 μM baicalin treatment group. (f) The
  data are presented as the mean ± SD. N = 5; compared with the model group, ## represents
  P < 0.01; compared with the model group, ∗∗ represents P < 0.01.'
