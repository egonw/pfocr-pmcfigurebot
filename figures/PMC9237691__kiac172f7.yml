caption: OsiWAK1 was involved in the development of microspores and tapetum. A and
  B, Plant and panicle phenotypes at the seed maturation stage, respectively. C, Pollen
  grains at Stage 12 stained by I2-KI. D–W, Transverse sections of anthers. D–H, Anthers
  were obtained from the WT at Stages 8b, 9, 10, 12, and 14, respectively. I–M, Anthers
  were obtained from the WI at Stages 8b, 9, 10, 12, and 14, respectively. N–R, Anthers
  were obtained from the WEO at Stages 8b, 9, 10, 12, and 14, respectively. S–W, Anthers
  were obtained from the ospdt1/WEO at Stages 8b, 9, 10, 12, and 14, respectively.
  Tetrad pollen grains are indicated by arrows. dM, degraded microspore; mP, mature
  pollen; Msp, microspore; pdt1/WEO, OsiWAK1-eYFP overexpressing line in the ospdt1
  background; T, tapetum; Tds, tetrads; WEO, OsiWAK1-eYFP overexpressing line; WI,
  OsiWAK1 RNA-interference line. Bars, 10 cm in (A) and (B), 50 µm in (C), and 10 µm
  in (D)–(W).
