caption: KEGG enrichment analysis of DAMs in the cold-treated C. pubescens and C.
  chinense pepper seedlings. The ordinate indicates the pathway name, and the abscissa
  is the enrichment factor. The size of the circle indicates the number of genes enriched
  in the KEGG pathway, and the color of the circle represents the p-value.
