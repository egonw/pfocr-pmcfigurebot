figure_title: Pathways predicted to show daily changes
caption: Predicted daily changes in the KEGG pathways in the cecum under (A) LW and
  (B) SC conditions. Predicted daily change in the KEGG pathways in the large intestine
  under (C) LW and (B) SC conditions. PICRUSt prediction results that focused on daily
  changes of gut microbiome in cecum and large intestine of CBA/N mice. The left legend
  represents the KEGG pathways determined by ANCOM to be significantly different by
  sampling time (left; level 2, right; level 6). The bar graph on the right represents
  the median of percentile abundances each functional pathway.
