caption: Genetic aberrations and mRNA upregulation of YAP1 and TAZ in gastrointestinal
  cancers. The TCGA PanCancer dataset illustrated the proportion of YAP1/TAZ alterations
  (including gene amplification, deep deletion, inframe and missense mutations, structural
  variants, and mRNA changes) in primary digestive cancers. Only positive cases with
  alterations were demonstrated in this Figure. COAD, colon adenocarcinoma; ESCA,
  esophageal carcinoma; LIHC, liver hepatocellular carcinoma; PAAD, pancreatic adenocarcinoma;
  STAD stomach adenocarcinoma.
