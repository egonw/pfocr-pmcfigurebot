caption: An outlined diagram of miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNA involved in the drug
  resistance of esophageal cancer. Multiple miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNA have been
  found to be linked to the drug resistance of esophageal cancer through altering
  cell proliferation, apoptosis, DNA damage repair, cell cycle progression, autophagy,
  cancer stem cell, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition via modulating corresponding
  target genes and signaling pathway.
