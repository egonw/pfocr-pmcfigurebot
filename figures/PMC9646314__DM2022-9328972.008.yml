caption: The suppressive effects of FOXA1 silencing on EMT through TGF-beta 1 signaling
  pathway. (a) Predicted binding site of FOXA1 at the wild-type CTGF promoter region
  and the mutant CTGF promoter (-399 to -390) was present. (b) Relative luciferase
  activity was presented as per the ratio of the intensity of firefly luciferase to
  that of Renilla. (c) Western blot analysis on protein expression levels of FOXA1,
  CTGF, MMP-2, E-cadherin, and Snail in the siRNA-NC-, or the siRNA-FOXA1-transfected
  cells treated with or without TGF-β1. Quantifications of protein expressions was
  represented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) of the results from six independent
  replicates in each group. (d) Expressions of FOXA1, CTGF, cleaved TGF-beta 1, and
  EMT-associated markers including E-cadherin, vimentin, and Snail were analyzed by
  western blot after 48 h after the transfected cells treated with or without lithium
  chloride. Quantification of the representative blots was represented as mean ± standard
  deviation (SD) of the results from three independent experiment in bar graphs.
