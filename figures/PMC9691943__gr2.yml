caption: HOTAIR is required for the self-renewal maintenance of breast CSCs.A, HOTAIR
  was silenced in breast CSCs by two independent shRNAs and analyzed by RT-PCR. HOTAIR-silenced
  stable cell lines were established. Data are shown as means ± SD. B, ALDH1+ (CSC)
  subpopulations were detected in HOTAIR-depleted cells by FACS analysis. Results
  are shown as means ± SD. C, HOTAIR depletion causes a diminished oncosphere-forming
  capacity in MCF7 CSC. Cells were magnified by 100 folds and the scale bar represented
  10 μm. D, different numbers of HOTAIR-silenced or control breast CSC of MCF7 were
  diluted and subcutaneously implanted into NOD/SCID nude mice. Tumor-free mice were
  measured 1 month after injection. N = 10 for each group. E, different numbers of
  HOTAIR-silenced or control breast CSC of MDA-MB-453 were diluted and subcutaneously
  implanted into NOD/SCID nude mice. Tumor-free mice were measured 1 month after injection.
  N = 10 for each group. F, HOTAIR-silenced or control breast CSC of MCF7 were diluted
  and subcutaneously implanted into NOD/SCID nude mice. Tumors were observed over
  1 month. N = 10 for each group. G, HOTAIR-silenced or control breast CSC of MDA-MB-453
  were diluted and subcutaneously implanted into NOD/SCID nude mice. Tumors were observed
  over 1 month. N = 10 for each group. H, pluripotent transcription factors were analyzed
  in HOTAIR-depleted cells by quantitative real-time PCR. Results are shown as means ±
  SD in MDA-MB-453. I, the level of pluripotent transcription factors were analyzed
  in HOTAIR-depleted cell by Western blotting. β-actin was used as a control. CSC,
  cancer stem cell; HOTAIR, Hox transcript antisense intergenic RNA (∗ indicates p
  < 0.05; ∗∗ indicates p < 0.01; ∗∗∗ indicates p < 0.001.).
