caption: Effects of DHT on insulin signaling and expression of key regulators of feeding
  in the hypothalamus of 13-week-old rats. a, d Representative immunoblot showing
  protein levels in the hypothalamus tissues of DHT and control rats after 14 h of
  fasting with or without insulin injection, respectively. b, e Results of densitometry
  analysis on the ratio of p-AKT/AKT. Note the sharp reduction in the phosphorylation
  of AKT and GSK phosphorylation in DHT rats. c, f Results of densitometry analysis
  on the ratio of p-GSK/GSK. The administration of exogenous insulin could not fully
  alleviate the DHT-induced inhibition of AKT and GSK phosphorylation. g Blood glucose
  levels in the IPGTT after ICV injection of LY294002. Blocking the PI3K/AKT pathway
  led to decreased glucose tolerance. Experiments were performed in 3 rats for each
  group. Data are expressed as the mean Â± SEM (n = 3). *p < 0.05. SEM, standard error.
