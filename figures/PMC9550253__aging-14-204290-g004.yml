caption: Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFUS) inhibited the levels of pro-inflammatory
  factors in traumatic brain injury (TBI) rat models by orexin-A (OX-A). (A) tumor
  necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-18 (IL-18) represent
  western blot protein bands, (B–D) are the gray values of TNF-a, IL-1β, and IL-18
  bands, respectively, Results are expressed as mean±standard deviation (n=6, SD,
  *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001).
