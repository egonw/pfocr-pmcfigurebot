caption: Effects of GDF11 on migration and cell cycle-related proteins. (A) The mRNA
  levels of cell cycle-related proteins (Cyclin D1, D2, A and B1) when PC12 cells
  were treated with GDF11 or vehicle (control) for 5 h. (B) Quantitative analysis
  of migration as in (C). (C) Wound healing/migration was monitored over time by an
  Ibidi Culture-Insert. Black in each graph represented as the wound area. * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
