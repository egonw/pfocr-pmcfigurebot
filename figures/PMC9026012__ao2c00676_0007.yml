caption: Real-time analysis of selected miRNA levels quantified by real-time PCR at
  preflowering, flowering, and postflowering stages in root (a,b,c) and leaf (d,e,f)
  tissues of the B. juncea cultivar Varuna. The expression levels of miRNAs were normalized
  to the expression level of U6 snRNA. Relative expression was calculated using the
  2∧ equation, where Ct = (Ct – Ctu6). 1, miR395a; 2, miR865-5p; 3, miR843; 4, miR863;
  5, miR2111a-5p; 6, miR5661; 7, miR396a; 8, miR5650; 9, miR838; and 10, miR159a.
  ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test was applied to all miRNAs compared to U6. The error
  bar shows the standard error. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.
