caption: Fyn-RhoA-ROCK signaling (on laminin-511). In cultures using laminin-511 scaffolds,
  the E-cadherin-α6β1 integrin signaling pathway regulates hiPSC cell death. PI3K
  signaling promotes the expression of Rac1, which binds to cadherin, inhibiting cadherin
  endocytosis and increasing the expression of cadherin on the plasma membrane. When
  α6β1 integrin binds to laminin-511, Fyn-RhoA-ROCK signaling is induced. As a result,
  ROCK-induced hiPSC cell death is inhibited. This figure is a modified version of
  an illustration in our previous article []. hiPSC, human induced pluripotent stem
  cells; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.
