caption: 'Relative mRNA expression of VDR-related genes downstream of the vitamin-VDR
  pathway in controls, HCV+, and cirrhotic patients. The mRNA levels were quantified
  by qPCR, and the values are expressed relative to the reference β-actin gene. Results
  are expressed as median with error bars (95% CI). Kruskal–Wallis H and Mann–Whitney
  U tests were used to compare values between groups and were adjusted for multiple
  comparisons. p < 0.05: statistically significant difference.'
