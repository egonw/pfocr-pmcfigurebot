caption: CD2AP is a molecular target of bta-miR-199a-3p. (A) TargetScan and miRWalk
  predicted the binding site of bta-miR-199a-3p to CD2AP 3′-UTR, where “ACGAC” is
  the mutated base. (B) The results of double luciferase activity detection. The miR-199a-3p
  mimic or mimic NC and the wild-type or mutation-type CD2AP 3′-UTR luciferase reporter
  vector were co-transfected into 293T cells for double luciferase activity detection
  after 48 h. The relative luciferase activity on the ordinate represents the ratio
  of renilla luciferase activity to firefly luciferase activity. ** refers to p <
  0.01, ns refers to p > 0.05.
