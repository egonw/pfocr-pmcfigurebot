figure_title: Identification of potential GPSM1 inhibitors
caption: a SPR assay with Biacore diagram and saturation curve of AN-465/42243987
  binding to GPSM1 protein. As AN-465/42243987 concentration increases, the chip RU
  continues to increases. b–f BMDMs treated with 50 μM AN-465/42243987 or vehicle
  control for 16 h and then stimulated with LPS or not. b Representative immunofluorescence
  images indicating P65 nuclei translocation showed by high-content screen. BMDMs
  were stained for P65 (red) and DAPI (blue). Scale bars, 100 μm. c Quantification
  of the proportion of P65 nuclear translocation exhibited in (b) (n = 3 independent
  samples per condition). d The mRNA abundance of A20 in BMDMs after LPS stimulation
  for 20 min (n = 4 independent samples per condition). e The mRNA abundance of pro-inflammatory
  markers in BMDMs stimulated with LPS for 3 h (n = 3 independent samples per condition).
  f The effect of AN-465/42243987 on P65 translocation in GPSM1f/f and GPSM1f/f; Lyz2-cre
  BMDMs (n = 3 or 4 independent samples per condition). Positive% was defined as the
  index (P65 intensity in nuclei/cytoplasm) > 1.5. g–n In vivo effects of AN-465/42243987.
  DIO mice (already HFD-fed for 8 weeks) were peritoneally administered with either
  0.5 mg/kg AN-465/42243987 or vehicle, twice per week for 4 weeks. g Body weights
  (n = 10 biologically independent mice per group). h Tissue weights (n = 10 biologically
  independent mice per group). i GTT and AOC (n = 7 biologically independent mice
  per group). j ITT and AOC (n = 7 biologically independent mice per group). k Oil
  Red O staining. Scale bars, 100 μm. l H&E and F4/80+ IHC staining of eWAT. Scale
  bars, 100 μm. m Representative flow cytometry analysis and quantification of the
  expression of CD11c from CD45+F4/80+ cells in SVFs from eWAT (n = 4 biologically
  independent mice per group) and scWAT (n = 3 biologically independent mice per group).
  n RT-PCR analysis indicating mRNA abundance in eWAT (n = 9 biologically independent
  mice per group). Independent experiments were performed three times with similar
  results (b, k, l). All data are presented as means ± SEM. P values are determined
  by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test (d, e, h to j, m, and n), or the two-way
  ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple-comparisons test (g, i, and j) or one-way ANOVA with
  Tukey’s multiple-comparisons test (c).
