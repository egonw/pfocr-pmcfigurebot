caption: Enhanced plant defense responses and expression of defense-related genes
  by JR48. (A) H2O2 accumulation during pathogen infection. Leaves of pre-treated
  wild-type Arabidopsis Col-0 were infiltrated with Xcc 8004. DAB staining was performed
  at the indicated time points. Scale bar, 60 μm. (B) Callose deposition during pathogen
  infection. Pre-treated Arabidopsis leaves were inoculated with Xcc 8004. Leaves
  were detached for callose staining at the indicated time points. Representative
  images were photographed and numbers of callose deposition were calculated (mean
  ± SD; n (number of leaves) ≥ 8). Student’s t-test was used to determine significant
  differences between Control and JR48 (**P < 0.01). Experiments were repeated in
  triplicate. (C) Relative transcript levels of PTI marker genes and two RBOHs. Relative
  expression of the indicated genes in Arabidopsis at 12 h post Xcc infection was
  determined by qRT-PCR. EF1α was used as an internal reference. Each value represents
  the mean of three replicates and error bars indicate SD. Asterisks indicate significant
  differences (**P < 0.01, Student’s t-test). This experiment was repeated three times
  with similar results.
