caption: TLR4 inhibition increased BTZ-induced mitophagy activation. (A) Immunofluorescence
  for the colocalization of LC3 (green) and mitochondria (stained by using MitoTracker
  red) after drug treatments in myeloma cells. (B) Analysis of PINK1 expression after
  drug treatments for 24 h. GAPDH protein was used as total protein loading reference.
  For analysis, the optical density of the bands was measured using Scion Image software.
  Data are expressed as mean MFI ± SEM of n ≥ 4 biological replicates; * p < 0.05;
  ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001.
