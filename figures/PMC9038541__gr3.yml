  Process terms enriched for upregulated genes in HFD-fed vs. chow-fed mice. The two
  representative GSEA plots for Human Reactome Pathway “PPARa activates gene expression”
  and GO term “long-chain fatty acid metabolic process” are visualized. The complete
  GSEA report is available in .(C) The dot plot visualizes the top eight GO Biological
  Process terms enriched for downregulated genes in HFD-fed vs. chow-fed mice. The
  two representative GSEA plots for GO terms “ATP metabolic process” and “oxidative
  phosphorylation” are visualized. The complete GSEA report is available in .
