figure_title: The Piezo1 channel promotes the tumorigenesis of prostate through the
  Akt/mTOR pathway (adapted from 111)
caption: The overexpression of Piezo1 might cause an intracellular Ca2+ increase,
  which directly or indirectly accelerates the phosphorylation of the AKT and mTOR.
  Phosphorylation of upstream targets might upregulate the expression of Cyclin D1
  and CDK4 and promote the assembly of the Cyclin D1/CDK4 complex, contributing to
  the tumorigenesis of the prostate by promoting the cell cycle, as well as cell proliferation
  and growth.
