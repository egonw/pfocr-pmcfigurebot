caption: (a) Model development process from reconstruction from the annotated genome
  to refinements and analysis. (b) Distribution of metabolic reaction types in the
  model. (c) Comparison of iEB1159 model and two models of C. salexigens iOA584 and
  iFP764. (d) MEMOTE test for model benchmarking. (e) Carbon sources that were shown
  to produce growth in minimal media and their corresponding fluxes. (f) Escher map
  of Glucose metabolism showing the flow of metabolites and the distribution of flux
  in the central carbon metabolism pathway. The colors represent different flux ranges
  as shown in the legend.
