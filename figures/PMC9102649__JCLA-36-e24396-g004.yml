caption: Silencing CDCA5 expression increases the proportion of apoptotic NSCLC cells
  and arrests NSCLC cells in G1 phase. A and B, qRT‐PCR (A) and WB (B) indicate that
  A549 and HCC827 cell lines are successfully transfected by si‐CDCA5. C, The expression
  of p53 and p21 in A549 and HCC827 decreas correspondingly after knocking down the
  expression of CDCA5. D, The proportion of A549 and HCC827 apoptotic cells increase
  correspondingly after knocking down the expression of CDCA5 by si‐CDCA5. E, Compared
  with the negative controls, the proportion of G1 phase arrest of A549 and HCC827
  cells transfected with si‐CDCA5 is significantly increased

  and G1 phase arrest of non‐small cell lung cancer cells via p53‐p21 signaling pathway.
