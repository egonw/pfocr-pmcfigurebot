caption: 'Cit pretreatment significantly inhibits activation of ROS and enhances the
  Nrf2 signaling pathway in vitro. (A) ROS levels were detected using 2'',7''-dichlorofluorescein
  diacetate staining. Representative images are shown. Scale bar, 100 µm. (B) Relative
  mRNA levels of NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3, Nrf2 and heme oxygenase-1.
  Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM (n=4). *P<0.05, **P<0.01 vs. con; #P<0.05,
  ##P<0.01 vs. LPS. (C) Mouse lung vascular endothelial cells were stained with Nrf2
  (green), while nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). Scale bar, 100 µm. ROS,
  reactive oxygen species; Nrf2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; LPS,
  lipopolysaccharide; Con, control; Cit, citrulline; ROS, reactive oxygen species.'
article_title: Citrulline protects against LPS‑induced acute lung injury by inhibiting
  ROS/NLRP3‑dependent pyroptosis and apoptosis via the Nrf2 signaling pathway.
