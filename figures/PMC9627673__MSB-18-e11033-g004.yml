figure_title: Pathway activity scoring reveals link between metabolites levels and
  fluxes
caption: A–CPearson correlation between metabolites levels factorized into principal
  components and fluxes of a pathway. Fluxes and metabolites of (A) glycolysis, (B)
  pentose phosphate pathway, and (C) purine metabolism. Data taken from Hackett et al ().
  PC1 is used as pathway activity score.
