caption: 'Effects of DEAC, CM, and AMB on inflammatory cytokine release in LPS-stimulated
  BV-2 cells. Cells were pretreated with DEAC (100 μg/mL), CM (50 and 100 μg/mL),
  and AMB (25 μg/mL) for 1 h and activated with LPS (0.5 μg/mL) for additional 24 h.
  The results are expressed as mean ± SEM. For statistical analysis, one-way ANOVA
  was used followed by the Bonferroni posttest. #p < 0.05 vs. negative control (0.1%
  DMSO, drug vehicle); ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001 vs. LPS group, n = 4/group.'
