caption: Identification of the therapeutic targets. (A) Venn diagram showing the number
  of targets predicted. There are 254 targets for PF and Asthma. (B)The PPI network
  of 50 targets. Bright orange (or violet) represents key genes, the size of the octagonal
  circle is related to its â€“ Log(p) of genes. Having a more multilateral target indicates
  that there are more targets connected to it, thus suggesting the target has a more
  central role within the network.
