caption: Effect of YBS on gene expression and function in DRG tissues of LDH rats
  through RNA-Seq analysis. (a) PCA of gene expression in DRG tissue. Dots represent
  the sample. Different groups are indicated in different colors. (b) Volcano map
  of DEGs in DRG tissues. Red dots represent genes with increased expression, and
  green dots represent genes with reduced expression. (c) Heat map of DEGs in DRG
  tissues. Red indicates high expression, and blue represents low expression. (d)
  GO terms levels of differentially expressed genes. The ordinate is GO term, and
  the abscissa is the number of differential genes in the GO term. The longer the
  annotation bar represents, the greater the number of differential genes. (e) Top
  20 KEGG pathway enrichment of DEG. The ordinate is the pathway, and the abscissa
  is the enrichment factor (the number of differences in the pathway is divided by
  all the numbers). The size of the circle indicates the number. The redder the color,
  the smaller the P or Q value. The redder and the bigger the bubble, the more differential
  genes are enriched in the pathway.
