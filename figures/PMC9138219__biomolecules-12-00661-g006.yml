caption: 'Effects of HBOT on the protein expressions of mitochondrial biogenesis in
  the midbrain tissue of MPTP-treated mice. Protein expression of (A) SIRT-1, (B)
  PGC-1α, (C) TFAM and (D) VDAC were detected by Western blotting. All data are expressed
  as mean ± SEM (n = 3–4). # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01 and ### p < 0.001 compared with
  the control group; * p < 0.05 and *** p < 0.001 compared with the MPTP group.'
