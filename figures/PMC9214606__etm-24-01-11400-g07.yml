caption: 'Notch1 overexpression reverses the effect of GRWD1 knockdown on the Notch
  signaling pathway in triple negative breast cancer cells. The expression of p21,
  c-Myc, CCND1, HER2 and NF-ÎºB in MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 cells co-transfected with
  siRNA-GRWD1 and Ov-Notch1 was detected by western blotting. **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001
  vs. Control group. #P<0.05, ##P<0.01 and ###P<0.001 vs. siRNA-GRWD1 + Ov-NC group.
  GRWD1, glutamate-rich WD-repeat-containing protein 1; CCND1, cyclin D1; HER2, human
  epidermal growth factor 2 receptor; siRNA, small interfering RNA; NC, negative control;
  Ov, overexpression.'
