caption: Working model. In AML, HSPC-like leukemic cell populations exhibited one
  of two known chemoresistance-related expression signatures (LSC and OXPHOS) derived
  from mouse models (left panel). Among them, HSC-like leukemic cells characterized
  by the surface marker CD69 possessed chemoresistant capacity possibly via the CD69-mTOR
  axis. Suppression of the mTOR signaling pathway, in the CD69+ HSC-like cell subpopulation
  and CD69-overexpressing cell lines, might lead to cell quiescence via suppression
  of cell cycle regulators CCND1 and CDK6 (as shown in Figs. a and b, and Fig. S5a)
  and cell adhesion to stromal cells such as MSCs through the CXCR4-CXCL12 interaction
  (as shown in Fig.Â d, f). Patients with the CD69+ HSC-like subpopulation were associated
  with M0/M1 subtypes and specific genomic alterations and had worse clinical outcomes
