caption: Stage-specific effect of IP6 feeding on angiogenic pathway in dorsolateral
  prostate of TRAMP mice. Effect on (A) microvessel density (MVD) as inferred by expression
  of PECAM-1/CD-31. MVD was determined by calculating the number of positive foci
  counted under ×400 magnifications in five selected areas in each section. Effect
  on (B) VEGF, (C) iNOS, (D) CXCR3 expression in TRAMP mice prostate and IP6-fed mice
  as determined by IHC. Quantified data are represented as mean ± SEM. *** p ≤ 0.001,
  ** p ≤ 0.01, and * p ≤ 0.05.
