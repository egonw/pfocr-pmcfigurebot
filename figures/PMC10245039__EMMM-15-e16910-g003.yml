figure_title: MycER activation causes ROS production and induces an oxidative stress
  response
caption: 'FLMycER cells, primed or not with OHT (48 h), were treated with 135 nm IACS‐010759
  (IACS) for 24 (A) or 48 h (B–D). Top 10 OHT‐activated pathways (highest z‐score),
  as determined by IPA canonical pathway analysis on DEGs from cells treated or not
  with OHT (72 h), either alone (left) or in the presence of IACS‐010759 (for the
  last 24 h; right). Note that the RNA‐seq data and DEG lists used here are the same
  as in our previous study (Donati et al, ), while the IPA analysis presented here
  is new.H2O2 quantification, expressed as fold‐increase of the 405/488 nm fluorescence
  ratio in treated vs. untreated FLMycER cells, expressing either the cytoplasmic
  (left) or mitochondrial (right) roGFP2‐ORP1 biosensor.Superoxide anion O2·− production
  in treated vs. untreated FLMycER cells, based on dihydroethidium staining. Data
  information: *P ≤ 0.05 (one‐way ANOVA). Each point in the graphs in (B and C) is
  from an independent biological replicate, each representing the average of thousands
  of events (single cells) in a distinct cell population, normalized to the untreated
  condition. Single‐cell measurement distributions from representative experiments
  are provided in Appendix Fig A and B, respectively. Source data are available online
  for this figure.'
