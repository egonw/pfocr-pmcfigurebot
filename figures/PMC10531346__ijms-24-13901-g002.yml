caption: Superimposed tertiary structures of PvDFRa (pink), SbFNR1 (blue), and SbANR
  (green). Catalytic triad residues, as well as bound NADP+ are represented as sticks.
  The catalytic triads are shown with residue numbers and arrows. Additionally, Asn-148/Tyr-138/Ser-131
  are important for substrate specificity. RMSD among those structures is shown in
  . Molecular graphics images were produced using the ChimeraX package (UCSF).
