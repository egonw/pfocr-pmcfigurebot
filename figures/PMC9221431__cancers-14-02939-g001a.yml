caption: 'Molecular profiling of ALK+ and ALK- ALCL-derived exosomes: (A) Nanoparticle
  tracking analysis (NTA) for the ALK+ (Karpas 299, Sup-M2) and ALK- (Mac1, Mac2A)
  ALCL exosomes. The mean size and particle concentration of the preparations are
  shown; (B) Immuno-electron microscopy (iEM) staining with gold particles for CD30
  on the ALCL-derived exosomes; (C) Western blot analysis of the ALK+ (upper panel)
  and ALK- (lower panel) ALCL whole cell and exosomal lysates shows the protein levels
  of Rab5 (exosomal marker), CD30, and AIF (quality control for the exosomal preparations);
  (D) Protein composition of the ALK+ and ALK- cell lines and exosomes. Alix is an
  exosomal marker; (E) Alongside the ALK+ ALCL cells and their respective exosomes
  are the NPM-ALK oncoprotein. The AP-1 transcription factor, known to be unregulated
  in ALK+ ALCL by NPM-ALK, is detected at a higher level in exosomes derived from
  ALK+ than ALK- ALCL cells. 11 Alix, Tsg101 and Rab5 are characteristic exosomal
  proteins; (F) Two crucial components of the sonic hedgehog pathway, SMO and Gli-1,
  which are known to be upregulated by NPM-ALK, are detected at a higher level in
  exosomes secreted by ALK+ than ALK- ALCL cell lines. Original images of western
  blot can be found at File S1 and donsitometry data for Western blots are shown in
  .'
