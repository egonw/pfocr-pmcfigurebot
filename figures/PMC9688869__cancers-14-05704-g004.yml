caption: High ACY1 expression predicts poor efficacy of radiotherapy and worse prognosis
  in patients with cervical or rectal cancer. (A) Kaplan–Meier analysis of OS, DSS
  and PFI in cervical cancer patients with radiotherapy based on ACY1 expression from
  TCGA datasets. (B) The relationship between the expression of ACY1 and the response
  to chemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer patients from the GSE46862 dataset. (C) Kaplan–Meier
  analysis of DSS in rectal cancer patients based on ACY1 expression from the GSE87211
  dataset. OS, overall survival; DSS, disease-specific survival; PFI, progression-free
  interval. * p < 0.05.
