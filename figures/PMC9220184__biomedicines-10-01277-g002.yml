caption: 'Inhibition of DNA-PK and ATR impairs downstream DDR signaling of different
  bladder cancer cell line models. (A,B) In vitro models used for drug response studies.
  NGS-based exome sequencing revealed a monoallelic PRKDC mutation of unknown functional
  significance in squamous-like SCaBER and two alterations in urothelial J82 cells.
  The urothelial basal-type VMCUB-1 cell line showed no PRKDC alteration. The ATR
  wild-type and biallelic TP53 mutations were present in all cell lines. (B) The type
  and position of the monoallelic PRKDC (DNA-PKcs) alterations of SCaBER and J82 cells
  are illustrated in a lollipop plot. The mutations found in SCaBER and J82 are of
  unknown significance. In J82 cells, the mutation of DNA-PKcs was located in the
  PI3_PI4 kinase domain (p.G3904S) close to the predicted binding site of AZD7648,
  potentially involving interaction with the amino acids at the positions Leu3751,
  Arg3737, Trp3805, Leu3806, Asn3926, and Ile3938 []. The identified mutation of DNA-PKcs
  in SCaBER cells was located at the N-terminal to the FAT domain, which is known
  to comprise a predominantly helical solenoid HEAT-repeat domain of variable length
  that mediates protein-protein interaction []. (C–E) Phospho-western blots were performed
  to assess activation of DNA-PK and ATR mediated pathways upon irradiation (radiation
  dose = 8 Gy), as well as single and dual DNA-PK/ATR inhibition, in SCaBER, VMCUB-1
  and J82 bladder cancer cells. Radiation of cells triggered activation of both DDR
  pathways (DNA-PK and ATR). In turn, phosphorylation of DNA-PK (Ser2056) and CHK1
  (Ser317) was effectively blocked upon single/dual treatment of increased concentrations
  of AZD7648 and Ceralasertib. Please note: For the ATR pathway, the activation of
  downstream target CHK1 (Ser317) was analyzed since the phosphorylation of ATR at
  position Thr1989 was not significantly altered upon AZD6738 (Ceralasertib) treatment
  (see ). ‘+’ and ‘−’ refers to the exposure or lack thereof to IR or drug.'
