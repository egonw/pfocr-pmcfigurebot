caption: (A) Representative extracted heatmap of differential aqueous-soluble metabolites
  in the liver. The color scale illustrates the relative abundances across the samples.
  Blue indicates metabolites that were significantly downregulated, while red indicates
  significantly upregulated metabolites. (B, C) PLS-DA score plots of PC1 vs. PC2
  based on the LCâ€’MS/MS data of aqueous-soluble metabolites in liver (B) and muscle
  (C). (D) Pathway analysis of metabolites in the liver. The node color is based on
  its p value, and the node radius is determined based on their pathway impact values,
  (a) ascorbate and aldarate metabolism; (b) citrate cycle; (c) lysine degradation;
  (d) and tryptophan metabolism. (E) Pathway analysis of metabolites in muscle. (e)
  Alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism.
