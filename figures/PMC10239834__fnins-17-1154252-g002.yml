caption: Model-1 architecture. All the neurons in NF receive the same input of size
  5 × 5 but maintain random initial afferent weights. Response of one NF is passed
  to one cell-plane neuron. Thus, each cell-plane neuron maintains 400 (20 × 20) afferent
  connections with its input which were adopted during training. The response on eight
  cells-planes is converted into 1D vector and then concatenated to pass to OFNW/perceptron.
  OFNW is trained to classify four types of flow sequences.
