caption: Li et al. utilized CO2 as a low-cost C1 resource to obtain benzimidazole
  based on a base-promoted reductive functionalization with 1,2-phenylenediamines.
  The synthesis used inexpensive acetate salt CH3COOK as a catalyst and delivered
  products in moderate to excellent yields under mild conditions (40 Â°C, 1 bar CO2)
  (). A reaction pathway was also suggested.
