caption: 'Schematic representation of the principal biochemical pathways that mediate
  mechanotransduction: (a) β-Catenin at the membrane level binds E-Cadherin and contributes
  to cellular adhesion; (b) Activation of the Wnt/ β-Catenin pathway: Wnt ligands
  and mechanical stimuli mediated by integrins inhibit the β-Catenin destruction complex
  and induce β-Catenin translocation to the nucleus where its leads to transcription
  of target genes involved in diverse cellular functions; (c) Activation of YAP/TAZ
  nuclear translocation and transcriptional co-activator function is induced by ECM
  mechanical properties and external mechanical stimuli, which are sensed by the cell
  through the integrins and GPCRs signaling routes; with the mediation of the RHO
  GTPase pathway, F-Actin formation and contractility through Myosin II induce YAP/TAZ
  nuclear translocation and inactivation of the Hippo kinase core, allowing transcription
  of target genes; (d) Mechanical stimuli such as cellular detachment, soft ECM, together
  with excessive formation of adherens junction due to cell crowding and inhibition
  of FAK or F-Actin formation, cause YAP/TAZ inhibition due to phosphorylation of
  the core Hippo kinases and of YAP/TAZ, leading to their cytoplasmatic degradation.
