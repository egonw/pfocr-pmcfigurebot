caption: 'Effect of NDV-induced autophagy on activation of ERK1/2, JNK, and p38/MAPK
  pathways, the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, and NDV-NP protein expression. Treatment
  of NDV-infected DF-1 cells with A CQ, 3-MA, and BÂ ATG16L1-specific siRNAs led to
  a decrease in phospho-p38 levels, while no significant changes were seen in the
  phospho-ERK and phospho-JNK levels, compared cells treated with GM alone. Treatment
  with (C) rapamycin and D starvation resulted in a significant increase in the levels
  of phospho-p38, with no significant changes in the levels of phospho-ERK and phospho-JNK.
  The bottom blots in each panel show the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and the expression
  of NDV-NP protein in NDV-infected DF-1 cells treated with autophagy inhibitors or
  promoters. GAPDH is used as a protein loading control. NDV: Newcastle disease virus,
  CQ: chloroquine, 3-MA: 3-Methyladenine, ATG16L1: autophagy-related protein 16 like
  protein 1.'
