caption: Dietary CLA up-regulated A-FABP and PPARα expression in the quadriceps femoris
  of mice. (A–C) The total RNA from the quadriceps femoris of mice was extracted and
  RT-qPCR was performed to detect the mRNA levels of A-FABP and PPARα (A), and GAPDH
  was used as internal reference gene. RT-qPCR was analyzed using the cycle threshold
  (2–△△CT) method. Western blotting was performed to measure the protein level of
  A-FABP and PPARα (B), and the relative level of A-FABP and PPARα was analyzed by
  Image J (C). (D) SiRNA control (siRNA-Con) or siRNA-mediated knockdown of PPARα
  expression (siRNA-1) was transfected into 3T3-L1 cells for 4 h, and was then stimulated
  with CLA (100 μM) for 48 h. The A-FABP mRNA levels were measured by RT-qPCR. Data
  in panels (A,C,D) were analyzed by t-test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
