caption: 'Downregulation of METTL3 expression attenuates the inflammatory response
  and improves FK clinical scores. (A) Slit-lamp biomicrographs of mouse eyes 5 days
  after infection after pretreatment with AAV-sh-METTL3. (B) Histopathological observation
  of mouse corneal H&E staining. Scale bar: 50 µm. (C) Clinical scores showed that
  the inflammatory response was significantly reduced in the AAV-sh-METTL3 group compared
  with the FS group. (D–F) The mRNA levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α were significantly
  lower in the AAV-sh-METTL3 group than in the FS group. (G) Number of corneal fungal
  colonies in each group of mice. (H–K) Protein levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α were
  significantly lower in the AAV-sh-METTL3 group than in the FS group. *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001; n = 6.'
