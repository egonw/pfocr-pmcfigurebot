caption: 'Representation of the zebrafish adult brain shows the lateral and dorsal
  view with abbreviations for the following domains: olfactory bulb [OB], telencephalon
  [Tel], epiphysis cerebri or pineal [E], optic tectum [TeO], cerebellum [Ce], medulla
  oblongata [MO], hypothalamus [H] and hypophysis or pituitary [Pit]. Transcriptome
  sequencing was performed on cDNA from wild‐type and opn4 dko eyes and brains, sampled
  in the light phase (ZT4‐6). The brains were separated in an anterior part, which
  includes part of the forebrain and the pineal, and a posterior part, which includes
  part of the forebrain and the whole mid‐ and hindbrain. The cut lines through the
  depicted brain indicate where the brain was partitioned and which parts were subjected
  to transcriptome sequencing. The blue (anterior brain) and grey (posterior brain)
  arrows connect the brain parts in (A) with the differentially expressed genes in
  (B).Venn diagram shows the number of differentially expressed genes in the opn4
  dko anterior brain (dark blue circle), posterior brain (grey circle) and eye (light
  blue circle). The cutoff for differential expression was set at the significance
  level of α = 0.05. Heat maps of all the differentially expressed genes are presented
  in Appendix Fig . The number of differentially expressed genes that are shared between
  the data sets is indicated where the datasets overlap.Fisher''s exact test shows
  that the shared differentially expressed genes between data sets are unlikely to
  be the result of coincidence. P‐values for the common differentially expressed genes
  are indicated where the datasets overlap. The large number of common differentially
  expressed genes between the data sets derived from the anterior and posterior brain
  parts is likely due to forebrain regions that are shared between these parts.Pie
  chart shows the number of differentially expressed genes in the opn4 dko anterior
  brain that were assigned with KEGG software to phototransduction (dark blue), metabolic
  (orange) and other pathways. Of the metabolic pathway, 5 genes were assigned to
  the subcategory tryptophan metabolism (red), which encode all the enzymes that convert
  tryptophan into melatonin. Note that 189 genes were not assigned to a pathway.Ancestor
  charts show the gene ontology attributes to which the differentially expressed genes
  in the opn4 dko anterior brain were assigned with FuncAssociate software (cutoff:
  α = 0.05). The number of genes assigned to an attribute is indicated in the upper
  right corner. All retrieved biological processes and molecular functions are associated
  with light, consistent with knockout of a photoreceptor.  Source data are available
  online for this figure.'
