caption: Effects of Lys deficiency on differentiation, Wnt/Ca2+pathway, and muscle
  fiber ratio in semimembranosus and semitendinosus muscles. Expression assays of
  MyHC and key proteins (myogenin and MRF4) of the myogenic factor family in fast
  (semimembranosus; a,b) and slow (semitendinosus; c,d) muscles on d 15. Expression
  assays of key proteins (PKC, CaN, CaMKII, and NFATc1) of the Wnt/Ca2+pathway in
  fast (semimembranosus; e,f) and slow (semitendinosus; g,h) muscles on d 15. Three
  independent trials, each with n = 3, * indicates p < 0.05, ** indicates p < 0.01,
  *** indicates p < 0.001.
