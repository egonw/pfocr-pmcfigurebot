caption: RARγ induces chondrocytes degradation by activating NF-κB signaling pathway.
  (a–c) Effects of RARγ overexpression (a,b) and knockdown (c) on related signaling
  pathways in C28/I2 cells. (d,e) RARγ was overexpressed in C28/I2 and treated with
  BMS-345541 (10 μm) for 4 hours. The activation of NF-κB signaling pathway and the
  expression of related genes were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot. (f,g) RARγ
  was knockdown in C28/I2 and treated with TNF-α (30 ng/mL) for 4 hours. Activation
  of NF-κB signaling pathway and expression of related genes were detected by qRT-PCR
  and western blot. Data were means ± SEM of three independent assays (∗p < 0.05;
  ∗∗p < 0.01; and ∗∗∗p < 0.001).
