caption: Metabolism of tryptophan and the action of IDO (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase)
  inhibitors in the tryptophan metabolic pathway. In vivo, ~95% of L-tryptophan is
  catabolized via IDO in the form of kynurenine degradation products. Additional enzymatic
  metabolites in the pathway promote immune suppression. IDO inhibitors primarily
  compete with tryptophan by binding to the catalytic domain of IDO or non-competitive
  mechanisms to affect tryptophan metabolism, thereby exerting an inhibitory effect
  on IDO. IDO1, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1; IDO2, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 2;
  TDO, tryptophan dioxygenase; FAMID, formamidase; KATs, kynurenine aminotransferases;
  KMO, kynurenine 3-monooxygenase; KYNU, kynureninase; 3HAAO, 3-hydroxyanthranilic
  acid dioxygenase; QPRT, quinolinic-acid phosphoribosyl transferase; NAD+, nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide; GCN2, general control nondepressible-2; mTORC1, mammalian
  target of rapamycin complex 1; AhR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor; Treg cells, regulatory
  T cells.
