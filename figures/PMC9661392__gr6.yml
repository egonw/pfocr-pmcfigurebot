caption: 'TMEM100 inhibits PCa proliferation and apoptosis by regulating SCNN1D. (A)
  The analysis of STRING showed that TMEM100 interacted with SCNN1D. (B) Data derived
  from the GEPIA database showed that there was a significantly positive correlation
  between TMEM100 and SNCC1D. (C) The correlation between TMEM100 and TUBD1 was also
  detected. There was no significantly correlation between TMEM100 and TUBD1 in PCa
  tissues. (D) The western blot analysis showed that enhanced TMEM100 expression increased
  SCNN1D expression. (E)The expression level of SCNN1D was detected by western blot.
  (F-H) The depletion of SCNN1D increases proliferation in TMEM100-overexpression
  DU145 and PC3 cells. (I) The depletion of SCNN1D inhibits apoptosis in TMEM100-
  overexpression DU145 and PC3 cells. Scale bars = 20 μm. *P<0.05 VS control group,
  #P<0.05 VS TMEM100 overexpression group.'
