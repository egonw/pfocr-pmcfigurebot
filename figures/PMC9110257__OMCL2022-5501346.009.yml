caption: Schematic map concerning the functional role of LARS2 in POI. In the present
  study, we demonstrated that the downregulation of LARS2 induced granulosa cell apoptosis.
  Mechanically, our results showed that two different pathway were involved in LARS2-meidiated
  granulosa cell apoptosis. (I) Aberrant decrease of LARS expression impaired granulosa
  cell mitochondria function via inhibiting E2F1 mediated the mitochondrial motor
  protein MFN2 expression. Subsequently, the decreased MFN2 expression induced mitochondria
  dysfunction. The persistent mitochondria dysfunction promoted the release of cytochrome
  C. The accumulation of cytoplasmic cytochrome C activated mitochondrion-mediated
  cell apoptosis. (II) The dysregulation of LARS2 expression induced the increase
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in granulosa cell. The upregulation of ROS
  level caused mitochondria dysfunction, which leads to the accumulation of cytoplasmic
  cytochrome C. On the other hand, the increased ROS level induced the occurrence
  of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which provoked ER stress unfolded protein
  response (UPR). The activation of UPR upregulated apoptotic protein CHOP expression
  and promoted cell apoptosis.
