  normal morphology, thermotolerance, and CO2 tolerance
caption: (A) Cryptococcus neoformans WT H99 and RAM pathway mutants were serially
  diluted, spotted onto yeast peptone dextrose (YPD) medium, and incubated for 2 days
  at the indicated condition. (B) The cellular morphology of C. neoformans WT H99
  and RAM pathway mutants cultured in YPD medium.
