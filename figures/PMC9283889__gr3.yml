caption: Estimation of cell–cell communication within PDAC using CellChat(A) Heatmap
  showing the summary of the signaling pathways that contribute to outgoing or incoming
  communication. The color bar represents the relative signaling strength of a signaling
  pathway across cell types. The bars indicate the sum of the signaling strength of
  each cell type or pathway.(B) Circle plots displaying putative ligand–receptor interactions,
  with the width of edges representing the strength of the communication.(C) Chord
  diagram showing each ligand–receptor pattern and their weights in the interaction
  between CAFs and malignant cells.
