caption: 'Mitochondria: The key player in cellular function and its implication in
  diverse diseases. Besides producing ATP for numerous cellular pathways, mitochondria
  also regulate ROS and calcium levels, synthesize several biomolecules, and control
  cell death via the apoptosis pathway (A). Different stresses affect these mitochondrial
  functions leading to mitochondrial dysfunction (B). Mitochondria possess several
  pathways to avoid such damage by controlling the synthesis of new mitochondria,
  morphology, and eliminating any dysfunctional mitochondria (C). The altered function
  of these mitostasis mechanisms is observed in several disease conditions, including
  neuronal degenerative disorders such as ALS, AD, PD, and HD (D).'
