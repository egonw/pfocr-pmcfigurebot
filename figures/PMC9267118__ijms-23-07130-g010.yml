caption: Cytochalasin D and jasplakinolide only partially inhibited TNF-α-induced
  cell-surface ICAM-1 expression. (A–D) A549 cells were pretreated with serial dilutions
  of cytochalasin D (A,C) or jasplakinolide (B,D) for 1 h and were then treated with
  (blue circles in A,B and red circles in C,D) or without (gray circles) TNF-α (2.5
  ng/mL) in the presence of cytochalasin D or jasplakinolide at the indicated final
  concentrations for 6 h. Cell viability (%) (A,B) and cell-surface ICAM-1 (%) (C,D)
  are shown as the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. * p < 0.05, ** p
  < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001.
