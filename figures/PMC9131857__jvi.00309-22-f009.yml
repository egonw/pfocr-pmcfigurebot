caption: A proposed novel mechanism by which PPRV infection induces inflammatory responses.
  During PPRV infection, N protein directly interacts with MyD88 to activate the NF-κB
  signaling pathway; on the other hand, N protein interacts with NLRP3 to promote
  the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to the cleavage of
  pro-caspase-1 and the secretion of IL-1β.
