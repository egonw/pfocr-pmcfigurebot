caption: 'LMNA reversal of EMT by regulation of the FGFR/MAPK/c-fos signaling pathway.
  (A) Western blot analysis was performed to detect the expression of laminA/C, P-FGFR,
  P-AKT, P-ERK1/2, and P-c-fos in HCC827 and HCC827/ER cells. (B) HCC827/ER cells
  were transfected with LMNA expression vectors and treated with or without 2.5 μM
  erlotinib for 24 h, then subjected to Western blot analysis using the indicated
  primary antibody. Data are presented mean ± SD from three independent experiments.
  Significant differences are indicated as follows: Student’s t-test, ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001.'
