caption: hnRNP K activates interferon (IFN) signaling pathway via MyD88 upregulation.
  (A) HEK 293T cells were transfected with an IFN-β luciferase reporter and increasing
  doses of an expression vector encoding Flag-hnRNP K to examine dual luciferase activity.
  (B) HEK 293T cells were transfected with increasing doses of an expression vector
  encoding Flag-hnRNP K. qRT-PCR was used to determine IFN mRNA levels. (C) We attempted
  to co-transfect HEK 293T cells with plasmids encoding hnRNP K and IFN-β luciferase
  reporter together with plasmids encoding MDA5, RIG-I, MAVS, MyD88, TRAF3, TRAF6,
  TBK1, IKK, or IRF3. We investigated dual luciferase activity. (D) HEK 293T cell
  lysates were transfected with the expression vector encoding Flag-hnRNP K. MyD88
  siRNA, TRAF3 siRNA, and TRAF6 siRNA expression was examined using a luciferase assay.
  (E) HEK 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding Flag-hnRNP K, and levels
  of MyD88, TRAF3, and TRAF6 mRNA were quantified using qRT-PCR. (F) HEK 293T cells
  were transfected with the expression vector encoding Flag-hnRNP K for 24 h. Western
  blotting was used to assess cell lysates. (G) Flag-hnRNP K and MyD88 siRNA were
  co-transfected into HEK 293T cells for 24 h. Cell lysates were analyzed with a Western
  blot.
