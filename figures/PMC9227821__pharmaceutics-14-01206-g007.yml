caption: A proposed mechanism depicting the pathway by which diabetic ASC-Exo enhances
  diabetic wound healing. By adding ASC-Exo, resident monocytes/macrophages were stimulated
  to secrete more TGF-β1 and activate the TGF-β/Smad3 signaling pathway. Of note,
  ASC-Exo could increase the production of TGF-β1 of fibroblasts. Collectively, these
  findings indicate that TGF-β1 is centrally involved in ASC-Exo mediated cellular
  crosstalk as an important early response to initiate wound regeneration.
