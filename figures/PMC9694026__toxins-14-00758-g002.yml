caption: 'Effect of zearalenone (ZEA) on the growth state of porcine endometrial stromal
  cells. (A). Effect of ZEA on the growth status of cells (scale bar: 100 μm). Green
  fluorescence represents live cells and red fluorescence represents dead cells. (B).
  Effect of ZEA on cell ultrastructure (scale bar: 2 μm; 200 nm) The second set of
  images show magnified regions of the first set of images (red boxes). The red arrow
  represents the swelling and fracture of ER, the blue arrow represents nuclear chromatin
  margination. ESCs were treated with different concentrations of ZEA. Treatment time:
  24 h.'
