caption: 'Pathogenesis of endotheliopathy based on “two-activation theory of the endothelium”.
  Endothelial molecular pathogenesis is initiated by the activated complement system
  following exposure to a pathogen, toxin, drug, poison, venom, vaccine, polytrauma,
  hyperglycemia, severe hypertension, and others. Endotheliopathy releases inflammatory
  cytokines and hemostatic factors, and activates two clinically important pathways:
  inflammatory and microthrombotic. Both arterial endotheliopathy and venous endotheliopathy
  provoke inflammation via the inflammatory pathway, leading to inflammatory syndrome,
  such as MOIS due to cytokines, but arterial endotheliopathy promotes microthrombosis
  via the microthrombotic pathway and produces aEA-VMTD due to the activation of the
  ULVWF path of hemostasis. Arterial endotheliopathy is characterized by the triad
  of thrombocytopenia, MAHA, and MODS, which is called “TTP-like syndrome”, but venous
  endotheliopathy is characterized by ITP/“ITP-like syndrome” due to silent microthrombi
  with consumptive thrombocytopenia, as explained in the text. The distinguishing
  features are caused by the different anatomies, physiological functions, and hemodynamic
  characteristics between arterial system and venous system. These are very important
  pathophysiological features in the understanding of the complexity in variable phenotypes
  amongst the endotheliopathic syndromes. Abbreviations: EA-VMTD: endotheliopathy-associated
  vascular microthrombotic disease; ITP: immune thrombocytopenic purpura; MAC: membrane
  attack complex; IF: interferon; IL: interleukin; MAHA: microangiopathic hemolytic
  anemia; MODS: multiorgan dysfunction syndrome; MOIS: multiorgan inflammatory syndrome;
  TNF: tumor necrosis factor; TTP: thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; aEA-VMTD:
  arterial EA-VMTD; vEA-VMTD: venous EA-VMTD; ULVWF: ultra-large von Willebrand factor.'
