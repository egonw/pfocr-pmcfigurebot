figure_title: Phospho-proteome analysis of I-ASD and 16pDel data
caption: (A and B) Venn diagram illustrates proteomic (A) and p-proteomic (B) changes
  in both I-ASD and 16pDel NPCs and their overlap. (C and D) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  (IPA) canonical pathway analysis of I-ASD (C) and 16pDel (D) p-proteome data identifies
  the mTOR pathway as likely disrupted. (E) Heatmap of top overlapping canonical pathways
  between I-ASD and 16pDel p-proteome showing that the strongest overlap between I-ASD
  and 16pDel p-proteomes is the mTOR pathway. All p-proteome and proteome analyses
  were done with pooled proteins from all 3 I-ASD, all 3 Sib, and the 2 male 16pDel.
  Protein was extracted from at least 2 clones and 2 neural inductions per individual.

  the protein members in each enriched canonical pathway in I-ASD. (B) Table showing
  the protein members in each enriched canonical pathway in 16pDel ASD.
