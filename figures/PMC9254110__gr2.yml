caption: FOXF2 positively regulates ALDH+and/or CD44high/CD24lowpopulations and tumor-initiating
  capacity in luminal breast cancer cells but negatively regulates those in BLBC cells.A
  and B, cell populations of ALDH+ (A) and CD44high/CD24low (B) were assessed by FCM
  analysis. ∗, p < 0.05 compared with control cells. C, the tumor-initiating capability
  of the indicated cells was assessed by an in vivo limiting dilution tumor formation
  assay. Table showing the incidences of xenograft tumors formed by inoculating gradient
  concentrations of the indicated cells in NOD/SCID mice or nude mice. BLBC, basal-like
  breast cancers; FCM, flow cytometric.

  cancer cells through the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.
