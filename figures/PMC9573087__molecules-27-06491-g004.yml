caption: Representative model of antitumoral effects of Pllans–II on Ca Ski cells.
  The left part represents normal processes in untreated Ca Ski cells, where the ECM
  anchoring processes, the unfolded protein response (UPR), and the ER–associated
  protein degradation system (ERAD), develop in the endoplasmic reticulum, keeping
  the cells viable. The right part represents the possible effect of Pllans–II on
  cervical tumor cells. Pllans–II interferes initially with the binding of integrins
  to the ECM, which would affect cell adhesion and migration. In addition, this interaction
  could interfere with signaling pathways in the cell and modify the expression profile
  of genes related to UPR, mitochondrial permeabilization, and the ERAD pathway, which
  is usually responsible for the clearance of misfolded/unfolded proteins in ER. These
  effects would generate an increase in the stress on the endoplasmic reticulum in
  treated Ca Ski cells and not resolve it, leading to arrest in the cell cycle and
  apoptosis. Red arrows mean up–regulation, and green arrows mean down–regulation.
