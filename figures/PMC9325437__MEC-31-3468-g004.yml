caption: Schematic diagram of the cellular response of Delisea pulchra following exposure
  to the pathogen Aquimarina sp. AD1. Proteins and functions encoded by differentially
  expressed genes are represented in light blue, with upregulated genes shown in dark
  blue. Here we propose that cell‐wall‐degrading enzymes produced by AD1 degrade the
  cell wall of D. pulchra (see Hudson et al., ). Cellular damage (red squares) is
  detected by D. pulchra R‐proteins, triggering an influx of calcium ions into the
  cell, and eliciting an antipathogen response via calcium signalling and MAPK cascades.
  However, reduced inositol triphosphate levels (InP3) are hypothesized to interfere
  with calcium signalling and downstream antipathogen responses. Downregulation of
  the transcription factor MYB and the small GTPase Rac1 would also probably interfere
  with the expression of genes involved in defence. Suppression of inositol phosphate
  signalling may also interfere with thermal stress resistance. Elevated temperatures
  would probably promote an increase in the concentration of denatured proteins (grey
  lines), which accumulate in the cell due to downregulation of the ubiquitin (Ub)‐mediated
  protein degradation pathway. Likewise, suppression of heat shock proteins Hsp70
  and Hsp90 would also probably contribute to the accumulation of damaged proteins
  and interfere with other cellular processes, including correct protein folding of
  newly synthesized proteins and pathogen defence. Downregulation of the translation
  factor eEF1A, caused by a downregulation of cytoskeleton expression, may interfere
  with the functioning of Hsp70 as well as prevent the synthesis of new proteins.
  Downregulation of photosynthesis‐related proteins components would probably conserve
  ATP, but in the mitochondria downregulation of energy‐generating functions would
  restrict the level of ATP available for defence. Upregulation of a gene involved
  in halogen metabolism is hypothesized to degrade the halogenated furanone defence
  molecules of D. pulchra, leading to an increased susceptibility to infection
