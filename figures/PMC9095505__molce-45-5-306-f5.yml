figure_title: Cell-type specific expression of enriched pathway related genes
caption: Violin plot indicating the expression levels and number of cells expressing
  genes in habenular cell-type clusters from GSE 137478 that are related to (A) neuroactive
  ligand-receptor pathway and (B) trans-synaptic signaling. The colors of the graph
  indicate log2 fold change (FC) of each DEGs.
