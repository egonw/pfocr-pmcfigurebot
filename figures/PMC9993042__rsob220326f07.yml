caption: Schematic of hypothesized Plk1 regulation of cortical polarity establishment.
  Spindle-associated Plk1 is essential for the establishment of cortical polarity
  through the Cdc42 pathway. This is may be via Ran-GTP or other unknown pathways.
  Polarized actin has a negative regulatory feedback loop limiting further accumulation
  of Cdc42/N-Wasp.

  asymmetric division in oocytes.
