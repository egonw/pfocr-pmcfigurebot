caption: ITGA7 regulates cell morphology and osteogenesis in a reciprocal way with
  PI3K-AKT pathway. (A) Relative gene expression of ITGA7, RUNX2, ALP, COL1, OCN in
  3D groups for 3 days. (B) Immunofluorescence staining of RUNX2 and ITGA7 and corresponding
  quantifications (C) of hBMSCs in 3D groups for 3 days. Scale bar = 50 μm. (D) ALP
  staining D) and corresponding quantification (E) in 3D-nHAP groups. Scale bar = 200 μm.
  (F) Representative confocal images of single cell and corresponding quantification
  (G) in 3D groups. Scale bar = 10 μm (n = 3, more than 100 single cells were counted).
  (H) Relative mRNA expression level of ITGA7, RUNX2 and ALP after inhibiting the
  PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. (I) Protein expression level of ITGA7 and p-AKT with
  ITGA7 knockdown or the inhibitor of PI3K-AKT pathway determined by Western blot.
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.
