figure_title: Analysis of cell signaling pathways mediated by the scaffolds during
  the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs
caption: (A) Principal components analysis and (B) t-distributed stochastic neighbor
  embedding (tSNE) cluster analysis of BMSCs cultured on the scaffolds at day 3. (C)
  Volcano plot showing differentially regulated genes in the PEKK-B as compared to
  the PEKK group. Genes with an absolute fold change of >1.5 and a P value of <0.05
  are highlighted in green and red, denoting down- and up-regulated genes, respectively.
  (D) Circular visualization of the results of gene-annotation enrichment analysis.
  (E) Heatmap of genes that were differentially expressed in PEKK-B versus PEKK group
  with a fold change of >1.5 and a P value of <0.05. (F) qRT-PCR validation for representative
  genes (error bars, means ± SD; n = 6 per group; all analyses were done using unpaired
  Student’s t test). *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01.

  with osteoinductivity by activating cAMP/PKA signaling pathway.
