caption: 'Functional protein association network (interactome) diagram of Myo9a. The
  interaction analysis of myo9a (green arrow) shows that there is evidence of interaction
  with recognized members of the Rho/ROCK signaling pathway, among which RhoA (pink
  arrow) stands out, and that it also includes upstream components such as Arhgef11
  (blue arrow), a guanosine exchange factor. Lines of different colors indicate the
  type of evidence of the interaction. The green and red colors of the components
  indicate two levels of clustering. The permalink to access the diagram is: https://version-11-5.string-db.org/cgi/network?networkId=b8BzUXMHHAIQ,
  accessed on 11 May 2023.'
