caption: 'Microbial systems producing vanillin and raspberry ketone. (a) Four metabolically
  engineered Escherichia coli strains from left to right: recombinant strain harbouring
  a pathway for production of vanillic acid from glucose with subsequent in vitro
  reduction of vanillic acid to vanillin by carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) (Li and
  Frost, ); strain in which genes that encode aldo‐keto reductases and alcohol dehydrogenases
  (Δrd/de) were deleted together with the introduction of a pathway for the biosynthesis
  of vanillin from glucose (Kunjapur et al., ); strain harbouring a pathway mimicking
  vanillin biosynthesis in plants capable of using L‐tyrosine, glucose, xylose or
  glycerol as substrates (Ni et al., ); strain harbouring enzymes for raspberry ketone
  production from fatty acids (Chang et al., ). (b) Metabolically engineered Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe containing the complete pathway for raspberry
  ketone and vanillin β‐D‐glycoside biosynthesis from glucose (Hansen et al., ; Lee
  et al., ). Abbreviations: 3dsd, 3‐dehydroshikimate dehydratase; aroB, 3‐dehydroquinate
  synthase; aroE, shikimate dehydrogenase; aroF/G, 3‐deoxy‐D‐arabinoheptulosonate
  7‐phosphate synthase; aroZ/asbF, 3‐dehydroshikimate dehydratase; car, carboxylic
  acid reductase; ech, enoyl‐CoA hydratase/aldolase; fcs, trans‐feruloyl‐CoA synthetase;
  omt, O‐methyltransferase; peps, phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase; pptase, phosphopantetheinyl
  transferase; tkt, transketolase; tyrA, chorismate mutase/prephenate dehydrogenase;
  tyrR, a regulatory protein; ugt, UDP‐glucuronosyltransferase.'
