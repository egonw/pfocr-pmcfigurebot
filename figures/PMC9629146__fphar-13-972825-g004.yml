caption: Licoricidin prevented MGC-803 cell xenografted tumor growth in vivo. (A)
  Models of the MGC-803 cell xenografted tumor in nude mice, divided into four groups
  (n = 6). After the xenografted tumor models were established successfully, we administered
  an intraperitoneal injection of normal saline, licoricidin 10 mg/kg, licoricidin
  20 mg/kg, or 5-fluorouracil 20 mg/kg once every 2 days in the corresponding groups.
  Nude mouse weight (B) and tumor volume (C) were measured once every 3 days. The
  course of treatment was 15 days in total, and then all mice were euthanized after
  3 days. (D) Macroscopic appearance of xenografted tumors. (E) Tumors were weighed
  after they were removed from the bodies. Values are expressed as mean ± SD, *p <
  0.05 and **p < 0.01. LCD, licoricidin. 5-FU, 5-fluorouracil.
