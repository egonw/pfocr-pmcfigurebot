caption: Changes of DAPI and TUNEL staining from representative sections in the hypothalamus
  of gibel carp in the normal group and hypoxia group after 56 days of feeding with
  VC. Positive apoptotic nuclei in green and normal nuclei are shown in blue. The
  magnification and scale of the microscope were 200× and 100 μm, respectively. The
  ** at the top of the bar chart indicates significant differences between treatments;
  ** indicates an extremely significant difference (p < 0.01). All of the data are
  presented as the mean ± standard error (n = 6).
