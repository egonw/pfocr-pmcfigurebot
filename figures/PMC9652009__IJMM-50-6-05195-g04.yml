caption: 'STAT1 inhibition alleviates HP-induced VSMC calcification via the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway. VSMCs were treated with si-STAT1 and si-NC and then incubated
  with HP (3 mM) to induce calcification or fresh conditioned medium (Ctrl) for 7
  days. (A) Effect of si-STAT1 on protein levels of STAT1. Based on the knockdown
  effect, si-STAT1-01 was selected for further experiments. (B) Expression levels
  of OPN and Runx2 were measured by western blot analysis in VSMCs. (C) RT-qPCR analysis
  of OPN and Runx2 mRNA expression in VSMCs. (D) Alizarin Red S staining indicated
  the mineralization. Scale bar, 100 µm. (E) Ca content in VSMCs was measured. (F)
  ALP activity was tested. (G) Expression levels of Wnt-3a and β-catenin were measured
  by western blot analysis. (H) RT-qPCR analysis of Wnt-3a and β-catenin expression
  in VSMCs. **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001 compared with the Ctrl group. #P<0.05,
  ##P<0.01, ###P<0.001, ####P<0.0001 compared with the HP group. ALP, alkaline phosphatase;
  Ca, calcium; Ctrl, control; HP, high phosphorus; NC, negative control; OPN, osteopontin;
  RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR; Runx2, runt-related transcription
  factor 2; si, small interfering RNA; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell.'

  cells induces vascular smooth muscle cell calcification via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway.
