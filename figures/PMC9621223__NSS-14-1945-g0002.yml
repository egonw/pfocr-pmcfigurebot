caption: Principal molecular mechanisms of penile erection, and possible targets by
  which short sleep duration impairing the erectile function.The molecular mechanisms
  of penile erection involve a balance of signaling between relaxation and contraction
  of CCSMC. Generally, the NOS-NO-cGMP signaling pathway is considered as the most
  important mechanism of penile erection, involving the PKG activation and decreased
  intracellular levels of calcium. On the contrary, penile flaccidity is mainly regulated
  by the NA, ET-1, and AngII signaling, involving increasing levels of intracellular
  calciumÂ . Meanwhile, RhoA/ROCK signaling known as the calcium-sensitized pathway,
  and NA-ADRa1 signaling are crucial to regulate the chronic contraction of CCSMC.
  In all, ROCK deactivates the MLCP by phosphorylating MYPT1, or directly phosphorylates
  the MLC2, promoting the contraction of CCSMC. Additionally, the adenosine signaling
  pathway also has a role in the regulation of erectile function. In short, the short
  sleep duration might break the balance between the signaling pathways associated
  with penile erection and flaccidity, resulting in ED.
