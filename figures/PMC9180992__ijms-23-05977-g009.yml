caption: Immunofluorescence analysis of microfibrillar network assembly in response
  to retinoic acid pathway inhibition and activation. (A) Immunolabeling for fibrillin-1
  (green fluorescence) in cultures of human Tenon’s capsule fibroblasts (hTCF) treated
  with 5 µM of BMS 493 (pan-RAR antagonist), 2 µM all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA),
  5 ng/mL transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), 5 ng/mL TGF-β1 together with 2 µM
  ATRA, or 10 µM of LGD 1069 (pan-RXR agonist) for 7 days; untreated cells served
  as control; nuclear counterstaining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, blue
  fluorescence). (B) Quantitative analysis of fluorescence intensity of fibrillin-1
  staining across whole images (n = 20 per group). Data are expressed as means ± SD
  (** p < 0.01, **** p < 0.0001; unpaired t-test). (C) Transmission electron micrographs
  showing the production of microfibrils (Mf) by hTCF cultivated in 3D collagen (Co)
  gels following treatment with 5 ng/mL TGF-β1 for 10 days. The addition of 2 µM ATRA
  to TGF-β1 inhibited the deposition of microfibrils within the collagen gels.
