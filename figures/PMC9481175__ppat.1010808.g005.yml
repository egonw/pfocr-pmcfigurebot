figure_title: WSSV infection activates the mTORC1 signaling pathway through viral
  receptor, pIgR
caption: (A) The efficiency of pIgR-RNAi in the hemocytes and intestines of shrimp
  analyzed by qPCR at 24 h post dsRNA injection. An injection with dsGfp was used
  as the control. (B) The level of mRNA expression of the downstream effectors of
  mTORC1, S6k1 and S6k2, in the hemocytes of pIgR-knockdown shrimp, based on three
  independent experiments analyzed by qPCR at 36 hpi. (C and D) The level of VP28
  expression and 4EBP1 phosphorylation in the hemocytes (C) and intestines (D) of
  pIgR-RNAi shrimp with or without WSSV infection as analyzed by Western blot at 36
  hpi. The upper panel represents the statistical analysis of three independent experiments
  of the lower panel. (E) The level of p-S6K1 in the hemocytes of pIgR-RNAi shrimp
  with or without WSSV challenge analyzed by Western blot at 36 hpi. The upper panel
  represents the statistical analysis of three independent western blot analyses.
  (F) The level of AKT phosphorylation in the hemocytes of pIgR-RNAi shrimp with or
  without WSSV challenge analyzed by Western blot at 36 hpi. The upper panel represents
  the statistical analysis of three independent experiments of the lower panel. In
  panel C-F, the subpanels of VP28/p-S6K1/pAKT and ACTB were from different gels with
  same amount of loading samples. Significant differences were analyzed using a Studentâ€™s
  t-test, P < 0.05 was considered to indicate a significant difference; different
  lowercase letters indicate significant differences (P < 0.05) in the one-way ANOVA
  analysis.
