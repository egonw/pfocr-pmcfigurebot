caption: Effects of HOBX9 on TGF-β1 signaling pathway in the tissues from xenograft
  in nude mice. (A–B) Immunohistochemistry was used to reveal the effect of HOXB9
  overexpression or knockdown on p-Smad2 expression in the tissues from xenograft
  in nude mice (200× magnification for the whole picture and 400× magnification for
  that at top right corner). (C–D) Western blot analysis was used to determine the
  changes of TGF-β1 signaling pathway (including Smad7, Smurf2, TGF-β1, and p-Smad2)
  in the tissues from xenograft in nude mice with HOXB9 overexpression or knockdown.
  (E) Immunofluorescence was performed to evaluate the effect of HOXB9 overexpression
  or knockdown on p-Smad2 expression in nucleus of HCC cells. ∗P < 0.05 vs. BEL-7405-pBabe
  group; ∗∗P < 0.05 vs. HepG-Super group.
