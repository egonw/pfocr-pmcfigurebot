caption: 'Inhibitory effect of NP-2007 on MAPK pathway in RAW 264.7 cells. (A) MAPK
  signaling pathways were determined via Western blotting. SDS-PAGE effectively processed
  equivalent amounts of total proteins. (B) Quantitative analysis of blots. The densitometry
  results are represented as the relative protein band densities normalized to the
  β-actin level. The total ERK, JNK, or p38 is shown as a loading control. All values
  represent the mean ± SD. Data were examined using Duncan’s multiple comparison test.
  *** p < 0.001 vs. control group; # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, and ### p < 0.001 vs.
  LPS group.'
