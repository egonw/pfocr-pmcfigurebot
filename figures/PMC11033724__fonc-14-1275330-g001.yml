caption: 'Eph signaling, and pathways involved in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression.
  Eph receptors participate in intricate crosstalk with various oncogenic pathways,
  crucially shaping the initiation and perpetuation of CRC. Upon ligand binding, Eph
  receptors can initiate “forward signaling,” influencing cell repulsion, migration,
  and invasion—key processes in CRC metastasis. Additionally, EphB receptors can engage
  in “reverse signaling,” transmitting signals to neighboring or ligand-expressing
  cells, thereby impacting cell adhesion, migration, and tissue architecture, further
  influencing CRC progression. Eph receptors are involved in the activation of the
  MAPK pathway, a signaling cascade pivotal for regulating cell growth, proliferation,
  and survival. This interaction often promotes tumor growth and metastasis in CRC.
  Furthermore, Eph receptors modulate the WNT/β-catenin pathway, a central player
  in CRC pathogenesis. Dysregulation of WNT/β-catenin signaling, along with the JAK-STAT
  pathway, can fuel aberrant cell proliferation and contribute to CRC formation. Moreover,
  Eph receptors activate the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway, closely
  linked to cell survival, growth, and angiogenesis. Dysregulation of this pathway
  may fuel CRC development and confer resistance to therapy. Understanding the intricate
  interplay between Eph signaling and these pathways is paramount in deciphering the
  complexities of CRC progression and may offer promising targets for therapeutic
  intervention. Detailed structural analysis of Eph receptors reveals three distinct
  regions: (1) Extracellular region, comprising a ligand-binding domain, cysteine-rich
  domain, and two fibronectin-III like domains; (2) Transmembrane domain; and (3)
  Intracellular region, consisting of a kinase domain, sterile alpha motif (SAM),
  and a PDZ binding motif. Both ephrinA (anchored by GPI) and ephrinB (transmembrane)
  ligands engage with the ligand-binding domain of the Eph receptor.'
