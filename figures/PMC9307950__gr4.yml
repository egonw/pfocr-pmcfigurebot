caption: Sex hormone pathways and their impacts on immunityCanonical ER and AR signaling
  pathways that are more prevalent in females and males, respectively. Boxed list
  refers to changes in immune cell subsets by estrogen (magenta) or androgens (blue).
  Magenta and blue arrows denote positive and negative changes in response to estrogen
  or androgens, respectively. The lack of an arrow indicates there is either no change
  or it has not been evaluated. Right section includes compounds known to inhibit
  various nodes of the AR signaling pathway. LH, luteinizing hormone. FSH, follicle-stimulating
  hormone. LHRH, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone. E, estrogen. GPER, G protein-coupled
  estrogen receptor. T, testosterone. DHT, dihydrotestosterone. HSP, heat shock protein.
  ERE, estrogen response element. ARE, androgen response element. DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone.
  AD, androstenediol/androstenedione. SHBG, sex hormone binding globulin. Figure adapted
  from images created with BioRender.com.
