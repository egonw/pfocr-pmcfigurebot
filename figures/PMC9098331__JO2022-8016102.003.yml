caption: Effects of HOXC6 on the clonogenicity and proliferation of GBM cells. (a)
  The CCK-8 assay showed that HOXC6 inhibited the proliferation of glioma in U87 and
  U251 cell lines. (b, c) In the plate cloning experiment, the proliferation of U87
  and U251 glioma cells in the siNC group was significantly higher compared to the
  siRNA1 and siRNA2 groups. ∗p < 0.05,  ∗∗p < 0.01, and∗∗∗p < 0.001. Data are shown
  as means ± SD.
