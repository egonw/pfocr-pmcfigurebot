caption: Esculetin induces the apoptosis of A253 cells by regulating the expression
  levels of apoptosis-related proteins. (A) Relative protein levels were assessed
  using western blot analysis. Treatment of A253 cells with different doses of esculetin
  (0, 50, 100 and 150 µM) for 24 and 48 h. (B) Relative expression of apoptotic proteins
  to β-actin. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (n=3; *P<0.05 and
  **P<0.01 vs. untreated control group). PARP, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase.
