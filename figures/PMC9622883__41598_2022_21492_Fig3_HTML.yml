caption: 'Interrogation of the ATM/p38 MAPK and p53 signaling pathway in GC. Ectopic
  expression (E1) represents gain-of-function (GoF) while knockdown (KO) represents
  loss-of-function (LoF) of the respective network element. The leftmost column shows
  the level of DNA damage with other molecules separated by a pink line. In contrast,
  the rightmost columns show the model outputs: proliferation, cell cycle arrest,
  and apoptosis. Each line represents a fixed point or steady state corresponding
  to the input. Light purple cells indicate a zero value (inactivation), while dark
  purple cells indicate activation (value 1). The first two fixed points are related
  to loss-of-function (LoF) of p53, that is, all node knockdown (KO) of p53. As you
  can see, only the ATM/p38 MAPK pathway is activated and triggers cell cycle arrest
  and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. The next two fixed points are described
  as loss-of-function (LoF) of p38 MAPK, that is, induction of proliferation. Apparently,
  the first fixed point knockdown (KO) of p38 MAPK represents a proliferation state
  due to the inactivation of DNA damage. Even in the presence of DNA damage, knockdown
  (KO) of p38 MAPK accelerated proliferation due to activation of cell cycle promoters
  such as E2F1, Myc, and CDK-cyclin complex. As you can see, loss-of-function (LoF)
  of p38 MAPK in response to DNA damage, lncRNA-GAS5 expression is accelerated but
  fails to trigger cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis except in the proliferation
  state. After that, the other two fixed points represent the gain-of-function (GoF)
  of p38 MAPK, which means cell cycle arrest and apoptosis as well as activation of
  the p53 pathway. The ensuing fixed points are associated with gain-of-function (GoF)
  of p38 MAPK as well as loss-of-function of p53. Clearly, activation of the expression
  of the lncRNA-GAS5, miR-34c, p21, and RB1 triggers arrest and apoptosis (independently
  of p53). The other two following fixed points indicate the knockdown (KO) of ATM.
  Equally, this was observed in the loss-of-function (LoF) of p38MAPK. This means
  that at a certain point in the absence of DNA damage and another in response to
  DNA damage triggered proliferation; similarly, the lncRNA GAS was activated but
  refused to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis-like phenotypes. The other two
  fixed points of ATM represent the gain-of-function (GOF) of ATM, and then, more
  two fixed points (at last) represent the overexpression (E1) of ATM with p53 KO
  (knockdown), i.e., expression of the lncRNA-GAS5, miR-34c, p21, and RB1, induces
  cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (independently of p53). Yellow arrows represent
  upregulation, while the red arrows facing down represent downregulation, respectively.'
