caption: Melatonin can suppress the NLRP3 inflammasome in mice spinal cords near the
  injury site, 3 days after SCI, by activating the Nrf2/ARE pathway. (A,B) The nuclear
  Nrf2 in the spinal cord of mice in groups was detected by Western blotting (n =
  8). (C–I) The levels of HO-1, NQO-1, NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, and IL-1β in the spinal
  cord tissue of mice in groups were detected by Western blotting (n = 6). Data are
  shown as the means ± SD; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
