caption: Pharmacological inhibition of XBP1 ameliorates liver fibrosis in mice.(A)
  Schematic showing the administration protocol for toyocamycin in CCl4-, BDL-, and
  MCD-induced murine liver fibrosis models for the experiments shown in (B), PBS administration
  was used as control. (B) WT male mice were subjected to CCl4-, BDL-, or MCD-induced
  experimental fibrosis and injected intraperitoneally with toyocamycin; the livers
  were collected and subjected to H&E and Sirius Red staining and α-SMA immunohistochemical
  analysis; scale bar = 100 μm. Representative of 6 mice/group. (C,D) The proportions
  of the Sirius Red- and α-SMA-positive areas were quantified; n = 6 mice/group. (E)
  The expression levels of Acta2, Col1a1, and Timp1 in liver tissue from WT mice with
  fibrosis treated with toyocamycin were examined using quantitative real-time PCR;
  n = 6 mice/group. (F) Schematic illustration of how XBP1 controls macrophage self-mtDNA
  cytosolic leakage and STING activation during liver fibrosis. The values are shown
  as the mean ± SD. Statistical significance was assessed by ANOVA. ∗∗p <0.01. Acta2/α-SMA,

  Col1a1, collagen, type I, alpha 1; MCD, methionine/choline-deficient diet; STING,
