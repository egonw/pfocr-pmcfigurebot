caption: Graphic representation of cells in the brain. Nerve mRNAs and RBPs are transferred
  from the nucleus via the axon (exosomal pathway, anterograde), and glial mRNAs and
  RBPs are transferred from the extracellular space to the nucleus (endosomal pathway,
  retrograde). Dysregulation of APP/Aβ, TAU, and APOE functions are the basic three
  characteristics of AD. Due to the dysregulation of these three genes/proteins, disruption
  of axonal transport can be observed in AD.
