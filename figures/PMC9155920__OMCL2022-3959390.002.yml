caption: 'The crosstalk between Nrf2 and NF-κB signaling pathway (created with BioRender.com).
  (a) Nrf2-dependent antioxidant genes could block TLR and TNF-dependent signaling.
  (b) Nrf2 and NQO1 inhibit the priming step of NLRP3, and suppress caspase-1 cleavage
  and IL-1β generation. (c) Keap1 could ubiquitinate IKK and be targeted by 15d-PGJ2.
  (d) Nrf2 and NF-κB could compete to combine with CBP. Nrf2: nuclear factor erythroid-2
  related factor 2; NF-κB: nuclear factor-κB; HO-1: heme oxygenase-1; NQO1: NAD(P)H
  quinone dehydrogenase-1; TLR: toll-like receptors; TNFR: tumor necrosis factor receptor;
  NLRP3: nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3; IL-1β:
  interleukin-1β; Keap1: kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1; IKK: inhibitors of NF-κB
  kinase; CBP: cAMP-response-element-binding protein-binding protein.'
