caption: Model for P-selectin-mediated activation via a non-conventional signal pathway.
  In flow, P-selectin on activated endothelial cells or platelets engaged with PSGL-1
  on neutrophils to initiate integrin activation signaling via MAPK pathway, which
  includes signaling components, such as lipid rafts, three SFKs (Hck, Lyn, Fgr),
  ITAM adaptors (DAP12 and FcRγ), Syk, Btk, PLCγ2, CalDAG-GEFI, Rap 1a-GTP, and talin-1,
  and requires intracellular Ca2+ release instead of extracellular Ca2+ influx, as
  shown in previous work (–, , –). Through the MAPK pathway, P-selectin-mediated extending
  of integrin over entire cell surface has a timescale of minutes. And, integrin expanding
  via non-MAPK signal firstly ensues from P-selectin/PSGL-1 signaling of sub-seconds
  and occurs at the ligated PSGL-1 neighborhood. Liquid raft, moesin, actin, and talin-1
  were involved in the non-MAPK signaling with a subsecond timescale. Binding of the
  freshly extended β2 integrin near ligated PSGL-1 to ICAM-1 on endothelial cell or
  GPIbα on platelet initiates calcium signaling via extracellular Ca2+ influx instead
  of intracellular Ca2+ release, mediating subsequent extending of integrin over entire
  cell surface within 1-2 minutes. The calcium signaling via either extracellular
  Ca2+ influx or intracellular Ca2+ release has a timescale of a few minutes, like
  the global integrin activation.
