caption: A schematic model for the pathway involved in the regulation of REGγ and
  tau.A, Psme3 mRNA level was downregulated in the hippocampal tissues of mice aged
  24 months with a concomitant upregulation of Cebpb and Tgfbr2 mRNA levels. Hippocampal
  tissues of mice aged 24 and 3 months were subjected to quantitative real-time PCR
  (qRT-PCR) analysis. Relative mRNA levels of these factors were compared between
  tissues from 3-month-old and 24-month-old mice (mean ± SEM; n = 3; ∗∗∗p < 0.001;
  3 m versus 24 m). B, transient expression of CEBPB upregulated the TGFBR2 mRNA levels
  and downregulated the PSME3 mRNA levels in SH-SY5Y cells. SH-SY5Y cells transfected
  with CEBPB-encoding or control plasmid were subjected to qRT-PCR to determine the
  levels of the indicated genes. Data are represented as mean ± SEM from three independent
  experiments (∗∗p < 0.01 and ∗∗∗p < 0.001. CEBPB-transfected group versus control-transfected
  group). All data are representative of three independent repeats. C, ChIP assays
  were performed to substantiate in vivo binding of C/EBPβ to the TGFβR2 promoter
  in SH-SY5Y cell line, two pairs of primers in the binding enrichment locus were
  used (upper and lower panels). D, ChIP assays were performed to substantiate in vivo
  binding of Smad3 to the REGγ promoter in SH-SY5Y cell line with TGFβ or C/EBPβ,
  two pairs of primers (upper panel is for Smad3-binding region in REGγ promoter,
  lower panel is ∼2 Kb upstream of REGγ promoter). E, a model depicting the regulation
  of REGγ and tau. Highly activated C/EBPβ in senescent cells, such as those in AD,
  aging, and tauopathy are associated with a concomitant upregulation of TGFBRs, especially
  TGFBR2. TGFβ signaling may promote REGγ downregulation. Lack of REGγ promotes the
  accumulation of tau and p-tau, which leads to tau hyperphosphorylation, formation
  of neurofibrillary tangles and tau oligomers, and neuron loss in neurodegenerative
  mouse models. ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation.
