caption: TXNIP promoter sequence (+162/+218) and the effect of taurine on TXNIP promoter
  activity by employing site-directed mutagenesis. (A) Human TXNIP promoter sequences
  between +162 and +218 are shown. The sequence of putative Tst-1 and Ets-1 response
  sequences and their mutants are shown, respectively. (B,C) Caco-2 cells were transfected
  with a reporter vector containing the partial promoter region of TXNIP (−39/+256;
  wild type, Tst-1 mutant, Ets-1 mutant) and then replaced with the medium containing
  100 mM of taurine. After 24 h, the cells were subjected to the luciferase assay.
  Results are expressed as relative values with the control value of mock as 1. Each
  value is the mean ± S.E. (n = 4) and the abcd values indicated by different characters
  are significantly different from each other and the abcd values indicated by the
  same characters are not significantly different (Tukey’s test; p < 0.05).
