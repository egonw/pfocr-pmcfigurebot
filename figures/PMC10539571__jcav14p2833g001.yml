caption: 'PRMT7 is expressed at low levels in gastric cancer tissues. A Immunohistochemical
  analyses were performed to observe PRMT7 expression in gastric cancer: a) normal
  gastric tissue; b) high-medium differentiated gastric cancer tissue; c) poorly differentiated
  gastric cancer tissue. B Western blot analysis of PRMT7 protein expression levels
  in 30 paired gastric cancer tissues and adjacent normal mucosal tissues. N: normal
  mucosa adjacent to cancer; T: tumor tissue. C PRMT7 expression in the GES-1 cell
  line and various gastric cancer cell lines. ***P < 0.001.'
