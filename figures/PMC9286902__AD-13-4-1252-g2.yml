caption: Overview of the effects of SCFAs in Alzheimer's disease. SCFAs from the gut
  microbiota enter the CNS by crossing the blood-brain barrier. They act on neurons
  to promote neuronal repair and regeneration through upregulation of the CREB/BDNF
  signaling pathway and expression of memory-consolidation genes. In addition, the
  secretion of inflammatory factors is reduced by inhibiting the MAPK, NF-κB, and
  other pathways in disease-related microglia and astrocytes with proinflammatory
  effects. SCFAs also participate in the pathological regulation of Aβ and tau proteins,
  ultimately ameliorating cognitive impairment in AD. CREB, cyclic-AMP response element
  binding protein; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB;
  MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase
