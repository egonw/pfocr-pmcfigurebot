figure_title: 'Screened herbal extracts increased lipid synthesis via the adiponectin
  signaling pathway in keratinocytes. (A~C) Lipid quantification (cholesterol, fatty
  acids, ceramides, sphingosine, and sphingosine-1-phosphate) was performed by high-performance
  liquid chromatography in HEKs after 24 hours of treatment with adiponectin (10 µg/ml)
  or herbal extracts (10 ppm). (D~E) Quantitative real-time PCR of major lipid synthesis
  enzymes and their regulatory factors in adiponectin or herbal extract treated HEKs.
  (F) PCR results of the expression of epidermal differentiation markers (filaggrin,
  involucrin, and loricrin). Values are presented as mean±standard deviation (*p<0.05,
  **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 versus control; †p<0.05 vs. adiponectin). HEK: human epidermal
  keratinocyte, NS: non-hydroxy sphingosine, NP: non-hydroxy phytosphingosine, AS:
  alpha-hydroxy sphingosine, SIRT: sirtuin, SREBP: sterol regulatory element-binding
  protein'
