caption: 'Fetuin-A treatment inhibits microglial activation and ameliorates inflammatory
  response after CCI. The mice were treated with Fetuin-A at indicated concentrations
  after TBI. A, B Immunohistochemistry assessment of Iba-1 in sham or CCI at 6 h and
  statistical analysis of Iba-1. Reduced process length, branch endpoint and swollen
  soma were observed in CCI-induced microglial cells (scale bar = 50 μm, n = 3). C,
  D Western blot analysis of Iba-1 expression from peri-contusional area. GAPDH was
  used as the loading control. And bar graphs show the results of analysis (by band
  density analysis) of these proteins (n = 3). E, F The co-localization of CD16/32
  with Iba-1 by immunofluorescence assay with representative imaging and statistical
  analysis. Scale bar is 50 μm (n = 3). G IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-10 secretion
  was measured using ELISA (n = 7). H, I Immunofluorescence for MPO in the peri-contusional
  area and statistical analysis of MPO (scale bar is 100 μm, n = 3). Data are presented
  as the means ± SD; *P < 0.05 vs. sham group, **P < 0.01 vs. sham group, #P < 0.05
  vs. CCI group'
