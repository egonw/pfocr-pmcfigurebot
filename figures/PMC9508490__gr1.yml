caption: UpSet Plot showing the classification of studies characterizing single-cell
  EC heterogeneity with respect to the applied computational techniques. A total of
  87 studies detailed in , characterize single-cell EC heterogeneity with the distribution
  of studies that use different task-specific computational techniques. Performing
  differential expression of biomolecular abundances between conditions and subsequent
  coupling with functional enrichment techniques are commonly used to discover novel
  biological knowledge in single-cell ECs (82 studies). This is followed by the use
  of biological network inference techniques to identify novel biomolecular interactions
  from changes in gene expression (18 studies). Within biological network inference
  approaches, most studies intend to predict cell–cell communication through ligand-receptor
  interactions followed by inference of gene-regulatory networks. Only one study focused
  on predicting varying pathway activity using genome-scale metabolic networks. Also,
  biological network inference studies are only used complementary to functional enrichment
  techniques (overlap between biological network-based studies and functional enrichment).
  Among integration-based approaches, most studies fuse single-cell transcriptomes
  from multiple datasets laterally as compared to vertical fusion of multiple omics
  data types. Automated gene-prioritization for the identification of AAT targets
  is the least explored (only 3 studies have attempted prioritization of genes). The
  bar plot in the bottom left shows comparison of the number of studies which use
  a particular technique. The bar plots on the top indicate the number of studies
  that have used a combination of different tools for analysis. The filled dots and
  lines in the matrix visually represent studies that use different combinations of
  the tools enlisted in the rows.
