figure_title: mtDNA acts as a DAMP to activate neuroinflammation
caption: Mitochondrial dysfunction causes mtDNA to flow into the cytoplasm and out
  of glia (the left cell). mtDNA in the cytoplasm is sensed by the cGAS-STING signaling
  pathway, which induces TBK1-IRF3-IFN signaling and promotes the expression of inflammatory
  factors. mtDNA in the cytoplasm can also activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and promote
  the expression of IL-18 and IL-1β by activating caspase-1. Extracellular mtDNA activates
  TLR9 on the endosomes of other glia (the right cell) to initiate nuclear transcription
  factor NF-κB signaling.
