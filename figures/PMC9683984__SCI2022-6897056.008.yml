caption: 'Effects of stem cell transplantation and Wnt signaling pathway inhibition
  on nerve repairing. (a) PMSC treatment activates β-catenin on 28 days. There was
  more increase in DVL1 in the PMSC group on 14 days. PMSCs decrease Bax on 7, 14,
  and 28 days. LGK974 inhibited β-catenin on 28 days and decreased DVL1 on 14 days.
  (b, c) Quantification of western blot bands of DVL1 and β-catenin was summarized.
  Data were expressed as the mean ± SEM. n = 3 independent experiment; ∗PMSC group
  vs. control group, P < 0.05; #PMSC group vs. PMSC+LGK974 group, P < 0.05. All samples
  were taken from the sciatic nerve.'
