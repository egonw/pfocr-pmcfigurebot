caption: 'TP regulates HMC autophagy and proliferation by CARD9. Representative western
  blots of CARD9 (A) and quantitative analysis of CARD9 mRNA and protein levels (B).
  Representative western blots (C) and quantitative analysis (D) of PCNA, cyclin D1,
  P62, and LC3 II in CARD9‐knockdown HMCs. (E) Cell viability was assessed by CCK8
  assay. (F,G) Flow cytometry analysis of cell cycle. The proliferation index is calculated
  as the sum of the percentages of cells in S phase and G2/M phase. Representative
  western blots (H) and quantitative analysis (I) of PCNA, cyclin D1, P62, and LC3
  II in CARD9‐overexpression HMCs. (J) Cell viability was assessed by CCK8 assay.
  (K,L) Flow cytometry analysis of cell cycle. All data presented as mean ± SD, n = 3.
