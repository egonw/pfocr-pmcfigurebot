caption: The ectopically expressed I10L protein inhibits the TNF-α- and IL-1β-triggered
  NF-κB signaling pathway. (A) PK-15 cell lines stably expressing the ASFV pI10L were
  successfully established. The PK-15 cell lines stably expressing the ASFV I10L protein
  or harboring the empty vector were lysed and the expression of pI10L was measured
  through immunoblotting. (B) The ASFV pI10L is localized in both the cytoplasm and
  the nucleus of the infected cells. The PK-15 cell lines stably expressing the ASFV
  pI10L or harboring Vec were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and subjected for confocal
  microscopy. (C) The ASFV pI10L inhibits the TNF-α- and IL-1β-triggered transcription
  of proinflammatory cytokines in PK-15 cells. The PK-15 cell lines stably expressing
  the ASFV pI10L or harboring Vec were treated with TNF-α (10 ng/mL) or IL-1β (10
  ng/mL) for 10 hours, and then total RNA was prepared for RT-qPCR assay. (D) The
  ASFV pI10L inhibits the TNF-α- and IL-1β-triggered phosphorylation of IκBα and p65
  in PK-15 cells. The PK-15 cell lines stably expressing the ASFV pI10L or harboring
  Vec were treated with TNF-α (20 ng/mL) or IL-1β (20 ng/mL) for 5 or 10 minutes,
  after which the cells were lysed and immunoblotting analysis was performed. Densitometric
  analysis of protein expression level was performed with ImageJ software. Data shown
  are the mean ± SD from one representative experiment performed in triplicates. ***P
  < 0.001 (unpaired t test).
