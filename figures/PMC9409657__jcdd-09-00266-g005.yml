caption: '(A) The representative protein levels of SIRT1, PGC-1, BcL-2, and BcL-xL
  extracted from the left ventricles of excised hearts in the normotensive group (WKY),
  untreated hypertensive group (SHR), and SHR rats with treated irbesartan (SHR-ARB),
  as measured by Western blot methods. α-Tubulin served as an internal control. (B)
  Bars indicate the relative fold changes of protein levels relative to the Control
  group in SIRT1, PGC-1, BcL-2, and BcL-xL based on α-Tubulin and show mean ± standard
  deviation (n = 8;8;8). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01: significant differences from the
  Control group. # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01 indicates significant differences between
  the SHR group and the SHR-ARB group.'
