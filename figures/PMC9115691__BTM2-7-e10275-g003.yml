caption: 'miR‐23a‐3p is involved in LINC00473‐activated PEBP1/Akt/Bad/Bcl‐2 signaling
  pathway axis in Dex‐induced apoptosis of hBMSCs. (a) CCK‐8 assay showing the proliferation
  viability of hBMSCs in each group. (b) Hoechst 33342 staining showing the morphology
  of apoptotic cells in each group under a fluorescence microscope (scale bar = 200 μm).
  (c) Cell count of the percentage of apoptotic cells in each group. Six randomly
  selected fields were quantified, and a total of three hundred cells in each group
  were counted. (d) Flow cytometry of apoptotic cells with Annexin V‐PE and 7‐AAD
  staining: Q1 showing the percentage of necrotic cells, Q2 showing the percentage
  of late apoptotic cells, Q3 showing the percentage of early apoptotic cell, Q4 showing
  the percentage of normal cells. (e) The percentage of Annexin+ cells in Q2 and Q3
  in each group. (f) Western blotting showing the protein expression of p‐Akt, Akt,
  P‐Bad, Bad, Bcl‐2, cleaved‐caspase‐3, caspase‐3, and PEBP1 in each group. (g) The
  quantification of integrated density in target bands normalized to GAPDH. (h) The
  sequences of wild‐type and mutant‐type PEBP1 without miR‐23a‐3p‐binding sites. (i)
  Relative luciferase activities of wild‐type or mutant‐type PEBP1 co‐transfected
  with miR‐23‐3p mimics. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation of three
  independent experiments. (c,e,g) **P < 0.01 compared with the Dex group and the
  Dex + Vector group, ##P < 0.01 compared with the Dex + up‐LINC00473 group and Dex + up‐LINC00473 + miR‐NC
  group. (i) **P < 0.01 compared with the GV272 + miR‐23a‐3p group and PEBP1‐MUT + miR‐23a‐3p
  group. Akt, protein kinase B; Bad, Bcl‐2 associated death promoter; Bcl‐2, B‐cell
  lymphoma 2; CCK‐8, Cell Counting Kit‐8; Dex, dexamethasone; hBMSCs, human‐derived
  bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells; LINC00473, LINCRNA‐00473; miR‐23a‐3p, MicroRNA‐23a‐3p;
  p‐Akt, phosphorylated protein kinase B; p‐Bad, phosphorylated Bcl‐2 associated death
  promoter; Q, quadrant'
