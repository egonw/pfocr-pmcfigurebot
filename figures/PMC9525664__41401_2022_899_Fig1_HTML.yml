figure_title: IMM-H007 inhibits ISO-induced fibrosis and diastolic dysfunction independent
  of AMPKα2 expression
caption: 'a IMM-H007 (200 mg·kg−1·day−1 body weight) was given once per day for 10
  days through oral gavage. ISO (10 mg·kg−1·day−1 body weight, sc) was administered
  once per day for 7 days. b Western blots to measure phosphorylated AMPK, total AMPK,
  and AMPKα2 expression in WT and AMPKα2−/− mice. c Representative micrographs of
  picrosirius red-stained sections of the heart in WT and AMPKα2−/− mice (scale bars:
  1 mm). The mean cardiac interstitial collagen in picrosirius red-stained sections
  is expressed as the percent collagen (lower panels). d Collagen concentration in
  the heart as determined by hydroxyproline assays in WT and AMPKα2−/− mice. e Representative
  images of PWD sonography showing the mitral flow, TD sonography of the mitral valve
  ring, and E/E’ values on the period of 7 days of the ISO treatment in WT and AMPKα2−/−
  mice. n = 6; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test.
  AMPK AMP-activated protein kinase, IMM IMM-H007, ISO isoprenaline, PWD pulsed-wave
  Doppler, TD tissue Doppler, WT wild-type.'
