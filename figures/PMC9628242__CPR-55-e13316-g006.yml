caption: 'tFNAs facilitated diabetic wound healing, and increased epithelialization
  and collagen deposition in diabetic wounds. (A) Photographs of cutaneous wounds
  in diabetic mice treated with saline or 250 nM tFNAs at different time points. The
  scale bar is 5 mm. (B) Calculation and comparison of the wound healing area percentages
  between the control and tFNAs groups at different time points. (C) H&E staining
  of the control and tFNAs groups on day 21 after surgery. Scale bars are 250 or 50 μm.
  (D) Comparison of the average regenerative epidermal thickness between the control
  and tFNAs groups. (E) Comparison of the deposited collagen percentages between the
  control and tFNAs groups. (F) Masson staining of the control and tFNAs groups on
  day 21 after surgery. Scale bars are 250 or 50 μm. (G) Picrosirius red staining
  of the control and tFNAs groups on day 21 after surgery. The scale bar is 25 μm.
  Data are presented as the mean ± SD (n = 4). Significance: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001'
