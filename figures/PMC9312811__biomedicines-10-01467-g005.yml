caption: Chrysin induced autophagic vacuole formation in A375SM and A375P human melanoma
  cancer cells. Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of chrysin for
  24 h. (A) Morphological changes were observed under phase-contrast microscopy. The
  white arrow indicates the autophagic vacuoles. (B) Cells were stained with 5 Âµg/mL
  acridine orange to detect acid vesicle organelles and observed using a fluorescence
  microscope. The cytoplasm and nucleus fluoresce green and the acidic vesicular organelles
  fluoresce red.
