caption: Overview of the gluconeogenesis and glycolysis pathways. Glycolysis is a
  pathway with 10 reactions, with a final production of pyruvate. Three reactions
  catalysed by hexokinase/glucokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase are
  rate limited. Gluconeogenesis is the reversed reaction of glycolysis, with four
  specific reactions catalysed by G6Pase, FBP1, PEPCK and PC.
