caption: 'Expression of CD6 and ALCAM in patients afer hematopoietic cell transplantation
  with and without acute graf-versus-host disease. (A) Levels of CD6 expression (median
  fluorescence intensity [MFI]) in Treg, Tcon and CD8 T cells. (B) Levels of ALCAM
  expression (MFI) in CD4 regulatory T cells (Treg), conventional CD4 T cells (Tcon)
  and CD8 T cells. Before graft-versus-host disease (preGvHD) samples (green boxes)
  and after GvHD (postGvHD) samples (red boxes) from patients who developed acute
  GvHD are compared with noGvHD samples obtained at different times after transplant
  (grey boxes) and healthy donors (HD) (blue boxes). Statistically significant differences
  are noted: ***P<0.001; **P<0.01; *P<0.05; Wilcoxon rank-sum test. HD n=9, preGVHD
  n=30, postGVHD n=20, noGVHD 1 month (1m) n=38, 2 months (2m) n=40, 3 months (3m)
  n=43 and 6 months (6m) n=21.'
