caption: Calycosin maintains intestinal mucosal barrier integrity of rats with gastrectomy
  through activating the occludin/claudin/ZO-1 signaling pathway. (a–c) The mRNA level
  of occludin, claudin, or ZO-1 in the intestinal tissues of control, sham, model,
  and 20, 40, or 80 mg/kg calycosin group (∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001).
  (d–g) The protein level of occludin, claudin, or ZO-1 in intestinal tissues of control,
  sham, model, and 20, 40, or 80 mg/kg calycosin group (∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001).
