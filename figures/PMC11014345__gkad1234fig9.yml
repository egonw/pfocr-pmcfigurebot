caption: 'The RcsA transcription factor complements the toxic YdaT phenotype, suggesting
  their possible common interaction within the pathway leading to lipopolysaccharide
  biosynthesis. (A) Growth of MG1655rac+ cells when ydaT expression is low. The effect
  is alleviated when rscA is inactive (MG1655rac+rcsA::bla). The averages (± SD) are
  shown with Student''s t-test: P *** P<0.0001; * P<0.05. (B) In contrast, only overexpression
  of two genes at the same time: ydaT and rcsA in rcsA::bla background restores the
  initial filamentous cell phenotype. (C) Overexpression of rcsA gene alone yields
  a mucoid, shiny colony morphology. (D) Miller assay showing increased rcsA promoter
  activity under ydaT induction. The error bars indicate the averages (± SD) of at
  least three independent measurements. Student''s t-test was performed with values:
  *** P<0.0001; * P<0.05 and ns: P>0.05. (E) Bacteriophage test on cells under ydaT
  overexpression: P1vir (left) and λvir (right). Serially diluted phages and the same
  amount of cells were spotted onto LB-agar plates. For λvir the efficiency of lysis
  is unchanged upon ydaT induction (in comparison to the empty vector (V) control).
  For P1vir recognition receptor is a terminal glucose moiety of the lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) for which synthesis is disturbed during ydaT induction.'

  by a restriction-modification system's regulator and can be mitigated by excision
  of the cryptic prophage Rac.
