caption: ZQL-4c induces reactive oxygen species production in breast cancer cells.
  MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and SK-BR-3 cells were treated with 0, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 μmol/L
  ZQL-4c for 24 h. Cells were loaded with 10 μmol/L DCFH-DA for 20 min. The nuclei
  were stained with Hoechst 33342. The level of ROS production was detected by fluorescence
  microscopy (a) and flow cytometry (b).
