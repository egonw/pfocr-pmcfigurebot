caption: Effect of sodium selenite in osteoblasts. Sodium selenite was treated various
  concentration (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, and 3.2 μM) in osteoblasts. A. Cell viability
  and B. Cell cytotoxicity of sodium selenite were evaluated through MTT and LDH assay,
  respectively. C. The osteogenic activity of sodium selenite was confirmed through
  ALP activity. D. Genes expression of the osteogenic markers (OSX, Runx2, Col1α,
  and OCN) in sodium selenite (3.2 μM)-treated osteoblasts. Results are represented
  as a fold increase relative to GAPDH expression. All data are shown as the mean
  ± SD. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. *; P≤0.05,
