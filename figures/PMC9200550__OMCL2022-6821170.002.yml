caption: 'Influences of patchouli alcohol (PA) on oxidative stress and Nrf2/HO-1 signaling
  pathway in D-gal-induced aging mice. (a) The mRNA expression of Kelch-like ECH-associated
  protein 1 (Keap1) and nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in knee
  joint cartilage from aging mice given PA. (b) The mRNA relative abundance of catalase
  (Cat) and superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1) in D-gal-mediated senescence mice. (c) The
  expression of Nrf2 was evaluated using immunofluorescent staining. Scale bar, 100 μm.
  (d) The activities or contents of serum oxidation activity indicators such as CAT,
  glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), and SOD were determined using commercial
  kits. (e) The activities or contents of CAT, GSH, MDA, and SOD in different organs
  (liver, kidney, spleen, and thymus) were determined by commercial kits. Mean ± SEM.
  ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. NOR group; #P < 0.05 vs. D-gal group.'
