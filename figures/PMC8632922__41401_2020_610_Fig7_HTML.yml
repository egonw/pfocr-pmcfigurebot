figure_title: Supplementation with cystine enhanced the efficacy of DTX in vivo
caption: 'a Image of the tumors in different groups. b Mean tumor volumes on different
  days. Tumor volume was calculated as (length×width2)/2 (n = 8). c Weights of the
  tumors in different groups (n = 8). d PLS-DA model of the plasma in the different
  groups (PC1: R2X (cum)=0.178, R2Y (cum) = 0.158, Q2 (cum) = 0.127; PC2: R2X (cum) = 0.278,
  R2Y (cum) = 0.331, Q2 (cum) = 0.265; all 3 PCs: R2X (cum) = 0.361, R2Y (cum) = 0.472,
  Q2 (cum) = 0.365) (n = 8). e Accumulation of DTX in A549/DTX tumors treated with
  or without cystine supplementation (n = 6). f mRNA levels of P-gp in A549/DTX tumors
  (n = 6). g Protein levels of P-gp in A549/DTX tumors (n = 6). h GSH levels in the
  plasma of A549/DTX tumor-bearing mice (n = 8). i GSH levels in A549/DTX tumors (n = 6).
  j Cystine levels in A549/DTX tumors (n = 6). k Protein levels of key enzymes in
  the GSH synthesis pathway in A549/DTX tumors. The experiments were performed three
  times with similar results. Unpaired t test with equal variance or two-way ANOVA
  followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P <
  0.001. Data represent the mean ± SEM.'
