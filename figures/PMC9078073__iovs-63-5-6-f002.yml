caption: 'Effects of LPS on lipogenesis in differentiated HMGECs. The HMGECs were
  exposed to differentiated medium for 48 hours followed by LPS for 24 hours. (A)
  Images of lipid droplets in HMGECs detected by LipidTox staining. Scale bar: 50
  µm. (B) Densitometric analysis and quantification of lipid droplets. (C) Representative
  protein bands of ADFP, ELOVL4, and SREBP-1. (D–F) Relative intensity of ADFP (D),
  ELOVL4 (E), and SREBP-1 (F). n = 3. ***Significantly different from control, P <
  0.001.'
