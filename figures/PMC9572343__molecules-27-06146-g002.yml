caption: Dox Induces Mitochondrial Apoptosis and Cell Cycle Arrest. (A) MDA-MB-231
  cells were treated with Dox concentrations (0.1–5 µM) for 24 h then apoptosis was
  detected by labelling cells with Annexin V-tagged FITC/7AAD and analyzed by flowcytometry.
  Lower right quadrant Annexin V-positive/7AAD-negative cells, denoted as early apoptotic
  cells, Annexin V-positive/7AAD-positive cells in the upper right quadrant, denoted
  as late apoptotic cells, and 7AAD-positive/Annexin V-negative cells in the upper
  left quadrant denote necrotic cells. The graph represents the % of apoptosis and
  necrosis for three independent experiments. Cells were treated with increasing concentrations
  of Dox (0.1–5 µM) for 24 h, then cell lysates were prepared, separated by SDS PAGE,
  and assessed for (B) Bcl-xl, Bax (cyto and mito), and β-Actin. (C) Caspase-8, Caspase-9,
  Caspase-3, c-Caspase-3, c-PARP, p-γ-H2AX, and β-Actin. (D) Cells were analyzed for
  cell cycle using PI-staining. The graph represents the % of cells in each cell cycle
  phase. (E) Cyclin B1 and p-Cdc2 (Tyr15) protein expressions were measured. (F) Immunofluorescent
  staining for both proteins were assessed. Each value represents the mean ± S.E.M
  of three independent experiments. * p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤ 0.001 compared
  with the correspondent control.
