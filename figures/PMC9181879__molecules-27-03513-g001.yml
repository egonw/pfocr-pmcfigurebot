caption: Molecular mechanisms of tumor drug resistance induced by EGFR, PI3K/Akt,
  Wnt/β-catenin, TGF-β, and combinations of these signaling pathway inhibitors’ derivatives
  from natural products to overcome tumor resistance. (A) EGFR signaling pathway and
  its inhibitors’ derivatives from natural products. (B) PI3K/Akt signaling pathway
  and its inhibitors derivatives from natural products. (C) Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway and its inhibitors’ derivatives from natural products. (D)TGF-β signaling
  pathway and its inhibitors’ derivatives from natural products. (E) Notch signaling
  pathway and its inhibitors’ derivatives from natural products.
