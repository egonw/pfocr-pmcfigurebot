caption: 'Bone repair effects of biological hydrogel scaffolds containing laponite
  using cranial defect rat models 8 weeks after implantation as determined by Micro-CT
  analysis and Van Gieson staining. (a) Micro-CT 3D reconstruction of new bone formation
  (yellow color indicates new bone). (b) New bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV) ratio,
  (c) Trabecular bone thickness (TbTh) and (d) the number of trabecular bone (TbN)
  of the skull defect area in each group. αp<0.05 vs Blank; βp<0.05 vs Hyd; γp<0.05
  vs Hyd_Lap. (e) Histological analysis of tissues by VG staining. NB: new bone. (For
  interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is
  referred to the Web version of this article.)'
