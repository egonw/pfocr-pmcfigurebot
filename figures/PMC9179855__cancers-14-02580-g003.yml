caption: MUC1-C induces cGAS and STING expression. (A) Candidate enrichment plot of
  BT-549 RNA-seq data for the WP CYTOSOLIC DNA SENSING PATHWAY gene signature. (B)
  Lysates from (i) BT-549/tet-MUC1shRNA cells treated with vehicle or DOX for 7 days
  (left) and (ii) BT-549/CshRNA and BT-549/MUC1shRNA#2 cells (right) were immunoblotted
  with antibodies against the indicated proteins. (C,D) Lysates from MDA-MB-436/tet-MUC1shRNA
  (C) and SUM149/tet-MUC1shRNA (D) cells treated with vehicle or DOX for 7 days were
  immunoblotted with antibodies against the indicated proteins. (E) Scatter plots
  showing correlations of MUC1 with cGAS and STING in TNBCs from the TCGA-BRCA cohort.
  (F) BT-549/tet-MUC1shRNA cells treated with vehicle or DOX for 7 days and transfected
  with poly dA:dT for 12 h (left) or stimulated with IFN-β for 24 h (right) were analyzed
  for STING mRNA levels by qRT-PCR. (G) BT-549/tet-MUC1shRNA cells treated with vehicle
  or DOX for 7 days were analyzed for IFNB1 mRNA levels by qRT-PCR. The results (meanSD
  of 4 determinations) are expressed as relative mRNA levels compared to that obtained
  for vehicle-treated cells (assigned a value of 1). (H) BT-549/tet-MUC1shRNA cells
  were treated with vehicle or DOX for 7 days and then transfected with poly I:C for
  12 h. Supernatants were analyzed for IFN-β levels by ELISA. The results (mean ±
  SD of 3 determinations) are expressed as IFN-β pg/mL. The asterisk (*) denotes a
  p-value < 0.05. Uncropped Western Blots can be found at .
