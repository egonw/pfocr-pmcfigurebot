figure_title: Ruxolitinib enhances hematopoietic regeneration by promoting mitochondria
  transfer from BMSCs to donor-derived HSPCs
caption: (A) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the JAK/STAT pathway and critical
  mitochondria transfer–related pathway in vehicle- or ruxolitinib-treated aGVHD BMSCs.
  (B) Mitochondria transfer from recipient BMSCs to donor BM cells (represented by
  the percentage of transplanted BM cells containing host BMSC–derived Dendra2+ mitochondria
  [mito-containing]); n = 3–4 per group. (C) Schematic illustration and percentage
  of mitochondria transfer from BMSCs to HSPCs after in vitro coculturing; n = 6 per
  group. (D) Relative MitoSox levels in donor-derived HSPCs after transplantation
  into vehicle- or ruxolitinib-treated aGVHD recipients; n = 3 per group. (E) Strategy
  for in vitro coculture and relative MitoSox levels in HSPC after coculture with
  BMSC derived from vehicle- or ruxolitinib-treated aGVHD mice; n = 3 per group. *P
  < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001, by 1-way ANOVA followed by unpaired, 2-tailed
  t test (B) and unpaired, 2-tailed t test (C–E).
