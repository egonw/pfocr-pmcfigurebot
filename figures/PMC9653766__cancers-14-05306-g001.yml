caption: 'Diagram of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway showing the molecules considered
  in this study. The diagram is derived from the “RAS pathway v2.0” diagram curated
  by the RAS Initiative of the US National Cancer Institute, originally published
  by the National Cancer Institute (https://www.cancer.gov/sites/g/files/xnrzdm211/files/styles/cgov_enlarged/public/cgov_image/media_image/800/100/files/ras-pathway-enlarge.jpeg?h=4233ef75&itok=aJpyY4D-
  (accessed on 20 September 2022)). Solid lines with arrows represent activating signals.
  Dashed lines represent inhibitory signals. In bold are the pivotal molecules of
  the pathway: the RAS isoforms and the molecules of the ERK cascade. Shown in black
  but not bold are the other molecules of the extended pathway that are considered
  in the present study (direct activators or inhibitors of RAS and molecules involved
  in the feedback mechanisms of the pathway). In gray and in parentheses are some
  other important molecules not considered in the present study. Names separated by
  periods represent proteins that are believed to form physical complexes. The bracket
  connecting KSR1/2 to the RAF, MAP2K, and MAPK genes indicates a scaffolding function.'
