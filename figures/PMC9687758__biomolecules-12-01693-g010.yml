caption: Annotation of genes in the KEGG generated hsa04390 pathway; the Hippo signaling
  pathway. Differentially expressed genes in the hsa04390 pathway have been annotated
  using R package Pathview. Gene expression has been normalised to a range of [−1,
  1] to enhance visibility in which orange corresponds to upregulation while cyan
  corresponds to downregulation. Grey coloured genes are expressed but not differentially
  so. White coloured genes were not found to be expressed in our dataset.
