caption: 'PAS-Na treatment reduced the activation of ASK1 and p38 induced by Pb in
  hippocampal neurons. a Primary hippocampal neurons were treated with 50 μM PbAc
  for 24 h, followed by 100, 200 or 400 μM PAS-Na treatment for 24 h. The activations
  of ASK1 and p38 were determined by western blotting. b Rats were treated with 10
  mg/kg PbAc for 4 weeks during the juvenile period, followed by 80, 160 or 240 mg/kg
  PAS-Na treatment for 2 weeks. c Rats were treated with 2 mg/kg PbAc for 12 weeks,
  followed by 80, 160 or 240 mg/kg PAS-Na treatment for 6 weeks. The activations of
  ASK1, JNK and p38 were determined by western blotting. The phosphorylated protein
  expression was normalized by total protein content. * P < 0.05 and * * P < 0.01,
  compared to the control group. #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01, compared to the Pb-treated
  group.'
