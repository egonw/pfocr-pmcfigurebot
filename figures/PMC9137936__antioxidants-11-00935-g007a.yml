caption: Changes of the expression levels of autophagy (A) and apoptosis (B)-related
  genes in the liver of gibel carp in the normal group and hypoxia group after 56
  days of feeding with VC. The * or ** at the top of the bar chart indicates significant
  difference between treatments; * indicates a significant difference (p < 0.05),
  and ** indicates an extremely significant difference (p < 0.01). All of the data
  are presented as the mean Â± standard error (n = 6).
