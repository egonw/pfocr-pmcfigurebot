caption: 'The functional enrichment and expression profile of DEGs in the thoracic
  aorta. (a) The KEGG PATHWAY functional enrichment of down-regulated DEGs between
  the disease group and the control group. (b) The bar chart shows all significant
  DEGs in each comparison group, including up-regulated or down-regulated genes. (c)
  The KEGG PATHWAY functional enrichment of up-regulated DEGs between the LN + SR31-3
  group and the LN group. (d) Heatmap showing the differentially expressed lncRNAs
  between different groups. (e) KEGG PATHWAY functional enrichment of up-regulated
  DEGs between the LN + SR61-2 group and the LN group. cont W: animals not treated
  with L-NAME receiving standard chow; cont LN: L-NAME-treated rats receiving standard
  chow; LN + SR37-3: L-NAME treated rats receiving PFM-SR37-3; LN + SR61-2: L-NAME-treated
