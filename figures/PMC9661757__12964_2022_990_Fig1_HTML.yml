caption: JAK1 is frequently mutated and downregulated in EC. A Schematics of the JAK1
  proteins show the positions of individual somatic mutations identified in the endometrial
  cancer TCGA cohort. B JAK1 mutations were more frequently detected in the microsatellite
  instability (MSI) subgroup and POLE-mutated subgroup. C The relative mRNA expression
  of JAK1 in normal endometrial tissues and endometrial cancer tissues from TCGA cohort.
  D Representative images of JAK1 IHC in normal and EC specimens. Original magnification
  200×, scale bar, 100 μm (left); 400×, scale bar, 50 μm (right). E Immunohistochemistry
  scores (IS) of JAK1 in normal endometrium (n = 20) and EC tissues (n = 45)
article_title: JAK1 inactivation promotes proliferation and migration of endometrial
  cancer cells via upregulating the hypoxia-inducible factor signaling pathway.
