caption: TRAF7 associates with TBK1. A TRAF7 associated with TBK1 in a yeast two-hybrid
  system. DNA binding domain fused with TRAF7 (Full length, 1–390, or 407–670) and
  activation domain fused to TBK1 were co-expressed in AH109 yeast, and DNA binding
  domain fused with TBK1 and activation domain fused to TRAF7 (Full length, 1–390,
  or 407–670) were co-expressed in AH109 yeast. B TRAF7 associates with TBK1. HEK
  293 ​cells (∼2 ​× ​105) were transfected with the indicated plasmids. Cells were
  treated or untreated with SeV (MOI ​= ​1) for 10 ​h before Co-IP and immunoblot
  analysis. C Endogenous TRAF7 is associated with TBK1. HEK 293 ​cells (4 ​× ​106)
  were infected with SeV (MOI ​= ​1) for indicated times or left untreated before
  endogenous co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. D TRAF7 is colocalized
  with TBK1. MCF7 cells were incubated with anti-HA (green) and anti-Flag (red) antibodies.
  Nuclei were incubated with DAPI (10 ​μg/mL). Images were acquired with a Leica DMI8
  (The size bar represents 50 ​μm).
