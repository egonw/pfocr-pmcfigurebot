caption: SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers distinct characteristics of proteomics and
  metabolomics among adult, elder, and vaccinated COVID-19 NHP models. a Bar and dot
  plots of the KEGG pathway combined functional analysis of the enriched pathways
  associated with differentially expressed proteins and metabolites between the control
  and adult prototypic SARS-CoV-2 strain-infected model groups. b, c Heatmap revealing
  that genes corresponding to differential proteins and metabolites are mainly enriched
  in the insulin resistance pathway and lipid and atherosclerosis pathway. d Bar plots
  of the KEGG pathway combined functional analysis of the enriched pathways associated
  with differentially expressed proteins and metabolites from 3 days post-infection
  (DPI) to 7 DPI from the elder prototypic SARS-CoV-2 strain-infected COVID-19 model
  compared with those of the control group. In a and d, the blue characters represent
  the signaling pathway directly related to glycometabolism involved in the islets,
  the red characters represent the metabolic pathway directly related to COVID-19,
  and the green characters represent the metabolic pathway related to blood circulation.
  e Correlation networks of significant protein interaction. Each node in the interaction
  network represents a protein, and the change in node color from red to blue represents
  the change in protein expression level from being upregulated to being downregulated.
  The thickness of the lines represents the change from high to low confidence in
  interaction relationships. f Volcano plot showing the relative content differences
  of proteins between the control and the prototypic SARS-CoV-2 strain-infected model
  vaccinated with inactivated vaccines and the significance of statistical differences.
  Each dot in the volcano plot represents a protein, with green dots representing
  downregulated differential proteins, red dots representing upregulated differential
  proteins, and gray dots representing proteins detected but not significantly different.
  g, h Volcano plot showing the relative content differences of lipids and metabolites
  between the control and vaccinated COVID-19 model groups and the significance of
  statistical differences, respectively. Each dot in the volcano plot represents a
  lipid or a metabolite, with green dots representing downregulated differential lipids
  or metabolites, red dots representing upregulated differential lipids or metabolites,
  and gray dots representing lipids or metabolites detected but not significantly
  different. i Dynamic distribution of metabolites. The abscissa represents the cumulative
  number of substances in the order of difference multiple from small to large, and
  the ordinate represents the pair value with the difference multiple as base 2. Each
  dot represents a substance, the green dot represents the substance that is in the
  top 10 ranking down, and the red dot represents the substance that is in the top
  10 ranking up. The KEGG pathway name with blue characters represents significantly
  enriched pathways related to diabetes mellitus and glucose metabolism impairment.
  The KEGG pathway name with red characters represents a SARS-CoV-2-associated pathway.
  The KEGG pathway name with green characters represents significantly enriched pathways
  related to thrombogenesis
