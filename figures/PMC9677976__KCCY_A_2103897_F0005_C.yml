caption: Decreased MMP2 inhibits HTR-8/SVneo cell migration and invasion, similar
  to the response with the overexpression of miR-4443. (a), (b) The MMP2 mRNA and
  protein levels after transfecting with MMP2 siRNA. (c) Changes of migration and
  invasion of HTR-8/SVneo cell transfected with MMP2 siRNA. (d) The results were statistically
  based on the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. (e), (f) The MMP2 mRNA
  and protein levels after transfecting with overexpression MMP2 plasmid. (g) Changes
  of migration and invasion of HTR-8/SVneo cell transfected with overexpression MMP2
  plasmid. (h) The results were statistically based on the mean ± SD of three independent
  experiments. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001.
