caption: 'Effect of Sesn2 on M1 macrophage-related oxidative stress in vitro. A, Nrf2
  levels in each group were measured by western blotting. B, ROS levels were examined
  using DCFH-DA. C, SOD activity, MDA levels, and GSH levels were analyzed. N = 6
  in each group. *P < 0.05 versus the ox-LDL + siRNA or cDNA-Sesn2 group. #P < 0.05
  versus the ox-LDL + si-Sesn2 or cDNA-Sesn2 group.'
