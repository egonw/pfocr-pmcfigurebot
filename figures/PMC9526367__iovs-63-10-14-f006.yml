caption: 'The change of Notch signaling pathway in TGFβ1-treated ARPE-19 cells with
  or without RO treatment. (A) Western blot analysis of Notch ligands (Jag1 and DLL4)
  in TGFβ1-treated ARPE-19 cells from 1 to 24 hours (n = 4 biological replicates).
  (B) Western blot for γ-secretase proteinases including nicastrin, presenilin 1 and
  2, and PEN2 in TGFβ1-treated ARPE-19 cells (n = 4 biological replicates). (C) The
  change of NICD and Notch downstream effector Hes1 among different groups (n = 4
  biological replicates). (D) The change of protein levels of Notch related molecules
  in TGFβ1-treated ARPE-19 cells with or without RO treatment (40 µM) for 12 hours
  (n = 3 biological replicates). Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. * P < 0.05, **
  P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001, **** P < 0.0001; 1-way ANOVA with Tukey''s multiple comparisons
