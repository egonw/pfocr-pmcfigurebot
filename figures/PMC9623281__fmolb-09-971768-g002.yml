caption: The construction of the potential drug combinations. Taking the key genes
  of diseases as an example, the key pathways are the same. (A) Genes above the upper
  limit are key genes. (B) Eliminate drugs that do not have intersections with key
  disease genes. (C) A drug combination is constructed, and if the drugs in the combination
  have the same target, the combination is eliminated.
