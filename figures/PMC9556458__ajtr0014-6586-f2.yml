caption: ALDOA expression in different subgroup of human GC tumor tissues. (A) IHC
  scores of ALDOA in GC tumors with tumor size < 5 cm or ≥ 5 cm. (B) IHC scores of
  ALDOA in GC tumors with depth of invasion T1-2 or T3-4. (C) IHC scores of ALDOA
  in GC tumors with or without LNM. (D) IHC scores of ALDOA in GC tumors with TNM
  stage I-II or stage III-IV. (E) IHC scores of ALDOA in GC tumors with age < 65 or
  ≥ 65 years. (F) IHC scores of ALDOA in GC tumors of male or female. (G) IHC scores
  of ALDOA in GC tumors of different locations. Or (H) ALDOA mRNA expression in different
  TNM stages in the TCGA datasheet from the GEPIA. NS, nonsignificant; **P < 0.01;
  ***P < 0.001.
