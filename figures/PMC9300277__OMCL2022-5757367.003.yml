caption: 'AS-IV treatment enhances the contractile force of detrusor in pBOO rats.
  (a–d) Contractile responses of bladder muscle strips from rats subjected to sham
  (violet), pBOO (red) followed by either control or low-dose AS-IV (greed)/high-dose
  AS-IV (blue) were determined by isometric tension testing in response to electrical
  field stimulation (a), carbachol (b), α, β-methyl-adenosine triphosphate (α, β-me
  ATP) (c), and potassium chloride (KCl) (d). (e) Protein level of mAChR M2 and M3
  in bladder lysis. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, pBOO vs. sham; #P < 0.05,
  ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001, AS-IV-treated groups vs. pBOO. Error bars show ±SEM.'
