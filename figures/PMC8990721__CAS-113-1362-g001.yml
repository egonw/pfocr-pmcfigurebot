caption: von Willebrand factor (vWF) was expressed de novo in lung adenocarcinoma.
  A, Western blot analysis of vWF and GPIbα expression in lung adenocarcinoma cell
  lines and HUVECs. B, The FACS analysis of vWF expression (red) in indicated cancer
  cell lines. FITC‐labeled normal mouse IgG was used as control. C, ELISA analysis
  of vWF expression in supernatant of lung adenocarcinoma cells and HUVECs after 24
  h and 48 h of cultivation. D, RT‐PCR analysis of endothelial cell–specific genes
  in mRNA level (CD31, Tie2, VEGFR, CD144, and eNOS). E, Western blot analysis of
  endothelial cell–specific genes in protein level (CD31, CD34, and VEGFR1/2). F,
  Confocal microscopy and immunofluorescence staining to detect vWF expression (green)
  pathway positioning in 95D and A549 cell lines and HUVECs. DAPI (blue) marked the
  nucleus, and different organelles were marked with specific marker antibodies (lysosome;
  60× magnification). G, Western blot analysis of vWF expression in lung adenocarcinoma
  cell lines and HUVECs. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001
