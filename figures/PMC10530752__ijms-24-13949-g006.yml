caption: Effects of piperine-induced apoptosis through the PI3K signaling pathway
  in oral cancer tumor. Expression levels of (A,B) Bax, Bcl-2, (C,D) p-PI3K, p-Akt,
  and p-mTOR proteins in oral cancer tumors after piperine (0, 50 mg/kg daily for
  4 weeks) treatment. Î²-actin was used as loading control, and the quantification
  was performed using ImageJ. Data are presented as mean and SD for three samples.
  * p < 0.05, compared with the control group.
