figure_title: Changes in TNBC malignancy induced by PDZK1 overexpression or inhibition
  are reversed by restoration of EGFR expression or pretreatment with an EGFR kinase
  inhibitor
caption: Restoration of EGFR expression reversed the PDZK1-mediated inhibition of
  EGFR signalling (A, B) and malignancy (C, H) of TNBC. Inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation
  by AG1478 pretreatment reversed the promotion of PDZK1 knockdown on EGFR signalling
  (I–J) and malignancy (K–P) of TNBC. WB data are the representative of three independent
  experiments (A, B, I–J). Other data are shown as mean ± SD of three independent
  experiments. Data were analysed by repeated measures ANOVA (C, D, K, L) and ANOVA
  (E–H, M–P). **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. ns, not significant.
