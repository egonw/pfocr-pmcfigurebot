caption: According to our hypothesis, the deficiency of tight junction proteins and
  enhanced gut barrier permeability, which will allow for the translocation of bacteria
  and other luminal content, local activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, and
  inflammation of the intestinal wall tissue, are all key processes for the vicious
  cycle secondary to the damaged intestinal barrier. Eventually, inflammation creates
  a vicious loop by aggravating the damage to the intestinal barrier.
