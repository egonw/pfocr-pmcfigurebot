caption: LncR-133a suppresses the differentiation of goat MuSCs. (a) The expression
  levels of lncR-133a were determined in MuSCs transfected with pEGFP-N1 or pEGFP-lncR-133a.
  (b) Muscle differentiation marker genes (MyoG and MyoD) expression levels were determined
  in MuSCs transfected with pEGFP-N1 or pEGFP-lncR-133a. (c) The expression levels
  of lncR-133a were measured in MuSCs transfected with si-NC or si-lncR-133a. (d)
  The expression levels of muscle differentiation marker genes (MyoG and MyoD) were
  determined in MuSCs transfected with si-NC or si-lncR-133a. (e) MyoG and MyoD protein
  levels were determined in MuSCs transfected with pEGFP-N1 or pEGFP-lncR-133a, si-NC
  or si-lncR-133a. Image Pro Plus software (version 6.0, Media Cybernetics) was used
  to calculate the quantification of protein expression. (f) MyHC-stained cells were
  transfected with pEGFP-N1 or pEGFP-lncR-133a and then cultured in differentiation
  medium (DM) for 4 days. DAPI stainingwas used to visualize the nuclei of cells (blue).
  The length (g) and fusion index (h) of myotubes were determined. Scale bars = 100
  μm. (i) Immunofluorescence assay for MyHC-stained cells transfected with si-NC or
  si-lncR-133a then cultured in DM for 4 days. Cell nuclei were visualized with DAPI
  (blue). Quantified myotube length (j) and fusion index (k) Scale bars = 100 μm.
  Data are means ± standard error of the mean of at least three biological replicates,
  * p < 0.05.
