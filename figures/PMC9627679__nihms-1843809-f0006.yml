caption: CTLA-4 pathway defects. Activation of T cells requires (1) binding of the
  T-cell receptor (TCR) to an antigen-loaded major histocompatability complex (MHC),
  and (2) binding of the costimulatory protein CD28 to CD80/86. CTLA-4 is an analog
  of CD28 that also binds CD80/86 but serves to inhibit T-cell activation. When CTLA-4
  signaling is impaired, either by underproduction of CTLA-4 (CTLA-4 haploinsufficiency)
  or by enhanced CTLA-4 degradation/reduced recycling (LRBA deficiency), there is
  immune dysregulation from reduced peripheral tolerance. Treatment with CTLA-4-Ig
  (e.g., abatacept) can supply this missing signal. Image created on BioRender.com.
