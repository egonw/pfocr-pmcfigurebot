  in Mrps5 mutant hearts
caption: a Volcano plot of the dysregulated genes in Mrps5cKO/AAV-Klf15 by comparison
  with Mrps5cKO/AAV-Luci hearts. b Hierarchical clustering heatmap of dysregulated
  genes in Mrps5cKO/AAV-Luci and Mrps5cKO/AAV-Klf15 hearts. c Kyoto Encyclopedia of
  Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional enrichment analysis of the downregulated genes
  in Mrps5cKO/AAV-Klf15 hearts. d KEGG functional enrichment analysis of the upregulated
  genes in Mrps5cKO/AAV-Klf15 hearts. e Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of the glucose
  metabolic biological processes affected in Mrps5cKO/AAV-Klf15 hearts. f Heatmaps
  of the relative expression of the differentially expressed genes in dysregulated
  pathways identified in Mrps5cKO/AAV-Luci and Mrps5cKO/AAV-Klf15 hearts. g Gene set
  enrichment analysis (GSEA) showing dysregulated signaling pathways in Mrps5cKO/AAV-Klf15
  hearts. h qRT-PCR analysis of the mRNA expression level of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis,
  OXPHOS, and BCAAs catabolic associated genes in Mrps5cKO/AAV-Luci (n = 5) and Mrps5cKO/AAV-Klf15
  hearts (n = 5). i Scatter diagram of dysregulated genes in Mrps5cKO versus Mrps5fl/fl
  hearts and Mrps5cKO/AAV-Klf15 versus Mrps5cKO/AAV-Luci hearts. The gene expression
  level of Aldob is reduced in Mrps5cKO but enhanced in Mrps5cKO/AAV-Klf15 hearts.
  j Diagram illustrating the position and role of Aldob in the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis
  pathway. All data were presented as mean ± SEM. P values were determined by a two-tailed
  unpaired Students’ t-test in (a, c, d, e, h, i).
