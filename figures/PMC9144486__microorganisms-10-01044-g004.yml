caption: 'Pathway analysis based on identified clusters. Linear discriminant analysis
  effect size (LEfSe) analysis identified the assumed activated Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathways that characterized each cluster:
  (a) linear discriminant analysis (LDA) scores for identified metabolic pathways
  of the Prevotella-rich cluster (20 pathways), the Faecalibacterium-rich cluster
  (11 pathways), and the Bifidobacterium-rich cluster (16 pathways). Purple indicates
  Prevotella-rich cluster, blue indicates “Other” cluster, green indicates Faecalibacterium-rich
  cluster, and red indicates Bifidobacterium-rich cluster; (b) cladogram of LEfSe
  analysis results. This is a circular tree diagram representing the hierarchical
  categories of KEGG metabolic pathways, with each yellow dot representing a pathway
  identified in this analysis. The regions that characterize each cluster are shaded
  with the color of the cluster.'
