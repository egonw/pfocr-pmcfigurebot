  GO enrichment analysis of up- and downregulated genes under low-Pi conditions. b
  KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of up- and downregulated genes under low-Pi conditions.
  c KOG enrichment analysis of TDGs (Total TDG), upregulated DEGs (Up_DEG), and upregulated
  TDGs (Up_TDG). KOG items that are significantly enriched in all three categories
  are shown.
