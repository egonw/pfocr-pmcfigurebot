figure_title: In DR, increased levels of LPS activates the inflammasome in typical
  and atypical forms
caption: The atypical inflammasome pathway activates caspase-11, which directly causes
  pyroptosis. In a specific model, NLRP3 causes procaspase-1 to be cleaved into active
  caspase-1, and activated caspase-1 cleaves IL-18 and IL-1Î², resulting in cell pyroptosis.
  Simultaneously, P2X7 activation, cell death and the release of many inflammatory
  factors significantly increase the secretion of ATP, forming an inflammatory cascade,
  and finally, the formation of P2X7 macropores, leading to cell death.
