caption: 'Baseline WES identified mutations in 33/48 (69%), with a median of 5 genes
  affected per sample (range: 0-8). In patients treated with zanubrutinib (screen
  failure n=1), NFkB and NOTCH pathway genes were implicated in 13 (73%) and 10 (56%)
  patients respectively. KMT2D was most affected (n=7) followed by NOTCH1, NOTCH2,
  TNFAIP3 and MYD88 (all n=4). Patients with either MYD88 or TNFAIP3 mutations had
  improved median PFS (not reached (NR) vs 11.1 months, p: 0.009, HR: 0.09, 95% CI:
  0.02-0.55); patients with KMT2D showed a trend to worse outcomes (PFS: 13.40 months
  vs NR, p: 0.06, HR 6.5, 95%CI: 1.06-38.76) [Figure a-c]. NOTCH mutations did not
  associate with outcome. CARD11 mutations were not detected. PLCy2 (H244R, L704V)
  mutations were detected in 2 patients prior to BTKi commencement but neither was
  associated with primary resistance.'
