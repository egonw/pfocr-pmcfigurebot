caption: 'NOB modulated placental P53 pathway and mitochondrial apoptosis pathway
  in RUPP rats. (A) The mRNA expressions of P53, Mdm2, P21, Bcl2, and Bax were estimated
  using an RT-qPCR. The mRNA ratio of Bcl2/Bax was calculated. ACTB was used as an
  internal control. (B) The protein expressions of P53, P21, and BCL2 were detected
  using the rat P53 ELISA kit, rat P21 ELISA kit, and rat BCL2 ELISA kit, respectively.
  The MDM2 and BAX protein levels were estimated using a Western blot. ACTB was used
  as an internal control, and the relative protein expression was the ratio of the
  target protein to ACTB. Data are expressed as the mean ± standard error (Mean ±
  SEM). a: comparing with the control groups, p < 0.05; b: comparing with the NOB
  groups, p < 0.05; c: comparing with the hypoxia groups, p < 0.05.'
