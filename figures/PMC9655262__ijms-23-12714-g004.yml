caption: Potential role of necroptosis in human pathological diseases. The necroptosis
  pathway and its regulatory proteins (RIPK1/-3/MLKL) have been involved in numerous
  clinical diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular, lung, renal, hepatic, neurodegenerative,
  and inflammatory diseases. RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL-dependent necroptotic cell death
  have been observed in diseases such as acute kidney and liver injury, autoimmune
  disease, and cancer. In chronic kidney and lung injury and cardiovascular diseases,
  RIPK3/MLKL-dependent, but RIPK1-independent, phenotypes have been observed. Furthermore,
  RIPK1-mediated necroinflammation, independent of necroptosis, has been implicated
  in neurodegenerative, kidney, renal, sepsis, and autoimmune diseases.
