caption: UBE2S promotes cell proliferation and migration in HCC. (a) UBE2S protein
  levels in different HCC cell lines were determined by western blot. Western blotting
  (b) and qRT-PCR (c) analysis of UBE2S in MCHH-97H cells transfected with siRNA.
  (d) Effects of UBE2S on cell proliferation were determined by CCK-8. (e) Cells with
  or without UBE2S were cultured for 5 days. Colonies were counted and indicated.
  (f) Transwell assays were performed to evaluate the effect of UBE2S on the cell
  migration. ∗p < 0.05,  ∗∗p < 0.01,  ∗∗∗p < 0.001, and∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.
