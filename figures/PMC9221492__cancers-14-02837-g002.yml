caption: Synthetic lethality as a therapeutic strategy in cancers driven by oncogenes.
  Synthetic lethality happens when the alteration of an oncogene or gene X in isolation
  is compatible with cellular viability, whereas loss of both genes together leads
  to cellular lethality. Cancer-driving genetic alterations are commonly associated
  with dependencies that are specific to these alterations and absent in normal non-neoplastic
  cells. The presence of one of these dependencies in cancer cells but not in normal
  cells can therefore create opportunities to selectively kill cancer cells by mimicking
  the effect of the second genetic mutation with targeted therapy. Figure made in
