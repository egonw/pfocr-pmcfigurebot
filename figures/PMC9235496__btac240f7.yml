caption: GO and KEGG pathway networks of (A) TSLP and (B) IFNG. (A) TSLP was predicted
  as the inhibitory target, and (B) IFNG was predicted as the activatory target. These
  analyses were performed based on the genes differentially expressed following TSLP
  knockdown and IFNG overexpression, respectively. The top panels show the GO analysis
  results for biological process terms. The bottom panels show the results of KEGG
  pathway analysis. The circles in the GO and KEGG pathway analysis represent GO terms
  and KEGG pathways, respectively. The edges denote termâ€“term interactions and functional
  groups (GO groups) based on genes shared between the terms. The node colors represent
  GO groups. The node size represents the term significance; the biggest term of a
  group is the most significant, and it is highlighted on the network. These GO terms
  and pathways in the networks are shown in
