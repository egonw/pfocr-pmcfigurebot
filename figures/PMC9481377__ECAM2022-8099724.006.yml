caption: 'Effect of morroniside on the protein expression of MAPK signaling pathway.
  (a) The protein expression levels of p-p38, p38, p-JNK, JNK, p-ERK, and ERK were
  detected by western blot analysis. (b-d) Densitometric analyses for western blots
  in (a). Data represent mean ± SD, n = 3. #P < 0.05 versus the control group, ∗P
  < 0.05 versus the H2O2 group.'
