caption: 'Effect of chrysin on 3D cell growth and vascular mimicry tube formation.
  (A) Chrysin chemical structure. (B) PC-3 cells (1 × 104 cells/well) were seeded
  on a 96-well plate coated with Matrigel and treated with chrysin for 48 h. Spheroid
  formation was photographed at a 20× field using a microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).
  The bar graph indicates tumor size (in μm) (n = 3); * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 when
  compared to the complete medium control group. (C) 3D Matrigel embedding culture
  (i.e., long-term growth). Cells were seeded into an eight-well chamber glass containing
  the reduced growth factor Matrigel. Cells were maintained for 4 d until spheroid
  formation, after which PC-3 spheroids were treated with chrysin for 48 h; spheroids
  were photographed at 40× field by microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The bar graph
  indicates tumor size (in μm) (n = 3) and * p < 0.05 when compared to the untreated
  control group. (D) VM tube formation: PC-3 (3 × 105) cells were seeded on coated
  wells in 10% FBS media or serum-free medium (Free M) and incubated at 37 °C under
  hypoxic or normoxic conditions for 11 h. The formed tubular network indicates a
  yellow arrow. Bar graph indicates percentage of VM tube formation (%). * p < 0.05
  and ** p < 0.01 compared to normoxia control group. # p < 0.05 compared to hypoxia
  control. (E) Representative Western blot images and relative densitometric bar graphs
  of HIF-1α, VE-cadherin, and PCNA. The PC-3 cells were treated with chrysin or without
  for 24 h under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Cell lysates were used for Western
  blotting to determine the expression of HIF-1α, VE-cadherin, PCNA, and β-actin.
  Data presented as the control’s fold change; * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 when compared
  to the hypoxia control, while # p < 0.05 and ## p < 0.01 are values when compared
  to the normoxia control.'
