caption: Summarized mechanism of action of tanshinone IIA in the prevention of endothelial
  dysfunction. Arrows (→) indicate the route of signaling involved in endothelial
  dysfunction. Factors suppressed by TanIIA are linked with (─┤). Endothelial dysfunction
  is a combination of oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis of vascular endothelium.
  Aside from the antioxidative activity, TanIIA inhibits inflammatory signaling like
  the TLR4-NF-κB axis and the MAPK pathway. TanIIA also blocks profibrotic components
  like TGF-βR1 and AT1R and the Wnt, Notch, and ET-1 signaling pathways.
