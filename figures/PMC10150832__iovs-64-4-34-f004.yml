caption: ERS is triggered during the rapid development of congenital cataracts induced
  by the βB2-W151C mutant. (A) Heatmap showing that ERS-related genes were dramatically
  upregulated in the lenses of W151C +/+ mutant mice at 3 months of age. (B) Real-time
  PCR analysis was used to validate the transcript levels of ERS-related genes in
  the lenses of W151C +/−, W151C +/+ and WT mice. *, P < 0.05 versus WT control mice.
  The experiments were repeated independently three or more times. (C) The ERS-related
  signaling factors p-Perk, Perk, p-Eif2α, Eif2α, Atf4, and Ire-1 were detected by
  Western blot analysis. The experiments were repeated independently three or more
  times.
