caption: Annotation of GO and KEGG analysis in chosen modules. (A) MEblue module GO
  enrichment analysis; the length of the bar shows the number of genes, and the color
  of the bar changes according to the P value. The top ten enriched GO annotations
  for cellular component, molecular function, and biological process. (B) KEGG pathway
  enrichment analysis of the MEblue module; the first 30 significantly enriched the
  KEGG pathways. The ordinate in the figure is the name of the differential gene pathway,
  and the abscissa is the enrichment factor. The color changes from green to red,
  indicating that the P value is smaller, that is, the significance of the differential
  gene pathway is higher. The size of the bubble represents the number of differential
  genes in the pathway. GO, Gene Ontology; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.
