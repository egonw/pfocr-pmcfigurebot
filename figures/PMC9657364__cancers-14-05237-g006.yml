caption: 'Blocking the NF-κB pathway reverses LINC01537-induced GC progression in
  vitro. Western blot (A) analysis of the protein levels of NF-κB in NC or OE (LINC01537-overexpression
  BGC-823 administrated with NF-κB inhibitor or not) (source data can be found at
  ). CCK8 assays (B) and colony assays (C,D) were used to detect whether administration
  of NF-κB inhibitor could inhibit the increased proliferation and tumorigenesis ability
  induced by LINC01537 overexpression. Wound healing assay (E–H) and Transwell assays
  (migration ability shown in (I,J), invasion ability shown in (K,L)) were used to
  detect whether administration of NF-κB inhibitor could inhibit the increased migration
  and invasion ability induced by LINC01537 overexpression. E,G were taken under 10X
  objective lens. I,K were taken under 20X objective lens. NC: negative control; NC:
  negative control + NF-κB inhibitor; OE: overexpression of LINC01537; OE + inhibitor:
  overexpression of LINC01537 + NF- κB inhibitor. One-way ANOVA was employed to analyze
  the statistical differences. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001.'
