caption: Features of T‐cell subsets during pregnancy. (A) GO term enrichment of genes
  which highly expressed in different trimester compared to non‐pregnancy in T cell
  (CD8+ naïve T, CD8+ cytotoxic T, CD4+ naïve T, CD4+ cytotoxic T, NKT, Treg, proliferative
  T, MAIT and other T). Red means upregulation compared to non‐pregnancy, blue means
  downregulation compared to non‐pregnancy. (B and C) Boxplots of the cell scores
  of two GO biological process terms (T‐cell receptor signalling pathway and T‐cell
  activation) in CD4+ T, CD8+ T, NKT and Treg cells across four conditions. Wilcoxon
  rank‐sum test was applied. (D and E) Box plots of the cell scores for CD4+ T, CD8+
  T, NKT and Treg cells of cytotoxic and exhausted associated genes across four conditions.
  Wilcoxon rank‐sum test was applied. (F and G) Box plots of the cell scores of two
  GO biological process terms (response to type I interferon and defense response
  to virus) in CD4+ T, CD8+ T, NKT and Treg cells across four conditions. Wilcoxon
  rank‐sum test was applied. (H and I) Box plots of the cell scores of two GO biological
  process terms (RNA splicing and alternative mRNA splicing via spliceosome) in CD4+
  T, CD8+ T, NKT and Treg cells across four conditions. Wilcoxon rank‐sum test was
  applied. (J) Correlation test between ISGs expression level in CD4+ T, CD8+ T, NKT
  and Treg cells with gestational weeks. Correlation analysis using the Pearson's
  product‐moment correlation. (K) Dot plot of ten genes expression pattern across
  four conditions, including CD27, TRAC, TRBC1, TRBC2, CD3D, CD3E, CD3G, CD2, LCK
  and PTPRC. (L) The difference in expression levels of above ten genes in CD4+ T,
  CD8+ T, NKT and Treg cells between three periods of pregnancy and non‐pregnant controls.
  (M) HNRNPL expression pattern across four conditions, the graph on the right shows
  the significance of three periods of pregnancy compared to non‐pregnant controls.
  Wilcoxon rank‐sum test was applied. All differences with p < 0.05 are indicated.
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001, ns = not significant
