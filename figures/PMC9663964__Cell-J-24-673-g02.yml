caption: 'The effects of miR-140-3p on proliferation and migration of ASMCs induced
  by PDGF-BB. A. miR-140-3p mimics or inhibitors were transfected into ASMCs stimulated
  by 20 ng/mL PDGF-BB, and the expression of miR-140-3p was detected by qRT-PCR. B.
  CCK-8 assay, C, D. BrdU assay, and E, F. Transwell assay were used to detect the
  proliferation and migration of ASMCs stimulated by 20 ng/mL PDGF-BB after transfection.
  Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (n=3) (scale bar: C: 250 μm, E:
  100 μm). *; P<0.05, **; P<0.01, ***; P<0.001, ASMCs; Airway smooth muscle cells,
  PDGF-BB; Platelet-derived growth factor, qRT-PCR; Quantitative real-time polymerase
  chain reaction, CCK-8; Cell counting kit 8, and BrdU; 5-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine.'
