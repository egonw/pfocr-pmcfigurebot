caption: 'Effects of TPS on the expression of melanogenesis-related proteins. HEM
  cells were stimulated with 5, 10, and 15 μg/ml TPS with or without UVA treatment
  (15 J/cm2). A – The cell lysates were then subjected to western blot analysis with
  antibodies against tyrosinase, TRP2, TRP1, and MITF. Equal protein loading was confirmed
  using the GAPDH antibody. B–E – Mean intensity of tyrosinase, TRP2, TRP1, and MITF
  are shown in the graph on the right. Error bars show means ± SEMs. *P < 0.05, **p
  < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 versus non-treated cells, #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001
  versus UVA-treated cells'
