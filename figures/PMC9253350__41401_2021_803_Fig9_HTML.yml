figure_title: Activation of VEGF-MEK1/2/ERK1/2 pathway in OGD-exposed 3D NVU was inhibited
  by SU1498 or PD98059
caption: a, c Fluorescence intensity of p-ERK1/2 was reduced by SU1498 or PD98059.
  b, d Axonal length was decreased in catalpol (50 μM)+SU1498 or catalpol (50 μM)+PD98059
  groups. e–g Promotion effects of catalpol on the production of p-VEGFR2/VEGFR2,
  MEK1/2, and p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2 were inhibited by SU1498 or PD98059. Scale bar = 50 μm.
  The data are presented as the mean ± S.D., n = 3, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
