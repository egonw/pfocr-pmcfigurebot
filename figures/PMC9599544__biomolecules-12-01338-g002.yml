caption: 'Liraglutide reduces oxidative stress by upregulating antioxidant enzymes
  through the AMPK-Sirt1 pathway. (a) Using DCFH-DA as a fluorescent indicator, quantitative
  data by flow cytometry showed that Liraglutide significantly inhibited ROS accumulation
  in RSC96 cells under glucolipotoxicity from 12 h to 24 h. (b) Representative images
  of intracellular ROS levels after DCFH-DA staining at 12 h. Scale bar: 100 μm. (c)
  The results of Western blotting revealed that Liraglutide stimulates AMPK-Sirt1
  signaling, thereby restoring the expression of antioxidant defense enzymes, including
  SOD1/2 and catalase inhibited by glucolipotoxicity. (d) Representative images of
  mitochondrial membrane potential by JC-1 staining, and cells observed with green
  and red fluorescence, are also quantified in percentages. The increase of JC-red
  shows that Liraglutide protects against glucolipotoxicity-induced mitochondrial
  dysfunction (JC-green). Scale bar: 50 μm. All values are presented as the mean ±
  SEM. Significant difference was determined using multiple comparisons of Dunnett’s
  posthoc test for * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01.'
