caption: 'Impact of inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPKs signaling pathways on the
  protective effect of FGF1 and EGF against taltobulin. The viability of MCF-7 cells
  treated with 5 nM TLT and various chemical inhibitors targeting key signaling pathways
  (20 µM LY294002 for PI3K, 20 µM UO126 for MEK1/2, and a mixture of 20 µM LY294002
  and 20 µM UO126 for both PI3K and MEK) was measured after 48 h in the presence or
  absence of 10 ng/mL FGF1 or EGF using the alamarBlue assay. Data were normalized
  to untreated cells and are presented as mean values ± standard deviation (SD) from
  three independent experiments. Statistical significance: ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001,
  no significant differences indicated as ‘ns’.'
