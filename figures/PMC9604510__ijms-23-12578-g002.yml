caption: Interaction between cancer cells and caner-associated fibroblasts (CAF) in
  thyroid cancer. The expressions of CAF markers, α-SMA and PDGFR-β, are increased
  by SRC and AKT pathway activated by IL-6, ROS, PDGF that are secreted by thyroid
  cancer cells. SRC and AKT pathway differentiates and activates CAF. IL-6 secreted
  by CAF promotes tumor cell proliferation, and Sonic-Hedgehog ligand secreted by
  CAF promotes cancer cell invasion and metastasis through EMT process. In this EMT
  process, the expression of vimentin is increased and the expression of E-cadherin
  is attenuated. Moreover, lactate and ketone produced by glycolysis in CAF are transported
  to tumor cells and used in energy production by TCA cycle. This metabolic reprogramming
  is called the reverse-Warburg effect.
