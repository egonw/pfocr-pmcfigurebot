caption: LSD1 Regulates Wnt/β-catenin via demethylation of the FOXF2 gene. A. In the
  TCGA colon cancer dataset, LGR5 is significantly higher in colon cancer tissues
  than in normal colon tissues; B. AXIN2 is significantly higher in colon cancer tissues
  than in normal colon tissues; C. β-catenin encoding gene CTNNB1 is significantly
  higher in colon cancer tissues than in normal colon tissues. D. CD44 is significantly
  higher in colon cancer tissues than in normal colon tissues; E. MYC is significantly
  higher in colon cancer tissues than normal colon tissues. F. The expression of LGR5,
  AXIN2, CD44, MYC, and CTNNB1 genes was detected by western blot in HCT116 cells
  that interfered with Ku80; G. Compared with control cells, the expression of the
  above genes was significantly down-regulated. H. The heat map shows the expression
  of each gene Happening. I. The mechanism diagram of the full text. **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.
article_title: LSD1 regulates the FOXF2-mediated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by
  interacting with Ku80 to promote colon cancer progression.
