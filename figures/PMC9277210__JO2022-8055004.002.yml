caption: Periplocin induces autophagy in both CFPAC1 and PANC-1 cells. (a) Cluster
  heat map of autophagy genes. Downregulated genes are shown in blue, and upregulated
  genes are shown in red. (b) LC3B Immunofluorescence when CFPAC1 and PANC-1 cells
  were treated with Periplocin (125 nM, 250 nM) or an equal volume of DMEM media for
  24 h. (c, d) The effects of Periplocin on the expression of p62 and LC3BII/I proteins
  in CFPAC1 and PANC-1 cells, as determined by Western blotting analysis. (e) Statistical
  analysis of the mean fluorescence intensity of the LC3 protein. (f) Western blot
  quantitative statistical analysis of the LC3B and P62 proteins. The data represent
  the mean ± SE, with ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001 compared between two
  groups (n = 3).
