caption: 'Cellular trafficking of sortilin. A: 1) Sortilin is converted from its proform
  to its mature form in the TGN by furin cleavage of its propeptide. Mature sortilin
  can exit the TGN through three different routes, depending on the cell type, 2)
  through anterograde sorting to endosomes, which requires binding of APs GGA and/or
  AP-1 to its cytoplasmic tail, 3) through the constitutive secretory pathway, or
  4) through the regulated secretory pathway in specialized cell types. Sortilin does
  not localize to mature secretory granules, and it is unclear how it exits immature
  secretory granules, indicated by dotted arrows. When sortilin reaches the cell surface,
  it can be 5) shed from the surface, or 6) endocytosed, which requires AP-2 binding.
  The majority of sortilin at the plasma membrane is rapidly endocytosed. 7) Sortilin
  is returned from endosomes to the TGN by retrograde sorting, which requires interaction
  with the retromer complex and PACS-1. 8) Sortilin is also involved in sorting cargo
  to multivesicular bodies and can itself be secreted from the cell in exosomes. Highlighted
  box indicates a process that occur in specialized cell types. Diagram adapted from
  Malik and Willnow et al. (). B: Important sorting motifs located in the cytoplasmic
  tails of sortilin, CI-MPR, CD-MPR, and yeast VPS10 include a tyrosine-based motif
  (YXXΦ) and an acidic cluster dileucine motif (DXXLL) that overlaps with an acidic
  cluster motif ([DE]XXXL[LI]), which are important for AP binding. Thickness of the
  underline indicates relative potency of the motif for the transport and AP binding
  indicated. MVB, multivesicular body; PACS-1, phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting
