caption: The expression of YAP signaling in diabetic HAECs and FVMs. (A) Normalized
  enrichment scores (NES) of the YAP-related pathway gene sets (|NES| > 1, p < 0.05)
  from Molecular Signatures Database (MsigDB) significantly enriched in HAECs of diabetic
  patients. (B) The relative expression levels of YAP target genes (CTGF and CYR61)
  in diabetic HAECs. (C) NES of the YAP-related pathway gene sets (|NES| > 1, p <
  0.05) from MsigDB significantly enriched in diabetic retinopathy FVMs. (D) The relative
  expression of YAP target genes (CTGF and CYR61) in FVMs of patients with diabetic
  retinopathy. Data are means Â± SD. * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001.
