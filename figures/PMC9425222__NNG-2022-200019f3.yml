figure_title: DNA Repair Pathway Genes Associated With Ataxia
caption: Pathogenic variants in multiple genes involved in single-strand break repair
  and double-strand break repair result in ataxia., Key proteins in the repair pathways
  are shown; those directly linked with ataxia are in bold and highlighted in green.
  TDP1 is associated with spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy-1 (SCAN1);
  XRCC1 is associated with autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia-26 (SCAR26);
  PNKP is associated with ataxia-oculomotor apraxia-4 (AOA4); APTX is associated with
  ataxia-oculomotor apraxia-1 (AOA1); PCNA is associated with ataxia-telangiectasia–like
  disorder-2 (ATLD2); RFC1 is associated with cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular
  areflexia syndrome (CANVAS); MRE11 is associated with ataxia-telangiectasia–like
  disorder-1 (ATLD1); ATM is associated with ataxia-telangiectasia. nt = nucleotide.
