caption: HOTAIR recruits PRC2 complex onto IκBα promoter to inhibit the gene expression.A,
  the indicated genes were subjected to the expression analysis by real-time PCR after
  HOTAIR knockdown or overexpression. Relative gene expression was normalized to endogenous
  β-actin. Results are shown as means ± SD. B, the indicated genes were subjected
  to the expression analysis by Western blotting after HOTAIR knockdown or overexpression.
  β-actin was used as an internal control. C, the indicated genes were subjected to
  the expression analysis by Western blotting after shHOTAIR transfection alone or
  along with shIκBα. β-actin was used as an internal control. D, RNA pulldown assay
  was performed and two core components of the PRC2 were confirmed by immunoblotting.
  β-actin was used as a loading control. E, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay was
  performed and the indicated genes were subjected to real-time PCR. F, ChIP-quantitative
  PCR analysis was performed for the detection of EZH2-binding site in IκBα promoter.
  Data are shown as means ± SD. G, ChIP-quantitative PCR analysis was performed for
  the detection of EZH2-binding site in IκBα promoter after HOTAIR knockdown or overexpression.
  Data are shown as means ± SD. H, different loci of IκBα promoter were constructed
  into pGL4.18 vector (upper panel) and subjected to luciferase reporter assays (lower
  panel). Data are shown as means ± SD. I, pGL4.18- IκBα promoter reporter plasmid
  was transfected into cells with WT HOTAIR or truncated HOTAIR respectively and luciferase
  activity was measured. EZH2, enhancer of zeste homolog 2; HOTAIR, Hox transcript
  antisense intergenic RNA; PRC2, polycomb repressive complex 2 (∗ indicates p < 0.05;
  ∗∗ indicates p < 0.01; ∗∗∗ indicates p < 0.001.).
