caption: 'Lipid storage in hepatocytes is accompanied by increased HIBCH expression
  and release of 3-HIB. Huh7 liver cells were treated with and without free FAs (1:1 M
  ratio of 50 μM PA and 50 μM OA) for 24 h before analyses. Gene expression was measured
  by RNA-sequencing. A: HIBCH expression in control and FA-treated cells, shown as
  RPKM (n = 6). B: Representative images of Oil-Red-O lipid-stained hepatocytes (left)
  and quantification of lipid accumulation (right) in Huh7 cells (n = 6). C: Relative
  FA uptake in Huh7 cells treated with or without FA for 24 h, followed by addition
  of fluorescent dodecanoic acid whose uptake was detected spectrophotometrically
  after 1 h (n = 9–12). D: Average net medium appearance per hour of 3-HIB during
  a 24 h period (n = 6). E: A linear mixed model accounting for the group structure
  was used to examine the correlation between HIBCH mRNA expression (RPKM) and extracellular
  3-HIB concentrations (GC–MS/MS analysis of cell culture medium) across the control
  and FA-treated samples. F: GSEA showing up- and down-regulated pathways by HIBCH
  expression (HIBCH correlation) in Huh7 (HALLMARK pathway analysis) (n = 6). Gene
  sets are ordered by normalized enrichment score (NES) and significant adjusted p-value
  for each pathway are shown. Ctrl, control; FA, fatty acids; GSEA, gene set enrichment
  analysis; RPKM, reads per kilobase per million mapped reads.∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗p < 0.001 (Unpaired t-test or Mann–Whitney test).'
