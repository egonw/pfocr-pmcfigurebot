caption: Autocrine role of BMP signaling pathway in vitro and in vivo. Autocrine BMP
  signaling modulates TSC maintenance in vitro in a species-specific manner, whereby
  in mouse the highest effects were observed upon noncanonical SMAD-independent signaling
  inhibition (OXO), whereas in human both the canonical (DMH1) and noncanonical (OXO)
  branches were involved. Decrease BMP signaling is necessary for TSC differentiation
  in vitro as addition of exogenous BMP4 blunted trophoblast differentiation in both
  mouse and human TSC. These data suggest that autocrine BMP signaling contributes
  to the maintenance of a trophoblast progenitor population in the postimplantation
  extraembryonic ectoderm (ExE) in vivo. Decrease BMP signaling is necessary for correct
  differentiation toward the ectoplacental cone (EPC) while paracrine BMP signaling
  into the embryo initiates gastrulation and differentiation into progenitor germ
  cells of the epiblast (Epi).
