caption: Overexpression of BRF2 abrogated MALAT1 knockdown. (a, b) The transfection
  efficiency of OE-BRF2 in Huh7 and Hep3B cells was detected by qRT-PCR. (c, d) After
  silencing MALAT1 and overexpression BRF2, cell viability of Huh7 and Hep3B cells
  was detected by CCK-8 assay on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. (e, f) Transwell assay
  was used to detect migration and invasion of HCC cells after MALAT1 down-regulation
  and overexpression of BRF2. (g) The apoptosis rate of HCC cells after MALAT1 down-regulation
  and overexpression of BRF2 was detected by flow cytometry. (h) Western blot analysis
  was performed to detect the expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins and
  LKB1/AMPK in HCC cells after MALAT1 down-regulation and overexpression of BRF2.
