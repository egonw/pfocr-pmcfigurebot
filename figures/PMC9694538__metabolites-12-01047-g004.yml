caption: 'Functional volcano plot and heatmap analysis of quantified metabolome patterns:
  (a) 0.75 µg/mL DOX; (b) 1.5 µg/mL DOX; (c) 7.5 µg/mL DOX treated in HCT116 cells.
  This is a screenshot of a heatmap based functional analysis in HCT116 cells. (d)
  The correlation matrix of the top 25 metabolites significantly altered. The correlation
  type (positive or negative) and strength (color intensity) are coded brown and blue,
  respectively, normalized between −3 and +3 according to the bar on the right.'
