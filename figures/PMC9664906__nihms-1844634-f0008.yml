caption: (A) Expression heatmap of selected markers of thermogenesis and adipogenesis.(B)
  Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) of pathways enriched in downregulated (top) and
  upregulated (bottom) genes in Myf5Cre;Fstl1fl/fl KO iBAT.(C) Enrichment plots for
  β-catenin-regulated genes from the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA).(D and E)
  Interaction of wild-type (WT) and glycosylation-mutant (MT; N142/173/178Q) FSTL1
  with WNT10B (D) or GPC3 (E) in HEK293 cells.(F and G) tSNE plots showing co-expression
  of FSTL1 with WNT2 (F) and GPC3 (G) in rabbit iBAT SVF cells.(H) iBAT SVF cells
  were differentiated in the absence or presence of XAV939. FSTL1 and UCP1 were blotted.(I
  and J) Fstl1fl/fl iBAT SVF cells were infected with a Cre adenovirus to induce Fstl1
  gene deletion. WNT10B was overexpressed via lentiviral vectors. A 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
  bromide (MTT) proliferation assay of undifferentiated cells at 72 h (I, n = 5) and
  qRT-PCR of adipogenic and thermogenic genes of differentiated cells (J, n = 6) were
  performed.(K) iBAT SVF cells were infected with lentiviral vectors expressing GFP
  or FSTL1, followed by treatment with DMSO or XAV939 during adipogenic induction.
  UCP1 protein was blotted and quantified.(L) Schematic of the FSTL1-WNT interplay
  in brown adipocyte progenitor renewal and identity maintenance.Data are presented
  as mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 by two-way ANOVA (I and K) and unpaired Student’s
  t test (J).
