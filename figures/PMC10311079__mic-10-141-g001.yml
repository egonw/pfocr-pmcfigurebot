  transcriptional coordination of nucleotide and amino acid metabolisms upon stringent
  response in E. coli'
caption: (A) Amino acid starvation in E. coli leads to the activation of RelA to produce
  (p)ppGpp, which binds to the RNA polymerase (RNAP) to downregulate stable RNA (rRNA,
  tRNA) and upregulate amino acid biosynthesis genes at the transcriptional level.
  (B) At the metabolic level, (p)ppGpp directly inhibits (in red broken lines) the
  de novo and the salvage pathways (highlighted in red shadow) of purine nucleotides
  synthesis by targeting the PurF and Gpt/Hpt/Gsk proteins, respectively (in red font).
  Meanwhile, (p)ppGpp binds to PpnN (light blue font) and stimulates its activity
  (in blue broken lines) to degrade excess nucleotides, from both the redundant nucleotides
  and the degraded rRNAs/tRNAs. Degraded nucleotides lead to increased nucleobases
  (Gua, Xan, Hyp) (in blue up arrows) and R5P. The former ones bind to PurR to repress
  expression of genes (in red dotted lines) in the de novo purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis
  pathways. R5P, used to produce pRpp, enters the pentose phosphate pathway and culminates
  with the synthesis of (aromatic) amino acids and the intermediate metabolites. Metabolites
  highlighted with light blue up arrows are the ones that increased their concentrations
  upon amino acid starvation in the wild type E. coli, but not in the Î”ppnN mutant
  strain []. The list of abbreviated metabolites is included in the inset.
