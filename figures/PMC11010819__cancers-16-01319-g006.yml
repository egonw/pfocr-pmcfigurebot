caption: 'Stimulatory effects of pomalidomide combined with targeted loss of BRD9
  on signaling pathways in MM. (A,B,D,E) Pathway analyses showing signaling pathways
  upregulated by doxycycline-induced BRD9 KD+pomalidomide treatment of H929 cells
  (clones #1 and #5) for 24 h. The full list of genes downregulated in response to
  doxycycline+pomalidomide was used for these analyses. Gene numbers are shown in
  parentheses. For (A,B), GeneCodis was utilized for pathway analysis, using GO Biological
  Process, and for (D,E), GeneCodis was utilized for pathway analysis, using Transcription
  Factors. (C) Validation (via qPCR) performed for GIMAP4, upregulated in response
  to pomalidomide+doxycycline-induced BRD9 KD in H929 cells. Treatments were as follows:
  DMSO vehicle (24 h), doxycycline (1 μg/mL), pomalidomide (50 nM), and combination
  of doxycycline (1 μg/mL)+pomalidomide (50 nM). For doxycycline-treated H929 doxycycline-inducible
  BRD9 KD#1 cells, BRD9 KD#2 cells, and BRD9 KD#5 cells, BRD9 was downregulated Log2-fold
  −1.14, Log2-fold −0.53, and Log2-fold −1.02, respectively.'
