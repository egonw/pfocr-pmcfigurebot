caption: 'Signaling pathways of neuritic self-destruction.The essential molecular
  components of a genetically encoded program of intracellular self-destruction have
  been identified. Deprivation of neurotrophic factors (i.e. NGF) activates the caspase
  cascade, which induces axonal degeneration. Additionally, the death receptor DR6-elicited
  signaling results in the activation of BAX and caspases, and mitochondrial depolarization,
  leading to local degeneration of the axon. Axonal injury also causes SARM1 activation.
  Activated SARM1 promotes NAD+ depletion. SARM1 also activates MAPK pathway. As detailed
  in the text, mechanistic links between the essential molecules of the axonal degeneration
  program are emerging. Arrows with question marks reflect postulated interactions.
  BAK: B-cell/CLL lymphoma 2 homologous antagonist/killer; DR6: death receptor 6;
  MAPK: mitogen activated protein kinase; SARM1: sterile-Î± and armadillo-motif-containing
  protein 1.'
