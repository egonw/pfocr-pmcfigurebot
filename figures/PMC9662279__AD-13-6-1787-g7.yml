caption: The roles played by SIRT6 in myocardial diseases. At c-Jun target gene promoters,
  SIRT6 interacts with c-Jun and deacetylates H3K9 to inhibit the expression of IGF
  signaling-related genes downstream of C-Jun, such as FoxO1, IGF2, IGF2R and Akt,
  attenuating cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. SIRT6 also inhibits the phosphorylation
  of Akt to suppress its activation. Phosphorylated Akt promotes p300 phosphorylation
  and subsequent expression of NF-κB target genes, such as BNP and ANF, leading to
  the development of myocardial hypertrophy. In addition, phosphorylated Akt facilitates
  phosphorylation of FoxO3 and its subsequent nuclear export to inhibit autophagic
  gene expression, including Atg8, Atg12 and Gabarapl1, promoting pathological growth
  of cardiomyocytes. EGCG has been shown to upregulate SIRT6 activity by enhancing
  NMNAT activity and subsequently increasing NAD+ levels. In addition, the novel PARP-1
  inhibitor AG-690 inhibits PARP-1 activity to maintain NAD+ intracellular levels,
  thereby upregulating SIRT6 activity. SIRT6 inhibits the expression and transcriptional
  activity STAT3 to hinder the expression of its target genes BNP and ANF. In addition,
  SIRT6 both inhibits NFATc4 expression and deacetylates NFATc4 to promote its nuclear
  export and subsequent degradation, suppressing the expression of its downstream
  genes BNP and ANF. On the promoters of mTOR signaling genes, SIRT6 interacts with
  Sp1 to repress the expression of related proteins, including mTOR, Rheb and p70S6K,
  thereby inhibiting both the synthesis of abnormal proteins and development of myocardial
  hypertrophy. In the promoter of Bcl-2, SIRT6 initially occupies this region via
  its property of high nucleosome-binding affinity and recruits TIP60. GATA4 recognizes
  the GATA sequence and subsequently interacts with SIRT6 via its C-terminal Zn-finger
  to form the SIRT6-TIP60-GATA4 complex. In this complex, SIRT6 deacetylase activity
  is repressed by GATA4, while TIP60 enhances GATA4 transcriptional activity and the
  acetylation level of local histones, ensuring the transcription of Blc-2. CircITCH
  sponges miR-330-5p to upregulate SIRT6 expression, attenuating reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) formation, DNA damage and cardiotoxicity. By deacetylating H3K9 and H3K56,
  SIRT6 inhibits the expression of TGF-β signaling-related proteins, such as SMAD3,
  TGF-β1 and TGF-β2. In addition, SIRT6 deacetylates SMAD3 at K333 and K378 to repress
  its transcriptional activity. SIRT6 deacetylates FoxO1 to promote its degradation,
  and SIRT6-mediated deacetylation of H3K9 within the PDK4 promoter also suppresses
  FoxO1 binding to this region, thereby reducing PDK4 expression and the subsequent
  accumulation of pyruvate and maintaining cardiac function. SIRT6 also inhibits myostatin
  expression to prevent the development of heart failure and its complications. After
  cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), SIRT6 upregulates AMPK activity and downregulates
  NF-κB signaling pathway activation, reducing cellular ROS levels and attenuating
  myocardial apoptosis. In addition, SIRT6 inhibits FoxO3 phosphorylation in an AMPK-dependent
  manner, and SIRT6 promotes FoxO3 nuclear translocation to induce FoxO3 target gene
  expression and reduce ROS production.
