figure_title: Didymin activates the PPAR signaling pathway. (A) SymMap analysis showed
  that didymin activated the PPAR signaling pathway. (B) Western blot was performed
  to detect the protein expression of PPAR-γ and RXRA in PC12 cells. *p<0.05 vs. 0
  µM group; †p<0.05 vs. 10 µM group; ‡p<0.05 vs. 20 µM group. (C) Western blot was
  performed to detect the protein expression of PPAR-γ and RXRA in OGD/R treated PC12
  cells. *p<0.05 vs. control group; †p<0.05 vs. OGD/R group; ‡p<0.05 vs. OGD/R+10
  µM didymin group; §p<0.05 vs. OGD/R+20 µM didymin group. PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptors; OGD/R, oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion
