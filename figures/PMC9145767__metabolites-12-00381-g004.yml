caption: Pathway analysis. A total of 72 identified metabolites were analyzed for
  pathway enrichment in MetaboAnalyst 5. The bars represent the pathway ratio, representing
  the fraction of metabolites in the BALF data set relative to that of the entire
  pathway. Significance of enrichment is indicated by color, as indicated in the scale
  on the right. (A) KEGG library. (B) SMPDB library. Note that saturated fatty acid
  synthesis and metabolism are highly enriched in both analyses.
