caption: Various stages of bio-based production process developmentThe development
  of the bio-based production process is divided into 5 stages. By establishing the
  biosynthetic pathway, improving production performance, expanding lignocellulose
  as available substrates, and enhancing the biotransformation efficiency of lignocellulose,
  an efficient production process is finally established using lignocellulosic biomass
  wastes as substrates.
