caption: 'Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis: An unexpected paradigm of sebaceous
  gland-controlled immunological reaction. Infection with human polyoma virus or Malassezia
  as well as the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome stimulate the arachidonic
  acid inflammatory pathway in the sebaceous gland. Prostglandins, downstreem arachidonic
  acid metabolites, attract eosinophils and basophils to the perisebaceous gland dermis.
  Indomethacin might exhibit its therapeutic effect by inhibiting cyclooxygenase levels
  or blocking the chemoattractant receptor homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells
  and the chemokine receptor 3. HPyV, human polyoma virus; IRIS, immune reconstitution
  inflammatory syndrome; AA, arachidonic acid; COX, cyclo-oxygenase; PG, prostaglandin;
  PGDS, PGD synthase; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; CRTH2,
  chemoattractant receptor homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells; CCR3, C-C motif
  chemokine receptor 3; CCL26, C-C motif chemokine ligand 26; Eos, eosinophil; Bas,
  basophil; ILC, innate lymphoid cell.'
