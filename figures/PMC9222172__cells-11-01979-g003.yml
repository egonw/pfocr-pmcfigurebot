caption: S100A8 and S100A9 are well known ligands of TLR4 and induce the expression
  of proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferons in monocytes and macrophages.
  Therefore, they function as amplifiers of phagocyte activation during the early
  hyper-inflammatory state of SIRS. However, long-term stimulation with S100A8/S100A9
  has a regulatory role in promoting phagocyte hypo-responsiveness to subsequent inflammatory
  stimulation. It was shown that prolonged stimulation with low doses of S100A8 and
  S100A9 leads to an activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT/GSK-3β pathway
  which interferes with the NF-κB–driven expression of proinflammatory cytokines.
  This inhibition of cytokine production is further enhanced by secondary IL-10 triggered
  activation of STAT3 and BCL-3.
