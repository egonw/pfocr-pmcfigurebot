caption: Characteristics of six cell proliferation-related pathway scores in the TCGA
  pancreatic adenocarcinoma cohort. A. Correlation matrix of six cell proliferation-related
  pathway scores. The correlation value was indicated by color (blue for positive
  correlation and red for negative correlation), while the magnitude of correlation
  was shown with circles. Spearman’s rank correlation was used to the analysis. B.
  Network plot for highly correlations of hallmark gene sets. Spearman’s rank correlation
  > 0.600 was defined as highly significantly correlated gene sets.
article_title: G2M checkpoint pathway alone is associated with drug response and survival
  among cell proliferation-related pathways in pancreatic cancer.
