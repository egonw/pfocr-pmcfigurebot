caption: 'Effect of Potentilla paradoxa Nutt. ethanol extract (Pp-EE) on NO production
  and cell viability. (A) NO production from the supernatants of RAW264.7 cells pretreated
  with various concentrations of Pp-EE (50–150 μg/mL) for 30 min and treated with
  respective inflammatory substances (lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1 μg/mL) (upper panel),
  polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly (I:C)) (200 μg/mL) (middle panel), or Pam3CysSerLys4
  (Pam3CSK4) (10 μg/mL) (lower panel)) for 24 h. The NO production level was measured
  through a Griess assay. (B) Cytotoxicity of Pp-EE in RAW264.7 cells treated for
  12 h and 24 h. The cell survival rate was measured with an MTT assay. (C,D) Treatment
  of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (0–2 mM) in RAW264.7 cells for 24
  h for efficacy comparison. Changes in NO production and effects on cell visibility
  were measured. (E) The analysis of phytochemicals in Pp-EE by GC–MS. The name and
  molecular structure of high-content phytochemicals are displayed. ###: p < 0.001
  and ##: p < 0.01 compared to the normal group, *: p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01, and ***:
  p < 0.001 compared to the control group. −: no treatment and +: treatment.'
