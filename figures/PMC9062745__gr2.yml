caption: 'SERPINA3C ablation led to exacerbated diet-induced obesity (DIO) and metabolic
  disorders in mice. The 8-week-old WT and SERPINA3C-KO mice were fed a HFD for 16
  weeks before being sacrificed for analysis. A: Body weight (BW) of these WT and
  KO mice. B: Representative pictures of the mice. C: Body composition of the mice
  measured by nuclear magnetic resonance. D: Representative images of adipose tissues
  and livers of the mice. E: Weights of adipose tissues and liver of the mice. F:
  Serum TG, TC, LDL, HDL levels of the mice after overnight fasting. G: The average
  values of the whole-body oxygen consumption rate (VO2) were measured by metabolic
  cages for the mice. H: The average values of the whole-body CO2 generation (VCO2)
  were measured by metabolic cages for the mice. I: Glucose concentrations during
  an i.p. glucose tolerance test (GTT) in mice after 10 weeks of HFD feeding. J: Area
  under the curve analysis of (I). K: Glucose concentrations during an insulin tolerance
  test (ITT) in mice after 11 weeks of HFD feeding. L: Area under the curve analysis
  of (K). M: Serum insulin level of the mice at basal condition of (K). For statistical
  analyses, two-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni’s post hoc tests were performed
  in (A), (I), and (K). Unpaired two-tailed Student’s t tests were performed in (C),
  (E), (F), (G), (H), (J), (L) and (M). For statistical analyses in (A), (C), (E)–(L),
  data were compared between the WT and KO mice. All values are represented as means
  with error bars representing S.D. ∗, p < 0.05; ∗∗, p < 0.01; ∗∗∗, p < 0.001. n =
  6 for each group.'
