caption: 'Overexpression of DNASE1L3 inhibits the proliferation of hepatocellular
  carcinoma cells. Gene enrichment analysis showed that the predefined genomes involved
  in cell cycle, cell proliferation, cell metastasis and invasion were significantly
  enriched in low‐level DNASE1L3, indicated that DNASE1L3 may has an inhibitory effect
  on above properties. (B) Western blot analysis of the expression of DNASE1L3 in
  hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells transfected with overexpression plasmid or
  siRNA. (C) Colony formation assays revealed that DNA overexpression inhibited the
  proliferation of Hep3B and HCCLM3 cells. (D) EdU assay showed that the proliferation
  of Huh7, HCCLM3 and Hep3B cells decreased after DNASE1L3 overexpression. Scale bar:
  200 μm. (E) DNASE1L3 overexpression markedly inhibited cell viability by CCK‐8 assay.
  (F) Flow cytometry showed that the overexpression of DNASE1L3 increased the G0/G1
  phase of Huh7 and HCCLM3 cells and blocked the cell cycle in G1 phase. Student''s
  t‐ test. Mean ± SD (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01). LV‐D + si‐#1/LV‐D + si‐#2: overexpression
  of DNASE1L3 by lentivirus, and then transient knockdown of DNASE1L3 using siRNA#1/siRNA#2.'
