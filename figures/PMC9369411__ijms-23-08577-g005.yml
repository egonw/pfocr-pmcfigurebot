caption: Fifteen candidate genes showing significantly modulated expression following
  low-dose radiation in both HAECs and T2D-HAECs. (A) Significant GO terms of biological
  process associated with the identified DEGs. (B) PPI network analysis identified
  the gene hub involved in the interferon signaling pathway.
