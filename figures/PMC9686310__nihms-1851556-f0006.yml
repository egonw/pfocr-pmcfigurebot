figure_title: Schematic of a muscle cell and the proteins linked to protein turnover
  and quality control
caption: b | Skeletal muscle mass is maintained by the balance of protein synthesis
  and protein degradation. b | Disruptions in chaperone surveillance, the ubiquitin
  proteasome system and the autophago-lysosomal pathway lead to pathologic changes
  in skeletal muscle that include myofibrillar disruption, inclusion bodies, protein
  aggregates and vacuolation.
