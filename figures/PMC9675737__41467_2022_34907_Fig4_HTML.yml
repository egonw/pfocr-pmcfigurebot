figure_title: NRASQ61 mutant melanoma cells remodel glucose into macromolecules and
  exhibit a higher glycolytic flux than that of the BRAFV600E mutant cells resistant
  to sorafenib treatment
caption: a Scheme showing the labeling of cells with [U-13C6 glucose and the posterior
  identification of the possible intermediate isotopologues by mass spectrometry.
  b Glycolytic pathway and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) diagram showing the distribution
  of the labeled carbons from [U-13C6] glucose into the possible intermediate isotopologues.
  c Graph showing the amount of the indicated glycolytic intermediate M + 3 isotopologs
  in BRAFV600E- and NRASQ61-mutant melanoma cells under normal growth conditions.
  Bars represent the mean ± SD (n = 4 biologically independent samples; unpaired two-sided
  t test, ns = not significant). d Graph showing the amount of the indicated M + 3
  isotopologues glycolytic intermediates in sorafenib-treated and nontreated BRAFV600E
  and NRASQ61 mutant melanoma cells. Bars represent the mean ± SD (n = 4 biologically
  independent samples; unpaired two-sided t test). e Graphs showing the relative intensity
  of the indicated molecules under basal conditions and after 1 h of GS in BRAFV600E-
  and NRASQ61-mutant melanoma cells. Bars represent the mean ± SD (n = 4 biologically
  independent samples; unpaired two-sided t test, ns not significant). C Control;
  GS glucose starvation; Sor. Sorafenib.
