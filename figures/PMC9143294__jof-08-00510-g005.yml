caption: Effects of BlnR on the development of asexual conidiospore and filamentous
  growth. (A) A total of 103 spores were spotted on a PDA plate for growth at 26 °C
  for 7 days. (B) Comparison of colony size between the wild-type and blnROVE (n =
  10) strains. “**” indicates the significant difference with the p-value < 0.01.
  (C) Microscopic observation of hyphae and spores. The red arrows indicate spores.
  (D) qRT-PCR analysis of spore-development-related regulators (n = 3).
