caption: 'CAPN5 mediates the activation of inflammation via the NF-κB/IκBα signaling
  pathway in BEAS-2B cells: a) Cell lysates of the si-NC and si-CAPN5 groups were
  analyzed for CAPN5, p65, p-p65, IκBα, p-IκBα or β-actin expression by immunoblotting;
  b) Cell lysates of the oe-vector, oe-vector+CSE and oe-CAPN5+CSE groups were analyzed
  for CAPN5, p65, p-p65, IκBα, p-IκBα or β-actin expression by immunoblotting'
