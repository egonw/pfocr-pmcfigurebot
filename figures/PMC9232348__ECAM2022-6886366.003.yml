caption: 'Curcumin can regulate the expressions of ER stress-related proteins in DDP-resistant
  NSCLC cells. (a–d) qPCR and western blotting detected the expressions of reticulum
  stress-related proteins, CHOP, GRP78, XBP-1, ATF6, and caspase-4; experiment data
  are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD), each experiment was conducted
  3 times. #P < 0.05, when compared with the control group; &P < 0.05, when compared
  with the DDP or the curcumin group. DDP, cisplatin; NSCLC, non-small-cell lung cancer;
  and ER stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress.'
article_title: Curcumin Increased the Sensitivity of Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer to
  Cisplatin through the Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Pathway.
