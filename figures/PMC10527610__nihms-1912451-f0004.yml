figure_title: Elevated GOMAFU expression suppresses a subset of IFN pathway genes
  in specific postmortem brain regions of SCZ subjects
caption: (A-C) Reduction of selective Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs) identified
  as DEGs of Î”GOMAFU in brain regions derived from SCZ subjects (GSE53987, GSE80655)
  that harbor increased GOMAFU expression. Hippocampus (n = 15), Nucleus accumbens
  (n = 22), Striatum (n = 18). Multiple test corrections were conducted, with *denotes
  false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05, **denotes FDR < 0.01. (D-F) Linear regression
  analysis shows significant negative correlation between expression levels of GOMAFU
  and ISG mRNAs in postmortem hippocampus (GSE53987). (GOMAFU and IFIT1, p = 0.0022,
  R2= 0.2641; GOMAFU and STAT1, p = 0.0009, R2=0.3013; GOMAFU and RNF19B, p = 0.0025,
  R2= 0.2584). The SCZ and CON subjects showed similar trends of negative correlation
  between GOMAFU and its targets, but not all reached statistical significance due
  to small sample sizes (), hence data are combined for the above plots.
