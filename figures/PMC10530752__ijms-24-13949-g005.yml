caption: Effects of piperine on tumor growth inhibition in vivo. Nude mice bearing
  HSC-3 cells as xenograft models were treated with piperine (0, 50 mg/kg daily for
  4 weeks), and (A) tumor volume, (B) tumor weight and (C) body weight were measured.
  (D) H&E staining performed for the liver and kidney.
