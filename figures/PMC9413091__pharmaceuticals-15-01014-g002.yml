caption: GO and KEGG enrichment analyses of galangin in the treatment of PD. (A) Visualization
  of 20 terms of molecular function enrichment analysis. (B) Visualization of 14 terms
  of cellular component enrichment analysis. (C) Visualization of 21 terms of biological
  process enrichment analysis. (D) GO analysis of core targets of galangin in the
  treatment of PD. Four terms of CC, 6 terms of BP, and 10 terms of MF showing the
  greatest enrichment of galangin-related processes are listed according to p values.
  (E) The top 20 KEGG pathways enrichment analysis involved in the potential treatment
  of galangin in PD.
