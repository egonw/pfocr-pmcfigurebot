caption: GO and KEGG enrichment analyses of the host genes of DE RNAs separately.
  (A) GO enrichment analysis of the host genes of DE circRNAs. The horizontal coordinate
  is the GO classification, the left side of the vertical coordinate is the percentage
  of the number of genes enriched in that GO term, and the right side is the number
  of genes. (B) KEGG enrichment analysis of the host genes of DE circRNAs. Each circle
  in  represents a KEGG pathway, the vertical coordinate indicates the top 20 pathway
  names, and the horizontal coordinate is the enrichment factor, which represents
  the ratio of the proportion of differential genes annotated to a pathway (gene ratio)
  to the proportion of all genes annotated to that pathway (background ratio). The
  colour of the circle represents the q value, which is the P value after correction
  for multiple hypothesis testing, and the size of the circle indicates the number
  of genes enriched in the pathway. (C) GO enrichment analysis of the host genes of
  DE lncRNAs. (D) KEGG enrichment analysis of the host genes of DE circRNAs. (E) GO
  enrichment analysis of the host genes of DE miRNAs. (F) KEGG enrichment analysis
  of the host genes of DE miRNAs.
