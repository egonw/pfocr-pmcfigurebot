caption: Enhancement of colanic acid production by overexpression of precursors. (A)
  The metabolic pathway of glucose in Escherichia coli K-12 and the structure of colanic
  acid. (B) Colanic acid titers of SP recombinant strains in TBG medium at 30 °C in
  shake flasks. (C) Growth curves of SP recombinant strains in TBG medium at 30 °C
  in shake flasks. (D) Colanic acid titers of SRP recombinant strains in TBG medium
  at 30 °C in shake flasks. (E) Colanic acid titers of the SRP-4 strain in TBG medium
  at different temperatures in shake flasks. Statistical data analysis was performed
  with t-texts in SPSS 25.0. p values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant,
  and statistical significance is indicated as * for p < 0.05 and ** for p < 0.01.
