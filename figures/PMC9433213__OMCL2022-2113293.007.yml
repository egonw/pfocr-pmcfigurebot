caption: 'Effects of curcumin on DHT-induced ER stress in ovarian GCs mediated via
  increasing of PI3K/AKT phosphorylation. (a, b) Western blot results showing the
  changes of the p-PI3K, PI3K, p-AKT, and AKT levels in GCs treated with DHT and 740-YP
  (a PI3K activator). (c, d) The p-IRE1α expression level in GCs treated with DHT,
  740-YP, and curcumin by immunofluorescence staining (60x). (e, f) Changes in ER
  stress-related protein p-IRE1α, IRE1α, XBP1, GRP-78, and CHOP levels in GCs treated
  with DHT and 740-YP as detected by western blot. Three independent experiments were
  performed with similar results. Data are shown as the mean ± SEM. ∗∗p < 0.05 and
  ∗∗p < 0.05 vs. DMSO group; ##p < 0.05 vs. DHT group.'
