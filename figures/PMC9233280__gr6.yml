caption: Transcriptomic analysis of RPE suggests upregulated stress, inflammation,
  and EMT pathways. (A) Volcano plot of DEGs determined from pairwise comparison of
  RDC vs RC RPE at P120. Statistically significant genes above 1.5 log2 fold changed
  are marked in blue (upregulated genes) or red (downregulated genes). (B) Log p-value
  of statistically significant upregulated pathways. (C) Heat map of DEGs involved
  in hypoxia and angiogenesis, presented as log2FC of normalized gene expression.
  (D) Heat map of DEGs involved in TNF-α signaling, general inflammation, and the
  complement pathway presented as log2FC of normalized gene expression. (E) Statically
  significant genes associated with EMT. Genes were separated into broad categories
  of “ECM remodeling” and “Genes implicated in EMT”. DEGs are presented as FPKM (fragments
  per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads). Each group had an n value
  of 4 samples and each sample contained 4 pooled RPEs with selections were intentionally
  spread over two/three separate litters. Those RPEs were the corresponding tissue
  for the neural retina samples analyzed in . Statistical analysis was assessed by
  t-test with FDR correction for multiple tests (** = p < 0.01, *** = p < 0.001) for
  comparisons between RC and RDC fed animals. Plotted as means ± SEM. (For interpretation
  of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
