caption: miR-31-5p antagomir may transform macrophages from M1 type to M2 type through
  the AMPK-related pathway. (A) miR-31-5p antagomir was successfully transfected into
  RAW264.7 cells. (B) qPCR detection of AMPK, NOS2, and Arg1 mRNAs. (C) Western blotting
  strips of P-AMPK/AMPK, NOS2, Arg1, NOX2, HADHB (β-actin). (D) Protein quantitative
  analysis of P-AMPK/AMPK, NOS2, Arg1, NOX2 and HADHB (β-actin). (E) Flow cytometry
  of M1/M2. (F) Statistical analysis of M1/M2 cell ratio. Each bar represents mean
  ± SD, n = 8 from each group. Ns represented P > 0.05, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P
  < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001 vs. LPS group.
