caption: 'Ingenuity pathway analysis of homeobox A10 activity in hepatitis B-related
  hepatocellular carcinoma. Homeobox A10 signaling has potential implications on tumor
  suppression, liver metabolism, and other disease-related activity. Genes and location
  are shown above. Legend illustrates relationship between genes and gene classification.
