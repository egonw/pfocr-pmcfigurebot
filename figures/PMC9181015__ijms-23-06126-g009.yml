caption: 'DEGs involved in abscisic acid, brassinosteroid, and salicylic acid signaling
  pathways. (A–C) Abscisic acid, brassinosteroid, and salicylic acid signal transduction
  pathways by referring to the KO04075 pathway in KEGG enrichment analysis. (D) Heatmaps
  showing the relative expression of DEGs involved in the above-mentioned hormone
  signaling pathways. The purple boxes indicate the genes in which expression was
  significantly changed by 9 w vs. 13 w. 9 w: vegetative stage, 13 w: shifts to the
  reproductive stage at the gene level, 15 w: reproductive stage. The column with
  the black boxes represents the student’s t test analysis of DEGs by 9 w vs. 13 w;
  The column with the pink boxes represents the student’s t test analysis of DEGs
  by 13 w vs. 15 w; The column with the blue boxes represents the student’s t test
  analysis of DEGs by 9 w vs. 15 w. (* |Log2FC| ≥ 1, p < 0.05. ** |Log2FC| ≥ 2, p
  < 0.01).'
