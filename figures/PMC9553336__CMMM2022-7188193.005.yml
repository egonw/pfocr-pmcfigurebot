caption: 'Screening the miR-204-5p binding circRNAs and validating their expression
  pattern by FPKM analysis. (a) An overlapping number of miR-204-5p binding circRNAs
  and differentially expressed circRNAs in DM and control retina (DM-up: upregulated
  circRNAs in diabetic retinopathy; DM-down: downregulated circRNAs in diabetic retinopathy).
  (b) Validation of circRNA expression by FPKM analysis. Bars represent mean ± SEM
  (∗p < 0.05; DM: diabetic cataract; FC: fold change). ∗p < 0.05.'
