caption: PIPKIγ regulates PD-L1 expression via activation of NF-κB. (A) The effects
  of PIPKIγ knockdown on the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway in SW480 and LoVo
  cells were analyzed by Western blotting. (B) The effects of PIPKIγ overexpression
  on the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway in HCT116 and SW620 cells were analyzed
  by Western blotting. (C) The effects of PIPKIγ knockdown on the transcriptional
  activity of NF-κB in SW480 and LoVo cells were determined by luciferase reporter
  assay. (D) The effects of PIPKIγ overexpression on the transcriptional activity
  of NF-κB in HCT116 and SW620 cells were determined by luciferase reporter assay.
  (E) The effects of NF-κB inhibitor Bay11-7082 on the transcriptional activity of
  NF-κB in SW480 and LoVo cells were determined by luciferase reporter assay. (F)
  The effects of Bay11-7082 on the mRNA level of PD-L1 in SW480 and LoVo cells were
  determined by real-time qPCR analysis. (G) The effects of CA-IKKβ on the NF-κB transcriptional
  activity in sh-PIPKIγ SW480 cells were determined by luciferase reporter assay.
  (H) Western blotting analysis of the effect of CA-IKKβ on NF-κB pathway and PD-L1
  expression. (I) The impact of CA-IKKβ on the cell proliferation of sh-PIPKIγ SW480
  cells was determined by plate colony assay. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01. P values are
  derived from Student paired t-test (C, D, G) or the ANOVA followed by post hoc Tukey's
  multiple comparison test (E, F, I).
