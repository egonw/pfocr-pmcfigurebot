figure_title: The main cytosolic DNA sensors and their downstream pathways
caption: Functional dimeric cGAS catalyzes the conversion of ATP and GTP into 2,3-cGAMP
  when bound to dsDNA. DDX41 only binds one strand of DNA, and its helicase domain
  reserves the ability to unwind or anneal DNA strands. The HIN200 family members,
  IFI16 and AIM2, tend to oligomerize in order to detect dsDNA. In addition to detecting
  dsDNA, ZBP1 is capable of transforming Z-DNA to B-DNA. cGAS, DDX41, and IFI16 all
  activate STING to initiate their downstream effects, with cGAS relying on 2,3-cGAMP,
  while IFI16 and DDX41 require direct self-binding. STING mainly triggers the release
  of inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-I through the TBK1/IKKÎµ-IRF3/STAT6 pathway
  and also contributes to autophagy and metabolic alterations. ZBP1 can activate the
  TBK1-IRF3 pathway independently of STING and induce necroptosis or apoptosis depending
  on the balance between RIPK1 and RIPK3. Unlike other cytosolic DNA sensors, AIM2
  does not exert its biological effect through STING or IFN-I; instead, AIM2 takes
  part in the formation of an inflammasome. IFI16 also recruits inflammasomes, but
  the mechanism that determines whether IFI16 prefers to bind inflammasomes or STING
  remains unknown.
