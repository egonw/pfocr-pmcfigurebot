caption: Tumor sensitization to CD8+ T and NK cells by RNF31 depletion is relayed
  through TNF signaling(A) Incucyte analysis by caspase-3/7 GFP accumulation for apoptosis
  of D10 cells expressing indicated sgRNAs and challenged with different numbers of
  MART-1 CD8+ T cells (left), NK cells (middle), or TNF (right). Quantification of
  positive caspase-3/7 staining cells per well (n = 3), error bars indicate SD. Other
  tumor:T cell ratios are shown in C–S5F.(B) BLM sgCtl or sgRNF31 cells were treated
  with HOIPIN-8 or vehicle, then stimulated with biotin-TNF (100 ng/mL) for 10 min.
  TNFR1 complex I proteins were purified by biotin co-immunoprecipitation and analyzed
  by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The mean PSM count of TNFR1 complex
  components for three replicates were plotted in a heatmap.(C) Volcano plots showing
  relative abundance of TNFR1 complex components in sensitive tumor cells (sgRNF31,
  HOIPIN-8, sgRNF31+HOIPIN-8) versus resistant tumor cells (sgCtl, vehicle). TNFR1
  complex proteins are color coded by subcomplex. Horizontal line indicates p < 0.01,
  vertical lines indicate fold change > 2, n = 3 biological replicates per condition.(D)
  Phosphorylation of RIPK1 at Ser166 within the TNFR1 complex measured following biotin-TNF
  immunoprecipitation-MS in (B). The phosphorylation abundance is normalized to total
  RIPK1 abundance. n = 3 biological replicates per condition. Error bars indicate
  SD. ∗∗∗p < 0.001 by unpaired two-sided Student’s t test.(E–H) mRNA sequencing analysis
  of sensitive (sgRNF31, HOIPIN-8) and resistant (sgCtl, vehicle) BLM tumor cells
  after exposure to TNF. BLM cells were preincubated with either vehicle (DMSO) or
  HOIPIN-8 for 16 h, followed by stimulation with TNF (100 ng/mL) for 0 and 6 h. n =
  2 biological replicates per condition. The Venn diagram (E) represents the number
  of all significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) regulated following 6 h
  of TNF stimulation between sgRNF31 versus sgCtl and HOIPIN-8 versus sgCtl. The significant
  DEGs are cut off at fold change > 1.5, FDR < 0.05 in N. The heatmap (F) illustrates
  the normalized expression of significant DEGs from (D) across samples common to
  genetic and pharmacologic RNF31 inhibition. GSEA plots (G and H) show a downregulated
  NF-κB signaling pathway in both RNF31 knockout and HOIPIN-8 inhibited cells after
  TNF treatment.
