caption: Leukocyte infiltration in kidney tissue. (a) Immunohistochemical staining
  for F4/80 in tubulointerstitium. (b) Immunostaining staining for F4/80 in renal
  corpuscle of kidney tissue. (c) Immunohistochemical staining for CD45 in tubulointerstitium.
  (d) Immunostaining staining for CD45 in renal corpuscle of kidney tissue. Ten non‐overlapping
  fields for tubulointerstitium and 10 non‐overlapping fields of renal corpuscle sections
  were imaged at 60× magnification from each kidney section (n = 3 mice/group). The
  positive stained cells were counted manually in a double blinded manner and the
  data subjected to 2‐way ANOVA. a–c means values with different letters are significantly
  different (p < 0.0001). The data show that meprin β enhanced leukocyte infiltration
  in both tubulointerstitium and renal corpuscles at 24 h post‐IR.
