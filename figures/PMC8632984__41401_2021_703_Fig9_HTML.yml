figure_title: Biological pathway networks mediated by darapladib in hypertensive cardiac
  remodeling
caption: ClueGO analysis of genes regulated by darapladib in Ang II-infused hearts.
  These networks are functionally grouped by enriched categories of target genes.
  Different functional groups of GO terms (biological process) are represented as
  nodes in different colors (pink nodes represent GO terms associated with inflammation;
  green nodes, proliferation; blue nodes, fibrosis, and hypertrophy). Shared genes
  are represented by yellow nodes, and Pla2g7 gene is represented by the red node.
  The edge between nodes reflects shared genes in different GO terms, or the connections
  between GO terms. Anxa2 annexin A2, Ccna2 cyclin A2, Ccnb1 cyclin B1, Cdc6 cell
  division cycle 6, Col14a1 collagen type XIV alpha 1, Dusp1 dual specificity phosphatase
  1, Edn1 endothelin 1, E2f1 E2F transcription factor 1, Fn1 fibronectin 1, Igf1 insulin-like
  growth factor 1, Sfrp1 secreted frizzled-related protein 1.
