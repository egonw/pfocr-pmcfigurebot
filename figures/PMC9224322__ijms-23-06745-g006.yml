caption: 'Under low Na+ diet, the production of aldosterone was uncoupled from the
  renin-angiotensin system in Prss8PaxLC1 Ko mice. (A) Plasma aldosterone levels in
  control (black square n = 11) and knockout mice (Ko, white square n = 6–11) under
  low Na+ diet and treated or not with losartan (10mg/kgBW) for 7 days. (B) Natriuretic
  response expressed as fractional excretion of Na+ (in %) in control (black square
  n = 6) and knockout mice (Ko, white square n = 6) treated with vehicle or acute
  treatment of benzamil (0.2mg/kgBW). All groups were treated during 7 days with losartan
  (10mg/kgBW). Results are presented as mean ± SD. (A) was analyzed by an unpaired
  two-tailed t test. (B) was analyzed with a two-way ANOVA with a Sidak’s multiple
  comparisons test (column factor: genotype; row factor: treatment). p values < 0.05
  were considered statistically significant. * p < 0.05.'
