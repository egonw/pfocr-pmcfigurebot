caption: RUNX1 regulates BMP2 to promote vasculogenic mimicry in LSCC. A-B IHC results
  of RUNX1, BMP2 and CD34/PAS in LSCC tissue. C, E, F Tubule formation and spheroid
  invasion assays. D, G, H Transwell migration assay and transwell invasion assay.
  I Three groups (NC + NC, NC + shRUNX1, shRUNX1 + BMP2) of solid tumors were observed.
  J Curves of xenograft tumor growth in nude BALB/c mice (n = 4). K IHC staining for
  RUNX1, BMP2 and CD34/PAS in tumor tissues of nude mice. L Western blot analysis
  of EMT-related proteins and the AKT signaling pathway. M, N Kaplan–Meier curve for
  the 5-year overall survival rate of RUNX1 and BMP2. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001,
  one-way ANOVA and two-way ANOVA
