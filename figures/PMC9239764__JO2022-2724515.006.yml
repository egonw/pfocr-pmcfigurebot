caption: Knockdown of ARL4C inhibits proliferation of 786-O and ACHN cells. (a-b)
  or ACHN and 786-O cells, CCK-8 analysis was used to detect the OD values of the
  si-NC and si-ARL4C groups after 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, and a line graph was generated.
  (c-d) Colony formation assay was used to determine the proliferation of ACHN and
  786-O cells in the si-NC and si-ARL4C groups. (e-f) EdU assay was used to determine
  the proliferation ACHN and 786-O cells in the si-NC and si-ARL4C groups. (g) The
  number of colonies was counted using Image-Pro Plus software and represented as
  a histogram. (h) EdU incorporation was calculated using Image-Pro Plus software
  and represented as a histogram. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗P <
  0.0001.
