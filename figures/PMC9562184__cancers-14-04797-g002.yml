caption: HDAC1 represses the activity of CREPT in promoting tumorigenesis. Stable
  cell lines were established for the overexpression of HDAC1 (HDAC1 OE) alone, CREPT
  (CREPT OE) alone, and both HDAC1 and CREPT (HDAC1&CREPT OE) in DLD1 cells, as well
  as for the deletion of HDAC1 (siHDAC1) or deletion of CREPT (CREPT KO) in SW480
  cells. An empty vector was used as a control (EV) for overexpression experiments
  in DLD1 cells and a non-specific siRNA (siNC) was used as a control for deletion
  experiments in SW480 cells. Indicated stable cell lines were cultured for the CCK8
  experiment at different days. A colony formation experiment was performed. A statistic
  result for the colony numbers as scanned by Image J is presented on the right panel.
  (A–D). Ectopic expression of HDAC1 significantly inhibits cell proliferation (A,B)
  or colony formation (C,D) in the presence of overexpressed CREPT in DLD1 cells.
  (E–H). Knocking down the expression of HDAC1 elevates cell proliferation (E,F) or
  colony formation (G,H) in the absence of CREPT in SW480 cells. The bands were quantified
  using ImageJ and presented as a value normalized according to the moderate level
  of a band in each blot. (I–K). Overexpression of HDAC1 inhibits the tumor formation
  in the presence of overexpressed CREPT by Lovo cells in nude mice. (L). HDAC1 blocks
  the activity of CREPT in regulating the Wnt signaling pathway. Super-TOP-luciferase
  reporter (0.1 μg), pRL-TK (50 ng), HA–HDACs (0.1 μg) and Myc–CREPT (0.4 μg) were
  co-transfected into HEK293T cells. Luciferase activity is presented as a relative
  value based on the internal control (renilla signal). (M). HDAC1 inhibits the expression
  of CREPT-activated genes. The mRNA levels of CCND1, CLDN1, VEGFA, BMP4, PPARD, p21
  and p27 were examined in DLD1 cell lines. (ns, not significantly, * p < 0.05, **
  p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001).
