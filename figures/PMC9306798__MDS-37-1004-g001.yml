caption: Pairwise comparisons of proteomic and phospho‐proteomic data in LRRK2 G2019S
  carriers and idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD) and biological enrichment analysis.
  (A) Barplot representation of the number of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs;
  upregulated and downregulated proteins) and differentially phosphorylated proteins
  (DPPs; hyperphosphorylated and hypophosphorylated peptides) in pairwise comparisons
  involving G2019S LRRK2‐associated Parkinson's disease (L2PD), G2019S LRRK2 nonmanifesting
  carrier (L2NMC), and iPD by 2‐tailed Student t test (P < 0.05). Although the number
  of DEPs was similar for most of the comparisons, the highest number of phosphorylation
  differences was observed between G2019S L2PD and G2019S L2NMC. (B) Venn diagrams
  representing the numbers of common and specific DEPs and DPPs showing distinct patterns
  in G2019S L2PD, G2019S L2NMC, and iPD with respect to healthy controls, yet with
  a higher degree of overlap between G2019S L2PD and G2019S L2NMC and a poor overlap
  with iPD. (C) Biological enrichment analysis of interlocked DEPs and DPPs in G2019S
  L2PD, G2019S L2NMC, and iPD compared with healthy controls using Metascape with
  false discovery rate (FDR) multiple testing adjustment of P values (adj. P < 0.05)
  (dashed line). This analysis showed common pathway alteration not only for G2019S
  carriers but also for iPD. [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]
