caption: 'Proteomic profiling of signaling pathways in LuCaP PDX tumors shows a high
  degree of intra-tumor and inter-tumor correlation. (a) A schematic showing the overall
  goal and design of our study to integrate proteomic and transcriptomic profiling
  in LuCaP PDX tumors. The resulting state of signaling pathways is then validated
  in model cell lines and PDX tumors using pathway-specific inhibitors. (b) A schematic
  illustrating RPPA and properties of validated antibodies used in this study. Right:
  pie charts showing the distribution of all antibodies tested and those yielding
  positive signals broken down by different targets, PTMs, and subcellular localization.
  * refers to antibodies detecting cleaved caspases. (c) A heatmap showing the correlation
  between three different tumor samples from each LuCaP PDX model. Sample tumor 1
  is used as a reference, and the numbers indicate Pearson correlation. (d) A heatmap
  showing a strong positive correlation within AR-null and AR-positive LuCaP PDX models.'
