caption: 'The concept of GPCR signaling: biased signaling. (A) G protein-biased agonist.
  Biased agonists selectively activate the GPCR-dependent signaling pathway. Previous
  studies demonstrate that sustained G protein-mediated signaling can affect cellular
  response through second messenger activation. (B) β-Arrestin biased agonist. Biased
  agonists selectively activate the β-arrestin-dependent signaling pathway. The β-arrestin-mediated
  signaling leads to distinct physiological outcomes. (C) Balanced agonist. Balanced
  agonists activate both the G protein- and β-arrestin-dependent signaling pathway.'
