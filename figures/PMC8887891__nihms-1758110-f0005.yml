caption: Another application of the cytomorphic chip. The p53 pathway is critical
  in cancer biology. (a) – (b) The p53 pathway can be simulated (a) deterministically
  and (b) stochastically using MATLAB software. (c) – (d) The cytomorphic chip achieves
  equally good results in both (c) deterministic and (d) stochastic emulations of
  the p53 pathway. Reprinted with permission from [], Copyright 2018 IEEE.
