figure_title: CD44 and NUMB isoform-specific expression affects cell migration and
  Notch signaling activation
caption: (A) Migration assay analysis of HCT116 CD44s-, CD44v6-, and NUMB1/4-OE cells.
  EpCAMlo and EpCAMhi cells were used as controls. Each bar represents the mean ±
  SD of cells migrated to the bottom of the transwell from two independent experiments.
  (n=3) (B) Migration assay analysis of SW480 CD44s-, CD44v6-, and NUMB1/4-OE cells.
  EpCAMlo and EpCAMhi cells were used as controls. Each bar represents the mean ±
  SD of cells migrated to the bottom of the transwell from two independent experiments.
  (n=3) (C) RT-qPCR analysis of EMT-TFs in HCT116 and SW480 CD44s-, CD44v6-, and NUMB1/4-OE
  cells. GAPDH expression was used as control, normalized with the HCT116 or SW480
  parental in each sample (means ± SEM, n=3). Increased gene expression is depicted
  by red bars, whereas downregulation – when compared with parental cells – is shown
  by blue bar. (D) RT-qPCR analysis of the Notch signaling pathway markers HES1, HEY1,
  and ID2 in HCT116 and SW480 NUMB1/4-OE cells. GAPDH expression was used as control
  (means ± SEM, n=3). *=p < 0.05; **=p < 0.01.
