caption: 'Histological changes of the myocardial tissues after myocardial infarction
  (MI). Histological changes evaluation of the myocardial tissues in all groups of
  mice. (A) Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed at 3 days after MI.
  Red arrow: damaged myofibrils, star: increased spaces between the myofibrils, black
  arrow: infiltrated inflammatory cells. (B) The mRNA expression level of IL-6, IL-1β,
  and TNF-α in myocardial tissue in all groups of mice at 3 days after MI. (C) Masson’s
  trichrome staining was performed at 28 days after MI. a, b, c, d means sham, MI,
  MI+LV-shRNA-NC and MI+LV-shRNA-lysosomal-associated protein transmembrane 5 (LAPTM5),
  respectively. Statistical evaluation was performed by one-way analysis of variance
  with Tukey post hoc test. Data were expressed as mean ± SD. **P<0.01. n=6 for each
  group.'
