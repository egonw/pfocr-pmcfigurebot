caption: scRNA-seq analysis of TI characteristics(A) Pathway enrichment analysis using
  up- and downregulated TIGs in high and low responders in monocytes separately. Pink
  area means pathways were upregulated, while the blue area means pathways were downregulated.
  Different patterns were shown between high and low responders. Specifically, IFN-γ
  pathways were upregulated in high responders but downregulated in low responders.
  See also C–S2J.(B) Effect size (log2FC) comparison of TIGs identified in monocytes.
  Values on the x axis were log2FC in high responders, while values on the y axis
  were from low responders. Yellow dots represent those TIGs only significant in high
  responders while dark-blue ones were only significant in low responders. Gray dots
  represent TIGs that were significant in both groups.(C) Enriched pathways using
  TIGs that were significantly upregulated in high responders but downregulated in
  low responders. See also A.(D and E) Cell-cell interaction between monocytes and
  CD8+ T cells. Ligands were highly variable genes in senders, and targets were TIGs
  in receivers. In (D), monocytes were set as sender, while in (E) CD8+ T cells were
  set as sender. See also B–S3E.
