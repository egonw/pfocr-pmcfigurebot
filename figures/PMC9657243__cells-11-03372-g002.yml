caption: 'Means (SEs) of circulating metabolites and hormones ((a–f): glucose, insulin,
  non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs), glucagon, acetoacetate (AcAc), β-hydroxybutyrate
  (BHB)) measured from blood draws over a 34-h window (22 timepoints) starting at
  8 am in the morning and finishing at 6 pm the next afternoon (i.e., every 1.5 h
  × 2, 1 h × 1, 1.5 h × 8, 2 h × 4, 1.5 h × 2, 1 h × 1, and finally 1.5 h × 4), at
  baseline (visit 1 (V1)), immediately before and after the first empagliflozin dose
  (visit 2 (V2)), and immediately before and after the last empagliflozin dose (visit
  3 (V3)). Statistical analysis involved repeated-measures linear mixed models with
  “Visit” as the repeated-measures variable and additional variables as factors and
  covariates (see  for details). Significance is indicated in the graphs when type
  III tests of fixed effects for “Visit” and pairwise comparisons between “Visits”
  were significant. Significance symbols ns, *, **, *** correspond to p > 0.05, p
  ≤ 0.05, p ≤ 0.01 and p ≤ 0.001, respectively.'
