caption: 'CHRNB2 represses the migration and invasion via ACh-independent mechanisms.
  A mRNA levels of CHRNB2 in 6 cases of pancreatic cancer with paired normal pancreas
  and tumor tissue. B CHRNB2 mRNA levels in the tumor tissue of 6 pancreatic cancer
  patients. 3 cases with LNR = 0, other 3 cases with LNR = 1, examined lymph node > 11.
  C mRNA levels of CHRNB2 in normal pancreatic ductal epithelial cell line and 6 pancreatic
  cancer cell lines. D Protein levels of CHRNB2 in 6 pancreatic cancer cell lines.
  E Efficiency of CHRNB2 knockdown by siRNA in PANC1. F Efficiency of CHRNB2 overexpression
  by plasmid in T3M4. G, I–L Downregulating CHRNB2 could ACh-independently increase
  the migration and invasion of PANC1. H, M–P Overexpressing CHRNB2 could ACh-independently
  decrease the migration and invasion of T3M4. (*: P < 0.05; **: P < 0.01; ***: P < 0.001)'
