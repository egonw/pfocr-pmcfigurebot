caption: Schematic diagram showing regulation of ferroptosis by the PPARα signaling
  pathway in HMCs. Gd-IgA1 stimulates HMCs, leading to downregulated expression of
  PPARα, which in turn leads to decreased FABP1 expression. Levels of GPX4 and GSH,
  which participate in ferroptosis inhibition, decrease. ACSL4 promotion of ferroptosis
  and ROS levels increase, contributing to lipid peroxidation. Ultimately, ferroptosis
  of HMCs occurs, leading to IgAN.
