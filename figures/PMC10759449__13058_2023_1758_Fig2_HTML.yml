caption: PDIA4 promoted cell proliferation in TNBC. A PDIA4 knockdown TNBC cells was
  constructed by infecting MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells with lentivirus, and the
  expression efficiency of the cells was assessed through western blot and RT-PCR.
  B Lentivirus transfected TNBC cells with PDIA4 overexpression, and western blot
  and RT-PCR were used to detect the efficiency. C The effects of PDIA4 on TNBC cells
  proliferation were assessed using the CCK-8 assay. Results indicated that overexpression
  of PDIA4 could promote cell proliferation, while downregulation of PDIA4 was able
  to significantly inhibit cell proliferation. All data are shown as the mean ± S.D.
  of at least three independent experiments. The P values were calculated using unpaired
  Student’s t test. *P < 0.05; ***P < 0.001
