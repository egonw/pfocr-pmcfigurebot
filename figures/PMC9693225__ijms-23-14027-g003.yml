caption: 'Functional STRING networks of proteins extracted from gametophytes of Dryopteris
  affinis ssp. affinis and D. oreades. Only high confidence interactions (0.7) are
  shown. Abbreviations of proteins are reported in  and . (a) Growth and reproduction:
  red color refers to anatomical structure development, and blue to systems development.
  (b) Phytohormones: blue color refers to positive regulation of abscisic acid-activated
  signaling pathway, red to endocytosis, and green to regulation of biological quality.
  (c) Gene expression: red color refers to chromatin organization, and blue to translation.
  (d) Abiotic stress: blue color refers to protein folding, DnaJ domain and HSP90
  proteins; red to glutathione metabolism, superoxide dismutase activity, and redox-active
  center; and green to biosynthesis of secondary metabolites.'
