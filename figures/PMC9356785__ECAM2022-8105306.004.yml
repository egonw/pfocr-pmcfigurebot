caption: 'Analysis of network pharmacology related to HJRG. (a) The flower plot of
  the active ingredients in HJRG. The pink circle in the center represents the 117
  active ingredients of HJRG. Each petal corresponds to the number of compounds in
  the corresponding Chinese medicine. (b) The flower plot of the potential target
  in HJRG. The pink circle in the center represents the 261 potential targets of HJRG.
  Each petal corresponds to the number of potential targets in the corresponding Chinese
  medicine. (c) A Venn diagram showing that HJRG shares 219 potential targets with
  the targets of liver fibrosis. (d) The component-target network. (e) PPI network
  analysis of potential targets. (f) Top 10 items of BP, CC, and MF in the GO enrichment
  analysis of potential targets. BP: biological process; CC: cellular component; MF:
  molecular function. (g) Top 15 items of the KEGG pathway analysis of the potential
  targets.'
