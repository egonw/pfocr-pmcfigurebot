caption: Possible model of catechin stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis and downregulates
  the Warburg effect, reprinted/adapted with permission from Ref. []. 2015, Shay,
  J. et al. Epicatechin may stimulate mitochondrial respiration and biogenesis, and
  repress the Warburg effect. At the cell signal transduction pathway level, epicatechin
  can also inhibit extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) signaling. Through
  Erk and/or other signaling pathways, epicatechin can activate mitochondrial OXPHOS,
  which intervenes with the Warburg metabolism. Additionally, through repressing signaling
  pathways (such as nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-ÎºB), protein kinase B (Akt), and
  histone acetyltransferases (HATs)), epicatechin can induce apoptosis in the cancer
  cells.
