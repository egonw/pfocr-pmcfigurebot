caption: 'Behavioral assessments in lumbar disc herniation (LDH) rats with moxibustion
  treatment of Hui medicine (HMM). Locomotor activity tests (a) and tactile function
  tests (b) were performed to assess the success of LDH rat models. Locomotor activity
  tests (c) and tactile function tests (d) were performed with or without the moxibustion
  treatment of Hui medicine. A negative value of paw withdrawal latency indicates
  mechanical hyperalgesia. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. the normal
  group; #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01 vs. the LDH group; and ΔP < 0.05 vs. the HMM group.'
