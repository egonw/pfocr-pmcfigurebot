caption: 'a The three major pipelines of this study are depicted. b Initially, three
  signatures were built: two signatures built with each of the FOXM1 and PPARA pathways
  alone and a third signature built with the two pathways together. c Next, the pathway
  activity scores of the FOXM1- and PPARA-pathway signatures based on genome-wide
  expression data with drug treatment were computed by the DART algorithm to identify
  drugs inducing the activity score changes of the two pathways. d In parallel, the
  connectivity scores for the FOXM1- and PPARA-pathway signatures were computed by
  the CMAP online tool to identify drugs reversing the expression pattern of the two
  pathway signatures. Finally, the intersection of the drugs identified from the two
  pipelines (c, d) were considered as drugs influencing the activity of the FOXM1
  or PPARA pathways. In addition, connectivity scores for the FOXM1/PPARA-pathway
  signature were computed by CMAP online tool to identify drugs reversing expression
  pattern of the two pathways simultaneously.'
