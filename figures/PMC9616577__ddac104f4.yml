caption: 'Differentially methylated genes in both genotypes were enriched for locomotor
  behavior and glutamate signaling functions. (A) GO biological process terms enriched
  at multifunctionality-corrected, multiple test-corrected hypergeometric p-value
  (CorrectedMFPvalue) < 0.05 in genes shared between control (n = 7 biological replicates)
  vs. WT aSyn (n = 8) and control vs. A30P aSyn (n = 8) DNAm analyses. (B) Heat map
  showing beta values for all probes annotated to the ‘locomotory behavior’ pathway
  and differentially methylated in at least one comparison. Row labels (left to right):
  probes that passed significance thresholds (absolute delta beta ≥0.05 and padj ≤ 0.05,
  limma empirical Bayes moderated t test with Benjamini–Hochberg adjustment) in control
  vs. WT aSyn comparison, probes that passed significance thresholds in control vs.
  A30P aSyn comparison. (C) Representative examples of 353 total locomotory behavior-related
  CpG sites differentially methylated only in WT aSyn cells (DAB1 padj = 1.91e−4,
  CRH padj = 9.34e−5). (D) Representative examples of 22 total locomotory behavior-related
  CpG sites differentially methylated only in A30P aSyn cells (CYTH2 padj = 1e−5,
  FXYD1 padj = 0.028). (E) Representative examples of 67 total locomotory behavior-related
  CpG sites differentially methylated in both genotypes (PCDH15 WT aSyn padj = 7.8e−6,
  PCDH15 A30P aSyn padj = 8.61e−5, PAPP2 WT aSyn padj = 1.68e−9, PAPP2 A30P aSyn padj = 3.55e−7).
