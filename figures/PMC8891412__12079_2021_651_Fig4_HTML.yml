caption: Prognostic value of hypoxia-related lncRNA and construction of a risk signature
  predicting prognosis. a The risk scores for all EC patients in entire cohort are
  plotted in ascending order, and marked as high-risk (red) and low-risk (blue), as
  divided by the threshold. b Survival days of EC patients were showed in ascending
  order of risk parameters. c, d The forest plot of univariate (c) and multivariate
  (d) Cox regression analysis in the cohorts. e Heatmap shows the association of risk
  scores and clinic pathological features based on the six lncRNA risk signature.
  f The Kaplan–Meier curves of OS in the high-risk and the low-risk groups stratified
  by the hypoxia-related lncRNA signature in the cohorts. g The ROC analysis of OS
  for the signature and the clinicopathologic parameters. h The nomogram for predicting
  proportion of patients with 1-, 3‐ or 5‐year OS
