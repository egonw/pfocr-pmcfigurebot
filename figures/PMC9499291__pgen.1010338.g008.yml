figure_title: The pathway of ADF7-inhibited-VLN1 is involved in osmotic-induced F-actin
  depolymerization and ROS accumulation
caption: (A) Confocal microscopy images of epidermal cells visualized by the expression
  of fABD2::GFP in root apices from Col-0 seedlings under mannitol treatments (200
  mM) for 0, 3, 6, and 9 h. Scale bar, 20 μm. (B) Violin plot showing the average
  and contribution of fluorescence intensity of actin cables in different genotypes
  seedlings under 200 mM mannitol treatments for different times. The red line represents
  the average fluorescence intensity in different genotypes. (C) Histogram depicting
  skewness of F-actin in (B). (D) Histogram depicting the percentage of occupancy
  of F-actin in (B). (E) ROS production in the roots of Col-0 seedlings under mannitol
  treatments (200 mM) for 0, 3, 6, and 9 h. Scale bar, 100 μm. (F) Histogram depicting
  relative fluorescence intensities of the ROS levels in (E). (G) Working model of
  ADF7 and VLN1 in root hair formation and in response to osmotic stress in Arabidopsis.
  Arrows represent positive regulation, and bar ends mean inhibitory action. Osmotic
  stress induces ADF7 expression, which leading to the inclined F-actin depolymerization
  and the inhibited VLN1 expression that decreases F-actin bundle. The cooperation
  of ADF7 and VLN1 results in the increased F-actin depolymerization, finer F-actin
  and F-actin turnover, which associated with the increase ROS level and root hair
  formation in osmotic stress, then enhancing plant osmotic stress tolerance. At least
  30 seedlings were examined for each genotype in different treatments. Significant
  difference (P< 0.05) indicated by different letters among genotypes is determined
  for each condition by one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s test in (B), (C), (D),
  and (F).
