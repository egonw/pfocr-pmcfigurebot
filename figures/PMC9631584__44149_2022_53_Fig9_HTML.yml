caption: Regulation of induced immune genes expression in human brain microvascular
  endothelial cells (hBMECs) following influenza A virus infection. a Canonical pathway
  of the “Interferon signaling” for the genes differentially expressed in hBMECs 12
  hpi, genes that are significantly up-regulated are shown in red. The intensity of
  red corresponds to an increase in fold change levels of the cells infected with
  A/WSN/33 (H1N1) compared to the control cells z-score = 4.2. White nodes specify
  genes with no significant gene expression at 12 hpi. The pathway was generated with
  IPA (Ingenuity pathways system). b quantification of gene expression by (RT-qPCR)
  for IFN-λ 2/3 (c) ISG15, and d IFN-β. (b-d) the hBMECs were infected with A/WSN/33
  (H1N1) at MOI 0.1, and the target genes were quantified by relative quantification
  qPCR. statistical-significance analyzed by t-test * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and ****
  p < 0.0001. e Mechanistic network by IPA for the upstream regulators interacting
  with IFN-β, which enables to discover plausible sets of connected upstream regulators
  that can work together to elicit the gene expression changes observed in our dataset
