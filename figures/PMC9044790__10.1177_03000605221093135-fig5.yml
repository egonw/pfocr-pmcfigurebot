caption: DEPDC1-AS1 interacts with HuR. (a) RNA–protein interaction prediction between
  DEPDC1-AS1 and HuR. An interaction score > 0.5 was considered positive. (b) Western
  blot analysis of RNA–protein complexes using an anti-HuR antibody. Experiments were
  repeated twice. (c) RIP experiments of DEPDC1-AS1 binding to HuR in HGC-27 cell
  lysates. The relative DEPDC1-AS1 level in HuR RIP is relative to its control IgG.
  n = 3 for each group. (d) RT-qPCR analysis of the relative mRNA expression of F11R
  after DEPDC1-AS1 or HuR knockdown in HGC-27 cells. n = 3 for each group. (e) The
  fold enrichment of F11R in HuR RIP after DEPDC1-AS1 knockdown in HGC-27 cells. The
  relative DEPDC1-AS1 level in HuR RIP is relative to its control IgG. n = 3 for each
  group. (f) Correlation between DEPDC1-AS1 and F11R expression. *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001.DEPDC1
  antisense RNA 1, DEPDC1-AS1; HuR, human antigen R; RT-qPCR, quantitative reverse
  transcription polymerase chain reaction.
