caption: Effects of various formulations of miR-125 (100 nM) and/or Afa (300 nM) for
  24 h on the pathways of glutaminolysis and fatty acid metabolism in AGS cells. (A)
  Scheme of glutaminolysis and fatty acid metabolism. (B) Measurement of relative
  glutamate levels by using a multifunctional microplate reader (statistical significance
  at * p < 0.05; *** p < 0.001). (C) (Left) Effect of various formulations of Afa
  and/or miR-125 on the expression of glutaminolysis pathway. (Right) Quantification
  of relative protein levels of glutaminolysis pathway. (D) (Left) Measurement of
  lipid accumulation by measuring a fluorescent lipid probe (4,4-Difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-Pentamethyl-4-Bora-3a,4a-Diaza-s-Indacene;
  BODIPY™; 100 mM) using a flow cytometer (statistical significance at *** p < 0.001).
  (Right) Histogram plots of fluorescence distribution of BODIPY™ after various treatments
  in AGS cells. (E) (Left) Effect of various formulations on protein expression in
  the pathway of fatty acid metabolism. (Right) Quantification of relative protein
  levels of fatty acid metabolism pathway. (C,E) * p < 0.05 compared with CTR, † p
  < 0.05 compared with miR-125/SLN-KL, ‡ p < 0.05 compared with Afa, ¶ p < 0.05 compared
  with Afa/SLN, and § p < 0.05 compared with Afa/SLN-KL via Student’s t-test analysis.
