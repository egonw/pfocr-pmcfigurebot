caption: 'Activation of apoptosis and necroptosis mediated by IFN in MAP-infected
  macrophages. (a) Necroptosis pathway (https://www.genome.jp/pathway/bta04217, accessed
  on 29 June 2023). Necroptosis can be initiated by different stimuli, such as tumor
  necrosis factor (TNF), TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), Fas ligand
  (FasL), interferon (IFN), LPS, viral DNA or RNA, and DNA damage agent, requiring
  the kinase activity of receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIPK1) and RIPK3. Its execution
  involves ROS generation, calcium overload, the opening of the mitochondrial permeability
  transition pore, mitochondrial fission, inflammatory response, and chromatinolysis.
  Candidate genes identified in our study that are involved in the necroptosis pathway
  are highlighted in orange: cPLA2—phospholipase 2, ANT—solute carrier family 25 (mitochondrial
  adenine nucleotide translocator) member 4/5/6/31, JNK—mitogen-activated protein
  kinase 9 (c-Jun N-terminal kinase), and TRAF5—TNF receptor-associated factor 5.
  (b) Recognition of MAP by Toll-like receptors (TLR) leads to polyubiquitination
  of TRAF3 (TNF-receptor associated factor 3), which activates IFN regulatory factor
  3 (IRF3). The activated IRF3 enters the nucleus and promotes IFNI/III expression
  and release. Secreted IFNI/III then interacts with their specific receptors. Signal
  transducer and activator of transcription (STAT1/STAT2) heterodimers binds to enhancer
  elements which results in the production of proinflammatory and apoptotic factors
  such as nitric oxide (NO) and caspases 4 and 8. Since MAP blocks apoptosis, an increase
  in IFNɣ production might trigger necroptosis. (c) Cells dying by necroptosis show
  a necrotic phenotype, including swelling, membrane rupture, and MAP release. Created
