figure_title: Elp3 induction by IL‐4 through multiple signaling pathways
caption: AIL‐4 and IL‐13 induce the expression of tRNA‐modifying enzymes in macrophages.
  Peritoneal macrophages were untreated (« Control ») or stimulated with IL‐4 (10 ng/ml),
  IL‐13 (10 ng/ml) or with both cytokines for 24 h and cell extracts from the resulting
  cells were subjected to WB analyses.BThe pool of thiolated tRNAs in macrophages
  is enhanced by IL‐4/IL‐13 but decreased by LPS/IFNγ. On the left, Northern blot
  analysis assessing t:Q(UUG) tRNA thiolation in Thioglycollate‐elicited peritoneal
  macrophages subjected to the indicated treatments for 24 h. On the right, quantification
  of t:Q(UUG) tRNA thiolation, calculated as the ration of thiolated over nonthiolated
  t:Q(UUG), in the indicated experimental conditions.CElp3 induction by IL‐4/IL‐13
  occurs through a PI3K‐dependent pathway. Peritoneal macrophages were pretreated
  with DMSO (control vehicle) or with Wortmannin (200 nM) for 1 h and subsequently
  left untreated or stimulated with IL‐4 (10 ng/ml)/IL‐13 (10 ng/ml) for the indicated
  periods of time. Cell extracts from the resulting cells were subjected to WB analyses.DPI3K
  inhibition does not impact on Elp3 mRNA levels. Peritoneal macrophages were pretreated
  with DMSO (control vehicle) or with Wortmannin (200 nM) for 1 h and subsequently
  left untreated or stimulated with IL‐4 (10 ng/ml) for 24 h. Elp3 mRNA levels were
  quantified in all experimental conditions by Real‐Time PCR. Elp3 mRNA levels in
  unstimulated cells were set to 1 and levels in other experimental conditions were
  relative to that after normalization with Gapdh mRNA levels. Experiments were conducted
  in triplicates (mean ± SD, Student t‐test, **P < 0.01).ERictor but not Raptor deficiency
  impairs Elp3 expression. BMDMs were transfected with the indicated siRNAs and the
  resulting cells were treated or not with IL‐4 (10 ng/ml)/IL‐13 (10 ng/ml) for 24 h.
  Cell extracts were subjected to WB analyses.FIL‐4/IL‐13 rely on Stat6 to induce
  Elp3 expression. Peritoneal macrophages were pretreated with the control vehicle
  (DMSO) or with the Stat6 pharmacological inhibitor AS1517499 (5 μM) for 1 h and
  subsequently left unstimulated or treated with IL‐4 (10 ng/ml)/IL‐13 (10 ng/ml)
  for the indicated periods of time. Cell extracts from the resulting cells were subjected
  to WB analyses.GStat6 is recruited on the Elp3 promoter in an IL‐4‐dependent manner.
  ChIP assays using an anti‐Stat6 antibody were conducted in RAW 264.7 cells to assess
  Stat6 recruitment on a Stat‐DNA binding site found in the Elp3 promoter. IgG antibody
  was used as a negative result. The histogram shows Stat6 recruitment on the Stat
  DNA‐binding site with or without IL‐4 (10 ng/ml) treatment for 2 h. Results obtained
  with four independent experiments (mean ± SD, Student t‐test, *P < 0.05) are illustrated.H–J
  Elp3 deficiency in myeloid cells impairs multiple signaling pathways triggered by
  IL‐4 (H, I, and J), IL‐13 (H) or by both cytokines (H). Peritoneal macrophages isolated
  from the indicated mouse genotypes were untreated or stimulated with IL‐4 (10 ng/ml)
  (H, I, and J), IL‐13 (10 ng/ml) (H) or with both cytokines (H) for 8 h (H) or for
  the indicated periods of time (I and J) and the resulting cell extracts were subjected
  to WB analyses.K Elp3 deficiency in BMDMs impairs the production of M2 markers upon
  stimulation with IL‐4/IL‐13. mRNAs of M2 markers were assessed by Real Time PCR.
  mRNA levels in unstimulated macrophages from Elp3 Control mice were set to 1 and
  levels in other experimental conditions were relative to that after normalization
  with Gapdh mRNA levels (n = 4 mice; mean ± SD, Student t‐test, *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001).LElp3
  promotes M2 macrophage polarization. Peritoneal macrophages isolated from the indicated
  mouse genotypes were untreated or stimulated with IL‐4/IL‐13 (10 ng/ml) for 24 h
  and the resulting cell extracts were subjected to WB analyses.  Source data are
  available online for this figure.
