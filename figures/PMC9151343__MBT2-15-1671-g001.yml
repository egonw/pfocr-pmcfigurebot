caption: 'Central metabolic pathways of V. natriegens. Enzymatic reactions (shown
  in blue boxes) are indicated as annotated in the KEGG database. Redox and energetic
  co‐factors of the reactions are highlighted in orange and green respectively. Prominent
  products of mixed acid fermentation are boxed. Colour coding: glycolysis, grey;
  acetate pathway, ochre; pyruvate‐derived fermentation products, red; TCA cycle,
  blue; glyoxylate pathway, turquoise and anaplerotic reactions, purple. Multiple
  enzymatic steps are indicated by a dashed line. Inactivated enzymes are framed in
  red. Abbreviations for metabolites: AC – acetate, AC‐CoA – acetyl‐coenzyme A, ACN
  – aconitate, AC‐P – acetylphosphate, aKG – α‐ketoglutarate, ALA – alanine, 1,3‐BPG
  – 1,3‐bisphosphoglycerate, CIT – citrate, DHAP – dihydroxyacetone phosphate, FOR
  – formate, FRC‐1,6‐BP – fructose‐1,6‐bisphosphate, FUM – fumarate, GLC – glucose,
  GLC‐6P ‐ glucose‐6‐phosphate, GLX – glyoxylate, ICT – isocitrate, LAC – lactate,
  MAL – malate, OAA – oxaloacetate, PEP – phosphoenolpyruvate, PYR – pyruvate, Qox/red
  – quinone/quinol, SUCC – succinate and SUCC‐CoA – succinyl‐coenzyme A; Abbreviations
