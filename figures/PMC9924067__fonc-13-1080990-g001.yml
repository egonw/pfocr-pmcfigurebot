caption: Mechanism of action of agents targeting HER2. Trastuzumab (green) binds to
  the ECD IV of HER2, thereby inhibiting the HER2 signaling pathway leading to cell
  cycle arrest; Pertuzumab (orange), which binds to the ECD II and Inhibits dimer
  formation; Margetuximab, which binds trastuzumab to an altered Fc-γ domain that
  involved in ADCC; Lapatinib (yellow) directly prevents the PI3K pathway from being
  activated by binding to the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of HER2; T-DM1
  (red circle)releases the emtansine moiety after the ADC is phagocytosed by lysosomes;
  T-Dxd (orange triangle), another ADC combining trastuzumab and deruxtecan, a potent
  topoisomerase I inhibitor; Bispecific antibody ZW25 (purple) binds to both extracellular
  domains II and IV of HER-2.
