caption: CXCL17 deletion suppresses the IL-17 signaling pathway. A. RT-qPCR was used
  to detect the mRNA levels of FOSB and MMP1, which were enriched in the IL-17 signaling
  pathway; B. representative result of western blotting analysis for the protein levels
  of key effectors in IL-17 signaling pathway. Column diagrams were performed to account
  the relative protein levels in the right bottom panel. Compared with siNC group,
  **P < 0.01.
