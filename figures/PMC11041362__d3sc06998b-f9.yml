figure_title: (a) TOFRu values over the as-synthesized catalysts at 400 °C and 1 MPa.
  (b) The proposed N2 activation pathway over Co1Ru SAA and CoRu NPA. (c) Top views
  of free Re1 and Re2 centers over Co(0001). (d) Comparison of the volcano plot of
  TOF for dimer alloys and SAAs as a function of *N–N transition state energies. The
  TOF is calculated at 673 K, PN2 = 24.5 bar, PH2 = 74.25 bar, PNH3 = 1 bar, and 2%
  conversion to NH3. TOFs of Mo2/Au, Ru2/Au, and Re2/Au dimer alloys are calculated
  using the DFT results reported in ref.
