caption: 'Intracellular flow cytometry confirms AML patients display enhanced O-GlcNAcylation
  and OGT expression. (A) O-GlcNAc staining of OCI-AML3 cells by flow cytometry with
  vehicle control, Thiamet G (25 μM), or OSMI-1 (25 μM). n = 8 (B) Intracellular O-GlcNAc
  levels from healthy donor derived PBMCs (Healthy PBMCs, n = 6) and CD34+CD38+ AML
  cells from PBMCs or BM-MNCs (AML, n = 12). (C, D) O-GlcNAc levels (C) and OGT protein
  expression (D) in BM-MNCs isolated from healthy donors (n = 5) or AML patients (n
  = 5). HSPC: CD34+ from healthy donor, LSCs: CD34+CD38dim, AML Blasts: CD34+CD38+.
  (A–D) Representative histograms are shown on the right. Statistical analysis was
  done using a one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test (A, C, D) or
  a Student’s t-test (B). *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.005; ****, P < 0.0001. (B–D) FMO
  – Fluorescence minus one controls.'
