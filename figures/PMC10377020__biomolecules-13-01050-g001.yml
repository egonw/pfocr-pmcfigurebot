caption: Endoplasmic reticulum stress and the adaptive UPR signaling pathway. Excessive
  accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER activates the IRE1α-XBP1,
  PERK-eIF2α, PERK-NRF2, and ATF6 signaling pathways by binding to BiP, thereby promoting
  the expression of chaperones, the synthesis of ER and Golgi structural components,
  and the ERAD pathway to improve protein folding and reduce cellular damage from
  stress.
