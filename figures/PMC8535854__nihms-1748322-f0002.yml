figure_title: Metabolic changes allow cancer cells to survive in circulation and promote
  colonization of distant organs
caption: After successful intravasation, cancer cells face drastic changes such as
  an increase in oxygen availability and high levels of ROS. To cope with this, cancer
  cells reprogram their metabolism towards OXPHOS and activate cellular mechanisms
  leading to regeneration of NADPH and induction of antioxidant systems. These include
  overexpression of the rate-limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP),
  G6PD, as well as the folate cycle, enzymes ALDH1L2 and MTHFD1, while suppressing
  the NADPH-consuming enzyme MTHFR. Further, CTCs increase the consumption of glutamine
  and cysteine to increase the synthesis of glutathione (GSH) along with other antioxidants.
  Activation of non-canonical antioxidants such as β-globin (HBB) and transferrin
  also attenuate reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Following survival in the
  circulation, cancer cells eventually colonize distant organs. Different cancer cell
  types display distinct organotropism. Similar to the CTCs, cancer cells metastasizing
  to the lungs and brain face high levels of oxidative stress. To eliminate ROS, cancer
  cells activate PGC-1α and stimulate the expression of antioxidant enzymes GPx1 and
  SOD2. Colonization of the lung also heavily relies on activation of PC and pyruvate
  metabolism, which are crucial for collagen-based remodeling of the ECM in the lung
  microenvironment via P4HA. On the other hand, cancer cells metastasizing to the
  brain can reprogram their metabolism to utilize non-canonical fuels such as acetate
  and glutamine as well as the ability to perform de novo serine synthesis to cope
  with the specific nutritional needs of the brain. Serine synthesis is also important
  for cancer cells metastasizing to the bones, which in addition to PHDGH overexpress
  PSPH. These cells also express calcium-sensitive receptors on their surface and
  activate glycolysis and lactate production. Cancer cells metastasizing to the liver
  upregulate ALDOB3 to switch to fructose metabolism which together with PDK-1 support
  the Warburg effect.
