caption: S-acylation in the proximal TCR signaling pathway. An antigen peptide, bound
  to an MHC of an antigen presenting cell (APC), engages and stimulates the TCR while
  its co-receptor (CD4/CD8) binds to the MHC, resulting in the activation of several
  signaling cascades, subsequently leading to T cell activation. Upon TCR stimulation,
  PAG/Cbp is de-phosphorylated, and disassociates from Csk, allowing for the recruitment
  of Lck to the TCR. Lck is then activated, and phosphorylates the ITAMs of the TCR-associated
  CD3 and ζ-chains. These phosphorylated ITAMs then act as a docking site for ZAP-70,
  which is then phosphorylated by Lck. ZAP-70 then phosphorylates and activates the
  scaffolding protein LAT, which is a docking site for several proteins, including
  SLP-76, PLC-γ1, and GRB2. These are then able to be phosphorylated and activated,
  many by ZAP-70. The activation of PLC-γ1 leads to the formation of IP3 and DAG from
  PIP2. IP3 then binds to the IP3R on the ER membrane, leading to the depletion of
  the ER Ca2+ stores. This activates STIM1, which then binds to Orai1 at ER-PM junctions,
  forming an activated CRAC channel, and allowing for Ca2+entry into the cell (shown
  as red dots). This then leads to the activation of the NFAT pathway. DAG activates
  both the NFκB pathway and the Ras pathway. These pathways result in the activation
  of transcription factors, ultimately leading to gene expression and T cell activation.
  Proteins in red are reported to be S-acylated. APC- antigen presenting cell; TCR-
  T cell receptor; MHC- major histocompatibility complex; ITAMs-immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
  activation motifs. Created with BioRender.com.
