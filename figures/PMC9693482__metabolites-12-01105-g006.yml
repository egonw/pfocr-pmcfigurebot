caption: Differentially expressed lipids between the CP and CK groups. Heatmaps of
  the top 25 differential amniotic fluid lipids in the (A) positive and (B) negative
  ion modes (n = 6). Each square corresponds to the peak intensity of lipids. Red
  or blue squares represent increases or decreases in concentration. Dark red or blue
  squares stand for higher increase or decrease degrees of concentration. (C) ChemRICH
  enrichment analysis of differential lipids (n = 6). Each node represents a cluster
  of differential lipids. Node sizes represent the total number of lipids in each
  cluster. Red or blue nodes stand for the clusters with most lipids upregulated or
  downregulated. Deep pink nodes include both upregulated and downregulated lipids.
  (D) Metabolic pathway network of differential lipids. The rectangle represents saturated
  lipids, the circle represents unsaturated lipids, the thick black border represents
  oxidized lipids, the blue color represents downregulation, the red color represents
  upregulation, and the gray triangle represents undetected or not significant lipids.
