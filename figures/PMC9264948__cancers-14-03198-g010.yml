caption: Proposed cellular mechanism of action of PYR. The illustration depicts the
  proposed mechanism of PYR in cancer cells, modulating cellular pathways to induce
  growth inhibition and apoptosis in glioma cells. PYR is an acridine derivative,
  which intercalates DNA and impairs DNA repair pathways. PYR-induced DNA damage promotes
  activation of p53-mediated cell cycle arrest. In addition, PYR inhibits Topoisomerase
  II and induces mitochondrial depolarization thereby initiating caspase 3 and 9 mediated
  intrinsic apoptosis pathways. PYR induces tumor suppressor protein—Par-4 through
  inhibition of nuclear localization of p65, NF-κB, BCl-2 and activating pro-apoptotic
  pathway proteins BAX. PYR increases oxidative stress after DNA damage and decreases
  MMP. PYR upregulates the production of p53, capase3/9, Bax, and Cyto-C and downregulates
  the production of Bcl-2, promoting the release of Cyto-C, increasing caspase-3/7
  activities, and potentiating apoptosis in glioma cells. Bax, Bcl-2-associated X
  protein; Bcl-2—B-cell lymphoma 2; Cyto C—cytochrome c.
