caption: 'Gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and
  disease ontology (DO) analyses of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between
  osteoarthritis (OA) and normal controls. a) Bubble plot showing the top ten GO terms,
  including four biological processes, two cell components, and four molecular functions.
  b) KEGG pathway analysis of DEGs between OA and normal controls: the bubble plot
  shows the top ten enriched KEGG pathways of DEGs. c) Bar plot showing the DO enrichment
  analysis, where the horizontal axis represents the number of DEGs under the DO terms.
  IL-17, interleukin 17; NF-kappa B, nuclear factor kappa B; TNF, tumour necrosis
  factor.'
