caption: 'Pharmacological inhibition of CBS with AOAA attenuates the DS-associated
  down-regulation of autophagy-related (Atg) components for the formation and maturation
  of the autophagosome. (A): schematic summary of the pathways involved; (B): representative
  Western blots; (C): Quantification of the protein expression of ATG7, phosphorylated
  beclin-1 (pBeclin-1) at Ser15, ATG3, and the lipidated, autophagosome-associated
  LC3-II. β-Actin served as loading control for densitometry. Each bar graph represents
  the mean ± SEM of n = 8 human euploid control fibroblasts and n = 8 DS fibroblasts.
  C1–C8 and D1-D8 corresponds to the specific donors listed in . Dotted connecting
  lines in the bar graphs indicate the same cell from a specific donor with/without
  AOAA treatment. *p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01 DSC indicates significant differences between
  DSC untreated vs. CC untreated; #p ≤ 0.05, ##p ≤ 0.01 indicates significant differences
  between DSC + AOAA vs. DSC untreated.'
