figure_title: Depletion of ESCRT-I induces the expression of genes annotated to autophagy
  and cholesterol biosynthesis
caption: '(A) Gene ontology (GO) analysis of top biological processes identified by
  annotation of genes with up-regulated expression (≥1.5-fold; adjusted P-value <
  0.05), detected by RNA-Seq in RKO cells depleted of Tsg101 or Vps28 (siTsg101#1
  or #2, siVps28#1 or #2), as compared to control cells (treated with nontargeting
  siRNAs, Ctrl#1 or #2). RNA-Seq data analysis was performed based on three independent
  experiments. (B) Heatmap visualizing expression of genes annotated to “autophagy”
  (GO:0006914) process, whose mRNA levels were detected by RNA-Seq as up-regulated
  after Tsg101 or Vps28 depletion in RKO cells. Established MiT-TFE target genes are
  indicated by asterisks. (C) Heatmap visualizing expression of genes annotated to
  “cholesterol metabolic processes” (GO:0008203) process, whose mRNA levels were detected
  by RNA-Seq as up-regulated after Tsg101 or Vps28 depletion in RKO cells. Established
  cholesterol biosynthesis genes are indicated by asterisks.'
