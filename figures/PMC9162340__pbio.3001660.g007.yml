caption: '(A, B) Punt-GFP and Wit-GFP displayed basolateral restriction in the larval
  salivary gland epithelium. Confocal sections through the center of the salivary
  gland show cell polarity pointing exterior (basal) to interior (apical) with a central
  lumen (aPKC). Red arrows point to gap in GFP fluorescence signal at the SJ (A′,
  B′). (C, D) Punt-GFP and Wit-GFP showed general membrane presentation in the follicle
  cell epithelium in the ovary. Arrows point to unambiguous GFP signal at the apical
  surface (C′, D′). (E–H) Screening for apicalization of Punt-GFP in RNAi clones for
  trafficking factors. Clones are marked in red in whole disc confocal image and double-prime
  insets. GFP IF signal is shown in isolation in single-prime insets. Asterisks in
  the red channel point to example RNAi clones (E′′–H′′). Green arrows point toward
  the apical surface and mark ectopic apical staining in RNAi clones relative to neighboring
  WT cells (E′, F′). White arrowheads point toward the apical membrane for conditions
  where the apical level of Punt-GFP did not change between RNAi clones and control
  cells (G′, H′). Punt-GFP is observed at the apical membrane near marked clones with
  RNAi knockdown of AP-1/2β (E) or AP-1γ (F). No such apical staining was observed
  in clones with RNAi knockdown for AP-2 components such as AP-2μ (G) or for Rab5
  (H). (I–J) Western blot detection of Punt[Punt] and Punt[Wit]. Samples were collected
  from nub-GAL4 driving the indicated Punt construct. “ant” is anterior half of the
  larvae, including discs, and “WD” is specific dissection of Wing Discs. The HA epitope
  near the N-terminus did not detect significant specific degradation products (I).
  Detection of the Punt antibody epitope near the carboxyl terminus also did not reveal
  any significant specific bands that would suggest clipping (J). Mobility markers
  are indicated by kDa labels, arrows indicate expected position of Punt, and asterisks
  mark background bands not attributed to specific Punt detection. Punt[Wit] level
  was not increased with either antibody (I, J). (K) AP-1γ knockdown leads to a reduction
  in basolateral Punt. A single confocal plane through the lateral portion of the
  columnar cells of the wing pouch with AP-1γ RNAi clones marked in red (K). Multiple
  areas with reduced Punt-GFP staining near the center of the pouch correspond to
  the RNAi clones (K′). The streaks of increased Punt-GFP staining in panels K and
  K′ correspond to the apical sides of RNAi clones. Scale bars: 100 μm for A, B, E,
  F, G, H; 50 μm for K, K′; 25 μm for C, D; 15 μm for E′–G′, E′′–G′′. See  for a summary
  of the data supporting the sorting model. AP, adaptor protein; RNAi, RNA interference;
  WT, wild-type.'
