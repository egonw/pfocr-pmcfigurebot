caption: Myricetin effects on the morphological change in the AGSgastric cancer cell.
  The AGS gastric cancer cells were treated with myricetin (0, 15, and 25 μM) for
  24 h. (A) Morphological changes, particularly autophagy vacuoles, were observed
  under a fluorescence microscope. (B) The AGSgastric cancer cells were stained with
  acridine orange to detect acidic vesicular organelles (AVOs) and analyzed using
  a fluorescence microscope. The cytoplasm and the nucleus stained fluorescent green,
  and the AVOs stained fluorescent red (scale bar, 10 μm).
