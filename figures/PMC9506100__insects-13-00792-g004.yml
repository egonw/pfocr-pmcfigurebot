caption: Transcriptional characteristics of immune-related genes induced by E. japonica
  parasitism. (A) The relative expression levels of cellular-immunity-related genes.
  (B) The relative expression levels of AMP genes. (C) The relative expression levels
  of Toll, IMD pathway genes and JAK/STAT pathway genes. All transcriptional levels
  were normalized to the expression level of Rp49. The statistical significance is
  indicated by * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 or *** p < 0.001. The results are shown as
  the mean Â± S.D.
