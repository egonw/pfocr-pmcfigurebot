caption: Scheme of metabolic functions, induced by RTG pathway in U cells (A) and
  L cells (B). Proteins, the level of which increased upon Rtg protein activation,
  are in green, and related pathways in red. MOM, mitochondrial outer membrane; MIM,
  mitochondrial inner membrane; MT, mitochondria; PX, peroxisome; TCA, TCA cycle;
  GC, glyoxylate cycle; Ox-Ac, oxaloacetate; α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; PHP, 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate;
  3PGA, 3-phosphoglycerate; D-2HG, D-2-hydroxyglutarate; MG, methylglyoxal; DHAP,
  dihydroxyacetone phosphate and GA3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Reaction 1—predicted
  function of Dld3p in D-2HG metabolism; reaction 2—predicted function of Dld3p in
  MG metabolism.
