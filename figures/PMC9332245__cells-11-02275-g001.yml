caption: 'Model of the war between host and FHB-related pathogen. There are two ways
  of infecting plants with FHB-related pathogen. Pathway I: Pore invasion, in which
  the mycelium invades the plant directly through the natural pores present in the
  plant, such as stomata, the opening of the apical floret, and the gap between the
  palea and the outer glume. Pathway II: Cell wall invasion, where the pathogenic
  mycelium invades the plant directly or expands within the cells by destroying and
  degrading the cell surface cuticle and the cell wall. ❶ The fungus hydrolyzes the
  plant cuticle by synthesizing some hydrolytic enzymes (e.g., keratinase) and repairs
  its own cell membrane and cell wall by synthesizing chitin synthase, sphingolipids,
  and glucosylceramide synthase to counteract the defensive damage from the plant,
  while the plant reinforces the physical barrier formed by the cuticle and cell wall
  by synthesizing lignin, wax lipids, and pectin. Meanwhile, the plant also synthesizes
  chitinases, tylopectinase, and glucanase to degrade the fungal cell wall and synthesizes
  thionins, non-specific lipid transfer proteins, puroindolines, and ROS to disrupt
  and damage the fungal membrane integrity, finally counteracting the fungal invasion.
  ❷ The plant has stronger resistance, and the physical barrier can prevent the expansion
  of the pathogenic mycelium and shows a state of tolerance to the invading pathogen.
  ❷ The pathogenic mycelium breaks through the physical barrier of the plant and infests
  the adjacent cells. At this point, the plant will secrete some phytotoxins (e.g.,
  isohydroxamate phenols) and/or synthesize phenols and bacteriostatic proteins to
  further inhibit the growth of the mycelium and synthesize polygalacturonase and
  xylanase to inhibit the degradation of its own cell wall. The pathogen further synthesizes
  pectinases, hemicellulases, cellulases, lipases, and nucleases to damage plant cell
  membranes and cell walls. ❸ The invasion of the pathogen promotes the expression
  of some resistance proteins from the plant to inhibit the development of the mycelium
  and the production of toxins, and the plant behaves as a tolerant. ❸ Under pathogen
  stimulation, plant cells elevate the level of ROS and polyamines, which promote
  oxidative damage in fungal cells. On the other hand, when ROS accumulation in plant
  cells reaches a certain level, this will trigger the expression of oxidases, such
  as peroxidase (APX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT), to scavenge
  ROS and reduce oxidative damage for themselves and inhibit intracellular toxin accumulation.
  ❹ At later stages, the pathogen spreads wildly and triggers a strong ROS production,
  which, in turn, promotes disease spread and toxin accumulation and then results
  in programmed cell death in the plant.'
