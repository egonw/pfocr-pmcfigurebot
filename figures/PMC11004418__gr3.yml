caption: CD133-containing MVs induce angiogenesis through the p38 MAPK signaling pathway.
  (A) EA.hy926 cells were treated with shMock and shCD133 MVs for 16 h. Protein level
  was determined using western blotting. p-p38, phosphorylated p38; pAKT, phosphorylated
  AKT; pERK, phosphorylated ERK. Full-length blot images are shown in  (B) Quantification
  of the p-p38 level. (C) EA.hy926 cells were pre-treated with SB203580 (20 μM) for
  2 h and treated with shMock MVs in the presence of SB203580 for 13 h. Representative
  images of tube formation were shown. Scale bar = 100 μm. (D) Meshes and tubes were
  measured from five random fields in each well. Mean ± SEM of n = 3 independent experiments.
  All p values were obtained using an unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test. *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
