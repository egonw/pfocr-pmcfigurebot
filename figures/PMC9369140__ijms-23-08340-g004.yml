caption: Transcriptome analysis of gene expressions involved in carotenoid biosynthesis-related
  pathways in the striped leaves of B03S. (A) Heatmap analysis of gene expressions
  in carotenoid pathways. (B) Metabolite and enzyme in four processes of carotenoid
  metabolic pathway. Data are normalized and transformed by log2FC of gene expression
  in zebra-green striped leaves compared to those in zebra-yellow striped leaves (n
  = 3). FC, fold change; Z-G, zebra-green striped in leaves/alternate green leaves;
  Z-Y, zebra-yellow striped in leaves/alternate yellow leaves.
