caption: Promising targets for lung cancer. (A) KRAS mutation-related genes are promising
  targets for silencing since they lead to TKI resistance defeating the use of EGFR-TKI.
  (B) Akt1 onco-protein is one of the isoforms of serine-threonine kinase Akt protein
  which is activated in phosphoinositide 2-kinase (P13K-AkT) pathway. P13K-AKT pathway
  plays a significant role in cancer cell proliferation because when it is activated
  in cancer cells it enhances the nutrient uptake promoting cell growth. Hence, Akt1
  is a favorable target for inhibiting cancer cell proliferation. (C) Transcription
  factors activated by inflammatory pathways coordinate production of cytokines or
  chemokines such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α),
  interleukins and interferons to recruit and activate immune cells in cancerous cells.
  After that, cytokines activate the same transcription factors in recruited immune
  cells. As a result, immune system is constantly being activated leading to chronic
  inflammation that promotes tumor growth. Also, immunosuppressive behaviors of regulatory
  T cells (Tregs), MDSCs and TAMs further progression of cancer. (D) Metastasis is
  a complex process that has several stages such as angiogenesis that leads to primary
  tumor growth, intravasation which assists in traveling thorough the bloodstream,
  extravasation into distal tissue and metastatic growth. This process is inefficient
  and only a few cancerous cells survive this process therefore micro-environment
  interactions are essential to facilitate every stage of the process. Thus, the genes
  associated with these interactions are promising targets for decreasing lung metastasis
  potential. Image created using Biorender.com.
