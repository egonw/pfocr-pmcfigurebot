figure_title: Increased abundance of nucleotide metabolic intermediates through CPT1A-mediated
  FAO in NPC cells
caption: A GSEA plot correlating CPT1A mRNA levels with KEGG DNA replication and the
  pyrimidine metabolic pathway based on publicly available NPC patient gene-expression
  profiles (NCBI/GEO/GSE12452, n = 41). B Box diagram with fold changes in cellular
  purine metabolite levels in C666-1 cells compared with NP69 cells. Three replicates
  were tested for each cell line (**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001). C Box diagram with fold
  change of cellular pyrimidine metabolite levels in C666-1 cells compared with NP69
  cells. Three replicates were tested for each cell line (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).
  D Heatmap of metabolic flux depicting ratios of detected purine and pyrimidine nucleoside
  pathway-related metabolites in C666-1 knockdown CPT1A cell lines. Significantly
  altered intermediate metabolites are indicated in blue text (decreased) and red
  text (increased). E Labeling incorporation from 13C-palmitate into nucleobases in
  C666-1 cells stably transfected with CPT1A shRNA or control shRNA. Data are shown
  as percentage of 13C-adenine, 13C-guanine, 13C-cytosine, 13C-thymine, or 13C-uracil
  compared to the total pool of each corresponding nucleobase (*P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001).
  F Percentage M + 1 and M + 2 labeling from [U-13C] palmitate in cytidine in C666-1
  cells stably transfected with CPT1A shRNA or control shRNA (**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).
  G Percentage M + 1 labeling from [U-13C] palmitate in uridine in C666-1 cells stably
  transfected with CPT1A shRNA or control shRNA (*P < 0.05).
