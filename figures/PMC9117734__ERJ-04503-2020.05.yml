caption: 'Correlation analysis of the quantitative radiomic risk score (qRISSc) with
  molecular data in experimental interstitial lung disease (ILD). a) Score distribution
  across the three datasets, demonstrating a similar qRISSc distribution between mice
  of the bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis model (n=30) and systemic sclerosis-associated
  ILD (SSc-ILD) patients (Zurich, n=75; Oslo, n=66). b) Representative histological
  images of bleomycin-treated mice with low and high qRISSc that were stained for
  the myofibroblast marker α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), the pan-leukocyte marker
  CD45 and picrosirius red (PSR) to visualise collagen fibres (collagen=red). Sections
  of the entire right caudal lobe (scale bar: 1 mm) with higher magnification views
  (×100 magnification; scale bar: 100 μm) are shown. c) Correlation matrix for qRISSc
  with histological parameters (percentage of α-SMA and CD45 positivity, and Ashcroft
  score), and mRNA expression of inflammatory (Il6 and Mcp1) and fibrotic (Col1a1,
  Col3a1 and Fn1) genes. A lower change in cycle threshold (ΔCt) value and thus negative
  correlation indicates higher gene expression. Spearman correlation coefficient ρ
  is shown. Nonsignificant associations are depicted on a white background. d) Volcano
  plot for qRISSc-correlated proteins. Proteins with ρ≥|0.3| and p<0.05 are highlighted
  in red. e) Bar plot of the top 10 (based on p-value) Gene Ontology biological processes
  associated with qRISSc. f) Bar plot of the top 10 (based on p-value) Reactome pathways
  associated with qRISSc. g) Heat plot indicating the top enriched proteins per molecular
  pathway. For (e–g), the most important associations are highlighted in purple. For
  pathway analyses, only proteins with ρ≥|0.3| and p<0.05 were considered. ER: endoplasmic
  reticulum; hnRNP: heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein.'
