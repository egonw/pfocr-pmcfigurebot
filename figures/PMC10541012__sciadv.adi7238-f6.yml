figure_title: Cla4 and Cdh1 regulate gene transcription and chronological life span
  by affecting Set1 stability
caption: (A) ChIP-seq tracks of Set1, Cla4, and Paf1 occupancy at eight core histone
  genes. (B) RT-qPCR analysis of core histone gene transcription in WT, Set1-S228A,
  and Set1-S228E mutants. HHT2 encodes histone H3; HHF2 encodes histone H4; HTA2 encodes
  histone H2A; HTB2 encodes histone H2B. (C) Immunoblot analysis of core histones
  in WT, Set1-S228A, and Set1-S228E mutants. (D) Volcano plots for genes differentially
  expressed in WT and Set1-S228A mutant. Differential expression levels of aligned
  sequences were calculated using significant thresholds set at log2(FC) ≤ −0.75,
  log2(FC) ≥ 0.75, P < 0.05. Red color designates significantly down-regulated genes,
  and blue color designates significantly up-regulated genes. (E) Heatmap showing
  the transcription of eight core histone genes in WT and Set1-S228A mutant. (F) GSEA
  analysis of genes involved in cell cycle, DNA replication, and mismatch repair in
  WT and Set1-S228A mutant. (G) Box plots showing the normalized read intensity of
  H3K4me3 at subtelomeric regions on 16 chromosomes in WT, Set1-S228A, and Set1-S228E
  mutants. The subtelomeric regions refer to 0 to 50 kb from the nearest left or right
  telomeres. (H) RT-qPCR analysis of the transcription of telomere-proximal genes
  in WT, Set1-S228A, and Set1-S228E mutants. (I) Heatmap showing the transcription
  of the longevity pathway genes in WT and Set1-S228A mutant. (J) Chronological life-span
  analysis of WT, Set1-S228A, and Set1-S228E mutants. (K) Chronological life-span
  analysis of WT, cla4Δ, Set1-S228E, and Set1-S228E cla4Δ mutants. For (B), (C), (H),
  (J), and (K), data represent the mean ± SE of three biological independent experiments.
