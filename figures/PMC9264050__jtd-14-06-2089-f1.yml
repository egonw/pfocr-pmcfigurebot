caption: Serum and lung function indices and serum TNF-α, STAT3, and KL-6 expression
  levels before and after treatment. (A) Changes in FVC before and after treatment;
  (B) changes in FEV1 before and after treatment; (C) changes in FEV1/FVC before and
  after treatment; (D) changes in PEF before and after treatment; (E) changes in serum
  TNF-α levels before and after treatment; (F) changes in serum STAT3 levels before
  and after treatment; and (G) changes in serum KL-6 levels before and after treatment.
  FVC, forced vital capacity; FEV1, forced expiratory volume in one second; PEF, peak
  expiratory flow; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; STAT3, signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3; KL-6, Krebs Von den Lungen-6.
