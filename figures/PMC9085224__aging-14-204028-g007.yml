caption: Elevation of miR-181a-5p repressed ESCC cell migration, invasion and proliferation.
  ECA109 and KYSE-70 cells were transfected with miR-181a-5p mimic, inhibitor or negative
  control (NC) for 48 hours; (A, D) Transwell invasion assay exposed that miR-181a-5p
  mimic inhibited cell migration and invasion in Eca109 (A) and KYSE-70 cells (B)
  Wound healing assay exposed that miR-181a-5p mimic inhibited cell migration. Representative
  images were obtained at 0, 24 and 48 h. RT-qPCR analysis of wound area in Eca109
  (C) and KYSE-70 cells (D). The proliferation of ECA109 cells treated with miR-181a-5p
  mimic, inhibitor or negative control (NC) was measured by CCK8 assay in Eca109 (E)
  and KYSE-70 cells (F). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 miR-181a-5p mimics vs. NC group.
