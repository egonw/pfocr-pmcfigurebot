caption: KLF14 inhibited cervical cancer cell proliferation in vitro. A After transfection
  with Lv-KLF14, the Western blot results showed that the expression of KLF14 was
  significantly increased in SiHa and HeLa cells. B The colony formation assay verified
  that the colony formation rate of the Lv-KLF14 group was lower than that of the
  Lv-control group. C The CCK-8 assay demonstrated that the proliferation of the Lv-KLF14
  group was lower than that of the Lv-control group within 24 h. These results suggest
  that KLF14 has an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of cervical cancer SiHa
  cells and HeLa cells. (**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001)
