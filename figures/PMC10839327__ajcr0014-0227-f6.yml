caption: EIF4EBP1 gene expression is enriched in breast tumors compared to normal
  breast tissues and is expressed primarily in cancer epithelial cells. A. mRNA expression
  from 114 normal breast tissues is compared to 1090 breast cancer tumors from the
  TCGA database. B. Box plots of epithelial cells, fibroblasts, adipocytes, and endothelial
  cells based on the xCell algorithm for the TCGA, METABRIC, and SCAN-B cohorts. EIF4EBP1
  gene expression is dichotomized by the median. The bolded center bar within the
  boxplots represents the median, the lower and upper box bounds represent the 25th
  and 75th percentiles, respectively, and the lower and upper tails represent the
  minimum and maximum values, respectively. C. Single cell RNA sequencing results
  from cohort described in [], comprised of 26 tumors (11 ER+HER2-, 5 HER2+, and 10
  TNBC), with a total of 130,246 single cells (Left). Results from cohort described
  in [] comprised of 5 TNBC tumors, with a total of 24,271 single cells (Right). D.
  The dot plot shows the overall percentage of the total EIF4EBP1 gene expression
  by cell type and the average expression within each cell type for each cohort. Histogram/violin
  plot of EIF4EBP1 gene expression by epithelial cell subclass from cohort described
  in [].

  cell proliferation and is a biomarker for poor breast cancer prognosis.
