caption: Transcriptional response of optic nerve proper astrocytes to elevated IOP.
  A Principal component analysis based on expression levels of the top 2000 most variable
  genes across 7 vs 0, 30 vs 7 and 30 vs 0 day ONP samples. B Number of DEGs for each
  independent time point pairwise comparison. Significance was adjusted p-value < 0.05;
  no log2 fold change cutoff was applied. C Venn diagram showing the number of unique
  and overlapping DEGs across the 3 independent time point comparisons (adjusted p-value < 0.05).
  D Top 30 up and downregulated genes for each of the 3 independent time point comparisons,
  based on rank from largest to lowest log2 fold change value (absolute value, log2
  FC > 0 upregulated, log2 FC < 0 downregulated). E Up and downregulated pathways
  from the 7 vs 0 day sample. Based on over-representation analysis of the up and
  down regulated genes using the Reactome database. Listed are all pathways with adjusted
  p-value < 0.05. Each pathway is color matched for the broader category it belongs
  to. NES refers to the normalized enrichment score that accounts for differences
  in gene set size and in correlations between gene sets and the expression dataset.
  F Up and downregulated pathways from the 30 vs 7 day sample. Based on over-representation
  analysis of the up and down regulated genes using the Reactome database. Listed
  are all pathways with adjusted p-value < 0.05. Each pathway is color matched for
  the broader category it belongs to. G Up and downregulated pathways from the 30
  vs 0 day sample. Based on over-representation analysis of the up and down regulated
  genes using the Reactome database. Listed are all pathways with adjusted p-value < 0.05.
  Each pathway is color matched for the broader category it belongs to
