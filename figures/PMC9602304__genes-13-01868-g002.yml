caption: 'A schematic presentation of autophagy pathway and autophagomiRs. The induction
  of the pathway includes the inactivation of mTOR and the activation of ULK1 with
  the engulfment of the cargoes. Nucleation includes the activation of class III PI3K
  by ULK1, which is followed by the creation of the Beclin-1-PI3K complex. Afterward,
  the phagophoreâ€™s membrane is elongated and closed, forming the autophagosome, requiring
  two conjugations, which occur between LC3I-PE and ATG5-ATG12. Then follows the formation
  of the autophagolysosome, via the fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosome,
  and the (v) cargo degradation []. Some of the autophagomiRs that either suppress
  or induce autophagy pathway are demonstrated in the above scheme. This figure was
  created with BioRender.com (accessed on 9 October 2022) (Agreement number: AN24I5W81K).
  (LC3) microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; (mTOR) mammalian target of
  rapamycin; (PE) lipid phosphatidylethanolamine; (UKL1) Unc-51-like kinase1 complex.'
