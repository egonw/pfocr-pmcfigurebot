caption: Bubble plot of differential genes enrichment for G vs R cultivars. The top
  20 pathways with the smallest Q values were used to construct the graph. KEGG enrichment
  of DEGs among different roselle cultivars. The “X” axis shows the enrichment score;
  the “Y” axis shows the number of DEGs mapped to each KEGG pathway.
