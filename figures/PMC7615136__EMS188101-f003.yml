figure_title: Endothelial-AHR mediates lung protection via apelin signalling and prevents
  a dysplastic apoptotic response in airway epithelia
caption: a, c, Heatmaps showing differentially expressed genes in lung endothelia
  (a) or epithelia (c) comparing influenza infected WT and ECΔAhr mice. b, d, Selected
  canonical pathways differentially regulated between infected WT and ECΔAhr lung
  endothelial cells (b) and epithelial cells (d) using ingenuity pathway analysis
  (IPA) (padj < 0.05, fold change > 1.5). (e) Dot plot of hallmark pathways in ECΔAhr
  mice (relative to WT) using GSEA (four pairwise comparisons total). Dot size relates
  to statistical significance. (f) Frequency of apoptotic (Annexin-V+) and necrotic
  (TO-PRO-3+) lung endothelia (CD31+), progenitor airway epithelial cells (EpCamhighCD24lowMHC-II–),
  mature airway epithelia (EpCamhighCD24highMHC-II–), and type II alveolar epithelial
  cells (EpCamlowMHC-II+) was assessed by flow cytometry in influenza infected WT
  and ECΔAhr mice (n = 4). g, h, Apln and Aplnr expression was determined in total
  lung and lung endothelial cells isolated from influenza infected WT, ECΔAhr (g)
  and Cyp1–/– (h) (n = 3). i, j, Lung vascular leakage was determined in PBS (n =
  9) or apelin (n = 10) treated WT mice (i) and PBS or MM54-treated WT (PBS n = 16;
  MM54 n = 15) and Cyp1–/– (PBS n = 11; MM54 n = 10) mice (j) by quantification of
  total cell and RBCs. All Data are representative of two to three independent experiments
  with similar results or pooled from three experiments (j). Statistical analysis
  was performed using a one-sided Wald test with Benjamini–Hochberg correction (a-d),
  normalised enrichment scores (NES) were generated with GSEA using a two-sided Kolmogorov
  Smirnov statistic with Hallmark genesets on genelists ranked by the Wald t statistic
  from DESeq2 (e) unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test (f, i), or two-way ANOVA with
  Sidak’s post-test (g, h, j) and significant P values are indicated on the graphs.
  Data are shown as mean±SEM. ns, not significant.
