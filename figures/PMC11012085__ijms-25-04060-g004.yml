caption: Cyclin E1–CDK2 co-expression and bioinformatics. (A) Kaplan–Meier curve for
  cyclin E1 and CDK2 co-expression and progression-free survival. (B) Kaplan–Meier
  curve for cyclin E1 and CDK2 co-expression and overall survival. (C,D) cBioPortal
  GISTIC analysis for CCNE1 and CDK2 shows positive correlation between copy number
  alterations and mRNA levels in the Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma TCGA cohort.
  (E) Insulin signalling pathway showing higher mRNA levels of transcription factors
  (shaded, coloured boxes) associated with more strongly CCNE1-expressing tumours
  (edited from Maturity onset diabetes of the young KEGG pathway hsa04950). (F) Differential
  gene expression comparison between CCNE1 and CDK2 genes with a higher expression
  in quartile 4 tumours. (G) Differential gene expression comparison between CCNE1
  and CDK2 genes with a lower expression in quartile 4 tumours.
