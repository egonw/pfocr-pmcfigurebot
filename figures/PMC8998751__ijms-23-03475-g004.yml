caption: Expression of genes in the rubellin candidate biosynthetic cluster during
  disease development in artificially inoculated barley seedlings. Disease development
  was previously described by Dussart et al. []. Early symptoms appearance was recorded
  at 7 dpi, with typical lesions being clearly visible after 10 dpi. Genes represented
  in grey did not appear to be coregulated based on the RNA-seq data published by
  McGrann et al. []. The expression profile of gene Rcc_01325 was used to validate
  the results of the RNA-seq data. Data show mean normalised expression value ± standard
  error of three independent experiments.
