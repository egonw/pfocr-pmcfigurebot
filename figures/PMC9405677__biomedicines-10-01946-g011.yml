caption: Pathways altered by Arc knockdown. (A) Bar chart showing altered pathways
  identified by IPA. The orange line graph indicates the ratio of genes that were
  involved in the specified pathway. The grey line indicates threshold at p-value
  0.05. The orange and blue bars indicate predicted activation and inhibition of pathways,
  respectively (determined by z-score). (B) Top 15 significantly altered pathways
  are shown. Pathways with predicted activation or inhibition of downstream effects
  are in red, further elaborated in panel C. The top 5 genes altered in the respective
  pathways are shown on the right and bottom of the alter ed pathway bar chart. (C)
  Diagram describing the predicted effects of the altered pathways. Five pathways
  are highlighted, and the downstream effects as predicted by IPA are listed.
