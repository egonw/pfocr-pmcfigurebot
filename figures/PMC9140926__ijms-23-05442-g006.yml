caption: 'PUG decreases the mRNA and protein expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  COX2 and iNOS in activated RAW264.7 macrophage cells: (A) mRNA expression of COX2
  and iNOS; (B) Western blot analysis of COX2 and iNOS. For mRNA expression, the RNA
  was isolated from the cells after treatment and converted into cDNA. The converted
  cDNA was used for the quantitative expression. The Cq values were used for plotting
  the graph by the 2−ΔΔCq method. The relative expression for both genes was calculated
  by normalization with the β-actin gene. For protein expression, the protein was
  harvested from the cells and Western blotting was performed. The expression levels
  were calculated by the densitometry with the SEM of three independent values. The
  statistical significance was ### p < 0.001 vs. untreated group; and * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 vs. LPS-alone treated group.'
