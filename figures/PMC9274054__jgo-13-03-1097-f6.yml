caption: 'TRIM52 acts as an agonist in the NF-κB signaling pathway, with its site
  of action in the upstream pathway of NF-κB complex activation. NC: HCT116 cells
  transfected with negative control. siR-TRIM52 002: cell line transfected with TRIM52
  gene off SiRNA 002. siR-TRIM52 003: cell line transfected with TRIM52 gene off SiRNA
  003. vector: SW620 cells transfected with pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1- TRIM52: Cell line transfected
  with TRIM52/pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-CopGFP-T2A-puro as control. ****, P<0.0001. (A) LPS
  was cotreated with SiR-TRIM52 or NC control in HCT116 cells, and total cell protein
  was extracted after 48 h for WB assay to verify the intracellular expression changes
  of p-P65 and p-IKB. (B) PDTC was co-treated with TRIM52 overexpression plasmid or
  empty vector control in SW620 cells, and total cell protein was extracted for WB
  assay after 48 h to verify the changes of p-P65 and p-IKB expression in the cells.
  PDTC, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; WB, Western blot.'
