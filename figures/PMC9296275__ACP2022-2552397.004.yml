caption: (a) Genes highly correlated with KIF26B expression were analyzed using KEGG
  enrichment analysis. The PI3K-Akt signal pathway ranks first. (b) Western blot was
  used to detect the expression of key proteins in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway
  after knocking down KIF26B. (c) Western blot was used to detect the expression of
  phosphorylated AKT after knocking down KIF26B and adding PI3K pathway activator
  740 Y-P with concentration of 20 μM. (d, e, and f) After adding the PI3K pathway
  activator 740 Y-P (20 μM), the proliferation (d), migration (e), and cell cycle
  (F) of DAOY cells were observed again.
