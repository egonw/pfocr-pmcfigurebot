caption: Positive effect of p-AKK on nematodes’ healthy lifespan. (A) Analysis of
  lifespan of nematodes fed with different bacteria. N = 3; (B) Analysis of normal
  locomotion frequency with increasing age of nematodes fed with different bacteria.
  There were 10 worms in each group and the experiments were independently repeated
  three times; (C) Analysis of changes in movement state with increasing age of nematodes
  fed with different bacteria. The results are expressed as the mean ± SD and p-values
  were calculated by Duncan’s tests. Significant differences between groups are expressed
  by different letters (a,b) within the same day (p < 0.05). N = 3.
