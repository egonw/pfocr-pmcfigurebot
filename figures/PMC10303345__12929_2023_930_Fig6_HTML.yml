caption: IFI35 enhanced immunotherapy efficacy of CRC. A Effect of tumor IFI35 on
  OT-I-mediated tumor killing. OVA expressing IFI35 MC38 cells were co-cultured with
  OT-I cells for 24 h. Tumor cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry analysis.
  Results are shown as the percentages of 7-AAD+ tumor cells. n = 3. Error bars represent
  the mean ± SEM. Two tailed t-tests, ****P < 0.0001. B Specific lysis of Lovo tumor
  cells after coculture with CAR T cells at a 10:1 effector/target (E/T) ratio for
  4H, in the presence of 0, 0.625 and 1.25 µg/mL rhIFI35. n = 3. Error bars represent
  the mean ± SEM. Two tailed t-tests, *P < 0.05. C–E Overexpression of IFI35 improving
  the efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy. C The workflow of anti-PD1 therapy was shown.
  D, E CT26 cells were subcutaneously implanted into BALB/c mice and received anti-PD1
  therapy. The tumor size and tumor weight are shown. n = 4 mice for CT26 Ctrl IgG
  groups, n = 4 mice for CT26 Ctrl Anti-PD1 groups, n = 4 mice for CT26 IFI35 IgG
  groups, n = 3 mice for CT26 IFI35 Anti-PD1 groups. Data are presented as means ± SEMs,
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01
