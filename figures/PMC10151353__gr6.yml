caption: Cartilage intermediate layer protein 2 (CILP2) gene enrichment analysis in
  The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) COAD-READ dataset. (Aâ€“B) Heatmaps showing genes positively
  and negatively correlated with CILP2 in COAD-READ (top50). (C) Gene onthology (GO)
  analysis of CILP2-associated genes and prediction of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
  and Genomes (KEGG) pathway were performed. (D) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
  related to CILP2 expression. Terms with p values of <0.05 were considered significantly
  enriched.
