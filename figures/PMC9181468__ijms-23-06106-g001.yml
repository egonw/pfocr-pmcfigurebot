caption: Prolonged upregulated activation of the Notch2 signal transduction pathway
  in lacrimal glands prior to and during onset of the adaptive response. Notch2 is
  a transmembrane protein receptor whose extracellular portion is post-translationally
  modified in the Golgi bodies by furin and fringe molecules (i.e., Lfng, Mfng, or
  Rfng) prior to its insertion into the cellular membrane, thus enhancing subsequent
  MZB cell functions. On activation by a Notch2 ligand (i.e., Jagged and/or Delta
  molecules), the Notch2 molecule undergoes sequential cleavage first by Adam10 and
  then by γ-secretase, thereby releasing the cytoplasmic protein Dtx (an E3 ubiquitin
  ligase), as well as the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) that gets transported
  into the nucleus. In the nucleus, NICD displaces corepressors, including HDACs (histone
  deacetylase complex), allowing direct interaction with Rbpk to activate Hes, thus
  driving Notch2-regulated gene transcription. Downregulation of the Notch2 pathway
  occurs through phosphorylation of NCID by Cdk8 that initiates polyubiquitination
  and proteasome degradation. In this model, however, while the Notch2 pathway remains
  activated, Cdk8 exhibits, at best, minimal upregulated expression, suggesting the
  MZB cells may persist and over time differentiate from their effector function to
  their APC function for invoking the adaptive response.
