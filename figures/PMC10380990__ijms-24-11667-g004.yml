caption: 'Inhibitory effect of NP-2007 on LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) production
  and the NF-kB pathway in RAW 264.7 cells. (A) Effects of NP-2007 on RAW 264.7 cell
  viability. (B) NO production was determined in supernatants from RAW 264.7 cells.
  (C) Protein expression of iNOS, COX-2, and NF-kB signaling pathways were determined
  via Western blotting. SDS-PAGE effectively processed equivalent amounts of total
  proteins. (D) Quantitative analysis of blots. The densitometry results are represented
  as the relative protein band densities normalized to the β-actin level. All values
  represent the mean ± SD. Data were examined using Duncan’s multiple comparison test.
  *** p < 0.001 vs. control group; ### p < 0.001 vs. LPS group.'
