caption: Blocking autophagy inhibits apoptosis induced by PPI. (A,B) LC3 protein level
  was examined by Western blot assay after treatment with PPI and CQ for 12 and 24
  h, respectively. (C,D) The quantification of the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I. (E,F)
  Cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay after treatment with PPI and CQ for 12
  and 24 h, respectively. n = 3, the data are presented as means Â± SEM. * p < 0.05;
  ** p < 0.01.
