caption: Apoptosis induction by p53 in extrinsic (1) and intrinsic (2) pathways. In
  the extrinsic pathway, p53 activates Fas/APO1 and KILLER/DR5 genes that result in
  the expression of two membrane receptors, activating the caspase cascade and cell
  death. In the intrinsic pathway, p53 induces pro-apoptotic proteins (PIG3, bax)
  and inhibits anti-apoptotic proteins (bcl2). Pro-apoptotic proteins induce cytochrome-C
  release by mitochondria and activation of the caspase cascade and cell death.
