caption: (a) Wnt signaling pathway-related genes and osteogenesis-related genes expression
  of rBMSCs for 7 days (n = 4). (b) The relative ALP activity cultured for 3 days
  (n = 3). (c) Immunofluorescence images (The third column for β-catenin protein expression)
  of cells cultured for 3 days. ‘i’ means the addition of Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor
  DDK1 (0.5 μg·ml−1). It was showed that the inhibition of Wnt signaling pathway decreased
  expression of osteogenesis-related genes, indicating that the promotion of osteogenic
  differentiation by L-M/CS-8 was Wnt signaling pathway-dependent. (*P < 0.05, **P
