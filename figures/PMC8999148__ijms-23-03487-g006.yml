caption: 'The effect of NSC609077 on an EGFR-associated signaling pathway in H1975
  and A549 lung cancer cells. (A) Western blot showing EGFR, PI3K, and AKT in H1975
  and A549 cells treated with the IC20 (H1975, 1.13 µM; A549, 1.31 µM) of NSC609077
  for 48 h. (B) Western blot showing Src, STAT3, and ERK in H1975 and A549 cells treated
  with the IC20 of NSC609077 for 48 h. A549 cells with or without EGF stimulation.
  GAPDH served as the loading control. Protein expression was quantified with ImageJ
  software, and these data are shown below the gel graph. Abbreviations of genes/aliases-
  EGFR: Epidermal growth factor receptor, pEGFR: Phosphorylation of epidermal growth
  factor receptor, PI3K: Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic
  subunit beta, pPI3K: Phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase
  catalytic subunit beta, AKT: AKT serine/threonine kinase 1, pAKT: Phosphorylation
  of AKT serine/threonine kinase 1, SRC: SRC proto-oncogene, pSRC: Phosphorylation
  of SRC proto-oncogene, Stat3: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3,
  pStat3: Phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, ERK:
  Mitogen-activated protein kinase 1, pERK: Phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein
  kinase 1, GAPDH: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.'
