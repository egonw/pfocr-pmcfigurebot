caption: The expression of LTB4R and its relationship with survival and clinical traits
  in ccRCC. LTB4R knockdown inhibited the proliferation and colony formation of ccRCC
  cells. (A) Expression difference of LTB4R between ccRCC samples (n = 530) and normal
  samples (n = 129) by using TCGA and GTEx databases. Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p <
  0.0001. (B) Expression difference of LTB4R between ccRCC samples (n = 530) and normal
  samples (n = 168) by using TCGA database. Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p < 0.0001. (C)
  Risk model survival curve analysis. Log-rank test, p = 4.2 × 10−5. (D) High expression
  of LTB4R was related to higher tumor stage. Wilcoxon rank-sum test, ** p < 0.001.
  (E) RT-qPCR detected the knockdown efficiency of LTB4R. (F) Western Blot Analysis
  to verify the knockdown efficiency of LTB4R. (G) Knockdown of LTB4R inhibited the
  proliferation of Caki1 and ACHN cells. (H,I) After knockdown of LTB4R, the cloning
  formation ability of Caki1 and ACHN cells were decreased. A 2-tailed t test was
  used in E and I (** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001).
