caption: 'Piperlongumine (PL) and vitamin C (VC) regulated signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3 (STAT3) signalling in opposite ways in two gastric cancer cell
  lines in vitro: (a) AGS and KATO III cells were treated with a range of concentrations
  of PL for 24 h and then they were subjected to Western blot analysis to measure
  the protein levels of p-STAT3, STAT3 and survivin. β-actin served as an internal
  control; (b) the relative levels of protein compared with β-actin after treatment
  with PL. Data presented as mean ± SD; (c) AGS and KATO III cells were treated with
  a range of concentrations of VC for 24 h and then they were subjected to Western
  blot analysis to measure the protein levels of p-STAT3, STAT3 and survivin. β-actin
  served as an internal control; (d) the relative levels of protein compared with
  β-actin after treatment with VC. Data presented as mean ± SD; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001 compared with the control group (treated with the vehicle dimethyl
  sulfoxide); analysis of variance.'
