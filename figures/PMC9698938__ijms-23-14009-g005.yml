caption: Hepatocyte-specific DAX1 deletion augments expression of chemokines and adhesion
  molecules related to T lymphocyte recruitment. (a–f) WT and Dax1 LKO mice were treated
  with a single administration of ConA (15 mg/kg, i.v.) or PBS. The liver samples
  were isolated at 6 h (PBS; n = 3, ConA; n = 6) following treatment. (a) The expression
  of CC chemokine Ccl5, (b–d) CXC chemokines (Cxcl9, Cxcl10, and Cxcl11), and (e,f)
  adhesion molecules (Icam1 and Vcam1) were examined using RT-qPCR (three technical
  replicates for each pooled sample from mice). (g–l) Primary hepatocytes from WT
  and Dax1 LKO mice were isolated and treated with TNF-α (120 ng/mL) for 1 h. mRNA
  extracts from cells were conducted using RT-qPCR to measure the expression levels
  of Ccl5, Cxcl9, Cxcl10, Cxcl11, Icam1, and Vcam1 (examinations were performed in
  five technical replicates). Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM. Tukey–Kramer test
  after the one-way ANOVA was used to compare the ConA-treated LKO and ConA-treated
  WT groups (a–f) and the TNF-α-treated LKO and TNF-α-treated WT groups (g–l); * p
  < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001.
