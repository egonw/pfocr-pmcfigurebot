caption: The effects of enforced NEAT1 on tumour growth and metastasis of BC. A The
  tumour implant was established as an orthotopic bladder cancer model, leading to
  tumorigenicity in vivo (the bladder model is marked by the red arrow). B The bladder
  weight of mice was significantly increased in the NEAT1 group; **p < 0.05 NEAT1
  group versus CON and NC groups. C–H Histopathological cell morphology of the bladder,
  liver, lung, kidney, stomach and heart tissues was examined by H&E staining (magnification, × 200).
  Bladder cancer cells showed high-grade dysplasia, disorder, hyperchromatic nuclei
  and nuclear division in bladder tissues in all groups (the cancer cell is marked
  by the black arrow). Liver metastasis occurred only in the NEAT1 group, as indicated
  by necrosis of large numbers of hepatocytes and infiltration of cancer cells (the
  metastatic foci is marked by the black arrow). No metastatic lesions were detected
  in the lung, kidney, stomach and heart, in the three groups

  the miR-101/VEGF-C pathway in vitro and in vivo.
