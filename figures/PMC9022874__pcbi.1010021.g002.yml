figure_title: Functional genomic analysis of effective drugs treated cell lines
caption: (A) Inferred pathway and (B) TF activities of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug-treated
  cell lines. Activities were calculated from LINCS-L1000 consensus drug-induced signatures,
  using PROGENy and DoRothEA tools for pathway and TF activities, respectively. Drug
  clusters in (B) are color coded. Only selected transcription factors (corresponding
  to ) are shown. (C) Relationship between average TF activities induced by drug treatment
  and SARS-CoV-2 infection for 5 different drug clusters (colors of clusters correspond
  to panel B). TFs with the highest/lowest average activities are text labeled. (D)
  Density plot of similarities between SARS-CoV-2- and drug-induced signatures for
  all LINCS-L1000 drugs and known anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs (ChEMBL drugs).
