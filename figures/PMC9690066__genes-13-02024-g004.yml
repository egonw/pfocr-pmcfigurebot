caption: 'Conceptual framework model of host–microbial interactions in food reactions:
  The results of this study support a conceptual framework for FR pathophysiology
  involving host–microbiome interactions. Elevated levels of pathogenic Cyanobacteria
  may directly induce inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6). IL-6 is
  a known activator of the JAK-STAT pathway, resulting in a Th2 response. Host microRNA
  responses (such as a decrease in miR-203b-3p) have been shown to indirectly stimulate
  JAK2/STAT3 signaling by increasing the levels of IL-6 through the regulation of
  the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS3), which normally suppresses the downstream
  effects of IL-6. Red arrows depict secondary processes associated with the conceptual
  food reaction pathway.'
