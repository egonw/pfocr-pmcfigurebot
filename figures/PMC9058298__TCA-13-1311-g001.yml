caption: Inhibition of progression of lung cancer cells induced by hnRNPK‐knockdown
  is dependent on activation of p53 by the p53/p21/cyclin D1 pathway. In response
  to DNA damage, ATM and ATR are activated and then phosphorylate H2A.X. The signaling
  transducers CHK1 and CHK2 are also phosphorylated subsequently leading to the phosphorylation
  and stabilization of hnRNPK and p53. This can transcriptionally activate the downstream
  signals such as p21 and other DNA damage repair associated genes. Therefore, p21
  interacts with cyclin D1 finally resulting in cell cycle arrest
