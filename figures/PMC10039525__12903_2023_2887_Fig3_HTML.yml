caption: KEGG and GSEA enrichment analysis of DEGs in NFs and CAL27 cells after low-dose
  arecoline treatment. A, B For the scatter diagram of KEGG enrichment analysis, KEGG
  enrichment is measured by gene ratio, p-value, and the number of enriched genes
  in the pathway. Gene ratio refers to the ratio of the number of DEGs enriched in
  the pathway to the total number of DEGs. A larger GeneRatio indicates a greater
  degree of enrichment, and the value range of the p-value is [0,1]. The closer it
  is to zero, the more significant the enrichment is. C GSEA of key pathways in CAL27
  cells by induction of low-dose arecoline. p-value < 0.05 and normalized enrichment
  score |NES|> 1 were considered statistically significant. NES, normalized enrichment
  score. FDR, false discovery rate. Positive and negative NES indicate higher and
  lower expression after low-dose arecoline treatment. GSEA, gene set enrichment analysis
