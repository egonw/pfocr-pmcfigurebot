caption: 'High expression of TNFAIP6 in GC tissues: (a) the TNFAIP6 expression levels
  in 31 pairs of GC tissues and the matched paracancerous tissues are measured by
  qRT-PCR (∗∗P < 0.01 compared with paracancerous), (b) the analysis of TNFAIP6 expression
  in paracancerous and GC tissues, (c) the patients are divided into high and low
  TNFAIP6 expression groups according to the scoring of immunohistochemical staining,
  (d) TNFAIP6 mRNA expression levels are determined using qRT-PCR in GC cells and
  GES-1 (∗∗P < 0.01 compared with GES-1).'
