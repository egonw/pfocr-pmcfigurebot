caption: Pathway activity analysis in normal and DCIS MALINC1-transduced cells. (a)
  Heatmap of integrated pathways activities (IPAs) differentially modulated in MALINC1-overexpressing
  cells as predicted by PARADIGM using the normalized RNA-seq expression profiles
  (p-adj. < 0.01). (b) Circular bar plot of the top 10 most significantly activated
  IPAs in MCF10A and DCIS.COM MALINC1-overexpressing cell lines. (c,d) Agarose gel
  of MALINC1, FOS, and JUN RT-PCR amplicons in the T47D luminal-like breast cancer
  cell line. (d) Evaluation of MALINC1, FOS, and JUN expression levels by RT-qPCR
  on breast normal and tumor samples. Gene expression levels were normalized to the
  RNA18S transcript and discretized in undetectable (negative in white boxes), low-,
  or high-MALINC1-expressing samples (gray or black boxes, respectively).
