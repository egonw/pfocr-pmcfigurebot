caption: Corroded granules activated autophagy through AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway.
  (a–c) Phosphorylation of AMPK (p-AMPK) and the protein level of LC3-II were increased
  in corroded granules group, whereas the phosphorylation of mTOR (p-mTOR) was reduced.
  (d) LC3-II and p62 expression induced by corroded granules were decreased in AMPK-deficient
  VSMC. (e–f) EdU-positive cells were remarkably increased in AMPK-deficient VSMC.
  The white arrow indicates EdU-positive cells. (g) Decreased protein expression of
  p62 and LC3-III were elevated in stainless granules group after introducing the
  rapamycin. (h) Rapamycin pre-treatment significantly reduced the number of EdU-positive
  cells in stainless granules group. (i) Corrode iron stent implanted group exhibited
  increased AMPK expression and mTOR down-regulation compared to that of S316L stent
  group. Bars represent mean ​± ​SD. ∗P ​< ​0.05.
