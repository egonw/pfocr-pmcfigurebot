caption: 'Effects of Pae on fecal metabolism in DSS-induced UC mice. (A) Principal
  Component Analysis (PCA) score plot of Con, DSS, Pae-L, Pae-H and SASP groups and
  QC samples. (B) Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) score plot
  from Con, DSS, Pae-L, Pae-H and SASP groups. (C) Heatmap of fecal differential metabolite
  profiles in mice. (D) Metabolic pathway enrichment analysis. (E) Total BA concentrations
  in fecal contents. (F) Quantitative abundance of significantly altered BAs from
  different groups (nmol/g). Date are shown as mean Â± sem. n = 7 or 8.# p < 0.5; ##
  p < 0.01; ### p < 0.001, compared with Con group, * p < 0.5; ** p < 0.01, compared
  with DSS group.'
