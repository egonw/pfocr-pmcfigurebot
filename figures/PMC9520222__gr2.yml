caption: The promoted chondrogenic differentiation of hUC-MSCs treated with different
  LDH nanoparticles. A) Negative surface markers identification of hUC-MSCs. B) Positive
  surface markers identification of hUC-MSCs. C) Alcian staining of hUC-MSCs for 10
  days and 14 days chondrogenic differentiation, respectively. (Ctrl-CHO represents
  the control group for the same chondrogenic differentiation without adding LDH nanoparticles)
  Scale bar = 100 μm. D) qPCR analysis of total chondrogenic markers COLX and SOX9
  in LDH treated hUC-MSCs for 10 days and 14 days chondrogenic differentiation, respectively.
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. E) qPCR analysis of NP marker genes COL2A1,
  ACAN and COMP, and AF marker genes COL1A1, COL3A1, COL6A1 and TNMD expression under
  5 μg/mL and 10 μg/mL MgAl–Cl and MgFe–NO3 LDH treatment for 14 days. *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. F) Immunofluorescence staining of SOX9 and COL1A1 in selected
  MgAl–Cl and MgFe–NO3 LDH treated hUC-MSCs for 14 days chondrogenic differentiation.
  Scale bar = 10 μm.
