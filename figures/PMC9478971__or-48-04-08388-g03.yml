caption: RON and c-Met mediates PCa metastasis via the ERK1/2 pathway. (A) Effect
  of RON and c-Met on phosphorylation of p-ERK1/2 was analyzed by western blotting.
  (B) PC3 and DU145 cells were treated with MSP or HGF for 24 h. Level of p-ERK1/2
  was detected by western blotting. (C and D) Migration and invasion assays were carried
  out in the PC3 and DU145 cells following treatment with MSP, HGF and U0126 for 24
  h (magnification, Ã—200). Each experiment was performed in triplicate. **P<0.01,
  ***P<0.001.
