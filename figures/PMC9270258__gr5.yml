caption: Ethanol induced FGF21 in iPSC-derived brain organoids and activated the release
  of catecholamines. (A) A schematic outline of procedures used during the differentiation
  of iPSC-derived brain organoids. The panel below the schematic displays representative
  examples of staining for tyrosin hydroxylase (TH), and Neuron-specific class III
  beta-tubulin (TUJ1). (B) the effect of ethanol on FGF21 concentration was measure
  using ELISA. Dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine concentrations were measured
  using UPLC–Tandem Mass Spectrometry. (C) A schematic outline of the catecholamine
  biosynthesis pathway. (D) mRNA expression of SNHG16, MAOA, MAOB, COMT, TH, COMT,
  DDC, DBH, and PNMT in response to ethanol treatment (25 mM) for 7 days. Realtime
  PCR experiments were performed in iPSC-derived brain organoids (n = 3). The expression
  of these genes was determined after exposure to drug for 7 days. ∗A p value ≤ 0.05
  was considered statistically significant (two tailed paired t test). All values
  shown are mean ± S.E.M.
