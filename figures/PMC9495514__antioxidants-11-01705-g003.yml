caption: Analysis of DEGs profiling of the liver in mice. (a) The DEGs between WT
  versus db/db groups and ICS II versus db/db groups were summarized in a Venn diagram.
  (b) The correlation coefficients between altered gene expression profiles were analyzed
  using hierarchical clustering analysis. (c) Top KEGG pathways enriched with DEGs
  and their matching P values. (d–f) Bar graph shows the fold enrichment values of
  the top 10 most significantly enriched terms for the regulation of genes, analyzed
  by GO terms.
