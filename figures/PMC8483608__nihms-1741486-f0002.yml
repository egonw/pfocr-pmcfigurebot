caption: Proposed mechanism of prodrug action. Before drug treatment, the GAGs–protein
  complex, collectively known as proteoglycan (PG), decorates all cell surfaces and
  the extracellular matrix. The GAG coreceptor can extend to neighboring membrane
  proteins and presents various ligands such as growth factors, cytokines, and matrix
  proteins. When lipophilic prodrug is added to the cell, it undergoes passive diffusion
  through the membrane, hydrolysis by carboxylesterase (EC 3.1.1.1) enzymes, and inhibition
  of the GAG biosynthetic pathway. The drug thereby engenders truncation of the GAG
  coreceptor and disruption of cell signaling.
