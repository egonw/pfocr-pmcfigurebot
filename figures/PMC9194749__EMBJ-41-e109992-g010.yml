figure_title: Autophagy during epidermal wound healing
caption: 'A–DAppearance of autophagic structures (marked with GFP‐Atg8a) during wound
  closure in the epidermis of control third instar larvae and after epidermal knockdown
  of the autophagy pathway components Atg1, Atg5, Atg6, Atg7 or Atg12. All constructs
  are expressed in the epidermis under the control of the A58‐Gal4 driver. (A) Time
  points from movies of wounded epidermis. The wounds have closed by 2 h in all cases.
  (B) Higher magnification of the areas marked by magenta boxes at t = 120 min. (C)
  Quantification of the appearance of GFP‐Atg8a puncta in the imaged area (10,000 µm2)
  3 control larvae, shown for each individual larva. (D) Quantification of number
  of GFP‐Atg8a puncta in different genetic conditions measured in an area of 10,000 µm2
  at the time of wound closure; n = 4–10 larvae each genotype, for the detail see
  Data analysis. We assumed unequal sample size and unequal variances and calculations
  were performed. Values are presented as box plots. Box plot elements are: centre
  line, median; box limits, upper and lower quartiles; whiskers, 1.5× interquartile
  range; points, outliers. For statistical hypothesis testing, independent and non‐parametric
  (Kruskal–Wallis) t‐tests were performed for the mean number of spots in control
  and experimental conditions. P‐values are indicated as follows: *P < 0.04; ***P < 0.0002
  and lack of an asterisk means non‐significant (P > 0.123).E, FEffect of suppressing
  autophagy on wound healing and actin cable formation. Time‐lapse series of single‐cell
  wound healing in larvae expressing (E) Src‐GFP (green) and DsRed2‐Nuc (magenta)
  to mark cell membrane and nuclei and (F) endogenously GFP‐tagged E‐cadherin (DE‐cad‐GFP;
  green) and mCherry‐marked myosin regulatory light chain (Sqh‐mCherry; magenta) to
  visualize adherens junctions and actomyosin cables. Data information: (A, B, E,
  F) Z–projections of time‐lapse series in early L3 larvae, n = 9–15 larvae each genotype.
  Scale bars, A, E, F, 20 μm and B, 10 μm. Pre W: pre‐wounding. Images from Movies
