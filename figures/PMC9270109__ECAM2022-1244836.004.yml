caption: miR-126 targets PIK3R2 and PI3K/mTOR signaling in lung cancer cells. (a)
  The functions of miRNAs are elucidated with analyses of the genes they target. PIK3R2
  was identified as a putative target of miR-126; (b) KD of miR-126 could increase
  the protein level of phospharylated PI3K and mTOR, but not the protein level of
  total PI3K and mTOR in A549 cells; (c) KD of miR-126 could increase the protein
  level of phospharylated PI3K and mTOR, but not the protein level of total PI3K and
  mTOR in H1650 cells.
