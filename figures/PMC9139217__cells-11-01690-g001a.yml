caption: Effects of platinum chemotherapeutic drugs on the levels of gonadotropin,
  melatonin, and oxidative stress in the peripheral blood of male gastrointestinal
  tumor patients, and reducing the expression of MT1/MT2 in the testis. (A) Human
  testicular tissue was stained with H&E (scale bar = 50 μm). (B) Images of TUNEL
  staining in human testicular tissue (scale bar = 50 μm). (C) Representative immunofluorescent
  pictures of MT1 in human testicular tissue; 3β-HSD was tagged with red fluorescence
  and MT1 was tagged with green fluorescence. The nucleus was labeled with DAPI (scale
  bar = 20 μm). (D) Representative immunofluorescent pictures of MT2 in human testicular
  tissue; 3β-HSD was tagged with red fluorescence and MT2 was tagged with green fluorescence.
  The nucleus was labeled with DAPI (scale bar = 20 μm). (E) MT1 mRNA expression in
  human testicular tissue. (F) MT2 mRNA expression in human testicular tissue. (G)
  GnRH level in human serum. (H) FSH level in human serum. (I) LH level in human serum.
  (J) Testosterone level in human serum. (K) Melatonin level in human serum. (L) Content
  of MDA in human serum. (M) SOD activity in human serum. (N) Total antioxidant capacity
  in human serum. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. N = 3 cases per group in (A–F).
  N = 30 cases per group in (G–N). CT, chemotherapy. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 versus
  the control group or the tumor group.
