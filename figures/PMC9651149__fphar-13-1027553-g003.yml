caption: 'The expression of HO-1 in chondrocytes that have been exposed to H2O2 is
  linked to the anti-apoptotic and anti-chondral degrading effects of GC. (A and B)
  Western blot images and quantification information for the protein expression of
  the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway in each group following the aforementioned treatment.
  (C) Immunofluorescence detection of nuclear translocation of Nrf2 protein with DAPI
  staining for nuclei. 200 µm scale bar. (D and E) Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate
  (DCFH-DA) fluorescent staining showed that GC inhibited the H2O2 induced ROS production.
  400 µm scale bar. (F–J) Western blot imaging and quantification data for each group
  treated with H2O2, GC, and 10 μM Zinc (II) Protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP) for HO-1, iNOS,
  SOX9, COX-2, MMP3, MMP13, ADAMTS4, Bcl-2, Bax, and Cleved-caspase 3. All data are
  presented as mean ± SD (n = 3). *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 vs. control group; #p <
  0.05 and ##p < 0.01 vs. H2O2 group; ＆p < 0.05 and ＆＆p < 0.01 vs. H2O2 + GC group.'
