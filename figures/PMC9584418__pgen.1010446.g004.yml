figure_title: The ILF pathway degrades Mup1 in response to heat stress or cycloheximide
  in cells missing ESCRTs
caption: '(A) Fluorescence and DIC micrographs of live wild type or vps36Δ cells stained
  with FM4-64 expressing Mup1-pHluorin before (control) or after addition of 100 μM
  cycloheximide (CHX) or heat stress (HS; 42°C for 15 minutes). Arrowheads indicate
  Mup1-pHluorin on vacuole membranes. (B) Proportion of wild type or vps36Δ cells
  showing Mup1-pHluorin fluorescence on the plasma membrane (PM) or vacuole membranes
  (VM) before or after treatment with cycloheximide (CHX) or heat stress (HS). (below)
  Micrographs show Mup1-pHluorin location within cells; arrowheads indicate vacuole
  membranes. Number of cells analyzed (control, HS, CHX) are: WT (318, 315, 365),
  vps36Δ (324,327,339). (C) Fluorescence and DIC micrographs of live wild type or
  vps27Δ cells stained with FM4-64 expressing Mup1-GFP after addition of cycloheximide
  or heat stress. Three-dimensional Mup1-GFP fluorescence intensity (FI) plots and
  line plots of GFP or FM4-64 for lines shown above in micrographs indicate boundary
  membrane localization. (D) Mup1-GFP fluorescence measured within boundary membranes
  between docked vacuoles within live vps27Δ cells before (control; CTL) or after
  addition of cycloheximide (CHX) or heat stress (HS). Mup1-GFP was absent from vacuole
  membranes under control conditions and not analyzed (n.a.). Number of vps27Δ cells
  analyzed (HS, CHX) are: 60, 28. (E) Snapshots from time-lapse movies showing homotypic
  vacuole fusion events within live vps27Δ cells stained with FM4-64 expressing Mup1-GFP
  treated with cycloheximide or heat stress. Dotted lines indicate cell perimeters;
  arrowheads indicate newly formed ILFs. See  and  Videos. (F) Western blot analysis
  of whole cell lysates prepared from wild type or vps36Δ cells expressing Mup1-GFP
  before (control; CTL) or after heat stress (HS) or cycloheximide (CHX) treatment.
  Blots are stained with anti-GFP or anti-G6PDH antibodies. Estimated molecular weights
  are shown. (G) Intact Mup1-GFP band densities relative to control and normalized
  to load controls (G6PDH) were calculated for each condition shown in F. n = 3 for
  each strain tested. (H) Light micrographs showing methylene blue (MB) stained cultures
  of wild type, vps27Δ, vps36Δ, vps23Δ, snf7Δ, vam3Δ, vps36Δvam3Δ, ssa2Δ, hsc82Δ or
  fet5Δ cells before or after heat stress (HS). Arrowheads indicate MB-positive cells.
  (I) Images in H were used to measure proportion of dead, MB-positive cells in the
  population. Number of cells analyzed (control, HS) are: 3,232, 1,995 wild type;
  2,023, 1,647 vps27Δ; 2,226, 1,548 vps36Δ; 1,877, 1,743 vps23Δ; 1,563, 1,470 snf7Δ;
  3,021, 1,971 vam3Δ; 2,081, 1,540 vps36Δvam3Δ; 3,305, 2,017 ssa2Δ; 3,401, 2,001 hsc82Δ;
  2,061, 1,323 fet5Δ. Means (bars) ± S.E.M. and results from Student t-test are shown.
  Vacuole membranes were stained with FM4-64. Scale bars, 1 μm (except in H, 5 μm).'
