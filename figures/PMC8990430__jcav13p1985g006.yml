caption: (A) KEGG pathway analysis of the genes significantly correlated with the
  ASF1b expression in GC from cBioPortal. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
  (KEGG). (B) GO analysis of ASF1b co-expressed genes in GC, Gene ontology (GO), Biological
  process(BP), Cellular component (CC), Molecular factor(MF). (C) MRNA levels of cell
  cycle-related markers in AGS cells transfected with ASF1b-si/NC using q-PCR. (D)
  MRNA levels of cell cycle-related markers in AGS cells transfected with vector/ASF1b-OE
  using q-PCR. (E) The protein expression levels of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in GC cell
  lines after ASF1b-si. (F) The protein expression levels of cell cycle-related markers
  in GC cell lines after ASF1b-OE.
