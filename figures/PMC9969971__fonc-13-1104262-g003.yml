caption: Comparison of cellular interactions between samples from tumour and adjacent
  normal tissues. (A) Cellular interaction number and strength. (B) Bar graph illustrating
  the total number (left) and weight (right) of ligand−receptor interactions between
  samples from tumour and adjacent normal tissues. (C, D) Heatmap showing possible
  afferent or efferent signalling pathways between cells. (E) Comparative profiles
  of pathway signal intensities indicating conserved and specific signalling pathways
  in tumour and normal tissue samples. (F, G) Communication quantity and intensity
  differences network. Red and blue colours represent upregulated and downregulated
  pathways, respectively, relative to normal tissues. (H, I) Dot plots show the variation
  in the signalling action of hepatocytes relative to other cell types.
article_title: Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals the metabolic changes and
  the prognostic value of malignant hepatocyte subpopulations and predict new therapeutic
  agents for hepatocellular carcinoma.
