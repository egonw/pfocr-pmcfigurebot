caption: 'CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing. (a) Principal strategy for the generation
  of DNA knockouts. gRNAs (gRNA1, gRNA2, and gRNA3) were designed flanking the genomic
  target to delete the two targeted DNA segments comprising either the five (506 bp)
  or the eight (1262 bp) candidate SNPs, creating double-strand breaks (DSBs) at 3
  bp upstream of the PAM. The resulting DSB is repaired by the NHEJ pathway. The genomic
  deletion is detected by PCR using primers (F1, R1) and (F2, R2) providing the amplicons
  of 335 bp and 355 bp, respectively. (b) qPCR analysis of gene expression in wild-type
  K562 cells and the deleted ATP2B4 clones (for the five candidate SNPs) to quantify
  either all the transcripts or only the two long transcripts of ATP2B4. (c) qPCR
  analysis of gene expression in wild-type K562 cells and the deleted ATP2B4 clones
  (for the eight SNPs) to quantify either all the transcripts or only the two long
  transcripts of ATP2B4. Error bars illustrate standard deviation (n = 3 independent
  RNA/cDNA preparations): **** p < 0.0001.'
