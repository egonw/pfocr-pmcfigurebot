caption: Venn diagram Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) readouts of plasma EV proteomes.
  (A). Venn diagram showing overlapping and unique protein numbers from each plasma
  EV category. (B). Top networks derived from IPA Core Analysis for each plasma EV
  proteome showing the predominance of immunoglobulin networks (Networks were all
  entitled “Cancer, Infectious Disease, Organismal Injury and Abnormalities”; scores
  = 65–67; 33 focus molecules). (C). Comparison Analysis conducted on all four plasma
  EV datasets from four different patients or controls showing hierarchical clustering
  of the top 30 Disease and BioFunction significant categories. This is a partial
  representation; the full table of all 636 categories is found in .
