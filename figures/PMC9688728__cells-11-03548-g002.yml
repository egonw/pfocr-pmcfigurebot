caption: Results of pathway analysis via MetaboAnalyst against (a) KEGG and (b) SMPDB
  datasets in terms of p-value and pathway impact. Each cycle represents a pathway;
  its color denotes the significance level (from low—pale yellow to high—red). Most
  significant pathways (p-value < 0.01 and <0.05 for KEGG and SMPDB, correspondingly)
  are additionally indicated.
