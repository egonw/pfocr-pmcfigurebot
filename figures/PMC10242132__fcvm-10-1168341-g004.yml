  and the skeletal muscle cells of rats. (A) TUNEL staining of the cardiac muscle
  cells of rats. (B) TUNEL staining of the skeletal muscle cells of rats. (C) Comparison
  of apoptosis in the cardiac muscle cells of rats. (D) Comparison of apoptosis in
  the skeletal muscle cells of rats. Compared with the sham-operated group, ##P < 0.01.
  Compared with the model group, **P < 0.01.'
