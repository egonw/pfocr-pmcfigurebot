caption: METTL14 activates the Wnt/β‐catenin signalling pathway (Wβ‐CSP) in CM cells.
  (A) The β‐catenin expression of the Wnt signalling pathway was examined by WB analysis
  in METTL14 stably‐transfected OCM1 and MUM‐2B cells. (B) The expression of critical
  members of the Wnt signalling pathway was validated by WB in METTL14 stably‐transfected
  OCM1 and MUM‐2B cells.

  RUNX2 mRNA via m6A modification.
