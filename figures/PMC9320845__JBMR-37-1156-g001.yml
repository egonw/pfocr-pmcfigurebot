caption: RNA sequencing of sost KO and WT intervertebral disc (IVD). (A) PCA plot
  of sost KO (n = 4) and WT (n = 5) IVDs demonstrating an overlap between the groups.
  (B) Top 20 downregulated and top 20 upregulated pathways after sost deletion. (C)
  Corresponding heat maps for protein folding associated with the top downregulated
  pathway (arrowhead in B) and immune response associated with the top upregulated
  pathway (arrowhead in B). (D) Volcano plot of all differentially regulated genes,
  with labels of most significantly regulated genes (FDR < 0.05).
