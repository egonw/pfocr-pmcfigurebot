caption: 'hUCMSC-EVs ameliorate TGF-β1-induced LF cell fibrosis by inhibiting TGF-β/SMAD4
  signalling through the activities of miR-146a-5p and miR-221-3p. (A) A Venn diagram
  predicting all common targets of miRNAs with different algorithms. (B) Result of
  the Gene Ontology analysis of the putative target genes of miR-146a-5p and miR-221-3p.
  (C) Results of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis of the
  putative target genes of miR-146a-5p and miR-221-3p. (D) Results of the RT-qPCR
  analysis of the mRNA expression of SMAD4 in LF cells after transfection of miR-146a-5p
  and miR-221-3p mimics/mimics NC and their inhibitors/inhibitor NC (n = 3). (E, F)
  Results of the Western blot analysis of the protein expression of SMAD4 in LF cells
  after transfection of miR-146a-5p and miR-221-3p mimics/mimics NC and their inhibitors/inhibitor
  NC (n = 3). (G, H) Results of the Western blot analysis of the protein expression
  of SMAD4 in the presence or absence of TGF-β1 and various modified hUCMSC-EVs (n = 3).
  (I) Result of the bioinformatic analysis of the predicted binding site of miR-146a-5p
  and miR-221-3p targeting the 3′-UTR of SMAD4 in TargetScan (http://www.targetscan.org/vert_72/).
  (J) Luciferase activities detected using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system
  after mimic-NC, miR-146a-5p mimic, miR-221-3p mimic, inhibitor-NC, miR-146a-5p inhibitor,
  or miR-221-3p inhibitor and plasmid containing the wild-type or mutant 3′-UTR of
  SMAD4 were co-transfected into LF cells (n = 3). (K) Results of the Western blot
  analysis of the protein expression of SMAD4 with different amounts of transfected
  plasmid DNA (n = 3). (L) Results of the RT-qPCR analysis of the mRNA expressions
  of the fibrosis markers (Col-I, α-SMA, and Col-III) in the presence or absence of
  TGF-β1, hUCMSC-EVs, and SMAD4 overexpression (n = 3). (M, N) Results of the Western
  blot analysis of the protein expressions of the fibrosis markers (Col-I, α-SMA,
  and Col-III) in the presence or absence of TGF-β1, hUCMSC-EVs, and SMAD4 overexpression
  (n = 3). (O) Representative immunofluorescence images of the fibrosis markers (Col-I,
  α-SMA, and Col-III) in the presence or absence of TGF-β1, hUCMSC-EVs, and SMAD4
  overexpression (n = 3). Data are presented as mean ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  compared with the control group. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, compared with the TGF-β1
  group. &P < 0.05, &&P < 0.01, compared with the TGF-β1+EVs group.'
