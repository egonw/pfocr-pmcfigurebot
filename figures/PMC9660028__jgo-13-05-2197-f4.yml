caption: CAFs promoted ERK1/2, JNK, and Wnt/β-catenin pathways activation on GC cells.
  The GC cell lines (including MGC-803, AGS, and SGC-7901) were co-cultured with or
  without CAFs. IWR-1 was adopted to inhibit the Wnt pathway in GC cells. (A-C) Western
  blot was adopted to test the levels of ERK1/2, JNK, and Wnt/β-catenin (including
  β-catenin, c-Myc, and Cyclin D1) in GC cells. *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.001
  (vs. Con group); *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.001 (vs. CAFsi-NC group); *, P<0.05;
  **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.001 (vs. CAF+Veh group), N=3. CAFs, cancer-associated fibroblasts;
  GC, gastric cancer.
