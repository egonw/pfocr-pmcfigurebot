caption: Topology map of altered metabolic pathways describing the impact of metabolites
  selected from comparative post-hoc analysis (Tukeyâ€™s HSD). (a) The top five altered
  metabolic pathways in the COVID-19 pneumonia (CovP) group. 1. Arginine biosynthesis,
  2. Glutathione metabolism, 3. Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, 4. Pyruvate metabolism,
  5. Alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism. (b) The top five altered metabolic
  pathways in the non-COVID-19 pneumonia (CAP) group. 1. Pentose phosphate pathway,
  2. Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, 3. Pentose and glucuronate interconversions, 4.
  Phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan metabolism, 5. Valine, leucine and isoleucine
  metabolism.
