caption: Schematic illustration of the effects of methylglyoxal (MG) in myoblast cells.
  MG induces metabolic flow change (such as switching to the glucose-citrate-fatty
  acid synthesis pathway) and mitochondrial damage, reactive oxygen species generation,
  interleukin-6 increase, and activation of the muscle atrophy pathway.
