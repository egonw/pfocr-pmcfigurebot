caption: 'NBDP significantly inhibited TF, PAI-1, and TAT, and promoted APC secretions
  in LPS-induced lung tissues. A: ELISA detection of the changes of TF following LPS
  induction with or without NBDP. B: ELISA detection of the changes of PAI-1 following
  LPS induction with or without NBDP; C: ELISA detection of the changes of TAT following
  LPS induction with or without NBDP; D: ELISA detection of the changes of APC secretions
  following LPS induction with or without NBDP; Values were presented as mean ± SD.
  *P<0.05 compared with Control. #P<0.05 compared with Model. &P<0.05 compared with
  N-NBD. %P<0.05 compared with L-NBD. $P<0.05 compared with M-NBD.'
