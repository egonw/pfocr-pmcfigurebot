caption: FAM107A expression was higher in normal prostate tissues than in prostate
  cancer tissues. (A) Measurement of protein levels of FAM107A in normal and prostate
  cancer tissues by immunohistochemical analysis. Representative images were shown
  at magnifications of 50× and 200×, respectively. (B) Protein levels of FAM107A in
  normal and prostate cancer tissues by Western blotting.
