caption: 'Characterization of uEVs from healthy controls(A) A schematic of the study
  outlining the discovery and validation cohort.(B) Negative stain transmission electron
  microscopy of uEVs. Scale bars, 200 nm.(C) Nanoparticle tracking analysis of uEVs
  isolated from healthy controls.(D) Venn diagram of total proteins detected in uEVs
  isolated from healthy controls.(E) Bar plot representing the abundance of common
  classical exosomal markers (CD63, CD9) and markers for classical microvesicles (Annexin
  A1) and arrestin-domain-containing protein 1-mediated microvesicles (TSG101) in
  healthy controls. The yaxis represents log10 relative abundance.(F) KEGG/Wiki pathway
  analysis (g:profiler) of the 1,298 common proteins in uEVs from healthy controls.
  The top five terms with the lowest adjusted p values were extracted.(G) Intrarenal
  expression of top 50 molecules in uEVs from healthy controls visualized using kidney
  cell explorer () in order of relative abundance and immunofluorescence of human
  kidney specimens of 5 out of 50 molecules. Glutathione hydrolase 1 proenzyme (GGT1),
  phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), uromodulin (UMOD), annexin A11 (ANXA11), keratin,
  and type I cytoskeletal 14 (KRT14) are expressed in the proximal tubule, loop of
  Henle, the distal tubule, collecting duct, and deep medullary epithelium of pelvis,
  respectively. The numbers above the figure represent each nephron segment: 1, podocytes;
  2, parietal epithelium; 3, proximal tubule; 4, the loop of Henle; 5, distal tubule;
  6, nephron connecting tubule; 7, cortical collecting duct; 8, medullary collecting
  duct; 9, deep medullary epithelium of pelvis. Scale bars, 200 μm.'
