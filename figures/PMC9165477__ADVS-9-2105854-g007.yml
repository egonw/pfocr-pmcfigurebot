caption: dOMV@NPs penetrate the BBB through the OmpA‐gp96 interaction‐mediated transcellular
  vesicle transport pathway. a) Levels of claudin‐5 on bEND.3 BBB endothelial cells
  after stimulation with the indicated bacterial components (20 µg mL−1 protein or
  2.24 ng mL−1 LPS for 24 h) were analyzed by western blot. b) Paracellular penetration
  of 40 kDa FITC‐dextran (1 mg mL−1, 6 h incubation) across the in vitro BBB (which
  was prestimulated with the indicated bacterial components at 20 µg mL−1 protein
  or 2.24 ng mL−1 LPS for 12 h). c) Claudin‐5 expression on bEND.3 cells after stimulation
  with the indicated NPs (20 µg ml−1 protein for 24 h) was analyzed by western blot.
  d) Cellular uptake of the indicated DiR‐labeled NPs (1.5 µg DiR mL−1 for 6 h) by
  bEND.3 cells was measured by flow cytometry. e) gp96 on RAW264.7 macrophages and
  bEND.3 cells stimulated with either OmpA or dOMV was analyzed by western blot. f–h)
  Cellular uptake of doxorubicin‐labeled dOMV@NPs (5 µg doxorubicin mL−1 for 1.5 h)
  by bEND.3 cells in the presence of anti‐OmpA antibody (f), anti‐gp96 antibody (g),
  or the indicated endocytosis inhibitors (h) was measured by flow cytometry. i) Intracellular
  localization of dOMV@NPs (12 µg doxorubicin mL−1 for 1 h) after further incubation
  with fresh medium for different times, imaged using a confocal laser scanning microscope.
  Scale bar, 5 µm. j) Penetration of the indicated doxorubicin‐labeled NPs (5 µg doxorubicin
  mL−1 for 6 h) across the in vitro BBB. Error bars represent the SD (n = 3). ns (not
  significant), *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, one‐tailed unpaired t‐test.
