caption: Benzylisoquinoline alkaloid biosynthetic pathway in California poppy. California
  poppy produces diverse array of benzylisoquinoline type alkaloids (BIAs), which
  include benzophenanthridine alkaloids (such as sanguinarine, chelirubine, macarpine,
  chelerythrine, chelilutine), protopines (protopine, allocryptopine), aporphine alkaloids
  (magnoflorine, corydine, isoboldine), simple benzylisoquinolines (reticuline), pavine
  alkaloids (californidine, escholtzine), as well as the dihydro-intermediates. The
  broken lines indicate that the biosynthetic enzyme-encoding genes have not been
  identified. TAT, tyrosine aminotransferase; HPDC, p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate decarboxylase;
  PO, phenol oxidase; TDC, tyrosine/DOPA decarboxylase; NCS, (S)-norcoclaurine synthase;
  6OMT, (S)-norcoclaurine 6-O-methyltransferase; CNMT, (S)-coclaurine N-methyltransferase;
  MCH, (S)-N-methylcoclaurine 3’-hydroxylase; 4’OMT, (S)-3’-hydroxy-N-methylcoclaurine
  4’-O-methyltransferase; COS, (S)-corytuberine synthase; RNMT, (S)-reticuline N-methyltransferase;
  BBE, berberine bridge enzyme; SOMT, (S)-scoulerine 9-O-methyltransferase; CHS, (S)-cheilanthifoline
  synthase; STS, (S)-stylopine synthase; CAS, (S)-canadine synthase; TNMT, (S)-tetrahydroprotoberberine
  N-methyltransferase; MSH, (S)-N-methylstylopine 14-hydroxylase; P6H, protopine 6-hydroxylase;
  DBOX, dihydrobenzophenanthridine alkaloid oxidase; SR, sanguinarine reductase; DB10H,
  dihydrobenzophenanthridine alkaloid 10-hydroxylase; DB12H, dihydrobenzophenanthridine
  alkaloid 12-hydroxylase. Large arrows in red denote compounds synthesized in root
  and cultured cells, yellow indicates starting products of BIA synthesis, and green
  indicates alkaloids found in aerial part.
