caption: IMS system of CRC patients with distinct prognoses and therapeutic response(A)
  Graphical scheme describing the experimental workflow.(B) Graphical scheme describing
  the IMS method.(C) The volcano plot indicating the metabolism-related genes that
  were significantly associated with recurrence-free survival (RFS) of CRC as demonstrated
  by univariate Cox analysis.(D) The volcano plot indicating the immune-related genes
  that were significantly associated with RFS of CRC by univariate Cox analysis. Bar
  plot indicating the enriched biological process from gene ontology analysis.(F)
  Heatmap showing distinct metabolic-, immune-, and tumor microenvironment (TME)-related
  pathway activation in CRC tissues.(G) Consensus clustering identifying IMS groups
  in the training cohort (patients n = 1,399).(H) Bar plot indicating the proportion
  of each subtype in each cohort (left) and in the integrated training cohort (right).(I)
  Principal-component analysis (PCA) analysis showed the difference of the three metabolism
  subtypes.(J) Kaplan-Meier estimates of RFS for patients with different immunometabolism
  subtypes in the integrated training cohort.(K) Kaplan-Meier estimates of RFS for
  patients with different immunometabolism subtypes in a testing cohort (GSE28722
  n = 125).
