caption: 'Successful generation of Panc-1 TLR4 overexpressed stable cell line (Panc-1_TLR4OE)
  and BxPC-3 TLR4 knockout stable cell line (BxPC-3_TLR4KO), and the impacts of TLR4
  and PAUF expression on each other. Successful overexpression of TLR4 in Panc-1_TLR4OE
  cell line was confirmed by (A) immunofluorescence, (B) flow cytometry, and (C) Western
  blot (SDS-PAGE gel: 10%). Successful knockout of TLR4 by CRISPR/Cas9 was confirmed
  in BxPC-3_TLR4KO cells by (D) Cas9 mRNA expression and (E) Western blot (SDS-PAGE
  gel: 8%) against TLR4 in seven single clones with loss-of-function TLR4 mutations,
  which were pooled to form BxPC-3_TLR4KO cells. And the knockout of TLR4 in the pooled
  cells was confirmed by Western blot and shown in (C). (F) The correlation of TLR4
  and PAUF mRNA expression was analyzed using CCLE expression 22Q2 public data by
  Pearson correlation. (G) PAUF protein concentration in the four cell lines analyzed
  by sandwich ELISA. (H) Impacts of rPAUF (0, 0.1, 1, and 3 μg/mL) on TLR4 mRNA expression
  in Panc-1 and BxPC-3 cells. (I) Impacts of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0, 1, 5, and
  10 μg/mL) on TLR4 mRNA expression in Panc-1 and BxPC-3 cells (LPS was used here
  as a positive control of PAUF). The dose-dependency of TLR4 mRNA expression on rPAUF/LPS
  concentration was tested by Jonckheere-Terpstra test, after a significant multiple
  comparisons test (* p < 0.05, compared to control, obtained from one-way ANOVA and
  post-hoc multiple comparisons with Dunnett correction). All data are presented as
  mean ± SD from triplicate independent experiments.'
