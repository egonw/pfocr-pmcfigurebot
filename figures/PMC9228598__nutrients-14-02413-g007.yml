caption: 'Resveratrol (RSV) induces autophagy and apoptosis by targeting NGFR. Cells
  were transfected with siControl or siNGFR in the presence or absence of 80 μM RSV
  for 48 h. (A) Transcriptional expression of NGFR as determined by qRT-PCR. ACTB
  was used as an internal control; (B) Protein expression of NGFR as determined by
  Western blot. ACTB was used as an internal control; (C) QRT-PCR analysis of BECLIN
  1 mRNA. ACTB was used as an internal control; (D) AO (1 μg/mL) staining of autophagic
  vesicles. Fluorescence intensity was determined by flow cytometry (APC); (E) Transcriptional
  expression of BAX as determined by qRT-PCR. ACTB was used as an internal control;
  (F) TUNEL-FITC/PI staining was used to detect the percentage of apoptotic cells;
  (G) QRT-PCR analysis of BECLIN 1 mRNA. ACTB was used as an internal control; (H)
  AO (1 μg/mL) staining of autophagic vesicles. Fluorescence intensity was determined
  by flow cytometry (APC); (I) Transcriptional expression of BAX as determined by
  qRT-PCR. ACTB was used as an internal control; (J) TUNEL-FITC/PI staining was used
  to detect the percentage of apoptotic cells. The data are presented as mean ± SD
  from three independent experiments. * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 compared with the
  control group. # p  < 0.05 and ## p < 0.01 compared with siNGFR group.'
