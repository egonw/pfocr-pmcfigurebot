caption: Shh signaling promotes the proliferation of RA-FLS via the Rho/ROCK pathway.
  (a) RA-FLS were treated with purmorphamine, purmorphamine combined with Y27632,
  Y27632, or cyclopamine for 48 h. The cell proliferation rate was measured with a
  CCK8 assay. (b, c) RA-FLS were treated with purmorphamine, purmorphamine combined
  with Y27632, or cyclopamine for 48 h, and the proportion of cells in the S phase
  was detected by flow cytometry. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗∗p < 0.001.
