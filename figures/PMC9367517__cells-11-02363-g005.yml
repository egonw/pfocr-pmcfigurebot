caption: 'ENO2 induced YAP1 activation by suppressing its phosphorylation. (A): ENO2
  stimulates the Hippo pathway in SW480 cells. (B–D): The phosphorylation of YAP1
  Ser127 and the degradation of YAP1 were detected by Western blot after ENO2 knockdown.
  (E,F): IF assay showing ENO2 and YAP1 expression. Scale bar = 10 μm. YAP1 is stained
  red, ENO2 is stained green, and the nucleus is stained blue (DAPI). (G,H): Identification
  of YAP1 and ENO2 knockdown in RKO cells (G). Migration and invasion of RKO cells
  with YAP1 and ENO2 knockdown (H). (I,J): Identification of YAP1 and ENO2 knockdown
  in SW480 cells (I). Migration and invasion of SW480 cells with YAP1 and ENO2 knockdown
  (J). (K): The migration of DLD1 cells overexpressing ENO2 with YAP1 knockdown. Data
  are shown as the mean ± SD. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001. ns: non significance.'
