caption: Single treatments with HGF and U0126 induce a modulation of both epithelial
  and mesenchymal markers. U0126 + HGF treatment does not always restore the expression
  level to control values. (A,C,E,G) Western blot analyses of Snail, vimentin E-cadherin
  and N-cadherin in NT2D1 cell lines cultured in basal conditions (CTRL), with 5 µM
  U0126, with 40 ng/mL HGF, and with U0126 + HGF at 24 and 48 h (B,D,F,H). The densitometric
  analysis of the bands are reported for each protein (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; ***
  p < 0.001). Results are expressed in fold change, with the control considered as
  1 (± standard error of the mean (S.E.M.)). Four independent experiments were performed.
