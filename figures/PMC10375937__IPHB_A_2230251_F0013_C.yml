caption: The diagram shows the effects of AA on the LPS-induced MyD88-dependent TLR4
  signaling pathway in H9C2 myotubes (HCS and WB). the overall effect of AA on the
  LPS-stimulated MyD88-dependent The TLR4 signaling pathway is shown in the figure.
  The diagram shows how TLR4-downstream signaling was monitored in H2C9 in response
  to LPS stimulation using both HCS and WB analysis. HCS was applied to MyD88, NF-κB,
  p38, and JNK (immunocytochemistry). NF-κB, JNK, TLR4, MyD88, and NF-κB were all
  exposed to WB (Immunoblotting). Starting from the left, the groups are LPS (1 µg/mL),
  LPS(1 µg/mL) + PDTC (25 µM), LPS (1 µg/mL) +AA (50, 75 and 100 µM).
