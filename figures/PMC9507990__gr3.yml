caption: Activation of mTOR signaling pathway in MDSCs is involved in the occurrence
  of DPH (A) C57BL/6 mice (6–8 weeks old)(n = 11/group) received a single intraperitoneal
  injection of 0.5 ml pristane for 14 days to establish the DPH mouse model. Expression
  of p-4EBP, 4EBP1, p-S6, and S6 in MDSCs isolated from control and DPH mice spleen
  was detected by Western blot. (B) The density quantification of band intensities.
  (C) C57BL/6 mice (6–8 weeks old) (n = 11/group) received a single intraperitoneal
  injection of 0.5 ml pristane for 14 days, and metformin, INK128, and Rapamycin during
  induction. The lung tissues were observed for evaluating the symptoms of diffuse
  pulmonary hemorrhage, and statistical analysis of the proportion of three types
  of pulmonary hemorrhage symptoms in each group. (D) Morphological analysis of spleens
  of mice in different groups.
