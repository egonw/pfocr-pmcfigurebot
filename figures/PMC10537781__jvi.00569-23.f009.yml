caption: Schematic diagram for the mechanism by which the ASFV I10L protein suppresses
  the host cell proinflammatory responses. The ASFV pI10L can inhibit the TNF-α- and
  IL-1β-triggered inflammatory responses by targeting IKKβ. pI10L inhibits the phosphorylation
  of IKKβ by reducing the K63-linked ubiquitination of NEMO and hinders the association
  of IKKβ with its substrates IκBα and p65, leading to reduced phosphorylation of
  IκBα and p65, as well as the nuclear translocation of p65, and subsequently the
  expression of proinflammatory cytokines.
