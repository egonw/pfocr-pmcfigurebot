caption: Mechanism of lncRNAs in osteoarthritis. In IL-1β-induced OA model, overexpression
  of lncRNA HOTAIR promotes the expression of MMPs and exacerbates OA. Overexpression
  of lncRNA HOTAIR increases the activity of Wnt/β-catenin pathway by regulating miR-17-5p/FUT2
  axis, which aggravates the injury and apoptosis of chondrocytes. Overexpression
  of lncRNA OIP5-ASI inhibits apoptosis and inflammation by targeting miR-29b-3p/PGRN.
  Emodin inhibits the Notch/NF-κB pathway by upregulating lncRNA TUG1, which alleviates
  the apoptotic and inflammatory response of chondrocytes. LncRNA ARFRP1 is significantly
  upregulated in LPS-induced chondrocytes, and the downregulation of lncRNA ARFRP1
  inhibits activation of NF-κB signaling pathway by targeting miR-15a-5p/TLR4 axis.
  Knockdown of lncRNA FOXD2-AS1 alleviates inflammatory injury by regulating the miR-27a-3p/TLR4
  axis.
