caption: 'Cross-talk between MAPK and mTOR signaling pathways. Schematic representation
  of MAPK and mTOR signaling pathways upon growth factor activation. Arrows represent
  activation, while t-shaped lines represent inhibition. Black lines depict signaling
  within a pathway. Red lines depict crosstalk between signaling pathways. TSC1/2:
  tuberous sclerosis 1/2; 4EBP1: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding
  protein 1; P: phosphorylation; pS6: phosphorylated S6; GDP: guanosine diphosphate;
  GTP: guanosine triphosphate'
