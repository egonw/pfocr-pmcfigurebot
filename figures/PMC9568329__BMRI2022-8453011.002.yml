caption: 'RES regulated the expression of Gli1, SMO, Shh, Bax, and Bcl-2 in HeLa cells.
  Cells were treated with or without RES for 24 h; the qPCR and western blotting were
  performed to analyzed the expression of Hedgehog signaling pathway-related genes
  (SMO, Gli1, and Shh (a and b)) and apoptotic-related genes (Bax and Bcl-2 (c and
  d)) in the HeLa cells. All date was from 3 independent experiments (∗p < 0.05, t-test).
  Ctrl: HeLa cells were treated with DMSO; RES: HeLa cells were treated with RES.'
