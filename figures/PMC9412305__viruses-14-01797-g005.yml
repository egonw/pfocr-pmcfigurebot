caption: Apoptotic caspases block IFN production through cleavage of pathway components.
  Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) leads to the release of mtDNA
  as well as mtRNA that can be sensed by the cGAS/STING and MDA5/MAVS pathways, respectively,
  leading to Type I IFN production. Caspase activation resulting from MOMP blocks
  the IFN response by cleavage of various components of the cGAS/STING and RLR-MAVS
  signaling pathway. Activation of apoptotic caspase also suppresses IFN expression
  due to RNA and DNA virus infection (not shown). Created with BioRender.com (accessed
