caption: Schematic representation for the vector construction, histochemical staining,
  and fluorometric assay. (A) Promoter-GUS expression constructs showed the schematic
  structure. P(0); negative control; P(35S); positive control, and VvPR1 promoter
  in the forward orientation, respectively. (B) Histochemical staining analysis; GUS
  activity in transiently transformed N. benthamiana leaves with serially deleted
  VvPR1 promoter fragments (−1837, −1,443, −1,119, −845, −558, −436, and −192) bp
  against SA. (C) Fluorometric assay of VvPR1 promoter fragments (−1837, −1,443, −1,119,
  −845, −558, −436, and −192) bp in response to SA in tobacco leaves through transient
  expression. Different letters on the bars showed a significant difference between
  SA-treated fragments and the control according to the least significant difference
  (LSD) test (p < 0.05).
