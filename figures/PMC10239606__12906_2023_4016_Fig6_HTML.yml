caption: MOS reduces CSC marker and pluripotency transcription factor. (A) A549 and
  H23 cells were treated with 5 µM of RES or MOS for 24 h. The expression levels CD133
  and p-Akt were determined using anti-CD133 and anti-p-Akt (Ser473) antibody followed
  by Alexa Fluor 488-labeled secondary antibody or Alexa Fluor 594-labeled secondary
  antibody and Hoechst 33342. The expression was visualized by fluorescence microscopy.
  (B) Bar graphs showed the quantitative results of A. (C) A549 and H23 cells were
  treated with MOS (0–5 µM) for 24 h, the levels of CD133, Sox2, p-Akt, total Akt,
  p-GSK-3β, total GSK-3β, and c-Myc were examined by Western blot analysis. β-actin
  was utilized as a loading control. The original image of blotting bands was shown
  in Additional file . (D) Bar graphs showed the quantitative results of C. Each value
  is the mean (± SD) from triplicate experiments. *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 vs. control
