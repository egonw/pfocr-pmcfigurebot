caption: Molecular targets to decrease oxidative damage during I-R. (1) One of the
  main points to reduce oxidative damage is the NrF2 factor, the starting point of
  the NrF2/HO-1 signaling pathway that triggers ROS blockade. (2) Nitric oxide synthase,
  being blocked, can prevent the activation of the inflammatory cascade. (3) Low oxygen
  concentrations in the cell lead to the activation of HIF1 and HIF 1α/VEGF, one of
  the primary mechanisms for generating new vasculature. (4) DPP4s decrease oxidative
  stress when their expression increases. (5) In addition, mitochondrial DNA can function
  as a signaling mechanism that allows the activation of programs to block the production
  of reactive oxygen species.
