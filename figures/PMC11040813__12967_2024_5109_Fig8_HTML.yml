caption: LETM2 exerts pro-carcinogenic effects by activating the MTOR pathway. A Western
  Blot assay to detect changes in the MTOR pathway after overexpression of LETM2.
  B Western Blot assay to detect changes in the MTOR pathway after treatment with
  rapamycin. C ATP proliferation rate assay to detect the effect of treatment with
  rapamycin on AGS cell proliferation. D ATP proliferation rate assay to detect the
  effect of rapamycin treatment on the proliferation of SGC7901 cells. E soft agar
  assay to detect the effect of treatment with rapamycin on the anchorage-independent
  growth capacity of AGS cells. F soft agar assay to detect the effect of treatment
  with rapamycin on the anchorage-independent growth capacity of SGC7901 cells G plate
  cloning assay to detect the effect of treatment with rapamycin on the proliferation
  of AGS cells. H Plate cloning assay to detect the effect of treatment with rapamycin
  on the proliferation of SGC7901 cells
