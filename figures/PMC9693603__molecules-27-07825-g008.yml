caption: Effect of azilsartan on the expression of MMP9, phosphorylated STAT3, total
  STAT3, JAK2, IL6 and cleaved caspase proteins in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cancer cell
  lines. (A) Representative western blots of MMP9, phosphorylated STAT3, total STAT3,
  JAK2, IL6 and cleaved caspase proteins in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with
  the IC50 concentration of azilsartan for 48 h. β-actin was used as internal loading
  control. (B) Expression of proteins in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 treated cells were expressed
  relative to untreated cells after normalization to the corresponding β-actin protein
  expression. Bars represent mean ± SD, n = 3. Significant difference was analyzed
  by two-way ANOVA test, where ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, compared to untreated cells.
