caption: Effects of tetrandrine on the expression levels of IgA receptor protein in
  HRMCs. Cells were treated with 2 μM of tetrandrine in the presence or absence of
  deS/deGal IgA for 48 h. The cell lysates were examined by Western blot. More than
  three independent experiments were carried out and representative results were shown
  in the figures. β-actin was used as internal control. Statistical analyses were
  performed using Bonferroni’s multiple comparison tests, **p < 0.01 and ****p < 0.0001
  respectively. (n = 6).
article_title: Tetrandrine inhibits the proliferation of mesangial cells induced by
  enzymatically deglycosylated human IgA1 via IgA receptor/MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway.
