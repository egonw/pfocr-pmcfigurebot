caption: rNfCB induces the production of diverse cytokines/chemokines in BV-2 microglial
  cells. (a) Cytokine array assay. BV-2 microglial cells were stimulated with rNfCB
  (100 µg/mL). The culture supernatants were harvested and subjected to cytokine array
  analysis. The culture supernatant from rNfCB-untreated BV-2 microglial cells was
  used as a negative control (NC). Each cytokine or chemokine is represented as double
  dots. PC is a positive reference control to verify the reaction. (b) Quantitative
  analysis. The density of dots corresponding to each cytokine or chemokine was analyzed
  quantitatively, and the value was presented as mean ± SD. One-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s
  post hoc test was performed as multiple comparisons. *** p < 0.0001, ** p < 0.001,
  * p < 0.01.
