caption: Nestin maintains high transfer capability of CRC cells. (A,B) Transwell assay
  results of cell migration (A) and invasion (B) in CRC cells transfected with nestin
  siRNAs or NC. Cells were stained with crystal violet (200×). (C) The formation of
  spheres was assessed by sphere formation analysis (40×). (D,E) RT-qPCR (D) and Western
  blot (E) measurement of Oct4 and Sox2 expression. ***, P<0.001 vs. NC. n=3. RT-qPCR,
  quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; CRC, colorectal cancer;
  NC, negative control.
