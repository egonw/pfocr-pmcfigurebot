caption: GSEA analysis of single cells from 4T1 mice. (A) Volcano plot showing DEGs
  between the mice treated with PTX+CKI and saline. (B) Volcano plot showing DEGs
  between the mice treated with PTX+CKI and PTX. The red dot represents up-regulated
  genes (adjusted P < 0.01 and log2FC > 0.25) and the green dot represents down-regulated
  genes (adjusted P < 0.01 and log2FC < -0.25). (C) Venn plot showing consistently
  down-regulated DEGs. (D) Venn plot showing consistently up-regulated DEGs. (E) Immune-related
  KEGG pathways enriched in the PTX+CKI group compared with the PTX group. (F) T cell
  receptor signaling pathway enriched in the PTX+CKI group compared with the PTX group.
  (G) Immune-related GO biological processes enriched in the PTX+CKI group compared
  with the PTX group. (H) Positive regulation of immune response enriched in the PTX+CKI
  group compared with the PTX group. (I) Positive regulation of T cell activation
  enriched in the PTX+CKI group compared with the PTX group.
