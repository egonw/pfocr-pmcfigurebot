caption: GUN4 and bilin in Chl biosynthesis. A) Heme, Chl, and cobamides such as vitamin
  B12 are synthesized via a common tetrapyrrole trunk pathway (). Incorporation of
  iron into PPIX by FC produces heme and also provides a precursor for synthesis of
  bilins such as PCB. Incorporation of magnesium into PPIX by MgCh is the first committed
  step in Chl biosynthesis, producing Mg•protoporphyrin IX (Mg•proto). In oxygenic
  photosynthetic organisms, MgCh function is stimulated by GUN4 protein, which can
  bind PCB (dashed line). The equivalent step in cobamide biosynthesis is cobalt chelation
  by CoCh. In the aerobic pathway for cobamide synthesis, CoCh is composed of three
  subunits including a substrate-binding CobN subunit homologous to the substrate-binding
  subunit CHLH in MgCh. B) The structure of GUN4 from Synechocystis sp. strain PCC
  6803 is shown with bound PCB (PDB accession 7E2T; ()). The PCB ligand and a conserved
  LxNxLR motif are indicated.
