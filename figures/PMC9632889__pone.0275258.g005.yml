figure_title: Leonurine reduced the expression of proteins related to pyroptosis in
  heart tissues from rats with ISO-induced heart failure
caption: '(A) Compared to ISO-induced rats, leonurine decreased expressions of pyroptosis
  proteins including (B) GSDMD, (C) cleaved GSDMD, (D) Caspase 1, (E) cleaved Caspase
  1, and the level of (F) IL-1β in plasma. #P<0.05, ##P<0.01, ###P<0.001, model group
  vs. control group; *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, leonurine groups vs. model group.'
article_title: Leonurine inhibits cardiomyocyte pyroptosis to attenuate cardiac fibrosis
  via the TGF-β/Smad2 signalling pathway.
