caption: The summary of pathway analysis in the serum of realgar-exposed mice compared
  with control mice. Each circle represents one metabolic pathway; the size of circle
  shows the positive correlation with the impact of each pathway; the colour of circle
  denotes the significance from the highest value in red to the lowest value in white.
  (1) Valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis; (2) synthesis and degradation
  of ketone bodies; (3) glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism; (4) pyruvate metabolism;
  (5) citrate cycle; (6) glycolysis or gluconeogenesis; (7) butanoate metabolism.
