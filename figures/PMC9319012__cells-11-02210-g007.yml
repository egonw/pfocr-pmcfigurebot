caption: OGG1 is required for RSV-induced GFPT2 expression. (A) hSAECs were treated
  with solvent (DMSO) or TH5487 and mock- or RSV-infected as indicated. Cells were
  stained with anti-GFPT2 Ab (red) and nuclei by DAPI (blue). Bar indicates 30 μm.
  (B) The quantitation of GFPT2 staining. GFPT2 fluorescence was segmented by StarDist
  and plotted as arbitrary fluorescence/cell for each treatment condition. **, p <
  0.01 by post-hoc Tukey comparison.
