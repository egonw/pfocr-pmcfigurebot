caption: Gene set enrichment analysis of sexually dimorphic genes demonstrates enrichment
  for immunological pathways in females but not males. (A) GSEA conducted on female
  sexually dimorphic genes with greater than 2.5-fold upregulation. Arrows indicate
  immunological pathway upregulation for antigen processing and presentation (P <
  .008 false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.61) and chemokine response (P < .008 FDR = 0.67).
  (B) GSEA conducted on male sexually dimorphic genes with greater than 2.5-fold upregulation.
  Arrows indicate upregulation for cellular process in reproduction (P < .0001 FDR
  < 0.05) and fertilization (P < .0001 FDR < 0.05). (C) Whole chromosome landscape
  density plot of sexually dimorphic gene sets for males (outside of circle) in red
  and females (inside of circle) in blue. (D) Histogram showing the percent of sexually
  dimorphic genes that reside on each chromosome across both males and females.
