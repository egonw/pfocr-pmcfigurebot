figure_title: Schematic illustration of the mechanisms that tumor-derived Igs promoted
  tumor cell growth and proliferation
caption: Tumor-derived Igs augmented multiple tumor cell growth and proliferation
  through positively or negatively regulating the following cell signaling pathways
  or biological processes or important molecules, including MAPK/ERK signaling pathway,
  MAPK/p38 signaling pathway, TLR4 signaling pathway, MEK/ERK/c-Myc signaling pathway,
  caspase-dependent signaling pathway, apoptosis, cell cycle, ATPase, and proliferation
  markers. Tumor-derived IgG specifically recognized by RP215 promoted cancer (breast
  cancer and LSCC) cell proliferation.
