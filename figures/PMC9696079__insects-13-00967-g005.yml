caption: Verification of DEGs expression by qRT-PCR. (A) Verification of DEGs in glutathione
  metabolism pathway; (B) the expression of glutathione transferase Delta2 in each
  tissue was specifically decreased in the posterior silk gland; (C) verification
  of DEGs in tyrosine metabolism pathway; (D) verification of DEGs in the biosynthesis
  of amino acids pathway. Standard deviation was calculated by all biological replicates.
  * p < 0.01, ** p < 0.005, *** p < 0.001, t test, each group had three biological
  replicates.
