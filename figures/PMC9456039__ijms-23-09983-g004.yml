caption: 'Involvement of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in the protective activity
  of zonisamide against OHP-induced neurotoxicity: (a) Preincubation with 100 μM zonisamide
  for 1 h tended to upregulate the expression of phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) in naïve
  ND7/23 cells, but not in the cells incubated with 75 μM of OHP for 1 h; results
  referring to Western blotting. (b) Co-incubation with 25 μM of LY294002 (a PI3K
  inhibitor) weakens the alleviating effects of zonisamide (100 μM) against the OHP-induced
  (75 μM) cell death. Data are presented as the mean ± SD of 11 experiments; **: p
  < 0.01; *: p < 0.05 (as defined by Tukey–Kramer).'
