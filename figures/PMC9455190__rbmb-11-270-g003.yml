caption: PLC and PI3K pathway knockdown reduced the decline of PtdIns(4,5)P2 during
  FA disassembly and slow down the rate of FA turnover. A-F) The decline of PtdIns(4,5)P2
  was significantly reduced by PLC and PI3K inhibitors for 30 minutes, comparedthe
  PLC U-73343 and LY 303511 inactive analogues that was used as a control at the same
  dose and time. This data was resulted from 40 representative FA intensity profiles
  per cell. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's test
  for multiple comparison. Statistical significance was accepted at *** p< 0.0005.
  Data represents meanÂ±SD of the three independent experiments.
