caption: Anti-inflammatory effects of SHYS on DKD model rats. The anti-inflammatory
  effects of SHYS on DKD were evaluated by investigating the levels of proinflammatory
  cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) in renal tissue homogenates using ELISA. (a)–(c)
  SHYS treatment decreased the levels of IL-1β (a), IL-6 (b), and TNF-α (c) in renal
  tissue homogenates in DKD model rats.
