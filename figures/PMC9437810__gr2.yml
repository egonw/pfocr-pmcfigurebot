caption: Changes associated with RNA regulatory proteins and RNA-binding proteins
  on the gene-level data(A) GO pathway enrichments associated with RNA regulatory
  proteins identified in BE.LGD versus BE.HGD and BE.LGD TP53 WT versus BE.HGD TP53
  MUT (p-value ≤ 0.05 and FDR ≤0.25). Pathways are colored and ranked by FDR. (B)
  Heatmap of the leading-edge genes identified in select pathways in the GO pathway
  enrichment analysis. Dot plot on the right shows the pathways that the gene belongs.
  (C) Volcano plot of the expression of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in BE.LGD versus
  BE.HGD. (D) Volcano plot of the expression of RBPs in BE.LGD TP53 WT versus BE.HGD
  TP53 MUT. Red dot represents significantly differentially expressed RBPs (|log2FC| > 0.585
  and FDR ≤0.05). Gene names of the genes that interact with isoform-switched genes
  predicted by the STRING database are shown.
