caption: 'NF-κB signaling and autophagy are significantly impacted by Exoc5 ablation
  in the developing mouse ureter. (A) Gene-expression profiling of total ureter RNA
  from control and Exoc5 CKO mice at E16.5 (n=3 for each group). Volcano plot displaying
  the gene expression analysis shows uroplakin genes as being significantly downregulated
  (red) and the NF-κB signaling mediator Fn14 gene (Tnfrsf12a) as significantly upregulated
  (green). (B) NF-κB signaling was among the most upregulated pathways identified
  by KEGG Pathway Analysis. (C) Real-time qPCR confirmed Upk3 downregulation and Fn14
  upregulation in Exoc5 CKO E16.5 ureters. In addition, gene expression of the cytokine
  TWEAK was significantly upregulated along with that of its receptor Fn14 (two-tailed
  unpaired t-test). (D) Western blot analysis of Exoc5 CKO ureters showed robust expression
  of Fn14 at E17.5 compared to control ureters or even Exoc5 at E16.5. β-actin (BACT)
  was used as a loading control. (E) Quantification of Fn14 detected by western blots
  in E16.5 control, E16.5 Exoc5 CKO, E17.5 control and E17.5 Exoc5 CKO ureters (n=14,
  14, 11 and 14, respectively), with each dot representing a mouse (two-way ANOVA
  and Tukey''s post hoc test). (F) Immunohistochemistry of E17.5 control and Exoc5
  CKO ureters shows Fn14 localization to the urothelial cells surrounding the ureter
  lumen. (G) KEGG pathway analysis of the most downregulated pathways indicated broad
  metabolic disruption. (H) Immunohistochemistry of E17.5 control and Exoc5 CKO ureters
  displayed differences in LC3 distribution and the onset of LC3 puncta formation
  (red, arrow). As expected, uroplakin-3 staining (green) shows that control ureters
  had stratified by this timepoint, but Exoc5 CKO ureters had not. (I) Higher magnification
  of the accumulation of LC3 in the E17.5 Exoc5 CKO ureter. Data show the mean±s.d.
