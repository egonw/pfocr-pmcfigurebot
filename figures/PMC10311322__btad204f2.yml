caption: '(A) Cross-validation performance of COmic models compared to previously
  published methods. The boxplots show the 10 mean auROC validation scores of a 10-times
  repeated 10-fold cross-validation over each of the 6 breast cancer cohorts. Performance
  of COmic models is shown in orange (last two boxes on the right side). The center
  line of each box indicates the median. The height of the boxes represents the interquartile
  range (IQR) with the upper and lower whiskers set to 1.5 times the IQR. Outliers
  are depicted by black diamonds. Notches represent the confidence interval (CI) around
  the median and were calculated using bootstrapping with 10 000 iterations. (B) Visualizing
  the global interpretation capabilities of a pooling-based COmic model. Each box
  represents one of the 50 pathways and was created using the pathway weights of the
  models trained on the six publicly available breast cancer cohorts: GSE11121, GSE1456,
  GSE2034, GSE2990, GSE4922, and GSE7390. The boxplots are defined as in (A) but without
  notches (CIs not shown). (C) Visualizing the local interpretation capabilities of
  an attention-based COmic model. Each heat-map shows the attention weights for each
  of the 50 pathways for three different patients. The model was trained on the GSE11121
  cohort. Patient 1 was correctly classified to have a metastasis-free survival (DMFS)
  above 5 years. Patient 2 was correctly classified to have a DMFS below 5 years.
  Patient 3 was wrongly classified to have a DMFS above 5 years, while the DMFS of
  Patient 3 was actually below 5 years. More examples can be found in the supplement.
  (D) Mean training time of pooling-based and attention-based COmic models for differently
  sized datasets. The number of samples is 100, 1000, 10 000, and 100 000, respectively.
  Training was repeated five times per dataset and the stars represent the mean training
  time. The blue and green lines show the results for a fixed batch size of 32 samples
  per batch. The red and yellow lines show the results for an adaptive batch size
  of 1% of the dataset size (i.e. the batch size was 1 for the dataset with 100 samples
  and 1000 for the dataset with 100 000 samples). Each model was trained for 200 epochs.'
