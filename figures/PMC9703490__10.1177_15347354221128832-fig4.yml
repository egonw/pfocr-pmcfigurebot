caption: Cell viability of A549 (A) and L-132 (B) cell lines after 24 hours of treatment
  of EELDP (0-0.6 mg/ml). (C) represents cell viability of A549 cells after 24 hours
  of treatment of F6 and F8 (0-100 µg/ml). DMSO was used as the negative control.
  Each bar shows the mean with the standard deviation of % cell viability calculated
  from 5 different experiments. Here “*” defines 0.01 < P ≤ 0.05, “**” defines 0.001 < P ≤ 0.01,
  and “***” defines P ≤ 0.001.
