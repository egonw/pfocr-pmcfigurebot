caption: Individual assessment of NRGPI genes and association with necroptosis. (A)
  Spearman’s correlation between NRGPI genes and infiltration of macrophages in the
  TCGA STAD dataset assessed with TIMER database. (B) Spearman’s correlation between
  NRGPI genes and KEGG TGF-β signaling pathway signature genes and (C) WNT signaling
  pathway signature genes. (D) mRNA expression level of RIPK1, RIPK3, MLKL (necroptosis
  core mediators), NRGPI oncogenes (SERPINE1, GPX3, GRP, FCN1, CYTL1, CNTN1, PLCL1,
  and APOD), and markers of WNT signaling pathway (WNT2B, WNT9A) and TGF- signaling
  pathway (TGFB1, TGFB3) in gastric cancer cells (AGS and MNK45) after being treated
  with a combination of human recombinant TNF-α, SMAC mimetic, and zVAD-FMK (TSZ)
  to induce necroptosis or added necroptosis inhibitor (necrostatin-1) to inhibit
  necroptosis. Graph shows mean ± SD. *P<0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001;
  ns, not signficant.
