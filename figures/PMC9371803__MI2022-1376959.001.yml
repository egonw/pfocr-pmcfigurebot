caption: The effects of HMGA2 on neuron function and brain injury in cerebral infarction
  rats. (a) Quantitative PCR was performed to examine the mRNA expression level of
  HMGA2. (b) Western blot was used to explore the protein expression level of HMGA2.
  (c) Cerebral tissue water content after cerebral infarction compared. (d) Neurological
  severity scores were evaluated the neuron function. (e) TTC staining was used to
  explore the infarct volumes after MCAO. (f) H&E staining to analysis the brain tissue
  sections in cerebral infarction rats. ∗∗p < 0.01 vs. sham or MCAO + sh-NC. ∗p <
  0.05 vs. sham or MCAO + sh-NC. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM.
