caption: 'Mechanism of combination immunotherapy in the treatment of immune “cold”
  tumors. (a) Microenvironment of an immune “cold” tumor before immunotherapy: less
  inflammatory cell infiltration and less lethal. (b) Changes of the TME after the
  combination of DCs tumor vaccine and ICIs inhibitor in the treatment of immune “cold”
  tumors: DCs tumor vaccine can enhance T cell infiltration, and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors
  can block the activation of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway and prevent T cell inactivation.'
