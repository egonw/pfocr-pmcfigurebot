caption: Effect of AWGP and KCWGP on mitochondrial biogenesis in C2C12 myotubes. C2C12
  myoblasts were differentiated into myotubes for 5 days and then treated with AWGP
  or KCWGP (0.1, 1 or 2 mg/ml) or with metformin (2.5 mM) for 45 min. (A) The expressions
  of PGC1α, Sirt-1, NRF-1 and TFAM proteins were analyzed by western blotting. (B)
  The density of each target was calculated with the expression of β-actin. The values
  from the triplicate of experiments are given as the mean ± standard error of mean.
  *P<0.05 vs. untreated cells (N). AWGP, American wild ginseng pharmacopuncture; KCWGP,
  Korean cultivated wild ginseng pharmacopuncture; PGC1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor-γ coactivator-1-α; Sirt-1, Sirtuin 1; NRF-1, nuclear respiratory factor-1;
  TFAM, mitochondrial transcription factor A; M, metformin-treated cells; N, untreated
  cells.

  AMPK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.
