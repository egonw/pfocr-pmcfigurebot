caption: ucOCN inhibits the phosphorylation of TNF-α–mediated transcription factors.
  (A-C) C2C12 cells were treated with 10 ng/mL TNF-α and/or 0.5 ng/mL ucOCN for 1,
  10, and 30 minutes. The extracted whole lysate was subjected to Western blot and
  analyzed using the anti-ERK antibody, anti-phospho-ERK antibody, anti-p38 MAPK antibody,
  anti-phospho-p38 MAPK antibody, anti-JNK antibody, or anti-phospho-JNK antibody.
  The blots were stripped and re-probed to visualize different proteins. (D) Quantification
  of the Western blot bands.
