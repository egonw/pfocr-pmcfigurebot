figure_title: mRNA expression of EMT-associated genes potentially affected by PARD6A
  expression
caption: mRNA expression of EMT-associated genes in SKOV3 (A) and A2780 cells (B)
  with PARD6A silenced. mRNA expression of EMT-associated genes in HO8910 (C) and
  OVCAR8 cells (D) with PARD6A overexpressed. Data shown are the mean values (±SD)
  from three independent experiments and relative values of mRNA expression of the
  genes when expression of PARD6A manipulated versus the expression of them when transfected
  with siControls. Statistically significant differences with P < 0.05 were considered
  significant (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001).
