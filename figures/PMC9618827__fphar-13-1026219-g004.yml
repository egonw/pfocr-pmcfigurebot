caption: Signaling pathways of Fuzi cardiotoxicity. Aconitine can not only lead to
  Ion overload, but also increase ROS content, leading to oxidative stress. It also
  activates mitochondria mediated apoptosis pathway by regulating PGC-1Î± content.
  It induces cardiomyocyte inflammation leading to apoptosis by activating NLRP3/ASC/caspase-3
  signaling pathway.
