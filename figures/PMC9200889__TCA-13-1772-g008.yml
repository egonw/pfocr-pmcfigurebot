caption: ACT001 induced G1/S arrest in non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines.
  (a) The bubble chart shows the up‐/downregulation pathway of ACT001 treatment after
  analyzing the RNA‐Seq database. (b) Cell cycle analysis. Results of cell cycle analysis
  were obtained for the H1703 and H1975 cell lines with ACT001.The percentages of
  G1, S, and G2/M phase cells were analyzed. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 and
  ****p < 0.0001. (c) Western blot analysis of cyclin D1 and CDK6 in H1703 and H1975
  cell lines after treatment with different concentrations of ACT001
article_title: ACT001 inhibits the proliferation of non‐small cell lung cancer cells
  by upregulating NKTR expression.
