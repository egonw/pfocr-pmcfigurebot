caption: Concerted expression and action of Wisper and NOTCH1 signaling on cardiac
  fibrosis and new myocyte formation. (A) Experimental protocol. Tamoxifen-treated
  (5 consecutive days) Myh6-MerCreMer;ROSA26-mTmG reporter mice were subjected to
  transaortic constriction or Sham operation and 2 and 9 days post-surgery, they received
  Wisper-GapmeR or Control (Cont.)-GapmeR. Two weeks after TAC, they were treated
  twice with αNRR1 antibody at 4 days interval or left untreated (None). The hearts
  were harvested 4 weeks after TAC and analyzed. (B) Masson Trichrome of heart tissue
  sections showing collagen deposition (blue). (C) Quantitative analysis of cardiac
  fibrosis expressed as percent of whole-heart sectional area. (D,E) Wisper knockdown
  stimulates formation of new CMs. (D) Fluorescence photomicrograph of a whole heart
  section showing tdT+ CMs in the endocardium and myocardium regions. The areas within
  squares are displayed at higher magnifications demonstrating the presence of α-actinin+
  (gray), tdT+ CMs (red) in the endocardium (a) and myocardium (b) in contact with
  pre-existing EGFP+ CMs (green). (E) Quantification of new tdT+ CM formation expressed
  as percent of total number of CMs per whole heart tissue section. The graphs in
  (E) show mean ± SEM. *, p < 0.05 in TAC vs. Sham; †, p < 0.05 in Wisper-GapmeR vs.
  Control-GapmeR; ‡, p < 0.05 in αNRR1 vs. None and n.s., not significant (Sham Control-GapmeR
  αNRR1, n = 3; Sham Wisper-GapmeR αNRR1, n = 3; TAC Control-GapmeR αNRR1, n = 5;
  TAC Control-GapmeR None, n = 3; TAC-Control-GapmeR αNRR1, n = 6; TAC Wisper-GapmeR
  None, n = 6; TAC Wisper-GapmeR αNRR1, n = 7). Scale bars in (B) = 100 μm; in (D)
