caption: 'Ligand diffusion regulates cell adhesion in an actomyosin force‐independent
  manner. a) Scheme of the working principle of diffusible monolayer polymer coatings.
  b) Representative images of FRAP measurement of fluorescence‐labeled ligands with
  different mobility. c) Representative images of cells after treatment with α5β1
  or αvβ3 integrin antibodies for 4 h (Red: F‐actin). d) The distinct signaling pathways
  for cells on ligand diffusible surfaces. Specifically, the fast ligand diffusion
  enables cell to recruit α5β1 integrin, activating α5β1 integrin and initiating Rac
  and RhoA signaling to promote cell adhesion but not osteogenesis. Whereas the slow/constant
  ligand diffusion surface provide larger cell tractions. It can activate myosin II
  and the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway, resulting in an enhanced cell spreading and
  osteogenesis. Reproduced with permission.[] Copyright 2020, Wiley‐VCH.'
