caption: YAP is downregulated during UVB‐induced skin injury. (A) The expression levels
  of YAP, Cyr61, CTGF, Cyclin A1 in the HaCaT subjected to untreated or UVB‐irradiated
  (n = 3). β‐Actin was used as a loading control. (B–E) Quantification of YAP, Cyr61,
  CTGF, Cyclin A1 levels in (A). (F–H) The mRNA levels of YAP, Cyr61, Cyclin E1 were
  quantified by quantitative real‐time PCR (qRT‐PCR) in untreated or UVB treated HaCaT
  (n = 3). (I) Protein expression levels of YAP, Cyr61, CTGF, Cyclin E1 in the skin
  tissues subjected to untreated or UVB‐irradiated. (J–M) Quantification of YAP, Cyr61,
  CTGF, Cyclin A1 levels in (I). (N) Representative IHC staining of YAP in the epidermal
  of skin after untreated or UVB‐irradiated (n = 3). Scale bars = 100 μm. (O) Quantification
  the percentage of YAP‐positive cells from (N). (P) Western blot analysis the subcellular
  localization of YAP in untreated or UVB treated HaCaT (n = 3). The data are presented
  as the means ± SEM. ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01, vs. the corresponding untreated group
