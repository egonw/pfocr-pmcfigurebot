figure_title: Synthetic pathway to phos-EAR molecule
caption: a Schematic illustration of synthesis of the receptor molecules, starting
  from 3-nitro-4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, to the synthesis of a modular receptor scaffold
  3, to the phosphatase-specific enzyme-activating receptor 9 (Phos-EAR). PG = protecting
  group b HRMS data illustrating deprotection of the benzyl-protected compound 7 using
  TFA or trimethylsilyl bromide (TMSBr), and an allyl-protected 7 through Pd-catalyzed
  deallylation. For detailed reaction conditions, see Supplemental Methods.
