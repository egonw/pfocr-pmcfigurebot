caption: HOTAIR recruits PRC2 complex onto IκBα promoter to inhibit the gene expression
  and negatively correlates with IκBα expression in clinical samples.A, ChIP-quantitative
  PCR analysis was performed for the detection of EZH2 and H3K27me3 binding site in
  IκBα promoter after HOTAIR knockdown. Data are shown as means±SD. B, the indicated
  genes were subjected to the expression analysis by Western blotting after EZH2 or
  HOTAIR knockdown. β-actin was used as an internal control. C, IκBα promoter were
  constructed into pGL4.18 vector and subjected to luciferase reporter assays after
  EZH2 or HOTAIR knockdown. D, NF-κB reporter plasmid was transfected into cells upon
  knockdown EZH2 or HOTAIR and luciferase activity was measured. E, the indicated
  genes were subjected to the expression analysis by Western blotting after EZH2-WT
  cDNA or EZH2-H694A cDNA transfection. β-actin was used as an internal control. F,
  ChIP-quantitative PCR analysis was performed for the detection of H3K27 histone
  triple-methylation–binding site within the IκBα promoter. Data are shown as means±SD.
  G, HOTAIR was detected in breast tumor tissues (n = 1084) and adjacent normal tissues
  (n = 291). The data was analyzed from GEPIA database. H, IκBα was detected in breast
  tumor tissues (n = 1084) and adjacent normal tissues (n = 289). The data was analyzed
  from GEPIA database. I, the survival rate of breast cancer patients with high or
  low HOTAIR expression was analyzed. J, a model describes how HOTAIR regulates the
  stemness of breast cancer cells. cDNA, complementary DNA; EZH2, enhancer of zeste
  homolog 2; H3K27me3, histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation; HOTAIR, Hox transcript
  antisense intergenic RNA; NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappa B; PRC2, polycomb repressive
  complex 2 (∗∗ indicates p < 0.01.).
