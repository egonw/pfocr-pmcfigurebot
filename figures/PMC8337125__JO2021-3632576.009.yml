caption: Cancer pathway activity and drug sensitivity analysis of hub genes in KIRC.
  (a) The activation and inhibition of hub genes (PIK3CA, STRN, C9orf102, REST, and
  NHLRC2) in cancer-related signaling pathways in KIRC. (b) The correlation between
  the level of hub genes drug (PIK3CA, STRN, C9orf102, REST, and NHLRC2) and drug
  sensitivity in KIRC. These analyses were performed using the TCGA KIRC dataset (n = 538).
