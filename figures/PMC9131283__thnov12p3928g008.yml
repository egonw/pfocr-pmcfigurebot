caption: 'Model depicting a mechanism by which 5-HT regulates CAC tumorigenesis and
  development. Left: In premalignant cells, 5HT/5-HT2B enhances SMAD2/3 phosphorylation
  and SMAD4 expression via TGF-β, which inhibits the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway
  and suppresses the proliferation of tumor cells. Right: In tumor cells, 5HT/5-HT2B
  enhances Akt phosphorylation through TGF-β, which promotes the proliferation, migration,
  and invasion of tumor cells.'
