caption: Illustration of glucose, lactate, and pyruvate within the major energy pathways.
  Hexokinases uses ATP to phosphorylate glucose to glucose 6P (glucose 6-phosphate)
  in the first irreversible step of glycolysis. Glucose 6P can either undergo alternative
  metabolic fates or continue down the glycolytic pathway to generate pyruvate. Pyruvate
  can be utilised either by oxidative metabolism via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
  cycle or remain in the cytosol where it is converted to lactate. The glycolytic
  pathway that takes place in the cytoplasm produces a net yield of 2 ATP per molecule
  of glucose (2 ATP molecules are utilised early on but then paid back later with
  the generation of 4 ATP). Overall, the yield per mole of glucose metabolised fully
  to CO2 by combination of glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism is theoretically
  36â€“38 moles of ATP.
