figure_title: Elucidating the role of GPx4 in CRC cell lines
caption: A) Western blot of stable DLD1 doxycycline inducible shRNA cell lines (shNT,
  shGPx4–2, shGPx4–3), +/− doxycycline treatment (250 ng/mL) assessed at 72 hrs, β-Tubulin
  was used as a loading control. B) Colony formation assays of indicated stable shGPx4
  or shNT cell lines treated +/− doxycycline (250ng/mL) assessed at 2 weeks. C) 72
  hr live cell growth assay dose response of RSL3 in DLD1 shNT vs shGPx4–2 cell line,
  both pre-treated with doxycycline (250 ng/mL) for 72 hrs prior to addition of (S)-RSL3.
  D) 72 hr live cell growth JKE1674 dose response of CRC cell lines and HT1080. E)
  72 hr live cell growth assay JKE1674 dose response of the RKO CRC cell line, either
  untreated or pre-treated with 1 μM Lip-1. F) Schematic of the mechanism of the Thioredoxin
  Reductase-Peroxiredoxin system, where NADPH from the Pentose Phosphate Pathway is
  utilized in the selenoprotein Thioredoxin Reductase to recycle oxidized 2-Cys Peroxiredoxins
  after the redox mediated detoxification of hydrogen peroxide, forming a Peroxiredoxin
  dimer. G) Thioredoxin Reductase Kinetic Activity Assay measuring NADPH consumption
  through reduction of NADPH absorbance at 340 nm upon addition of NADPH and Selenocystine
  to cell lysates
article_title: Recharacterization of RSL3 reveals that the selenoproteome is a druggable
  target in colorectal cancer.
