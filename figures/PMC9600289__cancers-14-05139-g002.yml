caption: Demethylases participate in ESCA progression in an m6A-dependent way. (A)
  Ref. [] ALKBH5 downregulated expression of p21 by decreasing m6A modification level
  of CDKN1A and promoted proliferation and migration of ESCC cells; (B) Ref. [] ALKBH5
  inhibited biogenesis of miR-194-2 through decreasing its m6A modification level,
  upregulated expression of RAI1, activated Hippo signaling pathway and suppressed
  malignant biological behavior of ESCC cells; (C) Ref. [] FTO, as demethyltransferase
  of SIM2, interacted with CASC15 to decrease SIM2 expression and facilitate progression
  of ESCC.
