caption: Differential regulation of photosynthesis, photosynthesisâ€”antenna proteins,
  and chlorophyll-biosynthesis-related genes in XY15 (cold-sensitive) and GX74 (cold-tolerant)
  rapeseed siliques in response to cold treatment. The heatmaps represent the log2
  foldchange values. The lower two panels showing photosynthesis as well as antenna
  pathways were generated using KEGG pathway database []. The differentially expressed
  genes are highlighted as red text. CK and LW represent control and cold treatments.
  The gene name abbreviations refer to the full names presented in .

  Cold Responses in Rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) Genotypes with Contrasting Cold-Stress
  Sensitivity.
