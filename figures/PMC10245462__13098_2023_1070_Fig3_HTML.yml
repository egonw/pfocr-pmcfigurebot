caption: SNHG16 and miR-212-3p predicted binding sites (a). Schematic representation
  of SNHG16 mutant sites (b). qRT-PCR demonstrated that miR-212-3p was upregulated
  in the HG and LPS states but that inflammatory factors were downregulated after
  transfection of the miR-212-3p mimic (c). Dual-luciferase gene reporter assay (d)
article_title: Silencing LncRNA SNHG16 suppresses the diabetic inflammatory response
  by targeting the miR-212-3p/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway.
