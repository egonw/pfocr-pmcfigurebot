caption: UCA1 was proved to be able to regulate miR-145 levels. A. Target binding
  sites between UCA1 and miR-145. B. UCA1 has the ability to bind miR-145, which was
  assessed via DLR assay (independent-sample t test). miR-NC vs. miR-145-mimic, *P<0.05
  (n=3). C. Targeted binding between UCA1 and miR-145 was assessed by RIP (one-way
  ANOVA followed with LSD-t test) (n=3). D. Regulatory effect of UCA1 on miR-145 in
  OS cells after co-transfection was assessed by qRT-PCR (one-way ANOVA followed with
  LSD-t test). *P<0.05 vs. si-NC (n=3).
