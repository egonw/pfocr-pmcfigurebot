caption: SW480/oxaliplatin exosomes promotes angiogenesis in vivo. BALB/c nude mice
  were injected with SW480 cells and SW480-exos or SW480/oxaliplatin-exos for 28 days
  (n = 6). (a and b) The size and volume of the subcutaneous tumors in mice. (c) BMP-2
  expression detected by immunohistochemical staining. (d) The protein expression
  of VEGF and CD31 in tumors. All above experiments were repeatedly performed 3 times;
  data are shown as the means ± SD. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01.
