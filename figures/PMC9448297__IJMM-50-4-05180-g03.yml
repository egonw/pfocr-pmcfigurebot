caption: COMM-SUS cells resist oxidative stress by NADPH accumulation via PPP. (A)
  Schematic diagram of the main enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway, fatty acid
  synthesis pathway and folate metabolism pathway. The expression levels of the enzymes
  were interfered with by corresponding siRNA. (B) The expression of the main enzymes
  was measured in COMM-1 AD and COMM-1 SUS cells using reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR. (C) The amount of intracellular NADH and NADPH was evaluated after suppressing
  enzyme expression. Significance was determined using a Student's t-test or one-way
  ANONA (*P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 and ****P<0.0001; ns, not significant, P>0.05).
  COMM, Chinese oral mucosal melanoma; COMM-AD, cells with adhesive morphology; COMM-SUS,
  cells grown in suspension; PGD, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase.
