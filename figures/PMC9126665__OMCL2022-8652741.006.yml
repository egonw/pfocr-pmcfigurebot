caption: 'NBP failed to promote nuclear-Nrf2 accumulation and mitigate oxidative stress
  injury in Nrf2 knockout (Nrf2−/−) mice. (a) The results of genotype identification
  by PCR. (b)–(d) NBP treatment failed to alleviate the activity of SOD, the content
  of MDA, and the level of 8-iso PGF2α in Nrf2−/− mice after RCIR injury. n = 8 or
  10 per group. (e)–(h) Nuclear-Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 expressions were detected by
  Western blot in WT and Nrf2−/− mice 4 weeks after RCIR. NBP treatment failed to
  upregulate the nuclear-Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 expressions in Nrf2−/− mice compared
  to the WT group. n = 6 per group. β-Actin was used as an internal control. (i) The
  effect of NBP on Nrf2 nuclear accumulation was determined by immunofluorescent (400×,
  bar = 20 μm) in WT and Nrf2−/− mice 4 weeks after RCIR. n = 3 in each group. #P
  < 0.05, ###P < 0.001, the WT + NBP120 vs. the WT+ RCIR group; &P < 0.05, &&&P <
  0.001, the Nrf2−/− + RCIR group vs. the WT + RCIR group; ns: not significant, as
  indicated. Values are expressed as mean ± SD.'
