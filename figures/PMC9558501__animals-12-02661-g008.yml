caption: Binding of the ligand PD-L1 expressed on a CD4+ Th1 cell to its receptor
  PD-1 present on an M1 macrophage can induce M2 trans-differentiation of the PD-1-bearing
  target cell (forward signaling). Subsequently, the PD-1-bearing M2 macrophage may
  evoke trans-differentiation of the CD4+ Th1 cell into a Th17 cell by a process named
  reverse signaling. Within the tumor microenvironment, such a trans-differentiation
  of immune cells may contribute to the shifting of an anti-cancer type I immune response
  to a type II immune response that is associated with an equilibrium between cancer
  and immune cells or cancer immune escape.
