caption: Putative regulatory network of TaMATEs under the treatment of Al3+ in the
  wheat. ART1, Al resistance transcription factor; CEM, citrate exuding motif; TaMATEs
  represent the upregulation of TaMATE genes; represents the possible pathway for
  Al-citrate transfer by TaMATEs; represents Al-citrate transferred from root to leaf;
  represents the citrate; represents Al-citrate.
