caption: 'Annotation information of DEGs. (A) GO enrichment histogram of DEGs. The
  abscissa indicates the ratio of genes annotated to the entry to the total number
  of genes and the ordinate indicates the name of the GO entry. All DEGs were divided
  into three GO entries: biological process, cellular component, and molecular function.
  (B) KEGG classification column chart. DEGs were divided into five branches according
  to the KEGG metabolic pathway: Cellular Processes, Environmental Information Processing,
  Genetic Information Processing, Metabolism, and Organismal Systems.'
