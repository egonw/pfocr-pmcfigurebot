caption: H19 promotes dermal papilla cells proliferation. (A) RT-qPCR of H19 expression
  after transfection with adenoviruses pAd-H19, pAd-NC, and blank control. (B) Cell
  viability was determined by CCK-8 assay. (C) Cell viability was determined by MTT
  assay. (D) Cell viability was determined by EdU assay, red represents EdU staining
  and blue represents cell nuclei stained with Hoechst 33342; the scale bar stands
  for 100 μm. (E) Relative mRNA level of Wnt signaling pathway and downstream factors
  as detected by RT-qPCR. (F) β-catenin protein was detected by Western blot. The
  data were presented as mean ± SEM for 3 biological replicates, * p < 0.05, ** p
  < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
