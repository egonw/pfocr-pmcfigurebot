caption: SLs and wound affected the flavonesâ€™ pathway. (A) DAMs were mapped to the
  flavone pathway. The small heatmap in each section of the diagram shows the DAMs
  mapped to the pathway, and a small square indicates a metabolite. (B) Heatmaps of
  flavones contents. (C) Expression levels of three genes related to flavones in SLs
  mutants and wild-type plants. Heatmaps were drawn using the log2 (FC) value obtained
  from the pairwise comparison of samples. Red and blue indicated upregulation and
  downregulation, respectively.
