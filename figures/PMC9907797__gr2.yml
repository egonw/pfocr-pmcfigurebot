caption: Mproshows no interaction with IFN signaling pathway transducers.A, HEK-293T
  cells were transfected with a C-terminal flag-tagged EGFP-N15/N16-BFP plasmid along
  with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro or empty vector. Cells were lysed at 24 h after transfection
  and analyzed by Western blotting. B, HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with a C-terminal
  flag-tagged STAT1, STAT2, IRF9, JAK1, or TYK2 expression plasmid combined either
  with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro or empty vector. Whole-cell extracts were lysed 30 h posttransfection
  and analyzed by Western blotting. C, HeLa cells were transfected with pCDNA3.1-Mpro-mCherry
  visual construct, and 24 h posttransfection, cells were treated with or without
  IFNα (1000 U/ml) for 1 h and possessed for indirect immunofluorescence to detect
  the STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9. Scale bar, 10 μm. D, HEK-293T cells were transfected
  with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro or empty vector. After 24 h of expressing, cells were cultured
  with or without IFNα (1000 U/ml) for 1 h. Whole-cell extracts or the nuclear and
  cytoplasmic fractions were analyzed by Western blotting with specific antibodies
  for the detection of tyrosine phospho-STAT1 and STAT2 or total STAT1 and STAT2.
  E, density analysis represents the relative protein levels of phospho-STAT1 or phospho-STAT2
  that was normalized to the protein levels of α-tubulin or PCNA. The value of control
  group was set to 1. The presented results represent the means and standard deviations
  of data from three independent experiments. Statistical significance was calculated
  using unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t test. Protein band intensities were quantitated
  by Image Lab software. IFN, interferon; IRF9, interferon regulatory factor 9; Mpro,
  main protease; SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; STAT,
  signal transducer and activator of transcription.
