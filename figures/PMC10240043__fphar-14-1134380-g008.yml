caption: 'PUE affects the expression of proteins related to PI3K/AKT/Nrf2. (A) The
  expression of NRF2 (green labeled) and nuclear (blue labeled) in HT22 cells was
  measured by confocal laser scanning microscope. Bar = 25 μm. (B) Co-immunoprecipitation
  evaluation of Nrf2-Keap1 interaction in HT22 cells. (C) Representative protein imprinting
  image of PI3K, Akt, P-PI3K, P-Akt, Keap1, Nucleus Nrf2, Cytoplasm Nrf2 and HO-1
  in hippocampal neurons of the ischemic side of rat brain tissue. (D) Quantitative
  analysis of p-PI3K/PI3K protein expression. (E) Quantitative analysis of p-Akt/Akt
  protein expression. (F) Quantitative analysis of Keap1 protein expression. (G) Quantitative
  analysis of Nucleus Nrf2 protein expression. (H) Quantitative analysis of Cytoplasm
  Nrf2 protein expression. (I) Quantitative analysis of HO-1 protein expression. All
  data are expressed as mean ± SD. ##p < 0.01 vs. control group, *p < 0.05 or **p
  < 0.01 vs. OGD/R group, △p < 0.05 or △△p < 0.01 vs. PUE group.'
