caption: 'Enrichment analysis of COVID-19, regarding the KEGG pathways (A) and signaling
  pathways in the Reactome database (B). Pathways that are overrepresented in the
  gene set of interest are shown. Furthermore, only genes present in a given pathway
  are given. Overrepresentation of the gene set of interest (input genes), regarding
  the pathways was tested using the hypergeometric test against the pre−defined gene
  sets (background genes) obtained from Reactome or KEGG. Input genes that are overlapping
  in the pathway, the enrichment p-value and the proportion of the overlapping genes
  (input genes relative to the tested gene set) are shown. Source: FUMA.'
