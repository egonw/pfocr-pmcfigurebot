caption: The anti-metastasis-related effects of SC-1 in TGFβ-treated cells. A549 cells
  were pretreated with SC-1 or equal volume of DMSO for 4 h, wound-healing migration
  assay (A) and transwell invasion assay was performed to analyze the migratory ability
  of lung cancer cells ((B), DAPI staining, n = 9). Scale bar represents 200 μm. In
  migration assay, A549 cells were treated with DMSO (Ae) SC-1 (Af), TGFβ (Ag), or
  SC-1 plus TGFβ (Ah) for 24 h. Wound edges were indicated with red solid lines; results
  were normalized with 0 h ((Aa), (Ab), (Ac), (Ad), respectively) and expressed as
  percentage of control. In transwell assay, A549 cells were treated with DMSO (Ba),
  TGFβ (Bb) SC-1 plus TGFβ (Bc), or SC-1 (Bd) for 24 h. (B) Cells were stained with
  DAPI and photographed (n = 9). Results were represented as number of infiltrated
  cells based on DAPI signal. Scale bar represents 200 μm. Data are shown as mean
  ± SD, two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test, ** p < 0.001.
