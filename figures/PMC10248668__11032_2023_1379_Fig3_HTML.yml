caption: Levels of expression of genes in the GA pathway. A The level of expression
  of the primary genes in GA synthesis and signaling pathway in DW-B compared with
  its parents based on transcriptome sequencing. The area of dark and gray rectangles
  indicates the numbers of upregulated and downregulated transcripts of GID1 and DELLA,
  respectively. B, C Levels of expression of GID and DELLA in DW-B and its parents
  by qRT-PCR. The columns represent the mean values ± SD for three replicates. Statistically
  significant differences among the samples are indicated by different lowercase letters
  (P < 0.05). The data were analyzed using SPSS 22.0 (IBM, Inc., Armonk, NY, USA),
  and the significance of the difference between each sample was determined by a one-way
  analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Duncan’s multiple range tests at the 0.05 and 0.01
  significance levels. GA, gibberellin; qRT-PCR, real-time quantitative reverse transcription
  PCR; SD, standard deviation
