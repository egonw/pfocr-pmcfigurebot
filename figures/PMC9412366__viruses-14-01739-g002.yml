caption: The distinct innate immune response of host cells under the ADE of viral
  infections. The virus–antibody complex binds to and activates FcRs that upregulate
  dihydroacetone kinase (DAK) and autophagy-related gene 5 and 12 (Atg5-Atg12 complex);
  it subsequently inhibits the TLRs activation and signaling pathway. Meanwhile, IL-10
  activates the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) and then inhibits the Janus
  kinase-signal transducer and the activator of transcription (JAK-STAT)-specific
  pathway, resulting in the suppression of the interferon-mediated antiviral responses
  of host cells. On the other hand, release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm
  leads to the activation of TLRs, which subsequently increases IL-1β release by activating
  the NF-κB signaling pathway.
