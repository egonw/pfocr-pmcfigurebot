caption: UpSet plot for differential genesâ€™ intersection among 11 cancers and functional
  enrichment analysis. (A) In the UpSet plot, the intersection of different cancers
  is represented by solid dots and lines, and the number of intersections is represented
  by the histogram above. Different numbers of significantly differential genes for
  each cancer (marked blue) were identified. Finally, 67 early-stage pan-cancer biomarkers
  were identified by taking the intersection of 11 cancers (marked red). (B) Gene
  Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. The top five significantly enriched GO biological
  processes and relevant genes. (C) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
  pathway enrichment analysis. The top five significantly enriched KEGG pathways and
  relevant genes.
