caption: 'Alpelisib plus trastuzumab causes prominent inhibition in the growth of
  HCC1954 xenografts and significantly increases apoptosis. A. Each plot indicates
  the mean value of the tumor volume. Final tumor volume was summarized and statistically
  analyzed. B. Each plot represents the mean value of body weight. Box charts show
  the distribution of final body weight. C. Images of the xenografts were taken immediately
  after harvesting. D. DAPI, HER2, and TUNEL signals were captured in each xenograft.
  Blue, red, and green fluorescence indicates DAPI, HER2, and TUNEL signals, respectively.
  E. Bar charts represent the mean value of positive TUNEL signals in the xenografts.
  Error bars represent the standard error in tumor volume and body weight, and SD
  in TUNEL signals. P-value: *P<0.05, **P<0.01, and ****P<0.0001. A plus T: alpelisib
  plus trastuzumab; n.s.: not significant.'
