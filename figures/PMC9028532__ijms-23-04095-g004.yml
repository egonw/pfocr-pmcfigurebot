caption: 'Schematic representation of 3CLpro effects in viral replication and STAT1
  degradation. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus. Upon fusion
  of the viral and host cell membranes, viral genomic RNA is released in the cytoplasm.
  (A) the viral RNA initiates the translation of co-terminal polypeptides 1a and 1ab.
  These polyproteins are subsequently cleaved by 3CLpro protease into non-structural
  proteins such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase and ribonucleases; (B) the
  coronavirus replicase-transcriptase complex is an assembly of viral and cellular
  proteins that mediates the synthesis of genome- and subgenome-sized mRNAs in the
  virus-infected cell; (C) in the course of the SARS-CoV-2 infective cycle, the replicase-transcriptase
  complex amplifies the genomic RNA and synthesizes mRNAs that encode the structural
  proteins of the virus and proteins that are non-essential for replication in cell
  culture but appear to confer a selective advantage in vivo (accessory proteins);
  (D) production of new virions. The autophagic process is divided into four distinct
  stages: (1) Initiation, (2) autophagosomal formation (elongation), (3) autophagosome-lysosome
  fusion, and (4) autophagolysosome formation and cargo degradation. LC3B is a central
  protein in the autophagy pathway, where it functions in autophagy substrate selection
  and autophagosome biogenesis. 3CLpro could promote the colocalization between STAT1
  and LC3B causing the autophagic degradation of STAT1, as shown by the rescue of
  STAT1 by autophagy/autolysosome inhibitor 3-methyladenine and bafilomycin A1.'
