caption: ENPP1 expression across various cancer types. Publicly available sequencing
  datasets were analyzed to determine the gene and protein expression of ENPP1 across
  cancer types. (A) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA sequencing data from tumor
  tissue samples were analyzed using the UALCAN analysis tool. The gene expression
  of ENPP1 across cancer types has been shown, where breast cancer shows the highest
  expression (4.27 log2(TPM+1)). (B) Protein abundance of ENPP1 across cancer cell
  lines. The data were acquired from the CCLE database and analyzed through cBioPortal.
  MDA-MB-231 (triple-negative breast cancer cell line) shows an abundance ratio of
  3.55 (ratio with adjacent normal). A549 (lung adenocarcinoma) had an abundance ratio
  of 0.58. (C) Pearson’s correlation analysis showed the correlation between mRNA
  and protein expressions of ENPP1. The mRNA expression levels are positively correlated
  with the protein expression across all cancer cell lines (r = 0.55; p = 1.16 × 10−29).
  MDA-MB-231 and A549 cell lines are highlighted in red and yellow, respectively.
  (D) The PAM50-classified breast cancer samples [] have been analyzed to depict the
  levels of ENPP1 protein abundance across the molecular subtypes.
