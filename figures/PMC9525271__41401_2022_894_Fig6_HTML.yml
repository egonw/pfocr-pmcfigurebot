figure_title: ADH1C suppresses CRC via inhibiting expression of phosphatidylserine
  synthase PHGHD and PSAT1
caption: 'a Overexpression of ADH1C significantly reduced expression of PHGDH and
  PSAT1 mRNA and protein expression in CRC cell lines. b Protein level verification
  of the knockdown effects on PHGDH and PSAT1 of several siRNA. c–f Overexpression
  of ADH1C, knockdown of PHGDH or PSAT1 expression resulted in the same phenotype
  in CRC cells. Overexpression of ADH1C, knockdown of PHGDH or PSAT1 expression reduced
  cell proliferation rates. c Inhibited invasion and d migration, e and f reduced
  colony formation. There is no significant difference between results caused by overexpression
  of ADH1C, knockdown of PHGDH or PSAT1 expression. g Overexpression of ADH1C, knockdown
  of PHGDH or PSAT1 expression can significantly reduce the intracellular serine level.
  There is no significant difference between results caused by overexpression of ADH1C,
  knockdown of PHGDH or PSAT1 expression. The serine concentration was measured by
  the ELISA kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. h Exogenous addition
  of serine can reverse the effect of ADH1C overexpression, knockdown of PHGDH or
  PSAT1 on CRC cells. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01 compared with control; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01
  compared with ADH1C-OE; ΔΔP < 0.01 compared with siRNA PHGDH; ξP < 0.05; ξξP < 0.01
  compared with siRNA PSAT1.'
