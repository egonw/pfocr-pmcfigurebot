caption: Biosynthetic pathway of proposed FRs in Chrysanthemum and specialized flavonone
  rutinosides in Citrus. Genes encoding OMT, 7GlcT, and F3ʹH were presumably involved
  in pharmaceutically active linarin, isorhoifolin, and diosmin biosynthesis. Dashed
  arrows indicate proposed steps. Enzymes highlighted in red represents 1,6RhaT that
  has been biochemically characterized in this study. FNS II, flavonoid synthase II;
  F3ʹH, flavonoid-3ʹ-hydroxylase; 1,6RhaT, flavonoid-7-O-glucoside-1,6-RhaT; Cm1,6RhaT,
  flavanone-7-O-glucoside-1,6-RhaT from pummelo (Citrus maxima); Cs1,6RhaT, flavanone-7-O-glucoside-1,6-RhaT
  from oranges (Citrus sinensis).
