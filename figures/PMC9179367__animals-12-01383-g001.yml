caption: Two NAD+biosynthetic pathways in the cell. NA enters the cell via facilitated
  diffusion through solute carrier proteins where it is converted to NaMN via NaPRT.
  NMNAT then converts NaMN to NaAD before it is converted to NAD+ via NADS. Sirtuin
  proteins and PARPs consume NAD+, which releases NAM. NAMPT then converts NAM to
  NMN, which is then recycled back into NAD+ by NMNAT. NaR and NR enter the cell through
  nucleoside transporter proteins where they feed into the Preiss–Handler and salvage
  pathways, respectively. The two NAD+ pathways are highlighted in their respective
  boxes. The metabolites examined in this study are represented in green, and NAD+
  is the end product of each pathway, represented in red. NA—nicotinic acid, NaMN—nicotinic
  acid mononucleotide, NaAD—nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide, NAD—nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide, NAM—nicotinamide, NMN—nicotinamide mononucleotide, NR—nicotinamide
  riboside, NaR—nicotinic acid riboside, PARPs—poly-ADP-ribose polymerases, NRK1/2—nicotinamide
  riboside kinase1/2, NaPRT—nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase, NMNAT—nicotinamide
  mononucleotide adenylyltransferase, NADS—NAD synthase, NAMPT—nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase.
