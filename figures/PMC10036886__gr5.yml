caption: The results for the binding site enrichment analysis for highly correlated
  genes ofPTK7 that involves in cell cycle pathway. (A) Number of transcription factor
  binding sites on the promoters of query genes (enriched cell cycle-related genes).
  FOXM1 is one of the enriched transcription factors. (B) The correlations of FOXM1
  and query genes.
