caption: Location of missense SNPs with regards to predicted protein domains. (a)
  IFNAR1 – Y217, E219G and A404V can be found in fibronectin type 3 (FN3) domains.
  (b) IFNAR2 – P45S occurs in a tissue factor domain, N188D and I214T occur in an
  interferon binding domain and G264V occurs in the transmembrane region. (c) IFNGR1
  – no SNPs were identified in the predicted domains. (d) IFNGR2 – C44R in tissue
  factor domain. (e) IFNLR1 – E151G, S199P and S211P occur in an interferon binding
  domain. (f) IL10Rβ – no SNPs were identified in predicted domains. (g) IFNβ – S151P
  SNP occurs in an IFNα/β/δ domain. (h) STAT1 – V341G SNP occurs in a STAT binding
  domain. (i) JAK1 – Y500D occurs in an Src Homolog 2 (SH2) domain. (j) TYK2 – H215P
  and R299Q occur in a band 4.1 (B41) domain and S875N, S883P and D908A occur in tyrosine
  kinase catalytic domains (TyrKc). (k) IRF9 – Y335S occurs in an interferon regulatory
  factor 3 (IRF3) domain. Note, chickens lack IRF3 but have an IRF7 orthologue. IFαβδ,
  Interferon alpha, beta and delta domain; STAT_int, STAT protein interaction domain;
  STAT_alpha, STAT protein all‐alpha domain; STAT_bind, STAT protein DNA binding domain;
  B41, band 4.1 homologue domain (also known as ERM domain, erzin/radixin/moesin domain);
  STYKc, protein kinase of unclassified specificity; IRF, interferon regulatory factor
  domain. Pink indicates low complexity regions and dark blue blocks signify transmembrane
  regions
