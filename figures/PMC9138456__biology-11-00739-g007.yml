caption: Photomicrograph of TGF-β1 expression in the different experimental groups.
  (A) NC group. (B,C) CCl4 group showing strong immunostaining reaction in periductal
  cells in the portal tract, perisinusoidal cells, around the blood vessels, sinusoidal
  lining cells, non-parenchymal mesenchymal cells, Kupffer cells, inflammatory cells,
  and hepatocytes along collagenous fibrous. (D,E) CCl4+ D-carvone group showing marked
  decline of positive immunostaining cells. (F) D-carvone group.
