caption: Metformin inhibited cell migration and invasion in endometrial carcinoma
  cells. Cell migration ability was detected using a wound healing assay and transwell
  migration assay. The invasion ability was determined using in vitro transwell invasion
  assays. (a and b) The decrease in relative areas between the scratches in the higher
  concentration metformin treatment group was less evident, which indicated an inhibitory
  effect of metformin on Ishikawa cell migration. (c and d) Metformin greatly inhibited
  cell migration in Ishikawa cells. (e and f) The inhibition of cell migration in
  metformin-treated RL95-2 cells was more significant. (g and h) Cell invasion after
  exposure to different concentrations of metformin in Ishikawa cells. (i and j) Cell
  invasion was inhibited by metformin in RL95-2 cells. Each experiment was performed
  in triplicate and repeated at least three times independently. Data are presented
  as the mean ± SD. ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01 versus controls. Met, metformin; Con, control.
