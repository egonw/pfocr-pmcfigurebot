caption: 6mdA exposure led to activation of the signaling pathway downstream of c-Kit(A)
  Schematic diagram of the signaling pathways downstream of c-Kit.(B) Western blot
  analysis of the expression and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and (D) AKT in EPCs on
  the indicated days.(C) Quantitative analysis of the expression and phosphorylation
  of ERK1/2 and (E) AKT protein levels from three independent experiments of EPCs.
  Data are presented as mean ± SD. The p values were calculated by one-way ANOVA (N.S.,
  no significance, ∗p<0.05, ∗∗p<0.01, ∗∗∗p<0.001).
