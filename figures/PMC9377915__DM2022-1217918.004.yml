caption: TCGA analysis reveals that TAB2 regulates EMT and PI3K-AKT pathway in OSCC.
  (a) Differentially expressed genes are shown by volcano scatter plots. Blue dots
  represent downregulated genes in TAB2 high expression group, gray represents no
  significant change genes, and red represents upregulated genes. (b) The Gene Ontology
  biological process enrichment analysis of DEGs identified the most relevant function
  modulated by TAB2. (c) The KEGG enrichment analysis was performed to obtain downstream
  signaling pathway by monitoring upregulated DEGs. (d and e) Western blot analysis
  of caspase-3, 8, and 9 genes in SCC9 and SCC1 cell lines. (f and g) Western blot
  analysis of EMT and PI3K-AKT pathway key genes using indicated antibodies in SCC9
  and SCC1 cell lines.
