caption: 'Measurement of P2X7 mRNA and protein levels in the DRG and co-expression
  levels of P2X7R with GFAP. (A) P2X7 mRNA. (B) SDS-PAGE of P2X7R protein in DRG of
  experimental rats in each group. (C) P2X7R protein expression in the DRG of each
  group was analyzed. (D) Co-expression of GFAP and P2X7R in DRG. (E) Relative fluorescence
  intensity levels of GFAP in each group. (F) Relative fluorescence intensity levels
  of GFAP and P2X7R co-expression. P2X7 mRNA, protein levels, and co-expression levels
  of P2X7R and GFAP in the P2X7 shRNA group were lower than in the DNP rats. Blue
  staining (DAPI) marks the nucleus, green staining (GFAP) marks activated SGCs, and
  red staining marks P2X7R. The scale bar represents 50 µm; data are shown as mean
  ± SEM based on at least three independent experiments, n = 6; ** p < 0.01 versus
  the Control group; ## p < 0.01 versus the DNP group.'
