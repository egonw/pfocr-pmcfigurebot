figure_title: Feed forward NOTCH activation is initiated by tumor myeloid cells after
  oHSV treatment
caption: 'A: Changes in macrophage expressed NOTCH pathway genes measured by RNA-Seq
  of Raw264.7 macrophages co-cultured with rHSVQ infected or uninfected U87ΔEGFR cells
  (n=4/each). B: qRT-PCR of NOTCH ligands in F4/80+ cells isolated from GL261N4-bearing
  brain hemispheres 2 days after treatment with rHSVQ (2×105pfu/mouse) or PBS (n=3/each
  group). C: Immunofluorescence staining of Jag1 in vitro in GBM12 cells (±HSVQ, MOI
  = 0.3 MOI) overlaid with Raw264.7 macrophages pre-stained with CellTracker Blue
  CMAC Dye. rHSVQ infected cells are green, Jag1 is red, and F-actin is white. Scale
  bar is 20μm. D-F: D: Schematic of data shown in E-F. GBM12 cells were treated with
  rHSVQ or control and overlaid with macrophages. Macrophages were negatively isolated
  using human CD56 microbeads and overlaid on RBP-Jk NOTCH reporter transduced glioma
  cells (E) or NOTCH reporter transduced macrophages (F) for 9 hours with or without
  Jag1 neutralizing antibody. Changes in luciferase activity were measured relative
  to uninfected cells (n=4/each). G: Immunofluorescence staining of U87ΔEGFR tumor
  sections. Fluorescence microscopy revealed NICD+ cells (Red) in both oHSV infected
  areas (ICP4+, green) and uninfected areas. In areas evident of virus infection (ICP4+),
  NICD+ cells aer surrounded by infected ICP4+ cells (arrowhead). H: In uninfected
  areas (devoid of ICP4 (green)) staining areas of NICD positivity (red in left panel)
  showed Iba1 and Jag 1 positivity (red in middle and last panel, respectively) in
  serial sections. I: DN-MAML expression in infected tumor cells could not repress
  oHSV-mediated Jag1 expression (n=3–4/each). Control or DN-MAML-transfected GBM12
  cells were infected with rHSVQ and overlaid with Raw264.7 macrophages for 9 hours.
  Gene expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR. J: Dot plot from RNA-seq showing significantly
  changed signaling pathways in Raw264.7 macrophages co-cultured with U87ΔEGFR cells
  treated with or without rHSVQ infection (n=4/each). K: qRT-PCR of Jag1 in Raw264.7
  macrophages treated with the indicated drugs (Pam3CSK4: 100ng/ml, FSL-1: 100ng/ml)
  (n=4/each). L. qRT-PCR of Jag1 in Raw264.7 macrophages co-cultured with rHSVQ infected
  or uninfected GBM12 cells and with the indicated drugs (DMSO or CU CPT-22: 25μM)
  (n=3/each). M. Schema showing tumor cell activated NOTCH contributes to macrophage
  recruitment to sites of viral infection and macrophage-mediated NOTCH spreading.
  oHSV-infected tumor cells induce Jag1 expression on macrophages through activation
  of TLR2 signaling. These Jag1 expressing macrophages spread into oHSV-uninfected
  areas and increase NOTCH signaling in uninfected tumor cells away from the site
  of viral infection. The statistical significance was calculated by analysis of variance
  with the Tukey’s post hoc test (E, F, I, K, and L). Data shown are the mean ± SD.'
