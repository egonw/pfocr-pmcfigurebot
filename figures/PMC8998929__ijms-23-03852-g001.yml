caption: Hippo signaling pathway. YAP, a downstream target of the Hippo signaling
  pathway, activates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a major regulator of
  cell growth. This suggests that the Hippo pathway, PTEN, and AKT are related. The
  stimulation of AKT and inhibition of the Hippo signaling pathway affect ovarian
  follicle growth. AKT activates dormant primordial follicles and promotes follicle
  growth by interfering with the Hippo signaling pathway by ovarian fragments. YAP
  regulates carcinogenesis in endometrial adenocarcinoma, and YAP expression correlated
  with the type of endometrial adenocarcinoma. In addition, the Hippo signaling pathway
  is a key downstream signaling branch of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor
  (GPER) and plays a crucial role in breast tumorigenesis.
