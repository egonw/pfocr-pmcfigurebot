caption: HMGB1 promotes cell cycle progression via RAGE-dependent ERK1/2 signaling
  pathway in GSCs(A) qPCR analysis of RAGE, TLR2, and TLR4 mRNA levels in GSCs under
  hypoxia for 24 h. Data are normalized to normoxia group and represented as mean ±
  SD Significance was determined by two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test. n = 3 replicates
  for each group. ∗∗∗, p < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗, p < 0.0001.(B and C) Western blot and quantitative
  analysis of TLR2 and TLR4 expression in GSCs with HMGB1 knockdown under hypoxia
  for 24 h. (B) Representative blots are shown. (C) Data are normalized to shNT group
  and represented as mean ± SD Significance was determined by two-tailed unpaired
  Student’s t test. n = 3 replicates for each group. ns, no significance.(D) The correlation
  of HMGB1 mRNA expression with AGER (RAGE mRNA) in patients with GBM (IDH wt) from
  CGGA database using Pearson’s correlation analysis. n = 288, r = 0.4494; ∗∗∗∗, p < 0.0001.(E
  and F) Immunofluorescent double staining of HMGB1 (red) and RAGE (green) in human
  GBM specimens. DAPI stained nuclei (blue). (E) Representative images are shown.
  Scale bar, 25μm. (F) Quantitative analysis of cells co-expressing HMGB1 and RAGE
  in total cells. Data are represented as mean ± SD 9 random microscope fields of
  each GBM specimen (n = 3) were selected.(G and H) GSEA and heatmap show upregulation
  of cell cycle progression genes in patients with GBM with higher expression of HMGB1
  based on the CGGA dataset. NES, normalized enrichment score. FDR, false discovery
  rate.(I and J) Western blot and quantitative analysis of the expression of RAGE-dependent
  ERK1/2 signaling molecules in GSCs with HMGB1 knockdown under hypoxia for 24 h.
  (I) Representative blots are shown. (J) Data are normalized to shNT group and represented
  as mean ± SD Significance was determined by two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test.
  n = 3 replicates for each group. ∗, p < 0.05; ∗∗, p < 0.01; ∗∗∗, p < 0.001.
