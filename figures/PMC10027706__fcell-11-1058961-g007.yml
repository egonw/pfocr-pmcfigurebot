caption: Cell fate decisions in the Drosophila and mammalian retina. (A) Summary of
  conserved transcription factors that are necessary to specify Rh5 photoreceptor
  fate in Drosophila and rod photoreceptor fate in mammals. (B) Model for Blimp-1’s
  function as a permissive factor that represses wts at the transcriptional level
  in parallel with the ecdysone-responsive Hr3. Blimp-1 is expressed in pupal PRs
  in an EcR-dependent manner, but when Yki is not activated, Blimp-1 is not sufficient
  to repress wts and thereby gives rise to Rh6 fate. However, when Yki is transiently
  activated, possibly in response to the TGFβ signal from the distal R7 photoreceptor,
  Yki/Sd activate an unknown Rh5 subtype-specific transcription factor “X” that acts
  in combination with Blimp-1 and Hr3 to repress the wts enhancer, thereby silencing
  wts transcription and giving rise to robust Yki activation as well as Rh5 fate.
