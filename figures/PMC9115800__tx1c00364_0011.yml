caption: Nuclear and whole-cell area of HCEC-1CT cells incubated for 24 h with 10
  μM AOH, 1 μM ATX-II, and the binary mixture (=combi) without stimulus (A + C) and
  24 h with 22 h of concomitant IL-1β incubation (B + D). Mean areas of at least four
  biological replicates and technical triplicates were measured in nm2 and normalized
  to the solvent control or stimulus control, respectively. Panels (E + F) show immunofluorescence
  staining of Ocln protein expression. Mean CTCF values of at least four biological
  replicates and technical triplicates were normalized to the respective control conditions.
  Significant differences to the control conditions were calculated by applying the
  Student’s t-test at p < 0.05 * and p < 0.001 ***.
