caption: Type II interferon pathway engagement in microglia/macrophages in poorly
  myelinating regions of developing white matter. A Diagram of approach comparing
  iROI-M+ and iROI-M− from respective samples. B Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)
  of genes differentially expressed between iROI-M+ and iROI-M− indicated predicted
  upstream regulators IFNG, LPS, and TNF, which are part of the Type II interferon
  response. C Volcano plots of iROI-M+ and iROI-M− in injured infants, with non-interferon-related
  differentially expressed genes in grey, and interferon-related differentially expressed
  genes in pink. D IRF8 + cells per mm2 in cROI (n = 7 infants), iROI-M+ (n = 5 infants)
  and iROI-M− (n = 8 infants). Unpaired 2-tailed Student’s t-test, **P = 0.0046 for
  iROI-M− versus cROI, θθ P = 0.0037 for iROI-M− versus iROI-M+. E Representative
  images of IRF8 (green) and CD68 (red) double positive cells in injured regions (arrowheads),
  counterstained for Hoechst (blue). Scale bar, 20 µm. F Mean IRF8 + CD68 + cells/mm2
  in cROI (n = 7 in fants), iROI-M+ (n = 5 infants) and iROI-M− (n = 8 infants). Unpaired
  2-tailed Student’s t-test, **P = 0.0046 for iROI-M− versus cROI. G Mean IRF8 + CD68 + cells
  per mm2 in iROI-M+ versus iROI-M−. Paired 2-tailed Student’s t-test, *P = 0.0409,
  n = 4 infants. H Percentage of CD68 + cells which are IRF8 + in iROI-M+ versus iROI-M−.
  Paired 2-tailed Student’s t-test, *P = 0.0363, n = 4 infants. I Representative images
  of myelin (MBP; green) and microglia/macrophages (CD68; red) in infant with good
  myelination in iROI-M− (infant 4) versus infant with poor myelination, counterstained
  for Hoechst (blue) in iROI-M− (infant 3). Scale bar, 100 µm
