caption: ABBV-744 induces autophagy and autophagic flux in gastric cancer cells. (A-B)
  RNA sequencing results showed differential gene expression. GO is enriched in autophagy.
  (C) KEGG enrichment in the signaling pathway. (D) The Levels of LC3B and P62 changes
  in AGS and HGC-27after 24 h of ABBV-744 treatment were detected by Western blotting.
  (E) Morphology of autophagic vesicles observed by transmission electron microscopy.
  (F) AGS and HGC-27 were pretreated 1h with 3-MA (3mM) and CQ (50Î¼M), then detected
  autophagy-associated proteins level by western blots with or without ABBV-744.
