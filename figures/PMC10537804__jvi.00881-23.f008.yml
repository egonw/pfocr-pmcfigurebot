caption: Model for miR-BART11-3p-mediated enhancement of proliferation and migration
  by targeting a DUSP6/MAPK pathway in EBVaGC. EBV-encoded miR-BART11-3p downregulates
  the expression of DUSP6 by directly targeting the 3â€²-UTR of DUSP6, which consequently
  leads to increased phosphorylation of ERK coupled with decreased phosphorylation
  of JNK and p38. The increased phospho-ERK signaling pathway ultimately enhances
  EBVaGC progression by facilitating proliferation, migration, and invasion of tumor
  cells.

  to promote gastric cancer cell proliferation and metastasis.
