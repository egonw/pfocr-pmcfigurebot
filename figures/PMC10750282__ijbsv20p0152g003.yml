caption: The signalling network between cGAS-STING signalling and other signalling
  pathways. A) Crosstalk with TLR4-NF-κB signalling. Recognition of bacterial LPS
  by TLR4 receptors activates downstream signalling pathways. Activated TLR4 binds
  MyD88 and activates downstream TRAF6, leading to TBK1/IKK-mediated activation of
  NF-κB. TLR4 also activates the TRIF-dependent pathway by binding TRIF, which activates
  TBK1 and IKKε, ultimately leading to IRF3 activation and IFN-β production. B) Crosstalk
  with JNK signalling. The type I interferon IFN-α/β produced by the cells can in
  turn target the IFNAR receptor, which activates STAT1 and STAT2 and forms the transcription
  factor complex IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3). ISGF3 can activate the JNK/TBK1/IRF3
  signalling cascade. C) Crosstalk with autophagy signalling. Activated STING can
  be degraded in lysosomes in response to the autophagy protein ATG9. STING can also
  be degraded by phosphorylation of p62/SQSTM1. All of these modalities can inhibit
  the inflammatory response resulting from the sustained activation of STING. D) Crosstalk
  with AMPK signalling. The cGAMP generated by cGAS inhibits the activation of LKB1/AMPKα,
  resulting in the dissociation of ULK1 from AMPK. Subsequently, ULK1 phosphorylates
  the S366 site of STING, which inhibits IRF3 and reduces the production of IFN-β.
  E) Crosstalk with mTOR signalling. The downstream effector of mTOR, S6K1, can form
  the S6K1-STING-TBK1 complex and promote the activation of IRF3. F) Crosstalk with
  insulin signalling. Activated IRF3 inhibits the expression of AKT and the downstream
  signalling molecule GLUT4, which causes glucose accumulation in adipose tissue.
  In contrast, it can also stimulate glucose uptake and utilization in adipose tissue
  through the AKT/IRS1 pathway. G) Crosstalk with cell death signalling pathways.
  MT stress induces the release of ROS, which trigger the NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD-mediated
  release of mtDNA into macrophages, thereby activating the cGAS-STING pathway. This
  can produce proinflammatory cytokines, leading to hepatocyte pyroptosis. Bacterial
  DNA activates AIM2/Caspase-1-mediated apoptosis, resulting in elevated expression
  of ASC proteins. After activation, ASC interacts with STING to block the activation
  of TBK1 and IRF3, thereby inhibiting the production of IFN-β.
