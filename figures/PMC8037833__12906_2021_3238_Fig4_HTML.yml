caption: Enrichment analysis. Top 20 ontology items are displayed in the enrichment
  images. Count represents number of gene involved in every item and the bigger the
  -log 10 (p value), the more important the item. Itâ€™s clearly displayed at the diagram
  that KEGG pathway includes HIF-1 signaling pathway, insulin resistance, TNF signaling
  pathway, and AMPK signaling pathway. What attracted our eyes are items figured out
  through GO-BP analysis including regulation of reactive oxygen species metabolic
  process, apoptotic signaling pathway, response to oxygen levels, regulation of cellular
  response to stress, response to toxic substance, aging, and cellular response to
  organonitrogen compound, and items analyzed through GO-MF, such as nitric-oxide
  synthase regulator activity, insulin receptor binding, glucose transmembrane transporter
  activity, insulin receptor substrate binding, phosphotransferase activity, alcohol
  group as acceptor, and kinase binding
