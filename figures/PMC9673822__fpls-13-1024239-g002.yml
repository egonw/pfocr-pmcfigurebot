caption: Metabolomes and differential expression of metabolomes (DEMs) of different
  tissues in P. chinensis by UPLC-MS analysis. (A), PCA analysis of all samples. Scattered
  dots in different colors represent samples from different experimental groups; (B),
  Venn diagram of annotations in KEGG, HMDB and Lipdmaps database; (C), DEMs clustering
  heatmap of roots, rhizomes, pseudobulbs and leaves, and divided into five clusters
  in different color on the left heatmap and marked 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 on the right heatmap.
  Expression value was calculated based on Log2 Fold change. (D), DEMs of B3 vs B1
  on negative ion mode in KEGG pathway enrichment; (E), DEMs of B3 vs B1 on positive
  ion mode in KEGG pathway enrichment; (F), Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis by Metaboanalyst
  on line analyses. Red boxes were detected and annotated KEGG components; (G), Gastrodin
  and 4-Hydroxybenzyl alcohol contents of different tissues by HPLC in dry and fresh
  P. chinensis. PCA, Principal component analysis; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
  and Genomes; Roots (B1), rhizomes (B2), pseudobulbs (B3) and leaves (B4).
