caption: Overexpression of METTL3 promoted proliferation, migration and invasion of
  ESCC cell lines. (A) Left and right panel showed the expression level of METTL3
  in TE1 and KYSE30 cells transfected with oeMETTL3 or oeVec plasmid by qRT-PCR and
  western blot. (B) Cell proliferation ability and colony formation ability of TE1
  and KYSE30 cells transfected with oeMETTL3 or oeVec plasmid were evaluated by MTS
  assay and colony formation assay. (C-D) Cell migration and invasion abilities of
  TE1 and KYSE30 cells transfected with oeMETTL3 or oeVec plasmid were evaluated by
  wound healing experiment, transwell migration and matrigel invasion assay. All data
  are presented as the mean Â± SDs (n = 3). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
