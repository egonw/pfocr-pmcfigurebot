caption: 'Effects of Si-Miao-Yong-an (SMYA) on aortic root plaque stability and the
  ratio of PA/LA in mice. (a) HE staining was used to observe as in ApoE−/− mice treated
  with SMYA. In the model group, the aortic intima was significantly thickened, as
  plaques were formed, a large number of foam cells, cholesterol crystals and lipids
  accumulated in the plaques, and plaques ruptured and bled. After the intervention
  of SMYA, the plaque area was reduced, the foam cell infiltration in the plaque was
  alleviated, the cholesterol crystals and lipid accumulation were reduced, and the
  degree of intimal thickening was mild (optical microscope, ×100). (b) after the
  intervention of SMYA, the ratio of aortic plaque area (PA) was significantly decreased.
  (c) after the intervention of SMYA, the ratio of aortic plaque area (PA) to lumen
  area (LA) (PA/LA) was significantly decreased. Data are shown as mean ± SD. **p < 0.01,
  compared with the normal control (NC) group. ##p < 0.01, compared with the model
  group.'
