caption: 'Overexpressed BMP2 enhances lipid accumulation and thermogenesis, while
  knockdown BMP2 has the opposite effect. (A) Schematic representation of the experimental
  design. (B) Adipogenesis assessed by Oil Red O staining at day 8 of differentiation.
  (C) Overexpression and ablation efficiency of BMP2 in porcine SVFs, n = 6. (D) Western
  blot analysis of the expression of adipogenic and thermogenic marker genes. (E–H)
  OCR in differentiated porcine beige adipocytes with BMP2 overexpression or knockdown
  (E). The basal cellular respiration rate (F), maximal respiration (G), and proton
  leak (H) were calculated. The seahorse assay data were normalized to the total protein
  content, n = 10. All data are presented as the mean ± SEM, * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001.
  (I) Venn diagram based on the number of DEGs. (J) Heatmap and detailed list of genes
  with the same expression trends. (K) The pathways associated with early adipogenesis
  (bar: −log10 p-value; line: gene counts, dashed line: p < 0.05). (L) GO analysis
  and KEGG enrichment of 213 genes overlapping in (I). (Blue: thermogenic pathway;
  Red: adipogenic pathway; Green: PPAR signaling; Orange: other pathway in GO analysis;
  Rose red: other pathway in KEGG).'
