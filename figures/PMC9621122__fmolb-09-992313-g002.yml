caption: 'Apoptosis assay by annexin-V IP. (A) Cytometry plots for C2-ceramide (C2-C)
  with Log FL4 channel (IP) vs. Log FL1 channel (Annexin-v). (B) Stacked-bar graph
  for cells treated with C2-C in a concentration of 25 µM. Percentages of each population
  are represented from a parent population previously defined. (C) Cytometry plots
  for thapsigargin (THAP) with Log FL4 channel (IP) vs. Log FL1 channel (Annexin-v).
  (D) Stacked-bar graph for cells treated with THAP in a concentration of 100 nM.
  Percentages of each population are represented from a parent population previously
  defined. This experiment was carried out in triplicate and repeated 3 times on different
  days (N = 3, n = 3). *: adj. p-value < 0.05, **: adj. p-value < 0.01, ***: adj.
  p-value < 0.001, ****: adj. p-value < 0.0001.'
