caption: '“↑”: activation of the signaling pathway will promote the cell behavior;
  “↓”: activation of the signaling pathway will inhibit the cell behavior. miR-944
  is involved in the regulation of three signaling pathways. miR-944 plays a regulatory
  role in the occurrence and development of cancer by participating in the Wnt/β-catenin,
  PI3K/AKT, and Jak/STAT signaling pathways.'
