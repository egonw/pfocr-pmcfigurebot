caption: Nestin promotes CRC cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis. (A) The efficiency
  of nestin knockdown was examined through RT-qPCR and western blot assays; (B) the
  viability of Caco-2 and RKO cells transfected with nestin siRNAs was measured through
  CCK-8 assay at related times; (C) EdU staining evaluates the proliferation of Caco-2
  and RKO cells transfected with nestin siRNAs; (D) the expression level of cleaved-caspase
  3 was evaluated by western blot assay. ***, P<0.001 vs. NC. All data are presented
  as mean ± SD. n=3. CRC, colorectal cancer; RT-qPCR, quantitative reverse transcription
  polymerase chain reaction; OD, optical density; EdU, 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine;
  NC, negative control.
article_title: Nestin protein affects the maintenance of stem characteristics of colorectal
  cancer cells based on p53 dependent pathway.
