caption: Persistent genes and signalling pathways in osteoarthritis (OA) subchondral
  bone. a) The volcano plots of top 30 upregulated or downregulated differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) in the comparisons of OA lateral tibial plateau (LT) versus
  healthy LT, OA medial tibial plateau (MT) versus healthy MT, and OA MT versus OA
  LT, respectively. b) The common genes of three comparisons, including 52 common
  upregulated and 25 downregulated genes. The 77 genes were defined as the persistent
  OA-relevant genes independent of regions. c) The heatmap plot of the persistent
  genes (the top 25 upregulated and top ten downregulated genes). Rank score was estimated
  by robust rank aggregation (RRA) method. Smaller rank score indicates greater significance
  in the comparison. d) Independent dataset validation of the top ten persistent genes
  based on the estimated rank score. OA versus sham; *p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; all p-values
  estimated by unpaired two-tailed t-test. e) Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways of the persistent genes. GeneRatio indicates
  the gene number ration in each GO term or KEGG pathway. The colour and size of each
  dot represents a p-value adjusted by Benjamini & Hochberg method and gene number
  assigned to the corresponding GO term and KEGG pathway, respectively.
