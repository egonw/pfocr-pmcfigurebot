caption: ICOS pathway of peripheral T cells activated by MWA of breast cancer. (A)
  Unsupervised clustering of T cells in patients with early-stage breast cancer pre-MWA
  and post-MWA. Large cell populations are highlighted. (B) The relative mRNA expressions
  of the ICOS pathway in peripheral T cells before and after MWA (n=6). (C) MWA-induced
  Th1-type immune response via ICOS pathway. IFN-Î³, interferon gamma; ICOS, inducible
  co-stimulator; IL, interleukin; MWA, microwave ablation; NS, not significant.

  of ICOS pathway in early-stage breast cancer.
