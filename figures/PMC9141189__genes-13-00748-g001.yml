caption: Suppressors of the temperature sensitivity phenotype of the bud27Δ mutant.
  (A) List of suppressors. Rapamycin sensitivity was strongly (+++), moderately (++),
  weakly (+), or not (−) overcome by suppressors. (B) Possible functional interactions
  between suppressors. Genes are grouped by their GO-Terms, and related cellular processes
  are enclosed together. Intersections indicate a functional or genetic relation.
  Red denotes genes that are putative suppressors.
