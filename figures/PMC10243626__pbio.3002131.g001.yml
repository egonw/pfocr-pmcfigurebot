figure_title: Analysis of the OG biosynthesis pathway
caption: (a) Plant and pharmacological effects of C. orchioides. (b) Metabolic pathway
  analysis of OG. ORS, orcinol synthase; UGTs, UDP-glycosyltransferases. (c) Content
  of orcinol and OG in the roots and leaves of C. orchioides. All data represent the
  means from n = 3 biologically independent samples and error bars indicate the standard
  deviations. The circles represent the raw data and listed in the . (d) Functional
  annotation of unigenes obtained from C. orchioides.
