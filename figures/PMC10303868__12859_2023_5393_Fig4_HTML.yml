caption: Associating Immune Scores with Patient Survival. A Skin Cancer Patients treated
  with ICI dichotemized based on xCell derived Immune Scores as well as M2 Macrophage
  estimated from Cibersort. Patients with High Immune Score and Low M2 Macrophage
  were associated with better survival. B User Interface that access this function
  from the Shiny App is (1) Select Feature Condition to restrict to pretreated patients,
  (2) Multivariate Coxh Analysis, (3) Bivariate Interaction Survival Analysis, (4)
  Select Immune Score (on left) and M2 Macrophage (on right). The feature can be dichotemized
  “on-the-fly” if it is a continuous variable (4)
