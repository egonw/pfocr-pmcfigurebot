caption: AIM2 knockdown suppresses in vivo tumor proliferation. (∗P < 0.05, Data obtained
  from three independent are represented as means and standard errors.) (a-c) Nude
  mice were implanted with control or AIM2-knockdown MGC803 cells. Tumor volume and
  weight were then measured. (d) Phosphorylated p-ERK, p-JNK and p-p38levels in control
  and AIM2-knockdown tumors were assessed via immunohistochemistry.
