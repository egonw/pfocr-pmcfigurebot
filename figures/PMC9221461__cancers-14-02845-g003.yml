caption: Evaluation of the prognostic value of risk score. (a) Univariate analysis
  to dissect the factors significantly associated with OS. (b) Multivariate analysis
  to determine the independent prognostic factors. (c) Nomogram for the prediction
  of 3- and 5-year survival. (d) Calibration curves illustrate the concordance between
  predicted and actual survival possibilities within 3 and 5 years. (e) Decision curve
  analysis unveils that the combination of risk score and TNM stage is superior to
  TNM stage alone across threshold probabilities of survival between 18% and 80%.
  The grey and blue lines depict a ‘treat none’ strategy and ‘treat all’ strategy,
  respectively.
