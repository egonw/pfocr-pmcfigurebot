caption: Ethylene production and related gene expression in transgenic tomato fruits
  by four-gene co-silencing. a Ethylene production of fruits in transgenic lines during
  fruit ripening, using WT as control. The number of fruits for each group was set
  to 30, and values represent mean ± standard deviation. b Relative expression of
  genes involved in the ethylene biosynthesis and signaling pathway of transgenic
  fruit at the breaker stage using WT as control. T-11, T-12, T-13, transgenic lines.**P < .01
  by t-test.
