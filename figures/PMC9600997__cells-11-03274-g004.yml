caption: Rapid induction of the mitochondrial (intrinsic) apoptotic pathway and role
  of caspase activation in cell death. (a) Expression of Bax and Bak proteins was
  detected in controls (‘C’) versus mCD40L-treated (‘mL’) HCT116 and SW480-CD40 cells
  by immunoblotting at the indicated time points. Equal loading for human epithelial
  cell lysate was confirmed by CK18 detection. (b) Control (‘C’) and mCD40L-treated
  (‘mL’) HCT116 and SW480-CD40 cells were used to prepare cytoplasmic (‘Cyto’) and
  mitochondrial (‘Mito’) sub-cellular fractions for the detection of cytochrome c
  (Cyto c) protein by immunoblotting at 6 h post CD40 ligation. Detection of Bcl-2
  and GAPDH proteins was employed to confirm sub-cellular fractionation (mitochondrial
  and cytoplasmic, respectively). (c) HCT116 cells were treated with mCD40L in the
  absence (vehicle control–denoted ‘Control’) or presence of 100 µM inhibitor of caspase-8
  (z-IETD-FMK), caspase-9 (z-LEHD-FMK), caspase-10 (z-AEVD-FMK) or pan-caspase inhibitor
  (z-VAD-FMK). Cell death was detected 24 h later using the CytoTox-Glo assay. Results
  are presented as Cell death Fold increase in background-corrected RLU readings relative
  to control (mCD40L treatment versus controls) and are representative of 3 independent
  experiments. Bars show mean fold change (comparing caspase inhibitor-treated versus
  vehicle control cultures) for 5–6 technical replicates ± SEM. NS denotes non-significance
  (p > 0.05) and *** p < 0.001.
