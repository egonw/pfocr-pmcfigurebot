caption: 'Changes in activities of HK (A), PFK (B), and PK (C) of bovine muscle when
  stored at 4 °C for 0.5, 2, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h after treatment with 200 μM H2O2
  (H2O2 group) and saline (control group). Data were expressed as mean ± standard
  error (n = 6). The capital letters and lowercase letters represent the significant
  difference (P < 0.01) in the same group at different times, respectively. ** (P < 0.01)
  represents the difference between the two groups at the same time point. HK: hexokinase,
  PFK: phosphofructokinase, and PK: pyruvate kinase.'
