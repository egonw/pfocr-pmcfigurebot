caption: The effect of andrographolide in reducing migration of DBTRG-05MG cell lines.
  (A) The closure of the wound-healing area after 24, 48, and 72 h of DBTRG-05MG cell
  line treated with 13.95 μM andrographolide and without andrographolide as the control.
  (B) The % comparison of wound closure area of DBTRG-05MG cell lines when treated
  and untreated with andrographolide at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h. Data expressed as mean
  ± SEM and statistical analysis between three independent groups were performed by
  multiple t-tests compared with the control group (* p < 0.005, ** p < 0.0005).
