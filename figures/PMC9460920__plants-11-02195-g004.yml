caption: Sarcopoterium spinosum L. extract activates the anti-viral response. (A)
  Real-Time PCR measurement of mitochondrial (NDUFB11, COX5B, COX6B1) and γ-interferon-induced
  genes (IFIT1, IFIT2). *, p < 0.05; **** p < 0.001 (treated (sample) vs. control).
  (B) The extract protects from the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cells were pretreated with
  extract for 4 h, then SARS-CoV-2 virus was added to the cells, cell viability was
  measured by the MTT assay after 48 h. On the right viability of VERO6 cells, on
  the left viability of A549 cells have been described. Black—untreated control, Red—virus
  treatment only, Blue—virus + extract treatments.
