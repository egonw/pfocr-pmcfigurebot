figure_title: β-Catenin constitutive activation in myeloid cells promotes primary
  tumor growth and spontaneous lung metastasis in the E0771.ML-1 model
caption: (A) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis of genes associated
  with poor overall survival in breast cancer patients from TCGA database, identified
  through OncoLnc by positive Cox regression score. (B) Correlation between high and
  low Wnt3a-expressing breast cancer and OS, based on upper and lower tertile cutoffs.
  (C) Primary tumor growth of orthotopically implanted E0771.ML-1 tumor cells in β-catenin–activated
  C57BL/6 Lyz2-Cre+/+ Ctnnb1Ex3Δ/Δ (βcat.CA) or Ctnnb1Ex3Δ/Δ floxed control (Ex3.Flox)
  C57BL/6 mice. (D) Spontaneous histologic metastatic foci of E0771.ML-1 tumor–bearing
  mice at endpoint. (E) H&E-stained lung sections from mice in D representative of
  2 independent experiments; red arrows highlight E0771.ML-1 metastatic foci at 4×
  original magnification. (C and D) The mean ± SEM values are shown and represent
  4–6 individual mice. Statistical analysis is based on 2-way ANOVA (C) and 2-tailed
  t test (D); * = P < 0.05.
