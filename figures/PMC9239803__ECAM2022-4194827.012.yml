caption: Effects of Dahuang-Huangqi decoction (DHHQD) on PI3K-AKT pathway signaling
  pathway. Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) rats were administered water or Dahuang-Huangqi
  decoction (DHHQD) at 20 mL·kg−1·d−1 by oral gavage for 14 d Sham group rats were
  administered equal volumes of water. (a) mRNA expression of inflammation-related
  genes in DHHQD-administered rats compared to that in UUO rats was determined using
  quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses.
  Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as the internal reference.
  (b, c) Protein expression levels were determined using western blotting. Data are
  presented as mean ± SEM. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01.
