caption: 'Metformin failed to activate Nrf2 in presence of Compound C(CC), an AMPK
  inhibitor. SRA-hLECs (A) and mLECs (B) were culture in 60 mm culture plate overnight,
  next day cells were treated with an AMPK inhibitor Compound C (CC) and followed
  by Metformin for 24 h as indicated. Total proteins were isolated and processed for
  SDS-PAGE immunoblotting with phospho-AMPKα (SRA-hLECs: (A,a) and mLECs: (B,a)),
  AMPKα (SRA-hLECs: (A,b) and mLECs: (B,b)) and Nrf2 (SRA-hLECs: (A,c) and mLECs:
  (B,c)) antibodies for protein expression analyses as shown in Figure. Below the
  protein bands, densitometric analysis of the protein band value normalized with
  corresponding tubulin and were presented as histograms. Figure (A) (SRA-hLECs) and
  (B) (mLECs) show increased phosphorylated form of AMPKα and Nrf2 (second lane in
  each figure) in response to Metformin treatment. However, Metformin failed to activate
  the AMPK and Nrf2 in presence of CC, an AMPK inhibitor (last lanes in each figure).
  Histograms are presented as mean ± S.D. values derived from three independent experiments,
  ** p < 0.001.'
