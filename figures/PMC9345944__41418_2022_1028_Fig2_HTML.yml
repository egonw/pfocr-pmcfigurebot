figure_title: Pathophysiological functions and importance of the TFEB protein
caption: TFEB regulates the lysosomal biogenesis & autophagy pathway, which is crucial
  for proper tissue-specific regulation and TFEB-mediated intracellular clearance
  of toxic protein aggregates (upper panel). The number of research articles has increased
  along with the interest in and perceived importance of the TFEB protein (bottom
  panel).
