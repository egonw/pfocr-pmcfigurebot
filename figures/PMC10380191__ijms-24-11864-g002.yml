caption: Representation of the molecular mechanisms of NRC-03-induced apoptosis and
  cell death in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. The cationic nature of
  NRC-03 grants this cationic AMP to purposefully target negatively charged cancer
  cells, such as OSCC. NRC-03 easily enters the cancerous cells and has three main
  targets within these cells. They were shown to be bound to the cell membrane, nucleus,
  and mitochondria. Two pathways thus ensue wherein the cell death/apoptotic pathway
  NRC-03 bound to the nucleus results in DNA fragmentation while the cell-membrane-bound
  NRC-03 has been shown to increase the prevalence of blebbing. More importantly,
  Hou et al., (2022) [], noted that NRC-03-induced expression of CypD has been shown
  to cause the prolonged opening of the mPTP channel, which leads to the increased
  efflux of calcium (Ca2+) and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) into the cytosol. This
  prolonged CypD-dependent opening of the mPTP channel thus caused mitochondrial dysfunction,
  swelling, and rupture, supplementing cell death in the OSCC cells. Hence, Hou et
  al., (2022) [], stated that the molecular mechanism of NRC-03-induced cell death
  is mainly caused by the mitochondrial oxidative stress-mediated altered mitochondrial
  function.
