caption: '3D retinal organoids generated from H9 hESCs contain major retinal cell
  types arranged in proper layers. (A) A scheme of retinal organoids generated by
  hESCs H9. (B) hESCs H9 were stained for OCT4 and CXCR4. (C) After 10 weeks of differentiation,
  retinal organoids contained major cell types of retinal cells, including progenitor
  cells (MCM2-positive), ganglion cells (HuD-positive), amacrine cells (AP-2α-positive),
  and photoreceptor cells (OTX2-positive), and showed a normal axon pathway (NEFL
  staining). Scale bars: 100 μm (B,C).'
