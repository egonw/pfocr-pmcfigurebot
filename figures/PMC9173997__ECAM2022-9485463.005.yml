caption: Effect of GXP on PI3K/Akt pathway on the expression of related proteins.
  GXP inhibited the activation of ET-1 to PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. The protein
  expression levels of PI3K, Akt, pAkt, IκB-α, Bax/Bcl-2, and iNOS were determined
  by Western blotting. The graphs represent the relative activity of these proteins
  for three independent experiments. (a) The band and molecular weight of each protein
  in Western blotting; (b) the relative expression of each protein in the physiological
  group; (c) the relative expression of each protein in the pathological group. In
  the physiological group, other groups were compared with the control group, and
  in the pathological group, other groups were compared with the model group (ET-1
  group),∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 compared with the model group (ET-1 group).
