caption: Si-Miao-Yong-an (SMYA) inhibits vasa vasorum angiogenesis through the Wnt1/β-catenin
  signalling pathway. SMYA is Composed of honeysuckle, Radix Scrophulariae, Angelica,
  and licorice. Chlorogenic acid, harpagoside, ferulic acid, and glycyrrhizic acid
  are the main active components of SMYA in the treatment of atherosclerosis. This
  study confirmed that SMYA can reduce foam cell infiltration, lipid deposition, and
  smooth muscle cell proliferation, thereby reducing the ratio of plaque area (PA)
  to lumen area (LA) (PA/LA), which may be related to SMYA inhibiting vasa vasorum
  angiogenesis through the Wnt1/β-catenin signalling pathway. The molecular structure
  of the main active components of SMYA is derived from the Traditional Chinese Medicine
  systems pharmacology database and analysis platform (https://old.tcmsp-e.com/tcmsp.php).
