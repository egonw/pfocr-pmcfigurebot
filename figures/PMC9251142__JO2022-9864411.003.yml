caption: MSTO2P and miR-128-3p regulated TGF-β pathway (a) TGFBR1, Smad2, Smad5 and
  Smad9 were identified as targets of miR-128-3p by TargetScan. (b–e) RT-qPCR showed
  that TGFBR1, Smad2, Smad5 and Smad9 levels in A549 cells transfected with NC mimic,
  miR-128-3p mimic, NC inhibitor, miR-128-3p inhibitor. ∗∗∗P < 0.001, miR-128-3p mimic
  group vs. NC mimic group, miR-128-3p inhibitor group vs. NC inhibitor group. (f–i)
  RT-qPCR showed that TGFBR1, Smad2, Smad5 and Smad9 levels in A549 cells transfected
  with si-NC or si-MSTO2P. ∗∗∗P < 0.001, si-MSTO2P group vs. Si-NC group.
