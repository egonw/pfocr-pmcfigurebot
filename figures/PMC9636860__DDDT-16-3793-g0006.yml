caption: Schematic illustration of the potential protective mechanism of MA in OA.
  On the one hand, MA inhibited the activation of NF-κB signaling pathways which induced
  by IL-1β. (labeled as “a” in red font). On the other hand, MA could promote the
  PI3K/AKT pathway which inhibited by IL-1β, (labeled as “b” in blue font). MA’s inhibition
  effect on NF-κB pathway was stronger than the promotion effect on PI3K/AKT, and
  finally resulting in the inflammation inhibition and ECM anabolism in IL-1β-induced
  chondrocyte.
