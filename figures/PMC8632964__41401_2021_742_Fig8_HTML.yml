figure_title: EF protecteds against LPS-induced ALI in mice is dependent on the Nrf2
  pathway
caption: 'Nrf2−/− mice were subjected to an intratracheal injection of LPS (5 mg/kg)
  and subsequent intraperitoneal injection of vehicle (polyoxyethylene castor oil:
  ethanol: PBS = 1:1:8) or EF (50 mg/kg). Six hours later, the mice were sacrificed,
  and the lung lobes and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected. a The
  lung lobes were fixed, and hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed to evaluate
  the lung histopathological changes (original magnification, ×100). b The lung injury
  score was calculated by histological analysis in different groups. c The total protein
  concentration in the BALF supernatant was measured to determine lung permeability
  with a BCA kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. d MPO expression in
  lung tissue was detected by immunohistochemical localization. e–g TNF-α (e), IL-1β
  (f), and IL-6 (g) mRNA in the lungs was quantified by real-time PCR. The data represent
  the mean ± SEM, for (a–d), n = 5 per group; for (e–g), n = 4.   **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001,
  ns means no significant difference.'
