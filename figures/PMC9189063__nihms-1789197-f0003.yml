figure_title: Regulation of IFN-β basal expression through TLR4/TBK/IRF3 pathway
caption: (A-B) Signals derived from commensal bacteria maintains IFN-β basal expression
  through TLR4/TBK/IRF3 pathway. Basal IFN-β promotes the expression of immune modulatory
  ISGs, as well as provide awareness and protection against microbial (bacteria &
  viruses) infections.(C-D) Disruption of the TLR4/TBK/IRF3 pathway, e.g., viral infections,
  blocks IFN-β basal expression in trophoblast cells, leading to decreased protection
  against pathogenic bacteria and a shift towards the NF-κB pathway and induction
  of a cytokine storm of pro-inflammatory factors such as IL-1β and TNFα.LPS, lipopolysaccharides;
  TLR4, toll like receptor 4; TBK1, TANK binding kinase 1; IKKi, inhibitor of nuclear
  factor kappa B kinase subunit epsilon; IRF, interferon regulatory factor; IFN-β,
  interferon-β; ISGs, interferon stimulated genes; NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappa-B;
  PIGs, pro-inflammatory genes. P, phosphorylation. Figure created with BioRender.com
