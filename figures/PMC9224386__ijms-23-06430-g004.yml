caption: 'LPS injection promotes cytokine and inflammatory pathways. Transcriptome
  analyses were made from whole heart of rats injected with LPS (LPS) or saline (CTRL),
  and this allowed the identification of 13730 genes. Differentially expressed genes
  (DEGs) were selected by their fold change of expression (log2Ratio(LPS/CTRL) >1
  or (log2Ratio(LPS/CTRL) >−1 and an adjusted p value < 0.05 using the R package “Deseq2”.
  KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) enrichments were conducted to decipher
  most impacted pathways. Represented here are 4 main pathways in the heart that were
  impacted by LPS injection in CTRL rats: the MAPK signaling pathway (rno04010), the
  JAK-STAT signaling pathway (rno04630), and the NF-κB signaling pathway (rno04064).
  Each DEGs expression in pathways is represented in a heatmap.'
