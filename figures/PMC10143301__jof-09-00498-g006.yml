caption: 'Hydroxyl radical sample spectrum compared with theoretical simulation (A,B)
  and relative amplitude (C,D) generated from LMWCs redox cycle with iron, analyzed
  using spin-trapping in EPR. Values are the means ± standard deviation: for the reaction
  at pH 3.5 (C; n = 4), results from negative controls (C(-)) and Fmed average values
  are shown on the left. Results from different Fmed strains (Fm1, Fm2, Fm3, Fm4,
  Fm5, and Fm6) were analyzed using the Kruskal–Wallis test, followed by Dunn’s multiple
  comparison tests (p < 0.05). Different letters indicate significant differences
  according to multiple comparison test results. For the reaction at pH 5.5 (D; n
  = 3), results were analyzed by the unpaired two-tailed t-test (p < 0.05). Asterisks
  indicate significance: ****, p < 0.0001. nd = not detected.'
