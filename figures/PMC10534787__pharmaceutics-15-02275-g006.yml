caption: PEG-ZnPP-SDT activated mitochondriaâ€“caspase pathway via ROS. (A) Representative
  fluorescence images of cytochrome c translocation in SKOV3 cells after SDT treatment.
  In the NAC-untreated US + PEG-ZnPP group, cytochrome c (red fluorescence) diffused
  in the cytoplasm (long arrow), while it was immobilized in the mitochondria (short
  arrow) in the control and NAC-treated US + PEG-ZnPP groups. (B) Expression of caspase-3
  in SKOV3 cells was measured with the GreenNuc kit. The activity of caspase-3 (green
  fluorescence) in the US + PEG-ZnPP group was significantly higher than that in other
  groups.
