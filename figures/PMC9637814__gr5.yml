caption: Phosphorylation of PKM2 at T45 is critical for Aurora A–mediated tumor proliferation.A,
  Flag-Aurora A or kinase dead Aurora A (KD-Aurora A) were overexpressed in H1299 cells
  that had endogenous PKM2 knocked down and expressed shRNA-resistant Flag PKM2 WT
  or Flag-PKM2 T45A. The extracts of these cells were immunoblotted with the indicated
  antibodies. B, cell proliferation assay was conducted with the H1299 cells tested
  in (A) (n = 2). C, H1299 cells tested in (A) were inoculated in nude mice. The tumors
  at the endpoint (left panel), the growth curve of the xenograft (middle panel),
  and the weight of tumors (right panel) were shown (n = 6). D, a working model summarizes
  the function of Aurora A-PKM2 pathway in the regulation of Warburg effect in cancer
  cells.
