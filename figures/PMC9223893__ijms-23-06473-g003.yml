caption: Differentially expressed genes in HNSC patients with a higher RvD score are
  associated with modulation of the immune-inflammatory reaction. (A) Volcano plot
  (prepared with VolcaNorseR) of gene expression patterns reporting up- down- (254
  transcripts) or up- (2304 transcripts) regulated genes in patients with a high RvD
  score with a Â±2 fold-change cut-off (corresponding to 1 in the log2 scale reported
  in the figure) and q-value < 0.05. (B) Top down (green arrows) and up-regulated
  genes in patients with a high RvD score. (C) Graphical summary of the major biological
  themes in high RvD tumors as determined by IPA core analysis of differentially expressed
  genes filtered as described above. The inset shows key legends. Solid lines represent
  direct interactions, while dashed lines represent indirect interactions. (D) Gene
  ontology (GO) of enriched biological themes in high vs. low RvD score patients identified
  by DAVID. Shown are GO Term, total and percentage of differentially expressed genes
  and False Discovery Rate (FDR).
