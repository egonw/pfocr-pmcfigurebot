caption: DKK4 regulates Wnt/β-catenin and AKT signaling in CRC cells.A, heatmap showing
  that 18 genes were upregulated and 24 genes were downregulated at the mRNA level
  after DKK4 knockdown in HCT116 cells. The cut-off value was a twofold expression
  change, and the scale bar shows color-coded differences in expression from the mean.
  B, the enriched pathways analyzed by KEGG database. C, AKT2 expression was measured
  by qRT‒PCR in Caco-2 and HCT8 cells infected with LV-DKK4 or negative controls (above)
  and in SW480 and HCT116 cells infected with LV-shDKK4 or negative controls (below).
  ∗∗p < 0.01. D, FZD6 expression was measured by qRT‒PCR in Caco-2 and HCT8 cells
  infected with LV-DKK4 or negative controls (above) and in SW480 and HCT116 cells
  infected with LV-shDKK4 or negative controls (below). ∗∗p < 0.01. E, JUN expression
  was measured by qRT‒PCR in Caco-2 and HCT8 cells infected with LV-DKK4 or negative
  controls (above) and in SW480 and HCT116 cells infected with LV-shDKK4 or negative
  controls (below). ∗∗p < 0.05. F, Western blot analysis of the expression of AKT2,
  FZD6, and JUN in Caco-2 and HCT8 cells infected with LV-DKK4 or negative controls
  (above) and in SW480 and HCT116 cells infected with LV-shDKK4 or negative controls
  (below). G, Western blot analysis of the expression of Wnt and AKT signaling- and
  metastasis-related proteins in Caco-2 and HCT8 cells infected with LV-DKK4 or negative
  controls and in SW480 and HCT116 cells infected with LV-shDKK4 or negative controls.
