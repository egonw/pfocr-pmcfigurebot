caption: 'ICM-enhanced heatmap depicting IPA biological functions for ICM-enhanced
  genes; entries were limited to those present in at least two datasets in the full
  analysis. Figure consists of two wrapped columns for the full and homology methods.
  Along the top x-axis, each column is further divided by dataset: 3&4* DEGs shared
  by at least three species and the whole species DEG lists for human, mouse, cow,
  and pig. Along the y-axis are the identified biological functions. Level of significant
  overlap was set at P < 0.05; entries with white color denote those not meeting significance.
  Data generated from Supplemental Table S16. DEG, differentially expressed gene;
  ICM, inner cell mass; IPA, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.'
