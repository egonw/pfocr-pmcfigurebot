caption: 'Resveratrol inactivates serum-induced the AKT signaling pathway in PC-3
  cells. Cells were treated with serum with or without RES for 24 h. The same amount
  of proteins (25–30 μg) were analyzed by Western blot using the phospho-AKT, AKT
  (A), MMP-2 (B) and LAMC2 (D) antibodies. As a loading control, β-actin was used.
  (C) Gelatin zymography was performed using the CM. Data present as the means ± SD
  of three independent experiments by analysis of Student’s t-test. ***p < 0.001 versus
  untreated control; ##p < 0.01 and ###p < 0.001 versus serum-treated control.'
article_title: Resveratrol suppresses serum-induced vasculogenic mimicry through impairing
  the EphA2/twist-VE-cadherin/AKT pathway in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells.
