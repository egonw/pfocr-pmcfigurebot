caption: Diagrammatic pathway related to the effects of QC as both antioxidant, and
  pro-antioxidant in the presence of low and high levels of reduced GSH, both effects
  are strongly dependent upon the reduced GSH enzyme. During oxidative stress, in
  the presence of peroxidase, QC reacts with H2O2 to form a semiquinone radical that
  is rapidly oxidized to QQ, has a pro-oxidant effect, high reactivity towards protein
  thiols, and DNA leads to cell damage, and cytotoxicity. QQ preferentially reacts
  with GSH to stable protein oxidized QC adducts namely 6-GSQ, and 8-GSQ. In the presence
  of high GSH concentration, QQ reacts with GSH to form GSQ, and QQ cannot exert its
  cytotoxic effects, by contrast QQ reacts with protein thiols, and leading to cellular
  damage in the depletion of the GSH enzyme level.
