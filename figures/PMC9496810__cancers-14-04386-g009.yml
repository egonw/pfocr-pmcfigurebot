caption: 'Secondary pathway assay for a representative and optimized SFRP1 mimetic
  hit, showing potential regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling in BT20 breast
  cancer cells. DMSO (lanes 1, 2, 3) serves as negative diluent control and ICG-001
  (lanes 4, 5, 6) as reference drug. (A,B) Protein expression of the phosphorylated
  LRP6 receptor (P-LRP6) shows significant down-regulation in the presence of LDC066
  (LDC066 is an optimized analog of an SFRP1 mimetic screening hit, lanes 7, 8, 9),
  but not by ICG-001. All compounds are added as triplicates (ICG-001 at 20 µM, LDC066
  at 10 µM). (C,D) Protein expression of the transcription factor cyclin D1 is significantly
  downregulated by ICG-001 and LDC066 since both substances down-regulate the Wnt
  signaling cascade at the level of gene transcription, and cyclin D1 is a TCF/CBP-regulated
  gene. (E) Cartoon of active Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade. LDC066 seems to down-regulate
  the active LRP6 receptor (“P-LRP6”) at the cell surface, while the reference drug
  ICG-001 antagonizes the TCF/β-catenin/CBP-dependent transcription in the cell nucleus.
  Consequently, both drugs mediate down-regulation of the oncogenic transcription
  factor cyclin D1, a key transcription factor in active Wnt signaling. (ns: not significant,
