caption: 'Diel patterns of organ growth and management of carbon (C) resources are
  modulated by the photoperiod, the clock, and the target of rapamycin complex (TORC).
  (A) Upper panel: Plant organs grow at a different pace along the 24 h diel cycle.
  The relative expansion rate of rosette (green), root extension rate (brown), and
  hypocotyl elongation rate (grey) are depicted for Arabidopsis Col-0 plants grown
  under 12 h light/12 h dark conditions. Growth profiles are based on , , and , respectively.
  In the light period, C resources and light signals promote growth in the early morning
  in both leaf and root organs. In hypocotyls, however, light strongly inhibits elongation
  via the degradation of PIFs. During the remainder of the light period, rosettes
  maintain a steady rate of extension, whereas root growth declines. During the night,
  rosettes, roots, and hypocotyls differ in their growth patterns. Whereas the rosette
  extension rate peaks 2 h after dusk and then declines, root growth increases steadily
  during the night, while hypocotyl elongation occurs in the second half of the dark
  period. These diel growth patterns display a similar trend both under short and
  long photoperiods, although with some specific variations (see main text for details).
  Lower panel: When C partitioning is considered, during the light period photosynthates
  are partitioned towards sugars or stored in the leaves as starch. This starch will
  be used at night to fuel growth and maintain metabolism at the whole-plant level.
  Consequently, starch accumulates during the light period and is broken down during
  the dark period. Arabidopsis is an annual species under selective pressure to optimize
  C usage () and it will rely on the circadian clock and light signalling pathways
  to coordinate starch turnover with photoperiod (data modified from ). Therefore,
  as the length of the light period shortens, the rate of starch synthesis increases.
  In contrast, as the length of the night increases, the rate of starch breakdown
  slows down to ensure that there are enough C resources for the long night. (B) Plants
  possess sensors such as the TORC, which is able to integrate external signals with
  the internal energy status of the plant to coordinate growth. The TORC is activated
  by light and sugars to mediate anabolic growth processes. Disruption of TORC function
  is known to impair growth in leaves, hypocotyls, and roots. Upper panel: When the
  root extension patterns of Col-0 and raptor1B (raptor) mutants grown under long
  photoperiods were compared, the mutant showed a delay in the early morning peak
  and root extension was reduced, particularly in the second part of the light period
  and shortly after dusk (modified from (). Lower panel: Along with this impaired
  growth phenotype, raptor mutants exhibited an excess of starch accumulation in both
  light and dark periods under long-day conditions, suggesting a deficiency in C resource
  management (modified from ). Image created with BioRender.com.'
