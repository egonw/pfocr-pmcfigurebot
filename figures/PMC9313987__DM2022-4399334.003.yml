caption: 'Evodiamine displays antiproliferative effect on DU145 cells. (a) DU145 cells
  were treated with 5 potential active compounds at different concentrations (0, 0.625,
  1.25, 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 μM) for 72 h. The cell viability was detected by CCK8 assay.
  Among these compounds, evodiamine (chemical structure in ) displays the most potent
  cytotoxicity. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3). ∗∗P < 0.01 and ∗∗∗P < 0.001
  versus the control group. (c) DU145 cells were treated with different concentrations
  of evodiamine for 24 h. The cell viability was detected by CCK8 assay. The curve
  indicated that E2 exerts antiproliferative effect on DU145 cells in a dose-dependent
  manner. (d) Representative images of CCK8 assay. Original magnification: 100x; scale
  bar: 100 μm. (e) DU145 cells were exposed to evodiamine at the concentrations of
  0, 1.25, 2.5, and 5.0 μM for 48 h and then cultured in fresh medium which was replaced
  every three days. After ten days, the colonies of DU145 cells were visualized by
  crystal violet staining. (f) The numbers of colonies of DU145 cells were counted
  and presented as mean ± SD (n = 3). ∗∗∗P < 0.001 versus the control group.'
