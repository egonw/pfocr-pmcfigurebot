caption: 'involvement of LXRα in the induction of ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression by baicalein.
  (A) THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells were incubated with PBS or 100 μM baicalein
  for 24 h, followed by measurement of LXRα expression using qRT-PCR and western blot.
  (B–E) THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells were transfected with scrambled siRNA
  or LXRα siRNA for 48 h and then incubated with or without 100 μM baicalein for 24
  h. (B) Cell lysates were subjected to western blot analysis to assess the protein
  levels of LXRα. (C–D) The expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 were evaluated using qRT-PCR
  and western blot. (E) Cholesterol efflux to apoA-I and HDL was detected by the liquid
  scintillation counting method. Data are expressed as mean ± SD from three independent
  experiments. **P < 0.01 vs control group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 vs baicalein group.'
article_title: Baicalein inhibits macrophage lipid accumulation and inflammatory response
  by activating the PPARγ/LXRα pathway.
