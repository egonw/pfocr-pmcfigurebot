figure_title: Sema3C promotes β-catenin nuclear localization
caption: 'a Western blots of β-catenin in cytosolic and nuclear fractions (left) of
  GSCs after Sema3C knockdown (right). Western blots were repeated at least twice.
  b Quantification of nuclear β-catenin positive cells of GSCs expressing FLAG vector
  or FLAG-Sema3C (n = 3 independent experiments in 387 GSCs Two-tailed T-test p = 0.0066,
  error bars: S.D.; n = 4 independent experiments in 4121 GSCs, Two-tailed T-test
  p = 0.0088, error bars: S.D.). c, d Left panels: representative immunofluorescence
  images of β-catenin (green) in 387 (c) and 4121 (d) GSCs after control shNT and
  shSema3C knockdown. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). Right panels: quantification
  of nuclear β-catenin positive cell fraction (n = 3 independent experiments, Two-tailed
  T-test, p = 0.0012 (387 GSCs); p < 0.0001 (4121 GSCs) error bars: S.D. Scale bar
  50 μM). Source data are provided as a Source data file.'
