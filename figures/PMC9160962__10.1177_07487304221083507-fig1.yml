caption: 'of 1-carbon (folate and methyl) metabolism. Enzymes are shown in grayed
  rectangle, with the exception of SAM-dependent methyltransferases, collectively
  represented as “MTases” in a white rectangle. Enzymes using or generating folates
  and/or methyl groups, as well as enzymes directly dependent on the metabolites of
  the methyl cycle are represented. GCS is the glycine cleavage system; through its
  sulfur (S), GLDC forms a bound intermediate with glycine, further cleaved into CH2-THF
  and NH3 by the activity of the other enzymes in the complex, with regenerated GLDC(-SH).
  HISD is the histidine degradation pathway, ultimately leading to the degradation
  of formimino-glutamate (Glu) to CH +-THF mediated by FTCD. The information about
  enzymes mediating each step was obtained from the KEGG. Based on published reviews
  and pathways from public databases (; ; ; ; ). Abbreviations: SAM = S-adenosylmethionine;
