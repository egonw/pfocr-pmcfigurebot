caption: 'NF-kB luciferase activity in Response to LPS/CDDO-IM. CDDO-IM reduced LPS-mediated
  NF-kB Activity in NF-κB RAW264.7 macrophages. NF-κB RAW264.7 cells (1 × 105 cells/well)
  were plated in a 6-well format in assay medium and were pretreated with or without
  CDDO-IM at 400 nM for 24 h, followed by incubating the cells with 200 ng/mL LPS
  for another 3 h. Coelenterazine was then added as a substrate at a concentration
  of 1 µM and luminescence was read using the Biotech Synergy 2 plate reader. All
  data represent mean ± SEM (n = 3. *p < 0.05 vs control; #p < 0.05 vs LPS only).
  The differences between treatments were measured by one-way analysis of variance
  (ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. (A color version of this figure is available
  in the online journal.)'
