caption: Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of 57 patients
  with PCDLBCL-LT. The median OS of the cohort was 44 months. (A) The median PFS of
  the cohort was 17 months. (B) Rearrangements of MYC (C) and mutations in HIST1H1E
  (D) were associated with an inferior survival (Log rank; p = 0.001 and p = 0.00013,
  respectively). There were no statistically significant differences in OS for (E)
  patients with or without mutations in the B-cell receptor pathway (CD79A/B or CARD11)
  and (F) patients with a high (>6 mutations) or low (â‰¤6 mutations) mutational burden.
