caption: Supplementation with GGPP partially restores apoptosis induced by miR-874.
  (a) MCF-7 cells were transfected with control (cont) miRNA or miR-874, treated with
  mevalonate (MVA, 1 mM), mevalonate-5-phosphate (MVP, 0.5 mM), mevalonate-5-pyrophosphate
  (MVA-5PP, 0.5 mM), isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP, 15 μM), farnesyl pyrophosphate
  (FPP, 10 μM), or geranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP, 10 μM) for 72 h and subjected to the
  Alamar Blue assay. For mock samples, 70% methanol was added. Data are presented
  as the mean ± SD. ****p < 0.0001 (one-way ANOVA). (b) MCF-7 cells were transfected
  with cont miRNA or miR-874, treated with GGPP for 48 h, and subjected to annexin
  V-633/PI double staining with flow cytometry analysis. For the mock sample, 70%
  methanol was added. Representative images are shown. (c) The percentages of annexin
  V-633-negative/PI-negative cells (lower left, live cells), annexin V-633-positive/PI-negative
  cells (lower right, early apoptosis), and annexin V-633-positive/PI-positive cells
  (upper right, late apoptosis) were quantified. n = 4 per group. Data are presented
  as the mean ± SD. ****p < 0.0001 (one-way ANOVA). (d) MCF-7 cells were transfected
  with cont miRNA or miR-874 and treated with GGPP for 40 h. Western blotting was
  performed to analyse the effects of miR-874 transfection and GGPP treatment on c-Myc
  and p53 in MCF-7 cells. *indicates nonspecific bands, and triangles show bands for
  SREBP2. The numbers below the bands are the relative values of expression. (e) qRT-PCR
  analysis of PMVK, SREBF2, BAX, and PUMA in MCF-7 cells transfected with control
  or miR-874 for 48 h. Data are presented as the mean ± SD (n = 6, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ****p < 0.0001 by one-way ANOVA).
