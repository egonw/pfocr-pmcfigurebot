caption: Hsa_circ_0017728 knockdown suppressed proliferation and migration and induced
  apoptosis in GC cell lines. Transfection with specific siRNA into MKN-28 and MGC-803
  cells targeted hsa_circ_0017728; the expression level of hsa_circ_0017728 was measured
  by RT-qPCR (A); CCK-8 assay, scratch test and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining were performed
  to detect cell viability (B), migration (C) and apoptosis (D) in MKN-28 and MGC-803
  cells, respectively*P < 0.05, **p < 0.01 compared with control group.

  and modulating the IL-6/STAT3 pathway.
