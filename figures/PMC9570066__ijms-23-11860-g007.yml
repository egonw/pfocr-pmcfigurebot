caption: Relationships between TGF-β1/Smads, MAPK and Jak/Stat pathways involved in
  cell proliferation. Cell proliferation and apoptosis strictly regulate the homeostasis
  of intestinal cells. Signaling-coupled pathways that activate and promote cell proliferation
  and inhibit apoptosis act through TGF-β and RREB in response to stimulation by internal
  and external survival factors. TGF-β/Smad, ERK-MAPK activates CBP/p300 to promote
  cell transcriptional proliferation. Activation of the Jak-Stat pathway that phosphorylates
  STAT5 negatively regulates cellular transcription and prevents excessive cell proliferation.
