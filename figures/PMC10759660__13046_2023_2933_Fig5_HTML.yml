caption: 'In vitro effect of metformin and CR treatments on mTOR proliferative pathway:
  Representative immunoblot analysis of total and phosphorylated forms of P70 S6 kinase
  (P70) in KRASG12D (A) and KRASG12D/LKB1del(B) cell lines. C, D Bar graphs of the
  quantification analysis of the active forms of P70 normalized on RAN, used as housekeeping.
  Proteins were extracted after 72 h of treatment with 2 mM of metformin (MET) and
  50% caloric restriction (CR). Non-treated cells were used as control. One-way ANOVA
  was used for statistical analysis and no statistically significant results were
  highlighted. Error bars indicate SD'
article_title: Caloric restriction and metformin selectively improved LKB1-mutated
  NSCLC tumor response to chemo- and chemo-immunotherapy.
