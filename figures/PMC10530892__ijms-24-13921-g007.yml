caption: 'Foxg1 deletion leads to an imbalance of the regulatory mechanisms of myelination.
  (A–D) RT-qPCR analysis of the expression levels of genes involved in OL differentiation
  and myelination in control and Foxg1 cKO mice at P8, including: (A) genes that promote
  OL differentiation and myelination (Olig1, Olig2, Sox10, and Myrf), (B) genes that
  are components of the Notch signaling pathway (Notch1, Hes1, and Hes5), (C) genes
  that are components of the Wnt signaling pathway (Gsk3β, β-catenin, Wnt3a, and Tcf4),
  and (D) genes that inhibit myelination (Sox4, ID2, and ID4). (E) RT-qPCR analysis
  of the expression levels of Pdgfrα in control and Foxg1 cKO mice at P8 and P15.
  Data are normalized to GAPDH and expressed as fold change relative to control. n
  = 4 per group. Error bars represent SEM. ns, not significant, * p < 0.05, ** p <
  0.01, by Student’s t-test. (F) In situ hybridization of Pdgfrα mRNA (purple) in
  the forebrain sections of control and Foxg1 cKO mice at P8 and P15. Scale bar, 200
  μm. Black boxes indicate regions shown at higher magnification in the insets. Scale
  bar, 100 μm. CX, cortex; CC, corpus callosum; Str, striatum.'
