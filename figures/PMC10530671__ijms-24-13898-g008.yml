caption: 'Correlations between indicators were analyzed. CI index: chilling injury
  index; Total respiration rate: the amount of oxygen absorbed or carbon dioxide released
  per unit time; EMP pathway: Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas pathway; TCA cycle: tricarboxylic
  acid cycle; NAD content: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide content; NADH content:
  reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide content; HK activity: hexokinase activity;
  PFK activity: phosphofructokinase activity; PK activity: pyruvate kinase activity;
  CS activity: citrate synthase activity; α-KGDH activity: α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase
  activity; IDH activity: isocitrate dehydrogenase activity; SDH activity: succinate
  dehydrogenase activity; CpHK: the expression of hexokinase; CpPFK: the expression
  of phosphofructokinase; CpFK: the expression of pyruvate kinase; CpCS: the expression
  of citrate synthase; Cpα-KGDH: the expression of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase;
  CpIDH: the expression of isocitrate dehydrogenase; CpSDH: the expression of succinate
  dehydrogenase. Red coloration indicates positive correlations and blue coloration
  negative correlations. The intensity of the color is proportional to the degree
  of correlation.'
