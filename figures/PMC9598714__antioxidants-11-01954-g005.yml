caption: M6A RNA methylation modulated the NOD1/NF-κB signaling pathway. (A) Venn
  diagram showed the relationship between m6A modification and mRNA expression by
  the combined analysis of RNA-seq and MeRIP-seq. (B) The m6A peak profile on NOD1,
  RIPK2, NFKBIA, NFKBIB, and TNFAIP3 mRNAs were examined by IGV. Wathet blue, dark
  blue, and red patterning, respectively, represented m6A peaks on mRNA in the LPS,
  CON and input groups. (C) The METTL3 mRNA expression in the siControl and siMETTL3
  groups. (D) Effect of the knockdown of METTL3 on key genes of the NOD1/NF-κB signaling
  pathway in HepG2 cells. (E) The FTO mRNA expression in the OE-NC and OE-FTO groups.
  (F) Effect of the overexpression of FTO on key genes of the NOD1/NF-κB signaling
  pathway in HepG2 cells. Results are showed as means with SEM represented by a vertical
  bar (n = 3). * represents significant differences between the CON group and the
  LPS group; * p < 0.05, ** p< 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
