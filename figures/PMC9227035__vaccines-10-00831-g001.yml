caption: M1 macrophages infected with rBCG-LTAK63 display marked upregulation of genes
  associated with IFN signaling pathway. M1 macrophages from 4 different donors were
  infected with rBCG-LTAK63, BCG, or Mtb H37Rv, and transcriptomic profiles were determined
  at 24 h post-infection by dcRT-MLPA. (A) Venn diagram displaying the number of differentially
  expressed genes (p ˂ 0.05) identified in rBCG-LTAK63- or BCG-infected M1 macrophages
  (fold change in relation to uninfected M1 macrophages). (B) Heat map showing fold
  changes in expression profile of the 43 immune-related genes in M1 macrophages in
  response to infection with rBCG-LTAK63, BCG, or Mtb H37Rv. (C) Differentially expressed
  genes (p ˂ 0.05) in rBCG-LTAK63-infected M1 macrophages when compared to BCG-infected
  M1 cells. Statistical significance was determined by paired Student’s t-test. Significant
  differences were observed as indicated * p ˂ 0.05.
