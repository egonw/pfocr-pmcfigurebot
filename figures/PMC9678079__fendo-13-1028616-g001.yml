caption: RNA-Seq analysis of JOE cells. (A) Volcano plot of differentially expressed
  genes. Red dots are upregulated genes and blue dots are downregulated genes. (B)
  Venn Diagram showing the number of overlapping genes between JOE and ESR1 KD cells.
  (C) Representative figure showing enrichment of pathways in 4 subsets of 3412 overlapping
  genes from the JOE and ESR1 KD sets. 4 quadrants show the enrichment of pathways
  per subset of genes. Induced by JMJD6 and ESR1 (top right), induced by JMJD6 but
  suppressed by ESR1 (bottom right); and so on. Each panel depicts a bubble plot with
  number of genes in each pathway on the X-axis versus the name of the pathway on
  Y-axis. The pathway and bubble size key are indicated on the right.
article_title: JMJD6 orchestrates a transcriptional program in favor of endocrine
  resistance in ER+ breast cancer cells.
