caption: 'Expression pattern of total and phosphorylated YAP proteins in spontaneous
  cystic follicles in cows. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis was used to compare
  the cellular and subcellular localization of total and phospho-YAP (P-YAP; Ser 127)
  proteins in control non-cystic large follicles (A) and in spontaneous cystic follicles
  (B). The red lines differentiate the distinct cell layers observed in the images
  (G: granulosa cells; T: theca cells; S: stromal cells). Representative IHC images
  of staining for total and phospho-YAP (objective 63×) and their antibody control
  (NEG) showing negative staining of total YAP and phospho-YAP (objective 63×). Structure
  and cellular architecture of both groups can be observed in the H&E representative
  images.'
