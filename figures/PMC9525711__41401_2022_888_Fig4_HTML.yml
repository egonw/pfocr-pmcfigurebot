figure_title: TLB directly bound to HMGB1
caption: a Hypothetical complex of HMGB1 protein (blue) with TLB (green). a1 The whole
  view of the TLB dimer and HMGB1 displayed the molecular binding surface. a2 The
  substrate binding sites of TLB with HMGB1. a3 A close-up enlargement of the substrate
  binding pocket. a4 Two-dimensional interaction map for TLB onto HMGB1 protein binding
  site. b Sensor gram showed full kinetics between TLB and HMGB1. HMGB1 was directly
  immobilized in the sensor chip and TLB was flowed over the protein-coated chip at
  different analyte concentrations (from highest to lowest, 500, 250, 125, 62.5, 31.25,
  15.625, 7.81, 3.9, and 0 μM) with single-cycle kinetics. The experiment was performed
  using a Biacore X100 system, and the Biacore evaluation analysis software was used
  to determine the accuracy of the analysis. A binding behavior was displayed with
  KD = 8.541 × 10−4 M. RU represents response unit.
