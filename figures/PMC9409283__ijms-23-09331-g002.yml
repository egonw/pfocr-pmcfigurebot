caption: 'Analysis of the arginine and proline metabolic pathway: The changes in the
  annotated expression levels of DEGs and differential metabolites in the arginine
  and proline metabolic pathway, and the regulatory relationship between DEGs and
  differential metabolites in the 200 mM NaCl 48 h vs. 200 mM NaCl + 10 mM KCl 48
  h and 200 mM NaCl 168 h vs. 200 mM NaCl + 10 mM KCl 168 h comparison groups. Noteâ€”Black:
  gene expression level is downregulated, metabolites are degraded; red: gene expression
  level is upregulated, metabolites are accumulated.'
