caption: 'CD16- and CD86-positive macrophages are increased in intestinal tissue from
  B3 CD patients. LPMCs obtained from surgical resections were stained with CD45,
  CD14 and CD64 antibodies and identified by flow cytometry: (a) Lamina propria macrophages
  were identified as single live CD45+ CD14+ CD64+ cells (); representative contour
  plots show macrophages in LPMCs cells from the intestine and the graph shows quantification
  of these cells (n ≥ 7 per experimental group); (b) Representative contour plots
  and histograms showing CD16- and CD86- positive cells in CD45+ CD14+ CD64+ lineage,
  graph represents the percentage of CD206-, CD16- and CD86-positive cells within
  total macrophages in intestinal tissue and the mRNA expression of these markers
  in intestinal tissue (n ≥ 7 per experimental group); (c) Human MDMs cells were differentiated
  into macrophages in the presence of secretomes from non-IBD or B2/B3 ileal tissue.
  The expression of CD16, CD86 and CD206 was analysed by RT-PCR (n = 4 per experimental
  group). In all cases, the bars in the graphs represent mean ± SEM. Significant differences
  vs. the non-IBD group are shown by * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 or *** p < 0.001 and
  vs. the B2 samples by # p < 0.05 or ## p < 0.01.'
