caption: CuI arrested the PDAC cell cycle in the G2/M phase and induced apoptosis.
  (A) FACS analysis of PDAC cell cycle progression after CuI treatment. (B) The cell
  cycle distribution was calculated with Cell Quest Pro software. The cell cycle stagnates
  in the G2/M phase with the CuI dose. (C) Cell apoptosis was assessed with Annexin
  V-PI staining. (D) The group treated with 0.5 ÂµM CuI showed the highest rate of
  apoptotic cells. (E) A decrease of Cyclin D1 and Cyclin A2 protein levels while
  increase of Cyclin B1 in CuI-treated PDAC cells. (F) A decrease of Caspase 3 and
  PARP1 protein levels while increase of cleaved Caspase 3 and cleaved PARP1 in CuI-treated
  PC cells.
