caption: Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. (A) PPI network for all
  the significantly changed proteins in proteome analysis. The color of each node
  is assigned according to the log2 transformed fold change of the protein abundances
  of hypoxia to normoxia-treated samples. (B–D) PPI network for upregulated proteins
  enriched in carbon metabolism (B), response to oxygen levels (C), regulation of
  TGF-β receptor signaling pathway (D).
