caption: p53 plays a critical role in TXN1 mediated effects. A EML cells were transduced
  with Cas9 control, TXN1 specific CRISPR/Cas9, p53 specific CRISPR/cas9 or both.
  p53 and P53 downstream signaling pathway were assessed by immunoblot. β-actin was
  used to assess equal loading. B Cells proliferation rate was assessed using BrdU
  proliferation assay. C JC-I mitochondrial membrane depolarization was measured D
  ROS measurement by carboxy-H2DCFDA staining. EML/TXN1KO cells were treated with
  250uM NAC and ROS levels were measured. E Cell proliferation. EML/TXN1KO cells were
  treated with 250uM NAC and cells proliferation rate was assessed using BrdU proliferation
  assay as described. F In vitro cultured colony forming unit in EML control cells, EML
  Cas9 control cells, EML TXN1 KO cells and EML TXN1 KO/NAC cells. EML/TXN1KO cells
  were treated with 250uM NAC, and plated at 2X104/dish in Meth3434 semi-solid medium
  and incubated for 10-12 days. G JC-1 mitochondrial membrane depolarization was not
  affected by NAC treatment. EML/TXN1KO cells were treated with 250uM NAC and JC-1
  levels were measured. (n = 4 Mean ± SEM or SD)
