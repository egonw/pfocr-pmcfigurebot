caption: PREPL modulates important hallmarks of AD in N2A APP cells. (A) ELISA measuring
  extracellular levels of Aβ42 peptides. Each dot represents a counted cell. Welch’s
  t test; ****P < 0.0001. (B, D, and F) Quantitation of Tau phosphorylation measured
  by high-throughput microscopy analysis using antibodies against specific phosphorylated
  Tau residues. Cell Profiler was used to quantitate the fluorescence intensity. The
  levels of phosphorylation were normalized by dividing the fluorescence intensity
  measurements for each cell with the mean fluorescence intensity of total Tau. Each
  dot represents a counted cell; cell numbers are shown in the graph. Welch’s t test;
  ****P < 0.0001. (C, E, and G) A representative blot (original in Supplemental Fig.
  7) for Tau, phospho TauS491 (pTau S491), and phospho TauS698 (pTau S698) is shown
  (middle panels). (Right panels) Quantification showing that two different shPREPL
  constructs (shPREPL A and shPREPL D) cause a decrease in Tau and pTau S491 and an
  increase in pTau S698 protein levels; PREPL expression in knockdown cells rescues
  wild-type phenotype. One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test; **P <
  0.01, ***P < 0.001, ns = not significant.
