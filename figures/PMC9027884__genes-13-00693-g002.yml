caption: 'High-GNG4 group exhibits the high expression of immune-related molecules.
  (A). Differential expression of 122 immunomodulators (chemokines, receptors, MHC,
  and immunostimulators) between high-GNG4 and low-GNG4 groups in BLCA. (B). Correlation
  of GNG4 with 20 inhibitory immune checkpoints. The color indicates the Spearman
  correlation coefficient. (C). Volcano map shows differentially expressed genes between
  high-GNG4 and low-GNG4 groups in BLCA (high: logFC > 1 and log p-value > 2; low:
  logFC < −1 and log p-value > 2). (D). Functional comments and pathway enrichment
  of the genes with GNG4 co-expression genes. (E,F). Estimation of the abundance of
  various types of immune cells between the high-GNG4 and low-GNG4 groups using TIMER_counter
  and MCP_counter algorithm. *, p-value ≤ 0.05; *** p-value ≤ 0.001; ****, p-value
  ≤ 0.0001; ns, p-value > 0.05.'
