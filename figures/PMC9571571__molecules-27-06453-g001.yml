caption: A detailed workflow of our proposal. There are four phases in the workflow.
  The user first enters a disease or a primary pathway to be investigated. The search
  step is done to select relevant PubMed articles. Then each accepted article is sorted
  and parsed. The first network converts each sentence in each PDF to a single embedding
  matrix. The second neural network sorts each sentence in each PDF based on its relevance
  to the query. The third neural network extracts drug names from each relevant sentence.
