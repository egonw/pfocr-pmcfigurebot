caption: 'Effects of JDNW on the expression and translocation of HMGB1 in ACLF rats.
  (a) Immunofluorescence staining of HMGB1 at different time points. Scale bar: 100 μm;
  HMGB1 in the cytoplasm (red arrows). (b) Western blot detection of HMGB1. (c) Ratio
  of HMGB1 in the cytoplasm and (d) total HMGB1 by western blot assay. (e) HMGB1 mRNA
  expression was detected by qRT-PCR. Each bar represents the mean ± SD of n = 3 (∗p
  < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, “ns” p > 0.05).'
