caption: TRIF-dependent pathway not involved in LPS-induced pro-fibrotic cytokine
  signaling in bronchial fibroblasts. NHBF and DHBF were serum-starved for 24 h, and
  thereafter, pre-treated with IRAK 1/4 Inhibitor I (50 µM) for 1 h prior to LPS (10
  µg/mL) stimulation for 2 h for mRNA analysis. The effect of LPS treatment and IRAK1/4
  inhibition on the mRNA expression of TBK1, IRF3, IRF7 and IFN-β in NHBF and DHBF
  was analyzed by qRT-PCR and expressed as fold expression change relative to the
  respective untreated control post normalization to housekeeping gene 18s rRNA. Data
  presented as mean ± SEM after normalization to untreated control. * p < 0.05, **
  p < 0.01, statistical significance assessed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple
  comparison tests.
