caption: (A). Schematic illustration of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. The activation
  of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),
  which in turn phosphorylated PIP2 to PIP3 (). While phosphatase and tensin homolog
  (PTEN) can dephosphorylate PIP3 (). Then Akt is recruited to the plasma membrane
  and phosphorylated by mTORC2 (, ). Akt regulates several cellular processes through
  a variety of downstream proteins like glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK-3β),
  Forkhead Box O (FOXO) etc. () Besides, AKT can phosphorylate and inactivate RAS
  homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) and retention of the Rheb-GTP activates mTORC1
  (). Mechanical force shows association with Akt expression, but further investigation
  is needed to demonstrate the correlation (). (Created with BioRender.com). (B) (a)
  Treatment with LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor) markedly reduces the motility of human
  keratinocytes (). (b) Expression of the differentiatuin marker involucrin increases
  in solvent-treated Myr-p110α*-mER cells (). The 40OHT-treated Myr-p110α*-mER cells
  failed to induce involucrin protein expression under these conditions (). (C) (a)
  Cell Counting Kit-8 analysis revealed that cell proliferation was inhibited by CUDC-907
  at different concentrations, with significant differences among treatment groups
  (). (b) Semi-quantitative analysis of the scratch assay results (n=20) (). (c) CUDC-907
  treatment decreased the production of COL1 and COL3 at 72 h post-treatment, as demonstrated
  by western blot analysis () (*p<0.05, **p<0.01 and ***p<0.001). (D) Hematoxylin
  and eosin, and immunohistochemical staining revealed fewer cell numbers, decreased
  deposition of COL1 and COL3, and fewer formed microvessels (n=15) (). Magnification,
  ×200; scale bar=250 μm. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation of the
  mean. COL1, type I collagen; COL3, type III collagen; CD31, platelet endothelial
  cell adhesion molecule; CD34, hematopoietic progenitor cell antigen CD34 (). NS,
  no significance.
