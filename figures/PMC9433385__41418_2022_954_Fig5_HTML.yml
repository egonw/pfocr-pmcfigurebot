figure_title: Decreased self-renewal and budding efficiency in CUL4B-deficient organoids
  are rescued by Wnt3
caption: a Illustration of supernatant treating assay. The same number of wildtype
  SI organoids treated with supernatant collected from WT or KOIEC organoids with
  the same cell number for 24 or 48 h. b, c The representative images (b) and cell
  numbers (c) of wild type small intestine organoids treated with supernatant collected
  from WT or KOIEC organoids with the same cell number cultured for 24 or 48 h. The
  scale bar is 1000 μm (Left), 400 μm (Right). *P < 0.05. d The mRNA level of stem
  cell markers and Wnt target genes in wildtype SI organoids treated with supernatant
  collected from WT or KOIEC organoids. The experiment was performed with four replicates.
  **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001, ns, no significance. e The relative luciferase activity
  of Wnt reporter cells were detected after treatment with supernatant collected from
  KOIEC and KOLgr5 and WT organoids for 48 h. The same cell number of organoids at
  the third passage were cultured and seeded. *P < 0.01, ns, no significance. f The
  representative images of SI organoids from WT and KOIEC mice with or without treatment
  with recombinant Wnt3a (100 ng/ml). The scale bar is 50 μm. g, h The relative mRNA
  levels of Wnt/β-catenin target genes and protein level of Wnt pathway in WT and
  KOIEC SI organoids with or without treatment with recombinant Wnt3a (100 ng/ml).
  ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. Error bars represent standard errors in the figure.
