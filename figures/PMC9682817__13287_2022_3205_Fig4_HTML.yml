caption: Wnt signaling pathway regulations in tri-lineage differentiation. The Wnt
  signaling pathway regulate the tri-lineage differentiation of C3H10T1/2 through
  canonical or non-canonical signaling pathway. Specific miRNAs have been confirmed
  to regulate the activation or inhibition of Wnt signaling pathway, which further
  acts on the downstream signal molecules, and then guide the commitments of osteogenic,
  adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation of C3H10T1/2. “ → ”represents the upstream
  signal promoting the downstream signal, and “⊥”represents the downstream signal
  inhibiting the downstream signal. The red arrows refer to the promoting effects,
  while the green arrows and lines refer to suppressing effects
