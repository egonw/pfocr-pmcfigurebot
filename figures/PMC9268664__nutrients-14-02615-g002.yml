caption: 'Schematic representation of the mechanism of action of beetroot in the increase
  of vascular function in older subjects. Endothelial cells produce vasodilating substances
  through different enzymes in response to physiological stimuli. Aging can be associated
  with high levels of oxidative stress and inflammation that cause an impairment of
  those vasodilating substances. Dietary NO3− from nitrates rich vegetables, such
  as beetroot, can acutely contribute to replenish the pool of NO in case of impairment
  thanks to NOS independent pathway, such as XOR and Deoxy-Hb of red blood cells.
  Other beet bioactives (e.g., betanin, the main betalains contained in beetroot)
  can also be involved in these processes, through synergistic or independent effects.
  Legend: COX, cyclooxygenase Deoxy-Hb, deoxyhemoglobin; EDHFs, endothelial derived
  hyperpolarizing factors; EET, epoxyeicosatrienoic acid; H2O2, hydrogen peroxide;
  NO2−, nitrites; NO3−, nitrate; NO, nitric oxide; NOS, nitric oxide synthase; PGI2,
  prostacyclin2; XOR, xanthine oxidoreductase.'
