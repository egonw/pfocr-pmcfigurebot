caption: Genetic regulatory network controlling the germline stem cell fate versus
  meiotic development decision. (A) Illustration shows the relative positions of the
  distal tip cell (DTC), cells in the progenitor zone, and cells in early meiotic
  prophase I. (B) Diagrammatic representation of key regulatory factors for the germline
  stem cell fate versus meiotic entry decision in the C. elegans germ line. Ligand
  is expressed in the DTC, and GLP-1/Notch receptor is expressed in the germ line.
  GLP-1/Notch signaling from the DTC niche to germ cells upregulates transcription
  of the stem cell regulators, lst-1 and sygl-1, whose protein products interact with
  components of the PUF hub (FBF-1, FBF-2, PUF-3, PUF-11). LST-1/PUF and SYGL-1/PUF
  complexes are thought to act, at least in part, in translational repression of gld-1
  and gld-2 mRNA (, ). As germ cells move proximally, exiting the niche, concentrations
  of SYGL-1 and LST-1 self-renewal factors decrease, and the meiotic entry pathways
  become active. We note that PUF-8 is not included in the illustration because its
  position relative to the pathway is not known.
