caption: 'Linc00662 promoted the malignant progression by regulating ITGA1 transcription
  in PC. A. ITGA1 was knocked down in PC cells using siRNAs and qPCR was used to examine
  the inhibitory efficacy. The result indicated that ITGA1 si-1 showed the highest
  inhibitory efficacy. B. Western blotting revealed that the overexpression of Linc00662
  Wt increased the expression of ITGA1, which could be reversed by the knockdown of
  ITGA1 using siITGA1. C. The cell adhesion assay revealed that the overexpression
  of Linc00662 in PC cells enhanced the ability of cells to adhere to collagen. Representative
  micrographs were displayed and the bar charts showed the differences of cell numbers
  adhere to collagen among Linc00662 Wt, siITGA1, and control cells. *: P < 0.05,
  magnification: 100 ×. D. The CCK8 assay showed that the cell proliferative capacity
  was significantly increased in Linc00662 Wt cells, which could be reversed by the
  knockdown of ITGA1 using siITGA1. E. The wound healing assay indicated that the
  overexpression of Linc00662 Wt significantly increased cell migratory capacity,
  which could be reversed by the knockdown of ITGA1 using siITGA1. Representative
  micrographs were displayed and the bar charts showed the differences of migratory
  area among Linc00662 Wt, siITGA1, and control cells. *: P < 0.05, magnification:
  100 ×. F. The transwell assay revealed that the overexpression of Linc00662 Wt significantly
  increased cell invasive capacity, which could be reversed by the knockdown of ITGA1
  using siITGA1. Representative micrographs were displayed and the bar charts showed
  the differences of invaded cell numbers among Linc00662 Wt, siITGA1, and control
  cells. *: P < 0.05, magnification: 100 ×. G. Western blotting showed that the overexpression
  of Linc00662 Wt dramatically upregulated the levels of p-FAK, p-Paxillin and p-Erk,
  which could be reversed by the knockdown of ITGA1. H. The immunofluorescence assay
  revealed that the overexpression of Linc00662 Wt caused morphology change with more
  obvious pseudopods, and more FAK and Paxillin localized on the leading edge of the
  plasma membrane, which could be reversed by the knockdown of ITGA1. White arrows
  indicated the location of focal adhesion markers (FAK and Paxillin). Scale bar:
  30 µm. Abbreviations: PC: pancreatic cancer, NC: negative control, Wt: wide type,
