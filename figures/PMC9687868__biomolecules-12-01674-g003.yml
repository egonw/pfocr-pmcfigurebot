caption: OGN signaling in tumorigenesis. (1) ER stress increases OGN expression and
  subsequent tumor cell death. (2) circ_0087429 can reverse EMT and inhibit the progression
  of cervical cancer via miR-5003-3p-dependent upregulation of OGN expression. (3)
  In colorectal cancer, OGN enhances T lymphocyte infiltration by inhibiting the activation
  of HIF-1Î± and significantly inhibiting the expression of VEGF. (4) OGN inhibits
  cell proliferation and invasiveness in breast cancer via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
  pathway. (5) OGN promotes meningioma development through downregulation of NF2 and
  activation of mTOR signaling. (6) OGN reverses EMT and invasiveness in colorectal
  cancer via the EGFR/Akt/zeb1 pathway.
