caption: 'Entinostat and NHS-IL12 combination elicits potent CD8 T and NK cell-dependent
  antitumor efficacy in αPD-L1‒resistant tumor models harboring APM deficiencies.
  (A) Cell surface expression of MHC-I haplotypes and PD-L1 on untreated cells were
  compared with isotype controls or IFN-γ treated cells for TC-1, TC-1/a9, CMT.64,
  and RVP3 cell lines. (B) Oncoplot of gene mutations in the IFN-γ response pathway
  for TC1a9, CMT.64, and RVP3 cell lines; top bar plot shows tumor mutation burden
  per cell line. (C–E) Graphs show tumor growth for (C) TC-1/a9, (D) CMT.64, and (E)
  RVP3 tumor-bearing mice treated with PBS or αPD-L1 as per respective schematic insets
  (blue squares denote αPD-L1 dosing), n=4–5 mice/group. (F–H) Treatment schedule
  and tumor growth curves of (F) TC-1/a9, (G) CMT.64, and (H) RVP3 tumor-bearing C57Bl/6
  mice treated with PBS or entinostat+NHS-IL12, n=4–5 mice/group. (I) Treatment schedule
  and tumor growth curves of TC-1/a9 tumor-bearing mice treated with PBS, entinostat,
  and/or NHS-IL12 as per schematic, n=8–9 mice/group. (J) Frequency of tumor non-immune
  (CD45neg) cells expressing H-2Db and H-2Kb on day 21 post-tumor implant (7 days
  after last dose of NHS-IL12) as in , n=6 mice/group. (K) Treatment schedule and
  tumor growth curves for TC-1/a9 tumor-bearing nu/nu mice treated with PBS, entinostat,
  and/or NHS-IL12 as per schematic, n=9–10 mice/group. (L) Treatment schedule, tumor
  mean and individual tumor growth curves, and survival for TC-1/a9 tumor-bearing
  mice treated with PBS or entinostat+NHS-IL12 as per schematic with CD8 or NK cell
  (asialo GM1) depletion, n=4–9 mice/group; ns=not significant. Insets denote number
  of cured mice/treatment group, and mOS in days (d). All graphs show mean±SEM; data
  are representative of 1 (B, D–E, J–L), 2 (A, I), 3 (C, G–H) or 4 (F) independent
  experiments yielding similar results. Tumor volumes: two-way ANOVA; Survival: Mantel-Cox;
  Bar graphs: one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test; *p<0.05, **p<0.01,
  ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001. In vivo schemas were created with BioRender.com. αPD-L1,
  anti-programmed death ligand 1; ANOVA, analysis of variance; APM, antigen processing
  machinery; IFN-γ, interferon gamma; MHC-I, major histocompatibility complex class
  I; mOS, median overall survival; NK, natural killer; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.'
