figure_title: The MYD88 pathway regulates CREB, CBP, and STAT3 protein stability in
  the osteocyte-enriched cell population
caption: 'a Western blotting of CREB, CBP, and STAT3 proteins in Ocy isolated from
  wild-type (Myd88+l+) male mice. Ocy was treated with T6167923 or vehicle (DMSO)
  every 24 h. Graphs show the intensities of the protein bands relative to those of
  DMSO-treated Ocy at 0 h (%). Graphs were created from the data of three independent
  experiments (n = 3). Normalized by β -Actin. b qPCR analysis of Creb1, Cbp, and
  Stat3 in male Myd88+l+ Ocy treated with or without T6167923 (20 µM) for 48 h. T6167923
  was added to the cultures every 24 h. Representative data from three independent
  experiments with similar results, each with three replicates (n = 3). c Western
  blotting of the indicated proteins in Ocy isolated from Dmp1-Cre;Myd88fl/fl and
  Myd88fl/fl male mice. Graphs show the intensities of the protein bands from Dmp1-Cre;Myd88fl/fl
  mice relative to those from Myd88fl/fl mice normalized by β-Actin (%). Graphs were
  created from the data of three independent experiments (n = 3). d qPCR analysis
  of Creb1, Cbp, and Stat3 in Ocy isolated from Dmp1-Cre;Myd88fl/fl and Myd88fl/fl
  male mice. Representative data from three independent experiments, each with three
  replicates (n = 3). e,f Western blotting of CREB, CBP, and STAT3 in Ocy isolated
  from Myd88+l+ male mice. Ocy was treated with a proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (1 μM)
  or a lysosomal inhibitor leupeptin (100 μM) for 3 h before treatment with T6167923
  (20 μM) for 48 h. MG132, leupeptin, and T6167923 were added to the cultures every
  24 h. a, b, c, d Data are presented as mean ± SD. #p < 0.05 with two-tailed unpaired
  t-test. ns = not significant. a, c, e, f Representative images from more than three
  independent experiments. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.'
