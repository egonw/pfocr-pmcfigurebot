caption: 'SC-derived exosomes rich in miR-21 accelerated the neurite outgrowth of
  NG108-15 cells under high glucose conditions(A) Expression of AKT1, DNMT3A, and
  GAP43 in NG108-15 was detected by PCR, and AKT signaling pathway and neurite outgrowth-related
  factors (DNMT3A, GAP43) were enhanced in NG108-15 cells treated with miR-21-EXO
  compared to MC-EXO (n = 10 samples, t-test: ∗∗∗p < 0.001 versus the MC-EXO group).(B
  and C) Western blot (B) was used to detect the protein expression of p-AKT, t-AKT,
  DNMT3A, and GAP43 in NG108-15 cells, the results had the same trend as the PCR results.
  (C) Gray value statistics of Western blot (n = 6 samples, nonparametric tests: ∗p < 0.05
  of p-AKT/AKT/GAP43/GAPDH, ∗∗p < 0.01 of DNMT3A/GAPDH versus the MC-EXO group).(D
  and E) Immunocytochemistry staining (D) of beta III Tubulin (red) to observe neurite
  outgrowth. Scale bar: 25 μm. (E) Neurite length quantification (n = 10 fields of
  view per group, t-test: ∗∗∗p < 0.001 versus the MC-EXO group). For the above, data
  are represented as mean ± SD.'
