caption: 'Minocycline activated the Notch1 signaling in CD4+ T cells after ICH. (a)
  Representative immunostaining images of CD4 and Notch1 in different groups. (b)
  CD4+ T cells were cultured in vitro with PBS, minocycline, hemoglobin + PBS, and
  hemoglobin + Mino to check the protein levels of Notch1 signal. (c) Quantification
  of protein levels of Notch1 signal in different groups.  ∗ ∗ ∗P < 0.001,  ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗P
  < 0.0001 vs. the T cell + OPCs group; ####P < 0.0001 vs. the T cell+ OPCs+ hemoglobin
  group.'
