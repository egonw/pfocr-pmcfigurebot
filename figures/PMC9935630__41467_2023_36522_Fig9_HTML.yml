figure_title: GSDMD inhibition alleviates disease activity in MRL/lpr mice
caption: a Images of spleen from MRL/lpr mice or MRL/lpr with DSF treatment. Scale
  bar, 1 cm. b Quantitative analysis of spleen weight. c Images of lymph gland from
  MRL/lpr mice or MRL/lpr with DSF treatment. Scale bar, 1 cm. d Quantitative analysis
  of the weight of lymph gland (4 lymph glands). ELISA analysis of the levels of anti-dsDNA
  (e), anti-RNPs (f), anti-Sm (g), IL-1β (h) and IL-18 (i) in serum samples from the
  indicated groups. j qPCR analysis of D-loop in serum from indicated groups. k H&E
  staining of kidney section from indicated groups; scale bar = 100 μm. l Quantitative
  analysis of numbers of glomerular crescents from indicated groups. m ELISA of urine
  albumin-to-creatine ratio in MRL/mpj, MRL/lpr, and MRL/lpr mice treated with DSF.
  n Renal section from the indicated treatment groups were stained with or IgG (green)
  and C3 (red). Scale bar, 50 μm. o, p Quantitative analysis of the intensity of IgG
  and C3 per FOV. q Working model. ICs and IFN-γ in the serum of SLE patients promote
  the activation of GSDMD through serpinb1/caspase-1/11 pathway. Moreover, ICs also
  promote mitochondrial stress, which facilitates the release of Ox-mtDNA into the
  cytosol. Cytosolic Ox-mtDNA directly binds with GSDMD-N to promote GSDMD-N oligomerization
  and GSDMD pore formation. The subsequent extracellular NETs and mtDNA promote SLE
  pathogenesis. n = 6 mice, 2 independent experiments (b, d–j, l, m, o, p). Data are
  shown as means ± SD. Significance was examined with unpaired two-sided Student’s
  t test (b, d) one-way ANOVA (e–j, l, m, o, p).
