figure_title: Evaluation of the bone formation in heterotopic and orthotopic sites
  induced by the PEKK scaffold
caption: (A) Timeline and arrangement of the in vivo experiments. (B) Implantation
  site of the scaffold and the μ-CT evaluation of new bone (white) formation within
  the scaffold. (C) Histological analysis for new bone formation within the scaffold
  (M, material; B, bone tissue). EDS, energy-dispersive spectrometry. (D) Bone induction
  incidence of the scaffold. (E) Quantitative analysis of the volume and (F) area
  fraction of new bone formation within the scaffold. (G) Hematoxylin and eosin staining
  of histological sections and quantitative analysis of the area fraction of new bone
  formation within different PEKK scaffolds at week 12 postoperatively (M, material;
  B, bone tissue). (H) μ-CT evaluation and quantitative analysis of the volume fraction
  of new bone formation (gray) within different PEKK scaffolds at week 12 postoperatively
  (error bars, means ± SD; n = 10 per group; all analyses were done using unpaired
  Student’s t test). ***P < 0.001.
