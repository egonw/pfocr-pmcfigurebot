caption: Overexpression of miR-195-5p inhibits the proliferation and migration of
  GBC Cells. (A) qRT-PCR analyses of miR-195-5p levels were performed after treatment
  of GBC-SD and NOZ cells with miR-195-5p mimics and inhibitor or NC. (B) CCK-8 assays
  were used to examine cell viability of GBC-SD and NOZ cells after transfection with
  miR-195-5p mimics and inhibitor or NC. (C,D) Wound healing assays were shown in
  GBC-SD and NOZ cells after transfection with miR-195-5p mimics and inhibitor or
  NC. Cell migration was observed using a microscope (original magnification, ×100).
  (E,F) Transwell assays were used to detect cell invasion capacities of GBC-SD and
  NOZ cells after transfection with miR-195-5p mimics and inhibitor or NC (dyeing
  with crystal violet; original magnification, ×200). (G,H) Flow cytometry was used
  to assess the cell cycle distribution of GBC-SD and NOZ cells transfected with miR-195-5p
  mimics and inhibitor or the control cells for 24 h and stained with PI. Data are
  mean ± SD. *P<0.05 compared with control group. The experiment was repeated 3 times.
  GBC, gallbladder cancer; qRT-PCR, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction;
  NC, negative control; CCK-8, Cell Counting Kit-8; PI, propidium iodide; SD, standard
  deviation.
