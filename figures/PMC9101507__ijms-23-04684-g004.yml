caption: Pathways of signaling, trafficking and autophagy in squamous cyst cells (SCCs)
  of the Drosophila testis. (A) PAR components suppress JNK signaling in SCCs. In
  normal (wild type) SCCs, the PAR complex reduces JNK pathway activation (left SCC
  shown in green). In PAR loss of function (l.o.f.) SCCs (right SCC shown in red),
  de-repression of JNK signaling leads to spermatocyte death. JNK may act (1) by cooperating
  with Rab35 to deliver the death signal to the germline or (2) independently (but
  in parallel to Rab35) to induce spermatocyte phagocytosis by the SCCs. (diagram
  adapted with modifications from Ref. []). (B) EGFR stimulates autophagy to control
  lipid levels and CySC maintenance. In CySCs, binding of the EGF ligand Spitz to
  the EGFR activates the MAPK signaling cascade and stimulates autophagy. Autophagy
  prevents the accumulation of lipids, which would otherwise compromise GSC homeostasis
  and survival. Lipophagy and mitochondrial quality control (through fatty acid oxidation)
  further reduce lipid accumulation. In early-stage SCCs, TOR via the ILR-PI3K-TOR
  pathway, suppresses autophagy temporarily and allows SCC differentiation to proceed
  (diagram adapted with modifications from Refs. [,]). To simplify the diagrams, two
  different cyst cells are depicted in (A,B) as part of the same cyst cell-germline
  cyst.
