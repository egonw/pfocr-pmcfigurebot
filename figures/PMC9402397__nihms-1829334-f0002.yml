figure_title: Activation of tumor oncogenic pro-growth and survival pathways alters
  tumor cell susceptibility to T cell CYT
caption: (A) Systematic screening of tumor signaling pathways for potential to alter
  tumor vulnerability to T cell CYT was performed by transducing A375 melanoma cells
  with lentiviral cDNA open reading frames (ORFs) encoding proteins driving constitutive
  activity across pro-growth and survival signaling pathways. Transduced cells were
  co-cultured with NY-ESO-1 TCR-engineered T cells in an arrayed format, and cytotoxic
  T cell (CTL) killing of tumor cells was measured.(B) The impact of each alteration
  on tumor death after co-culture was determined. Modifications to tumor cells disfavoring
  T cell killing are shown in red and pink (red depicts modifications found to be
  statistically significant across 2 independent screens; pink indicates modifications
  driving statistically significant resistance to killing in 1 screen), and modifications
  increasing tumor cell killing by T cells are indicated in green. Statistical analysis
  was performed by 2-tailed Studentâ€™s t test, with comparison made to luciferase control.
  Significant hits were called with p < 0.05. Error bars depict standard deviation.(C)
  Results of biological replicate screens are depicted.(D) Mel624 melanoma cells were
  transduced with selected pathway activating constructs and susceptibility to MART-1
  TCR-engineered T cells was measured. Error bars depict standard deviation.
