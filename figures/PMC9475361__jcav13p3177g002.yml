caption: The expression and clinical significance of LINC00674 in HCC. (A) The expression
  of LINC00674 in HCC cell lines (Hep3B and MHCC97H) and normal hepatic cell line
  L02 were explored by RT-qPCR analysis. (B) The levels of LINC00674 in 75 paired
  HCC and adjacent non-tumor (NT) tissues were explored by RT-qPCR analysis. (C) The
  GEPIA web server was applied to analyze the expression of LINC00674 in HCC (n=369)
  and normal tissues (n=50). (D) Kaplan-Meier curves were established to explore the
  predicting value of LINC00674 expression in overall survival rate of HCC patients.
  (E) The GEPIA web server was applied to analyze the prognostic value of LINC00674
  expression in HCC. *P<0.05.
