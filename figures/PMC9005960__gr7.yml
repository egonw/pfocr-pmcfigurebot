caption: 'Inactivation of Piezo1 stimulates expression of Nox4 via the Ca2+-PKC signaling
  axis. (A) GSEA for “PKC signaling pathway” based on RNAseq of Piezo1f/f and Piezo1scKO
  MuSC. (B) PKC activity in Ad-Cre or Ad-null virus infected Piezo1f/f MuSCs (t-test:
  **p < 0.01, n = 4 independent experiments, 8 replicates for each experiment). (C)
  PKC activity in Ad-Cre or Ad-null virus infected Piezo1f/f MuSCs after treatment
  with 5 μM ML218 for 48h (One-way ANOVA-test: **p < 0.01; ns, p > 0.05, n = 4 independent
  experiments, 8 replicates per experiment). (D) RT-qPCR analysis of Nox1, Nox2, Nox3,
  and Nox4 expression in Piezo1f/f and Piezo1scKO MuSCs. mRNA levels were normalized
  to Gapdh SEM (t-test: **p < 0.01; ns, p > 0.05, n = 3, 2-months-old male mice).
  (E) Western blot analysis of NOX4 in Ad-Cre or Ad-null virus infected Piezo1f/f
  MuSCs. (F) Western blot analysis of NOX4 in Ad-Cre or Ad-null virus infected Piezo1f/f
  MuSCs after treatment with 5 μM ML218 for 48h. (G) Western blot analysis of NOX4
  in Ad-Cre or Ad-null virus infected Piezo1f/f MuSCs after treatment with 10 nM pan-PKC
  inhibitor (Go 6983) for 48h. (H) Intracellular ROS concentration in Ad-Cre or Ad-null
  virus infected Piezo1f/f MuSCs after treatment with 10 nM pan-PKC inhibitor (Go
  6983) for 48h (One-way ANOVA-test: **p < 0.01; ns, p > 0.05, n = 3 independent experiments,
  6 replicates for each experiment). (I) Intracellular ROS concentration in Ad-Cre
  or Ad-null virus infected Piezo1f/f MuSCs after treatment with 5 μM GLX351322 for
  48h (One-way ANOVA-test: **p < 0.01; ns, p > 0.05, n = 3 independent experiments,
  6 replicates for each experiment). (J) Western blot analysis of P53 in Ad-Cre or
  Ad-null virus infected Piezo1f/f MuSCs after treatment with 5 μM GLX351322 for 48h.
  (K) SA-β-gal staining of Ad-Cre or Ad-null virus infected Piezo1f/f MuSCs after
  48h treatment with GLX351322 or DMSO. (L) Quantifications of SA-β-gal+ MuSCs of
  Ad-Cre or Ad-null virus infected Piezo1f/f MuSCs after treatment with 5 μM GLX351322
  for 48h. (One-way ANOVA-test: **p < 0.01; ns, p > 0.05, n = 4 independent experiments,
  10 repeats for each experiment, 30 fields chosen randomly were quantified for each
  repeat).'
