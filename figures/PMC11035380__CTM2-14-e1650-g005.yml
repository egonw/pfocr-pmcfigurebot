caption: RNA‐Seq of mouse spinal cord after spinal cord injury. (a) Volcano plots
  of mouse spinal cord RNA‐sequencing (RNA‐Seq) results showing that Atf3, highlighted
  in purple, is one of the most significantly upregulated genes 4 h after spinal cord
  injury (SCI) (adjusted Benjamini‒Hochberg false discovery rate [BHFDR] p < .05).
  (b) Top 20 in Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEG)
  from RNA‐Seq, showing multiple major pathways including mitogen‐activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) cascade, positive regulation of cell death, and regulation of extrinsic
  apoptotic signalling pathway, and negative regulation of phosphorus metabolic pathway.
article_title: ATF3 is a neuron‐specific biomarker for spinal cord injury and ischaemic
