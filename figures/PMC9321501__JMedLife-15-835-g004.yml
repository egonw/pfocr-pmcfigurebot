caption: We examined the candidate proteins with the GEPIA database and drew a box
  plot, stage plot, and survival diagram for 6 candidate proteins. Overall, high and
  low expression proteins are indicated in stages plots in major stages, and survival
  plots showed that these proteins reduce survival rate by about 80% in 100 months.
