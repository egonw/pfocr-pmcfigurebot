caption: Association between BUFAS and drug sensitivity. (A-F) The correlation between
  BUFAS of cell samples and the estimated IC50 value of medications, including cisplatin
  (A), gemcitabine (B), camptothecin (C), lapatinib (D), BIBW2992 (E), and AP.24534
  (F). (G) The association of IC50 value estimated in 69 medications with the genes
  involved in unsaturated fatty acid production. *P<0.05; **P<0.01; ***P<0.001; and
  ****P<0.0001 by spearman correlation.
