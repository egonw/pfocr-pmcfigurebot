caption: 'Stable terminator bioparts can control metabolic pathways in a reliable
  and scalable manner. (A) Heterologous pathways for acetoin and 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BDO)
  biosynthesis from pyruvate. Abbreviations are as follows: alsS, acetolactate synthase;
  alsD, acetolactate decarboxylase; and bdh, butanediol dehydrogenase. (B) The expression
  of bdh is dependent on the read-through of RITs located upstream. (C) Altered production
  of acetoin and 2,3-BDO in response to the RIT strengths. Titers of extracellular
  metabolites were measured after 24 h batch fermentation. Error bars indicate the
  standard deviations of the two biological replicate cultures. Pie charts indicate
  the relative expression of alsSD and bdh. (D) Metabolic flux valve system controlling
  the glycolytic flux for cellular resources and myo-inositol (MI) production. The
  expression of pfkA involves the metabolic valve of stable terminator bioparts. Abbreviations
  are as follows: zwf, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; pgi, glucose-6-phosphatate
  isomerase; pfkA, 6-phosphofructokinase 1; and INO1, inositol-3-phosphate synthase.
  (E) Design of the flux-valved MI production pathway. The E. coli ΔpfkA Δzwf strain
  was used for maximum production and control efficiency. (F) Glucose consumption,
  MI production, and MI yield from the glucose (g/g) of E. coli harboring one of the
  pMI plasmids. The conv. sys. indicates the E. coli MG1655 wild-type (both pfkA and
  zwf were not perturbed) strain heterologously expressing INO1 without a metabolic
  valve. Error bars indicate the standard deviations of the two biological replicate
  cultures.'
