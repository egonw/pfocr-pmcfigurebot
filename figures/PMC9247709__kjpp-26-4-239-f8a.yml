figure_title: Fig. 8. MiR-21/PARP-1 regulates the EMT of 16HBE cells via activation
  of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway
caption: (A, B) Western blot analysis evaluated the protein expressions of PI3K/AKT-signaling-pathway-related
  molecular proteins in 16HBE cells transfected with NC, miR-21 mimics, or PARP-1
  siRNA after 48 h. The experiments were replicated three times and presented as mean
  ± SD. *p < 0.05 vs. NC + D group, **p < 0.001 vs. NC + D group, †p < 0.05 vs. miR21
  + D or siPARP-1 + D group. (C–F) Effects of LY294002 on the EMT-related proteins
  in 16HBE cells transfected with NC, miR-21 mimics, or PARP-1 siRNA, as detected
  by Western blot and qRT-PCR after 48 h. The experiments were replicated three times
  and presented as mean ± SD. miR-21, microRNA-21; PARP-1, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1;
  EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition; 16HBE, Human bronchial epithelial cell;
  NC, normal control; siRNA, small interfering RNA; siPARP-1, PARP-1 siRNA; D, dimethylsulfoxide;
