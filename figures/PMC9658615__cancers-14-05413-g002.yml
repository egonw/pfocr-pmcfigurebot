caption: Timeline of the patient care pathway with median delays for each diagnostic
  and therapeutic step. As only 481 patients presented symptoms before the diagnosis,
  delay between symptoms and CT scan did not integrate patients with incidental disease.
  From the CT scan, the whole population was considered to determine the timeline
  with median delays. Treatment start excluded patients with exclusive best supportive
  care, as this care usually started without delay if needed. Delays are presented
  as median with IQR.
