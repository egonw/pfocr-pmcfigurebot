figure_title: Proteomic assessment of the functional consequences of ATP6AP2 knockdown
  in the Ishikawa endometrial epithelial cancer cell line
caption: Tandem Mass Tags (TMT) mass spectrometry-based proteomics was used to quantitatively
  assess differences in the protein composition of the Ishikawa cell line following
  siRNA knockdown of ATP6AP2. (A) Pearson multi-scatter plot displaying the correlation
  among the three biological replicates of the transfected (top) and control (bottom)
  samples. (B) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of the overall distribution and (C)
  protein class of each of the proteins identified. Scatter plots were constructed
  using Perseus (version 1.6.10.43) and the distribution and class assessment using
  licensed Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (IPAÂ®, Qiagen) and the Ingenuity Knowledge
  Base. (D) Quantitative expression profiles (heat map) indicated that all transfected
  samples cluster as do the vehicle control samples. In addition, the heat map displays
  the protein identifications with most significant abundance changes.
