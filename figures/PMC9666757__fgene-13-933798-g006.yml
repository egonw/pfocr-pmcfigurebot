caption: Identification and analysis of the CD79B-associated immunomodulators. (A)
  Heatmaps of CD79B-associated immunoinhibitors (left panel) and immunostimulators
  (right panel) in the CESC cohorts. (B) The PPI network concerning the 52 CD79B-associated
  immunomodulators, including immunoinhibitors (blue node) and immunostimulators (red
  node), as visualized by Cytoscape (C and D) GO (C) and KEGG pathway (D) enrichment
  analysis results for 52 immunomodulators from the PPI network based on the CESC
  cohorts that are highly likely to have an interactive relationship.
