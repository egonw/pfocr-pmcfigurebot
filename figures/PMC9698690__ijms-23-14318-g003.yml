caption: Evolutionary analysis of SRO families in different species. (A) The evolutionary
  relationship and number of SRO families in 15 species, S. tuberosum (6), Malus domestica
  (M. domestica, 6), Vitis vinifera (V. vinifera, 5), Zea mays (Z. mays, 6), Setaria
  italic (S. italic, 4), Elaeis guineensis (E. guineensis, 3), Glycine max (G. max,
  5), Populus trichocarpa (P. trichocarpa, 7), O. sativa (O. sativa, 5), A. thaliana
  (6), Brachypodium distachyon (B. distachyon, 5), Medicago Truncatula (M. truncatula,
  7), S. lycopersicum (6), Physcomitrium patens (P. patens, 3), and Phoenix dactylifera
  (P. dactylifera, 3), the color of species represents their taxonomic characteristics,
  and the size and color of sectors represent the number of SRO families in species
  and the groups to which they belong. (B) Using Neighbor Join (NJ) method in MEGA-X
  to construct phylogenetic tree, SROs of different species are divided into two groups
  (Group I and Group II), with different shapes of logos representing different species,
  as detailed in . (C) Phylogenetic tree of the SRO families of Solanaceae, SROs of
  different Solanaceae species are represented by different font colors, the evolutionary
  tree shows the conserved domains of corresponding SROs, among which the WWE domain
  is green, the RST domain is yellow, and the PARP domain is pink, as detailed in
  .
