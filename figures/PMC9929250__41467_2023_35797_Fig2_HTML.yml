figure_title: A summary of proteogenomic analysis of DGC
caption: a Genes with non-silent variants in at least six patients (9%) are depicted
  on the OncoPrint. Bars on the right of the graph show the numbers of non-synonymous
  mutations. b Prognosis outcomes of corresponding gene mutations. n (with ARID1A
  mutant) = 7 and n (without ARID1A mutant) = 58 biologically independent samples.
  The points and error bars show the median of hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence
  interval (CI). c Cis- and trans-effects of significantly mutated genes (y-axis)
  on protein level (x-axis). The p-values are calculated by Fisher’s exact test. The
  related biological functions and pathways are shown at the bottom. d Altered expression
  of ARID1A associated with ARID1A mutations. In proteome, n (mutant) = 7 and n (WT) = 58
  biologically independent samples. In TF activity profile, n (mutant) = 2 and n (WT) = 38
  biologically independent samples. Boxplots show median (central line), upper and
  lower quartiles (box limits), min to max range. The p-values are calculated using
  two-sided student’s t-test. e Pathways enriched by GSEA in ARID1A mutated patients.
  Nominal p-value, calculated as phenotype based permutation test. f TLR signaling
  pathway was significantly enriched in ARID1A mutated patients. g Altered expression
  of proteins enriched in TLR signaling pathway. The p-values are calculated by two-sided
  Wilcoxon rank-sum test. h Altered expression of CD14 associated with ARID1A mutation.
  n (mutant) = 7 and n (WT) = 58 biologically independent samples. Boxplots show median
  (central line), upper and lower quartiles (box limits), min to max range. The p-value
  is calculated using two-sided student’s t-test. i The prognostic outcome of CD14
  in DGC. n (low) = 42 and n (high) = 23 biologically independent samples. The p-value
  is calculated using Log-rank test. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.
