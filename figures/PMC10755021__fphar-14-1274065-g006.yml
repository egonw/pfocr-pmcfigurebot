caption: Fit of different agonist-induced MOPr responses along two different pathways
  involving G-protein activation and β-arrestin2 recruitment. Data from  are shown
  as symbols with G-protein activation in darker and β-arrestin responses in lighter
  colors for DAMGO (blue), morphine (purple), buprenorphine (green), oliceridine (red),
  and its S isomer (S)-TRV130 (brown). Lines indicate the unified fit obtained with
  SABRE using experimentally measured log K d values, two pathway amplifications (γ
  Gprt, γ βArr), and a single efficacy parameter (ε) for each agonist. Due to signal
  amplification in the G protein response pathway (γ Gprt > 1) and apparent attenuation/loss
  in the β-arrestin2 one (γ βArr < 1), weak agonists (ε << 1.0) such as buprenorphine
  (ε = 0.141) and oliceridine (ε = 0.382), produce essentially no β-arrestin response
  even if no bias is assumed (ε Gprt = ε βArr).
