caption: Functional analysis of miRNA- and lncRNA-targeted genes(A) The involvement
  of the miRNA- and lncRNA-targeted genes in various pathways was investigated using
  KEGG pathway analysis. A list of the most enriched KEGG pathways in which the genes
  are involved is shown. (B) Genes associated with various components, metabolic pathways,
  and neurodegeneration pathways. The four common genes, NDUFA9, LIPG, KYNU, and HKDC1,
  are shown. (C) Gene target identification workflow. Schematic of the workflow used
  to analyze the miRNA-specific gene targets with the help of the miRWalk 2.0 web
  server. The lncRNA-targeted mRNAs were identified using LncExpDB.
