caption: Schematic model showing the dual roles of Auranofin in countering SARS-CoV-2
  infection and inflammatory cascadesWe propose a model in which Auranofin acts on
  the diffusion of ACE2, the main receptor of SARS-CoV-2, and lipid microdomains with
  the consequence of a significant effect on endocytosis, which is one of the mechanisms
  of viral entry. Our data show that Auranofin targets early events of the NF-κB signaling
  pathway and inhibits its activation both in response to viral entry and the cytokine
  hyperproduction that correlates with multi-organ systemic complications, eventually
  leading to death.
