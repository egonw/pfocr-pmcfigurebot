caption: 'Effects of storax on cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the myocardium of ISO-induced
  AMI rats. (A) Representative images of terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated
  dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells were shown
  in green and DAPI nuclear staining was shown in blue (scale bar = 50 μm). (B) Quantitative
  analysis of TUNEL-positive cells (n = 4). (C) The protein expression levels of Bax,
  Bcl-2 and cleaved Caspase-3 in rat cardiac tissue of each group were shown by Western
  blotting (WB) bands. (D–F) Relative protein for Bax, Bcl-2 and cleaved Caspase-3
  were quantified by densitometry based on immunoblot images. Results are presented
  as mean ± SD (n = 3). One-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc test: # p
  < 0.05, ## p < 0.01 vs. vehicle group.'
