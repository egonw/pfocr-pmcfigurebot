figure_title: Functional enrichment of DMT vs SHAM DEGs according to fenofibrate-responsiveness
  and tubular epithelial cell localisation
caption: 'A-B: DMT vs SHAM DEGs found to be responsive to one or more FLMRR medications
  were classified according to fenofibrate-responsiveness and predominant localisation
  in either the proximal tubule or the rest of the renal tubule (). Functional enrichment
  analyses (Reactome pathway analysis (A) and gene ontology cellular component testing
  (B)) were performed on medication-responsive DMT vs SHAM DEGs according to this
  classification system, with results presented on dotplots [, ]. Pathways pertaining
  to fatty acid metabolism and cellular components relating to peroxisomal and mitochondrial
  metabolism are bolded. C: Network plot of DMT vs SHAM DEGs which are fenofibrate-responsive
  and abundant in proximal tubular cells. Fatty acid metabolism pathways (bolded in
  panel A) and cellular components (bolded in panel B) enriched by these genes are
  overlaid on the network. Node size of pathways and cellular component terms is scaled
  by the number of genes belonging to those categories. Gene nodes are coloured according
  to log2 fold-change values for the DMT vs SHAM comparison, averaged between the
  ZDF and ZDSD models. Mitochondrial and peroxisomal nodes are identified by green
  and gold edges, respectively. CC, cellular component; DEG, differentially expressed
