caption: Pathway enrichment analysis of the differential metabolites in the OEGA transgenic
  citrus. (A) Classification and proportion of the differentially-accumulated metabolites.
  The numbers next to the pie chart represent the percentage of different types of
  DAMs among the total differential metabolites. (B) Abundance of the significant
  DAMs among the different metabolite classes. Red and green indicate increased and
  decreased levels of metabolites, respectively, as indicated by the colored squares.
  Lysophosphatidylcholine, LysoPC; lysophosphatidylethanolamine, LysoPE. (C) Significantly-enriched
  KEGG metabolic pathways. The abscissa indicates the enrichment factor, and the ordinate
  indicates the enrichment pathway. The dot sizes represent the number of differentially-enriched
  metabolites. The greater the rich factor, the greater the degree of enrichment.
  The larger the point, the greater the number of differentially-enriched metabolites
  in the pathway. The significance of the enrichment level is indicated by the color
  of the dot according to the color scheme shown on the right.
