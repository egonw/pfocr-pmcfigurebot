caption: Histogram of the different gene relationship types found between the genes
  involved in an oligogenic variant combination. The types of gene relationship were
  obtained either directly from the articles or from public databases (for the ‘Relevant
  pathways for phenotype’, ‘Same Pathway’ and ‘Directly Interacting’ relationships).
  Genes are ‘Involved in the same disease’ if patients with the same phenotype described
  or referenced in the manuscript carried mutations in those genes, together or independently.
  Pathway information for each gene was either described in the article or found in
  the KEGG () or Reactome () databases and was then manually screened to check if
  the genes belong to ‘Relevant pathways for the phenotype’ (e.g. glucose metabolism
  pathway for a diabetic phenotype) or in the ‘Same pathway’. Similarly, genes ‘Affecting
  the same tissue’ must also be expressed in the same relevant tissue for the phenotype.
  The ‘Directly interacting’ denotes a PPI, either described in the article or retrieved
  from the comPPI database (). It is distinguished from the ‘Same protein complex’
  relation where the gene products are considered to only fulfil their function when
  linked together (e.g. the subunits of a channel). ‘Indirectly interacting’ genes
  are those whose products indirectly interact with an intermediate protein or are
  involved in a gene regulation mechanism with other gene products (e.g. transcription
  factors). ‘Similar function’ indicates that genes have the same function (e.g. motor
  proteins). ‘Co-localization’ implies a direct overlap of the location of the gene
  products in the cell (e.g. shown using immunofluorescence), while ‘Same organelle’
  implies that the protein products exercise their function in the same organelle
  (e.g. cilia proteins). The ‘Co-expression’ relationship implies a positive correlation
  of the mRNA expression of the genes in a temporal fashion shown or referenced in
  the article. Finally the ‘Monogenic experiments only’ notes the fact that the experimental
  evidence and the assessment of their pathogenicity were done on the genes independently
  (e.g. single knockouts).
