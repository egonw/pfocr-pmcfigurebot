caption: Driver–TIME functional networks in HNSC subtypes. A Reconstruction of HNSC
  driver-TIME functional networks. HNSC transcriptional regulatory network was used
  to identify the transcription factors (TFs) differentially active (DA) in the three
  HNSC subtypes that correlated with TIME features and were associated with TIME drivers.
  Combining functional data, the significant functional networks linking these drivers
  to TIME TFs were derived. B DNMT3B functional subnetwork in HPV+ HNSCs. C Comparison
  of PHF1 protein activity between DNMT3B-damaged and wild-type (wt) HPV+ HNSCs. D
  Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) plot comparing the activation of the keratinization
  pathway between DNMT3B-damaged and wt HPV+ HNSCs. E Comparison of DNMT3B-damaged
  samples between immune (IMU) and keratinization (KRT) HPV+ HNSCs from []. F Comparison
  of FASL gene expression levels between CASP8-damaged and wt HPV− CNAlow HNSCs. G
  Schematic of cytotoxic T-cell induced apoptosis of cancer cells through the FAS-FASL
  cascade. H CASP8 functional subnetwork in HPV− CNAlow HNSCs. I Comparison of IRF7
  protein activity in CASP8-damaged and wt HPV− CNAlow HNSCs. J GSEA plots comparing
  the activation of the α/β interferon signalling and apoptosis regulation pathways
  between CASP8-damaged and wt HPV− CNAlow HNSCs. K GSEA plot comparing the activation
  of the WNT signalling pathway between TERT-damaged and wt HPV− CNAhigh HNSCs. L
  TERT functional subnetwork in HPV− CNAhigh HNSCs. M Comparison of PRMT5 protein
  activity between TERT-damaged and wt HPV− CNAhigh HNSCs. N GSEA plot comparing the
  activation of the interferon signalling pathway between TERT-damaged and wt HPV−
  CNAhigh HNSCs. CNA, copy number alteration; HNSC, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma;
  HPV, human papilloma virus; TIME, tumour immune microenvironment. Distributions
  (C, F, I, M) were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Proportions (E) were compared
  using Fisher’s exact test. GSEAs (D, J, K, N) were performed using gene set permutation
  tests
