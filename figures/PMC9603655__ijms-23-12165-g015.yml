caption: Pathway for enzymatic degradation, bioassimilation and mineralization of
  the natural polymer cellulose and starch. Cellulose and starch are enzymatically
  hydrolyzed by extracellular enzymes, cellulases and α/β amylases, respectively,
  to glucose. The soluble product glucose is converted to pyruvic acid via glycolysis.
  Pyruvate dehydrogenase catalyzes the conversion of pyruvic acid to acetyl-CoA, which
  is later metabolized through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to produce energy
  and release CO2 and water.
