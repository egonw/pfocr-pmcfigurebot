caption: Key steps of hydroxybenzoic acid biosynthetic pathway and expression analysis
  by qRT-PCR of genes involved in their biosynthesis in leaves collected from ‘Ca.
  P. solani’-positive plants, expressed as fold change (FC) relative to ‘Ca. P. solani’-negative
  plants. Samples were collected in May, July, August, and September. The reported
  compounds detected by HPLC ESI/MS-TOF and the key genes and relative biosynthetic
  enzymes are in red. ICS, isochorismate synthase; DMR6, downy mildew-resistant 6.
  Red lines highlight the 2-fold change to graphically identify genes upregulated
  in positive plants compared to negative ones. ANOVA results were reported based
  on their statistical significance. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
