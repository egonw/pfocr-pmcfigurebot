caption: PHF6 physically interacts with HIF-1 and HIF-2 to enhance HIF transactivation.
  A The Gene Ontology (GO) bioinformatic analysis revealing the enriched items in
  breast cancer patients with upregulated PHF6 expression. B The Co-Immunoprecipitation
  (Co-IP) assay showing the endogeous interactions between PHF6 and HIF(HIF-1α, HIF-2α)
  proteins. C Immunoblot assays of indicated proteins in parental, HIF-1α–KO, HIF-2α–KO,
  or HIF-1/2α–DKO MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to 1% O2 for 24 h (N = 3). D MCF-7 cells
  were co-transfected with a HIF-1 luciferase reporter (p2.1), pSV-Renilla, and vector
  encoding WT or FLAG-PHF6 or EV. After exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 24 h, cells were
  subjected to dual-luciferase reporter assays. E The p2.1, pSV-Renilla, and vector
  encoding FLAG-PHF6 or EV plasmids were co-transfected into WT and HIF-DKO MCF-7
  cells. After exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 24 h, cells were subjected to dual-luciferase
  reporter assays. F The qPCR assays detecting the associations between HIF-1α and
  PHF6. G The qPCR assays detecting the associations between HIF-2α and PHF6 in Bca
  cells. H The RT-qPCR analysis detecting the indicated mRNAs in parental or PHF6
  KO MCF-7 cells that were exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 24 h. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001
