figure_title: Identification of the LRG1-LPHN2 signaling pathway
caption: 'a HUVECs were stimulated with LRG1 (1 μg/ml) for the indicated times under
  high-glucose conditions. Immunoprecipitants with an anti-LPHN2 antibody were analyzed
  by Western blotting using antibodies specific for pY-LPHN2 and LPHN2. b Cignal Finder
  GPCR signaling 10-pathway reporter array analysis of HUVECs after treatment with
  LRG1 (1 μg/ml). The results of dual-luciferase assays are presented as normalized
  relative luminescence signals (means ± SEM, n = 3). The relative ratio of the untreated
  group was defined as 1. **P < 0.01 (Student’s t test). c Network model showing interactions
  between the proteins with increased phosphorylation in response to LRG1. Node color
  indicates the increase (red) in the phosphorylation level. The color bar indicates
  the gradient of the log2-fold-change of phosphorylation levels by LRG1 with respect
  to those in untreated control conditions. Circled P on a node indicates phosphorylation
  of the corresponding protein. Arrows, activation; inhibition symbols, inhibition;
  solid arrows, direct activation; dotted arrows, indirect activation; gray lines,
  protein–protein interactions; and green lines, plasma membrane. d Western blot analysis
  of HUVECs stimulated with LRG1 (5 μg/ml) using the indicated antibodies. e Western
  blot analysis of HUVECs stimulated with 1 µg/ml LRG1 with or without pre-treatment
  with PP2 (10 μM) or LY294002 (10 μM). f and g HUVECs (f) and mouse DRG explants
  (g) were treated with LRG1 (1 μg/ml), LY (10 μM), PP2 (10 μM), LRG1 (1 μg/ml) +
  LY (10 μM), or LRG1 (1 μg/ml) + PP2 (10 μM). Top: Representative images of HUVEC
  tube formation (f) and βIII-tubulin staining in mouse DRG explants (g). The relative
  ratio of the untreated group was defined as 1. Scale bars, 100 µm. Bottom: Master
  junctions (n = 4) (f) and βIII-tubulin–immunopositive axon lengths in DRGs (g) were
  quantified using ImageJ, and the results are presented as the means ± SEM (n = 4).
  h Western blot analysis of HUVECs stimulated with 1 µg/ml LRG1 for 30 min or 7 hr
  using antibodies specific for angiogenic factors (VEGFA, angiopoietin-1, FGF2).'
