figure_title: Elimination of Gli1+ cells alone after HH pathway inhibition is not
  sufficient for the induction of ectopic HHIP in fungiform papilla (FP) and expression
  of ectopic HHIP is not directly impeding FP recovery after withdrawing HH pathway
  inhibition
caption: '(A-C) Antibody detection of endogenous HHIP (red) and taste bud (TB) cells
  (K8, green) after 5d whole body Smo deletion. Three categories of FP/TB: Typical
  FP/TB, Atypical FP/TB and Atypical FP/No TB are assessed. Percentage numbers are
  quantification of the three FP/TB types in a half tongue (total FP = 28). (A’-C’)
  X-Gal staining in the same sections demonstrates elimination of Gli1lacZ HH-responding
  cells from FP basal and perigemmal cell regions in all the three FP/TB types. HHIP
  expression in Atypical FP with or without TB (arrows) and not in Typical FP/TB suggests
  a requirement of both SHH and Gli1 reduction for ectopic HHIP expression. Asterisks
  in B denote non-specific staining post X-Gal reactions. Dotted lines outline the
  base of the epithelium. Scale bar in A applies to all images. (D-F) Antibody detection
  of endogenous HHIP (red) and TB cells (K8, green) after Vehicle and 16d sonidegib
  treatment followed by 14 days Recovery (discontinuation of drug). Percentage numbers
  are quantification of Typical FP/TB and Atypical FP/No TB during Recovery from previous
  findings. There is no HHIP expression in Typical FP/TB in Vehicle (D) or after Recovery
  (E). Ectopic HHIP expression is apparent in Atypical FP/No TB even after stopping
  the drug treatment for 14 days (F). (G-I) X-Gal staining in Gli1lacZ reporter mouse
  in Vehicle and Sonidegib treated Recovery group showed usual Gli1lacZ expression,
  in FP basal, perigemmal and stromal cells, in Vehicle (G) and in the recovered Typical
  FP/TB (H). In Atypical FP/No TB, while Gli1lacZ expression is not restored in FP
  epithelium (I) HHIP expression is maintained at the FP apex (F). Thus, if Gli1lacZ+
  cells are resumed during recovery the ectopic HHIP expression is simultaneously
  lost, and when there is no Gli1lacZ activity HHIP is retained. Dotted lines outline
  the base of the epithelium. Yellow dotted lines label the surface of epithelium.
  Scale bar applies to all images.'
