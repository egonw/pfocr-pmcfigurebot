caption: Activation of dsRNA sensor pathway in response to in vitro transcribed (IVT)
  mRNA preparations. mRNA and dsRNA impurities in the IVT mRNA preparations are lipocomplexed
  and transfected into the cells. While mRNA undergoes cap dependent translation in
  ribosomes, dsRNA impurities are bound by dsRNA specific RNA sensors such as RIG-I
  (sensing short dsRNA, shown in yellow) and MDA5 (sensing long dsRNA, shown in orange)
  to cause cytokine inductions such as type 1 interferon (IFN), interleukin-6 (IL-6),
  and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α).
