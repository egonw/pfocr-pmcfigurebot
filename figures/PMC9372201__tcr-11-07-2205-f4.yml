caption: GLIPR1 improved the migration of SHC-44 and SW1783 cells. (A) Phase-contrast
  images of scratch assay of SHC-44 cells at 0 and 24 h after wound and quantification
  of the area covered. (B) Phase-contrast images of scratch assay of SW1783 cells
  at 0 and 24 h after wound and quantification of the area covered. (*) represents
  a significance compared with the Model group. ****, P<0.0001. NC, normal group;
  Model, model group.
