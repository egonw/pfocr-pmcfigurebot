caption: PMVK knockdown induces p53-mediated cell proliferation. (a) qRT‒PCR analysis
  of PMVK, p21/CDKN1A, BAX, NOXA, PUMA, and SREBF2 in MCF-7 cells transfected with
  control or PMVK siRNAs and treated with or without geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate
  (GGPP) for 60 h (n = 4 or 6, mean ± SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ****p < 0.0001 by
  one-way ANOVA). (b) Western blotting for PMVK, c-Myc, p53, p21/CDKN1A, and actin
  in MCF-7 cells transfected with control or PMVK siRNAs for 48 h. (c) p53 WT MCF-7
  cells were transfected with control or PMVK siRNAs and subjected to a cell proliferation
  assay. Error bars represent the SD of the mean (n = 4, *p < 0.05, ****p < 0.0001
  by one-way ANOVA). (d) MCF-7 cells were transfected with control or PMVK siRNAs
  for 64 h. The effect of PMVK knockdown on cell apoptosis was detected via annexin
  V-633/PI double staining of MCF-7 cells and flow cytometry assessment. Representative
  images are shown. (e) The percentages of annexin V-633-positive/PI-negative cells
  (lower right, early apoptosis) and annexin V-633-positive/PI-positive cells (upper
  right, late apoptosis) were quantified. (n = 3, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 by one-way
  ANOVA). (f) MCF-7 cells were transfected with control or PMVK siRNA, treated with
  geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) for 48 h and subjected to an EdU assay with
  flow cytometry analysis. For the control sample, 70% methanol was added. Representative
  images are shown. (g) The proportion of cells in the S phase was quantitated and
  plotted (n = 3). Error bars represent the SDs of the means. ****p < 0.0001 (one-way
  ANOVA).
