figure_title: SMAD4-S367F mutant CD8+ T cells exhibit impaired cytotoxicity
caption: (A) Expression levels of GZMB in empty control, SMAD4-WT, or SMAD4-S367F
  retrovirus–infected CD8+ T cells. CD8+ T cells from Cd8CreSmad4fl/fl mice were isolated
  and infected with empty control retrovirus or retrovirus containing either WT or
  S367F mutant Smad4. Forty-eighty hours after infection, GZMB expression was measured
  by flow cytometry. (B) LM-OVA CFUs from spleens and livers were calculated at day
  7 after infection. OT-I cells isolated from Cd8CreSmad4fl/fl OT-I mice were infected
  with empty control retrovirus or retrovirus containing either WT or S367F mutant
  Smad4. The infected OT-I cells (EGFP+ cells) were sorted and intravenously transferred
  into C57BL/6 mice. Twelve hours later, LM-OVA (2 × 104 CFUs per mouse) was also
  intravenously injected into the recipient mice. (C) Expression of GZMB in splenic
  OT-I cells. Measured by flow cytometry. (D) E.G7 cells (1 × 106 cells per mouse)
  were inoculated subcutaneously into TCRbd−/− mice. Tumor growth were monitored from
  day 9 after inoculation. OT-I cells isolated from Cd8CreSmad4fl/fl OT-I mice were
  infected with retrovirus containing either WT or S367F mutant Smad4. The infected
  OT-I cells (EGFP+ cells) were sorted and intravenously transferred into E.G7-bearing
  TCRbd−/− mice at day 9 after E.G7 cells inoculation. (E) Expression of GZMB, TNFα,
  and IFN-γ in CD8+ TILs from E.G7-bearing TCRbd−/− mice was measured by flow cytometry.
  Data are represented as means ± SEM. The statistics were performed by Student’s
  t test. *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001.
