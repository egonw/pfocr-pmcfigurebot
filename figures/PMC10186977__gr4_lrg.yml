caption: Multi-omics integration reveals the landscape of time-resolved host responses(A)
  Workflow of MOFA integrating the four omics datasets.(B) MOFA deconstructed vast
  variances into 15 factors in PLT-T, PLT-P, PLM-T, and PLM-M.(C) Correlation analysis
  of the top 15 MOFA factors with clinical parameters.(D) Top 15 MOFA factors were
  classified into three groups and two waves of host responses. AR, acute response;
  PR, persistent response; CR, convalescence response; and Var.%, percentage of variances
  explained.(E) Differences of factors among distinct Omicron phases (left) along
  with top-weighted features from the four omics datasets (right) in the AR group.
  Red font indicates positive weighting, whereas blue font shows negative weighting.(F–I)
  Pathway enrichment analyses utilizing the four omics datasets for each factor from
  the three response groups. Red dots indicate enrichment in positive changes, whereas
  blue dots show enrichment in negative changes in Omicron patients compared with
  healthy controls.(J) Pathway enrichment of the platelet proteome in factor 1. The
  x axis shows enriched pathways, whereas the y axis shows the −log (10) p value.See
