caption: TLR-induced metabolic rewiring is lost in MyD88-deficient macrophages. (A,
  B) Gene Ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis was conducted on MPLA-treated
  WT, MyD88-KO (MKO), and TRIF-KO (TKO) bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) for
  metabolism-related pathways and displayed by significance of pathway induction (A).
  Differential expression of genes in metabolism-related GO pathways are shown by
  heatmap (B). (C, D) Glycolysis stress test was performed using Seahorse Xfe96 which
  measured extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) of TLR agonist-treated (MPLA, M;
  CpG, C; Poly I:C, P) or unstimulated (US) WT (left) MKO (middle), and TKO (right)
  BMDMs (C). Peak glycolysis was measured (D). (E, F) Mitochondrial stress test was
  performed under the same experimental parameters and oxygen consumption rate (OCR)
  is presented for WT (left), MKO (middle), and TKO (right) BMDMs (E). Peak respiration
  was measured (F). Data are shown as mean ± SEM, n = 3-5/group *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01
  by ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post-hoc multiple comparison test.
