caption: Capacity for intercellular communication among developing skeletal muscles.
  (A) Diagram of the ligand–receptor pairs at the FB stage. The number (up) and intensity
  (down) of cell interactions (ligand–receptor pairs) are presented generally, in
  which coloured dots indicate different cell groups, and the lines with arrows point
  to cell groups expressing the cognate receptors. The line thickness is proportional
  to the number (up) or strength (down) of ligand–receptor pairs, and the loops refer
  to autocrine circuits. (B) Hierarchical plot showing inferred cell interactions
  at the FB stage. Solid and open circles refer to the source and target, respectively.
  Lines represent intercellular interactions, and their thickness is proportional
  to the communication probability of the cell interaction. Line colours are consistent
  with the signalling source. (C) Heatmap shows the role (sender, receiver, mediator
  or influencer) of each cell group in WNT signalling at the FB stage. (D) Diagram
  of ligand–receptor pair contribution to WNT signalling pathway at the FB stage.
  (E) The outgoing communication patterns of secreting cells at the FB stage. The
  flow thickness represents the contribution of a signalling pathway to each mode
  of communication. (F) The inferred incoming communication patterns of target cells
  at the FB stage.
