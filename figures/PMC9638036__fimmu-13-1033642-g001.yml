caption: 'Canonical signaling pathway for three TGF-β superfamily members: bone morphogenetic
  proteins (BMPs), activins, and growth and differentiation factors (GDFs). Ligand
  binding induces the formation of a heteromeric receptor complex, resulting in constitutively
  active type II receptors transphosphorylating and activating type I receptors. The
  signal is transduced intracellularly via phosphorylated R-SMADs (such as R-SMAD1/5/8
  or R-SMAD2/3). R-SMADs form complexes with Co-SMADs (such as SMAD4), which collectively
  serve as transcription factors that regulate target gene expression in the nucleus.'
