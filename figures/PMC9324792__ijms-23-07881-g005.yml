caption: GO-term analysis of the BP, CC, and MF categories enrichment and the KEGG
  pathway analysis with the 121 differentially expressed genes in THP-1HDC cells,
  compared to THP-1LDC cells for up-regulated genes (a) and down-regulated genes (b).
  Statistical significance was determined using the Bonferroni step-down test and
  a two-tailed hypergeometric enrichment/depletion test. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.001.
