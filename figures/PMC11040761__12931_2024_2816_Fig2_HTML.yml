caption: 'LysoPC activated lung fibroblast and promoted mice lung fibrosis. A UPLC-MS
  analyzed the lipid signature of serum of IPF patient, principal components analysis
  of overall serum profiles of lipid molecules in IPF patients (n = 8) and healthy
  control (n = 7) (upper); KEGG pathway analysis showed that top alter lipid metabolic
  pathway was enriched in glycerophospholipid and choline metabolism (lower). B, UPLC-MS
  analyzed the lipid signature of Bleomycin treated A549 supernatant. C, GO analysis
  showed the top alter lipid metabolic pathway was enriched in glycerophospholipid
  and choline metabolism. D, Bleomycin treated A549 supernatant significantly activated
  lung fibroblast. E, LysoPC identified from UPLC-MS could activate lung fibroblast
  in vitro. F,G, LysoPC (14:0) promoted experimental mice lung fibrosis which was
  comparable to the effects of Bleomycin as showed by histological analysis, scale
  bar = 20 μm, hydroxyproline content and western blot detection of fibrotic markers.
  H, Relative protein expression analysis of fibrotic markers of lung fibroblast and
  mice upon treatment of LysoPC. Data are expressed as mean ± SD, *: p < 0.05; **:
  p < 0.01'
