figure_title: GPSM1 loss inhibits the pro-inflammatory signaling pathway via TNFAIP3
caption: a Venn diagram showing overlap of differentially expressed genes from two
  RNA-sequencing datasets. b Immunoblot analysis of A20 in BMDMs isolated from GPSM1f/f;
  Lyz2-cre and littermates following 200 ng/ml LPS treatment for indicated times.
  c Immunoblot analysis of p-IκBα, IκBα, p-P65, P65, and A20 in GPSM1f/f and GPSM1f/f;
  Lyz2-cre BMDMs infected with indicated lentivirus for 72 h and treated with LPS
  for additional indicated times. d–k Metabolic and inflammatory characterization
  of four genotypes mice fed a HFD for 10 weeks. d A20 and GPSM1 protein levels in
  BMDMs. e Body weight curve (left) and the body weight at 10-week HFD (right), n = 8
  biologically independent mice for GPSM1f/fTNFAIP3f/+, Lyz2-cre; and n = 9 biologically
  independent mice for other three genotypes, respectively. f Tissue weights, including
  scWAT, eWAT, BAT, and Liver; n = 8 biologically independent mice for GPSM1f/fTNFAIP3;f/+n = 7
  biologically independent mice for other three genotypes, respectively. g GTT and
  AOC; n = 8 biologically independent mice for TNFAIP3f/+, Lyz2-cre; and n = 7 biologically
  independent mice for other three genotypes, respectively. h ITT and AOC; n = 8 biologically
  independent mice for TNFAIP3f/+, Lyz2-cre; n = 7 biologically independent mice for
  other three genotypes, respectively. i H&E (Scale bars, 50 μm) and F4/80+ IHC (Scale
  bars, 100 μm) staining of eWAT. j Representative flow cytometry analysis and quantification
  of the expression of CD11c from CD45+F4/80+ cells in SVFs from eWAT (n = 4 biologically
  independent mice per group). k RT-PCR analysis indicating mRNA abundance of pro-inflammatory
  and anti-inflammatory genes in eWAT, n = 8 biologically independent mice for GPSM1f/fTNFAIP3f/+
  and GPSM1f/fTNFAIP3f/+, Lyz2-cre; n = 7 biologically independent mice for GPSM1f/f;
  Lyz2-cre and TNFAIP3f/+, Lyz2-cre. Throughout, all independent experiments were
  performed three times with similar results (b–d, i). Data are presented as means ± SEM.
  P values are determined by two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple-comparisons test
  (e, g, and h) or one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple-comparisons test (e–h, j, k).
  For e, g, and h, P values are compared with GPSM1f/fTNFAIP3f/+ group.
