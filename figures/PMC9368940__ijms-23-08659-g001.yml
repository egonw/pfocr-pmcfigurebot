caption: Bioenergetic metabolism in FPLD2 and control fibroblasts (Fibro) or preadipocytes
  (Pre-adip). (A) Evaluation of the real-time ATP production rate by mitochondrial
  OXPHOS (blue) (█) or by glycolysis (red) (█). Different lower-case letters indicate
  significantly different values (p ≤ 0.05) among cell lines in the same metabolic
  pathway; different upper-case letters indicate different values (p ≤ 0.05) among
  cell lines in ATP production rates due to the sum of OXPHOS plus glycolysis. (B)
  The ATP rate index, calculated as the ratio between the mitochondrial ATP production
  rate and the glycolytic ATP production rate, is shown on the y-axis (logarithmic
  scale) in fibroblasts FPLD2 and control and preadipocytes FPLD2 and control. Different
  lower-case letters indicate significantly different values (p ≤ 0.05) among cell
  lines. (C) The mitochondrial respiration profile in cell lines is evaluated as OCR
  under basal respiration conditions and after the addition of 1.5 μM olig, 2.0 μM,
  or 3.0 μM FCCP with fibroblasts and preadipocytes, respectively, and a mixture of
  0.5 μM rot + AA. Compound injections are shown as dotted lines. (D) Mitochondrial
  parameters (basal respiration, ATP production, proton leak, maximal respiration,
  spare respiratory capacity, non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption, ATP turnover)
  in FPLD2 fibroblasts (blue) (█), in FPLD2 preadipocytes (orange) (█), in control
  fibroblasts (grey) (█), and control preadipocytes (gold) (█). Different letters
  indicate significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) among treatments within the same parameter.
  Data expressed as column charts ((A,C) plots) and points ((B,D) plots), represent
  the mean ± SD (vertical bars) from three experiments carried out on different cell
  preparations.
