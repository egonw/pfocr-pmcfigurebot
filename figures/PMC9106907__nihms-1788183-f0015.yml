caption: Sustained IL-2R signaling reprograms Treg energetic metabolism. (a) Overlap
  between DEGs upregulated by mIL-2/CD25 at 72 hr post single injection (FDR<0.01;
  fold change â‰¥ 1.5 X) and a set of mouse mitochondrial genes from the database Mitocarta
  3.0. (b) Significant (upregulated, red; down-regulated, green) DEGs in the oxidative
  phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway in response to single injection of mIL-2/CD25 shown
  as components within each electron transport chain complex.

  T cells after varied duration of interleukin-2 receptor signaling.
