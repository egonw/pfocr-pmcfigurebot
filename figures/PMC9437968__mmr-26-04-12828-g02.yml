caption: Ori reduces inflammatory response and oxidative stress in DSS-induced UC
  mice. ELISA kits were used to analyze (A) MPO concentration and (B) inflammatory
  factors in colon tissue. (C) Detection of proteins involved in oxidative stress
  were analyzed in colon tissue. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001. DSS, dextran sulfate
  sodium; UC, ulcerative colitis; Ori, oridonin; H, high-dose; L, low-dose; MPO, myeloperoxidase;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; SOD, superoxide dismutase; MDA, malondialdehyde; GSH-Px,
  glutathione peroxidase.
