caption: Functional clustering annotation of N-glycoproteins with down-regulation
  of the high-mannose-type induced by 2DG. (A) The enriched biological processes associated
  with the down-regulation of the high-mannose-type, including the integrinâˆ’mediated
  signaling pathway, lysosomal transport, protein targeting to lysosome, protein hydroxylation,
  and protein N-glycosylation via asparagine, etc. (B) The corresponding enriched
  molecular functions, including virus receptor activity, exogenous protein binding,
  integrin binding, transferase activity, transferring hexosyl group, retromer complex
  binding, and collagen binding, etc. (C) Exemplification of the functional clusters
  of glycoproteins with down-regulated high-mannose, hybrid, and complex types. (D)
  Exemplification of networks of biological processes involved in glycoproteins with
  down-regulated N-glycosylation with high-mannose, hybrid, and complex types.
