figure_title: Overexpression of miR-181d inhibits renal fibrosis in vivo and in vitro
caption: A A box plot of the expression of miR-181d in GSE125305 dataset. The blue
  box on the left indicates the expression in normal control samples (n = 9), and
  the red box on the right indicates the expression in renal fibrosis samples (n = 9).
  B RT-qPCR analysis of α-SMA, Col4α1, and TGF-βR1 expression in HK-2 cells. C Masson’s
  trichrome staining of collagen deposition in UUO rats after treatment with BMSC-EVs
  (n = 8). D Sirius red staining of collagen deposition in renal tissues from UUO
  rats after treatment with miR-181d agomir (n = 8). E In situ hybridization to assess
  miR-181d expression in renal tissues from UUO rats after injection of miR-181d agomir
  (n = 8). F Immunohistochemistry assay of Col4α1 and α-SMA in renal tissues from
  UUO rats after injection of miR-181d agomir (n = 8). G Western blot analysis of
  Col4α1, α-SMA/TGF-βR1 and collagen I expression in renal tissues from UUO rats after
  injection of miR-181d agomir. *p < 0.05 vs. rats treated with agomir NC. The cell
  experiment was repeated three independent times.
