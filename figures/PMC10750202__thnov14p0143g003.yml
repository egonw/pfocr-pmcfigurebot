caption: 'Regulatory mechanisms of circular RNAs (circRNAs) during Wnt/β-catenin and
  bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-mediated human mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) osteogenic
  differentiation. CircRNAs are able to positively and/or negatively regulate MSCs
  osteogenesis by molecularly sponging numerous miRNAs, inhibiting, in turn, the miRNA-mediated
  regulatory activity on downstream osteogenic target genes. This regulatory activity
  can occur on different target genes implicated in (A) Wnt/β-catenin pathway, (B)
  bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway. § miRNAs previously reported
  as implicated in Wnt/β-catenin pathway (Zhang et al., 2017). # predicted mechanism.
