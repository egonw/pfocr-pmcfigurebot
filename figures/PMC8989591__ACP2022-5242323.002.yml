caption: 'Detection of cell aging, cell apoptosis, and related molecules in different
  groups: WT+sham group, WT+I/R group, ALK4+/-+sham group, and ALK4+/-+I/R group.
  (a) HE staining of cell aging. (b and c) Detection of protein expressions of TGFβ,
  AKT1, STAT3, and NF-κB (Western blotting). (d–g) Detection of protein expressions
  of phosphorylated Smad2/3 (p-Smad2/3), Smad4, Smad6, and Smad7 (Western blotting).
  (h) Green: apoptotic cells (TUNEL staining); blue: nuclei (DAPI counterstaining,
  ×400). ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01, WT+I/R group vs. WT+sham group. #P < 0.05 and ##P
  < 0.01, ALK4+/-+I/R group vs. WT+I/R group.'
