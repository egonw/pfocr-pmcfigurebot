caption: (a) Reaction pathways of CHI3 photolysis in methanol and cyclohexane, adapted
  from the literature. (b) Potential signal components for CHI3 photolysis in cyclohexane,
  predicted based on the null hypothesis that the reaction pathway for cyclohexane
  is the same as that assigned for methanol. (c) ΔS(q, t)exp from a TRXL experiment
  on CHI3 in cyclohexane, and ΔS(q, t)PEPC obtained by applying the PEPC method to
  ΔS(q, t)exp. The contributions of the four signal components shown in (b) are removed
  from ΔS(q, t)exp via PEPC. The remaining signal in ΔS(q, t)PEPC indicates that the
  null hypothesis is not true, and the reaction pathways are different for cyclohexane
  and methanol. (d) The first RSV obtained from the SVD analysis of ΔS(q, t)PEPC (dots).
  The kinetics of the first RSV agrees well with the time-dependent concentration
  profile of iso-CHI2–I retrieved using GFA (solid line), indicating that the remaining
  signal in ΔS(q, t)PEPC is due to the contribution of the reaction pathway yielding
  iso-CHI2–I. (e) The first LSV obtained from the SVD analysis of ΔS(q, t)PEPC (black
  solid line). The LSV is compared with the SADS corresponding to the formation of
  iso-CHI2–I [SADS(iso-CHI2–I), red solid line]. Although the first LSV did not correspond
  well with SADS(iso-CHI2–I), the LSVcorr (black dashed line), which was adjusted
  for the contributions of the signal components excessively removed during the PEPC
  procedure, showed excellent agreement with SADS(iso-CHI2–I). The LSVcorr is described
  as the sum of five terms, LSV, α × (∂S/∂T)ρ, β × (∂S/∂ρ)T, γ × SADS(CHI3 → CHI2
  + I), and δ × SADS(CHI3 → CHI2 + ½ I2) where α, β, γ, and δ are the fitting parameters.
  (f) and (g) The time traces of ΔT(f) and Δρ(g), retrieved from the correct kinetic
  framework that includes the contribution of iso-CHI2–I (dots). Once the kinetics
  of the reaction is determined using PEPC and the solute-related term for each relevant
  chemical species is determined through a subsequent structural analysis, the reconstruction
  of the hydrodynamic response of the solvent is straightforward. ΔT and Δρ for each
  time delay can be retrieved as described in the text. The resulting ΔT and Δρ match
  those determined using GFA (solid lines).
