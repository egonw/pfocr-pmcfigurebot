caption: 'Increased phospho-p38/phospho-CDC25B expression after neuronal differentiation
  further increases neurite length(A and B) On day 5 after the induction of neuronal
  differentiation from hiPSC-NS/PCs, DMSO (A) or RK-682 (B) was added, and neurons
  were cultured for 48 h. Representative images obtained by the time-lapse method
  are shown. Scale bars: 50 μm.(C) Magnified images of neurites elongated by RK-682.
  Scale bars: 50 μm.(D) RK-682 was added to the neurons, and the degree of neurite
  outgrowth was measured and quantified 2 days later. All neurons in four visual fields
  were quantified for each experiment (n = 3; p = 0.0494).Statistical analyses were
  performed with unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-tests. The values in the bar graphs
  represent the means ± SEs. ∗p < 0.05.'
