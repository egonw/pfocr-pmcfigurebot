caption: 'The mice in Fig.  were used to complete following assays: (A–C) Serum insulin
  level (A), ITT (B) or GTT (C) assay at the E14 or E15, and quantitation of areas
  under curves (AUC). (D) Expression of protein related to insulin signaling pathway
  in mouse liver was determined by Western blot. (E) HE staining of mice pancreas
  sections. (F) Immunofluorescent staining with anti-glucagon (green) or anti-insulin
  (red) antibodies of mice pancreas sections, and the ratio of beta cell area (insulin-positive)
  to alpha cell area (glucagon-positive) was calculated, n = 5. (G) The protein expression
  of ChREBP was determined by immunofluorescent staining with quantification of the
  mean immunofluorescence intensity (MFI) of images. (H) HE staining of liver sections.
  (I) triglyceride (TG) quantification in the liver. n = 5. Data information: All
  graphs are represented as Mean ± SEM, n: biological replicates. Two-way ANOVA followed
  by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was used. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001,
  NS: no significance vs. indicated group. .'
