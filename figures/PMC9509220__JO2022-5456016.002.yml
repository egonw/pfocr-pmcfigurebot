caption: PDLIM1 hampers GC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and boosts
  apoptosis. A cell model of PDLIM1 overexpression was built in MKN-45 and AGS cells.
  (a) RT-qPCR confirmed the profile of PDLIM1. (b, c) CCK8 and BrdU verified the viability
  of MKN-45 and AGS cells. (d) Transwell detected GC cell invasion and migration.
  (e) Flow cytometry examined cell apoptosis. ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001 (vs. the NC
  group). N = 3.
