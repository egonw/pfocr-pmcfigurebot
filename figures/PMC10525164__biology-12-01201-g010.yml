caption: Changes in the mRNA expression levels of LymFOXO, LymG6Pase, LymPEPCK, LymCatalase,
  LymAKT, LymPI3K, and LymmTOR in the whole CNSs under different food deprivation
  conditions (i.e., food-satiated Day −1 snails and food-deprived Day 1 snails). LymG6Pase,
  LymPEPCK, and LymCatalase are target genes of LymFOXO. LymPI3K, LymAKT, and LymmTOR
  are insulin signaling pathway genes. The mRNA expression levels were normalized
  to β-actin and β-tubulin RNAs, and the expression of each gene is shown as the relative
  expression level (RQ), with that in Day −1 snails set as 1. * p < 0.05. N = 5 each.
