caption: 'Regulatory network of HMGA1 in the digestive system. Liver cancer: TCF-4
  enhances the transcriptional activity of HMGA1 and causes resistance to paclitaxel.
  HMGA1 acts on E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM65 to activate the Î²-catenin pathway. Gastric
  cancer: HMGA1 and c-Myc form positive feedback in the regulation of glycolysis,
  and miR-195 negatively regulates HMGA1 to cause resistance to 5-FU. Colorectal cancer:
  HMGA1 upregulates the expression of CTNNB1, SAC and Sox9 to maintain the self-renewal
  of colon cancer cells. Pancreatic cancer, HMGA1 participates in the regulation of
  the cell cycle by interacting with the nucleoprotein complexes formed by SP1, AP2
  and C/EBPh. Metformin can also indirectly participate in the regulation of HMGA1
  to inhibit the progression of colorectal cancer. In addition, HMGA1 can increase
  the expression of COX-2 and promote pancreatic tumorigenesis.'
