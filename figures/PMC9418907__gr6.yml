caption: TCDD-elicited effects on the genes involved in the itaconate pathway.A, schematic
  overview of the pathway. Hepatic expression of (B) Acod1 was determined by qRT-PCR.
  Hepatic expression of (D) Auh and Clybl was determined by RNA-Seq. Time-course analysis
  was performed after a single bolus oral gavage of 30 μg/kg TCDD. Dose-dependent
  expression was determined following treated with sesame oil vehicle or TCDD (0.01–30 μg/kg)
  every 4 days for 28 days. The effect of TCDD on the diurnal rhythmicity of (C) Acod1,
  (E) Auh, (G) Clybl in male C57BL/6 mice following oral gavage with sesame oil vehicle
  or 30 μg/kg TCDD every 4 days for 28 days. Posterior probabilities (∗P1(t) ≥ 0.80)
  comparing vehicle and TCDD were determined using an empirical Bayes method. Diurnal
  rhythmicity was assessed using JTK_CYCLE (‡ indicates q ≤ 0.1). Data are double-plotted
  along the x-axis to better visualize rhythmic pattern. F, time-dependent hepatic
  expression of macrophages markers. Male C57BL/6 mice (n = 3) were administered a
  single bolus dose of 30 μg/kg TCDD. Liver samples were collected at the corresponding
  time point. The presence of putative dioxin response elements (pDREs) and AhR enrichment
  are represented as green boxes. Color scale represents the log2(fold change) for
  differential gene expression determined by RNA-Seq analysis. Counts represent the
  maximum raw number of aligned reads to each transcript where a lower level of expression
  (≤500 reads) is depicted in yellow and a higher level of expression (≥10,000) is
  depicted in pink. Differential expression with a posterior probability (P1(t)) >
  0.80 is indicated with a black triangle in the upper right tile corner. H, effects
  of TCDD on MUT activity. MUT activity was measured by thiokinase-coupled spectrophotometric
  assay where the product, succinyl-CoA, is converted by a second enzyme, thiokinase,
  to succinate and CoA. Formation of CoA was monitored by the thiol-sensitive reagent,
  DTNB, which forms a mixed disulfide with CoA and the nitrobenzene thiolate anion
  (TNB). Results are expressed as μmol TNB formed/minute/mg of protein. Asterisk (∗)
  denotes p < 0.05 determined by one-way ANOVA with a Dunnett’s post-hoc test (n =
  6). I, itaconic acid in liver extracts from male mice orally gavaged every 4 days
  for 28 days with sesame oil vehicle or TCDD measured by LC-MS. Asterisk (∗) denotes
  p < 0.05 determined by one-way ANOVA with a Dunnett’s post-hoc test (n = 4). Error
  bars represent ± SD. TCDD, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin; AHR, aryl hydrocarbon
  receptor; MUT, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid).
