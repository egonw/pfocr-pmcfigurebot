caption: Hypothetical pathways of melatonin and its metabolites in the treatment of
  COVID-19. (1) Melatonin has a direct free radical scavenging capacity. However,
  this effect is not receptor-dependent. (2) The metabolites of melatonin protect
  the COVID-19-infected cells from oxidative damage byexhibiting strong antioxidant
  effects. (3) Melatonin inhibits protein kinase A (PKA) and Ca2+signaling that could
  modulate gene transcription regulation and antioxidant enzyme concentration. (4)
  Melatonin may lower Ca2+ concentration, which can be influenced to regulate various
  mitogen protein kinases related to the PKC-mediated signaling pathway, i.e., extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), NF-ÎºB, or PI3/Akt
  pathway activation, and thus modulate gene transcription. (5) Binding with MT1/MT2,
  melatonin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway and inhibits free radicals, nitric
  oxide synthases, inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress.
