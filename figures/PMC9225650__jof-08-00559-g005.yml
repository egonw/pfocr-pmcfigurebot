caption: RTT109Hz/FUN30Hz double mutant shows a differential response to genotoxic
  stress. (A). Expression of FUN30, RTT109, SNF2, TEL1, MEC1, RAD9, MRC1, and RAD5
  was evaluated in FUN30myc and RTT109Hz/FUN30mycHz strains using qPCR. (B). Expression
  of FUN30, RTT109, SNF2, TEL1, MEC1, RAD9, MRC1, and RAD5 was evaluated in BWP17
  and RTT109Hz/FUN30Hz strains using qPCR. (C). Expression of RDN18, UBC13, and EFB1
  was analyzed by qPCR in RTT109Hz/FUN30mycHz strain. (D). Sensitivity of FUN30myc,
  RTT109Hz, FUN30Hz, and RTT109Hz/FUN30mycHz strains was studied in the presence of
  CPT (100 µM), H2O2 (7.5 mM), and MMS (0.02%). (E). Sensitivity of BWP17, RTT109Hz,
  FUN30Hz, and RTT109Hz/FUN30Hz strains was studied in the presence of CPT, H2O2,
  and MMS. The qPCR data are presented as average ± s.e.m. of three biological replicates.
  * p < 0.05. In the case of plate assays, five-fold serial dilutions were prepared
  and spotted on respective plates. The plates were incubated at 30 °C and imaged
  after 24 h.
