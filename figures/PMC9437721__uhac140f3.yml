caption: Functional characterization of candidate IiOMT proteins. (A) UPLC chromatograms
  of the reactions of IiOMTs with SAM and isoorientin as substrates. (B) A proposed
  biosynthetic pathway for isoscoparin in I. indigotica. (C) MS spectra of compounds
  1 and 1a in negative mode. The maximum UV absorption peaks of the reactions are
  350Â nm.
