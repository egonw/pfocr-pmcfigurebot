caption: SOST was significantly elevated in the in vivo MI model. (A) Echocardiographic
  measurements and histochemical staining analyses, including H&E, Masson, and Sirius
  Red staining, were performed to confirm the successful construction of the MI model
  (Bar =50 µm). Quantitative analysis of LVEDD, LVESD, LVEF, LVFS, myocyte size and
  fibrotic area are shown in the right panels. (B) The mRNA expression of SOST in
  the heart tissues was detected by qRT-PCR. (C) Western blot was used to detect the
  protein expression of SOST in the heart tissues, with GAPDH as the internal control.
  (D) ELISA was performed to detect the contents of SOST in the different groups.
  The data are presented as the mean ± SD (n=3). **P<0.01, model group vs. sham group.
  SOST, sclerostin; H&E, hematoxylin and eosin; LVEDD, left ventricular end diastolic
  dimension; LVESD, left ventricular end systolic dimension; LVEF, left ventricular
  ejection fraction; LVFS, left ventricular fractional shortening; MI, myocardial
  infarction; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; SD, standard deviation.
