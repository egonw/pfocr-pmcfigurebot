caption: 'Effect of metabolic pathway optimization on PPD production. (a) Residual
  glucose, (b) ethanol consumption, (c) cell growth, (d) DM-II and PPD titers of PPD-producing
  strains. Data are presented as the means of three replicates, and bars represent
  the standard deviations. Asterisks or pounds denote statistically significant differences
  from BY-II as determined by a Student’s t-test (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001;
  #P < 0.05; ##P < 0.01; ###P < 0.001)'
