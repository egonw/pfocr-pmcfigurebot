caption: Scheme of the ISO neuroprotective mechanism in diabetic CIRI.Ischaemic stroke
  induced an inflammatory response and autophagy activation in diabetic mice. ISO
  inhibited TLR4 activation and downstream NF-κB p65 phosphorylation, resulting in
  suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome formation. Finally, the proinflammatory factor IL-1β
  accumulation was descended. In addition, ISO alleviated the overactivation of autophagy.
  In summary, ISO attenuated CIRI and provided a neuroprotective effect.
