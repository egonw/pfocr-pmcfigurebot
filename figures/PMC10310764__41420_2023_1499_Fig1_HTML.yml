figure_title: Downregulation of miR-375 was associated with poor prognosis in LUSC
caption: A Representative pictures of the RNAscope assay showing the expression of
  miR-375 in cancer and paracarcinoma tissues, magnification ×40 and ×200, respectively.
  B The scores of miR-375 expression in cancer and paracarcinoma tissues. C, D MiR-375
  expression levels in unpaired (C) and paired (D) LUSC tissues (n = 502) and normal
  tissues (n = 49) from TCGA. E The ROC curve distinguished normal from LUSC tumor
  tissue, with an AUC of 0.801. F Relationship between miR-375 expression and OS was
  assessed by a Kaplan–Meier plot. The log-rank test was conducted to indicate statistically
  significant differences among the survival curves. G qRT-PCR of the expression of
  miR-375 in four LUSC cell lines compared to that in HBE cells. Amplification of
  U6 served as an internal control.
