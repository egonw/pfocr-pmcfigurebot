caption: The work done by a physiologic pathway with hysteresis is the area enclosed
  by a PV loop. The work during left ventricular systole is shown in (A), and the
  work during left ventricular diastole is shown in (B). Net work of a cardiac cycle
  is the work of systole subtracting that of diastole (C). By the same principle,
  the work done by inspiration (D) subtracting that of expiration (E) results in a
  net work of a respiratory cycle (F). Both net works of a cardiac and respiratory
  cycle are the hysteresis areas of PV loops
