figure_title: RNF43 is a direct target of miR-181d-5p
caption: A predictive interaction of miR-181d-5p in RNF43 mRNA 3′-UTR by TargetScan
  and RNAhybrid, and mutation of the indicated nucleotides in seed sequences. B Dual-luciferase
  reporter assays of the effects of miR-181d-5p mimics and inhibitors on wild-3′-UTR
  and mut-3′-UTR in ACHN cells. C Western Blot analysis of RNF43 and β-catenin levels
  in ACHN and 786-O cells transfected with miR-181d-5p mimics, inhibitors, or corresponding
  controls, as well as in ACHN and 786-O cells pre-treated with NF-Exo or CAF-Exo.
  D Enrichment profile of the WNT signaling pathway in high vs low CAF score RCC tumors
  using GSEA, (ES = -0.526, P < 0.0001). Cell experiment was repeated three times
  independently, P value between two groups was obtained by Unpaired t test. ***P < 0.001.
