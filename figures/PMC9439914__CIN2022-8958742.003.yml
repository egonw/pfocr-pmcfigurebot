caption: Changes in mechanical pain threshold in rats after establishing a central
  pain model after stroke. Compared with the Sham group, the MWT value of the left
  plantar in the CPSP group was decreased (P < 0.05); compared with the CPSP group,
  the MWT value in the AP group was increased (P < 0.05); compared with the AP group,
  MWT value in EX527 group was increased (P < 0.05).
