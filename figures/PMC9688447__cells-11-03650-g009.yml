caption: 'TMAO promoted neuronal oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome signaling
  through a SIRT1-based pathway within 2VO rats. (A) PCC and (B) MDA levels, and (C)
  SOD and (D) GPX activity within the rat hippocampi were measured based on the kit
  manufacturer’s instructions (n = 6). (E) Representative bands of the NLRP3 and IL-1β
  protein expression within the rat hippocampi across the groups (n = 6). Quantification
  for (F) NLRP3 and (G) IL-1β protein expression is shown as a bar chart. β-actin
  served as a loading control (n = 6). Datasets reflect the mean ± SD. ##p < 0.01
  versus the 2VO group; &p < 0.05 and &&p < 0.01 versus the 2VO+TMAO+LV-NC group.'
