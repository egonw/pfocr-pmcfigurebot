caption: Empagliflozin decreased Yes-associated protein (YAP) expression in LX-2 cells.
  (a) The representative protein expression of YAP and phospho-YAP was determined
  using Western blot. (b) Quantitation and normalisation of phospho-YAP to total YAP
  or total YAP to β-actin from a. (c) The relative expression of cyr61, cTGF, and
  AREG was determined via RT-PCR. Data are expressed as means ± standard deviation
  of three independent experiments. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 compared
  to the control.
