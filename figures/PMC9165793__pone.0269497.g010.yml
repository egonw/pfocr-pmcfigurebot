figure_title: The composed modular bond graph model of EGFR-Ras-MAPK signalling pathway
caption: 'The blue dashed boxes represent the bond graph modules, the yellow boxes
  show the merged common components between the modules (each sharing a common potential
  by a ‘0: u’ junction), and the blue harpoons represent the bonds between the modules
  and common components. The inter-module bonds, along with the internal bonds between
  the components in each module, are defined and automatically applied to the model
  using the whole connectivity matrix. The EGFR and MAPK cycles also share common
  potentials with CS:ATP, CS:ADP, and CS:Pi.'
