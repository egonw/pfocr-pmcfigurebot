caption: TRPCs function in stem cells. TRPC1-induced Ca2+ influx activates the FGF/FGFR1
  signaling pathway or OTX2 to promote proliferation or differentiation of NSCs. TRPC3
  triggers Ca2+ influx in mitochondria, which promotes the stabilization of differentiation
  processes of ESCs to NSCs. High expression of TRPC5 in A2B5+ NPCs with increased
  store-operated Ca2+ entry promotes cell differentiation. Further, the dynamic distribution
  of TRPC6 can control the magnitude of store-operated Ca2+ entry via changes in membrane
  potential to regulate the cell cycle of BMSCs.
