caption: Exploration of immune infiltration characteristics and exhaustion pathways
  in risk score subgroups. (A) Proportion of immune cell infiltration in different
  risk score subgroups, scatter represents the score, the middle horizontal line of
  the box diagram represents the median, and the upper and lower horizontal lines
  represent 25% and 75%. (B) The KM curve compared the survival rate of CD8+T cell
  subgroups. (C) Differences in immunotherapy (anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4) between
  high and low risk score subgroups. (D) Heatmap of GSVA enrichment results. The darker
  the color, the more significant the enrichment, red represents a positive correlation,
  green represents a negative correlation. (E) Correlation between Notch pathway and
  exhaustion genes and risk scores. The darker the color, the more significant the
  enrichment, the redder the higher the degree of positive correlation. (F) Expression
  of NOTCH1 in risk score subgroups. (G) Correlation of NOTCH1 with risk scores. *,
  p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p<0.001.
