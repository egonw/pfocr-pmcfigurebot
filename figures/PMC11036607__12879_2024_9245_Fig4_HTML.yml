caption: Biological ramifications of variations in blood components. A KEGG analysis
  revealed a significant activation of complement and coagulation-related pathways
  in patients with severe/critical symptoms. B GO analysis uncovered significant abnormalities
  in the extracellular matrix, cell membrane function, and platelet-related pathways
  in patients with severe/critical symptoms. C Provides a detailed breakdown of the
  GO analysis, primarily categorized into biological process (BP), cellular component
  (CC), and molecular function (MF) categories. D Reactome analysis identified significant
  abnormalities in immune responses, hemostasis, platelet, extracellular matrix, cell
  membrane function, and vascular wall-related pathways in patients with severe/critical
  symptoms. E Offers a detailed explanation of the Reactome analysis. F GSEA offers
  a further interpretation of the KEGG analysis for a single pathway. Multiple pathway
  analyses were focused on vWF, and the most representative GSEA analysis is presented
  here
