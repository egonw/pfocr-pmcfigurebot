caption: The effects of FDLE on NF-κB-mediated cell cycle proteins in non-inflammatory
  and inflammatory HCT-116 and HT-29 colorectal cancer cell line. (A,B) Western blot
  analysis of NF-κB-mediated proteins related to cell cycle in non-inflammatory HCT-116
  and HT-29 cells treated with three doses (50, 100 and 200 µg/mL) of FDLE for 48
  h. (C,D) Western blot analysis of NF-κB-mediated proteins related to cell cycle
  in inflammatory HCT-116 and HT-29 cells treated with three doses (50, 100 and 200
  µg/mL) of FDLE for 48 h after adding a mixture of cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ and LPS
  each 10 ng/mL) for 2 h. Densitometric quantification was performed by image software.
  The results were represented as mean ± SD of three independent experiments, * p
  < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001. The whole western blots are
  shown in .
