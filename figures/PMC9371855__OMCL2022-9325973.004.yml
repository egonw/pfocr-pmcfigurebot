caption: Effect of IDOAMP on RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL signaling pathways in PC3 cells. (a)
  The phosphorylation levels of RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL in PC3 cells from different
  groups were detected by western blotting, and the representative bands are shown.
  Levels of RIPK1 (b), RIPK3 (c), and MLKL (d) were normalized to those in the control-treated
  conditions. The results are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3). ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p <
  0.01 vs. the control group.
