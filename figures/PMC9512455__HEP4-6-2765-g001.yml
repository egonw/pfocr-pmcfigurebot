caption: 'BA and glucose metabolism and gut dysbiosis in Baat −/−  mice. Baat gene
  deletion reduces conjugated bile acids and increases unconjugated BAs dramatically
  in hepatocytes. Although BA excretion to the gallbladder is reduced due to higher
  affinity for conjugated BAs of bile salt export pump (BSEP), genes encoding basolateral
  BA export pumps (multidrug resistance‐associated protein 4 [MRP4] and OSTα/β) and
  hydroxylating enzymes such as CYP3A11, CYP2C70, and Cyp2A12 are increased in hepatocytes,
  which helps reduce accumulated unconjugated bile acid toxicity. Due to lower intestinal
  BA concentration, gut microbiota population is higher, but genus Bilophila, a sulfidogenic
  bacteria, is significantly less populated. Almost complete absence of TLCA fails
  to activate the Takeda G protein‐coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) signaling pathway and
  results in lower glucagon‐like peptide 1 (GLP‐1) level in serum. In addition, lower
  hepatic N‐acyl taurine levels due to absence of BAAT and lower synthesis of acyl‐CoA:
  amino acid N‐acyltransferases (ACNATs) lead to impaired glucose‐stimulated insulin
  secretion along with lower blood GLP‐1. ASBT, apical sodium–bile acid transporter;
  CDCA, chenodeoxycholic acid; GK, glucokinase; GLUT2, glucose transporter 2; NATs,
  N‐acyl taurines; NTCP, Na + −taurocholate co‐transporter peptide; OATP, organic
  anion transporting polypeptide.'
