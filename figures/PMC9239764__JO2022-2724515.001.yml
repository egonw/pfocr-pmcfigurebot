caption: Expression of ARL family genes and establishment of risk models in KIRC.
  (a) The differential expression of 22 ARL genes in KIRC versus normal kidney tissues.
  Red and blue colors in the heat map indicate high and low gene expression, respectively.
  The darker the color of red, the higher the gene expression; the darker the color
  of blue, the lower the gene expression. (b) Univariate Cox regression analysis of
  22 ARL genes. (c-d) LASSO regression curve analysis and cross-validation of ARL
  genes. (e-f) Risk scores were calculated from linear combinations of Cox coefficients
  and gene expression. We divided the KIRC patients into high-risk and low-risk groups
  based on the best cutoff value, and the Kaplan–Meier survival curve was generated,
  (P=4.8e − 08). (g) Using the ROC curve to predict 3-year, 5-year, and 7-year survival
  rates. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001.
