caption: 'KDM6B is required for transcriptional activation of the AKT2 gene in HCC
  cells. (A) The mRNA expression levels of AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3 in PLC/PRF/5 and HepG2
  cells after treatment with increasing doses of JIB-04 or DMSO (control) for 24h
  were analyzed using qRT-PCR (AKT1 and AKT2 (n = 3); AKT3 (n = 4)). (B) The mRNA
  expressions of AKT1 and AKT2 in KDM4B-, KDM4D-, and KDM6B-depleted HCC cells (PLC/PRF/5:
  AKT1 (n = 4) and AKT2 (KDM4B-depleted cells n = 5; KDM4D- and KDM6B-depleted cells
  n = 4); HepG2: AKT1 (KDM4B-depleted cells n = 5, KDM4D-depleted cells n = 6, and
  KDM6B-depleted cells n = 3) and AKT2 (KDM4B-depleted cells n = 5, KDM4D-depleted
  cells n = 6, and KDM6B-depleted cells n = 3). (C) Pair-wise correlation between
  KDM6B and AKT2 using the Spearman method. The plot was obtained from the GEPIA database.
  (D) The mRNA expression levels of KDM6B and AKT2 in KDM6B-depleted PLC/PRF/5 cells
  were analyzed using qRT-PCR (n = 4). (E) The enrichment of epigenetic markers in
  AKT2 promoter regions of HepG2 cells after treatment with DMSO (control) or 6 µM
  JIB-04 for 24 was analyzed with ChIP assay (n = 4). (F) The occupancy of KDM6B protein
  in the promoter regions of the AKT2 gene was examined by ChIP assays. Data are represented
  as mean ± SEM of triplicate measurements; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001.'
