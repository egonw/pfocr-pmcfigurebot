caption: A family of proteins linked by the FPL-motif is involved in inflammation.
  Schematic representation of the interactions between proteins of the FPL-motif family,
  the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25, and proteins of the adaptive (left pathway) and
  innate (right pathway) immune response pathways. TRIM25 activates the RIG1 pathway
  of the innate immune response via K63-ubiquitination of RIG1 and TRAF6. On the other
  hand, TRIM25 causes the degradation of MAP4K1, an inhibitor of the adaptive immune
  response via the T-cell (TCR) and B-cell (BCR) receptor pathways. It also degrades
  STAU155. Through competition for dsRNA binding, STAU155 prevents the activation
  of proteins of the innate immune response, such as MDA5 and PKR. STAU155 also up-
  or downregulates the expression of multiple mRNAs coding for proteins of the inflammatory
  and immune response pathways. For example, the STAU155-mediated upregulation of
  IFIT3 and netrin-1 leads to enhanced immune response via the activation of the MAVS
  pathway and inflammation, respectively. TRIM25 also targets other proteins (in red).
  Whether it activates (K63-ubi) or degrades (K48-ubi) these proteins is still unresolved.
  UBE2F activates the NF-κB pathway and interferon production by K63-ubiquitination
  of TRAF6. ABCF1 enhances anti-inflammatory response by K63-ubiquitination-mediated
  activation of TRAF3. In turn, NF-κB binds the promotor of the VCAM1 and GRP83 genes
  and upregulates their expression.
