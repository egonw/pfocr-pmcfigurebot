caption: Signaling pathway linking beta-adrenergic receptors to regulation of the
  epigenome. Norepinephrine couples to ERK signaling which regulates cytoplasmic protein
  synthesis and initiates downstream signals that alter epigenetic markers. During
  NE-LTP, NMDARs are similarly recruited and act synergistically to upregulate translation
  and alter the epigenome. Intracellular signaling mechanisms also recruit (through
  unknown pathway) the epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation
  to increase the transcription of memory enhancing genes leading to increased synthesis
  of plasticity related proteins. The nucleosome is unwrapped in the presence of the
  NE-induced signaling leading to expose the site of the epigenetic modification at
  the DNA and the Histone tails. Therefore, the condensed heterochromatin becomes
  activated euchromatin and thus facilitates further process of transcription. DNMT
  (DNA n-methyl transferase) and HAT (Histone acetyl transferase) are the enzymes
  responsible for the tagging of the DNA and histone proteins(H3) by adding one methyl
  molecule and one acetyl molecule to the DNA and H3 proteins respectively. Other
  post-translational modifications such as histone phosphorylation, ubiquitination,
  methylation, etc., are not shown in this figure to avoid the clumsiness.
