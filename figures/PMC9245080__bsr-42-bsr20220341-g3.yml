figure_title: JB activated the ATR-CHK1 signal pathway in MKN45 cells
caption: The cells were incubated with or without various concentrations of JB for
  24 h. The protein expression levels of ATR, p-ATR, CHK1, p-CHK1, CDC25A, CyclinA,
  CDK2, and r-H2AX were detected by western blotting. Data are expressed as means
  Â± SD of three independent experiments. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 compared with the control
  group.
