caption: SG assembly and disassembly. Various types of stress induce translational
  arrest and poly-some disassembly via the integrated stress response (ISR) and unfolded
  protein response (UPR) pathways. 40S ribosomal subunits, translation initiation
  factors, mRNPs, and RBPs condensate into SGs via liquid–liquid phase separation
  (LLPS). RBPs such as G3BP and UBAP2L are central nodes of the protein–RNA network
  driving LLPS. SGs are disassembled with the help of molecular chaperones and the
  ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), allowing translation to recommence. Mutations
  in RBPs or impairment of protein quality control (PQC) systems mediating SG disassembly
  promote the transformation into aberrant SGs, accumulating misfolded proteins that
  are partially modified with ubiquitin chains (purple circles). Aberrant SGs are
  removed via a selective autophagy pathway termed ‘granulophagy’.
