caption: CD28 activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and regulation of miR29b
  and DNMT3B expression in MM plasma cells (U266 and RPMI 8226 cells). Cells were
  cultured in the presence of 10 µg/mL anti-CD28-loaded particles, alone or with either
  50 µg/mL CD28-blocking mAb (24 h). A Representative western blots of PI3K/AKT pathway
  components in conditions of CD28 stimulation or blocking. B Densitometric analysis
  of the experiment shown in (A). Band intensities were normalized to those of β-actin
  and the relative levels of proteins under CD28 blocking were expressed as a percentage
  of those during CD28 stimulation (dotted line). C Levels of miR29b and DNMT3B mRNA
  under conditions of CD28 blocking normalized to those of RNU44 or GAPDH, respectively,
  and then expressed as fold change relative to the average value for CD28-stimulated
  cells (data from real-time PCR and 2−ΔΔCt method). D Representative western blot
  and E densitometric analysis of DNMT3B expression after CD28 stimulation or blocking.
  Values were normalized to β-actin and then to values for CD28-stimulated cells (dotted
  line). Chart data are mean and SD for 7 independent experiments. *P < .05, Wilcoxon
  signed-rank test
