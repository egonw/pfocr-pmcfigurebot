caption: The effect of knockdown ATF4 on ERS-related, apoptosis-related and mTOR pathway-related
  protein expression levels on TM-treated granulosa cells. (A–K) The protein levels
  of Grp78, ATF4, CHOP, PERK, eIF-2α, BAX, Bxl-2, Bcl-2/BAX, p4E-BP1, pT389-S6K in
  granulosa cells between the CON, TM, TM+MEL, TM +si-NC, TM+si-ATF4, TM+si-ATF4+MEL
  group. (L–O) The protein levels of Grp78 and mTOR were determined using immunofluorescence.
  All the experiments were repeated for 3 times and all values are means ± SE. ∗P
  < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
