caption: Gene Ontology (GO) term and pathway enrichment for chemotherapy response
  related differentially enriched genes (DEGs). (A) Top 20 GO term cluster network
  enriched for chemotherapy response‐related DEGs. Each node represents a specific
  GO term, and links by an edge when similarity score >0.3. Nodes with the same color
  belong to the same cluster. Nodes with ellipse, round rectangle, and diamond shape
  represent enriched biological process, cellular components, and molecular function
  terms, respectively. The size of the nodes (big, small) correlates with gene counts
  in the enrichment, common, or majority common clusters between refractory‐related
  DEGs and resistance‐related DEGs are labeled in red and orange, respectively. Clusters
  specially enriched in refractory‐ or resistance‐related DEGs are labeled in blue
  or pink, respectively. (B) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways
  enriched for chemotherapy response‐related DEGs. Bubble color and size correlate
  with‐logP and counts respectively. (C) Canonical pathway hallmark gene sets enriched
  for chemotherapy response‐related DEGs
