figure_title: Interaction types that are not found in
caption: A shows a complex binding of SULT1A1, SULT1E1 and SULT2A1 that catalyzes
  cis-4-hydroxytamoxafin to trans-4-sulfoxytamoxifen with PAPS to PAP formation found
  in Tamoxifen Metabolism (wikipathways:WP691). B shows transcription translation
  interaction for BST2 to BST2 in Host-pathogen interaction of human corona virusesâ€”MAPK
  signaling pathway (wikipathways:WP4877).
