caption: Schematic diagram of the proposed molecular mechanism for negative regulation
  of MDR via GnT-III. In the present study, we found that GnT-III expression negatively
  regulates P-gp expression via a TNFR2-mediated NF-κB signal pathway. The K562 cells
  highly expressed GnT-III, and TNFα is required for the trimeric formation of TNFR2
  on the cell surface, which then subsequently induces NF-κB signaling for the upregulation
  of P-gp. By contrast, once the K562 cells get chemoresistance such as the K562/ADR
  cells, the expression levels of GnT-III are substantially suppressed. The deficiency
  of bisected N-glycans on TNFR2 strongly induces its autotrimerization and then activates
  NF-κB signaling for the upregulation of P-gp. Furthermore, the restoration of GnT-III
  in the K562/ADR cells impedes TNFR2 autotrimerization and suppresses NF-κB signaling
  for the regulation of P-gp expression, which is similar with the effects of BAY
  11-7082 as an NF-κB inhibitor to inhibit ubiquitination of IkBα. The present study
  could provide valuable direction for the development of a new therapy to reverse
  MDR and resensitize tumor cells to antineoplastic agents. The red arrows show the
  activation of NF-κB signaling, whiles black lines show the inhibition of NF-κB signaling.
