caption: Model illustrating the mechanism by which KMT2D and PPARγ interact to influence
  lipogenesis in PCa. In prostate cancer cells, PPARγ interacts and binds to the KMT2D
  after ligand activation. The complex then binds to the response element (PPRE sequence)
  of the PPARγ transcription factor to regulate the transcription of downstream genes.
  The completion of this process promotes the lipid metabolism pathway and affects
  the supply of energy for cell growth. KMT2D, kinase tethers histone-lysine N-methyltransferase
  2D; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma; PCa, prostate cancer;
  PPRE, peroxisome proliferator response element.
