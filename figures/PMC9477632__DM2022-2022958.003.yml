caption: 'THBS2 was related to increased calcic nodule formation and the expressions
  of factors associated with OD and ECM during the OD of VICs. (a) Calcic nodule formation
  of VICs during the process of OD was observed by Alizarin Red staining (scale: 200
  μm; magnification: ×100). (b) and (c) Relative mRNA expressions of osteocalcin,
  Runx2, SPARC, COL1A2, and COL1A1 (b) and SPP1, CTGF, MMP-2, and MMP-13 (c) in VICs
  during the process of OD were determined through qRT-PCR. GAPDH was a loading control.
  ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001 vs. control group. All experiments were repeated
  independently at least three times. Data were expressed as the means ± standard deviation.
  Abbreviations: THBS2: thrombospondin 2; OD: osteogenic differentiation; ECM: extracellular
  matrix; VICs: valve interstitial cells; Runx2: Runt-related transcription factor-2;
  SPARC: secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine; COL1A: collagen type I alpha;
  SPP1: secreted phosphoprotein 1; CTGF: connective tissue growth factor; MMP-: matrix
  metalloproteinase-; qRT-PCR: quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain
  reaction; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.'
