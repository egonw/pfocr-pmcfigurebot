caption: The effect of Siglec-15 on the glycolytic pathway of RAW264.7 macrophages.
  (a) Bone marrow cells from wild-type and Siglec-15 knockout mice were extracted
  in vitro and induced into bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). The effect of
  IL-4 stimulation on ECAR of BMDMs cells. (B) The effect of IL-4 stimulation on the
  ECAR of BMDMs cells. (c) The effect of IL-4 stimulation on the lactic acid production
  of BMDMs cells. (d) The effect of IL-4 stimulation on HK enzyme activity. (e) The
  effect of Siglec-15 knockout of RAW264.7 and BMDMs on the transcription level of
  glycolysis-related genes.
