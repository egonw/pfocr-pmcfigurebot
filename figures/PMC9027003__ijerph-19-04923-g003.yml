caption: The metabolic pathways comparison of 20 °C anaerobic and aerobic storage
  modes for 20 days. (Each circle represents a metabolic pathway; the horizontal coordinate
  represents the impact value of that pathway, and the vertical coordinate represents
  the result of the enrichment analysis. The color of the circles changes from white
  to dark red as the −log(p) value increases, and the size of the circles is shown
  visually as the impact value increases from small to large, Impact > 0.05.).
