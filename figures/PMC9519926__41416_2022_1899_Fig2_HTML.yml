figure_title: FGF receptor inhibition re-sensitises A2780DPP cells to cisplatin and
  carboplatin
caption: Immunoblot analysis was used to assess blockade of the FGF signalling pathway
  in A2780DPP cells in response to a AZD4547 (0–10 µM) and b SU5402 (0–10 µM). MTT
  assays were used to investigate the viability of A2780DPP cells following co-treatment
  with 10 µM AZD4547 or 10 µM SU5402 and c, d cisplatin (0–25.33 µM) and e, f carboplatin
  (0–85.12 µM). Results represent three independent experiments. Pairwise comparisons
  of mean IC50 values were calculated by Student’s t-tests. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001. Ns not significant.
