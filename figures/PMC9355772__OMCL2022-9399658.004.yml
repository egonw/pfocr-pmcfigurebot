caption: 'CHR activated the Wnt3a/β-catenin signaling pathway by downregulating miR-320-5p
  in hemin-induced HT22 cell injury models. (a) Potential binding site of miR-320-5p
  at the 3′-UTR of Wnt3a mRNA is predicted using the miRWalk software. The red color
  indicates wild-type, and the green color indicates the mutated sequence of Wnt3a
  at the miR-320-5p-binding site. (b) HT22 cells were cotransfected with miR-320-5p
  (or NC mimics) and a pmir-GLO vector containing wild-type or mutated miR-320-5p-binding
  sites (mutated) at Wnt3a 3′-UTR. Luciferase reporter assays were performed 24 h
  after cotransfection. NC mim.: negative control mimics; miR mim.: miR-320-5p mimics;
  NC inh.: negative control inhibitor; miR inh.: miR-320-5p inhibitor. N.S.p > 0.05,
  ∗∗∗p < 0.001. N = 6. (c) HT22 cells were transfected with the miR-320-5p inhibitor
  or miR-320-5p mimics and their corresponding controls. The expression of miR-320-5p
  and Wnt3a mRNA was analyzed using the RT-PCR technique. ∗∗∗p < 0.001. N = 3. (d
  and e) Expression levels of mRNA and protein of Wnt3a were analyzed in hemin-induced
  HT22 cells with or without CHR (10 μM; treatment time: 24 h) using the RT-PCR and
  western blot. ∗∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗∗p < 0.001. N = 3. (f) Expression of miR-320-5p was
  analyzed in hemin-induced HT22 cells in the presence and absence of CHR (10 μM;
  treatment time: 24 h) or miR-320-5p mimics (treatment time: 24 h) using the RT-PCR
  technique. ∗∗∗p < 0.001. N = 3. (g) The mRNA expression of Wnt3a was analyzed in
  hemin-induced HT22 cells with or without CHR (10 μM; treatment time: 24 h) or miR-320-5p
  mimics (treatment time: 24 h) using the RT-PCR technique. ∗∗∗p < 0.001. N = 3. (h)
  The protein expression levels of Wnt3a, total β-catenin (T-β-catenin), and nuclear
  β-catenin (N-β-catenin) were analyzed in hemin-induced HT22 cells with or without
  CHR (10 μM; treatment time: 24 h) or miR-320-5p mimics (treatment time: 24 h) using
  the western blot technique. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001. N = 3.'
