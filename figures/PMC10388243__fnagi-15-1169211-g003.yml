caption: Oxidative stress affects MAPKs in ARPE-19 cells. (A) Western blot results
  show ARPE-19 cells treated with H2O2 for 6 h. Total and phosphorylated P38MAPK,
  ERK, and JNK were detected. (B) Quantitative analysis of western blot results from
  three independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, compared to control.
