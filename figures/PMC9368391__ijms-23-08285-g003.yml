caption: 'Schematic diagram of innate immune response induced by coronavirus RNA.
  Viral dsRNA is sensed by TLR3 in endosomes, triggering the innate immune response,
  while ssRNA in endosomes is sensed by TLR7/8 and induces the production of inflammatory
  cytokines through the MyD88-TAK1-IKK-NF-κB signaling pathway. Viral dsRNA is recognized
  by MDA5 and NOD1, and then interacts with MAVS on mitochondria, which further activates
  the NF-κB and IRFs signaling pathways. Viral GU-rich ssRNA is sensed by TLR8, causing
  the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes through the Caspase-8-RIPK1 signaling pathway,
  leading to the secretion of mature IL-1β and IL-18. Importantly, it is not clear
  whether viral dsRNA is recognized by RIG-I to initiate IFN response or whether viral
  RNA induces inflammasome formation; thus, the associated pathway is indicated by
  dotted lines. Abbreviation: RIPK, Receptor interacting protein kinase; other abbreviations
  are shown in the legend to .'
