caption: Schematic diagram of signaling cascade for activation of cofilin in pancreatic
  acinar cells. In rat pancreatic acinar cells, maximal activation of cofilin by cholecystokinin
  (CCK)-8 requires activation of PKC, which mediates both Src family of kinase (SFK)
  and protein kinase D (PKD) activation resulting in PAK4 activation; requires activation
  of ROCK, which is mediated by Rho; requires activation of JNK, mediated by activation
  of this MAPK pathway; and requires activation of serine protein phosphatases (PP2A),
  which are a substrate of PKC. Cofilin activation is important for CCK-stimulated
  enzyme secretion as well as ERK1/2 activation which has been shown to mediate growth.
  Squares represent signaling pathways shown to be involved in cofilin activation
  in this study.
