caption: 'CPNW response to translational sequences: In all figures, (A–H) a frame
  (80 × 80) of a translational sequence and its corresponding response on CPNW is
  displayed. The numbers 0, 45, 90 etc., represent the direction of motion of the
  input sequence. CPNW consists of eight cell-planes, each shows maximum response
  to specific translational motion direction as result of training. The amount of
  activity produced by cell-plane neurons can be estimated using color bars. One can
  also observe that, though only one cell-plane produces highest activity in response
  to given motion direction (e.g., 0°), the cell-plane that encode opposite motion
  direction (180°) produce relatively high activity compared to the cell-planes that
  encode other motion directions.'
