caption: (I) Quantification of the expression levels of proteins involved with cardiac
  fatty acids translocation and intracellular transport, and β‐oxidation. CD36, fatty
  acid (FA) translocase (A); FA‐binding protein, FABP3 (B); carnitine palmitoyltransferase
  1, CPT1β (C); acetyl‐CoA dehydrogenase, ACADL (D); medium‐chain acyl‐CoA dehydrogenase,
  MCAD (E); 2,4‐dienoyl‐CoA reductase, DECR1 (F). (II) Quantification of the expression
  levels of metabolic sensors and transcriptional effectors. AMP‐activated protein
  kinase, AMPK (A); phosphorylated AMPK, pAMPK (B); sirtuin 1, SIRT1 (C); peroxisome
  proliferator activated receptor‐α, PPARα (D); receptor X retinoid, RXR (E); peroxisome
  proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α, PGC1α (F). AS, untrained aortic
  stenosis; AST, trained aortic stenosis; ShamT, trained Sham. Data are mean ± SD;
  Kruskal–Wallis and anova; *p < 0.05. **p < 0.001. (n = 6–8 each group).
