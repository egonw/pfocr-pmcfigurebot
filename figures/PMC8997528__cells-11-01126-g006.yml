caption: 'DNA methylation and open chromatin regions in PDLCs with distinct osteogenic
  potential after osteogenic stimulation. The comparison of l- and h-PDLCs at epigenetic
  levels (DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility) was performed between data
  sets obtained after 10 days of cell culture in OM media. (A) Proportion of 14,194
  differentially methylated probes, either hypo- or hyper-methylated in l-PDLCs as
  compared to h-PDLCs. (B) The top 16 biological processes related to genes hypermethylated
  in l-PDLCs. (C) Gene expression changes related to ‘Bone development’ process highlighted
  in (B), extracted from the RNA-seq data as Log2FoldChange. (D,E) Open chromatin
  regions identified by ATAC-seq after osteogenic stimulation were linked to the closest
  gene, and the gene lists were analysed for pathway enrichment. The analysis was
  performed using GO Biological Processes and the top 15 terms are shown for l-PDLCs
  (LOM) (D) and h-PDLCs (HOM) (E). (F,G) Differential gene expression levels between
  l- and h-PDLCs at day 10 of osteogenic stimulation, extracted from the RNA-seq data
  as Log2FoldChange for genes associated with ‘Response to unfolded protein’ (F) and
  ‘Osteoblast differentiation’ (G). Orange: genes upregulated in h-PDLCs; blue: genes
  upregulated in l-PDLCs. LOM, periodontal ligament cells with low osteogenic potential
  at day 10 day of osteogenic stimulation in vitro; HOM, periodontal ligament cells
  with high osteogenic potential at day 10 day of osteogenic stimulation in vitro.'
