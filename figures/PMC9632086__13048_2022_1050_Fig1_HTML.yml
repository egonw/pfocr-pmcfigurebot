caption: Clinicopathologic characteristics of PDE10A expression in ovarian cancer.
  A Kaplan-Meyer overall survival analysis of TCGA ovarian cystadenocarcinoma patients
  stratified by PDE10A mRNA expression levels. PDE10Ahigh and PDE10Alow correspond
  to mRNA expression 2x higher (n = 16) and 2 × lower (n = 154) than mean PDE10A mRNA
  levels in the population, respectively; PDE10Amedium, remainder patients (n = 132).
  B PDE10A protein levels in ovarian cancer cell lines and normal ovarian surface
  epithelial (OSE) cells measured by western-blotting. GAPDH was used as the loading
  control. HOSEpic are primary OSE cells, while IOSE-80 and IOSE-7576 are immortalized
  OSE cell lines. C Comparison of PDE10A expression in normal ovary tissue (from GTEx
  database; n = 88) and ovarian cancer (from TCGA; n = 426) using GEPIA. D PDE10A
  mRNA levels measured by qPCR in ovary tumor (n = 59) and normal ovary (n = 14) clinical
  specimens deposited at our institutional Biobank. Relative expression was calculated
  with the ΔCt method using GPS1 as housekeeping gene. Error bars, ± SD, **p < 0.01
  (Unpaired two-tailed students t-test). E PDE10A mRNA expression in normal human
  tissue from the GTEx Portal (top 16 tissues included). F–H iPathway Guide impact
  analysis of genes differentially expressed when comparing TCGA ovarian tumors with
  PDE10AHIGHvs. PDE10ALOW mRNA levels. In this comparison, 1,510 differentially expressed
  (DE) genes were identified out of a total of 19,331 genes with measured expression
  using thresholds of log2-fold change ± 0.6 and adjusted p-value < 0.1. F Each pathway
  is represented as a single dot, with significant pathways shown in red and yellow,
  and non-significant in black. G Hub genes and interactions for the Pathways in Cancer
  pathway. Genes with elevated mRNA expression depicted in red and genes with decreased
  mRNA expression depicted in blue. H Log2-fold change for the Pathways in Cancer
