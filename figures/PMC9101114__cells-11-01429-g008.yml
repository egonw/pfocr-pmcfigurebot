caption: Schematic showing differential responses in the control and Alzheimer’s disease
  iPSC-derived astrocytes. (a) Astrocytes generated from Alzheimer’s disease (sAD
  and fAD) show increased glutamate-induced calcium transients in terms of amplitude
  and duration when compared to healthy astrocytes (NDC). (b) Extracellular free tau,
  which is neurotoxic, is taken up by astrocytes via heparin sulphate proteoglycan
  (HSPG), a process mitigated by heparin. Upon tau exposure, only AD astrocytes exhibit
  GFAP upregulation and morphological reshaping, attributes of reactive state. Tau
  is processed in the endo-lysosomal compartment (c) and degraded (d). Meanwhile,
  the uptake of tau activates ERK pathway with highest levels of pERK, EAAT-2 and
  pPKC in sporadic AD-derived astrocytes (sAD), leading to the upregulation of astrocytic
  pro-MMP-2 and MMP-9 (e), which results in differential activation and secretion
  (f). The capacity to degrade and attenuate extracellular tau was the highest when
  using the secretome of sAD and NDC astrocytes compared to fAD, and showed a neuroprotective
  effect accompanied by an increase in the levels of neuronal NMDA, GAP43 and drebrin.
