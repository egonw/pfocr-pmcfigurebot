caption: 'Tryptophan metabolism in M1-Mɸ versus M2-Mɸs.A, concentrations of tryptophan
  pathway metabolites in M0-, M1-, and M2-MФs measured by LC-MS. Concentrations were
  calculated by normalizing the signals of targeting compounds against the signal
  of 10 μl of 0.1 mM 13C2, 2,2-2H2, 15N-Glycine spiked in 200 μl of acetone extracts.
  B, tryptophan pathway showing metabolites framed in red or green colors indicating
  an increase in either M1-MФs or M2. IDO: indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, TPH: tryptophan
  hydroxylase, KMO, kynurenine 3-monooxygenase; KYNU, kynureninase; QPRT, quinolinate
  phosphoribosyltransferase. C, heat map of the expressions of proteins identified
  in the tryptophan pathway.'
