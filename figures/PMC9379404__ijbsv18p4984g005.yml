caption: Functional enrichment for the Risckscore. (A) Immunohistochemistry data of
  the three model gene proteins in the HPA database. The three proteins exhibited
  up-regulated expression in lung cancer; (B-D) Correlation between the expression
  and methylation levels of PRC1 (B), MRPL51 (C), SLK (D); (E) CNV of the three model
  genes. Deletion was much more frequent in SLK and PRC1 genes while amplification
  was more frequent in MRPL51 gene; (F-G) Metascape functional enrichment analysis.
  The genes up-regulated in the high-risk group were mainly involved in cell cycle
  and DNA replication (Left), while the genes up-regulated in the low-risk group were
  mainly associated with antigen-presenting and immune response (Right); (H-I) GSEA
  enrichment analysis. High Riskcore was mainly involved in cell cycle and p53 signaling
  pathway (H), while low riskscore was majorly enriched in immune function-related
  pathways, such as asthma, autoimmune, hematopoiesis, autoimmune thyroid diseases
  (I).
