caption: Mechanism of cornuside in improving the cognitive function of the 3 × Tg-AD
  mice. In the 3 × Tg-AD mice, cornuside regulates the phenotypic conversion of astrocytes,
  enhances synaptic plasticity, inhibits neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, and
  ameliorates deficient cognition through the AKT/Nrf2/NF-κB signaling pathway.
