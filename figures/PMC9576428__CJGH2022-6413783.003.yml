caption: Activation of ER stress induces CTLs depletion. (a) CTTL-2 cells were cocultured
  with Hepa1-6 cells for one day. Different concentrations of TM (0, 1, 2, and 4 μM)
  were added to CTTL-2 cells and cultured for 1 day. Western blotting analysis was
  used to determine GRP78 levels. (b) Cells were treated with TM (0 and 4 μM), and
  changes in ER morphology were analyzed by electron microscopy (scale bar = 2 μm).
  (c) CTTL-2 cells were cocultured with Hepa1-6 cells for one day. Different concentrations
  of 4-PBA (0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 mM) were added to CTTL-2 cells and cultured for one
  day. The expression of GRP78 was analyzed by western blotting. (d) Cells were treated
  with 4-PBA (0 and 0.4 mM), and ER morphology was examined by electron microscopy.
  (e) CTLL-2 cells were treated with TM, and western blotting was used to analyze
  PD-1 and TIM-3 expression. (f) ELISA analysis of PRF1 and GzmB expression. (g) CTLL-2
  cells were treated with 4-PBA, and PD-1 and TIM-3 expression levels were measured
  by western blotting. (h) ELISA was used to detect the expression of PRF1 and GzmB.
  Data are presented as the mean ± SD. ∗∗∗P < 0.001, ns indicates no statistical significance.
