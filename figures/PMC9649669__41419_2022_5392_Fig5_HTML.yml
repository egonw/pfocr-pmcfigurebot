caption: 'A Relative mRNA expression levels of REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ across eight
  prostate cell lines; n = 3; means ± SDs; ANOVA. B qPCR of REV-ERBα knockdown validation
  in PC3 and 22RV1 cells using 3 siRNAs; n = 4; means ± SDs; ANOVA. C Western blot
  validation of REV-ERBα knockdown in PC3 and 22RV1 cells using 3 siRNAs. D, E CCK-8
  assay showed that knockdown of REV-ERBα could not rescue SR9009-induced cytotoxicity
  in PC3 (D; n = 4; means ± SDs; unpaired t test) and 22RV1 (E; n = 6; means ± SDs;
  unpaired t test) cells. F, G qPCR (F; n = 4; means ± SDs; ANOVA) and Western blot
  (G) of REV-ERBβ knockdown validation in PC3 and 22RV1 cells using 3 siRNAs. H, I
  CCK-8 assay showed that knockdown of REV-ERBβ could not rescue SR9009-induced cytotoxicity
  in PC3 (H; n = 4; means ± SDs; unpaired t test) and 22RV1 (I; n = 6; means ± SDs;
  unpaired t test) cells. J Western blot of REV-ERB knockdown validation in 22RV1
  cells. K, L CCK-8 assay showed that knockdown of REV-ERBs could not rescue SR9009-induced
  cytotoxicity in PC3 (K; n = 4; means ± SDs; unpaired t test) and 22RV1 (L; n = 6;
  means ± SDs; unpaired t test) cells. M Western blot validation of REV-ERB protein
  levels through CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in PC3 and 22RV1 cells. N-O: PC3 (N, n = 8
  means ± SDs; ANOVA) and 22RV1 (O, n = 8 means ± SDs; ANOVA)-REV-ERB knockout cells
  were treated with SR9009 (20 μM) or DMSO for 3 days. ns, not significant; *p < 0.05;
  **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001.'
