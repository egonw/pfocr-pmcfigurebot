caption: LOCI-1 enables light-dependent control of gene expression through the Ca2+-dependent
  NFAT pathway in T lymphocytes. (A) Dose-inhibition analysis of native CRAC current
  by LOCI-1 in Jurkat cells. Ki = 22.7 ± 1.7 μM, n = 5. (B, Left) Time course of CRAC
  current in Jurkat T cells following addition of 20 mM Ca2+ with and without 100
  μM LOCI-1 and during periodic illumination of 360 nm and 520 nm light, as indicated.
  (B, Right) I-V plots of currents before and after application of 100 μM LOCI-1 in
  the dark and under illumination with 360 nm light, as indicated by asterisk. (C)
  Time course of intracellular Ca2+ traces in individual Jurkat T cells. Cells were
  loaded with the Ca2+ indicator Cal-590, incubated with TG (1 μM) and 100 μM of either
  LOCI-1 or 2-APB and briefly exposed to 360 nm light at the indicated time points.
  (D) Scheme for Ca2+–calcineurin–NFAT signaling pathway in T lymphocytes. (E) NFAT-dependent
  gene expression experiment in JNL cells. Cells were stimulated with PMA (10 ng/mL)
  and Tg (1 μM) and incubated for 16 h in the presence of vehicle (DMSO) or LOCI-1
  (100 μM). Cells were kept in the dark (dash) or exposed to a brief 10-s illumination
  of 365 nm light at time points 0, 30, and 60 min (purple star), as indicated. NFAT
  transcriptional activity was determined with a luminescence-based assay ().
