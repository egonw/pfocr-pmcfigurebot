caption: Computational lineage modeling analysis for the reprogramming trajectory
  for the interdental cell (IdC) cluster. (A) Subclustering of the interdental cells
  (IdC) showing distinct accumulation of control (red) and the surrounding Dox-induced
  sample-derived IdC cells (light blue). (B) Construction of a pseudotime trajectory
  of the IdC subcluster from control to Dox-treated samples, with the black line showing
  the path of pseudotime, and UMAP plots are colored according to pseudotime. (C)
  Expression changes of the co-regulated genes within each module generated by Monocle3
  analysis. The modules are consisted of genes clustered according to the correlation
  of expression levels. (D) Gene ontology analysis of Module 4 by DAVID using the
  genes whose expression changed significantly over pseudotime. The GO terms with
  p value less than 0.05 were considered significantly enriched by the query genes.
  (E) Kinetic plots showing the relative expression profiles of ten representative
  genes associated with Response to cAMP or Wnt Signaling Pathway over the pseudotime.
  (F) A functional interaction network of the key genes from the Response to cAMP
  and Wnt signaling pathways. The nodes represent proteins, and the colored lines
  represent interactions between proteins. Presence of the more lines denotes a greater
  degree of connection.
