caption: 'Associations among dietary diversity, features of the gut environment, and
  host circulating metabolites in Guangzhou Nutrition and Health Study participants.
  (A) Associations of the stable DDS and DDS-related gut environment features with
  host circulating metabolites within the WGCNA red module. (B, C) Relations between
  the stable DDS, scores on gut environment features, and secondary bile acids according
  to bidirectional mediation analysis (n = 306). (D) Cross-sectional associations
  between secondary bile acids and glycemic and inflammatory phenotypes. (A) We used
  linear regression models to investigate the associations of the stable DDS (n = 306)
  and DDS-related gut environment features (n = 933) with host circulating metabolites.
  (B, C) We separately calculated the DFS and DMS. Bidirectional mediation analysis
  was conducted with the “RMediation” package in R. At each edge, the β coefficient
  and P value labels between the 2 points were determined via linear regression. The
  proportions and P values of indirect effects are labeled at the center of the triangle
  charts. (D) We adjusted for age and sex in the Spearman correlation analysis of
  bile acids and phenotypes. (D) n = 957 participants; among them, 81 had type 2 diabetes,
  51 were prediabetic. *P < 0.05 and FDR < 0.25; #P < 0.05 and FDR > 0.25. ARGININE-SYN4-PWY,
