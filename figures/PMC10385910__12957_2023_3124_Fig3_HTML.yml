caption: 'The AKT inhibitor LY294002 rescued the function of TRIM58 in LOVO cells.
  LOVO cells were transduced with TRIM58 shRNA and treated with LY294002. A Cell viability
  was measured using CCK-8 assay. B, C Cell cycle was measured through flow cytometry.
  D Protein levels of AKT, p-AKT, p21, and cyclin D1 were measured through Western
  blotting. ***p < 0.001 vs. shNC + Vehicle. ###p < 0.001 vs. shTRIM58 + Vehicle'
article_title: TRIM58 functions as a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer by promoting
  RECQL4 ubiquitination to inhibit the AKT signaling pathway.
