caption: 'Regulatory mechanism of the transcriptional factor FtcR on biofilm formation
  during hyperosmotic stress: Under hyperosmotic stress, the transcriptional factor
  FtcR plays an essential role in autoregulating its expression and the osmotic-stress-response
  regulator by directly binding to the conserved TGTGGGCA motif upstream of betI,
  which is involved in controlling B. melitensis 16M biofilm formation when challenged
  by osmotic stress. However this process is independent of its flagellar target gene,
  fliF.'
