caption: 'GFI1 regulated EHT process through activating PI3K signalling. (A) Work
  flow of the GFI1 gene binding analysis: Generating a GFI1‐flag‐knock in hES cell
  line using CRISPR‐Cas9 technology, and then sorting endothelial cells during hESCs
  blood differentiation by FACS, finally analysing its direct chromatin‐binding through
  CUT&tag (B) Distribution of the GFI1 binding peaks in the genomic regions detected
  by Cut&tag. (C) Top KEGG terms enriched of GFI1 binding genes. (D) Cut&tag and ATAC‐seq
  tracks of PI3K‐Akt signalling pathway associated genes. (E) Experimental design
  to analyse the influence of PI3K inhibition on HPC generation. The canonical PI3K
  inhibitor—LY294002 was added from day4 to day8 during haematopoietic differentiation.
  (F) FACS analysis of the CD43+ HPC generation from the indicated group at day 8
  of the haematopoietic differentiation. Statistics was determined using unpaired
  two‐tailed Student''s t‐tests, **p < .01. The data represent mean ± SD from three
  independent replicates (n = 3)'
