caption: 'Characterization of the exosomal proteome from distinct biofluids. Exosomal
  proteomes associated molecular functions (a), biological processes (b) and pathways
  (c) analysis. Gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed for gene lists corresponding
  to the exosomal proteomes from serum, plasma and CSF, through the Panther classification
  system. Exclusive GO terms for exosomes isolated from only one biofluid or shared
  only by exosomes from two biofluids were represented below the dashed lines. Abbreviations
  of molecular function GOs terms: GO:0005488 binding; GO:0003824 catalytic activity;
  GO:0005198 structural molecule activity; GO:0098772 molecular function regulator;
