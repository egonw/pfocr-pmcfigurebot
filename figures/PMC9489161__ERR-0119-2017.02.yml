caption: 'Inflammatory responses elicited by e-liquid vaping. E-liquid vaping results
  in recruitment of immune cells to the site of exposure, i.e. nasal and throat epithelial
  cells. Tissue macrophages are among the first lines of defence activated by exposure
  to e-cigarette vapours. Activated macrophages participate in phagocytosis and release
  pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-1β, etc. a) In
  turn, these cytokines lead to B-cell and T-cell differentiation and participate
  in downstream signalling mechanisms. b) IL-6 mediated activation of the JAK–STAT
  (Janus tyrosine kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway
  is one such downstream pathway that is known to be activated by the action of e-vapours.
  IL-6 production by exposure to e-vapours causes STAT3 phosphorylation which further
  elicits production of other cytokines and chemokines, and, most importantly promotes
  neutrophil adhesion and migration into the lungs. c) Neutrophil migration into the
  tissue results in release of neutrophil elastase and matrix metallopeptidase-9,
  which in turn causes tissue destruction in emphysematous lungs and chronic obstructive
  pulmonary disease. d) Furthermore, neutrophils release various cytokines and chemokines
  such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-10 and IL-1β, which activate p38 and
  nuclear factor (NF)-кB mediated signalling pathways that might result in inflammation
  or apoptosis. e) Exposure to e-vapours further results in release of β-defensins
  by epithelial cells. β-defensins have antimicrobial actions and participate in eliciting
  an inflammatory response; however, production of the SPLUNC1 (short palate, lung
  and nasal epithelium clone 1) protein known to induce innate immunity in airway
  epithelial cells is lowered on exposure to e-vapours. ICAM: intercellular adhesion
  molecule.'
