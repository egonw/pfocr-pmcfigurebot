caption: Cacumen Platycladi and quercetin inhibit the NLRP3 signaling pathway in the
  gut. A model of the protective effect of Cacumen Platycladi and quercetin in LPS-induced
  cell inflammation and pyroptosis was hypothesized. LPS results in inflammation and
  pyroptosis in the intestine of mice. Quercetin found in food and traditional Chinese
  medicine reduces caspase-1, ASC, and GSDMD by downregulating the TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3
  pathway, and reduces the recruitment of IL-18, IL-1β, and other inflammatory factors.
  In addition, it upregulates the tight junction protein ZO-1 to enhance the barrier
  function of the intestinal tract. Thus, quercetin protects against LPS-induced cell
  pyroptosis and death through this mechanism.
article_title: Quercetin effectively improves LPS-induced intestinal inflammation,
  pyroptosis, and disruption of the barrier function through the TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3
  signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro.
