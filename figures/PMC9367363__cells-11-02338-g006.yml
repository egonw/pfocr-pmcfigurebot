caption: Analysis of MAPK signaling pathway—plant and plant hormone signal transduction
  in terms of DEGs. Red dotted box represents analysis of MAPK signaling pathway in
  terms of DEGs. Green dotted box represents analysis of plant hormone signal transduction
  in terms of DEGs. Genes in red line frame represent DEGs. The dots on the left represent
  the CK2–CK1 comparison group, and those on the right represent the T–CK2 comparison
  group. The color scale ranges from −3 to 4, with blue indicating down-regulation
  and red indicating up-regulation (see the color set scale). CK1 represents watermelon
  seedlings cultured in normal Hoagland solution; CK2 represents watermelon seedlings
  cultured in Hoagland solution containing 150 mM NaCl, and T represents watermelon
  seedlings cultured in Hoagland solution containing 150 mM NaCl and 20 mM trehalose.
