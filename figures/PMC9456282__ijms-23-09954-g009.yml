caption: 'Schematic diagram showing how caffeine affects the NASH experimental model.
  Caffeine attenuates the experimental NASH progression possibly by modulating the
  nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)
  signaling pathways, thereby reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, respectively.
  Caffeine also attenuates fibrosis progression by modulating mitogen-activated protein
  kinases (MAPK) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathways, thereby
  decreasing the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Caffeine inhibits inflammasome
  activation by blocking the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway.
  ROS: reactive oxygen species; DAMPs: damage-associated molecular patterns; α-SMA:
  smooth muscle alpha-actin; IL: interleukin; TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor-alpha.'
