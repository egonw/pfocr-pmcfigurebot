caption: 'AIMP1 regulates MM cell proliferation via modulation of the MAPK signaling
  pathway. (A) Venn diagrams of co‐upregulated genes in two AIMP1‐OE MM cell lines
  and two AIMP1 protein‐treated MM cell lines compared with AIMP1‐WT cells. (B) KEGG
  pathway analysis of the RNA‐seq data indicated that AIMP1 was associated with the
  MAPK signaling pathway and osteoclast differentiation. (C) WB analysis of p‐ERK1/2
  and ERK1/2 expressions in AIMP1‐OE and AIMP1‐KD cells. (D) Quantitative analysis
  of p‐ERK1/2 and ERK1/2 protein expressions in AIMP1‐OE and AIMP1‐KD cells compared
  with the AIMP1‐WT cells (n = 3). (E) AIMP1 protein activated p‐ERK1/2 expression
  in MM cells after treated for 2 h. (F) Quantitative analysis of p‐ERK1/2 and ERK1/2
  protein expressions in AIMP1 protein‐treated cells compared with AIMP1‐WT cells
  (n = 3). Data are presented as the mean ± SD; *P < 0.05; P < 0.001. Abbreviations:
  AIMP1: Aminoacyl‐tRNA synthetase‐interacting multifunctional protein 1; MM: Multiple
  myeloma; OE: Overexpression; WT: Wild type; KD: Knockdown; KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of genes and genes; RNA‐seq: RNA sequencing; MAPK: mitogen‐activated protein kinase;
  WB: Western blotting; p‐ERK1/2: Phosphorylated extracellular‐regulated kinase 1/2;
  ERK1/2: Extracellular‐regulated kinase 1/2'
