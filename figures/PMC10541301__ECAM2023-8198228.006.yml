caption: 'Synergistic anti-inflammatory signaling effect of extracts from Chrysanthemum
  zawadskii flower and Cudrania tricuspidata fruit. RAW 264.7 cells were treated with
  0.1 μg/ml of CT fruit extract and 5 μg/ml of CZ flower extracts alone or cotreated
  with both extracts. Cells were stimulated with 0.1 μg/ml of LPS for 30 min (a, b)
  or the indicate time (c). (a) The nuclear translocation of NF-κB subunit p65 was
  assessed using immunofluorescence. (b) Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI, and
  positive staining for p65 was quantified and graphed. Scale bar, 10 μm. (c) The
  expression levels of protein were analyzed by Western blot analysis using anti-IκBα
  antibodies. β-Actin was detected as a control. The expression of IκBα was quantified
  and presented graphically. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. control. ##P < 0.01 vs. LPS treatment.'
