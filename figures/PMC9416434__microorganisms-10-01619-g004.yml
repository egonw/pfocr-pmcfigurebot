caption: Colonization of different polymers by Exiguobacterium sp. RIT 594. The surfaces
  of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) (a–d) and of PS (e–h), were recorded following
  60 days of shaking in minimal medium (LCFBM) lacking a carbon source other than
  the polymer. (a) Control without bacterial inoculation (4980× resolution, scale
  bar 10 μm); (b–d) colonized HDPE by Exiguobacterium sp. RIT 594. (b) Colonies of
  the bacterium at 1760× resolution and scale bar at 20 μm (white arrow); (c,d) represent
  snapshots of (b) at magnifications of 11,200 and 20,300×, and scale bars at 5 and
  2 μm, respectively. The typical short, rounded morphology is highlighted with thinner
  white arrows, and the elongated rods with thicker white arrows. The cell shape is
  possibly elongated due to the inability to use HDPE as a carbon source (starvation
  response; see text for details). (e) Control without bacterial inoculation (5000×
  resolution, scale bar 10 μm), 60 days shaking in minimal medium (LCFBM), and (f–h)
  colonized by Exiguobacterium sp. RIT 594. (f) Colonies of the bacterium at 1400×
  resolution and scale bar at 20 μm (white arrow). (g) Further magnification of (f)
  reveals that the cells are associated with nanoscale fibers and particles (thinner
  white arrows) and cell elongation (thicker white arrows); 13,700× resolution, scale
  bar 2 μm. (h) Multiple cells adhere to a cell with a single long projection (thicker
  white arrow), which is associated with nanoscale fibers and particles (thinner white
  arrows; 29,500× resolution, scale bar 2 μm).
