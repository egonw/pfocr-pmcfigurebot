caption: Differential gene analysis involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids pathway
  caused by mutant SHP2 expression. (A) Venn diagram indicating the overlap dysregulated
  genes in the biosynthesis of amino acids pathway in HCD-57 vs SHP2-D61Y and HCD-57
  vs SHP2-E76K. (B) Heatmap of 13 DEGs shared in both comparisons in the biosynthesis
  of amino acids metabolites pathway.
