figure_title: Partial uncoupling of glycolysis and TCA supports biosynthesis pathways
  (PPP, HBP) while FAO increases to sustain TCA
caption: (A) Liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry-based metabolomic
  analysis is performed for polar metabolites extracted from D3 to D6 for 4 independent
  replicates. Metabolic network is drawn for glycolysis, Kreb’s cycle, PPP, and HBP
  by comparing their metabolite levels across D3 to D6. Fold changes are plotted as
  heatmaps along each metabolite in the pathway with respect to D3. Scale bar ranges
  from blue to red corresponding to metabolite change from ‒5 to +5 fold. (B) Schematic
  depicting study design for pulse-chase labelling of uniformly 13C labeled glucose
  in glycolysis and TCA metabolites at D0, D5, and D6 using NMR. (C) NMR-based quantitation
  of [U-13C]-glucose incorporation in glycolysis and TCA metabolites at D5 and D6
  with respect to D0. Mean ± SEM is plotted for 3 independent replicates. Two-way
  ANOVA is applied, time factor, F(1.667,33.33) = 33.95, p-value < 0.0001. Dunnett’s
  test is performed for pairwise analysis. ***p-Value < 0.005, **p-value < 0.01, *p-value
  < 0.05. ns is not significant. (D) Schematic depicting study design for pulse-chase
  labelling of uniformly 13C labeled palmitate in TCA metabolites at D5 and D6 with
  respect to D0 using NMR. (E) NMR-based quantitation of [U-13C]-palmitate incorporation
  in TCA metabolites at D5 and D6. Mean ± SEM is plotted for 3 independent replicates.
  Two-way ANOVA is applied, time factor, F(2,12) = 19.91, p-value < 0.0002. Dunnett’s
  test is performed for pairwise analysis. ***p-Value < 0.005, **p-value < 0.01, *p-value
  < 0.05. ns is not significant. Quantitative data are provided in  for Panels C and
  E. Quantitative data for Panel A are provided in . FAO, fatty acid oxidation; HBP,
  hexosamine biosynthesis pathway; NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance; PPP, pentose phosphate
  pathway; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle.
