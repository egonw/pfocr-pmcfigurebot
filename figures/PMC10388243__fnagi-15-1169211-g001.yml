caption: H2O2-induced oxidative damage in ARPE-19 cells. (A) Representative photomicrographs
  of ARPE-19 cells after application of 0, 100, 300, and 500 μM H2O2 for 6 h. Scale
  bar = 50 μm. (B) ARPE-19 cell viability was measured using an MTT assay, n = 12.
  (C) Flow cytometry results from the same experiment presented in panel (A). (D)
  Quantification of cell death of sample shown in panel (C), n = 3. (E) Flow cytometry
  was used to estimate ROS production in ARPE-19 cells using staining with DCFDA.
  (F) Bar graphs representing relative fluorescence densities of DCF, which was transformed
  from DCFDA by the ROS production shown in panel (E). All data are means ± SD, *P
  < 0.05, **P < 0.01, compared to the control.
