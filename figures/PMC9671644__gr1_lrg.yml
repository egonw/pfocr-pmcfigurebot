caption: Proposed mechanism for the spread of the monkeypox virus throughout the body
  and its relation to the transmission routeThe clinical presentation of monkeypox
  might be influenced by microorganism virulence factors, host immunity, and the transmission
  route. Unlike in previous outbreaks, the monkeypox virus in the 2022 outbreak is
  thought to spread through close contact or sexual contact, causing predominantly
  localised lesions instead of extensive disseminated lesions. It is possible that
  the localised nature of the disease results in lower concentrations of viraemia
  and, consequently, less virus in respiratory excretions. As the respiratory route
  becomes less important, transmission continues to occur through direct contact via
  dermal inoculation, perpetuating the cycle of clinical presentation and transmission.
  Nevertheless, the monkeypox virus in previous outbreaks, mainly from the Democratic
  Republic of the Congo, is thought to be transmitted primarily through the respiratory
  tract and was followed by disseminated disease presentation. Both the dermal inoculation
  and respiratory routes could contribute to animal-to-human transmission. The size
  of the green arrows indicates the frequency of manifestation; a large arrow indicates
  a frequent pathway and a small arrow indicates an infrequent pathway.
