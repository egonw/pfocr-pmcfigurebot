figure_title: The activation of ERK by CPT has no significant effect on cell apoptosis
caption: U87 MG cells were pretreated with 20 μM ERK signaling pathway inhibitor PD98059
  (PD) for 1 hour and followed by exposure of 5 μM CPT for 24 hours. The cells were
  collected, and cell lysates were prepared for Western blot analysis. Antibodies
  used were indicated in . (A) Western blot profile. (B) Densitometric values for
  p-ERK. (C) Densitometric value for cleaved PARP. Data represent the mean ± S.E.M
  of three replicates. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.
