caption: Loss of Klotho heterozygosity leads to changes in vascular structure and
  abnormalities of the YAP signaling pathway in vascular endothelial cells. (A) H&E
  staining showed the abnormal structure of blood vessels and capillaries in the kidney
  tissue of Klotho+/- mice. Magnification 400×. scale bar = 30μm. (B) The measurement
  results of vascular lumen area and vascular elastic lamina area on renal vascular
  and blood capillary. **P<0.01 vs WT group, *P<0.05 vs WT group, t test. (C) Immunofluorescence
  staining showed that the expression of Klotho on vascular endothelial cells (CD31+)
  in kidney tissue of Klotho+/- mice decreased significantly. Magnification 400×.
  scale bar = 30μm. (D) Western blot showed that the expression of the YAPsignaling
  pathway in vascular endothelial cells of kidney tissue of Klotho+/- mice was abnormal.
article_title: Klotho promotes AMPK activity and maintains renal vascular integrity
  by regulating the YAP signaling pathway.
