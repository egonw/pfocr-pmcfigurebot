caption: Electron microscopic observation of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus.
  (a) Electron microscopy results of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of the two
  groups of mice. Neurons, synapses, arterioles, venules, and myelin sheaths are shown
  in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of the two groups of mice. Abnormal lipofuscin
  and autophagosomes were observed in cortical sites. (b and c) Statistical analyses
  of synapses in the cortex and hippocampus of the two groups of mice. Many aging
  neurons and abnormal subcellular structures were found in the brains of Mut mice.
  The number of synapses was remarkably reduced. Some capillaries, venules, and arterioles
  were abnormal in shape. Abnormal endothelial cell proliferation, mitochondria; swelling
  in endothelial cells, lumen narrowing, lipofuscin accumulation, and abnormal autophagosomes
  in some cells were observed. The myelin structure of the WT mice was intact, whereas
  that of the Mut mice was abnormal with varying degrees of disintegration, degeneration,
  and swelling in the myelin lamella. The number of synapses in Mut mice was significantly
  lower than that in WT mice (p < .001). The red asterisk denotes the synapse.
