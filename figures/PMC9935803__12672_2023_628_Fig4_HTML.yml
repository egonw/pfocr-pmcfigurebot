caption: Glutamine promotes O-GlcNAc biosynthesis. A, B The addition of 2 mM glutamine
  to glutamine-free medium increased the expression of O-GlcNAc in SW1990, BxPC-3,
  and SU.8686 cells, as shown by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Cells were
  cultured in different media for 72 h. Quantification is shown to the right. Data
  were randomly chosen in seven different fields. Scale bars, 25 μm. C The expression
  of O-GlcNAc in cells cultured in medium containing various concentrations (0, 2,
  10 mM) of glutamine for 72 h was examined by Western blot. D The expression of O-GlcNAc
  in cells cultured for 72 h in glutamine-free medium, 2 mM glutamine medium, and
  2 mM glutamine medium treated with 50 µM Don or 10 µM Aza was examined by Western
  blot. E, F Representative image (E) and quantification (F) of the expression of
  O-GlcNAc in high-glutamine pancreatic cancers versus low-glutamine pancreatic cancers
  as observed by immunofluorescence in clinical samples. n = 6 cases in each group.
  Scale bars, 50 μm. G Fractional isotopomer labelling of UDP-GlcNAc from [U-15N]-L-glutamine
  after 12 h and 24 h using UHPLC-MS. All data are presented as the mean ± s.e.m.
  M + (M0, M1 to Mn) represents the number of C or N in metabolites labeled by isotopes.
  The fractional abundance of mass isotopomers defined by M0, M1, and Mn was calculated.
