caption: 'Friedelin abolished scopolamine-induced oxidative stress and glial cell
  activation in adult mice brain. Shown are the different antioxidant enzyme assays
  (a) Lipid peroxidase, TBARS (b) Superoxide dismutase, SOD (c) peroxidase enzyme,
  POD (d) Catalase enzyme, CAT and (e) Glutathione, GSH performed with brain homogenates
  of experimental mice treated either with scopolamine alone or in combination with
  friedelin, respectively. (f) Shown are western blot bands of glial cells along with
  respective histograms at (g,h). The treatment details have already been given in
  the materials and methods section. The results are stated as Mean ± S.E.M (n = 5).
  Significance of control vs. scopolamine is expressed as #, while * denotes scopolamine
  Vs scopolamine + friedelin. Significance: **, ## p < 0.01 and ***, ### p < 0.001.'
