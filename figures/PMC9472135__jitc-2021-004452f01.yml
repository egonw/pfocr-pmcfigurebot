caption: 'High LRIG2 is correlated with higher glioma TAM density and shorter survival.
  LRIG family members’ expression level in glioma cells and the infiltration of immune
  cells from the SCEA datasets *P<0.05,**P<0.01.(A) and GEO datasets (GSE131928; GSE135437)
  (B). Unpaired Student’s t-test. Error bar=SD. (C) GO and KEGG pathway enrichment
  analysis of LRIG2-related gene sets in glioma from the TCGA datasets. (D) Representative
  IHC images of the infiltration of immune cell subsets in LRIG2 high (H-SCORE≥6）and
  low expression (H-SCORE<6) tumors. Top panel: scale bar, 400 µm. Bottom panel: scale
  bar, 80 µm. (E) Correlation analysis between the protein expression(D) of LRIG2
  and the TAM marker CD68 and CD206 in clinical glioma tissue microarray (n=88, H-SCORE).
  Pearson’s correlation test. (F) Kaplan-Meier survival curves for correlation between
  mRNA and protein expression of LRIG2 and survival of glioma patients in the CGGA
  dataset and clinical glioma tissue microarray. Log-rank test. (G) Kaplan-Meier survival
  analysis for the correlation between infiltration degree of immune cell subsets
  in glioma microenvironment and survival of glioma patients in the CGGA dataset and
  clinical glioma tissue microarray, log-rank test. CGGA, Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas;
  KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; ns, not significant; TAM, tumor-associated
  microglia/macrophage; TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas.'
