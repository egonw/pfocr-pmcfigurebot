caption: BEND5 eliminates Notch signaling-induced BC cell proliferation, migration
  and invasion. (A) GSEA was conducted to predict the function of BEND5 in BC. (B)
  MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with empty vector or FLAG-tagged BEND5 and treated
  with/without Notch signaling activator DLL4 (10 ng/ml). Immunoblot was used to detect
  Notch pathway downstream targets and EMT-related proteins. (C and D) CCK8 assays
  and colony formation assays for MDA-MB-231 cells transfected and treated as in (B).
  (E and F) Wound-healing assays and transwell assays for MDA-MB-231 cells transfected
  and treated as in (B). Data shown are mean Â± SD of triplicate measurements with
  similar results (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01).
