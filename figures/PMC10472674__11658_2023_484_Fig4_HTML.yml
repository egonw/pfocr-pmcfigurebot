caption: 'Overexpression of UGCG aggravated heart remodeling. A, F Masson staining
  showed the overall degree of myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis (N = 5). B, G The
  representative pictures of the size of the cross-sectional area of cardiomyocytes
  in the heart and corresponding statistical analysis histogram (N = 5). C–E Statistical
  charts of HW/BW, LW/BW, and HW/TL in different groups (N = 5). H–K Western blot
  results of Col1, ANP, and BNP expression levels in hearts from different groups
  (N = 3). L, N HE staining showed the cell surface area of cardiomyocytes from different
  groups (N = 6). M, O Immunohistochemical images of α-SMA staining in heart fibroblasts
  from different groups (N = 6). P–R Western blot results of ANP, BNP expression levels
  in cardiomyocytes from different groups (N = 3). *p < 0.05, ns: No significance.
