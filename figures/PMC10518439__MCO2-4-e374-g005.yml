caption: Schematic illustration of the different pyroptosis pathways. At present,
  there are mainly four distinct signaling pathways that have been identified to induce
  pyroptosis, including the classical caspase 1‐dependent pathway, which depend on
  the inflammasomes, nonclassical caspase 4/5/11‐dependent pathway, caspase 3/caspase
  8‐mediated pathway, and granzymes‐mediated pathway. DAMP, danger‐associated molecular
  patterns; PAMP, pathogen‐associated molecular patterns; LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  IL‐1β, interleukin‐1β; IL‐18, interleukin‐18; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; HMGB1,
  high mobility group box 1; GZMA, granzyme A; GZMB, granzyme B; GBP, guanylate‐binding
  proteins; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IFN‐γ, interferon‐γ; IFNGR, IFN‐gamma receptor;
  Cyc‐c, cytochrome c; NK, natural killer cells; CTL, cytotoxic T lymphocytes.
