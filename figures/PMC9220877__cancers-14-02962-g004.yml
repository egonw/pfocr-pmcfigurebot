caption: Pathway analysis of cancer cells that expressed any amount of NR2F1. Dot
  plots showing GSEA comparing cancer cells with positive and negative NR2F1 expression
  in single−cell Cohort 1 (left) and Cohort 2 (right). Only significant gene sets
  from HALLMARK are shown in the figure. The size of each dot represents adjusted
  p value, and the x−axis and color tone represent NES.
