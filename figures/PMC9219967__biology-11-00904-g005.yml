caption: 'Chlorophyll metabolic pathway. Genes are shown in different colors. Relative
  gene expression levels are indicated by a color gradient from low (green) to high
  (red). Squares are arranged from left to right: MS1 (early senescence stage of mutant),
  MS2 (late senescence stage of mutant), WS1 (early senescence stage of wild-type),
  and WS2 (late senescence stage of wild-type). Numbers in the scale bar represent
  normalized transcripts per kilobase million (TPM) values of genes.'
