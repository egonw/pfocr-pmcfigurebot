caption: Upregulation of MEK/ERK signaling pathway activates inflamed Crohn's mesentery
  macrophage activation and migration. (A) Upstream regulation of differentially expressed
  genes by MEK/ERK on the activation of macrophages in CD SubQ versus CD Mes comparison.
  Grey, expressed; Red, upregulated; Orange, activated. (B) Upstream regulation of
  differentially expressed genes by MEK/ERK on the migration of macrophages in CD
  SubQ versus CD Mes comparison. Grey, expressed; Red, upregulated; Orange, activated.
  (C) Western blot analysis of CD patients' noninflamed and inflamed mesentery for
  ERK, MEK, and Actin. (D) Densitometry of ERK and MEK normalized to actin and the
  matching noninflamed tissue. CD, Crohn's disease.
