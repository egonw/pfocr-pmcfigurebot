caption: Fungal resistance against antifungal compounds. (A) Fungi likely increase
  the production of enzymes that are main targets for the drugs. This counters the
  inhibition of metabolic activities. (B) Modifying the spatial structure of target
  enzyme minimizes the drug binding efficiency. (C) Efflux pumps efficiently pumps
  out the antifungal drugs out of the cell. (D) fungal cell wall/membrane blocks the
  penetration of antifungals. (E) The fungal cell escapes the routine pathway that
  the drug recognizes to target. (E) The secretion of extracellular enzymes having
  the ability to degrade the antifungal drug.
