caption: Engeletin alleviates CSDS‐induced depressive‐like behaviours. (A) An overview
  of the relative timing of CSDS modelling, engeletin treatment, and behavioural testing
  (SPT, SIT, TST, FST and OFT), which was performed at the end of the study for all
  mice. (B–G) The effects of engeletin on SPT (B, C), SIT (D), TST (E), FST (F) and
  open field test (OPT) (G) test performance. Results are means ± SEM. (n = 12). *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ****p < 0.0001, one‐ or two‐way ANOVAs with Bonferroni post hoc testing.
  CSDS, chronic stress social defeat stress; FST, forced swimming test; SIT, social
  interaction test; TST, tail suspension test.
