caption: 'Application of the PHENotype SIMulator: By modeling human host-cell infection
  with a pathogen in silico - in this case SARS-CoV-2 - we can acquire a cell-specific
  viral signature and formulate multiple drug repurposing hypotheses; (I) logFold
  Changes (logFCs) of Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) arising from transcriptomic
  genome wide expression analysis of infected vs. baseline uninfected cells are used
  to represent a virus in the meta-pathway; (II) we run the PHENSIM simulation by
  upregulating the viral node and collect all perturbation values computed by PHENSIM
  for pathway endpoints to define a cell-specific pathogen signature. (III) The same
  process is applied to expression data arising from whole transcriptome-wide expression
  analysis of drug treated vs. mock-treated cell lines, yielding a cell-specific drug
  signature. This process is iterated for each drug we wish to test and collected
  in a database of drug signatures. (IV) Finally, a Pearson correlation analysis between
  the pathogen and each drug signature is utilized to score repurposing candidates.'
