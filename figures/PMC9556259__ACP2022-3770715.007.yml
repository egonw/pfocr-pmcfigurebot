caption: MK2206 2HCl induces cell cycle arrest at G2/M in OSCC cell lines. (a) MK2206
  2HCl induces cell cycle arrest at G2/M in CAL27 cells. (b) MK2206 2HCl induces cell
  cycle arrest at G2/M in SCC25 cells. (c) MK2206 2HCl increased the protein expression
  of p21 and inhibited p-Rb expression by western blotting in CAL27 and SCC25 cells.
  All data are presented as the mean ± SD. ∗∗P < 0.01 as compared with the control
  group.
