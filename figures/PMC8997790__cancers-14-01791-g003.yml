caption: HIF-1/2α subunits regulation by calcitriol at the level of their protein
  synthesis. HIF-1/2α mRNA translation is mainly regulated by the PI3K/AKT pathway,
  which frequently cross-talks with ERKs. Calcitriol in complex with VDR enhances
  DDIT4 expression and impairs mTORC1-mediated translation of HIF-1/2α. Furthermore,
  calcitriol treatment results in decreased phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT-pathway components
  and limits HIF-1/2α translation rates.
