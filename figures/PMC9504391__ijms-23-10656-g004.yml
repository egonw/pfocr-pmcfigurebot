caption: Overexpression of OsABT inhibits ABA synthesis under salt stress. (A,B) Root
  and leaf ABA content of the two–week–old OsABT–OE line (OE–3) and WT plants exposed
  to salt stress (200 mM NaCl) for 0, 12, and 24 h. (C–E) Root expression of the ABA
  synthesis genes OsNCED3 and OsNCED4, and the ABA catabolic gene OsABA8ox2 in the
  two–week–old OsABT–OE line (OE–3) and WT plants. Root RNA was isolated and used
  for qRT–PCR. Actin was used as an internal control. The relative expression levels
  were represented by fold change relative to the expression in WT plants before salt
  treatment (0 h). Data are means ± SD of three independent experiments. Asterisks
  indicate significant differences compared to WT at * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 (Student’s
  t–test).
