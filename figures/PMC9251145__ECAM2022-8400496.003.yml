caption: '(a) Schematic diagram of the molecular docking between Sal B and target
  proteins. A, B: conformation of Sal B (green) and target proteins; C, D: the binding
  sites of Sal B (green) with TLR4 or NLRP3; E, F: schematic diagram of Sal B binding
  to TLR4 or NLRP3; G, H: the docking amino acid residues of Sal B and TLR4 or NLRP3.
  Sal B decreased the protein levels of TLR4, NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1, p-NF-κB, IL-18,
  IL-1β, and TNF-α. (b) Iopromide treatment caused a significant increase in TLR4,
  NLRP3, ASC, and Caspase-1. Sal B counteracted the iopromide-induced increase in
  these protein levels. n = 3. Data are the mean ± SD. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. control group;
  #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 vs. iopromide group. (c) The protein levels of p-NF-κB, IL-18,
  IL-1β, and TNF-α were significantly increased in iopromide-treated cells. These
  changes were reduced by 100 μmol/L Sal B n = 3. Data are the mean ± SD. ∗P < 0.05,
  ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. control group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 vs. iopromide group.'
