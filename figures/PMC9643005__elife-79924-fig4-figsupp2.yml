figure_title: Individual patient longitudinal DN2 and activated naïve B cell responses
  and detailed analysis of the activated naïve B cell response
caption: Individual longitudinal DN2 (A (i)) and activated naïve (A (ii)) B cell responses.
  (B) The activated naïve B cell frequencies were tracked longitudinally and with
  respect to disease severity (ordinal scale 1–3) and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio
  (NLR), respectively. Error bars indicate standard deviation (HIV- n = 37; HIV+ n
  = 33). (C) Spearman non-parametric correlation of the activated naïve B cell response
  relative to the anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody titre. Statistical analyses
  were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis H test for multiple comparisons and Mann-Whitney
  for disease severity or NLR comparisons within groups. p Values are denoted by *≤0.05;
  **<0.01; ***<0.001, and ****<0.0001.
