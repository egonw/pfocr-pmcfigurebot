caption: Schematic diagram of changes in orbital fibroblasts under the intervention
  of oxidative stress and gypenosides. Under the condition of oxidative stress, the
  increase of endogenous ROS leads to the occurrence of endoplasmic reticulum stress.
  On the one hand, endoplasmic reticulum stress induces the occurrence of autophagy.
  If the oxidative stress damage is serious, autophagy cannot fully digest the damaged
  organelles. It will lead to increased ROS production and promote the start of apoptosis-related
  processes leading to apoptosis. On the other hand, endoplasmic reticulum stress
  can promote ERK phosphorylation, allowing Nrf2 to interact with its inhibitor under
  oxidative stress, causing Nrf2 to accumulate in the cytoplasm, and Nrf2 translocated
  to the nucleus and combined with antioxidant response elements. Gypenosides as an
  antioxidant can enhance the role of endogenous Nrf2 pathway activator. Under oxidative
  stress, gypenosides can promote ERK phosphorylation and accelerate the dissociation
  of Nrf2 from Keap1, resulting in more Nrf2 translocation to the nucleus. NRF2 binds
  through antioxidant response elements and regulates the expression of its downstream
  target gene (HO-1), to prevent oxidative stress and damage.
