caption: The PI3k signaling pathway is illustrated in a schematic form within the
  context of the pathophysiology of cancer. The tyrosine kinase receptor is activated
  in response to stimulation from EGF, shh, IGF-1, insulin, and CAM. As a direct consequence
  of this, PI3k was turned on, which caused PIP2 to be converted into PIP3. Following
  this step, Akt is phosphorylated and activated. This activation is led by PIP3,
  mTORC2, PDK1, and PI3K. As a result, Akt promotes cell proliferation by activating
  CREB while inhibiting p27. Through its impact on mTORC1 and the pathways that are
  downstream from it, Akt is able to decrease 4EBP1 and P70 gene expression while
  simultaneously enhancing the activity of essential cellular processes. In addition,
  since FOXO is phosphorylated, it is stopped from getting into the nucleus. As a
  consequence of this mechanism, p27 and p21 gene expression is constrained []. The
  AKT pathway is an essential signaling system that is involved in cell survival,
  growth, and proliferation. It is often mis regulated in cancer cells due to its
  importance in these processes. Polyphenols have the potential to affect the AKT
  pathway by either suppressing the activity of certain proteins in the pathway or
  activating those proteins. For instance, research has revealed that some polyphenols
  may suppress the activity of PDK, which is an upstream regulator of the protein
  kinase AKT. When PDK is inhibited, its activity is prevented, which in turn leads
  to a reduction in both the survival and proliferation of cells [, , ]. Cisplatin,
  for instance, has been shown to activate the AKT pathway in certain cancer cells,
  which results in improved cell survival as well as resistance to chemotherapy. Cisplatin
  has also been shown to have the ability to block the activity of the tumor suppressor
  PTEN, which functions to negatively regulate the AKT pathway. Because of this, there
  is a potential for enhanced AKT activation as well as cell survival [,].
