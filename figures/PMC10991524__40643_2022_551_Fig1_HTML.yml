caption: Construction of α-alkenes biosynthetic pathway in P. pastoris. a Schematic
  illustration of metabolic pathways engineered for the production of α-alkenes from
  FFA via three pathways. b FFA titers of faa1Δ strain in shake flask after 96 h cultivation
  in 20 g/L glucose medium or 120 h cultivation in 20 g/L methanol medium. c α-Alkenes
  production from three different decarboxylases in glucose medium. d α-Alkenes profiles
  of the engineered strain with expression of different decarboxylases in glucose
  medium. C15:1, 1-pentadecene; C17:1, 1-heptadecene; C17:2, 1,8-heptadecadiene. e
  Comparison of episomal expression and chromosome integration of UndB for α-alkenes
  production. All data were represented as the mean ± s.d. of three samples
