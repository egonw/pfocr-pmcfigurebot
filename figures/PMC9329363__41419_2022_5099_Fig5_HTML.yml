figure_title: ARHGEF2 as a new target for promoting angiogenesis
caption: A The cell-conditioned media of HepG2/shNC and HepG2/shARHGEF2 cells were
  collected for tube formation assay. B Representative images of CAM blood vessels
  stimulated with cell-conditioned media from the indicated cells. C, D The migration
  and invasion ability of CM-treated HUVEC cells were detected by wound-healing assay
  and transwell assay. Eâ€“H The cell-conditioned media of MHCC97H/Vector and MHCC97H/ARHGEF2
  cells were collected for tube formation assay (E), CAM assay (F), wound-healing
  assay (G) and transwell assay (H).
