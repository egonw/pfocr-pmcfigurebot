caption: 'Effect of GA on the mitochondrial pathway of H9C2 cells. H9C2 cells were
  pretreated for 24 h with 15, 30, and 45 M GA. (a) JC-1 was used to stain H9C2 cells,
  and the MMP was examined using a fluorescent microscope. Scale bar: 100 μm. (b,
  c) GA boosted Bax expression but decreased Bcl-2 expression. ADR, adriamycin (positive
  control for the mitochondrial apoptosis test). Values reflect the mean ± SD of three
  independent experiments.∗P < 0.05 vs. the control group.'
