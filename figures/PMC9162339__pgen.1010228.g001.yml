figure_title: Workflow and results of the in vivo, small molecule screen
caption: A) Screening strategy to identify compounds that rescue lethality in dNGLY1pl/pl
  flies. B) Seventeen hit compounds were identified from the 1040 compounds screened
  from the Prestwick Chemical Library. Total fly counts for each drug treatment in
  the primary screen, with the dNGLY1pl/pl genotype in grey and heterozygous dNGLY1+/pl
  genotype in black.
article_title: An in vivo drug repurposing screen and transcriptional analyses reveals
  the serotonin pathway and GSK3 as major therapeutic targets for NGLY1 deficiency.
