caption: Subversions of miRNAs in AML. microRNAs are (A) upregulated, (B) downregulated
  or (C) dysregulated. Many of these miRNAs directly or indirectly target common protein
  families such as cyclins and cyclin‚Äêdependant kinases, or common pathways such as
  the PI3K and MAPK pathway. These microRNAs are key components of haematopoiesis
  and their preferential targets regulate key aspects of the cell cycle, maturation
  and cellular senescence, and as such their dysregulation is implicated in leukaemogenesis.
