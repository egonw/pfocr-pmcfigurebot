caption: ELF1 modulates JAK-STAT signaling pathway via DCLK1. A. Gene set enrichment
  analysis was adopted to analyze the signaling pathway related to DCLK1. B. The ELF1
  overexpression plasmid and si-DCLK1 were co-transfected into Capan-2 cells, and
  the si-ELF1 and DCLK1 overexpression plasmids were co-transfected into PANC-1 cells.
  JAK2 expression and STAT3 expression were analyzed by Western blot assay. C. After
  ELF1 overexpression plasmids were transfected into Capan-2 cells, the Capan-2 cells
  with ELF1 overexpression and the control Capan-2 cells were subcutaneously transplanted
  into nude mice, and the tumor size of the two groups (3 mice per group) was compared.
  D. The expression levels of ELF1, DCLK1, STAT3 and JAK2 in the tumor tissues of
  the two groups of mice were detected by Western blot and compared.
