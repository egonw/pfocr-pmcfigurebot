caption: Identification of pathways underlying liver metabolism regulated by PP2A.A,
  comparative analysis was performed in HO mice by ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA)
  to explore the pathways based on the differentially expressed genes and hyperphosphorylated
  proteins. Pathway analysis with p < 0.05 was considered significantly enriched.
  Molecule activity predictor analysis was conducted to predict the effect on the
  downstream function upon suppression of AHR signaling pathways (B), CAR signaling
  pathways (C), xenobiotic metabolism pathways (D), or activation of drug transport
  (E). The possible interaction molecules in the network were illustrated based on
  IPA. AHR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor; CAR, constitutive active androstane receptor;
  HO, homozygous knockout; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A.
