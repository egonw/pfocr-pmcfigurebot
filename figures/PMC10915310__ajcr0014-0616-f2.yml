caption: Effects of ELF1 on the proliferation and apoptosis of PC cells. A. The transfection
  efficiency of ELF1 overexpression plasmid and si-ELF1 was detected by Western blot.
  B. The effects of ELF1 overexpression or knockdown on the viability of Capan-2 and
  PANC-1 cells were detected by CCK-8 assay. C. The effects of ELF1 overexpression
  or knockdown on the proliferation of Capan-2 and PANC-1 cells were detected by EdU
  assay (scale bars =50 Î¼m). D. The effects of ELF1 overexpression or knockdown on
  the apoptosis of Capan-2 and PANC-1 cells were detected by flow cytometry. *P <
  0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001.
article_title: E74-like ETS transcription factor 1 promotes the progression of pancreatic
