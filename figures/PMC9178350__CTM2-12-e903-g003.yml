caption: 'Hyperactivation of mTORC1 induced the premature aging of the intestinal
  epithelial cells of EpCAM–/– mice. (A) Graphs showed the relative mRNA expression
  levels of TSC1 in small intestines of WT and EpCAM–/– pups from P0 and P3 stages,
  respectively (n = 8 per group). ***P < 0.001, *P < 0.05 compared with WT group.
  (B) The mRNA expression levels of TSC2 in the small intestines of WT and EpCAM–/–
  mice at P0 and P3 stage, respectively (P0: WT, n = 6; EpCAM–/–, n = 8. P3: WT, n
  = 8; EpCAM–/–, n = 8). **P < 0.01 compared with WT group. (C) Western blot results
  showed the levels of p‐TSC2, TSC2, TSC1, p‐mTOR, mTOR, p‐S6, S6, p‐4EBP1 and 4EBP1
  in the small Intestines of WT and EpCAM–/– pups at P3 stage (6 mice in each group
  for three times independent experiments). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. (D) Images of the
  immunofluorescence staining of p‐S6 in sections of jejunum from WT, EpCAM–/– and
  RAP administrated EpCAM–/– pups at P3 stage. Scale bar, 50 μm. (E) Western blot
  results showed the levels of EpCAM, p‐S6, S6, p‐4EBP1 and 4EBP1 in the small intestines
  from WT, EpCAM–/– and RAP administrated EpCAM–/– pups at P3 stage (4 mice in each
  group for two times independent experiments). (F) Images of H&E staining of jejunum
  from WT, EpCAM–/– an RAP administrated EpCAM–/– pups at P3 stage. (G) Western blot
  results showed the levels of TERT, γH2AX, H2AX and SIRT1‐7 in the small intestines
  from WT, EpCAM–/– and RAP administrated EpCAM–/– pups at P3 stage (4 mice in each
  group for two times independent experiments). (H) Western blot results showed the
  levels of TSC1, p‐S6, S6, p‐4EBP1 and 4EBP1 in the small intestines from WT, EpCAM–/–
  and MDL‐800 administrated EpCAM–/– mice at P3 stage (4 mice in each group for two
  times independent experiments). (I) Schematic model of the signalling pathway that
  EpCAM maintains the longevity of intestinal epithelial cells'
