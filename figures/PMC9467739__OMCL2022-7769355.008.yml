caption: Schematic hypothesis of the antiferroptosis effect of QCT in Parkinson's
  disease. MPP+- and MPTP-induced ferroptosis is involved in midbrain dopaminergic
  neuronal death. QCT positively regulated SLC7A11 and GPX4 protein levels by activating
  the Nrf2 pathway. Furthermore, QCT alleviates mitochondrial dysfunction and decreases
  mitochondrial ROS generation, which is a core factor for ferroptosis.
