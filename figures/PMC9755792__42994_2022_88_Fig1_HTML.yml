caption: Solyc12g098370 is highly co-expressed with SlLCYE in MicroTom tomato. A Schematic
  representation of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway. B Correlation analysis of
  lutein content and SlLCYE transcript level. C The 93 co-expressed candidates shared
  by both MMN and TEA, with a threshold r > 0.8. D Co-expression analysis of SlLCYE
  and Solyc12g098370 transcript levels in the MMN database. Multiple tomato developmental
  stages of leaves (L), roots (R), stems (S), flowers (F), as well as fruits are shown
  on the X axis. E Co-expression analysis of SlLCYE and Solyc12g098370 transcript
  levels in the TEA database. Mature green, MG. Red ripe, RR
article_title: G2-LIKE CAROTENOID REGULATOR (SlGCR) is a positive regulator of lutein
  biosynthesis in tomato.
