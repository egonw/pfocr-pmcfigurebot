caption: 'qPCR analysis of mRNA of cua genes. The analyses were made on derivatives
  of R. cellulolyticum mutant strains MTLcuaD: MTLcuaD(pSOScuaDSR) (A) or MTLcuaD(pSOScuaSR)
  (B). Total RNA was extracted from cultures of the strains grown to OD 0.6 in minimal
  medium supplemented with 0.2% arabinose (gray bars) or 0.2% cellobiose (green bars)
  as the only carbon source. Normalization was performed using the expression level
  of RNA16S gene. Normalized fold expression was calculated comparatively to the strain
  MTLcuaD grown in minimal medium containing 0.2% arabinose. Error bars indicate the
  standard deviation of three independent experiments.'
