caption: miR-187 overexpression facilitates GC development. A cell model of miR-187
  overexpression was established in MKN-45 and AGS cells. (a) RT-qPCR examined miR-187
  expression. (b) RT-qPCR confirmed miR-187 expression in GC tissues and normal paracancer
  tissues. (c, d) CCK8 and BrdU measured MKN-45 and AGS cell viability. (e) Transwell
  monitored invasion and migration in MKN-45 and AGS cells. (f) Flow cytometry evaluated
  cell apoptosis. (g) Western blot verified the profiles of Bcl2, Bax, and Bad. ∗∗P
  < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001 (vs. the miR-NC group). N = 3.
