figure_title: MEX3A knockdown leads to decreased proliferation, migration, and invasion
  as well as increased apoptosis in NPC cell lines
caption: 'A The knockdown efficiencies of various MEX3A shRNAs in C666-1 cells were
  determined by qRT-PCR. B MEX3A protein levels in shCtrl and shMEX3A stable C666-1
  and HONE-1 cell lines were detected by western blotting. C Cell proliferation rates
  of C666-1 and HONE-1 cells after shCtrl and shMEX3A lentivirus infection were determined
  by MTT assay. D Colony formation abilities of C666-1 and HONE-1 cells infected with
  shCtrl or shMEX3A lentivirus were detected by colony formation assay. E Migration
  rates of C666-1 and HONE-1 cells were determined by wound healing assay at 0, 24,
  and 48 h after infection. F Migration and invasion abilities of C666-1 and HONE-1
  cells infected with shCtrl and shMEX3A lentivirus were determined by Transwell assay.
  Magnification: 200×. G The effect of MEX3A knockdown on cell apoptosis was measured
  by flow cytometry. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.'
