caption: lncRNA PRKG1-AS1 regulated by UC.145 affects DKK1 expression. (a) PRKG1-AS1
  expression was confirmed under UC.145 expression using qRT-PCR; (b) PRKG1-AS1 expression
  in GC samples was confirmed according to classification based on the median expression
  of UC.145 using qRT-PCR; (c) Correlation between UC.145 and PRKG-AS1 analyzed using
  Prism software; (d) Change in UC.145 and (e) DKK1 expression confirmed under PRKG1-AS1
  overexpression using qRT-PCR. PRKG-AS1 overexpression caused changes in (f) DKK1
  protein level (detected using Western blotting), (g) methylation using MS-PCR, and
  (h) EZH2 protein level (using Western blotting); (i) Silencing UC.145 via siRNA
  or ectopic overexpression of PRKG1-AS1 confirmed EZH2 binding using qRT-PCR through
  the RIP assay; (j) Western blotting of DKK1, Wnt ligand Wnt5a, and β-catenin components
  of Wnt/β-catenin following the modulation of UC.145 and PRKG1-AS1 expression. (k)
  Kaplan–Meier estimates of the overall survival rate of patients with high or low
  UC.145 expression; log-rank p = 0.0116 (left panel). The overall survival rate of
  patients with high expression of UC.145 and low expression of DKK1 and PRKG1-AS1.
  Log-rank p = 0.0117 (right panel). Data are shown as mean ± SD of three independent
  experiments (** p ≤ 0.01).
