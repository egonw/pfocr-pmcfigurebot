figure_title: CircSEMA4B regulates PDCD4 and PI3K/AKT pathway through acting as a
  sponge for miR-330-3p
caption: a, b miR-330-3p-mimics rescued the suppressive effects of LV-circSEMA4B in
  BC cells by MTT assay. c miR-330-3p-mimics rescued the suppressive effects of LV-circSEMA4B
  in BC cells by colony formation assay. d miR-330-3p-mimics rescued the suppressive
  effects of LV-circSEMA4B in BC cells by transwell assay. e Western blot showed that
  miR-330-3p-mimics can partly rescue the high expression of PDCD4 and low expression
  of p-AKT(S473) caused by LV-circSEMA4B in BC cells. f, g Effect of circSEMA4B on
  proliferation in BC cell lines treated with MK2206 by MTT assay. h Effect of circSEMA4B
  on proliferation in BC cell lines treated with MK2206 by colony formation assay.
  i Effect of circSEMA4B on migration and invasion in MDA-MB-231 cell line treated
  with MK2206 using transwell chambers.

  novel protein SEMA4B-211aa and regulating AKT phosphorylation.
