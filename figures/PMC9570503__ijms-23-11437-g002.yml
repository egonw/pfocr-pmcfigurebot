caption: 'Modulating effect of the conditioned media from the ectopic WISP1 overexpressed-HEK
  293 cells on the cell migration in the prostate fibroblast HPrF cells. (A) Expressions
  of WISP1v1 and WISP1v2 after the ectopic-overexpressed WISP1v1 and WISP1v2 in the
  HEK293 cells were assessed by the RT-PCR (M: 100 bp Marker; 1: HPrF_shCOL; 2: HPrF_shWISP1),
  ELISA (B), and immunoblot (C) assays. The abilities of migration in HPrF cells treated
  with the conditioned media of the ectopic WISP1v1- (D) or WISP1v2- (E) overexpressed-HEK293
  cells. The white line indicated the average of the cellular leading edges and the
  size of the wound area was calculated by ImageJ. Data are presented as the mean
  percentage (Â±SE; n = 3) in relation to the mock-transfected HEK293 (293-DNA) cells.
  ** p < 0.01; ND: no detectable.'
