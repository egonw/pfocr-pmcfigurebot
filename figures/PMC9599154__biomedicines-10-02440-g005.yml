caption: Differences in gene expression between HGPS and aging. (A) Venn diagram visualizing
  the GO BPs enriched in HGPS (blue), aging (yellow), and in the 157 common DEGs of
  progeria and aging. 15 BPs are enriched in all three analyses. (B) Heat plot visualizing
  the changes in gene expression in the DEGs involved in the 15 BPs using the changes
  in gene expression observed while comparing nonagenarians and healthy children (log2foldchanges
  of DESeq2 analysis). (C) Heat plot visualizing the changes in gene expression in
  the DEGs involved in the 15 BPs using the changes in gene expression observed while
  comparing progeria patients and healthy children (log2foldchanges of DESeq2 analysis).
  The differences in gene expression are indicated by color (red for upregulated,
  blue for downregulated). Notably, UCP2, which is involved in gland development,
  is upregulated in progeria but downregulated in aging. ACKR4, which is involved
  in the cytokine-mediated signaling pathway, is upregulated in aging (comparison
  of healthy children and nonagenarians) but downregulated in progeria (comparison
  of healthy children and progeria patients).
