  were Enriched in OCYYoung‐EVs. A) Heatmap of the differentially enriched proteins
  between OCYYoung‐EVs and OCYAged‐EVs (more than 1.5‐fold, P < 0.05). The protein
  levels were normalized by Z‐Score. B) The top 30 enriched GO terms (BP, CC, and
  MF) of differentially expressed proteins between OCYYoung‐EVs and OCYAged‐EVs (OCYYoung‐EVs/OCYAged‐EVs
  > 1.5). C) The network of top 30 enriched KEGG pathway terms of differentially expressed
  proteins (OCYYoung‐EVs/OCYAged‐EVs > 1.5). D) The network between enriched KEGG
  pathway (top 5) and genes. The fold change was used to show the ratio of protein
  expression levels between OCYYoung‐EVs and OCYAged‐EVs.
