caption: 'miR-22 diminishes PD-L1 expression via targeting BATF3 in CRC cells. (a)
  The binding relationship between BATF3 and PD-L1 (namely, CD274) analyzed by hTFtarget
  database. (b) mRNA expression of BATF3 in CRC tissues and adjacent normal tissues
  determined by RT-qPCR. (c) Protein expression of BATF3 in CRC tissues and adjacent
  normal tissues determined by Western blot analysis. (d) The expression of BATF3
  in CRC tissues and adjacent normal tissues determined by IHC. (e) Protein expression
  of BATF3 in FHC and CRC cell lines determined by Western blot analysis. (f) mRNA
  expression of BATF3 in FHC and CRC cell lines determined by RT-qPCR. (g) mRNA expression
  of PD-L1 in SW480 cells treated with sh-BATF3-1 or sh-BATF3-2 determined by RT-qPCR.
  (h) Protein expression of PD-L1 in SW480 cells treated with sh-BATF3-1 or sh-BATF3-2
  determined by Western blot analysis. (i) The binding site of miR-22 in the 3′UTR
  of BATF3 mRNA predicted using TargetScan website. (j) The binding of miR-22 to BATF3
  confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay. (k) The expression of miR-22, BATF3,
  and PD-L1 in SW480 cells treated with miR-22 mimic, miR-22 inhibitor, miR-22 mimic+OE-BATF3,
  or miR-22 mimic+OE-PD-L1 determined by RT-qPCR. (l) The protein expression of BATF3
  and PD-L1 normalized to GAPDH in SW480 cells treated with miR-22 mimic, miR-22 inhibitor,
  miR-22 mimic+OE-BATF3, or miR-22 mimic+OE-PD-L1 determined by Western blot analysis.
  ∗p < 0.05vs. adjacent normal tissues, FHC cell line, HEK293T cells transfected with
  mimic NC, or SW480 cells treated with sh-NC or mimic NC. #p < 0.05vs. SW480 cells
  treated with inhibitor NC. &p < 0.05vs. SW480 cells treated with miR-22 mimic. The
  cell experiment was run in triplicate independently.'
