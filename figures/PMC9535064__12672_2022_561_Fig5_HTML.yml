caption: ROCK1 induces LSCC metastasis in nude mice. A TU686/si-ROCK1, TU212/si-ROCK1,
  TU686/si-nc and TU212/si-nc cells were inoculated into nude mice and pulmonary nodules
  were observed after 42 days (N = 5/group). H&E stains of pulmonary nodules (100×).
  B Pulmonary tissue and nodules were quantified by H&E staining from TU686/si-ROCK1,
  TU212/si-ROCK1, TU686/si-nc and TU212/si-nc cells (**P < 0.01). C TU686/ROCK1, TU212/ROCK1,
  TU686/vector and TU212/vector cells were inoculated into nude mice and pulmonary
  nodules were observed after 42 days (N = 5/group). H&E stains of pulmonary nodules
  (100×). D Pulmonary tissue and nodules were quantified by H&E staining from TU686/ROCK1,
  TU212/ROCK1, TU686/vector and TU212/vector cells (**P < 0.01)
