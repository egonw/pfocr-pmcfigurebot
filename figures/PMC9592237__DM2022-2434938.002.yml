caption: LINC01140 overexpression inhibited BC cells tumorigenicity in vivo. Nude
  mice were injected with HCC1937 cells stably transfected with empty vector and LINC01140-OE
  (five mice/group). (a) Representative tumor images of nude mice. (b) Tumor growth
  curve of nude mice from day 0 to day 28. (c) Tumor weight of nude mice. ∗∗P < 0.001
  vs empty vector.
