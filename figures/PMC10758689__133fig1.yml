caption: Methodological framework overview. Schematic illustration of our workflow
  for enhancer mutation characterization. A, Lung-specific enhancer definition from
  eight different lung cell and tissue types. ChIP-seq for open chromatin (H3K27ac)
  and chromatin accessibility (DNase-seq or ATAC-seq) from each sample are intersected
  to obtain cell-specific putative enhancers. The union of the regions from each cell
  creates the master list after removing regions overlapping with promoters and exons.
  *, in the cell line, indicates the in-house data. B, Somatic mutation calling. Whole-genome
  sequencing data of tumor and corresponding normal blood of three lung cancer cohorts
  viz., LUAD, LUSC, and SCLC obtained from public resources are processed using an
  ensemble mutation calling approach to identify somatic mutations. C, Enhancer–target
  gene prediction using canonical correlation of functional genomics data to investigate
  the synchronized activity of enhancer–promoter pairs across multiple cell types.
  Implementation of the 3D colocalization information encoded in hierarchical contact
  score to control for FDR in multiple testing hypotheses. D, Reconstructed ETG network
  with somatic mutations in enhancers. Lung-specific enhancer regulatory network reconstructed
  with somatic mutations at enhancers obtained through steps A, B, and C. Dark cyan
  circles represent enhancers, red lightning marks represent mutations, and colored
  ovals represent genes. E, Aggregation of enhancer mutations at the pathway level.
  Pathway level enrichment of TGEM is performed using three approaches, that is, over-representation
  analysis to determine biological pathways with TGEM enrichment, direct heat diffusion
  to determine significantly affected sub-networks, and a global test to assess the
  effect of TGEM on gene expression at the pathway level. F, Functional analysis to
  characterize recurrently mutated enhancers. Recurrently mutated enhancer cores are
  determined for the functional characterization of a relevant enhancer mutation.
  The effect of the enhancer mutation on the target gene expression is assessed by
  stratifying patients based on the presence of the enhancer mutation. Similarly,
  survival probability is estimated in patients stratified on the basis of the presence
  of the enhancer mutation. TFBS alteration in the enhancer core upon somatic mutation
  is assessed to determine the mechanistic effect of enhancer mutation. (Created with
