caption: 'Reverse methanogenesis pathway supported by the model iMN22HE of M. nitroreducens.
  As shown, methane is the only carbon source. Through the reverse methanogenesis
  pathway, most of it is oxidized to carbon dioxide, with a small amount of carbon
  flux through the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway to generate acetyl-CoA for cell growth.
  Numbers in italics next to enzymes denote reaction fluxes (mmol gDW−1h−1) calculated
  under biomass (left) and ATP (right) maximum. Nitrate is the terminal electron acceptor,
  reduced by the NarGH-Rieske/cytochrome b complex, which drives the reverse methanogenesis
  in M. nitroreducens. Mcr, methyl-coenzyme M reductase, HdrABC, soluble F420-dependent
  heterodisulfide reductase, Mtr, methyl-H4MPT: coenzyme M methyltransferase, Cdh,
  CO dehydrogenase, Fqo, membrane-bound F420H2: quinone oxidoreductase, Nrf, nitrite
