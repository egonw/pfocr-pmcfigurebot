caption: Protein pathways analysis reveal glycolytic, neurodegenerative, and pro‐angiogenic
  pathways are the most similar comparing in vitro to in vivo. (a) Fewer proteins
  are shared between the culture (green) and tumour‐derived (orange) EVs for the 2K
  population; however, the shared pathways enriched are similar to the 10K and 100K
  populations. (b) 10K tumour‐derived EVs contain a majority of unique peptides compared
  to their culture counterparts. However, the 10K and 100K EVs are both enriched for
  peptides associated with T cell activation and Ras pathways. (c) Similar to the
  10K comparison, the 100K EVs from the tumour have a majority of unique peptides.
  Nevertheless, all shared pathways enriched between the EVs are indicative of neurodegenerative
  processes, as seen by the Parkinson's and Huntington's disease pathways, and all
  subpopulations are enriched for pro‐angiogenic factors as seen by the fibroblast
  growth factor signalling pathway and angiotensin‐II stimulated signalling
