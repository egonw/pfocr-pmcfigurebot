caption: 'Schematic diagram showing structure of the CTLA4-CD28 gene fusion. (A) Schematic
  diagram of the gene fusion. SP: signal peptide; TM: transmembrane region. (B) In
  normal T cells, activation of CD28 stimulates proliferation, which is inhibited
  by CTLA4 signaling. In tumor cells expressing the fusion protein, CTLA4 activation
  would aberrantly stimulate proliferation through the intracellular CD28 domain.'
