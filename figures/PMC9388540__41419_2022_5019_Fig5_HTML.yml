caption: 'A Left panel shows representative western blot of β-Catenin, GSK3β, and
  p-GSK3β levels in GSCs transduced with shNTC and shFMR1. Vinculin and Coomassie
  staining were used as normalisers. Right histogram represents the quantification
  of the biological replicates of p-GSK3β, β-Catenin and WNT5B (#148, #163, and #169
  GSCs). p-GSK3β was normalised over total GSK3β levels (mean ± SEM, n = 3 independent
  cell lines, each data point averaged from three FACS sortings, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001,
  One-sample t-test). B Left panel shows representative western blot of ERK1/2 and
  p-ERK1/2 levels in GSCs transduced with shNTC and shFMR1. Vinculin and Coomassie
  staining were used as normalisers. Right histogram represents the quantification
  of the biological replicates (#148, #163, and #169 GSCs). p-ERK1/2 was normalised
  over total ERK1/2 levels (mean ± SEM, n = 3 independent cell lines, each data point
  averaged from three FACS sortings, ***P < 0.001, One-sample t-test). C Left panel
  shows representative Western blot of CREB, p-CREB, ETS1 and p-ETS1 levels in GSCs
  transduced with shNTC and shFMR1. Vinculin and Coomassie staining were used as normalisers.
  Right histogram represents the quantification of the biological replicates (#148,
  #163 and #169 GSCs). Phosphorylated proteins were normalised over total protein
  levels (mean ± SEM, n = 3 different cell lines, each data point is the average of
  three independent FACS sortings, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, One-sample t-test).'
