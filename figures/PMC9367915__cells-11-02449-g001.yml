caption: Schematic representation of the DDR, Hippo and Notch signaling pathways in
  prostate cancer. (A). Mutations in DDR genes including ATM, TP53, BRCA1/2 and RAD51
  are likely implicated in prostate carcinogenesis. The DDR pathway is largely conserved
  among different types of human cancer. (B). The Hippo kinase cascade is actively
  involved in prostate cancer. One of the routes through which YAP activity may be
  affected in prostate cancer is via MST1 kinase ubiquitination and subsequent proteosomal
  degradation, elicited by the molecular chaperone HSP27. Upon MST1 degradation, YAP
  translocates to the nucleus where it resumes its transcription coregulator activity.
  ETS factors and ETS-regulated genes, such as ERG, also have an important role in
  YAP and TAZ regulation. Especially ERG, apart from regulating the expression of
  YAP1, it can also bind to YAP1/TEAD binding sites and transactivate Hippo target
  genes. (C). The Notch pathway is deeply involved in prostate tumorigenesis. When
  a Notch ligand (Delta-like 1/3/4 or Jagged-1/2) binds to Notch transmembrane receptors
  (Notch 1/2/3/4), the receptors are cleaved by members of Metalloprotease (ADAM)
  family and γ-secretase. This cleavage releases the Notch intracellular domain (NICD),
  which translocates to the nucleus, where it regulates the expression of genes including
  MYC, HES, HEY, Cyclin D, etc.
