caption: MSC and IM resistance in GIST cells in vitro. Transwell cell migration assay
  showed that MSC could migrate to GIST-882 and GIST-T1 cells in vitro (A–C). After
  mixed co-culture for 2–8 days, CM improves the survival of GIST cells under IM treatment
  (50 nM) (D–E). In contrast to the no-contact co-culture of Transwell, MSC can promote
  drug resistance only when in direct contact with GIST (F, G). Co-culture with MSC
  reduced the apoptosis rate of GIST (H, J) under IM treatment and reduced the proportion
  of G0/G1 phase cells while increasing the proportion of S phase cells (I, K). Conditioned
  medium increases the IC50 of IM on GIST cells (L). All experiments were repeated
  at least thrice. Data are means ± SEM (n = 3 in each group) *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01
