caption: OG mitigates oxidative stress of bone tissue of SAMP6 mice and osteoclast
  derived from RAW264.7 cells. (a) Representative Western blot analysis and the quantification
  of NOX1, NOX2, NOX4, and SOD2 expression in bone tissue of mice. (b) Fluorometric
  quantification of ROS production was assayed using a multifunctional microplate
  reader; (c–i) the levels of NOX1, NOX2, NOX4, HO-1, GCS, NQO1, and G6PD were detected
  by ELISA kits. Images presented are representative of ≥3 sections for each group
  or independent experiments, and each point represents mean ± SD. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P
  < 0.01 vs. the indicated group.
