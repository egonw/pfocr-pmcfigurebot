caption: A schematic summary of the degenerative NP in vitro model and the effects
  of soluble factors derived from human NP cells on microglia’s chemotaxis and activation.
  In this study, IL-1β stimulation activates the NF-κB signaling pathway on human
  NP cells, which controls the expression of inflammatory and chemotactic genes encoding
  including TNF-α, IL6, CXCL8, CCL2, CCL3 and CCL5 via nucleus translocation of NF-κB
  p65 subunit. IL-1β-stimulated human NP cells show the protein production of IL-6,
  IL-8, CCL-2, and CCL-5. Conditioned medium containing these factors induces the
  recruitment and activation of microglia. Furthermore, neutralizing CCL-2 inhibits
  this chemotaxis effect in our microfluidic platform. Together, this pathomechanism
  can provide novel therapeutic target molecules for microglia-mediated neuroinflammation
  with LBP in IVD disease.
