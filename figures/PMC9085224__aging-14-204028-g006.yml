caption: Elevation of miR-181a-5p regulated ERK-MMP pathway in ESCC through MEK1.
  (A) FISH was performed to identify the distribution and expression levels of miR-181a-5p
  in miR-181a-5p NC, miR-181a-5p mimics or inhibitor transfected ECA109 cells. The
  positive expression shows green fluorescence. The red arrows represent a tiny amount
  of fluorescence of miR-181a-5p. (B) Western blotting analysis of p-ERK1/2, p-JNK,
  p-P38, t-ERK1, MMP2 and MMP9 in miR-181a-5p NC, miR-181a-5p mimics or inhibitor
  transfected ECA109 cells. The p-ERK1/2, p-JNK, p-P38, t-ERK1, MMP2 and MMP9 protein
  levels were measured after co-transfection with miR-181a-5p mimics, miR-181a-5p
  NC or miR-181a-5p inhibitor and MEK1-OE Lentivirus in ECA109 cells. Different data
  were presented as mean Â± S.D. (all P < 0.05).
