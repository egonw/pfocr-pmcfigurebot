caption: Synthetic pathway for octadecanoid compounds included in the developed analytical
  platform. LA = linoleic acid, ALA = α-linolenic acid, GLA = γ-linolenic acid, and
  OA = oleic acid. The fatty acid substrate is indicated by color. See Table S1 for
  a list of octadecanoid nomenclature. Superscript a indicates that the 5,6-EpODEs
  (colored green) are derived from pinolenic acid (cis,cis,cis-5,9,12) and columbinic
  acid (trans,cis,cis-5,9,12), which are isomers of GLA. The asterisk indicates that
  both enantiomers are included in the SFC method based upon the availability of enantiopure
  standards. In IUPAC nomenclature, the term "oxo" is used to indicate an "=O" group
  bonded to the corresponding numbered carbon; however , in this work the colloquial
  "keto" is used (e.g., 9-keto or 9-KOTrE vs. 9-OxoOTrE).
