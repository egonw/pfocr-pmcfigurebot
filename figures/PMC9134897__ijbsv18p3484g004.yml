caption: CBX3 triggers the hyperactivation of TGF-Î² signaling pathway in pancreatic
  cancer. (A and B) GSEA indicated top 10 REACTOME signaling pathways induced by the
  overexpression of CBX3 in TCGA-PAAD dataset. Multi-GSEA plot showed running enrichment
  score for gene sets as the analyses walk down the preranked gene list (A). Ridge
  plot showed density of signaling pathway generated by using the frequency of fold
  change values per gene within each set (B). (C-F) REACTOME signaling by TGF-beta
  receptor complex was activated by the overexpression of CBX3 in TCGA-PAAD (C), ICGC-PACA-AU
  (D), ICGC-PACA-CA (E) and CPTAC-PDAC (F) datasets (all P < 0.05*).
