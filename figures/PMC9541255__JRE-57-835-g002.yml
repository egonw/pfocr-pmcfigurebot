caption: 'Li‐activated macrophages mediated osteogenic/cementogenic differentiation
  of PDLCs. (A) RT‐qPCR analysis showed upregulated gene expression levels of osteogenic
  markers (Runx2 and OCN) and cementogenic markers (CAP and CEMP1) in PDLCs on day
  3 and day 7 of stimulation with conditioned medium derived from LiCl‐activated macrophages.
  (B) Western blot analysis demonstrated a significant increase in osteogenic markers
  at the protein levels. (C) Alizarin Red S staining revealed significantly increased
  mineral depositions in PDLCs stimulated with conditioned medium derived from LiCl‐activated
  macrophages in a dose‐dependent manner. MLi0, MLi2.5, and MLi5: conditioned medium
  derived from macrophages stimulated with LiCl at a concentration of 0, 2.5, and
  5 mM, respectively. Asterisk indicates significant difference (*p < .05)'
