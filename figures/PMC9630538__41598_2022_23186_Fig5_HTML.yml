caption: 'Prodigiosin suppresses KIAA1524 transcription by disrupting the binding
  of Elk-1 to the promoter of KIAA1524. (a) Quantification of KIAA1524 mRNA level
  in LN229 cells treated with or without PG for 6 h. (b) The protein level of KIAA1524
  in LN229 cells treated with 100 µg/ml CHX with or without PG for 0 h, 3 h or 6 h.
  (c, d) Effects of PG on KIAA1524 promoter activity. LN229 cells were co-transfected
  with different promoter regions before being treated with PG. Cell lysates were
  prepared for analysis of luciferase activity. (* p < 0.05. ** p < 0.01). (e)Ectopic
  expression of ELK1 reversed the effects of PG in GBM cells: ELK1 was up-regulated
  by transfection. Cells were treated with or without PG at 100 nM for 24 h and analyzed
  by western blotting. (f) Bioinformatics correlation analysis between KIAA1524 expression
  and ELK1.'
