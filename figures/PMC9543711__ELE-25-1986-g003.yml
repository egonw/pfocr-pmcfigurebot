caption: Visual representation of the various hypotheses (via simulated data), where
  yellow indicates high growth rates and blue low growth rates. (a) Truly asynchronous
  population cycles, where each population (line) cycles independently of its neighbours.
  (b) Partial synchrony where the neighbouring populations cycle almost simultaneously,
  though they are not perfectly synchronised (decomposed into subsequent models).
  (c) Perfectly synchronised populations where all populations cycle at precisely
  the same time (where  should best be represented as varying with time only, model
  N2). (d, e, g, h, j, k) All represent the spatial patterns on a given day for the
  various parameterisations of fitted travelling wave models, described in Table .
  (f) A purely spatial pattern (where any perceived spatio‐temporal pattern is merely
  spatial, model N3, as Sherratt & Smith,  suggested may be the case for the apparent
  snowshoe hare travelling wave). (d) A single planar wave at a snapshot in time (Moss
  et al., ; Lambin et al., , Bjørnstad et al., , Berthier et al. , model P). (e) Either
  an expanding or contracting single radial travelling wave (radially expanding from
  a central location as suggested by Johnson et al.,  [model RE] or contracting as
  suggested by Sherratt & Smith, , [model RC]). (g) Two isolated planar waves separated
  by a physical feature, the Duero river (inferred from Sherratt & Smith, , model
  PF). (h) Two radial waves separated by the same physical feature but may be either
  contracting or expanding (models RFE and RFC). (j) Dual overlapping planar waves,
  which additively form a single overall pattern (model PD). (k) Either dual overlapping
  contracting or expanding radial waves, additively forming an overall pattern (models
  RDE and RDC). (i) The modelling approach of an underlying cycle manifesting itself
  in the form of partial asynchrony in the data. The graphical pathway of analysis
  for the selected model (RDE) would be b  k  i, where k  i is carried out according
  to model RDE in Table .

  speeds, best describe a self‐organised spatio‐temporal pattern in population growth
