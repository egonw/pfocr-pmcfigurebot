caption: 'The main molecular mechanisms and regulation networks of anticancer drugs
  derived from natural products. (A) Natural products inhibit cell proliferation by
  destroying the microtubule dynamic and DNA damage and inhibiting translation. (B)
  Natural products induce apoptosis via mitochondrial pathway and chromatin damage
  and by destroying the balance of HAT and HDAC. (C) Biosynthesis of doxorubicin,
  a type II polyketide []. ACP: acyl carrier protein. KS: ketosynthase. KR: ketoreductase.
  GT: glycosyltransferase. MT: methyl transferase. OA: oxygenase. ME: methyl esterase.
  (D) Natural products result in vascular shutdown via Rho pathway. ES: endoplasmic
  reticulum stress. OS: oxidative stress. HAT: histone acetylase. HDAC: histone deacetylase.
  IFP: incorrectly folded protein. TOP: topoisomerase.'
