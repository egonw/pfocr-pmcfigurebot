caption: (a) GO enrichment analysis of significant DEGs in PRCC. GO stands for Gene
  Ontology; CC is for the cellular component; MF stands for molecular function, and
  BP stands for biological mechanism. (b) The DEGs are significantly associated with
  the KEGG pathway in PRCC. (c) Protein-protein interaction network of significant
  DEGs. (d) The top 10 hub genes were selected from the original PPI network.
