caption: Proposed antidiabetic effects of NS. NS attenuates insulin secretion by ameliorating
  β cell proliferation and improves the structure of the islet of the pancreas. In
  the small intestine, NS agents delay the digestion and absorption of food because
  of the inhibitory activity of α-amylase and α-glucosidase. NS also modulate SGLT
  causing less glucose absorption in the jejunum epithelium and activating GLUT4,
  which is associated with increased glucose absorption in skeletal muscle. NS also
  alleviates insulin resistance by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which
  promotes GLUT4 biogenesis and translocation. NS also decreases hepatic gluconeogenesis
  by reducing its precursors. Besides, NS exerts a potential in scavenging , HO·,
  DPPH, and other free radicals to lighten oxidative stress, resulting in the less
  production of malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide. NS also increase the contents
  and activity of antioxidant enzymes GSHPx, SOD, and CAT. NS improves dyslipidaemia,
  which could reduce inflammatory markers, such as IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α, along with
  the reduction of apoptosis markers, such as Bax and caspase-3.
