caption: 'HT maintains mitochondrial homeostasis by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling
  pathway. Note: HNPCs were incubated for 1 h with 50 ng/mL TNF-α and 20 or 100 μM
  HT or were left untreated. (a) qRT–PCR measurement of NF-κB1 levels in each group.
  (b, c) HNPCs were cultured according to the methods described above; Western blot
  measurement of p-p65 levels was performed. (d, f) The nuclear translocation rate
  of p65 was assessed by immunofluorescence staining. Scale bars: 25 μm. (e, g). The
  expression level of p-p65 was measured using immunofluorescence staining. Scale
  bar: 50 μm. HNPCs were incubated for 48 h with 50 ng/mL TNF-α and 20 or 100 μM HT
  or were left untreated. (h, i) Endogenous ROS levels in HNPCs were measured with
  a DCFH-DA probe. Scale bar: 50 μm. (j, k) Mptps in HNPCs were assayed by Mptp assay.
  Scale bar: 50 μm. (l) Mitochondrial morphology was assessed by TEM. Scale bars:
  5 μm and 1 μm. (m, n) The mitochondrial membrane potential in HNPCs was assessed
  by JC-1 staining. Scale bar: 50 μm. (o) Flow cytometry was used to evaluate the
  apoptotic ratio of HNPCs in each group. (p) Western blot measurement of c-caspase3,
  Bax, and Bcl-2 levels in HNPCs was performed.'
