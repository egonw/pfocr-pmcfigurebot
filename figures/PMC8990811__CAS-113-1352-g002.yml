caption: Fractionated irradiation (IR) activates the immune response in cancer cells.
  (A) Time course of fractionated IR. Bright‐field images show KYSE‐450 cells before
  and after treatment with irradiation at 60 Gy/20 fractions (fr). Scale bar = 100 µm.
  (B) Biological processes activated during the clinical irradiation of KYSE‐450 cells.
  The Gene Ontology (GO) terms were enriched in differentially expressed genes as
  determined by the RNA‐sequencing of non‐IR cells and cells treated with 30 Gy/10 fr
  IR. (C) GO enrichment network of KYSE‐450 cells exposed to irritation at 30 Gy/10 fr.
  (D) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes map of cell adhesion molecule pathways
  in KYSE‐450 cells exposed to 30 Gy/10 fr. (E) Relative expression of HLA‐B, HLA‐DRB1,
  and programmed cell death‐ligand 1 (PD‐L1) during fractionated irradiation. Each
  time point was calculated as the percentage in the 30 Gy/10 fr group. APC, antigen‐presenting
  cell; DC, dendritic cell; PD‐L1, programmed cell death‐ligand 1; RT, radiotherapy
