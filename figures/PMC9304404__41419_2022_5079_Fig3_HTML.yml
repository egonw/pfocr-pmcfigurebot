figure_title: Apatinib activated alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism in NSCLC
  cells
caption: A Hierarchical clustering (heatmap) of the differentially expressed genes
  (DEGs) of A459 cells with or without apatinib treatment (20 μM, 48 h). B Gene set
  enrichment analysis (GSEA) of metabolism-related genes in the A549 cells of both
  groups. The X-axis represents the FDR statistical value (FDRq), and the Y-axis represents
  the normalized enrichment score (NES). C GSEA of alanine, aspartate, and glutamate
  metabolism-related genes. NES, normalized enrichment score; FDRq, FDR statistical
  value. D Heatmap of the relative mRNA expression of alanine, aspartate, and glutamate
  metabolism-related genes. E mRNA expression of ASNS and GLS1 from the RNA-seq data.
  F Volcano plot of the DEGs. GLS1 and ASNS were marked up. The X-axis and the Y-axis
  represents log2 (fold change) and −log10 (adjusted p value), respectively. G Protein
  and H mRNA expression levels of GLS1 and ASNS detected by WB and qRT–PCR in A549
  and H460 cells with apatinib (20 μM, 48 h) or negative control treatment. I Reaction
  catalyzed by ASNS. J Reaction catalyzed by GLS1. Data are presented as mean ± SEM
  from three independent experiments.
