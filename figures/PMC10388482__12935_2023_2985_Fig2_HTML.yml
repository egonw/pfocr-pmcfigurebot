caption: SALL4 regulates VEGF-A, B, and C expression levels. SALL4-B downregulation
  by siRNA decreases, while upregulation by over-expressing plasmid (P-SALL4-B) increases
  the expression levels of VEGF-A, B, and C in MKN-45, MGC-803, and HGC-27 cells.
  A-D qRT-PCR analysis of SALL4-B, VEGF-A, B, and C mRNA expression levels in MKN-45,
  MGC-803, and HGC-27 cells. E-H Western blot analyses for protein levels of SALL4-B,
  VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and VEGF-C in MKN-45, MGC-803, and HGC-27. GAPDH was used as a loading
  control. I-L The expression level of VEGF-A, B, and C in the CM from MKN-45, MGC-803,
  and HGC-27-si-NC/si-SALL4-B and Vector/ P-SALL4-B cells were detected by ELISA assay.
  The results are presented as the means ± standard error of mean (SEM). *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001
