caption: 'Western blotting analysis of extracellular matrix and fibrotic proteins
  in the heart tissues of control and drug-treated male Npr1 gene-disrupted mice:
  representative Western blots showing the levels of MMP-2, MMP-9, PCNA, CTGF, and
  α-SMA proteins (panels (A–E)). The densitometry analysis of proteins was normalized
  to β-actin protein levels (panels (F–J). Values are expressed as means ± S.E. (n
  = 6 animals in each group). Statistical significance is expressed as ### p < 0.001,
  vehicle-treated 0-copy and 1-copy vs. 2-copy; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, vehicle-treated
  0-copy,1-copy and 2 copy vs. drug-treated same gene copy number.'
