figure_title: Altered PI acyl chain profile blunts inflammasome activity by increasing
  NLRP3 phosphorylation
caption: (A) WT and LA-supplemented cells were either left untreated or primed with
  LPS (500 ng/ml) for 4 h followed by treatment with either ATP (5 mM) or nigericin
  (20 μM) for ~45 min. Cell lysates were collected, and protein was quantified. The
  amount of protein loaded for LA-supplemented cells was increased to normalize total
  NLRP3 levels. Cell lysates were immunoblotted for p-NLRP3, total NLRP3, and ASC.
  (B) Quantitative analysis of the WB shown in (A) by ImageJ. (C and D) Cells were
  treated with LPS and ATP and loaded as in (A). In addition, LA-supplemented cells
  were either exposed to COX2 inhibitor, NS-398 (10 μM), or PKA inhibitor, H-89 (10
  μM), for overnight. Cell lysates were immunoblotted for p-NLRP3, total NLRP3, and
  ASC. (E and F) Control WT, AA-grown cells, and LA-grown cells were either primed
  with LPS (500 ng/ml) for 4 h followed by treatment with ATP (5 mM) for ~45 min or
  primed with LPS followed by transfection with AIM2 agonist, poly(dA:dT). Caspase-Glo
  1 activity was measured in the culture supernatants. (G) Cell supernatants collected
  as in (A) were assayed for IL-18 secretion by ELISA. (H) WT, Abcb1–/–, AA-grown,
  or LA-grown cells cells were exposed to LPS + ATP followed by labeling with anti-ASC
  Ab and DAPI staining. Scale bars, 5 μm. (I) Quantitative analysis of the percentage
  of cells with ASC specks in samples treated as earlier. Each dot represents an individual
  field with at least n = 40 cells. Data shown are mean ± SEM, and the experiments
  shown are representative of at least three independent experiments with three replicates
  each. Arrowheads show ASC specks. *p < 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001,
  by Student t test. (J) Schematic for ABCB1- and PI-mediated regulation of the NLRP3
  inflammasome. ABCB1 is important in maintaining lipid metabolism. In the absence
  of ABCB1, the PI lipid chain configuration is altered, resulting in the reduced
  ratio of short-chain to long-chain fatty acids. The activation of the TLR4-dependent
  pathway relies on the adaptor protein TIRAP binding to PIP2 for precise positioning
  at the plasma membrane. However, alteration in PI-lipid profile results in at least
  two distinct outcomes, which affect both the priming and activation steps of the
  NLRP3 inflammasome. First, either due to inability to bind to PIP2 or reduced PIP2
  abundance at the PM, TIRAP is ubiquitinated and degraded in the cytoplasm. Inflammasome
  assembly requires NLRP3, ASC, and pro-caspase-1 in a complex wherein caspase-1 activation
  leads to the maturation of pro-IL-1β into the activation form. Altered PI profile
  most likely increases PGE2 secretion because of increased PI incorporation of precursor
  AA. As a result, NLRP3 is phosphorylated at the Ser291 residue, which is mediated
  by PKA signaling leading to NLRP3 inactivation. Consequently, assembly of the inflammasome
  is abrogated resulting in blunted caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion.
