caption: The establishment of IFN-γ response pathway signature and the relationship
  between EGFR pathway-related and IFN-γ response pathway prognostic gene signature.
  (A,B). LASSO coefficient profiles of IFN-γ response genes; (C). Multivariate Cox
  regression analysis of the selected genes in the TCGA set; (D,E). The combination
  of EGFR pathway-related and IFN-γ response pathway signatures can divide glioma
  samples into 4 groups with distinct prognosis in the TCGA set (D) and the CGGA set
  (E); (F,G). The relationship between the above two signatures in the TCGA set (F)
  and the CGGA set (G); (H). The majority of patients exhibit either high or low scores
  in both signatures, with only a small proportion of patients displaying a combination
  of one high and one low score in the TCGA and CGGA sets.
