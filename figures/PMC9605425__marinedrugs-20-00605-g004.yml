caption: (A) Representative Western blot images of phosphorylated IKKα/β (P-IKKα/β),
  total IKKβ and α-tubulin levels in HUVECs under indicated treatments; (B) Densitometric
  quantification of (A) and two additional independent experiments, P-IKKα/β bands
  were relativized to total IKKβ bands and normalized to TNF-α positive control; (C)
  Representative Western blot images of phosphorylated Akt (P-Akt), total Akt and
  SMC3 levels in HUVECs under indicated treatments; (D) Densitometric quantification
  of (C) and two additional independent experiments, P-Akt bands were relativized
  to total Akt bands and normalized to TNF-α positive control; in (B,D), means and
  standard deviations of three independent replicates are represented; statistical
  analyses were performed through t-tests; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.
