caption: The schema shows that EP2 receptors have a biased ability to activate the
  Gαs‐protein/cAMP‐mediated pathway, whereas EP4 receptors have biased activity for
  the Gαi‐protein/ERKs‐mediated pathway. Along with β‐catenin/TCF‐mediated signaling,
  EP2 receptors have the ability to intrinsically activate the Gαs‐protein/cAMP‐mediated
  pathway, whereas EP4 receptors have strong biased activity for the Gαi‐protein/ERKs‐mediated
  pathway.
article_title: The Gαs‐protein‐mediated pathway may be steadily stimulated by prostanoid
  EP2 receptors, but not by EP4 receptors.
