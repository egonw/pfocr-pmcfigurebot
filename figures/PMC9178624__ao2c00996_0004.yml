caption: 'Effects of endothelium and pretreatment with H2S-producing enzyme inhibitor
  on ACh-induced vasodilation in rat cerebral basilar arteries (mean ± SD, n = 6).
  (a) Role of the endothelium in ACh-induced dilation in U46619-preconstricted arteries.
  (b) Effects of pretreatment with the CSE inhibitor PPG and the 3-MST inhibitor Asp
  on dilation of ACh in U46619-preconstricted arteries with endothelium. (c) Effect
  of PPG or Asp pretreatment on ACh-induced dilation in KCl-preconstricted arteries
  with endothelium. +Endo: artery ring with endothelium, −Endo: endothelium-denuded
  artery ring, PPG: 100 μmol/L, Asp: 10 μmol/L. **P < 0.01 vs the PPS+vehicle/+Endo
  group or the PPS+vehicle group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 vs the PPS+ACh/+Endo group
  or the PPS+ACh group; ΔΔP < 0.01 vs the PPG+ACh group.'
