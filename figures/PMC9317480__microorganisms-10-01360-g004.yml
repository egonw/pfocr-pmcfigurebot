caption: 'B2 and B7 vitamins biosynthetic metabolic capabilities of the di-symbiotic
  system B. aphidicola (Ba)-S. symbiotica (Ss) in S. maydis (Sm) and P. lyropictus
  (Pl). The Buchnera APS strain forming the mono-symbiotic system (Buchnera-only)
  associated with the pea aphid A. pisum was used as a comparison. On the left are
  the names of the genes encoding the enzymes involved in the biosynthetic pathway.
  Each box is associated with the gene encoded by the genome of a symbiont. The following
  code is used to characterize the state of each gene: the blue color means that the
  gene (or an alternative gene that can perform the same enzymatic function) is present
  and not pseudogenized, the gray color indicates that the gene is missing, and the
  yellow color with the psi (Ψ) symbol means that the gene is pseudogenized (including
  its alternative(s)).'
