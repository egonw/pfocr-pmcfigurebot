caption: 'Diagram of the effects of MBE and GE on preventing CSE-induced bone cell
  damage. Both CSE and antioxidants could activate the Nrf2 signaling pathway. The
  dissociation of Keap1/Nrf 2 complexes prevents the degradation of transcription
  factor Nrf2 and, consequently, results in the activation of Nrf2. Combined with
  antioxidant response element (ARE) promoter, phosphorylated Nrf2 (p-Nrf2) triggers
  the antioxidative transcription of SOD1. Then, the antioxidative defense system
  enhances osteogenesis in the SCP-1/THP-1 co-culture system. However, the slight
  activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway by CSE could not inhibit the oxidative
  damage in osteoblasts. This led to decreased OPG secretion by osteoblasts and, thus,
  an increase in the RANKL: OPG ratio. Through the interaction between RANKL and RANK
  (RANKL receptor), increased RANKL activated the NF-κB pathway. In addition, CSE
  also upregulated the NF-κB pathway in the co-culture system. CSE promotes the expression
  of phosphorylation ERK 1/2 via the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
  ROS-induced inhibitor of kappa B kinase beta (IKKβ) results in the degradation of
  IκB-α and the activation of NF-κB. Transcriptional factor NF-κB promoted the expression
  of osteoclast-related genes and osteoclastogenesis. The black and green arrows represent
  the activity of CSE and antioxidants (MBE or GE), respectively.'
