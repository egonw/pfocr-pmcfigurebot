  between lncRNAs and the pathway. (B) Schematic of the Notch signaling pathway and
  the interactions between lncRNAs and the pathway. (C) Schematic of the NF-κB signaling
  pathway and the interactions between lncRNAs and the pathway. (D) Schematic of the
  Hedgehog signaling pathway and the interactions between lncRNAs and the pathway.
