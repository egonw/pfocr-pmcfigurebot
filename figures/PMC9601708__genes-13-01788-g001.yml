caption: The predicted targets of bta-miR-6531 are mainly involved in the calcium
  signaling pathway and the cAMP signaling pathway. (A) The expression of miR-6531
  in different motility sperms; (B) Targets of bta-miR-6531 were predicted using two
  miRNA databases. (C) The KEGG pathway enrichment of the 508 shared targets (***
  p < 0.001).
