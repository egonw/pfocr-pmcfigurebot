caption: 'Myricetin induces autophagy in the AGSgastric cancer cell. (A) The AGSgastric
  cancer cells were treated with myricetin (0, 15, and 25 μM) for 24 h, and the cells
  were harvested to measure the levels of beclin 1 and microtubule-associated protein
  LC3 proteins by western blotting. (B) The AGSgastric cancer cells were pretreated
  with 3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor (1 mM), for 1 h, followed by treatment with myricetin
  (0 and 15 μM) for 24 h. The AGSgastric cancer cell viability was measured by MTT
  assay. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD); ∗p < 0.05 vs. untreated
  control group, #p < 0.05 vs. treated myricetin group.'
