caption: Pathway analysis plot showing the impact on metabolic pathways that are significantly
  enriched (padj < 0.05) and have a pathway impact score > 0.1 per cancer type. Datapoints
  are colored according to their impact score. (A) Pathway impact according to differentially
  abundant metabolites (padj < 0.05); (B) pathway impact according to differentially
  connected metabolites (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value padj < 005).
