caption: 'TLR9 expression is increased in SAE rats. (A) The protein levels of TLR9
  in sham and CLP groups are shown, with GAPDH used as the loading control, and sham
  group is normalized. n = 5. (B) TLR9 (red) co-stains with NeuN (green) at 24 h after
  CLP. The arrowheads point to the overlap of red, green, and blue (DAPI). The IntDen
  of TLR9 was analyzed by Image J. Scale bar = 20 μm in magnified images. n = 5. Data
  are represented by histograms. ∗P < 0.05. All experiments were repeated three times
  and error bars depict mean ± standard deviation. CLP: Cecal ligation and perforation;
  SAE: Sepsis associated encephalopathy; TLR9: Toll-like receptor 9.'
article_title: A new cell death program regulated by toll-like receptor 9 through
  p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway in a neonatal rat model with
  sepsis associated encephalopathy.
