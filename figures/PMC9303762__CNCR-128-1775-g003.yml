caption: 'Cyclin‐dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) promotes tongue squamous cell carcinoma
  (TSCC) cell proliferation. (A) Right: Western blot analysis was used to detect CDK5
  expression in TSCC cell lines and in a normal oral epithelial cell line. Glyceraldehyde
  3‐phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) served as a control. Left: Western blot analysis
  revealed that CDK5 protein expression was downregulated in SCC25 and Cal27 cells
  and upregulated in SCC15 cells. GAPDH served as a control. sh‐NC indicates short
  hairpin negative control. (B) Cholecystokinin‐8 (CCK8) assays performed to detect
  TSCC cell proliferation revealed the absorbance at different time points at 450
  nm (optical density [OD] 450). (C) Cell cloning experiments demonstrated that CDK5
  overexpression promoted clone formation. (D) Cell migration experiments demonstrated
  that CDK5 overexpression promoted cell migration. (E) Flow cytometry analyses of
  the cell cycles of overexpressing CDK5 (OE‐CDK5)–treated and sh‐CDK5–treated cells
  and their respective negative control cells are illustrated. PE‐A indicates phycoerythrin
  assay; PI‐A, propidium iodide assay. (F) Xenograft tumors in nude mice after 28
  days are shown. The mean volume and weight of xenograft tumors formed by OE‐CDK5
  and sh‐CDK5 cells and their respective negative control cells are indicated. All
  data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation values. A single asterisk indicates
  P < .05; double asterisks, P < .01.'
