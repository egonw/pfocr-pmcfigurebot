caption: NiCl2 activates p38 MAPK signaling pathway in the testis and TM4 cells (a)
  Immunoblot analysis of p-p38 and p38 in the testis. (b) Quantification of p-p38/p38
  in the testis. (c) The immunoblotted for p-p38 and p38 in TM4 cells. (d) Quantification
  of p-p38/p38 in TM4 cells. (e) The immunoblotted for p-p38 and p38 in the testis
  after treatment with NiCl2 in the presence/absence of NAC. (f) Quantification of
  p-p38/p38 in the testis after treatment with NiCl2 in the presence/absence of NAC.
  (g) The immunoblotted for p-p38 and p38 in TM4 cells after treatment with NiCl2
  in the presence/absence of NAC. (h) Quantification of p-p38/p38 in TM4 cells after
  treatment with NiCl2 in the presence/absence of NAC. Data are presented with the
  means ± standard deviation (n = 8). Bars with the same letter are not significantly
  different. P < 0.05 is considered significant.
