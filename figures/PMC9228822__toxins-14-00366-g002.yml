caption: Functional analysis of DEGs between the three resistance strains and the
  susceptible SCD strain without Cry1Ac exposure. (Aâ€“F) The most significantly (p
  < 0.05) enriched 10 (Top 10) pathways for the constitutively upregulated (A,C,E)
  or downregulated (B,D,F) genes in the three resistant strains. The column indicates
  the number of DEGs related to each pathway. (G,H) Venn diagram analysis of the top
  10 pathways enriched by constitutively upregulated (G) or downregulated (H) genes
  in the three resistance strains.
