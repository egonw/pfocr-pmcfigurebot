caption: PRKCZ regulated Cdc42 to mediate EMT of HPV+ HNSCC cells. (A) The top 20
  KEGG pathways for abnormal methylation gene enrichment in Illumina methylation chip
  and PRKCZ role in Rap signaling pathway. (B) The mRNA expression changes of Epac1,
  Rac1, Rap1A, Rap1B, Cdc42, RhoA, and RhoB in HPV+ HNSCC cells after PRKCZ silencing.
  (C) The protein expression changes of Cdc42 in HPV+ HNSCC cells after PRKCZ silencing
  (include densitometry analysis of WB results). (D) The mRNA and protein expression
  (include densitometry analysis of WB results) changes of E-cadherin, N-cadherin,
  and Vimentin in HPV+ HNSCC cells after PRKCZ silencing. All assays were carried
  out in triplicate. Results were presented as means Â± SD. ns > 0.05, * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
