caption: Model for regulation of type I IFN response by G2 checkpoint arrest. Treatment
  with IR alone (top) can induce a delayed IFN response, occurring after completion
  of the IR-induced G2 checkpoint arrest. When the G2 arrest is abrogated by ATRi
  (ATRi + IR; bottom), the IFN response comes earlier, and it is also stronger (because
  more micronuclei are formed when there is less time for DNA repair prior to mitosis).
  In both cases IFN is induced due to immune recognition of DNA from ruptured micronuclei,
  via the cGAS–STING–IFN pathway. This pathway can be suppressed by treatment-induced
  caspase activation.
