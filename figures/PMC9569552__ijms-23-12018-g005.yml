caption: 'ZWB90-3-induced large vacuole formation in HCC827 and A549 cells. (A) Phase
  contrast images were taken after 72 h of ZWB90-3 or PBS treatment (vehicle) in HCC827
  and A549 cells. Images were acquired at 40× magnification. Scale bars: 50 μm. (B)
  HCC827 cells were treated with ZWB90-3 to induce vacuole formation. Confocal imaging
  was used to co-localize GFP-LAMP1, AF488-Rab7, AF488-Rab5, and cy5-LysoTracker.
  Images were acquired at 100× magnification. Scale bars: 10 μm.'
