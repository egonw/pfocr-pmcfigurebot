caption: '(A) sPD-L1 release in HR+ luminal A and TNBC patients. (A) sPD-L1 protein
  level (pg/mL) released from PBMCs of HR+ BC luminal A and TNBC patients in DMSO
  control. sPD-L1 from PBMCs of TNBC patients was significantly higher than that of
  luminal A HR+ BC patients (**** p < 0.0001). Data were analyzed using unpaired t-test.
  (B–D) TQ significantly inhibited sPD-L1 release from PBMCs of TNBC patients. ELISA
  quantified sPD-L1 protein level (pg/mL) released from PBMCs of TNBC patients treated
  with TQ concentrations (0, 20, 50, and 100 µM) for (B) 24 h, (C) 48 h, and (D) 72
  h. All experiments were performed in triplicate and data were expressed as the mean
  ± standard deviation. Statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism
  software version 9.1.1. The data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s
  multiple comparisons to compare each treated column and the DMSO control column
  (**** p value < 0.0001; *** p value < 0.001; ** p value < 0.01; * p < 0.05). TQ:
  thymoquinone, HR+: Hormone receptor-positive; TNBC: triple-negative breast cancer;
  BC: breast cancer; ns: non-significant; sPD-L1: soluble programmed death ligand
  1; PBMCs: peripheral blood mononuclear cells; DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide; ELISA: enzyme-linked
  immunosorbent assay.'
