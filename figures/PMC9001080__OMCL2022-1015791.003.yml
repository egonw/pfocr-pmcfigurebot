caption: The regulation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway in TBI. Under basal conditions
  (a), Keap1 functions as a substrate adaptor protein for Cul3 to mediate the degradation
  of Nrf2 via the UPS pathway. Under Nrf2 activation (b), the stress condition or
  the treatment of Nrf2 activators induces the dissociation of Nrf2 from Keap1 and
  leads to the accumulation of Nrf2 in the cytoplasm and the nuclear translocation
  of Nrf2. Then, Nrf2 binds to sMAF and ARE to regulate the expression of its downstream
  transcription factors including HO-1, NQO1, GST, GSH-Px, GCLC, and SOD. Then, oxidative
  damage, inflammation, neuronal apoptosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction are inhibited.
