caption: Combination treatment synergistically inhibits tumorigenesis of MA-10 cells
  in tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice. C57BL/6 mice were treated with IR (4 Gy) or cordycepin
  (20 mg/kg) alone or in combination. A. Measurement of body weight in mice 2-3 days
  per week. B. MA-10 transplanted tumor growth curves in mice. Data are presented
  as the relative tumor volume normalized to the initial tumor volume measured on
  Day 7 as a function of time after start of treatment. C. Measurement of tumor weight
  of transplanted MA-10 in mice. D. Direct observation of mice with tumors from the
  control and cordycepin, IR alone or in combination groups. E. H&E staining and immunohistochemical
  staining for analysis of Cleaved caspase 3-positive and CD31-positive cells (brown),
  Microscopic view with 200X. *P<0.05 indicates significant statistical difference
  compared to the control group.
