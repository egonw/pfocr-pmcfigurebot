caption: 'Treatment with CA and CS upregulates Keap-Nrf2 regulated genes and PRNP.
  qPCR for the expression of genes regulated by the antioxidant response Keap-Nrf2
  pathway and PRNP was performed using mRNA extracted from N2a58 (A) and N2a22L (B)
  cells treated with 0.5 × LD50 of CA or CS for 48 h and compared to non-treated control
  cells (Cntrl). 0.5 × LD50 was estimated at 14.84 μΜ for CA and 16.53 μΜ for CS for
  N2a58 and at 13.58 μΜ CA and 12.85 μΜ CS for N2a22L. Data represent means ± SD of
  three independent experiments. Stars denote statistical significance (unpaired,
  one-tailed, T-test); *: p-value < 0.05, **: p-value <0.01, ***: p-value < 0.001,
  ****: p-value < 0.0001. CA: dark grey, CS: light grey, Control: black.'
