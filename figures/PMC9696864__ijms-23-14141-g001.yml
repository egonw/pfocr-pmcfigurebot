caption: Mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) and Thermal withdrawal latency (TWL)
  in the DNP and Control groups. (A) Changes of MWT in normal and model rats. (B)
  TWL changes in the normal and model rats. The MWT and TWLs values of the DNP rats
  were significantly lower than those of the normal rats. The X-axis means the time
  of measuring behavior and drug administration, the detailed descriptions of 0, 1,
  5, 6 and 7 are given in the , and we injected the rats intraperitoneally with streptozocin
  (STZ) at the end of the fifth week; data are shown as mean ± SEM based on at least
  three independent experiments, n = 6; ** p < 0.01 versus the normal rats.
