caption: 'Integrated expression patterns in the VD: complementary expression of Shh
  and canonical Wnt pathway read-out. (A) Tcf/Lef-GFP read-out pattern and Shh expression
  in virtual sagittal sections through the diencephalon of raw OPT data. (B-D) Mapped
  data with greyscale render of the 3D model showing anatomy. (B) Virtual sagittal
  section through the 3D model emphasising the complementary expression of Tcf/Lef-GFP
  read-out pattern (green) and Shh (yellow) in the VD. (C) Thick virtual coronal section
  (288 µm) through the 3D model of mapped data again showing complementarity in the
  patterns (absence of overlap verified on serial sections). (D) Full 3D representation
  (point-cloud render). (A-D) E10.5. Scale bar in A also applies to B-D. (E) Sagittal
  sections through the VD at E10.5 showing: (i) mapped expression of all Wnt genes
  as indicated by the key; (ii) canonical Wnt read-out (Tcf/Lef-GFP, green) and Shh
  (yellow) expression on the same section; (iii) mapped expression of all Fzd genes
  as indicated by the key; (iv) Wnt occupancy; the number of Wnt genes co-expressed
  as indicated (no colour indicates that no Wnts are detected); (v) Fzd occupancy,
  with the number of Fzd genes co-expressed as indicated (no colour indicates no genes
  detected); (vi) mapped expression of Sfrp genes as indicated by key; (vii) mapped
  expression of Tcf/Lef transcription factor genes as indicated by key. (F) Sagittal
  sections through the VD at E11.5 showing (i) canonical Wnt read-out (Tcf/Lef-GFP,
  green); (ii) the number of Wnt genes co-expressed (key as in Eiv) and (iii) the
  number of Fzd genes co-expressed (key as in Ev) (no colour indicates no genes detected).
  (G) Sagittal sections through the brain at E9.5 showing (i) mapped expression of
  Wnt7a (green), (ii) mapped expression of Fzd5 (magenta) and Fzd7 (orange) and (iii)
  canonical Wnt read-out (Tcf/Lef-GFP, green). cf, cephalic flexure; hr, hypothalamic
  region; ir, infundibular recess; rp, Rathke''s pouch.'
