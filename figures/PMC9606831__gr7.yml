caption: Acetyl-CoA is required for Bmi1 induction under high glucose condition in
  PC cells. (A) Bar graphs depicting levels of intracellular acetyl-CoA and Western
  blot of ACLY protein in PC cells under different glycemic conditions. (B) Western
  blot of ACLY and Bmi1 proteins in PC cells transfected with ncRNA or ACLY siRNA.
  (C) Bar graphs depicting levels of intracellular acetyl-CoA in PC cells transfected
  with ncRNA or ACLY siRNA under high glucose or normal conditions. (D) Western blot
  of ACLY and Bmi1 proteins in PC cells transfected with ncRNA or ACLY siRNA under
  high glucose or normal conditions. (E) Western blot of histone H3ac and H4ac proteins
  in PC cells under different glycemic conditions. (F) Western blot of ACLY, histone
  H3ac, and H4ac proteins in PC cells transfected with ncRNA or ACLY siRNA under different
  glycemic conditions. (G) Bar graph depicting levels of intracellular acetyl-CoA
  in PC cells treated with acetate. (H) Western blot of histone H3ac, histone H4ac,
  and Bmi1 proteins in PC cells treated with acetate. (I) Western blot of ACLY, histone
  H3ac, histone H4ac, and Bmi1 proteins in ACLY knockdown PC cells treated with or
  without acetate. Data presented in the graphs represented means ± standard deviation
  from 3 parallel experiments. ∗∗∗P < .001; ∗∗P < .01; ∗P < .05.
