caption: MOBT downregulated MEF2c expression through the lncITPF–hnRNP L complex.
  (A) The Western blot analysis showed that lncITPF overexpression promoted the expression
  level of MEF2c. (B) The Western blot analysis showed that si-lncITPF reduced the
  expression level of MEF2c. (C) The rescue experiments discovered that overexpression
  of lncITPF reversed the MOBT function, resulting in the blockage of MEF2c expression.
  (D) The rescue experiments demonstrated that si-hnRNP L reversed the joint action
  of MOBT and overexpression of lncITPF, resulting in a repressed MEF2c level. NC
  meant the negative control, BP meant the blank plasmid, and RP meant the overexpressed
  lncITPF recombinant plasmid. Each bar represents mean ± SD, * p < 0.05.
