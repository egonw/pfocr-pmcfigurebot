caption: Association of deep learning radiomics signatures. (A) Training cohort. (B)
  Validation cohort. Distribution difference of signatures in LN status of each cohort
  (Mann-Whitney U test, * P<0.05, ** P<0.01, ***P<0.001). Model signatures were correlated
  in the training cohort, especially in the radiomics and GoogLeNetnet signatures
  (PCC, r = 0.59, P < 0.01), and also in the validation cohort (PCC, r = 0.32, P = 0.01)
article_title: Lymph node metastasis prediction and biological pathway associations
