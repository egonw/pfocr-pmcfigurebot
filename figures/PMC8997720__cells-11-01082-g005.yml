caption: Metabolic activity and cell medium ion content during erythroblast culture.
  (A) Glucose consumption is more elevated for cells at 3% O2, suggesting a switch
  to glycolytic pathway and resulting in a higher production of lactate (B). (C) The
  ratio Na+/K+ in the cell medium was higher, with two significant time points, in
  cells at 3% O2. (D) Clâˆ’ content, while remaining stable during differentiation of
  cells at 3% O2, resulted in daily increases for cells cultured at 20% O2. * = p
  < 0.05, ** = p < 0.01 and *** = p < 0.001.
