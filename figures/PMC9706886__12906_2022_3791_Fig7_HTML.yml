caption: The effect and mechanism of LE (Glycyrrhiza glabra) acting on TGF-β1-activated
  NPDFs. By inhibiting the MAPK/ERK-1/2 signaling pathway, LE prevents downstream
  α-SMA from differentiating fibroblasts into myofibroblasts and consequently impairs
  the production of ECM, including FBN and type I collagen
article_title: Nasal irrigation with licorice extract (Glycyrrhiza glabra) in treating
  nasal polyps by reducing fibroblast differentiation and extracellular matrix production
  in TGF-β1-stimulated nasal polyp-derived fibroblasts by inhibiting the MAPK/ERK-1/2
  pathway – an in vitro and in clinic study.
