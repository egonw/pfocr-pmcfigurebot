caption: 'The effect of ROCK and MLCP inhibition on fenestrations in LSEC. (A) Schematic
  presentation of the mechanism of ROCK inhibition by Y27632. MLC is partially dephosphorylated
  (faded-red colour) by direct ROCK inhibition by Y27632. Phosphorylation by MLCK
  is still possible, but MLCP cannot be phosphorylated (deactivated) by ROCK, causing
  additional dephosphorylation. (B) Representative SEM image of LSEC treated with
  10 µM Y27632+CytB. The inset highlights two groups of normal-sized and <100 nm-sized
  fenestrations. (C) Fenestration diameter distribution (fenestrations measured: ctrl-7843,
  Y27632-36358, Y27632+CytB-54492, cytB-17230). The proportion of fenestrations >200
  nm is 17%, 12%, 8%, and 11% for ctrl, Y27632, Y27632+CytB, and CytB, respectively.
  In addition, the cumulative effect of 10 µM Y27632 with CytB resulted in the formation
  of a second group of fenestrations of diameters < 100 nm. (D) A change in the porosity
  relative to the control is presented (n = 3). The ROCK inhibition resulted in a
  significant increase in porosity; the effect is cumulative with CytB. (E) A schematic
  presentation of MLCP inhibition by CalA. MLC is phosphorylated (vivid-red colour)
  by ROCK and MLCK and no dephosphorylation pathway (via MLCP) is available. (F) A
  representative SEM image of LSEC treated with 100 nM CalA+CytB. The inset highlights
  fenestrations with diameters > 500 nm (presented SEM images B and F are in the same
  scale). (G) Fenestration size distribution after MLCP inhibition (the number of
  fenestrations measured: ctrl-6157, CalA-3467, CalA+CytB-1103). The proportion of
  fenestrations > 200 nm increased with the appearance of a second peak of 206 nm.
  Pre-treatment with CytB (30 min) resulted in mean 67% (n = 3) fenestration diameter
  >200 nm. (H) Change in porosity relative to the control (n = 3). MLCP inhibition
  resulted in a significant decrease in the porosity down to zero (no fenestrations
  identified) for 100 nM; the defenestrating effect of CalA is partially reduced by
  30 min pre-treatment with CytB. (I) Fluorescence signal for pMLC and ppMLC measured
  using SIM for individual well-spread (fenestrated) LSEC. * p < 0.01, relative to
  control. The mean porosity of the control varied from 5.5% to 7.5%.'
