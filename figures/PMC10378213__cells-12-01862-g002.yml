caption: 'T. gondii ROP16 inhibits the activation of cGAS-STING signaling. RAW264.7
  cells (1 × 106 cells in 300 μL of opti-MEM) were co-transfected with cGAS (3 μg)
  and the indicated amounts of ROP16-encoding plasmids. Empty vectors were added to
  the cocktail to equalize the total amount of plasmid in each group. The cells were
  harvested for qRT-PCR and Western blotting 24 h and 48 h post-transfection, respectively:
  (A) the transfected RAW264.7 cells were lysed and analyzed using Western blotting;
  (B) ImageJ densitometry analysis was performed for pTBK1 relative to total TBK1
  and (C) pIRF3 relative to total IRF3; (D–F) the transcription levels of IFN-β, IL-12b,
  and CXCL10 were quantified relative to that in empty vector-transfected RAW264.7
  cells using qRT-PCR; (G) the expression of cGAS or STING was detected in RAW264.7,
  RAW-KO-cGAS, and RAW-KO-STING cells using Western blotting; (H–J) the transcription
  levels of IFN-β, IL-6, and ISG15 in RAW264.7, RAW-KO-cGAS, and RAW-KO-STING cells
  were quantified relative to that in empty vector-transfected RAW264.7 cells using
  qRT-PCR; (K–M) the activation of cGAS-STING signaling in RAW264.7 and RAW-KO-cGAS
  cells was detected using Western blotting. − un-added, + added, and ++ double. Data
  are presented as the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments. Statistical analysis
  was performed using Student’s t-test.'
