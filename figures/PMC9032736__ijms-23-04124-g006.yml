caption: Pathway of miRNAs involved in abnormal temperature stress response in plants.
  MiR160, miR393, miR159, miR319, miR156, miR398, miR166/169 regulate heat stress
  responses in plants through the hormone/development/alternative splicing/ROS/HSPs
  and HSFs-related pathways. MiR319b, miR156, miR394, miR169, miR167, and miR408 also
  regulate cold stress responses in plants with their targets.
