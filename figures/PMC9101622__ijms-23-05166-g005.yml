caption: Differentially expressed gene identification and functional and pathway enrichment
  analysis of distinct immune cells. (A) Heat map of the top featured marker genes
  for distinct immune cell types. (FDR < 0.05, logFC > 1) (B) Heat map of the enriched
  functional and signaling pathways of differentially expressed genes between SLE
  group and HC group in distinct immune cell types. The heat map cells are colored
  according to the p-value of the enriched terms, and white cells indicate a lack
  of enrichment for that term. (C) The Circos plot shows how differentially expressed
  genes between SLE group and HC group from the given immune cell types overlap. Each
  arc represents each gene list’s identity. Purple lines link the same gene that is
  shared by multiple gene lists. Blue lines link the different genes where they fall
  into the same ontological term (the term needs to be statistically significantly
  enriched with a size no larger than 100). (D) The Circos plot shows how differentially
  expressed genes between RA group and HC group from the given immune cell types overlap.
  (E) Heat map of the enriched functional and signaling pathways of differentially
  expressed genes between RA group and HC group in distinct immune cell types.
