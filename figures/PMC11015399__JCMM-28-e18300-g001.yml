caption: Functions of the Hippo pathway in mammalian eye diseases. Summary of eye
  diseases caused by dysregulation of the Hippo pathway. The components within the
  dotted rectangle indicate components of the canonical kinase cascade. Dysregulation
  of the Hippo pathway has been found in a variety of eye diseases and is involved
  in the regulation of the occurrence or progression of these diseases. Specific functions
  are shown in boxes. MAP4Ks, mitogen‐activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinases;
  NDR1/2, nuclear Dbf2‐related1/2; NF2, neurofibromin 2; GPCRs, G protein‐coupled
  receptors; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; MST1/2, sterility 20‐like protein kinase1/2;
  SAV1, Salvador 1; MOB1, MOB kinase activator 1; LATS1/2, large tumour suppressor
  1/2; YAP, yes‐associated protein; TAZ, transcriptional coactivator with a PDZ‐binding
  motif; TEADs, TEA domain DNA‐binding family members; CTGF, connective tissue growth
  factor; AP‐1, activator protein 1; DR, diabetic retinopathy; PVR, proliferative
  vitreoretinopathy; AMD, age‐related macular degeneration; RB, retinoblastoma; UM,
  uveal melanoma; EMT, epithelial‐mesenchymal transition; EndMT, endothelial‐mesenchymal
  transition; ECM, extracellular matrix; RSLC, retinoblastoma stem‐like cells.
