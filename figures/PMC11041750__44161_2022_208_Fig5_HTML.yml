figure_title: Enriched interaction pathways between CD4+ Teff cells and TREMhi macrophages
caption: Heat maps displaying outgoing (ligand) (a) and incoming (receptor) (b) signalling
  patterns of pathways describing potential ligandâ€“receptor interactions. Scale above
  the heat map indicates the relative signalling strength of a cell cluster based
  on all signalling pathways displayed in the heat map. Grey bars to the right of
  the heat map show the total signalling strength of a pathway in all cell clusters.
  The relative signalling strength is indicated by ranging colour from white (low)
  to green (high). All cells included in these graphs originate from the plaque.
