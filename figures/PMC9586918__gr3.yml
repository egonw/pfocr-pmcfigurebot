caption: Functional modules, biological processes and pathways of the association
  network of differentially co-expressed genes. The heading above each module is the
  first ranked KEGG pathway associated with that module. The border color of nodes
  is set according to the differential expression of genes in CSCs compared with GTCs;
  grey color indicates genes with no significant differential expression, red color
  is indicative of overexpression, and blue color represents under-expressed genes.
  The shape of nodes is illustrative of differential expression type of genes; diamond
  nodes indicate genes that are commonly differentially expressed in AML CSCs and
  TCGA HTCs with the same direction of differential expression, rectangle nodes shows
  genes that are uniquely differentially expressed in CSCs, and circle nodes indicate
  nodes that are not significantly differentially expressed between CSCs and GTCs.
  It should also be noted that the genes that are commonly differentially expressed
  in CSCs and TCGA HTCs with opposite directions of differential expression were also
  considered as genes with no significant differential expression. The colors of each
  node correspond to the GO-BP terms they are associated with according to the over-representation
  analysis. However, nodes with light blue color indicate nodes with no association
  with any of the selected GO-BP terms. The edge line shape corresponds to the type
  of connection; the solid line is indicative of co-expression, while, sinewave lines
  demonstrate PPI between nodes. CEGs, CSC, GTC, HTC, and GO-BP are abbreviations
  of co-expressed genes, cancer stem cell, general tumor cell, heterogenous tumor
  cell, and gene-set enrichment analysis, respectively. All of the non-modulated nodes,
  as well as modules with less than 10 nodes, are not shown in the network. Nodes
  of each module are sorted according to their degrees.
