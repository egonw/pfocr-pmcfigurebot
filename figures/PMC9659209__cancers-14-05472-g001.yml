caption: Role of HDAC1 in different signaling pathways involved in GC progression.
  HDAC1 promotes GC cell proliferation via lncRNA HRCEG repression, lncRNAs BC01600
  and AF116637 upregulation, or MORC2/p21 pathway. HDAC1 favors metastatic abilities
  of GC cells through miR-34a repression inducing CD44 expression. HDAC1 promotes
  HIF-1Î± activity leading to glycolysis in GC cells. HDAC1 inhibits CRADD transcription
  and consequently caspase-2-dependent apoptosis. HDAC1 is a resistance factor to
  chemotherapies in GC such as anthracycline, via repression of CITED2, and doxorubicin,
  inhibiting its fixation on DNA. Figure has been generated using Biorender (Biorender.com).
