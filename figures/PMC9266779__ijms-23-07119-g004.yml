caption: 'Shear stress attenuated CD4 T cell proliferation and promoted Treg differentiation.
  All hPDLSC-derived conditioned media were indirectly co-cultured with CD4 T cells.
  The proliferation of CD4 T cells was assessed using a resazurin assay. SS-CM decreased
  the percentage of T cell proliferation (A). The mRNA expressions of FOXP3 (B) and
  IL-10 (C) were upregulated in SS-CM-treated CD4 T cells. The flow cytometry analysis
  showed an increase in the percentage of CD4CD25CD127 Treg population in SS-CM compared
  to CTL-CM and activated T cells (D,E). $ p < 0.05 vs. T cell alone group, * p <
  0.05 vs. activated T cells group, # p < 0.05 vs. CTL-CM group.'
