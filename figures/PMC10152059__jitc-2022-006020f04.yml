caption: YY1 increased M2 macrophage-induced PCa malignancy. (A) The migration of
  prostate cancer cells DU145 was increased when treated with conditioned medium (CM)
  from M2 macrophages compared with treatment with M0 CM. (B–F) The migration (B)
  and proliferation (C) of DU145 cells was increased on treatment with the CM of YY1
  overexpressed M2 macrophages, while there is a decrease in the migration (D), proliferation
  (E), and colony formation (F) of DU145 cells on treatment with the CM of YY1 knocked
  down M2 macrophages. (G) Primary cancer cells from patients with prostate tumor
  were co-cultured with CM from peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)–derived macrophages,
  and representative images displayed the increasing sphere formation ability in those
  cultured with oe-YY1 PBMC-derived macrophage CM. (H) RM-1 cells mixed with oe-YY1
  M2 macrophages (M2 RAW264 cells) or control M2 RAW264 cells were subcutaneously
  injected into the backs of C57BL/6 mice, and tumor volume was examined during the
  next 4 weeks. Scale bar, 50 µm. (I) RM-1 cells mixed with oe-YY1 M2 RAW264 cells
  or control M2 RAW264 cells were injected into the caudal vein of C57BL/6 mice, and
  pulmonary metastasis nodules were counted after 6 weeks. Arrow directed to the representative
  nodules. (J, K) Gene Ontology and gene set enrichment analyses displayed that the
  upregulated genes in LNCaP cells treated with oe-YY1 M2 macrophage CM were enriched
  in the NF-κB and JAK-STAT pathway components. (L) The expression of p-STAT3 and
  p65 in LNCaP cells treated with oe-YY1 M2 macrophage CM was increased as shown by
  western blot. *p<0.05.
