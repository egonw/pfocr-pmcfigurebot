caption: 'IAL treatment inhibits microglial inflammation by activating the AKT/Nrf2/HO-1
  signaling pathway and inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway. (A–D) The effect of
  IAL on the AKT/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in BV2 cells was examined with the Western blot
  method. (E–H) The effect of IAL on the NF-κB pathway in LPS-exposed BV2 cells was
  examined with the Western blot method. (I–L) After pretreatment of cells with MK2206,
  RA and SnPP, the effect of IAL on the mediators was examined using the real-time
  PCR method. Results are shown as means ± SEM (n = 3). #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, * p
  < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001 stand for biologically significant differences.'
