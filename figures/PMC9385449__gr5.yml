caption: Expression variations in seven critical genes in cAMP-PKA pathway during
  hypo-salinity stress. Expression levels of the selected genes were normalized to
  EF1α expression level. Data are means (±SE) of three replicates. Different letters
  above the bars indicate significant difference in gene expression between groups
  (P < 0.05).

  to hypo-salinity stress and osmoregulatory role of cAMP-PKA pathway in Mercenaria
  mercenaria.
