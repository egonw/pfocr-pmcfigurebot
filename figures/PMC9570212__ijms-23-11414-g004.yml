caption: PAUF’s impacts on pancreatic cancer cell migration and invasion are exclusively
  dependent on TLR4. Migration of Panc-1_Mock and Panc-1_TLR4OE were estimated using
  transwell assays after treatment of (A) recombinant PAUF (rPAUF, 0.5 μg/mL) or (B)
  PAUF antibody (α-PAUF, 20 μg/ml) for 24 h. (C) Invasion of Panc-1_Mock and Panc-1_TLR4OE
  were determined using transwell assays after treatment of rPAUF (0.5 μg/mL) or α-PAUF
  (20 μg/ml) for 24 h. (D) Migration of pancreatic cancer cells induced by rPAUF in
  presence or absence of TAK-242, a TLR4 inhibitor. Data are represented as mean ±
  SD from multiple replicates. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001
  were obtained from two-way ANOVA and post-hoc multiple comparisons with Bonferroni
  correction. Scale bars, 50 μm.
