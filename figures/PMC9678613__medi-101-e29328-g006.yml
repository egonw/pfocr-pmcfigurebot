caption: Effect of baicalin treatment on the expression of lncRNA-MALAT1 and miR-200c
  in MDA-MB-231 cells. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations
  of baicalin for 24 h. (A) The expression of lncRNA-MALAT1 was determined by qPCR
  analysis. GAPDH was used as an internal control. The expression of lncRNA-MALAT1
  in untreated cells was set as 1. Results are presented as mean ± standard deviation,
  *P < .05 vs untreated cells. (B) The expression of miR-200c was determined by qPCR
  analysis. U6 was used as an internal control. The expression of miR-200c in untreated
  cells was set as 1. Results are presented as mean ± standard deviation, *P < .05
  vs untreated cells.
