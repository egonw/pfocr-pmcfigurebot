caption: Targeting PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in patient-derived cells. (a) Genomic alterations
  in PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, ER and cell cycle genes in PDXs. (b) Isolation of PDCs
  and ex vivo culture. (c) Sensitivity to tamoxifen and palbociclib. PDCs were treated
  with tamoxifen (0.1 μM), palbociclib (0.5 μM) or vehicle for 7 days. Waterfall plots
  represent the response of each PDC to treatment. The average area of treated spheres
  was relativized to the area of the control spheres (vehicle). PDCs were grouped
  as sensitive if significant differences in sphere area compared to their respective
  control were found; otherwise, they were classified as resistant. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ****p < 0.0001. Data represent mean ± SD, one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test
  (independent replicates n = 2, with 2 experimental replicates in each group). (d)
  Activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and expression of cell cycle proteins. Protein
  lysates from PDCs were analyzed by immunoblot with the indicated antibodies. PDCs
  harboring alterations in PIK3CA (red box), did not necessarily exhibit higher AKT
  or S6 phosphorylation levels. Tamoxifen-resistant PDCs showed an upward trend in
  cyclin E2 expression (blue box). Bands were quantified by densitometry and relativized
  to their loading control (bar graph). Data represent mean ± SD, two-sided Student’s
  t-test. (e) Sensitivity to alpelisib and everolimus. PDCs were treated with alpelisib
  (1 μM), everolimus (0.1 μM) or vehicle for 7 days. Waterfall plots represent the
  response of each PDC to treatment. The average area of treated spheres was relativized
  to the area of the control spheres (vehicle). PDCs were grouped as sensitive if
  significant differences in sphere area compared to their respective control were
  found; otherwise, they were classified as resistant. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001,
  ****p < 0.0001. Data represent mean ± SD, one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test
  (independent replicates n = 2, with 2 experimental replicates in each group). (f)
  Genomic alterations in PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Alpelisib-resistant PDCs (474 and
  313) presented PIK3CA-wt, while four out of seven  alpelisib-sensitive PDCs harbored
  alterations in PIK3CA. All PDCs were sensitive to everolimus regardless of the presence
  of alterations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. (g) Combined treatment with palbociclib,
  alpelisib/everolimus and fulvestrant. PDCs were treated with tamoxifen (0.1 µM),
  fulvestrant (0.1 µM), palbociclib (0.5 µM), alpelisib (1 µM), everolimus (0.1 µM)
  and their combinations for 7 days (sensitivity analysis, top panels) or 30 h (western
  blot, bottom panels). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001. Data
  represent mean ± SD, one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test (independent replicates
  n = 2, with 2 experimental replicates in each group). Original blots/gels are presented
  in Supplementary Material, unprocessed western blots section.
