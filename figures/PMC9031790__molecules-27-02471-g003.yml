caption: The schematic representation showing luteolin exerting its anticancer activity
  in NCI-H460 cells through the ER stress pathway. Luteolin increases ER stress expression-related
  proteins such as CHOP and p-eIF2α. As the cells were treated with eIF2α siRNA, the
  expression of CHOP and p-eIF2α was remarkably reduced, which prevented the apoptotic
  activity of luteolin, clearly suggesting the involvement of ER stress in apoptosis
  after luteolin treatment. Luteolin also stimulates Bax, Bad, and Bcl2, in turn activating
  caspase-3 and 9, leading to apoptosis (cell death).
