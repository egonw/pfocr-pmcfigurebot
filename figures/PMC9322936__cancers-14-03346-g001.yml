caption: Identification of DEGs using mRNA microarray data analysis and GO/KEGG enrichment
  analysis. (A) Boxplots of RLE indicate the normalized raw data of microarray gene
  expression datasets. (B) Volcano plot distribution of all DEGs, with red points
  for the screened upregulated DEGs and green points for the screened downregulated
  DEGs. (Câ€“E) Bubble chart visualization for GO analysis of all DGEs in NB cells and
  non-malignant cells. GO BP analysis (C), GO CC analysis (D) and GO MF analysis (E).
  (F) KEGG pathway analysis of unique DEGs in NB cells and non-malignant cells. (G)
  Hierarchical clustering analysis (heatmap) of 51 DEGs overlapping between PI3K-Akt
  pathways and pathways in cancer.
