caption: Acetate and propionate prevent myofibroblast transition from cardiac fibroblasts
  through G-protein coupled receptor 41 and 43. A, Immunofluorescent staining of vimentin
  and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression in mouse primary cardiac fibroblasts
  treated with acetate (C2) and propionate (C3) alone or in combination (C2+C3) to
  identify myofibroblast formation induced by transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1).
  Scale bar, 50 µm. B and C, Representative flow cytometry results of cardiac fibroblasts
  expressing vimentin and α-SMA (B) and quantification of vimentin and α-SMA double-positive
  cells (C). D and E, Representative images of collagen gels for assessing cardiac
  fibroblast contractility (D) and quantification of gel area (E). F and G, Representative
  images of Western blot performed to identify collagen formation with TGF-β1 fibrogenic
  stimulus in cardiac fibroblasts treated with C2 and C3 (F) and quantification of
  collagen expression (G). H through M, Western blotting of proteins involved in the
  TGF-β1-induced fibrogenesis pathway in GPR41 and GPR43 double knockdown cardiac
  fibroblasts (H) with quantification of GAPR41 (I), GPR43 (J), p-SMAD2 (K), α-SMA
  (L), and COL1A1 (M) protein expression. Statistical significance was determined
  by ordinary one-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparisons test in C, E, G, I, J,
  K, L, and M. ns, not significant; *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; ****,
  P < 0.0001.
