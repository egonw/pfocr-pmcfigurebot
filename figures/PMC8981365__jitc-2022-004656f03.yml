caption: Comparison of expression of immune-related genes between responding and non-responding
  lesions. (A–B) Expression of immune-related genes per pretreatment sample of response
  and non-response groups. In the heatmap (A), red indicates an increased gene expression
  and blue indicates a decreased gene expression. (C–D) GO (C) and Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (D) pathway analysis of the pretreatment samples. The count
  represents the number of genes in each pathway and dot size corresponds to ‘count’.
