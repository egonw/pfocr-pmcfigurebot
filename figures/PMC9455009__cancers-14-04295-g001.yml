caption: Key programmed necrosis pathways. The classical necroptotic pathway is activated
  by TNF stimulation. TNF binds to TNFR1 and leads to the formation of complex I.
  In the absence of caspase 8 activity, RIP1 interacts with RIPK3, FADD and MLKL to
  form complex IIb, which mediates necroptosis. Pyroptosis has been considered as
  gasdermin-mediated necrosis. Endogenous caspases and lymphocyte-derived Granzyme
  A/Granzyme B are able to cleave and activate individual gasdermins (GSDM) which
  further triggers pyroptosis. Ferroptosis is a failsafe rather than a typical cell
  death pathway. GPX4 and FSP1 prevent lipid peroxidation which is key to drive ferroptosis.
