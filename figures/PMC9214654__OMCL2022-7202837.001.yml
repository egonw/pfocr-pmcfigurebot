caption: 'The dysfunctions of preeclamptic PMSCs and their detrimental effects on
  trophoblasts and HUVECs. (a) The proliferation of normal PMSCs and preeclamptic
  PMSCs using CCK-8 assays. (b) The apoptotic rates of normal PMSCs and preeclamptic
  PMSCs using flow cytometry assays. (c) The cell cycle phases of normal PMSCs and
  preeclamptic PMSCs were determined using flow cytometry assays. (d) Western blot
  analysis and densitometric quantification of p16 and p53 protein expressions in
  the normal PMSCs and preeclamptic PMSCs. (e) SA-β-gal staining of PMSCs and the
  average ratio of SA-β-gal-positive cells in the normal PMSCs and preeclamptic PMSCs.
  (f) Representative Transwell photos of PMSCs as well as the relative PMSCs number
  of the Transwell quantified. (g) Western blot analysis and densitometric quantification
  of MMP9 protein expression in the normal PMSCs and preeclamptic PMSCs. (h) ELISA
  analysis of MMP9 concentrations of cell culture medium in the preeclamptic and normal
  PMSCs. (i) Representative Transwell photos and cell number of the migrated HTR-8/Svneo
  cells in different groups. (j) Representative Transwell photos and cell number of
  the invasive HTR-8/Svneo cells in different groups. (k) Representative Transwell
  photos and the cell number of the HUVEC migration in different groups. (l) ELISA
  analysis of sFlt-1 concentrations of cell culture medium in the preeclamptic and
  normal PMSCs. (m) Tube formation of HUVECs and the total length of the formative
  tube in different groups. Scale bar: 200 μm. Data are presented as the mean ± SD.
