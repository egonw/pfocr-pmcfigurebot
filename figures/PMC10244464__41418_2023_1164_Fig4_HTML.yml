figure_title: TRAF2 promotes K63-linked polyubiquitination of p62 at K420 residue
  and lysosome-dependent degradation
caption: A, B p62 half-life. HCC cells and Traf2-deletion MEF cells were treated with
  CHX (100 μg/ml) for indicated time periods. C TRAF2 promotes ubiquitination of p62
  rely on RING domain. D MEF cells with CHX (100 μg/ml) were treated with MG132(20 μM),
  CQ (50 μM), and MG132 with CQ separately for indicated time periods. E, F TRAF2
  promotes K63 polyubiquitination of p62 at K420site. G HepG2 cells were transfected
  with FLAG-tagged p62 plasmid or mutant forms, then treated with CHX (100 μg/ml)
  for indicated time periods, following IB with FLAG and ACTIN Abs.
article_title: The TRAF2-p62 axis promotes proliferation and survival of liver cancer
  by activating mTORC1 pathway.
