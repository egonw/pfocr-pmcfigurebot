caption: MBNL1-AS1 is involved in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and its expression
  is downregulated in CRC tissues and cell lines. (A) Pathway enrichment analysis
  in CRC and normal tissues based on the TCGA database. (B) Enrichment Pathway Analysis
  revealed that MBNL1-AS1 was associated with the Calcium, cAMP and PI3K-AKT signaling
  pathways. (C) MBNL1-AS1 expression in 620 human CRC tissues and 830 normal tissues
  based on the TCGA database. (D-F) MBNL1-AS1 expression in CRC tissues with TNM staging,
  lymph-node metastasis, or distal metastasis. ****P<0.0001. MBNL1-AS1, muscle blind
  like splicing regulator 1 antisense RNA 1; CRC, colorectal cancer; TCGA, The Cancer
  Genome Atlas.
