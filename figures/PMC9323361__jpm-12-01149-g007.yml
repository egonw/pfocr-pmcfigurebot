caption: Schematic diagram of a putative signaling pathway in cardiomyocytes with
  LMNA mutation. Factors like age or stimulants affect the gene expression of LMNA
  mutant cells. Dysregulation of gene expression from mutant alleles causes higher
  activation of the mTOR signaling pathway. This dysregulation causes protein translation
  imbalance, lamin disorganization, and nuclear blebbing and adds to the disease phenotype.
  mTOR-inhibitor rapamycin is effective in checking the cellular effects of LMNA mutation.
