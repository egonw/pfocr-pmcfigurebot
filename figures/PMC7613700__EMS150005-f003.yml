figure_title: PB signaling responses to APRIL
caption: (A) Time course of ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced after stimulation of day
  7 PBs with APRIL. Upper panel shows detection of phospho-ERK1/2 (p-ERK) after stimulation
  with APRIL for the indicated time points of t= 0 (unstimulated), 5, 15, 30, 60,
  120, 240 and 360 minutes. Total ERK1/2 loading control is shown below. (B) Time
  course of p38 phosphorylation induced by APRIL. Upper panel show detection of phospho-p38
  (p-p38) after stimulation with APRIL for the time course as in (A). Total p38 loading
  control is shown below. (C) Time course of JNK phosphorylation induced by APRIL.
  Upper panel show detection of phospho-JNK1/2 (p-JNK) after stimulation with APRIL
  for the time course as in (A). Total JNK loading control is shown below. Western
  blots shown in (A-C) are representative of 6 donors. (D) Time course of IκBα phosphorylation
  after stimulation of day 7 PBs with APRIL. Upper panel phospho-IκBα (p-IκBα) lower
  panel total IκBα after stimulation with APRIL for the indicated time points of t=0
  (unstimulated) 5, 15 and 30 minutes. Data representative of 4 donors. (E) Nuclear
  localisation of RELA following APRIL stimulation. Nuclear fractions separated from
  unstimulated PBs at day 7 (t=0) or stimulated with APRIL 15, 30, 60, 120, 240 and
  360 minutes, immunoblot for p65/RELA (upper panel) or Histone H3 (lower panel).
  Data are representative of 4 donors. (F, G and H) Activation of AKT/FOXO1 pathway
  after APRIL stimulation. Day 7 PB were unstimulated (t=0) or stimulated with APRIL
  for 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240 and 360 minutes. Samples were probed for (F) AKT phospho-serine
  473 (p-AKT S473) and total AKT; and (G) AKT phospho-threonine 308 (p-AKT T308) and
  total AKT; and (H) FOXO1 phospho-threonine 24 (p-FOXO1 T24) and total FOXO1 as indicated.
  Data representative of 4 donors (F, G & H). (I) Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts
  (C and N above the lanes) from unstimulated (t=0) PBs at day 7 or treated with APRIL
  for 120, 240 or 360 minutes were blotted for FOXO1 (upper panel), FOXO3 (middle
  panel) and TUBULIN (lower panel). Data representative of 4 donors.
