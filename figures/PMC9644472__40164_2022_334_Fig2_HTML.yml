caption: 'Dectin-3 mediates C. tropicalis-induced glycolysis activation in MDSCs.
  A Heatmaps showing the upregulation of metabolites of the glucose metabolism in
  MDSCs treated with C. tropicalis (MOI = 1) for 24 h (n = 5). B Metabolic pathway
  enrichment analysis shows the pathways with the significant change. C WT MDSCs were
  stimulated with heat-inactivated C. tropicalis (MOI = 1) for 24 h. The mRNA expression
  of glycolytic enzymes was measured by q-PCR. D WT and Clec4d−/− MDSCs were stimulated
  with heat-inactivated C. tropicalis (MOI = 1) for 48 h. Cell lysates were analyzed
  by immunoblotting for glycolytic enzymes. E WT MDSCs were stimulated with heat-inactivated
  C. tropicalis (MOI = 5) for 24 and 48 h. Lactate secretion by MDSCs were determined
  by lactate assay kit. F WT and Clec4d−/− MDSCs were stimulated with heat-inactivated
  C.tropicalis (MOI = 5) for 48 h. Lactate secretion and glucose consumption by MDSCs
  were determined by lactate and glucose assay kit. G WT and Clec4d−/− MDSCs were
  stimulated with or without C.tropicalis (MOI = 2), then the ECAR level of these
  cells was measured by Agilent Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer. H WT and Clec4d−/− MDSCs
  were stimulated with heat-inactivated C. tropicalis (MOI = 1) for 6 h. Hif-1α mRNA
  expression were measured by q-PCR. WT and Clec4d−/− MDSCs were stimulated with heat-inactivated
  C. tropicalis (MOI = 2) for 42 h. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting for
  HIF-1α. The results shown here are expressed as the mean ± SEM. Each panel is a
  representative experiment of at least three independent biological replicates. *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. The following statistical analyses were performed: unpaired
  Student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA where appropriate'
