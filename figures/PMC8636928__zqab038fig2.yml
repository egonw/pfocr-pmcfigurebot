caption: Interstitial CpG promoter region DNA methylation changes in response to progressive
  weighted wheel running (PoWeR). (A) Pathway analysis of hypomethylated promoters
  in interstitial nuclei after PoWeR (relative to 6M UT). (B) Interstitial nuclear
  genes with a hypomethylated promoter CpG in the fatty acid (FA) metabolism signaling
  pathway after PoWeR (FDR < 0.05). (C) Interstitial nuclear genes with a hypomethylated
  promoter CpG in the Ub-C terminal hydrosylase (UCH) proteinases pathway after PoWeR
  (FDR < 0.05). (D) Interstitial nuclear genes with a hypomethylated promoter CpG
  in the mRNA Processing pathway after PoWeR (FDR < 0.05). (E) Pathway analysis of
  hypermethylated promoters in interstitial nuclei after PoWeR (relative to 6M UT).
  (F) Interstitial nuclear genes with a hypomethylated promoter CpG in the Cancer
  and Wnt signaling pathways after PoWeR (FDR < 0.05).
