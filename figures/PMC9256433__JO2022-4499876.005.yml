caption: 'WWC2 regulates actin dynamics and impedes cervical cancer metastasis through
  the Hippo-YAP pathway. (a) Immunohistochemical detection of YAP expression in human
  cervical cancer tissues and normal cervical tissues, scale bar: 50 μm. (b) RT-qPCR
  determination of WWC2 and YAP mRNA expression in C33A cells after WWC2 or YAP silencing.
  (c) Western blot assay of WWC2 and YAP expression and the level of YAP phosphorylation
  in C33A cells after WWC2 or YAP silencing. (d) RT-qPCR determination of CTGF and
  Cyr61 mRNA expression in C33A cells after WWC2 or YAP silencing. (e) Western blot
  assay of cofilin, p-cofilin, F-actin, and G-actin expression in C33A cells after
  WWC2 or YAP silencing. (f) Phalloidin staining of the cytoskeleton of C33A cells
  after WWC2 or YAP silencing, scale bar: 25 μm. (g) Transwell assay of the invasion
  and migration of C33A cells after WWC2 or YAP silencing. (h) The adhesion of C33A
  cells to the extracellular matrix after WWC2 or YAP silencing. (i) TUNEL staining
  for apoptosis of C33A cells after WWC2 or YAP silencing. (j) Western blot assay
  of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and Vimentin protein expression in C33A cells after WWC2
  or YAP silencing. The data in the figure were measurement data and expressed as
  mean ± standard deviation. The comparison among multiple groups was performed by
  a one-way analysis of variance (Dunnett''s post hoc test). ∗p < 0.05. Cell experiments
  were repeated 3 times independently.'
