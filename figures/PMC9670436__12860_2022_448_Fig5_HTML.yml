caption: Knockdown of RPL5 inhibits the migration capability of human colon cancer
  cells. A Wound healing assay demonstrated a significant decrease in the number of
  migration cells in siRPL5–1- and siRPL5–2-transfected human colon cancer cells compared
  with that observed in siNC-transfected cells. Scale bar, 100 μm. B The levels of
  MMP2 and MMP9 were detected using western blotting. The band intensities of MMP2
  and MMP9 protein were quantified relative to β-Tubulin and normalized to the siNC
  sample. The blots were cut prior to hybridization with antibodies during blotting.
  All experiments were repeated three independent times with reproducible results.
