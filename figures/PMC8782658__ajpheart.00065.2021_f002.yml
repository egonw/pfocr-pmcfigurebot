caption: 'S-nitrosylation regulates early PMN adhesion induced by TNF-α in vitro.
  A: confluent monolayers of EAhy926 cells were incubated with 1 nM TNF-α for 5 and
  15 min. Then, isolated human preactivated PMNs were added to the monolayers and
  allowed to adhere for 30 min at 37°C. Nonadherent PMN were washed away and MPO activity
  was assayed in the cell lysates. One-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison test.
  *P < 0.05 compared with time 0. n = 8 independent experiments. Confluent monolayers
  of EAhy926 cells were preincubated with 300 µM l-NMA for 45 min or 10 µM ODQ for
  10 min before TNF-α treatment for 5 (B) and 15 min (C). Increase in leukocyte adhesion
  induced by TNF-α was blocked by inhibition of eNOS with l-NMA but not by inhibition
  of GC-1-PKG with ODQ. One-way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test. *P
  < 0.05 compared with time 0; #P < 0.05 compared with TNF-α treatment. n = 6 independent
  experiments. D: confluent monolayers of EAhy926 cells were preincubated with 300
  µM l-NMA for 45 min or 10 µM ODQ for 10 min. Neither agent caused leukocyte adhesion.
  One-way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test. n = 8 independent experiments.
  All data were normalized to adhesion seen at time 0. E: TNF-α significantly increases
  phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1177 at 5 and 15 min. One-way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s
  multiple comparison test. *P < 0.05; n = 3 independent experiments. F: real-time
  detection of NO induced by TNF-α in live EAHy926 cells. Paired t test. ****P < 0.0001;
  n = 5 independent experiments. G: representative image of one experiment showing
  the increases in NO levels in the time after TNF-α application. eNOS, endothelial
  nitric oxide synthase; l-NMA, NG-methyl-l-arginine; NO, nitric oxide; ODQ, 1H-[1,2,
  4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one; PMN, polymorphonuclear leukocyte; TNF-α, tumor
  necrosis factor-α.'
