caption: 'MSCs-Exo alleviated cognitive impairment of dNCR mice in a SIRT1-dependent
  manner. The mice were randomly divided into 5 groups: Sham group, dNCR group, dNCR+MSCs-Exo
  group, dNCR+MSCs-Exo + EX-527 group, and dNCR+EX-527 group. (a, b) SIRT1 expression
  in each group was determined by Western blot. (c) Escape latency during the MWM
  navigation test. (d) The representative trajectory diagrams of the swimming distance
  to find the platform (blue dots: starting position; yellow dots: ending position).
  (e) The platform-crossing times in the MWM test. (f) The time spent in the target
  quadrant during the MWM test. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM (n = 5/group). ∗P
  < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001, Sham vs. dNCR or Sham vs. dNCR+EX-527; #P
  < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01, dNCR vs. dNCR+MSCs-Exo; $P < 0.05 and $$P < 0.01, dNCR+MSCs-Exo
  vs. dNCR+MSCs-Exo + EX-527. EX-527: a specific SIRT1 inhibitor.'
