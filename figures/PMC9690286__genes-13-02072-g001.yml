caption: 'Formation of small non-coding RNAs. miRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase
  (Pol) II to generate pri-miRNA, which is then processed by DGCR8 and Drosha to form
  pre-miRNA inside the nucleus. It is further exported to cytoplasm by Exportin5 and
  Ran-GTP. Dicer and TRBP in cytoplasm further cleave and process pre-miRNA into mature,
  short double-stranded miRNA. One strand of the mature miRNA duplex binds with Argonaute
  protein to form RISC, while another strand is degraded. siRNA is derived from long
  dsRNA produced by transcription of sense and antisense strands by RNA Pol II and
  viral infection. Then, dsRNA is processed by Dicer into siRNA duplex, of which one
  strand binds with Argonaute protein to form the siRNA-induced silencing complexes,
  while another strand is degraded as well. As for piRNA, piRNA genes are transcribed
  by RNA Pol II to produce pri-piRNA through the primary procession pathway. pri-piRNA
  is exported into the cytoplasm and cleaved into pre-piRNA. Then, pre-piRNA is processed
  by Zuc and Hen1 to form mature piRNA. Mature piRNA in complex with PIWI proteins
  to work. Additionally, Aub and AGO3 coupled with mature piRNA cleave transcript-bearing
  sites complementary to the piRNA sequence, thus amplifying mature piRNA species
  through the “ping-pong” cycle. As for tsRNA, after it is transcribed by RNA Pol
  III, pre-tRNA undergoes processes and modifications to form mature tRNA. Ribonuclease
  cleavage in various region of pre-tRNA and mature tRNA generates different types
  of tsRNAs, including 3′U tRF, 5′tRF, 3′tRF, i-tRF, 5′tiRNA, and 3′tiRNA. Abbreviations:
