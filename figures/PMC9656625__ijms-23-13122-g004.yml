caption: STAT1/3 phosphorylation in ASCs and macrophages. To detect STAT1/3 phosphorylation,
  protein samples were prepared after 15 min of treatment with TNF-α, IL-1β, and/or
  IFN-γ + LPS and analyzed using immunoblotting in ASCs (A) and macrophages (B). The
  data shown represent one of three independent experiments.
