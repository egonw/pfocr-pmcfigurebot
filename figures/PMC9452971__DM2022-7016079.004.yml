caption: SEC61G promotes CC growth and progression in vivo. (a) Nude mice were subcutaneously
  implanted with SiHa cells overexpressing SEC61G (SiHa-SEC61G) and a control group
  (SiHa-mock). Tumor growth curves were measured at the indicated time points between
  SiHa-SEC61G and SiHa-mock. ∗P < 0.05, one-way ANOVA. (b) Each group was injected
  with 2 × 106 cells; tumors were excised on day 21 postinjection. (c) Tumor weight
  was measured when the tumor was removed. (d) Representative images of IHC staining
  showing a positive correlation between Ki-67 and SEC61G overexpression in subcutaneous
  implants of each group. (e) Relative intensity of Ki-67 staining. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs.
  mock group.
