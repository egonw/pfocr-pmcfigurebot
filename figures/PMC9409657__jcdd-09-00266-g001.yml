caption: '(A) Representative M-mode echocardiographic parameters were recorded through
  the anterior and posterior left ventricular walls and obtained with a 2D short-axis
  view at the level of the papillary muscles. (B) representative H&E (hematoxylin
  and eosin stain). (C) representative TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated
  dUTP nick end labeling) assay (top: green spots) and DAPI staining (bottom: blue
  spots) of cardiac sections from left ventricles in the normotensive group (WKY),
  untreated hypertensive group (SHR), and SHR rats with treated irbesartan (SHR-ARB).
  The images were magnified ×400. (D) Bars indicate the percentage of TUNEL-positive
  cells and show mean ± standard deviation, (n = 6;6;6). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.001:
  significant differences from the WKY group. * p < 0.05 significant differences from
  the Control group. ## p < 0.01 indicates significant differences between the SHR
  group and the SHR-ARB group.'
