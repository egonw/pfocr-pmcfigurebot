caption: Effect of knockdown of DUSP1 on the expression of key proteins of BCG-induced
  endogenous apoptosis pathway in macrophages. (A) THP-1 cells were transfected with
  siRNA-NC (negative control) or siRNA-DUSP1 for 24 h, and then infected with BCG
  and cultured for 6 h. The expression levels of endogenous apoptotic pathway key
  proteins Bcl-2, Bax, cytochrome C, Apaf-1, cleaved-Caspase9 were detected using
  Western blotting. (B–F) Endogenous apoptotic pathway key results of grey-scale analysis
  of protein expression. (G) THP-1 cells were transfected with siRNA-NC (negative
  control) or siRNA-DUSP1 for 24 h, and then infected with BCG and cultured for 6 h.
  Mitochondrial membrane potential was detected by flow cytometry. All data are represented
  as mean ± SD (n = 3). (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).
