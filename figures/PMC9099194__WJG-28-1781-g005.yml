caption: 'Recombinant human heparin binding epidermal growth factor reverses the forkhead
  Box q1-induced suppression of colorectal cancer cell proliferation and migration
  in vitro. A: A cell counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was performed to detect the effects
  of recombinant human heparin binding epidermal growth factor (rhHB-EGF) on the proliferation
  of forkhead Box q1 (FOXQ1)-deficient DLD1 and SW480 cells; B: The Transwell migration
  assay was performed to evaluate the migration ability after knocking out FOXQ1 and
  after adding rhHB-EGF; C: A statistical analysis of the results of the Transwell
  migration assay was performed. bP < 0.01; D: After 0 h and 24 h, the scratch experiment
  evaluated the migration ability of DLD1 and SW480 cells with downregulated FOXQ1
  and rhHB-EGF; E: Statistical analysis of the above scratch experiment results. aP
  < 0.05; bP < 0.01; cP < 0.001; F: Quantitative analysis of Western blot to detect
  the expression of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin and Snail protein levels in DLD-shFOXQ1
  and SW480-shFOXQ1 cells compared to DLD1-shControl and SW480-shControl cells. Î²-actin
  was used as the loading control. CCK-8: Cell Counting Kit-8.'
