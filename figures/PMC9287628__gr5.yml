caption: mRNA expression of PD-L1 and associated genes in head and neck SCC cell lines
  after Fusobacterium infection. (A) PD-L1 mRNA expression with T. denticola and T.
  forsythia in OQ01 cell lines and with F. periodonticum and F. Vincentii in OQ01
  and RPMI 2650 cell lines. (B) mRNA expression of PD-L1 pathway associated genes
  with the in OQ01 (left) and RPMI 2650 cells (right). Data are shown as the log2
  fold change of gene expression relative to uninfected control. All bar graph results
  are presented as mean ± SEM based on 3 independent experiments (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001). Solid bars represent infection with F. periodonticum (FP) and bars
  with dots represent infection with F. vincentii (FV).
article_title: Fusobacterium is enriched in oral cancer and promotes induction of
  programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1).
