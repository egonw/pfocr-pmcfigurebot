caption: Graphical representation of changes in gene expression encoding key enzymes
  involved in selected pathways of energy transformations in experimental group of
  rats with copper deficiency. ‘⬆’ indicates overexpression of the gene encoding the
  given enzyme; ‘⬇’ indicates a downexpression of the gene encoding the given enzyme;
  ‘-’ means there are no significant statistical changes. The graphic was made in
  the open-source vector graphics editor InkScape. ADP, Adenosine diphosphate; ATP,
  Adenosine triphosphate; CO2, Carbon dioxide; CoA, Coenzyme A; Cpt2, Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase
