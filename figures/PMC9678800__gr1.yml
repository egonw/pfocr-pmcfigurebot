caption: The T3SS regulatory network in MM (inducingconditions) in P. syringae. T3SS
  is primarily activated by the HrpRSL pathway, which is under the control of the
  top TCS RhpRS under inducing conditions (MM or in planta). More than 20 regulators
  collectively control this regulatory network (CorRS, CvsRS, GacAS, RhpRS, PilRS,
  HrpRS, HrpL, HrpA, HrpT, AefR, PsrA, RhpP, RpoN, HrpV, HrpG, HrpF, HrpJ, Lon, and
  PSPPH_3618). In MM, HrpRS binds the hrpL promoter region to induce its expression,
  and HrpL directly activates the hrp box and the transcription of T3SS-related genes.
  GacA indirectly inhibits hrpRS transcription, whereas CvsR, HrpA, and AlgU directly
  induce the transcription of hrpRS. HrpT, PilR, and HrpL repress hrpL expression,
  whereas AefR and PsrA activate its expression in MM. PilR also suppresses the expression
  of T3SS effectors, including hrpW1, hopX1, hopG1, and hopF3. Lon inhibits the expression
  of hopR1, hrpB, and hopAJ1. PSPPH_3618 positively regulates the transcription of
  avrB2 and rhpP. RhpP directly degrades the HrpL protein. In planta, RhpS senses
  polyphenols through the functions of the Pro40 residue and inhibits T3SS by reducing
  the phosphate activity.
