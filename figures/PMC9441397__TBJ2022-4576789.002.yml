caption: RBM8A knockdown reduces viability and cisplatin (DDP) resistance of breast
  cancer (BC) cells. (a) The viability of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells was analyzed
  by MTT  assay; (b) the viability of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells under different concentrations
  of DDP was evaluated by MTT assay. (c) IC50 of DDP was assessed. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P
  < 0.01 vs. sh-NC. Each experiment was repeated three times.
