caption: Modular gene co-expression analysis identifies inflammatory and extracellular
  matrix integrity pathway modulation in response to voluntary exercise. (A) Gene
  module enrichment identified six modules (M) which were significantly enriched (M2-M4,
  positively enriched, M1, M5 and M6, decreased enrichment) compared to sedentary
  controls. (B) Profile plots of genes within modules M5 and M6 to show representative
  similar gene expression trends within modules. (C,D) Pathway analyses showing inflammatory
  and extracellular matrix integrity pathways were associated with genes in M5 and
  M6 respectively.
