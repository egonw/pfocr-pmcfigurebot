caption: Glutathione (GSH) is involved in the neuroprotective effect of narcissoside
  (NCS), preventing 6-OHDA-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in SH-SY5Y
  cells. (A) Cells were pretreated with a series concentration of NCS for 24 h, then
  treated 100-μM 6-OHDA for 18 h. ROS levels were measured using the H2DCFDA method.
  (B) Cells were treated with 1 μM NCS for 0, 6, 12, or 24 h and then measure GSH
  level by GSH assay kit. (C) The protein expression of the catalytic subunit (GCLC)
  and modifier subunit (GCLM) of glutamate cysteine ligase (γ-GCL) in (B) was determined
  by western blotting. The expression of β-tubulin is internal control. (left). The
  intensity of the signal was quantified by the ImageJ software. (right). (D) Cells
  were pretreated with or without 1-μM NCS for 24 h, and then treated 100-μM 6-OHDA
  for the indicated times. GSH levels were measured using a GSH assay kit. (E) The
  protein expression of GCLC and GCLM in (D) was determined by western blotting. The
  expression of β-tubulin is internal control. (left). The intensity of the signal
  was quantified by the ImageJ software. (right).
