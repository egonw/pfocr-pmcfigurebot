caption: 'RRP9 induces gemcitabine resistance through the IGF2BP1/AKT signaling pathway
  activation in PC cell lines. A Immunofluorescence staining showing co-localization
  of IGF2BP1 and RRP9 in control and RRP-overexpressing PC cells. Scale bar, 20 μm.
  B Immunoprecipitation assay demonstrating that RRP9 interacts with IGF2BP1 in control
  and RRP-overexpressing PC cells. C Colony formation was assessed in control, siRNA-IGF2BP1
  or RRP9-OE/siRNA-IGF2BP1 cells treated with gemcitabine (50 μM). Representative
  colony formation images (left) and quantification (right) are shown. Data are presented
  by mean ± SD, n = 3. D FACS analysis (left) and quantification (right) in control,
  siRNA-IGF2BP1 or RRP9-OE/siRNA-IGF2BP1 cells treated with gemcitabine (50 μM). Data
  are expressed as mean ± SD, n = 3. Note: *p < 0.05'
