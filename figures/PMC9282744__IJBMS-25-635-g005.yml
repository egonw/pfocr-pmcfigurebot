caption: Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) positively regulated the
  secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and aggravated periodontal tissue damage,
  and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was involved. (A) The alveolar bone loss in the
  EP (experimental periodontitis), EP+PBS, EP+CPS (TRPV1 agonist capsaicin) and EP+CPZ
  (TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine) groups was measured by stereomicroscopy and statistically
  analyzed. Scale bars = 1000 μm (B) The mRNA levels of TRPV1, TNF-α and IL-1β were
  detected by real-time PCR with GAPDH as a control. (C) Western blotting was used
  to detect the expression levels of TRPV1, PI3K, phospho-PI3K, Akt, phospho-Akt,
  and IL-1β. (D) Analysis of the protein expression levels of TRPV1 and IL-1β relative
  to GAPDH. (E) PI3K and AKT phosphorylation level analysis. The data are expressed
  as the mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments. * P< 0.05, *
