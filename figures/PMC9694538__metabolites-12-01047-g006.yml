caption: (a) 0.75 µg/mL of DOX; (b) 1.5 µg/mL of DOX; (c) 7.5 µg/mL of DOX. The metabolite
  set enrichment analysis of our metabolites with DOX treatment in HCT116 cells. Pathway
  analysis is displayed from HCT116 cells datasets using the Holm-Bonferroni method
  and False Discovery Rate. Each row represents a pathway, and each column represents
  a -log10 (p-value). The topmost pathway shows the results from the top down (according
  to the enrichment ratio). A purple arrow indicates significant metabolic pathways.
