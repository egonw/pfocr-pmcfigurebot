caption: Difference in the main metabolites of Dendrobium nobile at two growth stages.
  a, PCA analysis of total metabolites in D. nobile stem at two growth stages. b,
  heatmap of the differentially accumulated metabolites at two growth stages (VIP
  score were ≥ 1 and P-value were < 0.05 according OPLS-DA). Three columns of DnS1
  and DnS2 represented three replicates. Color scale on the top right of the heat
  map represented normalized values of each identified metabolites content. c, bubble
  plot of KEGG enrichment of the differentially accumulated metabolites. The y-axis
  indicates the pathway names, and the x-axis indicates the impact score of topology
  analysis corresponding to the pathway. The P-value is represented by the color of
  the dot. The score of impact is represented by the size of the dot. Different colors
  of KEGG pathways represented different classes of pathways according to the secondary
  classification of KEGG Pathway Maps. DnS1, immature stems; DnS2, mature stems.
article_title: Metabolic and transcriptomic analyses elucidate a novel insight into
  the network for biosynthesis of carbohydrate and secondary metabolites in the stems
  of a medicinal orchid Dendrobium nobile.
