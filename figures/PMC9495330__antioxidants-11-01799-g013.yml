caption: MMT supplementation improved the growth performance of broilers by modulating
  intestinal microbiota, enhancing the intestinal barrier function, and improving
  inflammatory response, which might be mediated by inhibiting the TLRs/MAPK/NF-κB
  signaling pathway, and antioxi-dative capacity mediated by the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling
  pathway. ↑ Arrows indicate the effect of stimulation; ↓ Arrows indicate the effect
  of suppression.
