caption: EMT-associated proteins were regulated by deguelin, PTEN, and KLF4. (a) EMT-associated
  proteins were detected in A549 cells and PC9 cells by deguelin and PTEN-siR/overexpression.
  (b) EMT-associated proteins were detected in A549 cells and PC9 cells by deguelin
  and KLF4-siR/overexpression. Î²-Actin was used as an internal control. All experiments
  were repeated at least in triplicate.
