caption: 'MAPK cross talk balances apoptosis. (A) Scheme showing the relationships
  between MAPK pathways based on data shown below and in SI Appendix, Fig. S8. While
  stress-activated MAPKs (p38 and JNK) activate the respective pathway, the ERK pathway
  inhibits stress-activated MAPKs. Antagonism between ERK and JNK pathways is reflected
  on the level of apoptosis. (B) Comparison of protocols provided by the manufacturer
  and as published in Vogg et al. () and Chera et al. (). Specificity of the TUNEL
  reaction was tested by comparing polyps that had been fixed overnight, followed
  by amputation to animals that had been first bisected and subsequently fixed. Upper:
  Incubation step at 70 °C yielded the same rate of TUNEL-positive cells in animals
  fixed before and after amputation. Therefore, the signal was considered to be unspecific,
  and incubation of polyps in citrate buffer was executed exclusively at room temperature
  to prevent an unspecific stain despite the decreased signal intensity (Lower). Scale
  bars: 250 µm. (C) Time lapse of apoptosis visualized by TUNEL assay from bisected
  polyps fixed at the indicated time points. The maximum of apoptotic cells is detectable
  between 1 and 2 hpa in both head and foot regenerates. Scale bars: 250 µm. (D) Visualization
  of apoptotic cells by TUNEL assay analysis in bisected polyps upon inhibition of
  MAPKs at 1.5 hpa. While p38 inhibition has no effect on apoptotic events, the frequency
  clearly increased upon JNK inhibition and was diminished in the presence of the
  ERK inhibitor. Note that there is no difference between head and foot regenerates.
  Scale bars: 250 µm. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) in all shown images.'
