caption: Salubrinal and zIETDfmk promote survival of 6OHDA-treated dDCNs (A) A 63%
  cell survival was determined in 6OHDA+ salubrinal-treated dDCNs, showing 6OHDA-induced
  stress has triggered the PERK pathway. A 72% cell survival was measured in 6OHDA+
  zIETDfmk treated dDCNs, demonstrating 6OHDA triggered caspase-8 activation in dDCNs.
  A survival of 85% was seen in 6OHDA+ salubrinal + zIETDfmk-treated dDCNs, indicating
  that the PERK pathway does not influence caspase-8 activation in dDCNs. zIETDfmk
  in combination with salubrinal promoted further survival of 6OHDA-treated dDCNs,
  indicating an additional benefit of targeting ER stress pathway and caspase-8. The
  proportion of cells surviving was determined by MTT absorbance at 570 nm. Means
  of three experiments ± SEM is shown. (B) Illustrative example of GAPDH and active
  caspase-8 in control, salubrinal-treated, 6OHDA-treated and salubrinal+6OHDA-treated
  dDCNs (C). Quantitatively, an 81% increase in caspase-8 level was detected in 6OHDA-treated
  dDCNs compared to control dDCNs (100%) (p < 0.05). There was no effect of salubrinal
  treatment on caspase-8 level in salubrinal-treated and 6OHDA+salubrinal-treated
  dDCNs (p > 0.05). Means of three experiments ± SEM is shown. A table of values and
  statistical analysis can be found in  for (A,C), respectively.
