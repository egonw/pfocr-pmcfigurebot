caption: Characterization of rBMSCs. (a) Primary culture of rBMSCs. (b–d) Multiple
  differentiation ability of rBMSCs. Cells were treated with osteogenic induction
  medium for 14 days and stained with (b) Alizarin Red. Cells were treated with adipogenic
  induction medium for 14 days and stained with (c) Oil Red “O.” Cells were treated
  with chondrogenic induction medium for 21 days and stained with (d) Alcian blue.
  (e) Flow cytometry analysis of surface markers of rBMSCs. rBMSCs were positive for
  mesenchymal stem cell markers (CD29, CD44, and CD90), but negative for hematopoietic
  cell markers (CD34 and CD45). The FITC-conjugated mouse IgG isotype was used as
  a negative control. Scale bar, 100 μm.
