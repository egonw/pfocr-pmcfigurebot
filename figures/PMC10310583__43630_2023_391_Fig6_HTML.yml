caption: 'MeJA transiently up-regulates AtBBX29 but AtBBX29 does not affect JA metabolism
  or JA signaling pathway. a Expression levels of AtBBX29 in Col plants sprayed with
  MeJA (50 µM) and harvested at different time points: 0 h (control), 1, 3 or 5 h.
  Values are normalized to IPP2 transcript levels and expressed relative to 0 h expression
  levels. Data were analyzed by Student’s t test, and asterisks indicate significant
  differences between control (0 h) and other time points (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  NS, not significant). Each datum point represents the mean ± SEM (n = 3 biological
  replicates). b Quantification of jasmonate pools in Col and bbx29-1 plants harvested
  6 h after treatment with 200 µM MeJA or mock solutions. Each bar represents the
  mean ± SEM (n = 4 biological replicates; see methods) and the P values for the relevant
  terms of the ANOVA are shown (two-way ANOVA, G: Genotype, T: hormonal treatment,
  GxT interaction). c Expression levels of JA-markers genes (ST2a and VSP2). Values
  are normalized to IPP2 transcript levels and standardized to Col mock expression
  levels. Each bar represents the mean ± SEM (n ≥ 3 biological replicates) and the
  P values for the relevant terms of the ANOVA are shown (two-way ANOVA, G: Genotype,
  T: hormonal treatment, GxT interaction)'
