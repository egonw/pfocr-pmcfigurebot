caption: 'Signal pathway involved in TREM2 and ApoE in microglia. (1) After apoptotic
  neurons or inflammatory substances, such as LPS, stimulate TREM2, the intracellular
  ApoE expression is up-regulated, causing microglia to transform into a disease-related
  phenotype. At the same time, it promotes intracellular lipid metabolism. (2) After
  being secreted by astrocytes, ApoE binds to cellular wastes, such as Aβ or apoptotic
  neurons in CNS, and then activates TREM2. On one hand, it causes the enhancement
  of microglia phagocytosis. In addition, it inhibits the inflammation of microglia
  through the PI3K/Akt pathway. (3) CD33 and CD68 play a regulatory role in this pathway.
