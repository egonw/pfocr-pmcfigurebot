caption: 'GFRα and treatment resistance. Chemoresistance: Cisplatin stimulates overexpression
  of GFRα1 via NFκB phosphorylation and decreases cisplatin-induced apoptosis, accompanied
  by increased autophagy, and significantly promotes cell proliferation through the
  SRC-AMPK signaling axis. Endocrine resistance: GFLs/GFRα/RET and ER signaling participate
  in intricate crosstalk via the PI3K/mTOR and RAS/MEK/ERK pathways in breast cancer.
  Endocrine therapy promotes the expression of GFLs, resulting in a vicious loop of
  RET signaling. Hypoxia resistance: Hypoxia directly activates ARTN transcription
  via HIF-1α, and the ARTN-dependent AKT pathway is then activated to trigger expansion
  of the CSC population. The solid arrows indicate the known and direct interactions
  between signaling molecules; the broken arrows indicate interactions requiring further
  investigation. The red arrows indicate the main GFRα signaling pathway.'
