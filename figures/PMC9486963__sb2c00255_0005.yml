caption: 'Networks beyond gene circuitry: coupling circuit designs to host metabolic
  networks and circuit-building protocols. (A) The network of a gene circuit that
  uses arabinose as input can interact with the arabinose degradation pathway. Top
  figure: abstract network displaying critical components of a NOR gate and the initial
  steps of the arabinose pathway. Bottom figure: linking the corresponding extended
  networks. (B) NOR-gate experimental protocol formalized as a network structure.
  The network can be interactively adjusted to show different levels of abstraction.
  Nodes represent reagents or subprotocols, and edges imply input/output relationships.'
