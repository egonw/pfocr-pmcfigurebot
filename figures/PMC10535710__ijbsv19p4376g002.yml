caption: 'BEA inhibits the TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling pathway in OS cells. (A) KEGG pathway
  enrichment analysis in BEA-treated and untreated 143B cells. (B) The effect of BEA
  on the TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of Smad2/3, TGFBR1, and TGFBR2 in OS cells
  was evaluated by Western blotting. (C) Cellular immunofluorescence assay was performed
  to assess the nuclear translocation of p-Smad2/3 in OS cells treated with BEA. Scale
  bar: 20 μm. (D) The transcriptional activity of Smad2/3 in OS cells treated as indicated
  was determined by a Smad2/3 luciferase reporter assay. (E) 143B and U2OS cells were
  treated with BEA (2 μM) for 24 h and total RNA was harvested and analyzed by qPCR.
  Quantification of the mRNA levels of COL1A1, COL3A1, COL6A1, COL10A1, MMP2, LOX,
  LOXL2 in OS cells. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. n = 3. *p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  and ***p < 0.001 vs. the CTL (control) group, and ## p < 0.01 and ###p < 0.001 vs.
  the TGF-β1-treated group.'
