caption: 'Different pathways of DNA double-strand breaks repair. HR pathway occurs
  using three steps: extension of ssDNA, a transition from DNA strand invasion to
  synthesis, and restoration of DNA strand integrity. NHEJ pathway begins with the
  Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer binding to the ends of the double-strand break (DSB). DNA-PK
  complex makes this binding even tighter. The ligation step for either strand of
  the DSB is carried out by the enzymes such as Ligases IV complex shown in the figure.
