caption: 'Human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells activated the heme oxygenase-1
  and JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway to protect against hyperoxia-induced multiple-organ
  injury. A: The protein extracted from tissue homogenates of the lungs, heart, and
  kidneys were collected for western blotting to detect heme oxygenase-1, JAK2, STAT3
  protein expression levels, as well as their phosphorylation; Bâ€“F: Statistical analyses
  of protein expression levels of the above-mentioned genes. aP < 0.05; bP < 0.01;
  cP < 0.001. iT: Intratracheal; iP: Intraperitoneal; HO-1: Heme oxygenase-1; GAPDH:
  Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; MSC: Mesenchymal stem cell.'
article_title: Intratracheal administration of umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal
  stem cells attenuates hyperoxia-induced multi-organ injury via heme oxygenase-1
  and JAK/STAT pathways.
