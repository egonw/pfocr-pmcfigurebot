caption: Accumulation of isoflavonoid metabolites in Medicago truncatula A17 and R108
  leaves at early time points of powdery mildew (PM) infection. (a–i) Data represent
  the mean ± SEM of four independent biological replicates. The x axes represent hours
  postinoculation (hpi) with Erisyphe pisi. Significant differences between infection
  time points compared to 0 hpi were computed using one‐way analysis of variance with
  Dunnett's multiple comparisons test and between genotypes by unpaired t test (*p ≤ 0.05,
  **p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤ 0.001, ****p ≤ 0.0001). 2HF, 2′‐hydroxyformononetin; 2MF, 2′‐methoxyformononetin
