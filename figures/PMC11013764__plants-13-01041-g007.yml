caption: '(A) Major parts involved in the arginine biosynthetic pathway and proline
  and arginine metabolic pathways. We divided these into four modules: I. ornithine
  synthesis; II. urea cycle (arginine synthesis); III. proline metabolism; IV. polyamine
  synthesis. Up-regulated genes/metabolites are marked in red font, and down-regulated
  genes/metabolites are marked in green font. (B) Changes in the contents of ornithine,
  arginine and polyamines in the four stages. The main Y-axis (left) corresponds with
  the bar chart, and the secondary Y-axis (right) corresponds with the line chart.
  Lowercase letters indicate significant differences between groups (p < 0.05).'
