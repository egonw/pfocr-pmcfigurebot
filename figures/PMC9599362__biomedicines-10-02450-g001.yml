caption: NF-κB subunits and signaling pathways in B cells. Stimulation via cell surface
  receptors leads to activation of the IKK complex or NIK, the upstream regulators
  of the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathway, respectively (adaptor molecules
  not shown). In the canonical pathway, phosphorylation of IκB by IKKs causes its
  proteasomal degradation, thus releasing the NF-κB dimers RELA/p50 and c-REL/p50
  for nuclear translocation. In the non-canonical pathway, NIK activates IKKα, which
  in turn induces the processing of the p100 inhibitor κB subunit to p52, thus releasing
  the NF-κB dimer RELB/p52 for nuclear translocation. Only RELA, c-REL and RELB contain
  transactivation domains that drive transcription of NF-κB target genes.
