caption: 'The proposed role of tryptophan (TRP) metabolism by the kynurenine pathway
  (KP) in the leading cells of innate immunity during the generation of immunosuppression/immunoparalysis
  during sepsis. DCs and macrophages belong to the APCs that mediate the cellular
  immune response by processing and presenting antigens for recognition by particular
  subsets of T cells. The activation of IDO1 and IDO2 in APCs initiates the metabolism
  of TRP via the kynurenine pathway, resulting in depletion of TRP and accumulation
  of kynurenine (KYN) in the immune cells’ environment. KYN, through AhR activation,
  can affect the different intracellular signalling pathways in DCs and macrophages,
  increasing the anti-inflammatory response and parallelly decreasing the proinflammatory
  response of these cells. Depletion of TRP and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α),
  which is associated with the generation of KYN and anti-inflammatory cytokines,
  like TGF-β, creates an environment conducive to the origination of immunotolerogenic
  Tregs with a simultaneously reduced number and function of Th17, cytotoxic CD4+
  and CD8+ T cells, leading to an overall impairment of immune functions and immunosuppression
  development. Abbreviations: DCs—dendritic cells; APCs—antygen presenting cells;
  IDO1—indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1; IDO2—indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 2; KYN—kynurenine;
  AhR—aryl hydrocarbon receptor; NF-κB—the nuclear factor NF-kappaB; STAT3—the signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 3; IL-6—interleukin-6; TNF-α—tumor necrosis
  factor alpha; TGF-β—transforming growth factor-beta; Tregs—regulatory T cells; Th17—T
  helper 17.'
