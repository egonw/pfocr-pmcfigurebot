caption: Knock-down of ADAR1 in inactive CD LPMCs enhances inflammatory pathway. (A)
  Active IRF3 (phosphorylated, p-IRF3, upper panel), active IRF7 (phosphorylated,
  p-IRF7, middle panel) and β-actin (lower panel) protein expression in LPMCs isolated
  from one inactive CD patient and stimulated with poly I:C for 1 hour and pre-incubated
  in presence of a specific ADAR1 antisense oligonucleotide (AS) or a control oligonucleotide
  (S) for 24h. Quantitative data (right panel) are presented as mean ± SEM of 4 separate
  experiments. *p<0.05. (B) LMPCs were isolated from one inactive CD patient and stimulated
  with poly I:C for 12h and pre-incubated with the specific ADAR1 antisense oligonucleotide
  (AS) or a control oligonucleotide (S) for 24h. Representative histoplots showing
  IFN-α/β, IFN-γ and TNF-α expression in CD45+ cells analyzed by flow-cytometry. Data
  are shown as mean ± SEM of 4 separate experiments. *p<0.05, **p<0.01.
