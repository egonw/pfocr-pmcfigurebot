caption: TUNEL staining of ocular tissue sections. The TUNEL assay was performed for
  the LIM guinea pigs after modeling for 4 weeks. The choroidal tissue in the LIM
  group had more dark brown areas than the NC group and an increased number of TUNEL-positive
  cells compared to the NC subjects. Magnification, 400Ã—.
