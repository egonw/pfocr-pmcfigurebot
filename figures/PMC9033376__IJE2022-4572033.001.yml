caption: 'Prolactin inhibited osteoblast differentiation in vitro. (a) A CCK-8 assay
  was performed to evaluate cell viability. (b) Representative images of ALP and ARS
  staining. (c) The ALP-positive cells in each group were quantified. (d) Quantification
  of ARS-stained cells and mineral nodules. n = 3; scale bar = 200 μm; #P < 0.05,
  ##P < 0.01, # vs the 0 ng/ml group; NS: not statistically significant, ∗P < 0.05,
  ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗ vs the NC group. ALP, alkaline phosphatase; ARS, alizarin red S.'
