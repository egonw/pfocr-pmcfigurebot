caption: ESCRT-I deficiency leads to endolysosomal accumulation of cholesterol that
  does not contribute to activation of TFEB/TFE3 signaling. (A) Maximum intensity
  projection confocal images of fixed RKO cells at 48 h post transfection (48 hpt)
  showing the effect of culture in delipidated medium (for 40 h) on the intracellular
  distribution of free cholesterol marked with filipin dye (red) with respect to LAMP1
  protein (green) in control (treated with nontargeting siRNA, Ctrl#1) or ESCRT-I–depleted
  (siTsg101#2 or siVps28#1) cells. Cell nuclei marked with DRAQ7 dye (blue). Scale
  bar, 50 μm. The dot plot on the bottom shows the average filipin fluorescence intensity
  per LAMP1-positive structure (expressed in arbitrary units, a.u.), as compared to
  control cells. Values derived from independent experiments (dots) and their means
  (n = 3 ± SEM) are presented. Statistical significance tested by comparison to averaged
  values measured for control cells (AveCtrl) and/or siTsg101#2 conditions. **P <
  0.01, ***P < 0.001. (B) Maximum intensity projection confocal images of fixed RKO
  cells at 48 hpt showing the effect of culture in delipidated medium on the intracellular
  distribution of TFEB or TFE3 (green) in control or ESCRT-I–depleted cells. Cell
  nuclei marked with DAPI (blue). Dot plots on the right show the percentage of cells
  with nuclear TFEB or TFE3 localization. Values derived from independent experiments
  (dots) and their means (n = 3 ± SEM) are presented. Statistical significance tested
  by comparison to siCtrl#1 conditions. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
