caption: Pathway enrichment analysis. (a) Enrichment analysis of genes upregulated
  by RA/IFNα and predicted targets of miR-27-5a-p and miR-222-5p (Cluster 1) was conducted
  using the BiNGO app in Cytoscape. (b) Enrichment analysis of genes downregulated
  by RA/IFNα and predicted targets of miR-4284 and miR-212-3p (Cluster 1) was conducted
  using the BiNGO app in Cytoscape.
