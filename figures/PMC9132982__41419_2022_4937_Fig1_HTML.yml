figure_title: The effect of proguanil on the expression of EGFR
caption: A 3D photocrosslinked microarray was used to immobilize proguanil, and then
  T24 lysates were distributed on the surface of the microarray. The captured target
  proteins by proguanil on the microarray surface were detected by SPRi and identified
  by LC-MS. B MOE molecular docking (using MOE14.0 software) was used to predict the
  binding site of proguanil and EGFR (PDB ID − 4HJO). C T24 were plated in 6-well
  plates (3.0 × 105/well). When the cell density reaches 70–80%, cells were starved
  for 12 h and then treated with proguanil for 6 h, and the expression of p-EGFR and
  EGFR was detected by WB. D T24 were plated in 6-well plates (3.0 × 105 /well). When
  the cell density reaches 70–80%, cells were starved for 12 h and then treated with
  proguanil for 6 h, and the expression level of EGFR mRNA was detected by RT-PCR.
  E T24 were plated on glass disks in 12-well plates (2.0 × 104 /well). After 24 h,
  T24 cells were starved for 12 h and then treated with proguanil, and the changes
  of EGFR were detected by immunofluorescence. Data are representative of three independent
  experiments. Error bars represent means ± SD from triplicate experiments. Vehicle
  control means the concentration of DMSO lower than 0.3% (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001, ns not significant).
