caption: 'Representative images of the echocardiogram in the left ventricle of control
  and GW788388 drug-treated male Npr1 gene-disrupted mice: representative M-mode images
  of the left ventricle for each group were calculated from the average of 6 sessions/day
  for five consecutive days. The representative images are shown for 0-copy, 1-copy,
  and 2-copy mice with and without GW788388 treatments. Longer blue lines indicate
  LVED-d and shorter blue lines indicate LVED-s in the echocardiogram images. Each
  image is the representative of a minimum of three cardiac cycles per animal (n =
  6 mice per groups).'
