caption: (A,B) Relative protein levels of Wnt, β-catenin, and p-β-catenin after KYSE30,
  KYSE150, and KYSE410 were treated by Rh4. (C) Immunohistochemical analysis showed
  that Rh4 attenuated Wnt, β-catenin, and p-β-catenin in lymph nodes and lungs. Scale
  bar = 100 µm. (D) Immunofluorescence analysis showed that Rh4 also attenuated the
  level of Wnt and β-catenin in lymph nodes and lungs. Scale bar = 10 µm. All data
  are presented as mean ± SD, * p < 0.05, and ** p < 0.01.
