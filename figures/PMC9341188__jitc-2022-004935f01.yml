caption: Delta-24-RGDOX treatment remodels the tumor microenvironment. Differentially
  expressed genes in tumors treated with PBS versus tumors treated with Delta-24-RGDOX
  were used for clustering, gene ontology (GO) biological process enrichment analysis,
  and pathway and network analyses. Analyses of tumors were performed on day 12, 5 days
  after the first dose of Delta-24-RGDOX. (A) Heatmap comparing the transcriptional
  signatures of intracranial GL261-5–derived tumors treated with PBS or Delta-24-RGDOX.
  The log2-normalized expression levels of genes with significant adjusted p values
  (<0.05) across samples are shown. The color scale is shown above the heatmap. (B)
  GO biological process enrichment results for tumors treated with PBS or Delta-24-RGDOX.
  The five most significant GO biological processes are shown. GO biological processes
  significantly associated with PBS-treated tumors are marked as ‘+’, whereas those
  significantly associated with Delta-24-RGDOX-treated tumors are marked as ‘–’. (C)
  The five most significantly altered canonical pathways in tumors treated with PBS
  vs Delta-24-RGDOX. Activation z-scores are plotted in the graph. †Hypercytokinemia/hyperchemokinemia
  in the pathogenesis of influenza; ††neuroinflammation signaling pathway. (D) The
  five most significantly altered upstream regulators in tumors treated with PBS versus
  Delta-24-RGDOX. Activation z-scores are plotted in the graph. The negative z-scores
  represent activation in Delta-24-RGDOX. (E) The prediction of the immune cell composition
  in GL261-5-derived brain tumors treated with PBS or Delta-24-RGDOX. The percentages
  of various immune cell populations in each sample are presented in the graph. The
  color code for the various immune cell types is shown to the right of the graph.
  (F) IDO1 network genes with significantly altered expression levels in tumors treated
  with PBS or Delta-24-RGDOX. The color intensity indicates the log2 fold-change (green=activation)
  levels for each gene in PBS-treated tumors vs Delta-24-RGDOX-treated tumors. IDO,
  indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase.
