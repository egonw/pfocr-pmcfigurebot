caption: 'Graphs of evaluation of oxidative stress and signaling pathway: (a) iNOS
  in airways and (b) iNOS in alveolar septa are expressed in cells/104 µm2; (c) exhaled
  nitric oxide is expressed in ppb; (d) NF-κB in airways and (e) NF-κB in alveolar
  septa are expressed in cells/104 µm2. * p < 0.05 compared to SAL group; # p < 0.05
  compared to ACO group; ++ p < 0.05 compared to OVA group; $$ p < 0.05 compared to
  ACO-pep-BbKI group. N = 8 to each group. iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase;
  NF, nuclear factor.'
