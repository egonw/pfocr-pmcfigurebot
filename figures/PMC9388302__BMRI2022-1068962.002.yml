caption: Activity of FoxO1 is under tightly control in macrophage. Protein phosphorylation,
  acetylation and ubiquitination are the major post-translational modification forms
  that affect the expression level, subcellular distribution and the transcriptional
  activity of FoxO1. Phosphorylation, PI3K/AKT signaling pathway mediates the phosphorylation
  of FoxO1, whereas phosphorylation inhibits its function by promoting the nuclear
  exportation and subsequent protein degradation; Acetylation, Deacetylation of FoxO1
  is essential for its nuclear translocation and functional activity during which
  process SIRTs are the key regulators in macrophage; Ubiquitination, the degradation
  of FoxO1 ubiquitination mainly dependents on ubiquitination in macrophages. The
  phosphorylation combined with acetylation and ubiquitination orchestrates FoxO1
  function. The phosphorylation leads to an increased nuclear exportation of FoxO1,
  the exported FoxO1 is ubiquitinated and subsequently degraded in cytoplasmic proteasomes.
  On the contrary, the acetylation of FoxO1 fosters the nuclear transcription and
  negatively regulates the ubiquitination. PML, Promyelocytic Leukemia Nuclear Bodies;
  SIRT6, sirtuin-6 (NAD-dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin-6).
