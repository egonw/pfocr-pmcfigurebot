caption: Hyphal morphogenesis in C. albicans is induced by environmental signals acting
  via multiple signaling cascades, including a cAMP-dependent pathway and a MAPK pathway
  (). Our RNA-sequencing data revealed that the transcription of many filamentation
  activators and key outputs of these pathways (including hyphal-specific proteins
  Ume6, Eed1, and Hgc1) were significantly downregulated in the presence of mucin
  glycans (, ). Hyphal-specific gene expression is negatively regulated by a protein
  complex consisting of the general transcriptional corepressor Tup1 and DNA-binding
  proteins Nrg1 or Rfg1. The transcription of NRG1, a major transcriptional repressor
  of filamentation, increased in the presence of mucin glycans (). Thus, mucin glycans
  may inhibit filamentation by regulating transcriptional activators and/or repressors,
  which play prominent roles in the yeast-to-hyphal transition.
