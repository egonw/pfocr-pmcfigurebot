figure_title: RNF8 upregulates the transcription of endogenous AR target genes in
  prostate cancer cells
caption: A mRNA-seq analysis profile of control and RNF8 silencing 22Rv1 cells treated
  without or with DHT (10−8 M) for 24 h. The heat map displays gene expression change
  of DHT-induced genes upon RNF8 knockdown. Fold change is indicated as left. B Venn
  diagram showed DHT-regulated genes in shCtrl and shRNF8 cells in the absence or
  presence of DHT (10−8 M). C Biological processes of DHT-induced transcripts impacted
  by RNF8 knockdown without or with DHT (10−8 M) treatment as revealed by KEGG pathway
  analysis. D The transcription levels of indicated genes in control or RNF8 silencing
  22Rv1 cells treated without or with DHT (10−8 M) for 24 h (n = 3). E, F The mRNA
  and protein levels of KLK3 (PSA) in control or RNF8 silencing 22Rv1 cells with the
  vehicle, DHT (10−8 M) or enzalutamide (10 µM) treatment for 24 h. G, H The mRNA
  and protein levels of KLK3 (PSA) in 22Rv1 cells transfected with Flag-RNF8 or Flag-RNF8C403S
  treated with DHT (10−8 M) for 24 h (n = 3). Data of the qRT-PCR were presented as
  the ratio normalized to RPS18 (means ± SEM). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001;
  ****P< 0.0001 (two-sided unpaired t-test). Numbers below the western blot result
  indicate the relative gray value normalized to the internal control (α-tubulin).
