figure_title: Microarray analysis reveals differentially regulated genes and pathways
  in Parkin KO mice upon fasting
caption: a Signaling Pathways altered in significantly upregulated or downregulated
  genes obtained from hindlimb skeletal muscle of fed and fasted Parkin KO and wild
  type controls. b Heat map of microarray analysis showing the levels of differentially
  expressed genes involved in FOXO signalling pathway. Red and green indicate high
  and low gene expression respectively in log 2 base (n = 4). c Heat map of microarray
  analysis showing the levels of differentially expressed ubiquitin pathway genes.
  Red and green indicate high and low gene expression respectively in log 2 base (n = 4).
  d Heat map of microarray analysis showing the levels of differentially expressed
  actin cytoskeleton genes. Red and green indicate high and low gene expression respectively
  in log 2 base (n = 4). e Volcano plot showing differentially expressed genes (log2)
  in fed Parkin KO mice as compared to fed wild type mice with p-value on the y-axis
  (n = 4). f Volcano plot showing differentially expressed genes (log2) in fasted
  Parkin KO mice as compared to fasted wild type mice with p-value on the y-axis (n = 4).
