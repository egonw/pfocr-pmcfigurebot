figure_title: Models for biased resolution of dHJs
caption: (A) Canonical model. In the major interference-dependent crossover pathway,
  a D-loop intermediate is stabilized by ZMM proteins including Msh4-Msh5 to form
  a SEI intermediate. DNA synthesis from the SEI, followed by second-end capture,
  results in the formation of the dHJ intermediate that is stabilized by Msh4-Msh5.
  Biased resolution of the 2 junctions results in crossover formation. In this model,
  Exo1 protection of the nick/flap structure recruits Mlh1-Mlh3 to nick the DNA strand
  opposite the Exo1 protected nick. (B) dHJ resolution through limited branch migration
  (reference []; upper panel; reference [], lower panel). In these models, 1 or both
  junctions of the dHJ move prior to resolution. In the model presented in the upper
  panel, Exo1 protects unligated nicks resulting from DNA synthesis and recruits Mlh1-Mlh3
  as in panel A. A nick translation event through resolution-independent nicks results
  in short patches of repair during branch migration (shown by black arrow). In the
  model presented in the lower panel, Exo1-protection of nicks recruits Mlh1-Mlh3
  as in panel A. (C) dHJ resolution through extended branch migration []. Branch migration
  creates a substrate for Mlh1-Mlh3 polymerization []. In such a model, the signaling
  imposed by the binding of Exo1 to nicks acts at a distance. Mlh1-Mlh3 is recruited
  by Exo1 and forms a polymer with a specific polarity that can displace other factors
  or be activated upon interaction with such factors. The polymer is activated to
  introduce a nick on 1 strand of the duplex DNA on type II dHJs when it forms a critical
  length required for stability. See text for details. dHJ, double Holliday junction;
  SEI, single-end invasion.
