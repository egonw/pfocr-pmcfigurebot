caption: Pathway depicting the proposed sequence of events of a productive SARS-CoV-2
  infection in the gut. Virus binding to the ACE2 receptor expressed on enterocytes
  mediates viral entry inducing an antiviral response that must be antagonized for
  new virions to be produced. This manuscript will evaluate available published data
  on the likelihood of their occurrence.
