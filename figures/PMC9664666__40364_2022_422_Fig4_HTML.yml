caption: Overexpression of MAD2 reversed the knockdown effects of SGOL2-shRNA in HCC.
  A-D, F Invasion, migration, sphere formation, and colony formation assays of SGOL2
  knockdown HCC cells with or without MAD2 overexpression were performed. E SK-HEP-1,
  and HEP3B cells were transfected with shSGOL2 or MAD2 plasmid, and the proliferation
  of HCC cells was detected at Days 3 by CCK-8 assays. The results are presented as
  the mean ± SD, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001
article_title: SGOL2 is a novel prognostic marker and fosters disease progression
  via a MAD2-mediated pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma.
