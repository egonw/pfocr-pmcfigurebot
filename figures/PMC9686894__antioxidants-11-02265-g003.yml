caption: Inhibition of Hedgehog signalling suppresses formation of endochondral ossification
  in injured tendons. (A) Micro-CT images of the vehicle and GANT58 groups 10 weeks
  postinjury. (B) Quantification of the volume of ectopic mineralized bone. (C) H&E
  staining of the vehicle and GANT58 groups 10 weeks postinjury. Scale bar = 100 μm.
  (D) Alcian blue staining of the vehicle and GANT58 groups 4 weeks postinjury. Scale
  bar = 100 μm. (E–I) qRT–PCR analysis of osteogenic-specific genes such as OCN (E)
  and RUNX2 (F) and chondrogenic-specific genes such as AGG (G), COL2A1 (H), and SOX9
  (I) in tendon specimens of the vehicle and GANT58 groups 1, 4, 7, and 10 weeks postinjury.
  (J,K) Images of IHC staining of OCN (J) and RUNX2 (K) in the tendons of the vehicle
  and GANT58 groups 10 weeks postinjury. Scale bar = 20 μm. (L,M) Images of IHC staining
  of AGG (L) and COL2A1 (M) in the tendons of the vehicle and GANT58 groups 4 weeks
  postinjury. Scale bar = 20 μm. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
