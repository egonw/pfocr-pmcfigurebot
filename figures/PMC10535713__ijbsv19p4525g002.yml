caption: 'PBX3 promotes tumor cells PPP. A-B. Intracellular NADPH/NADP+ ratio in PBX3-knocked
  down (A) and PBX3-overexpressed (B) HCT116 cells C-D. Intracellular ROS level in
  PBX3-knocked down (C) and PBX3-overexpressed (D) HCT116 cells. Representative images
  (left) and quantification results (right; n = 3) are shown. E. Percentage of apoptotic
  cells in PBX3-knocked down HCT116 cells, as examined using Annexin V/PI staining
  and flow cytometry. F. Lipid accumulation in PBX3-knocked down HCT116 cells, as
  examined using Nile red staining. Representative images (left) and quantification
  results (right; n = 6) are shown. G. Proliferation potential of PBX3-knocked down
  HCT116 cells, as examined using EdU-incorporation assay. Representative images (left)
  and quantification results (right; n = 6) are shown. H. Viability of PBX3-knocked
  down HCT116 cells cultured in the presence of nucleosides mixture (Nuc) and/or N-acetyl-L-cysteine
  (Nac), as measured on the third day after the addition of Nuc and/or Nac (n = 3).
  Cells transfected with shCon or pcCon were used as control. β-actin was used as
  western blotting loading control. Total protein was used for normalizing NADPH/NADP+
  level. Scale bars: 200 μm. Quantification data are shown as mean ± SD (n = 3; unless
  otherwise indicated); pcCon: pcEF9-Puro; **P < 0.01.'
