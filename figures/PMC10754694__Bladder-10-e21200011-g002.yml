caption: EMP1 deficiency inhibits bladder cancer cell migration and invasion, whereas
  overexpression promotes this process. (Aâ€“C) Correlation between EMP1 and levels
  of M1M2 ratio, M1, and M2, respectively. (D) Correlation matrix exhibiting the association
  between EMP1 and Myeloid cell development pathway. (E) Heatmap for the infiltration
  of immune cells with rows representing different kinds of immune cells and columns
  representing different samples with ECMI increasing from left to right. (F, G) GSEA
  running plot demonstrating the biological process of hallmark and KEGG enriched
  in EMP1 high and low. (H) qPCR of tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues of 32
  patients. (I) Western blot analysis of EMP1 expression in the normal bladder epithelial
  cell line SV-HUC-1 and seven bladder cancer cell lines (including HT-1197, RT-112,
  647-V, J82, EJ, T24, and UM-UC-3). * P < 0.05.
article_title: Single-cell analyses EMP1 as a marker of the ratio of M1/M2 macrophages
  is associated with EMT, immune infiltration, and prognosis in bladder cancer.
