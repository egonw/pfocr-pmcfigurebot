caption: 'Genetic origin and biosynthesis of the closoxazoles. A) Top: Closoxazole
  BGC of C. cavendishii (see also Table S6). Bottom: Scheme depicting the targeted
  knock‐out of clxA in the genome of C. cavendishii Rif1 by CRISPR/Cas9n‐mediated
  genome editing, alongside mutant verification by colony PCR and subsequent EcoRV
  restriction analysis of the resulting PCR fragment (unedited: 1012 bp; ΔclxA: 552
  and 460 bp). BS: biosynthesis. WT: wild type. B) Extracted ion chromatograms (EIC)
  corresponding to 11 and 12 are shown for crude ethyl acetate extracts of C. cavendishii
  Rif1, C. cavendishii Rif1ΔclxA, E. coli pET28a‐clxA–E (heterologous expression)
  and E. coli pET28a (vector control). EICs of the calculated exact mass of the compounds
  are shown with m/z ±5 ppm. C) EICs corresponding to closoxazoles and proposed biosynthetic
  intermediates detected in crude ethyl acetate extracts from E. coli strains expressing
  the listed combinations of clx genes along with the respective synthetic reference.
  (†) not related. D) Proposed closoxazole biosynthesis pathway in C. cavendishii
  and precursor‐directed biosynthesis in E. coli. Exogenous supply of the alternative
  starter unit 3,5‐dichlorobenzoic acid (3,5‐DCA) results in the production of the
  bioactive tafamidis analogue (25).'
