caption: NK cell response mode during COVID-19 infection. (A) Moderate COVID-19 patients
  have a gene overlap in NK cell subgroups (H_L_Group, L_H_Group, and L_Group). (B)
  Severe COVID-19 patients have a gene overlap in NK cell subgroups (H_L_Group, L_H_Group,
  and L_Group). (C) Summarize the impact on the H_L_Group and L_H_Group subgroups
  in the process of COVID-19 infection. (D) In NK cell subgroups, moderate patients
  (M) were compared with healthy controls (H). H_L_Group specific genes, L_H_Group
  specific genes, and genes common to all NK cell subgroups (Common_Group) KEGG pathway
  enrichment analysis, node size represents the number of genes, and color intensity
  represents -log10 q-value. (E) In NK cell subgroups, severe patients (S) were compared
  with moderate patients (M). H_L_Group specific genes, L_H_Group specific genes,
