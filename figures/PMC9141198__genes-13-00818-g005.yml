caption: FGFR1 is a target gene of miR-133a-3p and inhibits myoblast differentiation.
  (a) Vectors containing the FGFR1 wild-type (FGFR1-wild) and mutant (FGFR1-mut) sequences
  were constructed. The miR-133a-3p seed sequence and the FGFR1 mutant sequence are
  indicated in red and blue, respectively. (b) Luciferase assays revealed the suppressive
  effect of miR-133a-3p on the activity of FGFR1. (c) The expression level of FGFR1
  in MuSCs transfected with miR-133a-3p mimics or inhibitor. (d) The protein expression
  of FGFR1 in MuSCs transfected with miR-133a-3p mimics or inhibitor. (e) The expression
  pattern of FGFR1 in goat tissues. (f) The expression pattern of FGFR1 in the developmental
  LTL muscle. (g) qRT-PCR analysis of FGFR1 expression in MuSCs during 7 days of differentiation.
  (h) qRT-PCR analysis of FGFR1 expression in MuSCs transfected with pEGFP-FGFR1 or
  si-FGFR1 after 48 h in DM. (i) The protein expression of FGFR1 in MuSCs transfected
  with pEGFP-FGFR1 or si-FGFR1 after 48 h in DM. (j) qRT-PCR analysis of mRNA expression
  of MyoG and MyoD in MuSCs transfected with pEGFP-FGFR1 or si-FGFR1 then cultured
  in DM for 48 h. (k) Western blot analysis of MyoG and MyoD protein expression in
  MuSCs transfected with pEGFP-N1, pEGFP-FGFR1, si-NC, and si-FGFR1, respectively.
  Image Pro Plus software (version 6.0, Media Cybernetics) was used to compute the
  quantification of protein expression. Data are means Â± standard error of the mean
  of at least three biological replicates, * p < 0.05.
