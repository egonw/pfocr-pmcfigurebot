caption: The effects of CIAPIN1 gene silencing on the CCA cell lines. (a) Western
  blot analysis showing suppressed CIAPIN1 protein after gene silencing. (b) Western
  blot examined the relative expression of CIAPIN1 in CCA cell lines after gene silencing
  and normalization to β-actin expression. β-actin was used as a control for loading
  protein. scKKU-100 and scKKU213A are scramble-treated (without siRNA treatment)
  cells; siKKU-100 and siKKU213A are CIAPIN1-silenced-treated cells. The data were
  presented as the mean ± SD from triplicate independent experiments (* p < 0.05;
  ** p < 0.01).
