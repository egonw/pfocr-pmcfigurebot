caption: BTD inhibited the migration and invasion ability of cells. (A,B) Cells were
  treated with BTD (0, 2.5, 5, or 10 μM) for 24 h and subjected to migration (A) and
  invasion (B) assays, and then photographed (×100). (C) Cells were seeded, and a
  “wound” was created, then incubated with BTD (0, 2.5, 5, or 10 μM) for 24 h and
  photographed (×100). The lines indicate the area occupied by the initial scraping,
  and migrated cells were quantified. (D) The levels of MMP2, MMP9, and TIMP2 were
  detected using Western blotting. (E,F) Flow cytometry was used to analyze the cell
  cycle distribution. The values are shown as histograms.
