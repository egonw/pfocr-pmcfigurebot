caption: Willin/FRMD6 modulates a signaling pathway associated with neurodegeneration
  in primary neurons. (A) Quantification of phospho-p44/42 MAP Kinase (ERK1 and ERK2)
  immunoreactive bands relative to ERK1/2 in the indicated groups from primary cortical
  neuron lysates. Data are expressed as fold change relative to the scramble group.
  Representative immunoblots are shown underneath. n = 4–5 per group. ** p < 0.01.
  (B) Schematic diagram of the putative mechanism underlying Willin/FRMD6 involvement
  in AD pathogenesis. Aβ and amyloid pathology in AD increase mitochondrial ROS, leading
  to downregulation of Willin/FRMD6 expression, which leads to mitochondrial dysfunction
  and fragmentation in neuronal cells. These mitochondrial defects may be directly
  or indirectly mediated through Willin/FRMD6-induced activation of ERK signal transduction.
  Overexpression of Willin/FRMD6 rescues Aβ-induced mitochondrial perturbations.
