figure_title: Ca2+ and ROS signals are tightly interconnected
caption: Upon activation of PRR complexes during PTI, RLCKs activate Ca2+ channels
  leading to cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals. Ca2+ ions can directly activate the NADPH‐oxidase
  RBOHD through binding to its N‐terminal EF‐hands, but also induce the activity of
  Ca2+‐regulated kinases that phosphorylate the cytoplasmic N terminus of RBOHD (indicated
  by grey arrows targeting RBOHD p‐sites). In addition, RLCKs directly phosphorylate
  the N terminus and thereby activate RBOHD (indicated by black arrows targeting RBOHD
  p‐sites). Reactive oxygen species derived from RBOHD activity can be perceived by
  cysteine pairs of the RK HPCA1/CARD1. This is required for H2O2 induced Ca2+ signals
  in Arabidopsis, the signaling pathway downstream of HPCA1 activation is not known.
