caption: SPX promotes mice energy expenditure. (A) The oxygen consumption (VO2) of
  the mice during a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle. (D) the average values of VO2 for
  12 h dark periods against body weight, (G) ANCOVA predicted VO2 at a given body
  weight of 40 g. (B) The carbon dioxide production (VCO2) of the mice during a 12 h
  light/12 h dark cycle. (E) the average values of VCO2 for 12 h dark periods against
  body weight, (H) ANCOVA predicted VCO2 at a given body weight of 40g. (C) the average
  values of the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) of the mice during a 12 h light/12 h
  dark cycle. (F) the average values of RER for 12-h light/12-h dark periods. (I)
  the average values of energy expenditure (EE) for 12 h dark periods against body
  weight. (J) ANCOVA predicted EE at a given body weight of 40 g. All values are presented
  as means with error bars representing S.D. In the bar graph, *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01.
