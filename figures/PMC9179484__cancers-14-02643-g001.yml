caption: Activated RAS pathway is linked to romidepsin sensitivity. (a) Cells were
  treated with romidepsin (clinical dosing) and/or MEK inhibitor (MEKi, 250 nM) and/or
  AKT inhibitor (AKTi, 1 µM), and cell death was assessed at 48 h by annexin V-PI
  assay. Cell lines with a high expression of the multidrug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein
  were cotreated with P-gp inhibitor Tariquidar (Tq) to avoid the bias of drug efflux
  during the assessment of toxicity. Cells were hierarchically clustered according
  to percentage cell death, and a heatmap was drawn accordingly. Key DNA mutations
  and tissue origin of cancer are indicated below the heatmap. (b) The response to
  romidepsin in combination with either MEKi (left) or AKTi (right) for the 65 cell
  lines were plotted according to response to romidepsin alone (z-score). Cells were
  colored according to the four clusters obtained in (a). (c) SAM analysis was performed
  on NCI-60 panel gene expression between low responsive cluster (cluster 1) and each
  of the three others. SAM-ranked genes were analyzed with GSEA, and the significant
  enriched gene sets (FDR q-value < 0.05) obtained for each cluster was plotted according
  to normalized enrichment score (NES) and false discovery rate (FDR). (d). Leading-edge
  genes for “KRAS signaling up” signature obtained by GSEA analysis in clusters 2
  and 4 were hierarchically clustered according to their basal expression in the 65
  cell lines. (e) Athymic mice were injected with KRAS mutation bearing A549 cells
  forming tumor, then treated with romidepsin and/or MEKi for 28 days. Tumor size
  (median ± IQR) and mice weight () were measured over time, and tumor weight (median
  ± IQR) was measured after mice sacrifice and tumor dissection. Statistical difference
  between control and treated groups was determined using Welch’s t-test (unequal
  variance t-test), with * indicating a p-value < 0.05.
