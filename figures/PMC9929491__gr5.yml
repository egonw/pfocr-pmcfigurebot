caption: Osteogenesis enhancement induced by Sr-MBGNs scaffolds promoted NCPs secretion
  and Kindlin-2/PTH1R/OCN axis upregulation. a) GO enrichment analysis of osteogenesis
  function; b) Volcano plots indicating the differentially expressed upregulated and
  downregulated genes for Sr-MBGNs and GelMA group; c) The related upregulated genes
  collected from the GO enrichment of osteogenesis function presented in the heatmap;
  d) Schematic of the NCPs regulation mechanism (schematic created with BioRender.com);
  e) Representative Western blot analysis verifying the upregulation of the Kindlin-2/PTH1R/OCN
  axis at the protein level; f) KEGG pathway analysis screening the most correlated
  signaling pathways; g) IHC indicating the positive correlation between the expression
  level of OCN and PTH1R at 2 w and 4 w with HE staining used to display the bone
  defect region; h) immunofluorescent staining confirming the high expression level
  of Kindlin-2 in TIID BMSCs after 7 d incubation with 15Sr and 30Sr-MBGNs groups;
  i) immunofluorescent staining indicating the positive correlation between OCN and
  PTH1R for TIID BMSCs after 7 d incubation with the scaffolds.
