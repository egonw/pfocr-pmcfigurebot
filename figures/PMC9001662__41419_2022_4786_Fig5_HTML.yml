figure_title: Combination of LPS and HG increased apoptosis and pyroptosis rates in
  mRECs by enhancing the P2X7/NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway
caption: a Measured The protein expression levels of P2X7, NLRP3 inflammasome, Caspase
  1, Caspase 11, Caspase 3, and IL-18 under different conditions (5.5, 30 mM D- glucose,
  30 mM D- glucose + 100 µM BzATP, 30 mM D-glucose + 20 ng/ml LPS for 48 h using western
  blotting. b–d mRECs were cultured in HG (30 mM D-glucose) and HG + LPS (30 mM D-glucose
  combined + 20 ng/ml LPS) and apoptosis was assessed. e The extracellular ATP in
  mRECs was measured using an ATP bioluminescence assay kit at 15 and 45 min after
  stimulation of HG with or without LPS. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD (n = 3).
  *P < 0.05, *P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 vs. the control group.
