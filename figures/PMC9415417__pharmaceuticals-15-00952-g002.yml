caption: Molecular mechanism of CaMs on osteoclasts in CKD. Osteoblast and osteoclast
  proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis are influenced by local extracellular
  calcium concentrations. The activation of the RANK/RANKL signal from osteoblasts
  modulates osteoclastogenesis. The signal induces the elevation of endoplasmic reticulum
  stress (ER stress), which activates the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)
  phosphorylation. The downstream transcription of the nuclear factor of activated
  T cells, cytoplasmic (NFATc1) activates osteoclastogenesis. On the other hand, ER
  stress also activates the autophagy process to maintain osteoclast viability. RANK/RANKL
  also inhibits osteoclast apoptosis. CaMs induce the release of Wnt-10b from osteoclasts
  and inhibit the autophagy vial, activating the Akt/mTOR pathway. In this manner,
  CaMs increase bone formation, along with the apoptosis of the osteoclast.
