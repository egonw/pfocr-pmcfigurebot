caption: The potential mechanisms of non-coding RNAs in pituitary adenoma. (A) miRNA
  inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the 3’-UTR of mRNA. (B–D) miR-142-3p, miR-16,
  miR-146-5p, and exosome-derived miR-146-5p are involved in the pathogenesis of pituitary
  adenoma (PA). (E) LncRNA regulates gene activation or suppression by increasing
  or decreasing transcription via the transcription factor, respectively; antisense
  lncRNA upregulates the sense mRNA translation process. (F–H) MIR205GH, SNHG24, H19,
  and exosome-derived H19 are involved in the pathogenesis of PA. (I–J) CircVPS13C
  and hsa_circ_0001368 are involved in the pathogenesis of PA. (K) CircRNA and lncRNA
  increase the translation process and protein production via sponging miRNA. (L)
  LncRNA TUG1 modulates PA progression by regulating the TESC–NF-kB pathway via sponging
  miR-187-3p. (M) CircNFIX promotes PA progression by regulating CCNB1 via sponging
  miR-34a-5p.
