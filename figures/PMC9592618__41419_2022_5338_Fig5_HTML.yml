figure_title: Phosphorylation and acetylation of KIF15 is opposite to PI3K-C2α interaction
  and FA depolymerization
caption: A Schematic model demonstrated the conservation analysis of the acetylation
  and phosphorylation of KIF15 in various species. B Capture-Elisa assay analysis
  of the integrin β1 recycling content in acetylation of K1009 inactivating or activating
  mutant of KIF15, S1169 and P1142 inactivating and activating mutant. C The effect
  of acetylation of K1009 inactivating or activating mutant of KIF15, S1169, and P1142
  inactivating and activating mutant on the integrin β1/FAK pathway activity in whole
  cell lysis by western blot. D Immunofluorescence analysis of the acetylation of
  K1009 inactivating or activating mutant of KIF15, S1169 inactivating and activating
  mutant on the depolymerization of focal adhesions in PANC-1 cell. E The effect of
  K1009 activating mutant of KIF15, S1169 activating mutant on the integrin β1/FAK
  pathway activity in whole cell lysis by western blot and the interaction of KIF15,
  Rab11A Integrin β1, PI3K-C2α by Flag or HA immunoprecipitation assay. F Western
  blot analysis of the effects of K1009 deacetylation mutant of KIF15, S1169 activating
  mutant on integrin β1/FAK signaling in the wild-type or inactive state of RAB11A.
  All data represent means ± SEM; ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01; *P < 0.05; two-tailed
  Student’s t test.
