caption: MiR-217 is involved in IDD via the FBXO21/ERK axis. A, B The Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway and gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) identified
  the ERK signalling pathway as the most significantly enriched pathway in intervertebral
  disc degeneration. C Western blot analysis revealed that miR-217 overexpression
  or silencing affected the expression patterns of FBXO21, ERK, pERK, Col II, Aggrecan,
  MMP3, MMP13, and ADAMT5. D Western blot analysis was used to determine the expression
  levels of FBXO21, Col II, Aggrecan, MMP13, and ADAMT5. Overexpression of FBXO21
  effectively reversed the effects of miR-217 overexpression. E Coimmunoprecipitation
  revealed high-affinity physical interactions between FBXO21 and ERK. IDD, intervertebral
