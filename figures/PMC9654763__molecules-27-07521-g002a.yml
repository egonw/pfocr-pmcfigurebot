caption: 'Effect of Tab on neuroinflammation induced by LPS in BV2. After the cells
  were pretreated with Tab for 4 h, the supernatant was collected after being stimulated
  by LPS for 24 h. (A) The content of NO. (B) The protein was extracted. The effect
  of Tab on the expression of iNOS was detected by Western blot. (C) The relative
  expression of iNOS in (B). ### p < 0.001 vs. untreated control cells and *** p <
  0.001 vs. LPS-treated cells.'
