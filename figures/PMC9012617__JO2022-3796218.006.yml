caption: Baicalein inhibits the cancer-promoting effect of SMYD2. (a) Detection of
  SMYD2 overexpression efficiency in A549 and NCI-H1299 cells. (b) After different
  treatments, detection of SMYD2 expression in A549 and NCI-H1299 cells. (c) After
  different treatments, the expression of RPS7 in A549 and NCI-H1299 cells was detected.
  (d) After different treatments, the proliferation rate of A549 and NCI-H1299 cells
  was detected. (e) Detection of invasion ability of A549 and NCI-H1299 cells after
  different treatments. (f) After different treatments, the clone formation ability
  of A549 and NCI-H1299 cells was tested. ∗∗P < 0.01.
