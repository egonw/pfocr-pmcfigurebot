caption: Inhibited pathway of breast cancer regulation by stathmin 1 of 231BR cell
  line cultivated by Plasmax compared to DMEM. Blue line denotes that the corresponding
  protein change cause an inhibition to the function in Plasmax. Orange line denotes
  that the corresponding protein change cause an activation to the function in Plasmax,
  and yellow line denotes the inconsistent changes of corresponding proteins and their
  downstream molecules. The inset table provides the p-values and fold-change numbers
  of transcriptomes that are involved in this pathway.
