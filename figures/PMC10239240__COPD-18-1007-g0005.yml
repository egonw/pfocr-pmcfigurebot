caption: Schematic illustration of m6A modification involvement in IL-6/STAT3/SNAI1
  pathway and EMT in HBEC exposed to CSE. Inhaled cigarette smoking is primarily targeted
  at the airway epithelial cells. The activation of IL-6/STAT3/SNAI1 signaling triggers
  EMT processes in airway epithelial cells. Mettl3 induced by cigarette smoking inhibits
  the negative regulatory effect of SOCS3 on IL-6/STAT3/SNAI1 signaling, as it reduces
  the protein expression of SOCS3 through m6A methylation, which contributes to airway
  remodeling in COPD.
