caption: Integrin α6β4 signaling enhances NHEJ and suppresses HR. BT549 cells (EV,
  β4) were electroporated with pDRGFP (HR reporter; A) or pimEJ5GFP (NHEJ reporter;
  B) in the presence or absence of pCBASce-I plasmid, which expresses I-SceI endonuclease
  that causes DSB, plus pmCherry as a transfection control. After cells were plated
  on laminin-1-coated plates and treated with 5µM cisplatin for 48h, cells were analyzed
  GFP positive cells by flow cytometry using cotransfected pmCherry as a transfection
  control to determine relative repair efficiency (A, B). (C, D) BT549 cells (EV,
  β4) plated on laminin-1 coated plates were treated with 10µM cisplatin for 24h and
  assessed for cell cycle distribution using propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry
  analysis. Representative (C) and averaged (D) cell cycle distributions are shown.
  Data are representative of 3 experiments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.001, ***p < 0.0001.
