caption: Mechanisms of interaction between gut microbiota and ICI-related colitis.
  On the basis of the known interaction between gut microbiota and IRC, the main mechanisms
  included direct effect, metabolites, cytokines, and immune cells. For protective
  bacteria, the pro-inflammatory pathways like IL-1b and TNF-a are inhibited, together
  with promoted anti-inflammatory pathways including IL-10, Th17 cells, and Treg cells.
  They also modulate the differentiation of T cells through vitamin B and tricarboxylic
  acid cycle. Butyrate produced by bacteria exerts anti-inflammatory effect via various
  aspect like consolidating tight junction, inducing IL-10 and suppressing NF-κB.
  As for harmful bacteria, they secrete some enzymes to destruct mucin and enhance
  the pro-inflammatory pathway like IL-6, TNF-a, CRP, and antigen production. TCA,
  tricarboxylic acid; NF-kB, nuclear factor kappa B; TLR, toll-like receptor; TNF-a,
  tumor necrosis factor-a; IL, interleukin; CRP, C-reactive protein.
