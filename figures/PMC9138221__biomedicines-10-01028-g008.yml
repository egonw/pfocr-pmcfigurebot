caption: 'Exercise memetic—AICAR promotes angiogenesis through CHI3L1/PAR2-PI3K-AKT/ERK-eNOS
  signaling pathway in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). (A) Representative
  pictures of western blotting for detection of CHI3L1, PAR2, total and phosphorylated
  PI3K, AKT, ERK, and eNOS protein expression in HUVEC under various drug treatments.
  (B) Bar graph shows densitometric analysis of western blotting bands (n = 3/group).
