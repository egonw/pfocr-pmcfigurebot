caption: Changes in TGFβ signaling and SMAD2/3 nuclear localization in mice with reduced
  PTP1B expression in vascular smooth muscle cells. Western blot analysis of SMAD2
  phosphorylation in human aortic SMCs following siRNA-mediated downregulation of
  PTP1B. Representative Western blot membranes are shown in panel (A) , and the results
  of the quantitative analysis of phosphorylated (p)-SMAD2 levels in n =4 experimental
  replicates in shown in panel (B) . Primary murine aortic SMCs were grown on coverslips
  and the subcellular presence of p-SMAD2 ( C ; red signal ) and p-SMAD3 ( D ; red
  signal ), at baseline and following stimulation with recombinant TGFβ1 (10ng/mL
  for 60minutes), was examined using fluorescence microscopy. Cell nuclei were stained
  with DAPI ( blue signal ). Size bars represent 25µm. Western blot analysis of total
  MYH10, PDGFRβ, SMAD2, and ERK1/2 protein levels and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in human
  aortic SMCs following siRNA-mediated downregulation of SMAD2. A representative Western
  blot membrane is shown in panel (E) , and the results of the quantitative analysis
  in n =4–7 experimental replicates in panels (F)–(I) . Graphs show individual values
  as well as the mean±SEM. Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t -test.
  (J) Total RNA was isolated from carotid arteries 21 days after FeCl 3 -induced injury
  and changes in the mRNA expression of TGFβ pathway signaling components analyzed
  using RT2 PCR Profiler array. A heatmap showing -fold changes in mRNA transcript
  levels in SMC.PTP1B-KO mice (mean of n =3 mice) versus SMC.PTP1B-WT controls (mean
  of n =3) is shown. Upregulated factors are red , and downregulated factors are blue
  . PCR, polymerase chain reaction; SEM, standard error of the mean; SMC, smooth muscle
  cell.
