caption: 'Effects of ischemia and reperfusion on Neu3 expression and Sialidase-3 activity.
  (A) Expression of sialidase Neu3 measured by real time PCR; (B) enzymatic activity
  of sialidase-3 measured on the synthetic substrate 4-Mu-NeuAc. Data are expressed
  as relative quantities compared with H9c2 not exposed to IRI and collected at the
  beginning of the experiments (Time 0 dashed line). Each square in the graphs represent
  an experimental replicate. Statistical significance was determined by the nonparametric
  Kruskal-Wallis test. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01. The # symbol indicates the statistical
  significance as compared to 30â€² ischemia. # p < 0.05; ## p < 0.01.'
