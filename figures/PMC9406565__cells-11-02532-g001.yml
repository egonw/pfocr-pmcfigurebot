caption: 'The sphingomyelin pathway and synthesis of compound AKS466. (a) Scheme sphingomyelin
  pathway, (b) introduction of an amide (blue) and a bio-orthogonal functional group
  (red) for click-reactions. The compound was synthesized as a racemate and as (R)-
  and (S)-enantiomers (see Supporting Materials). Abbreviations: DCM: dichloromethane,
  DIAD: diisopropyl azodicarboxylate, DMF: N,N-dimethylformamide, HATU: 1-[Bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazolo
  [4,5-b]pyridinium 3-oxide hexafluoro-phosphate, THF: tetrahydrofurane.'
