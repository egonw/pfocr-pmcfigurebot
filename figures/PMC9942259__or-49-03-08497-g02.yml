caption: LAPTM5 promotes migration and invasion of breast cancer. (A and B) Cell metastatic
  ability was evaluated by wound healing assay at 0 and 24 h. The relative migration
  ratio was statistically analyzed. Scale bar, 200 µm. (C and D) Cell invasive ability
  was detected by Transwell assay. Number of invasive cells was statistically analyzed.
  Scale bar, 100 µm. (E and F) Protein expression of MMP2, MMP9, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin
  was examined by western blotting. Data originated from three independent experiments
  and are presented as the mean ± SD. *P<0.05 and **P<0.01. LAPTM5, lysosomal protein
  transmembrane 5; MMP, matrix metallopeptidase; ns, not significant; sh-, short hairpin;
  NC, negative control.
article_title: LAPTM5 regulated by FOXP3 promotes the malignant phenotypes of breast
  cancer through activating the Wnt/β‑catenin pathway.
