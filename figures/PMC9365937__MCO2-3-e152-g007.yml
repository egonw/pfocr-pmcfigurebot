caption: 'Focal adhesion is involved in Glutathione peroxidase 8 (GPX8)‐regulated
  metastasis in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). (A) The heatmap analysis based on RNA‐seq
  after knockdown of GPX8 in A549 cells. (B and C) The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
  and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis based on RNA‐seq after knockdown of GPX8. (D)
  The protein levels of focal adhesion pathway in A549 and NCI‐H1975 cells with downregulation
  of GPX8 were detected by Western blot analysis. (E) The colocalization of p‐Paxillin
  and F‐actin in A549 and NCI‐H1975 cells with downregulation of GPX8 was conducted
  using immunofluorescence. Scale bar: 10 µm. (F) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
  analysis of focal adhesion, extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor interaction and
  regulation of actin cytoskeleton signatures between GPX8 high and low group in TCGA_LUAD
  dataset'
