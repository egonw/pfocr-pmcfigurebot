caption: Molecular targets of hemocyanin and the adaptive immune response associated
  with C-type lectin receptor and TLR-4. The model shows that hemocyanins cooperate
  with mannose receptors and TLR4 at the cell surface of APC, to initiate a proinflammatory
  response. Hemocyanins activate TLR4 to stimulate MAPK-dependent downstream signaling
  pathways, as shown in . In addition, hemocyanins are endocytosed and activate the
  Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adapter-inducing IFNβ (TRIF)
  pathway. As an adjuvant, hemocyanin stimulates innate immune cells to induce Th1-cell
  adaptive immune responses.
