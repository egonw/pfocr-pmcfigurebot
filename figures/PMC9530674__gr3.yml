caption: High-fat-diet synergized with repeated exposure to radiation variation from
  high dose to low dose induces significant impact on gut microbiome in mice. A. Analysis
  of Beta diversity among 4 groups used to compare the difference in gut microbiota
  composition among 4 groups by QIME software through unweighted unifrac method. B.
  Heatmap of gut microbiota abundance among 4 groups. Color represents abundance.
  Color from red to blue means relative abundance increased from high to low. C. Gut
  microbiota distribution columnar diagram among 4 groups. Various color represents
  various species. D. Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio among 4 groups. E. Relative abundance
  of Fusobacteria among 4 groups. F. Relative abundance of Actlnobacterla among 4
  groups. G. Relative abundance of Akkermansia mucinipila among 4 groups. H. Relative
  abundance of Butyrlcococcus among 4 groups. I. Relative abundance of Clostridiaceae
  among 4 groups.J. Picrust2 software is used to annotate the characteristic sequence
  to be predicted with the existing phylogenetic tree in the software, and img microbial
  genome data is used to output functional information, so as to speculate the functional
  gene composition in the sample, so as to analyse the functional differences between
  different groups (). COG(Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins) analysis to
  predict the difference changed gut microbiota function. K. Potential KEGG (Kyoto
  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway analysis was used to predict changes
  in metabolic pathways of functional genes of microbial communities among samples
  in different groups. Data are means ± standard deviation (SD), n = 5 per group.
  Mann-Whitney test or two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test were used for statistical
  analyses. *p < 0.05 indicates significant difference.
