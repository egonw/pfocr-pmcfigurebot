caption: Illustration of a multiple pathway theory that includes separate paths for
  feature contrast and object properties. Relevant stimuli are initially processed
  in terms of their simple features and then, depending on the task, take one of two
  paths to reach decision and response processes. The arrows on the left represent
  an unlimited-capacity pathway that can be followed when the task depends only on
  a decision about feature contrast. The arrows on the right represent a limited-capacity
  pathway that must be followed if the task requires object processing.
