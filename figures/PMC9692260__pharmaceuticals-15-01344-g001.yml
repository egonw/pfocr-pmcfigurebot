caption: 'The illustrated mechanisms propose the pathogenesis of diabetic CVD. Hyperglycemia
  is the main culprit that induces and enhances the activation of fatty acid metabolism
  and nonoxidative glucose pathways, AGEs, polyol, hexosamine, and PKC pathways, which
  cause high generation of ROS. ROS causes downregulation of Nrf2, which reduces the
  activity and level of endogenous antioxidants, which ultimately causes oxidative
  stress. ROS also triggers the activation of NF-κB and raises the inflammasome, NLRP3,
  and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, MCP-1, ICAM-1, VCAM-1), which leads
  to inflammation. The inflammatory response upregulates TGF-β and triggers the profibrotic
  response, as well as CTGF, which further causes ECM accumulation, collagen deposition,
  and, in the end, fibrosis. ROS causes mitochondrial dysfunction and further enhances
  oxidative stress. Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress triggers the cascade
  of apoptosis by activating apoptosomes and caspases. These mechanisms ultimately
  cause cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, endothelial dysfunction, vascular stiffness,
  myocardial ischemia, and ultimately, diabetic CVD. Abbreviations: AGE, advanced
  glycation end product; PKC, protein kinase C; ROS, reactive oxygen species; Nrf2,
  nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells; NLRP3, NLR family pyrin domain containing 3; TNF-α, tumor
  necrosis factor alpha; IL, Interleukin; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1;
  ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1; VCAM-1, vascular cell adhesion protein
  1; CTGF, connective tissue growth factor; ECM, extracellular matrix; TGF-β, transforming
  growth factor beta ; Apaf-1, apoptotic protease activating factor 1. Arrow represent
  the subsequent event/product in the pathway.'
