caption: Lung cancer suppression due to TLR knockout is associated with decreased
  proliferation and angiogenesis. Representative photomicrographs of lung immunohistochemistry
  that are positive for Ki-67 (A), and ERG (C) (20x magnification, scale bar=100um).
  Accompanied by quantitative analysis (right panels) represented as a percentage
  of positive KI-67 (n=4-5) (B) and ERG cells (n=6-9) (D). Data represent mean ± SEM;
  experimental groups are separately compared to CC-LR cohort, where *p< 0.05 by unpaired
  t-test.

  airway inflammation on K-ras-driven lung cancer through activation of the MyD88/NF-ĸB
  pathway in the airway epithelium.
