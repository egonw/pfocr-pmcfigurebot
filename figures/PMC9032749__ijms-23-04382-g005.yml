caption: 'Effect of K-8-K and S-10-S on the inflammatory response in Caco-2 cells
  treated with 0.01 mg/mL LPS. The levels of TNF-α were measured by ELISA assay in
  supernatants of Caco-2 cells grown for 14 days and pretreated with the peptides
  (0.05 mg/mL) for 24 h. Here, 0.01 mg/mL LPS was used as inflammatory stimulus. Means
  of at least three replicates estimated in duplicate were compared (*** p < 0.001,
  ** p < 0.01). Cnt: untreated cells.'
