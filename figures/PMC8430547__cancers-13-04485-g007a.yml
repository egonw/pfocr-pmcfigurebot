caption: (A) Gene set enrichment analysis of pathways enriched in U87-MG cells after
  treatment with CAP + TMZ. (B,C) Dot and ridge plots of top 10 altered processes
  in most enriched pathways. (D) Heatmap comparison of upregulated genes (relative
  to control) of the cell cycle signaling pathway in U87-MG cells post-treatment with
  CAP, TMZ, or CAP + TMZ. (E) Heatmap comparison of downregulated genes of the cell
  cycle signaling pathway in U87-MG cells post-treatment. (F) Gene set enrichment
  analysis of the cell cycle pathway using the Reactome database resulted in a Normalized
  Enrichment Score (NES) = âˆ’1.79, Nominal p-value = 0.025. A negative NES indicated
  cell cycle gene sets are downregulated and negatively correlated. (G) KEGG pathway
  analysis of cell cycle genes regulated by CAP + TMZ in U87-MG cells.
