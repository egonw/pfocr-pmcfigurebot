caption: BTD suppressed cell proliferation. (A) Proliferation of HCT116, HT29, and
  CT26 cells was evaluated using MTT assays. Cells were treated with BTD (2.5, 5,
  or 10 μM) or vehicle for 24–72 h. (B) Cell morphology changes were observed by optical
  microscopy (×200). Cells were treated with a gradient concentration of BTD (0, 0.3125,
  0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 μM) for 24 h. (C) Colony formation of HCT116 and CT26
  cells after treatment with BTD. The results are presented as surviving colonies.
  (D) EdU staining assays showed the replication of DNA in HCT116 and CT26 cells treated
  with BTD (5 or 10 μM) or vehicle. Blue staining indicates the cell nucleus, and
  green staining indicates duplicated cells.
