caption: Palmitic acid phosphorylates STAT3 and promotes LAMC1 secretion through miR-193a-3p.
  (A) AGS cells treated with 0.5mM palmitic acid for 48h was used for mass spectrometry
  analysis and the three most abundant pathway proteins were shown. (B) The western
  blots were for analyzing pathway protein expression in AGS cells after treatment
  with 0.5mM palmitic acid for 48h or reverse coculture with 3T3-L1 supernatant induced
  by 0 and 100ng/ml LAMC1 for 48h. 10uM DC260126 was used to inhibit the effect of
  palmitic acid. (C) AGS cells transfected with siSTAT3 had a low LAMC1 expression
  determined by RT-qPCR, Western blots. (D) LAMC1 expression in supernatant of AGS
  cells transfected with siSTAT3. (E) Flowchart of co-culture of gastric cancer cell
  supernatant and 3T3-L1. (F) The gastric cancer cell supernatant transfected with
  siSTAT3 for 48h was collected to coculture with 3T3-L1 for 5 days. Western blots
  and the Oil Red O staining were used for lipid formation ability. (G) Three independent
  miRNA target databases were used to predict the potential miRNAs. (H) RT-qPCR was
  for analyzing miR193a-3p, miR384 and miR448 expression levels in AGS cells with
  STAT3 overexpression. (I) The gastric cancer cell supernatant transfected with miR-193a-3p
  mimic, inhibitor or NC for 48h was collected to coculture with 3T3-L1 for 5 days,
  and the Oil Red O staining and Western blots were used for lipid formation ability.
