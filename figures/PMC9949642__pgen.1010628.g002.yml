caption: (A) Images show epidermal cells of the indicated L3/L4 stage animals expressing
  mCherry::DIS-3 and RRP-8::GFP after 4°C for 3 hours. Scale bars, 5 μm. (B) Images
  of epidermal cells expressing RBD-1::mCherry, GFP::NUCL-1 or C27F2.4::GFP after
  4°C for 3 hours at the L3/L4 stage. Scale bars, 5 μm. (C) Images of epidermal cells
  expressing GFP::RPOA-2 and mCherry::FIB-1 after 4°C for 3 hours at the L3/L4 stage.
  Scale bars, 5 μm. (D) Alleles of glr-3(ust166), asp-17(ust190) and zip-10(ust192)
  used in this study. The deletion alleles of ust166, ust190 and ust192 were constructed
  by CRISPR/Cas9 technology. All three alleles were likely null alleles. (E) Images
  of the localization of EXOS-10 in the indicated animals after 4°C for 3 hours. Images
  were taken from epidermal cells. Scale bars, 10 μm. (F) The curve graph represents
  the percentage of animals with nucleolus-enriched EXOS-10 in epidermal cells at
  4°C for 3 hours. n ≥ 20 animals.
