figure_title: EF reduces LPS-induced inflammatory mediator production in a manner
  dependent on the Nrf2 pathway
caption: a–c RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with or without ML385 (10 μM) for 0.5 h
  before EF (100 μM) treatment, and 0.5 h later, the cells were stimulated with LPS
  (100 ng/mL) for another 24 h. a Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting to
  measure the expression of iNOS, and β-actin was used as a loading control. b The
  ratios of iNOS/β-actin were calculated by ImageJ software. c Culture supernatant
  was collected for NO detection. d RAW264.7 cells were treated with EF (0, 3, 10,
  30, and 100 μM) for 0.5 h before coincubation with LPS (100 ng/mL) for 0.5 h. Nuclear
  fractions were extracted and subjected to immunoblot analysis using Nrf2 antibody
  and Lamin B antibody. e RAW264.7 cells were treated with EF (100 μM) for 0.5 h before
  coincubation with LPS (100 ng/mL) for 0.5 h. Then, the cells were used for immunofluorescence
  analysis and stained with anti-Nrf2 (red) and DAPI (blue). Images were obtained
  by confocal microscopy. Data are shown as the mean ± SEM, n = 3, *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01.
