caption: Transcriptome analysis of the DEGs in T8.66 compared with WT HB0801. (A)
  The volcano map of DEGs between T8.66 and HB0801. The x-axis is the log2 fold change,
  and the y-axis is the âˆ’log10 (P-value). The horizontal line is the threshold of
  P-value =0.05. Red dots indicate gene upregulation, and green dots indicate gene
  downregulation. Gray dots denote genes with no significant change. (B) Bubble chart
  of GO enrichment analysis of DEGs. P-values range from 0 to 1. The size of the dot
  denotes the number of DEGs. The gene ratio is the number of the DEGs to the number
  of annotated genes. (C) Bubble chart of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
  (KEGG) pathway analysis. The y-axis is the different KEGG pathways, and the x-axis
  is the gene ratio, which represents the ratio of the number of DEGs to the total
  number of annotated genes in this pathway. The size of the dot correlates with the
  number of DEGs annotated in the pathway. (D) Validation of RNA-seq results by qRT-PCR.
