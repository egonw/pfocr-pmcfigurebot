caption: Pathways significantly associated with a. treatment arm b. post-treatment
  vitamin D sufficiency (25(OH)D ng/ml). For each pathway, results are obtained from
  a multivariable logistic model including the post-treatment clr-transformed abundance
  of the pathway as covariate and adjusted for confounders. The bar length indicates
  the significant beta-coefficient of the pathway (p < 0.05). If positive, the pathway
  was significantly more abundant in patients a. supplemented with vitamin D b. reaching
  vitamin D sufficiency at the end of the treatment. If negative, the pathway was
  significantly more abundant in patients a. in the placebo group b. not reaching
  vitamin D sufficiency at the end of the treatment. 25(OH)D = 25-hydroxy vitamin
  D.
