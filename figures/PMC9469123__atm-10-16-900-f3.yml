caption: Micro CT cross-sectional scanning image of lumbar vertebrae in rats. Compared
  with the control group, the osteoporosis was obvious in the PMOP group. And the
  trabecular bone of PMOP + ZGZT group and PMOP + E2 group was denser than that of
  PMOP group, but the trabecular bone was slightly loose compared with that of control
  group. Both PMOP + ZGZT group and PMOP + E2 group could partially alleviate osteoporosis.
  PMOP, postmenopausal osteoporosis; ZGZT, Zhuanggu Zhitong; E2, estrogen.
