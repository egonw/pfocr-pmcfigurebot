caption: Increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 viral infection upon expression of
  scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1) and rerouting of SREBP pathway to cytokine
  production. SR-B1 is one of the cell-surface proteins acting as HDL receptor and
  mainly involved in the uptake of cholesteryl esters (CE). According to recent views,
  SR-B1 expression facilitates SARS-CoV-2 adhesion to the host-cell membrane via an
  indirect mechanism whereby SARS-CoV-2 virus (2) binds to the HDL-CE complexes (1)
  forming HDL-CE-virus supramolecular assemblies. The HDL-CE complexes are recognized
  by SR-B1 (4) while the virus cargo is recognized by its cognate receptor, ACE2 (step
  5) []. Under normal conditions, SREBP2 activity increases cholesterol biosynthesis;
  in SARS-CoV-2 infection the ER-resident protein is translocated to the nucleus (6)
  and increases the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (7). AM580
  (chemical formula shown in top-right) is a stable benzoic derivative of retinoic
  acid. The drug targets SRBP2.
