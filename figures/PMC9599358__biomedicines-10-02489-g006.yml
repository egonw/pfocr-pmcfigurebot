caption: 'The effects in cell viability and in the colony formation mediated by c-Myc
  inhibition are counteracted by mevalonate supplementation. PaCa44 and PT45 cells
  were treated with cMyc inhibitor (i-cMyc) (50 μM) or MEV (20 μM) or with both for
  48 h to evaluate cell viability and colony formation. (A) Cell survival was evaluated
  by trypan blue exclusion assay. The histograms represent the mean plus SD of live
  cells as percentage of untreated control cells, p value: * <0.05; ** <0.01; ****
  <0.0001; (B) representative pictures of Paca44 and PT45 colonies stained with crystal
  violet and histograms of quantitative analyses of colony formation are shown. The
  numbers of untreated colonies were set to 100. Results are presented as mean ± SD
  of percent. p value: * <0.05; ** <0.01; ****<0.0001.'
