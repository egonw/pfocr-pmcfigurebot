caption: Study schema of SCRUM-Japan GI-SCREEN. Patients with advanced gastrointestinal
  cancers were enrolled in the SCRUM-Japan GI-SCREEN involving 26 core cancer institutions
  in Japan. Tumor tissue samples from the enrolled patients were analyzed using the
  Oncomine Comprehensive Assay. Clinicopathologic information and efficacy data of
  systemic therapy were collected using an electronic data capture system and were
  finalized by completion of the resolution of autogenerated and manually added queries
  from the SCRUM-Japan Data Center. The collected data were used to assign patients
  to targeted clinical trials, generate real-world evidence, and perform clinicogenomic
  analysis. MSI, microsatellite instability.
