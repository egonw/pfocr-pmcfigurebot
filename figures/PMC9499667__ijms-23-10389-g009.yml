caption: 'ApStat regulates ApSOCS-2 expression in silkworm challenged with M. luteus
  at 6 and 12 h normalized to 18S and actin-1 (Actin-1 normalized: ). The efficiency
  of ApStat-RNAi in fat bodies (A) and hemocytes (D). (C,D) After dsApStat injection,
  the ApSOCS-2 expression in fat bodies of silkworm challenged with M. luteus at 6
  (B) and 12 h (C) was detected by qRT-PCR in fat bodies. Following dsApStat injection,
  the ApSOCS-2 expression in hemocytes of silkworm challenged with M. luteus at 6
  (E) and 12 h (F) was detected by qRT-PCR. The GFP-RNAi was used as the control.
