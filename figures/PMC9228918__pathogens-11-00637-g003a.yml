caption: Inhibition of ATM and CHK2 reduces the proliferation/viability of HPV-positive
  cervical cancer-derived cell lines and induces the accumulation of sub-G1 cells.
  The activity of ATM and CHK2 kinases was inhibited using (A) caffeine (an inhibitor
  of ATM and ATR), (B) a specific inhibitor ATM and (C) a specific inhibitor of CHK2.
  Cells were seeded in 96 wells plates (5000 cells/well). Cells were treated with
  the inhibitors for 72 h and their proliferation was assessed by Alamar Blue reduction.
  (D) The distribution of cells populations in the different phases of the cell cycle
  was determined by flow cytometry. Results presented are representative of three
  independent experiments (Student t-test p < 0.05 [*], p < 0.01 [**], p < 0.001 [***],
  p < 0.0001 [****] for comparisons between control and treated cells).
