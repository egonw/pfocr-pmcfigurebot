caption: 'Proposed biosynthetic pathway leading to the formation of 1 and 2. (A) DMAPP
  and IPP are probably formed via the mevalonate pathway. (B) The squalene formation
  is presumably catalyzed via a three-step pathway (HpnCDE) using the enzymes hydroxysqualene
  synthase (HpnC), presqualene diphosphate synthase (HpnD), and hydroxysqualene dehydroxylase.
  (C) The presence of different “stage 2” genes within the genome of Na p20, which
  encode numerous modification enzymes requiring molecular oxygen for catalysis, lead
  probably to the formation of 4,4-dimethylcholesta-8,14,24-trien-3-ol, zymosterol,
  and cholesta-7,24-dien-3-ol, which have been previously discovered from different
  myxobacterial strains. (D) Unidentified tailoring enzymes are likely decorating
  the sterol scaffold of cholesterol (or another closely related derivative) to yield
  1 and 2. Identified gene homologues of biosynthetic proteins within the genome of
  Na p20 are marked in blue boxes. HMGS: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase;
