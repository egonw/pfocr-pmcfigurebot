caption: 'The effect of RA on the mRNA expression levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, SOD,
  CAT, and GPx in CP-induced acute liver and kidney injury. The mRNA expression levels
  of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, SOD, CAT, and GPx in the liver and kidney of mice were measured
  by qRT–PCR (a–f). These experiments were repeated three times. * and # denote significant
  differences (p < 0.05) and ** and ## denote highly significant differences (p <
  0.01) compared with the control and CP model groups, respectively.'
