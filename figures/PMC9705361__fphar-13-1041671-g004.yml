caption: 'CP-25 inhibited the activation of MAPK pathway and nuclear translocation
  of NF-κB mediated by ROS in vivo. (A) Representative micrographs of ROS production
  in liver tissues were stained with DHE (Scale bar = 100 μm), and was quantitated
  by measuring the fluorescence intensity. (B) Representative immunoblotting bands
  of p-JNK, p-ERK and p-p38 in ConA-injected mice were showed, the semi-quantitative
  analysis was shown as the bar diagram. Densitometry values were expressed as-fold
  change relative to the normal group. (C) Representative images of NF-κB nuclear
  translocation in liver tissues were detected by immunohistochemistry staining (Scale
  bar = 50 μm). Results from three independent experiments are reported as the means
  ± SD. **p < 0.01 versus normal, # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01 versus model, & p < 0.05,
  && p < 0.01 versus paeoniflorin.'
