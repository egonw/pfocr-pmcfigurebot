caption: 'Proposed PUFA biosynthetic machinery in eukaryotic PUFA synthases. Different
  domains are indicated by colors. ACP, acyl carrier protein domain; MAT, malonyl-CoA:
  ACP transacylase domain; KS, ketoacyl-ACP synthase domain; CLF, chain length factor
  domain; KR, ketoacyl-ACP reductase domain; DHPKS, PKS-like dehydratase domain; DHFabA,
  FabA-like dehydratase domain; ER, enoyl-ACP reductase domain; AT, acyltransferase
  domain. Dotted arrows indicate possible reactions, and domains with dashed outlines
  indicate their possible involvement in related reactions. The atoms lost in the
  decarboxylation of malonyl-ACP are shown in red. Different background colors are
  given to different parts of Î²-ketoacyl-ACP formed by condensation.'
