figure_title: Overview of cGAS activation and cGAS-STING signaling
caption: cGAS binds to both pathogen-derived and host organelles-derived DNA in the
  cytosol and micronuclei, which then forms cGAS-DNA 2:2 complexes. These complexes
  undergo phase separation to further assemble into larger oligomers with liquid-like
  biophysical properties. These cGAS-DNA condensates allow efficient catalytic action
  of cGAS, which turns ATP and GTP into cGAMP. cGAMP binds to STING on the ER membrane,
  which in turn traffics to the ERGIC/Golgi and oligomerizes. Activated STING recruits
  TBK1 that phosphorylates STING at its C-terminal tail (CTT). IRF3 is recruited to
  the pLxIS motif among the phosphorylated residues at the CTT of STING, then gets
  phosphorylated by TBK1. Phosphorylated IRF3 dimers and translocates to the nucleus,
  where it induces the transcription of type I IFN and proinflammatory cytokines in
  collaboration with NF-κB, which is also activated by TBK1 and IKKε downstream of
  STING.
