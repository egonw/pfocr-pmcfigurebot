caption: (A) The expression level of GA synthesis and metabolism-related genes in
  the seeds of wild-type-NIP and pnfyc mutants that germinated for 6 h. (B) The expression
  level of ABA biosynthesis and negative signal pathway-related genes in the seeds
  of wild-type-NIP and pnfyc mutants that germinated for 6 h. (C) The expression level
  of starch synthesis-related genes in wild-type-NIP and pnfyc mutant seeds 7 days
  after pollination. Data are shown as means ± SD of at least three biological replicates.
  (** p < 0.01 by two-tailed Student’s t-test).
