caption: RNA-seq analysis of mouse BLCA cell lines treated with 100 U rIFNα or LV-IFNα(A–F)
  Heatmaps of significant genes (FDR cutoff 0.05 and fold change of 2) between 100 U
  IFNα and CTRL samples for BBN975 (A), MB49 (B), and UPPL1541 (C) and between LV-IFNα
  and LV-Ctrl samples for BBN975 (D), MB49 (E), and UPPL1541 (F). (G and H) Venn diagrams
  show significantly altered genes (FDR cutoff 0.05 and fold change of 1.5) common
  or unique to all the three cell lines after treatment with LV-IFNα and rIFNα. (I
  and J) GSEA shows enrichment of interferon alpha response pathway in MB49 cells
  treated with LV-IFNα and rIFNα.
