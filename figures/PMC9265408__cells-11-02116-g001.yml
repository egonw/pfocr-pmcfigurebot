caption: The miRNA–TF gene regulatory network and hub nodes in HCC. (A) Heatmap for
  differentially expressed TFs in HCC tumor vs. adjacent tissues. The color gradient
  from blue to red indicates the scaled expression (Z score) from low to high. (B)
  Result of KEGG pathway enrichment analysis for differentially expressed genes (DEGs).
  (C) miRNA–TF–gene FFL regulatory network for all DEGs and differentially expressed
  miRNAs (DEMs). TFs, miRNAs and their target gene(s) are indicated in triangles,
  rounded rectangles and circles, respectively. Genes upregulated and down-regulated
  in all patient tumor samples are indicated in red and blue, respectively. Purple
  edges indicate TF–target regulation, while red edges indicate miRNA–target regulation.
  (D) The miR-9-5p–TF gene regulatory network. (E) The miR-9-5p–FOXO1–CPEB3 FFL.
