caption: Canonical IRS signaling pathway adapted from []. IRS proteins mainly induce
  the activations of the PI3K-AKT and MAPK pathways. After the binding of receptor
  tyrosine kinases, IRS proteins are phosphorylated by their tyrosine residues and
  this activation triggers the IRS-induced signaling pathways. Activations of IRS
  proteins are regulated through Ser/Thr phosphorylations as a feedback mechanism
  of their downstream targets.
