caption: (A) Representative confocal microscopy images of MCF‐7 cells stained using
  Hoechst 33258 nuclear stain along with propidium iodide and captured at 63× magnification.
  Upper panel showing control MCF‐7 cells (DMSO 0.1%) and Lower panel MCF‐7 cells
  treated with Chloroxylon swietenia leaves methanol extract (CSLME) (20 μg/ml) showing
  apoptotic fragmented nuclear morphology. (B) Agarose gel image showing DNA fragmentation
  in MCF‐7 cells induced by CSLME treatment. DNA extracted from control and different
  concentration of CSLME (10, 20, 30, and 40 μg/ml) treated cells was resolved on
  1% agarose gel by electrophoresis. Lane 1‐ Marker, lane 2‐ control, lane 3–10 μg/ml,
  lane 4–20 μg/ml, lane 5–30 μg/ml, and lane 6–40 μg/ml of CSLME treated MCF‐7 cells
  respectively
