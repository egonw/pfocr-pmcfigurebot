caption: 'Protein assay of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and autophagy in NIH-3T3
  cells. (a)Western blotting was applied to detect the expression of AKT, p-AKT, mTOR,
  p-mTOR, Beclin-1, p62, and LC3-II/LC3-I; (b)Quantitative analysis of the Western
  blotting results (a) #P < 0.05 vs. AngII, ##P < 0.01 vs. AngII; ∗P < 0.05 vs. SXSM,
  and ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. SXSM. CON: control group cells. Ang II: cells treated with AngII.
  SXSM: cells treated with AngII and SXSM. SC79: cells treated with AngII, SXSM, and
  SC79. AngII: angiotensin II; SXSM: Shenxian-Shengmai oral liquid; SC79: AKT phosphorylation
  agonist.'
