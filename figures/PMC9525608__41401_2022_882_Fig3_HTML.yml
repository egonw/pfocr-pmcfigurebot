figure_title: CHMFL-26 can effectively inhibit the phosphorylation of HER2 and its
  downstream signaling pathway, arrest cell cycle progression, induce cell apoptosis
  and inhibit cell colony formation in BT-474, OE19, and NCI-N87 cells
caption: a Effects of CHMFL-26 on the HER2 signaling pathway in BT-474, OE19, and
  NCI-N87 cells. b Effects of CHMFL-26 on apoptosis pathways. c Effects of CHMFL-26
  on cell cycle progression. d Effects of CHMFL-26 on the colony formation inhibition
  of BT-474, OE19, and NCI-N87 cells.
article_title: CHMFL-26 is a highly potent irreversible HER2 inhibitor for use in
  the treatment of HER2-positive and HER2-mutant cancers.
