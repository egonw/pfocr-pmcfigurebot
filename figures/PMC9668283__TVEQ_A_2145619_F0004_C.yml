caption: Taxonomic, functional, and pathway analyses of differential metabolites.
  (A) Differential metabolite classification ring diagram based on matching results
  against the HMDB database. (B) Differential abundance scores (DA score) shows a
  trend of overall downregulation of metabolic pathways. C Network map of differential
  metabolite enriched pathways. Each point represents a pathway. The color represents
  the significant P value of enrichment. The redder the point represents, the more
  significant the enrichment of the pathway. The size of the circle represents the
  number of metabolites annotated to the pathway (count), and the larger the circle
  is, the higher the count. Network connections were noted between the pathways, indicating
  that they contain common differential metabolites; the thicker the line is, the
  more metabolites are shared by the two pathways.
