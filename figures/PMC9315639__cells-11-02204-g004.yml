caption: Functional enrichment of the gene cluster1 with the highest score of MCODE.
  (A) STRING reveals the interaction of genes in cluster 1. (B) Functional enrichment
  analyses of genes in cluster 1. (C) Network Analyst is used to validate the enrichment
  results and genes involved in extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction are
  noted in blue. The red nodes indicate protein digestion and absorption pathway and
  the violet nodes represent the genes involved in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction.
