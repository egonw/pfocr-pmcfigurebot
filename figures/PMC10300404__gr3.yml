  Local Manhattan plot, gene model, and local LD heatmap of the insulin-like gene
  region.(E) The haplotypes of the insulin-like gene in three lineages.(F) Hypothesized
  mechanism of diapause adaptation. The light-sensing input module (1) consists of
  CLOCK (CLK) and CYCLE (CYC) heterodimers, which drive the transcription of period
  (per), timeless (tim), and cryptochrome type 2 (cry2), whereby CRY2 is a negative
  regulator of CLK/CYC. CRY1 causes TIM degradation in a light-dependent manner to
  reset the phase of the clock. Through this upstream input module (labeled 1), light
  is detected, and the seasonally variable photoperiod is measured. Genes under positive
  selection in Xinjiang and those whose allelic variation was statistically associated
  with latitude are labeled in red. In the intermediate module (labeled 2), the circadian
  signaling pathway activates the release of hormones from the prothoracic gland (PG)
  because of stimulation of prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH). PTTH and PG are associated
  with secretion of Ecd. The resulting physiological changes (labeled 3) include pupation
  and decreases in transcription, cellular respiration, and metabolism, allowing the
  pupa to conserve energy reserves and synthesize compounds such as trehalose.
