caption: 'Overview of the functional distribution of KEGG in the intestinal microbiota
  of L. vannamei. Using the KEGG pathway database, which is a metabolic pathway database,
  biological metabolic pathways are classified into seven categories: Metabolism,
  Genetic Information Processing, Environmental Information Processing, Cellular Processes,
  Organismal Systems, Human Diseases, and Drug Development. The predicted functions
  in the major classes were ranked in order of relative abundance.'
