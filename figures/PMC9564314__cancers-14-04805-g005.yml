caption: The MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain (CD) functions as a node (NODE 1) in auto-induction
  of the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway. The 72 aa MUC1-C/CD includes a serine-rich
  motif (aa 50–59, SAGNGGSSLS; SRM) that interacts directly with the β-catenin Armadillo
  repeats []. This interaction contributes to stabilization of β-catenin and is regulated
  by upstream phosphorylation of (i) T-41 by PKCδ [], (ii) S-44 by GSK3β [], and (iii)
  Y-46 by EGFR and SRC [,]. The MUC1-C/CD CQC motif is necessary for interactions
  with certain proteins that are mediated by disulfide bonds []. In this way, the
  MUC1-C/CD CQC motif binds to the TCF4 E-tail [], facilitating the formation of β-catenin/TCF4
  complexes that activate CCND1 and MYC. MUC1-C forms auto-inductive circuits with
  β-catenin/TCF4 and MYC in sustaining activation of this node. Notably, the CQC motif
  Cys residues are subject to palmitoylation [], which could preclude their capacity
  to form disulfide bonds and function in this and other auto-inductive nodes.
