figure_title: Application of TEAPS for NF-κB signaling pathway model
caption: (A) The model structure of NF-κB signaling pathways. This signaling pathway
  includes feedback inhibition of NF-κB activation through IκBα and A20. (B) Time
  courses of NF-κB activation. The parameter set fitting to in vitro observation outputs
  a damped oscillation as is consistent with experimental observation (red), while
  the model outputs continuous oscillation when the parameter related to feedback
  inhibitions are changed (green). (C) The estimated basin stability for the reported
  parameter set (actual) and the parameter set outputting continuous oscillation (oscillation).
  (D) The estimated basin stability was increased by individual optimization process
  (gL-BFGS) when TEAPS were applied to the NF-κB model. (E) The distribution of parameter
  sets found by TEAPS for the NF-κB model. The found parameter values were broadly
  distributed (blue). For many parameters, the previously reported value (red) was
  included in the range found by TEAPS. (F, G) The distribution of the parameter values
  found by TEAPS in PC space. The reported values (red) were included in the found
  distribution for most axes, while the oscillative parameter set was outside of dominant
  distribution for later PCs. (F) The distributions for all PCs are shown. (G) The
  distributions of later PCs are enlarged.
