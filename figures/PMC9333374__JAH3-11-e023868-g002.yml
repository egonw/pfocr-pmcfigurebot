figure_title: Pathway impact and enrichment of the differentially regulated metabolites
  in the wild‐type (WT) and carnosine synthase transgenic (CarnsTg) hearts under basal
  and ischemic conditions
caption: A and B, Pathway impact analysis, and (C and D) pathway enrichment of the
  differentially regulated metabolites identified by N‐trimethylsilyl‐N‐methyl trifluroacetamide
  and N‐trimethylsilyl‐N‐methyl trifluoroacetamide derivatizations, respectively,
  between the WT and CarnsTg mice hearts under basal conditions. Pathway impact analysis
  after (E) 5 minutes and (F) 15 minutes of ischemia, and pathway enrichments of the
  differentially regulated metabolites (G) after 5 minutes and (H) 15 minutes of ischemia,
  between the WT and CarnsTg mice hearts (n=5–7 hearts per group). TCA indicates citric
  acid cycle.
