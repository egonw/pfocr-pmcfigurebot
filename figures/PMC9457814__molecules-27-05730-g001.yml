caption: A schematic depicting the development of prostate cancer. The stages of the
  cancer onset and progression are indicated by the molecular processes, genes, and
  signaling pathways which are important in different stages of cancer. The first
  sign of prostate cancer is an inflammation of the prostate gland as a result of
  uncontrollable cell division. This uncontrollable cell division is caused by mutations
  that arise due to damaged DNA. At a chromosomal level, the initiation of prostate
  cancer begins with the shortening of telomerase at the end of the chromosome. Oxidative
  stress from prostate gland inflammation can shorten prostatic telomeres []. Research
  on the Nkx3.1 homeobox gene has shown the impact of the gene on the prostate cancer
  initiation phase in mice. No tumor suppressor gene has been solely given a role
  in prostate cancer initiation or progression. However, several genes such as MYC,
  PTEN, NKX3.1., and TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusions are implicated in prostate cancer initiation.
  TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusions are responsible for the main molecular subtype of prostate
  cancer. The gene fusion activates the ERG oncogenic pathway, which contributes to
  the development of the disease. Metastasis of prostate cancer is conserved by the
  reactivation of pathways involved in cell division, which results in uncontrolled
  cell division and cell proliferation, leading to metastasis of the cancer []. Gene
  expression profiling results have indicated an overexpression in EZH2 mRNA and proteins
  present in metastatic prostate cancer. Due to the functions of EZH2 involving apoptosis
  and proliferation, EZH2 is a novel target for prostate cancer [].
