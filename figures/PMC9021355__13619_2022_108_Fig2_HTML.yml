caption: Scheme of the most common signaling pathways active in muscle during cancer
  cachexia. Several signaling pathways are activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines
  and tumuor-derived molecules. Protein degradation, through ubiquitin-proteosome
  pathways, can be activated by Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1)/AKT signaling,
  Tumor Necrosis alpha (TNFα)/ nuclear factor-KB (NF-KB) signaling, Interleukin1 (IL-1)/NF-KB
  signaling, Interleukin 6 (IL6)/ Janus kinase (JAK)- signal transducer and activator
  of transcription proteins (STAT) signaling. Other pathways involved in the activation
  of the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway are p38/ CCAAT Enhancer Binding Protein Beta
  (C/EBPβ) and SMAD2/3 signaling induced by TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK),
  Interferon gamma (INFγ) and transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ). These pathways
  all converge to activate the muscle specific ubiquitin ligase Atrogin1 and MURF1
  (muscle atrophy F-box protein (MAFBX) and muscle RING finger-containing protein
  1 (MURF1)) that ubiquitinate myofibrillar protein, inducing their degradation. The
  autophagy pathway can also be activated by STAT, SMAD2/3 p38 signaling pathways.
  Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), which normally stimulates protein synthesis
  via AKT and mTOR, is decreased during cachexia. These pathways are generally active
  in skeletal muscle. The activation of the TNFα/ NF-KB dependent ubiquitin–proteasome
  pathway is also active in cardiac muscle. Also, the autophagy pathway is activated
  in cardiac muscle
