caption: Expression analysis of target genes of identified five novel miRNAs in T1,
  T3, and T5 samples of Swarnaprabha (SW) and IR8 with respect to control. (A) Ribonucleoside-diphosphate
  reductase expression, a target of miRNA osa-novmiR1; (B) cytochrome P450 87A3, a
  target of miRNA osa-novmiR2; (C) GBSS1b, a target of miRNA osa-novmiR3; (D) NAC
  domain-containing protein, a target of miRNA osa-novmiR4; (E) FAD-dependent oxidoreductase,
  a target of miRNA osa-novmiR5; and (F) cryptochrome2 apoprotein, a target of miRNA
  osa-novmiR5. Each gene was amplified using gene-specific primers designed using
  Primer Blast. Actin was taken as an internal positive control. The primer sequences
  are provided in . Error bars are Â±SD of the average of three qRT-PCR replicates.
