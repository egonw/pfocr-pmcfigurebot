caption: PHF6 depends on HIF crosstalk to drive progression of Bca cells in vitro
  and in vivo. A Parental and HIF-DKO Bca cells (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, BT-549) expressing
  EV or PHF6 were subjected to conduct the CCK-8 assays. B Colony formation assays
  were conducted in Parental and HIF-DKO MCF-7 cells expressing EV or PHF6. Quantification
  data was shown on the right. C Cell migration assays were conducted in Parental
  and HIF-DKO MCF-7 cells expressing EV or PHF6. Quantification data was shown. D
  The subcutenous xenograft tumor model was conducted the compare the differential
  growth rates in tumors drived from shCtrl and shPHF6 cells. E Parental and HIF-DKO
  MDA-MB-231 cells expressing EV or PHF6 were orthotopically implanted into the mammary
  fat pad of female NOD/SCID mice, respectively. The corresponding tumor growth curves
  were generated. F The corresponding tumor weights from the indicated groups was
  compared. G Illustration of PHF6/BPTF/HIF regulatory mechanisms in driving HIF downstream
  targets. H, I The orthotopic implantation tumor model showing the AU1 responses
  of tumors derived from the parental and HIF-DKO MDA-MB-231 cells. Quantification
  of tumor volumes and weight were shown in (I) and (J). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001
