caption: 'TAK-3 mitigated the activation of inflammatory cells and neuroinflammation
  induced by LPS in acute TBI rats, with subsequent reversal of this effect observed
  on NF-κB signaling. (A) Immunoco-staining of Iba 1 and GFAP showed Iba 1 in red,
  GFAP in green, and DAPI in blue. (B-C) The immunofluorescence staining results demonstrated
  that treatment with a TAK-3 significantly suppressed the nuclear translocation and
  phosphorylation of NF-κB p65, which were subsequently restored upon administration
  of an NF-κB agonist. (D) The administration of a TAK-3 resulted in a significant
  reduction in TLR-4 receptor activity, while treatment with NF-κB led to a substantial
  decrease in TLR-4 receptor expression. Consequently, an increase was observed in
  the levels of the TLR-4 receptor. (All values are expressed as mean ±SD, n = 3/
  group, *** P < 0.001, ** P < 0.01, * P < 0.05 vs TBI group, ##P < 0.01, #P < 0.05
  vs LPS group, &&P < 0.01, &P < 0.05 vs TLR-4 group, scale = 20 μm).'
