figure_title: MALAT1/EZH2/GFER activates the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway
caption: After introduction of sh-MALAT1, oe-MALAT1, sh-EZH2, oe-EZH2, sh-GFER, and
  oe-GFER for 24 h, HL7702 cells were subjected to LPS treatment for 16 h. Phosphorylated
  AMPK and mTOR were assayed by western blotting (Aâ€“C), *p<0.05, **p<0.01 vs. the
  LPS + oe-NC or LPS + sh-NC group. HL7702 cells were transfected with oe-MALAT1 or
  oe-NC for 24 h and then stimulated with the AMPK inhibitor Compound C for 1 h, and
  treated with LPS. Phosphorylated AMPK and mTOR levels were determined by Western
  blotting (D, F); ALT (G), AST (H) and LDH (I); Cell proliferation was determined
  by CCK-8 assays (J) and EdU staining (K); Cell apoptosis was assayed by TUNEL staining
  (L), Determination of MDA (M), GSH (N), and SOD (O) in cells. *p<0.05 vs. LPS +
  oe-NC or LPS + oe-MALAT1 group. n=3. AST, aspartic transaminase; ALT, alanine aminotransferase;
  GSH, glutathione; LDH, lactic dehydrogenase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MDA, malondialdehyde;
  NC, negative control; SOD, superoxide dismutase.
