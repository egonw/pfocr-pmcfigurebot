caption: 'Sciatic nerve conduction velocity. The nerve conduction velocity of the
  DNP group was significantly lower than that of normal rats; however, there were
  no differences among the DNP, P2X7 shRNA, and NC groups. Intrathecal injection of
  P2X7 shRNA and p38 inhibitors decreased the rate of nerve injury. Data are shown
  as mean ± SEM based on at least three independent experiments, n = 6; ** p < 0.01
  versus the Control group; ## p < 0.01 versus the DNP group.'
