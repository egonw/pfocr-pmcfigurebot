figure_title: Both cGAS and STING are required for tonic IFN signaling in Gcc2-KO
  cells
caption: a, b Western Blot (a) and qRT-PCR (b) analysis of tonic IFN signaling in
  Gcc2WT, Gcc2KO, Gcc2KOSTINGKO, and Gcc2KOcGASKO MEFs. Two independent CRISPR/Cas9
  knockout clones of each genotype are included. p-Sting, p-Tbk1, and p-Stat1 are
  key phosphorylation events of the STING signaling pathway (a). Expression of IFN
  genes and ISGs are shown in a heatmap (b, left) and representative bar graphs (b,
  right). n = 3. c, d Western Blot (c) and qRT-PCR (d) analysis of tonic IFN signaling
  in Gcc2WT, Gcc2KO, Gcc2KOcGASKO MEFs reconstituted with vector control, wild-type
  cGAS, E225A/D227A cGAS (enzymatic-dead mutant), K407A/K411A cGAS (DNA-binding mutant).
  Cells were analyzed as in a, b. n = 3. e, f Western Blot (e) and qRT-PCR (f) analysis
  of tonic IFN signaling in Gcc2WT, Gcc2KO, Gcc2KOSTINGKO MEFs reconstituted with
  vector control, wild-type STING, R238A/Y240A STING (ligand-binding mutant), S366A
  STING (IFN signaling mutant). Cells were analyzed as in a, b. n = 3. g, h qPCR analysis
  of mtDNA content (g) and qRT-PCR analysis of tonic IFN signaling (h) in two independent
  clones of Gcc2WT, Gcc2KO with or without mtDNA depletion by EtBr. n = 3. i Intracellular
  cGAMP level in Gcc2WT and Gcc2KO cells mock treated or stimulated with HT-DNA. n = 8.
  j qPCR analysis of indicated cytoplasmic DNA species in Gcc2WT and Gcc2KO cells.
  n = 5. Data are representative of at least three independent experiments. Data (b,
  d, f, and g–j) are shown as mean ± s.e.m. P values were determined by one-way ANOVA
  (b, d, f, and g–j).
