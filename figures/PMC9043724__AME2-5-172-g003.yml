caption: Trdmt1 deletion leads to impaired inflammatory factor response after LPS
  treatment. A‐C, The relative expression of TNF‐α in lung (A), liver (B), and spleen
  (C) of 1 mg/kg LPS‐treated Trdmt1 knockout rats. D, The TNF‐α protein level in serum
  of 1 mg/kg LPS‐treated Trdmt1 knockout rats. E‐H, Alveolar macrophage and peritoneal
  macrophage derived from Trdmt1 knockout rats were cultured and treated with 100 ng/mL
  LPS. The relative expression of TNF‐α of peritoneal macrophage (F), and alveolar
  macrophage (G) was determined. WT, wild‐type rats; KO, Trdmt1 knockout rats. Mean ± SEM;
  *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001
article_title: TRDMT1 exhibited protective effects against LPS‐induced inflammation
  in rats through TLR4‐NF‐κB/MAPK‐TNF‐α pathway.
