caption: 'Effects of electroacupuncture on the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway in Thy1-αSyn
  transgenic mice. (a) cAMP concentrations. (b) mRNA expression of PKA. (c) Protein
  expression of PKA in mouse colon tissue of the normal control (N), PD model (M),
  electroacupuncture (EA), and western medicine (WM) groups. ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01
  relative to the normal control group; #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01 relative to the PD
  model group.'
