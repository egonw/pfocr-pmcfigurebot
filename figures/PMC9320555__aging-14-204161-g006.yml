caption: Effects of curcumin and BDDD-721 against medulloblastoma cells in vivo. (A)
  The tumor volume of xenografts was recorded after curcumin and BDDD-721 treatment.
  (B) The difference of the final median tumor volume between curcumin and BDDD-721
  treatment was analyzed by SPSS statistical software. (C) T/C (%) was calculated
  and analyzed after curcumin and BDDD-721 treatment. (D) The difference of the final
  weight of transplanted tumor between curcumin and BDDD-721 treatment was analyzed
  by SPSS statistical software. (E) TGI(%) was calculated and analyzed after curcumin
  and BDDD-721 treatment. Then, the expression of Ki67 and PCNA proteins were detected
  by western blot in DAOY (F) and ONS-76 (G) xenografts. (H) Shh protein was detected
  by western blot in DAOY and ONS-76 xenografts. And the expression of Smo, GLI1 and
  Ptch1 proteins were detected by western blot in DAOY (I) and ONS-76 (J) xenografts.
