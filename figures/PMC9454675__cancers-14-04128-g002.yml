caption: 'Identification of recurrence-specific differentially expressed genes. RNA-seq
  and microRNA-seq analysis of 467 tissue specimens of PTC patients in The Cancer
  Genome Atlas (TCGA) database integrated with clinical data, pathological data, molecular
  landscape, and survival information. By comparing the transcriptome signature of
  46 recurrent and 441 disease-free patients, we identified a panel of eight deregulated
  microRNAs and 16 deregulated mRNAs associated with disease recurrence and/or progression.
  (A) Volcano plot and table showing differentially expressed microRNAs in recurrent
  cohorts compared with the non-recurrence group. The significance threshold was set
  at a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 and a |log2 fold change (logFC)| > 1.0. Three
  upregulated genes in red and five downregulated genes in blue are shown. (B) Volcano
  plot and table showing differentially expressed mRNAs/lncRNAs in recurrent cohorts
  compared with the non-recurrence group. Four upregulated genes in red and 12 downregulated
  genes in blue are shown. (C) Co-expression analysis of genes and miRNAs. Spearmanâ€™s
  correlation analysis was performed. In the correlation matrix, red color shows a
  positive correlation and blue shows a negative correlation. (D) Functional enrichment
  analysis of DEGs. (E) Pathway enrichment analysis of DEmiRs using Diana lab tools.
