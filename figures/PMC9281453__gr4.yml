caption: SPΔCDelta-PVLPs stimulated NF-κB and Ap1-signal pathway in THP1 cells and
  THP1-derived macrophages(A) The schematic diagram of NF-κB activity luciferase reporter
  assay. The THP1-NF-κB -Luc or THP1-AP1-Luc sensor cell line was incubated with SPΔCwt,
  -SPΔCG614, or -SPΔCDelta-PVLPs for 6 h, and the activation of NF-κB or AP1 signaling
  was detected by measurement of the luciferase activity.(B) WB detected the incorporation
  of SPΔCwt, -SPΔCG614, or -SPΔCDelta in PVLPs using SARS-CoV-2 S-NTD antibody. The
  GagP24 was detected using mouse anti-P24 antibody.(C and D) The THP1-NFκB-Luc or
  THP1-NFκB-Luc-derived macrophages, and THP1-AP-1-Luc cells or THP1-AP-1-Luc-derived
  macrophages were treated with equal amounts of SPΔCwt, SPΔCG614, or SPΔCDelta-PVLPs
  (adjusted by P24) for 6 h, and the activation of NF-κB or AP-1 signaling was detected
  by measurement of the Luc activity. Meanwhile, Gag-VLPs or TNF-α treatment were
  used as negative or positive control.The results are the mean values ± standard
  deviations (SD) of two independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined
  using unpaired t test, and significant p values are represented with asterisks (∗p
  ≤ 0.05; ∗∗p ≤ 0.01; ∗∗∗p ≤ 0.001; ∗∗∗∗p ≤ 0.0001). No significant (ns) was not shown.
