caption: Cordycepin reduced MA-10 growth ability in time- and dose-dependent manners.
  MA-10 cells were treated with 10, 25, 50, 100 and 200 Î¼M cordycepin for 24 hr (A),
  and for 48 hr (B), respectively. Cell viabilities were examined by MTT viability
  test. Results were presented as percentages of cell growth of each group relative
  to control group. *P<0.05, and ***P<0.001 indicate significant statistical difference
  compared to the control group.

  cycle arrest, caspase pathway and ER stress in MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells.
