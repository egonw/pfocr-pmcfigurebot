caption: Tumor promoting property by UPK3A is mediated by p53 signaling pathway. (a)
  The pathways in which UPK3A involved were analyzed on Enriched KEGG pathway analysis.
  (b, c) The expression of p-p53, KLF4, ZMAT3, MDM2, and SP1 in SNU-216 and HGC-27
  cells were detected using qRT-PCR and Western blot assay. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. Mock group
  and si-NC group.
