caption: 'Survival analysis of PLCE1 gene expression. (A) The upper figure represents
  the risk scoring curve; the middle figure represents the distribution of the survival
  time and survival status corresponding to the PLCE1 expression; the lower figure
  represents the PLCE1 expression heat map. The X-axis labels are the same for all
  panels, and the X-axis represents samples ordered by z-score of PLCE1 expression.
  (B) Kaplanâ€“Meier survival analysis of PLCE1 gene (p=0.028). (C) Time-dependent ROC
  analysis of PLCE1 gene. PLCE1: Phospholipase C epsilon 1.'
article_title: PLCE1 is a poor prognostic marker and may promote immune escape from
