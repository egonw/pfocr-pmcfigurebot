caption: 'HIT000218960 inhibits 5-FU induced apoptosis by promoting HMGA2 expression.
  (A) HMGA2 protein expression is higher in gastric cancer tissues compared with that
  in normal gastric tissues. Representative western blotting images of (A) are presented
  on the right. ***P<0.001 vs. normal. (B) HIT000218960 expression was positively
  correlated with that of HMGA2 in gastric cancer tissues. (C) Western blotting was
  used to detect the expression of HMGA2 protein in SNU-5 and NCI-N87 cells following
  transfection and representative protein bands are presented on the right. ***P<0.001
  vs. Si-NC and ###P<0.001 vs. LV-NC. (D) HMGA2 knockdown promoted 5-FU-induced apoptosis
  in SNU-5 and NCI-N87 cells. (E) Representative flow cytometry images of (D) ***P<0.001
  vs. Si-NC group. (F) The inhibitive effects of HIT000218960 overexpression on 5-FU-induced
  apoptosis was partially abolished by the HMGA2 knockdown in SNU-5 cells. Experiments
  were repeated in triplicate. ***P<0.001 vs. the WT. ###P<0.001 vs. LV-HIT000218960.
  HMGA2, high mobility group A2; 5-FU, 5-fluorouracil; WT, wild-type, cell lines did
  not receive any transfection; LV, lentivirus; si, small interfering; PI, propidium
  iodide.'
