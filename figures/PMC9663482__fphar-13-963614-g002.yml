caption: Effect of Quercetin on spontaneous movement of glioblastoma cells using high
  content analysis. U87MG and CHG-5 cell lines were incubated with various concentrations
  of Quercetin (0, 20, 40, 80 μM) for 12 h in serum free medium. Digital phase contrast
  (DPC) images are taken every 1 h on PerkinElmer Operetta for 12 h. Mean square displacement
  (A,B), accumulated distance (C–F), displacement (D–G) and average speed (E–H) accumulated
  over time for all cells were quantified and presented. Harmony 4.9 software was
  used to track cell displacement, and representative cell tracking images (I,J) were
  given. All data are shown as the mean ± SD of three experiments. *p＜0.05, **p＜0.01
  or ***p＜0.001 vs. control group.
