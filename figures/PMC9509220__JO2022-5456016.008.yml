caption: PDLIM1 overexpression weakens the procancer function of miR-187 in GC cells.
  AGS cells, already transfected with miR-187 mimics, were transfected with PDLIM1
  overexpression plasmid. (a) RT-qPCR confirmed miR-187 expression. (b-c) CCK8 and
  BrdU staining measured cell proliferation. (d) Transwell monitored AGS cell migration
  and invasion. (e) Flow cytometry evaluated cell apoptosis. (f) Western blot determined
  the protein profiles of Bax, Bad, and Bcl2. (g) RT-qPCR verified the mRNA levels
  of YAP, AREG, Myc, and CCDN2. (h) Western blot tested the levels of AREG, Myc, and
  CCND2 as well as those of YAP and phosphorylated YAP in the nucleus. ∗∗P < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001 (vs. the miR-NC group). &P < 0.05, &&P < 0.05, &&&P < 0.001 (vs. the
  miR-187 group). N = 3.
