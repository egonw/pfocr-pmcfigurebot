caption: 'Methane protects mice from OVA-induced lung inflammation as assessed by
  EOS, IgE, and protein and mRNA expression of asthma-related cytokines. The representative
  flow cytometry plot indicates the EOS cell percentage in BALF (a) and these data
  were visualized (b). IBALF IgE (c) and IL-4 (d) levels, as well as serum IL-5 and
  IL-10 concentrations, were measured and analyzed by ELISA (e). In the transcriptional
  analysis, mRNA levels of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 in the lungs were evaluated and analyzed
  by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (f). The data are presented in the form
  of the mean ± SEM (n = 6 per group). ∗ and ∗∗ denote P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively,
  versus control group; ## denote P < 0.01, respectively, versus asthma group.'
