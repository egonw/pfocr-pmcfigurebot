caption: Dominance of JAK-STAT or PI3K-AKT pathway in pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic
  leukemia. T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patient samples were defined
  as IL-7 and/or BEZ-235 responders based on phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of
  particular targets as described in  and . TALL-2 did not respond to any of those
  2 ex vivo treatment, TALL-5 and TALL-13 were defined as dual responders to IL-7
  and BEZ-235 ex vivo treatment. TALL-1, TALL-3, TALL-4 and TALL-11 are IL-7 responders
  (and BEZ-235 non-responders). TALL-6, TALL-8, TALL-9, TALL-10, TALL-12, TALL-14,
  TALL-15, TALL-16 and TALL-17 are BEZ-235 responders (and IL-7 non-responders). Thirteen
  of 16 of T-ALL patients’ samples show mutual exclusivity of response. (B) Count
  of TALL cells/mm at day 8 (d8) in IL-7 responder (red circles, n=4), dual responder
  to IL-7 and BEZ-235 (purple hexagons, n=2), BEZ-235 responder (blue squares, n=9)
  and non-responder (grey cross, n=1) TALL samples are shown. Horizontal dashed line
  dissects prednisone (PDN) good responders (under the cut-off) and PDN poor responders
  (above the cut-off).
article_title: Either IL-7 activation of JAK-STAT or BEZ inhibition of PI3K-AKT-mTOR
  pathways dominates the single-cell phosphosignature of ex vivo treated pediatric
  T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells.
