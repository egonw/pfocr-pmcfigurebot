caption: 'Effect of Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) on the proliferation and migration
  of atrial fibroblasts. (A) The cell counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays showed that TMAO
  (co-cultured for 24 and 48 h) proliferated the atrial fibroblasts; (B) cell migration
  assessed by Transwell assays after 24 h of TMAO treatment and the statistical analysis;
  n=3. The values are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. *P<0.05, compared
  to the control group; #P<0.05, compared to the TMAO 100 µM group. The scale in the
  figure is 200 µm.'
article_title: The transformation of atrial fibroblasts into myofibroblasts is promoted
  by trimethylamine N-oxide via the Wnt3a/β-catenin signaling pathway.
