caption: Macrophages are enriched in meningioma tissue, and coculture with meningioma
  cells promotes M2 polarization of macrophages. (a) Immunohistochemical staining
  was used to detect the distribution of macrophages and the expression levels of
  polarization markers in meningiomas and meningeal tissues. Scale bar 50 μm. (b)
  Detection of mRNA expression levels of CD163, CD206, ARG1, IL-10, CD86, and TNF-α
  in macrophages by qPCR. (c) After coculture with tumor cells, the protein expression
  levels of CD163, CD206, and ARG1 in macrophages were detected by western blotting.
  (d) ELISA assay was used to detect the content of IL-10 secreted by macrophages
  in culture supernatant. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, vs. the control group.
