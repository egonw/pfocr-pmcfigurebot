caption: Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) triggers the expression of inflammatory
  and immunological mediators in human endometrial epithelial cells, as detected by
  quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). mRNA expression levels of (A)
  proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ; (B) proinflammatory chemokines
  IL-8, MCP-1, and RANTES; (C) cell adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and CD44; (D)
  COX-2, MMP-2, and MMP-9. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used
  as the housekeeping gene. All data are expressed as relative values against their
  respective control group. Data represent the means ± standard deviation of three
  independent experiments. * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01(vs. control).
