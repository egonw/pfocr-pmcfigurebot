caption: Effect of AWGP and KCWGP on the pathways of AMPK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR in C2C12
  myotubes. C2C12 myotubes were treated with AWGP or KCWGP (0.1, 1 and 2 mg/ml) or
  with metformin (2.5 mM) for 45 min. Phosphorylation of (A) AMPK, (B) Akt and (C)
  mTOR and (B) the expression of PI3K were analyzed by western blotting. The density
  of each target was calculated with the expression of β-actin. The values from the
  triplicate of experiments are given as the mean ± standard error of mean. *P<0.05,
  **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs. untreated cells (N). AWGP, American wild ginseng pharmacopuncture;
  KCWGP, Korean cultivated wild ginseng pharmacopuncture; and M, metformin-treated
  cells; N, untreated cells.

  pharmacopuncture extracts on the regulation of C2C12 myoblasts differentiation through
  AMPK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.
