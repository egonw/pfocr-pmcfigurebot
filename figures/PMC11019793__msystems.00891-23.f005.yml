caption: The metabolomic analysis of MbovP0725 activity in M. bovis. (A and B) PCA
  score chart for all samples in pos (A) and neg (B) modes. The abscissa is PC1, and
  the PCA score graph shows 95% confidence intervals. Each dot represents a sample,
  and different groups are labeled with different colors. Six replicates were included
  for both HB0801 and T8.66. (C and D) Bubble plots for metabolic pathway enrichment
  analysis in positive (C) and negative (D) modes. The x-axis enrichment factor (RichFactor)
  is the number of differential metabolites annotated to the pathway divided by all
  identified metabolites annotated to the pathway. The larger the value, the greater
  the proportion of differential metabolites annotated to the pathway. The dot size
  represents the number of DAMs annotated to this pathway. (E) Volcano map of DAMs
  in both positive and negative modes. The log2 of fold change plotted against the
  âˆ’log10 of the P-value. The two vertical dotted lines in the figure are the two fold
  change threshold, and the horizontal dotted line is the P-value at a 0.05 threshold.
  Red and green dots represent up- and downregulated DAMs, respectively, and gray
  dots represent non-significant metabolites. A variable with a VIP score close to
  or greater than 1 was considered important in the model. VIP, variable importance
  in projection. (F) Bubble chart of KEGG pathways involving significantly enriched
  DAMs in both pos and neg modes.
