caption: Knockdown of GGCT and MRPL9 inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in vivo.
  (A,B) The Xenogen IVIS Lumina System detects the bioluminescence intensity of subcutaneous
  xenografts in nude mice in vivo, and performs statistical analysis on the fluorescence
  signals (n = 3). (C) Subcutaneous xenografts in nude mice. (D,E) Statistical analysis
  of mass and volume of subcutaneous xenografts (n = 3). (F) The Xenogen IVIS Lumina
  System detects bioluminescence intensity in the lungs of nude mice in vivo (top)
  and ex vivo (bottom) (n = 3). (G) The line chart denotes luciferase bioluminescence
  emitted from the lungs in each group over time (0–28 days). (H) Statistical analysis
  of bioluminescence intensity in the lungs of nude mice in vivo (n = 3). (I) Statistical
  analysis results of bioluminescence intensity of nude mouse lung tissue in vitro
  (n = 3). (J) HE staining was used to analyze the metastases in the lungs of nude
  mice. Measurement data (mean ± standard deviation) between two groups were compared
  by paired t test, and multiple groups were compared by one-way analysis of variance
  (ANOVA). “**” represents p ≤ 0.01, “*” represents p ≤ 0.05.
