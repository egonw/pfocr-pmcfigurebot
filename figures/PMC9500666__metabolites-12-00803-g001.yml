caption: NEFA induced ER stress in bovine mammary epithelial cells. (A,B) Relative
  mRNA expression of GRP78 and HSP70 in BMECs after treatment with various concentrations
  (0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 mM) of NEFA for 3, 6, 9, and 12 h. (C) Protein expression of
  GRP78 and HSP70 in BMECs stimulated with the different concentrations of NEFA for
  6 h. (D) TEM images of BMECs in the absence and presence of 0.9 mM NEFA for 6 h;
  green arrowheads represent ER expansion. Data are presented as the means Â± the standard
  errors of the mean (SEM) of three independent experiments. n.s. means not significant,
  * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01.
