caption: 'Significantly enriched biological pathway analysis: (A) Top 10 significantly
  functional enriched biological pathway terms of 241 DEGs associated with hypoxia-GBM.
  (B) Top 10 significantly functional enriched biological pathway terms of 32 hub
  signatures associated with hypoxia-GBM. (C) Top six enriched pathways of four molecular
  signatures (LYN, MMP9, PSMB9, and TIMP1) linked with the GBM microenvironment. Functional
  and signaling pathway enrichments were conducted using the KEGG pathway (http://www.genome.jp/kegg)
  and FunRich tool.'
