caption: Glutamine promotes pancreatic cancer progression. A–C The proliferation of
  SW1990 (A), BxPC-3 (B), and SU.8686 (C) cells cultured in 2 mM glutamine containing
  media were compared with cells cultured in glutamine-free media using Cell Counting
  Kit-8. D–F Colony formation ability of SW1990 (D), BxPC-3 (E), and SU.8686 (F) cells
  cultured in 2 mM glutamine containing media were compared with cells cultured in
  glutamine-free media. Quantification (above) and representative images (below) are
  shown. G, H Tumor growth (G) and weight (H) of SW1990 cells treated with or without
  Don in BALB/c nude mice. Tumor growth was measured at the indicated time points
  and dissected at the endpoint. n = 6 mice per group. I, J Tumor growth (I) and weight
  (J) of BxPC-3 cells treated with or without Don in BALB/c nude mice. n = 8 mice
  per group. K, L Lymphatic metastatic rate of BxPC-3 footpad mouse models treated
  with (37.5%) or without Don (100.0%) in BALB/c nude mice. n = 9 mice per group.
  M, N Peritoneal seeding of BxPC-3 intraperitoneal mouse models treated with or without
  Don in BALB/c nude mice. n = 9 mice per group. Don, diazooxonorleucine. Scale bars,
  50 μm. Data represent the mean ± s.e.m., *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001
