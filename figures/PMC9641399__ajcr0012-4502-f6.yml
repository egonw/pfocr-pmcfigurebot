caption: 'IVM inhibited the integrin β1/FAK and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways in
  HCT-8 cells. (A) The activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway and the expression of the
  EMT-related proteins and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) in HCT-8 cells treated
  with 6 μM IVM and/or 25 nM vincristine (VCR) for 48 h were determined by Western
  blotting analysis using GAPDH as internal control. Histone H3 and β-tubulin were
  used as the nuclear and cytoplasmic fraction marker, respectively. Cells treated
  with vehicle served as the control. (B-E) The activation of integrin β1/FAK pathway
  and the activities of p-Paxillin, RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 in HCT-8 cells (B and C)
  and HCT-116 cells (D and E) treated with IVM and/or VCR for 48 h (B and D) or 20
  min (C and E) were determined by Western blotting analysis (B and D) and pull-down
  assay (C and E), respectively. Abbreviations: Lysate, whole cell lysate; Nuc, nuclear
  lysate; Cyt, cytosolic lysate. The blots shown were representative of two independent
  experiments.'
