figure_title: GSEA enrichment analysis
caption: (A–D) Based on NES values, the top five enriched pathways in the MUT group
  were shown. (E–J) Based on NES values, the top five enriched pathways in the WT
  group were shown. NES value represents the enrichment score after normalization.
  The higher the NES value, the more genes were enriched in the pathway.
