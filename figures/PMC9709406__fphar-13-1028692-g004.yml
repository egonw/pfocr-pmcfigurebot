caption: Regulation of cancer cells proliferation due to the binding of 3l with wild-type
  EGFR. (A) Binding sensorgrams for 3l interaction with immobilized wild-type of EGFR.
  The K D(M) value between 3l and wild-type EGFR is 8.23 × 10–6(B) Binding sensorgrams
  for icotinib interaction with immobilized wild-type of EGFR. The K D(M) value between
  icotinib and wild-type EGFR is 3.60 × 10–5(C) The influence of icotinib and 3l on
  the EGFR-RAS-Raf-MAPK pathway in KYSE450 and KYSE450TR cells.
