figure_title: ERK inhibitors combined with EZH2 inhibitors increased Utrn expression
  in adult myoblasts
caption: 'a Schematic of the ERK signalling pathway and the inhibitors used in this
  study. b Bioluminescence image (left) and quantification of flux (right) of U22
  A5 myoblasts after 24 h treatment with EZH2i GSK503 (grey triangles) or ERKi LY32
  (red open circles) alone or in combination (black closed circles). LY32 treatment
  caused a dose-dependent increase in flux which was further amplified by the addition
  of GSK503 (shaded area). c As in b, for U22 A5 myoblasts treated with EZH2i GSK503
  (grey triangles) and ERKi Ravox (red open circles) either alone or combined (black
  closed circles). A dose dependent increase in flux was observed after Ravox treatment
  and this was increased upon the addition of GSK503 (shaded area). d RT-qPCR of U22
  A5 myoblasts after 24 h treatment with GSK503 and ERK pathway inhibitors (at 10 µM),
  applied either alone or combined; increased Utrn mRNA upon treatment with ERK pathway
  inhibitors was amplified by the addition of GSK503. One-way ANOVAs (in order: p = 0.0012,
  p = 0.0047, p = 0.0036, p = 0.0015) with Sidak’s multiple comparisons test was used
  to compare between groups. e, f Dmd-deficient U22 A5 myoblast lines 2a6 and 3b2
  were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 (details in Fig. ). UtrnR bioluminescence (blue
  green) after treatment with GSK503 or LY32 (10 µM) alone or in combination is shown
  in e and RT-qPCR analysis of Utrn mRNA expression is shown in f. For each clone,
  comparisons between treatment groups were performed with one-way ANOVAs (e, p = 0.0009
  both, f p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0023) with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test. Expression
  levels were normalised to 18 S and Tbp and shown relative to the vehicle treated
  control (d, f). Bars show mean + /− SEM with adjusted p values: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001) (d–f).'
