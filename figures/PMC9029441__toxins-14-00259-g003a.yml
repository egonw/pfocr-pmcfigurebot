caption: 'Effects of CTN on oxidative damage in the liver of mice. After all the liver
  tissues were processed, oxidation and antioxidant-related indicators show CAT (A),
  SOD (B), GSH (C), T-AOC (D), MDA (E), and NO (F). (G). ROS content in liver tissue
  was detected by fluorescence microscope (Figure scale bar: 100 μm). The above data
  are expressed as mean ± SEM. Compared with the control group, ** p < 0.01.'
