caption: 'Effects of rhein on renal function in CGN rats. (a–d) Biochemical detection
  of 24 h urinary protein (a), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (b), serum creatinine (SCr)
  (c), and albumin (ALB) (d) in each group of rats. (e) Results of renal index of
  rats in each group (n = 6). (f) H&E staining was applied to observe the renal injury
  of rats in each group. Black arrows expressed inflammatory cell infiltrates; yellow
  arrow displayed tubular epithelial cell detachment; blue arrow indicated glomerular
  congestion; and green arrows suggested renal interstitial congestion. ∗∗p < 0.01,
  control group; ##p < 0.01, CGN group.'
