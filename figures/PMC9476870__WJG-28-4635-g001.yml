caption: 'Network construction. A: Venn diagram of the candidate targets in Yinchenhao
  decoction (YCHD) and obstructive jaundice (OJ); B: The Component-Target network.
  The blue circles refer to 123 putative targets of YCHD for the treatment of OJ.
  The red and purple diamonds represent YCHD and OJ, respectively. The green oval
  represents the chemical composition. The blue rectangle represents the target protein.
  The degree indicates the number of routes connected to this node in the network;
  C: The proteinâ€“protein interaction network. The size of the set node is proportional
  to the degree, and the larger the degree, the redder the color, indicating that
  the target interaction is higher. The key targets are protein kinase B, tumor protein
  53, interleukin 6, vascular endothelial growth factor A, and caspase-3. They are
  the core targets of YCHD in treating OJ; D: The Gene Ontology enrichment analysis
  of involved biological processes; E: The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomics
  pathway enrichment analysis of putative targets; F: Component-target-signaling pathway
  network. The red hexagon represents the signaling pathway; the yellow hexagon represents
  the component; and the blue circle represents the target.'
