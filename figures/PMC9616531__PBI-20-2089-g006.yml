  (a) The mid‐vein cross section of the 1st leaf. Bar = 200 μm. (b) The leaf lamina
  cross section of the 1st leaf. VB, vascular bundle. (c) The mid‐vein cross section
  of the 3rd leaf. (d) The leaf lamina cross section of the 3rd leaf. (e) The lower
  epidermis of 3rd leaf. Bar = 500 μm. (f) The upper epidermis of 3rd leaf. (g) Contents
  of main catechins, caffeine and theanine in the 1st and 3rd leaf. (h) Autofluorescent
  images of the lamina and mid‐vein section of 1st leaf and 3rd leaf. Abbreviation:
  EM, emission light wavelength; EX, excitation light wavelength LE, lower epidermis;
  NGT, non‐glandular trichome; PH，phloem; PM, palisade mesophyll; SM, spongy mesophyll;
