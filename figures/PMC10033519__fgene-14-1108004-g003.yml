caption: Analysis of CHAF1Aâ€™s functional roles and potential mechanisms. (A) The KEGG
  annotation of CHAF1A co-expression gene network was indicated by OmicShare. The
  length of the bar stands for the number of genes enriched in each function. (B)
  The top 20 pathways of CHAF1A co-expression gene network were generated by using
  OmicShare. The size of node stands for the exact number of genes that enriched in
  pathway, and the colour stands for p-value. (C) The enrichment of cancer hallmarks
  based on the CHAF1A co-expression gene network using GSEA.
article_title: Overexpression of CHAF1A is associated with poor prognosis, tumor immunosuppressive
  microenvironment and treatment resistance.
