caption: VEGF-A signaling through the Shc/MAP kinase pathway in primary endothelial
  cells. (A) Endothelial cells were isolated from the hearts of 2-month-old mice (n
  ≥ 5/genotype) and treated with (+) or without (–) VEGF-A (40 ng/mL) for 5 min. (i)
  Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation (Ip) with α-Shc antibody followed
  by immunoprobing with antibodies against Shc, phospho-CEACAM1 (pCC1), and phospho-VEGFR2
  (pVEGFR2) to evaluate the level of these proteins in the α-Shc immunopellet. (ii–iii)
  Lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with α-phospho-antibodies against phosphorylated
  MAPK and NF-κB and in parallel gels, against MAP Kinase (MAPK), and NF-κB protein
  for normalization. (iv) Endothelin-1 (ET-1) was assayed in the media of isolated
  endothelial cells stimulated with VEGF-A for 20 min. Values were expressed as mean
  ± SEM. * p < 0.05 vs. no VEGF-A (solid bars)/same genotype; †p < 0.05 vs. (–) VEGF-A
  in all 3 controls; §p < 0.05 (+) VEGF-A (vertical lines) in all 3 controls. (B)
  Retro-orbital venous blood was drawn from overnight fasted mice fed HC for 3 months
  (n ≥ 5/genotype) to analyze plasma (i) ET-1, (ii) PGE2, and (iii) PDGF-B. Values
  were expressed as mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05 vs. Ldlr−/−VECad–Cc1+/+ (a, white bar);
  †p < 0.05 vs. Ldlr−/−VECad+Cc1+/+ (b, grey bar); and §p < 0.05 vs. Ldlr−/−VECad–Cc1fl/fl
  (c, teal bar).
