caption: 'PD3 treatment reduced the expression of proteins associated with the MAPK/NF-κB
  signaling pathway. (a) Bands of NF-κBp65 and p-NF-κBp65, p38 and p-p38, ERK1/2 and
  p-ERK1/2, and JNK1/2 and p-JNK1/2 proteins. PD3 treatment reduced the expression
  levels of NF-κBp65 and p-NF-κBp65 (b), p38 and p-p38 (c), ERK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 (d),
  and JNK1/2 and p-JNK1/2 (e) proteins. PD3, platycodin D3. Data were expressed as
  mean ± SD, n = 3. Compared with the control group, ★P < 0.05, ★★P < 0.01; compared
  with the asthma group, #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01.'
