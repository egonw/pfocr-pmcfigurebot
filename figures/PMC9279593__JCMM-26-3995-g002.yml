caption: 'Celecoxib suppresses an AKT‐driven lipogenic pathway in livers of AKT mice.
  Western blotting was performed to analyze the Akt/mTORC1 signaling (A) and lipogenic
  transcriptional proteins (C) in liver tissues from the WT cohort and the AKT mice
  intragastrically administered either vehicle or celecoxib. Histograms in (B) and
  (D) represent the expression of key components in the Akt/mTORC1 signaling and its
  downstream lipogenic pathway quantified through the western blotting optical analysis
  shown in (A) and (C), respectively. β‐actin was used as an internal reference. Immunoreactive
  bands (including those with white backgrounds) were visualized in a gel documentation
  system (G: BOX Chemi XRQ, Syngene) without further modification. Quantified data
  are presented as mean ± S.D., n = 5. #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001 versus
  the WT group; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 versus the AKT group. (E) Immunohistochemical
  staining (yellow‐brown localized in the cytoplasm) of FASN and ACC in the liver
  of wild‐type (WT) mice or the AKT mice in the absence or presence of celecoxib.
  Original magnification: 100×; scale bar: 100 μm. Abbreviations: CELE, celecoxib;
  t, total; p, phosphorylated. CELE‐L and CELE‐H represent intragastric administration
  of celecoxib at low (50 mg/kg) and high (100 mg/kg) doses, respectively'
