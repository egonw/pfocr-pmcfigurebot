figure_title: Schematic representation of effect of vitamin D3 on EPCs and/or endothelial
  cells. Binding of vitamin D to nuclear VDR in combination with RXR on VDRE triggers
  the expression of number of genes, such as eNOS, VEGF, CuZn dismutase, and pro-autophagic
  bacilin-1. Vitamin D3 mediates activation of eNOS by phosphorylation resulting in
  the augmentation of NO synthesis. Intracellular Ca2+ influx is caused by vitamin
  D and subsequent calcium calmodulin complex stabilizes the catalytic state of eNOS
  which catalyzes the synthesis of NO from L-Arginine and molecular oxygen. In association
  with VEGF, SDF-1 and MMP-9, NO leads to the migration of EPC from the permissive
  vascular zone of bone marrow into the circulation. The upregulation of CuZn dismutase
  by vitamin D3 via VDR activation attenuates the cellular oxidative stress, while
  upregulation of pro-autophagic bacilin-1 by VDR mediated vitamin D3 reduces the
  cellular apoptosis. Increased VEGF mRNA expression and protein synthesis mediates
  EPC migration, proliferation, and in vitro angiogenesis. Upregulation of microRNA
  (miR-659, miR-510) and downregulation of microRNA (miR-181c, miR-411, miR-126, miR-15a,
  miR-20b) seen in hyperglycemic conditions like diabetes are reverted by vitamin
  D3 via VDR signaling pathway. The adhesion of leukocyte and platelets to the endothelium
  is suppressed by vitamin D3 through downregulation of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression
  as well as proinflammatory cytokine IL-6. This illustration was created using BioRender.com
