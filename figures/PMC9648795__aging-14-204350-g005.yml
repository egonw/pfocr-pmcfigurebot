caption: Genes differentially expressed in correlation with ZNF320 and enriched GO
  annotations, KEGG pathway of ZNF320 correlated genes in HCC. (A) Pearson test was
  used to analyze the association between ZNF320 and genes differently expressed in
  HCC, red indicates positively correlated genes, and green indicates negatively correlated
  genes. (B, C) The top 50 genes positively and negatively relative to ZNF320 in HCC
  were shown by heat maps. (Dâ€“F) Significant Gene Ontology terms of the top genes
  most positively relative to ZNF320, including biological processes (BP), molecular
  function (MF), and cell component (CC). (G) Significant KEGG pathways of the top
  genes most positively associated with ZNF320.
article_title: ZNF320 is a hypomethylated prognostic biomarker involved in immune
