caption: Relevant pathways and overall reaction equations of the different modules
  (regarding substrate, product, NADH equivalents and CO2) for succinate production
  from glucose in V. natriegens. (A) Glucose dissimilation to pyruvate and possible
  NADH regeneration through acetate formation. Required reactions for succinate production
  from pyruvate following (B) the reductive branch, (C) the oxidative branch of the
  TCA cycle and (D) the glyoxylate pathway are highlighted in magenta, green and orange
  respectively. Abbreviations as in Fig.â€‰.
