caption: A summary of the various avenues within the gut-liver-brain axis that may
  be perturbed in patients with chronic liver disease. Original references for these
  avenues are found in the main body of the text. (Blue) highlights the impact of
  microbial derived metabolites, secondary bile acids, and potentially neuropeptides
  on gut environment and systemic adaptive immune cell function in the setting of
  inflammatory CNS conditions. (Red) Highlights various microbial-derived products
  including short chain fatty acids [butyrate, acetate, etc.] and neurotransmitters
  that may potentially impact CNS function in the setting of chronic liver disease.
  (Purple) A circuit whereby hepatic afferent vagal nerves indirectly sense luminal
  contents and relay resulting neural signals to the brain stem. The brain stem in
  turn, via parasympathetic efferent neurons, impacts the maintenance of T regulatory
  cells in the intestine. (Black) An additional pathway whereby meningeal NK cells
  produce interferon gamma to impact astrocyte function with a resulting modulation
  of CNS inflammation. The ability of the NK cells to produce interferon gamma is
  dependent on the microbiome. (Green) Liver immune and stromal cell derived cytokines
  can impact the blood-brain barrier function and recruitment of mononuclear cells
  to the CNS. This can enhance sickness behavior development in the setting of liver
  injury. Created with BioRender.com.
