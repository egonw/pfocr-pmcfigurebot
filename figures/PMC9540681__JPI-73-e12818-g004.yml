caption: 'Unified pathway of the common Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
  pathways—the neonatal cerebral hypoxic–ischemic (NCHI) pathway. The unified pathway,
  also called the NCHI pathway, was elaborated from the interchange of information
  between the KEGG pathways resulting from the bioinformatic analysis of the upregulated microRNAs
  (miRNAs) in a neonate with neonatal encephalopathy (NE) and in hypoxic–ischemic
  (HI) rats both treated with melatonin. Herein, the main actors (in yellow and green)
  involved in HI brain injury mechanisms and positively modulated by melatonin signaling
  pathways like those related to the calcium signaling pathway, MAPK, the cell cycle,
  mTOR, and ErbB, even if not in common between NE neonate and HI rats treated with
  melatonin (Supporting Information: Table ), are tightly connected to, and sometimes
  part of, the glioma and long‐term potentiation KEGG pathways. In green are highlighted
  the effectors whose expression levels were evaluated by our group in this manuscript
  and in our previous work. PKCα, activated by calcium‐dependent mechanisms and also
  modulated by PKB/Akt checkpoint, regulates the downstream redox and antiapoptotic
  state, the cell migration, and the mitosis. Akt is directly involved in the mTOR
  cascade, and hence in cell survival, its signaling is also strictly controlled by
  PTEN and Ras, a key factor in both Akt and ERK cascade and at the same time is modulated
  by PKCα. ERK, as part of the MAPK signaling pathway, is strongly related to downstream
  results such as cell growth, proliferation, and cell cycle. The latter is influenced
  by the p53 signaling pathway, in particular by Bax and Bak, death promoters: melatonin
  can reduce Bax translocation to the mitochondria resulting in an antiapoptotic outcome.'
