caption: (A) NT2D1 cell count after 48 h of culture in control condition (CTRL), or
  in medium supplemented with 40 ng/mL HGF, or 5 μM U0126, or the combination of both
  treatments (U0126 + HGF). As expected HGF administration causes a significant increase
  of cell number (** vs. CTRL p < 0.001). Conversely, U0126 alone or in combination
  with HGF triggers a significant reduction in cell number not only with respect to
  HGF treated samples (** vs. §§ p < 0.001), but also compared to control samples
  (CTRL vs. §§ p < 0.001). The experiment was repeated three times, and each experiment
  performed in triplicate. We reported in the graph the mean values ± S.E.M. (B) Cell
  cycle analysis of NT2D1 cells cultured for 8, 12, 16, 24 h in medium supplemented
  or not supplemented with U0126. The graph illustrated the mean percentage of cells
  for each phase of cell cycle ± S.E. We reported a significant increase of the percentage
  of G1 phase NT2D1 cells after 8 h, 12, 16 h U0126 administration (* p < 0.05). The
  experiment was repeated three times, and each experiment performed in triplicate.
