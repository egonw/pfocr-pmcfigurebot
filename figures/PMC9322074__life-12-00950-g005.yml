caption: 'The effect of melatonin on UVB-induced NT levels in HDFs. The cells were
  pretreated with 1 µM of melatonin for 1 h, further irradiated with 0.1 J/cm2 of
  UVB for 6 s, and then incubated for 0, 24, 48, and 72 h in cell culture medium containing
  1 µM of melatonin. Results are expressed as nM/µg protein and represented as mean
  ± SD of three independent experiments of pooled HDFs of ten healthy donors. C: untreated
  and non-irradiated control; M: only 1 h of melatonin treatment; UVB: UVB-irradiated;
  UVB+M: UVB-irradiated after 1 h melatonin pretreatment. * p < 0.001.'
