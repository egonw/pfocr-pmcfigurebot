figure_title: Differentially expressed canonical signaling pathways in Vesiculovax-vaccinated
  macaques
caption: Heatmap of the most significantly upregulated and downregulated canonical
  pathways in survivor versus fatal subjects based on functional enrichment of differentially
  expressed transcripts (Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) corrected p-value
  less than 0.05) in vaccinated survivor (n = 10) versus fatal (n = 8) samples. Cohorts
  were examined at early (3 DPI), mid (6 DPI), and late disease (10 DPI, or the terminal
  time point in fatal cases). DPI, days post infection. Corresponding z-scores were
  plotted. Red indicates high expression; blue indicates low expression; white indicates
  no difference in expression; gray indicates insufficient transcripts mapping to
  the pathway.
