caption: Mechanistic details of Hippo-YAP signaling pathway in human cells. (A) If
  the Hippo pathway is switched off or inactivated, YAP/TAZ remain unphosphorylated
  and are translocated into the nucleus to bind TEAD group of transcription factors,
  therefore, regulating the transcription of gene(s) necessitated for cell proliferation
  and survival. (B) Upon activation of Hippo signaling pathway, numerous biochemical,
  mechanical and physical cues bring about MST1/2 and LATS1/2 phosphorylation. Phosphorylated
  LATS1/2 Kinases further phosphorylate YAP/TAZ, therefore, engaging either 14-3-3
  or Ubiquitin proteins to mediate YAP/TAZ cytoplasmic retention or ubiquitylation/
  proteasomal degradation, respectively.
