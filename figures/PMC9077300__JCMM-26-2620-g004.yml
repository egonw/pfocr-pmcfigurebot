caption: LncRNA FOXD2‐AS1 was highly expressed in glioma tissues and cells as well
  as GSCs. A, LncRNA FOXD2‐AS1 expression predicted in GSE104267 (p = 1.482E‐07).
  The box on the left represents expression of lncRNA FOXD2‐AS1 in normal tissues
  and the box on the right represents expression in cancer tissues. B, A box plot
  displaying lncRNA FOXD2‐AS1 expression in glioma samples (left) and normal samples
  (right) from TCGA database using GEPIA. C, Survival curve of patients with glioma
  regarding lncRNA FOXD2‐AS1 expression from TCGA database using GEPIA (HR = 1.8,
  p = 0.032). D, LncRNA FOXD2‐AS1 expression in glioma tissues and normal tissues
  detected by RT‐qPCR (n = 26). E, A Kaplan–Meier one‐way survival analysis according
  to lncRNA FOXD2‐AS1 expression, followed by log‐rank test (n = 26). F, FOXD2‐AS1
  expression in glioma cell lines determined using RT‐qPCR. G, Expression of lncRNA
  FOXD2‐AS1 and GSC markers (OCT4, SOX2, Nanog, Nestin and CD133) determined using
  RT‐qPCR. H, Expression of Nestin and GFAP in GSCs determined by immunofluorescence.
  I, CD133+ GSCs selected using flow cytometry. J, LncRNA FOXD2‐AS1 expression in
  GSCs determined using RT‐qPCR. * p < 0.05. Measurement data were expressed as mean ± standard
  deviation. Paired t‐test was used to analyse comparison within group. Unpaired t‐test
  was adopted to analyse differences between two groups. Differences among multiple
  groups were analysed by one‐way ANOVA, followed by a Tukey multiple comparisons
  post‐test. Comparisons among multiple groups at different time points were performed
  with two‐way ANOVA. Cell experiments were conducted three times independently.
