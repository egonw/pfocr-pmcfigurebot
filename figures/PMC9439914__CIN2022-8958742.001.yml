caption: Volcano plot shows the DEGs between siSIRT1 and normal control samples. Fold
  change (FC) > 1 (in red) or < −1 (in blue) with adjusted P values or FDR <0.05 are
  differentially increased or reduced in siSIRT1 samples relative to normal control
  samples. (a) Volcano plot performed by limma; (b) volcano plot performed by edgeR.
