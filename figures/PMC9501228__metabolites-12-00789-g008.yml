caption: The crosstalk between JAs and SLs pathways. (A) The abundance of JA and JA-lle
  in d10, d3, d14, and wild-type plants. The data were represented as mean ± SD of
  two biological replicates. The Student’s t-test analysis indicated a significant
  difference (* p < 0.05). (B) MapMan-based “JA synthesis” of DEGs that regulated
  in three groups. The small heatmap in each section of the diagram shows the DEGs
  mapped to the pathway, and a small square indicates a transcript. Red and yellow
  indicate upregulated genes in each group; blue and green mean downregulated genes
  in each group. (C) Genes related to JAs synthesis, signaling, and degradation. Heatmaps
  of DEGs were drawn using the log2 (FC) value obtained from the pairwise comparison
  of samples. Red and blue indicate higher and lower fold change which scale by row.
