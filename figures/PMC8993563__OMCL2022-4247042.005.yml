caption: 'COS improved mitochondrial function in H2O2-stimulated KGN cells. (a) MitoTracker
  was stained on KGN by immunofluorescence. (b) The statistics histogram of immunofluorescence
  expressed fluorescent intensity. (c) JC-1 red, JC-1 green, and merge images. (d)
  Statistics data were expressed in terms of the ratio of JC-1 red to JC-1 green.
  Data are presented as the means ± SEM (n = 3). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, or ∗∗∗P <
  0.001 vs. the control group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, or ###P < 0.001 vs. the H2O2
  group. Scale bar: (a): 100 μm; (c): 50 μm.'
