caption: Enrichment analysis and visualization of Gene Ontology (GO) results for DEGs
  in response to 5-demethyl NOB treatment. (a) Significantly enriched GO biological
  processes (BPs) in THP-1 cells treated with vehicle vs. 5-demethyl NOB (40 μM) were
  analyzed by REVIGO. The scatterplot represents functional clusters. The bubble color
  and size represent the p values and the frequency of the GO BP in the database,
  respectively. (b) Heatmap of enriched GO BP terms in response to 5-demethyl NOB
  (40 μM) treatment. GO processes listed in the upper and lower panels are terms of
  upregulated and downregulated DEGs, respectively. Only some of the significantly
  representative GO terms are shown.
