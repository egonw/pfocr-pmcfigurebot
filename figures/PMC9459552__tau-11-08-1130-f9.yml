caption: Pathway enrichment and immune infiltration of ferroptosis subtypes differ
  among prostate cancer risk groups. (A) Enrichment analysis of metabolic pathways
  between the high- and low-risk groups. (B) Heat map showing immune infiltration
  based on CIBERSORT algorithms. (C) Heat map showing immune infiltration based on
  ssGSEA algorithms. (D) Boxplots showing differences in immune cell infiltration
  between the 2 ferroptosis high- and low-risk groups. (E,F) Bar plot and boxplot
  showing the relative abundance of ferroptotic immune cell infiltration in 500 prostate
  cancer patients. (G) Violin plot showing the ratio of StromalScore, ImmuneScore,
  and ESTIMATEScore between high-risk and low-risk groups. **, P<0.01; ns, P>0.05.
  GSVA, Gene set variation analysis; ssGSEA, single-sample gene set enrichment analysis.
