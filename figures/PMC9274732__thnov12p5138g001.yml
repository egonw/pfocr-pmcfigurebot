caption: Molecular Comparison on KRAS-Mut versus-wild type colorectal cancer. (A)
  A schematic plot summarized the KRAS signaling pathway and relevant inhibitors of
  each node. (B) Kaplan-Meier curves for patients with KRAS-Mut and KRAS-WT groups
  in the TCGA-COAD/READ cohort. (C) Subgroup analysis estimating clinical prognostic
  value between KRAS-WT and KRAS-Mut type in TCGA cohort and cancer stage by univariate
  Cox regression. The length of the horizontal line represented the 95% confidence
  interval for each group. The vertical dotted line represented the hazard ratio (HR)
  of all patients. (D) Top enriched gene pathways with RNA expression profile in KRAS-Mut
  and -WT subgroups from TCGA cohort as assessed by using the GSEA algorithm. (E)
  Scatterplots showing significance of RNA, protein (red), phosphorylation site (blue)
  (signed -log10 p-value) abundance changes between KRAS-Mut and WT tumors in CPTAC
  cohort as determined using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. All identified sites are
  represented and statistically significant gene (FDR < 0.05) specified by triangles.
  (F) Arm-level somatic copy-number alteration (SCNA) events in KRAS-Mut versus -WT.
  Red denotes amplification and blue denotes deletion. (G) Comparison of the aneuploidy
  score between KRAS-Mut and WT subtype in TCGA. (H) The relationships among the top
  25 mutated genes (including KRAS) with different somatic mutations frequency.
