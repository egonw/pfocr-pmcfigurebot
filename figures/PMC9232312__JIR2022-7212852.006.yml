caption: IPA of the IF/TA-related DEGs and construction of ceRNA network for diagnostic
  genes. (a) Canonical pathway analysis. Blue indicates that the corresponding pathway
  is inhibited and orange indicates activation. (b) Disease and functional pathway
  analysis. (c) The ceRNA network with 310 nodes and 392 edges were reconstructed
  to further reveal the possible role network of diagnostic genes. (red square, mRNA;
  yellow diamond, lncRNA; and blue circles, miRNA).
