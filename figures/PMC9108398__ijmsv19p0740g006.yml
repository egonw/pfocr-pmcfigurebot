caption: 'Effect of NAC on the VCM-activated P38 MAPK/JNK signaling pathway. (A) Phosphorylation
  levels of P38 MAPK and JNK in HK-2 cells treated with VCM and NAC. (B) Phosphorylation
  levels of P38 MAPK and JNK in HK-2 cells treated with VCM and vitamin C. Data was
  performed from three independent experiments and presented as mean Â± SEM. *p<0.05,
  **p<0.01, significantly higher than that in the control group. #p<0.05, significantly
  lower than that in the VCM group. Significance was analyzed by ANOVA followed by
  Tukey''s test.'
