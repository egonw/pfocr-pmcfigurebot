caption: 'Characterization of bioactive compounds. (A) TLC chromatograms of bioassay-guided
  purification from silica gel column chromatography. Eluent of (90–10) % Hexane to
  (10–90) % Ethyl acetate gradient were used to elute the fractions. The eluted fractions
  (1–10) and crude methanol extract (C) were analyzed by TLC, using 60 F254 silica
  gel at room temperature. TLC was run at Hexane: Ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v) and detected
  by sulphuric acid spotting test. (B) HPLC chromatograms of isolated and purified
  compound: HPLC analysis was performed on a SHIMADZU LC-20AP 02027/02028 pump coupled
  to a SHIMADZU SPD-20A 40766 UV–vis detector, set at 280 nm. (C–E) 13C NMR, 1H-NMR,
  and mass spectrometry spectra of the purified compound as described elsewhere (F)
  Chemical structure of planispine A.'
