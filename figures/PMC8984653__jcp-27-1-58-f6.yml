figure_title: The lipid contents of HepG2 cells after stained by Oil red O dye and
  hematoxylin
caption: HepG2 cells (1.9 × 105 cells/well) seeded in a 24-well plate. After preculture
  for 24 hours, the cells were cultured in normal medium, combined fatty acids (CFA)
  medium and 10 μM of 6-(methylsulfinyl) hexyl isothiocyanate (6-MSITC)-added CFA
  medium for 0 hour (A) and 48 hours (B). The magnification is 200× (A). The cells
  were stained with 60 % Oil red O dye and hematoxylin. The red spots in the figures
  represent lipid. Histogram shows the densitometric analysis of red spots normalized
  to control medium. The data represent relative fold to respective control (C). The
  data were from triplicate tests. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.05.
