caption: Deficient mitochondria fusion mitigates the DNA damage response signaling.
  (A) MFN1 stably depleted U2OS cells were treated with increasing concentrations
  of phleomycin (Phleo), a DSB-mimetic reagent for 2 h. The cells were lysed and immunoblotted
  with the indicated antibodies and quantification was shown as fold change relative
  to the control. Bars represent mean ± SEM from three independent experiments; *
  P < 0.05 versus control by two-sided unpaired Student's t-test. (B) Mitochondrial
  morphology visualized by Mito-Tracker () was quantified by mitochondrial fragmentation
  count (MFC). Bars represent mean ± SEM from three independent experiments; nshCtrl= 32,
  nshMFN1= 22 cells. ** P < 0.005 versus control siRNA by two-sided unpaired Student's
  t-test. (C) U2OS cells transfected with OPA1 shRNA were treated with Phleo for 2
  h and subjected to immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. Band intensities
  of the γH2AX levels in immunoblot were measured by using imageJ. Bars represent
  mean ± SEM from three independent experiments. *** P < 0.001 versus control shRNA
  by two-sided unpaired Student's t-test. (D) U2OS cells transfected with OPA1 shRNA
  were treated with Phleo for 2 h and immunostained with MitoTracker (red). Bars represent
  mean ± SEM from three independent experiments; nshCtrl= 25, nshOPA1= 28 cells. ***
  P < 0.001 versus control shRNA by two-sided unpaired Student's t-test. Scale bar,
  10 μm. (E) Myc-hFis1 plasmid was transfected into U2OS cells and treated with Phleo
  for 2 h. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with indicated antibodies.
  Bars represent mean ± SEM from three independent experiments. *** P < 0.001 versus
  control shRNA by two-sided unpaired Student's t-test. (F) Myc-hFis1 plasmid was
  transfected into U2OS cells and treated with Phleo for 2 h. Cells were subjected
  to immunofluorescence stained with anti-Myc (green) antibody and Mitotracker (red).
  Mitochondrial morphological change was quantified by determination of MFC. Bars
  represent mean ± SEM from three independent experiments; npcDNA= 30, nMyc-hFis1= 28
  cells. *** P < 0.001 versus control by two-sided unpaired Student's t-test. Scale
  bar, 10 μm. (G) MFN1 depleted U2OS cells reconstituted with Flag-MFN1 were treated
  with Phleo for 2 h, and subjected to immunoblotting. Bars represent mean ± SEM from
  three independent experiments. *** P < 0.001 versus control shRNA by two-sided unpaired
  Student's t-test. (H) U2OS cells were exposed to 25, 50 mM of glucose for 5 h before
  treatment with Phleo for additional 2 h. Cells were stained with MitoTracker (red)
  followed by immunostaining with anti-γH2AX (green) antibody and DAPI (blue). Lower
  panel (left) show the percentage of cells containing >10 γH2AX foci per cell (left)
  in three independent experiments; nnon= 278, nglu 25= 310, nglu 50= 286. Lower right
  panel shows the MFC value. Bars represent mean ± SEM from three independent experiments;
  nnon= 32, nglu 25= 17, nglu 50= 21 cells. *** P < 0.001 versus control by two-sided
  unpaired Student's t-test. Scale bar, 10 μm. (I) U2OS cells were subjected to the
  50 mM of glucose treatment for 5 h and released to fresh medium. The cells were
  pre-treated with Phleo for 2 h before harvest as indicated times and immunoblotted
  with the indicated antibodies.
