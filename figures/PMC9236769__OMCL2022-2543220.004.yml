caption: 'Downregulation of FGFR1 inhibited tube formation and migration of ECDHCC-1
  cells stimulated by DJ-1. (a) and (b) Knockdown of FGFR1 by shRNA was confirmed
  by qRT-PCR and western blotting analysis. (c) Cell viability was analyzed by CCK8.
  (d–f) The effect of FGFR1 knockdown on DJ-1 inducing angiogenesis on EDCHCC-1 cells
  was assessed for tube formation assay (d), the number of nodes (e), and total length
  (f) of capillary tube. n = 3 for all groups. (g) and (h) The effect of FGFR1 knockdown
  on DJ-1 inducing migration on EDCHCC-1 cells was examined. Photographs (×20) were
  taken at 12, 24, and 36 h, respectively, after treatment with 15 μg/mL DJ-1 (g).
  Relative scratch width was quantified by image J software (h). ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P
  < 0.01 versus Con. (original magnifications: ×200 for fluorescence).'
