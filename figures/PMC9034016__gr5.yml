caption: N6-methyladenosine (m6A) regulatory machinery was indispensable for establishing
  cs-lncRNA repertoire. (A) The expression changes of decreased and increased cs-lncRNAs
  in METTL14 knockout NHDF cells compared with control after VACV-70mer (dsDNA) treatment.
  (B) The observed (labeled as a vertical red line) and expected (represented as the
  histogram) downregulated proportion of increased cs-lncRNA (left) and upregulated
  proportion of decreased cs-lncRNA (right) in METTL14 knockout NHDF cells compared
  with that of control after dsDNA treatment. The expected proportion was estimated
  using 1,000 permutations based on all expressed lncRNAs. (C) The correlation of
  expression changes of cs-lncRNAs between four cGAS-STING signaling stimulations
  in HFF-1 cells and dsDNA stimulation in METTL14 knockout NHDF cells. (D) The overlap
  of identified m6A peaks before (unstimulated) and after (stimulated) dsDNA treatment.
  In total, 3,818 m6A peaks were specifically gained (gain) and 1,904 Pol II peaks
  were lost (loss) after dsDNA stimulation compared with unstimulated status. (E)
  The observed (labeled as a vertical red line) and expected (represented as the histogram)
  proportion of increased cs-lncRNA (left) and decreased cs-lncRNA (right) harboring
  gain of m6A peaks in their transcripts. (F) The observed (labeled as a vertical
  red line) and expected (represented as the histogram) proportion of increased cs-lncRNA
  (left) and decreased cs-lncRNA (right) harboring loss of m6A peaks in their transcripts.
  For both (E) and (F), the expected proportion was estimated using 1,000 permutations
  based on all expressed lncRNAs. (G) The heatmap of the expression changes of key
  signaling transduction components of the cGAS-STING pathway in METTL14 knockout
  NHDF cells compared with control with (6 h and 12 h) and without dsDNA treatment.
  (H) The correlation of expression changes of cs-lncRNAs between IFNβ treatment in
  IFNAR1-KO HFF-1 cells and dsDNA stimulation in METTL14 knockout NHDF cells. (For
  interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is
