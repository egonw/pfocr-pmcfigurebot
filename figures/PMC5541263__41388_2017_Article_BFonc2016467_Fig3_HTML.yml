caption: 'Lost nuclear RARβ/TET2 and deficient miR-200c expression is correlated with
  ATRA resistance in high-grade, aggressive breast cancer. (a, b) Representative IHC
  staining images showing expression levels of RARβ, TET2 and miR-200c in 140 human
  breast tissue specimens, including low-grade tumors (a: tumor grade I, LG) and high-grade
  tumors (b: tumor grades II–III, HG, arrowhead indicates positive nuclear staining,
  scale bar: 100 μm). (c) The nuclear/cytoplasmic RARβ, nuclear/cytoplasmic TET2 and
  total miR-200c levels were scored and their correlation with tumor grade was analyzed
  by Chi-square analysis. N, nuclear staining; C, cytoplasmic staining; (−), negative-low
  staining; (+), strong-positive staining. (d) Pearson’s correlation analysis of ATRA
  sensitivity (S) and resistance (R) defined by ATRA-EC50 for tumor sphere suppression
  with the relative expression level of nuclear TET2 showing that ATRA-EC50 is negatively
  correlated with nuclear TET2 level (r=−0.8, P=0.02). ATRA-resistant cells (n=11,
  grouped in red circle) that include seven triple-negative primary tumor samples
  (for example, PT1), as well as BT549, MDA-MB-231, BT20, and SUM149PT breast cancer
  cell lines; ATRA-sensitive cells (n=12, grouped in black circle) that include six
  luminal and one HER2+ primary tumor samples, as well as MCF7, T47D, ZR75-1 breast
  cancer cell lines and MCF10A and MCF12A cell lines. Box plots showing (e) the relative
  5hmc levels, and (f) the relative miR-200c levels in ATRA-sensitive (S) cells and
  ATRA-resistant (R) cells shown in d. R, resistant cells with ATRA-EC50 of sphere
  suppression ⩾10−6M; S, sensitive cells with ATRA-EC50 of sphere suppression <10−6 M.
  Relative expression levels of nuclear TET2, 5 hmc, and miR-200c levels were determined
  by expression ratios to normalized total input lysates, total input genomic DNA
  and RNU6B expression, respectively. Error bars denote ±s.d.'
