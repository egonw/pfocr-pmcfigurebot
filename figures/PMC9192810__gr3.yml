caption: Paired analysis of irradiated and non-irradiated liver transcriptome.Time-dependent
  PCA analysis displaying the control tissue in black, HIGH-irradiated tissue in red,
  and LOW-irradiated in blue. The paired HIGH- and LOW-irradiated tissue (coming from
  the same mouse) were represented with the same shape (A). Bar graph illustrating
  the numbers of upregulated and downregulated genes issued from comparing the paired
  HIGH- vs. LOW-irradiated sample (B). Venn diagram displaying the upregulated genes
  (C) and downregulated genes (D) at the different time post-irradiation. Pathway
  enrichment analysis depicting only the most relevant summary terms for each time
  point; day-1 p <5x10-15; day-6 p <4x10-4; week-6 p <1x10-10; week-20 p <5x10-15
  (Hypergeometric test) (E-H). PCA, principal component analysis.
