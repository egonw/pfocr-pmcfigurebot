figure_title: GluCer directly impairs mitochondria and lysosome function leading to
  S100A9 upregulation and a senescence-like phenotype in dopaminergic (DA) neurons
caption: a, LysoTracker staining of wild-type (WT) N2A cells treated with DMSO control,
  2.5 mM GluCer, or 40 mM GluCer for 6 days, demonstrating a significant dose-dependent
  increase in lysosomal content (corrected total cellular fluorescence) upon lipid
  treatment. b, Seahorse analysis of lipid-treated mesencephalic DA (mDA) neurons
  showing dose-dependent alterations in oxygen consumption rate (2 ng/ml is 2.8 mM).
  c, Treatment with GENZ-112638, an inhibitor of GluCer synthesis, mitigates the effects
  of lipid treatment on mitochondrial function. d, e SA-b-Gal-based senescence assay
  performed to evaluate senescence induction after 7 days of GluCer treatment in N2A
  cells (d) and mature WT human mDA neurons (e), demonstrating that GluCer treatment
  is sufficient to induce senescence in both cell types. f, RNA-seq analysis of WT
  human DA neurons treated with DMSO, 2.5 mM GluCer, or 40 mM GluCer, revealing increased
  S100A9 expression following a 7-day lipid treatment g, Overview of the SATB1-MIR22HG-GBA-GluCer
  pathway. The senescence regulator SATB1 acts as a negative regulator of MIR22HG
  expression. Decreased SATB1 levels lead to increased MIR22HG expression. Following
  nuclear processing, miR-22-3p targets GBA mRNA, reducing its transcription. This
  results in reduced GCase activity and the consequent accumulation of its substrate
  GluCer, a cerebroside that impairs mitochondrial and lysosomal function. GluCer
  accumulation leads to elevated ROS production and increased S100A9 expression, ultimately
  driving cellular senescence. Importantly, the genes SATB1, MIR22HG, and GBA (red
  stars) are associated with Parkinson’s Disease. During aging, SATB1 and GBA levels
  decrease (red hourglasses), while MIR22HG, GluCer, S100A9, and ROS levels increase
  (green hourglasses), rendering DA neurons more vulnerable. Both S100A9 and miR22
  induce cellular senescence (; ).
