figure_title: Timescales for single cell and lattice transitions
caption: (a) The distribution of transition waiting times from Receiver to Sender
  as a function of NEXT and DEXT in a simulation starting from randomized initial
  conditions with white noise amplitude of σwhite = 1300 for 9000 hr after a 1000
  hr relaxation period. Each dot represents the average switching event, while the
  x- and y-coordinates represent the average levels of Delta and Notch in neighboring
  cells during the transition. The color scale depicts the waiting time before the
  transition event. The “correct” state region (a Receiver surrounded by Sender-like
  environment) is circled, and dots within this region exhibit the longest transition
  waiting time. (b) Same as (a) but for σshot = 13. (c) Same as (a) but at a high
  white noise level (σwhite = 2000). These larger fluctuations also flip cells from
  the “correct” to “incorrect” state. (d) Same as (a) but for high shot noise (σshot
  = 20).

  in the Notch-Delta signaling pathway.
