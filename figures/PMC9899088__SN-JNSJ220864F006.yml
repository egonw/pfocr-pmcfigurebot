caption: Summary of pulvinar-cortical domain preference systems. The left hemisphere
  and right hemisphere are shown () in the top and bottom panels, respectively. The
  brain regions are shown in the approximate areas. Arrow indicates the direction
  of information flow. Solid line indicates the modulation found in our study. Dashed
  lines indicate the path found (or speculated) by previous articles. Yellow represents
  modulation or activation by animal images. Blue represents modulation or activation
  by tool images. The LGN-PVC-VOTC pathway has been described by many previous articles
  (e.g., ). The bidirectional path between the VOTC and right amygdala was speculated
  by  and . The bidirectional tool modulation between the dorsal pathway (parietal)
  and the ventral pathway (VOTC) was indicated by , , and . Amy, Amygdala; Pul, pulvinar;
  VOTC, ventral occipital temporal cortex, including lateral occipitotemporal cortex
  and fusiform gyrus; PVC, primary visual cortex.
