caption: 'The UPS system mediated signaling pathway and regulatory factors during
  osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells are shown. (A) FGF signaling:
  Smurfl inhibits JNK signaling by promoting MEKK2 ubiquitination and degradation,
  and negatively regulates FGF signaling. Cbl can reduce the ubiquitination of PDGFR
  and FGFR2, thus inhibiting FGF signaling. (B) BMP signaling: USP4 can deubiquitinate
  TI3RI and Smad4, and enhance BMP signaling. USP9X can antagonize Smad4 monoubiquitination
  and enhance BMP signaling. USP34 can activate Smad1/5/8 to enhance BMP signaling.
  UCH-L3 can deubiquitinate and stabilize Smadl, and enhance BMP signaling. OTUB1
  deubiquitinates the p-Smad2/3 complex and enhances BMP signaling. Smurfl and Smurf2
  induce Smad1/5/8 ubiquitination and negatively regulates BMP signaling. Smurfl and
  WWP1 promote ubiquitination and degradation of JunB and inhibit BMP signaling. Itch
  enhances JunB by ubiquitinating ReIA/Re1B and positively regulates BMP signaling.
  RSP5 induces ubiquitination of PKB/Akt and positively regulates BMP signaling. TRIM21
  accelerated the degradation of Akt to enhance BMP signaling. Cbl reduces BMP signaling
  by inhibiting PI3K-PKB/Akt pathway and ubiquiting BMP2. TRAF4 positively regulates
  BMP signaling by ubiquitinating Smurf2. (C) Hedgehog signaling: OTUB2 enhances Hh
  signaling through deubiquitinating Gli2. (D) Wnt signaling: USP4 enhances Wnt signaling
  through deubiquitinating and stabilizing P-catenin. Conversely, USP4 inhibits Wnt
  signaling by deubiquitinating Dvl. USP9X enhances Wnt signaling through deubiquitinating
  Dv12. USP8 enhances Wnt signaling through deubiquitinating FZD5. USP53 inhibits
  proteasome degradation of p-catenin by interacting with FBXO31 and enhance Wnt signaling.
  USP7 can activate Wnt signaling through deubiquitinating P-catenin. USP26 can activate
  Wnt signaling by stabilizing p-catenin. Rnf185 inhibits the Wnt signaling by promoting
  ubiquitin and degradation of Dv12. CDC20 enhances Wnt signaling by promoting P65
  degradation in an APC11-dependent manner. (E) Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling: A20
  inhibits polyubiquitination of TRAF6. (F) MSX1: USP11 can deubiquitinate the MSX1
  protein. (G) RUNX2: USP34 can stabilize RUNX2. WWP2 catalyzes the monoubiquitination
  of RUNX2. c-Cbl mediates STAT5 ubiquitination and inhibits RUNX2. Skp2 targets Runx2
  degradation. TRIM16 stabilizes RUNX2 protein levels. (H) Osteoblast: MYSM1 can affect
  the maturation and differentiation of osteoblasts. Fbw7 negatively regulates Osx
  protein stability and osteoblast differentiation.'
