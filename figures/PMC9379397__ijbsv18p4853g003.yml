caption: TMTC3 was regulated by ΔNp63 at the transcriptional level. A. Schematic diagram
  depicting the positions of the binding sites of TP63 in the TMTC3 promoter from
  the JASPAR database. TSS, transcription starting site. B. ChIP-qPCR analysis of
  the interaction between ΔNp63 and the TMTC3 promoter. IgG was used as a negative
  control. *, p < 0.05, **, p < 0.01. C. The luciferase activity of TMTC3 after stimulation
  with ΔNp63. ***, p < 0.001. D. The mRNA expression of TMTC3 after overexpressing
  ΔNp63. E. The ΔNp63 levels in SCCs cells treated with complete medium or with amino
  acid and FBS-deficient medium for 24 h. F and G. The correlation between TP63 and
  TMTC3 in EC (F) and other SCCs, including CESC, HNSC, LUSC (G) from GEPIA2 database.
