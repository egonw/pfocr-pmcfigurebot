caption: 'GSK-3β regulates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in IL-1β-induced inflammation.
  Phosphorylation and total expression of GSK-3β (a) and (b) and β-catenin (c) and
  (d) were detected by western blotting. (e)-(h) visualization and quantification
  of the expression of nuclear β-catenin. All results are expressed as the mean ±
  SD (n = 3). NS: not significant, ∗P < 0.05, and ∗∗P < 0.01.'
article_title: Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3β inhibits BMSCs Chondrogenesis in Inflammation
