caption: 'CTSC was overexpressed and associated with tumor progression in lung adenocarcinoma.
  A. Expression of CTSC protein in lung adenocarcinoma tissues. Lung adenocarcinoma
  tissues are immunohistochemically stained with an anti-CTSC antibody. The four panels
  show normal tissues, tumors without lymph node metastasis, tumors with lymph node
  metastasis without recurrence, and tumors with lymph node metastasis with recurrence.
  Magnification: Ã— 400. B. The IHC score of CTSC is significantly higher in patients
  with lymph node metastasis than in those without. C. The IHC score of CTSC is significantly
  higher in patients with recurrence than in those without recurrence. D, E. Patients
  with high CTSC expression have significantly more lymph node metastasis than that
  in patients with low CTSC expression. F. The proportion of patients with locally
  advanced or metastatic disease is significantly higher in patients with high CTSC
  expression than in those with low CTSC expression. Comparisons between the two groups
  are performed using chi-squared tests and paired t-tests. *P < 0.1.'
