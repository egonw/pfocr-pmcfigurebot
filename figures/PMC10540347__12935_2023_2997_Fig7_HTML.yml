caption: SQLE increases tumor cell proliferation and inhibits cell apoptosis of Bca
  by regulating the PTEN/AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway through P53. (A) Protein expression
  levels of P53, PTEN, AKT, P-AKT, GSK3β, P-GSK3β, Bcl2, and Cyclin D1 in T24 and
  5637 cells; (B, C) The CCK-8 assay was used to assess the proliferation of shSQLE-treated
  tumor cells, NC-treated tumor cells, negative controls, and cells treated with shSQLE + PFT
  β from 0 to 96 h; (D) Representative images of the colony-forming assay; (E, F)
  Representative images of KI67 immunostaining showed that overexpression of P53 increased
  the proliferation of T24 and 5637 cells after SQLE knockdown; (G–I) Flow cytometry
  detected the early apoptosis and late apoptosis cell population in T24 and 5637.
  Data represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001, ns, not significant)
