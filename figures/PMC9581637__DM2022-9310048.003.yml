caption: RAP1B targets miR-30a-5p and reverses the effects of si-DLEU2 in Tca8113
  and CAL-27 cells. (a) Scatter plot shows differentially expressed mRNAs between
  the oral cancer and control groups. (b) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. (c) The
  key mRNAs affecting the MAPK signaling pathway were combined with putative target
  genes of miR-30a-5p in the starBase database to screen for suitable mRNAs. (d) Relative
  expression of DLEU2 in RWPE-2 and four oral cancer cell lines (C4-2, 22RV1, Tca8113,
  and CAL-27). (e) The TargetScan database predicts the binding sites of miR-30a-5p
  and RAP1B. (f) Dual-luciferase assay analysis of the binding of RAP1B to miR-30a-5p.
  (g) RT-qPCR analysis of the effect of si-DLEU2 on the expression of RAP1B in Tca8113
  and CAL-27 cells. (h) RT-qPCR verified the validity of overexpressing RAP1B plasmid.
  (i) Western blot verified the validity of overexpressing RAP1B plasmid. (j) RT-qPCR
  analysis of the reversal of DLEU2 expression by overexpressing RAP1B on si-DLEU2.
