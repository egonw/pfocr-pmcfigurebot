caption: 'Tagitinin C activates Nrf2-HO-1 signaling pathway. (A) Heat map showed differentially
  up-regulated genes in response to tagitinin C treatment measured using RNA-seq analysis.
  Low expression is depicted in white, and high expression is depicted in black. (B-C)
  Nrf2 and HO-1 mRNA was measured at indicated concentrations or time after treatment
  of tagitinin C. Data were presented as Mean ± SD. Statistical analysis was carried
  out between tagitinin C-treated group and DMSO group: * p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01, ***
  p ≤ 0.001.'
