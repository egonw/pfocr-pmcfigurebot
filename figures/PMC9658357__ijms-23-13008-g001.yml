caption: The process of Aβ1–42 formation and plaque deposition. Schematic diagram
  of the progressive cleavages of the amyloid beta (Aβ) precursor protein (APP) transmembrane
  domain. Aβ peptide is generated from APP processing via the amyloidogenic pathway,
  by the β and γ-secretases complex, which produces a peptide called sAPP-β (soluble
  ectodomain of APP-produced by β secretase) and CTF- β (C-Terminal Fragment by β
  secretase) fragment and foremost ACID peptide and different lengths of Aβ peptides,
  including Aβ42, which is more prone to aggregation and plaque formation than Aβ40
  and has stronger neurotoxicity and (see the text below for more details).
