figure_title: Effects of TMPRSS2 depletion on the anchorage‐independent growth and
  in vivo tumor growth of lung cancer cells
caption: 'AExpression of TMPRSS2 was examined by Western blots of four lung cancer
  cell lines (H460, A546, H1299, and H1975) and two normal fibroblasts (MRC5 and IMR90).B,
  CH1975 cells were infected with sh‐TMPRSS2 (sh‐TMPRSS2‐1 and sh‐TMPRSS2‐2) or empty
  vector (Vector). The stable clones of TMPRSS2 knockdown cells were analyzed for
  the expression of TMPRSS2 by Western blots (B) and their ability to perform anchorage‐independent
  growth in soft agar (C).D, EH1975‐shTMPRSS2‐1 cells were injected subcutaneously
  into mice (n = 9 per group), and the tumor growth of the implanted cells was measured
  (D). The excised tumors and their weights are shown in (E). Data information: The
  results shown in (A and B) are from one of three similar experiments. β‐actin was
  used as the loading control. The data shown in (C) represent the means ± SDs from
  three independent experiments. The results shown in (D) and (E) are presented as
  the means ± SDs of nine mice. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001 compared with
  vector control. (C) P‐values were determined by one‐sample t‐test. (D and E) P‐values
  were determined by two‐sample t‐test. Source data are available online for this
  figure.'
