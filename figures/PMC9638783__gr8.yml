caption: Potential mechanisms underlying the effects of ACSL4 on NEC(A and B) GO and
  KEGG enrichment analysis suggested that multiple immune-related signaling were enriched
  in NEC.(C–F) GSEA analysis showed that pathways including nod-like receptor signaling
  pathway (NES = 2.48, FDR = 0.000), JAK-STAT signaling pathway (NES = 2.03, FDR =
  0.000), and chemokine-signaling pathway (NES = 2.40, FDR = 0.000) were significantly
  enriched in the high-ACSL4 group compared with the low- ACSL4 group.(G) Main components
  of toll-like receptor signaling pathway, including TLR4, NFKB1, TLR5, CXCL8, IL6,
  IL1B, and CD14, were significantly increased in the high-ACSL4 group than in the
  low-ACSL4 group.

  and reveals the role of ACSL4 in immune disorders.
