caption: Expression patterns of starch and sucrose metabolism and glycolysis pathway
  genes in developing oil tea seeds. (A) Schematic of the starch and sucrose metabolism
  and glycolysis pathways and corresponding genes involved in the pathways. (B) Heat
  map showing expression patterns of genes involved in the metabolic pathways of developing
  oil tea seeds. (C) Heat map of genes involved in lipid metabolism. (D) qRT–PCR verification
  of expression patterns of the major genes involved in starch and sucrose synthesis
  and glycolysis pathways. All qRT–PCR data are expressed as means ± standard deviation
  (n = 3) from three independent experiments. STS, starch synthase; SUS, sucrose synthase;
  INVs, invertases; HXK, hexokinase; PGI, glucose phosphate isomerase; PPi-PFK, phosphofructokinase;
  ALDO, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  G3PDH, glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GK, phosphoglycerate kinase; PGM, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent
  phosphoglycerate mutase; ENO, enolase; PK, pyruvate kinase; Amy, amylase; TPI, triose
  phosphate isomerase; SPS, sucrose phosphate synthase.
