caption: 'After blocking K-Ras G13D mutation, the sensitivity to ERK pathway inhibitor
  SCH772984 reduced in HCT-116 but not HT-29 cells. The images show the sphere formation
  rates and numbers after the S7333 (4 µM for 72 h) or SCH772984 (200 nM for 48 h)
  alone and the combination treatment in HCT-116 and HT-29 cells (A). The sphere number
  counts show the significant increase after S7333 treatment and decrease after SCH772984
  treatment, compared with the control (B). However, there is a significant increase
  of spheroids by SCH772984 treatment after blocking the K-Ras mutation with S7333
  (B). The sphere size was obviously decreased after both S7333 and SCH772984 treatment
  alone (C). However, after blocking K-Ras mutation, SCH772984 treatment slightly
  increases the size (C). The Western blotting results show the protein levels of
  phosphorylated ERK (pERK) and total ERK protein (total ERK) in HCT-116 and HT-29
  cells after S7333, SCH772984, and combination treatment. The numbers on the protein
  bands represent densitometry analysis results (D). *: p < 0.05; **: p < 0.001; ***:
  p< 0.0001; ns: p > 0.05.'
