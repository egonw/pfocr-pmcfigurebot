figure_title: YTHDF2-mediated m6A modification drives the degradation of circ_ 0003215
caption: A, B Predicted m6A site and motif of circ_0003215 from SRAMP. C MeRIP assay
  indicating that circ_0003215 was highly enriched in m6A precipitated fraction. D
  Western blot analysis demonstrated that only YTHDF2 protein was pull-downed by circ_
  0003215 probe. E Flow diagram of RIP-qPCR and agarose gel electrophoresis for circ_0003215.
  F YTHDF2 RIP assay to detect circ_0003215 in CRC cells. G RT-qPCR analysis for the
  expression of circ_0003215 after YTHDF2 overexpression in CRC cells. H MeRIP assays
  for m6A-modified circ_0003215 in HT29 (left) and SW480 (right) cells treated with
  empty vector or YTHDF2 overexpression plasmid.

  phosphate pathway and malignancy of colorectal cancer through the miR-663b/DLG4/G6PD
  axis.
