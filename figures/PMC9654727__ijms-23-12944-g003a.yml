caption: 'Muscle strength and function of SAMP8 mice upon different time points in
  treatment groups (n = 5). (A) twitch force, (B) specific twitch force, (C) tetanic
  force and (D) specific twitch force of VIB group were significantly higher than
  in all other three groups at month 3 post treatment, while the Mg group presented
  dominantly higher muscle twitch and tetanic contraction parameters at month 4. No
  significant difference was found at month 2. (E) Grip strength of the Mg group was
  significantly higher than that of the other groups at month 3, and the Mg + VIB
  group presented significantly higher grip strength at month 4. * p < 0.05, ** p
  < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 and **** p < 0.0001. (F) Mg treatment and combination treatment
  showed a higher fatigue curve and significantly higher fatigue force value than
  the Con group at every time point at month 4. The Mg group compared with Con group:
  **** p < 0.0001. The VIB group compared with the Con group: ▴ p < 0.05, ▴▴ p < 0.01
  and the Mg + VIB group compared with the Con group: # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01.'
