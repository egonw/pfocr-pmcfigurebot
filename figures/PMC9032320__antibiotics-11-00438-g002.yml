caption: Pathway for the biosynthesis of albomycins. (A). Genetic organization of
  gene cluster for the biosynthesis of albomycins in S. griseus ATCC 700974. Genes
  from abmA to abmR were thought to be required for albomycin biosynthesis. (B). Proposed
  biosynthetic pathway of albomycins. AbmQ was highlighted to show the unusual domain
  organization. AbmG, a homologue of deoxycytidine kinase, was proposed to be responsible
  for the formation of 7. Biosynthetic process from 7 to 12 was believed to be catalyzed
  sequentially by AbmH, AbmD, AbmF, AbmK, and AbmJ. AbmE and AbmI were responsible
  for the tailoring modifications of thionucleoside moiety.
