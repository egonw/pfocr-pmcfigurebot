caption: Viability of cells treated with 100 µM IM, 2,500 nM Das, 100 ng/ml LPS, 10
  ng/ml TNF and/or 50 µg/ml Verb K562. Cells were treated for (A) 48 h and (B) 72
  h. *P<0.05 untreated control cells vs. all other groups, ∆P<0.05 IM + Verb vs. IM
  and Verb, ∑P<0.05 Das + Verb vs. Das and Verb, ΩP<0.05 LPS + Verb vs. LPS and Verb,
  ΨP<0.05 TNF + Verb vs. TNF and Verb, ΦP<0.05 TNF + Verb vs. Verb. (C) R-K562 cells
  were treated for 48 h. *P<0.05 R-562 untreated control cells vs. all other groups,
  αP<0.05 Verb vs. IM + Verb, Das + Verb, LPS + Verb and TNF + Verb, βP<0.05 Das vs.
  Das + Verb (n=5). IM, imatinib; Das, dasatinib; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TNF, tumor
  necrosis factor α; Verb, verbascoside.
