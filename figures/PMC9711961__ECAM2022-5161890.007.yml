caption: PF inhibits the activation of the downstream NF-κB signaling pathway in vivo.
  (a) Expressions of NF-κB mRNA in mice were determined by real-time PCR. (b) The
  protein bands of IKKα/β, p-IKKα/β, IκBα, p-IκBα, NF-κB, and p-NF-κB. (c) Quantitative
  analysis of protein expression alteration in spleens and kidneys of MRL/lpr were
  showed. MRL/MP mice treated with distilled water were used as the control group,
  and MRL/lpr mice treated with distilled water were used as the model group. The
  therapeutic concentration of PF was 50 mg/kg. The results were shown as mean ± S.D
  (n = 3). ∗ and ∗∗ indicated significant differences at the levels of p < 0.05 and
  p < 0.01.
