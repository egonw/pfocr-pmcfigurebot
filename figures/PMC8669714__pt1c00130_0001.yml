caption: Schematic of the cell death pathways. The extrinsic apoptosis pathway is
  set in motion by the TNF ligands (e.g., TNF, TRAIL, FasL) binding to the TNF receptor
  superfamily, which recruits TRADD and FADD to form the DISC complex and activates
  caspase-8. Caspase-8 activation is regulated by TRAF1/2, cIAP1, cIAP2 and c-FLIP.
  The Bcl-2 family of proteins regulates the intrinsic pathway. The Bcl-2 family of
  proteins include BH3-only proteins, BIM, BID, BIK, NOXA, and PUMA (purple); prosurvival
  proteins, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl (yellow); and prodeath proteins, BAX and BAK (dark blue).
  Activation of the intrinsic pathway results in the formation of BAX/BAK channels
  and MOMP, resulting in the release of cyto c (green) and SMAC (red) from the mitochondria.
  Cytosolic cyto c forms the apoptosome complex with APAF1 and pro-caspase-9, activating
  caspase-9. Caspase-8 can amplify the intrinsic pathway by cleaving BID into tBID.
  As illustrated, IAP proteins (light blue) and SMAC also regulate apoptosis. Initiator
  caspases activate the executioner caspases-3, -6, and -7, which carry out apoptosis.
  The TNF receptors can also activate the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway and recruit RIPK1
  and RIPK3 to activate mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) and implement the
  necroptosis pathway in a caspase-independent manner.
