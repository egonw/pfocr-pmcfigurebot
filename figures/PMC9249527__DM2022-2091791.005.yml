caption: DEGs and GSEA enrichment analysis of FABP7. (a) Volcano plot of DEGs with
  log2 − fold change (log2FC) > 1 were shown in red; DEGs with (log2FC) < −1 were
  shown in green (p < 0.05). (b) Heatmap of the top 15 genes positively and negatively
  associated with FABP7. (c) Heatmap of enriched terms across DEGs in Metascape analysis.
  (d) Enrichment plot of the angiogenesis pathway from GSEA.
