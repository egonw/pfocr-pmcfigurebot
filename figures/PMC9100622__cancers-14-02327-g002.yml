caption: EWSR1-FLI1 and EGR2 regulate the protein expression of the mevalonate pathway
  in Ewing cells. (A,B) Western blot analysis of HMGCS1, HMGCR, MVK, and MVD expression
  in total lysates of the A673, SKNMC, TC71, and POE Ewing cell lines transfected
  with a control siRNA (siCTRL) or with siRNA targeting EWSR1-FLI1 (siEF1) (A) or
  EGR2 (siEGR2#1) (B) for 72 h. The A673/TR/shEF1 inducible cellular model was treated
  with doxycycline for 7 days (+Dox) to invalidate the EWSR1-FLI1 expression or was
  untreated (−Dox). (C) Quantification of protein expression levels of EWSR1-FlI1,
  EGR2, HMGS1, HMGCR, MVK, and MVD after invalidation by siRNA of EWSR1-FLI1 (siEF1)
  or EGR2 (siEGR2#1) for 72 h; the graph represents the relative expression to siCTRL
  for each cell line. The histograms correspond to the mean value of all Ewing cell
  lines (n = 4). Data are presented as mean +/− SD. **** p value < 0.0001, *** p value
  < 0.001, ** p value < 0.01, * p value < 0.05 versus siCTRL.
