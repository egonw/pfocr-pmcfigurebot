caption: 'H&E staining and TUNEL staining in the ischemic penumbra on the 7th day
  after MCAO. (a) Histopathological examination results of neurons in cerebral peri-infarct
  cortex of rats in each group (n = 3). The black arrows indicate typical changes.
  (b) TUNEL staining showed neuronal apoptosis in all groups. Nuclei were stained
  with DAPI (blue), and the colocalization of blue and green indicates TUNEL-positive
  cells. Scale bars = 40 μm; magnification: 400×. (c) Quantitative analysis of neuronal
  apoptosis. Data are presented as the mean ± SD (n = 4); ∗P < 0.05 versus the sham
  group; #P < 0.05 versus the I/R group; &P < 0.05 versus the 2ME2 group.'
