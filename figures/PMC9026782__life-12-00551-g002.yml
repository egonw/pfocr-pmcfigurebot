caption: miR-138 is the upstream acting factor of APT1. (A), miR-138 expression level
  in HUVEC; (B), miR-138 expression level in aorta; (C), The expression level of miR-138;
  (D), the RNA expression level of APT1; (E), the protein expression level of APT1;
  (F), target relationship between miR-138 and APT1; (G), dual fluorescence reporter
  vector assay for APT1 and miR-138 direct target relationship. The results are shown
  by mean Â± standard deviation; the above experiments are repeated three times; *
  represents p < 0.05.
