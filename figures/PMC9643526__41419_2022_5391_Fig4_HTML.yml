figure_title: FMR1 promotes the progression of CRC by upregulating EGFR
caption: a GSEA plot showed that high expression of FMR1 was positively correlated
  with the ERBB and its downstream signaling pathway in published CRC patient gene
  expression profiles (NCBI/GEO/GSE17538 and GSE21815). b Western blot was used to
  test the molecular markers of ERBB and its downstream pathway. c Western blot was
  used to validate the CRC cells with EGFR stably knockdown. d CRC cell proliferation
  was analyzed by CCK8 assays. e The results of colony formation; the numbers of colonies
  containing >50 cells were scored. The number of colonies counted was of an entire
  well and the error bars represent mean ± SD from three independent experiments.
  f The results of transwell assays. The bar chart represents the migration cell numbers.
  Error bars represent the means ± SD of 3 different fields. g The results of wound
  healing assays. The bar chart represents the migration distance. Error bars represent
  the means ± SD of 3 different fields. h The xenograft models were generated after
  injecting Vector, FMR1 and FMR1/shEGFR cells in nude mice (n = 6/group). i The tumor
  volumes were measured on the indicated days. The data points represent the mean
  tumor volumes ± SD. j The tumor weight was measured after the nude mice were euthanized.
  Error bars represent the means ± SD. k The sections of tumor were subjected to H&E
  staining or IHC staining using an antibody against Ki-67. l Representative gross
  images of the orthotopic mouse metastatic model from different experimental groups
  are shown. Sections of the liver were stained with H&E. m The statistical analysis
  of number of liver metastatic nodules. Error bars represent the means ± SD. n The
  statistical distribution of metastasis numbers. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.
