caption: The main effects and mechanisms of curcumin on cancers. (1) Curcumin could
  suppress proliferation by attenuating cell cycle via inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin pathway,
  increasing the levels of p53, p21 and p27, and then inhibiting the levels of CDK4
  and Cyclin D1. (2) Curcumin could enhance the levels of E-cadherin and decrease
  the levels of N-cadherin, vimentin, fibronectin, slug and snail through suppressing
  TGF-β/Smad2/3 pathway, ultimately inhibiting migration and invasion. (3) Curcumin
  could stimulate ROS production by activating p38 MAPK, JNK and ERK pathways. (4)
  Curcumin could trigger ferroptosis, and increase the levels of TFRC, FTL and FTH1.
  (5) Curcumin could promote apoptosis by enhancing the expression of apoptotic proteins
  (Bax, Cleaved-caspase-3, Cleaved-caspase-9 and Cleaved-PARP), and inhibiting the
  expression of anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2). (6) Curcumin could enhance the expressions
  of Beclin1, Atg5, Atg3 and LC3B-II/I to promote autophagy by PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.
  (7) Curcumin could reduce the levels of Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog to suppress stemness
  through inhibiting JAK/STAT3 pathways. (8) Curcumin could suppress TLR4/NF-κB signaling
  pathway to attenuate inflammation (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β). (9) Curcumin could attenuate
  angiogenesis by inhibiting the expressions of VEGF, CD31, αSMC, iNOS and COX-2.
  (10) Curcumin could regulate gut microbiota by reducing the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes.
