caption: 'NT5DC2 regulates the p53 signaling pathway. The expression levels of p53
  signaling pathway-associated proteins were analyzed by western blotting. *P<0.05,
  **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs. shRNA-NC; #P<0.05 and ##P<0.01 vs. shRNA-NT5DC2 + Oe-NC.
  NT5DC2, 5′-nucleotidase domain-containing 2; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; NC, negative
  control; oe, overexpression.'
article_title: Decreased RNA-binding protein IGF2BP2 downregulates NT5DC2, which suppresses
  cell proliferation, and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in diffuse large
  B-cell lymphoma cells by regulating the p53 signaling pathway.
