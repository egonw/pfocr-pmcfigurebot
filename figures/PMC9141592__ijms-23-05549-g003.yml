caption: The transcriptomic profiling of normal and keloid fibroblasts, showing the
  inhibitory effect of ASC-J9 on inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis. (A)
  Transcriptomic profiling of NFs (n = 1) and KFs (n = 1) treated with DMSO or 10
  Î¼M ASC-J9 for 24 h was performed by RNA sequencing. Canonical pathways were analyzed
  by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) following identification of DEGs. (B) Cluster
  methods were carried out by the tidyverse package to explore gene expression patterns.
  The gene ontology biological processes of DEGs in each cluster were analyzed by
  the clusterProfiler package. DEGs, differentially expressed genes; NFs, normal fibroblasts;
  KFs, keloid fibroblasts.
