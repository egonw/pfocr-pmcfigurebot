caption: Loss of DDRGK1 in ATDC5 cells led to impaired chondrogenesis with apoptosis
  and ER stress signaling pathway involvement. (A) Ratio of mRNA level change in NC
  and KO ATDC5 chondrocytes in a volcano plot (3 pairs of biological replicates).
  (B) KEGG pathway analyses of differentially expressed mRNAs in the NC and KO ATDC5
  chondrocytes shown in panel (A). (C) Heatmap showing the mRNAs of interest in the
  NC and KO ATDC5 chondrocytes shown in panel (A). (D) Gene set enrichment analysis
  (GSEA) of ER stress pathways in the NC and KO ATDC5 chondrocytes shown in panel
  (A). (E) Alcian blue staining of NC and KO ATDC5 chondrocytes after 9 days of high-density
  culture in chondrogenesis medium with or without thapsigargin (Tg) (6.25 nM). (F)
  Quantification of the integrated optical density /area ratio in the Alcian blue-stained
  cells shown in panel (E). Cell morphology of NC and KO ATDC5 chondrocytes with or
  without Tg (6.25 nM) treatment. (G) Western blot analysis of Bax, Bcl2, cleaved
  and full-length Caspase 3, cleaved and full-length PARP, DDRGK1 and β-actin expression
  in NC and KO ATDC5 chondrocytes with or without Tg (6.25 nM) treatment. (H) Cell
  morphology, flow cytometry and Hoechst staining of NC and KO ATDC5 chondrocytes
  treated with or without Tg (6.25 nM) for 24 h. Karyopyknosis of the cell nucleus
  was observed using Hoechst staining. (I) Quantification of the apoptosis rate (Q2
  + Q3) based on flow cytometry of the cells shown in panel (H). (J) Western blot
  analysis of ATF-4, eIF2α, phospho-eIF2α and XBP-1s control in NC and KO ATDC5 chondrocytes
  treated with Tg for 24 h using β-actin as the loading control. (K) Quantification
  of karyopyknosis cells based on the number of cells with shrunken nuclei and the
  total number of cells with normal nuclei shown in panel (H) after Hoechst staining.
  All data are presented as the mean ± SD from three or more experiments. *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 and ****P < 0.0001.
