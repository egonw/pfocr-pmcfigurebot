caption: 'Gradual cooling to 25 °C significantly dephosphorylates Akt and ERK1/2 and
  phosphorylates p70S6K. (A) Real-time temperature measurement of the cells incubated
  at 25 °C (N = 6). Representative immunoblotting image of (B) C2C12 cells, (C) HepG2
  cells, and (D) Fao cells. Cells were starved for 24 h and were incubated at 25 °C
  for up to 60 min. Insulin stimulation: 50 nM, 10 min. Quantification of the phosphorylation
  change (Left, C2C12 cells; Middle, HepG2 cells; Right, Fao cells) was performed
  on (E) IRS1, (F) pAkt(S473), (G) GSK3β, (H) p70S6K, (I) FoxO1, and (J) ERK1/2. Columns
  are mean ± 95% confidence interval (N = 3 independent experiment). Results were
  normalized by β-actin (* p = 0.0021; ** p = 0.0002; *** p < 0.001; One-way ANOVA;
  Dunnett’s test compared to negative control).'
