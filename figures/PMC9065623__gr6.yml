caption: Myricetin inhibits tumor growth in the in vivoconditions. NudeBALB/c mice
  bearing the adenocarcinoma gastric cell line (AGS) as a xenograft were treated with
  myricetin (25 mg/kg) for 28 days, following which, the (A) tumor volume, (B) tumor
  weight, and (C) body weight were measured. The body weight of mice was measured
  every 3 days. Data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean. (D) Histological
  observations of myricetin-treated nude mice. The microscopic analysis of liver and
  kidney specimens do not show any evidence of adverse systemic toxicity following
  myricetin treatment. Slides were observed under a microscope (scale bar, 10 μm).
  Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD); ∗p < 0.05 vs. control group.
