caption: Single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐Seq) characterizes distinct Nicotiana attenuata
  corolla cell types. (a) Corolla limbs and throat cups were sampled from 40 N. attenuata
  flowers at each Zeitgeber Time (ZT), and scRNA‐Seq libraries were generated. The
  total experimental procedures were finished within 2 h to reduce the effect of protoplasting.
  (b) A uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) plot of the 3756 cells
  classified into five major cell types, composed of a total of 10 distinct clusters.
  The number of cells of each cluster is given next to clusters. (c) UMAP plot showing
  dimensional reduction of the distribution of 3756 corolla cells from three scRNA‐Seq
  libraries. (d) Most biosynthetic genes of cuticular wax and cutin are highly enriched
  in clusters 0, 3, 4, 5, and 9. These genes are known to be expressed in the epidermis.
  CER4/FAR3, ECERIFERUM4/fatty acid reductase 3; CUS, cutin synthase‐like; GPAT6,
  glycerol‐3‐phosphate acyltransferase 6; KCS, 3‐ketoacyl‐CoA synthase; LACS1/2, long‐chain
  acyl‐CoA synthase 1/2; LTP, lipid‐transfer proteins; NLTP, nonspecific lipid‐transfer
  proteins; VLCFA, very‐long‐chain fatty acids; WSD1, wax ester synthase/diacylglycerol
  acyltransferase 1. (e) Genes associated with photosynthesis are highly expressed
  in cluster 6 at all time points and in clusters 1, 2, and 6 at ZT 8. Photosynthetic
  genes have been reported to be expressed specifically in the inner layer cells,
  like mesophyll or parenchymal cells (Langdale & Nelson, ; Stockhaus et al., ).
