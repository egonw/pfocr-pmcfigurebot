caption: Sustainable glycerol 3-phosphate synthesis fueled by enzymatic ATP recycling.
  (A) Schematic of sustainable enzymatic network with recycling of metabolic energy
  and product formation. We envision a selectively open system where macromolecules
  are retained, while reactants are exchanged with the external medium either by membrane
  proteins (impermeable solutes) or by passive diffusion (permeable solutes) to maintain
  the system out of equilibrium for a prolonged period of time. Substrates are fed
  from the external medium (purple), while end-products are either recycled internally
  (cofactors) or exported (waste products) (green). The system ultimately reaches
  equilibrium if the external medium is not refreshed or infinitely large in volume,
  as is the case with vesicles in a test tube. (B) Schematic of enzymatic network
  for sustainable glycerol 3-phosphate synthesis, fueled by ATP generation and recycling
  via l-arginine breakdown. The arginine breakdown pathway is composed of an l-arginine/l-ornithine
  antiporter (ArcD2) and three cytosolic proteins (ArcA, ArcB, and ArcC1). In this
  system, l-arginine is imported from the external medium and used to phosphorylate
  ADP. The end-product l-ornithine is exported in exchange for l-arginine. Other end-products
  (CO2 and NH3) leave the vesicles passively according to their concentration gradient
  across the membrane bilayer. The vesicles carry the ionophores valinomycin and nigericin
  to dissipate any gradient of H+ and K+ or the possible formation of a membrane potential.
