caption: ARS promotes angiogenesis through an unfolded protein response pathwayDefects
  in TARS and IARS lead to endoplasmic reticulum stress and activate the unfolded
  protein response pathway. The unfolded protein response genes ATF4, ATF6, X-box
  protein 1 (XBP1), and VEGFA were upregulated in TARSy58 and IARSy68 mutants.
