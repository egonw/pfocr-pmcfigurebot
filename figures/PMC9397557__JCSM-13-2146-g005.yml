caption: 'Molecular pathways were unfavourably altered in the muscle of early KPC
  male mice but fewer changes occurred in females. PDAC increased (A) protein ubiquitination
  and (B) phosphorylation of the cytokine‐activated transcription factor STAT3 with
  greater effect on males than females. **P < 0.01. (C) Quadriceps muscles were subjected
  to total RNA sequencing, and the data are expressed as fold change of KPC vs. control
  or differentially expressed genes (DEG). Cut‐off for DEG identification: linear
  fold change |FC| > 2; P < 0.05. There are more dysregulated genes in male KPC mice
  than female KPC mice at early stage with few overlapping DEGs. (D) PDAC increased
  the muscle‐specific E3 ligase genes Fbxo32/Atrogin1 and Trim63/MuRF1 in males but
  not in females. *P < 0.05. (E) Comparison of enriched pathways between male KPC
  vs. male no‐tumour control or female KPC vs. female no‐tumour control. Each row
  represents a pathway with blue rectangle indicating inhibition and orange indicating
  activation determined by |Z| ≥ 2 and P < 0.05. Dots, |Z| < 2. The pathways were
  sorted based on the male KPC vs. control; the most inhibited pathway is on the top
  and most activated one on the bottom in this group. All dysregulated pathways were
  inhibited in male KPC mice while fewer changes were seen in females. (F) RNAseq
  showed greater overlap between male and female DEGs in late‐stage PDAC cachexia.'
