caption: ASCVD-associated metabolite and protein alterations in the sera of HoFH patients.
  a Dot histogram of metabolite levels in HoFH patients with and without ASCVD events (concentration,
  nmol/mL). Mann–Whitney U test were used for each comparison. b Functionally grouped
  network of enriched pathways of differentiated proteins in patients with ASCVD events.
  c Enriched GO categories of differentiated proteins. BP biological process, CC cellular
  component, MP molecular function. d Topology analysis of pathway enrichment and
  impact from the joint pathway of differentially expressed proteins and metabolites.
  e Metabolite-protein interaction network. f Topology analysis of pathway enrichment
  and impact from the joint-pathway of differentially expressed proteins and metabolites.
