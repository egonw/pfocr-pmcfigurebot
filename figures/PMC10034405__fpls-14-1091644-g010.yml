caption: 'Diagrammatic representation of involvement of GIGENTEA, jasmonic acid, and
  salicylic acid pathway genes for eliciting pathogen response to F. oxysporum infection
  in Arabidopsis thaliana. (A) Under uninfected condition, jasmonic and salicylic
  acid levels and GI are at endogenous levels. The levels of ICS1 are low due to its
  inhibition. The dimerized form of NPR1 is unable to move into the nucleus and bind
  to any TF for defense response. Similarly, the JA pathway is also uninduced. (B)
  Salicylic acid pathway: When F. oxysporum infects wild-type Col-0 plants, increased
  GIGANTEA (GI) accumulation results in GI binding to PAD4, followed by increased
  SA accumulation. However, when infected, NPR1 is unable to bind to the transcription
  factor TGA2, limiting the expression of defense-related genes, i.e., PR1. (D) In
  the absence of GI, the SA pathway is reversed upon F. oxysporum infection, making
  the plant more resistant to the disease. (C) Jasmonic acid pathway: Increased GI
  expression and accumulation, on the other hand, results in less JA-ile in Col-0
  (active form). Subsequently, there is a reduction in the transcript level of COI1,
  which does not bind to JA-ile and thus cannot form a complex with JAZs. JAZs functions
  as a repressor, inhibiting PDF 1.2. This eventually makes the plant vulnerable to
  Fusarium infection. (E) On the contrary, in the absence of GI, the accumulation
  of JA-ile is high and it provides resistance to the plant upon F. oxysporum infection.'
