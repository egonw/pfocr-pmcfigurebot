figure_title: Up-regulated genes and pathways during memory formation
caption: 'a Expanded reactome analysis (String database, STRING-db.org) outlining
  individual functional clusters of up-regulated genes enriched in inflammation, cytokine
  release, and cell cycle/DNA repair pathways. b Gene ontology analysis showing enrichment
  of Tlr signaling. c Up-regulation of the Tlr9 pathway replicated in a separate set
  of hippocampi collected 96 h or 28 days after CFC with qPCR microarrays customized
  for immune response genes. d qPCR comparing the level of selected Tlr (Tlr7, Tlr9,
  and Tlr13) obtained 24, 48, or 96 h after CFC relative to naïve samples showing
  significant up-regulation of Tlr9 (n = 5 mice/group; one way ANOVA Tlr7: p = 0.6677,
  F(3,16) = 0.5306; Tlr9: p = 0.0317, F(3,16) = 3.783; Tlr13: p = 0.5903, F(3,16) = 0.6569).
  Data represented as mean ± s.e.m., nsp > 0.05; ****p < 0.0001; ***p < 0.001; **p < 0.01;
  *p < 0.05.'
