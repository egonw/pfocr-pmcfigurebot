caption: Dexrazoxane decreases SDCBP activity and downstream signaling. (A) KYSE450
  and KYSE30 cells were treated with different concentrations of dexrazoxane. Lysates
  from KYSE450 and KYSE30 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFR and then immunoblotted
  with the indicated antibodies. (B) After transfecting HEK293T cells with EGFR and
  overexpressing SDCBP the plasmid, the lysates were immunoprecipitated using either
  anti-Flag or anti-HA and subsequently subjected to immunoblotting using the designated
  antibodies. (C) KYSE450 and KYSE30 cells were treated with different concentrations
  of dexrazoxane. Lysates were subjected to Western blotting to detect EGFR/PI3K/Akt
  pathway proteins. (D) KYSE450 and KYSE30 cells were treated with dexrazoxane, and
  EGFR localization was evaluated through an immunofluorescence assay. Cropped images
  and uncropped blots are displayed in Supplementary Figs. â€“.
