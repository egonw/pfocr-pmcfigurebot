caption: CRTC2 regulates the expression of cystogenesis‐associated genes in human
  ADPKD cells. a) Heatmap of gene expression in WT 9–12 cells transfected with sgControl
  or sgCRTC2. Rows show the Z scores calculated for each group. b) Volcano plots showing
  differentially expressed genes. c) Gene set enrichment analysis displaying CRTC2‐binding
  gene set enriched for genes downregulated in sgCRTC2 cells. NES, normalized enrichment
  score. d) Venn diagram showing the overlap of sgCRTC2 downregulated genes and CRTC2‐binding
  genes, referred to as CRTC2‐target genes. e) GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses
  of CRTC2‐target genes. f) Heatmap of expression values of genes enriched in the
  indicated processes. Rows show the Z scores calculated for each group. g) RT‐qPCR
  analysis of mRNA levels of representative CRTC2‐target genes in kidneys from the
  indicated mouse groups. Data are presented as means ± SEM. The unpaired Student's
  two‐sided t‐test was used for statistical analysis. ****p < 0.0001. These results
  are from three independent experiments.
