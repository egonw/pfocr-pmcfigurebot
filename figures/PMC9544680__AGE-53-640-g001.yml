caption: The current model for the interferon response pathway of the chicken. Type
  I, II and III interferon molecules act as cytokines in a paracrine and autocrine
  fashion by interacting with the IFNAR1:IFNAR2, IFNGR1:IFNGR2 and IFNLR1:IL‐10Rβ
  dimeric receptor complexes respectively. Upon receptor binding, the Janus kinase
  (JAK) signal transducer and activation of transcription (STAT) pathway is activated,
  whereby phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 causes them to dimerise. In mammals this
  dimer then goes on to form the complex interferon stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3
  – in mammals this complex forms via interactions with IRF9, however a chicken orthologue
  of this protein has yet to be identified). The ISGF3 complex can then enter the
  nucleus and bind to interferon stimulated response element sequences, resulting
  in the upregulation of hundreds of ISGs and a specific antiviral state. In the case
  of the type II system, STAT1 and STAT2 form a homodimer that can then enter the
  nucleus and bind to gamma‐activated sequences, resulting in upregulation of specific
  ISGs (Andreakos et al., ; Santhakumar et al., ). This image was created using modified
