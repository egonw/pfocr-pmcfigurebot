figure_title: Gruffi identifies stressed cells in retinal organoids
caption: 'A UMAP showing CCA integrated and re‐clustered datasets as in analysis of
  fig 6 in Sridhar et al () and colored based on annotation provided by the authors.B
  UMAP color coded for datasets: two fetal (125 days central and periphery) and one
  organoid dataset (205 days).C Bar plot with downsampled contribution per cluster.
  There are three clusters mostly consisting of retinal organoid cells.D GO‐term scores
  as used previously in Gruffi. Note that glycolysis is very high in RGCs, a cell
  type known to be very metabolically active. Additionally, a score for RGCs is shown
  consisting of the marker genes: ISL1, SNCG, RBPMS.E scWGCNA analysis on retinal
  data identifies one module (blue module) that is enriched in organoid cells.F, G
  GSEA of blue module from scWGCNA reveals enrichment of hypoxia related terms in
  this module.H The GO‐term “cellular response to hypoxia” (GO:0071456) marks specific
  populations in the dataset and will be used in the stress annotation.I Gruffi stress
  identification using response to hypoxia and to ER stress as selecting terms, as
  well as gliogenesis and the RGC score as negative filters. Color code shows stressed
  cells and UMAP depicts each different dataset.J The three clusters that were biased
  toward organoid cells in (C) show strong enrichment in stressed cells, whereas other
  clusters have generally low percentages (left). Similarly, the organoid dataset
  shows about 33% of stressed cells, while in fetal there are almost none (right).K
  Per granule score of GO‐terms with response to hypoxia on the x‐axis and response
  to ER stress on the y axis shows that stress scores are generally low in fetal but
  increased in organoids. The size depicts the number of cells that are within the
  respective granule.L PROGENy pathway activity score for the clusters as shown in
  L reveals that Hypoxia is uniquely enriched in stressed cells. Note that miG is
  a remnant of prior cell‐type annotation and contains just 36 cells. It is therefore
  to be regarded as an unrepresentative leftover population.M, N After stress filtering
  the datasets are re integrated and all downstream visualizations are re‐computed.'
