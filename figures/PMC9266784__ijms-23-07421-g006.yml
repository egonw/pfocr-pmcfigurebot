caption: The key differential metabolites of the HT_6 group were mapped to metabolic
  pathways to analysis, and the results of the metabolic pathway analysis are shown
  in the bubble chart. (A) represents HT_6 vs. ck groups, (B) represents HT_6 vs.
  LT_6 groups. Each bubble in the bubble diagram represented a metabolic pathway.
  The abscissa of the bubble and the size of the bubble represent the size of the
  pathway influencing factor in the topology analysis. The larger the scale, the greater
  the influencing factors. The ordinate where the bubble is located and the color
  of the bubble represented the p value of the enrichment analysis (taking the negative
  natural logarithm, −ln(p), the darker the color, the smaller the p value, and the
  more significant the enrichment).
