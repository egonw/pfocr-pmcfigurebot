caption: Glioma development and NOTCH signalling pathway in vivo were suppressed after
  silencing of lncRNA FOXD2‐AS1 via TAF‐1. Nude mice were injected with GSCs expressing
  sh‐NC, sh‐lncRNA FOXD2‐AS1, oe‐NC, oe‐lncRNA FOXD2‐AS1 or oe‐lncRNA FOXD2‐AS1 +
  sh‐TAF‐1. A, LncRNA FOXD2‐AS1 and TAF‐1 expression in nude mice determined by RT‐qPCR.
  B, Tumour growth observed through the IVIS Lumina II Imaging System, n = 10. C,
  Survival of mice after different treatment. D, Tumour weight recorded on 15 days,
  n = 10. E, Western blot analysis of JAG1, PS1 and HES1 expression in mice. F, GSC
  apoptosis in nude mice determined using flow cytometry. * p < 0.05. Measurement
  data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Differences among multiple groups
  were analysed by one‐way ANOVA, followed by a Tukey multiple comparisons post‐test.
  Tumour volume among multiple groups at different time points was analysed using
  repeated measures ANOVA. Cell experiments were repeated in triplicate.
