caption: The Flow Chart of mogrosides biosynthetic pathway in Siraitia grosvenorii
  fruits. Mogrosides synthase genes which were transformed in this study are marked
  in blue, including SgSQE1, squalene epoxidases; SgCS, curbitadienol synthase; SgEPH2,
  epoxide hydrolases; SgP450, cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenase; SgUGT269-1 and SgUGT289-3,
  UDP-glucosyltransferases; The substrate, 2,3-oxidosqualene is shown with a yellow
  background. MI-A1, mogroside I-A1; MII-E, mogroside II-E; MIII, mogroside III; SI,
  siamenoside I; MV, mogroside V (in the dotted bordered rectangle).
