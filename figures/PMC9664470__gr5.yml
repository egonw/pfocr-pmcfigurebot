caption: Pancreatic stellate cells derived HGF suppressed the sensitivity of cancer
  cells to EGFR inhibitor through the re-activating PI3K-AKT pathway. a, The effect
  of CM on pancreatic cell lines treated with erlotinib or DMSO control. PI3K-AKT
  pathway activation was assessed by Western blot analysis after 24 h of treatment.
  b, Immunoblots showing the effect of Met kinase inhibition ± HGF on EGFR, Met, AKT,
  and ERK phosphorylation. Cells were co-treated with erlotinib. c, CCK-8 assay showing
  the relative cell proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells. Cells were co-treated
  with erlotinib ± HGF ± crizotinib. d, The effect of LY294002 on pancreatic cell
  lines treated with erlotinib or DMSO control, with or without HGF. PI3K-AKT pathway
  activation was assessed by Western blot analysis after 24 h of treatment. e, The
  cell viability of pancreatic cancer cell lines treated with the PI3K inhibitor.
  Cells were co-treated with erlotinib ± HGF. f, The apoptosis rates of PANC-1 and
  BxPC-3 cells, which were incubated with erlotinib ± HGF ± PI3K inhibitor and stained
  with Hoechst 33258. g, Cell apoptosis was measured by Western blot assay of PANC-1
  and BxPC-3 cells treated with erlotinib ± Met inhibitor ± PI3K inhibitor. Cells
  were co-treated with HGF. h, Cell viability was measured by CCK-8 assay of PANC-1
  and BxPC-3 cells treated with erlotinib ± Met inhibitor ± PI3K inhibitor. Cells
  were co-treated with HGF. i, Cell viability was determined after cells were transfected
  with the vehicle plasmid or the constitutively active AKT plasmid (CA-AKT) in the
  presence or absence of erlotinib and crizotinib. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
