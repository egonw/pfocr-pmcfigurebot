caption: Metformin activates the AMPK/NLRP3 signaling pathway in spinal cord neurons.
  (a–c) Representative Western blots and quantification data of the levels of p-AMPK
  and p-ACC in the spinal cord neurons from each group. All data represented the mean
  ± SD, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, n = 3. (d–h) Representative Western blots and quantification
  data of the expression of NLRP3, ASC, Caspase 1, and IL-1β in the spinal cord neurons
  from each group. All data represent the mean ± SD, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, n = 3. (i, j) Immunofluorescence
  examination was utilized to recognize the staining power of antibodies focusing
  on NeuN and p-AMPK. Scale bars represent 40 μm. ∗∗∗P < 0.001, n = 3.
