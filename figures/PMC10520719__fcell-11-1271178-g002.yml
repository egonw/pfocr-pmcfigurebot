caption: Adam11 Knock down affects cranial neural crest cell migration. (A) Fluorescent
  tracking of CNC migration. Lineage tracer (MbC; Membrane Cherry) was injected at
  the 8-cell-stage in one dorsal animal blastomere, either alone (control) or with
  the morpholino to Adam11 (1.56 ng) or both MO11 and the Adam11L_R rescue mRNA (125 pg).
  The presence or absence of fluorescent neural crest on the lateral and ventral side
  of the embryo is scored only in embryos with proper targeting (Dorsal anterior quadrant).
  (B) Statistical analysis of the targeted injection. The percentage of embryos with
  fluorescent CNC in the migration pathway is represented (Y-axis) normalized to embryos
  injected with Membrane Cherry alone (100%). Individual dots, squares and triangles
  represent each biological replicates (4). Asterisks represent the p-value for ANOVA<
  0.05. (C) Schematic diagram of CNC grafting experiment. (D). Representative photographs
  of embryo grafted with fluorescent CNC explant at stage 18 and scored at stage 24
  for both control and MO11 injected embryos. (E) Statistical analysis of the grafting
  experiment (n is the number of grafted embryos). The histogram represents the number
  of branchial arches (BA) segments scored at stage 24. Each dot or triangle represents
  one embryo from five biological replicates (** = p < 0.01). (F) Representative example
  of Cranial neural crest cell explants on fibronectin. Photographs were taken during
  the initial phase of collective cell migration (5 h). (G) Statistical analysis of
  cellular migration showing the number of single cells per explant, the instantaneous
  velocity and the persistence of cell migration. Single cells were scored at 5 h.
  Each dot represents one explant. The instantaneous velocity was measured for 110
  single cells over (30 min). The persistence of migration was measured on the same
  cells by dividing the distance from the start and end position by the distance traveled.
  At least 3 biological replicates for each experiment. Student’s t-test was applied
  (**=p < 0.01, *=p < 0.05).
