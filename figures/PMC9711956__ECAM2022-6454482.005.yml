caption: 'Cordycepin suppresses tumor growth in the tumor xenograft model. (a) Observation
  of the tumor mass morphology of transplanted tumors in nude mice in various medication
  groups. Cultured cells were inoculated in nude mice at 1 × 107 cells/mL and randomly
  divided into groups after 10 days: PBS, 10 μg/mL cordycepin, 20 μg/mL cordycepin,
  10 μg/mL 5 FU, and 10 μg/mL cordycepin + 10 μg/mL 5 FU. Intraperitoneal injection
  was administered once a day, and the combination group was given drugs at daily
  intervals for 30 days. The tumor volume of nude mice was measured after 3 days.
  The statistical data showed tumor volume between different treatment groups. (b)
  18F-FDG micro-PET imaging and statistical analysis of tumors in different drug groups.
  Experimental data showed a glucose uptake in nude mouse tumor tissues in different
  groups and indirectly reflected the glucose metabolism level; the white arrow indicates
  the location of the xenograft tumor. (c) TUNEL staining (magnification ×200) of
  tumor tissues of tumor-bearing nude mice in different drug groups and statistical
  analysis. (d) IHC staining and statistical analysis of tumor tissues in HCC-LM3
  tumor-bearing nude mice and quantification of the expression of HK2, LDHA, and PKM2
  molecules. (e) Expression levels of HK2, PKM2, and LDHA proteins in tumor tissues
  of HCC-LM3 tumor-bearing nude mice. Data are expressed as mean ± SD. ∗P < 0.05;
  ∗∗P < 0.01; ∗∗∗P < 0.001 (vs. control group, n = 3).'
