figure_title: CXCL12 alters skeletal muscle cell differentiation
caption: (A and B) Gene set enrichment analysis of genes correlated with CXCL12 and
  CXCL16 in the RNA sequencing of skeletal muscle biopsies. The pathway “muscle cell
  migration” was positively enriched, while “skeletal muscle contraction” was negatively
  enriched. (C) Inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP production by CXCL12 or CXCL16
  (100 ng/ml) measured in C2C12 myotubes as described in Materials and Methods. Box-and-whisper
  plots from five independent experiments. *P < 0.05. (D) C2C12 myoblasts were exposed
  to CXCL12 or CXCL16 (100 ng/ml) every other day for 5 days during the differentiation
  process as described in Materials and Methods. mRNA expression of genes markers
  of myoblasts or myotubes was measured by qPCR. Data are means ± SE, n = 5 independent
  experiments, repeated-measures ANOVA with Tukey’s posttest comparing cytokines to
  vehicle, *P < 0.05. (E to G) Primary human skeletal muscle cells from individuals
  with type 2 diabetes (T2D) or NGT were exposed to CXCL12a/SDF-1α or CXCL12b/SDF-1β
  (100 ng/ml) during the differentiation process as described in Materials and Methods.
  mRNA expression of gene markers of myoblasts or myotubes were measured by qPCR.
  Data are means ± SE, n = 4/6 cultures from independent donors (NGT/T2D).
