figure_title: Schematic model of the role of OPTN on myogenesis during muscle regeneration
caption: OPTN physically interacts with and targets GSK3β for autophagic degradation
  and then promotes the nuclear translocation of β-catenin, resulting in activation
  of Wnt signaling pathway mediated myogenesis during muscle regeneration. APC, adenomatous
  polyposis coli protein; AXIN, axis inhibition protein; GSK3β, glycogen synthase
  kinase 3β; LEF/TCF, lymphoid enhancer factor/T-cell factor; LRP, low-density lipoprotein
  receptor related protein, OPTN, optineurin.
article_title: Optineurin promotes myogenesis during muscle regeneration in mice by
  autophagic degradation of GSK3β.
