caption: (a) Enrichment of differential metabolite KEGG pathway between H and CM-0
  groups; (b) Enrichment of differential metabolite KEGG pathway between CM-0 and
  CM-3 groups. The x-axis denotes the rich factor. The y-axis indicates the metabolic
  pathway. Bubble size means the number of metabolites in the pathway; bubble color
  means p-value; the darker the color (red), the smaller the p-value; the darker the
  color (black), the higher the p-value. (c) Network metabolic map for differential
  metabolites. The altered pathways referred to pyrimidine metabolism, valine, leucine,
  and isoleucine biosynthesis, arginine biosynthesis, pantothenate, and CoA biosynthesis
  in cows with clinical mastitis; the targeted metabolic pathways in the CM cows treated
  with anemoside B4 mainly focused on glycerophospholipid metabolism, linoleic acid
  metabolism, and the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids (p < 0.05). H, healthy;
  CM, clinical mastitis; CM-0 is the day of diagnosis, CM-3 represents the three consecutive
  days of anemoside B4 treatment.
