caption: The anti-tumor effect of ISP-1 depended on ROS accumulation. (A) Changes
  in the morphology and cell numbers of H460 and A549 after indicated treatments as
  imaged by inverted microscope (magnification, 100×). (B) Viabilities of H460 and
  A549 cells after ISP-I (10μM, 48h) treatment with or without NAC (2 mM) were assessed
  by CCK-8 assay. *** p < 0.001.
