caption: Dopamine can be O‐methylated to 3‐methoxytyramine (3MT) by catechol O‐methyltransferase
  (COMT); this biotransformation attenuates the dopaminergic properties of dopamine.
  In this work, we identify that gut bacteria have the metabolic potential to counteract
  COMT's metabolism of dopamine by O‐demethylating 3MT. Gut bacteria have previously
  been characterized to synthesize dopamine by decarboxylating levodopa (L‐dopa) using
  tyrosine decarboxylase (TyrDC). Figure created with BioRender.com (agreement number
