caption: 'mTORC2 participates in MDA-MB-231 cell migration elicited by CaSR. (A) Rictor-knockdown
  MDA-MB-231 cells. To achieve Rictor knockdown, cells were infected with lentiviral
  Rictor-shRNA. Bars represent mean ± standard deviation (SD) of Rictor expression
  (normalized to actin expression), ****p < 0.0001; (unpaired Student t test; n = 3).
  Anti-actin immunoblot served as loading control. (B) Effect of CaSR on Rac activation
  in control and Rictor-knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells. Control and Rictor-knockdown cells
  were stimulated for 10 min with R568 + calcium, and active Rac (Rac GTP) was isolated
  from cell lysates with GST-PAK-CRIB beads and revealed by western blot. Bars represent
  mean ± SD, ***p = 0.0009, ##p = 0.0091; (unpaired Student t test; n = 3). (C) Effect
  of Rictor-knockdown on CaSR-dependent MDA-MB-231 cell migration. Serum-starved Rictor-knockdown
  or control MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were stimulated with 2 mM calcium + 1 µM
  R568 ( +) for 6 h, or left in 0.25 mM calcium (-), EGF was used as control. Cell
  migration was tested in Boyden chambers. A representative filter is shown. Bars
  represent mean ± SD, **p = 0.005; (one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey; n = 3). (D)
  Effect of Rictor-knockdown on MDA-MB-231 cell migration in scratch assays. Wound-closure
  experiments were carried out with Rictor-knockdown and control MDA-MB-231 cells
  stimulated for 24 h with 2 mM calcium + 1 µM R568. Bars indicate mean ± SD, *p < 0.05, #p < 0.05;
  (one-way ANOVA followed Tukey’s; n = 3). (E) Model depicting how CaSR drives cell
  migration via the Gβγ/PI3K/AKT/mTORC2/Rac signaling pathway'
