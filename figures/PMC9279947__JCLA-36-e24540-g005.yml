caption: circ_0008726 was highly expressed in the tissues and blood of PE. (A) qRT‐PCR
  was employed to examine the expression of circ_0008726 in the placenta of PE patients
  and normal pregnant women, N = 3. (B) qRT‐PCR was used to detect the expression
  of circ_0008726 in the blood samples of PE patients and normal pregnant women, N = 17.
  (C) circ_0008726 is formed by back‐splicing of exons 4, 5, and 6 of gene DNAJB6.
  (D) qRT‐PCR was used to determine the knockdown efficiency of circ_0008726 in HTR‐8/SVneo
  cells. (E) qRT‐PCR was used to analyze the overexpression efficiency of circ_0008726
  in HTR‐8/SVneo cells. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
article_title: Hsa_circ_0008726 regulates the proliferation, migration, and invasion
  of trophoblast cells in preeclampsia through modulating the miR‐1290‐LHX6 signaling
  pathway.
