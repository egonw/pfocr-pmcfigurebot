figure_title: '– Cardiotoxicity cascade – Cardiotoxic injury triggers series of metabolic
  alterations in response to the oxidative stress, it is detectable by 18F-FDG PET/CT.
  The sustained injury and the failure of the myocyte self-healing contribute to cell
  dysfunction and mechanic alterations detected by strain rate imaging. Furthermore,
  the process continues with a decrease in the cardiac overall performance assessed
  by the LVEF. Signs of heart failure are then noticeable, suggesting that the heart
  no longer meet the body’s demands, or do it at the expense of high ventricular filling
  pressures (ROS: reactive oxygen species; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; PPP: pentose
  phosphate pathway; H6PD: hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; FDG: 18F-fluorodeoxy-glucose;
  LVEF: Left Ventricle Ejection Fraction)'
