figure_title: Hydrostatic pressure promotes clathrin‐dependent internalization
caption: Confocal IF images labelled with Hoechst (Blue) and internalized transferrin
  (Trf, red). Cells were allowed to internalize for 10 min, fixed and acid stripped
  to remove surface bound Trf. Hydrostatic pressure (H.P.) promotes transferrin uptake
  in WT and LATS1/2 DKO cells. Scale bar = 20 μm.Quantification of transferrin uptake
  in WT, Y/T DKO and LATS1/2 DKO cells treated with hydrostatic pressure compared
  to steady state. Each dot represents a single cell and error bars represent mean ± 95%
  CI. Data from four independent experiments. Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s post‐hoc.
  Steady‐state statistical analysis is shown in blue and transferrin uptake induced
  by pressure is shown in black. ***P < 0.001 (WT con vs. +H.P.), P = 0.2375 (Y/T
  DKO con vs. +H.P.), ***P < 0.001 (LATS1/2 DKO con vs. +H.P.), P = 0.2764 (WT con
  vs. Y/T DKO con), P = 0.0808 (WT con vs. LATS1/2 DKO con) and ***P = 0.0004 (Y/T
  DKO con vs. LATS1/2 DKO con).Confocal IF images of myc‐tagged AP180C (green) and
  non‐transfected cells showing internalized Trf (red) and stained with Hoechst (blue).
  AP180C inhibits transferrin uptake in WT and Y/T DKO cells. Scale bar = 20 μm. Examples
  of AP180C expressing cells indicated with arrows.Quantification of transferrin uptake
  in AP180C positive cells compared to vector control from images as in C. Each dot
  represents a single cell from four independent experiments and error bars represent
  mean ± 95% CI. Mann–Whitney U test. ***P < 0.001 (for both comparisons).Confocal
  IF images of HEK293A WT cells showing subcellular localization of YAP (red) in AP180C
  (green) negative and positive WT and LATS1/2 DKO cells. Cells also stained with
  Hoechst (blue). Examples of AP180C expressing cells indicated with arrows.Quantification
  of cytoplasmic‐to‐nuclear ratio of YAP in AP180C positive WT and LATS1/2 DKO cells
  compared to vector control from images as in E. Each dot represents a single cell
  pooled from four independent experiments. Error bars represent mean ± 95% CI. Mann–Whitney
  U test. ***P = 0.0008 (WT) and P = 0.9318 (LATS1/2 DKO).Cell response to hydrostatic
  pressure with AP180C‐mediated inhibition of clathrin‐dependent endocytosis. Each
  dot represents a single cell pooled from four independent experiments. Error bars
  represent mean ± 95% CI. Data pooled from four independent experiments. Kruskal–Wallis
  test with Dunn’s post‐hoc. ***P = 0.0005 (WT), P = 0.3930 (Y/T DKO) and P = 0.2929
  (LATS1/2 DKO).
