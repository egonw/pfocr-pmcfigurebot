caption: DA inhibits osteogenic differentiation and promotes adipogenic differentiation
  of rBMSCs. (a) ALP staining of rBMSCs treated with different concentrations of DA
  after 7 days of differentiation. Optical photos (upper photo) and microscopic images
  (lower photo). (b) ALP activity of rBMSCs treated with different concentrations
  of DA after 7 days of differentiation. (c) Calcium nodules assessed by Alizarin
  Red staining after 14-day osteogenic induction. Optical photos (upper photo) and
  microscopic images (lower photo). (d) Semiquantification of Alizarin Red staining.
  (e) The effect of DA on osteogenic-related mRNA expression in rBMSCs evaluated by
  qRT-PCR assay after 7 days of differentiation. (f, g) The expression levels of osteogenic-related
  proteins (COL1A1, ALP, RUNX2, OPN, and OCN) detected by western blot. (f) and quantified
  (g) in the indicated groups with 7-day osteogenic induction. (h) Oil Red “O” staining
  of rBMSCs treated with different concentrations of DA after 14-day adipogenic induction.
  (i) The effect of DA on adipogenic-related mRNA (Adipoq, Cebp, Fabp4, Pparr, and
  Plin1) expression in rBMSCs evaluated by qRT-PCR assay after 14-day adipogenic induction.
