figure_title: Canonical and non-canonical function of CD55
caption: (A) CD55 structure and its role in complement mediated pathway. (B) Non-complement
  role of CD55 signaling in cancer. CD55 can signal from outside in leading to activation
  of diverse oncogenic signaling pathways. Growth factors, cytokines, and prostaglandins
  augment or activate CD55 signaling. As a ligand for CD97, an epidermal growth factor
  seven-span transmembrane (EGF-7TM) receptor, CD55 can trigger intracellular signaling
  via Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT3) and
  GSK3Î². These pathways can activate cascades that drive oncogenesis via Myc, resistance
  to chemotherapy via BRCA1 and MLH1, and CSC self-renewal via SOX2, OCT4, and NANOG.
