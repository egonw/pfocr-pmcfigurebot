caption: PF‐06409577 promoted AMPK phosphorylation and down‐regulated the mTOR pathway
  in the MDCK model and in ADPKD mouse kidneys. (A) Representative western blot of
  signaling proteins in MDCK cells treated with vehicle or different concentrations
  of PF‐06409577 (1, 3 or 10 μm). (B) Representative western blot of signaling proteins
  in ADPKD mouse (Pkd1 flox/flox ;Ksp‐Cre) kidneys treated with vehicle or PF‐06409577
  (10 mg·kg−1·day−1), PF stands for PF‐06409577. (C) Densitometric quantification
  of p‐AMPK/AMPK expression. (D) Densitometric quantification of p‐p70S6K/p70S6K expression.
  (E) Densitometric quantification of p‐4EBP1/4EBP1 expression. (F) Densitometric
  quantification of p‐AKT/AKT expression. Data are presented as means ± SEM. N ≥ 3,
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 vs. Control (CON), ns, not significant, one‐way
  ANOVA followed by Tukey's analysis. (G) Densitometric quantification of p‐AMPK/AMPK
  expression in mouse kidneys from each group. (H) Densitometric quantification of
  p‐p70S6K/p70S6K expression in mouse kidneys from each group. (I) Densitometric quantification
  of p‐4EBP1/4EBP1 expression in mouse kidneys from each group. (J) Densitometric
  quantification of p‐AKT/AKT expression in mouse kidneys from each group. Data are
  presented as means ± SEM. Data are representative of three independent experiments,
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 vs. ADPKD, ns, not significant, Student's t‐test.
