caption: An overview of the biological effects of lithium. (A) Regenerative effects
  and their main signaling pathways that are activated in each tissue. Lithium can
  cause regeneration in several tissues, including bone, cartilage, dentin, nerve,
  skin, and vascular system. A WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway is the primary signaling
  pathway activated by lithium. Additionally, it has an anti-inflammatory response
  by inhibiting the GSK-3β pathway. (B) The anticancer effects of lithium in several
  types of prevalent cancers with a high mortality rate, including pancreatic cancer,
  thyroid cancer, esophageal cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer,
  breast cancer, lung cancer, leukemia, and glioblastoma. Lithium has shown an anticancer
  effect and has been used as a singular or adjunct treatment. Hence, lithium can
  be considered a chemosensitizer in chemotherapy. (C) Antibacterial properties. Lithium
  has antibacterial properties against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
  (D) Lithium has antireplicative effects against several types of viruses. (E) The
  crucial point of the biological properties of lithium, including its antiviral,
  anticancer, and regenerative effects, is the effect of lithium on autophagy.
