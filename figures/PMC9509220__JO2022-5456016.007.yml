caption: PDLIM1 influences the Hippo-YAP pathway. (a, b) RT-qPCR confirmed the profiles
  of YAP and its target genes in the cells. (c) Western blot verified the profiles
  of YAP and its target genes in the cells. (d) Western blot measured the abundance
  of YAP and phosphorylated YAP in the cell nucleus. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P <
  0.001 (vs. the NC group). N = 3.
