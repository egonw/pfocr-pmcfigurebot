caption: Schematic model showing the role played CES2 in regulating lipid homeostasis
  and OSCC progression. Generally, DGs are hydrolyzed to generate FAs and are generated
  to produce membrane phospholipids. CES2 enhances the hydrolysis of DGs to generate
  excessive FAs, inducing a marked increase in ROS levels and leading to mitochondrial
  damage; in addition, fewer DGs were available for phospholipid synthesis, reducing
  the signaling lipids available to activate the oncogenic PI3K/AKT/MYC signaling
  pathway and generate cellular membrane structures that repair damaged membrane,
  which inevitably leads to apoptosis. OSCC cells with decreased CES2 expression produce
  moderate amounts of FAs to promote cell growth and metastasis and prevent lipotoxicity.
