caption: Search for common and unique signaling pathways associated with DEGs at 24
  h after tMCAO in subcortical structures of the IH related to the sham-operated and
  contralateral controls. A pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs in two pairwise comparisons,
  i.e., IR-i vs. SO-r and IR-i vs. IR-c, was carried out according to DAVID (2021
  Update). (a) Schematic comparison of the KEGG PATHWAY (KP) annotations associated
  with the DEGs obtained in two pairwise comparisons, i.e., IR-i vs. SO-r and IR-i
  vs. IR-c, as assessed using a Venn diagram. The numbers on the diagram segments
  indicate the number of annotations. (b,c) The most significant signaling pathways
  and corresponding Padj-values, as well as the number of up- and downregulated DEGs
  that lay within the intersection on the Venn diagram (a) in IR-i vs. SO-r and (b)
  in IR-i vs. IR-c (c). (d,e) The most significant signaling pathways and corresponding
  Padj-values, as well as the number of up- and downregulated DEGs that lay outside
  of the intersection on the Venn diagrams (a) in IR-i vs. SO-r and (d) in IR-i vs.
  IR-c (e). DEGs and signaling pathways with Padj < 0.05 were exclusively selected
  for the analysis. Three animals were included in each comparison group.
