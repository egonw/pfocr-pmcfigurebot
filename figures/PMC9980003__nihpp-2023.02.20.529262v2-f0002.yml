caption: Examples of analysing multiple gene lists using PANGEA.A.) The prey proteins
  of multiple baits from AP mass-spec dataset () were submitted via the ‘Search Multiple’
  option at PANGEA. The gene sets of protein complex annotation from COMPLEAT were
  selected. The comparison of enrichment over annotated protein complexes from the
  interacting proteins of four different baits was illustrated using a heatmap. B.)
  RNAi screen data of signalling pathway studies were obtained from DRSC RNAi data
  repository () and the hits were submitted via the ‘Search Multiple’ option at PANGEA.
  The gene sets of FlyBase pathway annotation were used. The comparison of the enrichment
  of signalling pathway components from the screen hits of five studies was illustrated
  using a heatmap.
