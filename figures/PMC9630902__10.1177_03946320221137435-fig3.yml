caption: 'Effects of Lut/ZnO NPs on IRS, PI3K, PDK1, AKT, FoxO1 and G6Pase expression
  in hepatic tissues of NAFLD rat model. Quantitative western blotting analysis of
  IRS (a), PI3K (b), AKT (d), FoxO1 (e), and β-actin protein level. Western blotting
  of IRS, PI3K, AKT, FoxO1, and β-actin (f). Moreover, the gene expression of PDK1
  (c) and G6Pase (g) was represented. Values were expressed as Means ± SE (n = 6).
  a: denote significant change versus control, b: denote significant change versus
  Lut/ZnO NPs, c: denote significant change versus HFD and d: denote significant change
  versus HFD+STZ at p < 0.05.'
