caption: Ecological behaviour of CSCs, autophagy and entosis. (A) Programming TAM
  and CAF. Activation of ERK/STAT3 signaling molecules triggers M2 polarization of
  monocytes in breast tumours []. The recruitment of monocytes from the blood is carried
  out due to the production of chemokines—CCL2, CCL18, and cytokines CSF1, VEGF, etc.,
  by tumor cells. When polarizing monocytes in M2-TAM CSC, CSF1, HIF1a, TLR2, and
  other factors are used. []. CAF could promote monocyte recruitment toward cancer
  cells through CXCL12/CXCR4 pathway []. CAF produces MMPs that degrade the matrix
  and promote invasion of CSCs. CAFs produce IL17a which stimulates symmetric division
  of CSCs []. M2-TAMs produce IL4, 10, 13, TGFb, and PGE2, which act on CSCs and stimulate
  their symmetric division, increasing their population []. Thus, this type of relationship
  can be seen as a commensalism between TAM, CAF, and CSCs. The interaction between
  TAM and CSCs is described in detail in the overview []. (B) Heterotypic fusion.
  Heterotypic fusion cells expressed the tumour marker EpCam and macrophage markers
  CD163, CD68, CSFR1 and CD66b []. The hybrid cells display EMT with a significant
  downregulation of E-cad and upregulation of N-cad, Vim and Snail, as well as an
  obviously increased expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, uPA, and S100A4. The TCF/LEF transcription
  factor activity of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and the expression of its downstream
  target genes including cyclin D1 and c-Myc increased in the hybrid cells []. This
  type of relationship can be viewed as a symbiosis with the acquisition of new properties
  that are not characteristic of individual populations. (C) Autophagy. With the induction
  of autophagy in CSCs, the expression of ATG5-12 LC3B, and BECLIN1, as well as the
  transcription factors FOXO3A, SOX2, NANOG, and STAT3, which can lead to the induction
  of the stem phenotype, increased resistance to chemotherapy, EMT, increased migration
  activity, and survival of dormant cells [,,,]. Under starvation and toxicity, CSCs
  can also induce autophagy of neighboring microenvironmental cells and non-CSCs,
  through exposure to ROS, IL6, and HIF1a. In this case, cells produce metabolites
  that feed CSCs, in particular lactate []. In this case, the behavior of CSCs can
  be seen as parasitism. (D) Cel-in-Cell. E-cadherin and P-cadherin are key components
  of the adherent junctions of cells in entosis process []. These molecules bind CSCs
  and non-CSCs scavenged. Increased RHO–RHO-associated coiled-coil-containing protein
  kinase (ROCK) and/or diaphanous-related formin 1 (DIA 1)–actomyosin show in losers
  cells []. CSCs express ezrin, actin, and caveolins, which mediate uptake []. Absorbed
  cells undergo apoptosis, autophagy, or are destroyed by lysosomal digestion, providing
  CSCs with nutrients []. In addition, entosis can lead to the formation of aneuploidy
  in CSCs [], and this may be a rapid mechanism for the formation of new chemoresistant
  clones during treatment.
