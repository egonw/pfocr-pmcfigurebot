caption: Top 20 enriched signaling pathways targeted by miRNAs expressed in ATII cells.
  The 111 miRNAs expressed at similar levels in pATII and sATII were used as inputs
  for the miRNA target filter module in Ingenuity®. The top 20 signaling pathways
  associated with the dataset are shown. The significance of this association is expressed
  by the probability (grey bars) that the association between the targets and the
  pathway is not due to chance (BH-adjusted p-value, Fisher’s exact test). The degree
  of miRNA interaction within a certain pathway was calculated as the ratio of the
  number of targets that map to a given pathway to the total number of molecules within
  the pathway (black line). The dashed line indicates the significance threshold at
  p = 0.001. An asterisk highlights signaling pathways that have been associated previously
  with fibrosis and/or EMT.
