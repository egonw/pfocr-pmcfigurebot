caption: In vitro target validation process. In vitro target validation in cultured
  cells is used as a first approach to validate and screen several targets, aiming
  to triage targets with strong support for further target validation in advanced
  in vitro systems. Data from all systems feed into each other to select the most
  translatable model and define the correct stressor that regulates target and pathway.
  An in vitro target validation toolbox may comprise various assays, stressors, and
  readouts, which are chosen based on the disease biology of the target. ADMA, asymmetric
  dimethylarginine (arginine metabolite); CKD, chronic kidney disease; ECAR, extracellular
  acidification rate; HGEC, human glomerular endothelial cell; HMOX, hem oxygenase;
  IHC, immunohistochemistry; iPSC, induced pluripotent stem cell; MMPs, matrix metalloproteinases;
  MSC, mesenchymal stem cell; OCR, oxygen consumption rate; PAN, pyromycin aminonucleoside;
  PTEC, proximal tubular epithelial cell; RPTEC, renal proximal tubular epithelial
  cell; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism; TGF, transforming growth factor; TLR,
  toll-like receptor; ROS, reactive oxygen species. 1. Faivre A et al. Front Med (Lausanne)
