caption: 'RRP9 overexpression induces gemcitabine resistance in PC in vivo. A Representative
  images showing tumor masses removed from mice with xenografted tumors formed by
  RRP9-overexpressing or RRP9-silenced cells after gemcitabine treatment. B Luminescence
  signal of xenografted tumors formed by RRP9-overexpressing or RRP9-silenced PC cells
  in mice after exposure to gemcitabine. C Tumor volumes were calculated on timing
  that indicated. Data are denoted by mean ± SD, n = 5. D Tumor weights of the xenografted
  tumors formed by RRP9-overexpressing or RRP9-silenced cells after gemcitabine treatment.
  Data are presented as mean ± SD, n = 5. E Representative images of RRP9 (scale bar:
  50 μm) and TUNEL immunofluorescence staining (scale bar: 100 μm) in xenografted
  tumors formed by RRP9-overexpressing or RRP9-silenced cells after gemcitabine treatment.
  Quantification of apoptotic data. Data are denoted by mean ± SD, n = 3. Note: *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01'
