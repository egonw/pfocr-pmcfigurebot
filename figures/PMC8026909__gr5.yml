caption: Western pathway analyses of drug responses- PTPN11(A) Western blot analysis
  of indicated PTPN11 models, which had a mild effect on the MAPK pathway (also see
  ). All three isoforms induced almost two-fold upregulation of pEGFR levels; some
  drug treatments suppressed this induction. These isoforms showed differential regulation
  of growth inhibitory Hippo pathway marker pLATS and pMOBS. Notably, PTPN11N308D
  lines exhibited reduced levels of these markers while drug treatments reversed that
  effect and upregulated one or both markers.(B) Western blot analysis of indicated
  PTPN11 models. These two isoforms consistently reduced levels of growth inhibitory
  Hippo pathway markers pLATS and pMOBS; drug treatments reversed that effect, leading
  to upregulation of one or both markers. See  for size markers.
