figure_title: ESCRT-I mediates the degradation of lysosomal membrane proteins in RKO
  cells
caption: '(A) Maximum intensity projection confocal images of fixed RKO cells showing
  intracellular distribution of ubiquitin (green), LysoTracker dye (red), and LAMP1
  (gray) in ESCRT-I–depleted (siTsg101#1 or #2, siVps28#1 or #2) or control (Ctrl#1,
  #2, nontargeting siRNAs) cells. Cell nuclei marked with DAPI stain (gray). Enlarged
  lysosomes enriched in ubiquitinated proteins at lysosomal outer membranes, marked
  with LAMP1, are indicated by arrowheads. Scale bar, 10 μm. (B) Representative Western
  blots (upper panel) showing the levels of ectopically expressed GFP-MCOLN1 (detected
  by anti-GFP antibodies) and ESCRT-I components in control or ESCRT-I–depleted RKO
  cells. The graph (lower panel) shows GFP-MCOLN1 levels expressed as fold change
  with respect to averaged values measured for siCtrl#1 and #2 by densitometry analysis
  of Western blotting bands. Vinculin was used as a gel-loading control. Values derived
  from independent experiments and their means (n = 4 ± SEM) are presented. Statistical
  significance tested by comparison to siCtrl#1. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. (C) Representative
  single confocal plane images of fixed cells showing the effect of ESCRT-I depletion
  and/or 18 h bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) treatment on the intracellular distribution of
  ectopically expressed GFP-MCOLN1 (green), with respect to LAMP1 (red) and LysoTracker
  dye (gray). In control cells, GFP-MCOLN1 accumulation on LAMP1-positive vesicles
  indicated by arrows. GFP-MCOLN1 accumulation on enlarged LAMP1-positive lysosomal
  structures in ESCRT-I–depleted cells indicated by arrowheads. Cell nuclei marked
  with DAPI stain (gray). Scale bar, 10 μm. (C, D) Dot plot showing the fluorescence
  intensity of GFP-MCOLN1 colocalizing with LAMP1-positive vesicles expressed in arbitrary
  units (a.u.) in confocal microscopy images of control or ESCRT-I–depleted cells
  and/or upon18 h bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) treatment (shown in C). Values derived from
  independent experiments (dots) and their means (n = 4 ± SEM) are presented. Statistical
  significance tested by comparison to averaged values measured for siCtrl#1 and #2
  (AveCtrl). ns—nonsignificant, #P < 0.1, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. (E) Representative
  Western blots showing the abundance of GFP-MCOLN1, Tsg101, and Vps28 proteins in
  control and Tsg101-depleted cells treated with cycloheximide (CHX, 100 μg/ml) for
  the indicated time periods. Graphs on the right show fold change of GFP-MCOLN1 levels
  measured by densitometry analysis of Western blotting bands, including those shown
  on the left. Values derived from independent experiments and their means (n = 4
  ± SEM) are presented. Statistical significance tested by comparison to siCtrl#1-
  or siTsg101#2-treated samples.'
