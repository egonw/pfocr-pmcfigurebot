figure_title: DTX-CPT-Gel therapy activates Perk-mediated UPR
caption: (A) A schematic showing different UPR pathways. (B and C) Immunoblot (B)
  and quantification of expression (means ± SEM; n = 3) (C) of key proteins of PERK-EIF2α-ATF4-Chop
  pathway in 4T1 tumors on DTX-CPT-Gel therapy compared to untreated tumors. (D) Immunohistochemistry
  micrographs of untreated and DTX-CPT-Gel–treated 4T1 tumor sections showing caspase
  3 expression. (E) Quantitation (means ± SD; n = 3) of Bip, Atf4, Chop, and Gadd34
  gene expression in 4T1 tumors by qRT-PCR on DTX-CPT-Gel therapy. (F and G) Immunoblot
  (F) and quantification of expression (means ± SEM; n = 3) (G) of IRE1α, p-IRE1α,
  XBP1s, and ATF6 in 4T1 tumors on DTX-CPT-Gel therapy as compared to untreated tumors.
  (H) Quantitative change (means ± SD; n = 3) in expression of unspliced (Xbp1) and
  spliced (Xbp1s) forms of Xbp1 in 4T1 tumors on DTX-CPT-Gel therapy. (I) Change in
  tumor growth kinetics (means ± SEM; n = 6 to 8) in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice on treatment
  with DTX-CPT-Gel therapy in the absence or presence of PERK inhibitor. (J and K)
  Change in population (means ± SEM; n = 4 to 5) of CD8+ T cells (J) and granzyme
  B+CD8+ T cells (of total cells) (K) on inhibiting PERK pathway. Data in (C), (E),
  (G), (H), (J), and (K) were analyzed by two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test and,
  in (I), by two-way ANOVA. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.005, and ****P < 0.0001.
