caption: MiR-18a-5p targeted the Hist1h2bc gene to promote osteoblast differentiation.
  (A) Differential genes heat map for transcriptome sequencing between mimic group
  and control group. (B) Schematic diagram of miR-18a-5p targeting the Hist1h2bc gene.
  (C) Dual-luciferase reporter assay of miR-18a-5p targeting the Hist1h2bc gene (WT
  represents wild-type Hist1h2bc, Mut represents the Hist1h2bc mutant, mimic represents
  miR-18a-5p mimics, and NC represents the miR-18a-5p negative control). (D) MC3T3-E1
  transfected with miR-18a-5p mimic or inhibition were osteogenic-induced for 7 d,
  the mRNA expression of Hist1h2bc gene. (E)Hist1h2hc gene expression during osteoblast
  differentiation. (F, G) MC3T3-E1 transfected with miR-18a-5p mimic or inhibition
  were osteogenic-induced for 7 d. (F) mRNA qPCR. (G) Nucleus proteins and cytoplasmic
  proteins Western blot. (I) After 7 d osteogenic induction of MC3T3-E1 cells with
  miR-18a-5p or Hist1h2hc, mRNA qPCR. The data are represented as mean ± SEM or SD.
