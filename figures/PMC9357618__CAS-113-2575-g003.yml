caption: Sulfotransferase family 2A member 1 (SULT2A1)‐dependent alternation of 27‐hydroxycholesterol
  (27‐OHC) is correlated with the activation of the nuclear factor‐κB (NF‐κβ) signaling
  pathway, together with elevated Twist1 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
  (A, B) Expression of p65, p‐p65, and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)‐related
  transcription factors were determined by western blotting analysis. Huh7 (including
  shSULT2A1 group) (A) and HCC‐LM3 (including SULT2A1 group) (B) were treated with
  or without 2 μM 27‐OHC for 72 h. (C, D) Several downstream genes of the NF‐κB signaling
  pathway which connected with tumor migration were evaluated by Quantitative RT‐PCR
  analysis after treatment with 27‐OHC in SULT2A1‐shRNA stably expressed Huh7 (C)
  and SULT2A1 overexpressed HCC‐LM3 (D) cells. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
  ns, not significant. (E, F) Expression of p65, p‐p65, Twist1, and EMT markers in
  Huh7 (E) and HCC‐LM3 (F) cells were determined by western blot analysis. All groups
  were treated with or without 2 μM 27‐OHC and 5 μM Bay11‐7082 for 72 h. (G, H) Expression
  of p65, p‐p65, Twist1, and EMT markers were determined by western blot analysis.
  Huh7 (including shSULT2A1 group) (G) and HCC‐LM3 (including SULT2A1 group) (H) were
  treated with or without 2 μM 27‐OHC and 5 μM Bay11‐7082 for 72 h
