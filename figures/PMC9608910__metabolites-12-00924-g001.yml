caption: Analysis of functional enrichment of proteins with different abundance (p
  â‰¤ 0.05) in PBMC of (A) MAP-resistant and (B) persistently MAP-infected cows after
  48 h incubation with MAP in vitro. Functional enrichment shows the 20 most significant
  categories of all available gene sets. Hierarchical clustering was performed using
  ShinyGO. The y-axis lists the assigned pathways in order of FDR values for the enrichment
  of each pathway. The x-axis shows the values in order of FDR enrichment for related
  paths. The color map shows the enrichment of the FDR for each path. The size of
  the dots corresponds to the number of genes associated with each pathway. The corresponding
  pathway enrichment data for MAP-resistant and persistently MAP-infected cows are
  shown in more detail in . (A) Bos taurus toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and Bos taurus
  major histocompatibility complex, class II, DR alpha (BOLA-DRA, MHC class II) were
  associated with several signaling pathways enriched in lysates from MAP-resistant
  cows after 48-h incubation with MAP in vitro, whereas (B) Bos taurus integrin, alpha
  2b (ITGA2B, CD41) and Bos taurus potassium large conductance calcium-activated channel,
  subfamily M, alpha member 1 (KCNMA1) were associated with enriched signaling pathways
  in PBMC from persistently MAP-infected cows after 48-h incubation with MAP in vitro.
