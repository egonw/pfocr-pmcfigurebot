caption: (a) Volcano plots of genes in GSE67644. Red, blue, and gray colors indicate
  relatively high, low, and equal expressions of genes, respectively. (b) The top
  20 pathways in KEGG pathway analyses of differentially expressed genes between Pdgfc
  -/- mutant mice and controls. (c) The PPI network of the MAPK signaling pathway
  and cell adhesion molecules. (d) The expression changes of Pdgfc, Cacnb4, and Nrxn3
  in Pdgfc -/- mutant mice and control groups. (e) The correlation between Pdgfc,
  Cacnb4, and Nrxn3 expressions in craniofacial structures during embryonic mouse
  development (E10.5d-E14.5d). ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
