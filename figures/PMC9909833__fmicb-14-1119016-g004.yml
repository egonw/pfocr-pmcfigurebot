caption: Characterization of the DEGs between gmsweet15 mutant and WT. (A,B) Significantly
  enriched GO biological process terms in the upregulated (A) and downregulated (B)
  DEGs in gmsweet15_24 h vs. WT_24 h. (C,D) Significantly enriched KEGG pathways in
  the upregulated (C) and downregulated (D) DEGs in gmsweet15_24 h vs. WT_24 h. (E,
  F) DEGs of significantly enriched photosynthesis pathway (E) and plant-pathogen
  interaction pathway (F) in gmsweet15_24 h vs. WT_24 h. (G–K) Box plots showing expression
  level (z-score) related to protein ubiquitination (G), MAPK signaling pathway-plant
  (H), plant-pathogen interaction (I), phenylpropanoid biosynthesis (J) and photosynthesis
  (K) in global gene. Asterisks indicate a statistically significant difference (*p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001) according to a two-tailed comparisons
  t-test, and ns represent no statistical difference. For K, different letters indicate
  statistically significant differences (adjusted p < 0.05, two-tailed Student’s t-test,
  Benjamini–Hochberg method). For expression data and full GO or KEGG lists, see .
