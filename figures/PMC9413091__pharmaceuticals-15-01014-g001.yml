caption: Network pharmacology analysis of galangin in PD. (A) Venn diagram of the
  common targets of galangin in PD. (B) The potential therapeutic targets were analyzed
  using the STRING database. (C) The construction of the galangin-target-PD network
  by the Cytoscape v3.7.1 software (Cytoscape Consortium, Seattle, WA, USA). (D) Protein–protein
  interaction (PPI) network based on the core targets of galangin against PD according
  to the screening conditions of Degree > 8, BC > 0.01815109, and CC > 0.5.
