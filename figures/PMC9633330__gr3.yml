caption: 'Assessment of Treg-cell functional gene expression and frequency in cisgender
  and transgender individualsViolin plots displaying circulating Treg-cell (CD4+CD25+CD127–)
  frequencies between seven pre-pubertal cisgender boys and seven cisgender girls,
  assessed by t test (A), and 17 post-pubertal cisgender men, 22 cisgender women,
  five transgender men, and five transgender women, assessed by one-way ANOVA (B);
  measured by flow cytometry; data are mean (SE). FACS-sorted Treg cells (CD4+CD25+CD127–)
  from five young, post-pubertal cisgender men and five cisgender women and five transgender
  men and five transgender women were analysed by RNA-sequencing and whole genome
  expression was compared by gender. Volcano plots displaying log2 fold changes and
  log10 p values of DEGs between transgender men and cisgender women (C) and transgender
  women and cisgender men (D): the red and blue points represent statistically significantly
  DEGs below p value threshold (p<0·01). Cluster significance –log10 p values of enriched
  DEG pathway ontology terms of Treg cells between transgender men and cisgender women
  (E). Hierarchical clustering heatmap (Clustvis, Pearson''s) of normalised gene counts
  of DEGs found in the functional genetic pathway ontology terms in for transgender
  men versus cisgender women (F, G). Cluster significance –log10 p values of enriched
  DEG pathway ontology terms of Treg cells between transgender women versus cisgender
  men (H). Hierarchical clustering heatmap (Clustvis, Pearson''s) of normalised gene
  counts of DEGs found in the functional genetic pathway ontology terms in for transgender
  women versus cisgender men (I, J). Box and whisker plots of Treg-cell gene expression
  by normalised counts of genes associated with the (K) cytokine signalling, and (L)
  cell growth and activation pathways; data are mean (SE). ANOVA=analysis of variance.
  DEGs=differentially expressed genes. FACS=fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Treg=regulatory
  T. Tresp=responder T.'
