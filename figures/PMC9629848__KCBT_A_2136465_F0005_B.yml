caption: Effects of down-regulated or over-expressed STEAP2 on the key EMT hallmarks
  and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. According to the results of western-blot (a) and
  its relative gray value (b), as well as qRT-PCR outcomes (c), STEAP2 knockdown significantly
  increased the epithelial marker E-cadherin level and reduced the levels of N-cadherin
  and vimentin, the interstitial markers. Besides, the levels of transcriptional factors
  like Slug, Snail and Twist were also significantly reduced, indicating the EMT event
  repression by the STEAP2 down-regulation. STEAP2 up-regulation induced EMT, showing
  the E-cadherin level decline, as well as the elevation of N-cadherin, Vimentin,
  Slug, Snail and Twist levels. According to western-blot outcomes (d) and its relative
  gray value (e), the STEAP2 repression weakened the phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT,
  and mTOR pronouncedly, while the up-regulation of STEAP2 enhanced such phosphorylation
  prominently. *P < .05.
