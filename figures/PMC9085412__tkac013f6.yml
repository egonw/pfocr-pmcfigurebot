caption: HIF-1α-induced HOXC6 promotes the development of keloid fibroblasts through
  the ERK signaling pathway. (a) Schematic representation of the HIF-1α/HOXC6/ERK
  axis involved in keloid fibroblasts. HIF-1α positively regulates HOXC6, which further
  promotes the proliferation, migration, apoptosis inhibition and ECM accumulation
  of keloid fibroblasts through the ERK signaling pathway. HOXC6 could be a promising
  novel therapeutic target in keloid. (b) Protein expression of HIF-1α, HOXC6 and
  p-ERK in the si-HIF-1α-KF group was assessed by western blot. GAPDH served as a
  loading control. (c) Protein expression of HIF-1α, HOXC6 and p-ERK in the si-HOXC6-KF
  group was assessed by western blot. GAPDH served as a loading control. (d) Protein
  expression of HIF-1α, HOXC6, collagen I, α-SMA and p-ERK in the KF + SCH772984 group
  was assessed by western blot. GAPDH served as a loading control. (e) Proliferation
  of the KF + SCH772984 group was assessed by CCK-8 assay. (f) Apoptosis of the KF + SCH772984
  group was monitored by flow cytometry. (g) Migration of cells in the KF + SCH772984
  group was detected by transwell assay. Scale bar = 100 μm (×20 magnification). Data
  are representative images or expressed as the means ± SD (n = 3). *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01.
