caption: Genes differentially expressed in the presence of VRC. (a) Volcano plot of
  differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showing the log10 q-value (y-axis) vs. log2
  fold change (x-axis). The cut-off values (dotted grey lines) used to define significant
  DEGs were a q-value of < 0.05 and a log2 fold change > |1|, i.e., larger than 2-fold.
  (b) Heatmap dendrogram (blue = down-regulation, red = up-regulation) for the normalized
  mRNA expression levels (log2 of FPKMs) of the 316 DEGs relative to their combined
  average expression levels for each of the three biological replicates grown in the
  absence (UT1, UT2, UT3) or presence (80 min; T1, T2, T3) of sub-growth inhibitory
  concentrations of VRC (16 mg/L). The hierarchical clustering indicates biologically
  meaningful results. Colours of the vertical bar next to the y-axis dendrogram indicate
  different levels of down-regulation (cyan-blue) or up-regulation (orange-magenta-red)
  of groups of transcripts.
