caption: 'Different outcomes of kynurenine pathway alterations in cancer. Panel (A):
  the aberrant induction of the first module, as observed in colorectal carcinomas
  (CRC), leads to the accumulation of kynurenine, thereby promoting tumor growth and
  immune evasion. Panel (B): aberrant induction of the two modules, as observed in
  triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC), fuels cells with NAD+ and promotes cancer
  cell dissemination. Panel (C): Inactivation of the second module, as observed in
  clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), leads to the accumulation of quinolinic
  acid and favors tumor development. (D): Inactivation of both modules, as observed
  in hepatomacarcinomas, prevents NAD+ production, favors genomic instability and,
  thereby, tumor development.'
