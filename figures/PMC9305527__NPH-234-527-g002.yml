caption: Nicotiana attenuata 2‐alkenal reductase 1 (NaAER1) catalyzes the final step
  in benzylacetone (BA) biosynthesis. (a, b) Mean (± SD) levels of headspace BA and
  endogenous BA measured in NaAER1‐silenced flowers (mean ± SD; **, P < 0.01; ***,
  P < 0.001; two‐tailed Student’s t‐test). BA levels were reduced in NaAER1‐silenced
  flowers. Green fluorescent protein (GFP), plant infected TRV2‐GFP (a truncated form),
  which was used as a negative control; VIGS‐AER, a NaAER1‐silenced plant, which was
  generated by virus‐induced gene silencing (VIGS). (c) Benzalacetone, a metabolic
  intermediate of BA, was emitted from NaAER1‐silenced flowers and not from control
  flowers (mean ± SD; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; two‐tailed Student’s t‐test).
  Right panel shows a novel gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) peak in headspace
  of a NaAER1‐silenced flower, which has the same retention time and mass fragmentation
  pattern as the benzalacetone standard. (d) Kinetic parameters (best‐fit value ± SE)
  of NaAER1 determined from in vitro enzyme assays of heterologously purified NaAER1
  protein. Best‐fit catalytic values were calculated by fitting with the Michaelis–Menten
  curve.
