caption: Comparison of lignan production by strains ER_CgL1 and ER_CueO. Extracellular
  lignan titers were measured 24Â h after induction with IPTG. Dimerization of coniferyl
  alcohol was initiated by one-electron oxidation catalyzed by CgL1 or CueO. The numbering
  of metabolites corresponds to .
article_title: A targeted metabolomics method for extra- and intracellular metabolite
  quantification covering the complete monolignol and lignan synthesis pathway.
