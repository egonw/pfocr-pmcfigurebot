caption: Schematic diagram representing the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-angiogenic
  effects of brassinin. Brassinin stimulates the lysosomal degradation of Tie2 as
  well as the lysosomal and proteasomal degradation of FGFR1 in endothelial cells.
  This results in the down-regulation of the AKT and ERK pathway and, thus, the inhibition
  of angiogenesis.
