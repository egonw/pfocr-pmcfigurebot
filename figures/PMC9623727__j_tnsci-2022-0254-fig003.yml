caption: Acacetin prevents NLRP3 signaling pathway in the brain tissue of AD mice.
  Protein expressions of NLRP3, pro-caspase-1, pro-IL-1β, and IL-1β were measured
  by WB assay. (a) Representative immunoblots. (b–f) Densitometric analysis of NLRP3,
  pro-caspase-1, caspase-1, pro-IL-1β, and IL-1β normalized to β-actin. Data are presented
  as mean ± SD. N = 6 mice in each group. One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc
  test was used. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01.

  model mice via the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway.
