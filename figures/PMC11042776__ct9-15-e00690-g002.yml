caption: (a) Bar plot showing the GO enrichment analysis of the 52 potential target
  genes that may be regulated by miR-3682-3p. (b) Bar plot illustrating the KEGG pathway
  enrichment analysis of the 52 potential target genes that may be regulated by miR-3682-3p.
  (c) Violin plot depicting the tumor microenvironment (TME) score distribution between
  the high and low expression groups based on the median miR-3682-3p expression level.
  (d) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) plot displaying the differential gene expression
  analysis between the high and low miR-3682-3p expression groups. (e) Lollipop plot
  representing the relationship between miR-3682-3p expression levels and the predicted
  immune cell composition in patients with liver cancer using CIBERSORT. (f) Violin
  plot showing the tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion (TIDE) score distribution
  between the high and low miR-3682-3p expression groups. (g) Box plot depicting the
  expression levels of miR-3682-3p in patients with Ishak scores ranging from 0 to
  5 compared with those with an Ishak score of 6. (h) Box plot illustrating the expression
  levels of miR-3682-3p in patients with Ishak score 0 compared with those with Ishak
  score 6. (i) Box plot representing the expression levels of miR-3682-3p in liver
  cancer patients with hepatitis B or C virus infections compared with those with
  non–viral hepatitis-related liver cancer. (j) Box plot showing the expression levels
  of miR-3682-3p in patients with liver cancer with hepatitis B compared with those
  with non–viral hepatitis-related liver cancer. (k) Box plot displaying the expression
  levels of miR-3682-3p in patients with liver cancer with hepatitis C compared with
  those with non–viral hepatitis-related liver cancer. GO, gene ontology; KEGG, Kyoto
