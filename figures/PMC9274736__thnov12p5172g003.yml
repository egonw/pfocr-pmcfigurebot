caption: 'Specific endothelial S1pr2 gain-of-function reduces post-ischemic angiogenesis
  and blood flow perfusion after HLI. A, Generation of EC-specific S1pr2 gain-of-function
  mice. B, Relative mRNA expression levels of S1pr2 in ECs of WT and S1pr2ECTg mice
  (n = 3). C-D, Western blotting analysis of S1pr2 protein levels in ECs from S1pr2ECTg
  mice or WT control mice, with their quantification (n = 3). E, Representative laser
  Doppler images show impaired blood perfusion in S1pr2ECTg mice compared with WT
  control mice. F, Cumulative results for WT mice (n = 8) and S1pr2ECTg mice (n =
  8) are shown as the ratio of blood flow in the ischemic limb to that in the non-ischemic
  limb at each time point. G-H, Representative images of isolectin-B4 staining of
  gastrocnemius muscles in WT and S1pr2ECTg mice (G), with quantification of capillary
  density in gastrocnemius muscles after sham or HLI operation (H) (n = 6). I-J, Representative
  images of α-SMA staining of gastrocnemius muscles in WT and S1pr2ECTg mice (I),
  with quantification of arteriole density in limb muscle after sham or HLI operation
  (J) (n = 6). K-L, Representative images of H&E staining of gastrocnemius muscles
  in WT and S1pr2ECTg mice (K), with quantification of muscle fiber area after sham
  or HLI operation (L) (n = 5). M-N, Representative images of Sirius red-stained of
  gastrocnemius muscles in WT and S1pr2ECTg mice (M), with quantification of the percentage
  of fibrotic tissue in muscle (N) (n = 5). O-Q, Functional assessment of ischemic
  muscle over follow-up. Cumulative results for WT mice and S1pr2ECTg mice are shown
  graphically as Tarlov score (O), ischemia score (P), and ambulatory impairment score
  (Q) (n = 8). Scale Bars: G and I, 50 μm; K and M, 100 μm. Data are mean ± SEM. n.s
  indicates not significant. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01.'
