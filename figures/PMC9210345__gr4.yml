caption: 'MHC class IIlow macrophages are a female-specific subset with restricted
  localization(A) scRNA-seq analysis of CD74, H2-Aa, Ciita, and the KEGG pathway “Antigen
  processing and presentation” expression among myeloid cells.(B) (Top) Flow-cytometry
  plots showing F4/80 and MHC class II expression among AGMs from 7-week-old male
  and female mice. (Bottom) Proportions and numbers of MHC class IIhigh and class
  IIlow AGMs from 7-week-old male and female wild-type mice. ♂ n = 16 and ♀ n = 15.
  Data are pooled from 3 independent experiments.(C) Fluorescence-microscopy analysis
  of CD68 and MHC class II expression in adrenal glands from 7-week-old male and female
  mice. Scale bar: 200 μm. M, medulla; C, cortex. Data are representative of at least
  3 independent experiments.(D) Distribution of CD68+ cells between cortex and medulla
  from adrenal glands of 7-week-old male and female mice. Data are represented as
  proportion of CD68+ cells from each zone among total cells. ♂ n = 4 and ♀ n = 6.
  Quantification from one experiment.(E) Proportion of MHC-IIhigh and MHC-IIlow CD68+
  cells in the cortex and medulla of adrenal glands from 7-week-old male and female
  mice. ♂ n = 4 and ♀ n = 6. Quantification from one experiment.(F) Analysis of macrophage
  metabolic activity using SCENITH, represented by Puromycin MFI (n = 14). Data pooled
  from 4 independent experiments.(G) Measure of glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism
  in macrophages using SCENITH (n = 10–11). Data pooled from 3 independent experiments.Statistical
  analysis was performed using two-tailed Mann-Whitney tests (panel B, quantifications),
  two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post-test (proportions in panel B, panel D and panel
  E), or paired Wilcoxon t-tests (panels F and G). See also .'
