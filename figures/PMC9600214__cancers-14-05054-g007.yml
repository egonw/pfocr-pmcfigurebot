caption: When ketone levels increase in the blood, the gluconeogenesis in the liver
  is reduced [,]. Ketolysis can occur in almost all healthy cells [,]. Ketones enter
  Krebs cycle through acetyl-CoA requiring oxaloacetate to enter [,]. Comparably,
  ketolysis is a short and straight pathway, and do not contribute to the production
  of anti-oxidative power or metabolites in cancer cells as glycolysis or glutaminolysis
  do (compare ).
