caption: 'Multiple signaling pathways of nuclear ER and membrane ER. Membrane-associated
  E2-ER signaling pathway. (1) E2-ER activates ERK/MAPK signaling pathway; (2) The
  activation of PKC increases endogenous levels of Ca2+, which can induce tumorigenesis
  and metastasis; (3) E2-ER activates JNK pathway and eventually promotes apoptosis;
  (4) E2-ER involved in the PI3K/AKT pathway suppresses apoptosis; (5) E2-ER activates
  Camp; E2-ER signaling pathway in the nucleus. Phosphorylation of ER combined with
  E2 mediates the formation of ER-ERE complex, leading to transcription. ER: estrogen
  receptor; ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein
  kinase; PKC: protein kinase C; IP3: inositol triphosphate; IP3R: inositol triphosphate
  receptor; cAMP: activation of adenylate cyclase; ERE: estrogen response element.'
