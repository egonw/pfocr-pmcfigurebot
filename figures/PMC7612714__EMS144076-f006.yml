  for SI
caption: (A) Membrane (M) and soluble (S) fractions from WT and atpgap1 (atpgap1-c1)
  plants were extracted and localization of GFP–SKU5 (~120 kDa) proteins were analyzed
  on western blots. In the WT, GFP–SKU5 was detected in both fractions, but in the
  atpgap1 mutant, GFP–SKU5 was only detected in the membrane fraction, consistent
  with defective cleavage. Aquaporin (~26 kDa) is shown as a control for membrane
  extraction; loading control shows signals from a PROTEAN TGX Stain-Free Precast
  gel (Bio-Rad).(B) Whole proteins were extracted using 2% Triton X-114 extraction
  buffer, partitioned into aqueous (A) and detergent (D) phases. Western blot analysis
  showed that GFP–SKU5 (~120 kDa) was primarily enriched in the aqueous phase in the
  WT, but in the atpgap1 mutant it was primarily detected in the detergent phase,
  revealing that mutation of AtPGAP1 resulted in an increase of GFP–SKU5 hydrophobicity.
  Aquaporin (~26 kDa) is shown as a control for membrane extraction; loading control
  shows signals from a PROTEAN TGX Stain-Free Precast gel (Bio-Rad).(C) Col-0 and
  At-PrpS1 pollen grains were pretreated with the PLC inhibitor, U73122, or solvent
  (Mock) before subject to SI induction (PrsS1) or control treatment (AtGM) in vitro
  and samples were co-stained with FDA and PI 6h after treatment. Four independent
  experiments were carried out; 100-200 pollen grains were counted for each treatment.
  At-PrpS1 pollen treated with recombinant PrsS1 and mock solvent had high levels
  of death; treatment of At-PrpS1 pollen with recombinant PrsS1 and U73122 resulted
  in significant lower levels of death. This suggests that cleavage of GPI-APs by
  PLC is required for mediating SI-induced death of pollen.(D) GPI-anchoring is a
  post-translational modification involving several phases which have been established
  in mammals and yeast. First, biosynthesis of the GPI involves a series of events
  [steps 1-10]. Once the core GPI is assembled [step 10], the target precursor protein
  (blue sphere) is transferred to the GPI by a GPI transamidase complex [step 11].
  The nascent immature GPI-AP then undergoes remodeling; the first of these is deacylation
  [step 12], involving PGAP1, which we identified in this study (indicated in pink).
  After this, several other PGAP genes (not shown) mediate further modification during
  the transport from ER to the Golgi and then to the plasma membrane. The genes involved
  in GPI biosynthesis identified in humans are indicated in black; genes identified
  in plants are indicated in green. Knockouts of genes early in the biosynthetic pathway
  in mammals result in lack of expression of GPI-APs at the plasma membrane; in plants
  homozygous knockouts of the orthologs of PIG-C and PIG-A, SETH1 and SETH2, are lethal.
  We show in this study that mutation of SETH1 or SETH2 in At-PrpS1 pollen alleviates
  SI-induced pollen death. By analogy to animal systems, it is likely that the seth1/2
  mutants lack GPI-APs at the plasma membrane (grey outline). Our data implicate GPI-APs
  at the plasma membrane are required for the SI response, as the normal SI-PCD response
  is prevented in their absence. After generation of the nascent GPI-APs, the acyl
  chain linked to inositol is removed by the GPI-deacylase, PGAP1 [step 12]. In the
  atpgap1/hld1 mutant, this step does not occur. As a consequence, the GPI-APs retain
  their inositol-linked acyl chain (indicated in pink), giving a 3-footed configuration
  responsible for retaining the GPI-AP in the plasma membrane in mammalian cells.
  Here we provide evidence that this is also the case in plants. We show that knockout
  of PGAP1 completely prevents SI, resulting in full fertility. This demonstrates
  that inositol deacylation, required for maturation of GPI-APs, is critical for the
  SI response. We propose that during an incompatible SI induction when the ligand
  PrsS interacts with plasma-membrane localized PrpS, this S-specific interaction
  may require interaction (direct or indirect) with (unknown) GPI-APs. Cartoon adapted
