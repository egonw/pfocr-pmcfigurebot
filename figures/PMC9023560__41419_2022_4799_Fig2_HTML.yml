figure_title: Activating the HGF/c-Met signaling pathway promotes PNI in pancreatic
  cancer
caption: A, B Cancer cell-DRG coculture model for the control and HGF groups in PANC-1
  cells and BxPC-3 cells. C, D Western blot analysis of the expression of p-Met, c-Met,
  NGF at different HGF concentrations in PANC-1 cells and BxPC-3 cells. E, F Wound
  healing assay of the control and HGF groups in PANC-1 cells and BxPC-3 cells. G,
  H Transwell-based assay of the control and HGF groups in PANC-1 cells and BxPC-3
  cells. I, J Western blot analysis of the expression of p-Met, c-Met, N-cadherin,
  E-cadherin, and Vimentin in PANC-1 cells and BxPC-3 cells treated with different
  HGF concentrations. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.
