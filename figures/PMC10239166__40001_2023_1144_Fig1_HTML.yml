caption: T cell transcriptional regulation mechanism in psoriasis. Psoriasis is driven
  by many nonspecific triggers. Triggers such as infections and physical injury stimulate
  DCs to release pro-inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-1β, IL-21, IL-23, TNF-α and IL-12).
  These cytokines stimulate the activation of naive CD4 + T cells and secrete IL-12,
  IL-23 and IL-6, IL-10 and TGF-β, IL-4 differentiated into Th1 cells, Th17 cells,
  Treg cells and Th2 cells, respectively. IL-12 combines with naive CD4 + T cell surface
  receptor, IL-12R, and their interaction leads to activation of the transcription
  factors STAT1 and T-bet, thereby promoting the polarization of Th1 cells. T-bet
  and STAT1 form a positive feedback regulatory loop for upregulating IL-12 and promoting
  Th1 polarization. Th17 cells are differentiated by ROR-γt regulation is also regulated
  by JAK–STAT3 pathway. IL-6 produced in response to inflammation continuously activates
  the STAT3 pathway, which in turn induces IL-21 expression and forms an IL-21/STAT3
  autocrine loop, thereby causing sustained activation of STAT3, upregulation of ROR-γt
  for Th17 differentiation. The differentiation of Th2 cells is regulated by GATA
  3. The balance of Th1, Th17 and Th2 is an important factor affecting the development
  of psoriasis. Treg cells can suppress the activities of other immune effector cells,
  such as Th1 and Th17 cells, through either direct contact or the secretion of suppressive
  cytokines, such as IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β. This figure was
