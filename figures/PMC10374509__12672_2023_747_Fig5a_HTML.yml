caption: 'Arte alleviates 5-FU-induced inflammation by inhibiting p38MAPK and NF-κB
  in cells and tissues. a Western blotting of t-p65, p-p65, t-p38, p-p38 and β-actin
  protein levels in HIEC cells. b, c Quantification of relative protein levels, n = 6.
  d–f Relative gene expression was normalized to that of 18S, and the genes were associated
  with the p38MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway, as detected by RT‒qPCR. g Image of relative
  protein levels of t-p65, p-p65, p-p38, t-p38, and β-actin in colonic tissue, n = 6.
  h, i Quantification of relative protein levels; j Relative gene expression was normalized
  to that of 18S in colon tissue. k, l Comparison of histopathological changes in
  each treatment group by H&E staining (100 × magnification), n = 6. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001 compared to the control group (CTL); #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001
  compared to the vehicle control or the indicated sample. 1D-day one; 3D-day three'
