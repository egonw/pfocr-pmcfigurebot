figure_title: Effects of pirtobrutinib on global DNA and RNA synthesis and inhibition
  of proximal BCR pathway in MEC-1 cells that overexpress wild-type or mutant BTK
caption: A and B Impact of pirtobrutinib or ibrutinib on DNA and RNA synthesis. Exponentially
  growing and GFP sorted MEC-1 cells overexpressing wild-type (WT), C481S, or C481R
  BTK were treated with 1 µM drug for 24 h. [3H]thymidine and [3H]uridine were used
  to determine incorporation into DNA and RNA, respectively. Data are expressed as
  percentage of DMSO-treated control cells. *p ≤ 0.05; **p ≤ 0.01; ***p ≤ 0.005. C–E
  Effect of pirtobrutinib or ibrutinib on BCR pathway signaling. Protein extracts
  were prepared from drug-treated cells and were subjected to immunoblot assays to
  determine levels of pBTK inhibition and downstream signaling of BTK in MEC-1 cells
  with BTKWT (C), BTKC481S (D), or BTKC481R (E). Vinculin and GAPDH were used as the
  loading controls. F and G Dose- and time-dependent inhibition of BTK phosphorylation
  after treatment with pirtobrutinib (orange bars) or ibrutinib (blue bars) in MEC-1
  cells overexpressing BTKWT, BTKC481S, and BTKC481R. Cells were treated at three
  different concentrations of drug at four different time points. Densitometry values
  are presented as percentage of DMSO-treated control, which is set at 1 (dashed line).
