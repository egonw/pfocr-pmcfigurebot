caption: STAT1 is enriched in HP-HUVEC-Exos. (A) Heat map of 719 differentially expressed
  proteins (cutoff, fold change ≥4 and P<0.05) between HP-HUVEC-Exos and NP-HUVEC-Exos
  according to proteomics analysis. (B) Volcano plots of 719 differentially expressed
  proteins. (C) Different expression levels of STAT1 in HP-HUVEC-Exos and NP-HUVEC-Exos
  according to proteomics analysis. (D) Expression levels of STAT1 in VSMCs treated
  with HP-HUVEC-Exos and NP-HUVEC-Exos were determined by western blot analysis. (E)
  Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analysis of STAT1 expression in VSMCs. ***P<0.001,
  ****P<0.0001 compared with the NP-HUVEC-Exos group. Ctrl, control; HP, high phosphorus;
  HUVEC-Exos, exosomes from HUVECs; NP, no phosphorus; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle
  cell.
article_title: Exosomal STAT1 derived from high phosphorus-stimulated vascular endothelial
  cells induces vascular smooth muscle cell calcification via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway.
