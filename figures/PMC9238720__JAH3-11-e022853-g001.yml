figure_title: Assessment of electron transport chain pathway and the impact of myocardial
  iron deficiency
caption: 'A. Schematic of the electron transport chain (ETC) for ATP production and
  its role in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). B and C, Reduction
  in enzymatic activities of complex I, II, III, and IV in HF samples (top panel)
  with greater functional decrease seen in complex I, II and IV in HF‐MID (bottom
  panel) (B), which were further stratified based on pathogenesis (C). A greater reduction
  in complex I and II activities were observed in DCM and CAD samples with MID, while
  reduced complex IV activity was restricted to iron‐deficient samples with CAD. n=10
  for NFC, n=36 for HF; n=6 for each HF subgroup with n=18 for HF‐MID and HF‐NID,
  respectively. D and E, Decreased citrate synthase (CS) activity in HF samples (left
  panel) compared to NFC, and it was exacerbated in HF samples with MID (right panel)
  (D), which was primarily driven by lowered CS activity in the iron‐depleted peri‐infarct
  and non‐infarct regions from CAD (E). n=10 for NFC, n=36 for HF; n=6 for each HF
  subgroup with n=18 for HF‐MID and HF‐NID, respectively. F, Linear regression analyses
  showing the strong dependence of complex I, II, IV, and CS enzyme activities on
  myocardial iron levels within HF cohort. n=36 for each enzyme, and dotted lines
  represent 95% CI. CAD‐NI indicates non‐infarcted from coronary artery disease; CAD‐PI,
  peri‐infarcted from coronary artery disease; COX I‐IV, complexes I‐IV; DCM, dilated
  cardiomyopathy; MID, myocardial iron deficiency; and NID, no myocardial iron deficiency.
  *P<0.05, **P<0.01 compared with NFC; #P<0.05, ##P<0.01 compared with HF‐NID.'
