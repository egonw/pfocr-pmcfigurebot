caption: 'The therapeutic effect combined CoNCDs with 2′,3′-cGAMP for S180 tumor therapy:
  (a) schematic illustration of the experimental procedure; (b) picture of tumors
  in different treatments; (c) percent survival of S180 tumor-bearing mice after different
  treatments, the red line coincides with the pink line.; (d) tumor growth curves
  of different treatments; (e) tumor tissues of different groups on the 11th day were
  observed under a standard optical microscope (10 × 10) after H&E staining. 1: PBS;
  2: 2′,3′-cGAMP (intravenously injected, 18 μg); 3: CoNCDs were intravenously injected
  (CoNCDs = 0.3 mg); 4: CoNCDs were intravenously injected (CoNCDs = 0.3 mg) plus
  2′,3′-cGAMP (intravenously injected, 18 μg); and 5: CoNCDs were intravenously injected
  (CoNCDs = 0.5 mg) plus 2′,3′-cGAMP (intravenously injected, 18 μg). * p < 0.05;
  **** p < 0.0001.'
