caption: IX promotes intestinal lipid excretion. (A) Amount of energy in feces collected
  for 24 h from each mouse (n = 6–7 per group). (B, C) Concentrations of various classes
  of (B) fatty acids and (C) triglycerides in feces collected at 24 h from each mouse
  (n = 9–10 per group). (D) A simplified metabolic pathway of xanthohumol in the gut
  microbiota. (E) Lipase activity of IX and 8-prenylnaringenin at the indicated concentrations
  (n = 3 per group). (F) qPCR analysis of various lipid transporter-related genes
  in the jejunum of mice at 18 weeks old (n = 11–14 per group). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001, by unpaired two-tailed t test for (A), unpaired t-test or Mann-Whitney
  U-test followed by the Benjamini-Hochberg post-test (q < 0.05) (F) and ANOVA, followed
  by Tukey-Kramer post doc for (E). ∗adjusted P < 0.05, ∗∗adjusted P < 0.01, ∗∗∗adjusted
  P < 0.001, by multiple Mann Whitney U tests (B and C). Data are presented as the
  mean ± SEM.
