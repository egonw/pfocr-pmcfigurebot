figure_title: TRAF2 promotes tumor growth in vitro and in vivo in a p62-dependent
  manner
caption: A Cell proliferation was evaluated by the ATPlite growth assay for 5 days
  (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, n = 3, two-way repeated-measures ANOVA analysis). B Cell
  clonogenic ability was expressed by coomassie blue staining (left) and colony counting
  (right) (Student’s t test, mean ± SEM, n = 3, ***p < 0.001). C, D/E Knockdown of
  p62 partially rescued TRAF2-mediated tumor suppression, tumor volumes, and weight
  were measured (n = 5 for each group, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, D two-way repeated-measures
  ANOVA analysis; E Student’s t test, mean ± SEM). F mTORC1 activity was analyzed
  in nude mice tumor tissues, following IBs with indicated Abs. G Representative immunohistochemistry
  images (up). IHC score of indicated protein (below, ***p < 0.001, n = 5, Student’s
  t test, mean ± SEM). Scale bar = 100 μm.
article_title: The TRAF2-p62 axis promotes proliferation and survival of liver cancer
  by activating mTORC1 pathway.
