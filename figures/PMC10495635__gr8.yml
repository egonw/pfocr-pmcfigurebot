  using TargetScan and miRDB.(B) BCAT1 mRNA expression in tissues.(C) THUMPD3-AS1
  levels were positively correlated with mRNA expression levels of BCAT1 in tissues.(D)
  miR-1297 levels were negatively correlated with BCAT1 mRNA expression levels in
  tissues.(E) Expression levels of BCAT1 mRNA in different cell lines.(F) Effect of
  the overexpression of miR-1297 on BCAT1 mRNA and protein levels.(G) Effect of the
  inhibition of miR-1297 on BCAT1 mRNA and protein levels.(H) Dual-luciferase reporter
  assay.
