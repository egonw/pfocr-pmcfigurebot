caption: The expression of BMP2 in LSCC and its relationship with clinical features.
  A Expression analysis of BMP2 using qRT-PCR. B WB analysis of the expression of
  BMP2. C Multivariate Cox regression analyses. D, G Representative figures of IHC
  staining for BMP2. E, H Statistical analysis of IHC staining intensity. F Histogram
  of chi-square test. I KM survival curve of BMP2 on OS in TCGA and GEO cohorts. J
  VM vessels (CD3-/PAS +) and BMP2 were observed by staining LSCC. K Statistical analysis
  of the number of VM. L The analysis of the correlation between the number of VM
  and BMP2. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, Student’s t-test and one-way ANOVA
article_title: RUNX1-BMP2 promotes vasculogenic mimicry in laryngeal squamous cell
