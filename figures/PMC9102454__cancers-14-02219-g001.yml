caption: 'Correlation between ctDNA, AR amplification and PSA kinetics. The picture
  synthesizes the role of AR and its action mediated by various transcriptional co-regulators.
  Activation of target genes leads to biological responses including growth, survival
  and the production of PSA. The AR targeting agents could inhibit this pathway, but
  the onset of AR amplification can bypass this inhibition. ctDNA is released from
  dying cancer cells, or, more rarely, from living tumor cells that actively release
  DNA and exosomes into the circulation because of oncogenic properties. Abbreviations:
  AR, androgen receptor, ARE, androgen response elements; ctDNA, circulating tumor
  DNA; PSA, prostate specific antigen.'
