caption: 'Depletion of FRG1 in breast cancer cells promotes HUVECs proliferation and
  migration. The expression of FRG1 was altered in MCF7, and MDA‐MB‐231 cells and
  the conditioned media (CM) was harvested. HUVECs were treated with the CM and subjected
  to proliferation and migration assays. (A, B) Bar diagrams show MTS assay based
  OD values taken at 490 nm at 24 h for HUVECs incubated in the CM obtained from (A)
  MCF7 cells with FRG1 knockdown (FRG1_KD) and corresponding control (Control_Sc),
  and from (B) MDA‐MB‐231 cells with ectopic expression of FRG1 (FRG1_Ex) and corresponding
  control (Control_Ev). (C) Representative images of transwell migration assay of
  HUVECs grown in the CM from MCF7 cells with FRG1 depletion (FRG1_KD) and corresponding
  control (Control_Sc). Bar diagram depicts the no. of migrated cells at 24 h. Images
  were taken at ×10 magnification. Scale bar: 50 μm. (D) Representative images of
  transwell migration assay of HUVECs grown in CM, obtained from MDA‐MB‐231 cells
  with ectopic expression of FRG1 (FRG1_Ex) and corresponding control (Control_Ev).
  The bar diagram shows the number of migrated HUVECs in the two groups. Images were
  taken at ×10 magnification. Scale bar: 50 μm. Experiments were performed in triplicate.
  Two‐tailed unpaired Student''s t‐test was used to compare the significance of the
  differences between the groups. Results are presented as mean ± SD. ****P ≤ 0.0001.'
