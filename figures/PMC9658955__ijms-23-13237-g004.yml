caption: 'Effect of LMNA on the migration and invasive capabilities of HCC827 and
  HCC827/ER cells. Representative images show the migration and invasion ability of
  HCC827, HCC827/shLMNA, HCC827/ER, and HCC827/ER-LMNA cells. Invasive cells were
  stained and counted under a microscope. Data are presented mean ± SD from five randomly
  selected visual fields. Significant differences are indicated as follows: Student’s
  t-test, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.'
