caption: MAP3K4 regulates the expression and phosphorylation of key components of
  the IGF1R signaling axis by controlling the expression of Igf1r. MAP3K4 promotes
  Igf1r transcript expression through CBP activation in TSWT cells. Localized to the
  cell surface, IGF1R is autophosphorylated upon ligand stimulation. Activation of
  the receptor induces the phosphorylation of downstream signaling components PDK1
  and Akt, promoting placental and embryonic growth. In TSKI cells, Igf1r transcript
  is repressed because of reduced CBP activity and increased HDAC6 expression and
  activity. Reduced IGF1R expression from MAP3K4 kinase inactivation impairs IGF1R
  activation of the Akt pathway. Disruption of the IGF1R/IR and Akt signaling pathway
  because of MAP3K4 kinase inactivation results in placental insufficiency and FGR.
