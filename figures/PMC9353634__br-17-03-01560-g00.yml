caption: Effect of cilostazol on ET-1 and eNOS expression in HUVECs. Cells were pre-treated
  with different concentrations of cilostazol (0, 1, 10 or 50 µM) or TNF-α. (A) ET-1
  and (B) eNOS levels were measured by ELISA. The results are presented as the mean
  ± SEM of three repeats. **P<0.01, ***P<0.001. ET-1, endothelin-1; eNOS, endothelial
  nitric oxide synthase.
article_title: Cilostazol regulates the expressions of endothelin-1 and endothelial
  nitric oxide synthase via activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway in HUVECs.
