caption: From null distribution to P value for DWPCs. Null DWPC distributions are
  shown for 3 metapaths between Alzheimer's disease and the circadian rhythm pathway,
  selected from Fig. . For each metapath, null DWPCs are computed on 200 permuted
  hetnets and grouped according to source–target degree. Histograms show the null
  DWPCs for the degree group corresponding to Alzheimer's disease and the circadian
  rhythm pathway (as noted in the plot titles by deg). The proportion of null DWPCs
  that were zero is calculated, forming the “hurdle” of the null distribution model.
  The nonzero null DWPCs are modeled using a gamma distribution, which can be fit
  solely from a sample mean and standard deviation. The mean of nonzero null DWPCs
  is denoted with a diamond, with the standard deviation plotted twice as a line in
  either direction. Actual DWPCs are compared to the gamma-hurdle null distribution
  to yield a P value.
