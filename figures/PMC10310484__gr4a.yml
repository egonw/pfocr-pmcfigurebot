caption: AElevated tissue cholesterol, triglyceride fragments, and lipolysis were
  the major lipidomic phenotype of 3-week high fat diet fed ApoE KO tissues, which
  may increase trained immunity. (A) Heart, aorta, plasma, and liver levels of cholesterol
  as well as the plasma levels of mono- and diacylglycerols and free fatty acids derived
  from triglyceride cleavages, such as 1-palmitoylglycerol, 1,3-dipalmitoylglycerol,
  and oleate, were increased in ApoE KO miceB. ApoE depletion and high-fat diet stimulation
  promoted trained immunity via increased acetyl CoA pathway. (B) High coenzyme A
  demand in the heart indicated fatty acid synthesis. (C) Anti-inflammatory n3 polyunsaturated
  fatty acid levels were significantly reduced in the aorta, liver, and plasma.
