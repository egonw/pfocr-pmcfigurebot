caption: The endogenous MAN1C1 protein is downregulated in HUVECs after irradiationHUVECs
  were irradiated at 20 Gy or not irradiated, and proteins were collected 1, 2, 4,
  and 7 days after irradiation. To produce a positive control of the MAN1C1 signal
  on the Western blot membrane, HUVECs were transduced with the pTrip-MAN1C1 or the
  pTrip-LUC lentiviral particles.(A) Representative Western blot images performed
  with anti-MAN1C1 and anti-Actin B antibodies on HUVEC protein extracts (15 μg).
  pTrip-LUC and p-Trip-MAN1C1, protein extracted (2 μg) of transduced cells with the
  corresponding lentiviral vectors. IB, immunoblot.(B) Relative densitometric bar
  graphs of ratio MAN1C1/ACTB. Data are represented as mean ± SEM of three independent
  samples for each day post-irradiation. One-way ANOVA test with Sidak correction.
  ns, not significant, ∗p ≤ 0.05, ∗∗p ≤ 0.01.(C) Overview of the putative regulatory
  network of class I α-mannosidases. Relationships between the four class I α-mannosidases,
  MAN1A1, MAN1A2, MAN1B1, and MAN1C1, their upstream regulatory entities, and the
  term “Radiation” as a treatment are shown by directional arrows (see legend on the
  right panel). Direct interactions and shortest paths were used to construct the
  network established using the literature mining algorithm of Pathway Studio software.
  MAN1C1 is highlighted in blue.See also  and .
