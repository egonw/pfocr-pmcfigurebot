figure_title: STEAP2 inhibits xenograft growth and lung metastasis of PTC in vivo
caption: 'For the in vivo tumor metastasis assay, BCPAP cells were injected subcutaneously
  into the flanks of the mice following multipoint intratumor injection with STEAP2-saRNA
  or NC-saRNA (A). Afterward, tumor weight (B) in mice at 31 days after injection
  and growth curve of xenografts (C) were determined. D STEAP2, Ki-67, and PCNA expression
  were detected by IHC in xenografts sections. Scale bar: 100 μm. For the in vivo
  tumor metastasis assay, BCPAP cells were injected into the tail vein of the mice
  following tail vein injection with STEAP2-saRNA or NC-saRNA. E Representative images
  of metastatic tumor nodules in the lung of nude mice. F Number of metastatic tumor
  nodules in the lung were compared between nude mice injected with STEAP2-saRNA and
  NC-saRNA and statistically analyzed. Scale bar: 150 μm. All data are presented as
  the mean ± standard deviation. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001.'
