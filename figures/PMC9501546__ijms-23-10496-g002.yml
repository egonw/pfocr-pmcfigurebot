caption: Knockdown of TTYH3 inhibits proliferation and sphere formation of bladder
  cancer cells. (A) Expression of TTYH3 in various cancer cell lines and normal cell
  lines. Normal liver cell line (MIHA); liver cancer cell lines (Hep G2 and SNU-449);
  normal breast epithelial cell line (MCF 10A); breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, T-47D,
  MDA-MB-231, and KU1 (breast cancer stem-like cells/tumor-initiating cells)); pancreatic
  cancer cell lines (Capan-2 and Panc2); colon cancer cell lines (HT-29 and HCT 116);
  normal bladder cell line (primary bladder fibroblast cells); bladder cancer cell
  lines (RT4, J82, and T24). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was
  used as the loading control. (B) TTYH3 expression in scramble and short hairpin
  (sh)TTYH3-transduced cells was analyzed by RT-PCR and western blot analysis in J82
  and T24 bladder cancer cell lines. GAPDH or α-tubulin expression was used as the
  control. The band density was measured using ImageJ software and the values were
  presented in graph. (C) Effect of TTYH3 knockdown on cell proliferation was analyzed
  by counting of each group of cells for 3 days. (D) Sphere-forming ability of scramble
  and shTTYH3 transduced cells. The size of the sphere was measured using ImageJ software
  and presented in graph. The scale bar denotes 500 µm. All statistical analyses were
  performed with two-way ANOVA; * p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01, and *** p ≤ 0.001.
