caption: Identification and characterization of metabolic genes correlated with CD8+
  T cells. (a) Correlation matrix of four algorithms based on the calculated scores
  of CD8+ T cells. (b) Venn diagrams showed the intersected genes. (c) Heatmap demonstrated
  relative correlation between 54 genes and CD8+ T cells through MCP algorithms and
  xCell algorithm. (d) Top 10 most enriched molecular functions in GO analyses. (e)
  Top 10 most enriched KEGG pathway enrichment analysis.
