caption: a, Bar plot represents the proportion of DCs among all myeloid cells for
  each patient (Ctrl n = 3, EuE n = 9, EcP n = 8, EcPA n = 6, EcO n = 4). Patient-to-patient
  variability was observed in DC proportions within the myeloid population and across
  different tissue types. The box represents the interquartile range with median and
  minimum/maximum represented by box centerline and whiskers, respectively. b, PAGA
  and RNA velocity trajectory analyses suggest that pre-cDC2 differentiate towards
  cDC2 and DC3 in Ctrl and EuE. Red arrows indicate that some cDC2 and DC3 cells derive
  from a smaller intermediate cell population. c, Cell cycle analysis for pre-cDC2,
  cDC2 and DC3 populations. d, Expression of DC progenitor markers FLT3, AXL, and
  SIGLEC6. e, Phagocytosis pathway is enriched in cDC2 subpopulations of peritoneal
  lesions. Bar plot shows the Normalized Enrichment Score (NES) for the top 10- GSEA
  pathways in cDC2 cells of EuE and EcPA (FDR < 0.1). Related to .
