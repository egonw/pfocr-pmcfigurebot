caption: Illustration of convergent pathways for differentially expressed genes and
  proteins. The number and cellular location of up and downregulated differentially
  expressed genes (DEG) categorized by convergent pathways for GO terms in biological
  processes (see  for specific GO terms and genes) were combined with the number of
  up and down regulated significantly differentially expressed proteins (DEP) (see  and  for
  specific proteins) in RER-susceptible compared to control horses. The number of
  genes corresponds to the number of genes in the GO term with the largest gene set
  for the convergent pathway (). DEP and DEG for processes of purine nucleotide metabolism,
  the electron transfer system (ETS), tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and fat metabolism
  are depicted within the mitochondrion. Between episodes of rhabdomyolysis, RER-susceptible
  horses showed upregulation of cellular inflammation, cellular/oxidative stress response,
  cell regeneration, protein modification and sarcomere proteins. Metabolic pathways
  were highlighted in the GO analysis in RER-susceptible horses with a notable increase
  in expression of proteins and decrease in expression of genes related to oxidative
  metabolism, amino acid, and polysaccharide metabolism. DEG in sarcoplasmic reticulum
  calcium (CA) transport included downregulation of the dihydropyridine receptor (CACNA2D1)
  and fast twitch calsequestrin (CASQ1) and upregulation of slow twitch CASQ2. There
  was no DEP related to calcium regulation in RER-susceptible versus control horses.
