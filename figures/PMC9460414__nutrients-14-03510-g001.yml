caption: 'Biological fate of ingested plant-derived (poly)phenols and their metabolic
  outcomes. Schematic diagram summarizes the main metabolic outcomes promoted by in
  vivo administration of: (1) capsaicin, (2) resveratrol, (3) epigallocatechin-3-gallate,
  and (4) quercetin. Despite their limited absorption and low bioavailability, these
  compounds consistently improve diverse metabolic outcomes. On the other hand, they
  also modulate the colon microbiota, albeit the currently available data do not support
  yet whether such modulation is a feasible mechanism of action for their metabolic
  properties. HDL, high-density lipoprotein; LDL, low-density lipoprotein; VLDL, very-low-density
  lipoprotein; GLU, blood glucose; INS, insulin; DNL, de novo lipogenesis, TAG, triacylglycerols;
  SBP, systolic blood pressure; DBP, diastolic blood pressure; MBP, mean blood pressure;
  WAT, white adipose tissue; BW, body weight. The arrows imply the kinetics routes;
  question mark (?) implies lack of consistent data to implicate the respective pathway
  in the displayed metabolic outcomes. The diagram has been created with BioRender.com.'
