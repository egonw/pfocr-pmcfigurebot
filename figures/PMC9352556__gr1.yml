caption: Model for localization and regulation of Pah1 by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.
  Unphosphorylated Pah1 in the cytosol is unstable but stabilized through its phosphorylation
  by multiple protein kinases. The phosphorylated Pah1 translocates to the nuclear/ER
  membrane through its recruitment and dephosphorylation by the Nem1-Spo7 protein
  phosphatase complex. Dephosphorylated Pah1, which is associated with the membrane,
  catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidate (PA) to diacylglycerol (DAG) for the synthesis
  of triacylglycerol (TAG) stored in lipid droplets. Dephosphorylated Pah1 or PKC-phosphorylated
  Pah1 lacking phosphorylation by Pho85-Pho80/Cdc28-cyclin B is susceptible to degradation
  by the proteasome (indicated by the dashed line arrows and ellipse). The phosphatidate
  phosphatase substrate PA is also converted to CDP-DAG for the synthesis of the membrane
  phospholipids phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine,
  phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol, and cardiolipin. The phosphatidate phosphatase
  product DAG is also used for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine
  via the Kennedy pathway. Further details for the yeast phospholipid synthetic pathways
  can be found elsewhere (, , , , ).
