caption: Metabolic ROS control is necessary to preserve HSC quiescence. Quiescent
  HSCs depend on glycolysis and exhibit low ROS level, whereas active HSCs instead
  increase proliferation and differentiation while switching to OXPHOS metabolism
  with high ROS production. ROS levels heavily influences HSC fate, thus antioxidant
  enzyme [SOD2, Mgst1, and NRF2] and redirection of cellular metabolism (fueling glucose
  metabolites into the PPP, instead of OXPHOS) maintain low the level of ROS in quiescent
  HSCs. HSC = hematopoietic stem cell; Mgst1 = microsomal glutathione transferase
  1; NRF2 = nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; OXPHOS = oxidative phosphorylation;
  PPP = pentose phosphate pathway; ROS = reactive oxygen species ; SOD2 = superoxide
  dismutase.
