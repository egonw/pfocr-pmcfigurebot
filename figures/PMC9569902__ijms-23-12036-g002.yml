caption: RAI14 knockdown inhibited the cell proliferation, migration and invasion
  of melanoma cells. (A,B) The knockdown efficiency of RAI14 was detected by Western
  blot and qRT-PCR. (C) Cell viability was detected by MTT assay after knockdown of
  RAI14. (D) Microscopic observation and cell-counting assays were used to detect
  the proliferation of melanoma cells. Scale bar = 50 μm. (E) DNA synthesis capacity
  was examined by BrdU assay after RAI14 was knocked down. Scale bar = 50 μm. (F)
  Flow cytometry assays were performed to detect the effect of RAI14-knockdown on
  the cell cycle. (G) The expression of G1 cell-cycle regulatory protein was detected
  after RAI14 knockdown. (H,J) Transwell assay was performed to detect the effect
  of RAI14 knockdown on cell migration and invasion. Scale bar = 50 μm. (I) The effects
  of RAI14 knockdown on the mRNA expression levels of cell-cycle-related genes and
  EMT-related genes were investigated by qPCR experiments. (K) EMT related-proteins
  were detected in RAI14 knockdown cells and control cells. The data were expressed
  as mean ± SD. Student’s t test and One-way ANOVA were performed to analyze significance.
