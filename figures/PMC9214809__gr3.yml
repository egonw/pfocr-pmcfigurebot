caption: Effect of seladelpar on the FXR pathway in primary mouse hepatocytes. Primary
  mouse hepatocytes were treated with either seladelpar (10 μM) or the FXR agonist
  GW4064 (10 μM) in combination with either DMSO or the FXR antagonist DY268 (10 μM)
  for 48 h, and gene expression analysis was performed. Data are presented as mean ±
  S.E.M. of at least three independent replicates. ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01 denote
  the significant difference between control and seladelpar or GW4064 in each condition.
  FXR, Farnesoid X receptor.
article_title: Selective PPARδ agonist seladelpar suppresses bile acid synthesis by
  reducing hepatocyte CYP7A1 via the fibroblast growth factor 21 signaling pathway.
