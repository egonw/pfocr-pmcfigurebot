figure_title: SV did not affect β-catenin in the dentate gyrus granule cell layer
caption: β-catenin immunofluorescence staining in the mouse hippocampus was quantified
  in the granule cell layer (white boxes in right top panel) shown on the confocal
  images (left panels). Fine β-catenin-immunostained punctate structures were localized
  in the neuropil surrounding the granule cells in WT controls (arrows, left panels);
  structures that were significantly less intensely labeled in APP mice. SV treatment
  (timeline shown on top of bar graph) had no effect as analyzed by MetaMorph software
  (bottom at right panel). ***p < 0.001, using two-way ANOVA followed by Newman–Keuls
  post-hoc test. Bar = 200 µm.
