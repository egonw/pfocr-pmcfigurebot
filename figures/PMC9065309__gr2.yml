caption: Opposing metabolic profiles of BAT and WAT in Adipo-Pgam1 KO mice(A) Relative
  change of transcripts (each n = 4, 4) and the tissue weight-adjusted metabolite
  level (each n = 5, 5) in glycolytic pathway in BAT and gWAT from Adipo-Pgam1 KO
  mice.(B) Relative change of transcripts (each n = 4, 4) and the tissue weight-adjusted
  metabolite level (each n = 5, 5) in TCA cycle in BAT (left) and gWAT (right) from
  Adipo-Pgam1 KO mice.(C) Relative change of transcripts (each n = 4, 4) and the tissue
  weight-adjusted metabolite level (each n = 5, 5) in oxidative phosphorylation in
  BAT and gWAT from Adipo-Pgam1 KO mice. Data were analyzed by the 2-tailed Student’s
  t test (A, B and C). ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01. Values represent the mean ± SEM NS =
  not significant. See also  and .
