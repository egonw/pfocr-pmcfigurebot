figure_title: TGR5 activation blocks cGAS-STING-mediated inflammatory response and
  alleviates retinal injury in DR rats
caption: 'A Flowchart of the in vivo experimental procedures. B Representative images
  of EB staining and bar graph showing retinal vascular leakage in rats (n = 3). C
  Representative immunohistochemistry analysis showing VEGF and 8-OHdG expressions
  in rat retinal sections. Scale bars = 50 μm. D Representative immunofluorescence
  images showing expression of GFAP in rat retinal sections. Blue=DAPI. Scale bars = 25 μm.
  E Representative immunofluorescence images showing co-localization of TGR5 (green)
  and GS (red) in rat retinal sections. Blue=DAPI; yellow=merge. Scale bars = 25 μm.
  F Representative western blot showing IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-β protein levels in rat
  retinas (n = 3). G Representative western blot showing GRP75 protein level in rat
  retinas (n = 3). H Representative western blot showing cGAS, p-STING, and STING
  protein levels in rat retinas (n = 3). Data are shown as mean ± SD, *p < 0.05 versus
  control (Ctrl) group, #p < 0.05 versus diabetic (STZ) group.'
