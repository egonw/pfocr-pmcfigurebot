caption: ZCCHC14 regulates P38 signalling pathway proteins and downstream molecules
  in vitro. Immunoblotting analysis was used to determine expression of ZCCHC14, P38,
  p‐P38, cyclinD1 and MMP7 after cells were transfected with a negative control plasmid
  (NC), ZCCCHC14‐KO plasmids, and/or P38 pathway inhibitor doramapimod. Data of P38
  signalling pathway proteins and downstream molecules are shown as bar graphs depicting
  mean ± SD. Experiments were repeated three times
article_title: ZCCHC14 regulates proliferation and invasion of non–small cell lung
  cancer through the MAPK‐P38 signalling pathway.
