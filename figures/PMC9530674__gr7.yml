caption: LCA inhibited H-L-HFD-induced liver fibrosis through regulating insulin resistance
  signaling pathway. Mice were divided into 4 groups, H-L + HFD, H-L + HFD + INSR
  inhibitor, H-L + HFD + INSR inhibitor + LCA and H-L + HFD + INSR inhibitor + IA.
  Liver tissues were collected at 5th week post HFD synergizes H-L radiation or LCA
  or IA setting. A. Timeline of mice subjected to H-L + HFD, H-L + HFD + INSR inhibitor,
  H-L + HFD + INSR inhibitor + LCA and H-L + HFD + INSR inhibitor + IA. B. AST level.
  C. ALT level. D. TC level. E. TG level. F. LDL level. G. HDL level. H. Immunohistochemistry
  detection for PI3K, Akt and NFkB in liver tissues. Scale bar:50 μm. I. Western blot
  analysis (and J. quantification) of effect of LCA (50 mg/kg) on liver fibrosis-related
  proteins, E-cadherin, N-cadherin a-SMA expression in mice. K. Quantification of
  liver inflammation-related mRNA expression. L. E-cadherin, N-cadherin and a-SMA
  mRNA expression in mice liver tissues with or without radiation and IA treatment
  were detected by qRT-PCR. M. E-cadherin, N-cadherin and a-SMA mRNA expression in
  mice lung tissues with or without radiation and IA treatment were detected by qRT-PCR.
  Data are means ± standard deviation (SD). Mann-Whitney test or two-tailed unpaired
  Student's t-test were used for statistical analyses*p < 0.05 indicates significant
  difference.
