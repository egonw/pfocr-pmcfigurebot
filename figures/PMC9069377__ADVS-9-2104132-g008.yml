caption: GPR54 promotes LLC tumor development and increases CD8+ T cell exhaustion.
  A) GPR54 mRNA expression level data was extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
  lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) dataset using Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis
  (GEPIA) Cancer Genomics Browser. GPR54 expression levels between human LUAD tissues
  (n = 483) and adjacent normal tissues (n = 59) was compared. B) Kaplan–Meier survival
  analysis showed that high GPR54 (KISS1R) expression levels significantly correlated
  with poor overall survival of patients with LUAD. C) Scatter plots were generated
  using the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER2.0) web tool of EPIC algorithm
  to identity CD8+ T cell infiltration that was associated with GPR54 (KISS1R) expression
  levels in LUAD of TCGA database. D) Gpr54 +/+ and Gpr54 −/− mice were implanted
  with 106 LLC tumor cells by a subcutaneous injection. The LLC tumor growth curves
  and the end‐point tumor sizes were represented (n = 7). FCM analysis of the proportions
  of E) tumor CD45+, F) CD8+, G) LAG‐3+ CD8+, H) PD‐1+ CD8+, and I) CD4+ cell populations
  at the tumor end‐point (n = 5). All data are from at least three independent experiments.
  Data are represented as the mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 by an
  unpaired Student's t‐test or log(rank) test (B).
