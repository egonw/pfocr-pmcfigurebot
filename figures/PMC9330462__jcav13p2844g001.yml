caption: Expression of LINC00460 in RCC tissues based on the data from the GEPIA and
  TCGA. (A, B) Expression level of LINC00460 in KIRP tissues (n=286) and normal tissues
  (n=60), KIRC tissues (n=523) and normal tissues (n=100), analyzed in TGCA database
  (fold change>2.0, * p<0.05). (C) LINC00460 was gradually elevated with advanced
  staging in RCC. (D, E) OS and DFS rate of RCC patients with lowly or highly LINC00460
  analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier analyses and log-rank test.

  cell carcinoma via PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
