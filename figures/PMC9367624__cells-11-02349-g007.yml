caption: Yoda1 induced hyperpolarization of the transmembrane potential in PAECs.
  Piezo1 activation changed transmembrane potential. (A) Typical traces of the FLIPR
  fluorescence were recorded in freshly isolated vascular cells stimulated with Yoda1
  (20 μM) (black line). Dash lines represent [Ca2+]i increase recorded simultaneously
  with the Cal520 fluorescent probe. Yoda1 (A1) hyperpolarized PAECs. This hyperpolarization
  was reduced by the application of apamin (1 mM), then apamin plus TEA (2 mM), and
  inhibitors of calcium-dependent potassium channels (A2). By contrast, Yoda1 depolarized
  PASMCs (A3) or could sometimes have a biphasic response (A4). (B) Statistical analysis
  of the membrane potential variation induced by Yoda1 (20 μM) in freshly isolated
  PAECs from Nx and 1W-CH IPA. The decrease in FLIRP fluorescence in the presence
  of Yoda1 was reversed by the combination of apamin (1 µM) plus TEA (2 mM). (C) Statistical
  analysis of the membrane potential variation induced by Yoda1 (20 μM) in freshly
  isolated PASMCs from Nx and 1W-CH IPA. As the control, KCl solution (80 mM) was
  applied to measure strong depolarization. For statistical analysis, antagonists
  (apamin and TEA) were preincubated before Yoda1 application and not after, as for
  A. * p  <  0.05. n represented the number of analyzed cells, five different rats
  at least.
