figure_title: The oncogenic role of RHBDL2 in PC cells is dependent upon its intramembrane
  serine protease cleavage activity and the deubiquitinase function of OTUD7B
caption: 'CCK-8 (A), colony formation (B), and EdU (scale bar: 50 μm) (C) assays were
  performed to determine the proliferation capacity in PC cells. The migration and
  invasion abilities of the indicated PC cells were evaluated by wound healing (scale
  bar: 100 μm) (D) and Transwell assays (scale bar: 50 μm) (E). F, G qRT-PCR and Western
  blot analyses of the Notch signaling pathway downstream target genes (HES1, HEY1,
  ZEB1, MMP9, SNAIL1, and TWIST1) and cleaved Notch1 in the indicated PC cells. (H)
  Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay of the indicated PC cells. *P < 0.05.'
article_title: RHBDL2 promotes the proliferation, migration, and invasion of pancreatic
  cancer by stabilizing the N1ICD via the OTUD7B and activating the Notch signaling
  pathway.
