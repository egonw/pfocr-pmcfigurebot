  biosynthetic precursors
caption: 'AThe proportions of the major acyl chain species of PA and PI in BMDMs,
  HEK293 and MCF7; values were calibrated using the data presented in Fig  and . Data
  are represented as mean ± SD (n = 3) from a single experiment, typical of at least
  three performed.BThe proportions of different acyl chain species of CDP‐DG in HEK293
  and MCF7 (uncalibrated). Data are represented as mean ± SEM of biological replicates
  (n = 4).CThe proportions of different acyl chain species of DG in HEK293 and MCF7;
  values were calibrated using the data presented in Fig . Data are represented as
  mean ± SEM of biological replicates (n = 3).DBiosynthetic pathway for synthesis
