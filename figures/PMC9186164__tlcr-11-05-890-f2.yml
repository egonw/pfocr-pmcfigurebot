caption: Association of combined FOXP1 and RORA genotypes with NSCLC survival and
  prediction model established by ROC curve. (A) OS survival curves by the combined
  NUG and (B) two groups according to NUG in the PLCO dataset; (C) DSS survival curves
  for the combined NUG and (D) two groups according to NUG in the PLCO dataset. (E)
  OS and (G) DSS time-dependent AUC analysis based on age, sex, smoking status, histology,
  tumor stage, chemotherapy, surgery, principal component and the NUG; (F) 5-year
  OS and (H) 5-year DSS evaluated by ROC curve. NUG, number of unfavorable genotypes
  (FOXP1 rs2568847 GC + CC and RORA rs922782 TT); ROC, receiver operating characteristic
  AUC, area under the curve; OS, overall survival; DSS, disease-special survival;
  NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer; NUG, number of unfavorable genotypes; PLCO, The
  Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial.
