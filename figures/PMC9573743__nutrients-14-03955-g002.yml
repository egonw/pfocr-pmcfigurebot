caption: 'TMAO promoted osteoclast differentiation and resorption. (A,B) TMAO promoted
  TRAP-positive osteoclast formation in a dose-dependent manner. Scale bar = 20 µm.
  BMMs were cultured in α-MEM containing 30 ng/mL M-CSF and 100 ng/mL RANKL under
  different concentrations of TMAO for 4 days. Osteoclasts were stained by a TRAP
  staining kit. TRAP-positive osteoclasts were observed and counted by open-field
  microscopy. (C,D) TMAO increased F-actin ring formation in a dose-dependent manner.
  Scale bar = 200 µm. BMMs were cultured in α-MEM containing 30 ng/mL M-CSF and 100
  ng/mL RANKL under different concentrations of TMAO for 4 days. The cells were stained
  with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin for 60 min and then stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
  for 5 min. Then the F-actin rings were observed by a fluorescence microscope. (E,F)
  TMAO increased bone resorption area in a dose-dependent manner. Scale bar = 50 µm.
  BMMs were seeded on the sterilized bovine bone slices and treated with different
  concentrations of TMAO for two weeks. The bone resorption area was observed under
  a scanning electron microscope. #p < 0.01.'
