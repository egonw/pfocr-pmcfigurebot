caption: Regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and MAPK pathway by lncRNAs
  and the crosstalk between the pathways. DANCR recruit FRAT1 and FRAT2 to negatively
  regulate GSK-3, which inhibits the accumulation of β-catenin and its translocation
  to the nucleus. LncRNA GHET positively regulates PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which in
  turn targets GSK-3 and regulates Wnt/β-catenin pathway
