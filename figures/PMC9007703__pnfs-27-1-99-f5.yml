caption: Effect of Gryllus bimaculatus water extract on mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) phosphoryla-tion (A), phospho-IκBα, IκBα (B), and phospho nuclear
  factor (NF)-κB p65 (C) levels in RAW 264.7 cells. Cells were treated with lipopolysaccha-ride
  (LPS, 0.2 μg/mL) only and with G. bimaculatus extract at concentrations of 250 and
  500 μg/mL for 30 min (A) and 3 h (B and C). Cell lysates were subjected to western
  blot analysis using specific MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathway anti-bodies. ERK,
  extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase.
