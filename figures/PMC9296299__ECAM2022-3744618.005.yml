caption: PNS inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition through the MAKP signaling
  pathway. To study the expression level of the MAPK signal pathway under different
  time conditions stimulated by TGF-β1 (a). ∗P < 0.05. ∗∗P < 0.01. ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs
  no TGF-β1 added. (b) Next, 72 hours was selected as the stimulation time of TGF-β1,
  and Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression of p38, p-p38, Erk,
  p-Erk, JNK, and p-JNK related signaling molecules in the MAPK signaling pathway.
  ∗P < 0.01. ∗∗P < 0.001 vs. Control group. ＃P < 0.05. ＃＃P < 0.01. ＃＃＃P < 0.001 vs.
  TGF-β1 group. (c) Then select immunofluorescence technology to further detect the
  fluorescence of p-p38, p-Erk, and p-JNK signaling molecules related to the MAPK
  signaling pathway (magnification, ×500). (d) After adding 3 kinds of MAPK signal
  pathway inhibitors (SB203580/PD98059/SP600125), Western blotting was used to detect
  E-cad, FN, and Vim protein related to EMT. ∗P < 0.05. ∗∗P < 0.01. ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs.
  Control group. ＃P < 0.05. ＃＃P < 0.01. ＃＃＃P < 0.001 vs. TGF-β1 group.
