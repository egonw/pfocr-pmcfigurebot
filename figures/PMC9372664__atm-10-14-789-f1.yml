caption: 'Rha restored cell proliferation of DHEA-treated KGN cells. (A) TGF-β1, α-SMA,
  and Collagen I levels in KGN cells followed by treatment with DHEA at various concentrations
  (10 nM, 100 nM, 1 µM, 10 µM, 100 µM) assessed using Western blot. (B) Cell viability
  was measured with CCK-8 after DHEA and different dosage of Rha treatment. (C) KGN
  cell proliferation was assessed via EdU assay after DHEA and different dosage of
  Rha treatment. n=3. Data are exhibited as mean ± SD. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001
  vs. control group; #P<0.05, ##P<0.01 vs. DHEA group. TGF-β1, transforming growth
  factor-β1; DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone; CCK-8, cell counting kit-8; EdU, 5-ethynyul-2’-deoxyuridine;
  SD, standard deviation; OD, optical density.'
