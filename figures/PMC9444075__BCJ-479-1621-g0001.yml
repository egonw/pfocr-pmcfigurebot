figure_title: Interactions between inflammatory signals and cell death programmes
  can enhance both
caption: Acute inflammation is a healthy response to danger signals such as, trauma,
  stress, or infection. An inflammatory stimuli can prompt several outcomes for a
  cell. Most often the response will be survival signalling, which enhances the expression
  of proteins associated with proliferation and inflammation. In some circumstances,
  an inflammatory stimulus may initiate a cell death pathway. Apoptosis is typically
  non-inflammatory, and an important part of the resolution of acute inflammation
  in a tissue, however, apoptotic cells will proceed to late apoptosis when phagocytic
  clearance (efferocytosis) is delayed. Other lytic forms of programmed cell death,
  including necroptosis, pyroptosis, NETosis and ferroptosis, are thought to promote
  inflammation by releasing damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), and other
  inflammatory mediators, into the extracellular environment. Inflammatory amplification
  loops play a physiological role in acute tissue inflammation in order to generate
  adequate tissue and immune responses. Lytic forms of cell death, including late
  apoptosis, can further enhance inflammatory amplification loops. Once an insult
  is dealt with, the resolution of inflammation is vital to restore cellular and tissue
  homeostasis. Excess inflammatory signalling can lead to ongoing amplification cycles
  that fail to resolve, resulting in chronic inflammation, enhanced cell death, tissue
  pathology and disease.
