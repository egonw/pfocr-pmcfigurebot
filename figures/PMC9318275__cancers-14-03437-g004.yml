caption: ALDH1A1 inhibition suppresses pathways involved in chemoresistance and stemness.
  RNA-seq was performed on OVCAR3 cells treated with compound 974 (5 ÂµM for 48 h)
  or DMSO (n = 3). (A) Volcano plot of genes up and downregulated by ALDH1A1 inhibition.
  (B) Heatmap of selected genes significantly downregulated by compound 974 (FDR <
  0.05). (C) Networks of biological processes constructed using significantly altered
  genes (FDR < 0.05) between OVCAR3 cells treated with 974 or DMSO. (D) Canonical
  pathways related to stemness and chemoresistance identified by the Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis (IPA) using genes significantly altered by 974 treatment (FDR < 0.05, fold
  change > |1.5|).
