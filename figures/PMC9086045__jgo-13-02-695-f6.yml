caption: Silencing IL-6R attenuates the regulation of IL-6R/STAT3 by miRNA-320. (A)
  IL-6R, STAT3, and p-STAT3 protein expression in DLD1 cells transfected with LV-anti-miRNA-320
  in the presence or absence of IL-6R siRNA was analyzed by Western blot. (B) mRNA
  levels of IL-6R and STAT3 were evaluated by qPCR in DLD1 cells transfected with
  LV-anti-miRNA-320 in the presence or absence of IL-6R. (C) Expression of BCL-xl
  and PCNA proteins in DLD1 cells transfected with LV-anti-miRNA-320 in the presence
  or absence of IL-6R siRNA was analyzed by Western blot. Data are expressed as the
  mean ± SD. A “+” means existence, and a “−” means not present. ***, P<0.001. IL-6R,
  interleukin-6 receptor; LV, lentiviral vector; STAT3, signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3; miRNA, microRNA; p-STAT3, phosphorylated-signal transducer and
  activator of transcription 3; mRNA, messenger RNA; qPCR, quantitative real-time
  polymerase chain reaction; BCL-xl, B-cell lymphoma-extra large; PCNA, proliferating
  cell nuclear antigen; siRNA, small-interfering RNA; GAPDH, Glyseraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; SD, standard deviation.
