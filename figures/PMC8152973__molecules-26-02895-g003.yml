caption: Results of KEGG pathway mapping. 2-fold changed DEGs were analyzed using
  the KEGG pathway database. 24, 22, and 22 DEGs were included in cell cycle, MAPK
  signaling, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways, respectively. AS-IV showed down-regulatory
  effects on these pathways. Only a few DEGs were up-regulated in these three pathways.
  MAPK signaling and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways were upstream of the cell cycle pathway.
  The red and blue color in the figure indicate up-regulation and down-regulation
  of genes, respectively. Intensity of color is proportional to fold change.
