caption: 'Transcriptomes of PKCi-mESC and 2i-mESC are significantly different. A.
  Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between PKCi-mESC and 2i-mESC.
  B. Heatmap comparing transcription levels of core transcription factors in PKCi-mESC
  and 2i-mESC. The expression level of Pou5f1 was significantly (FC > 2) increased
  in PKCi-mESC, but Sox2 and Nanog expression were higher in 2i-mESC. C. Heatmap comparing
  transcription levels of na√Øve-specific markers in PKCi-mESC and 2i-mESC. Klf17,
  Dnmt3l and Rex1 genes were highly expressed in PKCi-mESC, whereas Fgf4, Klf4, Tbx3
  and Dppa5a genes are highly expressed in 2i-mESC. D. Heatmap comparing transcription
  levels of pluripotency gene in PKCi and 2i. c-Myc and Lin28a were highly expressed
  in PKCi. E. Heatmap comparing transcription levels of primed-specific markers gene
  in PKCi-mESC and 2i-mESC. Zic2, Sfrp2, Otx2, and Fgf5 were highly expressed in PKCi-mESC,
  whereas Stc1 and Hmx2 were highly expressed in 2i-mESC. F. Heatmap comparing transcription
  levels of DEGs between PKCi-mESC and 2i-mESC which were enriched by KEGG clustering
  analysis. The DEGs were enriched in Wnt, MAPK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways, and
  were lowly expressed in PKCi-mESC. The DEGs were enriched in Chemokine, Focal adhesion,
  and ECM-recenter interaction signaling pathway, and were highly expressed in PKCi-mESC.
