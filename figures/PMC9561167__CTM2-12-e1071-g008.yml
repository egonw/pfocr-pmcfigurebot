caption: 'Ovulation stimulates the activation of primordial follicle through mTOR
  signalling pathway. Mice were superovulated by pregnant mare serum gonadotropin
  (PMSG) and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) treatment and ovaries were collected
  at indicated time points [negative control (NC), PMSG 48 h, HCG 10 h, HCG 12 h,
  HCG 14 h, HCG 18 h]. (A) Immunostaining of FOXO3a in primordial follicles at PMSG
  48 h, HCG 12 h and HCG 18 h. FOXO3a shuttled from nuclei to cytoplasm with follicular
  activation. Black frame: representative magnified image with primordial follicles.
  (B) Percentage of activated primordial follicles at different time points in ovaries
  (NC, PMSG 48 h, HCG 10 h, HCG 12 h, HCG 14 h, HCG 18 h). (C) Blockage of p‐RPS6
  (Ser235/236) by mTOR‐specific inhibitor rapamycin (Rapa) treatment. The expression
  of β‐tubulin was used as internal control. (D) Immunostaining of FOXO3a in primordial
  follicles in control and rapamycin‐treated ovaries. (E) Percentage of activated
  primordial follicles in control and rapamycin‐treated ovaries. (F) Immunofluorescence
  of α‐tubulin on spindle of MII oocytes in control and rapamycin group. Scale bars:
  20 μm. (G) Representative two‐cell embryos after in vitro fertilisation (IVF). (H)
  Immunostaining of FOXO3a in primordial follicles under natural ovulation. Red square:
  ovulation site; black square: non‐ovulation site; NCL: new corpus luteum. Data represent
  the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of biological triplicate experiments. **p < .01,
  by one‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis. Scale bars: 50 μm'
