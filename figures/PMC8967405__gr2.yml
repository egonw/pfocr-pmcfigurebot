caption: Stress tolerance and gene expression are enhanced in UCP1ox plants through
  ERFVII substrates of the PCO N-degron pathway(A) Root tip survival in response to
  hypoxia.(B) Seedling survival following growth on media containing NaCl (125 mM).(C)
  Images of plants irrigated with 150 mM NaCl for 3 weeks.(D) Conductivity (electrolyte
  leakage) of mature leaves collected from plants watered with 150 mM NaCl or water
  for 1 week.(E) Relative expression of transcripts for ADH1, PGB1, and CML38 in 7-day-old
  seedlings and mature leaves.(F) Relative ADH1 transcript levels in control (1 h
  dark) and treated (1 h submerged+dark) seedlings for WT, mutants, and UCP1ox combinations.(G)
  Root tip survival in response to hypoxia (Col-0 shown in A).Error bars indicate
  SD; letters one-way ANOVA. See also .
