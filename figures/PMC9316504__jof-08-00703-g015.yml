caption: Change of glucose metabolic pathway in SCGFA mutant. SCGFA GPD2Δ FPS1Δ ADH2Δ
  was constructed by the GPD2, FPS1, and ADH2 deletion using the CRISPR-Cas9 approach.
  The yield of ethanol was increased in SCGFA with the content decrease of the by-products
  of glycerol, lactic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, and CO2.
