caption: 'Artemisinin attenuated OGD/RP-induced loss of cell viability and cytotoxicity
  in PC12 cells. (A) Structure of artemisinin. (B) Cells were treated with different
  durations of OGD followed by reperfusion and cell viability was measured using MTT
  assay, ***p< 0.001 were considered significantly different; (C) Cells were pretreated
  with different concentrations of artemisinin and then incubated with OGD for 4 hours
  followed by 20 hours of reperfusion and cell viability was measured using MTT assay.
  (D) Cells were pretreated with different concentrations of artemisinin and then
  incubated with OGD for 4 hours followed by 20 hours of reperfusion and the cytotoxicity
  was measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. The percentage was calculated
  by the ratio of the optical density (OD) values compared with ctrl group. (E) Cells
  were pretreated with artemisinin at the indicated concentrations and then subjected
  to OGD/RP conditions. Representative images of Hoechst 33342 staining. Scale bar:
  100 μm. (F) Quantitative analysis of Hoechst 33342 staining. (G) Cells were pretreated
  with 25 μM artemisinin and then subjected to OGD/RP. Representative images of Annexin
  V-FITC/PI staining detected by flow cytometry. (H) Quantitative analysis of Annexin
  V-FITC/PI staining. (I) Cells pretreated with 25 μM artemisinin and then subjected
  to OGD/RP. The activity of caspase 3 was measured by caspase 3 activity assay. (J)
  Cells pretreated with 12.5 μM, 25 μM, 50 μM artemisinin and then subjected to OGD/RP.
  The expression level of caspase 3 (green) was detected by immunofluorescence. Scale
  bar: 150 μm. ***p < 0.001, versus ctrl group; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001,
  versus model group were considered significantly different. The assay was repeated
  at least 3 times.'
