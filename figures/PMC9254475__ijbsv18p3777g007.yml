caption: LncRNA HOXA10-AS is negatively correlated with the expression of hsa-miR-340-3p
  and positively correlated with the expression of HTR1D in pancreatic cancer. a The
  venn diagram for the intersection of the upstream regulatory LncRNAs of hsa-miR-340-3p
  predicted by Lncbaset database and the differentially expressed LncRNAs calculated
  by different R packages in TCGA liver cancer samples. b-c The expression difference
  and survival analysis curve of LncRNA HOXA10-AS using RStudio based on the bioinformatics
  analysis of TCGA data. d-e Correlation analysis of the expression of HTR1D/hsa-miR-340-3p/HOXA10-AS
  in TCGA pancreatic cancer samples. f The mRNA expression level of LncRNA HOXA10-AS
  was detected by qPCR in PANC-1 and CFPAC-1. g-h The dual luciferase reporter gene
  assay was performed to verify the interaction between LncRNA HOXA10-AS and hsa-miR-340-3p.
  i-j The effect of decreasing LncRNA HOXA10-AS on the expression level of HTR1D and
  hsa-miR-340-3p in each cell line by qPCR. k-l Western blot was performed to detect
  designated proteins in each cell line transfected with specific plasmids. Each experiment
  was performed three times independently and results are presented as mean Â± s.d.
  Student's t-test was used to analyze the data. (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001)
article_title: HTR1D functions as a key target of HOXA10-AS/miR-340-3p axis to promote
  the malignant outcome of pancreatic cancer via PI3K-AKT signaling pathway.
