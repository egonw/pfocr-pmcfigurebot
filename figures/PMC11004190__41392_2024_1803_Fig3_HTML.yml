caption: a Schematic representation of GPCR activation process. Upon agonist (red
  circle) binding, the receptor proceeds into a pre-activation state coupling with
  the G protein heterotrimer, where the exchange of GDP and GTP in G protein Î± subunit
  leads to G protein dissociation and mediate G protein signaling pathway. The phosphorylation
  of the receptor C-terminal tail by GRK binding promotes arrestin recruitment and
  signaling. When the antagonists (blue circle) bind, the receptor stabilizes in an
  inactive state. b Crosstalk of downstream pathway of Gs, Gq, Gi and arrestin
