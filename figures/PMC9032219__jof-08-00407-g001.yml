caption: 'Scheme of the lovastatin gene cluster and biosynthetic pathway. (A) Lovastatin
  gene cluster in Aspergillus terreus. Genes marked in red are required for the synthesis
  of MJ. (B) Lovastatin acid and simvastatin acid biosynthetic pathway. LovB (lovastatin
  nonaketide synthase, LNKS) and LovC, combined with LovG, are responsible for the
  synthesis of dihydromonacolin L (DML); then, DML was modified by LovA through continuous
  two-step oxidization to produce monacolin L (ML) and monacolin J (MJ). The α-methylbutyryl
  side chain is synthesized by LovF (lovastatin diketosynthase, LDKS) and is transferred
  to MJ by LovD to produce lovastatin (LV) acid. LovD could also catalyze MJ with
  an acyl donor DMB-SMMP to produce simvastatin. SAM: S-adenosyl-L-methionine, DMB-S-MMP:
  α-dimethylbutyryl-S-methyl-mercaptopropionate.'
