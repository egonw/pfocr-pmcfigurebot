caption: The kallikrein-kinin system links coagulation and inflammation in COVID-19.The
  metabolic pathway of bradykinin, Lys-bradykinin and their metabolites. Severe acute
  respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes downregulation and functional
  deficiency of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which could impair the degradation
  of kinin peptides that act on bradykinin receptor 1. Excessive activation of bradykinin
  receptor 1 results in both hyperinflammatory responses and pulmonary edema, whereas
  factor XII (FXII) activation leads to coagulation activation and provides a feedback
  loop with activation of the kallikrein-kinin pathway. Aprotinin inhibits plasma
  and tissue kallikrein, in addition to its in vitro observed antiviral actions. ACE
  indicates angiotensin-converting enzyme; C-peptidase, carboxypeptidase; IL-1, interleukin-1;
  N-peptidase, aminopeptidase; TNFÎ±, tumor necrosis factor alpha. This figure was
  created with BioRender.
