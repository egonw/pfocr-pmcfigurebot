caption: 'Baicalein triggered ERS in GC cells to induce apoptosis by activating BTG3.
  A, B BTG3 mRNA and protein expression determined by RT-qPCR and Western blot; C Expression
  levels of Grp78 and CHOP determined by Western blot; D Intracellular Ca2 + levels
  measured by Fluo-3 AM fluorescent probes; E: Intercellular Ca2 + levels measured
  by flow cytometry; F: Apoptosis assessed by flow cytometry. Cell experiment was
  repeated thrice, and the data were showed as mean ± SD. One-way ANOVA was employed
  for comparisons among multiple groups, followed by Tukey’s test. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001'
