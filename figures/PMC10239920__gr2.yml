caption: 'Comparison of pathways altered by glucocorticoids in patients with SRNS
  vs. patients with SSNS using a “patient-specific” analysis of integrated omics.
  Chord plot represents pathways that were significantly perturbed (P < 0.05) by joint
  pathway analysis for individual patients. R1–R8: 8 patients with SRNS (in red);
  S1–S7: 7 patients with SSNS (in blue). For example, patient R1 had 2 pathways significantly
  perturbed: nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism and mucin type O-glycan biosynthesis.
  For pathway mucin type O-glycan biosynthesis, 3 patients with SRNS (R1, R2, and
  R6) and 5 patients with SSNS (S1, S3, S4, S6, and S7) had this pathway activated.
  The percentages labeled above the pathways are Pathway Group Enrichment Index numbers
  calculated by , which represents the enrichment of a pathway in patients with SRNS
  compared to patients with SSNS. Although a total of 34 KEGG metabolic pathways were
  perturbed in 15 patients, we selected 12 pathways whose Pathway Group Enrichment
  Index was < −25% or >25% to show in this chord plot. TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle.'
