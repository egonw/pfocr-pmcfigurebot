caption: Rnd3 inhibits TGF-β and Notch signaling to regulate fibrotic response under
  HG+PA. (A) Gene ontology analysis of RNA-sequencing data from control and Ad-Rnd3
  cardiac fibroblasts (CFs). (B) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway
  analysis showing major signaling pathways in control and Ad-Rnd3 CFs. (C) Western
  blot analysis of Hes1, NICD, ROCK1, RhoA-GTP, RhoA, and TGF-β1 expression in CFs
  treated as indicated. (D) Quantitative analysis of the protein levels of Hes1, NICD,
  ROCK1, RhoA-GTP, RhoA, and TGF-β1 in CFs treated as indicated (n = 4). *P < 0.05
  vs. Ad-control; †P < 0.05 vs. Ad-Rnd3; ‡P < 0.05 vs. HG+PA+Ad-control. (E) Interaction
  between Rnd3 and NICD demonstrated using co-immunoprecipitation. (F) Co-immunoprecipitation
  and Western blot analysis of ubiquitination level of NICD in different treatment
  groups. (G) Quantitative analysis of the ubiquitination level of NICD in different
  groups (n = 3). *P < 0.05 vs. HG+PA+Ad-control. (H) Interaction between Rnd3 and
  ROCK1 demonstrated using Co-immunoprecipitation.
