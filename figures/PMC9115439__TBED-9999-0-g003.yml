caption: The putative dynamics of host oscillation associated with the origin and
  emergence of the Omicron strain of SARS‐COV‐2. (left) and the phylogeny of the putative
  pathway of differentiation (accumulation of mutations of the S1 protein derived
  from Nextstrain –  www.nextrain.com ) of the variant Omicron (pink area and visual
  regression area in red) compared to the pathway recovered for all lineages of SARS‐COV‐2
  (grey area and regression area in black). We postulate that the differences in the
  pathways between the above lineages are associated to distinct selective regimes,
  likely determined by differences in the ACE2 receptor of different host species.
  (a,b) Colonization of humans from original wildlife host species, directly or by
  steppingstone, resulting in a new population – e.g., the lineage of the 19A strain
  – composed by a limited portion of the genotypic diversity of the precursor of the
  virus (bottleneck, blue curve with short amplitude). (b,c) In humans, the virus
  diversifies under the pressure of the new selection and differentiates (blue curve
  with wide amplitude) from the original ancestral population. (c,d) Subsequent colonization
  of a new unknown host species with associated bottleneck (red curve with narrow
  amplitude) of the newly formed viral population. (d,e) In isolation, the new population
  – i.e., the lineage of the Omicron strain – diversifies under the new host pressure
  (red curve with wide amplitude). (e,f) Recolonization of humans resulting in the
  unique features of the Omicron strain. Background panels represent oscillation among
  putative potential host species of mammals
