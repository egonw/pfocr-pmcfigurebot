caption: FSCN1 activates the YAP/TAZ signaling pathway in prostate cancer cells. (a,
  b) Western blot measured the protein expression level of YAP, p-YAP, n-YAP, and
  TAZ in PC-3 cells in the si-NC, si-FSCN1#1, and si-FSCN1#2 groups, ∗∗P < 0.01 vs
  si-NC; (c, d) western blot detected the protein expression level of YAP, p-YAP,
  n-YAP, and TAZ in DU145 cells in the mock group and the FSCN1 group, ∗∗P < 0.01.
