caption: 'PMA reverses the effect of ROCK2 silencing on the viability, inflammation
  and apoptosis of LPS-induced HK-2 cells. (A) Cell viability was measured using MTT
  assay. (B) LDH production was measured using a commercially available LDH release
  assay kit. (C) Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was utilized to measure the
  mRNA level of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β in HK-2 cells. (D) ELISA was used to determine
  the production of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β. (E) TUNEL staining was utilized to measure
  HK-2 apoptotic rate. ***P<0.001 vs. control; $$P<0.01 and $$$P<0.001 vs. LPS; #P<0.05,
  ##P<0.01 and ###P<0.001 vs. LPS + shRNA-ROCK2; +P<0.05, ++P<0.01 and +++P<0.001
  vs. DMSO + LPS + shRNA-ROCK2. ROCK2, Rho-associated protein kinase 2; LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  sh, short hairpin; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.'
