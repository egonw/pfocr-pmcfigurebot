caption: MAP9 promotes tumor growth in vivo. (a) Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining
  of the T24 xenograft tumors. (b) In vivo imaging technology to monitor the growth
  of T24 xenograft tumors. Xenograft tumors were generated by injecting sh-ctrl or
  sh-MAP9 T24 cells. (c) MAP9 knockdown increased the growth of T24 xenograft tumors.
  Xenograft tumors were generated by injecting sh-ctrl or short hairpin ribonucleic
  acid- (RNA-) MAP9 (sh-MAP9) T24 cells. The growth of the xenograft tumors was determined
  by volume. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD), and paired
  Student's t-test was employed for data analysis. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P
  < 0.001.
