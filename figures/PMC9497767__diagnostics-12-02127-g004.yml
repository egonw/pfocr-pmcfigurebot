caption: ZEB family proteins are sustained by dual positive feedback loops. Activated
  ERK1/2 pathways increase expression of both ZEB1/2 and hyaluronan. ZEB1/2 then downregulate
  ESRP1/2, resulting in expression of FGFRs-IIIc and CD44s isoforms. FGF2/4, abundant
  in stromal tissues, and hyaluronan bind FGFRsIIIc receptors and CD44s, respectively,
  and then provoke the ERK signaling pathway to maintain ZEB1/2 at high levels.
