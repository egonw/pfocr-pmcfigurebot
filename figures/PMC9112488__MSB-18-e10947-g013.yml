figure_title: In‐depth characterization of the human liver proteome
caption: 'Overview of biological material used for generating the liver proteome atlas.
  (hHSC: hepatic stellate cell, hHEP: hepatocyte, hKC: Kupffer cell, hLSEC: liver
  sinusoidal endothelial cell, TWNT4 and LX2: immortalized human hepatic stellate
  cell line, SK‐Hep‐1: human hepatic adenocarcinoma cell line, HepG2: human liver
  cancer cell line). Number of biological replicates is n = 6 for bulk liver, hepatic
  artery and portal vein; n = 3 for hHEP, hLSEC, hHSC, hKC and n = 1 for HepG2, SK‐Hep1,
  LX2 and TWNT4. No additional replications of the experiment was done in laboratory.Total
  quantified proteome depth in tissues (n = 18), primary cells (n = 12), immortalized
  cell lines (n = 4) and all samples (n = 34). In all cases, n means biological replicates
  unless otherwise indicated. The upper and lower panel shows the number of quantified
  protein groups and peptides, respectively.Dynamic range of the different proteomes
  based on median intensity of label‐free quantification (LFQ) ordered by abundance
  rank (Liver: bulk liver biopsy, HepA: hepatic artery, PorV: portal vein, Cell lines:
  mixture of human liver‐derived immortalized cell lines). Number of biological replicates
  is same as Panel (A).Principal component analysis (PCA) of all proteomes based on
  their proteome profiles. For abbreviations, please refer to Panel (A).KEGG pathway
  coverage in this dataset, with major metabolic pathways highlighted.'
