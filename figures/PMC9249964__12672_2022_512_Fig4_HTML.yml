caption: MDM4 is a direct target of miR-1307-5p in bladder cancer cells. A Diagrams
  showing the putative miR-1307-5p binding site of MDM4 locus and corresponding mutant
  sites. B miR-1307-5p effects on luciferase reporters based on wild-type (wt) MDM4
  3′-UTR versus mutant (mt) 3′-UTR. C T24 and 5637 cells that were transfected with
  corresponding miRNA vectors were subjected to RT–qPCR and western blotting for MDM4
  expression. D RT–qPCR and western blotting analyses to compare MDM4 expression in
  xenografts. E An inverse correlation between miR-1307-5p and MDM4 mRNA expression
  in vivo. F RT–qPCR analysis of MDM4 in tumor tissues and matched normal tissues.
  G Inverse correlation between miR-1307-5p and MDM4 expression in -Spearman’s rank
  correlation analysis. **p < 0.01; ****p < 0.0001; ns, no significance. Data depicts
  the mean ± standard deviation and are representative of three independent experiments
