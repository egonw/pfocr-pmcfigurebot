caption: The schematic diagram illustrates that CLP induces the activation of GSDMD
  and subsequently increases Drp1, leading to mitochondrial injury, significant neuronal
  and synaptic damage, and a decrease in neural oscillations in the hippocampus, ultimately
  contributing to cognitive impairments. Notably, inhibiting GSDMD/Drp1 pathway might
  reverse these aberrant changes and ameliorate cognitive deficits in SAE mice

  neural oscillation abnormalities in a mouse model of sepsis-associated encephalopathy.
