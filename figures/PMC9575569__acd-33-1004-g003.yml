caption: Knocking down GNG5 inhibited aerobic glycolysis of breast cancer cells. (a–c)
  Glucose consumption, lactic acid production and ATP production in different groups
  of BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells. (d) WB assay was performed for detecting LDHA and
  HK2 protein expression within BT5490 and MDA-MB-231 cells from diverse groups. *P
  < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. GNG5, G protein subunit gamma 5; WB, Western blot.
article_title: G protein subunit gamma 5 promotes the proliferation, metastasis and
  glycolysis of breast cancer cells through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
