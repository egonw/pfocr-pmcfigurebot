caption: IL‐36γ synergizes and IL‐36Ra inhibits Wnt signaling during colitis and colon
  tumorigenesis. A) GSEA (left) and heatmap (right) of Wnt signaling pathway genes
  in the transcriptome profiles of colon tumors from Il1f9 +/+ (n = 2) and Il1f9 −/−
  (n = 2) mice or from Il1f5 +/+ (n = 2) and Il1f5 −/− (n = 2) mice that were treated
  with AOM/DSS protocol. B) qRT‐PCR analysis of the indicated genes in colon tissues
  from Il1f9 +/+ (n = 8) and Il1f9 −/− (n = 8) mice or Il1f5 +/+ (n = 8) and Il1f5
  −/− (n = 8) that were treated as in (A). C) qRT‐PCR analysis of the indicated genes
  in colon tumors of VP (n = 10) and VP9 (n = 8) or VP (n = 10) and VP5 (n = 12) mice
  that were intraperitoneally injected with AOM (10 mg kg‐1) every week for 6 successive
  weeks and rested for 12–14 weeks. D) Immunoblot analysis of CD44, TCF7 or GAPDH
  in colon tumors from Il1f9 +/+ and Il1f9 −/− (n = 2) mice or from Il1f5 +/+ and
  Il1f5 −/− (n = 2) mice treated as in (A) (left), VP, VP9 or VP5 (n = 2) mice treated
  as in (C) (middle), or 5 month old Apc Min/+, Apc Min/+Il1f5 −/− or Apc Min/+Il1f9
  −/− (n = 2) mice (right). WE, weak exposure; SE, strong exposure. E) qRT‐PCR analysis
  of the indicated genes in colon organoids (n = 4) that were left untreated or stimulated
  with Wnt3a (100 ng mL‐1), IL‐36γ (20 ng mL‐1), IL‐36Ra (20 ng mL‐1), Wnt3a plus
  IL‐36γ, or Wnt3a plus IL‐36Ra for 4 h. F) qRT‐PCR analysis of the indicated genes
  in colon organoids (n = 4) that were left untreated or stimulated with Wnt3a (100 ng mL‐1),
  IL‐36γ (20 ng mL‐1), IL‐36Ra (20 ng mL‐1), Wnt3a plus IL‐36γ, or Wnt3a plus IL‐36Ra
  in the presence or absence of CHX (50 µg mL‐1) for 6 h. ES, enrichment score; NES,
  nonenrichment score; FDR, false discovery rate; FWER, family‐wise error rate. WE,
  weak exposure; SE, strong exposure. n.s., not significant. Graphs show mean ± SEM.
  B,C,E,F) Two‐tailed student's t‐test in B, C, E, F. B–F) Data are representative
  of two independent experiments.
