caption: Advaita iPathway analysis of differentially expressed pathways/genes between
  6 h Egr1KO and 6 h WT LECs. (A) Impact analysis of the DEGs suggest that the KEGG
  pathway map “antigen processing and presentation” (p-value = 4.147 × 10−6) (yellow
  dot) is the most significantly impacted pathway in the 6 h LECs. Other impacted
  KEGG pathways are represented by the other dots with black dots being non-significant
  KEGG pathways and red dots being significant KEGG pathways. (B) Bar graph showing
  the antigen processing and presentation genes that are differentially expressed
  in the 6H Egr1KO LECs. (C) Bar graph showing the cell adhesion molecules (p-value
  = 0.003) pathway of genes differentially expressed in the 6H Egr1KO LECs. (D) Bar
  graph showing the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction (p-value = 0.003) pathway
  of genes differentially expressed in the 6H Egr1KO LECs. (E) Bar graph showing the
  ECM receptor interaction (p-value = 0.045) pathway of genes differentially expressed
  in the 6H Egr1KO LECs.
