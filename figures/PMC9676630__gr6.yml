caption: 'Silencing of TIAM2 can slow tumor growth. A: Western blot showed TIAM2 protein
  levels extracted from shTIAM2 and the control group in 143B cells. B: Quantification
  of the band density ratio of TIAM2 to GAPDH. C: Tumors obtained from nude mice after
  dissection. D: The real-time tumor volume. E: Comparison of tumor weight between
  the two groups. F-G: Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and IHC staining of tumor tissues (400×);
  Assessment of staining intensity by positive cells ratio (F). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.'
