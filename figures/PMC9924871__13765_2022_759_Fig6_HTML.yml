caption: Baicalein effectively prevented GC progression in vivo. A Tumor volume during
  baicalein treatment; B Tumor weight after baicalein treatment; C Immunohistochemical
  staining of Ki67; D Apoptotic cells detected using TUNEL staining; E, F ERS-related
  and BTG3/PI3K/AKT pathway-related proteins detected by Western blot. The data were
  exhibited as mean ± SD. One-way ANOVA was adopted for comparisons among multiple
  groups, followed by Tukey’s test. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p < 0.001
