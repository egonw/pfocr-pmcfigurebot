caption: miR-203a-3p downregulates VEGFA expression and PI3K/AKT signaling in HemECs.
  (A) Design of the WT and MT sequences of VEGFA for luciferase reporter gene assays.
  (B) Comparison of relative luciferase activity among the WT and MT groups after
  miR-203 mimics co-transfection. (C) Comparison of VEGFA mRNA expression levels among
  the groups after the manipulation of miR-203 expression. (D) Detection of the VEGFA
  protein expression by western blotting after the manipulation of miR-203 expression,
  (E) which was semi-quantified. (F) Detection of PI3K and AKT phosphorylation by
  western blot analysis. (G) Semi-quantification of the p-PI3K/PI3K and p-AKT/AKT
  ratios among the groups in HemECs following the manipulation of miR-203 expression.
