caption: Effect of HO-1 inhibitor ZnPP on cell viability and intracellular ROS levels
  in SC-pretreated HT22 cells under glutamate treatment. The HT22 cells were incubated
  with 5 μM ZnPP for 1 h with or without SC (14.73 µM) followed by 5 mM glutamate
  treatment for 1 h. Then, cell viability (A) was determined with MTT assay and intracellular
  ROS levels (B) were measured by DCFH-DA assays 24 h after exposure to glutamate.
  The value of cell viability was set to 100% for the non-treated control cells, and
  the intracellular degree of ROS production was set to 100% for the glutamate-treated
  cells. Values are expressed as the mean ± SE calculated from three replicates. The
  statistical symbols (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; n.s., no significance)
  indicate significant differences from the glutamate-treated group.
