caption: EPBS mitigates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in EGFR−overexpressing
  or EGFR−knockdown NSCLC cells. (A) Human NSCLC A549 and PC-9 cells and human normal
  lung HEL299 cells were seeded on six-well plates (5 × 105 cells/well), and then
  cells were harvested and lysed. Western blot analysis was carried out. (B,C) A549
  cells were seeded on 24-well plates (8 × 104 cells/well). A549 cells were transfected
  with 300 ng of human EGFR/HER1 gene ORF cDNA clone expression plasmid (pCMV3-EGFR)
  or pCMV3-untagged negative control vector (pCMV3) with transfection reagent in serum-free
  medium (SFM) for 24 h. After 24 h, the transfected A549 cells were changed with
  a complete medium and then treated with 100 μM of EPBS for 4 h. Western Blot analysis
  was performed. (D,E) PC-9 cells were seeded on 24-well plates (8 × 104 cells/well)
  overnight and were transfected with 100 nM of EGFR siRNA or scrambled siRNA transfection
  reagent in a serum-free medium for 36 h. The transfected PC-9 cells were treated
  with 100 µM of EPBS in a completed medium. After 4 h, the cells were harvested and
  lysed, and then Western Blot analysis was performed. The fold numbers at the bottom
  of the blots indicate fold activation for the nontreated control group. All experiments
  were performed at least three times, and representative data are shown.
