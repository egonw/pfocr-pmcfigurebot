caption: Evolutionary conservation of core components and regulators of the TOR signaling
  pathway in microalgae. The opisthokonts Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae
  and the streptophytes Arabidopsis thaliana and Mesostigma viride were included as
  reference. Protein sequences were obtained from the NCBI (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), JGI
  (phycocosm.jgi.doe.gov), or directly from the specific genome database using the
  Orthofinder software. The cladogram was constructed based on 18S rRNA sequences
  of the indicated species. Sequences were identified using the SILVA rRNA database
  and aligned using the MUSCLE algorithm in MEGA-X. Filled circles represent conservation
  while open circles indicate partial conservation of some of the proteins that make
  up the Ragulator or GATOR1/2 complexes.
