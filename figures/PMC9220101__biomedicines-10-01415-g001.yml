caption: 'Three conventional pathways in PAH pathogenesis. In the endothelin pathway,
  vascular endothelial cells release endothelin-1, which induces vascular smooth muscle
  proliferation and vasoconstriction. In the NO/cGMP and prostacyclin pathway, the
  functional anti-proliferative and vasodilative ability of NO and prostacyclin signaling
  are hindered by PDE5 and prostacyclin synthase deficiency, respectively, which result
  in vascular smooth muscle proliferation and vasoconstriction, and further PAH pathogenesis.
  Red arrow: downregulated; Black arrow: upregulated.'
