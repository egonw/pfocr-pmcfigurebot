figure_title: PBK activates the NFκB pathway through interacting with TRIM37
caption: a SKOV3 and UWB1.289 cells transfected with PLKO.1, PBK shRNA 1 (sh PBK-1),
  and PBK shRNA 2 (sh PBK-2) were challenged with olaparib for 24 h, the protein levels
  of p-IκBα, IκBα, XIAP, Bcl-XL, PBK, and β-actin were detected using western blot.
  B Cells transfected with PLKO.1, PBK shRNA 2 (sh PBK-2), and/or PCMV-PBK were challenged
  with olaparib for 24 h, the protein levels were detected using western blot. c,
  d Quantification of the protein levels in a and b, respectively. e Cells transfected
  with PLKO.1, PBK shRNA 2 (sh PBK-2), and/or TRIM37 shRNA 1 (sh TRIM37-1) were challenged
  with olaparib for 24 h, the protein levels were detected using western blot. F After
  the cells were treated in the same way as e, immunofluorescence staining was performed
  to detect p65 nuclear translocation. g Quantification of the protein levels in e.
  h Quantification of the ratio of p65 nuclear translocation in f. (Data are presented
  as the mean ± SEM, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, n = 3).
