caption: Effects of allethrin on the expression of apoptosis and autophagy markers
  at the protein and mRNA levels in the rat ovaries (A–E). The protein expression
  levels of active caspase-3, PI3K, AKT and mTOR were examined by western blotting.
  The mRNA expression levels of the genes encoding PI3K, AKT and mTOR were detected
  by RT–PCR (F–H). All data are expressed as the means ± SDs. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.005;
  *** p < 0.0001; **** p < 0.00001.
