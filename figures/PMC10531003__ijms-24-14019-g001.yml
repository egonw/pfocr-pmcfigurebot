caption: 'Pathogenic mechanisms involved in AKI transition to CKD. The mentioned risk
  factors prone AKI subjects to higher glomerular and/or tubule-interstitial system
  cellular damage. Furthermore, apoptotic, necrotic and senescent cells (cells blocked
  in the G2/M cell cycle) release and stimulate pro-fibrotic factors, which, via FMT,
  PMT, EMT, EndMT and MMT, will generate myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts secrete ECM
  that will generate glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial fibrosis and arteriosclerosis,
  defined as CKD. Acronyms: AKI—acute kidney injury; CKD—chronic kidney disease; CTGF—connective
  tissue growth factor; ECM—extracellular matrix; EGF—epidermal growth factor; EMT—epithelial
  to mesenchymal transition; EndMT—endothelial to mesenchymal transition; FMT—fibroblast
  to myofibroblast transition; HIF—hypoxia-inducible factor; KDIGO—Kidney Disease
  Improving Global Outcomes; IL—interleukin; MMP-7—matrix metalloproteinase-7; MMT—macrophage
  myofibroblast transition; mTOR—mammalian target of rapamycin; Notch—neurogenic locus
  notch homolog protein; PDGF—platelet-derived growth factor; PGF—placental growth
  factor; PMT—pericyte to myofibroblast-transition; RAS—renin-angiotensin system;
  RNAs—ribonucleic acids; TGF-β1—transforming growth factor; TIMP—tissue inhibitor
  of metalloproteinase; TNF-α—tumor necrosis factor alpha; TWEAK—TNF-like weak inducer
  of apoptosis; VEGF—vascular endothelial growth factor; Wnt/β-catenin—wingless/beta-catenin.'
