caption: 'Effect of IGFBP7 on the expression of TGFβ1 and α-SMA in the EC109 cell
  line. The protein expression of IGFBP7 (A), TGFβ1 (B) and α-SMA (C) was examined
  by western blotting. β-actin served as an internal control (n=4). *P<0.05 vs. the
  control group; #P<0.05 vs. the 48-h group. IGFBP7, insulin-like growth factor-binding
  protein-7; TGFβ1, transforming growth factor-β1; α-SMA, α-smooth muscle actin.'
article_title: IGFBP7 remodels the tumor microenvironment of esophageal squamous cell
  carcinoma by activating the TGFβ1/SMAD signaling pathway.
