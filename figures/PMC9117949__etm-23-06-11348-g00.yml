caption: 'Effects of LEN on the viability of H2O2-stimulated PC12 cells. (A) The viability
  of PC12 cells after treatment with H2O2, detected by Cell Counting Kit-8. (B) The
  viability of PC12 cells after treatment with LEN, detected by MTT. (C) The viability
  of H2O2-stimulated PC12 cells after treatment with LEN at different doses, detected
  by MTT. (D) The LDH level in H2O2-stimulated PC12 cells after treatment with LEN
  in different doses, detected by LDH assay. **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs. control;
  #P<0.05, ##P<0.01 and ###P<0.001 vs. H2O2. LEN, lenalidomide; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase.'
