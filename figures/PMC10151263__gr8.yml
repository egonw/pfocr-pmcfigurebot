caption: Possible complete path of the ST36 acupoints moxibustion effect on the liver
  from the metabolic perspective. → indicates positive regulation relationship; ⇢
  indicates the potential regulatory relationship; ↑ indicates the increase of expression;
  ↓ indicates that the expression decreases.
article_title: Grain-sized moxibustion at Zusanli (ST36) promotes hepatic autophagy
  in rats with hyperlipidemia by regulating the ULK1 and TFEB expression through the
  AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway.
