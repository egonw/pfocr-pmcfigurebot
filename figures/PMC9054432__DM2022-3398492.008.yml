caption: 'Knock-down of RUVBL1 by siRNA attenuated growth and metastasis of the OSCC
  cell line, Cal-27, by inhibiting β-catenin signaling. (a) Knock-down of RUVBL1 by
  siRNA inhibited migration of the Cal-27 cells in the wound healing assay. Significant
  differences between groups were assessed using a Student''s T test and shown by
  ∗ and #, p <0.05. (b). After transfection of the Cal-27 cells with RUVBL1 siRNA
  or scramble siRNA (siNC), cell-invasive ability was determined by cell invasion
  assay. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Significant differences between
  groups were assessed using a Student''s T test and shown by ∗ and #, p < 0.05. (c)
  Expression of β-catenin pathway proteins was detected by western blot analysis.
  Intensity of the gray band was calculated by ImageJ and shown in the figure.'
