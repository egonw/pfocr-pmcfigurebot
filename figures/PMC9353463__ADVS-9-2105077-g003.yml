caption: PPP1R13L was involved in the TMEM44‐AS1/miR‐2355‐5p‐dependent impacts on
  GC cell resistance to 5‐FU. A) Venn plot showing the four data sets. B) OS and DFS
  of GC patients (n = 112) with different PPP1R13L expression levels in their tumors.
  C) Linear regression analysis was done to each individual PPP1R13L and miR‐2355‐5p
  expression, r = −0.3222, p < 0.0001. D) RIP experiments were performed using the
  Ago2 antibody, and specific primers were used to detect the enrichment of PPP1R13L.
  E) Dual‐luciferase gene reporter assays were used to assess the binding sites of
  PPP1R13L and miR‐2355‐5p. The relative luciferase activities were restrained in
  the HEK‐293 T cells co‐transfected with PPP1R13L‐wt and miR‐2355‐5p. F) Transfection
  efficiency of si‐PPP1R13L and oe‐PPP1R13L was assessed by RT‐qPCR and WB assays.
  G) The proliferative abilities of HGC 27/R and MKN‐45/R cells subject to si‐NC,
  si‐PPP1R13L, oe‐NC, or oe‐PPP1R13L transfection were detected through EdU assay.
  Scale bar, 20 µm. H) The cell apoptosis rate was determined for the two GC cell
  lines with 5‐FU resistance through flow cytometry. I) ABCC1, ABCG2, Caspase3, cleaved
  caspase‐3, Survivin, and GAPDH protein expression was measured in HGC‐27/R and MKN‐45/R
  cells by western blotting. J) P53, AIFM2, Bcl‐2, Bax, and GAPDH protein levels within
  HGC‐27/R and MKN‐45/R cells. 5 µg mL−1 5‐FU was used to treat cells for a 48‐h period
  before EdU assays, flow cytometric analysis, and protein extraction. Data are mean
  ± SD, n = 3. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
