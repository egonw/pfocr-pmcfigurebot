caption: 'involvement of PPARγ in the baicalein-induced enhancement of LXRα, ABCA1,
  and ABCG1 expression. (A–B) THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells were treated with
  or without 100 μM baicalein for 24 h. (A) PPARγ expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR
  and western blot. (B) Western blot analysis of PPARγ levels in the cytoplasm and
  nucleus. (C–E) THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells were transfected with scrambled
  siRNA or PPARγ siRNA for 48 h, followed by treatment with or without 100 μM baicalein
  for 24 h. (C) Detection of PPARγ protein expression using western blot. (D) The
  expression of LXRα, ABCA1, and ABCG1 was determined by qRT-PCR and western blot.
  (E) The liquid scintillation counting method was used to measure the efflux of cholesterol
  onto apoA-I and HDL. The results are shown as the mean ± SD from three independent
  experiments. **P < 0.01 vs. control group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 vs. baicalein group.'
