caption: miR-218-5p is upregulated in both cellular and exosomal fractions. A Compared
  to the blank group, six microRNAs were up- or downregulated in both the cells and
  exosomes of the Pm-42 group. B qPCR detection of miR-218-5p in the cells after coincubation
  with Pm-42, DH5α, or PBS. Data are expressed as mean ± SD from 3 independent experiments
article_title: Parvimonas micra activates the Ras/ERK/c-Fos pathway by upregulating
  miR-218-5p to promote colorectal cancer progression.
