caption: 'CSCs and EMT signaling pathways: After the activation of the WNT pathway,
  β-catenin is transported to the nucleus. During SHH signal transduction, the PTCH1
  transmembrane protein receptor activates SMO and GLI 1/2 transcription factor detachment
  from SUFU to increase snail expression. IL-6 can activate STAT3 to modulate EMT
  and CSCs. P50-p65 is an important factor for NF-κB signal to exert biological function.
  Activation of the SMAD complex leads to enhancement of tumor progression. PI3K and
  PTEN antagonize each other and further regulate mTORC1/2 by phosphorylating AKT
  (,). CSCs, cancer stem cells; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition; SHH, Sonic
  Hedgehog; PTCH1, Patched 1; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog.'
