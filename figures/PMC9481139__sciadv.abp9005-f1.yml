figure_title: CRISPR knockout screen reveals potential synergistic partners with gilteritinib
caption: '(A) Schematic overview of genome-wide CRISPR screen design. (B) Volcano
  plot segregating candidate hits into positively (red) and negatively selected (blue)
  genes (four biological replicates per condition). (C) Pathway enrichment analysis
  of the top hits in negative selection by IPA. The locations of genes of interest
  in pathways are highlighted. Pink: Hits prioritized for validation here. Green:
  Hits that have high ranks in both gilteritinib and midostaurin screens but were
  not validated here. Orange: Hits shared by CRISPR screen and two RNA-seq datasets.
  (D) Contribution of each sgRNA to the top hits. (E) Selected overlapping hits shared
  by gilteritinib and midostaurin screens. DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide.'
