caption: Loss of BAG1L alters AR dynamics in the nucleusHistograms of the number of
  mEos2-AR fusion protein trajectories versus the diffusion coefficient, D (on a logarithmic
  scale). The data were obtained by SMT analysis of widefield fluorescence images
  of nuclei of (A) control and (B) BAG1L KO cells.(C) Schematic depiction of SMT.
  Individual AR molecules in the cell nucleus (green, red, blue triangles) are localized
  by the emission from an attached fluorophore (here, mEos2) in successive image frames.
  The positions of each AR molecule are connected to visualize its diffusion (right,
  black arrows). These traces are analyzed to determine the average diffusion coefficient,
  (D) and standard deviations.(D) Cells lines used in this work.(E–G) Data obtained
  by SMT analysis of widefield fluorescence images of nuclei of BAG1L KO rescue, BAG1L
  KO control, and BAG1L KO cells transduced with mutated BAG1L.
