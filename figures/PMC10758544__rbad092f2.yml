caption: TiPs Facilitated the polarization of macrophages toward the M1 phenotype
  in vitro. (A) Heat map showing differentially expressed genes in RAW264.7 in response
  to TiPs. (B) Bubble chart. (C) The differences in genes enriched for the inflammatory
  response and tumor necrosis factor-activated receptor activity pathway. (D) Western
  blot and quantitative analysis showing levels of inflammation-related protein after
  intervention with TiPs. (E) qRT-PCR results showing expression levels of IL-6, IL-1β
  and TNF-α mRNA. (F) Western blot and quantitative analysis showing levels of iNOS
  and ARG1 after intervention with TiPs. (G) Immunofluorescence staining of iNOS and
  ARG1 in RAW264.7 after intervention with TiPs. Scale bar = 50 µm. The data were
  represented as mean ± SD of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01.
  qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time PCR.
