caption: The combination of pirfenidone and SB525334 could be relieving CE-related
  liver fibrosis. Using inhibitors of the TGF-β signalling pathway, immunoblot experiments
  highlight the expression of fibrosis-related proteins in the liver tissues of CE
  mice treated with different groups of drugs. Data are representative of one of three
  independent experiments (n = 3–4 mice per group). One-way ANOVA was used for analysis,
  bars represent the mean ± s.e.m. (ns, not significant; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).
