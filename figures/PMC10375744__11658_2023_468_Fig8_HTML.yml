caption: 'Up-regulation of miR-632 expression activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
  to promote skin wound regeneration in rats. A Schematic of full-thickness skin wound
  in SD rats and subcutaneous injection of miR-632 agomir on postoperative days 0
  and 4, with subsequent study manipulations. B, C Representative images of wound
  repair in SD rats treated with miR-632 agomir for 9 days and quantification of wound
  repair rate. D Representative H&E staining of wound tissue after 9 days of miR-632
  agomir treatment in SD rats; Yellow dotted lines represent areas of neoepithelium;
  Es: eschar; NE: neoepithelium; GT: regenerated granulation tissue; Yellow arrows
  represent quantified areas of regenerated granulation tissue; scale bar 200 μm.
  E, F Quantification of epidermal regeneration thickness and regenerated granulation
  tissue in wound area. G Western blot analysis of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
  activation in wound region of SD rats after 9 days of miR-632 agomir treatment.
  H–L Quantification of GSK3β, β-catenin, Vimentin, Cyclin D1, and c-MYC expression
  after up-regulation of miR-632. All data are expressed as mean ± SEM from three
  independent experiments, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001'
