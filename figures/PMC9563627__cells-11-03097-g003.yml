caption: A model that depicts the interplay between estrogen, HRR factors, DNA damage
  and DDR and suggests how this interplay triggers estrogen-dependent cancer formation
  in cells harboring mutation in HRR genes. ER-positive cells contain a basal level
  of mRNA encoding HRR factors. Upon supplementation of estrogen or due to DSB formation,
  the level of these mRNAs is elevated. Addition of estrogen results in cell proliferation,
  which is tightly regulated, both positively and negatively, by DDR factors, to ensure
  controlled cell proliferation and genomic stability. Incensement in HRR factors
  due to DSB induction in ER-positive cells deprived of estrogen will upsurge the
  activity of the HRR pathway to ensure genomic stability. In cells harboring a mutation
  in one of the HRR genes, there is only a partial augmentation of HRR genes, resulting
  in insufficient activity of the HRR pathway. These will lead to impaired cell cycle
  regulation and genomic instability that may trigger cancer development.
