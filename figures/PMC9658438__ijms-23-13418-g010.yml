caption: A possible model of VvWRKY28 in response to salt stress. VvWRKY28 was overexpressed
  after cold stress, binded to the W-box on the promoter of downstream target genes,
  and up-regulated the expression of RAB18, COR15A, ERD10, PIF4, COR47, and ICS1.
  Secondly, salt stress induces high-level expression of VvWRKY28, activates ABA signaling
  pathway and salt stress response process, and promotes the expression of NCED3 and
  SnRK2.4 in the ABA-dependent pathway. The expression levels of CAT2, SOD1, and SOS2
  and ABA-independent P5CS1 genes increased significantly.
