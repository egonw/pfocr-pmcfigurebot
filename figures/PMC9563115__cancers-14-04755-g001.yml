caption: 'Mechanisms of TANs that promote tumor progression: (1) TANs secrete cytokines,
  such as IL-17, IL-23 and TNF-α, to induce MSCs to convert into CAFs, and to promote
  tumor-cell proliferation; (2) TANs secrete NE to bind intracellular IRS-1, releasing
  its inhibitory effect on the PI3K/Akt pathway, and promoting tumor proliferation;
  (3) cell-derived exosomes induce the autophagy and N2 polarization of neutrophils
  via HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB signaling to promote cancer-cell proliferation and migration;
  (4) TANs secrete NE and MMP-9 to degrade the ECM and accelerate the tumor invasion;
  (5) TAN-derived VEGF, HGF and MMP9 promote the angiogenesis of tumor cells; (6)
  tumor-derived IL-8 induces neutrophils to secret arginase-1, resulting in arginase
  depletion and the establishment of an immunosuppressive TME; (7) GM-CSF activates
  TANs to express high levels of the immunosuppressive molecule PD-L1 through the
  JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway; (8) neutrophils can be recruited by tumor cells through
  chemokines, such as the CXCL/CXCR1/2 signal axis.'
