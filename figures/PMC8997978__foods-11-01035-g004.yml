caption: '(A) Enriched plasminogen, prothrombin and angiotensin 1–10 involved in the
  metabolic pathway of neuroactive ligand–receptor. The up-regulated proteins in the
  pathways were summarized. The highly expressed AGT and PARL in SFEY are involved
  in the metabolic pathway of neuroactive. Square frames represent proteins in the
  metabolic pathway. Round frames represent small molecular metabolites. The boxes
  in red indicate the up-regulated proteins. HTR, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2;
  TAR, trace amine-associated receptor; AGT, angiotensinogen Ⅱ, Ⅲ; AGTR, angiotensin
  II receptor type 1; NPFF, neuropeptide FF-amide peptide; NPFFR, neuropeptide FF
  receptor 1; NPY, neuropeptide Y; NPYR, neuropeptide Y receptor; AVP, arginine vasopressin;
  AVPR, arginine vasopressin receptor 2; PAL, proteinase-activated like; PAR, proteinase-activated
  receptor; PRLH, prolactin-releasing-like hormone; PRLHR, prolactin-releasing hormone
  receptor. (B) Interaction networks of differentially abundant proteins. Circle nodes:
  differentially abundant proteins (red: up-regulation; circle size: degree of connectivity
  of the protein, namely, the number of proteins that directly interact with a protein);
  lines: protein–protein interactions.'
