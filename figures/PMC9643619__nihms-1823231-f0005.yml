figure_title: scRNA-seq analysis of the monocyte/macrophage populations isolated from
  patients with sHLH
caption: (A) Scheme of experimental design. (B) The t-distributed stochastic neighbor
  embedding (t-SNE) plot demonstrates the main cell types identified in the samples
  of sHLH patients and healthy donors collectively. (C) The summary shows the cell
  proportions of the disease group within the indicated monocyte/macrophage clusters.
  (D) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the upregulated genes in cluster 12 compared
  to other monocyte/macrophage clusters (excluding cluster 11) identified in the samples
  analyzed collectively. (E) Expression levels of GZMA and GZMB in different monocyte/macrophage
  clusters identified in the samples analyzed collectively. (F) Monocle prediction
  of the developmental trajectory of monocyte/macrophage clusters with pseudotime
  (up) and cluster (11 and 12) information (down) mapped on. (G) Heat map shows expression
  levels of marker genes of cMoP and activated macrophage ordered by pseudotime. cMoP,
  common monocyte progenitor; MÏ†, macrophage.
