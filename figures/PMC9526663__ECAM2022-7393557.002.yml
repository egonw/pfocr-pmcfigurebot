caption: 'Effect of Ukgansan on MPP+-induced Nurr1 and Nurr1-mediated expression.
  In differentiated PC12 cells, the effect of Ukgansan on MPP+-induced changed Nurr1-mediated
  expression (Nurr1, TH, VMAT2, and DAT) levels. Values are presented as means ± S.E.M.
  ∗∗∗p < 0.001 compared with the control group, ###p < 0.001 compared with the MPP+-only
  treatment group.'
