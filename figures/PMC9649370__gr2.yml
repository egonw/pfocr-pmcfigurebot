caption: Urine proteomic profiles and differentially expressed proteins for GC and
  precancerous gastric lesions. a. PLS-DA plot for the overview of urine proteomic
  profile. b. Protein clusters with similar trajectories from mild (SG/CAG) to advanced
  (IM/LGIN) gastric lesions and then to GC. For 139 proteins with VIP score >1 in
  the comparison between GC and gastric lesions in both discovery and validation sets,
  the changing trajectories of proteins were analyzed through locally estimated scatterplot
  smoothing (LOESS) regression. Proteins with similar trajectories were divided into
  groups through hierarchical clustering. c. Top 15 enriched pathway of proteins.
  KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was conducted for with VIP score >1 in the comparison
  between GC and gastric lesions in both discovery and validation sets. Rich factor
  is the ratio of the differentially expressed gene number (e.g., the gene that we
  submitted for the KEGG pathway analysis) to the total gene number in a certain KEGG-defined
  pathway. d. A total of 43 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) significantly
  associated with GC compared with SG/CAG (left) or IM/LGIN (right) as the reference
  respectively. P values and ORs were calculated based on the combined datasets. Proteins
  positively associated with GC (OR > 1) are shown in red and proteins inversely associated
  with GC (OR < 1) are shown in blue. e. Pearson correlation of 43 DEPs between GC
  and gastric lesions. For proteins with VIP >1 in the discovery and validation sets,
  those satisfying logistic regression P < 0.05 in both sets between comparison groups
  (GC vs. SG/CAG or GC vs. IM/LGIN) were defined as DEPs. f. PPI network of DEPs between
  GC and gastric lesions. Among 43 DEPs, the top 15 core hub proteins were defined
  based on the Maximal Clique Centrality algorithm using Cytoscape. CAG, chronic atrophic
  gastritis; GC, gastric cancer; IM, intestinal metaplasia; LGIN, low-grade intraepithelial
  neoplasia; SG, superficial gastritis.
