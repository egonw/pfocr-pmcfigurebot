caption: 'The expression of genes in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathways in the P.
  koraiensis under light stress. CHS chalcone synthase, CHI chalcone isomerase, F3H
  flavanone 3-hydroxylase, F3′5′H flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase, LAR leucocyanidin reductase,
  F3′H flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase, FLS flavonol synthase, DFR dihydroflavonol 4-reductase,
  ANS anthocyanidin synthase. Reconstruction of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway
  with the differentially expressed structural genes and the differentially accumulated
  metabolites (DAMs) in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. The cluster marker on
  the right side of the heatmap represents the names of each metabolite. CK: control.
  LS: light shade. HS: heavy shade. The color scale from Min (blue) to Max (red) refers
  to the metabolite contents from low to high.'
