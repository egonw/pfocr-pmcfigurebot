caption: FABP7 overexpression inhibits A431 and colo-16 cell viability, invasion and
  migration abilities. (A) Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was used to validate
  the transfection of oe-FABP7. (B) Western blotting confirmed the successful transfection
  of oe-FABP7. (C) Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was used to detect the viability following
  transfection. (D) The numbers of colonies formed by oe-FABP7-transfected cells were
  significantly lower compared with those than control groups. (E) Cell scratch assay
  was used to determine the migration of cells following transfection. (F) Transwell
  invasion assay was used to detect the cell invasion capacity (Scale bar, 200 Âµm).
  *P<0.05 and **P<0.01 vs. NC. FABP7, fatty acid-binding protein 7; oe, overexpression
