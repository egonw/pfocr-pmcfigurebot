caption: (a) Method for inferring the mechanism of action of differential regulation
  of genes APX, GST, POD, CAT, SOD, and/or GPX to determine involvement in the oxidative
  stress relief pathway. Differential regulation of HKT, NHX, and/or the SOS pathway
  to infer ion transport regulation. ABA signaling, differential hormone sensitivity,
  and/or differential accumulation due to the presence of WRKY are classified as hormone
  signaling. The osmotic response was according to differential expression of P5Cs,
  STZ, and ABA signaling. This is modeled after Arabidopsis since most WRKYs were
  investigated therein; (b) How WRKYs qualified for ABA signaling modeled in Arabidopsis.
  Split into independent signaling based on differential expression of DREB and dependent
  signaling based on differential regulation of ABA biosynthesis genes (PP2CA and
  MYC). Biosynthesis genes included RD22, ABI, AAO, NCED, and ZEP.
