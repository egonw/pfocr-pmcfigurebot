caption: MCDD alleviates the phenomenon of PCOS-IR fatty liver and adipocyte enlargement.
  After the rats were sacrificed, the livers and small pieces of adipose tissue around
  ovary were collected, soaked in 4% paraformaldehyde, and stained separately with
  Masson trichrome and oil red O staining or hematoxylin-eosin. (A–F) The Masson trichrome-stained
  sections of the rat liver tissue in each group are shown in the large picture (scan
  bar:200 μm), and the oil red O-stained sections are shown in the small picture in
  the lower right corner (scan bar:50 μm). (Arrows in Masson trichrome staining show
  vacuolar fat vesicles, lipid deposits in hepatocytes in Oil Red O-stained sections
  are stained red). (G–L) HE sections of adipose tissue of rats in each group (scan
  bar:200 μm). (In the model group, arrows indicate fat cells with increased volume
  and irregular shapes). The above results, n=3.
