caption: NBD combined with FMT increased SCFAs in the colonic feces of rats with colitis
  to strengthen the intestinal microbial balance. (A-F) The amounts of SCFAs, including
  acetate (A), propionate (B), butyrate (C), valerate (D), isobutyrate (E) and isovalerate
  (F), as detected by LC-MS, n = 6. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001. (G) Heatmap showing Spearman correlations between several fecal SCFAs
  with significant differences and bacterial genera with a coefficient less than 0.05
article_title: New Baitouweng decoction combined with fecal microbiota transplantation
  alleviates DSS-induced colitis in rats by regulating gut microbiota metabolic homeostasis
  and the STAT3/NF-κB signaling pathway.
