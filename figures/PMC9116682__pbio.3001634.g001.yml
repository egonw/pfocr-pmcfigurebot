  genes
caption: (A) Schematic diagram illustrating the assay setup where culturing B16 cells
  at low density of 100 cells/cm2 (Top) results in the transition of melanocyte from
  depigmented (day 0) to pigmented state (day 6) as shown in the pellet images (N
  = 3) (Bottom). Quantitative analysis of melanin intensity of the pellets is shown
  in the line graph (Between). Mean ± SEM is plotted for 3 biological replicates.
  One-way ANOVA is applied, F(3,8) = 18.28. p-Value = 0.0006. Turkey’s test is performed
  for pairwise comparison. (B) Representative western blot of key pigmentation proteins,
  MITF, PMEL, TYR, and DCT on days 3 to 6 (D3 to D6) (N = 3). Arrows mark the sizes
  of molecular weight markers written in kDa. Numerical values show average fold change
  for 3 biological replicates. (C) Heatmap depicting relative mean expression levels
  of pigmentation proteins wrt D3 for 3 independent experiments. Scale from red to
  green represents the z-scores of fold change (below). (D) Heatmap represents 1,493
  DEGs with an adjusted p-value < 0.001 obtained from time-course analysis performed
  using the LRT test for 2 independent biological replicates. Scale from blue to red
  represents z-score from ‒1 to +1. Hierarchical clustering was performed on the expression
  data of 1,493 DEGs into 7 clusters. (E) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was done
  for DEGs with adjusted p-value < 0.001 up-regulated on days 3, 4, 5, and 6. Bubble
  plot depicts the enrichment of pathways on different days, where the size of bubble
  represents the gene ratio and colour represents the p-value. (F) Representative
  confocal microscopy images show lipid droplet accumulation in B16 cells during pigmentation.
  Images were taken at 63×. Scale is 5 μm. (G) Violin plot depicting the quantitation
  of total volume of lipid droplets per cell using VOLOCITY software. Approximately
  25 to 30 cells are taken in each replicate. Mean ± SEM is plotted in 3 independent
  biological replicates. One-way ANOVA is applied, F(2,52) = 11.45. p-Value < 0.0001.
  Turkey’s test is performed for pairwise comparison. ***p-Value = 0.0001, **p-value
  = 0.034. ns is not significant. (H) Dot plot depicting the quantitation of size
  of individual lipid droplets (as volume spread of lipid droplets) using VOLOCITY
  software. Approximately 25 to 30 cells are taken in each replicate. Mean ± SEM is
  plotted in 3 independent biological replicates. One-way ANOVA is applied, F(2,262)
  = 3.54. p-Value = 0.0303. Turkey’s test is performed for pairwise comparison. Quantitative
  data are provided in  for Panels A, C, G, and H. Quantitative data for Panels D
  and E are provided in . DEG, differentially expressed gene; LRT, likelihood-ratio
  test.
