caption: KEGG pathway enrichment of DEGs in the B vs. A group. A KEGG pathway enrichment
  of the upregulated DEGs. B KEGG pathway enrichment of the downregulated DEGs. The
  size of the circle represents the number of DEGs in the pathway, and the color of
  the circle represents the padj value (p value adjusted to false discovery rate),
  reflecting the enrichment degree. C The DEGs involved in the denitrification pathway.
  The genes encoding enzymes in the rectangular box with a red border were significantly
  upregulated, and the FPKM of each gene is shown in the rectangle inside the ellipse
