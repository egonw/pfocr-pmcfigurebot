caption: 'TPS inhibited melanogenesis through suppressing the α-MSH-MC1R signalling
  pathway in HaCaT cells and HEM cells. A, B – HEM was pretreated or not with UVA
  exposure (15 J/cm2) before TPS (10 μg/ml) and N-1A (20 μm) were applied. Melanin
  contents and the expression of tyrosinase were measured as described in methods.
  C – HaCaT cells were treated with TPS (10 μg/ml) and/or N-1A (20 μm) in the presence
  or absence of UVA exposure (15 J/cm2). ELISA was then applied to detect the expression
  of α-MSH. D – HEM cells were treated with TPS (10 μg/ml) and N-1A (20 μm) in the
  presence or absence of UVA exposure (15 J/cm2). ELISA was then applied to detect
  the expression of α-MSH. *P < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 versus non-treated
  cells, #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001 versus UVA-treated cells, ap < 0.05,
  aap < 0.01, aaap < 0.001, nsp > 0.05'
