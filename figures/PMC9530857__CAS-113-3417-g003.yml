caption: 'JNK pathway was crucial for expansion and stemness of human colorectal cancer
  cells in the context of BRG1 suppression. (A) Quantitative real‐time (qRT)‐PCR analysis
  of c‐JUN expression in DLD‐1 and HCT 116 cells silenced with control (si nontargeting
  RNA) or siJUN (DLD‐1, p = 0.0046; HCT 116, p < 0.0001; n = 3, 4). Means ± SEM are
  shown. (B) MTS assay of DLD‐1 and HCT 116 cells treated with control or siJUN (n = 4,
  3). Means ± SEM are shown (HCT116 control: day 1, 0.288 ± 0.002, day 2, 0.477 ± 0.009,
  day 3, 1.027 ± 0.003, day 5, 1.403 ± 0.001; siJUN: day 1, 0.244 ± 0.005, day 2,
  0.430 ± 0.005, day 3, 1.037 ± 0.004, day 5, 1.429 ± 0.011). (C) qRT‐PCR analysis
  of HCT 116 cells silenced with control and siJUN on day 2 after siRNA treatment
  (n = 5). Means ± SEM are shown. (D) Crystal violet staining of DLD‐1 and HCT 116
  cells silenced with control alone, siBRG1 alone, and siBRG1 + siJUN on day 3 after
  siRNA treatment. (E) Ratio of MTS assay on day 3 / day 0 of DLD‐1 and HCT 116 cells
  silenced with control alone, siBRG1 alone, and siBRG1 + siJUN (DLD‐1, p = 0.0104;
  HCT 116, p = 0.0117; n = 3–4). (F) qRT‐PCR analysis of DLD‐1 and HCT 116 cells silenced
  with control alone, siBRG1 alone, and siBRG1 + siJUN on day 2 after siRNA treatment
  (n = 3). Analyzed by Student'' s t‐test. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001'
