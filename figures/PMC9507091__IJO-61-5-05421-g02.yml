caption: Effect of EA on the cell cycle progression of human hepatocellular carcinoma
  cells. (A) Cell cycle progression of MHCC97-L and HCCLM3 cells was analyzed by flow
  cytometry following EA treatment. (B) Percentage of MHCC97-L and HCCLM3 cells in
  each phase of the cell cycle. n=5. (C and D) Western blot analysis of the expression
  levels of cell cycle-related proteins at 48 h in MHCC97-L and HCCLM3 cells. β-actin
  was used as a control. All data are shown as the mean ± SD. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.
  EA, eupalinolide A.
