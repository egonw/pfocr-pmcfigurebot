figure_title: PKM2 deficiency results in decreased lipid synthesis in breast cancer
  cells
caption: 'Heatmap showing differential gene expression profiling in PKM2 KO versus
  wild‐type MCF7 cells (n = 3).Gene set enrichment analysis of the top enriched signatures
  affected by PKM2 KO in MCF7. Hallmark 50 gene sets and KEGG 186 gene sets were used
  for this analysis.The cholesterol homeostasis signature was decreased by knocking
  out PKM2 in MCF7 cells. Adjusted P‐value and normalized enrichment score (NES) were
  generated by GSEA.Decreased expression of lipid synthetic genes in PKM2 KO MCF7
  cells analyzed by qRT‐PCR (n = 3).Decreased expression of lipid synthetic genes
  in PKM2 KO MDA‐MB‐231 cells analyzed by qRT‐PCR (n = 3).Ingenuity pathway analysis
  (IPA) of proteins affected by PKM2 KO in MDA‐MB‐231 cells in Fig . Cholesterol synthesis
  pathways were highlighted in red. Data information: Data are displayed (D and E)
  as means ± SD. Statistical significance was assessed using two‐tailed Student’s
  t‐test, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001.Source data are available online
  for this figure.'
