caption: NEFA activated the three UPR signaling pathways in bovine mammary epithelial
  cells. (A–E) Relative mRNA expression of PERK, eIF2α, IRE1α, XBP1, and ATF6 in BMECs
  after treatment with various concentrations (0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 mM) of NEFA for 3,
  6, 9, and 12 h. (F) Protein expression of PERK, P-PERK, IRE1α, P-IRE1α, XBP1, and
  ATF6 in BMECs stimulated with the different concentrations of NEFA for 6 h. Data
  are presented as the means ± the standard errors of the mean (SEM) of three independent
  experiments. n.s. means not significant, * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01.
