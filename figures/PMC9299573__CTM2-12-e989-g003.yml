caption: PTEN is down‐regulated and is negatively correlated with miR‐20a expression
  in non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues. (A) qPCR results showed that miR‐20a
  was remarkably increased in NSCLC tissues compared with tumour‐adjacent normal tissues
  (n = 90). (B and C) Western blot results showed that PTEN was significantly decreased
  in cancer tissues (n = 24). (D) The expression levels of PTEN were negatively correlated
  with miR‐20a expression levels (n = 24). Outcomes are means ± standard deviation
  (SD) (**p < .01; ****p < .0001)
article_title: Cancer‐associated fibroblast‐derived exosomal microRNA‐20a suppresses
  the PTEN/PI3K‐AKT pathway to promote the progression and chemoresistance of non‐small
  cell lung cancer.
