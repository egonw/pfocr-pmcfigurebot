caption: Transcriptomics revealed that baicalin regulates intestinal immunity and
  repairs intestinal damage. Fold change of differentially expressed genes related
  to (A) NF-κB signaling pathway and ras signaling pathway; (B) intestinal immunity
  cell adhesion molecules and complement and coagulation cascades; (C) chemokine signaling
  pathway and O-glycan biosynthesis; (D) cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction as
  well as T-cell receptor signaling pathway; and (E) the process of Th1/Th2 and Th17
  cell differentiation. The red arrows indicate upregulation.
