caption: 'Mut-KIF4 strongly binds to PARP1, whose activity influences cell survival
  rate. (A and B) Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) immunoblotting results of the primary
  culture neuron lysates (A), and quantification of amounts of 110 kD PARP1 bands
  (B). The statistical values were normalized to relevant bands in the input lanes.
  The input samples and immunoprecipitated complexes including KIF4 were analyzed
  by immunoblotting using an antibody specific to PARP1; IP, immunoprecipitation;
  IB, immunoblotting; IgG, immunoglobulin G; Cyt., Cytosol; Nuc., Nuclear. Data are
  presented as mean ± SEM (n = 3 independent experiments). ***P < 0.001 (Student’s
  t tests). (C and D) Immunoblotting results of BioID pulldown (C), and quantification
  of amounts of PARP1 protein bands (D). The statistical values were normalized to
  overexpressed KIF4 bands. The biotinylated PARP1 was clearly detected in a lysate
  of N2A cells expressing Mut-KIF4. Data are presented as mean ± SEM (n = 3 independent
  experiments). ***P < 0.001 (Student’s t tests). (E and F) The survival assay using
  CMFDA with or without indicated reagents. Representative images of hippocampal culture
  neurons (E), and quantification of survival rates for each condition (F). Scale
  bar, 50 µm. Data are presented as mean ± SEM (n = 3 independent experiments). ns,
  P > 0.05, ****P < 0.0001 (two-way ANOVA). (G and H) Hippocampal neurons immunostained
  with anti-PAR and anti-MAP2 antibodies (G), and quantification of the normalized
  fluorescent intensity for each condition (H). Scale bar, 10 µm. Data are presented
  as mean ± SEM (n = 60, 3 independent experiments). ns, P > 0.05, ****P < 0.0001
  (Student’s t tests). Source data are available for this figure: .'
