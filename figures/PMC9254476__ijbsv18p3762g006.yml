caption: 'The biological function of the signature on tumor biology and microenvironment:
  The result of GSVA concentrating on immune-related signaling pathway (A). GSEA validated
  enhanced activity of natural killer cell mediated immunity pathway (B). GO (C and
  E) and KEGG (D) analysis of DEGs between high-risk and low-risk groups. The comparison
  of 22 immune cells infiltration levels in high- and low-risk groups in the TCGA
  cohort (F). The correlation analysis between resting (G) and activation (H) natural
  killer cell infiltration level and risk score.'
