figure_title: KNTC1 knockdown inhibited NSCLC development in vitro
caption: 'A The cell proliferation rate was evaluated in NSCLC cell lines after transfection
  by MTT assay. B The effects of KNTC1 knockdown on cell cycle were determined by
  flow cytometry. C The effects of KNTC1 knockdown on cell apoptosis were examined
  by flow cytometry. D Human apoptosis antibody array was utilized to illustrate the
  regulation of the expression of apoptosis-related proteins by KNTC1 knockdown in
  A549 cells transfected with or without KNTC1. Protein expression was presented in
  grayscale and visualized by R studio. E The migration rate of cells was detected
  in NSCLC cell lines after transfection by transwell assay. Magnification times:
  ×200. F The migration rate of cells was detected in NSCLC cell lines after transfection
  by wound-healing assay. G The interaction between KNTC1 and AKT pathway was verified
  via the IPA analysis. H The expression of some cancer-associated factors was detected
  by western blot. Results were presented as mean ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.'
