caption: PEG3 is a biomarker for Mek/Erk/ROS/mTOR-driven HCC. (A) Venn diagram showing
  significantly changed genes at the mRNA level in liver cancer tissues between KC
  and KTC mice and between TC and KTC mice. (B) A heatmap illustrating the top 20
  gene signatures representing the relative gene expression levels in different groups.
  (C) Directed acyclic graph illustrating Protein-protein interaction (PPI) of top
  20 significantly changed genes and Kras/Mek/mTOR pathway nodes. (D) qPCR showing
  the relative expression of Peg3, Bex2, Mmp7 and Srd5a1 in different groups. (E)
  IHC demonstrating the expression of BEX2, PEG3, MMP7 and SRD5A1 in different groups.
  Cells positive for BEX2, PEG3, MMP7 and SRD5A1 signals were counted among a total
  of 500 cells on average from 3 independent tumors derived from 3 mice per group.
  Images were obtained at 10X or 40X magnification; scale bar, 250 or 50 µm. Data
  are represented by the mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ns, no significant.
  One-way ANOVA was used in D and E.
