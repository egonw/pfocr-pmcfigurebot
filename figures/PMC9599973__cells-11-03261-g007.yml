caption: Functional analysis of the gut content microbiota in mice. (A) Predicted
  abundance of the KEGG function. The abscissa is the abundance of the metabolic functions,
  the ordinate is the metabolic function at the second level of the classification,
  and the right-hand side is the first level of classification to which the function
  belongs. (B) Histogram of the metabolic function in the positive and negative coordinates.
  (C) KEGG pathway volcanoes. Red circles represent the upregulated KEGG pathways,
  blue circles represent the downregulated KEGG pathways. (D) PCoA diagram of the
  KEGG functional units. (E) Dumbbell diagram of the KEGG pathway with significant
  differences. (F) MetaCyc pathway volcanoes. Red circles represent the upregulated
  MetaCyc pathways, blue circles represent the downregulated MetaCyc pathways. (G)
  PCoA diagram of the MetaCyc functional units. (H) Dumbbell diagram of the MetaCyc
  pathway with significant differences. (I) Interaction network of the “Characteristic
  bacterium Lactobacillus intestinalis-metabolic pathway”. (J) Interaction network
  of the “Characteristic bacterium Bacteroides acidifaciens-metabolic pathway”. The
  solid line represents the positive correlation and the dashed line represents the
  negative correlation. CC, control group (n = 5); CM, model group (n = 5).
