caption: A proposed model for EFTUD2 in IFN-induced anti-HBV effect. The binding of
  IFN-Î± to type I IFN receptor activates the JAK-STAT pathway, ISRE transcription
  is initiated through signal transduction, and ISG expression is induced. EFTUD2
  exerts its anti-HBV action through differential splicing of some ISGs, including
  Mx1, OAS1, and PKR. Furthermore, these antiviral proteins provide direct antiviral
  effects at various stages of the HBV life cycle.
