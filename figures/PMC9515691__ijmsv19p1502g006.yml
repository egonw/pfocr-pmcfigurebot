caption: The EGFR-PI3K-AKT pathway is critical for luteolin blocking the aqueous extract
  PM2.5-induced MMP2 activation. H460 cells were pretreated with LY294002 (PI3K/AKT
  inhibitor, 20 µM) or luteolin (30 µM) for 1 h following stimulated with PM2.5 (100
  µg/ml) for 24 h. Western blot showed the protein expressions of (A) EGFR, PI3K-p85,
  p-AKT, (B) MMP2, and GAPDH. Cells without PM2.5 stimulation and blockers were used
  as the control group (mock). Quantitative data are presented as the mean ± SEM of
  the experiments (n ≥ 3).
