caption: Metabolomics analysis in cells stimulated by glucose indicates that EPDR1
  tightens the glycolysis-mitochondrial metabolism coupling. Metabolomics analysis
  after 1 h of glucose (HG) stimulation in NC and Epdr1-KD INS1 832/13 cells (n = 7).
  (A) PCA for metabolites levels at HG/LG, (B) OPLS-DA loading scatter plot; it describes
  the relationship between a metabolite and the specific component, the absolute value
  of the loading indicates how much the metabolite influences the specific component
  whereas the sign of the loading indicates whether the influence is positive or negative
  on this component. Horizontal axis shows X-loadings p and the Y-loadings q of the
  predictive component (pq1). The vertical axis showing the X-loading p(o) and the
  Y-loadings s(o) for the Y-orthogonal component (poso1). Inserted in the Figure is
  the Supervised orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA)
  score plot, showing the predictive (t1) and 1st orthogonal component (to1). (C)
  Metabolic Pathway Analysis using the predictive component (VIP) of the OPLS-DA model,
  showing the metabolic pathways that explain the variance between Epdr1-KD vs. NC
  control cells. (D) Mass spectrometry measured cellular metabolites abundance in
  response to glucose (fold change HG/LG) of pyruvate and lactate. (E) Ratio of cellular
  abundance of Lactate/Pyruvate. (F) Secreted extracellular lactate concentration
  during GSIS (1 h) in NC and Epdr1-KD INS1 832/13 cells (n = 4). (G) TCA cycle scheme.
  (H) Mass spectrometry measured cellular metabolites abundance in response to glucose
  (fold change HG/LG) showing differences of TCA cycle and malate/aspartate shuttle
  metabolites such as; reduced citrate and alpha-ketoglutarate (AKGA) and increased
  aspartate in Epdr1-KD vs NC control cells. Data are mean ± SEM of n = 7 independent
  experiments. ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001 with Combat batch
  correction method followed by ANOVA on genotype.
