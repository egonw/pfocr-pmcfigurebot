figure_title: Changes in signaling pathways and identification of core molecules in
  high- and low-inflammatory response groups
caption: (A,B) GSEA revealed the top five signaling pathways that were significantly
  enriched differently between high- and low-inflammatory response groups. (A) High-inflammatory
  response group and (B) low-inflammatory response group. (C) KEGG pathway enrichment
  analysis of DEGs between high- and low-inflammatory response groups. (D) Significantly
  enriched signaling pathways and corresponding DEGs identified between high- and
  low-inflammatory response groups. (E) Identification of the core genes with the
  highest connectivity in the PPI network, the darker the color, the higher the connectivity.
