caption: Metabolic pathways play dominant role in cancer pathway dysregulation. (a)
  The number of significantly dysregulated pathways in different KEGG categories.
  (b) Boxplot shows the ratios of dysregulated pathways of different KEGG categories
  across the different cancer types. (c) Boxplot shows the sample variance of pathway
  activities of different KEGG categories in pan-cancer. (d) Performance comparison
  of cancer classification models based on all KEGG pathways and 85 metabolic pathways.
  Each box in boxplots was built on the average ROC-AUC of five-fold cross-validation
  for 100 random repeats across the pan-cancer data from TCGA. The significance tests
  of ROC-AUC between IPAM using all pathways and metabolic pathways were conducted
  using Student's t-test. (eâ€“g) Heatmap of pathways dysregulation in amino acid metabolism
  (e), carbohydrate metabolism (f), lipid metabolism (g). The red colour represent
  that the pathway is up-regulated in the cancer samples, while blue colour is down-regulated.
  The intensity of colour indicates the magnitude of dysregulation.
