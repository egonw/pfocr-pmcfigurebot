caption: 'Inflammatory responses and phagocytosis efficiency of macrophages cultured
  on samples with NIR irradiation. a) Inflammatory cytokines release levels from macrophages
  cultured on each group under NIR treatment at different power densities (Unit: W
  cm−2). &: Compare with the same group without NIR treatment; *: Different samples
  compare with each other at the same power density. b) Expression of inflammation‐related
  genes in macrophages cultured on the SPPM samples under NIR treatment at different
  power densities (Unit: W cm−2). c) Related genes expression in TLR4–MyD88–NF‐κB1
  signaling pathway of the SPPM group under NIR treatment (Unit: W cm−2). d) The phagocytosis
  rate of macrophages cultured on SP and SPPM samples for PS microspheres with or
  without NIR treatment at 0.5 W cm−2 and the schematic diagram of cytophagocytosis
  process. Data represent means ± SD (n = 3). Statistical significance was calculated
  by t‐test, one‐way ANOVA analysis, two‐way ANOVA analysis, and Tukey''s multiple
  comparison tests. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001. &p < 0.05; &&p < 0.01.'
