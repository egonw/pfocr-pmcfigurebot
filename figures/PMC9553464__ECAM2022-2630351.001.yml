caption: KRT80 expression was elevated in NSCLC. (a) The expression of KRT80 in primary
  tumor and normal tissues from the TCGA database were analyzed by UALCAN (http://ualcan.path.uab.edu/analysis.html).
  (b) UALCAN was utilized to explore KRT80 expression in different stages of NSCLC
  and normal patients from the TCGA database. (c) UALCAN was utilized to identify
  the expression of KRT80 from the TCGA database in different grades of NSCLC and
  normal patients. (d) qRT-PCR recognized KRT80 mRNA. (e) The Western blot estimated
  KRT80 protein level.  ∗ ∗P < 0.01 and  ∗ ∗ ∗P < 0.001.
