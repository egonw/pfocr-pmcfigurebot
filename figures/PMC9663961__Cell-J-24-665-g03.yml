caption: MiR-18a-5p was the target of CASC2 in CRC. A. StarBase software (http://starbase.sysu.edu.cn/)
  predicted a binding site between CASC2 and miR-18a-5p. B. qRT-PCR was used to detect
  the expression of miR18a-5p in CRC tissues and adjacent normal tissues (n=65). C.
  qRT-PCR was used to detect the expression of miR-18a-5p in CRC cells with CASC2
  overexpression. D. Pearson’s correlation analysis was adopted to analyze the correlation
  between CASC2 expression and miR-18a-5p expression in CRC tissue samples. E. Dual-luciferase
  reporter gene assay was employed to verify the targeting relationship between miR-18a-5p
  and CASC2. F. The interaction between CASC2 and miR-18a-5p in Colo-678 and HCT116
  cells was detected by RIP assay. The data were analyzed by Mann-Whitney test, one-way
  ANOVA or independent samples t-test. Data are represented as the mean ± SD (n=3).
