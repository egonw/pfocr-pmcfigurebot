caption: 'Cytotoxic effects induced by ethanol solvent on MDA-MB-231 and HaCaT cell
  lines. MTT assay was done after two times of incubation, 24 h (black bars) and 48 h
  (grey bars), as following: 24 and 48 h s for MDA-MB-231 cells (left graph); 24 h s
  for HaCaT cells (right graph). The ethanol range concentrations varied from 0.5
  to 3.0% v/v (Alc). Control groups: untreated cells incubated in culture medium for
  24 and 48 h s (MDA-MB-231) and for 24 h s (HaCaT). The results are expressed as
  the mean ± standard error from three independent experiments, done in triplicate,
  in relation to control groups (untreated and treated with ethanol).'
