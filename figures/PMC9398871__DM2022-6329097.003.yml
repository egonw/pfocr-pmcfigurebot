caption: circCNN2 promotes LUSC tumor growth. (a) The tumor volume in H1703 cells
  upon circCNN2 knockdown was examined via RT-qPCR. (b) Tumor weight in H1703 cells
  upon circCNN2 silencing was measured via RT-qPCR. (c) The expression of Ki67, the
  nuclear antigen representing cell proliferation, was analyzed by immunohistochemistry.
  (d) Western blot analysis was utilized to examine the protein levels of proliferation-related
  proteins (PCNA and cyclin D1) and invasion-related proteins (MMP2 and MMP9) in different
  tumor groups. ∗∗P < 0.01 compared to the sh-NC group.
