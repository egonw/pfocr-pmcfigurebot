caption: Overall study design. Dataset 118,553 containing transcriptomic data from
  the entorhinal cortex of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) individuals was imported into
  SWIM software for co-expression network analysis. Samples from symptomatic and asymptomatic
  AD individuals were stratified by sex and analyzed separately. Switch genes identified
  in males and females were analyzed further for pathway analysis, transcription factors,
  and chemical interactions. The switch genes are denoted by the blue nodes falling
  in the region R4. F-AD, females with AD; F-asymAD, asymptomatic AD females; M-AD,
  males with AD; M-asymAD, asymptomatic AD males.
