caption: 'Calcium ion transmembrane transporter activity changes in astrocytes after
  SCI through bioinformatics analysis. A Transcriptome sequencing results of astrocytes
  in the SCI day 7 group compared with those of astrocytes in the sham group (inclusion
  criteria: abs (log2FC >1, P-value <0.05). There are 3173 differentially-expressed
  genes of astrocytes, among which 1637 increase and 1536 decrease after SCI. Grin2c
  expression significantly decreases after SCI (log2FC = –9.31860, P-value = 0.00945).
  B Dot plot showing the GO functional enrichment analysis results of the differential
  expression of genes of astrocytes after SCI (inclusion criteria: P-value cut-off
  ≤0.05, q-value cut-off ≤0.05), in which transmembrane signaling receptor activity,
  passive transmembrane transporter activity, channel activity, and metal ion transmembrane
  transporter activity significantly change. C Diagram showing an interactive analysis
  of astrocytes'' GO functions. Ca2+ ion transmembrane transport activity is the key
  change in astrocyte function after SCI.'
