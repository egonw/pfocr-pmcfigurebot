caption: 'Parathyroid hormone-related peptide modulates the protein expression of
  Met receptor in HCT116 cells. Cells were treated with or without 10-8 mol/L parathyroid
  hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) for different times. The protein levels of pro-Met
  (Met precursor) and Met [tyrosine kinase receptor (RTK) mature form] were analyzed
  by Western blot to investigate whether the molecular mechanisms trigged by PTHR
  type 1 (PTHR1) after binding of PTHrP are capable of modulating the expression of
  the mature form of the RTK Met in HCT116 cells. GAPDH protein levels were determined
  as a control of the amount of proteins present in the membrane, since this protein
  is not substantially modified with the treatment by the cytokine. Graph bars represent
  the average of the results obtained from three independent experiments. GAPDH: Glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate dehydrogenase; Met: Receptor tyrosine kinase Met; PTHrP: Parathyroid
  hormone-related peptide. aP < 0.05; bP < 0.01.'
