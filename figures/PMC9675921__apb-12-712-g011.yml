caption: Panax ginseng, traditionally known as ginseng belongs to the family Araliaceae.
  Ginseng is widely distributed in India, Asian countries. One of the best-known medicinal
  plant and immunomodulator herb is P. ginseng. It is generally used as a treatment
  for different disorders. ,  The active chemical constituents () derived from the
  ginseng consist mainly of a variety of saponins, tetracyclic triterpenoids saponins
  (ginsenosides) (70), polyacetylenes (71), poly phenolic compounds (quercetin) (72),
  acidic polysaccharides.The whole plant (roots, stems, leaves) and their extracts
  are useful to boost immune system and balance immune homeostasis and improve microbial
  resistance by immune system responses. Ginseng is a diverse compound; upon treatment
  of ginseng every immune cell will respond. Oral administration of ginseng polysaccharide
  extracts improves phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages. Ginseng stimulate
  the production of nitric oxide. Along with ginseng polysaccharides and IFN-gamma
  also administered leads to enhancement of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, nitric oxide from
  macrophages. J774.1A cell line is used to activate NK-cells and T-cells by IL-12
  upon treatment murine macrophage cells with ginseng extract.Ginseng exhibit immunostimulatory
  activity in dendritic cells reported for enhancement of maturation markers of DC
  (MHC class II, CD80, CD83, CD86) and also increased IL-1, TNF-alpha production.
  ,  It also reduces maturation markers of DC (CD40, CD86, CD1a, HLA-DR) and reduces
  TNF-alpha, IL-12 and IL-12 p40 (a subunit component of IL-12) secretions. ,  Ginseng
  also show adaptive or acquired immunity, when administered orally or intraperitonially
  shows formation of IgA, IgM, IgG and IgG1 subunits. ,  Ginsenosides responded H3N2
  influenza virus by enhancement of specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, and also reported
  enhanced serum antibodies specific against Toxoplasma gondii. when injected in mice
  subcutaneously. Ginseng also effects on cell-mediated immunity by enhancing antibody
  dependent cell cytotoxicity, stimulation of T-cell multiplication, promotes the
  generation of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells. Upon treatment, ginseng radix
  produces proinflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta and INF-gamma
  by macrophages. Ginseng and ginsenoside injected to mice reduce TNF-alpha remarkably
  and show anti-arthritic activity. They also prevent staphylococcus induced sepsis
  by reducing proinflammatory cytokines via TLR signalling pathway. Ginseng also show
  anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, anti-microbial, anti-viral, anti-arthritic activity.
  It is also used as an adjuvant and plays a major role in vaccine formulations by
  enhancing immunogenicity with supplied antigens. ,  Adjuvant mixed drugs enhances
  antibody production and activate Th1 and Th2 immune responses. ,
