caption: CXCL12 signaling through ACKR3 regulates metabolites in the oxidative and
  non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. We incubated MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing
  CXCR4 or ACKR3 with 13C6 glucose and 300 ng/mL CXCL12-Î± or vehicle for 15 min and
  then harvested cells for mass spectrometry, as in . Graphs show selected metabolites
  in the pentose phosphate pathway regulated by CXCR4 and/or ACKR3 signaling. For
  each graph, different colors show the metabolite and number of incorporated 13C
  molecules plotted as area from mass spectrometry analysis. Total height of each
  bar displays the sum of all detected molecules of the listed metabolite. (A) sedoheptulose-7-phosphate
  (non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway); and (B) ribulose-5-phosphate (oxidative
  pentose phosphate pathway). * p < 0.05; *** p < 0.005.
