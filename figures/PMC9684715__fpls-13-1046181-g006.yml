caption: JR48-induced plant resistance and defense responses in Arabidopsis of different
  genotypes. (A) Bacterial growth assay on Arabidopsis leaves. Suspensions of Xcc
  8004 were infiltrated into leaves of Col-0, NahG, npr1-1, jar1-1, and ein2-1 plants
  pre-treated with sterile water (control) or JR48. Bacterial population was measured
  at 3 dpi. Values are presented as mean ± SD (n (number of leaves) ≥ 6) representative
  of three independent biological replicates. Student’s t-test was used to determine
  significant differences between Control and JR48 (**P < 0.01). (B) H2O2 accumulation
  during pathogen infection. Leaves of pre-treated Arabidopsis Col-0, NahG, npr1-1,
  jar1-1, and ein2-1 plants were infiltrated with Xcc 8004. DAB staining was performed
  at 12 hpi. Scale bar, 60 μm. (C) Callose deposition during pathogen infection. Pre-treated
  Arabidopsis of different genotypes were inoculated with Xcc 8004. Leaves were detached
  for callose staining at 12 hpi. Representative images were photographed and numbers
  of callose deposition were calculated (mean ± SD; n (number of leaves) ≥ 8; **P
  < 0.01, Student’s t-test). This experiment was repeated three times with similar
  results.
