caption: GO and KEGG enrichment analyses of BHD-BM. (a) GO enrichment analysis of
  BHD-BM genes in biological process (BP), cellular components (CC), and molecular
  function (MF). (b) BHD compounds, BM targets, and pathway network constructed by
  Cytoscape using the top 20 signaling pathways. The square nodes in the center represent
  the BHD-BM genes, the octagonal nodes in the middle ring represent the active components
  of BHD, and the outermost diamonds represent the related pathways.
