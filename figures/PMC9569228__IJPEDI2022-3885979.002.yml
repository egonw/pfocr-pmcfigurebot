caption: Pathophysiologic mechanisms of sickle cell disease. Deoxygenation leads to
  polymerization of HbS and deformation of RBCs to a sickle shape, making them less
  flexible. Broadly, RBC, leucocyte, and platelet adhesion are enhanced, and cell-to-cell
  and cell-to-endothelial interactions occur; there is an upregulation of adhesion
  proteins (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, P-selectin, and E-selectin); and damage and activation
  of the endothelium occur. RBC hemolysis releases heme and arginase which scavenge
  nitric oxide, and stimulates the release of adhesion proteins. Activated platelets
  cause neutrophils to form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which induce platelet
  and RBC aggregation; interact with sickled RBCs, neutrophils, and monocytes. Neutrophils
  also adhere to the endothelium through interaction with adhesion proteins. Monocytes
  release cytokines, platelet-activating factor, and express tissue factor which upregulate
  endothelial adhesion proteins, activate platelets, and kickstart the coagulation
  cascade. Accumulation of leukocytes, platelets, and RBCs with coagulation pathway
  activation through various mediators leads to the formation of thrombi which are
  responsible for vaso-occlusion. These events subsequently cause local ischemia and
  reperfusion injury which leads to organ dysfunction.
