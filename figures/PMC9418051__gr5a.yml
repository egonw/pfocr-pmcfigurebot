caption: Structural determination of the purified intermediate sterol 4,14-dimethylzymosterol.
  (A) The exact mass of the dehydrated precursor ion was determined by high resolution
  TOF mass spectrometry. (B–G) The 1D and 2D NMR spectra of lanosterol (reference)
  and the purified intermediate sterol. 1H spectra (B), DEPT (C–E), HMBC (F, G), and
  NOESY (H, I). 4,14-Dimethylzymosterol is referred to as “unknown” in the figures.
article_title: Sterol profiling of Leishmania parasites using a new HPLC-tandem mass
  spectrometry-based method and antifungal azoles as chemical probes reveals a key
  intermediate sterol that supports a branched ergosterol biosynthetic pathway.
