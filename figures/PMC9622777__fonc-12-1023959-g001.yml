caption: Characterization of pHLIP-STINGa (A) Schematic presentation of pHLIP-STINGa
  interaction with a membrane lipid bilayer (the pHLIP peptide is shown in dark blue
  and STINGa is shown by a red circle). In state I, pHLIP-STINGa forms an unstructured
  polymer in solution at normal pH. State II shows the interaction of pHLIP-STINGa
  with the membrane at normal pH. State III represents the transmembrane helical orientation
  of pHLIP triggered by low pH, which leads to the translocation of STINGa across
  the lipid bilayer and its release in the cytoplasm. The three states were monitored
  by changes of fluorescence (B) and CD (C) spectral signals of pHLIP-STINGa interacting
  with POPC liposomes. (D) Kinetics of fluorescence changes triggered by pH drop in
  presence of POPC liposomes is shown. pH transitions monitored by changes of fluorescence
  intensity (E) and CD (F) spectral signals are shown (experimental points and fitting
  curves, red, with 95% confidence interval, pink). (G) OCD spectra of pHLIP-STINGa
  recorded immediately after deposition of pHLIP-STINGa on the supported bilayer and
  12 hrs later, when the insertion of pHLIP-STINGa into bilayer was complete, are
  shown. (H) Activation of the IFN signaling pathway induced by pHLIP-STINGa in THP1-Blue-ISG
  cells polarized by PMA, IL-4/IL-13 into M2-type macrophages is shown. The results
  were normalized to the activity of STINGa alone at the maximum concentration tested,
  which was taken as 100%.
