caption: 'Kaempferol attenuated CCI‐induced neuropathic pain. (a) PMWT and (b) PTWL
  were measured at 0, 1, 4, 7, 14, and 21 days before and after CCI induction. Kaempferol
  relieved CCI‐induced inflammatory cytokines overexpression. (c) Levels of IL6, IL10,
  and IL1β measured by ELISA and (d) levels of LPS, PGE2, and TNF‐ɑ measured by ELISA.
  Kaempferol down‐regulated CCI‐induced overexpression of TLR4 and NF‐ĸB protein.
  (e,f) TLR4 and NF‐ĸB protein in rats spinal dorsal horn measured by western blotting.
  n = 3, *p < .05 versus sham group, and #p < .05 versus CCI group. One‐way ANOVA
  was used to determine the difference between groups'
