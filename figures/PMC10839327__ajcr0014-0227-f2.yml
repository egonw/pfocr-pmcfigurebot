caption: 'EIF4EBP1 gene expression by breast cancer characteristics. A. Histogram
  distribution of EIF4EBP1 expression in breast tumors in TCGA (1090 specimens), METABRIC
  (1094 specimens), and SCAN-B (3069 specimens). B. Breast cancer subtype. ER+HER2-
  (estrogen receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor negative tumors),
  HER2+, TNBC (triple negative breast cancer). C. Staging according to the American
  Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC). Stage is not available for the SCAN-B cohort.
  D. Grading indicated according to AJCC. Counts for boxplots are indicated in the
  x-axis. Units of EIF4EBP1 expression: TCGA - log2 transformed RSEM, METABRIC - log
  intensity levels, and SCAN-B - log2 transformed CPM. The bolded center bar within
  the box plots represents the median, the lower and upper box bounds represent the
  25th and 75th percentiles, respectively, and the lower and upper tails represent
  the minimum and maximum values, respectively.'
article_title: High EIF4EBP1 expression reflects mTOR pathway activity and cancer
  cell proliferation and is a biomarker for poor breast cancer prognosis.
