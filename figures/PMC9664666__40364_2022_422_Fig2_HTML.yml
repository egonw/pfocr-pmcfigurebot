caption: Downregulation of SGOL2 expression inhibited the malignant behaviors of HCC
  cells in vitro. A The mRNA level of SGOL2 in liver and HCC cell lines. B-C, SK-HEP-1,
  and HEP3B cells were transfected with shNC or shSGOL2 lentivirus, and the knockdown
  of SGOL2 at the mRNA and protein levels was validated by RT–PCR and Western blots,
  respectively. GAPDH was used as a loading control. D-G Invasion, migration, sphere
  formation, and colony formation assays of the SGOL2-downregulated HCC cells were
  detected and analyzed. H-I Downregulation of SGOL2 expression induced cell cycle
  arrest in the G1/S phase and activated the apoptosis of HCC cells. J SK-HEP-1, and
  HEP3B cells were transfected with shNC or shSGOL2, and the proliferation of HCC
  cells was detected at Days 0, 1, 2, and 3 by CCK-8 assays. K Effect of SGOL2 on
  the EMT in HCC cell lines. SK-HEP-1 and HEP3B cells were transfected with shNC or
  shSGOL2, and Western blots were used to detect the levels of E-cadherin, N-cadherin,
  β-catenin, Vimentin, fibronectin, and MMP9. The results are presented as the mean ± SD,
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001
