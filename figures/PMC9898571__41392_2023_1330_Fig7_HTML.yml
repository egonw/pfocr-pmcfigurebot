caption: Schematic representation of TGFβ/BMP signaling pathway in OA chondrocytes.
  TGF-β/BMP family ligands bind to type I and type II receptors on the cell surface.
  TGF-βs bind TGFβRI and TGFβRII, and BMPs bind BMPRI and BMPRII. TGFβRIII is a coreceptor
  that facilitates interaction with TβRI and TβRII. TGF-βs induce the phosphorylation
  of Smad2/3, and BMPs mediate Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation. By forming complexes with
  Smad4, phosphorylated Smad2/3 and Smad1/5/8 translocate into the nucleus to regulate
  target gene expression
