figure_title: Biogenesis and characteristic markers of extracellular vesicles
caption: EVs can be classified as exosomes, microvesicles, or apoptotic bodies. Each
  has a unique pathway of biogenesis, subsequent markers for characterization, and
  packaged cargo. Exosomes are the smallest of extracellular vesicles (30–150 nm)
  and are created through the formation of multivesicular bodies within the endosomal
  pathway. Fusion of these multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane releases
  exosomes into the extracellular space. Microvesicles are 150–1000 nm extracellular
  vesicles formed through outward budding of the plasma membrane. This process often
  involves cholesterol and/or lipid rafts. The biogenesis of apoptotic bodies occurs
  during programed cell death, leading to large 500–5000 nm vesicular structures.
