caption: rNfCB activates BV-2 microglial cells via the MyD88-dependent TLR-2/TLR-4
  pathway. BV-2 microglial cells were treated with different concentrations (20 µg/mL
  or 100 µg/mL) of active or heat-inactivated rNfCB. Cells were harvested at 6 h after
  treatment. Expression levels of TLR-2, TLR-3, and TLR-4, and the downstream adaptor
  MyD88 were analyzed via semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Bar graphs show the quantitative
  expression pattern of each gene, analyzed as the fold induction of each gene relative
  to GAPDH inthree independent experiments. One-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc
  test was performed as multiple comparisons with the negative control without treatment
  with either LPS or rNfCB. *** p < 0.0001, ** p < 0.001, * p < 0.01.
