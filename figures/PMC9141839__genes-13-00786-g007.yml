caption: The mechanism of ESD inhibiting growth of A549 lung cancer cells. Activated
  ESD by FPD5 inhibited p53 to interact with JAB1, thereby reducing p53 exportation
  from nucleus to cytoplasm. p53 inhibited the expression of CDCA8 and CDC20 and thus
  arrested the cell cycle of A549 cells at G0/G1 phase and suppressed cell growth.
