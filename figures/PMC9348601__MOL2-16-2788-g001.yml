caption: Oncogenic activation of WNT pathway upregulates RNAPOL1 machinery and its
  functional activity. (A) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) comparing human wild‐type
  mucosa to colorectal (CRC) samples from the ‘The Cancer Genome Atlas’ (TCGA) database
  (left enrichment plots) (n = 276) and analysis comparing intestinal mucosa from
  wild‐type mice to mucosa from mice with a bi‐allelic deletion of adenomatous polyposis
  coli (Apc; right enrichment plots; n = 3). Enrichment plots of indicated gene sets
  are displayed. Calculation of the normalized enrichment score (NES) is based on
  a weighted running sum statistic and computed as part of the GSEA methodology. A
  Kolmogorov–Smirnov test with 1000 permutations was used to calculate P values that
  were then corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hoechberg procedure
  (FDR). (B) mRNA expression of RNA polymerase 1 (RNAPOL1) subunits (Polr1A and Polr1B)
  and components of RNAPOL1 preinitiation complex (Rrn3 and Ubtf) in murine tumor
  organoids (MTOs) with Apc def Tgfb del Kras mut Tp53 del  relative to the expression
  in WT organoids analyzed via qPCR, representative of three independent experiments
  with similar results obtained; unpaired, two‐tailed t‐test; error bars indicate
  standard deviation (SD). (C) mRNA expression of RNAPOL1 subunits (POLR1A and POLR1B)
  and components of RNAPOL1 preinitiation complex (RRN3 and UBTF) in human primary
  CRC samples (TT) in comparison to corresponding untransformed mucosa (NT) analyzed
  via qPCR. Data show mean ± SD (n = 8 individual patient samples for POLR1A and n = 28
  for POLR1B, RRN3 and UBFT); unpaired, two‐tailed t‐test. (D) Immunohistochemical
  staining of POLR1A and UBTF in human CRC samples and corresponding untransformed
  mucosa (representative images of n = 10 biologically independent patients). Scale
  bars as indicated 1 mm. (E) Expression level of 45S pre‐rRNA in MTOs compared with
  WT organoids determined via qPCR. Data show the mean ± SD of six technical replicates.
  Results are representative of three independent experiments with similar results
  obtained; unpaired, two‐tailed t‐test. (F) Expression level of 45S pre‐rRNA in human
  CRC tumor tissue (TT) compared with normal tissue (NT) samples determined via qPCR.
  Data show mean ± SD (n = 31 individual patient samples); unpaired, two‐tailed t‐test.
