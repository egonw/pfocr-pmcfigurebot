caption: Hypoxia-associated cell apoptosis and role of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related
  factor 2 (Nrf2). A. Treatment with relaxin 2 (RLXH2) significantly reduces cell
  apoptosis. The protection offered by RLXH2 is eliminated when Nrf2 is inhibited
  and increases during activation of Nrf2. B. RLXH2 mediated cell protection and HO-1
  inhibition. NCI-N87 cells cultured overnight are treated with RLXH2 only or RLXH2
  with ZnPPIX. Treatment with ZnPPIX eliminates RLXH2 mediated cell protection. The
  results are the average of an independent experiment. C; Control group, H; Hypoxia
  group, and H+R; Hypoxia with RLXH2 treatment group.
