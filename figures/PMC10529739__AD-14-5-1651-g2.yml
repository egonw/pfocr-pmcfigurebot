caption: Molecular mechanisms of MSC senescence during aging. Several molecular mechanisms
  are associated with MSC senescence. DNA damage is a common underlying cause of MSC
  senescence in which the DNA damage response pathway is activated to block cell cycle
  progression and delay proliferative arrest. Telomeres gradually shorten with every
  cell division. Shortening of telomeres can induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
  of MSCs. Cellular senescence occurs when telomeres reach a critical length. The
  accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria is associated with an increase in oxidative
  stress in senescent MSCs. Mitochondrial dysfunction results in an accumulation of
  ROS, which leads not only to MSC senescence on its own but also to their senescence
  by impairing mitophagy. ROS increases in aged MSCs, overproduction of endogenous
  ROS, and oxidative stress damage create a positive feedback loop. Autophagy is responsible
  for clearing damaged proteins and organelles and maintaining and enhancing MSCs
  function during aging. Autophagy dysregulation will promote MSC senescence. ROS,
  reactive oxygen species.
