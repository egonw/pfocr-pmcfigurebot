caption: The biodegradable elastic conductors and semiconductors. a) Schematic synthesis
  of PGSAP prepolymer and cross‐linking with HDI to obtain PGSAP‐H polymers. b) Stress–strain
  behavior of PGSAP‐H polymer films. c) The conductivity of PGSAP‐H polyurethane films.

  DCPU. e) Biodegradable DCPU film and its high elasticity presented by stretching
  and recoiling. f) Dependence of electrical conductivity of DCPU‐0.3/1 on applied
  strains. Reproduced with permission.[] Copyright 2016, Springer Nature. g) Chemical
  structure of the biodegradable elastomer (E‐PCL) based on polycaprolactone and the
  known degradation pathway of PCL (upper). Chemical structure of the fully degradable
  semiconducting polymer, p(DPP–PPD), and the monomeric byproducts after initial cleavage
  (bottom). h) The change in saturation mobility of neat and nanoconfined p(DPP–PPD)
  during stretching to 100% strain with both parallel (left) and perpendicular (right)
  to the charge transport direction. Reproduced with permission.[] Copyright 2019,
