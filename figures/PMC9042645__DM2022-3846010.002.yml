caption: Identification of metabolic genes in BC patients between tumor and normal
  tissues. (a) Venn diagram showed the intersected metabolic genes. (b) Metabolic
  DEGs between tumor and normal tissues were demonstrated by volcano map. (c) Box
  chart displayed the top ten genes with the highest significance according to adjusted
  P value. (d) Top 10 most enriched molecular functions in GO analyses. (e) Top 10
  most enriched KEGG pathway enrichment analyses.
