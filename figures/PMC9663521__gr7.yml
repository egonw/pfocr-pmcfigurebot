caption: PTK6 may enhance SRC signaling downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases. A
  schematic showing roles of PTK6 and SRC in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling is
  illustrated. Activation of receptor tyrosine kinases results in recruitment and
  activation of PTK6 and SRC. PTK6 activates SRC, AKT, FAK, EGFR, SHP2, and ERK1/2.
  SRC activity appears to be important for the ability of PTK6 to activate the RAS-MAPK
  pathway through SHP2 activation. Although PTK6 activates AKT independent of SRC
  or EGFR activity, the activation of EGFR and FAK and possibly other substrates may
  be promoted by PTK6 through SRC activation.
