caption: Boxplots for differential expression values (Log2Fold changes, X-axis) of
  genes (Y-axis) involved in lysine biosynthesis (AK, AK/HSDH, ASADH, DHDPS (boxed),
  DHDPR, LL-DAP-AT, DAPE, DAPDC), lysine catabolism (LKD/SDH) and SAR response (ALD1,
  SARD4, FMO1) by re-analysis of 23 biotic and 70 abiotic stress RNA-seq experiments
  in soybean.
