caption: Gene expression changes following burn injury alone, inhalation injury alone,
  and combined BI injury result in significant different pathway scores within immunometabolic
  pathways. mRNA was isolated from PBMC, which was isolated from burn patients or
  healthy controls, and gene expression was evaluated using nanostring barcoding (nCounter
  Human Immune Profiling PanCancer CodeSet; 770 genes, and the Human Metabolic Gene
  CodeSet; 768 genes). Pathway scores (PS) from principal component analysis (PCA)
  of the gene expression data were generated utilizing nSolver v4.0 and R. One-way
  ANOVA with Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons was used to determine significance.
  Data shown ± SEM; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, ***, p < 0.005, ****, p < 0.001.
