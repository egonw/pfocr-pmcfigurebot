figure_title: The pseudo-GTPase domain of p190RhoGAP creates an interactive interface
  for PLXNA1 binding and facilitates p190RhoGAP activation by RND GTPases
caption: (A) Schematic illustration of p190RhoGAP-A functional domains. There are
  an N-terminal pseudo-GTPase domain (constitutive GTP-binding), four FF domains,
  two pseudo-GTPase domains (pG1 and pG2, deficient in nucleotide binding), a lipid-binding
  (LB) domain, and a C-terminal RhoGAP domain. (B) The N-GTPase domain and the C-terminal
  RhoGAP domain are involved in SEMA3-induced YAP phosphorylation. Reexpression of
  WT, RhoGAP-deleted (dGAP), N terminal GTPase-deleted (dN-GTPase), active GTPase
  (G29V), and inactive GTPase (S36N) mutant of ARHGAP35 was done in ARHGAP5/35 dKO
  cells. (C) PLXNA interacts with ARHGAP35 via the N-GTPase domain. Hemagglutinin
  (HA)–PLXNA1 and Myc-ARHGAP35 deletion mutants were co-transfected into HEK293A cells.
  HA-PLXNA1 was immunoprecipitated, and coprecipitated Myc-ARHGAP35 mutants were detected
  by Western blot. Deletion of the N-GTPase domain—but not pG1 and pG2, LB, and RhoGAP
  domains—of ARHGAP35 affects the PLXNA1 interaction. (D) Deletion of the coiled-coil
  domain, segmented GAP domains (sGAP1 and sGAP2), and RBDs of PLXNA1 abolished interaction
  between ARHGAP35 and PLXNA1. HA-tagged PLXNA1 plasmids encoding deletion mutants
  were transfected into HEK293A cells that were then treated with SEMA3. Western blot
  with HA and ARHGAP35 antibodies was used to analyze the coimmunoprecipitants. (E)
  RND binding to PLXNA1 is required for SEMA3-induced YAP phosphorylation. WT and
  RND-binding deficient (LVP → GGA) mutant mouse PLXNA1 was reexpressed in PLXNA1/2/3
  tKO cells, which were treated with SEMA3A. (F) RND1 induces YAP phosphorylation.
  Green fluorescent protein (GFP)–RND1 was transfected in HEK293A cells. GFP-RND1
  expression and YAP phosphorylation were determined. (G) Deletion of RND1/3 blocks
  SEMA3A-induced phosphorylation of YAP and LATS in HEK293A cells. (H) Interaction
  between RND and ARHGAP35 is enhanced by SEMA3 in a time-dependent manner. Flag-RND1–transfected
  HEK293A cells were treated with rSEMA3A and harvested at the indicated time. Coimmunoprecipitation
  was performed to analyze interaction between RND1 and ARHGAP35.
