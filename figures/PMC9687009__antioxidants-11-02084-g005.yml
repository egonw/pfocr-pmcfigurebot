caption: (a,c) Differential abundance score plot under the positive ion mode (a) and
  negative ion mode (c), respectively (n = 6). The x-axis represents the DA-Score,
  and the y-axis represents the KEGG metabolic pathway. The size of each dot represents
  the metabolite number, the dots are distributed on the right side of the central
  axis, and the longer the line segment is, the more the overall expression of the
  pathway tends to be up-regulated. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001. (b,d)
  Differential metabolites were classified using the KEGG databases under positive
  ion mode (b) and negative ion mode (d), respectively (n = 6). (e) Measurement of
  Fe2+, cysteine, and glutamic contents in dermal papilla cells (DPCs) after 72 h
  of treatment with BCS (1000 ÂµM) (n = 6/group). n.s. no significance; * p < 0.05;
  ** p < 0.01. (f) Clustering heat map of lipids and lipid-like molecules (n = 6).
  (g) Model depicting that the inhibited System Xc- reduces the uptake of cystine,
  driving ferroptosis.
