figure_title: Core escape pathways of MAPKi resistance in melanoma are controlled
  by miR-204-5p and miR-199b-5p
caption: 'A Schematic illustration of the experimental approach to identify the molecular
  pathways/targets regulated by oncosuppressive miRNAs impacting MAPKi resistance.
  B Volcano plots of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) coming from bulk RNA sequencing
  (RNA-seq) of A375 and M14 BRAFi-resistant cells vs. sensitive counterparts (Log2Fold
  Change>0.15 and adjusted p value < 0.05). C Venn Diagram of the commonly up-regulated
  genes of res/sens cells potentially targeted by miR-204-5p and/or miR-199b-5p. D
  Bubble plot of Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showing 20 enriched gene expression
  signatures of BRAFi resistant cells. E Box plots representing 5 pathways enriched
  in biopsies of therapy resistant patients (datasets of bulk RNA-seq numbers GSE65185
  and GSE77940): epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), degradation of the extracellular
  matrix, hypoxia, MAPK signaling pathway and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction.
  GSEA was run in preranked mode using classic as metric and 1000 permutations (FDR < 0.1,
  p value < 0.05, logfold>0.3).'
