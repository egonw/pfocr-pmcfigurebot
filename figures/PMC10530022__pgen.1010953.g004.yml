figure_title: Theoretically redundant or dispensable regulation for establishing specific
  expression patterns in RFs of the 13 genes that initiate expression at the 32-cell
  stage
caption: 'In RFs for the 13 genes, magenta indicates 55 cases of regulators that give
  theoretically redundant temporal or spatial information to target genes. For example,
  the RF for Lhx3/4 is Foxd⋀Fgf9/16/20⋀β-catenin, while Foxd⋀β-catenin and Fgf9/16/20⋀β-catenin
  can establish the same expression pattern. Note that we did not perform tests in
  which two or more factors were simultaneously removed; therefore, the above presentation
  did not necessarily mean that Lhx3 expression pattern could be reproduced by β-catenin
  alone. Meanwhile, because Efna.d antagonizes signaling by Fgf9/16/20 [,,,], the
  term “¬Efna.d” implies that Fgf9/16/20 acts. Similarly, because β-catenin antagonizes
  Gata.a activity [], the term “¬β-catenin” implies that Gata.a acts. Therefore, although
  removal of Gata.a or Fgf9/16/20, shown in cyan from the digital twin, could not
  change expression patterns theoretically, these predictions would not be reproduced
  in real embryos. Note that three upstream regulatory factors, Ets1/2, Tcf7, and
  Pem-1, are not included, but they are implicitly considered in the RFs: (1) Ets1/2
  acts as an effector of the MAPK pathway, which is regulated by Fgf9/16/20, constitutively
  active (CA) Raf and Efna.d [,,]; (2) Tcf7 acts as a positive regulator with nuclear
  β-catenin; (3) Pem-1 represses transcription by regulating the function of RNA polymerase
  II in the germ-line cells [,], which are not considered in the present study.'
