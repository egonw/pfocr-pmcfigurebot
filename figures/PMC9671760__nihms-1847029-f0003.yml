figure_title: Comparative analysis of circadian oscillating pathways highlights the
  tissue-specific response to different feeding regimens
caption: Circadian oscillating pathways (Q < 0.01, Jonckheere-Terpstra-Kendall [JTK]
  cycle) for each tissue were plotted from left to right according to (1) total number
  of (#) oscillating pathways, (2) relative percentage of (%) oscillating pathways
  to detected pathways, (3) graphical summary of the correlations of oscillating pathways
  across different feeding regimens (ribbon thickness represents the number of correlated
  pathways), (4) amplitude of oscillation, and (5) phase distribution (the numbers
  outside the circle are ZTs; the blue-colored circle from light to dark refer to
  the fasting or feeding time from 0 to 24 h with the step of 2 h; gray indicates
  the dark cycle; the numbers inside radial plot are the number of cycling pathways;
  different colors of radial plots refer to different feeding regimens as indicated
  on the top). n = 5 mice/group (see also  and ).
