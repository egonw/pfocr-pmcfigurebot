caption: Immunophenotyping characteristics of blood cell-derived microvesicles. (1)
  RMVs characterized by the cell-specific marker CD235. PS acts as an “eat-me” signal
  and prothrombotic marker. The presence of human argonaute 1-micro ribonucleic acid
  antigen in MVs has been shown to be associated with innate resistance of RBCs to
  malaria infection, whereas TER-119 antigen has a cardioprotective effect. (2) PMVs
  are recognized by the platelet-specific markers, CD41 and CD61. They exert their
  hemostatic dynamics through their PS exposure and TF expression which can initiate
  the extrinsic coagulation pathway. Interleukin 1 beta and caspase-1 presence in
  PMVs can induce vasoocclusion is sickle cell disease whereas GPIb, GPIIb/IIIa, GPIX,
  and CD9 have been associated with calcification on acute coronary syndrome and constitute
  independent predictors for thrombotic and atherothrombotic events. (3) CD3, CD19,
  and CD11a levels on LMVs show strong correlation with inflammatory diseases (e.g.,
  inflammatory autoimmune polymyositis/dermatomyositis) and are accumulated in the
  lipid-rich atherosclerotic plaques of familial hypercholesterolaemia patients. A
  range of ambiguous effects have been also proposed for LMVs on vascular homeostasis
  (CD11a) and neovascularization (sonic hedgehog protein). (4) aLMVs express CD44,
  Fas-L, CD11a, PS, and TF playing an important role on dendritic cells function,
  endothelial function impairment, vascular hyporeactivity induction, and in blood
  hemostasis. (5) Monocyte-derived MVs (MoMVs) have procoagulant activity via expression
  of the procoagulant proteins (TF and thrombomodulin) and PS on their surface. Moreover,
  MoMVs expressing CD14, CD18, and PS impact on endothelial cell dysfunction or damage
  (6) Neutrophil-derived microvesicles (NMVs) exposing PS on their outer membrane
  leaflet have been shown to activate the classic pathway of complement--. NMVs expressing
  active CD11b/CD18 integrin molecule, trigger platelet activation. miR-155 enriched
  NMVs induce cytokine release and MPO positive NMVs promote endothelial cells damage
  and vascular dysfunction. (7) Natural-killer-derived MVs (NKMVs) carry internal
  and surface molecules (e.g., perforin, granzymes, granulysin, CD40L, and miRNAs
  associated with anti-tumor activity) that can inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis
  of tumor cell lines. RMVs, Red blood cell-derived microvesicles; MoMVs, Monocyte-derived
