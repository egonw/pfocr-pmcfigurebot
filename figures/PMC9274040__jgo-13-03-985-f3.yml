caption: MALAT1 targets miR-383-5p and inhibits its expression. (A) Starbase prediction
  target; (B) the targeting relationship between MALAT1 and miR-383-5p was examined
  using a luciferase-reporter gene analysis; (C) the level of miR-383-5p was measured
  by qRT-PCR. Compared to the NC or si-NC groups, ***P<0.001. NC, normal control;
  MALAT1, metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1; qRT-PCR, quantitative
  real-time PCR.
article_title: Resveratrol inhibits the proliferation, invasion, and migration, and
  induces the apoptosis of human gastric cancer cells through the MALAT1/miR-383-5p/DDIT4
  signaling pathway.
