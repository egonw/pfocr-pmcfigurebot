caption: Analysis of sc‐RNAseq data indicates the inflammation response in the COVID‐RS
  placenta. (A) Violin plot showing the expression of IFN signalling‐related genes
  in immune cell subsets from COVID‐RS and CTRL placenta; (B) the signalling pathway
  analyses by Cellchat in all cell subsets from COVID‐RS and CTRL placenta; (C) the
  cytokine/chemokine profile in the placenta tissues and umbilical cord blood samples
  from COVID‐RS and CTRL cases; (D) CellphoneDB analysis showing the ligand–receptor
  interactions among macrophage, monocytes and trophoblast subsets in COVID‐RS and
  CTRL cases. The size of dots represents mean value and the colour shows −log(pvals
  +1e‐04)
