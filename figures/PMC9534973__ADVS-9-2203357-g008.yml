caption: 'Characteristics of serum exosome protein expression in high body fat patients
  with CRC: A) Schematic diagram of patients with CRC presenting normal body fat and
  high body fat. B) Overall survival and progression‐free survival of patients with
  normal body fat and high body fat who were treated at Tianjin Medical University
  Cancer Institute and Hospital. C) Flow chart of methods used to collect plasma and
  separate plasma exosomes from patients with CRC. D) TEM image of exosomes isolated
  from human plasma (scale bar, 100 nm). E) Size range of the plasma exosomes detected
  using NTA. (F) Heatmap of plasma exosomal proteins that were differentially expressed
  in normal and obese patients. G) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of plasma from
  obese patients compared with control normal weight patients.'
