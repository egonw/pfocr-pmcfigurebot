figure_title: FGF1 mediates LHX2-induced proliferation, migration and invasion in
  an autocrine or paracrine manner
caption: a–e FGF1 siRNA was transfected into HONE1 cells stably overexpressing LHX2
  or the empty vector. Colony-formation assay (a), wound-healing assay (b) and transwell
  migration and invasion assays (c). Western blot analysis of LHX2, FGF1 and pro-survival
  signalling pathways (d). Western blot analysis of β-catenin signalling pathway and
  EMT-related proteins (e). Each experiment was independently repeated at least three
  times. f, g HONE1 and SUNE1 cells were treated with FGF1-CM or EV-CM for the indicated
  time. Western blot analysis of pro-survival signalling pathways (f). Western blot
  analysis of β-catenin signalling pathway and EMT-related proteins (g). Each experiment
  was independently repeated at least three times. Data shown as mean ± SD. *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01. FGF1-CM FGF1-condition medium, EV empty vector.
