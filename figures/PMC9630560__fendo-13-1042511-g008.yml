caption: Mechanism of leptin receptor antagonists attenuating experimental autoimmune
  thyroiditis. Leptin binds to the leptin receptor (ObR) on the surface of T CD4+
  lymphocytes, transmits signals to the nucleus through the JAK2/STAT3 pathway (),
  promotes the transcription of RORγt, and then promotes the differentiation of T
  CD4+ lymphocytes into Th17 cells. Th17 cells mediate downstream immune responses
  through the production of IL-17, thereby leading to apoptosis/necrosis of thyroid
  cells. Treg can alleviate inflammatory response by inhibiting Th1, Th2 and Th17
  cells. Treg and Th17 cells have antagonistic developmental programs and the differentiation
  of Treg inhibits Th17 differentiation (, ). On the other hand, Allo-aca can also
  bind to ObR of Treg cells to maintain Treg proliferation (). Therefore, leptin receptor
  antagonists alleviate thyroid cell apoptosis/necrosis in experimental autoimmune
  thyroiditis by inhibiting Th17 cell differentiation and promoting Treg differentiation
  and proliferation.
