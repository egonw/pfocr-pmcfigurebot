figure_title: Aberrant metabolomic and metagenomic patterns in IBS patients with and
  without depression
caption: a, b PLS-DA score plots based on the serum metabolomic profiles of 259 IBS
  patients (including 181 rIBS, 62 mIBS, and 16 sIBS) and 66 healthy controls form
  the discovery cohort in both positive and negative ionization modes. c, d PLS-DA
  score plots based on fecal metabolomic profiles of 264 IBS patients (including 185
  rIBS, 63 mIBS, and 16 sIBS) and 66 healthy controls form the discovery cohort in
  both positive and negative ion modes. e Differentially abundant gut microbiota species
  among rIBS, mIBS, sIBS, and HC, by using LEfSe to analyze the gut metagenomic profiles
  of individuals from the discovery cohort. f The relative abundance of L-tryptophan
  biosynthesis pathway in rIBS, mIBS, sIBS, and HC. Here the abundance of TRP production
  is inferred by analyzing the fecal metagenomic profiles of 264 IBS and 66 HC from
  the discovery cohort, not yet measured in situ. g The signal intensity of tryptophan
  in serum and feces in rIBS, mIBS, sIBS, and HC, by analyzing the serum and fecal
  targeted metabolic profiles of individuals from the discovery cohort.
