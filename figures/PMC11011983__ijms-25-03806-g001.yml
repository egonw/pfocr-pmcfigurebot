caption: 'NPC1 protein transport and NPC1 I1061T degradation pathways. (A) Transport
  of NPC1 protein under normal conditions: After immature N-linked high mannose glycans
  are added to NPC1, NPC1 folds and is transported to the Golgi apparatus, where the
  glycans mature and provide protection that prevents it from being degraded by EndoH.
  The NPC1 protein is then labeled as a lysosomal protein in the trans-Golgi network
  with mannose-6-phosphate. NPC1 is localized in the lysosomal compartment by mannose-6-phosphate
  receptors. (B) I1061T NPC1 protein degradation pathways. The I1061T mutation leads
  to misfolding of the protein, and it has been represented as the protein that is
  degraded via two pathways: via the ERAD and pathway of ubiquitination, in which
  the protein is diverted to the cytosol, ubiquitinated, and transported to the proteasome
  for degradation, and via the FAM134B-dependent ER-phagy pathway, in which the protein
  is degraded after autophagocytosis in the lysosomes.'
