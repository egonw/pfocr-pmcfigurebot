caption: GMSCs regulate IR-induced activation of the EGFR/STAT3 signaling pathway.
  (A) pEGFRTyr1068, EGFR, pSTAT3Y705, STAT3 and c-Myc expression levels in IR-treated
  skin cells for the indicated times. (B,C) pEGFRTyr1173, pEGFRTyr1068, pEGFRTyr1045,
  EGFR, pSTAT3Y705, STAT3 and c-Myc expression levels in GMSCs-CM-treated skin cells
  for 6 h after 4 and 8 Gy irradiation. (D) Measurement of the expression of Myc by
  qPCR analysis at 6 h after 4 and 8 Gy irradiation. (E–H) Measurement of the expression
  of MMP1, MMP3, MMP9 and MMP10 by qPCR analysis at 6 h after 4 and 8 Gy irradiation.
  (I) pEGFR, EGFR, pSTAT3Y705, STAT3 and c-Myc expression levels in pY-Gel+ GMSCs-treated
  skin tissues for 30 days after 50 Gy irradiation. Representative results from one
  of three independent experiments are shown. Data are expressed as the mean ± standard
  deviation. Statistical comparisons were made by two-sample Student’s t-test, using
  the SPSS 25.0 software (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01
  and *** p < 0.001.
