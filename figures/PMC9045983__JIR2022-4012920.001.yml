caption: 'Upregulation of SETDB1 in CRC is positively associated with PD-L1 expression.
  (a) The expression of SETDB1 in adjacent normal and CRC tissues in TCGA database
  analyzed by GEPIA. (b) mRNA expression of SETDB1 in CRC tissues and adjacent normal
  tissues determined by RT-qPCR (n = 36). (c) Protein expression of SETDB1 in CRC
  tissues and adjacent normal tissues determined by IHC (n = 36), scale bar: 50 μm.
  (d) mRNA expression of SETDB1 in FHC and CRC cell lines determined by RT-qPCR. (e)
  Protein expression of SETDB1 in FHC and CRC cell lines determined by RT-qPCR. (f)
  mRNA expression of PD-L1 in CRC tissues and adjacent normal tissues determined by
  RT-qPCR (n = 36). (g) Protein expression of PD-L1 in CRC tissues and adjacent normal
  tissues determined by IHC (n = 36), scale bar: 50 μm. (h) Correlation between PD-L1
  expression and SETDB1 expression in CRC tissues analyzed by Pearson''s correlation
  coefficient. (i) The correlation between the expression of SETDB1 and PD-L1 (CD274)
  in CRC based on TCGA database. In (b, c, f, g), ∗p < 0.05vs. adjacent normal tissues.
  In (d, e), ∗p < 0.05vs. FHC cell line. The cell experiment was run in triplicate
  independently.'
