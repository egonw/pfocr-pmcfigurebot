caption: 'rhALR suppressed renal inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production after
  I/R injury. The mRNA expressions of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IL-1β,
  IL-6, TNF-α, MIP-2, and MCP-1) were detected by real-time PCR at 24, 48, and 72 h
  after renal I/R injury treatment. All data were expressed as the mean ± SD. ∗P <
  0.05 vs. sham, #P < 0.05 vs. I/R+saline group.'
