caption: Effect of MLN4924 on neddylation and sRANKL-stimulated signaling pathway
  in RAW 264.7 cells (a) RAW 264.7 cell were pretreated with 110 nM MLN4924 for 30
  min, followed by treatment with sRANKL (50 ng/mL) at 5, 10, and 15 min, or (b) 33
  and 110 nM MLN4924 for 30 min, followed by treatment with sRANKL (50 ng/mL) at 15
  min. Cell lysates were collected and subjected to immunoblotting analysis for neddylation
  (APPBP1, UBA3, UBC12, and NEDD8) and sRANKL-induced pathway (phosphorylation of
  IkB-α (pIkB-α), ERK (pERK), P38 (pP38), and JNK (pJNK)). (c) RAW 264.7 cells were
  cotreated with sRANKL (50 ng/mL) and various concentrations of MLN4924 (11–110 nM)
  for 5 days. Cell lysates were collected and subjected to Western blotting with neddylation-related
  proteins (APPBP1, UBA3, UBC12, and NEDD8) and specific antibodies for sRANKL-induced
  proteins (TRAF6 and NFATc1).
