figure_title: Inhibition of BCR and non-BCR pathways in CLL cells from patients with
  BTKWT or cysteine 481 residue mutant disease after incubations with ibrutinib or
  pirtobrutinib in vitro
caption: Patient blood samples were collected into Vacutainer glass green-top blood
  collection tubes; cells were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density centrifugation and
  were incubated with pirtobrutinib and ibrutinib at two concentrations (0.1 and 1 µM)
  for 24 h. A Apoptotic cell death in primary CLL lymphocytes of four patients. Freshly
  isolated cells were incubated for 24 h with indicated concentrations of pirtobrutinib.
  Cells were stained with annexin V–FITC and propidium iodide (PI), and apoptotic
  (annexin V+) cells were determined by flow cytometry. Cell death in DMSO-treated
  samples was subtracted from inhibitor-treated samples. B–E Effect of pirtobrutinib
  on BCR pathway proteins. Protein extracts were subjected to immunoblot assays to
  determine levels of phospho-BTK (Y223), BTK, phospho-ERK (T202/Y204), ERK, phospho-S6
  (Ser235/236), and S6. F Graphs depict densitometry analysis for immunoblot results
  for phospho-BTK, BTK, phospho-ERK, ERK presented in B–E. Solid symbols represent
  the samples from cells treated with pirtobrutinib (unique patient ID followed by
  “P”), and open symbols represent samples from cells treated with ibrutinib (unique
  patient ID followed by “I”). G–I Effect of pirtobrutinib on non-BCR pathway proteins.
  Protein extracts were subjected to immunoblot assays to determine levels of phospho-NFkB,
  NFkB, Mcl-1, Bcl-XL, Bcl-2, Puma, Bax, and Bim. Vinculin was used as loading control.
  PBR pirtobrutinib, IBR ibrutinib.
