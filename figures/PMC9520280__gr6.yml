caption: 'Gene Ontology and protein network analyses showing the biological processes
  correlating with liver ascorbate levels in both males and females. (A) Biological
  processes analyses of proteins that correlated with liver ascorbate levels in both
  female and male mice using DAVID. Biological processes with Bonferroni p-value <
  0.05 are presented in the histogram. (B) Protein-protein interaction networks of
  common proteins in females and males correlating positively with liver ascorbate
  levels using STRING. Colored nodes: green = carbohydrates and fatty acids metabolisms
  (FDR = 1.52 × 10−7); red = mitochondrial complex III of the electron transport chain
  (FDR = 7.29 × 10–13); blue = iron homeostasis (FDR = 0.0343); gray = hepatic sulfotransferase
  involved in the maintenance of bile acid homeostasis. (C) Protein-protein interaction
  networks of common proteins in female and males correlating negatively with liver
  ascorbate levels using STRING. Colored nodes: red = classical complement activation
  pathway (FDR = 0.0010); blue = positive regulation of immune response (FDR = 0.0055);
  gray = associated with the extracellular matrix. The protein nomenclatures are depicted
  in the . The thick edges represent physical interactions. The thin edge represents
  co-expression in the same metabolic pathway. (For interpretation of the references
  to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this
  article.)'
