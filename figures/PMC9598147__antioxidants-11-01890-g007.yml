caption: 'Effect of CK on AMPK signaling pathway. Confluent 3T3-L1 cells, with and
  without 5 µM Dorsormorphin, were treated with CK and differentiation was induced
  for 8 days. (A) Expression of p-AMPK, AMPK, p-ACC, ACC, PPAR-γ was analyzed by Western
  blotting. (B–D) Relative protein levels of AMPK (B), ACC (C), and PPAR-γ (D) were
  measured via densitometry and analyzed using Image J software. Data were expressed
  as mean ± SD from triplicated experiments. *: p < 0.05, and ***: p < 0.001, significantly
  different from the differentiated group.'
