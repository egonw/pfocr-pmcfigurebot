caption: 'FAP activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in vitro. A–E BEZ235, a dual PI3K/mTOR
  inhibitor, attenuated the FAP overexpression-induced proliferation, migration and
  invasion of ccRCC cells, as evidenced by the CCK-8 assays A, flow cytometry assays
  B, wound-healing assays C, transwell migration assays D and transwell invasion assays
  E. F The increases in the protein levels of p-PI3K, p-AKT, and p-mTOR after FAP
  overexpression were markedly attenuated by BEZ235 treatment. #p < 0.05 vs. the FAP
  OE group'
