caption: Prediction of immunotherapy effect. (A) High-and low-score groups associated
  with the expression levels of immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-1, CTLA-4,
  PD-L1, PD-L2, LAG-3, TIM-3, TIGIT, and CD47. (B) Relations between the expression
  of RRM2 and immunoinhibitors. (C) Relation of RRM2 expression with TIDE, dysfunction,
  exclusion, MDSC, TAM-M2, and CAF. (D) Comparison of the abilities of recognized
  biomarkers or genes in predicting RRM2â€™s response to immunotherapy. (E) Correlation
  of RRM2 expression with the PI3K-AKT signal pathway. P<0.05; ** P<0.01; *** P<0.001.
