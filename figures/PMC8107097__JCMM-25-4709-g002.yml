caption: NF‐κB signalling pathway inhibition examination demonstrated rhS100A9 induced
  NP matrix degradation and inflammatory response through NF‐κB signalling pathway.
  The up‐regulated gene expressions of MMP‐3 and ADAMTS‐4 that were induced by the
  treatment of rhS100A9 for 12 hours were reversed by administration of SC75741 (A).
  The down‐regulated gene expressions of aggrecan and type II collagen that were induced
  by the treatment of rhS100A9 for 12 hours were reversed by administration of SC75741
  (B). The up‐regulated gene expressions of IL‐1, IL‐6, IL‐8 and TNF‐α that were induced
  by the treatment of rhS100A9 for 12 hours were reversed by administration of SC75741
  (C). NF‐κB, nuclear factor kappa‐B; NP, nucleus pulposus; MMP‐3, matrix metalloproteinase‐3;
  ADAMTS‐4, A distintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin‐4; SC75741, a kind
  of NF‐kB–specific inhibitor; IL‐1, interleukin‐1; IL‐6, interleukin‐6; IL‐8, interleukin‐8;
  TNF‐α, tumour necrosis factor‐alpha
