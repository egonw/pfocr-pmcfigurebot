caption: 'Chronic IMD treatment evoked behavioral phenotypes of the fruit fly. IMD
  caused alteration of the mechanosensory response: (A) scheme showing touch score
  counting; (B) the touch score; (C) gene expression of the mechanosensory pathway;
  IMD decreased the nociceptive response; (D) diagram showing the nociception assay;
  (E) the nociception behavior of male and female flies; (F) gene expression of the
  nociception pathway; IMD causes alteration of the light perception; (G) the representative
  waveform of electroretinogram (ERG) upon light on-off stimuli; (H) the quantification
  of ERG waveform; (I) gene expression of the phototransduction pathway. Error bar
  stands for standard error of the mean. The *, **, or *** denotes the p-value < 0.05,
  0.01, or 0.001 for Student’s t-test; IMD, imidacloprid of 0.125 mg/L; ∆VR, voltage
  change of electroretinogram; RPA, receptor potential amplitude. The operational
  definition of ∆VR, RPA, on-transient, and off-transient is illustrated in (G).'
