caption: 'CircNDST1 promotes thyroid cancer proliferation in vitro and in vivo. A
  Knockdown of circNDST1 using siRNA in TPC1 and KTC1 cell lines,RT-qPCR to detect
  circNDST1 and NDST1 expression. B The growth curve of the cells was measured by
  CCK8 assay. C The ability of cells to proliferate was assessed using clony formation
  assays. D EdU assay to assess cell proliferation capacity (scale bar: 1 mm). E TPC1
  cells with stably knocked down circNDST1 were used for tumorigenesis experiments
  in nude mice, and tumor volume and weight were measured. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. Data are shown as SD ± mean'
article_title: CircNDST1 promotes papillary thyroid cancer progression via its interaction
  with CSNK2A1 to activate the PI3K–Akt pathway and epithelial–mesenchymal transition.
