caption: 'Relative expression of isoflavonoid biosynthetic genes in Medicago truncatula
  at early time points of powdery mildew (PM) infection. (a) Biosynthetic pathway
  leading to medicarpin synthesis in M. truncatula (adapted from Farag et al., ; Naoumkina
  et al., ). Genes are represented in italics: PAL, phenylalanine ammonia‐lyase; CHS,
  chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; IFS, isoflavone synthase; IOMT, isoflavone
  4′‐O‐methyltransferase; 2HID, 2′‐hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase; I2H, isoflavone
  2′‐hydroxylase; IFR, isoflavone reductase; VR, vestitone reductase. Upstream pathway
  genes are depicted in maroon, central pathway genes in teal and downstream pathway
  genes in blue. (b–p) Relative expression of isoflavonoid biosynthetic genes in A17
  and R108 leaves. The x axes represent hours postinoculation (hpi) with Erisyphe pisi.
  Data represent the mean ± SEM of three independent biological replicates. Significant
  differences between infection time points compared to 0 hpi were computed using
  one‐way analysis of variance with Dunnett''s multiple comparisons test and between
  genotypes by unpaired t test (*p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤ 0.001, ****p ≤ 0.0001);
  N.D., not detected'
