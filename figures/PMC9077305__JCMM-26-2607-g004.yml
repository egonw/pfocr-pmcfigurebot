caption: 'Periplocymarin (PM) protected against transverse aortic constriction (TAC)‐induced
  cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in mice (A) Representative micrographs of HE, Masson
  and WGA staining were shown (20×). Bars: 50 μm. (B) Western blotting analysis of
  Collagen I, TGF‐β1 and ANP proteins in heart tissues. (C) The protein levels of
  p‐JAK2, JAK2, p‐STAT3 and STAT3 were measured by Western blot. n = 3. #p < 0.05,
  ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001 vs. sham group. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 vs. TAC group. Data
  were presented as the mean ± SD'
