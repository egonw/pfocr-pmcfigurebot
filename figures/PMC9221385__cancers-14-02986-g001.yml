caption: Defining the HIF-related transcriptome of paragangliomas. (a) Study design.
  Ten gene sets were obtained by correlation analysis of the indicated HIF-related
  genes and the whole RNA-seq data of PPGL included in the TCGA project (R > 0.4,
  p < 0.001). This analysis only considered upregulated genes (up). A total of 446
  genes overlapped in ≥5 gene sets. (b) Venn diagram showing overlaps of the HIF-PPGL,
  Buffa’s, Winter’s, Eustace’s and Ragnun’s HIF-related signatures. (c) Top enriched
  Gene Ontology (GO) biological process and pathway terms of HIF-PPGL signature colored
  by p-values. (d) Number of hypoxia-related genes identified in the indicated cancer
  types included in the TCGA project (Illumina HiSeq pan-cancer normalized). The number
  of genes involved in glycolysis and angiogenesis are highlighted in green and red,
  respectively. (e) t-SNE plots of TCGA-PPGL based on the expression of the genes
  included in the HIF-PPGL, Buffa’s, Winter’s, Eustace’s and Ragnun’s signatures.
  The 35 genes used for HIF-PPGL tSNE analysis (genes overlapping in ≥9 of the gene
  sets indicated in panel (a)) are indicated. ACC, adrenocortical carcinoma; BLCA,
  bladder urothelial carcinoma; BRCA, breast invasive carcinoma; CESC, cervical squamous
  cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma; CHOL, cholangiocarcinoma; COAD,
  colon adenocarcinoma; ESCA, esophageal carcinoma; HNSCC, head and neck squamous
  cell carcinoma; KIRC, kidney clear cell cancer cell carcinoma; KIRP, kidney renal
  papillary cell carcinoma; KICH, kidney chromophobe; LIHC, liver hepatocellular carcinoma;
  LUAD, lung adenocarcinoma; LUSC, lung squamous cell carcinoma; MESO, mesothelioma;
  PAAD, pancreatic adenocarcinoma; SARC, sarcoma; SKCM, skin cutaneous melanoma; STAD,
  stomach adenocarcinoma; UCEC, uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma.
