caption: 'The β-oxidation pathway of fatty acid degradation. Exogenous long-chain
  fatty acids are imported across the cell membranes via a transport/acyl-activation
  mechanism involving the outer membrane protein FadL and the inner membrane-bound
  acyl-CoA synthetase FadD (1). Upon activation, the fatty acyl-CoA enters the β-oxidation
  cycle. Four enzymatic reactions follow: a first oxidation by FadE, generating one
  FADH2 molecule (2, ACD), and three reactions carried out by the tri-functional complex
  FadBA: a hydration (3, ECH), a second oxidation generating a NADH molecule (4, HACD),
  and a final thiolytic cleavage (5, KACT), producing a molecule of acetyl-CoA. The
  acetyl-CoA is the substrate for key metabolic processes of the central metabolism.
  The enzymes of the β-oxidation cycle are shown in blue. Numbers correspond to the
  five reactions required for the activation and catabolism of FA. ACD = acyl-CoA
  dehydrogenase; ECH = enoyl-CoA hydratase; HACD = hydroxy-acyl-CoA dehydrogenase;
  KACT = ketoacyl-CoA thiolase.'
