caption: Effect of recombinant human arresten and canstatin on PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway. (A) Western blot analysis of VEGF, p-PI3K, PI3K, p-Akt, and Akt proteins
  in different groups. (B–D) Protein expression levels of VEGF, p-PI3K, and p-Akt.
  (E) Western blot analysis of p-FAK, FAK, p-ERK, and ERK proteins in different groups.
  (F,G) Protein expression levels of p-FAK and p-ERK. (H) Schematic diagram of the
  mechanism by which recombinant human arresten and canstatin could bind to cell surface
  integrins and inhibit HUVEC proliferation, migration, and tube formation. Recombinant
  arresten and canstatin reduce VEGF expression and inhibit HUVEC proliferation, migration,
  and tube formation by suppressing activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, thereby inhibiting
  angiogenesis. Data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation of triplicate
  experiments. * p < 0.05 indicates a significant difference compared to the control.
