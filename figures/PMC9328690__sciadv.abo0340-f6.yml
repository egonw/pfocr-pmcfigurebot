figure_title: Mitochondrial proteostasis stress programs local amino acid and one-carbon
  metabolism in skeletal muscle via the ATF4 transcription factor
caption: '(A) Motif enrichment analysis of the muscle-UPRmt gene signature using i-CisTarget.
  The table includes the transcription factor gene symbols, consensus binding sites,
  and their normalized enrichment scores (NES). (B) Left: Genome browser tracks of
  RNA-seq data were visualized in Integrative Genomics Viewer. Right: Expression of
  the Atf4 (qRT-PCR) in GC muscle from indicated genotypes. n = 6. (C) Mitochondrial
  respiration rates were determined on mitochondria isolated from muscles of the indicated
  mice using pyruvate or succinate as substrates. n = 3 to 5. (D) Expression of genes
  (qRT-PCR) involved in amino acid and one-carbon metabolism in GC muscles from indicated
  mice. n = 6. (E) Heatmap analysis of muscle metabolites. Capillary electrophoresis–mass
  spectrometry–based metabolite analysis was performed with GC muscles from indicated
  mice. n = 7. Red, relative increase in abundance; blue, relative decrease. ADMA,
  asymmetric dimethylarginine; NADH, reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.
  (F) Pathway analysis of ATF4-dependent metabolites using online software MetaboAnalyst
  5.0. (G) Amino acid levels in WT, LONP1 mKO, and LONP1/ATF4 DmKO muscles. n = 7.
  Color legend for the panel: white, WT; gray, LONP1 mKO; orange, LONP1/ATF4 DmKO.
  Values represent means ± SEM. *P < 0.05 versus WT controls; #P < 0.05 versus LONP1
  mKO. One-way ANOVA tests were performed.'
