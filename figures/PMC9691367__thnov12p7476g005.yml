caption: SIAIS361034 retards hair growth in a depilatory model by inhibiting the Hh
  pathway activity. (A) Plasma concentrations of SIAIS361034 after a single 2 mg/kg
  intravenous (i.v.) injection, 10 mg/kg intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection or 10 mg/kg
  oral (p.o.) administration. Data represent mean ± SD (n = 3). (B) Illustration of
  the experimental design of depilatory model. This model image was created in BioRender.com.
  (C) RT-qPCR was carried out to determine Gli1 expression in the skin samples from
  mice on indicated days after depilatory treatment. Data represent mean ± SD (n =
  3). (D) The gross phenotype of the back skin of the mice during the administration
  period. Pictures of mice are shown (n = 4). (E) The depilatory model mice were sacrificed
  for skin tissues 6 h after the last drug application. RT-qPCR was carried out to
  determine Gli1 expression in the skin samples from mice. Data represent mean ± SD
  (n = 4). (F) A representative western blot analysis of Gli1 and Bcl-xL in the skin
  samples from the mice at the end of the experiment (n = 4). β-tubulin was used as
  a protein loading control.
article_title: The PROTAC selectively degrading Bcl-xL represents a novel Hedgehog
  pathway inhibitor with capacity of combating resistance to Smoothened inhibitors
  while sparing bone growth.
