caption: 'MAPK/JNK signalling pathway mediates FGF7‐regulated ER transcriptional activity
  and hormone‐dependent breast cancer (BCa) cell growth. (A) T47D cells were serum‐starved
  in phenol red‐free medium and treated with E2 (oestrogen,10 nm) and P4 (progesterone,
  100 nm), or FGF7 (50 ng·mL−1) with both steroid hormones ± LY294002 (2 μm), or UO126
  (10 μm), or SB202190 (10 μm), or BI‐D1870 (1 μm), or SP600125 (10 μm), or SU6656
  (10 μm), or ABT‐199 (5 μm), or Magnolol (10 μm) for 6 h. relative expression of
  IRS1 and BCL2L1 (used as biomarkers of ER transcriptional activity) was analysed
  by RT‐qPCR. Each bar represents ratio to control, means ± SD (n = 3), *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.005 by Student''s t‐test. (B, C) T47D cells were cultured in 3D Matrigel
  for 14 days with E2 (10 nm) and P4 (100 nm), ± FGF7 (50 ng·mL−1), ± SP600125 (10 μm).
  Representative images were taken (scale bar: 100 μm) (B) and colony size (relative
  to CTR/non‐treated cells) (C) was analysed using imagej software. Data are presented
  as means ± SD (n = 3), **P < 0.005 by Student''s t‐test. (D) the effect of E2 and
  P4, ± FGF7, ± SP600125 treatment on proliferation of T47D cells was analysed by
  MTT assay. Data are presented as means ± SD (n = 3), **P < 0.005 by Student''s t‐test.
  (E, F) T47D and CAMA‐1 cells were treated with E2 (10 nm) and P4 (100 nm) ± FGF7
  (50 ng·mL−1) for 6 and 12 h. JunB expression was analysed by western blotting and
  densitometry. Densitometry data are presented as a ratio to control – Non‐treated
  cells, means ± SD (n = 3). (G, H) T47D and CAMA‐1 cells were treated with E2 (10 nm),
  P4 (100 nm) and FGF7 (50 ng·mL−1) ± SP600125 (10 μm) for 6 and 12 h. JunB expression
  was analysed by western blotting and densitometry. Densitometry data are presented
  as a ratio to control – Non‐treated cells, means ± SD (n = 3).'
