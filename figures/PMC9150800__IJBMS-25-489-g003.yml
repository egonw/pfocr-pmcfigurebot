caption: Cell cycle analysis of A375 human melanoma cell line after treatment with
  Humic acid (HA) and Fulvic acid (FA) (50 and 100 Âµg/ml) for 14 hr. (A) and (B) Analysis
  the results of DNA content with the flow cytometry method demonstrated that both
  HA and FA arrests treated cells in G0/G1 phase compared with the control group;
  and also increased peak of sub-G1 phase or DNA fragmentation in treated cells confirmed
  that both of them could trigger the apoptosis pathway. Data were statically analyzed
  through ANOVA (P<0.05*; significant difference and P<0.01**; highly significant
  difference)
