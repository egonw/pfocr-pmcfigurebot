caption: The association between molecular functional dynamics of B cells subsets
  and prognosis. (A) UMAP of B cells processed by the scSTAR algorithm, colored by
  sample and cluster. (B) The association between scSTAR-processed clusters and treatment
  (above) or B cell subclusters (down). The area of the ties represents the relative
  enrichment. (C) Trajectory analysis for the three scSTAR-processed clusters. Each
  point corresponds to an individual cell colored by cluster (above) or by sample
  (down). The density curves represent the distribution of each cluster. (D) Heatmap
  of scaled normalized expression for B cell function genes. (E) Pathway enrichment
  analysis of genes in scSTAR-C2 and scSTAR-C3, respectively. The bar plot showed
  the top 10 enriched GO pathways. Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) adjusted p value < 0.05.
  (F) The number of associations between all changed genes, pathways in which scSTAR-C2
  or scSTAR-C3 was involved and better or worse overall survival in the 21 tumor types.
  (G) The percentage of prognosis results predicted by scSTAR-C2 and scSTAR-C3 in
  21 cancer types.
