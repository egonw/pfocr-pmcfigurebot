caption: Visualization of OsRACK1B and OsRbohD interactions using bimolecular fluorescence
  complementation (BiFC) assay. OsRACK1B interacts with the N-terminus of OsRbohD
  inside the cytoplasm (red arrowhead) under normal conditions (top panel) and inside
  the nucleus (orange arrow) in the presence of salinity stress (second panel). In
  the control, the coexpression of OsRACK1B and OsRbohD (1-410 aa) constructs showed
  DAPI fluorescence but no YFP signals (bottom two panels). The onion epidermal cells
  were transiently transformed with the full-length OsRACK1B cds and N-terminal region
  of OsRbohD consisting of 1 to 410 amino acid sequences. Blue fluorescence from DAPI
  (4 9, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining indicates nuclei, merge, merged images
  of YFP channel, DAPI, and differential interference contrast image (DIC). Constructs
  were fused to either carboxy (YFP-C) or amino (YFP-N) terminus of YFP and vice versa.
  All constructs were under the control of the 35S promoter. Each pair of recombinant
  plasmids encoding nYFP and cYFP fusions was mixed 1:1 (w/w) and co-bombarded into
  onion epidermal cell layers. The transformed onion epidermal layers were incubated
  at 22 °C for 16–24 h. For plasmolysis, epidermal cells were incubated in liquid
  MS media containing 200 mM NaCl for 30 min following bombardment to separate cytoplasm
  from cell walls. The coexpression of nYFP with OsRbohD (1-410 aa)-cYFP serves as
  a negative control as there are no YFP signals observed. Bars = 100 μm.
