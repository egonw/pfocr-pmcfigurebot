caption: ROS‐productive neutrophils may participate in tumour angiogenesis in brain
  malignancies. (A) The tSNE view of neutrophils. (B) Violin plots of the expression
  of marker gene of neutrophil subtypes. (C) Bubble plot of gene expression in neutrophils.
  (D) KEGG pathway enriched in neutrophils. Red colour represents upregulation and
  blue colour means downregulation. (E) Metabolism pathway enriched in neutrophils.
  Red colour represents upregulation and blue colour means downregulation. (F) The
  bubble plot showed the expression of cytokines in neutrophils. (G) The bubble plot
  showed the expression of growth factors in neutrophils. (H) The bubble plot showed
  the interaction between neutrophils with ECs. Blue represents the ligand in ECs,
  red represents the receptor in neutrophils. (I) Expression of SELL in neutrophils
  was shown in the tSNE view (the up panel) and violin plot (the down panel). (J)
  The inflammatory cell death pathways of neutrophils. (K) The bubble plot showed
  the expression of ferroptosis‐related genes in neutrophils. (L) The relative proportion
  of the different types of neutrophils in GM and LC.
