caption: CCDC-PA inhibited the expression of MMPs in HSC-3 and SCC4 cells treated
  with CCDC-PA at various stoichiometric ratios for 24 h. The gene expression of Mmp-2,
  Mmp-9, Mmp-12, and Mmp-13 was analyzed by real-time PCR in (A) HSC-3 and (B) SCC4
  cells. The protein expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-12, and MMP-13 was observed by
  immunoblotting assay in (C) HSC-3 and (D) SCC4 cells. Control indicates a condition
  without treatment of CCDC-PA. 1:20, 1:10, 1:5 1:2, and 1:1 indicate the final concentration
  of PA in the CCDC system is equivalent to 2.5, 5.0, 10, 25, and 50 µg/mL respectively.
  The cropped images of blots shown in figures are used for illustrative purposes,
  full scan of the entire original gel(s) are included in the . Data are expressed
  as mean ± S.D. (n = 3), with *P< 0.05 indicating the significant difference from
  the controls.
