caption: Effects of ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 inhibitors on TNF-α-induced COX-2, mPGES-1,
  and IL-6 expression in MH7A cells. When MH7A cells were pretreated with the MEK
  inhibitor U0126 (10 µM), the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (10 µM), and the p38 inhibitor
  SB202190 (1 µM) for 1 h, the expression of TNF-α-induced COX2 (A), mPGES-1 (B),
  and IL-6 (C) in cell lysates was determined using western blot analysis. The data
  are expressed as the relative protein expression of targets/β-actin. Data are presented
  as the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments (*P < 0.05 vs. untreated. †P
  < 0.05 vs. TNF-α, ‡P < 0.05 vs. TNF-α). Effects of SPMs on the MAPK signaling pathway
  without TNF-α in MH7A cells (D). MH7A cells were cultured with 10 nM and 100 nM
  RvE1, RvD1, and MaR1 without TNF-α for 15 min. The expression of ERK, p38, JNK,
  and NF-κB in cell lysates was determined by western blot analysis.
