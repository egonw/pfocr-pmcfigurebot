caption: PI3K/AKT signaling was activated by ATRA and ATPR. (A) KEGG enrichment analysis
  of TE-sensitive genes (including TE down-regulated genes and TE up-regulated genes)
  during ATRA stress. (B) Heatmap of TE value for TE-sensitive genes enriched in the
  PI3K/AKT pathway. (C) PI3K/AKT activity was evaluated by detecting the protein expression
  of AKT and the phosphorylation level of AKT at ser473 using western blot. (D,E)
  Molm13 cells were simultaneously treated with ATRA (10 μM, (D)) or ATPR (10 μM,
  (E)) and LY294002 (10 μM), a PI3K/AKT inhibitor, for the indicated times. Cell differentiation
  was analyzed by quantifying the proportion of CD11b-positive cells by flow cytometry.
  (F,G) Apoptosis of cells treated with ATRA (F) or ATPR (G) and LY294002 was assessed
  by flow cytometry using an Annexin V-FITC/PI staining kit. In the “LY294002-pretreatment
  30 min” panel, cells were pre-treated with PI3K/AKT inhibitor (LY294002) for 30
  min, and then ATRA or ATPR were directly added to the medium containing LY294002.
  (H) Fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments (FPKM) values of apoptotic
  genes translationally regulated by ATRA. ns, not significant; * p < 0.05, ** p <
  0.01.
