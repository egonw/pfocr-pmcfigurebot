figure_title: Characterization of the IL-6 signaling pathway in human midgestational
  neocortex and dorsal forebrain organoids
caption: a IL-6 has two receptors, IL6R and IL6ST. When both of them are expressed
  in the target cell, the IL-6-dependent signaling cascade is called “classic” whereas
  when IL6R is provided extracellularly for example by a different cell in its soluble
  form, the cascade is called “trans”. b Hyper-IL-6 is a chimeric protein consisting
  of soluble IL6R (s-IL6R) and IL-6 connected to each other through a peptide linker.
  c Upon binding to IL6R and IL-6, IL6ST induces phosphorylation of JAK1, which in
  turn phosphorylates STAT3 at Y705. Then, p-Y705-STAT3 enters the nucleus and activates
  transcription. d In the developing human neocortex, IL6R is expressed exclusively
  in microglia whereas IL6STexpression can be detected in radial glia (RG) and to
  a lesser extent in intermediate progenitor cells (IPC), as well as in glial cells
  in a neocortical scRNAseq dataset (Nowakowski et al., Science, 2017). e, f IL6ST
  (magenta) immunofluorescence of human PCW13 neocortex, shows protein expression
  in the ventricular zone (VZ, e) and subventricular zone (SVZ, f) where it is associated
  with the marker of RGs Nestin (green). g IL6ST immunofluorescence is associated
  with Nestin in the VZ-like area of dorsal forebrain organoids (DFO) at day 50 of
  differentiation. h IL6ST (magenta) in human neocortex at PCW12 is weakly associated
  with PPP1R17 (green) which is used as a marker of IPCs. i, IL6ST immunofluorescence
  is weakly associated with PPP1R17 in DFOs at day 55 of differentiation. For e–i,
  the images represent maximum intensity projections of z-stacks sampled in 337 nm
  steps. The lines in the insets represent the positions from which orthogonal sections
  were sampled. Orthogonal sections for separate channels are shown underneath the
  respective inset images.
