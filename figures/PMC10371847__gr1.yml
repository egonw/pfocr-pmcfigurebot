caption: ICAM1 was identified as an attractive target for PTC and ATC(A) Venn diagram
  of differentially expressed genes in PTC gene expression profiling datasets.(B)
  Hub genes identified by cytoscape with Edge Percolated Component (EPC) method.(C)
  Boxplots compare ICAM1 mRNA levels via thyroid cancer to normal thyroid tissue.(D)
  Boxplots compare ICAM1 mRNA levels via normal thyroid tissue, classical PTC to tall
  PTC.(E) Boxplots compare ICAM1 mRNA levels via normal thyroid tissue, absence of
  lymph node metastasis to presence of lymph node metastasis.(F) Boxplots compare
  thyroid cancer ICAM1 mRNA levels via male to female.(G–I) Spearman correlation analysis
  between ICAM1 mRNA expression and thyroid differentiation score (G), Ki67(H) and
  MAPK pathway activity score (I).(J) Kaplan-Meier analysis of disease free survival
  of thyroid cancer patients according to different ICAM1 levels in TCGA cohort. Students’
  T test was employed in (C–E); ∗∗∗p < 0.001.
