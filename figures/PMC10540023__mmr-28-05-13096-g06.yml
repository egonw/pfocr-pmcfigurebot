caption: GSDMD mediates oxalate crystal-related pyroptosis in vivo. (A) Von Kossa
  staining revealed oxalate crystals in kidney of mice treated with Gly. (B) Haematoxylin
  and eosin staining demonstrated renal epithelial cell swelling, renal tubule edema
  and neutrophil infiltration in Gly treated mice. Scale bars, 50 µm. (C) Serum creatinine
  level of Gly-treated mice was examined by creatinine assay (n=6). (D) Western blot
  analysis of indicated proteins in NLRP3-GSDMD pathway in oxalated crystal mice.
  (E) The expression of same proteins was detected through immunohistochemical assays
  in mice. Scale bars, 50 µm. GSDMD, gasdermin D; Gly, glyoxylic acid; NLRP3, leucine-rich
  repeat-containing family pyrin domain-containing 3; OPN, osteopontin; Ctrl, control.
article_title: Oxalate‑induced renal pyroptotic injury and crystal formation mediated
  by NLRP3‑GSDMD signaling in vitro and in vivo.
