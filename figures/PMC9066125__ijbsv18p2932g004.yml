caption: Linc01612 down-regulates ATF3 expression and reduces p53 ubiquitin-mediated
  degradation. (A) A Volcano plot showed that the differentially expressed genes between
  Linc01612 overexpression group and control group (fold changes >2; p<0.05). (B)
  KEGG functional enrichment analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes
  were enriched in apoptotic and p53 signaling pathways. (C) A heat map showed that
  the differentially expressed genes between Linc01612 overexpression group and the
  control group. ATF3 was upregulated in Linc01612 overexpression group. (D) Relative
  mRNA level of ATF3 in Linc01612 overexpressed and control cells. (E) Expression
  of proteins associated with p53 signaling pathway were determined by western blot.
  (F) Representative microscopic images of tumor xenografts stained with p53, p21,
  Bcl2 and cleaved-caspase3. (G) SK-Hep1 Cells co-transfected with flag-p53(WT) plasmid
  and ATF3/Linc01612 plasmid and then incubated with cycloheximide (CHX) for indicated
  time points. The protein levels of p53 were quantified by western blot (upper panel)
  and relative quantitative (lower panel) analysis. (H) Ubiquitination assay showed
  that overexpression of Linc01612 partially reversed P53 ubiquitination. Values are
  expressed as the mean Â± sd, n = 3 in D. **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
