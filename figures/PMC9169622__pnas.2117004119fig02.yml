caption: 'Progesterone and 17OHP binding induced conformational changes within GPR126
  extracellular domains. (A) Schematic representation of the FlAsH-BRET assay design.
  NanoLuc (Nluc) was inserted at the N terminus of GPR126-β, and the FlAsH motif (CCPGCC)
  was incorporated in the designated positions at the ECLs of the receptor. (B) The
  maximal response of GPR126 FlAsH-BRET sensor S4 (annotated as WT) and the sensor-based
  CCPGCC mutants upon progesterone stimulation. Data are derived from the dose–response
  curves in SI Appendix, Fig. S4E, normalized to the maximal response of sensor S4.
  Values are the mean ± SEM from three independent experiments performed in triplicate.
  Data information: (B) ***P < 0.001; ND, not detectable; FlAsH-BRET sensors stimulated
  with progesterone were compared with those stimulated with control vehicle.'
