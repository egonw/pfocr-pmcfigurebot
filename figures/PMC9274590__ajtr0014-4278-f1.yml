caption: 'Moxibustion improved the physical signs, reduced the intestinal tissue damage
  and increased tight junction protein expression in 5-Fu-induced IM rats. (A) Body
  weights, (B) food consumption and (C) DAI scores of rats in the six groups after
  0-9 days of chemotherapy. The points represent the mean ± SEMs (n = 6 per group).
  (D) Representative HE staining images showing the pathological changes in ileum
  and colon tissues. Scale bar: 200 μm. A quantitative analysis of (E-G) the ileal
  villus height, crypt depth, mucosal thickness and (H) colonic mucosal thickness
  indicated that moxibustion alleviated the intestinal mucosal villus shortening,
  crypt shallowing and mucosal thinning caused by 5-Fu. The bars represent the means
  ± SEMs (n = 6 per group). aP < 0.05 and bP < 0.01 vs the Control group; cP < 0.05
  and dP < 0.01 vs the 5-Fu group; eP < 0.05 and fP < 0.01 vs the 5-Fu+Moxibustion-15
  min/day group.'
