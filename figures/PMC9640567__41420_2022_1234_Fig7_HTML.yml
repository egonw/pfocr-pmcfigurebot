figure_title: Enforced expression of SHIP2 rescues the LINC01468 metabolic phenotypes
caption: A Western blotting analysis of the SHIP2/Akt/mTOR pathway protein in SNU-449
  cells cotransfected with or without shLINC01468, together with shSHIP2 or empty
  vector. B Migration, invasion, ORO staining, and Nile Red staining were performed
  in SNU-449 cells as described in A. C Western blotting analysis of the SHIP2/Akt/mTOR
  pathway protein in Huh7 cells cotransfected with LINC01468 or the control, together
  with SHIP2 or empty vector. D The migration, invasion, ORO staining, and Nile red
  staining were performed in Huh7 cells as described in B. E, F Immunoblot detection
  of pmTOR level in SHIP2 E silencing in Huh7 cells or F overexpression in SNU-449
  cells. G Immunoblotting of the indicated protein lysates from Huh7 cells expressing
  Ctrl or LINC01468 treated with or without the PIP3 inhibitor PIT-1. H Migration,
  invasion, ORO staining, and Nile Red staining were performed in SNU-449 cells as
  described in G. I Expression of LINC01468/SHIP2/mTOR cascade and Ki67 in HCC xenograft
  tissues. The expression of SHIP2, pmTOR, p-4E-BP1, and Ki67 was examined by IHC.
  Scale bars, 50 μm. Sof sorafenib, EVL everolimus (the mTOR inhibitor).
