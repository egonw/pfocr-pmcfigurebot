caption: 'Different transportation mechanisms could be used for passing the BBB and
  delivering the drug to the glioblastoma cells. There are two main mechanisms for
  transporting molecules through the BBB: the paracellular pathway and the transcellular
  pathway which contains four different subparts: Receptor-mediated transcytosis,
  adsorptive-mediated, carrier/transporter-mediated transcytosis, and cell-mediated
  transcytosis. Reprinted with permission from [].'
