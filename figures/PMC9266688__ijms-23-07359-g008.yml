caption: 'Proposed schematic diagram of activated α1-NKA Signalosome mediated NASH-related
  HCC malignancy. At the onset of NAFLD, the signalosome is inactive but as NAFLD
  progresses there is generation of ROI, resulting in the activation of the signalosome
  and induction of NASH. Continuous activation of the signalosome by ROI, coupled
  with the underlying NASH microenvironment results in the amplification of ROI production
  via the EGFR-Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade, turning into a vicious cycle that intensifies
  the activation of the α1-NKA/Src signalosome which concludes in genesis of liver
  malignancy by survivin overexpression. Survivin induces carcinogenesis by inhibiting
  apoptosis, and heightening cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis. The chart
  also displays certain proteins and metabolic and morphological disarray that drive
  activated α1-NKA signalosome-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis. (Note: EGFR, Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK
  pathway symbols adapted from [] Cui and Xie, 2017; Molecules).'
