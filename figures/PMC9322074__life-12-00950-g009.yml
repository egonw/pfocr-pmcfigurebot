caption: 'The effect of melatonin on UVB-induced TIMP-1 and PIP-C production: (A)
  TIMP-1; (B) PIP-C. The cells were pretreated with 1 µM of melatonin for 1 h, further
  irradiated with 0.1 J/cm2 of UVB for 6 s, and then incubated for 0, 24, 48, and
  72 h in cell culture medium containing 1 µM of melatonin. Results are expressed
  as ng/mg protein and represented as mean ± SD of three independent experiments of
  pooled HDFs of ten healthy donors. C: untreated and non-irradiated control; M: only
  1 h of melatonin treatment; UVB: UVB-irradiated; UVB+M: UVB-irradiated after 1 h
  melatonin pretreatment. * p < 0.001.'
