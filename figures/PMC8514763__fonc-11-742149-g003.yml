caption: MiRNAs mediate chemotherapeutic resistance by multiple signaling pathways.
  Multiple miRNAs lead to drug resistance by inducing drug efflux, apoptosis inhibition,
  and abnormal glycolysis. MiR-106a, miR-630, and miR-125b inhibit apoptosis to induce
  drug resistance. MiR-93, miR-223, miR-214, miR-205, and miR-216a regulate the PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathway to inhibit apoptosis, which induces drug resistance. The IL-6/STAT3/miR-204
  feedback loop inhibits apoptosis to promote drug resistance. MiR-1180 and miR-197
  act via the Wnt signaling pathway to promote drug resistance. MiR-149-5p regulates
  the expression of MST1/2 and SAV1 to facilitate drug resistance. MiR-1307 upregulates
  the expression of ABCB1 to promote drug resistance.
