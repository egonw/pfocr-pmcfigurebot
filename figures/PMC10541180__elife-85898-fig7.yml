figure_title: Cell cycle and oxidative phosphorylation pathway activity and neoadjuvant
  everolimus response
caption: Box plots comparing cell cycle pathway activity indicated by (A) REACTOME
  cell cycle signature enrichment scores and (B) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
  (KEGG) oxidative phosphorylation signature enrichment scores between pre- and post-treatment
  samples. The left panel shows patients that were classified as responders to everolimus,
  while the right panel shows patients that were classified as non-responders. Colored
  boxes indicate interquartile range, horizontal bars indicate median, and the whiskers
  indicate first and third quartiles. p-values from paired two-tailed t-test comparing
  pre-treatment vs. post-treatment scores are indicated above the plots.
