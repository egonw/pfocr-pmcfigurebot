caption: '(A) Zinc accumulation in astrocytes and neurons brain slices was observed
  by costaining of zinc‐specific fluorescence indicator, FluoZin‐3 (green) with GFAP
  (red) and FluoZin‐3 (green) with NeuN (red) and nuclear marker (DAPI, blue). (B)
  Astrocytes are activated after cerebral ischemia, and their changes were observed
  by using an immunofluorescence staining approach 14, 21, and 28 days after cerebral
  ischemia. (C) GFAP protein expression was detected by western blotting at 14, 21,
  and 28 days after cerebral ischemia. (D) Fluorescence intensity was measured by
  costaining for a selective astrocyte marker (GFAP) and the nuclear specific marker
  DAPI. (E) Quantitative analysis of GFAP. (Scale bars: 20 μm) ns p > 0.05, **p < 0.005.
  Data are expressed as mean ± SD (n = 3/group)'
