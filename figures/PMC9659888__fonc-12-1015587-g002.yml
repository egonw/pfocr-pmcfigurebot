caption: Overview of ncRNAs involved in the regulation of the pyroptosis pathways
  in cancer. LINC00958 was found to initiate AIM2 inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis.
  By contrast, circNEIL3 prevented DNA damage-induced AIM2 inflammasome activaiton,
  thereby restraining the pyroptosis process. HOTTIP was capable of suppressing NLRP1
  inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis. miR-21-5p and GAS5 could activate the canonical
  inflammasome pathway by regulating ASC. miR-214, miR-181, miR-200b, ADAMTS9-AS2
  and MEG3 were reported to facilitate the assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome, whereas
  miR-556-5p, miR-195, SNHG7, XIST and GSEC exerted the opposite action. miR-125b
  limited the activity of caspase-1, hence blocking the canonical inflammasome pathway.
  miR-145 and miR-497 drove the pyroptosis pathway by promoting GSDMD expression or
  activation. However, RP1-85F18.6 inhibited GSDMD cleavage and thus repressed pyroptoic
  cell death. CircPUM1 negatively regulated caspase-3 to interrupt the related pyroptosis
  pathway. NEAT1 and miR-155-5p had opposite effects on GSDME-executed pyroptosis.
  DAMPs, damage-associated molecular patterns; PAMPs, pathogen-associated molecular
  patterns; AIM2, absent in melanoma 2; ASC, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein
  containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain; NLRP1, nucleotide-binding
  oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain-containing
  1; NLRP3, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor (NLR) family
  pyrin domain-containing 3; GSDMD, gasdermin D; GSDMD-N, the N-terminal domain of
  gasdermin D; IL-1β, interleukin-1β; IL-18, interleukin-18; LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  GSDME, gasdermin E; GSDME-N, the N-terminal domain of gasdermin E.
