caption: The Hermes::kanMX insertion can express gene fusions under unique circumstances.
  (A) A schematic of the Hermes::kanMX transposon showing the small ORFs that start
  at each end of the transposon and extend into the adjacent genomic DNA. TIR signifies
  the 17-bp terminal inverted repeats. (B) A schematic of the Hermes-ade7 constructions
  that fuse the ATG of the Hermes small ORFs [in panel (A)] to the second codon of
  ade7+ at the ade7 genomic locus. Hermes, with and without the short ORF ATGs, is
  fused to ade7 in both orientations. (C) An abbreviated diagram of the ORF formed
  by inserting the entire Hermes::kanMX transposon at ade7 such that the methionine
  (M) of ade7+ is replaced by the methionine of the short Hermes ORF from the left
  end (LE+ATG-ade7) or right end (RE+ATG-ade7). Because the N-terminus of the Ade7
  protein forms part of the structure of the final protein (,) (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/Q9UUB4),
  the additional amino acids of the short ORFs were not included in the fusion. In
  the –ATG constructions, the Hermes-derived ATG is mutated to TTC. (D) A diagram
  of the adenine biosynthetic pathway showing the Ade6 and Ade7 steps where mutation
  results in colored colonies. Loss or reduction in Ade6 or Ade7 enzyme activity allows
  the accumulation of the AIR intermediate, which is subsequently oxidized, conjugated
  to glutathione or amino acids and concentrated in the vacuole to result in a colored
  colony (). When grown on medium with limiting adenine, loss of activity causes formation
  of red colonies while reduced function causes formation of pink colonies. (E) Hermes::kanMX
  right end and left end ORF fusions can support gene expression. Cells lacking the
  ade7+ gene (ade7Δ, KRP389) cannot grow on synthetic medium lacking adenine and form
  red colonies on medium with limiting adenine. A representative left end-ade7 fusion
  with the Hermes-derived ATG (LE+ATG-ade7 in KRP387) grew as well as ade7+ cells
  form white or light pink colonies on medium with limiting adenine, showing that
  the ade7 ORF fusion is expressed. A representative right end-ade7+ (RE+ATG-ade7
  in KRP387) also showed expression, but the smaller colonies on medium lacking adenine
  and pink color in medium with limiting adenine suggest that ade7 expression is reduced
  compared to the left end fusions and the wild-type ade7+ gene. In contrast, the
  left end and right end fusions where Hermes-derived ATG was mutated to TTC (LE–ATG-ade7
  and RE–ATG-ade7) had the same phenotypes as the ade7Δ cells. Color balance and contrast
  of the limiting adenine pictures was adjusted to highlight the difference between
  white and pink colony color (). Analysis of independently constructed +ATG-ade7
  and –ATG-ade7 strains is shown in .
