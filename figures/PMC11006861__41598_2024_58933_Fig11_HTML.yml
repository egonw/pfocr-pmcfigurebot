caption: Bubble map of the effects of KEGG metabolic pathways in FCFS and MRS. In
  the KEGG pathway mapâ€“, the circles represent metabolites, in which the green solid
  circles are labeled as annotated metabolites, the red circles are up-regulated differential
  metabolites, the blue circles are down-regulated differential metabolites, and the
  yellow circles contain both up-regulated and down-regulated differential metabolites.
