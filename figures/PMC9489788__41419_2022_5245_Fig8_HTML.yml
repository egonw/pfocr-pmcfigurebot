figure_title: DLG4 regulates PPP through the K48-linked ubiquitination of G6PD
caption: A GSEA analysis showed that low DLG4 expression associated with pentose phosphate
  pathway, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, DNA replication and oxidative phosphorylation.
  B The mRNA levels of DLG4, G6PD, 6PGL and 6PGD were detected in SW480 cells using
  RT-qPCR, upon overexpression or knockdown of DLG4. C The expression of DLG4, G6PD,
  6PGL and 6PGD proteins levels were analyzed following DLG4 knockdown and DLG4 overexpression
  in CRC cells. D Degradation of G6PD was investigated using western blot analysis
  in a CHX chase assay in SW480 cells after DLG4 overexpression or knockdown. E The
  immunoprecipitation / western blotting assays were used to detect the ubiquitination
  levels of G6PD protein in SW480 cells after overexpression or knockdown of DLG4.
  F DLG4 induced K48-linked ubiquitination of G6PD in HEK-293T cells. G Illustration
  of the mechanism of circ_0003215 on promoting CRC pathogenesis and metastasis via
  miR-663b/DLG4/G6PD axis-mediated pentose phosphate pathway.
