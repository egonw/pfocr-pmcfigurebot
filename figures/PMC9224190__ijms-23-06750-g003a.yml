caption: Contraregulation of identified DEGs in the liver tissue between HFD- and
  HFLPD-fed animals. In total, 43 DEGs were identified in both HFD- and HFLPD-fed
  animals that were contraregulated. (a) Venn diagram of the DEGs identified among
  HFD- and HFLPD-fed animals. (b) KEGG pathway of the DEGs. (c) Heat map views of
  the DEGs detected between HFD and HFLPD animals.
