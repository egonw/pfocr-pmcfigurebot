caption: SPC25 upregulation increases the incidence of DNA damage and activates the
  PI3KDNA-PK/AKT/Notch1 signaling pathway in HCC. (A-B) Images of γH2AX immunostaining
  in indicated HCC cells 72 hours after transfection with different plasmids. (C)
  Western blot analysis of the activation levels of DNA-PK, AKT, and Notch1 signaling
  pathway in indicated HCC cells. (D) Huh7-SPC25 and Hep3B-SPC25 cells were treated
  with 5 µM AZD-7648 and 5 µM MK-2206 respectively; changes in the activation of the
  DNA-PK/AKT and Notch1 signaling pathway and the expression levels of SOX2, NANOG,
  and CD133. (E) Huh7-SPC25 and Hep3B-SPC25 cells were transfected with Notch1-specific
  siRNAs, and changes in the activation of the DNA-PK/AKT and Notch1 signaling pathway
  and the expression levels of SOX2, NANOG, and CD133. (F-G) An RBP-Jκ binding site,
  as determined by the analysis of the SOX2 and NANOG promoters. CHIP was performed
  using IgG, NICD, and RBP-Jκ antibodies, followed by quantitative RT-PCR in indicated
  cells. Error bars represent the mean ± SD. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; *** P < 0.001;
  ****P < 0.0001; ns means non-significant.
