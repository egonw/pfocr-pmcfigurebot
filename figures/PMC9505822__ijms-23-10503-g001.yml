caption: Mode of action of dual topoisomerase inhibition and PARP inhibition. The
  schematic representation shows the proposed targets of PARPi and topoisomerase inhibitors.
  PARP is involved in different DNA repair pathways, including BER and HR. Here, PARP
  contributes to the detection of lesions and the initialization of repair. Combining
  PARPi with P8-D6 causes an increase in genomic instability. P8-D6 stabilizes the
  topoisomerase I and II-DNA covalent complex, thereby leading to an increase of DNA
  damage in the form of SSBs and DSBs. By SSB repair, if DNA repair functions via
  TDP1 and PARP, the cell survives. Inhibition of PARP and/or TDP1 results in the
  accumulation of SSBs and DSBs, which can be repaired by HR. Moreover, the inhibition
  of Topo II generates DSB. If there is an HR deficiency, cells cannot be repaired
  via the HR pathway and go into induced apoptosis.
