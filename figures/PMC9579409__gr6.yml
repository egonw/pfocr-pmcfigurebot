caption: Functional analysis of common genes among the three groups with different
  BW (D36T [top 10%], D36A [average], and D36B [bottom 10%]). (A) Visualization of
  overlapping differentially expressed genes using Venn diagrams. (B) MonaGO was used
  with the Gene Ontology database to visualize genes that interacted with each pathway.
  (C) The ClueGO (v. 2.5.5, P-value ≤ 0.05, Kappa score = 0.4) plugin was used with
  the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database to visualize genes related
  to each pathway. (D) Genes upregulated in the D36T group and their biological functions
  based on the gene expression pattern calculated using Multiple Experiment Viewer.
