caption: Pathways leading to Eiger-Grnd/Wgn-mediated signaling collated from TNF-TNFR
  and Eiger-Wgn-mediated signaling pathways obtained from the KEGG databaseâ€“ and validated
  using other sources,. Red stars represent the disrupted genes in the IndCh genome,
  purple star is the gene missing in IndCh but present in IndInt, blue stars are the
  missing pathway genes in all four assembled An. stephensi genomes. The inset table
  shows the status of the genes in all 4 strains (IndInt, IndCh, UCI and STE2) of
  An. stephensi for which a high-quality genome is available.

  stephensi) likely to influence Plasmodium resistance.
