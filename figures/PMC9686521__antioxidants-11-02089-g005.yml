caption: Narcissoside (NCS) attenuated 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced phosphorylation
  of JNK and p38, but enhanced ERK1/2 and Akt activity in SH-SY5Y cells. Cells were
  pretreated with or without 1μM NCS for 24 h and then treated with 100-μM 6-OHDA
  for 3, 6, and 9 h. Protein levels of JNK, p-JNK, p38, p-p38, ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2, Akt
  and p-Akt were determined by western blotting. The expression of β-tubulin is as
  internal loading control. (top left). The intensity of the signal was quantified
  by the ImageJ software. (right and bottom).
