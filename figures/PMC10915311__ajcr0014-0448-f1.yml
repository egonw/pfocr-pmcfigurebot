caption: NTS and its receptor 1 predicted poor pancreatic cancer prognosis. 44 neural
  factors were analyzed for prognostic power in pancreatic cancer with PROGgene database,
  and the one for NTS was shown (A, GSE71729; HR=1.53; P=0.000437). NTSR1 was assayed
  similarly (B, TCGA-PAAD; HR=1.07; P=0.0469814).
article_title: Neuron-derived neurotensin promotes pancreatic cancer invasiveness
  and gemcitabine resistance via the NTSR1/Akt pathway.
