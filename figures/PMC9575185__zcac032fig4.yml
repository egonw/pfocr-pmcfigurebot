caption: Suppressing DNA replication in selumetinib slows acquisition of resistance.
  (A) Proposed mechanism for emergence of de novo resistance in drug. Selumetinib-treated
  cells are arrested in G1 because of ERK1/2 pathway inhibition. Occasionally, cells
  escape the G1 arrest and undergo a cell cycle, but this slow proliferation is offset
  by ongoing cell death and is not detectable in the bulk population. Occasional cell
  cycle events result in DNA replication or chromosome segregation errors that give
  rise to de novo mutations, some of which bestow drug resistance. This manifests
  as the sudden appearance of a rapidly proliferating colony after a long period of
  apparent stasis. (B) Western blot analysis of COLO205 cells treated with 1 μM selumetinib
  in the presence (+) or absence (−) of 16 nM palbociclib for 24 h and with the indicated
  antibodies. The pRB panels are shown at two different intensities to make the reduction
  of pRB levels in the combined selumetinib and palbociclib condition visible. Other
  panels show total Rb, CCND1, p27 (which is also part of the active CCND1–CDK4/6
  complex) and GAPDH as a loading control. * indicates non-specific band. (C) Quantification
  of EdU-positive cells by flow cytometry in COLO205 cells treated with palbociclib
  and/or selumetinib at the indicated concentrations for 24 h before addition of 10
  μM EdU for 4 h. Percent EdU-positive cells are shown within the gates for each sample.
  (D) Quantification of EdU-positive cells in panel (C). n = 4 (two biological replicates
  each of parental COLO205 cells and single cell-derived clone 2); P-values calculated
  by t test with Welch’s correction. (E) Effect of combined treatment with selumetinib
  and palbociclib on time taken for the emergence of resistant clones in parental
  COLO205 cell line. Cells were cultured in media containing 1 μM selumetinib in the
  absence or presence of 16 nM palbociclib. Media and drug were replenished weekly,
  and the time taken for the appearance of first colony (≥50 cells) of proliferating
  cells in each well was recorded (in weeks). Twelve independent replicates were performed
  under each condition; P-values were calculated using the Mantel–Cox log-rank test
  on the principle that emergence of resistance can be represented as survival time
  of non-resistant cultures. (F) Effect of combined treatment with 1 μM selumetinib
  and 16 nM palbociclib in single-cell derivatives of COLO205 cells determined as
  in panel (E). Data for four different single-cell derivatives of COLO205 are shown.
