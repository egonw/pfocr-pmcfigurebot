caption: Cell signaling network diagram for model development explanation. For a target
  protein, the proteins 1â€“3 are referred to as upstream, which can activate the target
  protein with interaction strength weight 1, weight 4, and weight 6. The target protein
  can activate proteins 4 and 5 with interaction strength weights 8 and 9, respectively.
  The solid lines indicate interactions with the target protein. The interaction with
  other proteins is represented by dotted lines
