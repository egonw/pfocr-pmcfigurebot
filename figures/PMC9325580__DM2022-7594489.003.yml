caption: COPS3 knockdown inhibited the migration as well as invasion of COAD cells.
  (a and b) Wound closure assays showed the wound healing degree of SW480 and HCT116
  cells upon the transfection of control or COPS3 siRNAs or without transfection (control).
  The representative images were shown in (a). The wound width was shown in (b). (c
  and d). Transwell assays showed the invasive SW480 and HCT116 cells upon the transfection
  of control or COPS3 siRNAs or without transfection (control). The representative
  images were shown in (c). The invasive cell number was shown in (d). Data are presented
  as mean ± SD. ∗∗p < 0.01 and ∗∗∗p < 0.001, siCOPS3 vs. siControl.
