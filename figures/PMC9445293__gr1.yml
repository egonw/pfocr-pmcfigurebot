caption: The carotenoids biosynthesis pathway in tomato. (A) The representative scheme
  of the carotenoid pathway in tomato. (B) The expression pattern of carotenoid biosynthetic
  genes in tomato fruit at different developmental stages (data were standardized
  by log10 (TPM + 1) per gene). (C) The contents of several representative carotenoids
  in the fruits of WT. Fruit samples were harvested at 10 days post-anthesis (10 DPA),
  20 DPA, immature green (IMG), mature green (MG), breaker (Br), 3 days post breaker
  stage (Br+3), Br+7, Br+10, and Br+15. Data in (B) and (C) are presented as means ± SD
  (n = 3).
