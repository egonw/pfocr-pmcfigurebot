caption: 'Validation that TLR4 is the target gene of miR-642a-5p. A: Bioinformatics
  analysis for the TLR4 and miR-642a-5p. B: Luciferase experiments of the wt-TLR4
  and miR-642a-5p. C: qPCR detection of the level of the TLR4 mRNA in miR-642a-5p
  mimic-transfected cells. D: Western Blot detection of the expression of the TLR4
  protein in miR-642a-5p mimic-transfected cells. E: qPCR detection of the level of
  the TLR4 mRNA in miR-642a-5p mimic-transfected cells induced by LPS or DEX. F: Flow
  cytometry detection of the protein expression of TLR4 on the surface of the miR-642a-5p
  mimic-transfected cells induced by LPS or DEX. n = 3. * indicates P < 0.05.'
