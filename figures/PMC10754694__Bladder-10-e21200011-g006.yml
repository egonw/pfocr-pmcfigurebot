caption: CellChat algorithm revealing macrophage communication characteristics in
  bladder cancer. (A–B) Interaction number and strength among all types of cells.
  (C–D) Interaction number among macrophages and the other cells. (E) Summary of ligand-receptor
  interactions between different cell clusters via ECM-related signaling pathways.
  (F) Chord plot demonstrating the interaction between different cell types via FN1
  signaling network. (G) Connection plot illustrating the interaction between cells
  in TME. (H) Bar plot exhibiting the relative contribution ligand-receptor in FN1
  regarding pathways. (I) Violin plots presenting FN1-related protein levels on different
  cell types. (J) Line chart displaying the measure score in a different number of
  communication patterns. (K) Heatmap demonstrating the different cell communication
  patterns in different cells and the pathway composition of each pattern.
