caption: MEHHP increases viability and decreases apoptosis in LM cells. (A–C) LM cells
  were treated with vehicle or various concentrations of MEHHP (0.16, 1.6, 16 μM)
  for 48 or 72 h. Cell viability (A), apoptosis (B), and cytotoxicity (C) were assessed
  using the ApoTox-Glo Triplex Assay kit. Values are presented as mean ± SEM (n =
  5). (D) Representative flow cytometry plots showing the percentage of apoptotic
  cells. LM cells were treated with vehicle or MEHHP (1.6 μM) for 48 h followed by
  Annexin-V and PI staining and flow cytometry analysis. (E) Bar graph showing the
  relative ratio of apoptotic LM cells after treatment with MEHHP vs. vehicle. Values
  are presented as mean ± SEM (n = 7). (F) Representative flow cytometry plots showing
  the distribution of LM cells in different phases of the cell cycle. Cells were treated
  with vehicle or MEHHP (1.6 μM) for 72 h and BrdU was added for the last 24 h. The
  cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. (G) Bar graph showing the relative ratio
  of LM cells in S phase after treatment with MEHHP vs. vehicle. Values are presented
  as mean ± SEM (n = 8). Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t test
  or Dennett’s multiple comparison test compared with vehicle control. *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01.
