caption: Effect of baicalin treatment on the viability of MDA-MB-231 cells. MDA-MB-231
  cells were treated with 0, 12.5, 25, or 50 μM of baicalin for (A) 24 h, (B) 48 h,
  or (C) 72 h. The cell viability was determined using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay.
  The cell viability of untreated cells was set as 100%. Results are presented as
  mean ± standard deviation, *P < .05 vs untreated cells.
article_title: Baicalin suppresses the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells
  via the TGF-β/lncRNA-MALAT1/miR-200c signaling pathway.
