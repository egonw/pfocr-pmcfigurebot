caption: 'Inhibition of RIP2/NF‐κB signaling pathway inhibits RIP2‐induced TMZ resistance
  in glioma cells. (A) Vector, RIP2 plasmid, RIP2 plasmid+SC75741, and RIP2 plasmid+GSK583
  cells were treated with TMZ for 72 h, and cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry.
  **P < 0.01 compared with vector+TMZ group. ##P < 0.01 compared with the RIP2 plasmid+TMZ
  group. (B) Vector, RIP2 plasmid, RIP2 plasmid+SC75741, and RIP2 plasmid+GSK583 groups
  were treated with gradient concentrations of TMZ for 72 h, and cell viability was
  detected by CCK‐8 experiment. (C) Cells in control, rRIP2, rRIP2 + SC75741, and
  rRIP2 + GSK583 groups were treated with TMZ for 72 h, and cell apoptosis in each
  group was detected by flow cytometry. **P < 0.01 compared with the control+TMZ group.
  ##P < 0.01 compared with the rRIP2 + TMZ group. (D) Cells in control, rRIP2, rRIP2 + SC75741,
  and rRIP2 + GSK583 groups were treated with gradient concentrations of TMZ for 72 h,
  and cell viability was detected by CCK‐8 assay.'
