caption: Resistance to erlotinib can be rescued in MDA-MB-468 cells via the synergistic
  targeting of AKT activity. MDA-MB-468 cells were treated with inhibitors and subjected
  to colony-forming assays over 10–14 days, with media and inhibitors refreshed every
  4 days. (A) Heatmaps of percent inhibition for the erlotinib + AKT inhibitor VIII
  combination treatments of the sensitive- (468S; left panel) and resistant- (468LR;
  middle panel and 468HR; right panel) cell lines. Inhibition was determined by measuring
  the surviving fraction of colony-forming assays with a matrix of concentrations
  (0 µM, 0.001 µM, 0.01 µM, 0.1 µM, and 1 µM) for each inhibitor in each inhibitor
  combination. (B) Representative immunoblots of cell lysates from resistant- and
  sensitive-MDA-MB-468 cells treated with either 5 µM erlotinib and/or 5 µM AKT VIII
  inhibitor (AKT-1/2i) or with DMSO control. The corresponding quantitative densitometric
  analysis is presented in . (C) Heatmaps of the synergy scores (ZIP, HSA, Loewe,
  and Bliss) of the inhibitor combinations erlotinib + AKT VIII inhibitor treatment
  for the resistant and sensitive cell lines.
