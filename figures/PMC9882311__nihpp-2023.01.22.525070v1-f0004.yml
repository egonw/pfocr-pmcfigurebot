  signaling pathways and CREB to regulate gene expression
caption: 'A) Cartoon of the AFD thermosensory signal transduction pathway. B,C,E,F)
  Quantification of DAC-1::GFP (B,E) and PYT-1::GFP (C,F) levels in adult animals
  grown at the indicated conditions in tax-4 and cmk-1 (B,C), and crh-1 (E,F) mutants.
  All reporters were tagged endogenously with GFP. Each dot is a measurement from
  a single AFD neuron. Horizontal and vertical lines indicate mean and SD, respectively.
  n = 9–85 neurons from at least two biologically independent experiments. A subset
  of WT data for DAC-1::GFP measurements is repeated from ,. *** indicates different
  at p<0.001 (one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons correction – DAC-1::GFP,
  Mann-Whitney test – PYT-1::GFP); ns – not significant. Numbers at top indicate fold-change
  between indicated conditions. D) Schematic of the analysis pipeline used to predict
  transcription factor binding sites upstream of temperature-regulated genes (see
  ). PWM: position weight matrix. G) Quantification of endogenously tagged F08H9.4::GFP
  levels in adult animals grown at the indicated conditions in crh-1 mutants. Each
  dot is a measurement from a single AFD neuron. Horizontal and vertical lines indicate
  mean and SD, respectively. n = 20–34 neurons from at least two biologically independent
  experiments. *** indicates different at p<0.001 (Mann-Whitney test).'
