figure_title: Interaction graph and dynamic behavior of the PanNETs Boolean model
caption: a The 198 directed edges in the static interaction graph depict the regulatory
  dependencies between the 56 nodes (genes/proteins). Here, arrows show activating
  regulations while bar-headed lines depict inhibitory interactions. Linear cascades
  of interactions are represented by dashed lines between the starting and the end
  node. The color of each node depicts its association to a specific pathway. b Percentage
  distribution of PanNET phenotypes in the wild type (unperturbed) as well after introducing
  common mutations like DAXX, TSC, or MEN1 knockout (KO). The complete phenotypical
  landscape with the activity of each node can be found in the Supplementary Figs.
