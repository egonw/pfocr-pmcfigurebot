caption: BTLA signaling pathway and proportion of BTLA+pDCsA–C. Circle plot of BTLA
  signaling in healthy controls (A), pre-treatment (B), and post-treatment (C) groups.
  The direction of the arrow indicates the signal sender and receiver and the color
  of the arrow is the same as that of the sender cell. The edge width corresponds
  to the strength of the ligand-receptor pairsD. Proportion of BTLA+ pDCs in healthy,
  pre- and post-treatment groupsE. Violin plot for the tolerance score of Tregs. Tolerance
  was calculated using the gene set from GO:0002645 (termed ‘positive regulation of
  tolerance induction’). Asterisks denote the significance of the differences between
  the groups calculated using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. p ≤ 0.05 (*), p ≤ 0.01 (**),
  p ≤ 0.001 (***), p ≤ 0.0001 (****), p ≥ 0.05 (ns)
