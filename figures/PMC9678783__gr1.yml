caption: 'FVS affected the Nrf2-Keap1/ARE pathway in the liver and ovary. (A) The
  mRNA abundance of Nrf2, Keap1, and downstream genes in the liver and ovary. (B)
  Effects of FVS on the protein levels of Nrf2, Keap1 and HO-1 in the liver. (C) Effects
  of FVS on the protein levels of Nrf2, Keap1 and HO-1 in the ovary. Abbreviations:
  Nrf2, nuclear factor E2-related factor 2; Keap1, kelch-like ECH-associated protein
  1; sMaf, small Maf protein; HO-1, heme oxygenase 1; NQO1, NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase
  1; GPX1, glutathione peroxidase 1; SOD1, superoxide dismutase 1; CON, laying hens
  fed with a basic diet; 2%FVS, laying hens fed with a basic diet supplemented with
  20 g/kg FVS; 4%FVS, laying hens fed with a basic diet supplemented with 40 g/kg
  FVS; 6%FVS, laying hens fed with a basic diet supplemented with 60 g/kg FVS. The
  results are expressed as the mean ± SEM (n = 4); *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01.'
