caption: DNA methylation is essential for vernalization pathway in wheat and barley.
  The expression of TaVRN2 is down-regulated by vernalization. TaVRN2 represses the
  expression of TaVRN1 by increasing the level of H3K27me3 at TaVRN1 promoter. Furthermore,
  vernalization causes an enrichment in the level of H3K4me3 at the TaVRN1 and TaVRN3/TaFT1
  promoters to up-regulate their expression. In addition, the level of H3K4me3 is
  up-regulated and the level of H3K27me3 at the HvVRN1 promoter is down-regulated
  by vernalization to increase its transcription.
