caption: Lactobacillus isolates are highly divergent, displaying global differences
  in metabolic potential. Taxonomic classification of representative draft genomes
  for L. reuteri (A), L. murinus (B), and L. johnsonii (C) queried against the NCBI
  non-redundant prokaryotic genomes database with p-values representing confidence
  of phylogenetic assignment. Dâ€“F Nearest subspecies phylogenetic neighbor of each
  Lactobacillus draft genome determined by percent shared genomic content graphed
  as average nucleotide identity (ANI) verses average amino acid identity (AAI). G
  AAI represented as a phylogenetic tree of Lactobacillus isolates and publicly available
  reference genomes for strains of the same species. Color ranges denote each species
  with L. reuteri in blue, L. murinus in red, and L. johnsonii in green with direct
  isolates and nearest subspecies phylogenetic neighbors labeled in red. Outer color
  strip specifies originating host for each isolate. H Pie chart of core and accessory
  inferred proteomic elements between isolates leveraged for I KEGG pathway enrichment
  analysis of the L. reuteri identified accessory genome. (Top 25 enriched pathways
  at p.adjusted<0.05) J Heatmap of top 20 clusters of orthologous genes (COG) abundance
  profiles for Lactobacillus isolates and nearest phylogenetic neighbors with warmer
  colors indicating increasing number of genes assigned to each COG
