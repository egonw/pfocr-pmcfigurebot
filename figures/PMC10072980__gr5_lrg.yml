caption: '(A) Dot-plot representing the regulation pattern of the common DEGs in different
  COVID-19-related studies from the Metascape server. The y-axis represents the COVID-19-related
  studies with authors'' names. (B) The dot-plot representation of the signaling pathway
  involved with the shared DEGs. The x-axis represents the overlapping gene counts
  with the enrichment terms. The color gradient indicates the adjusted p-value distribution
  of the DEGs within those ontology terms (low: red, high: blue).'
