caption: GO and KEGG based on upregulated differentially expressed proteins (DEPs)
  annotated based on proteomics analysis using spleen samples of mice subjected either
  by normaxia or hypoxia treatments. (A), GO analysis. (B), KEGG analysis. BP, CC
  and MF represent biological pathway, cellular components and molecular function,
  respectively.
