caption: Pathway analysis of LPP, FFA, and CCCA revealed shared dysregulated pathways
  in cholesterol biosynthesis and fibrosis. Pathway analysis of significantly DEGs
  between LPP lesions (A), FFA lesions (B), CCCA lesions alone (C), when compared
  to NCs. Pathway analysis revealed core shared pathways among LPP, FFA, and CCCA
  such as pathways involved in fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis (red bars)
  and immune response and signaling (blue bars). Fibrosis pathway is also shared between
  LPP and FFA (green bar) and CCCA (not shown in top 20). Black bars represent other
  pathways. Top 20 representative pathways are shown. Analysis was performed with
  R package TCGA Biolinks with access to The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Genomic
  Data Commons (GDC).
