caption: Identification of MSC in clinical samples and variation in TGF-β2/PI3K-AKT.
  Anti-CD90 positive MACS purified MSC from tumor tissue, and the cells obtained after
  adherent culture had a typical spindle and stellate morphology (A) with the characteristic
  tri-lineage differentiation ability of MSC. The cells had the ability to differentiate
  into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes, respectively (B). The cells were
  identified using MSC-related markers, they expressed CD73, CD90, CD105, and CD166
  but not CD34, CD45, or HLA-DR (C). The FACS method was used to isolate and measure
  the proportion of MSC in 12 pairs of paired samples. The proportion of MSC was significantly
  higher in the drug-resistant group compared to the drug-sensitive group (D). The
  proportion of MSC measured by the FACS method and the immunofluorescence method
  in 12 pairs of paired samples showed consistent trends (F, G). The transcription
  of TGF-β2 was significantly higher in the drug-resistant group (H). Also, the phosphorylation
  level of related proteins in the PI3K-AKT pathway was significantly increased in
  the drug-resistant group (I, J). Data are means ± SEM *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01
