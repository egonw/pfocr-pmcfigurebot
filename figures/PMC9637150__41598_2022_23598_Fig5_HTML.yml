caption: HK2-related gene enrichment analysis. (a) The STRING was used to obtain the
  available experimentally determined HK2-binding proteins. (b) Using the GEPIA2 approach,
  we obtained the top 100 HK2-correlated genes in TCGA projects and analyzed the expression
  correlation between HK2 and selected targeting genes, including ACTR3, BZW1, CPSF2,
  GSK3B, GSPT1, KCMF1, MAPK6, NAA50, PGK1, and PSMD12. (c) The corresponding heatmap
  data in the detailed cancer types are displayed. (d) An intersection analysis of
  the HK2-binding and correlated genes was conducted. (e) Based on the HK2-binding
  and interacted genes, a KEGG pathway analysis was performed.
