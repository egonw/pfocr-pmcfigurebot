caption: The “circos plot” displays the negative correlation between significantly
  differentially methylated cytosines and metabolites related to the aminoacyl-tRNA
  biosynthesis pathway. Metabolites Val and Phe have been downregulated in metabolome
  analysis, as indicated by the blue color on the edge of the circos plot. The cytosines
  pertaining to SEPSECS gene have been hypo-methylated as well. The blue strips connecting
  metabolites and cytosines indicate a negative correlation between methylation and
  metabolite abundance when adjusted for age, sex, postmortem delay, and condition.
