caption: In vivo experiments in nude mouse models showed that TNBC growth was enhanced
  by ICOSL activated by the ICOS receptor. (A-C) H9 cells were inoculated into 6-well
  plates at 1×105/well and infected with ICOS overexpression lentivirus or negative
  control lentivirus for 72 h. The specificity and efficiency were validated by western
  blotting and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).
  (**, P<0.05). ※, H9-ICOS-negative cells were sorted and used as H9-control cells
  in the experiment. (D-G) In vivo experiments in a nude mouse model. (D) The tumor
  volume of group 4 of MDA-MB-231-ICOSL-OE + H9-ICOS-OE is significantly higher than
  the other 3 group and tumor volume of group 3 of MDA-MB-231-ICOSL-OE + H9-Con is
  significantly higher than the group 1 and 2 thereafter day 22 (*, P<0.05). (E) Five
  weeks after tumor cell inoculation, in vivo imaging analysis was performed, and
  the tumor load in Group 4 (H9-ICOS-OE cells treated with MDA-MB-231-ICOSL-OE cells)
  was the largest among all four groups. (F, G) The mice were sacrificed on Day 35,
  and the tumors were excised (**, P<0.05).
