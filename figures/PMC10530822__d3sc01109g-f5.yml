figure_title: The proposed outcome for N-terminal acetylation of HMGB1. Circulating
  bacteria stimulate the JAK/STAT1 signalling pathway. Afterwards, HMGB1 undergoes
  hyper acetylation, leading to its secretion. In the extracellular environment, N-terminal
  region acetylation impairs the targeting efficiency of heparin towards HMGB1. On
  the other hand, acetylation of Lys6 promotes rapid degradation of HMGB1 by thrombin,
  resulting in cleaved HMGB1 that fails to stimulate more severe inflammatory responses.
