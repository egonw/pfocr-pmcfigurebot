caption: Effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on IκBα expression in PEDV-infected IPEC-J2 cells.
  IPEC-J2 cells were infected with PEDV for 1 h, and then the cells were washed with
  PBS and incubated with BAY 11-7082 (10 μM) for 24 h. After this, the cells were
  collected for RT-qPCR analysis (A). Sub-confluent cells were incubated with 1,25(OH)2D3
  (20 nM) for 24 h, and the cells were collected for RT-qPCR and Western blotting
  analysis or infected with PEDV (1 MOI). After 1 h of absorption, the cells were
  washed with PBS and then cultured with or without 1,25(OH)2D3 (20 nM) for another
  24 h. Finally, the cells were collected for RT-qPCR and Western blotting analysis
  (B). * p < 0.05.
