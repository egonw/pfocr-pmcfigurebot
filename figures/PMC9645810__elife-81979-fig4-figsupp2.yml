figure_title: GO and other functional analyses of differentially expressed genes
caption: '(A) The top 10 GO biological process categories that were significantly
  altered (Fisher’s exact test ≤ 0.05). White spaces indicate that the category was
  not significantly altered in that line. (B) Spearman’s correlations between the
  RNA-seq and Ribo-seq enrichment scores within each line. (C) RNA-seq fold-changes
  and DESeq2 q-values for the remaining genes in the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  (NAD) synthesis pathway shown in . Gene names along the x-axis are colored based
  on operon membership (blank: , *: , **: , ***:  ****: ). (D) Distribution of RNA-seq
  and Ribo-seq pathway perturbation scores (PPS) for each line.'
