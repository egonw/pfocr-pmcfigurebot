caption: Sjögren's syndrome occurrence is accompanied by a downregulation of the Hippo
  signaling pathway. Western blotting analysis showed that the protein expression
  levels of E-cadherin, α-catenin, p-TAZ and TAZ were higher than those of SMGs in
  17-week-old NOD mice. *P<0.05 vs. Control. E-cad, E-cadherin; NOD, non-obese diabetic;
  p-, phosphorylated; TAZ, transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif.
