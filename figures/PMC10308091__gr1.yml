caption: 'Involvement of miR-548c-3p in metabolic syndrome. (A) Relative expression
  of miR-548c-3p and its target genes in subjects with metabolic syndrome and healthy
  controls. (B) Heatmap plot for the relative expression of miR-548c-3p and its target
  genes in metabolic syndrome patients group based on the body weight. (C–E) Correlation
  of miR-548c-3p with serum insulin, C-reactive protein (CRP) and adiponectin levels,
  respectively. (F) Receiver operative characteristic (ROC) curve of miR-548c-3p.
  (G) Proposed model for the involvement of miR-548c-3p in the pathogenesis of metabolic
  syndrome by implicating JAK/STAT signaling pathway. AUC: area under curve; AKT1:
  AKT serine/threonine kinase 1; JAK: Janus kinase; MS: metabolic syndrome; MAPK:
  mitogen-activated protein kinase; NW_MS: normal weight_metabolic syndrome; Obese_MS:
  obese_metabolic syndrome; OCP: optimal cut-off points; OW_MS: overweight_metaboloic
  syndrome; PIAS1: protein inhibitor of activated STAT 1; PIK3CB: phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  3-kinase catalytic subunit beta; PTPN11: protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor
  type 11; SHP2: Src homology-2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2;
  STAT: signal transducer and activator of transcription; SP: signaling pathway; SOCS:
  suppressor of cytokine signaling; red arrow: up-regulation; green arrow: down-regulation.
  ∗, ∗∗ and ∗∗∗ indicate significant difference at P < 0.05, P < 0.01 and P < 0.001
  respectively.'
