caption: A scheme illustrating possible mechanisms involved in gliflozin-associated
  erythrocytosis. Diabetes induces renal cortical hypoxia and intensifies medullary
  physiologic hypoxia. Animal studies show that gliflozins restore cortical oxygenation,
  likely through the inhibition of energy expenditure for SGLT-2-mediated tubular
  transport. At the same time, outer medullary hypoxia is intensified, conceivably
  due to increased solute delivery to the distal nephron, enhancing tubular transport
  in medullary thick limbs. Gliflozins increase EPO synthesis and induce reticulocytosis
  and erythrocytosis. Peritubular fibroblast-like interstitial cells at the deep cortex
  and corticicomedullary junction generate renal EPO. The scheme shows that gliflozin-associated
  intensified EPO synthesis may reflect the enhanced HIF-2-mediated EPO synthesis
  in response to intensified medullary hypoxia (a canonical pathway). A non-canonical
  pathway may also exist (Sanoâ€™s hypothesis), whereby the restoration of cortical
  hypoxia in the diabetic kidney reestablishes the capacity of the peritubular interstitial
  cells to generate EPO (a non-canonical pathway).
