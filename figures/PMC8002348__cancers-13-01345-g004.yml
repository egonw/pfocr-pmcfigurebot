caption: 'Heterogeneity in signaling pathway activity score within primary tumors
  at micro- and macro-scale (sample sets I and II). (A) Pathway activity scores for
  tissue block (blue) and quadrant (red) samples of each patient. Ranges are presented
  as vertical lines; individual scores are presented as triangles. (B) Spread in signaling
  pathway activity scores from quadrant samples (horizontal lines) vs. spread in scores
  from tissue block samples of the same patient (vertical lines). Significance level
  for the correlation between mean scores of tissue block samples versus mean scores
  of quadrant samples (point where horizontal and vertical lines cross) are indicated
  in the figure by stars (*: p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01, ***: p < 0.001, corresponding
  values are in ). (C) Correlation between mean quadrant sample pathway activity score
  and score of the corresponding tissue block sample. Stars indicate the significance
  level of the correlations (corresponding p values are in ). (B,C) Diagonal black
  lines illustrate a one-to-one relation. Samples of the same patient have the same
  color. Black lines illustrate a one-to-one relation. (D) Ratio between macro-scale
  and micro-scale standard deviation (SD) of signaling pathway activity scores; σmacro/σmicro
  measured in tissue block samples and quadrant samples, respectively. Variances computed
  using the macro- vs. micro-scale model (B, ) using all samples (top) or those with
  less technical noise (leaving out all samples with average Cq values > 31 for the
  reference genes used for the qPCR measurements). Significance level of Wald test
  p-value for comparing the ratio σmacro/σmicro to 1 are indicated by stars (p values
  for model run using all samples in ). (E) Summarized macro (block level) and micro-scale
  (quadrant level) heterogeneity per patient by taking the square root of the average
  variance across the six pathways, where an average SD of 10 means an average confidence
  interval of about 40 points. (F) Checkerboard visualization of a primary cancer,
  explaining differences in heterogeneity between micro-scale and macro-scale measurements
  of pathway activity. Left: Squares represent (small) cancer cell clones with variable
  pathway activity scores, simulated by grey (high pathway activity) and white (low
  pathway activity). For example, analyzing HH pathway activity in a randomly localized
  “tissue” sample (analogous to the tissue block samples) results in a smoothed averaged
  pathway activity, due to canceling out of variations in pathway activity that are
  present in areas smaller than the sampled area. On the other hand, when taking four
  quadrant samples, the varying pathway activity scores in the quadrants are measured,
  resulting in a higher measured pathway activity heterogeneity at micro-scale. Right:
  Quadrangles represent large cancer cell clones, with variations in pathway activity
  scores. In this case, it is expected that more heterogeneity will be found at the
  macro-scale, since the quadrants are more likely to have the same pathway activity.
  This might be the case for the PI3K-FOXO pathway. For detailed information on the
  associated statistical model, see .'
