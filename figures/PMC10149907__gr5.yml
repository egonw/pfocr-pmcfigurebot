caption: IDH1-mediated metabolic reprogramming. In general, IDH1 mutation increases
  the level of D-2HG and the expression of cancer-promoting proteins through the HIF-1α
  signal pathway. In addition, IDH1 mutation also inhibits the synthesis of ATP, results
  in a decline in antioxidant capacity, and causes erythroid cell maturation disorder
  via the inhibition of α-KG dehydrogenase. In the low-nutritional stated PDAC cells,
  the levels of IDH1 and NADPH increased, enhancing the mitochondrial function to
  maintain the growth of cancer cells. The black arrow means the promotion effects.
  The black T-shaped arrow means inhibition effects. The red arrow means the final
  effect caused by IDH1 mutations. The blue arrow means the change of IDH1 level in
  the low-nutritional stated PDAC cells and the resulting final effect. Vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF), hexokinase (HK), glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1), phosphofructokinase
  (PFK), phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), prolyl-hydroxylase (PHD), hypoxia inducible
  factors-1α (HIF-1α), hypoxia-responsive elements (HERs), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1),
  reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione (GSH).
