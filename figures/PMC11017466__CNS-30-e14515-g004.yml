caption: 'CFE inhibits 6‐OHDA‐induced cell death by regulating the MAPK signaling
  pathway in PC‐12 cells. (A) Representative Western blotting images of p‐ERK, ERK,
  p‐JNK, JNK, p‐p38, p38, and β‐Actin in PC‐12 cells treated with CFE at the indicated
  concentrations. Full unedited gel/blots are provided in Figure , where the protein
  molecular weight markers were labeled. (B–D) Bar charts indicate the ratio of p‐ERK/ERK,
  p‐JNK/JNK, and p‐p38/p38. (E) Representative Western blotting images of p‐JNK, JNK,
  p‐p38, p38, and β‐Actin in 6‐OHDA‐treated PC‐12 cells with or without CFE at the
  indicated concentrations. Full unedited gel/blots are provided in Figure , where
  the protein molecular weight markers were labeled. (F,G) Bar charts indicate the
  ratio of p‐JNK/JNK and p‐p38/p38. (H) The bar chart indicates the cell viability
  of 6‐OHDA‐treated PC‐12 cells with or without CFE and SCH at the indicated concentrations.
  (I) Representative Hoechst/PI staining images of 6‐OHDA‐treated PC‐12 cells with
  or without CFE and SCH at the indicated concentrations. Magnification: 10x, Scale
  bar: 200 μm. (J) The bar chart indicates the ratio of Hoechst/PI. Error bars, S.D.,
  *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.'
