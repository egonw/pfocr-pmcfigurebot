caption: 'The expression of Wnt receptors and DCs in back skin sample of psoriatic
  mice. (a) Western blot of Frizzled-2, LRP6, and LRP5 protein levels in skin samples
  of psoriasis mice. (b) Western blot of GSK-3β, APC, and Axin2 protein levels in
  skin samples of psoriasis mice. Data are presented as the mean ± SD of three independent
  experiments performed in triplicate. ∗P < 0.0001 vs. control group; #P < 0.0001
