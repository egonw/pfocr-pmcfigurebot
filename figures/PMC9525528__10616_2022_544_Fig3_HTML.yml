caption: 'Resveratrol alleviates EMT by targeting TRAF6 and regulates HH signal. A
  MTT assay results show the cell viability at the different concentrations of resveratrol.
  B RT-PCR analysis shows the TRAF6 expression after transfection; C TRAF6 overexpression
  enhances the cell viability. D Resveratrol downregulates the increase of cell invasion
  induced by TRAF6 overexpression. E The WB analysis determines relative levels of
  factors in the HH signal pathway. F RT-PCR determines the relative expressions of
  various EMT factors (# refers to comparison with control group, # indicates P < 0.05
  and ## represents P < 0.01; * refers to comparison with Ov-ex group, * indicates
  P < 0.05 and ** represents P < 0.01; n.s. means no significant)'
