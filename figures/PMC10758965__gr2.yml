caption: 'Pro-oncogenic transcription factors upregulate one-carbon metabolism enzymes.
  One-carbon metabolism enzymes and the transcription factors that regulate them are
  split into two main groups: serine synthesis pathway (effector transcription factors
  are highlighted in orange) and nucleotide synthesis (violet). ATF4, activating transcription
  factor 4; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; E2F1, 2F transcription factor 1; FOXM1,
  forkhead box M1; LKB1, liver kinase B1; lincNMR, long intergenic noncoding rna-nucleotide
  metabolism regulator; mTORC1, mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1; NF-κB,
  nuclear factor–kappa B; YBX1, Y-box binding protein 1.c.'
