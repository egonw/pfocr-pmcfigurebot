caption: 'Activating ESD upregulated the p53 protein level in nucleus. (A–C) Western
  blot analysis of the protein level of p53 in A549 cells treated with 0, 1, and 5 µM
  FPD5 for 24 h after transfection with scramble siRNA or siRNA of ESD (siESD). (D)
  Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) of ESD with the p53 protein in A549 cells. (E) Double
  immunofluorescence staining of p53 (green) and ESD (red) showed that there was no
  agglomeration or co-localization in A549 cells. Overlay of the p53 and ESD indicated
  that there was no interaction between them. Scale bar: 20 µm. Data are mean  ±  SEM.
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, N.S., not significant, n = 3.'
