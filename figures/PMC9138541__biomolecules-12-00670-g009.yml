caption: Interactions among CAST, WNT2/WNT2B, and Lgr5. Networks (physical interactions/co-expression/predicted/co-localization/genetic
  interactions/pathway/shared protein domains) and functions (G protein-coupled receptor
  binding/canonical Wnt signaling pathway/stem cell differentiation/positive regulation
  of Wnt signaling pathway) were involved.
