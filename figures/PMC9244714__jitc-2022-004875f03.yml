caption: 'TNF pathway activation mediated p38 MAPK-eIF4E axis signaling and B7-H3
  upregulation. (A) RNA-seq heatmap represents the differential gene expressions in
  SP20H or F118A knockout cells incubated for various periods of time. The gene expression
  value in heatmap was normalized by log2-fold change in each row. (B) Bar plot shows
  the most significant enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways in D7_SP20H-knockout cells.
  (C and D) GSEA plots of indicated signature genes enriched in long-term SP20H depleted
  cells (D7_S). (E–F) SK-OV-3 and DU145 cells treated or untreated with different
  concentrations of TNF-α were analyzed for surface B7-H3 protein expression by flow
  cytometric analysis and detected for total protein expression of B7-H3, phospho-p38,
  and phospho-eIF4E by immunoblotting. At least two independent experiments were performed
  with similar results; representative data are shown. D3/D7: day3, day7; F, F118A;
  GO, Gene Ontology; GSEA, gene set enrichment analysis; S, SP20H.'
