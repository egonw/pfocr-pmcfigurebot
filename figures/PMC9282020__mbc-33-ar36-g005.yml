caption: The combination of Rapa treatment plus MetR increases fatty acid utilization.
  Metabolic flexibility is defined as the ability to maintain oxygen consumption following
  treatment with metabolic pathway pharmacological inhibitor(s). Panel (A) compares
  the OCR in response to palmitate (palm) and an inhibitor of CPT1 (etomoxir [eto])
  in early-passage versus late passage (senescent) cultures. Panel (B) shows results
  comparing late passage cultures versus late passage cultures treated with Rapa.
  Panel (C) shows the results of a comparison between methionine-restricted cultures
  and cultures subjected to the combination ofRapa plus MetR (1 mg/l) treatment. Panels
  (D) and (E) contain results of glucose utilization rates and ECARs, respectively.
  Results are representative of at least two independent experiments and significance
  (P < 0.05) in unpaired T tests between samples and is indicated by asterisks.
article_title: The methyltransferase enzymes KMT2D, SETD1B, and ASH1L are key mediators
  of both metabolic and epigenetic changes during cellular senescence.
