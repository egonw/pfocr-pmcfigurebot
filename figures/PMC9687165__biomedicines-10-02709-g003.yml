caption: Signaling pathway involved in macrophage self-renewal. In response to CSF-1
  and GM-CSF, SIRT1 regulates macrophage self-renewal through c-Myc and E2F-dependent
  pathways []. Soluble CSF-1R ligands (CSF1 and IL-34) trigger the Ras/MEK1/2/ERK1/2
  pathway, which, in turn, activates Ets transcription factors increasing the expression
  of cyclin-D and c-Myc [,]. In addition, by recruiting Src family kinases (SFK),
  CSF-1R also induces the MEK5/ERK5 pathway leading to macrophage proliferation [].
  Indeed, MEK5/ERK5 activation support TAMs proliferation by suppressing p21 expression
  []. IL-4 can induce macrophage proliferation through STAT6-mediated transcription
  [] and activates PI3K/AKT signaling, which is important for its pro-proliferative
  activity []. In response to GM-CSF, the JAK2/STAT5 pathway is triggered inducing
  macrophage proliferation [,]. Moreover, IL-4 and GM-CSF activate Ets, c-Myc, and
  KLF4 by inhibiting c-Maf and MafB expression downstream of the Bhlhe40/41 transcription
  factors [,] and work together with the ADO/A2A pathway to induce macrophage self-renewal
  via PI3K/Akt and MEK1/2/ERK1/2 signaling []. The molecular mechanisms of other signaling
  pathways, such as TREM2/DAP12, in macrophage proliferation remain to be documented.
  PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; A2A, ADORA2A adenosine receptor.
