caption: Mast cell degranulation measured by release of β-hexosaminidase after pre-treatment
  with metabolic pathway inhibitors. BMMCs were pre-treated with A) HEPES as vehicle
  control; B) oligomycin (OM) to inhibit respiration; or C) 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG)
  to inhibit glycolysis for 15 m before 1 h exposure to allergen, AgNP, or cmd 48/80.
  Two-way ANOVA (n=3–6). *signifies statistically significant (p<0.05) difference
  from control. †signifies statistically significant (p<0.05) difference from corresponding
  no pre-treatment group. Each n consists of a flask pooled together from two individual
  mice.
