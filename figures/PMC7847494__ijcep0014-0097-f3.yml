caption: GSEA enrichment analysis of PDK2-4 in breast cancer. A. Gene sets related
  to apoptosis, T cell receptor signaling pathway, P53 signaling pathway, natural
  killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, ERBB signaling pathway, B cell receptor signaling
  pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, JAK-Stat signaling pathway, and Wnt
  signaling pathway were up-regulated in the PDK2 high group. B. Gene sets related
  to B cell receptor signaling pathway, cell cycle, colorectal cancer, ERBB signaling
  pathway, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, non-small cell lung cancer,
  pancreatic cancer, pathway in cancer, renal cell carcinoma, T cell receptor signaling
  pathway, and Toll like receptor signaling pathway were up-regulated in the PDK3
  high group. C. Gene sets related to ERBB signaling pathway, JAK-Stat signaling pathway,
  MAPK signaling pathway, and MTOR signaling pathway were up-regulated in PDK4 high
  group; while gene sets related to DNA replication, cell cycle, and bladder cancer
  were up-regulated in the PDK4 low group.
