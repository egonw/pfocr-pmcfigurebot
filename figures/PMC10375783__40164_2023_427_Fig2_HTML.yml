caption: Role of ferroptosis in radiotherapy. Ionizing radiation can cause ferroptosis
  in several ways. DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation activates ATM and inhibits
  SLC7A11. DNA damage also activates the cGAS-STING signaling pathway and induces
  autophagy. Ionizing radiation induces ACSL4 expression and promotes the formation
  of lipid peroxidation substrates PUFA-PLs. Ionizing radiation causes ER stress,
  promotes p53 expression through PERK, and transcriptionally inhibits SLC7A11. Ionizing
  radiation also induces lipid peroxidation in adjacent cells through bystander effects
  by releasing RT-MPs and exosomes into the tumor microenvironment. ATM ataxia telangiectasia
  mutated protein, cGAS cyclic GMPâ€“AMP synthase, STING stimulator of interferon genes
  protein, PERK PKR-like ER kinase, RT-MPs irradiated tumor cell-released microparticles
