caption: 'Drug resistance to PCARBTP in cultured Pan02 cells. (A) Proteomic analysis
  of protein changes in PCARBTP resistant clones. Heatmap of unbiased clustering of
  only the significant proteins, 135 proteins with ANOVA p < 0.05 (color in Log2-scale),
  n = 3. (B) STRING analysis showing the following enriched KEGG pathway-linked proteins.
  Number of nodes: 45; number of edges: 89; average node degree: 3.96; avg. local
  clustering coefficient: 0.521; expected number of edges: 23; PPI enrichment p-value
  < 1.0 × 10−16. KEGG pathways: light green: Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis (hsa00010)
  (p value 3.45 × 10−8); yellow: metabolic pathways (hsa01100) (p value 4.26 × 10−7);
  light blue: carbon metabolism (hsa01200) (p value 1.08 × 10−5); dark green biosynthesis
  of amino acids (hsa01230) (p value 2.10 × 10−5); magenta: HIF-1 signaling pathway
  (hsa04066) (p value 7.12 × 10−5); red: metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450
  (hsa00980) (p value 0.00039); dark blue: glutathione metabolism (hsa00480) (p value
  0.0029). (C) Volcano plot analysis for significant up/down regulated proteins (PCARBTP/Pan02_control),
  ALDH3A1 in red circle is the most upregulated protein. (D) Western blot showed ALDH3A1
  was knocked down by ALDH3A1 lentiviral shRNA. (E,F) MTT assay performed on Pan02
  cells transfected with control shRNA and ALDH3A1 shRNA then treated with PCARBTP/PAPTP
  or combined with 0.25 µM of Gemcitabine and 20 nM of Abraxane as indicated (n =
  3, mean ± SD), * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.0005, **** p < 0.0001.'
