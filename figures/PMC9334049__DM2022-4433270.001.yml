caption: Differential mRNA profiles of CRC ONT sequencing reveal the most dysregulated
  immune-related pathways and genes. (a) Heatmap clusters of the mRNA levels of 4,179
  genes in 20 samples. (b) GSEA enriches the pathways for differentially expressed
  genes between cancer and normal tissues. (c) KEGG analysis investigates the pathway
  for these differential genes involved. (d). Gene Ontology (GO) identifies the biological
  process (BP), cellular component (CC), and molecular function (MF) for differentially
  expressed genes. (e) The top eight BP terms are plotted, and the genes enriched
  in these terms are shown with fold changes.
