caption: TSG-6 expression in ASCs and macrophages treated with TNF-α, IL-1β, and/or
  IFN-γ + LPS. ASCs or macrophages were treated with different concentration of TNF-α,
  IL-1β, and/or IFN-γ (20 ng/mL) + LPS (10pg/mL) for 48 h, and TSG-6 expression was
  detected in the cell lysate and culture supernatant using immunoblotting. (A) TSG-6
  expression in ASCs. (B) TSG-6 expression in macrophages. The data shown represent
  one of three independent experiments. * p ≤ 0.05 and ** p ≤ 0.01. S.E., short exposure
  (22 s); L.E. long exposure (300 s); Sup., supernatant.

  Signaling Pathway.
