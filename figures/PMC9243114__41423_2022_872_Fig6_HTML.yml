caption: Hypercholesterolemia is associated with NKT cell reduction and dysfunction
  in people with NAFLD and NAFLD-HCC. A UMAP plot of CD3+ single-cell transcriptomes
  from human healthy and NAFLD/NASH livers. NKT-like cells were colored by blue. B
  UMAP plots showing the expressions and distributions of CD3E, CD4, CD8A, and certain
  NKT cell markers. C KEGG pathway analysis showing the top 6 enriched categories
  of downregulated genes in NKT cells from NAFLD/NASH livers (Adjusted p < 0.05, Log2FC > 0.15,
  n = 455). D H&E, CD3 and CD56 co-immunofluorescence in healthy livers (n = 8), NAFLD
  livers (n = 26) and NAFLD-HCC- tumor-adjacent liver tissues (n = 30) were shown.
  Co-localization of CD3 positive and CD56 positive cells were shown in the merged
  images. Hoechst served as positive control for cell nuclei staining. Scale bar =
  100 μm. Correlations between CD3/CD56 scores (E) toward blood total cholesterol
  (F) or LDL levels (G) were shown. Data are mean ± SD. ****p < 0.0001. (E, one-way
  ANOVA; F, G, Spearman’s correlation coefficient)
