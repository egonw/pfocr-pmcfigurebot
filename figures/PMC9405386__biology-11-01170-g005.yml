caption: 'Identification of differentially expressed genes by RNA sequencing: (a)
  diagram showing the numbers of genes that shared the same patterns of transcriptional
  change. Genes with log2 fold change ≥ 1 and P ≤ 1 for the comparison between control
  and treated groups were determined using the DESeq2 package in R (version 3.3.2)
  and Cuffdiff v.2.2.156; (b) KEGG classification of differentially expressed genes;
  (c) induced genes involved in ethylene signaling pathway.'
