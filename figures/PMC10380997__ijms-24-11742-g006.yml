caption: 'Time-dependent effects of KY19382 in wound healing and stem cell markers.
  Wounded tissues excised from 1, 4, 7, and 10 d post wounding of  were subjected
  to IHC analyses. (A) Representative images for IHC analyses of β-catenin at wounds
  1, 4, 7, and 10 d post wounding (upper), and quantitative measurements of intensities
  of β-catenin (lower) (n = 3 independent experiments). (B) Representative images
  for IHC analyses of Collagen I at wounds 1, 4, 7, and 10 d post wounding (upper),
  and quantitative measurements of intensities of Collagen I (lower) (n = 3 independent
  experiments). (C) Representative images for IHC analyses of PCNA at wounds 1, 4,
  7, and 10 d post wounding (upper), and quantitative measurements of intensities
  of PCNA (lower) (n = 3 independent experiments). (D) Representative images for IHC
  analyses of Keratin 14 at wounds 1, 4, 7, and 10 d post wounding (upper), and quantitative
  measurements of intensities of Keratin 14 (lower) (n = 3 independent experiments).
  (E) Representative images for IHC analyses of CD34 at wounds 1, 4, 7, and 10 d post
  wounding (upper), and quantitative measurements of intensities of CD34 (lower) (n
  = 3 independent experiments). (F) Representative images for IHC analyses of Nestin
  at wounds 1, 4, 7, and 10 d post wounding (upper), and quantitative measurements
  of intensities of Nestin (lower) (n = 3 independent experiments). Dashed lines demarcate
  the epidermal–dermal boundary. Original magnification: (A–D), ×200; (E,F), ×400.
  Values are expressed as means ± SEM. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.005; ***, p < 0.0005,
  significantly different from vehicle, control, or as indicated.'
