caption: A distinct endothelial cell subpopulation is present in VaD. (A–C) Transcriptomically
  unique subpopulations of endothelial cells were present in VaD samples. (A) UMAP
  plots showing the distribution of endothelial subpopulations (e1–e3) in VaD, VaDadj
  and NC PVWM samples. (B) Distribution of VaD‐associated endothelial subpopulations.
  (C) Expression levels of the top enriched genes in the three subpopulations at the
  single‐cell level (adjusted p < 0.001, log2 fold change >0.25). (D–F) GO pathway
  analysis (g:Profiler) of the transcriptome signature of the three endothelial cell
  subclusters (e1–e3). See also Tables  and
article_title: Single‐nucleus transcriptome analysis reveals disease‐ and regeneration‐associated
  endothelial cells in white matter vascular dementia.
