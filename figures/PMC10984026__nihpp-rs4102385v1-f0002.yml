figure_title: Transcriptomic analysis of H460 parental and CD109 deficient cells
caption: A) Heatmap showing the top 20 up- and down-regulated genes in the CD109 deficient
  cells based on the average log2 fold change of H2E vs. H460 and H1J vs. H460. The
  heatmap color code represents row z-scores based on transformed expression counts.
  B) Enrichment analysis of genes differentially expressed in both CD109 deficient
  clones as compared to H460 parental cells was performed with Gene Ontology (GO)
  cellular component terms. All significantly enriched GO terms are shown. C) Enrichment
  analysis performed with Hallmark pathway gene sets from MSigDb. All significantly
  enriched pathways are shown. The p-value of the enrichment is indicated by color.
  The number of differentially expressed genes matching the GO terms and pathways
  is indicated by dot size.
