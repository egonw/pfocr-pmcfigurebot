caption: DHCE induced G2/M phase arrest of gastric cancer cells. (A) The distribution
  of MGC803 and SGC7901 cells at different phases after treatment with DHCE (0, 3,
  6, or 12 μM) for 24 h. The experiment was performed in triplicate, and the statistical
  results are expressed as the means ± SD (* p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 compared with
  the control group). (B) The expression levels of cyclin B1 were detected by Western
  blot in MGC803 and SGC7901 cells which were treated with DHCE (0, 3, 6, or 12 μM)
  for 24 h. The experiment was performed in triplicate, and the statistical results
  are expressed as the means ± SD (* p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 compared with the control
  group).
