caption: mt-dsRNA downregulation attenuated the cellular response to poly(I:C) stimulation(A)
  Heatmap of DEG analysis for I-IFN signaling pathway genes. The two columns represent
  log2 fold changes with or without 2-CM pretreatment 24 h prior to poly(I:C) stimulation.
  (B and C) Western blot analysis of PKR phosphorylation (B) and cell viability measured
  by APH assay (C) upon downregulation of mtRNAs before poly(I:C) transfection. (D
  and E) Representative fluorescence images of AQP5 (D) and TJC proteins ZO-1 and
  occludin (E) upon poly(I:C) stimulation with or without 2-CM pretreatment. The fluorescence
  intensities were quantified as the mean of three independent experiments and normalized
  to the mock-transfection control group. The scale bar represents 100 μm. The numbers
  of images used for quantification were n = 7 for AQP5 in DMSO-control, n = 5 for
  AQP5 in the 2-CM-treated group, and n = 3 for ZO-1 and occludin. The error bars
  denote SEM. All statistical significances were calculated using one-tailed Student’s
  t tests, ∗p ≤ 0.05, ∗∗p ≤ 0.01, and ∗∗∗p ≤ 0.001.
