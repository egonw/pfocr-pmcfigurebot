caption: 'miR-214b-3p alleviated LPS-induced inflammation and apoptosis in HD11 cells:
  (A,B) The expression levels of miR-214b-3p were reduced in coccidia-infected samples
  and the LPS-induced HD11 inflammatory model, as detected by qRT-PCR. (C,D) The expression
  levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ in LPS-stimulated HD11 cells with miR-214b-3p mimics
  and inhibitors, as detected by qRT-PCR and ELISA. (E,F) Cell apoptosis was detected
  with Annexin V–FITC/PI double-staining via flow cytometry assay. (G) The mRNA levels
  of STAT3 in HD11 cells with miR-214b-3p mimics and inhibitors. Data are presented
  as means ± SD (n = 3 biologically independent samples). * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01;
  *** p < 0.001 (Student’s t-test).'
