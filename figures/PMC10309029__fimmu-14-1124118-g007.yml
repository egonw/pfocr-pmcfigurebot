caption: Gut dysbiosis in the pathogenesis of KD. The diversity of gut microbiota
  in the KD mouse model were reduced, especially the SCFAs-producing probiotics. The
  leaky gut was associated with the decrease of tight junction proteins in gut dysbiosis.
  The altered gut microbiota could influence on the production and transportation
  of SCFAs to regulate inflammatory responses. The potential therapeutic effect of
  butyrate may work on promoting the MKP-1 expression to inhibit MAPK pathway so as
  to reduce the inflammation.

  activation in Kawasaki disease.
