caption: Significant gene ontology enrichment terms and enriched pathways of the candidate
  hub genes. (A) Top 20 GO terms. (B) Top 20 enriched KEGG pathways. GO and pathway
  analysis was acquired from the Metascape tool. p < 0.01. Dark colors represent a
  significant enrichment of more genes compared to lighter ones.
