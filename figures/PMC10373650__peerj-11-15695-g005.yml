figure_title: Functional analysis of common signaling genes in different cancer datasets
caption: '(A) Common signaling genes among ESCA, LUAD, COAD, and KIRC. (B) There is
  a considerable overlap of the same signaling genes and their biological functions
  among the four cancers. The outer ring represents different cancer-signaling genomes,
  and the inner ring represents identical genes and functions. The interconnections
  of identical genes are indicated by purple lines and functional links by blue lines.
  KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of signaling genes in four cancers: ESCA (C), COAD
  (D), KIRC (E), and LUAD (F). (G) Common signaling genes are involved in multiple
  cancer-related pathways. (H) Detailed common signaling genes in cancer-related pathways.'
