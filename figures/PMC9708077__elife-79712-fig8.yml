figure_title: Rosa26-GAP reprogramming from day 8 to day 15 induces ectopic GLAST
  + supporting cells and upregulates some hair cell genes in endogenous supporting
  cells
caption: '(A) Control and reprogrammed cochleae immunostained for markers specific
  to inner phalangeal and border cells (GLAST), a general supporting cell marker (SOX2),
  and a hair cell marker, Myosin VIIA. A reprogrammed GLAST positive supporting cell
  in Rosa26-GAP condition is indicated with arrows. Images show a 16 µm section of
  the organ of Corti (control and reprogrammed). Scale bar: 50 µm. (B) Single-cell
  RNA seq analysis of supporting cells under reprogramming conditions (induction at
  day 8, analysis at day 15). Volcano plots show that several hair cell-specific genes
  and Notch pathway genes are upregulated by reprogramming factors, while several
  supporting cell genes are downregulated. Figure 8—source data 1.List of genes downregulated
  in supporting cells in response to transcription factor reprogramming at P15.  Figure
  8—source data 2.List of genes upregulated in supporting cells in response to transcription
  factor reprogramming at P15.'
