figure_title: An established map of metabolic pathways
caption: Map of metabolic pathways highlighting 204 of the 632 annotated metabolites
  analyzed in this study (dark gray and red circles), including 154 with genetic associations
  (red circles). We also mapped 51 metabolites to class nodes (indicated by star symbols).
  Of the 46 class nodes, 22 are red, indicating that they contain at least one metabolite
  with a genetic association. Genes (grey and lime green squares) and causal genes
  regulating associations discovered in the study (lime green squares; as explained
  in the section ‘’) are illustrated. Downward-pointing arrowheads indicate a process
  and upward-pointing triangles indicate a source. The inset focuses on the tryptophan
  metabolism pathway. An interactive version is available on the accompanying webserver
  at https://omicscience.org/apps/mgwas.
