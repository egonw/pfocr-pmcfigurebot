figure_title: Glycolytic flux decreased in EC exposed to steady laminar flow as compared
  to static culture and oscillating disturbed flow. Inhibiting glycolysis via 2-DG
  in EC exposed to oscillating disturbed flow decreased eNOS O-GlcNAcylation and subsequently
  increased eNOS phosphorylation and NO
caption: (A) % labeled intracellular glycolytic intermediates (glucose, fructose-6-phosphate,
  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, and lactate) measured by mass spectrometry in HUVEC
  exposed to 24 hours static culture (‘S’), steady laminar (‘L’), or oscillating disturbed
  flow (‘D’) followed by 13C-glucose for 2 minutes. A simplified glycolysis pathway
  is depicted showing glucose metabolized to pyruvate, which is then converted to
  lactate. The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) branches off glycolysis at fructose-6-phosphate.
  n = 9 samples, normalized to static culture and βactin or eNOS. p = 8.75×10−4 (glucose),
  p = 6.19×10−3 (fructose-6-phosphate), and p = 1.06×10−2 (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate)
  by Kruskal-Wallis test, with p values on the figure determined by Dunn’s multiple
  comparisons test. (B) Western blot and quantification of eNOS O-GlcNAcylation and
  p-eNOS in HUVECs exposed to 24 hours oscillating disturbed flow +/− 1 μM 2-DG. n
  = 9 samples. Statistical significance determined by Mann-Whitney test. (C) NO levels,
  measured via Griess Assay, in HUVEC exposed to 24 hours oscillating disturbed flow
  +/− 1 μM 2-DG. n = 3 samples per experiment. 1 representative experiment shown of
  3 total experiments. (D) DAF-FM diacetate fluorescent images (green) and quantification
  of intracellular NO in HUVEC exposed to 24 hours oscillating disturbed flow +/−
  1 μM 2-DG. Scale bar = 20 μm. n = 7 samples. 1 representative experiment shown of
  2 total experiments. Statistical significance determined by Mann-Whitney test. E)
  Zysense NO analyzer quantification of NO in the conditioned media from HUVEC exposed
  to 24 hours oscillating disturbed flow +/− 1 μM 2-DG. n = 6 samples 1 representative
  experiment shown of 2 total experiments. Statistical significance determined by
  Mann-Whitney test.
