caption: SS inhibited the proliferation of CRC cells. (A) Cell viability of SW620,
  SW480, A549 and MGC803 cells after SS treatment. The cells were treated with different
  concentrations of SS and equal amounts of DMSO for 24 h. Cell viability was detected
  using CCK8. (B) EdU staining results showed that SS significantly inhibited the
  proliferation of SW620 cells. Drugs were added as per SS (40 μM) and 5-FU groups
  (0.7 mM), incubated for 48 h and assayed using the EdU kit. (C) Images of colony
  formation showed that SS treatment significantly reduced the number of colonies.
  Plate clone formation experiments were performed by adding the drug in the blank
  group, SS group (40 μM), and 5-FU group (0.7 mM). All experiments were performed
  three times independently. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.
