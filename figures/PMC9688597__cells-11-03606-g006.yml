caption: Overexpression of LTB4R promoted the migration, invasion and EMT process
  of ccRCC cells. (Aâ€“D) Overexpression of LTB4R promoted the migratory ability of
  Caki1 and ACHN cells. (E,F) Overexpression of LTB4R promoted the clonogenicity of
  Caki1 and ACHN cells. (G) Western blot Analysis showed that overexpression of LTB4R
  significantly decreased the epithelial phenotype E-cadherin and increased mesenchymal
  phenotype (N-cadherin, Vimentin) of Caki1 and ACHN cells. A 2-tailed t test was
  used (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01).
