caption: In situ identification of activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  1/2 (ERK 1/2) in Taenia solium cysts. Immunofluorescence performed on a racemose
  cyst, vesicular cysts, and racemose cyst treatment with metformine (Met). Nuclei
  were stained with DAPI (A, D, G). Cells positive for phospho ERK1/2 (B, E, H) were
  observed only in racemose larvae (red arrows). Merge (C, F, I). Representative images.
  The graph (J) depicts the ratio of phospho ERK1/2 to nuclei fluorescence intensity
  in racemose cyts, untreated and treated with Met (4 mM), relative to vesicular cysts.
  Values are expressed as means Â± S.D. One-way ANOVA test (*P<0.05; ***P<0.001).
article_title: Proliferative cells in racemose neurocysticercosis have an active MAPK
  signalling pathway and respond to metformin treatment.
