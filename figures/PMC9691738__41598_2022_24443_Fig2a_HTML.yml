  show a biological process, molecular functions, cellular component and pathway involvement
  of the genes. (B) mRNA expression of SPP1, VEGFA, FOXO1, RUNX2, CD44 and POSTN genes
  in lung cancer tissues and adjacent normal lung tissues. (C) Relationship between
  mRNA expression of hub genes and individual cancer stages of lung cancer patients.
