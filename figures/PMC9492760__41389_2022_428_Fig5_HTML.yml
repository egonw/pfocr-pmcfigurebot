figure_title: Silencing HPSE suppresses cell proliferation of BRAF V600E-mutant CRC
  cells through AKT/p27Kip1 pathway
caption: A Expression levels of cell proliferation-related signaling proteins in BRAF
  V600E-mutant CRC cells with or without HPSE silencing. Red color represents upregulated
  proteins. Green represents downregulated proteins. The same trend was observed in
  three independent repeated experiments. Representative images and semi-quantification
  analysis are shown. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. B IHC staining
  of p27Kip1 and phospho-AKTser473 in subcutaneous tumor tissues. Representative images
  and semi-quantification analysis are shown. Data are presented as the mean ± standard
  deviation. C–E Representative images and statistical analysis of colony formation
  assay. Cells were seeded in six-well plates at 1000 cells per well and cultured
  for 10 days. In the group treated with SC79, SC79 (S7863, Selleckchem, Shanghai,
  China) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma) and diluted to 10 µM with
  the complete medium before use. Cells were incubated with DMSO/SC79 (10 µM) for
  7 days. The same trend was observed in three independent repeated experiments. Data
  are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. F Proposed model for the mechanism
  of HPSE function on cell proliferation in BRAF V600E-mutant CRC cells. Red color
  represents upregulated or activated proteins. Green represents downregulated or
  inactivated proteins. The student’s t-test was used to determine the P-value in
  two-group comparisons. One-way ANOVA analysis and Tukey’s test were used for multiple
  comparisons. ****P < 0.0001, ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05, ns P > 0.05.
