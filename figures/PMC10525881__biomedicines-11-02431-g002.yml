caption: RS’s inhibition of TGFβ-induced signaling was not responsible for its effect
  on agonist-induced permeability. (A) Cells were pretreated with RS vehicle (DMSO)
  or 10 µM RS for 30 min before adding TGFβ vehicle (0.1% BSA in water) or 50 ng/mL
  TGFβ for an additional 30 min, after which time the cells were lysed and subjected
  to Western blot analysis with the indicated antibodies. Band intensities were quantified
  using ImageJ. The pSMAD3/Rasgap ratio for the blot shown is presented in the bar
  graph. Similar results (efficient RS-mediated suppression of the TGFβ pathway) were
  observed on at least three independent occasions. (B) Same as A, except the cells
  were transfected with either siScramble or siSMAD4. The TEER tracing is of a single,
  representative experiment; the bar graph is the compilation of at least three independent
  experiments. (C) The cells used in panel (B) were subjected to Western blot analysis
  using the indicated antibodies. The blot is of a single, representative experiment,
  while the bar graph shows the fold change in the intensity of SMAD4 in three independent
  experiments. * p < 0.05; n.s. p > 0.05.
