caption: Lipid accumulation amplifies Treg suppression function. CD36 is up-regulated
  in both Teffs and Tregs, and the uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL)
  by CD36 leads to lipid peroxidation-mediated mitochondrial destruction, which interferes
  with metabolism and promotes cell senescence. Tregs effectively prevent lipid peroxidation
  by upregulating GPX4 and ensuring a high level of lipid metabolism. Apoptotic tumor
  cells promote mevalonate pathway-dependent cholesterol synthesis and CTLA-4 expression
  in Tregs by activating the PD1-PTEN signaling pathway. IDO receptor activation potentiates
  PD1-mediated PTEN activation. Lipids and SCFAs in TME promote the expression of
  Foxp3. Foxp3 promotes the expression of the PD1 gene by promoting the nuclear translocation
  of NFAT1. In addition, Foxp3 maintained the high level of cAMP and activated the
  mevalonate pathway through cAMP/PKA-SREBP1 to increase cholesterol level and CTLA-4
  expression
