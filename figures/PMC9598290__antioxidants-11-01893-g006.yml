caption: 'Effect of fraxetin on the regulation of adipogenesis through MAPK signaling.
  The protein expressions of the MAPK signaling pathway, including (A) p38, (B) Erk1/2,
  and (C) Jnk phosphorylation, were analyzed with Western blotting. Each phosphorylation
  level was normalized with each total protein level. All data were obtained in triplicate.
  The asterisk symbol represents significant differences between the MDI-treated group
  and others (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01). The crosshatch symbol represents meaningful
  differences among the nondifferentiated group and others (## p < 0.01, ### p < 0.001),
  as verified using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Dunnettâ€™s post
  hoc analysis.'
