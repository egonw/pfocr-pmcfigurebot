caption: 'hUCMSC-CM activated Wnt/catenin signaling pathway. (a) CTNNB1, CMYC, and
  CYCLIND1 gene expressions were measured by RT-PCR in EECs treated with serum-free
  DMEM/F12 (control group) or hUCMSC-CM. (b) Western blotting images and relative
  quantitative analysis of total β-catenin, c-myc, and cyclin D1 protein in EECs.
  EECs were treated with serum-free DMEM/F12 (control group) or hUCMSC-CM. (c) Immunofluorescence
  staining of β-catenin protein in EECs after serum-free DMEM/F12 (control group)
  or hUCMSC-CM treatments. Scale bar: 20 μm. (d) Western blotting determined the nuclear
  and cytoplasmic β-catenin levels in EEC cells after serum-free DMEM/F12 (control
  group) or hUCMSC-CM treatments. (e) The TCF/LEF luciferase signals in EECs after
  serum-free DMEM/F12 (control group) or hUCMSC-CM treatments. ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01.'
