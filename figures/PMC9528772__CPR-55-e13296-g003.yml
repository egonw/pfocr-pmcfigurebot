caption: Sirt6 deficiency promoted mitochondrial fission by mediating the phosphorylation
  of Drp1 at Ser637. (A–C) Western blot of Drp1 and Fis1 protein expression in cultured
  human podocytes in different groups. (D–F) Western blot of Mfn2 and OPA1 protein
  expression in cultured human podocytes in different groups. (G–I) Western blotting
  was performed to analyse Drp1 phosphorylation levels among different groups. (J)
  MitoTracker and pDrp1(S637) costaining in podocytes cultured under different conditions
  in different groups. Scale bar = 3 μm. *p < 0.05, n = 3
article_title: Sirt6 deficiency contributes to mitochondrial fission and oxidative
  damage in podocytes via ROCK1‐Drp1 signalling pathway.
