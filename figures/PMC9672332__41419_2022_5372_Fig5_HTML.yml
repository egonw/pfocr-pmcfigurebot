figure_title: Ferroptosis signaling pathway was activated in tulp1-dKO zebrafish
caption: 'A KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the genes identified to be differentially
  expressed between wt and tulp1-dKO groups. The significantly enriched pathways are
  shown. B GSEA of ferroptosis-related genes. C–H Relative expression of genes involved
  in ferroptosis was detected by qRT-PCR at 4 dpf. Mean ± SD. *P < 0.05. **P < 0.01.
  Lipid droplets performed by Nile Red (I) or BODIPY (J) in wt and tulp1-dKO zebrafish
  at 4 dpf. Enlarged images of the boxed areas are shown in the lower right corner.
  Scale bar: 20 µm. K Perls/DAB staining in wt and tulp1-dKO zebrafish at 4 dpf. Enlarged
  images of the boxed areas are shown beneath. Scale bar: 25 µm. L TEM images of mitochondria
  from wt and tulp1-dKO zebrafish. M, mitochondria. OS, outer segment. Scale bar:
  0.2 µm.'
