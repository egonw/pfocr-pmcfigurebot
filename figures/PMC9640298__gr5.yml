caption: RNA sequencing of acutely FACS-isolated ADSCs identified PI3K-Akt signaling
  as the key regulator in rGO-induced ADSC reprogramming. (A) Schematic illustration
  of isolating and purifying GFP-expressing ADSCs from regenerated nerve bridge via
  FACS. (B) Representative FACS plots of ADSC purification based on GFP expression
  level. Control ADSCs without GFP expression were used for gating. (C) Differentially
  expressed genes from PI3K and FA signaling were listed as heatmaps. (D) Visualization
  of KEGG pathway enrichment analysis for the up-regulated genes between the rGO/PCL
  and PCL groups. The size of dots indicates the relative number of up-regulated DEGs.
  (E) MBP and NGF expression of ADSCs on rGO/PCL scaffolds dramatically decreased
  in response to LY294002 treatment. (F) RNA-sequencing differential gene expression
  analysis of ADSCs from rGO/PCL and PCL conduits. Genes regulated over 2-fold changes
  (adj. p < 0.05) were highlighted in red and green. (G) Quantitative analysis of
  MBP, NGF and p-Akt showed the expression of these proteins decreased about 2.425,
  3.885, and 2.436 folds respectively, after treatment of LY294002, as measured by
  Western blot. **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
