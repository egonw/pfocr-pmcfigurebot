caption: 'IRIN plus radiation therapy strongly damaged DNA and activated the cGAS/STING
  pathway (A) Representative confocal laser scanning microscopic images of nuclear
  γ-H2AX foci in HT29 cells with different treatments. Green: γ-H2AX. Blue: DAPI.
  White arrow: micronuclei. Bar: 10 μm. (B) Quantitation of the number of γ-H2AX foci
  in (A). Data were presented as the mean ± SD obtained from three independent experiments.
  (C) Representative confocal laser scanning microscopic images of dsDNA in HT29 cells
  with different treatments. Green: dsDNA. Blue: DAPI. Bar: 10 μm. (D) Quantitation
  of fluorescent intensity of dsDNA in (C). Data were presented as the mean ± SD obtained
  from three independent experiments. (E–F) qRT-PCR analysis of cGAS (E) and STING
  (F) expression levels in HCT8 cells with different treatments. Data were presented
  as the mean ± SD obtained from three independent experiments. (G) Western blot analysis
  and quantitation of cGAS/STING pathway-related proteins in HCT8 cells with different
  treatments. ImageJ software was used for densitometric analysis. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001 (One-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey''s test). (For interpretation
  of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
  Web version of this article.)'
