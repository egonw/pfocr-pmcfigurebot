caption: 'A genetic screen for components of the GPI biosynthetic pathway identified
  CLPTM1L. (A) Schematic of the GPI biosynthetic pathway in the ER. The GlcN-PI scrambling
  step is indicated in red and DPM scrambling is indicated in gray. Genes essential
  for GPI biosynthesis and GPI anchoring to protein are listed. (B) Schematic of the
  restoration of GPI biosynthesis in PIGA-KO cells in the presence of chemically synthesized
  GlcNAc-PI or GlcN-PI. (C) Scheme depicting a FACS-based genome-wide CRISPR screen
  for genes involved in efficient GlcNAc-PI utilization for GPI biosynthesis using
  PIGA-KO HEK293 cells. (D) Loss of an ability to restore GPI-AP using exogenous GlcNAc-PI
  by PIGA-KO cells after the FACS-based genome-wide CRISPR screen. Starting clone,
  cells after mutagenesis, sort1 cells, and sort2 cells incubated with DMSO or 2 µM
  GlcNAc-PI overnight were stained with anti-CD59 mAb and analyzed by flow cytometry.
  NS, cells not stained with first antibody. Representative of two biological repeats.
  (E) Gene scores in unsorted versus sorted PIGA-KO cells. Known GPI biosynthetic
  pathway genes are shown in green with some of their names, CD59 is shown in blue,
  and CLPTM1L is shown in purple. See also Datasets S2 and S3. (F and H) Restoration
  of CD59 expression in PIGA-KO and CLPTM1L-PIGA-DKO cells in the presence of various
  concentrations of GlcNAc-PI (F) or GlcN-PI (H) for 24 h. MFI: mean fluorescence
  intensity. (G and I) Time course of CD59 expression in PIGA-KO and CLPTM1L-PIGA-DKO
  cells preincubated with GlcNAc-PI (G) or GlcN-PI (I) for 2 h. Data are mean ± SEM
  in F–I of two independent biological repeats.'
