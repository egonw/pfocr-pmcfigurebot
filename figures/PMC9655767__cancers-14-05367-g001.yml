caption: SETD8 expression is elevated in endometrial cancer, and SETD8 knockdown suppresses
  cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in endometrial cancer cells. (A) SETD8
  mRNA expression was increased in endometrial cancer tissues as analyzed using qRT-PCR
  (p < 0.01). (B) Transfection of siSETD8 suppressed cell proliferation. (C) HEC50B
  and HEC1B cells transfected with siSETD8 for 48 h. siSETD8-transfected cells showed
  decreased H4K20me1 levels and increased cleaved PARP levels. (D) HEC50B and HEC1B
  transfected with siSETD8 for 96 h. SiSETD8-transfected cells showed prolonged sub-G1
  phase and cell cycle arrest. (E) TUNEL-positive cells were detected in siSETD8-transfected
  cells (HEC50B and HEC1B cells).
