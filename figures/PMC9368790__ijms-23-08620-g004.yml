caption: KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Pathway) analysis of DEGs.
  (A) GO map of DEGs in E1-10_vs_H32-10; (B) GO map of DEGs in E1-12_vs_H32-12; (C)
  GO map of DEGs in E2-10_vs_H32-10; (D) GO map of DEGs in E2-12_vs_H32-12. y-axis
  represents the pathname, and the x-axis represents the enrichment factor. The larger
  the enrichment factor, the higher the enrichment level of DGEs in the pathway. The
  p value is expressed by color with white as the border. The deeper the red color,
  the more important the accumulation of DEGs in the signaling pathway. The number
  of DEGs in a pathway was expressed by the size of the circle. The larger the circle,
  the higher the enrichment of the pathway.
