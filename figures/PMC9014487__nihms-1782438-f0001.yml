figure_title: Melanoma metastases show decreased glycolysis and elevated levels of
  TCA cycle intermediates fumarate and malate
caption: A) Pathway enrichment analysis was performed with the set of genes whose
  expression level was significantly up or down in FACS-sorted melanoma cells isolated
  from metastatic nodules as compared to subcutaneous tumors. Gene sets from three
  patient melanomas, M481, M405, and UT10 were combined for the analysis. B-C) Heat
  map representation of the RNA-sequencing data demonstrating fold change in expression
  of glycolytic (B) and TCA (C) enzymes. All samples were normalized to the average
  FPKM of their respective PDX group. Green indicates fold changes that are lower
  than the average FPKM within individual melanomas and red indicates higher than
  average FPKM fold changes. D-E) Relative abundance of the metabolites from glycolysis
  (D) or the TCA (E) cycle in primary subcutaneous tumors and spontaneous metastatic
  nodules dissected from multiple organs in mice xenografted with melanoma M481 (n=8
  mice). F-G) Isotope tracing in primary subcutaneous tumors and metastatic nodules
  from mice xenografted with M481 after infusion with [1,2-13C]-glucose. The enrichment
  of metabolites generated through glycolysis (F) or the TCA cycle (G) is shown as
  the enrichment of the m+2 fraction normalized to fractional enrichment of m+2 glucose
  in the host mouse at the end of the infusion experiment (t=3 hours). (n=8 mice).
  Metabolites were detected and measured with a ThermoScientific QExactive HF-X hybrid
  quadrupole orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometer (HRMS) coupled to a Vanquish
  UHPLC as described in the  section. For each metabolite in (D-G), data shown is
  the mean +/− SEM. Unpaired t-tests were performed between the two groups with *
  p≤0.05, ** p≤0.01, *** p≤0.001, **** p≤0.001.
