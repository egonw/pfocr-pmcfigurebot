figure_title: Metabolic functional prediction associated to quantitative profiles
  of (A) prevalent health-associated bacteria OTUs and (B) linear discriminant analysis
  (LDA) combined effect size (LEfSe) as bacterial species and associated microbial
  metabolic function biomarkers for healthy or fat-metabolic disorder (denoted “unhealthy”)
  groups
caption: 'Microbial metabolic functions were estimated according to KEGG pathways.
  In (A), a different color from nude to tangerine represents the level of quantitative
  microbial metabolic function abundance from absence to the highest presence level
  (scale in vertical bar chart). In (B), a numeric in front of KEGG name represents
  the KEGG pathway category: 1, metabolism; 2, organismal systems; 3, diseases; 4,
  environmental information processing; 5, genetic information processing; and 6,
  cellular processes. The LDA score >3.0 was referred microbial metabolic function
  markers (ANOVA Welch’s test, P < 0.05).'
