caption: A) and C) Time evolution of the probability density functions for a low-frequency
  feeding regime continuous culture (A) S. cerevisiae and B) S. cerevisiae in co-culture
  with E. coli. Time is color-coded from blue at 24h to red at 80h. B) and D) Time
  evolution of the mean (green line) and standard deviation (grey bars) for the S.
  cerevisiae and S. cerevisiae in co-culture with E. coli, respectively. C) and E)
  Time evolution of the relative enzyme (Î¨rel) corresponding to each metabolic pathway
  for the S. cerevisiae and S. cerevisiae in co-culture with E. coli, respectively.
article_title: Controlling microbial co-culture based on substrate pulsing can lead
  to stability through differential fitness advantages.
