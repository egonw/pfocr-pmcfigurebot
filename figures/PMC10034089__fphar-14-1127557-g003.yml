caption: CXCLs expression-based subtypes of OC patients. (A,B) Consensus clustering
  analysis was performed based on the expression of CXCLs. The consensus cumulative
  distribution function (CDF) from k = 2 to 9 is shown in (A), and the heatmap of
  the consensus matrix (k = 3) is shown in (B). (C) PCA plots of the three CXCL subtypes.
  Blue dots represent CXCL cluster A, yellow dots represent CXCL cluster B, and red
  dots represent CXCL cluster C. (D) The mRNA expression of 16 CXCLs in the three
  subtypes is shown in a heatmap. (E) A heatmap shows the results of KEGG pathway
  enrichment analysis between CXCL clusters B and C. (F) The Kaplan-Meier curve displays
  the outcome of patients in the three CXCL subtypes. (G) Box plots display the level
  of immune cell infiltration in the three CXCL subtypes. ***p < 0.001.
