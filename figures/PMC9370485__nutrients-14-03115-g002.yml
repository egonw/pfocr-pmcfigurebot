caption: Polyphenols and their roles in renal mitochondrial dysfunction. Polyphenols
  regulate mitochondria biogenesis and dynamics via increasing Nrf2 and PGC-1α expression
  and balancing fission and fusion events, while kidney diseases result from imbalanced
  mitochondria dynamics and reduce biogenesis. In this pathway, deacetylation of SIRT
  and phosphorylation of AMPK can positively regulate biogenesis. Polyphenols can
  decrease the protein levels of pro-inflammatory factors, including TNF-α, IL-1β,
  IL-6, and NF-κB to exert anti-inflammatory effects. They also improve mitochondria
  function and injury through inhibition of ROS generation. Polyphenols show protective
  effects through inhibiting MPT pore opening, which can trigger the release of cytochrome
  C into the cytosol, swelling of mitochondria, and activating of caspase cascade;
  finally, they reveal anti-apoptotic impacts. Further, polyphenols restore antioxidant
  enzyme levels such as SOD2 and CAT to normal levels, improve antioxidant status,
  and scavenge free radicals.
