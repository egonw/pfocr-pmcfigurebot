caption: 'The exosomal miR-221-3p derived from BMSCs alleviated asthma progression
  in mice. BALB/c mice were randomly divided into three groups (n = 8 per group):
  control group, OVA group, and OVA + Exo group. OVA-induced asthmatic mice model
  was constructed, and exosomal miR-221-3p was injected for treatment. (a) The expression
  of miR-221-3p in lung tissues of mice was measured by using RT-qPCR. (b), (c) The
  expression of FGF2 protein in lung tissues of mice was detected by using Western
  blot analysis. (d) The airway hyperresponsiveness of mice in all groups was detected.
  (e), (f) Histopathological evaluation of lung tissue sections from each group were
  detected by HE staining and Masson staining, and significant histopathological changes
  were marked with an arrow. (g) The number of total and differential inflammatory
  cells in BALF. (h) The serum OVA-specific IgE levels of mice in all groups were
  detected by using ELISA.(i) The levels of TGF-β1, IL-4, and IL-13 in BALF were examined
  by using ELISA. Data from at least three independent experiments were presented
  as mean ± SD ∗P < 0.05.'
