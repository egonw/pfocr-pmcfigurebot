caption: Crosstalk between CSCs and their niches. Cells present in the CSC niche produce
  some factors that stimulate self-renewal and angiogenesis and secrete factors involved
  in tumor cell invasion and metastasis. MSCs secrete CXCL12, IL-6, and IL-8 (the
  black arrows indicate the expression promotion) which promote CSC stemness via upregulating
  NF-κB. To attract more MSCs towards CSCs, the latter also secretes IL-6. Gremlin
  1 is an antagonist produced by MSCs to boost up the undifferentiated state. The
  tumor cells present around the CSC produce IL-4 which stimulates TH2 and further
  produce TNF-α for upregulating the NF-κB signaling. GM-CSF, G-CSF, and M-CSF are
  also produced by the same tumor cell to induce the expansion of some immune cells
  such as TAMs, TANs, MDSCs, and DCs. To enhance the plasticity of CSCs, TNF-α and
  TGF-β are produced by TAM to promote the NF-κB-dependent or TGF-β-dependent EMT.
  TGF-β is also being produced by TAMs to stimulate the Treg cells. TAM, Treg, and
  hypoxic microenvironment also inhibit CD8+ T cell, NK cell cytotoxicity, and phagocytosis
  of macrophages thus inhibiting immunosurveillance (red arrows depicting inhibition).
  Hypoxic microenvironment increases the concentration of ROS, promotes cell survival,
  and induces EMT via the TGF-β signaling pathway. The downregulated c-Myc expression
  inhibits cell proliferation under hypoxia and enhances stemness. CXCL12 is produced
  by CAF to promote angiogenesis. Under hypoxic microenvironment, CSCs and ECs produce
  VEGF, which further induces angiogenesis. Nitric oxide production via the Notch
  signaling pathways leads to the self-renewal of CSCs. CAFs also produce TNC, HGF,
  and MMP2/3/9, which help in the enhancement of the Wnt and Notch signaling. It also
  produces MMP10 which promotes ECM degradation and remodeling thus enhances the CSC's
  stemness.
