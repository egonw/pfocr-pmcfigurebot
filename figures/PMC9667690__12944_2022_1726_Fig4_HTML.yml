caption: Many genes were considered related to metabolism or metabolic processes based
  on transcriptomic sequencing and subsequent annotation. a. Heatmap visualization
  of differential expression between the WY-14,643 treatment group and the ctrl groups.
  b. KEGG annotations of the DEGs. The layer 1 pathways are marked in the top right-hand
  corner. c. GO annotations of the DEGs. The abscissas in a and b represent the number
  of genes annotated to a certain pathway
