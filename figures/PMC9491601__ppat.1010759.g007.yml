figure_title: Extracellular vesicles were internalized into the recipient cells via
  classical endocytic pathway
caption: (A, C, E) Goat PBMCs were pretreated with MβCD (A), CPZ (C), or wortmannin
  (E) for 1h at 37°C and then incubated with PKH26 labeled-EVs-PPRV for 6h. After
  removal of surface-bound EVs and ligands, internalized EVs were analyzed by using
  a confocal laser scanning microscope. The nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342.
  PKH26-labeled PBS were used as PKH26-only negative control. (B, D, F) Goat PBMCs
  were pretreated with MβCD (B), CPZ (D), or wortmannin (F) for 1h at 37°C and then
  incubated with PKH26 labeled-EVs-PPRV for 6h. After removal of surface-bound EVs
  and ligands, internalized EVs were analyzed by using flow cytometry. DMSO-treated
  cells and untreated cells were used as positive and blank control, respectively.
  (G) Goat PBMCs pretreated with MβCD, CPZ, or wortmannin for 1h were co-cultured
  with equal quantities of EVs-PPRV or EVs-Mock for 48 h, respectively. Then, SLAM
  expression on the recipient cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Scale bar = 30
  μm. Data are given as means ± standard deviation (SD) from three independent experiments.
  P values were calculated using Student’s t test. An asterisk indicates a comparison
  with the indicated control. *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01; n.s., not significant.
