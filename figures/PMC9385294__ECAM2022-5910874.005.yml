caption: The ERK1/2 signaling is involved in the regulation of the exosomal miR-221-3p/FGF2
  axis on ASMC progression. (a), (b) TGF-β1-treated ASMCs were incubated with BMSCs-derived
  exosomes alone or together with transfection with pcDNA-FGF2. The protein levels
  of p-ERK1/2 and ERK1/2 were detected by western blot analysis. TGF-β1-treated ASMCs
  were incubated with BMSCs-derived exosomes in the absence or presence of ERK1/2
  signaling activator TBHQ. (c), (d) The protein levels of p-ERK1/2 and ERK1/2 were
  detected by western blot analysis. (e) ASMC proliferation was measured by using
  the CCK-8 assay. (f), (g) ASMC migration was measured by transwell assay. (h)–(j)
  The protein expression of fibronectin and collagen III was analyzed by using Western
  blot analysis. Data from at least three independent experiments were presented as
  mean ± SD ∗P < 0.05.
