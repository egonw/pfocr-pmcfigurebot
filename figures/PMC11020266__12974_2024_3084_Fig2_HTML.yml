caption: NSA or Mdivi-1 inhibited the activation of GSDMD/Drp1 signal pathway in the
  hippocampus of SAE mice. A Representative images of GSDMD (green) in the hippocampal
  CA1 region. B Quantification of GSDMD fluorescence in the hippocampal CA1 region.
  Data are presented as the mean ± SEM (n = 4–6 mice/group). DAPI staining is shown
  in blue. Scale bar = 50 μm. C Representative western blotting and quantitative analysis
  of the protein levels of GSDMD and cleaved GSDMD (GSDMD-N) in the hippocampus. Data
  are presented as the mean ± SEM (n = 4 mice/group). D Representative images of Drp1
  (red) in the hippocampal CA1 region. E Quantification of Drp1 fluorescence in the
  hippocampal CA1 region. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM (n = 4–6 mice/group).
  F Representative western blotting and quantitative analysis of the protein levels
  of Drp1 in the hippocampus. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM (n = 4 mice/group).
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 versus the indicated groups. G Immunoprecipitation
  of GSDMD and Drp1 from mouse hippocampus (n = 6). Hippocampal lysates were subjected
  to immunoprecipitation using either an anti-GSDMD antibody, or an anti-Drp1 antibody
  or IgG control, followed by western blotting with anti-Drp1 and anti-GSDMD antibodies
