caption: Mimics and biosynthesis of phosphoserine. (A) Structures of phosphoserine
  and its mimics. (B) Phosphoserine is a biosynthetic intermediate of serine in E.
  coli. This pathway can be altered for GCE purposes to elevate (for pSer GCE) or
  eliminate (for nhpSer GCE) intracellular concentrations of the free phosphoserine
  amino acid. Residual pSer produced by transaminases other than SerC can be reduced
  further by overexpression of serB in serC knockout strains.
