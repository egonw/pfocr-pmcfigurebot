caption: 'A schematic presentation of the molecular targets of multikinase and tyrosine
  kinase inhibitors. Some of the pathways that the VEGF signaling cascade includes
  are: the Ras/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathway. The former is implicated in gene expression,
  as well as cell proliferation, while the latter in cell survival. Similarly, the
  PDGF and FLT3 signaling cascade are also related to PI3K/AKT and Ras/MAPK pathways,
  with the latter being closely associated with cell proliferation, differentiation,
  and survival. The mutation of all the above lead to over-proliferation and enhanced
  survival. In this scheme we demonstrate some of the main inhibitors for FLT3, VEGFR
  and PDGR mutant receptors. The figure was created with BioRender.com (accessed on
  27 April 2020) (QN23UJU88O agreement number).'
