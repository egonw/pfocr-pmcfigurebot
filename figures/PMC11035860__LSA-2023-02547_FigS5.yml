  of cancer support cancer porphyrin overdrive
caption: (A) Up-regulation of gene expression for some enzymes of the heme biosynthetic
  pathway in ∼10,000 patient-derived tumors. ALAS2 is only expressed in myeloid leukemias.
  (B) Genes for HMBS, the fourth enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway, and FLVCR1,
  the heme exporter, are among the most up-regulated in over 80% of all tumors. Oncogenic
  signaling genes (in blue) AURKA, KRAS, and MYC are up-regulated in over 90%, 60%,
  and 50% of all tumor types, respectively. Orange shading denotes up-regulation of
  gene expression; blue shading denotes down-regulation of gene expression as compared
  to the normal tissue. The scale of the y-axis indicates the degree of over- or underexpression.
  (C) Expression of ALAD, encoding the second enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway,
  is down-regulated in tumors, whereas the gene for the third enzyme of the pathway,
  HMBS, is overexpressed in most of the tumors. FLVCR1, encoding a heme exporter,
  is overexpressed in tumors, whereas HPX, for the heme scavenger hemopexin, is more
  abundantly expressed in normal tissues. Pairwise P-values were calculated using
  the Mann–Whitney test to assess statistical significance. Data are from the GTEx
  project and TCGA program. FC, fold change; scRNAseq, single-cell RNA sequencing.
