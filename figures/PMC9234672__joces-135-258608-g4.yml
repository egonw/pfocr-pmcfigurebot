caption: 'Primary cilium expression and length in the developing murine cerebellum.
  (A) Confocal images showing Arl13b expression in developing mouse cerebellum (E12.5
  and E13.5) (RL, rhombic lip; E, embryonic day). Counterstaining by DAPI. Insets
  showing higher magnification (3.5×). Scale bars: 25 µm. (B) Confocal images showing
  Arl13b and tdTomato expression in the developing mouse cerebellum (E15.5 RL, E15.5
  EGL, P0, P7) (P, postnatal day; RL, rhombic lip; EGL, external granular layer; IGL,
  internal granular layer). Insets showing higher magnification (5×) . Scale bars:
  25 µm. Images in A and B representative of n=3 experimental repeats. (C) Plot showing
  the average ratio of ciliated CGNPs (i.e. Arl13b+/tdTomato+ cells) per location
  and developmental timepoint. Results represent median and complete range. n=3 biological
  replicates. (D) Box-and-whisker plot showing the average CGNP primary cilium length
  per location and developmental timepoint. n=3 biological replicates. The box represents
  the 25–75th percentiles, and the median is indicated. The whiskers show the minimum
  to maximum. *P<0.05; ***P<0.001 (ordinary one-way ANOVA with Tukey''s post-hoc test).'
