figure_title: Exogenous LPA enhanced inflammatory response in vitro and vivo
caption: A Effect of si-GPAT3 or si-N.C. on TG content in KCs stimulated with LPS
  (1 μg/ml) for 24 h (n = 3). B Bodipy 493/503 fluorescence visualized by fluorescence
  microscopy (scale bars represent 50 μm) (n = 3). C LPA concentrations in the supernatant
  of KCs after LPS (100 ng/ml 12 h) stimulated and with or without si-GPAT3 (n = 3).
  D The mRNA expression of IL-1β, NLRP3, IL-1α and IL-6 in KCs treated with LPA (30 μM
  12 h) (n = 3). E, F The effects of exogenous LPA (30 μM 12 h) on the protein expression
  of inflammatory factors IL-1β, NLRP3, COX2, IL-1α and IL-6 in KCs (n = 3). G Experimental
  design of mice treated with LPA. H, I The contents of LDH, IL-6 and IL-1βin plasma
  of LPA treated with mice (n = 6). J, K Representative images and quantification
  of HE staining (Scale bars represent 100 μm) and CD68 IHC (Scale bars represent
  200 μm) after LPA treatment in liver of mice (n = 3). Data represents mean ± SEM.
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
