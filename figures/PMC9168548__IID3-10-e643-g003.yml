caption: iNOS deficiency inhibits the MAPK signaling pathway peritoneal macrophages
  were treated with ConA (0, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 μg/ml) for 0.5 h (A) and 1 h
  (B). Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoblotting with the indicated
  antibodies. β‐Actin was chosen as a loading control. iNOS, inducible nitric oxide
  synthase‐deficient; MAPK, mitogen‐activated protein kinase; SEM, standard error
  of the mean.

  the MAPK signals in concanavalin A‐induced hepatitis.
