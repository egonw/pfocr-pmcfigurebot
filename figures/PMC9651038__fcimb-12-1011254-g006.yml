caption: Characteristics of the oropharyngeal metabolome in IAV pneumonia and healthy
  volunteer groups. (A) Differential Pathway enrichment analysis based on differential
  metabolites between the two groups. (B) The crucial pathway with the highest correlation
  with metabolite differences between groups F and H was identified following metabolic
  pathway analysis of differential metabolites. In the bubble chart, each bubble represents
  a metabolic pathway. The X-axis and bubble size indicate the size of the impact
  value of the pathway; the Y-axis and bubble color indicate the p-value (-lnp) of
  the enrichment analysis. F, IAV pneumonia group; H, healthy group; IAV, influenza
  A virus.
