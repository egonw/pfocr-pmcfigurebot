caption: Immunohistochemical analysis of mTOR and metabolic pathway markers in papillary
  (PRCC) and clear cell renal cell carcinomas (CCRCC). The expression of p-mTOR (marker
  for mTOR kinase activity), p-S6 (mTORC1 activity marker), Rictor (marker of the
  amount of mTORC2), GLUT1, HXK2, PFKP (glycolysis markers), G6PD (pentose phosphate
  pathway marker), GLS (glutaminolysis marker), ACSS2 (marker for acetate consumption),
  CPT1A (fatty acid β-oxidation marker), ATPB (OXPHOS marker), COX IV, and TOM20 (mitochondrial
  markers) was analyzed in normal kidney, PRCCs, and CCRCCs. The detected characteristic
  differences in enzyme expression profiles between PRCCs and CCRCCs were highlighted
  by red frame. Immunohistochemistry (DAB chromogen–brown) and hematoxylin counterstaining
  were used. Scale bars indicate 50 μm.
