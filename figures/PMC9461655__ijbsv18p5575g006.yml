caption: Efforts of ectopic TRPM4 expression on the level of cytosolic calcium concentration,
  calpain activity and the remodeling of cytoskeleton. (A) TRPM4 expression remarkably
  increased the level of cytosolic Ca2+. (B) The [Ca2+]i level was evidently decreased
  after EGTA treatment compared with CaCl2-treatment and BAPTA-AM+CaCl2-treatment
  control groups. (C) TRPM4 expression enhanced the calpain activity. (D) Expression
  of calpain examined by western blot.
article_title: A novel methylated cation channel TRPM4 inhibited colorectal cancer
  metastasis through Ca2+/Calpain-mediated proteolysis of FAK and suppression of PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  signaling pathway.
