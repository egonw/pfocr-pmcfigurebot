caption: Relative glucose content in source leaves and sink tissues of N. benthamiana
  plants with pPVX or pPVX(frKPILP) systemic infection. The level of glucose in source
  leaves of control plants was taken as 1. Mean values and standard errors are presented.
  Bars without shared letters indicate significant differences at p<0.05 (ANOVA, Tukey’s
  HSD).
