caption: Identification of immune-related signatures and construction of IRIRScore
  prognostic model. (A) Volcano plot on immunotherapeutic response related DEGs between
  the responders and non-responders in anti-PD-L1 cohort. The green dots represent
  downregulated genes, while the red dots represent upregulated genes. (B) Venn diagram
  of the intersection between the immunotherapeutic response related DEGs and IRGs.
  (C) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of IRIGs. (D) GO analysis of IRIGs. (E) The
  coefficients of the 6 IRIGs related to prognosis of colon cancer. (F) Forest plot
  showing the HR of each IRIG. (G) The distribution of samples in the high- and low
  risk score groups and their relationship with OS, and the expression pattern of
  6 prognostic signatures in high- and low risk score groups. (H) Kaplan-Meier curve
  exhibited that OS of patients in the low-risk score group was significantly higher
  than those in the high-risk score group. (I) Time-dependent ROC curve analysis of
  the IRIRScore model.
