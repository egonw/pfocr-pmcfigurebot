caption: NF-κB signalling promotes the proliferation and migration of glioblastoma
  is partly dependent on EZH2. a Volcano plots illustrate differentially regulated
  genes expression between WT and p65/EZH2 KO LN229 cells identified by RNA-seq. Values
  are presented as the log2 of foldchange. b Heatmaps of candidate genes relative
  to proliferation and migration were both regulated by NF-κB and EZH2. c RT-qPCR
  detects the mRNA levels of candidate genes relative to proliferation and migration
  in WT and EZH2 KO LN229 cells treated with LPS. d-f CCK-8, colony formation, transwell
  assays in the LN229 cell line of WT, p65 KO, p65 KO with p65 ectopic overexpression
  and p65 KO with EZH2 ectopic overexpression groups or WT, EZH2 KO, EZH2 KO with
  EZH2 ectopic overexpression and EZH2 KO with p65 ectopic overexpression groups.
  g-i CCK-8, colony formation, transwell assays in WT, EZH2 KO and EZH2 KO with EZH2
  ectopic overexpression LN229 cells treated with PBS or LPS. Values are expressed
  as the means±SD from three experiments, and the asterisk indicates the statistical
  significance compared to the controls (*, p < 0.05, **, p < 0.01, ***, p < 0.001,
  ****, p < 0.0001).
