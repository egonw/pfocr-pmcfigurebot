caption: GS downregulates the constitutive and inducible STAT3 signaling. U266 cells
  were incubated with increasing concentrations of GS for 48 h, and (A) protein expressions
  of p-STAT3, STAT3, Bcl-xL, XIAP, Cyclin D1, p21Cip1 p27Kip1, and β-actin were determined.
  (B) GS-mediated inhibition of IL-6 secretion. GS treated U266 cells supernatant
  was collected, and quantitative analysis for IL-6 was performed using a multiplexing
  kit. The graph displays mean ± SD (n = 3 and ** p < 0.001). IL-6-induced STAT3 activation
  in MM cells; 24 h serum-starved (C) U266 and (D) RPMI 8226 cells were pre-treated
  with 50 μM GS for 48 h and then with IL-6 (100 ng/mL) for 30 min. Total proteins
  were extracted and probed against p-STAT3, STAT3, HMGB1, and HSP60. (E) Association
  of STAT3 and HMGB1. U266 cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated either with normal
  rabbit IgG (RIgG) or antibody against STAT3 using sepharose 4G. Immunoprecipitated
  proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibody against HMGB1.
