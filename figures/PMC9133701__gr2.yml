caption: miR-423-5p was inhibited in GC cells and sponged by CircPVT1. (A) RT-PCR
  examined the miR-423-5p expression. (B–E) AGS and SGC-7901 cells were transfected
  with the miR-423-5p mimic or miR-423-5p inhibitor. RT-PCR checked the miR-423-5p
  expression and CircPVT1 expression. (F) StarBase2.0 predictions on targeted sites
  between CircPVT1 and miR-423-5P. (G) Luciferase activity. ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001, versus
  NC groups.
