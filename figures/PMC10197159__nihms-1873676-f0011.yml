caption: A) Volcano plot of global transcriptome of differentially expressed genes
  comparing mouse Jak2-V617F monocytes in stiff, elastic versus stiff, viscous gels.
  Bulk RNA-sequencing was performed in duplicate. Genes marked in red are above thresholds
  of both fold change = 21 and p-value = 10−2 threshold (dotted lines). Green indicates
  genes above fold change threshold, but below the p-value threshold. Blue indicates
  genes above the p-values threshold, but below the fold change threshold. Grey indicates
  genes that are not significantly differentially expressed. Data was obtained from
  n = 2 biological replicates. B) Normalized expression of JAK-STAT pathway genes
  in Jak2-V617F monocytes cultured in elastic versus viscous hydrogels, with linear
  regression fit (black line). Genes enriched in elastic gels are marked in red and
  appear above the linear regression (viscous in blue). Data points indicate mean
  normalized expression of n = 2 biological replicates from a single experiment (one
  of each gender). C) IL6 and LIF levels of conditioned media from WT or Jak2-V617F
  monocytes in viscous (blue) or elastic (red) hydrogels. Data shown from a single
  experiment with n samples as individual data points collected from n = 2 biological
  replicates (one of each gender). P-value<0.05 indicates statistically significant
  difference by Brown–Forsythe and Welch ANOVA test with Dunnett’s T3 multiple comparisons
  test.
