caption: Three signaling pathways for AM polarization activated by RSV infection,
  cytokines represented by IFN and GM-CSF, intercellular communication using the Notch-Jagged
  pathway as an example, and the direct activation signal by RSV. RSV, respiratory
  syncytial virus; NK, natural killer cells; IFN, interferon; GM-CSF, granulocyte–macrophage
  colony-stimulating factor; AMs, alveolar macrophages; ECs, epithelial cells; M,
  macrophage; infMo, inflammatory monocytes; MIF, macrophage migration inhibitory
  factor; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α.
article_title: Alveolar macrophages and airway hyperresponsiveness associated with
  respiratory syncytial virus infection.
