figure_title: Characterization of the GTA regulatory pathway
caption: (A) Total DNA extraction from different strains grown up to stationary phase.
  DNA was purified and separated via gel electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. (B)
  Same as A with total DNA extracted from strains bearing a high-copy plasmid with
  the xylose promoter driving expression of either nothing (empty), gafY alone, gafZ
  alone, or both gafY and gafZ in their native arrangement. (C) Simple genetic diagram
  of how the gta gene cluster is hypothesized to be regulated. (D) Transcriptomic
  analysis comparing gafYZ overexpression to an empty vector control in stationary
  phase using RNA-seq. The 10 up-regulated loci from the ΔrogA RNA-seq are shown with
  their corresponding shading for the log2 fold change of each gene during gafYZ overexpression.
  Binding of RogA, GafY, and GafZ, as determined by ChIP-seq, are shown for each locus’
  promoter by a black, gray, or white dot, respectively. (E) Log2 fold change of each
  gene during gafYZ overexpression compared to an empty vector is plotted as a function
  of the gene’s log2 fold change in a ΔrogA mutant compared to the wild-type strain.
  Genes in the GTA cluster are highlighted in dark green, gafY and gafZ in light green,
  and rogA in red. R2 of the GTA cluster genes and gafYZ (log2 transformed) is 0.92.
  Data are available in . (F) Transcript abundance of 4 different categories out of
  all transcripts in different RNA-seq samples. Wedges are colored according to the
  legend. Data are available in . (G) Western blot analysis of co-immunoprecipitation
  of GafY with immunoprecipitation of Flag-GafZ. ParB served as a non-associated protein
  control. (H) ChIP-seq profiles of GafY with an anti-GafY antibody in either ΔrogA
  (black) or ΔrogA ΔgafY (gray) and FLAG-GafZ with an anti-FLAG antibody in either
  ΔrogA gafZ::FLAG-gafZ (dark blue) or ΔrogA (light blue). Profiles were plotted with
  the x-axis representing genomic positions and the y-axis representing the number
  of reads per kilobase pair per million mapped reads (RPKM) using custom R scripts.
  Data are available in . GTA, gene transfer agent.
