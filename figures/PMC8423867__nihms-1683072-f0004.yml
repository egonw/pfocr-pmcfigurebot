figure_title: Summary of the protein acetylation in regulation of cancer-associated
  events
caption: A. Protein lysine acetylation is widely involved in modulating the protein
  stability and activity of oncoproteins and tumor suppressors, which are involved
  in various cellular process such as genomic stability control, angiogenesis, immune
  response and glucose metabolism. B. Representative of oncoproteins and tumor suppressors
  regulated by lysine acetylation.
