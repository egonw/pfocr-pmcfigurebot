caption: 'ESI-MS spectra of DMSO, fraction 6 (F6), and fraction 8 (F8) correspond
  to the blank (1:1 0.1% formic acid LCMS grade water: LCMS grade EtOH) in which they
  were dissolved. From the lower spectrum to the upper one is for blank, DMSO, F6,
  and F8 respectively. The molecular mass/charge (m/z) is along the X-axis where the
  Y-axis denotes % of the relative abundance of each molecule.'
