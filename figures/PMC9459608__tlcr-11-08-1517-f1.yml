caption: Schematic depicting of downstream signaling effectors in KISS-1/GPR54 and
  Î²2-adrenergic receptor pathways following activation by extracellular ligands, such
  as kisspeptin neuropeptides and norepinephrine that are related to psychological
  stress. Different classes of G-protein-coupled receptors can activate or inhibit
  LATS1/2 in the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway. Detailed explanation is provided
  throughout the text, as well as the definition of the abbreviations of genes and
  proteins. Figure created in Biorender.com.
