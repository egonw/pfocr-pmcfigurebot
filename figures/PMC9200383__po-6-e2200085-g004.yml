caption: Systematization and results for GS scoreâ€“based classification. (A) Comparison
  of HRD score and Sig3 ratio stratified by TP53 mutation and sex. Further stratification
  is applied using biallelic BRCA1/2 alteration (including BRCA1 methylation, left),
  biallelic HRR pathway gene alteration (middle), biallelic BRCA1/2 alteration in
  Jonsson's data set (right). *, **, and *** stand for P < .05, P < .01, and P < .001
  in the Mann-Whitney U test, respectively. (B) HRD score and Sig3 ratio pairwise
  distribution when patients are divided by sex and TP53 mutation status. Black dots
  represent HRR pathway gene-altered cases, and gray dots indicate nonaltered cases.
  Dotted lines are placed at the optimal cutoff values determined by ROC curve analysis.
  (C) Differences in ROC curves and optimal cutoff values for HRR pathway gene alterations
  in HRD score and Sig3 ratio among the four groups. (D) Per stratification, Spearman
  correlation coefficients between the HRD score and the Sig3 ratio, optimized scar
  score cutoff values, and resulting AUCs are shown. AUC, area under the curve; GS,
  genomic scar high; HRD, homologous recombination deficiency; HRR, homologous recombination
  repair; ROC, receiver operating characteristic; Sig3, mutational signature 3; TCGA,
