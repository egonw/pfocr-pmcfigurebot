caption: 'Structure of KC-A (A) and its effects on classic androgens and 11-keto-androgens
  regarding the induction of androgen signaling in C4-2 (B,E), LNCaP (C,F) and 22Rv1
  (D,G) cells. The cells were pretreated for 2 h without or with 5 μM KC-A, and then
  cultured for 24 h in the absence or presence of 1 nM DHT or 10 nM Adione (B–D),
  1 nM 11KDHT or 10 nM 11KAdione (E–G). The mRNA expression levels were analyzed by
  RT-qPCR analysis. ** p < 0.01, * p < 0.05, NS p > 0.05 denotes significantly different
  from the cells treated with DMSO alone. ## p < 0.01, # p < 0.05, NS p > 0.05 denotes
  significantly different from the cells treated with 1 nM DHT, 10 nM Adione, 1 nM
  11KDHT or 11KAdione alone.'
