caption: ATM activation is significantly reduced in iAs-exposed Ker-CT cells. A. Immunoblot
  for ATM pathway signaling (ATM and CHEK2) and ATR activation in quadruplicate Ker-CT
  cell cultures exposed to 0 or 100 nM sodium arsenite for 8 weeks. B. Densitometric
  analysis of ATM activation (ATM-pSer1981/t-ATM). C. Densitometric analysis of CHEK2
  activation (CHEK-2pThr68/t-CHEK2). D. Densitometric analysis of ATR activation (ATR-pSer428/t-ATR).
  Statistical analysis was completed by unpaired two-tailed t-test; *p â‰¤ 0.05
