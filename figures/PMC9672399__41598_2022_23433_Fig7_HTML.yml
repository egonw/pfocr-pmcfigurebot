caption: Cellular migration and proliferation are partially regulated through the
  IL-6 signalling pathway. In vitro scratch assay evaluating the effect of exosomes
  and anti-IL-6 treatments on the migration of dermal fibroblasts according to the
  culture method (a,b). Fibroblast were pre-treated with 250 μg of exosomes with or
  without 2 μg/mL anti-IL-6 prior to the assay and retreated with 250 μg of exosomes
  at the initial time point. Exosomal treatments were composed of a pool of an equal
  part of the six populations. Images were captured at various time points (0, 12 h,
  24 h and 38 h) and closing rate was measured by reporting the total scratch area
  at each time point to the area at the initial time. Scale bar = 500 μm. n = 3. Cell
  proliferation ratio of fibroblasts treated with 2D- or 3D-exosomes and anti-IL-6
  using a BrdU cell proliferation ELISA assay (c). Ratios were reported as a fold
  change compared to the non-treated condition. n = 9–18. Quantification of secreted
  IL-6 by ELISA (d). Exosomal IL-6 concentration is represented in ng/mL and normalised
  to the number of cells (gDNA). n = 6. Phosphorylation level of STAT (Tyr705) in
  fibroblasts treated with both types of exosomes (e). Phosphorylation levels were
  report to total STAT3 and are shown as fold change, relative to the non-treated
  control. n = 3. Exosomal localization of IL-6. Equivalent amounts of all samples
  were resolved with SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting. Note that the cropped
  images only are shown for conciseness; see supplementary figures section to see
  the original blots (f). Microparticles were treated with 100 mg/mL proteinase K
  and/or 1% Triton X-100. An equal amount of total exosomal proteins were then analysed
  by Western blot. Note that the cropped images only are shown for conciseness; see
  supplementary figures section to see the original blots Note again that the cropped
  images only are shown for conciseness; see supplementary figures section to see
  the original blots. Statistical analyses were performed by a one-way ANOVA with
  Tukey’s multiple comparison test. Graphs show mean ± SD. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01
  and **** P < 0.0001.
