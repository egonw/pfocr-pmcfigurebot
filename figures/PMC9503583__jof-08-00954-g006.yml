caption: UvSTE50 regulates stress responses in U. virens. (A) Mycelial radial growth
  of the wild-type strain Jt209, ΔUvste50 mutant, and the complemented strain Uvste50-c
  on PSA or PSA containing exogenous stress agents including 0.5 M NaCl, 0.6 M sorbitol,
  500 μg/mL CFW, 100μg/mL CR, 0.05% SDS, or 0.05% H2O2. Photographs were obtained
  after incubation at 28 °C for 20 days in the dark. (B) The growth inhibition rate
  of strains cultured on plates with different stress agents. Measurements of growth
  inhibition rate were calculated relative to the growth rate of each untreated control.
  Mean and standard deviation were calculated from three replicates. (C) Conidia germination
  rates were analyzed after treatment without or with 0.3 M NaCl, 0.3 M sorbitol or
  0.01% H2O2 for 20 h. Bar, 20 μm. * represent significant differences between the
  mutant ΔUvste50 and wild-type strain Jt209, as estimated by Duncan’s new multiple
  range test (p < 0.05).
