caption: Effect of DUSP1 knockdown on MAPKs/NF-κB signaling pathway induced by BCG
  infection. (A) THP-1 cells were transfected with siRNA-NC (negative control) or
  siRNA-DUSP1 for 24 h, and then infected with BCG and cultured for 6 h. The expression
  of p-p38, p38, p-ERK, ERK, p-JNK, JNK, p-NF-κB p65 and t-NF-κB p65 were detected
  by Western blotting. (B–E) MAPKs/NF-κB signaling pathway results of grayscale analysis
  of key protein expression. (F) THP-1 cells were transfected with siRNA-NC (negative
  control) or siRNA-DUSP1 for 24 h, and then infected with BCG and cultured for 6 h.
  The expression levels of p-p38, p-ERK, p-JNK and p-NF-κB p65 were detected by immunofluorescence.
  Scale bar, 75 μm. All data are represented as mean ± SD (n = 3). (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001).
