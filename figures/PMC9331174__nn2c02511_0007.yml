caption: 'Schematic representation of free radical production in sperm cells and drug
  treatments. Free radicals in sperm are produced in two main sources: cell membrane
  in the acrosome (indicated with labels 1 and 2) and mitochondria (labels 3 and 4).
  Normally, in the presence of capacitation factors, calcium ions go through calcium
  channels (CatSper) and bind NOX5, which produce superoxide radicals. Apocynin acts
  as an inhibitor of NOX5, as a result a decrease in the superoxide production is
  seen (label 1). In label 2, an alternative pathway for NOX5-dependent free radical
  production under uncapacitating conditions is presented. Under uncapacitating conditions,
  there are no calcium ions in the culture medium. However, the presence of calcium
  ion reservoirs in vesicles containing CatSper channels in the acrosome has been
  previously reported., We propose that progesterone can activate intracellular CatSper
  channels allowing the release of calcium ions to the cytosol and therefore activate
  NOX5 and increase free radical production under uncapacitating conditions.'
