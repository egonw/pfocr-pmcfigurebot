caption: 'Biosynthesis pathway of rice aroma with gene expression and free amino acid
  content: (A) glutamate content; (B) proline content; (C) γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
  content; (D) leaf aroma; (E) grain aroma. The aroma score was calculated based on
  the 1–4 scale, where 1—no aroma; 2—mild aroma; 3—moderate aroma; 4—excellent aroma;
  (F) relative expression of OsBadh1; (G) relative expression of OsP5CS1; (H) relative
  expression of OsP5CS2; (I) relative expression of OsGAD1; (J) relative expression
  of OsGAD2; (K) relative expression of OsGAD3; (L) relative expression of OsGAD4.
  The rice cultivars Huaidao#5 (WT_HD) and Jiahua#1 (WT_JH) were the experimental
  control (nontreated) for their respective mutant lines, and OsActin was an internal
  reference in the 2−∆∆CT method. Data are shown as the mean and standard deviation
  of 3 biological replicates with 3 technical replications. Data with different letters
  (a, b, c, etc.) represent significance at a 0.05 level, using the Tukey Method.
  PRODH, proline dehydrogenase; GSA, gamma glutamyl semialdehyde; P5C, ∆1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate;
  P5CR, ∆1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase; GAB-ald, γ-aminobutyraldehyde; red cross
  sign (X), knockout mutations in OsBadh2 gene.'
