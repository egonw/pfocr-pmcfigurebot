figure_title: LUAD cells have a polyclonal origin, and the UBE2C + cancer cell subcluster
  drives the invasion of LUAD
caption: 'a UMAP of scRNA-seq showing eight subclusters consisting of 12,879 epithelial
  cells from nine LUAD specimens. b Large-scale CNVs were observed in four types of
  cancer subclusters (Epi-C0, Epi-C1, Epi-C3 and Epi-C6) compared to normal endothelial
  cells. The color shows the log2 CNV ratio. Red represents amplifications, and blue
  represents deletions. c Area plot showing changes in eight subtypes of epithelial
  cells at three pathological stages of LUAD. d IF analysis of LUAD TMAs (14 AIS cases,
  18 MIA cases and 17 IAC cases) showing cancer cells (Epi-C6: UBE2C + ) in the three
  stages of LUAD. e ssGSEA validated that the expression level of UBE2C + cancer cells
  increased in the process of cancer invasion from bulk RNA-seq data (20 AIS cases,
  17 MIA cases and 23 IAC cases). f Survival curves of patients with LUAD according
  to gene signatures of UBE2C + cancer cells (Epi-C6) in TCGA-LUAD dataset (upper
  panel: DFS; lower panel: OS). g Heatmap of the GSVA results showing differences
  in pathway activity among different cancer cell subclusters from scRNA-seq data.
  h. Pseudotime analysis by Monocle2 shows the potential evolutionary trajectory of
  LUAD. Upper: AT2 (Epi-C5) as the root; Down: Clara cell (Epi-C7) as the root.'
