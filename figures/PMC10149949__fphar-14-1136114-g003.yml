caption: 'Regorafenib/rosuvastatin co-treatment exerted synergistical antitumor effect
  by inhibiting intrinsic MAPK signaling pathway. (A, B) Immunoblotting analysis to
  examine p-ERK/ERK and p-MEK/MEK expression levels in SW620 cells treated with regorafenib
  (range, 0.625–5 μM) or rosuvastatin (range, 6.25–50 μM). (C) Immunoblotting analysis
  to examine p-ERK/ERK and p-MEK/MEK expression levels in SW620 cells treated with
  regorafenib (0.625 μM), rosuvastatin (6.25 μM) and combinational treatment. SW620
  cells were starved in serum-free RPMI-1640 media overnight and then treated with
  regorafenib/rosuvastatin or DMSO for 4 h. Before harvested, cells were treated with
  500 ng/mL EGF for 30 min. The data are shown as mean ± SD of three replicates assays.
  n. s, no sense; †/Δ/*/#, †/p < 0.05; ††/ΔΔ, p < 0.01; ΔΔΔ, p < 0.001 (†: vs. EGF
  + DMSO group; Δ: vs. DMSO group; *: vs. Regorafenib group; #: vs. Rosuvastatin group).
