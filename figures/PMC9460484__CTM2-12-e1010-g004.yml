caption: 'Transcription factors (TFs) and corresponding target genes specific to cell
  types by the SCENIC and validation of NR1H4‐phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) in proximal
  tubular epithelial cells (PTECs). (A) The regulation of TFs among different types
  of cells by the average algorithm; (B) the top five regulons (TFs and corresponding
  target gene candidates) in PTECs; (C) the activity of the NR1H4 regulons of PTECs
  by the average algorithm. The yellow line in the left plot represents the threshold
  of AUCs (.023) for the active expression of the genes in the NR1H4 regulon among
  PTECs. The y‐axis of the left plot represents the cell numbers corresponding to
  the AUC value on the x‐axis. The blue points in the middle left plot represent cells
  with regulon AUC > .023, whereas the grey points represent cells with regulon AUC ≤ .023.
  The red points in the middle right plot represent the original regulon AUC value
  of each cell, among which the darker red points indicate a greater regulon AUC value.
  The red points in the right plot represent the NR1H4 expression of each cell; (D)
  bubble plots of the main signalling pathway from PTECs to infiltrated immune cells
  among all samples (left) and detailed gene expression in the COMPLEMENT and CCL
  pathways, which is different among the PTECs in which NR1H4 is highly expressed
  and those in which NR1H4 is poorly expressed. PT high: NR1H4 highly expressed PTECs
  (count of NR1H4 > 0); PT low: NR1H4 poorly expressed PTECs (count of NR1H4 = 0);
  (E) the co‐localization and relatively higher expression of NR1H4 and PAH in PTECs
  among samples with different grades of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy
  (IFTA); (F) immunofluorescence of NR1H4 (green) and PAH (red) in the mouse kidney
  with and without folic acid (FA) injection. PAH: phenylalanine hydroxylase; (G)
  Masson staining and semi‐quantification of injured tubules and deposited collagens
  in WT and NR1H4−/−mice with and without FA injection; (H) the expression of PAH,
  apoptosis‐related (Bax and Aparf), necroptosis‐related (Ripk1 and Ripk3) and autophagy‐related
  (Atg5 and Becn1) mRNAs in WT and NR1H4−/−mice kidney with and without FA injection;
  (I) the expression of NR1H4, PAH and apoptosis‐related proteins was determined by
  performing the Western blot assay in the WT and NR1H4−/−mouse kidney with and without
  FA injection. (J) Masson staining and semi‐quantification of injured tubules and
  deposited collagens were performed in WT mice administered with or without the NR1H4
  inhibitor  z ‐guggulsterone (ZGU) or Gly‐β‐MCA (Gly); (K) the expression of NR1H4,
  PAH and apoptosis‐related proteins was determined by performing the Western blot
  assay in WT mice gavaged with or without the NR1H4 inhibitor ZGU or Gly; (L) graphic
