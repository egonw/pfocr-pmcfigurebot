caption: The ROCK1‐Drp1 signalling pathway mediates Ang II‐induced mitochondrial fission.
  (A and B) ROCK1 expression in human podocytes in different groups. (C and D) Immunofluorescence
  staining of human podocytes with DAPI and ROCK1 (green) in different groups. Scale
  bar = 20 μm. (E) Representative image of mitochondrial morphology in podocytes stimulated
  with Ang II for 24 h as measured by MitoTracker Red staining. Scale bar = 3 μm.
  (F and G) Average length and aspect ratio of podocyte mitochondria in each group.
  (H and I) Western blot of pDrp1(S637) protein expression in different groups. *p < 0.05,
  n = 3
article_title: Sirt6 deficiency contributes to mitochondrial fission and oxidative
  damage in podocytes via ROCK1‐Drp1 signalling pathway.
