caption: 'Effect of silencing miR-21 on the migration of SiHa cells. Cellular migration
  was evaluated by a wound healing assay. The microscopy images were captured at 0
  h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h after the stria was made. The migration of SiHa cells was
  significantly reduced at 24 h after transfection with siRNAs to miR-21. Panel (A):
  Microscopy images of SiHa cell migration transfected with pSilencer 1.0-U6 empty
  vector plasmid (lanes a–d) or pSIMIR21-5P plasmid, respectively (lanes e–h). Panel
  (B): Analysis of SiHa cell migration transfected with pSilencer 1.0-U6 or pSIMIR21-5P
  plasmids. The data are expressed in averages + SE. p values < 0.05 are indicated
  with an asterisk. Following transfection, cells were observed in a Nikon Elipse
  Ts2 microscopy, and samples were analyzed using the 40× phase contrast objective.'
