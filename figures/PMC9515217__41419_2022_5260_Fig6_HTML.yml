figure_title: Treatment with a combination of alectinib and HI-032 synergistically
  inhibited the growth and enhanced the apoptosis of H2228 cells
caption: A Alectinib and HI-032 with different concentrations were added to H2228
  cells, and the two were used alone or in combination for 72 h, and the cell viability
  was detected by MTT assay. B Combined effects were measured using CI values. Quantification
  of the potency of the different combinations using the Chou-Talalay method as described
  in the Materials and Methods section. CI values <1.0 correspond to synergistic inhibition
  effects. C H2228 cells were treated with alectinib (0.1 μΜ) and HI-032 (2 μM) and
  dead cells were detected by Annexin V-FITC and PI double staining and analyzed by
  flow cytometry. Data are represented as mean ± standard deviation from triplicate
  experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. D H2228 cells were treated with alectinib (0.1 μΜ)
  and HI-032 (2 μM) for 24 h and the samples were analyzed by western blotting. Data
  are representative of results from triplicate experiments.
