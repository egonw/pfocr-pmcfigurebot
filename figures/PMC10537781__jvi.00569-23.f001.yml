caption: 'The ASFV I10L protein inhibits the TNF-α- and IL-1β-triggered NF-κB signaling
  pathway in HEK293T cells. (A) The ASFV pI10L inhibits TNF-α-triggered activation
  of the NF-κB promoter. HEK293T cells were transfected with pNF-κB-Fluc (0.1 µg),
  pRL-TK (0.01 µg), and the plasmids expressing different ASFV proteins (0.2 µg).
  Twenty hours later, the cells were treated with TNF-α (10 ng/mL) for 10 hours, after
  which the luciferase assays were performed. ★: pI10L. (B) The ASFV pI10L inhibits
  the TNF-α- and IL-1β-triggered activation of the NF-κB promoter in a dose-dependent
  manner. HEK293T cells were transfected with the pI10L-expressing plasmid at different
  concentrations (0, 0.01, 0.02, or 0.04 µg) along with pNF-κB-Fluc (0.1 µg) and pRL-TK
  (0.01 µg). Twenty hours later, the luciferase assay and immunoblotting analysis
  were performed after the cells were treated with TNF-α (10 ng/mL) or IL-1β (10 ng/mL)
  for 10 hours. (C) The ASFV pI10L inhibits the TNF-α- and IL-1β-triggered the transcription
  of proinflammatory cytokines. HEK293T cells were transfected with either the pRK
  (Vec) or the pFlag-pI10L (0.2 µg) for 20 hours, and RT-qPCR was performed following
  treatment with TNF-α (10 ng/mL) or IL-1β (10 ng/mL) for 6 hours. (D) The ASFV pI10L
  inhibits the TNF-α- and IL-1β-triggered phosphorylation of IκBα and p65. HEK293T
  cells were transfected with either the Vec or the pFlag-pI10L (0.2 µg) for 20 hours.
  The cells were then treated with TNF-α (20 ng/mL) or IL-1β (20 ng/mL) for 5, 10,
  or 20 minutes, followed by immunoblotting analysis. Densitometric analysis of protein
  expression level was performed with ImageJ software. The data shown are the mean
  ± SD from one representative experiment performed in triplicate (A to C). ***P <
  0.001 (unpaired t test).'
