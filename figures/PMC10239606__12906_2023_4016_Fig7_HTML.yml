caption: 'MOS suppresses CSC-like phenotypes by inhibiting Akt signaling pathways.
  H23 and A549 cells were treated with 5 µM of MOS and also pretreated with LY294002
  (5 µM) for 30 min before treating with MOS for 24 h. (A) The expression levels of
  CD133 and p-Akt were determined using anti-CD133 and anti-p-Akt (Ser473) antibody
  followed by Alexa Fluor 488-labeled secondary antibody and Hoechst 33342. The expression
  was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. (B) Bar graphs showed the quantitative
  results of A. Each value is the mean (± SD) from triplicate experiments. *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001 vs. control; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, and ###p < 0.001
  vs. MOS at 5 µM'
