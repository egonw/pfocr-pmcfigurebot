caption: 'Resveratrol down-regulates serum-induced VE-cadherin expression through
  decreasing the nuclear twist expression in PC-3 cells. Cells were treated with serum
  with or without RES for 24 h. (A) The same amount of proteins (25–30 μg) were analyzed
  by Western blot using the VE-cadherin antibody. As a loading control, β-actin was
  used. (B)) The mRNA levels were analyzed by RT-PCR using the VE-cadherin primer.
  As a loading control, β-actin primer was used. (C) The same amount of proteins (25–30 μg)
  were analyzed by Western blot using the twist antibody. β-actin was used as a control.
  Data present as the means ± SD of three independent experiments by analysis of Student’s
  t-test. *p < 0.05 and ***p < 0.001 versus untreated control; ##p < 0.01 and ###p < 0.001
  versus serum-treated control. (D) The serum-treated cells with or without RES for
  24 h were fixed, permeabilized and blocked. After probing with Twist antibody followed
  by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated secondary antibody,
  the cells were counterstained with propidium iodide (PI). The images were taken
  with a fluorescence microscope at 400 × . Scale bar = 50 μm.'
