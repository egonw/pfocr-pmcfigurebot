figure_title: NETs induce intestinal barrier injury through the TLR9–ER stress–ROS
  signaling pathway
caption: In the case of sepsis, increased neutrophils migrate and aggregate in the
  intestine and trigger NETosis. Excessive NETs formation can activate the TLR9–ER
  stress–ROS signaling pathway, which enhances intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis
  and the inflammatory response. Uncontrolled intestinal epithelial cell injury results
  in intestinal barrier disruption, leading to bacterial translocation.

  in sepsis by regulating TLR9-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway.
