caption: 'Performance of the D-Refined and D-MN models when predicting GIs in S. cerevisiae,
  S. pombe, H. sapiens and D. melanogaster. (A) Representation of schemes used to
  generate GIs in a hypothetical signaling pathway controlling fruit fly eye development.
  Gene A is in a positive signaling relationship with gene C (red arrow), gene B is
  in an inhibitory relationship with gene C (blue line) and gene C sends a signal
  that promotes eye development. In this example, a transgene is used to express either
  dominant negative or hyperactive forms of gene A specifically in the eye: the dominant
  negative gene A reduces pathway signaling which produces mildly rough eyes, while
  the hyperactive form causes a reduced eye with abnormal pigmentation. Both transgenes
  can be used either in a haploinsufficiency screen in which one copy of gene B or
  C is removed (gray circles), or overexpression screen in which gene B is overexpressed.
  Thickness of arrows and lines reflects changes in signaling levels. (Bâ€“E) Performance
  of the D-Refined (red), D-Refined with no sGO (orange), D-MN (blue), D-MN with no
  sGO (cyan) and null GI model (white) when predicting interacting (I) versus neutral
  (N) on the S. cerevisiae (B), S. pombe (C), H. sapiens (D) and D. melanogaster (E)
  GI datasets. Statistical analysis (error bars and asterisks) is similar to  with
  the asterisk color reflecting the model being compared (A color version of this
  figure appears in the online version of this article.)'
