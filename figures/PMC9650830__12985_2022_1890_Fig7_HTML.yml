caption: 'Disruption of the ethylene pathway in Nicotiana benthamiana makes it susceptible
  to infection with the cysteine-rich protein of the Chinese isolate of chrysanthemum
  virus B (CVB-CN CRP). a Silencing efficiency of virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS)
  assays was assessed by qRT-PCR at 10 days post inoculation (dpi). The data are given
  as means ± standard deviation of three biological replicates. The values represent
  relative mRNA levels against control groups (TRV:GFP-infiltrated N. benthamiana
  seedlings), values of which are set to 100%. Significant differences in expression
  are indicated with asterisks: (*) P < 0.05 or (**) P < 0.01; Tukey′s test. b Disease
  symptoms caused by PVX:CVB-CN CRP in the ethylene pathway impaired N. benthamiana
  seedlings at 9 dpi. TRV:GFP plants-inoculated with PVX:CRV-CN CRP were used as the
  control. c 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) content and relative viral
  RNA accumulation in the ethylene pathway-impaired N. benthamiana seedlings, as described
  in b. The data are given as means ± standard deviation of three biological replicates.
  The values represent ACC content or relative viral RNA levels against control groups
  (TRV:GFP-infiltrated N. benthamiana seedlings infected with PVX:CVB-CN CRP). Significant
  differences in expression are indicated with asterisks: (*) P < 0.05 or (**) P < 0.01;
  Tukey′s test'
