caption: BABA-induced changes in amino acid levels and their metabolic pathways. (A)
  Amino acids whose abundance in BABA-treated Marmande tomato plants differs significantly
  from that in water-treated controls. Data are means from three replicates; the errors
  are standard errors of means. Statistically significant differences recorded for
  each amino acid as determined by the t-test are indicated with different numbers
  of asterisks (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01). (B, C) Induction of genes belonging to the
  phenylpropanoid pathway (B) and glutamate metabolic pathway (C). E4P – erythrose-4-phosphate,
  PEP – phosphoenolpyruvate, CRSM – chorismic acid, CM – chorismic acid mutase, PPA
  – prephenate, PDH – prephenate dehydrogenasa, PDT – prephenate dehydratase, PAL
  – Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, CA – cinnamic acid, C4H – Cytochrome P450, PCA –
  p-coumaric acid, 4CL – 4-coumarate CoA ligase, THT – Tyramine N-(hydroxycinnamoyl)
  transferase, GM – Agmatine, ArgDC – Arginine decarboxylase, 2OG – 2-ketoglutarate,
  GluDC – Glutamate decarboxylase, GABA – gamma-Aminobutyric acid, AS1 – Asparagine
  synthase, P5CS – Gamma-glutamyl phosphate reductase, AstD – N-succinylglutamate
  5-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, P5C – 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate, P5CR – Pyrroline-5-carboxylate
  reductase, ProDH – Proline dehydrogenase, N.C. – transcript not changed, N.D. –
  transcript not detected.
