caption: Gene regulatory network for upregulated DEGs in FAI articular cartilage.
  The transcription factors MYOD1, MAFA, and ESRRG were the primary enriched network
  hubs for the pathway analysis (A). Normalized counts as well as the binding motif
  for each transcription factor are presented for MYOD1 (B), MAFA (C), and ESRRG (D).
  The size of a node represents the degree of a given gene, while the thickness of
  the edge connecting two nodes is positively associated with edge betweenness. DEG,
  differentially expressed gene; ESRRG, estrogen-related receptor gamma; FAI, femoroacetabular
  impingement; MAFA, Maf Bzip transcription factor A; MYOD1, myogenic differentiation
  1.
article_title: Whole-genome RNA sequencing identifies distinct transcriptomic profiles
  in impingement cartilage between patients with femoroacetabular impingement and
  hip osteoarthritis.
