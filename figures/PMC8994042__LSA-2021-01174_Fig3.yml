figure_title: Time-course confocal microscopy analysis indicates that the 85-90 IFITM3
  mutation affects the normal egress of IFITM3 from the Golgi
caption: 'HEK293T cells were examined by confocal microscopy at different times post
  ectopic DNA transfection to determine the localization of IFITM3 proteins over time.
  Representative pictures and graph presenting the distribution of IFITM3 in the Golgi
  (calculated as a Golgi/cytoplasm ratio on 39 to 62 cells per time point and per
  condition in two independent experiments, AVG, SEM and individual values). The table
  presents P-values obtained after a one-way ANOVA, Tukeyâ€™s multiple comparisons test
  between the indicated conditions: ns, nonsignificant; *P-value < 0.05; ****P-value
  < 0.0001. Source data are provided in the relevant section.Source data are available
  for this figure.'
article_title: A novel domain within the CIL regulates egress of IFITM3 from the Golgi
  and reveals a regulatory role of IFITM3 on the secretory pathway.
