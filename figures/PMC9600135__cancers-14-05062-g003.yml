caption: Clinical implications of mutations and domain and pathway enrichment analysis.
  (a) Venn plot of database-registered variants. (b) Frequently mutated pfam protein
  domains in CCA. The size of the bubble is in proportion to the number of genes containing
  prominent display domains. (c) Location of TP53 mutations schematic. (d) Location
  of the BCOR mutations schematic. (e) Enrichment of known oncogenic signaling pathways.
  (f) Mutated genes in the RTK-RAS pathway. Tumor suppressor genes are in red, and
  oncogenes are in blue font. The red square represents a patient with one or more
  mutations in this gene and the black dot represents no mutation detected in the
  patient.
