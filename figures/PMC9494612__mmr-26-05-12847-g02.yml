caption: 'Effects of M1 macrophages on the proliferation of liver cancer cells via
  activating the NF-κB pathway. The HepG2 and SNU-183 cells were cultured in CM or
  RM or JSH-23 + CM. (A and B) Following 6 h of treatment with JSH-23, the medium
  was replaced and the cells were cultured for another 4 days. Finally, the cell growth
  of (A) HepG2 and (B) SNU-182 cells was determined by the MTT assay. (C and D) A
  clonogenic assay was utilized to assess the proliferation of liver cancer cells
  (C) representative images of wells with colonies and (D) Quantitative results. All
  experiments were performed in triplicate. ***P<0.001 vs. RM group; #P<0.05, ##P<0.01,
  ###P<0.001 vs. CM group. RM, regular medium; CM, conditioned medium.'
