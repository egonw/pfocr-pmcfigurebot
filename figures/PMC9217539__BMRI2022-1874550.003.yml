caption: 'Rab22a promotes the migration and invasion of thyroid cancer cells. Transwell
  assays showed that Rab22aWT increased the migration and invasion abilities of TPC1
  and K1 cells, and Rab22a knockdown showed the opposite effect (a, 200×). The migration
  ability of TPC1 and K1 cells was assessed by wound healing assays (b, 200×). Statistical
  data were the mean ± SD of the three repeated independent trials: ∗∗∗P < 0.001,
  ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗P < 0.05.'
