caption: Tuberous sclerosis complex 1 deficiency enhanced signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3 signal pathways in lipopolysaccharide-treated macrophages. Classification
  of up-regulated genes and KEGG enriched pathways after TSC1cKO under LPS stimulation
  (A). Network analysis summarized the changes in WT cells stimulated and unstimulated
  by LPS in the previous KEGG enrichment pathway (B). Network analysis of upregulated
  transcription factors in TSC1 knockout macrophages (C). STAT3 signaling pathway
  in WT and TSC1cKO macrophages was analyzed using GSEA tools (D). Isolated primary
  macrophages from WT and TSC1cKO mice were treated with LPS (100 ng/ml) at indicated
  time points. The levels of p-STAT3, p-eIF4 and p-S6 were analyzed by western blot
  (E). Western blot quantification analysis by ImageJ (F). Data are expressed as mean
  ± SEM (n=3 times experiments, Students’ t-test, *p < 0.05, **p <0.01). PI3K-AKT,
  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-protein kinase B; TLR, toll-like receptor; NLR, NOD-like
  Receptor; JAK, Janus kinase; TNF, tumour necrosis factor; p-eIF4E, phosphorylated-eukaryotic
  translation initiation factor 4E; p-S6, phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein; KEGG,
  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TSC1, tuberous
  sclerosis complex 1; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3.
