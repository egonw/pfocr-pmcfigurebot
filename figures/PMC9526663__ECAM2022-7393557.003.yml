caption: 'Protective effect of Ukgansan on dopaminergic neurons in differentiated
  PC12 cells. Dopaminergic neurons were visualized with TH-immunohistochemistry. Representative
  photomicrographs were taken of SNpc and ST (a) Effect of Ukgansan on changes of
  neurotransmitter levels in the striatum. ST was dissociated and lysed to measure
  the dopamine using ELISA kits 7 days after the last MPTP injection (b) Numbers of
  TH-positive neurons in the SNpc were counted or TH protein levels, and the optical
  density and TH protein levels in the ST were measured ((c) and (d)). Values are
  indicated as the mean ± S.E.M. ∗∗∗p < 0.001 compared with the control group, ##p
  < 0.01 and ###p < 0.001 compared with the MPTP-only treated group.'
