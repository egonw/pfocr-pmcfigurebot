caption: MiRNA-190a-5p targets PHLPP1 to regulate the mRNA expression levels of key
  genes on the primordial follicle hyperactivation signaling pathway. (A) LHR, (B)
  AKT1, and (C) FOXO3a mRNA expression during the VCD treating process (D6, D10, D15
  and D45) in rat ovaries tissues were determined by qRT-PCR analysis. Data are summarized
  and presented as mean ± SEM from three independent experiments. ***p＜0.001 vs. control.
