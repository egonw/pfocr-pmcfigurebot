caption: 'Role of calcium store release via IP3R in mediating apoptosis and its regulation
  via PI3K/AKT pathways. (A) (1) G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), Receptor tyrosine
  kinase (RTK) and others, along with cellular stress, can induce PLC, PIP2 and IP3,
  leading to activation of IP3R channels on the ER, promoting Ca2+ store release.
  (3) This mediates Ca2+ transfer to the mitochondria inducing apoptosis. (4) PTEN
  also plays a role in mediating this pathway in part by blocking anti-apoptotic oncogene
  AKT. (B) (1) Activation of oncogenes such as AKT inhibits IP3R Ca2+ release from
  ER stores under chemotherapy and GPCR activation. (2) This is achieved by phosphorylating
  IP3R and (3) reducing Ca2+ transfer to the mitochondria, enabling apoptotic resistance.
  (4) PTEN loss is common in TNBC, enabling AKT signalling. (5) NCS-1 is increased
  in TNBC, promoting IP3R inactivation as well. (6) SOCE is mediated after store release
  via IP3R; channels such as ORAI and TRP that are activated have increased expression
  in TNBC and are linked to promoting EMT and thus chemotherapy resistance. RTK: Receptor
  tyrosine kinase; Orai: calcium release-activated calcium channel protein; PLC: phospholipase
  C; GPCR: G protein-coupled receptors.'
