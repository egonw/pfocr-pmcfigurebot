figure_title: Single-cell RNA and BCR sequencing identifies low clonotype diversity
  and functional deficiency in B cells from the patient with hematologic cancer
caption: (a) The percentage of top 5 clonotypes in each sample. (b) UMAP clustering
  of B cells from COVID infected Heme patient and Non-Heme cancer patient (two timepoints,
  in ICU and after recovery) identified 7 distinct subpopulations. (c) Dotplot of
  selected B cell marker gene expression in each cluster. The size of each circle
  represents proportion of single cells expressing the gene, and the color shade indicates
  normalized expression levels. (d) Cell proportion of each sample in each identified
  cluster. (e) Comparison of expression levels of marker genes in each sample. (f)
  Corresponding canonical pathways regulated by the highly differentially expressed
  genes between Heme patient vs. Non-Heme cancer patient (ICU). Pathway terms are
  ranked by −log 10 (P value). The side listed gene names represent top 6 symbolic
  molecular markers related to the pathway. A statistical quantity, called score,
  is computed and used to characterize the activation level score reflects the predicted
  activation level (z < 0, downregulated; z> 0, upregulated; z ≥ 2 or z ≤ −2 can be
  considered significant). P values were calculated with two-tailed Mann-Whitney test.
  (* P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001, **** P < 0.0001). BCR, B cell repertoires;
  ICU, Intensive Care Unit. UMAP, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection.
