caption: 8p11.22 amplification is associated with PDAC metastasis. A Heatmap illustrating
  the different metastatic sites, genomic alternations, biological pathways and xCell
  signatures of PDAC metastatic patients and non-metastatic patients (Fisher’s exact
  test). B 8p11.22 amplification in PDAC metastatic patients and non-metastatic patients
  (Fisher’s exact test). C The heatmap indicating the cis-effects of ADAM9 and PLEKHA2
  at chromosome locus 8p11.22 (Spearman’s correlation). D The forest plot indicating
  the hazard ratio of ADAM9 and PLEKHA2 in Fudan cohort and CPTAC cohort. E The schematic
  work flow of transwell migration assay to evaluate the role of ADAM9 in promoting
  tumor cell metastasis. F The bar plots indicated the migrated cell counts of PANC-1
  cells under different treatments. G Representative images of migrated PANC-1 cells.
  Scale bar, 50 μm. H Spearman-rank correlation of the abundance of ADAM9 and epithelial
  cell migration (GSVA score) (Spearman’s correlation). I Heatmap of the relative
  abundance of epithelial-cell-migration-related proteins that are significantly associated
  with ADAM9 expression. The fold change of proteins average expression between tumors
  and NATs and the correlation coefficient with ADAM9 are shown on the right. J The
  percent of metastatic patients and non-metastatic patients in high ADAM9/low CDCP1
  and high ADAM9/high CDCP1 groups (Fisher’s exact test). K Spearman-rank correlation
  of the abundance of CDCP1 and SRC (upper). The heatmap on the bottom depicts the
  CDCP1 and SRC protein expression (bottom) (Spearman’s correlation). L Spearman-rank
  correlation of the abundance of SRC and WNT signaling pathway (GSVA score). M Flow
  chart for identification of SRC substrates that are significantly positively correlated
  with SRC expression. N Heatmap of the relative abundance of WNT-signaling-related
  proteins that are significantly associated with SRC expression (left). Spearman’s
  correlation is showed on the right. O The protein–protein interaction networks describing
  the interactions between ADAM9 and proteins involved in tumor microenvironment and
  between CDCP1 and proteins enriched in WNT signaling pathway. P Representative immunohistochemical
  staining pattern for ADAM9 and CDCP1 proteins on three tumor samples of metastatic
  patients. Q Representative immunohistochemical staining pattern for ADAM9 and CDCP1
  proteins on two tumor samples of non-metastatic patients. ****p < 1.0E−4, ***p < 1.0E−3,
