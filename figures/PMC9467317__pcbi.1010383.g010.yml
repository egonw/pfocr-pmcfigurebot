caption: The rows list the proteins, which were knocked out, and the columns give
  the protein complexes in the network, which could be affected by the knockout. A
  red (gray) entry indicates that the respective complex was (was not) affected. We
  performed a single knockout analysis for twenty proteins and displayed the effect
  for a part of 21 pathway entities. The last two rows represent multiple knockouts
  and display the effect of SMAC mimetic, i.e., the knockout of XIAP and cIAP, and
  the impairment of the translation of upregulated genes by cycloheximide, i.e., the
  knockout of IÎºB, A20, XIAP, cFLIPL, and BCL-2.
