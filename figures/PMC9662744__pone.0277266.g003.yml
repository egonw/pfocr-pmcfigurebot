caption: '(a-n): Examples of expression of GHR, STAT5, IGF-1, Snail-1 and TGFBR2 in
  a variety of stromal cells of TME in HCC and cirrhotic patients. GHR: growth hormone
  receptor, STAT5: signal transducer and activator of transcription5; IGF-1: insulin
  like growth factor-1; TGFBR2: type 2 transforming growth factor-beta receptor; TME:
  tumor microenvironment; HCC: hepatocellular carcinoma. *: Images are presented at
  20X magnification power with 200X zoom in boxes.'
