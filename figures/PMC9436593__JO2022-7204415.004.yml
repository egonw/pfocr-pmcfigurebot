caption: Differences in expression, prognosis, and biological pathway correlation
  of risk model genes associated with membrane lipid biosynthesis in pan-cancer. (a)â€“(b)
  Heatmaps showing differential mRNA expression of these membrane lipid biosynthesis-related
  risk model genes in pan-cancer and their correlation with biological pathways. (c)
  Heat map showing DFI, DSS, OS, and PFS of these membrane lipid biosynthesis-related
  risk model genes in pan-cancer. (d, e) These show how the GSVA scores of these membrane
  lipid biosynthesis-related risk model genes differ in pan-cancer and their correlation
  with biological pathways. The red represents the activated biological pathway, and
  the blue represents the inhibited biological pathway.
