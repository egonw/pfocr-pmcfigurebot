caption: GO functional enrichment analyses of genes in the candidate modules suggest
  specific roles in epithelial cell migration, extracellular matrix organization,
  cell–cell junction, DNA replication processes and stress response. GO term and KEGG
  pathway enrichment analysis results for (A) Brown, (B) Darkmagenta and (C) Antiquewhite4
  modules. The bar plot depicts the biological process (BP), molecular function (MF)
  and respective cellular component (CC) of the GO terms (up). The bubble plot illustrates
  the most significant and top KEGG pathways (down). The y‐axis shows the GO and KEGG
  pathway terms and the number of genes on the x‐axis. The region of bars and bubbles
  is significantly proportional to the number of genes in a given GO term or KEGG
  pathway. The adjusted p‐value of each term is coloured according to the legend
