caption: 'Identification of DEGs between ASD and CON and DEGs functional enrichment
  analysis. (A) Volcano diagram: Each point represents a protein: downregulated (blue),
  upregulated (red), and not significant (yellow). (B) A heatmap of the expression
  of DEGs in ASD and CON. (C) TOP-6 GSEA analysis of the KEGG pathway in DEGs. (D)
  Statistically significant Gene Ontology terms with a false discovery rate of <0.05.
  (E) The canonical pathway of IPA shows the signaling pathways in which DEGs are
  involved.'
