caption: Irradiation treatment significantly inhibits the proliferation and reduces
  the expression of ACY1 in cetuximab-resistant CRC cells. (A) The sensitivity of
  a panel of the CRC cell line HCT116 and the cetuximab-resistant CRC cell line HCT116-R
  to cetuximab was assessed by CCK8 assays. CRC cells were incubated with graded concentrations
  (0–20 μg/mL) of cetuximab for 24 h and 48 h. (B) A colony formation assay was performed
  in HCT116-R cells after exposure to graded doses of irradiation (0, 4, and 6 Gy).
  The surviving fraction of HCT116-R cells was determined at least three times, and
  the data are presented as the mean ± SD. (C) The heatmap from the hierarchical clustering
  of 35 mRNA expression patterns in HCT116-R cells treated with 0, 4, and 6 Gy irradiation
  is shown. (D) The expression of ACY1 was examined by qRT-PCR in HCT116 and HCT116-R
  cells treated with 0, 4, and 6 Gy irradiation. The experiment was repeated at least
  three times, and the data are presented as the mean ± SD. (E) The expression of
  ACY1 in HCT116 and HCT116-R cells treated with 0, 4, and 6 Gy irradiation was examined
  by Western blotting. The experiment was repeated at least three times, and the data
  are presented as the mean ± SD. ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001.
