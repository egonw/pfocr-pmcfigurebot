caption: Interaction network of metabonomic profiles, the gut microbiota, and the
  indirect pathway of the gut–liver axis in moxifloxacin–induced hepatotoxicity. Oxidative
  phosphorylation, lipid metabolism, and butanoate metabolism are the main metabolic
  pathways affected by moxifloxacin. The variations of gut flora, represented by a
  heightened abundance of Muribaculaceae and the decline abundance of Lachnospiraceae,
  led to the observed changes in intestinal metabolic function. Muribaculaceae and
  Lachnospiraceae participate in the reduction of butyric acid production and alteration
  in lipid metabolism could be closely related to the pathophysiological changes of
  liver function.
