caption: The effect of the holdase function of Hsp90/70 on IDP aggregation.A, native
  conformation of the IDP monomer (tau shown) with hydrophobic regions shielded. B,
  nonnative monomeric conformation that exposes the hydrophobic regions. C, Hsp90/70
  canonical binding interface, which interacts with structured foldase clients, and
  noncanonical binding interface, which interacts with the non-native IDP monomer
  through the holdase pathway. D, oligomeric species formed through the self-association
  of the exposed hydrophobic regions. E, aggregate (cellular inclusion, aggregate,
  or fibril formation) formation. F, degradation of the bound IDP. G, non-native monomeric
  IDPs liberated from the aggregates by the disaggregase machinery. Image created
  with BioRender.com. Hsp70, heat shock protein 70 kDa; Hsp90, heat shock protein
  90 kDa; IDP, intrinsically disordered protein.
