figure_title: Pathways and functional categories enriched in differentially expressed
  genes induced by VILMIR knockdown after IFN-β treatment in A549 cells
caption: A-B) QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was performed to identify canonical
  pathways significantly enriched in the differentially expressed (DE) genes impacted
  by VILMIR KD after 1 ng/mL or 10 ng/mL IFN-β treatment in A549 cells. Enriched pathways
  shared between the IFN-β treatments are bolded. Panel B represents the top 17 out
  of 29 pathways. C-D) In addition, diseases and biological functions categories significantly
  enriched in the DE genes were identified for both IFN-β treatments using IPA (cancer
  categories excluded). Enriched pathways and functional categories that met the raw
  enrichment p-value < 0.05 (−log10 p-value cutoff of 1.3) using a right-tailed Fisher9s
  Exact Test in both VILMIR KD lines and were associated with a canonical pathway
  or function and/or disease in the QIAGEN Knowledge Base were included here (*P <
  0.05 included as reference). For visualization, a −log10 p-value cutoff of 9.2 was
  applied to the x-axis of the bar plot in Panel D. Plots in B-D represent the subset
  of top enriched pathways and functional categories and the full lists are available
  in Tables S3-S6.
