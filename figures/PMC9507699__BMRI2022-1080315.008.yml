caption: 'TGF-β1 signaling pathway participates in the role of HOXB9 in HCC cells.
  (a) MTT assay was used to analyze the cell proliferation of BEL-7405 cells, treated
  with pBabe, pBabe-HOXB9, or pBabe-HOXB9 and specific TGF-β1 inhibitor LY364947.
  (b–c) Cell cycle analysis of BEL-7405 cells treated with pBabe, pBabe-HOXB9, or
  pBabe-HOXB9 and LY364947. (d–e) Transwell assay was used to show the migrative and
  invasive ability of BEL-7405 cells treated with pBabe, pBabe-HOXB9, or pBabe-HOXB9
  and LY364947. (f) Immunofluorescence was performed to evaluate the effect of HOXB9
  and LY364947 on p-Smad2 expression in nucleus of BEL-7405 cells. ∗P < 0.05 vs. pBabe;
  #P < 0.05 vs. HOXB9.'
