caption: Exosomes deliver thalidomide and si-SALL4-B to target SALL4 for inhibiting
  angiogenesis. A SALL4-B, VEGF-A, B, and C expression levels were detected in MGC-803
  cells treated with engineered exosomes (EX-293T, EX-THAL, EX-si-SALL4-B, and EX-THAL + si-SALL4-B)
  by using real-time RT-PCR. B SALL4-B, VEGF-A, B, and C expression was detected by
  using a western blot in MGC-803 cells treated with engineered exosomes. C ELISA
  assay was used to measure VEGF-A, B, and C expression levels in the conditioned
  medium from MGC-803 cells treated with engineered exosomes. HUVEC cells were incubated
  with the conditioned medium from engineered exosomes-treated MGC-803 cells. The
  proliferation, migration, and angiogenic abilities of HUVEC cells were analyzed
  by using the CCK-8 assay (D), transwell assay (E), and tube formation assay (F).
  The results are presented as the means ± standard error of mean (SEM). **P < 0.01,
  *** P < 0.001
