caption: GINS2 promotes HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by regulating
  the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. A. Correlation between HALLMARK_PI3K_AKT_MTOR_SIGNALING
  and GINS2 in LIHC according to data from the TCGA database. B. Correlation between
  HALLMARK_PI3K_AKT_MTOR_SIGNALING and GINS2 in pan-cancers according to data from
  the TCGA database. C. Expression levels of PI3K/p-PI3K (Tyr458), AKT/p-AKT (Ser473),
  and mTOR/p-mTOR (Ser2448) in 97H and LM3 cells transfected with sh-NC or sh-GINS2
  were examined by western blot. D. HUH7 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1-GINS2
  were treated with or without the indicated concentrations of Ly294002. Expression
  levels of PI3K/p-PI3K (Tyr458), AKT/p-AKT (Ser473), and mTOR/p-mTOR (Ser2448) were
  examined by western blot. E. The model of the E2F1/GINS2 axis mediating aggressive
  behaviors in HCC through activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
