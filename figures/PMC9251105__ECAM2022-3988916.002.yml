caption: YWHAG gene knockdown (KD) inhibits proliferation, invasion, and migration
  of cervical cancer. PCR assay used to detect YWHAG knockdown (KD) in HeLa and C33A
  (a). CCK-8 detected the proliferation of HeLa (b) and C33A (c). The invasiveness
  of HeLa (d) and C33A (e) detected by transwell assay. qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time
  PCR. ∗∗P < 0.01. Scale = 200 μm.
