caption: '‘Signature Protein’ section. (A) Phosprof top page. Proteins with significant
  change in phosphorylation level can be browsed by choosing the tested cell type
  (MCF7 or K562) and treated drug. (B) Signature proteins are highlighted on a pathway
  map. The 376 analyzed pathways were divided into four functional groups (g1: RTK
  pathway; g2: Wnt–Hh pathway; g3: GPCR pathway and g4: Cell Death pathway), according
  to the Reactome classification. (C) Signature proteins of K562 cells under treatment
  with the SRC inhibitor bosutinib. Data type (Std: standardized data or Raw: raw
  data), analysis type (RP: rank products or Pearson) and thresholds (Top 50/100/150/200
  or P-value) can be selected. (D) Enlarged view after searching for SRC on the pathway
  map. (E) The nodes of the pathway map are linked to the ‘details of the protein’
  page. Detailed information includes the gene symbols, amino acid sequences and the
  disorder scores. This page is also connected to the PDB web site and the protein
  tertiary structures.'
