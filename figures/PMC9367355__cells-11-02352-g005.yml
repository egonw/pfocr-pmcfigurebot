caption: The tumor microenvironment influences the activation of stemness regulatory
  lncRNAs in gastric cancer. LncRNAs, such as LINC01559, can be secreted by cells
  in the microenvironment via exosomes. LINC01559 enters cancer cells and activates
  the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. There, it acts as a sponge for miR-1343-3p, allowing
  the translation of PGK1 kinase mRNA and activating the signaling pathway. In addition,
  this lncRNA acts as a signal to recruit chromatin remodeling complexes to the PTEN
  promoter region, preventing its expression. This allows the signaling system to
  be activated and the cancer cells to acquire capacities associated with the stem
  phenotype.
