caption: Influence of LINC00460 on RCC cells apoptosis and EMT phenotype. (A, B) Cell
  apoptosis was determined using flow cytometry analysis after LINC00460 overexpression
  in RCC cell lines (** p<0.01). (C, D) Cell apoptosis markers were detected by Western
  blot analysis when silenced LINC00460 was transfected in RCC cells. Data statistics
  was also shown (GAPDH as negative control, *p < 0.05, *** p<0.001).
