caption: PANTHER Overrepresentation Analysis of the signaling pathways of the DEGs
  shared by cep290 and bbs2 mutants with a |log2 > 0.5| fold change in expression.
  (A) The DEGs shared between mutant retinas had an overabundance of genes in inflammatory
  and stress response signaling pathways. Genes of the apoptosis, PDGF, and gonadotropin-releasing
  hormone receptor pathway were also overrepresented. (B) The DEGs from the apoptosis
  signaling pathway were upregulated. (C) Genes of the platelet derived growth factor
  (PDGF) signaling pathway include the Stat transcription factors and were largely
  upregulated. The transcription factor nin was downregulated. (D) Genes of the gonadotropin-releasing
  hormone receptor pathway were largely upregulated and include stat3. Three transcription
  factors were downregulated.
