caption: 'cGAS/STING via type I IFN axis supports the neutrophilic inflammation. Natterin
  (1 μg) diluted in PBS was i.p. injected into BL6 WT (WT_Natterin) or in ifnar-,
  il-28r-, or ifnγr-deficient mice (A), or in cgas-, sting- or irf3-deficient mice
  (KO_Natterin groups) (B). Two hours after Natterin injection, mice were killed and
  the peritoneal cavities were washed to obtain exudates. Peritoneal exudate cells
  were harvested and the number of neutrophils related to total cell number was evaluated
  in cytospin slides stained with the Diff-Quick staining kit. Examples of representative
  photomicrographs are shown in (C). Each bar represents the mean ± SEM of 3–5 animals/group.
  * p < 0.05 compared with WT_PBS group and # p < 0.05 compared with WT_Natterin-group.'
