caption: Loss of Ly6D confers chemosensitivity of LSCC cells. (A, B) The protein and
  mRNA levels of Ly6D were determined by western blot (A) and qPCR analysis (B) in
  indicated cells which were stably depleted of Ly6D. (C, D) Tu686 (C) and CAL27 cells
  (D) were stably expressing non-targeting shRNA (shcont) or shRNA against Ly6D (shLy6D-1
  and shLy6D-2) and treated with various concentrations of chemotherapy drugs for
  24 h. Then, the relative cell survival was detected by CCK8. (E) Tu686 cells with
  stable knockdown of Ly6D were treated with cisplatin (20 μM) for 24 h and subsequently
  evaluated by EdU assay. (F) Colony formation assay was performed for Tu686 cells
  with stable knockdown of Ly6D and cisplatin (20 μM) treatment.
