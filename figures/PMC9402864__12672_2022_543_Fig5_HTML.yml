caption: Inducible silencing of HMMR abrogates peritoneal implantation of gastric
  cancer. A Immunoblot analysis of HMMR and critical genes of AKT/FOXO1 signaling
  pathway (p-AKT, AKT, p-FOXO1, FOXO1, BAX, BAD) were performed in indicated groups.
  B The percent of anoikis cells in indicated groups were shown. C Representative
  images of cell clustering formations in indicated groups were shown. D Scheme of
  Dox induced mouse model. Dox-induced silencing of HMMR was performed the day after
  i.p inoculation. E Bloody ascites were observed 6 weeks after i.p inoculation. F Mice
  were sacrificed to examine the peritoneal dissemination 6 weeks after i.p inoculation.
  The number of tumor nodules were quantified. Each bar represents the mean ± SD of
  three independent experiments. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
