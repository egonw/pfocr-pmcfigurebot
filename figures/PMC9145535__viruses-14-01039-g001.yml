caption: Experimental workflow for the study. (A) Outlining the signaling pathway
  luciferase reporter screen. The names of signaling pathways tested in this study
  are shown. (B) Immunoblot analysis of the expression of C-terminally 2xStrep-tagged
  SARS-CoV-2 proteins in transfected 293T cells using Strep-tag antibody. The red
  arrowheads indicate the viral proteins on the immunoblots. Viral proteins that are
  not expressed are indicated by an asterisk.
