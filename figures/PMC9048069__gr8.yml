caption: BTC attenuates apoptosisinduction(A) PC9 cells expressing non-specific (NS)
  or BTC shRNAs were analyzed for cleaved caspase three using immunoblotting analysis.
  ACTB was used as a loading control.(B) HCC2935 cells expressing NS or BTC shRNAs
  were analyzed for cleaved caspase three using immunoblotting analysis. ACTB was
  used as a loading control.(C) HSAEC1-KT cells expressing vector or the V5-tagged
  BTC ORF were analyzed for cleaved caspase three using immunoblotting analysis. ACTB
  was used as a loading control.(D) PC9 and HCC2935 cells expressing NS or BTC shRNAs
  were analyzed for annexin V-positive cells. Representative micrographs are shown.
  Scale bar, 200 μm.(E) Quantitation of the annexin V-positive cells under the indicated
  conditions for the experiment shown in panel (D).(F) Model showing the mechanism
  of BTC action in EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma. Data are shown as the mean ±SEM
  ∗∗∗p<0.001, ∗∗∗∗p<0.0001.
