caption: A hypothetical mechanism of the antileukemic effects of 5-demethyl NOB in
  human AML cells. 5-Demethyl NOB inhibits leukemia cell proliferation through the
  regulation of cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, cell differentiation, cell growth, and
  the NF-κB/TNF-α-mediated inflammatory response. 5-Demethyl NOB regulates cell proliferation
  through a substantial reduction in ID1 expression in AML cells. Cytarabine combined
  with 5-demethyl NOB showed a synergistic effect on the reduction of cell viability
  in AML cells.
