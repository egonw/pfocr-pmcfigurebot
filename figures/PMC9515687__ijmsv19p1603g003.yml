caption: A two-step mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The priming is triggered
  by the activation of cytokines or PAMPs, such as LPS and IL-1β, leading to the transcriptional
  upregulation of NLRP3 inflammasome components, including NLRP3, pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18,
  caspase 1, and the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway. Post-translational modifications
  (PTMs) in the priming signal maintain NLRP3 in an auto-suppressed inactive conformation
  before stimulation. The self-oligomerization of NLRP3 occurs and the downstream
  recruitment of ASC is achieved by PYD-PYD interaction. Subsequently, aggregated
  ASC recruits pro-caspase-1, resulting in the activation of caspase-1. IL-1β, IL-18,
  and GSDMD can be activated by activated caspase-1. Then, caspase-1 cleaves GSDMD
  to liberate gasdermin D N-terminal form (GSDMD N). The GSDMD N can form membrane
  pores to mediate the nonconventional release of IL-1β and IL-18 and triggers pyroptosis.
