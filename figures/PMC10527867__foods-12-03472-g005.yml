caption: Metabolic pathway enrichment analysis based on the differential metabolites
  identified between viable but nonculturable (VBNC) and recovered Lacticaseibacillus
  paracasei Zhang cells. The size and color of the circles represent the number of
  differential metabolites in the specifically enriched pathway and its extent of
  statistical significance, respectively. A darker circle represents a greater magnitude
  of significant difference.
