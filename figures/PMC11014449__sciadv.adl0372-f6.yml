  functions
caption: '(A) Circular heatmap displaying differentially expressed genes related to
  cell senescence, inflammation, glycolysis, TCA cycle, and OXPHOS, in fibroblasts
  from aged skin tissues treated with PBS, EV, and Met-EV. (B) PCA of genes in PBS,
  EV, and Met-EV–treated fibroblast groups. (C) Volcano plots analysis showed that
  40,660 genes were detected, and 7457 genes were identified as differentially expressed
  genes between PBS and Met-EV groups (absolute log2 fold changes > 1 and P values
  < 0.05). (D) GSEA was performed to contrast the gene sets associated with glycolysis
  and OXPHOS between PBS and Met-EV groups. (E) Differentially expressed enzymes involved
  in TCA cycle among PBS, EV, and Met-EV groups. (F) Heatmap of differentially detected
  metabolites in fibroblasts from aged skin tissues treated with PBS, EV, and Met-EV.
  (G) Pathway analysis for the effect of Met-EV on skin tissues compared with PBS
  using MetaboAnalyst. (H and I) OCR detection with a Cell Mito Stress Test Kit from
  Agilent, with ATP production, basal respiration, maximal respiration, and spare
  respiratory analyzed. (J) Representative images of normal and senescent fibroblasts
  incubated with EV and Met-EV, stained with MitoTracker Red for mitochondria visualization
  (scale bar: 10 μm). (K) Representative TEM images of mitochondria in fibroblasts
  treated with different stimulus (scale bar: 500 nm). (L and N) JC-1 aggregates (red)
  and monomers (green) staining in fibroblasts for detecting mitochondria membrane
  potential (scale bar: 25 μm) and fluorescence quantitative analysis. (M and O) MitoGreen
  for mitochondria tracker and MitoSOX for mtROS detection (scale bar: 30 μm) and
  fluorescence quantitative analysis. (P) Schematic diagram of Met-EV–mediated metabolic
  reprogramming in senescent fibroblasts. n = 3 was analyzed and shown here.'
