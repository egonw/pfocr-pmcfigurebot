figure_title: Inhibition of TOPK attenuates the anchorage-independent growth and promotes
  the apoptosis of H2228 cells
caption: A Growth curve analysis was used to detect the proliferation rate of the
  stable shMock and shTOPK H2228 cells. Upper panel showed verification of the cell
  lines identified by western blotting. ***P < 0.001. B Knockdown of TOPK reduced
  tumorigenic properties of H2228 cells ex vivo. Representative photomicrographs of
  colony formation in soft agar of shMock cells compared with shTOPK#1 or shTOPK#3
  cells were shown. Data are represented as mean ± standard deviation from triplicate
  experiments. ***P < 0.001. C, D The stable shMock and shTOPK#1 H2228 cells were
  treated with alectinib (0.1 μΜ) for 24 h. Total and cleaved PARP were detected by
  western blotting analysis (C). Dead cells were detected by Annexin V-FITC and PI
  double staining and analyzed by flow cytometry (D). Data are represented as mean ± standard
  deviation from triplicate experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
