caption: Schematic representation of a putative signaling pathway via which κ-OR activation
  triggers autophagy resulting in synaptic alterations. Activation of κ-ΟR in neuronal
  cells leads to ERK1,2 phosphorylation mediated by Gi/ο proteins. Αctivated ERK1,2
  subsequently phosphorylates CREB which in turn translocates to the nucleus to activate
  Becn1 gene expression. Upregulation of Beclin1 and Atg5 promotes the initiation
  of autophagy resulting in alterations of hippocampal synaptic proteins enriched
  in dendritic spines.
