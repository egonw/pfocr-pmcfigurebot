caption: 'BIRC5 pathway enrichment, target gene expression, and target gene ontology.
  (a) Volcano plots of the genes with BIRC5 expression that are negatively and positively
  correlated. Genes that were negatively associated with BIRC5 expression are represented
  by the green section of the volcano curve, whereas positively correlated genes are
  shown by the red section of the curve (accessed on LinkedOmics:: Volcano Plot).
  GSEA GO (b) genes that co-express BIRC5 in a biological process. Blue bars show
  pathways that are highly enriched in positively linked genes, with dark blue bars
  denoting pathways with FDR < 0.05 and light blue bars representing pathways with
  FDR > 0.05. Orange bars show routes that are more likely to contain genes that are
  inversely correlated, with light orange bars showing pathways with FDR > 0.05. Inversely
  associated genes were overrepresented in the topmost significant pathways, as demonstrated
  by the enrichment plots in (c–k). (g) GSEA KEGG for BIRC5 and co-expressed genes
  KEGG database enrichment plots. (l–r) show the topmost significant pathways that
  are over-represented among negatively correlated genes, www.linkedomics.org/lo_batchfile/qindex_gsea.php?fn=120514
