caption: 'TRIAP1 depletion activates a p53-related stress response. (A) Transcriptomics
  analysis of HCT116 cells transduced with control (ctrl#1, #2) and TRIAP1 (TRIAP1
  #1, #2, #3) shRNAs. Heat map and hierarchical clustering based on genes that are
  differentially expressed between TRIAP1-depleted (shRNA TRIAP1 #1, #2, #3) and control
  (shRNA Ctrl #1, #2) cells analyzed by RNA-seq, 6 days post transduction (adjusted
  p value < 0.05). Genes are listed by row and analyzed samples by column. The color
  intensity represents the Z score, where green corresponds to upregulated and red
  downregulated expression. (B) Top enriched biological processes (top panel). The
  differentially expressed genes were analyzed for Gene Ontology (GO) using the “ToppGene
  Suite” (). The top GO terms for biological processes are represented with a bar
  plot with most significant p-values (Adj. p value <0.07). Top enriched signaling
  and functional pathways (bottom panel). Significantly enriched pathway term analysis
  for differentially expressed genes in relation to TRIAP1 depletion was carried out
  using the online PANTHER website (). (C) mRNA expression analyses of several P53
  target genes identified as differentially expressed during transcriptomics studies
  performed in (A) qPCR studies were realized for the indicated mRNA. Relative expression
  fold variation was calculated for TRIAP1-depleted cells (shRNA TRIAP1 #1, #2, #3)
  compared with control (shRNA Ctrl) cells, using the comparative Ct method (after
  normalization against actin mRNA). Data represent mean ± SEM of three experiments.
  Kruskal–Wallis tests were used for statistical comparisons. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01;
  ***p < 0.001; ns, non significant. (D) Immunoblot analysis of extracts of HCT116
  cells transduced with lentiviral control (Ctrl) and TRIAP1 (TRIAP1 #1, #2, #3) shRNAs
  and grown in standard growth conditions. Actin was used as a loading control.'
