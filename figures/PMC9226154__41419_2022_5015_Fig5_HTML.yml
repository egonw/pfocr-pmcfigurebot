figure_title: ASNS promotes β-catenin accumulation and translocation into nucleus
caption: A Cell components of cytosol and nucleus were segregated by the Nuclear and
  Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents. Lamin b1, a marker of nuclear component, α-tubulin,
  a marker of cytosolic component; levels of nuclear β-catenin were normalized to
  Laminb1, and levels of cytosolic β-catenin were normalized to Tubulin. Wnt 3a was
  a special activator for Wnt pathway and was always used to drive Wnt cascade in
  vitro. The whole-cell β-catenin accumulation was detected by western blot when wnt3a
  treated in cell lines of H1299 (B), 95D (C), 95C (E), and A549 (F). All levels of
  β-catenin in gradient time after wnt3a treatment were normalized to initial levels
  of β-catenin (0 min). Furthermore, the translocation of β-catenin into nucleus was
  detected by western blot (D) and immunofluorescence (G). The different protein levels
  between groups were tested by Student’s t test. Error bars were expressed as mean ± S.D.
  P < 0.05 is significant statistic difference, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
  Representative images from three independent experiments are shown.
