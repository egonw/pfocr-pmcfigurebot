caption: Licoricidin promoted MGC-803 cell apoptosis and arrested mitosis in the G0/G1
  phase. MGC-803 cells were treated with licoricidin (5, 10, and 20 μM) or 5-fluorouracil
  20 μM for 24 h. (A) Apoptosis of MGC-803 cells was detected by flow cytometry after
  Annexin Ⅴ-FITC/PI dual staining, and the percentage rate of apoptotic cells was
  displayed in the histogram. (B) Morphological changes of MGC-803 cells were observed
  by Giemsa dye liquor (×200). Compared with the untreated group, cells treated with
  20 μM of licoricidin presented a different morphology, and particularly, typical
  manifestations of apoptotic cells, such as nuclear pyknosis, hyperchromasia, and
  apoptotic bodies, can be seen. (C) Expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins
  (Bcl-2, Bax, Cyt-C, and Caspase 3) were assessed by Western blot assay and normalized
  by reference genes for quantitative analysis. (D) Licoricidin arrested the cell
  cycle in the G0/G1 phase. Flow cytometry was carried out to measure DNA content
  and cell cycle distribution after the cells were fixed by PI staining, and the results
  were analyzed by ModfitLT 5.0 software. (E) Expression levels of cyclin D1 and CDK4
  were assessed by Western blot analysis and normalized by β-tubulin for quantitative
  analysis. Results are displayed as mean ± SD of three independent experiments. *p
  < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001. LCD, licoricidin. 5-FU, 5-fluorouracil.
  Scale bar, 100 μm.
