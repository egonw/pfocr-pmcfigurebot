caption: Molecular mechanism diagram illustrating the transfer of miR-146a-5p via
  cervical cancer cells-secreted EVs to promote the metastasis of cervical cancer.
  EVs secreted by high-metastatic cervical cancer cells carrying miR-146a-5p can be
  internalized by low-metastatic cervical cancer cells, and then miR-146a-5p inhibited
  WWC2 expression to promote dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of YAP. Consequently,
  YAP promoted the activity of actin depolymerization factor cofilin by inhibiting
  its phosphorylation, thereby changing the dynamics of F-actin/G-actin and leading
  to metastasis of low-metastatic cervical cancer cells.
