caption: Efflux capacity of BRAFV600E mutant MaMel cells. A Representative scatter
  plots of the side population (SP) assay detecting the efflux of DyeCycle Violet
  stain (DCV) in MaMel cells. The polygonal gates indicate the SP subsets (DCV-) for
  each cell line. B Quantification of the percentage of SP cells. C Heatmap displaying
  the normalized expression (z-score) of genes encoding for ABC transporter family
  members. D Representative scatter plots of the SP assay for MaMel21 after inhibition
  of ABC transporters with verapamil, Ko143, or the combination, in comparison to
  DMSO control. The polygonal gates indicate the SP subsets for each condition. E
  Quantification of the percentage of SP cells. All bar plots show the mean ± SD of
  three independent experiments (n = 3). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ****p < 0.0001
