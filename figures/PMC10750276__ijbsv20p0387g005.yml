caption: KLF7 positively regulates the expression of PDGFB. (A) Correlation between
  KLF7 and PDGFB expression in the GEPIA database. (B) PDGFB mRNA expression in 30
  paired COAD samples (n = 30). (C) Spearson's correlation analysis of KLF7 and PDGFB
  mRNA expression ratio (tumor/peri-tumor) in COAD patients (n = 30). Spearson's correlation
  coefficient (r) and P-values are shown. (D) ELISA in transient KLF7-overexpressing
  SW620 cells orKLF7-knockdown LoVo cells cultured at low serum condition (n = 3).
  (E) Seven KLF7-binding sites on the PDGFB promoter were predicted via Jaspar. R
  indicates the potential binding region. (F) The constructs with different predicted
  KLF7 were generated (left), and the activity of the PDGFB promoter was determined
  by a dual-luciferase reporter assay (right) (n = 3). (G) Dual-Luciferase Reporter
  Assay using PDGFB promoter construct (-207~+1) with R1, R3, or R6 deletion (âˆ†) in
  SW620 cells (n = 3). (H, I) The ChIP assay was conducted by immunoprecipitating
  DNA with either anti-IgG or anti-HA antibody in SW620-KLF7 cells, followed by qPCR
  (H) and PCR(I) amplification using specific primers of PDGFB promoter region -207~+1
  (n = 3). ns, not significant, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001.
