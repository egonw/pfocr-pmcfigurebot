caption: Pathway analysis plot of altered metabolic pathways after acute stress. Dots
  represent metabolic pathways altered after 24 h of major stress. The Y-axis represents
  the logarithm transformed P-value adjusted for multiple comparisons. The X-axis
  represents the pathway impact, calculated by overrepresentation of metabolites from
  the same pathway, as well as highly important metabolites to the pathway. The pathways
  that were most associated with stress are a combination of high pathway impact and
  -log10 (Adj P-value)  1.1220, which is equivalent to a P-value < 0.05 (the top right
  corner of the graph). Colour represents significance, from White (not significant)
  to Red (significant), and larger dot size represents a higher impact score. The
  figure was created by the online tool MetaboAnalyst 5.0 (www.metaboanalyst.ca/MetaboAnalyst/).
