caption: 'Effects of axial ligands on CPT1A activity. (A) Structures of Platinum(IV)
  prodrugs with variation at the axial ligands for understanding the role of these
  ligands in CPT1A binding. Schematic representation of (B) Platin-L binding to CPT1A
  due to the long-chain fatty acid, compared to Platin-4 which does not bind due to
  the short-chain fatty acid and (C) Platin-L binding to CPT1A due to its ability
  to interact with acyl-CoA synthase to become Platin-L-Acyl-CoA and interact with
  CPT1A compared to Platin-L-4, which does not have the ability to convert to an acyl-CoA
  form. (D) Incorporation of fluorescent, long-chain fatty acid BODIPY-palmitate into
  PC3 cells after treatment with various compounds using live cell imaging. (E) Immunoprecipitation
  (IP) of CPT1A to quantify the amount of Platinum present on CPT1A after treatment
  of PC3 cells with Platin-4, Platin-L-4, or Platin-L. The data presented here is
  an average with the standard deviation from three independent biological replicates
  (N = 3). (F) Schematic representation of the CPT1A activity assay. Top: normal conditions
  for CPT1A function, resulting in the release of CoA-SH into the cytosol. Bottom:
  inhibitory conditions, where CPT1A is inhibited and CoA-SH is not released into
  the cytosol. The amount of CoA-SH released can be directly correlated to the activity
  of CPT1A. (G) Relative activity of CPT1A after treatment with test articles at 10
  Î¼M. The data presented here is an average with the standard deviation from four
  independent biological replicates (N = 4), each with three technical replicates
  (n = 3). Ordinary one-way ANOVA was used to calculate the significance. (H) Western
  blot analyses of the subcellular fractions used for Pt quantification to ensure
  purity. (I) Platinum content in subcellular fractions by ICP-MS. The data presented
  is the mean with the standard deviation from two independent biological replicates.
  Ordinary one-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons was used to calculate the significance.'
