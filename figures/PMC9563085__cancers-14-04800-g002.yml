caption: Mechanisms of action of antibodies in cancer. Antibodies can use several
  mechanisms to suppress (1–4) or promote (5–7) tumor growth. (1) Certain subclasses
  of antibodies can mediate tumor cell killing by ADCC mediated by NK cells, ADCP
  by macrophages, trogoptosis by neutrophils, and CDC. (2) Capture of antibody/antigen
  complex by DC can prime anti-tumor immunity through antigen cross-presentation to
  CD8+ T cells. (3) Transcytosis of dimeric IgA in tumor cells increases their sensitivity
  to CD8+ T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. (4) Direct modulation of target antigen function
  leading to tumor cell dysfunction/elimination. (5) Modulation of tumor antigens
  leading to survival/proliferation of tumor cells. (6) IgG4, scIgG1, and IgA can
  suppress the effector functions of cytotoxic antibody isotypes. IgG4 compete with
  IgG1 for FcγR binding. ScIgG1 has a reduced ability to induce ADCC compared to IgG1.
  IgA inhibits NK-dependent ADCC mediated by IgG1/IgG3. (7) IgG-antigen immune complexes
  can induce tumor-promoting inflammation by stimulation of macrophages and mast cells
  and/or by the activation of the classical complement pathway and the release of
  pro-inflammatory anaphylatoxins.
