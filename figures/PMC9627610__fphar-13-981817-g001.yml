caption: CBD inhibits collagen transcription and synthesis in vitro without altering
  SMAD2 pathway. (A) Col1a2 transcriptional activity in NIH-3T3 cells pretreated with
  CBD for 1 h and stimulated with TGFβ1 for the following 24 h (n = 4) (B) Effect
  of CBD pretreatment on soluble collagen release by human dermal fibroblast using
  the Sircol Assay. Fibroblasts were pretreated with CBD for 1 h and stimulated with
  TGFβ1 for 48 h and collagen was measured in the culture media (n = 3). (C) Effect
  of CBD on SMAD-dependent transcriptional activity. NIH-3T3 cells were transfected
  with the CAGA-Luc plasmid, preincubated with the indicated concentrations of CBD
  for 1 h and stimulated with TGFβ1 (10 ng/ml) for 6 h. Then, cells were lysed for
  luciferase activity (n = 3). Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. relative to control
  cells. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001 vs TGFβ1-treated cells. (D) CBD effect
  on SMAD2 phosphorylation. NHDF cells were incubated in low serum conditions (1%
  FBS) for 24 h. Then cells were pretreated with CBD or Rosiglitazone (RGZ) for 1 h
  and stimulated with TGFβ 1 (10 ng/ml) for 2 h. (E) Viability of NIH3T3 cells treated
  with different concentrations of CBD after 24 h expressed as percentage taking control
  as 100% (n = 3). (F) Effect of CBD treatment on Col1a2 transcriptional activity
  in NIH-3T3 cells (n = 3).
