caption: Multiomics‐analyzed transcriptome and 3D genome of steady state T cells and
  G‐CSF‐administrated hyporesponsive T cells. A) Outline of the experiments and analyses
  in this study. We performed in situ Hi‐C, RNA‐seq, and ATAC‐seq experiments on paired
  T cells (CD4 and CD8) from three healthy donors before and after G‐CSF mobilization
  in vivo. B) Volcano plot comparing CD8 TpreG and CD8 TpostG. The X‐axis shows the
  fold change (log2). Among the genes, 54 genes were significantly upregulated, and
  78 genes were significantly downregulated. C) Gene pathway enrichment analysis for
  the upregulated (red) and downregulated (blue) genes in CD8 TpostG cells. D) T‐cell‐activation‐associated
  chromatin accessibility changes in CD8 TpreG and TpostG. The T‐cell‐activation‐associated
  ATAC‐seq data base on Bediaga et al.[] E) The UCSC (University of California, Santa
  Cruz) browser views showing ATAC‐seq of representative open chromatin accessibility
  genes (PRDM1 and TNFAIP3) and close chromatin accessibility genes (JAK1 and IFNG)
  in CD8 TpostG cells compared with CD8 TpreG cells. F) Motif results predicted by
  HOMER (Hypergeometric Optimization of Motif EnRichment) software to have different
  types of loops in CD8 TpostG cells. CTCF is the transcription factor most significantly
  enriched in static loops. This finding is consistent with the existing literature.
  G) The regulatory network map of highly expressed genes and enhanced transcription
  factors in CD8 TpreG and CD8 TpostG cells. Red dots represent transcription factors,
  and purple dots represent target genes. The regulatory relationships between transcription
  factors and genes are based on Yan et al.[]
