caption: SKF dampened the activation of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways and upregulated
  Nrf2 antioxidative system in THP-1 cell-derived macrophages upon LPS stimulation.
  (A) Immunoblotting assay confirming the modulatory effects of SKF on p-65 phosphorylation
  for NF-κB activation, and p38, Erk1/2 phosphorylation for MAPK activation. (B–E)
  Western blot and the quantitative analysis exhibiting the impacts of SKF on pro-inflammatory
  NLRP3/Caspase-1 pathway (B, C) and antioxidative Nrf2, NQO1, HO-1 system (D, E).
  n = 3. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. Error bars represented mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis
  was performed using one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test.
