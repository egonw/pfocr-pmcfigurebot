caption: 'Melatonin interacts with MT1 to down-regulate pPKA/pCREB signaling. (A)
  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis suggested that melatonin may influence VEGF secretion
  by MT1/pPKA/CREB/clock genes/miR200b/Maspin signaling. (B) Enhanced biliary immunoreactivity
  (in liver sections, original magnification, 20×; scale bars: 20 μm; data are means
  ± SEM of 6 pictures from n = 3 different animals per group) and (C) mRNA expression
  (in isolated cholangiocytes) of Mtnr1a were observed in Mdr2-/- compared with WT
  mice, which was reduced in Mdr2-/- mice treated with melatonin. Data are means ±
  SEM of 3 evaluations from 3 cumulative preparations of cholangiocytes from 6 mice
  per group. (D) Immunoreactivity of pPKA is reduced in Mdr2-/- mice treated with
  melatonin for 12 weeks. Original magnification, 20×; scale bars: 100 μm black arrows
  showed the pPKA-bile duct positivity. (E) The pCREB/CREB ratio in isolated cholangiocytes
  showed increased activation of pCREB in Mdr2-/- mice compared with WT. Its activation
  was reduced after melatonin treatment. Both CREB and pCREB were normalized with
  total protein loading (Pounce S staining). Data are means ± SEM of 3 evaluations
  from cumulative preparations of cholangiocytes from 6 mice per group. Each dot represents
  1 value in data set. ∗P < .05 vs WT; #P < .05 vs Mdr2-/- mice.'
