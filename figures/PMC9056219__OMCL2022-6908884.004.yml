caption: 'EDA attenuated the PM-induced inflammatory cytokines and protein expression
  in lung tissues. Mice were intratracheally instilled with PM at 100 μg/day/mouse
  for 2 consecutive days. EDA (2, 10, or 20 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected
  prior to PM exposure for 1 h. (a) The levels of IL-6, IL-1α, and IL-1β in the BALF
  were measured by ELISA. (b) The level of COX-2 expression in lung tissues was measured
  by IHC staining. (c) The semiquantitative analysis was applied to compare the relative
  COX-2 protein expression. (d) COX-2 expression was determined by western blot. The
  optical densities of COX-2 are shown in (e). Values are the mean ± SEM;  ∗∗P < 0.01,
  compared with the control group; #P < 0.05 or ##P < 0.01, compared with the PM group;
  n = 5. EDA: edaravone; PM: particulate matter; BALF: bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.'
