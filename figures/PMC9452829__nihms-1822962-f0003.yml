caption: 'PAS-Na treatment decreased the Pb-induced hippocampal neuron apoptosis.
  a, b Primary hippocampal neurons were treated with 50 μM PbAc for 24 h, followed
  by 100, 200 or 400 μM PAS-Na treatment for 24 h. a Apoptosis in hippocampal neurons
  was determined using flow cytometry analysis. b Protein levels of cleaved caspase-3,
  Bax and Bcl-xL were determined by western blotting. c, d Rats were treated with
  10 mg/kg PbAc for 4 weeks during juvenile, followed by 80, 160 or 240 mg/kg PAS-Na
  treatment for 2 weeks. e, f Rats were treated with 2 mg/kg PbAc for 12 weeks, followed
  by 80, 160 or 240 mg/kg PAS-Na treatment for 6 weeks. c, e Apoptotic nuclei in hippocampal
  tissues of rats were determined using TUNEL assay. Brown-red-stained cell nuclei
  were considered positive apoptosis cells, while blue-stained nuclei were identified
  as negative cells. Scale bar = 50 μm. d, f Protein level of cleaved caspase-3, Bax
  and Bcl-xL were determined by western blotting. The protein expression was normalized
  by GAPDH or corresponding total protein content. * P < 0.05 and * * P < 0.01, compared
  to the control group. #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01, compared to the Pb-treated group.'
