caption: 'Mesenchymal stem cells‐derived extracellular vesicles carrying miR‐378a‐3p
  inhibits GATA2/AQP4/PPAR‐α pathway and reduced LPS‐induced apoptosis of M064 cells.
  (A) The vesicles in MSCs were analysed by transmission electron microscopy (500 nm).
  (B) The particle size of MSCs‐EVs was measured using a nanoparticle tracking analyzer.
  (C) The expression patterns of CD63, CD9 and calnexin in the EVs were detected by
  immunofluorescence and Western blot assay. (D) The uptake of MSCs‐EVs by M064 cells
  with different treatment was observed by fluorescence microscope (scale bar: 25 μm).
  (E) The expression pattern of miR‐378a‐3p in MSCs and MSCs‐EVs was detected by qRT‐PCR.
  (F) The expression pattern of miR‐378a‐3p in M064 cells with different treatment
  was detected by qRT‐PCR. (G) The mRNA expression patterns of GATA2 and AQP4 in M064
  cells with different treatment were detected by qRT‐PCR. (H) The protein expression
  patterns of GATA2, AQP4 and PPAR‐α in M064 cells with different treatment were detected
  by Western blot assay. (I) The proliferation of M064 cells was detected by CCK‐8
  assay. (J) The apoptosis of M064 cells was detected by flow cytometry. Data between
  two groups were compared by unpaired t test. *p < 0.05. **p < 0.01. ***p < 0.001.
  Cell experiments were conducted three times independently'
