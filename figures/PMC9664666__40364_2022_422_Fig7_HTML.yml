caption: Downregulation of SGOL2 expression promoted apoptosis in vivo. A-B IHC staining
  of CD34, Ki-67, PCNA, and EMT-related markers. Representative images and quantitative
  analysis results are shown. C The apoptotic area was dramatically increased in the
  shSGOL2 group compared with the shNC group. The results are presented as the mean ± SD,
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001
article_title: SGOL2 is a novel prognostic marker and fosters disease progression
  via a MAD2-mediated pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma.
