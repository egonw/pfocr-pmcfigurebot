caption: 'Tetrandrine (Tet) inhibits TRPC6 expression and RhoA/ROCK1 pathway in vivo.
  (a) The mRNA expression of TRPC6, synaptopodin, RhoA, and ROCK1 in kidney tissues
  of rats was measured by RT-qPCR. (b) The protein expression of TRPC6, synaptopodin,
  RhoA, and ROCK1 in kidney tissues of rats was detected by western blotting. Nephropathy
  rats were induced by adriamycin (ADRIA) and then treated with low-dose (LD), medium-dose
  (MD), and high-dose (HD) Tet, or cyclosporine A (CsA, a positive drug). ∗P < 0.05
  and ∗∗P < 0.01 versus the control group. #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01 versus the ADRIA
  group.'
