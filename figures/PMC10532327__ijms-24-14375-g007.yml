caption: 'Visualizing the activation of the EGR1-KLF4 signaling pathway during VM
  formation using a fluorescent-based reporter system. (A) Vector map of the fluorescent-based
  reporter system showing regulation of destabilized GFP (dsGFP) expression by the
  minP(KLF4) sequence. PEST is a peptide sequence characterized by a high content
  of proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine. (B) Activity diversity of minP(KLF4)
  within a single colony. MDA-MB-231/CMV-dsGFP or minP(KLF4)-dsGFP cells were seeded
  at low density to allow for the formation of single colonies. After 4 days, established
  single colonies were imaged. Yellow arrowheads indicate the more “active” cells.
  Scale bar: 200 μm. (C) Activation of minP(KLF4) during VM formation. MDA-MB-231/minP(KLF4)-dsGFP
  cells were seeded onto Matrigel and imaged after 1 h, 6 h, and 12 h. Scale bar:
  400 μm. (D) Activity diversity of minP(KLF4) within VM tube structures. MDA-MB-231/minP(KLF4)-dsGFP
  cells were seeded onto Matrigel-coated coverslips. Images were taken after 24 h.
  The yellow dashed line in the “Analysis” panel indicates the border of the “edge”
  of the tubes. Scale bar: 400 μm.'
