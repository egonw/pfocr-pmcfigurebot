caption: Summarized effects of Oryeongsan (ORS) and action mechanisms leading to amelioration
  of high blood pressure in 2K1C renovascular hypertensive rats. Clipping the left
  renal artery increased systolic blood pressure accompanied by accentuation of the
  systemic RAS and ACE-(Ang II)-AT1 receptor pathway and suppression of ACE2-(Ang-1-7)-Mas
  receptor/AT2 receptor signaling pathways in the kidney cortex and cardiac chambers.
  Cortical NHE3 and medullary AQP2 gene expressions were decreased. Renin synthesis
  was increased in the clipped kidney. Furthermore, ANP synthesis was accentuated
  in the left ventricle but suppressed in the atria. Plasma levels of PRA and aldosterone
  were increased. Treatment with ORS reversed the accentuated systemic RAS and ACE-AT1
  receptor pathway and suppressed ACE2-Mas receptor/AT2 receptor signaling in the
  kidney cortex and cardiac chambers. Renin synthesis in the clipped kidney was decreased,
  and atrial ANP synthesis increased. Plasma levels of PRA and aldosterone decreased,
  and ANP increased. SBP decreased by ORS concomitantly with an increase in GFR, urinary
  excretion of Na+ and volume, and a decrease in body water and Na+ retention. All
  these processes induced by ORS were associated with a decrease in SBP. These findings
  lead us to conclude that chronic treatment with ORS, a medicinal herbal formula,
  elicits an antihypertensive effect through modulation of the cardiorenal function
  via modulation of the RAS and NPS. G, glomerulus; P, proximal renal tubule; Cd,
