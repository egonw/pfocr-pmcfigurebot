  localization
caption: a, Representative images (left) and quantification (right) of CYTO-ID-positive
  cells from three independent HD-MSNs (HD.43, HD.40, HD.47, n=7~9) transduced with
  shCtrl, shRCAN1, or RCAN1. b, Immunoblotting (top) and quantification (bottom) of
  the expression of p62 and RCAN1 from three independent HD-MSNs (HD.43, HD.40, HD.47,
  n=3) transduced with shCtrl or shRCAN1. c, Autophagic flux measurements using tandem
  monomeric mCherry-GFP-LC3 (right top). Representative image (left) and quantification
  (right bottom) of autophagosome and autolysosome from cells having reporter signal
  puncta from three independent HD-MSNs (HD.43, HD.40, HD.47, n=5~6) transduced with
  shCtrl, shRCAN1, or RCAN1. d, Representative image (left) and quantification (right)
  of autophagosome and autolysosome from cells having puncta from three independent
  HD-MSNs (HD.43, HD.40, HD.47, n=3) transduced with TFEB Wildtype (WT), shRCAN1,
  or TFEB Phospho-mutant (SA, S142/211A). e, Quantification of Caspase 3/7 activation
  (left) and Annexin V signal (right) from three independent HD-MSNs (HD.40, HD.43,
  HD.47, n=8~12) transduced with TFEB WT, shRCAN1 or TFEB SA. f, Representative images
  (left) and quantification (right) of HTT inclusion bodies (IBs) from four independent
  HD-MSNs (HD.47, HD.40, HD.43, HD.45, n=4) transduced with TFEB WT, shRCAN1, or TFEB
  SA. Cells were immunostained with anti-HTT and TUBB3 antibodies. An average of 120
  cells per each were counted from three or more randomly chosen fields. Scale bars
  represent 10 μm (c,d,f). Statistical significance was determined using one-way ANOVA
  (a,c,d,e,f) and unpaired t-test (b); ****p<0.0001, ***p<0.001, **p<0.01, *p<0.05,
  ns, not significant, and mean±s.e.m. Each dot represents one individual’s reprogrammed
  HD-MSNs. The sample size (n) corresponds to the number of biological replicates.
