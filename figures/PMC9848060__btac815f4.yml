caption: The global properties in k2p. (A) The enrichment panels. All the enrichment
  analysis is done using Enrichr API. (B) The topological panel. The topological properties
  of each node are provided in a tabular format, which can be further sorted in an
  ascending or descending order. Additionally, a degree-betweenness plot is also provided
  to find the bottleneck (high-degree high-betweenness) proteins. (C) The top 15 IS
  in the network. Along with their topological properties, k2p also provides the class
  and structural details of the spreaders. (D) The pathway clustergram of the spreaders
  and associated pathways. (E) High tissue specificity and the subcellular localization
  information of the spreaders. (F) Finally, the spreaders are associated with disease
  hallmarks and the signalling pathways
