caption: T1R2 + T1R3-dependent and -independent sweet taste signaling pathways. TAS1R2
  + TAS1R3 is the primary sweet taste receptor that can bind to all known classes
  of sweet taste stimuli to activate the inositol 3-phosphate signaling pathway (left).
  This pathway triggers the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum, which
  leads to opening of the monovalent cation-selective TRPM5 channel, which causes
  membrane depolarization by allowing the influx of sodium ions. Depolarization and
  elevated levels of calcium cause ATP release through the large pore channel formed
  by CALHM1 and CALHM3. The KATP- and SGLT1 pathways, on the other hand, are selective
  for caloric sugars in the monosaccharide form (right). Complex starch is broken
  down into maltose by salivary amylase in the mouth. Maltose and other dietary disaccharides
  such as sucrose are broken down into monosaccharides by maltase and sucrase. Cotransport
  of sodium and glucose by SGLT1 induces membrane depolarization, while the KATPpathway
  requires catabolism of glucose to generate ATP through glycolysis, tricarboxylic
  acid cycle, and the electron transport chain, which then inhibits the KATP channel,
  triggering membrane depolarization.
