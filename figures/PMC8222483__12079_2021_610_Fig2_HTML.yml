caption: The interplay between CCN2/CTGF regulatory signaling pathways. Different
  signaling pathways of varying nature can converge to regulate the pro-fibrotic factor
  CCN2. For instance, the serine/threonine kinase receptor activatied by TGF-β signaling
  promotes Smad2/3-dependent induction of CCN2, a response synergistically potentiated
  by low oxygen availability. Such receptor activity is also required for LPA1/3-dependent
  LPA induction of CCN2. Adding more complexity, LPA-dependent signaling also requires
  JNK activation to induce CCN2, while Rho GTPase could be involved as well, being
  activated by LPA and the integrin/FAK axis. Furthermore, this axis also supports
  the effects of TGF-β and LPA. Hippo/YAP/TAZ signaling pathway emerges as the central
  sensor of those responses because it can be modulated by different extracellular
  cues and it can induce CCN2. This pathway can feedforward into TGF-β/Smad signaling
  by reducing Smad7 levels. Importantly, the YAP/TAZ pathway is activated by GPCRs
  such as those that are part of the LPA/LPARs axis. Whether LPA and TGF-B1, coupled
  with the integrin/FAK axis, converge with YAP/TAZ to regulate CCN2 is unknown, but
  would add a new spatial component for the control their pro-fibrogenic activity.
