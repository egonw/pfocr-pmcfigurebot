caption: Temperature responses of photosynthetic parameters measured in greenhouse‐grown
  AP3 and WT lines. (a) Net CO2 assimilation at 400 ppm CO2. (b) Maximum rate of Rubisco
  carboxylation V cmax. (c) Maximum electron transport rate (J max). (d) Apparent
  CO2 compensation point () calculated using the common intercept method and slope
  regression (Walker et al., ). Dotted (AP3) and dashed (WT) lines represent the modelled
  temperature response of each parameter based on either the calculated activation
  energy for each parameter (b–d) or by modelling the temperature response of photosynthesis
  according to the Farquhar‐von Caemmerer‐Berry model using parameters derived here
  (a). Data are the mean and standard error for n = 4–6 replicates. *Statistical differences
  at P < 0.05 between all AP3 lines and WT based on repeated measures ANOVA and Dunnett’s
  post‐hoc comparison.
