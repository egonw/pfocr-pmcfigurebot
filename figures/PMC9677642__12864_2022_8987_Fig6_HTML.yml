caption: Expression levels of synthase genes in the Pp IX synthesis pathway. A ALAS1
  expression levels in the WS group and DBS group at 16H and 22H in the shell gland.
  B ALAS1 expression levels in the liver and shell gland at 16H and 22H in the DBS
  group. C Expression of enzyme genes in the Pp IX synthesis pathway between WS and
  DBS groups at 16H in the shell gland. D Expression of enzyme genes in the Pp IX
  synthesis pathway between WS and DBS groups at 22H in the shell gland. ALAS1, δ-aminolevulinate
  synthase 1; ALAD, aminolevulinate dehydratase; HMBS, hydroxymethylbilane synthase;
  UROS, uroporphyrinogen III synthase; UROD, uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase; CPOX,
  coproporphyrinogen oxidase; PPOX, protoporphyrinogen oxidase. Data expressed as
  mean ± SD. **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05
