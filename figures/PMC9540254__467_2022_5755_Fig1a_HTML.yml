caption: Overview of the complement cascade. A Activation pathways. The classical
  pathway, mannose-binding lectin pathway, and alternative pathway converge on C3,
  cleaving C3 into activation fragments C3a and C3b. C3b joins with factor B, which
  is then cleaved by the rate-limiting enzyme factor D. This generates the Ba fragment,
  which can be measured as a marker of this process. It also creates the C3 convertase
  (C3bBb). C3bBb is involved in the amplification loop of the alternative pathway,
  increasing the generation of downstream activation fragments. C3b also joins with
  C3bBb to create the C5 convertase (C3bBbC3b), which converts C5 into C5a and C5b.
  C3a and C5a function as anaphylatoxins which cause chemoattraction of myeloid cells,
  leukocyte activation leading to release of proinflammatory mediations, and increased
  vascular permeability causing vascular leak. C5b joins with C6, C7, C8, and C9 to
  form C5b-9, also termed the membrane attack complex (MAC) which lyses target cells.
  B Complement regulatory proteins. Regulatory proteins are integral in controlling
  the complement cascade and preventing pathologic activation within tissues. Factor
  H is a regulator of the alternative pathway that inactivates C3b, competes with
  factor B for C3b binding (and prevents formation of C3 convertase), and accelerates
  C3 convertase decay. Factor H is a soluble protein that controls alternative pathway
  activation in the fluid phase, but it can also bind to cells and extracellular matrix
  to control activation at those locations. CD46 is another cofactor (for factor I)
  that mediates inactivation of C3b. CRIg (complement receptor of immunoglobulin family)
  acts on C3b and inhibits alternative pathway activation. CD59 binds C8 and C9, thereby
  preventing the formation of the membrane attack complex C5b-9. Decay accelerating
  factor (DAF or CD55) increases the breakdown of the C3 and C5 convertases within
  the pathway
