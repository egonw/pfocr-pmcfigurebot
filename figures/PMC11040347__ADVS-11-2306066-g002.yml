caption: 'Myeloid Mas modulates AILI microenvironment via the NF‐κB/TNF‐α pathway.
  A) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of
  DEGs in LysM creMas1 f/f‐APAP versus Mas1 f/f‐APAP groups for monocytes. The top
  twenty pathways are presented. B) Violin plots showing the key genes of TNF signaling
  pathway and NF‐kappa B signaling pathway for monocytes between groups. In C‐D, BMDMs
  from WT and Mas1 −/‐ mice were stimulated with LPS (100 ng ml−1) for 12 h to drive
  pro‐inflammatory activation. Activated BMDMs were collected for bulk RNA‐seq (n =
  5 or 6 samples per group). C) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs in Mas1 −/−
  versus WT BMDMs. The top twenty pathways are presented. D) Volcano plot showing
  the DEGs in Mas1 −/− versus WT BMDMs for TNF signaling pathway and NF‐kappa B signaling
  pathway. E) BMDMs from WT and Mas1 −/‐ mice were stimulated with LPS (100 ng ml−1)
  for 12 h to drive pro‐inflammatory activation. Representative IF images and the
  statistical results of nuclear translocation of p65 (n = 4 samples per group; two‐sided
  Student''s t‐test, p = 3.44 × 10−3) and TNF‐α (n = 4 samples per group; two‐sided
  Student''s t‐test, p = 4.07 × 10−3) are shown. Scale bar: 10 µm. F) BMDMs from WT
  and Mas1 −/− mice were stimulated with LPS (100 ng ml−1) for 12 h to drive proinflammatory
  activation. The TNF‐α of the CM were tested (n = 8 samples per group; two‐sided
  Student''s t‐test, p = 4.14 × 10−3). G) LysM creMas1 f/f mice were pre‐administrated
  with or without (Rac)‐Benpyrine (30 mg kg−1, ig) before APAP challenge (n = 4 mice
  per group). Representative stainings of H&E and mIHC are shown. Scale bar: 50 µm
  and 20 µm. H) LysM creMas1 f/f mice were pre‐administrated with or without R‐7050
  (10 mg kg−1, ip) for 2 h before APAP challenge (n = 4 mice per group). Representative
  stainings of H&E and mIHC are shown. Scale bar: 50 µm and 20 µm. In all graphs,
  data are presented as mean ± SD, **p < 0.01.'
