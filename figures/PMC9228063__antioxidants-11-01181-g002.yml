caption: 'Intracellular and extracellular distribution of redoxins. Subcellular localization,
  presence of the redoxins in the extracellular and intravascular space, as well as
  in extracellular vesicles. Unconventional secretion pathways of protein: the majority
  of the redoxins are secreted via these pathways; some of them are Trx, TrxR, Prx1,
  Prx2. Conventional secretion pathway: from the thioredoxin family protein, PDIs
  and Prx4 are known to be secreted via the conventional pathway, possessing a leader
  peptide that enables their secretion. Representation of ROS generation as part of
  the redox signaling. TLR4: Toll-like receptor 4. GSH: Glutathione. NOX: NADPH oxidase.
  AQP: Aquaporin. SOD: Superoxide dismutase. Prx: Peroxiredoxin. Trx: Thioredoxin.
  TrxR: Thioredoxin reductase. EV: Extracellular vesicle.'
