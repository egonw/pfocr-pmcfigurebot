caption: 'RIOK3 X2 expression triggers inflammatory pathway activation. (a) IL-8 mRNA
  expression in X2-inducing MO- vs. standard control MO-treated WT HEK 293 cells (b)
  TNFα mRNA expression in X2-inducing MO- vs. standard control MO-treated WT HEK 293
  cells (c) IL-8 mRNA expression in GFP- vs. RIOK3 X2-transfected WT HEK 293 cells
  (d) TNFα mRNA expression in GFP- vs. RIOK3 X2-transfected WT HEK 293 cells (e) Luciferase
  assay measuring NFκB promoter activity in GFP- vs. RIOK3 X2-transfected WT HEK 293
  cells (f) Luciferase assay measuring NFκB promoter activity in GFP- vs. RIOK3 X2-transfected
  RIOK3 KO HEK 293 cells. In plots (a,b), fold induction is relative to values of
  cells transfected with standard control MO and that were not treated with TNFα.
  Cells were grown in 12-well plates, seeded at a density ~0.2 × 106 cells/well, and
  treated with 80 ng/mL TNFα for 4 h. In (c,d), fold induction is relative to values
  of cells transfected with GFP and that were not treated with TNFα. In (c–f), cells
  were grown in 12-well plates, seeded at a density ~0.1 × 106 cells/well, and treated
  with 20 ng/mL TNFα. In (c–e), cells were treated with TNFα for 4 h, and in (f),
  cells were treated with TNFα for 24 h. Plots in (a–f) present the data as the mean
  value of 3 biological replicates +/− SEM. Student’s t-test: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001.'
