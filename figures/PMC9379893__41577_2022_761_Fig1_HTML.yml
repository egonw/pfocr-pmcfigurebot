figure_title: An overview of mechanotransduction pathways in cells
caption: a | Classical Hippo pathway activation induces phosphorylation of kinases
  MST1 and/or MST2, as well as LATS1 and/or LATS2, which in turn phosphorylate yes-associated
  protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). Phosphorylated
  YAP and TAZ are sequestered in the cytoplasm. Upon Hippo pathway inhibition, such
  as in response to mechanical force (denoted by F), YAP and TAZ translocate to the
  nucleus and drive gene expression that is key to immune function, including genes
  involved in cellular metabolic reprogramming, proliferation and responsiveness to
  inflammatory stimuli, through the TEA domain (TEAD) transcription factor family.
  b | Integrins anchor cells to the extracellular matrix (ECM), cluster and form focal
  adhesions, which act as multiprotein signalling hubs. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK)
  and SRC are key downstream effectors of focal adhesions, orchestrating various immune
  cell functions. Focal adhesions execute cell morphological changes either by actin
  polymerization-driven expansion or depolymerization and contraction with myosin.
  Polymerization of actin filaments (F-actin) subsequently reduces availability of
  G-actin (depicted by heavy arrow), decreasing its association with myocardin-related
  transcription factor A (MRTFA), which causes nuclear translocation of MRTFA, association
  with serum response factor (SRF) and gene transcription responsible for metabolic
  reprogramming, proliferation and cell responses to inflammatory stimuli. c | Mechanotransduction
  is also propagated directly from the cytoskeleton to the nuclear envelope via the
  linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, which includes the transmembrane
  proteins SUN and nesprin. LINC mediates nuclear morphology, chromatin organization,
  gene regulation and nuclear pore permeability, which also facilitates the nuclear
  translocation of YAP and TAZ and MRTFA. d | Transient receptor potential vanilloid
  type 4 (TRPV4) and PIEZO1 cation channels are activated by mechanical stimuli inflicted
  on the plasma membrane. Their activation promotes Ca2+ influx, impacting the regulation
  of many transcription factors, inflammatory signalling pathways and cytoskeletal
  reorganization.
