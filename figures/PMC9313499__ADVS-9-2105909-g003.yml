caption: Transcriptome analysis of the cartilage component in the inflamed miniJoint
  and comparison with the transcriptome of cartilage collected from human OA patients.[]
  a) Volcano plot showing 273 downregualted (in green) and 295 upregulated (in red)
  genes expressed in the cartilage tissue component (OC‐C) from control (Ctrl) and
  inflamed (IL‐1β) miniJoint. b) Common, significantly enriched pathways between OC‐C
  of the inflamed miniJoint and cartilage tissue from human OA patients. c) Network
  plot for DEGs in Osteoarthritis pathway in OC‐C of IL‐1β treated miniJoint.
