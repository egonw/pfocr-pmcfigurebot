caption: 'miR-124a regulates apoptosis of goat myoblasts: (A,B) Expression levels
  of cell-apoptosis-related genes (caspase-3, caspase-9, and beclin-1) in cells overexpressing
  and underexpressing miR-124a were quantified by RT-qPCR. (C,D) Western blot analysis
  revealed the expression of caspase-3 and beclin-1 after gain and loss of miR-124a.
  GAPDH was used as an internal reference. (E) Myoblasts overexpressing miR-124a were
  stained with annexin V–FITC/propidium iodide (PI), and then subjected to flow cytometry.
  (F) The percentage of miR-124a-overexpressing myoblasts in apoptosis. (G) Flow cytometry
  of myoblasts underexpressing miR-124a. (H) Percentage of miR-124a-underexpressing
  myoblasts in apoptosis. Replicates = 3. Data are presented as the mean ± SE; * p
  < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01. NC, negative control.'
