caption: 'Transcriptional induction of TRPC6 in neutrophils supports calcineurin/STAT2-dependent
  type 1 interferon signaling in new onset T1DSelected transcripts at the intersection
  of the indicated gene sets are labeled. Refer to supplementary text for cut-offs
  used for hypergeometric tests.(A) Genes that are transcriptionally repressed in
  response to TRPC6 depletion are induced in new onset T1D neutrophils.(B) A type
  1 interferon signature is strongly enriched in neutrophil T1D-induced genes. The
  IAV signature was retrieved from Malachowa et al. , Mex09 IAV vs. Mock RPMI-18h
  p < 0.05.(C) The type 1 interferon signature is super-enriched in neutrophil T1D-induced
  genes that are regulated by TRPC6.(D) Canonical transcriptional drivers of the type
  1 interferon response are consolidated among nodes with robust transcriptional footprints
  among TRPC6M↓∩NEOT1DI genes. TRPC6M↓∩NEOT1DI cut-offs: NEOT1DI LFC>0.5 & p < 0.05,
  TRPC6M LFC < −1 & p < 0.01. Nodes with the strongest and most significant intersections
  with the gene set are distributed in the top right quadrant of the plot.(E) Genes
  downregulated in response to Ppp3r1/CNB1 depletion in dendritic cells are enriched
  among NEOT1DI genes.(F) Genes downregulated in response to Ppp3r1/CNB1 depletion
  in dendritic cells are further enriched among TRPC6M↓∩NEOT1DI genes.(G) STAT2 HCTs
  downregulated in response to Ppp3r1/CNB1 depletion in dendritic cells are most strongly
  enriched among TRPC6M↓∩NEOT1DI genes.(H) Reactome interferon alpha/beta signaling
  pathway targets are very strongly enriched among TCS-NEOT1DI genes relative to NEOT1DI
  genes. Refer to  for the underlying data.'
