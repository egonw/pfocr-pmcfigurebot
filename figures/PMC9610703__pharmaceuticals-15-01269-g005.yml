caption: 'Signal transduction with diabetes-associated noncoding RNAs: (i) GLP1 binds
  to GLP-1 receptor and activates cAMP signaling pathway; miR-375 upregulates GLP
  1 ligand. cAMP recruits Epac and PKA to activate CREB, leading to insulin secretion;
  cAMP is inhibited by PDE3 and PDE4, which leads to reduction in insulin secretion;
  miR-23a and miR-27a-3p inhibit PDE4 and PDE3, respectively, thus upregulating cAMP.
  (ii) Insulin binds to the insulin receptor (IR) to activate insulin signaling pathway;
  insulin receptor is inhibited by miR-96. Upregulation of IR leads to activation
  of IRS1, PI3K, PIP3/PDPK and AKT, which are, respectively, inhibited by miR-145/miR-144,
  miR-148a, miR-375 and miR-26b. Activated AKT facilitates translocation of GLUT4
  from cytoplasm to cell membrane; miR-222 inhibits GLUT4. AKT mediates inhibitory
  phosphorylation of GSK3B and FOXO1. FOXO1 translocates to the nucleus and stimulates
  transcription of PEPCK in the gluconeogenesis pathway. (iii) FGF1 binds to FGF receptor
  and recruits FRS2, Grb2 and GAB1, which activates the PI3K/AKT pathway, leading
  to GLUT4 translocation from cytosol to cell membrane. (iv) High glucose concentration
  inhibits lncRNA MEG3, which, in turn, upregulates miR-34a. Upregulated miR-34a suppresses
  SIRT1, which leads to decrease in Bcl-2/Bax ratio, leading to apoptosis; suppressed
  SIRT1 promotes secretion of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α) via NF-κB
  signaling, leading to diabetic retinopathy. (v) NRF2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm
  by Keap1 bound to the actin cytoskeleton. Downregulated lncRNA MALAT1 leads to the
  suppression of inhibitor Keap1 and dissociation of NRF2. ERK1/2 phosphorylates NRF2,
  and NRF2 translocates to the nucleus where it binds with the antioxidant response
  element (ARE), stimulating transcription of antioxidant and detoxifying genes.'
