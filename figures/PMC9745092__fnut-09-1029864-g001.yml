caption: Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) enhanced the activity of PPARα and A-FABP
  promoter. (A,B) The 293T cells was plated in 24-well plates and then transfected
  with pGL3-pparα, or pGL3-afabp, and pGL3-Basic, pRL-TK. After 4 h, the cells were
  treated with CLA at a 100 μM final concentration. Dual luciferase reporter gene
  system was used to measure the activity of PPARα and A-FABP promoter. Data were
  analyzed by t-test. **P < 0.01.
