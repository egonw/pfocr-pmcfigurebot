caption: (A) The protein expression level of NF-κB signaling pathway in HT1080 cells.
  β-actin was used as an internal control. (B) Nuclear translocation of p65 was observed
  through an overlay of green p65 staining with blue DAPI staining and red cytoskeleton
  staining. Data are shown as mean ± SD (n = 3). p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), p <
  0.001 (***) compared with PMA alone treated control group.
