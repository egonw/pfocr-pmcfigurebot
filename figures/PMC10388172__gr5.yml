caption: MCODE cluster analysis and protein function module. A. MCODE cluster analysis
  was performed on 107 targets. B. Pathway enrichment results for MCODE1. Gene names
  in orange indicate genes belonging to the top 20 node degrees (21 in total) in the
  PPI network. C. Pathway enrichment results for MCODE2. D. Bar graph of transcription
  factors enrichment analysis (colored by p-values) (Genes of the top 20 node degrees
  (21 in total) regulated by the top 10 transcription factors are shown in B and C
  as an octagonal shape). (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure
  legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)
