caption: (A) After overexpression of miR‐155, the proliferation level of Hsas4 cells
  in the research group was lower than that in the control group at the same time
  point. However, after the addition of IGF‐1 (An Activator of PI3K/AKT Signaling
  pathway), compared with the research group, the proliferation level of Hsas4 cells
  in the IGF‐1 group increased. (B) After overexpression of miR‐506‐3P, the proliferation
  level of Hsas4 cells in the research group was lower than that in the control group
  at the same time point. However, after the addition of IGF‐1 (An Activator of PI3K/AKT
  Signaling pathway), compared with the research group, the proliferation level of
  Hsas4 cells in the IGF‐1 group increased.
