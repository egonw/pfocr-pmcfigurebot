caption: Adaptative activation of heterotrimeric G protein, Ras, and PI3K. (A) Homogeneouly
  applied (uniform) stimulation triggers a transient membrane translocation of a cytosolic
  protein in the cells. a, a resting cells expressing a cytosolic protein (green);
  b, cell is stimulated by uniform stimulation (red) and displays a response as membrane
  translocation of cytosolic protein to the plasma membrane (green); c, cell in adaptation,
  in which the cell’s response is terminated while still in the presence of the stimulus.
  (B) Simplified chemosensing signaling pathway, including activaiton of heterotrimeric
  G protein, Ras, PI3K, and PTEN in Dictyostelium discoideum. (C) Dynamics of chemoattractant
  concentration of chemoattractant, G protein activation, Ras activation, PIP3 production,
  and membrane-bound PTEN upon uniform stimulation.
article_title: Ras inhibitors gate chemoattractant concentration range for chemotaxis
  through controlling GPCR-mediated adaptation and cell sensitivity.
