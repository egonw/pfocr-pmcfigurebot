caption: 'Galangin decreased cell death in 6-OHDA-treated HT22 cells. (A) MTT assay
  of the viability of HT22 cells treated with 3.13–400 μM 6-OHDA for 24 h. (B) MTT
  assay of the viability of HT22 cells treated with 1.56–200 μM galangin for 24 h.
  (C) MTT assay of the viability of HT22 cells treated with 1.56–50 μM galangin in
  the absence or presence of 6-OHDA for 24 h. (D) Representative images of the cell
  morphology of HT22 cells treated with 6.25–50 μM galangin in the absence or presence
  of 6-OHDA for 24 h. Magnification: 10×; Scale bars: 200 µm. (E) Representative Hoechst/PI
  staining images of HT22 cells treated with 6.25–50 μM galangin in the absence or
  presence of 6-OHDA. Magnification: 10×; Scale bars: 100 µm. Bars, S.D., * p ≤ 0.05,
  ** p ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤ 0.001.'
