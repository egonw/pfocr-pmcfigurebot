caption: Analysis of GO enrichment and KEGG pathways. (a–c). The DEGs between patients
  with high risk and patients with low risk have been shown to be enriched mostly
  in immune-associated biological processes according to the GO enrichment analysis.
  (b–d) According to the KEGG pathway analysis, it is elucidated that the DEGs between
  high-risk and low-risk groups were typically enriched in complement and coagulation
  cascades, cholesterol metabolism, and PPAR signaling, etc.
