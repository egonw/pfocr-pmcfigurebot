caption: IBV Nsp14 interacted with chJAK1. (A) HD11 cells were co-transfected with
  pCMV-Myc-chJAK1 (1 μg), pCMV-Myc-chJAK2 (1 μg), and pCMV-Myc-chSTAT1 (1 μg) and
  either pcDNA3.1-Flag-Nsp14 (1 μg) or pcDNA3.1-Flag-EV (1 μg). The transfected cells
  were harvested. Co-IP was performed using an anti-Flag antibody (1:100). The precipitated
  proteins were analyzed using Western blotting by using anti-Myc antibodies. (B)
  Diagram of the N-terminal and C-terminal of Nsp14. (C) HD11 cells were co-transfected
  with pcDNA3.1-Flag-Nsp14-FL (1 μg), pcDNA3.1-Flag-Nsp14-N (1 μg), and pcDNA3.1-Flag-Nsp14-C
  (1 μg) and either pCMV-Myc-chJAK1 (1 μg) or pCMV-Myc-EV (1 μg). The transfected
  cells were harvested. Co-IP was performed using an anti-Flag antibody (1:100). The
  precipitated proteins were analyzed using Western blotting by using anti-Myc antibodies.
  (D) HD11 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-Flag-Nsp14 (1 μg) and pCMV-Myc-chJAK1
  (1 μg) for 24 h. The cells were fixed and subjected to an indirect immunofluorescence
  assay to detect colocalization. The colocalization of Nsp14 and chJAK1 was visualized
  using confocal fluorescence microscopy. (E,F) HD11 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-Flag-Nsp14-FL
  (1 μg), pcDNA3.1-Flag-Nsp14-N (1 μg), and pcDNA3.1-Flag-Nsp14-C (1 μg). After 24
  h, the cells were stimulated with chIFN-γ (100 ng/mL) for 6 h. The protein was detected
  using Western blotting, and luminescence was detected using dual-luciferase reporter
  assays. Data were presented as means ± SD. ** = p < 0.01, *** = p < 0.001, ns =
  not significant.
