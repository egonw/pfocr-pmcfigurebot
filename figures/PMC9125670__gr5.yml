caption: Comparison of PD-1-related genes between PTC patients with HT and Non-HT
  at the single-cell level. (A) UMAP plots for cell type identification of 17,438
  single cells from 6 PTC patients. (B) KEGG pathway analysis of differentially expressed
  genes from exhausted CD8+ T cell clusters. Average expression of previously identified
  PD-1-related genes in different groups (C) and across different cell types of PTC
  patients with HT (D). Gene symbols colored in red indicate the genes significantly
  elevated in PTC patients with HT at the single-cell level.
