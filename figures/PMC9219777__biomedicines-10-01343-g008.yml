caption: Distribution of differentially expressed genes in immunocompetent and immunocompromised
  hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2. (a) Scatter plot of SDEG in immunocompetent hamster
  lungs at 4 dpi. (b) Scatter plot of SDEG in immunocompetent hamster lungs at 16
  dpi. (c) Scatter plot of SDEG in immunocompromised hamster lungs at 4 dpi. (d) Scatter
  plot of SDEG in immunocompromised hamster lungs at 16 dpi. (e) Heat-map of SDEG
  involved in the hypercytokinemia/chemokinemia network. (f) Heat-map of SDEG involved
  in the canonical IFN signaling pathway. Scale bar shows upregulation (red) and no
  expression (black). FDRâ€”false discovery rate.
