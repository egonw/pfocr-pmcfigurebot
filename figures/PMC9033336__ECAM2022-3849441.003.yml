caption: 'Transmission electron microscope and western bolt results showed that EA
  treatment improved autophagy in AD mouse models. (a) TEM observation of autophagosome
  in the CA1 regions of mice brains in each group. EA therapy resulted in an increase
  in the number of autophagosomes in hippocampal neurons of AD mice. Scale bar in
  (a) = 1 μm (magnification = 20000x). (b) Autophagy-related genes Beclin 1 and LC3B
  in the hippocampus of the mouse were measured by qRT-PCR. EA treatment enhanced
  the mRNA levels of Beclin 1 and LC3B. (c, d) Beclin 1 and LC3B-II in hippocampus
  of the mouse were detected by immunoblotting quantitative analysis. β-actin was
  used as a loading control. EA administration elevated the protein expression of
  Beclin 1 and LC3B-II. The data (n = 3) are represented as mean ± SD.∗P < 0.05 vs.
  the control group; #P < 0.05 vs. the model group.'
