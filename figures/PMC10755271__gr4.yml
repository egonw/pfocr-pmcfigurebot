caption: 'PF leaf extract significantly suppressed the production of OVA-s-IgE and
  Th2 cytokines. (A) Levels of OVA-s-IgE in serum (n = 10), and levels of the cytokines
  of IL-4 (B), IL-5 (C), TNF-α (D) and IFN-γ (E) in BALF in the six groups (n = 5–6).
  (F) Fold changes of the IL-4/IFN-γ ratio in the six groups. Data represent the mean ± SD,
  and statistical analysis was performed by unpaired t-test. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01
  compared with the naïve group; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, versus the Model group.'
