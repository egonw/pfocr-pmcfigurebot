figure_title: cGAS-STING axis and IL-10 suppression were critical for Xkr8−/− PSin
  tumor restriction anti-cancer activity
caption: '(A and B) Pathway enrichment analysis of the genes upregulated in TAMs in
  Xkr8−/− PSin TMEs (both independent clones in , compared with WT TAMs), indicating
  both type I and II IFN response activation.(C) Tumor growth showed Xkr8−/− PSin
  tumor developed at the same level as WT tumors in Stinggt mice. n = 5 for mice in
  each group.(D) Image of tumors at the endpoint (day 16) of (C).(E) Weight of tumors
  at the endpoint (day 16) of (C).(F and G) FACS analysis indicated NK cells in Xkr8−/−
  TMEs, n = 5.(H) Tumor growth showed Xkt8−/− PSin tumor developed at the same level
  as WT tumors in Ifnar−/− mice. n = 5 for mice in each group.(I) Xkr8−/− tumor with
  cGAS deficiency (Xkr8−/−cGAS−/− double KO) developed at the same level as WT tumors
  in C57BL/6J mice. n = 5 for mice in each group.(J) TAMs in Xkr8−/− TMEs produced
  less IL-10, indicated by qPCR, n = 6.(K) Tumor growth of WT or Xkr8−/− MC38 cells
  in C57BL/6J mice with or without macrophage depletion via clodronate liposomes.
  n = 5 for mice in control group, n = 9 for mice in clodronate group.(L and M) Tumor
  growth of WT or Xkr8−/− MC38 cells in C57BL/6J mice, Il10−/−, and Il10rb−/− mice.
  n = 5 for mice in each group.(N) Living or apoptotic (dying) MC38 tumors (WT or
  Xkr8−/−) co-cultured with BMDMs in vitro for 18 h and IL-10 secretions in the supernatants
  were measured by ELISA.(O) Fluorescent immunostaining showed the presence of dying/dead
  cells (active caspase-3, red) in Xkr8−/− tumors other than WT tumors (DAPI, blue).(P)
  Quantitative analysis of percentage of the positive active caspase-3 cells in (O).
  Three tumors from three mice were analyzed in each group, and three random snapshots
  were captured from each tumor specimen. Tumor volumes were analyzed with two-way
  ANOVA. Column data were analyzed with unpaired t test. Data are representative of
  at least two independent experiments. Data represent mean ± SEM. ns, no significant
  difference; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001. PSin #2 was used in this analysis.'
