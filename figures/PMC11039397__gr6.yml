caption: SR1 inhibits bone loss in OVX mice(A and B) H&E staining results detect bone
  mass loss (Femur and tibia).(C and D) TRAP staining was used for sections of femurs.
  The number of osteoclasts and the area of osteoclasts per field of each specimen
  were measured.(E and F) The von Kossa staining was used for the sections of femurs
  and the mineralized surface area/bone surface area (MS/BS (%)) was measured.(G and
  H) Calcein-alizarin red S labeling to detect the femur mineral apposition rate (MAR)
  in mice. Scale bar, 100 μm. Data were presented as means ± SEM; n = 3; ∗p < 0.05,
  ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.
