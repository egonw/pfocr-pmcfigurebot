caption: Induction of autophagy by (+)-ABX and the impact of autophagy inhibition
  on apoptosis and anticancer effects. A Observation of cellular autophagic features
  using TEM. Scale bars, 5 μm, 2 μm, and 1 μm. B Western blot analysis of autophagy-related
  protein expression in cells treated with different concentrations of (+)-ABX. C
  Quantification of the data from panel B. D Western blot analysis of changes in autophagy-related
  protein expression after (+)-ABX treatment with CQ intervention. E Quantification
  of the data from panel D. F Western blot analysis of changes in apoptosis-related
  protein expression after (+)-ABX treatment with CQ intervention. G Quantification
  of the data from panel F. H CCK-8 assay measuring the impact of CQ pretreatment
  on cell viability after (+)-ABX exposure. Data are presented as means ± SD. * or
  △P < 0.05, ** or △△P < 0.01, and *** or △△△P < 0.001 compared with the control.
  The results were derived from a minimum of three independent experiments
