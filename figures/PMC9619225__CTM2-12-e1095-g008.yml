caption: 'Oroxylin A inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma growth in vitro and in vivo.
  (A) HepG2 cell viability measured by Cell Counting Kit‐8 assay after exposure to
  0‐200 μM oroxylin A for 12, 24, 48, and 72 h. Effects of oroxylin A on (B) glucose
  consumption and (C) NADPH/NADP+ ratio in HepG2 cells. (D) Apoptosis determined by
  annexin V‐FITC/PI staining and flow cytometry after exposure to various concentrations
  of oroxylin A for 48 h. (E) Cell cycle distribution determined by flow cytometry
  after exposure to 0‐200 μM oroxylin A for 24 h. Data are means ± SD; *p < 0.05 and
  **p < 0.01 versus negative control (n = 3). (F) Effect of oroxylin A on growth of
  HepG2 xenograft tumours. Tumour volume was measured using calipers every 3 days
  for 12 days, and photographs of tumours removed from animals. (G) Tumours were weighed
  (left panel) immediately after euthanasia and the growth inhibition rate was calculated
  (right panel). Data are presented as means ± SD; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001 versus
  the negative control (n = 7). (H) H&E staining of xenograft tumours. Scale bar:
  200 μm. (I) Body weight. (J) Macroscopic features of the liver of diethylnitrosamine‐treated
  mice in control and oroxylin A‐treated groups. (K) Number of liver tumours per mouse
  by microscopy.'
