caption: (A) Sankey plot showcasing key metabolites involved in significant enriched
  pathways. The dot plot shows the impact score and total number of metabolites in
  each enriched pathway (false discovery rate-adjusted p < 0.05). (B) Metabolic pathway
  analysis. x-axis, pathway impact; y-axis, âˆ’log10 (p). Circles represent the pathway
  impact score. Darker circles indicate more significant changes in metabolites in
  the corresponding pathway. The size of the circle corresponds to the metabolite
  counts in the corresponding pathway.
