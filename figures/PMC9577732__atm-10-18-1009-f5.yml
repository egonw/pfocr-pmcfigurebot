caption: The combination of miR-16 and HMGA2 predicts prognosis in CRC patients. (A,B)
  qPCR validation of miR-16 and mRNA of HMGA2 expression in 96 CRC patients. (C) The
  percentages of specimens showing low or high miR-16 expression relative to the levels
  of HMGA2 are shown. (D) The comparison of overall survival between 96 CRC patients
  exhibiting low or high miR-16 levels. (E) The comparison of overall survival between
  96 CRC patients exhibiting low or high HMGA2 mRNA levels. (F) The comparison of
  overall survival between patients exhibiting high miR-16 and low HMGA2 levels with
  the other patients in (D). (A,B) N=3, mean ± SEM, *P<0.05, by Student’s t-test.
  (C) The P value was evaluated by variance analysis. (D-F) The P value was evaluated
  by the log-rank test. A high miR-16 or HMGA2 mRNA expression in each of the 96 CRC
  patients was defined as a value above the 50th percentile. Data represents similar
  results from 2 independent experiments. CRC, colorectal cancer; qPCR, quantitative
  polymerase chain reaction; SEM, structural equation modeling.
