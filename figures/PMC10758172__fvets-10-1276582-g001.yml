caption: Combined protein and metabolome analyses screening for key functional proteins
  associated with IMP specific deposition. (A) Venn diagram of differential metabolites
  obtained by screening in positive and negative ion mode, blue is the differential
  metabolite in positive ion mode, red is the differential metabolites; (B) Top 20
  metabolic pathways enriched for DE metabolites in positive ion mode; (C) Top 20
  metabolic pathways enriched for DE metabolites in negative ion mode; (D) Differential
  proteins and metabolites jointly participate in 14 metabolic pathways; (E) Location
  of differential proteins and metabolites in Purine metabolism pathway, red text
  represents DE proteins, green text represents DE metabolites and blue text represents
  IMP.
