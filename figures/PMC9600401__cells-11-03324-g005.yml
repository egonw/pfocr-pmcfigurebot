caption: 'IL-1α or IL-8 upregulates the NFκB signaling pathway in early MSCs. Early
  MSCs at 50% confluence were treated with IL-1α (10 ng/mL) or IL-8 (10 ng/mL) in
  serum-free medium in a 10 cm dish for 24 h, followed by (A) measurement of protein
  level by proteome profiler human NFκB pathway array kit and (B) quantification of
  mean pixel intensity by Image J software. The labeled spots are: 1. NFκB1, 2. STAT2,
  3. IL-1 RI, 4. NFκB2, 5. IL-17 RA, 6. TNF RI/TNFRSF1A, 7. RelA/p65, 8. FADD/MORT1,
  9. IκBε, 10. LTBR/TNFRSF3, 11. SOCS6, 12. STAT1p91, and 13. IKK2/IKKβ. (C) Early
  MSCs were treated with IL-1α (10 ng/mL) or IL-8 (10 ng/mL) in a 10 cm dish for 72
  h, followed by measuring protein levels of IKK2, phospho-serine 536 p65 subunit
  of NFκB (pS536-p65), p16 and p21 by Western blotting. Actin served as the protein
  loading control. Fold change to Actin with normalization is shown. Data are expressed
  as mean ± SD (n = 3). Asterisks indicate significant differences as determined by
  the unpaired Student’s t-test (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 and **** p
  < 0.0001 versus control group, CTR).'
