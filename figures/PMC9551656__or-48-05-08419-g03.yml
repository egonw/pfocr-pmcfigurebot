caption: 'OTX1 activates the Wnt signaling pathway. (A) OTX1 co-expressed genes in
  cervical cancer were analyzed by Pearons''s test (LinkedOmics). (B) Top 50 genes
  associated with OTX1 expression in cervical cancer (LinkedOmics). (C) Pathway analysis
  of OTX1 co-expressed genes by LinkedOmics using GSEA. (D) GSEA showed that OTX1
  activated the Wnt signaling pathway. (E) Interaction network between OTX1 and Wnt
  proteins using GeneMANIA. (F) Co-IP assay was used to analyze the interaction between
  OTX1 and Wnt9b. Western blot for protein expression of Wnt9b, β-catenin, APC, GSK-3β
  and AXIN2 in (G) C-33A and (H) CaSki cells. All experiments were performed in triplicate.
  *P<0.05 vs. si-NC; #P<0.05 vs. pc-NC. OTX1, orthodenticle homolog 1; si, small interfering;
  NC, negative control; GSEA, gene set enrichment analysis; APC, adenomatous polyposis
  coli; GSK, glycogen synthase kinase; AXIN, axis inhibition protein; co-IP, co-immunoprecipitation;
  FDR, false discovery rate.'
