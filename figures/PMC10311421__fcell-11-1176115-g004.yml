caption: Comparison of DEGs between OE-BECs and OE-LECs. (A) Venn diagram showing
  numbers of common and BEC- and LEC-only downregulated genes in an analysis of GO
  terms. (B) Venn diagram showing numbers of common and BEC- and LEC-only upregulated
  genes in an analysis of GO terms. (C) Heatmap representing expression change of
  genes related to positive regulation of angiogenesis and MAPK/ERK pathway. (D) Heatmap
  representing expression change of genes related to ion transport and immune response.
