figure_title: RNA-seq analysis reveals distinct transcriptional signatures conferred
  by CDK9 or DHODH inactivation in combination with gilteritinib treatment
caption: '(A) PCA of transcriptomes of all combination and single arms over replicates.
  (B) Top: PCA plots of three biological replicates of gilteritinib-treated shCDK9-stable,
  and 48-hour vehicle-treated scrambled shRNA-stable cells. Bottom: PCA plots of three
  biological replicates of gilteritinib-treated shDHODH-stable and 96-hour vehicle-treated
  scrambled shRNA-stable cells. (C and D) Heatmap representations of normalized read
  counts of the top 25 down-regulated and the top 25 up-regulated DEGs in shCDK9/gilteritinib
  and shDHODH/gilteritnib combination treatments. Different treatment groups are color-coded
  (purple: scrambled + vehicle; cyan: scrambled + gilteritinib; pink: shCDK9 + vehicle
  or shDHODH + vehicle; and green: shCDK9 + gilteritinib or shDHODH + gilteritinib).
  (E and F) Volcano plots of selected treatment groups with respect to the corresponding
  scrambled/vehicle controls. Significantly down-regulated and up-regulated DEGs are
  highlighted in red. FC, fold change. (G) Venn diagram showing the overlaps among
  the top coessential genes in CRISPR screen negative selection, the top down-regulated
  DEGs in shCDK9/gilteritinib combination RNA-seq, and the top down-regulated DEGs
  in shDHODH/gilteritinib combination RNA-seq (CRISPR screen: FDR < 0.25; RNA-seq:
  Padj < 0.05). Pathway enrichment analysis of overlapped genes in three datasets
  is shown. (H) Up-regulated DEGs and enriched pathways shared by shCDK9/gilteritinib
  combination RNA-seq and shDHODH/gilteritinib combination RNA-seq. GLT, gilteritinib;
  Veh, vehicle; Scr, scrambled.'
