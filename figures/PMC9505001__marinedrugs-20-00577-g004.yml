caption: Overview of the expression and screening strategy for the limonene production
  in C. reinhardtii. (a) Expression vectors for the fluorescent reporter RFP (V9)
  and streptomycin 3″-adenylyltransferase (aadA) (V10); expression vector for the
  fusion of the codon-optimized limonene synthase (LS) to the N-terminus of aadA (V11);
  expression vectors for the fusion of LS and isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IDI)
  to the N-terminus of aadA and mRuby2 in the pOpt_aadA and pOpt_mRuby2_Ble constructs,
  respectively (V12). All constructs in this work were transformed into C. reinhardtii
  strains and recovered under selective antibiotic conditions, as depicted. (b) Microplate
  reader-screened strains expressing fluorescent fusion proteins. Three biological
  replicates were used to calculate the fluorescence intensity averages and SDs. Statistical
  significance (one-way ANOVA) compared to UVM4 is represented by asterisks (** indicates
  a difference at the p ≤ 0.01 level). (c) Fluorescence microscopy images of the parental
  strain (UVM4) and representative individual cells co-expressing ScCK-YFP, AtIPK-CFP,
  IDI-RFP and MsLS-aadA. Scale bars represent 5 µm. The PsaD chloroplast target peptide
  (CTP) was used for all expression constructs. The YFP, CFP, and RFP, could be targeted
  effectively to the algal chloroplast with this CTP. (d) Western blot of a total
  cellular protein with an α-StrepII tag antibody. V12-203 and V12-209 expressing
  strains exhibit signals at the appropriate predicted molecular mass (~ 92/88, 62,
  and 47 kDa). The predicted molecular masses of ScCK-YFP (~92 kDa) and MsLS-aadA
  (~88 kDa) were basically the same. So, three bands were detected. M—marker. (e)
  GC elution profiles and mass spectra of limonene and dodecane samples. (f) Limonene
  was detected by GC-MS in dodecane samples used as the organic-phase overlay in shake
  flasks. No peak for limonene was detectable in dodecane samples from the parental
  strain (UVM4 and V4-49) and a dodecane control. Three biological replicates were
  used to calculate limonene yield averages and SDs. One-way ANOVA was used for the
  statistical analyses. Different letters (a–e) indicate significant differences (p
  ≤ 0.05).
