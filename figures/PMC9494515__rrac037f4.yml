caption: miRNA expression profile of skin tissues after radon irradiation. (A) and
  (B) Heatmap and volcano plot of the dysregulated miRNAs between the two groups (n = 3).
  Expression levels are reflected by color change. Red denotes higher expression,
  whereas green denotes lower expression. (C) Differentially expressed miRNAs in radon
  irradiated skin tissues of mice. (D) The KEGG pathway enrichment of the dysregulated
  miRNAs from mouse skin tissues in response to radon. (E) GO analysis of the dysregulated
  miRNAs were performed by ClueGO. (F) The miRNA regulated PPIN between dysregulated
  miRNAs and proteins. In this network, red node denotes the miRNA, yellow nodes denote
  miRNA directly targeted genes, and green nodes denote genes connected with target
  genes. The red lines represent a negative regulatory relationship initiated by miRNAs.
  The black lines represent interactions between protein and protein.
