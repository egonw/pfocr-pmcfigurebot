caption: Mesangial cells exhibit dominant signaling networks in DN glomeruli. a Dot
  plot showing mesangial marker genes encoding transmembrane proteins responsible
  for the perception and transduction of mechanical signals. MSCs, mechanosensitive
  ion channels; GPCRs, G protein-coupled receptors. b Change of cell–cell interactions
  in all pairs of kidney cell types in DN vs. Ctrl mice. c Change of cell–cell interactions
  in all pairs of glomerular cell types in DN vs. Ctrl mice. d Increased cell–cell
  interactions for mesangial cell signaling to podocytes and glomerular endothelial
  cell in DN mice

  pathway in early diabetic nephropathy.
