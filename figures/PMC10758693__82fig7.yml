caption: Metabolic flux analysis for purine nucleotide biosynthesis in DMS273 cells
  with or without HPRT1 expression. A, Schematic describing the experimental design
  used to analyze the metabolite incorporation of [13C2, 15N]-glycine (M+3) in the
  purine de novo pathway and [13C5, 15N4]-hypoxanthine (M+9) in the purine salvage
  pathway. B, Intracellular levels of Gly (M+3), AMP (M+3), ADP (M+3), and ATP (M+3)
  derived from the purine de novo pathway in the HPRT1-knockout (KO) DMS273 cells
  transfected with control vector (KO+V) or HPRT1 cDNA (KO+H). The cells were treated
  with [13C2, 15N]-glycine (M+3) and [13C5, 15N4]-hypoxanthine (M+9) for 0, 2, and
  6 hours. C, Intracellular levels of hypoxanthine (M+9), AMP (M+9), ADP (M+9), and
  ATP (M+9) derived from the purine salvage pathway in the KO+V or KO+H cells. D,
  Effect of LMX on tumors from KO+V or KO+H cells (n = 8). After the tumor size reached
  >100 mm3, lemetrexol (25 mg/kg) was administered intravenously every 2 days. Data
  are presented as mean ±  SD. Two-tailed Student t test and P values are indicated
  as *, P < 0.05.
