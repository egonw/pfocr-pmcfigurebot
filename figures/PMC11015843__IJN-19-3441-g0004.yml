caption: 'Catalase-based nanoparticles produce oxygen in situ in hypoxia areas. (A)
  Schematic illustration of the synthesis processes for CAT&SMT@ZIF-8-Ab NPs. (B)
  Modified ZIF-8 NPs target synovial macrophages to regulate intracellular gases and
  reprogram the metabolic pathway, thus attenuating OA. (C) The percentages of M1
  (CD206-negative and CD16/32-positive cells) and M2 (CD206-positive and CD16/32-negative
  cells cells) macrophages were evaluated by flow cytometry. (D) Expression levels
  of genes related to M1-type macrophage including IL-1β, IL-12b, IL-6, TNF-α, and
  Inos/Arg-1 were measured by Qrt-PCR. Superscript symbol “*” indicates comparisons
  with the first group, and superscript symbol “#” indicates comparisons with the
  second group. Comparisons between ZIF-8 and CAT&SMT@ZIF-8 NP-treated groups and
  CAT&SMT@ZIF-8 and CAT&SMT@ZIF-8-Ab NP-treated groups were calculated and marked
  with the superscript symbol “&”. Superscript symbols “*”, “#”, and “&” indicate p
  < 0.05; superscript symbols “**”, “##”, and “&&” indicate p < 0.01; NS means not
  significant. Reprinted from Zhou F, Mei J, Yang S, et al. Modified ZIF-8 Nanoparticles
