caption: 'GXNI reduced the volume of myocardial infarction in I/R mice. After 30 min
  of myocardial ischemia and 24 hrs of reperfusion, the myocardial tissue of mice
  in each group, including sham, I/R, metoprolol, GXNI 1 mL/kg, GXNI 3 mL/kg and GXNI
  9 mL/kg, were stained with TTC. (A) Representative images of TTC staining for each
  group. Normal myocardial tissue was in red, while the infarcted area was in white.
  (B) Quantification of infarct volume in each group. (C) Representative pictures
  of H&E staining results of myocardial tissue, in which myocardial injury was indicated
  by yellow arrow. The upper part was the panoramic scanning image of the cross-section
  of the cardiac tissue in each group (Scale bar = 600 μm), and the lower part was
  the corresponding local image (Scale bar = 40 μm). (D–H) The levels of LDH, AST,
  CK, CK-MB and cTNT in serum of mice in different groups were measured by automatic
  biochemical analyzer and ELISA kit. Values were expressed as mean ± SEM (n = 6).
  ###P < 0.001 vs. sham group, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 vs. I/R group.'
