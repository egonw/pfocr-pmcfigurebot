caption: 'While TopBP1 is dispensable for YFP-APE1 nucleolar localization, the W119
  residue within APE1’s putative ATR activation domain is required for its biomolecular
  condensate formation in nucleoli and nucleolar ATR activation. (A) YFP-APE1 still
  assembled condensates and activated ATR-chk1 pathway when endogenous TopBP1 was
  knocked down via siRNA. After 1-d incubation of CTL or TopBP1 siRNA in PANC1 cells,
  YFP or YFP-APE1 overexpression plasmid was added and incubation for another 3 d.
  The cells were fixed and incubated with anti-TopBP1-AF647 for fluorescence microscopy
  analysis. (B). After 1-d incubation of CTL, TopBP1 and/or ETAA1 siRNA in PANC1 cells,
  YFP or YFP-APE1 overexpression plasmid was added and incubated for another 3 d.
  The cells were extracted and examined by immunoblotting analysis as indicated. (C)
  Schematic diagrams of functional domains of hAPE1, hTopBP1 and hETAA1 as well as
  sequence alignment of the N-terminal domain and putative ATR activation domain (AAD)
  within APE1. hAPE1 (human APE1, NCBI#: P27695.1), mAPE1 (mouse APE1, NCBI#: NP_033817.1),
  xAPE1 (Xenopus laevis APE1, NCBI#: AAH72056.1), hTopBP1 (human TopBP1, NCBI#: Q92547.3),
  and hETAA1 (human ETAA1, NCBI#: NP_061875.2). * identical;: highly conserved;. low
  conservation. In the AAD alignment, highlighted green indicates aa with hydrophobic
  side chains, highlighted yellow indicates aa with polar uncharged side chains, highlighted
  pink indicates aa with positive charged sides chains, highlighted turquoise indicates
  aa with negative charged sides chains, and highlighted gray indicates the conserved
  WxxP/N peptide. (D) The K6, K7 and W119 residues within APE1 are important for Chk1
  phosphorylation induced by YFP-APE1 in PANC1 cells. After YFP, WT or mutant (i.e.
  K6R/K7R, K24R/K25R, K31R/K32R, W119R) YFP-APE1 overexpression plasmid was added
  to PANC1 cells and incubation for 3 d, total cell lysates were extracted and examined
  via immunoblotting analysis as indicated. (E) APE1 forms biomolecular condensates
  in nucleoli dependent on its W119 residue. After WT or mutant (i.e. K6R/K7R, K24R/K25R,
  K31R/K32R, W119R) YFP-APE1 overexpression plasmid was added to PANC1 cells and incubation
  for 3 d, the cells were fixed and incubated with anti-NPM1-AF647 for overnight at
  4°C, followed by fluorescence microscopy analysis. (F) WT but not W119R YFP-APE1
  directly activates ATR to phosphorylate Chk1 phosphorylaton at S345 in vitro. In
  in vitro kinase assays, equal amount of His-YFP, WT or W119R His-APE1-YFP was added
  to the kinase assays (purified Flag-ATR as kinase and purified His-Chk1 as substrate).
  Beads bound with lysates from HEK293 cells without Flag-ATR transfection were used
  as a negative control (‘Control’). ‘No addition’ indicate the kinase assays without
  the addition of His-YFP or WT/W119R His-APE1-YFP. The samples were examined via
  immunoblotting analysis as indicated. (A, E) All scale bars = 10 μm.'
