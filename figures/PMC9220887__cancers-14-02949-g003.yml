caption: 'Caspase activation. (A): Western blot analysis of total (T) and cleaved
  (Cl) caspase-3, full length (FL) and cleaved PARP1, and ER stress-related proteins
  at 12 h and 24 h after CB-5083 and/or mifepristone (mif). (B). Immunoblot (IB) analysis
  of ubiquitinated (K48-linked) proteins following CB-5083 or mifepristone treatment.
  Both (A,B) were performed in at least two biological replicates. Uncropped immunoblots
  can be found in . (C). Analysis of caspase activities following indicated treatment
  at 18 h. p values were calculated using the two-tailed Studentâ€™s t-test.'
