caption: 'DJ-1 expression is associated with poor survival in osteosarcoma (OS). Representative
  immunohistochemical staining of DJ-1 in human OS tissues (n=75) and negative control.
  (A) The nuclear staining of DJ-1 was categorized and represented as follows: score
  1(+), score 2(++), score 3(+++). (B) Relative RNA level in OS lesions was higher
  than that in para-tumor tissues. (C) The overall survival curves of OS patients
  (n=75) are shown for different DJ-1 expression levels. Log-rank tests were used
  to determine statistical significance. ***P < 0.001.'
