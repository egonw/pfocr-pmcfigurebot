caption: Functional analysis of the METTL14/lncDBET/FABP5/PPARγ pathway. (A-B) CCK8,
  Transwell, EdU and flow cytometry assays for the viability, migration, proliferation
  and apoptosis of EJ-M3 cell lines transfected with shPPARγ+pcDH-FABP5+shlncDBET,
  pcDH-FABP5+shlncDBET, pcDH-NC+shlncDBET and pcDH-NC+shNC. (C-D) CCK8, Transwell,
  EdU and flow cytometry assays for the viability, migration, proliferation and apoptosis
  of EJ-M3 cell lines transfected with pcDH PPARγ+shFABP5+pcDHlncDBET+shMETTL14, shFABP5+pcDH-lncDBET+shMETTL14,
  pcDH-lncDBET+shMETTL14, pcDH-NC+shMETTL14 and pcDH-NC+shNC. Each experiment was
  repeated a minimum of three times. The symbol * denotes a significant difference
  (P < 0.05), while ** represents a highly significant difference (P < 0.01).
