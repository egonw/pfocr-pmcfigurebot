caption: 'PANoptosis was activated in SAE rats. The protein levels of (A) caspase-3,
  Bcl-2, (B) NLRP3, caspase-1, (C) RIPK1, RIPK3, and p-MLKL in sham and CLP groups
  are shown, with GAPDH used as the loading control. n = 5. Data are represented by
  histograms, and sham group is normalized. ∗P < 0.05. All experiments were repeated
  three times and error bars depict mean ± standard deviation. (D) At 24 h after CLP,
  cortical neurons in sham and CLP groups were observed by TEM, and the morphology
  is normal in sham group, while CLP group shows the characteristics of apoptosis,
  pyroptosis, and necroptosis (arrows). Scale bar = 1 or 2 μm. CASP: Caspase; CLP:
  Cecal ligation and perforation; MLKL: Mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein;
  NLRP3: NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3; PANoptosis: Pyroptosis,
  apoptosis, and necroptosis; RIPK: Receptor-interacting protein kinase; SAE: Sepsis
  associated encephalopathy; TEM: Transmission electron microscope.'
