caption: SW480/oxaliplatin exosomes are enriched in BMP-2, which improve angiogenesis
  via the inhibition of the Smad signaling pathway. HUVECs were co-cultured with SW480/oxaliplatin
  exosomes (40 μg/mL) with or without the treatment of si-RNA. (a) The expression
  of BMP-2 in exosomes. (b) Proliferation assay of HUVECs. (c) The Transwell assay
  determined the HUVECs migration. (d) The expression of CD31 detected by immunofluorescence.
  (e) The protein expression of VEGF and phosphorylation Smad5 in HUVECs. All above
  experiments were repeatedly performed 3 times; data are shown as the means ± SD.
  ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01.
