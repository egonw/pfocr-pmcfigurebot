caption: Myeloid PPARα deficiency mice show increased cell cycle-related gene expression
  at 32 h after PHx. (A-D) qPCR analysis for mRNA levels of cell cycle related gene
  Pcna, Ccnd1, Ccna2, and Ccne1 in Pparafl/fl and PparaMye−/− liver at 0, 24, 32,
  40, and 48 h after PHx (n=5). (E-G) Western blot analysis of CYCD1 and PCNA protein
  levels in Pparafl/fl and PparaMye−/− liver at 32 and 40 h after PHx (n=3). Data
  are expressed as means ± SD. *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01. PHx, partial hepatectomy; qPCR,
  quantitative real-time RT-PCR.
