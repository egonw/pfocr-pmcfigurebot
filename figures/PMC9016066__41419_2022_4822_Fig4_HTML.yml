figure_title: LNMSCs suppress activated T-cell apoptosis via MCP-1/PD-L1 axis
caption: A–C The elevated expression of PD-L1 was significantly suppressed in LNMSCs
  after co-culture with T cells. n = 3 (A), n = 4–8 (C). D, E BMMSCs promote T-cell
  apoptosis via NF-κB/PD-L1 signaling pathway. F Blocking PD-L1 in BMMSCs abolished
  their function to promote T-cell apoptosis. Overexpression of PD-L1 in LNMSCs rescued
  their capacity to promote T-cell apoptosis. n = 3–6. G, H Western blotting showed
  significantly elevated expression of PD-L1 in LNMSCs after treatment with MCP-1
  siRNA. The inhibition of PD-L1 by MCP-1 in LNMSCs is associated with NF-κB/PD-L1
  signaling pathway. n = 3–4 (H). I Downregulation of the expression of MCP-1 in LNMSCs
  markedly increased the T-cell apoptotic rate when co-cultured with the siRNA-treated
  LNMSCs, while the blocking of PD-L1 reversed the T-cell apoptotic rate increase
  caused by the usage of MCP-1 siRNA. n = 3-4. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
