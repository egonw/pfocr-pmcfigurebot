caption: MOBT treatment reduced α-SMA expression. (A) The immunofluorescence result
  demonstrated that the BLM group expressed abundant α-SMA compared with the sham
  group, whereas the MOBT treatment significantly decreased the α-SMA expression.
  The red color indicates α-SMA. The blue color indicates nucleus. (B) The immunohistochemical
  result indicated that the sham group had distinct alveolar structures and thin alveolar
  walls. The alveolar structure in the BLM group was disordered and had thick alveolar
  walls. The MOBT treatment significantly improved the lung alveolar structure and
  decreased α-SMA deposition. The brown color indicates α-SMA.
