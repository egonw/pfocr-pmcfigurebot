caption: 'Genetic potential for select carbon metabolism across the water column and
  sediments of Lac Pavin. a Relative abundance of genomes encoding C1 pathways across
  metagenomic samples. Bubble size indicates the combined coverage of all organisms
  encoding a given pathway in each sample normalized by the total coverage of all
  genomes in the quality-filtered, non-redundant set. The dashed box around methane
  production indicates the data points expanded in part b), showing the relative abundance
  (again, as indicated by percent of total genome coverage) for organisms from methanogenic
  lineages, with and without mcr genes. Abbreviations: CO, carbon monoxide; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid cycle; anox., anoxic zone; sed., sediment; mcr, methyl-coenzyme M reductase'
article_title: Variable impact of geochemical gradients on the functional potential
  of bacteria, archaea, and phages from the permanently stratified Lac Pavin.
