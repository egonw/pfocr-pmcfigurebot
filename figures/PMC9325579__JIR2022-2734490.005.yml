caption: 'Distribution of enriched KEGG pathways of cluster B: 51 miRNAs deregulated
  only in the T1D 2-5y group. The chart shows category rankings. The X-axis value
  represents the number of microRNA''s targets in the pathway and the Y-axis the pathways.
  (a) Represents the potential genes from up-expressed microRNAs. (b) Represents the
  potential genes from down-expressed microRNAs in comparison with controls. AbP group
  (individuals without diabetes expressing islet autoantibody), recent T1D group (newly
  diagnosed T1D patients with duration â‰¤6 months), and T1D 2-5y group (patients with
  T1D with 2 to 5 years of duration); health control group; Rq: relative expression
  represented by fold change in comparison to controls; p value: corrected p value.
  Only target genes identified by 20% or more of the DEMs with seed of conserved 7-8
  mers were submitted to functional enrichment analysis.'
