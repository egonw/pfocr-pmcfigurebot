caption: 'Glucose metabolism was elevated in LCSCs compared to non-stem cells: (A,B)
  OCR and ECAR in CSCs and non-CSCs were measured in two cell lines. (A) Glycolysis-stress
  test, and (B) Mito-stress test. Relative expression of rate-limiting enzyme genes
  of metabolic pathways in CSCs and non-CSCs was detected by qPCR and is shown as
  follows. (C,D) mRNA expression of glycolysis pathway key enzymes, including LADH,
  GLUT1, HK2, PFK1, and PKM. (E) mRNA expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex
  (PDHC), which includes PDHA, PDHB, and PDHK. PDHC plays an important role in mitochondrial
  oxidative respiration chain energy metabolism. (F) mRNA expression of mitochondrial
  biosynthesis key enzymes, including TFAM, PGC1a, and NRF1. These data represent
  the mean ± SD from at least three independent experiments. Two-way Student’s t-test.
  mRNA expression levels were normalized by β-actin endogenous control. * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, **** p < 0.0001.'
