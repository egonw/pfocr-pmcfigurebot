caption: mir-31-5p antagomir restored intestinal mucosal tight junction protein and
  reduced colonic inflammation in DSS-induced colitis mice. (A) Immunofluorescence
  staining of ZO-1 and occludin in colon tissue (x200 magnification). (B) Quantitative
  fluorescence analysis of ZO-1 and occludin (ordinate represented the average fluorescence
  intensity analyzed by ImageJ software). (C) ELISA analysis of the expression of
  IL-1β, TNF-α, TGF-β and IL-10 in colon. Each bar represents mean ± SD, n ≥ 3 from
  each group. ns represented P > 0.05, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P
  < 0.0001 vs. DSS group.
