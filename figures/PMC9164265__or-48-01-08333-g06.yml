caption: The effect of CSF2 inhibitors on drug sensitivity and the conversion of the
  non-NE phenotype to the NE phenotype. H69A cells were treated with different concentrations
  of butoconazole nitrate (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 µg/ml) and cell
  viability was detected with Alamar Blue after treatment for (A) 24 h and (B) 48
  h. (C) H69A cells treated with 3 and 7 µg/ml butoconazole nitrate. The cells were
  collected after treatment for 24 and 48 h. The expression of CSF2 and GAPDH were
  analyzed by using western blotting. (D) Quantitative analysis of (C), mock-treated
  H69A cells were used as the control (100%). Data are presented as the mean ± standard
  deviation of three independent experiments. (E) H69A cells were treated with butoconazole
  nitrate (7 µg/ml) combined with anlotinib (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4 and 6 µg/ml),
  (F) CS2164 (0, 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6 and 10 µg/ml) and (G) RAD001 (0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8,
  10 and 20 µg/ml) for 24 h. Cell viability was tested by using Alamar Blue. (H) H69A
  cells were treated with butoconazole nitrate (3 and 7 µg/ml) for 24 h. Western blotting
  was used to detect the expression of CSF2, SYP, CD44, YAP1 and GAPDH. (I) Quantitative
  analysis of (H), mock-treated H69A cells were used as the control (100%). Data are
  presented as the mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments. *P<0.05.
