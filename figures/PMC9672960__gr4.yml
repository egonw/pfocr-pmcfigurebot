caption: Loss of Alox5 counteracts MAPKs and EGFR signaling. a. Schematic diagram
  illustrating the experimental design to identify the key molecular events underlying
  Alox5 function in TAC-induced hypertrophy based on transcriptomics analysis. b.
  Heat map showing the general transcriptomic characteristics in Alox5 fl/fl and Alox5
  cKO mice with sham or TAC surgery for 4 weeks (n = 3). c. Gene ontology (GO) analysis
  showing key molecular signatures both involved in cardiac remodeling process and
  regulated by Alox5. d. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showing the enrichment
  score of MAPK and EGFR signaling pathway gene sets in the heart tissue of Alox5
  cKO and Alox5 fl/fl mice after TAC surgery for 4 weeks. e and f. Heat map showing
  the expression profile of MAPK and EGFR signaling pathway gene sets in the heart
  tissue of Alox5 cKO and Alox5 fl/fl mice after TAC surgery for 4 weeks. g and h.
  Immunoblotting and quantitation of phosphorylated and total expression of P38, ERK1/2,
  JNK and EGFR in the heart tissue of Alox5 cKO and Alox5 fl/fl mice after sham or
  TAC surgery for 4 weeks. Two-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test. The results are
  shown as mean ± SEM. P values are indicated.
