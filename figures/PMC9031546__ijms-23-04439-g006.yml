caption: 'The auxin pathway is involved in the ELP1 regulated pulvinus development.
  (A) Diagram of auxin biosynthesis and signaling pathway-related genes. The colored
  genes are corresponding to the genes listed in figure (B) with same color, respectively.
  (B) RT-qPCR of auxin related genes transcription in pulvinus of WT and the equivalent
  position of elp1 mutants. Values shown in the form mean ± SD (n = 3), and asterisks
  indicate a statistically significant difference between WT and elp1 (***, p < 0.001;
  t-test). (C,D) GFP signal in DR5::GFP transgenic lines of WT (C) and elp1 mutants
  (D). GFP signals are significantly detected in pulvinus of WT but not in elp1 mutants.
  (E,F) M. truncatula wild-type (R108) plants treated without (E) or with 250 µM yucasin
  (F), a specific chemical inhibitor of YUCCA protein, for 4 weeks were photographed.
  (G,H) Partially magnified view of pulvinus corresponding to (D,E), respectively.
  (I,J) Scanning electron microscope images of a pulvinus corresponding to (G,H),
  respectively. Scale bars: (C–F) 0.5 mm; (G,H) 2 mm, (I,J) 10 µm.'
