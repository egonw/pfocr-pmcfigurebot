caption: Graphene-based materials possess great potential to facilitate bone regeneration
  in dentistry. (A) Graphene-based materials (e.g., GO and lysozyme (GO/Lys)8 films
  on Ti substrate, GO coated Ti substrate) induce PDLSC proliferation and osteogenic
  differentiation in vitro. (B) Implantation of the GO–3D collogen sponge-form scaffold
  (GO–scaffold) in the tooth extraction socket enhances the formation of new bone.
  (C) Ti implants with MH-loaded GO films (MH/GO/Ti) show good therapeutic effects
  for peri-implantitis and can prevent its further development in beagle dogs, exhibiting
  a significantly reduced modified sulcus bleeding index, marginal bone loss and peri-implant
  probing pocket depth, and many osteocytes but almost no neutrophils. (D) GO coating
  on the Ti surface facilitates bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell osteogenic
  differentiation by activating intracellular FAK and its downstream MAPK/P38 signaling
  pathway to upregulate the expression of genes associated with osteogenesis (such
  as ALP, OPN, RUNX2 and OCN) and enhance bone-implant osseointegration in vivo. The
  loading of dexamethasone (DEX) (DEX/GO/Ti), bone morphogenetic protein 2 and/or
  substance P (BMP-2/SP/GO/Ti) can enhance the above effects. The black arrow indicates
  promote; the red arrow indicates upregulation. PDLSCs, periodontal ligament stem
  cells; MH, minocycline hydrochloride; FAK, focal adhesion kinase.
