caption: EFEMP1 targeted STEAP1 to promote TGF-β/Smad2/3 pathway and induce EMT to
  increase the invasion ability of osteosarcoma cells. (A) Using 2 ng/ml human recombinant
  TGF-β in the control group and the STEAP1 down-expression group for 24 h, STEAP1
  knockdown significantly inhibited the expression and phosphorylation of Smad2/3,
  and TGF-β increased the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 in control cells, but has no
  obvious effect on STEAP1 down-expression group. (B) Transwell invasion assay showed
  that TGF-β significantly increased the invasion ability of cells in the control
  group, but had no effect on STEAP2 down-expression group. (C) Exogenous EFEMP1 increased
  the expression of STEAP1 and promoted the expression and phosphorylation of Smad2/3
  in low invasive HOS-29 osteosarcoma cells in a quantity-dependent manner. (D) STEAP1
  knockdown inhibited EFEMP1 activation of TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling pathway. (E) Transwell
  invasion assay showed that EFEMP1 significantly increased the invasion ability of
  cells in the control group, but had no significant impact in the STEAP1 down-regulated
  group.
