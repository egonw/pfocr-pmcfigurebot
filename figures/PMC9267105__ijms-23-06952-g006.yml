caption: Activation of inflammatory NF-κB signaling pathway in mononuclear cells (MNCs)
  of peripheral blood of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Activation of NF-κB signaling
  in (A) MNCs and CD19+ cells of CLL (n = 3); (B) MNCs treated 1 h by 20 µg/mL IL-6
  with and without 0.6 nM Ruxolitinib, 5 nM LY294002, and 0.75 nM JSH23; (C) MNCs
  treated 1 h by 30 µg/mL IL-10 with and without 1.2 nM Ruxolitinib, 10 nM PI3K inhibitor,
  and 1.5 nM NF-κB inhibitor JSH23. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 5). * p <
  0.05, versus IL-6 or IL-10 treated MNCs.
