caption: 'The KIF4 mutation affects TrkB signaling through suppression of PARP1 activity.
  (A–D) Hippocampal culture neurons are cultured under 5 μm Arac condition. Immunoblotting
  of the hippocampal culture neuron lysates (DIV 18) using the indicated antibodies
  (A) and the statistics of the expression ratios (B–D). The expression ratios of
  TrkB FL (B), TrkB p705 (C), and KCC2 (D) are represented. Quantification of individual
  protein bands with reference to actin control bands. Data are presented as mean
  ± SEM (n = 6, three independent experiments). n.s., P > 0.5, ***P < 0.001, ****P
  < 0.0001 (two-way ANOVA). (E–I) Immunoblotting of the hippocampal culture neuron
  lysates (DIV 18) using the indicated antibodies (E) and the statistics of the expression
  ratio (F–I). The expression ratios of TrkB FL (F), TrkB T1 (G), PAR (H), and KCC2
  (I) are represented. Quantification of individual protein bands with reference to
  tubulin and actin control bands. Data are presented as mean ± SEM (n = 6, three
  independent experiments). n.s., P > 0.5, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001
  (two-way ANOVA). (J–K) Immunocytochemistry of primary neurons using the indicated
  antibodies, and IgG (J) and the statistics of the fluorescence density (K); Scale
  bar, 10 μm. Data are presented as mean ± SEM (n = 20, 4 independent experiments).
  **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001 (two-way ANOVA). Source data are available for this figure:
