caption: 'Effect of ANTXR1 on the expression of key molecules of the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway. (a) The mRNA expression levels of LRP6, β-catenin, c-Jun, and cyclin D1
  were detected by qRT-PCR after overexpression of ANTXR1 in K562 cells. (b) The mRNA
  expression levels of LRP6, β-catenin, c-Jun, and cyclin D1 were detected by qRT-PCR,
  after K562 cells were transfected with ANTXR1-sh5. (c) The protein levels of LRP6,
  β-catenin, c-Jun, and cyclin D1 were measured by western blotting after K562 cells
  were overexpressed or knocked down by ANTXR1. (d, e) Quantification of the western
  blots is shown in (c). (f, g) The mRNA and protein expression levels of γ-globin,
  LRP6, β-catenin, c-Jun, and cyclin D1 were detected by qRT-PCR and western blotting,
  respectively, with K562 cells overexpressing ANTXR1 treated with 2.5, 5, and 10 μmol/L
  of XAV939 for 24 h. (h) Quantification of the western blots shown in (g). (i, j)
  The mRNA and protein expression levels of γ-globin, LRP6, β-catenin, c-Jun, and
  cyclin D1 were detected by qRT-PCR and western blotting, respectively, with K562
  cells interfering with ANTXR1-sh5 which were treated with 5, 20, and 40 mmol/L of
  LiCl for 24 h. (k) Quantification of the western blots shown in (j). These experiments
  n = 3. The error bar represents the SD. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01. NC: negative control.'
