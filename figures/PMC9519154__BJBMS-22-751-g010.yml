caption: 'Network connection diagram of 10 pathways and their crosstalk genes. The
  blue diamond nodes represent different pathways, and the size of the nodes represents
  the score of the pathway in PAGI. The circular node connected to the blue diamond
  node represents the genes included in the pathways. The shade of the color represents
  the level of the gene’s GDS score. The darker the node’s color, the higher the GDS
  score represents the gene. hsa04141: Protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum.
  hsa04210: Apoptosis. hsa05010: Alzheimer’s disease. hsa04150: mTOR signaling pathway.
  hsa04910: Insulin signaling pathway. hsa04722: Neurotrophin signaling pathway. hsa04144:
  Endocytosis. hsa04930: Type II diabetes mellitus. hsa04020: Calcium signaling.'
