caption: 'KEGG Mapper Tool Analysis. This figure represents the neurotrophin signaling
  pathway after tDCS (coral: upregulation, blue: downregulation). Compared with the
  control group, the upregulated genes in the stimulation group after tDCS were SOS,
  Raf, PI3K, Rac1, IRAK, and Bax (p < 0.05). Compared with the control group, the
  downregulated genes in the stimulation group after tDCS were CHK, Crk, Rap1, p38,
  Ras, and NF-kB (p < 0.05).'
