figure_title: Effects of long‐term exposure to PM2.5 on cell proliferation and anchorage‐independent
  growth of PC9 lung cancer cells
caption: A, BPC9 cells were treated with PM2.5 at 50 μg/ml for 60 days. The proliferation
  of treated cells was assessed by Trypan blue assay (A). The anchorage‐independent
  growth was assessed by a soft agar colony formation assay (B). The data shown are
  the means ± SDs from three independent experiments. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01, compared
  with untreated cells. (A) P‐values were determined by two‐sample t‐test. (B) P‐values
  were determined by one‐sample t‐test.  Source data are available online for this
  figure.
