caption: 'The possible regulatory mechanism of AbrB in C. tyrobutyricum ATCC 25755.
  Sugar uptake and products production: The utilization of xylose or mannose was repressed
  while the utilization of mannitol was enhanced when fermentation occurred with a
  sole carbon source. AbrB could regulate products distribution when mannitol was
  used as the carbon source. Sporulation and Lipid synthesis: AbrB repressed sporulation
  by binding to the promoter regions of sigH and spo0A. After abrB knockout, the expression
  of sigH and spo0A was up-regulated significantly. Meanwhile, abrB deletion alleviated
  the inhibition of the lipid synthesis pathway and provided raw materials for the
  synthesis of new cell membranes during asymmetric division and forespore engulfment;
  Biofilm formation: AbrB directly promoted biofilm formation and improved the tolerance
  of C. tyrobutyricum to adverse environments.'
