figure_title: Model illustrating how glucose and ethylene signaling regulates sink
  root growth of Arabidopsis plants by controlling sucrose phloem loading
caption: Sink root growth is promoted by the glucose signaling-HXK1-EIN3-SUC2 pathway,
  whereas sink root growth is inhibited by the ethylene signaling-EIN3-SUC2 pathway.
  The ethylene-EIN3 is ethylene canonical signal transduction pathway, which comprises
  the ethylene receptors ETR1, CTR1, EIN2, EIN3, and EIL1. The HXK1-EIN3 comprises
  that the regulation is via regulation of ubiquitination and proteolysis. Arrows
  and bars represent positive and negative regulation, respectively.

  growth by the EIN3-SUC2 module.
