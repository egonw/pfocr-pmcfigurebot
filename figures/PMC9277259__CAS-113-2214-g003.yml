caption: Poly(ADP‐ribose)polymerase (PARP) inhibitor‐driven synthetic lethality in
  the contexts of DNA damage repair deficiencies. PARP inhibitors repress single‐strand
  break (SSB) repair and base excision repair, as well as TMEJ. While normal cells
  can repair the resulting double‐strand breaks (DSBs) via the error‐free HR pathway,
  HR‐deficient cells (e.g., BRCA1/2‐deficient cells) cannot escape from these deleterious
  effects. In BRCA2‐deficient cells, high dependency on SSA is lethal because this
  repair system is error prone and causes cell catastrophe. The PARP trapping activity,
  which is the most marked for talazoparib and the weakest for veliparib, also leads
  to DNA damage and yields therapeutic efficacies
