caption: RNF128 promotes cell migration and invasion in colorectal cancer. (A, C,
  D) The migration abilities of LoVo and HCT116 cells were analyzed by transwell assays
  and wound healing assays with si-NC and si-RNF128 transfection. (B) The invasion
  abilities of LoVo and HCT116 cells transfected with si-NC and si-RNF128 were observed
  by transwell assays with Matrigel. **P<0.001.
article_title: Ring finger protein 128 promotes, rather than inhibits, colorectal
  cancer progression by regulating the Hippo signaling pathway.
