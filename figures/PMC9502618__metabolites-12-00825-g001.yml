caption: Effect of FFA treatment for 24 h on glycolipid metabolism-related indexes
  in primary hepatocytes of laying hens. (A) Cells from each experimental group were
  stained with Oil Red O. (B) Cells from each experimental group were stained with
  PAS. The scale bar represents 50 μm (C) Cellular triglyceride levels of each experimental
  group. (D) A total cholesterol level of cells in each experimental group. (E) Levels
  of cell supernatant glucose. Data are shown as the mean ± SD (n = 6), with (**)
  p < 0.01.
