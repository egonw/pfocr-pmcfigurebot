caption: Expression of miRNA in cBMDM-sEVs and nBMDM-sEVs. (A) Heatmap analysis of
  miRNA in cBMDM-sEVs and nBMDM-sEVs (n = 3). (B) Volcano plot of differentially expressed
  miRNA between cBMDM-sEVs and nBMDM-sEVs. (C) KEGG pathway analyses of differentially
  expressed miRNA between cBMDM-sEVs and nBMDM-sEVs. (D) GO analyses of differentially
  expressed miRNA between cBMDM-sEVs and nBMDM-sEVs. (E) mRNA expression of miR-146a-5p,
  miR-100-5p, miR-27a-3p, and let-7a-5p in cBMDM-sEVs and nBMDM-sEVs by qRT-PCR. (F)
  mRNA expression of miR-146a-5p and miR-100-5p in RA-FLS co-cultured with PBS, cBMDM-sEVs
  or nBMDM-sEVs, respectively. Data are presented as mean ± SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001
