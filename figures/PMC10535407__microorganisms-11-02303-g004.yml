caption: Determination of glucose metabolic pathway and transcriptional intensity.
  (A) Identification of glucose metabolic pathway (glycolysis pathway and pentose
  phosphate pathway). The pentose phosphate pathway has a blue border, and the pentose
  phosphate pathway has a red border. (B–E) Determination of transcriptional intensity
  of glucose metabolic pathway in 6 h, 9 h, 24 h and 27 h. (F) The detection of intracellular
  glucose content in different time periods showed that blue was primitive bacteria
  and orange was Bacillus licheniformis CA. Statistical comparisons were performed
  using two-sided Student’s t-test (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01).
