caption: Knockdown of GINS2 suppresses cell proliferation and induces cell cycle arrest
  of HCC cells in vitro. A. CCK-8 assay was performed in 97H and LM3 cells transfected
  with sh-NC or sh-GINS2. B. Cell proliferation was further examined in sh-NC and
  sh-GINS2 cells by EdU assay. C. The effect of GINS2 on colony-forming ability was
  detected by colony formation assay in 97H and LM3 cells after transfection. D. Flow
  cytometry results show the cell cycle distribution of GINS2 silenced 97H and LM3
  cells. All data are represented as mean Â± S.E.M. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
