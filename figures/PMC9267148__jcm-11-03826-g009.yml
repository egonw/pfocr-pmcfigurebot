caption: The interactive 3D viewer illustrating the highest Vina score of binding
  mode and representative positions of proteinâ€“ligand docking at their pocket binding
  sites. Blue cartoon ribbons represent (a) CIAPIN1 protein interface to the NOS1
  (ball and stick) and (b) SMAD2 protein interface to the NOS1 (ball and stick). Interaction
  bond is presented by the dashed line.
