caption: 'Western blot analysis of p53 pathway protein. (a) Post addition of different
  4,7-didehydro-neophysalin B concentrations, p53 pathway-related protein expression
  in RLE-6TN cells and their quantitative band intensity analysis. (b) Effect of 4,7-didehydro-neophysalin
  B on the expression of p53 pathway-related proteins and the quantitative band intensity
  analysis. Compared with the blank group, ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01, and with the
  H2O2+0% 4,7-didehydro-neophysalin B group, #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01.'
