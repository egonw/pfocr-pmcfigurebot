figure_title: Lack of B7-H3 alters the transcriptional program of APs
caption: (A to C) RNA-seq was performed on APs purified by FACS from gWAT of age-
  and weight-matched WT (n = 2) and B7-H3 KO (n = 2) mice. For each sample, gWAT was
  pooled from three mice before enzymatic digestion, staining, sorting, and RNA purification.
  (A) Heatmap of DEGs (>2-fold) between WT and B7-H3 KO APs. (B and C) Pathway and
  gene sets enriched in genes down-regulated in B7-H3 KO compared to WT APs. GSEA
  was performed to identify KEGG, Hallmark, and GO-BP sets that were significantly
  enriched (false discovery rate < 0.05) for genes down-regulated in B7-H3 KO APs.
  Top 10 pathways (B) and selected metabolic gene sets (C) are listed and ranked on
  the basis of normalized enrichment score.
