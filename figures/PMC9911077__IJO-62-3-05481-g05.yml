caption: α-hederin overcomes hypoxia-mediated resistance by reducing Bcl2 and Bcl-xL
  expression in PDX mouse models. (A) Immunohistochemical analysis of HIF-1α and anti-apoptotic
  proteins in clinical tissue samples. (B) Immunohistochemical score was used to analyse
  the correlation between HIF-1α expression and anti-apoptotic protein expression.
  (C) The relationship between HIF-1α expression levels and immunohistochemical score
  of anti-apoptotic proteins is shown. (D and E) PDX growth curves in mice. (F and
  G) Images and weights of tumours. RT-qPCR was used to measure the expression levels
  of Bcl2 and Bcl-xL in tissues. Representative images of IHC of Ki67, Bcl2, Bcl-xL,
  p-AKT and HIF-1α in tissues and evaluation of apoptosis in each group by TUNEL.
  Scale bars, 50 µm. Data are presented as the mean ± SD. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 vs. vehicle
  or as indicated. IHC, immunohistochemistry; PDX, patient-derived xenograft.
