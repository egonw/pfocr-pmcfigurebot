caption: 'Part A: Curcumin inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of cancer
  cells through miRNA and lncRNA-mediated mechanisms. Part B: Curcumin-mediated autophagy
  of cancer cells. Curcumin may inhibit the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway to activate
  the autophagy marker Beclin-1, which induces apoptosis via inhibition of Bcl-2 and
  promotes the formation of autophagosomes from the free phagophores, inducing autophagy.
  Curcumin can also activate the MAPK/ERK and AMPK signaling pathways or LC3 to induce
  autophagy via an LC3-II-mediated mechanism. Part C: Inhibition of angiogenesis by
  curcumin. Curcumin can inhibit the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells and
  smooth muscle cells through COX-2/PGE2, TGF-β1-, bFGF- and PDGF-mediated mechanisms.
  Curcumin can also inhibit the angiogenic mimicry of cancer cells and mosaic blood
  vessel formation in co-cultures of cancer cells and vascular endothelial cells.
  Part D: Re-sensitization of radioresistant cancer cells by curcumin. Curcumin can
  increase oxygen content through upregulation of ROS or downregulation of HIF-1α,
  inhibit DNA repair and promote cancer cell arrest at G2/M through the miRNA-1246-mediated
  p53 pathway.'
