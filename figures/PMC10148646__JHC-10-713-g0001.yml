caption: Molecular interactions and oncogenic mechanisms occurring in the HCC microenvironment
  associated with chronic HBV-HDV infection. Both immune cell impairment and stimulation
  of pro-oncogenic intracellular signaling pathways are involved in CHB- and CDH-driven
  hepatocarcinogenesis. Through the release of TGF-β and IL-10, M2 macrophages, MDSCs
  and tumor cells inhibit the antitumor functions of immune effector cells, promoting
  tumor immune escape. HBx upregulates Wnt/β-catenin signaling and promotes survivin
  protein synthesis, supporting tumor cell proliferation and preventing apoptosis.
  Synergistically, L-HDAg and HBx trigger the JNK/c-Jun and SRE/c-fos cascades, both
  of which are involved in cancer cell growth, proliferation and survival. The integration
  of HBV-DNA into the host genome and the overproduction of ROS, triggered by HBx,
  L-HDAg and S-HDAg, promote DNA damage and genomic instability. ROS also promote
  cancer cell survival, angiogenesis and invasiveness through upregulation of the
  NF-ĸB pathway, which is also stimulated by L-HDAg in a TNFα-dependent manner, and
  STAT-3 signaling, which is further activated by Th17 (via IL-22), pre-malignant
  cells and Kupffer cells (via IL-6). Image created with Biorender.com.
