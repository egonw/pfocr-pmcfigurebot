caption: Schematic diagram depicting ketamine administration-induced anti-inflammation
  and anti-oxidative effects on PND after tibial fracture surgery, which may be mediated
  by the TRPV4/AMPK/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway. PND, perioperative neurocognitive disorder;
  TRPV4, transient receptor potential vanilloid 4; AMPK, adenosine monophosphate-activated
  protein kinase.
article_title: Ketamine administration ameliorates anesthesia and surgery-induced
  cognitive dysfunction via activation of TRPV4 channel opening.
