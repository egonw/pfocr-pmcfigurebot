caption: 'PcActx-induced Nrf2 activation and Aβ downregulation were mediated by the
  Akt/Gsk3β pathway. (a–c) PcActx peptide promoted the phosphorylation of Akt (Ser
  473) and Gsk3β (Ser 9). (d–h) An Akt inhibitor suppressed the PcActx-induced upregulation
  of Nrf2, NQO1, and HO-1, as well as the downregulation of Keap1. (i, j) The reductions
  of APP, Aβ 1-40, and Aβ1-42 were counteracted by pharmacological inhibition of Akt/Gsk3β
  signaling. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD of three or four independent experiments,
  in triplicate. #p < 0.05 vs. N2a/APP group and ##p < 0.01 vs. N2a/APP group. ∗p
  < 0.05 vs. PcActx-treated group and ∗∗p < 0.01 vs. PcActx-treated group.'
