figure_title: Sorting of GluA1 homomers is a general feature of ANTH domain–containing
  proteins and involves ubiquitin
caption: (A) CALM-ANTH binds ubiquitin. GST-ubiquitin or GST was incubated with His-WT-CALM-ANTH
  or its ubiquitin binding–deficient mutant. Analysis by immunoblotting. (B) Ubiquitination
  and CALM-dependent GluA1 sorting act in the same pathway. Neuronal surface/total
  protein ratios of SEP-GluA1-WT or its ubiquitination-deficient K868R mutant. (C)
  Ubiquitin binding–deficient CALM mutant cannot rescue increased GluA1 surface pool
  of CALM KOCAG neurons. Surface/total SEP-GluA1 protein ratios in KOCAG neurons coexpressing
  ubiquitin binding–deficient CALM mutant. (D) Tryptic synaptosome digest indicates
  postsynaptic HIP1/HIP1R localization. Digested synaptosomes were analyzed by immunoblotting
  (trypsin-treated samples normalized to untreated controls). (E) Coimmunoprecipitation
  of HIP1R-GluA1 complex from synaptosomal membranes using HIP1R-specific antibodies.
  (F and G) ANTH domain–containing proteins bind GluA1. GST-ANTH domains of CALM (F),
  HIP1, HIP1R, or GST-Epsin1-ENTH (G) were incubated with brain lysate. Analysis by
  immunoblotting. (H) HIP1/HIP1R-ANTH domains, but not Epsin1-ENTH-domain, bind ubiquitin.
  GST-ubiquitin or GST was incubated with His-tagged proteins. Analysis by immunoblotting.
  (I) Loss of HIP1 and HIP1R causes GluA1 surface accumulation, especially when combined
  with CALM deletion. Surface/total SEP-GluA1 protein ratios in neurons treated with
  control or HIP1- or HIP1R-specific siRNAs. (J) GluA1 surface accumulation upon CALM
  loss is rescued by overexpression of HIP1 or HIP1R. Surface/total SEP-GluA1 protein
  ratios in neurons transfected with pcDNA3.1 (=control), HIP1-Myc/His, or HIP1R-3xHA.
  (K) Endocytic platform of HIP1, HIP1R, and CALM fulfils overlapping cargo-specific
  role in endocytosis of ubiquitinated GluA1 homomers. Statistics .
