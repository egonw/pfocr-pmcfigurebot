caption: 'High glucose-induced SC-derived exosomes inhibited the neurite outgrowth
  of NG108-15 cells in high glucose(A) Expression of AKT1, DNMT3A, and GAP43 in NG108-15
  was detected by PCR, and AKT signaling pathway and neurite outgrowth-related factors
  (DNMT3A and GAP43) were inhibited in NG108-15 cells treated with H-EXO compared
  to L-EXO (n = 10 samples; t-test: ∗∗∗p < 0.001 versus the L-EXO group).(B and C)
  Western blot (B) was used to detect the protein expression of p-AKT, t-AKT, DNMT3A,
  and GAP43 in NG108-15 cells, the results had the same trend as the PCR results.
  (C) Gray value statistics of Western blot (n = 4 samples, nonparametric tests: ∗p < 0.05
  of p-AKT/AKT, Bcl2/Bax and C-cas3/GAPDH versus the L-EXO group).(D and E) Immunocytochemistry
  staining (D) of beta III Tubulin (red) to observe neurite outgrowth, H-EXO significantly
  reduced neurite outgrowth in NG108-15 cells compared to L-EXO. Scale bar: 25 μm.
  (E) Neurite length quantification (n = 10 fields of view per group, t-test: ∗∗∗p < 0.001
  versus the L-EXO group). For the above, data are represented as mean ± SD.'
