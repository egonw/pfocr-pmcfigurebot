caption: The JNK signaling pathway participated in snake venom-induced autophagy.
  (A and B) SW480 cells were treated with snake venom (0.5, 1 μg/ml) or 0.5 μM Rapamycin
  for 24 h. The indicated protein levels were evaluated by immunoblotting. (C) SW480
  cells were treated with snake venom (0.5, 1 μg/ml) for 24 h. The indicated protein
  levels were evaluated by immunoblotting. (D) SW480 cells were treated with 1 μg/ml
  snake venom for 24 h in the absence or presence of JNK inhibitor SP600125 (20 μM)
  pretreated for 2 h. The LC3 levels were evaluated by immunoblotting (A) or immunocytochemistry
  (B). The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI.
