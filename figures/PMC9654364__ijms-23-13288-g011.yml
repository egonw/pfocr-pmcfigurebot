caption: Transcriptomic profile and metabolic profiles of the tocopherol biosynthetic
  pathway, including methyl erythritol (MEP) pathway (red), Shikimate (SK) pathway
  (green), and vitamin E core pathway (blue). Significant differences were found in
  the transcription level of IPI, GGPS, HPPD, and VTE3 in RDFR vs. WHFR, VTE4 in BLFR
  vs. WHFR, and VTE1, GGDR (101262299; >2 FC) and GGDR (101266160) in WHFR vs. other
  treatments. Red and blue rectangles indicate higher and lower levels, respectively,
  than the mean of all treatments. Values indicate the z-score in the legend. β-tocopherol
  (B) and α-tocopherol (C) concentrations in fruits treated with different light treatments.
  Values indicate the mean ± SE (n = 3). Different letters indicate significant differences
  at p < 0.05 by an independent t-test. BLFR, RDFR, and WHFR refer to blue, red, and
  white light-treated fruits, respectively.
