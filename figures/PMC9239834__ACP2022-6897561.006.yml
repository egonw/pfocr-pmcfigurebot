caption: 'Silencing of p53 reverses the effects of UPK3A knockdown in gastric cancer
  cells. (a) The expression of p53 in SNU-216 and HGC-27 cells was detected by qRT-PCR
  and Western blot assay. (b) The protein expression of p-p53, KLF4, ZMAT3, MDM2,
  and SP1 in SNU-216 and HGC-27 cells was detected by Western blot assay. (c) The
  cell activity of SNU-216 and HGC-27 cells was analyzed by MTT assay. (d) The cell
  proliferation of SNU-216 and HGC-27 cells was analyzed by colony formation assay.
  (e) The cell migration of SNU-216 and HGC-27 cells was detected by wound healing
  assay. (f) The cell invasion of SNU-216 was measured by Transwell assay. ∗∗P < 0.01
  vs. si-NC group; ##P < 0.01 vs. si-UPK3A#2 group.'
