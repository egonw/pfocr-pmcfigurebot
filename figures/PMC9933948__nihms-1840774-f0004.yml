figure_title: Selective downregulation of FAO gene sets upon genetic deletion of Mcl-1
  in murine B-ALL cells and liver tissue
caption: (A and B) Volcano plot depictions of comparative FAO gene expression in DKO
  and TKO cells cultured in regular (A) and low-glucose (B) media for 24 h. Data are
  the mean of three technical replicates. Genes with statistically significant changes
  based on the Wald test, with correction for multiple hypothesis testing using the
  Benjamini-Hochberg method, are shown in dark gray.(C and D) Volcano plot depictions
  of comparative expression changes of OXPHOS (C) and TCA cycle (D) gene sets in DKO
  and TKO cells cultured in regular medium. Data are the mean of three technical replicates.
  Genes with statistically significant changes based on the Wald test, with correction
  for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method, are shown in
  dark gray.(E) Volcano plot depiction of comparative gene expression changes in wild-type
  (WT) versus Mcl-1−/− murine livers, as determined by RNA-seq. Mcl-1 and FAO-related
  genes are shown in black and teal, respectively.(F) Downregulation of FAO and PPAR
  signaling pathway gene sets (teal) upon deletion of Mcl-1 in murine liver.See also  and
