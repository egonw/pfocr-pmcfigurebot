figure_title: Additional metabolic characterization of male and female PTER-KO mice
  on high fat diet and taurine-supplemented water. Related to
caption: (a) Human genetic evidence (HuGE) score of phenotype associations for the
  PTER gene locus from the Type 2 Diabetes Knowledge Portal.(b,c) Body weight (b)
  and food intake (c) of 12- to 13-week-old male PTER-KO mice (N=10, blue line) or
  WT mice (N=14, orange line) subjected to a high-fat diet feeding alone for a period
  of 8 weeks.(d-j) Metabolic chamber analysis of 12- to 13-week-old-male WT or PTER-KO
  mice after 8 weeks of high fat diet/taurine water supplementation (2.5% w/v). N=8/group.
  RER, respiratory exchange ratio.(k-p) Body weight (k), change in body weight (l),
  cumulative food intake (m), and water intake (n), tissue weights (o) and representative
  adipose tissues (p) of 13- to 14-week-old female WT or PTER-KO mice on high fat
  diet and after taurine water supplementation (2.5% w/v). N=10/group. iWAT, inguinal
  white adipose tissue; eWAT, epididymal white adipose tissue; BAT, brown adipose
  tissue; Quad, quadricep muscles.Data are shown as mean ± SEM. In (b,c) and (k-n),
  P-values were calculated from two-way ANOVA with post hoc Sidak’s multiple comparisons
  test. In (d-j) and (o), P-values were calculated from two-tailed unpaired t-tests.
