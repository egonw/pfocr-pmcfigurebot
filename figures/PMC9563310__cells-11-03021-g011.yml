caption: Metformin mitigated age-associated increase of ROS with enhanced expression
  of Nrf2, Bmal1 and antioxidant genes, such as Prdx6 in aging hLECs of both sexes.
  Primary hLECs isolated from different ages of male and female subjects were treated
  with 1mM of Metformin for 24 h. (A) Total intracellular ROS levels were measured
  using H2-DCF DA dye method. All histograms are presented as mean ± S.D. from three
  independent experiments. Young vs. aging hLECs and Untreated vs. Metformin-treated;
  * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.001. (B–D) Total RNA was isolated and proceeded for RT-qPCR
  with specific primers of the above-mentioned molecules. Metformin significantly
  increased the Bmal1 (B), Nrf2 (C) and antioxidant gene, Prdx6 (D) expression levels
  in aging hLECs of both sexes. The data represent the mean ± S.D. from three independent
  experiments. Young vs. aging hLECs and Untreated vs. Metformin-treated; * p < 0.05;
  ** p < 0.001.
