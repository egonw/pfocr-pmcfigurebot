caption: 'Identification of immune‐related methylation patterns (IMPs) in osteosarcoma
  and immune infiltration characteristics of different IMPs. (A) An unsupervised consensus
  clustering (k = 3) of Methylation beta value matrix of these immune‐related CpG
  sites in the TARGET OS cohort. (B) Kaplan–Meier analysis reveals distinct overall
  survival of the three IMPs (log‐rank test, n = 84). (C) Histological response to
  chemotherapy (Stages 1/2 and 3/4) of patients with OS among three IMPs (chi‐square
  test, n = 42). (D) Metastasis at diagnosis of patients with OS among three IMPs
  (chi‐square test, n = 84). (E) Relative proportion of immune infiltrating cells
  patients with OS of three IMPs and infiltrating scores of each type of immune infiltrating
  cells analyzed by CIBERSORTx (Kruskal–Wallis test, n = 83). Boxplot displaying the
  data distribution: the lower and upper hinges represent the first and third quartiles,
  the upper/lower whiskers extend from the corresponding hinges to the largest/smallest
  values at most 1.5 * interquartile range from the hinges. Data beyond the end of
  the whiskers are considered outliers and are not shown. (F) Heatmaps of GSVA enrichment
  scores (z‐score) of hallmark, GO biological process and Reactome pathway gene sets
  in relation to TME in different IMPs.'
