caption: 'RUNX2 multi‐layered hierarchical network. (A) Work‐flow of the pipeline
  used to identify RUNX2 regulative elements (REs) and their putative target genes
  and TF cooperators. (B) Schematic representation of ChIP‐seq profile integration
  and target gene prediction. (C) Ranking of super‐enhancers and classical enhancers
  based on their input‐normalized H3K27ac signal intensity in stitched regions performed
  by ROSE. (D) Distribution of RUNX2 putative TF cooperators identified by FIMO search
  is associated with predicted S‐ENHs in TPC1 cells. (E) Schematic representation
  of the hierarchical model backbone highlighting each functional layer. (F) Final
  hierarchical model of the reconstructed RUNX2 transcriptional landscape. The integration
  of different omics information allowed to stratify the RUNX2 regulative network.
  The node composition of each layer is shown in the legend. The transcriptional flow
  converged on target genes (layer 3) whose expression similarity assessed using a
  weighted correlation analysis is represented by different colored modules. The biological
  importance of each cluster was assessed by GO analysis using an FDR < 0.05 as the
  significance threshold. The number of genes and the major GO macro‐category are
  indicated above each module. N/S indicates that no significant pathway (FDR < 0.05)
  was detected for the considered module. (G) Correlation heatmap between eigengenes
  in each module and patients’ clinical features. Scale bar indicates correlation
  as expressed by R2 values. *P < 0.05, (**P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001. (H) Ranking of
  the top 5% TF model nodes identified as the bottleneck with a topological network
  analysis. The TF functional categories are represented with a binary color scale.
  (I Western blotting showing the RUNX2 KD mediated by CRISPR‐interference in the
  indicated cell lines. (J) Intersection of RUNX2‐network module genes with RNA‐seq
  profile. The histogram represents the percentage of deregulated genes in each module.
  (K) Top GO categories of deregulated gene modules ranked by enrichment significance
  (P value adjusted by Benjamini‐Hochberg correction for multiple tests). Abbreviations:
