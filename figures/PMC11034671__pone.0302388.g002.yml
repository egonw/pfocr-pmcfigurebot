figure_title: Global gene expression changes across salmon life-stage
caption: A) Relative liver expression of genes differentially expressed between any
  time point in the fish cohort that experienced short photoperiod fish followed by
  seawater transfer (FDR <0.05). Scaled expression is denoted as gene-scaled transcripts
  per million. Genes were partitioned into seven co-expression clusters by hierarchical
  clustering. Colored bars indicate cluster membership when correlation to the mean
  cluster pattern was >0.5. Genes with correlation = <0.5 were excluded. B) Gene expression
  trends over time by cluster. Colored line indicates mean relative expression while
  grey lines are individual genes within the cluster. C) KEGG pathway enrichment by
  cluster. Colored diamonds indicate for pathways which clusters they are significantly
  enriched in (adjusted p <0.05). Colored bars indicate the proportion of genes within
  the pathways that are in clusters.
