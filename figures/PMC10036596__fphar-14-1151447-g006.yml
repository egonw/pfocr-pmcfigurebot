caption: Bubble diagram of KEGG metabolic pathway enrichment analysis of significantly
  different metabolites (A, B) and (C), and signal pathway enrichment analysis of
  components absorbed into the blood (D). (A) Low-dose group vs. Control group, (B)
  High-dose group vs. Control group, (C) High-dose group vs. Low-dose group. The horizontal
  axis represents the rich factor, and the vertical axis represents the pathways.
  The bubble size represents the number of targets in the pathway. The bubble color
  indicates the magnitude of the -log10(p) values.
article_title: Pharmacological activities and effective substances of the component-based
  Chinese medicine of Ginkgo biloba leaves based on serum pharmacochemistry, metabonomics
  and network pharmacology.
