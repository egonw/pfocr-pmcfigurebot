caption: BTC is both necessary and sufficient to stimulate EGFR signaling(A) NIH3T3
  cells expressing either empty vector or the V5-tagged BTC ORF were analyzed for
  the indicated proteins by immunoblotting. ACTB was used as a loading control.(B)
  HSAEC1-KT cells expressing either empty vector or the V5-tagged BTC ORF were analyzed
  for the indicated proteins by immunoblotting. ACTB was used as a loading control.(C)
  PC9 cells expressing either a non-silencing shRNA or BTC shRNA were analyzed for
  indicated proteins by immunoblotting. ACTB was used as a loading control.(D) HCC2935
  cells expressing either a non-silencing shRNA or BTC shRNA were analyzed for indicated
  proteins by immunoblotting. ACTB was used as a loading control.(E) Proteome Profiler
  Mouse Phospho-RTK Array membranes were incubated with lysates from NIH3T3 cells
  expressing either empty vector or V5-tagged BTC ORF. Array membranes incubated with
  lysates from vector or V5-tagged BTC ORF is shown.(F) Quantification of p-EGFR,
  p-ERBB2 and p-IGF1R for data shown in (E).(G) Proteome Profiler Human Phospho-RTK
  Array membranes showing relative RTK phosphorylation in PC9 cells expressing NS
  or BTC specific shRNAs is shown.(H) Quantification of p-EGFR, p-ERBB2 and p-ERBB3
  for data shown in panel (G). Data are shown as the mean Â±SEM See also  and .
