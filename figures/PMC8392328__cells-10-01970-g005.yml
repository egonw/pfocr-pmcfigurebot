caption: MYC/CXCL8/TIMP1 oncogenes co-occurred and contributed to functional relationships.
  (A) Signaling network analysis, showing that co-expressions of the MYC, IL10, TP53,
  CXCL8, TIMP1, and CDK2 genes were more enriched. (B) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
  showed that co-expressed genes exhibited enrichment in the thyroid hormone signaling
  pathway, bladder cancer, cellular senescence, cell cycle, and HTLC-1 infections.
