caption: LMNA regulation of cytoskeletal changes and nuclear deformability. Cytoskeletal
  F-actin was stained with rhodamine phalloidin (red). Nuclei were visualized using
  DAPI staining (blue). LaminA/C was determined by immunofluorescence assay (green).
  Representative pictures of fluorescent laminA/C, F-actin, and nuclei are shown.
  Scale bar = 100 μm.
