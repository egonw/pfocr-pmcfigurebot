caption: 'Effect of NDV-induced autophagy on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. A The
  mRNA transcription levels of NLRP3 in NDV-infected DF-1 cells. B Western blot analysis
  of NLRP3 protein expression in NDV-infected DF-1 cells treated with CQ or 3-MA.
  GAPDH was used as a protein loading control. The effect of NDV-induced autophagy
  on caspase-1 activation was examined in NDV-infected DF-1 cells treated with C CQ
  and 3-MA, D ATG16L1-specific siRNAs, and E rapamycin and starvation. Shown are the
  ratios of Caspase-1 activation, measured 30 h after NDV infection. Similar results
  were obtained from three independent experiments. Data were expressed as mean ± SD.
  *P ≤ 0.05; **P ≤ 0.01; ***P ≤ 0.001. NDV: Newcastle disease virus, CQ: chloroquine,
  3-MA: 3-Methyladenine, ATG16L1: autophagy-related protein 16 like protein 1, NLRP3:
  NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3.'
