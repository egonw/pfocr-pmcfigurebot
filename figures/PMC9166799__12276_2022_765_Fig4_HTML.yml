caption: a Full-length KARS1 consists of the N-Helix, ABD and CD Domains. KARS1 is
  modified to three different forms by different kinds of upstream enzymes. First,
  KARS1 is phosphorylated at T52 by p38 MAPK in the presence of laminin. KARS1 pT52
  is translocated to the plasma membrane for interaction with 67LR and then promotes
  metastasis. Second, KARS1 is phosphorylated at S207 upon EGFR signaling pathway
  activation. KARS1 pS207 is translocated to the nucleus and appears to be associated
  with disease-free survival of NSCLC. Third, the N-terminal 12 amino acid KARS1 is
  cleaved by caspase-8 to produce ΔKARS1. ΔKARS1 is secreted into the extracellular
  space in exosomes via interaction with syntenin. b Full-length MARS1 consists of
  GST, CD, ABD and WHEP domains. MARS1 is modified to two different forms of MARS1
  in response to various input signals. Upon UV irradiation, MARS1 is phosphorylated
  at S662 by GCN2. MARS1 pS662 has a decreased capability to methionylate tRNAs, resulting
  in downregulation of global translation. In contrast, MARS1 is doubly phosphorylated
  at S209 and S825 by ERK1/2 in response to oxidative stress. MARS1 pS209/825 shows
  increased mismethionylation to noncognate tRNAs due to an increase in Met residues
  in proteins, which contribute to reducing ROS levels. c Upon stimulation with IFN-γ,
  EPRS1 is phosphorylated at S886 and S999 by CDK5 and S6K1, respectively. EPRS1 pS886/999
  forms the GAIT complex to regulate translation of GAIT elements. d LARS1 is phosphorylated
  at S720 by ULK1 in response to glucose starvation. LARS1 S720 shows decreased leucine
  binding capability, resulting in decreased tRNA leucylation and mTORC1 stimulation.
  CD, catalytic domain; ABD, anticodon-binding domain; ROS, reactive oxygen species.
