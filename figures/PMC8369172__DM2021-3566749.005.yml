caption: The relationship between CRIP1 and EMT indicates that CRIP1 may function
  in ovarian cancer development via the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. (a) KEGG pathway enrichment
  analysis was performed to identify which pathway was significantly enriched in CRIP1-related
  ovarian cancer progression. (b) The effect of CRIP1 silencing on EMT-related signaling
  pathways. EMT markers, such as E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin proteins, were
  detected by western blot. (c) The effect of CRIP1 silencing on Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway. The important molecules of this pathway, including β-catenin, GSK-3β, p-GSK-3β,
  MMP2, and MMP9, were assessed by western blot.
