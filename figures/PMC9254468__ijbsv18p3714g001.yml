caption: SP-I suppressed NSCLC cell proliferation. (A) The purity and chemical structure
  of ISP-I. (B) Cell viabilities of H460 and A549 treated with various doses of ISP-I
  were assessed by CCK-8 in 96-well plates. (C) IC50 values of ISP-I in H460 and A549
  cells were determined after 48 h incubation by GraphPad Prism software. (D) Morphology
  and clonogenicity of H460 and A549 cells were visualized after crystal violet staining.
  Colonies were counted. (E) BEAS-2B were treated with varying doses of ISP-I at different
  durations. CCK-8 assay was performed for cell viability. (F) Morphology and number
  of BEAS-2B cells were observed under inverted microscope after 48h treatment with
  various dosages ISP-I. ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001.
