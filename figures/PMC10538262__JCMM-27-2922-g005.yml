caption: MTHFD2 promoted BC growth in vivo (A) Images of tumours in nude mice after
  subcutaneous injection with shNC or shMTHFD2 T24 cells. (B) Images of dissected
  tumours. (C, D) Tumour weight and volume. (E) Representative images of TUNEL staining
  and immunohistochemistry staining for PD‐L1 in different groups. (Scale bar represents
  100 μm) (F) WB analysis of MTHFD2, PD‐L1, cyclin D1, Bcl‐2, Bax and JAK/STAT signalling
  pathway‐related proteins expression in different groups. (** vs. shNC p < 0.01).
