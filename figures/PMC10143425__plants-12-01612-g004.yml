caption: Metabolome analysis of HS and ZFY. (a) Two-dimensional principal component
  analysis (2D PCA). PC1 denotes the first principal component and PC2 denotes the
  second principal component. This percentage indicates the explanation rate of the
  principal component of the dataset. (b) K-means analysis showing trends in the relative
  content of metabolites in different subgroups. The mean values of the relative contents
  of differential metabolites in each group were standardized using z-score and subjected
  to K-means clustering analysis. The horizontal coordinate indicates the name of
  the sample, the vertical coordinate indicates the relative content of standardized
  metabolites, the sub-class represents the number of metabolite classes with the
  same trend of change. (c) VIP score plot showing the results of differentially expressed
  metabolites with the top ranked VIP values in the OPLS-DA model for each group comparison.
  Horizontal coordinates indicate VIP values, vertical coordinates indicate differential
  metabolites, red represents upregulated differentially expressed metabolites and
  green represents downregulated differentially expressed metabolites. (d) KEGG pathway
  analysis of differential metabolites. The vertical coordinate is the name of the
  KEGG metabolic pathway and the horizontal coordinate is the number of metabolites
  annotated to that pathway and their number as a percentage of the total number of
  annotated metabolites.
