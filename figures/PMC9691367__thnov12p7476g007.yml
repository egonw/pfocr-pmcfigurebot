caption: SIAIS361034 has no impact on the platelet and bone growth. (A) Numeration
  of platelets, neutrophils, and red blood cells at 8 h and 24 h after a single i.p.
  injection with SIAIS361034 or p.o. dosing with ABT-263 at the indicated doses. Data
  represent mean ± SD (n = 3). (B) A representative western blot analysis of CRBN
  and VHL in different cell lines and solid tumors. GAPDH was used as a protein loading
  control. (C) Changes in body weight in mice after the start of treatment with vehicle,
  SIAIS361034, GDC-0449, and DT2216. Data represent mean ± SEM (n = 4). Red arrows
  indicate the treatment with drugs. (D) Photograph of 5-week-old mice after drug
  treatment from P12 to P16. (E) Micro-CT analyses of overall skeleton and femurs
  of 6-week-old mice. Vertical red lines indicate the length of the femur. Scale bars
  indicate 10 mm (up) and 5 mm (down). (F) Longitudinal cross-section Micro-CT images
  of the femurs (up). Regions of growth plate were represented by the red area (down).
  Scale bars indicate 500 µm. (G) H&E staining of longitudinal cross-sections of femurs.
  The boundary of the growth plate was represented by green dashed lines. Scale bars
  indicate 100 µm. (H) IHC staining of longitudinal cross-sections of femurs. Scale
  bars indicate 100 µm.
