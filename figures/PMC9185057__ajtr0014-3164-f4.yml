caption: 'Comparison of cell protein expression between groups. A: WB protein expression
  bands. B: The expression levels of p-PI3K in HT22 after hypoxia-reoxygenation were
  clearly lower than those in the control group (P<0.05). The expression levels of
  p-PI3K in cells treated with crocin were notably higher than those in OGD-group
  (P<0.05). C: The expression levels of p-Akt in HT22 after hypoxia-reoxygenation
  were clearly lower than those in the control group (P<0.05). The expression levels
  of p-Akt in cells treated with crocin were notably higher than those in OGD-group
  (P<0.05). D: The expression levels of p-mTOR in HT22 after hypoxia-reoxygenation
  were clearly lower than those in the control group (P<0.05). The expression levels
  of p-mTOR in cells treated with crocin were notably higher than those in OGD-group
  (P<0.05). E: The expression levels of LC-3 II/I after hypoxia-reoxygenation were
  clearly higher than those in the control group (P<0.05). The expression levels of
  LC-3 II/I in cells treated with crocin were notably lower than those in OGD-group
  (P<0.05). F: The expression levels of Beclin-1 after hypoxia-reoxygenation were
  clearly higher than those in the control group (P<0.05). The expression levels of
  Beclin-1 in cells treated with crocin were notably lower than those in OGD-group
  (P<0.05). Note: Compared with control group, *P<0.05; Compared with OGD group, #P<0.05;
  Compared with Low dose group, ΔP<0.05; Compared with Medium dose group, ○P<0.05.'
