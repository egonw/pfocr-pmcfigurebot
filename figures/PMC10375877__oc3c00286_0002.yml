caption: 'Interaction of Platin-L with CPT1A and its entry into the mitochondria.
  LNCaP cells (A) without cerulenin pretreatment and (B) with cerulenin pretreatment
  followed by etomoxir or Platin-L to check FAO inhibition efficacy. (C) OCR of Platin-L-
  or etomoxir-treated cells in the presence of palm:BSA with or without prior treatment
  with cerulenin. [Platin-L]: 10 μM for 24 h; [cerulenin]: 20 μM for 24 h. The concentration
  of free fatty acid [FFA] from palm-BSA was ∼4.3 nM. (D) CPT1A expression in cell
  lysate and immunoprecipitated CPT1A samples for control, cisplatin-, and Platin-L-treated
  groups for 6 h in PC3 cells by Western blot and the amount of Pt present in those
  immunoprecipitated CPT1A groups ([platin-L]: 50 μM and [cisplatin]: 50 μM). Statistical
  analysis was carried out using ordinary one-way ANOVA analyses with an α value of
  0.05. (E) Validation of CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout of the CPT1A gene in PC3 cells
  using Western blot data. (F) Amount of Pt present in the mitochondrial fraction
  of Platin-L- and cisplatin-treated PC3 cells at different time intervals with respect
  to protein. [Platin-L]: 50 μg/mL and [cisplatin]: 50 μg/mL. Statistical analyses
  were carried out using a two-way ANOVA analysis with an α value of 0.05. (G) Expressions
  of calnexin and TFAM in nuclear, mitochondrial, and cytosolic fractions of the control,
  cisplatin-, and Platin-L-treated PC3 cells. [Platin-L]: 50 μg/mL and [cisplatin]:
  50 μg/mL.'
