caption: Concomitant firing of both the follicular activation pathway and DDR. Chemotherapy
  triggers both the follicular activation pathway and DDR. A hallmark of the follicular
  activation cascade is FOXO3 phosphorylation. Akt-mediated phosphorylation promotes
  the export of FOXO3 to the cytoplasm. DDR is induced by DNAPK/ATR/ATM (c-Abl tyrosine
  kinase is also involved in their activation), which in turn can activate the CHK2-p53
  signaling cascade, promoting the transcription of PUMA and NOXA genes.
