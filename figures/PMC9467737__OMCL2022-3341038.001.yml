caption: Siglec-15 was expressed differently in M1 and M2 macrophages. (a) 20 ng/mL
  IL-4 was used to induce MФ into M2 type. The expression of the Siglec family in
  M2-type MФ was detected by qPCR. (b) Extract the total RNA of different tumor cells
  and TAMs and use qPCR assay to detect the expression level of Siglec-15. (c) Correlation
  analysis between the expression level of Siglec-15 and the overall survival (OS)
  of pancreatic tumors. (d) Siglec-15 transcription level of BMDMs stimulated by 100 ng/mL
  LPS and 20 ng/mL IFN-γ, or 20 ng/mL IL-4. (e) Siglec-15 protein level of BMDMs stimulated
  by 100 ng/mL LPS and 20 ng/mL IFN-γ, or 20 ng/mL IL-4. The experiments were repeated
  three times, and each experiment was triplicated.
