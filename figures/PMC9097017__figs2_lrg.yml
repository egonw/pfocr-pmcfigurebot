caption: RNA-seq analysis, related to (A) Heatmap showing the logCPM (log counts per
  million) values for clusters of differentially expressed genes from RNA-seq of cells
  nucleofected with either FD86 or FDScram (biological duplicates shown for each condition).
  The clusters are numbered on the left side of the plot, and the sample IDs are indicated
  at the bottom.(B) Differentially expressed genes clustered by the logCPM values
  of FD and FDScram samples. Cluster 4 is a set of upregulated genes with enrichment
  of GO terms related to cell migration, endocytosis, and apoptosis. Analysis for
  other clusters not presented due to <100 genes. The y axis shows the enriched terms,
  and the x axis shows GeneRatio (the fraction of genes associated with a term that
  were among the genes in this cluster). The sizes of the data point represent the
  number of genes in the cluster associated with the respective term and the colors
  represent the FDR-adjusted p values. The apoptotic signaling pathway term is high
  in GeneRatio and Gene Count with an adjusted p value < 0.05.(C) 25 genes enriched
  by FDScram treatment. The four genes that are also enriched in FD86-treated cells
  are marked with an asterisk.(D) Specific genes with GO terms associated with inflammation
  that are enriched in cells overexpressing IE86 (FD86 treated).
