caption: 'Effect of CTRP9 on the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Comparison of the
  relative expression of PI3K, Akt, and mTOR proteins between the two groups. Note:
  Relative protein expression levels of PI3K, AkT, and mTOR in the study group were
  1.53±0.06, 1.50±0.04, and 2.06±0.54, respectively; while those in the reference
  group were 0.64±0.28, 0.46±0.24, and 1.07±0.44, respectively.'
