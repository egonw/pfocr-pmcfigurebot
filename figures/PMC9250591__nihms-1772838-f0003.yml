figure_title: Absence of Hhip gene and protein expression in soft palate
caption: (A) H&E staining of soft palate (coronal section) in Control tissue to illustrate
  morphology. (B) X-Gal staining from HhiplacZ/+ reporter mouse indicates no expression
  in soft palate. Taste buds are labeled by K8 (red). Inset indicates positive lacZ
  expression in soft palate from Gli1lacZ reporter mouse. (C) Antibody detection of
  endogenous HHIP (red) and taste bud cells (K8, green) in Control tongue. There is
  no HHIP expression in soft palate, similar to absence of Hhip gene expression. Taste
  buds are outlined with oval lines in A-C. Dotted lines in B and C outline the base
  of the epithelium. Scale bar in A applies to B and C.
