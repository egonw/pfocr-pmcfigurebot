caption: 'Hypothesis: Natural products modulating oxidative stress and the AKT pathway
  (AKT and AKT effectors) regulate several cell functions. The oxidative stress-AKT
  effector signaling is shown in . Detailed future works are warranted to assess additional
  cell functions that are affected by natural products for anticancer treatment.'
