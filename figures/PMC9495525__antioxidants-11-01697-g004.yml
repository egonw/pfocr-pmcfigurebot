caption: Role of OLNZ in Iba-1-immunoreactive microglia and GFAP-immunoreactive astrocyte
  cells in the CA1 area of the hippocampus. Identification of Iba-1+ neuronal cells
  in the sham (A) 10× and (a) 200×, TI-mediated ischemic stroke (B) 10× and (b) 200×,
  and TI- mediated ischemic stroke +OLNZ (10 mg/kg) (C) 10× and (c) 200× groups and
  of GFAP immunoreactive astrocytes in the CA1 region in the sham (D) 10× and (d)
  200×, TI- mediated ischemic stroke (E) 10× and (e) 200×, and TI- mediated ischemic
  stroke +OLNZ (10 mg/kg) (F) 10× and (f) 200× groups. In the TI- mediated stroke
  group, Iba-1+ cells were notably augmented and GFAP+ cells exhibited bigger and
  denser processes in the CA1 area compared with OLNZ treatment groups. (G) Graphs
  signify the relative numbers of Iba1+ and (H) GFAP immunoreactive cells. Data were
  expressed as the mean ± SEM, n = 5 in each group. After performing a one-way ANOVA
  with Tukey’s post hoc test, p < 0.05 for comparisons of treatment groups with the
  sham group (#) and p < 0.05 for comparisons with the TI-induced stroke group (*)
  were considered significant.
