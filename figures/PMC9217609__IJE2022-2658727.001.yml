caption: '(a) The results of hydroxymethylation 5hmC staining in clinical specimens
  of papillary thyroid carcinoma showed that 5hmC was expressed in papillary thyroid
  carcinoma and normal thyroid tissues adjacent to the cancer, and the positive expression
  was brown (scale bar = 200 μm); (b) the results of genomic DNA 5hmC dot blot hybridization
  (dot blot) of papillary thyroid carcinoma;. (c) statistical analysis of genomic
  DNA 5hmC dot blot hybridization (dot blot) in papillary thyroid carcinoma; (d) real-time
  PCR was used to detect the expression of TET3 mRNA in papillary thyroid carcinoma
  and normal thyroid tissues; (e) western blot was used to detect the expression of
  TET3 in papillary thyroid carcinoma and adjacent normal thyroid samples. Sample
  size = 50 μg, internal reference: β-actin.'

  Pathway in Papillary Thyroid Cancer.
