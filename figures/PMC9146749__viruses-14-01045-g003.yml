caption: IBV Nsp14 inhibited chIFN-γ-mediated chSTAT1 nuclear translocation. (A–C)
  HD11 cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3.1-Flag-Nsp14 (1 μg) or pCMV-Myc-chJAK1
  (500 ng), pCMV-Myc-chJAK2 (500 ng), and pCMV-Myc-chSTAT1 (500 ng). After 24 h, luminescence
  was detected using dual-luciferase reporter assays. (D) Western blotting was used
  to detect the IBV Nsp14 protein level. (E) HD11 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-Flag-Nsp14
  (1 μg) for 24 h. The cells were stimulated with chIFN-γ (100 ng/mL) for 30 min.
  chSTAT1 protein was detected using an indirect immunofluorescence assay. chSTAT1
  nuclear accumulation was determined using confocal fluorescence microscopy. Data
  were presented as means ± SD. * = p < 0.05, ** = p < 0.01.
