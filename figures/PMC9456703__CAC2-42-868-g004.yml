caption: 'N‐Myc binds to DLL1 promoter to activate NOTCH1 signaling pathway in GBM
  cells. (A) Left schematic diagram shows the top 20 genes positively correlated with
  MYCN in the TCGA GBM RNA‐seq database. The right schematic diagram shows positively
  correlated genes (adjusted P < 0.05 and r > 0) of MYCN that were enriched in KEGG
  pathway analysis using DAVID software. (B) Schematic diagram shows the promoter
  regions of DLL1 and DLL3 are divided into 9 parts for ChIP assays. (C) ChIP analyses
  of the N‐Myc‐bound promoter regions of DLL1 and DLL3. The corresponding isotype
  IgG was used as a negative control. (D) Dual‐luciferase reporter system analyses
  of luciferase activity in GBM cells co‐transfected with reporter plasmids containing
  the DLL1/DLL3 promoter sequences and MYCN expression plasmids and qRT‐PCR analyses
  of the expression of DLL1/DLL3 in GBM cells transfected with MYCN expression plasmids.
  (E, F) qRT‐PCR and Western blotting analyses of the expression of indicated proteins
  in HUWE1‐KD cells compared with NC cells. (G) Western blotting analyses of nuclear
  and cytoplasmic N1ICD in HUWE1‐KD cells. (H) Western blotting analyses of the expression
  of Hes family BHLH transcription factor 1 (HES1) and HEY1 in HUWE1‐KD cells. (I)
  Growth curves of HUWE1‐KD cells treated with DAPT (25 μmol/L) tested by CCK‐8 assays.
  (J, K) Representative images of Transwell migration and invasion assays of HUWE1‐KD
  cells treated with DAPT (25 μmol/L). Data are presented as mean ± SD. *, P < 0.05;
  **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001. Abbreviations: KD, knockdown; NC, negative control;
