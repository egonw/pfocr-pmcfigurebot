figure_title: The CHI3L1 receptor and downstream pathway in NSCs to regulate neurogenesis
  in neuroinflammation
caption: '(A) Summary of CHI3L1 receptors and downstream signaling pathways. (B) Expression
  of CRTH2 receptor in NSCs (GFAP+Sox2+) but not immature (DCX+) or mature (NeuN+)
  neurons in adult hippocampus. Scale bars, 20 μm. (C) CRTH2 expression in cultured
  NSCs (Sox2+Nestin+). (D) Activation of GSK-3β (reduced inhibitory serine-9 phosphorylation)
  and inhibition of β-catenin (increased degradation) in NSC cultures treated with
  CHI3L1 (100 ng/ml). n = 3. (E) Lentiviral vectors to express two shRNAs for CRTH2
  knockdown (Lenti-shCRTH2, shCRTH2_1, and shCRTH2_2) and a control shRNA (Lenti-shNC).
  (F) shRNA-mediated CRTH2 knockdown efficiency. n = 3. (G) CRTH2 knockdown effect
  on GSK-3β/β-catenin pathway activation by CHI3L1 (2-hour treatment). n = 3. (H)
  CRTH2 knockdown effect on NSC proliferation in shRNA-expressing cultures, with or
  without CHI3L1 for 3 days. n = 4. Scale bars, 100 μm. (I) CRTH2 knockdown effect
  on NSC differentiation into neurons (Tuj1+) and glia (GFAP+) in shRNA-expressing
  cultures, with or without CHI3L1 for 3 days. n = 4. Scale bars, 100 μm. (J) Identified
  CHI3L1 signaling pathway inhibitory to neurogenesis: CHI3L1 binds to CRTH2 receptor
  and activates GSK-3β that in turn phosphorylates and destabilizes β-catenin and
  leads to reduced transcriptional activities for neurogenesis. (K) Timeline for assays
  of NSC proliferation and neuronal differentiation in msCtrl-IgG– or msAQP4-IgG–injected
  mice, receiving a potent GSK-3β inhibitor, TWS119 (30 mg/kg), intraperitoneally
  daily for 3 weeks. (L to N) Quantification of total proliferating cells (EdU+),
  radial glia–like NSCs (EdU+GFAP+), and transiently amplifying progenitor-like (EdU+GFAP−)
  cells. n = 4. (O to Q) Quantification of proliferating cells (BrdU+) at the time
  of hsAQP4-IgG injection, newborn immature neurons (BrdU+DCX+), and mature neurons
  (BrdU+NeuN+). n = 4. All bar graphs presented in means ± SEM and analyzed by one-way
  ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc analyses. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P
  < 0.0001.'
