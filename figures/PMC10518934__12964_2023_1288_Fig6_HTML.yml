caption: Hyperhomocysteinemic Drosophila melanogaster shows downregulation of the
  autophagy genes and upregulation of the stress response genes at systemic level.
  A Heat map illustrating RNA-Seq differential expression data for autophagy and stress
  response pathway genes in control versus CBS knockout (whole body) flies. Pairwise
  comparisons with wild type are shown. Red positive log fold change (log2FC). Blue
  negative log2FC. Heat map showing pathway specific expression of autophagy (B) and
  stress response (C) genes in the same knockout flies. Pairwise comparisons with
  wild type control strains are shown. Respective color legends representing log fold
  changes (log2FC). Three sets of data from 3 different wild type control and knockout
  flies (CBS-/-) were used for analysis.
