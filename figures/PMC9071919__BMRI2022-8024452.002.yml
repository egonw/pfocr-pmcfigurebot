caption: Hydrogen acts as a tumor suppressor of CRC in vivo. As shown in (a–c), tumor
  growth was significantly suppressed in nude mice administered inhalational H2. Hydrogen
  inhalation significantly reduced the tumor weight (1.11 ± 0.06 g vs. 1.56 ± 0.15 g,
  p = 0.021) and volume (898 ± 154 mm3 vs. 1413 ± 138 mm3, p = 0.032) compared to
  those in control mice.
