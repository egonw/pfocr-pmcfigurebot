caption: 'Effect of RR-AuNPs on the production of inflammatory cytokines and ROS in
  TNF-α/IFN-γ (T + I)-stimulated HaCaT cells. The production of (A) IL-6, (B) IL-8,
  and (C) TARC was measured using ELISA of the culture supernatant of T + I-stimulated
  HaCaT cells. (D) Fluorescence images and quantification of the results from HaCaT
  cells treated with RR-AuNPs, following staining with ROS staining dye. NC treated
  with medium alone; T + I, inflammation-induced control treated with T + I alone;
  PC treated with dexamethasone followed by T + I stimulation. The crosshatch marks
  indicate significant differences between NC and T + I, and asterisks indicate significant
  differences between T + I and each group. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ### and ***p <
  0.001.'
