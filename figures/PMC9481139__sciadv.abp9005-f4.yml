figure_title: Genetic inhibition of CDK9 or DHODH in combination with gilteritinib
  alters multiple signature pathways
caption: (A) GSEA plots of representative significantly down-regulated and up-regulated
  pathways in hallmark gene sets for shCDK9/gilteritinib versus scrambled/gilteritinib
  and scrambled/gilteritinib versus scrambled/vehicle comparisons. Combination treatment
  suppresses these pathways that are activated by gilteritinib treatment alone. (B)
  Cytoscape enrichment map of the top gene programs in shCDK9/gilteritinib combination.
  Enriched GSEA gene sets are predicted with Enrichment Map in Cytoscape and depicted
  by orange and purple nodes, where purple nodes represent significantly up-regulated
  pathways in combination treatment and orange nodes represent significantly down-regulated
  pathways in combination treatment. Node size is proportional to the number of genes
  in each node, line thickness indicates the overlap of genes between nodes, and the
  theme of genes in each cluster is specified. Clustered gene programs are labeled.
  (C) Heatmap showing normalized read counts of genes in selected top enriched pathways
  predicted by GSEA across different treatment groups of shCDK9-mediated synergy.
  Selected genes are labeled. The hierarchical clustering of genes and samples was
  performed with Euclidean distance matrix and Ward’s clustering method. (D) GSEA
  plots of representative significantly down-regulated and up-regulated pathways in
  hallmark gene sets for shDHODH/gilteritinib versus scrambled/vehicle and scrambled/gilteritinib
  versus scrambled/vehicle comparisons. Combination treatment suppresses these pathways
  that are activated by gilteritinib alone. (E) Heatmap showing normalized read counts
  of genes in selected top enriched pathways predicted by GSEA across different treatment
  groups of shDHODH-mediated synergy. Selected genes are labeled. The hierarchical
  clustering of genes and samples was performed with Euclidean distance matrix and
  Ward’s clustering method. (F) Cytoscape enrichment map of the top gene programs
  in shDHODH/gilteritinib combination. (G) Top glycolysis-related hits in positive
  selection of CRISPR screen upon gilteritinib treatment are highlighted in glycolysis
  pathway. Log(fold change) values of the top five hits are listed.
