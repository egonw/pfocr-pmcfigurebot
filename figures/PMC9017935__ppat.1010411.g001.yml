figure_title: DMAQ-B1 and AKT inhibitor VIII activated RNAi and JAK/STAT in vitro
caption: (A) Insulin/insulin-like growth factor I signaling (IIS) pathway schematic
  and proposed effect of DMAQ-B1 and AKT inhibitor VIII on downstream transcription
  factor activity. (B-E) Aag2 cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO), 1 μM DMAQ-B1,
  10 μM AKT inhibitor VIII, or combined drugs for 24 h. Phosphorylation of AKT, FOXO,
  and ERK were measured by western blot and phosphorylation was quantified for (B)
  P-AKT, (C) P-FOXO, and (D) P-ERK by densitometry and normalized to actin (*p < 0.05,
  One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s test correction for multiple comparisons). (F) P-FOXO
  and P-ERK abundance and localization were visualized in DAPI-stained Aag2 cells
  by immunofluorescence microscopy. (G-H) Protein localization of (F) P-FOXO and (G)
  P-ERK was quantified in microscopy images to evaluate whether fluorescent-tagged
  proteins was cytosolic or nuclear within individual cells by manually counting cells
  in images (***p<0.001, Two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s correction). (I-J) Induction of
  RNAi and JAK/STAT signaling was evaluated as transcript levels of (I) AGO2 and (J)
  vir-1 by qRT-PCR (*p < 0.05; **p<0.01, Unpaired t test with Welch’s correction for
  multiple comparisons). (K) Aag2 cells that received vehicle, individual, or combined
  drug treatment for 24 h were infected with ZIKV (MOI 0.01) and supernatant was collected
  at 1 and 3 d p.i. Supernatant virus was titered by standard plaque assay (****p<0.0001,
  Two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s correction). Closed circles represent individual replicates.
  Horizontal bars represent mean and error bars represent SD. Results are representative
  of triplicate independent experiments.
