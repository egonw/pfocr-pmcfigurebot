caption: 'Correlative image analysis and the mining of KEGG database identified the
  biology signaling pathways in the morphogenetic domains (central body position).
  (A) We identified 20 distinct gene expression patterns by computer image clustering
  analysis in the projected feature space of Principal Component Analysis. (B) We
  performed GO term analysis and identified 14 highly expressed biology signaling
  pathways from the gene expression image clusters. We generated 14-bit binary barcode
  that indicates the “presence” – “absence” state of the pathways in detection (white
  color: “presence;” black color: “absence”). We then performed hierarchical clustering
  and grouped the gene expression patterns according to pathway barcode similarity.
  By correlative analysis of the gene expression and the anatomy patterns, we identified
  the cell populations that highly express the biology signaling pathways. We performed
  pairwise comparison with the barcodes and constructed the map of the morphogenetic
  domain signaling network. For instance, along the A-P axis, we detected the mTOR
  signaling pathway in cluster 12 (neuron) but not cluster 17 (muscle). The mTOR signaling
  pathway regulates a wide variety of cell Biology Processes, such as lipid metabolism,
  autophagy, protein synthesis, ribosome biogenesis, cytoskeletal organization and
  cell survival . The results of analysis along the other 2 body axes of V-D and L-R
  were presented in the Supplementary Fig. 7.'
