caption: effects of baicalein on cell viability and intracellular lipid accumulation.
  (A) Chemical structure of baicalein. (B) THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells were
  treated with the indicated concentrations of baicalein for 24 h or with 100 μM baicalein
  for various times. MTT assay was employed to evaluate cell viability. (C–D) THP-1
  macrophage-derived foam cells were incubated with PBS or 100 μM baicalein for 24
  h. (C) The cells were fixed and then stained with Oil Red O to assay intracellular
  lipid deposition. The magnification of each panel is 200×. (D) Intracellular TC,
  FC, and CE amounts were detected by HPLC. Data are expressed as mean ± SD from three
  independent experiments. *P < 0.05 vs 0 μM or 0 h groups.

  by activating the PPARγ/LXRα pathway.
