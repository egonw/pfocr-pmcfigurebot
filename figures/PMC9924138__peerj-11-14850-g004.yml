figure_title: Overlapping genes between DE-mRNAs and target genes predicted by DE-miRNAs
  and miRNA-mRNA regulatory network
caption: (A) Venn diagram of overlapping genes between up-regulated DE-mRNAs and predicted
  target genes of down-regulated DE-miRNAs. (B) Venn diagram of overlapping genes
  between down-regulated mRNAs and down-regulated mRNAs and predicted target genes
  of up-regulated DE-miRNAs. (C) miRNA-mRNA regulatory network. Red triangles represent
  upregulated miRNAs, purple triangles represent downregulated miRNAs, red ovals represent
  upregulated mRNAs, purple ovals represent downregulated mRNAs and lines represent
  interactions between DE-miRNAs and DE-mRNAs. The yellow rectangles indicate SLIT3
  and miRNAs that may target SLIT3. (D) Enriched GO terms. Purple and orange represent
  downregulated and upregulated expression, respectively. Among them, SLIT3 was enriched
  in Roundabout signal pathway. TAL1 was also enriched in term of angiogenesis.

  in ectopic pregnancy.
