caption: (a) A general concept of the reaction sequence leading to stress tolerance
  When analyzing plant responses to moderate drought and salt tolerance, a general
  scheme of responses was found. For successful adaptation to a stress event, it is
  important for a plant to find access to nutrients during the adaptation phase. Moreover,
  it is essential to control stress-induced ROS production, prevent an overshoot,
  and down-regulate ROS production at the end of the adaptation phase; (b) Example
  of stress signaling. Signaling intensity can be reduced (i) by ameliorating effects
  of compatible solutes (=reduction in the stress level), and (ii) by direct interaction
  of plant metabolites with the signaling molecule species or by inhibition of the
  synthesis of the signaling molecule (=reducing the amount of free signaling molecules).
