caption: 'Phosphorylated AMPK (pAMPK) expression in phrenic motoneurons following
  C2 hemi-section. (A) Representative images showing the expression of pAMPK in phrenic
  motoneurons labeled with CTB in uninjured animals and in denervated phrenic motoneurons
  in C2 hemisected rats, 1 h, 1 d, and 7 d post-injury (P.I.). (B) Quantification
  of pAMPK in phrenic motoneurons for uninjured animals, and intact and injured sides
  of C2 hemisected animals 1 h, 1 d, 3 d, and 7 d following injury. # 1 d P.I. compared
  to 1 h P.I. for the injured side, p < 0.001. * Compared to the uninjured group,
  p < 0.001.'
