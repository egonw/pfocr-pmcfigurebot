caption: 'Circle plot of signaling pathway networks inferred by CellChat. A: Visualization
  of the inferred integrin beta2 signaling pathway network details; B: Visualization
  of the inferred major histocompatibility class I signaling pathway network details.
  The different colors of the circles represent different cell groups. The size of
  the circle is proportional to the number of cells in the cell group. The arrows
  point from the source to the target, and the colors of the edges are consistent
  with those of the signal source. The width of the edges represents the communication
  probability. ITGB2: Integrin beta2; MHC-I: Major histocompatibility class I.'
