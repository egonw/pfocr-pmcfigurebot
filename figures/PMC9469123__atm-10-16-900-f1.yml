caption: Effect of ZGZT Capsule on mechanical pain threshold in PMOP rats. There was
  no significant change in the mechanical pain threshold in the control group, but
  the mechanical pain threshold in the PMOP group, the PMOP + ZGZT group and the PMOP
  + E2 group decreased significantly at 1 and 3 months after operation. Compared with
  PMOP group, PMOP + ZGZT group and PMOP + E2 group could partially alleviate the
  reduction of pain threshold after 1 and 3 months of treatment, and PMOP + ZGZT group
  had the most significant in alleviate the reduction of pain threshold after 3 months
  of treatment. PMOP, Postmenopausal osteoporosis; ZGZT, Zhuanggu Zhitong; E2, estrogen.
