figure_title: HDAC7 expression is significantly upregulated by WNT5A overexpression
  and HDAC7 overexpression facilitates ESCC metastasis in vitro and in vivo
caption: A Representative western blots showing the levels of HDAC7, HDAC4, HDAC5,
  and HDAC9 in WNT5A-overexpressing cells. B Western blots showing HDAC7 levels in
  various ESCC cells. C Representative western blots showing FLAG-HDAC7, HDAC7, SNAIL,
  E-cadherin, SLUG, TWIST1, and vimentin levels in HDAC7-overexpressing or HDAC7 knockdown
  ESCC cells. D, E Representative images and statistical analysis of wound healing
  assays and Transwell migration/invasion assays using HDAC7 OE and shHDAC7 ESCC cells.
  The migratory ability in wound healing assays was expressed as the mean scratch
  area. The initial scratch area (0 h) was set to 100%. F Representative fluorescence
  images of nude mice 7 weeks after the tail vein injection. G Representative images
  of HE staining of lung samples and statistical analysis of the metastatic nodules
  per lung (n = 5 per group). Scale bars, 1 mm and 100 μm (inset). β-actin was used
  as an internal control. *P < 0.05 compared with the NC group. LV lentivirus, L left,
  R right.

  by activating the HDAC7/SNAIL signaling pathway.
