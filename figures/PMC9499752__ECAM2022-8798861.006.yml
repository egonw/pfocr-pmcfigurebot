caption: 'Arbutin inhibited heat stress-induced apoptosis of HaCAT and DFL cells by
  activating the PI3K/AKT pathway. (a) Representative scatter plots of apoptosis in
  HaCAT and DFL cells detected by flow cytometry with solvent, 100 μmol/L arbutin,
  and arbutin (100 μmol/L) + LY294002 (50 μmol/L). (b) Statistically compared proportion
  of apoptotic cells in (a) (n = 3). (c) Bax and Bcl2 protein expressions in HaCAT
  and DFL cells of different groups detected using Western blotting. (d) Statistically
  compared the expression of Bax and Bcl2 protein in (c) (n = 3). P value was calculated
  by one-way ANOVA. ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. the control group; ###P < 0.001 vs. the solvent
  group; &&&P < 0.001 vs. the Ar group.'
