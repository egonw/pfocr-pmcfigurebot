figure_title: DTL promotes the binding of RUVBL1 to transcription cofactor β-catenin
caption: A Volcano plot comparing control and cells high expression of RUVBL1 after
  IR 4 h. B Heat map from RNA-sequencing analysis. C Enrichment of differentially
  expressed genes in GO signaling pathways is illustrated in a bar graph. Y-axis represents
  pathways, and the X-axis represents rich factor. D Enrichment of differentially
  expressed genes in signaling pathways is illustrated in an advanced bubble chart.
  Size and color of the bubble are representation of the amount of differentially
  expressed genes enriched in pathways and their enrichment significance, respectively.
  E Immunoprecipitation (IP) analysis of the interaction between RUVBL1 and β-catenin,
  c-Myc, STAT3 in HEK293T cells after IR 4 h. F HEK293T cells transfected with Myc-RUVBL1,
  DTL, HA-Ub, HA-Ub K63 or HA-Ub K63R were immunoprecipitated with Myc antibody and
  western blot analysis. G MDA-MB-231-RR cells transfected with Flag-DTL, HA-Ub, HA-Ub
  K63 or HA-Ub K63R were immunoprecipitated with RUVBL1 antibody and western blot
  analysis.

  regulation of NHEJ pathway and enhances radiation resistance in breast cancer.
