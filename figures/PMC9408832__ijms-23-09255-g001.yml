caption: The interplay between ceramide and S1P forms the basis of the sphingolipid
  rheostat and is the focus of great interest because of its implications for the
  hallmarks of cancer. (A) Sphingolipid rheostat and how this balance can affect cell
  growth. (B) Key effects of significant sphingolipids on the hallmarks of cancer.
  (C) Vulnerabilities of the rheostat of IDHmut tumors make them susceptible to drugs
  that induce ceramide accumulation or S1P depletion. Therefore, sphingolipid pathway
  modulators may play a key role in altering the rheostat and diminishing the hallmarks
  of cancer.
