figure_title: Gene expression of p53 interactors in the MCF-7 sublines
caption: 'A–D RNA-seq validation. Gene expression after DOX treatment (24 h) in the
  MCF-7 (-shNT, -shΔ40p53, -shp53α, LeGO and Δ40p53) sublines. A MELK, B NDC80, C
  UHRF1 and D TRIP13. Data shown represent three independent experiments of three
  technical replicates. Results are shown as the mean ± SD and were normalised by
  the relative expression of the vehicle-treated cells. Statistical analyses were
  carried out using two-way ANOVA followed by Sidak’s post-test. Results were considered
  significant at p < 0.05; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. E Interaction between differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) and p53 pathway proteins based on STRING data of high confidence
  (overall interaction score >0.9; see Supplementary Table  for breakdown of score).
  Orange – p53 pathway proteins; Blue: DEGs in DOX-treated MCF-7-shΔ40p53 vs MCF-7-shNT;
  Green – DEGs in DOX-treated MCF-7-Δ40p53 vs MCF-7-LeGO; Yellow – DEGs in DOX-treated
  MCF-7-shΔ40p53 vs MCF-7-shNT and MCF-7-Δ40p53 vs MCF-7-LeGO. F Heatmaps of mRNA
  levels of p53 interactors: ATM, ATR, CHECK2, HDM2, MAPK1, EP300, TOPOIIα, TOPOIIβ,
  BRCA1, RAD51, RAD52, LIG4, PARP1, APEX1 and OGG1 after 6 or 24 h of DOX treatment
  and normalised to vehicle-treated cells in the MCF-7 (-shNT, -shΔ40p53, -shp53α,
  LeGO and Δ40p53) sublines (see Supplementary Fig. ,  for comparison between sublines
  and statistical analyses). Data shown represent three independent experiments of
  three technical replicates.'
