caption: 'Ischemia reduces the conductance of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway.
  Force:flow relationships are plotted for control (closed symbols) and ischemia (open
  symbols) mitochondria when provided with glutamate + malate (G + M, triangles, left)
  or pyruvate + malate (P + M, squares, right). The slope of the force:flow relationship
  represents the conductance of that component of oxidative phosphorylation. A and
  B: force:flow relationship of JO and the difference in free energy between redox
  potential (Eh NAD/NADH) and ΔGATP, representing the conductance of the entire oxidative
  phosphorylation pathway (LOxPhos), which is reduced in ischemia mitochondria. C
  and D: force:flow relationship between JO and the difference in free energy between
  redox potential and ΔΨ represents the conductance of the electron transport chain
  (LETC). The lower slope in ischemia mitochondria indicates a decreased conductance,
  or effective activity of the ETC, following ischemia. E and F: force:flow relationship
  between JO and the difference in free energy between ΔΨ and ΔGATP represents the
  conductance of the combined activity of the ATP synthase and the adenine nucleotide
  translocase (ANT) (LATP synth +ANT). Ischemia decreases the activity of this component,
  which is responsible for ATP synthesis and transport from the mitochondrial matrix
  to the intermembrane space. Data are means ± SE; n = 4–6 rats per condition. Slopes
  (LOxPhos, LATP synth +ANT, LETC) and r2 values are listed in .'
