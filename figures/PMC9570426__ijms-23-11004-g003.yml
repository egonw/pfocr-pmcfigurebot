caption: Western blot analysis of total protein samples for c-Jun phosphorylation
  in HT-1080 cells in response to RSL-3 treatment. (a) Western blot analysis was performed
  as described below. Phosphorylated c-Jun protein levels were determined after 24
  h treatment with RSL-3 (0.2 µg/mL or 0.5 µg/mL) in the presence or absence of the
  JNK inhibitor, JNK-IN-8 (10 µM). GAPDH were labeled for loading the control. (b)
  Densitometry data represent the intensity of phosphorylated c-Jun normalized to
  GAPDH; each data point represents the average ± SD from at least three independent
  experiments. * Significantly different (p < 0.05) from control.
