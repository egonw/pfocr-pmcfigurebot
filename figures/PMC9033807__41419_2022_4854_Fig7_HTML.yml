figure_title: miR-144 acts as a key regulator of the Itch-p63-Ago2 pathway
caption: A H1299, SCC9, and Saos2 cells were transfected with the indicated miRNA
  expression plasmids. A colony formation assay was performed. n = 3. B The numbers
  of colonies were counted and plotted in H1299, SCC9, and Saos2 cells, as indicated.
  C Ago2 RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) was performed, followed by qRT–PCR. A RIP assay
  with an Ago2 antibody was used to assess the binding ability between miR-144/451
  and Ago2 mRNA in wt MEFs, TAp63−/− MEFs, or TAp63−/− MEFs transfected with a TAp63
  expression construct. Error bars represent the mean ± SD. All experiments were performed
  in triplicate. D The levels of miR-451 and miR-144 expression were detected by qRT–PCR.
  E H1299 and Saos2 cells were transfected with the indicated expression plasmids.
  The effect of miR-144 on TAp63-dependent apoptosis was determined by annexin V staining
  and flow cytometry. Error bars indicate the SEM. (n = 3). F Western blots were used
  to visualize the protein expression of TAp63 and Itch in H1299 cells. Actin was
  used as a loading control. G Similar to (F), except that Saos2 cells were used.
  H The effect of miR-144 depletion using miR-144 decoy on cell cycle arrest. H1299
  cells were transfected with control-miRNA or miR-144, in combination with control
  miRNA decoy, or with miR-144 as indicated. Cell cycle analysis was determined by
  PI staining and flow cytometry. The results represent the average of triplicate
  experiments. The G1/S ratio is provided. n = 3. I H1299 and Saos2 cells were transfected
  with the indicated miRNA expression constructs. Transwell invasion (Matrigel matrix-coated)
  assays were performed. The numbers of invading cells were quantified using ImageJ
  software. J Wild-type MEFs or TAp63−/− MEFs were transfected with the indicated
  miRNA expression constructs and subjected to Transwell invasion assays. All experiments
  were performed in triplicate. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.
