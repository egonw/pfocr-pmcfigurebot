caption: Knockdown of VGLL4 impeded multiplication, migration, invasion and EMT of
  NSCLC cells. A, B. IHC and qRT-PCR methods were employed to detect VGLL4 protein
  and mRNA expressions in NSCLC tissues and paracancerous tissues. C, D. Western blot
  and qRT-PCR were implemented to detect VGLL4 protein and mRNA expressions in NSCLC
  cells and BEAS2B cells. Original blots are shown in  (See Supplementary Online Information
  at www.celljournal.org), Figure 5C. E. VGLL4 expression in NSCLC cells transfected
  with sh-VGLL4 was detected by qRT-PCR. F, G. CCK-8 assay was employed to monitor
  NSCLC cell multiplication. H, I. Transwell experiments were executed to detect NSCLC
  cell migration and invasion. J, K. Western blot was used to determine E-cadherin
  and Vimentin protein expressions in NSCLC cells transfected with sh-VGLL4. Original
  blots are shown in  (See Supplementary Online Information at www.celljournal.org),
  Figure 5J. All experiments were repeated thrice with triplicate samples in each
  experiment. *; P<0.05, EMT; Epithelial-mesenchymal transition, NSCLC; Non-small
