caption: 'Treatment with the LPAR1/3 antagonist, ki16425, inhibits the change in the
  expression levels of EMT markers and fibrotic factors in renal tubular epithelial
  cells of db/db mice. The animal experiments are described in the Materials and Methods
  section. Immunohistochemical detection of (A) the EMT markers E-cadherin and vimentin,
  and (B) the fibrotic factors fibronectin (FN) and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA),
  in the kidney tissues was performed using specific antibodies and diaminobenzidine
  (DAB). Nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin. The positive expression area
  of each target gene was quantified using ImageJ software. Representative images
  (left) and quantitative analysis bar graphs (right) are shown. Original magnification,
  200×; scale bars, 20 μm; n = 3 mice per group. Data are presented as the mean ±
  standard error of the mean (SEM). *** p < 0.005 vs. wild-type (WT); ## p < 0.01,
  ### p < 0.005 vs. db/db.'
