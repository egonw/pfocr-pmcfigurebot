caption: Chemical structures of Ursolic Acid (A) and Epirubicin (B). The effects of
  UA or EPI on cell viability were determined by CCK-8 assay. (C) MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
  cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of UA for 24 h. (D) MCF-7 and
  MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of EPI for 24 h.
  The means and SEM were shown. n = 3. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001 versus
  cells without drug treatment.
