caption: Investigation of the underlying mechanisms related to PER. (A) The heat map
  of DEGs between the groups with and without PER of AJCC stage T1 HCC after hepatectomy.
  (B) Signaling pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs associated with PER. (C) Volcano
  plot of DEGs associated with PER; ATP1A2 and SLC5A1 were found to be involved in
  the bile secretion item. PER, postoperative early recurrence; non-PER, none postoperative
  early recurrence; IL-17, interleukin-17; DEGs, differentially-expressed genes; AJCC,
  American Joint Committee on Cancer; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma.
article_title: Construction of a predictive nomogram and bioinformatic investigation
  of the potential mechanism of postoperative early recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma
  meeting the Milan criteria.
