caption: 'Latency analysis and RF structure dependence of bidirectional-plasticity
  in Area 17. A, Population peak response change ratios of tested Area 17 neurons
  during the early epoch of biased-adaptation stimulation. B, Population peak response
  change ratios of tested Area 17 neurons during the middle epoch of biased-adaptation
  stimulation. C, Population peak response change ratios of tested Area 17 neurons
  during the late epoch of biased-adaptation stimulation. D, Peak response (change)
  ratios of Area 17 neurons exposed to RF-center-only (1.5–2.5° in diameter) stimulation.
  Top left, Schematic diagram of stimulation field. Bottom left, Peak response curves
  of two typical neurons. Right, Population peak response change ratios of Area 17
  neurons. Blue bars indicate RF-center-only condition, whereas the gray bars are
  from both RF center and surround (adopted from H). E, same with D, under RF-surround-only
  condition (annular, 4° internal and 10° external in diameter). Blue bars in right
  figure indicate RF-surround-only condition. Error bars indicate SEM. F, RS/FS classification
  analysis. Left, Spike waveform examples of RS/FS neurons. Right, Proportions of
  potentiation-exhibiting or adaptation-only neurons among RS (n = 54)/FS (n = 51)
  neurons. G, Simple/Complex classification analysis. Left, PSTH examples of Simple/Complex
  cells. Right, Proportions of potentiation-exhibiting or adaptation-only neurons
  among Simple (n = 44)/Complex (n = 61) cells; ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05.
  n.s.: not significant (p ≥ 0.05).'
