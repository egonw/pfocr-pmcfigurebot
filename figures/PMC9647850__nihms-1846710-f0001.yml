caption: Overview of the pathway in oncolytic virotherapy. Inoculation introduces
  the oncolytic virus (OV) to the tumor. OVs bind to specific extracellular surface
  markers that are solely expressed on tumor cells, gaining entry into the cell. Hijacking
  the host machinery, the OVs rapidly replicate and induce oncolysis, releasing viral
  progeny, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), damage-associated molecular
  patterns (DAMPs), chemokines, and cytokines. Released viral progeny continue the
  oncolytic cycle by binding to neighboring tumor cells, while the other factors work
  to recruit various types of immune cells (e.g., CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and
  NK cells) to the tumor, allowing for tumor infiltration and enhanced eradication
  of malignant cells. Alternatively, some oncolytic viruses do not induce oncolysis,
  rather these viruses induce secretion of DAMPS and pro-inflammatory cytokines to
  recruit immune cells to target the tumor cells. Created with BioRender.com.
