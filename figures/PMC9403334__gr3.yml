caption: TME factors interfering mitochondrial functions of TILs. Continuous hypoxia,
  metabolic stress and antigen stimulation impede the functional fitness of TIL mitochondria
  and mitochondrial biogenesis. In addition, they upregulate PD-1, Blimp-1 and PGC1-dependent
  metabolic reprogramming and depolarize mROS production, while reducing mitochondrial
  cristae remodelling and OXPHOS pathway. These changes skew bioenergetic signalling,
  metabolic reprogramming and ion-based pathways rendering TILs exhausted and non-functional.
