caption: Pathway enrichment analysis from absolutely identified metabolites in (A)
  KEGG and (B) SPMDB databases. Graph shows the impact the statistically significant
  identified metabolites have in the different pathways (x-axis) together with the
  statistical significance of those metabolites (y-axis). Highlighted pathways have
  several statistically significant metabolites that in turn produce a high impact
  in the pathway.
