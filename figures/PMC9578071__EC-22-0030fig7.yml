caption: The ceRNA network of hsa_circ_0090364 related to JAK-STAT pathway. (A, B,
  D and E) JAK1 mRNA and STAT3 mRNA expression are high in the GD group and are positively
  correlated with hsa_circ_0090364 expression in Graves’ disease patients’ PBMCs.
  (C and F) The relative expression levels of JAK1 mRNA and STAT3 mRNA after shRNA-hsa_circ_0090364
  or shRNA negative control (shN) transfection in Jurkat cells. The results are indicated
  as the mean ± s.d. of three independent experiments; horizontal lines show the mean
  (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001).
