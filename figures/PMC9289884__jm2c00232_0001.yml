caption: 'Overview of pterin activation in the trypanosomatidic folate pathway when
  DHFR is inhibited and PTR1 provides a metabolic bypass. Under normal conditions
  (indicated by dashed lines), the DHFR domain of the bifunctional DHFR-TS reduces
  biological folates to tetrahydrofolate (THF). Serine hydroxymethyl transferase (SHMT)
  converts THF to 5,10-methylene THF, which has a central role in amino acid synthesis,
  protein biosynthesis, and one-carbon transfer. It is also required by the TS domain
  of DHFR-TS to convert deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine monophosphate
  (dTMP), which is necessary for DNA synthesis. PTR1 catalyzes the reduction of unconjugated
  pterins, like biopterin, and takes over folate reduction when DHFR is inhibited
  (continuous lines), thus acting as a metabolic bypass and an important additional
  target for shutting down the trypanosomatidic folate pathway. Both proteins are
  shown in cartoon representation (DHFR domain of DHFR-TS: purple, PTR1 monomer of
  the functional tetramer: light pink) with the NADPH/NADP+ cofactor in a stick representation
  with black carbons and the folate substrate in yellow spheres. In PTR1, an arginine
  residue from a neighboring subunit that points into the active site is shown in
  a magenta stick representation.'
