caption: 'The gene expression in HepG2 cells exposed to human serum. (A,B) Overrepresentation
  analysis of upregulated or downregulated genes in cells incubated with serum from
  fasting participants, compared to cells in serum-free medium (>1.5-fold up- or downregulated,
  fdr < 0.05). (C) Upper panel: Selected genes in the PI3K-Akt and/or focal adhesion
  pathway that were upregulated in cells incubated with human serum. Lower panel:
  Selected genes in the PPAR signalling or insulin resistance pathways that were downregulated
  in cells incubated with human serum. Gene expression values are displayed as TPM
  (mean Â± SEM). SFM: serum-free medium.'
