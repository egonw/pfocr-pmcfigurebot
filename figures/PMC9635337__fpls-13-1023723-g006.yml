caption: Effect of Cd on IAA and tryptophan content in wild-type and osaux1-3 content.
  (A) Cadmium content was measured in root (B), indole 3-acetic acid (IAA) (C), and
  tryptophan content in WT and osaux1-3. Rice seedlings were inoculated with or without
  (B) cereus and 200 µM CdCl2 for 4 days in three biological repeats. (D, E) Relative
  mRNA levels of YUCCA and AUX1 in roots of wild-type and osaux1-3 after 3 days of
  treatment with 200 µM CdCl2 and (B) cereus. Three biological repeats were included
  for quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Lowercase letters indicate significant differences
  between means, determined using Duncan’s multiple range mean comparisons.
article_title: Indole pyruvate decarboxylase gene regulates the auxin synthesis pathway
  in rice by interacting with the indole-3-acetic acid–amido synthetase gene, promoting
  root hair development under cadmium stress.
