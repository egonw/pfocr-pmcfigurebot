caption: Xanthoxal features. (A) Scheme of the abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis pathway
  in plants. ABA synthesis proceeds from the carotenoid pathway, which starts from
  the precursor isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), a C5 (five carbon atoms molecule),
  and, through β-carotene, a C40, produces epoxydic xanthophylls, such as all-trans-violaxanthin,
  still a C40. By isomerization, 9′-cis-neoxanthin and 9-cis-violaxanthin are further
  obtained, which can be oxidatively cleaved by 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenases
  (NCEDs) in the first specifically committed step of ABA synthesis, resulting in
  the production of xanthoxal, a C15. Up to the C40 to C15 conversion, which is the
  rate-limiting step of ABA biosynthesis, the pathway takes place in the plastids
  (proplastids, in seeds). Thereafter, in the cytoplasm, ABA (still a C15) is synthesized
  from xanthoxal through ABA aldehyde. Double arrows indicate multiple biosynthetic
  steps. (B) Chemical structure of cis,trans-xanthoxal (oxygen residues are evidenced
  in red), the biologically active form of xanthoxal.
