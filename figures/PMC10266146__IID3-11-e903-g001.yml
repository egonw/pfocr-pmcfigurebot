caption: Tapinarof inhibits Tfh cell differentiation in patients with SLE. (A) PBMCs
  from patients with SLE were cultured in the different polarization conditions for
  3 days and percentages of Tfh cells were investigated (n = 5–6). (B) Schematic model
  of the therapeutic effect of tapinarof on the lupus syndrome in MRL/lpr mice. The
  data were obtained from two independent experiments. Error bars represent SD. Each
  symbol in the graphs represents one sample; **p < .01. SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus.

  Tfh cell differentiation via regulation of the JAK2‐STAT3 signaling pathway.
