caption: The biosynthetic pathway to aestuaramide A from Lyngbya sp. The precursor
  peptide contains multiple core sequences that are arranged as cassettes. Heterocyclization
  and macrocyclization of each core is carried out by the canonical biosynthetic enzymes.
  Incubation of purified aestuaramide A with recombinant LynF results in O-prenylation
  on Tyr, which subsequently undergoes a Claisen rearrangement to produce a Tyr forward
  C-prenylated product.
