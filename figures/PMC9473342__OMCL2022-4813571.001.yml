caption: 'DSC2 mRNA and DSC2 protein expressions are downregulated in human GC specimens
  and GC cells. (a and b) The relationship between the DSC2 mRNA expressions and the
  gastric carcinogenesis were analyzed using TCGA database. The expression of mRNA
  for DSC2 and the relevant clinical data of GC patients were analyzed by converting
  the expression levels into transcripts per million (TPM). (a) The degree of differentiation.
  (b) The pTNM stage. ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗∗p < 0.001. (c–e) The expressions of DSC2 mRNA,
  DSC2 protein in adjacent normal tissues (N), paracancerous tissues (P), and GC tissues
  (T) of clinical specimens were tested through qRT-PCR (c), IHC, blue is the nucleus,
  and brownish yellow is the DSC2 expression, the scale bar = 20 μm (d) and Western
  blot assay (e). n = 47, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01 vs. N, #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01 vs. P.
  DSC2 expressions of GC MGC-803, SGC-7901, BGC-823 cells, and normal gastric GES-1
  cells were detected by qRT-PCR (f) and Western blot assay (g). Data are presented
  as mean ± SD from three separate experiments. ∗∗∗p < 0.001 vs. GES-1 cells.'
