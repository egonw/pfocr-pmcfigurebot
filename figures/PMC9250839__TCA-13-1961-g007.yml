caption: Galectin‐3 activated Notch1 signaling pathway and promoted the cancer cell
  stemness of HER2‐positive breast cancer cells. (a) Immunofluorescence images of
  galectin‐3 (red) and DAPI (blue) in SKBR3‐CT cells, SKBR3‐OE cells, JIMT‐CT cells,
  and JIMT‐KO cells. (b) Western blot analysis of Notch1 pathway proteins (Notch1,
  NICD, HES1, and HEY1) and stemness biomarkers (CD24, CD44, CD133, Nanog, and E‐cadherin);
  β‐actin was used as a loading control. (c) Mammosphere formation in SKBR3‐OE, SKBR3‐CT,
  JIMT1‐KO, and JITM1‐CT cells. Representative images (top) and quantitative data
  (bottom) of mammosphere formation are shown. Scale bars, 100 μm. The significant
  differences are indicated by asterisk (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001)
