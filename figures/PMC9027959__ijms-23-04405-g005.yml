caption: 'AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor Compound C protects against
  tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP)-induced cytotoxicity in immortalized Fischer rat
  Schwann cells 1 (IFRS1). Treatment with tBHP for 3 h decreased survival rate in
  IFRS1 cells as measured by MTT assay whereas pretreatment with 5 μM Compound C or
  10 μM DHA for 12 h significantly protected against tBHP-induced cytotoxicity. Each
  value represents the mean ± S.E. of six experiments. **: p < 0.01 compared with
  tBHP(-); ##: p < 0.01 compared with tBHP(+).'
