caption: Capsicum and N. benthamiana WA vasiRNA targets are enriched in the ribosome
  and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) KEGG pathways. Log fold
  changes of significantly differentially regulated vasiRNAs (21 nt and 22 nt combined)
  are shown for one or both of capsicum and N. benthamiana WA (green shading indicates
  increased significantly abundance of vasiRNAs targeting associated host transcripts
  in response to TSWV infection, and blue shading indicates significantly decreased
  vasiRNA abundance). Enrichment for these pathways suggests that localisation of
  vasiRNA template to the ER may be the functional basis for vasiRNA target ‘selection’.
  KEGG pathway analysis and visualisation were carried out using Pathview, v1.36.0
  (Charlotte, NC, USA) [].
