figure_title: G6PD increases ROS promotion to regulate ROS-regulated cell death pathway
  to promote human mesothelioma cell death in vitro
caption: 'A. Tumor cells were cultured in the presence of the indicated concentrations
  of AG1 for 24h. Cells were stained with PI and analyzed by flow cytometry. % cell
  death is calculated as % PI+ cells and presented at the right panels. Shown are
  results of one of two experiments. Cycle: Mean, Bar: SD. B. NCI-H226 cells were
  treated with AG1 at 10 μM for 24h and analyzed by RNA-Seq. Differentially expressed
  genes induced by AG1 in the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis, mitochondria, and
  unfolded protein response pathways are shown. C. Tumor cells were labeled by ROS
  assay stain, treated with AG1 at 10μM for 24h, and analyzed by flow cytometry. The
  MFI of ROS were quantified and presented at the bottom panel. Column: Mean, Bar:
  SD.'
