caption: 'Multivariate statistical analysis of the distribution of serum metabolites
  and the identification of their metabolites. Note: control group (n = 5); model
  group (n = 5); PCP group (n = 5). (A,B) Orthogonal partial least-squares analysis
  (OPLS-DA) was used to distinguish overall differences in metabolic profiles between
  groups and to find different metabolites between groups. (C) Control vs. model:
  bubble chart for metabolic pathway enrichment (the ordinate is the name of the metabolic
  pathway; the abscissa is the enrichment factor (rich factor = number of significantly
  different metabolites/total number of metabolites in the metabolic pathway; the
  larger the rich factor, the greater the degree of enrichment; the color from green
  to red indicates that the p-value decreases again; the larger the dot, the greater
  the number of metabolites enriched in the metabolic pathway). (D) Americine. (E)
  PC(O-18:1(4Z)/0:0). (F) Correlation analysis of lung flora and metabolism. Significant
  differences are indicated by * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.'
