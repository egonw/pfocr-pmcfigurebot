caption: 'The disrupted expression of TLR4 and GABAARα1 in different brain sites.
  Protein extracts were immunoblotted with antibodies to TLR4, GABAARα1, and GAPDH.
  The blots were stripped between antibodies and results expressed as densitometric
  units ± SEM. Expression levels of TLR4 and GABAARα1 protein in the temporal cortex
  (A–C), hippocampus (D–F), medullary dorsal horn (G–I), and trigeminal ganglion (J–L)
  were determined using western blotting and quantitative assessment. Significant
  differences were observed between the epilepsy–migraine comorbidity group and the
  other three groups (n = 3, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01). There were no apparent differences
  between the migraine group and the epilepsy group. TC: temporal cortex, H: hippocampus,
  DH: medullary dorsal horn, TG: trigeminal ganglion.'
