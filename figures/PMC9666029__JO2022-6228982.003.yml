caption: Knockdown of LINC01279 induced the cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase in GC
  cells. (a) Flow cytometric analysis detected cell cycle distribution of LINC01279
  knockdown on gastric cancer SGC-7901 and MGC-803 cells; (b, c) fluorescence quantitative
  PCR was used to detect the expression of G0/G1 phase-related regulatory proteins,
  such as p21, cyclin D1, CDK4, and CDK6. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01.

  Migration by Inhibiting PI3K/Akt/mTOR Signaling Pathway.
