caption: Pre-treatment with citropten reduces NFκB and MAPK signaling pathway in activated
  Jurkat and HT-29. (A,B) Jurkat cells were pre-treated with 40 μM (A) or the indicated
  concentration (0 to 40 μM, (B)) of citropten and were stimulated with anti-CD3 antibodies
  (20 μg/mL) and anti-CD28 antibodies (7 μg/mL) for 1 h (A) or 30 min (B). For separation
  of nucleic extract (A), cells were lysed by using NE-PER kit. Nuclear transported
  p65 was detected in nuclear extract and cytosolic extract. Degraded and phosphorylated
  IκBα were detected in cytosolic extract. Detected proteins were normalized with
  the intensity of loading control proteins (LaminB for nuclear extract and β-actin
  for cytosolic extract). For the detection of phosphorylated level (B), harvested
  cells were lysed in RIPA buffer. Phosphorylated and total protein of ERK, p38 and
  JNK were determined via Western blot analysis. Phosphorylated levels were normalized
  with the intensity of total proteins and are presented in bar graphs. (C,D) HT-29
  cells were pre-treated with 40 μM (C) or the indicated concentration (0 to 40 μM,
  (D)) of citropten and were stimulated with recombinant TNFα (10 ng/mL) for 1 h (C)
  or 30 min (D). For separation of nucleic extract (C), cells were lysed by using
  NE-PER kit. Nuclear transported p65 was detected in nuclear extract and cytosolic
  extract, respectively. Degraded and phosphorylated IκBα were detected in cytosolic
  extract. Detected proteins were normalized with the intensity of loading control
  proteins (LaminB for nuclear extract and β-actin for cytosolic extract). For the
  detection of phosphorylated level (D), harvested cells were lysed in RIPA buffer.
  Phosphorylated and total protein of ERK, p38 and JNK were determined via Western
  blot analysis. Phosphorylated levels were normalized with the intensity of total
  proteins and are presented in bar graphs. Results are expressed as mean ± SD of
  three independent experiments (*, p < 0.05).
