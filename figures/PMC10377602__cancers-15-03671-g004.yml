caption: SELENOF expression and its related gene signatures correlate with cell cycle
  regulators in breast tumors. (A) Correlation plots generated to analyze the expression
  of SELENOF versus Ki67, p21, or p27 in breast tumors from the METABRIC database,
  n = 1904 samples. Spearman and Pearson coefficients and their respective p-values
  are indicated. (B) The top 400 genes co-expressed (negative correlation in the left
  panel versus positive correlation in the right panel) with SELENOF in breast tumors
  were analyzed for pathway enrichment using the Metascape gene annotation software
  (Metascape.org). The âˆ’log of p-values are shown in the graphs.
