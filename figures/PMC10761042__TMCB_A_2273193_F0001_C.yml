caption: Schematic illustration of the SILAC-based quantitative phosphoproteomic approach.
  (A) Representative Western blot of Ptp1b +/+ and Ptp1b −/− cells. (B) Ptp1b +/+
  and Ptp1b −/− cells were cultured in “light” (red) or “heavy” (blue) medium and
  stimulated with EGF for 15 min. After lysis, the samples were mixed and incubated
  with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies for enrichment of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins.
  Then, the phosphoprotein fraction was digested with trypsin, and phosphopeptides
  were enriched again with TiO2 beads. Phosphopeptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS.
  (C) Proteins identified in this assay were classified according to their cellular
  function.
