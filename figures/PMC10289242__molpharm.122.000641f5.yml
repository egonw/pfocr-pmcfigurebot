caption: PREPL modulates the levels of calnexin, chromogranin A, SNAP25, and VAMP2.
  Levels of calnexin (A), chromogranin A (CgA) (B), SNAP25 (C), and VAMP2 (D), were
  determined by high-throughput microscopy (quantitation on left panels) or by western
  blot analysis (middle and right panels) as described in Materials and Methods using
  either N2A (N2A APP for microscopy analysis of SNAP25 and VAMP2) or shPREPL knockdown
  cells. In the volcano plot, each dot represents a counted cell, and the dashed lines
  represent the mean and standard error. Welch’s t test; ****P < 0.0001. For westerns,
  a representative blot (original in Supplemental Fig. 5) is shown (middle panels).
  (Right panels) Quantification showing that two different shPREPL constructs (shPREPL
  A and shPREPL D) cause a decrease in calnexin, CgA, and VAMP2 and an increase in
  SNAP25 protein levels; PREPL expression in knockdown cells rescues wild-type phenotype.
  One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P
  < 0.001, ns = not significant.
