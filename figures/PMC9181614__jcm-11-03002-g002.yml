caption: Pain pathway and pharmacological interventions. From tissue trauma to central
  sensitization, different analgesics are known to act at various points of pain transmission.
  At the site of injury, local anaesthetics, antihistamines, and anti-inflammatory
  agents can be used for direct pain relief. Opioids and non-opioid drugs including
  morphine, cannabinoids, COX-2 inhibitors, Î±2 agonists, gabapentin, acetaminophen,
  and tricyclic anti-depressants (TCAs) act both peripherally as well as centrally,
  hence attenuating the transmission of pain signaling.
