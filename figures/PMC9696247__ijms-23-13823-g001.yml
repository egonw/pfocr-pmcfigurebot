caption: 'Schematic Representation of the Coordinated Regulation of the Mammalian
  Target of Rapamycin and Mitophagy in Muscle Protein Synthesis and Degradation. In
  the presence of growth factors (e.g., insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1, growth
  hormone), the phosphoinositide 3-kinases-protein kinase B (PI3K) is activated and
  triggers muscle protein synthesis via the mammalian target of rapamycin complex
  1 (mTORC1). The latter complex is also positively modulated by amino acid availability.
  Conversely, downregulation of PI3K signaling induces translocation of Forkhead box
  O (FoxO) into the nucleus, where it regulates the transcription of the ubiquitin-ligases
  muscle ring finger 1 (MuRF1) and muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx) genes. The activation
  of this signaling pathway induces degradation of sarcomere components and ignites
  a muscle pro-atrophy response. The same degradative molecular program is also triggered
  by fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) in the setting of mitochondrial dysfunction
  and oxidative stress. In this case, the release of FGF21 stimulates the expression
  of the mitophagy-related protein B-cell lymphoma 2 interacting protein 3, paralleled
  by recruitment of the phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) through
  the translocases of the inner and the outer membranes and its activation at the
  site of depolarized mitochondria. This event promotes the sequestration of the E3
  ubiquitin ligase Parkin at the outer mitochondrial membrane and guides the clearance
  of dysfunctional organelles. Finally, depolarized mitochondria are coated and prepared
  for disposal by the ubiquitin-binding adaptor protein p62/sequestosome-1 and the
  recruitment of the microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B (LC3). This
  enables the transfer of mitochondria to lysosomes. FoxO-dependent atrophy is also
  pursued when severely damaged and bioenergetically incompetent mitochondria are
  not efficiently removed and, thus, the AMP/ATP ratio increases, which engages 5â€²
  AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Abbreviations: AA, amino acid; AMP, adenosine
  monophosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; GF, growth factor; TIM23, translocase
  of the inner membrane 23; TOM, translocase of the outer membrane. Created with BioRender.com,
