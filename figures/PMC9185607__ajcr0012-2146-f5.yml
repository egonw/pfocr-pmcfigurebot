caption: Gastric cancer with high Apical Junction Pathway score was associated with
  more aggressive clinicopathological characteristics, such as higher AJCC T-category
  (P=0.003) and higher pathological stage (P=0.02) in TCGA cohort. Similar results
  in AJCC T-category and N-category (P<0.01, respectively) were observed in the GSE84437
  cohort. AJCC, American Joint Committee on Cancer; TCGA, the cancer genome atlas.
