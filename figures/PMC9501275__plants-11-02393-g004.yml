caption: Impact of sgRNA positions on the activation of UGT76G1 in transfected protoplasts
  and the effect of UGT76G1 activation on the expression of other rebaudioside A biosynthetic
  pathway genes (UGT74G1 and UGT85C2). qPCR was performed on the stevia protoplast
  transfected with the different RNPs combination of dCas9-VP64 with sgRNAs targeting
  different proximal promoter positions of UGT76G1. (a) Positional impacts of sgRNAs
  on transcriptional activation level of UGT76G1; and (b) Effects of activating UGT76G1
  on the expression of other key biosynthetic pathway genes. The expression was normalized
  with three reference genes; Actin, Aquaporin, and Calmodulin. Bars denoted the mean
  of three biological replications per treatment ± SE (Standard Error). Mean values
  with the same letters are not significantly different based on the student’s t-test
  at p = 0.05.
