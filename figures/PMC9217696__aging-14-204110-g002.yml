caption: Expression of miR-19a-3p in breast cancer. (A) Bioinformatics analysis showed
  that miR-19a-3p could target ESR1 and CYP19A1. (B) The expression levels of miR-19a-3p
  in plasma of 70 normal women and 98 breast cancer patients were detected by RT-QPCR,
  using U6 as internal reference and analyzed by Mann Whitney test.****P<0.0001. (C)
  The expression levels of miR-19a-3p in plasma of 12 patients with ER negative breast
  cancer and 56 patients with ER positive breast cancer were detected by RT-QPCR,
  using U6 as internal reference and analyzed by Mann Whitney test.*P<0.05. (D) RT-QPCR
  was used to detect the expression levels of miR-19a-3p in normal breast epithelial
  cells and 4 breast cancer cell lines. With U6 as internal reference, 3 replicates
  were performed for 3 times each time. **P<0.01, ****P<0.0001. (E) Kaplan-Meier curve
  of overall survival of breast cancer patients with low expression (n = 560) and
  high expression (n = 188) of miR-19a-3p.
