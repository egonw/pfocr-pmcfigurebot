caption: Impact of PD-L1 on oncogenic signaling pathways and cell cycle regulatory
  genes. (a) Ectopic PD-L1 expression led to increased phosphorylated levels of ERK
  in both H2170 and H1299 cells, as revealed by Western blotting (WB). β-actin was
  used as a loading control. PD-L1-positive transfectants 3, 6, and 7 were from H2170;
  PD-L1-positive transfectants 16, 17, and 22 were from H1299. (b) H2170 PD-L1-positive
  transfectants 3, 6, and 7 showed higher protein expression levels of active β-catenin
  compared to control cells. (c) Knockdown of PD-L1 in H157 cells resulted in decreased
  phosphorylated Akt. (d) Significantly enhanced Wnt/β-catenin activity in PD-L1-overexpressing
  H2170 cells, as determined by TCF/LEF reporter gene assays. The activity of mock-transfected
  H2170 cells treated with DMSO was set to 1. SKL2001 is an agonist of the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway. (e) Increased expression levels of Wnt/β-catenin pathway downstream target
  genes in H2170 after PD-L1 transfection, revealed by real-time RT-PCR analysis.
  Alteration of cell cycle regulatory gene expression in PD-L1-transfected H2170 (fi)
  and H1299 (fii), compared to control cells, using real-time RT-PCR analysis. * p
  < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 when analyzed using Student’s t-test.
