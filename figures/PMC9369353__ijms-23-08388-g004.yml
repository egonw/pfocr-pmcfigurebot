caption: MAPK signaling pathways are involved in pro-inflammatory immune response
  of BV-2 microglial cells stimulated by rNfCB. (a) mRNA expression. BV-2 microglial
  cells were pre-treated with different concentrations (1 µM or 10 µM) of JNK inhibitor
  (SP600125), p38 inhibitor (SB239063), or ERK inhibitor (U0126) for 3 h. rNfCB (100
  µg/mL) was then administered to the cells. The mRNA expressions of TNF-α, IL-1α,
  IL-1β, and IL-6 were analyzed via semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Bar graphs indicate
  the quantitative expression profile of each gene, represented as -fold induction
  of each gene relative to GAPDH in three independent experiments. (b) Quantitative
  ELISA. Production of TNF-α and IL-6 were measured using ELISA. Values are presented
  as mean ± SD of three independent experiments. One-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post
  hoc test was performed as multiple comparisons with the control, treated with rNfCB.
