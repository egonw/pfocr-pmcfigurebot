caption: RNA-seq analysis of the differential changes between olaparib-Ga- and olaparib-treated
  HRR-proficient ovarian cancer cells. (A) Heatmap showing 3109 differentially expressed
  genes in OVCAR3 cells following treatment with olaparib-Ga or olaparib. (B) Top
  six most significant KEGG pathways between olaparib-Ga- and olaparib-treated groups.
  Red, activated; green, inhibited. (C) RT-qPCR validation of the 29 genes in SKOV3
  and OVCAR3 cells treated with olaparib or olaparib-Ga for 48 h. (D) RT-qPCR validation
  of the 10 top genes of the MAPK pathway in SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells treated with olaparib
  or olaparib-Ga. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; NS, not significant.
