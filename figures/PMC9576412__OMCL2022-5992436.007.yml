caption: 'H/R-induced pyroptosis and apoptosis depended on ER stress in vitro. 5 mM
  of 4-PBA was taken to handle the HK-2 cells 24 h before H/R treatment as described
  previously. (a) The influence of 4-PBA on GRP78, CHOP, and caspase-12 proteins in
  H/R injury was verified by western blot analysis. (b) The levels of caspase-1 activity
  in the four groups. (c) 4-PBA application obviously decreased the relative mRNA
  levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, and ASC. (d, e) The rising levels of specific protein
  markers of pyroptosis in H/R injury declined after restraining ER stress by 4-PBA.
  (f, g) The apoptosis rate in relevant groups was revealed by the flow cytometry.
  (h) Protein levels of Bcl-2 and cleaved caspase-3 as well as BAX. Values measured
  during cellular experiments were carried out as mean ± SD, n = 3. ∗P < 0.05, compared
  with the control group; #P < 0.05, versus the DMSO+H/R group.'
