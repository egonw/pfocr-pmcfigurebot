caption: 'AThe formation of the PI+4 isotopologue during the incubation of HEK293
  cells with 18O‐water in the presence of 100 μM carbachol (solid lines) or vehicle
  (broken lines) added at t = 0. Data are represented as individual points with bisecting
  lines (n = 2) from a single experiment, representative of three similar experiments.BThe
  formation of the PI+4 isotopologue during the incubation of MCF7 cells with 18O‐water
  in the presence of 25 μM ATP (solid lines) or vehicle (broken lines) added at t = 0.
  Data are represented as mean ± SEM of four independent experiments.CThe formation
  of the indicated DG species in MCF7 cells stimulated with 25 μM ATP added at t = 0.
  For comparison, the steady‐date levels of the unlabelled PI species at t = 0 are
  shown on the right axis. Data are represented as mean ± SEM of three independent
  experiments.DThe formation of the PA+4 isotopologue during the incubation of MCF7
  cells with 18O‐water in the presence of 25 μM ATP (solid lines) or vehicle (broken
  lines) added at t = 0. Data are represented as mean ± SEM of four independent experiments.EFold
  changes in the indicated PIP2+0 isotopologues during the incubation of MCF7 cells
  with 18O‐water in the presence (solid lines) or absence (broken lines) of 25 μM
  ATP added at t = 5 min. Data are represented as individual points with bisecting
  lines (n = 2) from a single experiment, representative of three similar experiments.FThe
  fractional enrichment of the PI+4 isotopologue during the incubation of MCF7 cells
  with 18O‐water in the presence of 25 μM ATP (solid lines) or vehicle (broken lines)
  added at t = 0. Data are represented as mean ± SEM from four independent experiments.
  The AUCs from time 0 to 15 min were analysed with a one‐way ANOVA with the Geisser–Greenhouse
  correction, followed by Dunnett''s multiple comparisons test (adjusted P‐values
  vs. C38:4 are indicated next to the species'' name).G, HFormation of the indicated
  PA+4 and PI+4 isotopologues in WT or CDS2‐KO MCF7 clones incubated with 18O‐water
  in the presence or absence of 25 μM ATP for 15 min. Data are means ± SEM from a
  typical experiment using independently derived clones (WT n = 3, CDS2‐KO n = 5).I,
  JThe fractional enrichments for the indicated PA+4 and PI+4 isotopologues normalised
  to that of C34:1; this was done to minimise clonal variation and to visualise the
  enrichment in the C38:4 species vs. other species. Data were pooled from independent
  experiments (n = 3) using multiple clones (WT n = 4, CDS2‐KO n = 5). A two‐way ANOVA
  followed by Sidak''s multiple comparisons correction was used to test the differences
  between genotypes (*P ≤ 0.05 vs. WT, ***P ≤ 0.001 vs. WT).KThe formation of the
  indicated PI+3 isotopologues during the incubation of HEK293 cells with 13C6‐glucose
  in the presence of 100 μM carbachol (solid lines) or vehicle (broken lines) added
  at t = 0. Data are represented as individual points with bisecting lines (n = 2)
  from a single experiment, representative of 3 similar experiments.LThe formation
  of the indicated PI+3 isotopologues during the incubation of MCF7 cells with 13C6‐glucose
  in the presence of 25 μM ATP (solid lines) or vehicle (broken lines) added at t = 0.
  The C38:4‐PI+3 signal was below the limit for quantification. Data are represented
  as individual points with bisecting lines (n = 2) from a single experiment, representative
  of 2 similar experiments. Data information: See also Fig .'
