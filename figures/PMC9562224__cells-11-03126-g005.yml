caption: CPP induces HDFs to differentiate into vascular endothelial cells by inhibiting
  the oxidation of PHD2 at Cys302. (a) HDFs were transfected with pCDNA-his6 (ctr),
  pCDNA-his6-PHD2 (wt), pCDNA-his6-PHD2-C302A (mut1), pCDNA-his6-PHD2-C323A (mut2)
  and pCDNA-his6-PHD2-C326A (mut3) for 24 h, and then were treated with CPP (10 μM)
  for 48 h, after which the activity of PHD2 was tested using a human PHD2 ELISA detection
  kit. (b–e) Western blot analysis of the protein level of HIF-1α in HDFs transfected
  with pCDNA-his6-PHD2 (wt), pCDNA-his6-PHD2-C302A (mut1), pCDNA-his6-PHD2-C323A (mut2)
  or pCDNA-his6-PHD2-C326A (mut3) plasmids and treated with CPP (10 μM). β-actin (ACTB)
  was used as a loading control. (f–j) HDFs were transfected with pCDNA-his6 (ctr),
  pCDNA-his6-PHD2 (wt), pCDNA-his6-PHD2-C302A (mut1), pCDNA-his6-PHD2-C323A (mut2)
  or pCDNA-his6-PHD2-C326A (mut3) for 24 h, and were then treated with CPP (10 μM)
  for 48 h, after which the mRNA levels of Vimentin, CD31, VEGF, FGF-2 and PDGF-BB
  were analyzed by qRT-PCR. Data are presented as means ± SEM, * p < 0.05, ** p <
  0.01, *** p < 0.001, n = 3.
