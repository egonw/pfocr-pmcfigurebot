figure_title: YAP promotes inflammatory response during Staphylococcus aureus infection
caption: 'HEK293 cells were cultured and infected, as described in Fig. . A nCounter
  NanoString host response inflammatory gene expression in the four groups; depicted
  genes were selected if at least one comparison between two groups gave a corrected
  p value <0.01, and they must be related to chemokine, cytokine, prostaglandin, or
  inflammasome signaling as indicated (n = 3/group). B Volcano plot representation
  of differential gene expression in YAP−/− infected group versus the baseline of
  WT infected group; depicted genes are chemokine and cytokine (red circle), leukotriene
  and prostaglandin (green square), and inflammasome (blue triangle) pathway genes
  differentially expressed. C RT-qPCR quantification of IL6, CXCL8, PTGS2, and IL1B
  expression normalized to HPRT expression (n = 9/group). D IL-8 level in cell supernatant
  (pg/mL) assessed by ELISA (n = 9/group). Results are expressed as fold change vs.
  control group (only in A, C) and presented as histograms (A) or individual values
  (C, D) with mean ± SD, representing three independent experiments (C, D). WT wild-type,
  SA S. aureus. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test with false discovery rate
  (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons post hoc tests: *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01;
  ***p < 0.001.'
