caption: The GO function enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis results of SDELs-related
  mRNAs in the cerebral cortex of 5×FAD mice. GO annotation results of the top 10
  BPs, CCs, and MFs related to upregulated (a–c) and downregulated (e–g) mRNAs are
  shown. The bubble size represents the number of targets enriched in each entry,
  while the color represents the enrichment significance based on the corrected p-value.
  The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis results of upregulated (d) and downregulated
  (h) mRNAs. Each line represents one gene; a line connecting two pathways indicates
  that the gene is jointly enriched in both pathways. The wider the connecting line,
  the greater the number of shared genes. Different pathways are presented in different
  colors.
