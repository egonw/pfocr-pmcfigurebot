figure_title: HK-2-specific RCAN1 overexpression aggravated HR injury
caption: A HK-2 cells were transfected by empty vector and pCMV-EGFP-RCAN1 (RCAN1OVE)
  for 24 h or 48 h, and the protein level of GFP-RCAN1 was assayed by Western blotting
  (n = 3). B HK-2 cells were used with HR and then treated with or without RCAN1OVE,
  and protein levels of GFP-RCAN1, p-JNK, t-JNK, p-Mff, and Mff were assayed by Western
  blotting (n = 5). C Representative Co-IP analysis of GFP-RCAN1, JNK, and Mff in
  HK-2 cells under RCAN1OVE (n = 3). D The expression levels of GFP-RCAN1, Pro-caspase-3,
  Cle-caspase-3, Pro-caspase-9, Cle-caspase-9, Bax, and Bcl-2 were detected by Western
  blotting (n = 5). E Mitochondrial morphology of HK-2 was assessed by MitoTrackerTM
  Deep Red staining, and the average length of mitochondria was measured. Scale bar,
  10 μm. n = 3. F Western blotting was performed to analyze the expression of GFP-RCAN1,
  p-Drp1S616, Drp1, Fis1, Mfn1, Mfn2, and Opa1 in HK-2 cells (n = 5). G The proteins
  of mitochondria were fractionated, and Western blotting was performed to analyze
  the expression of mito-Drp1, mito-Mfn1, mito-Mfn2, and mito-Opa1, and COX IV was
  used as the loading control for mitochondria (n = 5). H Mitochondrial ROS levels
  were detected by MitoSOX and then analyzed by confocal microscopy. Scale bar, 25 μm.
  n = 3. I ATP production was measured to reflect mitochondrial function. n = 3. *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01.
