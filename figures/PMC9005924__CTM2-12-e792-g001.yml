caption: Sex‐determining region Y‐related high‐mobility group box 2 (SOX2) inhibited
  cGAS/STING signalling in non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). (A‐C) The expressions
  of SOX2 linked to signals including T‐cell mediated immunity, type I interferon
  (IFN) signalling and negative regulation of immune system process (false discovery
  rate [FDR] < .05). (D) Heat map of cGAS/STING representative gene expression between
  the low and high SOX2 expression groups. (E) SOX2 was significantly downregulated
  by shRNAs in PC9 cells for RNA sequence (RNA‐seq) (F) RNA‐seq revealed the correlation
  between SOX2 silencing and cGAS/STING pathway. (G) The mRNA levels of cGAS and STING
  were detected by quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction (qRT‐PCR) after
  si‐SOX2 transfection in NSCLC cells. (H) Representative immunofluorescence of cGAS
  and STING in PC9 and H1975 cells transfected with si‐SOX2. Scale bar, 50 μm. (i)
  Representative immunoblotting of cGAS, STING, p‐IRF3 and IRF3 after SOX2 silencing.
  (J) The mRNA levels of IFNβ, CCL5 and CXCL10 were detected by qRT‐PCR in SOX2‐deficient
  cells. (K) The secretion of IFNβ, CCL5 and CXCL10 were assayed by enzyme‐linked
  immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in PCAT1‐deficient cells. n = 3; *, p < .05; **, p < .01
