caption: The inhibition of TCF promotor activation of the Wnt pathway plasmid reporter
  system in SW480 (A) and HT-29 (B) cell lines. CHIR 99021 was used as a pathway inductor
  and iCRT14 as an inhibitor. Treatment exposure was 24 h after transfection. Values
  are expressed as the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments. Two-way ANOVA,
  difference to non-treated cells, * p ≤ 0.05 and ** p ≤ 0.01.
