caption: Cell-type specific gene expression changes reveal dysregulated pathways in
  aging ovariesIngenuity Pathway Analysis performed on all cluster DEG lists demonstrated
  a shared functional aging signature among cell clusters. (corpus luteum-regressing,
  CL-R; corpus luteum progressing, CL-P). EIF2 signaling, regulation of eIF4 and p70S6K
  signaling, mTOR signaling, and sirtuin signaling were all significant (FDR ≤0.05)
  in all clusters. Corpus luteum-R, stroma, and epithelium 1 share several other significant
  pathways including estrogen receptor signaling, oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial
  dysfunction, remodeling of epithelial adherens junctions, NRF2-mediated oxidative
  stress response, and BAG2 signaling.
