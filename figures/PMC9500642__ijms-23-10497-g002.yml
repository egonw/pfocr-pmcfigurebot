caption: 'LPAR1/3 or LPAR1 inhibitor treatment inhibited LPA−induced changes in the
  expression levels of EMT markers and fibrotic factors. (A,B) HK-2 cells were treated
  with the vehicle or 20 μM LPA for 24, 48, and 72 h. (A) Cellular morphology was
  observed using light microscopy. Original magnification, 100×. Red circles indicate
  cells with an elongated spindle-shaped morphology. (B) Protein levels of E-cadherin
  and vimentin were measured using Western blotting, and representative images of
  the blots (left) and quantification bar graphs (right) are shown. (C,D) HK-2 cells
  were treated with 20 μM LPA in the presence or absence of 20 μM ki16425 (Ki) or
  10 μM AM095 (AM) for 48 h. Protein levels of (C) E-cadherin (E-cad) and vimentin,
  and (D) fibronectin (FN) and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) were measured using Western
  blotting, quantified using ImageJ software, and normalized to that of β-actin. Representative
  images (left) and quantitative analysis bar graphs (right) are shown (n = 3–4 independent
  experiments). Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 vs.
  Con; # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, ### p < 0.005 vs. LPA.'
