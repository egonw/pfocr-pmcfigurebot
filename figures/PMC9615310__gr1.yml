caption: Biogenesis and catabolism of H2S and cysteine. The upper part shows the methylation
  and remethylation cycle of methionine. Transsulfuration of homocysteine to cysteine
  involves two enzymes, that serve additional functions in H2S biogenesis. Cysteine
  catabolism is divided into the oxidative branch leading to taurine and sulfate as
  well as the H2S-dependent pathway leading to the formation of thiosulfate and sulfate.
  Both branches of cysteine catabolism produce sulfite as an intermediate, which –
  similar to H2S – is oxidized within mitochondria. H2S synthesis and catabolism is
  tightly associated with persulfidated species such as glutathione- or cysteine-persulfides,
  that are again formed by different pathways. Deficiencies of enzymes highlighted
  in green are targeted in this study. SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine;
