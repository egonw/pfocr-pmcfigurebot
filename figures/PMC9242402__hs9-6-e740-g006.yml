caption: 'Fatty acid oxidation sustains HSCs. FAO, a key catabolic pathway for energy
  production, fuels the TCA cycle rather than glycolysis. Long-chain fatty acids are
  first activated in the cytosol in fatty acyl-CoA, and then transported by the carnitine
  shuttle system, which is composed by CPT1, CACT, and CPT2, into the mitochondria.
  Here, β-oxidation through multi-step reactions generates acetyl-CoA, which fuels
  the TCA cycle. Mitochondrial FAO is critical for HSC maintenance: PML regulates
  the PPARδ, through the transcription factor PGC1α. PPARδ is a regulator of FAO,
  and its deletion results in loss of HSC reconstitution potential. Template created
  with BioRender.com. CACT = carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase; CPT1 = carnitine
  palmitoyltransferase 1; CPT2 = carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2; FAO = fatty acid
  oxidation; HSC = hematopoietic stem cell; PGC1α = PPARg coactivator-1α; PML = promyelocytic
  leukemia; PPARδ = peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor delta; TCA = tricarboxylic
  acid.'
