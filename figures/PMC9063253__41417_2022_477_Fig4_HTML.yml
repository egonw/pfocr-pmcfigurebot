figure_title: V-ATPase in cell death and cancer
caption: A Anoikis is a mechanism for the elimination of detached cells that can be
  induced by inhibiting V-ATPase or STAT3 in cancer cells. ROS plays the opposite
  role in anoikis according to the stage. B Lysosome-dependent cell death is driven
  by lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), which can be inhibited by V-ATPase.
  C Alkaliptosis is caused by CA9 downregulation and subsequent intracellular pH upregulation
  in cancer cells. Increased interaction between V-ATPase subunit d1 and STAT3 promotes
  JTC801-induced alkaliptosis. D V-ATPase plays a dual role in apoptosis. On the one
  hand, V-ATPase inhibits the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by inhibiting the BAX/BAK1
  complex or increasing TMBIM6-mediated degradation of misfolded proteins via lysosome
  (Lys). On the other hand, V-ATPase-mediated TNFSF10 production triggers CASP8-dependent
  apoptosis. E Ferroptosis is a type of iron-dependent cell death caused by lipid
  peroxidation and oxidative damage of lysosomal membranes to release CTSB. V-ATPase
  inhibits ferroptosis by activating TFEB-dependent SOD production. V-ATPase-mediated
  autophagy may promote ferroptosis by selectively degrading anti-ferroptotic regulators.
