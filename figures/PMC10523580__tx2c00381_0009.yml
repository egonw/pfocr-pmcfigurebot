caption: Schematic representation of pathway analysis results for clusters of the
  CP_DILIs_pos_neg dataset and their link to different hepatic pathologies. Cluster
  numbers are specified in superscript above the involved pathway or hepatic pathology.
  Clusters 6, 27, 31, 35, and 48 are not included in the figure due to the lack of
  informative pathway analysis results. ECM, extracellular matrix; ER, endoplasmic
  reticulum; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; NAFLD, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
