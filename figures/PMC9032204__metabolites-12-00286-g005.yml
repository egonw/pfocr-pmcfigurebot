caption: Metabolomic pathway enrichment and analysis. (A) There are metabolomic pathways
  enrichment of varied metabolites in the 5%, 10%, and 20% HLM feed and basal diet
  control groups (p < 0.05). In terms of their impact value from the largest to the
  smallest, 1 to 14 represented, respectively, following alanine, aspartate and glutamate
  metabolism; taurine and hypotaurine metabolism; D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism;
  glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism; citrate cycle (TCA cycle); purine metabolism;
  glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism; arginine biosynthesis; glutathione metabolism;
  butanoate metabolism; aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis; valine, leucine, and isoleucine
  biosynthesis; biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids; pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis.
  Significant enriched pathways are selected to plot. (B) Integrative analysis of
  metabolites in significantly enriched pathways. The trichromatic diagram was used
  to distinguish these metabolitesâ€™ average abundance. Red and blue represent the
  maximum and minimum abundances for each row (metabolite), respectively.
