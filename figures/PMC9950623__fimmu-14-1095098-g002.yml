caption: Identification of neutrophil-associated differentially expressed genes (NADEGs).
  (A) Comparison of significantly different immune cell infiltration in UC and healthy
  controls. (B) Heatmap of correlations of 22 immune cells in UC samples. Red indicated
  positive correlations and blue indicated negative correlations. (C) Heatmap of the
  correlation between immune cell on module genes by WGCNA. (D) Venn diagram showed
  the neutrophil-associated differentially expressed genes. (E) Subnetwork of core
  genes from the PPI network. Node color reflected the degree of connectivity (red
  color represented a higher degree, and blue color represented a lower degree). (F)
  Interaction pathway between NADEGs by Cluego. The circles represented the main enrichment
  pathways.
