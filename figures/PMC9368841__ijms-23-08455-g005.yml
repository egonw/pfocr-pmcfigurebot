caption: 'Analysis of the pollen phenotype from wild-type (WT) and OsRACK1B-OX transgenic
  plants. (A,C,E), KI-I2 staining showing reduced pollen viability in the OX-1 (C)
  and OX-2 (E) plants compared to that of the WT plant (A). Blue arrowheads indicate
  normal pollen (deep purple color grains), while green arrows indicate abnormal pollen
  (weak red color grains). Percentage pollen viability (L) was calculated based on
  the different colors of pollens from (A,C,E). Bars = 100 μm. (B,D,F), transverse
  section analysis of single locule form anther of WT (B), OX-1 (D), and OX-2 (F).
  Anthers were stained with toluidine blue at mature pollen stage. Number of pollen
  grains per locule was calculated (M). Bars = 50 μm. (G,I,K) Panicles of WT (G) and
  OsRACK1B-OX (I) plants. M, quantitative analysis of grains per locule of anthers
  from WT and RACK1B-OX plants. (H,J) Spikelet phenotype of WT (H) and OsRACK1B-OX
  (J) plants. (K) Panicle phenotype of WT and RACK1B-OX plants. No. of filled grains
  per panicle was calculated (N). Data are means ± SEM of three biological replicates.
  Singleand double asterisks indicate statistical significance: * p < 0.05, ** p <
  0.01, respectively, compared to wild-type (Student’s t-test).'
