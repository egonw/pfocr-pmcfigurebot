caption: CD73 promotes proliferation, migration, invasion, and invadopodia formation
  via the MAPK signaling pathway. A, B, Colony‐formation assay estimating the colony‐formation
  ability of CAL27 and HN4 cells with combined treatment of CD73 knockdown and LM22B.
  C, D,) Wound‐healing assay estimating the migration ability of CAL27 and HN4 cells
  with combined treatment of CD73 knockdown and LM22B. E, F,) Transwell migration
  and invasion assays estimating the migration and invasion ability of CAL27 and HN4
  cells with combined treatment of CD73 knockdown and LM22B. G, H, Fluorescent gelatin
  degradation assay evaluating the invasion ability of invadopodia in CAL27 and HN4
  cells with combined treatment of CD73 knockdown and LM22B. I, J, Western blot detecting
  the expression of markers related to EMT phenotype, proliferation ratio, and invadopodia
  formation in CAL27 and HN4 cells with combined treatment of CD73 knockdown and LM22B.
