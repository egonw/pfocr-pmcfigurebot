caption: Potential mechanisms related to drug‐resistant epilepsy. The blood‐brain
  barrier (BBB) at the brain endothelial cells is the essential structure interface
  that regulates a bidirectional exchange of inflammatory cells and inflammation process
  in pharmacoresistant epilepsy. The neurovascular unit includes endothelial cell,
  pericyte, and endfeet astrocyte. HMGB1 is actively released by neurons, microglia
  and glia, and activates Toll‐like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the receptor for advance
  glycation end products (RAGE), mediating pro‐inflammatory activities on target cells.
  Therefore, there is an increased expression of pro‐inflammatory molecules interleukin
  IL‐1β (IL‐1β) and nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells
  (NFkB). IL‐1β and NFkB rapidly enhances seizure generation. Neuroinflammation signaling
  activation results in brain vessels in areas of serum albumin extravasation which
  denotes BBB dysfunction. The influx of Ca2+ activates the phospholipase A2 (PLA2),
  catalyzing the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway, and synthesizes prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)
  by cyclooxygenase‐2 (COX‐2). Receptors of the nuclear membrane are stimulating,
  where the transcription of the ABCB1 gene that synthesizes P‐glycoprotein (P‐gp)
  in response to excessive glutamate is released by recurrent epileptic activity
