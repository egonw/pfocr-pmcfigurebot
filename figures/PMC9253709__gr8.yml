caption: 'ZBTB18 SF-Nte controls lipid uptake via hypoxia pathway and affects cellular
  metabolism(A) Real-time qPCR of FABP7, an HIF1A target involved in lipid metabolism
  and trafficking, in GBM-derived BTSC233 cells on ectopic expression of ZBTB18 SF-Nte
  or ZBTB18 SF-mut; 18S was used as a housekeeping gene. n = 3; ∗p < 0.05.(B and C)
  Microphotographs (B) and relative quantification (C) showing the uptake of fluorescent
  lauric acid compound (Bodipy-C12) by GBM-derived BTSC475 cells expressing ZBTB18
  SF-Nte or ZBTB18 SF-mut. Values represent mean ± SD, n = 4; ∗∗∗p < 0.001, n.s. not
  significant, according to unpaired t-test (scale bar = 100 μm).(D and E) Microphotographs
  (D) and relative quantification (E) of LD labeled with Bodipy TMR-X in GBM-derived
  BTSC475 cells expressing ZBTB18 SF-Nte or ZBTB18 SF-mut. Values represent mean ±

  qPCR of FABP7 and EGLN3 in GBM-derived BTSC475 cells on ectopic expression of ZBTB18
  SF-Nte or ZBTB18 SF-mut, with or without treatment with hypoxia pathway inhibitor,
  LW6. 72 h on transduction cells were treated with LW6 for an additional 16 h before
  harvesting. TBP was used as a housekeeping gene. Representative experiment, number
  of repetitions: 3.(G and H) Microphotographs (G) and relative quantification (H) showing
  the uptake of fluorescent lauric acid compound (Bodipy-C12) by GBM-derived BTSC475
  cells expressing ZBTB18 SF-Nte or ZBTB18 SF-mut, with or without treatment with
  hypoxia pathway inhibitor, LW6 (scale bar = 100 μm). Cells were treated as in (F).
  Values represent mean ± SD, n = 4; ∗∗∗p < 0.001, n.s. not significant, according
  to unpaired t-test.(I) ATP production rate in GBM-derived BTSC475 cells expressing
  ZBTB18 SF-Nte or ZBTB18 SF-mut, with or without treatment with hypoxia pathway inhibitor,
  LW6. Cells were treated as in (F). Values represent mean ± SD, n = 5.(J) Energetic
  map based on the ATP production basal rates of GBM-derived BTSC475 cells expressing
