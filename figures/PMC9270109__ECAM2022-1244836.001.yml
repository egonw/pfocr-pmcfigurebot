caption: The expression of miR-126 was downregulated in PBMC and lung tissue of NSCLC
  patients. (a) The expression of miR-126 was significantly lower in NSCLC compared
  to health control (P < 0.001, n = 81); (b) expression of the miR-126 was significantly
  higher in lung cancer tissues than lung paracancerous tissues (P < 0.001, n = 30).
