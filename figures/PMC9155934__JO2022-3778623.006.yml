caption: MAP9 promotes cell migration and invasion in vitro. (a) The effect of MAP9
  silencing on cell migration was analyzed by wound-healing assay. (b) The effect
  of MAP9 silencing on cell migration was analyzed by Transwell migration assay. (c)
  The effect of MAP9 silencing on cell invasion was analyzed by Transwell invasion
  assay. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD), and paired Student's
  t-test was employed for data analysis. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
