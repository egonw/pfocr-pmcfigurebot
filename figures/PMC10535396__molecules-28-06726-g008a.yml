caption: 'The mRNA expression of (a) JNK, (b) p38, (c) MKP1, (d) PP2A, (e) PP5 and
  (f) AKT in MAPK signaling pathway. Control: untreated cells; H2O2: cells induced
  with 300 μM hydrogen peroxide for 4 h; PMEE+H2O2: cells pre-treated with PMEE for
  48 h + 4 h exposure to H2O2; CUR+H2O2: cells pre-treated with curcumin for 48 h
  + 4 h exposure to H2O2; PMEE: cells treated with only PMEE; CUR: cells treated with
  only curcumin. The value represents fold changes between control (untreated cells)
  and treatment groups. Data were expressed as the mean ± SD of triplicate experiments;
  means with different letters denote significant difference (p < 0.05).'
