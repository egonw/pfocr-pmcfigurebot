caption: Cluster10 was associated with immunosuppressive TME in bulk level analysis(A)
  The GSEA plot showed Cluster10 was more enriched in senescent cancer cells than
  normal ones.(B) The distribution of Cluster10 in 32 cancer types. The cutoff was
  the median Cluster10 of all samples.(C) The top 20 pathways that had strong correlation
  with Cluster10 in 32 cancer types. The x axis represented the sum of cancer types
  where the correlation between each pathway and Cluster10 > 0.3.(D) The heatmap showed
  the correlation between the immune signatures and Cluster10 in 32 cancer types.(E)
  The heatmap showed the correlation between the 25 SASP factors and Cluster10 in
  32 cancer types.(F) The heatmap showed the correlation between the immune checkpoints
  and Cluster10 in 32 cancer types. TME, tumor microenvironment; GSEA, gene set enrichment
  analysis; SASP, senescence-associated secretory phenotype.
