caption: 'Changes in bile acids with NAFLD progression to fibrosis. (A) Heat map of
  bile acids relative concentrations averaged across all patients within each comparison
  group; 12α-OH: 12α hydroxylated bile acids; ox-BA/epimer: Bile acids with oxidation
  or epimerization at 3, 7 or 12 position. Significantly expressed differences (p
  value ≤ 0.05) are identified by a * symbol. (B) Radar plot for differentially expressed
  bile acids in control, NAFL, NASH and advanced fibrosis. Each pathway expression
  is normalized to the maximum across control, NAFL, and NASH patient groups. Outer
  dashed circle corresponds to the maximum expression of each pathway, middle dashed
  circle to the 0.5*maximum expression, and inner circle to the minimum expression.
  (C) Correlation heatmap of significantly expressed taxa with bile acids increased
  in clinically significant and advanced fibrosis. Only correlations with |ρ| ≥ 0.3
  are highlighted in color. Correlations with p value ≤ 0.1 adjusted for the multiple
  comparisons are denoted by a * sign.'
