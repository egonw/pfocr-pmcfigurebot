caption: GCase from birth to death. (a) Chromosome locus of GBA gene with 14 exons.
  More than 300 GBA variants are associated with GD and around 130 mutations are associated
  with PD []. (b) After GBA is transcribed into mRNA, it becomes synthesized in the
  ER and undergoes post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation []. The
  GCase enzyme attaches to LIMP2 and is guided to the Golgi and lysosomes. LIPM2 levels
  in SN of PD-GBA and iPD do not change [], but levels are reduced in iPD fibroblasts
  and correlate with reduced GCase activity []. (c) After glycosylated-GCase reaches
  the lysosome it becomes activated by saposin C. (d) Activated GCase clears glucosylceramides
  engulfed inside the autophagosome; however, the incorrect conformational state of
  GCase and its deficient activity cause glucosylceramide accumulation in the lysosomes.
  (e) There seems to be a bidirectional effect between glucosylceramide accumulation
  and Lewy body formation. The presence of Lewy bodies is suggested to disrupt correct
  conformational states and trafficking of GCase proteins towards lysosomes [] and
  vice versa, implicating the mutant GCase in αSyn aggregation [,]. (Created with
