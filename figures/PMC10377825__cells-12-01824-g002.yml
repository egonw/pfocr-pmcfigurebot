caption: 'miRNA signature of CD10High sEVs. (A) From 166 MSC-related miRNAs analyzed,
  154 miRNA cargos were present in CD10High sEVs. In CD10High sEVs, nine miRNA cargos
  were predominant (hsa-miR-146a, hsa-miR-4466, hsa-miR-1290, hsa-miR-6089, hsa-miR-1246,
  hsa-miR-3665, hsa-miR-7975, hsa-miR-4516, hsa-miR-4454). (B) Reactome analysis of
  miRNAs highly present in CD10High sEVs showed their involvement in the regulation
  of six gene groups related to gene expression, the immune system, NGF/PDGF/Wnt pathways,
  metabolism of proteins, the cell cycle, and cellular responses to stress (blue spots:
  miRNAs detected in sEVs, black spots: genes related to pathways, yellow spots: genes
  related to pathway that are affected by miRNAs detected in sEVs).'
