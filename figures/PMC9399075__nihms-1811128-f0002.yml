caption: 'Species-level ceramide sources based on CERS enzyme expression profile and
  substrate specificity. Ceramide synthases, the step in the de novo synthesis pathway
  that adds a variable acyl chain to the sphingoid backbone, result in much of the
  diversity of the sphingolipid pool. Varied tissue expression and substrate selectivity
  result in unique tissue distributions of ceramide species. The circulating ceramide
  pool reflects the tissue distribution of the CERS enzymes and their substrate preferences.
  Abbreviations: CERS1–6, ceramide synthases 1–6; VLDL, very-low-density lipoprotein;
  LDL, low-density lipoprotein; HDL, high-density lipoprotein; sEV, small extracellular
  vesicle).'
