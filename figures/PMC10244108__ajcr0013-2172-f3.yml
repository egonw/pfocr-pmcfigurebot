caption: CXCL17 plays a critical role in proliferation and drug-resistance of HCT15
  cells. A, B. CCK-8 assay was performed to detect cell viability after the treatment
  with CXCL17 silence or different concentrations of taxol; C. Wound-healing assay
  for cell migration ability of HCT15 cells upon siNC or si-CXCL17 transfection; D.
  Transwell assay was applied to analyze cell invasion ability; E. Cell cycle was
  detected by flow cytometry; F. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. Scale
  bar was 50 Î¼m. Compared with siNC group, *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01.
article_title: Activation of the IL-17 signalling pathway by the CXCL17-GPR35 axis
  affects drug resistance and colorectal cancer tumorigenesis.
