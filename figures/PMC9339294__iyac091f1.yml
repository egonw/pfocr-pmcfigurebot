caption: 'Tocochromanol biosynthetic pathways in maize. The 2 precursor pathways are
  represented as black boxes. The 6 quantified compounds are indicated in black nonitalicized
  text. The names of key a priori genes are italicized at the pathway step(s) catalyzed
  by their encoded enzyme, with the 13 candidate causal gene loci identified in this
  study in red text. The 5 genes not previously shown to be associated with tocochromanols
  in maize grain are red, bolded, and underlined. Compound abbreviations: DMGGBQ,
  2,3-dimethyl-5-geranylgeranyl-1,4-benzoquinol; DMPBQ, 2,3-dimethyl-6-phytyl-1,4-benzoquinol;
  GGDP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate; GG-Chlorophyll, geranylgeranyl-chlorophyll a;
  HGA, homogentisic acid; HPP, p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate; MEP, methylerythritol 4-phosphate;
  MGGBQ, 2-methyl-6-geranylgeranyl-1,4-benzoquinol; MPBQ, 2-methyl-6-phytyl-1,4-benzoquinol;
  Phytyl-DP, phytyl diphosphate; Phytyl-P, phytyl monophosphate; SAM, S-adenosyl-l-methionine;
  SAH, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine. Gene abbreviations: 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate
  synthase (dxs1 and 2); α-/β-hydrolase family protein (vte7); arogenate/prephenate
  dehydrogenase family protein (arodeH2); phytol kinase (vte5); phytol phosphate kinase
  (vte6); p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (hppd1); protochlorophyllide reductase
  (por1 and 2); homogentisate geranylgeranyltransferase (hggt1); homogentisate phytyltransferase
  (vte2); MPBQ/MGGBQ methyltransferase (vte3); γ-tocopherol methyltransferase (vte4);
  S-adenosylmethionine transporter 1 (samt1); tocopherol cyclase (vte1). The vte7
  locus consists of tandemly duplicated genes (Zm00001d006778 and Zm00001d006779)
  in B73 RefGen_v4.'
