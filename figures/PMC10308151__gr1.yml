caption: 'FXR inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway through activation of TLE3.
  (A) Representative Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining image of TLE3 in normal and
  colon cancer tissue samples from Human Protein Atlas in TCGA cohort, Scale bar 200 μm
  upper panel, 50 μm upper panel. (B) The expression levels of TLE3 in normal colon
  tissues (n = 51) versus primary tumors (n = 647) from COAD and READ cohort of TCGA
  data. Box and whiskers graph is presented within 5–95 percentile, with medium number
  shown in the middle. (C) Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of TLE3 in colorectal
  cancer patients from TCGA. Representative GSEA plots indicated that TLE3 expression
  is positively associated with downregulated signature genes in Colorectal adenoma
  formation pathway gene sets, with significant cut-off defined by false discovery
  rate (FDR) and normalized enrichment score (NES) of TLE3 are indicated. (D) The
  expression levels of FXR in normal colon tissues (n = 51) versus primary tumors
  (n = 647) from COAD and READ cohort of TCGA data. Box and whiskers graph is presented
  within 5–95 percentile, with medium number shown in the middle. (E) Correlation
  between gene expression of TLE3 and FXR genes in normal colorectal tissues from
  TCGA RNA-seq database (n = 50). (F) Immunofluorescent staining of Tle3 expression
  (green) in intestine section of WT and FXRKO mice, with the nucleus counterstained
  with DAPI (blue). Scale bar 25 μm. (G) The expression of Tle3 and Fxr downstream
  targets (Ibabp) are reduced in FXRKO mice, compared with WT mice. (H) The expression
  of Tle3, Fxr target gene (Ibabp), cell cycle gene (Ccnd1), intestinal stem cell
  (ISCs) signature genes (Lgr5 and Ascl2) were measured by RT-qPCR in WT and ApcMin/+
  mice, a classic CRC mouse model, on normal diet treated with FXR agonists, Fexaramine
  D (FexD) from 8 to 16 weeks old. (I) Histogram of FXR binding sites at the promoter
  region of Tle3 genes from both intestine and liver FXR ChIP-seq data. The y-axis
  displays the peak value, and the x-axis shows the chromosomal location of the gene.
  The top panel (displayed in red) represents FXR binding in liver, and the bottom
  panel (displayed in blue) represents FXR binding in intestine. TLE3 is displayed
  above the chromosome-scale are oriented in the sense directions (right arrow). (J)
  HCT116 cells were treated with FXR agonistic drug, FexD and FXR antagonist natural
  bile acids, T-βMCA for 4h. Pooled cells were collected, and ChIP assays were performed.
  Occupancy of FXR at SHP, IBABP, TLE3 promoter regions were detected by q-PCR analysis.
  (K) ApcMin/+ mice were treated with FexD or vehicle for 6 h, intestines were collected,
  and ChIP assays were performed. Occupancy of Fxr at Ibabp and Tle3 promoter regions
  were detected by q-PCR analysis. (L) HCT116 cells were transiently transfected with
  pooled siRNA of TLE3 (siTLE3) and Control (siCTL) for 20 h, then treated with FXR
  agonistic drug, FexD and FXR antagonist natural bile acids, T-βMCA for 4h. The expression
  of TLE3, FXR and its target genes (FXR, IBABP), Wnt signaling gene (CTNNB1), cell
  cycling gene (CCND1), intestinal stem cell markers (LGR5, ASCL2) were measured by
  RT-qPCR. (M) Knockdown of TLE3 by siTLE3 promotes HCT116 cell growth and proliferation,
  as determined by Crystal violet assay. Representative phase-contrast images were
  displayed, Scale bar 100 μm. (N) Silence of TLE3 by siTLE3 increased migratory capabilities
  of HCT116 cells. Wound healing assay was performed, and representative images are
  shown. Scale bar 200 μm. (O) Knockdown of TLE3 by siTLE3 activates Wnt signaling,
  as measured by Cignal TCF/LEF luciferase reporter assay, with provided negative
  and positive control. (P) HCT116 cells were knocked down by siTLE3 and control siRNA.
  Western blot analysis was formed to measure the key Wnt signaling pathway-related
  markers (TLE3, c-MYC, AXIN1). Band intensities were quantified by image J and labeled
  below each band. (Q) Heatmap showing relative gene expression of Wnt signaling inhibitors
  and activators in Lgr5-GFP + stem cells with or without FXR conditional knockdown.
  Lgr5-GFP + cells were isolated from different intestinal segments of APCmin/+/Lgr5-GFP,
  APCmin/+/Lgr5-GFP/FXRflox, (Lgr5-GFP + high cells–Intestinal Stem cells, were isolated
  were pooled from six mice 1 week after tamoxifen treatment). n = 3–9/group. Experiments
  were independently replicated twice, and representative data are shown as the mean ± SEM.
  p-values are computed with Student''s unpaired t-test or one sample Wilcoxon test,
  or one-way ANOVA test followed by multiple comparisons. ∗ FXRKO or ApcMin/+ versus
  WT, or siTLE3 versus siCtl, or Drugs versus control, # FexD versus Vehicle in WT
