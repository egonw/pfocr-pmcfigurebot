caption: Kaplan-Meier survival curves presenting the prognostic relationship between
  high and low expressions of specific genes to overall survival (OS) using the GSE41258
  database patient samples. (a) FABP1 (b) CD36, (c) IRS1 (d) PCK1, (e) THBS1, and
  (f) TGFB1 expressions. Survival curves were plotted using SPSS 22.0. Specific differentially
  expressed gene (DEGS) expression levels were selected by the median value. Results
  are visually presented by Kaplan-Meier survival plots, and p values were calculated
  using log-rank statistics. Number of Patient (n) = 244, p = log-rank p value with
  p < 0.05 considered significant
