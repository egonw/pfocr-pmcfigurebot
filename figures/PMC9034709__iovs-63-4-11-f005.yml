caption: The E3 ligase RNF157 facilitates p53 degradation through the proteasome pathway.
  (A) The proteins were enriched in the positive regulation of intrinsic apoptotic
  signaling pathway. (B, C) Influence of RNF157 on endogenous or exogenous p53 protein
  expression. (D) The qRT-PCR was performed to detect the effects of exogenous RNF157
  on p53 mRNA expression. The values shown are mean ± standard deviation (n = 3).
  ns means not significant. (E) Effect of RNF157 knockdown on the p53 protein level.
  (F) HLE-B3 cells were transfected with empty vector or Flag-RNF157 vector for 36
  hours and then were treated with 10 µM MG132 for 6 hours before Western blotting.
  (G) HLE-B3 cells transfected with empty vector or Flag-RNF157 vector were treated
  with CHX (25 µg/mL) for the indicated durations and analyzed by Western blotting.
  (H) HLE-B3 cells transfected with NC siRNA or RNF157 siRNA were treated with CHX
  (25 µg/mL) for the indicated duration before Western blot analysis. * P < 0.05,
  ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001.
