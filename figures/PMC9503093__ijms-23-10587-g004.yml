caption: WES analysis of mTOR activity, metabolic enzyme expressions, and in situ
  mitochondrial stainings of papillary (ACHN) and clear cell (786-O) renal cell carcinoma
  cell lines. (A) WES analysis of mTOR pathway and metabolic markers in papillary
  (ACHN), clear cell renal cell carcinoma (786-O), and normal tubular epithelial (HK-2)
  cell lines. β-actin was used as loading control. GLS levels were analyzed by a dual-specificity
  antibody showing both the KGA (60 kDa) and GAC (55 kDa) splice variants. Predicted
  protein sizes are provided in Table 2. (B) Higher staining intensity with Mitotracker,
  anti-ATPB, anti-COX IV in ACHN (PRCC) than 786-O (CCRCC) cell lines suggest pronounced
  mitochondrial OXPHOS function in PRCC cells; however, TOM20 stainings showed no
  differences (magnification 63×).
