caption: p-AKK enhances cellular energy currency and reduces fat accumulation. N =
  3. (A) ATP level of C. elegans. (B) Triglyceride content of C. elegans. N = 3. (C)
  Quantification of data shown in (D). N = 10. (D) Oil Red O staining of fixed worms
  and selected intuitive characteristic map. Bar, 200 μm. The results are expressed
  as the mean ± SD and p-values were calculated by Duncan’s tests. Significant differences
  between groups are expressed by different letters (a–c) (p < 0.05).
