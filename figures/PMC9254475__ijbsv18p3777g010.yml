caption: Schematic diagram. a-d EdU incorporation assay was performed to detect the
  proliferation of PANC-1 (a) and CFPAC-1 (c). b and d revealed quantification of
  the data shown in a and c. e The schematic diagram for the overall idea of this
  research. Each experiment was performed three times independently and results are
  presented as mean Â± s.d. Student's t-test was used to analyze the data. (*p < 0.05;
