caption: 'Effect of silencing METTL3 on the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in Fusarium-stimulated
  mouse corneas. Effective silencing of METTL3 was confirmed by mRNA (A) and protein
  (B, C) levels and by immunofluorescence (D). Scale bar: 130 µm. After pretreatment
  with AAV-sh-METTL3 (n = 6) and after pretreatment with siRNAMETTL3, (E) mRNA (E)
  and protein (F, G) levels and immunofluorescence (H) confirmed the effective silencing
  of METTL3. Scale bar: 70 µm. (I, J) Phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway
  members in Fusarium-stimulated mouse corneas. (K, L) Phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathway proteins after Fusarium infection of corneal stromal cells. ns,
  nonsignificant. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001.'
