caption: Transcriptional signatures are generalizable to predict the tumour‐associated
  T cells (TATs) from other single cell datasets. (A) Glycosaminoglycan degradation
  pathway is enriched in TATs, while the purine metabolism pathway is depleted in
  TATs. (B) ROC plot by using a colorectal cancer (CRC) dataset to train the prediction
  logistic regression model and testing the performance of model on the other datasets.
  (C) Permutation analysis by randomizing the true labels of TATs 1000 times and comparing
  the Area Under the Curve (AUC) distribution with the true prediction AUC values
  on each dataset. (D) PD‐1 expression between TATs and non‐clonal T cell group. (E)
  ROC plot using the expression of PD‐1 alone to differentiate TATs from non‐clonal
  T cells. (F) Differential expression analysis between TATs in PBMCs and TILs_Shared
  compartment in tumour‐infiltrated T lymphocytes (TILs)
article_title: TCR repertoire and transcriptional signatures of circulating tumour‐associated
  T cells facilitate effective non‐invasive cancer detection.
