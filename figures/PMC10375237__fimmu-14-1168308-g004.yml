caption: 'Key metabolic modules related to vaccine stimuli and crucial metabolites
  contributed to immune response to vaccination. (A) Pathway enrichment based on validated
  differential metabolites in the discovery and validation sets between T2, T3, T4
  or T5 and T1, as well as between T2 and T3. (B) Differential metabolite correlation
  analyses of serum metabolites in T5 vs. T1 based on metabolomics profiling in the
  whole vaccinated population. Changes of correlation between metabolite-pairs in
  30 days after the second vaccination (T5) relative to before vaccination (T1) were
  calculated. Those with differential correlations with p < 0.05 were subjected to
  construct co-expression network by employing Multiscale Embedded Gene Co-expression
  Network Analysis (MEGENA). The hub nodes were labeled with hexagon shape. (C) Associations
  between Hub metabolites and blood immune cells as well as antibody in different
  timepoints in the vaccinated population with at least a positive antibody at T5
  (T2 vs. T1, T3 vs. T1, T4 vs. T1, T5 vs. T1 and T3 vs. T2) (Spearman correlation
  coefficient, *: p<0·05, **: p<0·01, ***: p<0·001).'
