caption: Immunohistochemical analysis of MAPKs/NF-κB signaling pathway proteins in
  the lungs of DUSP1 knockdown combined with BCG infection in C57BL/6J mice. C57BL/6J
  mice were infected with BCG (2 × 106 CFU/only) by a single direct airway infusion,
  and siRNA-DUSP1 was administered to downregulate DUSP1 expression in the lungs of
  C57BL/6J mice by multiple airway infusions into the mice using in vivo Advanced
  Transfection Reagent. After 21 days of BCG infection, lung tissues were taken from
  mice and immunohistochemically examined for p-p38, p-ERK, p-JNK and p-NF-κB p65
  expression in lung tissue. The samples of mice in each treatment group were 6. Scale
  bar, 40 μm. (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).
