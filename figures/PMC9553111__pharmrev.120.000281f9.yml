caption: Renal proximal tubule cell AT2R/PP2A AB55αC signaling pathway by which receptor
  activation increases cyclic GMP (cGMP) production, inhibits Na+ reabsorption, and
  induces natriuresis. Green arrows indicate stimulation, red arrows depict internalization
  and inactivation, red lines depict inhibition, blue arrows stand for effects on
  ion exchanges by Na+ transporters, and dashed arrows indicate impaired/reduced responses.
  AT2R activation by exogenous nonpeptide agonist C21 stimulates AT2R recruitment
  from intracellular sites to the apical plasma membranes of renal proximal tubule
  cells via PP2A-dependent signaling, reinforcing, and sustaining the natriuretic
  response. AT2R activation via a PP2A AB55αC signaling pathway increases cGMP production,
  which internalizes and inactivates major Na+ transporter molecules Na+-H+-exchanger-3
  (NHE-3) and Na+-K+-ATPase (NKA), counterbalancing AT1R actions to increase Na+ reabsorption
  by stimulating these transporters.
