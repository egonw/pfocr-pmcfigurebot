caption: 'EA at ST36 inhibited apoptosis of cells of the intestinal tissue. (a) The
  expression levels of caspase 3, cleaved caspase 3, Bcl2, Bax, and β-actin were detected
  by the Western blot. Gel-Pro Analyzer software was used to quantify the levels of
  expression of (b) caspase 3, (c) cleaved caspase 3, and (d) Bcl2/Bax. (e) A TUNEL
  assay was used to measure intestinal tissue apoptosis. Cy3 : cyanine 3. Data are
  expressed as mean ± SD. ##P < 0.01 compared with the control group; ∗∗P < 0.01 compared
  with the model group. Modification of signaling through the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway.'
