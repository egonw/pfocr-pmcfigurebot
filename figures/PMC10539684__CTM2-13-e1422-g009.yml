caption: Ying Yang 1 (YY1) promoted prostate cancer (PCa) cell growth and metastasis
  in vivo. (A) Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT qPCR)
  was used to verify the transfection efficiency of YY1. (B) Graphical illustration
  of two in vivo mouse model studies. (C–E) Tumour size (C, D) and weight (E) of the
  subcutaneous tumour growth model injected with transfected PCa cells (5 mice/group).
  (F) Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis (left) and IHC score (right) for YY1 of
  subcutaneous tumour sections. (G) immunofluorescence analysis (right) and quantitative
  bar graph (left) for Ki‐67 of subcutaneous tumour sections. (H) IHC analysis (left)
  and IHC score (right) for N‐cad of subcutaneous tumour sections. (I) Immunofluorescence
  analysis (right) and quantitative bar graph (left) for CD56 of subcutaneous tumour
  sections. (J, K) The effects of YY1 knock out on lung metastasis (J) and the number
  of metastases (K) were examined by hematoxylin‐eosin staining (H&E) staining. (L)
  Overall survival analysis of mice in lung metastasis *p < .05, **p < .01. T, tumour;
  N, normal.
