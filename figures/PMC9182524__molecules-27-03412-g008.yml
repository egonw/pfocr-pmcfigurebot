caption: 'The synergistic effect of CUR and BBR against BC cells by inducing apoptosis.
  Apoptosis in BC cells is induced by a combination of CUR and BBR, mediated through
  the activation of the ERK signaling pathway. These two compounds work together to
  enhance JNK activation, phosphorylation of Bcl-2, and dissociation of the Beclin1/Bcl-2
  complex in BC cells, eventually resulting in autophagic cell death. Bcl-2: B-cell
  lymphoma 2; Bax: BCL2-associated X protein; PARP: poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase;
  JNK: c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinase. This figure
