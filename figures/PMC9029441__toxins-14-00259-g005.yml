caption: The effects of CTN on Ca2+ concentration and ER stress-associated proteins
  expression in the liver of mice. After the liver tissue was homogenized, the supernatant
  was taken to detect the change of Ca2+ content (A). The protein expression levels
  of caspase-12 (B), CHOP (C) and GRP78 (D) in liver tissue were detected by Western
  blot and analyzed using image-J software. The above data are expressed as mean Â±
  SEM. Compared with the control group, ** p < 0.01, * p < 0.05.
