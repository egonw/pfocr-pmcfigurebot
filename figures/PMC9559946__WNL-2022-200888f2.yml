figure_title: Random Forest Regression Tree for the MD in the Cingulum Pathway
caption: The figure represents the recursive partitioning for the MD index in the
  cingulum pathway and the contribution of WML volume to the portioning. Corresponding
  p values are given for each inner node. Boxplot for MD distribution is shown for
  each final group. MD = mean diffusivity; WML volume = white matter lesions based
  on hypointense signal abnormalities of T1-weighted 3D images.
