caption: Reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) shows activation of HER2/HER3 heterodimer
  by analysis of single protein and pathway signaling. Protein expression values were
  normalized within the TCGA breast cancer. The data were z-scored and pathway activity
  was assessed using pathway scores calculated as described previously. The histogram
  represents the distribution of the single protein/phosphoprotein or the pathway
  activity of the TCGA breast cancer cohorts and SMMART cohort as well as the pathway
  activity of the patient’ sample (black line). HER3, total HER3 protein; HER3 pY1289,
  phosphorylated HER3; HER2, total HER2 protein; HER2 pY1248, phosphorylated HER2;
  RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase pathway (cMET_pY1235, EGFR_pY1173, HER2_pY1248, HER3_pY1289,
  IGF1R_pY1135_Y1136, IRS1, Src_pY527, SHP-2_pY542, Shc_pY317, Src_pY416); PI3K_AKT,
  PI3 kinase-AKT pathway (Akt_pS473, Akt_pT308, GSK3αβ_pS21S9, p27_pT198, PRAS40_pT246,
  PTEN).
