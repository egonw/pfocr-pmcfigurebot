caption: Effects of black radish hot water extract (BRHE) on the cell viability and
  NO production of RAW 264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages. The cells were incubated
  for 20 h with different concentrations of BRHE (200, 100, and 50 μg/mL) with or
  without 0.5 μg/mL LPS. The cell viability (A,C) and NO production (B,D) were measured
  using WST assay and Griess assay as described in the Material and Methods. Data
  are expressed as mean ± SD (n = 3) of the three independent experiments. * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01 versus the untreated control group.
