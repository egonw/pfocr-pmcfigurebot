caption: 'Graphical abstract of the effects of treatment with SOP on ISO-induced kidney
  injury: SOP could alleviate ISO-induced kidney injury by inhibiting inflammation,
  apoptosis, oxidative stress and fibrosis; the molecular mechanisms were suppression
  of the TLR-4/NF-κB and TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathways and activation of the Nrf2/HO-1
  signaling pathway.'
