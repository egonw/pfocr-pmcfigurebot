figure_title: Silencing HPSE inhibits proliferation of BRAF V600E-mutant CRC cells
  in vitro and in vivo
caption: 'A Baseline relative expression level of HPSE in different CRC cell lines
  at mRNA level (top) and protein level (bottom). The same trend was observed in three
  independent repeated experiments. Representative results are shown. WT: KRAS/BRAF
  wild type; KRAS MT: KRAS mutant type; BRAF V600E MT: BRAF V600E mutant type. B Verification
  of knockdown of HPSE expression in HT29 and RKO at mRNA level (top) and protein
  level (bottom). The same trend was observed in three independent repeated experiments.
  Representative results are shown. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation.
  NC negative control. C Representative images and statistical analysis of colony
  formation assay. Cells were seeded in six-well plates at 500 cells per well and
  cultured for 14 days. The same trend was observed in three independent repeated
  experiments. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. D Subcutaneous
  xenograft models and tumors isolated on day 24. Each group contained six mice. Subcutaneous
  tumor formation rates of the two groups were 100% (6/6) in the control group and
  33.3% (2/6) in the HPSE silencing group. E Growth curves of subcutaneous tumors
  in nude mice. Points and error bars represent mean ± standard errors. F Weight of
  subcutaneous tumors isolated from models on day 24. Data are presented as the mean ± standard
  deviation. G HE staining and IHC staining of HPSE and Ki67 in subcutaneous tumor
  tissues. Representative images and semi-quantification analysis are shown. Data
  are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. The student’s t-test was used to
  determine the P-value in two-group comparisons. One-way ANOVA analysis and Tukey’s
  test were used for multiple comparisons. ****P < 0.0001, ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01,
  *P < 0.05, ns P > 0.05.'
