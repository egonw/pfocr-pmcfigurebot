caption: Increased gene expressions of VEGF, VEGFR-2, and NP-1 in Erlotinib-resistant
  NSCLC cell lines. For the analysis, 2.5 Ã— 105 H358-P/ER and H2170-P/ER cells were
  plated in Petri dishes and allowed to adhere and grow for 24 h. The cells were then
  starved (RPMI + 0.5% BSA) for 24 h and total RNA was collected. Real-time quantitative
  polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was then performed with three duplicates for each
  target gene as well as with a housekeeping gene (GAPDH). mRNA was quantified and
  analyzed for VEGF, VEGFR-2, and NP-1. The data was normalized with GAPDH and the
  graphical representation is relative to expression of the respective genes in H2170-P
  and H358-P cells. Statistical analyses demonstrated that the results were statistically
  significant (p < 0.05) by way of two-tailed t-test analyses.
