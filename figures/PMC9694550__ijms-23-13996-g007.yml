caption: The metabolic pathway analysis of lactate-treated myoblasts relative to controls.
  Five significantly altered metabolic pathways were identified with two criteria
  of pathway impact values > 0.1 and p values < 0.05 (i.e., âˆ’log10(p) > 1.3), including
  (1) alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism; (2) D-Glutamine and D-Glutamate
  metabolism; (3) glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism; (4) arginine biosynthesis;
  and (5) glutathione metabolism.
