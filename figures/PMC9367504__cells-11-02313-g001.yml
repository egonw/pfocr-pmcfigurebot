caption: 'Schematic representation of TNF-α-signaling pathway in CRC. (1) NF-KB: The
  Binding of TNF-α to TNFR1 facilities the assembly of TNFR1-associated death domain
  (TRADD) complex containing TRAF2 and RIP, which leads to activation of TAK1 and
  I kappa B kinase complex (IKK), comprised of two kinases IKKα and IKKβ, and eventually
  increases nuclear accumulation of NF-kB. (2) AP-1: After binding to TNFR1, TNF-α
  triggers the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein 2 kinases (MAP2Ks) and
  in turn activates Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) and activator protein-1 (AP-1). (3)
  Cell death: TNF-α causes apoptosis or necrosis through caspase enactment by binding
  to TRADD complex to FADD. (4) ERK: Enhancement or upregulation of TROP-2 by TNF-α
  through activating ERK pathway.'
