caption: FOXC1 induces the upregulation of TRIM22 in RA-FLSs. (A) The possible binding
  site between FOXC1 and the TRIM22 promoter was predicted using the JASPAR database.
  FOXC1 mRNA and protein expression levels in RA-FLSs and normal-FLSs was determined
  using (B) RT-qPCR and (C) western blotting. ***P<0.001. Ov-FOXC1 transfection efficiency
  was analyzed using (D) RT-qPCR and (E) western blotting. ***P<0.001 vs. Ov-NC. (F)
  Dual-luciferase reporter assays were performed to assess the luciferase activity
  of TRIM22-WT and TRIM22-MUT following transfection with Ov-FOXC1. ***P<0.001 vs.
  Ov-NC. (G) Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed the abundance of the TRIM22 promoter
  in the FOXC1 antibody fraction. Input was the positive control. ***P<0.001 vs. IgG.
  TRIM22 mRNA and protein expression was assessed using (H) RT-qPCR and (I) western
  blotting, respectively, following FOXC1 overexpression. ***P<0.001 vs. Ov-NC. FOXC1,
  Forkhead box C1; TRIM22, tripartite motif-containing 22; RA, rheumatoid arthritis;
  FLS, fibroblast-like synoviocyte; RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR;
  Ov, overexpression; NC, negative control; WT, wild-type; MUT, mutant.
