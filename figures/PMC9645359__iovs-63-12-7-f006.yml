caption: 'PGB pretreatment prevented mitochondrial impairment and retinal dysfunction
  by the phosphorylation of Akt and inactivation of GSK3β. (A) PGB (30 mg/kg) and
  TWS119 (10 nM) pretreatment improved the structure of mitochondria in the retina
  of RIR mice models; mitochondria are indicated by the yellow arrow (25,000×). Scale
  bars: 500 nm. (B, D) MK2206 (10 nM) reversed the effects of PGB and decreased the
  thickness of the RNFL and GCC, and TWS119 maintained the effects of PGB and reserved
  the increased thickness of RNFL and GCC. Scale bars: 200 µm. (C, E) Representative
  ERG waveforms in living mice. MK2206 disrupted the visual function balance of RGCs
  in the presence of PGB, with a decrease in the amplitudes of OPs and PhNRs. However,
  TWS119 maintained the normal level of the amplitudes of OPs and PhNRs (n = 6). *P
  < 0.05 versus control group; **P < 0.05 versus NaCl + RIR group; ***P < 0.05 versus
  30-mg/kg PGB + DMSO + RIR group.'
