caption: 'Sufentanil regulates the ERK/GSK-3β signaling pathway in CLP rats. (a) Western
  blot for detecting the level of ERK/GSK-3β signaling pathway-related proteins (p-ERK,
  ERK, p-GSK-3β, and GSK-3β) in myocardial tissues of rats in each group; (b) image
  J software utilized to analyze the ratios of p-ERK/ERK and p-GSK-3β/GSK-3β in myocardial
  tissues of rats in each group, ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. the Sham group, #P < 0.01 vs. the
  CLP group.'
