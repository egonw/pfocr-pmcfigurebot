caption: Deletion of sost induced compensation of Wnt signaling by upregulation of
  Wnt signaling inhibitors. (A) Nuclear separation Western blotting (composite image
  from the same blot) showed a decreased amount of active β‐catenin in the cell nuclei
  of the sost KO, using histone 3 as control (n = 5/group). (A') Quantitative measurement
  of β‐catenin protein expression from Western blot. Unphosphorylated (active) β‐catenin
  at 92 kDa, histone 3 at 17 kDa, β‐Actin at 92 kDa. (B) Whereas β‐catenin is unchanged,
  dkk1 and sfrp4, both inhibitors of the pathway, were increased in response to sost
  deletion. Student's t tests compared groups, with significance noted below p < 0.05.
