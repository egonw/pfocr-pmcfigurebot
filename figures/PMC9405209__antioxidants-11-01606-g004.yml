caption: Interaction between oxidative stress proteins and transcription factors at
  the proteomic level. (A) Heatmap shows the upregulated and downregulated transcription
  factors in nerves between 1DIV and NEM/1D. (B) qPCR validation of the transcription
  factors obtained from (A) using ex vivo mouse sciatic nerves. Red bars, blue bars,
  and green bars represent upregulated, downregulated, and mixed genes compared with
  proteomics data. RNA-sequencing, Seq. (C) Heatmap was constructed for the significantly
  different oxidative stress proteins in nerves between 1DIV and NEM/1D. (D) Validation
  of significantly differentially expressed oxidative stress proteins using qPCR.
  One upregulated and eight downregulated oxidative stress proteins were validated.
  RNA-sequencing, Seq. (E) Interaction network between oxidative stress proteins and
  transcription factors. Among the connecting lines, the red lines indicate the interaction
  between oxidative stress proteins and transcription factors. Gray nodes represent
  proteins interacting with oxidative stress proteins. Comparisons were performed
  using a Studentâ€™s t-test. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001.
