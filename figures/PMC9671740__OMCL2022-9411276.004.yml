caption: 'miR-182/183 targets DCC and negatively regulates DCC: (a) Venn diagram of
  the predicted target genes of miR-182 and miR-183 by the RNA22 database. The blue
  circle represents the prediction result of miR-182, the red circle represents the
  prediction result of miR-183, and the middle part represents the intersection of
  the two sets of data. (b–d) GO function analysis of miRNA target gene prediction
  results; (b–d) enrichment results of three GO functional groups: biological process
  (BP), cellular component (CC), and molecular function (MF). The abscissa indicates
  the generation, and the ordinate indicates the name of entry identifiers. The circle
  size and color in the figure indicate the number of genes in the entry identifier
  and the p value, respectively. (e) KEGG enrichment analysis of metabolic pathway
  in relation to miRNA target gene prediction results; (f) Western blot analysis of
  DCC protein in the hippocampal tissues of SZ (n = 8) and normal (n = 8) rats; (g)
  the binding site between miR-182/183 and DCC predicted by the bioinformatics website
  https://cm.jefferson.edu/rna22/; (h) binding of miR-182/183 to DCC determined by
  dual-luciferase reporter assay; (i) Western blot analysis of DCC protein in the
  hippocampal neurons treated with miR-182/183 mimic or AntimiR-182/183. The data
  in the figure were measurement data, expressed as the mean ± standard deviation,
  and analyzed by an independent sample t-test. ∗p < 0.05vs. the normal or miR-182/183
  mimic-NC group. #p < 0.05vs. the AntimiR control group. The cell experiments were
  repeated three times independently.'
