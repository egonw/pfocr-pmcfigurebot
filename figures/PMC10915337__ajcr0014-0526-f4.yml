caption: Signalling intercellular communication and specific gene signature in CAF2
  subset. A. Input and output signalling pathways for each cell type. B-F. The CD46
  signalling pathway, CD99 signalling pathway, COLLAGEN signalling pathway, GAS signalling
  pathway and ncWNT signalling pathway in CAF2 communicate more closely with the microenvironment.
  G. Significantly relevant ligand-receptor interactions between CAF2 and most communicating
  cell types.
