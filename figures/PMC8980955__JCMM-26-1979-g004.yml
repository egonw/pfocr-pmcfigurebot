caption: 'SIRT1 alleviates acute kidney injury and apoptosis. (A) Representative haematoxylin
  and eosin‐stained (H&E) kidney sections of C57BL/6 mice which underwent LPS administration
  and were treated with SRT‐1720 or EX‐527 (scale bars, 50μm). (B) Histopathological
  score of H&E staining of renal tissue. Quantitative analysis of BUN (C), Scr (D),
  KIM‐1 (E) and NGAL (F) in the different groups. (G‐H) Representative images of the
  TUNEL staining on kidneys (scale bars, 100 μm) and statistical percentages of TUNEL‐positive
  cells. (I‐M) Representative Western blots and statistical results of the protein
  expressions of SIRT1, Bax, Bcl‐2 and cleaved‐caspase3. Each result was replicated
  in three independent experiments, and all values are the mean ±SD (n = 3). *Significance
  compared with CON group (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01). #Significance compared with LPS
  group (#p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01)'
