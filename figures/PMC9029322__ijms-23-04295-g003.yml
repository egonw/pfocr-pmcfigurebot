caption: 'Gene expression levels of inhibitor target genes in cell lines and control.
  The different sensitivities to MK-2206 (a) and Buparlisib (b) are indicated for
  each cell line. Gene expression levels are displayed as Log2 (TPM + 1). Control:
  non-neoplastic pancreatic tissue. Gene expression in normal pancreatic tissue comes
  from GTEx and TCGA databases.'
