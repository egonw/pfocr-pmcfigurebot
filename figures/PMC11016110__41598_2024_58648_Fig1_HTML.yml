caption: Experimental methods. (A) Experimental design of the cued response inhibition
  task (CRIT). Sessions begin with simultaneous presentation of an inhibit action
  cue (variable time 5–30 s), and an action cue which remained lit for 10 s following
  cessation of the inhibit action cue. Created with Biorender.com. (B) Schematic of
  chemogenetic methods. DREADDs receptors were expressed in DMS projecting OFC neurons
  by injecting CAV/2 Cre (green) bilaterally in the DMS and inhibitory DREADDs receptors
  (red) in the OFC. (C) Robust expression of both viruses in their respective brain
  regions is observed. (D) Administration of CNO (10 mg/kg) suppresses firing rate
  (Z-scored) in a spontaneously active population of OFC neurons (not limited to DREADDs
  expressing units) under isoflurane anesthesia. (E) Compared to saline control (light
  grey), CNO injection (dark grey) produced a significant and sustained modulation
  of OFC firing rate.
