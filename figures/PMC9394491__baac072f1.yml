caption: Scheme of the data collection and analysis for Phosprof. (Left) A drug from
  the Selleck L2400 Library was added to the cell culture media 2 h prior to the harvest
  of the cell lysate, which was then applied to a protein array with ATP. The tyrosine
  residues of the proteins on the array are phosphorylated by the cell lysate and
  detected using 4G10 antibody. (Right) The resultant ‘phosphorylation profiles’ were
  then analyzed to identify the significant pathways. The collected data can be browsed
  using various pathway analysis tools.
