caption: 'Characterization of acetylation changes in non-histone proteins following
  the reduction in HDAC activity. (A) Pie-charts depicting the proportions of peptides
  with up- (violet), down- (orange) or non-significant (blue) changes in acetylation
  in MS-275, SAHA and Hdac1 KO SC samples compared to control (LIMMA test, p-value
  < 0.05, FC > 1.5). For each category, the number of peptides (#) and the peptide
  quantity are indicated. For certain proteins, both significantly up- and downregulated
  acetylated peptides were identified. Those peptides are grouped separately and corresponding
  up- and downregulated peptides are colored in dark violet and dark orange. (B) Number
  of proteins in individual categories based on identified acetylated peptides in
  MS-275, SAHA and Hdac1 KO SC samples compared to control (LIMMA test, p-value <
  0.05, FC > 1.5). Certain proteins with up- or downregulated peptides included also
  other peptides with unchanged acetylation levels. (C) Venn diagrams depicting shared
  proteins with up- or downregulated acetylation in MS-275, SAHA and Hdac1 KO SC samples
  compared to control (LIMMA test, p-value < 0.05, FC > 1.5). Proteins with both up-
  and downregulated acetylation sites were included in both groups. (D) REACTOME pathway
  analysis of proteins with upregulated acetylation levels in MS-275, SAHA and Hdac1
  KO SC samples compared to control (LIMMA test, p-value < 0.05, FC > 1.5), using
  the STRING network analysis tool. (E) The protein network for proteins with upregulated
  acetylation detected in MS-275 sample compared to control (LIMMA test, p-value <
  0.05, FC > 1.5), where proteins involved in homology directed repair, cell cycle
  and chromatin modifiers are highlighted. (F) Detection of γH2AX levels and cleavage
  of PARP by Western blot in CTRL, Hdac1 KO, Hdac1 KO SC, SAHA and MS-275 samples,
  following the 16 and 48 h treatment of SAHA and MS-275 sample with respective IC50
  concentrations. (G) Characterization of apoptotic cells in CTRL, Hdac1 KO, Hdac1
  KO SC, SAHA and MS-275 samples. Analyzed in triplicates. Above: fractions of live,
  early apoptotic, late apoptotic and necrotic cells are shown. Below: fraction of
  late apoptotic cells is shown. Data are represented as mean ± SD, * p < 0.05.'
