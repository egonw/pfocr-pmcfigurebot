caption: ETBP enhances MAPK signaling pathway and macropinocytosis in cancer cells.
  (A-C) Western blot assays of SDC4 in PANC1 (A), AsPC1 (B), and CFPAC1 (C) cells
  treated with ETBP at the indicated concentrations. (D) Western blot assays of phosphorylated
  and total ERK, AKT, and p38 in PANC1 cells upon ETBP treatment for 12 hours. Quantification
  analysis of the triplicate experiments is shown. (E-G) Representative macropinocytosis
  images of PANC1 (E), BxPC3 (F), and AsPC1 (G) cells treated with ETBP at the indicated
  concentrations. Quantification analysis of macropinocytosis-positive cells is shown.
  Data are presented as mean Â± SD.
