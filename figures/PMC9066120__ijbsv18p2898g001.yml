caption: Antitumor effect of MHO7 on TNBC in vitro and in vivo. (A) The chemical structure
  of MHO7. (B) The IC50 value of MHO7 on TNBC cell lines at 12, 24, and 48 h. (C)
  The percentages of apoptosis cells were measured by flow cytometry under MHO7 treatment
  at 24 h. (D) Tumor growth was measured in mice. Data was presented as mean ± SEM.
  (n=6). (E) Final tumor weight was measured in each group. Data was presented as
  mean ± SEM. (n=6). (F) Tumor tissue was analyzed by H&E staining and immunohistochemistry
  analysis of Ki67. Scale bars 50 µm. (n=3). *P <0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P <0.001; and****
  P < 0.0001.
