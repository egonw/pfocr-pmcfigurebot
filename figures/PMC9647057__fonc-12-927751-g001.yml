caption: Correlation between UFM1 expression and GFR pathway and CDK5RAP3 expression.
  (A) Three hundred seventy-five patients in the TCGA cohort were divided into three
  groups (Cluster A, Cluster B and Cluster C) based on unsupervised analysis and hierarchical
  clustering of the ssGSEA scores of the three GFR gene sets. (B) Related proteins
  of the GFR pathway from the TCPA database. (C) Overall survival of patients in Cluster
  A, Cluster B and Cluster (C, D) Venn diagram of the common downregulated genes in
  clusters B vs. A, C vs. A and C vs. B. (E) Venn diagram of the common upregulated
  genes in clusters B vs. A, C vs. A and C vs. B. (F) mRNA levels of CDK5RAP3 in the
  patients in Cluster A, Cluster B and Cluster C. (G) mRNA levels of UMF1 in the patients
  in Cluster A, Cluster B, and Cluster C. (H) Analysis diagram of the protein interaction
  network (GeneMANIA). *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001; ns, no
  significance.
