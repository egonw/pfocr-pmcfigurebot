caption: m6Aâˆ’seq identifies transcripts with altered methylation in psoriasis vulgaris.
  (A) The top 10 Gene Ontology terms were significantly enriched for the hypomethylated
  genes in skin samples derived from patients with psoriasis vulgaris (n = 4) and
  healthy controls (n = 4). (B) Diagram of the Wnt signaling pathway with genes affected
  by m6A. Hypomethylated genes are marked in yellow and nonmethylated genes are marked
  in green. The diagram is based on KEGG annotations. (C) The top 10 significantly
  enriched pathways for the hypomethylated genes in skin samples derived from patients
  with psoriasis vulgaris (n = 4) and healthy controls (n = 4).
