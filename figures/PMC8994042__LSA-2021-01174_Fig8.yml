figure_title: The Golgi egress domain of IFITM3 is conserved across vertebrate members
  of the dispanin/CD225 subfamily A and is functionally conserved in PRRT2, a member
  of the B subfamily as shown by genetic mutations associated with paroxysmal kinesigenic
  dyskinesia
caption: (A) Alignment of the indicated portions of human members of the different
  dispanin/CD225 subfamilies. The relevant domain is circled in red. Bold indicates
  conserved residues. The position of the first amino acid of each sequence is shown
  within parentheses. (B) Single point mutation and confocal microscopy analysis of
  the Golgi egress domain of IFITM1. (C) Point mutations and confocal microscopy analysis
  of PRRT2 mutants in the region corresponding to the Golgi egress domain of IFITM3.
  R295Q and A291V are genetic mutations associated to paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia.
  Representative pictures are shown for each protein. Whiskers and boxes plots of
  the quantification of the proportion of each protein in the Golgi as a Golgi/cytoplasm
  ratio (25–75 percentiles with individual cells represented as dots; group average
  indicated by an asterisk, n = 20 in three independent experiments). Colored boxes
  represent statistical significant differences after a two-tailed t test or a one-way
  ANOVA, Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test (B and C, respectively) of the examined
  mutant over WT. **P-value of 0.0019; ****P-value < 0.0001. Source data are provided
  in the relevant section.
