caption: Cytochrome P450 pathway. ARA 20:4n-6 can be converted in the cytochrome P450
  pathway, resulting in the formation of various ETT and HETE. ETT can undergo further
  transformations where they are incorporated into glycerophospholipids in the sn-2
  position; in this form, they build the cell membrane and intracellular membranes.
  In addition, the epoxide bond in ETT can be transformed by EPHX1 and EPHX2 into
  two hydroxyl groups, resulting in the formation of various DHET. ETT can also undergo
  ω-hydroxylation, which results in the formation of various HEET. ETT can be converted
  with COX. 5,6-EET then produces 5,6-epoxy-PGH2, whereas 8,9-EET produces either
  8,9,11-EHET or 8,9,15-EHET. ↑—higher expression of given enzymes in GBM tumor relative
  to healthy tissue; ↓—lower expression of given enzymes in GBM tumor relative to
  healthy tissue.
