caption: Newly diagnosed glioblastomas (GBMs) exhibit different epidermal growth factor
  receptor (EGFR), suppressor of cytokine signalling 2 (SOCS2) and growth hormone
  receptor (GHR) expression patterns. (A) Top‐most significantly modulated canonical
  pathways between low (n = 27) versus high (n = 27) EGFR‐expressing GBM. The bar
  size represents the –log(p). (B) Signal transducer and activator of transcription
  (STAT) signalling pathway with differential expression status (up/red, down/green)
  in low versus high‐EGFR‐expressing GBMs. (C) EGFR, SOCS2 and GHR expression heatmap
  in GBM samples (n = 54). (D) GHR expression in the ONT GBM cohort measured by RT‐qPCR.
  A break (arrow) can be seen in the overall distribution and was used to define GBMGHR
  high versus GBMGHR low groups. Comparison of expression of GHR RT‐qPCR data in GBMGHR
  high (n = 18) versus GBMGHR low (n = 36). Y‐axis represents 2−Δ CT for each gene
  relative to PPIA expression. ****p ≤ .0001. (E) Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining
  of GHR (top) and p‐STAT5 (bottom) shows high‐GHR protein expression in two GBMGHR
  high cases, whereas no protein expression is detected in a GBMGHR low case. Scale
  bars in insets correspond to 30 μM. Black arrows show positive cells, whereas grey
  arrows show negative cells. Additional regions per cases and negative controls can
  be seen in Figure . GHR IHC images shown are representative of 17 GBM cases (6 GBMGHR
  high, 10 GBMGHR low) analysed. Positive GHR protein expression is found in ≥30%
  of tumour area of GBMGHR high cases. (F) Distribution of GHR mRNA expression (normalized
  gene level RNA‐sequencing expression data in FPKM) in tumour anatomic structures
  defined as part of the Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas project, such as infiltrative tumour
  (IT), leading edge (LE), cellular tumour (CT) and pseudopalisading cells around
  necrosis (PAN). ***p ≤ .001; *p ≤ .05. (G) Proportional distribution of EGFR genomic
  alterations (mutations or amplification) and molecular subtypes in GBMGHR high (n = 60)
  versus GBMGHR low (n = 456) (TCGA dataset, z‐score of 1.3). Results were analysed
  by Pearson's chi‐square test.
