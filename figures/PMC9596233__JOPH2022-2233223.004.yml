caption: 'Changes in PKC activity in RPE cells, as shown by agarose gel electrophoresis.
  The ratio of the gray value of phosphorylated PKC and that of nonphosphorylated
  PKC indicated PKC activity. The data are presented as the mean ± SD (n = 3). An
  LSD test was conducted following one-way ANOVA. ∗P < 0.05 vs. control cells; #P
  < 0.05 vs. blue light-treated cells; &P < 0.05 vs. blue light + chloroquine-treated
  cells; ▲P < 0.05 vs. blue light + A2E-treated cells.'
