caption: Artemisinin biosynthesis pathway and competitive metabolic pathway in A.
  annua. The biosynthesis of artemisinin is derived from the MVA and MEP pathways.
  FPP is the important intermediate at the branch point of artemisinin biosynthesis,
  which can not only be converted into amorpha-4,11-diene and artemisinin, but also
  into other terpenoids through competitive metabolic pathways, such as squalene,
  β-farnesene, β-caryophyllene, germacrene A, etc. The competitive pathways are marked
  with red boxes. HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A; GA-3P, glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate; DXP, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate; MEP, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate;
  HMBPP, 4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl diphosphate; IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate;
  DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; HMGR, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase;
  DXS, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase; DXR, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate
  reductoisomerase; HDR, 4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl diphosphate reductase; IPPI,
  isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase; FPPS, farnesyl diphosphate synthase; ADS, amorpha-4,11-diene
  synthase; CYP71AV1, cytochrome P450 monooxygenase; CPR, cytochrome P450 reductase;
  ALDH1, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1; DBR2, artemisinic aldehyde Δ11(13) reductase; SQS,
  squalene synthase; BFS, β-farnesene synthase; CPS, β-caryophyllene synthase; GAS,
  germacrene A synthase; RED1, dihydroartemisinic aldehyde reductase.
