caption: Transcriptional signature of BMMCs exposed to cyclic hypoxia is related to
  oxidative phosphorylation and the FcεRI signaling pathway. (A) Volcano plot of DEGs
  in BMMCs exposed to cyH. Green dots, downregulated genes; red dots, upregulated
  genes. (B) Functional annotation of upregulated genes in BMMCs subjected to cyH.
  Enrichment of biological processes (BP) and cellular components (CC) along with
  the number of genes associated with each functional category. (C) Enrichment map
  of the top ten enriched upregulated pathways in cyH conditions. The number of DEGs
  associated with each pathway is illustrated according to the size of the circle.
  (D) Two million BMMCs were exposed to N (2.5 h at 21% O2) or cyH (H2) and real-time
  quantitative PCR was performed to validate the overexpression of some DEGs associated
  with the FcεRI signaling pathway. Unpaired t-test, * p < 0.05, and ** p < 0.01 versus
  N, n = 3–5 experiments for each condition using different BMMCs cultures.
