caption: Combination treatment of CTX and PD decreases proliferation and enhance apoptosis
  in vivo. (A) Images of Ki67 immunohistochemical analysis and TUNEL staining assay
  in subcutaneous tumor models. Scale bars, 100 μm. (B) Quantitation of positive immunohistochemical
  staining for Ki67 and TUNEL staining in every group. Graph of percentage of positive
  cells for Ki67 and TUNEL staining (three random fields). ImageJ was used to quantify
  positive immunohistochemical staining results (n=3). Data are shown as the mean
  ± S.D. One-way ANOVA was used to analyze P values between groups. All groups are
  compared with the ‘Control’ group, and the ‘CTX’ group is compared with the ‘CTX+PD’
  group. *P < 0.05 represents a significant difference.
