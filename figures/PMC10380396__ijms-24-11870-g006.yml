caption: SKAP1 modulates the JAK1/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in GC cells. (A) Western
  blot analysis measuring the levels of JAK1, PI3K, AKT, and their phosphorylated
  proteins after SKAP1 knockdown. (B) Western blot analysis detecting the levels of
  JAK1, PI3K, AKT, and their phosphorylated proteins after treatment with the PI3K
  activator 740Y-P (20 Âµg/mL). NC represents cells transfected with a scrambled siRNA,
  while S2 and S3 represent siSKAP1-2- and siSKAP2-3-transfected cells, respectively.
  S2+740Y-P represents siSKAP1-2+PI3K activator-treated cells. All experiments were
  repeated three times.
