caption: (A) Capsaicin caused a dose‐dependent reduction in SIRT1 and SOX2 levels
  as detected with western blotting. WB‐F344 cells were treated with different concentrations
  (0, 100, 200, and 300 μM) of capsaicin for 24 h. β‐actin served as a loading control
  (n = 3). (B) Overexpression of SIRT1 induced by plasmid transfection can compensate
  for the reduction of SOX2 levels caused by capsaicin treatment in WB‐F344 cells.
  (C) Overexpression of SOX2 induced by plasmid transfection cannot compensate for
  the SIRT1 reduction induced by capsaicin treatment in WB‐F344 cells. (D) Immunofluorescent
  staining showed that the expression of SIRT1 and SOX2 was decreased by capsaicin
  treatment. Scale bars, 40 μm
