caption: 'Enriched bar chart of GO names of up-regulated genes as results of pairwise
  DEGs analysis (Fisher’s exact test). Symbols: (a) upregulated GOs of high-dosage
  treated plants vs. control; (b) upregulated GOs of low-dosage treated plants vs.
  control. Red: treated samples; Blue: control samples. According to these results,
  contigs of response to stress, response to biotic stimuli, and response to stimulus
  GO names were further analyzed.'
