caption: 'Schematics of the study design and outcome summarizing the main steps and
  outcomes of pharmacologically- and genetically induced RAS-MAPK pathway modulation
  assessed in Teen ERK reporter embryos. (A) Positive and negative modulation of RAS-MAPK
  signaling (via monitoring ERK activation) are obtained through pharmacological approach
  by acute stimulation with Epidermal growth factor, EGF, or prolonged exposure to
  the SPH2 inhibitor SHP099, respectively. ERK activation is assessed using the FRET-based
  ERK sensor Teen. In this study, an increase in the FRET signal in Teen embryos (due
  to elevated ERK activity) is visible in ventral forebrain upon EGF injection (upper
  panel). A decrease in FRET signal (due to reduced ERK activity) is visible in different
  brain domains and tail upon treatment with SHP099 (lower panel). (B, C) Genetic
  modulation of RAS-MAPK signaling in early embryos of a well-established Shp2D61G-NS
  zebrafish model (B) and partial rescue obtained by with low- (0.25 µM) and high-dose
  (1 µM) MEK inhibitor PD0325901 (PD) (C) are assessed by FRET in Teen embryos and
  precede onset of classical RASopathy morphological hallmarks (embryo axis and body
  length, validated at 11 hpf and 55 hpf, respectively). pERK: phosphorylated ERK'
