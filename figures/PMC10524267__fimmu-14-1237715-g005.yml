caption: CX3CR1 mAb can reduce the secretion of immunosuppressive soluble mediators
  in the CT26 tumor. Heatmap of mRNA expression of CT26 tumor cell line treated with
  (A) CX3CL1 (2 µg/ml) or no treatment (B) IFN-γ (100 ng/ml) or IFN-γ + CX3CL1, for
  8 hours (n=3). (C) Pathway enrichment analysis from (A) using Reactome database.
  (D) Quantification of G-CSF, LIF, IL-6, CXCL2 and CCL5 secreted from CT26 with CX3CL1
  (2 µg/ml) for 24 hour or no treatment. Data combined from two independent experiments.
  Data as standard error of the mean, paired t-test. *p<0.05. (E) Quantification of
  CXCL1 and MCSF secreted from CT26 tumor cell line treated with no treatment, CX3CL1
  (2 µg/ml), CX3CR1 mAb (10 µg/ml), CX3CL1 (2 µg/ml) + CX3CR1 mAb (10 µg/ml) after
  24 hours. Data representative of two independent experiments. (F) IL-6 and NLRP3
  mRNA from CT26 tumor cell line treated with no treatment, CX3CL1 (2 µg/ml), CX3CR1
  mAb (10 µg/ml), CX3CL1 (2 µg/ml) + CX3CR1 mAb (10 µg/ml) after 8 hours. RNA quantified
  using RT-qPCR. Data combined from two-three independent experiments. Data as one
  way ANOVA with Tukey’s test. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001.
article_title: The CX3CL1-CX3CR1 chemokine axis can contribute to tumor immune evasion
  and blockade with a novel CX3CR1 monoclonal antibody enhances response to anti-PD-1
  immunotherapy.
