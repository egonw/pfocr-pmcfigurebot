figure_title: Injury-specific chromatin opening dictates gene activation
caption: a Heatmap visualization of ATAC-seq signals in Sham, MI, and SI TECs centered
  on peak summits ± 2 Kb. Peaks are ordered vertically by ATAC-seq signal strength.
  The signal strength are denoted by color intensities. b Volcano plots showing differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) (MI versus SI). c Scatterplots of the DEGs and DARs-associated
  genes. Red indicates genes that are more accessible and upregulated in SI, and blue
  indicates genes that are more accessible and upregulated in MI. For Day 2, P = 3.08 × 10−3;
  for Day 7, P < 2.20 × 10−16. d Visualization of H3K27ac ChIP-seq signals in Sham,
  MI, and SI TECs centered on peak summits ± 3 Kb. e Scatterplot of the fold change
  (MI versus SI) of ATAC-seq signals in TECs at day 2 and day 7. P < 2.20 × 10−16.
  f Scatterplot of day 2 DARs-associated genes and day 7 DEGs. P = 7.63 × 10−15. g
  Pathway analysis of DEGs within day 2 DARs and day 7 DARs in mild or severe injury.
  Venn diagram shows overlap of MI- and SI-DARs-associated genes identified in c and
  f. h Genome browser view showing DARs at the indicated gene loci for TECs. Red represents
  increase, and blue represents decrease (b, c, f). Statistical significance was analyzed
  by cor.test (c, e, f) or Metascape (https://metascape.org/gp/index.html) (g). Source
  data are provided as a Source Data file.
