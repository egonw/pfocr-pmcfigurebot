caption: 'CUR increases the cell viability in HG. (A) The chemical structure of CUR.
  (B) The cell viability was measured for cells treated with glucose in different
  concentrations (5.5-100 mmol/l) and for cells treated with curcumin in different
  concentrations (5-40 µM) under HG conditions. Each error bar is the standard deviation
  of the mean (n=6). Significance level between two test conditions: *P<0.05. Con,
  control group treated with 5.5 mmol/l glucose; HG, high glucose group treated with
  33 mmol/l glucose; CUR, curcumin.'
article_title: Curcumin activates autophagy and attenuates high glucose-induced apoptosis
  in HUVECs through the ROS/NF-κB signaling pathway.
