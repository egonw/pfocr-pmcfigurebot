caption: The effect of TMZ on DNA damage and repair regulating factors and key molecules
  of the PI3K signaling pathway in GBM cells. (a) SF295, U87, and U251 cells were
  treated with different concentrations of TMZ (10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640, and
  1280 μM) for 72 h. Cell viability was determined by WST-8 assay. (b)–(f) SF295 and
  U87 cells were treated with TMZ (120 μM and 180 μM) for 48 and 72 h. (b) The cells
  were then collected for western blotting detection of the DNA SSB marker XRCC1 and
  the DSB marker γ-H2AX. (c) The cells were harvested for qRT-PCR analysis of BRCA1
  and RAD51. (d) Western blot analysis of DNA damage repair proteins, including p-ATM,
  BRCA1, RAD51, DNA-PKcs, and Ku80. (e) qRT-PCR analysis of PIK3CA and PIK3CB. (f)
  Western blot analysis of key proteins in the PI3K signaling pathway, including PI3K-p110α,
  PI3K-p110β, p-Akt, Akt, p-mTOR, and mTOR. For western blotting, β-actin was used
  as a loading control. For qRT-PCR, gene expression was normalized to 18 s rRNA.
  All data are presented as the mean ± SD (n = 3). ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01; ∗∗∗P < 0.001;
  ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001.
