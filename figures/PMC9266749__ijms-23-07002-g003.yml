caption: 'Human IL12p80 stimulated differentiation of mouse NSCs to oligodendrocyte
  lineages through phosphorylation of Stat3 in vitro. (A) The morphology of the differentiated
  cells from mouse NSCs to oligodendrocytes is due to the addition of T3/CNTF or hIL12p80.
  (B) Quantitative results and a representative profile of immunoblotting with oligodendrocyte
  markers: (a) SOX10, (b) Olig1 and a neural stem cell marker: (c) SOX2. The Western
  blot results are shown in Figure (d). (C) Quantitative results and a representative
  profile of immunoblotting with the Stat3-Y705 and S727 phosphorylation. (D) The
  illustration of the potential signaling pathway of mouse NSCs differentiated into
  oligodendrocyte lineages through the hIL12p80-induced phosphorylation of Stat3.
  Statistical differences compared to the control group are indicated by * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001.'
