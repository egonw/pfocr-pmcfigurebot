caption: Regulation of MTAP-related metabolic pathways by MTAP in BC cells. Schematic
  diagram depicting two MTAP-related metabolic pathways (Methionine salvage pathway
  and Polyamine pathway). Each histogram next to the metabolite represents its relative
  levels detected in MTAP overexpressed MDA-MB-231 clones (MDA-MB-231-MTAP) as compared
  to their controls (MDA-MB-231-EV). MTA, 5'-Deoxy-5'-Methylthioadenosine; MTAP, methylthioadenosine
  phosphorylase; MTR-1P, 5-Methylthioribose-1-phosphate; MTOB, 4-methylthio-2-oxobutanoic
  acid; SAM, S-Adenosylmethionine; dcSAM, S-Adenosylmethioninamine; ODC, Ornithine
  Decarboxylase. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001, Student's t-test. FC, Fold
  change was calculated by the average value of metabolite detected in MDA-MB-231-MTAP
  relative to their controls. FC > 1.0 indicates an increased level of metabolites
  while FC < 1.0 indicates a decreased level of metabolites in MDA-MB-231-MTAP vs
  MDA-MB-231-EV cells. Data are presented as mean Â± SD of six independent experiments.
