caption: 'HMGB1 increases the phosphorylation level of the NF-κB subunit-P65 in TMJOA
  synovial fibroblasts. Western blotting analysis of phospho-p65, p65 in synovial
  fibroblasts cultured with different doses of HMGB1 for 24 h (A), or 100 ng/mL HMGB1
  for various times (B); β-actin served as control; data are shown as the means with
  95% CI and analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test, n=6, *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001.
  C) Immunofluorescence staining of phospho-p65 (red) in synovial fibroblasts treated
  with HMGB1. Scale bar: 30 μm.'
article_title: Inhibition of HMGB1 suppresses inflammation and catabolism in temporomandibular
  joint osteoarthritis via NF-κB signaling pathway.
