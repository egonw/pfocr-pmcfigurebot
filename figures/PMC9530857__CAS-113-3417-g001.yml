caption: JNK pathway is crucial for expansion and stemness of human colorectal cancer
  cells in the context of BRG1 suppression. (A) Western blot analysis for p‐c‐JUN
  expression in DLD‐1 and HCT 116 cells treated with DMSO or SP600125 at 10 nM for
  24 h and at 20 nM for 2 h. (B) MTS assay of DLD‐1 and HCT 116 cells treated with
  DMSO or SP600125 at 10 nM for 24 h and at 20 nM for 2 h (n = 3, 4). Means ± SEM
  are shown. (C) Quantitative real‐time (qRT)‐PCR analysis of DLD‐1 and HCT 116 cells
  2 days after treatment with DMSO or SP600125 at 10 nM for 24 h (n = 4). Means ±
  SEM are shown. (D) Images of DLD‐1 and HCT 116 cells treated with siBRG1 + DMSO
  or siBRG1 + SP600125 on day 3 after siRNA treatment. Scale bars = 100 μm. (E) Ratio
  of MTS assay on day 3 / day 0 of DLD‐1 and HCT 116 cells silenced with DMSO, siBRG1 + DMSO,
  and siBRG1 + SP600125 at 10 nM for 24 h (DLD‐1, p = 0.007; HCT 116, p = 0.002; n = 5).
  (F) qRT‐PCR analysis of DLD‐1 and HCT 116 cells silenced with DMSO, siBRG1 + DMSO,
  and siBRG1 + SP600125 at 10 nM for 24 h on day 2 after siRNA treatment (n = 5).
