caption: Pathway analysis of proteins showing significant alterations. (A) Pathway
  analysis of significantly differentially expressed proteins by IPA. The top 10 canonical
  pathways of the altered proteins were calculated by a right‚Äêtailed Fisher's exact
  test. The red and blue colors represent significant activation and inhibition pathways,
  respectively. (B) The activated UPR pathway network in endoplasmic reticulum. This
  network showed that PDI, BIP, and CALR were upregulated and induced endoplasmic
  reticulum stress. (C) The XBP1 regulatory network was predicted by experimental
  evidence derived from the IPA database. (D) The protein level of XBP1 in keloid
  scars and normal skin tissues was determined by WB. IPA, ingenuity pathway analysis;
  KS, keloid scar; NS, normal skin; UPR, unfolded protein response; WB, western blot
