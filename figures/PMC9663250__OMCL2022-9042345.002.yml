caption: 'DPCs promoted the HFSC proliferation in cell cocultured system. (a) Indirect
  immunofluorescence staining of HFSCs. After coculturing with DPCs (passage 3) for
  48 h, HFSCs (passage 3) were incubated with antibodies against PCNA (scale bar:
  50 μm). The upper chamber of the control group did not contain any cells. (b) The
  cocultured with DPCs (passage 3) increased the expression of HFSCs (passage 3).'
