caption: IL-17D promotes infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). (A)
  Representative flow cytometry profiles and percentages of TAMs in CD45+ TILs in
  subcutaneous tumors (n = 3). Mean ± SD. **P < 0.01. (B) Representative flow cytometry
  profiles and percentages of CD206+ cells in CD11b+ F4/80+ cell populations in subcutaneous
  tumors (n = 2). Mean ± SD. *P < 0.05. (C and D) Flow cytometric analysis and quantification
  of M-MDSCs (C) and G-MDSCs (D) in CD45+ TILs in subcutaneous tumors (n = 3). Mean
  ± SD. (E, F) Flow cytometric analysis and quantification of CD8+ T cells (E) and
  CD4+ T cells (F) in CD45+ TILs in subcutaneous tumors (n = 3). Mean ± SD. *P < 0.05.
  **P < 0.01. (G) Flow cytometric analysis and quantification of NK cells in CD45+
  TILs in subcutaneous tumors (n = 3). Mean ± SD. (H) Images of subcutaneous tumors.
  (I) Subcutaneous tumor size was measured and compared. **P < 0.01. (J) Representative
  flow cytometry profiles and percentages of TAMs in CD45+ TILs in subcutaneous tumors
  (n = 2). Mean ± SD. *P < 0.05.
