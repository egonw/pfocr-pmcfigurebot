figure_title: PPP activity is impaired in the pgl mutant
caption: A. JE2, pgl and the complemented pgl mutant were grown in CDM [1,2-13C]Glucose
  and fluxes via glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) were compared
  as described previously (). The M+2 pyruvate is unique to glycolysis and the M+1
  pyruvate to PPP. Thus, the M+2/M+1 ratio is indicative of carbon flux through glycolysis
  relative to PPP. The M+0 pyruvate can arise from different sources including the
  unlabeled part of the [1,2-13C]Glucose and pyruvogenic amino acids that are consumed
  alongside glucose. B. Relative levels of M+1 pyruvate indicative of PPP activity
  and M+2 pyruvate indicative of glycolytic activity in JE2, pgl and pglcomp. C. The
  M+2/M+1 ratio indicative of pyruvate produced directly from glucose flux through
  glycolysis in JE2, pgl and pglcomp. Data are the average of three independent experiments
  and standard deviations are shown. Significant differences were determined using
  ordinary one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison using GraphPad Prism V9
  and adjusted p-value **** p<0.0001 is indicated.
