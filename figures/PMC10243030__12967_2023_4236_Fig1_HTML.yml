caption: 'NUCB2/Nesfatin-1 is overexpressed in breast cancer and correlates with poor
  prognosis. A NUCB2 mRNA expression in primary breast cancer tissues (n = 1097) and
  normal tissues (n = 114) as analyzed by TCGA data. B Kaplan–Meier survival curve
  based on univariate NUCB2 level using TCGA data. C ELISA results of Nesfatin-1 concentration
  in serum samples of healthy donors (n = 40) and breast cancer patients (n = 40).
  Each dot represents the mean Nesfatin-1 concentration in triplicates of each sample.
  D RT-qPCR analysis of NUCB2 mRNA expression in immortalized mammary epithelial-like
  cell line and four breast cancer cell lines. E ELISA results of Nesfatin-1 concentration
  in supernatants from immortalized mammary epithelial-like cell line and four breast
  cancer cell lines. 2 × 105 breast cancer cells were seeded in a six-well plate containing
  2 mL medium and cultured overnight. The supernatants were collected and Nesfatin-1
  concentration was detected by ELISA. F Representative Western blots and relative
  quantitative data of NUCB2 expression in BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with
  P300/CREBBP inhibitor C646. Representative results from at least three independent
  experiments are shown. Statistical significance was determined using unpaired T-test.
