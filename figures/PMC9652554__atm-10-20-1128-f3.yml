caption: 'The silencing of SAAL1 suppressed NLR signaling. (A) A GSEA analysis was
  conducted to determine the enriched pathway of the differently expressed genes upon
  SAAL1. (B) The protein levels of NLRP3, NOD1, and MAPK1 in the lung tissues were
  examined by western blotting. **, P<0.01 vs. control group; ##, P<0.01 vs. shNC
  + LPS group. SAAL1, serum amyloid A-like 1; GSEA, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis;
  GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; shNC,
  short hairpin RNA negative control.'
