caption: (a) SALARECON predictions of relative growth rate under oxygen limitation
  as a function of relative oxygen uptake rate. Feed composition and flux capacities
  were randomized 1,000 times (light blue) and the mean across conditions is shown
  with 95% confidence band from bootstrapping with 1,000 samples (dark blue). (b)
  Metabolic, logistic, and extended Monod model fits to experimental data from Berg
  and Danielsberg [] (circles), Bergheim et al. [] (triangles), Hosfeld et al. []
  (squares), and Hosfeld et al. [] (diamonds). SALARECON predictions were fit by assuming
  a linear relationship between relative oxygen uptake rate and water oxygen saturation.
  (c) Coefficient of determination (R2), minimal oxygen saturation required for growth
  (x0), and minimal oxygen saturation required for maximal growth (x1) from fitted
  models. Error bars indicate two standard errors of the estimates. (d) Minimal flux
  distributions for metabolic model predictions from parsimonious flux balance analysis
  (pFBA) []. Rows are reactions, columns are flux distributions sorted by relative
  oxygen uptake rate, and each cell shows absolute flux normalized by maximum value
  for each condition. Rows are clustered by Euclidean distance using Wardâ€™s minimum
  variance method and divided into eight clusters indicated by colors. (e) Mean absolute
  relative flux with 95% confidence bands from bootstrapping with 1,000 samples for
  the eight clusters. Relative growth rate is indicated by a dashed line. (f) Enrichment
  of metabolic pathways from KEGG [] for the eight clusters with size reflecting the
  fraction of genes in each pathway that are found in a cluster (recall).
