caption: MEK1 Q56P melanoma model is sensitive to combination BRAF/MEK inhibitor treatment
  in both 2D and 3D tissue culture. (A) Dose-response curves for A375 WT cells in
  2D tissue culture with dabrafenib (grey line), trametinib (black line), or a combination
  of dabrafenib and trametinib (red line, molarity indicates total drug concentration);
  (B) Dose-response curves for NRAS Q61K cells in 2D tissue culture with dabrafenib,
  trametinib, or a combination of dabrafenib and trametinib; (C) Dose-response curves
  for MEK1 Q56P cells in 2D tissue culture with dabrafenib, trametinib, or combination;
  (D) Dose-response curves for MEK1 Q56P cells in 2D tissue culture with dabrafenib,
  trametinib, or combination. Lower survival with combination indicates synergistic
  drug killing in this line; (E) Immunoblot demonstrating synergistic inhibition of
  the MEK/ERK signaling pathway in MEK1 Q56P melanoma model cells in 2D tissue culture.
  Cells were treated with either 1.0 μM of the indicated inhibitor compound or with
  0.5 μM each of each indicated drug for 90 min prior to harvesting protein (Db =
  dabrafenib 1.0 μM, Vb = vemurafenib 1.0 μM, Tb = trametinib 1.0 μM, Bb = binimetinib
  1.0 μM, Db/Tb = dabrafenib 0.5 μM + trametinib 0.5 μM); (F) Model of synergistic
  inhibition of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway by combination MEK and BRAF inhibitor
  treatment. Orange star indicates the primary BRAF V600E mutation which drives cell
  proliferation in the absence of BRAF inhibitor. Treatment with BRAF inhibitor results
  in secondary MEK1 Q65P mutation (black outlined orange star). In the presence of
  these two mutations, upstream pathway inhibition with BRAF inhibitor in combination
  with downstream pathway inhibition with MEK inhibitor (red arrows) leads to less
  cell survival and proliferation than is observed when each drug is used alone; (G)
  Susceptibility of MEK1 Q56P cells grown in 3D tissue culture to dabrafenib, trametinib,
  and combination drug treatment. For each indicated cell type, 500 cells were seeded
  in each well of a ULA spheroid microplate and grown for three days in the absence
  of drug. The spheroids were then treated with 12 nM dabrafenib, 4 nM trametinib,
  a combination of 6 nM dabrafenib and 2 nM trametinib, or vehicle control for an
  additional three days. Spheroids were then stained with 2 μM Calcein AM green and
  NucBlue live-cell nuclear marker for 90 min and then imaged; (H) Spheroid sizes
  were calculated relative to the un-drugged condition. Results from at least n =
  3 spheroids for each condition were averaged and plotted, statistical analysis was
  performed using two-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons. ***, p < 0.001.
