caption: Effects of D-carvone on the expression of TGF-β and MMP9 transcription levels
  in liver tissues CCl4-intoxicated rats. The transcription levels of TGF-β (A) and
  MMP9 (B) genes in the hepatic tissues. The relative mRNA expression is represented
  as fold change over the normal control value after normalization to β-actin using
  the 2−ΔΔCT calculation method. Values are expressed as mean ± SD (n = 5). Data were
  analyzed by one way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test, ap ≤ 0.05 compared with NC and
  bp ≤ 0.05 compared with CCl4 group. NC, normal control; CCl4, carbon tetrachloride;
  TGF-β1, transforming growth factor-β1; MMP9; matrix metalloprotease 9.
