figure_title: A network-based approach predicts common pathway disruptions in neurodegenerative
  diseases
caption: a Schematic representation of network propagation by mapping GWAS hits onto
  protein-protein interactions (left), leading to network modules (right). b Method
  benchmarking using gene-to-disease associations extracted from the DISEASE database
  and drug targets from ChEMBL datasets. Barplots represent the areas under the receiver
  operator characteristic (ROC) curves (AUCs) for three conditions, ALS, Parkinson’s
  and Alzheimer’s diseases. c Heatmap represents gene overlaps between various neurodegenerative
  disease modules, based on the Jaccard similarity index. Barplots illustrate the
  gene counts from the initial GWAS input (red) and from the expanded significant
  modules used for Jaccard index calculations (yellow). d Heatmap showing overlaps
  between the 10 gene-network modules, shared amongst at least two neurodegenerative
  diseases (Jaccard index >0.7, yellow colour), and described using Gene Ontology
  Biological Process (GOBP) annotation (right sided list). Please, also see Suppl.
