figure_title: H. pylori causes DNA-damage and a DNA-damage response through the mitochondrial
  apoptosis pathway
caption: 'a AGS cell lines were infected with H. pylori G27 strain at an MOI of 100
  for 18 h. The DNA-damage response was measured as γH2AX-signal by immunofluorescence.
  Nuclei were counted positive for γH2AX if they had more than 4 dots. Shown are representative
  pictures and the quantification of five independent experiments with at least 250
  cells per condition. The etoposide (10 µM, 18 h) positive control was done three
  times. Scale bars indicate 50 µM. b AGS cell lines were infected with H. pylori
  G27 strain at an MOI of 25 for 72 h. Micronuclei were detected by fluorescence microscopy
  after DNA staining with DAPI and cell staining with β-Tubulin. Shown are the values
  of the individual pictures of three independent experiments with at least 600 cells
  per condition. Significance was calculated with the mean value of each individual
  experiment. c KATOIII cell lines were infected with H. pylori G27 strain at an MOI
  of 10 for 5 h. The DNA-damage response was measured as γH2AX-signal by Western blot.
  Shown are representative Western blots and quantification of four independent experiments.
  d, e HeLa cell lines were infected with H. pylori G27 strain at an MOI of 100 for
  18 h. The DNA-damage response was measured as γH2AX-signal by Western blot. Shown
  are representative Western blots and quantification of four (d) and at least two
  (e) independent experiments. Not normalized data are shown in S8K. f HeLa cell lines
  deficient in caspase-9 (Cas.9−/−), caspase-3 (Cas.3−/−) or caspase-7 (Cas.7−/−)
  were infected with H. pylori G27 strain at an MOI of 100 for 24 h. The DNA-damage
  response was measured as γH2AX-signal by Western blot. Shown are representative
  Western blots of three (Cas.9−/−, Cas.7−/−) or two (Cas.3−/−) independent experiments.
  Data information: Bars represent the mean and dots the value of independent experiments
  (a, c, d, e) or of micronuclei per picture (b). Error bars show standard error of
  mean. Ns: p > 0.05, *, p < 0.05, **, p < 0.01. Significance was tested by parametric
  one-way ANOVA (Sidak´s post hoc testing). CTRL non-targeting control gRNA; Bax−/−Bak−/−,
  double deletion of Bax and Bak, by CRISPR/Cas9; Bcl-XL, overexpressing Bcl-XL; CAD−/−,
  deletion of CAD by CRISPR/Cas9; Cas.9−/−, deletion of caspase-9 by CRISPR/Cas9;
  Cas.3−/−, deletion of caspase-3 by CRISPR/Cas9; Cas.7−/−, deletion of caspase-7
  by CRISPR/Cas9. Z-VAD, the pan-caspase-inhibitor z-VAD-fmk.'
