caption: Pathway enrichment for the genes whose promoters are regulated by DNA methylation
  in the pancreas. The gene enrichment pathways for T1D, T2D, and GDM were generated
  using the web tool Enrichr, and the associated pathways were plotted using ggplot2
  and R‚Äêpackage. The picture show how Insulin and the associated signalling pathways
  are altered in T1D, T2D, and GDM in relation to the pancreas (p value <0.05). GDM,
