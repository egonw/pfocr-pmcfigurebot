caption: 'Tapinarof inhibits autoimmune aggravation in MRL/lpr mice. (A) Schematic
  diagram showing the experimental design of the present study. (B) The spleens of
  tapinarof‐treated and untreated mice were removed, and the weights were measured
  (n = 7–9). (C) Cervical lymph nodes were isolated from the mice (n = 7–9). (D) Representative
  H&E‐ and PAS‐ stained images from mouse kidney sections were collected at the end
  of the observation period. Scale bars: 50 μm (left). The numbers of abnormal glomeruli
  were recorded (right) (n = 7–8). (E) The plasma urea nitrogen levels were measured
  (n = 4–5). (F) IgG and IgM depositions in the kidney sections were assessed using
  immunofluorescence staining (left). The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was analyzed
  with ImageJ (right) (n = 5). (G) Antibody titers of immunoglobulin classes were
  detected using the LEGENDplex kit (n = 5–10). The data were obtained from two independent
  experiments. Error bars indicate SD. Each symbol in the graphs represents a separate
  mouse; Tapi (L), low concentration (1 mg/kg) of tapinarof; Tapi (H), high concentration
  (5 mg/kg) of tapinarof; *p < .05, **p < .01, and ***p < .001.'
