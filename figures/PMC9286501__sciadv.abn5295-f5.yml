figure_title: ZMYND8 induces 27-HC accumulation in BCSCs
caption: (A) Heatmap of dysregulated genes identified with RNA-seq in MDA-MB-231-SC,
  ZMYND8 KO, and ZMYND8 rescue (RES) cells (monolayers) and their mammospheres (spheres).
  n = 2 biological replicates. (B and C) Gene ontology (B) and hallmark pathway enrichment
  (C) analyses of 87 ZMYND8–up-regulated genes. (D) RT-qPCR analysis of mRNA expression
  of cholesterol metabolic genes in MDA-MB-231-SC, ZMYND8 KO, and ZMYND8 rescue cells
  and their mammospheres. n = 3 biological replicates. (E) Correlation analysis between
  ZMYND8 mRNA expression and cholesterol biosynthesis/metabolism gene signatures in
  human breast tumors from TCGA cohort. (F) Immunoblot analysis of proteins involved
  in cholesterol/27-HC metabolism in MDA-MB-231-SC, ZMYND8 KO, and ZMYND8 rescue cells
  and their mammospheres. n = 3 biological replicates. P, precursor form. M, mature
  form. (G) Enrichment of ZMYND8 and H3K14ac (highlighted in badshahi brown) on 27-HC
  metabolic genes in MDA-MB-231 monolayers. (H) Enrichment of ZMYND8 on 27-HC metabolic
  genes in parental and ZMYND8 KO MDA-MB-231 mammospheres. (I) Mass spectrometry analysis
  of sterols and oxysterols in MDA-MB-231-SC, ZMYND8 KO, and ZMYND8 rescue cells and
  their mammospheres (mean, n = 4). (J to M) Mass spectrometry analysis of 27-HC in
  control (MMTV-PyMT/+ and Zmynd8+/+) and Zmynd8MMTV-cKO (MMTV-PyMT/+, MMTV-Cre/+,
  and Zmynd8fl/fl) tumorspheres (J; means ± SEM, n = 3 biological replicates), PyMT
  tumors (K; means ± SEM, n = 4), tumor interstitial fluid (L; means ± SEM, n = 3),
  and serum (M; means ± SEM, n = 4 biological replicates). P value was determined
  by two-tailed Student’s t test.
