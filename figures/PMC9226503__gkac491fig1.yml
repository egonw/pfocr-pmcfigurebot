caption: Targeting of p100/p52 promotes a transcriptional downregulation of RAD51
  and other proteins known to control DSB repair by HR. RNA-seq was performed on U2OS
  cells transfected with non-silencing (NS), NFKB2 or RELB siRNA. (A) Knockdown is
  efficient for both p100/52 and RelB, based on mRNA measurements by RNA-seq (left)
  and protein level by western blot (right). (B) KEGG pathway analysis of was performed
  to predict the 10 most upregulated and 10 most downregulated pathways in response
  to siNFKB2. Corresponding effects in response to siRELB are also displayed. (C)
  Expression levels are displayed for 39 genes with known relevance to HR, as defined
  by the KEGG database. Genes are arrayed from left to right based on degree of expression
  change after siNFKB2 (* denotes P < 0.01).
