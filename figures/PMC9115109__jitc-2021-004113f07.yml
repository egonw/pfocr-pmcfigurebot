caption: SNORA38B positively regulated GAB2/AKT pathway and facilitated NSCLC cells
  proliferation, migration, and invasion. (A.) Binding activity between GAB2 promoters
  and E2F1 was shown using ChIP assay in A549 cells. Beads and anti-IgG were utilized
  as controls. (B.) Western blotting assay of E2F1 and GAB2 in A549 cells transfected
  with E2F1 KO/OE. Actin was used as loading control. (C). Western blotting assay
  of GAB2, AKT and p-AKT (S473 and T308) in A549 cells transfected with GAB2 KO/OE.
  Actin was used as loading control. (D.) Western blotting assay of E2F1, GAB2, AKT
  and p-AKT (S473 and T308) in A549 cells transfected with SNORA38B KO/OE. Actin was
  used as loading control. (E–F.) Immunofluorescence analysis of GAB2 and p-mTOR in
  A549 cells transfected with SNORA38B KO and SNORA38B KO +SNORA38B OE. (G). Proliferation
  assay of A549 cells transfected with Scr KO, SNORA38B KO, GAB2 OE and SNORA38B KO
  +GAB2 OE. EdU staining assay was used and the positive cells were quantified. (H–I.)
  Migration and invasion of A549 cells transfected with Scr KO, SNORA38B KO, GAB2
  OE and SNORA38B KO +GAB2 OE. Transwell migration and invasion assay were performed.
  The migrated and invaded cells were quantified. (J.) Cell apoptotic analysis of
  A549 cells transfected with Scr KO, SNORA38B KO, GAB2 OE and SNORA38B KO +GAB2 OE.
  Annexin V-FITC/PI staining was performed, apoptostic cells were quantified. Assays
  were conducted in triple. **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001, means±SD was shown.
  Statistical analysis was subjected to Student’s t-test and one-way analysis of variance
  (comparison between-group using LSD method). AKT, protein kinase B; ChIP, chromatin
  immunoprecipitation; CTL, Scr-KO + Blank vector; EdU, 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine;
  E2F, E2F transcription factor; GAB2, GRB2-associated-binding protein 2; KO, knockout;
  LSD, the Fisher's least significant difference; NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer;
  OE, overexpress; p-mTOR, phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin; Scr,
  Scramble; SNORA, small nucleolar RNA.

  blockade in non-small cell lung cancer by remodeling the tumor microenvironment
  via regulation of GAB2/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
