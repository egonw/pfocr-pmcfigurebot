caption: PDLIM1 expression is lowered in GC tissues and cell lines. (a) The database
  (https://www.proteinatlas.org/) was introduced to examine the positive profile of
  PDLIM1 in GC tissues. (b, c) RT-PCR and western blot evaluated the profile of PDLIM1
  in GC tissues and normal paracancer tissues. (d) The coexpressed genes of PDLIM1
  in GC (LindOmics). The heat maps exhibited the positively and negatively coexpressed
  Top-50 genes of PDLIM1 in GC. (e) The staging of tumors. ∗∗∗P < 0.001 (vs. the Normal
  group). N = 45.
