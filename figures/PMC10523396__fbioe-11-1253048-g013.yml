caption: Systemic delivery and biodistribution (A) Administration of nanomedicine,
  NDDSs reach the target position mainly through blood circulation. And the major
  organs responsible for nanoparticle excretion are the kidneys and the liver. (B)
  NP–protein interactions. The term “protein corona” (PC) is used to describe the
  layer that proteins form around NPs when placed in a biofluid. Proteins on the NP
  are always in the dynamic process of adsorption and desorption. With the prolongation
  of exposure time, the low affinity and high concentration of proteins close to the
  NP would be replaced by proteins with high affinity and low concentration, which
  rearrange at the surface of the particle and eventually form an irreversible stably
  hard corona composed of tightly bound proteins, while the replaced proteins absorbed
  on the outside form a reversible unsteadily soft corona consisting of loosely bound
  proteins [172]. (C) Blood circulation The process of NPs‘ distribution from the
  blood circulation to a specific organ/tissue/cell. Vascular extravasation into the
  TME which can be influenced by the perivascular TME, aberrant tumour vasculature.
  (D) Cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking-Scenarios of Carrier-Mediated
  Endosomal Escape and Subcellular Delivery of Cargos. Schematic of endocytosis and
  endosomal escape. Particles entered the cells via the endocytic pathway become entrapped
  in the visieles, the vesicles matured form early endosomes and late endosomes and
  eventually end up in the lysosome, the particles are effective by achieving the
  endosome escape. Alternatively, it is degraded by enzymes in the lysosome.
