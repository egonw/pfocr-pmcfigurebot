figure_title: Concomitant activation of IGF-IR/PI3K/AKT signaling and YAP1 in MLS
  tumor specimens and in vitro models
caption: A IHC stainings show strong expression of IGF-IR, IGF-II, and nuclear YAP1
  in a representative MLS tissue specimen (original magnification, ×10; inset ×20).
  Venn diagram representing the overall concordance of IHC positivity (%). Bar chart
  summarizing overall IHC positivity of IGF-IR, IGF-II, and YAP1 of the MLS cohort
  (n = 54). B Immunoblots of SCP-1 mesenchymal stem cells transduced with FUS-DDIT3
  or EV. C Effects of FUS-DDIT3 depletion on the IGF-IR/PI3K/AKT and Hippo/YAP1 pathways
  in MLS 1765-92 cells. D Subcellular fractionation of MLS 1765-92 cell lysates showing
  increased cytoplasmic p-YAP1 (Ser127) and diminished total YAP1 levels in the nuclear
  fraction upon RNAi-mediated silencing of FUS-DDIT3 for 72 h. GAPDH, cytoplasmic
  marker; Histone H3, nuclear marker. N nucleus, C cytoplasm. E Incubation of serum-starved
  MLS 1765-92 with recombinant IGF-II reverses the effects of FUS-DDIT3 depletion
  on p-LATS1 (Thr1079) and p-YAP1 (Ser127; Ser397). Representative immunoblots from
  at least three independent experiments are shown.
