caption: 'EDA attenuated PM-induced inflammation in HBECs. (a) HBECs were treated
  with EDA in a dose-dependent manner (300, 400, or 500 μM) and then stimulated with
  300 μg/mL PM for 24 h. The mRNA expression of IL-6, IL-1α, and IL-1β was detected
  by RT-PCR. (b) The mRNA of COX-2 was detected by RT-PCR. (c) Western blot showed
  the expression of COX-2 in HBECs upon PM exposure after EDA treatment. The optical
  densities of COX-2 are shown in (d). Values are the mean ± SEM; ∗∗P < 0.01, compared
  with the control group; #P < 0.05 or ##P < 0.01, compared with the PM group; n =
  3. EDA: edaravone; PM: particulate matter; HBECs: human bronchial epithelial cells.'
