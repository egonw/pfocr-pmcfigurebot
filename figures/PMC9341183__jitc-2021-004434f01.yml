caption: FDA-approved ICI agents for NMSCs. Whenever possible, patients should be
  offered participation in clinical trials. Algorithm is intended to provide guidance
  and should not supplant sound clinical judgment—recommendations should be applied
  if feasible and as appropriate for individual patients. See product package inserts
  and the Approved anti-PD-(L)1 agents for MCC, Approved anti-PD-1 agents for CSCC,
  and Approved immunotherapy agents for BCC sections for more information on specific
  indications. *Some patients with advanced NMSC will be eligible for tissue-agnostic
  indications based on TMB and MSI/dMMR status. See the Tissue-agnostic indications
  for ICIs section for more information. †Advanced disease is defined in this guideline
  as tumors that are locally advanced, recurrent, and/or metastatic and not amenable
  to curative surgery or radiotherapy (). ‡Or for whom an HHI is not appropriate.
  §Accelerated approvals contingent on confirmatory trials at the time of guideline
  publication. BCC, basal cell carcinoma; CSCC, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma;
  dMMR, mismatch repair deficient; FDA, US Food and Drug Administration; HHI, hedgehog
  pathway inhibitor; ICI, immune checkpoint inhibitor; MCC, Merkel cell carcinoma;
  MSI, microsatellite instability; NMSC, nonmelanoma skin cancer; TMB, tumor mutational
  burden.
