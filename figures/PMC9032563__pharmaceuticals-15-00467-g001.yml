caption: NO in pathophysiological conditions. NO-mediated activation of cGMP, PKG,
  and VASP can cause platelet inhibition, whereas NO-mediated induction of pro-apoptotic
  proteins (PARP, AIF, cytochrome C, and cleaved caspase-3) can induce cell death.
  Furthermore, NO-mediated activation of cGMP, PKG, Rho A, and Rho kinase can alter
  smooth muscle relaxation, whereas inhibition of NAD, NADPH, and GSH by NO increases
  cell death. Moreover, lipid peroxidation caused by NO leads to oxidative stress
  or damage, and S-nitrosylation induced by NO may lead to neurotoxicity or neurodegeneration.
  In addition, NO-mediated induction of PKG and calcium signaling leads to excitotoxicity
  and contraction effects. NO is also involved in neutrophil infiltration and endothelial
  dysfunction through effects on mitochondrial respiration, NK cell toxicity, and
  activation of the GAPDH-PARP pathway and its functions [].
