caption: Active-subnetwork-oriented pathway enrichment of DEPs in HA-CRC and biological
  verification. Bubble chart of enrichment results of HA-CRC (A), and consolidated
  active subnetworks of HA-CRC (B) are shown. Please refer to the legend of  for other
  analytical settings and specifications. All significantly enriched terms and their
  corresponding sub-networks are shown. (C,D) IB analysis on ISGylated proteins comparing
  the HA-CRC with the HA-RT tissues (C), and the gray scale statistics (D). Huh-7
  cells treated with and without 500 U/mL IFN-α were used as positive and negative
  controls, respectively.
