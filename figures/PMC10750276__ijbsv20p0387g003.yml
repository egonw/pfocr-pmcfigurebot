caption: Knockdown of KLF7 inhibits the growth and lung metastasis of COAD xenograft.
  (A, B) Male BALB/c nude mice were inoculated with the stable KLF7 knockdown and
  control cells in their right flank. Representative gross images (A) and subcutaneous
  xenograft tumor volumes (B) in the indicated groups (n = 4). (C, D) Representative
  staining results from H&E (C) and IHC (D Left) in the subcutaneous xenograft tumor,
  quantification of IHC staining for KLF7 and Ki67 are also presented (D right) (n
  = 4). (E, F) Representative gross images (E) and the number of lung metastases (F)
  from Male BALB/c nude mice that were injected with the stable KLF7 knockdown cells
  and control cells via the tail vein (n = 3). (G, H) Representative staining results
  from H&E (G) and IHC (H) for KLF7, Vimentin in lungs with metastatic nodules, quantification
  results of IHC staining are also presented (n = 3). Bar,1000 µm (G-20×), 200 µm
  (C, G-100×), and 100 µm (D, H). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001.
