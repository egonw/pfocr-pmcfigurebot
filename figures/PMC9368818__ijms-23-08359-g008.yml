caption: 'Effects of TAF9 overexpression on RGC apoptosis induced by rAION induction.
  (A) Left: representative images of double-stained apoptotic cells in the ganglion
  cell layer in each group. The apoptotic cells were stained in green, and the cell
  nuclei were counterstained with DAPI staining in blue. Right: Analysis of RGC apoptosis
  between the PBS- and AAV2-r-TAF9-treated groups. (B) Western blot analysis of TP53,
  TRIAP1, and CASP3 expressions in the PBS- and AAV2-r-TAF9-treated groups. (*: p
  < 0.05).'

  Factor Trigger a Novel Signaling Pathway (TAF9-P53-TRIAP1-CASP3) to Protect Retinal
  Ganglion Cells after Ischemic Optic Neuropathy.
