caption: 'CSPG4 signalling pathways. CSPG4 activates two major signalling cascades
  via its cytoplasmic domain: (i) the FAK integrin signalling pathway and (ii) the
  MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway. (i) The scaffold protein syntenin physically interacts with
  Src, and at the same time, integrin engagement recruits and stimulates the autophosphorylation
  of FAK. Syntenin then promotes FAK/Src complex formation to initiate phosphorylation
  of p130cas and PI3K. p130Cas phosphorylation initiates activation of the small Rho
  GTPase Rac, leading to cytoskeletal reorganisation. PI3K phosphorylation activates
  AKT which regulates transcriptional activity of NF-ÎºB, leading to survival chemoresistance.
  (ii) CSPG4 activates MAPK/ERK1/2 signalling through RTK-dependent and independent
  mechanisms. Activation of CSPG4 causes activation of small GTPase Ras, which stimulates
  MEK phosphorylation and then ERK1/2 phosphorylation. ERK1/2 then unregulated MITF
  and c-Met leading to enhanced EMT. ERK1/2 also has other targets, and along with
  Rac, promotes migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis.'
