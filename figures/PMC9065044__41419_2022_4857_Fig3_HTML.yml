figure_title: POU6F1 represses the growth and aggressiveness of LUAD cells in vitro
caption: 'A, B Western blotting and real-time qRT-PCR assays revealing the POU6F1
  expression in A549 and NCI-H1299 cells stably transfected with empty vector (mock)
  or POU6F1. C, D CCK8 and colony formation assays indicating cell viability of A549
  and NCI-H1299 cells stably transfected with mock or POU6F1. E, F Representative
  images (left panel) and quantification (right panel) of soft agar and transwell
  assays revealing the migration ability of A549 and NCI-H1299 cells stably transfected
  with mock or POU6F1. G Cell cycle detection in A549 and NCI-H1299 cells transfected
  with empty vector (pCMV-HA) or pCMV-HA-POU6F1. H Immunofluorescence revealing cycle
  change of A549 and NCI-H1299 cells transfected with pCMV-HA or pCMV-HA-POU6F1, and
  those co-transfected with pRetroX-G1-Red and pRetroX-SG2M-Cyan vector. Scale bar:
  100 μm. The student’s t-test compared the difference in B–G. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.'
