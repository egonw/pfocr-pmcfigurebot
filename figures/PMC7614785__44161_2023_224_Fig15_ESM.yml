figure_title: Effect of Tie2 silencing on gene expression in cultured Tie2 + FBs
caption: 'a. Quantifications of Tie2 (Tek) mRNA level in cultured Tie2+ FBs and Tie2-
  FBs (Passage 6) in comparison with murine endothelial cell line Bend.3 (n = 3 independent
  mice per group). b. Quantification of Tie2 (Tek) mRNA level in the Tie2+ FBs transduced
  with shTie2-A or shTie2-D vs scramble (SCR) control (n = 3 independent mice per
  group). c. Heatmap showing upregulated transcripts related to inflammatory cell
  migration, immune response, inflammatory response, and chemokine and chemotaxis
  pathways in the Tie2-silenced Tie2+FBs. d. Violin plots showing the upregulation
  of Ccl7, Ccl8, Pycard, C3, Socs1, Apod, and Il6 in the Tie2+ fibroblasts during
  feeding Western diet in Tie2WT mice. e. Circle plot showing the significant communications
  in the IL6 signaling pathway and CCL signaling pathway analyzed using CellChat.
  f. Quantification of CCL5 secreted in the Tie2+ fibroblasts after Tie2 silencing
  (n = 3 independent samples in SCR, n = 2 independent samples in shTie2-A, n = 3
  independent samples in shTie2-D; 6 h: P = 0.0016, 12 h: P = 3.59 × 10−9, 18 h: P = 3.0 × 10−14,
  12 h: P = 2.9 × 10−14). Values show mean ± s.d. Statistical significance was determined
  using Two-way ANOVA with Geisser-Greenhouse correction and Turkey’s multiple comparisons
  test to the scramble control.'
