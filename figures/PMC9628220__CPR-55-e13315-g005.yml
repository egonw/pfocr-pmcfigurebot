caption: 'FGF10 overexpression alleviates UVB‐induced skin injury. (A) HE staining
  of AAV‐GFP or AAV‐Fgf10 treated with or without UVB (n = 3). Scale bars = 100 μm.
  (B) Immunohistochemical staining of PCNA in the skin of AAV‐GFP or AAV‐Fgf10 treated
  with or without UVB. The positive staining (brown) demonstrated positive expression
  (n = 3). Scale bars = 100 μm. (C) Representative IHC of Col1a1 in the skin of AAV‐GFP
  or AAV‐Fgf10 treated with or without UVB. The positive staining (brown) demonstrated
  positive expression (n = 3). Scale bars = 20 μm. (D) Immunofluorescence staining
  of γ‐H2AX in the skin of AAV‐GFP or AAV‐Fgf10 treated with or without UVB (n = 3).
  Scale bars = 100 μm. (E) Quantification of epidermal thickness from (A). (F) Quantification
  of AOD from (B). (G) Quantification of AOD from (C). (H) Quantification percentage
  of γ‐H2AX‐positive from (D). The data were presented as the means ± SEM. ***P < 0.001,
  **P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001, ##P < 0.01, #P < 0.05, vs. the corresponding UVB untreated
  AAV‐GFP group'
