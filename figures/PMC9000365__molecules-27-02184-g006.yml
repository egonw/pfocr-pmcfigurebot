caption: Adenosine stimulated canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The luciferase
  activity in WRHEK293A reporter cells was assessed after treatment with adenosine
  and NECA for 24 h in the presence/absence of IWR1, a Wnt inhibitor. Wnt3a was used
  as a positive control. The data represent the means of six independent samples.
  N.T, non-treated control; Significantly different compared with N.T (* p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001).
