caption: The effects of FDLE on cell viability of colorectal cancer cell lines (HCT-116
  and HT-29) and normal mouse embryonic fibroblast cell (NIH3T3) in non-inflammatory
  and inflammatory states by MTT. The cells were treated with various concentrations
  of FDLE for 24, 48 and 72 h. The cell viability was calculated comparing to untreated
  control cells after 24, 48 and 72 h of incubation. (A–C) The cell viability of HCT-116,
  HT-29 and NIH3T3 cells in non-inflammatory state. (D–F) The cell viability of HCT-116,
  HT-29 and NIH3T3 cells in inflammatory state. The results were represented as mean
  ± SD of three independent experiments, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, ****
  p < 0.0001.
