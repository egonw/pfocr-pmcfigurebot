caption: 'H2 can relieve the hippocampal histopathology damage and improve the 7‐day
  survival rates in septic mice. At 24 h following sham or CLP operation, (A) haematoxylin
  and eosin staining was used to detect the hippocampal histopathology changes. Regular
  morphology of the pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus was observed in the sham
  and sham + H2 groups. There were a large number of damaged neurons (indicated using
  black arrows) in the CLP group, and a significantly decreased number following H2
  treatment (C). Neuronal apoptosis was detected by TUNEL staining (B); and the TUNEL‐positive
  cells per high‐powered field are counted (D). n = 5 per group. (E). The survival
  rates of mice were recorded for 7 days (n = 20). *p < 0.05 vs. Sham group, #p < 0.05
  vs. CLP group. CLP, cecal ligation and puncture; H2, hydrogen'
