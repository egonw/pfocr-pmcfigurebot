caption: Licoricidin blocked the ICMT/Ras signaling pathway in vivo. (A) Immunohistochemical
  staining images of ICMT in xenografted tumors treated with different concentrations
  of licoricidin. (B) Mean densities of positively expressed ICMT protein were calculated
  from five random fields of view by Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software for quantitative
  analysis. (C) Expression levels of proteins (ICMT, Ras-GTP, p-Raf, and p-Erk) taking
  part in the ICMT/Ras signaling pathway in xenografted tumors were assessed by Western
  blot analysis and normalized by reference genes for quantitative analysis. Results
  are displayed as mean ± SD of three independent experiments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  and ***p < 0.001. LCD, licoricidin. 5-FU, 5-fluorouracil. Scale bar, 50 μm.
