figure_title: STAT3 deficiency prevents GVHD in target organs while preserving GVL
  activity in lymphohematopoietic tissues
caption: In GVHD target organs, activated T cells undergo metabolic reprogramming
  to sustain inflammatory T cell responses via the glutathione pathway. However, in
  the absence of STAT3, PD-1 signaling triggers high levels of Mito-ROS and decreased
  glutathione synthesis, which inhibits Myc activity and ATP production to impair
  metabolic reprogramming. These changes lead to T cell dysfunction, limiting T cell
  expansion and effector functions in target tissues, thus preventing GVHD. The lower
  abundance of PD-L1 in the spleen and other lymphohematopoietic tissues leads to
  lower PD-1 signaling, which allows metabolic reprogramming that supports T cell
  expansion and preserves GVL activity.
