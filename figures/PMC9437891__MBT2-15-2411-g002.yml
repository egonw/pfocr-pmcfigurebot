caption: Activation of PproHJ‐sfGFP (Sp) under exposure to kanamycin with or without
  osmostress pre‐treatment. After reaching OD600 0.35, the culture was split into
  two equal volumes where one part was subjected to 0.6 M NaCl for 90 min, and the
  second one was kept in the neutral osmolarity SMM. After the preadaptation step,
  cultures were washed in a fresh SMM medium without NaCl and distributed to the 96‐well
  plate containing increasing concentrations of kanamycin. (A) and (B) represent changes
  of the relative fluorescent units in time of differently preadapted B. subtilis
  cultures in the presence of increasing concentrations of kanamycin (0–125 µg ml−1).
  (C) and (D) show corresponding growth curves of cultures without and with 90 min
  0.6 M NaCl pretreatment. The black curve indicates the PproHJ activity of cultures
  without kanamycin for each experiment. The blue line indicates cultures that were
  continuously exposed to 0.6 M NaCl. The dotted line indicates the increase in cell
  lysis. All measurements were performed in biological triplicates, and the mean values
  were plotted on the graphs. The relative fluorescent signal was estimated by dividing
  the GFP signal by the cell density. The value is represented in arbitrary units.
