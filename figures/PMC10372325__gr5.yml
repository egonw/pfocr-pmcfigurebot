caption: Pathway analyses show that cellular processes central to vascular healing
  are delayed in diabetic rats. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed
  for differentially up- and down-regulated genes from different time points (intact,
  20 hours, 2 and 6 weeks) after injury. Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats are characterized
  by impaired inflammatory response in the early phase of vascular healing, aberrant
  extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and a delayed but protracted induction of
  cell proliferation. Green and red bubbles represent up- and down-regulated pathways,
  respectively. The increasing color gradient indicates the increasing P-value. Only
  significant pathways with P < .05 are shown. ERK, Extracellular signal-regulated
  kinases; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; RNAP II, RNA polymerase II.
