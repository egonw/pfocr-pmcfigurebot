caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis of B cellsscRNAseq was performed to assess the
  transcriptomes of T4 PBMCs from 4 matched controls and low responders (pairs 12–15).(A)
  Genes differentially expressed by B cells from controls and low responders.(B) IPA
  canonical pathway analysis of genes differentially expressed by B cells from controls
  and low responders.(C) IPA upstream pathway analysis was employed to predict signaling
  pathways driving the changes in canonical pathways. Only pathways analyzed by IPA
  with a p<0.0001 are in the figure. Please refer to  for the entire list.
