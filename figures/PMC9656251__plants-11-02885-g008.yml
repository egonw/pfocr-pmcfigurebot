caption: 'Real-time PCR quantification of the key MIA pathway genes in C. roseus in
  different X-ray-treated and control plants. The pathway genes are represented as:
  SLS, secologanin synthase; TDC, tryptophan decarboxylase; STR, strictosidine synthase;
  SGD, strictosidine b-D-glucosidase; T16H, tabersonine 16-hydroxylase; DAT, deacetylvindoline
  acetyltransferase; PRX1 peroxidase, and transcription factors- ORCA2, and WRKY1,
  key regulators of the MIA pathway, were determined using Livak’s 2−ΔΔCt method (along
  with controls). The Ct value (threshold cycle) for each gene was normalized against
  the Ct from C. roseus RSP9 gene (primer list provided in ). * represents that a
  significant difference was observed from the respective control at p < 0.05 after
  applying post hoc Dunnett’s test (n = 3).'
