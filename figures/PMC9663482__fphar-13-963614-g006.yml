caption: Quercetin suppresses GSK3β/β-catenin/ZEB1 pathway in GBM. (A) Western blotting
  analysis of the expression of p-GSK-3β (Ser 9), GSK-3β, β-catenin, and ZEB1 after
  treatment with quercetin (0, 20, 40, 80 μM) in U87MG and CHG-5 cell lines. The data
  are shown as the mean ± SD of three experiments. (B) RT-qPCR was used to examine
  the mRNA levels of GSK-3β, β-catenin, and ZEB1 after treatment with quercetin (0,
  20, 40, 80 μM) in U87MG and CHG-5 cell lines. All data are shown as the mean ± SD
  of three experiments. *p＜0.05, **p＜0.01 vs. control group. (C)Western blotting was
  used to detect the expression of β-catenin in cytoplasm and nucleus of U87MG and
  CHG-5 cell lines treated with quercetin (0, 20, 40, 80 μM). The data are shown as
  the mean ± SD of three experiments. *p＜0.05, **p＜0.01 vs. control group. (D) Immunofluorescence
  images to exhibit the distribution of β-catenin in U87MG and CHG-5 cell lines when
  treated with quercetin (0, 20, 40, 80μM). Scale bar, 20 μm.
