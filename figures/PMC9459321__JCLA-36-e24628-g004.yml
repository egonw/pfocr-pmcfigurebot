caption: 'GNPNAT1 was selected as the candidate gene after screening. (A, B) PCA and
  heatmap were based on the top 1000 probe sites with the largest variance after removal
  of the outliers, and the final 26 pairs of matched methylated samples were obtained.
  In PCA, pink circles were for the normal group and blue triangles were for the tumor
  group. In heatmap, the red color indicated upregulated genes, while the blue color
  signified downregulated genes. (C, D) Volcano plot displayed the pattern of upregulated
  and downregulated genes, and a clustering heatmap indicated the varied expression
  of genes in two groups after the deep filtration of DMPs with deltaβ >0.2 and FDR
  <0.05 as threshold. The red dots in the left plot represented upregulated genes,
  blue dots denoted downregulated genes with statistical significance, and gray dots
  exhibited no differentially expressed genes of DMPs. The dark blue in the right
  plot indicated up‐regulated genes, while the light blue color signified down‐regulated
  genes. (E) The Venn Diagram analysis was conducted to determine the intersection
  of DMPs and DEGs under the screening standard of FDR <0.05 and log2FC >1. Methylation‐driving
  genes were harvested after differential expression analysis towards RNA‐seq via
  edgeR. (F, G) GO and KEGG pathway analyses were carried out for predicting the differentially
  expressed genes. The y‐coordinate in (F) represented the GO entry, and the abscissa
  was the ratio of genes enriched on the GO entry to the total target genes. The color
  in the right side indicated the size of the p value, while the bubble size represents
  the number of genes enriched on the modified GO entry. PCA: principal component
  analysis, FDR: False Discovery Rate, DMPs: differential methylated points, DEGs,
  differentially expressed genes, GO, Gene ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
  Genomes.'
