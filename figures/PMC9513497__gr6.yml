caption: 'ASCT2 drives the proinflammatory SASP via IL-1α/NF-κB feedback loop through
  interacting with precursor IL-1α at Lys82 of senescent HSCs. (A) Protein of p31–IL-1α
  and p16–IL-1α was measured by Western blot analysis with 4-OHT (n = 3 per group).
  (B) Detection of intracellular IL-1α by ELISA with 4-OHT (n = 3 per group). (C)
  mRNAs of proinflammatory SASP including IL1A, IL1B, IL6 and IL8 were measured by
  qPCR (n = 5 per group). (D) Co-IP of ASCT2 with IL-1α in LX2 cells, as detected
  by Western blot analysis (n = 3 per group). (E) Schematic of fragments of IL-1α
  that were fused to GST (top) and were transfection into 293T cells. Binding of ASCT2
  to GST-IL-1α proteins was detected by Western blot (bottom, n = 3 per group). FL:
  full length; F1: domain 1–112; F2: domain 112–271; F3: NLS domain (80–88) deletion;
  F4: K82N mutation. (F) rIL-1α protein was added to senescent (ASCT2 depletion or
  etoposide treatment) LX2 cells, and IL1R1 signaling cascade indicators were analyzed
  by Western blotting (n = 3 per group). (G) rIL-1α protein was added to senescent
  (ASCT2 depletion or etoposide treatment) LX2 cells, and NF-κB protein was measured
  in nuclear and cytoplasmic lysates by Western blot (n = 3 per group). (H) Relative
  luciferase measurement of NF-κB in indicated cells (n = 5–6 per group). (I) ASCT2
  depletion-senescent LX2 cells were treated with rIL-1α protein and addressed in
  NF-κB inhibitor PDTC, and the analysis of mRNAs of proinflammatory SASP IL1A, IL1B,
  IL6 and IL8 by qPCR (n = 5–6 per group). Bars indicate mean ± SEM; ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01;
  ns, no significance.'
