figure_title: Effects of AmphoB on WT IFITM3–driven trafficking defects
caption: (A) Representative picture obtained in the presence of low concentrations
  of WT IFITM3. This picture is in complement to the results presented in  and has
  been included in the graph of the same Figure. (B) WT and IFITMs-KO HeLa cells were
  transfected with DNA coding VSVg and treated for 18 h with 1 μM of AmphoB before
  analysis of the cell surface expression levels of VSVg by flow cytometry. The picture
  presents representative results, as well as the quantification of the MFI obtained
  in three experiments. *P-value < 0.041 and nonsignificant (ns) after a two-tailed
  t test between the indicated conditions. Source data are provided in the relevant
  section.
