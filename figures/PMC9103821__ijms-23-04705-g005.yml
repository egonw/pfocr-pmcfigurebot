caption: Inhibition of the Notch signaling pathway after liver cancer induction reduced
  cancer cell migration and improved survival. (A) Tg(fabp10a:Tet3G;TRE3G:krasG12V
  -ZsGreen1) with Tg(Hsp70l:dnMAML-GFP) double transgenic fish line treatment strategy
  to observe the migration of cancer cells. (B) Zebrafish larvae were classified into
  three classes, I, II, and III, by the number of cancer cells outside the liver and
  the number of locations of metastases. (C) The proportion of the total number of
  larvae in different metastasis classes in the krasG12V+ (n = 46) and krasG12V+ and
  dnMAML+ (n = 130) groups at 9 dpf. (D) Kaplan–Meier survival curves of the DOX-induced
  krasG12V+ (n = 191) and krasG12V+ and dnMAML+ (n = 163) groups. p values for survival
  curves were calculated by log-rank test. Scale bars, 100 μm.
