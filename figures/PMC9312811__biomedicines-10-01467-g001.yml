caption: Chrysin inhibits cell viability in A375SM and A375P human melanoma cancer
  cells. (A) Chemical structure of chrysin. (B) A375SM and A375P cells were seeded
  in 96-well plates, incubated for 24 h, and then treated with the indicated concentration
  of chrysin for 24 h. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. Data are presented
  as the mean and standard deviation for three samples. Significance was determined
  by Studentâ€™s t-test, * p < 0.05, compared with the control.
