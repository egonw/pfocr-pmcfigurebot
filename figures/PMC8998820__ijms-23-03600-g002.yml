caption: 'Mitochondrial dysfunction and IL-33 induced in Natterin response. Natterin
  (1 μg) diluted in PBS was injected i.p. in BL6 WT mice previously treated for 1
  h with i.p. injection of cyclosporin A at 10 μM (WT CycA_Natterin) or DPI at 100
  μM (WT DPI_Natterin) (A). As a negative control, mice were injected i.p. with PBS
  (WT_PBS). As a positive control, mice were only injected with Natterin (WT_Natterin).
  Two hours after injection, mice were killed and the peritoneal cavities were washed
  to obtain exudates. Peritoneal exudate cells were harvested and the number of neutrophils
  related to total cell number was evaluated in cytospin slides stained with the Diff-Quick
  staining kit. Each bar represents the mean ± SEM of 3–5 animals/group. * p < 0.05
  compared with WT_PBS group and # p < 0.05 compared with WT_Natterin group. Concentrated
  supernatant of peritoneal exudates from WT_PBS or WT_Natterin groups of mice were
  analyzed for the content of double-stranded DNA using Quant-iTPicoGreen dsDNA reagent
  (B). Proteins present in concentrated supernatant or cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins
  (C) collected 2 h after Natterin injection were analyzed using the iBindTM Flex
  Western System with goat anti-mouse IL-33 (processed form: 18 to 20 kDa) followed
  by the secondary antibody anti-goat IgG-HRP. The β-tubulin was used as housekeeping
  protein. The immune complex was revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection
  system.'
