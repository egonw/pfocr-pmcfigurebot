caption: 'miR-16-5p and miR-200a-3p: serum levels expressed during T1D progression
  and canonical pathways most significantly enriched by serum miRNAs through Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis (IPA). AbP group (individuals with islet autoantibodies without
  diabetes; n = 25), recent-onset type 1 diabetes (T1D) group (newly diagnosed T1D
  patients with duration â‰¤6 months; n = 30), and T1D 2-5y group (patients with T1D
  with 2 to 5 years of duration; n = 26) in comparison with health controls. The stacked
  bar chart displays the percentage of target DEGs molecules present in each pathway.
  The Benjamini-Hochberg method was used to adjust the right-tailed Fischer''s exact
  test p value, which was always <0.001.'
