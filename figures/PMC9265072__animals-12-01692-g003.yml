caption: Chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) inhibits milk fat synthesis in bovine mammary
  epithelial cells (BMECs) via the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway.
  BMECs were treated with different concentrations of COS (0, 100, 150 μg/mL) for
  24 h. (A) Relative mRNA expression of SREBP1 and AMPK in BMECs treated with COS.
  A greyscale scan quantified the relative folds of AMPK and its downstream genes
  protein levels from the western blots. AMPK and p-AMPK (B); HSL and PPARα (C); SREBP1
  and SCD1 (D) protein levels were detected by Western blotting. Relative protein
  expression levels of AMPK, p-AMPK, HSL, PPARα, SREBP1 and SCD1 compared to that
  of β-actin (E–G). Data were the mean ± SE from three independent experiments. Different
  small letters showed significant difference (p < 0.05), different capital letters
  showed extremely significant difference (p < 0.01), and the same letters or unmarked
  letters had no significant difference.
