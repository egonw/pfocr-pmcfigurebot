caption: Schematic representation of the predicted signaling pathway of how CIAPIN1
  promotes the metastasis and chemoresistance of CCA. CIAPIN1 was predicted to activate
  SMAD2 signal transduction and involve in the TGF-Î² signaling pathway via NOS1. The
  result indicated an increase in migration and invasion, which lead to metastasis
  in CCA. CIAPIN1 interacted directly with doxorubicin, led to promote chemoresistance
  function in CCA cells. The molecules in red rectangles were demonstrated in the
  present study.
