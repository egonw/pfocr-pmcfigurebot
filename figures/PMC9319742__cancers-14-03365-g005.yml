caption: CDKN1A and VEGFA are two key differential genes (DGs) in SNFT post homotypic/heterotypic
  activation of the Notch3 pathway. (A) Modulation in 107 Notch3 target genes in FACS
  sorted labelled SNFT cells from co-culture (CC) with five Jagged-1 expressing cells
  (OVCAR3, NIH3T3J1-A, NIH3T3J1-B, CAF-III, and CAF-VI) as compared to NIH3T3wt cells
  is represented by the heatmap. (B,C) The Venn diagram shows the unique and overlapping
  differential genes across five co-cultures. Among them, CDKN1A, VEGFA, and TNFSF10
  exhibited significant up-regulation. At the same time, SERPINA3 (only in CAF-III
  co-culture SNFT) and FOXC1 showed down-regulated expression. (D) Expressions of
  CDKN1A and VEGFA (the two most significant DGs) were increased after Jag1 peptide
  treatment, which declined after DAPT treatment in SNFT (n = 2) (see  for expression
  values). (E,F) Immunofluorescence images showing the expression level and localization
  of p21 in SNFT after peptide treatment or cisplatin treatment or treatment with
  both. Peptide treatment significantly augmented nuclear and cytoplasmic localization
  of p21, which further increased after cisplatin along with peptide treatment. Cisplatin
  alone did not cause any change in nuclear or cytoplasmic p21 compared to untreated
  (n = 3). The nuclear-cytoplasmic intensity tool, an ImageJ macros toolset, was used
  to quantify the expression. * p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤ 0.001.
