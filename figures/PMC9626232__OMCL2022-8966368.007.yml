caption: TF3 activated the MAPK pathway in OS cell lines. OS cells were treated with
  0.05% DMSO (vehicle control) or the indicated concentrations (0, 40, 80, and 120 μM)
  of TF3 for 24 h. (a, b) Western blotting and statistical analyses of MAPK signalling
  pathway-related proteins, including p-JNK, p-P38, p-ERK, JNK, P38, and ERK, in MG63
  and HOS cells. The data are presented as the mean ± SD (n = 3). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P <
  0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001 vs. the vehicle control group.
