caption: 'The schematic representation of the mechanism of action of natural compounds
  against BC using the MDM2 signaling pathway. Natural compounds induce apoptosis
  by inhibiting the NFAT1-MDM2 signaling pathway to reduce cancer. NFAT1: nuclear
  factor of activated T cells 1; MDM2: mouse double minute 2 homolog; CDK: cyclin-dependent
  kinase; Chk: checkpoint kinase; Bcl-2: B-cell lymphoma 2; Bax: BCL2-associated X
  protein; PARP: poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. This figure is reproduced from Qin
