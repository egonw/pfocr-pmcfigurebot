caption: Schematic representation of the origin and evolution of microalgae by primary
  and secondary endosymbiosis. A single primary endosymbiosis between an ancestral
  cyanobacterium and an ancestral heterotrophic eukaryote led to the groups of Glaucophyta,
  Rodophyta, and Chlorophyta. Subsequently, plastids extended to other eukaryotes
  from chlorophytes and rodophytes by eukaryote to eukaryote endosymbiotic events.
  On the one hand, a single secondary endosymbiosis between a Rodophyta ancestor and
  a heterotrophic host led to cryptophytes, haptophytes, and stramenopiles. On the
  other hand, two different secondary endosymbiosis events from two Chlorophyta ancestors
  and two unrelated hosts led to the lineages of Chlorarachniophyta and Euglenophyta.
