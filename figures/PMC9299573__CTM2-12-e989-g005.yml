caption: Overexpression of PTEN suppresses non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell
  chemoresistance, proliferation and apoptotic resistance. PTEN was knocked down or
  overexpressed in H1299 and HCC8237 cells. (A and B) PTEN expression in these cells
  was examined via qPCR and Western blotting. Cellular viability (C) and DDP IC50
  values (D) were measured. (E) The proliferation of these cells was monitored via
  EdU uptake assay in the absence (left) or presence of DDP (2 μg/ml; Right). (F)
  The proliferation of these cells was monitored via colony formation assay in the
  absence (left) or presence of DDP (2 μg/ml; Right). (G) The apoptotic ratio values
  for these cells were measured via Hoechst staining in the absence (left) or presence
  of DDP (20 μM; Right). (H and I) PI3K‐p85, PI3K‐p100, PI3K, pAKT and AKT levels
  were measured via Western blotting the indicated cells in the presence or absence
  of DDP treatment. GAPDH employed as a normalization control. Outcomes are means
  ± standard deviation (SD) (*p < .05; **p < .01; ***p < .001)

  the PTEN/PI3K‐AKT pathway to promote the progression and chemoresistance of non‐small
  cell lung cancer.
