caption: 'Potential target gene HPSE2 is involved in the serrated pathway. A: Schematic
  Venn diagram of transfer RNA halves (5′tiRNA)-Pro-TGG target gene prediction. B:
  Predicted interaction position between 5′tiRNA-Pro-TGG and 3′UTR of HPSE2. C: Correlation
  analysis of the expression of 5′tiRNA-Pro-TGG and HPSE2 (n = 10). D: Expression
  level of HPSE2 in common adenoma, right control colon tissue, sessile serrated lesion
  (SSL), right uninvolved colon, and serrated polyp syndrome in GSE76987. E: Expression
  level of HPSE2 in SSLs and normal control (n = 3). F: HPSE2 expression in BRAF-mut
  colorectal cancer (CRC) was lower in BRAF-wild CRC. G: Kaplan–Meier survival curves
  for the overall survival (OS) of CRC patients in HPSE2-high and HPSE2-low groups.
  The OS of patients with HPSE2-low was worse compared to that of patients with HPSE2-high.
  aP < 0.05, bP < 0.01. AD: Common adenoma; CR: Right control colon tissue; SSL: Sessile
  serrated lesion; UR: Right uninvolved colon; SPS: Serrated polyp syndrome; OS: Overall
  survival; CRC: Colorectal cancer; NC: Normal control; tRF: Transfer RNA-related
  fragment; tiRNA: Transfer RNA halves.'
