caption: 'Effect of the Rho signaling pathway on TGF-β1-induced osteoclastogenesis.
  (A) RAW264.7 cells were cultured for 5 days with TGF-β1 and RANKL in the presence
  or absence of SB431542. Protein levels of total RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 were determined
  by western blotting. (B) The levels of GTP-bound RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 were detected
  by GLISAs (n = 3). (C) HEK293T cells were transfected with the WT TGF-β1 or p.R218C
  mutant plasmid for 48 h. Cell lysates were collected for GLISAs of GTP-bound RhoA,
  Rac1, and Cdc42 levels (n = 3). (D, E) Representative images of TRAP staining (D)
  (bar: 200 μm) and areas of TRAP‐positive multinucleated (≥ 3 nuclei) RAW264.7 cells
  (E) after 5 days of culture. Cells were cultured with RANKL and TGF-β1 in the presence
  or absence of a Rho GTPase inhibitor (Y27632 or NSC23766) (n = 5). (F, G) RAW264.7
  cells were cultured on OsteoAssay plates for 5 days with RANKL and TGF-β1 in the
  presence or absence of a Rho GTPase inhibitor (Y27632 or NSC23766). Resorption lacunae
  were visualized by bright-field microscopy (n = 3). Bar: 100 μm. (H, I) Representative
  images of Raw264.7 cells (stained with crystal violet) on the lower surface of a
  Transwell membrane (H) and quantitative analysis of cell migration by cell counting
  (I) after 2 days of culture. Cells were cultured alone (control), with RANKL, with
  RANKL plus TGF-β1, or with RANKL plus TGF-β1 plus an inhibitor (SB431542, Y27632,
  or NSC23766) (n = 3). Bar: 100 μm. (J, K) Protein levels of FAK and p-FAK were determined
  by western blotting, and the gray values were statistically analyzed. (L) the mRNA
  levels of Integrin β1 and Integrin β3 were determined by quantitative RT‐PCR in
  RAW264.7 cells cultured for 5 days (n = 3). Data represent means ± SD. *p < 0.05;
  **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001; ns: no significance.'
