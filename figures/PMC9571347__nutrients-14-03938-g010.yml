caption: 'GS-induced activation of the SIRT1/AMPK signaling pathway was significantly
  reversed in SIRT1LKO mice. (A) Immunofluorescent staining for ROS levels in liver
  tissue. (B) Protein levels of SIRT1, p-AMPK, AMPK, and Nrf2 levels in WT and SIRT1LKO
  after GS treatment. Significantly different from ANIT (WT), ** p < 0.01, or ANIT+GS
  (WT), ## p < 0.01.'
