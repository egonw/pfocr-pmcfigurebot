caption: RARγ interacted with IκBα and promoted the activation of NF-κB signaling
  pathway. (a) C28/I2 cells overexpressing RARγ were treated with TNF-α (30 ng/mL)
  for 4 hours, and the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway was detected by western
  blot. (b) Online public databases predict that RARγ may interact with IκBα and P65
  proteins in NF-κB signaling pathways (STRING, https://cn.string-db.org/and GeneMANIA,
  http://genemania.org/). (c) CO-IP assay was used to verify whether the exogenous
  overexpressed RARγ-Flag protein interacts with IκBα or P65. (d) The CO-IP assay
  was further used to verify whether the endogenous RARγ protein interacted with IκBα
  or P65. (e) The colocalization of RARγ and IκBα in C28/I2 cells was detected by
  immunofluorescence. Magnification in ×1000.
