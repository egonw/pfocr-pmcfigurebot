caption: 'Inhibitory effect of ACT on DSS-induced ulcerative colitis in mice. (A)
  Chemical structure of ACT. (B) Body weight of mice treated with ACT and DSS. (C
  and D) Effect of ACT on DSS-induced shortening of the colon. (E) Representative
  images of the inhibitory effect of ACT on DSS-induced colon injury. The arrows indicate
  mucosal erosion, reduction of crypts and infiltration of inflammatory cells. (F)
  Inhibitory effect of ACT on DSS-induced increase of DAI. (n=6). **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001
  vs. control; #P<0.05, ##P<0.01 and ###P<0.001 vs. DSS. ACT, acteoside; DSS, dextran
  sulphate sodium; DAI, disease activity index.'
