caption: Activation of STAT5-ACSL1 signaling pathway protects against alcohol-induced
  liver injury. Wild-type Flox mice and Acsl1Δhep mice with or without Stat5b overexpression
  (Stat5b OE) were subjected to alcohol feeding for 8 weeks. (A) Western blot assay
  of proteins related to apoptotic and necroptotic cell death (n = 3/group). (B) qPCR
  analysis of hepatic mRNA levels of ACSL1, ACSL3, ACSL4, and ACSL5 (n = 6/group).
  (C–D) Serum levels of ALT (C) and AST (D) (n = 5/group). (E) Kaplan–Meier survival
  analysis of survival probability during 8 weeks of alcohol feeding. (F-G) Flow cytometry
  analysis of hepatic infiltration of Ly6G+CD1+ neutrophils (f) and quantification
  (g), gated on singlet 7AAD− CD45+ cells. (n = 4/group). (H) qPCR analysis of hepatic
  mRNA levels of Lcn2 (n = 6/group). (I) Serum levels of LCN2 (n = 5/group). Data
  are presented as mean ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, values with different superscripts
  are significantly different.
