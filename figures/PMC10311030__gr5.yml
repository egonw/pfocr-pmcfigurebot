caption: Exosome-transported miR-18a-5p was expressed by PCa cells. (A) Representative
  transmission electron microscopy images of PCa-EXO. (B) Average size distribution
  of PCa-EXO by using DLS. (C) Western blot detection of exosome marker proteins.
  (D–F) Osteogenic-induced MC3T3-E1 treated with C4-2B-EXO. (D) The expression of
  osteogenic differentiation marker proteins. (E) ALP staining. (F) Alizarin red S
  staining. (G) The mRNA abundance of miR-18a-5p in C4-2B cells, C4-2B cells supernatants
  (CS), C4-2B-EXO, and MC3T3-E1 cells cocultured with C4-2B cell supernatant, respectively.
  (H)In situ hybridization of miR-18a-5p in MC3T3-E1 cells by treated with CS, CS-GW4869
  or EXO from PCa cells. Set PBS as control group, (brown represents positive). The
  data are represented as mean ± SEM or SD. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, ns
  P > 0.05.
