caption: Quantification of the dynamics of O-GlcNAcylated proteins through metabolic
  labeling using 13C6-glucose. (A) Hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) and the metabolic
  labeling strategy of UDP-GlcNAc from 13C6-glucose. Heavily labeled species are marked
  with an asterisk. (B) Workflow for analysis of protein O-GlcNAcylation, including
  isotopic labeling, sample preparation, and mass spectrometric analysis. (Adapted
