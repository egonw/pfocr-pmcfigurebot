caption: Lactate metabolism and pentose phosphate pathway activation inhibit ferroptosis
  in COMM-SUS cells. (A) COMM-1 SUS cells were treated with or without the MCT1 inhibitor,
  AZD3965, and then cultured in HHS for 12, 24 and 48 h. Cell viabilities were analyzed.
  (B) Cell viabilities of COMM-1 cells were measured following treatment with or without
  AZD3965 for 6 h, and cultured with 2 mM H2O2 for 6 h. (C and D) The amount of intracellular
  NADPH and NADH of COMM-1 cells were measured after treating with 100 nM AZD3965
  for 24 h. (E and F) COMM-1 AD cells were treated with AZD3965, and then cultured
  in HHS for 12, 24 and 48 h. Cell viabilities and morphologies were analyzed. (G
  and H) Cell viabilities of COMM-1 SUS cells were measured after siRNA transfection
  targeting PPP, FASP and FMP, respectively. Significance was determined using one-way
  ANONA (*P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 and ****P<0.0001; ns, not significant, P>0.05).
  COMM, Chinese oral mucosal melanoma; COMM-AD, cells with adhesive morphology; COMM-SUS,
  cells grown in suspension; HHS, healthy human serum.
