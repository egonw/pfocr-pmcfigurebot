caption: BCKDK promotes OC cell proliferation. (a) Growth curves of vector control
  cells (SKOV3-Mock) and BCKDK-overexpressing cells (SKOV3-BCKDK). Insert shows verification
  of the cell lines identified by western blot. Data are represented as mean ± standard
  deviation from the triplicate experiments. The asterisk indicates a significant
  increase in cell number in SKOV3-BCKDK cells compared with SKOV3-Mock cells (∗P
  < 0.05). (b) Growth curves of vector control cells (OVCAR3-Mock) and BCKDK-overexpressing
  cells (OVCAR3-BCKDK). Insert shows verification of the cell lines identified by
  western blot. Data are represented as mean ± standard deviation from the triplicate
  experiments. The asterisk indicates a significant increase in cell number in OVCAR3-BCKDK
  cells compared with OVCAR3-Mock cells (∗∗P < 0.01). (c) BCKDK can transform SKOV3
  cells ex vivo as illustrated by growth of BCKDK transformed cells in soft agar.
  Photomicrograph of representative colony formation in soft agar of vector control
  cells (SKOV3-Mock) compared with BCKDK-overexpression cells (SKOV3-BCKDK) is shown
  (∗∗∗P < 0.001). (d) BCKDK can enhance the transformation of OVCAR3 cells ex vivo
  as illustrated by growth of BCKDK transformed cells in soft agar. Photomicrograph
  of representative colony formation in soft agar of vector control cells (OVCAR3-Mock)
  compared with BCKDK-overexpressing cells (OVCAR3-BCKDK) is shown (∗∗∗P < 0.001).
