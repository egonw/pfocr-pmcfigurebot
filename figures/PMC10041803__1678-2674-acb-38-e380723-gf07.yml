figure_title: Nrf2/HO-1 inhibitor reversed the neuroprotection of AS-IV after MCAO.
  Knockdown of Nrf2 reversed the neuroprotective effect of AS-IV at 72 h post MCAO.
  (a, b) Neurological scores and brain water content 72 h after MCAO in rats. (c)
  TUNEL staining. Knockdown of Nrf2 enhanced cell death in the hippocampus 72 h after
  MCAO. (d, f) Quantitative analysis of lipid ROS, MDA, and GSH levels. Data are represented
  as the mean ± SD
