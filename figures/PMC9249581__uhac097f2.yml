caption: 'a) Schematic representation of the metabolites and main enzymatic steps
  genes of the primary metabolism analyzed in this study. Broken arrows indicate several
  consecutive steps; b) Glucose, fructose, citric and malic acid content quantified
  by the HPLC methods; c) Gene expression profiling measured by Real time qPCR in
  samples from mature green (MG), breaker (B), breaker +7 days (B + 7) and ripe (R)
  fruits in WT and Bronze tomato line (n = 3). Biosynthetic genes are named according
  to the following abbreviations: SUS1, sucrose synthase 1; G6PDH, glucose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; DAHPS, 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase; SK,
  shikimate synthase.'
