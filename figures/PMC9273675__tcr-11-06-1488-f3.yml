caption: Underexpressed ETC genes were associated with tumor metastasis process and
  higher immune responds. (A) Gene expression of ETC genes. Positive logFC represents
  higher expression and negative logFC represents lower expression in mRCC. (B) A
  heatmap showing gene expression of each sample. The cell types were shown blow.
  (C) The differential enriched pathway based on GSVA result. (D) The GSVA score of
  each sample in differential enriched pathway based on GSVA result. (E,F) The GSEA
  results of TCGA sample based on ETC gene expression. FC, fold change; mRCC, metastatic
  renal cell carcinoma; pRCC, primary renal cell carcinoma; ETC, electron transport
  chain; GSVA, gene set variation analysis; GSEA, gene set enrichment analysis; TCGA,
  The Cancer Genome Atlas.
