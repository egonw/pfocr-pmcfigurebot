caption: Putative Kdo biosynthetic pathway in CroV and Fadolivirus (Mimiviridaefamily).
  The Kdo pathway follows the same path in bacteria and plants, and in silico analysis
  suggests that these two giant viruses encode all the enzymes required to produce
  this monosaccharide. The arrangement of the genes is given for CroV only (lower
  left part of the figure), and the arrows (in black) indicate the direction of the
  coding strand.
