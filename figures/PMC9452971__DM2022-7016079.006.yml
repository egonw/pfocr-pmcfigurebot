caption: Gefitinib inhibits CC proliferation and tumor growth through SEC61G. (a)
  After SiHa cells were given gefitinib (10 μM, 24 h) or DMSO, the expression of SEC61G
  was analyzed by qRT-PCR. (b) EdU proliferation assay. (c) Transwell detection of
  invasive ability of CC cells. After 48 h, crystal violet staining was performed
  and counted. (d) Detection of E-cadherin expression e. (e) Vimentin expression detection.
  (f) Schematic description of the regulatory mechanism of CC proliferation through
  SEC61G/MAPK signaling and therapeutic targets. ∗∗P < 0.01 and ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. DMSO
  group.
