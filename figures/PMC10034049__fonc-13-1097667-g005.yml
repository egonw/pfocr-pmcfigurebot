caption: Characterization and validation of two C-to-U RESs in colon cancer. (A) Patients
  with CSNK2B editing showed worse survival (log-rank test). (B) Patients with CSNK2B
  editing showed a worse response to drug treatments (chi-squared test). (C) Oncogenic
  CLDN18 expression level were upregulated in patients with CSNK2B editing. (D) Experimental
  validation of CSNK2B editing that promoted cell proliferation in colon cancer. (E)
  Patients with RPS14 editing show a better survival (log-rank test). (F) Patients
  with RPS14 editing show better response to drug treatments (chi-squared test). (G)
  Ribosome pathway upregulation was highly enriched in samples with RPS14 editing
  (top). In contrast, several oncogenic pathways, including PI3K-Akt signaling, were
  downregulated (bottom). (H) Experimental validation of RPS14 editing that suppressed
  cell proliferation in colon cancer. (D, H) Error bars indicate standard errors and
  P-values were calculated using the Student t-test (n=3, ***p < 0.001).
