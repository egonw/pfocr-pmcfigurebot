caption: 'Effect of ROCK2 silencing on the NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway in LPS-induced HK-2
  cells. (A) The protein expression of p-NF-κB p65/NF-κB p65, NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1
  p20/pro-caspase-1 in HK-2 cells in different groups was measured using western blotting.
  (B) PMA was used to treat LPS-induced, shRNA-ROCK2-transfected HK-2 cells or untransfected
  cells, then the protein expression levels of p-NF-κB p65/NF-κB p65, NLRP3, ASC,
  caspase-1 p20/pro-caspase-1 in HK-2 cells in different groups were measured using
  western blotting. ***P<0.001 vs. control; $$$P<0.001 vs. LPS; ###P<0.001 vs. LPS
  + shRNA-ROCK2 or LPS + shRNA-NC; ++P<0.01 and +++P<0.001 vs. DMSO + LPS + shRNA-ROCK2.
  ROCK2, Rho-associated protein kinase 2; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; sh, short hairpin;
  NC, negative control; NLRP3, NLR family pyrin domain containing 3; ASC, apoptosis-associated
  speck-like protein containing a CARD; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; p, phosphorylated;
  t, total.'
