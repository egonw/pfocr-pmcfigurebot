figure_title: Inhibition of Foxf2 enhances the differentiation of MSCs into osteoblasts
  via activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway
caption: a Gene expression in BMSCs isolated from the Foxf2f/f and Foxf2osp−/− mice
  by qPCR. Foxf2osp−/− BMSCs showed a significant increase in osteogenic markers.
  *, P < 0.05 versus the Foxf2f/f mice. b, c, and d RNA-seq data from calvaria of
  the Foxf2f/f and Foxf2osp−/− mice. b Loss of Foxf2 in osteoprogenitors significantly
  upregulated the expression of 57 genes while downregulating the expression of 633
  genes. c Bar chart of pathways with potentially differentially expressed genes extracted
  from calvarial bone expression data. The PANTHER server with default parameters
  for pathway analysis was used for pathway analysis. The length of each bar shows
  how many genes have been assigned to a given pathway. d There were significant changes
  in the expression of Wnt2b and Lgr5, which are associated with canonical Wnt signaling.
  e Gene expression in calvaria bones isolated from the Foxf2f/f and Foxf2osp−/− mice
  by qPCR. Foxf2osp−/− calvaria showed a significant increase in Wnt2b expression.
  f WNT2B protein levels in the Foxf2osp−/− mice based on Western blot analysis. Calvaria
  bones were isolated from the Foxf2f/f (control) or Foxf2osp−/− mice. *, P < 0.05
  versus the Foxf2f/f mice. All data represent the mean ± SEM.
