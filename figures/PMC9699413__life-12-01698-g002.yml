caption: Blue light (BL) activates the NF-κB signaling pathway in ARPE-19 cells. (A)
  In silico analysis of upstream transcription factors regulating the expression of
  DEGs by A2E+BL in ARPE-19 cells. The length of the bars represents the combined
  score from the Fisher exact test. The adjusted p-value represents the statistical
  significance for specific terms. (B) The effect of A2E+BL on the expression of a
  set of RELA target genes in ARPE-19 cells. (C) Validation of RNA-seq results by
  RT-qPCR (reverse transcript-quantitative polymerase chain reaction) analysis showing
  the mRNA levels of RELA target genes in ARPE-19 cells treated (+marked) with A2E,
  BL, or A2E+BL vs. non-treated control. The mRNA levels were normalized to that of
  18S rRNA. Each value represents mean ± SD (n = 3), *** p < 0.001. HMOX1, Heme Oxygenase
  1; HSP90AA1, heat shock protein 90 alpha family class A member 1; DUSP5, dual specificity
  phosphatase 5; INHBA, inhibin subunit beta A; CXCL8, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand
  8; TRIB1, tribbles pseudokinase 1.
