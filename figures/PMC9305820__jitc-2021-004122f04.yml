caption: 'BA treatment induces distinct gene expression changes and signaling pathway
  activation when compared with the combination therapy. C57BL/6 mice (n=15 per group)
  bearing MC38 tumors were treated intravenously with isotype control (400 µg), anti-PD-L1
  (400 µg), TGF-β trap (492 µg), BA (492 µg), or the combination of anti-PD-L1 and
  TGF-β trap on day 0, day 1, and day 2. Mice were sacrificed on day 6 and RNAseq
  analysis was performed on tumor samples. (A) Venn diagram showing the distribution
  of DEGs in the following comparisons: (1) BA versus isotype control, (2) BA versus
  the combination therapy, and (3) the combination therapy versus isotype control.
  DEGs were defined by genes with expression fold change equal to or greater than
  1.5 and an FDR corrected p value of 0.05 or less based in their log2TPM values.
  72 genes were regulated by BA but not by the combination therapy. (B) Heatmap of
  top DEGs regulated by both BA and combination therapy versus isotype control. Red
  and blue colors represent positive and negative z-score, respectively. A positive
  z-score indicates gene expression higher than the mean expression across all treatment
  groups, while a negative z-score indicates expression lower than the mean value.
  (C) Enrichment plots and gene signature plots of gene sets enriched in MC38 tumor-bearing
  mice treated with BA versus those treated with the combination therapy are presented.
  GSEA identified 297 gene sets that were significantly enriched at FDR <25% and 218
  gene sets that were significantly enriched at a nominal p value of <0.01 with BA.
  The positive NES indicates pathways that were enriched in BA-treated mice. (D) Enrichment
  plots and gene signature plots of gene sets suppressed in MC38 tumor-bearing mice
  treated with BA versus those treated with the combination therapy are presented.
  GSEA identified 143 gene sets were significant at FDR <25% and 140 gene sets were
  significantly enriched at a nominal p value of <0.01 with combination therapy. The
  negative NES indicates pathways that were suppressed by BA versus combination therapy.
  Statistical significance of gene signature scores was examined by one-way ANOVA
  and multiple comparison correction. ANOVA, analysis of variance; BA, bintrafusp
  alfa; DEGs, differentially expressed genes; FDR, False Discovery Rate; GSEA, gene
  set enrichment analysis; NES, normalized enrichment score; PD-L1, programmed death-ligand
  1; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; TPM, transcripts per million.'
