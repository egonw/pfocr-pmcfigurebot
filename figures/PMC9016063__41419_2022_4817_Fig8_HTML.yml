figure_title: METTL3/STEAP2 m6A axis regulates hedgehog signaling pathway and EMT
  in PTC
caption: BCPAP PTC cell lines were transfected with METTL3-overexpression (METTL3)
  plasmids and siRNA targeting STEAP2 (si-STEAP2) as indicated. A, B Effect of METTL3/STEAP2
  axis on the expression of Hedgehog signaling pathway-related proteins (Smo, Gli1,
  and PTCH1) and EMT markers (E-cadherin, N-cadherin, snail, vimentin, and β-catenin)
  in PTC cells were quantified by western blot assay. C The graphic illustration of
  METTL3-mediated m6A modification modulating malignant phenotype of PTC through enhancing
  STEAP2 expression and then restraining Hedgehog signaling pathway and EMT. All data
  are presented as the mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments.
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001.

  thyroid cancer progress by blocking the Hedgehog signaling pathway and epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition.
