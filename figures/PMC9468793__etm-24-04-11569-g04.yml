caption: 'ROS production leads to NLRP3 inflammasome activation-mediated endothelial
  pyroptosis and apoptosis. Mouse pulmonary endothelial cells were exposed to LPS
  (1 µg/ml) in the presence or absence of the ROS scavenger NAC (5 mM) for 6 h. (A)
  Representative protein bands of NLRP3, casp-1(p20) and GSDMD-N. Casp-1(p20) was
  normalized to pro-casp-1, while GSDMD-N was normalized to GSDMD-FL. (B) Representative
  western blot bands of Bax and Bcl-2. (C) Representative TUNEL-positive cells (red);
  nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). Scale bar, 100 µm. Data are expressed
  as the mean ± standard error of the mean (n=4). *P<0.05, **P<0.01 vs. con; ##P<0.01
  vs. LPS. ROS, reactive oxygen species; NLRP3, NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing
  protein 3; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; GSDMD-N, gasdermin D N-terminal fragment; NAC,
  N-acetyl-L-cysteine; FL, full length; Con, control; Cit, citrulline; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; casp, caspase.'

  ROS/NLRP3‑dependent pyroptosis and apoptosis via the Nrf2 signaling pathway.
