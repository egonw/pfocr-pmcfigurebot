caption: Metabolic pathways along the NAFLD spectrum(A) PLS-DA–score plot showing
  metabolic pathway differences across NAFL and NASH (F0-4) patient groups.(B) Predicted
  flux differences across the metabolic subsystems of human hepatocytes at different
  stages of NAFLD. Red and blue colors denotes up- and downregulated fluxes across
  the metabolic subsystems within two different stages of NAFLD. ‘∗∗’ and ‘∗∗∗’ denotes
  statistical signifance (two-sample t-test, p.adj<0.05 and p.adj<0.01 adjusted for
  FDR) respectively. White color denotes “no change”. Flux state at each stage was
  estimated by random sampling.(C) Class-specific AUCs and ROC curves of the PLS-DA
  model.
