caption: KLF14 is expressed at low levels in cervical cancer tissues. A The immunohistochemical
  results showed that the expression level of KLF14 in cervical cancer tissues was
  lower than that in adjacent tissues. B We scored each tissue point (total score = staining
  intensity × positive rate). Quantitative statistics of immunohistochemical results.
