caption: 'Transcriptome analysis of Ex-4TSC versus SC. (A) 1644 mRNAs were determined
  to be statistically differentially expressed (red dots: >2-fold difference, p <
  0.05), of which 479 were significantly upregulated and 1165 significantly downregulated.
  (B) Top 15 individual up- and downregulated DEGs between Ex-4TSC and UC. (C) Top
  5 up- and downregulated canonical pathways identified by IPA. (D) Top 2 canonical
  pathways identified by IPA using up- or downregulated genes and the number of molecules
  involved. The Venn diagramâ€™s upward and downward arrows indicate upregulation and
  downregulation, respectively. The ratio indicates the number of genes in the analyzed
  data over the number of genes known to be involved in the pathway.'
