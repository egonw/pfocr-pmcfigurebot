caption: 'Melatonin could attenuate the downregulation of the MT1, MT2, and SIRT1/Nrf2
  signaling pathways by cisplatin in Leydig cells. (A) Determination of MT1 and MT2
  protein levels was performed by Western blotting in Leydig cells treated with different
  concentrations of melatonin for 24 h. The blots were quantified using Image J software.
  (B) MT1 immunofluorescence in Leydig cells treated with 1 μM of melatonin. MT1 was
  tagged with green fluorescence. The nucleus was labeled with DAPI (scale bar = 20
  μm). (C) MT2 immunofluorescence in Leydig cells treated with 1 μM of melatonin.
  MT1 was tagged with red fluorescence. The nucleus was labeled with DAPI (scale bar
  = 20 μm). (D) Determination of Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 protein levels was performed
  by Western blotting in cisplatin-induced Leydig cells pretreated with different
  concentrations of melatonin or ramelteon. The blots were quantified using Image
  J software. (E) Determination of the SIRT1, SOD1, and SOD2 protein levels was performed
  by Western blotting in cisplatin-induced Leydig cells pretreated with different
  concentrations of melatonin or ramelteon. The blots were quantified using Image
  J software. CP, cisplatin. Mel, melatonin. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM
  (N = 4 per group). * p < 0.05 or ** p < 0.01 compared with controls. # p < 0.05
  compared with CP groups. ∆ p < 0.05 compared with CP groups.'
