caption: Role of OLNZ in 4-HNE immunoreactive cells in the CA1 area of the hippocampus.
  Identification of 4-HNE cells in the sham group (A) 10× and (a) 200×, TI-mediated
  ischemic stroke group (B) 10× and (b) 200×, and TI-mediated ischemic stroke + OLNZ
  (10 mg/kg) group (C) 10× and (c) 200×. (D) The graph signifies the relative numbers
  of immunoreactive 4-HNE cells. Effects of OLNZ on antioxidant enzyme (SOD-2) protein
  expression in hippocampal tissue. The expression of (%) (E) SOD-2 proteins was increased
  after treatment with OLNZ. Data were expressed as the mean ± SEM, n = 3 in each
  group. After performing one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc tests, p < 0.05 for
  comparisons of the treatment groups with the sham group (#) and p < 0.05 for comparisons
  with the TI-induced stroke group (*) were considered significant.
