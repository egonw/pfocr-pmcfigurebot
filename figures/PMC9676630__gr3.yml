caption: 'Silencing of TIAM2 suppresses proliferation, migration, and invasion of
  OS cells. A: Western blot showed TIAM2 protein levels extracted from siTIAM2 and
  the control group in 143B and U2OS cells. B: Quantification of the band density
  ratio of TIAM2 to GAPDH. C, D: Detection of cell proliferation using the CCK-8 assay.
  E-F, H-I: The wound distance of siTIAM2 and the control group (0 h, 24 h, and 48 h)
  determined using wound healing assays. G: The number of migrated cells in the siTIAM2
  and control groups determined using the transwell assay. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.'
article_title: TIAM2 promotes proliferation and invasion of osteosarcoma cells by
  activating the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.
