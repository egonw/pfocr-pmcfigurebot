caption: UC.145 epigenetically regulates DKK1 involved in the canonical Wnt signaling
  pathway. (a) EZH2 ChIP-seq signal identified at the DKK1 genomic locus using the
  CpG island region, EZH2 ChIP-seq peak, and H3K27me3 signal using UCSC Genome Browser;
  (b) RNA immunoprecipitation results determining that EZH2 binds to the DKK1 promoter
  region, confirmed using qRT-PCR. EZH2 targeting siRNA suppressed DKK1 expression
  at the (c) mRNA and (d) protein levels. Altered DKK1 expression was confirmed using
  (e) qRT-PCR and (f) Western blotting. (g) DKK1 methylation was confirmed using MS-PCR.
  (h) Western blotting confirmed that altered EZH2 abundance was caused by inhibition
  of UC.145 expression; (i) ChIP-qPCR analysis of histone modification markers in
  siControl- or siUC.145-transfected cells; (j) Western blotting confirmed changes
  in histone modification markers after treatment with siUC.145s. (k) Changes in DKK1,
  EZH2, and H3K27me3 expression regulated by UC.145 were confirmed by Western blotting
  following treatment with EZH2 inhibitor GSK126. The results in (b–k) were obtained
  in AGS and MKN74 GC cells. Data are shown as mean ± SD of three independent experiments
  (** p ≤ 0.01).
