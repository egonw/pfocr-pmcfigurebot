caption: 'Simplified representation of the biosynthetic pathway of grape flavonoids,
  and relative expression levels of the selected genes (box on the right). The grids
  at the left show the gene expression profiles detected in NA, NT, and SM cultivars,
  as a result of the transcriptomic analysis. Results are mean values (± standard
  deviation) of three biological replicates. Negramaro has been set as a control sample
  (expression level = 1). Asterisks and crosses indicate significant pairwise differences
  between cultivars using Student''s t-test (*,† and **, † † indicates p ≤ 0.05 and
  p ≤ 0.01, respectively). Abbreviations: PAL, Phenilalanine-ammonio-liase; TAL, Thirosin-ammonio-liase;
  C4H, Cinnamato-4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-cumarato-CoA-liase; CHS, Chalcone synthase;
  CHI, Chalcone isomerase; F3H, Flavanone-3-hydroxylase; F3''H, Flavanoid-3''-hydroxylase;
  F3''5''H, Flavanoid-3''5''-hydroxylase; DFR, Di-hydro-flavonol-4-reductase; ANS,
  Leucoanthocyanidin-dioxygenase; OMT, Anthocyanin-O-methyl-transferase; UFGT, UDP-glucose:flavonoid-3-O-glucosyl-transferase;
  5GT, 5-glucosyl-transferase; ANAT, Acyl-transferase; MYBs, MYB transcription factors.'
