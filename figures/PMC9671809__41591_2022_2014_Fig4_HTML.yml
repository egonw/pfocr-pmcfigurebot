figure_title: Genetic associations of plasma metabolites
caption: a, Manhattan plot showing 48 independent mQTLs identified linking 44 metabolites
  and 40 genetic variants with P < 4.2 × 10−11 (Spearman; two sided). Representative
  genes for the SNPs with significant mQTLs are labeled. b, Association between a
  tag SNP (rs1495741) of the NAT2 gene and plasma AFMU levels. c, Association between
  a SNP (rs13100173) within the HYAL3 gene and plasma levels of N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfate.
  d, Association between a tag SNP (rs17789626) of the SCLT1 gene and plasma mizoribine
  levels. e, Differences in coffee intake between participants with different genotypes
  at rs1495741. f, Correlations between coffee intake and AFMU in participants with
  different genotypes at rs1495741. g, Differences in bacterial fatty acid β-oxidation
  pathway abundance in participants with different genotypes at rs67981690. h, Correlations
  between bacterial fatty acid β-oxidation pathway abundance and 5′-carboxy-γ-chromanol
  in participants with different genotypes at rs67981690. In b–e and g, the x axis
  indicates the genotype of the corresponding SNP and the y axis indicates normalized
  residuals of the corresponding metabolic abundance (n = 927 biologically independent
  samples). Each dot represents one sample. The box plots show the median and first
  and third quartiles (25th and 75th percentiles) of the metabolite levels. The upper
  and lower whiskers extend to the largest and smallest value no further than 1.5×
  the IQR, respectively. Outliers are plotted individually. The association strength
  is shown by the Spearman correlation coefficient and corresponding P value (two
  sided). In f and h, the x axis indicates the normalized abundance of coffee intake
  (f) or the bacterial fatty acid β-oxidation pathway (h) and the y axis indicates
  the normalized residuals of the corresponding metabolic abundance. Each dot represents
  one sample (n = 927 biologically independent samples). The lines indicate linear
  regressions for each genotype group separately. Areas with light gray shading indicate
  the 95% CI of the linear regression lines. The association strength per genotype
  is shown by the Spearman correlation and the corresponding P value (two sided).
