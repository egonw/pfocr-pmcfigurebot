caption: Adsorption of miR-19a-3p by LINC00094 sponge in breast cancer. (A) Bioinformatics
  analysis of LINCRNA binding to miR-19a-3p. (B) RT-QPCR was used to detect the expression
  levels of miR-19a-3p (U6 as internal reference) and LINC00094 (Î²-actin as internal
  reference) in plasma of breast cancer patients. (C) Endogenous expression of LINC00094
  in breast cancer cells was detected by RT-QPCR. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001. (D)
  miRNA specific PCR detection of miR-19a-3p expression level (U6 as internal reference).
  **P<0.01, ****P<0.0001. (E) Binding sequence of miR-19a-3p and LINC00094, and mutation
  site of mutant LINC00094. (F) Luciferase activity test of HEK-293T cells in each
  transfection group, ****P<0.0001.
