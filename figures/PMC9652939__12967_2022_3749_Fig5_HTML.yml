caption: MICAL1 promoted WNT pathway by phosphorylating TBC1D1. A, B Silver staining
  (A) and proteomics mass spectrometry analysis (B) of the proteins associated with
  MICAL1. C Endogenous immunoprecipitation assays were conducted to verify the inosculation
  between MICAL1 and TBC1D1. D TBC1D1 and phosphorylated TBC1D1 at Ser660 site were
  detected in indicated PC cells. E, F TOP/FOP flash assays were conducted to evaluate
  the effect of TBC1D1 silencing (E) or Ser660 site phosphorylation of TBC1D1 (F)
  on β-catenin-dependent signaling events. H, I Western blot analysis was conducted
  to evaluate the effect of TBC1D1 silencing (H) or corresponding plasmid transfection
  (I) on key proteins of WNT pathway

  invasion by activating WNT/β-catenin pathway.
