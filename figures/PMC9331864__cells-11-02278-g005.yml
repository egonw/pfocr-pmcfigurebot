caption: The gut microbiota composition and inferred functional content of gut microbiota
  between of control (CON), undernourished (UND), and cotrimoxazole-treated undernourished
  (UND-SXT) C57BL/6 mice. (A) PCoA of Bray–Curtis distances among groups of CON (n
  = 6), UND (n = 7), and SXT (n = 6) C57BL/6 mice. Each point corresponds to a community
  from a single mouse. Colors indicate group identity. Ellipses show the 95% confidence
  intervals. Intra-group differences were evaluated using ADONIS test (p < 0.05);
  (B) heatmap representation of ANCOM-BC analysis showing abundance for the 20 most
  differently significant genus (p < 0.0001) in the gut microbiota of CON (n = 6),
  UND (n = 7), and SXT (n = 6) C57BL/6 mice; (C) LEfSe LDA scores showing significant
  pathway differences between CON (n = 6), UND (n = 7), and UND + SXT (n = 6) C57BL/6
  mice of PICRUSt predicted the relative MetaCyc pathways abundances. Significant
  differences between groups were tested with Kruskal–Wallis test (p < 0.05).
