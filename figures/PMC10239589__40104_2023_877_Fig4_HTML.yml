caption: Effects of DOS and OH-SeMet supplementation on the protein metabolism and
  lipid metabolism in LD. A Relative mRNA expression of UBA1, UBA2, UBE2B, UBE2K,
  ACACA and FASN; B Activity of UBE3; C Protein expression of AKT-mTOR and AMPK-SREBP-1
  signalling pathway; D Activity of ATGL; E Relative protein abundance of p-AKT; F
  Relative protein abundance of p-mTOR; G Relative protein abundance of p-4E-BP1;
  H Relative protein abundance of p-S6K1; I Relative protein abundance of p-AMPKα;
  J Relative protein abundance of SREBP-1. Results were expressed as mean ± SD (n = 6
  or 4), different letters indicate significant differences (P < 0.05)
