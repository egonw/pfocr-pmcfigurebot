caption: Summary of upstream and downstream inhibition of neutrophil extracellular
  trap (NET) formation as tested in preclinical models of cardiovascular disease.
  Upstream inhibitors act by disrupting the NET formation process. These include Cl-amidine
  [,], GSK484 [,,], and YW3-56 [], which inhibit peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PADI4),
  thus preventing histone citrullination and NET release. Inhibitors of the NADPH
  oxidase 2 (Nox2) pathway, such as diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI) [], GSK2795039
  [], and Nox2ds-tat [], block ROS generation and subsequent granule release, which
  is essential for chromatin decondensation. Sivelestat [] and low-molecular weight
  heparin (LMWH) [] target neutrophil elastase (NE) and the release of the granular
  components. Downstream inhibition focuses on the products of formed NETs. DNase
  1 cleaves extracellular DNA, and heparin dismantles NETs and reduces histone-induced
  platelet aggregation. The histone inhibitory peptide HIPe [] binds to the N-terminus
  of histone H4, preventing its lytic interactions with smooth muscle cells.
