caption: The clusters in the disease module for Biliary liver cirrhosis inferred by
  TOPAS(2) using FunCoup. The different node colors correspond to subclusters of the
  resulting disease module. Seed genes have a black border, while the connectors have
  none. The size of the nodes is proportional to the degree of connectivity. Biological
  relevance in terms of Jaccard index (JI) for KEGG pathway term overlap between seeds
  and connectors of the same subcluster is depicted at the bottom of the image as
  circles with colors corresponding to subclusters and numbers depicting the corresponding
  JI. Five out of eight subclusters show a statistically significant overlap at FDR
  < 5%.
