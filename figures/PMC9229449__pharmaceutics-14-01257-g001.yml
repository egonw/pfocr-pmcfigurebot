caption: 'Analysis of cell viability in free and HO-3867-treated U2OS, HOS and MG-63
  cells. (A) The chemical structures of curcumin and curcumin analog HO-3867 were
  drawn; (B) MTT assay was employed to detect the viability of U2OS, HOS, and MG-63
  cells, which were treated with HO-3867 (2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 μM) for 24 h. After
  quantitative analysis, the effects are illustrated. n = 4. U2OS: F = 913.460, p
  < 0.001; HOS: F = 1110.912, p < 0.001; MG-63 (n ≥ 4): F = 880.549, p < 0.001; (C,D)
  CCk-8 assay was employed to detect the viability of U2OS and HOS cells, which were
  treated with HO-3867 (2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 μM) for 24 h. After quantitative analysis,
  the effects are illustrated. U2OS: F = 270.171, p < 0.001; HOS: F = 390.389, p <
  0.001; a p < 0.05, when compared to 0 μM. b p < 0.05, when compared to 2 μM. cp
  < 0.05, when compared to 4 μM. d p < 0.05, when compared to 8 μM. e p < 0.05, when
  compared to 16 μM.'
