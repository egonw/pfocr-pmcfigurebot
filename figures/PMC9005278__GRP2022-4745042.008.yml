caption: Quercetin suppresses inflammation by regulating the AMPK/MAPK/TNF-α signaling
  pathway in PA-induced HepG2 cells. (a) qPCR analyses of TNF-α mRNA levels in HepG2
  cells stimulated by 0.4 mM PA with DMSO or 25 μM quercetin for 24 h (n = 7 − 8).
  (b) Western blot analysis of p-AMPK, AMPK, p-p38, p38, p-ERK, ERK, p-JNK, and JNK
  levels in HepG2 cells stimulated by PA with quercetin (n = 3). (c) Gray value analysis
  of p-AMPK/AMPK, p-p38/p38, p-ERK/ERK, and p-JNK/JNK. Data are presented as the mean
  ± S.E.M. ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01.
