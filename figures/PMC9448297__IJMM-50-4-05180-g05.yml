caption: Inhibition of ferroptosis markedly increases the metastatic capacity of COMM-AD
  cells, and the inhibition of MCT1 and pentose phosphate pathway suppress the metastatic
  capacity of COMM-SUS cells. (A) Schematic diagram of the in vivo experimental design.
  COMM-AD and COMM-SUS cells were tail intravenously injected to 6-week old immunodeficiency
  mice respectively. Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), AZD3965 and 6AN were injected intraperitoneally
  every 2 days for 4 weeks in corresponding group, and the control group was injected
  with PBS. (B) Immunohistochemical staining of Melan-A indicated COMM cells in lung.
  Scale bar, 100.0 Âµm. (C) The frequency of developed lung metastasis of mice shown
  in panel B and in , expressed as a percentage; n=5 mice per group. 6AN, 6-aminonicotinamide;
  COMM, Chinese oral mucosal melanoma; COMM-AD, cells with adhesive morphology; COMM-SUS,
  cells grown in suspension; MCT, monocarboxylate transporter.
