caption: Shikonin induce ovarian cancer cells apoptosis by inducing miR-874-3p/XIAP
  pathway. MiR-874-3p expression was up-regulated by SHK in (A) KURAMOCHI and (B)
  OVSAHO cells. Transfected with 50 nM mimic miR-874 suppressed cell viability in
  (C) KURAMOCHI and (D) OVSAHO cells. (E) TUNEL assay showed the apoptotic KURAMOCHI
  cells after transfected 50 nM mimic miR-874. Knockdown of miR-874-3p reversed the
  cell viability in (F) KURAMOCHI and (G) OVSAHO cells. (H) Protein levels of XIAP
  and Bcl-xL were decreased in SHK-treated and 50 nM mimic miR-874-3p KURAMOCHI cells.
  (I) Protein levels of XIAP were restored by miR-874-3p inhibitor under SHK treatment
  in KURAMOCHI cells. *P < 0.05.
