caption: Differential metabolic analysis in response to insect damage. (A) Volcano
  diagram of the differential metabolites of Type A and Type C. (B) Numbers of the
  differential metabolites of Type A and Type C under positive and negative modes.
  (C) Volcano diagram of the differential metabolites of Type B and Type C. (D) Numbers
  of the differential metabolites of Type B and Type C under positive and negative
  modes. (E) Pathway impact diagram. The bubble size represents the number of different
  metabolites involved in this pathway, and the bubble color represents the p-value
  of this metabolic pathway.
