caption: 'Resveratrol suppresses serum-induced invasion in prostate cancer cells.
  PC-3 (A) or DU145 cells (B) with RES seeded on a matrigel-coated up chamber of transwell
  and serum was filled in a down chamber. After a 24 h-incubation, the cells were
  fixed and stained. The images were taken with an inverted microscope at 200 × magnification.
  Scale bar = 100 μm. The number of invading cells was counted and expressed as a
  percentage of the untreated control group. Data present as the mean ± SD of three
  independent experiments by analysis of Student’s t-test. *** p < 0.001 versus untreated
  control; ##p < 0.01 and ###p < 0.001 versus serum-treated control.'
article_title: Resveratrol suppresses serum-induced vasculogenic mimicry through impairing
  the EphA2/twist-VE-cadherin/AKT pathway in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells.
