caption: 'Inhibition of T-cell proliferation, activation and differentiation by itolizumab.
  Cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from healthy donors
  (HD) and patients before or after acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) onset
  were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD2/CD28 beads in the presence of itolizumab or isotype
  control (cetuximab). (A) Proliferation of CD4 and CD8 T cells measured by CFSE dye
  dilution; (B) Activation of CD4 and CD8 T cells measured by expression of CD25;
  (C) maturation of CD4 and CD8 T cells measured by expression of CD45RO; (D) ALCAM
  expression is absent in resting T cells and is an additional marker of T-cell activation.
  (E) Percent inhibition induced by itolizumab, comparing activity against HD, pre-
  and postGvHD samples in CD4 and CD8 T cells. Percentage inhibition was calculated
  using the following formula: (% cells in isotype control - % cells in itolizumab)/%
  cells in isotype control. If no difference was observed between isotype control
  and itolizumab the percentage of itolizumab inhibition equals 0%. Statistically
  significant differences are noted: **P<0.01; *P<0.05; Wilcoxon rank-sum test. HD
  n=9, preGvHD n=7, postGvHD n=8.'
