figure_title: Specificity of anti-uPAR-QD internalization by uPAR-expressing breast
  cancer cells
caption: Confocal images of live MDA-MB-231 cells incubated with (A-C) scFv-QD conjugates
  (610 nm emission peak) for 60 min at 37 °C or (D-F) SpyCatcher-QD conjugates without
  scFv Ab. (A,D) AlexaFluor 488-WGA fluorescence of the plasma membrane and endolysosomal
  pathway; (B,E) QD emission with or without surface anti-uPAR scFv. (C,F) Overlay
  of WGA and anti-uPAR-QD emission. QDs were excited at 405 nm and emission collected
  from 605 – 690 nm. AlexaFluor488 was excited at 488 nm and emission collected from
  495 – 575 nm. Scale bar is 30 μm.
