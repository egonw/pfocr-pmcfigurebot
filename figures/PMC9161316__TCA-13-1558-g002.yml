caption: Workflow of necessary steps in current study. Patients were enrolled as the
  recruitment pathway. Tumors are semi‐automatically segmented on axial arterial phase
  CT. Radiomic features are extracted from corresponding VOIs on CT images. Feature
  was selected by inter‐ and intra‐observer reliability assessment and subsequent
  least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. The radiomics signature
  is constructed by a linear combination of selected features. The performance of
  the prediction model is assessed by C‐index and the calibration curve. A nomogram
  is built for individualized assessment, decision curve analysis, and survival prediction
  are then performed
