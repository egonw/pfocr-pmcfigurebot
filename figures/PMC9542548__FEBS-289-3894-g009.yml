caption: Iron homeostasis signalling pathway showing proteins identified by ≥ 2 unique
  peptides and fold change ≥ 20%, mapped by IPA. Green nodes represent downregulated
  proteins, red nodes represent upregulated proteins, grey nodes represent proteins
  that were identified in the proteomics dataset but whose expression levels were
  not significantly altered by a fold change ≥ 20%, and white nodes represent proteins
  or groups/families of molecules that were either not present or sufficiently represented
  (respectively) in the proteomics dataset. Solid lines represent direct interactions
  and dotted lines represent indirect interactions. Double circle represents a family
  of proteins. FXN, Frataxin; HGB, Haemoglobin; NUBP1, nucleotide binding protein
  1.
