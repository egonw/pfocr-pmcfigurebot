caption: MSC-CM enhances tumor progression via the activation of the ERK/c-Fos signaling
  axis.A, the MS/MS spectrum of the phosphopeptide from c-Fos. The fragment ions in
  the MS2 spectrum localized at the phosphorylation site to serine 374. B, the consensus
  motifs of ERK1/2 (P-X-S/T-P) matched the sequence near the serine 374 site of c-Fos.
  C and D, the levels of ERK1/2 and phospho-ERK1/2-T202/Y204 were measured using Western
  blotting. Relative expression levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in cells stimulated
  with Control-CM or MSC-CM were normalized according to the level of total ERK1/2
  and the loading control (GAPDH). E and F, the quantified results of Western blotting
  from three biological replicates are displayed as dot plots. G and H, cell proliferation
  (G) and cell migration (H) were detected in the lung cancer cells treated with or
  without MSC-CM in the presence or absence of ERK1/2 inhibitor (SCH772984). All quantified
  results are shown as mean ± standard deviation. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001,
  two-tailed t test. CM, conditioned medium; ERK1/2, extracellular signal–regulated
  protein kinases 1 and 2; MSC, mesenchymalstem cell.
