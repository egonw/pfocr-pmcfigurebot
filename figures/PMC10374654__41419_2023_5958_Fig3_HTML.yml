figure_title: RNA sequencing data show the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway
  in c-MET/sgp53 HCCs
caption: A Genetic dissimilarity among the samples in c-MET/sgp53 HCCs and normal
  liver as demonstrated by the heatmap. B KEGG analysis of upregulated DEGs in the
  c-MET/sgp53 HCCs as compared to normal livers. C KEGG analysis of overlapping up-regulated
  DEGs in c-MET/sgp53 HCCs and c-MET-high/TP53-null human HCCs. NL normal livers,
  ST surrounding tissues, DEG differentially expressed genes.
