caption: SARS‐CoV‐2 ORF10 suppresses IFN production induced by the cGAS–STING signaling
  pathway. (A) Identification of SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins perturbing STING‐induced IFN‐β
  activation. HEK293T cells were transfected with empty vector (E.V.) or STING expression
  vectors in the presence or absence of various SARS‐CoV‐2 protein expression vectors
  as indicated; 36 h later, the cells were harvested for total RNA extraction and
  subsequent RT‐qPCR examination of IFN‐β mRNA level. (B) SARS‐CoV‐2 ORF10 inhibits
  the expression of IFN‐β, IFN‐λ1, CXCL10, and ISG56 induced by the cGAS–STING signaling
  pathway. HEK293T cells were transfected with protein expression vectors as indicated.
  Thirty‐six hours posttransfection, total RNA was isolated and used to analyze the
  transcriptional level of the indicated genes by RT‐qPCR. (C) SARS‐CoV‐2 ORF10 inhibits
  STING‐induced activation of IFN‐β, IFN‐λ1, or ISG luciferase reporters. Luciferase
  reporter plasmids of IFN‐β (IFN‐β‐Luc), IFN‐λ1 (IFN‐λ1‐Luc), or ISGs (ISRE‐Luc)
  were cotransfected with STING‐ and/or ORF10‐expressing plasmids into HEK293T cells.
  pRL‐TK Renilla was transfected as an internal control. Thirty‐six hours later, transactivation
  of the luciferase reporters was determined using dual‐luciferase reporter assays.
  (D) SARS‐CoV‐2 ORF10 inhibits STING‐induced IFN‐β production in A549 cells. Protein
  expression plasmids were transfected into A549 cells as indicated. Thirty‐six hours
  later, A549 cells were harvested and subjected to RNA isolation and RT‐qPCR analysis
  of IFN‐β expression. (E) SARS‐CoV‐2 ORF10 inhibits IFN‐β expression induced by SARS‐CoV‐2
  trVLP infection. HK‐2 cells were transfected with ORF10 expression plasmid, 36 h
  later, the cells were infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 trVLP for 12 h and then the cells
  were harvested for RNA isolation and RT‐qPCR analysis. (F, G) SARS‐CoV‐2 ORF10 inhibits
  IFN‐β expression and secretion in HK‐2 cells. ORF10 expression plasmid was transfected
  into HK‐2 cells, 36 h posttransfection, HSV‐1‐∆ICP0 was used to infect the cells
  as indicated, 12 h postinfection, the cells and culture supernatant were harvested
  for RT‐qPCR and ELISA analysis, respectively. cGAS, cyclic GMP–AMP synthase; ELISA,
  enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay; HSV, herpes simplex virus type 1; IFN, interferon;
  ISG, IFN‐stimulated gene; mRNA, messenger RNA; NSP, nonstructural protein; ORF10,
  open reading frame 10; RT‐qPCR, real‐time quantitative polymerase chain reaction;
  SARS‐CoV‐2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; trVLP, transcription‐
  and replication‐competent virus‐like particle. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; and ***p < 0.001.
