caption: Effects of combination of Pentamidine and LY294002 on Ishikawa cell proliferation.
  A Ishikawa cells were treated with vehicle, LY294002 or LY294002 combined Pentamidine
  for 24 h. Protein levels of AKT and p-AKT were analyzed by Western blotting. GAPDH
  was used as the loading control. B The ratio of p-AKT/AKT was quantified by densitometry.
  Data are represented as mean ± standard deviation from three independent experiments.
  *P < 0.05. GAPDH was used as the loading control. C Ishikawa cells were treated
  with vehicle, LY294002 or LY294002 combined Pentamidine for 24 h. And then cell
  viability was determined by MTS assay. Statistical analysis was performed between
  cells treated with vehicle and each of the other drug groups. Data are represented
  as mean ± standard deviation from three independent experiments. P value refers
  to one-way ANOVA. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01
