caption: PeptibodyC19 binds FGFR1 and is internalized into FGFR1-expressing cells.
  (A) PeptibodyC19 was expressed in CHO cells and purified by ProteinA-affinity chromatography.
  Protein levels during the purification process were detected by western blot analysis
  with anti-Fc antibodies. The additional band visible on the western blot results
  from the presence of the peptibody dimer, due to the possibly incomplete sample
  reduction before electrophoresis. (B) Proper mass of purified protein was confirmed
  by mass spectrometry. (C) Kinetics of peptibodyC19 binding to FGFR1 measured by
  SPR. Titration with the peptibody in the concentration range from 20 to 320 nM allowed
  determination of Kd (87.7 nM), kon (5.55 × 104 s–1 M–1), and koff (4.87 × 10–3 s–1)
  values. (D) Western blot analysis of signaling pathway activation by peptibodyC19.
  Ctrl – untreated cells. Antibodies against both phosphorylated and total FGFR1 and
  Erk1,2 were utilized. Anti-tubulin antibodies were used for loading control. (E)
  Internalization of peptibodyC19 into FGFR1-expressing cells evaluated with fluorescence
  microscopy. The Fc domain alone was used as a negative control. Fc-bearing proteins
  were labeled with ZenonAF 488. Early endosomes and nucleus were visualized by Rab5a
  RFP fusion and DAPI staining, respectively. The scale bar corresponds to 5 μm.
