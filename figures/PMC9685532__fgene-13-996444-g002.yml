caption: Exploration of two different expression patterns of pyroptosis-related molecules.
  (A) Heatmap depicts the association between pyroptosis-related genes expression
  levels and essential cancer signaling pathways. The percentage is the total proportion
  of tumors in which a gene has an influence on the pathway among the 32 cancer types
  (number of inhibited or activated cancer types/32 *100%). Pyroptosis genes that
  have a role (inhibit or activate) in at least five cancer types are included in
  this heatmap. The percentage of tumors in which a pathway may be inhibited by specified
  genes is represented by “pathway inhibit” (blue), whereas activation is represented
  by “pathway activate” (red). (B) The correlation between the pyroptosis-related
  genes in LUSC and essential cancer signaling pathways. The dotted line indicates
  inhibition, whereas the solid line indicates activation. (C) t-SNE plot shows two
  different pyroptosis expression patterns represented by the expression of pyroptosis-related
  genes. (D) Kaplan-Meier curves for the OS between two distinct pyroptosis expression
  patterns. (E) Univariate Cox analysis to explore the prognosis value of each pyroptosis-related
  genes for LUSC.
