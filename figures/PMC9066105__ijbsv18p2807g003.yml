caption: BMI1-ChIP-Seq Analysis. (A) Circos plot of public BMI1 ChIP-seq data. From
  the outside-in, the tracks represent chromosome karyotypes, peak distributions for
  the BMI1 group (purple), peak distributions for the IgG control group (blue), ratios
  of peak comparisons (the red or green color indicates higher or lower abundance
  in the BMI1 group) and the relative locations of annotated genes (orange). (B) Distribution
  of BMI1-binding sites relative to TSS of genes. (C) Representative KEGG pathway
  for BMI1's putative direct targets within 1 kb of their TSS. (D) Visualization of
  (C) based on Cytoscape Software. (E) Protein-protein association network involved
  in 'signaling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells' set of pathways was
  analyzed using the STRING database. (F) BMI1 binding peaks at the indicated gene
  loci. (G) ChIP-qPCR of BMI1 target genes in SSCs using an anti-BMI1 antibody. Data
  represent mean ± SD, n = 3 independently differentiated groups. Statistical analysis
  was performed using Student's two tailed t test. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
  not significant (n.s.), P > 0.05.
