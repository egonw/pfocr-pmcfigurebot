caption: 'SPI1 regulated NMT1 to mediate GC cell migration and invasion. (a) Migration
  rate of AGS cells at 48 h was evaluated through wound healing assay after transfection
  of NMT1 overexpression plasmid and shSPI1. (b) Migration rate of SNU-5 cells at
  48 h was evaluated through wound healing assay after transfection of shNMT1 and
  SPI1 overexpression plasmid. (c) Invasion rate of AGS cells at 48 h was determined
  by Transwell assay after transfection of NMT1 overexpression plasmid and shSPI1.
  (d) Invasion rate of SNU-5 cells at 48 h was determined by Transwell assay after
  transfection of shNMT1 and SPI1 overexpression plasmid. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗∗p < 0.001
  vs. NC + shNC group; ∧∧∧p < 0.001 vs. NMT1+shNC group; ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001
  vs. NC + shSPI1 group; +++p < 0.001 vs. shNMT1+NC group; △△△p < 0.001 vs. shNC + SPI1
  group. All experiments were repeated independently at least three times. Data were
  performed as the means ± standard deviation. NMT1, N-myristoyltransferase 1; GC,
  gastric cancer; shNMT1, short hairpin RNA against NMT1; NC, negative control; shNC,
  shRNA negative control.'
