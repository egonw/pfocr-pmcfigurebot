caption: 'The potential of mRNA bridge mimetics in therapeutic applications. (A and
  B) The CRISPR Self Check-In targeting EZH2 decreased human A549 cell viability after
  72 h of transfection in vitro. The cell viability was decreased through inhibition
  of the ERK signaling pathway by EZH2 knock-out. (C) T7E1 analysis shows the controlled
  genome editing by CRISPR Self Check-In in vitro. Indel frequency was measured by
  Targeted Deep Sequencing. (D and E) The decreased tumorigenic potential via selective
  gene editing was confirmed at 28 days after the inoculation of A549 cells transfected
  by CRISPR Self Check-In targeting EZH2 in vivo. (F) WB for EZH2 knockout by CRISPR
  Self Check-In in vivo shown in D and E (G) Increase of miR-21 expression by cisplatin
  treatment (10 μM) in A549 cells. (H) Increase of EZH2 expression by cisplatin treatment
  (10 μM) in A549 cells. (I) Combinatorial treatment of cisplatin (10 μM) and CRISPR
  Self Check-In targeting EZH2 enhances anti-cancer efficacy in A549 cells after 72
  h of transfection in vitro. (J and K) Combinatorial treatment of cisplatin with
  CRISPR Self Check-In targeting EZH2 after 2 weeks of A549 inoculation into the mouse
  increases anti-tumour efficacy in vivo. (L) WB for EZH2 knockout by CRISPR Self
  Check-In in vivo shown in J and K (M and N) Decrease of enhanced EZH2 expression
  induced by cisplatin with CRISPR Self Check-In treatment in vivo shown by immunohistochemistry.
  Bars indicated 200 μm. (O and P) Immunofluorescence staining of EZH2. Green: EZH2,
  Blue: DAPI. Bars indicated 100 μm. All experiments in the present study were performed
  in triplicate. Error bars represent SD over biological replicates. P values were
  obtained using One-way ANOVA. ns; no statistical significance, *P < 0.05, **P <
