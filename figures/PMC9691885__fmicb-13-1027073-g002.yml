caption: The determinants regulating bradyzoite development and reactivation. After
  T. gondii infection, host microenvironment adjustments (immune response and metabolite
  supply) are associated with tachyzoite-bradyzoite interconversion. The IL-12/IFN-γ
  pathway is an effective strategy primarily used to control T. gondii infection in
  immunocompetent hosts. Despite this, some tachyzoites escape immune destruction
  and differentiate into bradyzoites. In chronically infected mice (weeks postinfection
  >7) or T. gondii-infected AIDS patients, the host CD4+ T cell impairment that is
  regulated by Blimp-1 enhances PD-1/PDL-1-mediated CD8+ T cell exhaustion, resulting
  in bradyzoite reactivation. The host metabolites also directly impact T. gondii
  differentiation under nutrient-deprived conditions (deprivation of arginine, pyrimidine,
  etc.) or nutrient-replete conditions (exogenous addition of adenosine and lactate).
  In addition, T. gondii relies on various strategies to optimize its persistence,
  including the transcriptional activation or repression by TgAP2 factors and other
  effectors (PKAc3, PI1, etc.), the translational control via TgIF2K-A/TgIF2K-B-dependent
  eIF2α phosphorylation, GCN5a-mediated post-translational modifications (PTMs), and
  the biogenesis of the cyst wall and cyst matrix. Moreover, the development of 2D
  tissue culture systems with human myotubes and primary brain cells promote cyst
  maturation, and emerging 3D system with human brain organoids can present the natural
  cellular structure of T. gondii life cycle stages. These new in vitro models help
  elucidate the mechanisms of T. gondii stage conversion. The left side of the dotted
  line represents the determinants regulating bradyzoite differentiation. On the other
  hand, the factors contributing to bradyzoite reactivation are documented.
