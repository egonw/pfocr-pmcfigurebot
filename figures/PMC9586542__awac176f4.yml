caption: Serum lipid profiles discriminate LRRK2 G2019S carriers from non-LRRK2 G2019S
  carriers in the LRRK2 Ashkenazi Jewish Cohort. Multivariate ANOVA covarying for
  age and sex identified four principal components, (A) PC41, (B) PC57, (C) PC63 and
  (D) PC73, that were significantly different between the LRRK2 mutation and non-mutation
  groups. (E–H) The top 20 lipid species that contributed to the top four components
  which significantly distinguished between LRRK2 mutation and non-mutation groups.
  The dashed red line represents the expected value if the contribution of lipids
  were uniform. n = 315. WT = wild-type.
