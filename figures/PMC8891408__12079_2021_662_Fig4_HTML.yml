caption: 'CaSR activates mTORC2 in MDA-MB-231 cells. (A) Hypothetical model of CaSR
  signaling to mTORC2 and downstream kinases. (B) Effect of CaSR stimulation on AKT
  phosphorylation in MDA-MB-231 cells. Bars represent mean ± standard deviation (SD),
  * p = 0.0118; (one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey; n = 3). (C) NPS-2143 calcilytic
  prevents CaSR-dependent phosphorylation of AKT in MDA-MB231 cells. Bars represent
  mean ± SD, *p = 0.0127, & p = 0.0127, ##p = 0.0033, ###p = 0.0004; (one-way ANOVA
  followed by uncorrected Fisher; n = 3). (D) Effect of Gallein on AKT phosphorylation
  stimulated by R568 + calcium. Bars indicate mean ± SD, **p = 0.0022, #p = 0.0198;
  (unpaired Student t test; n = 3). (E) Effect of wortmannin (Wm) on AKT phosphorylation
  in MDA-MB-231 cells. Bars indicate mean ± SD, *p < 0.05, ## p = 0.007; (one-way
  ANOVA followed by Bonferroni; n = 3). (F) Effect of rapamycin on CaSR-induced AKT
  and PKC phosphorylation. MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated for 24 h with rapamycin
  before stimulation with R568 + calcium for 5 or 10 min. Cell lysates were analyzed
  by western blot to detect AKT and PKC phosphorylation. Bars represent mean ± SD,
  **p < 0.01, #p < 0.05; (one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni; n = 3)'
