caption: Therapeutic targets in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Antiviral drugs target the essential
  steps for viral infection. ACE2 blockers, TMPRSS2 inhibitor, and neutralizing antibodies
  disrupt the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 and other protein acceptors. Chloroquine
  and Hydroxychloroquine suppress the endocytosis process. Remdesivir, Molnupiravir
  and Paxlovid inhibit viral replication. JAK-STAT signaling pathway inhibitors, corticosteroids,
  and recombinant agonists and antagonists of cytokines and interferons serve as immunosuppressants
  to modulate the cytokine storm induced by the hyper-activation of the immune system.
