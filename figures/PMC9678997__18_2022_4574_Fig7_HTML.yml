caption: 'LRRK2 down-regulates PINK1 protein level via facilitation of PINK1 protein
  degradation in an LRRK2 kinase activity-dependent manner. A–C LRRK2 KO up-regulates
  PINK1 protein level in human HAP1 cells. A Representative Western blot data of PINK1
  levels in LRRK2 KO HAP1 cells. B Densitometric analysis of red arrowhead-pointed
  PINK1 bands in Western blot gels in A. *, P < 0.01, compared with the arbitrary
  value of PINK1 bands in control HAP1 cells. C LRRK2 KO has no influence on PINK1
  transcription level in HAP1 cells, demonstrated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR
  analysis. *P < 0.001, compared with the expression level of PINK1 in control HAP1
  cells. D–F Stable transfection of WT and mutant G2019S LRRK2 down-regulates PINK1
  protein level in SH-SY5Y cells. D Western blot data of PINK1 bands in empty vector,
  WT or mutant G2019S LRRK2 stably transfected cells. E Densitometric analysis of
  red arrowhead-pointed PINK1 bands in Western blot gels in D. *, P < 0.001, compared
  with the arbitrary value of PINK1 bands in empty vector transfected cells. F Quantitative
  real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that stable transfection of WT and mutant G2019S
  LRRK2 had no impact on PINK1 transcription level in cells. *P < 0.001, compared
  with LRRK2 transcription level of empty vector transfected cells. G–J Human WT and
  mutant G2019S LRRK2 down-regulate PINK1 protein level in LRRK2/PINK1 double TG Drosophila
  heads. Single or double TG LRRK2 and/or PINK1 lines are crossed with ddc-GAL4 line
  to induce expressions of PINK1 and or LRRK2 in DA neurons in Drosophila heads. Drosophila
  heads are harvested after 3 days culture, homogenized and subjected to Western blot
  analysis of PINK1 protein level. G–I Representative Western blot data of PINK1 level
  in Drosophila heads of control, WT or G309D PINK1, WT or mutant G2019S LRRK2 single
  or double TG Drosophila. G WT PINK1 and/or WT or mutant G2019S LRRK2; H mutant G309D
  PINK1 and/or mutant G2019S LRRK2 Drosophila. I Mutant G309D PINK1 and or WT LRRK2
  Drosophila. J Densitometric analysis of red arrowhead-pointed PINK1 protein bands
  in Western blot gels in G, H and I. *, at least P < 0.05, compared with the arbitrary
  value of PINK1 bands in single WT or mutant G309D PINK1 TG Drosophila. K and L Mutant
  G2019S LRRK2 down-regulates PINK1 protein level in iPSc derived hMLOs. K Western
  blot data of PINK1 levels in hMLOs with mutant G2019S LRRK2 after 60 days induction
  and culture. L Densitometric analysis of red arrowhead-pointed PINK1 bands in Western
  blot gels in J. *, P < 0.05, compared with the arbitrary value of PINK1 bands of
  hMLOs with WT LRRK2. M and N, mutant G2019S LRRK2 down-regulates PINK1 protein level
  in iPSc derived human DA neurons. M Western blot data of modulated PINK1 levels
  in human DA neurons with mutant G2019S LRRK2 after 42 days induction and culture.
  N Densitometric analysis of red arrow head pointed PINK1 bands in Western blot gels
  in L. *P < 0.0001, compared with the arbitrary value of PINK1 protein bands of human
  DA neurons with WT LRRK2. O and P Mutant G2019S LRRK2 down-regulates PINK1 protein
  level in mutant G2019S LRRK2 TG mice cortex. O Representative Western blot data
  of modulated PINK1 protein levels in 6 month aged TG mice cortex by mutant G2019S
  LRRK2. P Densitometric analysis of red arrow head pointed PINK1 bands in Western
  blot gels in O. *P < 0.001, compared with the arbitrary value of PINK1 protein bands
  of control non-transgenic mice. Q–R Mutant G2019S LRRK2 promotes proteasome degradation
  of PINK1 protein in SH-SY5Y cells. Q Representative Western blot data of PINK1 levels
  in empty vector or mutant G2019S LRRK stably transfected cells in the presence or
  absence of 3 µM proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 6 h. R Densitometric analysis of
  red arrowhead-pointed PINK1 bands in Western blot gels in Q. *, at least P < 0.001,
  compared with the arbitrary value of PINK1 bands of respective cells without MG132
  treatment. #, at least P < 0.001, compared with the arbitrary value of PINK1 bands
  of empty vector transfected cells with or without MG132 treatment, respectively'
