caption: SQLE is highly expressed in BCa tissues and SQLE expression is associated
  with various clinical characters. (A) The mRNA expression levels of SQLE in 33 types
  of tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues from the TIMER database; (B) The differential
  expression of SQLE between unpaired BCa tissues and adjacent normal tissues. The
  nucleus is blue and the brownish-yellow stain is positive; the darker the color,
  the higher the level of gene expression; (C) The differential mRNA expression of
  SQLE between bladder tumor tissue and adjacent normal tissue in BCa; (D) Representative
  immunohistochemistry of SQLE in BCa tissues and adjacent tissues. The nucleus is
  blue and the brownish-yellow stain is positive; the darker the color, the higher
  the level of gene expression; (E) The landscape of SQLE-related clinicopathological
  features of BCa in TCGA database; (F) The landscape of SQLE-related clinicopathological
  features of BCa in the GEO database; (G–J) The correlation between the expression
  of SQLE and some clinicopathological features of BCa. (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***
