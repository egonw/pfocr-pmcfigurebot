caption: Cytotoxic effects of butein in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts. An MTT assay was performed
  to measure the cell viability. The cells were treated with various concentrations
  of butein (0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 10 µM) for 24 (a), 48 (b), and 72 h (c). The results
  are shown as the mean ± SEM in triplicate. Cont; control, Bu; butein.
