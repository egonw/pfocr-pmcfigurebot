caption: Effect of genistein (GS) on NF-κB signaling in proximal tubular cells treated
  with IL-1β. (A) Effect of genistein on the NF-κB pathway. NRK-52E cells were treated
  with IL-1β (10 ng/mL) or genistein (50 μM). After 2 h, p65 protein levels were analyzed
  by Western blotting. β-Actin served as the loading control, and lamin served as
  the nuclear separation control. (B,C) Statistical analysis of A (n = 3). Data are
  shown relative to the value in the IL-1β treatment group. * p < 0.05 vs. IL-1β treatment
  group.
