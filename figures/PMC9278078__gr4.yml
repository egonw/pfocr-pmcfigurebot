caption: PLGA/MgO/Que increased osteogenesis via Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
  (A) Proper concentration of PLGA/MgO/Que increased the expression of osteogenesis
  associated genes including RUNX2, ALP, BMP2, COL1A1 and OPN in BMSCs; (B) in BMSCs,
  the expression of collagen I and Runx2 increased in Que membranes immersing medium;
  (C) Alizarin Red stain and ALP Stain showed Que could promote osteogenesis in 0.1%
  concentration; (D) cultured in membranes immersing extracts, Que increasing the
  expression of Collagen I and OPN, the scale is 20 ​μm (left) and 50 ​μm (right);
  (E) Statistical analysis of fluorescence intensity of Collagen I (left) and OPN
  (right); (F) and (G) 0.1% Que immersing medium increased the expression of Wnt3a
  and non-phospho catenin in BMSCs; ∗p ​< ​0.05, ∗∗p ​< ​0.01, ∗∗∗p ​< ​0.001, ∗∗∗∗p ​< ​0.0001.
