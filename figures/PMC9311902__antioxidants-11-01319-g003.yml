caption: Comprehensive amino acid and organic acid biosynthesis pathway. The blue
  color compounds represent amino acids whereas the red color compounds represent
  organic acids that were identified by LCâ€“MS/MS method in sugarcane rinds. All the
  colored compounds are identified in this study in sugarcane rind whereas the black
  colored compounds are shown only for describing the sequence and better understanding
  of metabolic pathway. Dotted lines indicate several enzymatic steps whereas plain
  lines indicate single steps. The light green, purple, and pink color signify the
  three major organic acid and amino acid biosynthesis pathways. KEGG plant metabolism
  (https://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html#metabolism; accessed on 25 November 2021)
  was used to construct this pathway.
