caption: (A) Key cellular events of organ fibrosis. Organ damage can trigger infiltration
  of immune cells, followed by secretion of excessive cytokines/chemokines to activate
  myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts are originated from many cell types, such as epithelial
  cells, mesothelial cells and endothelial cells, through EMT, MMT or EndoMT. Activated
  myofibroblasts promote organ ECM synthesis/deposition. (B) Key signaling pathway
  of organ fibrosis. TGF-β participates in the molecular mechanism of fibrosis in
  Smad-dependent and Smad-independent manner such as MAPK families. Moreover, TGF-β
  also interacts with other profibrotic pathways, such as the Wnt/β-catenin, Hedgehog
  and BMP-7 pathways. (TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; ILs, interleukins; PDGF,
  platelet-derived growth factor; EMT, epithelial to mesenchymal transition; MMT,
  mesothelial to mesenchymal transition; EndoMT, endothelial to mesenchymal transition;
  MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; TIMPs, tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases;
  PA, plasminogen activator; PAI, plasminogen activator-inhibitor 1; MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; JNK, JUN amino-terminal kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β; FN, fibronectin).
