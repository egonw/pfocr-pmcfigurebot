caption: 'ICM- and TE-enhanced heatmap depicting IPA upstream regulators for ICM-
  and TE-enhanced genes, limited to those with significance in all four species in
  full method. Figure consists of two panels: ICM-enhanced (A) and TE-enhanced (B),
  with two columns for the full and homology methods. Along the top x-axis, each column
  is further divided by dataset for three species: human, mouse, and cow. Along the
  y-axis are the identified biological functions. Level of significant overlap was
  set at P < 0.05; entries with white color denote those not meeting significance.
  Green circles denote those upstream regulators that are also ICM-enhanced. As described
  in methods, the identification of DEGs in the full method but not the homology method
  does not cast doubt on the validity of the DEG call; differences arise due to genes
  falling below the MetaPhOrs consistency score or impact in changes in normalization
  using the homology method. Data generated from Supplemental Tables S19 and S20.
  DEG, differentially expressed gene; ICM, inner cell mass; IPA, Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis; TE, trophectoderm.'
