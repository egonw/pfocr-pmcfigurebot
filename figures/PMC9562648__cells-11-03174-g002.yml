caption: 'VDAC1 mediates apoptosis and mtDNA release to promote cytokines expression
  and inflammatory pathogenesis. (A) Bcl-2 family member, BAX, interacts with VDAC1
  to release cytochrome c into the cytoplasm, promoting apoptosis. (B) MOMP induces
  proteasomal degradation of IAPs, which causes NIK to further induce the pro-inflammatory
  NF-κB signal and activate caspase-1/8; this in turn results in the maturation of
  pro-inflammatory factor IL-1β. (C) Mitochondrial overproduced ROS oxidize mtDNA
  to fomtDNA. The mtDNA and fomtDNA pass the VDAC1 oligomers channel or the oligomerization
  BAX pore into the cytoplasm. The released mtDNA/fomtDNA induce the cGAS-STING pathway
  to promote interferon gene expressions via TBK1-IRF3 to up-regulate IFN-α/β, or
  through TBK1-NF-κB to enhance TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-12. Additionally, mtDNA interacts
  with TLR9 and promotes TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-12 expression via NF-κB signaling. Moreover,
  the released mtDNA induces the NLRP3 inflammasome and AIM2 inflammasome to enhance
  caspase-1/8 activation to promote IL-1β/IL-18 maturation. Abbreviations: AIM2: absent

  mitochondrial membrane; MOMP: mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization; mtDNA:
  mitochondrial DNA; NF-κB: nuclear factor-κB; NIK: NF-κB induced kinase; NLRP3: nucleotide-binding
  domain and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) containing P3; ROS: reactive oxygen species;
