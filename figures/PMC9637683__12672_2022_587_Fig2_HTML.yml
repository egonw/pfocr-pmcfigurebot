caption: KLF13 induced cell arrest and inhibited proliferation of gastric cancer in
  vitro. A, B KEGG pathway and GO_BP analyses of genes that interact directly or indirectly
  with KLF13. C Western blot was conducted to detect the efficiency of KLF13 overexpression
  in gastric cancer cell lines. D Colony formation assay was performed to investigate
  the effect of KLF13 on cell proliferation. E Cell viabilities at the indicated time
  points were shown using CCK-8. F Cell cycle distribution was analyzed through flow
  cytometry analysis using Propidium Iodide (PI) dye. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01
article_title: Kruppel-like factor 13 inhibits cell proliferation of gastric cancer
  by inducing autophagic degradation of β-catenin.
