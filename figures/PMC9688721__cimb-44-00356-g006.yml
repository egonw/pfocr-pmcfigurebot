caption: Influence of quercetin on the TLR4 signalling system in LPS-induced BIECs.
  BIECs were treated with 80 μg/mL quercetin in an environment of 5 μg/mL LPS for
  6 h. The mRNA expressions of TLR4, TLR2, MD2, CD14, MyD88, IRF3 and NF-κB in BIECs
  were tested by qRT-PCR. The results are mean ± SEM (n = 6). Various lowercase letters
  in the line graph demonstrate significant changes (p < 0.05).
