caption: BDX-01 regulated proinflammatory cytokine production and suppressed the NLRP3
  inflammasome signaling pathway. (A) mRNA levels of Il-1β, Tnf-α, Il-6, Il-10, Nlrp3,
  and Caspase-1 in colon tissues were determined using qRT-PCR. (B) NF-κB, NLRP3,
  ASC, caspase-1, gsdmd, and IL-1β expression levels in the DSS group were determined
  using western blotting analysis. Data represent the means ± SD (n = 3). *p < 0.05;
  **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001 (unpaired t-test, Kruskal–Wallis test,
  and one-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc test).
