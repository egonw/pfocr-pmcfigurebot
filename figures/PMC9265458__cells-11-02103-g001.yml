caption: Inhibition of mTOR signaling increases spacing of slit diaphragms in Drosophila
  nephrocytes. (A) Simplified representation of the mTOR and autophagy pathway. The
  signaling pathway components targeted in this study are highlighted by colored circles.
  (B) Schematic illustration of the ultrastructure and basic function of podocyte-like
  Drosophila nephrocytes. The bi-nucleated nephrocytes remove undesired particles
  (green hexagons) from the larval plasma (hemolymph) by endocytic uptake for subsequent
  storage, degradation, or recycling. Endocytosis occurs in membrane invaginations
  covered by a bi-layered filtration barrier consisting of the basement membrane (gray
  surface) and the slit diaphragm formed by the proteins Sns and Kirre (depicted in
  green and red). (C–G’’) Confocal microscopy of nephrocytes co-stained for Sns (nephrin)
  and Pyd (ZO-1). Magnified regions of the tangential sections are shown in the upper
  insets, and surface details from cross-sections in the lower insets. lacZ expressing
  control cells display the regular fingerprint pattern of slit diaphragms (C–C’’)
  while cells expressing either Tor-RNAi (D–D’’) or a dominant-negative variant of
  Tor (Tor-DN, E–E’’) under control of pros-GAL4 show wider spacing. In contrast,
  induction of mTOR signaling by expression of Tsc1-RNAi (F–F’’) or overexpression
  of Rheb (G–G’’) results in a regular slit diaphragm pattern comparable to control
  cells. (H) Quantification of the distance between two slit diaphragms is shown analogous
  to conditions in (C–G’’). Distances were measured along a linear path representing
  the widest diameter of individual cells. Data shows mean ± standard deviation, n
  = 9 animals per genotype with three cells for each animal (every dot, square or
  triangle represents one animal of the indicated genotype). Statistical differences
  were assessed by one-way ANOVA with post-hoc analysis, p < 0.0001 (****) for Tor-RNAi,
  p < 0.0001 (****) for Tor-DN, p > 0.05 (ns) for Tsc1-RNAi, p > 0.05 (ns) for Rheb.
  (I–K) Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of cells expressing lacZ (I),
  Tor-RNAi (J), or overexpressing Rheb (K). Increased and irregular distances of slit
  diaphragms are exclusively observed upon expression of Tor-RNAi (slit diaphragms
  highlighted by arrowheads). Inhibition of mTOR further reduced the depth of the
  labyrinthine channels representing membrane invaginations. In contrast, labyrinthine
  channels are deeper when mTOR signaling is induced by overexpression of Rheb while
  slit diaphragm distances are regular.
