caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis of the 676 host cell genes significantly correlated
  (FDR < 0.1) with changes in the Shannon diversity index in patients with chronic
  obstructive pulmonary disease treated with salmeterol/fluticasone. (a) Top 50 canonical
  pathways of genes significantly correlated to changes in the Shannon diversity index.
  (b) Enriched biological functions, cellular processes and diseases. The number in
  the parentheses represents genes from our 676 gene dataset that overlap with genes
  that appear in the enriched biological function, cellular process or disease.
