caption: a Heatmap of active outgoing signaling pathways in different clusters. b
  Heatmap of active incoming signaling pathways in different clusters. The heatmap
  color bar in (a) and (b) represents the relative signaling strength of a signaling
  pathway across cell groups, determined by computing the network centrality scores
  by Cellchat to find dominant senders (sources) and receivers (targets). c Circle
  plot of the THY1 signaling pathway from CellChat. Receptor-ligand edges were annotated
  by communication probability. d Circle plot of the NOTCH signaling pathway from
  CellChat. Receptor-ligand edges were annotated by communication probability.
