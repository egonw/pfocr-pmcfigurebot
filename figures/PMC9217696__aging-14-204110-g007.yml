caption: The LINC00094/ miR-19a-3p /CYP19A1 axis affects EMT progression in breast
  cancer. (A) Western Blot was used to detect the protein expression levels of CDH1
  and Vimentin in BT-474 transfected cells, with GAPDH as internal reference. The
  experiment was repeated for 3 times. **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001. (B) Western
  Blot was used to detect the protein expression level of CDH2 in BT-474 transfected
  cells, with GAPDH as internal reference. The experiment was repeated for 3 times.
  * P <0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001. (C) Western Blot was used to detect
  the protein expression levels of CDH1 and Vimentin in MCF-7 transfected cells, with
  GAPDH as internal reference. The experiment was repeated for 3 times. **P<0.01,
  ****P<0.0001. (D) Western Blot was used to detect the protein expression level of
  CDH2 in MCF-7 transfected cells, with GAPDH as internal reference. The experiment
  was repeated for 3 times. **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.
