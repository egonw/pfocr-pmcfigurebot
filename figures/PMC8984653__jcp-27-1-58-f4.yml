figure_title: Effect of 6-(methylsulfinyl) hexyl isothiocyanate (6-MSITC) on the expression
  of Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) and Sirtuin1 (B)
caption: HepG2 cells were treated with 10 μM of 6-MSITC for 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 36, and
  48 hours (A), or with indicated concentrations of 6-MSITC for 12 and 24 hours (B).
  The whole-cell lysates were used to detect FOXO1, p-FOXO1, Sirtuin1 and β-actin
  by Western blot analysis with their respective antibodies. Densitometry of the blots
  was performed using the LumiVision Imager software. Histograms show the densitometric
  analysis of FOXO1, p-FOXO1 and Sirtuin1 normalized to β-actin. The data were from
  triplicate tests. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.05.
