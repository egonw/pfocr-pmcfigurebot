figure_title: Analysis of G1-HIF- and cell cycle-dependent gene expression
caption: A Scheme depicting the experimental set-up. B DEGs matching the filtering
  criteria ( ± FC ≥ 2-fold, P ≤ 0.05 comparing each time point to the 0 control) at
  4, 12 and 24 h after cell cycle release were collected and their normalized expression
  values are displayed along the values in the corresponding nocodazole-arrested conditions
  (gray). Violin plots show the distribution of the mean expression values, red lines
  show medians and dashed lines indicate the interquartile range containing 50% of
  values above and below the median. Total numbers of DEGs according to cell type
  and nutritional condition are indicated. C, D Volcano plot representations of pairwise
  comparisons of HCT-116 OsTIR1 with HCT-116 HIF-1α AID cells across all conditions
  where ratio values were calculated by Desq2. Blue and red colors highlight HIF-1α
  AID-dependent DEGs ( ± FC ≥ 1.5-fold, P ≤ 0.05). E Venn diagram comparing the time-dependent
  distribution of regulated DEGs (up- or down) at nutrient-rich (left) and nutrient-poor
  (right) conditions. F G1-HIF-dependent DEGs were further used to perform an overrepresentation
  analysis using Metascape. The enriched pathway terms are indicated, the gray fields
  visualize lack of enrichment. Time points in red color refer to cells grown in nutrient-poor
  medium.
