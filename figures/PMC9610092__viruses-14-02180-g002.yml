caption: Expression of genes belonging to the canonical IFN-γ pathway in non-COVID-19
  and COVID-19 patients. (A) Schematic representation of IFN-γ signaling pathway associated
  genes. The canonical IFN-γ pathway is represented in green. (B) Gene expression
  analysis (log2 (norm counts +1)) for (i) IFNG, (ii) IFNGR1, (iii) IFNGR2, (iv) JAK1,
  (v) JAK2, and (vi) STAT1 in COVID-19 (purple) vs. non-COVID-19 (pink) patients from
  the GSE152075 dataset, assessed by RNA-seq. p-values correspond to Wilcoxon rank-sum
  test. Black squares represent the median. (C) Heatmaps depicting the fold change
  (high = pink; low = blue) for gene expression of genes belonging to the canonical
  IFN-γ pathway considering sex (i) and age groups 30 s, 40 s, 50 s, 60 s, and 70
  s vs. <30 (ii) in non-COVID-19 (left panel) and COVID-19 (right panel) patients
  from the GSE152075 dataset, assessed by RNA-seq. p-values correspond to decreasing
  Jonckheere–Terpstra trend test. Statistical significance * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01;
  *** p < 0.001.
