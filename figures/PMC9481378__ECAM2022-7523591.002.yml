caption: 'miR-29b-1-5p negatively regulates the RTN4 and Akt/ERK signaling pathway,
  thus promoting LPS-induced injury and inflammatory response in vitro. (a) Analysis
  of the miRWalk and RNA22 databases. (b) Luciferase activity assays of the RTN4-Wt
  and RTN4-Mut in the presence of miR-29b-1-5p mimic or inhibitor. (c), The mRNA level
  of RTN4 was determined by using qRT-PCR and the protein expression of RTN4A/B, the
  p-Akt and p-ERK1/2 extent by using Western blot analysis. (d) The levels of IL-1β,
  IL-8, TNF-α, and IL-6 in the supernatant derived from LPS-conditioned MH-S cells
  were measured using the ELISA method. (e) The viability of LPS-conditioned MH-S
  cells was evaluated using CCK-8 assay at indicated time points. (f) The apoptosis
  rate of LPS-conditioned MH-S cells. ∗, p < 0.05 vs. MH-S cells, #p < 0.05 vs. LPS-conditioned
  MH-S cells, and p < 0.05 vs. MH-S cells treated with miR-29b-1-5p mimic.'
