caption: (a) Effect of nomilin on the activity of mushroom tyrosinase during the catalysis
  of L-DOPA (enzyme concentration 4.0 µg/mL). (b) Relationship between catalytic activity
  of mushroom tyrosinase and enzyme concentration at different concentrations of nomilin.
  Concentrations of nomilin for curves 1-4 were 0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.15 mM, respectively.
  (c) Lineweaver-Burk plots for the nomilin-mediated inhibition of mushroom tyrosinase
  during the catalysis of DOPA at 30 °C and pH 6.8. Concentrations of quercetin for
  curves 1-4 were 0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.15 mM, respectively; enzyme concentration was
  4.0 µg/mL. The inset represents the plot of Kmapp versus quercetin concentration
  for determining the inhibition constant KI. (d) Kinetic parameters and microscopic
  inhibition rate constants of mushroom tyrosinase in the presence of nomilin.
