caption: 'Sensitization of the sustained component from the Off pathway contributes
  to On sensitization. A, Example firing rate plot and spiking traces of a dorsal
  pDSGC responding to test spot stimuli before and after induction stimulus in the
  presence of l-AP-4. B, Summary graphs comparing the sensitization indices for the
  Off and the sustained components of spiking activity in control (Ames'' solution,
  n = 8 cells from 3 mice) versus in the presence of l-AP-4 (n = 8 cells from 3 mice).
  For Off spiking: control, *p = 0.011; strychnine, *p = 0.020; control versus strychnine,
  p = 0.81. For sustained spiking: control, **p = 0.0096; strychnine, **p = 0.0054;
  control versus strychnine, p = 0.40. C, Scatter plot comparing the increase of firing
  rates of the On spiking response versus that of the sustained component. Black dots
  represent individual cells (n = 8 cells from 3 mice), and the dashed line indicates
  linear regression fit. D, Example PSP traces of a dorsal pDSGC during test spot
  stimulus before (black) and after (red) induction stimulus in the presence of l-AP-4.
  E, F, Summary plots comparing the sensitization indices of PSPs in control (n =
  10 cells from 4 mice) versus in the presence of l-AP-4 (n = 7 cells from 2 mice).
  For Off PSP: control, *p = 0.014; l-AP-4, **p = 0.0096; control versus l-AP-4, p
  = 0.68. For sustained PSP: control, ***p < 0.001; l-AP-4, ***p < 0.001; control
  versus l-AP-4, p = 0.65 (E). For PSP area during 60 ms after test spot onset in
  the presence of l-AP-4, ***p < 0.001 (F). G, Example EPSC traces during test spot
  stimulus before (black) and after (red) induction stimulus in the presence of l-AP-4.
  H, I, Comparison of the EPSC sensitization indices in control (n = 8 cells from
  6 mice) versus in the presence of l-AP-4 (n = 8 cells from 3 mice). For Off EPSC:
  control, *p = 0.022; l-AP-4, *p = 0.035; control versus l-AP-4, p = 0.65. For sustained
  EPSC: control, ***p < 0.001; l-AP-4, ***p < 0.001; control versus l-AP-4, p = 0.71
  (H). For EPSC charge transfer during 60 ms after test spot onset in the presence
  of l-AP-4, *p = 0.044 (I). J, A mechanistic model of sensitization of the On responses
  of On-Off DSGCs. Dorsal DSGC gained an elevated baseline depolarization originating
  from disinhibition of Off BCs by glycinergic ACs. Such sustained depolarization
  propagates to On dendritic arbors and enhances the subsequent On response. In contrast,
  ventral DSGCs do not have sustained depolarization and thus only show sensitized
  Off responses but not sensitized On responses after induction stimulus.'
