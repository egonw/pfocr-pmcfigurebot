caption: Metabolic pathway mapping of some of the identified metabolites in the extracts
  of the differentiated THP-1 cells treated with plain, Pluronic–coated, and PEG–PLGA
  NPs and control. Results are expressed as the average peak intensity ± SEM (****p
  < 0.0001, ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, and *p < 0.05).
