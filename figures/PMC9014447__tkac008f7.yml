caption: Scavenging ROS by NAC alleviated PMVECs cell apoptosis caused by interruption
  of Notch signaling. (a) Fluorescence intensity and analysis of ROS in primary PMVECs
  treated with GSI, DMSO + NAC, and GSI + NAC, while DMSO as control, **p < 0.01 (b)
  Apoptosis and analysis in primary PMVECs treated with GSI, DMSO + NAC, and GSI + NAC,
  while DMSO as control, Q2 + Q3 represents apoptosis, **p < 0.01. PMVECs pulmonary
  microvascular endothelial cells, GSI γ-secretase inhibitor, NAC N-acetyl-L-cysteine,
  PI propidium Iodide, GFP OP9 cells over-express GFP, DLL1 OP9 cells over-express
