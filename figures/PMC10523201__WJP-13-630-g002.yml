caption: 'miR-320e could bind to Wnt2 to inhibit the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. A: The
  results of the dual-luciferase reporter gene experiment; B: Binding sequence between
  Wnt2 mRNA and miR-320e; C and D: Protein blots were listed in the column. After
  cotransfection of the miR-320e mimic, western blotting showed that Wnt2, FZD2, Axin2,
  GSK3β, and β-catenin expression increased compared with that of the control group.
  After cotransfection of the miR-320e inhibitor, western blotting showed that Wnt2,
  FZD2, Axin2, GSK3β, and β-catenin expression decreased compared with that of the
  control group; E: Cell image after cotransfection of cells. The image above showed
  transfection with miR-320e mimic and the one below showed transfection with miR-320e
  inhibitor. aP < 0.05, bP < 0.01, cP < 0.001.'
