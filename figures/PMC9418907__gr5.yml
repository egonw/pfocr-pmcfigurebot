caption: TCDD-elicited effects on gene expression involved in hepatic uptake, metabolism,
  and trafficking of cobalamin (Cbl).A, overview of Cbl uptake, metabolism, and trafficking
  in the mouse liver. B, the presence of putative dioxin response elements (pDREs)
  and AhR genomic binding 2 h after a single bolus dose of 30 μg/kg TCDD. C, hepatic
  expression of genes associated with Cbl uptake, metabolism, and trafficking in a
  time course study. Male C57BL/6 mice (n = 3) were administered a single bolus dose
  of 30 μg/kg TCDD. Liver samples were collected at the corresponding time point.
  Color scale represents the log2(fold change) for differential gene expression determined
  by RNA-Seq analysis. Counts represent the maximum number of raw aligned reads for
  any treatment group. Low counts (<500 reads) are denoted in yellow with high counts
  (>10,000) in pink. D, dose-dependent gene expression was assessed in mice (n = 3)
  following oral gavage with sesame oil vehicle or TCDD. E, diurnally regulated genes
  are denoted with a “Y”. An orange ‘X’ indicates disrupted diurnal rhythm following
  oral gavage with 30 μg/kg TCDD every 4 days for 28 days. ZT indicates statistically
  significant (P1(t) > 0.8) time of maximum gene induction/repression. Differential
  expression with a posterior probability (P1(t)) > 0.80 is indicated with a black
  triangle in the upper right tile corner. TCDD, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin;
  AHR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor; Cbl, cobalamin; ZT, zeitgeber time.
