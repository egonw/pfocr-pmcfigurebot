caption: '(A) Western blot analysis of overexpression of vector, DDX41-WT, or DDX41-R525H
  in DDX41 KO THP-1 cells with the indicated antibodies. β-actin serves as a loading
  control.(B–F) qPCR analysis of the expression of IFN-β gene (B), cGAS oligomerization
  (C), cGAMP production (D), STING dimerization (E), and luciferase activity (F) in
  vector, DDX41-WT, or DDX41-R525H expressed in DDX41 KO THP-1 macrophages after poly(dA:dT)
  treatment. For (B), GAPDH serves as an internal control, and time 0 was set as 1;
  for C and E, denaturing condition and β-actin were used as loading controls; for
  D, mock was set as 1; for F, time 0 was set as 1.(G and H) Western blot analysis
  of WT THP-1 cells expressing vector (G and H), FLAG-tagged DDX41-WT or DDX41-R525H
  (G), and FLAG-tagged DDX43-WT or DDX43-D396A (H), with indicated antibodies. β-actin
  serves as a loading control.(I and J) qPCR analysis of the expression of IFN-β gene
  (I) and luciferase activity (J) in WT THP-1 macrophages expressing vector, DDX41-WT,
  DDX43-WT, DDX41-R525H, or DDX43-D396A after poly (dA:dT) treatment. GAPDH serves
  as an internal control and time 0 was set as 1.(K) Increased IFN-responsible genes
  occurring in R525H-expressing patient cells determined by GSEA (three patients with
  the R525H mutation were compared with 20 patients without the mutation). Normalized
  enrichment score, nominal p value, and false discovery rate (FDR) q value are indicated
  at the bottom.(L) A representative image of helicase analysis on a 30-bp forked
  duplex DNA using indicated DDX41 proteins. Helicase reactions were performed by
  incubating with increasing protein (0–300 nM) and 0.5 nM duplex DNA substrate at
  37°C for 15 min. NE, no enzyme. The triangle indicates heat-denatured DNA substrate
  control.(M) A representative image of strand-annealing reactions using 0.5 nM two
  ssDNA (one labeled with 32P) for forked 30-bp dsDNA substrates and DDX41 proteins
  (0–150 nM) without ATP. NE + Com, no enzyme with complementary strand added.(N)
  A model of DDX41’s role in the activation and inactivation of the cGAS-STING-type
  I IFN pathway. Upon DNA virus infection, DDX41 protein expression increases, and
  its strand-annealing activity dominates over its unwinding activity, and the produced
  dsDNA activates the cGAS-STING-IFN pathway. Once the virus is cleared, DDX41 expression
  reduces, and its unwinding activity dominates over its annealing activity, and the
  produced ssDNA inactivates the cGAS-STING-IFN pathway. Ac, acetylation. For simplicity,
  only cytosolic cGAS is shown.For (B), (D), (F), (I), and (J): data represent the
  mean ± SEM of three independent experiments. ns, not significant (p ≥ 0.05). ****p
  < 0.0001, ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, and *p < 0.05.'
