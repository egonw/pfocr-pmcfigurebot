caption: QACs enhanced cell outer membrane permeability. (a) Relative fluorescence
  intensity of NPN and (b) relative content of LPS under QACs exposure at 0.4 mg/L.
  (c) The illustration of lipopolysaccharide synthesis pathway and gene expression
  level related to LPS synthesis. (d) Gene expression levels associated with lipoprotein.
  (e) Cell number of transconjugants of intragenera and (f) intergenera mating system.
  Donor and recipients were treated by EDTA at 0.5 mM or QACs at 0.4 mg/L. Independent-sample
  t-test (a, b, e and f) was used to compare the differences between QACs-treated
  and the control group, and are indicated by * P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01.
