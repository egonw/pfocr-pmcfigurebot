caption: ABA metabolism in pomegranate skin. Illustration of the metabolic pathway
  combined with heatmap visualization of differentially expressed genes in the skin
  of early (left column), mid-growth (middle column), and ripening (right column)
  fruit. Genes involved in each metabolic step are represented by their respective
  gene IDs. The color index indicates upregulation (red) or downregulation (blue)
  of a gene relative to the group of genes putatively encoding the same function;
  expression level values and full gene names are given in .
