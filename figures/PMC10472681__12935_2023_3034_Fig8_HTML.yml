caption: ASO-MALAT1 impedes xenograft tumour growth. (a) Graphic illustration of xenograft
  tumours and ASO NC or ASO MALAT1 injection in nude mice. (b-d) The xenograft tumours
  formed by Huh7 and Hep3B cells injected with ASO-MALAT1 were significantly smaller
  than those injected with NC-MALAT1. (e) IHC staining was used to detect the expression
  of BRF2 in xenograft tumours of nude mice. Scale, 100 μm. (f) Schematic depiction
  of the mechanisms underlying. ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001
article_title: MALAT1/ mir-1-3p mediated BRF2 expression promotes HCC progression
  via inhibiting the LKB1/AMPK signaling pathway.
