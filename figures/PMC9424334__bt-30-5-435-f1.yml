caption: CKD-581 increases acetylated proteins and suppresses cell proliferation in
  hematologic cancer cells. (A) The chemical structure of CKD-581. (B) Acetylation
  of histone H3, H4 and tubulin. MM.1S cells were treated with 30-1000 nM CKD-581
  or SAHA for 6 h. Acetylation of proteins was analyzed by immunoblottings. (C) Inhibitory
  effects of CKD-581 and SAHA on cell viabilities of hematologic cancer cell lines.
  All data represent mean ± SEM of at least three independent experiments.
