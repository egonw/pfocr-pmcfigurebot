caption: Bioinformatics analysis of CILP2 related proteins (genes) and signaling pathways.
  (a) Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network constructed by STRING database. Known
  interactions including experimentally determined and database obtained are pink
  edges and dark blue edges. The predicted interactions are green edge (gene neighborhood),
  blue edge (gene co-occurrence), and red edge (gene fusion). The yellow green edge
  is text mining. Black edges indicate common expression. Lavender edges indicate
  protein homology. (b) GO annotation analysis of cellular components (CC). (c) GO
  annotation analysis of molecular function (MF). (d) GO annotation analysis of biological
  process (BP). (e) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. The gradient color represents
  the p value. The size of the bubble represents the number of genes.
