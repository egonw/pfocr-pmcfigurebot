caption: Promoter hypermethylation induced ANKRD29 low expression in NSCLC. A Methylation
  levels in normal tissues and LUAD or LUSC tissues from SMART website. B-C ANKRD29
  expression was detected by qRT-PCR (B) and immunoblot (C) in NSCLC cells treated
  with 5-Azacytidine (5-Aza) or DMSO. The red arrow indicated the target band of ANKRD29
  protein. D Four ANKRD29 CpG sites of high methylation levels including cg26522239,
  cg04164415, cg13421439 and cg26822986 predicted a poor prognosis. Bars are the mean
  value ± SD. ns = no significant. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001

  cell lung cancer, inhibits cell growth and migration by regulating MAPK signaling
  pathway.
