caption: 'ANCO1 reduction increases chromatin accessibility and enhances H3K27Ac binding
  at known breast cancer enhancers. (A) Heatmaps and summary plots of detection q-values
  of ANCO1-regulated H3K27Ac peaks in 10A and DCIS shANCO1 versus control cell lines
  overlaid to the center of the peaks. Blue and green curves in the summary plot for
  the DCIS line indicate up- or down-regulated peaks in shANCO1 cells, respectively.
  The shANCO1 #3 cell line was used for this analysis. The 43 down-regulated peaks
  in 10A shANCO1 cells were not included in the heatmap due to the small number. (B)
  Heatmaps and summary plots of read counts of ANCO1-regulated H3K27Ac peaks in 10A
  and DCIS shANCO1 and control cell lines overlaid to known breast cancer enhancer
  regions []. (C) Venn diagram showing unique and shared ANCO1-regulated H3K27Ac peaks
  in 10A and DCIS cell lines. (D) DAVID pathway analysis results of top 25 enriched
  pathways in genes annotated to ANCO1-regulated H3K27Ac peaks in 10A and DCIS cell
  lines. Ranking was based on âˆ’log10 (p-value) values in the DCIS line. (E) Selected
  HOMER motif enrichment analysis results of up-regulated H3K27Ac peaks in shANCO1
  versus control cells. The known motif method was used for discovery.'
