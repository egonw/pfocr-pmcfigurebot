caption: The miR-146a-5p–MLCK3–p-MLC2 pathway functions differently in the aging heart
  in response to ischaemia. Ischaemia stimulates increase of miR-146a-5p, which inhibits
  MMP2/16 expression and leads to increased expression of MLCK3 in the heart, elevated
  level of MLCK3, and subsequently MLC2 phosphorylation. Thus, promoting myofilament
  contraction post ischaemia. This MMP2/16–MLCK3–p-MLC2 pathway functions differently
  in response to miR-146a-5p in aging and young heart tissues, dysregulated by impaired
  up-regulation of miR-146a-5p in aging heart.

  to myocardial ischaemic injury in aging mice.
