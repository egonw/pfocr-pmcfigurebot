caption: IL-17–mediated metabolic regulation in adipose tissue. The IL-17 pathway
  exerts an antiadipogenic role by suppressing adipocyte differentiation through decreased
  expression of proadipogenic TFs. IL-17A promotes thermogenesis in BAT by supporting
  a UCP1-dependent thermogenic response. Moreover, IL-17 synergizes with TNF-α to
  induce IL-33 by stromal adipose cells, leading to T reg cell expansion. IL-17F is
  reported to trigger sympathetic innervation and norepinephrine (NE) release.
