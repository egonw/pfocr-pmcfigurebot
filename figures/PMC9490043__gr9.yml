caption: Inhibition of the Cdc20-APC/C pathway promotes apoptosis in H460 cells.A–E,
  H460 cells were treated with Apcin (50 μM) and pro-TAME (40 μM) (A + T) for 48 h.
  Treatment with DMSO served as control. Attached cells were then counted with a hemocytometer
  (A), subjected to bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assays (B), and crystal
  violet staining (C) (Scale bar = 2 mm). Cells were also stained with DAPI (Scale
  bar = 50 μm). Representative images are shown in (D), quantification of cells with
  fragmented nuclei is shown in (E). F, H460 cells were treated with increasing concentrations
  of Apcin (1.56, 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 μM) and pro-TAME (1.25, 2.5, 5, 10,
  20, and 40 μM) for 48 h. Cell survival was then quantified by MTT assay. Values
  in (A), (B), (E), and (F) represent means ± SEM; statistical comparisons were made
  using the student’s t test. ∗p < 0.001.
