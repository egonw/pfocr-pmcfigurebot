caption: FAT4 overexpression inhibits the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in cervical cancer
  cells. A KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Note that FAT4 overexpression is highly
  relevant for the Wnt signaling pathway, N-Glycan biosynthesis, and immune editing-related
  pathways and these findings are consistent in the C33A and ME180 cell lines. B Immunofluorescence
  staining for FAT4 (red) and total-β-catenin (green) in ME180 cells. In CTRL cells,
  the total-β-catenin runs throughout the cytoplasm, and sgFAT4 is enriched in the
  cell membrane, with significant co-localization with FAT4. C The co-immunoprecipitation
  assay detects increased binding of overexpressed FAT4 to endogenous β-catenin. Immunoprecipitation
  with β-catenin antibody followed by immunoblotting with FAT4 antibody. D Interaction
  among the degradation complex (AXIN, GSK3β, CK1α, APC) and β-catenin in CTRL or
  FAT4 overexpression cells was determined by co-immunoprecipitation assay. Immunoprecipitation
  with β-catenin antibody followed by immunoblotting with AXIN, GSK3β, CK1α, and APC
  antibodies. E Immunoblotting was used to detect the expression of active-β-catenin,
  total-β-catenin, C-Myc, MMP9, and Cyclin D1, phospho-GSK-3β (Ser9) and total-GSK-3β
  in CTRL or FAT4 overexpression cells. F FAT4 inhibits β-catenin/TCF/TEF luciferase
  reporter activity. The TOPFlash/FOPFlash luciferase reporter assay was performed
  in CTRL or sgFAT4 ME180 cells. pSV40-Renilla was used as an internal control. G&H
  Immunohistochemical images (H) and Immunoreactivity score (G) of active-β-catenin
  and total-β-catenin expression in U14 C57BL/6 xenografts. ***P < 0.001 and ****P < 0.0001
