caption: 'PUG decreases the protein expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in activated
  RAW264.7 cells: The cells were treated with LPS (1 μg/mL) and PUG (4, and 6 μM)
  for 1 h and 24 h, respectively. After treatment the RNA was isolated from all the
  groups and converted into cDNA. Then the converted cDNA was used for qRT-PCR with
  the kit components. The graph was plotted using Cq values by the 2−ΔΔCq method.
  The relative expression of each gene was calculated by normalizing with the β-Actin
  gene. (A) Relative expression of IL-6. (B) Relative expression of TNFα. (C) Relative
  expression of IL-1β. The statistical significance was ### p < 0.001 vs. untreated
  group; and ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 vs. LPS-alone treated group.'
