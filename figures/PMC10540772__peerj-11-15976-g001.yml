figure_title: TLR7 is overexpressed in rosacea
caption: '(A) Top-ranked upregulated KEGG terms that were differentially regulated
  between rosacea patients and healthy people revealed through gene set enrichment
  analysis (GSEA). The toll-like receptor signaling pathway was highlighted in red
  box. (B) GSEA on RNA-sequencing data from rosacea versus HS skin samples shows enrichment
  for the toll-like receptor signaling pathway in rosacea. HS, healthy samples; NES,
  normal enrichment score. Significance was calculated by permutation test. (C) The
  fold change of TLRs in RNA-seq analysis between rosacea and HS samples. TLR7 and
  TLR8 were highlighted in red box. TLRS, Toll-like receptors. (D) The mRNA expression
  levels of TLR7 in the epidermis of human rosacea lesions. HS, n = 17; Rosacea, n
  = 24. (E) Correlation of TLR7 mRNA expression in the epidermis of human rosacea
  lesions (n = 24) with the CEA scores. Spearman’s correlation coefficient was used
  for the correlation analysis (two-tailed). (F) Correlation of TLR7 mRNA expression
  in the epidermis of human rosacea lesions (n = 24) with the IGA scores. Spearman’s
  correlation coefficient was used for the correlation analysis (two-tailed). (G)
  Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of TLR7 on skin sections from HS and rosacea. Epi, epidermis;
  Der, dermis. Scale bar: 200 µm. (H) The mRNA expression levels of Tlr7 in skin lesions
  from control and LL37-induced mice (n = 6 for each group). (I) Immunostaining of
  TLR7 in skin lesions from control and LL37-induced mice. DAPI staining (blue) indicates
  nuclear localization. Scale bar: 200 µm. n = 6 for each group. Data represent the
  mean ± SEM. ** P < 0.01. Two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test (H) was used.'
