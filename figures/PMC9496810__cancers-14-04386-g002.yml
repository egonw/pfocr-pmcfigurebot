caption: Biological and small molecule approach toward defining mimetic drug candidates
  able to reactivate the signaling pathway normally controlled by the C2TSG protein.
  Restoration of these growth suppressive signaling pathways should have a significant
  inhibitory effect on tumor initiation and progression.
