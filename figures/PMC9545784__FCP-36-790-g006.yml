caption: Effect of EDB on spatial reference memory in the MWMT in mice. (a) Representative
  swimming tracks of mice at Day 5 in different groups. (b) Mean daily escape latencies
  (time from the starting to the hidden platform). (c) The percentage of time spent
  in the target quadrant during the probe trial. (d) Numbers of crossing platform
  site spent in target quadrant during the probe trials. (*) significant difference
  (*P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01) vs. sham group; (#) significant difference (#P < 0.05)
  vs. CIRI group; ($) significant difference ($P < 0.05 and $$P < 0.01) vs. KO sham
  group;*P < 0.05;**P < 0.01; ns no statistical significance. N = 12 mice per group
