caption: 'CBL0137 activates NK cell-mediated killing of virus-infected cells. (A)
  Total RNAs were extracted from NK-92 cells treated with CBL0137 (500 nM) or DMSO
  at four independent replicates, and subjected to RNA-seq analysis. A volcano plot
  was constructed for RNA-seq results. (B) Correlation between RNA-seq and RT-qPCR
  data for the selected ISGs was determined by Pearson''s r with statistical significance.
  (C) Upregulation of selected ISGs in RNA-seq data of NK-92 cells treated with CBL0137
  was illustrated in a heatmap (R package: pheatmap). (D) Pathway analysis was performed
  for RNA-seq data of NK-92 cells treated with CBL0137 using GO biological process
  (BP) (R package: clusterProfiler). (E) NK-92 cells treated with CBL0137 (500 nM)
  or DMSO were co-cultured with or without K562 cells, followed by the protein immunofluorescence
  analysis of CD107a or IFNγ in NK-92 cells by flow cytometry. Percentage of cell
  population expressing CD107a or IFNγ as well as the mean fluorescence intensity
  (MFI) of CD107a or IFNγ were calculated and normalized to DMSO without K562 stimulation.
  (F) Schematic illustration of the procedure to measure NK cell-mediated killing
  of ZIKV-infected cells. (G) Knockdown of SUPT16H by its siRNAs in NK-92 cells was
  confirmed by both protein immunoblotting and RT-qPCR. (H–J) NK-92 cells transfected
  with SUPT16H or NT siRNAs (H), treated with CBL0137 (500 nM) or DMSO (I), or primary
  NK cells treated with CBL0137 (500 nM) or DMSO (J), were co-cultured with mock or
  ZIKV-infected HeLa cells. Viability of HeLa cells was measured by using ATP-based
  assay (upper panel), and converted to cell killing efficacy (lower panel, lines
  in plots indicate median and 25%/75% percentile). Viability of HeLa cells without
  co-culture with NK cells nor ZIKV infection was set as 100% (NC: negative control;
  Mo: mono-culture of HeLa; Co: co-culture of HeLa with NK). Results were calculated
  from four biological replicates for J, and three independent experiments for all
  others (* P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001, **** P < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA for
  H–J [upper panel], E, and Student''s t-test for H–J [lower panel]).'
