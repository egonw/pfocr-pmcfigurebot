caption: 'EA modulated the expression of serum exosomal miR-34c-5p and colonic miR-34c-5p.
  (a) Serum exosomes (arrows) were observed under a TEM, bar = 100 nm and 500 nm.
  (b) The particle size was measured using NTA. (c) RT-qPCR was used to measure the
  relative expression level of exosomal miR-34c-5p with miR-39 used as the internal
  reference. (d) RT-qPCR detected the relative expression of miR-34c-5p in colonic
  tissues; ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 compared with the control group; ##P < 0.01 compared
  with STC group; &&P < 0.01 compared with STC + EA group.'
