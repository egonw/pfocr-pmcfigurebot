caption: Diagrammatic representation of the overall general process flow of this study
  showing the RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) datasets of 4 patients with severe COVID-19
  and 4 healthy controls, from whom peripheral blood samples were obtained from GSE167930.
  Then, the raw data were processed to identify the differentially expressed gene
  (DEGs). We used these DEGs for Gene Ontology and pathway analysis and proteinâ€“protein
  interaction (PPI) analysis. The most significant gene cluster in the PPI network
  was identified and used for biological process enrichment analysis. Genes in this
  cluster were found to play a role in protein ubiquitination. Then, the analysis
  of genes involved in protein ubiquitination was performed to identify the network
  of protein-chemical interactions for potent chemical agents, as well as transcription
  factors and microRNAs at regulatory checkpoints. Ultimately, single-cell RNA-Seq
  analysis of an online dataset was carried out to reveal the expression of the genes
  regulating protein ubiquitination that is specific to different cell types.
