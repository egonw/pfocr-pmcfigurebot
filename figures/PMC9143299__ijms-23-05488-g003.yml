caption: 'NO promotes adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Adipocytes were
  cultured in the presence or absence of NONOate (0, 10, 20, and 30 μM) to determine
  its cytotoxicity (A). Adipocyte differentiation was induced in the continued presence
  of the same concentrations of NONOate in later experiments. After differentiation,
  intracellular lipid content was determined by measuring fluorescent staining (Bar:
  100 µm) (B) and triglycerides (TG) (C). Results are shown as mean ± SD for three
  independent experiments. * p < 0.05 compared to the untreated group.'
