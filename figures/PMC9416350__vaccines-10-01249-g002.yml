caption: 'Immunological mechanism of action of the peptide-based vaccines. After its
  administration, the peptides will be recognized by innate immune cells that promote
  the activation of the adaptive immune response (cellular and humoral). Released
  antibodies can promote the destruction of tumoral cells by ADCC, CDC, ADCP, signaling
  inhibition, and complement activation (classical pathway), whereas cytotoxic T cells
  can promote apoptosis of cancer cells by releasing perforins and granzymes or by
  interacting with Fas/FasL. APC: antigen-presenting cell; MHC-I: major histocompatibility
  complex type I; MHC-II: major histocompatibility complex type II; Th1: T helper
  1; Th2: T helper 2; ADCC: antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity; CDC: complement-dependent
  cytotoxicity; ADCP: antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis. Image created in Biorender
