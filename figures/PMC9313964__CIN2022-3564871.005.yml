caption: 'Autophagy affects cell proliferation and apoptosis through KEAP1/Nrf2 signaling
  pathway. (a) The expression levels of KEAP1 by RT-qPCR. ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. PFC group.
  ##P < 0.01 vs. PFC + BLM group. (b) The expression levels of Nrf2 by RT-qPCR. ∗∗P
  < 0.01 vs. PFC group. #P < 0.05 vs. PFC + BLM group. (c) The expression levels of
  KEAP1 and Nrf2 by Western blotting assay. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. PFC group. #P < 0.05 vs.
  PFC + BLM group. (d) The cell proliferation of PFC cells were examined by CCK-8
  assay. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. PFC group. #P < 0.05 vs. PFC + BLM group. (e) The cell apoptosis
  of PFC cells were examined by CCK-8 assay. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. PFC group. #P < 0.05,
  ##P < 0.01 vs. PFC + BLM group.'
