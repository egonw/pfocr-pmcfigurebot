figure_title: Rptor depletion leads to vaginal atrophy via promoting cell death and
  inhibiting cell proliferation
caption: 'A Representative images of the external vaginal orifice in control (n = 5)
  and Rptor cKO (n = 5) female mice. B 3D renderings of the female reproductive tract
  in control (n = 5) and Rptor cKO (n = 5) mice based on MRI T2 weighted images. Scale
  bars: 5 mm. C Accurate max and min diameter statistics of the vagina were measured
  based on B. Values are expressed as the mean ± SEM. (D) Representative HE-stained
  vaginal sections of control and Rptor cKO mice at 8 weeks (left) (n = 5 mice in
  each group) and postnatal day 28 (right) (n = 3 mice in each group). The experiments
  were repeated 3 times. Microscopy with magnification ×10. Scale bars: 200 μm. E,
  F Control and Rptor cKO mice were ovariectomized and rested for 2 weeks. E2 was
  administrated for 3 consecutive days. Representative images of the PAS (E) or Ki67
  (F) staining of the vagina in control and Rptor cKO mice. Nuclei were stained with
  hematoxylin. n = 3 in each group. The experiments were repeated 3 times. Microscopy
  with magnification ×20. Scale bars: 50 μm. G Representative images of the TUNEL
  immunofluorescence staining in the vagina of OVX mice following E2 administration.
  Nuclei were stained with DAPI. n = 3 in each group. The experiments were repeated
  3 times. Microscopy with magnification ×20. Scale bars: 75 μm.'
