caption: The transcription levels (mean + SD) of (a, d) the nuclear factor‐κB subunit
  RelA (RelA; p65), (b, e) nuclear factor‐κB subunit 1 (NF‐κB1; p105/p50) and (c,
  f) nuclear factor‐κB subunit 2 (NF‐κB2; p100/p52) in the mares' endometrium in follicular
  (FLP) or mid‐luteal (MLP) phases of the oestrous cycle. The endometrial samples
  evaluated with respect to the intensity of inflammatory cell infiltrate (none, mild,
  moderate and severe) are shown in graphs a, b and c, and according to the type of
  inflammatory cell infiltration (macrophages, neutrophils, lymphocytes and mixed
  cells) or no cell infiltration detected (none) in d, e and f. No differences were
  found between the phases of the oestrous cycle for any of the studied NF‐κB subunits
