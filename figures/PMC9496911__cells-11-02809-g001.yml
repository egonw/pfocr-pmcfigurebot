caption: Melatonin can reduce neuron damage after SCI and speed up the recovery of
  motor function. (A) The BMS scores of mice four weeks after spinal cord injury to
  assess the motor function of mice in the sham, vehicle, MT, and MT+ML385 groups
  (n = 10, Tukey’s post hoc test followed by two-way ANOVA). (B) Design route of this
  research. (C,D) Nissl staining of the spinal cord anterior horn neurons in 4 groups
  4 weeks after SCI (n = 6, scale bar = 100 µm); statistical analysis was used to
  evaluate survival. (E,F) TUNEL staining was used to evaluate the programmed cell
  death 3 days after SCI in each group (n = 6, scale bar = 100 µm). (G,H) TEM was
  used to observe the damage degree of mitochondria in the spinal cord tissue of mice
  and statistically analyze the vacuolation rate of mitochondria in the spinal cord
  of all 4 groups (n = 6, scale bar = 2µm; 500 nm). Data are shown as the means ±
  SD; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
