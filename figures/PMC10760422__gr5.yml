caption: OSM suppresses HBV replication through the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. (A)
  Extracts from HepG2.2.15 cells treated with OSM (20 ng/mL) for 0∼60 minutes were
  analyzed for STAT activation. (B) HepG2.2.15 cells were pretreated with ruxolitinib
  (1 μM) and the AG490 (10 μM) for 1 hour and then were treated with OSM (20 ng/mL)
  for 10 minutes. The phosphorylation levels of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 were examined
  by immunoblotting. (C, E) The supernatant HBsAg and HBV DNA levels were examined
  in the indicated groups. One-way analysis of variance. (D) The inhibition effects
  of OSM on intracellular HBV RNAs and HBV antigens were analyzed in HepG2.2.15 cells
  pretreated with or without ruxolitinib. Inhibition ratios of OSM for intracellular
  pgRNA and total RNA for the indicated cell lines were calculated as (1 - OSM-treatment/sham-treatment) ×100.
  Relative gray values of HBsAg and HBcAg were analyzed by Image J and normalized
  to β-actin. Unpaired t test. (F) The expression levels of IRFs in HepG2.2.15 cells
  treated with OSM were examined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting.
  Unpaired t test. (G) STAT1-IRF9 heterodimer formation was examined by coimmunoprecipitation
  in Huh7-1.3 cells treated with OSM. ∗P < .05, ∗∗P < .01, and ∗∗∗P < .001.
