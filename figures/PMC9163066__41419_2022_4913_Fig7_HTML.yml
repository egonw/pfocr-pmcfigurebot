  axis
caption: A The relative expression of LIF was measured by qRT-PCR after knockdown
  or overexpression of circSCAF8 in PC3 and 22RV1 cells. B The relative expression
  of LIF was detected in 30 PCa tissues and 30 benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues
  by qRT-PCR. C Pearson correlation analyses showed that the expression level of circSCAF8
  was positively correlated with that of LIF. D, F Knockdown of circSCAF8 lead to
  the decrease of LIF and its downstream signaling pathway proteins (p-STAT3, MMP-2,
  MMP-9, VEGFA, and CyclinD1), while overexpression of circSCAF8 had an opposite effect.
  E, G miR-140-3p/miR-335 inhibitors or mimics could partially reverse the effects
  of circSCAF8 on LIF and its downstream signaling pathway proteins (p-STAT3, MMP-2,
  MMP-9, VEGFA, and CyclinD1). Error bars represent the SD of three independent experiments.
