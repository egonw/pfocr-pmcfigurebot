caption: Antagonizing miR-18a-5p in PCa cells inhibited osteogenic differentiation
  and osteoblastic lesions. CS, PCa cells without intervention; Control, PCa cells
  with empty virus; Inhibition, PCa cells with miR-18a-5p inhibition; NC, Equal volume
  PBS. Osteogenic-induced MC3T3-E1 cells cocultured with PCa cells supernatant. (A)
  Osteogenic-induced 7 d, the expression of osteogenic differentiation marker proteins.
  PCa cells were C4-2B. (B) Osteogenic-induced 14 d, ALP staining. (PCa cells were
  C4-2B or PC-3). (C) Osteogenic-induced 21 d, Alizarin red S staining. (PCa cells
  were C4-2B or PC-3). (D–I) After 4 weeks of C4-2B implantation, the tibia specimens
  of PCa bone metastasis nude mice model. (D) PSA Immunohistochemistry (brown represents
  positive). (E) Representative 3D-reconstruction images of tibia. (F) BMD analysis.
  (G) BV/TV analysis. (H) HE, Sirius red (red represents bone) and Masson staining
  (blue represents bone). (I) TRAP staining (purple represents positive). (J, K) After
  4 weeks of PC-3 implantation, the tibia specimens of PCa bone metastasis nude mice
  model. (J) Representative 3D-reconstruction images of tibia. (K) TRAP staining (purple
  represents positive). The data are represented as mean ± SEM or SD. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001, ns P > 0.05. The dotted green line indicates a range of 5%, which
  was considered to be normal.
