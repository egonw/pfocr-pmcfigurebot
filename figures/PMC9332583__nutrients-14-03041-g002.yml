caption: LPS-induced inflammation in HT29 cells ameliorated by R. intestinalis and
  flagellin of R. intestinalis. (A) Colonic epithelial cells with the TLR5 receptor
  recognize R. intestinalis flagellin and secrete the anti-inflammatory factors IL-10
  and TGF-β. RT–qPCR and ELISA analysis of IL-10 (B) and TGF-β (C) mRNA and protein
  levels in the control, LPS, R. I, and LPS + R. I treated HT29 cells. RT–qPCR and
  ELISA analysis of IL-10 (D) and TGF-β (E) mRNA and protein levels in control, LPS,
  flagellin, and LPS + R. I flagellin treated HT29 cells. The results are presented
  as the mean ± SD of three replicates; * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01.
