caption: Toxic effects of heavy metals on physiological, biochemical, and molecular
  properties of the plant. Heavy metals activate several signaling pathways in plant
  cells. Activation of the calcium signaling pathway and ROS and hormones and MAPKs
  cause the expression of genes responding to heavy metal stress. Phytohormone levels
  in the cell change with the production of ROS in the presence of heavy metals.
