figure_title: Fold change of KYN metabolites by BMI categories
caption: 'The body mass index (BMI)-for-age Z scores of the children were determined
  using local BMI-for-age percentile charts for boys and girls (https://www.healthhub.sg/livehealthy/745/differencesbetweenchildandadultbmi,
  last accessed 10 August 2021). Children with BMI-for-age < -1 Z-scores were classified
  as underweight, while children with BMI-for-age > +1 Z-scores were classified as
  overweight and children with BMI-for-age > +2 Z-scores were classified as obese.
  The fold increase in KYN metabolite was calculated by taking the average concentration
  for the children in the normal weight category as 1 and calculating the fold change
  by dividing the average concentration at the underweight, overweight or obese BMI
  categories by the average concentration at the normal weight category. TRP: solid
  diamond, KYN: solid square, KA: solid triangle, HK: solid circle, XA: open square,
  HAA: open circle, QA: open triangle.'
