caption: HNF1A-AS1-mediated chemoresistance and radioresistance in cancers. HNF1A-AS1
  increases 5-FU resistance in the gastric cancer HGC-27 and MKN-45 by sponging miR-30b-5p
  and upregulating EIF5A2. HNF1A-AS1 also enhances TAM resistance in breast cancer
  cell lines MCF-7 and BTF474 via reducing miR-363 and promoting SERTAD3 expression
  to activate the TGF-Î²/Smad pathway. In-lung cancer cells, HNF1A-AS1 strengthened
  radiotherapy resistance of A549 and Calu-1 cells by modulating the miR-92a-3p/MAP2K4/JNK
  pathway.
