caption: Isoginkgetin activates Nrf2 signaling pathway via inhibiting ubiquitin dependent
  proteasomal degradation. (A) The neonatal cardiomyocytes were stimulated with PA
  (400 μM) for 24 h with IGK (10 μM) or the vehicle. Then the mRNA expression of Nrf2
  was detected by qPCR, n = 3. (B and C) The neonatal cardiomyocytes were treated
  with IGK (10 μΜ) for 1 h followed by incubation with CHX (300 μM) for indicated
  times respectively. The expression of Nrf2 was determined by Western blot, n = 3.
  (D) Gene ontology analysis of differentially upregulated genes in IGK-treated obese
  mice by RNA-seq. (E) The neonatal cardiomyocytes were treated with IGK (10 μM) or
  the vehicle in the presence or absence of MG132 (10 μM) for 2 h. Representative
  images of immunoblot analysis of total Nrf2 protein levels and total K48 ubiquitinated
  proteins levels. n = 3 independent experiments. (F) The neonatal cardiomyocytes
  were treated with IGK (10 μM) or the vehicle in the presence or absence of MG132
  (10 μM) for 2 h. Representative images of immunoprecipitation assay showing that
  Nrf2 interacted with ubiquitin-K48 in cells. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated
  with ubiquitin-K48 antibody, and then analyzed by immunoblotting. Input was used
  as a positive control and IgG was used as a negative control. Data were presented
  as mean ± SD, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 vs. Vehicle group. Data were analyzed by
  Student's t-test.
