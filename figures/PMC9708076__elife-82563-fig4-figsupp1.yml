caption: (A and B) The strains above were grown overnight in yeast peptone dextrose
  (YPD), serially diluted, and spotted onto the indicated solid media. YPD +2% congo
  red was used to assay cell wall stress tolerance. YPD +1 μg/mL FK506 was used to
  assay growth under calcineurin inhibition. YPD +4 mM H2O2 was used to assay oxidative
  stress tolerance. L-DOPA media was used to assay melaninization. RPMI media buffered
  with MOPS(3-(N-Morpholino)propanesulfonate) was used to test tolerance to 37°C or
  37°C+5% CO2 at pH 6 and pH 7.4. Photographs were taken 2 days of incubation. Christensen
  Urea Agar was used to assay urease activity, indicated by change in media coloration
  from yellow to pink. (C) The cells incubated for 2 days on RPMI pH 7.4, 37°C+5%
  CO2, were stained with India Ink and observed under the microscope to check capsule
  size. (D) Cells were grown overnight in liquid culture and then diluted to the concentration
  of OD600=0.01. Equal volumes of the indicated MATa and MATα cells were mixed, and
  3 μL was spotted onto V8 pH 5.0 solid medium. After incubation at 22°C for 2 weeks
  in the dark, mating colonies were examined with a SZX16 stereoscope (Olympus).
