figure_title: nck-1 works independently of MAPK signaling
caption: (A) hsp-4::gfp C. elegans were grown to the L4 stage on the indicated RNAi
  bacteria and transferred to E. coli plates expressing empty vector or Cry5B for
  8 hours, then subjected to fluorescence microscopy. Scale bar = 0.1mm. (B) sek-1(km4)
  p38 MAPKK(-) mutant C. elegans were grown on the indicated RNAi bacteria to the
  L4 stage and then transferred to liquid culture with varying amounts of purified
  Cry5B and incubated for 6 days before being scored for survival. pmk-1 is p38 MAPK.
  (C) The reverse experiment to the one in (B), with nck-1(ok694) mutant animals and
  RNAi of MAPK pathway genes at a single concentration of Cry5B. For (B) and (C),
  each data point is the average of three independent experiments with three wells/experiment
  (n = 20â€“33 worms/well).
