caption: ICT inhibits PLK1 and activates DDR pathway in vivo(A) Representative IHC
  images of tumor tissues from control, 30, 60, and 120 mg/kg of ICT mice group (left)
  and the quantification of IHC results (right). (B) Tumor tissue extracts (120 mg/kg
  of ICT group and control group) were subjected to western blot using the indicated
  antibodies (n = 6/group). GAPDH was used as a loading control (left). (Right) Densitometric
  analysis of the western blot. ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01. Scale bar, 20 μm.
