caption: 'Effects on muscle fiber structure and development of both wildtype and mutant
  hMYOT and hCRYAB genes. (A). Birefringence analysis of zebrafish embryos at 48 hpf.
  Left panels in (A) show representative birefringence images of embryos for each
  analyzed condition. Scale bar is 200 μm. Total number of embryos analyzed for each
  condition: not injected wildtype embryos (n = 199), injected embryos with hMYOT
  WT (n = 35), hMYOT S95I (n = 41), hCRYAB WT (n = 87), hCRYAB G154S (n = 92). Right
  panel in (A) shows the bar graph reporting the percentage of birefringence phenotypes
  for each analyzed condition. By considering 100% as the total number of embryos
  analyzed for each condition, the white open bars represent the percentage of embryos
  with normal birefringence phenotype, while the closed black bars represent the percentage
  of severe birefringence phenotype. Three independent experiments have been performed.
  (B). The involvement of BMP signaling pathway in muscle structure development was
  evaluated by checking GFP fluorescence of Tg(BMPRE:EGFP)ia18 zebrafish embryos at
  48hpf not injected (n = 127) or injected with hMYOT WT (n = 32), hMYOT S95I (n =
  57), hCRYAB WT (n = 68), hCRYAB G154S (n = 98). Left panels in (B) show representative
  images of fluorescent embryos for each analyzed condition. Scale bar is 200 μM.
  Right panel in (B) shows the bar graph reporting the integrated density of fluorescent
  pixel area in the trunk region ± s.e.m. Four independent experiments were performed.
