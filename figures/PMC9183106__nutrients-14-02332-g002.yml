caption: 'NOB attenuated hypoxia and apoptosis of rat placental cells caused by RUPP.
  (A) The HIF1α mRNA and protein levels of the placenta were tested using an RT-qPCR
  and a rat HIF1α ELISA kit, respectively. The LDH activity and CS activity of the
  placenta were estimated using an LDH kit and a rat CS ELISA kit, respectively. (B)
  Representative pictures of placental histology of H&E staining in a similar place
  in the cross-cut dimension, as well as the placental thickness, placental area,
  junctional zone area, labyrinth zone area, and the ratio of the placental junction
  area to the labyrinth area. (C) Representative pictures of DNA fragmentation in
  the placenta of pregnant rats by TUNEL staining in a similar place in the cross-cut
  dimension. (D) The protein expression of cl-PARP in the placental lysate was detected
  by Western blot and the relative expression levels were quantified. ACTB was used
  as an internal control, and the relative protein expression was the ratio of the
  target protein to ACTB. Data are expressed as the mean ± standard error (Mean ±
  SEM). a: comparing with the control groups, p < 0.05; b: comparing with the NOB
  groups, p < 0.05; c: comparing with the hypoxia groups, p < 0.05.'
