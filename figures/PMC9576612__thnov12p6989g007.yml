caption: CHI3L1 interacts with CD44 to drive M2 TAMs polarization. (A-B) Western blot
  of CHI3L1, p65, and ACTN4 expression after TNFɑ treatment in U87MG and A172 cells,
  which were pretreated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), CB, (-)-B, PF, and Y. (C-D)
  Cytoplasmic and nuclear CHI3L1, p65, and ACTN4 were analyzed using western blot.
  (E) mRNA expression levels of CHI3L1 between the control and CB pretreated group
  in U87MG and A172 cell lines. (F) Co-immunofluorescent staining of CHI3L1 and CD206
  in frozen sections of human gliomas. (G-H) Macrophages derived from THP1 induced
  by PMA (10 ng/mL) for 24 h, and identified by morphologic evaluation and mRNA expression
  of CD68. (I) M2 markers (CD206 and CD163) expression in macrophages treated with
  IL-4 (100 ng/mL), rhCHI3L1 (500 ng/mL), and the culture supernatant (cs) of U87MG
  and A172 cells measured by IF. (J-K) mRNA expression of M1 and M2 markers quantitated
  by qRT-PCR in macrophages treated with IL4, and the culture supernatant of U87MG
  and A172 cells. (L-N) Migration of U118MG cells induced by M2 macrophages. (O-V)
  mRNA expression of M1 and M2 markers in Cd44+/+ and Cd44-/- BMDMs treated with IL-4
  and rmCHI3L1 (500 ng/mL). (W) Western blot of phosphorylation of AKT and p38 in
  Cd44+/+ and Cd44-/- BMDMs pretreated with rmCHI3L1.
