caption: Expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, and NF-κB as detected by western blot after 24 hours
  of treatment of EELDP. (A, D, and G) are western blots of MMP-2, -9, and NF-κB in
  A549, HeLa, and U2OS cells respectively. Expression of MMP-2, -9 in cells is represented
  by (lysate) whereas the secreted MMP-2, -9 in culture media are denoted as (medium).
  The lower-most panel of each blot shows the internal control β-actin. Here, 0.0
  denotes untreated control. 0.1, 0.3, 0.6 represents the concentration of EELDP 0.1,
  0.3, and 0.6 mg/ml respectively. The % of MMPs expressions is presented graphically
  by taking the control expression as 100%. (B and C) for A549, (E and F) for HeLa,
  and (H) for U2OS cell lines. Each bar represents the mean with the standard deviation
  of MMPs expression obtained from 3 independent experiments. Here “*” defines 0.01 < P ≤ 0.05,
  “**” defines 0.001 < P ≤ 0.01, and “***” defines P ≤ 0.001.
