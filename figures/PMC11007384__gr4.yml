caption: Genetic characterization of momB1, B2 and B3. The role of momB2 is determined
  as a positive regulatory and momB3 as a negative regulatory gene for MOMA biosynthesis.
  a) LC-MS analysis (extracted ion chromatograms of m/z [M − H]- 1299.6 corresponding
  to MOMA) of Streptomyces sp. (CMB-M0244) wild type (indicated with WT) and mutants
  (MU02B1, MU03B1, MU02B2, MU02B3, and MU03B3). b) Relative yield of MOMA production
  in various mutant strains compared to the wild type (WT), which is 1.3 mg L−1. The
  yield was determined by analyzing the integrated peak area of extracted ion chromatograms
  corresponding to MOMA, where MOMA peak area in the wild type is normalized to 1.
  The synergic strain MU03B3::momB2 has the highest yield of MOMA, nearly 2.6 fold
  increase times greater than the wild type. The replication number is three.
