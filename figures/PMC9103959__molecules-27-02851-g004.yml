caption: Effects of the isolated compounds on TNF-α (A), IL-6 (B), and PGE2 (C) in
  LPS-stimulated BV2 cells. Cells were pretreated for 3 h with indicated concentrations
  of compounds 1–4 and stimulated for 24 h with LPS (0.5 μg/mL). Bars represent means
  ± standard deviation of three independent experiments. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001 compared with LPS-treated group.
