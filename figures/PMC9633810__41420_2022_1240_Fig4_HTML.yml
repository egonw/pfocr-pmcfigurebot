figure_title: Reduction in FRG1 increases EMT via activation of the ERK pathway
caption: FRG1 level was depleted in MCF7 (FRG1_KD) and elevated in MDA-MB-231 (FRG1_Ex)
  cells, and, subject to immunoblotting for EMT markers snail, slug, and twist to
  assess the effect of FRG1 expression modulation in EMT signaling. A Western blots
  show the effect of reduced FRG1 expression (FRG1_KD) on the levels of snail, slug,
  and twist. Corresponding bar graphs show the difference in expression between the
  FRG1_KD and Control_Sc groups. B MCF7_FRG1_KD cells were treated with 10 μM of ERK
  inhibitor FR180204 (FRG1_KD + FR180204) and DMSO (FRG1_KD + DMSO) for 2 h. The upper
  blot validates the reduction in the pERK level. Snail levels were examined in the
  FRG1_KD + FR180204 group compared to the FRG1_KD + DMSO group. C Representative
  images illustrate the difference in wound healing in the same set (as B). Scale
  bar, 100 μm. The bar graph shows the percentage of wound healing in MCF7_FRG1_KD + FR180204,
  MCF7_FRG1_KD + DMSO, and untreated Control_Sc groups. D Expression of EMT markers
  snail, slug, and twist were measured by immunoblots in MDA-MB-231 cells with ectopic
  expression of FRG1 (FRG1_Ex) versus control (Control_Ev). E MDA-MB-231 cells with
  elevated FRG1 level (FRG1_Ex) were treated with 5 μM of ERK activator Ceramide (FRG1_Ex + Ceramide)
  and DMSO (FRG1_Ex+DMSO) for 30 min. The uppermost blot validates the activation
  of ERK in MDA-MB-231_FRG1_Ex cells due to the administration of Ceramide. Rescue
  in snail level was measured by Western blot. F Rescue in cell migration was measured
  by wound-healing assay in MDA-MB-231_FRG1_Ex+Ceramide compared to MDA-MB-231_FRG1_Ex + DMSO
  group, along with Control_Sc. Scale bar, 100 μm. The bar diagram demonstrates the
  difference in the percentage of wound closure between MDA-MB-231_FRG1_Ex + DMSO
  and MDA-MB-231_FRG1_Ex + Ceramide groups. G Bar graph shows the effect of FRG1 reduction
  (FRG1_KD) on fold change in mRNA levels of GM-CSF, PDGFβ, PDGFα, CXCL1, and CXCL8
  compared to Control_Sc as determined by qRT-PCR in MCF7 cells. H Bar graph of ELISA
  shows the difference in the level of GM-CSF due to FRG1 depletion (FRG1_KD) compared
  to the control (Control_Sc) in MCF7 cell line. I shows the effect of increased FRG1
  expression (FRG1_Ex) in MDA-MB-231_Ex cells on the transcript levels of genes same
  as G. J Bar diagram depicts the difference in GM-CSF level due to ectopic expression
  of GM-CSF in MDA-MB-231 cell line. K MCF7_FRG1_KD cells were treated with CXCR2
  inhibitor Cpd 19 (FRG1_KD + Cpd 19) and DMSO (FRG1_KD + DMSO) for 2 h. Western blots
  and graphical representation show its effect on the levels of pERK and snail in
  MCF7_FRG1_KD + DMSO, FRG1_KD + Cpd 19, and Control_Sc groups. GAPDH was used as
  internal control both for immunoblots and qRT-PCR. Shown results are representative
  of three independent experiments. Result values show mean ± SD value. Two-tailed
  unpaired student’s t-test was used to compare the difference between the two groups.
