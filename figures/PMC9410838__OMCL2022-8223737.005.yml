caption: 'MT reduces ferroptosis in DEX-induced BMSCs by activating the PI3K-AKT-mTOR
  pathway. (a–d) Western blot results for the expressions of PI3K-p85, p-AKT, AKT,
  p-mTOR, and mTOR were pretreated with various concentrations of MT for 24 h; DEX
  (10−3 M) was then added for 24 h. (e) Images of immunofluorescence staining of PI3K
  in BMSCs. (f) Quantification of the fluorescence intensity of PI3K immunofluorescence
  positively stained cells. These studies were performed at least 3 biological replicates.
  Data represent mean ± SD (n = 3). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.005 compared with
  control group. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.005 compared with DEX group.'
