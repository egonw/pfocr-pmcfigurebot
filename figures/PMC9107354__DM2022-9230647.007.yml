caption: 'Graphical abstract: TGF-β signaling mediates EMT. (a) TGF-β is an important
  player in the activation of EMT, which is characterized by downregulation of epithelial
  markers and upregulation of mesenchymal markers. TGF-β via either Smad or non-Smad
  signaling can promote EMT. The polyhedral fibroblasts were replaced by typical cobblestone
  like epithelioid cells when EMT takes place. The certain radiation of gamma-ray
  dose from I-125 seed increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in almost
  tested cells, which shows downregulation of TGF-β1, Smad2, Snail, N-cadherin, and
  vimentin in our tested cells by RT-PCR and WB assay. Inhibition of the TGF-β1/Smad
  signaling pathway causes the inhibition of invasion and metastasis. The diagram
  has been partly adapted from the concepts of ref. , .'
