caption: 'Knockdown of Faim inhibited the effects of PACAP on decreasing lipid accumulation
  and activating AMPK-IRβ signaling pathway. AML12 cells were transiently transfected
  with Faim siRNA or scramble siRNA in cell culture medium containing 200 μM PA or
  10% BSA (as control of PA solution) for 24 h, then the cells were treated with PACAP
  (1 μM) and Max.D.4 (10 μM) for another 24 h as indicated. (A) Representative for
  Oil Red O staining of AML12 (Scale bars, 50 μM). (B and C) Impacts of Faim knockdown
  on cellular TG and TC level (B), glucose uptake and glycogen content (C) of AML12.
  (D and E) Faim knockdown impaired the activation of AMPK-IRβ pathway in AML12 treated
  with PACAP, the protein levels were analyzed by western blot and quantitative measurements
  (right). (F and G) AML12 were exposed to PA for 24 h, then treated with PACAP (1 μM),
  Max.D.4 (10 μM) and Compound C (10 μM) (F) or AICAR (0.5 mM) (G) for another 24 h.
  The protein level of FAIM was detected by western blot analysis and quantitative
  measurements (down). Data are presented as mean ± SEM. n = 3 (&P < 0.05, &&P < 0.01,
  &&&P < 0.001 vs. control group; ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. PA group;
  #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001 vs. PA + PACAP group, △P < 0.05, △△P < 0.01,
  △△△P < 0.001 vs. PA + PACAP + Max.D.4 group).'
