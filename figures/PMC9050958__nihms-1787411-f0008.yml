caption: A model of the transcriptional and post-translational control of melanogenesis
  in melanocytes. The transcriptional control of melanogenesis is known to be mainly
  mediated through the αMSH, WNT, and KITLG pathways. This study has identified IFNG-JAK-STAT1
  pathway as a novel regulator of the post-translational control. The depiction of
  the signaling pathways has been simplified for clarity. KITLG, KIT ligand (SCF);
  KIT, Kit receptor tyrosine kinase; WNT, Wingless-type MMTV integration site family;
  FZD, Frizzled receptor; αMSH, alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone; MC1R, melanocortin
  receptor; ERK, Extracellular signal-regulated kinase; CREB, CAMP responsive element
  binding protein; MITF, melanocyte inducing transcription factor; TYR, Tyrosinase;
  TYRP1, Tyrosinase related protein 1; DCT, Dopachrome tautomerase; IFNG, interferon-gamma;
  IFNGR, Interferon-gamma receptor; JAK, Janus kinase; STAT1, Signal transducer and
  activator of transcription 1. Nu, nucleus; PM, plasma membrane; Ms, melanosome;
  Ub, ubiquitin; G, N-linked glycosylation; P, phosphorylation.
