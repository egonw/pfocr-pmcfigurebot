caption: RA signaling ablation modulates Treg transcriptional programs by promoting
  mTORC1 signaling and metabolic fitness. Tregs were FACS sorted from Foxp3YFP-Cre
  (WT) and female DNRARαlsl/lsl mice heterozygous for Foxp3YFP-Cre (DNRAR Tregs).
  Sorted Tregs were activated overnight with anti-CD3/CD28 mAbs in the presence of
  IL-2. A PCA plots analysis of the RNA-Seq data sets for all samples. Samples are
  color-coded by experimental group and each dot represents an RNA sample from a single
  mouse. B Network diagram of pathway terms from the Hallmark gene set enriched in
  DE gene list. The coloration is based on adjusted p-value significance, and direction.
  The color indicates which direction the gene set is enriched in, blue is more WT,
  and red is more DNRAR. C Heatmap of differentially expressed genes in key nodes
  of the GSEA network map in (B). D GSEA barcode plot of IL2-STAT5 signaling node.
  E Heatmap of transcription factors in the IL2-STAT5 signaling node. F Ingenuity
  pathway analysis (IPA) of the genes involved in DNRAR Treg phenotype. G, H Integrating
  of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analysis to identify RARα direct target genes. G Heat map
  of genes DE between DNRAR and WT Tregs at a level of an FDR of <0.05 and absolute
  fold change >2. On the left is an additional annotation - ‘RAR_peak’, which shows
  those genes in red that had a RAR ChIPseq peak (in WT mice) within the transcription
  start site (TSS). H Results of pathway enrichment using a hypergeometric test of
  those genes that were both overrepresented in DNRAR by mRNA and had RAR peaks at
  TSSs in a universe of all expressed genes in Tregs
