caption: 'SOD2 loss lowers the NADPH/NADP+ ratio following β-Lapachone treatment.(A)
  NADPH:NADP+ ratio measurement. A549 cells expressing control or SOD2 sgRNAs were
  treated with DMSO or the indicated concentration of β-Lapachone for 2 h prior to
  collection. The NADPH:NADP+ ratios were normalized to control DMSO treated cells.(B)
  Left, tracer strategy for the analysis of pentose phosphate pathway flux using [1,2–13C]
  glucose. Dark blue circles depict glycolytic metabolites produced exclusively by
  glycolysis (M+2 labeling); orange circles depict glycolytic intermediates arising
  from glucose that first passed through the oxPPP (M+1) (adapted from Ref. []). Right,
  M+0 (unlabeled), M+1 (PPP-derived) and M+2 (glycolysis derived) labeling of lactate
  from [1,2–13C] glucose (mean + SD; n = 3). A549 cells expressing either control
  or SOD2 sgRNAs were treated with DMSO or 2 μM β-Lapachone for 1.5 h before metabolite
  extraction. See also  (A–B).(C) Representative redox immunoblot analysis of the
  oxidation state of PRDX1 in A549 cells expressing either control sgRNA or sgRNAs
  targeting SOD2. Cells were treated with DMSO, 2 μM β-Lapachone or 6 μM Auranofin
  for 2 h. HSP90 was the loading control.(D) DNA damage assessment of A549 cells expressing
  either control sgRNA or sgRNAs targeting SOD2. Cells were exposed to escalating
  concentrations of β-Lapachone for 2 h. Protein levels of SOD2, HSP90 (loading control),
  total H2AX (loading control) and the DNA damage marker γ-H2AX (pS139) were assessed
  by Western blotting.(E) Model: SOD2 deficient cells have impaired mitochondrial
  function following β-Lapachone treatment, resulting in both depletion of NADPH and
  failure to maintain ATP levels. NADPH depletion impairs β-Lapachone-induced ROS
  detoxification, leading to more DNA damage and enhanced cytotoxicity. (For interpretation
  of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
  Web version of this article.)'
