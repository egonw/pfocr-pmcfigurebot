caption: 'Involvement of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase
  (NOX) in the suramin-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Cells were
  treated with 0 to 10 μM suramin for various time periods as indicated. Then, the
  cells were further incubated with 100 μM dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate
  (DCFH-DA) for 30 minutes before detection of the fluorescence by fluorescence microscopy
  (magnification: 100×) (a, b, left panel) or by flow cytometry (d, left panel). c)
  Cells were pretreated with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) (c), rotenone (c), and diphenyleneiodonium
  chloride (DPI) (c, d) or vehicle, followed by treatment with 10 μM suramin for 30
  minutes. Then, the cells were further incubated with 100 μM DCFH-DA for 30 minutes
  before detection of the fluorescence by fluorescence microscopy or by flow cytometry
  (a to d, f). Results are expressed as mean values; ###p < 0.001 compared to vehicle
  control and ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05 compared to suramin treatment alone.
  e) Cells were treated with 10 μM suramin for various time periods as indicated to
  measure their NOX activity, as described in the Methods section. f) Bar diagram
  showing quantitative data of 2'',7''-dichlorofluorescein-positive cells.'
