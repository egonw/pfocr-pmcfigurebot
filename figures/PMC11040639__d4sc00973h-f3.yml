figure_title: (a) Reaction pathway where each monochlorotriazine on the resin reacts
  with a molecule of piperazine from solution, leading to the product that propagates
  chain growth. (b) Reaction pathway where one equivalent of piperazine reacts with
  two monochlorotriazines on the same resin bead leading to the cross-product, which
  terminates chain growth
