caption: Quantitative DIA-SWATH/MS analysis of protein content in EVs secreted by
  brown adipose tissue (BAT) in normal (control) and obese animals. (A) A volcano
  plot representation of elevated proteins in BAT EVs from lean versus obese animals
  with a fold change >1.5; (B) cluster analysis by heat map representation of proteins
  in BAT EVs with a fold change ≥2 and p-values ≤ 0.05; (C) summary table with elevated
  proteins in EVs released from BAT of obese animals; (D) classification of the comparative
  functional enrichment (FunRich basis) according to cellular component, process,
  and biological pathway of the elevated proteins in BAT EVs from normal (grey) and
  obese (orange) animals.
