caption: 'Amifostine (AMI) reduces bleomycin (BLM)-induced epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT) and extracellular matrix (ECM) changes. (a) Western blot detection
  results of E-cadherin, N-cadherin and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression in
  lung tissue. (b) Western blot density analysis. (c) Immunohistochemical staining
  of type I collagen in lung tissue (magnification × 100 and × 200). Data are expressed
  as mean ± SD (n = 6). ⁎⁎P < 0.01 versus the control group. ##P < 0.01 and #P < 0.05
  versus the model group. &&P < 0.01 and &P < 0.05 versus the AMI 200-mg/kg group.'
article_title: Amifostine attenuates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice
  through inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.
