caption: ATP13A1 positively regulates RIG‐I‐MAVS signaling pathway. A) qPCR and ELISA
  analysis for the induction and expression of IFNB in wild‐type or ATP13A1 −/− HEK293T
  cells with various stimuli as indicated. vRNA refers to genomic RNA isolated from
  VSV. B) Induction of CCL5, CXCL10 and ISG54 in wild‐type and ATP13A1 −/− HEK293T
  cells with or without SeV infection. C) Immunoblotting analysis of cell lysates
  from wild‐type or ATP13A1 −/− HEK293T cells with VSV infection for the indicated
  time. D) Wild‐type or ATP13A1 −/− HEK293T cells were infected with VSV‐GFP (MOI
  = 0.1) for 12 h before microscopic imaging (left) and plaque assay (right). E) qPCR
  analysis for the transcription of IFNB in wild‐type and ATP13A1‐knockdown HEK293T
  cells with various stimuli as indicated. F) qPCR and ELISA analysis for the transcription
  and expression of Ifnb in wild‐type and Atp13a1 −/− MEF cells with various stimuli
  as indicated. G) Wild‐type or Atp13a1 −/− MEF cells were infected with VSV‐GFP (MOI = 0.1)
  for 12 h before microscopic imaging (left) and plaque assay (right). H) Immunoblotting
  analysis for FLAG‐ATP13A1 expression in ATP13A1 −/‐ HEK293T cells. Asterisk indicated
  nonspecific bands. I) qPCR analysis for the induction of IFNB in HEK293T cells following
  transient expression of the indicated plasmids. Data are representative of three
  independent experiments (shown as mean and SD in (A,B,D–G,I)). p value was determined
  by two‐tailed unpaired Student's t‐test, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.
  ns indicates not statistically significant.
