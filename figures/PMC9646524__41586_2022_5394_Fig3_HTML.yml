figure_title: TRPV4-mediated activation of RHOA–ROCK–myosin II contractility
caption: a, The lifetimes of the RHOA activity biosensor in MDA-MB-231 cells on a
  2D surface at the indicated viscosities. b, The subcellular distribution of RHOA
  activity in n ≥ 30 cells on a 2D surface from 4 experiments. c, RHOA activity in
  SC and shTRPV4 MDA-MB-231 cells (n ≥ 21) on a 2D surface from 3 experiments. d,
  Confocal images of GFP–AHD-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells in confinement. The red arrowheads
  indicate regions of active RHOA. e, GFP–AHD intensity in different segments of confined
  MDA-MB-231 cells (n ≥ 33) at 8 cP in the presence of vehicle control or NHE1 inhibitor
  from ≥3 experiments. f, GFP–AHD intensity in different segments of confined MDA-MB-231
  cells (n ≥ 33) after treatment with vehicle control or the TRPV4 inhibitor GSK 2193874
  (GSK2) from 3 experiments. The intensity in each segment was normalized to the mean
  intensity of the entire cell in e and f. g, Confocal images of MIIA–GFP-expressing
  and Lifeact–Ruby-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells migrating in confinement. The red arrowheads
  indicate regions of intense MIIA localization. h, The confined migration speeds
  of SC and MIIA and MIIB single- or double-knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells (n ≥ 38) from
  2 experiments. Data are mean ± s.d. i, Schematic of the proposed viscosity-sensing
  pathway. OEM, osmotic engine model. The schematic in i was created using Servier
  Medical Art. Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired t-tests (b), Kruskal–Wallis
  tests followed by Dunn’s test (c and h) and two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test
  (e and f). Scale bars, 20 µm (a, d and g).
