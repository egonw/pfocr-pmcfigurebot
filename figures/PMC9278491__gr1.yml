caption: Ex vivo compound screening pathway. Compounds representing 7 distinct chemical
  classes were evaluated in C. elegans, O. gutturosa, and O. lienalis. C. elegans
  assay observation period was 3 days–12 days. O. gutturosa, O. lienalis, B. malayi,
  and L. sigmodontis motility assays are measured over 5-days. Compounds showing <12 μM
  against O. gutturosa progressed to EC50 determination. Activity (EC50 values) in
  the micromolar (μM) range against adult parasites are considered positive hits.
  “Hit” compounds (<12 μM) were assessed and prioritized based on physical chemical
  properties and ADME. Secondary assays were performed on select compounds in B. malayi,
  and L. sigmodontis microfilariae and adult female filariae at 100 nM. Selected compounds
  were evaluated for oral exposure in vivo PK and were evaluated in mice that harboured
  adult worms of the rodent filarial nematode L. sigmodontis.
