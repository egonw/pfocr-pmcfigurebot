caption: 'Correlations of ATAXIC scores with the proliferation and differentiation
  signatures in cancer. Spearman correlations between ATAXIC scores and the enrichment
  scores of the proliferation signature (a), the cell cycle pathway (b), and the differentiation
  signature (c) in single cells from individual patients of eight cancer types. BC:
  breast cancer; GBM: gliomas; PC: prostate cancer; RCC: renal cell carcinoma; SyS12
  (pt): SyS12 post treatment. The Spearman correlation coefficients (p) and adjusted
  P values (FDR) are shown. ∗ FDR < 0.05, ∗∗ FDR < 0.01, ∗∗∗ FDR < 0.001, ns: not
  significant (this also applies to the following figures).'
