caption: 'Reduced number and cytotoxicity in blood NK cells from patients with AD.
  (A) tSNE plots of total PBMCs from controls and patients with AD. NK cells were
  labeled with ellipse tag, which were reduced in the AD group. (B) The distribution
  of cell clusters in AD and control groups. (C) NK cell percentage in individual
  level. Data are presented as means ± SEM. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. (D) Assessment
  of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using log-fold change expression versus
  the difference in the percentage of cells expressing the gene in blood NK cells
  from patients with AD versus controls (▲Percentage Difference). Genes labeled were
  chosen based on log-fold change > 1.5 (Up) and log-fold change < −0.5 (Down), adjusted p-value
  from Wilcoxon rank sum test < 0.05. (E) Violin plots show the expression levels
  of cytotoxicity and activation markers in blood NK cells from patients with AD versus
  controls. (F) KEGG pathway analysis of DEGs in blood NK cells from patients with
  AD versus controls. Blue: downregulated pathways, pink: upregulated pathways. (G)
  GO enrichment analysis of DEGs in NK cells.'
