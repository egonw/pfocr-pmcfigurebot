caption: Resveratrol modulates the arginine/proline metabolic pathway. A Hierarchical
  clustering heatmap of significantly differential metabolites in negative ion mode.
  B Hierarchical clustering heatmap of significantly differential metabolites in positive
  ion mode. C Differential metabolite network diagram between the RSV group and the
  DSS group in positive ion mode. D KEGG enrichment pathway diagram (bubble diagram).
  E Differential abundance score plot of all enriched metabolic pathways between the
  RSV group and the DSS group. F Clustering heatmap of differential metabolites in
  the KEGG pathway for arginine and proline metabolism between the DSS and the RSV
  groups. G KEGG pathway diagram of arginine and proline metabolism containing differential
  metabolites
