caption: 'Mechanisms of Protection and Pathogenesis. Dynamic cycling of O-GlcNAc plays
  numerous roles in regulating cellular homeostasis and the response to cellular injury
  (blue). In contrast, chronic elevation or depletion of O-GlcNAc resulting in aberrant
  O-GlcNAc cycling is associated with disease pathogenesis (grey), including cardiomyopathy.
  Proteins whose function is potentiated by O-GlcNAc are highlighted in green, whereas
  those whose function is inhibited are highlighted in red. Glycoproteins impacted
  by O-GlcNAc through ill-defined mechanisms are identified in black. Abbreviations
