caption: The Core Hippo Pathway. In the absence of Hippo-stimulating signals (left),
  the core Hippo kinase cascade is inactive and YAP/TAZ translocate into the nucleus
  to associate with TEAD family DNA binding proteins and co-activate transcriptional
  programs. In the presence of Hippo-stimulating signals (right), MST1/2 is phosphorylated
  and subsequently phosphorylates SAV1, LATS1/2, and MOB1A/B. In turn, LATS1/2 phosphorylates
  YAP/TAZ, resulting in YAP/TAZ cytoplasmic retention or proteolytic decay. Of note,
  Hippo-stimulating signals may bypass MST1/2 and directly activate LATS1/2.
