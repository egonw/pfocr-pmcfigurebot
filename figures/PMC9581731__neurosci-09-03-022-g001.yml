figure_title: Neuropeptide S (NPS) pathways in the rat brain. NPS is expressed in
  the brainstem and reaches the limbic system and anterior olfactory nucleus (AON).
  In the brainstem, NPS is synthesized in the peri-locus coeruleus (peri-LC) (blue
  squares). The link between the peri-LC and hypothalamic nuclei, e.g., the paraventricular
  nucleus (PVN), is a pathway that is involved in the expanded regulation of the limbic
  system and neuroendocrine response to stress, according to Nauta's conceptualization.
  The neuropeptide S receptors (NPSR) are localized in the ventral tegmental area,
  hypothalamic nuclei, amygdaloid complex, hippocampus and AON (red circles), according
  to previous studies ,
