figure_title: ASAP1 upregulated EGFR-MAPK pathway and promotes chemotherapy resistance
  by activating CDC42
caption: A The effect of ZCL278 on the viability of WT SGC-7901 cells in response
  to oxaliplatin. Cell viability was measured by CCK-8. IC50 values in two different
  drug treatments are shown (n = 3). B WB analysis of EGFR-MAPK pathway in SGC-7901
  cells expressing ASAP1-HA and partially knocked out of ASAP1. C Phalloidin staining
  for F-actin (red) and EBFR (green) immunofluorescence. Nuclei were counterstained
  with DAPI (blue). In ASAP1 ± SGC-7901 cells, the EGFR was not located on the membrane
  and the cytoskeleton depolymerized. In WT SGC-7901 cells treated with ZCL278, the
  EGFR was not located on the membrane and the cytoskeleton depolymerized. D The effect
  of IQGAP1 on the viability of SGC-7901-ASAP1 ± cells in response to oxaliplatin.
  Cell viability was measured by CCK-8. IC50 values in two different drug treatments
  are shown (n = 3). E The effect of EGFR on the viability of SGC-7901 cells expressing
  ASAP1-HA or not in response to oxaliplatin. Cell viability was measured by CCK-8.
  IC50 values in two different drug treatments are shown (n = 3). ns-not significant;
  *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001. F A working model of ASAP1 summarizing this
  study. ASAP1 was highly expressed in gastric cancer, inhibits ubiquitin-mediated
  degradation of IQGAP1 and promotes CDC42 activation through interaction with IQGAP1.
  Activated CDC42 contributes to the growth and metastasis of gastric cancer cells.
  In addition, activated CDC42 upregulates the EGFR pathway and causes oxaliplatin
  resistance in gastric cancer.
