caption: Modules showing the possible signaling pathways for UV-B- and ethylene-induced
  stomata closing. UV-B signaling in guard cells is initiated by the UV-B-specific
  signaling pathway UVR8-COP1-HY5 via induction of ethylene production. Ethylene is
  perceived by its receptor, ETR1, to inactivate the CTR1 kinase, releasing GCR1-dependent
  GPA1 activation. Then activated, GPA1 induces ROS and NO generation in guard cells
  and subsequent stomata closing. UV-B and ethylene maybe also activate GPA1 by inducing
  receptor-like kinases (RLKs)-phosphorylated GPA1 or by inhibiting RGS1-dependent
  deactivation of GPA1. Arrows and bars indicate induction and inhibition, respectively.
  The dashed line indicates a hypothetical cell response.
