caption: Mechanism of lncRNAs in the modulation of mastitis. Overexpression of lncRNA
  H19 promotes TGF-β1-induced EMT via PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Knockdown of lncRNA-TUB
  results in the downregulation of TUBA1C and the upregulation of TGF-β1, and the
  increased secretion of TGF-β1 activates the TGF-β1/Smad pathway, ultimately promoting
  EMT. LncRNA XIST mediates cell proliferation, viability, and apoptosis via generating
  a negative feedback regulation of NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. Downregulated
  LRRC75A-AS1 inhibits the NF-κB pathway by enhancing the expression of TJ protein,
  thereby alleviating the inflammatory response of MAC-T cells.
