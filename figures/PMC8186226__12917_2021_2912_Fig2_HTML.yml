caption: GO and KEGG functional enrichment of 16 heat-related DEGs. a The main annotated
  functions were associated with the endocrine system (PTGS2, NR4A2, MYL9, EDN1and
  ITGB3), the immunesystem (VEGF, IL1A, ITGB3, PTGS2, MYL9 and CXCL8) and signaling
  molecules and interaction(11 genes). b The enriched GO terms included the regulation
  of phosphorus metabolic process, response to oxygen levels, response to decreased
  oxygen levels, response to hypoxia and cytokine activity terms. c The enriched KEGG
  pathways included the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway, the VEGF signaling
  pathway, the TNF signaling pathway and the HIF-1 signaling pathway
