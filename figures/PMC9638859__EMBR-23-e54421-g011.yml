caption: 'A Immunofluorescence of NANOG in TNERT cells after 30 min treatment with
  or no OHT. Scale bars 5 μM.B (left) Schematic of Doxycycline inducible TDiN cell
  line, generated by the introduction of a Tetracycline inducible Flag‐Avi‐NANOG transgene
  in Tβc44Cre6 cell line. (Right) Western blot of NANOG in TDiN cells after 48 h treatment
  with or no Doxycycline.C FACS profiles of TNERT treatment with or no OHT in SLCHIR
  and SL2i. The dotted line represents the FACS profile of unstained E14Tg2a cells
  used as negative control (−ve c).D FACS profiles of TDiN cell line in SL, SLCHIR,
  2iL, SL2i, and SLPD. The dotted line represents the FACS profile of unstained E14Tg2a
  cells used as negative control (−ve c). (Bottom right) Nanog:GFP population median
  of TDiN in indicated treatments (n = 3).E Nanog:GFP population median of TNERT,
  and TDiN treated with SU5402, with OHT/Doxycycline or no OHT/Doxycycline.F (top)
  CRISPR‐based knock‐out strategy using paired sgRNA to knock‐out Fgf4 in TNERT. The
  sgRNAs are positioned at the beginning and the near end of exon II. The deletion
  results in the loss of the start codon and a part of the coding region in exon II.
  The dotted line represents the deleted region of the gene. FP and RP represent the
  relative positions of the genotyping primers. (Middle left) genotyping PCR of TNERTFgf4−/−
  clones. The WT allele gives an amplicon of 332 bp and the knock‐out allele has a
  smaller amplicon by 32 bps or more. (Middle right) The relative abundance of FGF4
  in media of TNERT and TNERTFgf4−/− clones 48 h after OHT treatment. (Bottom) Chromatogram
  of the TNERTFgf4−/− clones showing the sequences at the junction of the deletion.G
  (top) Schematic of the gene structure of Fgfbp1 and the relative positions of the
  two sgRNAs used for paired sgRNA knock‐out strategy. One sgRNA is complimentary
  to 5′UTR and the other to the 3′ end of the coding region of the only exon. (Middle
  left) Genotyping PCR showing a WT amplicon of 1,220 bps and an amplicon around 400 bps
  in case of deletion. (Middle right) The relative abundance of FGFBP1 in media of
  TNERT and TNERTFgfbp1−/− clones 48 h after OHT treatment. (Bottom) Chromatogram
  of the TNERTFgfbp1−/− clone showing the sequences at the junction of the deletion.H
  Strategy for knock‐out of Fgfr1 in TNERT cells. The schematic depicts the gene structure
  of Fgfr1 with the relative positions of the two sgRNAs. One sgRNA targets the 3′end
  of Intron 8 and the other exon10. (Middle left) Genotyping PCR shows a WT allele
  amplicon at 494 bp and a knock‐out allele with smaller amplicons around 150 bp.
  (Middle right) Western blot analysis of FGFR1 in TNERT and TNERTFgfr1−/− clones.
  (Bottom) chromatogram showing the sequence of the deleted region.I A paired sgRNA
  strategy to knock‐out Fgfr2 in TNERT. (Top) The schematic represents the Fgfr2 gene
  structure, with relative positions of the sgRNAs. One sgRNA target exon2 and the
  other sgRNA targets the coding region of the last exon approximately 100 kb apart.
  The dotted line represents the region of deletion in the Fgfr2 gene. (Middle left)
  PCR genotyping shows a 665 bp amplicon when at least one allele of Fgfr2 is deleted.
  This genotyping strategy cannot distinguish between +/− and −/− genotypes. (Middle
  right) Western blot analysis of FGFR2 protein in the Fgfr2 targeted clones distinguishing
  the +/− and −/− clones. (Bottom) chromatogram represents the sequence of the genotyping
  amplicon indicating the exact sites of deletion.Data information: n ≥ 3 biological
  replicates (each dot represents a biological replicate). Data are presented as mean ± SEM
  in D and E. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001 and ns = not significant (paired
  two‐tailed Student''s t‐test). Source data are available online for this figure.'
