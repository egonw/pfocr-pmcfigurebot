caption: Lollipop plot of pathway enrichment analysis by fast Gene Set Enrichment
  Analysis (fGSEA) where the pathways were customized by Guarnieri et al. []. The
  length of the stick is the degree of nominal enrichment score (NES). Grey means
  that it is not significantly enriched (p-value > 0.3), while red indicates upregulation,
  and blue indicates downregulation in solar lentigo (SL). ISR, integrated stress
  response; RAAS, Renin–Angiotensin–Aldosterone System; SL, solar lentigo.
