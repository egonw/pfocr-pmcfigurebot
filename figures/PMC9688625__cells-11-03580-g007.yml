caption: A proposed model of the function of the Wnt/β-catenin-MITF pathway in ferroptosis
  in melanoma. The activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling can promote the transcription
  of MITF, leading to the upregulation of downstream PGC1α and SCD1, so that the generation
  of lipid peroxidation is prominently suppressed and ultimately ferroptosis is inhibited.
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling deficiency exacerbates ferroptosis in melanoma via the regulation
  of MITF. This figure was produced by Figdraw.
