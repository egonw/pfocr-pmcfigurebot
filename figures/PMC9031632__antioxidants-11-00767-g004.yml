caption: TLR4 inhibition decreased BTZ-induced ER stress. (A) Western blot analysis
  of expression of ER stress protein markers (PERK, IRE1α, GPR78) in myeloma cell
  lines after drug treatments. GAPDH protein was used as total protein loading reference.
  For analysis, the optical density of the bands was measured using Scion Image software.
  (B) Relative mRNA expression of CHOP after drug treatments. Calculated value of
  2−∆∆Ct in untreated cells was 1. Data are expressed as mean MFI ± SEM of n ≥ 4 biological
  replicates; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001.
