figure_title: Analysis of morphology, proliferation and differentiation of DLL4 and
  PDGFBB‐treated hiMPs
caption: 'P value‐adjusted hierarchical clustering heatmap generated from a gene ontology
  list of genes involved in regulation of cell morphology (GO 0008360; P set at 0.05).Phase
  contrast images displaying morphology of untreated and treated hiMPs. Scale bar:
  25 μm.Scatter plot showing morphometric analysis of treated and untreated hiMPs.
  Morphology was quantified using the circularity ratio, where 1 = perfect circle
  and 0 = line (experimental replicates = 3). Statistical analysis (paired t‐test)
  was performed on the first quartile to enhance detection of morphological changes
  (error bars: SD). P value‐adjusted hierarchical clustering heatmap generated from
  a gene ontology list of genes involved in proliferation of stem and myogenic cell
  types (GO 2000291; 0048660; 0014857; 0072091; P set at 0.05).Immunofluorescence
  images of untreated and treated hiMPs incubated with EdU for 2 h. Scale bar: 75 μm.Bar
  graphs quantifying EdU experiment shown in (E) (experimental replicates = 3; error
  bars: SEM). Statistical analysis based on an unpaired t‐test. P value‐adjusted hierarchical
  clustering heatmap of NOTCH signalling genes (Kegg pathway 04330).Immunofluorescence
  images of hiMPs expanded in control or treated conditions for 1 week, induced to
  differentiate for 4 days in the presence or absence of γ‐secretase inhibitor L685458
  and immunostained for myosin heavy chain (MyHC). Scale bar: 75 μm.Bar graph quantifying
  the average percentage of nuclei within MyHC positive myotubes (experimental replicates = 3;
  error bars: SEM). Statistical significance based on one‐way ANOVA with Tukey''s
  multiple comparison. Scale bar: 75 μm.Immunofluorescence panels showing human specific
  LAMIN A/C+ (nuclei) and SPECTRIN (sarcolemma) staining in tibialis anterior muscles
  of immunodeficient mice (N = 3) transplanted with treated (n = 3 muscles) and untreated
  (n = 3 muscles) N5 hiMPs.Quantification of LAMIN A/C+ grafted human cells across
  each muscle. Data information: full gene list for heatmaps in (A) and (D) available
  in Appendix Table .  Source data are available online for this figure.'
