caption: Inhibition of APLN promoted cell proliferation in esophageal cancer cells.
  APLN was knocked down in TE-1 and ECA-109 cells using APLN siRNA. Then CCK-8 assay
  was used to determine cell proliferation in TE-1 (A) and ECA-109 cells (B) at 24,
  48, 72, and 96 h; *p<0.05 compared to scramble.
article_title: Inhibition of APLN suppresses cell proliferation and migration and
  promotes cell apoptosis in esophageal cancer cells in vitro, through activating
  PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway.
