figure_title: Metabolic / proteomic analysis of fatty-acid-related pathways in complex-IV-deficient
  livers
caption: (A) Left, volcano plot of identified proteins from the Fatty Acid Synthesis
  (GO:0006633) pathway, based on proteomics performed on Cox10-/- vs. Cox10f/f livers
  at 8 weeks post-AAV administration. Significantly up or downregulated proteins are
  indicated in black. Right, GSEA of pathway components; the normalized enrichment
  score (NES) and nominal p-value are indicated. (B) Same as (A), but for the Fatty
  Acid Oxidation (GO:0019395) pathway. (C) Schematic of fatty acid synthesis and oxidation
  pathways surrounding acyl-carnitine species. Metabolites are listed in lower case,
  proteins are listed in upper case. Each protein or metabolite is color coded on
  whether it was detected and/or significantly changed between Cox10-/- and Cox10f/f
  livers. For mitochondrial proteins, we classified proteins based on whether they
  were significantly up or downregulated in either the whole cell lysate or enriched
  mitochondrial dataset. Rate-limiting enzymes are indicated in boxes. Numerical data
  for individual panels are provided in .
