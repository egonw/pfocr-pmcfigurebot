caption: Examples of metabolic activation in microbial degradation pathways. (A) A
  major aerobic bacterial pathway for metabolizing benzenoid rings requires energy
  input to activate molecular oxygen for attack on the ring. The activated ring is
  then cleaved and fragments are assimilated in subsequent metabolism. (B) 4-Chlorobenzoate
  is activated for dichlorination via an initial energy-requiring thioesterification
  of the carboxylate moiety via coenzyme A. (C) The C–P bond of alkylphosphonates
  is relatively unreactive and is activated using ATP to accomplish C–P bond cleavage
  to release inorganic phosphate in phosphorus-poor environments.
