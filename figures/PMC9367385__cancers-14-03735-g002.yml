caption: 'Analysis of TCGA database revealed the expression of SH3TC2 and clinical
  characteristics in CRC. (A) Advanced CRC patients had higher expression of SH3TC2.
  However, expression of SH3TC2 did not correlate with the T, N, or M stages. Cibersoft
  (B), MCPCounter (C), and TIMER (D) analyses revealed that the expression of SH3TC2
  may correlate with T-cell infiltration. Statistical analysis was compared to the
  control or normal groups: ns, not significant; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; **** p <
  0.001.'

  and Promotes Tumorigenesis via the MAPK Pathway.
