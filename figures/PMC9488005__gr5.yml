caption: a, Significantly enriched pathways. b, Heatmap of differently expressed genes
  of the PPAR signaling pathway. c, Heatmap of differently expressed genes of fatty
  acid metabolism pathway. NS means there is no significant difference compared with
  the control group. d, Significantly enriched pathways for both differentially expressed
  genes and differentially changed metabolites in 0.3 μg L−1cis-BF exposure group.
  e, The gene expressions in DCA supplemental study. Data are presented as mean ± SEM,
  ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01 and ∗∗∗p < 0.001 indicate significant differences compared
  with the control group.
