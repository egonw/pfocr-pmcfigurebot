caption: Role of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in alleviation of ZEA-induced TM4
  cell injury by RSV. (A) Expression levels of p-Akt (ser 473) and Akt relative proteins
  in TM4 cells. TM4 cells were treated with different concentrations of RSV (0, 1,
  2.5, and 5 μmol·L−1) for 24 h. (B) Expression levels of p-Akt (ser 473), p-PI3K,
  PI3K, and Akt relative proteins in TM4 cells. TM4 cells were pretreated with RSV
  (2.5 μmol·L−1) for 3 h, and then treated with or without ZEA (20 μmol·L−1) for 24
  h. (C) Expression levels of p-Akt (ser 473), Akt, and Nrf2 nuclear accumulative
  relative proteins in TM4 cells. TM4 cells were incubated with LY294002 (10 μmol·L−1)
  for 1 h after pretreatment with RSV (2.5 μmol·L−1) for 3 h, then exposed to ZEA
  (20 μmol·L−1) for 24 h. (D) The HO-1 relative protein expression level in TM4 cells.
  (E) The viability of TM4 cells detected by CCK-8 assay. (F) Apoptosis of TM4 cells
  analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells were treated as described above and mixed with
  5 μL of Annexin V-FITC and 5 μL of PI, and then incubated in the dark for 20 min
  at 25 °C. Different letters (a, b, c, d, e) represent a significant difference (p
  < 0.05 calculated by ANOVA (A,B,E,F) or a t-test (C,D) for each group), while the
  same letters indicate no significant difference between groups.
