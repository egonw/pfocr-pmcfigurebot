caption: SAL directly inhibits NRF2-KEAP1 complex and facilitates NRF2-induced SIRT3
  transcription. A IF of NRF2 (green) and nuclei (blue) in SH-SY5Y cells. Nuclei counterstained
  with DAPI. Scale bar, 50 μm. B Quantification shows the nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio
  of NRF2 levels. C qPCR shows the NRF2 mRNA levels in SH-SY5Y cells treated with
  indicated dose of SAL. D Immunoblotting images (left) and quantification of band
  intensity (right) show the protein levels of NRF2 and SIRT3 in SH-SY5Y cells with
  or without SAL treatment. E As in D, except cytosolic (Cyto) and nuclear (Nuc) protein
  were isolated and detected. F Immunoprecipitation (IP) shows the protein levels
  of NRF2 and KEAP1-Flag in SH-SY5Y cells with indicated treatment. An anti-Flag antibody
  was used for IP. 5% total protein used as input. G Surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
  analyses show the SAL-NRF2 interaction behavior. Quantitation shows the sensogram
  of each indicated titration of SAL, as expressed in RU (response units-Y axis) along
  time (X-axis). H Cellular thermal shift assays (CETSA) show the binding capacity
  of SAL-NRF2 interaction. Immunoblotting shows NRF2 levels and below graph shows
  the CETSA melting curve. I Immunoblotting shows the NRF2 levels in protein lysates
  at 55 °C. The below graph shows the ITDR-CETSA curve. Error bars indicate mean ± SD
  from at least 3 independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, n.s.,
  not significant; one-way ANOVA
