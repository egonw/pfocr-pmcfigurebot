caption: 'Subcellular localization of β-catenin (green) and E-cadherin (red) proteins
  in SW480 and HT29 cells treated with chlorogenic acid (CGA), roasted coffee (TC),
  and green coffee (GC) at 24 h. The panel (A) includes representative images, and
  the (B) panel is the β-catenin protein fluorescence intensity in both treated cell
  lines. The images were captured through an Olympus FV1000 confocal laser scanner
  microscope with a 60x objective and image scale of 150 µm. Values are expressed
  as the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments. Two-way ANOVA, difference to
  non-treated cells, ** p ≤ 0.01; # = number.'
