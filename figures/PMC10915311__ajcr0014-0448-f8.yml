caption: PI3K inhibitor decreased NTS-induced pancreatic cancer motility in 2D and
  3D models. MIA PaCa-2 (A, left) and KPC (A, right) were treated with NTS with or
  without PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and GDC-0941, and the effect on Akt phosphorylation
  (A), migration (B, MIA PaCa-2; E, KPC), invasion (C, MIA PaCa-2; F, KPC), and 3D
  recruitment (D, MIA PaCa-2; G, KPC) was assayed. *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01.
