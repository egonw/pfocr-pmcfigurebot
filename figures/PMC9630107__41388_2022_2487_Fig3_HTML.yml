figure_title: Overview of glucose metabolism proteins regulated by Src
caption: 'Solid ovals represent proteins regulated by Src. Metabolic pathways are
  highlighted in different colours: blue, glucose transporter; green, glycolysis;
  orange, anaerobic glycolysis, and pink, the pentose phosphate pathway. References
  relating to Src regulation of each protein are indicated next to it. The tyrosine
  residues phosphorylated by Src are indicated together with the corresponding reference.
  Glycolytic metabolites: G6P glucose-6-phosphate, F6P fructose-6-phosphate, F-1,6-BP
  fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, F-2,6-BP fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, DHAP dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate, GA3P Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, 1,3-BPG 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, 3-PG
  3-phosphoglycerate, 2-PG 2-phosphoglycerate, PEP phosphoenolpyruvate. Pentose phosphate
  pathway metabolites: 6-PGL 6-phosphogluconolactone, R5P 5-ribulose-phosphate. Enzymes:
  HK hexokinase, GPI glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, PFK-1 phosphofructokinase 1, PFKFB3
  6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, GAPDH glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, PGK phosphoglycerate
  kinase, PMu phosphoglycerate mutase, ENO enolase, PK pyruvate kinase, LDH lactate
  dehydrogenase, G6PD glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6PGD 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase.'
