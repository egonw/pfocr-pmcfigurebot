caption: RES promoted the cell viability and osteoblastogenesis in BMSCs under hypoxia.
  (A) Flow cytometry demonstrated that BMSCs presented high expressions of CD29 and
  CD90, and low expressions of CD11 and CD45. (B) The viability of BMSCs under hypoxia
  was measured. (C) The viability of BMSCs from control group, hypoxia group, L-RES
  group and H-RES group was detected. (D) ARS staining results of BMSCs from control
  group, hypoxia group, L-RES group and H-RES group. (E) ALP staining results of BMSCs
  from control group, hypoxia group, L-RES group and H-RES group.(F,G) quantification
  for %area. The mRNA expression level of (H) ALP, (I) OPN, (J) RUNX2, (K) OCN were
  measured by RT-PCR. Values were expressed as mean ± SD. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01;
  all the assays were repeated more than three times.
