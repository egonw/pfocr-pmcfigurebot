caption: Circ_0055412 positively modulates CAPG expression in glioma cells. (A, B)
  The localization of circ_0055412 in glioma cells was investigated by subcellular
  fractionation and FISH assays. (C, D) CAPG expression at mRNA and protein levels
  was examined when circ_0055412 expression was lessened in glioma cells. (E) RIP
  assay was operated to examine the enrichment of CAPG in Ago2 antibody when circ_0055412
  was downregulated. **p < 0.01
article_title: Knockdown of circ_0055412 promotes cisplatin sensitivity of glioma
  cells through modulation of CAPG and Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway.
