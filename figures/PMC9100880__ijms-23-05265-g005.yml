caption: Inhibiting Hedgehog signaling disrupted FGF and WNT pathways. RT-qPCR for
  FGF10 (A) and FGFR2 (B) in 5E1-treated explants compared to control (results show
  mean ± SEM, n = 6 for each group). In situ hybridization for FGF10 (green), SHH
  (red), and CDH1 (IF-white) performed on control (C) and 5E1-treated (D) explants.
  FISH dots quantification (E) revealed more FGF10 in 5E1 compared to control (results
  show mean ± SEM, n = 3 for each group). RT-qPCR for RSPO2 (F) and its receptor LGR4
  (G) on explants treated with 5E1 compared to control (results show mean ± SEM, n
  = 6 for each group). In situ hybridization for PTCH1 (green), RSPO2 (red), and CDH1
  (IF-white) performed on control (H) and 5E1-treated (I) explants. (J) FISH dots
  quantification for RSPO2 confirmed RT-qPCR results (results show mean ± SEM; n =
  3 in each group). * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01.
