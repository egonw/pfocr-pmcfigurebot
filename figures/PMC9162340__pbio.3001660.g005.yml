figure_title: The BLT region influences the activity of overexpressed Punt and is
  required for animal fitness in a rescue assay
caption: '(A) BLT-containing Punt proteins caused more ectopic lethality than a form
  of Punt that is apicalized in imaginal discs. en-GAL4 driving UAS-Punt[BLT] proteins
  revealed differential temperature sensitivity for lethality; Survival Fraction of
  0.5 is full survival relative to control balancer chromosome (A). Animals counted
  at 21 degrees: control, 605; Punt[Punt], 465; Punt[Apis], 423; Punt[Wit], 484. At
  25 degrees: control, 390; Punt[Punt], 216; Punt[Apis], 284; Punt[Wit], 82. See  for
  additional overexpression results. (B–G) Genomic rescue constructs (transgenes composed
  of a 7 kb genomic region with a carboxyl-terminal GFP tag) link viability to presence
  of the BLT. Juxtamembrane amino acid sequences for the rescue constructs (B). Punt-GFP
  staining by anti-GFP IF showed primarily basolateral restriction (C). The EG point
  mutant displayed mild apicalization (D), whereas the Δ19 construct presented a stronger
  apical signal (E). Single prime (′) panels show zoomed image with yellow arrowheads
  indicating the profiles in double prime (′′) panels. The Δ19 version of Punt showed
  more junction and apical staining (Apical Index) than the WT and EG versions (F);
  statistical code is for comparison of Δ19 and WT constructs. See  for expression
  pattern of the rescue construct-expressed Punt proteins. PuntWT and EG constructs
  provide sufficient activity to support robust survival to adulthood, but the Δ19
  construct supported only limited survival; Rescue Index of 1.0 is full survival
  relative to control balancer chromosome genotype (G). Animals counted for one copy
  rescue: WT, 585; EG, 564; Δ19, 589 and for 2 copy rescue: WT, 231; EG, 197; Δ19,
  251 (G). Statistical codes for one copy of PuntEG and PuntΔ19 are in comparison
  to one copy of PuntWT; those for 2 copy tests are relative to the matching one copy
  tests. Lethal phase observations showed that Punt-GFPΔ19 animals exhibited increased
  pupal lethality in each of 4 biological replicates E1-E4 (H); numerical data shown
  on graph. WT and EG rescue constructs supported female fertility, but the Δ19 construct
  did not (I); F1x represents Females with 1 copy of the rescue construct, F2x represents
  Females with 2 copies, and M1x represents Males with 1 copy; numerical data and
  statistical significance shown on graph. Scale bars: 100 μm for C–E, 15 μm for C′–E′.
  n.s. indicates p > 0.0.5, * indicates p < 0.05, *** indicates p < 0.0001 for Fisher
  exact tests (G, I) or TukeyHSD (F). The data underlying all the graphs shown in
  the figure can be found in . BLT, basolateral targeting; WT, wild-type.'
