caption: Mechanism of hypoxia-mediated CYP1B1 upregulation through ER activation.
  In the presence of estrogen as an ER ligand, estrogen directly binds ER or induces
  CYP1B1 expression through ER activation through a ligand-dependent pathway. Under
  hypoxia, even in the absence of estrogen, a ligand-independent pathway can be induced
  in ER-positive breast cancer cells by the activation of kinases that phosphorylate
  ER or by binding of increased HIF-1α to ER to induce CYP1B1 expression.

  breast cancer cells.
