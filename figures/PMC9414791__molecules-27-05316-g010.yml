caption: 'Protective effect of 80% ethanolic extract from Gimcheon 1ho (GC) cultivar
  walnut (Juglans regia) on HFD-induced synaptic disorders and neuronal apoptosis
  in mice brain tissues: (a) representative Western blots for total protein and expression;
  (b) protein expression levels of p-JNK, p-Akt, p-tau, IDE, Aβ, BAX, caspase-3. Results
  shown are mean ± SD (n = 3). Data are statistically represented with * = significantly
  different from the NC group, and # = significantly different from PM group; * and
  # p < 0.05, ** and ##p < 0.01. Bold line indicates mean.'
