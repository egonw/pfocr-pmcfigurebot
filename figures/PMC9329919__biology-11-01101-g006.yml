caption: Analysis of the p38 Mapk signaling pathway in iBAT from WT and corin KO mice.
  (A) RT-PCR analysis of Corin, Nppa, and Npra mRNA expression in heart (positive
  control), iBAT, and ingWAT from WT and corin KO mice (4-month-old males). In the
  negative control (Ctrl), RT-PCR was performed without cDNA templates. Actb, encoding
  β-actin, was included as another sample control. Representative data of three experiments
  are shown. (B) A proposed mechanism of corin function in iBAT. Corin activates ANP,
  which binds to its receptor NPR-A on adipocytes and increases intracellular cGMP
  production, leading to p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38) phosphorylation
  (P) and subsequent Pgc1α activation and Ucp1 expression. (C) Western blotting of
  phosphorylated p38 Mapk (p-p38 Mapk), p38 Mapk, Pgc1α, and Ucp1 proteins in iBAT
  from WT and corin KO mice. Gapdh was included as a control. Data are representative
  of three experiments. (D–F) Levels of p-p38 Mapk (D, left), p38 Mapk (D, right),
  Pgc1α (E), and Ucp1 (F) in iBAT from WT and corin KO mice were normalized using
  Gapdh as a reference. Data of mean ± SEM are presented. p values were examined by
  Student’s t test.
