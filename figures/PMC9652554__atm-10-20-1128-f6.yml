caption: 'The silencing of SAAL1 alleviated the LPS-induced cell apoptosis by modulating
  the NLR signaling pathway. (A) The expression of NLRP3 protein in the A549 cells
  was measured by western blotting. (B) Cell viability was checked by CCK-8. (C) Cell
  apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. (D-F) The production of TNF-α, IL-6, and
  IL-1β in the A549 cells was measured by ELISAs. **, P<0.01 vs. si-NC + LPS group;
  ##, P<0.01 vs. si-SAAL1 + Vector + LPS group. SAAL1, serum amyloid A-like 1; LPS,
  lipopolysaccharide; CCK-8, Cell Counting Kit-8; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor alpha;
  IL-1β, interleukin-1 beta; ELISAs, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate dehydrogenase; si-NC, small interfering RNA negative control.'
