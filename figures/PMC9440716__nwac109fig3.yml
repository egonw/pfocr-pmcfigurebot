caption: ROL1 dysfunction turns the plant association with GB03 from beneficial into
  unfavorable. (a) ROL1 dysfunction and GMVs showed contrasting impacts on plant lipidome.
  The heat map shows 321 species of lipid and fatty acids detected by UPLC-qTOF-MS.
  Three biological replicates harvested at 3 DAT. (b) GMVs enhanced the production
  of major chloroplastic lipids in Col-0 but not the rol1-2 mutant. Different letters
  denote significant differences at P < 0.05, Tukey's multiple comparison test, for
  each lipid category. (c) The prokaryotic pathway of lipid biosynthesis [], which
  starts from ACT1-catalyzed acylation of G3P with 18 : 1, plays a central role in
  dictating plant compatibility with GB03. In wild-type plants, GMVs enhance the production
  of chloroplastic lipids in supporting plant growth promotion; whereas in the rol1
  mutants, attempts to enhance chloroplastic lipid production would exacerbate 18 : 1
  deficiency, making the association unfavorable for plants. The oxidative cleavage
  of MGDG and DGDG is included to highlight the negative impact of ROS accumulation
  on this pathway.
