caption: 'PAR2 deficiency in WAT or addition of Pref-1 decreases non-inflammatory
  adipose MIF release and improves insulin sensitivity(A) WT mice at 18 weeks were
  anesthetized and transplanted with WT or Par2−/− visceral epididymal adipose tissue.
  Following 2-week recovery, these mice at 20 weeks will be fed with normal chow (NC)
  or high palmitic acid diet (PD) for 8 weeks.(B–H) Plasma Pref-1 (B) and MIF (C) levels
  in the mice transplanted with WT or Par2−/− adipose tissue following NC or PD diet
  feeding. Insulin resistance was assessed by GTT and ITT (D). Body weight gain, adipose
  weight (AT)/body weight (BW) ratio, adipocyte size, and M1/M2 ratio in adipose tissue
  were measured in these mice as well (E to H) (Scale bars, 20 μm in G).(I) WT mice
  at 20 weeks were fed with NC or PD for 8 weeks. During the last 4 weeks, the mice
  were infused with vehicle or recombinant Pref-1 protein (rPref-1, 24 μg/day/kg)
  by osmotic pump.(J–R) Plasma Pref-1 levels, PPARγ gene expression, adipose MIF and
  p115 contents, and plasma MIF levels were subsequently evaluated from (J) to (M).
  Insulin resistance was assessed by GTT and ITT in (N). Body weight gain, adipose
  tissue weight, adipocyte size, and expression of inflammatory factors were quantified
  from (O) to (R) (Scale bars, 20 μm in Q).(S) Schematic diagram for the mechanism
  of PAR2/AMPK/Pref-1/MIF release signaling pathway. Pref-1 is expressed and released
  in Pref-1+ cells with characteristics of M2 macrophages, endothelial cells or progenitors.
  Pref-1 inhibits MIF release from both Pref-1+ cells and adipocytes by binding with
  cell membrane integrin β1 and inhibiting the mobilization of p115, a cofactor for
  MIF release. High palmitic acid (PA) induces PAR2 expression in Pref-1+ cells, leading
  to the downregulation of Pref-1 expression and its release in an AMPK-dependent
  manner. When Pref-1 secretion is reduced, Pref-1+ cells and adipocytes increase
  MIF release and its plasma content, resulting in insulin resistance.All data are
  presented as mean ± SD. n = 6 each animal group. ∗p ≤ 0.05 increase vs. other groups
  in (C, D, F and J); vs. WT to WT NC or Par2−/− to WT PD in (E); vs. NC in (O) and
  (P). #p ≤ 0.05 reduction vs. other groups in (B); vs. NC in (J); vs. PD + Vehicle
  in (M) and (N). The n.s. represents no significance.'
