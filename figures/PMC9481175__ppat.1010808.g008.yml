figure_title: Schematic representation of WSSV-mediated activation of the mTORC1 signaling
  pathway by the pIgR-CaM-AKT-mTORC1 signalling cascade
caption: WSSV binds to the extracellular domain of pIgR to facilitate the endocytosis
  of virions into cells. CaM, working as bridge, interacts with the receptor and PH
  domain of AKT, and promotes AKT activation. Activated AKT then promotes the activation
  of mTORC1 pathway. mTORC1 further promotes viral DNA and protein synthesis by activating
  its downstream effectors, 4EBP1, S6K1, and S6K2, and finally promotes WSSV proliferation.

  its replication via polymeric immunoglobulin receptor-mediated infection in shrimp.
