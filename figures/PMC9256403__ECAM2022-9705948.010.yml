caption: 'SKI regulated TGF-β1-mediated activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway in HK-2 cells: (a) immunofluorescence staining demonstrating that β-catenin
  protein expression was inhibited by SKI (200×); (b) western blotting images of active
  β-catenin, Snail1, TCF4, WNT1, β-catenin, and PAI-1, which are involved in the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway; (c–h) graphic presentation of active β-catenin, Snail1, TCF4,
  WNT1, β-catenin, and PAI-1 expression in the four groups as indicated; and (i–m)
  qRT-PCR revealed that SKI reversed the increased level of Snail1, Tcf4, Ctnnb1 (β-catenin),
  and PAI-1 mRNA expression.'
