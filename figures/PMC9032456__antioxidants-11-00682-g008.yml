caption: The protective effect of DHA against PA-induced inflammation. (A) mRNA expression
  levels of inflammatory genes after DHA treatment (n = 4). (B) The mRNA expression
  level of tlr22 after DHA treatment (n = 4). (C) Western blot analysis of MAPK signaling
  activation and the PPARγ protein level after DHA treatment (n = 3). The ratios of
  p-p38 to p38, p-JNK to JNK and PPARγ to GAPDH were determined. (D) The mRNA expression
  level of nrf2 after DHA treatment (n = 4). Data are presented as the means ± SEM
  and analyzed using one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s test. Bars labeled with the
  same letters are not significantly different (p > 0.05).
