caption: 'Effects of YOH on PDGF-BB-induced proliferation and cell cycle progression
  in MOVAS-1 cells. (A) Chemical structure of YOH. (B) Starved MOVAS-1 cells (4 ×
  104 cells/well) were pretreated with YOH (5, 10, and 20 μM) for 45 min and then
  treated with PDGF-BB (10 ng/mL) for 48 h, and the cell cycle progression was monitored
  for 18 h. The cell proliferation index (a) and cell viability (b) were measured
  as described in the Materials and Methods section. (C) Images of the morphology
  of MOVAS-1 cells stimulated without (a) or with (b) PDGF-BB (10 ng/mL) after pretreatment
  with YOH at (c) 10 or (d) 20 μM, the black bar indicates 100 μm. (D) Cells were
  pretreated without (a) or with (b) solvent control (0.1% DMSO), (c) 10 μM YOH, or
  (d) 20 μM YOH and then stimulated with PDGF-BB (10 ng/mL) for 18 h. The samples
  were collected by trypsinization and then subjected to flow cytometry. The complied
  statistical data are included (e). *** p < 0.001, compared with the resting group;
  ##p < 0.01 and ###p < 0.001 compared with the solvent control group. Data are presented
  as the mean ± S.E.M. (n = 4).'
