  homeostasis
caption: AHierarchical clustering heatmap analysis of the 60 most altered metabolites
  in cells treated with DFP for the length of time indicated. Each coloured cell on
  the map corresponds to a z‐score value. The list was generated using MetaboAnalyst
  software and determined with an ANOVA test with a P < 0.05 threshold followed by
  post‐hoc analysis. The hierarchical clustering method of one minus Pearson correlation
  was applied (n = 3, with 4 technical replicates per biological replicate).B–DVolcano
  plots representing the difference in the mean of metabolites from DFP‐treated cells
  compared with control cells at acute (30 min), 8 h and overnight (24 h) timepoints,
  generated by unpaired t‐test with an FDR of 0.01. Coloured points represent significantly
  altered features.E–GPathway analysis generated in MetaboAnalyst using the significantly
  altered metabolites from the volcano plot comparisons. Statistical analysis was
  determined by hypergeometric test, and the library used for pathway analysis was
  SMPDB.
