caption: CPNE8 acted on the Focal adhesion pathway to promote GC metastasis. (A) KEGG
  functional enrichment analysis revealed a significant correlation between CPNE8
  expression and Focal adhesion pathway in AGS-sh-CPNE8 cells compared to the control
  cells. (B) There are relative changes of FAK (Gene Symbol as PTK2) and ERK mRNA
  levels in GC cells with knockdown or overexpression of CPNE8. (C) Western blot analysis
  of FAK, p-FAK, total Erk1/2, and p-ERK protein expression in GC cells with knockdown
  or overexpression of CPNE8. Relative protein expression (interested protein/GAPDH)
  was also quantified in GC cells. (D) EDU staining assay showed the proliferating
  cells with or without diminishing FAK expression, such as GSK2256098 treatment and
  knockdown of FAK. Photos were captured using a fluorescence microscope (Leica-Microsystems).
  DNA (blue) was stained with Hoechst. Cyan cells showed EDU/Hoechst-positive cells.
  The column diagram represented the proliferation rates in various GC cells. Data
  are presented as mean Â± SD for at least three independent experiments. (E) Wound-healing
  assays revealed that both GSK2256098 and si-FAK could quantitatively reduce the
  CPNE8-induced migration in BGC823 cells using Image J software. (F) Transwell assays
  confirmed that GSK2256098 or knocking down FAK could inhibit migration and invasiveness
  of GC cells with overexpression of CPNE8. (G) The representative images showed the
  adhesion ability of GC cells with knockdown or overexpression of CPNE8 compared
  to the control cells and the attenuation of BGC823-oe-CPNE8 with GSK2256098 or knockdown
  of FAK. The number of GC cells shown in the bar graph that adhered to the plates
  coated after 2h of incubation was quantified using Image J software.
