caption: 'Prediction and validation of biological functions of ZBED2. (A) Heatmap
  of the Spearman coefficients for the correlations between ZBED2 expression and 27
  cancer‐related pathways in five cohorts based on the Affymetrix U133 platform. The
  pathway activities were computed using BinReg approach as described in Supplementary
  Methods. Each cell represents one coefficient value. (B) Dot plot showing ZBED2‐related
  enrichment of hallmark gene sets in GSEA of all the 8 cohorts in this study. Each
  node dot indicates that the corresponding hallmark gene set is enriched in ER‐negative
  BC with higher expression of ZBED2 in the corresponding BC cohort. The dot size
  represents the enrichment degree (shown as the absolute value of NES minus 1.35)
  of hallmark gene sets. The color intensity of dotes represents the FDR values obtained
  in GSEA analysis. The 7 gene sets that show enrichment in all of the 8 cohorts were
  highlighted in rectangle. (C) Effects of ZBED2 on ISG expression induced by IFNγ
  in two ER‐negative BC cell lines MDA‐MB‐231 and SK‐BR‐3. Cells infected with or
  without ZBED2 lentivirus were treated with IFNγ for 12 h prior to Western blotting
  analysis. (D) Upregulation or downregulation of ZBED2 is observed after lentivirus‐transduced
  overexpression or knockdown using Western blotting analysis. (E) Colony formation
  of MDA‐MB‐231 and SK‐BR‐3 cells upon overexpression or silence of ZBED2. The cells
  were recovered in regular media for 10 days, and colonies were counted from more
  than three experiments. Left panel: A representative result of colony formation
  of BC cells. Right panel: Bar graph presentation of the colony numbers (mean ± standard
  deviation) from three experiments. Abbreviations: ALK, anaplastic lymphoma kinase;
  AR, androgen receptor; BCAT, Wnt/β‐catenin; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor;
  ER, estrogen receptor; GluDep, glucose deprivation; HER2, human epidermal growth
  factor receptor 2; IFN, interferon; IGF1, insulin like growth factor 1; LacAci,
  lactic acidosis; NES, normalized enrichment score; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3‐kinases;
  PR, progesterone receptor; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3; TGFβ, transforming growth factor‐β; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α'
