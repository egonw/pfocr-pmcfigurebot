caption: 'Human adipocyte metabolome is modulated in the presence of breast mammary
  cells under hypoxia. SGBS adipocytes were cultured with MCF-10A cells CM in normoxia
  (NX, 21% O2, white bars) or HX (0.5% O2, black bars) for 24h.Targeted LC/MS analysis
  in SGBS media (n=3/group). Representation of changes in energy metabolites, TCA
  cycle intermediates, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) intermediates. Ordinate axes
  represent metabolite peak area. Values presented as mean+/- SEM. Significance by
  Students t-test *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001. Note: in Nx, adipocytes and CCM was
  prepared in Nx. In Hx, adipocytes and CCM in Hx.'
