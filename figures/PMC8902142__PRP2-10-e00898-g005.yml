caption: 'The metabolic fate of capecitabine in 3 independent KPC‐derived tumors.
  The pre‐active species are represented in shades of blue, ordered as in the metabolic
  pathway: capecitabine (CAP), 5’‐deoxy‐5‐fluorocytidine (5’DFCR), 5’‐deoxy‐5‐fluorouridine
  (5’DFUR), 5‐fluorouracil (5‐FU). The inactive metabolites, are represented in shades
  of gold, also as ordered as in the metabolic pathway: 5,6 dihydrofluorouracil (5‐FUH2),
  α‐fluoro‐β‐ureidopropionic acid (FUPA), β‐fluoroalanine (FBAL). Values are the average
  of three replicates; 78% of injected drug is in the form of pre‐active species,
  ± 2.5% (SD)'
article_title: Analysis of capecitabine metabolites in conjunction with digital autoradiography
  in a murine model of pancreatic cancer suggests extensive drug penetration through
  the tumor.
