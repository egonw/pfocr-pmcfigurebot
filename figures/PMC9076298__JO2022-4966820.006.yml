caption: Functional analyses of the ECMRG signature in TCGA dataset. (a) PCA of differential
  gene expression profiles between the high-risk and low-risk groups. (b) Heat map
  plotting the metascore from GSVA analysis. GSVA analysis was performed to assess
  the pathway enrichment scores in each glioma sample in TCGA dataset. (c) GSEA showing
  the enriched oncogenic pathways, metabolic alternations, and immune infiltration
  in the high-risk group. (d) Heat map showing the elevated metabolic pathways for
  gliomas in the high-risk group. (e) Dot plots comparing the metascore of metabolic
  pathways for glioma patients between the high-risk and low-risk groups. ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
