caption: Example of pathway activation chart. Green lines show top 10 most strongly
  activated pathways (ordered top to bottom), red lines show top 10 most strongly
  inhibited pathways (ordered bottom to top). Thickness is proportionate to absolute
  value of PAL. In this example, RNA sequencing gene expression profiles of three
  thyroid cancer samples  were compared with six healthy thyroid normal samples from
  ANTE collection . PAL values, t-test p-values and FDR-adjusted p-values are shown
  right to the pathway names. (For interpretation of the references to color in this
  figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
