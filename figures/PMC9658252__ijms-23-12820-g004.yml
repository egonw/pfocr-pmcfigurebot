caption: Effect of TriL on carotid artery ligation induced intimal hyperplasia in
  mice. After carotid-ligation, mice received oral administration of saline or different
  doses of TriL (100 and 200 mg/kg) once daily for 28 days. Intimal hyperplasia morphology
  was assessed by measuring the total lumen area, intima area (I), media area (M),
  and intima/media ratio (I/M). (A,B) represent photomicrographs of hematoxylin-eosin
  (H-E) staining, and (C,D) represent PCNA-immunoactivity staining of arterial section
  (200Ã—). The arrow indicated the PCNA-positive cell. (E) I/M ratio. (F) PCNA-positive
  cells per total cells. Scare bar = 50 mm. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 compared with
  the control (saline) group (n = 5).
