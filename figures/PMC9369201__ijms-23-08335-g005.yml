caption: 'ERK1/2 signal is involved in the regulation of apoptosis of cementoblasts
  and the caspases pathway. (A,B) Graphics show the percentages of apoptotic cells
  exposed to ERK1/2 inhibitor (1.0 μg/mL, FR180204) as well as co-stimulation with
  CNTF (400 ng/mL). (C) The scheme summarizes the mode of CNTF action in cementoblasts:
  CNTF activated the tripartite CNTF-receptor complex targets and phosphorylated GP130
  protein, which recruits ERK1/2 signaling and caspases signaling expression. FR180204
  promotes apoptosis in OCCM-30 cells and CNTF addition suppressed the ERK1/2 inhibitor-induced
  apoptosis within a short-term period. Bar indicates values ± standard deviation
  (SD) which represent three independent experiments. Statistically significant differences
  (indicated by asterisks) are shown as follows (** p < 0.005; *** p < 0.0005).'
