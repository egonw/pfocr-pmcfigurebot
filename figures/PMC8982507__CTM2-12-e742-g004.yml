caption: 'Ablation of Cxxc5 resists obesity‐related insulin resistance and hepatosteatosis
  in HFD‐fed mice. (A–E) Cxxc5+/+ and Cxxc5−/− mice were fed HFD or NCD for 8 weeks
  (n = 9–13 per group). Representative photographs of HFD‐fed Cxxc5+/+ and Cxxc5−/−
  mice (A), body weight (B), fasting glucose levels (C), glucose tolerance test (D)
  and insulin tolerance test (E) and area under the curve (AUC). (F, G) epiWAT from
  Cxxc5+/+ and Cxxc5−/− mice fed HFD for 8 weeks (n = 9–13 per group). Representative
  images of IHC staining for β‐catenin, Cxxc5 (F), F4/80 and Cxxc5 (G: left panel)
  and the correlation of cytosolic Cxxc5 with the number of CLSs (G: right panel).
  (H) Relative expression levels of Wnt/β‐catenin pathway target (left panel) and
  adipogenesis (right) genes. Expression levels of mRNA were normalized by HFD‐fed
  Cxxc5+/+ mice group. (I, J) Liver tissue from Cxxc5+/+ and Cxxc5−/− mice fed HFD
  for 8 weeks (n = 9–13 per group). Representative images of H&E staining and Oil
  Red O staining (I: left panel) and TG concentration in the liver tissue (I: right
  panel) and relative mRNA expression levels of Wnt/β‐catenin signalling target and
  gluconeogenic genes (J). Expression levels of mRNA were normalized by HFD‐fed Cxxc5+/+
  mice group. Scale bars = 100 μm. All data are presented as the mean ± SD. *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 determined by Student''s t‐test'
