caption: Overview of the effects of acidic pHe and hypoxia on TRPC and ORAI Ca2+-permeable
  channels. The positive or negative effects of hypoxia and acidic pHe on the Ca2+-permeable
  channels were obtained from both normal and cancer cell-related studies, while the
  signalling pathways indicated were obtained uniquely from cancer cell-based investigations.
  The figure depicts TRPCs- and SOCs-mediated Ca2+-dependent signalling pathways inhibited
  or activated by acidic pHe or hypoxia and linked to tumour progression. TRPC (TRPC1,
  4, 5) expressed in cancer cells’ plasma membrane is all activated by acidic pHe
  or hypoxia, transducing their signals to activate Ca2+-dependent downstream effectors,
  such as SMAD2/3, NFAT, STAT3, HIF1, AMPK and β-catenin. These effectors promote
  tumour cell migration, angiogenesis, invasion, proliferation, mesenchymal phenotype
  and chemoresistance and the expression of TRPC1, via EGFR activation, and TRPC6
  via Notch1 signalling pathway, in a mechanism of positive feedback regulation for
  both TRPC1 and TRPC6 channels. Immune cells expressing TRPC6 channels on plasma
  membrane show TRPC6’s activity that is inhibited by acidic pHe, reducing their migration.
  ORAI1 channels function in immune cells is also negatively affected by acidic pHe,
  impairing different processes needed for immune cells’ anti-tumour activity. Hypoxia
  promotes both ORAI1 expression, via Notch signalling pathway, and activation, leading
  to increased ROS resistance, migration, invasion, EMT and cell survival. CaM, calmodulin;
