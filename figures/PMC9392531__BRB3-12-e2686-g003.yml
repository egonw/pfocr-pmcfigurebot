caption: 'Treatment with mild hypothermia upregulated nuclear factor erythroid 2‐related
  factor 2‐antioxidant response element (Nrf2‐ARE) pathway expression and activation
  after traumatic brain injury (TBI). (a) Representative immunoblot bands and (b)
  quantitative analysis of Nrf2 at the protein level at 24 h after TBI. Real‐time
  quantitative PCR analysis of the downstream factors of the Nrf2 signaling pathway
  and the mRNA levels of heme oxygenase‐1 (HO‐1) (c) and NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase‐1
  (NQO‐1) (d). n = 6/group. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. **p < .01, ***p
  < .001, ##p < .01, ###p < .001, nsp > .05'
