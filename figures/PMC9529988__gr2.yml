caption: 'High glucose conditions inhibited SC proliferation, increased cell apoptosis,
  and downregulated the expression of miR-21 in cells and exosomes(A) The cell viability
  of SC was examined by CCK-8 assay, high glucose causes cell viability to decrease
  (n = 10-well, one-way ANOVA: ∗∗∗p < 0.001 versus the low glucose group. ###p < 0.001
  versus the normal glucose group).(B) The expression of miR-21 in SC and exosomes
  was detected by qPCR, and miR-21 was downregulated in the high glucose group compared
  with that of the low glucose group (n = 10 samples; t-test: ∗∗∗p < 0.001 versus
  the low glucose group).(C) Exosome markers (CD9 and CD63) were detected by Western
  blot after exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation.(D and E) Protein expression
  of p-AKT, t-AKT, and GAPDH was detected by Western blot (D), and the expression
  of the AKT signaling pathway was decreased in the high glucose group compared with
  that of the low glucose group. (E) Gray value statistics of Western blot (n = 6
  samples, nonparametric tests (Mann-Whitney Test, same below): ∗∗p < 0.01 versus
  the low glucose group).(F and G) TUNEL assay (F) was used to detect cell apoptosis
  (red), apoptosis increased in the high glucose group compared with the low glucose
  group. Scale bar: 50 μm.(G) Cell apoptosis statistics (n = 20 fields of view per
  group, nonparametric tests: ∗∗∗p < 0.001 versus the low glucose group). For the
  above, data are represented as mean ± SD.'
