caption: Predictive metabolic pathways by PICRUst2. (a) Differentially abundant Metacyc
  pathways identified after the intervention periods (mean values are presented.  shows
  each pathway names). (b) Venn diagram of the Metacyc pathways that differed between
  the washout and each beer period ( shows pathways shared and not shared by the different
  beer periods). (c) Porphyrin metabolism and heme biosynthesis routes in the washout
  period and after the consumption of the different types of beers. Values are presented
  as mean ± SD (standard deviation). * Statistically significant differences between
  groups (p < 0.05).
