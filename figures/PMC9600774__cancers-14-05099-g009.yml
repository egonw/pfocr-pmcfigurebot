caption: The Effect of compound C on OvCa cell bioenergetics. (A). Seahorse tracing
  of the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in SKOV3, OVCAR3 and IGROV1 treated with CC
  for 18 h, followed by mitochondrial stress test as described in material and methods.
  (B). Bar graphs of means ± SEM of the basal and maximal respiration, spare respiratory
  capacity, ATP production, non-mitochondrial respiration, proton leak and mitoOCR/glycoPER
  ratio in OvCa cells treated with CC. n = 6/experimental condition. * p < 0.05, with
  multiple t-tests and Holm-Sidak correction.
