caption: Curated metabolic pathway of key metabolism changes in IP subjects. Note,
  purple-colored metabolites are significant metabolites/putative biomarkers that
  are higher in IP subjects vs. healthy subjects; yellow-colored metabolites are significant
  metabolites/putative biomarkers that are lower in IP subjects vs. healthy subjects.
  Key metabolic pathways of interest identified from the pathway enrichment and impact
  analysis are annotated in pink (energy metabolism), green (nucleotide metabolism),
  or blue (amino acid metabolism).
