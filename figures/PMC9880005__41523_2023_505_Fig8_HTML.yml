figure_title: Breast tumors from different races exhibit unique racially associated
  genomic features
caption: 'The gene expression profile of the 1018 primary breast tumors from Asian,
  Black and white women was examined using iDEP.94. a Volcano plot representing the
  differential gene expression of genes vs. false-discovery rate (FDR). b MA plot
  representing average gene expression vs. fold-change between Black and Asian groups.
  Differentially expressed genes were analyzed for enriched pathways between Black
  and Asian groups using Curated MSigDB dataset. Interactive network to visualize
  the relatedness of different pathways. c Bar graph represents the gene expression
  of selected genes involved in breast cancer bone metastasis from SMID-Breast cancer
  relapse in bone UP signature in different races. White vs. Black groups: d Volcano
  plot representing the differential gene expression of genes vs. false-discovery
  rate (FDR). e MA plot representing average gene expression vs. fold-change between
  white and Black groups. Differentially expressed genes were analyzed for enriched
  pathways between white and Black groups using Curated MSigDB dataset. Interactive
  network to visualize the relatedness of different pathways. f Bar graph represents
  the gene expression of selected genes involved in breast cancer lung metastasis
  in different races from SMID-Breast cancer relapse in Lung UP. Error bars represent
  standard deviation (SD). g Bar graph represents the gene expression of selected
  genes involved in breast cancer lung metastasis from SMID-Breast cancer relapse
  in Bone UP. White vs. Asian group. Error bars represent standard deviation (SD).
  h Volcano plot representing the differential gene expression of genes vs. false-discovery
  rate (FDR). i MA plot representing average gene expression vs. fold-change between
  white and Asian groups. Differentially expressed genes were analyzed for enriched
  pathways between white and Asian groups using Curated MSigDB dataset. Interactive
  network to visualize the relatedness of different pathways between white and Asian
  groups. For (b, e, i), Red dots represent upregulated pathways while green dots
  represent downregulated pathways. The size of the dots represents the number of
  the genes imparting pathway enrichment. The connection between the two pathways
  is represented by a line.'
