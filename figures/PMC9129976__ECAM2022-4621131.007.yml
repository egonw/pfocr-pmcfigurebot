caption: FMP relieved the histopathologic damage of AA-induced UC rats. (A1–E1) Macroscopic
  pathologic observations by the naked eye. (A2–E2) H&E pathological staining of colon
  tissue from each group of rats. Arrow symbols indicate the infiltration of neutrophils
  and mononuclear inflammatory cells; triangle symbols show the disappearance, distortion,
  and exfoliation of epithelial tissue; pentagram symbols represent crypt structure
  changes. (A3–E3) AB-PAS pathological staining of colon tissue from each group of
  rats; in AB-PAS staining, various glycoproteins of glycogen neutral mucins were
  purple-red. Acidic mucins, proteoglycans, and hyaluronic acid were blue. (A4–E4)
  Masson pathological staining colon tissue from each group of rats. Fibrous tissue
  was stained blue, and the cells, cytoplasm, erythrocytes, muscle tissue, eosinophilic
  granules, and connective tissue were stained red.
