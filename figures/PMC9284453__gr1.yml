caption: Biogenesis of the two main classes of extracellular vesicles, exosomes and
  ectosomes. Exosomes are formed through the endocytic pathway, through the invagination
  of the endosomal membrane to form intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) which are released
  into the extracellular space following the fusion of the multivesicular body (MVB)
  and plasma membrane. Ectosomes, also referred to as microvesicles or microparticles,
  are formed through the outward budding of the plasma membrane. (Created with BioRender.com).
