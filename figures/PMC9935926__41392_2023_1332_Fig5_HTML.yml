caption: Hypoxia remodels CTL immune effect. HIF-1α in CTL is upgraded by TCR-PKC
  and Ca2+/calcineurin, PI3K/mTOR, NF-κB, NF-κB, JAK-STAT3, MAPK pathway. Deletion
  of pVHL impaired HIF-1α degradation. HIF-1α and HIF-1β dimerization stimulates downstream
  factor expression, such as perforin, IFN-γ, TNF-α, which can enhance the antitumor
  efficacy of CTL. However, some experiments elaborate the opposite results. Hypoxia
  inhibits the expression of IFN-γ, TNF-α, granzyme B, IL-2, perforin and NKG2D, while
  promoting PD-L1,PD-1 and CTLA-4 expression. CTL increases glucose uptake via GLUT1,
  which is metabolized to lactate by glycolytic enzymes PK and LDH. Lactate acidifies
  the TME, which inhibits CTL activation
