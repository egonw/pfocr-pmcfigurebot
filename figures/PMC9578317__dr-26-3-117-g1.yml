figure_title: TSC-22 interacts with BRD7
caption: (A) Transformants were assayed for their ability to grow on medium lacking
  leucine and for β-galactosidase expression, respectively. The interaction between
  TSC-22 and each type of BRD7 was determined by β-galactosidase expression. (B) Activity
  of interaction between TSC-22 and BRD7 was represented by the relative activity
  of β-galactoside expression. (C) HEK293a cells were transiently transfected with
  plasmid vector encoding the TSC-22 or BRD7. Total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated
  with BRD7 antibody. The immunoprecipitates were ananyzed by western blots with TSC-22
  or BRD7 antibody. (D) ICC was carried out using BRD7 (green) and TSC-22 (red) antibodies,
  and their co-localization was represented yellow color. Cell images were taken using
  a confocal fluorescence microscopy (magnification ×400). DAPI, 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole;
  BRD7, bromodomain-containing protein 7; TSC-22, transforming stimulated clone 22.
