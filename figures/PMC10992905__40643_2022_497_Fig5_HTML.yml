caption: Overview of strategies for engineering of metabolic network in heterologous
  biosynthesis. A “Push–pull–block” strategy is used to direct more metabolic flux
  to the target compounds, in which “push” indicates enhancing the precursor supply
  towards target products, “pull” means strengthening the formation ability of the
  target products, and “block” represents downregulation of the competing pathways.
  B Inter- and intra-modular pathway engineering strategy is proposed to regulate
  metabolic balance among multiple modules as well as individual genes within each
  module. C Multiplex genome engineering like multiplex automated genome engineering
  (MAGE) is applied for large-scale programming of cell factory. In MAGE, synthetic
  ssDNA pools (color lines) are transformed into engineered hosts for generation of
  a diverse set of genomic modifications
