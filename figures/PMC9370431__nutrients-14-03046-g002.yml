caption: 'Schematic overview of main mechanisms of Laminaria japonica (LJP) against
  diabetes. Insulin resistance with impairment of insulin signaling, hyperinsulinemia,
  and hyperglycemia contributes to multiple processes including elevated free fatty
  acids (FFA), protein kinase C (PKC) activation, and oxidative stress, contributing
  to inflammation and endothelial dysfunction simultaneously. LJP may decrease the
  mobilization of FFA and oxidative stress, the downregulation of PKC, and the modulation
  of inflammatory mediators including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukins,
  and the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Meanwhile, α-glucosidases
  are glycoside hydrolases found on the luminal surface of enterocytes containing
  maltase activities. LJP can help regulate and maintain an adequate blood sugar level
  by inhibiting α-glucosidase. LJP also has the potential to increase glucose uptake
  and responsiveness to insulin in the muscle and recover the pancreatic islet cell
  secreting function. FFA: free fatty acids; LJP: Laminaria japonica; NF-κB: nuclear
  factor kappa B; PKC: protein kinase C; TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor-α; ↑: increased;
  ↓: decreased.'
