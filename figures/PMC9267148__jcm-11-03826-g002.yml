caption: Kaplanâ€“Meier plots showing the comparison of overall survival of CCA patients
  according to CIAPIN1 expression. The curves represent the overall survival time
  of CCA patients having high (solid line) and low (dashed line) H-score levels. A
  significant difference of the survival time was observed between high and low H-score
  CIAPIN1 level groups by log-rank test and p < 0.05.
