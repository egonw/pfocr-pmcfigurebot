caption: KEGG pathway enrichment analysis results of differential genes. (A) KEGG
  pathway enrichment results in differential expression of circRNAs in wound tissues
  of diabetic patients. (B). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed
  circRNAs in diabetic wound tissues. (C) KEGG functional enrichment analysis of differentially
  expressed miRNAs in wound tissues of diabetic patients showed that the differentially
  expressed genes are involved in multiple signaling pathways. (D) KEGG pathway enrichment
  results of differentially expressed miRNA in diabetic wound tissues. According to
  the results of KEGG enrichment pathway analysis, the degree of enrichment was measured
  by rich factor, FDR values, and the number of miRNA target genes enriched on this
  pathway. The value range of FDR is 0–1. The closer it is to zero, the more significant
  the enrichment is. The top 20 KEGG pathways with the lowest FDR value and the most
  significant enrichment are selected for display. The abscissa is the name of the
  path, and the ordinate is—log10 (p-value) of each path.
