caption: Baicalein inhibited GC cell proliferation and induced G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis
  by regulating cell cycle. A Cell viability detected by the MTT assay; B Colony number,
  colony diameter, and colony area were detected by the colony formation assay; C Cell
  cycle detected using flow cytometry; D Apoptosis detected using flow cytometry.
  Cell experiment was repeated thrice, and data were expressed as mean ± SD. One-way
  ANOVA was used for comparisons among multiple groups, followed by Tukey’s test.
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
