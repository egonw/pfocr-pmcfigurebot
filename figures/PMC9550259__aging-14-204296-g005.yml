caption: 'ZCCHC12 contributed to OS progression through PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
  (A) The expression levels of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway-associated proteins were
  detected by western blot analysis. (B–I) functional rescue experiments using PI3K
  agonist 740Y-P or PI3K inhibitor LY294002 were performed to verify the effect of
  ZCCHC12 on proliferation and migration in OS. ZCCHC12-silenced HOS cells were treated
  with 740 Y-P while ZCCHC12-overexpressed 143B cells were treated with LY294002,
  then cells were used for proliferation analysis (B and C), CCK-assays; (D and E),
  colony formation assays) and migration analysis (F–I), Transwell migration assays
  and wound-healing assays). scale bar: 200 μm. n = 5; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P
  < 0.001.'
