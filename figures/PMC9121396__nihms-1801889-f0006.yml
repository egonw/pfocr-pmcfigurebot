figure_title: Loss of liver ALT2 does not affect blood glucose levels in lean mice
caption: (A) Gpt2 mRNA expression in liver from fed and fasted WT and LS-Gpt2−/− mice.(B)
  Blood glucose concentrations of fed and fasted WT and LS-Gpt2−/− mice (n = 14–17
  mice per group).(C and D) (C) Liver glycogen concentrations and (D) plasma branched
  chain amino acids levels of fed and fasted WT and LS-Gpt2−/− mice.(E and F) Bulk
  RNA sequencing analysis shows only Gpt2 is significantly altered by LS-Gpt2−/− knockout.
  Volcano plots of merged differential expression data from hepatic RNA of (E) fed
  WT versus LS-Gpt2−/− or (F) fasted WT versus LS-Gpt2−/− mice. Data were graphed
  as log2 fold change verses –log10 unadjusted p value. Gene expression changes were
  considered meaningful if they were >log2 fold change and had an adjusted p value
  of <0.05 versus WT mice. Graphical representation of pathway analysis showing the
  top 25 significant signal direction changes of KEGG Signaling and Metabolism pathways.
  The color of the pathway label indicates the degree and direction of the change
  and the p value is the x axis. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. *Significant differences
  (p < 0.05) between indicated groups.
