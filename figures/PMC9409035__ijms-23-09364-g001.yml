caption: Proposed intracellular pathogenic mechanisms of ALS. (1) Oxidative stress
  caused by a multitude of factors, is believed to progress disease pathology in ALS
  patients due to the harmful side-effects of ROS build-up. (2) Build-up of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) from the dysregulation of mitochondrial function has been proposed
  as an initiating factor for ALS. Multiple ALS-linked proteins interact with cellular
  mitochondria, including SOD1, TDP-43, and FUS. (3) Overstimulation of glutamate
  receptors has been proposed as a mechanism for ALS disease pathogenesis and is the
  disease pathway targeted by the first approved ALS therapy, riluzole. (4) Impaired
  axonal transport has been implicated in ALS disease pathology, with the presence
  of protein aggregations inhibiting functional transport along microtubules. (5)
  With the impairment of proteostasis, proteins such as SOD1 and TDP-43 accumulate
  within the cytoplasm, further impeding cell health.
