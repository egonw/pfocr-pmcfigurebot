caption: The basic metabolic unit’s physiologic signaling pathway and its precursors.
  The osteocyte is the main cell responsible for osteological metabolic regulation,
  as it regulates osteoblasts through sclerostin and controls osteoclasts through
  RANKL/OPG expression. RANKL increases osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast survival
  by acting on RANK. RANKL expression and signaling are critical mechanisms for activating
  osteoclasts and driving subsequent bone remodeling through hydroxyapatite and collagen
  resorption events. RANKL—nuclear factor-kB receptor activator ligand; RANK—receptor
  located on osteoclasts; OPG—osteoprotegerin; PTH—parathyroid hormone; PTHrP—parathyroid
  hormone-related protein.
