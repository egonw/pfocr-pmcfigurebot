caption: 'Effects of coconut oil on artificial particulate matter (APM) and diesel
  exhaust particles (DEP)−induced inflammation in alveolar macrophages (MH−S). Protein
  levels of (A) tumor necrosis factor−α (TNF−α), (B) interleukin (IL)−1β, and (C)
  IL−6 in MH−S were determined using enzyme−linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). (D,E)
  Relative gene expression of inflammatory factors in APM/DEP–stimulated MH−S cells.
  Vehicle control (VC) was treated with cell medium including 10% distilled water.
  All experiments were independently performed in triplicate. * p < 0.5 or *** p <
  0.001 vs. VC; # p < 0.05 or ### p < 0.001 vs. APM; § p < 0.05 or §§ p < 0.01, §§§ p
  < 0.001 vs. DEP.'
