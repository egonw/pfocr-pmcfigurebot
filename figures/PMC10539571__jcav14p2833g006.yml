caption: 'PRMT7 interacts with PTEN and promotes PTEN methylation. A RT-qPCR was used
  to detect the expression of PTEN mRNA in the transfected cells. B Endogenous PTEN
  and PRMT7 immunoprecipitation occurred in AGS cells. C Exogenous PTEN and PRMT7
  co-immunoprecipitated in AGS cells. D AGS cells transfected with PRMT7 siRNA and
  overexpression plasmid were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation with PTEN antibody,
  followed by detection of PTEN methylation level with MMA antibody. *P < 0.05, **P
  < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 and ns: no significance.'
