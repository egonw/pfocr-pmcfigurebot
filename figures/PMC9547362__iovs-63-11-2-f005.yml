caption: Inhibition of METTL3 suppressed the state of the NF-κB signaling pathway
  in the mouse model of fungal keratitis. (A–E) The METTL3, TRAF6, p-IκB/IκB, and
  p-p65/p65 protein expression levels in corneal tissues from FK models were analyzed
  via western blotting. (F) Immunofluorescence staining of METTL3 protein in the murine
  FK model. (G) Immunofluorescence images of TRAF6 protein in corneal tissues; n =
  6; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. The scale bar indicates 70 µm.
