caption: 'Trim44 KO attenuates pathological changes in response to ISO-induced cardiac
  remodeling. (A) Representative photographs of the whole-heart transverse sections
  with H&E staining from control-saline, KO-saline, control-ISO and KO-ISO groups
  2 weeks after cessation of ISO treatment (blue scale bars: 2 mm). (B) Magnifications
  of left ventricle sections with H&E staining (black scale bars: 20 μm). (C) Magnifications
  of left ventricle sections with Masson trichrome staining (black scale bars: 20 μm).
  (D) Quantitative analysis of collagen area fraction in four groups (n=3 rats per
  group, three fields of views per rat). (E) HW/BW ratio in four groups (n=5-8 rats
  per group). (F) Magnifications of left ventricle sections with wheat germ agglutinin
  (WGA) immunofluorescence (white scale bars: 20 μm). (G) Quantitative analysis of
  cross-sectional area of cardiomyocytes in four groups (n=5-6 rats per group, 18
  fields of view per group). (H-J) Expression of Nppa and Nppb, detected using western
  blotting (H), and quantitative analysis of Nppa (I) and Nppb (J) mRNA expression
  through real-time PCR, using Gapdh for normalization (n=3 rats per group). *P<0.05,
  **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 versus respective control group (one-way ANOVA). NS, not significant.'
