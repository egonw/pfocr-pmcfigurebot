caption: Differential response to treatments based on cardiometabolic clusters. (a)
  Prevalence of cardiometabolic comorbidities in cluster 1 and 2 compared to healthy
  donors. (b) Plasma cardiovascular disease (CVD)–related proteins altered in cluster
  1 patients versus healthy donors. (c) Plasma CVD‐related proteins altered in cluster
  2 patients versus healthy donors. (d) Plasma CVD‐related proteins altered in cluster
  2 versus cluster 1. Line shows significant differences (−log10[0.05], p < 0.05).
  (e) Effect of the treatments in disease activity (DAPSA) in patients from cluster
  1 and cluster 2. (f) Effect of the treatments in body mass index in patients from
  cluster 1 and cluster 2. (g) Effect of the treatments in the levels HOMA‐IR in patients
  from cluster 1 and cluster 2. (h) Effects of the different treatments in the plasma
  levels of CVD‐related proteins in cluster 1 and cluster 2 (fold change). (i) Heatmap
  of the changes observed in the levels of plasma CVD‐related proteins after the different
  treatment in patients from cluster 1. (j) Heatmap of the changes observed in the
  levels of plasma CVD‐related proteins after the different treatment in patients
  from cluster 2. HDs, healthy donors; C.1, cluster 1; C.2, cluster 2; Apo‐B/A, apolipoprotein

  to baseline (APRE) (p < 0.05); **significant differences compared to baseline (MTX)
  (p < 0.05); ***significant differences compared to baseline (combined APRE + MTX)
  (p < 0.05).
