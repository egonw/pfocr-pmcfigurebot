caption: Disruption of myeloid-specific TXNIP promotes CYLD and activates the NRF2
  pathway in IR-stressed liver.The WT, TXNIPFL/FL, and TXNIPM-KO mice were subjected
  to 90 min of partial liver warm ischaemia, followed by 6 h of reperfusion. (A) Western-assisted
  analysis and relative density ratio of CYLD, NOX4, and NRF2 in IR-stressed livers.
  (B) Western-assisted analysis and relative density ratio of CYLD and NRF2 in the
  TXNIPFL/FL and TXNIPM-KO livers after IR stress. (C) Quantitative RT-PCR analysis
  of NQO1, GCLC, and GCLM mRNA levels in ischaemic livers (n = 6 samples/group). (D)
  Immunofluorescence staining of CYLD and CD68 in ischaemic livers (n = 6 mice/group).
  Scale bars, 100 μm. (E) The Kupffer cells were isolated from ischaemic livers, and
  then these cells were cultured for 2 h at 37 °C. Western-assisted analysis and relative
  density ratio of CYLD and nuclear NRF2 in Kupffer cells from the TXNIPFL/FL and
  TXNIPM-KO livers after IR stress. (F) The Kupffer cells (2 × 105/each group) were
  isolated from ischaemic livers and then cultured for 2 h. Detection of ROS production
  by Carboxy-H2DFFDA in Kupffer cells from the TXNIPFL/FL and TXNIPM-KO livers after
  IR stress. Quantification of ROS-producing Kupffer cells (green) (n = 6 mice/group).
  Scale bars, 200 μm. All Western blots represent 4 experiments, and the data represent
  the mean ± SD. Statistical analysis was performed using the Permutation t test.
