caption: SUMOylation in the neuron. SUMOylation plays an integral function in signal
  transduction. Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs)
  are required for proper synaptic transmission. Although AMPARs are not directly
  SUMOylated, SUMOylation is required for proper AMPAR trafficking by Arc proteins.
  N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) stimulation causes SUMOylation of neuronal
  nitric oxides synthase (nNOS), which allows signal relay from the nNOS-NO pathway
  to the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. Prevention of nNOS SUMOylation
  blocks ERK1/2 signaling. Ras SUMOylation is required for signal transduction through
  the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade. cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) SUMOylation
  increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. BDNF-TrkB signaling activates
  CREB binding through the ERK pathway. BDNF-TrkB regulates PIAS3 translocation from
  the nucleus to the dendrites. Downstream of BDNF-TrkB signaling is the P13K-Akt
  pathway. Akt is SUMOylated at two lysine residues, leading to an increase in Akt
  activity.
