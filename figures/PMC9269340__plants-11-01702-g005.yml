caption: KEGG analysis of four groups of proteins. The figure shows the top ten entries
  according to a significant degree. From left to right was the following −log(p-value)
  from a large to a small array, which meant that the closer to the left side, the
  more significant. The vertical axis represents −log (p-value). The red line indicates
  that p = 0.01, while the blue line indicates that p = 0.05. Only when the column
  is higher than the red line or blue line, does its corresponding metabolic pathway
  have significant meaning. (A) M-M, (B) M-SA, (C) R-M, (D) R-SA.
