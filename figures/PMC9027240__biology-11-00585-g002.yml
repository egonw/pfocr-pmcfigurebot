caption: Schematic illustration of signal transduction by the canonical Hedgehog signaling
  pathway. (A) In the absence of the ligand, the patched receptor (Ptch) suppresses
  Smo, leading to the generation of Gli repressor (GliR) by proteolytic cleavage of
  Gli. GliR suppresses transcription of Hedgehog target genes. (B) Binding of ligands
  to Ptch relieves the suppression of Smo by the receptor, leading to movement of
  Smo to primary cilium where it inhibits proteolysis of Gli. Uncleaved and unphosphorylated
  Gli protein translocates into the nucleus and induces transcription of Hedgehog
  target genes as Gli transcriptional activator (GliA). Ptch, Patched; Smo, Smoothened;
  Gli, Glioma-associated oncogene.
