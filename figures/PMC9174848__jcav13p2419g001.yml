caption: (A) Detection of FUZ expression by qRT-PCR. (B) Detection of FUZ expression
  using western blot analysis. (C, D) The expression of FUZ after 48 hours of transfection
  with NC and siRNA by qRT-PCR and the cell proliferation assay. S1, S2, and S3 are
  the three different siRNA sequences, and NC is negative control. (E, F) The expression
  of FUZ after 48 hours of transfection with NC and overexpression by qRT-PCR and
  the cell proliferation assay. NC is negative control. Measurements were taken from
  three independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001.
