caption: ILF3 was up-regulated in gastric cancer. (A) Expression of ILF3 mRNA in gastric
  cancer samples (n = 375) and normal samples (n = 32) from the TCGA data. (B) ILF3
  protein expression was detected by IHC. ILF3 positive staining in tumor tissues
  was increased relative to non-cancerous tissues. (C) Western blot analysis of ILF3
  in paired tumor tissues and non-cancerous tissues. The ILF3 expression level of
  mRNA was higher in cancer tissue than in normal tissues. (D) Western blot analysis
  of ILF3 protein in gastric epithelial cell line (GES-1) and gastric cancer cells
  lines (SGC-7901, HGC-27, Ncl-N87, and SNU-1). The ILF3 protein expression was significantly
  higher in gastric cancer cell lines than gastric epithelial cell line. **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.
