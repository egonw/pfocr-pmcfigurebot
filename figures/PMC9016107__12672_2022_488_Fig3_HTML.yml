caption: 'MAL2 regulates the MAPK/mTOR signaling pathway in NSCLC. A Differentially
  phosphorylated proteins between control cells and MAL2 overexpression NCI-H23 cells.
  Red and green colors, upregulated and downregulated phosphoproteins in MAL2 overexpression
  cells, respectively (FDR < 0.01 from Wilcoxon signed-rank test and fold change > 1.2).
  B Fold changes of top 15 upregulated proteins and top 5 downregulated proteins identified
  from the quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis. C Functional annotation clustering
  of proteins regulated by MAL2 in NCI-H23 cells. Enriched groups listed by their
  gene ontology term are ranked on the basis of the significant enrichment scores.
  D Left panel: immunoblotting analysis for mTOR, RPS6, AKT, and ERK phosphorylation
  in NCI-H23 cells with or without overexpression of MAL2. Right panel: immunoblotting
  analysis of mTOR, RPS6, and ERK phosphorylation after MAL2 silencing in NCI-H23
  cells stably overexpressing MAL2. E MAL2 activates mTOR through modulating ERK1/2.
  Western blot analysis of p-ERK1/2, total ERK1/2, p-mTOR, total mTOR, p-RPS6, total
  RPS6, and PCNA in A549-MAL2 cells. MEK inhibitor selumetinib (10 µmol/l), mTOR inhibitors
  rapamycin (100 nmol/l) and torin (250 nmol/l) incubated cells for 48 h'
