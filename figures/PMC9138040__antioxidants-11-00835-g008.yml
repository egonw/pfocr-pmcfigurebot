caption: 'The TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation via c-Src-driven ROS was independent
  from the EGFR signaling pathway. (a,b) Cells were pre-treated with NAC, DPI, APO,
  or PP1, followed by TNF-α treatment for various times. (a) IκBα and (b) NF-κB activation
  was analyzed by Western blotting. (c,d) Cells were pre-treated with AG1478, LY294002,
  or BML257, followed by TNF-α treatment for 5 min. NF-κB activation was analyzed
  by (c) Western blotting and (d) immunofluorescence staining. The results are presented
  as the mean ± SD from 4–6 experiments and analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed
  by Dunnett’s post hoc test. **p < 0.01, compared with the untreated group. #p <
  0.05, ##p < 0.01, compared with the TNF-α treatment group.'
