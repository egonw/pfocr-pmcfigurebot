caption: CYP27C1-knockdown attenuates anticancer potency of protein kinase inhibitors.
  (Aâ€“E) A549-shCYP27C1, H1975-shCYP27C1, and the corresponding control cells were
  treated with indicated concentration of protein kinase inhibitors (picropodophyllin,
  pacritinib, and SKLB610). Real-time cell index reflecting cell viability were detected
  by RTCA-S16 System. Results were analyzed by two-way ANOVA. ****, p <0.0001, **,
  p <0.01, *, p < 0.05, n.s., p > 0.05. (F) Stable CYP27C1-knockdown H1975 cells and
  the corresponding control cells were treated with indicated concentrations of SKLB610,
  cell viability was determined by MTS assay at different time point, and analyzed
  by two-way ANOVA. ****, p <0.0001.
