caption: ST2825 inhibits MyD88 dimerization to inactivate the NF-κB pathways in pancreatic
  ductal adenocarcinoma cells. (A and B) RT-qPCR and western blot analysis were used
  to determine the relative expression of MyD88 in PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cells treated
  with ST2825. (C) Western blot analysis was used to determine the expression of myc
  and Flag following transfection with plasmids of Myc-MyD88 and Flag-MyD88 in PANC-1
  and BxPC-3 cells treated with ST2825. (D) Western blot analysis was used to determine
  the expression of Myc-MyD88 from the co-IP of Flag-complex following transfection
  with plasmids of Myc-MyD88 and Flag-MyD88 in PANC-1 cells treated with ST2825. (E
  and F) Hierarchical clustering and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment
  analysis based on the expression profiles of significantly differentially expressed
  proteins between negative control and ST2825 groups of the PANC-1 cells. (G and
  H) RT-qPCR analysis was used to determine the relative expression of RELA(p65) in
  PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cells treated with ST2825. (I and J) Western blot analysis was
  used to determine the expression of p65, phosphorylated-p65 and the ratio of phosphorylated-p65/p65
  in PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cells treated with ST2825. All experiments were performed in
  triplicate and the data are presented as the mean ± SD. The t-test with the Bonferroni
  test was used for statistical analysis, *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001; N.S.,
  not significant. MyD88, myeloid differentiation factor 88; RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR; NC, negative control; ST, ST2825.
