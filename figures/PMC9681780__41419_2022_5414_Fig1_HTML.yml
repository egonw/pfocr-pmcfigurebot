figure_title: Identification and validation of PRSS22 as a tumor-associated gene in
  BC
caption: 'A PRSS22 expression is markedly elevated in human BC samples compared with
  normal tissues from the TCGA databases using UALCAN (BRCA: Breast invasive carcinoma,
  Comparison: Normal-vs-Primary tumor, Statistical significance:1.6244783296E-12).
  B The expression of PRSS22 in tumor tissues (n = 14) and paired non-tumor tissues
  (n = 14) detected by RT-qPCR (t test, P = 0.0056). C The expression of PRSS22 in
  tumor tissues with lymph node metastasis (LNM) (n = 20) and without LNM (n = 18)
  detected by RT-qPCR (t test, P = 0.019). The median expression of each group was
  indicated by horizontal lines. D–G The expression of PRSS22 was confirmed immunohistochemically
  in BC paraffin-embedded samples. PRSS22-positive staining was predominantly localized
  in the cytoplasm and membrane. PRSS22 is negative in normal gastric mucosa, weak
  intensity with low positivity rate in primary BC tissues without LNM, strong intensity
  with high positivity rate in primary BC tissues with LNM (magnification ×200, Scale
  bars, 50 μm). H Immunohistochemistry showed that PRSS22 expression is significantly
  upregulated in BC tissues compared with nontumorous breast tissues (P < 0.0001).
  I Compared with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), the expression of PRSS22 in invasive
  ductal carcinoma (IDC) of BC tissues increased significantly (P = 0.0118). J Immunohistochemistry
  showed that PRSS22 expression is significantly upregulated in molecular classification
  of triple-negative BC (P < 0.05). K Area under the receiver operator characteristic
  (ROC) curve for PRSS22 in differential diagnosis of BC with and without LNM (AUC = 0.6984,
  P = 0.0012). L, M The expression of PRSS22 in triple-negative metastatic cell lines
  (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-453) and luminal cell lines (T47D and MCF-7)
  were performed by RT-qPCR (L) and Western blot (M). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001,
  ns not significant.'
