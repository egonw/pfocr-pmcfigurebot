caption: Biological changes in cancer cells adapt to hypoxia. Hypoxia promotes carcinogenesis
  by inducing DNA strand breaks, including DNA DSB and SSB, and by weakening DNA repair
  pathways, such as HR and MMR. HIF-1α is upgraded by PI3K-mTOR, JAK-STAT3, NF-κB,
  MAPK, Wnt/β-catenin, and Notch pathway. Deletion of tumor suppressor genes, such
  as p53, PTEN, and ROS production, also contributes to the upregulation of HIF-1α.
  The loss of pVHL function under hypoxic conditions indirectly leads to HIF-1α accumulation.
  HIF-1α dimerizes with HIF-1β and enters the nucleus to bind to HRE, which regulates
  various downstream target genes (Table ) to promote cancer cell proliferation, migration,
  invasion, EMT and angiogenesis
