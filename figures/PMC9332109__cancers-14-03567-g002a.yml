caption: 'The protein profile differs in AML-SCs compared with HSCs and HPCs. (a)
  PCA of AML-SC and healthy immature cell subset protein expression pattern. Color-coding
  and the sample ID of the AML-SCs are indicated. The AML-SCs from pAML17 and pAML21
  were situated in close relation to healthy HSCs as opposed to AML-SCs from pAML20,
  pAML23, and pAML29; the latter two did not map near the healthy counterparts. (b)
  Volcano plot displaying proteins variably expressed between AML-SCs and HSCs. In
  all, 34 proteins were differentially expressed (p-value < 0.05). Upregulated proteins:
  red spheres. Downregulated proteins: green spheres. The gray lines indicate a p-value
  of < 0.05. The labeled proteins are listed in . (c) Ingenuity pathway analysis of
  the 34 proteins differentially expressed in AML-SCs. The observed changes in protein
  expression levels are indicated in red (upregulated) and green (downregulated) shown
  in the periphery. Upstream analysis in IPA revealed seven putative regulators that
  could explain this (inner circle of proteins). Six of the seven proteins are transcription
  factors, while one (SFPQ) is a splicing factor, all participating in gene expression.
  Decreased activity of one of the transcription factors (MLXIPL, blue) could explain
  the significant downregulation of the “signaling through EIF2” pathway identified
  in the IPA analysis. Stippled lines: indirect relationship. Solid line: direct relationship
