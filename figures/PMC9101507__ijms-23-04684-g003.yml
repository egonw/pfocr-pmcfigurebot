caption: 'Interplay of Dlg-module, endocytosis and EGFR signaling in squamous cyst
  cells of the Drosophila testis. (A) Early spermatogenesis in Drosophila. Germline
  stem cells (GSCs) and somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs) are anchored to the anterior
  hub cells of the niche (grey). Upon asymmetric division, a GSC gives rise to a distally
  located daughter germ cell that initiates 4 transit amplifying (TA) mitotic divisions,
  creating cysts of interconnected spermatogonia. At 16-cell stage spermatogonia exit
  the mitotic program, turn on the pre-meiotic transcription program, grow enormously
  and become spermatocytes. CySCs divide giving rise to daughter squamous cyst cells
  (SCCs), which encapsulate as a pair the germ cells up to sperm individualization.
  Early SCCs encapsulate spermatogonia, late SCCs encapsulate spermatocytes. (B) Dlg
  (red) and EGFR (green) localize in SCCs. Image frame: 123 μm. (C) Columnar epithelia
  have distinct apical, basal and lateral domains. Squamous epithelial cells lack
  lateral membranes and show the close proximity of apical vs. basal membranes. (D)
  EGFR in SCCs (green) is activated upon binding of the EGF ligand Spitz, emanating
  from the germline (purple). Activated EGFR signals back to the germline by sending
  a (unidentified) “GO differentiation” signal that promotes progressive germline
  differentiation. Loss of Dlg, Scrib or Lgl function in SCCs, leads to overactivation
  of the EGFR signaling that sends now a “Death signal” to the germ cells (dying germ
  cells shown in black). The Dlg-module could attenuate EGFR signaling by (1) cooperating
  with components of the clathrin-mediated endocytic (CME) pathway, (2) binding and
  inactivating components of the MAPK/Ras pathway (acting in parallel to the function
  of CME components), (3) facilitating the polarized distribution of the EGFR on the
  basal side of SCCs, away from the apical surfaces that face the germ cells secreting
  the EGF ligand. To simplify the diagram, only Dlg is depicted in (B,C).'
