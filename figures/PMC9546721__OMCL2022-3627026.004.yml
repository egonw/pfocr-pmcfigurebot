caption: PERK-ATF4 signaling pathway is involved in hypoxia-induced apoptosis of NSCs
  and regulates the expression of CIRBP. (a) Changes in expression of PERK-ATF4 signaling
  pathway-related protein levels in C17.2-NSCs following 48-hour hypoxic exposure.
  (b) PERK and eif2α levels did not change significantly, while p-PERK, p-eif2α, CHOP,
  and ATF4 levels increased apparently in C17.2-NSCs after hypoxic exposure after
  48 h, n = 3. (c) Detection of the changes in the expression of PERK-ATF4 signaling
  pathway-related molecular proteins in C17.2-NSCs after hypoxic exposure after 48 h
  combined with 10 nM GSK2606414 or DMSO treatment. (d) The ratio of p-PERK/PERK protein
  levels. This ratio was significantly reduced in the hypoxic exposure-and-GSK2606414
  treatment group compared to the hypoxic exposure, n = 3. (e) The ratio of p-eif2α/eif2α
  protein levels. This ratio was significantly decreased in the hypoxic exposure-and-GSK2606414
  treatment group compared to the hypoxic exposure, n = 3. (f) Changes in CHOP and
  ATF4 protein levels. Those levels were both significantly reduced in the hypoxic
  exposure-and-GSK2606414 treatment group compared to the hypoxic exposure-and-DMSO
  treatment group, n = 3. (g) Detection of the apoptosis in C17.2-NSCs under hypoxic
  exposure and 10 nM GSK2606414 or DMSO treatment for 48 h. (h) Compared with hypoxic
  exposure and DMSO, the GSK2606414 treatment group showed a decrease in apoptotic
  cells, n = 3. (i) Detection of changes in CIRBP and aCasp3 protein levels in C17.2-NSCs
  exposed to hypoxia and 10 nM GSK2606414 or DMSO treatment for 48 h. (j) Hypoxia
  and GSK2606414 treatment significantly increased CIRBP protein levels compared to
  hypoxia and DMSO treatment, n = 3. (k) The protein level of aCasp3 was significantly
  increased in the hypoxic exposure-and-GSK2606414 treatment group compared to the
  hypoxic exposure-and-DMSO treatment group, n = 3. (l) Detection of changes in CIRBP
  and aCasp3 protein levels in C17.2-NSCs treated with 2 μg/mL Tunicamycin or DMSO
  for 0 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, and 48 h. (m) Tunicamycin treatment prolonged for
  12 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours, and 48 hours gradually reduced CIRBP levels, n = 3.
  (n) Incubation with Tunicamycin for 12 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours, and 48 hours significantly
  increased the level of aCasp3 protein, n = 3. Comparison of exploring time on novel
  objects is indicated by asterisks.
