caption: 'SGLT2 as a target gene regulated by miR-296. (a, b) We used qRT-PCR to detect
  the expression of SGLT2 in the kidney tissue and the cells of each group. High-glucose
  group (high-glucose medium containing D-glucose: 25 mmol/L). (c, d QRT-PCR was used
  to detect the effect of the miR-296 mimic and miR-296 inhibitor on the expression
  of SGLT2. (e, f) QRT-PCR and western blotting were used to detect the effect of
  inhibiting circ_000166 on the expression of SGLT2. The data are expressed as mean
  ± standard. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001.'

  by Regulating the SGLT2 Signaling Pathway in Renal Tubular Epithelial Cells.
