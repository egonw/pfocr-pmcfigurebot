caption: Metabolite pathway analysis using Fisher's exact test and the Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathway database. (A) Venn diagram of significant
  pathways unique to non‐fatigued (left), fatigued (right), and overlap between non‐fatigued
  and fatigued participants with cancer compared to controls. (B) Overrepresented
  pathways of metabolites that were only significantly different between fatigued
  cancer versus healthy controls. The x‐axis represents pathway impact, and the y‐axis
  represents ‐log(p). (C) Overrepresented pathways of metabolites that were only significantly
  different between non‐fatigued cancer versus healthy controls. The x‐axis represents
  pathway impact, and the y‐axis represents ‐log(p). (D) Overlap of overrepresented
  pathways between the two comparisons. The x‐axis represents pathway impact, and
  the y‐axis represents ‐log(p). Gray scale gradient and circle size indicate the
  significance of the pathway ranked by p‐value and pathway impact score. Statistically
  significant pathways are annotated (p < 0.05)
