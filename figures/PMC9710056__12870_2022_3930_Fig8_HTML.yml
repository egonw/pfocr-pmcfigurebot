caption: Schematic diagram showing melatonin application effects on salt stressed
  upland cotton seedlings. Exogenous melatonin application improved plant biomass
  and growth while reducing the mortality rate. The mechanisms that helped cotton
  seedlings to cope with salt stress include increased photosynthesis, ROS scavenging,
  Na+/K+ homeostasis, flavonoid, glutathione, and linoleic acid accumulation. Large-scale
  transcriptomic changes in the plant hormone signal transduction pathway were observed
article_title: Combined transcriptome and metabolome analysis revealed pathways involved
  in improved salt tolerance of Gossypium hirsutum L. seedlings in response to exogenous
  melatonin application.
