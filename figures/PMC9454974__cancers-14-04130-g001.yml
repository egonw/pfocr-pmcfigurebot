caption: The HIF degradation pathway. Under normoxic conditions, HIF-1α undergoes
  hydroxylation via PHDs which require oxygen. This hydroxylation allows HIF to be
  preferentially recognised by the VHL protein which targets the protein for ubiquitylation-dependent
  proteasomal degradation. In hypoxic environments, HIF-1α is not targeted for hydroxylation
  and degradation, therefore accumulates and is translocated into the nucleus. Once
  in the nucleus, it can form a heterodimer with HIF-1β which binds to the hypoxia
  response elements (HRE) on the target genes to initiate their transcription. Figure
