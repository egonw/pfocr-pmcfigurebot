caption: 'MgIG improves HRZE-induced intestinal barrier function. (a–c) The protein
  levels of ZO-1 and occludin in colon tissues were analyzed by Western blot assays
  (n = 3 per group); (d) representative images of colon H&E staining in each group—the
  asterisk means inflammatory cell infiltration and the arrow means significantly
  shorter crypt depth. The data are presented as the means ± SEM. Compared with the
  control group: ** p < 0.01. Compared with the HRZE group: #p < 0.05.'
