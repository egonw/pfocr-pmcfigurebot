figure_title: ALDH1L2 interacts with TXN
caption: a Results of LC-MS. b Co-IP identified the interaction between ALDH1L2 and
  TXN. c IF analysis of the co-localisation of ALDH1L2 (green) and TXN (red) in SW480
  and HT-29 cell lines with ALDH1L2 overexpression. Nucleus was labelled with DAPI
  (blue). d–g Transcript level of TXN in CRC cell lines with different ALDH1L2 expressions.
  h MG132 (20 μM, 24 h) treatment on HCT 116 and HCT-15 cells with/without ALDH1L2
  knockdown. i MG132 (20 μM, 24 h) treatment on SW480 and HT-29 cells with/without
  ALDH1L2 overexpression. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
