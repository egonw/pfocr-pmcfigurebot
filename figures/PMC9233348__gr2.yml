caption: COVID-19 and cytokine storm, focusing on IL-6IL-1b and TNF, as acute-response
  cytokines, and MCP-1 and IL-8, chemotactic cytokines, increase hypercytokinemia,
  which elevates IL-6. The IL-6/IL-6R acts on gp130 to increase IL-6, MCP-1, and GM-CSF
  by activating the JAK-STAT pathway. IL-6, GM-CSF, and MCP-1 may activate an acute-phase
  response indicated by a high serum ferritin, CRP, and pro-coagulant factors in paraclinical
  tests. Three IL-6 signal transductions of trans-presentation, trans-signal transduction,
  and classical signal transduction. IL-6/mIL-6R complex contributes to the classical
  signal transduction mode, which mediates anti-inflammatory function. IL-6 trans-signaling
  is more related to inflammatory processes. In this signaling, IL-6 binds to the
  sIL-6R. This leads to the production of VEGF, MCP-1, IL-8, IL-6, and E-cadherin.
  Expression in ECs is reduced. This increases vascular permeability and exacerbates
  the cytokine storm. IL-6 trans-presentation signaling pathway is a juxtracrine mechanism
  that contributes to dendritic and T cell interactions. mIL-6R, membrane-bound form
  of Interleukin-6 Receptor; CRP, C-reactive protein.
