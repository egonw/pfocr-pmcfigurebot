caption: 'TNFα expression in pre-symptomatic APP/PS1 retina. (A) Transcriptional analysis
  by qPCR (WT n = 4:2F + 2M; TG n = 6:3F + 3M). (B) Analysis of protein expression
  by western blot with quantification performed after normalization over β-actin,
  used as a loading control (WT n = 7:3F + 4M; TG n = 6: 3F + 3M). (C) ELISA TNFα
  (WT n = 5:4F + 1M; TG n = 5:3F + 2M) Student’s t-test unpaired non-parametric two
  tailed (Mann–Whitney) * p < 0.05.'
