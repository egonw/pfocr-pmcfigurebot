caption: The differential expression and functional pathway analysis in GSE57338 dataset.
  A The volcano map showing the differential expressed genes between the control and
  DCM samples. Green dots are down-regulated DEGs and red dots are up-regulated DEGs.
  B The GSEA analysis shown the maps of cGMP metabolic process, oxygen transport,
  NAD metabolic process, linoleic acid metabolic process, long-chain fatty acid binding,
  and phosphatidylethanolamine metabolic process were significantly enriched. The
  color bar indicates the corrected p value of the enrichment pathway. The size of
  the dot indicates the number of enriched genes. C The heatmap showing the patterns
  of the GSVA score of the KEGG pathway, and the metabolism- related maps were significantly
  identified. D The purine metabolism- related maps were detected based on GSEA analysis
