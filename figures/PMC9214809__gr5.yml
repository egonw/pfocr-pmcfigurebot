caption: Role of Fgf21 in the regulation of Cyp7a1 expression in primary mouse hepatocytes.A,
  primary mouse hepatocytes were treated with recombinant Fgf21 protein (500 nM) for
  4 h and mRNA expression of Cyp7a1 was examined. B, primary mouse hepatocytes were
  treated with recombinant Fgf21 protein (500 nM) for 10 min, and immunoblots with
  anti-pJNK and anti-JNK antibodies were performed. C, primary mouse hepatocytes were
  treated with Fgf21 protein (500 nM) in combination with the JNK inhibitor SP600125
  (40 μM) for 4 h. D, primary mouse hepatocytes were treated with seladelpar in combination
  with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (40 μM) for 48 h. qPCR data are presented as mean ±
  S.E.M. of at least three independent replicates. ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01 denote
  the significant difference between the groups. JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase.
