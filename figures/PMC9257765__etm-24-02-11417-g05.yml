caption: AGMAT induces EMT in PAAD cells and accelerates the process induced by the
  TGFβ/Smad signaling pathway. The protein expression levels of TGFβ1, Smad4 and p-Smad2/3
  were detected by western blot analysis in (A) SW1990 cells with AGMAT-overexpression
  (OE) and (B) BxPc3 cells with AGMAT-knockdown (sh-AGMAT). Data are represented as
  mean ± SEM of three independent experiments. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 vs. the
  Vector or sh-NC group. AGMAT, agmatinase; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition;
  PAAD, pancreatic adenocarcinoma; TGFβ, transforming growth factor-β; p-, phosphorylated.
article_title: Agmatinase facilitates the tumorigenesis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma
  through the TGFβ/Smad pathway.
