caption: Network pharmacological analysis of WP active components and targets of obesity
  and inflammatory diseases. (A) TIC plot of WP detected by LC-MS/MS (n=3), (B) Venn
  diagram of the intersection of WP active ingredient targets of action with targets
  of obesity and inflammation, (C) CytoHubb screening of the top 50 core targets of
  WP active ingredient targets of action with targets of obesity and inflammation,
  (D) GO enrichment analysis results, (E) KEGG enrichment analysis results, (F) AMWP-core
  target-KEGG pathway network diagram (rectangle is the AMWP corresponding to the
  50 core targets, circle is the 50 core targets, inverted triangle is the signaling
  pathway, the larger the node area, the higher the representation value, the more
  important the node is in the network).
