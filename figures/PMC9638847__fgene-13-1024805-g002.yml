caption: 'Characterization of enriched Sertoli cells by RNA sequencing. (A) Heatmap
  of testicular cell markers in enriched Sertoli cells, ordered by cell type-specificity
  including Sertoli cells, spermatogenic cells (spermatogonia, spermatocyte, round
  and elongated spermatid), immune cells (lymphoid and macrophage), endothelial cells,
  smooth muscle cells (peritubular myoid) and endocrine cells (Leydig). Color scale
  indicates normalized log2 gene counts per million (CPM). Enriched (B) KEGG and (C)
  GO pathways for 100 most highly expressed genes in collected Sertoli cells including
  immunological (e.g. KEGG: Antigen processing and presentation; GO MF: MHC class
  II protein binding), metabolic (e.g. KEGG: Oxidative phosphorylation, GO CC: respiratory
  chain complex), cell-cell junction (KEGG: Cardiac muscle contraction, GO, CC: anchoring
  junction), phagocytosis (GO, CC: endocytic vesicle lumen, lysosomal lumen), and
  secretion (KEGG: protein processing in ER, GO, CC: secretory granule) pathways.
  Ratio of genes per pathway is given on the x-axis and log of p-value (log(p)) is
  indicated on a color scale. BP: biological process, CC: cellular component, MF:
  molecular function.'
