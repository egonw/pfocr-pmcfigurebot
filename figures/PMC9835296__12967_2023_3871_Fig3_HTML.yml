caption: 'High AFAP1L1 expression in GC promotes proliferation, invasion in vitro
  and growth, metastasis in vivo. A The cell proliferative curves were plotted by
  CCK8 assays for AGSshAFAP1L1, MKN74AFAP1L1 and their control cells. B The representative
  images and the quantification of colony formation assays from AGSshAFAP1L1, MKN74AFAP1L1
  and their control cells. C Edu assays showed the proliferating cells in AGSshAFAP1L1,
  MKN74AFAP1L1 and their control groups. The percentage of proliferating cells was
  compared in corresponding bar graphs. Scale bars, 50 μm. D Double fluorescent staining
  of cytoskeleton (red) and AFAP1L1 (green) for indicated GC cells. Cytoskeleton was
  stained by rhodamine phalloidin and Nuclei was stained with DAPI (blue). Scale bars,
  10 μm. E, F The influence of AFAP1L1 overexpression or knockdown on GC cells migratory
  and invasive capacity was determined by transwell migration (E) and invasion assays
  (F). Scale bars, 50 μm. G Subcutaneous tumor model was constructed to test the effect
  of AFAP1L1 overexpression or knockdown on GC cells growth in vivo. The final tumor
  volumes were compared in right bar graphs. H In vivo metastatic assays by tail vein
  injection of indicated GC cells and representative H&E staining images of pulmonary
  and intrahepatic metastases. FC: fold change. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001'
