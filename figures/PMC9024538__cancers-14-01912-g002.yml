caption: Wnt/β-Catenin-independent signaling. Two non-canonical β-catenin-independent
  Wnt signaling pathways have been reported, both of which are activated by binding
  of a Wnt ligand to Fz proteins and their co-receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan
  receptor 2 (ROR2) to activate Dishevelled (Dvl). (a) The planar cell polarity (PCP)
  pathway mediates cell adhesion, migration, and cytoskeleton organization. Activation
  of a trimeric G protein induces activation of Dvl and DAAM, which downstream activate
  the small GTPases RHOA and RAC-1 and the kinases JUN (JNK) and ROCK. The signal
  is amplified by the activation of JNK, which phosphorylates the transcription factors
  AP-1 and JUN that translocate into the nucleus and regulate gene expression. (b)
  The Wnt/Ca2+signaling pathway is mediated by G proteins with activation of phospholipase
  C, leading to hydrolysis of PIP2 to DAG and IP3. IP3 induces the diffusion of Ca2+
  ions from within the compartments in which they are stored into the cytoplasm to
  activate calcineurin and CAMKII. Intracellular calcium and DAG activate protein
  kinase C (PKC) by increasing calcineurin activity, which causes translocation of
  the transcriptional factor NFAT into the nucleus and target genes transcription.
