caption: Lycium barbarum polysaccharide may act via the SIRT3/CypD pathway to reverse
  the hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced inhibition of proliferation in H9c2 cells. (A)
  The CCK-8 assay was performed to assess the proliferation of H9c2 cells. (B) EdU
  staining was used to determine the proliferation of H9c2 cells (scale bar =50 µm;
  magnification, ×40) (C,D) Western blotting was used to detect the protein expressions
  of proliferation biomarkers. N=3, mean ± standard deviation; *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01;
  ***, P<0.001. One-way ANOVA was used for analysis of variance among multiple groups.
  Tukey’s test was used for pairwise comparisons between groups. LBP, Lycium barbarum
  polysaccharide; H/R, hypoxia/reoxygenation; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen;
  CCK-8, Cell Counting Kit-8; ANOVA, analysis of variance.
