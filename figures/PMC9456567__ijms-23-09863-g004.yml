caption: '(A–C) Effects of α-boswellic acid on the MAP kinases signaling pathway in
  TNF-α/IFN-γ-induced HaCaT cells. HaCaT cells were pretreated with different concentrations
  of α-boswellic acid (1, 3, and 10 μM) for 20 min, and then the cells were treated
  with TNF-α/IFN-γ for 30 min. Western blots were analyzed quantitatively. Values
  represent the mean ± SEM from the three independent experiments. ## p < 0.01 compared
  with the no-treatment condition; * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 compared with the only
  TNF-α/IFN-γ treatment condition.'
