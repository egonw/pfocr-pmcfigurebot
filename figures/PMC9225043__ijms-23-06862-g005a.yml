caption: 'Expressions of mAChRs and key mediators within mAChRs downstream signaling
  pathway in the mid colon of C3 KO mice. (a) mAChR M2 and M3 expression. The expression
  levels of mAChR M2 and M3 were measured by Western blot analysis using the specific
  primary antibodies and HRP-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibody. (b) Gα expression.
  The expression levels of Gα in the mAChR M2 and M3 downstream signaling pathway
  were measured by Western blot analysis using the specific primary antibodies and
  HRP-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibody. (c) PKC, p-PKC, PI3K, p-PI3K, MLC, and p-MLC
  expression. The expression levels of six proteins in the mAChR M2 and M3 downstream
  signaling pathway were measured by Western blot analysis using the specific primary
  antibodies and HRP-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibody. After the intensity of each
  band was determined using an imaging densitometer, the relative levels of the four
  proteins were calculated on the basis of the intensity of β-actin. Four mice per
  group were used to prepare the total tissue homogenate, and Western blot analyses
  were assayed in duplicate. Data are reported as the mean ± SD. * p < 0.05 compared
  to the WT group. Abbreviations: WT, wildtype; KO, knockout; mAChR, muscarinic acetylcholine
  receptors; Gα, G-protein alpha subunit; PKC, protein kinase C; PI3K, phosphoinositide
  3-kinase; MLC, myosin light chain; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; IgG, immunoglobulin
