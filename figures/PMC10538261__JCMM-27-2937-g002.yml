caption: GSEA analysis. Six pathways, including histone modifications (A), response
  to azacitidine (B), mRNA splicing (C), ERB pathway (D), VDR pathway (E) and regulation
  of TP53 activity through acetylation (F), showed significant differential enrichment
  in titin (TTN) low expression phenotype based on normalized enrichment score (NES),
  nominal p value and false discovery rate value.
