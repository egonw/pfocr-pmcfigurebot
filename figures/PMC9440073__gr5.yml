caption: Irradiation promotes the production of exosomes by increasing the interaction
  of phosphorylated ATM (p-ATM) with ALIX. (A) The top 26 significant genes that correlate
  positively with ATM in GBM are shown in heat maps. (B) The genes correlated with
  ATM were subjected to KEGG pathway analysis. (C) Enrichment plots from GSEA showing
  that vesicle organization and immune response were differentially enriched in the
  high ATM expression phenotype. (D) The levels of ALIX and p-ATM in irradiated GBM
  cells were measured using western blotting. (E) ALIX and ATM interact with each
  other. Myc-ATM and/or HA-ALIX were overexpressed in HEK293T cells. Co-IP was performed
  by incubating whole-cell lysates (200 μg) with either an anti-Myc or anti-HA antibodies
  (top and middle). Endogenous ALIX and ATM interact with each other in LN229 (F)
  and GBM tissue (G) were validated by Co-IP assay. (H) irradiation enhances the ATM–ALIX
  complex. ALIX and ATM were co-expressed in HEK293T cells for 24 h. The whole-cellular
  lysates (200 μg) were immunoprecipitated using an anti-Myc antibody, and the precipitates
  were detected using an anti-HA antibody. (I) KU55993 blocks the irradiation-induced
  formation of ALIX-ATM complexes. HEK293T cells were treated by KU55993, and Co-IP
  was performed by incubating whole-cell lysates (200 μg) with an anti-Myc antibodies.
  (J and K) The production of exosomes from irradiated LN229 cells treated by KU55993
  (J) or ALIX shRNA (K) was measured by western blotting for exosomal markers. Exosomes
  were purified from equal number of cells and an equal volume of cell culture.
