caption: 'WNT signaling and metabolic phenotypes in MUC5AC-high tumor cells of cholangiocarcinoma.
  A: Top 40 enriched signaling pathways of the differentially expressed genes in MUC5AC-high
  cells; B: Relative activity of the WNT signaling pathway among MUC5AC-high, MUC5AC-low,
  myeloid cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and lymphocytes; C: Violin plots
  showing relative expression levels of WNT7A, WNT7B, and MMP7 in MUC5AC-high vs MUC5AC-low
  cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cells; D: Correlation analysis between the expression of
  MUC5AC and WNT7B in CCA tumor samples from cohort 10; E: Gene set enrichment analysis
  plot showing the enrichment of genes from the MUC5AC-high (left) and MUC5AC-low
  (right) cells in tumor metastasis signaling pathway. The P value and normalized
  enrichment score are indicated on the plot.'
