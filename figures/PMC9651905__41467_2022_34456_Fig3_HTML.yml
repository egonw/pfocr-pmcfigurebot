figure_title: Pathway and gene set enrichment analyses
caption: a Pathway enrichment analysis for genes at the significant GWAS loci (two-sided
  enrichment test P-values). b Gene-set enrichment for genes that cause abnormal IgA
  level. c abnormal immune tolerance; and (d) abnormal response to infection when
  genetically manipulated in mice. The y-axis shows the fixed effects meta-analysis
  –log10 (P-value) for the variant with the lowest two-sided unadjusted P-value in
  each candidate gene. The dashed line corresponds to genome-wide significance (P
  = 5 × 10−8). Enrichment P-value corresponds to the two-sided Fisher exact test comparing
  the observed number of genes with association signals below the genome-wide threshold
  against the number expected under binomial distribution.
