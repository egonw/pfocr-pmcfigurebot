caption: Antioxidant capacity and inflammatory factors expressed in the mammary gland.
  Proteins expressions were detected with ELISA kits. RT-qPCR was used to verify mRNA
  expression. GAPDH was used as a control. (A) The measurement of oxidative damage
  and antioxidant capacity. (B) The detection of TGF-β-associated inflammatory signaling
  pathway. (C) The proteins expressions of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6. CG, control group,
  milk duct perfusion with 6 mg/kg normal saline. TG, tea polyphenols group, milk
  duct perfusion 6 mg/kg tea polyphenols. The asterisk represents the comparison with
  CG, and p < 0.05 is significantly different from CG. The experimental data represent
  the mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
