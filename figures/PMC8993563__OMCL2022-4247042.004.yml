caption: 'COS inhibited oxidative stress in H2O2-stimulated KGN cells. (a) The protein
  expressions of 4-HNE and 8-OHdG after COS treatment. (b) The statistics histogram
  of western blotting is expressed as band density normalized versus actin. (c) Influence
  of COS on cellular GSH. (d) The cellular production of ROS determined by a fluorescent
  probe. (e) The statistics histogram of immunofluorescence expressed fluorescent
  intensity. Data are presented as the means ± SEM (n = 3). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01,
  or ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. the control group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, or ###P < 0.001 vs.
  the H2O2 group. Scale bar: 100 μm.'
