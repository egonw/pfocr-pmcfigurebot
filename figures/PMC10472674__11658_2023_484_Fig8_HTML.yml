caption: 'ERK signaling participated in the effects of UGCG and B4GalT5 on heart hypertrophy.
  A, C Representative western blots and statistical analysis histogram reflecting
  ERK signaling in hearts. B, D Representative western blots and statistical analysis
  histogram reflecting ERK signaling in cardiomyocytes in vitro. E, G Representative
  western blots and statistical analysis histogram reflecting ERK signaling in hearts
  from different group. F, H Representative western blots and statistical analysis
  histogram reflecting ERK signaling in cardiomyocytes in vitro (N = 3). I, K Representative
  western blots and statistical analysis histogram reflecting ERK signaling in hearts.
  J, L Representative western blots and statistical analysis histogram reflecting
  ERK signaling in cardiomyocytes in vitro. M–O Western blot assays showed the expressions
  of ANP and BNP in the presence of PD98059, an ERK signaling inhibitor. N = 3, *p < 0.05,
