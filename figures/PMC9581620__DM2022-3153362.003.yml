caption: The role of p53 in YTHDF2 regulating M1/M2 macrophage polarization. (a, b)
  p53 mRNA and protein expression were explored through qRT-PCR as well as western
  blotting within M1 macrophages before and after YTHDF2 knockdown, with GAPDH being
  the endogenous reference. (c, d) p53 mRNA and protein expression were decided through
  qRT-PCR as well as western blotting within M2 macrophages before and after YTHDF2
  knockdown, with GAPDH being the endogenous reference. (e, f) p53 mRNA and protein
  expression were detected via qRT-PCR together with WB after stimulation with PFT-α
  in YTHDF2-silenced M2 macrophages. (g, h) IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and ARG1 mRNA levels
  in YTHDF2-silenced M1/M2 macrophages with or without PFT-α were determined through
  qRT-PCR, with GAPDH being the endogenous reference. (i, j) IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and
  TGF-β protein levels within YTHDF2-silenced M1/M2 macrophages with or without PFT-α
  were evaluated through ELISA. Results are revealed by mean ± S.E.M. (n = 3). ∗P
  < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01.
