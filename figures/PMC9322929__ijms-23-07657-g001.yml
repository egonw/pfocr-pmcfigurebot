caption: 'JIB-04 inhibits cell proliferation in a time-dependent manner and causes
  G1-phase cell-cycle arrest. (A) The viability of HCC cells cultured after treatment
  with DMSO (mock control), 6 μM JIB-04, or 4 μM TSA for indicated intervals was analyzed
  by CCK assay. The error bars indicate standard deviation; n = 3 in PLC/PRF/5, Huh7,
  and HepG2 cells. (B) (Top panels) Representative histograms of the cell cycle phase
  distribution in PLC/PRF/5, Huh7, and HepG2 cells after treatment with DMSO (control)
  or 6 μM JIB-04 for 24 h. Cells were stained with propidium iodide to detect their
  DNA content. (Bottom panels) Bar graphs representing relative cell populations in
  cell cycle phases G1, S, and G2/M. The data demonstrate JIB-04-dependent effects
  on cell cycle phases. Data are represented as mean ± SEM derived from triplicate
  measurements. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 (DMSO vs. JIB-04); # p
  < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, and ### p < 0.001 (DMSO vs. TSA positive control).'
