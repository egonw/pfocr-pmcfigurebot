caption: The mechanism of NAT10 in hematological malignanciesIn AML, NAT10 influences
  the cell cycle by increasing the expression of p16 and p21 through cyclins like
  CDK2, CDK4, cyclin D1, and cyclin E; NAT10 causes endoplasmic reticulum stress,
  activates Bim and PUMA, interferes the Bax/Bcl-2-caspase-3/9 pathway, and promotes
  apoptosis. In MM, NAT10 influences CEP170 mRNA ac4C to enhance proliferation, and
  stimulates the PI3K-AKT-Bcl-xl-Bax pathway to alter the cell cycle.
