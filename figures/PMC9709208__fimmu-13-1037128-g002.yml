caption: Analysis of the DEGs and functional enrichment analysis in different ICD
  clusters. (A) Volcano plot displays the DEGs between the high and low ICD expression
  groups in the TCGA cohort. (B) Heatmap of the DEGs expression between the high and
  low ICD expression groups. (C, D) The dots (C) and circle plots (D) of GO signaling
  pathway enrichment analysis. (E) The dots plot of KEGG signaling pathway enrichment
  analysis. The size of the dot represents gene count, and the color of the dot represents
  the q value. (F, G) GSEA analysis shows the underlying signal pathway between the
  low (F) and high (G) ICD expression groups. The top 5 signaling pathways were shown
  on the graph.
