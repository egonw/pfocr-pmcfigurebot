caption: Effect of Z. morio hemolymph on the NLRP3 inflammasome and ATG5/ATG16L1-mediated
  autophagy signaling pathway in E. coli-induced mastitis. (A) Protein levels of NLRP3,
  ASC and Caspase-1 was measured using western blotting analysis. The right panel
  shows the protein quantification using ImageJ software (version 1.50). (B) Levels
  of IL-1β and IL-18 were measured by ELISA. (C) Protein levels of ATG5, ATG16L1,
  P62 and LC3A/B-II was measured using Western blotting analysis. The panel shows
  the protein quantification using ImageJ software (version 1.50). (D) Relative quantification
  and localization of LC3A/B-II (brown-yellow dots) expression by IHC. Black arrows
  indicate LC3A/B-II localized in the cytosol of MECs, black triangles indicate LC3A/B-II
  localized in the cytosol of MECs that exfoliated into the acinar lumen. XTRC beetle
  stands for Z. morio hemolymph-treatment. Data presented are means ± SEM (n = 8 per
  group). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
