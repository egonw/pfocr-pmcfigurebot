caption: 'Impact on the levels of metabolites in U-87MG. Metabolite levels obtained
  from 1H-NMR spectra of aqueous phase of U-87MG cell extracts (heatmap: (A)) are
  divided into several groups: essential amino acids (B), BCAA synthesis/degradation
  pathway (C), non/semiessential amino acids (D), fatty acid and phospholipid synthesis
  (E), nucleotides and derivatives (F), glycolysis and TCA cycle (G), glutathione
  (GSH) synthesis (H), one-carbon metabolism (I), and other metabolites that did not
  fit in the previous groups (J). Organic compounds obtained from 1H-NMR spectra of
  organic phase of U-87MG cell extracts (K): –CH=CH– (unsaturated FA: UFA), glycerol
  from triacylglycerol (Gly), phosphatidylcholine (PhCho), –CH=CH–CH2–CH=CH– (polyunsaturated
  FA: PUFA), fatty acids (FA), CH2 and CH3 from FA elongation, esterified cholesterol
  (ChoE), free cholesterol (ChoF), and total cholesterol (ChoT). All data are represented
  as mean ± SD. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, **** p < 0.0001.'
