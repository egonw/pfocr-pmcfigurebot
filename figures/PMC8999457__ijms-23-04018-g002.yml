caption: Neurotropic RNA virus evasion of IFN-β induction and responses in the CNS.
  Several RNA viruses can bypass the blood–brain barrier (BBB) through the circulatory
  system and enter the cells of the central nervous system (CNS). We also note that
  viral entry into the CNS may occur through other routes in addition to the circulatory
  vessels depicted within microglia; these viruses can block (red inhibitory arrows)
  components of the RIG-I signaling pathway, blocking IFN-β induction and subsequent
  JAK-STAT interferon signaling. Black arrows indicate subsequent steps within the
  signaling pathway or translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Created with
