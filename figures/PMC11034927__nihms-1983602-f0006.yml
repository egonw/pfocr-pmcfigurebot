figure_title: Abrogation of Nrg-ErbB-PI3K-PI5K-mTorc2 signaling promotes Mitf nuclear
  translocation
caption: (A) Diagram of activating (green) and inhibiting (red) phosphorylation sites
  (P) of the Mit/Tfe family. The kinases that regulate each of those phosphorylation
  sites and the pharmacological inhibitors used in primary culture to target each
  of these kinases are indicated.(B) Diagram of SC primary culture with inhibitors.(C–N′)
  Primary SC culture derived from dissociated sciatic nerves of P4 WT mice, stained
  for Mitf (green) and Hoechst (blue).(C–C′) Primary SCs were cultured with DMSO (control),
  (D-D′) trametinib (MEK), (E and E′) SCH772984 (ERK1/2), (F and F′) enzastaurin (PKC),
  (G and G′) BIO (GSK3), (H and H′) MK-2206 (AKT), (I and I′) Torin (mTorc1/2), (J
  and J′) YM201636 (Pikfyve), (K and K′) VPS34-IN1 (Vps34), (L and L′) canertinib
  (ErbB), (M and M′) hNrg1, and (N and N′) rapamycin (mTorc1). Scale bar, 30 μm.(O)
  Examples of Mitf subcellular localization (top) and quantification of Mitf enrichment
  in the cytoplasm (pink), uniformly distributed (purple) or enriched in the nucleus
  (blue). n = 3 independent experiments for each inhibitor, n > 100 cells per experiment.
  The data are represented as the mean + SEM.(P and Q) Models of Mitf cytoplasmic
  retention and translocation into the SC nucleus.(P) Axon-derived Nrg1 signaling
  to ErbB expressed by SCs activates a cascade of phosphoinositide kinases that control
  mTorc2. Under normal conditions, mTorc2 is predicted to prevent the translocation
  of Mitf into the nucleus.(Q) Abrogation of the Nrg-ErbB-PI3K-PI5K-mTOR signaling
  pathway results in Mitf protein transport from the cytosol to the nucleus, where
  it activates a gene program that modulates SC dedifferentiation, metabolism, and
  EMT.
