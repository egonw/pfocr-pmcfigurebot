caption: Organic Cation Transporters (OCTs) present in LECs of mouse and human and
  Metformin upregulated the expression of OCT1, OCT2 and OCT3 in mouse LECs of both
  sexes and human LECs. mLECs (A; 5 × 105/60 mm), primary mLECs (5 × 104/12-well plate)
  isolated from C57BL/6 male (B), or female mouse (C), Emb-hLECs (D–F; 4 × 104/12
  well plate) or SRA-hLECs (D–F; 5 × 105/60 mm) were cultured and treated or untreated
  with 1 mM of Metformin for 24 h as shown. Total RNA was isolated and subjected for
  RT-qPCR and Western analyses with specific probes to OCTs. OCT1, OCT2 and OCT3 transcripts
  were significantly increased in response to Metformin. The histograms represent
  the mean ± S.D. from four independent experiments. Untreated vs. Metformin-treated;
  * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.001.
