caption: MST2 impairs IL6‐induced STAT3 activation at high cell density. A‐F, Immunoblotting
  analyses were performed using indicated antibodies. Immunoprecipitation with anti‐STAT3
  or anti‐YAP1 antibody was performed. STAT3 transcription activity was measured.
  Data represent the mean and SD from three independent experiments. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01;
  ***p < 0.001; ns, not significant. A, DU145 and LNCaP cells at high (~80%) or low
  (~10%) density were treated with 50 ng/ml IL6 for 30 min. B, DU145 and LNCaP cells
  at high (~80%) density were treated with 5 μM XMU‐MP‐1 for 2 h, and then treated
  with 50 ng/ml IL6 for 30 min. C, DU145 cells with expression of MST2 shRNAs at high
  (~80%) density were treated with 50 ng/ml IL6 for 30 min. D, DU145 cells with expression
  of LATS1/2 shRNAs at high (~80%) density were treated with 50 ng/ml IL6 for 30 min.
  E, DU145 cells with expression of MST1 shRNA at high (~80%) density were treated
  with 50 ng/ml IL6 for 30 min. F, DU145 cells with expression of YAP1 and TAZ at
  high (~80%) density were treated with 50 ng/ml IL6 for 30 min
