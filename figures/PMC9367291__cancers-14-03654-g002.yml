caption: Effects of IL-36γ on the MEK/ERK and JNK/c-Jun signaling pathway in JB6 Cl41
  cells. (a–d) Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of IL-36γ for
  30 min (a,c) or 10 ng/mL IL-36γ for the indicated times (b,d). Proteins in the whole-cell
  lysates were analyzed by Western blotting. (e) Cells were transfected with mouse
  sgCtrl and sgIL-36R. After 48 h of transfection, cells were serum-starved for 24
  h prior to treatment with 10 ng/mL of IL-36γ. After 15 min, total protein was collected,
  and the levels of the indicated protein were determined by Western blotting using
  specific antibodies. (f,g) Cells were pre-treated with the indicated concentrations
  of PD98059 (f) and SP600125 (g) for 12 h and then treated with 10 ng/mL IL-36γ for
  15 min. Proteins in the whole-cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting. (a–g)
  Representative blots are shown from at least three independent experiments. 3.3.
