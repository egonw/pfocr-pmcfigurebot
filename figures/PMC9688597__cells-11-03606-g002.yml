caption: Interfering with LTB4R inhibited ccRCC cell cycle and promoted ccRCC cell
  apoptosis. (A,B) Knockdown of LTB4R promoted apoptosis in Caki1 and ACHN cells.
  (Câ€“F) After knockdown of LTB4R, the proportion of the G1/G0 phase in Caki1 and ACHN
  cells increased, while the proportion of the G2/M phase decreased, and the proportion
  of the S phase did not change significantly. (G) Western Blot Analysis showed that
  after knockdown of LTB4R, the apoptosis-related proteins, BAX and c-CASP3 (c-caspase-3)
  were increased and the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2 was decreased in Caki1 and ACHN
  cells. (H) Western Blot Analysis showed that the period-related proteins CCND1 (CyclinD1),
  CDK2, and CDK4 were all reduced after LTB4R knockdown. A 2-tailed t test was used
  (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, ns, not significant).
