caption: 'Effect of S100A9 blockade on p53 in the LV post-MI. mRNA expression levels
  of cellular tumor antigen P53 (P53) in the LV of unoperated control Ct, Sham, MI
  and MI + ABR groups quantified by real-time PCR using Tbp (TATA sequence binding
  protein) as internal control, at 3 (A) and 7 (B) days post-MI. Interactions of p53
  with DEPs implicated in leukocyte cell–cell adhesion, regulation of the muscle cell
  apoptotic process, regulation of the intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway, sarcomere
  organization and cardiac muscle hypertrophy GO biological processes (C). The proteins
  (identified by gene name) are represented as rectangle nodes. Data are presented
  as mean ± SD; * p < 0.05 vs. Ct; # p < 0.05 vs. Sham; ^^ p < 0.01 vs. MI; p values
  were calculated using Student’s t test.'
