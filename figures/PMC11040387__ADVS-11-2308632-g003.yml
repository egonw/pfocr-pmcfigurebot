caption: 'Schematic illustration of nanomaterials regulating endogenous oxidation
  substances. a) The release of OH‐CPT from the cleavage of TBSOCPT by fluoride ions
  activates NOX to upregulate intracellular H2O2 and amplify the iron‐induced Fenton
  reaction to achieve synergistic therapy. Reproduced with permission.[] Copyright
