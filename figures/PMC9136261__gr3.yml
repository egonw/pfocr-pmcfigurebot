caption: Metabolic variations of Y. lipolytica W29 grown on six carbon nutrients.
  (A) Central metabolism including glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate pathway,
  mitochondrial TCA cycle (blue shading) and fatty acid biosynthesis (green shading).
  (B) Significantly altered metabolic fluxes under six carbon nutrient conditions
  shown in mean values. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure
  legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
