caption: RBM8A expression is increased in breast cancer (BC) cells and tissues. (a)
  QRT-PCR was performed to detect the expression of RBM8A in BC tissues and paired
  normal tissues. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. normal tissues; (b) western blot was performed to
  measure the protein expression of RBM8A in MCF10A, MCF-7, MDA-MB-436, and MDA-MB-231
  cells. ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. MCF10A; (c) the expression of RBM8A in MCF10A,
  MCF-7, MDA-MB-436, and MDA-MB-231 cells was detected by qRT-PCR. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P
  < 0.01 vs. MCF10A; (d and e) the expression of RBM8A in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells
  was assessed by qRT-PCR; (f and g) the protein level of RBM8A in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
  cells was determined by western blotting. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. sh-NC. Each
  experiment was repeated three times.
