caption: 'STING promotes CRC tumor cell growth, migration, invasiveness, and drug
  sensitivity. (A) Detection of STING expression in CRC cell lines using western blotting;
  Quantitative analysis of STING expression in CRC cells. (B) Transfection efficiency
  of siRNA in CRC cells verified by fluorescent siRNA probe (10×, scale: 100 µm).
  (C) Verification of knockdown and overexpression efficiency using western blot.
  (D,E) 24 hours after transfection, the numbers of migrating and invasive cells after
  treatment with NC-siRNA = NC, STING-siRNA = STING-KD, VEC, STING-OE were determined
  and recorded using transwell assays [3–5 fields were taken for each group, and the
  results were analyzed quantitatively; Crystal Violet Staining of CRC cells (10×,
  scale: 100 µm)]. (F) CCK-8 assays were carried out to evaluate the proliferation
  ability of the cells (HCT116 and SW480 cells) at 24, 48, and 72 hours. (G) The concentration
  absorbance of each group was measured after 24, 48, and 72 hours using CCK-8 assays
  for the CTL group, STING-siRNA group, and 5-fluorouracil-treated cell group, and
  the results was then analyzed and calculated (5-fluorouracil concentration: 2.5
  µM). P<0.05 was considered statistically significant; *P<0.05, **P<0.01, and ***P<0.001.
  CRC, colorectal cancer; STING, stimulator of interferon genes; OE, overexpression;
  KD, knock down; VEC, vector; NC, Normal control; CTL, control.'
