caption: Effect of powdery mildew (PM) infection and medicarpin pretreatment on phytohormone
  and isoflavonoid levels in Medicago truncatula. (a, b) Changes in total salicyclic
  acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) levels in A17 and R108 leaves at early time points
  of PM infection. The x axes represent hours postinoculation (hpi) with Erysiphe
  pisi. Significant differences between infection time points in comparison to 0 hpi
  were computed using one‐way analysis of variance with Dunnett's multiple comparisons
  test and between genotypes by unpaired t test (*p < 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤ 0.001,
  ****p ≤ 0.0001). (c) Experimental outline. Mature R108 leaves were infiltrated with
  10 µM medicarpin or 0.2% dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) (mock). A subset of leaves from
  each group was sampled at 1 and 3 h after medicarpin treatment and the remaining
  were inoculated with E. pisi and sampled at 48 hpi. (d, e) Levels of medicarpin,
  total SA, JA, intermediates of the 5‐deoxyisoflavonoid branch, and their precursor
  liquiritigenin in R108 leaves 3 h (preinoculation) and 48 hpi (post‐PM inoculation)
  medicarpin‐ or mock‐treated leaves. Data represent the mean ± SEM of 10 biological
  replicates from three independent experiments. Significant differences between mock
  and medicarpin treatment and between time points were computed by unpaired t test
