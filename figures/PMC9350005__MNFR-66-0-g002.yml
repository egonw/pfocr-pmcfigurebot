caption: 'Impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection on human milk metabolite profile. A) Classification
  samples based on their metabolomic profile of HM from C: healthy controls, CV‐s:
  SARS‐CoV‐2 positive mothers with symptoms and CV‐a: SARS‐CoV‐2 positive asymptomatic
  mothers by PCA‐3D and B) orthogonal partial least squares‐discriminate analysis
  (OPLS‐DA) plot of differential metabolites. C) Summary chart of the interconnected
  metabolic pathways related to altered metabolites in human milk of SARS‐CoV‐2 positive
  mothers. p‐value is the p calculated from the enrichment analysis and the impact
  is the pathway impact value calculated from pathway topology analysis. D) Distinct
  metabolomic profiles according COVID‐19 and control groups. Heatmaps showing the
  differential metabolomic profile of HMB from COVID‐19 mothers against controls.
  E) COVID‐19 mothers with symptoms against controls and F) COVID‐19 mothers asymptomatic
  against controls (p < 0.05). C: HM from healthy controls, CV‐s: HM from SARS‐CoV‐2
  positive mothers with symptoms, and CV‐a: HM from SARS‐CoV‐2 positive asymptomatic
  mothers.'
