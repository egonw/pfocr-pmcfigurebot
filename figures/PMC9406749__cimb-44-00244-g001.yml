caption: The methodology process for the investigation is illustrated in a snapshot.
  A transcriptomic comparative analysis was performed between the datasets of OC.
  Initially, three datasets were exported for OC through the GEO open repository;
  then GEO2R was used to normalize the datasets. Three normalized datasets were compared
  with each other to find common DEGs. This comparison method showed a total of 166
  DEGs, which were used to further analysis including the PPI network, GO analysis,
  pathway analysis, module network, and hub genes. Finally, using the hub genes, drug
  compounds and TF-miRNA co-regulatory network were extracted.
