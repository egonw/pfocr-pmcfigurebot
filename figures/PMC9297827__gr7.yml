caption: Protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) analysis predicts ER stress in
  AT2 cells as a driver pathophysiology in COVID-19. a. Schematic summarizes the key
  steps in building a PPI network using as ‘seeds’ the genes in the sVIP, AT2 senescence
  and transition state arrest (DATP) signatures and connecting them using shortest
  paths prior to carrying out network analyses. b. The combined PPI network is shown
  on the left and the degree of connectivity is indicated. See also Supplemental Information
  5 for the complete list of nodes sorted by their degrees of connectivity. Schematics
  on the right summarize the results of CluGo analysis, which identifies cellular
  processes and key genes that may perpetuate lung fibrosis. c. Reactome pathway analysis
  of the PPI network lists the most significant pathways that are associated with
  the node list in the network in B. Red = senescence related processes; Green = DNA
  damage response pathways; Blue = Platelet activation and degranulation.
