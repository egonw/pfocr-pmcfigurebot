figure_title: CircLIFR can bind to miR-624-5P by serving as miRNA sponges
caption: 'A qRT-PCR assay to quantify the subcellular localization of circLIFR in
  Huh7 and SNU387 cells. B Fluorescence in situ hybridization shows circLIFR is mainly
  located in the cytoplasm. C RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay demonstrating that
  circLIFR can sponge miRNAs by using the antibody of Ago2. D Schematic illustration
  showing the potential target miRNAs of circLIFR, predicted by miRanda and starbase.
  E RNA pull-down assay shows the miRNAs enriched in Huh7 cells. F–H The luciferase
  activities of circLIFR-WT, circLIFR-MUT1, and circLIFR-MUT2 plasmid luciferase reporters
  after co-transfection with miR-624-5p mimics or mimic NC in HCC cells. Scale bar:
  10 μm. Data represent means ± SD of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05.'

  miR-624-5p and inactivating the GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway.
