figure_title: Pathway and Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) supports downregulation
  of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in samples treated with the romidepsin-mechlorethamine
  combination
caption: (a) KEGG pathway analysis using DAVID 6.8 on the top differentially expressed
  genes in cell lines treated with the combination of romidepsin and mechlorethamine
  (p<0.01, log2fold-change>1.5 or <âˆ’1.5). Pathways with p<0.05 are shown. (b) Heatmap
  of the normalized expression of all significantly de-regulated genes in cell lines
  treated with Mechlorethamine alone, Romidepsin alone or both in combination compared
  to vehicle control. Genes were clustered by the complete linkage agglomerative hierarchical
  clustering method on the Euclidean distances. Cutoffs used to define significance
  in A, B and D were; padj < 0.01, logFC > 1.2. (c) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis revealed
  significant enrichment of the Pathway Interaction Database IL2-STAT5 Pathway gene
  signature (FWER p-Value < 0.001, NES 2.53 in vehicle-combination). Enrichment plot
  is presented in the left panel and normalized expression of the genes comprised
  by the leading edge of the signature are plotted in the heatmap in the right panel.
