caption: Tregs promote chemoresistance through the IL-10/STAT3/BCL2 signaling pathway.
  (A) Western blotting assay of p-STAT3 and STAT3 expression in SGC7901 and BGC823
  cells treated with PBS (IgG), 5-Fu (50 μg/mL), Treg supernatant, or a combination
  of 5-Fu and Treg supernatant. (B) Western blotting assay of p-STAT3 and STAT3 expression
  in SGC7901 and BGC823 cells treated with PBS (IgG), 5-Fu, IL-10, or a combination
  of 5-Fu and IL-10. (C) Western blotting assay of BCL2 expression in SGC7901 and
  BGC823 cells treated with PBS (IgG), 5-Fu, Treg supernatant, or a combination of
  5-Fu and Treg supernatant. (D) Western blotting assay of BCL2 expression in SGC7901
  and BGC823 cells treated with PBS (IgG), 5-Fu, IL-10, or a combination of 5-Fu and
  IL-10. (E) Proliferation of SGC7901-NC, SGC7901-STAT3 KO1, and SGC7901-STAT3 KO2
  cells treated with PBS, 5-Fu, Treg supernatant, or a combination of 5-Fu and Treg
  supernatant. (F) Proliferation of BGC823-NC, BGC823-STAT3 KO1, and BGC823-STAT3
  KO2 cells treated with PBS, 5-Fu, Treg supernatant, or a combination of 5-Fu and
  Treg supernatant. (G) Proliferation of SGC7901-NC, SGC7901-BCL2 KO1, and SGC7901-BCL2
  KO2 cells treated with PBS, 5-Fu, Treg supernatant, or a combination of 5-Fu and
  Treg supernatant. (H) Proliferation of BGC823-NC, BGC823-BCL2 KO1, and BGC823-BCL2
  KO2 cells treated with PBS, 5-Fu, Treg supernatant, or a combination of 5-Fu. Data
  are presented as the means ± SD of three independent experiments. PBS, phosphate-buffered
  saline. For better viewing of the data, please see the online version.
