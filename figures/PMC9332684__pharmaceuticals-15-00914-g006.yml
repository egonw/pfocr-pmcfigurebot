caption: 'Effect of montelukast on the placenta in a pre-eclampsia model in rats.
  Photomicrographs of the control (A) and the Mont (B) groups showing full-term rat
  placenta at the level of labyrinth displaying normal interramal membrane and its
  constituents (double-headed arrow) with normal fetal capillaries (f) and normal
  maternal sinus (M). Notice the chorionic projection with their layers (green arrow)
  and inner fetal blood capillary with normal RBCs (star). (C) The L-NAME group showing
  distorted chorionic projection (star). Notice the dilated, congested maternal (M)
  vessels and fetal capillaries (f) and inflammatory cell infiltration (circle). (D)
  The Mont + L-NAME group showing amelioration of all previously mentioned pathological
  changes. Notice the apparent normal chorionic villi (star), maternal (M) vessels,
  and fetal capillaries (f). H&E × 400. (E1–E3) The histopathological changes in renal
  tissue in all groups. The data are mean ± SEM (8 rats/group). (a) Significant (p
  < 0.05) difference from the control group. (b) Significant (p < 0.05) difference
  from the Mont group. (c) Significant (p < 0.05) difference from the L-NAME group.
  [Mont: montelukast; L-NAME: L-NG-Nitro arginine methyl ester]. H&E × 400, scale
