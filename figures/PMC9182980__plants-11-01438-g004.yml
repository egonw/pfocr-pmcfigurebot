caption: 'Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to the reactive oxygen species
  metabolic pathway and the chlorophyll metabolic pathway. The gene-related information
  for the heat map analysis is included in : (a) heat map analysis of the DEGs (between
  the 2-3 and control plants) that encode antioxidant enzymes; (b) heat map analysis
  of the DEGs (between the 2-3 and control plants) that encode chlorophyll synthase
  and chlorophyll-metabolizing enzymes.'
