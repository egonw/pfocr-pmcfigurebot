caption: ADP-ribosylation is modified in the drug-resistant cancer stem cells LN-Flu.
  (A) Box and whisker plot of metabolites involved in the pathway. (B) Levels of ADP-ribosyl
  transferase 1 (PARP-1) and PAR-glycohydrolase (PARG1-3) determined by Western blot.
  Densitometric analysis of the western blot bands from three independent experiments
  is shown on the right. Results are the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments.
  *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 significant difference between LNCaP and LN-Flu cells by
  two-way ANOVA and Sidak’s multiple comparisons test. (C) ADP-ribosylation reaction
  showing the metabolites and enzymes we have found up (red arrow up) or down (red
  arrow down) in LN-Flu cells compared to LNCaP cells.
