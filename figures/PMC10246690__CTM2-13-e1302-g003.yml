caption: 'The validation of the calcium‐related signalling pathway and the joint analysis
  on the molecular mechanism in human iPSC‐CMs with 0.55 mg/mL Shenxianshengmai (SXSM).
  (A and B) Effects of different concentrations of KN93, inhibitor of CaM/CaMKII,
  on beat rate (BR)/Amp after pre‐treatment with 0.55 mg/mL SXSM in impedance mode.
  (A) BR; (B) Amp. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001 compared to
  the values of horizontal coordinate ‘SXSM’ (one‐way ANOVA). (C and D) Effects of
  different concentrations of autocamtide‐2‐related inhibitory peptide (AIP), inhibitor
  of CaMKII, on BR/Amp after pre‐treatment with 0.55 mg/mL SXSM in impedance mode.
  (C) BR; (D) Amp. (E) Western blotting analysis. Western blotting analysis of down‐regulated
  protein levels of pCaMK in human iPSC‐CMs in response to 0.55 mg/mL SXSM 1 h. Representative
  results from three independent experiments. (F and G) Effects of different concentrations
  of CGP‐37157, inhibitor of NCLX, on the BR/Amp after pre‐treatment with 0.55 mg/mL
  SXSM in impedance mode. (F) BR; (G) Amp. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 comparison
  between groups. &p < 0.05, &&p < 0.01, &&&p < 0.001, compared to the point with
  the horizontal coordinate ‘SXSM .55 mg/mL’ in SXSM 0.55 mg/mL + CGP doses group
  (red) (one‐way ANOVA). (A–D, F and G) Each treatment was spaced 1 h apart. (H) Proposed
  Ca2+/CaM signalling pathway involved in the effects of 0.55 mg/mL SXSM 1 h on human
  iPSC‐CMs. (I) Summary of the joint analysis of the mechanisms. All data are presented
  as the mean ± SE. Source: Panels (H) and (I) were created with BioRender.com.'
