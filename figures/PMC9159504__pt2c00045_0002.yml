caption: Exertion of anti-cancer activity of emetine through the modulation of p38
  MAPK and ERK signaling pathways. Activation of the p38 MAPK pathway can lead to
  pathogenic conditions such as disruption of cardiac fibroblast function, induction
  of pro-inflammation, vasoconstriction, pro-atrophy, and pro-fibrosis situations
  that eventually lead to cellular heart damage.
