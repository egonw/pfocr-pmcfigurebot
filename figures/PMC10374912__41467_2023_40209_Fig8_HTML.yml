figure_title: Model for transcriptional control of AOX2 in C. albicans
caption: Under growth conditions requiring respiration, inhibition of the classical
  ETC triggers cooperative binding of the Rtg1/Rtg3 and the Cwt1/Zcf11 transactivator
  complexes to the CARbox. Highly specific ETC inhibitors (e.g., AA and rotenone)
  activate AOX2 primarily through this pathway. More promiscuous inhibitors such as
  cyanide, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen or sulfur species can activate AOX2 expression
  through a second Zcf2-meditated pathway. This pathway requires binding of Zcf2 to
  the AOX2 promoter but is less dependent on cellular metabolic state. Yellow dots
  indicate potential changes in the post-translational modification of Cwt1 and Zcf2
  under activating conditions. This image was created with BioRender.com.
