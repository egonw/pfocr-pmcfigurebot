caption: The effect of PCBP1 deficiency on the CSFV life cycle and IFN pathway(A)
  Cells were infected with CSFV at a MOI of 10 at 4°C for 1 h and then shifted to
  37°C for 0 (binding), 1 (entry), and 24 h (replication). Samples were collected
  and lysed to determine the number of CSFV RNA units using RT‒qPCR.(B) The relative
  mRNA fold change of IFN pathway genes and downstream effectors in PCBP1 KO cells.(C)
  The relative mRNA fold change in IFN pathway genes and downstream effectors in CSFV-infected
  PCBP1 KO cells compared with cells infected with PEDV-infected at 48 hpi.(D) The
  predicted interactors of PCBP1. The thickness of the gray line represents combined
  scores.(E) The relative mRNA fold change of predicted genes in PCBP1 KO cells.(F)
  The relative mRNA fold change in predicted genes in CSFV-infected PCBP1 KO cells
  compared with cells infected with PEDV at 48 hpi. Bars are the mean ± SEM, and the
  data were analyzed using Student’s t-test using GraphPad Prism 8.0. ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01;
  ∗∗∗p < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001; ns, no significance; n = 3.
