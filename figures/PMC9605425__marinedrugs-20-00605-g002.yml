caption: (A–C) qPCR-measured relative expression of (A) CCL2, (B) ICAM1 and (C) SELE
  genes in HUVECs under indicated treatments for 6 h; in each case, expression was
  relativized to the ACTB gene and normalized to the LPS positive control; means and
  standard deviations of three independent replicates are represented and statistical
  analyses were performed through t-tests; * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001.
