figure_title: The loading values of all predictive metabolites of the orthogonal partial
  least squares discriminant analysis model
caption: The differential metabolites between producers and non-producers were determined
  by a Mann Whitney test (adjusted p-values with Benjamini-Hochberg method) with a
  level of significance of 0.05 (bars with black outline) and used as input for a
  metabolic pathway enrichment with FELLA algorithm. The colors indicate the mapped
  metabolite pathway for each metabolite.
