caption: 'Resveratrol (RSV) stimulates the NGFR downstream pathway AMPK-mTOR. (A)
  Protein expression of p-AMPK, AMPK, p-mTOR, mTOR, and ACTB as determined by Western
  blot in cells with or without NGFR knockdown; (B) Protein expression of p-AMPK,
  AMPK, p-mTOR, mTOR, and ACTB as determined by Western blot in cells with or without
  NGFR knockdown, in the presence or absence of 80 μM RSV for 48 h. The data are presented
  as the mean ± SD of triplicate tests. ** p < 0.01 compared with the control group.
  ## p < 0.01 compared with siNGFR group.'
