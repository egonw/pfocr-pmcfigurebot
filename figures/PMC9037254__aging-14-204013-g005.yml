caption: Effects of Nrf2 knockdown on the regulation of the GC invasion capacity under
  a hypoxic condition. The invasion capacity was suppressed in GC cells transfected
  with siNrf2-1498 under hypoxic conditions. (A) MKN28 cells; (B) BGC823 cells; (C)
  SGC7901 cells; (D) The graph shows the quantified data of the assay. (**P<0.001).
