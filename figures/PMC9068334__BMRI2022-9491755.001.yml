caption: Baicalin improved the survival of Aβ1-42-treated SH-SY5Y cells. (a) Cell
  viability of SH-SY5Y cells treated with 10 μM Aβ1-42 for different times. (b) Cell
  viability of SH-SY5Y cells treated with different concentrations of baicalin. (c)
  Cell viability of Aβ1-42-treated SH-SY5Y cells treated with different concentrations
  of baicalin. (d) LDH of Aβ1-42-treated SH-SY5Y cells treated with different concentrations
  of baicalin. The levels of cell viability and LDH are presented as the mean ± SD.
  N = 6, ∗ represents P < 0.05, and ∗∗ represents P < 0.01.
