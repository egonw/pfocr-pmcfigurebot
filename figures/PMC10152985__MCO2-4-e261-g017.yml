caption: The protein ubiquitination pathway. The ubiquitin (Ub) moiety is activated
  by E1 through the cysteine (Cys) residue of E1. Ub at E1 is transferred to the Cys
  residue of E2. Ub conjugated with E2 is transferred to the lysine residue of a substrate
  protein by E3. Ubiquitinated proteins with ubiquitination are subjected to 26S proteasome‚Äêdependent
  degradation or execute other functions and activities. Deubiquitination is the opposite
  mechanism of ubiquitination mediated by DUBs. The process includes reversing ubiquitin
  conjugation and recycling ubiquitin molecules through the UPS. Based on the enzymatic
  cleavage mechanism, the DUB family is divided into two subfamilies. The cysteine
  protease family consists of USP, UCH, OTH, MJD, MINDY, MCPIP, and ZUFSP. Metalloprotease
  family includes JAMM.
