caption: Antitumor efficacy of solamargine (SM) combined with sorafenib (SF) in vivo.
  (A and B) Mice (n = 8/group) were divided to four groups (Con [saline], SF [30 mg/kg],
  SM [6 mg/kg], and SM plus SF). The tumor growth was monitored by injecting luciferin
  followed by measuring bioluminescence signals at the initial and end of the experiments.
  (C and D) The xenografts were harvested on Day 25, the tumor weight and tumor volume
  were measured. (E and H) The xenograft tumors were isolated and processed for detecting
  MUC1, HOTTIP, TUG1, and miR‐4726‐5p by using IHC, Western blot, and real‐time quantitative
  PCR analysis, respectively. (I) The diagram showed that SM inhibits the cell growth
  of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through inactivation of lncRNA HOTTIP and TUG1,
  followed by increasing the expression of miR‐4726‐5p, this ultimately suppresses
  the promoter activity and protein expression of MUC1. This complex interaction and
  feedback regulatory axis contribute to the synergy inhibition effect of combination
  of SM and SF in HCC. *Significant difference as compared to the untreated control
  group (p < 0.05). **Significant difference from the SM or SF alone (p < 0.05) [Color
