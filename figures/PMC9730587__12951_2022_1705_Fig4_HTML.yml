caption: SPc induces measurable changes in larval gene expression. A Analysis of differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) after feeding fly larvae with SPc nanoparticles shown as
  a volcano plot. Upregulated genes are represented by red dots and downregulated
  genes by green dots. B Analysis of biological processes affected by SPc. The X-axis
  is the number of DEGs, and the terms of biological processes are listed on the right
  side of each bar. C Heatmaps of the Toll signaling pathway, Hippo signaling pathway
  and stress response pathway. Highly expressed transcripts are labeled as red, while
  blue represents transcripts with low expression levels. Gene symbols are listed
  on the right side

  stage adversely impairs life history traits in Drosophila melanogaster.
