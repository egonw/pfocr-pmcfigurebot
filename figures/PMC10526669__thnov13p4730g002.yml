caption: Inhibition of the IL-6-STAT3 pathway blocks IL-6-induced Trx-1 nuclear translocation,
  migration and invasion. (A) Cytoplasmic and nuclear levels of pSTAT3, STAT3 and
  Trx-1 determined by Western blotting in HT-29 and SW480 cells transfected with 50
  μM STAT3-siRNA or NC siRNA for 48 h and then treated with IL-6 (20 ng/mL) for 2
  h. (B) Cytoplasmic and nuclear levels of pSTAT3, STAT3 and Trx-1 determined by Western
  blotting in HT-29 and SW480 cells exposed to S3I-201 for 1 h and then treated with
  IL-6 for 2 h. (C) Trx-1 localization by immunostaining in HT-29 and SW480 cells
  transfected with 50 μM STAT3-siRNA or negative control (NC) for 48 h, or treated
  with S3I-201 for 1 h, followed by IL-6 treatment for 2 h. Cells were stained with
  anti-Trx-1 and DAPI. Scale bar, 20 μm. (D) Effect of STAT3 knockdown on the migration
  and invasion ability of CRC cells. SW480 cells were transfected with 50 μM STAT3-siRNA
  or NC for 48 h, and a Transwell assay performed in the presence of IL-6 (20 ng/mL)
  for 48 h. (E) Effect of Trx-1 inhibition on the migration and invasion ability of
  CRC cells. HT-29 and SW480 cells were exposed to S3I-201 for 1 h, and then a Transwell
  assay performed in the presence of IL-6 (20 ng/mL) for 48 h. The histogram gives
  the number of migrating and invading cells. **P < 0.01.
