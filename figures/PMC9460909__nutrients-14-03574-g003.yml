caption: Effects of the WES diet on gene expression of liver and skeletal muscle at
  slaughter. Only CTR− and WES− animals were included in this analysis. (A) Volcano
  plot representing the RNAseq results in liver in WES− sows compared to CTR− sows.
  Orange dots indicate the differentially abundant transcripts (DATs) that are significantly
  up-regulated (cut-off of p < 0.05 and −1.5 > fold change > +1.5), while the blue
  dots represent the down-regulated DATs (cut-off of p < 0.05 and −1.5 > fold change
  > +1.5). (B) Heatmap representing the z-score of biological functions significantly
  affected by WES diet (calculation performed in IPA) in the liver. Blue indicates
  a negative z-score (inhibition) and orange a positive z-score (activation). (C)
  Regulatory effect of IGF-1 on the hepatic necrosis pathway. (D) Volcano plot representing
  the RNAseq results in skeletal muscle. Orange dots indicate the up-regulated DATs
  (cut-off of p < 0.05 and −1.5 > fold change > +1.5), while the blue dots represent
  the down-regulated DATs (cut-off of p < 0.05 and −1.5 > fold change > +1.5). (E)
  Heatmap representing the z-score of biological functions significantly affected
  by WES diet (calculation performed in IPA) in muscle. (F) Predicted activation of
  upstream regulators in skeletal muscle of WES− sows.
