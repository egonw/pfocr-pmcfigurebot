caption: TCA cycle pathway enriched by both genes and metabolites in group IN (a)
  and RE (b). Based on the pathway model in integrated analysis between transcriptome
  and metabolome of Aeromonas veronii-yellow catfish, TCA cycle pathway was enriched
  by both genes and metabolites at invaded stage and recovering stage. For convenience,
  “IN”, and “RE” indicate the A. veronii-infected groups at invaded stage and recovering
  stage, respectively.

  and Recovering Stage.
