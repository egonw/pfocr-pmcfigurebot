caption: Effect of pinostrobin on the phosphorylation of CREB, GSK-3β, and β-catenin
  in B16F10 cells. Cells were treated with pinostrobin at various concentrations for
  24 h. (a) p-CREB, p-GSK-3β, and β-catenin, were analyzed by Western blotting. (b–d)
  Blots were quantified using ImageJ software. Protein levels were normalized to the
  corresponding loading controls. The untreated cells were regarded as 100%. Values
  are expressed represent as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. *** p
  < 0.001 ** p < 0.01, and * p < 0.05 compared with control group.
