caption: The gut microbiota composition and inferred functional content of gut microbiota
  between control (CON) and cotrimoxazole (SXT) C57BL/6 mice. (A) ANCOM-BC log fold
  change showing differentially abundant taxonomic phylum in the gut microbiota of
  SXT (n = 6) versus CON (n = 6) C57BL/6 mice; (B) ANCOM-BC log fold change showing
  differentially abundant taxonomic genus in the gut microbiota of SXT (n = 6) versus
  CON (n = 6) C57BL/6 mice; (C) LEfSe LDA scores showing significant pathway differences
  between CON (n = 6) and SXT (n = 6) C57BL/6 mice of PICRUSt predicted the relative
  MetaCyc pathways abundances. Significant differences between groups were corrected
  with Benjamini–Hochberg False Discovery Rate p FDR < 0.05.
