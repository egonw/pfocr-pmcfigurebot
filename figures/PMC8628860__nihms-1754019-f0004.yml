figure_title: A subpopulation with metastatic, stem-like phenotype recurs broadly
  across SCLC tumors
caption: (A) Boxplot of subtype uncertainty of each SCLC cell stratfied by cluster
  (Y-axis; measured as entropy of subtype probabilities per cell within each cluster;
  error bars span 25th to 75th percentile), ordered by recurrence across patients
  (X-axis; measured as Shannon entropy of patients per cluster; ).(B) Stacked barplot
  of sample fraction per cluster, ordered by recurrence across patients, as in (A).(C)
  UMAP of SCLC cells with recurrent cluster 22 colored in black.(D) Proportion of
  samples comprising the recurrent cluster (9 of 21 profiled tumors harboring >3%
  of the cluster). The number of cells per sample are indicated in parentheses for
  samples with the greatest representation of the recurrent cluster. Outer rings indicate
  the major intratumoral subtype (outer), tissue site (middle), and treatment history
  (inner).(E) Gene programs significantly enriched in cluster 22. Barplot of NES from
  GSEA for significantly enriched pathway (FDR < 0.05 and NES > 1; ).(F) Genes ordered
  from most to least recurrently overexpressed along the X-axis, with recurrence score
  plotted on the Y-axis. The recurrence score is calculated as follows. Within each
  sample, DEGs were assessed between the recurrent cluster vs the rest of the tumor.
  The adjusted p-values for differential expression within each tumor are combined
  using Edgington’s method. The recurrence score is the −log of the combined p-value
  (; ).(G) Violin plot with PLCG2 expression among individual cancer cells in our
  SCLC samples, grouped by tissue site (Bonferroni-adjusted Mann-Whitney test). Expression
  is plotted as log2(X+1) where X is the normalized count, imputed using MAGIC (k=30,
  t=3).See also  and .
