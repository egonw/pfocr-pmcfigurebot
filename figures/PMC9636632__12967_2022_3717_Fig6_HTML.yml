caption: GSVA analysis of KEGG pathways for ANT trend metabolites and metabolic pathways
  altered by ANT in the kidney and serum. The enrichment score for nine KEGG pathways
  by GSVA analysis in the kidney (A) and serum (C) among the CT, DKD, and ANT three
  groups. The red and blue nodes represent enrichment score of KEGG pathways in each
  sample for three groups, respectively. The gray and purple nodes represent P value
  of KEGG pathways (moderated t-test, P < 0.05). The differentially activated KEGG
  pathways between the DKD vs. CT and ANT vs. DKD groups in the kidney (B) and serum
  (D). The blue and orange bands represent the activated KEGG pathways of the DKD
  vs. CT and ANT vs. DKD groups, respectively, and the gray bands represent the nonactivated
  KEGG pathways. (E) The diagram of a part of the taurine and hypotaurine metabolism
  pathway. The expression of taurine, 5-L-glutamyl-taurine, and acetyl-CoA is shown
  in (E). The enzymatic expression of Ado, Cdo1, Fmo5, and Ggt1 is shown in (E). Other
  metabolites, including hypotaurine, cysteamine, L-cysteine, and 3-sulfino-L-alanine,
  were not identified in the current study. (F) The diagram of a part of the tryptophan
  and tyrosine metabolism pathway. The expression of L-tryptophan, L-kynurenine, 5-methoxyindoleacetate,
  indoleacetaldehyde, maleic acid, fumaric acid, and indole-5,6-quinone is shown in
  (F). The expression of Aldh1a7, Acat1, Cat, Hgd, Comt, and Fah is shown in (F).
  Other metabolites, including 3-hydroxyanthranilate, cinnavalininate, Acetyl-CoA,
  tyrosine, L-DOPA, L-metanephrine, and 4-maleylacetoacetate, were not identified
  in the current study
