caption: CASP3 mRNA and proteins in kidney tissue. (a) CASP3 mRNA levels. Values for
  mRNA levels are expressed as fold change relative to the wild‐type (WT) control
  group. Each value represents the mean ± SEM of triplicate combinations from 4 mice
  per group. Data were analyzed by two‐way ANOVA. a–c means values with different
  letters are significantly different. (b) Representative immunoblots of the CASP3
  proteins. The protein bands represent samples from individual kidneys. The relative
  optic densities (ODs) were calculated by normalizing the ODs of CASP3 to the OD
  for β‐tubulin in the same sample. Data are means±SEM from 3 mice per group. (c)
  Immunohistochemical staining for CASP3 in kidney tubules. (d) Immunostaining staining
  for CASP3 in renal corpuscles. OD data were quantified (n = 3 mice/group)and analyzed
  by two‐way ANOVA for 10 non‐overlapping fields for tubular and 10 non‐overlapping
  fields of renal corpuscle sections from each kidney (imaged at 60× magnification).
  a–d means values with different letters are significantly different (p < 0.01).
  (e) Immunolocalization of CASP3 proteins (red) in kidney tubules. Meprin β (green)
  in wild‐type (WT) and villin (green) in βKO were used as PT markers and DAPI (green)
  was used to stain the nuclei. There was a significant increase in CASP3 mRNA and
  proteins in both genotypes.
