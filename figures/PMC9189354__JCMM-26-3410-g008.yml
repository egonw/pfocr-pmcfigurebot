caption: Knockdown of MIF and SLC3A2 inhibited MIF and SLC3A2 expression in SW480
  and SW620 cells. SW480 and SW620 cells were transfected with control shRNA (shCon
  group), shMIF (shMIF group), shSLC3A2 (shSLC3A2 group) or co‐transfected with shMIF
  plus shSLC3A2 (shMIF+shSLC3A2 group), respectively. (A) MIF mRNA expression in SW480
  and SW620 cells in the control, shMIF and shCon groups. (B) SLC3A2 mRNA expression
  in SW480 and SW620 cells in the control, shSLC3A2 and shCon groups. (C) MIF protein
  expression in SW480 and SW620 cells in the control, shMIF and shCon groups. (D)
  SLC3A2 protein expression in SW480 and SW620 cells in the control, shSLC3A2 and
  shCon groups. (E) Western blotting was performed to confirm the levels of MIF and
  SLC3A2 protein expression in SW480 and SW620 cells. ‘*’ means p < 0.05 when compared
  with the control group; ‘#’ means p < 0.05 when compared with the shCon group. GAPDH
  served as an invariant internal control for calculating fold changes in protein
  expression
