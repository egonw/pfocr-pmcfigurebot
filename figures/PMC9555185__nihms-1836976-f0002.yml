figure_title: Applications of isotope tracers in metabolic research
caption: (a). Isotope tracers serve as reliable internal standards for quantifying
  metabolite abundance. Signal responses for tracers and metabolites of interest scale
  proportionally during sample preparation and acquisition. Additionally, different
  sample matrices affect mass spectrometric responses for isotope tracers and analytes
  to the same extent. By dividing the signal of a targeted analyte to that of its
  isotopic internal standard, true biological responses from mass spectrometry can
  be obtained. (b). Isotope tracing reveals the relative contribution of a substrate
  into target metabolites. (c). Tracers indicate pathway activities along different
  metabolic routes. By quantifying the labeling percentage of isotopomers characteristic
  of a unique pathway, relative fluxes can be compared. (d). Metabolic flux analysis
  integrates isotope tracing data that include mass isotopomer distribution (MID)
  and extracellular flux data from kinetic concentration measurements []. This advanced
  analysis of isotope tracing data yields comprehensive quantitation of fluxes for
  all metabolic pathways of interest.
