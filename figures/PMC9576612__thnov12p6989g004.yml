caption: CHI3L1 binds to ACTN4 and NFKB1, and promote the activation of NF-κB pathway.
  (A) Schematic of the procedure used to detect biotin-hCHI3L1-binding proteins using
  HuProt 20K human proteome microarrays. (B) ACTN1, 4, NFKB1, 2, and NFKBIB were identified
  as CHI3L1-binding proteins in the proteome microarrays. (C) The IF analysis of the
  expression levels of CHI3L1 and NF-κB p65 subunit in peritumor and intratumor regions;
  Scale bars represent 100 µm. (D) Western blot analysis of the expression levels
  of CHI3L1 in U118MG and U251MG cells after treated with TNFɑ (200 ng/mL) for 0-96
  h. (E) Chi3l1+/+ and Chi3l1-/- BMDMs were treated with TNFɑ (50 and 200 ng/mL),
  and phosphorylation of p65 were assessed via western blot. (F-G) U87MG and A172
  cells transfected with shCtrl and shCHI3L1 were treated with TNFɑ, and the phosphorylation
  of p65 were detected using western blot. (H-I) Cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins
  were isolated from BMDMs and U87MG after treated with TNFɑ (50 ng/mL) and applied
  to western blot to detect the expression of p65 and ACTN4. (J) Lysates from U87MG
  and A172 cells were immunoprecipitated with IgG or anti-CHI3L1 antibody, and then
  immunoblotted as indicated. (K) Cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were isolated from
  U87MG cells. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with IgG or anti-CHI3L1 antibody,
  and then immunoblotted as indicated. (L-N) Co-localization of CHI3L1 and ACTN4,
  NFKB1, or p65 in U87MG or A172 cells observed by confocal microscope. (O) CHI3L1
  and ACTN4 enhance NF-kB activation by using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. (P)
  Dox-inducible CHI3L1 expression enhanced enhanced NF-kB activation by TNFα in U251
  cells. (Q) Pearson correlations between CHI3L1 expression and ACTN4, NFKB1, NFKB2,
  RelA (p65), and NFKBIB in TCGA and CGGA glioma cohorts.
