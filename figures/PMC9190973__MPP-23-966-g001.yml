caption: Evaluation of powdery mildew (PM) growth after exogenous foliar application
  of isoflavonoids in R108. (a) Structure of isoflavonoids. (b) Relative expression
  of Ep18S rRNA in mock and 10 µM isoflavonoid‐treated leaves at 48 h postinoculation
  (hpi) with Erysiphe pisi. Data represent the mean ± SEM of eight biological replicates
  from two or three independent experiments. (c) Relative expression of Ep18S rRNA
  in mock and medicarpin‐treated leaves at 48 hpi. Data represent the mean ± SEM of
  five biological replicates from two independent experiments. Significant differences
  in (b) and (c) were computed using one‐way analysis of variance with Dunnett's multiple
  comparisons test (*p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤ 0.001, ****p ≤ 0.0001) (d) Representative
  images showing E. pisi growth on mock and 10 µM medicarpin‐treated leaves at 48 hpi.
  Scale bar, 50 µm. c, conidium; a, appressorium (e) The mean percentage (± SEM) of
  E. pisi conidia that reached different infection stages on mock and 10 µM medicarpin‐treated
  leaves at 48 hpi assessed from c.2000 conidia on a total of eight leaflets from
  three independent experiments. Significant differences were computed using multiple
  unpaired t test (**p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤ 0.001)
