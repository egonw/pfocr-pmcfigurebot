caption: 'Immunolocalization of MST1, LATS1, YAP1 and TEAD1 in the female yak’s mammary
  gland tissues at different developmental stages. Immunolocalization of MST1 (A),
  LATS1 (B), YAP1 (C), and TEAD1 (D) proteins in mammary gland tissues of female yaks
  during GP (A1–D1), LP (A2–D2), and DP (A3–D3). MST1 (A1), LATS1 (B1), YAP1 (C1),
  and TEAD1 (D1) appeared in the alveolar clusters (AL) and ductal system (DU) during
  GP. During lactation, alveolar and ductal epithelial cells were positive. MST1 (A2)
  and LATS1 (B2) were only positive in the cytoplasm, whereas YAP1 (C2) and TEAD1
  (D2) were expressed in the nucleus and cytoplasm. During the dry period, the target
  proteins (A3,B3,C3,D3) was mainly expressed in the ductal system and scattered in
  the mammary stroma. Negative control (E): mammary gland tissue sections were incubated
  with an equivalent non-immune IgG agent instead of a rabbit polyclonal antibody
  to MST1, LATS1, YAP1, and TEAD1 (E1–E3).'
