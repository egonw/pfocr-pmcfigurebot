caption: 'PUR-inhibited downregulated the expression of SMO, Gli1, and Shh induced
  by RES in HeLa cells. Cells were treated with DMSO or RES or PUR or RES and PUR
  for 24 h; the expressions of Gli1, SMO, and Shh were analyzed by qPCR (a) and western
  blotting (b and c) in the HeLa cells. All date was from 3 independent experiments
  (∗p < 0.05, Tukey test). Control (Ctrl): HeLa cells were treated with DMSO; RES:
  HeLa cells were treated with RES; PUR: HeLa cells were treated with PUR; RES + PUR:
  HeLa cells were cotreated with RES and PUR.'
