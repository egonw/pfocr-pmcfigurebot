caption: miR-205-5p is highly expressed in lung cancer and promotes cell proliferation.
  The expression of miR-205-5p in cells was detected by (A-C) reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR, (D) CCK8, (E) colony formation assays and (F and G) flow cytometry. Data are
  represented as the mean Â± SD of three experiments; *P<0.05 vs. BEAS-2B, control,
  NC mimic or NC inhibitor. miR, microRNA; CCK8, Cell Counting Kit-8; NC, negative
  control.
article_title: Icariin inhibits the malignant progression of lung cancer by affecting
  the PI3K/Akt pathway through the miR-205-5p/PTEN axis.
