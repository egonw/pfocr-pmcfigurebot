caption: ANLN expression was positively correlated with IGF2BP1 expression and MAPK
  pathways in PCa cells. A. Heatmap illustrating the differentially expressed genes
  (DEGs) in DU145 cells between shNC group and ANLN knockdown group. B. Volcano map
  showing the DEGs in DU145 cells between shNC group and shANLN group. C. KEGG pathway
  analysis of differently expressed genes based on ANLN-knockdown DU145 cell. D, E.
  Western blotting analysis of IGF2BP1 and MAPK associated proteins expression in
  PC-3 and DU145 cells. F, G. Cell mobility was assessed by CCK-8 assays in cells
  expressing the different constructs. ****P < 0.0001. H-J. Representative images
  and quantification of total colonies formed in PC-3 and DU145 cells expressing different
  vectors. ns P â‰¥ 0.05, ****P < 0.0001.
