caption: Effects of different apigenin concentrations on NIH‐3 T3 cells. (A) CCK‐8
  analysis of the viability of NIH‐3 T3 cells. (B–F) qRT‐PCR was used to detect the
  expression of Actα2, Col1α1, Col1α2, Fn and Col4α1 in NIH‐3 T3 cells treated with
  different apigenin concentrations for 24 h. (G) Western blotting was used to detect
  the expression of α‐SMA in NIH‐3 T3 cells treated with different concentrations
  of apigenin for 48 h. (H) Quantification of the expression of α‐SMA. (* means p < 0.05;
  ** means p < 0.01; *** means p < 0.001; **** means p < 0.0001, p values were calculated
  with one‐way anova, followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. n = 3)
