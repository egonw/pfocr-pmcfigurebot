caption: Differentially expressed proteins (DAPs) of HD and RBS89 plants with or without
  inoculation identified from iTRAQ data. (A) Venn diagram analysis showing the upregulated
  or downregulated proteins identified between HD and RBS89 plants with or without
  inoculation. (B) The statical number of upregulated or downregulated proteins in
  penal. (C) The upregulated (Left panel) and downregulated (Right panel) specific
  or shared DAPs in . (D) GO enrichment analysis of the DAPs (Left panel, 0 h; Middle
  panel, 24 h; Right panel, 48 h). (E) KEGG pathway analysis of the DAPs (Left panel,
  0 h; Middle panel, 24 h; Right panel, 48 h).
