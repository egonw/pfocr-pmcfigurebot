caption: 'Canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways. Canonical Signaling-
  Wnt-Off: At the plasma membrane, both the Frizzled receptor (FZD) and LRP5/6 receptor
  stand inoperative, when in lack of Wnt ligand. In the cytoplasm, the destruction
  complex (consisted of GSK-3β, APC, CK-1 and Axin) bind and phosphorylate β-catenin,
  followed by its proteasomal degradation. In the nucleus, Wnt target gene expression
  remains off. Canonical signaling- Wnt-On: When Wnt ligand binds to the Frizzled
  receptor, an active receptor complex is formed by sequestering LRP5/6 receptor.
  This brings the inactivation destruction complex and signalosome formation mediated
  by Dishevelled (DVL). Thus β-catenin, after translocating into the nucleus, binds
  to T cell factor gene region and forms a transcriptional protein-activator complex
  in order for Wnt target genes to become expressable. Non-canonical Wnt/PCP pathway:
  Wnt ligand binds to the Frizzled receptor thus recruiting Dishevelled. They form
  a complex, with co-receptors such as ROR and RYK included, in order for RhoA/Rock
  pathway to be activated and actin to become polymerized. This particular pathway
  can instigate JNK pathway''s operation via Frizzled-Dishevelled-ROR/RYK system or
  VANGL planar cell polarity protein-ROR/RYK system. Non-canonical Wnt/Ca2+pathway:
  Frizzled receptor sequesters ROR&RYK receptors when Wnt ligand binds and trigger
  the membrane proteins Dishevelled and Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins to operate
  and consequently activate Plc enzyme to release Ca2+ from within the cell. High
  amounts of Ca2+ trigger other pathways to initiate their activity assisted by activating
  receptor molecules like CaN (calcium-dependent serine–threonine phosphatase), CaM-kinase
  II (Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) and PKC (protein kinase C).'
