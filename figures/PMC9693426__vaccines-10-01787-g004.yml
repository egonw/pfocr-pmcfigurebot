caption: 'Metabolomics analysis. (A) QC sample correlation. The abscissa and ordinate
  are the QC samples, and the closer the value of R2 is to 1, the better the correlation.
  (B) PCA analysis. The abscissa PC1 and the ordinate PC2 represent the scores of
  the first and second principal components, respectively, and the scattered points
  in different colors represent samples from different experimental groups. (C) Total
  differential metabolite-cluster heat map. Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed
  on the differential metabolites between each comparison pair, and the relative quantitative
  values of the differential metabolites were normalized, transformed and clustered.
  The horizontal is the clustering of metabolites, and the vertical is the sample
  grouping. (D) Plot of differential metabolite correlation analysis. By calculating
  the Pearson correlation coefficient between all the differential metabolites and
  selecting the top 20 differential metabolites with the significance level p-value
  sorted from small to large for display, you can check the consistency of the metabolite
  and metabolite change trends. (E) Sample comparison versus volcano plot. The volcano
  plot is drawn according to the VIP value, p-value and FC value of the differential
  metabolites between the comparison pairs, which can visually display the overall
  distribution of the differential metabolites. (F) KEGG-enrichment bubble map: according
  to the KEGG enrichment results, select the top 20 pathways with p-values from small
  to large to draw a bubble map. The abscissa is x/y (the number of differential metabolites
  in the corresponding metabolic pathway/the total number of metabolites identified
  in the pathway); the larger the value, the higher the enrichment of differential
  metabolites in the pathway. The ordinate is the KEGG pathway name.'
