figure_title: Basolateral localization of Punt is conserved in MDCK cells and maps
  to a short region of the cytoplasmic domain
caption: '(A–D) Chimeric proteins of Punt and Wit map the BLT activity to the cytoplasmic
  domain of Punt. The chimeric proteins comprise the extracellular and TM region (Ecto)
  and the cytoplasmic (Cyto) regions of the indicated proteins, with a carboxyl-terminal
  FLAG epitope (green umbrella symbol) for detection by IF. Wit:Wit staining overlapped
  with the apical marker (B), as did staining for the Punt:Wit chimera (C). TheWit:Punt
  chimera displayed basolateral distribution (D). Single prime (′) images show boxed
  areas at higher magnification. (E–I) Fly Punt expressed in polarized mammalian MDCK
  cells displayed basolateral localization, but does not require the same region as
  TβRII. A schematic shows the features of Punt relative to the plasma membrane (E).
  The amino-terminal ectoplasmic portion is separated from the cytoplasmic domain
  by the vertical bar indicating the plasma membrane. The HA tag and the corresponding
  position of the LTA motif are shown in red, with numbers indicating FL Punt and
  truncation positions. (F–I) xz projections from confocal images of intact epithelium
  transiently expressing HA-Punt constructs, with apical to the top of each image,
  as indicated. Nuclei are stained with DAPI (blue) and surface receptors are stained
  with anti-HA (red). FL Punt and variants harboring deletions of extended segments
  of the cytoplasmic domain were all detected at the basolateral membrane but excluded
  from the apical membrane. See  for additional deletion constructs that retain basolateral
  distribution. Scale bars: 100 μm for B, C, D; 15 μm for B′, C′, D′; 25 μm for F–I
  (scale varies slightly for xz projections in F–I). BLT, basolateral targeting; FL,
  full length; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; TM, transmembrane region.'
