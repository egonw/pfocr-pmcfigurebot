caption: ALKBH5/IGF2BP1-mediated m6A modification contributed to SH3BP5-AS1 overexpression.
  A ALKBH5 was downregulated in pancreatic cancer tumor tissues compared with the
  paired adjacent tissues, as revealed by RT-qPCR. B The negative correlation between
  the levels of ALKBH5 and SH3BP5-AS1 was confirmed using the TCGA database. C The
  RIP RT-qPCR assay revealed that m6A modification of SH3BP5-AS1 was mainly enriched
  in pancreatic cancer cells (BxPC-3, PANC-1) compared with HPDE6-C7. D, E The expression
  level of SH3BP5-AS1when ALKBH5 was overexpressed or silenced. F The relationship
  between ALKBH5 and SH3BP5-AS1 was confirmed by the luciferase reporter assay. G,
  H RIP RT-qPCR results showing the m6A modification level of SH3BP5-AS1 when ALKBH5
  was overexpressed or silenced. I SH3BP5-AS1 stability analysis in BxPC-3 cells with
  ALKBH5 overexpression or knockdown in the presence of actinomycin D. J The negative
  correlation between the levels of IGF2BP1 and SH3BP5-AS1 in pancreatic cancer cells.
  K The enrichment of IGF2BP1 on SH3BP5-AS1 in pancreatic cancer cells was analyzed
  by RIP RT-qPCR assay. L, M The expression level of SH3BP5-AS1 when IGF2BP1 was overexpressed
  or knocked down. N Actinomycin D assays showing the effects of ALKBH5 overexpression
  or knockdown on IGF2BP1 stability. O RIP RT-qPCR assay results showing the enrichment
  of IGF2BP1 on SH3BP5-AS1 upon ALKBH5 silencing. Data are shown as the mean ± SD.
