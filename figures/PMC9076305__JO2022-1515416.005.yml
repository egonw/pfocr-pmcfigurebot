caption: Cholesterol stimulates the progression of CRC via activating the PI3K/AKT.
  (a) p-AKT and AKT in SW480 and HCT116 cell lines treated with or without cholesterol
  and in CRC tissues of mice in the ND, HFD, and HFHC groups. (b) p-STAT3, STAT3,
  p-p38, and p38 in cells and in CRC tissues of mice in the ND, HFD, and HFHC groups.
  (c) IC50 values of BAY80-6946. (d) Cell viability was determined in SW480 and HCT116
  cells treated with cholesterol or cholesterol + BAY80 − 6946 for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,
  5, and 6 days. Colony formation ability was also analyzed in cells treated with
  cholesterol or cholesterol + BAY80 − 6946. (e) Body weight of mice in the ND, HFD,
  HFHC, and HFHC + BAY80 − 6946 groups. (f) Tumor number and tumor size of mice in
  the ND, HFD, HFHC, and HFHC + BAY80 − 6946 groups.
