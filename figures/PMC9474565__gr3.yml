caption: 'Derivation of the optimal pathway activation profile. A: illustrative example
  of derivation using two DBS protocols per patient in a 2-D pathway activation space.
  Note that in our problem the space has 14 dimensions. Values of Pi denote the corresponding
  UPDRS-III scores for -th patient, “+” and “−” subscripts refer to the more and less
  effective stimulation protocols, respectively. Divergent datapoints, i.e. those
  with a large difference in percent activation (a fraction of axons in the pathway
  that elicited an action potential in response to the DBS pulse) and small difference
  in motor improvement (P4 here), were not considered for the derivation of the optimal
  profile. B: the intrapatient interprotocol UPDRS-III improvement in the training
  cohort with and without the normalization by the mean of percent activation differences.
  The normalized metric was used to select datapoints for the derivation of the optimal
  profile.'
