caption: CeapinA7 and GSK621 inhibit GREM1-induced CRC cellline invasion and migration.
  (A) The GSEA was performed using an in-house RNA-seq dataset to identify gene sets
  in the KEGG collections that have positive correlations with GREM1 expression. The
  negative regulating PERK-mediated UPR (NES = 1.6542 NP = 0.0000) and ATF6-mediated
  UPR signaling pathway (NES = 1.3553, NP = 0.0000) with GREM1 overexpression in HCT116
  cells. (B) HCT116 pLV-GREM1 and SW480 pLV-GREM1 cells were seeded into Matrigel-coated
  inserts with medium containing CeapinA7 (16 μM) or GSK621 (30 μM) and incubated
  for 36 h, followed by the invasion assay. (C,D) Wound healing test revealed that
  CeapinA7 and GSK621 inhibited cell migration.
