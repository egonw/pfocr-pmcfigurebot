caption: 'Addition of not only lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) and lysophosphatidylglycerol
  (LPG), but also intermediate products of the S1P lyase (SPL)‐mediated metabolic
  pathway, reversed the retarded cell proliferation in SPL‐inhibited cell lines. (A)
  Analysis of cell proliferation in SPL‐inhibited cell lines further with the addition
  of LPI 18:1 or LPG 18:1 at a concentration of 1 μM for 24 h of incubation. Black
  and gray colour‐filled bars show control cell lines, and white bars show two selected
  colonies of SPL‐inhibited cell lines, with cherry red indicating the addition of
  LPI and purple indicating the addition of LPG (N = 8). (B and C) Cell proliferation
  analysis performed (N = 8) in the SPL‐inhibited cell lines by adding PE (B) and
  Hexa (C) at three different concentrations under glucose present conditions. (D
  and F) PI levels were measured by liquid chromatography‐tandem mass spectrometry
  (LC‐MS/MS) in SPL‐inhibited and control cell lines with or without the addition
  of PE (5 μM; blue) and Hexa (10 μM; green). (&) indicates the difference between
  the control and SPL‐inhibited cell lines, (*) indicates the difference between the
  control, and SPL‐inhibited and PE‐ or Hexa‐added cell lines, (#) indicates the difference
  between the control, and SPL‐inhibited and PE‐ or Hexa‐added cell lines; p < .05.
  (E and G) The same cells in Figure  and  were used for the measurements of the total
  LPI and LPG. (&) indicates the difference between the control and SPL‐inhibited
  cell lines, (*) indicates the difference between the control, and SPL‐inhibited
  and PE‐ or Hexa‐ added cell lines, (#) indicates the difference between SPL inhibited
  cell lines without PE/Hexa addition, and SPL‐inhibited and PE‐ or Hexa‐ added cell
  lines. (H) alkaline phosphatase transforming growth factor‐α (AP‐TGFα) release responses
  of GPR55 to glycero‐LPLs. A strong response was observed for LPI and LPG. (I) Cell
  proliferation assay performed in GPR55‐receptor‐inhibited cell lines; left: Colon
  26 cell lines; right: SPL‐overexpressing cell lines. Two single‐colony cell lines
  were used for two different sets of experiments. Gray and dark gray bars represent
  control cell lines without GPR55 inhibition, white and light gray bars represent
  GPR55‐inhibited cell lines (N = 8). (J) Cell proliferation assays performed in three
  different cell lines (N = 16) and control cell lines (N = 8) when PE (5 μM, blue
  dots) and LPI 18:1 (1 μM, cherry red dots) were added. (K) Western blotting (WB)
  analysis of total and phosphorylated AKT, JNK, ERK, p38, and beta‐actin in cell
  lines with different expression levels of SPL and GPR55, including control cell
  lysates. (L) Quantification of WB by densitometry using the NIH ImageJ. WB bands
  from three repeats of the same set of samples were used, and the phosphorylation
  rates were quantified. (*) indicates differences with EV, (#) indicates differences
  with SPL overexpressing cell line, (&) indicates differences with HR. (*), (#),
  (&): p < .05; (**), (##), (&&): p < .01; (***), (###), (&&&): p < .001. Differences
  between the two groups were statistically analysed using the unpaired Student''s
  t‐test, and differences more than two groups were analysed using one‐way ANOVA.

  SPL knock out cell lines by using CRIPR/Cas9 system; Cr/SPL+PE or Hexa, phosphoethanolamine
