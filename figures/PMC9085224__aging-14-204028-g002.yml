caption: MiR-181a-5p was downregulated in 4 paired human ESCC tissues. (A) H&E staining
  was used to identified ESCC tissues and their corresponding adjacent peri-cancerous
  tissue specimens, RT-qPCR of miR-181a-5p expression in human ESCC tissues. *P <
  0.05, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma vs. peri-cancerous tissue. (B) Kaplan-Meier's
  method was used for survival analysis and miR-181 survival curve was drawn. (C)
  Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to depict the overall survival curves of patients
  with of ESCC from the data in GSE114110.
