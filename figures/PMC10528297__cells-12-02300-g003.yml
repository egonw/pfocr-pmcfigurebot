caption: Proteomic analysis of the CPC exosomal compartment (A) Angiogenic activity
  of CPC (isolates CPC1 & CPC2) exosome preparations (107 and 108 exosomal particles),
  was evaluated in HUVEC. Negative (serum-free medium 199) and positive (FBS + FGF
  in medium 199) controls were included. After 6 h of incubation, tube formation was
  analyzed using ImageJ software. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD (n = 3); p values
  were (**) <0.01; (*) <0.05. (B) After whole label-free proteomic analysis of three
  independent CPC isolates (CPC1-CPC3), the distribution of the CPC exosome proteome
  (1339 proteins) was organized by functional activity. (C) The most relevant cytokines
  and growth factors (left) and GPCRs and transmembrane receptors (right) are indicated.
  (D,E) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of the CPC exosomal compartment demonstrated
  high significant representation (p value < 10−15) of several cellular functions
  (D) as well as prominent signaling pathways (E).
