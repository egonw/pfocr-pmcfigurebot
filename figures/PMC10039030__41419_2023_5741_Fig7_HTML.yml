caption: LPS induced Kupffer cells lipid metabolism remodeling and high GPAT3 expression.
  GPAT3 plays a critical role in the pro-inflammatory response and mitochondrial function
  by regulating the synthesis of LPA and up-regulate P-ERK signaling pathway.
article_title: GPAT3 regulates the synthesis of lipid intermediate LPA and exacerbates
  Kupffer cell inflammation mediated by the ERK signaling pathway.
