caption: OTX1 is upregulated in cervical cancer tissue and cells. (A) OTX1 expression
  in cancer was analyzed by TCGA. (B) TCGA analysis showed OTX1 was upregulated in
  cervical cancer tissues. *P<0.05 vs. Normal group. (C) Kaplan-Meier plotter analysis
  based on TCGA database showed that survival probability was worse in patients with
  high OTX1 expression. (D) Immunohistochemical staining and (E) RT-qPCR showed that
  OTX1 was highly expressed in cervical cancer tissue. *P<0.05 vs. Normal group. (F)
  RT-qPCR and western blot analysis showed that OTX1 was highly expressed in cervical
  cancer cells. All experiments were performed in triplicate. *P<0.05 vs. H8 cells.
