caption: 'Brief flowchart of tea tender leaves scRNA‐seq. The 1st and 3rd leaves of
  young shoot of C. sinensis var Shuchazao, representing 1 L and 3 L, respectively,
  were used for single‐cell transcriptomics. Protoplasts were obtained by enzymatic
  hydrolysis. mRNA released by rupture of a single‐cell suspension was combined with
  gel bead and emulsion to form GEMs [10× Genomics Chromium Single‐Cell 3′ kit (V3)].
  The mRNA of the cell was independently reverse‐transcribed in each GEM, and tagged
  cDNA was mixed and amplified for library construction. Libraries were sequenced
  on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing system (paired‐end multiplexing run, 150 bp)
  by LC‐Bio Technology co. ltd., (Hangzhou, China). Six tissues of 3 L were used for
  cDNA preparation to identify cluster‐specific genes expression pattern by qRT‐PCR.
