caption: 'Laponite activates PI3K/AKT signal transduction pathway-related proteins
  (p-PI3K, p-AKT) of BMSCs in hydrogel scaffolds to promote osteogenic differentiation
  in vitro. Expression levels of target proteins as determined by western blotting
  (a) and phosphorylation levels of PI3K, AKT and mTOR proteins were significantly
  higher in Hyd_Lap group (b) compared with Blank and Hyd groups. αp<0.05 vs Blank;
  βp<0.05 vs Hyd. (c, d) Expression levels of Runx2 and Col 1α in Hyd_Lap group, Blank
  and Hyd groups. Protein levels of Runx2 and Col 1α were significantly suppressed
  in Hyd_Lap ​+ ​LY294002 group after treatment with LY294002. αp<0.05 vs Blank; βp<0.05
  vs Hyd; γp<0.05 vs Hyd_Lap. (e, f) Mineralization nodules were higher in Hyd_Lap
  than in Hyd group, and treatment of LY294002 reduced mineralization nodules. Scale
  bars: black 200 ​μm; red 100 ​μm αp<0.05 vs Hyd; βp<0.05 vs Hyd_Lap. (For interpretation
  of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
  Web version of this article.)'
