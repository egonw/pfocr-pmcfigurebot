figure_title: Computational interrogation of the mesocircuit architecture and dynamics
  underlying emergence of the ERNA waveform
caption: 'A Schematic of the mesocircuit architecture which was able to emulate ERNA
  based on B DBS-induced depression of cortico-STN inputs (10% fidelity), persistent
  activation of GPe-STN inputs and recruited GPe-GPe axon collaterals (65% fidelity),
  and STN-GPe efferents (80% fidelity); OU = Ornstein–Uhlenbeck; U = utilization constant;
  τfacil = facilitation constant; τrec = recovery constant. C Modeling results showing
  the emergence of ERNA when (i) the aforementioned mesocirccuit properties are considered,
  but lack of ability to reproduce the ERNA waveform (ii) during low frequency stimulation
  (LFS; i.e., when short-term synaptic dynamics are not considered), (iii) with depressing
  STN efferent fidelity, and (iv) in the absence of intrinsic GPe-GPe connectivity;
  highlighting the importance of each of these considerations. Upper panels: STN conductances
  in response to HFS. Lower panels: In silico dynamics of first (dark blue) and second
  (light blue) ERNA peaks; shade represents standard deviation of the mean; all plots
  depict the average of (n = 10) iterations of the model output.'
