caption: LrB suppressed the expression of PAI-1 and the activation of TGF-β1/Smad
  signaling pathway in MI/R mice. (a) Representative images showing the distribution
  of PAI-1 in cardiac tissues after immunofluorescence staining. Scar bar = 50 μm.
  (b, c) Relative mRNA and protein expression of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)
  and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) in the cardiac tissues. (d) Western
  blot analysis for TGF-β1R, TGF-β1, p-Smad2/3, and Smad2/3. Relative protein expression
  of (e) PAI-1, (f) TGF-β1R, (g) TGF-β1, (h) p-Smad2/3, and (i) Smad2/3 in the cardiac
  tissues. Values are expressed as mean ± SD (n = 6). +++p < 0.001vs. sham group.
  ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001vs. MI/R group.
