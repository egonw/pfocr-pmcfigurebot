caption: MAT2A-regulated protein synthesis is independent of mTORC1.A and B, Western
  blotting for the mTOR pathway proteins after treating cells at different concentrations
  of cLEU for 6 h using HeLa (A) and Hepa1 (B) cells. In lane 2, cells were treated
  with 400 nM rapamycin for 1 h. cLEU, cycloleucine; mTORC1, mechanistic target of
  rapamycin complex 1.
article_title: mTORC1-independent translation control in mammalian cells by methionine
  adenosyltransferase 2A and S-adenosylmethionine.
