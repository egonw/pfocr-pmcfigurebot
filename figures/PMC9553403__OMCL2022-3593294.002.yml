caption: 'Surgery induced cognitive impairment in aged mice. The mice were randomly
  divided into 3 groups: Sham group, dNCR group, and dNCR+Fer-1 group. (a) Escape
  latency during the MWM navigation test. (b) The representative trajectory diagrams
  of the swimming distance to find the platform (blue dots: starting position; yellow
  dots: ending position). (c) The platform-crossing times in the MWM test. (d) The
  time spent in the target quadrant during the MWM test. Data are expressed as mean
  ± SEM (n = 5/group). ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01, Sham vs. dNCR; @@P < 0.01, dNCR vs.
  dNCR+Fer-1. Fer-1: ferrostatin-1, a ferroptosis inhibitor.'
