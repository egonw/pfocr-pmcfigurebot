caption: GSDME mediated pyroptosis of CRC cells in response to GA treatment. HCT116
  and CT26 cells were transfected with siGSDME or siNC and then treated with GA (2
  μmol/L or 1 μmol/L) for 12 h. (A) SiNC- or siGSDME-infected HCT116 and CT26 cells
  were treated with GA, and representative bright-field images were obtained. The
  white arrows point to pyroptotic cells. (B) Expression of GSDME and cleaved caspase-3
  in siNC- or siGSDME-transfected HCT116 and CT26 cells treated with GA analysed by
  western blotting. The whole western blots were shown in . (C) The release of LDH
  and (D) flow cytometric analysis were performed after treatment with GA. The cells
  were exposed to 0.1% DMSO as control. All experiments were repeated three times
  and results were expressed as mean ± SD. NC, negative control. * p < 0.05 vs. control,
  ** p < 0.01 vs. control.
