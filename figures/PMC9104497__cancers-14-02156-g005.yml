caption: 'Protein expression analysis of mir-150-5p direct targets and members of
  the ERK1/2 pathway in the TNBC transfected cells. (A) Network of miR-150-5p and
  experimentally validated target genes (Cytoscape 3.9.1). (B) Western blotting and
  quantitative readings of miR-150-5p mRNA targets and members of the SRC pathway
  markers in transfected and NC MDA-MB-231 cells. (C) Proposed model of miR-150-5p
  regulation of the SRC pathway. NC: negative control.'
