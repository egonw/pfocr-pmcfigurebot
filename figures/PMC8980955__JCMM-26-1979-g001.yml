caption: Renoprotective effect of NAD+ depends on SIRT1. (A‐B) Representative haematoxylin
  and eosin‐stained kidney sections (scale bars, 50 μm) and scored damaged tubules
  in LPS and NMN‐treated C57BL/6 mice with or without EX‐527. Renal functions and
  damaged markers evaluated by BUN (C), Scr (D), KIM‐1 (E) and NGAL (F) in different
  groups. (G‐H) Representative TUNEL staining images (scale bars, 100 μm) and quantified
  by TUNEL‐positive cells in indicated groups. Each result was replicated in three
  independent experiments, and the values are the mean ±SD (n = 3). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01
article_title: NAD+ ameliorates endotoxin‐induced acute kidney injury in a sirtuin1–dependent
  manner via GSK‐3β/Nrf2 signalling pathway.
