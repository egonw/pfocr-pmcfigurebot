caption: Early response of immune-challenged SC-islets profiled by single-cell transcription
  analysis after co-culture with human allogeneic PBMCs(A) hESC-derived SC-islets
  were co-cultured with human allogeneic PBMCs (n = 2 donors) for 0, 24, and 48h,
  followed by scRNA-seq for gene expression.(B) Volcano plot of differential expressed
  genes in SC-α or SC-β after 24-h co-culture with PBMCs compared with control (t =
  0).(C) Pathway analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of upregulated genes
  in co-cultured SC-β (48 h).(D) Dot plot representing expression of selected inflammatory
  genes in groups of SC-α and SC-β over time in co-culture with PBMCs.(E) Venn diagrams
  feature significantly upregulated genes (log2 fold change >1 and adjusted p values
  <0.05) obtained from in vivo (blue) and in vitro (red) SC-α/SC-β scRNA-seq data
  ( and ) that are common to CRISPR screen hits (positively enriched in hPi-mice,
  log2 fold change >1) (green).(F) Violin plots of SC-β timed expression of selected
  genes. See also F.(G) UMAP plots of SC-islet cells expressing CXCL10 or STAT1 over
  time in co-culture with PBMCs. Specific endocrine cell type clustering is indicated.(H)
  ELISA for human CXCL10, from supernatant of co-culture of SC-islets and PBMCs. n =
  2 donors. Error bars are mean ± SD. Dashed line is the lower detection limit, while
  any data below it is extrapolated.(I) IF staining of SC-islet clusters ±48-h co-culture
  with PBMC. C-peptide staining (green) for SC-β and DAPI (blue) for nuclei. Bars
  represent 100 μm in main panels and 50 μm in magnified panels.
