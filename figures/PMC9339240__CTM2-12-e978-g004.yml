caption: 'Emergence of STAT1 in advanced PCa contributes to the acquisition of self‐renewal
  capacity in PCSCs. (A,B) GSEA identifying upregulation of genes associated with
  IFNα and IFNγ response in the tumour specimens of PCa patients with lymph node metastasis
  (N1, Red, n = 80), compared to cohort without metastasis (N0, Blue, n = 345). (C)
  TCGA PCa dataset demonstrating STAT1 expression level among stage T2 (n = 187),
  T3 (n = 293) and T4 (n = 11) PCa patients. (D) TCGA PCa dataset demonstrating elevation
  of STAT1 in PCa patients with lymph node metastasis (N1, n = 80), compared to cohort
  without metastasis (N0, n = 345). (E) Clinical correlation of STAT1 with interferon
  response‐associated genes (N = 550) derived from TCGA PCa dataset was calculated
  using Pearson Correlation. (F) Expression level of interferon response‐associated
  genes in PCa patients with lymph node metastasis (N1, n = 80), compared to cohort
  without metastasis (N0, n = 345). (G) The sphere forming ability of sgTP53/RB1‐LNCaP
  cell, compared to vector control (sgNT). (H) Protein level of STAT1, RB1 and TP53
  in sgTP53/RB1‐LNCaP cell, compared to vector control (sgNT). (I) Left: morphology
  of DU145, 22Rv1 and C4‐2 cells under adherent monolayer or ultra‐low attachment
  sphere culture condition. Right: JAK1 and STAT1 protein expression in the sphere
  (S) derived from each PCa line, compared to corresponding monolayer (M) culture.
  (J) Heat map illustrating the expression profile of JAK‐STAT signalling pathway
  molecules in the sphere (S) derived from LNCaP cells, compared to monolayer (M)
  adherent culture. (K,L) Dose‐dependent impact of fludarabine and ruxolitinib on
  the sphere forming ability of sgTP53/RB1‐LNCaP cells. Cells were treated with either
  fludarabine or ruxolitinib at corresponding concentration right after seeding into
  the ultra‐low attachment plate. Quantitation of sphere forming ability is done at
  2 weeks afterward. (ns = no significant differences, *p < .05, **p < .001, ***p < .0001)'
