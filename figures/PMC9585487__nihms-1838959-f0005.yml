  presentation
caption: (A) Network plot showing the connections of upregulated genes upon PRC2 restoration
  (top four significantly enriched pathways shown). DEGs were derived from comparing
  the effect of PRC2 restoration to controls in all three PRC2-null MPNST cell lines
  using RNA-seq ().(B) Quantification of DEGs demonstrating that the genes that were
  upregulated after PRC2 restoration were not direct PRC2 targets and did not gain
  H3K27me3 with a functional PRC2.(C) Quantification of the PRC2-target DEGs shows
  that they were not bivalent genes.(D) Enrichment plot demonstrating that PRC2 restoration
  significantly increased genes in the GO pathway “Response to type I interferon”.(E)
  Enrichment plot showing that genes associated with the pathway “Antigen presentation
  folder assembly and peptide loading of class I MHC” were significantly increased
  upon PRC2 restoration.(F) Enrichment plot showing that Ras signaling genes () were
  inhibited by PRC2 restoration in T265 cells. NES, normalized enrichment score.(G)
  Heatmap of key STAT and IRF transcription factors shows that mRNA expression levels
  of these transcription factors were increased by PRC2 restoration.(H) Heatmap showing
  the transcriptional activation of STAT and IRF members caused by MEK inhibitor treatment
  in T265 cells.(I) Histogram of flow cytometry result demonstrating the increase
  in cell-surface expression of MHCI in three PRC2-deficient cell lines after trametinib
  treatment.
