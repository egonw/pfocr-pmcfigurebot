caption: Log fold change of selected genes. Fold change was calculated by Pfaffl equation.
  The increase in relative gene expression of growth factors (VEGF, PDGFRB, HGF) and
  MAPK1 suggested that sofosbuvir promoted HCC. However, sofosbuvir negatively affected
  the HCC development by downregulating the expression of kinases (H-RAS, B-RAF and
  MET). The negative feedback inhibitors of ERK signalling cascade DUSP1 and SPRY2
  were upregulated and downregulated, respectively.
