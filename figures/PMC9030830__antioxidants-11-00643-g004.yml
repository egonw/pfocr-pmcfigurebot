caption: 'Rh1 inhibits the Ang II-induced proliferation and migration of VSMCs by
  regulating KLF4. (A,B) RASMCs were pretreated with Rh1 (25 and 50 µM) before 24
  h of exposure to Ang II (100 nM). Western blot analysis was used to analyze the
  levels of indicated proteins in the whole-cell lysates. (C–E) The cells were transfected
  with 100 nM KLF4 siRNA (si-KLF4) or control siRNA (si-Cont) and maintained for 24
  h. The cells were then pretreated with Rh1 (50 µM) or losartan (10 µM) for 3 h,
  which was followed by treatment with 100 nM Ang II for 24 h. Cell proliferation
  was examined by the SRB assay (C), and cell migration was evaluated by the wound-healing
  assay (D,E). (B,C,E) The data are presented as the mean ± SEM (n = 3), *** p < 0.001
  compared with the control. ## p < 0.01 and ### p < 0.001 compared with the Ang II-treated
  sample. $ p < 0.05, and $$$ p < 0.001 compared with the corresponding sample.'
