caption: 'Expression of APT1 in atherosclerosis model. (A,B), APT1 expression level
  in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC); (C), pathological staining of
  aorta; (D,E), blood lipids and mouse body weight results; (F,G), APT1 expression
  level in aorta; (H), The RNA expression level of APT1 in heart and liver tissue.
  A: whole cell; M: membrane; P: cytoplasm; HE: hematoxylin and eosin staining; SR:
  Sirius red staining; NC: control group; M: model group. The results are shown by
  mean Â± standard deviation; the above experiments are repeated three times; * represents
  p < 0.05.'
