caption: Overall expression of DNA-damage signaling genes in (parental, HPV-negative)
  FaDu cells and (HPV-positive) 2A3 cells after exposure to cisplatin (CDDP), radiation
  (IR) or their combination (CDDP+IR). Symbols are mean gene expression for each of
  the 84 DNA-damage signaling genes included on the Human DNA Damage Signaling Pathway
  RT2 ProfilerTM PCR Array from 3 independent experiments. The lines indicate the
  median gene expression of all tested genes.* p < 0.05; *** p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001
