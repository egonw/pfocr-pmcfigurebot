caption: 'IL-17 signaling pathway is involved in tumorigenesis and drug resistance
  of HCT15 cells. A. CCK-8 assay was performed to detect cell viability of HCT15 cells
  with or without CXCL17 silence upon IL-17A supplementation; B. CCK-8 assay for cell
  resistance was applied to detect the cell viability of HCT15 cells with or without
  CXCL17 silence which treated with different concentrations of taxol; C. Wound-healing
  assay was used to evaluate cell migration ability of HCT15 cells treated with IL-17A
  followed by siNC or si-CXCL17 transfection; D. Transwell assay was applied to analyze
  cell invasion ability of HCT15 treated with IL-17A followed by siNC or si-CXCL17
  transfection; E. Flow cytometry was used to detect the cell cycle of HCT15 cells
  treated with IL-17A followed by siNC or si-CXCL17 transfection; F. Flow cytometry
  was used to detect the cell apoptosis of HCT15 cells treated with IL-17A followed
  by siNC or si-CXCL17 transfection. Scale bar was 50 Î¼m. Compared with the siNC group,
  **P < 0.01; compared with the si-CXCL17 group, #P < 0.05; ##P < 0.01.'
