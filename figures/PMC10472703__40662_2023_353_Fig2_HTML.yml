caption: Representative raw electroretinography (ERG) waveforms. The representative
  raw ERG waveforms of db/+ mice (grey) and db/db mice (blue) recorded at 9 and 25 weeks
  of age at four different stimulus intensities belonging to four different light
  zones, as described previously []. The scotopic threshold response (STR) refers
  to the response from the first light zone, which is suggested to arise from third-order
  retinal cells, including ganglion cells and amacrine cells. Responses from the second
  light zone (i.e., − 3.3 log cd·s/m2) represent predominantly rods to rod-depolarizing
  bipolar cells responses, while those from the third light zone (i.e., − 1.3 log
  cd·s/m2) consist of responses from rods to rod-depolarizing bipolar cells and rods
  to cone-depolarizing bipolar cells. In addition, the responses from the fourth light
  zone (i.e., + 1.3 log cd·s/m2) involve signals from the cone-related pathway
