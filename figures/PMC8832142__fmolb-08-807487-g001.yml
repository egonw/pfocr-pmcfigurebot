caption: Signal pathway that affects metabolic pathways in osteoblast. The HIF stimulates
  glycolysis and inhibits oxidative phosphorylation. The Wnt signaling pathway and
  PTH stimulate glycolysis and inhibit oxidative phosphorylation through mTORC2 and
  promote the ß-oxidation of fatty acids. Notch signaling pathway and ERRα stimulate
  the expression of respiratory chain complex and promote mitochondrial OXPHOS. The
  Wnt signaling pathway and ERRα stimulates GLS expression, thereby promoting the
  conversion of glutamine to α-kg into the TCA cycle. The HIF signaling pathway promotes
  glycolysis flux and inhibits TCA cycling and reduces ROS production.
