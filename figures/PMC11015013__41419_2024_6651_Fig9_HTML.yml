figure_title: DTL-RUVBL1-β-catenin regulates radiation resistance of breast cancer
  cells
caption: A Western blot for RUVBL1, DTL, β-catenin and β-actin in MDA-MB-231 control,
  RUVBL1, RUVBL1-DTL, RUVBL1-DTL-shβ-catenin#1 and RUVBL1-DTL-shβ-catenin#2 stably
  expressed cells (HA-DTL; Myc-RUVBL1). B–D The above cell lines were treated with
  radiation (0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 Gy), followed by MTT assay and clonogenic survival assay
  (n = 3). E 2 × 105 the above cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice (n = 5).
  Since the twelfth day, each group of nude mice were treated with radiation (Every
  3 days, 3 Gy each time). Tumor growth curves were shown. Tumors (F) and tumor size
  (G) of mice were shown. H Schematic diagram. RUVBL1 ubiquitination by DTL promotes
  RUVBL1/2-β-catenin-mediated transcriptional regulation of NHEJ pathway and enhances
  radiation resistance in breast cancer. Data presented as mean ± SD, statistical
  differences were assessed using two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test (B, D, E, G).
