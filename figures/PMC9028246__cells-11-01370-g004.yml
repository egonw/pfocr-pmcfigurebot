caption: Targeting Hippo and YAP/TAZ. Therapeutic agents promoting Hippo activation
  or YAP/TAZ inhibition are shown in red. Grey arrows and molecules indicate inhibition
  of downstream processes. Cetuximab-mediated EGFR inhibition, Alpelisib-mediated
  PI3K inhibition, Dasatinib-mediated SRC inhibition, Defactinib and IN10018-mediated
  FAK inhibition, and Trametinib-mediated MEK inhibition relieve Hippo-inhibitory
  inputs and enable Hippo signaling to inhibit YAP/TAZ. Tankyrase inhibitors prevent
  proteolytic degradation of AMOT, enabling AMOT to activate Hippo signaling. Small
  molecule TEAD inhibitors (smTEADi) prevent YAP/TAZ:TEAD interaction by inhibiting
  TEAD autopalmitoylation. Verteporfin inhibits YAP/TAZ:TEAD interaction [,,,,,,,,].
