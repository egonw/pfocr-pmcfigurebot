caption: Schematic representation of the HO-1 regulation and its role in the procession
  of neurodegeneration and neuroprotection. In neurodegeneration, proinflammatory
  factors induce HO-1 expression via MAPKs, NF-κB, and AP-1 in glial cells. However,
  several herbal medicines induce HO-1 expression via Nrf2-dependent pathway in neuronal
  cells, indicating the major route of HO-1 induction for neuroprotective function.
  Thus, in brain, the final impact of upregulated HO-1 is depend on the stimulatory
  factors, the activated signaling pathways, and the stimulated cell-type.
