figure_title: Changes in Notch activity in Lfng and Dll3 mutants are not directly
  caused by alterations in the levels of the signaling molecules
caption: Western blot analysis was performed on pooled tissue lysates from 4 whole
  PSMs or 4 caudal PSMs (posterior 2/3) In all western blots each lane represents
  a biologically independent pool that contains 4 genotyped PSMs taken from between
  2 and 4 independent litters (n=6 independent wildype pools in 4A and n=3 independent
  pools in all other analyses). Relative protein levels were normalized to Tubulin
  expression for quantification. (A,B) Western blot analysis for NOTCH1(p120) or NICD
  on pooled whole PSMs. Quantification indicates that the protein levels of NOTCH1(p120)
  are significantly increased in Lfng−/− mutants, but unchanged in Dll3 mutants compared
  to wild-type. The ratio of NICD to NOTCH1(p120) demonstrates that Notch activation
  is significantly reduced in Dll3pu/pu PSMs compared to wild-type or Lfng−/− PSMs.
  (C,D) Western blot analysis for DLL1 on pooled whole PSMs. Quantification indicates
  that the protein levels of DLL are significantly increased in Dll3pu/pu mutants,
  but unchanged in Lfng−/− mutants compared to wild-type. Samples used in C and D
  are biologically independent from those used in A and B. (E,F) Western blot analysis
  for NOTCH1(p120) or NICD pooled posterior PSM. Quantification indicates that the
  protein levels of NOTCH1(p120) are not significantly different among the three genotypes.
  The ratio of NICD to NOTCH1(p120) demonstrates that Notch activation is significantly
  reduced in Dll3pu/pu posterior PSMs compared to wild-type or Lfng−/−. (G,H) Western
  blot analysis for DLL1 on pooled posterior PSM sample. Blots from E were stripped
  and re-probed. Quantification indicates that the protein levels of DLL1 are significantly
  increased in Dll3pu/pu posterior PSMs, but unchanged in Lfng−/− mutants compared
  to wild-type. (I) Semi-quantitative RT-PCR performed on pooled RNA isolated from
  the caudal half of 6 PSMs/lane confirms similar expression of Dll1 and Notch1 in
  three separate pools of wild-type, Lfng−/−, and Dll3pu/pu caudal PSM cDNA. Hprt
  was used as a control. (J) qRT-PCR analysis (n=3 biologically independent pools
  of PSMs of each genotype) confirms that the transcript levels of Dll and Notch1
  are not altered in the mutants compared to wild-type. Statistical analysis throughout
  included one way ANOVA followed by Tukey post-hoc with p<0.05 indicating significance
  (*). Error bars indicate SD for Western blot analysis and propagated log SEM for
  qRT PCR analysis.
