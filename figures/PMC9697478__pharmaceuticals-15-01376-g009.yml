caption: The effects of BRHE on JNK, ERK, P38, p65 (NFkB), Akt and STAT3 phosphorylation
  in RAW 264.7 cells (A) and peritoneal macrophage (C). The cells were treated with
  BRHE or LPS for 40 min. After treatment, the phosphorylated JNK, ERK P38, p65 (NFkB),
  Akt and STAT3 levels were analyzed by immunoblotting. Histogram represents quantification
  of BRHE-stimulated p-JNK, p-ERK p-JNK, p-p38, p65, p-Akt and p-STAT3 in RAW 264.7
  (B) or peritoneal macrophage samples (D). All data of relative activity are expressed
  as a comparison with untreated cells. Data are expressed as mean Â± SD of three independent
  experiments. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 versus control.
