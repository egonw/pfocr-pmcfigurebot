caption: Assessment of the ability of animal cells (HEK293T cells) to synthesize astaxanthin
  in vitro from β-carotene. (A) Expression of EGFP and HPLC analysis of cells transfected
  with pWZG-A2 + β-carotene. (B) Expression of EGFP and HPLC analysis of cells transfected
  with pbk3HZG-A2 + β-carotene. (C) Expression of EGFP and HPLC analysis of cells
  transfected with pCIKHZG-A2 + β-carotene. (D) Expression of mCherry and HPLC analysis
  of cells transfected with pWZg2R-A2 + β-carotene. (E) Expression of mCherry and
  HPLC analysis of cells transfected with pWZg1R-A2 + β-carotene. Can, canthaxanthin;
  Ast, astaxanthin; E, trans geometric isomer; and Z, cis geometric isomer. (F) Ketocarotenoid
  concentration graph for HEK293T cell extracts transfected with the above-mentioned
  plasmids. DW, dry weight. Results were presented as means ± SD of three biological
  replicates.
