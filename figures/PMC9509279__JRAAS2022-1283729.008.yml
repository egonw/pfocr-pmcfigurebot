caption: 'Aldosterone stimulates angiogenesis, and End-MT is activated by the MR/IL-1β/VEGFA
  signaling pathway. (a) The protein expression of NF-κB, IL-1β, VEGFA, and VEGFR2
  in cardiac tissue of UUO rats was detected by western blot. Each value represents
  the mean ± SD. N = 3. ∗p < 0.05 vs. sham. #p < 0.05 vs. UUO. (b) The SGK-1, NF-κB,
  and IL-1β mRNA levels were detected via real-time PCR. Each value represents the
  mean ± SD. N = 3. ∗p < 0.05 vs. Sham. #p < 0.05 vs. UUO.'
