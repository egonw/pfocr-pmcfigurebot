caption: KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway analysis of protein
  changes from whole brain of Cask+/âˆ’ mice compared to wild-type littermates. iTRAQ
  quantitative proteomic analysis was performed to evaluate global changes at protein
  level. KEGG pathway analysis was performed on the molecules. Significantly affected
  pathways are shown in metabolism (upper panel) and human disease pathway (lower
  panel) are shown. The full figure can be found in the .
