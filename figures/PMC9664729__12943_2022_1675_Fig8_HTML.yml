caption: 'ELOA mediates DLGAP1-AS2-driven CRC growth and metastasis. A-B Cell proliferation
  and colony formation abilities in WT and Trim21-KO HCT116 cells transfected with
  plasmids of DLGAP1-AS2 and ELOA. C Cell migration and invasion abilities in WT and
  Trim21-KO HCT116 cells transfected with plasmids of DLGAP1-AS2 and ELOA. D GSEA
  pathway enrichment analyses using the differentially expressed genes (DRGs) potentially
  affected by DLGAP1-AS2 and ELOA. DRGs were identified in DLGAP1-AS2-silenced and
  ELOA-overexpressing HCT116 cells using RNA-seq. E Validation of selected DRGs in
  HCT116 cells transfected with the siRNAs or plasmids of DLGAP1-AS2 and ELOA. F LHPP
  mRNA expression was detected by qRT-PCR in ELOA-overexpressing HCT116 cells. G The
  relative luciferase activity of LHPP promoter in ELOA-overexpressing HCT116 cells.
  H The recruitment of ELOA to the indicated regions of the LHPP promoter was determined
  by ChIP-PCR. IgG was used as the negative control. I The potential binding motif
  of ELOA was validated by luciferase assays. Mut: the mutant LHPP promoter lacking
  of the putative binding motif of ELOA. J Correlation analyses between DLGAP1-AS2
  and LHPP. K The effect of DLGAP1-AS2/ELOA on the AKT pathway (pAKT at Ser473)'

  by regulating the Trim21/ELOA/LHPP axis in colorectal cancer.
