caption: DHCE induced morphological changes of gastric cancer cells. (A) Morphology
  of MGC803 and SGC7901 cells treated with DHCE or not were observed under inverted
  microscope with a magnification of 200×. (B) Chromatin condensation and nuclear
  fragmentation were observed by DAPI staining under fluorescence inverted microscope
  with a magnification of 200×. (C) Normal cells, apoptotic cells, and necrotic cells
  were observed by AO/EB staining under a fluorescence inverted microscope with a
  magnification of 200×.
