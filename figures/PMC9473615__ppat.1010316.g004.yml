figure_title: IRF-dependent gene expression stimulated by ΔM062R MYXV is regulated
  through cGAS
caption: A. Infection by ΔM062R MYXV stimulates similar IRF-dependent gene expression
  to dsDNA-stimulated effect and is cGAS- dependent. THP-1-Lucia human macrophages
  with or without cGAS expression were treated by transfection with interferon-stimulated
  dsDNA (ISDs) or by infection with ΔM062R MYXV (at a moi of 10) at given time points
  for harvesting. Cell supernatant is used for luciferase assay. Shown is the representative
  of two independent biological replicates and at each given time point the data point
  is the average of the triplicate (technical replicate). Only the THP-1 cells with
  intact cGAS were able to respond with increased production of luciferase in either
  treatment. Two-way ANOVA and multiple comparisons are performed to compare cGAS
  effect to the luciferase detection with time for either ΔM062R or ISD stimulation,
  and a statistical significance is defined as *p<0.05 and ****p<0.0001. Both time
  and the presence of cGAS significantly affected the readout (p<0.0001). B. Infection
  by ΔM062R MYXV leads to phosphorylation of IRF3. Differentiated THP1 cells are infected
  with either ΔM062R or WT MYXV at a moi of 5 and cell lysates are harvested at the
  given time points for western blot. A total protein of 25 μg is loaded per sample.
  Phosphorylated and total IRF3 are probed with β-actin as internal loading control.
  C. Addition of 2’3’-cGAMP bypasses the cGAS deficit and leads to the induction of
  luciferase activity through the luciferase assay. Transfection of 2’3’-cGAMP at
  the given doses, the enzymatic product from activated cGAS, produces an identical
  response in both wild type and cGAS-null THP-1 macrophages, demonstrating that the
  remainder of the DNA-stimulated IFN-I pathway remains intact. Fold induction at
  given time point is calculated by normalizing the results to that at the 0 time
  point. Shown is the average of duplicate (technical replicate) from samples at the
  given time point and a representative from two independent experiments.
