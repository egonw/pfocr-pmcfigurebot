caption: In vivo measurement of canonical Wnt signaling activity throughout hematopoietic
  development. Activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway was measured by FACS
  using steady-state Axin2-mTurquoise2 reporter mice. Quantification of the frequency
  of mTurquoise2 (A,B) and the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the mTurquoise2
  populations of heterozygous Axin2-mTurquoise2 (Tg/wt) (C,D) and homozygous Axin2-mTurquoise2
  mice (Tg/Tg) (E,F) for each subset in the bone marrow (A,C,E) and in the thymus
  (B,D,F). Littermate mice not carrying the reporter transgene (Axin2-mTurquoise2
  wild type) were used to define the mTurquoise2 negative population. Data represent
  results for five heterozygous Axin2-mTurquoise2 mice (Tg/wt) and four homozygous
  Axin2-mTurquoise2 mice (Tg/Tg) from two independent experiments. Data bars represent
  median values. Error bars represent minimum and maximum values. * p < 0.033 and
  *** p < 0.001 (ANOVA test).
