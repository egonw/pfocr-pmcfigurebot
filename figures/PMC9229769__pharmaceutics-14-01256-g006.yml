caption: 'Effect of WA on upstream Akt-ERK1/2 and downstream mediators of the NF-kB-mediated
  signaling pathway in LPS-stimulated macrophages. (A) Protein expression and phosphorylation
  status by immunoblotting of Akt, ERK1/2, Cox-2, and iNOS of LPS (1 μg/mL)-stimulated
  peritoneal macrophages exposed to varying doses of WA, along with the BMS (0.05
  μM), LPS-stimulated, and untreated control groups, after 48 h. (B) The histogram
  represents the fold changes in protein expression as determined by densitometry
  of Akt, ERK1/2, Cox-2, and iNOS of LPS (1 μg/mL)-stimulated peritoneal macrophages
  exposed to varying doses of WA, along with the BMS (0.05 μM), LPS-stimulated, and
  untreated control groups, after 48 h. Experimental data are presented as the mean
  ± SEM of three or more independent experiments. * p ≤ 0.05 (comparison vs. LPS only),
  # p ≤ 0.05, and ## p ≤ 0.01 (comparison vs. +LPS) are statistically significant.'
