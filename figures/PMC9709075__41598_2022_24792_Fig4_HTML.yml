caption: 'Infection with IAV leads to the broad upregulation of genes in primary human
  lung cells and in whole lung tissue. (A) A set of 302 genes is shared as a common
  response between all cell types, which is strongly enriched in IRF-responsive genes.
  Genes that were not regulated in response to IAV served as reference matrix. (B–E)
  Sets of IFN target genes as inferred by Ingenuity pathway analysis (IFNγ, n = 139;
  IFNλ1, n = 64; IFNα, n = 128; IFNβ, n = 41) show a significantly stronger average
  induction upon viral infection in AECII compared to AM and lung as determined by
  ANOVA with tukey correction for multiple testing. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 versus AM
  #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01 vs. human lung.'
article_title: Transcriptomic comparison of primary human lung cells with lung tissue
  samples and the human A549 lung cell line highlights cell type specific responses
  during infections with influenza A virus.
