caption: Schematic model for role of FoxO1 in oxidative injury. The SIRT1-mediated
  deacetylation and activation of FoxO1 can promote the synthesis of antioxidants
  including catalase and SOD. After stroke, the anti-oxidation pathway mediated by
  SIRT1 is inhibited. This may further lead to the increasing of oxidative stress.
  The solid line represents the pathway that occurs after stroke, and the dotted line
  represents the pathway suppressed after stroke.
