caption: Effect of inhibition of expression of APT1 on downstream signaling pathways
  and inflammatory factors. (A), p-MEK protein expression level; (B), p-ERK protein
  expression level; (C–E), three inflammatory factor RNA expression levels. The results
  are shown by mean ± standard deviation; the above experiments were repeated three
  times; * represents p < 0.05.
