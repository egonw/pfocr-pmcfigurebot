caption: lncRNA HHIP-AS1 inhibits osteogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs by inhibiting
  Hedgehog signaling pathway. (A) Functional annotation of BM-MSCs lncRNAs at days
  0, 7, and 14 of osteogenic differentiation by GO enrichment analysis based on the
  data obtained from Microarray analysis. (B, C) Volcano plot of the up-regulated
  lncRNAs (Red) and down-regulated lncRNAs (Green). (D) Protein expression of HHIP,
  Gli1, Gli2, RUNX2, and osteocalcin in BM-MSCs transfected with HHIP-AS1 or si-HHIP
  and treated with PF-5274857. (E) ALP and (F) alizarin red staining after 14 days
  of osteogenic induction of BM-MSCs. The histogram data for each group are the average
  of three independent replicates; bars represent standard deviation; ***P < 0.001.
