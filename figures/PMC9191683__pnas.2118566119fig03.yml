caption: PtsI participates in phenol- and ciprofloxacin-mediated killing via early
  steps of the PTS phosphorelay and a subsequent interaction with the cAMP-Crp transcription
  regulatory axis. (A and B) Protective effect of dimethyl-2-oxoglutarate (dm2OG)
  on phenol- or ciprofloxacin-mediated killing. Wild-type E. coli (WT) was pretreated
  with 1 mg/mL dm2OG for 40 min before treatment with 3.5 mg/mL phenol (A) or 5× MIC
  ciprofloxacin (B) for the indicated times. As a reference, in A the ΔptsI mutant
  received no dm2OG pretreatment. (C–H) Protection due to abolished phosphorylation
  site in PtsI, PtsH, or Crr. Wild-type, a ptsI (H189Q) mutant (C and D), a ptsH (H15Q)
  mutant (E and F), and a crr (H91Q) mutant (G and H) were treated with 3.5 mg/mL
  phenol (C, E and G) or 5× MIC ciprofloxacin (D, F, and H) for the indicated times.
  (I) Suppression of stress-induced intracellular cAMP production by ΔptsI. Exponentially
  growing wild-type and ΔptsI mutant cells were treated with 3.5 mg/mL phenol or 5×
  MIC ciprofloxacin for the indicated times after which intracellular cAMP levels
  were determined. (J–L) Suppression of ptsI-mediated protection by exogenous cAMP.
  Wild-type and ΔptsI cells were pretreated with 8 mM cAMP for 15 min before addition
  of phenol (J) at 3.5 mg/mL or ciprofloxacin (K) at 5× MIC. L shows the concentration
  dependence of cAMP-mediated suppression of killing by 5× MIC ciprofloxacin with
  the ΔptsI mutant. (M and N) Deficiency of cyaA protects from phenol- and ciprofloxacin-mediated
  killing. Cultures of wild-type and ΔcyaA mutant cells were treated with 3.5 mg/mL
  phenol (M) or 10× MIC ciprofloxacin (N) for the indicated times. Complementation
  was observed with a plasmid-borne wild-type cyaA. (O and P) Suppression of the protective
  effect of ΔptsI by crp*. Exponentially growing cultures of wild-type, ΔptsI, crp*,
  and ΔptsI-crp* double-mutant cells were treated with 3.5 mg/mL phenol (O) or 5×
  MIC ciprofloxacin (P) for the indicted times. Data indicate average of three biological
  replicates; error bars indicate SEM. See SI Appendix, Fig. S4 and Tables S1 and
  S3 for supporting information.
