caption: Schematic diagram of the physiological systems involved in drug delivery
  from the nasal cavity to the brain. The olfactory pathway (A), the respiratory pathway
  (B), the systemic pathway through the BBB (C), and NALT (D) are presented as possible
  pathways for nasal-brain drug delivery. BBB and NALT are blood–brain-barrier and
  nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue, respectively. In A, a–c represent transcellular
  (through olfactory epithelial cells), paracellular (through olfactory epithelial
  cells), and olfactory nerve pathways, respectively. The black dotted arrows in A,
  B, and D indicate direct drug delivery routes from the nasal cavity to the brain.
  The blue dotted arrows in B–D indicate indirect drug delivery pathways from the
  nasal cavity to the brain
