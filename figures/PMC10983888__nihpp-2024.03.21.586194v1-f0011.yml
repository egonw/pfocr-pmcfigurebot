figure_title: Metabolic phenotype of male PTER-KO mice on a chronic treadmill exercise
  training protocol. Related to
caption: (a-c) Running distance (a), running time (b) and maximum speed (c) of 10-
  to 11-week-old male PTER-KO mice (N=10, blue line and box) or WT mice (N=9, orange
  line and box) following a single bout of treadmill exercise running until exhaustion.(d-l)
  Change in body weight (d), body weight (e), cumulative food intake (f), glucose
  tolerance test (g), insulin tolerance test (h), tissues weights (i), representative
  adipose tissues (j), plasma taurine levels (k), and plasma N-acetyltaurine levels
  (l) of 10- to 11-week-old male PTER-KO mice (N=10, blue line and box) or WT mice
  (N=8, orange line and box) after a 6-week treadmill exercise training protocol (see
  ).Data are shown as mean ± SEM. In (a-c) and (i-l), P-values were calculated from
  two-tailed unpaired t-tests. In (d-h), P-values were calculated from two-way ANOVA
  with post hoc Sidak’s multiple comparisons test.
