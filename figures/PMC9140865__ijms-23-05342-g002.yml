caption: 'Pressure loading results in increased expression of DNA repair proteins
  and cell-cycle arrest in hepatocytes: (A) DNA repair proteins in hepatocytes were
  examined with Western blot and quantification data of the expression levels of γ-H2AX
  and 53BP. The cells were exposed to pressure for 48 h; (B) cell-cycle distribution
  was analyzed using flow cytometry following pressure loading for 48 h. The images
  are representative of three independent experiments. The stacked bar graph indicates
  the percentage of cells at various stages of the cell cycle. Data are expressed
  as the mean ± SD. n = 3, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.'
