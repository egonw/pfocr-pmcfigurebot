caption: 'Comparison of the hippocampal cholinergic response to LPS in early and delayed
  cohorts. There were no significant differences in the cholinergic response to LPS
  between early and delayed cohorts of vehicle-treated non-stressed controls (Vehicle-NSC;
  Panel A) or vehicle-treated rats subjected to repeated restraint stress (Vehicle-RRS;
  Panel B). Panel C: In rats with a history of PB treatment, the cholinergic response
  to LPS was significantly higher in the delayed cohort at collection 8 compared to
  the PB-NSC early cohort. Panel D: In rats with a history of PB treatment and RRS,
  the cholinergic response to LPS was significantly higher in the delayed cohort at
  collections, 9, 11 and 13 compared to the PB-RRS early cohort. All data are expressed
  as mean + SEM, n = 6–10. [*: Significant difference between early and delayed cohorts,
  p < 0.05].'
