caption: Behavioral changes in rats after IoN-CCI model. (A) Changes of mechanical
  allodynia thresholds in response to the mechanical stimuli in the area of rats’
  whisker pads. (B) Changes of thermal withdrawal latencies in the area of rats’ right
  whisker pads after gradient doses of Syb-prII-1 treatment in rats. (C) Changes of
  scores of spontaneous asymmetrical facial grooming on the rats’ right whisker pads
  caused by Syb-prII-1 and morphine. All data were presented as mean ± SEM. n = 12.
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 compared with model group. (D) Histological
  examination of trigeminal neural ganglion from ipsilateral and contralateral sides
  in every group (×400, HE staining).
