caption: Alizarin inhibits NF-κB activation and TNF-α-induced nuclear translocation
  of NF-κB in pancreatic cancer cells. A. Gene chip was used to screen the differentially
  expressed genes of PANC-1 after incubated with alizarin (0,10 μM) for 48 h. B. The
  KEGG pathway was applied to analyze the significantly changed signaling pathways
  in PANC-1 treated with alizarin. C-E. Immunohistochemistry of p65 in tumor tissues
  of 50 patients. The results were observed under a microscope (× 400). F. NF-κB reporter
  assay for 293T cells treated with alizarin. The Renilla luciferase control vector
  was co-expressed with the NF-κB reporter luciferase construct in 293T cells. 293T
  cells were incubated with alizarin (10μM) for 24 hours followed by treatment with
  or without TNF-α (10 ng/mL), and luciferase activity was measured and normalized
  by use of a dual luciferase reporter assay. G. Immunofluorescence staining of NF-κB
  p65 in 293T cells after treatment with the indicated alizarin (10, 20 μM) for 48
  h, followed by stimulation with or without TNF-α (10 ng/mL). Blue indicated nuclei
  stained with DAPI and green signaling represented p65 staining. Scale bar, 200 μm.
  H. Thermo Scientifific ArrayScan VTI HCS software was applied to analyze the cytoplasmic-nuclear
  translocatio of NF-κB p65. *P <0.05, **P <0.01, ***P < 0.001.
