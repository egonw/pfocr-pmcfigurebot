caption: Blocking effect of three T-CMs on cell cycle of liver cancer cells. A, B,
  HepG2 cells were treated with three T-CMs at concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mg/mL
  for 48 h, respectively, and treated with 0.0 mg/mL as control group (CG). Each set
  of samples was tested by flow cytometry and the ratio of each cell cycle was obtained
  using ModFit LT software. GraphPad Prism 7.0 software was used to calculate cell
  cycle distribution. C, D, Results of flow cycle detection and cell cycle distribution
  of Bel7402 cells treated with three T-CMs. Each result was expressed by Mean ± SD
  with four replicates and the lower case letters indicated P < 0.05.
