caption: Inactivated Rap1 signaling pathway attenuates BC cell proliferation, metastasis,
  and chemoresistance. (a) Western blot analysis of Rap1-GTP and total Rap1 in the
  MCF-7/ADR cells treated with ESI-09 and MCF-7/S cells treated with 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP.
  (b) CCK-8 detection of the viability of MCF-7/ADR cells treated with ESI-09 ± ADR.
  (c) CCK-8 detection of the viability of MCF-7/S cells treated with 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP.
  (d) Scratch assay of migration of MCF-7/ADR cells treated with ESI-09 ± ADR. (e)
  Scratch assay of migration of MCF-7/S cells treated with 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP. (f)
  Transwell assay detection of invasion of MCF-7/ADR cells treated with ESI-09 ± ADR.
  (g) Transwell assay detection of invasion of MCF-7/S cells treated with 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP.
  ∗p < 0.05, compared with MCF-7/ADR or MCF-7/S treated with DMSO + ADR. Data are
  shown as mean ± standard deviation of three technical replicates.
