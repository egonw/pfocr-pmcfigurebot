caption: SS-mediated anti-CRC effect acts mainly through class I HDAC-induced P53
  acetylation. (A) Images of the effect of different concentrations of Ent on the
  viability of SW620 cells and colony formation. (B) Flow cytometry analysis to determine
  the cycle of SW620 cells after treatment for 24 h. Western blot analysis of the
  expression levels of CDK2 and p21 in SW620 cells after 24 h of post-administration
  culture. (C) Flow cytometry analysis to determine the apoptosis of SW620 cells after
  24 h of post-administration culture. Western blot analysis of the expression levels
  of cleave Caspase-3, Bcl2 and Cyt C in SW620 cells after 24 h of post-administration.
  (D) Western blot analysis of histone H3K27, H3K18, H3K9 and H4 acetylation as well
  as the expression levels of p53 acetylation and total p53 content in SW620 cells.
  The above experiments were grouped according to blank group, SS group (40 μM), Ent
  group (15 μM), SS (40 μM) + Ent (15 μM) group, and all experiments were performed
  three times independently. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
