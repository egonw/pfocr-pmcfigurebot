caption: 'RACGAP1 stabilizes EZH2 protein expression in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway
  and affects NED in prostate cancer by regulating EZH2. (A) PC3 and DU145 cells were
  treated with FLAG-RACGAP1 for 48 h. Total cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation
  with EZH2 antibody and blotted with an anti-ubiquitin antibody. (B) 293T cells were
  co-transfected with GFP-EZH2, Myc-ubi, and different doses of FLAG-RACGAP1 (0, 2,
  4 µg) for 48 h. Total cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with a
  GFP antibody and blotted with an anti-Myc antibody. (C) PC3 cells were transfected
  for rescue experiments, using PC3 cells with an shRACGAP1 plasmid control (shNC)
  and EZH2 expression plasmid control vector (V), cells with the shRACGAP1 plasmid
  (sh1) and EZH2 expression plasmid control vector (V), cells with the shRACGAP1 plasmid
  control (shNC) and EZH2 expression plasmid, and cells with the shRACGAP1 plasmid
  (sh1) and EZH2 expression plasmid. Western blotting was used to detect proteins
  using the indicated antibodies. We transfected PC3 and DU145 cell lines for rescue
  experiments, using cells with the RACGAP1 expression lentivirus control vector (V)
  and shEZH2 control (shNC), cells with the RACGAP1 expression lentivirus (RA) and
  shEZH2 control (shNC), cells with the RACGAP1 expression lentivirus control vector
  (V) and shEZH2, and cells with the RACGAP1 expression lentivirus (RA) and shEZH2.
  (D) Western blotting was used to detect proteins using the indicated antibodies.
  (E) Transwell assay for indicated PC3 cells (magnification: 100×). Bar graphs showing
  the statistical analysis of three independent experiments. ***, p < 0.001, **, p
  < 0.01, *, p < 0.05, p = ns (no significance); t test for two groups or ANOVA for
  more than two groups.'
