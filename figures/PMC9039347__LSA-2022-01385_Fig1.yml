figure_title: Effect of elevated O-GlcNAcylation on transcriptome during embryonic
  cortical neurogenesis
caption: (A) Human embryonic stem cells (H9) were differentiated into cortical neurons
  using dual SMAD inhibition protocol in DMEM/F12 media with knockout serum replacement
  (KSR) containing LDN-193189 (BMP signalling inhibitor) and SB-431542 (TGF-β Receptor
  Kinase inhibitor) and treated with ThiametG or DMSO as control. The cells were immunostained
  for stage-specific markers, OCT4 (pluripotency), PAX6 (neural stem cell), and β-TUBULIN
  III (early-born neuron), collected on days 0, 12, 30, and 70 of differentiation
  and processed for RNA-Seq (two biological replicates). (B) Hierarchical clustering
  analysis and corresponding heat map of differentially expressed genes in control
  and ThiametG (TMG) treated cells from four stages of neural differentiation. Hierarchical
  clustering was performed using Euclidean distance to visualize the expression of
  genes across groups that were significant in at least one inter-stage comparison
  with false discovery rate < 5%. (C) Number of genes up/down-regulated in TMG-treated
  cells compared to control with different P-values and false discovery rate. (D)
  Venn diagram of the number of genes that are significantly affected (P-value ≤ 0.5)
  due to increased O-GlcNAc levels from four-stages of neural differentiation. (E)
  Ingenuity pathway analysis was performed on the list of genes significantly affected
  (P-value < 0.5) in TMG-treated cells compared to control on D12, D30, and D70 of
  neural differentiation. The red colour indicates activated pathways, and the blue
  colour indicates inhibited pathways. (F) GAD disease association on the list of
  genes affected significantly (≥2-fold with P-value ≤ 0.5) in TMG-treated cells compared
  with controls on D12, D30, and D70 of neural differentiation.
