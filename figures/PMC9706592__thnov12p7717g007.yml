caption: 'Blocking MARCH1 in DCs prevents the Rs-compromised SIT effects on regulating
  eosinophil (Eo) infiltration of the lung. AMCs were prepared with the lung tissues
  collected from mice described in Fig. . A, gated FCM histograms show eosinophil
  counts in BALF. B, boxplots show median (IQR) of eosinophil counts of 6 mice per
  group. Statistics: ANOVA + Bonferroni test. P values are presented in boxplots.
  Abbreviations: DC: Dendritic cell. Rs: Restraint stress. SIT: Specific allergen
  immunotherapy. OVA: Ovalbumin. AAD: Airway allergic disorder. FCM: Flow cytometry.
  WT: Wild type mice. KO: MARCH1âˆ†DC mice (mice carrying MARCH1-deficient DCs). AMC:
  Airway mononuclear cell. EMBP: Eosinophil major basic protein.'
