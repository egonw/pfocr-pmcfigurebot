caption: Anti-inflammatory signaling effects of ethanol extracts from Chrysanthemum
  zawadskii flowers. RAW 264.7 cells were treated with the indicated amounts of ethanol
  extract with or without 0.1 μg/ml of LPS for 30 min. (a) The nuclear translocation
  of NF-κB subunit p65 was assessed using immunofluorescence. (b) Nuclei were counterstained
  with DAPI, and positive staining for p65 was quantified and graphed. Scale bar,
  10 μm.
