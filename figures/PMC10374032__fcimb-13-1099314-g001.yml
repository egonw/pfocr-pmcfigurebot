caption: C. acnes metabolic network of iCA843. C. acnes GEM includes central carbon
  metabolic pathways and amino acid biosynthesis pathways, in addition to characteristic
  pathways, such as the Wood-Werkman cycle, the SCFAs fermentation pathways, the porphyrin
  and vitamin B12 biosynthesis pathways, as well as skin condition related TAG lipase
  reaction and glycerol uptake pathway.
