caption: Schematic overview of the molecular signaling pathways in the FXS. (A) In
  physiological conditions, the glutamatergic pathway is activated upon binding of
  glutamate to the mGluR5 which is located on the postsynaptic cell membrane. A network
  of protein kinases and phosphatases, with their downstream signaling targets, either
  becomes activated or inhibited due to phosphorylation, thus regulating the activity
  of FMRP. Phosphorylation of FMRP results in the release of the bound mRNAs, causing
  protein translation. (B) Loss of FMRP causes a broad-range kinomic deregulation
  which results in a stronger phosphorylation of several protein kinase substrates,
  e.g., the GABAergic pathway is affected by loss of FMRP, because it stabilizes mRNAs
  of several subunits of the GABAA receptor. Loss of FMRP also causes translational
  imbalance with an increased synthesis of proteins such as Calcium/Calmodulin Dependent
  Protein Kinase II Alpha (αCaMKII), Matrix Metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), Microtubule
  Associated Protein 1B (MAP1B), postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), Glycogen
  Synthase Kinase 3 Beta (GSKβ), and Activity Regulated Cytoskeleton Associated Protein
  (Arc).
