caption: Rapamycin prevents CTX-induced primordial follicle loss and apoptosis of
  developing follicles via the mTOR signaling pathway. (a, b and d) The ovaries of
  the CTX-treated group show a significant reduction in the number of primordial follicles
  when compared with the control group. In mice treated with rapamycin alone, the
  number of primordial follicles is significantly increased when compared with the
  control group. Compared with the CTX-treated group, rapamycin treatment increases
  the number of primordial follicles. These results are in line with the ovarian expression
  of DDX4/MVH. Red arrows mark the primordial follicles. (c) TUNEL-positive cells
  appear widespread in large developing follicles in the CTX-treated group. Few TUNEL-positive
  follicle cells can be observed in sections from the control, rapamycin-treated and
  rapamycin intervention groups. (e) APAF-1 and cleaved caspase-3 levels are notably
  elevated after CTX treatment, with no change in the total caspase-3 levels. Rapamycin
  pretreatment could neutralize changes in APAF-1 and cleaved caspase-3. (f) CTX treatment
  significantly increases mTOR pathway activation, as determined by phosphorylation
  of mTOR, p70S6K, rpS6, and eIF4B, compared with the untreated control group. Rapamycin
  pretreatment attenuates the increased phosphorylation of mTOR and its downstream
  molecules. Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). * P <
  0.05, ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001. Scale bar = 50 μm. CC, control group; RC, rapamycin-treated
  group, 5 mg/kg rapamycin for 30 days; MC, CTX-treated group, a single dose of 120
  mg/kg CTX at day 24; RM, rapamycin intervention group, 5 mg/kg rapamycin for 30
  days with a single dose of 120 mg/kg CTX at day 24. CTX, cyclophosphamide.
