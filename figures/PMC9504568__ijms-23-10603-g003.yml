caption: Effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on inflammatory cytokine expression in PEDV-infected
  IPEC-J2 cells (A) and 3D4/21 cells (B) at 24 h post-infection. Sub-confluent cells
  were incubated with 1,25(OH)2D3 (20 nM) for 24 h, after which the cells were infected
  with PEDV (1 MOI). After 1 h of absorption, the cells were washed with PBS and cultured
  with 1,25(OH)2D3 (20 nM) for further 24 h. Then, the cells were collected for RT-qPCR
  and Western blotting analysis. * p < 0.05.
