caption: (A) Targets of curcumin significantly related Aβ, tau, or Aβ and tau. (B)
  PPI networks of targets of curcumin-related Aβ and tau pathology. (C) The top 10
  core targets from the PPI network were ranked by degree. (D) Targets correlated
  Alzheimer disease pathway. (E) GO enrichment analysis of targets of curcumin-related
  Aβ and tau pathology. (F) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of targets of curcumin-related
  Aβ and tau pathology. GO = gene ontology, KEGG = kyoto encyclopedia of genes and
  genomes, PPI = protein-protein interaction.
