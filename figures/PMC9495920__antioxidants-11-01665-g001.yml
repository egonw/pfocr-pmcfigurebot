caption: Extent of injury following a C2 spinal cord hemi-section. (A) Representation
  of a transversal view of the C2 spinal cord and representative extent of injury
  for each group in gray, i.e., at 1 h post-injury (P.I.), 1 day P.I., 3 days P.I.,
  and 7 days P.I. (B) Extent of injury quantification in percentage compared with
  100% uninjured hemi-spinal cord. The quantification has been made only in the ventral
  part where the phrenic motoneurons are located. There was no difference between
  the different groups (one-way ANOVA, p = 0.277).
