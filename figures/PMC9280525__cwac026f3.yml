caption: Derived N-glycosylation traits. A) N-glycans can be divided into four types,
  representing their maturation throughout the biosynthetic pathway. B) Per N-glycosylation
  type, different traits can be calculated as shown here for complex type N-glycans
  (including their common abbreviations). The calculation of derived glycosylation
  traits allows the representation of basic glycan biosynthesis steps and enhances
  data precision.
