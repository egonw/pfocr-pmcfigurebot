caption: 'VMP1 regulates apoptosis of goat myoblasts: (A,B) Expression levels of apoptosis-related
  genes (caspase-3, caspase-9, and beclin-1) were quantified by RT-qPCR in myoblasts
  overexpressing and underexpressing VMP1. (C,D) Western blot analysis illustrates
  the levels of beclin-1 and caspase-3 cleavage in myoblasts overexpressing and underexpressing
  VMP1. GAPDH was used as the internal standard. (E) Apoptotic myoblasts were identified
  by flow cytometry. Cells were stained with annexin V–FITC/propidium iodide (PI).
  (F) Percentages of myoblasts in apoptosis. (G) Apoptotic myoblasts identified by
  flow cytometry. (H) Percentages of myoblasts in apoptosis. Replicates = 3. Data
  are presented as means ± SE; * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01. NC, negative control.'
