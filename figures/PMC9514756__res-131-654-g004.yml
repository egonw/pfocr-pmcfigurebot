caption: 'Multinucleated giant cells display a specific transcriptional regulatory
  network. A, Dot plot of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment
  analysis based on cell type–specific marker genes showing top pathways upregulated
  in myeloid subclusters other than resident macrophages. P values were calculated
  by hypergeometric distribution using R package ClusterProfiler. Detailed P values
  were provided in Table S4. B, KEGG pathway enrichment showing significant enrichment
  pathways for giant cells (red font) compared to other nonresident myeloid cells
  (black font). P values calculated by hypergeometric distribution using R package
  ClusterProfiler. C, Binary heatmap generated from the binary activities of the TF
  (transcription factor) regulons for myeloid cells, with black blocks representing
  cells that are on (with activated TF regulon). The identity of cell type was assigned
  by established cluster information in single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq)
  data. Red boxes highlight the specific and activated TF regulons in giant cells.
  Top bars show the cell type information, the number of genes and unique molecular
  identifiers. D, Four specific regulons in giant cells are highlighted: ARID5B (AT-rich
  interactive domain-containing protein 5B), MITF (microphthalmia-associated transcription
  factor), TFEC (transcription factor EC), and NR1H3 (liver X receptor alpha). For
  each TF identified, the specific motif along with the promotor binding motif (left),
  the RNA expression values of that TF (middle), and the cells passed the binary threshold
  set in the AUC histogram (right) are shown. E, A network generated with iRegulon
  using ARID5B, MITF, TFEC, and NR1H3 target genes identified by Single-Cell Regulatory
  Network Inference and Clustering (SCENIC) as an input. The nodes, representing the
  TF regulons sized by the number of their motifs. The edges, representing the connections
  between each of the 5 TFs, and their target genes and shown as a line colored based
  on the TFs. Input target genes shown in the network are identified as marker genes
  for giant cells in snRNA-seq analysis. F, Z score normalized mean expression of
  6 genes identified in digital spatial profiler analysis (Figure ). Color scale denotes
  log2FC of gene expression. ALCAM, activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule; ARID5B,
