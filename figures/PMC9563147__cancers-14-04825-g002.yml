caption: TCI result analysis for HNSCC patients. (a) Reactome pathway enrichment analysis
  of 903 TCI DEGs. Top 20 pathways with highest adjusted p values are listed. (b)
  104 gene from 59 enriched Reactome pathways can be separated into 2 groups based
  on their expression profile. Forty-seven genes in the upper part are more associated
  with collagen biosynthesis processes with TP53, CDKN2A, TTN, EGFR and LRB1P as their
  major drivers. Fifty-seven genes in the lower part are more associated with cell
  cycle and DNA repair processes with TP53, RB1, CSMD3, SYNE1 and LRB1P as their major
  drivers; (c) Driver and DEG causal relationship network. Each yellow node represents
  a TCI driver and each green node represents a DEG. Each red line represent a driver
  → DEG activating causal interaction and each blue line represents a repressing driver
  → DEG causal interaction.
