figure_title: The HLA-B*46:01 allele influences NK cell activity during HIV disease
  pathogenesis
caption: (A) Sequence alignment of B*46:01 with the parental B*15:01 and C*01:02 alleles.
  The sequences matching HLA-C are shown in red font. Asterisks below the sequences
  represent identical residues, spaces indicate mismatches with C*01:02, while periods
  are mismatches with B*15:01.(B) The crystal structure of HLA-B*46:01 is shown with
  heavy-chain sequence corresponding to B*15 (teal) and to C*01 (blue), as well as
  b2m (gray) and the presented peptide (red). The molecular backbone is shown for
  most residues, with all atoms depicted for HLA residues that contact KIR2DL3 in
  its solved cocrystal structure with HLA-C*07 (). Of these contact residues, three
  within heavy-chain positions 66–76 that correspond to HLA-C residues in HLA-B*46:01
  are annotated in yellow.(C) Pathway enrichment analyses of longitudinal RNA-seq
  samples were performed among people with AHI in the RV217 cohort (n = 7). Genes
  expressed in sorted NK, CD8+ T, CD4+ T, and B cells were ranked based on differential
  expression between B*46+ and B*46− individuals, with the number of enriched pathways
  reported for each genotype at four time points. Statistical significance was determined
  by chi-square test.(D) Relative gene expression of all enriched genes in the significant
  pathways in NK cells when comparing B*46+ versus B*46 people at VL setpoint during
  AHI. The log2-fold change in expression relative to the mean gene expression in
  B*46+ donors is shown.See also  and –.
