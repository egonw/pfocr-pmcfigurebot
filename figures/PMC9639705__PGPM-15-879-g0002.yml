caption: 'Drug-drug, drug-gene, and drug-drug-gene interactions., (A) Normal metabolism:
  expected drug exposure (black dotted line in plasma drug concentration–time curve,
  single exposure) for a drug/substrate that is metabolized by two cytochrome P450
  (CYP) enzymes. (B) Drug–drug interaction (DDI): inhibition (eg null activity) or
  induction (eg increased enzyme copies) of CYP A by co-medications resulting in increased
  (red line in plasma drug concentration–time curve) or decreased (green line in plasma
  drug concentration–time curve) drug exposures, respectively. (C) Drug–gene interaction
  (DGI): genetic variation inactivates/reduces (loss-of-function/LoF variant) or increases
  (gain-of-function/GoF variant) CYP B activity resulting in increased or decreased
  drug exposures, respectively. (D) Drug-drug-gene interaction (DDGI): cumulative
  effects of comedications (DDIs) and genetic variations (DGIs). In a category 1 DDGI,
  a DDI and DGI on the same pathway (eg CYP A) and direction (eg inhibitor with a
  LOF variant) interact to significantly increase (or decrease) drug exposure while
  in a category 2 DDGI, the DDI and DGI act on different pathways but still in the
  same direction to also increase (or decrease) drug exposure. Lastly, category 3
  comprises DDIs and DGIs with opposing effects (eg inhibitor with a GOF variant)
  that leads to increased (inhibitor effects greater than GOF variant effects), decreased
  (inhibitor effects lower than GOF variant effects) or unchanged (inhibitor effects
  similar to GOF variant effects) drug exposure. The above interactions also apply
  to bioactivation of prodrugs (in which decreased metabolism results in decreased
  systemic exposure) and other pathways (eg drug- and/or gene-mediated changes to
  drug transporters or drug targets). If a drug has a comparable clinical effect with
  its metabolites, the effects of metabolism-based DDIs, DGIs and DDGIs may not be
  apparent. Any compensation by CYP A for the loss (or increase) in CYP B’s activity,
  and vice-versa, is not depicted/accounted for in this over-simplified schematic.'
