caption: 'Western blot assay of the levels of target proteins involved in the Wnt/β-catenin
  signalling pathway: (a) TNF-α, IL-17, and β-catenin protein bands. (b) TNF-α, (c)
  IL-17, and (d) β-catenin quantified protein expression levels. The β-actin protein
  was used as an internal reference. Total protein was extracted from synovial cells
  from mice in four groups (normal, normal+stretching exercise, model, and model+stretching
  exercise). Cells in the model and model+stretching exercise groups were treated
  with LiCl or IWR. All experiments were performed in triplicates, and data are representative
  of three independent experiments. Data are presented as means ± SD. Differences
  and comparisons between multiple groups were analysed using one-way ANOVA followed
  by a post hoc test (Tukey''s test). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs.
  control; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, and ###P < 0.001 vs. model; &P < 0.05 and &&P <
  0.01 vs. model+stretching exercise.'
