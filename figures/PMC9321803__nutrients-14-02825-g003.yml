caption: Metabolic programming of human iECs by VB12. (A) PCA plots of metabolite
  features identified by positive and negative ionization in human iECs cultured with
  VB12 or PBS for 2 weeks (n = 3 samples/group). (B) Significant metabolic pathway
  between VB12- and PBS-cultured iECs. (C) Heatmap showing differentially enriched
  metabolites. SAM, S-adenosylmethionine.
