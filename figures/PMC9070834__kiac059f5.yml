caption: Schematic depiction of the GLK-BCM pathway that regulates Chl and LHCP levels
  in response to environmental factors in Arabidopsis. BCM is required for full activation
  of GUN4/5 (Chl synthesis) and destabilization of the SGR protein (repression of
  Chl degradation; ). GLKs control the amount of LHCP (LHCI/LHCII) via direct transcriptional
  regulation of (i) LHCP apoprotein genes and (ii) BCM genes, regulating levels of
  Chl and stabilizing LHCP. During dark-induced leaf senescence, the reduction in
  BCM expression caused by the rapid decrease in GLK expression in response to dark
  treatment is also thought to play a role in the onset of leaf yellowing. Meanwhile,
  expression of BCM2 is upregulated during the late stage of leaf senescence, thereby
  fine-tuning the Chl content.
