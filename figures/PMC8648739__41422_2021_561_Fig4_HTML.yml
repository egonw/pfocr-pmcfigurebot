figure_title: Intestinal lymphocyte deficiency in β7−/− mice suppressed Wnt signaling
  and increased Notch signaling in the ISCs and TA cells
caption: a FACS plots (left) and frequency quantification (right) of GFPhigh and GFPlow
  cells isolated from control mice (Lgr5-GFP) and β7−/− mice (Lgr5-GFP; β7−/−). n = 3
  mice per group, data are represented as means ± SEM, ns, not significant, t-test.
  b Normalized RNA-seq expression values of Wnt and Notch pathway target genes in
  GFPhigh and GFPlow cells from control mice (Lgr5-GFP) and β7−/− mice (Lgr5-GFP;
  β7−/−). n = 5 mice per group, data are represented as means ± SEM, ****P < 0.0001,
  ***P < 0.001, *P < 0.05 (Deseq2 P values). c GSEA of Wnt, Notch pathway and cell
  cycle-associated genes in GFPhigh (top) and GFPlow (bottom) cells (control vs β7−/−).
  The green line shows the enrichment profile. The black bars show where genes from
  a given gene set are located (hit). NES, normalized enrichment score; FDR, false
  discovery rate. FDR < 0.25 was considered as statistically significant. d, e Immunoblot
  analysis (d) and quantification (e) for NICD, β-catenin and active β-catenin in
  the lysates of the small intestinal crypts from WT and β7−/− mice. n = 3 mice per
  group. Data are represented as means ± SEM, *P < 0.05, t-test. f Left, representative
  images of β-catenin staining for crypt sections from WT and β7−/− mice. Nuclear
  β-catenin+ cells are indicated by red arrows. Scale bars, 25 μm. Right, quantification
  of nuclear β-catenin+ cells in each crypt. n = 6 mice per group, more than 8 fields
  per mouse. Data are represented as means ± SEM, *P < 0.05, t-test. g Left, representative
  images of HES1 staining of crypt sections from WT and β7−/− mice. Scale bars, 25 μm.
  Right, quantification of HES1+ cells in each crypt. n = 6 mice per group, more than
  8 fields per mouse. Data are represented as means ± SEM, *P < 0.05, t-test. h Frequency
  of nuclear β-catenin+ (middle) and HES1+ (bottom) cells at each position in the
  small intestinal crypt according to the scheme in the inset (top). n = 4 mice per
  group, more than 30 well-oriented crypts in each mouse were analyzed. Data are represented
  as means ± SEM, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05, ns, no significant difference, t-test.
