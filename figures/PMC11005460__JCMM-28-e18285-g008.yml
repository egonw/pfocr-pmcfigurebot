caption: LCN2 overexpression in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) reverses the engeletin‐mediated
  shift in the M1 and M2 polarization of microglia in CSDS model mice. (A–C) Representative
  western blotting (A) and corresponding quantification (B, C) demonstrating that
  the overexpression of LCN2 reverses engeletin‐related reductions in the M1 polarization
  of microglia (iNOS, CD86). (D–G) Representative western blotting (D) and corresponding
  quantification (E–G) demonstrating that the overexpression of LCN2 reverses the
  engeletin‐induced enhancement of M2 microglial polarization (CD206, Arg1 and BDNF).
  Results are means ± SEM. (n = 5). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001,
  one‐way ANOVAs with Bonferroni post hoc testing. BDNF, brain‐derived neurotrophic
  factor; CSDS, chronic stress social defeat stress.
