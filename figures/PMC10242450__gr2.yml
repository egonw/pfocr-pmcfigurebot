caption: Proteomic and transcriptomic differences in cervicovaginal mucosal and tissue
  samples between vaginal microbiome groups(A) Heatmap showing differentially abundant
  proteins (353, 5% FDR) between vaginal microbiome groups, with functional annotation
  of biological pathways (p < 0.0001) shown on the right, for participant group 1.
  See A for proteomics on participant group 2.(B) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
  of vaginal mucosal proteome differences between microbiome groups for participant
  group 1. See B for pathway analysis of participant group 2.(C) Heatmap of differentially
  expressed genes by transcriptomic analysis of vaginal biopsy samples from a subset
  of 80 women (1,435 genes [<5% FDR]) between vaginal microbiome groups. Functional
  annotated pathways are indicated with major gene clusters.(D) GSEA of differentially
  expressed genes in vaginal tissue between microbiome groups.(E) Heatmap of vaginal
  mucosal metabolites significantly different between vaginal groups (27, 5% family-wise
  error rate).See  for a summary of these interactions. See also , ,  for protein
  and gene expression.
