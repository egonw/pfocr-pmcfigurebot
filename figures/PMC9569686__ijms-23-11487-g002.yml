caption: 'Analysis of the protein levels of different SMAD and key fibrotic markers
  in the heart tissues of male Npr1 gene knockout mice: representative Western blots
  showing the levels of pSMAD-1, pSMAD-2, pSMAD-3, SMAD-4, SMAD-6, α-SMA, pTAK1, and
  pERK 1/2 proteins in the heart tissues of Npr1 mice, respectively (panels (A–H)).
  The densitometry analysis of proteins was normalized to total SMAD proteins and/or
  β-actin protein levels. Values are expressed as means ± S.E. (n = 6 animals in each
  group). Statistical significance is expressed as *** p < 0.001, Npr1+/+ (2-copy)
  vs. Npr1−/− (0-copy). In panels (A–F), Western blot was performed for the cytosolic
  extract and in panels (G,H), whereas Western blot was performed for both cytosolic
  and nuclear extracts.'
