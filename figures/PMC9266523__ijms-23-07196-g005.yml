caption: Impact of the absence of GCN2 on the response of the tibialis anterior (TA)
  muscle to APAP treatment for 18 d. Gcn2 null (Gcn2−/−) or positive mice (Gcn2+/+)
  were fed a diet with 1% APAP (APAP) for 18 d or were pair-fed (PF) the respective
  control diet to match the level of food intake of the APAP-treated mice. (A) Mass
  of the two TA muscles. (B) Cross-sectional area (CSA) of muscle fibers. Scale bar
  = 50 µm. (C) Total free GSH (GSH, GSSG, and other small disulphides) concentration
  in TA muscle. (D) Expression of the ATF4-dependent gene Gadd45. Total RNA extracted
  from the liver was analyzed by reverse transcription RT-qPCR. Each bar shows the
  median with interquartile and dots are individual values. * p ≤ 0.05; ** p ≤ 0.01;
  *** p ≤ 0.001; **** p ≤ 0.001 vs. respective PF; Mann Whitney test.
