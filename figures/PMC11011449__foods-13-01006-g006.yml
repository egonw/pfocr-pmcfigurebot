caption: Volcano plot and KEGG enrichment analysis of intracellular metabolites. (A–C)
  Volcano plot of M17 vs. M17-β, UM17 vs. M17-β, and UM17 vs. M17. The x-axis represents
  the fold change in metabolite expression between the two groups, i.e., log2FC, and
  the y-axis represents the statistical test value of the difference in metabolite
  expression, i.e., −log10(p-value) value. The higher the value, the more significant
  the expression difference. (D–F) KEGG enriched pathways of M17 vs. M17-β, UM17 vs.
  M17-β, and UM17 vs. M17. The x-axis represents the Rich factor, and the y-axis represents
  the KEGG pathway. The size of the bubbles represents the number of compounds enriched
  in the metabolic set in that pathway, and the color of the bubbles indicates the
  size of the p-value for different enrichment significances.
