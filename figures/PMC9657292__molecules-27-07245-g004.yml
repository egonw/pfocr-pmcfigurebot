caption: ACN downregulated Akt/mTOR pathway in 4T1 BC cells. Protein levels of p-Akt
  (A), p-mTOR (B), and RPS6 (C). Cells starved overnight were treated with ACN (IC50)
  in 2.5% FBS supplemented culture for 48 h. Protein levels were determined in cell
  lysates. Akt, p-Akt, and p-mTOR levels were determined by immunoblot analysis with
  primary and secondary antibodies as detailed in materials and methods. Western blots
  are representative of at least two independent experiments (upper panels). Band
  intensities of target proteins determined with ImageJ software were divided by band
  intensity of β-actin, and values were normalized to untreated control (lower panels).
  Protein levels of RPS6 were determined with Millipex MAP magnetic bead assay. The
  RPS6 mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) values of cell lysates were normalized to
  untreated controls. Data from MFI are mean (n = 3) ± SEM. The unpaired t test with
  Welch’s correction was used to determine significance (*** p < 0.001; * p < 0.05).
