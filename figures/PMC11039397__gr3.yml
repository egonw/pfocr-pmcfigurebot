caption: SR 1 attenuates the RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis via inhibiting AhR-c-src-NF-κB/p-ERK
  MAPK-NFATc1 signaling pathway(A) The BMMs were stimulated with the indicated concentrations
  of SR1. The detection of the AhR carried out immunofluorescence, Scale bar, 100 μm.(B)
  BMMs were induced RANKL and stimulated with the indicated concentrations of SR1
  for 4 days. The AhR protein levels in the cytoplasmic and nuclear were evaluated.(C)
  BMMs were planted in a 6-well plate until the cells confluency reaches 90%, treated
  with serum-free medium starvation for 2 h, and then replaced with serum-containing
  medium and pretreated with or without 6 μM SR1 for 2 h. Finally, RANKL was stimulated
  the cells for 0, 15, 30, and 60 min. The cells were lysed with RIPA and the c-src
  and p-c-src protein levels were evaluated.(D) BMMs were planted in a 6-well plate
  until the cells confluency reaches 90%, treated with serum-free medium starvation
  for 2 h, and then replaced with serum-containing medium and pretreated with or without
  6 μM SR1 for 2 h. Finally, the cells were stimulated with or without RANKL for 15 min.
  The cells were lysed with RIPA and the c-src and p-c-src protein levels were evaluated.(E)
  Treatment of BMMs was carried out with RANKL, with or without 6 μM SR1 for 0, 15,
  30, 45, and 60 min. The p-P65, P65, p-ERK, and ERK protein levels were evaluated.(F)
  Quantitative analysis results of p-P65, p-ERK relative to P65, ERK ratios are displayed.
  Data were presented as means ± SEM; n = 3; ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001,
  ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.
