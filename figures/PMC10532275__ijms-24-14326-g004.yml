caption: The activated integrin recruits signal proteins and structural proteins to
  form FA to respond to mechanical stimuli. (A) Without mechanical stimuli, RhoA is
  inactive as RhoA-GDP. (B) Mechanical stimuli activate integrins to initiate FA formation.
  Through FAK-Src complex, RhoA pathway is activated by integrin-mediated mechanical
  stimuli. mDia activated by RhoA promotes the polymerization of G-actin. ROCK activated
  by RhoA promotes the dephosphorylation of MLC and cofilin to stabilize the cytoskeleton.
  Integrin-FA complex reorganizes the actin cytoskeleton and transmits the extracellular
  mechanical signals into cells.
