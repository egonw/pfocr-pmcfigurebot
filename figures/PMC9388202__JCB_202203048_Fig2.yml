caption: 'Vav restrains synaptic growth by downregulating BMP signaling. (A and B)
  Genetic interactions between Vav and BMP pathway components. (A) Confocal images
  of anti-HRP–labeled NMJ 6/7 in third instar larvae of indicated genotypes. Insets
  show magnified views of terminal boutons marked with asterisks. (B) Quantification
  of total bouton number normalized to muscle area and satellite bouton number at
  NMJ 6/7 (n = 15). In some experiments, WT and Vav2/Y mutant larvae were grown on
  medium containing 0.1% DMSO (vehicle alone) or 10 μM jasplakinolide. (C and D) Loss
  of Vav increases levels of P-Mad in motor neurons. (C) Single confocal sections
  of NMJ 6/7 and VNC labeled with anti–P-Mad and anti-HRP (NMJ) or anti-Elav (VNC)
  in WT and Vav2/Y third instar larvae grown on medium containing 0.1% DMSO or 10
  μM jasplakinolide. (D) Quantification of P-Mad intensity normalized to HRP (NMJ)
  or Elav (VNC). n = 18 NMJs or VNCs. (E and F) Loss of Vav increases Myc-Tkv levels
  at the NMJ. (E) Single confocal sections of NMJ 6/7 doubly labeled with anti-Myc
  (red) and anti-HRP (green) shown for C155-GAL4/Y; UAS-Myc-tkv/+ (WT), Vav2,C155-GAL4/Y;
  UAS-Myc-tkv/+ (Vav2/Y), and Vav2,C155-GAL4/Y; UAS-Myc-tkv,UAS-Vav-HA/+ (C155>Vav-HA,
  Vav2/Y) third instar larvae. (F) Quantification of the ratio of Myc-Tkv to HRP intensities.
  n = 18 NMJs. Data represent mean ± SEM. Comparisons are with WT (***, P < 0.001;
  n.s., not significant). Dashed lines represent mean WT or WT+DMSO values. Scale
  bars: 20 μm (A); 5 μm (A, inset); 5 μm (C); 2 μm (E).'
