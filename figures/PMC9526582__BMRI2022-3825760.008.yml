caption: Kaplan-Meier survival curves presenting prognostic relationships between
  high and low expressions of specific genes to disease-free survival (DFS) using
  the GSE41258 database patient samples. (a) FABP1 (b) CD36, (c) IRS1 (d) PCK1, (e)
  THBS1, and (f) TGFB1expressions. Survival curves were plotted using SPSS 22.0. Specific
  differentially expressed gene (DEG) expression levels were selected by the median
  value. Results are visually presented by Kaplan-Meier survival plots, and p values
  were calculated using log-rank statistics. Patient number(n) = 189;p = log‐rank pvalue,
  withp < 0.05considered significant.
