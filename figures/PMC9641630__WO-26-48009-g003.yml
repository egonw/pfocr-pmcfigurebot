caption: 'The effect of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and quercetin (Q) on the apoptosis of
  Caco-2 cells for 48 hours. Dot-plots from flow cytometric illustrating apoptotic
  status in Caco-2 cells. Cells in the upper-left quadrant are necrotic, cells in
  the upper-right quadrant have late apoptosis, the lower-left quadrant shows normal
  living cells, and the cells in the lower-right quadrant are early apoptotic cells(A–E),
  the total percentage of apoptosis in Caco-2 cells treated with the indicated concentrations
  of 5-FU, Q, combination 1 (QFH), and combination 2 (QFL) for 48 hours (F) designated
  as *p < 0.05 vs. control group, #p < 0.05 vs. 5-FU group and Ωp < 0.05 vs. Q group
  and ∆p < 0.05 vs. QFL group'
