caption: 'BMP4 can restore the dysregulated transcriptome and long-termly preserve
  the pluripotency of N/2i-mESCs. (A) Skin (upper) and germline (lower) chimerism
  comparison indicated that BMP4 could sustain the developmental potential of N/2i-mESCs
  during long-term culture. The horizontal axis represented days after transition
  to indicated culture conditions. Three male mESC lines (#S2, #S3, and #S7) were
  tested. Data are represented as the mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was performed
  using a two-tailed unpaired Welch’s t-test. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
  (B) PCA showing the transcriptome difference among S-, S/2i-, N/2i + BMP4-, N/2i-,
  N/a2i- and N/t2i-mESCs. (C) Volcano plot showing the global differentially expressed
  genes between N/2i + BMP4- and N/2i-mESCs. Vertical line indicates expression fold
  change = 2, and horizontal line indicates P-value = 0.01. (D) KEGG pathways enrichment
  analysis of 1,633 upregulated genes caused by BMP4, as indicated in Fig. 5C. Representative
  pathways are shown. (E) Calling of significantly enriched motifs (408) from the
  1,633 upregulated genes caused by BMP4, as indicated in Fig. 5C. Representative
  motifs of Klf and Smad family are shown. (F) GSEA showing the global change of TGFβ
  receptor signaling pathway (left, n = 185), BMP signaling pathway (middle, n = 173)
  and AKT signaling pathway (right, n = 207) in indicated mESCs compared to N/2i-mESCs.
  These gene sets were cited from Gene Ontology Browser on MGI website. NES, normalized
  enrichment score. FDR, false discovery rate'
