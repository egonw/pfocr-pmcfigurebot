caption: 'Peiminine inhibits epithelial mesenchymal transformation (EMT) of endometriosis
  through MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. A: mRNA expression level of MEK1/2, ERK, E-cadherin,
  N-cadherin, Vimentin were analyzed by RT-qPCR; B: Protein blotting images and numeric
  quantification of protein expression level of MEK1/2, ERK, p-ERK, E-cadherin, N-cadherin,
  Vimentin as detected by western blotting. *P<0.05, compared to Sham, **P<0.01, compared
  to Sham; #P<0.05 compared to Model, ##P<0.01 compared to Model; $P<0.05 compared
  to Dienogest, $$P<0.01 compared to Dienogest; &P<0.05 compared to Pei-HD, &&P<0.01
