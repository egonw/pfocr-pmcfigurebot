caption: IFI35 promotes CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity and alleviates exhaustion. A, B Representative
  FACS plots (A) and quantification (B) of IFNγ expression among CD8+ T cells in CT26
  tumor. Two tailed t-tests, *P < 0.05. C, D Representative FACS plots (C) and quantification
  (D) of TNFα expression among CD8+ T cells in CT26 tumor. Two tailed t-tests, *P < 0.05.
  E, F Effect of tumor-secreted IFI35 protein on CD8+ T cell effector cytokines. Activated
  mouse CD8+ T cells were cultured in the presence of supernatant from murine colon
  cancer cells expressing shRNA against IFI35 (shIFI35) and scrambled sequence control
  (shRNA) for 72 h. IFNγ and TNFα of CD8+ T cells were calculated by Flow cytometric
  analysis. n = 3. Error bars represent the mean ± SEM. Two tailed t-tests, ***P < 0.001,
  ****P < 0.0001. G, H Representative FACS plots (G) and quantification (H) of PD1
  expression among CD8+ T cells in CT26 tumor. Two tailed t-tests, *P < 0.05. I, J
  Representative FACS plots (I) and quantification (J) of LAG3 expression among CD8+
  T cells in CT26 tumor. Two tailed t-tests, *P < 0.05. K, L Representative FACS plots
  (K) and quantification (L) of TOX expression among CD8+ T cells in CT26 tumor. Two
  tailed t-tests, *P < 0.05
