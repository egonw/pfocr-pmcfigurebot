  protein and gene expression. (a–c) Quantification of the osteoblast-related proteins
  ALP, Osterix, and RUNX2. (d–f) Cell lysates were subjected to WB analysis with antibodies
  against these proteins. (g–i) Quantification of the mRNA expression of ALP, Osterix,
  and RUNX2. n = 3; ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗vs the NC group; ##P < 0.01, #vs the PC group.'
