caption: 'BC treatment, sequence of treatments and main care pathways, by age at BC
  diagnosis. (A) Distribution of BC treatment. (B) Sequential care pathways. Care
  pathways are displayed from inwards to outwards. For instance, n = 143,042 patients
  received surgery first without chemotherapy. Among those, surgery was followed by
  radiotherapy for n = 114,585 patients and by endocrine therapy without radiotherapy
  for n = 11,889. Treatment sequences are displayed in the following order: neoadjuvant
  chemotherapy (NAC)-neoadjuvant targeted therapy (NTT)-neoadjuvant radiotherapy (NRT)-neoadjuvant
  endocrine therapy (NET)-surgery-adjuvant chemotherapy–adjuvant targeted therapy–adjuvant
  radiotherapy–adjuvant endocrine therapy. The continuation of NET or NTT after surgery
  is not considered to constitute adjuvant endocrine therapy or adjuvant targeted
  therapy; (C) Distribution of the four main care pathways extracted from (B): (i)
  surgery without chemotherapy, (ii) surgery followed by chemotherapy, (iii) neoadjuvant
  chemotherapy (NAC), (iv) neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET). For the sake of clarity,
  radiotherapy is not spelled out in trajectories. The vast majority of the patients
  in the cohort (85.3%) underwent radiotherapy as part of their care pathway. Patients
  with neoadjuvant chemotherapy are classified as NAC irrespective of their NRT/NET
  status. Patients with NRT and NET are classified as NRT (n = 166). This category
  is so rare that it is not displayed on the plot. As a consequence, the patients
  in the NET group received neoadjuvant endocrine therapy and neither NRT nor NAC.
  Targeted therapy is always given in combination with either chemotherapy or endocrine
  therapy. This implies that NTT patients are in the NAC, NRT, or NET group. Raw data
  for subgroups representing less than 2% of the total population are not displayed
  on the graph, to ensure readability: 2169 (0.9%) patients are in the NET group;
  (D) Distribution of the four main treatment trajectories extracted from (B) per
  age class at BC diagnosis. Raw data for subgroups representing less than 2% of the
  corresponding age class are not displayed on the graph, to ensure readability. The
  values per age class are: for the <30 year-old group: n < 10; 30–39 years old: n
  = 25 (0.2%); 40–49 years old: n = 92 (0.2%); 50–59 years old: n = 207 (0.3%); 60–69
  years old: n = 355 (0.6%); and 70–79 years old: n = 610 (1.6%) for the NET group.
  For the ≥80 years age class: n = 215 (1.1%) for the NAC group. Abbreviations: BC
  = breast cancer; CT = chemotherapy; NAC = neoadjuvant chemotherapy; NET = neoadjuvant
  endocrine therapy; NTT = neoadjuvant targeted therapy; and NRT = neoadjuvant radiotherapy.'
