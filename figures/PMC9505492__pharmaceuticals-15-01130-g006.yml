caption: 'Lactobacillus rhamnosus JYLR-005 alleviates HRZE-induced liver injury. (a)
  Representative images of liver parenchyma H&E staining in each group, arrows mean
  inflammatory cell infiltration and lipid vacuoles; (b)ALT, (c)AST and (d) AKP levels
  of serum; (e) GSH, (f) SOD, and (g) TBARS (represents MDA level) levels of liver
  tissue homogenate in each group. The data are presented as the means ± SEM (n =
  6 per group). The HRZE + JYLR-005 group and the HRZE + MgIG group shared the control
  group and the HRZE group. Compared with the control group: * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001,
  and **** p < 0.0001. Compared with the HRZE group: #p < 0.05.'
