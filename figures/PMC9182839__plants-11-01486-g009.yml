caption: 'Effect of Damiana leaves extract on protein expression of phosphorylated
  MAPK signaling pathway on UVB-irradiated HaCaT (A,B) and HDF (C,D) cells. Data are
  presented as the mean ± SD. # and * indicate significant differences from the non-irradiated
  control and UVB-treated groups, respectively. #, ## and ###p < 0.05, 0.01 and 0.001
  vs. the non-treated group. *, ** and *** p < 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001 vs. the UVB-treated
  control, respectively.'
