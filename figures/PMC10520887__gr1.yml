caption: pIKKε positively regulates pSTING-induced type I IFN response.A–C, the pIKKε−/−
  3D4/21 cells, pTBK1−/−3D4/21 cells, pTBK1−/−/pIKKε−/−3D4/21 cells, and control 3D4/21 cells
  in 24-well plates (3 × 105 cells/well) were transfected with 2′3′-cGAMP (2 μg/ml)
  by using Lipofectamine 2000 for 0 to 12 h, respectively. The harvested cells were
  measured by RT–qPCR for downstream gene expressions. D–F, pIKKε−/− 3D4/21 cells
  (D), pTBK1−/− 3D4/21 cells (E), pIKKε−/−pTBK1−/− 3D4/21 cells (F), and 3D4/21 cells
  in 24-well plate (3 × 105 cells/well) were transfected with 2′3′-cGAMP (1 and 2 μg/ml)
  for 8 h. The harvested cells were detected by Western blotting with the indicated
  antibodies. IFN, interferon; pIKKε, porcine IKKε; qPCR, quantitative PCR; STING,
  stimulator of IFN genes.
