caption: 'p68: a crucial switch for the major signaling pathways and crosstalks. In
  the signaling crosstalk between the four major pathways namely EGFR pathway, Wnt
  pathway, NF-κB pathway and Notch pathway, p68 plays a crucial role as a connecting
  link between these pathways and helping in the switch from one pathway to another.
  Due to this, the downstream target genes get activated and thereafter mediate the
  progression of cancer through their physiological functions. This highlights the
  effective role played by p68 in being the unique common player that helps in regulating
  the factors like p38 MAP kinase, Stat3, Akt, β-catenin and MAML1 involved in the
  major signaling axis.'
