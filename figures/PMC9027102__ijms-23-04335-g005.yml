caption: VEGF signaling through the Akt/eNOS pathway in primary endothelial cells.
  Primary heart endothelial cells were treated with VEGF-A for 5 min, as in the legend
  of . (A) Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation (Ip) with α-SHP2 antibody
  followed by immunoblotting (Ib) with antibodies against phospho-CEACAM1 (α-pCC1),
  CEACAM1 (α-CC1), and α-SHP2 to detect these proteins in the α-SHP2 immunopellet.
  (B) Lysates were immunoprecipitated with the α-VEGFR2 antibody followed by immunoblotting
  with antibodies against α-SHP2, phospho-VEGFR2, and VEGFR2 to assess the level of
  these proteins in the VEGFR2 immunopellet. (C,D) Lysates were subjected to immunoblotting
  with α-phospho-Akt and α-phospho-eNOS and in parallel gels, against Akt and eNOS,
  respectively, for normalization. (E) Nitric oxide (NO) was essayed in the media
  of primary heart endothelial cells stimulated with VEGF-A (40 ng/mL) for 20 min.
  Values were expressed as mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05 vs. no VEGF-A (solid bars)/same
  genotype; †p < 0.05 vs. (−) VEGF-A in all 3 controls; §p < 0.05 (+) VEGF-A (vertical
  lines) in all 3 controls.
