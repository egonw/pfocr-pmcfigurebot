figure_title: L4 RORB OSTN cells are neural activity-induced neurons
caption: a Schematic depicting the macaque visual pathway, OSTN+ neurons receive sensory
  inputs from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Drawings of eyes were created
  with BioRender.com. b Left panel, UMAP plot highlights the L4 RORB OSTN cells (Exc
  L4-6 RORB OSTN). Middle and right panel, UAMP plots of the expression of OSTN and
  LGI2. Blue circles indicate the L4 RORB OSTN cells. c Violin plots show the normalized
  and scaled OSTN expression level of macaque L4 RORB OSTN and mouse V1 L4/5 IT cortical
  cells. d Dotplot shows the distribution of L4 RORB OSTN marker gene-expression across
  all excitatory cell types. Black rectangle indicates the L4 RORB OSTN cells. e Left
  panel, representative RNAscope mFISH images of cells co-expression with LGI2 (light
  blue), RORB (green) and OSTN (red) marker genes from across layers of macaque V1.
  Scale bars, low magnification, 200 μm; high magnification, 50 μm. Right panel, percentage
  of positive cells across layers. Data are represented as mean ± s.d. and dots show
  the data points for individual macaques. The differences between groups were significant,
  as determined by one-way ANOVA. n = 3 macaques. f Heatmap of the L4 RORB OSTN upregulated
  and down-regulated genes compared with IT even subclass. g KEGG and Biological Process
  enrichment analysis of the L4 RORB OSTN upregulated DEGs (n = 200) revealed these
  genes overlap with oxidative phosphorylation and ATP metabolic process related genes
  while the L4 RORB OSTN down-regulated DEGs (n = 200) overlap with cell projection
  and morphogenesis related genes. P-value for each term was determined by Fisher’s
  exact test implemented in (g). Profiler with FDR-adjust for multiple comparisons,
  indicated as the color-coded squares. Source data are provided as a  file.
