caption: Transduction of IL-7 signaling pathway. IL-7 induces the activation of IL-7R
  downstream signaling pathway kinases, including JAK1 (linked to IL-7Rα) and JAK3
  (linked to common γC), STAT1, STAT3, STAT5, PI3K, AKT, and MAPK. IL-7 signal transduction
  promotes cell proliferation and survival and inhibits apoptosis by regulating gene
  expression levels in the nucleus, including a decrease in pro-apoptotic factors
  (such as Bad and Bax) and cell cycle inhibitors (p21CIP1 and p27KIP1) and an increase
  in anti-apoptotic factors (such as Bcl-XL, Bcl-2, and McL-1) and glucose metabolism
  regulators (Glut1, HXKⅡ).
