caption: 'Changes of TF and PAI-1 expression in pulmonary tissue 6 hours after LPS
  inhalation with or without NBDP pretreatment. A: RT-qPCR was performed to detect
  TF mRNA expression in lung tissues; B: RT-qPCR was performed to detect PAI-1 mRNA
  expression in lung tissues; C: Western blotting was performed to detect TF protein
  expression in lung tissues; D: Western blotting was performed to detect PAI-1 protein
  expression in lung tissues. Each bar represents the mean ± SD of 6 mice. *P<0.05
  compared with Control. #P<0.05 compared with Model. &P<0.05 compared with N-NBD.
  %P<0.05 compared with L-NBD. $P<0.05 compared with M-NBD.'
