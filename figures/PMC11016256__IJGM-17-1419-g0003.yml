caption: 'Targets of some miRNAs in the Classical and Atypical NF-κB pathways. (1)
  Classical NF-κB pathway: The ligand binds to the receptor and activates its proximal
  signaling bridging protein, which activates the activating IKB kinase complex IKK,
  which activates IKB kinase. The activated IKB kinase phosphorylates and ubiquitinates
  the IKB protein, resulting in the degradation of the IKB protein and release of
  NF-κB dimers. (2) Atypical NF-κB pathway: Ligand and receptor binding phosphorylate
  the protein kinase IKKa, which in turn phosphorylates and degrades NF-κBp100 to
  form a p52/RelB heterodimer or NF-kB p50/RelB heterodimer that enters the nucleus
  to regulate the transcription of target genes. (3) Both miRNAs involved in this
  signaling pathway play anti-fibrotic roles and have been labeled in figure.'
