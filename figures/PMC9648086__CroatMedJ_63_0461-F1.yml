caption: Results of Crystal Violet and MTT assays. (A) Cellular viability was assessed
  with Crystal Violet staining. Melanoma cancer cells were treated with the denoted
  concentrations of ornidazole for 48 h. (B-D) Ornidazole inhibits B16F10 melanoma
  cancer cells viability as determined by MTT assay. Melanoma cancer cells were treated
  with different concentrations of ornidazole for (B) 24 h, (C) 48 h, (D) 72 h. Results
  were presented as mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments. Each
  group with different concentration of ornidazole was compared with the control group
  (one-way ANOVA with Dunnet's test for multiple comparisons, *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01;
  ***P < 0.001).
