caption: 'Analysis of function and enrichment of GSE-DEGs. (A) CC category of GO annotation
  diagram of GSE-DEGs. (B) BP category of GO annotation diagram of GSE-DEGs. X-axis:
  enrichment factor (ratio of number of entries in the foreground gene set to number
  of background genes enriched in the same entry). Y-axis: enrichment pathways. The
  number of genes in the pathway determines dot size in direct proportion. The color
  of the dots (from red to blue) corresponds to the q-value reduction in sequence,
  although the difference is more significant. (C) Bar chart representing KEGG enrichment:
  enriched pathways of up-regulated genes (red) and enriched pathways of down-regulated
  genes (blue).'
