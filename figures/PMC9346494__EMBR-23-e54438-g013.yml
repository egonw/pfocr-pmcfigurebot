figure_title: The IFN‐JAK‐STAT1 signaling pathway negatively regulates miR‐324‐5p
caption: 'AU937 cells were treated with 100 ng/ml IFN‐α, 100 ng/ml IFN‐β, 100 ng/ml
  IFN‐γ, 100 ng/ml LPS, or 25 μg/ml poly(I:C) for 24 h. Identical concentrations were
  used in later experiments unless otherwise stated. qPCR analysis for the expression
  of MLKL.BU937 cells were treated with IFN‐α, IFN‐β, IFN‐γ, LPS, or poly(I:C) for
  24 h. and western blotting analysis of MLKL and β‐actin (left). Quantification of
  MLKL normalized to β‐actin levels (right).CU937 cells were treated with PBS, IFN‐α,
  IFN‐β, IFN‐γ, LPS, or poly(I:C) for 24 h. qPCR analysis for the expression of miR‐324‐5p.D,
  EU937 cells were transfected with NC, siMLKL, or miR‐324‐5p. After 48 h, cells were
  treated with IFN‐β (D) or IFN‐γ (E) for 24 h. Western blotting analysis of MLKL
  and β‐actin.F, GU937 cells were incubated with 300 nM ruxolitinib for 2 h prior
  to IFN‐β (F) or IFN‐γ (G) treatment. After 24 h, qPCR analysis for the expression
  of miR‐324‐5p. After 48 h, western blotting analysis of p‐STAT1, STAT1, MLKL, and
  β‐actin.H, IU937 cells were transfected with NC, or STAT1 siRNA oliogs (siSTAT1).
  After 48 h, cells were treated with IFN‐β (Η) or IFN‐γ (Ι). qPCR analysis for the
  expression of miR‐324‐5p. Western blotting analysis of STAT1, MLKL and β‐actin.JHT‐29
  cells were treated with IFN‐γ for 24 h. The cell lysate was collected for ChIP analysis.
  STAT1 binding to miR‐324‐5p promoter DNA region was determined by Chip‐qPCR. The
  amount of precipitated DNA was calculated as percent input. Data information: Data
  are represented as the means ± SD of three biological replicates. Statistical analyses
  were performed using unpaired Student''s t‐test. All experiments were performed
  at least three times, and representative data are shown. Source data are available
  online for this figure.'
