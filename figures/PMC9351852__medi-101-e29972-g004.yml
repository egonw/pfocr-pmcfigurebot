caption: THRSP genetic alteration and DNA methylation in THCA. (A) THRSP genetic alteration.
  (B) THRSP mutation. (C) The relationship between THRSP methylation and THRSP mRNA
  expression. (D) The promoter methylation level of THRSP in normal thyroid gland
  and THCA tissues. The beta value indicates level of DNA methylation ranging from
  0 (unmethylated) to 1 (fully methylated); ***P < .001. THCA = thyroid carcinoma,
  THRSP = thyroid hormone-responsive.

  carcinoma and its potential regulatory pathway.
