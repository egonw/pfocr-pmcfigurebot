caption: 17β-estradiol acts on the core protein of BMSC. A. BisoGenet 3.0.0 wused
  to search the protein interaction network of 17β-estradiol acting on BMSC. Node
  area was positively correlated with protein Degrrre values.B.cytoHubba 0.1 was used
  to screen 17β-estradiol acting on core proteins of BMSC. Node area was positively
  correlated with core protein Degrrre values.C. The 2D chemical structure of 17β-estradiol.
  D. The molecular docking diagram of 17β-estradiol and BMSC core protein. The red
  dotted line represents the hydrogen bond. (For interpretation of the references
