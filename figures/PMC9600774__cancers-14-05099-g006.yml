caption: Constitutive activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR-NFκB Pathway in SKOV3 mitigated
  the inhibitory effect of CC. (A). Western blots showing overexpression of PIK3CA,
  AKT and IKKA in SKOV3 cells and pBABE as vector control, and HSP90 as loading control.
  (B–D). Stable overexpression of PIK3CA, AKT and IKKA partially rescued the inhibitory
  effect of CC on SKOV3 proliferation. Line graphs represent the means ± SEM of the
  fold change in cell proliferation over 96 h. Values were compared to untreated cells
  0hr considered as 1; (n = 4/experimental condition, repeated twice). * p < 0.05,
  *** p < 0.0001, Student’s t-test. (E,F). Constitutive overexpression of PIK3CA,
  AKT and IKK mitigated the inhibitory effect of CC on migration and invasion. Bars
  represent the means ± SEM of cell count. Values were compared to untreated cells
  pBABE vector controls (n = 3/experimental condition; repeated twice). * p < 0.05
  compared to pBABE vector control treated with DMSO, ** p < 0.05 comparing CC-treatment
  to corresponding DMSO control, Student’s t-test. **** p < 0.0001.
