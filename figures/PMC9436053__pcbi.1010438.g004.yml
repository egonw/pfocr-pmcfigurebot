figure_title: Association of CHEK1 dependence with IGHV status in CLL
caption: '(A) Beeswarm plot of the CHEK1 protein dependence values in all samples,
  visualizing the increased dependence on CHEK1 in U-CLL tumors. Association testing
  was performed using Student’s t-test test (two-sided, with equal variance) and Benjamini-Hochberg
  correction was applied. (B) A network illustration of the off-target effect of CHEK1
  inhibitors that involves BCR components (BTK, SYK, YES1 and LYN). Only the high
  confidence pairs in the kinobeads dataset are considered. The drugs that only target
  CHEK1 are colored in red. (C) Beeswarm plots showing the effect of three CHEK1-specific
  inhibitors in U-CLL and M-CLL samples. Association testing was performed using Student’s
  t-test test (two-sided, with equal variance) and Benjamini-Hochberg correction was
  applied. (D) Differentially expressed hallmark gene sets in CLL cells after BCR
  pathway stimulation through anti-IgM treatment (ArrayExpress ID: E-GEOD-39411).
  Highlighted upregulated hallmark gene sets are associated with DNA-damage response
  and cell cycle checkpoint.'
