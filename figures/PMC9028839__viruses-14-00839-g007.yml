caption: In the conventional COPII pathway, after activation by Sec12, Sar1 attaches
  to the ER membrane with the N-terminus, further recruiting the inner coat proteins
  Sec23 and Sec24. Sec24 recruits the COPII outer coat proteins Sec31 and Sec13 to
  bend the membrane into a vesicle-like structure. In FMDV 3A-expressing cells, we
  hypothesized that FMDV 3A modifies the ER into a vesicle-like structure, including
  Sar1 activation/enhancement and 3A—a Sar1–GTP intercalating complex. That is, 3A
  enhances Sar1 activation. Next, 3A intercalates into two active Sar1s to bend the
  membrane into vesicle-like structures.
