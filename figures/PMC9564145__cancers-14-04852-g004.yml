caption: Expression of cell cycle and DNA repair genes in GBM cell cultures and parental
  tumours. Cnetplots of selected KEGG pathways genes comparing gene expression in
  GBMs and 20% (A) or 5% (B) cell cultures. Black dots represent a number of statistically
  differentially expressed genes in the given pathway in the particular comparison.
  (C) Flow cytometry analysis of DNA content in GCW04, GCW21 and GCW22 cell cultures
  maintained at 5% or 20% oxygen. Cell cycle distribution is shown as a percentage
  of cells at the indicated cell cycle phase. (D) Exemplary histograms showing DNA
  content in three cell cultures kept at 20% or 5% oxygen.
