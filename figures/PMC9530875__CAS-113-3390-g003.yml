caption: NEDD4 binding protein 3 (N4BP3) promoted vascular endothelial growth factor
  A (VEGFA) expression by enhancing the signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3 (STAT3) signaling pathway. (A) Western blot analysis of the expressions of key
  executive molecules in various pro‐angiogenesis signaling pathways. Consistent with
  the above sequencing results, other key molecules showed no significant changes.
  (B) Through dual‐luciferase reporter gene assays, fluorescence intensity of the
  STAT3 signaling pathway was significantly increased after N4BP3 was overexpressed
  in Huh‐7 cells, whereas the fluorescence intensity of STAT3 signaling pathway was
  significantly reduced when N4BP3 was knocked out in Lm3 cells. (C) Western blot
  and quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays showed that N4BP3 only affected STAT3 expressions
  and p‐STAT3 levels in the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, but did not affect the other
  molecules involved in this signaling pathway. (D) qPCR and ELISA assays were undertaken
  to confirm that blocking the STAT3 signaling pathway or interfering with STAT3 could
  rescue the increased secretion of VEGFA caused by N4BP3 overexpression in Huh‐7
  cells. (E) Tube formation assays were carried out to confirm that blocking STAT3
  signaling or interfering with STAT3 could rescue the increased number of complete
  tubular structures following treatment with supernatants from Huh‐7‐ov‐N4BP3 cells
