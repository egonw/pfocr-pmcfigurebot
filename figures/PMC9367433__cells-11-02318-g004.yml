caption: Active oxidative stress responses and increased ROS accumulation in ms33-6038
  anthers. (A) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of 712 upregulated and 462 downregulated
  genes between ms33-6038 and WT anthers from stages S8a to S9. (B) Expression changes
  of 194 genes related to the response to oxygen-containing component between ms33-6038
  and WT anthers from stages S5 to S9. The 194 genes were functionally grouped into
  7 types including ROS response (). FC, fold change. (C,D) Fluorescence imaging and
  relative quantification of the •OH contents (C) and the total ROS levels (D) in
  WT and ms33-6038 anthers from stages S6 to S13. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p <
  0.001, Student’s t-test.
