caption: GATA5 inhibits PCa cell proliferation by regulating PLAGL2. (A) STRING analysis
  showed that GATA5 interacted with PLAGL2. (B) The expression of GATA5 was negatively
  correlated with PLAGL2 according to the Western blotting. (C) Co-immunoprecipitation
  indicated the interaction between GATA5 and PLAGL2. (D) The effect of PLAGL2 knockdown
  was verified by Western blotting. (E–I) The CCK-8 experiment, colony formation experiment,
  and EdU experiment were utilized to compare the viability in different groups of
  PC3 and DU145 cells. Data are presented as mean ± SD of at least three experiments.
  * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01.
