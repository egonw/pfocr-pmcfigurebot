caption: HCRP-1 in CAL-27 cells functions via the regulation of the EGFR/STAT3 signaling
  pathway. Effects of EGF and colivelin on the migration and invasion of CAL-27 cells
  were assessed using the (A) wound healing (scale bar, 100 µm) and (B) Transwell
  assays (scale bar, 50 µm). (C) Western blotting was performed to determine the protein
  expression levels of MMP9 and MMP14. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001. HCRP-1, hepatocellular
  carcinoma-related protein 1; EGF, epidermal growth factor; Ov-, overexpression.
article_title: HCRP-1 alleviates the malignant phenotype and angiogenesis of oral
  squamous cell carcinoma cells via the downregulation of the EGFR/STAT3 signaling
  pathway.
