caption: Intracellular small molecules were isolated and metabolomic profiles were
  analyzed. (a) PCA of the intracellular small molecules. Metabolites from 2017 group
  separately from 2018 and 2019. Metabolites from 2018 and 2019 group independently
  but overlap in the 95% confidence intervals for several springs, most strongly in
  FS4 and FS5. (b) Heatmap of the significant identified metabolites between years
  determined using an ANOVA (p < 0.05). Sampling year is indicated at the top of the
  figure with each column representing one sample and each row representing an identified
  metabolite. The dendrogram at the top groups 2018 and 2019 separately from 2017
  based on the relative abundance of the identified metabolites. The figure was generated
  using MetaboAnalyst v4.0 (c) Metabolic pathways derived from the identified metabolites
  with the y-axis showing the p-value from an ANOVA of the groups and the x-axis showing
  the metabolic impact based on the metabolites identified and their role in the specific
  metabolic pathway.
