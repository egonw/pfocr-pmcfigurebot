caption: Proton traps in the photochemical reaction center and bacteriorhodopsin as
  compared with the ThrK+1-AspWB pair of P-loop NTPase. Distances are given in ångströms.
  (A) A high-pK proton trap in the photosynthetic reaction center (PRC) from Rhodobacter
  sphaeroides. Shown is the PRC in the charge-separated state (PDB ID 1DV3 []). Here,
  a proton path connects the protein surface with the buried binding site of the secondary
  ubiquinone acceptor QB. The proton is translocated over more than 20 Å via amino
  acid residues of the two PRC subunits, L and H. The proton pathway begins at the
  two His residues on the surface (His-H126 and His-H128); they are thought to have
  pK values of about 7.0 and to harvest protons that are ejected onto the photosynthetic
  membrane surface by the ATP synthase. From these histidine residues, the proton
  goes, via water-bridged carboxyl groups of Asp H-124 and Asp-L210, to the QB -binding
  pocket. Proton transfer from the surface to the more hydrophobic interior of the
  protein becomes possible after the QB molecule docks to the Glu-L212–Asp-L213–Ser-L223
  cluster [] and turns it into a buried, high-affinity proton acceptor (a membrane
  proton trap according to Mitchell []), with a functional pK of about 9.5–10.0 [,,,,].
  This high functional pK is apparently due to the expulsion of water upon QB binding,
  the negative charge on the Glu-L212–Asp-L213 pair, and the H-bond between Asp-L213
  and Ser-L223, through which the proton passes to QB. The functional pK value of
  the trap increases to > 12.0 after the appearance of an electron on QB and the formation
  of the QB−· anion radical, which attracts further protons into the buried catalytic
  site []. Mutations of either Glu-L212, or Asp-L213, or Ser-L223 block proton transfer
  from the surface [,,]. For further details, see [,,,,,]. (B) A high-pK proton trap
  in bacteriorhodopsin (BR), a membrane protein that pumps a proton across the membrane
  in response to the photoexcitation of its retinal pigment; see [,,,] for reviews.
  Shown is the superposition of femtosecond X-ray laser-captured structures of bacteriorhodopsin
  from [] in a closed resting state (PDB ID 6G7H, light-green) and in an “open” state
  8.3 ms after illumination (PDB ID 6G7L, pink). Additional red-coloured water molecules
  were taken from a high-resolution crystal structure of the V49A bacteriorhodopsin
  mutant that was crystalized in an “open” state (PDB ID 1P8U, []). In the BR, the
  key proton carrier Asp-96 has pK of ~12.0 owing to the absence of water in the vicinity
  and a H-bond with Thr-46 of the nearby α-helix. Replacement of Thr46 by a valine
  decreased the apparent pK of Asp96 by approximately two pH units [], which may characterize
  the contribution of the H-bond between Thr46 and Asp96 to the unusually high apparent
  pK of the latter. The photoisomerization of the retinal twists the α-helices and
  allows water molecules in the space between them; see the pink structure [,,,,,,,].
  The pK value of Asp-96 shifts to 7.1, which allows its deprotonation and proton
  transfer, via a transiently formed water chain, to the Schiff base of retinal at
  about 10 Å; see [,]. Later, the cleft between helices closes again, the pK of Asp-96
  returns to 12.0, and it is re-protonated from the surface [,,,]. (C) The Thr46-Asp96
  pair of BR it its resting closed state (the green structure from panel 10B, PDB
  ID 6G7H []) superimposed with the ThrK+1—AspWB pair from the transition-state-like,
  VO4--containing structure of myosin shown in D, orange (PDB ID 1VOM []).
