caption: HFD inhibits butyrate-producing bacteria to limit butyrate synthesis and
  secretion. (A) Prediction of changed butyrate production-associated KEGG pathways
  using Tax4fun analysis based on the SILVA database. Extended error bar plots illustrate
  differential representation by mean proportion and their differences based on KEGG
  orthologue groups, ranked by respective effect size of 0.5 thresholds in the Statistical
  Analysis of Metagenomic Profiles software package. Bar plots on the left side display
  the mean proportion of each KEGG pathway. Dot plot analysis on the right shows the
  differences in mean proportions between the two indicated groups using P values.
  (B) Butyrate synthesis-related enzymes. (C) Relative abundance of butyrate-producing
  microbiota and probiotics in fecal samples. (D) Heatmap of fecal SCFAs concentrations.
  (E) Differences in fecal butyrate concentrations between CD and HFD mice. (F) Assessment
  of the correlation between cecal butyrate and number of polyps. (G) Assessment of
  the correlation between cecal butyrate and ZO-1 expression level in the intestinal
  mucosa. n = 5 in each group. ns, no significance. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***,
  P < 0.001.
