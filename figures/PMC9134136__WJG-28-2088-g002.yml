caption: 'A series of highly conserved signaling pathways in the ductular reaction
  which promotes the occurrence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and aggravates
  the prognosis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (Created with BioRender.com). A:
  The Notch signaling pathway regulates expression of genes, such as the Hes and Hey-related
  family, to determine cell differentiation and function, maintain liver homeostasis,
  repair liver damage, and regulate liver metabolism, inflammation, and cancer; B:
  The Hippo/YAP-TAZ signaling pathway can regulate liver size, metabolism, cell proliferation,
  cell migration, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and formation of the extracellular
  matrix and cytoskeleton formation, etc; C: The Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway affects
  liver development and physiological functions of all liver disease stages, from
  initial injury and inflammation to fibrosis, cirrhosis and tumor occurrence; D:
  The hedgehog signaling pathway affects cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation;
  E: The HGF/c-Met signaling pathway activates multiple intracellular signaling pathways
  and affect cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation; F: The TWEAK/Fn14
  signaling pathway regulates tissue inflammation and damage repair in addition to
  cell survival and death. HPC: Hepatic progenitor cell; NASH: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.'
