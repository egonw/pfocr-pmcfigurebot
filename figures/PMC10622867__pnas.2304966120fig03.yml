caption: p53-mRNA HDPM NPs effectively expressed p53 proteins and activated apoptosis
  pathways in cancer cells. (A) WB analysis of the cell apoptosis–associated signaling
  pathway in p53-unexpressed H1299 cells after the treatment with empty HDPM NPs or
  p53-mRNA NPs. p53, PUMA, BAX, and cleaved-caspase 3 proteins were monitored, respectively.
  Actin served as the loading control. (B) Flow cytometry analysis of the apoptosis
  of H1299 cells after the treatment with empty HDPM NPs or p53-mRNA NPs. (C) Quantitative
  analysis of the cell apoptosis using the FlowJo software. Data were presented as
  mean ± SEM (n = 3), and statistical significance was calculated using two-tailed
  student’s t test (**P < 0.01). (D) Volume view of CLSM images of H1299 cells after
  the treatment with empty HDPM NPs or p53-mRNA NPs at the mRNA concentrations of
  0.5 and 1.0 μg/mL [p53, red staining; Cleaved-caspase 3, green staining; (Scale
  bar, 20 μm)].
