caption: Abnormal metabolic processes in melanocytes during oxidative stress. Oxidative
  stress triggered abnormal glycolipid metabolism within melanocytes, disrupting metabolic
  pathways. Melanocytes with mitochondrial disorders, abnormal melanin biosynthesis,
  and dysregulated metabolic pathway produce abnormal ROS, exacerbating oxidative
  stress. The orange-boxed portion of the figure shows outlier segments, as reported
  in recent literature. In addition, melanocytes interact with different immune cells
  in innate and adaptive immunity, leading to melanocyte loss ultimately. ARE, antioxidant
