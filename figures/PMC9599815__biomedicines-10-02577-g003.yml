caption: α-synuclein accumulates in Parkinson’s disease through EECs. (a) The general
  pathway by which EECs trigger α-synuclein transfer into brain. Aggregated α-synuclein
  produced by EECs is transported into brain through afferent neurons and vagal nerve.
  (b) Cell signalling of α-synuclein aggregation present in EECs. The EECs present
  receptors on the brush border to sense the microbiota metabolites. Triggering of
  endoplasmic reticulum releases calcium through RyR. The increase in calcium induces
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) synthesis in mitochondria, which further creates α-synuclein
  aggregates. Microbiota metabolites also increase α-synuclein expression through
  Atg5 pathway in EECs. Atg5, autophagy-related 5; EECs, enteroendocrine cells; ROS,
  reactive oxygen species; RyR, ryanodine receptor.
