caption: 'The pan-cancer pathway and miRNA network of RUNX genes. (A) Pathway activity
  showing the overall influence of RUNX on the tumorigenesis pathway in 32 cancer
  types ([the number of activated or inhibited cancers/32] Ã— 100%). (B) Heatmap showing
  RUNX proteins that are functional (inhibited or activated) in at least five cancer
  types. Pathway_A (red) represents the percentage of cancers whose pathways can be
  activated by a given gene; pathway_I (blue) represents the percentage of cancers
  whose pathways can be inhibited by a given gene. (C) Correlation between RUNX genes
  and immune and stroma infiltration scores. (D) The pan-cancer miRNA network regulating
  RUNX genes. Edge width is defined by the absolute value of the correlation coefficient.
