caption: DSB repair throughout the cell cycle. NHEJ is active in all phases of the
  cell cycle. In contrast, the HR pathway, which requires the presence of a homologous
  template for strand synthesis, takes place in the late S/G2 phase. MMEJ repair is
  active from early S phase until mid‐late mitosis (anaphase). However, under normal
  conditions, its activity is delayed until mitotic onset due to inhibitory effect
  of BRCA2 and RAD52. SSA is active in both early mitosis and S/G2 phase. DSB, double‐strand
  break; NHEJ, non‐homologous end joining; HR, homologous recombination; MMEJ, microhomology‐mediated
  end joining; BRCA2, breast cancer gene 2; RAD52, radiation sensitive 52; SSA, single‐strand
  annealing. [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]
