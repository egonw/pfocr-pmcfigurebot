caption: Microglial activation in neurodegeneration and neuroprotection. The diagram
  showcases the dual functions of microglia through M1 and M2 phenotypes. The M1 microglial
  phenotype promotes neuroinflammation through the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors,
  leading to neuronal damage. The related pathways involved in this process encompass
  Toll-like Receptors (TLRs), Nuclear Factor-kappa B (NF-κB), and the Janus Kinase/Signal
  Transducers and Activators of Transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway. On the other hand,
  the M2 phenotype of microglia secretes anti-inflammatory factors, thereby providing
  neuroprotective effects. This aspect is mediated through various signaling pathways
  including Adenosine Monophosphate-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK), Phosphatidylinositol
  3-Kinase/Protein Kinase B (PI3K/AKT), Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor
  Gamma (PPAR-γ), and the Notch pathway. Thus, the diagram delineates the dual role
  of microglia in neuronal health and disease, underlining the critical balance between
  the M1 and M2 states.
