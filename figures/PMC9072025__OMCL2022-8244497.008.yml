caption: 'Schematic illustration of IL-10 attenuating Ang II-induced aortic remodelling
  by inhibiting oxidative stress-induced activation of the vascular p38 and NF-κB
  pathways. IκB binds to NF-κB to inhibit activation of NF-κB signalling. Ang II increases
  ROS production and phosphorylation of IKK, leading to further phosphorylation and
  degradation of IκB, thereby activating the NF-κB pathway and resulting in the release
  of inflammatory factors and vascular remodelling. IL-10 inhibits the activation
  of NF-κB signalling by inhibiting ROS and the phosphorylation of p38 and IKK, thus
  inhibiting the excessive secretion of inflammatory factors and attenuating vascular
  remodelling. ROS: reactive oxygen species: IKK: IκB kinase.'
