caption: TREM-1 signaling (A), Role of Pattern Recognition Receptors in Recognition
  of Bacteria and Viruses (B) and Th1 Pathway (C) in the MLN of the IP group at 6
  weeks PI. Nodes are colored based on gene expression along with predictions of upstream
  and downstream molecules. A gene in red indicates upregulation, a gene in green
  indicates downregulation, a gene in orange indicates predicted activation, and a
  gene in blue indicates predicted inhibition. Uncolored nodes indicate that genes
  were not differentially expressed in the pathway shown.
