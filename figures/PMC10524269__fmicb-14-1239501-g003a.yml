caption: Analysis of specific breast milk proteins and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
  and Genomes (KEGG) tertiary metabolic pathways in human breast milk. The panels
  represent the KEGG tertiary pathway enrichment of breast milk osteopontin (OPN)
  at (A) 42 days and (B) 3 months, and (C) Îº-casein at 42 days in the low content
  (orange) and high content (green) groups. The KEGG metabolic pathway levels of different
  protein groups were compared by non-parametric Wilcoxon test. The horizontal coordinate
  represents the sample information detected. Yellow to red indicates the abundance
  distribution of different samples in tertiary metabolic pathways from low to high.
  The lower bar represents the tertiary metabolic pathways with significant differences.
  A p-value <0.05 was considered significantly different.
