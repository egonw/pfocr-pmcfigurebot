caption: Pg-LPS promotes the expression of JMJD3 and STAT3 in Th17-cell differentiation.
  (a) The mRNA expression of Jmjd3 and Stat3 was significantly increased in freshly
  isolated CD4+ T cells and activated CD4+ T cells under Th17-cell conditions. (b)
  After stimulation with Pg-LPS, CD4+ IL-17A+ T cells were identified by flow cytometry.
  The Th17-cell differentiation ratio was upregulated after Pg-LPS treatment. (c,
  d, e) The expression of RORC, IL-17A, JMJD3, and STAT3 was significantly upregulated
  with Pg-LPS at both the mRNA (c) and protein (d, e) levels. Data are presented as
  the mean ± SEM of at least three independent experiments. Significant changes are
  marked with *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001. Jmjd3, Jumonji domain-containing
  protein 3; Pg-LPS, LPS from Porphyromonas gingivalis; Rorc, RAR-related orphan receptor
  C; Stat3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3.
