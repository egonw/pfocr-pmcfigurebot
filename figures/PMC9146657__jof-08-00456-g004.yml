caption: Qualitative and quantitative analysis of transcriptomics data. (A) The principal
  component analysis (PCA) of different samples. PR-C2H4-1, PR-C2H4-2, and PR-C2H4-3
  are the three samples of primordia that underwent ethylene treatment. PR-H2O-1,
  PR-H2O-2, and PR-H2O-3 are three control samples that underwent water treatment.
  (B) The volcano plot of differentially expressed genes. (C,D) are KEGG pathway classification
  and Gene Ontology classification of differentially expressed genes.
