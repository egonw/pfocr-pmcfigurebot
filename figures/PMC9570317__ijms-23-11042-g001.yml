caption: Mechanism of baicalein, wogonin, along with their glycosides (baicalin and
  wogonoside) in inducing cell cycle arrest and regulating the canonical tumor-associated
  signaling pathway. Baicalin and wogonin induced cancer cell cycle arrest by regulating
  cyclin proteins (such as cyclin A, cyclin B1 and cyclin D1). Meanwhile, baicalein
  and wogonin promote cancer cells apoptosis and inhibit proliferation via PI3K-AKT
  and AMPK-mTOR pathways, respectively.
