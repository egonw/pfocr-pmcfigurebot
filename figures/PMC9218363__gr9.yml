caption: Overexpression of H6p21 decreases the sensitization of p21-knockout cells
  in response to NSC49L and TRAIL treatmentThe HCT116-p21−/− and HCT116-p21−/−/H6p21
  cells were treated with different concentrations of NSC49L and TRAIL either alone
  or in combination for 72 h and the cell viability was determined by the MTT-assay.(A)
  Western blot showing the overexpression of H6p21.(B) The IC50 of NSC49L in combination
  with TRAIL.(C) IC50 of TRAIL in combination with NSC49L. Different concentrations
  of NSC49L (0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 15 and 25 μM) and TRAIL (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and
  1.0 nM) were used in the synergy experiments. Data are the mean ± SE of four estimations.
  The p-value is shown on the top of graph A.
