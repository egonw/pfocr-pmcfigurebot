caption: 'LOXL2 and L2Δ13 regulate metabolic reprogramming.(A) Top: PCR conformation
  of overexpression of L2Δ13 in C57BL/6J mice; bottom: western blotting analysis of
  livers from wild-type (WT), heterozygous (Δ13/-) and homozygous L2Δ13-mice (Δ13/Δ13).
  (B) Volcano plot of differential gene expression between L2Δ13-overexpressing and
  age-matched wild-type control mice in RNA-sequencing analysis (n = 6; GSE145238).
  (C) Significant patterns for KEGG pathways of differentially-expressed genes of
  L2Δ13-overexpressing and age-matched wild-type mice (n = 6; GSE145238). (D) Heatmap
  of metabolite clusters in L2Δ13-overexpressing and paired wild-type mice measured
  by LC-MS-based metabolomics (n = 6). (E) Metabolic pathways analysis of the significantly
  enriched metabolites (q value < 0.05, fold change ≥1.2) using MetaboAnalyst. (F)
  Schematic representation of the L2Δ13-regulated metabolic flux in mice under physiological
  conditions. F6P, fructose-6-phosphate; FBP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate; G3P, glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate; Actyl-CoA, actyl coenzyme A. (G and H) Levels of ATP, glucose uptake
  and lactate of esophageal cancer cells following depletion of LOXL2 by specific
  siRNAs (G) and LOXL2-depleted esophageal cancer cells following ectopic re-expression
  of LOXL2 or L2Δ13 (H). Mean ± SD, n = 3–5. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 or ***P < 0.001.
  ns, not significant. (I) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) plot shows that LOXL2
  gene expression positively correlated with genes in the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis
  pathway (KEGG database/hsa00010, gene numbers = 68) in patients with esophageal
  cancer (NCBI/GEO/GSE23400, n = 53). NES, normalized enrichment score. P-values were
  determined by Pearson''s correlation.'
