caption: Changes in gene expressions in MDA-MB-231 cells with FAM49B knockdown, analyzed
  using microarray. A Heat-map analysis showing 1063 genes that were detected as being
  altered, by microarray profiling. p < 0.05 and |fold Change|≥ 1.5. B, C Disease
  and function enrichment of whole-genome expression microarray in FAM49B knockdown
  MDA-MB-231 cells was performed using IPA. D Canonical pathway enrichment of whole-genome
  expression microarray in FAM49B knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells was performed using IPA.
  E Gene interaction network of FAM49B and related genes in Toll-like receptor signaling
  pathway. The results show that Rab10, TLR4, and ELAVL1 (shown in red frame) were
  located in the central regulatory position. Data are shown as mean ± SD
article_title: FAM49B promotes breast cancer proliferation, metastasis, and chemoresistance
  by stabilizing ELAVL1 protein and regulating downstream Rab10/TLR4 pathway.
