caption: SOS1-IT1 is clinically relevant in EC and promotes EC cell growth. a, b The
  expression level of SOS1-IT1 in normal and tumor tissues of TCGA EC database. c–f
  The correlation analysis of SOS1-IT1 and clinicopathological parameters of EC, including
  the age, disease type, fustat and grade. g Kaplan–Meier analysis of SOS1-IT1 and
  the prognosis in EC patients. h, i The endometrial cancer cell line Ishikawa was
  knocked down with two different SOS1-IT1 shRNA (h), or transfected with SOS1-IT1
  plasmid (i), and the expression level of SOS1-IT1 was detected by real-time PCR.
  j, k The cell growth was performed by WST-1 assays in SOS1-IT1 knocked down or overexpression
  in Ishikawa cells. ** P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001
