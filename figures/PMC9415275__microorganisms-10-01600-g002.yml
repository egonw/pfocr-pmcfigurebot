caption: 'Expression of fibrosis-associated factors in response to HCMV/HHV-6A coinfection
  of human dermal fibroblasts. Cell samples were collected at the indicated days post
  infection (d.p.i.) and analyzed by qPCR microarray. (a) Scatterplot representation:
  the threshold was 2-fold change in infected vs. control cells; red and blue dots
  represent up-regulated and down-regulated factors, respectively; results are expressed
  as mean values of duplicate samples in two independent experiments. (b) Detailed
  values of down- and up-regulated factors: dark blue, down-regulation >10-fold; light
  blue, down-regulation between 2- and 9.9-fold; light red, up-regulation between
  2- and 9.9-fold; red, up-regulation between 10- and 99.9-fold; dark red, up-regulation
  >100-fold. All values above the 2-fold threshold are indicated in bold.'
