caption: The induction of GSK3α/β, CREB, ERK1/2, and RSK1,2,3 phosphorylation status
  upon PMA-mediated human promyelocytic HL60 cell treatment is inhibited by EGCG.
  Protein lysates from human HL60 cells, either in suspension or treated with PMA
  were harvested and processed for (A) PhosphoScan pathway screening according to
  the manufacturer’s protocol (Representative autoradiograms are presented), and (B)
  quantified by scanning densitometry. (C) Protein lysates were harvested from untreated
  HL60 cells in suspension and adherent cells upon PMA treatment in the presence of
  increasing concentrations of EGCG. Representative autoradiograms are shown for the
  indicated total or phosphorylated signaling intermediates, whereas (D) scanning
  densitometry was performed to quantify each of the phosphorylated status levels.
  The uncropped blots are shown in .
