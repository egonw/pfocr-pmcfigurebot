caption: 'Multiple DEPs are involved in pulvinus development. (A) Volcano plots of
  differentially expressed proteins of WT and elp1 mutants after proteomic analysis.
  (B) Comparison of expression ratios from transcriptomic (x-axis) and proteomic (y-axis)
  profiling. Log2 expression ratios were calculated from elp1 mutants vs. WT. Significant
  expression changes were labeled in colors: blue points, proteins only; orange points,
  transcripts only; red points, both. Concordance tests revealed that rPearson = 0.74
  between mRNA and protein ratios. (C) Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the
  DEPs between WT and elp1 mutants. (D) Pathway enrichment of differentially expressed
  proteins. (E) Selected significantly differentially expressed proteins in photosynthesis
  proteins and cell wall.'
