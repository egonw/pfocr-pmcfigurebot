caption: 'TGF-β1-stimulated SMAD3:4, STAT3 and AP1 signaling are blocked with pathway
  inhibitors. Specific pathway inhibitors were used to target the SBE, SIE and AP1
  pathways. (A) The SBE pathway starts with TGF-β ligand binding, which induces formation
  of a receptor complex containing type I (ALK4/5/7) and type II receptors. Receptor-SMAD3
  is recruited and activated by C-terminal phosphorylation (P). A complex is formed
  with the common SMAD4 and this translocates to the nucleus where it binds the DNA
  to the SMAD3:4 binding element (SBE: GTCTAGAC), activating transcription and luciferase
  signal. SB-505124 (SB-5) is an ALK-4/5/7 inhibitor interfering with SMAD-dependent
  signaling. (B) Pre-incubation of human chondrocytes (n = 4) transduced with the
  SBE-luciferase reporter construct for 1 h with 5 µM SB-5 before stimulation with
  TGF-β1 for 6 h, results in significant inhibition of luciferase induction with both
  1 (Pos ctrl) and 5 ng/mL TGF-β. (C) The SIE pathway consists of repeats of IL-6
  sis-inducible elements (SIE: TTCCCGTA) and is also called STAT3 response element
  since it is activated by STAT3. STAT3 is phosphorylated (P) by receptor-associated
  Janus kinases (JAK) in response to many different ligands. Tofacitinib (Tof) is
  an inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK3, thereby interfering with this JAK-STAT pathway. (D)
  Pre-incubation of human chondrocytes (n = 4), transduced with the SIE-luciferase
  reporter construct, with 1 µM of completely blocked IL-6 (Pos ctrl) and TGF-β1 (5
  ng/mL) induced SIE signaling. (E) The AP1 pathway is regulated by transcription
  factor Activator Protein 1 (AP1: TGA G/C TCA), which is a heterodimer composed of
  FOS, JUN and ATF protein families. These are activated by MAPKs pathways, consisting
  of the ERKs, p38s and JNKs. SP-600125 (SP-6) is an inhibitor of all JNK isoforms,
  thereby interfering with this AP1 pathway. (F) Pre-incubation of primary human OA
  chondrocytes, transduced with the AP1-luciferase reporter construct with 10 µM SP-6
  blocked luciferase induction with 20% FCS (Pos ctrl) or 5 ng/mL TGF-β1. Data are
  plotted as mean ± 95% CI with each dot representing the average of four technical
  replicates in one chondrocyte donor; in total, chondrocytes from four different
  donors were used, as seen in (B,D,F). Luciferase activity was measured relative
  to experimental condition stimulated with 5 ng/mL TGF-β, as set at 100%. Statistical
  analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post hoc test: ***
  p < 0.001. ALK = ALK tyrosine kinase receptor, ACVR2 = Activin type-2 receptor,
  GF = growth factor, IL = Interleukin, JAK = janus kinase, JNK = c-JUN N-terminal
  kinase, MAPK = mitogen-activated protein kinase, STAT3 = Signal Transducer and Activator
  of Transcription 3, TGFBR = TGF-β receptor.'
