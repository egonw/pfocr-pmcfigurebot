caption: Irisin mediates skeletal muscle-ovary crosstalk and inhibits the IRE1α-TXNIP/ROS-NLRP3
  signaling pathway in GCs. GCs were treated with DHT, in the presence or absence
  of various concentrations of irisin. A-B Cell viability was measured by CCK8. (C-D)
  The mRNA (C) and protein (D) levels of IRE1α, TXNIP and NLRP3 in GCs were analyzed
  by qRT-PCR and western blot. (E) The expression of IRE1α in GCs was analyzed by
  immunofluorescence staining (60 ×). F-G GC MDA levels (F) and SOD activity (G) were
  analyzed using an enzymatic colorimetric method. H ROS in GCs was assessed by the
  DCF-DA probe using confocal microscopy (90 ×). Data are shown as the mean ± SD.
