caption: '(a) The standardized Family Genetic Risk Scores (FGRS), with 95% Confidence
  Intervals, are seen on the Y-axis for the 16.3-digit Occupational Code Groups from
  the Swedish Standard Classification of Occupations contained in the two superordinate
  categories of (i) Managers and individuals in (ii) Occupations requiring advanced
  education that demonstrated significantly increased FGRS scores one or more of the
  ten disorders considered: Major Depression (MD), Anxiety Disorders (AD), Obsessive-Compulsive
  Disorder (OCD), Bipolar Disorder (BD), Schizophrenia (SZ), Anorexia Nervosa (AN),
  Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), Drug Use Disorder (DUD), ADHD and Autism Spectrum Disorder
  (ASD). The X-axis includes a description of each of the Occupational codes. For
  color codes for each of these disorders, see the right margin of the figure. Only
  those FRGS that are statistically significant after Bonferroni correction are depicted.
  By standardized, we mean that an FGRS depicted reflects the percent elevation of
  the familial-genetic risk score for a particular disorder in members of a given
  profession compared to individuals affected with that disorder. For example, the
  score of 68% for Ministers/Deacons on the FRGS for MD means that, members of that
  occupation, in aggregate, controlling for relevant covariates, have an FGRS score
  68% as large as what would be found for individuals affected by MD. For specific
  values of results in this figure, see . (b) The results presented are identical
  to those depicted in (a) with one exception. All FGRS are calculated controlling
  for the onset of the relevant psychiatric/substance use disorder before achieving
  the occupation, that is controlling for the possible pathway genes → disorder →
  occupation pathway. For specific values of results in this figure, see .'
