caption: Overview of hypothesis. Insulin/IGF signaling is critical for cellular survival
  and function. Preclinical mechanistic experimental studies have shown that impairment
  of the insulin/IGF signaling in adipose tissue and pancreatic beta cells triggers
  early onset of hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, diabetes, ketoacidosis, loss of
  adipose tissue and severe metabolic syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 impairs the insulin/IGF
  signaling pathway not only in the respiratory tract but also in metabolic (liver,
  adipose tissue) and endocrine pancreatic cells and tissues in association with downregulation
  of various metabolic pathways and excessive interferon responses such as the interferon-gamma-induced
  interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1). Risk factors such as older age, male sex,
  obesity, diabetes and genetic factors are associated with increased metabolic abnormalities
  and impaired insulin/IGF signaling pathway in COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 can directly
  infect the pancreatic endocrine cells and also induce indirect inflammatory and
  autoimmune responses that may further damage the endocrine cells. Collectively,
  the SARS-CoV-2 induced impairment of the insulin/IGF signaling may contribute to
  metabolic disease in COVID-19 and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC).
