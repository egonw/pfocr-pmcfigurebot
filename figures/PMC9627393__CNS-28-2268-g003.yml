caption: 'Fer‐1 or Res administration protected against HIBI‐induced brain atrophy/damage.
  (A) Representative brain morphological images taken on day 34 post‐birth. Fer‐1
  or Res administration protects against HIBI‐induced loss of brain matter. (B) Nissl
  staining in the hippocampal CA1 region on day 34 post‐birth revealed that HIBI resulted
  in irregular neuronal arrangement and an increase in inter‐neuronal space, both
  of which were alleviated following Fer‐1 or Res administration (n = 5 per group).
  Scale bar = 50 μm. (C) The neuronal density ratio in the hippocampal CA1 region
  indicated lower neuronal density in the HIBI group, which was improved after Fer‐1
  or Res treatment (n = 5 per group). Data represent the mean ± SD. ***p < 0.001 vs.
  the Sham group; ###p < 0.001 vs. the HIBI group. HIBI, hypoxic–ischemic brain injury;
  GPx4, glutathione peroxidase 4; Fer‐1, ferrostatin‐1; Res, resveratrol; CA1, cornu
  ammonis 1.'
