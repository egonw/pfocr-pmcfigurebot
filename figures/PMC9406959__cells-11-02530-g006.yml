caption: Overview of the canonical BMP cell signaling pathway and molecules investigated
  for potential therapeutic intervention in GBM. In canonical pathway, various BMP
  ligands binds to two receptor types (type I and type II) to form a heterotetrameric
  complex, which then binds to and phosphorylates the receptor-activated Smad 1, Smad
  5 and Smad 8. Extracellular inhibitors of BMPs including Noggin, Chordin, and Gremlin
  inhibit activity of this signaling pathway. Activated Smads (Smad 1, 5, and 8) form
  complexes with Smad 4, enter the cell nucleus and in combination with co-binding
  partners, such as p300 or STAT, act as transcription factors and activate multiple
  gene expression. BMP ligands that activate BMP signaling in the GBM and GSCs are
  in the green boxes. Receptor inhibitors that suppress BMP signaling in the GBM and
  GSCs are in the red boxes. DMH1 targets BMP type 1 receptors, JL5 inhibits both
  the type 1 and type 2 BMP receptors. Ym155 does not bind to the BMP receptors but
  induces the degradation of BMPR2. References are included in the main text.
