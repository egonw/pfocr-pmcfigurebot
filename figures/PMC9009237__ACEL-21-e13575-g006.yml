caption: Dopamine as a neuroendocrine–immunomodulator. Schematic representation of
  DA pathways in CNS and bidirectional DA crosstalk at central and peripheral levels
  orchestrating the regulation of neuroendocrine, autonomic, lymphoid, and gut axes.
  Bidirectional circuits linking brain DA to astrocyte and microglial crosstalk are
  schematically represented. There are three major DA pathways in the brain. The nigrostriatal
  DA pathway originating in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc, A9) releases
  DA into the corpus striatum (Str), which governs motor coordination. The mesocortical
  and mesolimbic DA pathways arise from the ventral tegmental area (VTA, A10), releasing
  DA into major brain limbic regions, including the nucleus accumbens (Ac), the amygdala
  (Am), the hippocampus (Hip), and the prefrontal cortex, constituting the mesolimbic–mesocortical
  reward pathway. Within the hypothalamus (HYP), the tuberoinfundibular DA system
  modulates the output of releasing factors regulating the hypothalamic–hypophyseal–gonadal
  (HPG) and hypothalamic–hypophyseal–adrenocortical (HPA) axes, neuropeptides, and
  hormones, including luteinizing hormone‐releasing hormone (LHRH) and prolactin (PRL),
  in turn involved in immunomodulation. At peripheral level, DA can communicate with
  the immune system to modulate its activity, directly through specific receptors
  in immune organs and cells or indirectly through the peripheral nervous system (PNS),
  via sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation, neuropeptides, and hormone release.
  Bidirectional DA crosstalk between CNS and gastrointestinal DA, within the brain–gut
  axis, also plays roles in modulating microenvironmental cues, including the inflammatory
  milieu and microbiome homeostasis
