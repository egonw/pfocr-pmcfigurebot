caption: Hierarchical tree of GAGE results for groups ‘А’, ‘В’, and ‘С’ pairwise comparisons.
  Top 30 pathways were selected with pathway significance cutoff 0.2. The size of
  dots at the end of branches corresponds to adjusted p-values printed in front of
  the pathways. Pathways sharing more genes are grouped together (the enrichment statistics
  and the lists of genes in each pathway are shown in a ).

  immune response- and angiogenesis-related expression patterns of early-stage cervical
  carcinoma as compared with high-grade CIN.
