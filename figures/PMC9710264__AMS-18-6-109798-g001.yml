caption: High-throughput sequencing was used to determine differentially expressed
  circRNAs in GC tissues and corresponding non-cancerous tissues. The cluster heatmap
  represented the 43 differentially expressed circRNAs in 3 pairs of GC tumor and
  non-cancerous tissues, which were selected out according to the screening criteria
  p < 0.001, false discovery rate ≤ 0.001 and |Log2fold change| ≥ 1, and red color
  and green color indicated high and low expression level, respectively (A). The expression
  levels of the top 5 up-regulated circRNAs – hsa_circ_0103546, hsa_circ_0101031,
  hsa_circ_0017728, hsa_circ_0103948 and hsa_circ_0103942 – were selected according
  to the fold change, and RT-qPCR assay was performed to verify their expression in
  55 pairs of tumor and non-cancerous tissues from GC patients (B)*P < 0.05.
