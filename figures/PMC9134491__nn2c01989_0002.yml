caption: Photoelectrical characterization and device development. (a) A schematic
  presenting the origins of the device development pathway. Filled circles and empty
  circles represent electrons and holes, respectively. The plot below displays the
  evolution of capacitive onset current and photogenerated charge amplitude (mean
  ± s.d. for N = 6), which were measured with the setup described in panel b under
  10 ms light pulses. Capacitive current stands for the peak photocurrent at the light
  onset. (b) Illustration of the open-circuit photocurrent/photovoltage measurement
  setup. A patch-clamp amplifier in voltage-clamp mode was used to record the photocurrents
  between the recording Ag/AgCl electrode and a distant Ag/AgCl reference electrode
  by positioning the patch-pipette close (<5 μm) to the device–electrolyte interface.
  The electrolyte is an artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), which mimics the in
  vivo extracellular medium of neurons (absorption spectrum of aCSF is provided in
  Figure S3). Effect of (c) ZnO, (d) P3HT, and (e) RuO2 layers on the photocurrent
  response of the biointerfaces. Red bars indicate light-on periods. (f) Photovoltage
  of QD-BI under 1 ms pulses applied at 100 Hz pulse frequency. (g) Deviation of the
  baseline photovoltage under 1 ms pulses for different pulse frequencies (mean ±
  s.d. for N = 6). For all measurements in this figure, optical power density was
  5 mW mm–2 and patch-pipette resistance was 5 MΩ.
