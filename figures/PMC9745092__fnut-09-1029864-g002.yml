caption: PPARα increased the activity of A-FABP promoter. (A–C) The 293T (A), C2C12
  (B) and 3T3-L1 (C) cell were co-transfected with pGL3-afabp, pCMV5-myc-pparα, pGL3-Basic,
  pRL-TK or pCMV5-myc for 48 h. Dual luciferase reporter gene system was used to detect
  the activity of A-FABP promoter (upper panel), and western blotting was performed
  to detect PPARα expression (lower panel). PK15 cells were transfected with the indicated
  siRNAs targeting porcine PPARα at different concentrations (10, 25, 50, and 100
  μM). RT-qPCR (D) and western blotting (E) were performed to detect the expression
  level of PPARα, and GAPDH was used as an internal reference gene. (F) PK15 cells
  were transfected with pGL3-afabp or pGL3-Basic for 24 h and then treated with siRNA-1
  or siRNA-Con as indicated. Dual luciferase reporter gene system was used to analysis
  the activity of the A-FABP promoter. Data were analyzed by t-test. **P < 0.01, ***P
  < 0.001.
