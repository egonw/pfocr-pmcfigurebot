caption: '| Monoterpene biosynthetic pathway and functional identification of MTS
  genes. a) The formation process of different monoterpenes. b) Phylogenetic tree
  of MTSs and its product distribution. Identification of product using GPP as a substrate
  and analysis by GC-MS. Heat map of the proportion of different monoterpenes in the
  total product of GPP catalyzed by MTSs. n = 3. Orange to green color indicates lowest
  to highest percentage of the product. 1, Linalool; 2, Limonene; 3, Terpineol; 4,
  Phellandrene; 5, Carene; 6, α-Pinene; 7, β-Pinene; 8, Borneol.'
