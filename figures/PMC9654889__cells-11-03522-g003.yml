caption: Effect of F-RBC vs. S-RBC resuscitation on cell cycle and inflammatory pathway
  genes. (A) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plot showing RNA-Seq samples analyzed
  by treatment groups. PHx substantially alters gene expression, as demonstrated by
  PC-1. PCA analysis confirms that the three samples of each group cluster together
  and that there is a significant difference between the RBC-resuscitated groups.
  (Bâ€“E) Significant differences are observed between resuscitation with F-RBCs as
  compared to S-RBC in several pathways. The top 30 differentially expressed genes
  between groups receiving F-RBC resuscitation and S-RBC resuscitation are visualized
  as heat maps of gene expression, where red indicates upregulated genes, and green
  indicates downregulated genes.
