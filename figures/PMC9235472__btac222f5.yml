caption: Ablation comparison. Compared with MLGL-MP, w/o PE removes the pathway encoder,
  w/o AP lacks the adapter in the multi-label predictor, MLGL-MP-r denotes alters
  the pre-trained node feature vectors in the pathway dependence graph to randomly
  initialized Gaussian vectors. The left panel indicates the performance by Accuracy,
  Precision, Recall and F1-score. The middle one indicates the performance with regard
  to Coverage. The right panel indicates the comparison in terms of Hamming Loss (HL),
  One Error (OE) and Ranking Loss (RL)
