caption: 'Romidepsin affects two TCA-fueling pathways: fatty acid beta-oxidation and
  glutaminolysis. (a) Schematic view of cytoplasmic ROS scavenging through NADPH producing-metabolic
  enzymes and their link with the three main TCA cycle fueling pathways (1/glycolysis,
  2/beta-oxidation, 3/glutaminolysis). Cytoplasmic NADPH producing enzymes are downstream
  of glutaminolysis in KRAS-mutant cells (ME1), downstream of TCA cycle through citrate
  production (IDH1), or downstream of the first step of glycolysis (PGD and G6PD in
  pentose phosphate pathway). (b) Basal OXPHOS and glycolysis were evaluated by measuring
  oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) using
  a Seahorse XF96 in four KRAS-mutant and five KRAS-WT cell lines after 18 h treatment
  romidepsin (clinical dosing). (c) The involvement of fatty acid β-oxidation in TCA
  cycle fueling was evaluated by adding 40 µM etomoxir to cell lines while OCR was
  measured in four KRAS-mutant and four KRAS-WT cell lines treated for 18 h with romidepsin.
  (d) The involvement of glycolysis in TCA cycle fueling was evaluated by adding 10
  mM glucose to glucose/glutamine-free medium while OCR and ECAR were measured in
  three KRAS-mutant and three KRAS-WT cell lines treated for 18 h with romidepsin.
  (e) The involvement of glutaminolysis in TCA cycle fueling was evaluated by adding
  2 mM glutamine to glucose/glutamine-free medium while OCR was measured in four KRAS-mutant
  and four KRAS-WT cell lines treated for 18 h with romidepsin. In (b–e), data were
  plotted as mean ± SD, and statistical significance between groups was assessed using
  an unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test in (b), with * indicating a p-value < 0.05.
  To assess the role of glycolysis, cells were glucose- and glutamine-deprived for
  1 h, and then glucose was added to the medium while OCR and ECAR were measured.
  Glucose addition increased glycolysis (ECAR) in all six tested cell lines, pretreated
  or not with romidepsin (d). In contrast, OCR decreased after glucose addition, reflecting
  a shift from OXPHOS to glycolysis as an immediate source of ATP. The subsequent
  addition of oligomycin A, which blocks ATP-linked respiration and forces cells to
  rely on glycolysis to produce ATP, allowed measurement of maximum glycolytic capacity,
  also unchanged after the HDACi treatment.'
