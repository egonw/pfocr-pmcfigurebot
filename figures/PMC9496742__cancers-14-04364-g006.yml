caption: Pathway enrichment and gene ontology analyses of CRC patients based on the
  necroptosis−related lncRNA prognostic model. (A) GSEA revealed the activation of
  some immune−associated pathways and tumour progression pathways in high−risk CRC
  patients. (B) GO analysis revealed that biological processes (BP, green colour),
  cellular components (CC, blue colour) and molecular functions (MF, orange colour)
  were activated in the high−risk group of CRC patients.
