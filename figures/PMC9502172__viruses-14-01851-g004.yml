caption: HSP27 inhibits the protein expression levels of adaptor molecules in the
  cGAS-STING signaling pathway induced by PRV. PK15 cells were transiently transfected
  with 1 μg of EV or Myc-HSP27 plasmid using Lipofectamine 3000 for 24 h followed
  by PRV infection (MOI = 0.001) for 24 h. Western blotting was used to detect the
  protein expression of cGAS, STING, TBK1, IRF3, phosphorylated IRF3, and Myc-tagged
  HSP27. GAPDH was used as a loading control (left). Greyscale analysis was used to
  measure the protein expression level of phosphorylated IRF3 relative to GAPDH (right).
