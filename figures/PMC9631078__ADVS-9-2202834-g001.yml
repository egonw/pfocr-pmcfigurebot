caption: 'BNIP‐2 knockdown activates YAP target genes in H9c2 cells. A) Heatmap represents
  genes that were up or downregulated comparing control H9c2 cells to BNIP‐2 knockdown
  H9c2 cells, and Day 0 versus Day 3 ATRA treated H9c2 cells. Reads per kilobase of
  transcript, per million mapped reads (RPKM) are indicated by Log2 RPKM. The color
  indicates the fold change difference (high: red, low: blue). B) The bar graph represents
  number of genes up or downregulated compared between samples using Poisson distribution
  algorithms to detect the differential expressed genes. C) KEGG pathway analysis
  identified pathway differences between Day 3 control versus Day 3 BNIP‐2 knockdown
  cells. Red boxes highlight pathways related to cardiac signaling. The color in the
  chart indicates the q‐value (high: white, low: blue), lower q‐value indicates the
  more significant enrichment. Point size indicates DEG number (The bigger dots refer
  to larger amounts). Rich factor refers to the value of enrichment factor, which
  is the quotient of foreground value (the number of DEGs) and background value (total
  gene amount). The larger the value, the more significant enrichment. D) BNIP‐2 knockdown
  increased the expression of YAP regulated transcriptional target genes (highlighted
  in red) and reduced expression of cardiac markers (cTnT and Myl2). Color intensity
  (high: red; low: blue) shows fold difference in reads per kilobase of transcript,
  per million mapped reads (RPKM) of BNIP‐2 knockdown cells against Day 0 and Day
  3 control cells. E) RT‐PCR analysis of total mRNA from H9c2 extracts shows that
  YAP regulated transcriptional targets, MYC, CTGF, and AXL, were increased in BNIP‐2
  knockdown cells. Knockdown of BNIP‐2 was also unable to reduce the expressions of
  MYC, CTGF, and AXL after 3 d of ATRA treatment. The graph represents mean ± SEM,
  n = 5. p‐values were calculated by the Student''s t‐test: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001.'
