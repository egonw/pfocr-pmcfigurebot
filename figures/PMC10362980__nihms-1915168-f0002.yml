caption: Expression of protein in NF-κB signaling pathway following TNF-α stimulation.
  Total PBMCs drawn at 6.5 months of age were stimulated with TNF-α (100 ng/ml) for
  the indicated time. Total cell lysates were prepared, and Western blotting was performed
  with NF-kB pathway antibodies. b-actin used as a loading control. The Western blot
  images were acquired and analyzed with Image Lab or Image Studio Software. The data
  shown are representative of two experiments. The relative band intensity of each
  protein was normalized to b-actin and compared to healthy control samples normalized
  to 10 (either 10 min stimulated or unstimulated samples). p-IKKa/b/IKKb and p-p65/p65
  values indicate that the phosphorylated values were normalized to the total protein
  of IKKb and p65, respectively, and to b-actin. Data are means±SD from 5 diferent
  healthy controls (HC) and two experiments from the patient
