caption: 'Information on patient samples and effects of Platin-L in different cell
  lines. Scatter plot representing the (A) PSA level, cancer grade group, and Gleason
  score of non-ADT-treated and ADT-treated patient samples. (B) Scatter plots indicating
  the relative expression of CPT1A in patient samples between benign and cancerous
  regions with respect to the number of nuclei. Quantification was done on the images
  using ImageJ software for an area containing 30 nuclei. Statistical analyses were
  carried out using a two-tailed paired t test with an α value of 0.05. (C) Structures
  of Platin-L and Platin-4. (D) IC50 values after multidose treatment with Platin-L
  in the NCI60 cell panel. Cell lines with dysregulated lipid metabolism are highlighted
  in red boxes based on the literature. Scale: max = 100 μm (deep red), mean = 14.5
  μM (white), and min = 0.38 μM (deep blue). (E) Modulation of the FAO pathway in
  the presence of etomoxir, Platin-L, cisplatin, lauric acid, Platin-4, or docetaxel
  in LNCaP cells. [Etomoxir]: 40 μM; [BPTES]: 30 μM; [UK5099]: 20 μM; [all other compounds]:
  100 μM. (F) Effects of Platin-L on the (upper) fatty acid dependency and (lower)
  glucose dependency of LNCaP cells. [Platin-L] or [cisplatin]: 10 μM for 24 h. Data
  are represented as an average with the standard deviation (S.D.) from three biological
  replicates. Statistical analyses were carried out using an ordinary one-way ANOVA
  analysis with an α value of 0.05.'
