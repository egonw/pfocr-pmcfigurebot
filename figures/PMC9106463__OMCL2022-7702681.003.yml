caption: The metabolic function of PKM2 is involved in modulating mitochondrial apoptosis
  of cancer cells; the enhanced glycolysis by PKM2 can attenuate cell apoptosis in
  cancer cells. PKM2 translocates to the outer membrane of mitochondria under oxidative
  stress. In the mitochondria, tetrameric PKM2 suppresses the p53 transcriptional
  activity and p53-related apoptotic pathway in a high oxidation state. Except for
  the p53-related apoptotic pathway, mitochondrial PKM2 can interact with Bcl2 and
  phosphorylates Bcl2 at T69, thus sustaining Bcl2 protein stability and controlling
  mitochondrial membrane permeability. Besides, PKM2 can also enhance the stability
  of NF-κB p65 subunit, promoting the binding of NF-κB p65 subunit to Bcl-xL promoter,
  thereby up-regulating the expression of Bcl-xL protein. PKM2 exerts its effects
  on apoptosis via the caspases-dependent pathway, including the expression of cleaved
  caspase 3, caspase 7, and caspase 9.
