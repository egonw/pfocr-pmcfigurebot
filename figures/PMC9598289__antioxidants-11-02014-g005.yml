caption: 9r attenuated mitochondrial membrane potential loss of H2O2-treated SH-SY5Y
  cells. After H2O2 treatment, the cells were stained with JC-1 dye. (A) Treated cells
  were examined using an inverted fluorescence microscope. (B,C) Changes in mitochondrial
  membrane potential were examined via flow cytometry. The results are shown as the
  mean ± SD of three independent tests. Compared to the described control group, ***
  p < 0.001. compared to the H2O2−treated group, &p < 0.05 and &&p < 0.01.
