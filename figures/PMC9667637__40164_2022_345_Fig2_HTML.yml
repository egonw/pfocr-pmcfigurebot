caption: Molecular mechanisms of NETs in tumor metastasis. HMGB1, released by NETs,
  promotes tumor metastasis by binding to TLR9 to activate p38/MAPK signaling. HMGB1
  also facilitates metastasis by binding to TLR4 or by regulating the degradation
  of VE-cadherin (CD144), followed by increased expression of EMT-associated genes,
  ZEB1 and Snail. The NETs component, NE, directly regulates mitochondrial metabolism
  via the TLR4-p38-PGC1-Î± pathway and promotes tumor proliferation and metastasis.
  NETs-derived NE and MMP-9 proteases are required for reactivating dormant cancer
  cells through degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) through the cleavage
  of laminin. In several cancer cells, NET-DNA directly binds to CCDC25, resulting
  in tumor metastasis.
