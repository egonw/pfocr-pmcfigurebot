caption: 'TdT-mediated dUTP Nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining to detect the effect
  of JDNW on the apoptosis rate of hepatocytes. (a, b) The effect of treatment at
  different time points on hepatocyte apoptosis in ACLF rats: 10 random fields/per
  slice, 3 random slices/per sample, representative of 5–6 rats/group. (c, d) Effects
  of JDNW serum on apoptosis of L02 cells induced by D-GaLN. Data are presented from
  three independent experiments. TUNEL-positive cells (green fluorescence). Each bar
  represents the mean ± SD (∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, “ns” p > 0.05).'
