caption: 'Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) activates the β-catenin pathway and promotes
  the phenotypic transformation and collagen secretion of atrial fibroblasts. (A-F)
  Western blot detection of the expression and the statistical analysis results of
  Wnt3a, β-catenin, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), collagen I (Col-I), and transforming
  growth factor-β type I receptor (TGF-β1) in the atrial fibroblasts; (G) immunofluorescence
  images and statistical analysis of β-catenin; the arrows indicate the nuclear localization
  of β-catenin; the blue is the nucleus, and the green is β-catenin; (H) immunofluorescence
  images and statistical analysis of α-SMA; the blue is the nucleus, and the green
  is α-SMA; (I) immunofluorescence images and statistical analysis of Collagen I;
  the blue is the nucleus, and the red is Collagen I. n=3, scale =20 µm. The values
  are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. *P<0.05, compared to Control; #P<0.05,
  compared to TMAO + ICG-001 group.'
article_title: The transformation of atrial fibroblasts into myofibroblasts is promoted
  by trimethylamine N-oxide via the Wnt3a/β-catenin signaling pathway.
