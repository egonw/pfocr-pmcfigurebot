caption: Effects of Chloroxylon swietenia leaves methanol extract (CSLME) in regulation
  of apoptosis related genes and Nf‐κB pathway in MCF‐7 cells. Western blot analysis
  of anti–apoptotic protein Bcl‐2, pro‐apoptotic proteins such as Bax and Bad, apoptosis‐related
  enzymes such as Caspase‐9, PARP and vital cellular pathway molecules, Nf‐κB p65
  in control and CSLME (20 μg/ml) treated MCF‐7 cells. Differences in the band intensities
  between control and CSLME treated MCF‐7 cells were measured by densitometry and
  represented in the form of fold change

  by down‐regulating the NF‐κB pathway in MCF‐7 breast cancer cells: In vitro and
  in vivo investigations.'
