caption: 'lncRNA HHIP-AS1 up-regulates HHIP expression and inhibits osteogenic differentiation
  of BM-MSCs. (A) The complementary sequence of the first exon of HHIP-AS1 and the
  first exon of HHIP. (B) lncRNA HHIP-AS1 in si-HHIP-AS1 or HHIP-AS1 transfected BM-MSCs
  was detected by PCR. (C) Fluorescence images of lncRNA HHIP-AS1 (Red), HHIP protein
  (Green) and DAPI (Blue) in BM-MSCs transfected with NC, si-HHIP-AS1 and HHIP-AS1.
  (D) HHIP mRNA in si-HHIP-AS1 or HHIP-AS1 transfected BM-MSCs detected by PCR. (E)
  HHIP protein in cell or in cell fractions of cytoplasm and cell membrane was detected
  by western blot after overexpression or knockdown of lncRNA HHIP-AS1. (F) RUNX2
  and OCN as well as (G) ALP and OPN protein levels in cells were detected by western
  blot after overexpression or knockdown of lncRNA HHIP-AS1. (H) ALP and (I) alizarin
  red staining after 14 days of osteogenic induction of BM-MSCs. The histogram data
  for each group are the average of three independent replicates; bars represent standard
  deviation; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. Scale bar = 10 Î¼m.
  Note: Protein levels in lncRNA HHIP-AS1 knockdown and overexpression groups on day
  7 were compared to those in NC groups on day7. Similarly, protein levels in lncRNA
  HHIP-AS1 knockdown and overexpression groups on day 14 were compared to those in
  NC groups on day14.'
