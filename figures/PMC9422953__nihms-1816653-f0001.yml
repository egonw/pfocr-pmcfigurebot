figure_title: A basic model of B cell contributions to the development and progression
  of heart failure
caption: 'Cardiac damage, even microscopic, can activate na√Øve B cells toward one
  of 3 functions: antigen presentation, antibody production, or cytokine expression.
  B cells can recognize antigens liberated in the injured myocardium and present them
  to T cells. B cells can also recognize antigens liberated from the injured myocardium
  and produce antibodies. They can also get activated to secrete cytokines and other
  immunomodulatory molecules. No matter what the pathway of activation is, B cell
  activation may end up promoting further activation of the immune system and adverse
  cardiac changes such as fibrosis, hypertrophy, and contractile dysfunction. This
  process can self-amplify as a closed-loop cycle. Importantly, B cells can also differentiate
  into IL-10-producing B regulatory cells that have anti-inflammatory properties and
  might work to break this cycle and promote the resolution of inflammation.'
