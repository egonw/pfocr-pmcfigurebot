caption: 'Schematic diagram of innate immune response caused by IAV RNA. Upon IAV
  infection, viral ssRNA in the endosome is sensed by TLR7/8 and recruits the MyD88
  adapter. Activated MyD88 induces the production of inflammatory cytokines through
  the TAK1-IKK-NF-κB signaling pathway. Viral double-stranded RNA in the endosome
  is sensed by TLR3, which further recruits TRIF and PI3K adapters, inducing the production
  of IFN through the TAK1-IRFs signaling pathway. Viral dsRNA in the cytoplasm is
  sensed by RIG-I and IFI16, leading to activation of NF-κB and phosphorylation of
  IRFs by binding to MAVS on mitochondria. Furthermore, IAV RNA can be sensed by NLRP3,
  which promotes the formation of inflammasomes, causing pyroptosis and secreting
  the IL-1β and IL-18. Of note, there is no direct evidence to demonstrate that IAV
  RNA can be recognized by DDX3X and MDA5 in mammals, which is indicated by dotted
  lines. Abbreviation: ROS, reactive oxygen species; MLKL, mixed lineage kinase domain-like
  pseudokinase. Other abbreviations are shown in the legend to .'
