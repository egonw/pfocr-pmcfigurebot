caption: 'Pathways of folate metabolism after FRÎ± mediated flux of 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate
  (5-methyl THF) across the choroid plexus into the CSF and then to the brain. Inside
  neurons, most methyl-THF will be stored while a proportion actively participates
  in metabolism. Methyl-THF transfers its methyl group to the B12-dependent methionine
  synthase (MS) enzyme, converting homocysteine to methionine. In the methionine cycle
  methionine is the precursor of the universal methyl-donor SAM, used in more than
  100 methylation reactions. In the remethylation cycle, tetrahydrofolate (THF) receives
  a mono-carbon group from serine and is converted to 5,10-methylene THF. Part of
  5,10-methylene THF is reduced by methylene-THF reductase (MTHFR B2) to 5-methyl-THF,
  while another portion is used to produce thymidine or is converted to 10-formyl
  THF, needed for purine synthesis. On the left side of the picture, the purine metabolite
  GTP serves as substrate for the GTP-cyclohydrolase I enzyme (GTPCH) to produce tetrahydrobiopterin
  (BH4), which is the co-factor for enzymes producing dopamine, serotonin and NO.
  At the upper right of the figure the transsulfuration pathway is shown. It converts
  accumulated homocysteine to the antioxidant glutathione to ameliorate oxidative
  stress. Abbreviations: BH4: tetrahydrobiopterin; D2: dopamine-2 receptor; GTP: Guanosine
  Tri Phosphate; NO: Nitric oxide; NOS: Nitric oxide synthase; RFC1: Reduced Folate
  Carrier-1; ROS: reactive oxygen species; TH: Tyrosine hydroxylase; TPH2: neuronal
  Tryptophane hydroxylase; 5HT2a: serotonin 2A receptor; SAM: S-adenosyl methionine;
  SAH: S-adenosyl homocysteine.'
