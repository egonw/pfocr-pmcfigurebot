caption: 'Melatonin in airway inflammation. Melatonin exerted a protective effect
  which was further suggested to be dependent on targeting its membrane receptor (MT)
  1 or 2 against airway inflammation in COPD. This is attributed to the inhibition
  of NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1Î² via the activation of SIRT1 in the lung tissues
  of whom with COPD. (Sirt1: Silent information regulator 2 homolog 1; NLRP3: NACHT,
  LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3; ASC: a protein; IL: Interleukin; MT: Membrane
  receptor)'
