caption: 'miR‐20a directly targets PTEN. (A) Bioinformatics analyses identified PTEN
  as a putative miR‐20a target gene. (B) Schematic overview of luciferase reporter
  constructs with WT or mutant (MUT) PTEN 3′‐UTR binding sites. (C and D) Relative
  PTEN expression in the indicated cells was measured via Western blotting in the
  HCC827 and H1299 cells treated with 0, .1, 1, 10, 20, 30, 50 μg/ml DDP. (E and F)
  HCC827 and H1299 cells were processed with miR‐20a mimics or/and 20 μg/ml DDP, and
  the level of PTEN protein was identified through Western blot. ***p < .001 versus
  control; ###p < .001 versus mock + DDP. (G) Luciferase activity in HEK‐293T cells
  was evaluated following co‐transfection of miR‐20a mimics and WT or MUT reporter
  plasmids. (H) RNA immunoprecipitation was used to detect physical interactions between
  PTEN and miR‐20a. Results are representative data from triplicate experiments, and
  outcomes are means ± standard deviation (SD) (**p < .01)'
