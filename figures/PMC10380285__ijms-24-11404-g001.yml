caption: 'Vitamin D-VDR pathways and regulation of downstream gene expression. Vitamin
  D exerts its biological effects by interacting with the VDR receptor through two
  distinct pathways: the genomic pathway and the nongenomic pathway. These pathways
  play a critical role in regulating downstream gene expression, which can affect
  hepatocyte and liver tissue homeostasis. (For a detailed description of the vitamin
  D-VDR pathways and the regulation of downstream gene expression, see the .'
