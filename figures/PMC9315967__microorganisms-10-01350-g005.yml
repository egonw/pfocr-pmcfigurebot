caption: KEGG pathway annotation by KAAS. The majority of genes in the genetic information
  processing, environmental information processing, and cellular processes belong
  to the core genome. Furthermore, the species has been found to carry diverse metabolic
  potential and is involved in many important biological pathways such as vitamin
  synthesis and synthesis of secondary metabolites.
