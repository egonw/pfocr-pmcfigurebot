caption: 'Validation of the gene profiling data, RAW 264.7 cells were pre-treated
  with BGG (10 μM) for 1 h, followed by LPS (1 μg/mL) stimulation for 23 h. Total
  RNA was isolated by using TRIzol reagent; the isolated RNA was subjected to cDNA
  synthesis, and SYBERgreen was used for amplification. The qPCR confirmed cell death,
  immune system, and metabolic process pathway genes. Actin was used as a housekeeping
  gene. Results are mentioned as mean ± SD (n = 3), p-value ≤ 0.05, (* p ≤ 0.05, **
  p < 0.001, *** p < 0.0001, and **** p < 0.00001). (A–L) (ns: not significant).'
