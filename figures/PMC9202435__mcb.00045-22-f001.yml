caption: Sensitivity of the newly screened sn134 and hus167 mutants to HU and DNA
  damage. (A) Schematics of Rad3 kinase signaling in the DNA replication checkpoint
  (DRC, left) and the DNA damage checkpoint (DDC, right) pathways in S. pombe. Superscripts
  represent homologous proteins in humans. When DNA replication is perturbed, Rad3
  phosphorylates Mrc1 and Cds1 to activate the DRC (). When DNA damage occurs outside
  the S phase or forks collapse, Rad3 phosphorylates Crb2 and Chk1 to stimulate the
  DDC pathway (, , ). Phosphorylation of Rad9 in the 9-1-1 (Rad9-Rad1-Hus1) complex
  is required for activation of both the DRC and DDC pathways (, ). (B) Sensitivities
  of sn134 (SK73) and hus167 (NF3) mutant to HU, MMS, UV, CPT, and bleomycin were
  examined by spot assay. A series of 5-fold dilutions of the logarithmically growing
  cells were spotted on YE6S plates or plates containing the indicated drugs. The
  plates were incubated at 30°C for 3 days and then photographed. For UV treatment,
  the cells were spotted on the plates, air-dried, and then exposed to UV at the indicated
  dose. Wild-type (TK48), rad3 (NR1826), cds1 (GBY191), and chk1 (TK197) cells were
  used as controls. (C) Sensitivity of sn134 and hus167 to acute HU treatment. The
  wild-type and indicated mutant strains used in panel B were incubated in YE6S medium
  containing 15 mM HU. At the indicated time points, cells were spread onto YE6S plates
  to recover for 3 days. Colonies were counted and presented in percentages. Error
  bars represent the means and SDs of triplicates. (D) Upregulation of the RNR small
  subunit Suc22 rescued sn134 and hus167. Suc22 was expressed in S. pombe on a vector
  under the control of its own promoter. HU sensitivity was assessed by spot assay
  as in panel A. “V” indicates an empty vector. (E) HU sensitivities of the integrants
  of wild-type (SK102) and mutant nse5 (SK103), and wild-type (NF339) and mutant smc6
  (NF340) were determined by spot assay as in A. The sn134 and hus167 mutants were
  included for comparison. (F) sn134 and hus167 mutant cells showed abnormal mitotic
  or cut cells in HU. Cells were treated with 15 mM HU for 6 h as in panel C, stained
  with Hoechst and Blankophor, and examined under the microscope. Arrows indicate
  the cut cells. (G) We counted ≥150 cells for each sample, repeated it three times,
  and the data are presented in percentages. Significant statistical differences between
  wild-type and the mutant cells are indicated by asterisks (***, P < 0.05, t test).
