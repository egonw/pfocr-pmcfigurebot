caption: ASPM is associated with cell cycle pathway. (A) The top 20 functional pathways
  (FDR <0.05) which the DEGs enriched based on the web-based Gene Set Analysis Toolkit
  (http://www.webgestalt.org/). (B) GSEA of KEGG pathway gene sets in ASPM high versus
  low samples from TCGA database (FDR <0.05, P<0.001, Normalized Enrichment Score
  =3.5371). (C) The 39 potential cell cycle-related genes (red) which ASPM may regulated.
  ASPM, spindle-like microcephaly-associated protein; FDR, false discovery rate; GSEA,
  Gene Set Enrichment Analysis; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.
