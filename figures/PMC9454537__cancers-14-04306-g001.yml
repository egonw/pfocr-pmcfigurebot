caption: 'Exercise changes numerous signaling pathways in B16F10 tumors. (A) B16F10
  tumor volume was measured by caliper over time in mice treated with exercise (Ex),
  doxorubicin (Doxo), Ex plus Doxo (Ex + Doxo), or no exercise (Con) (n = 6 or 7 tumors
  per group). Red line and blue triangle indicate the day(s) that mice were treatment
  with exercise and(or) doxorubicin, respectively. Data are shown as mean ± SEM. *
  p < 0.05 vs. Con, ## p < 0.01 vs. Ex. (B–D) RPPA was performed on B16F10 whole-tumor
  homogenates from Ex, Doxo, Ex + Doxo, or Con mice (n = 5 tumors per group). (B)
  Principal component analysis (PCA) summarized different protein signatures from
  387 proteins among groups. (C) A volcano plot analysis identified significantly
  increased (red, n = 70) and decreased (blue, n = 53) proteins in B16F10 tumors from
  Ex mice compared to tumors from Con mice. The number following the protein numbers
  indicates the predicted number of changed genes based on RPPA data. The horizontal
  line indicates p-value at 0.05. (D) Hierarchical clustering was performed using
  the 123 significantly changed proteins or protein modifications from the comparison
  between Ex and Con. (E) An Ingenuity Pathway Analysis determined the top 10 upregulated
  (red) and downregulated (blue) canonical pathways in tumors from Ex relative to
  Con mice.'
