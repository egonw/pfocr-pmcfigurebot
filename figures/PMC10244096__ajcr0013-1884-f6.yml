caption: 'Cytosolic DBP regulated the production of glycogen and ATP in HepG2 cells
  via PI3K/AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway. A, B. WB of p-GSK3β and GSK3β. β-actin: loading
  control. Data were quantified. C. Glycogen levels in the indicated cells. D. Glucose
  uptake as indicated by 2-NBDG fluorescence intensity in the treated cells. Scale
  bar (left) = 100 μm, scale bar (right) = 30 μm. E. Glycogen staining by PAS in tumors
  and the adjacent liver tissues of HCC patients (n = 4). PAS-positive staining (magenta)
  was marked by arrows. Scale bars = 100 μm. F. WB of p-GSK3β in the mitochondrial
  fraction of cells. COXIV and β-actin: mitochondrial and cytosolic markers, respectively.
  Data were quantified. G. The IF staining of p-GSK3β (green), mitochondrial COXIV
  (red), and their merge (yellow). PCC data were quantified. Scale bars = 10 μm. H.
  The enzymatic activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III in the treated
  cells. I. ATP levels in the treated cells. HepG2 cells were infected with control
  adenovirus (Empty), DBP-SKL, or DBP-deSKL. HepG2 cells were also treated with non-specific
  siRNA (siNC), DBP specific siRNA (siDBP), AKT specific siRNA (siAKT). MK: MK2206,
  AKT inhibitor. Data were presented as mean ± SD. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001
  vs. Empty group; #P<0.05, ##P<0.01 vs. DBP-SKL group; •P<0.05, ••P<0.01 and •••P<0.001
  vs. DBP-deSKL group.'
