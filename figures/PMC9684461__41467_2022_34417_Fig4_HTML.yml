figure_title: Kap120 recognizes Xrn1 NLSs
caption: a Interaction of Kap120 with Xrn1 is mediated by its NLSs. Affinity purified
  FLAG-tagged Xrn1 or its mutant derivative, Xrn1ΔNLS1/2, and recombinant Kap120-6xHis
  that had been purified with Ni-NTA column were mixed together and co-IPed with Ni-NTA
  column, followed by Western blotting. Xrn1-FLAG intensity was normalized to Kap120
  intensity, defining Xrn1WT/Kap120 as 100%. n = 3 biologically independent experiments.
  Error bars represent standard deviation (S.D.). p values were determined by two-tailed
  unpaired t-test. b Kap120 binds both Xrn1 NLSs. Experiment shown in a was repeated
  three times. Xrn1-FLAG intensity was normalized to Kap120 intensity, defining arbitrarily
  Xrn1ΔNLS2/Kap120 as 100%. n = 3 biologically independent experiments. Error bars
  represent standard deviation (S.D.). p-values were determined by two-tailed unpaired
  t-test. c Xrn1 interaction with Kap120 is mediated by NLSs in optimally proliferating
  cells. TAP-tagged Kap120 was affinity purified with IgG-sepharose and the co-IPed
  proteins were subjected to Western blotting. Quantification is shown in d. d NLS1/2
  are required for efficient co-IP with Kap120 of Xrn1 and other DFs. The membrane
  shown in c and two more membranes of additional replicates were also decorated with
  anti-Pat1 and anti-Dhh1 antibodies. Signals (minus that of the no-tag control) were
  normalized to that of Kap120. The normalized WT signal was defined as 100%. n = 3
  (for Xrn1), n = 2 (for Dhh1 and Pat1) biologically independent experiments. Error
  bars represent standard deviation (S.D.). p values were determined by two-tailed
  unpaired t-test. e Kap120 is used for efficient import of TailS454P-GFP. Optimally
  proliferating WT or Δkap120 cells expressing TailS454P-GFP and NUP49-mCherry (to
  mark the nucleus) were inspected microscopically. The nuclear/whole-cell ratio of
  the fluorescent signal was determined by ImageJ, see Methods. The mean ratio (Mean
  nuclear intensity/Mean whole-cell intensity) is represented in a jittered box-plot.
  Each box represents the 25th to 75th percentile of values, with the median noted
  by the horizontal bar. Whiskers terminate at maxima/minima or a distance of 1.5
  times the inter quartile range (IQR) away from the upper/lower quartile, whichever
  is closer. The p-value was calculated using Wilcoxon rank sum test (**** - ≤ 0.0001)
  f RNA blocks Xrn1-Kap120 interaction. Interaction between purified Kap120-6xHis
  and FLAG-tagged Xrn1 carrying mutations in indicated NLS, was determine as in a,
  except that EDTA (to inactivate Xrn1) and increasing amounts of 40 b RNA were included.
  Xrn1-Kap120 complexes were affinity purified by anti-FLAG antibodies and analysed
  and quantified as in a. n = >100 cells examined over 3 independent experiments.
  Error bars represent standard deviation (S.D.). g Deletion of KAP120 affects mRNA
  synthesis and decay, but not mRNA level. Genomic Run-On (GRO) analysis was performed
  (n = 3), as described in Method. Box and whisker plot of the median levels (in arbitrary
  units) of synthesis rate (SR), half-lives (HLs) and mRNA abundance (RA). Each box
  represents the 25th to 75th percentile of values, with the median noted by the horizontal
  bar. Whiskers terminate at maxima/minima or a distance of 1.5 times the IQR away
  from the upper/lower quartile, whichever is closer. P value was calculated by Wilcoxon
  rank sum test (p < 0.001).
