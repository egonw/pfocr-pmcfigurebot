figure_title: Comparison of the onset of instability in the coupled pathway case vs
  the single pathway case
caption: '(A) Pathway enzyme and cycling enzyme limits in the single and coupled pathway
  cases (see legend, pathway enzyme limit is the same for each case). For the coupled
  pathway,  is set to. Since the limiting factor depends on the difference between  and
  , higher  values are possible without build up of upstream metabolites if all other
  parameters are kept the same. (B) Time series of M0, M1 and  in the single pathway
  case where the parameters for  and  are set by the black dot in (A). Here we see
  build up M0 because . (C) Time series of , , ,  and  in the coupled pathway case
  where the parameters for ,  and  are set by the black dot in (A). Here we see the
  system admits a steady state because. The parameters in all panels are: ,,,.'
