caption: Screening for genes critical for cervical cancer-derived cell lines viability.
  A lentiviral shRNA library targeting 116 genes involved in DNA damage signaling/repair
  and tumor suppressors were used to silence specific genes in cervical cancer cell
  lines and PHK. Cells were seeded in 96 wells plates (2000 cells/well) and infected
  with lentiviral particles expressing specific shRNAs after 24 h. Alamar Blue was
  added (10 μL/well) after 72 h and its reduction was determined after four hours
  by absorbance measuring at 570 and 600 nm. Viability/proliferation inhibition values
  are presented as relative to those observed in control cells (each parental cell
  line transduced with scramble shRNA). (A) Candidate genes were arbitrary, defined
  as those which silenced reduced SiHa and HeLa cells proliferation by 30% or more.
  (B) Genes identified were further validated in PHK to determine those that induced
  inhibition of cell viability/proliferation preferentially in SiHa and HeLa cells
  (Student t-test p < 0.05 [*] for all comparisons between PHK and tumor cells).
