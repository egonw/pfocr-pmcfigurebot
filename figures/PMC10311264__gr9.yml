caption: GAS promoter activity of type II IFN signaling is associated with FMDV 3C
  protease activity in degrading KPNA1. A HeLa cells cotransfected with increased
  dose of pXJ41-FLAG-KPNA1 and pXJ41-3C or its mutants and pGAS-Luc as well as pRL-TK
  for 24 ​h were incubated with 100 ​ng/mL human IFN-γ for 16 ​h. Luciferase assay
  was performed as described above. Data represent the mean ​± ​the standard deviations
  (error bars) of three experiments. B Expression of KPNA1, 3C or its mutant protein
  was measured by Western blotting using antibody against FLAG or HA. β-actin was
  used as a protein loading control. ∗, P ​< ​0.05.
