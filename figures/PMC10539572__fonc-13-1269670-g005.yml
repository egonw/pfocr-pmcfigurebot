caption: The activity of various indole oligomers is associated with apoptosis and
  AKT signaling pathways and LTe2 targeting is optimal. (A) The heat map showed that
  AKT1 was considered a differentially expressed gene after treatment of indole oligomers.
  (B) KEGG pathway analysis of the RNA-seq data indicated that various indole oligomers
  were associated with the apoptosis signaling pathway. (C) The molecular dynamics
  (MD) experiments showed that I3C, LTe2 and T7 have relatively low RMSD and stable
  binding mode. (D) The score value of molecular docking. (E–G) The combination modes
  of I3C, LTe2 and T7.
