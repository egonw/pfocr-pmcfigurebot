caption: Pathway enrichment of 24 signature miRNA-mRNA interactions. (A) Enrichment
  maps with significantly enriched KEGG pathways (adjusted p-values < 0.05) of the
  top 1000 miRNA-mRNA interactions. Information on gene count/size (i.e., the number
  of genes enriched in a KEGG pathway) is given. Pathways occurring exclusively in
  24-miRNA-positive/HPV-associated (upper panel) or 24-miRNA-negative/HPV-negative
  tumours (lower panel) are labelled. (B) Heatmap including genes of identified significantly
  enriched pathways exclusively associated with miRNA-mRNA interactions in 24-miRNA-positive/HPV-associated
  and 24-miRNA-negative/HPV-negative HNSCC. Heat map colours indicate mRNA expression
  z-scores on a scale of âˆ’4 to 4.
