caption: 'FGF10 is upregulated in UVB‐induced skin injury. (A) The method of UVB radiation
  treatment in C57BL/6J mice experimental model. (B) Skin injury induced by UVB radiation.
  Skin of wild‐type (WT) C57BL/6J mice (Left). Skin of UVB radiation C57BL/6J mice
  (Right). (C) HE staining of wild‐type (WT) C57BL/6J mice and UVB radiation C57BL/6J
  mice. (n = 5). Scale bars = 100 μm. (D) Immunohistochemical staining of wild‐type
  (WT) C57BL/6J mice and UVB radiation C57BL/6J mice. The positive staining (brown)
  demonstrated positive expression (n = 5). Scale bars = 100 μm. (E) Quantification
  of epidermal thickness from (C). (F) Quantification of AOD from (D). (G) Quantified
  by quantitative real‐time PCR (qRT‐PCR) in untreated skin and UVB treated skin.
  The skin of epidermis and dermis were counted separately (n = 5). The data are presented
  as the means ± SEM. ###P < 0.001, ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05, vs. the corresponding
  UVB untreated group; N.S., nonsignificant'
