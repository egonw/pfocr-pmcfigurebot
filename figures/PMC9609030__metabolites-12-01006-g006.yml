caption: Specific metabolic changes induced by UGT expression. (A) Expression of UGT2B7
  proteins is associated with elevated metabolites of the creatine pathway. Fold changes
  (FC) relative to control cells are provided in the heatmap. Non-significant metabolites
  are displayed in white. SAM, S-adenosyl-methionine; SAH, S-adenosyl-homocysteine;
  DMGly, dimethyl-glycine; GAMT, guanidinoacetate methyltransferase. (B) GAMT mRNA
  expression are increased in cells expressing UGT2B7 proteins when compared to control
  cells. *** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.01 (C) Metabolites upstream from the oxoglutarate
  dehydrogenase complex (OGDC) in the TCA cycle are elevated in cells expressing UGT1A1
  proteins. Branched-chain keto acids (BCKA) are also enriched in alt. UGT1A1 cells.
  (D) Co-immunoprecipitations (co-IPs) revealed no interaction between UGT1A1 and
  the oxoglutarate dehydrogenase-like (OGDHL) protein, a key regulator of the OGDC.
  (E) The alt. UGT1A1 interacts with OGDHL, as detected by co-IP. Co-IPs were conducted
  using anti-myc (UGT1A1) or anti-V5 (alt. UGT1A1) and control IgG antibodies. Western
  blots were revealed with in-house anti-UGT1A (RC-71; for UGT1A1), anti-V5 (for alt.
  UGT1A1) or anti-Flag (for OGDHL) antibodies.
