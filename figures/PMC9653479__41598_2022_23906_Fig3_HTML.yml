caption: RSL3 suppresses K1 cell viability, K1 tumor cell spheroid formation and viability,
  and arrests thyroid tumor cell migration in vitro. (A) Viability of K1 cells treated
  with RSL3 (2 μM), Fer1, ZVAD, and combination of RSL3 with Fer1 or ZVAD. (B) Representative
  microscopy image showing arrested K1 cell migration after RSL3 treatment (× 10 magnification).
  (C) Representative microscopy image showing impaired spheroid formation of K1 cells
  after RSL3 treatment (× 20 magnification). (D) Viability of spheroids treated with
  RSL3 and Fer1 for 48 h were assessed (*p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, ****
  p < 0.0001, ns—p > 0.05). (E) Representative microscopic images showing propidium
  iodide (PI) staining of K1 spheroids treated with RSL3, Fer1 and ZVAD for 48 h.
