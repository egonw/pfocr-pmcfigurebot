caption: Effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 supplementation on JAK/STAT signaling pathway in PEDV-infected-IPEC-J2
  and 3D4/21 cells. IPEC-J2 cells were infected with PEDV at MOI of 1. After 1 h of
  absorption, the cells were washed with PBS and then cultured with fresh culture
  medium for different times. Then, the cells were collected for Western blotting
  analysis (A). IPEC-J2 cells were pretreated with 1,25(OH)2D3 (20 nM) for 24 h, and
  then infected with PEDV at MOI of 1. After 1 h of absorption, the cells were washed
  with PBS and then cultured with 1,25(OH)2D3 (20 nM) for 1 h (B) or 24 h in IPEC-J2
  (C) and 3D4/21 cells (D). Finally, the cells were collected for Western blotting
  analysis.
