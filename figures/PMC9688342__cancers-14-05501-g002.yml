caption: 'Schematic overview of the UNet (blue box) and MV (red box) networks. UNet
  consists of an encoder (left) and a decoder (right) pathway that generates binary
  segmentation maps from 64 cubed voxel patches sampled from planning CTs. MV uses
  three multi-view branches that build up to each anatomical plane within a scale
  block, the output of which is concatenated and used as the input for the multi-scale
  branched architecture. The thickness of the convolutional blocks corresponded with
  the number of filters used. The number of output classes (M) was six for UNet in
  the UNet-only configuration and two for UNet in the UNet+MV configuration. M was
  six for MV in the MV-only configuration and five in the UNet+MV configuration. Abbreviations:
  MV: multi-view; ch: number of channels; BN: batch normalization; ReLu: rectified
  linear unit; f: number of output filters; M: number of output classes; K: convolution
  kernel size; S: convolution stride; BN: batch normalization; p: dropout fraction:
  CT: computed tomography.'
