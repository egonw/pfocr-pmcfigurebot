caption: Manipulation of autophagy in astrocytes after ischemic stroke. DEX exerts
  a neuroprotection against OGD-induced astrocytes injury via activation of astrocytes
  autophagy by regulating the TSC2/mTOR signaling pathway []. Circular RNA 0025984
  protects astrocytes from ischemic injury via inhibition of autophagy by targeting
  the miR-143-3p/TET1/ORP150 pathway []. G1 treatment restores autophagy in astrocytes
  via activation of G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GRP30) and protected neurons after
  ischemic stroke []. Ginkgolide K promotes astrocyte proliferation and migration
  after oxygen-glucose deprivation via inducing protective autophagy through the AMPK/mTOR/ULK1
  signaling pathway []. Knockdown of Circular RNA HECTD1 inhibits astrocyte autophagy
  via MIR142/TIPARP axis, resulting in inhibition of astrocyte activation after cerebral
  ischemic stroke []. Nec-1, a specific inhibitor of RIP1K, decreased RIP1Kâ€“RIP3K
  complex formation and inhibited autophagy, thereby attenuating astrocytic necrotic
  cell death in the ischemic cortex [].
