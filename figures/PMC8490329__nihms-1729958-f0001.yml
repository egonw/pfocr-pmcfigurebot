caption: Individual urinary phenol, phthalate, and organophosphate ester (OPE) biomarkers
  associated with increased (red connection) or decreased (blue connection) concentrations
  of plasma oxylipins among pregnant women (n = 89).,1 Associations estimated by linear
  mixed effects models that were adjusted for gestational age at sampling and maternal
  age, race/ethnicity, pre-pregnancy BMI, education, and delivery year. Red and blue
  connections in the chord diagram represent statistically significant positive and
  negative associations after FDR adjustment (i.e., q<0.10), respectively. Statistically
  null associations (i.e., q≥0.10) are left blank. Corresponding numerical estimates
  are provided in .2 Oxylipins are grouped by biosynthetic pathway, including fatty
  acid precursor (i.e., linoleic acid [LA], arachidonic acid [AA], docosahexaenoic
  acid [DHA], eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA]) and enzyme group (i.e., cytochrome P450
  [CYP], lipoxygenase [LOX], and cyclooxygenase [COX]). DEHP represents ∑DEHP of corresponding
  metabolites.
