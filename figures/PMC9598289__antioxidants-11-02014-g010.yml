caption: The PI3K/AKT pathway participates in the cytoprotective role of 9r. (A) p-PI3K,
  p-Akt, p-mTOR and p-GSK3β Western blot analysis. (B) The Image Lab program was used
  to estimate the relative intensities of p-PI3K, p-Akt, p-mTOR and p-GSK3β. The data
  are provided as the mean and standard deviation of three separate experiments. *
  p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001 when compared to the corresponding control.
  &p < 0.05 and &&p < 0.01 compared to the H2O2−treated group.
