caption: 'CSF2 is the main difference gene between the adherent and the suspended
  SCLC phenotypes. H69A and H69S were detected with RNA sequencing. (A) Heat map representation
  of 404 differentially expressed genes. The significantly enriched GO annotations
  in (B) Biological Process, (C) Cellular Components and (D) Molecular Function analysis
  of 404 differentially expressed genes. (E) KEGG pathway analysis of 404 different
  genes. (F) H69A and H69S cells were collected and CSF2 mRNA levels were evaluated
  with reverse-transcription quantitative PCR by using the 2-ΔΔCq method. (G) CSF2
  was tested by using western blotting. GAPDH was used as the internal standard (*P<0.05,
  vs. the adherent group). (H) Quantitative analysis of (G): H69A was used as the
  control (100%). Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation of three independent
  experiments (*P<0.05). SCLC, small cell lung cancer; GO, Gene Ontology; KEGG, Kyoto
