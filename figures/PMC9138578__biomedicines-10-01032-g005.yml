caption: Empagliflozin regulates Hippo signalling in LX-2 cells. (a) Following different
  doses of EMPA treatment in LX-2 cells for 12 h, the protein levels of MST1, MST2,
  phospho-MST1/2, MOB1, phospho-MOB1, LATS1, and phospho-LATS1 were evaluated via
  Western blot. (b) Statistical analysis on the relative expression of the Hippo pathway
  in LX-2 cells. Data are expressed as means Â± standard deviation of three independent
  experiments. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 compared to the control.
