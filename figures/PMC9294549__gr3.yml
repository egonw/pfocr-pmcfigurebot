caption: Knockdown of Twist1 suppressed the proliferation and metastasis of BLBC.
  Cancer cells were transfected with shTwist1. (A) Western blot measured Twist1 protein
  level. (B-D) CCK-8, colony formation, wound healing experiments detected cell viability,
  proliferation and migration. (E) Transwell assay tested cell migration and invasion.
  Data are the means Â± SD for three independent experiments. *P<0.05, **P<0.01. (For
  interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is
  referred to the web version of this article.)
