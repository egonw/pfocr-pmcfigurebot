caption: Injury type induces differential pulmonary gene expression and associated
  canonical pathway activity. Mice underwent sham, burn, or combined B+I injury, and
  were sacrificed at 24 h post-injury (n = 6 per group). mRNA was extracted from whole
  lung tissue and NanoString analysis performed with a mouse Cancer Immune Panel,
  allowing expression analysis of 770 immune and metabolic genes. (A–C) are volcano
  plots of injury-induced differential gene expression, where red dots signify p <
  0.05 (−log10(p-value) > 1.301). A Venn diagram was constructed (C) to summarize
  the number and identity of genes that are impacted in a unique or common fashion
  to each injury type (when quantified vs. sham). Differential gene expression and
  pathway Z-scores between B+I and burn alone were analyzed via Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis (D,E); only significantly altered (p < 0.5) pathways are shown.
