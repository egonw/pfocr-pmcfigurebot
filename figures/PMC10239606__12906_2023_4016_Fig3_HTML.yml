caption: Effects of RES and MOS on colony formation and cell cycle arrest in lung
  cancer cells. A total of 300 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and then treated
  with RES or MOS at the concentrations indicated in the figure for 24 h. The colonies
  were allowed to grow for 7 days and subjected to crystal violet staining. (A) Colony
  formation in lung cancer cell lines following RES or MOS treatment. (B) Bar graphs
  showed the quantitative results of A. The left part shows the colony number and
  the right part shows colony size. (C) After serum starvation of 48 h, cells were
  treated with RES or MOS, as indicated, for 24 h. DNA content was analyzed by flow
  cytometer using PI staining. The left part shows the summary of percentages of the
  cells in sub-G1, G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases. Each value is the mean (± SD) from triplicate
  experiments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001 vs. control
