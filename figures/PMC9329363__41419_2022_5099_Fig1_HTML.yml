figure_title: ER stress upregulated the expression of ARHGEF2 in HCC cells
caption: A RNA-sequencing, ATAC-sequencing, and Chip-sequencing of TM-treated or untreated
  HepG2 cells were analyzed to find the differentially expressed genes. B A heat map
  was constructed according to the mRNA sequencing results. C qRT-PCR was used to
  detect the expression of differential genes in the TM-treated or untreated HepG2
  cells. D Volcanic map of the ARHGEF2 expression. E, F HepG2 and MHCC97H cells were
  treated with TM or 4-PBA, and the expression of ARHGEF2 was detected by immunofluorescence.
  G, H Changes in ARHGEF2 and the GRP78 protein (G) and mRNA (H) level after the HepG2
  cells were treated with different concentrations of TM. I, J After HepG2 was treated
  with 4-PBA at different concentrations, the protein (I) and the mRNA (J) level of
  ARHGEF2 and GRP78 were detected.
