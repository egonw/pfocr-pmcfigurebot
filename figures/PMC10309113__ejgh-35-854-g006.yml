caption: 'The effect of OE on TNBS-induced apoptotic protein expression and histomorphology
  in rats by the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. (a) Disease activity index (DAI) scores.
  (b) HE staining and histological score for the extent of damage in the rat colon
  (scale bar = 100 µm). (c) HE and TUNEL staining for histomorphological changes in
  rats with UC (scale bar = 100 µm). (d) Western blots for the expression of apoptosis-related
  proteins Bax, Bcl2, and cleaved caspase 3. Compared with the control group, ###P ≤ 0.001;
  compared with the UC group, ***P ≤ 0.001; compared with the OE group, @@P ≤ 0.01,
  @@@P ≤ 0.001.'
