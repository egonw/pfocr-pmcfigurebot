caption: 'MdFLS2-1 positively regulates resistance of apple to AAAP. RT-qPCR analysis
  of the expression level of (A) MdFLS2 and (B) salicylate pathway marker genes MdNPR1,
  MdTGA3, and MdPR1 in leaves of WT, EV, and OE-MdFLS2-1 plants. Asterisks denote
  Student’s t-tests, significance: **P < 0.01. The mean ± SD of biological triplicates
  were taken for every value. (C) Symptoms of infection in leaves of WT, EV, and OE-MdFLS2-1
  plants at 48 h after AAAP inoculation. (D) Incidence statistics of leaves of WT,
  EV, and OE-MdFLS2-1 plants at 48 h after AAAP inoculation. Values are the means
  ± SD of three biological replicates (Student’s t-tests, **P < 0.01).'
article_title: Insertion of a TRIM-like sequence in MdFLS2-1 promoter is associated
  with its allele-specific expression in response to Alternaria alternata in apple.
