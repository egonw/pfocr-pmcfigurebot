caption: The involvement of cytokine-related signaling pathways in colitis-associated
  CRC. (A) Binding of IL-23 to IL-23R activates the downstream JAK/STAT pathway to
  release IL-17A, IL-21, IL-22 from Th17 cells, exerting proinflammatory and protumor
  effects. (B–E) Several factors such as S1P, IL-22, IL-6, VEGF contribute to phosphorylation
  of STAT3 that upregulates Bcl-x and Caspase 3, downregulate Bcl-xl to inhibit apoptosis.
  (F) Kynurenine pathway metabolites rapidly activate PI3K/AKT signaling which then
  promotes β-catenin translocate to the nucleus, where β-catenin can form transcription
  complex with YAP and TCF4. (G–I) Proinflammatory stimuli including TNF-α, IL-1β
  and LPS can participate in tumor initiation and development through boosting the
  downstream molecule NF-κB activity. (J) PGE2 activates PI3K/AKT/PPAR-δ signaling
  to promote cell survival, thus increasing tumor burden.
