caption: LA arrested cells at G1 phase and induced apoptosis of VEGF-stimulated MKN-45
  cells. (a) Flow cytometry assay of cell cycle distribution. (b) The quantitation
  of cell cycle distribution. The data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3). (c) The
  Hoechst 33342-stained nuclei were imaged under laser confocal microscopy. Bar =
  50 μm. Representative photographs of the morphological changes observed. The red
  arrow indicates apoptotic bodies and the white arrows indicate shrunken and deformed
  nuclei of apoptotic cells. (d) Apoptosis of LA-treated VEGF-stimulated MKN-45 cells
  was determined by flow cytometric analysis. (e) The quantitation of cell cycle distribution.
  The data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3). (f) A JC-10 kit was used to measure
  the mitochondrial membrane potential of VEGF-stimulated MKN-45 cells by laser confocal
  microscopy. CCCP staining results were used as the positive control. JC-10 is the
  monomer with green fluorescence, while JC-10 is the polymer with red fluorescence.
  Bar = 100 μm. (g) Cyclin D1, c-Myc, Bcl-2, Bax, Cyt C, caspase 9, and cleaved-caspase
  3 protein expression levels were detected by western blot.
