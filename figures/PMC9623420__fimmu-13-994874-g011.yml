caption: Exploration of the risk signature and drug sensitivity. (A) A total of 1900
  compounds from GDSC, CTRP, and PRISM were screened to investigate promising drugs
  for clinical treatment. (B) In the high- or low-risk groups, different predicted
  IC50 values of drugs in chemotherapy, the RTK pathway, and the ERK/MAPK pathway
  are displayed. (C) Venn diagram showing the two candidate compounds between CTRP
  and PRISM. Niclosamide and chlorambucil are the two compounds predicted with significantly
  lower AUCs in the high-risk group (P adj< 0.05) in CTRP (D) and PRISM (E). GDSC,
  Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer; CTRP, The Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal;
  PRISM, Profiling Relative Inhibition Simultaneously in Mixtures; RTK, receptor tyrosine
  kinase; and ERK/MAPK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein
  kinase.
