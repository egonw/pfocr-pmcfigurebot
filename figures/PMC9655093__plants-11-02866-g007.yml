caption: Expression changes in starch and sucrose metabolism pathway-related differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) in the culm sheath. (A) Schematic diagram of starch and sucrose
  metabolism. (B) Heatmap of differential expression of key enzymes in starch and
  sucrose metabolism. STS, starch synthase; GLGB, 1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme;
  AAM, alpha-amylase; BAM, beta-amylase; HXK, hexokinase; GPI, glucose-6-phosphate
  isomerase; FRK, fructokinase; INV, beta-fructofuranosidase; SUS, sucrose synthase;
  SPS, sucrose-phosphate synthase; TPS, trehalose 6-phosphate synthase/phosphatase;
  TPP, trehalose 6-phosphate phosphatase. (C) RT-qPCR analysis of the expression pattern
  of specific DEGs of starch and sucrose metabolism pathway. The ID name of each DEG
  is placed at the top of the panel. Different letters indicate significant differences
  between the average values of the column (Â±SE, n = 3), p < 0.05.
