caption: Pexmetinib suppressed breast cancer cells metastasis by impairing p38-STAT3-MMPs
  axis. (A) MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with Pexmetinib (4 μM) for 0 h, 6 h, 12 h,
  24 h, and the levels of the indicated proteins were determined by Western blotting.
  (B) The grey levels of p-p38, p-STAT3 were quantified and normalized to total p38,
  STAT3 and β-actin using Image J. (C) MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with Pexmetinib
  (4 μM) in the present with or without Colivelin, and cells migration and invasion
  were determined by transwell assay. (D) Migration and invasion rates were measured
  using Image J and normalized relative to the control group. (E-F) MDA-MB-231 cells
  were treatment with Pexmetinib (4 μM) in the present with or without Colivelin for
  24 h, and the levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were determined by Western blotting. Scale
  bar = 100 μm, *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01. Data are expressed as means ± SEM, n = 5.
