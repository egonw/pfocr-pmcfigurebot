caption: Expression levels of SCAP in macrophages also influences lipid homeostasis
  and inflammatory response of adipocytes in vitro. (A) Schematic diagram of cocultivation
  of 3T3-L1 cells and RAW264.7 cells. (B) Oil Red O staining of LDL-treated 3T3-L1
  cells cocultured with NC-SCAP or OE-SCAP RAW264.7 cells (n = 3). Relative mRNA levels
  of inflammation cytokine (C), lipolysis (D), lipid synthesis (E), and lipid uptake
  (F) in LDL-treated 3T3-L1 cells cocultured with NC-SCAP or OE-SCAP RAW264.7 cells
  (n = 5). (G) Oil Red O staining of LDL-treated 3T3-L1 cells cocultured with Vec-SCAP
  or SCAPi-RAW264.7 cells (n = 3). Relative mRNA levels of inflammation cytokine (H),
  lipolysis (I), lipid synthesis (J), and lipid uptake (K) in LDL-treated 3T3-L1 cells
  cocultured with Vec-SCAP or SCAPi-RAW264.7 cells (n = 5). Data are expressed as
  mean ± SD. ∗P < .05; ∗∗P < .01; ∗∗∗P < .0001; ns, nonsignificant (2-tailed unpaired
  t test in bar graphs).
