caption: 'Downregulation of IL-32 expression attenuates H/R-induced viability reduction,
  LDH release and oxidative stress. (A) IL-32 siRNA was constructed and the cells
  were transfected with siRNA to downregulate IL-32 levels. The expression levels
  of IL-32 in the cells were verified with RT-qPCR and (B) western blot assays. (C)
  The expression levels of IL-32 in the H/R-treated cells were verified with RT-qPCR
  and (D) western blot assays. (E) The effects of the downregulation of IL-32 expression
  on cell viability were evaluated using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. (F) The effects
  of the downregulation of IL-32 expression on LDH levels were evaluated using the
  LDH assay kit. The levels of (G) MDA, (H) SOD and (I) ROS in each group were assessed
  using specific assay kits. **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs. control, siRNA-NC or H/R
  + siRNA-NC; #P<0.05, ##P<0.01 and ###P<0.001 vs. H/R + siRNA-NC. IL, interleukin;
  H/R, hypoxia and reoxygenation; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; siRNA, small interfering
  RNA; RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR; MDA, malondialdehyde; SOD,
  superoxide dismutase; ROS, reactive oxygen species.'
