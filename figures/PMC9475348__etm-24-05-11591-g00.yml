caption: Identification of HPL-MSCs. (A) Representative photomicrograph of adherent
  cells on plastic cell culture dish. (B) Flow cytometry determined the expression
  of CD29, CD73, CD105, CD34, CD45, HLA-DR and CD14 in HPL-MSCs. The blue line and
  the red line represent the isotype control and the level of surface markers, respectively.
  The x-axis represents the fluorescence signal value and the y-axis represents counts.
  (C) HPL-MSCs showed multiple differentiation potentials. The experiments were representative
  of at least three independent trials, each with three technical replicates. Magnification,
  x10. HPL-MSC, human placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cell; CD, cluster of differentiation;
  HLA-DR, human leukocyte antigen-DR isotype.
