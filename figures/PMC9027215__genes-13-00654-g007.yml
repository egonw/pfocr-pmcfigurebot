caption: 'Enrichment analysis. (A) GO enrichment analysis of 693 module genes obtained
  from WGCNA. The enrichment results are carried out from three aspects: biological
  process (BP), cellular component (CC), and molecular function (MF). (B) The 693
  module genes obtained from WGCNA were analyzed by KEGG enrichment analysis. The
  x−axis of each part of a−b is the proportion of genes enriched in this pathway of
  the total analyzed genes. The different size of the dot represents the number of
  genes enriched in the pathway, and the color of the dot represents the p value.
  p < 0.05 is regarded as statistically significant. (C) Enrichment analysis of 150
  genes expression, which were similar to hub genes expression pattern. Each column
  bar on the y−axis represents an enrichment pathway, and the x-axis is the significance.'
