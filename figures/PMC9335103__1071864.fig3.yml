caption: 'Differences in genomic instability score, homologous recombination deficiency
  score and ploidy across different disease groups. Segmentation output data from
  OncoScan microarray (n=77 cases; ENKTL=34, PTCL-EBV=14, PTCL-NOS=29) was analyzed
  and quantified for scores of (A) GI, (B) LOH-HRD, LST-HRD, AIL-HRD and scaled HRD
  and (C) ploidy. (D) Comparison of GI- and HRD- scores across different cancer groups
  also profiled via OncoScan. Oncoscan datasets on T-cell lymphomas were unavailable.
  Wide variation of GI- and HRD- scores was observed across cancer types with HNSCC
  having highest scores while CML and pFL had lowest. High-grade lymphomas, such as
  Burkitt-like lymphomas, large B-cell lymphomas, ENKTL and PTCLNOS had higher GI-
  and HRD-scores than low-grade lymphomas. Our results showed that PTCL-EBV exhibited
  significantly lower GI- and HRD- scores among aggressive lymphomas and various solid
  tumors. Statistical significance was determined using Kruskal-Wallis tests for differences
  among the three disease groups while Mann-Whitney U tests were used for pairwise
  comparisons. LOH: loss of heterozygosity; LST: large-scale state transitions; AIL:
  telomere allelic imbalance; BL: Burkitt-like; CML: chronic myeloid leukemia; ESCC:
  esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; HNSCC: head and neck squamous cell carcinoma;
  LBC: large B-cell; LNMCC: lymph node metastases in colon cancer; OTC: oral tongue
  carcinoma; pFL: pediatric-type follicular lymphoma; RCC: renal cell carcinoma; SCC:
  synchronous colorectal cancer; HRD: homologous recombination deficiency.'
