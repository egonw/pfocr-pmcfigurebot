figure_title: Regulatory and unifying mechanisms of noncanonical autophagy activation
caption: An overview of the known mechanisms regulating noncanonical autophagy and
  CASM. Different stimuli converge to alter the ionic balance and pH of the target
  endolysosomal vesicle. LAP and LANDO depend on Vps34/Rubicon-mediated activation
  of NOX2 to induce ROS production, which consumes protons and raises pH. Multiple
  stimuli, including viroporins, ionophores, PFTs, lysosomotropic drugs, TRPML1 agonists,
  and STING agonists, all lead to alterations in luminal ion balances and pH independent
  of Rubicon and ROS. Endolysosomal pH perturbations are sensed through unknown mechanisms
  and lead to increased association of V0-V1 subunits of the V-ATPase complex. Increased
  V0-V1 association drives VAIL (V-ATPase–ATG16L1–induced LC3 lipidation) and the
  recruitment of the ATG16L1 complex through the C-terminal WD40 domain. The autophagy-related
  ubiquitin-like conjugation systems then target ATG8 proteins for lipidation to PE
  or PS on the endolysosomal membrane. Pathway inhibitors are in red text, and activators
  are in blue text. Figure generated using Biorender.com
