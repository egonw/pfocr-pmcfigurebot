figure_title: The 85-90 IFITM3 mutant does not colocalize with CD63, LAMP2, nor with
  the ER
caption: HEK293T cells ectopically expressing the indicated IFITM3s, or co-transfected
  with the ER reporter D1ER were analyzed by confocal microscopy with the indicated
  markers. Whiskers and boxes plot of the Pearson’s colocalization coefficients (25–75
  percentiles with individual cells represented as dots; n = 16 to 38 per condition
  in three independent experiments). A one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons
  test was applied for each marker to evaluate differences in localization between
  WT and 85-90 IFITM3 mutant (nonstatistical significant differences are represented
  by white boxes; P < 0.0001 by colored ones). Source data are provided in the relevant
  section.

  and reveals a regulatory role of IFITM3 on the secretory pathway.
