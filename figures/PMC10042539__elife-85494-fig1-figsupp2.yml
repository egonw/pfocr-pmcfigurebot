figure_title: Cancer cells will macrophage mitochondria exhibit increased proliferation
caption: (a) Cancer cells and macrophages were cocultured for 24 hours and scRNA-seq
  was performed. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of scRNA-seq data reveals significant
  changes in canonical cell proliferation pathways in co-cultured cancer cells that
  received macrophage mitochondria compared to co-cultured cancer cells that did not.
  (b) Representative flow cytometry plots of mito-RFP 231/mito-mEm macrophage co-cultures
  stained for Ki67 and DNA content. (c) 24 hr data from  but separated as percent
  of cancer cells in each phase of the cell cycle with (triangle) or without transfer
  (circle). (d) 48 hr of co-culture as described in (c) with aggregate data in stacked
  bar graphs to the right (stats displayed for G2/M only). Each pair in (c) and (d)
  represents cells within one technical replicate and each donor is represented by
  color (N = 4 donors for both data sets). (e) Time-lapse imaging was used to quantify
  the amount of co-cultured 231 cells that did (black) or did not complete (gray)
  cytokinesis over a 48-hr period (N = 416 cells, 4 donors). Error bars represent
  SEM. Two-way ANOVA (c–e), ***p<0.001; ****p<0.0001.
