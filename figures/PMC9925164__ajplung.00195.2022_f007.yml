caption: 'Immunosuppressant cyclosporine A (CsA) rescues pulmonary dysplasia by activating
  the Wnt signaling pathway. A: representative hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining
  of lung tissues from sham, pulmonary artery (PA) banding (PAB), or CsA-treated rats.
  B: quantification of mean linear intercept (MLI). n = 50 slides from five lungs.
  C: representative Von Willebrand factor (vWF) staining of lung tissues from sham,
  PAB, or CsA-treated rats. vWF (green), DAPI (blue). D: quantification of vWF intensity
  of lung tissues. n = 50 slides from five lungs. E: representation of whole lungs
  from sham, PAB, or CsA-treated rats. F: quantification of the lung volume from sham,
  PAB, or CsA-treated rats. n = 5 lungs. G: representative alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells
  from PAB and CsA-treated lungs. Surfactant protein C (Sftpc, red), DAPI (blue).
  H: quantification of Sftpc intensity. n = 50 slides from five lungs. I: representative
  Wnt3a/β-catenin blot from sham, PAB, or CsA-treated rats. J: quantification of Wnt3a.
  n = 5 samples. K: quantification of β-catenin. n = 5 samples.'
