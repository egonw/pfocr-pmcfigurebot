caption: 'miRNAs involved in CAC-associated canonical signaling pathways. In the development
  of CAC, major signaling pathways involve the upregulation and downregulation of
  several miRNAs. miRNA upregulation leads to the increased expression of proinflammatory
  cytokines, morphological changes, and increased epithelial barrier permeability.
  Feedback contributes to CAC progression by further exacerbating these changes. After
  activation of the proinflammatory state, these associated changes go back and stimulate
  miRNAs to create positive feedback mechanisms. The loss of major downregulated miRNAs
  leads to increased proinflammatory pathway activation, leading to the compounding
  effects of inflammation on accelerating tumor development. Black arrow: activation.
  Brown arrow: positive feedback. Created with Biorender.com.'
