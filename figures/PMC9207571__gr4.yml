caption: Peripheral IL-10 or TGFβ signaling pathway does not regulate the number of
  CGRP-R and PACAP-R TG neurons at basal level or after repeated NTG administration.
  (A) Time line of the experiment in B-D. Data from individual experimental groups
  in , ,  were collected in parallel but plotted separately for clarity. (B) The percentages
  of CGRP-R neurons in TG cultures from female Swiss Webster mice after repeated injections
  of vehicle, NTG as well as neutralizing antibodies against IL-10 or TGFβ (n = 3–6
  mice/group). The number of neurons in each group is indicated in the figure. ***p < 0.001,
  χ2 test followed by post hoc Fisher’s exact test with Bonferroni correction. (C)
  The percentages of PACAP-R neurons in TG cultures from vehicle- or NTG-treated mice
  (same neurons as in B). ***p < 0.001, χ2 test followed by post hoc Fisher’s exact
  test with Bonferroni correction. (D) Venn diagrams of the percentages of CGRP-R
  and PACAP-R neurons in each group (same neurons as in B).
