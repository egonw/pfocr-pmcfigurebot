caption: Identification of DEGs associated with G2M checkpoint. (A) Cell types annotation
  of sc-RNA dataset GSE159115. (B) Distribution of G2M checkpoint pathway in sc-RNA
  dataset GSE159115. (C) G2M checkpoint pathway enrichment analyzed by GSEA. (D, E)
  Volcano and heatmap plots of G2M checkpoint-related genes, respectively. A deeper
  shade of red signifies a more pronounced positive correlation, while a deeper shade
  of blue signifies a more pronounced negative correlation. (For interpretation of
  the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web
  version of this article.)
