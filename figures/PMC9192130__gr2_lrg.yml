caption: PDCoV infection activates the ATF6 pathway. (A–C) LLC-PK1 cells were mock-infected
  or infected with PDCoV (MOI = 5) for 3, 6, 9, or 12 h. Cellular total RNA was extracted
  and subjected to quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis for the detection of GRP78,
  GRP94, and calreticulin mRNA. Mock-infected and TG-treated LLCPK1 cells were used
  as negative and positive controls, respectively. (D) PDCoV-infected LLC-PK1 cells
  were harvested at 3, 6, 9, or 12 h and subjected to western blot analysis for the
  detection of GRP78, GRP94, and PDCoV N protein. Target protein expression was quantitatively
  estimated by ImageJ software and presented as the density value relative to that
  of the β-actin. The presented results are the means and standard deviations of data
  from three independent experiments. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ns, nonsignificant
  difference.
