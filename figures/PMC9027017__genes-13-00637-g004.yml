caption: 'Heat map view of JAK2 paring with additional MNAMs in 7 PV patients cohort
  reports (). (A) Heat map representation of JAK2/affected pathway association with
  another MNAM that belongs to one of the 5 affected pathways (e.g., the triple association
  of JAK2 + one of epigenetic affected gene + one of intracellular signaling affected
  gene is found in 20 cases among the total of 175 cases affected by a JAK2/Epigenetic
  association). The numbers above each colon represent the total cases of each JAK2/affected
  pathway (e.g., association of JAK2 + one of epigenetic affected gene is found in
  175 cases). (B) Heat map representation of JAK2/affected gene with another MNAM
  (e.g., the triple association of JAK2 + TET2 + ASXL1 is found in 9 cases among the
  101 cases affected by a JAK2/TET2 association.). The numbers above each colon represent
  the total cases of each JAK2/MNAM association (e.g., association of JAK2 + TET2
  is found in 101 cases). Abbreviation: Alt. splicing = Alternative splicing; Epi.
  = Epigenetic; Intra. sign. = Intracellular signaling; Trans. factor = Transcription
  factor.'
