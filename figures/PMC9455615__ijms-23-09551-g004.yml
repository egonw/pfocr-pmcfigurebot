caption: 'Functional microbiomes modulate ROS-induced keratinocyte apoptosis via dual
  AhR/Nrf2 signaling and induce epidermal terminal differentiation. (a) Heatmap showing
  AhR signaling, Nrf2 signaling, and skin barrier-related genes stratified by SA abundance.
  (b) Measurement of mRNA levels of AhR, ARNT, CYP1A1, and PTGS2 relative to 18S rRNA.
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 compared to control group (HaCaT). # p <
  0.05, ### p < 0.001 between S. hominis R9 and C. avidum R-CH3. (c) Measurement of
  mRNA levels of NFE2L2, NQO1, and HMOX1 relative to 18S rRNA. ** p < 0.01, *** p
  < 0.001 compared to control group (HaCaT). ### p < 0.001 between S. hominis R9 and
  C. avidum R-CH3. (d) Boxplots of gene expression values for FLG, LOR, and CLDN1
  stratified by an abundance of C. avidum in the Pso cohort. ** p < 0.01 between S.
  hominis R9 and C. avidum R-CH3. (e) Measurement of mRNA levels of AHR, CYP1A1, NFE2L2,
  and OVOL1 relative to 18S rRNA in SA and SA and C. avidum treated groups with or
  without AHR gene silencing in HaCaT cells. *** p < 0.001 compared to each si-control
  group. (f) Measurement of mRNA levels of FLG, LOR, IVL, and CLDN1 relative to 18S
  rRNA in SA and SA and C. avidum treated groups with or without AHR gene silencing
  in HaCaT cells. *** p < 0.001, ns: not-significant compared to each si-control group.
  ### p < 0.001 between SA treatment group and C. avidum R-CH3 treatment group after
  SA treatment in AHR-silenced HaCaT cells. Statistical significance was calculated
  using Bonferroni tests.'
