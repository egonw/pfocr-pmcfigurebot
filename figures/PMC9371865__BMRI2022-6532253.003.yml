caption: LTBP2 regulates the expressions of ferroptosis biomarkers. (a, b) ROS levels
  were significantly increased after LTBP2 knockout. (c, d) Suppression of LTBP2 could
  reduce mitochondrial membrane potential. (e) MDA levels were increased in GC cells
  when LTBP2 was suppressed. (f–h) The expression levels of 4-HNE and PTGS2 were increased
  after LTBP2 knockout. Quantitative data are presented as mean s ± SD from three
  independent experiments. ∗P < 0.01 vs. the control.
