caption: Analysis of c-Met pathway involvement in HGF-mediated MDA-MB-231 colony branching
  (A). Representative colony photographs of 3D matrigel cultures, HGF and HGF with
  capmatinib treatment on the left panel, conditioned media (CM) from ERα36high (CAF4)
  culture and capmatinib treatment on the right panel, 10× magnification, capmatinib
  significantly inhibited colony branching induced by HGF as well as by CAF4-CM (B).
  Graphs representing data from 3D matrigel cultures, ** p < 0.005 between HGF or
  CAF4-conditioned media treatment and addition of capmatinib (C). Western blot analysis
  of c-Met-signaling pathway after HGF and CAF4-CM treatment at different times (15–60
  min), with or without capmatinib treatment. Activation of c-Met receptor and Akt
  was inhibited after capmatinib treatment. (D) Densitometry measurements of protein
  phosphorylation as a ratio between phosphorylated to total protein signal.
