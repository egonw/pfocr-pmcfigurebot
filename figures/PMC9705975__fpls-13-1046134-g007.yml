caption: Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) and dual‐luciferase reporter assays showing the association
  of DhMYB2 and DhbHLH1 with promoters of ABP structural genes. The Y1HGold yeast
  stains harboring the promoter reporter were transformed with empty plasmid as negative
  control (A), effector DhMYB2 (B), or effector DhbHLH1 (C), respectively. Interaction
  was detected based on the ability of transformed stains to grow on SD medium lacking
  Leu and Ura in the presence of 300 or 400 ng/mL AbA. (D) Luciferase activity in
  tobacco leaves was detected 3 days after infiltration. Firefly luciferase (LUC)
  activities were normalized against Renilla luciferase (REN) activities. Graphs are
  presented as mean ± SEM from three biological replicates. Different letters indicate
  significant differences (p < 0.05, Duncan’s multiple range tests). (E) Schematic
  representation of the suggested role of DhMYB2 and DhbHLH1 in ABP. Metabolic enzymes
  involved in the pathway are indicated. DhMYB2 and DhbHLH1 binding to promoter of
  LBGs act as activators in ABP.
