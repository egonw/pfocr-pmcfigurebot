caption: Effects of low temperatures on the abscission of cotton leaves treated with
  TDZ under different temperatures. (A) Representative images of cotton plants treated
  with thidiazuron (TDZ) or water (control) taken at 24, 72, and 96 h after treatment
  under 25 °C, and at 24, 144, 192, and 288 h after treatment under 15 °C; (B) defoliation
  rate (%) of cotton leaves at different time points after treatment. Error bars represent
  the SD of three biological replicates; (C) paraffin section observation of cotton
  AZs at 72 h after treatment under 25 °C and at 192 h after treatment under 15 °C.
  Scale bars are 200 µm. Cotton seedlings with the fifth true leaf fully expanded
  were used in the experiments.
