caption: 'G3BP1 promoted cell proliferation, migration and invasion by up-regulating
  phosphoration of STAT3. (A and B) The differential expression genes were identified
  in HNE2 and HONE1 cells after knockdown or overexpression of G3BP1, and potential
  molecular mechanisms were suspected by GSEA and KEGG analysis. (C) G3BP1 could regulate
  the expression of p-STAT3 positively, and the downstream proteins of STAT3 signaling
  were also regulated. The Akt/mTOR signaling was also regulated by G3BP1. (D and
  E) Stattic was used to recover the cell growth of HNE2 and 5-8F with overexpression
  of G3BP1 (CCK8 assay and clone formation). Note: (1) Control+DMSO, (2) G3BP1+DMSO,
  (3) G3BP1+Stattic, (4) Control+DMSO, (5) G3BP1+DMSO, (6) G3BP1+Stattic. (F) Stattic
  might reverse the migration rates in wound healing assay of HNE2 cells with overexpression
  of G3BP1. (G) Stattic might recover the invasion rates in matrigel invasion assay
  of HNE2 and 5-8F with overexpression of G3BP1. (H) p-STAT3 was up-regulated by overexpression
  of G3BP1, which could be recovered by stattic.'
