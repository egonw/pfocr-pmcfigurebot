caption: 'Anti-inflammatory effects on HCl/EtOH-induced gastritis model. (A) Schematic
  diagram of an experiment using the acute gastritis model. ICR mice were separated
  into a total of five groups and were orally administered three times 100 μL of the
  drug corresponding to each group: a normal group and a negative control group (0.5%
  carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)), treatment groups (100 mg/kg Pp-EE or 150 mg/kg Pp-EE),
  or positive control group (40 mg/kg ranitidine). Five hours after the last dose,
  mice were orally administrated 200 mM HCl/60% EtOH (300 μL/mouse) to induce acute
  gastritis and sacrificed after 1 h. (B,C) Dissected stomachs were photographed,
  and the incidence of lesions was quantified using ImageJ. (D) Comparison of mRNA
  expression of inflammatory genes (COX-2 (Left panel), IL-6 (Middle panel), and TNF-α
  (Right panel)) in the stomach was conducted using real-time PCR (E,F) The protein
  levels in the stomach were detected by an immunoblotting assay. ###: p < 0.001 and
  ##: p < 0.01 compared to the normal group, *: p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01, and ***: p
  < 0.001 compared to the control group. −: no treatment and +: treatment.'
