caption: Arid1a Modulates Il1a Expression and Affects Neuronal Differentiation of
  neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs). (A) Top 20 pathway analysis based on KEGG
  database revealing the differentially expressed genes (p < 0.05, log2foldchange >1.5)
  in cKO microglia were enriched for multiple cellular biological processes, count
  means number of genes involved in the specific pathway. (B) Cellular secretion‐related
  KEGG pathway gene network analysis, including cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction,
  inflammatory bowel disease, cellular senescence and haematopoietic cell lineage.
  Size means number of genes involved in the specific pathway, the black arrow points
  to the genes involved in all these pathways above, including Il6 and Il1a. (C).
  Genome‐browser view of RNA‐seq (n = 3), ChIP‐seq (n = 1), and ATAC‐seq (n = 2) at
  Il1a and Il1b, the green rectangle was used for pointing out the peak gain. (D)
  NSPCs differentiation using microglia and NSPCs contactless culture system and 0.4 μm
  trans well were used. For NSPCs differentiation, 20,000 cKO or WT microglia were
  seeded on the upper side of the trans well membrane and 100,000 NSCs from WT mice
  were seeded on the lower side, and specific antibodies for Tuj1 and GFAP were used
  for analysis of NSPCs differentiation. (E) Quantification of Tuj1and GFAP positive
  cells (n = 3). (F) Il1a‐stimulated NSPCs differentiation. Left, representative images
  of Tuj1 and GFAP staining. Right, quantification of Tuj1and GFAP positive cells
  (n = 3). Data are expressed as mean ± SEM and analysed by Student's t‐test from
  at least three independent experiments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ****p < 0.0001
