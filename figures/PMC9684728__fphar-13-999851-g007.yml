caption: 'DIM enhances autophagy levels by modulating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
  pathway (A,B) Compared to the LPS + DIM group, the addition of PI3K activator (740Y-P)
  after treatment triggered a reduction in the level of autophagy, while the addition
  of PI3K inhibitor LY294002 increased the level of autophagy. Levels of autophagic
  marker proteins (beclin-1, p62, and LC3 II) were measured by western blotting and
  quantitation (C) The fluorescence intensity of LC3 II was detected by immunofluorescence
  staining (scale bar, 20 µm) (D) The fluorescence intensity was measured with the
  ImageJ software (U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda) (E) The number of
  chondrocytes autophagosomes was observed by MDC staining (punctate green staining
  represents autophagosomes; scale bar, 20 μm; partially enlarged image scale bar,
  10 µm) (F) Microstructural detection of autophagosomes by transmission electron
  microscopy (White arrows indicate the formation of autophagosomes. Scale bar = 2 µm;
  partially enlarged image scale bar, 500 nm). The data are presented as mean ± SD
  values from three independent experiments. Using one-way ANOVA, NS, no statistical
  difference; #p < 0.05 vs. the LPS group; # #p < 0.01 vs. the LPS group; * p < 0.05
  vs. the LPS + DIM group; ** p < 0.01 vs. the LPS + DIM group.'
