caption: BCL‐2 mRNA and proteins in kidney tissue. (a) BCL‐2 mRNA. The values for
  mRNA levels are expressed as fold change relative to the wild‐type (WT) control
  group. Each value represents the mean ± SEM of triplicate combinations from 4 mice
  per group. Data were analyzed by two‐way ANOVA. a–c mean values with different letters
  are significantly different. (b) Representative immunoblots of the BCL‐2 proteins.
  The protein bands represent samples from individual kidneys. The relative optic
  densities (ODs) were calculated by normalizing the ODs of BCL‐2 to the OD for β‐tubulin
  in the same sample. Data are presented as mean ± SEM from 3 mice/group. (c) Immunohistochemical
  staining for BCL‐2 in tubules. (d) Immunostaining staining for BCL‐2 in renal corpuscle
  of kidney tissue. Ten non‐overlapping fields for tubular and 10 non‐overlapping
  fields of renal corpuscle sections were imaged at 60× magnification from each kidney
  section (n = 3 mice/group) and analyzed in a blinded manner. a–c mean values with
  different letters are significantly different (p < 0.01). (e) Immunolocalization
  of BCL‐2 proteins. Villin (green) was used as a PT marker and the DAPI (blue) was
  used to stain the nuclei. There were significant increases in BCL‐2 mRNA levels
  for both genotypes at 24 h post‐IR. However, BCL‐2 proteins increased only in βKO
  kidneys subjected to IR.
