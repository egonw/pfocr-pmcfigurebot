caption: LncRNA H19 functions as miRNA sponges in HCC. (A) LncRNA H19 sponged miRNA-22,
  promoting the development of HCC. (B) LncRNA H19 sponged miR-326, thus increasing
  the expression of TWIST1, eventually promoting the development of HCC. (C) LncRNA
  H19 sponged miR-15b, thus activating the CDC42/PAK1 signaling pathway, promoting
  the development of HCC. (D) LncRNA H19 sponged miR-520a-3p, thus increasing the
  expression of LIMK1, eventually promoting the development of HCC. (E) LncRNA H19
  sponged miR-193b, thus increasing the expression of MAPK1, eventually promoting
  the development of HCC. (F) LncRNA H19 sponged miR-200b-3p, thus upregulating the
  expression of zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), eventually promoting
  the development of HCC.
