caption: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of HD and RBS89 plants with or without
  inoculation identified from RNA-seq data. (A) Heatmap showing the upregulated or
  downregulated DEGs between HD and RBS89 plants with or without inoculation. The
  scaling of each gene was to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 2.0. (B) Venn
  diagram analysis showed 4,295 DEGs between the HD and RBS89 plants with or without
  inoculation. (C) GO enrichment analysis of the DEGs. (D) KEGG pathway analysis of
  the DEGs.
