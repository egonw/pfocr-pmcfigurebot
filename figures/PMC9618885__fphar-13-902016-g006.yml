caption: The mechanism of SMS2 inhibitors in inhibiting IL-4-induced M2 polarization.
  (A). The expression of IL-4Rα is positively correlated with SMS2 in pancreatic cancer.
  Immunoblotting was used to detect the expression of IL-4Rαand downstream proteins
  in BMDM (B and C) and THP-1 (E and F) with or without YE2 48 h after IL-4 stimulation.
  The densitometry analysis data of BMDM (B and C) and THP-1 (E and F) was showed.
  Realtime PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression of IL-4Rα in BMDMs (D) and THP-1
  (G) 24 h after IL-4 stimulation. The results are shown as the mean ± SD. *p < 0.05;
  **p < 0.01.
