caption: Pathway enrichment analysis. (A) Bar graph of enriched pathways across input
  gene lists, the top 20 clusters are arranged according to the degree of significance
  (P-value). (B) Network of the top 20 enriched pathways. The members with the best
  P-value from each of the 20 clusters were selected with the constraint that there
  are not >15 members per cluster and not >250 terms in total. Each node represents
  an enriched member and is colored accordingly. GO, Gene Ontology; HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible
  factor 1; PID, primary immunodeficiency.
