caption: Pathway analysis of the genes being up-regulated in all chemerin (huChem-157)-treated
  ovarian cancer cell lines after 48 h as assessed with Affymetrix Clariom S human
  microarrays. All genes with elevated transcript levels (red) are type I interferon
  response genes, mostly induced by IFNÎ±-triggered assembly of upstream regulator
  and transcription factor complex ISGF3, consisting of IRF9 and STAT1/2 (ISGF3 effects
  are not shown here). Also indicated is the cellular localization of the gene products.
  Broken arrows indicate transcriptional activation, other arrows protein interaction.
  The intensity of red color represents the measured grade of transcript up-regulation
  after chemerin treatment (Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) software, Qiagen).
