caption: 'Pathological changes in the lung tissues. A: Lung sections were stained
  with hematoxylin and eosin 6 hours after LPS administration. LPS destroyed the lung
  tissues, resulting in hemorrhage (), inflammatory cell infiltration (), alveolar
  wall thickening () and so on, which were all attenuated by NBDP pretreatment; B:
  NBDP pretreatment significantly alleviated these pathological changes; C: NBDP pretreatment
  significantly alleviated pulmonary edema. Data were expressed as mean ± SD (n=6).

  N-NBD. %P<0.05 compared with L-NBD.'
