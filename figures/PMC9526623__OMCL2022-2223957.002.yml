caption: 'SKQ1 inhibits ferroptosis induced by cisplatin in mouse kidney. (a) Signaling
  pathway expression levels from samples of vehicle+CDDP and vehicle were calculated
  with KEGG analysis. (b) KEGG-pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes
  (DEGs) between the SKQ1+CDDP and vehicle+CDDP groups revealed that ferroptosis was
  one of the most downregulated signaling pathways (indicated by the red box). (c)
  A heat map of gene expression differences portrays the expressed correlations in
  samples among vehicle, vehicle+CDDP, and SKQ1+CDDP groups. (d) Results of the GSEA
  revealed that ferroptosis was upregulated in the vehicle+CDDP group compared to
  the vehicle group but that SKQ1 treatment markedly reduced ferroptosis compared
  to the vehicle+CDDP group. The expression levels of the ferroptotic regulators (e)
  GPX4 and (f) ACSL4 after treatment were evaluated by qPCR. Data are expressed as
  mean ± SD (n = 6 per group). CDDP: cisplatin. ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, and
  ∗∗P < 0.01 (by one-way ANOVA).'
