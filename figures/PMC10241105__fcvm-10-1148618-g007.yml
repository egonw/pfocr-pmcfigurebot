caption: Gene regulatory networks of upregulated miRNAs after postnatal day 9. Chord
  diagrams showing negative regulation of GO biological processes (A) and KEGG pathways
  (B) by target genes of upregulated miRNAs. The enrichment of the target genes of
  each miRNA with the GO biological processes and KEGG pathways (p ≤ 0.05) are presented
  with a single color in the chord diagrams. The size of the section representing
  each GO term or KEGG pathway is proportional to the number of target genes associated
  with the corresponding GO term or KEGG pathway.
