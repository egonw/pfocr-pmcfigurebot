caption: BCP-induced activation of spinal JAK2/STAT3 signaling is dependent on CXCR1
  in vivo and in vitro. (a–c) The phosphorylated proteins of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway
  were time-dependently increased in the spinal cord of rats with BCP. *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, compared to sham group, one-way ANOVA. (d–f) Phosphorylated
  proteins of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway were reduced after intrathecal injection of CXCR1-siRNA.
  *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001, compared to sham group, one-way ANOVA. (g–i) Phosphorylated
  protein of JAK2/STAT3 was dependent on CXCR1 activation in PC12 cells. *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
