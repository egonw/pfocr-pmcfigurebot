caption: Effects of early life PCB 126 exposure on bacteria community, gene expression,
  and metabolism. (A) Relative abundance of cecal bacteria from genus that significantly
  changed from mice with vehicle or PCB 126 exposure. (B) Analysis of KEGG pathway
  abundance that significantly changed in the cecal microbiota from mice with vehicle
  or PCB 126 exposure. (C) Metabolic network changes in cecal bacteria from mice with
  vehicle or PCB 126 exposure. (D,E) NMR analysis of cecal short-chain fatty acids
  (SCFAs) (D) and urine hippurate (E) from mice with vehicle or PCB 126 exposure.
  (F) Serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels from mice with vehicle or PCB 126 exposure.
  Values are means ± S.D. (n = 6 per group). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001,
  **** p < 0.0001 compared to vehicle.
