figure_title: Consequences of HDAC6 activity inhibition regulation through TubA treatment
  in DMD mice model
caption: HDAC6 inhibitor such as TubA induces a decrease in HDAC6 activity that leads
  to an acetylation of α-tubulin and of Smad3. HDAC6 pharmacological inhibition allows
  an increase of α-tubulin acetylation to restore DGC and stabilize MT network/NMJ
  organization. Additionally, specific inhibition of HDAC6 increases acetylation of
  Smad3 which can interfere with TGF-β signaling to both reduce muscle atrophy by
  reducing the expression of key actors such as MAFbx/MuRF1 and to stimulate protein
  synthesis via mTOR pathway. Our results identify HDAC6 as a pharmacological target
  of interest for DMD.
