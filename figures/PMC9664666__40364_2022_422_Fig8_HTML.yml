caption: 'Upregulated MAD2 expression predicted poor prognosis in HCC and hub gene
  analysis positively related to both SGOL2 and MAD2. A MAD2 mRNA level is higher
  in HCC tissues than that in normal liver tissues (UALCAN). B MAD2 has a positive
  relation with SGOL2 in HCC (GEPIA). C Highly expressed MAD2 predicted poor prognosis
  in HCC. D Forty-seven genes positively correlated with both SGOL2 and MAD2, as shown
  by Venn diagram analysis. E The interaction network of the 47 genes. F KEGG enrichment
  of the 47 genes. G The graph shows the interaction network of the top 15 hub genes.
  H-I GO analysis and KEGG enrichment of the top 15 hub genes. HR: hazard ratio. J
  The role and mechanism of SGOL2 in HCC cells. SGOL2 forms a SGOL2-MAD2 complex and
  further regulates MAD2, resulting in dysregulation of the cell cycle and finally
  enhancing HCC malignant behaviors'
article_title: SGOL2 is a novel prognostic marker and fosters disease progression
  via a MAD2-mediated pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma.
