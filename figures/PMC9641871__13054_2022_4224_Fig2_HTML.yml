caption: Steroid profile at baseline (b) and 60 min (p) after corticotropin (Synacthen®)
  in severe sepsis without shock and healthy individuals. 11-Desoxycorticosterone
  at baseline and after stimulation was elevated in severe sepsis compared to healthy
  individuals (p < 0.01 Mann–Whitney test). Corticosterone at baseline did not differ
  between the groups. After stimulation with corticotropin (Synacthen®), corticosterone
  was significantly lower in sepsis (p < 0.0001). No differences were found for 17-OH-Progesterone
  (b and p). 11-Desoxycortisol (b and p) and cortisol (b and p) were significantly
  elevated in sepsis patients compared to healthy individuals indicating a shift toward
  cortisol synthesis in severe sepsis (all p < 0.0001). Cortisone at baseline was
  significantly lower in sepsis (p < 0.01) but not after stimulation with corticotropin.
  In severe sepsis, steroid profiling in combination with corticotropin testing showed
  activation of the glucocorticoid pathway and, in the mineralocorticoid pathway,
  an attenuated corticosterone biosynthesis despite high concentrations of its precursor
