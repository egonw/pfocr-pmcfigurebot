caption: The effects of IL1β overexpression and inhibitors of the IL1β pathway on
  migration and invasion of E0771 and Py8119 breast cancer cells in vitro. (A,B) Effects
  of overexpression of IL1β (IL1B+), overexpression of IL1R1 (IL1R1+), inhibition
  of IL1β (12ng/mL MLX01), inhibition of Caspase-1 (25 ng/mL VRT043198), inhibition
  of IL1R (0.1 mg/kg Anakinra) on cell migration of wide type E0771 and Py8119 cells.
  Data are presented as the percent of scratch closure following 24 h and 48 h in
  culture, normalised for the beginning of scratch. Representative images of cells
  at 48 h are shown where the yellow and blue lines are scratch edges at 0 h and 48
  h, respectively. (C,D) The effects of alteration of IL1β signalling on migration
  and invasion towards pre-osteoblast for 24 h (OB1 cells). All experiments are from
  three biological experiments and their graphs represent mean + SD, * p < 0.05, **
  p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
