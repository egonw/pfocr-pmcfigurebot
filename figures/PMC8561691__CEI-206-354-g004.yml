caption: Interleukin (IL)‐27 signal might be a key factor in rheumatoid arthritis
  (RA) serum‐activated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway of B cells. (A)
  CD19+ B cells were sorted with magnetic beads from peripheral blood mononuclear
  cells (PBMCs) of healthy controls (HC) and cultured with RPMI‐1640 supplemented
  2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2% serum from RA patients or HC in the presence of
  anti‐CD40/CpG for 24 h. The levels of phosphorylated (p)‐mTOR (a), p‐P70S6K (b)
  and p‐4E‐BP1 (c) on CD19+ B cells were detected with flow cytometry assay (n = 5).
  (B) The differences of serum 440 inflammatory molecules in RA patients relative
  to HC were depicted with the volcano plot, where the x‐axis represents the adjusted
  p‐value and the y‐axis represents the fold change of 440 inflammatory molecules
  in RA patients relative to HC. (C) Interleukin (IL)‐27 levels in RA patients (n = 149)
  and HC (n = 64) were detected with enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay.
  (D) CD19+ B cells were sorted with magnetic beads from HC PBMCs and cultured with
  RPMI‐1640 supplemented 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2% RA serum with or without
  anti‐IL‐27 neutralizing antibody in the presence of anti‐CD40/CpG for 24 h, and
  the expressions of p‐mTOR (a), p‐P70S6K (b) and p‐4E‐BP1 (c) on CD19+ B cells were
  detected with flow cytometry assay (n = 5). *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001
