caption: Differential expression of enzymes involved in glycolysis, pentose phosphate
  pathway, TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation in RA CD8+ Tem cells. Solid red
  UP arrows indicate upregulation/increased activity. Solid blue down arrows indicate
  downregulation. Light red arrows indicate statistically significant upregulation
  with low read counts. Pathways where the overall effect of differential regulation
  on the activity of the pathway is ambiguous are marked by a question mark. PPP—pentose
  phosphate pathway; G6P—glucose-6-phosphate; F6P—fructose-6-phosphate; GA3P—glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.
