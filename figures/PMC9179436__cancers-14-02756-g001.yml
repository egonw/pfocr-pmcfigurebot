caption: Regulation of activating IDO1 transcription. IFN-γ promotes STAT1 phosphorylation
  by JAK, then STAT1 dimerization binding to GAS-2 and GAS-3 sites upstream of the
  IDO1 coding region to activate IDO1 transcription and induce IRF-1 synthesis. IRF-1
  binds to ISRE-1 and ISRE-2 sites in concert with STAT1 to promote IDO expression.
  IFN-β upregulates IDO1 expression via activating JAK1/TyK2 and STAT1/STAT2. Another
  regulatory pathway, activation of IKKα by NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) results in
  the formation of p52-REL-B dimers, which promotes NF-κB translocation and attaches
  to the IDO1 coding region. TNF-α synergistically enhancing the IDO1 induction effect
  of IFN-γ.
