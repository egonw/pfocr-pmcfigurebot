caption: 'Overall architecture of gap junction channels, connexin hemichannels, and
  Panx-1 channels. (A) Ribbon and surface representations of the Cx46 GJ channel viewed
  from the lateral side. The dodecameric assembly allows the permeation of ions and
  small metabolites between adjacent cells. (B) Ribbon model for the Cx31.3 hemichannel
  viewed from lateral side (left) and from the extracellular side (right). Hemichannels
  assemble in hexamers and provide a conduction pathway for ions and small molecules
  between extracellular and intracellular compartments. (C) Ribbon representations
  of the Panx-1 channel. Panx-1 channels assemble as heptamers and provide a pathway
  for paracrine/autocrine signaling. Protein data bank (PDB) codes: 7JKC (Cx46) [],
  6L3U (Cx31.3) [], and 6WBF (Panx-1) [].'
