caption: 'TWEAK transactivates TLR4 to recruit TBK1/IKKε signaling in tubular cells.
  (A) TWEAK was administered ip to wild-type (WT) or TLR4 −/−  mice and kidney gene
  expression was analyzed at 24 h. (B) The expression of proinflammatory chemokines
  (Ccl5 and Cxcl10) shown to be sensitive to TBK1/IKKε/IRF3-dependent regulation in
  MCT cells was assessed by qRT-PCR. *p ≤ 0.05 vs WT control mice; #p ≤ 0.05 vs TWEAK-injected
  WT mice (n = 4 mice per group). (C) Pharmacological inhibition of TLR4 downregulates
  LPS-induced cytokine and ISG responses in cultured tubular cells. MCT cells were
  stimulated with 1.0 μg/ml LPS alone for 6 h or pretreated with 10 μM of the TLR4
  blocker Cli-095 (Cli) for 3 h prior to LPS stimulation for 6 h Ifit1, Cxcl10, Ccl5,
  and Ccl2 mRNA expression was evaluated by qRT-PCR. The bar graph shows the Mean
  ± SEM of four individual experiments. *p ≤ 0.05 vs control; #p ≤ 0.05 vs LPS treatment.
  (D,E) Inhibition of TWEAK-induced RELA/p65 and pIRF3 nuclear translocation by pharmacological
  blockade of TLR4 in tubular cells. MCT cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml TWEAK
  for 20 min or pretreated with Cli-095 (Cli) for 3 h prior to TWEAK stimulation.
  TLR4 blockade prevented TWEAK-induced RELA/p65 (green fluorescence) nuclear translocation
  (D) as well as nuclear phosphorylated IRF3 content (pIRF3, green fluorescence) (E).
  Nuclei were stained with DAPI. The figure shows typical images obtained in a representative
  experiment. Original magnification ×400. Bars 10 µm. (F) Downregulation of TWEAK-induced
  cytokine and ISG responses in cultured tubular cells by pharmacological blockade
  of TLR4. Cultured MCT cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml TWEAK for 6 h (left panel)
  or 24 h (right panel) with or without pretreatment with Cli-095 (Cli). Ifit1, Cxcl10,
  Ccl5, and Ccl2 mRNA expression was evaluated by qRT-PCR. Mean ± SEM (n = 3,4); *p
  ≤ 0.05 vs control; #p ≤ 0.05 vs TWEAK.'
