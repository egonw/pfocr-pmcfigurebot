caption: The differential bacteria in obesity and as a causation to obese. (A) Intestinal
  bacteria was both the cause and syndrome for the obesity. Causation relationship
  between the disease and organic bacteria. Microbiota transplanted from the obesity
  children to germ free mice caused the same syndromes. The strain of Enterobacter
  cloacae B29 was proved as the prime culprit to little fatties’ children syndrome.
  Toxins such LPS produced through playing pleiotropic role one pathway was recognized
  by toll like receptor 4 to upstream signal pathway to regulate gut permeability,
  and control adipose tissue metabolism through mediating cannabinoid-driven adipogenesis,
  which accelerated the syndrome of obesity. (B) Then possible molecular signal pathway
  of Enterobacter cloacae B29 regulated the adipose tissue metabolism. The toxin produced
  by Enterobacter cloacae B29 can promote the syndrome. Toxins such LPS produced through
  playing pleiotropic role one pathway was recognized by toll like receptor 4 to upstream
  signal pathway to regulate gut permeability. The signaling pathways involved include
  the ERK/p38/JNK and nuclear transcription factor pathways were enrolled to control
  adipose tissue metabolism through mediating cannabinoid-driven adipogenesis, which
  accelerated the syndrome of obesity.
