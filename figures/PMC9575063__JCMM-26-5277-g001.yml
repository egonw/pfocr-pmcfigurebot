caption: 'NANOG knockdown inhibits EMT in ovarian cancer cells. NANOG was knocked
  down in SKOV‐3 and A2780 cells for 48 h. (A) Protein expression of NANOG and α‐actinin
  was analysed by western blot (numbers below each blot are densitometric values).
  (B, C) Cell migration and invasion assays were conducted using a Boyden chamber
  assay. Upper panel: representative image of a Boyden chamber assay. Lower panel:
  quantitative result of a Boyden chamber assay. (D) Protein expression of NANOG,
  ZEB1, vimentin, N‐cadherin and α‐actinin was analysed by western blot (numbers below
  each blot are densitometric values). Error bars represent the mean ± standard error
  (S.E) of triplicate experiments.'
