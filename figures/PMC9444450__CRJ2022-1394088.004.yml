caption: Significant pathway enrichment of DEGs and PPI network analyses of DEGs in
  lung tissues of PAH patients. (a) Significant pathway enrichment of DEGs, blue represents
  the signaling pathway, green represents downregulated genes, and red represents
  upregulated genes. (b) PPI network analyses of DEGs in lung tissues of PAH patients.
  DEGs are shown in orange. Most significant hub genes according to the highest number
  of connections, are arranged in the outermost circle.
