caption: Functional enrichment of the genes related to rsFC of the polygenic‐modulated
  sensorimotor subregions. For each bubble chart corresponding to a sensorimotor subregion,
  the x‐axis denotes the rich factor and the y‐axis denotes items from the GO, pathway
  and disease databases. The bubble size represents the number of genes overlapping
  with those belonging to each item, and the bubble color represents the −log10(p)
  with the p value corrected by the FDR‐BH. The rich factor refers to the ratio of
  the number of rsFC‐related genes annotated to the item to the number of all genes
  annotated to the item. A1/2/3tru, trunk region of area 1/2/3; A4hf, head and face
  region of area 4; A4ul, upper limb region of area 4; A1/2/3ulhf, upper limb, head,
  and face region of area 1/2/3; FDR‐BH, Benjamini and Hochberg method for false discovery
  rate; GO, gene ontology; rsFC, resting‐state functional connectivity
article_title: Transcriptional substrates underlying functional connectivity profiles
  of subregions within the human sensorimotor cortex.
