caption: Regulation of PCa cell migration by USP8, and wound healing action of docetaxel.
  (A) PCa cells DU145 and PC3 were transfected with either scrambled or SiUSP8, and
  wound healing assay was employed followed by with or without docetaxel therapy (4.5
  nM in DU145 and 3 nM in PC3) as described details in the methodology section. (B)
  The un-migrated area was measured by using ImageJ, and bar diagrams were plotted
  to represent the rate of cell migration of each independent experiment (n = 3, *p
  < 0.05). (C) PCa cells DU145 and PC3 were transfected with either mock vector or
  pCMV3-USP8-overexpressing vector, and wound healing assay was employed in the presence
  or absence of docetaxel (4.5 nM in DU145 and 3 nM in Pc3) as described details in
  methodology. (D) The un-migrated area was measured by using ImageJ, and bar diagrams
  were plotted to represent the rate of cell migration of each independent experiment
  (n = 3, *p < 0.05).
