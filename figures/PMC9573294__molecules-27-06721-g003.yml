caption: 'Effect of 2′3′-cGAMP on EMT markers. (A) ENPP1 mRNA levels were quantified
  in A549 Dual™ and MDA-MB-231. Ct values of ENPP1 were normalized with respective
  Ct values for GAPDH (normalized Ct). Relative fold change was plotted considering
  A549 Dual™ as 1 (n = 3). (B–E) A549 Dual™ and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with
  25 µM 2′3′-cGAMP for 24 h, and mRNA levels of various EMT markers were estimated
  using RT-PCR (B) E-CAD, (C) VIM, (D) N-CAD, and (E) TWIST1 (n = 3). (F–H) Inflammatory
  cytokine mRNA levels were also quantified in the same experiment (F), IFN-β, (G),
  CXCL-10, (H), and IL-6. The fold change values were plotted using GAPDH as endogenous
  control (n=3). The p-values were calculated using paired Student’s t-test. * p <
  0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, ns: non-significant.'
