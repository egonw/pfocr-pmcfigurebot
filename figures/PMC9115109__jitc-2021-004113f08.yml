caption: SNORA38B LNAs sensitized NSCLC to ICBs treatment. (A) Transfection efficiency
  of LNAs in LLC cells. (B) Tumor volume examined in LLC derived tumors in tumor burden
  C57BL/6J mice according to formula 0.5×L×W2. n=5 per group. (C–D) Representative
  images and quantification of BLI in the luciferase reporter gene labeled LLC tumor
  regions in C57BL/6J mice treated with PBS, LNA, ICB or LNA+ICB. Signals were recorded
  every 4 days before reaching the observation endpoint. n=5 per group. (E–F) Flow
  cytometry detection of CD3+CD8+ T cells, CD4+FOXP3+ Tregs and their percentage of
  CD45+ cells isolated from LLC cells injected C57BL/6J mice treated with PBS, LNA,
  ICB or LNA+ICB. (G) IHC staining of AKT/mTOR/GAB2 signing pathway with the isolated
  burden tumors from C57BL/6J mice treated with PBS, LNA, ICB or LNA+ICB. Bar=100
  µm. (H–K) Quantification of IHC staining of AKT/mTOR/GAB2 signing pathway. (L) Basic
  summary of the carcinogenic mechanism of SNORA38B in NSCLC. SNORA38B directly bound
  to the transcription factor E2F1, then accelerated the transcription of downstream
  GAB2 gene, activated AKT/mTOR pathway and its downstream effectors to perform cancer-promoting
  effects. Besides, SNORA38B recruited Tregs to mediate immunosuppression by promoting
  the secretion of IL-10. Knockdown of SNORA38B using LNAs could sensitize NSCLC to
  ICB treatment. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001. Assays were conducted
  in triple. Means±SD was shown. Statistical analysis was subjected to one-way analysis
  of variance. Comparison between-group using LSD method. BLI, bioluminescence imaging;
  CTLA-4, cytotoxic T-lymphocytes-associated protein 4; E2F, E2F transcription factor;
  GAB2, GRB2-associated-binding protein 2; ICB, immune checkpoint blockade; IHC, immunohistochemistry;
  IL, interleukin; LLC, murine Lewis lung carcinoma; LNA, locked nucleic acid; LSD,
  the Fisher's least significant difference; NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer; p-AKT,
  phosphorylation of protein kinase B; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PD-1, programmed
  cell death protein-1; p-mTOR, phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin;
  Scr, scramble; SNORNA, small nucleolar RNA; TME, tumor microenvironment; Treg, regulatory
  T cells;.
