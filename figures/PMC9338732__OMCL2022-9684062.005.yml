caption: 'LATS and YAP mediated the effects of irisin on the ECM metabolism in human
  NPCs. (a) The expression levels of YAP protein were detected by western blot between
  control and degenerative groups. (b) IHC staining was performed to detect the YAP
  expression level between control and puncture groups in rats'' intervertebral disc.
  Images (magnification: ×400, scale bar: 50 μm). (c) Protein expression levels of
  the Hippo signaling pathway (LATS1, LATS2, p-LATS1/2, YAP, and p-YAP) were detected
  by western blot in different groups. (d) Quantitative analysis of the bands in (c)
  using ImageJ software. (e) The localization of YAP was assessed via immunofluorescence
  in different groups. Images (magnification: ×400, scale bar: 50 μm). (f) The protein
  expression levels of ECM metabolism markers (COL2A1, MMP13, ADAMTS4, and ADAMTS5)
  were assessed by western blot in human NPCs. (g) The expression levels of ADAMTS4,
  COL2A1, and CTGF were detected by immunofluorescence in human NPCs. Images (magnification:
  ×400, scale bar: 50 μm). In this figure, irisin was used at the concentration of
  100 ng/ml, TNF-α was used at the concentration of 10 ng/ml, and verteporfin was
  used at the concentration of 5 μmol/l. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01.'
