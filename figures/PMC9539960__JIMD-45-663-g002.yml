caption: Added value of genomics and metabolomics data integration. Exome or genome
  sequencing (genomics) provides data on variants found in the DNA of a patient, whereas
  targeted or untargeted metabolomics provides data on aberrant metabolites. The integration
  of both data sets may aid in the interpretation of variants. For example, the metabolic
  profile of a patient showed an elevated level of substrate 1 and a decrease of products
  1 and 2, implicating that there is a defect in pathway one that in turn points to
  gene A with a VUS. VUS, variant of unknown significance.
