caption: 'Schematic representation of TXNIP in mediating signaling pathway in cancer
  impediments. This picture represents how TXNIP is involved in cancer suppression
  via JAK/STAT, AMPK/mTOR, and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. Note: Interleukins; JAK:
  Janus kinase; STAT: signal transducer and activator of transcription; HIF: Hypoxia-inducible
  factors; TXNIP: Thioredoxin-interacting protein; Trx: Thioredoxin; PI3K: Phosphatidylinositol
  3 kinase; AKT: Protein Kinase B; RTK: Receptor tyrosine kinase; KCNK3: Potassium
  Channel, Subfamily K, Member 3; AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; mTOR: Mammalian
  target of rapamycin; GLUT1: Glucose transporter 1; G: Glucose; G6P: Glucose 6 phosphate;
  K: Potassium; p: Phosphorylation. The black line/arrow represents the regulating
  pathway, and the blue line represents the inhibitory role.'
