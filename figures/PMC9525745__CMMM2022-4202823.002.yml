caption: 'Weighted gene coexpression network analysis of microarray data. (a) Sample
  dendrogram and trait heatmap: the red representation in the graph is marked as nonzero
  samples in the trait data. (b) Gene dendrogram with trait: this figure is divided
  into three parts. The first part is the phylogenetic clustering tree of genes. The
  second part shows the module color display of the corresponding genes. The third
  part shows the correlation between the genes in each character-related sample and
  its module. The redder the color, the more positive the correlation. The negative
  correlation is blue. (c) Gene saliency map of module blue and turquoise members:
  scatter plot of module kME value and gene saliency value, higher the core value,
  smaller the P value, and the module members can represent the module characteristics
  better.'
