caption: 'Effects of ATL-III on TM-induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells. (a) Flow cytometry
  assays for the protective effect of ATL-III against apoptosis in H9c2 cells. (b)
  Apoptosis rate by flow cytometry. (c) Protective effect of ATL-III against apoptosis
  in H9c2 cells detected by Hoechst/PI double staining. (d) Protein expression levels
  of Bcl-2 (d, e), Bax (d, f), and Caspase-3 (d, g). Data were mean ± SD; ∗∗P < 0.01
  versus control group; ##P < 0.01 versus model group.'
