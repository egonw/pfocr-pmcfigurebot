caption: Cell proliferation and cell migration assay results. (a) Colony formation
  assay was performed on HepG2 cells at indicated concentrations of apigetrin (0,
  50, and 100 µM) for 10 days and colonies were stained by Giemsa solution. (b) A
  wound healing assay was performed at stated concentrations (0, 50, and 100 µM) of
  apigetrin for 48 h. The data are presented as the mean ± standard error of mean
  (SEM). *** p < 0.001.
