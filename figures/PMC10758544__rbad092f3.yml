caption: Byakangelicol inhibited osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption by suppressing
  the TiPs-induced upregulation of COX-2 in vitro. (A) Immunofluorescence staining
  of COX-2 in RAW264.7 after intervention with TiPs. (B) Western blot and quantitative
  analysis showing levels of COX-2 after intervention with TiPs. (C) qRT-PCR results
  showing expression levels of COX-2 mRNA (ptgs2) after intervention with TiPs. (D)
  Potential targets of action for byakangelicol. (E) Molecular docking. (F) CCK-8
  assay of byakangelicol, n = 5. (G and H) Representative TRAP staining images and
  quantification of TRAP-positive cells. (I and J) SEM images and quantification of
  osteoclast resorbed area of the bone resorption after byakangelicol treatment. (K
  and L) Western blot and quantitative analysis showing levels of COX-2, MMP9 and
  NFATc1 after intervention with TiPs. Scale bar = 50 µm. The data were represented
  as mean ± SD of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01. qRT-PCR, quantitative
  real-time PCR.
