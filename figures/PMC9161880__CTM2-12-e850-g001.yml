caption: UGRP1 enhances expression of TLR2, NOD2, MyD88 and NLRP3 by activation of
  NF‐κB. (A) PEMs were treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX (10 μM) for
  1 h followed by Pam3CSK4 stimulation with BSA or UGRP1 (0.5 μg/ml) for 6 h to measure
  Il1b mRNA by qRT‐PCR (n = 3). (B) The relative mRNA levels of gene from TLRs and
  NLRs pathway in PEMs after UGRP1 (0.5 μg/ml) treatment for 3 h (n = 3). (C) PEMs
  were treated with UGRP1 (0.5 μg/ml) for 3 or 6 h to check Tlr2, MyD88, Nod2 and
  Nlrp3 mRNA by qRT‐PCR (n = 3). (D) PEMs were treated with UGRP1 (0.5 μg/ml) for
  the indicated periods to check NLRP3, TLR2, MyD88 and NOD2 protein levels by immunoblot
  analysis. (E) PEMs were treated with the NF‐κB inhibitor PDTC (100 μM) for 1 h followed
  by BSA or UGRP1 (0.5 μg/ml) treatment for 6 h to measure Tlr2 and Nod2 mRNA by qRT‐PCR
  (n = 3). (F) PEMs were treated with UGRP1 (0.5 μg/ml) for 1 h and the relative amount
  of Tlr2 and Nod2 DNA binding to p65 was analysed by ChIP assay. (G) MyD88 KO PEMs
  were treated with UGRP1 (0.5 μg/ml) for 6 h to check Tlr2 and Nod2 mRNA by qRT‐PCR
  (n = 3). (H) PEMs were treated with IRAK1/4 inhibitor IRAK‐1‐4 Inhibitor I (10 μM),
  TAK1 inhibitor Takinib (10 μM), IKKβ inhibitor LY2409881 trihydrochloride (5 μM)
  or p‐IκBα inhibitor BAY 11–7082 (20 μM) for 1 h followed by UGRP1 (0.5 μg/ml) treatment
  for 6 h to measure Tlr2 and Nod2 mRNA by qRT‐PCR (n = 3). *p < .05, **p < .01 and
  ***p < .001, using a two‐tailed, unpaired Student's t‐test (G), one‐way analysis
  of variance (ANOVA) with Holm–Sidak's multiple comparisons test (C and H) or two‐way
  ANOVA with Holm–Sidak's multiple comparisons test (A and E). Data from at least
  three independent experiments (mean ± SD) or representative data (D). Please also
