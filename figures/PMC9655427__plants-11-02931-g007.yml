caption: Integrative analysis of proteomics and metabolomics data. (a) Visualization
  of metabolic pathways significantly impacted by cadmium treatment and (b) significant
  intra-omics correlations. The pathway impact analysis was visualized by MetaboAnalyst.
  Omics data interaction was evaluated by OmicsAnalyst using Pearson’s correlation
  threshold of 0.75 for intra-omics interactions. For details, see .
