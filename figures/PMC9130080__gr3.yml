caption: Effect of TCS on the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles in Neuro-2a cells.
  The cells were treated with DMSO (control), 0.2 µM temsirolimus (positive control),
  and TCS (10, 30 and 50 µM) for 24 h. (a) Representative fluorescence microscopy
  images to show the formation of autophagic vacuoles in cells by staining with MDC.
  The images were captured at 200× magnification (scale bar, 58 µm). (b) Representative
  confocal microscopy images depicting EGFP-LC3 puncta formation in response to various
  treatment conditions. The images were captured at 630× magnification (scale bar,
  20 µm). The bar graph below respective figures in (a) and (b) indicates the quantification
  of the respective images performed with the use of ImageJ software. Results are
  representative of three independent experiments with mean ± SEM. * indicates p < 0.05
  as compared to vehicle treated control. TCS, triclosan; Tem, temsirolimus; MDC,
  monodansylcadaverine.
