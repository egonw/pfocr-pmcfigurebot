caption: Molecular mechanisms of RBP4 in obesity and associated disease. (A) In adipocytes,
  the retinol-RBP4 complex directly inhibits insulin signaling by activating the JAK2/STAT5/SOCS3
  pathway, leading to IR. (B) In adipose tissue, macrophages, retinol-RBP4 and RBP4
  interact with TLR2 and TLR4/MD2 and downstream pathways of MyD88 and TRIF, releasing
  TNFα, IL-6, MCP-1, INF-γ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-12, IL-8 and IL-10. This results in activation
  of the immune system and promotes an inflammatory state as well as inhibition of
  insulin signaling. (C) RBP4 induces NF-κB and NADPH oxidase-dependent endothelial
  inflammation, leading to development of OS by mitochondrial dysfunction. (D) RBP4
  increases hepatic expression of PEPCK, thus increasing glucose production in the
  liver. (E) In skeletal muscle, RBP4 is associated with high serine 307 phosphorylation
  of IRS-1, which decreases its affinity for PI3K and inhibits insulin signaling.
  (F) Retinol-RBP4 promotes β-cell dysfunction via the JAK2/STAT1/ISL-1 pathway. (G)
  Aforementioned mechanisms promote development of hyperglycemia. PKB, Protein kinase
