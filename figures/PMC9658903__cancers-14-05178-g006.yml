caption: Suppression of Hh signalling proved that P. acnes promotes EOC progression
  in mice by regulating the Hh signalling pathway. (A) H&E staining images of tumour
  tissues were presented; bar represents 50μm. (B) Immunohistochemistry of Gli1 expression
  was determined in ovarian cancer of mice; the bar represents 50μm. (C) Average integrated
  optical density (IOD) value of Gli1 expression in each group of tumour specimens.
  (D) Western blot analysis of Ptch1, Gli1, and Gli2 expression in tumour tissues;
  β-actin was used as an internal control (n = 3). The relative expressions of (E)
  Ptch1, (F) Gli1, and (G) Gli2 were quantified by Image J. Data are presented as
  means ± SD. Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA, both with Tukey’s test for multiple
  comparisons, and the Log-rank test were performed for survival data; * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01. (H) Smo, (I) Ptch1, (J) Gli1, and (K) Gli2.
