caption: 'GABAARα1 negatively regulates TLR4 expression. Using TAK-242 to inhibit
  TLR4 or Muscimol to activate GABAARα1, Protein was collected from the temporal cortex
  (A), hippocampus (D), medullary dorsal horn (G), and trigeminal ganglion (J) of
  comorbidity, comorbidity + TAK-242, and comorbidity + Muscimol rats. Protein extracts
  were immunoblotted with antibodies to TLR4, GABAARα1, GAPDH used as a gel loading
  control. The results are expressed as densitometric units normalized to GAPDH ±
  SEM. The TLR4 levels were lower in comorbidity + TAK-242 and comorbidity + Muscimol
  groups compared with the comorbidity group (n = 3, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01) (B,E,H,K).
  The GABAARα1 levels were higher in comorbidity + Muscimol group compared with the
  comorbidity and comorbidity + TAK-242 groups (n = 3, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01) (C,F,I,L).
  TC: temporal cortex, H: hippocampus, DH: medullary dorsal horn, TG: trigeminal ganglion,
  C: comorbidity.'
