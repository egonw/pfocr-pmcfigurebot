caption: Efficacy of matched therapies in patients enrolled in affiliated clinical
  trials. (A) The prevalence of patients with tier 1 or 2 genomic alterations as the
  most actionable alterations. (B) Number of targeted trials enrolling patients in
  GI-SCREEN (box plot) and proportion of patients enrolled in a matched clinical trial
  among those with actionable alterations (line plot). (C) Number of patients who
  had tumor responses according to RECIST v1.1 by matched therapies in the matched
  clinical trials. (D) Kaplan-Meier curves of PFS of patients receiving matched therapies
  in matched clinical trials. (E) Kaplan-Meier curves of OS of treatment-na√Øve patients
  with metastatic colorectal cancer harboring actionable alterations receiving matched
  therapies in matched clinical trials and SOC and no actionable alterations. CR,
  complete response; OS, overall survival; PD, progressive disease; PFS, progression-free
  survival; PR, partial response; RECIST, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors;
  SD, stable disease; SOC, standard of care.
