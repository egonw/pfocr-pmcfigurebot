caption: 'Common pathway analysis generated by MetaboAnalyst 5.0, based on differential
  metabolites from both T0 vs. T1 and T0 vs. T2. (A) TCA cycle; (B) pentose phosphate
  and purine metabolism pathways. For details in figures, refer to the SGD (http://pathway.yeastgenome.org/,
  assessed on 6 April 2023) and KEGG (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/, assessed on 6 April
  2023) databases. Abbreviations: ACO2: aconitase; ADMI: adenosine 5-monophosphate
  deaminase; AMP: adenosine monophosphate; APTI: adenine phosphoribosyltransferase;
  CS: citrate synthase; FH: fumarate hydratase; G6PD: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  IDH: isocitrate dehydrogenase; IMP: inosine monophosphate; KGD: 2-ketoglutarate–dehydrogenase
  complex; LSC: succinyl-CoA ligase; MDH: malate dehydrogenase; PGD: 6-phosphogluconate
  dehydrogenase; PGLS: 6-phosphogluconolactonase; PRPP: 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate;
  PRPS: ribose-phosphate pyrophosphokinase; RPLA: ribose 5-phosphate isomerase A;
  SDH: succinate dehydrogenase. All data are expressed as the mean ± SEM. Significance:
  * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01. Red color in figure means the differential metabolites.'
