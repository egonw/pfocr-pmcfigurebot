caption: Pathway analysis of switch genes from males with Alzheimer’s disease (M-AD).
  (A) Biological and functional analysis of switch genes from M-AD compared to controls
  was performed in NetworkAnalyst. Switch genes are depicted in red. (B)The pathways
  are ranked according to the number of hits and lowest value of p. Pathways are derived
  from the KEGG database. The unique pathways are shown in red.
