caption: 'Analysis of the BES1 transcription factor that regulates BcGRP23 promoter
  activity. (A) Effects of different hormones on the expression of BcGRP23 in flowering
  Chinese cabbage. Different lowercase letters indicate significant differences at
  the p < 0.05 level. (B) Luciferase (LUC)/Renilla (REN) ratio indicating the relative
  luciferase activity in the dual-LUC assay. **Significant difference at the p < 0.01
  level. (C, D) Yeast one-hybrid analysis. (C) Autoactivation of the BcGRP23 promoters
  was tested on synthetically defined (SD) medium without Ura in the presence of aureobasidin
  A (AbA). AbA100, 100 ng/ml AbA; AbA200, 200 ng/ml AbA. (D) Interactions were determined
  on SD medium without Leu in the presence of 200 ng/ml AbA (−Leu+AbA200). (a) Negative
  control: AD-Empty+BcGRP23 promoter.'
