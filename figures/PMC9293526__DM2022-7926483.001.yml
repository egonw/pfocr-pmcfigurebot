caption: Downregulation of miR-26a-5p in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. (a) The expression
  of miR-26a-5p in LUAD tumor samples (N = 521) and normal samples (N = 46) based
  on TCGA database. (b) Overall survival between high miR-26a-5p expression group
  and low miR-26a-5p expression group was determined by Kaplan-Meier plot using log-rank
  test in TCGA database. (c) The expression of miR-26a-5p between NSCLC cell lines
  and BEAS2B was analyzed by qRT-PCR. ∗∗P < 0.01; ∗∗∗P < 0.001.

  DNMT3A-Mediated SFRP1 Methylation and Inhibits Cancer Stem Cell-Like Properties
  of NSCLC.
