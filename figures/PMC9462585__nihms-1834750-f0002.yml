caption: (A) Organization of the herbicidin gene cluster (her) and part of the aureonuclemycin
  gene cluster (anm). (B) Proposed herbicidin biosynthetic pathway and representatives
  of isolated herbicidin derivatives. The reactions catalyzed by Her8/9/10/11 have
  been verified in vitro. (C) Potential mechanism of bond formation between C5′ and
  C6′ if catalyzed by Her6.
