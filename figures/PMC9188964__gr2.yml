caption: SNHG22 functions as a regulator of miR-128-3p in trophoblasts. Starbase database
  was used to predict the potential binding site between SNHG22 and miR-128-3p. (B)
  miR-128-3p expression in normal placenta (n = 25) and PE placenta (n = 25) tissues
  was determined by q-PCR. (C) Spearman's correlation analysis was applied to detect
  the correlation between the expression of miR-128-3p and SNHG22 in PE placenta tissues
  (n = 25). (D and E) HTR-8/Svneo and JEG-3 cells were co-transfected with miR-128-3p
  mimic or miR-128-3p inhibitor and SNHG22-WT or SNHG22-MUT. The luciferase activity
  was determined by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. (F) miR-128-3p expression in
  SNHG22-silenced HTR-8/Svneo and JEG-3 cells was determined by q-PCR. Experiments
  were replicated three times. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.
  Data are expressed as mean ± SD.
