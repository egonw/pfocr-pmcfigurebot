figure_title: Dysregulated immune signalling in fibroblasts of patients with MIRAS
  to viral PAMP mimetics
caption: 'a, The genotype–phenotype association of MIRAS POLG1 variant (rs113994097).
  Significance (P values) and disease categories are shown. The triangles indicate
  diseases or traits: upward-pointing triangles show a positive association, and vice
  versa. The dotted line shows the cut-off for significance. Analysis was performed
  using SAIGE mixed model logistic regression. Data are from ref. . b, POLG1 protein
  levels in patients with MIRAS (patient) and control fibroblasts. Western blot and
  quantification. The loading control was HSP60. Fibroblasts are from six patients
  and six control individuals, all female. c, Schematic of antiviral innate immune
  signalling responses to viral PAMPs. d, IFN-I signalling pathway genes induced by
  viral PAMP mimetics (dsRNA/poly(I:C) or dsDNA) in patient and control fibroblasts
  (as in b). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of cDNA. The reference gene was ACTB.
  Top, box plot. Bottom, heat map showing the average gene expression per condition.
  e, IFN-I signalling pathway protein induction by viral PAMP mimetic (dsRNA (poly(I:C))
  or dsDNA) in patient and control (C) fibroblasts. Representative western blot analysis
  of four female control individuals and patients. The loading control was HSP60.
  Quantification is shown in Extended Data Fig. . f, Paracrine immune signalling of
  fibroblasts in response to treatment with viral PAMP mimetic. Representative western
  blot of four female control individuals and patients (Pt). The loading control was
  HSP60. Quantification is shown in Extended Data Fig. . g, mtDNA and mtRNA release
  into cytosolic extracts of fibroblasts (as in b; Extended Data Fig. ) after viral
  PAMP mimetic exposure for 7 h. Cytosolic versus whole-cell MT-CYB and MT-CO1 DNA
  or cDNA was analysed using qPCR. h,i, Immune signalling (h) and necroptosis activation
  (i) in fibroblasts (as in b) after prolonged viral PAMP mimetic treatment. Quantification
  of the western blot is shown for the indicated treatment times (Extended Data Fig.
  ). The loading control was β-actin. For b, d, g, h and i, the box plots show minimum
  to maximum values (whiskers), 25th to 75th percentiles (box limits) and median (centre
  line). Statistical analysis was performed using two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-tests.
