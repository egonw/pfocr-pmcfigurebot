caption: Pathway analysis of young and old microglia that either did or did not take
  up peptide showed deficiencies of old microglia. Young (2 months) and old (18 months)
  microglia (3 male mice were combined to make one replicate; this was repeated for
  a total of 4 replicates/group) were incubated with 2.5 μM of Aβ42 for 2 h and then
  were FACSorted based on Aβ42 uptake. Sorted microglia’s RNA was isolated and used
  to run bulk RNAseq analysis. (a) Schematic of phagocytosis assay and flow sorting,
  images made using ©BioRender - biorender.com. (b) Principal component analysis plot
  of the four different microglia groups (Young Aβ42+, Young Aβ42−, Old Aβ42+, Old
  Aβ42−) with 4 replicates each. Pathway analysis of DEGs in both the young and old
  (c) Aβ42+ and (d) Aβ42− microglia graphed based on their p value. The number of
  DEGs in each pathway are indicated in parentheses.

  by gene expression changes reflective of underlying neurologic disease.
