caption: 'Streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia is associated with metabolome divergence
  after ciprofloxacin treatment. (A) Bray–Curtis dissimilarity of Q-TOF-MS extracts
  from experimental groups. (B) KEGG pathway enrichment of differentially abundant
  Q-TOF-MS metabolites after ciprofloxacin treatment. Data represent STZ-treated mice
  versus normoglycemic controls. Split-colored bars indicate that this biological
  pathway contains metabolites that were both enriched and depleted. (C) Differentially
  abundant Q-TOF-MS metabolites in control and STZ-treated mice during ciprofloxacin
  treatment. Data represent log2 fold change versus vehicle-treated controls ± SEM.
  Numbers represent grouping by biological pathways: (1) monosaccharides, (2) central
  metabolism and respiratory metabolites, (3) steroid and heme biosynthesis and processing,
  (4) nucleotide metabolism, (5) amino acid metabolism. For full results see . For
  all panels, n = 6 per group, with 2 technical replicates per group. For (A): permutational
  ANOVA (** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001).'
