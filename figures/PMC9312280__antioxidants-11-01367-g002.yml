caption: 'Effects of PKLPs on: (a) ROS level express mean fluorescence intensity;
  (b) GSH-px; (c) CAT; (d) T-SOD activities in H2O2-induced Caco-2 cells. The cells
  were pre-treated with catechin (75 mg/mL) and PKLPs (50 mg/mL) before being stimulated
  with H2O2 (200 μM/L) for 4 h. The reported values are represented as mean ± SD (n
  = 3). Columns marked with different lowercase letters indicate the significant differences
  among treatments by using Duncan analysis (p < 0.05).'
