caption: NP cell phenotypes when miR-217 was overexpressed or silenced. A Cy3 was
  employed to detect miR-217 mimics or inhibitor transfected and cultured NP cells,
  scale bar = 20 μm. B EdU assay was used to evaluate the proliferation of NP cells
  that were transfected with different treatments. Scale bar = 100 μm. C FCM was used
  to determine the apoptosis of NP cells. D, E Immunofluorescence was used to determine
  the Col II and MMP13 levels. F Western blotting was used to determine the levels
  of Col II, Aggrecan, MMP13, and ADAMT5. n=3. IDD, intervertebral disc degeneration;
  miR, microRNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole;
  FCM, flow cytometry; Col II, type II collagen; MMP, matrix metalloprotein; ADAMTS,
  a disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs; NP, nucleus
  pulposus; EdU, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine
