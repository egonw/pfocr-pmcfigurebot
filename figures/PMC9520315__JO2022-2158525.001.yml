caption: 'Mutation frequency and transcription level of tryptophan metabolism-related
  genes in TCGA-LUAD. (a) Total mutation frequency of tryptophan metabolism-related
  genes in TCGA-LUAD. (b) GSEA between mutant and nonmutant groups of tryptophan metabolism-related
  genes in TCGA-LUAD. Pathways with normalized enrichment score (NES) < 0 defined
  as the inhibited group and NES > 0 as the activated group. (c) Copy number variation
  map of tryptophan metabolism genes. (d) Difference in transcription levels of tryptophan
  metabolism genes among different copy number variants. (e) Transcriptional differences
  in tryptophan metabolizing genes between tumor and normal tissues. ns: not significant.
