caption: The effects of GLP1R and PKA on the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway in EC cells.
  (A) The correlation between the expressions of GLP1R and PKA was analyzed by TIMER
  database (http://cistrome.dfci.harvard.edu/TIMER/), rho = 0.181, p = 2.05e‐05. (B
  and C) The concentration of cAMP in Ishikawa and RL95‐2 cells was accessed by ELISA.
  (D–I) The detection of protein expressions (GLP1R, p‐PKA and PKA) in the Con, OE‐GLP1R,
  si‐PKA and si‐PKA + OE‐GLP1R groups was conducted by western blot, with GAPDH serving
  as the internal reference. All experiments were repeated three times to obtain average
  values. The data from three independent experiments were presented as the mean ± SD;
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001 versus Con; ^^p < 0.01; ^^^p < 0.001 versus
  OE‐GLP1R; ++p < 0.01, +++p < 0.001 versus si‐PKA. GLP1R, glucagon‐like peptide‐1
  receptor; cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; Con, control; EC, endometrial carcinoma;
  ELISA, enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate dehydrogenase;
  OE‐GLP1R, GLP1R overexpression; PKA, protein kinase A; SD, standard deviation; si‐PKA,
  small interference RNA targeting PKA.
