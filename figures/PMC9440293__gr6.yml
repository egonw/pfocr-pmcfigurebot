caption: Metabolic pathway differences across the genetic modifiers of NAFLDPLS-DA–score
  plot showing metabolic pathway differences across three major gene variants vs.
  WT groups.(A) PNPLA3 vs. WT.(B) TM6SF2 vs. WT.(C) HSD17B13 vs. WT.(D) Metabolic
  pathways/subsystems commonly regulated among three different gene variants with
  (PLS-DA, VIP score >1).(E) Normalized flux differences across the metabolic subsystems
  between three major gene variants associated vs. WT groups. Red and blue color denotes
  up- and downregulation (two-sample t-test, p < 0.05 adjusted for FDR) of reaction
  fluxes across the metabolic subsystems within at two.(F and G) Beanplots showing
  differences in the log2 intensities of the Cer(m42:0) and retinyl palmitate measured
  in the serum samples of a patient subgroup (n = 14) exclusively carrying variants
  for PNPLA3 (homo- and heterozygous) gene vs. WT (n = 11). The dotted line denotes
  the mean of the population, and the black dashed lines in the bean plots represent
  the group mean. Statistical significance was determined by (two-sample t-test, p
  < 0.05 adjusted for FDR, p.adj).
