caption: 'Fold regulation of genes involved in the BH4 pathway from the RT2 profiler
  PCR array data, represented as a volcano plot. The red horizontal line represents
  p = 0.05, the points above are indicative of p < 0.05, and the points below are
  indicative of p > 0.05. The black vertical lines represent the log2 fold change
  threshold of âˆ’0.5/0.5 respectively, with no change indicated by the middle line.
  Red, black, and green dots indicate upregulated, no change and downregulated genes,
  respectively. The dots above the red line indicate a greater than 1.5-fold change
  (x-axis) and p < 0.05 (y-axis). The fold regulation and p-values are listed beside
  each volcano plot. (a) Volcano plot between the pain model (infraorbital nerve constriction
  (IONC) + no treatment) and the control group. (b) Volcano plot between the tranilast-treated
  group after 6 h (IONC + tranilast treatment) and the pain model (IONC + no treatment).
  (c) Volcano plot between the tranilast-treated group after 24 h (IONC + tranilast
  treatment) and the pain model (IONC + no treatment). (d) Volcano plot between the
  tranilast-treated group after 24 h and 6 h (IONC+ tranilast treatment). Fold regulation
  cut off: 1.5; p-value cut off = 0.05; n = 6 per group.'
