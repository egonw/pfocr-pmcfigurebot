caption: Apoptosis and enriched pathway analysis.A and B, scatterplots of apoptosis
  analysis in cultured HepG2 and granulosa cells treated with or without actinomycin
  D. C-Ethe representative scatterplots of the early apoptotic cells (annexin V +ve),
  late apoptotic cells (annexin V +ve and PI +ve), and their cumulative data (n =
  9). Probability values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant and are
  designated with up to four asterisk symbols to inform the strength of significant
  difference (∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001). F, highly enriched and significantly regulated pathways
  together with differentially regulated gene counts in oleic acid–treated granulosa
  cells. G, tyrosine kinase receptor signaling of insulin, IGF1, and EGF molecules
  and attack sites of inhibitors of the ERK1/2 (PD98059) and Akt (LY294002) pathways
  used in the present study. G, designed partly by using the BioRender available at
  app.biorender.com. n = indicates the number of independent cell culture replicates
  analyzed. EGF, epidermal growth factor; IGF1, insulin-like growth factor 1;
article_title: Estradiol production of granulosa cells is unaffected by the physiological
  mix of nonesterified fatty acids in follicular fluid.
