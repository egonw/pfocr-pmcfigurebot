caption: RELA binds to open chromatin domains in HBP core genes. For each gene (at
  left) is shown the chromatin accessibility determined by ATAC-Seq in uninfected
  (mock) or RSV-infected cells. The region assayed by Q-gPCR is indicated. The direction
  of gene transcription is indicated by arrow. At right is the Q-gPCR of mock- (CON)
  or RSV-infected cells analyzed by XChIP with RELA Ab. Each symbol is an independent
  immunoprecipitation. (A), GFPT2; (B), GNPNAT1; (C), PGM3; (D), UAP1.
