caption: 'Effects of metformin on the AMPK/ERK signaling pathway in ox-LDL-treated
  macrophages. (A) Western blot analysis was used to measure the expression levels
  of AMPK, pAMPK, ERK and pERK proteins following the indicated treatments; GAPDH
  was used as a control for the standardization of the total cellular protein. (B)
  Quantitative analysis of the activation of the AMPK and ERK enzymes. (C) Formation
  of foam cells, as detected by Oil Red O staining. Scale bar=50 µM. ***P<0.001 vs.
  the PMA group and ###P<0.001 vs. the ox-LDL group. AMPK, 5'' adenosine monophosphate-activated
  protein kinase; p, phosphorylated; ox-LDL, oxidized low-density lipoprotein; PMA,
  phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.'
