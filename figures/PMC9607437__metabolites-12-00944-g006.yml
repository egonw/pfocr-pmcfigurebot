caption: All matched pathways according to the p values from the pathway enrichment
  analysis and pathway impact values from the pathway topology analysis. The compound
  color within the pathway ranges from yellow to red, indicating different levels
  of significance of metabolites in the corresponding pathway. Circle size indicates
  the pathway impact score. SB-DT2 (C1 vs. Z1) enriched with more metabolic pathways
  than other genotypes. Corresponding pathways and their p-values are provided in
  .
