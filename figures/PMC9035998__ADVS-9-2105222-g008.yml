caption: Lipid droplets promote Numb degradation by ubiquitination and activate Notch
  pathway in CRC cells. A,B) Western blot (A) and RT‐qPCR (B) showing Numb and NICD
  levels in the control and F. nucleatum‐infected HCT116 and HT29 cells. Triacsin
  C (3 µm) was used to inhibit lipid droplet accumulation. Error bars denote the s.d.
  (n = 3 per group). p‐Value was calculated using one‐way ANOVA with post‐hoc test.
  C) Western blot showing Numb and NICD levels in the control and F. nucleatum‐infected
  HCT116 and HT29 cells. MG‐132 (10 µm) was used to inhibit ubiquitination‐mediated
  protein degradation. D,E) Fluorescent staining (3D‐SIM) showing F. nucleatum‐elevated
  Numb (D) and MDM2 (E) localization on lipid droplets. Lipid droplets were visualized
  by Nile red staining. Scale bar, 5 µm. F) Immunoprecipitation and Western blot showing
  MDM2‐mediated Numb ubiquitination on the lipid droplets. Lipid droplets were purified
  from an equal number of control and F. nucleatum‐infected HCT116 and HT29 cells,
  followed by immunoprecipitation of Numb and Western blotting for Ubiquitin (Ub).
  AMG‐232 (4 µm) was used to inhibit MDM2 activity. ADRP and GAPDH were used as markers
  of lipid droplets and cytosolic fraction, respectively.
