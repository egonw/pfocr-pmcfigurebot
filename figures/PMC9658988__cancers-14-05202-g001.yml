caption: Schematic (A) indicates the altered glucose metabolism (Warburg effect) under
  the effect of glucose in cancer cells. While several of the glycolytic intermediates
  replenish precursor molecules for macromolecular biosynthesis in the rapidly growing
  tumor, alterations in the expression and function of metabolic enzymes have been
  shown favor cancer progression in several ways. Several pharmacological agents,
  naturally occurring compounds, and small-molecule inhibitors (B) effectively block
  the tumorigenic ability of the target enzymes and metabolic pathways. However, the
  cancer cell can adapt to utilize glutamine metabolism as an alternate pathway to
  derive cellular energy and maintain the supply of precursors for macromolecular
  biosynthesis. The black and brown arrows indicate the pathway and flow of components
  involved in the pathway. The green arrows indicate how glycolytic intermediates
  can act as precursor molecules for the biosynthesis of various macromolecules. The
  red ‘x’ marks indicate how inhibiting glucose metabolism in cancer cells shuts off
  the supply of precursor molecules for macromolecular biosynthesis. The red dotted
  arrows indicate the inhibitory nature of the pharmacological agents, naturally occurring
  compounds, and small-molecule inhibitors on the target enzymes/proteins. The purple
  arrows alternate/adaptive metabolic pathways that support growth and proliferation
  of cancer cells. HK = Hexokinase, PHI = Phospho-hexose isomerase, PFK = Phosphofructokinase,
