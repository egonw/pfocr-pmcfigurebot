caption: Significant KEGG pathways and genes involved. (a) Gene enrichment analysis
  showing that KEGG pathways were significantly enriched in oxaliplatin-resistant
  LoVo xenograft tumors and genes involved in the pathways (the pathways are in the
  order of their enrichment from left to right), p < 0.05). (b) Gene Set Enrichment
  Analysis (GSEA) showing the peroxisome Hallmark enrichment score.
