caption: 'DDX3 regulated the expression of E-cadherin and β-catenin through MAPK pathway
  in CRC cells. (A) Protein expression of DDX3, p-Erk1/2, Erk1/2, E-cadherin, p-β-catenin
  (Ser675) and β-actin in DDX3-NC SW480 cells and DDX3-KD SW480 cells treated with
  or without 6.25 µmol/L PD98059 by western blot (upper left panel). Protein expression
  of DDX3, p-MEK1/2, MEK1/2, p-Erk1/2, Erk1/2, p-β-catenin (Ser675) and β-actin in
  DDX3-NC HCT116 cells and DDX3-KD HCT116 cells treated with or without 6.25 µmol/L
  PD98059 by western blot (lower left panel). Gray analysis of the protein expression
  in SW480 cells is shown in upper right panel and that in HCT116 cells is shown in
  lower right panel. ***P<0.001, ns P>0.05 via Student''s t-test. (B) Schematic model
  of DDX3 loss promoting CRC progression by regulating E-cadherin and β-catenin signaling
  through the MAPK pathway. Bar graphs are drawn from the mean ± SD of three independent
  replicates. Abbreviation: CRC, colorectal cancer; KD, knockdown; NC, negative control.'
article_title: DDX3 acts as a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer as loss of DDX3
  in advanced cancer promotes tumor progression by activating the MAPK pathway.
