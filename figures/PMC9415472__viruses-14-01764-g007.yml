caption: Canonical pathways predicted to be affected in HEKn cells expressing HPV16
  E6 and E7 oncoproteins. Included in this analysis were proteins significantly differentially
  expressed (adjusted p-value ≤ 0.02) by ≥±1.5-fold change. Black shading indicates
  a predicted increase in activity and grey shading indicates a predicted inhibition
  of canonical pathway, based on current evidence in the Qiagen Ingenuity Pathway
  database.
