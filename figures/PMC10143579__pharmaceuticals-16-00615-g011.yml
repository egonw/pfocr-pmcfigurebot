caption: 'Correlations between age at death and KP levels of ALS, FTD, FTD–ALS, EOAD
  and CONTR participants. The correlation strength is visualized by color shade and
  correlation coefficients. Significance values are classified as p ≤ 0.05, p ≤ 0.01
  and p ≤ 0.001 and are indicated by one, two or three asterisks, respectively. Abbreviations:
  KP = kynurenine pathway, BA22 = Brodmann area 22, BA6 = Brodmann area 6, BA10 =
  Brodmann area 10, ALS = amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, FTD = frontotemporal dementia,
  EOAD = early onset Alzheimer’s disease, CONTR = control individuals, 3-HK = 3-hydroxykynurenine,
  KYN = kynurenine, TRP = tryptophan, KYNA = kynurenic acid, QUIN = quinolinic acid,
  XA = xanthurenic acid.'
