caption: PHF6 possesses clinical significance and correlates with HIF-signature in
  Bca samples. A Differential analysis based on TCGA-Bca indicates the PHF6 levels
  in tumor and normal samples and was shown by boxplot. B The relative expression
  of PHF6 in breast cancer tissues or normal control tissues from the collected ZSH-Bca
  cohort was analyzed by qRT-PCR (n = 35, P < 0.001). C Representative PHF6 immunohistochemical
  (IHC) staining in breast cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. Scale bar = 200 μm
  (upper), and 50 μm (lower). D Quantification of PHF6 IHC-scores in tumor and normal
  samples. E, G Kruskal–Wallis (K-W) test showing the relationships between PHF6 and
  hazard factors, like lymphatic stages (E), clinicalpathological status (F) and TP-53
  mutation (G). H Correlation analysis was conducted to uncover relationships between
  PHF6 and HIF downstream targets based on TCGA-Bca cohort, including VEGFA, ANGPTL4,
  AQP1, and LOX. I, J Kaplan-Meir analysis with log-rank test was performed to assess
  the prognostic value of PHF6 in large Bca samples, including TCGA-Bca cohort (N = 1089,
  I) and external Meta-Validation Bca cohort (N = 2032, J). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001
