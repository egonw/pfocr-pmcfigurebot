caption: 'ELISA quantifications and validation for CCL2 release from (A) TNF-α-stimulated
  MDA-MB 231 and (B) MDA-MB-468 cells. The normalized data shows CCL2 expression (pg/mL)
  in four samples of cell supernatants, namely, resting, SANG-treated, TNF-α-treated
  cells, and co-treated cells (TNF-α + SANG). The data generated from three independent
  experiments are presented as the mean ± SEM. The significant difference between
  TNF α-treated cells vs. control cells (*) or between TNF-α-stimulated vs. co-treated
  cells (#) groups was analyzed using an unpaired t-test. **** p < 0.0001, ## p <
  0.01, # p < 0.05 are considered significant difference; NS, not significant.'
