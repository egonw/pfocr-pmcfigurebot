caption: SIAIS361034 is a selective Bcl-xL PROTAC. (A) The chemical structures of
  SIAIS361034 and negative control SIAIS361034NC showing a dual Bcl-2/Bcl-xL ligand
  linked to a CRBN ligand via an optimized linker. SIAIS361034NC has the inactive
  CRBN ligand that does not bind to CRBN E3 ligase. (B) Binding affinities of SIAIS361034
  and ABT-263 against Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and Mcl-1 were measured by Fluorescence Polarization
  assay and are represented in terms of inhibition constant (Ki). (C) Ternary complex
  formation of Bcl-xL with SIAIS361034 and CRBN E3 ligase, determined by HTRF assay.
  Data represent mean ± SD (n = 2). (D) A representative western blot analysis of
  Bcl-xL, GSPT1, IKZF1, and IKZF3 in NIH-3T3 cells after being treated with SIAIS361034
  as indicated for 24 h. (E) A representative western blot analysis of Bcl-xL, Bcl-2,
  and Mcl-1 in NIH-3T3 cells after being treated with SIAIS361034 (1 µM) and SIAIS361034NC
  (1 µM). (F) A representative western blot analysis of Bcl-xL expression in NIH-3T3
  cells after they were treated with SIAIS361034 (1 µM) for varied durations as indicated.
  Densitometric analysis of Bcl-xL expressions is presented on the right. Each bar
  represents percentage data relative to 0 h. (G) A representative western blot analysis
  of Bcl-xL expression in NIH-3T3 cells after they were treated with SIAIS361034 (1
  µM) for 24 h followed by drug withdrawal and cultured for various durations as indicated
  without SIAIS361034. Densitometric analysis of Bcl-xL expressions is presented on
  the right. Each bar represents percentage data relative to Vehicle. (H) Pretreatment
  with ABT-263 (1 µM) reverses the Bcl-xL degradation induced by SIAIS361034. A representative
  western blot analysis of Bcl-xL is shown. The NIH-3T3 cells were untreated or pretreated
  with ABT-263 for 2 h and then were treated with or without SIAIS361034 as indicated
  for 24 h. (I, J) Pretreatment with Pomalidomide (10 µM) or MG132 (1 µM) reverses
  the Bcl-xL degradation induced by SIAIS361034. A representative western blot analysis
  of Bcl-xL is shown. The NIH-3T3 cells were untreated or pretreated with Pomalidomide
  or MG132 for 2 h and then were treated with or without SIAIS361034 as indicated
  for 24 h. β-tubulin was used as a protein loading control in all western blot analyses
  shown in D, E, F, G, H, I, and J.
