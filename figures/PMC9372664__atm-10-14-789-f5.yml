caption: 'The interaction between Wisp2, NF-κB and PPARγ. (A) Wisp2 and NF-κB interaction
  was confirmed in KGN cells by Co-IP. (B) Wisp2 modulated the binding of NF-κB and
  downstream genes by Chip-qPCR. (C) Co-localization of p65 in KGN cells, determined
  by immunofluorescence detection and confocal photography. (D) Luciferase activity
  of KGN cells transfected with PPARγ WT, PPARγ MUT, Wisp2 overexpressed plasmid,
  vector, or blank plasmid, alone or in combination. n=3. Data are exhibited as mean
  ± SD. *P<0.05 vs. Vector + PPARγ-WT. #P<0.05 vs. Vector + PPARγ-WT and Wisp2 + PPARγ-WT.
  Co-IP, co-immunoprecipitation; ChIP-qPCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation polymerase
  chain reaction; SD, standard deviation.'
