caption: 'Paxlovid triggers evident ER stress in the ATDC5 cells. A Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed
  genes presented as a bubble chart. B Gene set enrichment analysis of genes involved
  in the KEGG biological process: Endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response.
  C Heatmap of mRNA expression of ER stress-related genes. D mRNA expression of ER
  stress-related genes when treated with different concentrations of Paxlovid. E,
  F Western blot with quantitative analysis of ER stress-related genes after treatment
  with Paxlovid. G Alcian blue and toluidine blue staining show the rescue effect
  of GSK2606414 on extracellular matrix protein secretion. H Western blot results
  reveal the rescue effect of GSK2606414 on the protein expression of Ddit3 and Sox9.
