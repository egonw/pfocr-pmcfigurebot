caption: Knock-down of miR-26a-3p in hippocampus caused behavioral disorders in rats.
  A The expression of miR-26a-3p in CA1 hippocampal region in animal models. B The
  expression of miR-26a-3p in DG hippocampal region in animal models. C The expression
  of miR-26a-3p in vmPFC in animal models. D Schematics of AAV vectors engineered
  to knock-down miR-26a-3p and the experimental paradigm. E Illustration of AAV viral
  infusion into the hippocampal region. Scale bar is 2 mm. F Expression level of miR-26a-3p
  in the hippocampus. G Motion traces of rats in the open field test (OFT). H Total
  distance in the OFT was decreased after knock-down of miR-26a-3p. I Time spent exploring
  the center area was decreased after knock-down of miR-26a-3p. J Motion traces of
  rats in the elevated plus maze (EPM). K The number of entering open arms was decreased
  in miR-26a-3p knock-down rats. L Time spent in the open arms (%) was decreased in
  miR-26a-3p knock-down rats. M The immobility times in forced swim test (FST) were
  increased in miR-26a-3p knock-down rats. N The swimming times in FST was decreased
  in miR-26a-3p knock-down rats. O The percent of sucrose consumption was decreased
  in sucrose preference test. Data are presented as the means ± SEMs. N = 8 per group.
