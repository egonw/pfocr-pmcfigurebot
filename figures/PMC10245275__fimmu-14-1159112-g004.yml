caption: 'The metabolic pathway enrichment analysis of differential metabolites and
  correlation analyses of differential metabolites and altered microbial species.
  (A) Differential metabolic pathway using KEGG metabolic pathway enrichment analysis
  (left: LC-MS; right: GC-MS). (B) Spearman correlations between the 20 most differential
  nasal microbial species and 20 nasal metabolites presented as a heatmap (above:
  LC-MS; below: GC-MS). Red and blue squares indicated positive and negative correlations,
  respectively. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; *** P < 0.001.'
