caption: Transient inhibition of the JNK pathway promoted HSC quiescence, preventing
  HSCs from undergoing cell cycle entry and metabolic activation. (A) Heatmap showing
  gene expression in DMSO-treated, uncultured, and JNK-IN-8-treated CB CD34+ cells.
  (B) Expression by RNA-seq of the indicated genes in DMSO-treated, uncultured, and
  JNK-IN-8-treated CB CD34+ cells. The fpkm value for uncultured cells is normalized
  to 1.0; n = 2. (C and D) GSEA plots showing enrichment of quiescent-HSC-enriched
  (C) and 120 HSC-associated (D) gene sets in the indicated groups. DMSO, DMSO-treated
  CB CD34+ cells; uncultured, uncultured CB CD34+ cells; JNK-IN-8, JNK-IN-8-treated
  CB CD34+ cells. Each group contained 2 replicates. (E) Bar plot showing the cell
  cycle status of DMSO-treated, uncultured, and JNK-IN-8-treated CB CD34+ cells (n
  = 3). (F and G) Representative FACS plots (F) and bar plot (G) showing glucose uptake
  activity (indicated by the fluorescence intensity of 2-NBDG) of DMSO-treated, uncultured,
  and JNK-IN-8-treated CB CD34+ cells (n = 3). (H and I) Representative FACS plots
  (H) and bar plot (I) showing ROS levels (indicated by the fluorescence intensity
  of DCFDA) of DMSO-treated, uncultured, and JNK-IN-8-treated CB CD34+ cells (n =
  3). (J) Schematic of the proposed model demonstrating how transient JNK inhibition
  regulates CB HSPC engraftment through its roles in quiescence and stemness. All
  data are shown as the mean value Â± SD. Statistical significance was assessed using
  one-way ANOVA if not mentioned. ns, not significant; **P <.01; ***P < .001; ****P
  < .0001.
