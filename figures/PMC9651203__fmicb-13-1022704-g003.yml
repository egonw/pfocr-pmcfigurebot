caption: Top 10 significant protein-protein interaction networks. (A) The top 10 MCODE
  complexes formed by the 520 proteins from the pulled list of the 5 analyzed cell
  lines. The PPI included the mRNA splicing pathway (MCODE1 and 7), the nonsense-mediated
  decay (NMD) (MCODE2), the effect of progerin on the involved genes in Hutchinson-Gilford
  Progeria Syndrome (MCODE3), the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex (MCODE4), Large
  Drosha complex (MCODE5), chromatin remodeling complex (MCODE6), DNA repair pathways
  (MCODE8), stress granule assembly (MCODE9), and protein-DNA complex subunit organization
  (MCODE10). The mRNA splicing pathway was the most significant. P-value in Log 10
  are given in parenthesis in the Legend and in . In the Legend R = Reactome, WP =
  WikiPathways, GO = GO term. (B) The network nodes are displayed as pie. Color code
  for pie sector represents a protein list from each of the five analyzed cell lines.
  The keys codes for the MCODEs shown in this figure are listed in , together with
  their correspondent p-value.
