caption: The signaling cascades of MAPK, PI3K, and canonical WNT pathways. (A) The
  NRAS-BRAF MAPK pathway is activated by binding a growth factor (GF) or mitogen to
  an RTK. Upon activation, the RAS protein phosphorylates (P) MEK1/2, phosphorylating
  ERK1/2. ERK can then translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription factors
  which promote proliferation and progression through the cell cycle. NF1 hampers
  this cell cycle progression by converting RAS to its inactive GDP-bound form. (B)
  The activation of PI3K signaling by GTP-bound RAS. PI3K activates AKT through phosphorylation
  using a second messenger (PIP3 not shown). AKT is a kinase that mediates the phosphorylation
  of protein substrates, subsequently affecting the cell cycle and survival of the
  tumor cell. PTEN acts as a suppressor of this pathway by dephosphorylating PIP3,
  thereby blocking the activation of AKT. (C) The canonical WNT signaling pathway
  and its main effector, β-catenin (β). β-Catenin is activated upon binding a WNT
  ligand to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), whereby it is prevented from degradation
  and instead accumulates in the cytoplasm. β-Catenin then relocates to the nucleus,
  where it acts as a co-activator of transcription of genes such as those related
  to EMT-like phenotype switching. Created with BioRender.com (accessed on 19 September
