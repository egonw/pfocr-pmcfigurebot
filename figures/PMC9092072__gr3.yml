caption: 'Intratumoral CXCL9 and IL-12 combination increases tumor immunogenicity
  by modulating the TME, leading to expansion of splenic antigen-specific CD8 cells(A)
  Schematic showing sequential treatment regimen to assess tumor regression and monitor
  immune response. CT26 tumor-bearing mice were intratumorally electroporated with
  a low but immunologically active dose of pIL12 (2 μg, day 0) followed by IT-EP of
  100 μg of either pCXCL9 or EV (days 4 and 7). Tumor and splenocytes were harvested
  2 days after last EP (i.e., day 9) for NanoString and flow-based analysis. (B) Gene
  expression changes in electroporated CT26 lesions were assessed by NanoString nCounter
  technology (mouse PanCancer IO360 panel) with pathway scores. Pathway scores follow
  the assumptions of equal variance and normal distribution of t scores. Ordinary
  one-way ANOVA was used to calculate significance compared with the empty-vector-treated
  group (∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.009). GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; MHC1, major histocompatibility
  complex 1. (C) Left: representative plots demonstrating enrichment of antigen-specific
  CD8 T cells (AH1+CD8+) in mice 9 days after treatment with pIL12 + pCXCL9 compared
  with pIL12 alone or EV on Singlets > Live > CD3+CD4- splenocytes. Right: increase
  in the percentage of AH1+ CD8+ T cells compared with empty-vector control (n = 3,
  3–5 animals/group; ∗p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA).'

  of plasmid CXCL9 synergizes with plasmid IL-12 therapy to elicit robust anti-tumor
