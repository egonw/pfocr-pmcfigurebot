caption: Knockdown of TRAF6 inhibits the development of pancreatitis. (a) 24 h after
  transfection of TRAF6-siRNA, qPCR detects the knockdown efficiency of siRNA on TRAF6
  in 10 nM cerulein-induced AR42J cells. (b) 48 h after transfection of TRAF6-siRNA,
  WB detected the knockdown efficiency of siRNA on TRAF6 in 10 nM cerulein-induced
  AR42J cells. Band analysis software is ImageJ (version 1.8.0_172). (c–e) The levels
  of inflammatory factors in the culture medium were detected by ELISA in 10 nM cerulein-induced
  AR42J cells. (f) CCK8 detected the effect of TRAF6 knockdown on cell proliferation
  in 10 nM cerulein-induced AR42J cells. (g) FCM detected the influence of TRAF6 knockdown
  on cell death in 10 nM cerulein-induced AR42J cells. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and
  ∗∗∗p < 0.001. The experiments were repeated three times, the statistical test was
  a two-tailed test, and errors bars in the figures represent standard deviation (SD).
