caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis of CD4+ T cellsscRNAseq was performed to assess
  the transcriptomes of T4 PBMCs from 4 matched controls and low responders (pairs
  12–15).(A) UMAP showing identification of immune cell subsets (see ).(B) Genes differentially
  expressed by CD4+T cells from controls and low responders.(C) IPA canonical pathway
  analysis of genes differentially expressed by CD4+T cells from controls and low
  responders.(D) IPA upstream pathway analysis was employed to predict signaling pathways
  driving the changes in canonical pathways. Only pathways analyzed by IPA with a
  p<0.0001 are in the figure. Please refer to  for the entire list.
