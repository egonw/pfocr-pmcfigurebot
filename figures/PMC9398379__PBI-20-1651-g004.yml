caption: 'Schematic presentation of biosynthetic pathways leading to the Phe‐derived
  aroma compounds in plants. L‐phenylalanine (Phe) is synthesized in the plastid or
  in the cytosol from chorismate generated via the shikimate pathway. Key enzymes
  in vanillin and raspberry ketone biosynthesis are in magenta. Enzymes involved in
  the production of other Phe‐derived aroma compounds are in blue, and transcription
  factors are in red. Dark red, green, orange, and purple indicate aroma compounds
  originating from the phenylpropanoid‐related (C6–C2), benzenoid (C6–C1), phenylpropene
  (C6–C3), and phenylbutanone (C6–C4) branches, respectively. Solid arrows indicate
  established biochemical steps, and dashed arrows indicate hypothetical steps. Stacked
  arrows represent multiple enzymatic steps. Abbreviations: BAR, benzaldehyde reductase;
  BAS, benzalacetone synthase; BA2H, benzoic acid 2‐hydroxylase; BALDH, benzaldehyde
  dehydrogenase; BEAT, acetyl‐CoA:benzylalcohol acetyltransferase; BPBT, benzoyl‐CoA:benzylalcohol/2‐phenylethanol
  benzoyltransferase; BSMT, benzoic acid/salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase;
  C3H, p‐coumarate 3‐hydroxylase; C4H, cinnamate 4‐hydroxylase; CAD, cinnamyl alcohol
  dehydrogenase; CAR, carboxylic acid reductase; CCR, cinnamyl‐CoA reductase; CFAT,
  coniferyl alcohol acetyltransferase; 4CL, 4‐ coumarate‐CoA ligase; CM 1/2, chorismate
  mutase 1/2; CNL, cinnamoyl‐CoA ligase; DAHPS, 3‐deoxy‐D‐arabino‐heptulosonate 7‐phosphate
  synthase; E4P, erythrose 4‐phosphate; EGS, eugenol synthase; HBS, hydroxybenzaldehyde
  synthase; IGS, isoeugenol synthase; OMT, O‐methyltransferase; PAR, phenylacetaldehyde
  reductase; PAAS, phenylacetaldehyde synthase; PAL, phenylalanine ammonia‐lyase;
  PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PES, 1‐phenylethanol synthase, PIP, pinoresinol−lariciresinol
  reductase, isoflavone reductase, phenylcoumaran benzylic ether reductase; RZS1,
