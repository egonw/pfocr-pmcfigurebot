caption: Effect of stichloroside C2 (STC2) on MAPK pathway-related protein expression
  in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. (a) MDA-MB-231 and 4 T1 cells were
  treated with different concentrations of STC2 (0.25, 0.5, and 1 μM) for 6 h. Western
  blotting was used to detect the protein expression and phosphorylation levels of
  p38, JNK, ERK1/2, and Akt, the main subfamilies of the MAPK signalling pathway family.
  (b) Data are presented as the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments ∗∗P <
  0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, compared to the control group.
