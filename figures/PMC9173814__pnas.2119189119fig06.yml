caption: Enhanced extracellular cGAMP exacerbates radiation-induced inflammation.
  (A–D) Enpp1WT and Enpp1H362A mice were irradiated with 8 or 9 Gy of total body irradiation
  and then weighed daily. Mice were euthanized if they exhibited greater than 20%
  weight loss for 2 consecutive days; n = 11 mice per genotype (6 mice at 8 Gy and
  5 mice at 9 Gy). (A) Kaplan–Meier plot showing the probability of survival for each
  genotype. P value was calculated using a log rank (Mantel–Cox) test. (B) Blood was
  drawn from each mouse 5 d postirradiation. Plasma IFN-β concentration was determined
  using a high-sensitivity IFN-β ELISA. P value was calculated using an unpaired t
  test. (C and D) Spleens were harvested from euthanized mice at experiment endpoint.
  RNA was extracted and qRT-PCR was used to determine expression levels of Ifnb1 (C)
  and Irf7 (D). One splenic H362A sample was excluded from C and D as an outlier based
  on the ROUT method (Q = 1%). (E–H) Sting1−/− and Sting1−/−/Enpp1H362A mice were
  irradiated with 9 Gy of total body irradiation and then weighed daily; n = 6 mice
  per genotype. Procedures described in A–D were repeated to obtain plasma IFN-β concentrations
  (F) and splenic expression levels of Ifnb1 (G) and Irf7 (H). P values were calculated
  using an unpaired t test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001. (I) Model of cGAMP
  as a paracrine immunotransmitter regulated by ENPP1 during viral infection and radiation-induced
  inflammation. Infected or irradiated cells produce and export cGAMP in response
  to cytosolic double-stranded DNA. When ENPP1WT is present, extracellular cGAMP is
  degraded, diminishing STING pathway activation. When cGAMP-specific ENPP1H362A is
  present, extracellular cGAMP accumulates, leading to an enhanced response to viral
  infection or an exacerbated response to radiation-induced inflammation.

  of attenuating STING signaling.
