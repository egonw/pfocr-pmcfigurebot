figure_title: From null distribution to p-value for DWPCs
caption: Null DWPC distributions are shown for three metapaths between Alzheimer’s
  disease and the circadian rhythm pathway, selected from . For each metapath, null
  DWPCs are computed on 200 permuted hetnets and grouped according to source–target
  degree. Histograms show the null DWPCs for the degree group corresponding to Alzheimer’s
  disease and the circadian rhythm pathway (as noted in the plot titles by deg.) The
  proportion of null DWPCs that were zero is calculated, forming the “hurdle” of the
  null distribution model. The nonzero null DWPCs are modeled using a gamma distribution,
  which can be fit solely from a sample mean and standard deviation. The mean of nonzero
  null DWPCs is denoted with a diamond, with the standard deviation plotted twice
  as a line in either direction. Actual DWPCs are compared to the gamma-hurdle null
  distribution to yield a p-value.
