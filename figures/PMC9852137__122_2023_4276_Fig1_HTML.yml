caption: 'Identification of tetraploid wheat hyd mutants. a A simplified carotenoid
  biosynthetic pathway in wheat. Enzymes are indicated in bold. PSY, phytoene synthase;
  PDS, phytoene desaturase; ZISO, ζ-carotene isomerase; ZDS, ζ-carotene desaturase;
  CRTISO, carotenoid isomerase; LCYb, lycopene β-cyclase; LCYe, lycopene ε-cyclase;
  HYD, β-hydroxylase (non-heme di-iron type); CYP, cytochrome P450 type carotenoid
  hydroxylase; CCD, carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase. Enzyme activities blocked in
  the mutants are indicated in red. b Location of mutations within the HYD homoeologs
  in the tetraploid wheat mutants. The mutated nucleotides are highlighted in red.
  c Derived Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequence (dCAPS) markers of HYD-A1 and HYD-B1 (WT:
  Wild type, HT: Heterozygous mutant, HM: Homozygous mutant). Markers of HYD-A2 and
  HYD-B2 were published previously (Yu et al. )'
