caption: VEGF-mediated gene regulation and pathway enrichment in HRMECs. Visualization
  of the VEGF-mediated genes (VEGF-treated control siRNA-transfected HRMECs (CV) group
  compared to the PBS-treated control siRNA-transfected HRMECs (C) group) by volcano
  plot from (A) the STAT3 RNA-seq dataset or (B) the KDR RNA-seq dataset (black dashed
  line represents significance threshold value of âˆ’log(adjusted p-value) = 1.30, color
  gradient visually depicts the fold of gene upregulation (red) and downregulation
  (blue) in the CV group compared to the C group); bubble plots depicting the significantly
  enriched and significantly activated or inactivated pathways associated with the
  VEGF-mediated genes from (C) the STAT3 RNA-seq data or (D) the KDR RNA-seq dataset
  (size of bubble directly correlates with the significance of pathway enrichment,
  color gradient visually depicts the predicted strength of activation (red) or inhibition
  (blue) of enriched pathways by IPA, gene ratio (x-axis label) was calculated by
  taking the number of genes from the uploaded dataset that was associated with the
  Canonical Pathways (y-axis labels), and dividing it by the total number of genes
  from the IPA knowledge database associated with the respective Canonical Pathway);
  (E) visualization of the common or unique VEGF-mediated genes between the two RNA-seq
  datasets by a Venn diagram (color gradient visually depicts relatively higher number
  of gene counts (red) or relatively lower number of gene counts (blue).
