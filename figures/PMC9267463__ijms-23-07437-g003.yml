caption: The potential landscape for breast cancer progression and epigenetic switches
  involved in the emergence of resistance. The recent characterization of the transcriptomic
  profiles in the normal breast suggests the existence of five cellular states derived
  from a basal stem cell that differentiates into a myoepithelial cell or a luminal
  progenitor, from which two types of luminal cells arise. The information from this
  pathway of differentiation was used to illustrate the cellular heterogeneity and
  their relative hierarchy within the normal breast. Then, breast cancer subtypes
  were located according to their molecular profile in the basin of the normal transcriptional-related
  counterpart to highlight that complexity and the heterogeneity of breast carcinogenesis
  may be understood as the reversion of differentiation. Finally, some of the reviewed
  events of dedifferentiation in response to cancer therapy are depicted in purple
  arrows. Remarkably, the processes of cellular senescence and EMT are also involved
  in triggering the epigenetic switches among the molecular subtypes of breast cancers.
