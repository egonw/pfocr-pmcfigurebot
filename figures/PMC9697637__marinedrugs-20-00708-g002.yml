caption: Beta-amyloid and tau protein in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease.
  (А) Diagram of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing pathway. AICD—APP
  intracellular fragment; P3—carboxyterminal fragment P3; sAPP-α and sAPPβ—soluble
  APP-fragments; C83—carboxyterminal fragment 83; C99—carboxyterminal fragment 99;
  Aβ—amyloid beta peptides (Aβ40/Aβ42). (B) Aβ fragments oligomerize and fibrillize
  to form amyloid plaques leading to AD pathology. (C) Hyperphosphorylation of tau
  protein causes microtubule depolarization; aggregates of tau oligomers assemble
  to form neurofibrillary tangles leading to loss of dendritic spines and deterioration
  of synaptic plasticity. Created with BioRender.com.
