caption: 'Expression of KL, NF-κB, and IKK in microglia. (a) KL gene expression in
  microglia. (b) KL, NF-κB, and IKK protein expression in microglia. The quantitative
  analysis of protein KL (c), NF-κB (d), and IKK (e) was shown. One-way ANOVA assay
  was used for pairwise comparison. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 vs control.'
