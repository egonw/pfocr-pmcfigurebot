  culturesInference quality measured by the Absolute Relative Error  of internal fluxes,  and  for
  all experimental conditions. The reactions are grouped by subsystems, from left
  to right: glucose transport, biomass, glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, Krebs
  cycle, and glyoxylate cycle. Reaction acronyms are taken from., is the error of
  flux  across  samples . Large ARE values are cut to 1.'
