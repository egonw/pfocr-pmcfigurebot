caption: 'Mechanism of EMT-mediated chemotherapy resistance: Tumor-associated genes
  can induce EMT to mediate chemotherapy resistance of tumor cells. Mir-137 can inhibit
  the expression of target protein DUSP4 and induce EMT, which activates vimentin;
  exosomal Mir-155 can target the expression of FOXO3a and up-regulate the expression
  of β-catenin and Twist; lncRNA HOXA-AS3 can inhibit the expression of HOXA3 and
  up-regulate the expression of Twist, as well as participating in mediating adriamycin
  and cisplatin drug resistance; tumor-associated protein GPR30 can induce EMT and
  mediate cisplatin resistance. The tumor-related protein Snail regulates ABCB1 expression,
  induces EMT, and mediates 5-FU resistance. At the same time, 5-FU combined with
  AS1517499 and Trim inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT-6, up-regulated the expression
  of E-cadherin, and down-regulated the expression of Snail and β-catenin, delaying
  the progression of EMT, and enhanced the sensitivity of 5-FU to EMT-mediated chemotherapy
  resistance. Mir-135b-5p can target the expression of IGTA2, down-regulate the MAPK/ERK
  signaling pathway, delay the progression of EMT, and enhance the sensitivity of
  5-FU.'
