caption: Plant ethylene signaling leads to the expression of genes, leading to waterlogging
  adaptations. Constantly produced ethylene is trapped in submerged tissues due to
  the low diffusion of nonpolar gases in water and cannot escape into the atmosphere.
  Ethylene is then bound by ethylene receptors, inhibiting their activity. In the
  canonical pathway, ethylene receptors bind ethylene preventing them from activating
  constitutive triple response 1 (CTR1). Inactive CTR1 kinase no longer phosphorylates
  ethylene-insensitive 2 (EIN2), leading to its activation and following the activation
  of hypoxia transcription factors. The non-canonical pathway (marked by a dotted
  line) starts with a suppressed ETR1 receptor, which no longer activates CTR1 phosphorylates
  Arabidopsis histidine-containing phosphotransfer proteins (AHPs) (linking the ethylene
  sensing with cytokine signaling), which in turn activate Arabidopsis response regulators
  (ARR) by phosphotransfer. ARRs regulate the expression of waterlogging response
  genes. Prepared based on [,]. The red arrows demonstrate inhibition and the green
  arrows represent induction.
