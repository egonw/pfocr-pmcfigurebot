caption: TP significantly downregulated the expression of SPTLC2 in HUVECs. (a) HUVECs
  were treated with TP (25 nM) for 24 h, and the changes in related genes were screened
  by PCR array assay. The results are shown as the absolute value of ΔCt. (b) HUVECs
  were treated with TP (25 nM) for 24 h, and the expression of SPTLC2 mRNA was detected
  by RT-PCR assay. (c) HUVECs were treated with TP (0, 12.5, 25, or 50 nM) and DMSO
  (negative control) for 24 h, and the protein expression of SPTLC2 in HUVECs was
  detected by western blotting assay. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 versus the control group.
