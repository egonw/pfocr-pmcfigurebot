caption: Schematic representation of the DDR pathway and DDR inhibitors used in preclinical
  and clinical settings in melanoma. Single strand break (SSB) is recognized by the
  RPA complex, which leads to the activation of ATR and CHK1. The latter promotes
  phosphorylation and inactivation of the phosphatases CDC25A and CDC25C, which are
  involved in dephosphorylation and activation of CDK2 and CDK1, respectively. CHK1
  may also be activated by ATM. WEE1 regulates the CDKs activity in a negative manner,
  playing an essential role in controlling S and M phase entry. The MRN complex recognizes
  double strand break (DSB), and activates ATM. CHK2 and p53 are the main targets
  of ATM. Upon activation, CHK2 and p53 can lead to either cell cycle block or apoptosis.
  Active ATM can also phosphorylate H2AX, which can lead to DNA repair. During SSB
  formation, ATR can also activate CHK2. PARP, ATR, CHK1, ATM and WEE1 inhibitors
  are indicated in red. More information about these inhibitors is reported in the
  main text. DSB can also activate the NHEJ pathway, whose main components include
  KU70/80, DNA-PK and LIG4/XRCC4. P with red circles stands for phosphorylation.
