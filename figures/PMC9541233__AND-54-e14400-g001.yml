caption: 'Perturbation in germline methylation/epigenetic process in the male embryo:
  the impact of UMFA and oxidative stress. (1) Weak DHFR activity (Bailey & Ayling,
  ) blocks the entry of UMFA into the folate cycle and leads to a Michaelis and Menten
  effect, a vicious cycle that further inhibits DHFR activity. (2) MTHFR SNPs (Methylenetetrahydrofolate
  Reductase single nucleotide polymorphisms), especially T677T, reduce MTHFR activity
  and impair the formation of 5‐MTHF (5 methyl tetrahydrofolate). The cycle pathway
  between THF and 5‐MTHF can be completely blocked; the cycle can be reversed with
  an accumulation of UMFA. (3) UMFA and active natural folate 5‐MTHF compete for receptor
  and transporters (Smith et al. ) in order to enter cells, and this exacerbates the
  situation by decreasing the availability of the natural folate for homocysteine
  regeneration. (4) EDCs (endocrine disruptor chemicals) exacerbate a process of undue
  demethylation via oxidative stress (Menezo et al., ). DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase;
  FolR1, folate receptor 1; MS, methionine synthase; MTHFR, methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase; SAH, S‐adenosyl homocysteine; SAM, S‐adenosyl‐Methionine; SLC19A1 and
  A1, folates transporters; THF, tetrahydrofolate'
