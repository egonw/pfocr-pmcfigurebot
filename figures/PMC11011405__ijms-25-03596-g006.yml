caption: Combined analysis of DEGs and DEPs. (A) A nine-quadrant diagram of protein
  and mRNA associations. Each point represents one gene. Quadrants 1 and 9 indicate
  the genes negatively correlated with proteins. Quadrants 3 and 7 show the genes
  positively correlated with proteins. (B) Venn diagram illustrating the shared KEGG
  pathway in the treatment and control groups. (C) p-value heatmap. (D) KEGG enrichment
  analysis of DEGs with same expression trend as DEPs. Horizontal coordinate indicates
  the functional enrichment factor (rich factor), vertical coordinate indicates the
  negative logarithmic transformation of the p-value of the enrichment significance.
  Each circle in the figure indicates a pathway, which is denoted by different colors,
  and the size of the circle indicates the count.
