caption: circ_0007707 regulates PDGFD expression through acting as a miR-429 sponge
  in GC. (a) qPCR was utilized to detect miR-429 expression upon transfection of OE-circ-0007707
  in AGS cells. (b) qPCR was utilized to detect PDGFD mRNA expression upon transfection
  of OE-circ-0007707 in AGS cells. (c) Western blot assay was utilized to detect PDGFD
  protein expression in gastric cancer tissues and adjacent tissues. (d) Kaplanâ€“Meier
  curve of PDGFD that significantly correlated with overall survival of gastric cancer
  patients.
