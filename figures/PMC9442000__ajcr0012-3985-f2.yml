caption: Prognostic value of BUFAS in COAD. (A) The overall survival (OS) of colon
  cancer patients compared between the high- and low-BUFAS groups, with the Kaplan-Meier
  survival curves showing the longer OS in patients with high-BUFAS (3042 vs. 1881
  days). (B, C) The univariable (B) and multivariable (C) analyses of the BUFAS and
  the clinical characteristics in the TCGA-COAD dataset. (D) The OS of colon cancer
  patients compared between the high- and low-BUFAS groups, with the Kaplan-Meier
  survival curves showing the longer OS in patients with high-BUFAS (4350 vs. 3180
  days). (E, F) The univariable (B) and multivariable (C) analyses of the BUFAS and
  clinical characteristics in the GSE39582 dataset. HR, hazard ratio; 95% CI, 95%
  confidence interval.
