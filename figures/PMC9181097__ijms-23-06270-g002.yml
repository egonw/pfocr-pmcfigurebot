caption: (A) In the course of NASH progression, chronic inflammation is induced by
  oxidative stress in which reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipotoxicity exacerbated
  by ROS, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP), and damage-associated molecular
  patterns (DAMP) such as lipopolysaccharides, adipokines, and insulin resistance
  promote fibrosis progression to cirrhosis, with shifting of hepatocytic Smad3 phospho-isoform
  signaling from tumor suppression to carcinogenesis, increasing risk of HCC. ECM,
  extracellular matrix. (B) Even in the absence of chronic inflammation and progressive
  fibrosis, an inflammation-independent process of hepatic carcinogenesis may occur
  as a result of genetic or epigenetic alteration. In such situations, direct DNA
  damage may occur from insulin resistance and lipotoxicity, as well as ROS caused
  by oxidative stress. Thus, mutations in key pathway components lead to sustained
  linker phosphorylation of Smad3, impairing sensitivity to growth inhibition by pSmad3C.
