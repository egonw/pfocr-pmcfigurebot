caption: 'Genes involved in WNT signaling are partially downregulated in U343 PCDHGC3
  knockout cells. Different passages of wild type (WT) and PCDHGC3 knockout (KO) U343
  cells were used for RNA isolation and mRNA analysis by real-time PCR. Target gene
  expression was normalized to the endogenous control. Data are presented as mean
  ± standard deviation of n = 4. Statistical significance is indicated by p < 0.05,
  as measured by the Mann–Whitney test. CTNNB1: β-Catenin; DKK1: Dickkopf WNT Signaling
  Pathway Inhibitor; FZD2, 9, 10: Fizzled Class Receptor 2, 9, 10; LRP5, 6: LDL Receptor
  Related Protein 5, 6; WNT6: WNT Family Member 6.'
