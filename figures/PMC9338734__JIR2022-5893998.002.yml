caption: Unsupervised cluster analysis of Ferr-associated prognostic lncRNAs. (a)
  Interactions among lncRNAs in TC. The line connecting the genes represents their
  interaction, with the line thickness indicating the strength of the association
  between genes. Green and pink represent negative and positive correlations, respectively.
  (b) Consensus clustering matrix for k = 2. (c) K-M survival curves of overall survival
  (OS) in C1 and C2 clusters. (d) PCA analysis shows a discriminable dimension between
  the two clusters. (e) GSEA results show significant enrichment of apoptosis pathway
  and p53 pathway in cluster1. (f) Differences in clinicopathologic features and expression
  levels of lncRNAs between the two clusters.
