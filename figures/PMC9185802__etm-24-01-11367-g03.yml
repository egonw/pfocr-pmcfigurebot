caption: miR-382-3p inhibition upregulates AKT SUMOylation and activates the AKT signaling
  pathway. (A) Immunoblotting was used to detect the levels of full-scale SUMOylation,
  SUMO1, AKT and p-AKT in tumor and non-tumor control samples. (B) A549 and H1299
  cells were transfected with miR-382-3p inhibitor for 48 h. The cells were then subjected
  to RT-qPCR and immunoblotting. (C) The expression of AKT signaling downstream genes
  was examined by RT-qPCR. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 vs. control. miR, microRNA;
  RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR; p-AKT, phosphorylated AKT; T, tumor
  tissue; N, normal tissue; IP, immunoprecipitation; IB, immunoblot; CCND1, cyclin
  D1; CDK2, cyclin-dependent kinase 2; SUMO1, small ubiquitin-like modifier 1.
