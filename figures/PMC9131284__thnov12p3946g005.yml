caption: Functional analysis of the 50 top up-regulated lncRNAs by SARS-CoV-2 infection
  considering their validated interactions with RNA-binding proteins retrieved from
  ENCORI database . A, GO-term enrichment analysis for biological processes of the
  RNA-binding proteins that interact with the selected overexpressed lncRNAs in SARS-CoV-2
  patients with high viral loads; B, pathway enrichment analysis using the KEGG database
  and considering the RNA-binding proteins that interact with the selected overexpressed
  lncRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 patients with high viral loads; C, interaction map between
  RNA-binding proteins and the 50 top overexpressed lncRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 patients
  with high viral loads. The number of interactions is depicted as circles with a
  diameter proportional to the number of RNA-binding sites in each lncRNA. The right-hand
  side panel represents the density of RBP binding sites per 1000 nucleotides in each
  lncRNA as extracted from the ENCORI database.
article_title: The interplay between lncRNAs, RNA-binding proteins and viral genome
  during SARS-CoV-2 infection reveals strong connections with regulatory events involved
  in RNA metabolism and immune response.
