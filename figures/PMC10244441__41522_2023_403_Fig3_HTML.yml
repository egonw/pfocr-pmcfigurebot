  in H-FMT GF mice vs D-FMT GF mice
caption: 'A Body weights of mice during the experimental period. B Levels of WBC,
  LYM, NEU, MON, LYM%, NEU%, and MON% in the blood of experimental mice. C Volcano
  plot of differential genes in five intestinal segments. Blue denotes genes that
  are significantly downregulated in the D-FMT group, and red denotes genes that are
  significantly upregulated in the D-FMT group. D KEGG signaling pathways enriched
  in five intestinal segment differential genes. The sizes of the circles represent
  the number of genes enriched in the pathway, and the color is related to P_adjust.
  n = 10 for A, B; n = 4 for C, D. Data were expressed as the means ± SEM (A, B) and
  one-way ANOVA was performed, followed by LSD’s test (A, B). *P < 0.05: H-FMT group
  vs D-FMT group.'
