caption: 'PPI suppressed the differentiation capability and promoted the apoptosis
  of LCSCs. (a) A tumor sphere differentiation experiment was performed to evaluate
  the effect of PPI on the differentiation potential of LCSCs. (b) Hoechst 33258 staining
  was used to detect the inhibition of LCSC proliferation by PPI. ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P
  < 0.01vs. the control group; #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01vs. the Sora group.'
