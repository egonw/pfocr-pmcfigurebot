caption: 'Structural diversity of α-Syn. Helical conformation of α-Syn bound to a
  membrane and intrinsically disordered α-Syn in solution are presented in the middle.
  Positively charged amino acid residues are given in blue, and negative ones in red.
  Secondary structure propensity was obtained by predictor FELLS []. Helical projections
  of N-terminal α-helices (a total of 60 amino acid residues and the first twenty)
  are generated using the HeliQuest web server []. The arrow shows the helical hydrophobic
  moment. The protein structure was predicted using AlfaFold2 []. The 3D protein structure
  was visualised in PyMOL v2 (available at: https://pymol.org/2/; accessed on 16 April
  2022).'
