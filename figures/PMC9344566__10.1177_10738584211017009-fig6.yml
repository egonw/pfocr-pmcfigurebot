caption: Proposed channel blocking scheme for an ultra-hydrophobic compound. Hypothesis
  for block by local anesthetics (LAs) (based on , ; ). (a, b) The first two models
  are based on previous studies. (a) Voltage-gated sodium (Nav) states and transitions
  with charged drug molecules. Charged (hydrophilic) drug may come and go only while
  the gate is open. (b) Neutral (hydrophobic) drug can bind and unbind even if when
  the gate is closed. Therefore, two pathways exist for drug to reach its receptor
  in the pore. The hydrophilic pathway is closed when the gate is closed. (c) The
  third model is based on our results from our studies on CBD and Nav channels. The
  star indicates drug. We propose as the drug becomes more hydrophobic, its interaction
  with the channel transitions from only the open-state (O) to only interactions with
  rest (R) and inactivated (I) states.
