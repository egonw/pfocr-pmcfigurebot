caption: ADAM8 regulates HB-EGF/EGFR signal pathway. (A) Enrichment bubble figure
  indicates down-regulated genes of RNA sequencing of U87MG_scramble samples and U87MG_shA8
  samples, which are involved in specific signaling cascades. (B) Heatmap denotes
  the signatures enriched in “Bladder cancer” pathways. (C) mRNA levels of ADAM8 and
  HB-EGF in indicated GBM cell lines (U87MG and G1). (D) Protein levels of ADAM8,
  HB-EGF, and EGFR signaling cascades in indicated GBM cell lines (U87MG and G1).
  (E) Protein levels were measured by Image J and are statistically shown in the bar
  graph using an unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test. (F,G) Immunofluorescence staining
  of HB-EGF and p-EGFR of xenograft tissue sections, respectively. Scale bar = 100
  um. ns (non-significant) * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001.
