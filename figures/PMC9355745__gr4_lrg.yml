caption: SARS-COV-2 causes insulin resistance through multiple mechanisms. 1. COVID-19
  patients have been shown to have a downregulated REST transcription factor, which
  has been linked to altered expression of proteins important for the insulin signalling
  pathway. 2. SARS-COV-2 may cause downregulation of insulin signalling pathway through
  activation of serine/threonine kinases via RNA fragments and cytokine storm. 3.
  Viral activation of immune cells causes release of IFN-gamma, which has been shown
  to downregulate insulin receptors on skeletal muscle cells, exacerbating insulin
  resistance , , , , , .
