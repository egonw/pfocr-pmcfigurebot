figure_title: Inka2 depletion in the brain enhances the LIMK-Cofilin signaling cascade
  in synaptoneurosome
caption: (A) Schematic model of synaptoneurosome (SN). (Bâ€“D) Phosphorylation of LIMK
  and Cofilin were elevated in Inka2-/- SN. Total protein lysate of the cerebral cortex
  (Ctx lysate) and the SN fraction were prepared from wild-type or Inka2-/- and subjected
  to immunoblotting with anti-pCofilin, pLIMK, PSD95, and GAPDH antibodies. (C, D)
  Quantified comparison of pCofilin (C) and pLIMK (D) level normalized by GAPDH content.
  Five independent experiments were performed. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; Paired t-test.
  (E) Model for the Inka2 function in cortical neurons. Inka2, but not Inka1, inhibits
  Pak4 activity to suppress the LIMK/Cofilin pathway in neurons affecting dendritic
  spine formation and neuronal development via actin dynamics.
article_title: Inka2, a novel Pak4 inhibitor, regulates actin dynamics in neuronal
  development.
