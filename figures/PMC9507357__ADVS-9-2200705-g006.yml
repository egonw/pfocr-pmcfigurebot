caption: OVOL2 inhibits glycolytic gene expression and glycolysis. A) Heatmap of transcription
  factors and known hypoxia‐inducible glycolytic genes identified by RNA‐seq using
  MCF7 cells treated with hypoxia (1% O2) for indicated times. B) RT‐qPCR analysis
  of transcription factors and some known hypoxia‐inducible glycolytic genes identified
  in (A) in MCF7 cells treated with hypoxia for indicated times. C) Glucose uptake
  and lactate production in MCF7 cells transfected with the indicated FLAG‐tagged
  expression vectors or empty vector (EV). LDHA was used as a positive regulator of
  glucose uptake and lactate production, and p53 as a negative regulator of glucose
  uptake and lactate production. Typical immunoblot shows the expression of FLAG‐tagged
  proteins. α‐Tubulin was used as a loading control. D) Measurement of glucose uptake
  and lactate production in ZR75‐1 and MDA‐MB231 cells transfected with FLAG‐tagged
  OVOL2 (FLAG‐OVOL2) or EV. Representative immunoblot shows FLAG‐OVOL2 expression.
  E) Heatmap of glycolytic genes and known OVOL2 downstream target genes identified
  by RNA‐seq using OVOL2 wild‐type (WT) or knockout (KO) MCF7 cells. F) KEGG pathway
  analysis of genes differentially expressed between OVOL2 WT and KO MCF7 cells as
  in (E). G) RT‐qPCR and immunoblot analysis of glycolytic gene expression in OVOL2
  WT or KO MCF7 or MDA‐MB‐231 cells. To avoid potential off‐target effects of KO,
  the KO cells were stably infected with lentivirus carrying OVOL2. α‐Tubulin was
  used as a loading control for analyzing glycolytic gene expression. A schematic
  diagram of the aerobic glycolysis pathway is indicated on the left. H) RT‐qPCR and
  immunoblot analysis of glycolytic gene expression in OVOL2 WT or KO MEFs isolated
  from corresponding mouse. WT mice were littermates of the KO mice (n = 3). I) Representative
  immunoblot analysis of glycolytic gene expression in OVOL2 WT and KO mouse mammary
  tissues isolated from mammary‐specific OVOL2 KO mice generated by mating conditional
  OVOL2 KO mice with MMTV‐Cre transgenic mice. J) Measurement of glucose uptake and
  lactate production in OVOL2 WT or KO MEFs from (H). K,L) Cell proliferation curves
  of OVOL2 WT and KO MEFs (n = 3) cultured in media containing 25 mm glucose (K) or
  10 mm galactose (L). Data shown are mean ± standard deviation (SD) of triplicate
  measurements that have been repeated 3 times with similar results (B,C,G,H,K,L).
  Data shown are mean ± SD of quintuplicate measurements that have been repeated 3
  times with similar results (D,J). Two‐sided Student's t‐test was used to compare
  the means of two groups. When more than two groups were compared, one‐way ANOVA
  was performed. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 versus control cells or EV.
