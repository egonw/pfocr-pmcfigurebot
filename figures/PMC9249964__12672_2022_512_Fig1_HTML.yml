caption: Inverse correlation between miR-1307-5p expression and—bladder cancer clinical
  grades. A Expression levels of miR-1307-5p in clinical bladder cancer tissues versus
  normal bladder tissues, based on analysis of the GEO datasets. B Expression levels
  of miR-1307-5p in bladder cancer cell lines and a normal human bladder uroepithelium
  cell line was determined by RT–qPCR. C Loss of miR-1307-5p coincide with worse clinicopathological
  features, as analysis of the TCGA datasets. D miR-1307-5p expression in 20 paired
  bladder tumor tissues versus adjacent normal tissues. E RT–qPCR analysis—of miR-1307-5p
  in tumor tissues and matched normal tissues. F Kaplan–Meier’s analysis of clinical
  cases based on miR-1307-5p expression and overall survival rates. G Kaplan–Meier’s
  analysis of clinical cases based on miR-1307-5p expression and disease specific
  survival rates. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001. Data depicts
  the mean ± standard deviation and are representative of three independent experiments.
  TNM means tumor node metastasis. Low grade means part of grade 1 carcinomas and
  part of grade 2 carcinomas, High grade means part of grade 2 carcinomas and grade
  3 carcinomas
