caption: Gene Ontology term enrichment in the EZ and PIZ over the first 2 weeks of
  epileptogenesis. Significant DAVID pathway gene ontology terms are expressed over
  the first 2 weeks of epileptogenesis as heatmaps across the EZ and PIZ. (A) Enrichment
  of GO terms in the EZ, 3 days, 7 days, and 14 days after SE induction. (B) Enrichment
  of GO terms in the PIZ, 3 days, 7 days, and 14 days after SE induction. (C) Depiction
  of GO term enrichment in the PIZ of the most highly enriched GO terms in the EZ,
  demonstrating how GO terms enriched in the EZ are represented in the PIZ across
  the first 2 weeks of epileptogenesis.
