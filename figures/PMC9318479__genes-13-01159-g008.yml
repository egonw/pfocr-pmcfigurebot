caption: '(A) Clustering graph of the GO enrichment of differentially expressed lncRNA
  cis-target genes. (B) Clustering graph of the GO enrichment of differentially expressed
  lncRNA trans-target genes. (C) Cluster map of the KEGG enrichment of differentially
  expressed lncRNA cis-target genes (D) Cluster map of the KEGG enrichment of differentially
  expressed lncRNA trans-target genes. Note: Red indicates metabolic pathways with
  high expression, and green indicates metabolic pathways with relatively low expression.
  The parentheses after the label of each metabolic pathway include the number of
  genes with significant differences in the metabolic pathway.'
