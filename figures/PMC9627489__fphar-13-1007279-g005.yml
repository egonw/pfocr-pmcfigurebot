caption: 'CM inhibits the growth by inducing apoptosis of melanoma cells and inhibiting
  the PI3K/AKT pathway. (A) The western blotting was performed on the A375 (left)
  and MV3 cells (right) against PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, cleaved Caspase 9 (C-Caspase
  9), cleaved PARP (C-PARP), Bcl- 2, and Bax. (B) Heat map visualization of Log2 [relative
  protein level] in panel (A). (C) CM affected mRNA expression of Caspase 9, Bcl2,
  and Bax in A375 and MV3 cells analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. (D) Ki67 immunohistochemistry
  staining in tumor sections and the percent of Ki67 positive cells were calculated
  as the fraction of Ki67 positive cells compared to the total number of cells. (E)
  The effect of CTFs on apoptosis of tumor tissue by TUNEL. (F) Histopathological
  examination of H&E staining in tumor sections. The asterisks indicate statistically
  significant differences (*p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01). Ctrl: control. CM: Cortex Mori
  extracts.'
