caption: 'LINC00674 promotes the malignant behaviors of HCC cells. (A) The lentivirus
  mediated shNRAs targeting LINC00674 (shLINC#1 and shLINC#2) and non-targeting shRNA
  (NTC) were transduced into Hep3B and MHCC97H cells. RT-qPCR analysis was used to
  confirm the knockdown efficiency. (B) MTT assay was used to explore the effect of
  LINC00674 knockdown on HCC cell viability. (C) EdU assay was used to explore the
  effect of LINC00674 silencing on HCC cell proliferation. Scale bar: 50 Âµm. (D) Transwell
  assays were used to detect the effect of LINC00674 knockdown on HCC cell migration
  and invasion. *P<0.05.'
