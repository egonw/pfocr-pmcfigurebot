caption: The anti-FMDV activity of IFN-γ and inhibition of the expression of IFN-γ
  stimulated genes by FMDV. A PK-15 ​cells were separately pretreated with 0, 50,
  100, 200, 400 ​ng/mL porcine IFN-γ for 5 ​h and then infected with FMDV O/BY/CHA/2010 ​at
  an MOI of 0.1. 24 h later, TCID50 was determined on BHK-21 ​cells. B PK-15 ​cells
  infected with FMDV O/BY/CHA/2010 ​at an MOI of 0.1 for 24 ​h were treated with 0,
  50, 100, 200, 400 ​ng/mL porcine IFN-γ. 5 h later, TCID50 was determined on BHK-21 ​cells.
  C PK-15 ​cells were infected with FMDV O/BY/CHA/2010 ​at an MOI of 0.1 and growth
  kinetics was determined. PK-15 ​cells were inoculated with FMDV (D) or UV-inactivated
  FMDV (E) at an MOI of 0.1 for 24 ​h and then treated with porcine IFN-γ (200 ​ng/mL)
  for 5 ​h. The mRNA levels of poGBP2, poISG15, poISG56, poOAS and poPKR were examined
  using real-time RT-PCR. The levels of relative transcript were shown as relative
  fold changes, compared with the mock-treated control level of uninfected cells.
  Data represent the mean ​± ​the standard deviations (error bars) of three independent
  experiments. ∗, P ​< ​0.05.
