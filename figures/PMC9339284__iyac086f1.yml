caption: NuA4-dependent regulation of Acc1 activity is not solely through Snf1/AMPK1.
  a) Schematic of de novo synthesis pathway of FAs. The precursor of FA synthesis
  is acetyl-CoA. The essential enzyme Acc1 plays a direct role in regulating FA synthesis.
  Genetic manipulations of yeast cells (NuA4 mutants) or pharmacological inhibition
  (Sor A) impacting Acc1 activity can attenuate the synthesis of FAs. b) Deletion
  of the NuA4 subunit, EAF1, reduces the rate of triglyceride synthesis. Early-log
  phase wt (YKB 1079) and eaf1Δ (YKB 3333) cells were treated with [3H]-sodium acetate
  for 1 h before harvest and extraction. The lipogenesis rate was obtained by normalizing
  the incorporation of [3H] into triglycerides from [3H]-acetate precursor to the
  protein concentration obtained from the same cells. Error bars denote the standard
  error of the mean (SEM). n = 3, *P < 0.05 determined using a 2-tailed t-test. c)
  Acc1 activity is reduced in NuA4 mutant. Wild-type (YKB 3954) and eaf1Δ (YKB 4448)
  cells expressing endogenously tagged Acc1-GFP were grown to early-log phase at 30°C
  in YPD. Acc1-GFP was immunoprecipitated and Acc1 activity measured and normalized
  to Acc1-GFP protein abundance. Error bars denote the standard error of the mean
  (SEM). n = 3, *P < 0.05 determined using a 2-tailed t-test. d) eaf1Δ cells are sensitive
  to Sor A and eaf1Δ snf1Δ cells are more sensitive than snf1Δ cells. Wild-type (YKB
  1079), eaf1Δ (YKB 3333), snf1Δ (YKB 3389), and eaf1Δ snf1Δ (YKB 3421) cells were
  grown to early-log phase before being diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 in YPD with DMSO
  control or 0.4 µM Sor A in DMSO, and automated growth curve analysis was performed
  at 30°C for 48 h. e) Growth rates of indicated strains were calculated from logarithmic
  growth phase of curves in d. Error bars denote the standard error of the mean (SEM).
  n = 3, *P < 0.05 determined using a 2-way ANOVA test with a Tukey’s multiple comparisons
  test.
