caption: 'Post-myocardial infarction (MI) aerobic exercise training activates CHI3L1/PAR2-PI3K-AKT/ERK
  signaling pathway in the rat heart. (A) Representative pictures of western blotting
  indicating the protein levels of the relevant signaling molecules. (B) Quantitative
  analysis for CHI3L1 and PAR2 protein levels, and phosphorylation levels of PI3K,
  Akt and ERK in heart tissues (n = 3/group). (C) Relative mRNA level of CHI3L1 in
  myocardium assessed by RT-qPCR (n = 3/group). Abbreviations: S, sham control group;
  MI, myocardial infarction group; ME, post-MI exercise trained group. Symbol * indicates
  p < 0.05 and ** indicates p < 0.01 between the relevant groups that are compared.'
