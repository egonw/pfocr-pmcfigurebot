caption: Molecular classification of Taiwanese HCC patients using a panel of 18 Hippo
  pathway genes. (A) Heatmap showing normalized expression levels of the 18 signature
  genes (rows) across subjects (columns) divided into two molecular subclasses (A,B)
  using an unsupervised approach. Each signature gene was significantly up- or downregulated
  compared with the other subclasses, as indicated by color changes, where blue and
  red indicates low and high expression, respectively. Signature genes and subjects
  were hierarchically clustered within each class. Significant differences in demographic
  characteristics, clinical annotations, molecular subclasses, and hepatitis B and
  C virus infection status across subjects are shown at the top of the figure. (B)
  Overall survival of subjects in each molecular subclass.
