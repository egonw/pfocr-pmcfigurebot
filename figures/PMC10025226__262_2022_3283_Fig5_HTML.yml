caption: Proposed metabolic rewiring (with lipid consumption instead of only glutamine
  and glucose feeding). This is the first clinical evidence that this metabolic adaptation
  is used by colorectal cancer cells, after avelumab and ADC therapy, to boost oxidative
  stress and contribute to cancer progression. Oxidative stress is compensated in
  IMMETCOLS cluster 3 tumors with anti-oxidative pathways such as pentose-phosphate
  pathway
article_title: A Phase I-II multicenter trial with Avelumab plus autologous dendritic
  cell vaccine in pre-treated mismatch repair-proficient (MSS) metastatic colorectal
  cancer patients; GEMCAD 1602 study.
