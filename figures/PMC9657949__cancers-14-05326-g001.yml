caption: Graphical summary of HER2-related pathway regulation by miRNAs involved in
  tumor formation, progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance. Aberrantly activated
  signaling pathways can lead to differently expressed miRNAs, causing the deregulation
  of their target mRNAs. For instance, miR-221/222 are activated downstream of HER2
  and are able to directly target ER. HER2-activated FOXO3 also regulates the IGFR1
  pathway by inducing the expression of miR-193-5p, miR-30-5p, and miR-128-3p. Vice
  versa, miRNAs can also regulate members of the HER family themselves, such as HER3,
  which is directly targeted by miR-205. This figure was created with BioRender.com.
