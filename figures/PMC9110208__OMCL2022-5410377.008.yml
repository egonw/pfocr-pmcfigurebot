caption: OG dependently regulates Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway and autophagy in osteoclast
  derived from RAW264.7 cells. (a) Representative Western blot images and the quantification
  of Nrf2 and Keap1 expression in osteoclast with the treatment of OG or RAP incubation
  for 48 h. (b) Representative Western blot images and the quantification of p-mTOR,
  mTOR, p-p70S6K, p70S6K, LC3II, Beclin1, and p62 expression in the osteoclast with
  the treatment of OG or ML385 incubation for 48 h. Each point represents mean ± SD
  (n = 3). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. the indicated group.
