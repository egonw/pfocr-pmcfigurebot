caption: 'Methylprednisolone inhibits key inflammatory and viral signaling pathways
  in host lung and airway cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Heatmap depicts the effects
  of Methylprednisolone in silico in SARS-CoV-2 infection on select signaling pathways
  of interest as recently identified to be of importance by A) Catanzaro et al. 2020
  and B) Draghici et al. 2020. From left to right for each cell-line depicted, column
  A: pathway analysis results of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro as performed using
  the MITHrIL algorithm; column B: PHENSIM results of SARS-CoV-2 infection in silico;
  column C: PHENSIM simulation results of Methylprednisolone on SARS-CoV-2 infected
  cells in silico. Color gradient depicts the average pathway perturbation as predicted
  in our PHENSIM in silico experiments for column B&C. NHBE; Normal Human Bronchial
  Epithelial cells, Calu-3; Cultured human airway epithelial cells, A549; Transformed
  lung alveolar cells, ACE2; angiotensin-converting enzyme, MOI; multiplicity of infection.'
