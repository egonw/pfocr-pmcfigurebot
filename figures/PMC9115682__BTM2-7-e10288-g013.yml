caption: Overview of the mechanisms of SCFA‐mediated immune modulation. SCFAs are
  produced by anaerobic metabolism of dietary fiber in the gut by bacteria. These
  two‐carbon (acetate), three‐carbon (propionate), and four‐carbon (butyrate) metabolic
  products influence the immune system by two modes of action, GPCR activation and
  HDAC inhibition. SCFAs modulate the innate immune system by activating GPR41, GPR43,
  and GPR109a, which are expressed on cells such as monocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages.
  SCFAs modulate the adaptive immune system by inhibiting HDAC, leading to modulation
  of the mTOR pathway, subsequently modifying the ratio of effector to regulatory
  T cells. The figure was created with BioRender.com. GPCR, G‐protein‐coupled cell
  membrane receptor; HDAC, histone deacetylase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin;
  SCFA, short‐chain fatty acids
