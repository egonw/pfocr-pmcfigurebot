caption: 'GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses of upregulated and downregulated
  genes in the two groups based on the median S100A7 expression in breast cancer.
  (A) GO functional enrichment analysis of upregulated genes based on the S100A7 median
  expression grouping. (B) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of upregulated genes based
  on the S100A7 median expression grouping. (C) GO functional enrichment analysis
  of downregulated genes based on the S100A7 median expression grouping. (D) KEGG
  pathway enrichment analysis of downregulated genes based on the S100A7 median expression
  grouping. (E) PPI network of the DEGs between S100A7-high and -low expression groups
  pan-cancer. Abbreviations: GO: Gene Ontology; KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
  and Genomes; PPI: proteinâ€“protein interaction.'

  tumor stemness and tumor heterogeneity in pan-cancer and its role in chemotherapy
  resistance in breast cancer.
