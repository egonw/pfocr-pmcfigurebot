caption: Plasmid-based inducible expression of an MCFA biosynthetic pathway and the
  analysis of MCFAs produced by the engineered strain CLPY03. (A). Schematic of the
  recombinant plasmid pESC-HR harboring the MCFA biosynthetic pathway under the control
  of galactose-inducible promoters (PGAL1 and PGAL10). (B). Organization of mhFAS-rTE
  domains. (C). Schematic of the MCFA biosynthetic pathway. (D). Measurement of the
  intracellular MCFAs. (E). The time-course production level of MCFAs secreted into
  the medium. The data was obtained from at least three independent experiments. *,
  p < 0.05, **, p < 0.01 (Student’s t-test). hSFP, human phosphopantetheinyl transferase
  gene (encoding NP_056238.2), mhFAS-rTEII, a human fatty acid synthase mutant gene
  (mhFAS, encoding aa1-2,218 of NP_004095.4) fused with a rat thioesterase gene (rTEII,
  encoding NP_073196.1). KS, β-ketoacyl synthase, MAT, Malonyl-CoA-/acetyl-CoA-ACP-transacylase,
  DH, Dehydratase, ER, β-enyl reductase, KR, β-ketoacyl reductase, ACP, Acyl carrier
  protein.
