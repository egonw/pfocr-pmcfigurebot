caption: Pectin degradation. (A) The pathway to pectin degradation to D-galacturonic
  acid. (B) Differentially expressed genes of young leaf compared with old leaf for
  genes annotated as pectin lyase-like superfamily protein, pectin methylesterase
  inhibitor superfamily, hydrolases and expansin. Differential transcript levels in
  a comparison between young and old leaves with red colour indicating higher levels
  of transcripts in young leaves and green indicating lower levels in young leaves
  compared to old leaves. (C) Gene expression levels expressed as TPM of genes for
  AT1G69530 (expansin A1, EXPA1), AT5G47500 (pectin lyase-like superfamily protein,
  PME5), AT3G49220 (plant invertase/pectin methylesterase inhibitor superfamily, PME34)
  and AT4G19420 (pectin acetylesterase family protein, PAE8) in young leaf and old
  leaf under control, 1 h and 10 h heat stress. All comparisons between young and
  old leaf were significantly (P = 0.01) different except three comparisons marked
  as ns for non-significant. (D) Analysis of genes potentially involved in pectin
  degradation following a STRING network analysis using a minimum required interaction
  score of 0.7, line thickness indicating the strength of data support. For colour,
  please refer to the online images.
