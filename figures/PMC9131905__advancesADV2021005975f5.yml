caption: The PPP is differentially regulated between E10.5 and E12.5 erythroid precursors.
  (A) Pathway map of the interplay between glycolysis and the PPP is shown. (B) Relative
  abundance of PPP enzymes between E10.5 and E12.5 populations. (C-D) Relative abundance
  of PPP metabolites (C) and reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione (D) in
  E10.5 and E12.5 populations. (E) Increased expression of hemoglobin (Hb) chains
  and band 3 (or solute carrier protein 4A1-SLC4A1). (F) These proteins are involved
  in the phenomenon of oxygen-dependent metabolic modulation, which regulates metabolic
  fluxes through glycolysis and the PPP as a function of Hb oxygenation status and
  competitive binding of deoxyhemoglobin and glycolytic enzymes for the N-terminus
  cytosolic domain of SLC4A1 band 3. (G-I) Switch-tag proteomic approach (G) revealed
  differing cysteine oxidation status (H) in the 2 cell populations; these differences
  were accompanied by altered expression levels of many redox enzymes (I), including
  CAT, superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) and GPX4, glutathione
  reductase (GSR), and peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1), PRDX2, and PRDX6. Metabolites are
  graphed as violin plots and proteins as box-whisker plots. (J-K) Levels of ROS in
  E10.5 or E12.5 cells endogenously after collection (J) or after exogenous challenge
  (K) with 3, 10, or 30 Î¼M H2O2. *P < .05, **P < .01, ***P < .001, ****P < .0001.
