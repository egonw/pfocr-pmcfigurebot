caption: 'WKYMVm inhibited the ERK1/2 and NF-κB p65 signaling pathways and affected
  the p38 signaling pathway in microglial cells. (a–c) Western blot analyses and quantitative
  data. The impact of FPR2 activation by WKYMVm on phosphorylation of p38, ERK1/2,
  NF-κB p65, and IκBα protein level in LPS-treated HAPI microglia with or without
  pretreatment of WKYMVm. (d–f) Western blot analyses and quantitative data for p-p38,
  p-ERK1/2, p-NF-κB p65, and IκBα from each group in primary microglia. SB203580:
  p38-specific inhibitor; U0126: ERK-specific inhibitor; BAY11-7082: NF-κB p65-specific
  inhibitor. ∗p < 0.05 vs. the control group; #p < 0.05 vs. the LPS group.'
