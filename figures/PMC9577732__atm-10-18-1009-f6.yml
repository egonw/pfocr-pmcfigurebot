caption: Animal experiments showed Amentoflavone exhibits antitumor effects in the
  PDX model. (A,B) PDX1 and 2 treated with amentoflavone (50 mg/kg body weight) or
  vehicle (control group) for 45 days (n=5 for each group). The xenograft growth was
  monitored. (C,D) qPCR validation of miR-16 and mRNA of HMGA2 expression from the
  tumors of PDX-1 and -2. (E,F) qPCR validation of HMGA2 and β-catenin protein expression
  from the tumors of PDX-1 and -2. (A-D) N = 3, mean ± SEM, *P<0.05, by Student’s
  t-test. Data represents similar results from 3 independent experiments. PDX, patient-derived
  xenograft; qPCR, quantitative polymerase chain reaction; SEM, structural equation
  modeling.
