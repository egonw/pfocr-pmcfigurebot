caption: 'Effects of dietary FAs on TLR4/NF-κB signals and NLRP3 inflammasome as well
  as its downstream signals in articular cartilage of mice. (a) The relative expression
  of TLR4, MyD88, and p-NF-κB protein of knee articular cartilage was detected by
  Western blot. (b–d) Immunohistochemical staining was used to measure NLRP3, caspase-1,
  and IL-1β positive cells (200x, scale bars = 100 μm). The data are presented as
  the means ± SD, n = 5. ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01 versus the LD group; #p < 0.05 and
  ##p < 0.01 versus the sham group; ^p < 0.05 and ^^p < 0.01 versus the SFA group;
  &p < 0.05 and &&p < 0.01 versus the MUFA group; $p < 0.05 and $$p < 0.01 versus
  the n-6 group.'
