caption: Synergistic sensitization of p21-knockout cells in response to NSC49L and
  TRAIL treatmentHCT116-p21+/+ and HCT116-p21−/− cells were treated with different
  concentrations of NSC49L and TRAIL either alone or in combination for 72 h and the
  cell survival was determined by the MTT-assay.(A and B) The IC50 of TRAIL and NSC49L
  cells, respectively. The IC50 is derived from the survival curves.(C) The synergistic
  effect of NSC49L and TRAIL with HCT116-p21−/− cells. Data are the mean ± SE of four
  estimations. The p-value is shown on the top of each graph.
