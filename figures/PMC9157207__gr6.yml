caption: 'HRP2 increases pro-inflammatory and Toll-like receptor (TLR) genes in cortical
  organoids. HRP2-induced inflammation-related genes were profiledFold changes greater
  than 1.5 and p values < 0.05 calculated using Student’s t-test was considered to
  be a significant dysregulation. (A) A heatmap was generated showing up-and down-regulated
  genes. The effects of HRP2 on cortical organoids at day 50 in culture are shown
  by site (B), including cerebral cortex and glia, as well as by pathway (C), including
  TLR signaling. Further analysis revealed the relationship between upregulated genes
  and activation of TLR2 pathway (D). Western blot densitometry of organoid lysates
  (data represented as means ± SEM) confirms that HRP2 significantly induces TLR2
  and TLR1 expression, whereas NRG1 reduces these effects (E, F). a: p < 0.05 compared
  to basal conditions; b: p < 0.05 compared to HRP2 treatment. One-way ANOVA and t-test
  were used. Please also see .'
