caption: Overview of the NR-AhR signaling pathway. AhR is an inactive cytosolic transcription
  factor bound to several co-chaperones. When a ligand passively diffuses through
  the cell membrane and binds to AhR, the ligand-receptor complex translocates into
  the nucleus, and the chaperones dissociate. Once in the nucleus, the AhR dimerizes
  with the AhR nuclear translocator (ARNT) forming an active heterodimer. The activated
  heterodimer complex interacts with DNA directly or indirectly by binding to recognition
  sequences located in the promoter regions of target genes, such as the xenobiotic
  response elements (XRE). BRCA1 modulates the expression of genes involved in xenobiotic
  stress responses [], and was selected by our pipeline as an important protein feature
  in AhR toxicity. The binding of the heterodimer complex to the DNA activates the
  transcription of genes leading to proteins that affect inflammation, the cell cycle,
  and immunological response. The toxicity of the ligand-activated AhR can also be
  mediated by non-genomic action through enzymatic activation and the triggering of
  other pathways, such as the NF-B pathway, which involves the TRAF6 protein, another
  important protein selected by our pipeline. The interconnection of different pathways
  as shown exemplifies how our pipeline can decipher different mechanisms for AhR
  toxicity induced by the toxic compounds.
