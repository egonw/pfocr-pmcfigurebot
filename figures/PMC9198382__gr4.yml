caption: 'FGFR structure, signaling, and its alterations in cancer. FGFR is a transmembrane
  receptor tyrosine kinase, activating downstream signaling through three different
  pathways: via intracellular receptor substrates STAT, FRS2, and phospholipase C-γ1
  (PLC-γ), leading ultimately to up-regulation of the RAS-dependent MAPK and Ras-independent
  PI3K-Akt signaling pathways (Adapted from Brooks et al., 2012).Trk receptors, ALK
  and ROS fusions; signaling pathway. TrkA, B, and C upon neurotrophin binding, activate
  downstream signaling cascades of the MAPK, PI3K, and PLC-γ pathways. ALK and ROS
  fusions, through the activation of the intracellular substrate SHP2, activate the
  same pathways mentioned before; PLC-γ, MAPK, PI3K, and the STAT pathway through
  the activation of JAK (Adapted from Kheder and Hong, 2018, Della Corte et al., 2018,
  and Davies and Doebele, 2013). HER2 receptor: signaling pathway and alterations.
  The HER2 has tyrosine activity similar to EGFR. The HER2 activation leads to tumorigenesis
  through the activation of MAPK and PI3K pathways, increasing proliferation, cell
  cycle progression through the activation of cyclin D, and inhibition of p27, and
  ultimately leading to cell survival (Adapted from Pollock and Grandis, 2015 and
  LV et al., 2016).AKT, protein kinase B; ALK,anaplastic lymphoma kinase; BRAF, v-raf
