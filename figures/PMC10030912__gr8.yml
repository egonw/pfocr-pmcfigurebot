caption: SOX4 mediates crosstalk between the BMP4 and TGFβ signaling pathways and
  activates the Wnt signaling pathway in vivo(A) iWATs were isolated from WT and Pref1-Sox4
  mice fed HFD for 20 weeks, and the mesenchymal progenitor, pro-fibrosis, fibrogenic,
  preadipocyte, and pro-inflammation genes were examined and shown in the heatmap.
  The color scale shows Z scored log2FC representing the mRNA level of each gene in
  blue (low expression)-white-red (high expression) scheme.(B) mRNA levels of indicated
  genes were analyzed by qPCR in iWAT SVFs of WT and Pref1-Sox4 mice fed HFD for 20
  weeks (n = 4–5).(C) mRNA levels of lipogenic genes were analyzed by qPCR in mature
  white adipocytes from iWAT of WT and Pref1-Sox4 mice fed HFD for 20 weeks (n = 5).(D)
  PDGFRα+ cells were sorted from iWATs of WT and Pref1-Sox4 mice by FACS and then
  treated with 100 ng/mL BMP4 or 10 μM SB431542 as method described before harvest.
  The relative mRNA levels of indicated genes were assessed by qPCR (n = 4–6).(E–G)
  3-week-old WT mice and Pref1-Sox4 mice were fed with HFD for 20 weeks. SVFs were
  isolated and subjected to adipocyte differentiation. The mRNA levels of lipogenic
  genes and fibrogenesis genes were analyzed by qPCR (E). The lipid accumulation and
  fibrogenesis were analyzed by Oil Red O staining (F) and Sirius Red staining (G),
  respectively. Scale bar, 200 μm.Data are represented as mean ± SD. ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p
  < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.
