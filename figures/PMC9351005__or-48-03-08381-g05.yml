caption: PI3K/Akt signaling pathway modulates the expansion of LCSCs. (A) SC-79 increased
  the mRNA expression of stemness-associated genes in HepG2 cells. (B) LY294002 decreased
  the mRNA expression of stemness-associated genes in HCCLM3 cells. (C and D) Effects
  of SC-79 on the expression levels of stemness-associated genes in HepG2 cells. The
  proteins were normalized with β-actin. (E and F) Effects of LY294002 on the expression
  levels of stemness-associated genes in HCCLM3 cells. The proteins were normalized
  with β-actin. (G and H) Effects of SC-79 on the sphere-forming capacities of HepG2
  cells. Magnification, ×200. The bar graph shows the average number of spheres >100
  µm in diameter. (I and J) Effects of LY294002 on the sphere-forming capacities of
  HCCLM3 cells. Magnification, ×200. The bar graph shows the average number of spheres
  >100 µm in diameter. All error bars represent the means ± SEM of three independent
  experiments; *P<0.05 vs. the control group. PI3K/Akt, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein
  kinase B; LCSCs, liver cancer stem cells; EpCAM, epithelial cell adhesion molecule;
  p-, phosphorylated.
