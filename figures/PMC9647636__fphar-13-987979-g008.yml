caption: 'Signaling through TBK1/IKKε and IFNAR promotes kidney injury in LPS-induced
  nephropathy. (A–G) Functional relevance of TBK1/IKKε and IFNAR in the LPS nephropathy
  (LPSN) model. (A) Study design. Mice were pretreated with amlexanox (AMX) or anti-IFNAR
  neutralizing antibody (IFNAR-Ab) before LPS administration. (B–D) Impact of IFNAR
  blockade in LPSN. (B) qRT-PCR of kidney ISGs and cytokines (Ifit1, Usp18, Oasl2,
  Cxcl10). (C) Kidney infiltration by F4/80 + mononuclear phagocytes. (D) TUNEL+ dead
  cells. Mean ± SEM. *p ≤ 0.05 vs control; #p ≤ 0.05 vs LPS (n = 4). Original magnification
  ×200. Scale bar 100 µm. (E–G) Impact of TBK1/IKKε targeting by amlexanox (AMX) in
  LPSN. Amlexanox (AMX) decreased plasma urea levels (E) (Mean ± SEM. *p ≤ 0.05 vs
  control; #p ≤ 0.05 vs LPS; n = 5,6 mice per group); infiltration by F4/80 + mononuclear
  phagocytes (F), and the number of TUNEL+ dead cells (G) in kidneys from mice with
  LPSN. Representative images and quantification. Mean ± SEM. *p ≤ 0.05 vs control;
  #p ≤ 0.05 vs LPS (n = 4 per group). Original magnification ×200. Scale bar 100 µm.'
