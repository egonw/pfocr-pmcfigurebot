caption: Mitochondrial retrograde signaling pathway model(A) The mitochondria-to-nucleus
  communication circuit. Retrograde signaling is divided into the activation layer
  and modulation layer. Retrograde proteins (Bmhp, Mksp, and Rtg1/2/3p) are classified
  into an active (-act) and inactive state (-ina). Cellular compartments are divided
  based on the nucleus (-nuc) and cytosol (-cyt). The arrow represents the binding
  of two proteins, transformation of active states, or translocation between nucleus
  and cytosol, with the kinetic coefficient labeled besides it. The input s is defined
  as the summation of mitochondrial damage signals. Rtg2p is activated once the mitochondrion
  loses its membrane potential, or the ATP concentration decreases. The active form
  of Rtg2p suppresses the formation of the Mks/bmhp complex by competitive binding
  with Mksp, resulting in dephosphorylation of Rtg3p and translocates to the nucleus
  accompanied by Rtg1p. The Rtg1p-Rtg3p complex eventually triggers the retrograde
  response and upregulates CIT2 expression.(B) Step responses of Bmh/Mksp, Rtg1pn
  and Rtg3pn showing switch-like responses of Bmh/Mksp, capacity-charging curve with
  a time delay for Rtg1pn and delayed two-staged rise with a sharp transition at the
  beginning, for Rtg3pn.(C) The sinusoidal inputs of  Hz response reveals RTG signaling
  pathway as a low-pass filter. The mitochondrial damage signal (thin gray line),
  labeled as the input with quantity shown on the right y axis. The concentration
  of RTG proteins (thick blue line), regarded as outputs with quantities labeled on
  the left y axis. To normalize the response, the mass fraction is defined as the
  ratio of the concentration of a given protein set to its total concentration. Nucleus
  accumulation is described by the ratio of nucleus concentration to total protein
  concentration.
