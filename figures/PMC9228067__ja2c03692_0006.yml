caption: Full elucidated mechanism of the photoredox cycle (top) and cobalt cycle
  (bottom) with DFT energies (kcal molâ€“1) in gray for selected steps. Techniques used
  to probe various steps in the mechanism are indicated. Only the pathway from the
  Z isomer toward the major product (syn) is shown; a corresponding higher energy
  pathway exists for the E-allyl isomer.
