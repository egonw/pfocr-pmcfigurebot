caption: The relevant signaling pathways of FAM189B coexpressed genes in gastric cancer.
  (a) The interaction of MEM, COXPRESdb coexpressed genes, and differently expressed
  genes from TCGA/GTEx data of gastric cancer. Signaling pathways or gene annotations
  from KEGG (b), BP GO (c), CC GO (d), and MF GO (e). (f) PPI of the genes in the
  pathway of the cell cycle from KEGG.
