caption: Schematic representation of factors promoting NRF2-deficiency in patients
  with chronic kidney disease and mechanisms by which this may result in protein-energy
  wasting (PEW) and muscle wasting, by promoting oxidative stress/inflammation and
  activating the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) pathway
article_title: Transcription factor NRF2 as potential therapeutic target for preventing
  muscle wasting in aging chronic kidney disease patients.
