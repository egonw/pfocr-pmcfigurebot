caption: 'Effect of SRT1720 on the PQ-mediated KEAP1/NRF2 pathway. Cells pretreated
  with 1 μM SRT1720 (SRT) for 1 h were treated with or without 0.3 mM PQ. Cells were
  subjected to (A) Western blotting and (B) ICC. The intensities were divided by the
  internal control and normalized to the control group (100%). Data points represented
  the mean ± SD of three experiments. Cells transfecting with pNRF2-GFP and pUb-RFP
  (6:4) were pretreated with 1 μM SRT and 0.3 mM PQ for 24 h, and a confocal microscope
  acquired the images (C). Furthermore, after 1 μM SRT and 0.3 mM PQ treatment as
  described above, cells were subjected to (D) aggresome and (E) proteasome activity
  assay. The bar represents 5 μm in all imaging. The percentage of red punctated aggresome
  of at least 30 cells in every 5 fields was counted. The luminescence intensities
  in the arbitrary unit (AU) were calculated. Data points represent the mean ± SD
  of three experiments. Differences among groups were evaluated through one-way ANOVA
  with the Student-Newman-Keuls test and considered significant at p < 0.05. *p < 0.05,
  compared to the control group. #p < 0.05, compared to the PQ-treated group. Alternatively,
  after NRF2 silencing, cells were subjected to (F) dot blot, Western blot analysis,
  and (G) survival assay. The relative intensities of NRF2 were divided by the internal
  control and normalized to the siControl group (100%). Data points represent the
  mean ± SD of three experiments. Differences between groups were evaluated through
  t-testing and considered significant at p < 0.05. Cell viability was represented
  as a percentage of the neutral red assay results compared to controls. Differences
  between groups of raw data were evaluated through two-way ANOVA with the Student-Newman-Keuls
  test and considered significant at p < 0.05. *p < 0.05, compared to the control
  group. #p < 0.05, compared to the PQ-treated group. (For interpretation of the references
