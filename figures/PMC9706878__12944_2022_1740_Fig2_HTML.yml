caption: 'In vitro overexpression of circLDLR ameliorates the development of NAFLD
  by activating the autophagy signaling pathway. A ORO staining showed the lipid droplets
  in overexpressed circLDLR Hepa1-6 cells. B and C Hepa1-6 cells with or without OA/PA
  treatment to transfect with circLDLR overexpression plasmid, and an enzymatic method
  was used to measure intracellular TG and TC contents. *P < 0.05 vs. BSA group, #P < 0.05
  vs. vector group. D Hepa1-6 cells with overexpressed circLDLR were transfected with
  Ad-LC3-GFP-RFP adenovirus and then assessed by immunofluorescence using confocal
  microscopy. The number of RFP- and GFP-LC3 puncta per cell were quantified and the
  amount of dots was calculated in the minimum of three independent visual fields
  from three separate wells. *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001 vs. vector group; ##P < 0.01,
  ###P < 0.001 vs. circLDLR OE group; &&P < 0.01 vs. vector + PA/OA group. E LC3 and
  p62, and LAMP2 expressions in Hepa1-6 cells were determined using western blot and
  relative quantification. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 vs. vector group; ###P < 0.001
  vs. circLDLR OE group; &&P < 0.01, &&&P < 0.001 vs. vector + PA/OA group'
