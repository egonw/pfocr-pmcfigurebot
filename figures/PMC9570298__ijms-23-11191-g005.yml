caption: 'The association analysis of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq. (A) The pairwise comparisons
  of DEGs and differential ATAC-associated genes. The pathways marked with red boxes
  are used for further analysis in (D). (B) Functional enrichment of PEIGs compared
  with DEGs and DARs. Heatmap tagged with the number âˆ’log10 (FDR). (C) ATAC signaling
  distribution in the upstream promoter region of related transcription factors in
  PEIGs. (D) Annotation of significantly enriched pathway genes in PEIGs relative
  to DEGs and DARs, and water deprivation pathway related genes (marked by the red
  box in (B)). The involved pathways are marked with different colors: purple for
  phosphate-containing compound metabolic process, red for secondary metabolic process
  and phenylpropanoid metabolic process, yellow for response to organonitrogen compound,
  blue for response to ethylene, brown for substrate-specific transmembrane transporter
  activity, green for response to water deprivation, and black for multiple pathways.'
