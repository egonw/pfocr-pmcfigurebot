caption: ERα is associated with phenotype switching of VSMCs in vitro and in vivo.
  (A,B) Western blot analysis of SM-MHC, α-SMA, calponin, caldesmon, OPN, PCNA and
  ERα protein levels in rat cerebrovascular VSMCs under HU or control (A), and quantification
  of the protein levels compared to GAPDH (B). (C,D), Western blot analysis of SM-MHC,
  α-SMA, calponin, caldesmon, OPN, PCNA and ERα protein levels in A7r5 cells treated
  with FBS (C), and quantification of the protein levels compared to GAPDH (D). (E)
  The mRNA expression levels of Esr1 in rat cerebrovascular VSMCs under HU or control.
  (F) The mRNA expression levels of Myh11, Spp1, Esr1 in A7r5 cells treated with FBS
  for different hours. CON, control; HU, hindlimb unweighting; Values are the mean
  ± SEM (n = 6 mice or 3 independent cell isolations per group). *p < 0.05, **p <
  0.01 and ***p < 0.001 vs. control.
