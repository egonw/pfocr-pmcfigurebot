caption: 'The relationship between NOD2 and HDAC6 and the effect of MDP and HDAC6‐siRNA
  on NF‐κB signalling pathway and ferroptosis. (A–C) NOD2, HDAC6, P65, p‐P65 and IκBα
  protein levels in RAW264.7 cells were determined by Western blotting. (D) Quantitative
  real‐time PCR for NOD2 and HDAC6mRNA levels. (E–H) ROS, GSH, and Fe2+ levels in
  RAW264.7 cells detected by kits. The Western blotting experiment was repeated 3
  times and the other experiments were repeated 6 times. Compared with the normal
  group, #p < 0.05; compared with the H3 group, &p < 0.05. compared with the MDP group,
  ※p < 0.05.'
