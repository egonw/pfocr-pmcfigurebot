caption: 'HBV-related HCC proteomics data analysis results. (A) Differential expression
  analysis of tumor (T) versus para-cancer (P) is shown in volcano plots. Up-regulated
  genes (ratio > 2, P < 0.01) are shown in red and down-regulated genes (ratio < 0.5,
  P < 0.01) are shown in green. PYCR2 and ADH1A have the same expression trends in
  the original paper. (B) The enrichment analysis bar plots of T versus P using the
  gene sets related to ‘GO: Biological Process’. The upregulated gene sets are shown
  in orange and the downregulated gene sets are shown in grey. (C) The PPI network
  map of up-regulated genes of tumor. (D) The pathway map depicts up-regulated genes
  in p53 signaling pathway. (E) The heatmap generated in ClusterExp. Each row indicates
  a protein and each column indicates a tumor sample. (F) Survival analysis based
  on proteomics subtypes or the expressions of PYCR2 and ADH1A in tumor samples (N = 159).
  (G) The integration analysis of multi-omics data (proteomics data and transcriptomics
  data in this case). The gene-wise correlations are plotted in a histogram (up).
  The genes in the user-selected terms are plotted at the bottom. Red color and green
  color in the figure indicate positive and negative correlations, respectively. The
  scatter plot shows the correlation between two genes selected by users.'
