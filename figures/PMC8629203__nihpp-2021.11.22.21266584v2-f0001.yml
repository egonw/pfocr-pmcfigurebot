caption: 'A three-variant deterministic dynamic compartmental model with vaccination
  describes SARS-CoV-2 transmission in England. We model seven NHS England regions
  separately, with each divided into 16 five-year age groups: 0–4 years up to 70–74
  years, and 75 years and older. The model incorporates COVID-19 vaccination with
  two vaccine products (corresponding to the viral-vector (Va) and mRNA-based (Vb)
  vaccines in use in England), each with first- (Va1, Vb1) and second-dose (Va2, Vb2)
  protection, and each with lower levels of protection for individuals who received
  their primary vaccinations but no booster vaccine and have waned (Va2w, Vb2w). All
  vaccinated individuals have increased protection against different SARS-CoV-2 outcomes
  compared to susceptible individuals, according to the vaccine product administered
  and their vaccine dose/waned status (). Vaccinated individuals transition from the
  susceptible (S) compartment into first-dose vaccinated compartments (Va1, Vb1) depending
  on which vaccine product was received. Following an assumed first-dose duration
  (), individuals move into second-dose compartments (Va2, Vb2). Following an assumed
  second-dose duration (), individuals either receive a booster vaccine or transition
  into waned states (Va2w/Vb2w). We assume that individuals receiving primary courses
  of a viral-vector vaccine (Va2) or an mRNA vaccine (Vb2) both move to the Vb2 compartment
  following their booster vaccination, with their second-dose duration beginning again
  from zero (). This assumptions reflects the fact that all booster vaccinations in
  England are either the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccines, and evidence finding
  higher immunogenicity for individuals receiving Pfizer/BioNTech following Oxford-AstraZeneca,
  compared with individuals receiving both Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine doses. We model
  an additional temporary increase in vaccine protection for individuals receiving
  their first booster vaccine in late 2021/early 2022, which lasts for 180 days. We
  utilise three separate SARS-CoV-2 variants in the model to capture the introduction
  and spread of the Alpha, Delta and Omicron variants of concern in England. The model
  assumes a traditional infection process: upon being infected, individuals leave
  the susceptible (S), vaccinated (V) or recovered (R) states and move through exposed
  (E), infectious (I) and recovered (R) states. The latent (L) state is used in addition
  to the exposed (E) state for breakthrough infections following vaccination and for
  re- and cross-infections, to achieve additional vaccine protection against disease
  (, ). When individuals are infectious (I), they either progress through a subclinical
  (Is) pathway or a clinical pathway with pre-clinical (Ip) and clinical (Ic) states.
  Once individuals have been infected and recover (R), we allow for loss of immunity
  (where individuals return to a susceptible (S) state) and re- and cross-infections
  (where individuals with immunity become infected, see ). On the left hand side (yellow
  shaded background labelled I), solid black arrows represent primary vaccinations,
  solid coloured arrows represent booster vaccinations, and dotted black arrows represent
  loss of immunity. Coloured dash-dotted arrows denote susceptible and vaccinated
  individuals becoming infected and moving into the SARS-CoV-2 infection process (grey
  boxes on red shaded background labelled II). Here, solid black arrows denote individuals
  moving through the infection process and recovering (R) (purple boxes on purple
  shaded background labelled III). Recovered individuals can lose their immunity (dotted
  black arrows) and return to the susceptible disease state (S) () or be re- or cross-infected
  (dashed grey arrows) with other SARS-CoV-2 variants ().'
