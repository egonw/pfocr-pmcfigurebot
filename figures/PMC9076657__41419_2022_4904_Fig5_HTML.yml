caption: A The heatmap shows the relative strength of the outgoing signaling pathway
  (left) and the incoming signaling pathway (right) across 16 cell types. The color
  represents the relative signaling strength. The top colored bar plot shows the total
  signaling strength of a cell-type by summarizing all signaling pathways displayed
  in the heatmap. The right gray bar plot shows the total signaling strength of a
  signaling pathway by summarizing all cell types displayed in the heatmap. B This
  chord diagram shows specific connections between TAMs ligands and other cell types
  receptors. The color represents different cell types, and the thickness of the line
  represents the strength of the connection. C This chord diagram shows TAMs-mediated
  signaling pathway networks, including GRN, MIF, SPP1, PSAP, CCL, and GALECTIN signaling
  networks. D Violin plot shows the expression of the GRN, MIF, SPP1 and PSAP signaling
  pathway related ligands and receptors in 16 cell types. E Violin plot shows the
  expression of the CCL and GALECTIN signaling pathways related genes across 16 cell
  types. F Violin plot shows the expression of the CCL and GALECTIN signaling pathways
  related genes in the invasive and non-invasive groups. G Expression of the CD68
  (TAM marker gene), GALECTIN signal related ligand LGALS9 and receptor PTPRC (CD45)
  in FFPE sections of invasive and non-invasive RB samples (original magnification,
  Ã—50).
