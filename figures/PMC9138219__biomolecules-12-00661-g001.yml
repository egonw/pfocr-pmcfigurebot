caption: 'Effects of HBOT on TH-positive neurons in the SNpc of MPTP-treated mice.
  C57BL/6 mice were injected with MPTP (20 mg/kg, i.p.) four times at 2 h intervals
  for one day to induce PD model. One day after MPTP treatment, MPTP+HBOT group of
  mice were exposed to hyperbaric oxygen at 2.5 ATA with 100% oxygen for 1 h once
  daily for 7 consecutive days. (A) Representative photographs and (B) quantification
  of TH-positive neurons in SNpc. (C) Protein expression of TH in the mid-brain of
  MPTP-treated mice was detected by Western blotting. All data are expressed as mean
  ± SEM. (n = 5). # p < 0.05 and ## p < 0.01 compared with the control group; * p
  < 0.05 compared with the MPTP group.'
