figure_title: 'Responses of BR pathway mutants to water stress in the dark: violin
  plots, response quotients and volcano plots'
caption: '(A-C) Violin plots of the hypocotyl (A), root (B) and ratio responses (C)
  of the triple bin2-3bil1bil2 knock out line shown in , with the wild-type ecotype
  (Ws-2) as reference. The dot represents the mean and the line the 95% confidence
  interval. Note the high variance of the wild-type root response under darkW. bin2-3bil1bil2
  mutants qualified as decision mutants on 3 counts: (i) failure to adjust the hypocotyl/root
  ratio to darkW (the ratio for darkW is the same as for dark in panel C), (ii) low
  or non-significant P-value (see panel f below) and (iii) one organ (here the hypocotyl
  in panel a) exceeded wild-type length under darkW. (D) Color coding of steps in
  the BR signalling pathway; 1: biosynthesis, 2: perception, 3: signalling, 4: transcription.
  See text for further detail. (E) RQratioresponse quotient of the hypocotyl/root
  ratios under dark/darkW conditions, normalized to the wild-type ratio quotient;
  a value of 1 (vertical red line) indicates that the response to a shift from dark
  to darkW is similar to that of the respective wild-type ecotype. Each replicate
  is represented by a dot; purple dots are for initial and grey dots for optimized
  screen conditions; blue dots are for data from SEM measurements. Note that the triple
  bin2bil1bil2 knock out has the strongest phenotype, followed by bri1-116 bzr1-1D
  and bin2-1. (F) Volcano plot with the mean RQratio depicted in (E) on the X-axis
  and the median P-Value of the response on the Y-axis (negative log scale; a median
  of all replicates was used). Mutants in the lower left quadrant are considered to
  have a “confused decision phenotype” (see text). Only bin2 alleles (magenta arrows)
  or bypass mutants map to this quadrant. The area shaded in grey on the red line
  (green arrow) is where wild-type ecotypes would theoretically map onto the plot.
  Mutant alleles and their ecotypes are described in . Null alleles are depicted in
  regular font, semi-dominant or dominant in bold and higher order mutants are underlined.
