caption: Determining effects of CXCR4 knockdown on diminishing the cancer (EOC) proliferation
  capacity. CXCR4 expression in CXCR4-kD#1/OVCA420 (CXCR4 shRNA#1), CXCR4-kD#2/OVCA420
  (CXCR4 shRNA#2) (A, B) and CXCR4/SKOV3 (CXCR4 cDNA) (F, G) cells were analysed by
  Western blotting (WB) and qRT-PCR, respectively. The cancer (EOC) proliferation
  capacity was determined by colony formation assay (C, H) with percentage of colony
  formation (D, I) in both OVCA420 and SKOV3 stable cell lines modified by CXCR4 knockdown
  or overexpression, respectively. The MTT assay was used to measure the proliferation
  of the CXCR4-shRNA knockdown OVCA420 (E) and CXCR4-overexpressed SKOV3 (J), respectively.
  Absorbance was measured at 490 nm using the average from triplicate wells. Data
  are presented as the mean Â± SD of three independent experiments. Asterisk indicates
  P<0.05 compared with the controls as determined by t test.
