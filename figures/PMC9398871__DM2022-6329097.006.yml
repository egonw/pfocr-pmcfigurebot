caption: circCNN2 activates MAPK signaling pathway by upregulating ASK1 expression
  via E2F1. (a) RT-qPCR and western blot assays were conducted to examine the expression
  and protein levels of ASK1 in LUSC cells. (b, c) RT-qPCR and western blot analysis
  were used to examine the expression and protein levels of ASK1 after E2F1 was knocked
  down in H1703 and H226 cells. (d, e) ChIP and DNA pull down assay were carried out
  to verify the binding ability between E2F1 and ASK1 promoter. (f) Luciferase reporter
  assay was conducted to detect the specific binding site between E2F1 and ASK1 promoter.
  (g) Western blot was conducted to detect the protein levels of p38 and p-p38 upon
  E2F1 silencing. (h) RT-qPCR was used to examine the expression of ASK1 in different
  transfection groups. (i) Western blot assay was conducted to examine the protein
  levels of p38, p-p38, and ASK1 under different transfection conditions. ∗∗P < 0.01
  compared to the control group.
