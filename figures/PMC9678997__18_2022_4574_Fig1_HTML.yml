caption: 'LRRK2 G2019S mutation deregulates the TH–DA pathway, leading to DA neuron
  vulnerability. A–G LRRK2 enhances TH expression in PC12 cells in an LRRK2 kinase
  activity-dependent manner. A, C and F Representative Western blot data of up-regulated
  TH levels in PC12 cells under transient overexpression of WT, mutant G2019S or 3KD
  LRRK2. A FL LRRK2, C LRRK2 RCK domains and F LRRK2 kinase domain. B, D and G, Densitometric
  analysis of TH protein bands of Western blot gels in A, C and F, respectively. *,
  at least P < 0.01, compared with arbitrary value of TH protein bands of GFP-transfected
  control cells. E Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis of TH expression in PC12
  cells under overexpression of WT, mutant G2019S or 3KD LRRK2 RCK domains. *P < 0.01,
  compared with relative TH expression level of GFP-transfected control cells. H Expression
  of WT and mutant G2019S LRRK2 RCK domains impair PC12 cell viability, which can
  be partially rescued by 500 µM GSH treatment. *, at least P < 0.01, compared with
  cell viability of the respective WT or G2019S RCK domains transfected PC12 cells
  in the absence of GSH treatment. (I–P) Stable transfection of LRRK2 up-regulates
  TH and DA levels, sensitizing human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells to stress challenges.
  I Representative Western blot TH protein bands in SH-SY5Y cells stably transfected
  with empty vector, WT or mutant G2019S FL LRRK2. J Densitometric analysis of Western
  blot TH protein bands in I. *P < 0.001, compared with arbitrary value of TH bands
  of empty vector transfected control SH-SY5Y cells. K and L Mutant G2019S LRRK2-induced
  DA content increase in stably transfected SH-SY5Y cells can be abrogated by treatment
  with 2 mM α-MT, a specific TH inhibitor. K Quantitative analysis of DA content by
  HPLC, *, at least P < 0.05, compared with DA content of the respective cells in
  the absence of α-MT. L Representative HPLC chromatography of DA peaks. M Quantitative
  real-time RT-PCR analysis of TH and LRRK2 expression level in stably transfected
  SH-SY5Y cells. *, at least P < 0.01, compared with TH and LRRK2 expression levels
  of empty vector transfected SH-SY5Y cells. N Stable transfection of mutant G2019S
  LRRK2 sensitizes SH-SY5Y cells to H2O2 challenge. *, at least P < 0.05, compared
  with cell viability of empty vector transfected SH-SY5Y cells treated with the respective
  dosage of H2O2. (O and P) 2 mM α-MT treatment alleviates LRRK2-induced SH-SY5Y cell
  viability impairment under 100 µM Fe2+ (O) or 100 µM Fe3+ (P) challenges. *, at
  least P < 0.05, compared with cell death rate of the respective stable cells without
  iron species challenges. #, at least P < 0.05, compared with cell death rate of
  respective SH-SY5Y cells under the respective iron species challenges'
