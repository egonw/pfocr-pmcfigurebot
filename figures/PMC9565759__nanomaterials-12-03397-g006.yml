caption: Scheme of the signaling network through which a picosecond pulsed electric
  field (psPEF) induces apoptosis in HeLa cells, as proposed by Chen et al. The pulses
  disturb the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function, resulting in the release of Ca2+
  and the depolarization of mitochondria, which in turn release cytochrome C (cyt
  c) and activate the caspase family. The ER dysfunction also causes two of its transmembrane
  proteins, activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and protein kinase-like ER kinase
  (PERK), to activate the unfolded protein response. The ATF6 pathway promotes the
  expression of ER chaperones and the pro-apoptotic transcription factor CCAAT enhancer-binding
  protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP). Phospho-PERK instead phosphorylates eukaryotic
  initiation factor-2α (eIF2α), which decreases gene expression. Reprinted from []
