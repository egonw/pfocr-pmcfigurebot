caption: Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice were transplanted with bone marrow from Vav1Cre+/−
  (Control) or Dnmt3afl/flVav1Cre+/− (H-DNMT3A-KO) mice and, after 4 weeks, injected
  with PBS or dexamethasone (DEX). After 4h, the thymus was harvested and immunostained
  with anti-annexin V to document the initial increase in apoptosis after PBS or DEX
  injection, n=4 mice per group (a). For b (left), thymi were immunostained with Mac2
  (green) and DNMT3A (Red). White arrows indicate non-macrophage DNMT3A, and brown
  arrows indicate macrophage DNMT3A. For b (right), documentation of co-localized
  p-ERK1/2, COX2, and Mac2. Representative image from n=4 mice per group. Scale bar,
  50 μm. c-d, Wildtype (WT) C57BL/6J mice transplanted with bone marrow from control
  or H-DNMT3A-KO mice were injected i.p. with 1 mg/mL Zymosan A1. After 12 h, peritoneal
  exudate cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for F4/80+ and COX2+ cells (n=4 mice/group)
  LAP-TGFβ1+ cells (n= 4 mice/group). e-m, Ldlr−/− (LDLR-KO) mice were transplanted
  with bone marrow from control or H-DNMT3A-KO mice and, after 4 weeks, fed a western-type
  diet (WD) for 12 weeks. Aortic root sections were immunostained for Mac2 and DNMT3A.
  Brown arrows indicate macrophage DNMT3A. Representative image from n=8 mice per
  group (e); body weight, n=10 mice/group (f); and the plasma or blood was assayed
  for the indicated metabolic and immune cell parameters, n=10 mice/group (g-l) and
  the lipoprotein-cholesterol profile by FPLC (m). Scale bar, 50 μm. Values are means
  ± SEM; n.s., not significant (P > 0.05). Two-sided P values were determined by the
  Student’s t-test for two groups or one-way ANOVA with Fisher’s LSD posthoc analysis
  for three or more groups.
