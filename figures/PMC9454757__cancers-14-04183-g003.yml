caption: 'CeRNA network and GO analyses of shared circRNAs. (A) CeRNA network among
  hsa_circ_0043138, circRNA-0044301, hsa_circ_0041481, and hsa_circ_0025135 and their
  targeted miRNAs and genes (nodes: red nodes are microRNAs; light-blue nodes are
  protein-coding RNAs; light-green nodes are noncoding RNAs; brown nodes are circular
  RNAs; edges: edges with a T-shaped arrow represent direct relationships; edges without
  an arrow represent indirect relationships (ceRNA relationship)). (B) Biological
  processes of the four circRNAs. (C) Cellular components of the four circRNAs. (D)
  Molecular functions of the four circRNAs (“GO. ID” stands for the ID of the GO term;
  “Count” stands for the number of DE genes associated with the listed GOID; “p value”
  stands for the significance testing value of the GOID; “Enrichment Score” stands
  for the enrichment score value of the GOID, which equals (−log10(p value)).'
