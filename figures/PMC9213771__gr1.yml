caption: 'Assay system for monitoring S1P cellular uptake and recycling into the sphingolipid
  synthesis pathway. A: Schematic of experimental design. Top, WT HeLa cells express
  Shiga toxin receptor, Gb3, on their cell surface regardless of exogenous supplementation
  with S1P. Middle, SPTLC1 KO HeLa cells express low levels of cell-surface Gb3. Bottom,
  supplementation with exogenous S1P restores Gb3 cell-surface expression in SPTLC1
  KO HeLa cells to WT levels. B: Flow cytometry analysis of Gb3 cell-surface expression
  in WT HeLa and SPTLC1 KO HeLa cells. Top row, representative dot plots of Gb3 cell-surface
  expression in WT HeLa cells without S1P treatment and after 16 h of 2 μM S1P treatment.
  Bottom row, representative dot plots of Gb3 cell-surface expression in SPTLC1 KO
  HeLa cells without S1P treatment and after 16 h of 2 μM S1P treatment. C: Bar graph
  represents quantification of Gb3 cell-surface expression in WT HeLa and SPTLC1 KO
  HeLa cells determined by flow cytometry. Data represent the mean ± SD (n = 3). P
  values were determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons
  test; ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001. D: Representative Western blot of SPTLC1 protein expression
  in WT HeLa and SPTLC1 KO HeLa cells. β-actin was used as a loading control. Bar
  graph presents quantification of relative SPTLC1 protein expression normalized to
  β-actin. SPTLC1 protein expression in WT HeLa cells is shown as 1.0. Gb3, globotriaosylceramide;
  PM, plasma membrane; S1P, sphingosine-1-phosphate.'
