caption: Epithelial cell proliferation in response to inhibition of HEMF-derived factors.
  Epithelial cells (2000 cells/well of 96-well plate) were treated with KSFM (epithelial
  cell media) or supernatant of untreated and acidic-bile-salt-treated HEMFs (in background
  KSFM media overnight) in the presence and absence of neutralizing antibodies for
  CXCL-8 and AREG. Results shown represent the means Â± SEM of three independent experiments
  conducted with a HEMF cell line * p < 0.05; NS, nonsignificant with ANOVA with multiple
  comparisons.
