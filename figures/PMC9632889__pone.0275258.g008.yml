figure_title: Leonurine decreased ROS production by flow cytometric detection in H9c2
  cells stimulated by TGF-β
caption: 'DCFH-DA was used to evaluate the intracellular ROS level. DCFH-DA is a nonfluorescent
  ester of the dye fluorescent product in the presence of ROS. (A) The peak value
  of the model group shifted to the right, and the peak value of the leonurine group
  shifted to the left. (B) ROS production increased with TGF-β exposure, and pretreatment
  with leonurine inhibited the ROS increase after TGF-β stimulation. ##P<0.01, model
  group vs. control group; **P<0.01, 20 μM leonurine group vs. model group. DCFH-DA,
  2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate.'
