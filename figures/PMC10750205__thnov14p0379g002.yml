caption: Known mechanisms how endosialin stimulates tumor angiogenesis. Pericyte expressed
  endosialin and endothelial cell expressed CLEC14A simultaneously bind with MMRN2
  at the interface between the endothelium and pericytes to promote tumor angiogenesis.
  Endosialin could activate ERK1/2/c-Fos pathway to promote pericytes proliferation.
  Endosialin could activate Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling and upregulate two angiogenic
  factors, OPN and SERPINE1, in pericytes to promote tumor angiogenesis.
