caption: Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway is downstream of SP4/PHF14. A, Viability
  of ESCC cells after treatment with Vector, ov-SP4, ov-SP4+LGK974. B, Cell number
  of ESCC cells after treatment with Vector, ov-SP4, ov-SP4+LGK974. C, The cell cycle
  of ESCC cells after treatment with vector, ov-SP4, ov-SP4+LGK974. D, Apoptosis of
  ESCC cells after treatment with vector, ov-SP4, ov-SP4+LGK974. E, Wnt3a, β-catenin
  expressions were measured after treatment with Vector, ov-SP4, ov-SP4+LGK974. GAPDH
  was used as an internal reference. F, PHF14, Wnt3a, β-catenin, CDK4, CDK6, Cyclin
  D1, and active caspase-3 expressions were measured after treatment with Vector,
  ov-SP4, ov-SP4+LGK974. GAPDH was used as an internal reference. Each experiment
  was performed in triplicate. According to the data characteristics, quantitative
  data of A–D were analyzed by Student t test. *, P < 0.05.
