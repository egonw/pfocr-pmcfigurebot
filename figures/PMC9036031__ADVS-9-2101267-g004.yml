caption: The activity profiles of multiple mitochondrial complex assemblies and metabolic
  and molecular pathways were significantly changed in the Tregs of mouse esophageal
  tumors compared with the normal esophageal tissues. The activity the of mitochondrial
  complexes, i.e., Complex I, III, and IV; OXPHOS pathways; and glycolysis, of the
  mouse tumor Tregs was significantly higher than that of the control normal Tregs.
  In addition, Tregs from tumor‐bearing mice had upregulated apoptosis and reactive
  oxygen species pathway activity compared with the CD4IL2RALO Tregs from the normal
  esophageal tissue samples.
