caption: BECN1 plays a key role in the autophagy pathway induced by NS1SC09. (A) 293T
  cells were stimulated with starvation or treated with Eug or Cal, and BECN1 KO cells
  were over-expressed with BECNF123A-Flag as indicated. The cells mentioned above
  were transfected with indicated plasmids above. Cell lysates were subjected to Flag-IP.
  (B and C) 293T cells, BECN1 KO cells, and BECN1 KO cells overexpressing of BECN1-Flag
  or Becin1F123A-Flag as indicated above were infected with WSN, WSN-NS1SC09, or WSN-NS1JL89
  at the MOI of 5.0 and 0.01. The supernatants were sampled at 24 h post-infection,
  and the viral titers were determined with endpoint titration in MDCK cells. The
  cell lysates were prepared and analyzed using western bloting. (D-G) 293T cells
  and A549 cells were infected with WSN, WSN-NS1SC09, or WSN-NS1JL89 after stimulation
  with starvation or treatment with Eug or Cal as indicated above. The supernatants
  were sampled at 24 h post-infection, and the viral titers were determined using
  endpoint titration in MDCK cells. The cell lysates were prepared and analyzed using
  western blotting. Error bars indicate the SD from three independent experiments.
