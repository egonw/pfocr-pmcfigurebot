caption: Gene expression profiles of (a) FABP, CD36, IRS1, PCK1, THBS1, and TGFB1
  in colorectal cancer (CRC). Boxplot showing transcriptional levels of differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) (n = 275) vs. normal samples
  (n = 349) and rectal adenocarcinoma (READ) (n = 92) vs. normal tissues (n = 318)
  using the GEPIA web tool based on TCGA database. Black colors show transcriptional
  levels in normal tissues, while red colors show DEG transcriptional levels in COAD
  and READ tissues. One-way ANOVA was used for the differential analysis with a statistically
  significant value of p < 0.05. (b) All stages of CRC are shown for cancer progression
  of the five DEGs. A violin plot shows different stages of cancer with log2 (transcripts
  per million (TPM) + 1) of genes in stages I to IV. A t-test was used with the statistically
  significant p < 0.05. The Pr(>F) < 0.05, followed by Student's t-test.
