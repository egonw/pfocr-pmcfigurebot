caption: Effects of glycolytic pathway and ATP synthase inhibition in vitro on Th1-conditionated
  CD4+ T cells that express or not P2RX7. Splenic naïve CD4+ T cells from B6 and P2rx7-/-
  mice were activated in vitro under Th1 conditions. Th0 condition was used as control.
  (A) Histograms show T-bet and Blimp-1 expression in CD4+ T cells under Th0 or Th1
  conditions. Column bar graphs show T-bet and Blimp-1 MFIs. (B) Column bar graph
  shows IFNγ production. (C) Histogram shows FSC-A of CD4+ T cells and the medians
  are shown in the column bar graphs. (D) Contour plots show CD44 versus CD25 expression
  in CD4+ T cells. Column bar graph shows CD44+CD25+ T cell frequencies. (E) Contours
  plots show T-bet and Blimp-1 expression of in Th0 or Th1 cells in the absence or
  presence of 2DG or oligomycin (oligo). Column bar graph shows T-bet+Blimp-1+CD4+
  T cell frequencies per well. (F) The t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding
  (t-SNE) maps show CD4+ T cell clusters from concatenated samples in relation to
  cell density. (G) Histograms show FSC-A and CD44, CD127 and CD25 expression in CD4+
  T cells. Data are shown as the mean ± SD (n = 3) of one representative experiment
  out of three. Significant differences were observed for the (-) indicated groups
  and (*) between Th1 and Th0 cells with p < 0.05, using Mann Whitney U test.
