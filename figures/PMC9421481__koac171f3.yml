caption: Levels of lignin biosynthetic protein families in mature stem tissues of
  Brachypodium RNAi lines. Protein levels were determined in mature stem internodes
  harvested from plants at 30 days after germination and measured by LC–MS/MS. Heatmap
  displays log2 FCs in abundance of lignin protein homologs in RNAi-mediated lignin
  gene silenced lines. The target genes for RNA interference are shown in bold and
  highlighted with a black star. Each square represents the mean of four biological
  replicates. Right column shows relative intensity levels as proportion of the most
  abundant lignin protein (PTAL1). Independent replicated FC values compared with
  WT controls are shown in the box plots on the right. Raw protein abundances values
  are provided in . CHS, CHI, and flavonoid 3′hydroxylase (F3′H) were included in
  the study as representative flavonoid pathway proteins. Other proteins are abbreviated
  as described in . Blue and green asterisks indicate significantly downregulated
  and upregulated proteins, respectively (P < 0.05, one-way ANOVA with post hoc Dunnett’s
  test). Box plots indicate the median (center lines), interquartile range (hinges)
  and whiskers represents min and max values.
