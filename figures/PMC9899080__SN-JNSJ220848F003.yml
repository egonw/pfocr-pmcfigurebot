caption: CIE shifts the excitatory-inhibitory balance in the vlPAG/DRDA-dBNST pathway.
  A, Schematics for whole-cell recordings from dBNST neurons 24 h post-CIE. ChR2-assisted
  circuit mapping was used to record cell populations in the dBNST innervated by vlPAG/DR
  inputs. B, There was no change in the percentage of total light-responsive dBNST
  neurons between the two groups. C, Representative traces of monosynaptic oEPSC amplitudes
  (shorter latency; gray traces) and polysynaptic oIPSC amplitudes (longer latency;
  red traces) from the same neuron held at −55 and +10 mV, respectively, in response
  to 1- to 5-ms blue light stimulation. While there was no difference in oEPSC amplitudes
  between air and CIE mice (D), there was a nonsignificant trend toward a reduction
  in oIPSC amplitudes in CIE-exposed mice (E). F, Comparison of E/I ratio between
  the two groups, revealed a significant increase in E/I ratio in CIE mice, suggesting
  a shift toward a hyperexcitable state in the vlPAG/DRDA-dBNST pathway. G, Representative
  traces of sEPSCs (black/gray traces; at −55 mV) and sIPSCs (red traces; at +10 mV)
  recorded from the neurons that were also innervated by vlPAG/DR inputs. There was
  no difference between groups in either spontaneous excitatory transmission [sEPSC
  frequency (H) and amplitude (I)] or spontaneous inhibitory transmission [sIPSC frequency
  (J) and amplitude (K)]. However, CIE-exposed mice had a significantly greater SE/I
  frequency ratio (L). Data expressed as mean ± SEM; *p < 0.05.
