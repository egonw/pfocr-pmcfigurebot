caption: Expression of network genes in immunocompetent and immunocompromised hamsters
  infected with SARS-CoV-2. (a) Heat map of SDEG involved in the inflammatory response
  in immunocompetent hamster lungs at 4 dpi. (b) Heat map of SDEG involved in the
  inflammatory response in immunocompromised hamster lungs at 4 dpi (4 dpi CP). (c)
  Heat map of SDEG involved in NK cell activation network in immunocompetent (4 dpi)
  and immunocompromised (4 dpi CP) hamster lungs at 4 dpi. (d) Heat map of SDEG involved
  in canonical MPN-RON signaling in macrophages network in immunocompetent (16 dpi)
  and immunocompromised (16 dpi CP) hamster lungs at 16 dpi. (e) Heat map of SDEG
  involved in prothrombin signaling network in immunocompetent (16 dpi) and immunocompromised
  (16 dpi CP) hamster lungs at 16 dpi. (f) Heat map of SDEG involved in canonical
  LXR/RXR signaling pathway in immunocompetent (16 dpi) and immunocompromised (16
  dpi CP) hamster lungs at 16 dpi. (g) Heat map of SDEG involved in B cell recruitment
  and accumulation network in immunocompetent (16 dpi) and immunocompromised (16 dpi
  CP) hamster lungs at 16 dpi. Scale bar shows up (red) and downregulation (green).
