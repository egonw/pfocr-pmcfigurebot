figure_title: Spatio-temporal alteration in epithelial and fibroblast signaling patterns
  of pre- and postnatal gastroesophageal tissues
caption: a Heatmap of gene set enrichment scores of fibroblasts and epithelial cells
  of esophagus and stomach from embryonic to adult time points with specific pathways
  highlighted; column represents individual cells colored by tissue type and time
  point; colors in the scale bar denotes the z-scored enrichment values ranging from
  high (deep pink) to low (blue). b, c Heatmap comparing the overall (aggregated both
  incoming and outgoing) signaling patterns associated with both fibroblast and epithelial
  compartments in the esophagus (b) and stomach (c) between E19 and adult time points.
  The color bar denotes the relative signaling strength (row-scaled values) of a pathway
  across cell types and time points. The relative strength of a pathway is calculated
  by normalizing each row of values to fall within the range 0-1 and depicted as low
  (white) to high (dark brown). Colored bar plot on top depicts the total signaling
  strength of a particular cell type by summarizing all pathways in the heatmap. d
  Dot plot showing the expression levels of ligands, receptors, and modulators associated
  with key signaling pathways in both fibroblasts and the epithelial subpopulation
  of esophagus and stomach at E19 and adult stages. Dot size represents the percentage
  of cells expressing a particular gene; the color bar indicates the intensity of
  scaled mean expression levels ranging from high (red) to low (blue). Genes are color-coded
  based on the signaling pathways to which they belong.
