caption: Effects of pLXSN and WT-TP53 on the colony formation in soft agar in the
  presence of docetaxel. The effects of pLXSN and WT-TP53 on the colony formation
  in soft agar in MIA-PaCa-2 and PANC-28 cells were examined. (A) MIA-PaCa-2 + pLXSN
  (red bars) and MIA-PaCa-2 + WT-TP53 (blue bars) were compared in response to docetaxel.
  (B) PANC-28 + pLXSN (red bars) and PANC-28 + WT-TP53 (blue bars) were compared in
  response to docetaxel. The colonies for each cell line were normalized to untreated
  so that the results from pLXSN and WT-TP53 could be compared. These studies were
  repeated and similar results were observed. ***P < 0.0001, **P < 0.005 and *P <
  0.05, NS = not statistically significant.

  pathway inhibitors, nutraceuticals and alter metabolic properties.
