caption: Hypothetical model for neuronal activity modulation of angiogenesis in neonate
  rodents. (A) Under environmental normoxic conditions, co-active neurons contribute
  to generate an intermittent hypoxic environment that favors proangiogenic signaling
  through the HIF/VEGF pathway. Neuron to astrocyte communication may contribute to
  VEGF production through unidentified signals. (B) Under environmental hypoxic conditions,
  a sustained hypoxic environment is imposed in the brain parenchyma. Sustained hypoxia
  inhibits electrical activity in neurons and potentially, signaling from neurons
  to astrocytes. Despite favorable conditions for HIF/VEGF signaling, VEGF levels
  are reduced resulting in a decrease in the angiogenic response. (C) Under environmental
  hyperoxic conditions, a sustained hyperoxic environment is imposed on the brain
  parenchyma. Sustained hyperoxia is favorable for neuronal activity but not for HIF/VEGF
  signaling in neurons. Altered VEGF release and aberrant angiogenic responses are
  hypothesized to originate from abnormal neuron to astrocyte signaling. Circles represent
  neurons. Triangles represent astrocytes. Red cylinders represent blood vessels expressing
  VEGF receptors (VEGFR), shown in blue. Active cells and pathways are shown in purple
  and black, respectively. Inactive cells and pathways are shown in gray. HIF/VEGF
  signaling pathway has been adapted from Leu et al. (). HIF, hypoxia inducible transcription
  factor; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor.
