figure_title: Multi-omics-based profiling of the tumor and normal thyroid samples
caption: a Pathway categories enriched by the DEMs. b Heatmap showing the top-rank
  DEMs. Only molecules with the top-10 significant P values for each omics type are
  listed. The metabolite levels for TG, FFA, PG, and SPH were the summarized abundances
  of different kinds of TG, FFA, PG, and SPH. The suffix Pro and Phos, respectively,
  represent proteins and phosphoproteins. DESeq2 (two-sided) was applied to find the
  differentially expressed genes, and the Wilcox test (paired, two-sided) was applied
  to find the differentially expressed metabolites, proteins and phosphoproteins.
  P values were adjusted by Benjamini–Hochberg method. c Venn diagram of the pathways
  respectively enriched by the DEMs determined by transcriptomics, proteomics and
  phospho-proteomics. d Pathway enrichment results. Only pathways showing significance
  in at least three types of omics are shown. Enrichment was examined by hypergeometric
  distribution, one-sided, and P values were adjusted by the Benjamini– Hochberg method.
  e The multi-omics differences between tumor and normal samples considering the glycolysis
  pathway. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.
