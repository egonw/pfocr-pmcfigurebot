caption: 'NAD+ exposure affects the proliferation of adult neural stem/progenitor
  cells in vitro. (A) Representative images of BrdU immunostaining with control (Ctrl)
  and NAD+-treated adult neural stem/progenitor cells (aNSPCs). Scale bar, 50 μm.
  (B) Quantification results show that NAD+ exposure decreased the percentages of
  BrdU+ cells under proliferation conditions. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM.
  n = 3 independent experiments, unpaired t-test. (C) Representative images of Ki67
  immunostaining with Ctrl and NAD+-treated aNSPCs. Scale bar, 50 μm. (D) Quantification
  results show that NAD+ exposure decreased the percentages of Ki67+ cells. Data are
  presented as the mean ± SEM. n = 3 independent experiments, unpaired t-test. (E)
  Representative images of neurospheres derived from single aNSPCs. aNSPCs were supplemented
  with 1 mM NAD+ and analyzed at days 7 and 14. Scale bar: 50 μm. (F,G) Quantification
  results show that NAD+ exposure decreased the size of neurospheres at day 7 (F)
  and day 14 (G). Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. n = 30 neurospheres for Ctrl
  and NAD+ exposure groups at each timepoint. unpaired t-test. (H,I) The relative
  mRNA levels of Nestin and Sox2 of Ctrl and NAD+ supplemented aNSPCs. Data are presented
  as the mean ± SEM. n = 3 independent experiments, unpaired t-test. (J–L) Western
  blot assay (J) and quantification results (K,L) show that NAD+ exposure decreased
  the level of Nestin and Sox2. GAPDH was used as an internal control. Data are presented
  as the mean ± SEM. n = 3 independent experiments, unpaired t-test; *, p < 0.05;
  **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001.'
