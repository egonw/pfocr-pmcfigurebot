caption: Different metabolic reprogramming of macrophages in patients with mild or
  severe COVID-19(A) t-SNE visualization of macrophages in BALFs of 4 HCs, 3 mild
  and 6 severe COVID-19 donors based on 1,526 metabolic gene-expression profiles.
  Macrophages were highlighted in red in left panel and color-coded for sample types
  in right panel.(B) A flowchart depicting the basic principle and procedures for
  the calculation of metabolic pathway activity.(C and D) Metabolic pathway activities
  in macrophages from HC versus patients with mild (C), or severe (D) COVID-19. Statistically
  non-significant values (random permutation test p > 0.01) were shown as blank.(E)
  Metabolic pathway activities of core metabolic pathways in macrophages from patients
  with HC, mild, or severe COVID-19.(F) Dot plots show expression of indicated metabolic
  genes.(G) Feature plots show the expression level of indicated metabolic genes and
  chemokine CCL2 in macrophages.
