figure_title: Withdrawal selectively decreases post-synaptic glutamate transmission
  in mPFCCRF1+ neurons, which is partly mediated by the basolateral amygdala
caption: A Representative traces of average spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents
  (sEPSC) recorded with a holding potential of −70 mV in mPFCCRF1− pyramidal neurons
  from naïve, dependent, and withdrawn mice. B, C Average sEPSC frequency and amplitude
  in mPFCCRF1− neurons from naïve (white), dependent (black), and withdrawn (grey)
  mice. n = 12–22 cells from N = 6–10 male mice; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 by one-way
  ANOVA and post hoc multiple comparisons compared to naive. D Representative traces
  of average sEPSCs recorded with a holding potential of −70 mV in mPFCCRF1+ neurons
  from naïve, dependent, and withdrawn mice. E, F Average sEPSC frequency and amplitude
  in mPFCCRF1+ pyramidal neurons from naïve (green), dependent (white), and withdrawn
  (grey) mice. n = 10–21 cells from N = 6–10 male mice; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 by one-way
  ANOVA and post hoc multiple comparisons compared to naive. G Schematic of viral
  strategy for ex vivo optogenetic circuit dissection of glutamate transmission in
  the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to mPFCCRF1+pathway. Representative 4X magnification,
  brightfield and mCherry fluorescence images of injection site expression of channelrhodopsin-2
  (ChR2)-mCherry in the BLA (right, top) and corresponding ChR2-mCherry BLA terminal
  in the mPFC (right, bottom). H ChR2-mediated photocurrents in mCherry expressing
  BLA neurons elicited by pulses and increasing trains of blue-light stimulation from
  a holding potential of −70 mV. I Representative BLA-mediated AMPA currents in mPFCCRF1+
  neurons elicited by paired pulse stimulation (traces scaled to first EPSC) of two
  consecutive blue light pulses (3 ms, 470 nm) with an interstimulus interval of 200 ms
  from a holding potential −80 mV. J Average paired pulse ratio (i.e., amplitude of
  the second response normalized to that of the first) in mPFCCRF1+ neurons from naïve,
  dependent, and withdrawn mice with a significant F(2,57) = 4.27, p = 0.01 effect
  by one-way ANOVA, and post hoc significance *p < 0.05 compared to naïve is represented
  in panel. n = 12–27 cells from N = 5–6 male mice. K Average ± SEM BLA-mediated NMDA
  (top row) and AMPA (bottom row) currents in mPFCCRF1+ neurons from naïve (green),
  dependent (black), and withdrawn (grey) mice. L Average AMPA/NMDA ratio in mPFCCRF1+
  neurons from naïve, dependent, and withdrawn mice with a significant F(2,86) = 6.79,
  p = 0.001 effect by one-way ANOVA, and post hoc significance *p < 0.05 compared
  to naïve is represented in panel. n = 17–39 cells from N = 5–6 male mice. M Average ± SEM
  BLA-mediated AMPA currents elicited by blue light pulses during baseline and following
  200 nM CRF application from a holding potential of −80 mV in mPFCCRF1+ neurons from
  naive, dependent, and withdrawn mice. N Average baseline normalized AMPA amplitude
  elicited by optical stimulation of BLA terminals with a significant F(2,16) = 3.55,
  p = 0.05 effect of CRF across groups by one-way ANOVA and post hoc multiple comparisons,
  and significant *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 effects of CRF by one sample t-test. n = 4–11
  cells from N = 3–6 male mice per group.
