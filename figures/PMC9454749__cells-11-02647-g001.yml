caption: 'Schematic of the mechanisms involved in BIND induced neurotoxicity. Left:
  Metabolic pathway leading to unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) production. Heme is converted
  into biliverdin by heme oxygenase (HMOX-1 and 2), located in mitochondria, endoplasmic
  reticulum and caveolae. Biliverdin is then converted into unconjugated bilirubin
  by biliverdin reductase. Right: Neurons are depicted in this scheme to represent
  the toxic effects of UCB in brain cells. Neurons are known to be the most affected
  cell type in UCB toxicity, which involves multiple pathways leading to distinct
  toxic events, including disruption of the mitochondrial energetic breakdown, ionic
  imbalance, extracellular accumulation of glutamate, release of inflammatory cytokines
  by glial cells (here depicted as microglia and astrocytes), as well as increase
  in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative stress. This UCB-induced
  cytotoxicity can result in apoptosis (the different cell type sizes are not depicted
  to scale, but rather schematically to simplify the view of the mechanisms) (Created
