caption: 'Limonene‐producing E. coli strains and GC‐MS measurements. a) Metabolic
  pathway from Acetyl‐CoA to limonene in E. coli. Enzymes and some of the reaction
  intermediates necessary for the production of limonene are shown. AtoB: acetoacetyl‐CoA
  synthase; HMGS: HMG‐CoA synthase; HMGR: MG‐CoA reductase; MK: Mevalonate Kinase;
  PMK: PhosphoMevalonate Kinase; PMD: PhosphoMevalonate Decarboxylase; IPP: isopentenyl
  pyrophosphate; idi: isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase; DMAPP: dimenthylallyl pyrophosphate;
  GPPS: Geranyl PyroPhosphate Synthase; GPP: geranyl pyrophosphate; LS: limonene synthase.
  b) Genetic design of limonene pathway for strains with a two‐plasmid system. c)
  GC‐MS measurements of microbial production of limonene (BW25113 strain with a two‐plasmid
  system). Error bar: std.'
