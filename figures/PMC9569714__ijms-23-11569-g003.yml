caption: Possible mechanisms of catechins improving insulin resistance. Adiposity
  or inflammatory cytokines may lead to inflammation, oxidative stress and endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) stress inside the cell. All of these stresses activate c-Jun N-terminal
  protein kinase (JNK), inhibitory κB Kinase (IKK), and the protein kinase C (PKC)
  signaling pathway, by which the function of insulin receptor substrates 1 (IRS1)
  is suppressed, decreasing its capacity to regulate downstream events in the insulin
  cascade. In addition, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) will be up-regulated
  by the activated IKK/NF-κB signaling pathway. This response will result in dephosphorylation
  and inactivation of the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrates 1.
  Catechins have been confirmed to change the oxidative stress events by inhibiting
  the ROS production of mitochondria, resulting in inhibiting the activation of a
  series of intracellular signal pathways and reducing the occurrence of insulin resistance.
  Red solid arrows indicate upregulation or activation, black solid lines indicate
  inhibition, black broken lines indicate inhibition of catechins.
