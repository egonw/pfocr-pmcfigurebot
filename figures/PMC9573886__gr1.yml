caption: 'Thickness of the condyle cartilage in the control and overloading groups
  at 2w, 4w, and 8w. A, B: Intraoral views of the mandible advanced appliance model.
  C: Schematic diagram. D: Schematic diagram of the histological layer of the condyle
  head (Fibro fibrous layer; Prolif proliferative layer; Hypertrophic layer, Endochondral
  ossification bone layer, Subchondral bone layer). The sagittal section of the central
  condyle was stained with hematoxylin and eosin (× 200). E: All layers of condylar
  cartilage in the overload group were thinner than those in the control group, especially
  the hypertrophic layer. F, G: Comparison of the total cartilage thickness and thickened
  layer thickness among all groups. The layers of condylar cartilage, especially the
  thickened layer, were thinner in the loading group than in the control group. (∗P
  < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001).'
article_title: Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is activated in the progress of mandibular
  condylar cartilage degeneration and subchondral bone loss induced by overloaded
