caption: RIP140 overexpressed RPE cells exert lower mitochondrial activity and present
  higher cytoplasmic glycogen concentration. (A,B) RIP140 overexpressed RPE cells
  have significantly lower mitochondrial activity as compared to GFP effected-RPE
  cells, as indicated by ATP levels measured by a luminescence assay in the absence
  (A) and presence (B) of hexokinase inhibitor. (C) Measurement of cytoplasmic glycogen
  accumulation by colorimetric assay showing higher concentration in RIP140 groups
  compared to control group. * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001 vs. Ad-GFP group.
