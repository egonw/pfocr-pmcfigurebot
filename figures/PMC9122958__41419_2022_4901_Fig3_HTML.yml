figure_title: WNT5A overexpression facilitates the migration, invasion, and metastasis
  of ESCC cells
caption: A, B Representative images and statistical analysis of wound healing assays
  and Transwell migration/invasion assays using EC109 or KYSE450 cells overexpressing
  WNT5A. The migratory ability in wound healing assays was expressed as the mean scratch
  area. The initial scratch area (0 h) was set to 100%. C Representative fluorescence
  images of nude mice 7 weeks after the tail vein injection. D Representative images
  of HE staining of lung samples and statistical analysis of the metastatic nodules
  per lung from the indicated groups (n = 5 per group). Scale bars, 1 mm and 100 μm
  (inset). *P < 0.05 compared with the NC group.
article_title: WNT5A promotes the metastasis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
  by activating the HDAC7/SNAIL signaling pathway.
