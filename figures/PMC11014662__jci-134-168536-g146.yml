figure_title: Human T-ALL cell lines with high STAT5 activation display upregulated
  expression of TCR pathway genes
caption: (A) Basal levels of phosphorylated (pY) and total (t) STAT5, STAT3, and TCR
  pathway proteins in 9 T-ALL and 2 AML control cell lines, evaluated by Western blot
  analysis. Actin served as loading control. (B) Sanger sequencing of the SH2 and
  TAD domains of STAT5B. cDNA was obtained from isolated RNA of KOPT-K1 and DND-41
  cells. The codon for amino acid position 642 is highlighted in blue. (C) Z scores
  of raw counts of TCR pathway genes from RNA-Seq data from 9 T-ALL cell lines. Three
  biological triplicates were acquired from each cell line and cell lines were arranged
  according to their pY-STAT5 level as determined by Western blot. (D) ChIP-Seq peak
  signals indicating STAT5B binding at the promoter region of 6 TCR pathway genes
  as indicated in 6 T-ALL cell lines. Normalized ChIP-Seq signal (CPM) is indicated
  on the y axis. (E) Peak analysis for STAT5B binding sites in TCR pathway genes from
  6 T-ALL cell lines and indication of peak localization within respective genes or
  enhancers.
