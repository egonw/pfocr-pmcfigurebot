caption: Knockdown of ESE1 expression affects the TGF‐β network in PDAC cells. RNA‐seq
  analysis was performed in L3.6‐shCtrl versus L3.6‐shESE1 cells to determine the
  DEGs. (A) Volcano map of DEGs. The blue dots represented down‐regulated genes while
  red dots represented up‐regulated genes with the number of down‐ and up‐regulated
  genes shown blow. (B) Bubble map of DEGs in L3.6‐shCtrl versus L3.6‐shESE1 cells
  based on KEGG pathway analyses. (C) Bubble map of GO pathway analyses on DEGs in
  L3.6‐shCtrl versus L3.6‐shESE1 cells. GSEA analysis based on DEGs in L3.6‐shCtrl
  versus L3.6‐shESE1 cells to compare the changes related to TGF‐β signaling pathway
  (D) and pancreatic cancer (E) using the KEGG gene sets.
