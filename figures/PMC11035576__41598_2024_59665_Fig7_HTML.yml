caption: A proposed scheme illustrating the effect and mechanism of dexrazoxane on
  ESCC progression. Dexrazoxane targeted PDZ1 domain of SDCBP and attenuated the binding
  ability between SDCBP and EGFR. Moreover, dexrazoxane impaired EGFR membrane localization
  and inhibited EGFR/PI3K/Akt pathway. Finally, ESCC progression was inhibited due
  to decreased cell proliferation, increased cell apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest.

  by attenuating SDCBP/MDA-9/syntenin-mediated EGFR-PI3K-Akt pathway activation.
