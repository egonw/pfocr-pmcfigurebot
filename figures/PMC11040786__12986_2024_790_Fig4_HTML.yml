caption: 'SPX induces thermogenic gene expression and browning in WAT of HFD mice.
  (A) Immunoblotting for indicated proteins in WAT of the mice. The protein (B) and
  mRNA (D) expression levels of UCP-1, TBX1 and CIDEA in WAT. (C) Immunohistochemical
  staining of UCP-1 in WAT (scale bar: 100 μm). All values are represented as means
  with error bars representing S.D. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01. n = 6 for each group'
