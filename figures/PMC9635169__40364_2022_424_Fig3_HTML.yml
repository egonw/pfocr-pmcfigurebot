caption: miR-637 inhibits IL-8 expression and cancer stemness in a WASH-dependent
  manner. KYSE70 cells stably transduced with negative control shRNA (shNC) or WASH
  shRNA (shWASH) were treated with NC inhibitor or miR-637 inhibitor. A, B qRT-PCR
  (A) or Western blotting (B) assays showed the failure of miR-637 inhibitor to induce
  WASH expression in KWSE70 cells with WASH knockdown. C, D qRT-PCR (C) or tumor sphere
  formation (D) assays showed the failure of miR-637 inhibitor to induce IL-8 expression
  and sphere formation capacity in KWSE70 cells with WASH knockdown, respectively.
  Scale bar, 200 μm. E The relative expression of stemness markers were measured by
  qRT-PCR. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation. ns, not significant; *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
article_title: Loss of miR-637 promotes cancer cell stemness via WASH/IL-8 pathway
  and serves as a novel prognostic marker in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
