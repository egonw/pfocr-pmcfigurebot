caption: Effect of magnoflorine on neuronal damage and oxidant stress following cerebral
  ischemia in rats. Representative images of the Nissl staining in the cerebral cortex
  (a) and quantification the injured neurons (c) were shown. Brain sections were stained
  with NeuN (green) and DAPI (blue) to monitor the density of neurons. (b) Representative
  immunofluorescent staining in the cerebral cortex of rats. (d) The neuron density
  was quantified. (e-f) The concentrations of NO, MDA, GSH, GSH-PX in the serum or
  brain tissues were detected. Scale bar, 100 µm. Values are mean ± SEM, n = 5 per
  group. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001. MNF, magnoflorine; BBR, berberine; MCAO,
  middle cerebral artery occlusion; NO, nitric oxide; MDA, malondialdehyde; GSH, glutathione;
  PX, peroxidase.
