caption: MdS6PDH1 played important roles in apple resistance to B. dothidea. a Representative
  phenotypes of Vec, MdS6PDH1-OE, and MdS6PDH1-RNAi calli infected with B. dothidea.
  b Pathogen disease index in Vec (empty vector control) and transgenic calli infected
  with B. dothidea for 4 days. c, d qRT–PCR analysis of the expression of the SA signaling
  pathway marker genes and SA synthesis-related genes in Vec and transgenic calli
  infected with B. dothidea. e Representative phenotypes of MdS6PDH1-RNAi calli infected
  with B. dothidea after exogenous sorbitol treatment. The error bars indicate the
  means ± standard errors of three independent experiments (n = 9). *P < .05; **P < .01;
  ***P < .001. Different letters indicate significant differences (P < .01) based
  on Tukey’s HSD test.
