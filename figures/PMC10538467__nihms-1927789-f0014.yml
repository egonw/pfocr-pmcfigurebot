caption: GO Biological Process FDRs for signaling pathwaysGO Biological Process enrichment
  analysis of metagene-factors. For every pathway and factor, we selected the metagene
  with lowest FDR and depicted statistically significant values (FDR < 0.05). Point
  sizes are inversely proportional to the FDR values. Type I interferons (IFNs), a
  family of cytokines that activate a variety of signaling cascades, were the most
  enriched. We also detected the simultaneous enrichment of interferon IRF1 and STAT1
  (a member of the STAT protein family that drives the expression of many target genes)
  in 10 factors (FDR < 0.05; ), consistent with these results.
