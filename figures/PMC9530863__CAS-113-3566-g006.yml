caption: LRFN2 regulates the Wnt/β‐catenin pathway and the NF‐κB pathway. (A) The
  dataset for LRFN2 expression in ESCC from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
  (KEGG) database was assessed using bioinformatics and gene set enrichment analysis
  (GSEA). The results showed that, among all enrichment pathways, LRFN2 was most likely
  to regulate the Wnt/β‐catenin pathway. (B) Network prediction and annotation of
  LRFN2 with other molecules was performed using the STRING database. (C) Co‐immunoprecipitation
  experiments revealed that LRFN2, GRIN2B, and PSD‐95 bind to each other. (D) Using
  immunoprecipitation, we found that GRIN2B binds to GSK3β and LRFN2 binds to β‐catenin.
  (E) Immunofluorescence experiments showed that LRFN2, GRIN2B, and PSD‐95 were colocalized
  in the nucleus of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells. (F) LRFN2 overexpression
  upregulated the expression of p‐GSK3β and downregulated the expression levels of
  β‐catenin, c‐Myc, and cyclin D1 in TE1 and KYSE30 cells. In a xenograft tumor, LRFN2
  inhibited the key proteins of the Wnt/β‐catenin pathway, which was consistent with
  the results of experiments in vitro. After knockdown of LRFN2 expression in KYSE150,
  the changes in key proteins in the WNT pathway were opposite to those when LRFN2
  was overexpressed. (G) Expression of NF‐κB and BCL2 was inhibited when LRFN2 was
  overexpressed. However, after knocking down LRFN2, the expression of NF‐κB and BCL2
  increased. (H) Using RSPO‐1 to agonize the WNT pathway, in the control group, the
  expression of β‐catenin also increased with the increase in drug concentration.
  But in the LRFN2 overexpression group, β‐catenin expression did not change with
  the increase in drug concentration. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.001
