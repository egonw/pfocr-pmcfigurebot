caption: Anlotinib (ALTN) suppresses SETD1A and induces the p53-dependent apoptosis
  pathway. DOHH-2 and RL cells were incubated with 2.5 µM or 5 µM anlotinib for the
  indicated times, and the expression of SETD1A, MDM2 (A-B), p53 and phospho-p53 (Ser15)
  (C-D) were determined by western blotting.
