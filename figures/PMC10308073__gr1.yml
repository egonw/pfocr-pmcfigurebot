caption: Contribution of AT-rich interactive domain 5a (Arid5a) to interleukin (IL)-6
  production and disease. The innate immune response is generated by pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns, which are recognized by pathogen-recognition receptors and lead
  to the expression of proinflammatory mediators. For example, toll-like receptor
  4 recognizes lipopolysaccharide and activates the IKK/NF-κB signaling pathway. The
  IKK complex phosphorylates Regnase-1 and promotes transcription of IL-6 and Arid5a.
  Regnase-1 binds to the IL-6 mRNA and degrades it. In the nucleus, Arid5a binds to
  genes encoding transcription factors, such as Ppar-γ2, to inhibit their expression.
  Furthermore, Arid5a is shuttled to the cytoplasm under inflammatory conditions,
  where it interferes with the destabilizing effect of Regnase-1. Arid5a is involved
  in IL-6 mRNA stabilization, and the resulting increase in IL-6 production is associated
  with inflammation and autoimmune diseases. “Reprinted from Frontiers in Immunology,
