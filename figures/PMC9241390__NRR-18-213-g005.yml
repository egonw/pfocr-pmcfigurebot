caption: 'Protein expression of NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathway in microglia.(A)
  Representative western blot of TLR4, MyD88, p65, p-p65, IκBα, and p-IκBα expression
  and (B) the quantitative analysis of protein expression. (C) Representative western
  blot of p-p38, p38, p-ERK, ERK, p-JNK, and JNK expression in microglia and (D) the
  quantitative analysis of protein expression. The protein expression levels are relative
  to the control group (set to a relative protein expression value of 1). Data are
  shown as the mean ± SEM (n = 3). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 (one-way analysis
  of variance followed by Tukey’s post hoc tests). GAPDH: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; IκBα: nuclear factor-κB inhibitor alpha; LPS: lipopolysaccharide;
  MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; MyD88: myeloid differentiation primary response
  protein MyD88; NF-κB: nuclear factor-κB; p38: p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase;
  p65: transcription factor p65; p-p65: phosphorylated transcription factor p65; p-p38:
  phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase; p-ERK: phosphorylated ERK;
  p-IκBα: phosphorylated nuclear factor-κB inhibitor alpha; p-JNK: phosphorylated
  JNK; SEM: standard error of the mean; TLR4: toll-like receptor 4.'
