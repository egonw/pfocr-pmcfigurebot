caption: Stable CYP27C1-knockdown increases basal tyrosine phosphorylation level.
  Protein level of stable CYP27C1-knockdown A549 (A) stable CYP27C1-knockdown H1975
  cells (B) and the corresponding control cells was detected by immunoblot analysis.
  Grey scales of the bands were measured by Gel-Pro ANALYZER. Results were analyzed
  by unpaired two-tailed T test. Lines with blunt arrow indicated the comparison between
  different groups. *, p < 0.05.
