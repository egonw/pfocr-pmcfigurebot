caption: A novel mechanism for regulating lipid metabolism in oil crops and a metabolic
  pathway for FA and TAG synthesis in oilseeds. (A) In oil-palm mesocarp, mir5179
  inhibits MADS16 expression and regulates the expression of oil synthesis genes SAD,
  FAD2, and DGAT2. (B) ABA induces linoleic acid synthesis through ABA signaling pathway
  in oil palm mesocarp. (C) Induction of disease resistance in rice through regulating
  PR gene expression and wax synthesis by glycerol kinase OsNHO1. (D) Suppression
  of FAE1 expression for EA-free oil crop development. Suppressing FATB inhibits saturated-FA
  synthesis. Suppressing FAD2 expression blocks polyunsaturated-FA synthesis, resulting
  in elevated production of oleic acid. Black arrows indicate the direction of FA
  biosynthesis and metabolism. Blue dotted arrows indicate acyl-CoA migration. Blue
  letters indicate enzymes involved in the metabolic pathways. Red Xs indicate enzyme
  inhibition. FAS, fatty acid synthase; ACP, acyl carrier protein; KAS, KASII, 3-ketoacyl-ACP
  synthase II; FAB2, fatty acid biosynthesis2; G3P, glycerol-3phosphate; LPA, lysophosphatidic
  acid; PA, phosphatidic acid; DAG, diacylglycerol; TAG, triacylglycerol; CoA, coenzyme
  A; GPAT, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase; LPAT, lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase;
  PAP, phosphatidate phosphatase; DGAT, diacylglycerol acyltransferases; PDAT, phospholipid
  diacylglycerol acyltransferase; PC, phosphatidylcholine; FAD2, fatty acid desaturase
  2; FAD3, fatty acid desaturase 3; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FAE1, fatty acid elongase
  1; FATA, fatty acid thioesterase A; FATB, fatty acid thioesterase B; PDCT, phosphatidylcholine
  diacylglycerol choline phosphotransferase; PDAT, phosphatidylcholine diacylglycerol
  acyltransferase.
