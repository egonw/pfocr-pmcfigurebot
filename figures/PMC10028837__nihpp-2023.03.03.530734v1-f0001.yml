figure_title: Summary of the oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway including
  6-phosphogluconolactonase (Pgl), that converts 6-P-gluconololactone to gluconate-6-P
caption: For reference, key glycolysis, TCA cycle, nucleotide and cell wall biosynthetic
  pathway intermediates are also shown. Fructose-6-P is fluxed from glycolysis to
  peptidoglycan (PG), wall teichoic acid (WTA) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) via UDP-N-acetylglucosamine
  (UDP-GlcNAc) and UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid (UDP-MurNAc). Fosfomycin (FOS) targets
  MurA which together with MurB is required for the conversion of UDP-GlcNAc to UDP-MurNAc.
  Oxacillin (OX) targets the transpeptidase activity of the penicillin binding proteins
  required for PG crosslinking. The putative gluconate shunt involves the export of
  6-phosphogluconolactone, which spontaneously degrades to gluconate before being
  transported into the cell by the gluconate permease GntP and phosphorylated by the
  gluconate kinase GntK. Schematic made using Biorender.com.
