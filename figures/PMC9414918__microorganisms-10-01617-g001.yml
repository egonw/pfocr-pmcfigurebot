caption: 'Schematic showing the different electron transport routes discussed. (A)
  Under anaerobic conditions when the CBB cycle is not activated the hydrogenase acts
  as an electron valve and produces photoH2 when photosynthesis starts from darkness.
  Because of PSII forming O2, conditions turn more oxidizing after a short time and
  H2 evolution turns into hydrogen uptake (for an example see Figure 3). The electrons
  gained from H2 oxidation could follow three different routes. (B) The hydrogenase
  could directly reduce NADPH, which would than serve the CBB cycle while cyclic electron
  transport provides the necessary ATP. (C) In an alternative pathway H2 oxidation
  could result in ferredoxin reduction that is then re-oxidized by the photosynthetic
  NDH-1 complex. (D) In the third option, the hydrogenase could be part of the NDH-1
  complex and deliver the electrons directly to the PQ pool. Abbreviations: Fd = ferredoxin,
  FNR = ferredoxin NADP reductase, PSII and PSI = photosystem II and I, PQ = plastoquinone,
  Cyt b6f = cytochrome b6f complex, NDH-1 = photosynthetic complex I, CBB = Calvin–Benson–Bassham
  cycle.'
