caption: 'The Pearson correlation between gut microbiota and host responses. Circles
  in the balloon plot denoting the direction of the association are colored red (positive)
  or blue (negative) and are overlaid with the white symbol “*” indicating a significant
  correlation. Values marked with a white symbol “*” are significant correlations
  (p < 0.05), and “**” are very significant correlations (p < 0.01). WG: weight gain
  rate; FCR: feed conversion ratio; RB: respiratory burst activity; ACP: alternative
  complement pathway; SOD: copper-zinc superoxide dismutase; CAT: catalase; GPx: glutathione
  peroxidase; MDA: malondialdehyde; VE: Vitamin E; SROH: scavenging rate of hydroxyl
  radical.'
