caption: 'THBS2 negatively regulated Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway during OD procedure
  of VICs. (a–c) Representative images of protein bands during Western blot (a) and
  the levels of p-Akt/Akt (b) and p-p65/p65 (c) of VICs transfected with shTHBS2 and
  THBS2 overexpression plasmid were assessed by Western blot after the induction of
  OD. GAPDH was a loading control. (d) Relative expression of p65 in nucleus of VICs
  transfected with shTHBS2 and THBS2 overexpression plasmid was assessed by Western
  blot after the induction of OD. Lamin B1 was a loading control. (e) Relative mRNA
  expressions of THBS2, Akt, and p65 in VICs transfected with shTHBS2 and treated
  with LY294002 were tested by qRT-PCR after the induction of OD. GAPDH was a loading
  control. (f) Representative images of protein bands during Western blot. (g and
  h) The levels of p-Akt/Akt (g) and p-p65/p65 (h) of VICs transfected with shTHBS2
  and treated with LY294002 were determined through Western blot after the induction
  of OD. GAPDH was a loading control. (i) Relative protein expression of THBS2 in
  VICs transfected with shTHBS2 and treated with LY294002 was determined through Western
  blot after the induction of OD. GAPDH was a loading control. (j) and (k) Relative
  mRNA (j) and protein (k) expressions of p65 in nucleus of VICs transfected with
  shTHBS2 and treated with LY294002 were detected by Western blot after the induction
  of OD. Lamin B1 was a loading control. #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001 vs. vector
  group; ∗∗∗p < 0.01 vs. shTHBS2 group; ∧p < 0.05; ∧∧p < 0.01; ∧∧∧p < 0.001 vs. LY294002
  group. All experiments were repeated independently at least three times. Data were
  performed as the means ± standard deviation. Abbreviations: THBS2: thrombospondin
  2; OD: osteogenic differentiation; VICs: valve interstitial cells; p-: phosphorylation-;
  shTHBS2: short hairpin THBS2; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; qRT-PCR:
  quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.'
