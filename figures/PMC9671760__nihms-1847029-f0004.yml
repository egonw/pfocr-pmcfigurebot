figure_title: Canonical pathway profiling all day suggests an adaptation to acute
  fasting-refeeding in intermittent fasting
caption: (A) Data processing. The mean expression values of genes throughout the whole
  day were calculated from the expression values of six time points in a 24-h day
  within each feeding regimen and tissue. n = 5 mice/group.(B and C) The 3D-PCA plots
  of classes of the whole day gene expression (B) and pathway GSVA score (C) derived
  from five feeding regimens. n = 5 mice/group.(D) The pathway Spearman correlation
  heatmaps showing the evident negative correlation of AF with EODR or AR with EODF
  in all four metabolic tissues. Cells were shaded according to pathway Spearman correlation
  coefficients (blue, negative; red, positive) that were calculated from the whole-day
  GSVA scores. Feeding regimens are indicated on the left and/or the top of each heatmap
  (each color represents a feeding regimen, and each cell refers to a replicate).
  n = 5 mice/group.
