caption: Application of heterologous expression strategy in the study of fungal secondary
  metabolites. It mainly includes the screening of target BGCs, heterologous expression
  of recombinant strain, feeding of precursor, in vitro enzymatic verification, and
  identification of intermediate products, in order to predict the biosynthetic pathway.
