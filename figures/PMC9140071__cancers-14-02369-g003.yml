caption: UC.145 modulates the methylation of DKK1 in gastric cancer (GC). (a) Changes
  in expression of cancer related genes following siUC.145 treatment are shown compared
  to treatment with siControl (siCT). UC.145 is upregulated (green) or downregulated
  (red) under depleted conditions. The three genes with the most significantly altered
  expression are presented; (b) Expression of five genes simultaneously altered by
  siUC.145, EZH2 inhibitor, and GC related genes (GSE140394, genes involved in EZH2
  suppression; GSE54129 and GSE6495, genes involved in GC); (c) DKK1 expression validated
  in AGS and MKN74 cells using qRT-PCR; (d) DKK1 protein changes in AGS and MKN74
  cells transfected with siCT or siUC.145 confirmed by Western blotting; (e) Methylation
  changes detected using MS-PCR; (f) DKK1 expression in GC tissues according to classification
  based on the median expression of UC.145 using qRT-PCR; (g) Correlation between
  DKK1 mRNA level and UC.145 expression in GC samples quantified using the densitometry
  method with Prism; (h) UC.145 expression in 10 randomly selected GC samples using
  qRT-PCR. Western blotting results performed on the same tissues; (i) Correlation
  between UC.145 expression and DKK1 protein level in GC tissue quantified using density
  measurement with Prism; (j) Effect of DKK1 expression on cell proliferation in AGS
  and MKN74 cells in which the expression of UC.145 was suppressed (siControl (siCT),
  siUC.145 (si1, si2), or siDKK1). Data are shown as mean ± SD of three independent
  experiments (** p ≤ 0.01).
