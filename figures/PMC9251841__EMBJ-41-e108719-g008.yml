caption: Confocal image of fluorescently labelled transferrin (red) uptake by 143B
  cells under steady‐state conditions and in response to cyclic 0.1 Hz 200 mbar hydrostatic
  pressure. Cells labelled for Hoechst (blue). Scale bar = 20 μm.Quantification of
  transferrin uptake in 143B cells treated with hydrostatic pressure compared to steady
  state from images as in A. Each dot represents a single cell and error bars represent
  mean ± 95% CI. Data from four independent experiments. Mann–Whitney U test. ***
  P < 0.001.Confocal IF images of HEK293A cells. Cells are labelled with Dextran (green)
  and Hoechst (blue). HEK293A WT dextran uptake in response to 10 min (left) and 30 min

  images of LATS1/2 DKO HEK293A cells. Cells are labelled with Dextran (green) and
  Hoechst (blue). LATS1/2 DKO HEK293A dextran uptake in response to 10 min (left)
  and 30 min (right) cyclic hydrostatic pressure compared to steady state (Con). Scale
  bar = 20 μm.Changes in Dextran signal (30 min uptake) in response to cyclic hydrostatic
  pressure compared to control in WT, Y/T DKO and LATS1/2 DKO. Data obtained from
  images as in A‐C. Each dot represents a single cell from three independent experiments.
  Error bars represent mean ± 95% CI. Data points obtained from images as in A‐C.
  Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s post‐hoc. P = 0.1406 (WT), P = 0.6850 (Y/T DKO)
  and P > 0.9999 (LATS1/2 DKO).Dextran uptake (30 min) at steady state in Y/T DKO
  and LATS1/2 DKO cells relative to WT steady state. Each dot represents a single
  cell from three independent experiments. Data points obtained from images as in
  A‐C. Error bars represent mean ± 95% CI. Mann–Whitney U test. P > 0.9999.Dextran
  uptake (30 min) in response to hydrostatic pressure relative to steady state. Each
  dot represents a single cell from three independent experiments. Error bars represent
  mean ± 95% CI. Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s post‐hoc. P = 0.0542 (WT vs. Y/T
