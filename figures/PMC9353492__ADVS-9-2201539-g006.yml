caption: 'SC‐PDCC clones capture intratumoral heterogeneity of drug response. A) Schematic
  procedure of establishing SC‐PDCC clones from CRC patient. Colonies were generated
  after processing tissues (PDCC P0). Scale bar: 50 µm. Then cells were sorted using
  EPCAM+ to obtain single cell per well. Scale bar: 100 µm. SC‐PDCC clones were established
  after expansion. Scale bar: 50 µm. B) Representative bright field microscopy images
  of SC‐PDCC colonies and H&E images of SC‐PDCCs derived ALI organotypic cultures.
  Passage numbers were marked in brackets. Scale bar: 50 µm. C) Rhodamine staining
  showing that all SC‐PDCC clones of P62 are resistant to 10 × 10−6m PLX4720, but
  their responses to gefitinib are different. All PLX4720 resistant SC‐PDCC clones
  are sensitive to the combination of 10 × 10−6m PLX4720 and 10 × 10−6m gefitinib.
  Three technical replicates are performed for each clone. D) PCA showed that SC‐PDCC
  clones with different response to gefitinib are separated into two groups. E) GSEA
  showing the significantly enriched EGF response pathway in gefitinib sensitive SC‐PDCC
  clones.'
