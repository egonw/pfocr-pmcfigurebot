caption: Viral entry into target cells is initiated after attachment to the plasma
  membrane and is accomplished by macropinocytosis (1). During maturation of macropinocytic
  vesicles into LE/Lys, the viral envelope fuses with the LE/Lys membrane, and the
  NC is released into the cytosol (2), where it serves as a template for the primary
  transcription of capped viral mRNAs (3). Translation of viral proteins (4) occurs
  at free ribosomes, with the exception of GP, which is translated at the rough endoplasmatic
  reticulum (ER/RER). GP is transported through the classical secretory pathway via
  the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane. The matrix protein VP40 associates with
  membrane vesicles and is transported to the plasma membrane to form the viral envelope
  together with GP and cellular lipids (10). Expression of NC proteins (NP, VP35,
  VP30, VP24, and L) leads to the formation of IBs (5) where secondary transcription
  (6), genome replication (7), and NC assembly are organized (8). NCs are transported
  directionally from IBs to budding sites through actin polymerization-driven transport
  mediated by actin tail formation at one end (9). Envelopment of NCs by membranes
  containing VP40 and GP occurs at the plasma membrane where budding of filoviruses
  take place (11). Figure was created with BioRender.com. IB, inclusion body; LE/Lys,
