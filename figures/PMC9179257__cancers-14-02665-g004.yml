caption: The effects of FDLE on cell cycle arrest in non-inflammatory and inflammatory
  HCT-116 and HT-29 colorectal cancer cells by flow cytometry. (A–C) Representative
  cell cycle distribution of non-inflammatory HCT-116 and HT-29 cells treated with
  three doses (50, 100 and 200 µg/mL) of FDLE for 48 h. (D–F) Representative cell
  cycle distribution of inflammatory HCT-116 and HT-29 cells treated with three doses
  (50, 100 and 200 µg/mL) of FDLE for 48 h after adding a mixture of cytokines (TNF-α,
  IFN-γ and LPS each 10 ng/mL) for 2 h. The results were represented as mean ± SD
  of three independent experiments, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p
  < 0.0001.
