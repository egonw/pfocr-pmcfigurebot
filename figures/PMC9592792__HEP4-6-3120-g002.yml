caption: Summary of gene‐wise associations with liver attenuation. Each point corresponds
  to a single gene, with a gene‐wise p‐value on each axis (log scale) in either the
  African or European subgroups of Genetics of Liver Disease (GOLD). Filled circles
  represent credible genes, which are labeled with gene names. The bars represent
  the MAGENTA enrichment cutoff. ABCC2 (MRP2), ATP binding cassette subfamily C member
  2 (multidrug resistance‐associated protein 2); ABCG5 (ABCG5), ATP‐binding cassette
  (ABC) transporter G5; ABCG8 (ABCG8), ATP‐binding cassette (ABC) transporter G8;
  APOB (APOB), apolipoprotein B; FABP6 (ILBP), fatty acid binding protein 6 (ileal
  lipid‐binding protein); FETUB (FETUB), fetuin B; FOXO1 (FOXO1A), forkhead box O1;
  MTTP (MTP), microsomal triglyceride transfer protein; NR0B2 (SHP), nuclear receptor
  subfamily 0 group B member 2 (small heterodimer partner); NR1H4 (FXR), nuclear receptor
  subfamily 1 group H member 4; PPARA (PPAR), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor
  alpha; SLC4A2 (AE2), solute carrier family 4 member 2 (anion exchange protein 2).
article_title: Population‐based meta‐analysis and gene‐set enrichment identifies FXR/RXR
  pathway as common to fatty liver disease and serum lipids.
