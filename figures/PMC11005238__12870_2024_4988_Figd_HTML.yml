caption: Anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway of C. australasica reproduced with permission
  of Kanehisa Laboratories []. The main components in anthocyanin pathway are shown
  with red asterisks. Phenylalanine undergoes catalysis via a series of steps producing
  Cinnamic acid, Coumaric acid, 4-Coumaroyl-CoA, Naringenin chalcone, Naringenin,
  Dihydrokaempferol, Dihydroquercetin, Dihydromyricetin, Leucoanthocyanidins, Anthocyanidins,
  and Anthocyanins. The major types of anthocyanins identified from the annotation
  of C. australasica by KEGG analysis were pelargonidin, pelargonidin-3-sambubioside,
  cyanidin, cyanidin 3-glucoside, cyanidin 5-glucoside, cyanidin 3,5-diglucoside,
  cyanidin-3-sambubioside, delphinidin, delphidin-3-sambubioside, delphinidin 3-glucoside.
  The pathways were retrieved from KEGG pathway analysis
