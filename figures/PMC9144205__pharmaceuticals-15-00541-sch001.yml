caption: The synthetic pathway to generate naphthoquinone derivatives 9–16. Compounds
  9–16 are synthesized from the corresponding aromatic amines and 2,3-dichloronaphthoquinone
  [,,,,]. By using aryl urea in this reaction instead of an aromatic amine, we hoped
  to form an oxazole ring, but we failed to form 2-chloro-3-(phenylamino)-1,4-naphthoquinones
  9–15 or 2-(4-hydroxyphenylamino)-1,4-naphthoquinone 16.

  Naphthoquinone Derivatives as Promising Anticancer Candidates Targeting COX-2.
