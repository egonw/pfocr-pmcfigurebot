caption: 'Disruption of the catalytic subunit Tpk2 of PKA results in defective trap
  morphogenesis in A. oligospora. a) Domain description of PKA catalytic subunits
  TPK1 and TPK2 in A. oligospora. Positions of the protein kinase domain (PROSITE
  entry #PS50011) and AGC-kinase C-terminal domain (AGC; PROSITE entry #PS51285) in
  the Tpk1 and Tpk2 protein sequences were determined using ScanProsite. b) A neighbor-joining
  phylogenetic tree of PKA catalytic subunit protein sequences from A. oligospora
  and orthologs from model fungi. Ani: A. nidulans. Ao: A. oligospora. Mor: M. oryzae.
  Ncr: N. crassa. Sce: S. cerevisiae. Uma: U. maydis. c) Normalized transcripts per
  million (TPM) of TPK1 and TPK2 in a time-course transcriptomic analysis in response
  to C. elegans nematodes. d) Colony morphologies of wild-type (ku70), tpk2 mutant,
  and the tpk2 TPK2-complemented strain after 4 days at 25°C on PDA plates (5 cm diameter).
  e) Conidiation by mutant and complemented strains was recorded after culturing for
  4 days on PDA plates (scale bar, 200 μm). f) Trap induction of mutant and complemented
  strains. Trap formation was induced by adding 30 C. elegans nematodes to fungal
  cultures on LNM plates (2.5 cm), and images were taken 24 h after induction (scale
  bar, 200 μm). g) Close-up images of A. oligospora traps after 24 h of continuous
  nematode exposure. Vegetative hyphae and traps of A. oligospora were stained with
  SR2200, which specifically binds to fungal cell walls (scale bar, 20 μm). h) Nematode
  survival assay of mutant and complemented strains. Survival rate of nematodes for
  each timepoint was calculated by dividing the number of living nematodes by the
  total number of nematodes at timepoint zero.'
