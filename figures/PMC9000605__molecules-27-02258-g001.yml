caption: '(Adapted from []) Schematic Diagram (A): The biosynthesis pathway of several
  class I enterocins (lanthipeptides): (1) formation of preenterocin; (2) modification
  of preenterocin by LanB and LanC and translocation of preenterocin by LanT; (3)
  histidine protein kinase (HPK) senses the presence of enterocin and autophosphorylates;
  (4) the phosphoryl group (P) is transferred to the response regulator (RR); (5)
  the transcription of regulated genes is activated by RR; (6) mature enterocin is
  processed and released under the regulation of LanP, LanI and Lan EFG. Schematic
  Diagram (B): The biosynthesis pathway of class II enterocins: (1) formation of the
  preenterocin and prepeptide of the induction factor (IF); (2) the precursors are
  processed and translocated by the ABC transporter and then mature enterocin and
  IF are released; (3) HPK senses the presence of autophosphorylates and IF; (4) the
  phosphoryl group (P) is transferred to the response regulator (RR); (5) the transcription
  of regulated genes is activated by RR; (6) producer immunity is achieved.'
