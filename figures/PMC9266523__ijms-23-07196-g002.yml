caption: Identification of the eIF2α-ATF4 pathway target tissues in response to 18
  d of APAP treatment. (A) Visualization of bioluminescence by imaging several organs.
  CARE-LUC mice were fed the Crtl diet (Ctrl) or the APAP diet (APAP) for 18 d. After
  bioluminescence imaging, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, organs were
  rapidly excised and imaged, followed by snap-freezing of the organ for subsequent
  luciferase enzyme assay. (B) Luciferase activity measured in tissue extracts. Results
  are given as fold induction in APAP group relative to Ctrl group. The graphs show
  means ± S.E.M. of 6 mice. * p ≤ 0.05; ** p ≤ 0.01; *** p ≤ 0.001 compared to the
  respective Ctrl value, Student’s t-test.
