figure_title: Pathway analysis and disease association of DEGs in control (C) and
  palmitate treated (T), normal (N)-iPSCs, and obese (O)-iPSCs during in vitro hepatocyte
  differentiation
caption: A The number of genes up/downregulated in four comparison groups (O vs N
  in C and T iPSCs and T vs C in N-iPSCs and O-iPSCs with different p values and false
  discovery rate (FDR). B, C Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was performed on the list
  of genes significantly affected (p value ≤ 0.5) in comparison groups B O vs N in
  C and T-iPSCs and C T vs C in N and O-iPSCs on D0, D6, D13 and D17 of hepatic differentiation.
  D Disease/Function association analysis on the list of genes affected significantly
  (p value ≤ 0.5) in C and T, normal (N) and obese (O)-iPSCs on D17 of hepatocyte
  differentiation.
