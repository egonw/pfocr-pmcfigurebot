caption: 'In vivo stable transfection of hepatocytes with FGF19 leads to long term
  secretion of biologically active FGF19. A. Mouse model strategy based on hydrodynamic
  gene transfer (HGT). Empty vector expressing only dTomato («Control») are used as
  control. B. Cryosection of liver 6 months after HGT, showing stably transfected
  hepatocytes that express dTomato. Scale bar: 100 μm. C. qPCR quantification of FGF19
  mRNA in control and FGF19 transfected livers 6 months post injection. Plasmids combined
  with transposase used for HGT are indicated: control-dTomato («Ctl») and FGF19-dTomato
  («FGF19»). Data are presented as mean ± SD. Mann-Whitney test p-values are shown.
  D. Plasma levels of FGF19 detected by ELISA. The number of mice analyzed for each
  time point is indicated. Data are presented as mean ± SD, with statistical significance
  of Mann-Whitney test shown. E. qPCR quantification of mRNA expression of Cyp7a1
  and Cyp8b1, target genes of FGF19/FGFR4 pathway; Serum 7 α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one
  (C4) levels, serum biomarker of bile acid synthesis and biliary bile acids pool
  composition. All data are presented as mean ± SD. Unpaired Student''s t-test p-values
  and significance are shown unless for bile acids composition, for which two-way
  ANOVA test significance is shown. F. Body weight of control and FGF19 HGT mice at
  6 months (left panel). Food intake of control and FGF19 HGT mice first month following
  HGT (right panel). Data are presented as mean ± SD. Unpaired Student''s t-test p-values
  and significance are shown. G. HES staining of liver sections of control and FGF19
  HGT mice after 6 months, showing no visible alteration on liver morphology. ∗p ≤ 0.05,
  ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001. N.s: not significant. n. d: not detectable.'
