caption: Anti‐fibrotic drug testing on living myocardial slices (LMS) cultured under
  physiological and pathological mechanical load. (A) TGFβ activation pathway. (B)
  Fold change expression of 48 h cultured rat LMS (− SB431542 PL N = 4–5; − SB431542
  OL N = 4–5; +SB431542 PL N = 5; +SB431542 OL N = 4), TGF‐β with and without SB‐431542
  treatment of pro‐fibrotic genes FN1, COL3A1, pro‐inflammatory gene IL‐6, genes activated
  by mechanical stress, ROCK2 and FAK. (C–F) Effects of SB‐431542 on contractility
  parameters of 48 h cultured rat LMS (−SB431542 PL N = 7–8; −SB431542 OL N = 9; +SB431542
  PL N = 10; +SB431542 OL N = 7). (C) Contractility of LMS after 48 h culture determined
  by normalising the amplitude of force by the LMS cross‐sectional area. (D) Time
  (in seconds) required to reach peak amplitude of force. (E) Time (in seconds) for
  the amplitude to decay from maximum force to 50%. (F) Time (in seconds) for the
  amplitude to decay from maximum force to 90%. (G–H) Representative images and quantifications
  of rat LMS stained for Vimentin, Collagen I, α‐actinin and Hoechst after 48 h of
  culture with and without SB‐431542 (−SB431542 PL N = 4; −SB431542 OL N = 4; +SB431542
  PL N = 4; +SB431542 OL N = 4). P value was calculated using two‐way ANOVA with Bonferroni's
  multiple comparison. *, ** = P value <0.05 and 0.01, respectively. Data shown as
  mean ± SEM. SL, sarcomere length; TGF‐βR, transforming growth factor β receptor.
  PL, physiological load; OL, overload.
