caption: Multiple sclerosis (MS) pathophysiology includes chronic inflammation, blood–brain
  barrier (BBB) disruption, and the increased response to platelet agonists, leading
  to enhanced platelet activation and a predisposition towards pro-thrombotic phenotype
  and elevating the risk of cardiovascular disease []. In MS, platelets show increased
  expression of surface receptors, including P2RY12, CD40L, CD62P, and GPIIb/IIIa,
  which are essential for their activation. Once activated, platelets release molecules
  that trigger both pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic responses. The interaction
  between platelets, leukocytes, and endothelial cells, particularly through the CD40/CD40L
  and CD62P/P-selectin glycoprotein ligand (PSGL-1) pathways, exacerbates vascular
  impairment and activates the clotting cascade. The CD40/CD40L pathway, significant
  in autoimmune pathologies, enhances leukocyte adhesion and infiltration, leading
  to increased recruitment of immune cells to vascular injury sites [,,,]. Furthermore,
  the interaction between platelets and leukocytes intensifies vascular permeability
  involving platelet-derived microparticles (PMPs), platelet-activating factor (PAF),
  and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), disrupting endothelial junctions and promoting
  inflammation [,,,]. Figure—own elaboration using elements generated by DALL·E 3,
