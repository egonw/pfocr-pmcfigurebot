caption: 'Association between VDR SNPs and expression of genes downstream of the vitamin
  D-VDR pathway. The mRNA levels were quantified by qPCR and the values are expressed
  relative to the reference gene β-actin. (A) Relative mRNA Gpx gene expression in
  association with ApaI SNP (AA vs. AC/CC) in controls and HCV+ and cirrhotic patients.
  (B) Relative mRNA Gpx gene expression in association with BsmI SNP (AA vs. AG/GG)
  in controls and HCV+ and cirrhotic patients. (C) Relative mRNA PMCA gene expression
  in association with BsmI SNP (AA vs. AG/GG) in controls and HCV+ and cirrhotic patients.
  (D) Relative mRNA JMJD1A gene expression in association with BsmI SNP (AA vs. AG/GG)
  in controls and HCV+ and cirrhotic patients. (E) Relative mRNA PMCA gene expression
  in association with TaqI SNP (CC vs. CT/TT) in controls and HCV+ and cirrhotic patients.
  (F) Relative mRNA LSD2 gene expression in association with TaqI SNP (CC vs. CT/TT)
  in controls and HCV+ and cirrhotic patients. (G) Relative mRNA p27 gene expression
  in association with FokI SNP (CC vs. CT/TT) in controls and HCV+ and cirrhotic patients.
  Results are expressed as median with error bars (95% CI) and individual data points.
  Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare values between groups. p < 0.05: statistically
  significant difference.'
