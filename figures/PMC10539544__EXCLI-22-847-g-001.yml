figure_title: 'Graphical abstract. This schematic image indicates a possible involved
  pathway in the current study. Based on our analysis, low quantities of glucose mitigate
  glycolysis inhibitor and cause increased ROS. Also, GLUL repression down-regulates
  GST3M, a glutathione transferase. Therefore, ROS molecules accumulated and can harm
  the cells. As well as the Bax gene, a proapoptotic gene, up-regulates in the result
  of GLUL knockdown, possibly because of mTOR/ AKT pathway suppression (Т: inhibitory
  path, ↑: promoting path)'
