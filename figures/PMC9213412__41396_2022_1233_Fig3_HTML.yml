figure_title: Metabolic potential and gene expression in high-quality MAGs and medium-quality
  SAGs
caption: The identification number for each genome is noted above each column. An
  ‘X’ indicates the presence of a gene or pathway within the genome; ‘/’ indicates
  a partial pathway. A complete list of gene IDs and criteria used for denoting the
  presence of a complete or partial pathway is found in Tables S and S. The square
  root of transcripts per million reads (tpm) of metatranscriptome reads mapped to
  the genome is indicated by a color scale within each square. The summed tpm indicates
  the total tpm of reads mapped to the genome on a logarithmic scale. A corresponding
  table for medium-quality MAGs is located in Table S.
