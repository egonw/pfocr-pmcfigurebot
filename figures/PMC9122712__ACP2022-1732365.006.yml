caption: Overexpression of miR-585-3p inhibits the proliferation of OC tumor in vivo.
  (a) Overexpression of miR-585-3p inhibits the growth of OC tumor in vivo. (b) Overexpression
  of miR-585-3p restrains the growth of OC tumor volume in vivo. (c) Overexpression
  of miR-585-3p restrains the weight growth of OC tumor. (d) RT-qPCR was used to detect
  the relative expression level of miR-585-3p after OC cells were transfected with
  miR-585-3pmimic. (e) Overexpression of miR-585-3p inhibits FSCN1 mRNA expression.
  (f) Overexpression of miR-585-3p inhibits the expression of FSCN1 protein. (g) Overexpression
  of miR-585-3p inhibits the expression of p-ERK protein. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P
  < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001.
