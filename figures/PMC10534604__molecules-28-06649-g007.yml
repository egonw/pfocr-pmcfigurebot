caption: SS acts through class I HDAC-induced p53 acetylation. (A) IHC assessment
  of the effect of SS on Ki-67 expression levels in CRC cell nude mice subcutaneously
  transplanted with tumors. (B) Weightâ€“time curves were plotted based on the body
  weight of nude mice measured during SS administration. (C) Tumor appearance and
  mean weight of tumors in each drug group. (D) HE staining to detect the inhibitory
  effect of SS on subcutaneously transplanted tumors in CRC cell nude mice. (E) IHC
  detection of SS-induced apoptosis of tumor cells. (F) Western blot analysis of the
  effects of acetylation of H3K27, H3K18, H3K9 and H4 in CRC cell nude mice subcutaneously
  transplanted tumors in the blank group, 5-FU group (25 mg/kg), SS group (50 mg/kg),
  Ent group (25 mg/kg) and SS (50 mg/kg) + Ent (25 mg/kg) group. (G) Protein blot
  analysis to detect the protein expression of class I HDAC in SS, Ent and SS + Ent-treated
  CRC cells. (H) Western blot analysis of the expression levels of cleave Caspase-3
  and Bcl2 in SW620 cells 24 h after drug administration. (I) Western blot analysis
  of CDK2 and p21 expression levels in SW620 cells 24 h after drug administration
  in culture. All experiments were performed three times independently. * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001.
