caption: A brief scheme of the main inflammatory mechanisms in the development of
  insulin resistance. ROS, reactive oxygen species; TLR4, toll-like receptor 4; AGE,
  advanced glycation end-products; RAGE, AGE receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein
  (MAP) kinase; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; IL, interleukins; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant
  protein-1; JAK-STAT, Janus kinase signal transducers as well as activators of transcriptional
  signaling pathway; S6k, ribosomal protein S6 kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase
  signaling pathway; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB pathway; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin;
  IRS1, insulin receptor substrate 1; FFA, free fatty acids.
