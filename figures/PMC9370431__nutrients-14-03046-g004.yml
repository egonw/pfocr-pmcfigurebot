caption: 'A schematic overview of the main mechanisms of LJP against atherosclerosis.
  Endothelial dysfunction causes lipid retention in the intima, the induction of endothelial
  expression of adhesion molecules, and the secretion of chemotactic substances, promoting
  leukocyte recruitment, adhesion, and transmigration into the vessel wall in patients
  with atherosclerosis. VSMC migrates from the media into the intima after dedifferentiating
  from a contractile to a proliferating phenotype. LJP inhibits atherothrombosis by
  interrupting oxidative stress-related lipid peroxidation and the PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway, promoting cell growth, proliferation, and angiogenesis. It also regulates
  inflammatory and macrophage-related cytokines IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α. LJP treats
  atherosclerosis through its inhibitory action on the enhanced proliferation and
  migration of VSMC in atherosclerosis patients. ACC1: acetyl-CoA carboxylase; CAT:
  catalase; ICAM-1: intercellular adhesion molecule-1; IL: interleukin; LJP: Laminaria
  japonica; LOX-1: lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1; LPL: lipoprotein
  lipase; MAPKs: mitogen-activated protein kinases; MCP-1: monocyte chemoattractant
  proteins; (p-)ERK: (phosphorylated); PI3K/Akt: phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein
  kinase B; PPAR-γ: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors-γ; ROS: reactive oxygen
  species; SOD: superoxide dismutase; TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor-α; VCAM-1: vascular
  cell adhesion molecule-1; VSMC: vascular smooth muscle cells.'
