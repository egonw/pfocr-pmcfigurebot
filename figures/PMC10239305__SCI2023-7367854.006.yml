caption: SETD4 controlled cell quiescence by inhibiting the PI3K-mTOR pathway via
  H4K20me3 catalysis. Representative IF images of H4K20me3 (a) and HP1-α (b) in qLCSCs
  and A-qLCSCs derived from H1299 and H520 cell lines. DAPI, nuclear counterstaining.
  Scale bar, 50 μm. (c) Protein levels of H4K20me3 and HP1-α in qLCSCs and A-qLCSCs.
  H4 was used as an internal reference. n = 3. ∗p < 0.05. Representative IF images
  of H4K20me3 (d) and HP1-α (e) in A-qLCSCsSETD4 and A-qLCSCsGFP. DAPI, nuclear counterstaining.
  Scale bar, 50 μm. (f) Protein levels of H4K20me3 and HP1-α in A-qLCSCsSETD4 and
  A-qLCSCsGFP. H4 was used as an internal reference. ∗p < 0.05. (g) Protein levels
  of PTEN, mTOR, PI3K, and p-PI3K in A-qLCSCsSETD4 and A-qLCSCsGFP. GAPDH was used
  as an internal reference. GAPDH was used as an internal reference. ∗p < 0.05. Data
  are presented as the mean ± SD.
