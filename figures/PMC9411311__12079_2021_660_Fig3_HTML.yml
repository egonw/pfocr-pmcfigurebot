caption: Time-dependent effect of GM peptide on inhibition of TCR signaling. a Coomassie
  brilliant blue staining for equal loading of proteins. b Western blot analysis of
  phosphorylation status of signaling proteins involved in proximal T cell receptor
  signal transduction pathway in T cells incubated with GM peptide for different time
  points. When stimulated with CD3/CD28 antibody, there was an increase in phosphorylation
  of signaling molecules ( +) compared to unstimulated cells (-). Pre-incubation of
  the cells with GM peptide (500 µM) for a minimum of 4 h completely inhibited CD3/CD28-mediated
  phosphorylation of the signaling molecules
