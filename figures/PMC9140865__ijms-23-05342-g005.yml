caption: 'Pressure activates ERK1/2, and U0126 treatment leads to increased DNA damage
  in hepatocytes under pressure: (A) Western blots showing the protein levels of p-ERK1/2
  and ERK1/2 in hepatocytes treated with pressure for 48 h. Histogram showing the
  mean level of total ERK1/2 and ERK1/2 activation (p-ERK1/2/total ERK1/2); (B) Western
  blots show the protein levels of p-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, and Dicer in hepatocytes treated
  with U0126 (10 μM). Histogram shows mean level of Dicer expression from three independent
  experiments; (C) DNA damage in U0126-treated hepatocytes cultured for 48 h under
  different pressure levels (5, 20, 40 mmHg) was examined with the comet assay. OTM
  and tail DNA% were used to calculate the degree of DNA damage (scale bar, 200 µm).
  Data are expressed as the mean ± SD. n = 3, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.'
