caption: 'ASS1 is required for suppressing PGAM1‐mediated BC proliferation, invasion,
  migration, and EMT process in vitro. (A, B) ASS1 knockdown efficiencies detected
  by western blot (n = 3). (C, D) Proliferative abilities of ASS1‐knockdown shPGAM1‐BC
  cell lines detected by cell proliferation assays (n = 3). (E, F) Invasion and (G,
  H) migration abilities of ASS1‐knockdown shPGAM1‐BC cell lines detected by transwell
  invasion and wound healing assays, respectively (n = 5, scale bar: 100 μm (E, G,
  H), 50 μm (F)). (I, J) Protein levels of E‐cadherin, N‐cadherin, vimentin, Snail,
  and Slug in BC cells detected by western blot (n = 3). Data was analyzed by ANOVA
  (C, D) t‐test (E–H), and was shown as mean ± SD. ns, no statistically significant;
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ****P < 0.0001.'
