caption: Apigenin inhibits the activation of primary mouse spinal cord fibroblasts.
  After primary mouse spinal cord fibroblasts were stimulated by TGFβ and incubated
  with DMSO or apigenin, fibrosis‐related mRNA and protein expression were detected
  by (A–C) qRT‐PCR and (D) Western blotting. Quantitative analysis of α‐SMA and Fn
  protein expression is shown in (E, F). (* means p < 0.05; ** means p < 0.01; ***
  means p < 0.001, p values were calculated with one‐way anova, followed by Bonferroni's
  multiple comparison test. n = 3)
