caption: The mechanism graph of the regulatory network of miR-16 in human colon mucosal
  epithelial cell (NCM460). miR-16 targets TLR4 to suppress NF-κB p65 and the downstream
  XIST, resulting in accelerated cell proliferation and tight junction integrity maintenance
  and diminished inflammation and apoptosis. XIST, X-inactive specific transcript.
article_title: MicroRNA-16 inhibits the TLR4/NF-κB pathway and maintains tight junction
  integrity in irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea.
