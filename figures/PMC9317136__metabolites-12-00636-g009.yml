caption: Effect of MAP kinase inhibitors on the taurine-induced increase in TXNIP
  mRNA in Caco-2 cells. Caco-2 cells were pretreated with each of the three MAPK inhibitors
  for 2 h and then cultured in medium containing 100 mM of taurine and each inhibitor.
  After 48 h, RNA was extracted and used for real-time PCR. The results are expressed
  as relative values, with the control value without the inhibitor as 1. Each value
  is the mean ± S.E. (n = 3) and the abcd values indicated by different characters
  are significantly different from each other, and the abcd values indicated by the
  same characters are not significantly different (Tukey’s test; p < 0.05).
