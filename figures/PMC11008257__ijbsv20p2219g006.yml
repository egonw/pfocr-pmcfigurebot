caption: NUP85 disruption attenuates lipid accumulation and inflammation in FFA-treated
  AML-12 cells by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. A. Western blotting was
  used to detect the expression levels of PI3K and p-PI3K in AML-12 cells after transfected
  with CCR2-siRNA. B-C. Western blotting results of the proteins associated with PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathways were tested in AML-12 cells after transfected with NUP85-siRNA
  and pcDNA3.1-3×Flag-c-NUP85. D-E. Western blotting was used to detect the expression
  levels of related proteins in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway after transfected and
  co-cultured with LY294002. F-G. The protein expression levels of ACOX-1, PPAR-α,
  IL-6 and IL-1β were detected using Western blotting after transfected with NUP85-siRNA
  and pcDNA3.1-3× Flag-c-NUP85 and co-cultured with LY294002 for 8 h in AML-12 cells.
  H-I Secretion levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in culture medium. All experimental
  results of this study were replicated at least three times. **p<0.01, ***p<0.001
  compared with the control group.
