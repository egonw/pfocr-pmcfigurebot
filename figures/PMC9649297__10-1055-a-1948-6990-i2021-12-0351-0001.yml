caption: Drug candidates under study that target possible mechanisms of PPNAD. One
  of pathogenic mechanisms of PPNAD is that genetic events lead to structural activation
  of cAMP/PKA signal pathway, resulting in high glucocorticoid secretion independent
  of ACTH. The mTORC1 pathway was activated by PKA signaling. Rapamycin is a mTOR
  inhibitor that acts on the PKA/mTOR pathway. Activated PKA signal leads to FLACs
  cannot be clear out and then morbid hyperplasia of adrenal cortical. Celecoxib can
  effectively reduce the proliferation of adrenal cortical cells induced by FLACs
  and thereby reduce glucocorticoid production. There is an illicit serotonergic stimulatory
  loop associated with hypercortisolemia because of cAMP/PKA pathway activation in
  adrenal tissues. Tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitors can reduce the stimulatory effect
  of 5-HT. Somatostatin analogs can reduce intracellular cAMP production and thus
  may reduce cortisol secretion in PPNAD. PPNAD, Primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical
  disease; cAMP/PKA, cyclic adenosine monophosphate/protein kinase A; mTORC1, the
  mammalian target of Rapamycin sensitive complex 1; FLACs, Fetal-like adrenal cortical
  cells; 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine.
