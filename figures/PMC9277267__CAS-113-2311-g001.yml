caption: Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) deficiency downregulates genes in cell cycle
  and cell division pathways. A, Heat map showing the clustering of mRNA expression
  profiles of bulk RNA‐seq data from multiple diethylnitrosamine (DEN)–treated 12‐week‐old
  mice based on normalized mRNA expression level (fold change > 1.5, p < 0.05). B,
  Gene Ontology (GO) analysis performed with differentially expressed 341 genes in
  (A) using DAVID. Red arrows indicate GO pathway term used in (C). C, Selected GO
  pathway term gene network (red, upregulated genes; blue, downregulated genes). D‐E,
  Gene‐to‐gene networks between p53 and groups of identified genes from the Cell Division
  and Cell Cycle GO terms in (C). Node color represents the degree of fold change
  (Log2 FC), and node size indicates P value (–Log10 P value). F, Proliferating cell
  nuclear antigen (PCNA) staining and (G) TUNEL staining of multiple DEN–treated mice
  at 24 weeks old. T, tumor; black dotted line, separate tumor and normal tissues;
  red dotted line, region of the field magnified
