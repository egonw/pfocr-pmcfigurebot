caption: Ying Yang 1 (YY1) promoted prostate cancer (PCa) progression in vitro. (A)
  Efficiencies of YY1 inhibition and overexpression were examined by western blotting.
  (B–D) The effects of YY1 inhibition and overexpression on cell proliferation, detected
  by Cell Counting Kit‐8 (CCK‐8) (B), clone formation (C) and EdU assays (D). (E)
  The effects of YY1 overexpression on migration (above) and invasion (below) were
  observed in LNCaP by Transwell assays. (F, G) The effects of YY1 knockout on cellular
  migration (above) and invasion (below) observed in PC3 (F) and Du145 cells (G) by
  Transwell assays. *p < .05, **p < .01, ***p < .001.
article_title: Yin Yang 1 promotes the neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate
  cancer cells via the non‐canonical WNT pathway (FYN/STAT3).
