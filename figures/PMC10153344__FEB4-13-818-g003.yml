caption: Intracellular localization of CRF receptors in HeLa cells by means of laser
  scanning confocal microscopy and immunofluorescence. The presence of both CRF1 (A)
  and CRF2 (B) immunoreactivities was evident in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells. Omission
  of the primary antibody resulted in the lack of the immune signal (see also the
  methodical control of Fig. ). The scale bar (10 μm) in panel ‘A’ applies to both
  micrographs.
