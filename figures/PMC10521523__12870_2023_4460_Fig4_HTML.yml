caption: The metabolism of starch and sucrose in ‘Sopin’ and ‘Charging’ under dehydration
  treatment. (A) The starch and sucrose metabolic pathway based on the KEGG database
  (ko00500). In transcriptome analysis, enzymes upregulated in ‘Sopin’ are labeled
  with red boxes, enzymes downregulated in ‘Sopin’ are labeled with blue boxes, and
  the yellow box labeled enzymes are coded by genes that were both upregulated and
  downregulated in ‘Sopin’. (B) Relative expression levels of selected genes involved
  in starch and sucrose metabolism by RT-qPCR. *, P < 0.05 and **, P < 0.01 by Student’s
  t-test compared with gene expression levels in ‘Charging’. Data represent means ± SDs
  from three replicates. (C) The soluble sugar content. **, P < 0.01 by Student’s
  t-test compared with the content in ‘Charging’. Data represent means ± SDs from
  four replicates
