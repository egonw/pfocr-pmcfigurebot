caption: The bidirectional regulation of synaptic transmission mediated by signaling
  pathways of 5-HT receptors in the CNS. Different presynaptic and postsynaptic 5-HT
  receptors undergo excitatory and inhibitory synaptic changes. Three groups of G-protein
  coupled 5-HT receptors, including Gs/Gq/Gi-protein coupled groups, mainly mediate
  intracellular canonical cascades. 5-HT1/5 receptors coupled with Gi-protein downregulate
  synaptic excitability, while 5-HT4/6/7 receptors coupled with Gs-protein upregulate
  that by affecting the activity of AC and the downstream PKA signaling pathway. Both
  AC and PKA are critical for the presynaptic enhancement of glutamate release and
  the postsynaptic potentiation of AMPA receptors. 5-HT2 receptors coupled with Gq-protein
  can trigger the PKC signaling pathway that promotes the phosphorylation of NMDA
  receptors and neural hyperexcitation by producing Ca2+ inflows. At postsynaptic
  sites, 5-HT3 receptors, as the cation channels, can induce neural depolarization
  and open L-VGCC to increase intracellular Ca2+ concentrations which can also activate
  AC by binding CaM. The presynaptic expression of 5-HT1 autoreceptors can decrease
  presynaptic 5-HT release by directly inhibiting the activity of AC, closing Ca2+
  channels, or opening GIRKs to produce presynaptic depolarization. Taken together,
  5-HT receptors have bidirectional effects on the regulation of synaptic transmission.
