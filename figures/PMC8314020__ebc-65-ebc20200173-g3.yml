figure_title: Key emergent strategies for pathway balancing
caption: At the metabolite level (spheres), an unbalanced biosynthesis can lead to
  accumulation of toxic intermediates in native or synthetic biochemical networks.
  Sophisticated regulation and balancing of metabolic fluxes towards and from the
  toxic intermediate can support effective production of targeted end-products. (A)
  Dynamic control via a transcription regulator activates the reactions leading to
  the toxic intermediate strictly under the condition that its reaction partner (orange
  sphere) is available at sufficient concentrations for effective conversion into
  the desired product. (B) Tight transcription control can be achieved by CRISPR-interference.
  (C) Enzymes with enhanced activity facilitate effective conversion and synthesis
  of the desired end-product. (D) Synthetic scaffolds increase local concentrations
  of pathway enzymes for effective substrate-channelling with decreased diffusion
  of intermediates.
