caption: BMP signaling is upregulated in injury‐activated periosteum and muscle progenitors.
  (A) Experimental design of microarray analyses.() Tibia and adjacent skeletal muscle
  were harvested from uninjured hindlimbs at d2 and d7 post‐fracture and used for
  microarray analyses. (B) Representation of upregulated signaling pathways from Gene
  Ontology analyses between d2 versus uninjured (in orange, left) and between d7 versus
  d2 (in purple, right). (C) Heat map of BMP signaling components from microarray
  dataset. (D,E) Experimental design of scRNAseq of Prx1‐derived periosteal cells
  and skeletal muscle progenitors. Violin plot of BMP signaling pathway expression
  (left) and detailed visualization of receptor (Acvr1, Bmpr1a, Bmpr1b, Bmpr2), co‐factor
  (Smad1, Smad4, Smad5), and target (Id1) gene expression (right) in Prx1‐derived
  FCPs (D) and skeletal muscle FAP/MP (E). (F) Transverse section of d3 post‐fracture
  Prx1 Cre ;Rosa mTmG  hindlimb stained with PS showing activated periosteum (delimited
  by a black dotted line). High magnifications of boxed areas from adjacent section
  counterstained with DAPI show phosphoSMAD1/5/9 positive nuclei (white, pointed with
  yellow arrowhead) in GFP+ cells (in green) within periosteum (middle), and adjacent
  skeletal muscle (right). Scale bars: low magnification = 200 μm, high magnification
  = 50 μm. bm = bone‐marrow; d2 = day 2; PS = Picrosirius.
