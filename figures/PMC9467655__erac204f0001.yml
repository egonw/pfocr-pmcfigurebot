caption: Effects of TaMYB31 gene silencing on benzoxazinoid content. RNA and metabolites
  were extracted from the second leaves of wheat plants at 14 dpi BSMV-VIGS containing
  the TaMYB31 gene. (A) Expression of TaMYB31 by qRT–PCR using two reference genes
  Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPC) and Actin (ACT-1) (n=4). (B) Left
  panel, BXD metabolite levels presented as mg g–1 FW. Right panel, BXD metabolite
  levels in peak area from chromatogram (n=10–11). The comparison was made using Student’s
  t-test relative to BSMV::empty vector, P<0.05. Asterisks indicate a significant
  difference. In this figure, a single independent biological experiment is presented.
