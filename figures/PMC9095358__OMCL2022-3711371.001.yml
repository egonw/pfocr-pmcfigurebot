caption: 'Effects of dietary FAs on body weight, body fat, and food intake in mice.
  (a) Body weight. (b) Body fat ratio at the end of 26 weeks of feeding. (c) Food
  intake. (d) The areas under weight curve of different FAs were calculated for the
  period from 0 to 26 weeks (AUC0-26wk) and from 19 to 26 weeks (AUC19-26wk), respectively.
  The data are presented as the means ± SD, n = 15. ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01 versus
  the LD group; #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01 versus the SFA group; ^p < 0.05 and ^^p <
  0.01 versus the MUFA group.'
