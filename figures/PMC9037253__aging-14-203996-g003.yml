caption: Circ_6014 regulated the expression of miR-885-3p. (A) MiRNAs that have binding
  sites with circ_6014 according to two databases (miRanda and RNA hybrid). (B, C)
  The expression level of miR-885-3p increased (B) or decreased (C) with the down-
  or upregulation of circ_6014 expression. (D) The predicted wild-type binding sites
  and designed mutant-type binding sites of miR-885-3p and circ_6014. (E, F) Dual-luciferase
  reporter assays conducted in HEK293T and MDA-MB-231 cells with miR-885-3p and circ_6014
  suggested that miR-885-3p decreased the relative activity of luciferase reporters
  of the wild-type group. (G, H) Transfection of si-NC + miRNA-inhibitor-NC, si- circ_6014
  + inhibitor-miR-885-3p or OE-NC + miRNA-mimics-NC, or OE- circ_6014 + miR-885-3p
  and the absorbance of formazan solution at 490 nm showed that the decrease or increase
  in miR-885-3p could restrain the impact caused by down- or upregulating circ_6014
  expression. (I, J) Colony formation of both cell lines in six-well plates transfected
  with si-NC + miRNA-inhibitor-NC, si-circ_6014 + inhibitor-miR-885-3p or OE-NC +
  miRNA-mimics-NC, or OE-circ_6014 + miR-885-3p. (K, L) Columns used to compare the
  difference between cell counting numbers per area revealed that miR-885-3p could
  reverse the changes in biological function caused by circ_6014. *p < 0.05, **p <
  0.01, ***p < 0.001.
