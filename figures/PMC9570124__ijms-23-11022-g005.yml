caption: 'ADAMTS16 is upregulated in gastric cancer (GC) and is associated with a
  poor prognosis. (A) ADAMTS16 mRNA expression in advanced-stage GC tissue was higher
  than in early-stage GC tissue in TCGA. (B) GEPIA2 Kaplan–Meier plot of the effect
  of ADAMTS16 gene expression on GC patient survival. (C) Representative immunohistochemical
  staining image for ADAMTS16 protein expression level in GC. (D,E) Kaplan–Meier survival
  curves of GC patients on ADAMTS16 expression. Scale bar: 25 µm (C up), 50 µm (C
  down). The data are shown as means ± standard deviations. * p < 0.05, **** p < 0.0001.'
