figure_title: The O-GlcNAcylation process
caption: The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) starts from taking up glucose (Glc)
  and generates the high-energy end product UDP-GlcNAc by integrating molecules from
  multiple metabolic pathways. OGT transfers GlcNAc to Ser/Thr residues on substrate
  proteins, which can be removed by OGA. Inhibitors targeting GFAT, OGT and OGA, as
  well as genetic knockdown/knockout approaches are applied to perturbing the O-GlcNAc
  cycling process globally.
