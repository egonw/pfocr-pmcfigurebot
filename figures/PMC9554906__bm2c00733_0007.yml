caption: Effects of hybrid hydrogel components on metabolomics discrimination in HT-29.
  (A) PLS-DA diagram showing the discrimination in metabolite profile in HT-29 cells
  when they were cultured on HA-Tyr and G-Tyr hydrogels for 5 days. (B) Hierarchical
  clustering analysis obtained by altered metabolites in HT-29 cells that were cultured
  on HA-Tyr and G-Tyr hydrogels. (C) VIP score plot listing the top discriminated
  metabolites among groups. (D) Volcano scatter plot indicating the up/down-regulated
  metabolites as well as metabolites in similar level among groups. (E) Pathway impact
  graph representing the most significantly affected pathways in HT-29 cells when
  they were cultured on HA-Tyr and G-Tyr hydrogels. Data analyses have been conducted
  with MetaboAnalyst (n = 3, technical replicate = 3).
