caption: FA can promote NO generation through the PI3K/AKT/eNOS pathway. Compared
  with HVUEC, MOVAS control group and 400ng/ml+ L-N group, the NO production and eNOS
  protein expression of 200ng/ml and 400ng/ml FA were significantly increased, and
  the difference was statistically significant. In addition, the protein expression
  levels of eNOS, p-eNOS, PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT, and p-Akt were displayed after 200 ng/mL
  and 400 ng/mL FA treatments. The main statistical method used was Mann-Whitney U
  test after one-way ANOVA. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 vs. control group
