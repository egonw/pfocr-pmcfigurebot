caption: Expression of proteins of the mTOR signaling pathway with and without isoprenaline
  stimulation. WT and LMNA-KI mES cells were differentiated into cardiomyocytes and
  stimulated on day 12 with either isoprenaline (I) or isoprenaline together with
  rapamycin (R). (a) Western blot images of total and phosphorylated protein levels
  of mTOR, P70S6K, and 4EBP1. β-actin is used as a loading control. (b–d) Densitometric
  quantification of phosphorylated protein relative to total protein, measured by
  ImageJ program. One-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc analysis were used. Data are
  shown as mean ± SEM (n = 2–3). **** p < 0.0001, *** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.01, * p
  < 0.05. I = isoprenaline, R = rapamycin.
