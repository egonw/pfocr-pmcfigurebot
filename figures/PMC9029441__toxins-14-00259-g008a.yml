caption: 'The effects of 4-PBA alleviates CTN-induced liver injury. (A) Body weight,
  liver weight, and liver coefficient of mice. (B) Histomorphological observation
  of liver (blue arrows indicate hepatic cord disorder, red arrows indicate hepatocyte
  swelling, and green arrows indicate nuclear lysis. Scale bar: 50 and 20 μm). (C)
  Ultramicrostructure observation of liver tissue (red arrows indicate expansion of
  endoplasmic reticulum. Scale bar: 2 μm and 1 μm). (D). The activities of AST, ALT,
  and AST/ALT ratio were detected. The above data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Compared
  with the control group, ** p < 0.01.'
