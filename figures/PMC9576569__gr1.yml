caption: 'Lipid metabolic processes are the most commonly biological processes affected
  in mice quadriceps and liver during spaceflight(A) Cytoscape network of most common
  biological processes shared by the liver and the quadriceps reported by Gene Ontology
  biological Pathway (GOBP) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) in mice during spaceflight
  (p-value 0.05, FDR 0.05). Yellow circles indicate lipid metabolism related processes,
  pink circles indicate mitochondrial function related processes, green circles indicates
  protein post-translational processes, and the blue circle indicates a DNA Repair-related
  process.(B) Venn diagram of common KEGG GSEA pathways between the liver and the
  quadriceps in mice during spaceflight.(C) Summary of the common KEGG GSEA pathways
  between mice liver and quadriceps. FDR: False Discovery Rate, GOBP: Gene Ontology
  Biological Process, GSEA: Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes.'
article_title: Muscle atrophy phenotype gene expression during spaceflight is linked
  to a metabolic crosstalk in both the liver and the muscle in mice.
