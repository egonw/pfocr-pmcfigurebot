caption: Crosstalk Between RKIP and Laminin. RKIP inhibits the MEK/ERK signaling pathway
  by interrupting the interaction between Raf and MEK, stopping the progression of
  the signal through the pathway. C-Jun is regulated downstream of the MEK/ERK pathway.
  C-Jun binds to the promoter of Laminin-1, regulating the expression of Laminin-1.
