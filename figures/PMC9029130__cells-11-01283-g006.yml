caption: NAD+ exposure alters the PI3k-Akt signaling pathway. (A) ELISA results showing
  the increased level of ATP induced by NAD+ exposure compared to Ctrl group. Proliferating
  aNSPCs were cultured with 1 mM NAD+ supplemented for 48 h. Data are presented as
  the mean ± SEM. n = 3 independent experiments, unpaired t-test. (B) NAD+ exposure
  increased the levels of NADP+ and NADPH. Proliferating aNSPCs were cultured with
  1 mM NAD+ supplemented for 48 h. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. n = 3 independent
  experiments, unpaired t-test. (C) FPKM values of multiple genes relating to PI3k-Akt
  signaling pathway (proliferating condition). (D) FPKM values of multiple genes relating
  to PI3k-Akt signaling pathway (differentiation condition). (E) The relative mRNA
  levels of Pdgfrb, Epor, Erbb3 and Il2rb in aNSPCs treated with NAD+ (proliferating
  condition). Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. n = 3 independent experiments,
  unpaired t-test. (F) The relative mRNA levels of Pdgfrb, Epor, Erbb3, Il2rb in aNSPCs
  treated with NAD+ (differentiation condition). Data are presented as the mean ±
  SEM. n = 3 independent experiments, unpaired t-test. (G–I) Western blot assay and
  the quantification results show that NAD+ exposure significantly decreased the level
  of p-Akt (ser473) while the level of total Akt was not affected. GAPDH was used
  as an internal control. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. n = 3 independent
  experiments, unpaired t-test; *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001.
