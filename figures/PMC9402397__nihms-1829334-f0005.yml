figure_title: Tumor BIRC2 expression inhibits T cell recognition of tumor through
  negative regulation of IRF1-mediated upregulation of antigen presentation pathway
  genes
caption: (A) A375 melanoma cells were treated with IFN-γ (100 ng/mL) or TNF-α (100
  ng/mL) for 8 h, and western blot analysis was performed.(B) ESO T cells were co-cultured
  with A375 melanoma cells in the presence or absence of 5 μM LCL161 for 5 h along
  with brefeldin A and monensin, and T cell intracellular production of IFN-γ was
  measured by flow cytometry.(C) A375 melanoma cells transduced with Cas9 and non-targeting
  (NT) or BIRC2-targeting sgRNAs were co-cultured with ESO T cells for 5 h in the
  presence of brefeldin A and monensin, and T cell intracellular production of IFN-γ
  was measured by flow cytometry.(D) Volcano plot representing differentially expressed
  genes in A375 cells transduced with Cas9 and BIRC2 targeting sgRNA versus NT sgRNA.
  Expression of genes was analyzed by RNA-seq and abundance represented as relative
  fold change (x axis) versus significance (y axis).(E) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  of genes significantly upregulated in BIRC2-targeting sgRNA transduced A375 cells.(F)
  Ingenuity transcription factor (TF) analysis of genes significantly upregulated
  in BIRC2-targeting sgRNA-transduced A375 cells. TF activation Z scores are depicted
  on the x axis and the fold change in mRNA for each TF is shown on the y axis.(G)
  A375 cells were transduced with Cas9 and NT sgRNA or BIRC2-targeted sgRNAs, and
  western blot analysis was performed.(H) A375 cells were treated with vehicle or
  5 μM LCL161 for 16 h and western blot analysis was performed.(I) Heatmap of mRNA
  expression of differentially expressed genes in IRF1-related antigen presentation
  pathway () in A375 cells transduced with Cas9 and NT sgRNA or BIRC2-targeted sgRNAs.Data
  are representative of 3 independent experiments (A–C and G–H) or are pooled from
  a single experiment, with 3 biological replicates per group (D–F and I).Error bars
  depict standard deviation. Statistical significance was evaluated by 2-tailed Student’s
  t test. **p < 0.01.
