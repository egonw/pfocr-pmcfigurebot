caption: 'A: Whole-cell current responses of astrocytes in the SFO of WT and Nax-KO
  mice to ET-3. B: Relationship between current density and [ET-3] in 140 and 170
  mM NaCl solutions. C: Relationship between current density and [Na+]o in the presence
  or absence of 1 nM ET-3. D: ET-3 induction in the SFO in dehydration conditions.
  E: Immunocytochemical detection of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (P-ERK) in the SFO. Scale
  bars, 50 Âµm. F: Activation cascade of Nax via ETBR receptors. The pathway indicated
  by the dotted line was suggested not to function in Nax activation by ETBR signaling.
