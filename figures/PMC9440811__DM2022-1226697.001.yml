caption: ANTXR1 promotes erythroid cell proliferation and inhibits erythroid cell
  differentiation and apoptosis in K562 cells. (a) Western blot analysis was used
  to detect ANTXR1 (45 kDa) expression after transfection of K562 cells with ANTXR1
  overexpression vectors. (b) Quantification of western blots. (c) CCK8 proliferation
  assay of K562 cells at 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. (d) Flow cytometry detection
  of CD71 and CD235a expression in K562 erythroid differentiation. (e) Benzidine staining-positive
  cells. (f) Changes in the proportion of benzidine-positive cells. (g, h) Quantitative
  reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to determine
  the mRNA expression levels of GATA1 and ALAS2 in K562 erythrocytes induced by overexpression
  of ANTXR1. (i) Western blot analysis was used to detect GATA1 (45 kDa) and ALAS2
  (65 kDa) protein expression in K562 erythrocytes induced by overexpression of ANTXR1.
  (j, k) Quantification of western blots. Error bars represent standard deviation
  of three independent experiments. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01.
