caption: Pathways associated with metabolites affected by inflammatory diseases. Overview
  of top metabolite sets enriched in acute inflammation (A) and chronic inflammation
  (B) according to the MataboAnalyst analysis. The higher the dot in Enrichment Ratio,
  the more metabolites were present in a given pathway. (C) Network of pathways associated
  with inflammation-related metabolites (according to the Cytoscape analysis). AID—acute
  inflammatory diseases; CID—chronic inflammatory diseases.
