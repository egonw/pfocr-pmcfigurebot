caption: 'Prediction of the putrescine biosynthetic pathway by L. curvatus KP 3-4.
  (A) Known putrescine biosynthetic pathways in bacteria. The abbreviations used are
  as follows: AguA, agmatine deiminase; SpeB, agmatine ureohydrolase; NCPAH, N-carbamoylputrescine
  amidohydrolase; ODC, ornithine decarboxylase. (B) L. curvatus KP 3-4 was cultured
  in MRS or MRS with added arginine or ornithine anaerobically for 48 h at 37 °C and
  the amount of putrescine in the culture supernatant was analyzed by HPLC. Data represent
  means ± standard deviation from biological replicates (n = 3). Asterisks indicate
  statistical significance (** p < 0.01, Dunnett’s test with MRS as control). (C)
  Conservation analysis of polyamine synthesis and transport genes in lactic acid
  bacteria. The results shown are based on the tblastn analysis of the genome of the
  newly constructed L. curvatus KP 3-4 genome and genomes in the NCBI database (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi
  (accessed on 16 May 2021)). Contig information for L. curvatus JCM1091 was not available
  in the NCBI database, and it is shown by N/A. AdiA, arginine decarboxylase; AguA,
  Agmatine deiminase; AguB, (AguB is NCPAH, putrescine carbamoyltransferase is PtcA);
  NCPAH, N-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase; SpeA, arginine decarboxylase; SpeB,
  agmatinase; SpeC, ornithine decarboxylase; SpeF, ornithine decarboxylase; AguD,
  agmatine:putrescine antiporter; PlaP, putrescine importer; PotE, putrescine:ornithine
  antiporter; PotF, putrescine ABC transporter periplasmic binding protein; PotG,
  ATP binding protein of putrescine ABC transporter PotFGHI; PotH, permease of putrescine
  ABC transporter PotFGHI; PotI, permease of putrescine ABC transporter PotFGHI; PuuP,
  putrescine importer; SapB, transmembrane protein of putrescine exporter SapBCDF;
  SapC, transmembrane protein of putrescine exporter SapBCDF; SapD, ATP binding protein
  of putrescine exporter SapBCDF; SapF, ATP binding protein of putrescine exporter
  SapBCDF; AAT, agmatine aminopropyltransferase; APAUH, aminopropylagmatine ureohydrolase;
  CASDC, carboxyspermidine decarboxylase; CASDH, carboxyspermidine dehydrogenase;
  SpeD, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, proenzyme; SpeE, spermidine synthase;
  MdtI, multidrug efflux system transporter; MdtJ, multidrug efflux system transporter;
  PotA, ATP binding protein of spermidine/putrescine ABC transporter PotABCD; PotB,
  permease of spermidine/putrescine ABC transporter PotABCD; PotC, permease of spermidine/putrescine
  ABC transporter PotABCD; PotD, spermidine/putrescine ABC transporter. The color
  of each column indicates the score from the Protein BLAST analysis: (black) >500
  bits, (dark gray) 500–300 bits, (light gray) 300–100 bits, and (white) <100 bits,
  respectively.'
