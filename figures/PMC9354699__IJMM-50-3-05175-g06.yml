caption: KIR2.1 is involved in PDGF-BB-induced cell proliferation and migration. PDGF-BB
  activated the TGF-β1/SMAD2/3 signaling pathway and upregulated the expression of
  OPN and PCNA to promote cell proliferation and migration. ML133 inhibited KIR2.1
  channel activation and modulated the downstream TGF-β1/SMAD2/3 signaling pathway.
  The activation of the TGF-β1/SMAD2/3 signaling pathway was blocked by SB431542;
  however, the expression of KIR2.1 was not affected, indicating that KIR2.1 is located
  upstream of the TGF-β1/SMAD2/3 signaling pathway. PDGF-BB upregulated KIR2.1 protein
  expression, activated the KIR2.1 channel, and promoted K+ ion influx (red arrow)
  and cell membrane depolarization. Subsequently, the TGF-β1/SMAD2/3 signaling pathway
  was activated to regulate the proliferation and migration of pulmonary artery smooth
  muscle cells. KIR2.1, inwardly rectifying K+ channel 2.1; PDGF-BB, platelet-derived
  growth factor-BB; OPN, osteopontin; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen.
