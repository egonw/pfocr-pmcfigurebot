caption: Effect of L-anserine, L-carnosine, and ACCE on cellular tyrosinase activity.
  Inhibitory effect of ACCE (2.0 × 104 μg/mL), L-anserine (240 μg/mL or 1 mM), and
  L-carnosine (226 μg/mL or 1 mM) was measured against tyrosinase activity in the
  extract of MNT-1 cells. Histidine (155 μg/mL or 1 mM) was used as the negative control.
  Arbutin (272 μg/mL or 1 mM) was used as the positive control. Compared with the
  non-treated control, the p < 0.05 by Student’s t-test was defined by the star (*).
