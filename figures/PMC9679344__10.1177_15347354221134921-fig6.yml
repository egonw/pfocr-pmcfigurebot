caption: Regulatory effects of SZKJT on EMT-associated genes. The bar diagram shows
  the relative expression of vimentin (A), fibronectin (B), E-cadherin (C), and Oct-4
  (D) after 250 μg/mL SZKJT treatment in SAS cells, as determined by qPCR analysis.
  ***P < .001; **P < .01. Levels of the vimentin (E) and fibronectin (F) in SZKJT-treated
  SAS cells were determined by western blotting.
