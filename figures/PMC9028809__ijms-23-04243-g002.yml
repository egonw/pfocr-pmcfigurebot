caption: The NO signaling pathway, resulting in neuronal cell death during brain ischemia
  and reperfusion. During brain I/R, NMDAR forms a complex with nNOS through PSD95,
  resulting in nNOS activation and NO synthesis [,,,]. NO produced by nNOS activates
  c-Src through phosphorylation to inhibit the activity of NMDAR []. NO also phosphorylates
  downstream signaling molecules, including ASK, MLK3, and p38, which subsequently
  activates their downstream signaling proteins and finally stimulates the cell apoptosis
  pathway, resulting in cell death [,,,,]. NO activates CaMKII through S-nitrosylation,
  resulting in neuronal damage []. NMDAR, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor; nNOS, neuronal
  NOS; PSD95, postsynaptic density protein 95; ASK, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase;
  MLK3, mixed linage kinase 3; CaMKII, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II;
  MKK4/7, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4/7; JNK3, c-jun N-terminal kinase
