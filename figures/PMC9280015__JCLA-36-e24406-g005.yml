caption: 'LINC00941 promoted the migration and invasion of laryngocarcinoma cells.
  (A,B) The migration ability of SNU‐46 cells transfected with shLINC00941 vector
  or LINC00941 overexpression vector was determined by cell scratch assay (magnification:
  ×100; scale: 50 µm). (C,D) The migration ability of SNU‐899 cells transfected with
  shLINC00941 vector or LINC00941 overexpression vector was detected by cell scratch
  assay (magnification: ×100; scale: 50 µm). (E‐F) The invasion ability of SNU‐46
  cells transfected with shLINC00941 vector or LINC00941 overexpression vector was
  assessed by Transwell invasion assay (magnification: ×250; scale: 50 µm). (G‐H)
  The invasion ability of SNU‐899 cells transfected with shLINC00941 vector or LINC00941
  overexpression vector was determined by Transwell invasion assay (magnification:
