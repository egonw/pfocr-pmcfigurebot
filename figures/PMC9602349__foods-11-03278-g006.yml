  metabolism pathways and synthesis genes. IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; DMAPP, dimethylallyl
  pyrophosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate; GGPS, GGPP synthase; PSY, phytoene
  synthase; PDS, phytoene desaturase; Z-ISO, ζ-carotene isomerase; ZDS, ζ-carotene
  desaturase; CRTISO, carotenoid isomerase; LCYE, lycopene ε-cyclase; LCYB, lycopene
  β-cyclase; CHYB, β-carotene hydroxylase; LUT5, Lutein deficient 5; ZEP, zeaxanthin
  epoxidase; VDE, violaxanthin de-epoxidase; CCS, capsanthin–capsorubin synthase;
  NXS, neoxanthin synthase; NCED, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase. (B) Flavonoid
  metabolism pathways and synthesis genes. PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; C4H,
  cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase; ACC1, acetyl-CoA carboxylase
  1; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase;
  F3′H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin
  synthase; UFGT, flavonoid-3-O-glucosyltransferase; FNS, flavone synthase; FLS, flavonol
  synthase; LAR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase; ANR, anthocyanidin reductase. The pathway
  is constructed based on KEGG pathway and references. Heat maps of gene expression
  levels based on FPKM values.
