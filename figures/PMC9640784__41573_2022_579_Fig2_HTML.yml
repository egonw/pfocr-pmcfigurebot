figure_title: Select mechanisms of HER2-targeted resistance
caption: a, Mutations and/or alterations in the HER family of receptors that lead
  to activation of downstream signalling pathways. (1) Mutations in HER2 leading to
  P13K–AKT and RAS–MAPK pathway activation. (2) Co-occuring mutations in HER2 and
  HER3 leading to PI3K–AKT pathway activation. b, Loss of HER2 extracellular domain
  in cells overexpressing p95HER2 receptor. Masking of the trastuzumab-binding site
  on HER2 owing to overexpression of mucin 4 (MUC4) and CD44–polymeric hyaluronan
  complex. (3) p95HER2 overexpression. (4) MUC4 overexpression and CD44–polymeric
  hyaluronan complex. c, Activation of compensatory pathways. (5) Mutations in HER2
  promote MEK–ERK signalling, which activates CDK2 kinase. (6) PIK3CA mutations lead
  to P13K–AKT pathway activation. (7) Cyclin D1 gene overexpression leads to resistance
  to anti-HER2 therapies. d, Heterogeneous expression of the HER2 receptor in tumours
  leads to decreased sensitivity to HER2-targeted therapies that are dependent on
  overexpression of HER2. ER, oestrogen receptor.
