caption: UPR Signaling in ERα+ BC. In ERα+ BC cells, ERα can open IP3R calcium channels
  through PLCγ activity and then induce rapid anticipatory activation of the UPR.
  The IRE1α-XBP1s pathway is activated to reestablish ER homeostasis. PERK-eIF2α-ATF4
  can be activated to induce expression of apoptosis genes, such as CHOP. PERK can
  also be activated to promote apoptosis through TNFα expression promoted by NF-κB.
  The drugs targeting ERS-associated signaling pathways in ER+ BC are listed. Red
  represents pathway inhibitors and green represents pathway activators
