caption: Intracellular distribution of phospho‐ERK1/2 in HeLa cells by means of immunofluorescence
  and laser scanning confocal microscopy. (A) barely detectable phospho‐ERK1/2 signal
  in the cytoplasm of untreated HeLa cells. (B) Elevated pERK1/2 signal (red) 15 min
  after the start of hUCN1 treatment, predominantly in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells.
  (C) Weaker cytoplasmic pERK1/2 signal in the presence of 10 nm hUCN1 for 24 h. (D)
  Methodical control prepared by the omission of the primary antibody showed no noticeable
  immune signal at the applied microscope settings. The scale bar (10 μm) in Panel
  (A) applies to all micrographs. Nuclei were counterstained using Hoechst 33342 (Calbiochem,
  La Jolla, CA, USA).
