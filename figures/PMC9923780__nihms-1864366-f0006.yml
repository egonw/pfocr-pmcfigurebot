figure_title: Expression of DLL3 alters NOTCH1 protein levels and signal sending activity
  in cells that also express DLL1
caption: (A) Cell lines were produced in HEK293 Flp-in TRex cells that express endogenous
  NOTCH1, stable DLL1-Cerulean, and Doxycycline inducible DLL3-HA. Western blot analysis
  confirms expected expression patterns in the parental cell line and two independent
  DLL1/DLL3 cell lines. The levels of NOTCH1(p120) are reduced when DLL3 is induced
  in the DLL1/DLL3 cell lines. (B) Luciferase co-culture assays were performed using
  HEX293 TREx parental cells or a cell line with inducible DLL3 and stable DLL1 expression
  as signal sending cells and NIH3T3 cells transfected with NOTCH1, a Notch-responsive
  Luciferase reporter and a Renilla transfection control as signal receiving cells.
  Doxycycline was added to induce DLL3 expression, and an LFNG-HA expression vector
  was introduced into signal sending cells by transient transfection as indicated.
  Fold activation of luciferase by DLL1/DLL3 cells compared to parental HEK TRex cells
  was calculated after normalization to Renilla expression. Despite robust expression
  of DLL1, DLL1/DLL3 cells do not induce significant Notch pathway activity in receiving
  cells. Induction of DLL3 in these cells significantly increases their signal-sending
  ability approximately 3 fold. Expression of LFNG abrogates this effect. In A and
  B, separate blots were used to quantify DLL1-Cer, NOTCH1 (p120) and DLL3-HA or LFNG-HA.
  Tubulin signals for each representative gel are shown beneath the experimental panel
  and these tubulin values were used for normalization (n=4). (C,D) Cell lines with
  inducible DLL3 (iDLL3) or inducible DLL3 and stable DLL1 (iDLL3/DLL1) were grown
  in the presence or absence of doxycycline and with or without transfection of an
  LFNG-HA expression vector. Levels of NOTCH1(p120) are significantly reduced in DLL3
  expressing cells only if they also express DLL1, and this is confirmed by quantification
  of multiple biologically independent experiments (n=7 for all conditions except
  n= 6 +DLL1 and DLL3 and LFNG, where one value was excluded due to a gel abnormality).
  (E,F) iDLL3/DLL1 cells were grown in the presence or absence of doxycycline and
  the levels of NOTCH1(p300) and NOTCH1(p120) were assessed. By western blot quantification,
  NOTCH1(p120) is significantly reduced in the presence of DLL3, while the levels
  of NOTCH1(p300) are unaffected (n=3). (G,H) iDLL3/DLL1 cells were grown in the presence
  or absence of doxycycline (to induce DLL3 expression) and in the presence or absence
  of DAPT (to block Notch activation) and the levels of NOTCH1(p120) were assessed.
  By western blot quantification, NOTCH1(p120) is significantly reduced in the presence
  of DLL3, and this effect is abrogated in the presence of DAPT (n=3). Statistical
  analysis throughout included one way ANOVA followed by Tukey post-hoc with p<0.05
  indicating significance (*). Each symbol represents an independent experiment, and
  NOTCH(p120) values were set to one for each cell line in the “- Doxycycline” condition
  for comparison across blots. (I) Immunofluorescence on unpermeabilized cells was
  used to assess cell surface presentation of DLL1. Parental cells (HEK TRex, panel
  a) or iDLL3/DLL1 cells grown in the absence (panel b) or presence (panel c) of doxycycline
  were incubated with DLL1 antibodies specific to the DLL1-ECD. Cell surface DLL1
  signal is brighter in isolated cells that co-express DLL1 and DLL3. Brightness levels
  in panels a and b were increased to demonstrate background fluorescence levels.
  (J) Fluorescence levels were quantified in isolated cells (to reduce concerns about
  ligand internalization after signaling) and show that cell-surface levels of DLL1
  are significantly higher in cells that co-express DLL1 and DLL3. Each symbol represents
  an individual cell (n= 38 HEK TRex parental cells, n=35 iDLL3/DLL1 cells without
  doxycycline, n=24 iDLL3/DLL1 cells with doxycycline), and the mean value +/− SD
  is shown.
