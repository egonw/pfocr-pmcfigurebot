figure_title: A schematic diagram of the proposed divergent effects of astrocyte-specific
  Cp knockout on learning and memory function
caption: Astrocyte-specific Cp knockout blocks iron influx FPN1-CP pathway into the
  brain, leading to iron deficiency, decreased ferritin in neurons and oligodendrocytes,
  and increased iron levels in BMVECs of CpGfapcKO mice. Moreover, HP expression of
  neurons was up-regulated, enhancing the iron export from neurons and the iron deficiency
  of neuron. In young (6 M) CpGfapcKO mice, Iron deficiency can lead to abnormal adult
  hippocampal neurogenesis, synaptic formation, myelination and decreased 5-HT and
  NE synthesis. Finally, learning and memory dysfunction come into being. While in
  old (18 M) CpGfapcKO mice, iron accumulation with aging is attenuated. Thus, the
  level of oxidative stress is decreased, the MAPK (Erk/p38 phosphorylation, p-p38
  and p-Erk) signaling activation is altered and the level of apoptosis is diminished.
  Besides, AD-like pathologies such as Aβ aggregation and Tau phosphorylation are
  also decreased, which may result from down-regulated iron contents. The decreased
  oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and hallmarks of AD may make the abilities of
  learning and memory improved at the old age.
