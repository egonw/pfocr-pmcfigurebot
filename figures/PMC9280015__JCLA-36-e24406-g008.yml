caption: LINC00941 activated the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in laryngocarcinoma
  cells. (A‐E) The expressions of p‐PI3K, PI3K, p‐AKT, AKT, p‐mTOR and mTOR in SNU‐46
  cells transfected with shLINC00941 vector or LINC00941 overexpression vector were
  measured by western blot assay. (F‐J ) The expressions of p‐PI3K, PI3K, p‐AKT, AKT,
  p‐mTOR and mTOR in SNU‐899 cells transfected with shLINC00941 vector or LINC00941
  overexpression vector were detected by western blot assay. GAPDH served as an inner
  reference in western blot assay. **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001, vs. Empty vector. (GAPDH,
  glyceraldehyde 3‐phosphate dehydrogenase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PI3K,
  phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinase; shLINC00941, short hairpin RNA vector for LINC00941)
article_title: LINC00941 promoted in vitro progression and glycolysis of laryngocarcinoma
  by upregulating PKM via activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
