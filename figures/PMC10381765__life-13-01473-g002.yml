caption: 'Metabolic dysregulation in T2DM will contribute to greater platelet hyperreactivity.
  Dysregulated metabolic conditions in patients with T2DM will result in: (1) lower
  production of NO and PGI2; (2) reduced inhibition of the P2Y12 pathway; (3) increased
  oxidative stress and intracellular Ca2+signaling activate the PKC pathway; (4) decreased
  production of antioxidants; (5) increased protein glycation on the platelet surface;
  (6)Â enhanced surface expression of glycoproteins, such as GPIb and GPIIb/IIIa. Together,
  these factors contribute to a prothrombotic environment, thus promoting the development
  of vascular occlusion and atherothrombosis in T2DM.'

  2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and Atherosclerosis, Making It a Potential Target for
