caption: Overexpression of PLAGL2 reverses the effects of GATA5 in PCa cell lines.
  (A) The PLAGL2 overexpression cell line was constructed. (B–F) PLAGL2 overexpression
  could alleviate the inhibitory effect of GATA5 on cell proliferation. (G–J) The
  migration and invasion ability of cells were partially restored after overexpression
  of PLAGL2. (K) PLAGL2 overexpression had the opposite function on the FAK/PI3K/AKT
  pathway compared with GATA5. Data are presented as mean ± SD of at least three experiments.
  * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01.
