caption: 'Quercetin induced early upregulation of IGF-1R and promoted myogenic differentiation
  and protein synthesis downstream via the IGF-1R signaling pathway. C2C12 cells were
  grown to 80% confluency density in a 24-well plate. The cells were untreated or
  treated with quercetin (0, 12.5 µM) and cultured in DMEM medium containing 2% horse
  serum to promote cell differentiation for 7 days. Western blot analysis was used
  to study the expression of proteins related to IGF-1R and AKT signaling, with GAPDH
  used as internal control. (A) Western blot images of phosphorylated IGF-1R and IGF-1R.
  (B) Bar graphs show quantified relative protein expressions. (C) Western blot shows
  analysis of protein expression of p-STAT3 and STAT3. (D) Bar graphs show quantified
  relative expressions. (E,F) Western blot images and quantification level protein
  related to the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. (G,H) Western blot images and quantification
  level protein related to AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin. Data are expressed as mean ± SD based
  on three independent biological repeats (n = 3), * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001 indicate
  a significant difference between the control group and quercetin-treated group.
