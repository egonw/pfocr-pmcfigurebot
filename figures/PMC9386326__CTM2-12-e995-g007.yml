caption: UDP‐GlcUA stabilizes TGFβR1 mRNA and activates TGFβ/Smad signalling. (A–C)
  qRT‐PCR analysis of TGFβ/Smad pathway‐related genes (n = 3). (D–F) The expression
  of TGF‐β/Smad pathway‐related proteins by immunoblot. (G and H) TGFβR1 mRNA half‐life
  in Huh7 and SNU449 cells supplemented with or without UDP‐GlcUA for 30 min before
  treated with DRB (50 μM) for indicated times (n = 3 independent experiments). DRB,
  5,6‐dichloro‐1‐beta‐ribo‐furanosyl benzimidazole. (I) RNA Immunoprecipitation (RIP)‐qPCR
  showing the binding of PTBP3 to the TGFβR1 in Huh7 cells supplemented with or without
  UDP‐GlcUA. IgG served as a negative control. (J–M) mRNA (J and K) and protein (L
  and M) expression levels of TGFβR1 in PTBP3‐depleted Huh7 and SNU449 cells after
  0.5 h of UDP‐GlcUA treatment. (N and O) mRNA half‐life of TGFβR1 in PTBP3‐depletion
  Huh7 (N) and SNU449 (O) cells after 0.5 h of UDP‐GlcUA treatment. Data are mean ± SD.
  p‐Values were derived from an unpaired, two‐tailed Student's t‐test in (A–C), (G–I),
  (N–O) and one‐way ANOVA  followed by the Tukey test in (J and K) (*p < .01, **p
  < .01, ***p < .001).
