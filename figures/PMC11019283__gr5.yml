caption: Pien Tze Huang (PZH) inhibits the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)
  and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) by regulating the signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-A20 signalling pathway. (A) PZH (1.25 mg/mL)
  significantly increased the protein expression of phospho-STAT3 (p-STAT3) and A20
  in peritoneal macrophages and THP-1 cells treated with or without lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) (100 ng/mL). (B) Cells were pretreated with Stattic (20 μM) for 30 min and
  treated with PZH (1.25 mg/mL) for 2 h followed by incubation with LPS (100 ng/mL)
  for 40 min. Stattic treatment decreased the protein expression of p-STAT3 and A20
  and increased the protein expression of phospho-p65 (p-p65), phospho-extracellular
  signal-regulated kinases (p-ERK), and phospho-C-Jun N-terminal kinases (p-JNK) in
  peritoneal macrophages and THP-1 cells treated with PZH and LPS. (C) Cells were
  pretreated with Stattic (20 μM) for 30 min and treated with PZH (1.25 mg/mL) for
  2 h followed by incubation with LPS (100 ng/mL) for 6 h. Stattic treatment increased
  the mRNA levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and IL-1β
  in peritoneal macrophages and THP-1 cells treated with PZH and LPS. The results
  are representative of one of three experiments. The data are shown as the mean ± standard
  deviation (SD). ∗∗∗P < 0.001, based on one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
