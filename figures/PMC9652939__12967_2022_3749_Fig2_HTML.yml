caption: MICAL1 promoted PC cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis in vitro.
  A–C Cell proliferation of PANC-1 and SW1990 cells with MICAL1 stable overexpression
  and MICAL1 stable silencing were determined by CCK-8 (A), colony formation (B) and
  EdU (C) assays. D, E Cell metastasis and invasion of indicated PC cells were determined
  by wound healing (D) and Transwell (E) assays. Data represent mean ± SD of three
  independent experiments and were analyzed by two-sided unpaired Student’s t-test,
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01
article_title: MICAL1 facilitates pancreatic cancer proliferation, migration, and
  invasion by activating WNT/β-catenin pathway.
