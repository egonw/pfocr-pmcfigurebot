caption: The “Glutathione Pathway.” Glutathione synthesis, γ-glutamyl pathway, cellular
  distribution, antioxidant properties, catabolism of xenobiotics, and glutathione
  recycling in the cell. The figure shows a schematic representation of the “glutathione
  pathway.” Glutathione (GSH) is synthesized from glutamate, cysteine, and glycine
  by γ-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase (glutamate cysteine ligase) and glutathione synthetase.
  Glutathione redox state is regulated, in part, by glutathione peroxidases, forming
  oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and by a reaction catalyzed by glutathione reductase.
  Glutathione is conjugated to substrates both through the action of the glutathione
  S-transferases and through non-enzymatic reactions. Glutathione conjugates can be
  excreted from the cells by members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter
  family.
