figure_title: Maps showing the role of the TGF-β signaling pathway in the dialog between
  cancer cells and the TME
caption: 'a Radar chart from CellChat data showing the major signaling pathways that
  mediate cell-to-cell interactions in LUAD. b TGF-β signaling pathway interactions
  between cancer cells and nine specific cell types of the TME from scRNA-seq data.
  The maps show TGF-β pathway interactions between cancer cells and cells of the immune
  microenvironment in AIS (left panel), MIA (middle panel), and IAC (right panel).
  c Heatmaps showing the distributions of ligands and receptors in the TGF-β pathway
  in the three stages of LUAD (upper: AIS, middle: MIA, lower: IAC). d GSVA of scRNA-seq
  showing that differences in the expression of genes (54 genes) downstream of the
  TGF-β pathway between normal cells and cancer cells differed among the three stages
  of LUAD. e TMAs were used to verify the expression of a gene related to TGF-β phosphorylation
  (p-Smad2) in the three stages of LUAD.'
