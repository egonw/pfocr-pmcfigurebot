figure_title: G6PD is not essential for human mesothelioma survival in vitro and in
  vivo
caption: 'A. CRISPR technique was used to knockout G6PD in NCI-H226 and MSTO-211H
  cells. Cells were selected with puromycin to generate stable cell lines and analyzed
  by Western blotting for G6PD. KO1 and KO2 are the cell lines transduced with the
  G6PD sgRNA1 and G6PD sgRNA2, respectively, as described in the method section. B.
  Scramble and G6PD-knockout human mesothelioma cells were cultured for 24h and analyzed
  by MTS for proliferation. C. Scramble and G6PD-knockout human mesothelioma cells
  were injected into athymic mice to establish xenografts. The tumor volume kinetics
  were calculated and are presented at the bottom panel. Cycle: Mean, Bar: SD. D.
  Scramble and G6PD-knockout human mesothelioma cells were treated by AG1 and analyzed
  by flow cytometry for Annexin V and PI staining. The percentage of Annexin V+PI+
  cells are quantified and presented at the right. Shown are results of one of two
  experiments. Column: Mean, Bar: SD.'
