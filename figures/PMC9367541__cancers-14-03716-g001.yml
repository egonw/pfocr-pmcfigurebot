caption: 'Mutations in the TCR signaling pathway. Mutations of TCR signaling-related
  genes in PTCL. The intracellular pathways after TCR ligation and costimulatory activation
  were reconstructed from published studies. From left to right: (1) PI3K pathway
  after CD28/TCR-dependent FYN phosphorylation and ultimately resulting in activation
  of mTOR and NF-κB pathways; (2) AP-1/MAPK pathway that comprises MALT1-induced JNK
  activation, and PLCγ1-GRB2/SOS–induced MAPK activation; (3) NF-κB/NFAT pathway proximally
  initiated by ITK-dependent PLCγ1 activation; and (4) GTPase-dependent pathway, including
  RHOA, responsible for cytoskeleton remodeling upon costimulatory/TCR activation.
  Asterisks indicate mutations affecting the respective molecules.'
