caption: MOBT inhibited lncITPF transcription via reducing Smad2/3 phosphorylation.
  (A) The Western blot analysis displayed that TGF-β1 increased the expression of
  collagen I, vimentin, and α-SMA, whereas MOBT decreased their expression. (B) qRT-PCR
  was used to discover the lncITPF expression level in the normal, TGF-β1, and MOBT
  + TGF-β1 groups. The results demonstrated that TGF-β1 increased the lncITPF expression,
  whereas MOBT caused a reduction. (C) The xCELLigence real-time cell analysis (RTCA)
  system was used to analyze the proliferation of MRC-5 cells. Overexpression of lncITPF
  increased the proliferation of activated fibroblasts, similar to the TGF-β1 effect.
  MOBT reduced the proliferation of activated fibroblasts compared with the TGF-β1-treated
  group. (D) The RTCA system was used to assay the migration of MRC-5 cells. Overexpression
  of lncITPF increased the migration of activated fibroblasts, similar to the TGF-β1
  effect. MOBT reduced the migration of activated fibroblasts compared with the TGF-β1-treated
  group. (E) Single-molecule RNA-FISH revealed that the lncITPF (red) was mostly located
  in the nucleus. MOBT treatment reduced the lncITPF expression and did not lead to
  its translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. 18S RNAs were used as cytoplasmic
  localization markers. U6s were used as nuclear localization markers. DAPI was used
  for the staining of fixed cell DNA (blue). (F) The Western blot analysis demonstrated
  that MOBT inhibited Smad2/3 and p-Smad2/3 expression. (G) ChIP-PCR was used to evaluate
  the binding of Smad2/3 in the lncITPF promoter region under MOBT treatment. The
  results reflected that MOBT decreased Smad2/3 protein enrichment in the lncITPF
  promoter. (H) Actinomycin D rapidly decreased the expression of lncITPF, and the
  half-life of lncITPF was approximately 50 min. The combination of actinomycin D
  and TGF-β1 increased the half-life of lncITPF (120 min). Meanwhile, the combination
  of actinomycin D, TGF-β1, and MOBT decreased the half-life of lncITPF (105 min).
