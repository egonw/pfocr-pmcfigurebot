caption: 'Tranilast reduces LPS-induced reduced viability in the BEAS-2B cells. The
  viability of the BEAS-2B cells treated with (A) different concentrations of tranilast
  and (B) different concentrations of tranilast then stimulated with LPS was detected
  using Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. ***P<0.001 vs. control; #P<0.05 vs. LPS. LPS, lipopolysaccharide.'
