caption: 'SIRT4 protects BMECs from heat stress-induced cell damage through the AMPK/mTOR
  signaling pathway. (A,B) Expression of SIRT4 alleviated heat stress-induced decrease
  in mitochondrial membrane potential in BMECs. (C–E) The aberrant contents of ATP,
  ADP, and AMP were restored after expression of SIRT4 in BMECs. (F–H) AMPK/mTOR signaling
  pathway involved in the protective effect of SIRT4 in heat stress-induced damage
  of BMECs. NC: negative control; Mock: expression of control vector. These results
  are presented as the mean ± SEM from three independent experiments. ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001.'
