caption: Screening β-carotene ketolase (CrtW) and hydroxylase (CrtZ) from diverse
  organisms. (A) The biosynthetic pathway from β-carotene to astaxanthin. (B) Comparing
  the efficiency of different CrtWs in converting β-carotene to echinenone and canthaxanthin.
  (C) Comparing the efficiency of different CrtZs in converting β-carotene to β-cryptoxanthin
  and zeaxanthin (β-cryptoxanthin not detected). Evolutionary trees are constructed
  by maximum likelihood method, the percentage of trees in which the associated taxa
  clustered together is shown above the branches. Blue circle, bacteria. Green circle,
  algae. Error bar represents standard deviation of triplicate experiments.
