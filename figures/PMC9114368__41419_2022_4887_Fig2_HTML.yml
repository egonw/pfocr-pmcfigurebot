figure_title: CircLIFR inhibits the progression of HCC cells in vitro
caption: A qRT-PCR analysis of the circLIFR expression in five HCC cell lines. B,
  C Cell counting kit-8 assays to show the effect of circLIFR on cell proliferation
  in Huh7 and SNU387 cells. D, E Effect of circLIFR overexpression or knockdown on
  Huh7 and SNU387 cells examined by colony formation assay. F, G The cell migration
  and invasion ability, examined by Transwell assays, after overexpression of circLIFR
  in Huh7 cells and knockdown of circLIFR in SNU387 cells. The scale bars are 100 μm.
  Data represent means ± SD of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05.

  miR-624-5p and inactivating the GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway.
