figure_title: The miR-125b-5p-Bcl-2-ROCK signaling pathway is involved in erythroblast
  enucleation
caption: Mitochondrial depolarization was determined by JC-1 staining and the ratio
  of the fluorescence intensity at 595 nm/525 nm in erythropoiesis of hCB-MNC-derived
  erythroblasts (A) and K562 cells (B) Representative images of flow cytometry analysis
  and statistical analysis of JC-1 staining are presented in the left and right panels,
  respectively. Statistical analysis of data from independent experiments is presented
  as the mean ± SD (A, p = 0.0054 (n = 6); and B, p = 0.0051 (n = 3)). C Representative
  images of western blots show caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-3 levels in miR-125b-5p-overexpressing/control
  K562 erythroid cells before and after erythroid differentiation. Cleaved caspase-3
  was increased in erythroid differentiated K562 cells (E-K562). miR-125b-5p overexpression
  further enhanced cleaved caspase-3. D, E Representative images of flow cytometry
  assay (left panel) and statistical analysis (right panel) of apoptosis by Annexin-V/PI
  staining in hCB-MNC-derived erythroblasts (D) and erythroid K562 cells (E). Quantitative
  analysis of three independent experiments is shown as the mean ± SD. F Representative
  western blot images show ROCK-1 and active ROCK-1 levels in miR-125b-5p-overexpressing/control
  K562 cells after erythroid differentiation. G Representative western blot images
  show that the overexpression of miR-125b-5p in K562 erythroid cells improved phosphorylated
  MLC2 levels. H Flow cytometry analysis of primary erythroblast enucleation efficiency
  (CD235a+SYTO 16−%) after treatment with Y27632, a small molecule inhibitor of ROCK-1.
  Right panel, Statistical analysis of the enucleation rates of three independent
  experiments is expressed as the mean ± SD (p = 0.0138). I Working model of miR-125b-5p
  in erythroblast enucleation. miR-125b-5p downregulates the expression of Bcl-2 followed
  by mitochondrial depolarization and the activation of caspase-3. ROCK-1 is subsequently
  activated, which results in cytoskeletal rearrangement and efficient enucleation
  (*p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01).
