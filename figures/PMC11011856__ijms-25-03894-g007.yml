caption: Global Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the miRNAs that significantly
  changed their transcription in response to AA (A) or Igf-1 (B). The size of the
  dots represents the number of genes present in each GO term, while the color indicates
  the p-value associated with each GO term identified. The name of the enriched GO
  term is indicated on the left side of the panel, whereas the GO Rich Factor (ratio
  of the number of differentially expressed genes in the pathway to the total number
  of genes in the pathway) is indicated in the lower part of each panel.
