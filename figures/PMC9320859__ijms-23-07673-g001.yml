caption: Effect of AdoMet on miR-34a, miR-34c, and miR-449a expression in CRC cells.
  The relative expression of miR-34a, miR-34c, and miR-449a in HCT-116 (A) and Caco-2
  (B) cells treated with 500 μM AdoMet for 48 h was analyzed by qRT-PCR, following
  normalization with U6 endogenous control. The analysis was carried out by triplicate
  determination of at least 3 separate experiments. The results are expressed as fold-change
  (Log2) ± SD. The means were compared using Student’s t test, * p < 0.05, ** p <
  0.01.
