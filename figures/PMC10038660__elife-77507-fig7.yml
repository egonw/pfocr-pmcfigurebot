figure_title: Mapping the evolution of the most relevant lung squamous cell carcinoma
  (LUSC) pathways to the LUSC developmental stages using published MSigDB transcriptional
  signatures
caption: '(A) Diagram showing the most important pathways involved in LUSC and the
  genes involved in such pathways that are found genetically altered in LUSC tumours.
  (B) Evolution of the SOX2 (the most frequent driver of the squamous differentiation
  pathway) transcriptional signature (SOX2_BENPORATH) during LUSC progression (GSE33479
  cohort). (C) Evolution of the PI3K/Akt pathway during LUSC progression (HALLMARK_PI3K_AKT_MTOR_SIGNALING).
  (D) Evolution of the NRF2 (WP_NRF2_PATHWAY) transcriptional signature (correlated
  with the oxidative stress response) during LUSC progression. (E) Evolution of a
  transcriptional signature correlated with cyclin-D1 and CDK4 (MOLENAAR_TARGETS_OF_CCND1_AND_CDK4_DN)
  during LUSC progression. CDKN2A alterations in LUSC lead to the inactivation of
  the p16INK4a, a CDK4 inhibitor. (F) Evolution of the expression of E2F targets (HALLMARK_E2F_TARGETS).
  Sample size: NN n=13, NH n=14, Hy n=15, Me n=15, MD n=13, MoD n=13, SeD n=12, CIS
  n=13, IC n=14. Boxplots show median and upper/lower quartile. Whiskers show the
  smallest and largest observations within 1.5× IQR. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001,
  p<0.0001 (Welch’s t-test).'
