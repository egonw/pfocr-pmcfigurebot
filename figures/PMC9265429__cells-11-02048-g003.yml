caption: Nrf2 and mTOR mechanism pathway. AKT is one of the procedures of mTOR activity,
  which plays an important role in cellular mechanisms such as cell proliferation,
  cell cycle, and activated p21, which then inhibits Keap1, which alternates the Nrf2
  mechanism. The figure was prepared by software provided by Biorender.com (accessed
