caption: 'Simplified illustration of altered, specialized metabolic pathways by RCD1:
  carotenoid biosynthesis via MEP (methyl erythritol phosphate), MVA (mevalonate)
  pathways, shikimate pathway connected to aromatic amino acids, tocopherol and phylloquinone
  pathway, and aromatic and indole glucosinolates (GLS), as well as flavonoid, stilbene,
  and hydroxycinnamic acid (HCA) pathways. Black, red, and green colors indicate similar,
  increased, or decreased metabolite levels in rcd1, respectively. Grey metabolites
  were not detected. Amino acids (Phe, Tyr, Trp, and Met), phytol, ascorbate (Asc
  and DHA), and tocopherol levels measured previously with GCMS in Sipari et al. [].'
