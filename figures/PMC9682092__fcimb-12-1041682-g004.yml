caption: LncRNA regulates RIG-I signaling pathway in tumor cells. LncRNAs competitively
  bind to miRNA and indirectly inhibit miRNA-targeted mRNA expression, thereby inhibiting
  the activation of the RIG-I downstream signaling pathway. RIG-I acts as a direct
  target of miR-545. LncRNA FTX competitively binds to miR-545, thereby inhibiting
  mRNA expression in HCC cells. LncRNA AFAP1-AS1 affects mRNA, activating the positive-feedback
  regulation loop of IFN signaling and promoting migration and invation of NSCLC.
