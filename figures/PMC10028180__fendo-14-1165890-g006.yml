caption: Pseudotime trajectory analysis and communication analysis of parathyroid
  cells. (A) Pseudotime trajectory analysis of parathyroid cell developmental stages.
  The colormap shows the pseudotime trajectory (B, C) String plot of the aggregated
  cell-cell communication network of male (B) and female (C) parathyroid cells. (D)
  Interaction number and strength comparison between male and female patients *= p
  < 0.05, ns, not statistically significant (unpaired t-test). (E) Differential interaction
  strength comparison between male and female patients. (F) Heatmap of interaction
  numbers and strength in different cell subpopulations. (G) Pathway comparison between
  male and female patients by parathyroid cell subpopulation. (H, I) String plot of
  PTH (H) and FGF (I) signaling pathway networks. (J, K) Heatmap of PTH (J) and FGF
  (K) signaling pathway networks.
