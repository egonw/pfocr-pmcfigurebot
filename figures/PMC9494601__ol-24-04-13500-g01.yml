caption: RNA sequencing data reflected disease states and stages. (A) Pseudo-time
  trajectory analysis of cervical cancer development. (B) Top turning point-enriched
  genes, such as ISG15, ACOT7 and RPL22, in pseudo-time trajectory analysis. (C) Protein-protein
  interaction network showing that ISG15 had a significant regulatory role. (D) KEGG
  pathway and GO BP analysis of turning point-enriched genes showing P-values (black
  dots) and gene counts (bars). ACOT7, acyl-CoA thioesterase 7; ANKRD65, ankyrin repeat
  domain 65; ARHGEF16, rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 16; BP, biological process;
  GO, Gene Ontology; HES2, hes family bHLH transcription factor 2; ISG15, ISG15 ubiquitin-like
  modifier; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; MXRA8, matrix remodeling
  associated 8; NC, normal tissue; PLEKHN1, pleckstrin homology domain containing
  N1; RPL22, ribosomal protein L22; TNFRSF18, TNF receptor superfamily member 18;
  TP, paracarcinoma tissue; TP73, tumour protein p73; TT, primary tumour tissue.
