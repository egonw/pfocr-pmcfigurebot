figure_title: Tumor cell intrinsic mechanisms of eCNTFR-Fc
caption: a. Schematic of the timeline and processing for sample treatment, collection
  and processing for single cell and spatial transcriptomics. Samples were collected
  at one- and three-weeks post treatment start. b. UMAP visualization of 20 identified
  cluster from 19189 cells profiled by 3â€™scRNA analysis. c. Differential gene expression
  analysis of tumor cells at 3 weeks post treatment with eCNTFR-Fc, green is up in
  eCNTFR-Fc treated and orange is down in eCNTFR-Fc treated. d. Pathway analysis of
  differentially expressed genes in the tumor cluster. e-f. GSEA enrichment plots
  of selected pathways. e. MAPK GSEA analysis. f. PD-L1/PD-1 Checkpoint in Cancer
  GSEA analysis. g-h. Protein profiling of matched vehicle and eCNTFR-Fc treated lung
  tumors using Nanostring. Lung sections were imaged using three-color fluorescence
  of CD45 (yellow), PanCK (green) and DNA (blue) to establish overall tissue morphology.
  g. Examples of regions from Vehicle (left) and eCNTFR-Fc (right) treated tissues,
  where line designating the ROI corresponds to expression of the target protein.
  p42/44 MAPK (top) and PD-L1 (bottom) protein. h. Violin plots of protein expression
  for p42/44 MAPK (top) and PD-L1 (bottom). i. Differential protein analysis of tumor
  regions at 3 weeks post treatment with eCNTFR-Fc where green is up in eCNTFR-Fc
  treated and orange is down in eCNTFR-Fc treated.
