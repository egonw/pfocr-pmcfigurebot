caption: 'hUCN1‐induced E2F‐1 protein expression measured by western blotting. Compared
  with the untreated control an increased expression of E2F‐1 transcription factor
  was detected after 24 h in the presence of 10 nm hUCN1. This effect of hUCN1 was
  blocked by U0126, the selective inhibitor of MEK. Reprobing of the membranes for
  beta‐actin served as loading control. The values shown are presented by box + whiskers
  plots, indicating median (central horizontal line), min/max values, and mean (with
  ‘+’ within the box) of three independently performed experiments (n = 3). *P < 0.05
  vs. Control, #P < 0.05 24 h hUCN1 (10 nm) vs. U0126 + 24 h hUCN1 (10 nm; one‐way
  ANOVA, Tukey).'
