caption: 'The effect of ASSNAC alleviated fibrosis through TGF-β1/Smad2/3 signaling
  pathway. (A-B) The protein expressions of TGF-β1 and p-Smad2 were analysed by immunohistochemical
  staining. Scale: 100 µm. (C-F) The protein levels of the TGF-β1/Smad2/3 signaling
  pathway were detected by Western blot analysis in mouse lungs with BLM induction
  and ASSNAC treatment. (G) The TGF-β1 in BALF content was measured. Data are shown
  as the mean ± SD (n = 3). #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001 compared with the
  control group; *p < 0.05, * *p < 0.01, * **p < 0.001 vs the BLM group.'
