caption: Effect of 9r on the viability and morphology of H2O2-treated SH-SY5Y cells.
  (A) Effect of 9r (2.5-80 μM) on the viability of SH-SY5Y cells. (B) Pretreatment
  with SA (syringaresinol, primary chemical), 9r and NHPD (neohesperidin, positive
  control) protected SH−SY5Y cells from H2O2−induced oxidative damage. (C) Effect
  of 9r on morphological changes in SH−SY5Y cells after exposure to 200 μM H2O2. Data
  are provided as the mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments.
  Compared to the described control group, *** p < 0.001. Compared to the H2O2-treated
  group, &p < 0.05, &&p < 0.01 and &&&p < 0.001.
