caption: Bioinformatics analysis identifies miRNAs that have a targeted regulatory
  relationship with JAK2. (A) Targetscan 7.2, miRDB, and Starbase 3.0 were used to
  predict miRNAs that have a targeting relationship with JAK2; (B) the targeted binding
  site of JAK2 to miR-4429. MiRNA, microRNA.
article_title: Genipin protects against mitochondrial damage of the retinal pigment
  epithelium under hyperglycemia through the AKT pathway mediated by the miR-4429/JAK2
  signaling axis.
