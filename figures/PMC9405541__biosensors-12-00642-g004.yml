caption: The regulation effect of the endogenous CRISPRi system targeting gltA. (a)
  The metabolic pathway to the synthetic product. Two acetyl-CoA will condense to
  produce acetoacetyl-CoA, which is catalyzed by acetoacetyl-CoA reductase to generate
  (R)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA. Then, it is polymerized by PHA polymerase to form PHB.
  (b) Comparison of the regulation effect between different plasmid copy numbers.
  Ara58.6 is the strain with the aracr58.6 plasmid, and Ara15A is the strain with
  the aracr15A plasmid. (c) The effect of different regulation times by switching
  red light to green light. Green and red represent continuous exposure to green and
  red light, respectively, whereas X h (X = 5.9) represents switching the light at
  X hours after starting the culture. Data represent the mean ± SD from three independent
  experiments (n = 3).
