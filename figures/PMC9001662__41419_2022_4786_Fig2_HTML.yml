figure_title: Inhibitions of the P2X7/NLRP3 signaling pathway activity in STZ-induced
  diabetic mice
caption: 'a The relative protein expression of P2X7, NLRP3, IL-1β, and IL-18 in the
  retinal tissue of mice at the 12th week, inhibition of P2X7 can reduce the expression
  of P2X7, NLRP3, and the downstream inflammatory factors IL-1β, IL-18. b, c Trypsin
  digestion of the retina for detecting the number of pericytes and acellular capillaries
  after one and three months; yellow arrows indicate acellular capillaries. Pericytes
  and acellular capillaries were quantified in 10 random fields per retina and averaged
  (n = 6). Scale bar: 50 μm. d The plasma LPS concentrations in normal and STZ-induced
  3-month mice groups. e The relative mRNA expression of TNF-α, P2X7, and NLRP3 in
  the retinal tissue of mice at the 12th week. Data are expressed as the means ± SD
  (n = 3). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 vs. the control group.#P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01,
  vs. the DR group or STZ group.'
