caption: The crosstalk between proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) and the infiltrated
  immune cells during kidney interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA). (A)
  A circle plot showing the interactions among cell types across all samples regarding
  the number (left) and the weight/strength of the interactions (right); (B) a heat
  map summarizing the outgoing (secreting) and incoming (target) signal pathways of
  each cell group among all samples; bubble plots of the main signalling pathways
  from PTEC (C) and infiltrated immune cells (D); (E) a bubble plot summarizing the
  comparison of signalling pathways from PTEC to infiltrated immune cells across three
  IFTA grades; a violin plot showing the detailed expression of the genes related
  to the MIF pathway (F) and the SPP1 pathway (G) in each cell types among different
  IFTA grades. CD&PC, connecting ducts and principal cells; DC, dendritic cells; DCT&CNT,
  distal convoluted and connecting tubules; EC, endothelial cells; Fib, fibroblast;
  Fibro&Myofib&Peri&Mes, myofibroblast‐like cells, including fibroblasts, myofibroblasts,
  pericytes and mesangial cells; IC (A + B), intercalated cell types A and B of the
  collecting duct; LOH, loop of Henle; Macro, macrophages; Mono, monocytes; PT, proximal
  tubular epithelial cells; Peri, pericytes; Podo, podocytes

  epithelial cells and immune‐microenvironment in kidney fibrosis.
