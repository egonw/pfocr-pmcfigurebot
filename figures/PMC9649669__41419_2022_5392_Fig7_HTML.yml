figure_title: SR9009 impaired PCa tumor growth and blocked the FOXM1 pathway in vivo
caption: A Experimental procedure of subcutaneous 22RV1 xenograft model building.
  B Tumor sizes were significantly lower in the SR9009 group than in the vehicle group.
  SR9009 was administered at a dose of 100 mg/kg twice per day via intraperitoneal
  injection. C SR9009 impaired PCa tumor growth; n = 4; means ± SDs; ANOVA D tumor
  weights were markedly lower in the SR9009 group than in the vehicle group; n = 4;
  means ± SDs; unpaired t test. E SR9009 reduced mouse body weight; n = 4; means ± SDs;
  ANOVA. F Immunohistochemistry showed that SR9009 downregulated the expression of
  FOXM1, CCNB1, CCNB2, and survivin. G Schematic model of the regulatory network of
  SR9009 in PCa. Data are expressed as the means ± SEMs. ns not significant; *p < 0.05;
  **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001.
