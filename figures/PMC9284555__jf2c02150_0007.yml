caption: Time-concentration curve of EGCG, EGCG-4″-sulfate, and EGCG-4″-glucuronide
  in human plasma. Concentrations of EGCG, EGCG-4″-sulfate, and EGCG-4″-glucuronide
  in human plasma over 6 h after the ingestion of EGCG were determined by LC–MS/MS.
  The values for each point are presented as the mean ± SD of 10 volunteers.
