caption: 'Induction of EMS program in HT29 cells grown as spheroid regulates the cholesterol
  pathway and influences disease‐free survival in colon cancer patients. (A‐C) Experimental
  setting used for the establishment of EMS conditions: HT29 cells were grown in 3D
  with ULA plate for 2 days (Day‐2). At day 0, spheroids were treated with the EMT‐inducing
  cocktail (StemXvivo™ EMT Inducing Media, Biotechne®) for at least 5 days. For EMT‐MET
  samples, spheroids were washed off the EMT‐inducing cocktail at day 5 and grown
  for 4 more days in regular medium (A). Representative images of spheroids observed
  with the Baseline, EMT and EMT‐MET conditions, from days 0 to day 9 (B). Framed
  images correspond to sample collection time points for microarray analysis. The
  light blue boxes identify samples used for the EMT vs Baseline analysis, and the
  dark blue boxes identify samples used for the EMT‐MET vs EMT analysis (B). Gene
  Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of the 3,131 genes differentially regulated between
  Baseline, EMT and EMT‐MET conditions. Sixteen gene‐sets from the MSigDB Molecular
  Signatures Database were differentially regulated in at least one comparison (q‐value<1%):
  Baseline vs. EMT (light blue boxes) or EMT vs. EMT‐MET (dark blue boxes). The three
  gene sets inversely regulated between EMT vs. Baseline and EMT‐MET vs. EMT are framed
  in black boxes (C). (D) Experimental setting used to study statins’ impact on EMS:
  Cells were grown as spheroids for 2 days (Day‐2). From day 0 to day 5, spheroids
  were treated with the EMT inducer. Then, the EMT inducer was washed off and replaced
  with medium, DMSO (0.5%), Ethanol (0.5%), EMT inducer (StemXvivo), Simvastatin (50
  μM) or Lovastatin (50 μM) for 4 days. (E) Representative images of the spheroids
  obtained with each condition, showing that statins prevented EMT‐MET program completion.
  (F) Forest plots showing the hazard ratio for survival events of the 3 selected
  GSEA metagene and recurrence‐free survival in CRC patients in univariate and multivariate
  analyses. A ratio greater than 1.0 indicates poor prognosis and a ratio lower than
  1.0 indicates good prognosis. The horizontal lines for each condition defines the
  95% confidence interval. Statistical values were obtained with a Wald test. (G)
  Kaplan‐Meier curves for RFS according to the four groups used to build the multi‐metagene
  model: “EMT”‐negative/“Cholesterol homeostasis”‐positive group (green, n = 452),
  “EMT”‐negative/“Cholesterol homeostasis”‐negative group (black, n = 445), “EMT”‐positive/“Cholesterol
  homeostasis”‐positive group (blue, n = 481), and “EMT”‐positive/“Cholesterol homeostasis”‐negative
  group (red, n = 459). Statistical values were obtained with a log‐rank test. (H)
  Scheme of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and hypothetical impact on tumors
  molecular differentiation. Cholesterol is involved in multiple biological homeostatic
  metabolic processes (bile acids, steroid hormones and vitamin D precursors, membrane
  stability and rigidity, lipid raft organization). Cholesterol inhibits the synthesis
  of SREBP1, a transcription factor for the TGFβ1 signaling. TGFβ1 signaling is a
  key feature of the CMS4 mesenchymal class. Our data suggest that low cholesterol
  in a pro‐EMT environment may favor the shift towards CMS4 mesenchymal tumors, while
  high cholesterol may favor more epithelial‐like differentiated tumors. Genes downregulated
  in the Cholesterol homeostasis metagene are labelled in red. Statins are inhibitors
  of the HMGCR enzyme and are labelled in green. Abbreviations: 3D, three dimensions;
  ULA, ultra‐low adhesion; EMT, epithelial‐to‐mesenchymal transition; MET, mesenchymal‐to‐epithelial
