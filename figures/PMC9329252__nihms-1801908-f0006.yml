figure_title: The rs5743836 TLR9T>C SNP correlated with IM, GAC and higher TLR9/IFNα/SLFN12L
  expression in the infected stomach
caption: '(A) Association of the minor TLR9 C allele (at −1237 from promoter start
  site) frequency with gastric metaplasia or gastric cancer (GAC) in Vietnamese and
  Chinese patient cohorts. * P< .05 over uninfected control group within the cohort.
  NS, not significant. HP: H. pylori; G: Gastritis; A:gastric atrophy; IM:Intestinal
  metaplasia; GAC:gastric cancer. Representative images showing IHC staining for (B)
  TLR9 (D) IFNα and (F) SLFN12L in gastric biopsies from uninfected Vietnamese patients
  with gastritis (Hp− G), H. pylori-infected gastritis (Hp+ G), H. pylori-infected
  patients with gastric atrophy (Hp+ A) or H. pylori-infected patients with atrophy
  and IM (Hp+ A+IM) carrying both major T alleles TLR9 −1237T/T or carrying at least
  one minor TLR9 −1237C allele. Mag: 200X. Histologic scoring of (C) TLR9 (E) IFNα
  and (G) SLFN12L were shown as bar graphs. Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA with Dunn’s test
  of multiple comparisons was performed. (H) Representative Alcian blue staining for
  patients with intestinal metaplasia and atrophy and carrying either the T/T or T/C
  alleles. Horizontal lines represent the median and interquartile range. *P< .05.
  **P< .01. ***P< .001. ****P< .0001.'
