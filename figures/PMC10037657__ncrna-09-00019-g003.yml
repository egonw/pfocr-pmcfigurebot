caption: The potential targets of LncRNA H19 in HCC. (A) H19 induced the expression
  of PI3K, which further activated the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, thus modulating
  autophagy and eventually promoting the development of HCC. (B) H19 induced the expression
  of EZH2, which further activated the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway, thus regulating
  proliferation and eventually promoting the development of HCC.
