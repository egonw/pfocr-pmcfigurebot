caption: 'A graphic summary of the present study. A schematic drawing shows the working
  model of SAL-mediated neurite and mitochondrial protection in AD. Our findings suggest
  that SAL-mediated neurite and mitochondrial protection is dependent on SIRT3 expression.
  An elucidated mechanism of action is shown: SAL directly binds to transcription
  factor NRF2 and prevents its degradation by inhibiting the attachment of E3 ligase
  KEAP1, then promotes nuclear translocation of NRF2, and eventually favors SIRT3
  transcription'
