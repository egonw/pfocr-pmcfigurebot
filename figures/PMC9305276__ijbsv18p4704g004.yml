caption: Regulation of host inflammation by Nucleocapsid protein. First, SARS-COV-2
  N protein can inhibit IFN-β production by targeting each step of the RIG-I signaling
  pathway. Second, with viral RNA, N protein undergoes LLPS to recruit TAK1 and IKK
  complex, and then promotes NF-κB activation. Third, N protein interacts directly
  with NLRP3 protein to promote the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.
