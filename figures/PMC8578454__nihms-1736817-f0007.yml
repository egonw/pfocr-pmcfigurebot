figure_title: Direct stimulation of IPN induces GABAB receptor-mediated inhibition
  in terminals at the dIPN
caption: (A) Schematic of setup for simultaneous electrical stimulation and drug perfusion.(B)
  Representative ΔF/F traces showing attenuation of dIPN inhibition by electrical
  stimulation after cgp55845 perfusion (top), with bursts unaffected in the raphe
  (bottom). Grey boxes represent 10 min after cgp55845 application. See also .(C,D)
  Average traces (black) of calcium events (grey, 10 stimuli) before (c) and after
  (d) cgp55845.(E) Paired plot of average peak amplitudes before and after cgp55845
  application during inhibition (top, −0.15 ± 0.07 vs. −0.02 ± 0.02) and burst (bottom,
  0.22 ± 0.08 vs 0.2 ± 0.06). n = 6 explants, 71 events. Purple dotted lines indicate
  time of electrical stimulation (B-D). Purple line in (B) denotes duration of cgp55845
  application. Wilcoxon signed-rank test, * p< 0.05, n.s. not significant. Mean ±
  SD indicated.(F) Transverse section of Tg(gng8:GAL4ff)c426;Tg(UAS:GFP)c426;Tg(gad1b:|R|-GFP)
  larval IPN surrounded by dHb terminals (green) and GABAergic neurons (magenta).
  Hoechst nuclear staining (blue). White asterisks indicate gad1b:RFP+ neurons in
  vIPN. White dotted line separates dIPN and vIPN (right panel).(G) Model illustrating
  the mechanism underlying negatively correlated events in dHb terminals at the IPN
  (see ).
