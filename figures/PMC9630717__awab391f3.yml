caption: Functional analysis of five GABRD variants in α4β2δ receptors.  X. laevis
  oocytes were injected with cRNA mixtures of free α4, β2 and δ subunits in a 3:1:3
  ratio and subjected to two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology. (A) GABAmax-evoked
  peak-current amplitudes for the indicated receptors are depicted as box with whiskers,
  where the box marks the first, second and third quartiles and whiskers extend to
  minimum and maximum values observed for n = 30 experiments. The mean value is additionally
  indicated for each dataset (). Datasets were significantly different with the indicated
  significance levels between variant and the wild-type (WT) receptor (P < 0.0001,
  ANOVA Kruskal–Wallis test, post hoc Dunn’s test). (B) Normalized GABA-evoked peak
  current amplitudes are depicted as mean ± SD as a function of the GABA concentration
  for n = 11–14 experiments for the indicated receptors. A Hill equation was fitted
  to the data using non-linear regression and fitted EC50 values are indicated in
  the panel. Full regression results are presented in  and . (C) Estimated open probabilities
  were calculated by comparing the response of GABAmax (316 µM) to the response of
  a mixture of GABAmax, allopregnanolone (3.16 µM), etomidate (31.6 µM) and DS2 (10
  µM) for the indicated receptors (see also ). Data are depicted as box with whiskers
  for n = 18–22 experiments with indication of mean values () and were significantly
  different (P < 0.0001, ANOVA Kruskal–Wallis test, post hoc Dunn’s test). *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001.
