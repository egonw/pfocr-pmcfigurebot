caption: 'The effect of miR-4739/ITGA10 on the activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway
  (A–B) The relative expression levels of phosphorylated PI3K (p-PI3K), total PI3K
  (PI3K), phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) and total AKT (AKT) proteins were determined
  by Western blot. Data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. ∗∗P < 0.01
  versus NC group, && P < 0.01 versus inhibitor group and ##P < 0.01 versus si-ITGA10
  group.'
