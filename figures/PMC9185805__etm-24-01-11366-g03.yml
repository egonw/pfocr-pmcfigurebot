caption: 'Effect of insulin, liraglutide and combined drugs on the expression of Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway-related mRNAs and proteins in diabetic mice. (A) Relative mRNA
  expression levels of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway-related proteins were determined
  using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. (B and C) Relative protein expression
  levels of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway-related proteins were detected via western
  blotting. β-actin was included as a reference for normalization. Data are presented
  as the mean ± SD (n=4/group). *P<0.05 vs. NGT; #P<0.05 vs. STZ; †P<0.05 vs. INS;
  ‡P<0.05 vs. LRG. STZ, saline treated type 1 diabetes group; INS, insulin treatment
  group; LRG, liraglutide treatment group; INS + LRG, insulin and liraglutide treatment
  group; NGT, normal glucose tolerance group; p, phosphorylated.'
