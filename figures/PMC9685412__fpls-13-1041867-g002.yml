caption: KPILP downregulation in PVX-infected N. benthamiana plants leads to decreased
  accumulation of PsbQ. (A) Analysis of total soluble protein from leaves with systemic
  infection induced by pPVX or pPVX(frKPILP) and control intact plants in polyacrylamide
  gel followed by Coomassie staining. Bands corresponding to PVX CP are indicated
  with red arrowheads, bands corresponding to PsbQ 16kDa protein are indicated with
  black arrowheads. M, protein weight markers. (B) Relative amount of PsbQ mRNA in
  the intact and PVX-infected plants as determined by qPCR. Mean values and standard
  errors are presented. The level of mRNA accumulation for control was taken as 1.
  Difference between control and samples from PVX-infected plants is significant at
  p<0.05 (ANOVA, Tukey’s HSD test). Bars without shared letters indicate significant
  differences. The difference between pPVX and pPVX(frKPILP) is significant at p<0.09.
