caption: Glutamine uptake, transport, and metabolism. Glutamine uptake and transport
  in cancer cells is mediated by transporters (ASCT2/ATB0,+/SNAT1,2,3). Intracellular
  glutamine can be converted into α-KG through the glutaminase I (GLS+GDH/transaminase)
  or II (GTK/GTL/KAT2+ω-amidase) pathway. Aspartate, alanine, and serine are mainly
  produced via transaminases, such as GOT, GPT, and PSAT. GOT transforms glutamate
  into aspartate, which is essential for purine, pyrimidine, and protein synthesis.
  Aspartate is further converted to asparagine via ASNS. GPT catalyzes the reversible
  conversion of glutamate to pyruvate for α-KG and alanine generation. This GPT-catalyzed
  reaction plays a vital role in the glucose–alanine cycle, which is essential to
  support liver gluconeogenesis. PSAT transforms glutamate into serine, which is involved
  in nucleotide and protein synthesis. α-KG is an important anaplerotic substrate
  of the TCA cycle, in which FH, IDH, and SDH mutations are the main causes of cycle
  dysfunction and mitochondrial metabolic defects in various types of cancers. Glutamine
  can be synthesized from glutamate via GS. Glutamine can also be converted to ornithine
  and proline, which regulate apoptosis/autophagy. The byproduct of glutaminolysis,
  ammonia, can modulate autophagy under specific circumstances. The reductive carboxylation
  of α-KG into citrate can support adipogenesis, which is crucial for cancer cell
  survival. The GDH pathway is also linked to cellular ROS homeostasis, and further
  modulates autophagy, which can also be regulated by AAs through the mTOR pathway.
  Glutamate is exchanged for cystine via xCT, which is rapidly reduced to cysteine
  by CR. Then, glutamate, cysteine, and glycine react together for de novo synthesis
  of glutathione via GCL and GSS. The interconversion of oxidized glutathione and
  glutathione is catalyzed by GSR, and glutathione can directly control redox homeostasis.
