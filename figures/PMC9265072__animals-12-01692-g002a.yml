caption: Effect of Chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) on milk fat synthesis of bovine
  mammary epithelial cells (BMECs). The levels of triglyceride (TG) (A), non-esterified
  fatty acids (NFFA) (B) and cholesterol (C) in BMECs treated with COS (0, 100, 150
  μg/mL) for 24 h were measured. Further, verify that COS inhibits milk fat synthesis.
  The mRNA expression of HSL and patatin like phospholipase domain containing 2 (ATGL)
  related to triglyceride decomposition (D); the mRNA expression of genes diacylglycerol
  O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAM) related
  to triglyceride synthesis (E); the mRNA expression of genes PPARG coactivator 1
  beta (PPARGC1B), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) and PPARα related to
  triglyceride decomposition (F); the mRNA expression of genes SCD1, FASN and acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase alpha (ACACA) related to free fatty acid synthesis (G). The data are
  presented as the mean ± SEM (n = 3). Different small letters showed significant
  difference (p < 0.05), different capital letters showed extremely significant difference
  (p < 0.01), and the same letters or unmarked letters had no significant difference.
