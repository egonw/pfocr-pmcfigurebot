caption: 'The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway was decreased by metformin in UVA-induced
  senescent cells. (a−e) Cells were treated with UVA alone or in combination with
  100 μM metformin, the protein levels of p-PI3K/PI3K, p-AKT/AKT, p-mTOR/mTOR, p-4EBP1/4EBP1,
  were measured by western blot. Data are presented as mean ± SD, n = 3. ##p < 0.01,
  ###p < 0.001 vs. control cells, * p < 0.05, ** p <0.01 vs. UVA-treated cells.'
