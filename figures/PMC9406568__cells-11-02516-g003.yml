caption: 'Kennedy pathway metabolites are altered upon knockout of E12 in H1299 cells.
  (A). Schematic overview of the Kennedy pathway. CDP-DAG: CDP-diacylglycerol; PI:
  phosphatidylinositol; PG: phosphatidylglycerol; CL: cardiolipin; PS: phosphatidylserine;
  Cho: choline; P-cho: phosphocholine, CDP-cho: cytidine diphosphate-choline; Etn:
  ethanolamine, P-Etn: phosphoethanolamine; CDP-Etn: cytidine diphosphate-ethanolamine;
  SM: sphingomyelin; CER: ceramide; DAG: diacylglycerol; TAG: triacylglycerol; FA:
  fatty acid; CTL1: choline transporter-like protein 1. (B,C). Relative abundance
  of (B) phosphatidylcholines and lysophosphatidylcholines and (C) phosphatidylethanolamines
  and lysophosphatidylethanolamines in isogenic control and E12−/− H1299 cells. Statistical
  significance was determined using Student’s t-test. (D). Heat map of differentially
  expressed genes identified by RNA-seq analysis in isogenic control and E12−/− H1299
  cell lines. Color density indicating z-score values was displayed below. (E–H).
  (Left) qPCR was used to quantify relative mRNA levels of PCYT1A, CEPT1, SMPD4, and
  SLC44A1 in isogenic control and E12−/− H1299 cell lines. All values were normalized
  to HPRT1 and are presented as relative to isogenic control (light green). Statistical
  significance was determined using Student’s t-test. (Right) Western blot analysis
  was used to determine CCTa, CEPT1, SMPD4, CTL1, and GAPDH protein levels in isogenic
  control and E12−/− H1299 cell lines. (I,J). Relative abundance of (I) diacylglycerols,
  fatty acids, and triacylglycerols, and (E) choline and ethanolamine in isogenic
  control and E12−/− H1299 cells. Statistical significance was determined using Student’s
  t-test. For B-C and E-J. Data presented as mean ± SEM. n = 3 independent experiments.
