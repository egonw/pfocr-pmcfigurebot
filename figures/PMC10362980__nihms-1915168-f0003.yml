caption: NF-kB signaling in Jurkat cells transduced with IKKb WT or the variants.
  A WT or mutant transduced Jurkat T cells were stimulated with TNF-a (100 ng/ml)
  for the indicated time and Western blotting was performed with NF-kB pathway antibodies.
  b-actin used as a loading control. B The relative band intensity of each protein
  was normalized to b-actin and to WT controls. p-IKKa/b /IKKb and p-p65/p65 values
  indicate that the phosphorylated values were normalized to the total protein of
  IKKb and p65, respectively, and to b-actin. Data are means ± SD from three independent
  experiments. Dotted lines indicate the average values of unstimulated WT samples.
  C HEK-293 T cells were co-transfected with pGL4.32-NF-kB, pTL-RK, and indicated
  IKBKB expression vectors. Next day, luciferase activity was measured using dual-luciferase
  reporter assay system. The firefly luciferase activity was normalized to the Renilla
  luciferase activity and then the results were normalized to the WT control. Each
  experiment was carried out in duplicate. Data are means ± SD from three independent
  experiments
