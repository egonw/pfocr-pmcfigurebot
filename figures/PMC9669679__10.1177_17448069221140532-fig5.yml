caption: 'Intrathecal administration C3aR antagonist alleviated neuropathic pain and
  decreased M1 polarization of microglia. A–B. Mechanical allodynia (A) and thermal
  hyperalgesia (B) in CCI model were attenuated by intrathecal administration of C3aR
  inhibitor (Trifluoroacetate). The gray panel indicated the duration of drug administration
  from POD7 to POD12. N = 7, Two-way ANOVA, *p < 0.05, **p < .01, ***p < .001, ****p
  < .0001, CCI + Vehicle versus CCI + Trifluoroacetate (20ug); #p < .05, ##p < .01,
  ####p < .0001, CCI + Vehicle versus CCI + Trifluoroacetate (10ug); ^p < .05, ^^p
  < .01, CCI + Trifluoroacetate (10ug) CCI + Trifluoroacetate (20ug). C. Immunostaining
  showed inhibitory effects of Trifluoroacetate on activation of astrocyte on POD12.
  Scale bar: 100 μm. D. Data summary of fluorescence intensity of GFAP on POD12. N
  = 6 sections from 3 rats, **p < .01, CCI + Vehicle versus CCI + Trifluoroacetate
  (20ug), t test. E. Immunostaining showed inhibitory effects of Trifluoroacetate
  on activation of microglia. Scale bar: 100 μm. F. Data summary of fluorescence intensity
  of IBA1 on POD12. N = 6 sections from 3 rats, **p < .01, CCI + Vehicle versus CCI
  + Trifluoroacetate (20ug), t test. G. qPCR analyzed the expression of M1 (CD86 and
  inos) and M2 (CD206 and Arg1) markers for CCI rats receiving Vehicle or Trifluoroacetate
  (20ug) injection on POD12. N = 4, *p < .05, **p < .01, CCI + Vehicle versus CCI
  + Trifluoroacetate, t test. CCI: chronic constriction injury.'
