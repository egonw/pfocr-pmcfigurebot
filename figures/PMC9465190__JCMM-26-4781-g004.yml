caption: The mechanism of mAb 201E4 induced apoptosis in cancer cells. (A) Flow cytometry
  of cell cycle phase distribution and the percentages of cell cycle population were
  shown after 24 h of mAb 201E4 treatment (100 and 200 μg/ml) in AGS cells. Non‐specific
  mouse IgG was as a control. Data shown are the mean values of three independent
  experiments ±SD. *p < 0.05 versus the control. ***p < 0.001 versus the control.
  (B) mAb 201E4 induces apoptosis in AGS cells by flow cytometry. AGS cells were treated
  with mAb 201E4 (100 and 200 μg/ml) for 24 h. Apoptosis was monitored by Annexin
  V/PI double staining. Percentages of early apoptotic cells, late apoptotic cells,
  and dead cells in AGS treated with mAb 201E4 (100 and 200 μg/ml) were shown. Non‐specific
  mouse IgG was as a control. The values are means ± SD of three independent experiments.
  ***p < 0.001 versus the control. (C–E) Time‐dependent effects of mAb 201E4 on the
  expression of proteins in the caspase apoptotic pathway, the proliferation pathway,
  the mitochondral apoptotic pathway in immunoblot analysis, respectively. AGS cells
  were treated with mAb 201E4 (20 μg/ml) at 0, 2, 6, 12, 24, and 36 h.
