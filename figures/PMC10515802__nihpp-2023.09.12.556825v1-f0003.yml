figure_title: Comparative analysis of two RNA sequencing sets reveals DUSP1 as an
  overlapping significantly upregulated gene, known to negatively regulate inflammatory
  processes
caption: '(A) A schema of the unbiased omics analysis undertaken in this study. The
  NK cells from the indicated human sub-groups or after LDL exposure were used for
  gene expression profiling or for proteomics as indicated. Subsequent downstream
  analysis helped identify common targets and led to the identification of Dusp1.
  Freshly isolated primary NK cells from 1) either AA women with or without O/O (dataset
  1 1: n=5 each group) or 2) healthy donors treated with vehicle or LDL overnight
  (dataset 2: n=4) were subjected to RNAsequencing analysis. Vehicle/LDL treated NK
  cells were additionally subjected to proteomics analysis (n=4).(B-C) Top 15 pathways
  enriched by differentially expressed genes in either NO/O vs O/O (B) or control
  vs. LDL (C) NK cells presented as a dot plot. Each dot is a pathway labeled on y-axis,
  the size of the dot is scaled to the number of DE genes overlapping with the pathway
  and are plotted on negative log 10 q value on the x-axis.(D) Venn diagram showing
  overlap of differentially expressed genes identified in the NO/O vs. O/O comparison
  and control vs. LDL comparison. 487 genes were commonly differentially expressed
  genes between both datasets.(E) Top 15 pathways enriched by 487 commonly differentially
  expressed genes shown in D is presented as a dot plot. Each dot is a pathway labeled
  on y-axis, the size of the dot is scaled to the number of DE genes overlapping with
  the pathway and are plotted on negative log 10 q value scale on the x-axis.(F) Flow
  cytometry analysis of Dusp1 protein expression in vehicle or LDL exposed healthy
  donor NK cells. (n=6, unpaired t-Test)(G) Partial least square discriminant analysis
  (PLSDA) plot of the proteomics data from the control and LDL exposed samples.(H)
  Variables important in predicting the control and LDL exposed NK cells. The VIP
  score of the indicated proteins on the y axis and their mean expression in control
  and LDL treated NK cells on the x axis is presented.'
