caption: 'Model organisms played a significant role in uncovering cell death mechanisms.
  Abnormal regulation of apoptosis and autophagy is linked to numerous diseases. (A)
  The core apoptotic pathway was identified in the worm []. (B) Studies on mice contributed
  to the discovery of interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (ICE) caspases []. (C) Genetic
  regulation of autophagy was discovered in yeast []. (D) Some diseases related to
  abnormally regulated autophagy are discussed in this Special Issue: enhancing autophagic
  activity is an efficient tool to treat neurodegenerative disorders []. To prevent
  or treat sarcopenia, increasing mitophagy is a promising target []. Increased autophagic
  activity may also be useful to attenuate neuropathic pain behavior []. In cancer-related
  processes, autophagy plays dual roles. In this Special Issue, different treatments
  influencing autophagic activity and mitophagy were performed on breast, lung, pancreas,
  and colon cancer cell lines [,]. An illustration of this figure was partly created
  using BioRender.com (accessed on 2 March 2023).'
