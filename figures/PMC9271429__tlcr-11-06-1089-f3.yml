caption: 'STT3A knockout inhibits tumor invasion and migration via EMT. (A) Knockout
  of STT3A inhibited PC-9 and H1299 cell migration detected by transwell assays: cell
  counts for the transwell assays are indicated below. Scale bar: 100 µm. (B) Transwell
  assays with Matrigel were used to confirm the effects of STT3A on tumor cell invasiveness.
  Scale bar: 100 µm. (C,D) The migration ability of the transfected PC-9 and H1299
  cells was verified by a wound-healing experiment. The quantification data are also
  indicated, Scale bar: 500 µm. (E) Western blot analysis of EMT-related proteins
  E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin. Staining method for (A,B): 0.1% crystal violet;
  magnification, ×100. The data are presented as mean ± standard deviation according
  to the Student’s t-test. **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.001. sgNC, small guide RNA negative
  control; sgSTT3A, small guide RNA of STT3A; STT3A, STT3 oligosaccharyltransferase
  complex catalytic subunit A; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition.'
