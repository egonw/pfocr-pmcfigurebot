figure_title: cGAS-STING canonical pathway is active and responsive in high risk HPV
  positive keratinocytes
caption: '(A) Western blot analysis of the canonical cGAS-STING factors upon 2’3’-cGAMP
  treatment. Primary keratinocytes HFKs and HFK16 cells keratinocytes were permeabilized
  with digitoinin and treated with 5μG/mL cGAMP for 4hrs (B) Response of downstream
  factors in cGAS pathway to different concentrations of cGAMP. HFKs, HFK-31 and CIN612
  cells derived from a CIN lesion were examined. Cells were digitonin permeabilized
  and treated with 2 or 20μG/Ll cGAMP for 4hrs followed by western analysis. (C) Quantitative
  PCR analysis for IFN-β mRNA following cGAMP treatment as described above. Each set
  includes 3 technical replicates. Levels are shown relative to untreated HFKs. To
  determine significance of IFN production in HFKs statistical analysis used: two-tailed
  unpaired T-test; p<0.05 indicates significance compared to control HFK. Where (*)
  <0.05 and (****) <0.0001. Unpaired T-test to determine significance in HFKs. (D)
  Western analysis of HFK and CIN612 cells for phosphorylated STING and IRF3 at 4hrs
  post transfection of 1uG/mL poly (dA:dT).'
