caption: ClC-5 expression was up-regulated in human CCA tumor tissues and CCA cell
  lines. (A) The mRNA levels of ClC-5 in CCA tumor tissues and paracancer normal tissues,
  mean ± SD; n = 30 cases/group, **P < 0.01 vs. Normal tissue. (B, C) The protein
  level of ClC-5 in CCA tumor tissues and paracancer normal tissues, mean ± SD; n
  = 5 cases/group, **P < 0.01 vs. Normal tissue. (D) The expression distribution of
  ClC-5 in CCA tissues with different stages was detected by immunohistochemistry.
  (E-G) The mRNA (E) and protein (F, G) level of ClC-5 in human CCA cell lines (QBC939,
  SNU-869, TFK-1, and RBE cells) and human normal biliary epithelial cells (HEBEpiC
  and HIBEpiC). mean ± SD; n = 4, **P < 0.01 vs. HEBEpiC or HIBEpiC cells.

  in cholangiocarcinoma cells through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
