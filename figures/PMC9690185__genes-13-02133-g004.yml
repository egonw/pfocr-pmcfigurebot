caption: Oridonin participates in the regulation of the NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway.
  (A) Representative western blot results of NLRP3, ASC, p65, and p-p65 from each
  group. (B) Densitometric quantification of NLRP3 based on (A). (C) Densitometric
  quantification of ASC based on (A). (D) Densitometric quantification of the ratio
  of p65/p-p65 based on (A). (E) Representative immunohistochemistry results in NRCMs
  from each group. All samples are from NRCMs. The protein level was standardized
  using GAPDH. In all cases, the data are expressed as the mean ± SD.
