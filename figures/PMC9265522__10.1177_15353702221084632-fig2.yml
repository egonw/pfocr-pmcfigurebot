caption: 'Niacin decreased lysosomal free cholesterol accumulation and cholesterol
  crystals formation in vivo. (A) Confocal microscopy imaging shows the decrease of
  lysosomal cholesterol crystals in aorta root of NA-treated LDLr−/− mice (Bar, 50
  µm). (B) Transmission electron microscopic examination of lesional cholesterol crystal
  clefts in LDLr−/− mice fed with/without NA in water along with a Western diet. (B1
  and B2) Cholesterol crystal clefts in macrophages of LDLr−/− mice fed with Western
  diet (LDLr−/− + WD, n = 3). (B3 and B4) Cholesterol crystal clefts in macrophages
  from LDLr−/− mice fed with Western diet and niacin (LDLr−/− + WD + NA, n = 3; Bar,
  5 µm). (C) Transmitted electron microcopy examination of free cholesterol accumulation
  in LDLr−/− macrophages treated with oxLDL in culture without/with niacin (2.0 mmol/L).
  (C1) LDLr−/− macrophages treated with oxLDL (LDLr−/− + oxLDL). (C2) Amplified area
  of the squared portion in A1. (C3) LDLr−/− macrophages treated with oxLDL with niacin
  (LDLr−/− + oxLDL + NA). (C4) Amplified area of the squared portion in A3. Cholesterol
  crystals (arrow) in lysosomes (an abundant single membrane-bounded electron-dense
  structure, n = 3) (C1 and C3, Bar, 1 µm; C2 and C4, Bar, 500 nm). (A color version
  of this figure is available in the online journal.)NA: niacin; Ctrl: control; oxLDL:
  oxidized low-density lipoprotein; LDLr−/−: low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout;
  WD: Western diet.'
