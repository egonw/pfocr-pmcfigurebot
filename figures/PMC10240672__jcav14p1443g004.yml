caption: 'APEX1 can regulate Notch signal pathway including Jagged1, and APEX1 knockdown
  and Jagged1 knockdown present similar biological function in regulating proliferation,
  migration, invasion, and apoptosis of CD133+ GBC-SD cells. (A) qRT-PCR and (B) western
  blot were used to evaluated the expression of Notch signaling members. (C) Jagged1
  protein expression was detected by western blot in CD133+ GBC-SD cells transfected
  with different Jagged1 shRNAs. (D) CCK8 and (E) colony formation assays were used
  to assess the proliferation of CD133+ GBC-SD cells transfected with control shRNA,
  APEX1 shRNA, or Jagged1 shRNA. (F) and (G) Transwell assay was subjected to tested
  the migration and invasion of CD133+ GBC-SD cells transfected with shRNA, APEX1
  shRNA, or Jagged1 shRNA. (H) Apoptosis of CD133+ GBC-SD cells transfected with control
  shRNA, APEX1 shRNA, or Jagged1 shRNA was tested via flow cytometry assay; UL: necrosis
  cells, UR: late apoptosis cells, LL: normal cells, LR: early apoptosis cells. **
