caption: Immunofluorescence staining of Nrf2 and NLRP3 in spinal anterior horn motor
  neuron cells near the injury site of mice, 3 days after SCI. Nrf2 (A,B) and NLRP3
  (C,D) proteins in the spinal anterior horn motor neuron cells of mice in groups
  were detected by immunofluorescence double staining (n = 6, scale bar = 100 µm).
  Data are shown as the means ± SD; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
