caption: A proposed model for the regulatory network of OsPDT1. In WT rice, OsPDT1
  is localized in the Golgi apparatus and is involved in pectin synthesis; pectin
  is transported to the cell wall via SVC, and OsiWAK1 may assemble with pectin there;
  with the secretion of pectin, the OsiWAK1 is also transported to the cell periphery,
  and delays the tapetal program cell death there. In ospdt1, the mutated OsPDT1 causes
  defective pectin synthesis, which may affect the integration of pectin and OsiWAK1;
  it is possible that less OsiWAK1 is transported to the cell periphery, which causes
  premature tapetal program cell death in the ospdt1 mutant.
