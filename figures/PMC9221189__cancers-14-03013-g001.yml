caption: Schematic representation of the mammalian Hippo pathway. The Hippo kinase
  cascade, composed of Ser/Thr kinases MST1/2 and LATS1/2, adaptor proteins SAV1 and
  MOB1, and effectors YAP/TAZ, is regulated by various stimuli, including cell–cell
  junctions, cellular stresses, mechanical cues, and multiple extracellular signaling
  molecules. A “+” indicates a stimulus that increases the activity of the Hippo pathway,
  and a “−” indicates a stimulus that decreases activity. The Hippo pathway phosphorylates
  YAP/TAZ, leading to their cytoplasmic sequestration and proteasomal degradation.
  Dephosphorylated YAP/TAZ translocate into the nucleus and act as transcriptional
  cofactors, thereby controlling cellular responses such as proliferation, survival,
  and metastasis and affecting stemness, regeneration, organ size, and tissue homeostasis.
