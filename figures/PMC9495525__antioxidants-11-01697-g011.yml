caption: Effects of OLNZ on antioxidant enzyme (SOD-1, SOD-2) gene and protein expression
  in H2O2-induced SH-SY5Y cells. The expression of (%). (A) SOD-1 and (B) SOD-2 genes
  and (C) SOD-1 and (D) SOD-2 proteins was increased after pre-incubation with OLNZ
  in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were expressed as the mean Â± SEM, and
  the experiment was repeated three times. (#) compared to the control and (*) compared
  to H2O2, p < 0.05.
