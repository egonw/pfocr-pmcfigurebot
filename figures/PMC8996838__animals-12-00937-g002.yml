caption: BPA induces malformation during X. tropicalis embryonic development. The
  embryos were exposed to different concentrations of BPA for 12 h; when the BPA was
  removed, the embryos were at stage 10.5 (early gastrula) ((A) 1–5), and the malformation
  analysis ended at the later tadpole stage 46 ((A) 6–10). The malformation rates
  were statistically analyzed at 12 h (stage 10.5) (B) and 72 h (stage 46) (D). The
  mortality rates were statistically analyzed at 12 h (stage 10.5) (C) and 72 h (stage
  46) (E). Different letters above the bars indicate significant differences among
  groups (a > b > c > d, p < 0.05). n = 300/treatment.
