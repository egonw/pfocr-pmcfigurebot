caption: RT induces MOMP, which triggers activation of Caspase 9‐mediated intrinsic
  apoptosis. If the intrinsic apoptosis is inhibited, MOMP results in release of mtDNA
  into a cytosol. RT also directly damages DNA leading to accumulation of cytoplasmic
  DNA fragments. Moreover, incorrect damage repair, drives the formation of micronuclei.
  mtDNA, cytoplasmic DNA and micronuclei are recognized by cGAS, which stimulates
  production of type‐1 IFNs in a STING‐IRF3‐dependent manner. Additionally, cytoplasmic
  DNA fragments can be transcribed into RNAs by the RNA polymerase III. Through activation
  of RIG‐I/MDA5‐MAVS‐IRF3 pathway cytoplasmic RNA species can also promote IFN‐1 signalling.
  Subsequent release of pro‐inflammatory cytokines and chemokines triggers Caspase
  8‐mediated extrinsic apoptosis, and anti‐tumour immunity by CD8+ T and NK cells.
  Importantly, the anti‐tumour immunity is directed against distal lesions as well
  as the irradiated site in a process called the abscopal effect. RT, radiotherapy;
