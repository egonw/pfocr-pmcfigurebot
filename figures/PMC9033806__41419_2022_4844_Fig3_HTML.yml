figure_title: GXYLT1 promotes CRC cell migration and invasion, while GXYLT1S212* exerts
  a stronger effect in vitro
caption: 'a Somatic mutations in the GXYLT1 functional domain. Numbers represent amino
  acid residues. Each dot represents an individual mutated tumor sample. Blue dot:
  missense mutation. Purple dot: nonsense mutation. b, f Cell viability was assessed
  using CCK-8 assays in CRC cells transfected as indicated. c, g Representative images
  of colony formation in CRC cells transfected as indicated. Graphs show the numbers
  of colonies. d, h Transwell migration and invasion assays in CRC cells transfected
  as indicated. Graphs show quantification of migrated cells. e, i Wound-healing assays
  to evaluate cell migration in CRC cells transfected as indicated. Graphs show quantification
  of the wound-healing area. Data are presented as the mean ± SD of at least three
  independent experiments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.'
