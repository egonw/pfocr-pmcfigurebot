caption: Cis-regulation of lncRNAs with target genes. (A) The Venn plot of unique
  lncRNAs or mRNAs in cis-regulation with co-expressed lncRNAs or mRNA. (B) Subtype
  statistics of key cis-regulatory mRNA. According to the illustration, “Genic” includes
  the subtypes of “overlapping”, “containing”, and “nested”; “Intergenic” consists
  of “same strand”, “convergent”, and “divergent” subtypes. (C) Genome location statistics
  of key cis-regulatory mRNA. (D) KEGG enrichment analysis of target genes regulated
  by lncRNA homeopathy. (E) The chord graph showing the targeting relationship between
  key genes in the cellular senescence signaling pathway and lncRNA.
