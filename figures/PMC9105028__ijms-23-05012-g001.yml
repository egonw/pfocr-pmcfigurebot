caption: Characterization and homing effect of UDSCs. (A) Isolation and culture of
  UDSC. (a) Non-adherent cells in s fresh urine sample (Day 0). (b) Cell attachment
  (Day 3). (c) Colony formation of rice grain-shaped cells (Day 10). (d) Morphological
  changes into spindle-shaped cells (Passage 1). (B) Representative growth curve of
  the UDSCs. (a) The cumulative population doubling level (CPDL) and (b) doubling
  time (DT) were analyzed at each passage. (C) The representative surface marker expression
  was detected by flow cytometry at passage 5. (D) Multilineage differentiation of
  UDSCs. (a) Adipogenic differentiation; Oil Red O staining for lipid droplets (Day
  21). (b) Osteogenic differentiation; Alizarin Red S staining for calcium deposits
  (Day 21). (c) Chondrogenic differentiation; Alcian Blue staining for glycosaminoglycan
  accumulation (Day 21). (E) PKH26-labeled UDSCs (red) were intravenously administered
  to wild-type (Sham) and ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) mice.
