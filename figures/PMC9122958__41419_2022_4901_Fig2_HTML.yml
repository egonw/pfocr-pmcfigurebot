figure_title: SNAIL levels are significantly upregulated with WNT5A overexpression
  and correlate with a poor prognosis
caption: A Western blots showing WNT5A levels in various ESCC cells. B Representative
  western blots showing the levels of FLAG-WNT5A, SNAIL, E-cadherin, SLUG, TWIST1,
  and vimentin in WNT5A-overexpressing cells. β-actin was used as an internal control.
  C Representative IHC images showing SNAIL expression in ESCC tissues. Scale bars,
  200 and 50 μm (inset). D Statistical analysis of SNAIL expression in 145 patients
  with ESCC based on the tissue microarray IHC results. E Kaplan–Meier survival analysis
  of 145 patients with ESCC presenting high/low SNAIL expression. F Correlation analysis
  of WNT5A and HDAC7 expression in ESCC tissues. G Comprehensive Kaplan–Meier survival
  analysis of 145 patients with ESCC presenting high/low WNT5A and SNAIL expression.
  LV lentivirus.
