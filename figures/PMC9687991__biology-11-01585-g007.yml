caption: Long-term 150 mT SMFs exposure regulated metabolism function in adult female
  mice. (A) Histogram generated from LEfSe analysis exhibits differential microbes’
  population in magnetic field treatment. Taxa enriched in microbiota from the Sham
  (blue), upward 150 mT SMF (red) or downward 150 mT SMF (green) groups were indicated
  with a positive LDA score, respectively (taxa with LDA score = 2 and significance
  of α < 0.05 determined by Wilcoxon signed- rank test). (B) PCoA analysis. (C) Metabolic
  pathway differences analysis between the upward 150 mT SMF and sham groups in adult
  female mice including methglyut-PWY, PWY-4984 and P461-PWY. (D) The relative abundance
  of genus Clostridium in PWY-4984. (E) Metabolic pathway differences analysis between
  the downward 150 mT SMF and sham groups in adult female mice. (F–H) The relative
  abundance of genus g_Bifidobacterium abundance in PWY1G-0, g_Ralstonia and g_Yaniella
  abundance in protocatechuate-ortho-cleavage-PWY and PWY-5180. “*” means p < 0.05.
