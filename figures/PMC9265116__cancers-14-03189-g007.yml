caption: The effect of gelsolin (GSN) and peroxiredoxin-4 (PRDX4) silencing on the
  activation of the EGFR/RhoA/PKCα/ERK pathway and expression of EMT markers in CRC.
  DLD-1 cells were transfected with lentiviral shRNA targeting GSN and PRDX4 (GSN
  shRNA and PRDX4 shRNA) or non-targeting control (Control shRNA). Whole-cell lysate
  proteins were prepared and analyzed by western blot, with β-actin serving as the
  loading control. Cell lysates were analyzed by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
  gel electrophoresis and subsequently treated with antibodies against phosphorylation
  of EGFR, RhoA, PKC PKCα, and ERK as well as twist 1/2, and cyclin D1. The protein
  levels were quantified through densitometric analysis with the ratio of the untreated
  control (control) set as 1-fold. The quantitative data are presented as the mean
  of three repeats from three independent experiments. * p < 0.05, compared with the
  control shRNA group (siControl).
