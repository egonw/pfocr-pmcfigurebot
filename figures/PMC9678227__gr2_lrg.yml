caption: 'XFBD attenuated C3a and C5a generation and the expressions of C3aR and C5aR.
  (A) Immunohistochemistry staining of C3a, C5a, C3aR and C5aR in lung tissues induced
  by IgG-IC. The nuclei were counter stained by Hematoxylin (magnification, ×200).
  (B) The contents of C3a and C5a in serum was measured by ELISA assay. (C) RT-PCR
  analysis of C3aR and C5aR in the lung tissues of different groups. (D) Western blot
  result of the expression of C3a, C5a, C3aR and C5aR in the lung tissues stimulated
  by IgG-IC. n=6, *p<0.05 compared with the control group; #p<0.05 compared with the
  anti-BSA group. $p<0.05 compared with the IgG-IC induced group.'
article_title: Xuanfei Baidu Decoction suppresses complement overactivation and ameliorates
  IgG immune complex-induced acute lung injury by inhibiting JAK2/STAT3/SOCS3 and
  NF-κB signaling pathway.
