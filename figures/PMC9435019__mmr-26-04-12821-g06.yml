caption: Effect of SDF-1α/CXCR4 signaling on the protein expression of ERK1/2 and
  PI3K pathway. (A) Representative results of ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2, PI3K and p-PI3K expression
  of HRECs were determined using western blotting. SDF-1α/CXCR4 signaling significantly
  increased the protein expression of ERK1/2 and PI3K pathway. (B) Statistical analysis
  of ratios of p-ERK1/2 and p-PI3K to GAPDH protein. (C) Statistical analysis of ratios
  of p-ERK1/2/total ERK1/2 and p-PI3K/total PI3K. All values represent mean ± standard
  error of the mean (n=3). *P<0.05 vs. control. SDF, stromal cell-derived factor;
  CXCR, chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor; p-phosphorylated; HRECs, human retinal endothelial
  cells.

  vascular endothelial cells by activating ERK1/2 and PI3K pathways in vitro.
