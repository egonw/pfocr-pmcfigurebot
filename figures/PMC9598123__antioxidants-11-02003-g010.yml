caption: Pro-Inflammatory Leukotrienes (LT) and Prostaglandins (PG) Metabolized from
  Arachidonic Acid (AA). Isoforms of phospholipase A2 have been reported to be activated
  by ROS []. phospholipase A2 cleaves AA from cell membrane phospholipids. AA is oxidized
  through the lipoxygenase pathway to yield leukotrienes, eicosanoid inflammatory
  mediators, which are released by macrophages and are involved in the inflammatory
  reactions []. LTB4 is a potent chemotactic agent. The prostaglandins are derived
  from AA and metabolized through the cyclooxygenase pathway. They are involved in
  the inflammatory response as well as other pathogenic mechanisms []. PGE2 is a potent
  pro-inflammatory PG and is involved in all the signs of inflammation, although it
  also can exert anti-inflammatory effects during neuroinflammation.
