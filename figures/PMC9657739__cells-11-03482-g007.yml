caption: 'Mifepristone inhibits in vitro migration in STAT3-dependent signalling.
  (A) Relative mRNA expression of Vimentin and CXCR4. (B) Immunofluorescence analysis
  of Vimentin expression. (C) Scratch wound healing assay. MIA PaCa-2 cell monolayers
  were scraped in a straight line using a p200 pipette tip; then, they were left untreated
  or primed with LIF 10 ng/mL alone or in combination with mifepristone 10 or 20 µM
  and EC359 25 nM. The wound generated was captured at 0 and 48 h of incubation with
  the compounds above described. The images show cell migration at the two times point
  indicated. (D) Images of obtained points were analysed, measuring scraped area and
  its closure vs. the first time point at 0 h. Results are the mean ± SEM of three
  samples per group (* represents statistical significance versus NT, and # versus
  LIF, p < 0.05). (E) Analysis of STAT3 signalling pathway. Representative Western
  blot analysis of STAT3 and phospho-STAT3, proteins in MIA-PaCa-2 cells exposed to
  LIF (10 nM) alone or in combination with increasing concentration of mifepristone
  (10, 20, 50 µM) for 20 min. (F) Densitometric analysis demonstrating phospho-STAT3/STAT3
  ratio.'
