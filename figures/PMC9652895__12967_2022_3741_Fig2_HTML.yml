caption: Celastrol induced apoptosis of human NSCLC Cells. A After treatment with
  celastrol at the indicated concentration for 24 h before staining with Annexin V
  and propidium iodide (PI), the distribution of apoptotic cells was determined using
  flow cytometry. B The apoptotic characteristics in NSCLC cell nucleus presented
  by Hoechst Staining assay. After treatment with celastrol for 12 h before staining
  with Hoechst staining, the nucleus was observed and photographed (100×). Representative
  results of triple experiments. C Caspase 3 activity was evaluated using the Caspase
  Assay Kit, and absorbance was recorded at 405 nm. (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001,
