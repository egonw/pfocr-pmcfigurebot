  analysis in PD and ALS cohorts to infer putative gene-gene interactions among P-body
  genes and SNCA. 53 P-body genes are grouped according to their functions. At the
  center, the causal genes are shown, SNCA for PD and TDP-43 for ALS. The map of significant
  SNP interactions (summarized at the gene level) with P-body genes and TDP-43 (TARDBP)
  (G) and SNCA (H) are shown. Protective and deleterious interactions are color coded.
  In (H), the LSM7 SNP GWAS genome-wide hit is indicated. Reduced opacity: The intra
  P-body interactions, High opacity: SNCA and P-body gene interactions.(G) Logic of
  RVTT analysis. Left: Traditional Burden test collapse all mutations irrespective
  of their frequency. Right: RVTT accounts for trends in qualifying-mutation proportions
  in case versus controls. Mega-gene represents all genes in the pathway. Orange dots
  are collapsed qualifying mutations.(H) Rare Variant Trend test (RVTT) analysis of
  P-body pathway genes In two different PD cohorts, PPMI and PDBP, RVTT was applied
  to P-body genes. Two “bags” of P-body genes were tested: CORE genes and DECAPPING
  genes, which are indicated in the lists. Three separate mutation-types (missense
  damaging, missense neutral and synonymous) were interrogated in both cohorts.'
