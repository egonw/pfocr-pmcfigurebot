caption: (A) Toc-Cim:p53 and Chol-Cim:p53 were transfected into CT-26 cells, and protein
  lysates were collected 48 h later. Western blot analysis used to assess the effects
  of Toc-Cim:p53, Chol-Cim:p53, and lipofectamine/p53 on the apoptosis signaling pathway.
  The protein levels were normalized using beta-actin; (B) ImageJ software was used
  to compute protein expression ratios compared to non-treated CT-26 cells from western
  blot data (n = 2).
