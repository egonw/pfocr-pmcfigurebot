caption: Regulation of hemocyte phagocytosis by the Hippo pathway. (A–C) Determination
  of the fluorescence signal gate of phagocytized bacteria in hemocytes by analyzing
  the unstained (A) and Dil-stained hemocytes (B) and FITC-labeled V. parahaemolyticus
  (Vpa, C) by flow cytometry. The phagocytic activity of hemocytes of dsRNA-GFP- (D),
  dsRNA-Hippo- (E), dsRNA-Wts- (F), and dsRNA-Yki-treated shrimp (G) were analyzed
  and statistically analyzed (H). **, p < 0.01 by two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test.
