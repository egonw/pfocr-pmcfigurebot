caption: (A) Biological “omics” cascade and the factors that govern them. Targeted
  metabolomics focuses on the measurements of endogenous small molecules as a by-product
  of a metabolic pathway, while global metabolomics focuses on the fluctuation patterns
  and attributes said pattern to a pathway. Fluctuations in the “omics” cascade (blue
  layer) can be due to the influence of exogenous non-genetic factors (red) and can
  lead to alterations in phenotypes. Global metabolomics analysis can aid in the enhanced
  understanding of biomarkers/pathways and their correlation with etiology and diagnosis
  (). (B) Workflow diagram highlighting the important milestones of the NMR and AI
  processes.
