caption: SerpinE2 activates the ERK1/2 signaling pathway in cardiac fibroblasts. A.
  Co-staining of p-ERK1/2 and serpinE2 in cardiac fibroblasts (n = 4, Scale bars =
  20 µm). B. Relative expression level of phosphate-ERK1/2 in cardiac fibroblasts
  after administration of serpinE2 antibody, heparin, nystatin or β-cyclodextrin (n=4);
  C. Expression level of ERK1 was detected by ELISA assay after administration of
  serpinE2 antibody, heparin, nystatin or β-cyclodextrin (n = 6); D. Collagen expression
  level in CFs after treated with U0126 (n = 5). Data are presented as mean ± SEM.
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, determined one-way ANOVA, Bonferroni's multiple
  comparisons test (B-D).
