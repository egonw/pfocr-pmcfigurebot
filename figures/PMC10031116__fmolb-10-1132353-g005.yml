caption: Integrin, Hippo and TGF-β signaling pathways mediate mechanical stress signaling
  to the cell. (A) TGF-β is secreted out of cells in an inactive form. Activated TGF-β
  can upregulate ECM stiffness through fibroblast activation. (B) Mechanical signals
  are involved in TGF-β activation.The interaction of activated TGF-β and TGFBR mediated
  the transmembrane transduction of ECM mechanical signals, which is transduced via
  two pathways, Smad and non-Smad, thereby regulating myofibroblast differentiation
  and the stiffness of the ECM. Integrins can signal through pathways such as FAK,
  ILK and Hippo, and there is crosstalk with the TGF-β pathway.
