caption: Immune and signaling pathways featured in high and low CSCR score subgroups.
  (a) Immune cells components and their proportion between high and low subgroups
  in the TCGA LIHC cohort. (b) Correlation analysis of proportion and CSCR score of
  22 immune cells. (c) The CSRS and immune cells had significantly close relationship.
  (d) The low CSRS subgroup was profoundly enriched in the P53 signal pathway, cell
  cycle, mismatch repair, homologous recombination, and DNA replication. ∗P < 0.05;
  ∗∗P < 0.01; ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
