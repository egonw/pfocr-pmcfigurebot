caption: 'The s741 mutation causes mislocalization of Furinb, which triggers endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) stress. (A) Gene‐set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identified gene sets
  that were significantly altered in s741 mutant livers with nominal p value < 0.05
  and false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.01. Gene sets were ranked by normalized enrichment
  score (NES). (B) GSEA plot shows a significant enrichment of unfolded protein response
  (UPR) pathway in s741 mutant livers compared with WT livers. (C–F) TEM images of
  hepatocytes (C,E) and biliary cells (D,F). Biliary cells are outlined by orange
  dashed line in (D) and (F). (D'') and (F'') show the boxed areas in (D) and (F)
  under high magnification. Arrows in (E) and (F'') point to dilated ER. Three WT
  and three mutants were examined. Scale bar: 1 μm. (G,H) Confocal single‐plane images
  showing the expression of WT and s741 mutant Furinb‐GFP (fb‐GFP) fusion proteins
  in the biliary cells marked by Tg(Tp1:ras‐mCherry) expression. Sixteen WT‐fb‐GFP
  fish and 25 mut‐fb‐GFP fish from three rounds of injection were examined, and all
  had the representative protein localization. Scale bar: 10 μm. (I) Numbers (mean ± SEM)
  of hepatic cysts as revealed by Tg(Tp1:GFP) expression in the larvae after treatments
  with 10 μmol/L 4‐4‐phenylbutyric acid (4‐PBA), 1 μg/mL tunicamycin (TM), or both
  from 72 hpf to 120 hpf. Each dot represents an individual liver. Statistical significance
  was calculated by one‐way ANOVA and Tukey''s post‐hoc test: *p < 0.05; ***p < 0.001;
  ****p < 0.0001. ES, enrichment score; G, glycogen; M, mitochondria; N, nucleus.'
