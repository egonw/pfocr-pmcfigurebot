caption: SUMO E3 ligases in the regulation of the hallmarks of cancer. SUMO E3s are
  involved in cancers by regulating many cellular processes, including the p53 localization,
  transcription activity, PI3K/AKT signaling, PML protein stability, DNA damage repair,
  and metastasis. Representative SUMO E3 ligases with their best-defined substrates
  in these processes are listed. In the p53 signaling pathway, the ligases with green
  color represent promotion, and those with red color represent inhibition.
