caption: Function analysis of differentially expressed protein-coding genes. (A) KEGG
  pathway analysis of DEGs between LD vs. LE comparison. (B) KEGG pathway analysis
  of DEGs between MD vs. ME comparison. (C) Overview of the DEGs and pathways related
  to follicular development and estrus expression between LD vs. LE comparison. (D)
  Overview of the DEGs and pathways related to follicular development and estrus expression
  between MD vs. ME comparison. (E) Overlap analysis of the genes that related to
  follicular development and estrus expression between LD vs. LE and MD vs. ME comparisons.
  (F) PPI network of the genes that related to follicular development and estrus expression
  between LD vs. LE and MD vs. ME comparisons. The size of the circle represents the
  degree of interaction between the genes.
