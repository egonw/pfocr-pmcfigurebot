figure_title: Figure 3.Gene expression alterations associated with exogenous TGF-ß
  treatment
caption: PB-and CB-derived NK cells were cultured in the absence and presence of TGF-ß
  for 5 days. The cells were then analyzed by qPCR to determine the change in NK cells
  effector function in response to TGF-ß treatment. (A-D) Expression results are presented
  as a hierarchical cluster heat map. Each row denotes a parameter, and each column
  denotes a cell culture condition, as indicated. The color scale indicates relative
  protein abundance as determined by fold change. Dendrograms denote the Euclidean
  distances between clustered conditions. (A) NK cell Activation pathway genes. (B.)
  NK cell Inhibition pathway genes. (C.) Cytokines and Lytic enzymes pathway genes
  (D.) NK cell effector function pathways. (E-H) Mean Gene expression change in NK
  cells in presence of TGF-ß relative to NK cells in absence of TGF-ß is shown in
  fold change (y axis). (E.) NK cell effector function pathways. (F.) NK cell Inhibition
  pathway genes. (G.) Cytokines and Lytic enzymes pathway genes (H.) NK cell Activation
  pathway genes. PB-derived NK cells are represented by black box, CB-derived NK cells
  are represented by red box and whisker extends from min to max value. Each dot represents
  individual donor. For gene annotation see abbreviation section. For gene annotation
  see abbreviation section.
