caption: The crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis. (1) Atg5, Atg12, and Atg16L
  combine to form a complex, activating LC3-I to LC3-II. Then LC3-II fuses with the
  autophagic outer membrane to promote the development of autophagy. In addition,
  the unconjugated Atg5 is cleaved by calpain, and its product, Atg5tN, naturally
  enters the mitochondria. Subsequently, in the mitochondria, Atg5tN mediates the
  release of Cyt-c by interacting with BCL-2 proteins, thereby promoting apoptosis.
  Full-length Atg4D promotes apoptosis, and ΔN63 Atg4D gains GABARAP-L1 coupling autophagy
  with apoptosis; (2) The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway can inhibit both autophagy and apoptosis;
  (3) Beclin-1 in the endoplasmic reticulum can promote the occurrence of autophagy,
  but when combined with Bcl-2, it can inhibit autophagy. The cleaved Beclin-1 by
  Caspase-3 can be translocated to mitochondria, triggering apoptosis; (4) p53 in
  mitochondria can combine with Bcl-2 to promote apoptosis. p53 in the nucleus promotes
  autophagy through the mTOR pathway, and p53 in the cytoplasm inhibits autophagy
  by interacting with FIP200. (5) Deletion of ATG5 and ATG3 inhibits autophagy and
  apoptosis, and caspase-3 cleaves Beclin-1 to promote apoptosis. ↑ induce; ⟂ inhibit.
