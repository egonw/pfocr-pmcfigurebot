caption: (A) Effect of Cd augmentation on H2O2, O2, and cell death in rice. Accumulation
  of    and H2O2 was measured in wild-type and osaux1-3 mutant exposed to 200 µM of
  CdCl2 for 7 days. Cell death was also assessed after days of wild-type and osaux1-3
  by Evans Blue staining exposed to 200 µM of CdCl2 for 7 days. (B) Histochemical
  detection of (B) cereus-inoculated and noninoculated wild-type and osaux1-3 root
  tips exposed to 200 µM of CdCl2 with Hoechst 33342 staining image was visualized
  after 7 days of stress using Nikon Eclipse DS Ri2 microscope. Scale bars = 2µm.
  (C) Cultural staining of (B) cereus with Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide in the
  presence of Cd. The bacterial culture was grown in an LB medium with 108 CFU. Lowercase
  letters indicate significant differences between means, determined using Duncan’s
  multiple range mean comparisons.

  in rice by interacting with the indole-3-acetic acid–amido synthetase gene, promoting
  root hair development under cadmium stress.
