caption: 'Nogo-A regulates malignant behaviors and stemness in U87-CSCs via Nogo-A/NgR
  signaling pathway. (A) GFP signal in vector was imaged to confirm the successful
  transfection of shScrambled or shNogo-A (left panel). Nogo-A was detected to confirm
  the knockdown efficacy of Nogo-A protein level (right panel). *P<0.05, vs. shScrambled.
  (B) After Nogo-A knockdown or inhibition of Nogo-A/NgR signaling pathway, cell viability
  from day 1 to 5 was measured by CCK-8. (C) Cell cycle distribution was measured
  by PI staining followed by flow cytometry. *P<0.05 vs. shScrambled; #P<0.05 vs.
  mock. (D) Serial replating assays were measured from passage 1 to 3. *P<0.05 vs.
  shScrambled; #P<0.05 vs. mock. (E) Transwell assays were performed. *P<0.05 vs.
  shScrambled. #P<0.05 vs. mock. (F) Tumor formation was performed in soft agar. GFP,
  green fluorescent protein; Nogo-A, neurite outgrowth inhibitor A; CCK-8, Cell Counting
  Kit-8; NgR, Nogo Receptor. CSCs, cancer stem cells; PI, propidium iodide.'
