caption: Metabolite enrichment analysis using MetaboAnalyst. (A) Quantitative enrichment
  analysis overview of the enriched metabolite sets derived from the quantified metabolites
  of parental and PTX-res cells based on the KEGG pathways library. The dashed line
  represents the cut-off for the significantly enriched metabolite sets in the PTX-res
  cells (p < 0.05 and FDR < 0.1). (B) Table that summarizes the KEGG metabolism-related
  pathways that were found enriched in the PTX-res cells. Match status indicates the
  number of metabolites found in our data vs. the number of metabolites in the library
  related to a specific pathway. (C) Concentration levels of the metabolites associated
  with the pathways presented in (B) in parental and PTX-res cells (M; metabolism).
