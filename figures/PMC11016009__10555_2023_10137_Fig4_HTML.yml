caption: Role of B7-H3 on the plasticity of immune cells in shaping TME. B7-H3 are
  abnormally high in cancer cells and are inducible in some immune cells like antigen-presenting
  cells (APCs) and macrophages. TAM (tumor-associated macrophage) is the predominantly
  occurring immune cell in TME, and B7-H3 receptors are highly expressed on TAM. B7-H3
  in the cancer cells drives the phenotypic transformation of M1 to M2 macrophage
  in the TME, favoring altered immune function and suppression. The autocrine action
  of TGF-β1 increased the expression of miR155 while downregulating the expression
  of miR143 in CRC and T-lymphocytes exposed to TGF-β loses their capability to kill
  neoplastic cells []. Also, TGF-β1 increased the proliferation of immunosuppressive
  Treg cells. The immunomodulatory action of B7-H3 limits the proliferation and function
  of CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes through the inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B
  (NF-κB). Furthermore, B7-H3 inhibits NK cell antitumor activity. Vδ2T, a subset
  of T-lymphocytes with increased cancer cell killing capacity [], is attenuated by
  enhanced expression of B7-H3 molecule expressed on cancer cells via a molecular
  pathway involving Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3/UL16 binding
  protein 2 (STAT3/ULBP2) signaling []. B7-H3-induced cytokine (IL-2, IL-6, IL-17)
  secretion by T-lymphocytes generates a conducive niche for immune suppression /immune
  evasion favoring CRC progression. Created with BioRender.com
