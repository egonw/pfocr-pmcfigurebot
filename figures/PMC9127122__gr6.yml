caption: The effects of macrophage immune microenvironment on the immune function
  of fibroblasts. A) Leading terms analysis reveals the upregulation of granulocyte
  migration. B) Hub gene analysis reveals enrichment of various chemokines for innate
  immune. C) Leading terms analysis shows the most significant enrichment of regulation
  of innate immune response. D) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) analysis confirms
  the upregulated event of regulation of innate immune response. E) KEGG analysis
  reveals cytokine-related signaling pathway in M1 group. F) Hub gene analysis of
  the term of innate immune response. G) RT–qPCR confirms the upregulation of chemokines,
  inflammatory factors, and innate immune genes in M1 group. H) Leading term analysis
  reveals IFN, chemokines, TNF and IL-1 possibly contributed to fibroblasts' immune
  function in M1 group. I) Correlation analysis between up-regulated cytokines of
  M1 immune microenvironment and up-regulated immune-related genes of fibroblast.
  Data are presented as means ± SD; *p < 0.05.
