caption: Overexpression of LAPTM5 is associated with a poor outcome of breast cancer.
  (A) LAPTM5 mRNA level in healthy tissue, tumor-adjacent tissue and tumor was detected
  by bc-GenExMiner. (B) Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was used to examine
  the mRNA expression level of LAPTM5 on breast cancer tissues (n=40) and para-tumor
  tissues (n=40). Data are presented as the mean ± SD. (C-K) Raincloud plot indicating
  the association between LAPTM5 and clinical parameters. (L) The relationship between
  LAPTM5 and overall survival of patients with breast cancer. **P<0.01. LAPTM5, lysosomal
  protein transmembrane 5.
article_title: LAPTM5 regulated by FOXP3 promotes the malignant phenotypes of breast
  cancer through activating the Wnt/β‑catenin pathway.
