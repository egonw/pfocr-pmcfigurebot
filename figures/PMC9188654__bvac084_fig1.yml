caption: 'ucOCN mitigates the expression of TNF-α-induced IL-1β in C2C12 cells. C2C12
  cells were pretreated with ucOCN (0.5, 5, or 50 ng/mL) for 30 minutes. The cells
  were then treated with TNF-α (10 ng/mL) for 8, 24, and 48 hours. The mRNA (A-C)
  and protein levels (D-F) of IL-1β were analyzed using real-time PCR and Western
  blot, respectively. (G-I) Quantification of the Western blot bands. (J-K) Primary
  myoblasts were pretreated with ucOCN (0.5, 5, or 50 ng/mL) for 30 minutes. The cells
  were then treated with TNF-α (10 ng/mL) for 8 and 48 hours. The mRNA (J) and protein
  levels (K) of IL-1β were analyzed using real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively.
  (L) Quantification of the Western blot bands. β-Actin was used as a loading control.
  Data represent the mean ± SD of triplicates. *P < 0.05 compared to CON; #P < 0.05
  compared to TNF-α.'
