caption: HMGA2 knockdown inhibits the AKT/mTOR/P70S6K pathway. (A) Western blotting
  was used to measure the expression of AKT, mTOR and P70S6K phosphorylation in gastric
  cancer cells following HMGA2 knockdown. Quantification of (B) AKT, (C) mTOR and
  (D) P70S6K phosphorylation in gastric cancer cells following HMGA2 knockdown. Experiments
  were performed in triplicate. ***P<0.001 vs. Si-NC group. HMGA2, high mobility group
  A2; P70S6K, P70S6 kinase; WT, wild type; 5-FU, 5-fluorouracil; si, small interfering.
article_title: lncRNA HIT000218960 enhances resistance to 5-fluorouracil by promoting
  HMGA2 and activating the AKT/mTOR/P70S6K pathway in gastric cancer cells.
