caption: Effect of the interference of genes closely associated with the heme synthesis
  pathway on Shewanella strains. a Growth curve of interfered strains compared to
  that of wild-type MR-1 in LB medium. b Analysis of important amino acids by HPLC
  at 12Â h. The genes repressed in MR-1 are indicated. Gln glutamine, His histidine,
  Ser serine, Thr threonine, Gly glycine, Asn asparagine, Glu glutamate, Arg arginine
