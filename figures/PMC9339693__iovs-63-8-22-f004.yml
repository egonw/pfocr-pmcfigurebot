caption: RhoA and ROCK1 were activated under high-glucose conditions. (A, B) Flow
  cytometry was used to assess the apoptosis of mRMVECs treated with different concentrations
  of glucose (30, 60, or 90 mM) or mannitol (30, 60, or 90 mM) control for 48 hours.
  (C) The CCK-8 assay was used to determine the viability of mRMVECs. (D) ELISA was
  used to measure the levels of inflammatory factors in the cell supernatant. (E)
  qRT–PCR was used to measure the mRNA expression of RhoA, ROCK1, ROCK2, and Cx43
  after exposure to different concentrations of glucose or mannitol. (F, G) Western
  blotting was used to assess the protein expression of RhoA, ROCK1, ROCK2, and Cx43
  after exposure to different concentrations of glucose or mannitol for 48 hours.
  ns, no significance. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001 compared
  with the control group. N = 3. The bars are the mean ± SD.
