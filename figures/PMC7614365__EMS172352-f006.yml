figure_title: Dynamic spatial identity mapping of Epi- and Am-spheroid cultures
caption: A, 3D reconstruction of the CS6 marmoset embryo (Bergmann et al., 2021) highlighting
  the EmDisc and amnion. Additional lineages are displayed in low opacity for context.
  B, Representative gene expression patterns depicted in Gaussian process regression-based
  3D models of CS6 EmDisc and amnion. Expression patterns demarcate anterior EmDisc,posterior
  EmDisc, and spatial domains of the amnion. C-D, Comparison of Epi-spheroids (C)
  and Am-spheroids (D) to the embryo through static spatial identity mapping and comparative
  ternary plots. Spatial identity mapping colour scale represents projection of correlation
  values onto embryo model surfaces followed by Gaussian process regression mapping.
  Ternary plots display proportional mRNA levels of lineage markers given by distance
  to the vertex. E-J, Dynamic spatial identity and comparative ternary plots for indicated
  screen conditions with MEF (E-G) or without MEF (H-J). In ternary plots, arrow origin
  denotes levels in control spheroids, and arrow endpoint denotes levels when indicated
  signalling pathway perturbation is applied.
article_title: Microgel culture and spatial identity mapping elucidate the signalling
  requirements for primate epiblast and amnion formation.
