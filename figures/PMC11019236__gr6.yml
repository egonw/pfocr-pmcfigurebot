caption: 'Identification of gene co-expression modules among myeloid cell 2. A: Weighed
  gene co-expression network analysis was constructed among myeloid cell 2. B: Dot
  plot of the KEGG functional enrich analysis of the module. C: The first 8 eigengenes
  of each module, ranked by eigengene-based connectivity (kME). D: Bubble diagram
  demonstrating the relevance of the m5c gene to the pathway in myeloid cells 2. E:
  Scatterplot demonstrating the correlation between YBX1 and the pathway in myeloid
  cells 2. F: Lollipop chart of correlations between YBX1 and genes in epithelial
  mesenchymal transition pathway in myeloid cells 2. G: Lollipop chart of correlations
  between YBX1 and genes in TNF-alpha signaling via NF-ÎºB in myeloid cells 2.'
