caption: Cell cycle is affected by inhibitors of PI3K/mTOR pathway. (A) FCM analysis
  of cultured Hep-2 and AMC-HN-8 cells. (B) Cell cycle analysis of the Hep-2 and AMC-HN-8
  cell lines. Cells in G2/M phase were increased by NVP-BEZ235 in both cell lines.
  Columns, means of duplicate measurements; bars, ± SD. (C) Western blotting analysis
  of the expression levels of cyclin D1 and cyclin E2 in two cell lines treated with
  three different PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. Cyclin D1 and cyclin E2 decreased significantly
  after treatment with NVP-BEZ235. (D,E) The expression levels were evaluated by ImageJ
  and analyzed with 2way ANOVA; bars, ± SD; **, P<0.001. FCM, flow cytometric.
