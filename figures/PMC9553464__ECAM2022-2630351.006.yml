caption: Depletion of KRT80 hinders xenograft tumorigenesis of NSCLC. (a) The representative
  representation of tumor nodules. (b) Tumor volume alteration curves in mice. (c)
  Statistical data of tumor weights of mice. (d) Levels of KRT80, Ki-67, and TGFBR1
  in tissue sections of mice tumors were detected using an immunohistochemistry assay
  (top, bottom panel; scale bar = 100, 50 μm).  ∗ ∗P < 0.01 and  ∗ ∗ ∗P < 0.001.
