caption: 'Schematic diagram representation of the proposed mechanisms whereby treatment
  with the TGF-β1R antagonist GW788388 inhibits the development of cardiac fibrosis
  and remodeling in Npr1 gene-ablated mutant mice: disruption of Npr1 gene leads to
  an unbalanced activation of TGF-β1 signaling cascade that triggers the expression
  of fibrotic markers, thereby activating the specific molecular and structural changes
  leading to fibrosis and hypertrophic remodeling in a mutant mouse heart. Treatment
  with the TGF-β1 receptor antagonist GW788388 ameliorates by blocking the activation
  and nuclear translocation of SMAD-mediated signaling networks, which protects against
  fibrosis and hypertrophic remodeling in 0-copy and 1-copy mutant mice hearts.'
