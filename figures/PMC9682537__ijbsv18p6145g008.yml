caption: A schematic diagram for the role of YTHDF1 in prostate cancer progression.
  ELK1 directly interacts with the promoter region of YTHDF1 to regulate the transcriptional
  activation of YTHDF1. Dysregulated YTHDF1 promotes PLK1 translational efficiency
  by recognizing and directly binding to m6A modification of the 3Ê¹UTR region of PLK1
  mRNA, thereby regulating the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and contributing
  to prostate cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis.

  the translation of Polo-like kinase 1 in an m6A dependent manner.
