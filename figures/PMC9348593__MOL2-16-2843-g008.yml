caption: 'High expression of PGAM1 in BC significantly correlated with poor prognosis.
  (A) The mRNA expression levels of PGAM1 were analyzed in BC or control group from
  TCGA databases. (B) OS rate and (C) DFS rate analysis of the BC patients from TCGA
  databases. (D) Representative images of PGAM1 with different IHC staining scores
  (n = 83, scale bar: 100 μm). (E) Kaplan–Meier analysis of the OS and (F) DFS in
  BC patients (n = 83). Data was analyzed by t‐test (A) or Kaplan–Meier method (E,
  F), and was shown as mean ± SD. ****P < 0.0001.'
