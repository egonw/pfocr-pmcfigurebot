caption: 'NT5DC2 is upregulated in DLBC cells and knockdown of NT5DC2 inhibits proliferation
  of DLBC cells. (A) mRNA and protein expression levels of NT5DC2 in human B lymphocyte
  (GM12878) and DLBC cell lines were detected by RT-qPCR and western blotting. *P<0.05,
  **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs. GM12878. (B) mRNA and protein expression levels of NT5DC2
  in OCI-Ly7 cells transfected with shRNA-NT5DC2 were confirmed by RT-qPCR and western
  blotting. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs. Control; ##P<0.01 and ###P<0.001
  vs. shRNA-NC; ∆P<0.05 vs. shRNA-NT5DC2 #1. (C) Viability of OCI-Ly7 cells transfected
  with shRNA-NT5DC2 was analyzed by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. *P<0.05 and ***P<0.001
  vs. Control; #P<0.05 and ###P<0.001 vs. shRNA-NC. (D) Proliferation of OCI-Ly7 cells
  transfected with shRNA-NT5DC2 was observed by BrdU staining. NT5DC2, 5′-nucleotidase
  domain-containing 2; DLBC, diffuse large B-cell carcinoma; RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; NC, negative control; BrdU, 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine;
  OD, optical density.'
article_title: Decreased RNA-binding protein IGF2BP2 downregulates NT5DC2, which suppresses
  cell proliferation, and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in diffuse large
  B-cell lymphoma cells by regulating the p53 signaling pathway.
