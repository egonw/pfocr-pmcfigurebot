caption: Growth and immune evasion of EBV-mediated NPC. Typical pathway for EBV infection
  and cellular transformation (top). Mechanisms of EBV-mediated cellular transformation
  and immune evasion (bottom). EBV alters immune checkpoints, including TIM-3 and
  TRIM29 []. The virus also alters the immune system via modulation of NFkB. []. EBV-specific
  products LMP1 [] and LMP2 [] also alter the cell cycle and aid in immune evasion
  []. Figure generated using BioRender.
