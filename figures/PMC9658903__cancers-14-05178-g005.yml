caption: P. acnes promotes tumour growth by increasing the inflammatory response to
  activate the Hh signalling pathway. Proinflammatory cytokines (A) TNF-α, (B) IL-1β,
  and (C) IL-6 were detected in tumour tissues at the gene level by q-PCR. (D) H&E
  staining images of tumour tissues were presented; the bar represents 50 μm. (E)
  Immunohistochemistry of Gli1 expression was determined in EOC of mice; bar represents
  50 μm. (F) Western blot analysis of Shh, Smo, Ptch1, Gli1, and Gli2 expression in
  tumour tissues; β-actin was used as an internal control (n = 3). The relative expressions
  of (G) Shh, (H) Smo, (I) Ptch1, (J) Gli1, and (K) Gli2 were quantified by Image
  J. Three mice were randomly selected in each group. Data are presented as means
  ± SD. One-way repeated measures ANOVA with Tukey’s test for multiple comparisons;
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.
