caption: 'Adropin alleviates vascular calcification in vivo. (a)–(c) The protein expression
  levels of calcification-associated markers (ALP, OPG, OCN, SM22, Runx2, and α-SMA)
  in rat vascular tissues were quantified using western blotting. GAPDH was used as
  the loading control. Each experiment was performed three times, and data are presented
  as the mean ± SD. ALP: alkaline phosphatase; OPG: osteoprotegerin; OCN: osteocalcin;
  SM22: smooth muscle protein 22; Runx2: runt-related transcription factor 2; α-SMA:
  α-smooth muscle actin. ∗p < 0.05 compared to control. #p < 0.05 compared to the
  model+saline group.'
