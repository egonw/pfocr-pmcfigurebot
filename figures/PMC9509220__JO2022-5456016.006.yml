caption: miR-187 targets PDLIM1. (a) The Starbase database (http://starbase.sysu.edu.cn/)
  forecast the binding target of PDLIM1 and miR-187. (b, c) Dual luciferase activity
  assay and RIP corroborated the binding relationship between PDLIM1 and miR-187.
  (d) The coexpressed genes of miR-187 in GC (LindOmics). The heat maps exhibited
  the positively and negatively coexpressed Top-50 genes of miR-187 in GC. (e) PDLIM1
  was negatively correlated with miR-187 in GC. (f) RT-qPCR confirmed PDLIM1 expression
  in MKN-45 cells. ns P > 0.05, ∗∗∗P < 0.001. N = 3.
