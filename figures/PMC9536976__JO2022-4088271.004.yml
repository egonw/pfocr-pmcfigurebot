caption: RNA sequencing reveals that NEAT1 regulates colorectal cancer through inflammatory
  response. (a) The expression pattern of Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient
  of two groups. (b) Volcanic map was used to show the different genes between the
  two groups. (c) Hierarchical clustering was used to show the different genes between
  the two groups. (d) The differential genes of all comparison groups by two-way cluster
  analysis. (e) The heat map of different signal pathway genes expression. (f) KEGG
  enrichment analysis of the differential genes. (g) Relative expression of genes
  in CRC cell lines by qRT-PCR. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01. The data are expressed as the
  mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Unpaired two-tailed Student's t test
  between two groups was applied.
