caption: 'Tumor cell-derived sEV mediates CRC progression in vivo. HCT8-HM: Author
  team establishes CRC cell lines with high metastatic potential; HCT8-HM-EXO: sEV
  secreted by HCT8-HM cells; HCT8-HM-si-circCOG2-EXO: sEV extracted after knockdown
  of circCOG2 in HCT8-HM cells. (A) From top to bottom group 1, group 2, and group
  3 were treated with PBS, HCT8-HM-EX, O, and HCT8-HM-si-circCOG2-EXO respectively
  in nude mice transplanted tumor models. (B) The tumor excised after 4 weeks. (C)
  Tumor volume is measured weekly. (D) Tumor weight is measured weekly. After treatment
  with tumor cell-derived sEV, tumor volume, and weight increased significantly, and
  this may have been caused by the delivery of circCOG2. Reprinted from Gao L, Tang
  X, He Q, Sun G, Wang C, Qu H. sEVs-transmitted circCOG2 promotes CRC progression
