figure_title: Identification of integrin beta 1 in ALL cells mediating the adhesion
  to MSCs
caption: (A) Functional CRISPR-Cas9 library screening of cell adhesion genes implicated
  in adhesion of ALL cells to MSCs. NALM6 cells transduced with lentivirus expressing
  Cas9 and gRNAs that target 285 genes, adhesome (232 genes) and TGFβ pathway (53
  genes), were co-cultured with MSCs, and then Nonadh and Adh NALM6 cells were collected
  for sequencing and MAGeCK analysis.(B) Volcano plots displaying the log fold change
  on the X axis and −log10 p value in Y axis for all sgRNAs identified in Nonadh NALM6
  (left panel) and Adh NALM6 (right panel).(C) Venn diagram showing number of genes
  that are either depleted or enriched genes in both Nonadh and Adh NALM6.(D) Cell
  adhesion assay of NALM6 cells to MSCs in the presence of P5D2 or AIIB2 (n = 3).
  Data, mean ± SD.(E) Cell adhesion assay of 697 and REH to MSCs in the presence of
  AIIB2 (n = 3). Data, mean ± SD.(F) Cell adhesion assay of ITGB1 KO NALM6 clones
  to MSCs (n = 3). Data, mean ± SD.(G) Cell adhesion assay of NALM6 cells to MSCs
  in the presence of blocker of either 25 μM ATN-161 or BIO-1211 (n = 3). Data, mean
  ± SD.(H) TEM of integrin β1 in NALM6 co-cultured with MSCs. White arrows, integrin
  β1 localized at the synapse between NALM6 and MSCs. Scale bars represent 2 μm. Student’s
  t test compared to WT or no treatment of Adh leukemic cells, ****p < 0.0001, ***p
  < 0.0005, **p < 0.005, *p < 0.05. See also .
