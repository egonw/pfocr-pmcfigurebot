caption: Key gene selection for herpesvirus latency-mediated stroke occurrence. (A)
  Venn diagram of the intersection of important module genes identified by WGCNA and
  differentially expressed genes from wild-type and mutant herpesvirus infection.
  (B) ROC curve analysis of the expression of OTUD1, NFIL3, and OSM genes in relation
  to stroke disease occurrence. Con (n = 20) represents the control group samples,
  and IS (n = 20) represents the stroke group samples. (C) Boxplots of differential
  expression of OTUD1 in brain tissue infected with wild-type and mutant herpesvirus.
  MOCK (n = 3) represents mock-infected brain tissue samples, MHV-68 (n = 3) represents
  wild-type herpesvirus-infected brain tissue samples, and ORF73 (n = 3) represents
  mutant herpesvirus-infected brain tissue samples.
