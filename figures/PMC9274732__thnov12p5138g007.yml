caption: Correlation between molecular feature and drug sensitivity reveals subsets-specific
  agents for KRAS-Mut colorectal cancer. (A) Dot plot showing the differences of gene
  dependencies between KM1 and KM2 groups. The genes with statistically different
  dependency scores in each subset are highlighted in blue (M1), and red (M2), respectively.
  Genes with FDR<0.05 are shown in the dot plot. Right shows the dependency scores
  for subset specific genes. (B) KRAS subgroup specific genes with dependency scores
  less than -0.3 were shown. (C) Three drug sensitivity databases (CTRP-V2, PRISM,
  GDSC1) were used to identify the sensitive of KM1 and KM2 cell line subsets to specific
  agents. Agents with lower AUC values on the x-axis of boxplots imply greater drug
  sensitivity. (D) Identification of most promising therapeutic agents for KM1 and
  KM2 subtype patients according to the evidence from multiple sources. (E) Scheme
  of signaling cascade and drug targets that are modulated in KRAS-Mut subtypes. The
  lower left panel displays the cell-cycle and checkpoints pathway that is dysregulated
  in KM1 patients and the lower right panel displays the epithelial-mesenchymal transition
  pathway that is dysregulated in KM2 patients.
