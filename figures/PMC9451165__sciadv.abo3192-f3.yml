figure_title: Elevated exercise-induced infiltration of skeletal muscle by immune
  cells in individuals with type 2 diabetes
caption: (A) Overrepresentation analysis using Fisher’s exact test on pro- and anti-inflammatory
  genes signatures. (B) Signaling pathway impact analysis (SPIA). (C) Representative
  images of skeletal muscle labeled with CD11b. (D) Quantification of the number of
  immune cells per myofiber performed with ImageJ. Data are means ± SE and individual
  data points, n = 3 to 5. Two-way ANOVA (exercise and type 2 diabetes) and pairwise
  t tests. (E) Macrophage markers and inflammatory pathways analyzed by Western blotting.
  Representative blots. (F and G) Western blot quantifications. Data are means ± SE
  and individual data points, n = 8 to 10. Two-way ANOVA (exercise and type 2 diabetes)
  and pairwise t tests. a.u., arbitrary units.
