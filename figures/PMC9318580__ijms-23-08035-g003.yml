caption: 'Effects of Zn2+ on autophagy–lysosome and apoptosis pathways in mice. Autophagy–lysosome
  pathway ((a), representative pictures; (b–e), quantification): the expression levels
  of LAMP-1 (a,b), LAMP-2a (a,c), P62 (a,d), LC3 I and LC3 II ((a,e) quantification
  of ratio of LC3II to LC3I) were determined through Western blot analysis using β-actin
  as an internal control. Apoptosis pathway ((f), representative pictures; (g–k),
  quantification): the p-ERK1 (f,g), p-ERK2 (f,h), p-p38 (f,i), cleaved caspase 3
  (f,k) levels and the total protein levels of ERK1/2, p38, caspase 3 and expression
  levels of cytochrome C (f,j) were determined using Western blotting with β-actin
  as an internal control. Data are represented as the means ± SEM of at least three
  independent experiments (n = 6). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 with respect to the control
  group.'
