caption: 'miR-29b inhibits the growth of NSCLC tissues in mice. (a) The change trend
  in mouse body weight. (b) miR-29b inhibited the growth of NSCLC tissue. (c) miR-29b
  inhibited the expression of FEM1B in mouse NSCLC tissue. (d) miR-29b inhibits TNF
  in tumor tissues of NSCLC mice and VEGF to promote the expression of IL-10. ∗P ≤
  0.05, comparison between the miR-29b group and NC-A549 group; #P ≤ 0.05, comparison
  between the NC-A549 group and control group.'
