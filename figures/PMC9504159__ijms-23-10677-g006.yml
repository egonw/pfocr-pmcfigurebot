caption: 'Identification of target genes of second-line treatment with anti-CTLA-4
  Ab combined with CC-02 or Regorafenib/Cabozantinib plus Chidamide-k30 that significantly
  regulates gene expression in TME of CT26 tumor-bearing mice. Tumors were analyzed
  on day 12 after starting second-line treatment for gene expression by RNA-seq. (A)
  Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes obtained by RNA-seq analysis in treated
  CT26 tumors compared to IgG control tumors. Significantly upregulated or downregulated
  genes are plotted in red and blue points, respectively. (B) Meta-enrichment analysis
  summary for significantly upregulated and downregulated genes was indicated by display
  of categories of related pathways and the number of affected genes of the corresponding
  pathway. The pathways highlighted with red color were related to the gene expression
  signatures in (C–G). (C–G) show results of gene expression related to response to
  INF-γ, cellular response to INF-γ, leukocyte migration, cell chemotaxis, adaptive
  immune response, and angiogenesis being analyzed. (C) GSEA enrichment analysis of
  tumors treated with anti-CTLA-4. (D) GSEA enrichment analysis of tumors treated
  with CC-02. (E) GSEA enrichment analysis of tumors treated with anti-CTLA-4 + CC-02.
  (F) GSEA enrichment analysis of tumors treated with anti-CTLA-4 + Cab + CD-k30.
  (G) GSEA enrichment analysis of tumors treated with anti-CTLA-4 + Reg + CD-k30.
  NES: normalized enrichment score; FDR: false discovery rates. Signature scores were
  calculated by mean log2 (TPM) of their respective member genes; p-values: Mann-Whitney
  test, two-tailed. When p ≧ 0.05, the GSEA analysis panel(s) is outlined with a red
  dotted line. When gene expression was downregulated, the GSEA analysis panel(s)
  is outlined with a blue solid line.'
