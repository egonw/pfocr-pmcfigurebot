figure_title: MAYA detects pathway activation in tumors across patients
caption: 'a UMAP representation of activity matrix of Hallmark pathways, cells are
  colored according to author annotation and patient. Clusters derived from activity
  matrix are displayed next to relevant groups of cells. b Overlaid jitter and boxplot
  representation of Shannon Diversity Index (SDI), for clusters derived from gene-based
  dimensionality reduction and MAYA activity matrix of the ovary dataset. Clusters
  corresponding to tumor cells are colored in pink; n = 11 and 4 independent clusters
  respectively; Center line, median; box limits, upper and lower quartiles; whiskers,
  1.5× interquartile range. c Barplot representation of specificity scores of the
  top5 specific modes for the four most prevalent populations in the dataset. d Heatmap
  of activity scores of the three modes of the Hallmark Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition
  (EMT) pathway, initial author annotation is indicated above heatmap. Heatmap of
  scaled gene expression for top10 contributing genes for the three modes of EMT,
  ordered by decreasing contribution. e UMAP representation of activity matrix of
  Hallmark pathways, cells are colored according to activity scores of the three EMT
  modes. Specificity score of cell populations is displayed next to relevant clusters.
  Violin plots of activity scores for corresponding modes, grouped by author annotation
  (adjusted p-values from two-sided Wilcoxon test are symbolized with: *: <0.05, **:
  <0.01, ***: <0.001, ****: <0.0001). Heatmap of the activity scores for the modes
  of (f) Hallmark Estrogen Response Early pathway, (g) Hallmark Coagulation pathway
  and (h) KEGG Wnt pathway, cells are grouped according to author annotation. Heatmap
  of scaled gene expression for top10 contributing genes for corresponding modes,
  ordered by decreasing contribution.'
