caption: Fibulin‐4 regulates autophagy in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)
  cells. (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h) Markers of autophagy were detected by western blot.
  Quantitative analysis of autophagy‐related protein expression with normalization
  to GAPDH. (i, j) 3‐MA (autophagy inhibitor) was added to Eca109 cells with fibulin‐4
  overexpression. Markers of autophagy were detected by western blot. Quantitative
  analysis of autophagy‐related protein expression with normalization to GAPDH. The
  error bars indicate the means ± SD averaged from three independent experiments.
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.
article_title: Downregulation of fibulin‐4 inhibits autophagy and promotes the sensitivity
  of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells to apatinib by activating the Akt‐mTOR
  signaling pathway.
