caption: Acetylation modulates key factors of type Ⅰ interferon (IFN) pathway during
  viral infection. In the upstream IFN signaling pathway, molecules such as cGAS,
  RIG-I, MAVS, IRF3, IRF7, and NF-κB, can be acetylated or deacetylated by specific
  acetyltransferases or deacetylases, modulating the production of IFN. In the downstream
  IFN signaling pathway, CBP can acetylate IFNAR2, STAT1, and STAT2, facilitating
  transcriptional activation of interferon-stimulated genes.
