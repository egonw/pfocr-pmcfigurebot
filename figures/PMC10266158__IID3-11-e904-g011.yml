caption: 'Effects of EPI on oxidative stress in adriamycin‐induced nephropathy rats.
  CON: control. (A) The levels of ROS in primary renal cells were measured by flow
  cytometry. (B) The oxidative stress‐related markers were measured by the cuvette
  assay. (C) The oxidative stress signaling pathway‐related proteins were measured
  by Western blot analysis. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD, n = 3 or 8 rats per
  group, *p < .05, **p < .01 compared with the ADR group. ADR, adriamycin‐induced
  nephropathy; EPI‐H, Epimedium sagittatum Maxim high dose group; EPI‐L, Epimedium
  sagittatum Maxim low dose; ROS, reactive oxygen species.'
article_title: Epimedium sagittatum Maxim ameliorates adriamycin‐induced nephropathy
  by restraining inflammation and apoptosis via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
