caption: RNA-seq analysis showed resveratrol enhances the stemness of hGMSCs in vitro.
  (A) Volcano plot showed the distribution of differentially expressed genes between
  the two groups of samples, with the horizontal axis representing the log2-fold changes
  in gene expression after resveratrol treatment and the vertical axis representing
  statistical significance. (B) Cluster heatmap showed the genes that were differentially
  regulated following treatment with 10 μM resveratrol. (C) Venn diagram showed the
  number of differentially expressed genes in hGMSCs with 10 μM resveratrol treatment
  (p < 0.05). (D) Enrichment analysis of the KEGG pathway showed several signaling
  pathways with obvious enrichment.
