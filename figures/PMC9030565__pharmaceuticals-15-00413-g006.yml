caption: A schematic representation of the different mechanisms of action of antibiotic
  adjuvants. (A) Inhibition of hydrolase/modifying enzyme either on antibiotics as
  shown in (1) or the antibiotic targets as shown in (2); (B) enhancement of the intracellular
  accumulation of the antibiotic by the inhibition of efflux pumps as shown in (1),
  the facilitation of the antibiotic through the surface membrane as shown in (2)
  or the destruction of the biofilm as shown in (3); (C) the complementary mechanism;
  (D) inhibiting the signaling and regulatory pathway responsible for mediating the
  antibiotic resistance; (E) the enhancement of the host defense through the stimulation
  of the immune cells.
