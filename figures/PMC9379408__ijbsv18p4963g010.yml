caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the proposed mechanism of CPTP in PC cells.
  CPTP expression affects the levels of sphingolipid metabolite ceramide as well as
  the PI4KA/AKT signaling pathways. At the point when CPTP expression is upregulated,
  activation of the PI4KA/AKT signaling pathway and decreased levels of the sphingolipid
  metabolite ceramide promote PC cell growth and metastasis, respectively. Furthermore,
  in PC cells, the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3 operate as upstream positive
  regulators of CPTP expression. Cer, ceramide.
