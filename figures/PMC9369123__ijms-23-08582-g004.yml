caption: Proposed mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiovascular
  complications via the PKC-MAPK pathway. Persistent hyperglycemia induces de novo
  production of diacylglycerol (DAG), which along with reactive oxygen (ROS), would
  induce the activation of PKC. Hyperglycemia also generates ROS and nitrogen species
  (RNS) in excess via NADPH oxidase, generating oxidative stress in the cardiac and
  vascular tissues. By activating Raf dependently and independently of Ras activation,
  PKC phosphorylates MAP3Ks of the MAPK subfamilies cascades. Following a stimulation,
  activation of MAPK requires a three-tiered kinase cascade; in which a MAPK kinase
  kinase (MAPKKK, MEKK, MAP3K or MKKK) activates a MAPK kinase (MAPKK, MEK, MAP2K
  or MKK), which in turn activates the targeted MAPKs (ERK1/2, JNK and p38) through
  serial phosphorylation. Uncontrolled activation of MAPKs induces inflammation and
  cell apoptosis, leading to pathologic cardiac remodelling and vascular dysfunction.
  Arrows represent the subsequent event/product in the pathway; tappered line represents
  inhibition action; dotted tappered line represents halted inhibition action.
