caption: 'Involvement of ER stress-regulated signaling in norketamine (NK)-induced
  RT4 cell apoptosis. Cells were treated with NK (0.2 mM) for different time intervals
  (2–24 h), and the levels of protein expression for (A) GRP78, GRP94, CHOP, XBP-1s,
  ATF-4, cleaved ATF-6, and caspase-12, and (B) the phosphorylated or total eIF2α,
  PERK, and IRE-1 were examined using Western blot analysis. Additionally, RT4 cells
  were treated with NK (0.2 mM) for 24 h in the absence or presence of an ER stress
  inhibitor 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA; 2 mM; for 1 h prior to treated with NK),
  and (C) the levels of protein expression for GRP78, CHOP, XBP-1s, ATF-4, cleaved
  ATF-6, Caspase-3, -7, -12, and PARP were examined using Western blot analysis; and
  (D) caspase-3 activity was detected using the caspase-3 Activity Assay Kit. Results
  shown in A, B, and C on representative images, and quantification was determined
  by densitometric analysis. Each bar presented is the mean ± SD of three independent
  experiments. Data in D are presented as the means ± SD of four independent experiments
  assayed in triplicate. * p < 0.05 compared to vehicle control. # p < 0.05 compared
  to NK treatment alone.'
