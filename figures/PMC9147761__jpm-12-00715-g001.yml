caption: Cancer initiation and the process of cell stemness induction (reprogramming)
  employs overlapping molecular signaling and epigenetic pathways. Expression of transcription
  factors—such as OCT4, KLF4, SOX2, NANOG, and JDP2—is necessary for cancer initiation,
  along with genetic mutations and epigenetic changes. In somatic stem cells, for
  example MSCs, an increased expression of CD133 by the JAK-STAT 3 pathway activates
  the migration of MSCs to cancer cells and can increase the number of CSCs. CSC niche
  factors that induce self-renewal of CSCs stimulate angiogenesis and recruit other
  cells producing additional factors related to tumor metastasis. Patient-derived
  iPCSC organoid models are useful for examining the mechanisms of drug resistance
  and cancer progression.
