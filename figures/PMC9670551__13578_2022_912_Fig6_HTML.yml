caption: 'Clinical data and xenograft model demonstrate AR/lncTCFL5-2/YBX1/SOX2/CSCs
  pathway. A IHC staining for AR, YBX1, and SOX2 of tumor (T) tissues, adjacent tumor
  (AT) tissues and normal (N) tissues in ccRCC samples. B Real-time RT-PCR assays
  for detecting lncTCFL5-2, YBX1 and SOX2 mRNA expressions in tumor and normal tissues.
  C Real-time RT-PCR assays for detecting AR mRNA expression in tumor tissues and
  normal tissues and the correlation analysis of AR and lncTCFL5-2. D 560 RCC patients
  from TCGA dataset were divided into two groups according to AR expression. Survival
  curves showed that patients who have a higher AR expression have a higher survival
  rate. E AR expression in M0 and M1 patients, in different grades and different stages.
  F AR expression in RCC sample with necrosis or no necrosis (left panel), the correlation
  of YBX1 and AR protein (middle panel). 560 RCC patients from TCGA dataset were divided
  into two groups according to CD24 expression. Survival curves showed that patients
  who have a higher CD24 expression have a lower survival rate (right panel). G-M
  Results from in vivo mouse studies. G IVIS imaging was used to determine the tumor
  sizes and metastases. H We treated mice with 40 mg/kg Sunitinib daily IP for two
  weeks, IVIS imaging was used to determine the tumor sizes and metastases. I After
  sacrificing the mice the tumor tissues were obtained as shown (N: normoxia, H: hypoxia).
  J Weights of the xenografts were shown in four groups. K Weights reduction of the
  xenografts were shown in two groups after Sunitinib treatment (weight reduction = mean
  weight treated without Sunitinib-weight treated with Sunitinib). L Representative
  bioluminescent images of different organ metastasis. (N: normoxia, H: hypoxia) M
  The IHC for AR, YBX1, SOX2 of xenografts in four groups (N: normoxia, H: hypoxia)'
