caption: 'Validation of the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway. A, HupT3 cell number,
  quantified by FACS, following knockout of intergenic control locus or MSLN and coculture
  with MSLN CAR T or UTD cells at the indicated E:T ratios for 48 hours (n = 3; t
  test); FACS plot showing the impact of GPAA1 loss on MSLN. B, HupT3/KP4_MSLN cell
  survival, quantified by firefly luciferase assay, following knockout of intergenic
  control locus, MSLN, GPAA1, PIGA, or PIGW and coculture with MSLN CAR T or UTD cells
  at the indicated E:T ratios (HupT3: 24 hours, n = 3; KP4_MSLN: 72 hours, n = 3;
  Dunnett test). C, FACS plots showing the impact of GPAA1, PIGA, or PIGW loss on
  MSLN expression. D, Volume of tumors formed by PACADD-161 cells infected with control
  (n = 10) or GPAA1 (n = 18) guides and injected into the flanks of NSG mice; 5M CAR
  or UTD cells injected intravenously at day 0 (t test; arrow, T-cell injection).
