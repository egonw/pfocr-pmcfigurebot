caption: 'Stepwise increase in D-limonene production through the enhancement of the
  MVA pathway of monoterpene synthesis: (a) metabolic pathways for the production
  of various terpenes; and (b) D-limonene accumulation in engineered strains. Blue
  boxes represent gene overexpression. The limonene titer was only 53.14 µg/L when
  only the tHMG1 and IDI genes were strengthened; reached 12.18 mg/L after further
  strengthening ERG10, ERG13, and ERG12; and reached 36.77 mg/L after all seven genes
  of the MVA pathway were enhanced. After another tHMG1 copy was added, the limonene
  titers reached 46.96 mg/L (Statistical significance is indicated as ** for p < 0.01).'
