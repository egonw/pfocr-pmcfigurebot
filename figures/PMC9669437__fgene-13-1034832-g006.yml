caption: MiRNA-190a-5p targets PHLPP1 to regulate the protein expression levels of
  key genes on the primordial follicle hyperactivation signaling pathway. (A) Western
  blot analysis of PHLPP1, LHR, AKT, p-AKT, FOXO3a, and p-FOXO3a during the VCD treating
  process (D6, D10, D15, and D45) in rat ovaries tissues. GAPDH was used as a negative
  control. (B) and (C) Protein analysis comparing the concentrations of PHLPP1 and
  LHR with GAPDH used as a loading control. (D) and (E) Protein analysis comparing
  the concentrations of phosphorylated and total AKT, and FOXO3a with GAPDH used as
  a loading control, respectively. The ratio of phosphorylated to non-phosphorylated
  protein was calculated for each protein. Data are summarized and presented as mean
  ± SEM from four independent experiments. *p＜0.05, **p＜0.01 and ***p＜0.001 vs. control.
