caption: Insulin receptor signaling pathways in Schistosoma japonicum. The dotted
  line suggests this pathway has not (yet) been demonstrated in S. japonicum. The
  IR signaling pathways are activated by insulin, which stimulate downstream pathways.
  SHC can bind IR to induce MAPK pathway. PIK3/AKT pathway is associated with glycogen
  synthesis, protein synthesis, and glycolysis. CBL/CAP pathway is involved in the
  translocation of SGTP4 to the plasma membrane.
