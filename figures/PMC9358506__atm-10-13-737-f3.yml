caption: 'Correlations among DEGs and co-expression networks. (A) The PPI network
  of DEGs. Each node represents one protein, and each edge represents one protein-protein
  association. The red nodes represent upregulated genes, and the blue nodes represent
  downregulated genes. (B) Fifteen hub genes identified by the plugin of MCODE and
  CytoHubba from the DEGs. (C) A co-expression network of mRNAs and target miRNAs.
  mRNAs (red nodes) was restricted to the 7 hub genes involved in the KEGG pathway,
  and miRNAs (blue nodes) were the predicted targets of 7 mRNAs based on the online
  databases. (D) Expression level of transcripts per million (TPM) between the CLP
  and sham groups. Left: mmu-miR-7212-5p; right: mmu-miR-134-5p. *P<0.05; **P<0.01.
  (E) A ceRNA network of Hmox1. The red nodes represent the hub gene Hmox1, the blue
  nodes represent differentially expressed miRNAs, and the green nodes represent target
  lncRNAs. DEGs, differentially expressed genes; PPI, protein-protein interaction;
  MCODE, minimal Common Oncology Data Elements; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
  and Genomes; ceRNA, competitive endogenous RNA; CLP, cecal ligation and puncture.'
