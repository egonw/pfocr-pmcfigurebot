caption: SPRC increases H2S level in AIA rat model. Rat plasma samples were collected
  and subjected to HPLC-MS for total hydrogen sulfide (S2−/HS−/H2S) detection. Representative
  peak area of derivative product SDB in (A) Na2S (0–20 μM) groups or (D) experimental
  groups were calculated by Agilent software, as well as (B,E) that of hydrocortisone.
  (C) The area ratio of SDB/IS was used to construct a standard curve. (F) The exact
  concentrations of total hydrogen sulfide in plasma were calculated using the standard
  curve. Bars indicate the mean ± SEM. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001. n = 3 or 5 in each
  group.
