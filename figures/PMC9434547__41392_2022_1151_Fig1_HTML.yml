caption: Lactate metabolism and lactylation in cells. In the cytoplasm, lactate is
  transported into cells by MCTs and is produced from glycolysis or glutamine decomposition.
  The catabolism of lactate in cells occurs through two pathways. In one pathway,
  lactate is oxidized to pyruvate, which enters mitochondria and is metabolized through
  the tricarboxylic acid cycle. In the other pathway, lactate is converted to glucose
  through gluconeogenesis. Lactate can be converted into lactyl-CoA and is involved
  in the lactylation of histones and nonhistone proteins. LDH lactate dehydrogenase;
  PDH pyruvate dehydrogenase; GLUD glutamate dehydrogenase; HDACs Histone Deacetylases.
