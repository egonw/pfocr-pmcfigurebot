caption: SW480/oxaliplatin cell-derived exosomes promotes cell proliferation. Exosomes
  were extracted from SW480/oxaliplatin and SW480 cells and then co-cultured with
  HUVECs. Effects of SW480/oxaliplatin cell-derived exosomes on proliferation of HUVECs
  were detected by EdU. All the above experiments were repeatedly performed 3 times;
  data are shown as the means ± SD. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01.
