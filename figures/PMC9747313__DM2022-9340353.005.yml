caption: 'QTF mitigates MP infection-induced cytokine release and ER stress in vivo.
  (a) Lung tissue HE staining from each group. ×200. (b) The TNF-α and IL-8 release.
  (c) Western blot assay was used to detect the protein levels of cytoplasmic and
  nuclear NF-κB. (d) The protein PERK, eIF2α, p-eIF2α, ATF4, and CHOP levels were
  measured. ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. control; ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001 vs. model; +P < 0.05,
  ++P < 0.01 vs. QTF low dose; $P < 0.05 vs. QTF-medium dose.'
