figure_title: p53 inhibitor pifithrin-α rescues the hearing loss in Rest cKO mice
caption: 'A Timeline for ABR testing and drug treatment. Pifithrin-α was administered
  to 2-month-old Rest cKO mice at 2.2 mg/kg every other day, for 30 days. B Representative
  ABR waveforms were shown in WT, Rest cKO, and Rest cKO+ pifithrin-α (PFT-α) mice.
  C ABR thresholds of WT and Rest cKO mice are treated with pifithrin-α. Arrows indicate
  when the threshold exceeded the upper limits of TDT ABR system. D, E Morphometry
  of SGNs in WT, Rest cKO, and Rest cKO+ pifithrin-α mice. Scale bar: 20 µm. F–I Expression
  of cleaved caspase-3 in SGNs of apex, middle and base of cochlea from WT and Rest
  cKO mice. Scale bar: 20 µm. Data are represented as mean ± SEM. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.'
