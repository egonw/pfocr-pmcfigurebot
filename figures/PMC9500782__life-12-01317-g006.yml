caption: Enrichment pathways analyses in HBECs treated with HIV, SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike
  protein, or combination. We used the gene lists obtained from our gene expression
  analyses to perform over-representation pathway analyses using the Reactome pathway
  database (available at https://reactome.org/ (accessed on 21 August 2022)). The
  enriched pathways shown in Venn diagrams in the top panel indicate the upregulated
  pathways; the bottom panel shows downregulated signaling pathways. The blue shapes
  represent data from HBECs exposed to SARS-CoV-2 S1 Spike protein only; the red shapes
  represent data from HBECs treated with infectious HIV only, and the yellow shapes
  represent data from HBECs treated with the combination. The blended colors (orange
  and dark gray) represent signaling pathways that are common between the indicated
  treatments.
