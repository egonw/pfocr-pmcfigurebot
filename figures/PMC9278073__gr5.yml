caption: 'Osteogenic differentiation after ectopic implantation of hydrogel scaffolds
  with different densities of BMSCs for 4 weeks. (a) Immunofluorescence staining images
  of osteogenic related proteins Runx2 (green), Osterix (green), OCN (red), and Col-1a
  (red). Cell nuclei stained in blue. Scale bar: 50 ​μm. (b) Masson staining of isolated
  tissues showing collagen deposition (blue), and (c) Collagen type I and Ⅲ (orange-yellow
  indicates type I collagen, blue-green indicates type III collagen) as observed after
  Sirius red staining. Scale bar: 100 ​μm. (d) Quantitative results of the area of
  collagen and (e) the ratio of type Ⅰ/Ⅲ collagen. αp<0.05 vs T0; βp<0.05 vs T5; γp<0.05
  vs T6; δp<0.05 vs T7. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure
  legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)'
