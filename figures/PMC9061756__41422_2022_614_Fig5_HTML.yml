figure_title: Analysis of ceramide metabolism in the LAR subtype revealed S1P as a
  potential therapeutic target
caption: 'a Log2 fold change of lipid subclasses between tumor and normal tissues
  and between LAR and non-LAR tumors. Log2 fold change of each lipid subclass was
  calculated as the mean log2 fold change of the abundances of lipids belonging to
  this subclass. b Metabolomic changes in sphingolipid (SP) metabolism. Log2 fold
  changes of the abundances of metabolites in tumor samples (LAR or non-LAR) as compared
  with normal tissues were illustrated. c Transcriptomic changes in three SP metabolism-related
  pathways. ssGSEA scores of the pathways based on transcriptomics were calculated
  and compared among LAR tumors, non-LAR tumors and normal tissues. d Proportions
  of isotope-labeled intermediates that are involved in the de novo synthesis and
  degradation of the ceramide pathway in LAR and non-LAR cell lines. MDA-MB-453 and
  MFM-223 cell lines of LAR subtype as well as BT-549 and LM2-4175 cell lines of non-LAR
  subtype were used for experiments. Each sample was detected with three replicates.
  e, f Viability detection of PDOs after blocking different steps involved in de novo
  synthesis and degradation of ceramide pathway (n = 5 different PDOs with three replicates
  for each group). The efficacy of inhibition (e) and representative images (f) were
  illustrated. The concentrations of the inhibitors were as follows: NCT-503, 30 µM;
  PF-543, 10 µM; Opaganib, 50 µM; Siponimod, 30 µM; JTE-013, 30 µM; FTY-720, 1 µM.
  g Pharmacological tests of PF-543 and FTY-720 using mini-PDX models. h Drug sensitivity
  results for mini-PDX models of LAR and non-LAR tumors (n = 3 different mini-PDX
  with three replicates for each group). Statistical comparisons in d, e and h were
  conducted using two-tailed Student’s t-test. Data are presented as means ± SEM.
