caption: Regulation of lipoxin pathway in response to ocular hypertension. (A) The
  time course response of lipoxin pathway genes was analyzed by qPCR at 2, 4, and
  8 weeks. The results were normalized to GAPDH and age-matched controls. n = 3–4
  (2 retinas were pooled for each replicate). (B) LC‒MS/MS-based lipidomic quantification
  of endogenous lipid mediators in the mouse retina at 4 weeks, n = 3 (4 retinas were
  pooled for each replicate). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, **p < 0.001. (Ctrl- Control;
  OHT- ocular hypertension)
