caption: Effects of belowground and aboveground insect herbivory on ethylene pathway
  gene expression. (a) Schematic diagram of the ethylene signaling pathway. ER, endoplasmic
  reticulum; ACS, 1‐aminocyclopropane‐1‐carboxylate synthase; ACO, 1‐aminocyclopropane‐1‐carboxylate
  oxidase; ETR, ethylene receptor; EIN2, ethylene insensitive 2 (Tamaoki, ). (b and
  c) Heat map of ethylene signaling pathway‐related gene expression in maize shoot
  (b) and roots (c). Samples were collected from maize plants that were kept non‐manipulated
  (C, control) or after 72 h of belowground infestation by  Diabrotica virgifera virgifera  (DV),
  mechanical damage on root (MR), 72 h of aboveground infestation by  Spodoptera frugiperda  (SF),
  or mechanical damage on shoot (MS). Color coding represents the range of log2(fold
  change relative to control).
