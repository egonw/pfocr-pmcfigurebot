caption: 'KEGG pathway enrichment of differentially accumulated metabolites in C.
  vietnamensis leaves in response to MeJA for different comparison groups. (A): KEGG
  pathway enrichment of CK vs. 10 mM MJ—2 h and CK vs. 10 mM MJ—48 h. Each bubble
  represents a metabolic pathway (the top 20 with the most significance were selected
  according to the p value). The size of the bubble represents the number of metabolites
  in the pathway with topology analysis. The color of the bubble represents the p
  value of the enrichment analysis (i.e., −log10 p value); the darker the color, the
  smaller the p value, and the more significant the enrichment degree. (B): Differential
  abundance score map for all differential metabolic pathways. The Y-axis in the figure
  represents the name of the differential pathway, and the X-axis coordinates represent
  the differential abundance score (DA score). The DA score is the overall total change
  in all metabolites in the metabolic pathway. A score of 1 indicates that all identified
  metabolites in the pathway exhibit a trend of upregulated expression, whereas −1
  indicates a trend of downregulated expression. The darker the red, the more likely
  the overall expression of the pathway is to be upregulated. The darker the blue,
  the more likely the overall expression of the pathway is downregulated.'
