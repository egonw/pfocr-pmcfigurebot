caption: Emetine acted via blockade of multiple signaling cascades. MGC803 and HGC-27
  cells were treated with different concentrations of emetine for 18 h, and then the
  proteins were extracted for western blot. A Western blot assay was used to verify
  the effects of emetine against Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. B Inhibitory effects
  of emetine on the downstream effector and target proteins of Hippo signaling pathway.
  C Regulation of emetine on the pivotal proteins of MAPKs and PI3K/AKT signaling
  axes
article_title: Emetine, a small molecule natural product, displays potent anti-gastric
  cancer activity via regulation of multiple signaling pathways.
