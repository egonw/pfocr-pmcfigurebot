caption: (A) Metabolic set enrichment analysis (MSEA) showing the most altered biochemical
  metabolic pathways in MUC1H compared to MUC1L ccRCC (Enrichment overview). (B) In
  the enrichment analysis map, all the matched pathways are displayed as circles (Pathway
  analysis). The color and size of each circle are based on the p-value and pathway
  impact value, respectively. (C) Results of pathway analysis are listed according
  to p-value and false discovery rate (FDR).
