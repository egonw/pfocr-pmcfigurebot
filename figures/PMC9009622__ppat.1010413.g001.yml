figure_title: Mechanisms by which Candida albicans may play a role in oral cancer
  development
caption: (A) (1) Production of carcinogenic substances. C. albicans, using the enzyme
  ADH1, is capable of metabolizing alcohol to acetaldehyde, which is carcinogenic.
  Acetaldehyde binds to proteins and DNA modifying their structure and functionality,
  resulting in mitochondrial damage, and also reducing antioxidant activity of glutathione
  leading to increased intracellular levels of ROS. These alterations may produce
  genome instability linked with inhibition of the apoptotic machinery ultimately
  leading to tumor development. (2) Activation of oncogenic pathways in epithelial
  cells by candidalysin. C. albicans secrete candidalysin toxin that damages the epithelial
  barrier and activates EGFR with downstream up-regulation of the MAPK pathway that
  has been implicated in various types of cancer. (3) Induction of tumor-promoting
  immunity. EGFR activation also causes downstream up-regulation of the NFκΒ pathway
  in epithelial cells resulting in the expression of IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-36, and G-CSF.
  Myeloid cells including antigen presenting cells and macrophages recognize Candida
  and secrete tumor promoting cytokines including IL-23, IL-6, and IL-1. Additionally,
  the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway is activated. Collectively, cytokines secreted by
  epithelial and myeloid cells result in activation of Th17 (IL-17 secreting) cells.
  Type 17 immune responses further support cancer progression by antagonizing Th1
  (IFNγ secreting) cells. (B) At the oral mucosa, these tumor promoting mechanisms
  may have the potential of causing cytologic and architectural alterations in the
  oral epithelium (dysplasia), and their accumulation may lead to the development
  of OSCC, which is characterized by tumor islands (red arrows) invading the underlying
  connective tissue. ADH1, alcohol dehydrogenase 1; EGFR, epidermal growth factor
  receptor; G-CSF, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; IFNγ, interferon gamma;
  IL, interleukin; NFκΒ, nuclear factor kappa B; OSCC, oral squamous cell carcinoma;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; Th, T helper.
