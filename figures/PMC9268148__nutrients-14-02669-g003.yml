caption: HCA stimulates unfolded protein response pathway. Cell lysate was prepared
  from K562 cells treated with indicated concentration of HCA. Proteins were separated
  and immunoblotted with antibody against desired protein. (A) HCA induces concomitant
  activation of AMPK and mTORC1 pathways in K562 cells. Samples were loaded in duplicate.
  One of them was used to immunoblot with phosphor form and the other was used to
  immunoblot respective total protein. Upper vinculin is referred to as p-AMPK, p-p70S6K,
  and pS6 ribosomal protein; lower vinculin is referred to as total AMPK, p70S6K,
  and S6 ribosomal protein. (B) HCA-treated K562 show upregulation of unfolded protein
  response markers ATF4 and p-elF2α. Upper vinculin is referred to as peIF2α and ATF4;
  lower vinculin is referred to as eIF2α. The bar graph beside each figure panel reflects
  the band intensity evaluated as optical density and represented as fold change for
  treated vs. untreated cells normalized for vinculin. ** p < 0.01, * p < 0.05 treated
  vs. untreated cells.
