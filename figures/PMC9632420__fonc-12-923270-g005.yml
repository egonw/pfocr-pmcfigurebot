caption: Knockdown of USP8 increases apoptosis and enhances docetaxel-mediated apoptosis
  in PCa where its overexpression shows the opposite effects. (A) The DU145 and PC3
  cells were transfected or treated with siUSP8 and docetaxel IC50 individually or
  combined, and the apoptosis was examined using a flow cytometry assay. (B) The DU145
  and PC3 cells were transfected or treated with pCMV3-USP8 and docetaxel IC50 individually
  or combined, and the apoptosis was examined using a flow cytometry assay. The four-quadrant
  pictures observed by flow cytometric analysis are shown by the dot plot. Q1 shows
  necrotic cells, Q2 shows later period apoptotic cells, Q3 shows early apoptotic
  cells, and Q4 shows normal cells. (C) The total percentage of apoptotic cells (sum
  of apoptotic cells and early apoptotic cells) shown in the bar diagram to compare
  the value between and among the study groups. The data are shown as mean ± SD from
  three replicated experiments (n = 3, **p < 0.01; *p <0.05).

  and metastasis and promotes docetaxel’s activity by suppressing the NF-kB signaling
