caption: 'The loss of N-WASP in mice with KRasG12D-induced tumors activates the EGFR
  and KRas signaling pathway. Protein lysates from epidermis samples of the N-WASPKOG12D
  and N-WASPHetG12D mice (at 37 days post TAM injection) were subjected to a Western
  blot analysis, using antibodies against Cyclin D1, EGFR, P-ERK1/2 (A), Glut1 (B),
  and P-4EPB. (C) GAPDH was used as a loading control (n = 3). Results: means Â± SEs.
  *** p < 0.001 and * p < 0.05. uncropped WB images were shown in .'
