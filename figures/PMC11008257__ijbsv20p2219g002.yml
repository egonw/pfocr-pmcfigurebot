caption: NUP85 silencing alleviates inflammation and lipid accumulation in primary
  liver cells. A. Image of extracted primary liver cells. B-E. The mRNA and protein
  expression levels of NUP85, SREBP-1C, PPAR-α, ACOX-1, IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 in the
  MCS group and MCD group. F-I. The mRNA and protein expression levels of NUP85, SREBP-1C,
  PPAR-α, ACOX-1, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in control NUP85 knockdown primary liver cells
  and NUP85 knockdown primary liver cells. All experimental results of this study
  were replicated at least three times. **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 compared with the control
  group.
