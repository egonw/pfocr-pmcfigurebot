caption: 'miR-429 knockdown promotes the proliferation, migration, and invasion of
  C666-1 cells through JAK1/STAT3 pathway. (a) The binding site between miR-429 and
  JAK1 was predicted by starBase. The mutant binding sequence was designed for dual-luciferase
  report assay. The luciferase signaling was significantly declined in JAK1 wild group
  transfected with miR-429 mimic. ∗∗p < 0.01, compared with miRNA-ctrl group. After
  being transfected with si-JAK1, the mRNA expression (b) and protein expression (c)
  of JAK1 was detected by RT-PCR analysis and western blot analysis, respectively.
  Results showed that JAK1 expression significantly declined, suggesting the transcription
  efficiency was high. NS: no significant difference; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001. (d)
  Cell colony formation assay was performed to evaluate cell validity. Cell vitality
  was significantly elevated after being cultured for 24, 48, and 72 h in the miR-429
  inhibitor + si-NC group and reversed after being transfected with si-JAK1. ∗∗∗p
  < 0.001. (e) Cell colony formation assay showed that the number of cell colonies
  was significantly increased in miR-429 knockdown cells and obviously reversed after
  cotransfected with si-JAK1. NS: no significant difference; ∗∗∗p < 0.001. Cell wound
  scratch (f) and transwell assay (g) were conducted to further investigate the effect
  of si-JAK1 on cell migration and invasion. The migration and invasion ability of
  C666-1 cells were significantly elevated in the miR-429 inhibitor + si-NC group.
  NS: no significant difference; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001.'
