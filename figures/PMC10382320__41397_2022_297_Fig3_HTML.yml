figure_title: The PPARA pathway activity score in breast cancer
caption: 'a The PPARA pathway activity scores from TCGA BC tissue samples. b The PPARA
  pathway activity score in GSE48213 BC cell lines. Pairwise comparisons between groups
  were performed with t-tests followed by Benjamini–Hochberg corrections. The significance
  level of adjusted p-values is as follows: ns, p > 0.05; *p ≤ 0.05; **p ≤ 0.01; ***p ≤ 0.001;
  ****p ≤ 0.0001.'
article_title: Bioinformatics driven discovery of small molecule compounds that modulate
  the FOXM1 and PPARA pathway activities in breast cancer.
