caption: 'The regulatory relationship of transcription factor HIF-1 on the LDH-A gene
  in the dual-luciferase reporter assay. (A) Transcription factor HIF-1 transcriptionally
  regulates the LDH-A gene. The pGL3 and pc3.1 represent circular pGL3-Basic plasmid
  and circular pcDNA3.1 (+) plasmid, respectively, which are not linked to the exogenous
  sequence. Reporter plasmid pGL~LDH-A was constructed using the LDH-A gene promoter
  sequence and fragmented pGL3-Basic plasmid digested by double endonuclease (SacI
  and HindIII). Expression plasmid pc3.1~HIF-1α was constructed using the HIF-1α CDS
  sequence and fragmented pcDNA3.1 (+) digested by single endonuclease (BamHI). Expression
  plasmid pc3.1~HIF-1β was constructed using the same method. PRL-TK is the control
  plasmid expressing Renilla luciferase (Rluc) to characterize the transfection efficiency.
  Arabic numerals of abscissa in A indicate different treatment groups. (B) The fragmentation
  deletion result. The high triangle icons represent the putative HIF-1 binding site,
  which is predicted using JASPAR online software. Lp, Lf2, Lf1, and Lf0 represent
  reporter plasmids connecting different length promoter sequences, which are shown
  by four light gray horizontal lines. These reporter plasmids (pGL~Lf2, pGL~Lf1,
  and pGL~Lf0) were connected by different length LDH-A gene promoter sequences and
  fragmented pGL 3-Basic digested by double endonuclease (SacI and HindIII), respectively.
  Plasmids of pGL~Lp and pGL are the same as pGL~LDH-A and pGL3 in A, respectively.
  (C) The bases mutation result. We mutated one putative transcription factor binding
  site (−2336) to obtain two mutant plasmids (pGL~Lmp, pGL~Lm2), which were deleted
  putative HIF-1 binding sequences (−2343~−2336: GGACGTGA). The mutant plasmids were
  constructed using fragmented pGL3-Basic digested using double endonuclease (SacI
  and HindIII) and the mutant sequence obtained using high fidelity fusion PCR. Different
  letters indicate significant differences (p < 0.05).'
