figure_title: GXYLT1S212* induces increased metastatic activity in CRC than WT GXYLT1
  in vivo
caption: 'The spleens of mice were injected with 5 × 106 HCT116 cells infected with
  LV-control, LV-GXYLT1, or LV-S212* (n = 5 mice per group). a GXYLT1 and GXYLT1S212*
  expressions were confirmed in HCT116 cells stably infected with LV-GXYLT1 and LV-S212*,
  respectively. b Representative bioluminescence imaging of mice two weeks after implantation.
  c Quantification of bioluminescence imaging in the mouse liver from the indicated
  groups. d Representative images of liver metastatic nodules from the indicated groups.
  e Representative images of H&E staining in liver metastatic lesions from the indicated
  group. Scale bars: top, 300 μm; bottom, 60 μm. f Number of metastatic liver nodules
  from the indicated groups. Data are presented as the mean ± SD (n = 5). *p < 0.05.'
