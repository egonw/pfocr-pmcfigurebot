caption: Src facilitates the relocalization of GALNTs from Golgi to ER by promoting
  the binding of GBF1 to Arf1. The transfer of GALNTs from Golgi to ER is called “GALA
  pathway”, which is essential for tumor growth. The transport of GALNTs from Golgi
  to ER is dependent on the GTP exchange factors GBF1 and Arf-GDP, Src induces the
  formation of tubular transport carriers containing GALNTs and also phosphorylates
  GBF1, where phosphorylation of two sites on GBF1, Y876, and Y898, and facilitates
  the binding of GBF1 to Arf-GDP. This led to the efflux of GALNTs from the Golgi
  membrane and their eventual relocalization to the ER.
