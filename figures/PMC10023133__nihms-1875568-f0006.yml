figure_title: Alternative splicing events regulate various pathways impacting ferroptosis
  stress response
caption: (a, b) Circos plots showing the overlap between different AS events at the
  gene level (purple lines) or at the pathway enrichment level (blue lines) in Erastin
  (a) and RSL3 (b). The tables under the plots show the number of genes in each AS
  type and the number of unique genes belong to each AS event type. (c) Gene ontology
  (GO) analysis for the alternatively spliced genes in the Erastin group showing a
  dominance of RI events in regulating multiple pathways and the presence of a node
  related to regulation of translation (red dotted box). (d) GO analysis for the AS
  genes in RSL3.
