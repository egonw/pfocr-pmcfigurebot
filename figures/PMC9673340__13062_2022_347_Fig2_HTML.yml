caption: Silencing of SH3BP5-AS1 expression inhibited the invasion, migration, and
  stemness of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. vivo. A, B Transwell assay revealed
  the migration and invasion abilities of BxPC-3 and MIA Paca-2 cells transfected
  with shCtrl or shSH3BP5-AS1. C, D Histogram displaying the statistical results of
  the Transwell assay. E EMT-related markers were detected by western blot. F–I Sphere
  formation analysis. J–L Stem cell-like cell markers Lin28, OCT4, NANOG, and SOX-2
  were detected by western blot and RT-qPCR. Data are shown as the mean ± SD of three
  replicates. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01
article_title: N6-methyladenosine-mediated SH3BP5-AS1 upregulation promotes GEM chemoresistance
