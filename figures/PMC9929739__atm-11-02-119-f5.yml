caption: LncRNA GAS5 inhibited SK-OV-3 cell proliferation via the miR-23a/WT1 pathway.
  (A) The WT1 expression was determined by Western blotting in each of the SK-OV-3
  cells. (B) The CCK-8 assay results showed that the proliferative ability of SK-OV-3
  cells in the underlined 6 groups. (C) Cell proliferative ability of SK-OV-3 cells
  in the underlined 6 groups (scale bar, 100 µm). (D) Flow cytometry analyzed the
  cell apoptosis of SK-OV-3 in the underlined 6 groups.***, P<0.001 vs. mimics NC
  or inhibitor NC group; &&, P<0.01 vs. mimics or inhibitor group. WT1, WT1 transcription
  factor; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; NC, negative control; CCK-8,
  Cell Counting Kit-8; OD, optical density; EdU, 5-Ethynyl-2’- deoxyuridine; DAPI,
  2-(4-Amidinophenyl)-6-indolecarbamidine dihydrochloride; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate;
  PI, propidium iodide; FCM, flow cytometer.
