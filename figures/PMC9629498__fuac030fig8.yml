caption: Principles of the peptidoglycan biosynthesis highlighting methods to monitor
  growth rate and dividing behavior. The nascent and total bacterial peptidoglycan
  regions can be labeled using antibiotics, lectins, and amino acids derivatives.
  (A) Peptidoglycan synthesis dyes during short pulse labeled the nascent peptidoglycan
  sites while long pulse uniformly labeled growing bacteria. Of note, non-growing
  bacterial subset remains unlabeled. (B) Bacteria uniformly labeled with either nascent
  peptidoglycan dyes during long pulse or total peptidoglycan dyes will incorporated
  unlabeled new materials during the chase period. Time-lapse microscopy monitoring
  allows measuring the bacterial and the subcellular growth rate based on unlabeled
  region extension. A non-growing bacterial subset should remain uniformly labeled
  at the chase time. (C) Short sequential pulse-chase using different fluorophores
  label the nascent peptidoglycan sites sequentially. End-point analysis creates a
  growing map over-time. (D) Continuous pulse enable real-time measurement of the
  nascent peptidoglycan sites kinetics of growing bacteria using time-lapse microscopy.
  Growing labeled bacteria via the recycling pathway highlight dividing step due to
  fluorescence intensity drop at the septum. (C) and (D) Short sequential pulse-chase
  and continuous pulse should, therefore, discriminate the non-growing unlabeled subset
  and highlighted the growth rate.
