caption: The metabolic pathway map related to metabolic profiling in serum, according
  to the effects of heat stress in each group. The x-axis represents the pathway impact
  values computed from pathway topological analysis, and the y-axis represents the
  −log of p-value obtained from pathway enrichment analysis. The pathways that were
  most significantly changed are characterized by both a high −log(p) value and high
  impact value (top right region). The color and size of each dot were associated
  with the −log(p) value and pathway impact value, respectively, where a small p value
  and high pathway impact value indicate the pathway is greatly influenced by heat
  stress.
