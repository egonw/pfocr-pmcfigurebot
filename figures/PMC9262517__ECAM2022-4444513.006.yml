caption: PFWE inhibited the MAPK/JNK-c-Fos signaling pathway. The LPS-stimulated A549
  cells were treated without or with PFWE (800 μg/ml). (a) and (c) The JNK, phosphorylated-JNK
  (p-JNK), c-Fos, and the phosphorylated-c-Fos (p-c-Fos) were detected by western
  blotting. (b) and (d) The quantitative results of p-JNK or p-c-Fos were calculated
  based on the normalization of the signals to the signals of JNK or c-Fos, respectively
  (n = 6 in each group). The data are presented as mean ± SEM (∗∗p < 0.01) compared
  with the LPS-stimulated group and analyzed using the t-test (nonparametric tests)
  and the Mann–Whitney test.
