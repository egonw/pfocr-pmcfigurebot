caption: 'PTGS2 is a downstream target of the BL001/LRH1 signaling pathway(A–C) Ptgs2
  expression levels were assessed in (A) islets isolated from IndbLRH-1 mice treated
  or not with TAM, (B) mouse islets treated with a cytokine cocktail (CTK) for 2,
  6, and 24 h, and (C) islets treated with or without cytokines and BL001 for 24 h.(D)
  siSC or siPTGS2 transfected mouse islets treated or not with cytokines and BL001.
  Ptgs2 expression levels were normalized to either the housekeeping gene Gapdh or
  Cyclophilin.(E) Secreted PGE2 levels were assessed by ELISA in the culture media
  of siSC and siPTGS2 transfected islets treated or not with cytokines and BL001.
