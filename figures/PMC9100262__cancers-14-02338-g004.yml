caption: 'MBOP interacts with MEK1 in CRC. (A) Immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by
  mass spectrometry assay identified the interacting proteins of MBOP. (B) Venn diagram
  where 1 refers to pcDNA3.1+, 2 refers to pORF-FLAG, and 3 refers to pORFm-FLAG,
  delineated the range of potential interacting proteins—in total 266 candidate proteins.
  (C) KEGG analysis of the above-mentioned 266 proteins, and viral-infection relevant
  pathways ranked the top among all the pathways. (D) Sequential coverage and molecular
  weight of some candidate interacting proteins. (E) After overexpressing pcDNA3.1+,
  pORF-FLAG, and pORFmut-FLAG in HCT116 and HCT15, the direct interaction between
  MBOP and MEK1 was proved. (F) MBOP did not significantly alter the mRNA expression
  of MAP2K1, but substantially promoted the protein level of total MEK1 (pMEK1 included).
  Data are presented as mean ± SD, **** p < 0.0001. ns: not significant.'
