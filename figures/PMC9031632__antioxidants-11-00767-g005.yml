caption: HO-1 enzymatic inhibition increased BTZ cytotoxicity by rising mitochondrial
  depolarization. (A) Representative dot plots of the effect of SnPP, BTZ, and SnPP/BTZ
  treatment on the viability of U266 and NCI-H929 cells are shown. The graphs (right
  panels) show the mean values of the percentage of apoptotic cells after annexin
  V–FITC and PI staining. (B) Mitochondrial membrane potential was evaluated after
  drug treatment. Representative histograms of a flow cytometric analysis are shown
  (left panels). (C) Flow cytometry analysis of mitochondrial mass 24 h post-treatment.
  Representative histograms (left panels) are shown. Data are expressed as mean MFI
  ± SEM of n ≥ 4 biological replicates; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; ****
  p < 0.0001.
