caption: PPV1 infection promotes NF-κB activation by TLR2 in PK-15 cells. (a) PK-15
  cells were co-transfected with pRL-TK and pNF-κB-luc expression plasmids for 24 h.
  Cells were mock treated or stimulated with different MOI (0.1, 1, or 10) of PPV1
  or inactivated PPV1 for 24 h, and cell lysates were analyzed for dual-luciferase
  reporter assays. The ratios were normalized to fold change value. (b) PK-15 cells
  were transfected with negative control siRNA or TLR2 specific siRNAs, then infected
  with PPV1 at an MOI of 1. The mRNA expression levels of NF-κB were analyzed by RT-qPCR.
  Results are expressed as mean ± SD from three independent experiments. *0.01 < p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01
article_title: TLR2-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway is involved in PPV1-induced apoptosis
  in PK-15 cells.
