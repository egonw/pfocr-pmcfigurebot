caption: Vitamin C selectively induces ferroptosis in pancreatic cancer cells. (a)
  Cell viability was assessed by CCK-8 assay after treatment with various concentrations
  of vitamin C. (b) Cell viability was detected by CCK-8 assay after treatment with
  vitamin C with or without different cell death inhibitors. (c) GSH levels were measured
  in BxPC3 cells treated with vitamin C in the presence or absence of DFO. (dâ€“f) Flow
  cytometry was performed to detect lipid ROS levels, and the quantification of fluorescence
  intensity is shown.
