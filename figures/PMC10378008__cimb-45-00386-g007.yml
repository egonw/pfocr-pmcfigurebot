caption: Correlations of PODNL1 expressions with TGF-β signaling. (A) The correlations
  between PODNL1 expressions and TGF-β signaling pathway genes. (B,C) The Metascape
  MCODE networks and the corresponding pathway enrichment analysis identified for
  positively related gene lists (in red column) and negatively ones (in purple column),
  respectively. (D) GeneMANIA protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks of PODNL1
  were analyzed using its positively correlated receptors including TGFBR1, TGFBR2,
  ACVR1, ACVR1C, ACVR2A, ACVR2B, ACVRL1, BMP8A, BMPR2 and ENG. * p < 0.05, ** p <
  0.01.
