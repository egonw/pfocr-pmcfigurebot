caption: 'Analysis of cell differentiation and growth in the RD line expressing a
  myrAkt1 form. (A) Control and myrAkt1 cells (1.5 × 105), seeded into 60 mm dishes,
  were left to proliferate for 48 h before collecting protein samples. Activation
  of Akt1 signaling was determined by IB with the indicated antibodies (n = 2). Data
  are mean ± SEM, *** p-value < 0.0001; one-way Anova test. (B) Under the same conditions
  seen above, cells were seeded on coverslips and stained with fluorescent red phalloidin.
  Representative images were taken using a fluorescent microscope at 63× magnification
  (n = 2). Quantification of the cell area was calculated by using ImagePro Plus software.
  Data are mean ± SEM, *** p-value < 0.0001; one-way Anova test. (C) Control and myrAkt1
  cells (2 × 105), seeded onto coverslips in 60 mm dishes, were left to proliferate
  until reaching confluence (48 h), before treatment with DM (up to 96 h). Then, MHC
  staining was analyzed by IF. Reported quantification is relative to the average
  number of MHC-positive cells resulting from at least 10 different fields (n = 2).
  Data are mean ± SEM, *** p-value < 0.0001; unpaired Student’s t-test. (D) IB for
  detection of MyoD and MHC was performed on proliferating and differentiating cells
  at the indicated times, respectively (n = 2). (E) After seeding the cells (1.5 ×
  104) in 24-multiwell plates, the cell growth was evaluated over a time-course by
  crystal violet incorporation (n = 3). Data are mean ± SEM, *** p-value < 0.0001;
  one-way Anova test. (F) Control and myrAkt1 cells (1 × 105) were seeded into 100
  mm dishes and left to proliferate for 24 h in GM before starvation with a GM supplemented
  with 5% FBS. Ki67 quantitative fluorescence was measured in sorted cells after 72
  h by FACS analysis (n = 2). (G) Control and myrAkt1 cells (1.5 × 104), seeded in
  24-multiwell plates, were left to proliferate in GM for 24 h before acute treatment
  with 10 µM LY294002, 10 µM MK2206, 100 nM rapamycin, 10 µM PD98059, or DMSO vehicle.
  After 72 h of cell growth, crystal violet incorporation was quantified (n = 3).
  Data are mean ± SEM, *** p-value < 0.0001; unpaired Student’s t-test vs. control
  RD line. ## p-value < 0.001; ### p-value < 0.0001; one-way Anova test vs. DMSO-treated
  cells. (H) Control and myrAkt1 cells (1.5 × 105), seeded into 60 mm dishes, were
  maintained for 24 h in GM before acute treatment with 10 µM LY294002, 10 µM MK2206,
  a combination of 5 µM LY294002 and 5 µM MK2206 or a DMSO vehicle. Activation of
  Akt1 signaling was determined by IB with the indicated antibodies after 72 h (n
  = 2). Data are mean ± SEM, *** p-value < 0.0001; one-way Anova test. (I) Pictures
  showing the clonogenic capacity of control and myrAkt1 cells. Single colonies were
  left to grow for 10 days in 6-multiwell plates prior to crystal violet incorporation
  (for details, see Material and Methods). The graph (right panel) shows the crystal
  violet quantification (n = 3). Data are mean ± SEM, *** p-value < 0.0001; one-way
  Anova test. (J) Cell growth was evaluated by clonogenic assay after 2-h pretreatment
  with 10 µM LY294002, 10 µM MK2206, 100 nM rapamycin, or a DMSO vehicle. Quantification
  was performed by crystal violet incorporation (n = 2). Data are mean ± SEM, ***
  p-value < 0.0001; unpaired Student’s t-test vs control RD line. ### p-value < 0.0001;
  one-way Anova test vs. DMSO-treated cells.'
