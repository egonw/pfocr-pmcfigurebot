caption: 'Effects of metformin on the induction of ferroptosis in ox-LDL-treated macrophages.
  (A) Western blot analysis was used to measure the expression levels of Gpx4 and
  Hmox-1 proteins following application of the indicated treatments; GAPDH was used
  as a control for the standardization of the total cellular protein. (B) Quantitative
  analysis of Gpx4 and Hmox-1 levels. (C) The SOD activity levels in macrophages were
  detected by the total SOD activity detection kit, The MDA level levels in macrophages
  were detected by the lipid oxidation (MDA) detection kit. The data are expressed
  as mean ± standard deviation and were representative of three independent experiments.
  (D) Western blot analysis was used to measure the expression levels of Gpx4 and
  Hmox-1 proteins following the indicated treatments; GAPDH was used as a control
  for the standardization of the total cellular protein. (E) Cell viability was assessed
  by the CCK-8 assay. (F) Quantitative analysis of GPX4 and Hmox-1 levels. (G) Determination
  of the SOD and MDA levels in macrophages. ***P<0.001 vs. the PMA group and #P<0.05
  vs. the ox-LDL group, ##P<0.01 vs. the ox-LDL group, ^^P<0.01 vs. the erastin +
  ox-LDL group, $P<0.05 vs. the ferrostatin-1 + ox-LDL group, $$P<0.01 vs. the ferrostatin-1
