figure_title: DLG4 is a direct target of circ_0003215/miR-663b axis in CRC cells
caption: A The intersection of the target genes of miR-663b predicted by miRBase,
  miRWalk, and TargetScan. B The expression of potential miR-663b target genes in
  SW480 cells transfected with miR-663b mimics or circ_0003215-specific siRNA. C The
  expression of potential miR-663b target genes in HT29 cells transfected with miR-663b
  mimics or circ_0003215-specific siRNA. D Immunohistochemistry showed the DLG4 protein
  levels in CRC tissues and normal colorectal mucosa from HPA database. E The expresssion
  level of DLG4 mRNA in SW480 and HT29 cells transfected with circ_0003215 siRNA or
  miR-663b inhibitors. F Western blotting of DLG4 was detected in SW480 cells after
  transfecting with indicated vectors. G Three-dimensional scatter plot of circ_0003215,
  miR-663b and DLG4 in 50 paired CRC and adjacent tissues. H Schematic representation
  of the DLG4 3’-UTR WT and DLG4 3’-UTR MUT luciferase reporter vectors(left). The
  relative luciferase activity in HEK-293T co-transfected with miR-663b mimics or
  NC and the DLG4 3’-UTR WT or MUT reporter vectors (right). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001.
