caption: 'BLCA cells have a selectively open chromatin state at the BCL2 locus and
  undergo BLC2 downregulation upon paclitaxel treatment. (A) Normalized ATAC-seq.
  tracks of the BCL2 locus in 7 representative samples from various cancer types predicted
  to be dependent on BCL2 and sensitive to paclitaxel. Kidney cancer is used as a
  negative control. (B) RT-sqPCR analysis of total RNA extracted from RT4, RT112,
  T24, and TCCSUP cells, seeded at ~60% confluency and exposed to the indicated doses
  (0, 0.1, 1, 5, 10, and 50 μg/mL) of paclitaxel for 24 h. Expression of BCL2 and
  BCL-XL mRNA was analyzed to assess the induction of apoptosis. GAPDH mRNA expression
  was used as a control (n = 3 biological replicates). (C,D) Densitometry analysis
  of the obtained RT-sqPCR results (B). The density of BCL2 and BCL-XL RT-sqPCR bands
  was analyzed and normalized to the density of GAPDH mRNA for each cell line and
  condition examined. A one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s test for multiple hypothesis correction
  ensures the statistical significance of the results. Error bars represent means
  ± SD (n = 3 biological replicates) (n.s.: non-significant). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  and *** p < 0.001. See  for the original images of the Western Blots.'
