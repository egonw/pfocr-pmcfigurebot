caption: GO and KEGG analysis results for the transcriptome and proteome combined
  analysis. (A) DAG concentration diagram of biological process (BP) in GO database.
  (B) DAG concentration diagram of molecular function (MF) in GO database. (C) DAG
  concentration diagram of cellular component (CC) in GO database. (D) Bubble chart
  of GO enrichment results for the transcriptome and proteome combined analysis. (E)
  Histogram of GO enrichment results for the transcriptome and proteome combined analysis.
  (F) Bubble chart of KEGG enrichment results for the transcriptome and proteome combined
  analysis. (G) Histogram of KEGG enrichment results for the transcriptome and proteome
  combined analysis. (In Figure A–C, each node represents a GO term, and branches
  represent inclusion relations, the function range defined from top to bottom is
  getting smaller and smaller, the box represents the GO terms with top10 enrichment
  degree, and the darker the color, the higher the enrichment degree. In Figure D–G,
  rich factor refers to the ratio of the number of differential genes enriched to
  the GO term to the number of genes annotated to the GO term, the larger the Richfactor,
  the greater the degree of enrichment (abscissa), the value range of FDR generally
  ranges from 0 to 1 and the closer it is to 0, the more significant the enrichment
  is.)
