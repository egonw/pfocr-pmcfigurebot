caption: Abnormal microtubule attachments during mitosis. Red-dashed arrows show possible
  errors that can occur during cell replication ultimately leading to mis-segregated
  chromosomes. Here monotelic, syntelic, merotelic and multipolar spindle are represented.
  Absence of attachment and premature loss of sister chromatid cohesion are possible
  origins of W-CIN as well.
