caption: The expression level of genes in NOD-like receptor signaling pathway in different
  immune tissues of the same individual bird with APEC infection. (A) The expression
  level of IL8L2, IL1B, IL18, RIP2, PSTPIP1, NOD1, HSP90B1, CARD9, MAPK1, MAPK11,
  and CASP8 in NOD-like receptor signaling pathway in bone marrow upon APEC infection
  based on the data of GSE67302. (B) The expression level of IL8L2, IL18, IL8L1, MAPK12,
  MAPK11, BIRC2, CARD9, NOD1, and RIP2 in NOD-like receptor signaling pathway in thymus
  upon APEC infection based on the data of GSE69014. (C) The expression level of MAPK8,
  IL18, TRAF6, HSP90AB1, NOD1, RIP2, and ITA in NOD-like receptor signaling pathway
  in bursa upon APEC infection based on the data of GSE70334. (D) The expression level
  of MAPK11, MAPK1, CASP8, ERBB2IP, IL8L2, RIP2, and NOD1 in NOD-like receptor signaling
  pathway in leukocytes in blood upon APEC infection based on the data of GSE31387.
  (E) The expression level of IL1B, IL18, IL6, RIP2, NOD1, and CASP8 in NOD-like receptor
  signaling pathway in spleen upon APEC infection based on the data of GSE25511.
