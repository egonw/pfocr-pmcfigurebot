figure_title: De novo biosynthesis of OG in Y. lipolytica
caption: (a) Metabolic engineering of the OG producing strain. (b) Evaluation of OG,
  TAL, and orcinol produced by engineered strains YL-G1 to YL-G4 in shake flask fermentation.
  All data represent the means of n = 3 biologically independent samples and error
  bars show the standard deviations. The circle represents the raw data and the raw
  data was listed in . (c) Effect of the integration of additional copies of the heterologous
  pathway on the product titer. Digits show the number of integrated additional copies
  of OG biosynthetic genes. All data represent the means of n = 3 biologically independent
  samples and error bars show the standard deviations. The circles represent the raw
  data and the raw data was listed . OG, orcinol glucoside; TAL, triacetic acid lactone.
