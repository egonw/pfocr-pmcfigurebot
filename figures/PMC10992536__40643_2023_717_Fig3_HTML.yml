caption: Metabolic pathway for the production of ethanol from levoglucosan. (1) Levoglucosan
  is transported to the plasma membrane. (2) Levoglucosan is catalyzed by levoglucosan
  kinase (LGK) to yield glucose-6-phosphate in the presence of Mg.2+ and ATP. (3)
  Pyruvate is transformed to acetaldehyde by pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC). (4) Acetaldehyde
  is reduced to ethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase (adh)
article_title: Enhanced bioethanol production by evolved Escherichia coli LGE2-H in
  a microbial electrolysis cell system.
