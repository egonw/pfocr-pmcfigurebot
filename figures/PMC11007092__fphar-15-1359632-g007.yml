caption: Camellia oleifera bud EE induced A549 apoptosis by mitochondria-mediated
  pathway. (A) Mitochondrial membrane potential in Camellia oleifera bud EE-treated
  A549 cells was detected by JC-1 staining and photographed under an inverted fluorescence
  microscope. (B) Western blot detection for the expression levels of Bax, cleaved-caspase
  9, pro-caspase 3, and cleaved-PARP proteins in Camellia oleifera bud EE-treated
  cells. (C) The relative expression levels of related proteins. Results were shown
  as the mean Â± SD. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 versus the control group.
