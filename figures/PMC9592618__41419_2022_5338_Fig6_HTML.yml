figure_title: SIRT1 deacetylated KIF15 mediating integrin β1 recycling and FAK signaling
  activation
caption: A The effect of simultaneously acetylated and phosphorylated (K1009Q + S1169D,
  KIF15-RA) or simultaneously deacetylated and dephosphorylated (K1009Q + S1169A,
  KIF15-QD) on the integrin β1/FAK pathway activity in whole cell lysis by western
  blot. B Phos-Tag and western blot analysis of the phosphorylation KIF15 expression
  level in transfected with acetylation of K1009 inactivating or activating mutant
  PC cells. C Western blot analysis of the effects of acetylation inhibitors on KIF15
  acetylation levels. D Western blot analysis of the effects of different SIRTs siRNA
  on KIF15 acetylation levels. E Co-immunoprecipitation analysis of the interaction
  between KIF15 and SIRT1. F Western blot analysis of the effects of SIRT1-WT or SIRT1-H363Y
  inactive mutation on KIF15 acetylation levels. G The effect of KIF15-WT or K1009
  activating mutant of KIF15 on the integrin β1/FAK pathway activity in the wild-type
  or inactive state of SIRT1 by western blot and the interaction of KIF15, Rab11A,
  Integrin β1, PI3K-C2α by Flag or HA immunoprecipitation assay. H Immunohistochemical
  analysis of the correlation of KIF15 and RAB11A, Integrin β1, PI3K-C2α, SIRT1 in
  pancreatic cancer tissues. All data represent means ± SEM; ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01;
  *P < 0.05; two-tailed Student’s t test.
