caption: Rab22a is overexpressed in thyroid malignancies. GEPIA database showed the
  relationship between the expression of RAB22A with tumors (P = 0.01), BRAF mutations
  (P = 0), and stages (Pr = 0.206) (a). Representative images of Rab22a protein expression
  in papillary thyroid carcinoma, thyroid follicular carcinoma, medullary thyroid
  carcinoma, and nodular goiter tissues (b, 100Ã—). UALCAN analysis showed that the
  patients with high RAB22A expression had poorer overall survival (c).
