caption: Fisetin treatment suppressed nuclear translocation of NF-κB in TNF-α-induced
  BEAS-2B cells. (A) Fisetin regulated NF-κB pathway expression (n = 3 per group).
  (B) The fold expression of pIκBα and p65 in the cytoplasm, and the levels of p65
  in the nucleus. The data presented as mean ± SEM of three independent experiments.
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, compared to the TNF-α-stimulated BEAS-2B cell control.
