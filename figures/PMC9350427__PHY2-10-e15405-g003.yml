caption: Hepatic microarray, gene ontology, and ingenuity pathway analysis. Gene expression
  analysis utilizing microarrays of liver tissue from the high‐capacity runner (HCR)
  and low‐capacity runner (LCR) rats. (a) Global hierarchical condition clustering
  of samples and (b) principal component analysis of RMA normalized gene expression
  values. (c) Venn diagram of differentially expressed genes (±1.5‐fold, p < 0.05)
  following 3‐day HFHS in HCR and LCR rats, respectively. (d) Heatmap representing
  normalized values of the union of differentially expressed genes. (e) Gene ontology
  (GO) analysis of enriched biological processes among differentially expressed genes
  in HCR following HFHS diets. (f) Top network of differentially expressed genes involved
  in sterol and lipid metabolism in HCR following HFHS diets via Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis (IPA). (g) Canonical upstream regulators of bile acid and lipid metabolic
  pathways derived from IPA. n = 8/condition. HFHS, high‐fat/high‐sucrose diet.
article_title: Rats with high aerobic capacity display enhanced transcriptional adaptability
  and upregulation of bile acid metabolism in response to an acute high‐fat diet.
