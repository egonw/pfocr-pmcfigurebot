caption: Identification of differentially abundant transcripts in cisplatin-sensitive
  and cisplatin-resistant HGSOC cells. (A) RNA-seq data filtering flowchart with the
  number of genes filtered in each step. (B) Volcano plots show the global transcriptional
  changes in the pairs of cell lines. The volcano plot (The log2FoldChange of each
  gene is represented on the x-axis, and the log10 of its adjusted p-value is on the
  y-axis. Genes with an adjusted p-value less than 0.05 and a log2FoldChange greater
  than one are indicated by red dots. These represent upregulated genes. Genes with
  an adjusted p-value less than 0.05 and a log2 fold change less than âˆ’1 are indicated
  by blue dots. These represent downregulated genes. (C) Heat map constructed with
  the 414 differentially abundant transcripts from filter-3. (D,E) Ingenuity pathway
  analysis (IPA). The top network (left) included molecules involved in cell survival
  pathways. The top second network (right) includes genes associated with vesicle
  trafficking, phosphorylation, and cGMP signaling. The green and red symbols denote
  downregulated and upregulated genes in the RNA-seq, respectively. Solid lines represent
  direct interactions between molecules, and dashed lines represent indirect interactions.
