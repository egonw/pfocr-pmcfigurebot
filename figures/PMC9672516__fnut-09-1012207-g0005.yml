caption: Effects of tannic acid (TA) on the Nrf2 signaling pathway of IPEC-J2 cells.
  Western blotting analysis of the protein expression of Nrf2, Keap1, and GPX4 is
  shown (A). Quantitative analysis of the protein expression of Nrf2, Keap1, and GPX4
  (B). Data are presented as mean Â± SEM, n = 3. TA, tannic acid; TBH, tert-butyl hydroperoxide.
  a, bvalues in the same row not sharing a common superscript differ significantly.
