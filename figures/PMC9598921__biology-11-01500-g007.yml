caption: Detail chromosome comparisons between LG06, GH14, and GH38, and structure
  variation between female and male O. bidens genomes. (A) The chromosome LG06 of
  male O. bidens genome showed significant synteny with GH14 and GH38 of female O.
  bidens genome. (B) Statistics of the structural variations in various regions of
  the male genome by alignment with female O. bidens genome.
