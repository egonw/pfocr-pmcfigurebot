caption: Pathway and GSEA analysis of the effect of DR on cerebellar transcriptome.
  (A) Selection of significantly altered pathways of DEGs as identified with Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis. Length of bars indicate the −log10(p-value) with the dashed line
  at p = 0.01. Color of bars (z-score) indicates whether and to which degree pathways
  are up- (red) or down-regulated (blue). Green diamonds show the number of DEGs associated
  with the pathway. (B) Graph showing summary of results of gene set enrichment analysis
  (GSEA) with all gene sets from Hallmark, KEGG and Reactome canonical pathways, and
  Gene Ontology (GO) collections. The graph is based on gene sets with p < 0.05 and
  FDR < 0.25 categorized as outlined in . (C–E) Exemplary GSEA graphs illustrating
  enrichment of down-regulated genes in gene sets associated with synaptic transmission
  (C), extra cellular matrix (D), and mTorc1 signaling (E) in DR cerebellar cortex.
  (F–H) GSEA graphs (F,G) and heat map [(H) with z-scores of genes of (G)] illustrating
  enrichment of up-regulated genes in gene sets associated with DNA repair pathways
  in DR cerebellum. In (H) genes in green and brown have FDR and p values <0.05, respectively.
