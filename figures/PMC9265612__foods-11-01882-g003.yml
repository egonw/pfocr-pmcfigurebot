caption: Lipidomic analysis of spleen dendritic cells in control and shrimp allergy
  groups. (A) volcano plot of the 314 lipids profile; (B) principal component analysis
  of the global spleen dendritic cellsâ€™ lipidome demonstrated that the two groups
  (shrimp allergy vs. normal spleen dendritic cells) were clearly distinguished; (C)
  hierarchical clustering heatmap of lipids in normal and shrimp allergy spleen dendritic
  cells; (D,E), KEGG pathway enrichment showed the most altered lipid metabolic pathways
  in shrimp allergy.
