caption: The role of CCL2/CCR2 in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. The expression of
  CCL2 and CCR2 in the ischemic area is increased sharply in neurons, astrocytes,
  microglia, and endothelial cells for 24 h after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. These
  induce neuroinflammation and blood-brain barrier leakage, resulting in neurological
  injury (Left). On the other hand, the migration of neuroblasts to the injured area
  is CCL2/CCR2-dependent (Right). As such, the CCL2/CCR2 signaling pathway promotes
  neuron regeneration and the recovery of neural function after cerebral ischemia.
