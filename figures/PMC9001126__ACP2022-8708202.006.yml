caption: MSCs and MSC-exosomes activated AMPK signaling pathway in the polyploid A549
  and H1299 cells. (a, b) Protein levels of MMP-9, Bcl-xl, Bak, LC3A/B, P62, AMPK,
  and phospho-AMPK (Thr172) in the polyploid A549 and H1299 cells following coculture
  with MSC-CM, MSCs, and MSC-exosomes were determined by Western blot analysis.
