caption: 'CB-5083 treatment is cytotoxic in ovarian cancer cell lines. (A): Ovarian
  cancer cell lines, namely OVCAR5, OVSAHO, OVCAR10, OVCAR8, SKOV3, and RMG1 were
  treated with increasing doses of CB-5083 ranging from 0.1 µM to 25 µM for 72 h.
  Dose–response curves were generated using GraphPad Prism based on the four parameters
  of nonlinear regression. The curves were constrained at the top (100%) and the bottom
  (>0%). Every point in the dose–response curve represents mean ± SEM taken from three
  technical replicates for all cell lines. (B): The bar graph represents mean GI50
  + SEM taken from four biological replicates in all cell lines.'
