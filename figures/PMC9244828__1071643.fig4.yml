caption: Platelet Ca2+ mobilization and Rap-1b activation are defective in PT-VWD.
  (A) Changes in cytosolic free Ca2+ triggered by TRAP-6 10 mM, ADP 5 mM and CVX 50
  ng/mL, as assessed in FLUO 3-AM (8 mM)-labeled platelets. After the measurement
  of baseline fluorescence of PRP samples, agonists were added and changes in green
  fluorescence were recorded in function of time. The graphs show data from one representative
  experiment. Points represent the ratio with respect to baseline mean fluorescence
  intensity (MFI). The columns show maximal Ca2+ rise after stimulation (fluorescence
  ratio) with different agonists. Data are means ± SEM from four independent experiments
  (Online Supplementary Table S1, samples D, E, F, H ) (P<0.05; unpaired t-test).
  (B) Rap1b activation (Rap1b-GTP) of human control and patient (PT-VWD) platelets
  after stimulation with thrombin (0.1 U/mL) or ADP (10 mM) under stirring conditions
  was assessed by western blotting by loading 500 mg of proteins. Densitometric analysis
  was performed using Image J software. Quantification of Rap1b-GTP is relative to
  total RAP1b expression and is expressed in arbitrary units (AU). Data are means
  ± SEM from three independent experiments (Online Supplementary Table S1, samples
  B, D, F) (*P<0.05; two-way ANOVA).
