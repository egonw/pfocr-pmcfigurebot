caption: 'Role of DJ-1 during dicarbonyl stress. In senescent cells, the hyper-glycolitic
  phenotype induces dicarbonyl stress. Left side: In cells treated with Akt inhibitor,
  DJ-1 does not undergo phosphorylation. Unphosphorylated DJ-1 loses its glyoxalase
  activity and is unable to counteract the formation of MGO adducts, accounting for
  chromatin destructuration. Right side: In proliferating cell, under the activation
  of the Akt pathway, DJ-1 undergoes phosphorylation and translocates into the nucleus
  where it acts as glyoxalase. This activity preserves the histones code and the malignant
  proliferative potential.'
