caption: Phytohormonal response of Brassica oleracea primary roots to aboveground
  (AG) herbivory by Brevicoryne brassicae (Bb) or Plutella xylostella (Px) and belowground
  (BG) herbivory by Delia radicum (Dr). Herbivores feeding AG were introduced 2 d
  prior to root infestation by Delia radicum. Fold changes of genes involved in the
  jasmonic acid (JA) pathway relative to control (a), concentrations of JA‐Ile and
  JA; error bars represent standard error of the mean (n = 3–6) (b), fold changes
  of genes involved in ethylene (c), abscisic acid (d) and salicylic acid (e) signalling
  relative to control. Selection of genes and names of homologs are based on Arabidopsis.
  Genes differentially expressed in the uninfested control of that time point are
  indicated by stars (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.0001) and dots (FDR < 0.05).
  In (b), different letters indicate statistical differences between treatments for
  each time point (Tukey's HSD, P < 0.05). C, control; FC, fold change relative to
  control for each time point; hpiDr , hours post infestation by D. radicum; TF, transcription
  factor. For gene expression, n = 4 for each treatment × timepoint combination. GLM,
  generalized linear model.
