caption: 'The view of the interaction between the four different m6A-associated macrophages
  clusters. A: The heatmap showed the correlation of the four m6A-associated macrophages
  by NMF; B: The heatmap displayed the interactions between the m6A-associated macrophages
  clusters and the cancer cells; C: Cell-to-cell interaction network between the m6A-associated
  macrophages and cancer cells; D: The bar-plot revealed the different proportion
  of m6A-associated macrophages clusters in the tumor and normal groups. Eï¼š The correlation
  plot showed the relationship between the different gene signatures with the m6A-associated
  macrophage clusters; F: The heatmap revelated the relationship between the m6A-associated
  macrophage clusters and the immune checkpoint-associated genes; G: G.O. and KEGG
  functional enrichment analysis of the genes in m6A-associated macrophage clusters;
  H: Interactions between the enriched pathways across the genes in m6A-associated
  macrophage clusters. The size of the dots denotes the number of genes in the relevant
  pathway, and the color indicates the cluster type. The paths for the clustering
  category are given in the tab on the label. Dots representing the same enrichment
  route have varied colors based on the p-value given on labels. The deeper the dots,
  the lower the p-value, and the more statistically significant it is. (For interpretation
  of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
  Web version of this article.)'
