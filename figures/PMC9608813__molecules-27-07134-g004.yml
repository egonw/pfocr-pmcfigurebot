caption: 'Effects of hesperidin on migration of human keratinocytes. (A–D) HaCaT keratinocytes
  were treated with vehicle (0.1% DMSO), 5 μM of E. daniellii components (hesperidin,
  vitexin, limonin, myo-inositol, uracil), E. daniellii extract (5 μg/mL), or VPA
  (100 μM) for 24 h. (A,B) The in vitro wound-healing and transwell assays were performed
  as described in the Materials and Methods section. (A) Representative images of
  in vitro wound-healing assay and quantitative measurement of relative wound-closure
  rate. (B) Representative images of transwell assay and quantitative measurement
  of the area of migrated cells. (C) Immunoblotting analysis data. (D) ICC staining
  for β-catenin and total phalloidin. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Arrows
  indicate nucleus-localized β-catenin. (E) Quantitative measurements of intensities
  of β-catenin and phalloidin for the data from the experiments in D (n = 10 taken
  in three different images). (F,G) HaCaT keratinocytes transfected with β-catenin
  siRNA or negative control for 12 h. After transfection, HaCaT keratinocytes treated
  with vehicle (0.1% DMSO), hesperidin (1, 5 μM), or E. daniellii extract (5 μg/mL)
  for 24 h. (F) Immunoblotting analysis data for transfected keratinocytes. (G) Representative
  images of in vitro wound-healing assay of transfected keratinocytes and quantitative
  measurement of wound-closure rate. Original magnification: (A,B), ×40; (D), ×400.
  Values are expressed as means ± SEM. ** p < 0.005; *** p < 0.0005, significantly
  different from vehicle, control, or as indicated.'
