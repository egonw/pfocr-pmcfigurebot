caption: 'RRP9 promotes tumor growth and chemoresistance to gemcitabine via AKT signaling
  pathway in PC. A Luminescence signal of xenografted tumors formed by vector, RRP9-OE
  and RRP9-OE + AKT inhibitor-treated cells in mice after gemcitabine treatment. B
  Tumor volumes (left) and tumor weights (right) of xenografted tumors. Data are expressed
  by mean ± SD, n = X. C Representative images showing TUNEL staining of vector-,
  RRP9-OE- and RRP9-OE + AKT inhibitor-treated tumor sections after gemcitabine treatment
  (50 μM). Scale bars: 100 μm (left panel). Quantification of percentage of apoptotic
  cells. Data are given as mean ± SD, n = 3 (right panel). Note: *p < 0.05'
