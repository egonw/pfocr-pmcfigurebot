figure_title: Proximal tubule TβRII deletion increases the Th1 inflammatory response
  6 weeks after AA injury
caption: a Metacore pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes in injured
  PT clusters showing the top 10 significantly affected pathways in γGT-Cre;Tgfbr2fl/fl
  compared to Tgfbr2fl/fl 6 weeks after AA injury. b–d FACS analyses of renal leukocytes
  showing significant increase of CD4 + T cell number in kidneys of γGT-Cre;Tgfbr2fl/fl
  mice compared to those from their Tgfbr2fl/fl littermates 6 weeks after AA injury;
  n = 6 (Tgfbr2fl/fl) and 6 (γGT-Cre;Tgfbr2fl/fl) mice, p = 0.0085. CD8+ T cell numbers
  were increased in injured Tgfbr2fl/fl compared to γGT-Cre;Tgfbr2fl/fl kidneys, but
  did not reach statistical significance; n = 6 (Tgfbr2fl/fl) and 6 (γGT-Cre;Tgfbr2fl/fl)
  mice, p = 0.0984. e–h FACS analyses of renal leukocytes showing a significant increase
  of the number of IFNγ and TNFα producing CD4+ T cells in kidneys of γGT-Cre;Tgfbr2fl/fl
  mice compared to those from their Tgfbr2fl/fl littermates 6 weeks after AA injury;
  n = 6 (Tgfbr2fl/fl) and 6 (γGT-Cre;Tgfbr2fl/fl) mice, p = 0.0027 (IFNγ)and p = 0.0016
  (TNFα). IFNγ and TNFα producing CD8 + T cell numbers were not statistically different
  between genotypes; n = 6 (Tgfbr2fl/fl) and 6 (γGT-Cre;Tgfbr2fl/fl) mice, p = 0.0519
  (IFNγ) and p = 0.2419 (TNFα). i–k Cgas/Sting immunoblotting and quantification showing
  significantly increased expressions in renal cortices of γGT-Cre;Tgfbr2fl/fl mice
  compared to those from their Tgfbr2fl/fl littermates 6 weeks after AA injury; n = 6
  (Tgfbr2fl/fl) and 6 (γGT-Cre;Tgfbr2fl/fl) mice, Cgas p = 0.185 and Sting p = 0.0061.
  α-Tubulin was used as loading and blotting control. Data are presented as mean values ± SEM.
  Statistical significance was determined by unpaired Student’s t test (two groups)
  or two-way ANOVA followed by Sidak’s multiple comparisons test, with p < 0.05 considered
  statistically significant. The dots represent the number of animals per group. *p < 0.05;
  **p < 0.01. Source data are provided as a Source data file.
