caption: Cell communication in spinal cord after SCI. Expression of receptors and
  ligands in the CCL and COMPLEMENT signaling pathways (A) and (B). The diameter of
  the circle denotes the percentage of a cell type's cells that express a certain
  gene, and the intensity of the color denotes the degree of that expression. Between
  cells in the SCI, the CCL signaling pathway (C) and the COMPLEMENT signaling pathway
  (D). The strength of the signal is determined by the intercellular lines' thickness;
  the thicker the line, the stronger the signal intensity.
