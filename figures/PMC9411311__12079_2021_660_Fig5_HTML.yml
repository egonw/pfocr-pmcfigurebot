caption: GM targets and specifically inhibits only signaling pathway involving LCK
  in T cells. a Coomassie brilliant blue staining for equal loading of proteins. b
  Western blot analysis of phosphorylation status of signaling proteins involved in
  proximal T cell receptor signal transduction pathway in T cells pre-incubated with
  GM and stimulated with different stimuli. ERK 1/2, a downstream signaling molecule
  in TCR signaling pathway, is activated (phosphorylated) either through CD3/CD28
  antibodies mediated via LCK-ZAP70- LAT ( +) or by PMA (P#). Thus, there was an increase
  in phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 when stimulated with CD3/CD28 antibodies ( +) or with
  PMA (P#) compared to unstimulated cells (-). Pre-incubation of the cells with GM
  inhibited only LCK-mediated increase in ERK 1/2 and not PMA-mediated increase in
  phosphorylation (GM + Vs GMP#)
