caption: Effect of DUSP1 knockdown on DUSP1, TNF-α and IL-1β in BCG-induced THP-1
  cells. (A, E, H) THP-1 cells were transfected with three different targeting siRNA-DUSP1
  for 24 h, and knockdown was verified by Western blotting and RT-qPCR. (B, C, F,
  I) THP-1 cells were transfected with siRNA-NC (negative control) or siRNA-DUSP1
  for 24 h and then infected with BCG for 6 h, and the knockdown effect was verified
  by immunofluorescence, Western blotting and RT-qPCR to verify the effect of DUSP1
  knockdown. Scale bar, 75 μm. (D) Observation of siRNA-DUSP1 transfection efficiency
  by fluorescence microscopy. Scale bar, 150 μm. (G, J) THP-1 cells were transfected
  with siRNA-NC (negative control) or siRNA-DUSP1 for 24 h and then infected with
  BCG for 6 h. Expression of TNF-α and IL-1β was detected by RT-qPCR. All data are
  represented as mean ± SD (n = 3). (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).
