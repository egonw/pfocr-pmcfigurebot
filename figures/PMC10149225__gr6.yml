caption: Periostin activates autophagy by inhibiting mTORC1 pathway in response to
  alcohol exposure. (A–C) The mRNA levels of genes related to ER stress (A), fatty
  oxidation (B), and fat synthesis (C) in WT and Postn-/- mouse livers after pair
  diet or EtOH feeding (n = 4–6 mice per group). (D, F) Western blot analysis of autophagy
  and mTORC1 pathway-related proteins in WT and Postn-/- mouse livers after control
  or ethanol feeding. (E, G) Western blot analysis of the indicated proteins in Ad-Postn/Postn-/-
  and Ad-GFP/Postn-/- mouse livers after control or EtOH feeding. Data represent the
  mean ± standard deviation (3 independently repeated experiments); ∗P < .05; ∗∗P
  < .01; ∗∗∗P < .001; n.s., not significant (Student t test).
