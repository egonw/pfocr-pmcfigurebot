caption: Activation of Wnt signaling pathway attenuated the adverse effects of Cd2+
  on zebrafish early development. (A) Schematic design for the following study. (B,C)
  High-throughput tracking (representative images) of zebrafish early development,
  and the duration for embryos in different groups to reach certain stages. (D–F)
  Heart rate, rate of deformed individuals, and body length of 6 dpf zebrafish in
  different groups. (G) Representative morphological characteristics of zebrafish
  larvae in each group. The values are presented in boxplots (median and mean, whiskers
  show 90% confidence levels) or in histograms (mean ± SEM). The results of either
  nonparametric test or ANOVA followed by multiple comparison test are listed in .
  “*” indicates significant differences (* p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001).
