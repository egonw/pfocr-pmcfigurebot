caption: Inhibition of autophagy reduced snake venom-induced cell death. (A and B)
  SW480 cells were treated with 1 μg/ml snake venom for 24 h in the absence or presence
  of lysosomal inhibitor HC Q (5 μM). The viability of the snake venom- treated cells
  was measured by MTT assay (A) or LDH release assay (B). The data are presented as
  mean ± SD from three independent experiments. *** P < 0.05. (C) Representative fluorescence
  microscopy images showing nuclear staining for DAPI (blue) and TUNEL positive (Ggreen)
  in cells treated with 1 μg/ml snake venom for 24 h in the absence or presence of
  the autophagy inhibitor HCQ (5 μM). Scale bar, 50 μm. The number of stained positive
  cells was counted in three different fields and averaged. Data are presented as
  mean ± SD from three independent experiments. *** P < 0.05. (D) SW480 cells were
  treated with 1 μg/ml snake venom for 24 h in the absence or presence of HCQ (5 μM).
  The indicated protein levels were evaluated by immunoblotting.
