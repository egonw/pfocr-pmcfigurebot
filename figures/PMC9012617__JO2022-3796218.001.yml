caption: SMYD2 expression is up-regulated in patients with lung cancer. High expression
  of SMYD2 is associated with poor prognosis of patients. (a) RT-qPCR was used to
  detect the relative expression of SMYD2 in 20 NSCLC tissues and matched adjacent
  normal tissues. (b) RT-qPCR was used to analyze the expression level of SMYD2 in
  NSCLC cell line and normal bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B. (c) High expression
  level of SMYD2 is associated with poor prognosis of lung cancer (n = 502). ∗P <
  0.05 and∗∗P < 0.01.
