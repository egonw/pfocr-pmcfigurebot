caption: Strigolactone biosynthetic pathway. Biosynthesis of diverse canonical strigolactones
  (SLs) starting from all‐trans‐β‐carotene being converted to carlactone (CL) by isomerase
  DWARF27 (D27), and carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases CCD7, CCD8. Converting CL to
  carlactonoic acid (CLA) is a conserved function of CYP711As. In addition, A2‐type
  CYP711As convert CLA to 18‐hydroxycarlactonoic acid (18‐OH‐CLA) and 4‐deoxyorobanchol
  (4DO), and A3‐type CYP711As can convert 4DO to orobanchol. CYP722C group I can convert
  CLA to orobanchol and CYP722C group II can convert CLA to 5‐deoxystrigol (5DS).
  A CYP728B from sorghum has been shown to convert 5DS to sorgomol. The sulfotransferase
  LGS1 can convert 18‐OH‐CLA to 4DO and 5DS. In addition to the canonical SLs with
  the tricyclic lactone‐ring structure (ABC ring), a variety of noncanonical bioactive
  SLs is found in nature, such as bryosymbiol synthesized by CYP711As in Marchantia
  paleacea (Mpa). Solid arrows indicate where a single pathway is seen; dotted arrows
  indicate two alternative pathways catalyzed by the same enzyme.
