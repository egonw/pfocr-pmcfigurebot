caption: 'Hypothesized rTMS Intracellular Effects on the Glu/GABA-Gln Pathway. A schematic
  representation of hypothesized rTMS intracellular effects on the Glu/GABA-Gln cycle,
  overlaid on neural-astrocyte Glu/GABA-Gln pathway of . A: In the Glu-Gln pathway,
  green arrows represent rTMS-induced increases in glucose, phosphate-activated glutaminase
  (PAG), and glutamine synthetase (GS), leading to tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
  upregulation and increased intracellular glutamate (Glu) and glutamine (Gln) production.
  B: In the GABA-Gln pathway, green arrows represent rTMS-induced increases in glucose,
  phosphate-activated glutaminase (PAG), glutamine synthetase (GS), and glutamate
  decarboxylase (GAD) leading to tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle upregulation and increased
  intracellular GABA and glutamine (Gln) production. (For interpretation of the references
  to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this
  article.)'
