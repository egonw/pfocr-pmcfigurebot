caption: re-ApoE3 remedied the loss of regulatory ability of melatonin on macrophage
  polarization and oxidative injury. (a) Western blot images of the expression of
  ApoE, LDLR, iNOS, and Arg1 to β-actin in wild-type (WT) and ApoE-/- BMDMs infected
  by influenza A (H3N2) (MOI = 2, 12 h) with/without melatonin pretreatment or combined
  pretreatment of melatonin and recombinant ApoE3 (10 μg/ml, 3 h before H3N2 infection).
  (b) Representative immunofluorescence images of F4/80 (red), iNOS (green), and Arg1
  (green) expression in WT and ApoE-/- BMDMs (original magnification ×400). Quantitative
  RT-PCR measurement of the relative mRNA levels of TNF-α (c), MCP1 (d), CD86 (e),
  Arg1 (f), Fizz1 (g), CD206 (h), and IL-1β (j) in WT and ApoE-/- BMDMs. (i) Intracellular
  ROS levels were quantificationally detected by DCFH-DA using a fluorescence plate
  reader in WT and ApoE-/- BMDMs. (k) Western blot images of the expression of NLRP3,
  Caspase1, and GSDMD-N to β-actin in WT and ApoE-/- BMDMs. (l) The lactic dehydrogenase
  (LDH) released into the medium was assessed based on OD490 values of LDH release
  in WT and ApoE-/- BMDMs. Data expressed as mean ± SEM (n ≥ 3). ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p <
  0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001 compared with influenza A- (H3N2-) infected WT or ApoE-/-
  BMDMs.
