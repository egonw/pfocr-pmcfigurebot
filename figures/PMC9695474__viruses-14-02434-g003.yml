caption: Schematic diagram of PEDV evading the host innate-immune signaling pathway.
  On the one hand, PEDV infection activates the host innate-immune signaling pathway.
  On the other hand, PEDV proteins exert inhibitory effects at different stages of
  the host innate immune response. Interaction of PEDV components with host proteins
  is indicated by dotted lines; downstream activation is indicated by black arrows;
  inhibition or degradation of target genes is indicated by red lines ending in dashes.
