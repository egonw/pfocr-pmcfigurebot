caption: CEBPB is closely associated with immune response in metastatic SKCM tumor
  tissue. (A) Volcano plot of differential expression analysis between the 10 metastatic
  SKCM patients with the highest CEBPB expression (CEBPB_High) and the 10 with the
  lowest CEBPB expression (CEBPB_Low) from TCGA-SKCM cohort. Green, red, and gray
  dots represent significant downregulated, upregulated, and non-significant genes
  in CEBPB_High samples compared with CEBPB_Low samples. x-Axis and y-axis are log2FC
  and log10-based FDR-adjusted p-value, respectively. (B) The top 20 most significantly
  enriched KEGG pathways of the 2,039 DEGs in CEBPB_High samples. Dot size and color
  illustrate the number of genes included in the corresponding pathway and significance,
  respectively. Full list of significant KEGG pathways is provided in . (C) Enrichment
  plot of three hallmark gene sets that are significantly enriched and specifically
  activated in the CEBPB_High samples compared with CEBPB_Low samples. The full list
  of significantly enriched gene sets in CEBPB_High samples is provided in . SKCM,
  skin cutaneous melanoma; FDR, false discovery rate; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of
  Genes and Genomes; DEGs, differentially expressed genes.
