caption: (A,B) A total of 560 differentially expressed genes were significantly up-regulated,
  and 339 genes were down-regulated. (C,D) The TGF-β signaling pathway was down-regulated
  after MPP7 was inhibited. The TGF-β signaling pathway was significantly correlated
  with MPP7. (E,F) The enrichment analysis of GO biological processes suggested that
  wound healing was one of the down-regulated functional plates, and the expression
  levels of FGFR2 and TGF-β decreased, which was consistent with bioinformatic predictions.
