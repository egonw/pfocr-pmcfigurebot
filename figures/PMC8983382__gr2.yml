caption: 'Schematic illustration of how copper promotes angiogenesis. The pro-angiogenetic
  signaling pathway affected by copper is the regulation of HIF-1α degradation, where
  copper inhibits the hydroxylation of prolyl residues to maintain the intracellular
  concentration of active HIF-1α. Copper also influences the combination between HIF-1
  transcriptional complex and HRE sites. It was also speculated that copper also directly
  actives HIF-1α via downregulating the expression of GSK-3β. Abbreviations: HIF:
  hypoxia-inducible facto; PHD: prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing protein; VHF:
  von Hippel–Lindau protein; GSK-3β: glycogen synthase kinase-3β; CBP: CREB-binding
  protein; the red straight line with arrow means activation; the green straight line
  with straight-arrow means inhibition; the green truncated line with straight-arrow
  means inhibition under speculation.'
