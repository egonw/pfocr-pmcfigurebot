caption: MAP3K4 kinase inactivation results in reduced expression and basal phosphorylation
  of the IGF1R and IR.A, phospho-RTK array of TSWT and TSKI cells showing tyrosine
  phosphorylation of 39 different RTKs spotted in duplicate shown at either short
  or long exposure times. Each blot has 3 pairs of internal controls (C). B, kinase
  inactivation of MAP3K4 in TS cells results in reduced total and phosphorylated IGF1Rβ
  and IRβ. Site 1 represents pIGF1Rβ Tyr1131 and pIRβ Tyr1146, site 2 represents IGF1Rβ
  Tyr1135 and pIRβ Tyr1150, and site 3 represents pIGF1Rβ Tyr1136 and pIRβ Tyr1151.
  C–F, densitometry was used to quantify 3 biologically independent experiments. Expression
  was normalized to ERK2 (C), and phosphorylation was normalized to ERK2 (D), total
  IGF1Rβ (E), or total IRβ (F). Data show the mean ± SD of 3 biologically independent
  experiments. G, Igf1r transcripts are reduced in TSKI cells relative to TSWT cells.
  qPCR data normalized to Rps11 are expressed as a fold change relative to TSWT cells
  and are the mean ± SD of five biologically independent experiments. A and B, images
  are representative of 3 biologically independent experiments. ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01;

  growth factor 1 receptor; IR, insulin receptor; KI, kinase inactive; MAP3K4, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase kinase 4; ns, not significant; qPCR, quantitative PCR; RTK,
  receptor tyrosine kinase; TS, trophoblast stem.
