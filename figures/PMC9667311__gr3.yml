caption: 'Altered13C and/or15N incorporation into UTP/UDP-GlcNAc and their moieties
  in response to selenite in A549 spheroids or to arsenite transformation in BEAS-2B
  cells.A, A549 Spheroids. B, BEAS-2B cells. 13C and/or 15N atoms were traced from
  [13C6]-Glc (A) or [13C5,15N2]-Gln (B) into UDP-GlcNAc. ●: 12C; : 14N; : 15N; , ,
  : 13C from the first turn of the PDH, PCB, and ME-mediated Krebs cycle reactions,
  respectively. The same sets of extracts as in  were analyzed by IC-UHR-MS1 and DI-MS2.
  A-a, B-a and A-d, B-d: determined from MS1 of UTP/UDP-GlcNAc; A-b to c/f and B-b
  to c/f: determined from the MS2 of the ribose and uracil moieties of UTP and UDP-GlcNAc
  in A549 spheroid and BEAS-2B cells, respectively; A-e and B-e: determined from the
  MS2 of the GlcNAc moiety of UDP-GlcNAc in A549 spheroid and BEAS-2B cells, respectively.
  The X-/Y-axes and number of replicates are as in . Ac, acetyl; CP, carbamoyl phosphate;
  GlcNAc1 or 6P, N-acetylglucosamine 1 or 6-phosphate; GLS, glutaminase; HBP, hexosamine
  biosynthesis pathway; ME, malic enzyme; OMP, orotidine monophosphate; PC, pyruvate
  carboxylase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; Pyr, pyruvate. ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01;
