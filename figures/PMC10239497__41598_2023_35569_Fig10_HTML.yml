caption: Summary of Wnt-related signaling pathways governing osteogenic differentiation
  of hPDLSCs treated with IL-6. The infographic illustrates potential Wnt-related
  signaling pathways involved in osteogenic differentiation of hPDLSCs treated with
  IL-6 in vitro. IL-6 employed the canonical Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway via either WNT2B
  or WNT10B to benefit the osteogenic differentiation potential of hPDLSCs in vitro.
  Besides, IL-6 may rely on the non-canonical Wnt pathway via WNT5A to promote osteogenic
  differentiation of hPDLSCs in vitro.
