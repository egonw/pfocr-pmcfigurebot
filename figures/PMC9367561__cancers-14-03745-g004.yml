caption: Differentially expressed genes and signaling pathway activity in 24-miRNA
  signature predicted HPV-positive versus HPV-negative HNSCC. (A) Heat map top 25
  up-/down-regulated differentially expressed genes (adjusted p-value < 0.1 and |log2
  fold change| > 0.5) in 24-miRNA signature positive and p16/HPV DNA-positive (n =
  15) versus 24-miRNA signature negative and p16/HPV DNA-negative (n = 15) HNSCC of
  the LMU-KKG cohort. Heat map colours indicate mRNA expression z-scores on a scale
  of âˆ’3 to 3. (B) Boxplots illustrate signaling pathway activity derived by progeny
  analysis of differentially expressed genes (n = 658) in 24-miRNA-positive/HPV-positive
  (n = 15) and 24-miRNA-negative/HPV-negative (n = 15) HNSCC. Interquartile ranges
  with median centre lines are shown. FDR adjusted p-values are given.
