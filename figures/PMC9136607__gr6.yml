caption: 'Functional enrichment of IMPA2-correlated co-expression genes. (A) GO and
  pathway enrichment analysis of IMPA2 co-expressed genes. The top 20 pathway enrichment
  clusters based on Metascape analysis of IMPA2 co-expressed genes carried out with
  GO Biological Processes, Reactome Gene Sets and CORUM. Length of bars represent
  log10 (p-value) determined by the best-scoring term within each cluster; (B) GSEA
  for IMPA2 co-expressed genes in the GSE39582 dataset. Abbreviations: GO, Gene Ontology
  Term; GSEA, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis; IMPA2, inositol Mono-phosphatase 2.'
