caption: SSPCs increase NAD(H) pool and NAD+ regeneration by glycolysis side pathway
  and TCA cycle rerouting(A) Flow-cytometry analysis of BrdU+ SSPCs treated with vehicle
  (veh) or 10 μM AMA for 12 h or 24 h (n = 3).(B) NAD+ levels after treatment for
  indicated times (n = 4).(C) Nampt mRNA levels after treatment for indicated times
  (n = 4).(D) Flow-cytometry analysis of BrdU+ SSPCs treated for 24 h or 48 h with
  veh or AMA with or without 10 nM FK866 (n = 8).(E) Metabolite levels of pyruvate,
  lactate, alanine, and glycerol-3-phosphate (glycerol-3-P) after treatment for 3 days
  (n = 8).(F) Glycolytic flux (n = 3).(G) Fractional contribution of 13C6-glucose
  to lactate, alanine, and glycerol-3-P (n = 8).(H) Metabolite levels of citrate,
  α-ketoglutarate (αKG), succinate (suc), fumarate (fum), malate, and 2-hydroxyglutarate
  (2HG) after treatment for 3 days (n = 11–15).(I) Fractional contribution of 13C5-glutamine
  to citrate, αKG, suc, fum, malate, and 2HG (n = 8).(J) Schematic representation
  of 13C5-glutamine labeling patterns. Empty circles indicate 12C, black circles denote
  13C derived from oxidative metabolism, and gray circles denote 13C derived from
  reductive metabolism.(K and L) Oxidative (K) and reductive (L) contribution of 13C5-glutamine
  to suc, fum, malate, and citrate (n = 8).(M) Fractional contribution of 13C6-glucose
  to citrate, αKG, suc, fum, malate, and 2HG (n = 8).(N) Schematic representation
  of 13C6-glucose labeling patterns. Empty circles indicate 12C, black circles denote
  13C entering TCA cycle via pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), and gray circles denote
  13C entering TCA cycle via pyruvate carboxylase (PC).(O and P) M + 2 (O) and M +
  3 (P) contribution of 13C6-glucose to citrate, αKG, suc, fum, and malate (n = 8).(Q
  and R) Pcx mRNA levels (Q, n = 3) and immunoblot detection of PC and β-actin (R).
  Representative image of three experiments is shown.(S) Schematic representation
  of [3,4]-13C2-glucose labeling of TCA cycle intermediates. Empty circles indicate
  12C, black circles denote 13C entering TCA cycle via PC activity.(T) M + 1 contribution
  of [3,4]-13C2-glucose to citrate, malate, fum, and suc.Data are means ± SD. ∗p < 0.05,
  ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001 versus veh-treated cells (paired two-tailed
  Student’s t test), $p < 0.05 (two-way ANOVA). See also .
