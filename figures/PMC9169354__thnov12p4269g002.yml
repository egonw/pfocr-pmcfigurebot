caption: Diagrammatic illustration of circRNAs regulating the Hippo-YAP signaling
  pathway. (A) The Hippo pathway is triggered in response to a wide variety of physical,
  mechanical and biochemical signals, or by FAT family of Cadherins (FAT1-4), thus
  regulating diverse biological processes and pathological states including cancer.
  (B) hsa_circ_000585 binds to miR-615-5p and modulates AMOT activity in cholangiosarcoma.
  (C) circLARP4 and circRNA_0000140 regulate LATS1/2 expression by sponging miR-424-5p
  and miR-31 in gastric cancer and oral squamous cell carcinoma, respectively. (D)
  Hsa_circ0091074 controls TAZ activity by forming an endogenous sponge for miR-1297.
  (E) Hsa_circ_0023404, circPPP1R12A, circRNA_104075, circDDYL, circFAT1, circ0106714,
  circRNA_000585, and hsa_circ_0005273 act as sponges for miRNAs in cervical cancer,
  colon cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, multiple myeloma, osteosarcoma, colorectal
  cancer, cholangiosarcoma, and breast cancer, respectively. In contrast, circYAP
  inhibits YAP1 translation through protein binding mechanisms and acts as tumor suppressor
  in breast and liver cancers. (F) circPVT1 binds to miR-497-5p and alters the activity
  of the YAP/TEAD complex in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
