caption: 'Common gene expression changes in CBD-treated SK-N-BE (2) neuroblastoma
  cells, hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and primary glioma stem cells. (A) Gene expression
  data were obtained from the NCBI GEO Database Series GSE151512 for SK-N-BE(2) cells,
  Series GSE179661 for hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2 and MHCC97H), and Series GSE57978
  for glioma stem cells. SK-N-BE (2) cells were treated with 20 µM CBD or vehicle
  (ethanol) for 24 h (n = 4). Three primary glioma stem cell lines were cultured as
  neurospheres and treated with 2 µM CBD or vehicle (ethanol) for 48 h (n = 3). Hepatocellular
  carcinoma cells were treated with 40 µM CBD for 24 h (n = 2). Significantly differentially
  expressed genes in each dataset were compared (p ≤ 0.05). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  (IPA Qiagen) was used to create a network of known interactions between the differentially
  expressed genes common to both studies. The average fold change of common differentially
  expressed genes is shown. (B) Functional gene ontology classification of genes shown
  in (A) according to their gene ontology “Pathway” or (C) “Protein class” terms (pantherdb.org).
