caption: Porcine intestinal monolayer organoids are susceptible to PDCoV infection.
  (A) Development of porcine intestinal organoids from day 0 to day 7 as observed
  by light microscopy. (B) Growth of 2D intestinal monolayer organoids from day 1
  to day 4 as observed by light microscopy. (C) Viral replication in 2D intestinal
  monolayer organoids was quantified by RT-qPCR at different times postinfection (MOI = 0.1).
  (D) Viral replication in intestinal monolayer organoids was quantified by RT-qPCR
  at 24 hpi (MOI = 1). (E) 2D intestinal monolayer organoids were infected with PDCoV
  (MOI = 1) for 24 h. PDCoV-N protein appears red and nuclei appear blue in IFA; cytopathic
  effect (CPE) could be seen by light microscopy. (F to I) The mRNA levels of IFN-β
  and IFN-λ and interferon-stimulated genes ISG-15 and MX-1 from uninfected and PDCoV-infected
  (MOI = 1) intestinal monolayer organoids. (J) Transepithelial electrical resistance
  (TEER) was measured across the monolayer enteroid. (K) Schematic of the Transwell
  coculture system for the monolayer enteroids and ST cells. (L) PDCoV-N mRNA levels
  from the upper chamber of monolayer enteroids were assessed by RT-qPCR. (M) TEER
  values from PDCoV and mock-infected monolayer enteroids. (N) CPE of PDCoV-infected
  ST cells (in the lower chamber) as observed by light microscopy. White arrows indicate
  the lesions in the ST cells. Scale bar = 50 μm. (O) PDCoV-N RNA levels of the ST
  cells from the lower chamber were assessed by RT-qPCR. (P to S) mRNA levels of tight-junction-related
  genes, ZO-1, occludin, claudin-1, and claudin-5, from uninfected and PDCoV-infected
  (MOI = 1) intestinal monolayer organoids. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01.
