caption: 'Activation of the Nrf2 signalling pathway with tBHQ inhibited NADPH oxidase
  activity and attenuated ROS production in HG-treated podocytes. (A) HK-2 cells were
  pretreated with different concentrations of tBHQ (0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 μM) for 2
  h and then treated with HG for 24 h. Cell viability was assessed using a CCK-8 assay.
  (∗P < 0.05 vs. NG group, #P < 0.05 vs. HG group). (B) Podocytes were pretreated
  with tBHQ (20 μM) for 2 h and then treated with or without HG for 24 h. The cells
  were incubated with Nrf2 antibody and DAPI. (C) Quantitative analysis of the relative
  fluorescence intensity of Nrf2. (D) Western blot analysis of nuclear Nrf2 expression
  in podocytes treated as indicated above. (E) Western blot analysis of Nrf2, HO-1,
  NOX2 and NOX4 expression in podocytes treated as indicated above. (F) Quantification
  of nuclear Nrf2 expression. (G–J) Quantification analysis of nuclear Nrf2, HO-1,
  NOX2 and NOX4 expression from Panel E. (K) Podocytes were treated as indicated above,
  and NADPH oxidase activity was determined using an NADPH oxidase activity assay
  kit. (L) Podocytes were treated as indicated above, and intracellular ROS production
  was measured with DCFH-DA staining. (M) Quantitative analysis of the relative fluorescence
  intensity of DCFH-DA. (∗P < 0.05 vs. NG group, #P < 0.05 vs. tBHQ group, and △P
  < 0.05 vs. HG group.) The uncropped images of (D and E) were referred to in supplementary
  Figure 3.'
