figure_title: Proteomics analysis of proteins differentially expressed in ADT-OH-treated
  cells
caption: 'a MetaCoreTM GeneGo Pathway Maps was used to analyze the ontological categories
  of differentially expressed proteins in MEF cells treated with or without ADT-OH.
  b The protein network associated with cell adhesion and migration is differentially
  expressed in MEF cells treated with ADT-OH. Higher definition image is shown in
  Supplementary Fig. . c The network objects involved in Pathway Maps analyzed by
  MetaCoreTM GeneGo Pathway Maps software. d The GeneGO pathway shows changes in the
  expression of proteins involved in FAK/Paxillin signaling.  The various proteins
  on the map are represented by different symbols (representing the functional categories
  of proteins). Higher definition image is shown in Supplementary Fig. . The symbol
  next to the thermometer shaded in blue or red indicates the protein identified in
  this study: blue indicates the protein that is downregulated in ADT-OH treated MEF
  cells relative to MEF negative control cells (treated with vehicle). Red represents
  up-regulated protein.'
