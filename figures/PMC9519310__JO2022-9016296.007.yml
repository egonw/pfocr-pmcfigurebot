caption: Schematic illustration of the interaction between the IFNγ/JAK/STAT1 and
  JAK/STAT3 signalling pathways. The abnormal activation of the downstream JAK/STAT3
  pathway in the EGFR mutation cell may have antagonistic effects on the STAT1 induced
  anti-tumor immune response, which may cause the IFNγ-JAK-STAT1 pathway to lose its
  function, resulting in the production of the immune tolerance of the EGFR mutant,
  which promotes immune escape. Summary diagram of molecular mechanism of the interaction
  between the IFNγ/JAK/STAT1 and JAK/STAT3 signalling pathways in lung cancer cells.
