figure_title: 'Wnt dependency confirmed through the utilization of Wnt pathway inhibitors:
  ETC159, C59'
caption: 'All growth is expressed as percent viability respective to control (no drug).
  For all Wnt pathway inhibition assays, organoids were grown in minimal growth media
  (Panc129: ENRA, Panc193: ENRAS, Panc269: R, Panc271: NRA, Panc308: ENRA, Panc272:
  media alone, Panc268: A, Panc320: ENA). Each was then treated with either 1uM or
  10uM of Wnt inhibitor, ETC-159 and C59 were utilized in this study. W = 50% Wnt3a.
  E = 50 ng/ml EGF. N = Noggin. R = R-spondin. A = 500 nM A38-01 (ALK inhibitor).
  S = 10 uM SB202190 (p53 MAPK inhibitor). ND = no drug. Ctl: = control (no drug).
  Statistical analysis was done via one-way ANOVA.'
