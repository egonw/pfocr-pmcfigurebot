caption: 'Multi-omics subtypes of PDAC patients. A Consensus-clustering analysis of
  proteomic profiling identifying three proteomic subtypes: S-I (blue, n = 57), S-II
  (pink, n = 106) and S-III (yellow, n = 54). The associations of proteomic subtypes
  with mutation information and clinical characteristics are annotated in the middle
  panel. The heatmap depicts the relative abundance of signature proteins (bottom).
  B The association of three proteomic subtypes with clinical outcomes in 217 PDAC
  samples (log-rank test). OS, overall survival; DFS, disease free survival. C Gene
  Ontology (GO) terms enriched in the three proteomic subtypes. D, E Spearman-rank
  correlation of CNA and protein that highly expressed in S-III. The significant correlations
  are colored in pink, and prognostic related proteins are labeled with purple circles
  (D). The cis-effect of GRB7 among CNA and protein is shown in (E). F P values for
  the correlation between IRF6 protein expression and prognosis in six kinds of gastrointestinal
  tumors in TCGA data. G Spearman-rank correlation of the abundance of GRB7 protein
  and GSVA score. Pink, cell cycle; purple, ERBB signaling pathway; blue, apoptosis.
  H The Venn plot on the left depicting the activated kinases in S-III and heatmaps
  on the right showing the global abundance and the kinase activity score of these
  selected kinases. For each kinase, the P value of its global abundance and kinase
  activity among three subtypes are shown in the center panel. I Spearman-rank correlation
  of the abundance of GRB7 and AKT2. J The boxplot indicating the comparison of kinase
  activity of AKT2 among three subtypes (one-way ANOVA). K Spearman-rank correlation
  of the abundance of AKT2 and GSVA score of cell cycle. L Scatter plot displaying
  the association between each phosphosites’ abundance with the global abundance of
  AKT2 (y axis) versus the global abundance of GRB7 (x axis). Cell cycle-associated
  phosphosites are labeled in pink. M The scatter plot indicating the cell lines with
  higher level of GRB7 protein expressions are more sensitive to ERBB2 inhibitor treatment
  (lower IC50) (Spearman’s correlation). N The bar plot indicating the frequency of
  pancreatic head (H-PDAC) and pancreatic body and tail (BT-PDAC) among three subtypes
  (Fisher’s exact test). O The heatmap indicating the GSVA scores of the pathway between
  H-PDAC and BT-PDAC in proteome and phosphoproteome levels. Each column represented
  a patient sample, color of each cell showed GSVA scores. P, Q The boxplot indicating
  the comparison of abundance of GRB7 (P) and MGPS (Q) score between H-PDAC and BT-PDAC
  (Student’s t test). R The heatmap indicating the cascading expression patterns of
  ERBB2, GRB7, and cell cycle related genes between tumor locations. The hazard ratios
  of these proteins are showed on the right. S Illustration of the regulatory role
  of GRB7 amplification. ****p < 1.0E−4, ***p < 1.0E−3, **p < 1.0E−2, *p < 0.05, ns > 0.05'
