caption: 'C3G enhanced promoter activity of CRE through the β2AR signaling pathway.
  HEK293 cells were transiently co-transfected with pGL4.29 and pcDNA3.1-β2AR then
  seeded into a 96-well plate. Transfected cells were treated with vehicle (0.1% DMSO,
  shown as −), isoproterenol (10 μM, shown as Iso), or C3G at the indicated concentrations
  for 24 h treatment. Luminescence value corresponding to CRE promoter activity was
  measured using cell lysates. Statistical analysis was conducted using one-way ANOVA
  (Tukey’s test). Significance differences (****p < 0.0001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05)
  versus vehicle treatment group at cells co-transfected with pGL4.29 and pcDNA3.1-β2AR.
  Significant differences (####p < 0.0001, ##p < 0.01) versus vehicle treatment group
  at cells transfected with pGL4.29. n = 5.'
