caption: Model of the role of KrasG12D in regulation of Tsc1 insufficiency-induced
  HCC tumorigenesis and metastasis. Under Tsc1 insufficiency conditions, mTOR is weakly
  activated and induces a long period of liver tumorigenesis. Under Kras mutant conditions,
  Kras activation initiates the Mek/Erk signaling pathway to generate high levels
  of ROS, which activate mTOR to induce a long period of liver tumorigenesis. Upon
  Tsc1 insufficiency and Kras mutant, Tsc1 insufficiency further promotes Kras-Mek-Erk-ROS-mediated
  mTOR activation, which upregulates PEG3 expression and promotes its interaction
  with STAT3. Activated STAT3 causes transcriptional activation of BEX2, leading to
  an accelerated liver tumorigenesis and lung metastasis with a shortened latent period
  and increased incidence. Targeting of mTOR (e.g., rapamycin and sapanisertib) could
  significantly inhibit HCC tumorigenesis and lung metastasis in HCC patients with
  Kras mutant and Tsc1 insufficiency.
