  enrichment
caption: '(A) Single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) enrichment scores
  of glioblastoma initiating cells (GICs) (N=2) for three different gene signatures;
  ACS (red), OPC Enriched-300 Signature (blue) and OPC Specific-300 Signature (teal),
  statistical significance tested using two-way ANOVA. Green dashed line indicating
  threshold for enrichment. (B) ssGSEA enrichment scores based on pseudo-bulk (aggregated
  within a patient) data of the cancer cell subset from the single-cell RNA sequencing
  (scRNAseq) glioblastoma tumour data from , and , for three different gene signatures,
  ACS (red), OPC Enriched-300 Signature (blue), and OPC Specific-300 Signature (teal).
  (C) Percentage of single cells for each tumour, which scored the highest for one
  of the three different signatures: ACS (red), OPC Enriched-300 Signature (blue),
  and OPC Specific-300 Signature (teal). Green dashed line indicating threshold for
  enrichment. (D) Scatter plot of the ACS enrichment score and the percentage of hypo-methylated
  DMRs for each of the GICs from our cohort, when comparing to iNSCs from our cohort.
  (E) Scatter plot of the ACS enrichment score and the percentage of hypo-methylated
  differentially methylated regions (DMRs) for each of the HGCC GICs, when comparing
  to induced neural stem cells (iNSCs) from our cohort. (F) Volcano plot of differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) identified from the comparison of BE-GICs versus nBE-GICs
  (glm model used for differentially expressed [DE] analysis). (G) Volcano plot of
  DEGs identified from the comparison of BE-GICs versus nBE-GICs from the HGCC cohort
  (glm model used for DE analysis). (H) Summary of pathway analysis performed using
  gProfiler, using the DEGs identified in (F) and (G). Figure 3â€”source data 1.Source
