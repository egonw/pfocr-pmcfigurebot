caption: 'Effect of KC-A on Abi sensitivity in C4-2 cells. (A) Cell viability. The
  cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of CRPC drugs, Abi, apalutamide
  (Apa) or darolutamide (Dar) for 72 h in the absence or presence of indicated concentrations
  of KC-A and the cell viability was measured with an Alamar blue assay. ** p < 0.01
  denotes significantly different from the cells treated with Abi alone. (B) Combined
  effects. Combination index (CI) values of the combination treatment were calculated
  by the CompuSyn software. CI < 1, CI = 1, and CI > 1 denotes synergism, additivity
  and antagonism effects, respectively. (C–F) The cells were treated without or with
  10 μM Abi for 24 h in the absence or presence of 5 μM KC-A. (C) Protein expression
  of AR and apoptosis-associated proteins. The expression of AR, total and cleaved
  PARP, Bax, Bcl-2 and β-actin in the cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting.
  The ratio of AR/β-actin, PARP/cleaved PARP or Bax/Bcl-2 is expressed as a percentage
  of that in the control cells treated with DMSO alone. ** p < 0.01, NS p > 0.05 compared
  with the control cells. ## p < 0.01 denotes significantly different from the cells
  treated with Abi alone. (D,E) Immunofluorescence staining. The cells were stained
  with DAPI (blue) and antibodies against AR (red, (D)), cleaved caspase-3 antibody
  (green, (E)). Merged images are also shown. Scale bar represents 20 μm. (F) MT-1
  staining. Mitochondrial membrane potential of the cells was determined with a fluorescence
  probe MT-1. The fluorescence intensity was quantified using ImageJ, and the signal
  intensity in the treated cells is expressed as the percentage of that in the control
  cells treated with vehicle DMSO alone * p < 0.05, NS p > 0.05 compared with the
  control cells. ## p < 0.01 denotes significantly different from the cells treated
  with Abi alone. Scale bar represents 20 μm.'
