caption: The expression of GALNT1 and VVA in patients with gastric cancer. A, The
  mRNA levels of GALNT1 in 13 paired gastric cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues
  (normalized to GAPDH). B, Western blot analysis depicting the GALNT1 levels in paired
  primary tumors and adjacent normal tissues. C, Representative immunohistochemical
  images of GALNT1 and VVA expression in samples and para-carcinoma tissues of patients
  with gastric cancer. D, Correlation analysis between GALNT1 and VVA immunohistochemistry
  score. E, Upregulated VVA expression in paired primary tumor tissues compared to
  adjacent normal tissues as examined by immunofluorescence assay. F-I, Kaplan-Meier
  analysis of overall survival and disease-free survival for patients with gastric
  cancer according to the immunohistochemistry of GALNT1 and VVA.
