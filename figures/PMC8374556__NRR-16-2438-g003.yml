caption: 'Diagram of ingenuity pathway analysis of signaling pathway proteins that
  are differentially expressed in the dexamethasone-treated and CCI model groups.Acute
  phase response signaling, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, LXR/RXR activation, FXR/RXR
  activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, atherosclerosis signaling, iron homeostasis
  signaling, the synaptogenesis signaling pathway, the glutamate receptor signaling
  pathway, and the Sertoli cell-Sertoli cell junction signaling pathway were the most
  significant enrichment pathways. CCI: Controlled cortical injury.'
