caption: IMP4 silencing inhibited proliferation, promoted apoptosis, and induced cell
  cycle arrest in LUAD cells. After treatment of A549 and H1299 cells with si-IMP4-1
  and si-IMP4-2, IMP4 levels were determined with qRT-PCR (a); proliferation was examined
  applying CKK-8 (b) and EdU analysis (c); apoptosis was detected using Annexin-V/PI
  double staining kit (d); the expression of Bcl-2, Bax, and PARP was measured using
  Western-blotting (e); cell cycle was evaluated applying cell cycle and apoptosis
  analysis kit (f). Protein levels of cyclin D1, P21, and P53 in A549 and H1299 cells
  (g). ∗P <  0.05, ∗∗P  <  0.01.
