caption: Highlighting the neuroprotective role of Substance P in Parkinson’s disease.
  SP upon interaction with NK1 receptor, decreases Ca2+ entry, caspase-3 stimulation,
  ROS formation, and modulates MtMP, which in turn inhibit programmed cell death and
  cytotoxicity, and thereby protects MES23.5 cells from MPP+-prompted neurotoxicity.
  Septide, an analog of SP, upon interaction with NK1 receptor culminates in the suppression
  of programmed cell death pathways and stimulation of PKB/Akt signaling pathway,
  thereby protects nerve cells against 6-OHDA-prompted neurotoxicity. Further, senktide,
  upon interaction with NK3 receptor, reinstated the temporal order memory in the
  6-OHDA-lesioned hemiparkinsonian rat model. In addition, the three NK1 receptor
  antagonists, namely NAT, L-733060, and LY303870, upon introduction, decrease cellular
  demise provoked by 6-OHDA subjection, upgrade motor operations, and decrease levodopa-precipitated
  dyskinesia. Finally, by virtue of these mechanisms, SP markedly contributes to neuroprotective
  action in PD. Subtraction symbol indicates inhibitory/suppressing action, while
  addition symbol indicates stimulatory action. SP, Substance P; NAT, N-acetyl-L-tryptophan;
  LY303870, lanepitant; NK, neurokinin; NK1, neurokinin 1; NK3, neurokinin 3; Ca2+,

  protein kinase B signaling pathway; 6-OHDA, 6-hydroxy DA; PD, Parkinson’s disease;
