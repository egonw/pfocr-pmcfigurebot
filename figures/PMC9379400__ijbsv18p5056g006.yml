caption: P2RY13 can aggravate DSS-induced colitis by STAT3. (A-K) Both fl/fl and STAT3△IEC
  mice (n = 5-7 per group) were treated with or without 2.5% DSS for 8 days and received
  PBS or ADP (100 mg/kg) daily by oral gavage from day 1 to day 7. Representative
  colon morphology and length are shown in (A) and are quantified in (E). Mouse body
  weight (B) and disease activity index (DAI) (C) were recorded daily. Representative
  images of histological analyses are shown in (D) and are quantified in (F). Representative
  images of AB-PAS (×200) and immunohistochemical (×200) of ZO-1 and MUC-2 are shown
  in (G). Western blotting was performed to measure the levels of STAT3, ZO-1, Occludin,
  Bcl-2 and Bax are shown in (H). The mRNA expression of cytokines was measured in
  mouse colon tissues are shown in (I). TUNEL (× 200) staining of colon tissue and
  Statistical analysis of TUNEL-positive cells are shown in (J). Electron micrograph
  images of colonic segments harvested from mice are shown in (K) upper Scale bar
  =1 µm. bottom Scale bar = 2 um. Data are mean ± SEM, *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p
  < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001.
