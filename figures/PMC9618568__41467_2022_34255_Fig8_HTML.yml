figure_title: Multimodal approach revealed epigenetic alterations in ADPKD cyst cells
caption: a Subclustering of CNT_PC on the UMAP plot of the snATAC-seq dataset with
  annotation by subtype (left) or disease condition (right). b Dot plot showing gene
  activity patterns of the genes enriched in each of CNT_PC subpopulations. The diameter
  of the dot corresponds to the proportion of cells with detected activity of indicated
  gene and the intensity of the dot corresponds to average gene activity relative
  to all CNT_PC nuclei. c UMAP plot showing enrichment of transcription factor binding
  motifs for NF-κB pathway; NFKB1 (left) and RELA (middle), or Hippo pathway; TEAD3
  (right). The color scale represents a normalized log-fold-change (LFC). d Representative
  immunofluorescence images of ROR1 (red) and GPRC5A (green) in the ADPKD kidneys
  (n = 3). Scale bar indicates 50 µm (left) or 10 µm (right). e Cis-coaccessibility
  network (CCAN, gray arcs) among accessible regions (red boxes) around the GPRC5A
  locus is shown. f Fragment coverage (frequency of Tn5 insertion) around TSS (middle
  right, chr12:12890233–12893174) or 5’ distal differentially accessible region (middle
  left, chr12:12871973–12873059) are shown (peak ±1 Kb). Bonferroni-adjusted p-values
  were used to determine significance for differential accessibility. g Graphic methodology
  showing CRISPR interference. Schematic was created with BioRender. h RT and real-time
  PCR analysis of mRNAs for GPRC5A or its surrounding genes (DDX47, HEBP1, and GPRC5D)
  in WT9-12 cells with CRISPR interference targeting the promoter (Prom) or 5’ distal
  potential enhancer (Enh) for GPRC5A gene. NT nontargeting control. Each group consists
  of n = 6 data (2 sgRNAs with 3 biological replicates). i UMAP plot showing enrichment
  of transcription factor binding motifs for CREB1 (left) or retinoic acid receptor
  (RARA::RXRG, right). The color scale represents a normalized LFC. j RT and real-time
  PCR analysis of mRNAs for GPRC5A in WT9-12 cells treated with forskolin (10 μM)
  with or without all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA, 1 μM) for 6 h (n = 3 biological replicates).
  Bar graphs represent the mean and error bars are the s.d. One-way ANOVA with post
  hoc Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test. Source data are provided as a Source Data
  file (h, j).
