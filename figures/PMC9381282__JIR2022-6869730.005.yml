caption: 'rhALR alleviates inflammation in H/R-induced HK2 cells. (a, b) Real-time
  PCR and ELISA analysis showed that the mRNA and protein expressions of IL-1β, IL-6,
  and TNF-α were upregulated after H/R induced reoxygenation for 12 h in HK2 cells.
  No above changes were observed in the H/R+rhALR group and the negative control group.
  And exogenous anti-rhALR Ab evidently blocked the anti-inflammatory effect of rhALR.
  All data obtained were expressed as the mean ± SD. ∗P < 0.05 vs. negative control,
  #P < 0.05 vs. H/R.'
