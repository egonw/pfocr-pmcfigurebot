caption: Effects of SFN treatment on the expression of LC3 expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
  (A, B) Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were treated with SFN (100 μM), 500 nM rapamycin,
  or 0.1% DMSO (Control) for 10 d. Cells were then fixed, stained with oil red-O staining,
  and analyzed with a BZ-9000 fluorescence microscope. Lipid accumulation was quantified
  using the ImageJ imaging software program. Scale bar=50 μm. Values are the mean±S.E.M.
  (n=9). *P<.001 versus Control (one-way ANOVA with a Student-Newman post hoc test).
  (C, D) Western blotting of LC3 and p62 in the 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Differentiated
  3T3-L1 cells were treated with 10 μM SFN or 0.1% DMSO (Control) for the indicated
  periods (0, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, and 9 h). β-actin was used as an internal control. Values
  are the mean±S.E.M. (n=3). *P<.05 versus 0 h (one-way ANOVA with a Student-Newman
  post hoc test). (E, F) After differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were treated with 10 μM
  SFN or 0.1% DMSO (Control) for 3 h, cells were fixed and stained for LC3 Ab conjugated
  to Alexa Fluor 568 (red). LDs were stained with BODIPY (493/503). Images were taken
  with a confocal laser-scanning microscope. Percentage colocalization of LC3 with
  BODIPY. Scale bar=10 μm. Values are the mean±S.E.M. (n=3). *P<.05 (two-tailed unpaired
  Student’s t test).
