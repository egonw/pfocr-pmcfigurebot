figure_title: TGFb, HH, and Wnt pathway activities determine the balance between the
  GPR56+CD34+ and GPR56+CD34− LSC compartments
caption: 'RNA‐seq after GPR56 KD in CD34+ CB cells reveals that GPR56 enhances gene
  expression displayed as reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM) of MYC,
  TNKS2, TGFB1, and SRC (top). Previously published RNA‐seq of ten sorted CD34+GPR56+
  versus CD34−GPR56+ fractions (Garg et al, ) shows a divergent expression pattern:
  downregulation of Wnt targets MYC and TNKS, but upregulation of TGFB1 and SRC in
  the CD34+GPR56+ fraction. Unpaired t‐test, bars, and error bars represent mean and
  SD of three biological replicates, ***P < 0.0005, **P < 0.005, *P < 0.05.Cartoon
  visualizing that GPR56 enhances genes and pathways differentially active in the
  CD34+GPR56+ fraction, which is characterized by slow cell cycle progression, high
  LSC frequency, and high expression of the stemness gene HLF versus the CD34−GPR56+
  cells, which are more differentiated (lower LSC frequency), cycle faster, and have
  little HLF expression. Arrows and blocked arrows indicate activation or inhibition
  by the indicated small molecules, respectively, which were used in subsequent experiments.Contour

  after 5‐day culture of purified CD34+GPR56+ cells from AML sample E218974 with CHIR99021
  or vehicle DMSO, Unpaired t‐test, bars, and error bars represent mean and SD of
  three technical replicates, ***P < 0.0005. Left: FACS profile and sorting strategy
  for the CD34‐GPR56+ fraction (top), and post‐sort purity (bottom) of AML sample
  E2112376 on the day of thawing. Right: CD34 and GPR56 expression measured by flow
  cytometry 5 days post exposure of purified CD34‐GPR56+cells to the indicated molecules
  or their combinations. PRI: PRI‐724, arrows indicate whether the pathway is inhibited
  (↓) or activated (↑) by the compound. Left: Bar graph showing the distribution of
  CD34 and GPR56 fractions at the end of the 5‐day culture of purified CD34−GPR56+
  cells from AML E2112376 with indicated compounds. Right: statistical analysis shown
  only for the CD34+GPR56+ fraction. See Dataset  for full statistical analysis. PRI:
  PRI‐724, Unpaired t‐test, bars, and error bars represent mean and SD of three individual
  treatments, ***P < 0.0005, **P < 0.005, *P < 0.05.Cartoon visualizing the proposed
  mechanism by which both GPR56+ LSC‐enriched compartments are maintained: GPR56 enhances
  pathways, which reciprocally inhibit each other and are differentially active in
  the two fractions. This should result in a constant transition between the compartments
  and thus prevent exhaustion of the two populations.'
