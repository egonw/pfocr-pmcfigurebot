caption: The immunopathogenic model of multiple sclerosis (MS) posits that a confluence
  of genetic and environmental variables, including viral infections, bacterial exposure,
  and superantigens, synergistically contribute to the heightened activation of myelin-reactive
  T cells within the circulatory system of individuals afflicted with MS. This phenomenon
  is further exacerbated by the elevated expression of endothelial adhesion molecules,
  namely intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1
  (VCAM-1), which facilitate the translocation of T cells into the central nervous
  system (CNS). The motility of these T cells is augmented by chemokines and the synthesis
  of matrix metalloproteinases, which enzymatically degrade extracellular matrix proteins
  to smooth the migration pathway. This collectively culminates in the T cells’ successful
  transgression of the blood–brain barrier (BBB). Upon entry into the CNS, T cells
  become activated via interactions with antigen-presenting cells, initiating the
  release of pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic mediators. These substances inflict tissue
  damage and compromise the integrity of the myelin sheath through several mechanisms,
  including cytokine-mediated injury, antibody-mediated phagocytosis of myelin antigens
  by macrophages, complement system activation, and direct cellular damage mediated
  by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Regulatory changes at the transcriptional level, instigated
  by cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 (IL-1),
  lead to the upregulation of VCAM-1 in endothelial cells. Notably, the integrin very
  late antigen-4 (VLA-4) does not bind to its designated ligands, including VCAM-1
  and fibronectin, unless activated by chemotactic agents or additional stimuli, often
  synthesized by endothelial cells or other cellular entities at the site of inflammation.
  One such activating chemokine is stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1). ICAM-1,
  a type of intercellular adhesion molecule, is constitutively present in nominal
  concentrations on leukocytes and endothelial cells. In response to cytokine stimulation,
  however, these concentrations markedly escalate. ICAM-1 serves as a ligand for lymphocyte
  function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), an integrin present in leukocytes. LFA-1
  plays a pivotal role in leukocyte emigration, facilitating their egress from the
  bloodstream and entry into tissues. Moreover, LFA-1 partakes in the processes of
  cytotoxic T-cell-mediated and antibody-mediated cellular destruction, enacted by
  granulocytes and monocytes. The mechanism governing T-lymphocyte infiltration into
  the CNS is explicable via the elevated expression of adhesion molecules on the endothelial
  cells constituting the BBB in MS cases. This assertion is further substantiated
  by the observation of these molecules on inflammatory cells such as macrophages
  and lymphocytes in MS lesions. It is a widely accepted notion that cytokines released
  by Th1 cells, including interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and TNF-beta (TNF-β), are capable
  of macrophage activation, subsequently causing damage to oligodendrocytes and leading
  to pathologic alterations in myelination.
