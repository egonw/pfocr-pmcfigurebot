figure_title: Association between PD-1+CD8+ T cell abundance and targetable genomic
  alterations in patients with Stage III gastric cancer
caption: 'a Heatmap demonstrated the genomic alterations of potential therapeutic
  targets in GC based on PD-1+CD8+ T cell signature level. b Quantification analyses
  of therapy-associated signal pathway signature between PD-1+CD8+ T cell signature
  low/high-expression subgroup among Stage III GC patients in ACRG cohort: TGFB signalling
  pathway (P < 0.001), VEGF/VEGFR signalling network (P < 0.001), ERBB signalling
  pathway (P < 0.05), MUC17 relative mRNA expression (P < 0.001), HRR signalling pathway
  (P < 0.010); HRR, homologous recombination repair. Data were analysed by Mann–Whitney
  U test. Small horizontal lines indicate the mean (±SD). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001,
  ns refers to not significant. P values presented here were two-tailed.'
