caption: 'FVS alleviated ovarian apoptosis via the Bax/Bcl-2 and caspase3 pathway.
  (A) Effects of FVS on the relative expression of apoptosis-related genes in the
  ovary tissues. (B and C) Effects of FVS on the protein levels of Bax, Bcl-2 and
  caspase3 in the ovary. Abbreviations: CON, laying hens fed with a basic diet; 2%FVS,
  laying hens fed with a basic diet supplemented with 20 g/kg FVS; 4%FVS, laying hens
  fed with a basic diet supplemented with 40 g/kg FVS; 6%FVS, laying hens fed with
  a basic diet supplemented with 60 g/kg FVS. The results are expressed as the mean
  ± SEM (n = 4); *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01.'
