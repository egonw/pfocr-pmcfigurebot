caption: 'Analysis of apoptosis and DNA damage mechanisms in response to genotoxic
  stress agents. (A) Control and myrAkt1 cells (2 × 105), seeded into 60 mm dishes,
  were left 24 h in GM and then exposed to increasing IR doses. Quantification of
  colony formation by a crystal violet assay was expressed as a natural logarithm,
  setting control to 1 (n = 3). Data are mean ± SEM, *** p-value < 0.0001; one-way
  Anova test. (B) Neutral red assay was performed to measure cell viability in control
  and myrAkt1 clones treated for 48 h with increasing doxorubicin doses (n = 3). Data
  are mean ± SEM, ** p-value < 0.001; one-way Anova test. (C) Cells (1 × 105) were
  seeded into 6-multiwell plates. After 24 h, cells were treated with 1 µM doxorubicin
  or DMSO vehicle. After 48 h, cells were stained with PI and Annexin V. The percentages
  of viable, early, and late apoptotic cells were calculated by FACS analysis and
  are reported in the graph (n = 2). (D) Clonogenic and neutral red assays (left and
  right graphs, respectively) were performed to measure viability of cells preincubated
  for 2 h with 10 µM LY294002, 10 µM MK2206, 100 nM rapamycin, or the DMSO vehicle
  before irradiation (4 Gy) and doxorubicin treatment (1 µM) (n = 3). Data are mean ±
  SEM, *** p-value < 0.0001; unpaired Student’s t-test vs. control RD cells. ## p-value
  < 0.001; ### p-value < 0.0001; one-way Anova test vs. DMSO-treated cells. (E) Control
  and myrAkt1 cells (1.5 × 105), seeded onto coverslips in 60 mm dishes, were left
  to proliferate in GM for 48 h before irradiation (4 Gy) or treatment with doxorubicin
  (1 µM). Nuclear γH2AX staining was evaluated by IF analysis over a time course of
  24 h. Representative images were taken at 63× magnification. The reported quantification
  in the bottom left graphs is relative to the average number of γH2AX-positive cells
  counted in 10 different fields (n = 2). As reported in the bottom right graphs,
  nuclear γH2AX staining was evaluated in cells pre-treated with 10 μM LY294002, 10
  μM MK2206, 100 nM rapamycin, or the DMSO vehicle for 2 h before irradiation (4 Gy)
  or administration of doxorubicin (1 µM) (n = 2). Data are mean ± SEM, * p-value
  < 0.05; *** p-value < 0.0001; unpaired Student’s t-test. (F) Control and myrAkt1
  cells (1.5 × 105), seeded into 60 mm dishes, were left to proliferate in GM for
  48 h before irradiation (4 Gy) (top panel) or treatment with doxorubicin (1 µM)
  (bottom panel). At the indicated time points, cells were harvested, and protein
  homogenates were blotted to perform IB for pDNA-PK (n = 2). Under the same conditions
  seen above, cells were pre-treated with 10 μM LY294002, 10 μM MK2206, 100 nM rapamycin,
  or the DMSO vehicle for 2 h prior to irradiation (4 Gy) (left panel) or doxorubicin
  administration (1 µM) (right panel). IB was performed using protein homogenates
  from cells harvested after 8 h (n = 2). Data are mean ± SEM, ** p-value < 0.001;
  *** p-value < 0.0001; unpaired Student’s t-test.'
