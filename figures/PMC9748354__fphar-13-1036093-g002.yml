caption: 'Mechanisms of action of Fluoxetine for COVID-19 (from left to right): FLX
  can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells through the endocytic pathway by inducing
  accumulation of cholesterol within the endosomes, leading to inactivation of the
  endolysosomal proton pump manage pH maintenance and so leading to impairment of
  endolysosomal acidification. The inhibitory effect of FLX on ASMase activity results
  in sphingomyelin accumulation, providing a barrier against virus entry. FLX suppress
  the cytokine storm by interfering with NF-kappaB/IL6ST axis. FLX is also found to
  decrease the protease-1 expression on mast cells and histamine release, hence the
  decreased cytokine storm. the S1R activation induced by FLX mediates the inhibition
  of IRE1 and related inflammatory response.'
