caption: 'Expression measurement by qPCR of different EMT biomarkers with TGF-β stimulation
  at (A) 0, 24, 48, and 72 h in HeLa. (B) Correlation plot between the expression
  of three EMT markers in the HeLa proteomic analysis and the HeLa qPCR assay. The
  expression is represented based on the log2 FC and the R coefficient using Pearson’s
  method. (C) Expression measurement of EMT markers by qPCR in BJ-5ta after 0, 24
  and 48 h of stimulation with TGF-β1 ligand (D) Comparative heatmap with Z-score
  values per sample of EMT markers in HeLa and BJ-5ta after 24 h of TGF-β1 stimulation.
  These experiments were performed by triplicate (n = 3). *: adj. p-value < 0.05,
  **: adj. p-value < 0.01.'
