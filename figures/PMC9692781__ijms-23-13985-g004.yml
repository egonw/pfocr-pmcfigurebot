caption: Bidirectional TE-NSPs with Surrogate Striatal Neuron End Targets. Representative
  confocal reconstructions of TE-NSPs at 14 DIV labeled via immunocytochemistry to
  denote dopaminergic neurons/axons (TH, green), striatal medium spiny neurons (DARPP-32,
  red), and synapses (synapsin, purple), with nuclear counterstain (Hoechst, blue).
  (a) An enriched TE-NSP (dopaminergic neurons on the left side) plated with an aggregated
  striatal end target (located on the right side). (b) Higher-magnification reconstructions
  from a demonstrative region in (a) depicting dense dopaminergic neurite outgrowth
  and containing a high degree of synapsin labeling (purple) within the striatal aggregate.
  (c) A striatal aggregate end target within a bidirectional, enriched TE-NSP. (d)
  Higher-magnification reconstructions from a demonstrative region in (c) depict synapsin+
  puncta (purple) decorating putative dendrites projecting from striatal neurons (red)
  shown with dopaminergic axonal varicosities (green). Scale bar (a) = 250 µm. Scale
  bar (b) = 20 µm. Scale bar (c) = 50 µm. Scale bar (d) = 25 µm.
