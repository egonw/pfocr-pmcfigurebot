caption: LETM2 may activate the downstream PI3K-Akt signaling pathway by increasing
  the phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt. (A) KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were performed
  on LETM2 and co-expressed genes in PDAC. (B) The molecular functions (MF) of GO
  functional enrichment analyses were performed on LETM2 and co-expressed genes in
  PDAC. (C) The biological processes (BP) of GO functional enrichment analyses were
  performed on LETM2 and co-expressed genes in PDAC. (D) The cellular components (CC)
  of GO functional enrichment analyses were performed on LETM2 and co-expressed genes
  in PDAC. (E) Western blotting analysis for evaluating the key protein level of PI3K-Akt
  signaling pathway after LETM2 knockdown. The densitometry readings/intensity ratio
  of each band and the original whole blot could be found in . (F) Quantitation of
  Western blotting implied that p-PI3K and p-Akt were significantly inhibited after
  LETM2 knockdown. Studentâ€™s t-test was performed. ns, not significant; ** p < 0.01.
