  enrichment analyses of target genes of differential tRNA-derived small (tsRNAs).
  (A) Venn diagram of signaling pathways of differentially expressed tsRNAs in intrauterine
  growth restriction (IUGR) and normal-size pigs annotated against different GO and
  KEGG entries. (B,C) KEGG analysis of differentially expressed tsRNAs target genes,
  together with (B) significantly enriched signaling pathways and (C) individually
  significantly enriched signaling pathways.
