caption: 'CHI3L1 expression is correlated with the malignancy and OS of glioma. (A-B)
  The mRNA levels of CHI3L1 in 33 cancer types and paired normal tissues in TCGA.
  (C-E) CHI3L1 expression levels in normal and glioma tissues in GEO, TCGA and CGGA.
  (F-H) CHI3L1 expression levels in staged gliomas in GEO, TCGA and CGGA. (G) CGGA
  mRNA_array_301, (H) CGGA mRNAseq_325. (I) Serum levels of CHI3L1 in patients with
  glioma. (J) Representative pictures of H&E staining and IHC analysis of CHI3L1 expression
  levels in glioma and paired normal tissues; Scale bars represent 100 µm. (K-L) Western
  blot and quantitative analysis of CHI3L1 expression in seven pairs of glioma with
  different grades and paired normal tissues. (M-N) Western blot and quantitative
  analysis of CHI3L1 expression in normal tissues and staged gliomas. (O-P) ROC curve
  exhibited the sensitivity and specificity of CHI3L1 to predict glioma in TCGA and
  CGGA databases. (O) 5 y (AUC = 0.819), 3 y (AUC = 0.881), 1 y (AUC = 0.852). (P)
  5 y (AUC = 0.784), 3 y (AUC = 0.782), 1 y (AUC = 0.741), y: year. TPR: true positive
  rate. FPR: False positive rate. (Q-S) Survival benefits between CHI3L1high and CHI3L1low
  groups (median was the cut-off to identify high and low groups) were assessed via
  Kaplan-Meier analysis using both the Log-rank and Wilcoxon-Breslow tests. (Q) Log-rank
  p = 0, HR (high) = 6.4, p (HR) = 0, n (high) = 338, n (low) = 337. (R) Log-rank
  p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon p < 0.0001. (S) Log-rank p = 0.0692, Wilcoxon p = 0.0243. (T)
  The mRNA expression profile of CHI3L1 in glioma cell lines from the CCLE. (U-V)
  Comparison of CHI3L1 expression levels in glioma cell lines analyzed by one-way
  analysis of variance (ANOVA). N: normal. G: glioma. T: tumors. OS: overall survival.
  PFS: progression-free survival. M: months. Student''s t test, *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01;
  ****p < 0.0001.'
