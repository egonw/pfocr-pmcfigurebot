caption: 'Protein expression changes in apoptosis and proliferation and the AKT-mTOR
  pathway. A-D: Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression of apoptosis
  and proliferation and the AKT-mTOR pathway in BGC-823 and MGC-803 cells after silencing
  lncRNA AC022424.2; E: Changes in the expression of lncRNA AC022424.2 in cancer tissue
  and adjacent tissue samples from clinical patients were analyzed using quantitative
  reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The results were obtained from
  three independent tests. aP < 0.05, bP < 0.01, cP < 0.001.'
