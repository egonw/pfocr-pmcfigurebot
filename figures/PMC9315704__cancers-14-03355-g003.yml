caption: Effect of citrate treatment on HIF1α expression. (A) Heat-map representing
  color-coded expression levels of differentially expressed genes (p > 0.05, normalized
  data(log2) > 4, up- or downregulated > 1.5-fold) in HepG2 cells after treatment
  with or without citrate treatment under 1% O2 for 24 h. (B) Top 12 significantly
  enriched pathways of differentially expressed genes associated with citrate treatment
  under hypoxic conditions as analyzed by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
  pathway analysis. (C) Heat-map of dysregulated genes related to glycolysis, TCA
  cycle, and fatty acid biosynthesis after treatment with the same as (A). (D) PTEN,
  phosphor (p) AKT (S473), AKT, MDM2, pMDM2 (S166), SIRT1, and β-actin expression
  levels in HepG2 cells after incubation with citrate (0, 1, or 5 mM) under 21% or
  1% O2 for 24 h. (E) HIF1α, MDM2, and β-actin expression levels in HCC cells after
  transfection with siRNA oligos against MDM2 (siMDM2) or scrambled siRNA oligos for
  24 h incubation upon indicated condition. (F) HIF1α and β-actin expression levels
  in HepG2 cells after treatment with citrate and MG-132 under 21% or 1% O2 for 8
  h. Full Western Blot images can be found in .
