caption: Overexpression of HOXA10 suppressed cell apoptosis in EC cells. (a) The siHOXA10
  increased apoptosis rate of Eca-109 and TE-1 cells and overexpression of HOXA10
  increased apoptosis rate. Annexin V-FITC assay was used to measure cell apoptosis.
  (b) The apoptosis-related proteins containing Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3, and
  cleaved caspase-9 were determined by western blot Eca-109 and TE-1 cells. (c) The
  cleaved PARP and PARP protein levels were assessed by western blot. Each experiment
  repeated three times. *p  <  0.05, **p  <  0.01, ***p  < 0 .001 vs NC. @p < 0.05,
  @@p < 0.01, @@@p < 0.001 vs siNC.
