caption: The carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in tomato (A) and chromosomal distribution
  of the 25 carotenoid biosynthesis pathway genes in tomato (B). The key carotenoid
  biosynthesis pathway genes (i.e. nine upstream genes (Red), seven downstream genes
  (blue) and two silenced or minimally expressed downstream genes (green)) affecting
  the fruit lycopene content in the red ripe fruits of the 42 potential HLYs were
  indicated. The 12 tomato chromosomes were labeled as 1 ~ 12 on the top of each chromosome.
  Red, significantly higher relative expression levels for nine upstream genes in
  comparison to Moneymaker; blue, significantly higher relative expression levels
  for seven downstream genes in comparison to the wild tomato S. pimpinellifolium
  L. (LA2093); green, insignificant difference in relative expression of four pathway
  genes in comparison to the non-functional crtiso in NC 1Y. Relative expression levels
  of each pathway gene were measured individually by qPCR with Expressed and CAC being
  the reference genes. Comparison was made to the low-lycopene control Moneymaker
  (for the upstream genes) or the positive control wild tomato (for the downstream
  genes). Statistics were conducted using two-tailed student’s t-test with two-sample
  unequal variance, i.e. significantly different expression from that in controls.
  B, breaker stage; R, red ripe stage.
