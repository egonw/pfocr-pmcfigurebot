caption: Schematic model depicting symbiotic gene involvements in A. evenia. Mutant-based
  identified genes are in bold, other genes are inferred from model legumes. The symbiotic
  signaling pathway and the recently identified gene AeCRK are required for Nod-independent
  signaling and intercellular infection. AePOLLUX, AeCCaMK, and AeCYCLOPS are also
  important for arbuscular mycorrhization. AeNSP2 has as an additional nonsymbiotic
  function to regulate nitrogen-dependent responses including axillary root hair formation.
  ‘?’ represents how AeCRK connects to the symbiotic signaling pathway remains to
  be determined. This representation is adapted from .
