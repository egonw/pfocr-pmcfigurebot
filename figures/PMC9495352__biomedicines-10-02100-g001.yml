caption: The ubiquitinâ€“proteasome system (UPS) and proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC).
  For the degradation of a protein through UPS, the ubiquitin (Ub) is linked to an
  Ub-activating enzyme (E1) via a thioester bond in the ATP-dependent reaction. Next,
  activated Ub on E1 is transferred to an Ub-conjugating enzyme (E2) through trans-thioesterification.
  The Ub-ligase (E3) recognizes a degradation signal (degron) of an endogenous substrate
  and conjugates a Ub from E2 to a lysine residue of the substrate protein. The serial
  cascades of Ub-activation, Ub-conjugation, and Ub-ligation by E1, E2, and E3 polyubiquitylate
  the substrate or substrate-conjugated Ub. The 26S proteasome recognizes the polyubiquitin
  chains on the substrate, subsequently followed by deubiquitylation, unfolding, and
  degradation of the substrate. The PROTAC can hijack the E3 by its ligand and recruit
  a target protein for degradation through UPS (adapted from [,]).
