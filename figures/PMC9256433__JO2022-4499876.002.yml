caption: 'EVs secreted by high-metastatic cervical cancer cells carrying miR-146a-5p
  can promote the malignancy of low-metastatic cervical cancer cells. (a) Transmission
  electron microscopy for identification of the EVs isolated from cervical cancer
  cell line (CaSki) and normal cervical epithelial cell line (HcerEpic). (b) Dynamic
  light scattering detection of the diameter of EVs isolated from cervical cancer
  cell line (CaSki) and normal cervical epithelial cell line (HcerEpic). (c) Western
  blot assay of the expression of EV surface markers (CD81, CD63, and TSG101) and
  endoplasmic reticulum marker protein Calnexin. (d) RT-qPCR determination of the
  expression of miR-146a-5p in EVs secreted by cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa, CaSki,
  SiHa, and C33A) and normal cervical epithelial cells (End1/E6E7 and HcerEpic). (e)
  The uptake of CaSki cells-secreted EVs by C33A cells observed under an inverted
  fluorescence microscope, scale bar: 25 μm. (f) C33A cells transfected with pCDNA3.1-GFP
  after co-culture with CaSki cells transfected with miR-146a-5p-Cy3 observed using
  an inverted fluorescence microscope, scale bar: 25 μm. (g) RT-qPCR determination
  of the expression of miR-146a-5p in EVs secreted by different groups of CaSki cells.
  (h) RT-qPCR determination of the expression of miR-146a-5p in C33A cells after treatment
  with EV-miR-146a-5p-mimic. (i) Transwell assay of invasion and migration of C33A
  cells after treatment with the equal number of EVs from miR-146a-5p-mimic-transfected
  CaSki cells. (j) The adhesion of C33A cells to the extracellular matrix after treatment
  with EV-miR-146a-5p-mimic. (k) TUNEL staining of the apoptosis of C33A cells after
  treatment with EV-miR-146a-5p-mimic. (l) Western blot assay of the protein expression
  of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and Vimentin in C33A cells after treatment with EV-miR-146a-5p-mimic.
  The data in the Figure were measurement data and expressed as mean ± standard deviation.
  The data between two groups were analyzed by unpaired t-test, and the comparison
  among multiple groups was performed by a one-way analysis of variance (Dunnett''s
  post hoc test). ∗p < 0.05. Cell experiments were repeated 3 times independently.'
