caption: 'Change in body weight during drug treatments and survival. All animals except
  naïve controls received bleomycin treatment from day 1–28 and test agents beginning
  24 h before the first bleomycin treatment until day 42 (A) Stress on the animals
  was observed in the rapid weight loss during the first week in the nintedanib and
  prednisolone groups, and a lack of significant weight gain over the 6 weeks study
  in all groups except 100 mg/kg CCG‐257081. (B) Survival curves highlight the increased
  mortality rate in the group receiving prednisolone. Due to excessive weight loss
  and animal loss, the dose of prednisolone was lowered from 15 to 5 mg/kg. In all
  other groups, loss of animals is believed due to complications with the daily oral
  gavage of drug. Weight change time courses, which are significantly different from
  the vehicle control, are marked (*p < .05, **p < .01). Groups: naïve control (n = 6),
  bleomycin + vehicle (n = 10), 10 mg/kg CCG‐257081 (n = 15), 30 mg/kg CCG‐257081
  (n = 15), 100 mg/kg CCG‐257081 (n = 10), 30 mg/kg nintedanib (n = 10), and prednisolone
  (15 mg/kg Days 1–7, 5 mg/kg Days 8–42, n = 10)'
