caption: 'The percentage of cell viability of (A) DBTRG-05MG, (B) SVGp12 treated with
  andrographolide, (C) DBTRG-05MG treated with temozolomide in a time frame of 24,
  48, and 72 h. The results were analyzed in GraphPad Prism 8.0.1 (Graphpad software,
  Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Data expressed as mean Â± SEM and statistical analysis
  between three independent groups was performed by t-test compared with the untreated
  group: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.005, *** p < 0.0005.'
