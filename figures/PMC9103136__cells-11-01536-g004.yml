caption: Impaired glycogenolysis in Ndrg3 LKO livers due to dysregulation of genes
  in glycogen degradation pathway. (A) Quantitative measurement of hepatic glycogen
  volumes depending on feeding conditions in 2- and 4-month-old wild-type and Ndrg3
  LKO mice (n = 3–5 per group). Mice were fasted for 15 h or refed for additional
  6 h before being subject to the glycogen analysis. (B) Schematic depiction of representative
  genes and pathways involved in the mobilization and/or storage of glucose in liver.
  Genes whose deficiency is implicated in the manifestation of glycogen storage disease
  phenotypes in humans are shown. (C) qRT-PCR analysis of the expression of glycogen
  metabolism pathway genes in the livers of wild-type and Ndrg3 LKO mice at 2 months
  of age. Mice were fasted for 15 h or refed for additional 6 h before being subject
  to the gene expression analysis (n = 4–5 per group). (D) PYGL protein expression
  in primary hepatocytes isolated from 3-month-old wild-type and Ndrg3 LKO mice. (E)
  Expression of PYGL and p-PYGL(S15) in wild-type and Ndrg3 LKO mouse livers at the
  age of 2 months (n = 5 per group) or 4 months (n = 4 per group). Mice were fasted
  for 15 h or refed for additional 6 h before being subject to the Western blot analysis.
  Total PYGL and p-PYGL(S15) were quantified from immunoblots shown in  using ImageJ
  program. (F) PYGL activity measured from the livers of 4-month-old wild-type and
  Ndrg3 LKO mice (n = 5 per group). Mice were fasted for 15 h and then refed for 6
  h before being subject to PYGL activity assay. Gene expression was normalized using
  Gapdh as the reference. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. p-values were calculated
  using two-tailed Student’s t-test (F), or two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s correction
  for multi-comparison (A,C,E). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 vs. wild
  mice.
