caption: Corpus callosum astrocyte-specific genes and pathways(A) Overlap analysis
  showing the CC astrocyte-specific differentially expressed, enriched and de-enriched
  genes (adjusted p value < 0.05).(B) Top 50 genes that were enriched and de-enriched
  in CC astrocytes, based on rank from largest to lowest log2 fold change value (absolute
  value, log2 FC > 0 enriched, log2 FC < 0 de-enriched) derived from the comparison
  of CC vs ONP.(C) Over-representation analysis of enriched and de-enriched genes
  using the Reactome database showing enriched pathways unique for CC astrocytes.
  Listed are all pathways with adjusted p value < 0.05, restricted to the top 46 most
  significant de-enriched pathways (see  for complete results). Each pathway is color
  matched for the broader category it belongs to.(D–F) In red are key enzymes enriched
  in our dataset for the (D) glycogen synthesis and breakdown pathway, (E) glycolysis
  pathway, and (F) the TCA cycle including glutaminolysis.
