figure_title: Unique clusters of tjTS>lglRNAi dataset exhibit distinct gene expression
  and regulon activity
caption: '(A) Left: UMAP plot of the re-embedded tjTS>lglRNAi follicle cells with
  the unique clusters being highlighted. Right: RNA velocity vectors superimposed
  on the embedded cells of unique tjTS>lglRNAi clusters revealing the inferred lineage.
  (B) Left: cells are colored according to their arrangement on the velocity-inferred
  pseudotime from early (purple) to late (yellow). Right: cells are colored to denote
  terminal states of differentiation according to their position on the inferred lineage,
  where stable end points are colored in red and root cells are colored in blue. Observed
  noncompliance of inferred lineage and terminal states likely represents mixed population
  of cells. (C) Heatmap of the top 20 cluster-specific markers (if present) in the
  72h-tjTS>lglRNAi dataset. Selected genes are expressed in a minimum of 75% cells
  per cluster. Range of gene expression is scaled within +2 (red) to –2 (blue) log2
  fold change. (D) Confocal images showing Drpr (left) in green and Sn staining (right)
  in red. Sn+ polar cells are indicated by arrowheads, while oocyte is indicated by
  asterisks (*). Dcp-1 (red) is also shown in left panel to identify dying germline
  cells within degenerating egg chambers. Nucleus is marked by DAPI (white). Scale
  bars: 20 µm. (E) Heatmap of the scaled (and centered) activity scores of regulons
  in clusters 7, 8, and 13. Both columns (clusters) and rows (regulons) are clustered
  hierarchically and relative similarity between cluster 7 and cluster 8 regulon activity
  is inferred. (F) Regulon specificity score (RSS) rank plots show the specificity
  of regulon activity for clusters 7, 8, and 13. (G) Bar plot shows the relative mRNA
  levels of JNK signaling pathway components Ets21C, grnd, Jra, kay, and Mmp1 in tjTS
  control (N = 12 pairs of ovaries) and tjTS>lglRNAi sample (N = 15) using quantitative
  RT-PCR. Bars representing the tjTS experimental control are colored salmon while
  tjTS>lglRNAi is colored purple. Error bars represent Standard Error (SE) and the
  p-values obtained for individual t-test comparisons between samples are listed above
  each pairing. (H) Gene enrichment of Ets21C (red), Jra, kay, and grnd (green) is
  shown on the UMAP-embedded cells. Overlapping expression is colored in yellow. Figure
