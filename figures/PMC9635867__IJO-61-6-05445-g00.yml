caption: Major roles of different m6A regulators in the occurrence and development
  of EC. (A) m6A methylation regulators METTL3/14, WTAP, FTO, ALKBH5, YTHDF1/2 and
  IGF2BP1 promote or inhibit the proliferation, invasion, metastasis and self-renewal
  of EC by regulating the m6A-related pathway. (B) m6A methylation regulator YTHDF2
  promotes the proliferation of EC by downregulating the expression of lncRNA-FENDRR.
  EC, endometrial cancer; METTL3/14, methyltransferase-like 3/14; mTORC2, mammalian
  target of rapamycin complex 2; PHLPP2, pleckstrin homology domain and leucine-rich
  repeat protein phosphatase 2; WTAP, Wilms' tumor 1-associated protein; CAV1, caveolin-1;
  FTO, fat mass and obesity-associated protein; ALKBH5, AlkB homolog 5; HOXB13, homeobox
  B13; MMP-2/9, matrix metalloproteinases-2/9; IGF1R, insulin-like growth factor 1
  receptor; COL1A1, collagen type I alpha 1; SOX2, sex-determining region Y-box 2;
  YTHDF1/2, YT521-B homology domain family 1/2; IRS1, insulin receptor substrate 1;
  IGF2BP1, IGF2 mRNA-binding protein 1; PEG10, paternally expressed gene 10; lncRNA,
  long non-coding RNA; SOX4, SRY-related HMG box transcription factor 4; m6A, N6-methyladenosine.
