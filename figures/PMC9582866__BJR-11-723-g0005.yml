caption: 'Differentiation of primary chondrocytes in depleted and overexpressed p67phox.
  a) Later passage of chondrocytes were transiently transfected with various doses
  of p67phox (pcDNA- p67phox) or control (pcDNA3.1) plasmid for additional 24 hours,
  to detect the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression of chondrogenic and differentiation
  marker as indicated by using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
  or western blot. b) Early stage of chondrocytes were transfected with specific shRNA
  of p67phox (pLKO.1-p67phox-shRNA) or a luciferase control (pLKO.1-shLuc) to measure
  mRNA and protein expression of chondrogenic and differentiation marker as indicated
  by using RT-PCR or western blot. The expression of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (Gapdh) or β-ACTIN was used as an internal control of RT-PCR or western blot, respectively.
  c) Late passage of primary chondrocytes were treated as in , and senescence-associated
  β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity and Alcian Blue staining (left panel) were used
  to detect these. Representative photomicrograph of the SA-β-gal assay is shown.
  The percentage of β-galactosidase-positive cells in each group was compared and
  is illustrated in the histogram; n = 3 in each experiment. d) Early passage of chondrocyte
  were treated as in , and senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity
  and Alcian Blue staining (magnification: 100×) (left panel) were used to detect
  these. Representative photomicrograph of the SA-β-gal assay is shown. The percentage
  of β-galactosidase-positive cells in each group was compared and is illustrated
  in the histogram; n = 3 in each experiment. e) and f) The chondrocytes were transiently
  transfected with p67phox (pcDNA-p67phox), pcp67△ AD (a.a 199 to 212), or control
  (pcDNA3.1) plasmid, to detect the mRNA and protein expression of COL2A1 and aggrecan
  as indicated by using RT-PCR or western blot. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
  compared with untreated control. shRNA, short hairpin (sh) RNA.'
