caption: 'IL-6 activates both the uptake and utilization of fructose. (A) A schematic
  of fructose metabolism. Distinct metabolic pathways are shown with arrows in different
  colors: glycolysis and TCA cycle in blue, fructolysis pathway in green, nucleotide
  and RNA synthesis in yellow, fatty acid and membrane biosynthesis in purple, and
  amino acids and protein biosynthesis in brown. (B, D) DU145 and HSC-3 cells were
  stimulated with IL-6 (50 ng/mL) for 24 h, and the level of cellular fructose (B)
  and GA3P (D) was measured. Data represent the mean and SD from three independent
  experiments. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. (C, E-G) DU145 and HSC-3 cells
  were stimulated with IL-6 (50 ng/mL) for 24 h, and then incubated with 10 ÂµCi [14C]-fructose
  for 30 min (C) or 1 h (E-G). The level of radiation signal in whole cell lysate
  (B), total protein (E), total RNA (F) or cell membrane fraction (G) was measured.
  Data represent the mean and SD from three independent experiments. *P < 0.05; **P
  < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.'
