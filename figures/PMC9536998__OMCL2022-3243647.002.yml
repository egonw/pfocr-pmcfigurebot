caption: '(a, b) K-M survival plots of PDA patients in TCGA cohort (A) and PDA gemcitabine
  users in Huashan cohort (B). (c) Heat map of the top 30 genes differentially expressed
  between the normal and the diabetic PDA patients (blue = normal group, red = DM group).
  (d) Volcano plot of DEGs between normal and diabetic PDA patients in TCGA database
  (up: upregulated genes, down: downregulated genes). (e) GSEA analysis of pathways
  enriched in the diabetic group. (f) GO and KEGG analyses of the pathways enriched
  in the DM group. (g) Pan-cancer analysis of MMP-3 expression between the normal
  tissue and the cancerous tissue based on the TCGA database (∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001).'
