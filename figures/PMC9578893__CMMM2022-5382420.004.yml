caption: 'Western blot analysis of proteins involved in the TGF-β signaling pathway.
  GAPDH was used as an internal control. The Western blot results and the corresponding
  statistical histograms of p-Samd2/Smad2 (a), p-Smad3/Smad3 (b), and p-Src/Src (c)
  were shown. Besides, the expression levels of TGF-βRI, SNAIL, SLUG, and pY658 were
  detected by Western blot and analyzed by histograms as well. ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P <
  0.01; #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01; $P < 0.05 and $$P < 0.01; &P < 0.05 and &&P < 0.01.'
