caption: NCOA7 expression levels and its prognostic roles in three subtypes of RCC.
  (A,C,E) The different expression levels of NCOA7 in the three subtypes of RCC tissues
  and adjacent normal tissues. (B,D,F) The different expression levels of NCOA7 in
  the three subtypes of RCC tissues and paired normal tissues. (G,I,K) Overall survival
  curve of three subtypes of RCC patients with low and high NCOA7 expression in the
  TCGA database. (H,J,L) Progress free survival curve of three subtypes of RCC patients
  with low and high NCOA7 expression in the TCGA database. KIRC, kidney renal clear
  cell carcinoma; KICH, kidney Chromophobe; KIRP, kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma.
