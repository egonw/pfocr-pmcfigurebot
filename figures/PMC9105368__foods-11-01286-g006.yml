caption: 'Lipid metabolic pathway analysis of the identified differential lipid species.
  (The circle size and x-axis represent the pathway impact value, and the circle color
  and y-axis is the -log (p-value) obtained from pathway enrichment analysis. 1: pathway
  of biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids; 2: pathway of glycerophospholipid metabolism;
  3: pathway of linoleic acid metabolism; 4: pathway of alpha-linolenic acid metabolism;
  5: pathway of glycerolipid metabolism; 6: pathway of sphingolipid metabolism; 7:
  pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism.)'
