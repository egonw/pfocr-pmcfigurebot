caption: STA affects the glucose metabolism pathway of Hep3B cells. (A) The PCA score
  plot of Control and Drug group (30 μM), it represents samples in the groups were
  closely cluster to one another. (B) The OPLS-DA score plot of Control and Drug group
  revealed the clustering of samples in the training set. (C) Metabolites altered
  by STA treatment in Hep3B cells. n = 8 replicates per group. (D) Pathway enrichment
  of differential metabolites. Mainly enriched in fructose and pentose phosphate metabolism
  and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis.
