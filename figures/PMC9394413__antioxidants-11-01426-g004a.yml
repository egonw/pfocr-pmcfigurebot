caption: NRF2-signalling-based therapeutic strategies in brain dysfunctions. Targeting
  NRF2 pathway in brain diseases appears as a promising therapeutic strategy. Different
  options exist depending on the context (cancer (A), ageing (B), and neurodegenerative
  diseases (C)), NRF2 levels, and the cells to target (neuronal or glial cells). NRF2
  and NRF2-negative regulators (KEAP1, BACH1, BACH2) can be targeted in these different
  conditions. The emergence of senotherapeutic drugs (senolytics, senomorphics) coupled
  to epigenetic modifiers (inhibitors/activators of histone acetyltransferases, histone
  deacetylases, histone demethylases, and histone methyltransferases) could provide
  a great number of translational opportunities and thus contribute to improving human
  health.
