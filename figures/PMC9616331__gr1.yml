caption: 'Signaling pathway of adrenomedullin (AM) in cells forming the blood-brain
  barrier.AM binds to a heterodimer receptor composed of the calcitonin receptor-like
  receptor (CLR) and receptor activity-modifying protein type 2 (RAMP2) or 3 (RAMP3),
  termed AM1 and AM2 receptors, respectively. Upregulation of AM in endothelial cells
  by hypoxic-ischemic injury, shear stress, or proinflammatory cytokines induces angiogenesis
  through activation of Akt, MAPK, and FAK in an autocrine manner. AM directly binds
  to AM receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and induces SMC migration
  and vasodilation. AM also promotes differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor
  cells into mature oligodendrocytes under hypoxic conditions. These activities may
  synergistically serve as protective factors, mitigating against cerebrovascular
  diseases such as ischemic stroke and vascular cognitive impairment.Abbreviations:
  cAMP, adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate; cGMP, guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate;
  eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase;
  FAK, focal adhesion kinase; IP3, inositol triphosphate; MEK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase; NO, nitric oxide; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PKA, protein kinase
  A; PKG, protein kinase G.'
