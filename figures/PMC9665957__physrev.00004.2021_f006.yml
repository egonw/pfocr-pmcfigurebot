caption: 'Airway surface liquid volume regulation. A: diagram of purinergic signaling
  pathways that coordinately control directions/rates of transepithelial ion and fluid
  transport and ciliary beat frequency (CBF) by the two major lumen-facing epithelial
  cell types, i.e., ciliated and secretory cells. The pannexin 1 (PANX1) ATP-releasing
  apical membrane hemichannel, cell surface/shed extracellular enzymes that metabolize
  ATP, ADP, AMP, and adenosine (ADO) (ENTPDases, 5′-NT), apical purinoceptors (nucleotide,
  P2Y2R; nucleoside, A2B), and regulated CFTR, ENaC, and Ca2+-activated (CaCC) ion
  channels shown. Purinoceptors and ecto-enzyme nucleotide/nucleoside metabolic enzymes
  are depicted as commonly expressed in both ciliated and secretory cells. Pannexin-1
  (PANX-1)-mediated ATP release from ciliated cells consequent to cilia-mucus sensing
  (see ) regulates cilial beat frequency in an autocrine fashion and regulates ion
  transport in secretory cells in a paracrine fashion. The extracellular metabolite
  of ATP, i.e., adenosine, also regulates CBF and ion transport in autocrine and paracrine
  fashions, respectively. In secretory cells, ATP is imported into mucus granules
  (MG) via the vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT) and metabolized to ADP and
  AMP. These nucleotides are co-released with mucins and, via metabolism to adenosine,
  trigger autocrine ion/fluid secretion to hydrate the newly secreted mucins. Note,
  although not depicted for simplicity, P2Y2R is expressed on secretory cells and
  when activated triggers mucin secretion. The absence of co-release of ATP with secreted
  mucins protects from excessive, autocrine-mediated ATP mucin secretion. Also not
  depicted for simplicity, ADP/AMP release from secretory cells likely also provides
  adenosine for regulation of ciliary beat frequency in adjacent ciliated cells. Thus
  nucleotide release exhibits critical autocrine and paracrine signaling properties
  for coordination of efficient mucus transport. B: control of airway surface liquid
  volume/surface area (height) by purinergic signaling as imaged by X-Z confocal microscopy.
  Bi: addition of fluorescent dextran-containing solution to cultured human airway
  surface without (top) or with (bottom) subsequent aspiration at time (t) 0 is followed
  by autoregulation over 4–6 h to a common height that is governed by rates of ATP
  release and conversion to ADO (courtesy of Dr. Robert Tarran, University of North
  Carolina-Chapel Hill). N = 8. Bii: basal ATP release and conversion to ADO governs
  Na+ vs. Cl− transport rates to generate basal ASL heights of ∼7 µm. Addition of
  enzymes to metabolize extracellular ATP (apyrase, APY) and adenosine (adenosine
  deaminase, ADA) abolishes the ability of the human bronchial epithelial (HBE) culture
  to maintain a 7-µm ASL height (blue dashed line). The default Na+ absorptive pathway
  removes all available ASL (). Biii: dependence of ASL on concentration of added
  nonmetabolizable adenosine analog 5′-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA). Higher
  NECA concentrations stimulate higher fluid secretion rates and higher steady-state
  ASL height (). Biv: CF vs. normal ASL homeostasis under static conditions. In contrast
  to normal cultures, CF cultures cannot maintain adequate airway surface volumes
  (height) under static conditions. Levels of ASL adenosine and A2B expression are
  similar in CF and normal HBE cultures (). The failure of the mutant CFTR to secrete
  Cl−/fluid and moderate ENaC-mediated Na+ absorption drives ASL depletion in CF.
  C: control of airway surface hydration during tidal breathing. Ci: under static
  conditions, ATP release rates are fixed at ∼400 fmol/cm2/min and generate an ∼7-µm-deep
  ASL layer height. The mechanical shear and transmural stretch imparted onto airway
  epithelia during normal breathing increase ATP release rates via PANX-1 hemichannels.
  As a result, ASL ATP levels increase, which inhibits Na+ absorption, increases (via
  metabolism-generated ADO) Cl−/fluid secretion, and increases ASL volume/height.
  Fluid secretion dilutes mucus concentrations (depicted as % organic solids). Cii:
  relationship between the magnitude of changes in luminal ATP concentrations and
  ASL height. Human airway cultures were subjected to varying degrees of oscillatory
  stress during measurements of luminal [ATP] and steady-state ASL heights. These
  data revealed a direct relationship between [ATP] and changes in ASL height (correlation
  coefficient = 0.95 and slope = 0.3 mm height per steady-state change in ATP concentration)
  (). D: airway epithelial autoregulation of proper surface hydration states, i.e.,
  97.5% water, 1.5% organic solids, 1% salt mucus, is mediated by mechanotransduction
  sensing by motile cilia. Motile cilia interact with mucus layer and transfer momentum
  to the layer. The yield stress of the mucus layer in response to ciliary beat is
  a function of mucus concentration. If mucus becomes hyperconcentrated/dehydrated,
  mucus layer yield stress increases (right). The decreased deformability (higher
  yield stress) of the mucus layer increases the strain on the ciliary shaft during
  ciliary beating, which promotes PANX-1-mediated increases in ATP release (bottom).
  Increased ATP release increases local ATP concentrations, increases fluid secretion
  (left), and rehydrates mucus to favorable homeostatic states in an autoregulatory
  feedback loop (top) (). E: requirement for motile cilia in autoregulation of mucus
  hydration. Cilia from normal subjects respond to hyperconcentrated (6%) mucus with
  an increase in ATP release and a higher steady-state concentration of ATP within
  ASL. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) cultures, with absent cilial motility, fail
  to sense mucus hyperconcentration and accelerate ATP release/increase ATP concentrations
  within ASL. See glossary for other abbreviations. Content from Ref.  used with permission
