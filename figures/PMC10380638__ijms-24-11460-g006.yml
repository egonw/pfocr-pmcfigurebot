caption: 'IR-induced innate and adaptive antitumor response (simplified scheme) inspired
  by [,,]: steps of the innate and immune response pathway involving mitochondrial
  functions. Change of the mitochondrial outer membrane potential (MOMP) followed
  by the release of mtDNA into the cytosol and the formation of a dimeric complex
  between mtDNA and cGAS. This leads to the synthesis of cGAMP binding to STING, which
  recruits TBK1, activating the IRF3-dependent type I IFN response cytokine release,
  activating dendritic cells (DCs). DCs can, in turn, activate T cells (CD8+) that
  determine the immunogenic antitumor response.'
