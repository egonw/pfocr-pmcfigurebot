caption: Shake-flask fermentation evaluation of C. glutamicum SO26 on different carbon
  sources. A l-Ornithine concentration in the fermentation liquids of C. glutamicum
  SO26 cultivated on glucose (solid black square), sucrose (solid blue cycle), and
  glucose plus sucrose (solid pink triangle). B Cell growth of C. glutamicum SO26
  cultivated on glucose (solid black square), sucrose (solid blue cycle), and glucose
  plus sucrose (solid pink triangle). C Sugar consumption of C. glutamicum SO26 cultivated
  on glucose (solid black square), sucrose (solid blue cycle). D Sugar consumption
  of C. glutamicum SO26 cultivated on glucose plus sucrose. Black square represents
  fructose, red cycle represents glucose, and blue triangle represents sucrose. Data
  are averages and standard deviations from three independent experiments
article_title: Enhanced l-ornithine production from glucose and sucrose via manipulation
  of the fructose metabolic pathway in Corynebacterium glutamicum.
