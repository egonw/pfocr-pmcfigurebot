caption: Role of GR agonist dexamethasone (Dexa) and MR antagonist potassium canrenoate
  (Cane) in the modulation of inflammation‐induced nociceptive behavior in the right
  hind paw. (A and C) Four days of Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) of the right hind
  paw resulted in dose‐dependently reduced paw withdraw mechanical threshold (PWMT)
  compared to baseline values (0 min). Increasing doses of intraplantar Dexa (A) or
  Cane (C) reversed the already reduced mechanical hypersensitivity within minutes
  (p < .05; two‐way ANOVA, Bonferroni test, n = 6). Both Dexa and Cane show a transient
  attenuation via GR and MR during rat hind paw inflammation. Data are expressed as
  mean ± SD. BL, baseline. (B and D) ROC curves and AUC values of Dexa and Cane in
  the ipsilateral side of FCA‐induced inflammatory pain. ANOVA, analysis of variance;
  AUC, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; GR, glucocorticoid
  receptor; MR, mineralocorticoid receptor; ROC, receiver operating characteristic
  curve.
