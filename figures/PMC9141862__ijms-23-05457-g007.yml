caption: (a) MapMan-based “metabolic overview map” of DEGs in the “S3_HG vs. S1_HG”
  group, including lipid, cell wall, secondary metabolism, starch, sucrose, tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle, amino acid, and light reaction components. The small heat map
  in each section of the diagram shows the DEGs mapped to that pathway, and a small
  square indicates a gene. The color of the square indicates the expression of the
  gene at S3, with green and red indicating down-regulation and up-regulation, respectively.
  (b) Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to starch, sucrose, and TCA metabolism
  during tangor fruit development and ripening. (c) DEGs related to cell wall metabolism
  during tangor fruit development and ripening. Heatmap of DEGs was drawn using the
  log2Foldchange value obtained from the pairwise comparison of samples. S3/S1, comparison
  group of S3 and S1; S2/S1, comparison group of S2 and S1; S3/S2, comparison group
  of S3 and S2. Red and green indicate up-regulation and down-regulation, respectively,
  in the former of the comparisons.
