caption: SerpinE2 activates β-catenin signaling pathway in cardiac fibroblasts. A.
  Co-staining of β-catenin and serpinE2 in cardiac fibroblasts (n = 4, Scale bars
  = 20 µm). B. Expression level of β-catenin was detected by ELISA assay after administration
  of serpinE2 antibody, heparin, nystatin, β-cyclodextrin (n = 6); C. mRNA level of
  β-catenin in cardiac fibroblasts after administration of serpinE2 antibody, heparin,
  nystatin, β-cyclodextrin (n = 6); D. Collagen expression level in CFs after treated
  with DKK1 (n = 5). Data are presented as mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p
  < 0.001, determined one-way ANOVA, Bonferroni's multiple comparisons test (B-D).
