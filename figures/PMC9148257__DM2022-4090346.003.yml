caption: Deguelin inhibits migration and invasion of NSCLC. (a and c) The cell scratch
  assay for A549 and PC9 cell migration after cells were transfected by PTEN-siR/overexpression,
  KLF4-siR/overexpression, and deguelin (25 μM), respectively. The migration area
  was counted. (b and d) The cell invasion assay for A549 and PC9 cells after cells
  were transfected by PTEN-siR/overexpression, KLF4-siR/overexpression, and deguelin
  (25 μM), respectively. The numbers of invasion cells were counted. Scale bar represents
  100 μm. All experiments were repeated at least in triplicate. The data are presented
  as the mean ± SD. Significant differences are indicated by ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
