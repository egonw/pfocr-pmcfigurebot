caption: qRT-PCR analysis of HG and LPS-induced THP-1 cells. HG and LPS induced high
  expression of SNHG16 and inflammatory factors in THP-1 cells, whereas inflammatory
  factors were downregulated after si-SNHG16 transfection (a, d). Immunofluorescence
  analysis demonstrated that HG increased the IL-1β fluorescence intensity in THP-1
  cells (b). ELISA demonstrated that HG and LPS upregulated the inflammatory factors
  in THP-1 cells, whereas the inflammatory factors were downregulated after si-SNHG16
  treatment (c)
article_title: Silencing LncRNA SNHG16 suppresses the diabetic inflammatory response
  by targeting the miR-212-3p/NF-κB signaling pathway.
