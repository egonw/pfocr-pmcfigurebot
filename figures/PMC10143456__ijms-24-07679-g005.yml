caption: 'Uremic serum promotes fibrogenesis of renal mesangial cells through the
  DKK1-mediated signaling pathway. (A) Western blot analysis of fibronectin (FBN),
  α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and collagen IV (COL-IV) expressed in mouse mesangial
  cells that were cultured in media with increasing concentrations (5, 10 and 20%)
  of healthy control serum or uremic serum. The healthy serum and uremic serum samples
  were pooled at equal volumes from blood samples of five healthy control subjects
  and five uremic patients, respectively. Quantitative data from Western blots are
  plotted as mean ± SD (n = 3). * p < 0.05 versus the healthy controls at the corresponding
  serum concentrations. (B) Western blot analysis of FBN, α-SMA and COL-IV expressed
  in mouse mesangial cells cultured in media with 20% healthy control serum or uremic
  serum for 24, 48 and 72 h. Quantitative data from Western blots are plotted as mean
  ± SD (n = 3). * p < 0.05 versus the healthy controls at the corresponding time points.
  (C) Serum DKK1 levels of five healthy control subjects and five uremic patients
  included in the in vitro experiments. (D) Effects of increasing amounts of anti-DKK1
  neutralizing antibody (16.5, 66 and 200 ng/mL) on the expression of FBN, α-SMA and
  COL-IV in mesangial cells cultured in media with 20% healthy control serum or uremic
  serum. Quantitative data from Western blots are plotted as mean ± SD (n = 3). *
  p < 0.05 versus the healthy controls, # p < 0.05 versus the untreated uremic serum
  group. (E) Effects of increasing amounts of an IgG control and anti-DKK1 antibody
  on the expression of profibrotic proteins in mesangial cells cultured in media with
  20% uremic serum. Quantitative data from Western blots are plotted as mean ± SD
  (n = 3). # p < 0.05 versus the untreated uremic serum group.'
