caption: Possible involvement of β‐adrenoceptors (β3‐ARs) in the pathogenesis of prematurity‐related
  diseases. β3‐AR upregulation under hypoxia causes vascular endothelial growth factor
  (VEGF)‐induced neovessel proliferation and vasodilation through the nitric oxide
  (NO) pathway. Conversely, exposure to normoxia (sensed as relative hyperoxia) determines
  vasoconstriction and vessel regression possibly through the downregulation of β3‐ARs.
  In the ductus arteriosus, in particular, β3‐ARs are downregulated after birth thus
  favoring its closure. The exposure to relative hyperoxia stops vascularization or
  even induces vascular regression, anatomical conditions common to the main pathologies
  related to prematurity. Whether vascular regression would be mediated by β3‐AR downregulation,
  then the perspective exists that β3‐AR activation might prevent disease progression
