caption: CXCR2 is controlled by IL4 signaling in macrophages, and it mediates the
  IL4-dependent transendothelial migration of tumor cells. (A) Top 5 canonical pathways
  derived from ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) for differentially expressed genes
  in BMDM stimulated with IL4. These pathways emerged following IPA “Core Analysis.”
  Graph shows category scores (y axis) based on the p-values derived from the Fisher’s
  exact test. The x axis displays the –log(p-value). The yellow threshold line represents
  a significance cutoff at p = 0.05. (B) Normalized level of mRNA expression measured
  by qPCR of IL-8 functional homologs CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL5 in macrophages after
  a 24 h stimulation with recombinant IL4 (n = 3, *** p-value <0.001; **** p-value
  < 0.0001). (C) Normalized level of expression of the mRNA Cxcr2 in macrophages after
  stimulation with IL4 (n = 4, ** p-value < 0.01). (D) Number of transmigrated E0771-LG
  cells in response to WT BMDMs treated with 100 µM SB332235 at the bottom chamber,
  recombinant CXCL1 in the receiving chamber or both (n = 3; **** p-value < 0.0001;
  ** p-value < 0.01). (E) Surface expression of CXCR2 determined by flow cytometry
  on 3B-11, Met-1, E0771-LG and WT BMDM (blue curve) compared to isotype control (light
  gray) and unstained control (dark gray). (F) Transendothelial migration of Met-1
  cells in response to WT or CXCR2−/− BMDM isolated from global knock-out Balb/c mice
  pretreated with recombinant IL4 (ANOVA and Dunnett correction, n = 3; * p-value
  < 0.05). (G) Transendothelial migration of E0771-LG cells in response to WT or Cxcr2fl/fl
  BMDM with or without Cre expression isolated fromLysM-Cre-CXCR2fl/fl mice (ANOVA
  and Dunnett correction, n = 4; ** p-value < 0.01). For all graphs, bars represent
  averages normalized to control +/− SD.
