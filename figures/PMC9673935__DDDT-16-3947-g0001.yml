caption: Molecular mechanisms of PARP inhibitors. PARPs bind to the DNA damage sites
  and induce a DNA damage response. PARP inhibitors trap the PARPs in DNA damage sites
  and prevent the recruitment of additional DNA repair proteins, which resulting in
  DSBs accumulation. HR proficient cells have the ability to repair the DSBs and restart;
  maintaining survival. But for HR deficient cells, NHEJ is the only pathway to use
  to repair DSBs, which can lead to accumulation of genome instability and results
  in cell death.
