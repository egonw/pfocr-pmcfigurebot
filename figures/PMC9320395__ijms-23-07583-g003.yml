caption: Bubble plot of the KEGG pathway enrichment of the target genes. The strength
  of the enriched signaling pathways associated with the target genes of the downregulated
  (DW) miRNAs (left panel) and upregulated (UP) miRNAs (right panel) in HTLV-2 infected
  PBMCs (upper panel) and BJABGu cells (bottom panel). The size and color of each
  bubble represent the number of target genes in each pathway and its corresponding
  p-value, respectively.
