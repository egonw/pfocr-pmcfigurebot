caption: The insulin-Akt-FOXO1 pathway acutely regulates A1R expression to modulate
  adenosine signaling in adipocytes. (A–F) 3T3-L1 adipocytes 10–12 days after differentiation
  were serum starved overnight and treated with insulin as indicated for either 4 h
  (mRNA analysis) or 15 min (phospho-protein western blot analysis). (A) Dose response
  of insulin effects on A1R expression in the presence or absence of 10% FBS. N = 5–6.
  (B) Time course for the suppression of A1R expression by 10 nmol/L insulin. N = 3–4.
  (C) Effect of vehicle (white) or 1 nmol/L insulin (red) on A1R mRNA expression,
  phospho-MAPK (T202/Y204), and phospho-Akt (S473) after 15-minute pre-treatment with
  vehicle (Veh), 50 μmol/L LY294002 (LY), or 25 μmol/L PD98059 (PD). (D) Effect of
  1 nmol/L insulin on A1R mRNA expression, phospho-GSK3α/β (S21/S9), and phospho-P70
  S6K (T389) after 15-minute pre-treatment with vehicle (Veh), 25 μmol/L MK-2206 (MK),
  or 250 nmol/L rapamycin (Rapa). (E) Effect of 1 nmol/L insulin on A1R mRNA expression
  and phospho-GYS (S641) after 15-minute pre-treatment with vehicle (Veh), 1.4 μmol/L
  GSK3 inhibitor IX (GSK3i), or 30 mmol/L LiCl. (F) Effect of 1 nmol/L insulin on
  A1R mRNA expression and nuclear localization of FOXO1 after 15-minute pre-treatment
  with vehicle (Veh) or 1 μmol/L AS-1842856 (AS). (G) Fold-enrichment by ChIP with
  FOXO1 over normal rabbit IgG of A1R promoter region (A1R) or 28S rDNA control region
  (28S) after 4-hour treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with vehicle (white) or 1 μmol/L
  AS1842856 (blue). (H) NEFA released into the media by isolated adipocytes that were
  treated with vehicle or 1 μmol/L AS-1842856 for 4 h, followed by vehicle or 100 nmol/L
  CCPA for 15 min in the presence of adenosine deaminase and a subsequent 30-minute
  treatment with vehicle or 30 nmol/L isoproterenol. Error bars represent SD. ∗p < 0.05,
  ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001, one-way or two-way ANOVA.
