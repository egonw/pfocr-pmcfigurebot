caption: 'Overview of tumor endothelial cell (TEC) metabolism. (A) Phenotypically,
  TECs show a high replication rate coupled to invasiveness, over-expression of receptors,
  and pro-angiogenic growth factors such as the vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular
  endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGF/VEGFR2) axis, cytogenetic alterations,
  stemness and chemotherapy resistance, the ability to grow in serum-free media, and
  reduced senescence and apoptosis. (B) The main metabolic pathways reported so far
  in the remodeling of endothelial cell metabolism in cancer context. Proliferating
  TECs strongly depend on glycolysis and glucose uptake to produce adenosine triphosphate
  (ATP). Glycolysis provides the energy necessary to guide TEC proliferation and migration;
  lactate present in tumor microenvironment is imported into TECs through monocarboxylate
  transporter 1 (MCT-1) and can fuel vessel sprouting by two ways. By activating the
  nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) pathway that
  up-regulates interleukin 8 (IL-8) and leads to the IL-8 self-stimulation, or by
  converting into pyruvate that inhibits prolyl hydroxylase (PHD2) activating hypoxia-inducible
  factor 1 alpha (HIF1α); Fatty acids oxidation (FAO) provides intermediate metabolites
  and biomass to support sprouting vessels. The EC-specific deletion of both carnitine
  palmitoyltransferase 1a and 2 (CPT1a and CPT2, respectively), genes that regulate
  the carnitine shuttle, cause vessel leakage; gasotransmitters such as hydrogen sulfide
  (H2S) and nitric oxide (NO) play a pleiotropic role by altering the proteome of
  cells and their pro-angiogenic action affects metabolism; extracellular matrix stiffness
  promotes tumor vessels formation by yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional
  coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) activation and leads to angiogenesis. The
  enzymes/transporters directly involved in tumor angiogenesis are highlighted in
  red. (C) Metabolic interaction within individual pathways in TECs. The Figure was
