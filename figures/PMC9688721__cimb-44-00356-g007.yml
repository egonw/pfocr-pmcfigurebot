caption: Impacts of quercetin on the NF-κB signalling system. BIECs were treated with
  80 μg/mL quercetin in an environment of 5 μg/mL LPS for 6 h. (A) Western blot evaluation
  of p-IκBα and p-p65. (B) Relative protein expression levels of p-IκBα to GAPDH.
  (C) Relative protein expression levels of p-p65 to GAPDH. The results are mean ±
  SEM (n = 3). Various lowercase letters in line graphs reveal significant changes
  (p < 0.05).
