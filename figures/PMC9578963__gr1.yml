caption: PTEN/PI3Kα/Akt pathway at the plasma membrane and at the endosomes. PI3Kα
  binds to the activated receptor and is anchored by RAS on the membrane in order
  to convert PI(4,5)P2 to PI(3,4,5)P3 on the PM. PI(3,4,5)P3 activates the kinases
  PDK1 and Akt. Akt gets phosphorylated and activated by both PDK1 and mTORC2. Akt
  promotes cell survival, growth and proliferation through important downstream targets
  including MDM2, BAD, FOXO and GSK3 as well as protein synthesis by inhibiting TSC1/2,
  enabling the GTPase Rheb to activate mTORC1 which subsequently phosphorylates 4EBPs
  proteins , , . The negative regulator of this pathway, PTEN, antagonizes PI3Kα performing
  the reverse reaction. Recruitment of PI3Ks and phosphatases at the plasma membrane
  and at the endosomal membranes is responsible for regulating endocytic transport
  of growth factor receptors, thus affecting receptor fate and downstream signaling.
