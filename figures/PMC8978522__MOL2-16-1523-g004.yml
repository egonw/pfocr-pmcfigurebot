caption: SMAR1‐mediated regulation of STAT3 upon LPS treatment. Western blot showing
  reduced STAT3 expression in (A) CT26 cell line upon LPS treatment. SMAR1 and TOPORS
  expressions increase in CT26 (mouse colon cancer) cell line as well. (B) Representative
  FACS plot along with graph showing median fluorescent intensity. (C) Immunofluorescence
  images depicting the expression of SMAR1 and TOPORS in CT26 cell line. (D) Confocal
  images showing the expression of IRF3 and STAT1 under LPS‐treated conditions in
  HT29 and CT26 cell lines. The scale bar represents 20 μm. Western blot representing
  the (E) expression status of pSTAT3 during SMAR1 knockout conditions in peritoneal
  macrophages (n = 6) with or without LPS treatment and (F) expression of SMAR1, TOPORS,
  and STATs in peritoneal macrophages during dose‐dependent LPS treatment. (G) Representative
  FACS plots of M1 (F4/80+ CD 86+)‐ and M2 (F4/80+ CD 206+)‐polarized peritoneal macrophage
  (n = 12) using CM collected from CT26 cells with or without LPS. β‐Actin was used
  as an endogenous loading control in all the western blots. The values below the
  blot represent the fold change relative to control, which was calculated after normalization
  with β‐actin. Data shown are representative of three independent experiments. Error
  bars indicate that all the values are mean ± SD, where *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ad
  ***P < 0.001 (two‐way ANOVA, Bonferroni post‐tests).
