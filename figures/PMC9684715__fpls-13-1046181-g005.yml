caption: Promoted lignin biosynthesis and reinforced SA accumulation and response
  by JR48. (A) Lignin content during pathogen infection. Leaves of pre-treated wild-type
  Arabidopsis Col-0 were infiltrated with Xcc 8004. Lignin content was determined
  at the indicated time points (mean ± SD; n (number of leaves) ≥ 12; **P < 0.01,
  Student’s t-test). Experiments were repeated in triplicate. DW, dried weight. (B,C)
  Relative expression of genes involved in lignin biosynthesis (B) and plant hormone
  signaling pathway (C). Relative expression of the indicated genes in Arabidopsis
  Col-0 at 12 h post Xcc infection was determined. Each value represented is mean
  of three replicates and error bars indicate SD. Asterisks indicate significant differences
  (*P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01, Student’s t-test). This experiment was repeated three
  times with similar results. (D) Free SA levels during pathogen infection. Pre-treated
  Arabidopsis leaves were inoculated with Xcc 8004. Free SA levels were measured at
  the indicated time points. Data are presented as means ± SD (n ≥ 12) calculated
  from three independent biological replicates (**P < 0.01, Student’s t-test). FW,
  fresh weight.
