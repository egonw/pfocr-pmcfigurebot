figure_title: ZNF276 activates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling by regulation of CYP1B1
caption: A, C Western blotting (A) and RT-qPCR (C) analysis revealed that silencing
  of CYP1B1 inhibited the expression of c-Myc and Cyclin D1 enhanced by ZNF276 overexpression
  in MDA-MB-231 cells. B, D Effects of ZNF276 knockdown and CYP1B1 overexpression
  on c-Myc and Cyclin D1 expression were analyzed in UACC-812 cells by western blotting
  (B) and RT-qPCR (D). E, F ZNF276 lacking C2H2 domain inhibited the TOP Flash activity
  enhanced by the intact ZNF276 with wnt3a activation in MDA-MB-231 (E) and UACC-812
  (F) cells. G Endogenous β-catenin expression and distribution was observed by immunofluorescence
  in MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with intact ZNF276 or ZNF276 lacking C2H2 domain
  plasmid. Nuc nuclear. Bar = 20 µm. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.
