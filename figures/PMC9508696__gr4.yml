caption: 'Infection with SARS-CoV-2 MA10 virus induces ADRD risk genes and complement
  activation in aged mice(A) Histograms depicting mRNA fold change of ADRD risk genes
  (Fkbp5, Ifitm3), and complement activation genes (Cr1, C5ar1), in brains collected
  from MA10-infected mice. (B) Bright-field images and respective quantification showing
  FKBP5 expression in the olfactory bulb, cortex, and hippocampus of MA10-infected
  20-month-old mice brains at 18 DPI. (C) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) network
  showing genes that are differentially expressed in cortex of infected aged mice
  (20 months old) 18 DPI as assayed by nCounter neuroinflammatory and glial profiling
  panel. n = 3; data expressed as mean ± SEM; ∗ compared with respective mock; # compared
  with respective 4 DPI; ∗p < 0.05 by ANOVA with Holm-Sidak test.'
