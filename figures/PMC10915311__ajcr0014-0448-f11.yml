caption: H&E stain and NTS stain on mouse primary tumors of shLuc-KPC and shNTSR1-KPC.
  (A) H&E stain and average nodule number per mouse were analyzed. NTS stain together
  with neural marker tubulin beta 3 class III (TUBB3) stain were performed on mouse
  primary tumors, and (B) NTS-positive area (middle) and intensity (right) as well
  as (C) TUBB3-positive area were analyzed. *, P<0.05. Scale bar, 50 Î¼m.
