figure_title: Expression of PARD6A regulates the protein levels of integrin β1 and
  ILK
caption: A Expression of PARD6A didn’t significantly affect protein levels of RhoA.
  a, b Protein levels of RhoA in SKOV3 (a) and A2780 cells (b) with PARD6A silenced.
  c, d Protein levels of RhoA in HO8910 (c) and OVAR8 cells (d) with PARD6A overexpressed.
  B Expression of PARD6A significantly affected cell adhesion. a, b Relative cell
  adhesion values of SKOV3 (a) and A2780 cells (b) with PARD6A silenced. c, d Relative
  cell adhesion values of HO8910 (c) and OVAR8 cells (d) with PARD6A overexpressed.
  Data shown are the mean values (±SD) from three independent experiments. Statistically
  significant differences with P < 0.05 were considered significant (***P < 0.001).
  C Expression of PARD6A regulates the protein levels of integrin β1. a, b Protein
  levels of Integrin β1 in SKOV3 (a) and A2780 cells (b) with PARD6A silenced. c,
  d Protein levels of Integrin β1 in HO8910 (c) and OVAR8 cells (d) with PARD6A overexpressed.
  D Expression of PARD6A regulates the protein levels of integrin β1. a, b Protein
  levels of ILK, p-GSK3β, and GSK3β in SKOV3 (a) and A2780 cells (b) with PARD6A silenced.
  c, d Protein levels of ILK, p-GSK3β, and GSK3β in HO8910 (c) and OVAR8 cells (d)
  with PARD6A overexpressed. E Representative images of immunohistochemistry detections
  of protein levels of ILK in serous, mucinous, and clear cell subtypes of ovarian
  cancer tissues versus normal ovarian epithial tissues. Scale bar = 50 µm. F, H Expression
  of ILK regulates expression of SNAIL1. F Protein levels of SNAIL1 in nuclear lysates
  and protein levels of ILK, p-GSK3β, and GSK3β in total protein lysates of SKOV3
  and A2780 cells with ILK silenced and those levels of the indicated proteins in
  HO8910 and OVAR8 cells with ILK overexpression, respectively. G Relative mRNA expression
  of SNAIL1 in SKOV3 and A2780 cells with ILK silenced and that of SNAIL1 in HO8910
  and OVCAR8 cells with ILK overexpression assessed by qRT-PCR. H Relative luciferase
  activity of pGL3-SNAIL1-promotor with/without ILK overexpression. I Scheme of the
  molecular pathways of EMT mediated by PAR6α-Integrin β1-ILK-SNAIL1 and finally implemented
  by E-cadherin and VIMENTIN.
