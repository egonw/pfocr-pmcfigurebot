figure_title: A genetic network in GBS for resisting Zn intoxication
caption: CopY represses copA but also activates sczA expression1; which in turn controls
  czcD for Zn efflux2; CopY also activates riboflavin synthesis and/or transport3,
  arginine deamination and transport4, other targets5 and represses adcA6. Zn intoxication
  is inhibitory towards Zn acquisition7, de novo nucleotide8 and riboflavin synthesis9
  pathways, cell wall synthesis genes10 and Stp111; Zn intoxication activates sczA12
  and arginine deaminase13. Stp1 represses activity of CovR14 and activates de novo
  purine synthesis15. CovR has activation roles for riboflavin16 and nucleotide synthesis
  genes17 and sczA18; Virulence and pathogenesis require contributions from CovR19
  and CopY20. Resistance to Zn stress requires functional czcD21, sczA22covR23, copY24
  and there are yet to be determined mechanisms of cell wall synthesis genes25, nucleotide26
  and riboflavin synthesis27 and arginine deamination28 processes that contribute
  to Zn resistance in GBS. Dotted lines indicate contributions that remain to be characterized.
  Terms activation and repression refer to gene or protein regulatory activities,
  inhibitory and contribution refer to pathway or process level interactions. Interactions
  are based on gene expression data, phenotypes of isogenic mutants, cell and animal
  assays or prior published literature [,,,,,].
