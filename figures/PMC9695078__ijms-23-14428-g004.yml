caption: Functional annotation of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs, padj <
  0.05 and fold change > 2) in ruminal epithelial cells (RECs) based on Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. (A) KEGG pathway of the overlapping
  DEGs that were downregulated in the Morusin+LPS group compared with LPS group and
  upregulated in the LPS group compared with NC group. (B) KEGG pathway of the overlapping
  DEGs that were upregulated in the Morusin+LPS group compared with LPS group and
  downregulated in the LPS group compared with NC group. Only the top 20 KEGG pathways
  with a p-value < 0.05 were presented. Circles indicate the numbers of enriched genes,
  and colors indicate the padj values. RECs were treated without (NC, n = 4) or with
  0.1 µg/mL lipopolysaccharide for 3 h after pretreating with 50 µg/mL of Morusin
  for 12 h (Morusin+LPS, n = 4) or not (LPS, n = 4).
