caption: 'Flow cytometry analysis with Annexin V. HT-29 cells were incubated 24 h
  with the treatments: 250 µM naringenin, 4.4 µM BPA, 37% FEN, co-treatment naringenin
  + BPA or co-treatment FEN + BPA, and blank of fermentation (10%) on. (a) All cells
  (b) Viable cells, (c) Necrosis cells, (d) Early apoptotic cells, (e) Late apoptotic
  cells. The experimental data are expressed as the mean value ± SD of the two independent
  experiments with two replicates each one. Letters indicate statistical difference
  (p < 0.05).'
