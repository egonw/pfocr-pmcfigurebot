caption: FA + p-CA are involved in the aerobic glycolysis pathway. The FA and p-CA
  target proteins were imported into the Metascape database for gene enrichment analysis.
  (Aâ€“C) Summary of enrichment analysis in WikiPathways (A), KEGG (B) and reactome
  pathway knowledgebase (C), colored by p-values, the color becomes lighter as the
  p-value increases. The red box shows that genes are enriched in the glycolytic pathway.
  (D) Aerobic glycolysis (WP4629) pathway involving FA and p-CA target proteins.
