caption: Carnosol inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in the early stage of
  differentiation. (A) Quantification of TRAP-positive cells following treatment with
  carnosol at different stages of differentiation in RAW264.7 cells. (B) Quantification
  of TRAP-positive cells following treatment with carnosol at different stages of
  differentiation in mouse bone marrow monocytes. (C) Semi-quantitative PCR and reverse
  transcription-quantitative PCR of NFATc1 in RAW264.7 cells following treatment with
  carnosol. Scale bar, 100 µm. **P<0.01 vs. RANKL. RANKL, receptor activator of NF-κB
  ligand; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase; NFATc1, recombinant nuclear factor
  of activated T cells.
