number: Fig.3. Elevated FGF23 activated the NF-κB signaling pathway in HUVECs
figure_title: ''
caption: '(A) Western blot analysis revealed representative results of p-p65, p65,p-IκBα,
  and IκBα protein expression after FGF23 treatment. (B) Quantitative analysis of
  the ratio of p-p65 to p65, p-IκBα, and IκBα to β-actin after FGF23 treatment (n=3).
  (C) Immunofluorescence detection of P65 NF-κB translocation in HUVECs after treatment
  with FGF23 (magnified, ×100, scale=100 µm). (D) HUVECs were incubated with the NF-κB
  inhibitor BAY11-7082 (10 µM) or FGFR antagonist BGJ398 (2 µM) for 30 min before
  treatment with FGF23, protein levels of p-p65 to p65, Cleaved-Caspase3, and Bax
  were determined via western blot analysis. (E) Results were quantified from the
  pixel values in grayscales (n=3). All experiments were repeated three times. ＊P＜0.05,
  ＊＊P＜0.01 vs. vehicle. #P＜0.05, ##P＜0.01 vs. FGF23 treatment.'
