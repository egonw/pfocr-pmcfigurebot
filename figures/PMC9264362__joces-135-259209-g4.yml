caption: Reduction of SHH signaling is independent of the AMPK–MTOR signaling axis.
  (A) Western blot analysis of NIH-3T3 WT and RMND5A KO cell extracts with the markers
  of the MTOR–autophagy pathway RPS6, p-RPS6 and LC3. Cells were cultured under cilia-induced
  condition (high glucose DMEM, 0.5% FCS) with or without SAG (100 nM) treatment for
  24 h. ACTB (β-actin) was used as a loading control. LC3, microtubule-associated
  protein 1A/1B-light chain 3; LC3-I, unlipidated cytosolic form of LC3; LC3-II, PEI-conjugated
  LC3 protein. (B,C) Quantification of western blotting as in A, showing the relative
  ratio between p-RPS6 and RPS6 (B), and between LC3-II and LC3-I (C). Data are mean±s.e.m.,
  n=3. *P<0.05 (two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test). (D) Western blot analysis of
  NIH-3T3 WT and KO cell extracts with the markers of the MTOR–autophagy pathway RPS6,
  p-RPS6 and LC3. Cells were cultured under non-starvation conditions (high glucose
  DMEM, 10% FCS) with or without rapamycin (50 nM or 100 nM) treatment for 24 h. ACTB
  was used as a loading control. Blots are representative of three individual experiments.
  (E) qPCR of relative mRNA levels of the SHH signaling marker Gli1 during rapamycin
  treatment. WT and KO cells were cultured under cilia-induced condition (high glucose
  DMEM, 0.5% FCS) with SAG (500 nM) and rapamycin (1 μM) treatment for 24 h as indicated.
  Mean±s.e.m., n=5. **P<0.01; ***P<0.001; ns, not significant (two-tailed unpaired
  Student's t-test). (F) qPCR of relative mRNA levels of the SHH signaling marker
  Gli1 during compound C treatment. WT and KO cells were cultured under cilia-induced
  condition (high glucose DMEM, 0.5% FCS) with SAG (100 nM) and compound C (10 μM)
  treatment for 24 h as indicated. Mean±s.e.m., n=6. **P<0.01; ns, not significant
  (two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test).
