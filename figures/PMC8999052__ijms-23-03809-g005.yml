caption: 'Bioinformatic analysis by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of the proteins
  differentially expressed in the comparisons between the high-fat and normal chow
  group. (A) Graphical summary of the bioinformatic analysis. Increased proteins/processes
  are indicated in orange and decreased proteins/processes are indicated in blue.
  (B) Toxicity list. For clarity, only the top 25 are indicated in the histograms.
  The histogram on the left reports the log p-value, and the significance threshold
  is indicated with the orange lane. The histogram on the right indicates the percentage
  of genes in our data set that are present in a specific cohort whose composition
  is indicated on top of each bar. Color code: red = upregulated proteins, green =
  downregulated proteins, white = no overlap with the data set.'
