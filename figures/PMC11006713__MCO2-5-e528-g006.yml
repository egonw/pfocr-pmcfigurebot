caption: Aberrant expression of lanosterol synthase (LSS) in human cancer tissues.
  (A and B) The RNA sequencing results of adjacent tissues (Pc) and cancer tissues
  (Ca) of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients in TCGA database were analyzed. Gene Ontology
  (GO) pathway enrichment (A) and significantly differentially expressed genes in
  cholesterol metabolism (B) were performed as indicated. (C and D) The expression
  of LSS gene in cancer tissues of CRC or breast cancer (BRCA) patients. The sample
  size is shown in the figure. The relevant data were obtained from GEPIA database.
  (E and F) The expression of LSS gene in different stages of CRC or BRCA. The relevant
  data were obtained from GEPIA database. (G and H) The correlation between LSS gene
  expression and survival in CRC or BRCA patients. The sample size is shown in the
  figure. The relevant data were obtained from GEPIA database. The survival rates
  were analyzed by Kaplan–Meier survival analysis. (I) The expression of LSS protein
  in cancer tissues of CRC or BRCA patients. The relevant data were obtained from
  UALCAN database. (J) Protein levels of LSS in cancer and paracancerous tissues of
  CRC patients. All data represent the mean ± S.E.M. Except (D), which was analyzed
  with Gehan–Breslow–Wilcoxon test, the rest were analyzed with Student's t‐test (*p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01 and S.E.M., Standard Error of Mean; TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas Program).
