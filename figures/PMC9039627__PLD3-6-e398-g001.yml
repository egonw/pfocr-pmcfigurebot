caption: '(a) Series of new compounds that have been modified from commercial calmodulin
  inhibitors, W7 and its less active analogue W5. The series are divided into two
  groups: chlorinated (AC1, AC2, AC3, AC4) and nonchlorinated (A1, A2, A3, A4). (b)
  Molecular structures of reported modulators of the GA signaling pathway; helminthosporal
  (B1), thiophenyl sulphone (B2), succinimide (B3), and AC94377 (B4)'
