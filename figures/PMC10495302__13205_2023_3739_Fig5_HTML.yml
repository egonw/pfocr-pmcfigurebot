caption: A rat model of pulmonary hypertension was established and a virus was designed
  to inhibit the expression of circDiaph3. Adenovirus-mediated in vivo inhibition
  of circDiaph3 expression in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) isolated
  from rats with PAH A Western blot analysis of α-SMA, Vcam1, and Igf1r signaling
  pathway proteins in rat pulmonary artery specimens. B qRT-PCR analysis of circDiaph3,
  α-SMA, Vcam1, and genes encoding Igf1r signaling pathway proteins in rat pulmonary
  artery specimens. C Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) analysis and immunofluorescence staining
  of α-SMA in rat pulmonary artery specimens. Data are presented as the mean ± standard
  deviation; *compared with the control group, p < 0.05
article_title: CircDiaph3 influences PASMC apoptosis by regulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
  through IGF1R.
