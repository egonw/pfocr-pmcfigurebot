caption: 'CircRNAs responsible for upregulation of glioblastoma growth: A schematic
  representation of the circRNAs involved in the regulation of glioma cell proliferation,
  migration, and invasion, among other functions. Numerous known circRNAs operate
  as miRNA sponges, subsequently increasing the amount of expression of the appropriate
  target gene. These target genes or proteins further influence downstream factors
  involved in cancer signaling pathways by functioning as transcription factors or
  regulatory proteins, as well as through other mechanisms. CircRNAs such as circ-CDC45,
  circ-0029426, circ-ENTPD7, circ-FLNA, hsa-circ-0076248, circ-0006168, circ-ABCC3,
  circ-LGMN, circ-FOXO3, hsa-circ-0005114, circ-0074027, circ-SKA3, circ-0001801,
  Circ-FOXM1, circ-NF1, circ-MELK, circ-NUP98, circ-ATXN1, circ-ARF1, circ-RFX3, and
  circ-PIK3C2A are responsible for the up-regulation of glioblastoma growth through
  different pathways including those of the IGF1R/Ras/Erk, Wnt/β-catenin, MMP2/VEGFA,
  PI3K/AKT, and FOXM1. For example, circ-RFX3 activates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway
  through miR-587.'
