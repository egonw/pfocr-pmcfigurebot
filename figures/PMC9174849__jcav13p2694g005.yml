caption: 'TMEM158 triggers EMT by activating the canonical and non-canonical TGF-β
  signaling pathways. (A) Western blot analysis of the TGF-β signaling pathway, phosphorylated
  ERK1/2, total ERK1/2 and epithelial/mesenchymal protein marker, in BT549 and HCC1187
  cells. (B) Effect of the ERK phosphorylation inhibitor PD98059 on ERK signaling
  in TMEM158 overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells. Western blotting analysis of proteins
  in the Smad-dependent pathway, phosphorylated ERK1/2, total ERK1/2 and epithelial/mesenchymal
  protein markers; the bar graph shows protein quantification. (C)-(E) The bar graphs
  show protein quantification. NC: negative control siRNA; Si1: TMEM158 siRNA1; Si2:
  TMEM158 siRNA2; OE: TMEM158 overexpression. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ns: nonsignificant'
