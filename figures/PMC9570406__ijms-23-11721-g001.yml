caption: 'Activation of mutant K-rasG12D induces PLA2G2A expression and the relationship
  between PLA2G2A expression and clinical outcomes of PDAC patients. (A) Schematic
  illustration of the PLA2G2A-mediated pathway with a release of PUFA for synthesis
  of eicosanoids. PLA2G2A, phospholipase A2 group IIA; PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty
  acid; COX, cyclooxygenase; CYP, cytochrome P450. (B) HPNE/K-rasG12D/OFF cells were
  incubated with 100 ng/mL doxycycline to induce K-rasG12D expression (left panel).
  After 1 month of stable K-ras induction, PLA2G2A mRNA level was quantified by qRT-PCR
  (right panel). (C) Correlation between expressions of K-ras and genes involved in
  eicosanoids synthesis using GEPIA database. PTGS1, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase
  1; CYP2J2, cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily J member 2. (D) Comparison of mRNA
  expression of eicosanoid synthesis-related genes in PDAC tumor (T) tissue (n = 179)
  and normal (N) pancreatic tissues (n = 171) using the GEPIA datasets. (E) Association
  between PDAC patient survival and the expressions of PLA2G2A, PTGS1, and CYP2J2.
  Statistical analyses: Spearmanâ€™s rank correlation test for (C); unpaired t-test
  for (D); Log-rank test for (E). *, p < 0.05; ****, p < 0.0001.'
