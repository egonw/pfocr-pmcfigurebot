figure_title: MarsGT identifies MAIT-like rare cell populations and eGRNs in multi-sample
  melanoma scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq
caption: a. UMAP visualizes MarsGTâ€™s predicted cell cluster results, annotated based
  on marker genes. b. Dotplot depicts the expression value and proportion of marker
  genes within the cell clusters predicted by MarsGT. c. UMAPS showcases the marker
  genes of MAIT cells. d. showcasing the marker genes of MAIT cells. The p-value is
  calculated by the Mann-Whitney U test with one-sided. e. The upset plot illustrates
  the peaks present in CD8+ T cell subpopulations. f. The upset plot demonstrates
  the genes found in CD8+ T cell subpopulations. g. Pathway enrichment across different
  MAIT-like cell populations. Colors represent distinct cell populations, while the
  size of the dots indicates the ratio of enriched genes. h. The expression and accessibility
  of ZBTB16-regulated genes across various MAIT cell populations. i. The regulatory
  relations of ZBTB16 in different MAIT-like cell populations. Green means the common
  regulatory relations between MAIT-like 1 and MAIT-like 2. Light blue means the regulatory
  relations unique in MAIT-like 1. Dark blue means the regulatory relations unique
  in MAIT-like 2.
