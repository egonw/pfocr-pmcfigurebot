caption: miR-128-3p negatively modulates PCDH11X in trophoblasts. (A) PCDH11X expression
  in normal placenta (n = 25) and PE placenta (n = 25) tissues was determined by q-PCR.
  (B) PCDH11X expression in normal placenta (n = 8) and PE placenta (n = 13) tissues
  was analyzed in a public database (GSE102897). (C and D) Spearman's correlation
  analysis was applied to detect the correlation between the expression of PCDH11X
  with SNHG22 (C) and miR-128-3p (D) in PE tissues (n = 25). (E) TargetScan database
  predicted a binding site between miR-128-3p and PCDH11X. (F) HTR-8/Svneo and JEG-3
  cells were co-transfected with miR-128-3p mimic or miR-128-3p inhibitor and PCDH11X-WT
  or PCDH11X-MUT, the luciferase activity of was determined by dual-luciferase reporter
  assay. (G-I) HTR-8/Svneo and JEG-3 cells were transfected with miR-128-3p mimic
  or miR-128-3p inhibitor, q-PCR (G), and Western blotting (H and I) were performed
  to detect PCDH11X expression. Experiments were replicated three times. **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001. Data are expressed as mean±SD.
