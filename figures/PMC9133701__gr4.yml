caption: 'CircPVT1/miR-423-5p/SMAD3 regulated cell viability, migration and invasion.
  GC cells were transfected with si-SMAD3/pc-SMAD3 alone, or were co-transfected with
  miR-423-5p mimic and pc-SMAD3, pc-SMAD3 and si-CircPVT1, si-SMAD3 and si-CircPVT1.
  (A–B) CircPVT1 expression. (C–D) SMAD3 mRNA expression. (E–F) miR-423-5p expression.
  (G–H) CCK8. (I–L) Transwell for migration and invasion. All experiments were repeated
  for three times. Mean and sd values were shown in the subfigures. ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001,
  vs NC; ##P=<0.002, ###P=<0.0002, ####P < 0.0001, vs pc-SMAD3 group; @@P=<0.002,
  @@@@P < 0.0001, vs si-SMAD3 group.'
