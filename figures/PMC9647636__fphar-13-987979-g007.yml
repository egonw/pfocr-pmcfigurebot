caption: 'Role of the TBK1/IKKε tandem in gene expression and tubular cell death triggered
  by a complex proinflammatory microenvironment. Gene expression was assessed by qRT-PCR
  and cell viability by the MTT assay throughout all the experiments. Cultured MCT
  cells were pretreated for 1 h with 50 μM amlexanox (AMX) to inhibit TBK1 and IKKε
  simultaneously (A–C) or with anti-IFNAR neutralinzing antibody (IFNAR-Ab) (D) and
  then exposed to a mixture of cytokines composed of TWEAK/TNFα/IFNγ (TTI). (A) Amlexanox
  prevents the TTI-induced transcription of cytokines (Cxcl10, Ccl5) and ISG (Ifit1).
  Mean ± SEM (n = 3-4). *p ≤ 0.05 vs Control; #p ≤ 0.05 vs TTI. (B) Amlexanox reduced
  the mRNA expression of the tubular stress markers Kim1 and Ngal in cells exposed
  for 6 h to TTI. Results are expressed as Mean ± SEM. *p ≤ 0.05 vs control; #p ≤
  0.05 vs TTI (n = 3). (C) Amlexanox reduced TTI-induced cell death (apoptosis) at
  24 h. Mean ± SEM, *p ≤ 0.05 vs control; #p ≤ 0.05 vs TTI (n = 4). (D) Antibody-mediated
  IFNAR blockade (IFNAR-ab) does not prevent cell death (apoptosis) induced by TTI.
  Mean ± SEM (n = 3), *p ≤ 0.05 vs Control. (E) Functional consequences of TBK1/IKKε
  inhibition with amlexanox on inflammation, ISG transcription, and cell death in
  tubular cells. Amlexanox prevents the activation of the TBK1/IKKε signaling node
  (green) and subordinated cytokine (red) and ISG (blue) expression, as well as cell
  death (apoptosis) triggered by TTI which is not dependent on IFNAR blockade (red
  cross).'
