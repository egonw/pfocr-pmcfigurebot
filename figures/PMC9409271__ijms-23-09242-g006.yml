caption: 'Differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) with KEGG pathway information
  and the enriched pathways of these DAMs. (A): DAMs in the leaves after CLas infection;
  (B): DAMs in the roots. The metabolites whose change did not meet the differentially
  accumulation threshold were filled with gray color in A and B. The upregulated and
  the downregulated ones were colored in red and blue, respectively. The cycle size
  indicated the VIP value in the OPLS-DA analysis; (C): Pathway enrichment analysis
  of the DAMs using the KEGG annotation background information detecting in the clusterProfiler
  software []. Only pathways with p-value < 0.05 in the Fisherâ€™s exact test were plotted.'
