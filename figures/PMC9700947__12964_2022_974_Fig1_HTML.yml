caption: 'RRP9 expression correlates to poor prognosis and low survival rates in PC
  patients. A RRP9 mRNA levels in 20 paired PC patient samples and adjacent non-tumor
  tissue. Data are denoted by mean ± SD, n = 20. B RRP9 protein levels in 11 paired
  PC patient samples and adjacent non-tumor tissue. Data are represented by mean ± SD,
  n = 11. C Immunohistochemical staining of RRP9 protein expression in human PC and
  adjacent non-tumor tissue, (pancreatic non-tumor tissue n = 20, PC n = 20, scale
  bar: 50 μm). D Kaplan–Meier analysis showing overall survival time of PC patients
  with different RRP9 expression levels, p values as indicated. (n = 177, p < 0.05).
  E RT-qPCR and western blot detections were carried out to measure RRP9 mRNA (left)
  and protein (right) expression levels in control HPDEC1 and PC cell lines PanC-1,
  CFPAC1, HPAC and BxPC-3 cells. Data are expressed by mean ± SD, n = 3, *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ****p < 0.0001'
