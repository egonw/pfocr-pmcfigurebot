caption: Transcriptional changes in lung cancer cells after inhibiting MAT2A. A, B.
  Heatmap and volcano plot displaying global transcriptional changes in H460/DDP cells
  compared with H460 cells. B. Each dot represents a gene, and the red dots represent
  up-regulated genes (4283), while the blue dots represent down-regulated genes (5841)
  (adjusted P<0.05) in H460/DDP cells. Differentially expressed genes of apoptosis,
  DNA repair and TNF signaling pathways are showing in a-b, respectively. C. KEGG
  analysis of signaling pathways involved in differentially expressed genes in H460/DDP
  cells or H460 cells. Each bar graph represents a pathway, and the length of the
  bar shows differential gene numbers in that pathway. D, E. Heatmap and volcano map
  showing all differentially expressed genes between control and PF9366 (10 μM)-treated
  H460/DDP cells. E. Each dot delegates a gene, and the red dots represent up-regulated
  genes (326), while the blue dots represent down-regulated genes (1093) (adjusted
  P<0.05) in H460/DDP cells with the treatment of PF9366. Differentially expressed
  genes of apoptosis, DNA repair and TNF signaling pathways are shown in a-c, respectively.
  F. KEGG analysis of signaling pathways for differentially expressed genes in H460/DDP
  cells under control and PF9366 (10 μM) treatment. Shown in the bar graph is pathway
  analysis of differentially expressed genes. Bar length represents the number of
  genes. G, H. Venn diagram showing the overlapping of differential signaling pathways
  in H460/DDP cells vs H460 (Red), and H460/DDP cells treated with PF9366 vs. control
  (Green). Bar length represents differentially expressed gene numbers. I. The seq-data
  showing the expression of CASP7 and CASP8 in each group as indicated.
