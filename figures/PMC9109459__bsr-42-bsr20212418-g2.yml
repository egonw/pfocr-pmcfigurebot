figure_title: IL-6 specifically up-regulated LCN2 protein and mRNA levels in human
  CRC cells
caption: (A,B) After stimulation with IL-6, protein and mRNA of DLD-1 cells were isolated.
  Then, Western blotting and reverse-transcriptase PCR were performed. The top images
  are Western blots and lower images are reverse-transcriptase PCR. (C) Human CRC
  cell lines, SW480 and HT-29, were stimulated with 50 ng/ml IL-6 for 24 h, then the
  levels of LCN2 protein and mRNA were detected. All images are representatives from
  at least three independent experiments.
