caption: Thrombin-activated NF-κB pathway in endothelial cells. Thrombin activates
  its receptor, the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) protease-activated receptor
  (PAR-1), by cleaving the extracellular domain to stimulate signaling. The Gβγ subunit
  activates phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt, which phosphorylates the IKK
  complex to activate canonical NF-κB signaling and induce RelA/p65 homodimer translocation
  to the nucleus. Gαq phosphorylates protein kinase C delta (PKCδ), which activates
  NF-κB by dual mechanisms. It induces IKK complex phosphorylation to release RelA/p65
  for its translocation and DNA binding in the nucleus. It also engages p38 and c-Src/spleen
  tyrosine kinase (Syk) to phosphorylate RelA/p65 and enhance its transcriptional
  activity. Whereas p38 causes serine phosphorylation (red), c-Src and Syk cause tyrosine
  phosphorylation (purple).
