caption: 'Diet overlay assay for the validation of selected flavonoids on H. armigera.
  Response of H. armigera larvae to artificial diet feeding assay incorporated with
  water-soluble flavonoids in 10 and 100 ppm concentrations. (A) Representative image
  of larvae that fed on flavonoids-incorporated artificial diet (B) Average length
  of larvae in cm; mean ± SE, n = 10 (C) Average larval weight in mg; mean ± SE, n
  = 10 (D) Average larval period in days; mean ± SE, n = 10. The larval length, weight,
  and duration were compared between control and respective treatments by student’s
  t-test; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.001. WC: Water control; EC3G: Epicatechin-3-gallate;
  EGC: Epigallocatechin.'
