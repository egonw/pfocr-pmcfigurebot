caption: Inhibition of miR-98-5p activates the PI3K/AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway. (A)
  Western blotting of proteins. (B) The protein expression levels of p-P13K/P13K after
  silencing miR-98-5p in HG-induced osteoblasts. (C) The protein expression levels
  of p-AKT/AKT after silencing miR-98-5p in HG-induced osteoblasts. (D) The protein
  expression levels of p-GSK3β/GSK3β after silencing miR-98-5p in HG-induced osteoblasts.
  Data are presented as the mean ± SD. *P<0.05, ***P<0.001. MC3T3-E1 (Dif), MC3T3-E1
  cells that were cultured in a differentiation medium for 14 days; miR, microRNA;
  p-, phosphorylated; NC, negative control; HG, high glucose.
article_title: Inhibition of miR-98-5p promotes high glucose-induced suppression of
  preosteoblast proliferation and differentiation via the activation of the PI3K/AKT/GSK3β
  signaling pathway by targeting BMP2.
