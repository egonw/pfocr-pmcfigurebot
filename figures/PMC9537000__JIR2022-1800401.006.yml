caption: Effect of the conciliatory anti-allergic decoction on airway remodeling in
  asthmatic mice. (a) Representative photographs of Mason, PAS, and TUNEL-stained
  lung sections from asthmatic mice induced by RSV (Bar =100 μm or 50 μm). (b-d) The
  collagen deposition, airway wall thickness, and apoptotic cells were measured in
  asthmatic mice. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, compared with the MC group.
