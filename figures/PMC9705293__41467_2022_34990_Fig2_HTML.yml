figure_title: Single-cell analysis of human diabetic testis suggests impaired cell
  junction in BTB
caption: a Scatter plot showing the DEGs in Sertoli cells between diabetic patients
  and normal spermatogenesis. b Enriched GO terms in the upregulated and downregulated
  genes of Sertoli cells from diabetic versus with normal control. The statistical
  test is a hypergeometric test. c GSEA analysis showing the upregulated and downregulated
  pathway activity in Sertoli cells. d Boxplots showing the expression levels of Activation
  NMDARS, Pyruvate metabolism, P38 MAPK pathway, BTB related genes (Normal = 43 cells,
  DM = 42 cells). Each box represents the median and the 25% and 75% quartiles, and
  the whiskers indicate 1.5 times of the interquartile range. e Heatmap showing the
  representative decreased metabolic pathway activity from the normal control and
  diabetic data in Sertoli cells. f H&E staining of adult human testicular paraffin
  sections from donors with normal control (left) and diabetic (right), arrow indicated
  vacuoles and free cells in seminiferous tubules. Scale bar, 20 μm. g–j Immunofluorescence
  of GJA1, TJP1, NACM1 and CDH2 (red) co-stained with DDX4 (green) in normal and diabetic
  patients’ testicular paraffin sections. n = 3 testis samples per group. Representative
  immunofluorescence images and quantitative analysis of GJA1, TJP1, NACM1 and CDH2.
  Scale bar, 10 μm. Representative immunofluorescence images and quantitative analysis
  of CDH2. Scale bar, 10 μm. Fluorescence intensity values of more than 50 positive
  cells in at least 5 fields of view were counted in normal and diabetic patients’
  testicular paraffin sections. Two-tailed student’s t test was performed. Box-and-whisker
  plots denote the maximum (top whisker), 75th (top edge of box), 25th (bottom edge
  of box), and minimum (bottom whisker) percentiles, and the median (line in box).
