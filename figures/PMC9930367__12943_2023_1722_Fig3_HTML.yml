caption: Crosstalk between γδT cells and the TME. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells
  (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), neutrophils with a suppressive phenotype and
  related immunosuppressive molecules in the tumor microenvironment (TME) can inhibit
  γδT cells. The binding of glycoimmune checkpoint molecules and BTNL2 to their receptors
  can lead to the recruitment of MDSCs. Under the action of some cytokines, such as
  TGF-β, IL-4, and IL-10, in the TME, γδT cells can differentiate into cells with
  a suppressor phenotype and upregulate the expression of CD39/CD73, which can promote
  γδT cell exhaustion. γδT cells gradually develop dysfunctional characteristics,
  such as decreased secretion of perforin, granzyme and IFN-γ; in contrast, γδT cells
  secrete IL-17/A, which promotes tumor development and even metastasis by increasing
  angiogenesis and the infiltration of other inhibitory immune cells. At the same
  time, γδT cells express high levels of immune checkpoint ligands and inhibit other
  immune effector cells, such as αβT cells, by binding to immune checkpoint receptors
  on their surface. In addition, CD39/CD73, as the rate-limiting enzyme of the adenosine
  pathway, can promote the accumulation of adenosine in the TME by acting with soluble
  molecules such as TGF-β and the sBTN proteins. These interactions generate an immunosuppressive
  network by inhibiting effector cells, including but not limited to γδT cells, αβT
  cells and NK cells, through adenosine receptors, which further reduces the antitumor
  effects of γδT cells
