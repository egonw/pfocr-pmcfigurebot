caption: Effects of sleep deprivation on the transcriptome of the prefrontal cortex
  in mice. (A) Volcano map (a) and scatter map (b) showed differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs) in the prefrontal cortex of SD vs. CC mice (n = 4). (B) DEGs disease
  annotation analysis in the prefrontal cortex of SD vs. CC mice. (C) Top 50 DEGs
  in the prefrontal cortex of SD vs. CC mice. (D) KEGG-based enrichment analysis of
  the top 50 DEGs in the prefrontal cortex of SD vs. CC mice. (E) GO-based Biological
  Process analysis of the top 50 DEGs. (F) GO-based Molecular Function analysis of
  the top 50 DEGs.
