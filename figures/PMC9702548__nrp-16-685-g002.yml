figure_title: Effect of PGE and HFPGE on the phagocytic activity in RAW 264.7 cells.
  Cells were seeded at density of 1 × 105 cells/well in a 96-well plate and incubated.
  After 24 h, cells were treated with varying concentrations of PGE (A) and HFPGE
  (B), and incubated for 24 h. The phagocytic activity was measured using the Phagocytosis
  assay (zymosan substrate) kit. Each bar expresses the mean ± SEM (n = 6). Means
  without the same letter differ, P < 0.05
caption: PGE, Platycodon grandiflorum extract; HFPGE, hydrolyzed and fermented Platycodon
  grandiflorum extract; LPS, 0.1 μg/mL lipopolysaccharide.
article_title: Immunostimulatory activity of hydrolyzed and fermented Platycodon grandiflorum
  extract occurs via the MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathway in RAW 264.7 cells.
