caption: 'Hypoxia/ischemia/stroke can cause vascular endothelia injury which can lead
  to production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-1β, and free radicals.
  This phenomenon causes activation of NF-kβ, which leads to activation of MMP-9.
  In a second pathway, hypoxia/ischemia/stroke can cause activation of PAR-1, t-PA
  and LRP, activating the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, which in turn activates
  furin, leading to MMP3 activation. In a third pathway, hypoxia/ischemia/stroke activates
  furin via activation of HIF-α, and furin triggers the activation of MMP14; active
  MMP14 causes activation of MMP2, and TIMP regulates MMP2 activity. In addition to
  these pathways that activate MMP-2, MMP-3 and MMP-9, other components such as microglia,
  macrophage and infiltrating neutrophils activate MMP-9, all of which lead to disruption
  of the extracellular matrix. Disruption of the extracellular matrix can lead to
  BBB disruption, which initiates neural degeneration. Abbreviations: TNF-α, tumor
  necrosis factor-alpha; IL-1β, interleukin-1 beta; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa B;
  PAR, protease activated receptor 1; t-PA, tissue plasminogen activator; LRP, lipoprotein
  receptor-related protein; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; HIF, hypoxia-inducible
  factor; TIMP, tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase; BBB, blood brain barrier'
