caption: A summary model of the generation of anterior placodes from hPSCs using the
  dSMADi-based procedures. The diagram illustrates multiple cell fate decisions of
  the pluripotent stem cells, including those following Noggin- and SB431542-mediated
  phase of inhibition and TGF-β, Activin, and Nodal signaling inhibition []. Formation
  of anterior pre-placodal cell fate commitment can be subsequently induced through
  BMP activation. In contrast, epidermal precursors can be generated through surface
  ectoderm induction mediated by FGF inhibition. The anterior pre-placodal cells can
  generate anterior pituitary placodal cells through activation of SHH signaling to
  produce gonadotrops at day 30 of the cultures []. Note that these cells treated
  subsequently by FGF8, BMP2, and both factors together generate hormone-producing
  cells analyzed at day 60 []. The olfactory placodal cell fate pathway analysis was
  limited to identification of a few cell markers, SIX1, DLX5, and FOXG1, and is marked
  (?) accordingly. Addition of BMP4 between days 7 and 11 increased the expression
  of lens lineage-specific transcription factors PAX6 and PITX3. Lens placodal cells
  were enriched through inhibition of FGF signaling by SU5402 at day 7, followed by
  analyses of lens placode markers PAX6, SIX3, and PITX3 and subsequent formation
  of αB-crystallin-expressing cells analyzed at day 57 [].
