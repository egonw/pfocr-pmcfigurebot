figure_title: Social deficits in VPA-exposed mice
caption: 'a Schematic diagram of the 3-chamber social behavior test. The social preference
  and recognition of vehicle (control)- or VPA-exposed mice were evaluated. b Left:
  in the social preference test, VPA-exposed mice did not show a significant preference
  for a novel conspecific (M) over an empty cup (E), while control mice showed a significant
  preference for the novel conspecific (n = 19 mice for control, n = 20 mice for VPA,
  two-way ANOVA: VPA, F1, 74 = 2.290e−014, P > 0.9999; target, F1, 74 = 54.32, ****P < 0.0001;
  interaction, F1, 74 = 38.2, ****P < 0.0001; Sidak’s multiple comparisons test: control,
  mouse versus object t74 = 9.461, ****P < 0.0001; VPA, mouse versus object t74 = 0.8525,
  P = 0.6360). Right: preference index (PI) of control and VPA-exposed mice. VPA-exposed
  mice showed significantly lower PI values than control mice (n = 19 for control,
  n = 20 for VPA, two-tailed unpaired t test; t37 = 4.37, ****P < 0.0001). c Representative
  heatmap images of the social preference test of control (upper) and VPA-exposed
  mice (lower). d Left: in the social recognition test, VPA-exposed mice did not show
  a significant preference for a novel conspecific (N) versus a familiar conspecific
  (F), while control mice showed a significant preference for the novel conspecific
  (n = 19 mice for control, n = 20 mice for VPA, two-way ANOVA: VPA, F1, 74 = 0.000,
  P > 0.9999; target, F1, 74 = 33.36, ****P < 0.0001; interaction, F1, 74 = 24.82,
  ****P < 0.0001; Sidak’s multiple comparisons test: control, novel versus familiar
  t74 = 7.511, ****P < 0.0001; VPA, novel versus familiar t74 = 0.5683, P = 0.8164).
  Right: PI of control and VPA-exposed mice. VPA-exposed mice showed significantly
  lower PI values than control mice (n = 19 for control, n = 20 for VPA, two-tailed
  unpaired t test; t37 = 4.523, **P = 0.0012). e Representative heatmap images of
  the social recognition test of control mice (upper) and VPA-exposed mice (lower).'
