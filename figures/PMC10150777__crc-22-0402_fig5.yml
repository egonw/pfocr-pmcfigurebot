caption: Differential regulation of WNT signaling and LEF1 in LFS. A, Probes in the
  WNT signaling pathway (WNT4, SMAD3, SFRP4, SERPINF) significantly associated with
  cancer status. B, Probe in the body of LEF1 (cg03041109) associated with cancer
  status (FDR = 0.07). C, Methylation of probe in body of LEF1 (cg03041109) across
  members within each LFS family. Probands almost unanimously have higher LEF1 methylation
  than their unaffected family members. D, Plasma cfDNA methylation of the body of
  LEF1 (chr4:109056901-109057200), between patients with LFS and HBCs. E, Tumor methylation
  of the body of LEF1 (cg03041109) in CPTs, with and without a germline variant in
  TP53.
