caption: Mechanism of ferroptosis and autophagy. Above is the regulatory pathway of
  iron death. Intracellular iron overload leads to the accumulation of ROS, which
  in turn peroxides polyunsaturated fatty acids on the cell membrane and damages the
  cell membrane. The Xc‐system of cell membrane can transport cystine into the cell
  to synthesize GSH, and under the catalysis of GPX4, it can remove ROS from the cell
  and reduce the peroxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids. These two systems are antagonistic
  to each other and jointly regulate iron death. Below is the regulation pathway of
  autophagy. Cells sense ATP/AMP signals in the surrounding environment, activate
  downstream signal transduction through mTOR and AMPK related signal molecules and
  induce the formation of autophagy. Then autophagy combines with lysosomes to degrade
  the internal substances and release nutrients for cell recycling.
