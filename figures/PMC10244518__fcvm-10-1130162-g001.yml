caption: RNA sequencing shows Lp(a) induces inflammatory response in THP-1 macrophages.
  THP-1 macrophages were starved in serum-free complete medium for 16 h, followed
  by replacing of the medium with fresh serum-free medium supplemented with equimolar
  concentrations of Lp(a) and 17 K apo(a) (250 nmol/L, or 191 and 62.5 µg/ml protein,
  respectively), or no supplement for 6 h. RNA was extracted, and RNA sequencing was
  performed. The dataset was filtered to contain only genes which have a fold change
  of at least 2 compared to controls and an Anova score of p ≤ 0.05. (A) The datasets
  for differentially expressed genes of Lp(a) and apo(a) overlapped by 246 genes.
  (B) For treatment with Lp(a), 2003 genes were expressed differentially, with 659
  upregulated and 1,344 downregulated genes. (C) Treatment with apo(a) lead to the
  differential expression of 392 genes of which 253 were upregulated and 193 downregulated.
  (D) The top 10 most downregulated genes for Lp(a) were [protein-encoding genes ZBED9
  (Zinc Finger BED-Type Containing 9) and P2RY11 (Purinergic Receptor P2Y11), RNA-encoding
  SNORA86 (Small Nucleolar RNA, H/ACA Box 86), protein-encoding genes DLX3 (Distal-Less
  Homeobox 3), ZNF280A (Zinc Finger Protein 280A), and TSGA10IP (Testis Specific 10
  Interacting Protein), long non-coding RNA gene LOC101929748 (Uncharacterized LOC101929748),
  protein-encoding genes AGAP5 (ArfGAP With GTPase Domain, Ankyrin Repeat And PH Domain
  5), and XKR5 (XK Related 5), and long non-coding RNA gene LOC105370401 (Uncharacterized
  LOC105370401). The 10 most upregulated genes are protein-encoding GPR31 (G Protein-Coupled
  Receptor 31), SELE (Selectin E), IL27 (Interleukin 27), APOBEC3A (Apolipoprotein
  B MRNA Editing Enzyme Catalytic Subunit 3A), SPDYE5 (Speedy/RINGO Cell Cycle Regulator
  Family Member E5), IFIT1B (Interferon Induced Protein With Tetratricopeptide Repeats
  1B), IFNB1 (Interferon Beta 1), ACOD1 (Aconitate Decarboxylase 1), IDO1 (Indoleamine
  2,3-Dioxygenase 1), and IL6 (Interleukin 6). (E) For apo(a) the most upregulated
  genes were protein-encoding SELE (Selectin E), SPDYE5 (Speedy/RINGO Cell Cycle Regulator
  Family Member E5), TMPRSS2 (Transmembrane Serine Protease 2), EXOC3L4 (Exocyst Complex
  Component 3 Like 4), KCNB2 (Potassium Voltage-Gated Channel Subfamily B Member 2),
  GPR37L1 (G Protein-Coupled Receptor 37 Like 1), OLFM2 (Olfactomedin 2), CSF3 (Colony
  Stimulating Factor 3), IL6 (Interleukin-6), and CYP3A5 (Cytochrome P450 Family 3
  Subfamily A Member 5). The 10 most downregulated genes were RNA-encoding genes SNORA86
  (Small Nucleolar RNA, H/ACA Box 86), and CHKB-CPT1B [CHKB-CPT1B Readthrough (NMD
  Candidate)], protein-encoding gene LGALS9B (Galectin 9B), long non-coding RNA gene
  LOC105370401 (Uncharacterized LOC105370401), protein-encoding genes DMBX1 (Diencephalon/Mesencephalon
  Homeobox 1), and RDH12 (Retinol Dehydrogenase 12), and long non-coding genes LINC01220
  (Long Intergenic Non-Protein Coding RNA 1220), LINC01802 (Long Intergenic Non-Protein
  Coding RNA 1802), and LINC02099 (Long Intergenic Non-Protein Coding RNA 2099), and
  pseudogene LOC100129138 (THAP Domain Containing 3 Pseudogene). The up- and downregulation
  of the genes are expressed as fold change between Lp(a) or apo(a) and control. (F)
  String protein-protein interaction network for the 659 upregulated genes after stimulation
  with Lp(a) in the RNAseq experiment. The blue cluster comprises proteins belonging
  to the reactome pathway “Interferon alpha/beta signaling” (R-HSA-909733) and the
  red clusters belong to “Interleukin-10 signaling” (R-HSA-6783783).
