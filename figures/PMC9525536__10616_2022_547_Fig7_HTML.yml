caption: 'Effect of different concentratins of PD98059 on HL-60 cells’ differentiation
  and activation of ERK1/2. A Cells treated with 2.5 µM, 5 µM and 7.5 µM of PD98059,
  45 min before the addition of P3 fraction (20 µg/ml) were scored for NBT positive
  cells at 96 h post-treatment. Data represent the mean ± SD of three independent
  experiments. Statistical significance (p value) was calculated with respect to vehicle-reated
  HL-60 cells using Ordinary One-way ANOVA (Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test).
  #p ≤ 0.001. B Western blot analysis of ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2 and GAPDH levels in HL-60
  cells treated with 0.18% DMSO (VC), peak 3 fraction (P3) alone and P3-treated cells,
  pre-exposed to different concentrations of PD98059'
article_title: Anti-leukemic principle(s) from Momordica charantia seeds induce differentiation
