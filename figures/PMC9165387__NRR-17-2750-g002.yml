caption: Noise-induced cochlear trauma and hearing function changes.(A, B) Auditory
  brainstem response (ABR)-click thresholds (A) and ABR tone-burst thresholds (B)
  in the noise exposure (NE) and normal control (Ctrl) groups. (C) The distance from
  the apex of the cochlea to the hook process is 0–100% (apex = 0%, base = 100%).
  Cochleogram distribution of the missing outer hair cells between the two groups
  in the cochleae. (D) The number of missing outer hair cells (OHCs) per cochlea.
  (E) Substantial reduction in the number of spiral ganglion cells (SGCs) caused by
  noise exposure. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, vs. ctrl group (Student’s t-test). n = 10
  in each group in A and B, n = 5 in each group in C–E, where n denotes the number
  of cochleae. All experiments were repeated six times.
