caption: 'The RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR signalings are key RAS effector pathways.
  The RAS signaling, which is involved among other things in cell proliferation, apoptosis,
  migration, fate specification, and differentiation, is the prototypical kinase signaling
  pathway that starts with the binding of the growth factor such as EGF to its parent
  receptor, which is a receptor tyrosine kinase located in the cellular membrane.
  EGFR dimerizes, activates, and recruits SOS, a GEF factor, to its phosphorylated
  C-terminus through GRB2 and SHC. GEF catalyzes the GDP/GTP exchange, which in turn
  activates RAS. The activated GTP-bound RAS dimer associates with RAF, promoting
  its dimerization and subsequent activation. The phosphorylated RAF activates MEK1/2
  followed by ERK1/2 activation. One of the targets of ERK1/2 is the transcription
  factor ELK1, which is phosphorylated as well. Activated ELK1 recruits its cofactor,
  a dimer of SRF, leading to the upregulation of target genes that direct cellular
  proliferation. The second pathway that is activated involves PI3K, which phosphorylates
  PIP2 to PIP3. This reaction may be reversed by PTEN. PIP3 subsequently interacts
  with PDK1, which phosphorylates AKT, a serine-threonine kinase and then finally
  the mTORC1 complex is assembled, which regulates cell growth. Alternatively, PIP3
  influences the assembly of the mTOR2, which phosphorylates AKT. Abbreviations: EGFR,
  epidermal growth factor receptor; SOS, son of sevenless; GEF, guanine nucleotide
  exchange factor; SHC, SH2-adaptor protein; GRB2, growth factor receptor-bound protein
  2; MEK1/2, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 and 2; SRF, serum response
  factor; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate;
  PIP3, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homologue;
  PDK1, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin;
  MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase.'
