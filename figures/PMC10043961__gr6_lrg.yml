caption: Atovaquone does not target pyrimidine synthesis pathway Vero E6 cells at
  1 and 5 µM. (A) Metabolomic analyses for of Vero E6 cells treated with DMSO or Atovaquone,
  at, showing no change in the uridine monophosphate (UMP) levels at 1 and 5 µM, and
  significant depletion in UMP levels at 10 µM. (B) Molecular pathway of de novo pyrimidine
  synthesis. (C) Levels of UMP with respect to orotate and dihydroorotate levels in
  Vero E6 cells treated with 1, 5, and 10 µM atovaquone, showing only depletion in
  the UMP levels at 10 µM ATO. (D)SARS-CoV-2 replication in the presence of 5 µM and
  100 µM uridine treated with 1.5, 5, and 10 µM atovaquone or 5 µM vidofludimus (potent
  DHODH inhibitor). Atovaquone showed significant inhibition for viral replication
  regardless the uridine concentration, however vidofludimus activity changed based
  on the uridine addition. Data represent average of biological triplicates. Error
  bars, SEM.
