caption: Compound-genomics target drug prediction and functional analysis. (a) Prediction
  of compound targeting FFAR1 was analyzed by PubChem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).
  (b) Target prediction of candesartan was analyzed by SwissTargetPrediction (http://www.swisstargetprediction.ch/),
  and the top 25 targets were classified to obtain the target class pie chart. (c)
  Then, Venn analysis (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/) of the compound
  targets (100 genes) with profile 22 (359 genes) was performed. (d) The correlation
  between gene expression and time of the intersection genes was analyzed by Venn
  analysis. (e) Bar graph of enriched terms across input gene lists by Metascape (https://metascape.org/gp/index.html#/main/step1).
  (f) Network of enriched terms. (g, h) Protein-protein interaction network and MCODE
  components were identified in the gene lists. (i) Enrichment analysis of the input
  gene was listed by Enrichr (https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/).
