caption: Venn diagram of differentially expressed miRNAs between different comparisons
  of tolerant (Swarnaprabha (S)) and susceptible (IR8 (I)) rice genotypes. The sum
  of numbers in each circle represents a total number of differentially expressed
  miRNAs within a group, while overlap represents the miRNAs expressed commonly in
  between comparisons. (a) Distribution of differentially expressed miRNA between
  ST1, ST3, and ST5 with respect to control (b) Distribution of differentially expressed
  miRNA between IT1, IT3, and IT5 with respect to control (c) Distribution of differentially
  expressed miRNA between SC, ST1, ST3, ST5 and IC, IT1, IT3, IT5. IC-IR8 control
  (untreated); IT1-IR8 for 1 day low-light-treated; IT3-IR8 for 3 days low-light-treated;
  IT5-IR8 for 5 days low-light-treated; SC—Swarnaprabha control (untreated); ST1—Swarnaprabha
  for 1 day low-light-treated; ST3—Swarnaprabha for 3 days low-light-treated; ST5—Swarnaprabha
  for 5 days low-light-treated.
