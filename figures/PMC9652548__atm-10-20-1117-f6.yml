caption: ROR2 activated the non-canonical Wnt pathway but not the canonical Wnt pathway.
  (A,B) Western blot of canonical Wnt pathway proteins and non-canonical Wnt pathway
  proteins in AGS, SNU601 (A), SGC7901, and MGC803 (B) cells stably expressing ectopic
  ROR2 and the control vectors. (C) Western blot of JNK1/2 and p-JNK1/2 in nucleus
  proteins and cytoplasm proteins, respectively, from AGS-ROR2 WT and AGS-Con cells.
  ROR2 WT and Con, ROR2-overexpressing (WT) and the empty vector plasmids (Con); shROR2
  and NC, short hairpin (shRNA) targeting ROR2 (shROR2) and the empty vector plasmids
  (NC).
