caption: IL-8 inhibited the proliferation of T cells through the STAT3 signaling pathway.
  (A,B) Flow cytometry analysis for cell apoptosis of Jurkat T cells stimulated with
  human recombinant IL-8 proteins (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 μg/mL). (C,D) Flow cytometry
  analysis for the expression of Ki67 in Jurkat T cells stimulated with human recombinant
  IL-8 proteins (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 μg/mL). (E) Inhibition rate of Jurkat T
  cells stimulated with human recombinant IL-8 proteins (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8
  μg/mL) determined by CCK-8 assay. (F,G) Western blot analysis for p-STAT3 levels
  in CAL27 cells without treatment, Jurkat T cells without treatment, Jurkat T cells
  co-cultured with CAL27 supernatant, and Jurkat T cells co-cultured with CAL27 supernatant
  and 0.5 μg/mL anti-IL-8 neutralizing antibody treatment. (H,I) Western blot analysis
  for p-STAT3 levels in Jurkat T cells without treatment, Jurkat T cells co-cultured
  with CAL27 supernatant, and Jurkat T cells co-cultured with CAL27 supernatant and
  100 ng/mL reparixin (inhibitor of the IL-8 receptors CXCR1/2). (J,K) Flow cytometry
  analysis for p-STAT3 expression levels in Jurkat T cells without treatment and Jurkat
  T cells stimulated with 0.8 μg/mL recombinant human IL-8 proteins. (L,M) Flow cytometry
  analysis for p-STAT3 expression levels in Jurkat T cells without treatment, Jurkat
  T cells stimulated with 0.8 μg/mL recombinant human IL-8 proteins, and Jurkat T
  cells stimulated with 0.8 μg/mL recombinant human IL-8 proteins and 6 μmol/L stattic
  (inhibitor of STAT3). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001. Here, NC is negative
  control.
