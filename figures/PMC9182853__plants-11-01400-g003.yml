caption: Light promotes root growth and nutrient absorption. (a) CYP1 is a phloem
  mobile protein that regulates shoot-to-root homeostasis. Light intensity determines
  the expression level of CYP1 in source leaves. Shoot-derived CYP1 protein accumulates
  in the roots, leading to activation of the auxin responses, thereby enhancing lateral
  root formation. Phloem-mediated systemic regulation, through this CYP1 pathway,
  is also involved in xylem development, which is critical for transport of H2O and
  mineral nutrients from roots to shoots. (b) Arabidopsis ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5),
  a key positive regulator of light signaling, is a phloem mobile transcription factor
  that traffics from shoot to root. In the aboveground tissue, HY5 binds to the promoters
  of TPS1, SWEET11, and SWEET12 to regulate carbon fixation and phloem-mediated transport
  of photoassimilates. Mobile HY5, derived from shoots, binds the promoter regions
  of HY5 and NRT2.1 genes in the root to promote root growth and nitrate uptake. Both
  shoot-derived CYP1 and HY5 can lead to enhanced root activity to improve shoot growth.
  These long-distance signaling agents also contribute to balancing the plantâ€™s shoot-to-root
  ratio. Red darts indicate up-regulation of described responses.
