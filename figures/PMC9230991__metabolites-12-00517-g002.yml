caption: '(A) The distribution of ornithine, arginine, and dimethylarginine in CHD
  patients and controls. (B) The impact of sex on ornithine, arginine, and dimethylarginine
  distribution. (C) The impact of type 2 diabetes on ornithine, arginine, and dimethylarginine
  distribution. (D) The arginine biosynthesis pathway (KEGG pathway: hsa00220). (E)
  The arginine and ornithine metabolism pathway (KEGG pathway: hsa00472). (F) The
  role of increased concentrations of ADMA in the metabolism of L-arginine. (G) The
  DDAH/ADMA pathway and the role of increased concentrations of ADMA in vascular function
  and homeostasis. Colored metabolites were found in our metabolomic profile. Metabolites
  in red, yellow, and green have lower, the same, and higher concentration in cases
  compared with controls, respectively.'
