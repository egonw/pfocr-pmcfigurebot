caption: AR pathway in hormone-dependent prostate cancer cells. Under normal physiological
  conditions, the synthesis of androgens takes place in the Leydig cells of the testicles
  and in the zona reticularis of the adrenal gland. Testosterone, the prototypical
  androgenic steroid hormone, circulates in the bloodstream, bound to sex hormone-binding
  globulin (SHBG) or as free testosterone. Upon reaching the prostate cell, testosterone
  dissociates from SHBG and transverses the cellular membrane via diffusion. The enzymatic
  conversion of testosterone to DHT is mediated by 5a-reductase. Following binding
  with DHT, the androgen receptor (AR) dissociates from the heat shock protein (HSP).
  The DHT-AR complex undergoes conformational changes and is translocated within the
  nucleus, where it dimerizes. p300 acts as histone acetyltransferase (HAT) promoting
  the formation of euchromatin, which facilitates the binding of the DHT-AR dimer
  to the androgen-responsive elements (ARE) in the promoter region of the TMPRSS2
  gene. In addition, p300 functions as a co-activator, enhancing gene transcription
  and resulting in the overexpression of the ERG oncogene. Created with BioRender.com.
