caption: Pathway enrichment in the aggressive NAT10-relevant PDAC subtype. (A) Heatmap
  showing significantly and uniquely upregulated Hallmark pathways in each of the
  three NAT10-relevant PDAC subtypes; the input was the GSVA enrichment score of the
  specific pathway in specific subtype. (B) GSEA plot for immune-related and cell
  cycle-related pathways in the aggressive C3 subtype of PDAC in TCGA cohort.
