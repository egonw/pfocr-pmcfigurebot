caption: Expression of miR-874, PMVK, and SREBF2 in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
  database analysis and meta-analysis. (a) Expression of miR-874 (left), PMVK (middle),
  and SREBF-2 (right) in breast cancer tissues compared with normal tumour-adjacent
  tissues in the TCGA breast cancer dataset (normal samples [n = 104] versus tumour
  samples [n = 1093]). The data are presented as logarithmic values. The central line
  represents the median gene expression. Outliers above the 95th percentile and below
  the 5th percentile are displayed as dot plots. (b) Correlation analysis between
  the expression of miR-874 and PMVK (Pearson’s r =  − 0.255, p < 0.0001). (c) Cohort
  studies for PMVK gene expression in a breast cancer meta-analysis were combined
  using random-effects models. The integrated hazard ratios (HRs) of relapse-free
  survival and its 95% confidence interval are shown. All cohorts were divided by
  the median gene expression ratio. Source data are provided in Supplementary Table
  S3. (d) Overall survival for the high and low PMVK mRNA expression groups (upper
  panel) and PMVK protein expression groups (lower panel) depicted using Kaplan–Meier
  plotter (https://kmplot.com/analysis). (e) A schematic view of a proposed mechanism
  through which miR-874 induces cancer cell death via suppression of the mevalonate
  pathway. miR-874 suppresses the mevalonate pathway by directly targeting PMVK and
  SREBF2, resulting in GGPP depletion, which activates the c-Myc and p53 signalling
  pathways and causes apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.
