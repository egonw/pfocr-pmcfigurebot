figure_title: Non-exhaustive scheme of lipid exchanges between tumor cells and tumor
  microenvironment (TME) cells and lipid reprogramming of stromal cells, that activate
  their pro-tumoral features
caption: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) take up free fatty acid (FFAs), produce
  various lipids and together with cancer-associated adipocytes (CAAs) produce extracellular
  vesicles (EVs) that reach tumor cells to supply them with metabolic intermediates
  and enzymatic arsenal to activate metabolic pathways, such as fatty acid oxidation
  (FAO). CAAs are the seat of activated lipolysis, and the resulting FFAs once released
  in the TME can be taken up by tumoral cells. In tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs),
  the decreased in lipid rafts domains, resulting from increased cholesterol efflux,
  participate to TAMs activation. In these cells, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis
  is also activated and contribute to the generation of an immunosuppressive tumor
  microenvironment. This latter is also promoted by myeloid-derived-suppressor cells
  (MDSCs), through the activation of FFA uptake and degradation and of the PGE2-PGE2
  receptor 2 subtype (EP2) signaling pathway. Tumor cells are the recipients of various
  lipid species released in the TME by TME cells and are the mediators of an immunosuppressive
  TME via their release of lipids and cytokines. TAG triacylglycerides, TCA tricarboxylic
