figure_title: Clock-controlled pathways in Arabidopsis and the hexaploid wheat are
  largely conserved
caption: Following the divergence of monocots and dicots over 140 million years ago
  (MYA), the ancestors of bread wheat evolved. Interspecific hybridization between
  the tetraploid (AABB) and diploid (DD) ancestors gave rise to the hexaploid (AABBDD)
  bread wheat we eat today. Comparisons of clock regulation of gene expression with
  Arabidopsis highlight examples of conservation and divergence in clock control of
  critical biological pathways. The temporal patterns of expression for circadian
  clock and light signaling genes are largely conserved, although clock genes retained
  in 3 copies often varied in amplitude across the subgenomes and had a 3.5-h longer
  mean period than Arabidopsis. Starch metabolism has diversified in terms of clock
  control of transcript abundance for genes within the pathway suggesting altered
  regulation of this process. Created with BioRender.com.
