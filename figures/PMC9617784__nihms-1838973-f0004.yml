figure_title: Defective activation of Syk-deficient microglia in 5xFAD mice
caption: 5xFAD Sykfl/flCx3cr1ERT2Cre (5xFAD SykΔMG mice), Cre-negative 5xFAD Sykfl/fl
  littermate controls (5xFAD mice), Sykfl/flCx3cr1ERT2Cre (SykΔMG mice), and Cre-negative
  Sykfl/fl littermate controls (Sykcon mice) received tamoxifen food for 2 weeks starting
  at 3 weeks of age and then mice were returned to regular food for the remainder
  of the experiment. Brains were later harvested at 5 months of age to evaluate microglial
  activation.(A) Imaris-rendered microglia morphology labeled with Iba1 (blue) in
  the cortex.(B) Sholl analysis quantification from a total of 12 microglia from 3
  matching brain sections per mouse (5xFAD n = 9, 5xFAD SykΔMG n = 8).(C–F) Bulk RNA-seq
  performed on CD11b+-magnetic bead sorted microglia from 5-month-old mice. (C) Principal
  component (PC) analysis of sample clustering.(D) Volcano plots depicting differentially
  expressed genes (FDR < 0.1). (E) KEGG term enrichment scatterplot highlighting major
  pathways that are repressed in 5xFAD SykΔMG microglia in comparison to 5xFAD microglia.
  (F) Heatmap representation of significantly downregulated (FDR < 0.1) stage 1 and
  2 disease-associated microglia (DAM) genes between 5xFAD SykΔMG and 5xFAD groups.(G
  and H) Mouse AKT pathway phosphorylation array conducted on microglia from 5-month-old
  5xFAD SykΔMG and 5xFAD mice. (G) Representative membranes incubated with 5xFAD and
  5xFAD SykΔMG microglia measuring AKT phosphorylation targets. (H) Quantification
  of dot pixel density normalized with respective positive and negative control sample
  dot pixel density. Data are plotted in membrane order of phosphorylated protein
  probes; n of 3 for each group.Statistical significance between experimental groups
  was calculated by a two-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni post-hoc test (B) and an unpaired
  Student’s t test (H). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ****p < 0.0001. Error bars represent
  mean ± SEM.See also .
