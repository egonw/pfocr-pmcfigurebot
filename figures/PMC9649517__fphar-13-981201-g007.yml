  (A) Relationship between scale-free topological model fit and soft threshold (power)
  in the GSE62254 database. (B) Relationship between average connectivity and various
  soft thresholds in the GSE62254 database. (C) Dendrogram of modules identified by
  WGCNA. (D) The top ten genes most associated with FNDC5 expression in GSE62254.
