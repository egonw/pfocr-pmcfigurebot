caption: 'AZD1775 triggers UPR in mtTP53 ovarian cancer cells. A) Hallmark pathway
  enriched by GSEA. OVCAR8 cells were treated with DMSO or 400 × 10−9m AZD1775 for
  48 h and subjected to RNA‐seq analysis. B) GSEA plot of the Hallmark pathway UNFOLDED
  PROTEIN RESPONSE enriched by AZD1775 treatment. C) Representative images by electron
  microscopy of the ER (indicated by the orange arrows). The cells were treated with
  DMSO or 400 × 10−9m AZD1775 for 48 h. Scale bar, 1.0 µm. D) Quantification of the
  percentage of cells with expanded volume or increased number of ER in (C). Error
  bars represent the standard deviation (SD) of the mean (n = 3), **p < 0.01, ***p
  < 0.001, ns, not significant, as determined by the unpaired two‐tailed Student''s
  t‐test. E) Representative images and quantification of aggregated protein levels.
  Cells were treated with DMSO or 400 × 10−9m AZD1775 for 48 h and protein aggregates
  were detected using the Proteostat Dye. Error bars represent the SD of the mean
  (n = 3), **p < 0.01, ns, not significant, as determined by the unpaired two‐tailed
  Student''s t‐test. Scale bar, 20 µm. F) Western blot analysis of the protein expression
  levels of the key proteins in the UPR. Ovarian cancer cell lines were treated with
  or without 400 × 10−9m AZD1775 for 72 h. The data represent three independent experiments.
  The numbers represent the mean quantification (n = 3) of the gray scale using image
  Lab software 6.0.1. after normalizing to GAPDH, *p < 0.05, as determined by the
  unpaired two‐tailed Student''s t‐test. G) Western blot analysis of the protein expression
  levels of PERK, p‐PERK, IRE1α, p‐IRE1α. A2780 cells were treated with or without
  400 × 10−9m AZD1775 for 72 h after transfected with scramble siRNA (NC) or TP53
  siRNA. #2 and #3 denote different TP53 siRNAs. H) Representative images and quantification
  of aggregated proteins. A2780‐TP53 ko@9 clone cells were treated with DMSO or 400 ×
  10−9m AZD1775 for 48 h and stained with Proteostat Dye. The data represent three
  independent experiments. Scale bar, 20 µm. Error bars represent the SD of the mean
  (n = 3), ns, not significant, as determined by the unpaired two‐tailed Student''s
  t‐test. I) quantification of aggregated proteins in Figure  (Supporting information).
  OVCAR8 cells were treated with or without 400 × 10−9m AZD1775 for 72 h after transfected
  with scramble siRNA (NC) or TP53 siRNAs. The data represent three independent experiments.
  Scale bar, 20 µm. Error bars represent the SD of the mean (n = 3), **p < 0.01, ns,
  not significant, as determined by the unpaired two‐tailed Student''s t‐test.'
