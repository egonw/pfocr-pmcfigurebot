caption: Multiple myeloma dysregulation of the RB pathway. Primary events (HRD, t(11;14),
  t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14; 20), and t(6;14) lead to the dysregulation of a D cyclin.
  Cyclin D1, cyclin D2, and cyclin D3 interact with CDK4 and CDK6 to phosphorylate
  RB, allowing the E2F family transcription factors to activate the G1-to-S phase
  transition in the cell cycle.
