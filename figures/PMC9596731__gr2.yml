caption: 'PDAC induced fat loss trigged hypothermia: A) Study design. KPC tumor cells
  (5 × 106) were implanted intraperitoneally into C57BL/6 mice (KPCi group, n = 5).
  The control mice were administered with PBS solution (PBS group, n = 5). B) Plasma
  levels of Lcn2 at day 8 post KPC tumor cell implantation or PBS administration in
  mice were measured by ELISA, n = 5. C) Immunoblot analysis of Lcn2 in inguinal white
  adipose tissue (iWAT) from control and KPCi mice, n = 5. D) Surface body temperature
  was measured using infrared camera at indicated time points, n = 5. E) Representative
  images of gross appearance of brown adipose tissue (BAT) (indicated by yellow dots)
  from control and KPCi mice are shown. F, G) Representative images of hematoxylin
  and eosin (H&E) (F) and Oil Red O (G) staining of BAT from day 4 and day 10 post
  KPC tumor cell implantation or PBS administration are shown. H, I) FACS analyses
  were used to identify immune cell populations gated out of total live cells isolated
  from BAT tissue on day 4 and day 10 post tumor cell implantation of indicated groups
  of mice. CD45+ cells (H) and CD11b + F4/80+ cells (I), n = 5. J) Top-ranking pathways
  identified by PGSEA on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) using IDEPv905.
  Significance cutoff of FDR <0.5 and differential pathways are listed according to
  adjusted p value. Pathways activated are shown in red, and suppressed pathways are
  shown in blue. K) Volcano plot of gene expression of up-regulated (purple) and down-regulated
  (green) genes in BAT from KPCi mice compared with WT mice using ShinyGo 0.76. Selected
  genes are indicated. L) Heatmap of relative expression of selected thermogenesis-associated
  genes from the RNA-seq dataset. Genes with p < 0.05 are displayed. M) Thermogenesis
  pathway from KEGG. Genes significantly downregulated (red) and upregulated (green)
  in BAT during tumor progression compared with BAT of control group. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01.
  For J–M: n = 2, gene set downregulated in KPCi mice by > 1.5 fold, FDR<0.05, p < 0.05
  compared with WT mice used for analysis.'
