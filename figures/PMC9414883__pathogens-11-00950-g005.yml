caption: Folate biosynthesis pathway in Leishmania donovani and targeting of LdPTR1
  enzyme with specific inhibitors. (A)—BT-1 (biopterin) and FT-1 (folate) enter in
  the parasitic cells through transporters. Thereafter, metabolic enzymes such asPTR1
  and DHFR-TS catalyze further steps and produce tetrahydrobiopterin and tetrahydrofolate,
  respectively. (B)—PTR-1 protein interacts with various inhibitors through the indicated
  amino acids, primarily involving H-bonds and π-π interactions (created with BioRender.com).
