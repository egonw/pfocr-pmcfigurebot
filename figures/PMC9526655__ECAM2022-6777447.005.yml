caption: 'TSD promotes the expression levels of osteogenic protein. (a) Quantitative
  analysis of ALP, Runx2, and OPN-1 mRNA level. (b) The protein expression levels
  of quantitative analysis ALP, Runx2, and OPN-1 were analyzed by western blot. ns:
  no statistical significance; ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. the control serum group. ###P < 0.001
  vs. the TSD group. TSD: Taohong Siwu decoction; ALP: alkaline phosphatase; Runx2:
  runt-related transcription factor 2; and OPN-1: osteopontin-1.'
