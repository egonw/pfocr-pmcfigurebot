caption: DSF upregulated cGAS-STING pathway through inhibiting PARP1 activity. The
  protein levels of PARP1 in PANC-1 (A) and BXPC-3 (B) cells treated with different
  doses of DSF were determined by western blot. (C) Total PARylation in PANC-1 cells
  treated with different doses of DSF was examined to evaluate the activity of PARP1.
  (D) Total PARylation in PANC-1 cells treated by DSF or chemotherapy was detected
  by western blot. (E) The mRNA levels of IFNα and IFNβ in wild type or PARP1 knockout
  PANC-1 cells treated by DSF or chemotherapy were determined by qRT-PCR. (F) PARP1
  protein levels in PANC-1 cells transfected with shNC or shRNA targeting cGAS. (G)
  Immunohistochemistry staining of the subcutaneous tumor tissues treated with DSF
  or chemotherapy (**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, NS indicates no significance).

  cancer treatment efficacy through the activation of cGAS-STING signaling pathway
  via suppressing PARP1 expression.
