caption: CB improved intestinal inflammation in AOM/DSS mice. (A) Effect of CB on
  body weight after grouping. Error bars represent mean ± SD; **P<0.01. (B) Statistical
  analysis of colon length. Error bars represent mean ± SEM; ns, no significant difference.
  (C) Representative histological appearance of gut inflammation in the 2 groups.
  The section of tissue was stained by hematoxylin and eosin. Scale bar, 50 µm. (D,E)
  Comparison of IL-6 (D) and IL-10 (E) in plasma. Error bars represent mean ± SD;
  **P<0.01. Ctrl, control group; CB, Clostridium butyricum; AOM/DSS, azoxymethane/dextran
  sulfate sodium salt.
