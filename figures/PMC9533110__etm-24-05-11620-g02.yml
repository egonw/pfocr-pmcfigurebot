caption: Chemerin upregulates the expression levels of mRNAs involved in the MAPK
  signaling pathway in RSC-364 synoviocytes. The expression levels of MAPK signaling
  pathway-related mRNAs were measured using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR
  and normalized to the expression of GAPDH in group N and group C. (A) Relative MEK,
  (B) ERK, (C) MMP-3 and (D) MMP-13 mRNA expression. *P<0.05 and ***P<0.001 vs. group
  N. CTRL, control; N, control synoviocytes, C, synoviocytes exposed to 0.5 Âµg/ml
  chemerin for 48 h.
article_title: Chemerin promotes MAPK/ERK activation to induce inflammatory factor
  production in rat synoviocytes.
