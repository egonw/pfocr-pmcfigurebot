caption: Functional enrichment of DEPs. (A) Functional classification chart of DEPs
  under three GO categories (biological process, cellular component, and molecular
  function). The yellow wavy line represented the number of proteins enriched to each
  function, and the bar chart represents the values of statistical p-values enriched
  by each function after LOG10 conversion. (B) The above 42 DEPs were included in
  KEGG pathways analysis; the horizontal axis represents the values of fold change
  by each pathway after LOG2 conversion, the colored scale bar represents the values
  of statistical p-values enriched by each function after LOG10 conversion, and the
  black circles represent the number of proteins enriched to each pathway. (C) The
  protein interaction network of DEPs. Protein-to-protein connections were shown in
  solid lines, and line thickness indicated the strength of data support. The medium
  confidence was 0.40.
