figure_title: Dietary restriction of methionine/cystine suppressed tumor progression
  in vivo
caption: 'A Experimental flow chart of the mice subcutaneous transplanted tumor model
  receiving dietary treatment intervention. A total of 10 mice randomly divided into
  two groups: methionine/cystine restriction (MCR) group (n = 5) and the control diet
  (CTR) group (n = 5). B–D After 31 days, tumors were harvested and general data on
  tumor were collected. The tumor images (B), tumor average diameter (C) and tumor
  volume (D) were analyzed and showed the tumor proliferation was blocked in MCR group
  when compared with CTR group. n = 5 for each group, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, two-tailed
  unpaired Student’s t test. E The Body weight of mice in MCR group and CTR group
  during dietary intervention. n = 5 for each group. F, G Luminescence scores of tumors
  in MCR and CTR groups at day 14 and day 31 (F). Representative images are shown
  (G). n = 5 for each group, **P < 0.01, two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test. H,
  I Weekly food consumption (H, n = 5 for each group), average daily water (I, n = 28
  for each group) intake of mice in MCR group and CTR group during dietary intervention.
  Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3).'
