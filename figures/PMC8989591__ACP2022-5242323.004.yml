caption: 'Expression of molecules related to TGF-β signaling pathway, antioxidants,
  inflammation-associated cytokines, and apoptosis-related molecules at 24 h after
  I/R injury in H9C2 cells. (a) The hydroxylamine method was used to detect SOD level.
  (b) The thiobarbituric acid method was used to detect MDA level. (c–e) Serum levels
  of CK, LDH, and AST were detected with corresponding ELISA kits. (f–h) Inflammation-related
  factors (IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6) were detected with corresponding ELISA kits. (i
  and j) Expression of BCL-2, Bax, and caspase-3 (Western blotting). Data are expressed
  as mean ± SD. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001, ALK4-NC+I/R group vs. ALK4-NC
  group. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, and ###P < 0.001, ALK4-KO+I/R group vs. ALK4-NC+I/R
  group.'
