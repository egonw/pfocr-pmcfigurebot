caption: Probiotic microcapsules alleviated inflammation by regulating the production
  of inflammatory cytokines and suppressing the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway.
  (A–C) The levels of IL-1β (A), IL-2 (B), and TNF-α (C) in the serum were measured.
  (D) Representative image of the expression levels of NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 detected
  by Western blotting. (E–G) Quantification of the NLRP3, n = 3 mice/group (E), caspase-1,
  n = 3 mice/group (F), and ASC, n = 3 mice/group (G). * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; ***
  p < 0.001.
