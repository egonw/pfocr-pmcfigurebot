caption: Biological therapeutic mechanisms of the ferroptosis-augmented SDT by RNA
  sequencing. (a) The heat map demonstrating co-expressed genes between the D-ZnO-PEG ​+ ​US
  group and the Control group. (b) The volcano map demonstrating the upregulated and
  downregulated genes by ferroptosis-augmented SDT. (c) Overall statistics of 1998
  differently expressed genes including 781 up-regulations and 1127 down-regulations.
  (d) Protein to protein interaction network of genes involved in the major signaling
  pathway. Histogram of different genes that all enriched in Kyoto Encyclopedia of
  Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway. (f) Histogram of main genes that are mainly related
  to ferroptosis and apoptosis in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway.
