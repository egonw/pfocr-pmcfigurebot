caption: 'Scheme of the pathway leading to formation of PNA aggregates in the cytoplasm.
  The PNA molecules (short green curves) are bound to both sides of each of the concentric
  lipid membranes composing the vesicles (see the right-upper corner). These multilamellar
  vesicles, characterized by large membrane surface area per volume, are capable of
  binding large amounts of membrane-bound PNA oligonucleotides. Internalization of
  the vesicles into the cell includes the following steps: 1—binding of a DARPin-PNA-SMV
  to HER2 receptors on the surface of the HER2-overexpressing cell and encapsulation
  of the liposome in the endosome; 2—maturation of the endosome to lysosome and digestion
  of the lysosome-entrapped liposome; 3—release of PNA monomers along with digested
  membrane fragments from the acidic lumen (pH 4.5–5) to neutral cytoplasm (pH~7.4),
  followed by aggregation of PNA monomers into large PNA aggregates.'
