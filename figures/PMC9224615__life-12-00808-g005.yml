caption: Pathway identification among A (T1 vs. T2), B (T1 vs. T3), and C (T1 vs.
  T4). The bubble charts show the enrichment of metabolites in the affected pathways
  (p < 0.05). The y-axis label provides the pathway names, and the x-axis label indicates
  the comparison group. Each circle represents a metabolic pathway, and the color
  and size of circle represent the results of metabolite enrichment and topology analysis,
  respectively.
