caption: (A) Polyamine synthesis pathway. ODC catalyzes the rate-limiting step of
  the conversion of ornithine to putrescine in the polyamine synthesis pathway. Putrescine
  acts as a substrate for the synthesis of spermidine which in turn acts a substrate
  for the synthesis of spermine.(B) MNK-3 cells were activated by IL-1Î² (n=4), IL-23
  (n=4) or left untreated (NT) (n=6) for 18 hours. Cells were harvested and subjected
  to targeted metabolomics analysis by HPLC-MS. Each point represents one well, bar
  indicates mean. Data presented are representative of two independent experiments.
  p<0.001 (***), p<0.0001 (****). Differences that were not significant (p>0.05) are
  marked as ns.
article_title: The polyamine putrescine is a positive regulator of group 3 innate
  lymphocyte (ILC3) activation.
