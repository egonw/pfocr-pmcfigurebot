caption: CDNF treatment regulates gene expression in the 6−OHDA−stimulated BV2 microglial
  cells. (A) Principal component analysis (PCA) of the transcriptomes among control,
  6−OHDA, and 6−OHDA + rhCDNF groups. (B) Volcano plot comparing the log2fold changes
  and adjusted p-values of 21,860 gene expressions. The red dots indicate genes significantly
  regulated (log2fold change >1 or <−1 adjusted p-value < 0.001), and the blue dots
  indicate genes with no significant change between 6−OHDA and 6−OHDA + rhCDNF. (C)
  GO biological processes overrepresentation analysis based on 253 DEGs. (D) Ingenuity®
  Bioinformatics pathway analysis revealed that highly canonical pathways were differentially
  expressed in PBS−treated and rhCDNF−treated BV2 cell lines in response to 6−OHDA
  stimulation. The canonical pathways included in this analysis are shown along the
  y-axis of the bar chart. The x−axis indicates the statistical significance. Calculated
  using the right-tailed Fisher exact test, the p−value indicates which biologic annotations
  are significantly associated with the input molecules relative to all functionally
  characterized mammalian molecules. (E) The activity of highly connected positive
  regulators of the inflammatory genes PI3KCG, PI3KCD, TLR2, and TLR8 led to the activation
  of this phagosome formation network, as assessed using the IPA molecule activity
  predictor in rhCDNF−treated BV2 cells after 24 h 6−OHDA stimulation.
