caption: Exosomal miR92a is upregulated in MDS/AML plasma. (A) Kaplan–Meier survival
  analysis of patients with pan cancer was conducted according to the expression of
  miR92a1/2 using the log-rank test via the TCGA database. (B) miR92a1/2 level in
  different types of cancer analysis by TCGA database. (C) The scheme of exosome isolation
  from plasma. (D) Detection of Exo markers by Western blotting. (E) Examination of
  Exo morphology by TEM. (F) Particle size of Exos by NTA. (G) Expression of exosomal
  miR92a in plasma derived from healthy donors (HD, n = 10) and MDS/AML patients (MDS/AML,
  n = 20). (H) The ratio of miR92a level in patient plasma to miR92a level in healthy
  donor plasma ≥ 2 was considered as high Exos-miR92a, and <2 was considered as low
  Exos-miR92a. miR92a level in SKM1 treated by Exos-HD, Exos-miR92a high and Exos-miR92a
  low. (I) Apoptosis of SKM1 treated by 2 μM Ara-C and 10 μg Exos-HD, high Exos-miR92a
  and low Exos-miR92a for 48 h analyzed by flow cytometry. Ns ≥ 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001.
