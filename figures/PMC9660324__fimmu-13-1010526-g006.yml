caption: Mannitol promotes glycolysis and the pyruvate cycle. (A) Mannitol metabolism
  pathway. (B) Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) for the
  quantification of gene expression of glycolysis and P cycle. (C, D) Activity of
  pyruvate kinase and pyruvate dehydrogenase in the presence of mannitol or/and serum.
  (E) Effects of mannitol or/and serum on the content of NADH. (F) Membrane potential
  of Vibrio alginolyticus treated with 100 μl serum for 2 h in the presence or absence
  of 5 mM mannitol. The results are displayed as means ± SEM, and significant differences
  are identified (*p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01) as determined by Student’s t-test. At
  least three biological repeats were carried out.
