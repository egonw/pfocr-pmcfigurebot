caption: 'CRISPR-CAS9 SAM screening of driver genes for chemoresistance in high-SIIS
  groups. (A) Experimental outline of screening and analysis. (B) Optical microscopic
  images of SW480 cells treated with oxaliplatin (0 μg/mL, 40 μg/mL) and 5FU (0 μg/mL,
  2 μg/mL) for 96 h. (C) Volcano plots to compare differences in sgRNA abundance between
  oxaliplatin- and DMSO-treated cells (upper) and between 5-FU- and DMSO-treated cells
  (bottom); (D-E) Heatmap showing the counts of sgRNA-representing genes that mediating
  oxaliplatin (D) and 5-FU resistance (E). (F) Venn plot showing differentially enriched
  genes in four groups as following: oxaliplatin treated cells, 5-FU treated cells;
  patients with higher-SIIS value in TCGA-COAD and GSE39582 dataset; (G) Forest plots
  showing the correlation of gene expression of GPX3 and PRICKLE2 with overall survival
  in different subgroups (left) and the benefit of ADJC performance in patients with
  different expression levels of GPX3 and PRICKLE2 (right). (H-I) Box plot of the
  comparison of the GPX3 and PRICKLE2 expression between the fluorouracil response
  and nonresponse groups (H) and among various CMS subtypes in the GSE39582, TCGA-COAD,
  and SYSUCC cohorts (I). (J) Correlation matrix showing the correlations of GPX3
  and PRICKLE2 expression with the infiltration level of TME cells (left) and with
  the activation level of biological process (right) in the GSE39582, TCGA-COAD, and
  SYSUCC cohorts. (K) The correlation chord chart showing the mutual correlation between
  SIIS value, the gene expression of GPX3 and PRICKLE2, and the GSVA score of non
  canonical WNT pathway, canonical WNT pathway, and WNT/PCP pathway in the GSE39582
  cohort (left), in the TCGA-COAD cohort (middle), and in the SYSUCC cohort (right).
  (L-M) Box plot of the comparison of the GSVA score of WNT/PCP pathway between the
  fluorouracil response and nonresponse groups (L) and among various CMS subtypes
  (M) in the GSE39582, TCGA-COAD, and SYSUCC cohorts. OXA, oxaliplatin; FC, fold change;
  Tcm, T central memory; Tem, T effector memory; Th, T helper; DC, dendritic cell;
  aDC, activated dendritic cell; iDC, immature dendritic cell; Tgd, T gamma delta;
  NK, natural killer; CI, confidence interval; ADJC, adjuvant chemotherapy; R response;
  NR, nonresponse; CMS, consensus molecular subtypes; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition;
  OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation; UPR, unfolded protein response; FA, fatty acid;
  GSVA, gene set variation analysis.'
