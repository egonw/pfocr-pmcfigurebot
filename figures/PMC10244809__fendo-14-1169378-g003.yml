caption: 'Expression levels of effector molecule in TGF-β signaling pathway. (A) The
  relative mRNA expression of Acvr2b (in oocytes, n=10) and ligand, Activin A and
  GDF8 (in granulosa cells, containing granulosa cells around 5 oocytes), was confirmed
  by RT-qPCR. Each treatment was repeated 3 times. *P < 0.05 represent significant
  differences between two groups. NS, not significant. (B) Immunofluorescence assay
  of Acvr2b for oocytes. Each treatment was repeated 3 times with each replicate containing
  about 5 oocytes. Scale bar: 100μm. (C) Mean fluorescence intensity of Acvr2b in
  two groups. **P < 0.01 represent significant differences between two groups.'
