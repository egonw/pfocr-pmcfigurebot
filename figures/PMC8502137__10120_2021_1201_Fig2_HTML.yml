caption: Genomic alterations of signaling pathways in ZJU-GC cohort. Gene somatic
  mutations and copy number variations are characterized in key signaling pathways,
  including RTK/RAS/PI(3)K pathway, cell adhesion pathway, cell cycle pathway, and
  chromatin remodeling pathway. Genes are grouped by the pathways and linked by the
  line and arrows showing molecular interactions
