caption: Structures of rosin derivative dehydroabietic acid and dehydroabietic amine
  (a), androgen (b), and IDOAMP (c). Growth inhibition of LNCaP, PC3, and DU145 cells
  in the presence of IDOAMP after 24 h treatment (d). (IDOAMP exhibited an inhibitory
  effect on LNCaP, PC3, and DU145 cells for drug groups at different concentrations
  compared with control group.) Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3). ∗∗p < 0.01
  and ∗∗∗p < 0.001 vs. the control group.
