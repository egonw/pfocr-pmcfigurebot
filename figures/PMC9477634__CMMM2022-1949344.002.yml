caption: 'CX3CL1 derived from BMSCs statistically augmented Aβ1-42-induced SH-SY5Y
  viability but repressed apoptosis. (a) CCK-8 assay assessed SH-SY5Y viability. (b
  and c) Flow cytometry evaluated SH-SY5Y apoptosis. (d and e) Western blotting determined
  cleaved caspase-3 expression relative to β-actin. ∗p < 0.05 versus control group;
  #p < 0.05 versus Aβ group; &p < 0.05 versus Aβ+MSC group.'
