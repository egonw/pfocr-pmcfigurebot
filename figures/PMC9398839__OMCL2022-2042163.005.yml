caption: 'PSG suppressed SLI via inhibiting the LPS/TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway in DSS-induced
  IBD mice. (a) Histological analysis for liver tissues by H&E staining. Protein expressions
  of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway in the liver tissues were determined by Western
  blot assay (b) and quantitative analysis for Western blot results (n = 3) (c). Effects
  of PSG on LPS (d) and IL-10 (e) in the liver tissues of IBD mice. Results were expressed
  as mean ± SEM. ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01 vs. the control group; #p < 0.05 and ##p
  < 0.01 vs. the model group (DSS only).'
