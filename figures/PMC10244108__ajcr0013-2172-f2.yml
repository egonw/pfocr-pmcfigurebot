caption: Verifying the efficiency of siRNA transfection and expression levels of CXXL17
  and GPR35. A. The transfection efficiency of CXCL17 was verified by RT-qPCR; B.
  The expression of CXCL17 and GPR35 was detected by ELISA; C. The protein levels
  of CXCL17 and GPR35 was detected by Western-blot. Compared with siNC group, *P <
  0.05; **P < 0.01.
article_title: Activation of the IL-17 signalling pathway by the CXCL17-GPR35 axis
  affects drug resistance and colorectal cancer tumorigenesis.
