caption: One-pot reactions of oxylipin pathway enzymes with ω-transaminase TRAD for
  the synthesis of 12-aminododecenoic acid. a HPLCP-N was coupled with TRAD using
  1 mM and 2.5 mM 13S-HPODE as substrate. Blue bars = simultaneous enzyme addition,
  red bars = HPL addition before TRAD, grey bars = TRAD addition before HPL dosage
  in portions. b LOX-1 was coupled with HPLCP-N and TRAD using 1 mM and 2.5 mM linoleic
  acid as substrate. Blue bars = simultaneous enzyme addition, red bars = LOX-1 was
  added before HPLCP-N and then TRAD was added, grey bars = LOX-1 was added before
  TRAD addition and HPLCP-N dosage in portions
