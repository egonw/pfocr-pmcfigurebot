caption: 'AKG inhibited the inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and apoptosis
  induced by OGD/R in SH-SY5Y cells. (a–c) The levels of proinflammatory cytokines
  were measured using ELISA (n = 5). (d) The levels of SOD were determined using a
  SOD kit (n = 5). (e and f) The levels of superoxide anions as determined by DCFH-DA
  staining are shown in representative photos and quantitative analysis (n = 5). (g
  and h) Quantification of TUNEL-positive cells in SH-SY5Y cells in the indicated
  groups (n = 5) (TUNEL, green; DAPI, blue). ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 versus the control
  group and #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01 versus the OGD/R group.'
