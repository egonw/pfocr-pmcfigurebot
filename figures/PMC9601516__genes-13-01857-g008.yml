caption: Summary of IPA Pathway Activity Analysis of DEGs observed comparison of NCT
  and RBC2 SCs differentiated at 38 °C (A), 33 °C (B) or 43 °C (C). Pictured are the
  number of affected molecules, gene expression pattern and z-score for the significant
  canonical pathways with the greatest absolute z-score. Directional expression of
  genes is indicated by red (up) or green (down) and relative z-score by color intensity
  (orange = positive z and blue = negative z).
