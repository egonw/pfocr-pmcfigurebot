caption: Model of SFKs activity facilitating the crosstalk between CGRP and cytokines
  by transmitting CGRP receptor signaling to potentiate TG sensitization. SFKs are
  activated in response to ROS to induce CGRP release in small to medium neurons;
  released CGRP binds to CGRP receptor (dotted line with arrow) to activate SFKs in
  large neurons and satellite glial cells, which causes IL-1β, CCL2, CXCL1 release
  and IL-1β, CCL2 gene expression, thus leading to TG sensitization.
