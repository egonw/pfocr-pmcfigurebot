figure_title: TRAF2 negatively regulates the protein levels of p62 and autophagy flux
caption: A, B Knockdown or knockout of TRAF2 increases p62 level. C TRAF2 overexpression
  decreases the p62 level. D Huh7 was transfected with siCtrl and TRAF family siRNA
  oligos for 48 h, and p62 protein level was analyzed by Western blot. E Correlation
  of TRAF2 and p62 in HCC tissue microarrays (*p = 0.0063, Pearson’s correlation coefficient).
  T, tumor tissue. A, adjacent nontumor tissue. F LC3 and p62 protein level in TRAF2-deletion
  Huh7 cells. G LC3 punctate structures were shown by fluorescence microscopy (left,
  bar:10 μm), ***p < 0.001 (right, Student’s t-test, two-tailed, mean ± SEM, n = 5).
article_title: The TRAF2-p62 axis promotes proliferation and survival of liver cancer
  by activating mTORC1 pathway.
