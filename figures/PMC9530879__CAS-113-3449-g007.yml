caption: Kallikrein (KLK) drives inflammation status in the severely cardiotoxic patient
  group (SP) through activated protease‐activated receptor 2 (PAR2). (A) Proposed
  KLK‐PAR2‐MAPK and ErbB signaling pathways in the patient‐specific induced pluripotent
  stem cell‐derived cardiomyocyte (pt‐iPSC‐CM) model. Pathways validated in this study
  are shown as dotted lines. (B, C) KLK5 and KLK8 levels detected in culture supernatant
  of pt‐iPSC‐CMs, as measured by ELISA. (D) Representative western blot analysis of
  PAR2 protein expression. (E) Quantification of PAR2 normalized to GAPDH. (F) PAR2
  signaling assessed by Ca2+ transients induced by trypsin, a PAR2 agonist. (G, H)
  Representative western blot and quantification of p‐ERK1/2 and ERK1/2. (I, J) Representative
  western blot and quantification of p‐JNK and JNK protein expression. Data were obtained
  using pt‐iPSC‐CMs from six individuals, assays were repeated three to five times
  for ELISA and Ca2+ transients and twice for western blots. All data are expressed
  as mean ± SEM. NRG‐1, neuregulin‐1; SP, severely cardiotoxic patient group
