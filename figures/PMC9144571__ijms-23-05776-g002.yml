caption: 'Regulation of proliferation, differentiation, and bone matrix protein gene
  expression by Runx2 during osteoblast differentiation: Runx2 induces the commitment
  of multipotent mesenchymal cells to preosteoblasts and enhances the proliferation
  of osteoblast progenitors by inducing the expressions of hedgehog, fibroblast grow
  factor (Fgf), Wnt, and Pthlh signaling pathway genes and distal-less homeobox 5
  (Dlx5), which also enhance Runx2 expression and Runx2 protein activity. Runx2 also
  induces Sp7 expression. Runx2, Sp7 and Wnt signaling induce the differentiation
  of preosteoblasts into immature osteoblasts. Sp7 and Wnt signaling activate the
  osteoblast-specific Runx2 enhancer. In immature osteoblasts, Runx2 induces the expressions
  of bone matrix protein genes, including Col1a1, Col1a2, Spp1, Ibsp, and bone gamma
  carboxyglutamate protein (Bglap)/Bglap2, and the osteoblasts maturate and produce
  abundant bone matrix proteins. Runx2 also induces tumor necrosis factor superfamily
  member 11 (Tnfsf11) expression and enhances bone resorption. Osteocalcin (Bglap/Bglap2)
  aligns the apatite crystals parallel to collagen fibers. The collagen fibers run
  along the longitudinal direction in the dialysis of long bone, which is formed by
  mature osteoblasts, whereas collagen fibers run irregularly in metaphyseal cortical
  bone in young mice, which is formed by immature osteoblasts. However, apatite crystals
  are always aligned parallel to the collagen fibers by osteocalcin [].'
