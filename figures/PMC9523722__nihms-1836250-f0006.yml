figure_title: Molecular mechanisms of response to BET and MCL1 co-targeting
caption: '(A) Differential analysis of phosphoproteomic responses to BETis in resistant
  (HCC1954, BT474) and sensitive (SKOV3) cells. The heatmap represents the average
  log fold difference (log[Xperturbed/Xunperturbed]) across the four BETis (). “R
  to S deviation” is the fold changes between responses in resistant (HCC1954 and
  BT474) and sensitive (SKOV3) cells. The proteins with significantly different expressions
  between HCC1954 (most resistant) and SKOV3 (sensitive line) are listed (padj < 0.05).(B)
  MCL1 and signaling activity changes in response to cocktails of pathway and BET
  inhibitors are monitored to demonstrate the role of signaling pathways linking BET
  and MCL1 activity.(C) Differential analysis of transcriptomic responses (mean of
  duplicates) to BETi (1 μM, 24 h). The first three columns demonstrate fold changes
  of mRNA species that change in opposite directions in resistant versus sensitive
  lines. The red/white columns on right represent the involvement of each gene in
  different molecular processes according to a GO-term enrichment analysis.(D) Transcriptomic
  responses (mean of duplicates) in key genes of the lipid metabolism pathway as identified
  by the differential response analysis from the RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data (left)
  and confirmed based on qPCR analyses for the key rate-limiting enzyme SCD. RNA-seq
  analysis: error bars represent the ±SEM. pPCR analysis: error bars represent the
  ±SD.(E) The differential analysis focusing only on total protein changes performed
  as in (A). The heatmaps represent the proteomic responses averaged across four BETis.(F)
  The analysis of SCD, MCL1, and p-EGFR/p-HER2 levels in response to inhibitors of
  BET (JQ1) and SCD (A939572), as well as BRD4 KDs with siRNA.(G) Representative images
  of IHC analysis of in vivo SCD expression in the mouse xenograft model (MDA-MB468)
  treated with BET and MCL1 inhibitors. Error bars represent the ±SD.(H) ChIP-seq
  analysis of BRD4 binding on SCD gene regulatory sites in breast cancer cell lines
  treated with BETis (JQ1) (see  for FASN and SREBF1).(I) Correlation analysis of
  proteomic and transcriptomic levels involved in the associations linking BET to
  EGFR/HER2 within tumors of patients with ERBB2-amplified, basal breast, and ovarian
  cancer. All correlations are in the range of −0.5 to 0.5. As a reference, the average
  correlation between mRNA and protein levels of a given gene is estimated within
  a range of 0.3–0.6 across the whole genome (; ) (data from TCGA breast and ovarian
  cancer projects).'
