caption: M2 macrophages depletion and NOTCH1 signaling inhibition impaired PCa cell
  lung metastasis. (A) A lung metastasis model (n=3) was established by tail injection
  of 1×106 DU145-luc and 22RV1-luc cells (mixed with 2×105 THP-1-derived TAMs) into
  nude mice. Pharm treatment was used (including PBS, DAPT, liposomal clodronate or
  combination) once tail injection was finished. An IVIS-200 bioluminescence system
  was used to monitor lung metastasis once a week, and node mice were sacrificed after
  6 weeks. (B) Quantification of lung metastasis nodes is displayed as indicated.
  (C) Metastatic lungs are displayed as indicated (left, fluorescence; right, brightness,
  n=3). (D) Alizarin red staining was used to observe the metastatic node of each
  group. (E) DU145-luc and 22RV1-luc cells (mixed with 2×105 THP-1-derived M2 macrophages)
  (1×106) were used to establish a lung metastasis model (n=3). Adenovirus carrying
  NOTCH1 shRNA was injected into mouse lung tissue until tumor metastasis formation.
  An IVIS-200 bioluminescence system was used to monitor lung metastasis diminishing.
  (F) Kaplan-Meier survival curves are displayed as indicated. (G) Intralung injection
  of shNOTCH1 adenovirus suppressed metastatic MET-associated tumor cell plantation
  (N-cadherin, far-red; E-cadherin, green). (H) Immunofluorescence assays showed that
  intralung injection of shNOTCH1 adenovirus significantly reduced F4/80+CD206+ TAM
  recruitment (F4/80, far-red; CD206, green) (*p<0.05, **p<0.01).
