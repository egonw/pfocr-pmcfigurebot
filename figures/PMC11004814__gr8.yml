caption: 'GO enrichment analysis of Hub MRGs. A: Bubble plot of enriched GO terms.
  B–D: Cnetplots of BP pathway (B), CC pathway (C), and MF pathway (D) in the GO enrichment
  analysis of Hub MRGs. Purple dots represent specific genes and orange dots represent
  specific pathways in the Cnetplot. MRGs, Mitophagy-related genes; GO, Gene Ontology;
  BP, biological process; CC, cellular component; MF, molecular function. Annotation
  of the GO terms in figure: Peptidyl-serine dephosphorylation – Refers to the removal
  of a phosphate group from serine residues on peptides. Protein dephosphorylation
  – The process of removing phosphate groups from proteins, which is important for
  regulating protein function. Cell chemotaxis – Movement of a cell or organism in
  response to a chemical stimulus. Negative regulation of cell cycle – Processes that
  stop or slow down the cell cycle, preventing the cell from dividing. Dephosphorylation
  – The general process of removing phosphate groups from molecules like proteins.
  Protein phosphatase type 2A complex – A type of enzyme complex involved in catalyzing
  the removal of phosphate groups. Magnesium-dependent protein serine/threonine phosphatase
  complex – A group of enzymes requiring magnesium ions to catalyze the dephosphorylation
  of serine/threonine residues in proteins. Protein serine/threonine phosphatase complex
  – Enzymes that are specialized in removing phosphate groups from serine/threonine
  residues in proteins. Oxidoreductase complex – Complexes of enzymes involved in
  oxidation-reduction reactions, transferring electrons from one molecule to another.
  Endoplasmic reticulum protein-containing complex – Proteins or complexes involving
  proteins that reside in the endoplasmic reticulum. Protein tyrosine/threonine phosphatase
  activity – Enzymatic activity involved in removing phosphate from tyrosine and threonine
  residues in proteins. Nuclear glucocorticoid receptor binding – Interaction with
  the glucocorticoid receptor located within the nucleus, often with a regulatory
  role. MAP kinase phosphatase activity – Enzymes that deactivate MAP kinases by dephosphorylation,
  thus regulating various cellular processes. Ligand-activated transcription factor
  activity – Transcription factors that are activated by the binding of specific ligands
  to influence gene expression. Protein phosphatase regulator activity – Enzymatic
  regulation involving modulating the activity of protein phosphatases. (For interpretation
  of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
  Web version of this article.)'
