caption: Effects of RES and MOS on suppression of the CSC-like phenotype in lung cancer
  cells. (A) The single spheroid from CSC-rich population of A549 cells were treated
  with non-toxic concentrations of RES and MOS (0 − 2.5 µM) for 3 days, and CSC viability
  was determined using Hoechst 33,342/PI double staining. The single spheroid from
  CSC-rich population of A549 cells were treated with 1 µM of RES or MOS for 24 h.
  (B) The expression levels of CD133 and (C) p-Akt were determined using anti-CD133
  and anti-p-Akt (Ser473) antibody followed by Alexa Fluor 488-labeled secondary antibody
  or Alexa Fluor 594-labeled secondary antibody and Hoechst 33,342. The expression
  was visualized by fluorescence microscopy
