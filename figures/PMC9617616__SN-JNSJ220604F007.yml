caption: 'Temporal control of ANL treatment improves MS/MS detection of newly synthetized
  proteins in excitatory cortical neurons after acute seizure induced by PTZ. A, Experimental
  design to identify changes in newly synthetized proteins after acute seizure. mMetRSKI/KI/EMXcre
  mice received a single intraperitoneal dose of 47 μg/kg PTZ together with ANL or
  saline; 18–20 h later, brains were collected and cortex was isolated and processed
  for click chemistry with heavy and light biotin alkynes and DiDBiT to isolate biotinylated
  peptides for mass spectrometry protein identification. B, Volcano plot showing quantitative
  proteomic analysis of changes in newly synthesized proteins induced by PTZ compared
  with saline. N = 4 independent experiments (3 pairs of males and 1 pair of females).
  Significantly increased and decreased (p < 0.05, |FC| > 1.5) newly synthetized proteins
  are labeled in red and blue, respectively (Extended Data , see for list of all quantified
  peptides; Extended Data , see for lists of proteins from the 7 and 1 d ANL treatment
  experiments). C, Western blots of inputs and IPs comparing selected NSPs in saline-injected
  and PTZ-injected samples. Quantification of labeling: individual datapoints and
  mean ± SEM; N = 4 independent samples. *p < 0.05 Student''s t test with Welsh''s
  correction. n.s., not significant; sal, saline. D, IPA (QIAGEN) canonical pathway
  analysis identified the signaling pathways that change the most in response to PTZ
  treatment compared with saline treatment. The color of bars represents the z score
  (values provided to right within bars) that predict increases (red) or decreases
  (blue) in the function of each pathway. The gray bar represents pathways where no
  prediction can be made (Extended Data ). E, Comparative analysis showing z scores
  of the most significantly changed canonical pathways across 6 independent samples
  (S1-S6; 3 pairs of males and 3 pairs of females; Extended Data ).'
