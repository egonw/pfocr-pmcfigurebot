figure_title: Identification of Notch pathway genetic variants in MIS-C
caption: 'a,b. KEGG and GO pathways differentially enriched in rare mutations in MIS-C
  versus Acute COVID-19 by Monte Carlo simulation and Fished Test.as described in
  the Material’s and Methods section. b. Frequency of mutations in two representative
  pathways (“positive regulation of NF-kB signaling” and “inflammatory response to
  antigenic stimulus”) identified in A versus other disease groups either collectively
  by Monte Carlo simulation or individually by Fischer test. c. Schematic representation
  of NUMB and NUMBL mutations identified in MIS-C subjects. d,e. Expression of recombinant
  wild type NUMB protein (NUMBWT) and NUMBLeu94Phe (D), and NUMBLWT, NUMBLSer79Ile
  and NUMBLVal88Met proteins (E) in NUMB/NUMBL-deficient HEK293 cells. f,g. Flow cytometric
  analysis and fold expression of NOTCH1 and N1c in NUMB/NUMBL-deficient HEK293 cell
  transfected with either NUMBLeu94Phe (F), NUMBLSer79Ile or NUMBLVal88Met proteins
  (G) either alone or together with the respective WT proteins. h. Scheme of mouse
  Poly IC treatment. i,j. Body weight index change (I) and peak weight loss (J) of
  the Foxp3YFPCre and Foxp3YFPCreNumbΔ/Δ mice treated with Poly IC. k,l. Flow cytometric
  analysis and cell frequencies of CD44+CD62L– (k) and IFNg+IL-17– Tconv cells (l).
  m, n. Flow cytometric analysis (m) and frequencies of Notch1+ and Notch1c+ Treg
  cells Error bars indicate SEM. Statistical tests for panels d-f: *P<0.05, **P<0.01,
  ***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001 by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc analysis.'
