caption: Boxplots of inflammatory cytokine levels in the BALF at 48 h after LPS-induced
  ALI. Compared to the control group, concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 in the BALF
  were significantly decreased in the MSC group. Although not reaching statistical
  significance, levels of TNF-α, MCP-1, and IL-1β trended lower in the MSC group.
  Each circle represents the concentration of each animal. n = 8 mice/group.
