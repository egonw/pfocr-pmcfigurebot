caption: 'PAK1 enrichment restores mitochondrial structure/function. (A) Schematic
  of insulin resistance (Ins R) reversal approach using rat L6.GLUT4myc myotubes.
  Post-Ins R L6.GLUT4myc myotubes were transduced with Ad-GFP-hPAK1 (PAK1 overexpression)
  or CTRL-Ad-GFP (control). Transduced-Ins R cells were stimulated with insulin for
  20 min and were used in (B–G). n = 3–4 independent cell passages per group. (B–G)
  PAK1-OE, PAK1 overexpression. (B) Seahorse analysis of OCR; inset, representative
  Western blot of cells used for seahorse. (C) OCR quantitation (% of baseline). (D)
  Western blot quantitation of electron transport chain oxidative complex/oxphos proteins.
  (E) Confocal microscopy images of mitochondria using Mito tracker Green (pseudo
  colored white); scale bar = 10 μm (top), bottom inset: 9× zoom of original magnification
  in the boxed area. (F) Quantification of mitochondrial copy number by comparing
  the levels of cytochrome b to 18s ribosomal DNA. (G) Quantification of superoxide
  radical levels. Circle and square symbols in the bar graphs represent the number
  of independent cell passages used. (B–D,F,G) Data: mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05, ** p
  < 0.01 (one-way ANOVA/Bonferroni post hoc test or unpaired two-tailed Student’s
  t-test).'
