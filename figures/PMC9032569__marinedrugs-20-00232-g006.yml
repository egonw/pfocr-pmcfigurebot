caption: 'Inhibitory effects of FCP on cisplatin-induced activation of p38 MAPK, JNK,
  and ERK signaling pathway. The expression of p38 MAPK, JNK, and ERK was increased
  in the cisplatin alone-treated TECs, as assessed by Western blot analysis (A). The
  pretreatment of TECs with FCP blocked the cisplatin-induced phosphorylation of p38
  MAPK, JNK, and ERK. Bar graphs depict relative densitometry quantitation of each
  protein normalized to β-actin (B). Results are presented as the means ± SD of three
  independent experiments. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 vs. the control. ## p < 0.01,
  ### p < 0.001 vs. the cisplatin alone-treated group.'
