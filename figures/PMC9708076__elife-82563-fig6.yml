figure_title: Suppressor mutants partially restore virulence in the G. mellonella
  model
caption: (A) G. mellonella larvae were infected with 5×104 fungal cells of the indicated
  strain, and their survival was monitored for 15 days post-inoculation. The cbk1Δ
  group survival curve was not significantly different from sup1 (p-value=0.2) and
  was significantly different from the sup2 curve (p-value=0.05). (B) At day 5 post-inoculation
  (DPI 5), 5 out of 25 larvae per group for the H99, the cbk1Δ mutant, sup1, and sup2
  groups were homogenized, serially diluted, and plated to count the colony-forming
  units (CFUs) and measure the fungal burden of each larva. The fungal burden of the
  sup1 and sup2 groups was significantly higher than the cbk1Δ group (p-value<0.001).
