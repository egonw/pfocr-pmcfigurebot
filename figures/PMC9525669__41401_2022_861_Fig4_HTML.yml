figure_title: Cx43 dysfunction contributes to depression through peripheral mechanisms
caption: (1) ERS in hepatocytes spreads through Cx43 GJCs and promotes insulin resistance.
  (2) Insulin resistance causes Cx43 GJC dysfunction by increasing the level of H2O2
  in vascular smooth muscle cells. (3) TSH promotes TH production by increasing the
  synthesis of Cx43 and inducing the opening of Cx43 GJCs in thyrocytes. (4) Excessive
  CORT produced by adrenocortical cells causes Cx43 GJC dysfunction of astrocytes
  in the brain. (5) Under conditions of stress, activated microglia releases inflammatory
  factors, promoting Cx43 HC opening and Cx43 GJC dysfuntion of astrocytes. (6) Opened
  HCs further contribute to the activation and spread of the inflammasome pathway.
  (7) Insulin resistance can promote neuroinflammation and affect the brain function.
  CORT corticosterone, ERS endoplasmic reticulum stress, GJCs gap junction channels,
  HC hemichannel, TH thyroid hormone, TSH thyroid stimulating hormone.
