caption: Effect of esculetin on the mRNA expression level of apoptosis-related factors
  in A253 cells. Relative mRNA levels of Bax, Bcl-2 and Caspase-3 were assessed using
  quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Data are presented as the mean Â± standard
  deviation (n=3; *P<0.05 and **P<0.01 vs. untreated control group).
