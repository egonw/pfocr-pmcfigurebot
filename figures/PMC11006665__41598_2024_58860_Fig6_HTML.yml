caption: (a) Immunoblot analysis demonstrating the knockdown (KD) efficacy of β-catenin
  in stromal cells compared to control. (b) Alizarin Red S staining demonstrates less
  osteoblast differentiation in HS-5 β-catenin KD cells (n = 6). (c) HS-5 β-catenin
  KD cells reversed the drug resistance in leukemia cells when co-cultured with the
  knockdown cells compared to scrambled HS-5 cells as shown by annexin V apoptosis
  assay for 48 h (n = 4). (d) Inhibition of the Wnt signaling pathway using a known
  Wnt inhibitor and an anthelmintic drug, pyrvinium pamoate (PYR), overcomes osteoblast
  differentiation, as evident by Alizarin Red S staining on MSCs co-cultured with
  leukemic cells U937 and differentiated to osteoblast for 14 days with PYR at concentration
  0.1 µM (n = 4). (e) PYR pre-treatment reversed drug resistance in leukemic cells
  (NB4) upon pre-treatment with PYR, and the viability of leukemic cells was assessed
  after 48 h (n = 3). (f) Workflow of APL mice model on treatment with PYR and ATO.
  (g) PYR, when combined with ATO, reduced the leukemic burden (GR1+ CD117+ cells)
  in the APL mice model as evaluated by flow cytometry analysis in peripheral blood
  on day 28. (h) Combination of PYR with ATO in APL mice prolonged the survival of
  the mice compared to placebo or either of the agents treated alone (n = 6). For
  survival, a log-rank test was employed to calculate significance. (i) PYR pre-treatment
  effectively overcomes the stromal cell-mediated drug resistance in combination with
  Ara-C and DNR in AML BM MNCs (n = 17). Each dot represents a patient sample. (*—P = 0.05,
