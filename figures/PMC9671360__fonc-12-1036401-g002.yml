caption: Increased expression of DJ-1 in OS cell lines promotes cell proliferation,
  clonal formation and migration. (A). WB of DJ-1 expression on a panel of human BMSCs
  and OS cell lines; (B, C). Overexpression or knockdown of DJ-1 in MG63 and U2OS
  cell lines were constructed. (D, E). CCK-8 was performed to observe the effects
  of DJ-1 knockdown or overexpression on cell proliferation in MG63 and U2OS cells.
  (F). Cell cycle distribution was evaluated by flow cytometry and shown by bar charts.
  (G, H). Colony formation and transwell migration assays indicated that DJ-1 could
  promote the migration of OS cells. The Original uncut western bands are shown in
  . n = 3 per group. **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
