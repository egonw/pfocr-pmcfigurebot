caption: Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) of different salt-tolerant cultivars
  in response to salt stress treatments during seed germination. (A) Number of DEPs
  in barley GN2 and GN18. (B) Venn diagram analyses of DEPs in seeds. The magnitude
  of the Rich Factor is positively correlated with the significance of the enrichment.
  (C) Visualization of common differentially abundant proteins between GN2 and GN18
  and their KEGG pathway classification.
