caption: LRRK2 G2019S mutation deregulates the TH–DA pathway, contributing to DA neurodegeneration
  in Drosophila PD model. Yellow white control, LRRK2 TG Drosophila and LRRK2 RNAi
  Drosophila lines are crossed with ddc-GAL4 line to modulate LRRK2 expression in
  Drosophila head DA neurons and cultured for different time periods. A Locomotor
  deficits of climbing ability of Drosophila with or without TG expression of human
  WT and G2019S LRRK2 in Drosophila head DA neurons after 1 day and 60 days culture.
  *, at least P < 0.05, compared with the percentage of Drosophila on top of the control
  group. B Representative confocal image of TH neurons in Drosophila heads of control
  and LRRK2 TG Drosophila cultured for 1 day or 60 days. C HPLC analysis of DA content
  in Drosophila heads of control and LRRK2 TG Drosophila at different culture time
  points. *, at least P < 0.05, compared with DA content in Drosophila heads of control
  group at the respective time points. D and E Number of TH-positive dopaminergic
  neurons in Drosophila heads cultured for 1 day (D) and 60 days (E), *, at least
  P < 0.05, compared with the number of TH positive neurons in control Drosophila
  heads cultured for 60 days. F HPLC analysis of DA content in Drosophila heads of
  control and LRRK2 RNAi Drosophila lines. *P < 0.05, compared with DA content in
  Drosophila heads of control group at the respective culture time points. G Representative
  Western blot TH levels in Drosophila heads of 3 days cultured control, TG LRRK2
  and LRRK2 RNAi Drosophila lines. H Densitometric analysis of TH bands in Western
  blot gels in G. *, at least P < 0.05, compared with the arbitrary value of TH bands
  in control Drosophila heads
