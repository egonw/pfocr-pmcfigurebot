caption: Conformation transition of the Raf kinase domain. The kinase domain consists
  of an N-terminal lobe (N-lobe) and a C-terminal lobe (C-lobe) linked through a hinge.
  αC-helix and DFG (green) alter from OUT to IN position upon Raf activation, resulting
  in a dimer with side-to-side interface “closed” conformation. The conformational
  transition between inactive and active states is shown.
