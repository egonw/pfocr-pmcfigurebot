caption: Schematic of VEGFR1 vs. VEGFR2 signaling activation by VEGF165b in ischemic
  endothelium. The left panel shows the classical VEGF165a induced VEGFR2 signaling
  pathway in ECs. The middle panel demonstrates that VEGF165b treatment induces VEGFR2-AKT-ERK
  signaling but inhibits VEGFR1-STAT3 signaling in ischemic ECs. Despite activating
  VEGFR2 signaling, the inhibition of VEGFR1 signaling resulted in angiogenic inhibition
  in ischemic ECs treated with VEGF165b. In the right panel, antibody-mediated VEGF165b
  inhibition increased the bioavailability of VEGF165a to VEGFR1 (due to its 10X higher
  binding affinity to VEGFR1 over VEGFR2) and activated VEGFR1-STAT3 signaling but
  resulted in the loss of VEGFR2 signaling activation. Activating VEGFR1-STAT3 signaling-induced
  ischemic angiogenesis independent of VEGFR2 signaling.
