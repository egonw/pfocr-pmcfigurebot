figure_title: Calcium signaling in efferocytosis
caption: Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) is induced upon apoptotic cell stimulation.
  Mertk binding to PS on apoptotic cells activates the downstream signaling pathway,
  inducing the release of calcium from the ER and thus the interaction between Stim1
  and Orai1, which ultimately causes calcium entry into phagocytes during efferocytosis.
  In addition, Drp-1 upregulation during efferocytosis induces mitochondrial fission,
  which impedes MCU-mediated mitochondrial calcium sequestration. This SOCE and impairment
  of mitochondrial calcium sequestration elevate the intracellular calcium level in
  phagocytes during efferocytosis.
