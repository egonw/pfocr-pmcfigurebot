caption: The results of the integration analysis. (A) Relational Graph of key candidate
  genes and DMs. Green node represents DM, yellow node represents candidate gene,
  and red node represents hub gene. The red and green lines represent positive and
  negative correlations, respectively. The thicker the line, the larger the correlation
  coefficient, and the thinner the line, the smaller the correlation coefficient;
  (B) GO functional classification; Biological processes, molecular functions, and
  cellular components associated with hub genes; (C) Pathway analysis of hub genes.
  The X-axis represents the number of annotated genes. The Y-axis represents the pathway
  terms.
