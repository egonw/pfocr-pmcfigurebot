caption: Vascular endothelial cells undergo remodeling with activated HIF-1α signaling
  after Que treatment. (A) Sankey plots showing changes (Que versus vehicle) in the
  number of potential receptor-ligand interaction events between HF subclusters and
  other niche cell types. Cell types were ordered by the changes of receptor-ligand
  pair interaction strength. (B) Immunofluorescence staining of endothelial cell marker
  VWF and GL marker P-cadherin (Pcad) in skin tissues on day 3 post-treatment with
  vehicle or Que. Right, the quantitative data of VWF-positive area around GL. Vehicle,
  n = 6; Que, n = 6, and 15 GLs were calculated for each individual. Two-tailed unpaired
  Student’s t-test was used and data are presented as the mean ± SEMs. Scale bars,
  50 μm. (C) Immunofluorescence staining of VWF and Ki67 in skin tissue on day 3 post-treatment
  with vehicle or Que. Right, the quantitative data of Ki67-positive cells in VWF-positive
  cells. Vehicle, n = 6; Que, n = 6, and 15 HFs were calculated for each individual.
  Two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test was used and data are presented as the mean
  ± SEMs. Scale bars, 50 μm. (D) Ridge plots showing AUC scores of gene set related
  to angiogenesis, migration, and proliferation in endothelial cells on day 3 post-treatment
  with vehicle or Que. (E) Venn plot showing the number of genes shared among gene
  sets related to angiogenesis, migration, and proliferation. The expression profiles
  of shared genes were shown on the right. (F) Violin and box plot showing the transcriptional
  expression level of Hif-1α in endothelial cells on day 3 post-treatment with vehicle
  or Que. (G) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showing HIF-1 signaling pathway
  (left) and HIF-1α target genes (right) enriched in endothelial cells on day 3 post-treatment
  with vehicle or Que. NES, normalized enrichment score; FDR, false discovery rate.
