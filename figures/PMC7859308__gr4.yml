caption: LDN mediated the propagation property in cervical cancer cells through PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  signaling pathway. (A&B) Changes of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway-related protein
  in Hela and Siha cells treated LDN were examined by qPCR and Western Blot. For treatment
  with LDN, medium containing 1.24 (Hela) or 1.83 (Siha) mg/mL LDN was added.

  through suppressing PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.
