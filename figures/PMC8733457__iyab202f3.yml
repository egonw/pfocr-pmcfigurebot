caption: Suppression of perihatching arrest by insulin pathway mutations. Mutations
  in daf-16/FoxO and daf-18/PTEN fully suppress the perihatching arrest of daf-2;
  fax-1 double mutants. In contrast, a daf-5 TGFβ pathway mutation fails to suppress.
  Figure shows average results of standard 48 h at 25°C assays from multiple independent
  trials. Data shown are also included in . ***Pairwise differences significant at
  P ≪ 0.01. Error bars indicate standard deviation among replicate experiments.
