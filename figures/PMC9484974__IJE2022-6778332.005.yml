caption: Met suppressed osteoclastogenesis by blocking the ERK signaling pathway while
  having a limited effect on the p38 or JNK signaling pathways. BMMs were induced
  and cultivated in media containing 50 ng/mL M-CSF, 100 ng/mL RANKL, and 0, 200,
  or 400 ng/mL Met for 5 d before being collected and lysed for Western blot analysis.
