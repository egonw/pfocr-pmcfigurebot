caption: Effect of hinokitiol on tumor suppressor p-p53 protein expression. (A) MCF-7,
  (B) T47D, and (C) MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in a 6 cm dish and treated with
  hinokitiol for 48 h. Western blot was used to determine p-p53 protein expression.
  Data are presented as mean Â± SD (n = 3). ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001 as compared
  with control group.
