figure_title: BRAFV600E-ERK pathway activation results in a non-monotonic proliferation
  response
caption: '(A) Schematic of pathways activated by oncogenic BRAF (BRAF*). DDR, DNA-damage
  response; ROS, reactive oxygen species.(B and C) Western blot analysis of levels
  of BRAF, active pERK, the proliferation marker pRB, total RB, and MCM6 (B) following
  BRAFV600E induction by increasing doses of doxycycline (DOX; 0–250 ng/mL, 2-fold
  dilution from the right) for 72 h or (C) at the indicated time points following
  BRAFV600E induction with 250 ng/mL DOX. Actin is shown as a loading control.(D)
  Representative images of cells assayed for senescence-associated γ-galactosidase
  (SA-β-gal) activity 7 days after DOX induction of BRAFV600E-HA (BRAF*) at 250 ng/mL
  or after 10 Gy γ-irradiation. Bottom right: quantification of images. Data represent
  mean ± SD of three to five replicate wells; n > 560 cells/well for control; n >
  180 cells/well for BRAFV600E; n > 50 cells/well for γ-irradiation.(E) RPE/tet-BRAFV600E
  cells were treated with DOX as in (B) and immunostained for BRAFV600E-HA and pERK.
  Data from all DOX doses were pooled together, and single-cell pERK levels were extracted
  for equally spaced bins of BRAFV600E expression; n > 400 cells/bin. Each dot represents
  a single cell(F) RPE/tet-BRAFV600E cells were treated with serial doses of DOX as
  in (B) for 24, 48, or 72 h before immunostaining. The immunofluorescence data from
  all DOX doses were pooled, and the percentage of cells in S phase was calculated
  for equally spaced bins of ERK activity (mean ± 95% bootstrap confidence interval;
  n > 700 cells per bin).(G) RPE/tet-BRAFV600E cells were treated with DOX (250 ng/mL)
  and the indicated doses of ERKi for 72 h and then stained for the proliferation
  marker Ki67. The percentage of Ki67+ cells at each dose of ERKi is shown (mean ±
  SD of three replicate wells; n > 5,900 cells/well).'
