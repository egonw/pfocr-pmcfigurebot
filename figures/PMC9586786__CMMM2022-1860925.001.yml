caption: The number of HIF-1α positive cells. All HIF-1 expression data in this study
  were entered by the author into Excel software, and the statistical processing software
  was calculated by SPSS25.0, expressed as mean ± standard deviation, and found by
  independent samples t-test. In the brain the number of HIF-1α positive cells in
  the cortex increased only slightly after 6 h and 1 d after ischemia-reperfusion,
  and the number of HIF-1α positive cells after 6 h and 1 d was not significantly
  different from the control group (P > 0.05). The number of HIF-1α positive cells
  increased significantly when compared with the control group, and the difference
  was statistically significant (P < 0.05).
