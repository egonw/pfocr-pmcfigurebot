caption: The regulatory network of the RB-E2F pathway in gastric cancer. When cells
  receive growth stimuli, activation of CDKs leads to the phosphorylation of pocket
  proteins, collapse of the previously formed RB-E2F complexes and DREAM complexes.
  The subsequent release of E2F1-3 can activate target genes required for cell cycle
  entry. Meanwhile, this pathway is also regulated by upstream and downstream molecules
  in gastric cancer, such as CKIs, p53, TGF-Î²1, ATAD2 and SPIN1.
