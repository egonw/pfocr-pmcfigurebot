caption: Effect of constitutive activation of the Pal pathway through PalF ubiquitination
  in a null sltA background. (A) Comparative patterns of PTMs visualized by the immunodetection
  of tagged forms of PacC and PalF in wild-type and sltAΔ background (MAD7627 and
  MAD7630), and in wild-type and sltAΔ strains (MAD4499 and MAD7634) carrying the
  palF::ub construct that expresses a constitutively ubiquitinated version of PalF.
  A longer exposure of PalF immunoblot is shown (+exp) to better show the presence
  or absence of ubiquitinated and phosphorylated forms (Ub&PP). α-tubulin was used
  as the loading control protein. (B) Phenotypic analysis of strains used in panel
  (A) tested under alkaline pH conditions and two sodium molybdate concentrations.
  Strains were grown at 37 °C for 48 h and colonial growth was imaged. Numbers indicate
  tracks cited in the text.
