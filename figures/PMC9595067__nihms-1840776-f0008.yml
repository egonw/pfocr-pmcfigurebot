figure_title: In vivo multichannel extracellular recording of the response of GRPR
  neurons to scratching motion
caption: '(A) Experimental procedure of in vivo multichannel extracellular recording
  of SCN GRPR neurons of GrpriCre; Ai32 mice during the CIB test.(B) Cartoon showing
  the electrophysiological recording of SCN GRPR neurons. Note that the GrpriCre;
  Ai32 mouse with a self-made optrode with a 3D-printed protective hat, which was
  wrapped with copper tape and connected to the system ground to gain extra protection
  against electrical noise.(C) Photos showing the head of the GrpriCre; Ai32 mouse
  with the hat and an optrode, consisting of eight tetrodes and optical fiber with
  a microdrive (top right) that enables the D-V directional movement of the optrode
  in the brain and a cartoon showing the optrode implanted into the SCN of the GrpriCre;
  Ai32 mouse brain (bottom right).(D) Left: schematic of optrode implantation in the
  left side of the SCN. The optical fiber was connected to a 473 nm blue laser for
  the identification of ChR2-tagging GRPR neurons. Right: a representative image showing
  the histology of optical fiber (white arrow) and electrodes (red arrows) in the
  left side of the SCN.(E) Waveform (top) and auto-correlogram (bottom) of one well-isolated
  neuron from the SCN of GrpriCre; Ai32 mouse. A total of well-isolated 159 SCN neurons
  were sorted out from 7 GrpriCre: Ai32 mice.(F) Optogenetic identification of GRPR
  neurons. Spike raster (top) and peri-stimulus time histogram (PSTH) (bottom) for
  an identified GRPR neuron aligned to the onset of blue light pulse (top, blue line,
  473 nm, duration, 1 ms; power, 1 to 4 mW; frequency, 20 Hz).(G) Histogram of stimulus-associated
  spike latency test (SALT) for optical tagging showing p value distribution (p <
  0.01, blue). A total of 88 neurons were identified as GRPR neurons.(H) Distribution
  of 88 GRPR neurons according to their baseline firing rates.(Iâ€“K) Classification
  of 88 GRPR neurons based on their excitatory, inhibitory and no responses under
  three behavioral conditions: the control look (I), look-without-scratch (J), and
  imitative scratch (K).(L) Comparison of the percentage of GRPR neurons that were
  activated under three behavioral conditions.Chi-square test in (L), ***p < 0.001.'
