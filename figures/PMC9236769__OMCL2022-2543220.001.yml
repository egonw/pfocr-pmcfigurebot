caption: 'Effect of HCC culture medium on biological characteristics of ECDHCC-1 cells.
  (a and b) Cell viability (a) and cell apoptosis (b) of ECDHCC-1 cells were checked
  after incubation with HepG2-, HUH-7-, or THLE-2-conditioned media at the indicated
  ratio to ECDHCC-1 medium. (c–e) Fluorescence microscopy imaging of tube formation
  (c) and quantification of the number of nodes (d) and total tube length (e) by using
  tube formation assay utilizing the indicated medium with a 40% ratio to ECDHCC-1
  medium were analyzed. (f and g) Wound healing (f) and quantification of the relative
  scratch width (g) of ECDHCC-1 cells treated with the indicated medium with a 40%
  ratio to ECDHCC-1 medium were performed. Con: Control group. ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P <
  0.01 versus Con. (original magnifications: ×200 for fluorescence).'
