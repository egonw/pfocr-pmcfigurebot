caption: Exploration of the clinical significance of CDCA5. A–F, The Kaplan–Meier
  survival analyses suggest that the overexpression of CDCA5 exhibits excellent predictive
  capability in patients >65 years of age (A), both male and female (B), and early
  stage of Stage (C), T (D), N (E), and M (F), which always predict poor prognosis
  for patients with LUAD. G, GSEA reveals that several fundamental activities of cells,
  including cell cycle, base excision repair, DNA replication, mismatch repair, nucleotide
  excision repair, pyrimidine metabolism, RNA degradation, ubiquitin‐mediated proteolysis,
  and p53 signaling pathway were enriched in LUAD samples with higher expression of
  CDCA5. H–I, The expression of PD‐1 (H), and PD‐L1 (I) in LUAD samples with high
  CDCA5 expression are higher than LUAD samples with low CDCA5 expression

  and G1 phase arrest of non‐small cell lung cancer cells via p53‐p21 signaling pathway.
