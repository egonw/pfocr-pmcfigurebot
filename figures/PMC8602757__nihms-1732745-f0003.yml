figure_title: Knockout strains dysfunctional in biosynthesis of amino-acids, nucleotides,
  vitamins and co-factors, and central carbon metabolism benefit from condition media
caption: (A) Analysis of fold-change in strain representation and the statistical
  significance across the four screen conditions. The number of significantly enriched
  or depleted strains are shown on the upper corners (the vertical and horizontal
  black lines mark the fold-change and p-value cutoffs we used). The vast majority
  of hits were enriched, rather than depleted, in conditioned media. The total number
  of hits increased with conditioned media filtered from denser cultures. (B) Only
  a subset of auxotrophs that were enriched on nutrient-rich media also benefited
  from conditioned media. The Venn diagram shows the overlap between hits found to
  be enriched on nutrient-rich media (pink) and those found to be enriched on conditioned-media
  (orange). (C) A comparison of fold-change in knockout strain frequency on nutrient-rich
  media and on conditioned media. The fold-enrichment of common hits is correlated
  in the two screens (colors as in B). (D) The conditioned media enriched knockout
  strains are associated with specific metabolic functions. The colored bars show
  the fold-enrichment of hit strains in conditioned media filtered from the densest
  culture. 59 of 67 of the strains can be annotated as dysfunctional in biosynthesis
  of amino acids (green), nucleotides (blue), vitamins and co-factors (red), and central
  carbon metabolism (purple). Eight of the enriched strains belong to other biological
  categories (gray). (E) Analysis of KEGG pathway enrichment across all conditions.
  The circle plots show the number of genes belonging to the enriched pathway and
  gray-scale color marks the statistical significance.
