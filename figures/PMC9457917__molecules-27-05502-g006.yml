caption: Illustrations showing the associations after applying the statistical Pearson
  correlation test; (a) correlations between parameters and protein molecules belonging
  to the complement and coagulation cascade signaling pathway; (b) correlations between
  the clinical parameters and proteins involved in platelet degranulation pathway;
  (c) correlations between serum parameters and proteins involved in cholesterol metabolism
  signaling pathway and (d) correlations for prothrombotic factor proteins and clinical
  parameters. Pearson correlation coefficient is presented from 1 (most significant
  positive correlation) to âˆ’1 (most significant negative correlation).
