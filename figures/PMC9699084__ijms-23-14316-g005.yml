caption: Expression of ZmGLP1 in Arabidopsis increases resistance to PstDC3000. (A)
  Growth status of Arabidopsis leaves in different groups at four and seven weeks
  old. (B) Phenotypes of the different groups treated with PstDC3000 at 7 d. (C) The
  disease indexes of groups at 7 d. (D) The population density of bacteria of different
  groups. (E) H2O2 content of different groups at 3 d. (F) The expression levels of
  target plant genes of the salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, or ethephon pathway at
  24 h. AtActin2 and AtTUB4 were used as reference genes for normalization. (G) Trypan
  blue staining and DAB staining in Arabidopsis leaves of different groups at 3 d.
  Different letters in subfigures (C–F) indicated significant difference between different
  samples by Duncan’s post-hoc test. Data are presented as the mean ± SD based on
  three biological replicates.
