caption: MAP9 modulates EMT-related genes. (a) Western blotting was conducted to measure
  the levels of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin, and fibronectin proteins in the
  sh-ctrl and short hairpin ribonucleic acid- (RNA-) MAP9 (sh-MAP9) MAP9 cells. (b)
  Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay was used to analyze the interaction between
  MAP9 and E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin, and fibronectin. Data are presented as
  the mean ± standard deviation (SD), and paired Student's t-test was employed for
  data analysis. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
