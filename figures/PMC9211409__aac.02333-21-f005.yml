caption: Representation of enterococcal cell envelope synthesis and the DAP, FOS,
  and DF resistance pathway. Cell wall (CW) synthesis was started with the peptidoglycan
  precursor UDP-NAM pentapeptide, which was synthesized through the sequential action
  of MurA to MurF. UDP-NAM pentapeptide was then transferred to the lipid carrier
  C55P, forming lipid I, which was then used to form lipid II. Meanwhile, PG and cardiolipin,
  which are integral parts of cell membrane (CM) lipid, were synthesized through numerous
  precursors and various proteins, including those in the CDP-AP family. These two
  pathways were joined through the central metabolism pathway (, ). DAP resistance
  was mainly mediated by mutations to proteins involved in the membrane lipid synthesis
  pathway (blue dashed box), while FOS resistance was facilitated through mutations
  in the cell wall synthesis and central metabolism pathway (purple dashed box). Meanwhile,
  DF resistance was achieved independently through changes to both pathways separately
  (green dashed boxes). Created with Biorender.
