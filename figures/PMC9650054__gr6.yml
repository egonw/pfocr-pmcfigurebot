caption: 'The analysis of quantitative proteome and co-IP/MS.A, volcano plot of differentially
  expressed proteins in the ΔSEP068184 and WT strains. The color of the dot represents
  the adjusted p value. B, Venn diagram of significantly upregulated proteins from
  co-IP/MS proteomes with different tags. N- and C- means His and FLAG tags were fused
  at the N terminus and C terminus of SEP068184, respectively. C, KEGG pathway enrichment
  analysis of upregulated proteins in co-IP proteomes (adjusted p value <0.05, FC
  >1). y-axis indicates the pathway names of KEGG, and x-axis indicates the co-IP
  proteomes used different tags. The size of the bubble represents the number of genes
  ratio in each term. The color of the bubble represents the number of the q value.
  D, GO enrichment cellular component analysis of upregulated proteins in co-IP/MS
  proteomes. E, protein−protein interaction (PPI) network of 157 proteins in C. The
  PPI network of 157 proteins was constructed with interaction score >0.4. In the
  PPI network, clustering used MCL in STRING with inflation parameter setting to 4,
  and the node number in cluster was at least 3. Detailed information for quantitative
  proteome and co-IP MS analysis is listed in  and . F, pull-down binding assays for
  the interactions between Trx1 and SEP068184. Lanes 1 and 2 represent the purified
  Trx1 and SEP068184 that were loaded as the input. FLAG pull down was FLAG bead-bound
  proteins (lane 3: SEP068184; lane 4, Trx1; and lane 5: SEP0608184-Trx1); His pull
  down was nickel–nitrilotriacetic acid bead-bound proteins (lane 6: Trx1; lane 7,
  SEP068184; and lane 8: Trx1-SEP0608184). FC, fold change; GO, Gene Ontology; IP/MS,
  immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes;
  Trx1, thioredoxin 1.'
