figure_title: Canonical B cell phenotype frequencies vary with HIV status but still
  mount robust antibody-secreting cell (ASC) responses
caption: (A) Gating strategy to identify CD19+ B cells within the peripheral blood
  mononuclear cell (PBMC) compartment. B cells were further gated on CD27 and CD38
  to identify CD27+ Memory, CD27- Naïve, and CD27+CD38++ ASC. (B) Absolute B cell
  counts were calculated from patient total lymphocyte counts, followed by percent
  Naïve, Memory, and ASC fractions of the CD19+ parent population. These data represent
  the total combined frequencies over all time points per patient group. (C) The ASC
  response associated with SARS-CoV-2 viremia and was tracked longitudinally up to
  day 35 post diagnosis. Error bars indicate standard deviation (HIV- n = 37; HIV+
  n = 33). (D) A neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) served as a proxy of inflammation
  and associated with the ASC as well as plasmablast and plasma cell responses. Statistical
  analyses were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis H test for multiple comparisons
  and Mann-Whitney for SARS-CoV-2 viremia or NLR comparisons within groups. p Values
  are denoted by *≤0.05; **<0.01; ***<0.001, and ****<0.0001.
