figure_title: FASN regulates the c-Src/PI3K/AKT/FAK cascade via lipid rafts
caption: 'A, B Signaling pathway screening by various pathway inhibitors (Rapamycin-mTOR
  pathway inhibitor 50 nM, Y-27632-ROCK pathway inhibitor 30 µM, LY294002-PI3K/AKT
  pathway inhibitor 50 µM, PP2-c-SRC pathway inhibitor 10 mM) in HeLa and CaSki cells.
  C, D Western blot analysis of p-c-Src, c-Src, p-Akt, and Akt expression in the si-FASN
  (#1 and #2) and si-Ctrl groups. E Western blot analysis of p-c-Src, c-Src, p-Akt,
  and Akt expression in the C33A-FASN-OE and C33A-vector groups. F, G Rescue experiments
  by applying a c-Src overexpression plasmid (Src OE) and MβCD. p-Fak, Fak, p-Akt
  and Akt expression levels were detected and analyzed. H, I Rescue experiments by
  applying Akt overexpression plasmid (Akt OE) and MβCD. p-Fak, Fak, p-Akt, and Akt
  expression levels were detected and quantified. J Co-IP experiments were conducted
  to analyze the interaction between FASN and c-Src with or without a lipid raft inhibitor.
  Protein extracts were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FASN antibody and the immunoprecipitations
  were assayed for c-Src. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; #P < 0.05; ##P < 0.01;
  ###P < 0.001, MβCD + Src/Akt OE vs. MβCD + Vector.'
