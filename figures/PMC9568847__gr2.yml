caption: 'Multi-omics analysis of GSDMs in HCC (A) The copy number variation (CNV)
  alteration site of six GSDMs on 23 human chromosomes. We obtained the CNV frequencies
  of the six GSDMs in each HCC patient from an online exploration tool- UCSC Xena
  (http://xena.ucsc.edu/) []. The R package “Rcircos” was used to visualize the location
  of six GSDMs in human chromosomes (B) Differential expression of six GSDMs in normal
  and tumor samples of HCC (C, D) CNV variation frequency of six GSDMs in the TCGA-HCC
  cohort. The CNV was devided into two subtypes, homozygous CNV and heterozygous CNV,
  which represent the occurrence of CNV on both two chromosomes or only one. Percentage
  statistics based on subtypes of CNV used GISTIC processed CNV data, and calculation
  of correlation used mRNA RSEM data and raw CNV data (C) A red dot indicates amplification,
  and a blue dot indicates the deletion of CNV type (D) Horizontal coordinates represent
  the genetic alteration type of GSDMs, and the vertical coordinates represent the
  alteration frequency of CNV in each GSDM. Different rectangular blocks represent
  different mutation types. Brown, inframe mutation, green, missense mutation; orange,
  splice mutation; dark blue, truncating mutation; red, amplification; blue, deep
  deletion; grey, no alterations (E) The cancer-related signaling pathways are regulated
  by six GSDMs. Red indicates pathway activation; blue indicates pathway inhibition.
  GSCALite (http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/web/GSCALite/), a web-based analysis platform
  for gene-pooled cancer analysis [], was used to explore the GSDMs involved in the
  regulation of cancer-associated pathways (activation and inhibition). The pathway
  we included: Apoptosis pathways, Cell Cycle, DNA Damage Response, EMT, Hormone AR,
  Hormone ER, PI3K/AKT, RAS/MAPK, RTK, and TSC/mTOR. They are all famous cancer-related
  pathways. The Gene expression was divided into two groups (High and Low) through
  the median expression, student T-test was used to define the difference of pathway
  activity score (PAS) between two groups, p-value was adjusted by FDR, FDR≤0.05 is
  considered as significant. When PAS (Gene A in groupHigh) > PAS (Gene A in groupLow),
  we consider gene A might have an activating effect on a pathway, otherwise have
  an inhibiting effect on a pathway [] (F) Functional annotation analysis for six
  GSDMs through GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway analysis. We use the clusterProfiler
  package [version 3.14.3] to analyze the data, and the ggplot2 package [version 3.3.3]
  to visualize the results. The length of the bars in the bar graph from longest to
  shortest indicates the number of enriched genes from most to least. GO, Gene Ontology;
  blue indicates biological processes (BP); red presents cellular components (CC);
  green demonstrated molecular functions (MF), and sky blue presents Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG).'
