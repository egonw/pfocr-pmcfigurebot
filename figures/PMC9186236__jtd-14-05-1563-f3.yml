caption: 'The expression of the Wnt pathway marker proteins was affected by SOST.
  (A) The mRNA expression of the Wnt pathway marker genes, including Wnt1, β-catenin,
  APC, and GSK3β, was detected by qRT-PCR. (B) Western blot was used to detect the
  protein expression of Wnt1, β-catenin, APC, and GSK3β. GAPDH was used as the internal
  control. The data are presented as the mean ± SD (n=3). *P<0.05, SOST-overexpression
  group vs. control group; **P<0.01, SOST-overexpression group vs. control group;
  ##P<0.01, sh-SOST group vs. control group. SOST, sclerostin; sh, short hairpin;
  APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; qRT-PCR, quantitative
  real-time polymerase chain reaction; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  SD, standard deviation.'
