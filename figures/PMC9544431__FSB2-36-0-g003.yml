caption: Retinoic acid concentrations and mRNA expression levels of critical regulators
  of the retinoid metabolic pathway in the Bco2 −/−  mice. Retinoic acid (RA) concentrations
  were measured by LC–MS/MS in (A) whole heart, (B) liver, and (C) serum of 12‐14‐week‐old
  WT and Bco2 −/−  female mice (n = 3–5 mice/genotype). (D) Gene expression of Dhrs3,
  Rdh1, Rdh10, Lrat, Raldh1, Raldh2, Rarb, Cyp26a1, Cyp26b1 measured by real‐time
  RT‐PCR in the heart (left ventricles) of WT and Bco2 −/−  female mice (n = 4–6 mice/genotype).
  Values are expressed as mean ± SD and calculated using the 2−ΔΔCT  method. Statistical
  analysis by t‐test between genotypes within each tissue (A‐C) or gene (D); *p ≤ .05.
