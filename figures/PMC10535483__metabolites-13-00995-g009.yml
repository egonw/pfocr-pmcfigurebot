caption: 'Analysis of the metabolic pathways in rumen fluid from both RTW and HW groups
  is represented through pathway enrichment. The horizontal axis showcases the specific
  metabolic pathways, whereas the vertical axis illustrates the degree of enrichment.
  The varying shades of the bars depict the significance of each pathway’s enrichment,
  with deeper blue shades signifying more substantial enrichment within the KEGG annotations.
  Abbreviations in the KEGG annotation include: M for metabolism, EIP for environmental
  information processing, OS for organismal systems, GIP for genetic information processing,
  and HD for human diseases. The presence of asterisks on the bars indicates varying
  levels of significance. A single asterisk (*) stands for p < 0.05, two asterisks
  (**) stand for p ≤ 0.01, and three asterisks (***) stand for p ≤ 0.001. Sample size,
  n = 6.'
