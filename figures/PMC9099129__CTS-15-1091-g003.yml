caption: PD‐1 signaling cascade in T cells. The PD‐1 pathway is an important regulator
  of T cell activation, acting as a “brake” to modulate the T cell response. PD‐1
  activation inhibits signaling through both the nuclear factor kappa‐light‐chain‐enhancer
  of activated B cells (NF‐κB) and extracellular signal‐regulated kinase (ERK) pathways.
  This in turn leads to reduced cell proliferation and metabolism
