caption: Host factors contributing to JUNV replication, assembly and budding processes.
  The JUNV genome is enwrapped by multiple copies of the viral nucleoprotein (NP),
  forming viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNP), also known as nucleocapsids, which
  tightly associate to the viral L RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. They constitute the
  biologically active units for transcription of subgenomic viral messenger RNA (mRNA)
  as well as for viral genome replication. Both events take place in discrete puncta
  structures within the cytoplasm called replication–transcription complexes (RTCs).
  Several host factors, such as extracellular-signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2),
  inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2) and DEAD-box helicase 3 (DDX3)
  were described to contribute to JUNV RNA synthesis. The stress granule (SG)-associated
  Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP1), a phosphorylation-dependent
  endoribonuclease that modulates RNA metabolism, concentrates in cytoplasmic punctuated
  structures and colocalizes with NP, presumably being recruited to RTCs. Other targets,
  such as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), relocate to the cytoplasm,
  associate to NP and facilitate viral propagation. However, it is still not clear
  whether they specifically interfere in the viral replication step. JUNV translation
  also takes place in the cytoplasm and critically depends on eukaryotic initiation
  factor 4G (eIF4G) but displays a low dependence on the cap-binding initiation factor
  eIF4E. Glycoprotein precursor (GPC) intracellular transport through the ER–Golgi
  pathway is aided by host factors ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF-1), a GTP-binding
  protein involved in trafficking within the ER–Golgi complex, and ER–Golgi Intermediate
  Compartment 53 kDa protein (ERGIC-53), which functions as a cargo receptor for delivery
  of the GPC to budding sites. The adequate incorporation of GP into virions also
  depends on the lipid profile at the plasma membrane, affected by variations in the
  content of cholesterol and lipid-rafts microdomains. The viral Z matrix protein
  is the main force driving virus budding and release. This protein hijacks several
  host targets, such as IMPDH2 and the ATP-synthase ATP5B, to facilitate viral egress
  and complete the viral cycle. Components of the host endosomal sorting complex required
  for transport (ESCRT), including tumor susceptibility gene 101 protein (Tsg-101)
  and vacuolar protein sorting 4A or 4B (VPS4A/B), are also strictly required to sustain
  JUNV budding.
