figure_title: CRABP2, acting as downstream of RanGAP1, is affected by RanGAP1 at protein
  levels
caption: A Western blotting shows change of CRABP2 protein expression levels in RanGAP1
  knockdown and RanGAP1 overexpressed CRC cells. B RanGAP1 and CRABP2 proteins in
  xenografts from nude mice are analyzed by IHC (Fig. ). C–E IHC shows the relationship
  of RanGAP1 and CRABP2 protein expression in human colon cancer tissue microarray.
  F RanGAP1 and CRABP2 expression levels in CRC cells stably transfected with the
  shNC+Control, shRanGAP1+Control and shRanGAP1 + CRABP2 by western blotting. G–I
  The downtrend of proliferation, migration and invasion by shRanGAP1 of DLD1 were
  sectionally recurred because of CRABP2 overexpressing. J The protein expression
  levels associated with the MAPK signaling pathway were assessed in DLD1 cells stably
  transfected with shCRABP2.
