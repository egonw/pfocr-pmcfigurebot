caption: Kindlin-2-mediated PI3K/AKT pathway protects chondrocytes against IL­1beta-induced
  inflammation. (a, b) Knockdown of Kindlin-2 or inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
  in chondrocytes increased IL-1beta-induced chondrocyte apoptosis, as detected by
  Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and flow cytometry. Quantitative evaluation of Annexin
  V-FITC/PI staining results was performed. Values are expressed as mean ± s.d., ∗∗∗p
  < 0.001, ns indicates no significance. (c, d) Inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
  in Kindlin-2 OE chondrocytes in the direct contact coculture system increased IL-1beta-induced
  chondrocyte apoptosis, as detected by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and flow cytometry.
  Quantitative evaluation of Annexin V-FITC/PI staining results was performed. Values
  are expressed as mean ± s.d., ∗∗∗p < 0.001. (e, f) Knockdown of Kindlin-2 or inhibition
  of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in chondrocytes further reduced mitochondrial membrane
  potential induced by IL-1beta, as detected by JC-1 dye and flow cytometry. Quantitative
  evaluation of the percentage of collapsed mitochondrial membrane potential is expressed
  as mean ± s.d., ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ns indicates no significance. (g, h) Inhibition of
  PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in Kindlin-2 OE chondrocytes in the direct contact coculture
  system reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential induced by IL-1beta, as detected
  by JC-1 dye and flow cytometry. Quantitative evaluation of the percentage of collapsed
  mitochondrial membrane potential is expressed as mean ± s.d., ∗∗∗p < 0.001. (i)
  Knockdown of Kindlin-2 or inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in chondrocytes
  increased ROS levels induced by IL-1beta, as determined by DCHDA assay. Values are
  expressed as mean ± s.d., ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ns indicates no significance. (j) Inhibition
  of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in Kindlin-2 OE chondrocytes in the direct contact coculture
  system increased ROS levels induced by IL-1beta, as determined by DCHDA assay. Values
  are expressed as mean ± s.d., ∗∗∗p < 0.001.
