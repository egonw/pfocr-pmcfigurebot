caption: 'TQ significantly inhibited the expression of CALR, NLRP3 and PYCARD in PBMCs
  of TNBC patients. (A–C) CALR expression versus TQ concentrations. PBMCs isolated
  from TNBC patients were treated with TQ (0, 20, 50, and 100 µM) for (A) 24 h, (B)
  48 h, and (C) 72 h. (D–F) NLRP3 expression versus TQ concentrations. PBMCs isolated
  from TNBC patients were treated with TQ (0, 20, 50, and 100 µM) for (D) 24 h, (E)
  48 h, and (F) 72 h. (G–I) PYCARD expression versus TQ concentrations. PBMCs isolated
  from TNBC patients were treated with TQ (0, 20, 50, and 100 µM) for (G) 24 h, (H)
  48 h, and (I) 72 h. All experiments were performed in triplicate and data were expressed
  as the mean ± standard deviation. Statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad
  Prism software version 9.1.1. The data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s
  multiple comparisons to compare each treated column and the DMSO control column
  (**** p value< 0.0001; ** p value < 0.01; * p < 0.05). TQ: thymoquinone; CALR: calreticulin;
  NLRP3: NOD-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3);
  PYCARD: PYD and CARD domain containing; PBMCs: peripheral blood mononuclear cells;
  TNBC: triple-negative breast cancer; BC: breast cancer; DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide;
  ns: non-significant.'
