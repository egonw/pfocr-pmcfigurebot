caption: 'Fibrinogen-related cellular receptors and signaling molecules in the CNS.
  Fibrinogen plays a critical role in neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and myelin
  damage by binding to receptors on various cells within the nervous system. The interactions
  with astrocytes, neurons, microglia, OLs, and Schwann cells trigger downstream signaling
  pathways that worsen neuroinflammatory processes, oxidative stress, and cellular
  demise. Specifically, when fibrinogen binds to astrocytes, it activates the Smad
  pathway. This activation leads to the release of inflammatory factors and suppression
  of neurite growth. Similarly, binding to neurons activates the EGFR, inhibiting
  neurite growth, and triggers the NF-κB pathway, upregulating the levels of CCL2
  and IL6, which result in neuronal death. During its conversion to fibrin, fibrinogen
  exposes the γ377–395 epitope. This epitope binds to the CD11b/CD18 integrin receptor
  on microglia, promoting the release of ROS and NO, triggering the signaling cascade
  of the Akt, RhoA, and PI3K pathways, and increasing the levels of CCL2 and CXCL10.
  Activation of these signaling molecules exacerbates neuroinflammation and demyelination.
  Furthermore, fibrinogen’s interaction with OLs increases phosphorylation of the
  BMP signal transducers Smad1/5, impeding myelin regeneration. Its interaction with
  Schwann cells, on the other hand, stimulates the ERK pathway, also impeding myelin
  regeneration. P-Smad, phosphorylated mad homolog; P-EGFR, phosphorylated epidermal
  growth factor receptor; P-Akt, phosphorylated serine/threonine-protein kinase; The
  integrin receptors: αvβ3, αvβ8; ACVR1, activin A receptor type 1; NF-κB, nuclear
  factor-κB.'
