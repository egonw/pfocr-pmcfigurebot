caption: The effect of solamargine on the metastasis of cervical cancer cells and
  its potential mechanism related to the Erk pathway. (a) Scratch test was performed
  to assess the migration of tumor cells under 0, 5, and 10 μM solamargine treatment
  after 24 h (×100 magnification, scale bar = 100 μm). (b) Transwell assay was used
  to measure the invasion of solamargine-treated cells (×250 magnification, scale
  bar = 50 μm). (c) Following exposure to solamargine, western blot was conducted
  to detect p-Erk1/2 and Erk1/2 protein levels. GAPDH served as the loading control.
  (d, e) qRT-PCR was performed to detect the expression of PBK, RACK1, CXCL3, TRIP4,
  and SEMA3C in solamargine-treated cells. GAPDH served as the internal control. (f,
  g) Western blot was conducted to detect the protein expression of CXCL3 in solamargine-treated
  cells. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001 vs. 0 μM. h, hours; Erk, extracellular
  regulated protein kinases; p, phosphorylated; qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time polymerase
  chain reaction; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PBK, PDZ binding
  kinase; RACK1, receptor for activated C kinase 1; CXCL3, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand
  3; TRIP4, thyroid hormone receptor interactor 4; SEMA3C, semaphorin 3C.
