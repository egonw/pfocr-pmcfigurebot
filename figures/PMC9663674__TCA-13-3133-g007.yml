caption: Circ‐EIF3I regulated LC cell progression by sponging miR‐1253. A549 and H1299
  cells were transfected with si‐NC, si‐circ‐EIF3I, si‐circ‐EIF3I + anti‐miR‐NC or
  si‐circ‐EIF3I + anti‐miR‐1253. (a) MiR‐1253 expression was determined using qRT‐PCR.
  The viability, colony number, apoptosis, migration and invasion of cells were detected
  using MTT assay (b), (c), colony formation assay (d), flow cytometry (e), and transwell
  assay (f), (g). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001. LC, lung cancer;
  qRT‐PCR, quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction
article_title: Circ‐EIF3I facilitates proliferation, migration, and invasion of lung
  cancer via regulating the activity of Wnt/β‐catenin pathway through the miR‐1253/NOVA2
  axis.
