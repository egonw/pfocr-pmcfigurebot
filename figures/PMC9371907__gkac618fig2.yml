caption: Disruption of the TLR9 signaling pathway leads to reduced immune responses
  for non-CpG PS-ASOs. (A) Relative qRT-PCR levels of CCL22 mRNA in either control
  Luciferase or UNC93B1-targeted siRNA treated Bjab cells following incubation of
  indicated PS-ASOs at 1.6 μM in serum-free RPMI media by free-uptake for 8 h (left)
  or 4 h (middle). Relative qRT-PCR levels of UNC93B1 mRNA for indicated Bjab cells
  shown to the right. (B) RFU of TLR9 activation for either control Luciferase or
  UNC93B-targeted siRNA in 293-TLR9 cells treated with the indicated PS-ASOs for 16
  h. Relative qRT-PCR levels of UNC93B mRNA for indicated 293-TLR9 cells shown to
  the right. (C) Relative qRT-PCR levels of CCL22 mRNA in either control Luciferase
  or MyD88-targeted siRNA Bjab cells following 16 h incubation of indicated PS-ASOs
  at 1.6 μM in serum-free RPMI media by free-uptake. Relative qRT-PCR levels of MyD88
  mRNA for indicated Bjab cells shown to the right. (D) RFU of TLR9 activation for
  either control Luciferase or MyD88-targeted siRNA in 293-TLR9 cells treated with
  the indicated PS-ASOs for 16 h. Relative qRT-PCR levels of MyD88 mRNA for indicated
  293-TLR9 cells shown to the right. (E) Relative qRT-PCR levels of CCL22 mRNA in
  Bjab cells following 8 h incubation with the indicated PS-ASOs at 1.6 μM in serum-free
  RPMI media by free-uptake with the indicated amount of Chloroquine added. (F) Relative
  qRT-PCR levels of CCL22 mRNA in Bjab cells following 16 h incubation with the indicated
  PS-ASOs at 1.6 μM in serum-free RPMI media by free-uptake with the indicated amount
  of Chloroquine added. (G) RFU of TLR9 activation for 293-TLR9 cells treated with
  the indicated PS-ASOs incubated with the indicated amount of chloroquine for 16
  h. Error bars are standard deviations from at least three independent experiments.
  P-values were calculated based on unpaired t-test and were computed comparing with
  control (WT or Luciferase) samples. ***P < 0.001; **P < 0.01; *P < 0.05; ns, not
  significant.
