caption: SH3BP5-AS1 was upregulated in GEM-treated PDX pancreatic cancer and its upregulation
  was negatively correlated with overall survival. A Establishment of the PDX pancreatic
  cancer model and experimental workflow of GEM treatment. B Heatmap displaying the
  top 10 upregulated lncRNAs in GEM-treated and control PDX mice. C Correlation analysis
  of SH3BP5-AS1 and clinicopathological features based on the TCGA database. D SH3BP5-AS1
  was upregulated in pancreatic cancer tumor tissues compared with the paired adjacent
  tissues, as revealed by RT-qPCR. E SH3BP5-AS1 is an independent risk factor for
  the prognosis of pancreatic cancer, as revealed by ROC curve analysis. F Upregulation
  of SH3BP5-AS1 was correlated with poor overall survival. G SH3BP5-AS1 expression
  was significantly higher in pancreatic cancer cells compared with HPDE6-C7 cells.
  Data are shown as the mean ± SD. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01
