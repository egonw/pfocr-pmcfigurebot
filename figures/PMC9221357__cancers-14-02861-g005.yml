caption: The autophagy induced by the IFI35 knockdown was dependent on the STAT1/STAT6
  phosphorylation pathway in renal cancer cells. IFI35 knockdown Ketr-3 or 786-O cells
  were treated with or without inhibitor fludarabine (5 μmol/L) or AS1517499 (100
  nmol/L). (A,B) Forty-eight hours after inhibitor treatment, the levels of pSTAT1
  or pSTAT6 were detected by flow cytometry in IFI35 knockdown renal cancer cells.
  (C,D) Statistical analysis of the levels of pSTAT1 or pSTAT6 was represented in
  (A,B). (E,G) Forty-eight hours after inhibitor treatment, the expression of LC3-I
  and LC3-II were detected by Western blot in IFI35 knockdown renal cancer cells.
  (F,H) The panels represent the statistical analysis of the band intensity through
  densitometric estimation of each band normalized by GAPDH in (E,G). Data are from
  one representative experiment of three performed and presented as the mean ± SD,
  cell samples, n ≥ 3. The different significance was set at ** p < 0.01, and ***
  p < 0.001. Original blots see .
