caption: Changes in the expression of CYT C1 and AKT in RPE cells under GE treatment
  and hyperglycemia. (A) WB was used to detect CYT C1 and AKT expression in cells
  of each group; (B,C) WB was used to detect the expression changes of CYT C1 and
  AKT in each group after high glucose combined with GE treatment under hyperglycemia
  (**P<0.05). GE, genipin; RPE, retinal pigment epithelial; WB, western blot.
article_title: Genipin protects against mitochondrial damage of the retinal pigment
  epithelium under hyperglycemia through the AKT pathway mediated by the miR-4429/JAK2
  signaling axis.
