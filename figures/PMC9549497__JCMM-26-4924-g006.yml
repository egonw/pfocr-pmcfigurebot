caption: 'RNA sequencing results on T‐cell functions and pathways of CD SubQ vs CD
  Mes (n = 3). (A) Normalized FPKM z‐score heat map of differentially expressed genes
  in for the function ‘Infiltration of T Cells’. (B) Activation z‐score heat map of
  selected ‘Diseases and Functions’ and ‘Canonical Pathways’. (C) Canonical pathway
  of T‐cell receptor signalling. CD SubQ vs CD Mes differentially expressed genes
  highlighted in pink. Node colours represent fold change. Red: upregulated, Green:
  downregulated and Grey: expressed'
