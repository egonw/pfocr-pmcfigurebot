caption: 'ZFP64 promotes gallbladder cancer proliferation, migration, and invasion
  in vitro via activating Notch1 signaling pathway. Control or ZFP64 overexpressing
  GBC-SD and NOZ cells were treated with or without DAPT at 100 μM for 24 h. (A) Western
  blot assays were used to analyze protein levels related to Notch1 signaling pathway.
  (B) Immunofluorescence assays were conducted to analyze the expression level of
  NICD. NICD: green fluorescent; DAPI-stained nuclei: blue fluorescent. (C) The ability
  of anti-apoptosis, proliferation, and EMT of GBC cells were detected using Western
  blot assays. (D) The proliferation capacity of GBC cells was determined using EdU
  assays. EdU positive cell: red fluorescent; DAPI-stained nuclei: blue fluorescent.
  (E) The migration and invasion were detected and counted using transwell assays.
  All data were assessed using one-way ANOVA, as mean ± SD, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001. See  for original western blots.'
