figure_title: PVT1 is regulated by YAP1
caption: '(A) Immunofluorescence of YAP1 under low and high density seeding in SK-OV3
  cells (scale bar = 100 μm). (B) Quantification of the ratio of nuclear YAP to total
  YAP measured as an average intensity of total YAP in the nucleus/total YAP in the
  cell (unpaired two-tailed t test: number of cells = minimum 70 cells per biological
  trial, P = 0.0005; N = 3). (C) RT-qPCR of CTGF and CYR61 mRNA expression of cells
  grown in indicated cell densities normalized to levels in low density (unpaired
  two-tailed t test: CYR61, P < 0.0001; CTGF, P = 0.0084; N = 3). (D, E) RT-qPCR of
  (D) PVT1 or (E) indicated genes in cells grown under different matrix rigidity conditions
  normalized to levels of normal plastic plates (GPa) (two-way ANOVA-Tukey multiple
  testing; N = 3). (F) RT-qPCR of PVT1 RNA from cells grown at low density and under
  either full serum or serum starvation as indicated, normalized to levels under full
  serum (two-way ANOVA-Sidak’s multiple testing; –N = 2; exon 1–2, P = 0.0102; exon
  2–3, P = 0.0068; exon 6–7, P = 0.0251). (G) RT-qPCR of indicated YAP1 target genes
  (CTGF and CYR61) of cells grown at low density and under either full serum or serum
  starvation as indicated, normalized to levels under full serum (two-way ANOVA-Sidak
  multiple testing: CTGF, P = 0.0009; CYR61, P = 0.0011; N = 2). (H) RT-qPCR of PVT1
  RNA in shRNA YAP1 or Ctrl vector cells normalized to levels in Ctrl vector cells
  (two-way ANOVA-Sidak multiple testing: exon 1–2, P = 0.0199; YAP1, P = 0.0258; N
  = 2). (I) RT-qPCR of PVT1 RNA expression in cells treated with 5 μM of Verteporfin
  or DMSO control normalized to levels in DMSO-treated cells (two-way ANOVA-Sidak
  multiple testing: exon 1–2, P < 0.0001; exon 2–3, P = 0.0002; exon 6–7, P = 0.0153;
  N = 3). (J) Correlation analysis of PVT1 expression with gene ontology of Hippo
  signaling pathway (z-score: value indicates the number of standard deviations away
  from the mean of mRNA expression in all profiled samples). Error bars are indicated
  as SEM. P-values are reported as ≥ 0.05 (ns), 0.01–0.05 (*), 0.001–0.01 (**), 0.0001–0.001
  (***), and < 0.0001 (****).Source data are available for this figure.'
