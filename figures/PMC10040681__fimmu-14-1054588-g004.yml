caption: Proteomic analysis on PHX treated M1 macrophages reveal downregulation in
  immune signalling and RNA metabolism. (A) Volcano plot showing statistically significant
  upregulated (red) and downregulated (blue) proteins in 5 μM PHX treated M1 macrophages.
  (B) Network analysis based on protein-protein interactions (PPI) of 433 significantly
  downregulated proteins in PHX treated M1 macrophages. The k-means clustering identified
  3 clusters with distinct Reactome Knwoledgbase pathway associated proteins. (C)
  Box plot comparing relative protein expression of identified mTOR signalling proteins
  between vehicle or PHX treated M1 macrophages. Student’s unpaired t-tests.
