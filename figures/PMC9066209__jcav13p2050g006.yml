caption: CuI inhibited the growth of PDAC tumor xenografts in vivo. (A) Images of
  control group, low-dose (CuI 1mg/kg) and high-dose (CuI 1mg/kg) tumor-bearing mice.
  (B) Tumor masses from the control group, from the low-dose group and the high-dose
  group. (C) Measured the length and width every 3 days to calculate the volume of
  the tumor from day 0 to day 30 after injected two weeks. (D) Measured the weight
  of mice every 3 days. (E) CuI induced a decrease of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 protein levels
  in mice tumor. (F) The expressions of PCNA in xenograft tumors were analyzed by
  immunohistochemistry.
