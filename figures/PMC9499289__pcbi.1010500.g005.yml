figure_title: Human fMRI confirms computational advantage of transthalamic routing
  of cortical information suggested by neural model
caption: We considered a Bayesian model capturing computations in the OFC that detected
  context changes and cued the dlPFC-MD neural model to switch behavioral strategy
  accordingly. Two nodes of the Bayesian model represented belief in current context
  (predominantly match or non-match context). Context nodes associated through Hebbian
  learning to neurons in MD or dlPFC that happened to be active. When the OFC model
  detected a switch, it activated the appropriate node for the inferred context, thereby
  activating dlPFC or MD neurons associated with it. A. The OFC switch signal enhanced
  performance immediately after a block change, and both sending the OFC signal to
  dlPFC or through a transthalamic route to MD performed comparably. B. Average performance
  in the 30 trials after a switch shows comparable enhancement in performance in the
  model with OFC sending switch signal to MD or to dlPFC, compared with model with
  no OFC signaling (paired t-test, MD vs dlPFC p = 0.6, dlPFC vs OFC off ***p <0.0001,
  and MD vs OFC off ***p <0.0001). C. The transthalamic pathway required OFC to activate
  only the 1 of the 2 MD neurons, whereas lowering the number of dlPFC neurons receiving
  signal immediately deteriorated performance. D. We varied the number of timesteps
  within a trial that OFC input needed to be active, and the transthalamic path required
  shorter duration signal to achieve ceiling performance. E. Turning to human fMRI
  analysis, Bayesian model selection from fMRI data revealed that the causal pattern
  with connection from OFC to MD rather than to dlPFC was superior in explaining the
  difference between trials where humans switched strategy or stayed in the same strategy
  (model posterior probability = 0.99, for all model comparisons see ). F. Modulation
  of connectivity in Switching from fMRI data. Green connections represent positive
  modulation, red connections represent negative modulation. The number alongside
  the connections indicate the coupling parameters from Bayesian parameter averaging,
  which represents the strength of effective connectivity in Hz.
