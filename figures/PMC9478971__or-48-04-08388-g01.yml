caption: Functional role of c-Met in the metastasis and invasion of PCa cell lines.
  (A) Detection of the siRNA-mediated knockdown of c-Met in PC3 and DU145 cells by
  real-time PCR and western blotting. (B) The expression of c-Met, E-cadherin and
  N-cadherin was determined by western blotting after c-Met knockdown and HGF (50
  ng/ml) stimulation in the PC3 and DU145 cells. (C and D) Transwell assays of the
  effects of c-Met silencing and HGF (50 ng/ml) on the migratory and invasive potentials
  of the PC3 and DU145 cells. (E) Morphological changes of PC3 and DU145 cells stimulated
  by HGF (50 ng/ml) and foretinib. (F and G) HGF (50 ng/ml) induced cell scattering
  in the PC3 and DU145 cells. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001; NS, not significant.
