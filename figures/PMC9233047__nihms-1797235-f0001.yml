figure_title: αβT lymphocyte maturation and most common theories about the origin
  of DN T cells in periphery
caption: The development of murine αβT cells in thymus physiologically includes DN
  stages 1–4 of thymocytes that are defined by the expression of CD44+ and CD25+.
  To describe the development of mature TCRαβ+ double negative (DN) T cells in periphery,
  there are five theories. According to theory 1 CD4+ or CD8+ down regulate their
  coreceptor in the periphery to become DN T cells , Theory 2 hypothesizes hematopoietic
  stem cells go directly from bone marrow and mature into DN T cells in the periphery.,
  Theory 3 suggest that DN4 stage to DP transition in thymus was never completed and
  DN T cells traveled to periphery. Theory 4 suggests an alternate pathway through
  the thymus. According to theory 5, peripheral DN T cells are a pool of heterogenous
  cells with different origins. Peripheral DN T cells have been found in steady-state
  and diseased organ tissue. Of important note, stages of TCR γ and δ selection is
  currently unclear, however, it is known their arrangement occurs prior to TCR α
  and β selection during the DN stage.,
