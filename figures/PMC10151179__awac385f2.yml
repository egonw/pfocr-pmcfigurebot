caption: Voxel-wise differences in MD between diagnostic groups and controls (cingulum
  pathway), controlling for age and sex. The cingulum pathway showed significantly
  higher MD values in the posterior/retrosplenial cingulate already in the SCD group
  compared with the HC group. Additional differences were present in the rostral and
  dorsal anterior cingulate in MCI and Alzheimer’s disease dementia groups. Voxel-wise
  analyses of the diffusion data (MD values) were performed using non-parametric permutation
  testing. Identification of significant clusters in the data was performed using
  TFCE. Significance maps were corrected for multiple comparisons using a familywise
  error rate of P < 0.05 (non-significant voxels are shown in green). BF mask (in
  purple) was inflated for illustrative purposes. AD = Alzheimer’s disease dementia.
