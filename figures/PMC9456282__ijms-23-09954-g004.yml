caption: Effect of caffeine on NF-κB (p65) level, proinflammatory cytokines, and NLRP3
  of hepatic tissue from the NASH model. (A) Representative IHC images of p65, NLRP3,
  and caspase 1 of hepatic tissues from rats in the control, HFSCD+CCl4, HFSCD+CCl4+caffeine,
  and caffeine groups. Scale bar = 50 μm and 20 μm. Percentage of positive area for
  p65 (B), NLRP3 (C), and caspase 1 (D) obtained from IHC slices (n = 4). Arrows indicate
  a positive label. Levels of p65 (E), interleukin (IL)-1β (F), IL-17 (G), and TNF-α
  (H). Proteins in hepatic tissues were detected using western blot analysis (n =
  3). β-Actin was used as a loading control. Values are presented as fold increments
  in optical density normalized to control group values (control = 1). Bars represent
  the mean ± SEM. (a) p < 0.05 compared with the control group; (b) p < 0.05 compared
  with the HFSCD+CCl4 group.
