caption: Underlying immune escape mechanisms in high-IRR TNBC patients. (A) Correlation
  analyses for ntAI, LOH, LST, HRD and TMB with the IRR score. (B, C) GSEA showed
  KEGG pathways enriched in the low-IRR (B) and high-IRR groups (C). (D) Ridge plots
  showing HALLMARK signature differences identified by GSEA between the low-IRR and
  high-IRR groups. (E) GSEA showed that the glycolysis pathway was enriched in the
  high-IRR group versus the low-IRR group. (F) Comparison of the expression levels
  of glycolytic pathway-associated genes in the high- and low-IRR groups. (G-J) The
  expression differences in cGAS-STING pathway-associated genes in the high- and low-IRR
  groups. (K) Correlation analysis of the IRR score with the expression levels of
  immune checkpoint and HLA family genes.
