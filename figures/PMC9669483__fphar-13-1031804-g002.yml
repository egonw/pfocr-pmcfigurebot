caption: (A) Weekly changes in mechanical withdrawal thresholds in the left gastrocnemius
  muscle of rats were measured with the RandallSelitto device. The mechanical withdrawal
  threshold decreases from week three until it remains low at week 12. Data are presented
  as the mean values ±standard deviation. (B) H&E staining of the MTrPs model of rats
  muscle fibers cross-sections with light microscopy (x 400). (a) Normal muscle fibers
  have a uniform size and a polygonal shape. (b) Deeply stained round muscle fibers
  with central nucleus of variable size were seen in the MTrPs group. (C). The mRNA
  expression of MEF2C in the MTrPs group was higher than that in the control group,
  using GAPDH as the internal reference mRNA. (D). MEF2C protein expression was significantly
  higher in the MTrPs group, with GAPDH as the internal reference protein. *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01.
