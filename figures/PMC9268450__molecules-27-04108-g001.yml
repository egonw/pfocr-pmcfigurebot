caption: The analysis of DEGs. (A,B) DEGs were defined between primary NSCLC and metastatic
  NSCLC. A total of 1648 DEGs (506 upregulated DEGs and 1142 downregulated DEGs) were
  defined between primary NSCLC and metastatic NSCLC. In the heatmap (A), red color
  represented primary NSCLC and blue color represented metastatic NSCLC. In the volcano
  plot (B), red dot represented upregulated DEGs and green dot represented downregulated
  DEGs, the two dashed horizontal lines mark the positions of p-value = 0.05 and p-value
  = 0.0001, respectively, and the 4 vertical dotted lines mark the positions of log2
  foldchange (logFC) = −1.5, logFC = −0.3, logFC = 0.3 and logFC = 1.5, respectively.
  (C, D) GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. DEGs enriched in regulation of peptidase
  activity, extracellular matrix enzyme inhibitor activity and amyotrophic lateral
  sclerosis significantly. NSCLC, Non-small cell lung cancer; SD, Standard deviation.
