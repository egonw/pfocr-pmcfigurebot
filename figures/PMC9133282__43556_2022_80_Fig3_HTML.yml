caption: Differential RNA-splicing and protein-protein interactions associated with
  cancer and metastasis were enriched in the F1 and F2 populations compared to parental
  population. a A volcano plot of the 526 differentially spliced transcripts. b Overall,
  43 genes were both significantly differentially expressed and differentially spliced.
  c Gene-disease association analysis using DisGeNET revealed differentially spliced
  genes associated with mammary neoplasms. d KEGG pathway analysis identified differentially
  spliced genes included within the Pathways in Cancer geneset. e BIRC5 was one of
  the few genes that was both differentially expressed and differentially spliced.
  The three spliced variants of BIRC5 differentially spliced in the F1 and F2 populations
  are shown
