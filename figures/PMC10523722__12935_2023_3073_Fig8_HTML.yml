caption: Cancer progression was inhibited by Silencing FAP in an animal model of ccRCC
  xenografts. A The xenograft tumors were excised from the nude mice of each group
  after sacrifice. B The final weight of tumors was analysed. C Changes of the tumor
  volume in each group were monitored every 7 days. D The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway protein
  content in xenograft tumor tissues were examined using western blot analysis. *p < 0.05

  the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
