caption: miR-107 is negatively regulated by TTN-AS1. A. The predicted binding site
  between TTN-AS1 and miR-107. B. Luciferase assay results demonstrated direct binding
  of TTN-AS1 and miR-107. C. MiR-107 was expressed at lower levels in MCF-7/TAM versus
  MCF-7. D, E. QRT-PCR results indicate miR-107 is negatively regulated by TTN-AS1.
  All data are represented as mean Â± SD. Each assay was performed in triplicate. **P
  < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
