caption: 'RNA-seq data shows differential gene expressions upon treatment with DAC,
  DEX, or in the combination of DAC and DEX in MDA-MB-231 cells(A) RNA-seq analysis
  of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with DMSO, DAC, DEX, or both drugs for 6 days. Volcano
  plot showing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from different treatment conditions.
  Significantly DEGs (fold change>2) are highlighted in different colors (red for
  upregulated genes and blue for downregulated genes) with p < 0.05.(B and C) Transcriptome
  data from DEX+DAC versus DMSO controls (B) or DAC versus DMSO control (C), were
  further analyzed using GSEA based on the latest MSigDB database for each collection.
  GSEA revealed the enrichment of genes associated with apoptosis, the TNFα signaling
  pathway, the p53 pathway, and the estrogen response. Significantly DEGs (fold change > 2)
  are highlighted in different colors (red for upregulated genes and blue for downregulated
  genes) with p < 0.05.(D) Model visualization for drug interaction analysis to compare
  the gene expression across all treatments. If there is no interaction, the drug
  effects for DAC and DEX combined treatment will result solely from the addition
  of a single-drug effect. If there is positive interaction between DAC: DEX, the
  drug effects for DAC and DEX combined treatment will result in synergistic enhancement
  or inhibition. If there is negative interaction between DAC: DEX, the drug effects
  for DAC and DEX combined treatment will result in the antagonistic effect.(E) Volcano
  plot of all genes with positive (shown as red) or negative (shown as blue) interactions
  of the two drugs (DAC: DEX; p < 0.05). Y axes represent the logarithm (base-10)
  of the p value of each coefficient of interaction. X axes represent the coefficients
  of interaction.(F) GO pathway analysis from the top 100 genes ranking by the score
  of coefficients with negative interactions (Left) or positive interactions (Right)
  by DAC and DEX.'
