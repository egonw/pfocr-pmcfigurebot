caption: LPH stimulated osteoblast differentiation through p38/Runx2 pathway. (A,B)
  Effect of MAPK and Akt signaling specific inhibitors on LPH-induced ALP activity
  and Runx2 expression in MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts. Cells were seeded on six-well plates
  until confluency and were serum-starved in α-MEM for 12 h. Then cells were individually
  pretreated with or without 5 μM SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor), 5 μM FR180204 (ERK1/2
  MAPK inhibitor), and 2.5 μM ADZ5363 (Akt inhibitor) for 2 h, prior to coincubation
  with 500 μg/mL of LPH for 24 h to detect (A) ALP activity and (B) Runx2 expression.
  (C,D) Effect of Runx2 knockdown on LPH-induced ALP activity and Runx2 expression
  in MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts. Cells were seeded on six-well plates until 50% confluency
  and were transfected with Runx2 siRNA or control (Ctrl) siRNA for 48 h, prior to
  coincubation with 500 μg/mL of LPH for 24 h to detect (C) ALP activity and (D) Runx2
  expression. The expression of α/β-tubulin was used as the loading control to Runx2.
  Data are represented as the mean ± SEM, n = 3. % and %%% indicate p < 0.05 and p
  < 0.001, as compared to the control group. *, ** and *** indicate p < 0.05, p <
  0.01 and p < 0.001, as compared to the LPH treated group. N.S. indicated p > 0.05.
  N.S. indicated p > 0.05.
