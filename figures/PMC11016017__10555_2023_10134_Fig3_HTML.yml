caption: 'Flavonoids as potential inhibitors of the NF-κB pathway, which may act as
  sensitizers of the chemoresistant BC and/or chemopreventive agents. Selected flavonoids
  can overcome BC chemoresistance by blocking TME, ABC transporters, crucial signaling
  pathways, CSCs, growth factors, and DNA damage and via inducing p53 activity, apoptosis,
  autophagy, and cell cycle arrest. Abbreviations: BC, breast carcinoma; TME, tumor
  microenvironment; NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappa B; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth
  factor; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinases; MMPs, matrix metallopeptidases; IL, interleukin;
  TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; MDR, multi-drug resistance; MRP1, multidrug resistance-associated
  protein 1; AKT, protein kinase B; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinases; ROS,
  reactive oxygen species; DSB, double-strand breaks; SSB, single-strand breaks; ATR,
  ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia mutated
  protein; PARP-1, poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition;
  ABCB1, multi-drug resistance protein 1 (MDR-1); P-gp, P-glycoprotein; CSCs, cancer
  stem cells; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; FOXO3, forkhead box O3; JNK, c-Jun
  N-terminal kinase; p38, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JAK, Januse kinase; STAT,
  signal transducer and activator of transcription; Nrp 1, neuropilin-1; TLRs, Toll-like
  receptors; TGF-β, transforming growth factor beta; RANKL, receptor activator of
  nuclear factor-κB ligand; IKKα, IκB kinase α; OCT4, octamer-binding transcription
  factor 4; ALDH1, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1; SOX2, SRY-box transcription factor 2;
  NANOG, NANOG homeobox; CD44, cluster of differentiation 44; ABC, ATP binding cassette'
