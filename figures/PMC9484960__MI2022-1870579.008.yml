caption: 'NLRP3 overexpression or NF-κB activation reversed the effects of LMX1B silence
  on SW1353 cell biology. (a) CCK-8 analysis for SW1353 cell survival; (b) 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine
  (EdU) assay was used to determine SW1353 cell proliferation; (c) SW1353 cell apoptosis
  was detected by using flow cytometer analysis. (d) ELISA kits were used to determine
  the expression of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, and PGE2; (e) NO and PGE2 concentration was
  determined by the Griess reaction and ELISA kit, respectively; (f) ELISA kits were
  used to determine the expression of MMP3 and MMP13. SW1353 cells were transfected
  with LMX1B siRNA for 24 h by using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent and then treated with
  10 ng/ml IL-1β for 24 h or SW1353 cells were cotransfected with LMX1B siRNA and
  pcDNA3.1 control vector or LMX1B siRNA and pcDNA3.1-NLRP3 vector for 24 h and then
  treated with 10 ng/ml IL-1β for 24 h, or SW1353 cells were treated with 10 ng/ml
  IL-1β and LPS (400 μg/ml) for 24 h. ∗P < 0.05, compared with the IL-1β group; #P
  < 0.05, compared with the IL-1β+LMX1B siRNA group. All experiments were repeated
  three times.'
