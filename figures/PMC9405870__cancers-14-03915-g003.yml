caption: FAM107A exhibits low expression in prostate cancer cells due to hypermethylation
  of its promoter region. (A) cg04992588, cg24659328, cg2615468, and cg01446993 were
  used as probes to detect the promoter methylation level of the FAM107A gene in normal
  and tumor tissues (http://www.bioinfo-zs.com/smartapp/ (accessed on 1 June 2022)).
  (B) cg04992588, cg24659328, cg2615468, and cg01446993 probes were negatively correlated
  with FAM107A gene expression. (C) Growth inhibitory effect of different concentrations
  of 5-Aza on prostate cancer cells. (D) The methylation region of the promoter (CpG
  island) of the primer. (E) MSP analysis of the methylation status of the FAM107A
  promoter before and after 5-azacytidine treatment. “ U “indicates amplification
  without methylation, and” M “indicates amplification with methylation. (F) 5-Aza
  treatment rescues the mRNA expression of FAM107A. (G) Effect of 5-azacytidine on
  FAM107A protein expression in prostate cancer cells by Western blotting. (H)Analysis
  of the effects of 5-Aza and FAM107A siRNA on cell proliferation according to a CCK8
  assay. (I) Correlation between FAM107A and DNMT1 was analyzed using the prostate
  cancer dataset included in the Cbioportal database (https://www.cbioportal.org/
  (accessed on 1 June 2022)). (J) Effect of DNMT1 on FAM107A protein expression in
  prostate cancer cells as determined by Western blotting. *** for p < 0.001, ** for
  p < 0.01 and * for p < 0.05.
