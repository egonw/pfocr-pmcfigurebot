caption: The pathway pathology of any disease can be rationalized by the primary cells
  and their cellular context that initiates the disease as well as the molecular pathways
  (genes and signaling pathways) and cellular mechanisms/pathways driving it. Knowing
  these components and their relevance is essential not only for a correct classification
  but also for an effective therapy. This is particularly true for complex diseases,
  such as cancer, that often carry multiple mutations and many active cellular mechanisms.
