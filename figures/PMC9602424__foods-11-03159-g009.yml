caption: Mycelium metabolomic profiling by GC-TOF-MS. (A) PCA score plot of the Con
  and T11 groups; (B) PLS-DA score plot of the Con and T11 groups; (C) hierarchical
  cluster map of the Con and T11 groups; (D) the volcano plots of the Con and T11
  groups; (E) the metabolic pathway impact prediction between the Con and T11 groups
  in mycelium based on the KEGG online database. The âˆ’ln(p) values from the pathway
  enrichment analysis are indicated on the vertical axis, and the impact values are
  indicated on the horizontal axis; the smaller the p-value, the redder the circle
  color, and the larger the influence value, the larger the circle; (F) heatmap of
  relative abundance of significant different metabolites (log2(FC) > 1.0, and p <
  0.05) in mycelium on the 14th day of fermentation in the Con and T11 groups.
