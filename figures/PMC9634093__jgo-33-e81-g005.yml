figure_title: Knockdown of XIST repressed tumor growth through regulating FOXP1/AKT/mTOR
  pathway by targeting miR-506-3p in vivo. (A-C) XIST silenced SKOV3 or SKOV3/CBP
  cells were injected to establish mice model and then the representative image, volume
  and weight of tumor were observed. (D) QRT-PCR evaluated XIST, miR-506-3p and FOXP1
  expressions. (E) LC3 and caspase3 levels in subcutaneous xenograft mice model injected
  with SKOV3 or SKOV3/CBP cells transfected with sh-XIST was analyzed by immunohistochemistry.
  The data were showed as mean ± SD. n=6 per group

  hairpin RNA XIST; XIST, X-inactive specific transcript.*p<0.05, †p< 0.01, and ‡p<0.001.
