caption: 'Immunohistochemical staining for p-STAT3, Cyclin D1, and Bcl-2 antibodies
  in different research groups, magnification 400, scale bar = 50 μm. (A–C) Control
  group showing a positive reaction for p-STAT3, cyclin D1, and Bcl-2 antibodies.
  (D–F) DEN group showing strong positive expression of all antibodies. (G–I) n-3
  PUFAs group showing regression of immune reactions for all antibodies. Outcomes
  are expressed as mean ± SD; one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Tukey’s test for
  intergroup comparison. * significant from the control group, # significant from
  the DEN group, p < 0.001.'
