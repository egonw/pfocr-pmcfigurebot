caption: Effects of PL on the induction of autophagy in oral cancer cell lines. The
  (A) MC-3 and (B) HSC-4 cells were stained with acridine orange to confirm detection
  of AVOs and analyzed using a fluorescence microscope. The cytoplasm and the nucleus
  stained fluorescent green and the AVOs stained fluorescent red (scale bar, 100 μm).
  (C) Cells were harvested to measure the levels of autophagy-related proteins by
  Western blotting. β-actin was used as loading control. The results are representative
  of three independent experiments (statistically significant differences, * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01 vs. the control group).
