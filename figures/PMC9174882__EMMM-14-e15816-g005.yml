figure_title: mPTCL overexpresses GATA3 and Th2 genes, resembling molecular defined
  PTCL‐GATA3
caption: FACS‐sorted TCRβ+ CD8− TCRvβ8mid ICOShi mPTCL cells and C57bl/6J CD4+ T‐cells
  were RNA sequenced. Differential expression of T‐cell subset‐associated genes were
  analyzed (n = 6). GSEA analysis of 23 gene signatures, representative of Th1, Th2,
  Th17, Tfh, Treg, T effector memory, and T central memory cells. Significantly enriched
  signatures are plotted (where q < 0.05—indicated by the vertical line). FDR Q‐values
  can be found in Dataset .Gene enrichment plot for the Th2_Bindea gene signature.Expression
  levels of GATA3 in wildtype CD4+ T‐cells versus CD45.2+ gated PTCL cells expanded
  in CD45.1 congenic hosts (n = 4). P = 7.19E‐05. Representative histograms are shown
  against an isotype‐stained mPTCL control (dashed line). Dotted line represents the
  isotype control stain for CD4 T‐cells. Data are representative of three experiments.
  Bars represent SEM.Average log2 expression levels of Th2 (Gata3, Ccr4), Th1 (Tbx21),
  and Treg (Foxp3) genes in purified TCRvβ8+ mPTCL cells versus wildtype C57bl/6J
  CD4+ T‐cells (n = 6). Adjusted P = 5.08E‐07 (Gata3), P = 9.38E‐07 (Ccr4), P = 2.87E‐08
  (Tbx21), P = 6.75E‐10 (FoxP3).The transcriptome of mPTCL spleens (n = 6) were analyzed
  by gene set variance analysis (GSVA) for enrichment of representative genes of molecular
  defined human PTCL subgroups (Iqbal et al ). A positive score indicates enrichment
  in a single sample of mPTCL‐infiltrated spleen. Scores are shown in truncated violin
  plots in which vertical lines represent the 1st quartile, the median, and the 3rd
  quartile of the data.Log2‐normalized expression of Tfh immunophenotypic markers
  in 51 cases of human PTCL from previously published datasets, with hierarchical
  clustering by PTCL subtype. “PTCL‐Tfh” represents “nodal PTCL with Tfh phenotype.”The
  GATA3 and BCL6 expression status of 86 cases of human PTCL‐NOS as assessed by IHC
  using data published in Watatani et al (). ***P < 0.001.
