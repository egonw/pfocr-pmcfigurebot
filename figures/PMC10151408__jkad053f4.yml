caption: 'Analysis of MAPK and AKT pathway activity in response to tissue specific
  knockdown vs. heterozygous loss. a and b) Western blot analysis of pAKT and pERK
  levels in protein extracts from hindguts with indicated genotypes (3 biological
  replicates/genotype). Syntaxin: loading control. c–f) Quantification of western
  blot data presented in (a) and (b). For quantification of pERK levels, all genotypes
  are normalized to GFP-only negative controls (c and d). As there were no detectable
  pAKT bands in GFP-only negative controls (top blots in a and b), all genotypes were
  normalized to KRAS TP53 PTEN APC (e) or KRAS (f). Error bars represent SEM. *P ≤
  0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ****P ≤ 0.0001 (one-way ANOVA, PRISM Software).'
