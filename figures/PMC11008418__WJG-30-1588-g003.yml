caption: 'Inhibition of the p53/glutathione peroxidase 4/gasdermin D signaling pathway
  exacerbates acute liver injury in vitro. A and B: The levels of alanine aminotransferase
  and aspartate aminotransferase were changed in HL7702 cells (n = 3); C-E: The levels
  of iron, reactive oxygen species, and glutathione were changed in HL7702 cells (n
  = 3); F: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses of p53, glutathione
  peroxidase 4 (GPX4), solute carrier family 7a member 11 (SLC7A11), Acyl-CoA synthetase
  long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4), and gasdermin D (GSDMD) mRNA expression (n =
  3 in each group); G: Western blot analyses of p53, GPX4, and GSDMD protein expression
  (n = 3 in each group); H: Western blot analyses of SLC7A11 and ACSL4 protein expression
  (n = 3 in each group). aP < 0.05, bP < 0.01. ALF: Acute liver failure; AST: Aspartate
  aminotransferase; ALT: Alanine aminotransferase; IL: Interleukin; GPX4: Glutathione
  peroxidase 4; SLC7A11: Solute carrier family 7a member 11; ACSL4: Acyl-CoA synthetase
  long-chain family member 4; GSDMD: Gasdermin D; SIRT1: Silent information regulator
  sirtuin 1; LPS: Lipopolysaccharide; D-GalN: D-galactosamine.'
