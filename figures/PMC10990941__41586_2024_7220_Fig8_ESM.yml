figure_title: Relationship between the immediate early gene response, inflammatory
  response, and γH2AX signals
caption: a, b, c Representative micrographs of γH2AX and cFos signals with Erg1, CREB,
  and RelA, respectively. d Regression analyses of γH2AX signals with Erg1, CREB,
  and RelA, respectively in individual neurons. 1 h after CFC, γH2AX puncta show no
  correlation with Erg1 (n = 120 neurons, 20 neurons/mouse). Similarly, γH2AX signals
  did not correlate with CREB levels (n = 120 neurons, 20 neurons/mouse). Significant
  correlation and neuronal overlap of RelA and γH2AX-positive puncta (n = 120 neurons,
  20 neurons/mouse) providing support for an inflammatory component of dsDNA damage
  and DDR. At time points of optimal RelA detection, cFos levels were expectedly low.
  The r and P values are depicted in the individual graphs. e Examples of random occurrence
  of γH2AX puncta relative to individual IEG. f Segregated γH2AX and cFos labeling
  96 h after context memory reactivation.
