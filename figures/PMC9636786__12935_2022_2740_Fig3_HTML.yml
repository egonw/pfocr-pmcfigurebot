caption: Effects of menin pharmacological inhibition on OC cells proliferation and
  transcriptome. (A) PEO1 (left) and PEO4 (right) relative cell viability assessed
  in cells treated with increasing concentrations of MI-136. Data represent the mean
  of six independent replicates ± SD (* p ≤ 0.05). (B) Venn diagrams showing the number
  of down- (left) and up- (right) regulated transcripts in PEO1 and PEO4 cells, cultivated
  in the presence of 0.8 µM MI-136 or vehicle (DMSO) for 9 days. First quartile (Q1)
  fold-change threshold was applied to identify differentially expressed genes (|FC|
  ≥ Q1, padj ≤ 0.05). RNA-seq was performed in biological triplicates. (C) Heatmap
  and hierarchical clustering with dissimilarity measured using Manhattan distance
  showing common concordantly deregulated transcripts in PEO1 and PEO4 cells upon
  MEN1 silencing or pharmacological inhibition with 0.8 µM MI-136 (|FC| ≥ Q1, padj ≤ 0.05).
  (D) Circos plot showing genes, over- (red) and under- (blue) rerepresented in MI-136-treated
  respect to control (DMSO-treated) PEO4 cells, and the statistically significant
  (p ≤ 0.05) aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway and integrin signaling pathway
  that tend to be up-regulated
