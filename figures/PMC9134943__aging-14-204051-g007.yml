caption: ILF3 was involved in the regulation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. The
  effect of ILF3 on PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway was verified with western blot.
  ILF3-specific small interference RNA (si-ILF3) and statins treatment significantly
  inhibited PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. The expression of p-PI3K/PI3K, p-AKT/AKT,
  and p-mTOR/mTOR were significantly downregulated compared to control group. And
  the expression of PI3K, AKT and mTOR and p-mTOR did not change significantly.
