caption: 'Expression of target genes in the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway. Total
  RNA was extracted from synovial cells from mice in four groups (normal, normal+stretching
  exercise, model, and model+stretching exercise). Cells in the model and model+stretching
  exercise groups were treated with LiCl or IWR. (a) TNF-α, (b) IL-17, (c) β-catenin,
  and (d) Bcl-2 mRNA expression levels were determined using RT-qPCR. The β-actin
  mRNA was used as an internal reference. All experiments were performed in triplicates,
  and data are representative of three independent experiments. Data are presented
  as means ± SD. Differences and comparisons between multiple groups were analysed
  using one-way ANOVA followed by a post hoc test (Tukey''s test). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P
  < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. control; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, and ###P < 0.001 vs.
  model; &P < 0.05, &&P < 0.01, and &&&P < 0.001 vs. model+stretching exercise.'
