caption: Predictors for prolonged hospital length of stay (LOS) (>5 days) (A) and
  intensive care unit (ICU) admission (B) in hospitalized pediatric patients with
  respiratory syncytial virus infection (N = 312). Estimated odds ratios (ORs) and
  95% confidence intervals (CIs) for selected covariates based on multivariate logistic
  regression with stepwise selection. A threshold of 15% for selecting criteria for
  stepwise approach in multivariate logistic regression modeling was applied to identify
  the most impactful predictors on the outcome of interest. The cycle threshold (Ct)
  value, defined as the number of cycles required for the fluorescent signal to cross
  the threshold of detection, is inversely proportional to the viral load; values
  of <25 are indicative of a high viral load, whereas values of ≥25 indicate a moderate
  or low viral load. The denominator used to calculate proportions shown in the Overall
  column is the overall population number (N = 312). To calculate each proportion
  shown in the hospital LOS >5 days and admitted to ICU columns, the total number
  of patients within each subgroup was used as the denominator. *Patient pathway was
  classed as general practitioner (GP) if patients were seen by the GP before being
  admitted, emergency department (ED) if patients presented directly to the ED without
  any prior GP or outpatient ward visit, and outpatient ward if patients were seen
  in an outpatient ward before being admitted.
