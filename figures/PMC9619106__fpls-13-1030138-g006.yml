caption: TFBs prediction and dual luciferase reporter assay between the protein StGLK014720
  and the seven structural DEGs in the proline metabolic pathway. (A) Prediction of
  GLK binding sites in the promoter regions of the 7 structural DEGs in the proline
  metabolic pathway. (B) The ratios of LUC activity relative to REN activity represent
  the relative activities of the proline structural gene promoters. The LUC/REN ratios
  of the control were set to 1, to which the ratios of other groups were normalized.
  Data presented as means ± standard error from three biological replicates were tested
  by the Student t-test (** P < 0.01).
