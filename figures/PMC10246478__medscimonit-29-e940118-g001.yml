caption: 'The biogenesis of migrasomes and exosomes. (A) The biogenesis of exosomes.
  The endocytosed components can be delivered to the endocytic pathway and form endocytic
  vesicles, and then can be transferred into early endosome (EE) (a), early endosomal
  membranes can form intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) which package the cargo and deliver
  to late endosomes (LE) (b) and lysosomes (c). ILVs in multivesicular(MVB) endosomes
  can be released extracellularly as exosomes (d), which package various cellular
  contents such as proteins and RNAs. Software (name: PowerPoint; version: 15.31 (170216);
  manufacturer: Microsoft) was used for creation of the figure. (B) The biogenesis
  of migrasomes. When a cell moves, retraction fibers are formed at the edge of the
  migrating cell. Migrasomes form at the tips of, or at the intersections between,
  these retraction fibers. The migrasomes contain numerous smaller vesicles, and package
  cytosol, including proteins and RNAs. Software (name: PowerPoint; version: 15.31
  (170216); manufacturer: Microsoft) was used for creation of the figure.'
