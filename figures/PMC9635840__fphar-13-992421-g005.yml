caption: Inhibition of PPARγ by GW9662 abrogated the anti-fibrotic role of Nephropathy
  1st. (A) Western blot showed the electrophoretic band of FN, Col-I, PPARγ, and Klotho;
  and the relative protein expression of FN, Col-I, PPARγ, and Klotho based on the
  gray value of WB. (B) Immunofluorescence (IF) technology showed the expression of
  α-SMA and collagen III protein level and the position in NRK-49F cells treated with
  TGF-β1 and GW9662 in the presence of lotensin or Nephropathy 1st. Data were representative
  of three independent experiments. *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01.
