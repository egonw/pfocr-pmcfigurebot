figure_title: Low expression of GBA1 promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition
  (EMT) via activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway
caption: A, D The expression of EMT markers in MHCC-97H cells with stable GBA1 overexpression
  (A) or HepG2 cells with stable GBA1 downregulation (D) as detected by Western blotting.
  B, E The expression of phospho-LRP6 and the Wnt target genes c-myc and/or cyclin
  D1, which are related to the Wnt signalling pathway in MHCC-97H cells with stable
  GBA1 overexpression (B) or HepG2 cells with stable GBA1 downregulation (E) was detected
  by Western blotting. C, F Western blot analysis was performed to determine the level
  of non-phospho-β-catenin in the cytoplasm and nucleus of MHCC-97H cells with stable
  GBA1 overexpression (C) or HepG2 cells with stable GBA1 downregulation (F). G Western
  blotting was performed to analyse the effect of GBA1 overexpression on the Wnt3a-activating
  EMT. H Western blotting was performed to analyse the effect of GBA1 overexpression
  on the Wnt3a-activated Wnt signalling pathway.
