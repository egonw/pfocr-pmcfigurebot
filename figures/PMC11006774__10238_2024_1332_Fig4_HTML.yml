caption: MiR-181c/d Modulate the Response to Chemotherapy by Targeting Key Signaling
  Networks in BTC. A-B Heatmap demonstrating log relative expression level of differentially
  expressed genes between the groups of patients in which miRNAs were UP-regulated
  and orange the DOWN-regulated. Cell colors (blue-white-orange-red gradient) correspond
  the binary logarithm of the ratio of the expression level in a current sample to
  the average level across all the samples (per each gene). Cluster analysis grouped
  samples and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) according to similarity in expression.
  DEGs are in rows and samples in columns. The DEGs clustering tree is indicated on
  the left. To create the heatmap we converted the read counts into log2-counts-per-million
  (logCPM) values. C Representative GSEA plots of Hypoxia, MYC targets, Nuclear Receptor
  Transcription, Metabolism of Aminoacids and Derivatives, and PPAR signaling pathway
  gene signatures. Only the gene sets that showed the normalized enrichment score
  (NES > 2.0) and false discovery rate (FDR) q value < 5% were reported. Representative
  Heatmaps of differentially expressed genes constituting the leading-edge subsets
  within the gene sets shown. Each row represents a gene, and each column represents
  the Median Fold Change (Log) of miRNA-181c/d UP-regulated patients vs DOWN-regulated.
  D Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) with compiled modules from Hallmarks in MSigDB.
  Dot plots of GSEA results illustrated Hallmarks gene network associated with miRNA-181c/d
  expression in BTC patients. The figures show the significant top 15 positively and
  the top 15 negatively enriched GO terms, based on co-expressed genes. Dot color
  indicates the Enrichment Score (ES). Dot size indicates the p value (− Log10 pvalue).
