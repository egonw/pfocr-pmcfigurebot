caption: Effects of BRAF and Mek kinase inhibitors on the viability and the MAPK pathway
  signaling. (a) Dose-dependent inhibition of DU-4475 cell viability by BRAF (dabrafenib
  and vemurafenib) and Mek (binimetinib and trametinib) kinase inhibitors. The reported
  values are the average of six wells from two triplicate assays and standard error.
  (b) Western blots of BRAF, Mek and Erk total protein and phosphorylation status
  in DU-4475 cells after the cells were treated with indicated drugs for 1 h. Î²-actin
  was used as a loading control. Uncropped Western Blots and densitometry can be found
  at .
