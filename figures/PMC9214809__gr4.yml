caption: Effect of seladelpar on Fgf21 expression.A and B, mice were orally gavaged
  with seladelpar (10 mg/kg body weight) and harvested 6 h later. A, hepatic gene
  expression of Fgf21. B, serum levels of Fgf21. C, primary mouse hepatocytes were
  treated with seladelpar (10 μM) for 48 h, and Fgf21 was measured in the medium.
  D–F, primary mouse hepatocytes were treated with seladelpar (10 μM) or the PPARA
  agonist Wy14643 (10 μM) for 48 h and mRNA expression was examined. G–I, primary
  hepatocytes isolated from Ppara-/- mice were treated with seladelpar (10 μM) or
  Wy14643 (10 μM) for 48 h and mRNA expression was examined. Data are presented as
  mean ± S.E.M. of at least three independent replicates. ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01
  denote the significant difference between control and seladelpar or Wy14643. PPARA,
  peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor alpha.
