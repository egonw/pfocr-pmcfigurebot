figure_title: Four ferroptosis defense pathways
caption: Four ferroptosis defense pathways have been found so far, namely, Cyst(e)ine/GSH/GPX4
  axis, FSP1-CoQ10-NAD(P)H axis, GCH1/BH4 axis, and DHODH/CoQH2 axis; ① GPX4 specifically
  catalyzes the loss of oxidative activity of lipid peroxides through glutathione
  (GSH)-dependent manner, and protects cells from the threat of ferroptosis is the
  most classic way; ② as a phospholipid peroxidation inhibitor that does not rely
  on glutathione, FSP1 converts ubiquinone on the cell membrane into reduced ubiquinol,
  which can inhibit peroxidation and prevent ferroptosis; ③ the GCH1/BH4 pathway acts
  as an endogenous antioxidant pathway, GCH1 protects cells from ferroptosis primarily
  through the antioxidant action of BH4; ④ DHODH resists ferroptosis in mitochondria
  by regulating the production of dihydroubiquinone in the inner membrane of mitochondria.
