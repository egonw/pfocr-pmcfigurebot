caption: Combined untargeted metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis. (A,B) Cluster
  analysis of transcriptome data of WT and anther of double mutant plants. (A) Upregulation
  of gene-related pathways in the anthers of the bhlh010 bhlh089 double mutant plants
  compared with the wild type. (B) Downregulation of gene-related pathways in the
  anthers of the bhlh010 bhlh089 double mutant plants compared with the wild type.
  Asterisks indicate pathways associated with pollen development. The horizontal axis
  shows the number of genes, and the darker the ruler, the greater the correlation.
  (C) Combined metabolomics and transcriptome analysis of WT and bhlh010 bhlh089 double
  mutants. Each circle denotes a metabolic pathway. The bigger the circle, the more
  metabolites and genes are involved. The redder the color, the greater the correlation.
  (Dâ€“G) Significantly different genes in WT and bhlh010 bhlh089 double mutant anthers.
  (D) Differential genes associated with cellulose synthesis. (E) Other metabolism-related
  differential genes. (F) Differential genes associated with metabolite transport.
  (G) Differential genes associated with glycosyltransferase.
