caption: Effect of knockdown of DUSP1 on BCG-induced apoptosis in macrophages. (A–C)
  THP-1 cells were transfected with siRNA-NC (negative control) or siRNA-DUSP1 for
  24 h and then infected with BCG and cultured for 6 h. Cleaved-Caspase3 and Cleaved-PARP1
  protein expression was detected by western blotting. (D, E) Knockdown of DUSP1 combined
  with BCG infection were detected by immunofluorescence technique for Cleaved-Caspase3
  and Cleaved-PARP1 expression levels. Scale bar, 75 μm. (F, G) THP-1 cells were transfected
  with siRNA-NC (negative control) or siRNA-DUSP1 for 24 h and then infected with
  BCG and cultured for 6 h, apoptosis was determined by Annexin V/PI staining using
  FCS analysis. (H) THP-1 cells were transfected with siRNA-NC or siRNA-DUSP1 for
  24 h and then infected with BCG and cultured for 6 h, the morphological effects
  of DUSP1 on apoptosis of BCG-infected THP-1 cells were observed by transmission
  electron microscopy, the blue arrow denotes the cytoplasmic vacuole of apoptotic
  cells, while the red arrow indicates the nucleus. Scale bar, 2 μm. All data are
  represented as mean ± SD (n = 3). (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).
