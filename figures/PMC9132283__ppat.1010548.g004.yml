figure_title: OsNF-YAs suppress JA signaling
caption: A. qRT-PCR results showing the relative expression levels of JA pathway genes
  (OsJAZ8; OsJAZ9; OsJAZ12; OsJAZ11; OsLOX2; JiOsPR10) in OE-OsNF-YA2 transgenic plants
  and RNAi-OsNF-YA mutant plants compared with NIP background under RSV infection.
  OsUBQ5 was used as the internal reference gene to normalize the relative expression.
  Error bars represent SD of 3 biological replicates. Significant differences were
  identified using Fisher’s least significant difference tests. *At the top of columns
  indicates significant difference at p ≤ 0.05. B. Phenotypes of OE-OsNF-YA2 transgenic
  plants and RNAi-OsNF-YA mutant plants grown on rice nutrient solution containing
  2 μM or 5 μM MeJA for 5 days. Scale bar, 5 cm. C. Quantification of root length
  in indicated plants following MeJA treatment. The root lengths of five-day-old seedlings
  grown in normal rice culture solutions supplemented with different concentrations
  of MeJA were measured. Data shown are the means from at least 15 seedlings for each
  sample. Error bars represent SD. Different letters at the top of columns indicate
  significant difference a p ≤ 0.05 by Fisher’s LSD tests.
