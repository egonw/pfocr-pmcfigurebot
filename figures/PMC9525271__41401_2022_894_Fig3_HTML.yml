figure_title: ADH1C expression is negatively related with CRC
caption: a There was lower ADH1C expression in colorectal tumors than that in para-carcinoma
  tissue. Data and statistics were obtained from www.oncomine.org. (a) Kaiser et al.
  (2007); (b) Ki et al. (2007); (c) Hong et al. (2010); (d) Gaedcke et al. (2010);
  (e) Nortterman et al. (2010); (f) Skrzypczak et al. (2010). Compared with normal
  colorectal cell line NCM460, ADH1C expression is lower in CRC cell lines at both
  b transcriptional level and c post-transcriptional level. d There was lower expression
  of ADH1C protein in tumors than that in para-carcinoma tissue of CRC tissue microarray.
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
