caption: Biological Function and Pathway Analysis. (A) GO enrichment analysis of target
  genes. In the figure, terms enriched in the BP category are depicted in blue, terms
  enriched in the CC category in green, and terms enriched in the MF category in yellow.
  The p valueâ€™s cutoff value was set at 0.05. p value is used to rank terms within
  a category. (B) KEGG enrichment analysis of target gene. (C) Distribution of Target
  genes in the MAPK signaling pathway. The red box in the figure represents Target
  genes.
