caption: 'Profile of the altered enzymes that can be used as prognosis biomarkers
  in COVID‐19 and the main organs that are compromised by SARS‐CoV‐2. Enzymes whose
  levels are elevated in SARS‐CoV‐2 infection: LDH: lactate dehydrogenase (intracellular
  enzyme produced in the liver, pancreas, kidneys, and heart and responsible for converting
  pyruvate into lactate); AST: aspartate aminotransferase (cytoplasmic and mitochondrial
  enzyme present in hepatocytes); ALT: alanine aminotransferase (cytoplasmic enzyme
  present in hepatocytes); GGT: γ‐glutamyltransferase (membrane enzyme in hepatocytes);
  GAPDH: glyceraldehyde 3‐phosphate dehydrogenase (cytoplasmic ubiquitous enzyme from
  the glycolytic pathway); amylase and lipase: common biochemical markers of acute
  pancreatitis because they are produced by pancreatic acinar cells. Enzymes whose
  levels are reduced in SARS‐CoV‐2 infection: ECMP: enzymes from the cholesterol metabolism
  pathway (active in the liver). COVID‐19, coronavirus disease 2019; SARS‐CoV‐2, severe
  acute respiratory syndrome‐coronavirus 2 [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]'
