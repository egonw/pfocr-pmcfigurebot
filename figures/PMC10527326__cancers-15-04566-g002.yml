caption: 'Metabolic and signaling pathways in NAFLD/NASH-associated HCC. Abnormal
  metabolism: accumulation of arginine, glucose metabolites, phosphocreatine, SAM,
  GSH, and alterations of urea and NO cycles are observed in NAFLD/NASH HCC. These
  events are associated with developed lipotoxicity, activation of de novo lipogenesis
  (SREBP-1), lipid peroxidation, fatty acid β oxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction,
  activation of oxidative (MAPK, Nrf2, NF-kB, C-jun/C-fos/C-myc/AP1) and ER stresses
  (p62, Keap1, Nrf2, STING, CNPY2)-related signaling, wnt/β-catenin pathway, and suppression
  of autophagy (mTORC1, AMPK, p62), with the central role for mTOR pathway. Abbreviations:
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; NO, nitric oxide; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TCA,
  tricarboxylic acid cycle; INSR, insulin receptor; GLUT1, glucose trasporter 1; STING1,
  stimulator of interferon response cGAMP interactor 1; SAM, S-adeninemethyonine;
  SAH, S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine; Ub, ubiquitin; LC3, microtubule-associated protein
  1A/1B−light chain 3; sMAF, small maf protein; CAT, cationic amino acid transporter;
  PKC, protein kinase C; MnSOD, manganese superoxide dismutase; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate; PI3K, phosphoinositide
  3-kinase; AKT, protein kinase B (serine/threonine-specific protein kinase); p38,
  p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase;
  ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ARG1,
  arginase1; ASL, argininosuccinate lyase; ASS, argininosuccinate synthase; AGAT,
  arginine-glycine amidinotransferase; GAMT, guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase;
  NOS, nitric oxide synthase; CK, creatine kinase; HK, hexokinase; G6PI, glucose-6-phosphate
  isomerase; PFKM, 6-phosphofructokinase; G6PC, glucose-6-phosphatase; FBP, fructose
  1,6-bisphosphate aldolase; PGM, phosphoglycerate mutase; MAT, methionine adenosyltransferase;
  GPX, glutathione peroxidase, GR, glutathione reductase.'
