caption: Pathway enrichment analysis, including the metabolites differentially expressed
  in patients with ACLF compared to patients with decompensated cirrhosis without
  ACLF. A significant enrichment for several metabolic pathways was identified for
  these metabolites (P < 0.05). The y axis represents the P value; the x axis represents
  the pathway impact (pathways more likely to be modified in ACLF compared with decompensated
  cirrhosis without ACLF). Node color is based on the P value (red indicates a higher
  level of significance), and node radius is based on the pathway impact value. Metabolites
  increased in ACLF versus decompensated cirrhosis without ACLF.
