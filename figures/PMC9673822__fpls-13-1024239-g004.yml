caption: Different expression genes (DEGs) of roots (B1), rhizomes (B2), pseudobulbs
  (B3) and leaves (B4) in P. chinensis. (A), DEGs statistics of B2 vs B1, B3 vs B1,
  B4 vs B1. The blue bar represents all DEGs, red bar represents up-regulated DEGs,
  and green bar represents down-regulated DEGs; (B), Venn diagram of DEGs in different
  comparison groups. The circle color of pink, orange, green, blue, red and black
  represents B1 vs B2, B1 vs B3, B1 vs B4, B2 vs B3, B2 vs B4 and B3 vs B4, respectively;
  (C), Enriched GO terms of DEGs in B3 vs B1. The red bar represents up regulation
  and the blue bar represents down regulation. (D), Enriched KEGG pathway of DEGs
  in B3 vs B1. The size of the dots represented the number of DEGs. Red and blue represented
  high and low expression levels, respectively. GO, gene ontology; DEGs, different
  expression genes.
