caption: PANTHER Overrepresentation Analysis of the molecular function of the DEGs
  shared by cep290 and bbs2 mutants with a |log2 > 0.5| fold change in expression.
  (A) GO Molecular Function analysis to identify the molecular functions that were
  over- or underrepresented for the common DEGs. (B) Cone-specific genes expressed
  at lower levels in both mutants (C) PANTHER Pathway analysis to identify signaling
  pathways that are over- or underrepresented for common DEGS.

  and bbs2 mutants by RNA-seq reveals upregulation of inflammatory and stress-related
  pathways.
