figure_title: Robust regeneration following focal AT2 loss
caption: 'a, b Alveolar regions of adult control LyzM-Cre;Rosa26-mTmG;Fgfr2fl/+ (a)
  and AT2 conditional deletion LyzM-Cre;Rosa26-mTmG;Fgfr2fl/fl (b) mice immunostained
  as indicated. Note loss in b of lineage-labeled AT2 but preserved alveolar architecture.
  Mac2, macrophage marker. Bars, 50 µm. c Quantification of a, b. AT2 density is maintained
  in Fgfr2fl/fl deletion by the compensatory expansion of unlabeled AT2 (with unrecombined
  Fgfrfl alleles). n = 300 cells scored/condition (six animals, mean ± SD); p = 0.65
  (not significant, Student’s two-sided t-test) for density difference. d AT2 proliferation
  in control adult Sftpc-CreER;Rosa26-mTmG;Fgfr2fl/+ and AT2 conditional Fgfr2 deletion
  Sftpc-CreER;Rosa26-mTmG;Fgfr2fl/delta by EdU labeling for 2 weeks following tamoxifen.
  n = 400 AT2 cells scored/condition (six lungs, mean ± SD). ***p = 5.4 × 10−6 (Student’s
  two-sided t-test). e Alveolar region of adult Sftpc-CreER;Rosa26-mTmG tamoxifen-induced
  to label AT2 and instilled with Fgfr inhibitor FIIN-1 then stained 48 h later for
  Ki67 and markers indicated. Arrowheads, proliferating AT2 (Ki67pos,GFPpos). Bar,
  50 µm. f Quantification of e. n = 800 AT2 cells scored/condition (six animals, mean ± SD).
  **p = 2.6 × 10−3 (Student’s two-sided t-test). g Time course of AT2 apoptosis (cCasp3pos),
  compensatory AT2 proliferation (Ki67pos), and conversion to AT1 (Pdpnpos) after
  FIIN-1 instillation in adult SftpcCreER/+;Rosa26mTmG/+ lungs (see Fig. ) and subsequent
  staining (AT2 lineage mGFP, cCasp3, Ki67, Pdpn). mGFPpos (AT2 lineage) cells were
  scored in instilled (WGApos) regions; uninstilled regions and vehicle-instilled
  lungs showed no changes. n = 300 mGFPpos cells scored per stain/timepoint (21 animals,
  mean ± SD). h Vehicle and FIIN-1-treated alveolar regions 2 weeks after instillation.
  Note clusters of lineage-labeled AT2 (asterisks) and conversion to AT1 (arrowheads)
  in FIIN-1 lung, and overall restoration of the alveolar structure. Bar, 100 µm.
  Stain repeated in biological triplicate. i Sequential roles of Fgf/Fgfr2 pathway
  in alveolus: AT2 selection and 2o induction of AT1 (embryo), AT2 fate consolidation
  and prevention of reprogramming to AT1 (juvenile), and AT2 survival (adult, mediated
  by Akt). AT2 loss triggers regeneration by AT2stem. j Source and dynamics of FGF
  signaling. After AT2 selection in development (left), a 2° signal induces other
  progenitors to AT1 fate. FGF signaling remains active in adults, maintaining AT2
  (middle). Loss of FGF in the stressed alveolus (right) triggers AT2 apoptosis and
  rapid replacement. k FGF signaling in adults might prevent AT2 overgrowth/tumors
  by depriving daughters (dashed) moving away from the FGF source of survival signal.
  All experiments were repeated at least three times.'
