caption: 'Silencing RRP9 induces gemcitabine chemosensitivity in PC cells. A RRP9
  mRNA levels in control cells and RRP-9-siRNA-treated (siRNA#1 and siRNA#2) cells.
  Data are expressed by mean ± SD, n = 3. B RRP9 protein levels in control cells and
  RRP-9-siRNA-treated (siRNA#1 and siRNA#2) cells. Data are denoted by mean ± SD,
  n = 3. C Cell viability was assessed in control and RRP9-silenced cells treated
  with increasing concentrations of gemcitabine. Data are given as mean ± SD, n = 50 μM.
  IC50 gemcitabine in cells that indicated. D Representative colony formation images
  (left) and quantification (right) are shown for control and RRP9-silenced cells
  treated with vehicle or gemcitabine (50 μM). Data are denoted by mean ± SD, n = 3.
  E Apoptosis was measured in control and RRP9-silenced cells treated with vehicle
  or gemcitabine (50 μM). FACS analysis (left) and quantification (right) of levels
  of apoptosis. Data are given as mean ± SD, n = 3. Note: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01'
