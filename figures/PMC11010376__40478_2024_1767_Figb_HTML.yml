caption: 'Expression of lipoxin pathway in mouse retina and optic nerve. (A) Representative
  images of RNAscope ISH (red) (indicated with white arrows) of retina and optic nerve
  using mRNA probes for Alox5, Alox15, and Fpr2. Nuclei were labeled with DAPI to
  distinguish nuclear layers of the retina. All images were obtained using a 40x objective.
  Scale bar = 50 μm. (n = 3). Labels: ganglion cell layer (GCL), inner nuclear layer
  (INL), outer nuclear layer (ONL). (B) Bar graphs represent the quantification of
  RNAscope images performed by Qupath software. (C) Bar graphs represent Ct values
  of lipoxin pathway genes in retinal astrocytes and optic nerves analyzed by qPCR
  (n = 3)'
