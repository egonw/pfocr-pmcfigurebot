caption: The pIKKε interacts with pSTING on the C-terminal tail region.A, schematic
  of pSTING molecular structure and its truncated mutants. B, the protein expressions
  of full-length pSTING and its truncated mutants. C–F, each GFP-pSTING or its truncation
  mutants were cotransfected with mCherry-pIKKε into HEK293T for 48 h, and the cells
  were harvested and subjected for co-IP and subsequent Western blot analysis by using
  indicated antibodies. CBD, cyclic dinucleotide–binding domain; co-IP, coimmunoprecipitation;
  CTT, C-terminal tail; HEK293T, human embryonic kidney 293T cell line; pIKKε, porcine
  IKKε; STING, stimulator of interferon genes.
article_title: Porcine IKKε is involved in the STING-induced type I IFN antiviral
  response of the cytosolic DNA signaling pathway.
