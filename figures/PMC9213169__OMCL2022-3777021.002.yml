caption: The neuroprotective effect of TCMs on AD through protein phosphorylation
  by the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Artemisinin, Astragaloside IV, ginsenoside Rb1, and
  20(s)-protopanaxadiol activated PI3K/Akt kinases which in turn blocked downstream
  the activation of GSK-3Î² and reduced the content of p-tau in AD.
