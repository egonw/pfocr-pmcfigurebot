caption: Effect of hydroxytyrosol on the levels of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production
  in Jurkat (panel A) and HL60 (panel B) cell lines. The percentage of negative ROS,
  ROS (−), and positive ROS, ROS (+), values observed for each treatment are represented.
  Panel A corresponds to Jurkat cells and Panel B to HL60 cells. Cells were treated
  with hydroxytyrosol IC50 for 24 h for Jurkat (A) and 72 h for HL60 (B) cells. Histograms
  from a representative experiment showing the effects of hydroxytyrosol on ROS production
  are plotted at the top. The lower part represents the percentages of ROS (+) and
  ROS (−) in the control and treated cultures. Values are expressed as mean ± SEM
  (n = 12). The presence of an asterisk indicates significant differences (p < 0.001)
  between the levels of ROS (+) and ROS (−) versus control and treatment.
