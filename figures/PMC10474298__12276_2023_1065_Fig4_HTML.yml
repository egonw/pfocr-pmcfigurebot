figure_title: Rnf146 overexpression in the PFC causes social deficits in mice
caption: 'a Diagram for AAV constructs encoding mouse Rnf146 (mRNF146) and eGFP. ITR,
  inverted terminal repeat sequence; WPRE, Woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) posttranscriptional
  regulatory element. b Schematic diagram of bilateral AAV virus injection in the
  PFC (left) and an example of a brain slice expressing Rnf146 in the PFC (right).
  ACC, anterior cingulate cortex; PL, prelimbic cortex; IL, infralimbic cortex. c
  Left: In the social preference test, Rnf146-overexpressing mice showed a significant
  preference for a novel conspecific (M) versus an object (O) compared to eGFP-overexpressing
  control mice (n = 11 mice for eGFP, n = 11 mice for Rnf146, two-way ANOVA: Rnf146,
  F1, 40 = 0.000, P > 0.9999; target, F1, 40 = 65.87, ****P < 0.0001; interaction,
  F1, 20 = 6.025, *P = 0.0234; Sidak’s multiple comparisons test: eGFP, mouse versus
  object t40 = 7.52, ****P < 0.0001; Rnf146, mouse versus object t40 = 3.958, ***P = 0.0006).
  Right: preference index (PI) of eGFP- or Rnf146-overexpressing mice. Rnf146-overexpressing
  mice showed PI values comparable to those of control mice (n = 11 mice for eGFP,
  n = 11 mice for Rnf146, two-tailed unpaired t test; t20 = 1.781, P = 0.0901). d
  Representative heatmap images from eGFP-overexpressing mice (left) and Rnf146-overexpressing
  mice (right) of social behavior during the social preference test. e Left: in the
  social recognition test, Rnf146-overexpressing mice did not show a significant preference
  for a novel conspecific (N) versus a familiar conspecific (F), while eGFP-overexpressing
  control mice showed a significant preference for the novel conspecific (n = 11 mice
  for eGFP, n = 11 mice for Rnf146, two-way ANOVA: Rnf146, F1, 40 = 0, P > 0.9999;
  target, F1, 40 = 39.94, ****P < 0.0001; interaction, F1, 40 = 15.22, ***P = 0.0004;
  Sidak’s multiple comparisons test: eGFP, novel versus familiar t40 = 7.227, ****P < 0.0001;
  Rnf146, novel versus familiar t40 = 1.71, P = 0.1810). Right: PI of eGFP- or Rnf146-overexpressing
  mice. Rnf146-overexpressing mice showed significantly lower PI values than control
  mice (n = 11 mice for eGFP, n = 11 mice for Rnf146 group, two-tailed unpaired t
  test; t20 = 2.759, *P = 0.0121). f Representative heatmap images from eGFP-overexpressing
  mice (left) and Rnf146-overexpressing mice (right) of social behavior during the
  social recognition test. g Western blot analysis of the Wnt signaling pathway in
  the PFC of Rnf146-overexpressing mice. Samples from the PFC of GFP-overexpressing
  mice were used as controls. h Rnf146-overexpressing mice showed significantly increased
  Rnf146 levels (normalized to tubulin levels) compared to eGFP-overexpressing mice
  (n = 7 mice for eGFP, n = 10 mice for Rnf146, two-tailed unpaired t test; t14 = 2.381,
  *P = 0.0320). i Rnf146-overexpressing mice showed significantly decreased p-β-catenin
  levels (normalized to β-catenin levels) compared to eGFP-overexpressing mice (n = 7
  mice for eGFP, n = 10 mice for Rnf146, two-tailed unpaired t test; t14 = 2.995,
  **P = 0.0096). j Rnf146-overexpressing mice showed a comparable β-catenin level
  (normalized to tubulin levels) compared to eGFP-overexpressing mice (n = 7 mice
  for eGFP, n = 10 mice for Rnf146, two-tailed unpaired t test; t14 = 1.483, P = 0.1601).'
