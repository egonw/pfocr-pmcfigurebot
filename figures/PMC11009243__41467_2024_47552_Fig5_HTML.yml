figure_title: Topographic mapping identifies ERNA as spatially defined electrophysiological
  signature of the indirect pathway that predicts postoperative clinical improvement
caption: A Individual examples of waveform averages along a representative trajectory.
  B Group data (n = 20) representation of the amplitudes of second peak (P2) normalized
  to the trajectory-specific maximum, mapped with respect to the electrophysiologically
  defined entry to STN based on intraoperative microelectrode recordings. X-axis refers
  to distance from STN entry. Shade represents standard error of the mean. C Group
  data (n = 19; postoperative neuroimaging was unavailable for one patient) of the
  ERNA amplitude heatmap in MNI space (superimposed onto an STN atlas rendering);
  orientation arrows d = dorsal; m = medial; p = posterior. D Correlations of improvements
  in lateralized UPDRS III (left; Rho = −0.5947; p = 0.0168) and akinetic-rigid (right;
  Rho = −0.6058; p = 0.0120) subscrores and the Euclidean distance between the DBS
  clinical sweet spot and the patient-specific ERNA hotspot. Scatter plots depict
  Spearman’s correlations; p values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the
  Bonferroni correction (2 hypotheses). E Renderings of primary motor cortex (M1;
  face, upper extremity, and lower extremity), supplementary motor area (SMA), and
  premotor hyperdirect pathway fibers, and GPe-STN and STN-GPe indirect pathway fibers
  based on the subcortical Petersen fiber atlas (superimposed onto the DISTAL atlas
  STN and GPe renderings and 7T brain scan in MNI 152 space) along with F the fiber
  recruitment profile for the group level ERNA hotspot considering a 1 mm radius (see
  methods for further specifications).
