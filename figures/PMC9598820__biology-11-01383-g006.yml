caption: 'The inhibitory effect of miR-1275 upregulated by genistein on the EMT and
  stemness of HCC can be reversed by the activation of the EIF5A2/PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway. (A,B) Comet Assay for evaluating the DNA damage and apoptosis of HCC-LM3
  cells in four groups: NC + genistein, miR-1275 mimic + genistein, miR-1275 mimic
  + EIF5A2-NC + genistein and miR-1275 mimic + EIF5A2 + genistein. (C,D) The flow
  cytometry analysis on cell cycles of HCC-LM3 cells in the above four groups. (E)
  WB analysis on the expression levels of EIF5A2, PI3K, Akt, p-Akt, EMT markers (E-cadherin,
  N-cadherin, Vimentin) and stemness markers (BMI1, SOX2, OCT4) in HCC-LM3 cells in
  the above four groups. (F) A proposed model illustrating the role of miR-1275 upregulated
  by genistein in inhibiting the EMT and stemness of HCC cells. Plotted values representing
  the mean Â± SEM from three independent assays are provided in the images (n = 3).
