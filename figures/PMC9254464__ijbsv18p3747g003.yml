caption: 'OXI initiates autophagy and inhibits fusion of autophagosome and lysosome
  in CRC cells. (A) Normalized intensity values of upregulated and downregulated proteins
  in HCT116 cells treated with OXI (30 μM) were shown in heat map. (B) KEGG pathway
  and GO analyses of changed proteins in A. (C) Western blotting analysis of LC3 turnover,
  ATG5 and Beclin1 protein levels in OXI-treated CRC cells. (D) LC3 puncta in RKO
  and HCT116 cells were detected by immunofluorescent analysis after treatment of
  DMSO or OXI (30 μM). (E) Quantification of LC3 puncta. Scale bars, 10 μm. (F) Western
  blotting analysis of LC3 turnover in HCT116 and RKO cells transfected with siATG5
  or siScramble and treated with OXI (30 μM). (G) Western blotting analysis of LC3
  turnover, p62 and ubiquitinated proteins in HCT116 and RKO cells treated with OXI
  (30 μM) in combination with CQ (10 μM) for 24 h. (H) IF analysis of HCT116 and RKO
  cells transfected with the tandem mRFP-GFP-tagged LC3B plasmids and treated with
  OXI (30 μM). Scale bars, 10 μm. (I) Quantification of the ratio of yellow puncta
  (autophagosome) versus red puncta (autolysosome). (J) The expression of LC3 in xenografts
  was evaluated by IHC. Scale bar: 50 μm. All data are means ± SD.'
