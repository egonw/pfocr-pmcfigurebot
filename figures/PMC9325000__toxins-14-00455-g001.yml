caption: 'Dynamic response of flavonoid biosynthesis pathway genes in C. platycarpus
  under continued herbivory: (A) Pathway map depicting key genes (green color) upregulated
  in C. platycarpus compared to Cajanus cajan assessed earlier in the comparative
  proteome profiling during herbivory (obtained from proteome data; Rathinam et al.,
  2020 []. C4H: Cinnamate-4-hydroxylase, CHS: Chalcone synthase, CHI: Chalcone flavanone
  isomerase, F3H: Flavanone 3-hydroxylase involved in the anti-herbivore response
  of C. platycarpus; Log2FC in parenthesis indicates the upregulation of the respective
  genes in the wild relative based on differential proteomic analysis vis a vis cultivated
  pigeonpea (B) Experimental setup used to understand the dynamic changes in flavonoid
  pathway genes and metabolites under continued herbivory in the wild relative; (C)
  qRT-PCR analyses of the herbivore- challenged samples depicting the response of
  flavonoid biosynthesis genes in C. platycarpus.'

  in Cajanus platycarpus (Benth.) Offers Novel Insights on the Reprogramming and Role
  of Flavonoid Biosynthesis Pathway.
