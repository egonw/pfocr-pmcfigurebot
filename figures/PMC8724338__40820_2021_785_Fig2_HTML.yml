caption: 'Schematic illustration of the significant features of anion-mixed regulation
  involved in transition metal compounds for water-splitting. a Electronegativity.
  b Ideal electronic structure: Schematic illustration of the strategy for band gap
  narrowing through anion substitution (top left); The d-orbital partial density of
  states (d-pdos) of Co in CoS2 and N–CoS2 (bottom left); Calculated redistribution
  of charge density for Fe–Co–P–O (top right, the yellow isosurface indicates electron
  accumulation, while the blue one represents electron depletion); Calculated volcano
