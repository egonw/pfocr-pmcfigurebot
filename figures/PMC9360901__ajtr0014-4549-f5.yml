caption: UBE2L3 up-regulates Snail expression in a GSK-3β dependent manner. A. The
  effect of UBE2L3 expression on the EMT markers (Snail and E-cadherin) was determined
  by immunoblotting. B. Immunoblotting analyses were performed to assess the effect
  of the GSK-3β inhibitor (CHIR 99021) on EMT makers.
article_title: UBE2L3 promotes lung adenocarcinoma invasion and metastasis through
  the GSK-3β/Snail signaling pathway.
