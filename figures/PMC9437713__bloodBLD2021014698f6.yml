caption: PLAG1-S activates imprinted loci to support human HSPCs. (A) Heatmap of top
  10 differentially expressed transcripts in the transcriptome of PLAG1-SOE Lin−CD34+
  HSPCs. (B) Intracellular flow cytometry of components of the PI3K signaling pathway,
  including phospho-S473 AKT, phospho-S2448 mTOR, and phospho-Thr37/46 4EBP1, in PLAG1-SOE
  Lin−CD34+ cells on day 4 of culture. Numbers above PLAG1-SOE bars show the paired
  Student t-test P value relative to control (n = 3, ph-4EBP1 n = 5). (C) Total nucleated
  cell (top) and CD34+ cell (bottom) fold change in Lin−CD34+BFP+ cultures overexpressing
  either PLAG1-S or Luciferase control and treated with 50 nM rapamycin (RAPA), 1
  μM AKT inhibitor (AKTi), or vehicle (DMSO) (n = 4). Student t-test P values in red
  are relative to Cntrl-DMSO and in black are relative to PLAG1-SOE-DMSO. (D) CD34
  positivity in PLAG1-SOE or control HSPCs following 4 and 8 days of ex vivo culture
  with RAPA, AKTi, or vehicle (n = 4). Student t-test P values in red are relative
  to Cntrl-DMSO and in black are relative to PLAG1-SOE-DMSO. (E) OP-Puro incorporation
  by PLAG1-SOE HSPCs cultured in the presence of RAPA, AKTi, or vehicle on day 4 of
  culture (n = 4). (F) Schematic of the imprinted human DLK1/MEG3 locus, which encodes
  miRNA mega-clusters miR127/136 (7 miRNAs) and miR-379/410 (39 miRNAs). (G) RNA-seq
  read tracks for miRNA transcripts from this locus detected in PLAG1-SOE HSPCs. (H)
  Overlap of the PLAG1-S overexpression gene set enrichment map (P < .025) to signatures
  of miR-127-5p and miR-127-3p validated targets (Mann-Whitney U test, P < .05). (I-J)
  Schematic of lentivectors used for dual PLAG1-S overexpression and miR127-5p inhibition
  via a sponge consisting of multiple bulged 26-mer target sequences (miR127TB) or
  miR127 overexpression. (I) CD34+ cell fold change ex vivo when PLAG1-S and the miR127-5p
  inhibitor are coexpressed in Lin−CD34+ cells (n = 3). (J) CD34+ cell fold change
  ex vivo when miR127 is overexpressed in Lin−CD34+ cells (n = 3); and OP-Puro incorporation
  Lin−CD34+ cells overexpressing miR127 (n = 3). Data are presented as average ± SEM
  unless otherwise indicated. Each point represents an individual CB unit. ***P <
  .005, **P < .01, *P < .05. n.s., not significant. See also supplemental Figure 6.
