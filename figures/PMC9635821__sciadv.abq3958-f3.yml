figure_title: Analysis of the metabolic flux patterns across PLFAs
caption: NMDS (A) and cluster analysis of modeled central C metabolic fluxes (B) based
  on 13C incorporation patterns into PLFA. To compare the observations with pure culture
  studies, the results for B. licheniformis and P. fluorescens from the study by Wu
  et al. () and S. pungens from the study by Scandellari et al. () are displayed (see
  the Supplementary Materials). Cluster analysis was based on the average Euclidean
  distance of fluxes between PLFAs. The heatmap shows the activity of the different
  pathways for individual PLFAs with red for pathway activities above and blue below
  the mean value. v1 to v18 and br1 to br8 are reactions in the model of the central
  C metabolic network (fig. 1). TCA, tricarboxylic acid.
