caption: RECQL4 suppresses radiation‐induced anti‐liver cancer immune response through
  cGAS‐STING signaling in dendritic cells. A) Bubble plot of cell type enrichment
  analysis based on scRNA‐seq. B) Western blotting analysis of STING, p‐STING, TBK1,
  p‐TBK1, IRF3, and p‐IRF3. C,D) Growth curves of primary tumors (C) and secondary
  tumors (D) in STING‐cKO mice in different treatment groups. E) Proposed working
  model of RECQL4. RECQL4 repairs DNA damage caused by RT to HCC, reduces the production
  and release of dsDNA, and inhibits the cGAS‐STING signaling in dendritic cells,
  thereby suppressing antigen presentation and effector T cell function of dendritic
  cells, reducing IFN release, weakening HCC radio‐sensitivity, and blocking the anticancer
  effect of RT activation.
