caption: Effect of hypoxia on UC-MSCs is linked to the mTOR pathway. UC-MSCs underwent
  control (21% O2 and INK-128) and experimental conditions (5% O2, <1% O2, 10 μM CoCl2,
  and 250 μMCoCl2) for 24 and 48 h, after which protein analysis was carried out via
  Western blot. (A–C) Protein band quantification of two mTORC1 targets (p-4EBP1/4EBP1
  and p-S6K1/S6K1) and a mTORC2 target (p-Akt/Akt), normalized to the loading control
  calnexin (CNX). The ratio between phosphorylated and total forms could be used to
  infer protein function. (D) Representative immunoblot of the total and of the respective
  phosphorylated form of the 4EBP1, S6K1, and Akt proteins. Results are represented
  as means with SEM of a minimum of 3 independent experiments. Statistical significance
  considered when * p < 0.05%, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001.
