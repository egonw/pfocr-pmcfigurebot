caption: Schematic representation of major molecular mechanisms involved in glioblastoma
  development. Binding of EGF to the EGFR results in activation of numerous downstream
  signaling pathways, including SOS1, GRB2 and PI3K-Akt-mTOR. Various extracellular
  factors lead to NF-κB activation. NF-κB dimers (p65-p50) are inactive in normal
  cells due to binding to IκB inhibitory factors in the cytoplasm, which blocks the
  nuclear localization sequence and prevents the transfer of NF-κB into the nucleus.
  In the nucleus, NF-κB dimers bind to κB-sites in the regulatory regions of genes
  participating in a wide range of cellular processes. Ras is a key player in the
  RTK-mediated PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways. The activation of all isoforms
  of RAS protein by the exchange of GDP with GTP results in the activation of MAPKs
  that also activate downstream ERK via phosphorylation. PI3K-activated AKT phosphorylates
  FOXO proteins at 3 serine/threonine residues, resulting in the promotion of nuclear
  exclusion and inactivation of the transactivation-dependent (genomic) tumor suppressor
  activities of FOXO proteins in the nucleus. Wnt signaling is inactivated in the
  absence of Wnt ligands. When inactive, cytoplasmic β-catenin is degraded by a β-catenin
  destruction complex, which includes Axin, adenomatosis polyposis coli, protein phosphatase
  2A, GSK3 and casein kinase 1α. Phosphorylation of β-catenin within this complex
  by casein kinase and GSK3 targets it for ubiquitination and subsequent proteolytic
  destruction by the proteasomal apparatus. The active Wnt signaling pathway activates
  β-catenin, which is shuttled into the nucleus, leading to transcriptional activation
  of WNT signaling-target genes. SOS1, Son of Sevenless 1; GRB2l, growth factor receptor
