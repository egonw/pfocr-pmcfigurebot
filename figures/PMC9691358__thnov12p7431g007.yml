caption: Activation of the mTORC1-ITGA5-EFNB2 signaling pathway is associated with
  malignant progression and poor prognosis of LSCC. (A-C) H-score statistical analysis
  of p-S6, EFNB2, and ITGA5 IHC staining from LSCC tissues and ANM tissues (A), T1/T2
  and T3/T4 LSCC tissues (B), or with lymph node metastasis (N+) and non-lymph node
  metastasis (N0) LSCC tissues (C). Error bars, mean ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01;
  ***P < 0.001. (D) Representative IHC images of p-S6, ITGA5, and EFNB2 staining from
  the ANM tissues and LSCC tissues. Scale bar, 200 µm (low-magnification), 40 µm (high-magnification).
  (E) The correlation between p-S6, ITGA5, and EFNB2 expression of LSCC tissues. The
  square in the upper right corner demonstrates the Pearson's correlation value between
  the indicated genes. The scatterplot matrix fitted trend lines for the indicated
  genes are shown at the square in the lower left corner. (F) Diagnostic ROC curves
  of p-S6, ITGA5, and EFNB2 expression based on the H-scores of 94 LSCC tissues. (G-H)
  Diagnostic ROC curves of ITGA5, and EFNB2 expression based on the TCGA (G) and the
  GSE127165 datasets (H). (I-K) Kaplan-Meier analysis of the association between overall
  survival and p-S6 (I), ITGA5 (J), or EFNB2 (K) protein levels in 94 LSCC patients.
  According to the median H-score of IHC staining, p-S6, ITGA5, and EFNB2 expression
  levels were divided into high (n = 47) and low (n = 47) subgroups.
