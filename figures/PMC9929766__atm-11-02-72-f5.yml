caption: LBP may alleviate H/R-induced apoptosis and mitochondrial injury through
  the SIRT3/CypD pathway. (A) Flow cytometry was used to detect the apoptotic rate
  of H9c2 cells. (B) Western blotting was used to analyze the protein expressions
  of apoptotic factors, including caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax. (C) ELISA was used to
  evaluate the level of LDH released. (D) The effects of LBP and the SIRT3 inhibitor
  3-TYP on Na+-K+-ATPase activity, Ca2+-ATPase activity, and NO levels. N=3, mean
  ± standard deviation; *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.001. One-way ANOVA was used
  for analysis of variance among multiple groups. Tukey’s test was used for pairwise
  comparisons between groups. LBP, Lycium barbarum polysaccharide; H/R, hypoxia/reoxygenation;
  ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; NO, nitric
  oxide; ANOVA, analysis of variance.
