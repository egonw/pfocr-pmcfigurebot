caption: 'The regulation of Insig2 by gp78 is vital to lipogenesis in primary hepatocytes
  derived from TGM. (A) Oil red O staining of primary hepatocytes. (B) Western blot
  showing the expression levels of lipogenesis pathway regulatory proteins in primary
  hepatocytes of Con vs TGM after knocking down gp78 and (C) relative protein levels
  (n = 3). (D) Chase experiment showing that gp78 regulated Insig2 by affecting Insig2
  stability. (E) Relative Insig2 protein expression of (D). (F) Western blot showing
  the expression levels of Insig2 in primary hepatocytes of Con vs TGM after treated
  or not with MG132 (10 μM final concentration) for 12h before harvest and (G) relative
  protein levels (n = 6). (H) Immunoprecipitation (IP) and western blotting analyses
  were performed to verify that Insig2 were degraded in ubiquitin pathway. (UB: Ubiquitin,
  WCL: Whole cell lysate.) *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001.'
