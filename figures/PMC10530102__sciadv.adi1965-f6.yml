figure_title: Activation of the cGAS-STING pathway by MIDRS after response to SNVs
  in mtDNA contributes to PDT-mediated immunotherapy
caption: '(A) Reverse-transcription fluorescence quantitative PCR analysis of mRNA
  levels of cGAS-STING–related genes in B16 and RAW 264.7 cells treated with 50 nM
  MIDRSWT or MIDRSMT. n = 3 biologically independent samples. (B) Analysis of cGAS-STING–related
  protein expression in B16 and RAW 264.7 cells treated with 50 nM MIDRSWT or MIDRSMT.
  n = 3 biologically independent samples. (C to F) Levels of cGAMP (C), IFN-β (D),
  ATP (E), and HMGB1 (F) secreted by B16 and RAW 264.7 cells after treatment with
  50 nM MIDRSWT or MIDRSMT. n = 3, data show mean ± SD. P < 0.001 by Student’s t test.
  (G and H) Flow cytometry analysis of DC maturation after treatment with culture
  supernatants of B16 and RAW 264.7 cells incubated with 50 nM MIDRSWT or MIDRSMT
  (n = 3). For (A) and (C) to (F), statistical analysis was calculated via two-tailed
  unpaired Student’s t tests (**P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001; ns: no significance).'
