caption: Single-cell RNA-seq analysis reveals specific metabolic signatures of macrophages
  in the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. (A) Heatmap showing the selected metabolic
  pathway activity of immune cell types at different stages of pulmonary fibrosis.
  Red indicates strong metabolic activity. (B) Heatmap showing the selected metabolic
  activity of the different subclusters of macrophages at different stages of pulmonary
  fibrosis. (C) Dot plot depicting the percentage of cells expressing the gene and
  the expression levels of genes in the cells expressing these genes. Genes with most
  variation level related to specific metabolic pathways were selected.
