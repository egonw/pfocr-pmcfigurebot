caption: 'PhosTag‐based Western blot probed for YAP reveals increased levels of unphosphorylated
  (downshift) YAP in HEK293A cells in response to cyclic 0.1 Hz 200 mbar hydrostatic
  pressure (+) compared to control (−).PhosTag‐based Western blot probed for TAZ reveals
  increased levels of unphosphorylated (downshift) TAZ in HEK293A cells in response
  to cyclic 0.1 Hz 200 mbar hydrostatic pressure (+) compared to control (−).Western
  blots from cell lysates as in (A) and (B) show total protein levels in control (−)
  and in cell lysates obtained from cells exposed to hydrostatic pressure (+) stimulation
  in HEK293A cells. Note the decrease in the inhibitory p127 YAP signal as well as
  increase in YAP/TAZ targets CTGF and CYR61 levels upon hydrostatic pressure.PhosTag‐based
