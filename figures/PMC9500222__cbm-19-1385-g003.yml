caption: Caspase-8K14R regulates the expression of genes associated with proliferation
  and apoptosis. (A, B) qRT-PCR assays were performed to detect the mRNA levels of
  relevant genes in A549 and SPCA1 cells after transfection with the constructed plasmids
  (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01).
article_title: A causal variant rs3769823 in 2q33.1 involved in apoptosis pathway
  leading to a decreased risk of non-small cell lung cancer.
