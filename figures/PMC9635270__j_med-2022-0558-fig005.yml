caption: Knockdown of HOXA10 reduced cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis in
  EC cells. (a) The western blot showed HOXA10 expression in Eca-109 cells. (b) The
  cell viability in Eca-109 cells was determined by CCK-8 assay. (c) The cell apoptosis
  in Eca-109 cells was detected by Annexin V-FITC assay.

  cancer via activating p38/ERK signaling pathway.
