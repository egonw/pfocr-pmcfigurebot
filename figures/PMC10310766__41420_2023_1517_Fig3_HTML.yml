figure_title: The noncanonical pathway of p53 that regulates ferroptosis
caption: Following redox stress, p53 enhances the activities of ALOX12 and ALOXE3
  by downregulating SLC7A11. Then, ALOX12 and ALOXE3 are separately released and subsequently
  oxidize membrane PUFAs, to produce lipid peroxides and initiate ferroptosis. When
  lipid peroxidation damage is low and can be repaired, p53 targets IPLA2Î², which
  eliminates acyl tails from lipids and releases oxidized fatty acids. The latter
  are further detoxified by antioxidants in the cytoplasm, and thus ferroptosis is
  inhibited. When the damage persists or is too severe, p53 induces ferroptosis and
  thereby eliminates damaged cells. The green arrow indicates the stimulatory effect
  and the red arrow indicates the inhibitory effect.
