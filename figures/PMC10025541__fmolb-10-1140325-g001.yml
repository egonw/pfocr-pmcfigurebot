caption: The relationship between intestinal flora, inflammation, colorectal cancer
  (CRC), and the composition of the tumor immune microenvironment. Intestinal commensal
  bacteria (such as Fusobacterium nucleatum) promote the activation of NF-ÎºB and the
  expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines through TLR/MyD88 signaling on tumor-infiltrating
  cells, which can directly regulate the HIF pathway and promote the expression of
  VEGF, leading to angiogenesis in tumor tissues. In addition, Fusobacterium nucleatum
  can also promote p38 or MAPK signal-mediated pro-inflammatory responses, promoting
  the formation of CRC. Polyketide synthase-expressing (pks+) Escherichia coli can
  aggravate colon inflammation and malignant cell transformation by destroying the
  DNA of colon cells. The tumor immune microenvironment is mainly composed of T cells,
  tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor
  cells (MDSC), dendritic cells (DC), tumor-associated Neutrophils (TAN), NK cells.
