caption: Molecular responses to ionic and osmotic aspects of salt stress. Upon exposure
  to high salinity, plants suffer both ionic and osmotic stress, the signals of which
  are thought to be sensed and transduced via distinct pathways. For ionic stress
  signaling (left panel), apoplastic Na+ binds to GIPC sphingolipids in the plasma
  membrane and triggers Ca2+ influx via a yet unknown mechanism. Elevated cytosolic
  Ca2+ activates SOS signaling pathway and promotes Na+ extrusion out of cells, driven
  by the proton gradient created by the plasma membrane H+-ATPases. The NHX Na+/H+
  exchangers and vacuolar H+-ATPase regulate vacuolar Na+ partitioning under saline
  conditions. Plants may sense hyperosmotic stress through multiple pathways (right
  panel). For example, the mechanosensitive channel OSCA1 may sense membrane tension
  changes and start Ca2+ influx. The C2 domain-containing BONZAI1 (BON) proteins respond
  to turgor reduction, regulate Ca2+ signals, and repress NLR signaling which antagonizes
  ABA signaling. Besides, hyperosmotic stress also activates RAF-SnRK2 phosphorylation
  cascades, and controls stress responses together with ABA and Ca2+signaling.
