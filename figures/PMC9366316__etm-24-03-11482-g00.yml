caption: Rg1 increases the viability of ox-LDL-induced HUVECs. (A) Chemical structure
  of Rg1. (B) CCK-8 assay was used to detect the viability of HUVECs treated with
  Rg1. (C) CCK-8 assay was used to examine the viability of ox-LDL-induced HUVECs
  treated with Rg1. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001. CCK-8, Cell Counting Kit-8; ox-LDL,
  oxidized low-density lipoprotein; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell;
  Rg1, ginsenoside Rg1.
article_title: Ginsenoside Rg1 ameliorates apoptosis, senescence and oxidative stress
  in ox-LDL-induced vascular endothelial cells via the AMPK/SIRT3/p53 signaling pathway.
