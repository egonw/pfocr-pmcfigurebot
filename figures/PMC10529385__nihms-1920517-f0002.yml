figure_title: Enrichment of genes encoding cell adhesion molecules and extracellular
  matrix proteins in adherent ALL cells
caption: (A) Schema of ex vivo co-culture of ALL with MSCs. Five B-ALL cell lines
  and 11 B-ALL patient samples were co-cultured with hTERT-MSCs and primary MSCs,
  respectively. The RNA isolated from ALL-only, Adh ALL, and Nonadh ALL cells was
  subjected to RNA-seq.(B) PCA plot for five ALL cell lines.(C) PCA plot for 11 primary
  B-ALLs.(D) Common DEGs in both cell lines and primary patient samples.(E) Pathway
  analysis of the upregulated DEGs in Adh ALL was performed by using the Reactome
  database. NES, normalized enrichment score. Red color, ECM-associated pathways.
  Blue color, integrin-associated pathway.(F) Enrichment plots of integrin cell surface
  and reactome extracellular matrix organization pathways. FDR, false discovery rate.(G)
  Enriched integrin family genes in 11 patient Adh ALL samples compared to Nonadh
  ALL samples (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05). Dots, individual value. Bar, mean
  with SD.(H) Enriched ECM genes in 11 patient Adh ALL samples compared to Nonadh
  ALL samples (FDR < 0.05). Dots, individual value. Bar, mean with SD. Statistical
  testing was performed using two-tailed Studentâ€™s t test, ****p < 0.0001, ***p <
  0.0005, **p < 0.005, *p < 0.05. See also .
