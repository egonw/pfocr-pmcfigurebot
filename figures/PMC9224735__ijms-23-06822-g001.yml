caption: 'Characteristics of circDCLRE1C: (A) The schematic representation of circDCLRE1C’s
  formation. The back-spliced junction (BSJ) of circDCLRE1C was validated by PCR using
  a divergent primer, followed by Sanger sequencing. (B,C) Northern blot analysis
  for the detection of circDCLRE1C expression in HD11 cells treated with or without
  RNase R, respectively; divergent primers amplified circDCLRE1C from complementary
  DNA (cDNA), but not from genomic DNA (gDNA). (D) The relative expression levels
  of circDCLRE1C in the nucleus and cytoplasm were detected by qRT-PCR. (E,F) The
  expression of cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ) and circDCLRE1C, respectively,
  in the spleens of non-infected and infected chickens, was detected by qRT-PCR; n
  = 4. (G) qRT-PCR analysis of the expression levels of cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, and
  IFN-γ) and circDCLRE1C, respectively, induced by LPS stimulation in HD11 cells.
  Data are presented as means ± SD (n = 3 biologically independent samples). ** p
  < 0.01; *** p < 0.001 (Student’s t-test).'
