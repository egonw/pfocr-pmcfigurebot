caption: 'MiR-214b-3p mimics partly reversed the effects of circDCLRE1C in the inflammation
  responses: (A) MiR-214b-3p mimics could rescue the increase in the STAT3 mRNA expression
  caused by overexpression of circDCLRE1C in HD11 cells stimulated with LPS. (B) High
  expression levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ induced by overexpression of circDCLRE1C
  were rescued by co-transfection with circDCLRE1C and miR-214b-3p mimics in the inflammatory
  response. (C,D) The Ov-circDCLRE1C-induced increase in cell apoptosis was reversed
  by co-transfection with ov-circDCLRE1C and miR-214b-3p mimics. Data are presented
  as means ± SD (n = 3 biologically independent samples). * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01;
  *** p < 0.001 (Student’s t-test). (E) Graphical abstract: graphical diagram of circDCLRE1C
  promoting LPS-induced inflammation and apoptosis by sponging miR-214b-3p and regulating
  STAT3 expression.'
