caption: Proline cycle and its basic metabolic links in the human cell. Proline released
  during collagen catabolism can feed back to collagen resynthesis, or, through the
  proline cycle, it may be used for energetic purposes, redox balance, parametabolic
  regulation, or anaplerosis. PRO—proline, P5C—pyrroline-5-carboxylate, ORN—ornithine,
  GLN—glutamine, GLU—glutamate, αKG—alpha-ketoglutarate, PEPD—prolidase, POX/PRODH—proline
  oxidase/proline dehydrogenase, PYCR 1/2/3—pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1/2/3,
  MMPs—metalloproteinases, PPP—pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle—tricarboxylic
  acid cycle. Created with BioRender.com, accessed on 2 February 2022.
