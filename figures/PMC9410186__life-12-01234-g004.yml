caption: Response of Syn7942 cells to heterologous expression of Syn-A-4-8. (A) Volcano
  map of differentially expressed genes under normal culture conditions. Red dots
  indicate up-regulation and blue dots indicate down-regulation. The abscissa represents
  the logarithm of the fold change of gene expression, and the ordinate represents
  the statistical significance of the change in gene expression. Differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs) were screened based on a fold change  >  1.5 and p-value < 0.05. (B)
  KEGG pathway-enrichment scatter plot under normal culture conditions. The abscissa
  represents the Rich factor. The larger the Rich factor, the greater the enrichment
  degree. The ordinate represents the pathway name. The size of each dot indicates
  the number of DEGs in this pathway, and the color of each dot corresponds to different
  p-values. The smaller the p-value, the more significant the enrichment. (C) Volcano
  map of differentially expressed genes under 290-millimolar NaCl stress. (D) KEGG
  pathway-enrichment scatter plot under 290-millimolar NaCl stress.
