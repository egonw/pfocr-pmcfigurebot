caption: 'The influence of Vinco on the expression of the oncogene Src, the reprogramming
  gene Oct4, and the proteins related to the regulation by PI3K/AKT signaling pathway
  in HCC cells. HLE, Bel 7402 and PLC/PRF/5 cells were treated with Vinco (80 µg/mL)
  for 48 h, and the expression and localization of Src (a) and Oct4 (b) in these cells
  were observed by laser confocal microscopy. (c, d) HLE, Bel 7402 and PLC/PRF/5 cells
  were treated with Vinco (80 µg/mL) or the PI3K inhibitor Ly294002 (2 µmol/L) or
  co-treated with Vinco (80 µg/mL) and Ly294002 (2 µmol/L) for 48 h, and the expression
  of pAKT (Ser473), Src and Oct4 were detected by Western blotting. The bar graphs
  on the right showed relative expressed quantity of these proteins, with P < 0.05
  indicating statistical significance; **P < 0.01 vs. Ly294002- treated groups. The
  images are representative of at least three independent experiments. Vinco: vincosamide;
  HCC: hepatocellular carcinoma; DAPI: 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride.'
