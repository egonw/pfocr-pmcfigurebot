caption: miR-664a-3p regulates aortic valve calcification via Bmp2 in calcific aortic
  valve disease mice. (a, b) RT-qPCR was performed to measure the miR-664a-3p and
  Bmp2 expression after upregulation of miR-664a-3p and Bmp2 separately or simultaneously
  in the aortic valves of mice. (c) Bmp2, Runx2, Mst2, and Osterix expressions were
  detected by western blotting after the upregulation of miR-664a-3p and Bmp2 levels
  separately or simultaneously in the aortic valves of mice. Quantitative analyses
  of the protein bands are shown on the right. (d) HE staining of the aortic valve
  of mice in different groups. Scale bar, 400 μm. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P
  < 0.001.
