caption: Knockdown of PTP1B expression restores the viability of ox-LDL-induced HUVECs.
  (A) mRNA and (B) protein expression level of PTP1B in HUVECs with or without ox-LDL
  treatment were detected by RT-qPCR and western blotting assays. (C) mRNA and (D)
  protein expression levels of PTP1B in HUVECs transfected with or without sh-PTP1B
  were detected by RT-qPCR and western blotting assays. (E) Cell viability was measured
  using Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. (F) LDH level was analyzed using a corresponding
  kit. Results represent the mean Â± SD. **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001. PTP1B, protein tyrosine
  phosphatase 1B; ox-LDL, oxidized low-density lipoprotein; RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR; sh, short-hairpin; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; NC, negative control.
article_title: PTP1B inhibition ameliorates inflammatory injury and dysfunction in
  ox-LDL-induced HUVECs by activating the AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway via negative
  regulation of KLF2.
