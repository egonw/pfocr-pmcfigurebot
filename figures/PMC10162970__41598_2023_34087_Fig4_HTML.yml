caption: Molecular analysis of ccRCC patients according to PDK2 and PDK3 tumor expression.
  (A) Kaplan–Meier curves of overall survival based on PDK2/PDK3 expression in the
  ccRCC cohort. Patients with high PDK2/PDK3 protein expression and patients with
  low PDK2/PDK3 protein expression had significantly different time to recurrence
  (p = 0.016). (B) PanCancer Pathway signature in ccRCC tumor samples. Note PI3K pathway
  as most differentially expressed signalling pathway in high PDK2/PDK3 protein expression
  vs low PDK2 and PDK3 protein expression tumors. (C) Box plot of PI3K pathway score
  in high PDK2 and PDK3 protein expression vs low PDK2 and PDK3 protein expression
  tumors. (B, C) Data is represented in a logarithmic scale (Log2) and obtained from
  11 ccRCC tumor samples. (D) Cell type score in ccRCC tumor samples using Immune
  Exhaustion panel. Note CD8 T cell exhaustion cell type as one of the higher enrichments
  in high PDK2/PDK3 protein expression vs low PDK2/PDK3 protein expression tumors.
  (E) Box plot of exhausted CD8 score in high PDK2/PDK3 protein expression vs low
  PDK2/PDK3 protein expression tumors. (D, E) Data is represented in a logarithmic
  scale (Log2) and obtained from 18 ccRCC tumor samples. Statistically significant
  results (p < 0.05) are marked with an asterisk.
