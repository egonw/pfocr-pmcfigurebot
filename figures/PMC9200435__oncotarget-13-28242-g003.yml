caption: Activation of KRAS and mutations of TP53 results in a cascade of downstream
  effects that generates biosynthetic precursors to drive various anabolic pathways,
  including the non-oxidative arm of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and the hexosamine
  biosynthesis pathway (HBP). In addition, KRAS activation affects glutamine metabolism,
  increasing the NADPH/NADP+ ratio and increasing turnover of glutathione (GSH) via
  reduction of its oxidized form. Branched chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism is also
  catalyzed in the setting of KRAS activation via increased BCAT2 (branched chain
  amino acid transaminase 2) activity. The ultimate outcome of these aberrant pathways
  is enhanced nutrient salvaging and further promotion of neoplastic processes. Reprinted
