figure_title: RECQL4 functions in a separate pathway from REV1 and is degraded following
  DNA crosslinks
caption: (A) RECQL4 levels decrease following cisplatin treatment. U2OS cells were
  incubated with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide in the presence or absence of 50 μg/ml cisplatin.
  Protein extracts were analyzed by western blot for endogenous RECQL4 protein levels
  (α-RECQL4) or a loading control, Tubulin (γ-Tubulin), at the indicated time points.
  Quantification of the proportion of RECQL4 remaining relative to time 0 (before
  CHX addition) and the loading control, Tubulin, are plotted on the graph in log
  scale. Each experiment was performed in triplicate with standard error plotted (Raw
  densitometry data in Sheets A-C in ). (B) RECQL4 protein levels decrease following
  acetaldehyde treatment. U2OS cells were incubated with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide in
  the presence or absence of 50 μg/ml acetaldehyde. Protein extracts were analyzed
  by western blot for endogenous RECQL4 protein levels (α-RECQL4) or a loading control,
  GAPDH (α-GAPDH), at the indicated time points. Quantification of the proportion
  of RECQL4 remaining relative to time 0 (before CHX addition) and the loading control,
  GAPDH, are plotted on the graph in log scale. Each experiment was performed in triplicate
  with standard error plotted (Raw densitometry data in Sheets D-F in ). (C) Cisplatin
  exposed U2OS cells exhibit decreased viability when both RECQL4 and REV1 are knocked
  down by siRNA. MTS assay was performed on after 72 hr exposure to the indicated
  dose of cisplatin. Western is shown to confirmed knockdown of proteins, note since
  RECQL4 and REV1 are of similar size, the same samples were loaded twice to detect
  RECQL4 and REV1. Each experiment was performed three times with mean and standard
  errors plotted (Unprocessed data in ). (D) Decreased cell viability following cisplatin
  exposure when both RECQL4 and REV1 are knocked down. Clonogenic survival assay with
  siControl (scrambled siCon), siRECQL4, siREV1, and siRECQL4 siREV1 treated cells
  with or without cisplatin. Each condition was plated in triplicate for each experiment
  and the experiment was performed three times with mean and standard errors plotted
  (Colony quantification in ).
