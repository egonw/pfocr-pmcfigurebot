caption: Metabonomic analysis of liver tissue in the sham group, OVX group and E2
  group. (A) Coenrichment KEGG pathways of transcriptomic and metabonomic analysis
  in both the OVX group vs. the E2 group and the OVX group vs. the sham group comparisons.
  (B) Differentially expressed metabolites in the linoleic acid metabolism pathway.
  (C) Correlation heatmap of clinical indicators and the relevant differentially expressed
  metabolites. (D) Correlation heatmap of the intestinal flora and the relevant differentially
  expressed metabolites. (All error bars, mean values ± SD, p values were determined
  by unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test of n = 3 independent biological experiments.
  *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001).
article_title: 17β-Estradiol protects female rats from bilateral oophorectomy-induced
  nonalcoholic fatty liver disease induced by improving linoleic acid metabolism alteration
  and gut microbiota disturbance.
