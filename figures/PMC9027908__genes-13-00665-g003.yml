caption: Functional enrichment analysis heat map with hierarchical clustering of the
  significantly enriched KEGG pathways. The coloured scale bar represents LOG (p-value)
  from 0 to –15 where red indicates more significance and yellow indicates less significance.
  The background colour of the heat map or 0 of the scale bars represent no significance.
  Each row represents a KEGG pathway, and each column represents a miRNA. The miRNA
  clustering tree or dendrogram is shown at the top and the KEGG pathway clustering
  tree or dendrogram is shown on the right.
