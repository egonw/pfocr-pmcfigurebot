figure_title: Immune signaling in neurons recruits and activates microglia
caption: (A) Schematic of spatial transcriptomics experiment. CK (n = 3) and CK-p25
  (n = 4) were induced for 2 weeks. Coronal brain sections were stained and imaged
  for γH2AX and then sequenced. (B) UMAP of capture areas from all samples. Leiden
  clusters are indicated by color and number. Each dot represents one capture area.
  (C) Leiden clusters superimposed onto a CK-p25 brain slice used for spatial transcriptomics.
  (D) UMAP indicating the density of γH2AX+ capture areas. (E) γH2AX+ capture areas
  identified in one CK-p25 brain slice. (F) Spatial clusters, γH2AX+ capture areas,
  and reactive microglia signature gene expression in one CK-p25 sample. (G) Schematic
  of neuronal p65 knockdown experiment. CK-p25 mice received retro-orbital injections
  of scramble shRNA–red fluorescent protein (RFP) adeno-associated virus (AAV) or
  shp65-RFP AAV. CK mice received retro-orbital injections of phosphate-buffered saline
  (PBS). Mice recovered for 2 weeks before being taken off dox. Brains were collected
  at the 2-week time point. (H) Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain
  reaction of immune genes in sorted RFPhi γH2AXhi nuclei. (I) Representative images
  of Iba1 in CK, scramble, and p65kd cortex. (J) Quantification of (left to right)
  Iba1+ soma area, number Iba1+ per image, average branch length per Iba1+ cell, and
  number end points per Iba1+ cell. Each data point represents one image. Two images
  were taken per mouse. (K) Heatmap of differentially expressed genes from p65 versus
  scramble contrast. (L) Up-regulated and down-regulated Gene Ontology (biological
  pathway) terms identified through GSEA of p65kd versus scramble contrast. (L) Heatmap
  of significantly up-regulated and down-regulated genes in PU.1hi nuclei from p65kd
  cortex compared to PU.1hi nuclei from scramble cortex. Error bars represent SEM;
  ****P < 0.0001, ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01, and *P < 0.05. Student’s t test (H). One-way
  ANOVA followed by Holm-Sidak’s test for multiple comparisons (I). (H) Scramble (n
  = 5), p65kd (n = 5). (I) CK (n = 7), scramble (n = 5), p65kd (n = 6).
