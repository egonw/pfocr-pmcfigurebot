caption: Reduced IQGAP2 promoted cell growth in bladder cancer cell lines. IQGAP2
  knockdown in TCCSUP (A) and T24 (D) was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Knockdown
  of IQGAP2 in TCCSUP (B,C) and T24 (E,F) led to significant increase in proliferation
  in cell monolayer and spheroid growth. IQGAP2 overexpression in T24 (G) was confirmed
  by Western blot analysis. Overexpression of IQGAP2 in T24 (H,I) led to significant
  decrease in proliferation in cell monolayer and spheroid growth. One example in
  triplicate is shown; bar chart presents the means of replicates ± SEM from three
  different experiments; * p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01, and *** p ≤ 0.001; Student’s t-test
  (two-tailed, unpaired) was used for comparison of means.
