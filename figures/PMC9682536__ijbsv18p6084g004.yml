caption: HNRNPK/CLCN3 axis facilitated LUAD progression through interaction between
  tumor cells and CAFs. (a) Primary human CAFs and paired NFs were extracted from
  fresh LUAD samples. The expression of CAF markers was increased in CAFs compared
  to NFs, which was in accord with the typical characteristic of CAFs. (b) The levels
  of CLCN3 were detected in the culture supernatants of LUAD cells, and the data indicated
  that decreased extracellular CLCN3 secretion could be induced by HNRNPK knockdown.
  (c-e) The supernatants (HNRNPK knockdown and control) of LUAD cells were incubated
  with CAFs for 24 h. We confirmed that the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway was significantly
  enriched in CAFs. (f) The levels of p-AKT, α-SMA, FAP, and COL1A1 were decreased
  when CAFs were stimulated with the supernatants of HNRNPK-knockdown cells. After
  CLCN3 knockdown in CAFs, the levels of p-AKT, α-SMA, FAP, and COL1A1 were also effectively
  inhibited. (g) Due to the activation inhibition, the CAFs co-cultured with HNRNPK-knockdown
  LUAD cells were then considered as inhibited CAFs. The analysis by ELISA revealed
  that the TGF-β1 production of inhibited CAFs was significantly decreased (n = 7).
  (h) The supernatants of inhibited CAFs attenuated the expression of HNRNPK protein
  in the H1299 nucleus, and the attenuation effect was reversed after TGF-β1 treatment.
  (i) The supernatants of inhibited CAFs attenuated the fluorescence intensity of
  HNRNPK in the H1299 nucleus, which was also reversed after the addition of exogenous
  TGF-β1. (j, k) The supernatants of inhibited CAFs markedly attenuated the clonogenicity
  and invasion of LUAD cells, and this phenomenon was further reversed after the addition
  of TGF-β1 (n = 3). *P < 0.05.
