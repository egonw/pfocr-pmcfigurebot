caption: DSC2 inhibits HCC tumor growth in vivo. (A) LM3 cells transfected with vector
  and overExp-DSC2 were injected into the right back of 5-week-old male nude mice
  with 6 rats in each group. After 28 days, the tumor was collected, and the volume
  and weight of the tumor were measured. (B) 7721 cells transfected with shControl
  and shRNA-DSC2-1 were injected into the right back of 5-week-old male nude mice
  with 6 rats in each group. After 28 days, the tumor was collected, and the volume
  and weight of the tumor were measured.
