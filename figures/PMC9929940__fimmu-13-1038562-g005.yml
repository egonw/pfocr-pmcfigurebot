caption: Schematic diagram of iNKT-licensed dendritic cell activation (1). EDV-COVID-αGC
  injected i.m. in mice (2), phagocytosed by dendritic cells (DC), degraded in lysosomes,
  (3.1) αGC released from EDVs, (3.2) CD1d binds to αGC, (3.3) CD1d:αGC complex displayed
  on DC cell surface, (4.1) spike polypeptides also released from EDVs, (4.2) MHC
  Class II binds to the S-peptides, (4.3) display them on same DC cell surface (5).
  iNKT semi-invariant T cell receptor binds to CD1d/αGC complex (6), rapidly secretes
  IFNγ which triggers upregulation of CD40 ligand in DCs inducing DC maturation/activation
  with increased costimulatory capacity through upregulation of CD80, CD86, CCR7,
  MHC Class I molecules, pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 & chemokine CCL17 (7). Binding
  of CD1d:αGC complex to the iNKT TCR triggers perforin release which kills the CD1d/αGC
  complex displaying DCs (8). S-polypeptides are released from dying DCs (9), endocytosed
  by activated CD11c+ DCs and (10) naïve B cells via B cell surface receptor, and
  (11, 12) displayed on each cell surface via MHC Class II (13). MHC Class II/spike
  on DC surface binds to CD4+ TCRβ on CD4+ T follicular helper (TFH) cells, and (14.1)
  these signals induce the TFH cell differentiation and upregulation of chemokine
  receptor CXCR5 and downregulation of CCR7, which allows these cells to migrate to
  the T/B border. (14.2) B cells activated by S-polypeptide engagement of BCR increase
  CCR7 expression and migrates to the T/B follicle border in search of cognate CD4+
  T cells (15). Recognition of the S-peptide/MHC II complex on B cells by the TCRβ
  enables TFH cells (16) to express CD40 ligand and ICOS and (17) secretes the cytokines
  IL-21, IFNγ, IL-4, IL-2, and IL-10. TFH cells are strongly enriched for cells expressing
  the highest levels of IL-21 (18). this cognate help stimulates B cells to undergo
  intense proliferation, induction of Ig class switching, differentiation to plasma-like
  cells capable of secreting all major Ig isotypes (19). Within GCs, B cells undergo
  somatic hypermutation and only B cells with the highest affinity antibody are selected
  (20). These plasma cells secrete high affinity S-specific antibodies that can neutralize
  a variety of S-mutants (21). These B cells differentiate into long-lived memory
  B cells. Throughout this process, IL-21 induces expression of CD25, enabling the
  B cells to respond to IL-2, also derived from TFH cells, which promotes the effect
  of IL-21. Similarly, IL-21 induces expression of IL-6R on PCs, which allows these
  cells to integrate survival signals by IL-6 (22). DCs displaying S-peptides via
  MHC class II also elicit an S-specific CD8+ T cell response.
