caption: Processive PI3K/Akt pathway assembled on IQGAP1. This model demonstrates
  how PI(3,4,5)P3synthesis is scaffolded by the IQGAP1 scaffold complex. Kinases phosphorylating
  different sites on the inositol head of PtdIns are assembled on IQGAP1 in close
  proximity, catalyzing the synthesis of PI(3,4,5)P3 in a step-by-step manner. By
  utilizing PtdIns rather than the existing PI(4,5)P2 pool, the IQGAP1 scaffold complex
  enables rapid PI(3,4,5)P3synthesis and Akt activation in response to stimulation
  on endosomes, which are typically devoid of native PI(4,5)P2. Figure created with
