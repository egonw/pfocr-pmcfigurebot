caption: Comparison of KEGG pathways predicted by PICRUSt. Metabolic pathways by PICRUSt2
  using 16S rRNA gene sequences were predicted from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
  and Genomes (KEGG) Ortholog (KO) database. (A). Heatmap of the 40 s-level classification
  KEGG pathways identified in the intestinal contents. (B). LDA scores calculated
  for the differentially abundant features in the small intestinal bacteria. Selection
  of discriminative microbial pathways between groups was based on an LDA score cutoff
  of 3.0 and differences in the relative abundances of the pathway (converted to log
  base 10) were statistically determined based on a Kruskal–Wallis and pairwise Wilcoxon
  tests. A p-value of <0.05 and a score ≥3.0 were considered significant in Kruskal–Wallis
  and pairwise Wilcoxon tests, respectively, at a significance level of 0.05; n =
  12. The length of the histogram represents the LDA score, i.e., the degree of influence
  of species with significant difference between different groups. (C). Correlation
  analysis of body fat and insulin resistance with major microbial pathways identified.
  The R2 with p < 0.05 value is shown in each cell.
