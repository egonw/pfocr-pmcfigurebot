caption: 'Effects of PB on the hippocampal cytokine response to LPS. At the early
  timepoint, PB treatment suppresses the IL-1α response to LPS in the hippocampus
  compared to vehicle-treated controls. Only the combination of PB and repeated restraint
  stress (RRS) elicits an increase in IL-1β levels compared to Vehicle-RRS animals
  at the early timepoint. At the delayed timepoint, a history of PB treatment elicits
  an increased IL-1β, IL-12 and GM-CSF response to LPS in the hippocampus compared
  to vehicle-treated controls. All data are expressed as mean percent change from
  saline-treated controls from each respective group + SEM, n = 7–9. See  for complete
  list of hippocampal cytokines measured. [*: Significant effect of PB treatment compared
  to vehicle treatment].'
