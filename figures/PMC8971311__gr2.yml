caption: 'Collagenolytic E. faecalis significantly alters gene expression in CT26
  cells. (A) Differentially expressed genes after E. faecalis was incubated with CT26
  cells for either 4 or 8 hours. (B) Gene set enrichment analysis using clusterProfile
  (p<.001) demonstrated that E. faecalis significantly influenced 4 cellular pathways:
  cofactor transport, regulation of microtubule cytoskeleton organization, collagen
  metabolic process, and integrin-mediated signaling pathway.'
