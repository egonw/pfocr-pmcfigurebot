caption: Regulation of FLT3 signaling pathway by YPN-005 in MOLM-13, OCI-AML2, and
  U937 cell lines. All cell lines were treated with increasing concentration of YPN-005
  for 24 h FLT3 and STAT5 mRNA (A) and protein (B) expression following YPN-005 treatment
  was measured.
article_title: Antileukemic activity of YPN-005, a CDK7 inhibitor, inducing apoptosis
  through c-MYC and FLT3 suppression in acute myeloid leukemia.
