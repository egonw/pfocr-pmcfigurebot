figure_title: AOS-SO4 inhibits osteosarcoma cell growth through the MEK1/ERK/mTOR
  pathway in vivo
caption: A Photograph of tumor-bearing mice and photograph of tumors after the mice
  were euthanized in the control group, AOS-SO4 group and AOS-SO4 + THBQ group. B
  Growth curve drawn by measuring tumor volumes on the indicated days. C Diagram showing
  the tumor weights in the subcutaneous tumor model. D Diagram showing the mouse weight
  in the subcutaneous tumor model. E, F Representative images of p-ERK and LC3B staining
  in the subcutaneous tumor model. G The quantification of IHC staining about the
  protein expression of p-ERK, LC3B, CDK6, and Casp9. H Protein levels of proliferation,
  apoptosis, autophagy, and phosphorylated ERK and mTOR in tumor tissues in the three
  groups. Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t-test. Error bars represent
  the SEM. *P < 0.05.

  induction by inactivating MEK1/ERK/mTOR signaling in a KSR1-dependent manner in
  osteosarcoma.
