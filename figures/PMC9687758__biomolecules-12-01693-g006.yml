caption: Genes and enrichment terms associated with extracellular signal molecules.
  Heatmap showing the genes with false discovery rate FDR < 0.05 for genes associated
  with growth factor activity and hippo signalling pathway. Heatmap colours correspond
  to fold change expressed as log2FC which has been limited to a range of [−4, 4]
  for clarity. The grey annotation bar on the left shows if the genome-wide false
  discovery rate is significant, FDR < 0.05 (in which FDR is the BH corrected p-value),
  for a particular gene which is the case for all genes considered here.
