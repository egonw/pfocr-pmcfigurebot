caption: Altered neurotransmitter precursor metabolism suggests suppressed ant immunity
  and increased dopamine during infection and manipulation. Upregulation of enzyme
  genes converting tyrosine to L-DOPA to dopamine coupled with reduced tyrosine and
  L-DOPA levels suggest increased concentrations of dopamine during infection, which
  may, in turn, contribute to manipulated behavior. Additionally, cardol triene may
  be produced by the fungus to suppress ant immunity by inhibiting melanin synthesis
  and thereby also increase availability of tyrosine and L-DOPA for dopamine synthesis.
  Combined with these specific metabolites, phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism
  pathway enrichments further implicate these processes in manipulated behavior. Increases
  in expression and abundance, are indicated by solid lines and red color, decreases
  by dotted lines and blue color. Metabolites are in rounded rectangles, genes are
  in rectangles. Annotated metabolites that were not DAMs have gray color, while compounds
  with white color were not identified in the LC–MS/MS data. Hypothesized links to
  ant (green) and fungal (orange) phenotypes are given in the shaded circles with
  connectors associating them with key metabolites. Black arrows are shown when useful
  for context to indicate that an enzymatic step had a corresponding enzyme gene in
  either the fungal or ant genome, but it was not a DEG.
