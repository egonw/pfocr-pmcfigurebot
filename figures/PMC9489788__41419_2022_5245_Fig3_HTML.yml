figure_title: Circ_0003215 supresses CRC cell proliferation, invasion and migration
caption: A Schematic illustration of three siRNAs was designed to target the back-splicing
  junction site of circ_0003215. B Knockdown efficiency of three siRNAs in SW480 and
  HT29 cells. Si2-circ_0003215 has the highest knockdown efficiency. C Schematic graph
  of the pLCDH-circ_0003215 plasmid constructs(left). The relative expression of circ_0003215
  or MYO9B was detected by RT-qPCR after treatment with empty vector or pLCDH-circ_0003215
  in CRC cells(right). D, E The cell proliferative effects of circ_0003215 were evaluated
  in SW480 and HT29 cells by CCK-8 and EdU assays. F Colony formation assay of SW480
  cells transfected with control, circ_0003215 siRNA, vector or pLCDH-circ_0003215.
  G The effect of circ_0003215 on the migration of SW480 cells was detected by wound
  healing assay. H, I The effect of circ_0003215 on the migration and invasion of
  CRC cells were evaluated by transwell assay. Graph shows mean ± SD; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001.
