caption: 'GnT-III reversed chemoresistance by reducing the drug efflux. Equal amounts
  of fluorescent dye were added to each cell line with the same cell numbers. After
  incubation for 1 h, the fluorescence intensities were assessed. A, a representative
  image of fluorochrome accumulation in cells was captured via confocal microscope.
  B, a fluorescence plate reader was used to quantitatively analyze the fluorescence
  intensities. The data are presented as the mean ± S.E.M (n = 3 in each group), one-way
  ANOVA; ∗∗∗p < 0.001. Scale bar: 10 μm. C and D, the K562/ADR and K562/ADR-GnT-III
  cells were cultured in the presence of doxorubicin and dasatinib at the indicated
  concentrations for 4 and 3 days, respectively, and then cell viabilities were measured
  via MTT assay. The inhibitory ratios for cell viabilities were normalized to that
  of each group without a drug (0 μM) and was set as 1. Data are reported as the mean ±
  S.E.M (n = 3), two-way ANOVA; ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001. ADR, adriamycin-resistant;
  GnT-III, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III.'
