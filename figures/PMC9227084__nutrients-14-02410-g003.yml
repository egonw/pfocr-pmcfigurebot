caption: 'Expression of differential metabolites and KEGG enrichment analysis between
  different groups. (A–C) Volcano plots of differential metabolites expression in
  the normal group vs. low-Se group, low-Se group vs. nano-Se supplement-1 group,
  and low-Se group vs. nano-Se supplement-2 group. (D–F) Top 20 rich factors of KEGG
  enrichment analysis results for metabolites differentially expressed in the normal
  group vs. low-Se group, low-Se group vs. nano-Se supplement-1 group, and low-Se
  group vs. nano-Se supplement-2 group. Se: selenium; KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of
  Genes and Genomes, VIP: variable importance for the projection.'
