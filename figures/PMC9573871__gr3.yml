caption: BAG3 is a direct downstream target of miR-135a-5p. (A) The subcellular localization
  of miR-135a-5p was detected by qRT-PCR in BC cells. (B) KEGG pathway analysis of
  the downstream target genes of miR-135a-5p. (C) GO enrichment analysis of the downstream
  target genes of miR-135a-5p. (D) The binding sequence of BAG3 mRNA 3′ UTR wild-type
  and mutant sequences with miR-135a-5p. (E) The effect of the miR-135a-5p overexpression
  on the luciferase activities of WT-BAG3 and MUT-BAG3 was verified by dual luciferase
  reporter gene assay. (F) Western blot was used to detect the effect of the overexpression
  or inhibition of miR-135a-5p on the expression of BAG3 protein. (G, H) The expression
  of BAG3 mRNA in the tumor tissues and normal tissues of 49 BC patients was detected
  by qRT-PCR. (I) Pearson's correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation
  between BAG3 mRNA expression and miR-135a-5p expression in BC tissues. *p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001.
