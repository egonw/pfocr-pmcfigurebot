caption: Validation of the METTL3/YTHDF1-RPN2-PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis in BLCA cells. (A,B)
  The effects of YTHDF1 and METTL3 on RPN2 mRNA and protein levels were verified after
  Dactinomycin and CHX treatment of T24 cells for 0 h, 2 h, 4 h and 8 h. (C) Prediction
  of m6A modification sites of RPN2 mRNA. (D) Cisplatin (0.5 μg/mL) was used to treat
  T24 cells for 0 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 96 h and 120 h later to verify the protein
  expression of METTL3, YTHDF1 and RPN2. (E) Single-gene Hallmark analysis found that
  both YTHDF1 and RPN2 were highly enriched in PI3K-AKT-MTOR SIGNALING. (F,G) Regulation
  of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway by METTL3 and YTHDF1. (H) Overexpression of RPN2 in
  T24 cells. (I,J) CCK-8 and EdU assays verified that increased expression of RPN2
  could rescue the effects of reduced METTL3 or YTHDF1 expression on T24 cell proliferation.
  (K) MTT assay verified that increased expression of RPN2 could rescue the effects
  of reduced METTL3 or YTHDF1 expression on cisplatin sensitivity of T24 cells. (L,M)
  Effect of overexpression of RPN2 on PI3K/AKT/mTOR when METTL3/YTHDF1 is lowly expressed.
  (N) Mechanistic sketch of the METTL3/YTHDF1-RPN2-PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis regulating BLCA
  cell proliferation and cisplatin sensitivity. ** p < 0.01, **** p < 0.0001.
