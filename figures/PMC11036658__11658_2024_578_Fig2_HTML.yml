caption: Induction of S phase and G2/M phase arrest by (+)-ABX in NSCLC cells. A Flow
  cytometric analysis of cell cycle distribution in A549 cells. B Flow cytometric
  analysis of cell cycle distribution in H1299 cells. C Flow cytometric analysis of
  cell cycle distribution in H226 cells. D–F Expression levels of G2/M phase-related
  proteins in the three NSCLC cell lines assessed through western blotting. Data are
  presented as means ± SD. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001 compared with
  the control group. The data were obtained from a minimum of three independent experiments
