caption: 'Functional analysis of the DEGs in HS and HS + BP treatments: (A) GO classification
  of the DEGs upregulated; (B) GO classification of the DEGs downregulated; (C) KEGG
  pathway enrichment results of the DEGs in HS vs. NT; (D) KEGG pathway enrichment
  results of the DEGs HS + BP vs. HS; The GO analysis was performed under Biological
  Process, Cellular Composition, and Molecular Functions categories; NT, normal temperature;
  HS, heat stress; HS + BP, dietary beet pulp under heat stress.'
