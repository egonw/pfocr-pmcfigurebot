caption: Interferons are thought to have both protective and detrimental effects in
  COVID-19 and in tuberculosis. a | COVID-19. Lung epithelial cells produce type I
  interferon and type III interferon upon infection with SARS-CoV-2. Both types of
  interferon contribute to the establishment of an antiviral state in infected and
  adjacent cells through the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Immunotherapeutic
  intervention early after infection includes treatment with interferons, in particular
  with type III interferon, to reduce virus replication. Later in infection, type
  I interferon drives sustained inflammation, and type III interferon may contribute
  to impaired tissue repair. Therefore, late treatment with interferons should be
  avoided. Instead, monoclonal antibody-mediated interferon blockade may be considered,
  and treatment with Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors may exert its beneficial effect
  partly through blocking the deleterious effects of interferons. b | In tuberculosis,
  type I interferon can promote disease by recruiting infection-permissive myeloid
  cells, by inhibiting intracellular control of bacterial growth in macrophages and
  by promoting immunopathology through necrosis of infected macrophages as well as
  neutrophils through the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETosis). By
  contrast, there is also evidence that type I interferon, under certain conditions,
  can enhance host resistance to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The basis of these divergent
  effects of type I interferon on M. tuberculosis is poorly understood. As yet, there
  have been no published clinical trials that directly target this pathway in tuberculosis.
