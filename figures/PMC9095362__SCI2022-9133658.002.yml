caption: CSC-Exos regulate angiogenesis in cancer. Exosomes derived from lung cancer
  cells carry miR-23a, which target ZO-1 and promote angiogenesis in cancer. Melanoma
  cell-derived exosomal miR-155-5p induces a proangiogenic switch of cancer-associated
  fibroblasts via the SOCS1/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Exosomes derived from bladder
  cancer (BC) cells carry CRK, which promotes the expression of ErbB2/3 in BC cells
  and induces vascular growth in BC. Exosomes derived from gastric cancer (GC) cells
  contain miR-130a, which induces activation of c-MYB-related angiogenic factors and
  thereby promotes vascular growth. Glioma cell-derived exosomes (GDEs) carry miR-9,
  which targets and inhibits COL18A1, THBS2, PTCH1, and PHD3 to promote angiogenesis.
  miR-26a carried by glioma stem cell-derived exosomes (GSCs-Exo) activates the PI3K/Akt
  pathway by targeting PTEN to promote angiogenesis in human brain microvascular endothelial
  cells (HBMECs).
