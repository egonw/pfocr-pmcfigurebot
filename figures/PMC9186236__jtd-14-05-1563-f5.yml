caption: 'SOST exacerbated the postinfarct pathological myocardial remodeling in vivo.
  (A,B) qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis to detect the expression of SOST in the
  SOST-overexpression group and the sh-SOST group, respectively. GAPDH was used as
  the internal control. (C,D) Echocardiographic measurements and histochemical staining
  analyses, including H&E, Masson, Sirius Red staining and CD31+ capillaries, to assess
  the effects of SOST on cardiac remodeling after MI in vivo (Bar =50 µm). Quantitative
  analysis of LVEDD, LVESD, LVEF, LVFS, myocyte size, fibrotic area, and CD31+ capillaries
  are shown in the right panel. The data are presented as mean ± SD. **P<0.01, SOST-overexpression
  group vs. model group; ##P<0.01, sh-SOST group vs. model group. SOST, sclerostin;
  sh, short hairpin; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; H&E, hematoxylin
  and eosin; LVEDD, left ventricular end diastolic dimension; LVESD, left ventricular
  end systolic dimension; LVEF, left ventricular ejection fraction; LVFS, left ventricular
  fractional shortening; qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction;
  SD, standard deviation.'
