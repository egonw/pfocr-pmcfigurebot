caption: KPILP is a glycoprotein containing N-glycosylation sites sensitive to PNGase
  F treatment. (A) Schematic representation of genetic construct encoding KPILP. Predicted
  N-glycosylation sites are designated with circles. 35S, Cauliflower mosaic virus
  (CaMV) 35S promoter; term, 35S terminator of transcription. (B) Western blot analysis
  of KPILP-enriched preparation isolated from the leaves of transgenic ΔXTFT or wild-type
  (WT) N. benthamiana plants agroinfiltrated with 35S-KPILP. Samples treated with
  PNGase F (+) or without treatment (-) are probed with antibodies against KPILP.
  The lower panels show the protein loading control stained with Amido black. Protein
  molecular weight markers are indicated. C (control), recombinant 6×His-KPILP protein
  produced in E. coli. (C) KPILP-enriched preparation isolated from the leaves of
  wild-type N. benthamiana plants producing KPILP mutant variants with abolished one
  of the N-glycosylation sites or all of three of them (3Nmut). Samples treated with
  PNGase F (+) or without treatment (-) are probed with antibodies against KPILP raised
  in rabbit and then with anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase.
  The lower panels show the protein loading control stained with Amido black. Protein
  molecular weight markers are indicated. C (control), recombinant 6×His-KPILP protein
  produced in E. coli. Green arrowhead indicates the position of the non-glycosylated
  KPILP, red circles – KPILP with one or several N-linked glycans.
