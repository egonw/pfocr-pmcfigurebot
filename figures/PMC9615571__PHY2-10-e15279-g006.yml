caption: (A, B) Effect of intermittent fasting, starvation, exercise and honey on
  serum isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) (a), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), glucose‐6‐phosphate
  dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (b) activities in naïve male
  Wistar rats. Bars represent mean ± S.E.M. (n = 6) (one‐way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni
  post hoc test). (A) *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 relative to controls. bp < 0.05
  relative to intermittent fasting group; cp < 0.05 relative to exercise group. dp < 0.05,
  ddp < 0.01, relative to honey group. (B) ****p < 0.0001 relative to controls. ap < 0.05,
  aap < 0.01, aaaap < 0.001 relative to diabetic group. bp < 0.05, bbp < 0.01 relative
  to intermittent fasting group; cp < 0.05, ccp < 0.01 relative to exercise group.
  dp < 0.05, ddp < 0.01, ddddp < 0.0001 relative to honey group
