caption: The difference in tumor immune microenvironment and EMT in two NET density
  group of surgical training set. (A) The immune cell infiltration in the TME were
  analyzed by mRNA expression. (B and C) Immunological characteristics of CD8+ T cells
  and Treg cells were compared in patients with low and high NET density. (D) Gene
  expression analysis revealed that high-NET density group had obvious enrichment
  of EMT signal pathway. (E) Immunohistochemical analysis of EMT associated protein
  in different NET density group (ns P>0.05, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01).
