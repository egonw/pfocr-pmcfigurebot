figure_title: Hippo signaling pathway is activated in lung tissues of COVID-19 and
  infected human lung in vitro cell cultures
caption: '(A) Transcriptome analysis of normal and COVID-19 autopsy lung samples (n
  = 5) is presented. Bar graph shows Log2FC (FC >1) of 45 Hippo signaling pathway
  genes that were differentially expressed in COVID-19 lung samples (p < 0.01). The
  adjacent heatmap depicts Z scores as expression levels of these 45 DEGs. Blue and
  red colors represent 12 down-regulated and 33 up-regulated genes, respectively.
  The KEGG pathway database was used to examine the Hippo signaling pathway genes
  in the differentially expressed gene list. Individual quantitative observations
  that underlie the data summarized can be located under the Supporting Information
  File as . (B) IHC of COVID-19 lung autopsy tissue shows high level of phospho-YAP
  Ser127 protein (dark brown). SARS-CoV-2 RNA (red) presence in COVID-19 lung was
  confirmed by RNA-FISH (RNAscope) (scale bar: 100 μm). (C) Western blot analyses
  of lung ALI cells show activation of Hippo-STAT1 pathways during SARS-CoV-2 infection
  (MOI 1). Density of bands compared to that of 2 dpi mock is provided for pYAP127
  and YAP. Proximal lung air interface cultures are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
  Antibody targeting Spike protein (green) was used for probing infection by immunohistochemistry.
  Cell-specific markers, such as Ac-tubulin (ciliated cells) and Mucin5 (mucus cells)
  were detected by antibody probes (red) to define infected cell types (6 dpi). Scale
  bar: 10 μm. (D) Human airway epithelial cells (Calu-3) were analyzed with IHC for
  pYAP127 and SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (red) in uninfected (Mock) and infected cells
  at 48 hours post-infection. Parental and Delta strains were used for infection studies
  (MOI 0.1). Scale bar: 50 μm. Insets highlight phospho-YAP S127 in infected cells,
  and white asterisks denote uninfected cells. Representative data from 3 independent
  studies are provided. ALI, air–liquid interface; COVID-19, Coronavirus Disease 2019;
  DEG, differentially expressed gene; IHC, immunohistochemistry; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes; MOI, multiplicity of infection; SARS-CoV-2, Severe Acute Respiratory
  Syndrome Coronavirus 2.'
