caption: GATA5 participates in PCa progression through regulating PLAGL2 via the FAK/PI3K/AKT
  pathway. (A,B) A wound-healing experiment was utilized to explore the ability of
  migration in the four groups. (C,D) Transwell invasion assays demonstrated that
  knockdown of PLAGL2 in the pc-GATA5 group further reduced the number of cells that
  went through the chamber. (E) PLAGL2 knockdown enhanced the function of GATA5 overexpression
  in hindering the protein level of p-FAK, p-PI3K, as well as p-AKT. (F) GATA5 affected
  cell apoptosis and EMT by regulating PLAGL2. Data are presented as mean Â± SD of
  at least three experiments. * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01.
