caption: The association of TSG genotypes with TF activity and pathway patterns. (A)
  Heatmap showing mean sample-specific TF activity and pathway enrichment scores that
  are significantly associated with TSG genotype groups based on the one-way ANOVA
  analysis (FDR < 0.05). (B) Boxplots indicate the distribution of inferred IRF3,
  and BCL6 TF activities and interferon-alpha response, E2F targets and epithelial
  to mesenchymal transition enrichment score (ES) based on gene expression profiles
  across tumor TSG genotypes. Samples with different letters exhibit statistically
  significant TF activity or pathway enrichment GSVA score (one-way ANOVA, Tukeyâ€™s
  HSD, p < 0.1). (C) The top heat map shows tumors clustered by the inferred IRF family
  TF activities. The middle panel shows the pathway ES for interferon pathways for
  each tumor based on clustering by TF activities. The bottom panel shows the mRNA
  expression profile for each tumor for genes highly correlated with IRF TF activity
  (absolute value of Pearson correlation > 0.75). The data with different little letters
  show significant difference.
