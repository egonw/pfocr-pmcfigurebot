caption: 'EPBS–induced cell death through ROS production. (A–C) HCCLM3 cells were
  treated with EPBS for 24 h and fixed EtOH. Cell cycle analysis, Annexin/PI staining
  analysis, and TUNEL assay were performed. *** p < 0.001 vs. non-treated (NT) cells.
  (D) HCCLM3 cells were treated with EPBS for 12 h, and the treated cells were reacted
  with H2DCFH-DA for 30 min at 37 °C. *** p < 0.001 vs. non-treated (NT) cells. (E)
  The cells were incubated with EPBS (50 µM) for 24 h and GSH/GSSG assay was conducted
  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Luminescence was measured using luminescence
  readers. *** p < 0.001 vs. non–treated (NT) cells. (F,G) The cells were treated
  with 50 µM of EPBS or 3 mM of NAC for 6 h. (H,I) HCCLM3 cells were treated with
  EPBS or NAC (3 mM) for 24 h. Thereafter, Western blotting and Annexin/PI staining
  analysis were performed. *** p < 0.001 and ** p < 0.01 vs. EPBS–treated cells. Abbreviations:
  Euphorbiasteroid (EPBS); glutathione (GSH); N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC); signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3).'
