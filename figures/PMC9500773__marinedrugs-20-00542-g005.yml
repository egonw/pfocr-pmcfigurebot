caption: Metastasis-related protein profiles in PCa cells treated with fucoidan and
  the related proposed signaling pathway. (A) Modulation of protein abundance in DU/DX50
  cells was determined using MWA and different antibodies. Representative MWA images
  and their results via heatmap are shown. (B) Schematic diagram showing the inhibition
  of the expression of IL-1R in the membrane and IKKÎ± in the cytoplasm, leading to
  the expression of the precursor form of NF-kB (p105) and a decrease in the active
  form of NF-kB (p50), resulting in a decrease in Cox2 expression and a reduction
  in metastasis of PCa cells.
