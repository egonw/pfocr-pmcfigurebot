caption: Schematic representation of the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway regulated by
  SIRT4 in MGCs. Under normal conditions, SIRT4 depletion in MGCs inhibits ATP generation
  in mitochondria, which impinges on p-AMPK modulation, thus activating mTOR-mediated
  autophagy. Under oxidative stress, dysfunctional autophagy can induce disturbed
  mitochondrial dynamics by increasing mitochondrial fission and decreasing fusion,
  leading to MGC apoptosis.
