figure_title: Loss-of-function of STEAP2 inhibits the proliferation and migration
  of PTC cells
caption: 'A-B The knockdown effect on STEAP2 was detected by RT-qPCR and western blot
  after transfection of K1 and KTC-1 cells with designed siRNAs targeting STEAP2 (si-STEAP2)
  or negative control (si-NC). C–E CCK-8 assay, colony formation assay, and EdU assay
  were used to determine the viability of BCPAP and TPC-1 cells after STEAP2 silencing.
  Scale bar: 50 μm. F–H Wound healing assay, transwell migration assay, and transwell
  invasion assay were performed to evaluate the migration ability of K1 and KTC-1
  cells after STEAP2 activation. All data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation
  of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001.'

  thyroid cancer progress by blocking the Hedgehog signaling pathway and epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition.
