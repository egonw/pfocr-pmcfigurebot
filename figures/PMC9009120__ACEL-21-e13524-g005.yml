caption: 'Significantly enriched signaling pathways across all aging hallmark protein
  lists. (a) p‐values of enriched signaling pathways across all aging hallmarks. We
  identified the genes linked to each of the top 30 ARDs associated with an aging
  hallmark from text mining and took the union of genes. These were mapped to encoded
  proteins forming nine protein lists. The associated aging hallmark from text mining
  represents the column labels of the heatmap. We carried out GSEA and searched for
  GO terms related to signaling pathways. Five signaling pathways were significantly
  enriched across all aging hallmark protein lists. (b‐f) The union of proteins/ genes
  associated with each of the five significantly enriched pathways was derived and
  they were linked to their associated ARDs. These are shown in the circos plots representing:
  (b) IFN‐γ‐mediated signaling pathway, (c) T‐cell receptor signaling pathway, (d)
  positive regulation of T‐cell receptor signaling pathway, (e) positive regulation
  of the ERK1/2 cascade, and (f) the intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway in response
  to DNA damage by p53 class mediator. Abbreviations: Table'
