caption: RR plays a vital role in alleviating against OVX-induced bone loss in vivo.
  (a) Representative image of experimental mouse operation processing mode. (b) Weight
  change diagram of C57BL/6J mice before and after OVX surgery. (c) Mice forelimb
  bone tissue was isolated of from each experimental group. Adding tissue lysate to
  extract tissue protein, MCU-specific primary antibody was used to show the results
  by western blot. (d) Quantitative analysis of protein expression, normalized to
  β-actin. (e) Tissue total RNA was extracted from mice forelimb, and the mRNA expression
  levels of CTSK and ATP6v0d2 were displayed by qPCR. (f) Immunofluorescence staining
  to detect the expression of the MCU, scale bar = 500 μm. (g) Representative micro-CT
  images of 3D demonstrating that OVX-induced osteoporosis was prevented by RR treatment.
  (h) H&E staining results detect bone mass loss, scale bar = 100 μm. (i) Immunohistochemical
  staining shows MCU expression and distribution, scale bar = 50 μm. (j) Representative
  image of TRAP staining and the TRAP positive osteoclast numbers per field of every
  specimen were examined, scale bar = 20 μm. (k) The von Kossa staining of femurs
  was used for the measurement of MS/BS (%), scale bar = 100 μm. (l) Calcein double
  fluorescent labeling to detect the femur mineral apposition rate (MAR) in mice,
  scale bar = 20 μm. Data was presented as means ± SEM; n = 3; ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.
