caption: Influence of BJe on cell cycle distribution of THP-1 cells. Progression of
  THP-1 cells through the cell cycle phases was assessed by cytofluorimetric analysis
  after exposure to BJe (1–5 mg/mL) for 24, 48 and 72 h. Representative plots of three
  different experimental sessions of PI staining performed in triplicate (n = 9) are
  shown (on the left), along with the coefficient of variation (CV) value. Histograms
  report the percentage of cells present in sub G0 (white bar), G0/G1 (green bar),
  S (dark yellow bar), and G2/M (cyan bar) phases, expressed as the mean ± SEM of
  three independent experiments performed in triplicate (n = 9) (on the right).
