caption: Western blotting for the analysis of mitochondria-associated protein expression
  after 13-acetoxysarcocrassolide treatment. HA22T and HepG2 cells were treated with
  different concentrations of 13-acetoxysarcocrassolide (1, 2, and 4 µM) for 24 h
  and analysed by western blotting. The results showed changes in cytochrome C, Bax,
  Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, Bad, and p-Bad. β-Actin was used as the internal protein loading
  control.

  carcinoma cells through mitochondrial dysfunction and suppression of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/p70S6K
  signalling pathway.
