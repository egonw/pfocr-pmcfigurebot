figure_title: Reciprocity between HMGB1 and SIRT3 was involved in the neuroprotective
  effects of TLB on cognitive impairment of AD
caption: 'a Reciprocity of HMGB1 between SIRT3. a1 The substrate binding sites. a2
  The substrate binding surface. a3 Interactions of HMGB1 with active amino acid sites
  and Pi of SIRT3. The HMGB1 protein was shown in red color solid ribbon, while SIRT3
  protein was shown in blue. b binding affinity of HMGB1 with SIRT3 was detected by
  SPR assay. c, d Co-IP analysis indicated that a reduction in HMGB1 acetylation following
  treatment of TLB after Aβ25-35 insults (n = 5). e, f TLB induced direct interactions
  between HMGB1 and SIRT3 (n = 5). g SIRT3-KO BV2 cells were generated using lentivirus-based
  CRISPR/Cas9 system (n = 6). Treatment with or without 50 μM TLB for 48 h after Aβ25-35
  insults in WT and SIRT3-KO BV2 cells. h HMGB1 level (n = 6). i NF-κBp65 binding
  activity determined at OD 450 nm (n = 6). The data were presented as the mean ± SEM.
