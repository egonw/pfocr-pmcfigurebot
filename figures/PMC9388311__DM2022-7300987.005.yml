caption: Effects of different concentrations of IL-8 on autophagy-related PI3K/Akt
  signal path in GC SGC7901 cells. (a) Western blot was used to detect the effects
  of different concentrations of IL-8 on autophagy-related PI3K/Akt signaling pathway
  in GASTRIC cancer SGC7901 cells. (b) Histogram of p-PI3K protein expression. (c)
  Histogram of PI3K protein expression. (d) Histogram of p-Akt protein expression.
  (e) Histogram of Akt protein expression. ∗P < 0.05 in contrast to the controls,
  ∗∗P < 0.001 in contrast to the controls.
