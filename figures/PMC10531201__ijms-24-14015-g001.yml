caption: Schematic representation of the sphingolipid metabolic pathway. The de novo
  sphingolipid synthesis occurs in the ER, Golgi, plasma membrane, whereas the catabolic
  pathway (also called the salvage pathway) occurs in the acidic organelles (lysosomes
  and late endosomes). The enzymatic metabolism of sphingolipids occurs within a compartmentalized
  and interconnected network, and intersects with other metabolic pathways such as
  the CoA, fatty acyl, amino acid, carbohydrate, and nucleotide metabolic pathways
  (cellular location reviewed in, e.g., [,]).
