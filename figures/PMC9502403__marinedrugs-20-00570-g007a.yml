caption: Saq B1 affects the expression of EMT-related proteins and mRNA. (A) SW480
  and SW620 cells were treated with 0–0.3 μmol/L Saq B1, then the protein expression
  of NF-κB, Twist, Slug, and Snail was measured by Western blot. (B) Western blot
  analysis was used to analyze the levels of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin.
  (C,D) RT-PCR results showed that N-cadherin and vimentin mRNA expression was downregulated
  and that the mRNA expression of E-cadherin was upregulated after Saq B1 treatment
  compared with the GAPDH expression level. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
