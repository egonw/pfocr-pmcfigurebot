caption: Protective effect of Dex on oxidative stress-induced cell death in PC12 cells.
  PC12 cells were stimulated with conditioned medium from BV2 cells treated with LPS
  and ATP or Dex. Representative image of (A) intracellular ROS detection after a
  16 h incubation period with conditioned medium and (B) cell death detection after
  24 h incubation with conditioned medium. Scale bar = 50 Î¼m.
