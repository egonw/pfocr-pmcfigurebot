caption: 'Knock-down of RUVBL1 by siRNA attenuated growth and metastasis of the OSCC
  cell line, H157, by inhibiting β-catenin signaling. (a) Knock-down of RUVBL1 by
  siRNA suppressed H157 cell proliferation as indicated using the colony formation
  assay. The box plot showed the number of cells. (b) Knock-down of RUVBL1 by siRNA
  inhibited migration of the H157 cells in the wound healing assay. Significant differences
  between groups were assessed using a Student''s T test and shown by ∗ and #, p <
  0.05. (c). After transfection of the H157 cells with RUVBL1 siRNA or scramble siRNA
  (siNC), cell invasive ability was determined by cell invasion assay. All experiments
  were performed in triplicate. Significant differences between groups were assessed
  using a Student''s T test and shown by ∗ and #, p < 0.05. (d) Expression of β-catenin
  pathway proteins was detected by western blot analysis. Intensity of the gray band
  was calculated by ImageJ and shown in the figure.'
