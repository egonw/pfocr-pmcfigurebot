caption: Fas apoptotic pathway.Fas apoptotic pathway. Normally, as part of the downregulation
  of the immune response, activated B and T lymphocytes upregulate FAS and activated
  T lymphocytes upregulate FAS-ligand. These lymphocytes interact and trigger the
  caspase cascade, leading to proteolysis, DNA degradation, and apoptosis. This FAS-mediated
  pathway is part of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. In contrast, mitochondrial-induced
  apoptosis after cellular stress is part of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Patients
  with ALPS have a defect in the FAS apoptotic pathway, leading to abnormal lymphocyte
  survival.Reproduced with permission Â© Sue Seif.
