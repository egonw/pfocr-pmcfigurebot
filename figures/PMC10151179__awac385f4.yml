caption: RF models (increase in prediction error). In the normal cognition groups
  (HC and SCD), MD in the external capsule pathway was important in predicting scores
  in attention tests, while NBM volume and WM hypointensities received low importance
  scores in all models. In the impaired cognition groups (MCI and Alzheimer’s disease
  dementia), NBM volume and MD in external capsule and cingulum pathways were important
  in predicting scores in most memory and attention tests. ExCap = external capsule
  pathway; Cing = cingulum pathway; Rem WM = WM excluding cholinergic pathways; NBM/TIV
  = volume of NBM scaled by TIV; Var = variance; yrs = years. IncMSE = conditional
  variable importance computed by increase in the mean square error of prediction.
  This IncMSE is the result of a corresponding variable being permuted within a grid
  defined by the covariates that are associated to the variable of interest.
