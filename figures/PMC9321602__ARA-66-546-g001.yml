caption: 'DSB repair pathways. Choice of the pathway is initially determined by 53BP1
  and BRCA1, with 53BP1 promoting NHEJ and BRCA1 stimulating HR. NHEJ begins with
  Ku70‐Ku80 heterodimer binding to the broken DNA ends, followed by trimming via endonuclease
  Artemis and final ligation step via the LIG4‐XRCC4‐XLF‐PAXX complex. In MMEJ (sometimes
  also known as aEJ or TMEJ), PARP1 promotes DNA end synapsis and POLθ recruitment.
  After annealing of the microhomologous sequences (2–20 base pairs), the XPF/ERCC1
  complex removes the redundant 3′ flaps. Subsequent ligation is mediated by LIG3/XRCC1.
  HR is initiated by DSB sensing by the MRN complex. Facilitated by BRCA1 and CtIP,
  MRN performs a short‐range resection, followed by a more extensive resection by
  EXO1 and/or BLM with DNA2 nuclease with subsequent coating of the 3’ ssDNA overhangs
  by RPA. BRCA1‐PALB2‐BRCA2 complex promotes RAD51 filament assembly. At this point,
  the DNA can be extended in a template‐dependent manner via SDSA, which results in
  a non‐crossover gene conversion. Alternatively, the formation of the double Holliday
  junction can resolve either as a crossover or as a non‐crossover. In contrast to
  MMEJ, SSA requires long regions of homology (20–25 base pairs) between the resected
  DNA ends. Annealing of the complementary ssDNA is mediated by RAD52, while non‐homologous
  flaps are digested by the XPF/ERCC1 complex. DSB, double‐strand break; 53BP1, p53
