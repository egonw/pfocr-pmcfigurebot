caption: T cell response pattern during COVID-19 infection. (A) Moderate COVID-19
  patients have a gene overlap in T cell subgroups (H_L_Group, L_H_Group, H_Group,
  and L_Group). (B) Severe COVID-19 patients have a gene overlap in T cell subgroups
  (H_L_Group, L_H_Group, H_Group, and L_Group). (C) Summarize the impact on the H_L_Group
  and L_H_Group subgroups in the process of COVID-19 infection. (D) In T cell subgroups,
  moderate patients (M) were compared with healthy controls (H). H_L_Group specific
  genes, L_H_Group specific genes, and genes common to all T cell subgroups (Common_Group)
  KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, node size represents the number of genes, and
  color intensity represents -log10 q-value. (E) In T cell subgroups, severe patients
  (S) were compared with moderate patients (M). H_L_Group specific genes, L_H_Group
  specific genes, and genes common to all T cell subgroups (Common_Group) KEGG pathway
  enrichment analysis, node size represents the number of genes, and color intensity
  represents -log10 q-value.
