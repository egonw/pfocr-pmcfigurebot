caption: 'Two-dimensional center of pressure and center of mass trajectories during
  gait initiation. Example of the pathway of the center of pressure (CoP, grey solid
  line) and center of mass (CoM, black dotted line) during a gait initiation trial
  of one healthy subject (left panel) and one Parkinsonian patient without (PDNF,
  central panel) and one patient with (PDF, right panel) a positive history of freezing
  of gait. We defined the imbalance (IMB) phase as the interval between the onset
  of the APAs (APAONSET) and the heel-off of the swing foot (HOSW), and the unloading
  phase (UNL) as the interval between the HOSW and the toe-off of the swing foot (TOSW).
  The black dashed line represents the CoP–CoM vector at the end of the unloading
  (UNL) phase. With respect to healthy controls, the CoP displacement during the IMB
  phase was reduced for both PD and PDF patients. The CoP displacement during the
  UNL phase was in most cases backwards for the PDF patients only. Please see  for
  further details. Abbreviations: APAs, anticipatory postural adjustments; AP, anterior–posterior;
  CoP, center of pressure; HC, healthy controls; HO, heel off; ML, mediolateral; PDF,
  Parkinson’s disease with freezing of gait; PDNF, Parkinson’s disease with no freezing
  of gait; TO, toe-off.'
