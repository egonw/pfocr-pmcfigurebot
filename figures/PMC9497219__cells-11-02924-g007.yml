caption: Different gene expression signatures in different eMPM molecular subtypes
  are shown by GSEA. (A) Different gene expression patterns in subtype I and subtype
  II are represented. Genes that are overexpressed are red, while genes that are under-expressed
  are blue. (B) In subtype I, GSEA demonstrates the activity of the ECM receptor interaction
  and WP gastric cancer network. (C) In subtype II, GSEA revealed the activation of
  the fatty acid metabolism pathway and cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins pathways.
