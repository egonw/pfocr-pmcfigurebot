caption: (a) Task sequence. Each trial started with a fixation cross-displayed for
  500 ms followed by a dot motion stimulus displayed for 400 ms, presented on the
  right side of the cross. Participants were requested to press a response key immediately
  after the offset of the stimulus, by selecting the coherent motion perceived (e.g.,
  leftward or rightward) and subsequently to report their confidence by pressing the
  respective numeric keys (e.g., 1,2,3,4). No time out was present for both responses.
  (b) Stimuli. The motion coherence of the stimulus varied across trials (ranging
  from 0% up to 80%, across 10 levels); here a schematic representation of a stimulus
  with 8% of dots moving rightward. (c) Experiment timeline. For each participant,
  the experiment began with a training session of 2 blocks, performed to allow the
  participant to reach a stable performance level before the actual experiment. This
  preliminary phase was followed by a BSL session. After the BSL measurement, participants
  were randomly assigned to one of 2 ccPAS conditions. Participants had to perform
  the same task immediately (T0), and 30 (T30) minutes following the ccPAS protocol.
  One session consisted of three blocks of 200 trials each. (d) ccPAS protocols. The
  stimulation lasted 15 minutes and consisted of 90 paired pulses at fixed intensity
  (60% of TMS max output). The parameters and cortical target varied relative to the
  pathway involved. In particular, the IPI between stimulated areas was set to 20
  ms for ExpV5-V1, 30 ms for ExpIPS-V1, and 0 ms for CtrlIPS-V1. BSL, baseline; ccPAS,
  corticocortical paired associative stimulation; IPI, interpulse interval; TMS, transcranial
  magnetic stimulation.
