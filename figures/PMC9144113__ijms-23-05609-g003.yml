caption: 'Perinatal obesity inhibits hepatic insulin/IGF-1 signaling. (A) IGF-1 protein
  expression in proteomic analysis at P21. (B) Measurement of genes encoding for IGF-1
  (Igf1), IGF-1 receptor (Igf1r), insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins 1–3
  (Igfbp1-3), insulin receptor (Insr), insulin receptor substrate (Irs1), and growth
  hormone receptor (Ghr) using quantitative real-time PCR (n = 10 per group). (C,D)
  Assessment of insulin receptor (INSR; C) and IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R; D) protein
  abundance in liver homogenates using immunoblots. (E-G) Assessment of insulin/IGF-1
  signaling pathway using immunoblot: phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) and total AKT protein
  expression (E); phosphorylated P38 (pP38) and total P38 MAP kinase protein expression
  (F); and phosphorylated FoxO1 protein abundance (G). β-Actin served as loading control;
  pAKT and pP38 were related to total AKT and total P38, respectively; pFoxO1 was
  related to β-Actin. Densitometric analyses are displayed below the respective immunoblots.
  Immunoblots: SD group (n = 5), HFD group (n = 5). Data are presented as mean ± SEM;
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01. FoxO1, Forkhead-Box-O-1 transcription factor; HFD, high-fat
  diet; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor 1; Igfbp, insulin-like growth factor-binding
  protein; Igfr, insulin-like growth factor receptor, Insr, insulin receptor; Irs1,
  insulin-receptor substrate 1; p, phosphorylated; P38, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) p38; SD, standard diet.'
