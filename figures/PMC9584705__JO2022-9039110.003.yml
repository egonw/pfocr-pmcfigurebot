caption: 'The cellular and subcellular localization of RBP7 in breast cancer. (a–b)
  The cellular localization of RBP7 mRNA in single breast cancer cells. The expression
  level is colored by marker intensity. UMAP: uniform manifold approximation and projection.
  (c) Heatmap showing the mRNA expression of RBP7 in different cell types. (d–g) Representative
  immunohistochemical staining of normal tissues (https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000162444-RBP7/tissue/breast)
  (d) and breast cancer with weak (e), moderate (f), or strong (g) RBP7 expression
  (https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000162444-RBP7/pathology/breast+cancer). Scale
  bars with lengths of 200 μm or 20 μm are displayed in the left and right panels,
  respectively.'
