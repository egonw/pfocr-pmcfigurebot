caption: 'Effects of Takr-h1 silencing on expression levels of JH signalling-related
  genes. The relative expression levels are expressed as the mean ± s.e.m. The green
  column represents the control group that was fed dsEGFP, while the pink column represents
  the treatment group that was fed dskr-h1. Asterisks represent significance levels:
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01; n.s. indicates no significance p > 0.05.'
