caption: 'Functional exploration of the TWAS-identified genes associated with hypertension.
  A: Venn diagram revealed overlapping TWAS-significant genes in different tissues.
  Red, left heart ventricle; blue, aorta; orange, whole blood; green, peripheral blood.
  B: Network plot of enriched KEGG and GO terms for the TWAS-significant genes. Counts:
  the number of genes involved in the corresponding signaling pathway. (Red represents
  pathways, and blue represents genes.)'
