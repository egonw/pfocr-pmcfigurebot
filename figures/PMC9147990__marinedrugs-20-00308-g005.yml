caption: 'PWG inhibits AP-1 expression in UVB-irradiated HDFs. HDFs were irradiated
  with UVB (20 mJ/cm2), followed by treatment with 50, 100, and 200 µg/mL of PWG.
  Protein expressions of c-Fos (B), c-Jun, p-c-Jun (C) were determined by western
  blot (A). All data were indicated as mean ± SD of at least three independent experiments.
  ## p < 0.01 versus normal.'
