caption: PI3K/AKT pathway activity in melanoma cell lines. A Normalized expression
  (z-score) from genes (n = 49) corresponding to the MEK-dependent transcriptional
  signature [] in MaMel cell lines. B Representative Western blot analysis of AKT
  and S6 phosphorylation in MaMel cell lines. The phosphorylated (p-) and total proteins
  are shown; GAPDH served as loading control. C Densitometric analysis of Western
  blots showing the relative intensity from p-AKT and p-S6 to total AKT and S6, respectively.
  Data from three independent experiments are shown (n = 3). D Heatmap displaying
  the scaled expression (z-score) of signature genes from MAPK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, and
  TGF-β pathways in 53 melanoma cell lines from Tsoi et al. [], with different NRAS/BRAF
  mutation status and degrees of differentiation. The top annotations show the level
  of enrichment (ES) of the signatures in every cell line. E Enrichment of signatures
  from the MAPK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, and TGF-β pathways for the distinct differentiation
  subtypes within the aforementioned panel of melanoma cell lines
article_title: PI3K/AKT signaling allows for MAPK/ERK pathway independency mediating
  dedifferentiation-driven treatment resistance in melanoma.
