caption: Cartoon illustration of the pathway framework of GRNs adapted from [,]. Under
  our four simplified assumptions, a GRN (genotype) consists of a fixed number of
  proteins as nodes and a constant number of directed edges depicting the activator/product
  pairs of genes. The phenotype is modeled as the Boolean states of proteins (colored),
  which are determined by their reachability from the external stimulus (lightning
  icon).
