caption: RGS2 does not affect Gαq-mediated YAP activation in uveal melanoma cells.A,
  schematic describing the signaling pathway leading to YAP activation downstream
  of Gαq. Representative images (B) and quantification (C) of three independent experiments
  demonstrating effects of Gαq siRNA and Dox-induced RGS2 expression on nuclear localization
  of YAP/TAZ. Gαq siRNA results in almost a 50% reduction in YAP/TAZ nuclear localization.
  Induction of RGS2 protein expression has no effect on YAP/TAZ nuclear localization.
  YAP/TAZ activation was measured using a lentiviral TEAD luciferase reporter in 92.1
  (D) and Mel-202 (E) cells. In both cell lines, Gαq siRNA results in a significant
  (∼75%) reduction in TEAD luciferase activity. Induction of RGS2-HA has no effect
  on TEAD luciferase. Results of three independent experiments in both 92.1 and Mel-202 cells.
  ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001 using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test for pairwise
  comparisons. Dox, doxycycline; RGS, regulator of G protein signaling; YAP, yes-associated
  protein 1.
