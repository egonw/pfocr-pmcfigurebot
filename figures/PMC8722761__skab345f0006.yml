caption: The inhibitory effect of LBP pretreatment on the NF-κB signaling pathway.
  (A) Immunofluorescence for detecting p65 activity. After fixation and permealization
  steps, cells were stained with antibody against subunit p65 of NF-κB (Cy3-labeled
  secondary antibody) and counterstained with DAPI (blue) for nuclear staining. (B,
  C) Immunoblotting and intensity from the respective blots represent for the phosphorylated
  p65 and phosphorylated IκBα. Cells were pretreated with or without LBP at doses
  of 100 or 300 μg/mL for 24 h, followed by the induction of 2 μg/mL LPS for 6 h.
  Results are expressed as means ± SEM. Letters in superscript indicate that the difference
  between groups was significant (P < 0.05).
