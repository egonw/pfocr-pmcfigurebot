figure_title: LSD1 expression is highly overexpressed in small cell lung cancer and
  inversely correlated with the expression of genes encoding the antigen presentation
  pathway
caption: (A) KDM1A mRNA expression was profiled in 29 unique cancer types; data from
  Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) (Broad, 2019) (Downloaded from cBioPortal).
  (B) KDM1A expression was queried in primary tumors previously analyzed in the SCLC-Atlas,
  consisting of LUAD (n=24) and SCLC (n=21) clinical samples. (C) KDM1A expression
  was profiled at the single-cell level from the SCLC-Atlas dataset, consisting of
  54,313 SCLC transcriptomes, 3341 LUAD transcriptomes and matched normal tissues.
  (D) Pearsonâ€™s correlations between LSD1 (KDM1A) expression and HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C,
  B2M, TAP1, TAP2, LMP-2 (PSMB8), LMP-7 (PSMB9) from SCLC-Global (downloaded from
  CellMiner). Values were calculated as RNAseq RPKM (log2(value+1)).
