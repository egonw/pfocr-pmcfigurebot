caption: 'Effect of a KG on glycolytic pathway in pancreatic tumors. A, GSEA was conducted
  on RNA-seq data obtained from pancreatic tumors of KG- and CG-treated KPC mice.
  The enrichment plot for the Glycolysis gene set upregulated by KG treatment (relative
  to CG) is depicted. Normalized enrichment score (NES) and nominal P value (P) were
  provided according to GSEA. B, Immunoblots of HK2 in pancreatic tumor homogenates
  isolated from CD-, KD-, CG-, and KG-treated KPC mice at endpoint. Loading control:
  β-actin. Bands were quantified and results are expressed as % control; *, P < 0.05.
  C, Immunoblots of HK2 in pancreatic tumor homogenates isolated from CG- and KG-treated
  KPC mice following 2 months of treatment. Loading control: β-actin. Bands were quantified
  and results are expressed as % control.'
