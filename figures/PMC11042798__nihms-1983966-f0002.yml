figure_title: Robinow syndrome and Robinow-like disorders arise from mutations in
  components of WNT5A-ROR signaling
caption: (A) Wnt5a knockout mouse embryos (E18.5, images from ()) exhibit body axis,
  limb, and tail truncations in addition to underdeveloped external genitalia and
  craniofacial malformations, compared to their wild-type littermates. These physical
  features are phenocopied in Ror2 knockout mouse embryos (B; E12.5 embryos derived
  from previously described Wnt5a () and Ror2 () mutant lines, photographed by S.
  Srinivasan. Scale bar = 1mm), as well as in RS patients (C; image from (), photographed
  by J. Lohr) and bulldogs (C; French bulldog).
