caption: 'The role of TP53 in the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway. RTKs are activated
  by hormones and growth factors, leading to the recruitment and phosphorylation of
  PI3K. PDK1 is then recruited to AKT at the PH domain. Cell cycle, survival, migration
  and apoptosis regulation occur as a result of AKT signalling pathway activation.
  AKT is also activated by mTORC2 and mTORC1 is activated by phosphorylated AKT, promoting
  protein translation and cell growth. Hdm2 regulates P53 in normal healthy cells,
  resulting in low levels. P53 regulates PTEN, inhibiting PI3K phosphorylation and
  AKT activation. AKT may enhance the function of Hdm2 and PTEN may prevent P53 degradation
  via AKT pathway inhibition. P53 binds to PI3K to inhibit PIK3CA and mutations in
  TP53 may result in PIK3CA hyperactivation and subsequent PI3K signalling pathway
  activation. AKT: Protein kinase B; PTEN: phosphatase and tensin homolog.'
