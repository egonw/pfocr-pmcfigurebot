caption: Notch/HIF interplay in early erythroid development. (a) The expression of
  Notch2 receptors in the cells harvested at the beginning (Day 3, D-3), Day 4 (D
  4) and Day 8 (D 8) of eight-day erythroid cultures. The curves represent the average
  percentage of receptor expression in whole culture. (b) The bars show average mean
  fluorescence intensity. Data are presented as mean values ± SD of 4 independent
  experiments. (c) The expression of Notch target gene HES1 was evaluated in erythroid
  cells obtained at Day 4 of culture of non-transduced CD34+ cells as well as transduced
  CD34+ cells with shHIF1α or with shHIF2α at 20 and 3% O2 by real-time polymerase
  chain reaction analysis. Bars represent relative gene expression with respect to
  native CB CD34+ cells. Data are shown as mean ± SD of five independent experiments.
  The asterisks indicate a significant difference with respect to NT condition at
  p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.001 (***), Mann–Whitney test. NT, non-transduced CD34+ cells;
  D, day of culture.
