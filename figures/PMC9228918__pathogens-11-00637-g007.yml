caption: E6 expressing cells depend on ATM/CHK2/BRCA1 axis for survival. HPV E6 induces
  p53 degradation avoiding cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Double strand breaks are
  processed by BRCA1 and other proteins warranting minimal genome stability. CHK2
  signaling reinforces E6 inhibitory effect on p53. Silencing or inhibition of ATM/CHK2/BRCA1
  shifts the balance inducing the accumulation of DNA lesions that reduce cell viability.
