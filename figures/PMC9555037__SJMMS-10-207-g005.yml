caption: 'PI3/AKT-mediated Nrf2 signaling enhanced by RGN. (a) pAKT and pPI3K proteins
  after carrying out western blot analysis. (b) The pAKT, Nrf2, HO-1, and cleaved
  caspase3 were traced by western blotting. Data was represented as the mean Â± SD
  of values (n = 3), and P < 0.05 represents key differences compared to DON alone.
  On the other hand, #P < 0.05 and RGN compared with the DON treatment groups'
