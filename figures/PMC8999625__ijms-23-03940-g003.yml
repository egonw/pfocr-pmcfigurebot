caption: 'Inhibitory effects of ABMA and DABMA on H1N1 life cycle and M2 channel molecular
  docking studies. (A) ABMA or DABMA treatment of MDCK cells at 15 µM and A/NY/61/LV16A
  (H1N1, MOI = 1) infection schemes in the time of addition assay. (B) Viral RNA was
  extracted from the cells at 12 hpi and quantified by qRT-PCR. (C) ABMA or DABMA
  treatment of MDCK cells at 15 µM and H1N1 (MOI = 1) infection schemes in the binding
  and entry assays. (D) Viral RNA was extracted from the cell cultures and quantified
  by qRT-PCR. Data represent mean ± SEM (n = 3). The experiments were repeated twice
  independently. Statistical significance was determined with one way ANOVA. Significance:
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 as compared to the virus control group. (E) Docking models
  of compounds in the M2 ion channel of IAV. Docking was performed using the crystal
  structure of the M2-amantadine complex with the PDB 6BKK access number. The −CDocker
  energies were calculated using Discovery Studio (Accelrys, San Diego, CA, USA).
  The top panel and bottom panel show the overall and top-view structures of the docking
  complexes, respectively. The middle panel shows the binding pocket from the side-view,
  in surface render mode without polypeptide chains B and C of M2. The major clashes
  of the side chains of the M2 polypeptide chains A and D are labeled by the amino
  acid residue types and their close inter-molecular distance with the compounds.'
