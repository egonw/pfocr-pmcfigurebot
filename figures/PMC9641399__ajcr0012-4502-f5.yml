caption: IVM inhibited the expressions of metastasis-related proteins in HCT-8 cells.
  (A and B) The expression of proteins in the cells treated with different concentrations
  of IVM for 48 h (A) or with 6 μM IVM for different times (B) were determined by
  Western blotting analysis. GAPDH was used as internal control. (C) The expression
  of β-catenin and epithelial cell markers ZO-1, occluding, and E-cadherin were detected
  in the cells by immunofluorescence analysis. Scale bars = 10 μm. Cells treated with
  vehicle served as control. The blots shown in (A and B) were representative of two
  independent experiments.
