figure_title: Phosphoproteomics identification of putative PP2A-B56 substrates in
  the context of HIV-1 infection
caption: (A) Heatmap of log2 fold changes for phosphorylation site groups that were
  differentially abundant in at least one comparison with no missing values.(B) Schematic
  of data filtering process to identify putative PP2A-B56 substrates with defined
  regulatory functions.(C) Heatmap of log2 fold changes for putative PP2A-B56 substrates.(D)
  Dot plot of validated PP2A-B56 substrates.(E) Table of regulatory functions annotated
  for putative PP2A-B56 substrates in the PhosphoSitePlus regulatory dataset.(F) Schematic
  of experimental and data analysis workflows for ARHG2 interaction analysis in the
  context of HIV-1 infection (n = 3 biological replicates).(G) Volcano plot of changes
  in ARHG2 IP-MS experiments. Protein group changes that were differentially increased
  and decreased are in red and blue, respectively. See also  and  and .
