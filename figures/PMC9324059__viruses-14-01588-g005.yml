caption: Key pathway network construction based on KEGG enrichment. (A) Gene–pathway
  of Houttuynia cordata against pneumonia. The node’s size is related to a degree;
  pink diamonds are signaling pathways, and blue circles are target genes. (B) Schematic
  diagram of key signaling pathways of Houttuynia cordata in treating pneumonia. Solid
  lines are direct actions, and dashed lines are indirect actions. Some intermediate
  molecules are not presented. Detailed information and key genes are listed in .
