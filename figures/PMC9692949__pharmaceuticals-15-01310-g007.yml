caption: 'TAX upregulated Nrf2/HO-1 signaling in the kidney of CIS-administered mice.
  (A) Photomicrographs of kidney sections stained with anti-Nrf2 antibody showing
  marked expression in control and TAX-treated mice, a noticeable decrease in CIS-administered
  mice, and increased expression in CIS-administered mice treated with 25 and 50 mg/kg
  TAX. (B) Image analysis showing significant increase in Nrf2 in CIS-administered
  mice treated with TAX. (C) TAX enhanced HO-1 activity in the kidney of CIS-administered
  mice. Data are mean ± SEM, (n = 6). *** p < 0.001 versus Control, ### p < 0.001
  versus CIS, and $$ p < 0.01 and $$$ p < 0.001 versus TAX (25 mg/kg).'
