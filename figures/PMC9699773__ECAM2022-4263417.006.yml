caption: 'Molecular mechanism diagram of the inhibitory effect of BWHD on EMs (by
  Figdraw). Note: the protein and mRNA expressions of autophagy-related genes Beclin-1
  were activated and p62 was downregulated in EMs models; BWHD may play the function
  of alleviating autophagy by inhibiting the TRL4/NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby
  reducing the autophagy level, to achieve the purpose of ameliorating the progress
  of EMs. These results proved that there was an inhibition effect of BWHD on autophagy
  in EMs by regulating TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway.'
