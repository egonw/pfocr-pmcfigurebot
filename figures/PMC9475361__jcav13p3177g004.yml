caption: 'LINC00674 activates the mTOR signaling pathway in HCC cells. (A) The lentivirus
  mediated shNRAs targeting LINC00674 (shLINC#1) and non-targeting shRNA (NTC) were
  transduced into Hep3B and MHCC97H cells. WB analysis was used to confirm the levels
  of p-mTOR, p-p70S6K and p-4E-BP1. (B) LINC00674 overexpressing HCC cells were treated
  with RAPA (10 ng/mL) for 48 h, a specific mTOR inhibitor. LINC00674-activated the
  mTOR signaling pathway was markedly abolished by RAPA treatment. (C) MTT, (D) EdU,
  and (E) transwell analyses demonstrated that RAPA treatment reversed the tumor-promoting
  role of LINC00674 in HCC cells. Scale bar: 50 Âµm for EdU assay. *P<0.05.'
