caption: Functional enrichment indicates that CSPP1 is potentially associated with
  ferroptosis and TME in LGG. (A) A volcano plot of CSPP1-related DEGs in LGG. Red
  and blue points indicated upregulated and downregulated genes, respectively. (B)
  A heatmap of correlation between CSPP1 and the top 20 DEGs. *** p < 0.001. (C) Bubble
  plots of GO enrichment. The X-axis represents the ratio of these DEGs, and the Y-axis
  represents the categories of DEGs. (D) Ridge plots of GSEA enrichment. p < 0.05
  was considered the meaningful pathway. Red and blue indicated immune-related pathways
  and ferroptosis-related metabolic pathways, respectively. (For interpretation of
  the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web
  version of this article.)
