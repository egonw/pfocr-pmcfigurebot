caption: KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the selected miRNAs. The heatmap shows
  the significantly enriched pathways (q-value < 0.05) of the selected miRNAs retrieved
  from the KEGG database in the DIANA-miRPath v3 web server (http://www.microrna.gr/miRPathv3,
  accessed on 13 September 2022). Hierarchical clustering of miRNAs was performed
  based on their similar pathway targeting patterns, and pathways were clustered together
  by related miRNAs. The color code represents the log (p-value (FDR)), with the most
  significant miRNA-pathway interactions in red. The table shows the top 10 most significant
  KEGG pathways and the related p-values (FDR), the number of genes involved in the
  pathway, and the number of miRNAs targeting the indicated pathways.
