figure_title: Combination of apatinib and ATF4 silencing contributed to cancer inhibition
  in vitro and in vivo
caption: A, B A549 and H460 cells were treated with or without siATF4 or apatinib,
  and flow cytometry was performed to detect apoptotic cells. C, D A549 and H460 cells
  were treated with or without siATF4 or apatinib, and a Cyto-ID detection assay was
  performed to evaluate the autophagy level. E Mouse xenograft tumors were established
  using shCon-H460 cells or shATF4-H460 cells. After treatment with apatinib or saline,
  the xenograft tumors were harvested and the images were photographed. F Tumor volumes
  were scaled every 3 days, and tumor growth curves were drawn. G Weights of the xenograft
  tumors. H, I Representative IHC images and analysis of positive percentage of Ki-67
  expression in xenograft tumors. Data are presented as mean ± SEM from three independent
  experiments.
