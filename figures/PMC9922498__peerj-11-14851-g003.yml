figure_title: Differential miRNAs and bioinformatics analysis
caption: (A) PCA plot of control (J) and model (M) rats. (B) Heatmap of differentially
  expressed miRNAs in the myocardial tissue of the infarct marginal zone. The color
  scale indicates the change in gene expression from relatively low (blue) to relatively
  high (red). (C) The intersection diagram of target genes of differentially expressed
  miRNAs. (D) GO analysis of target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs. The
  vertical axis represents GO function items. (E) KEGG signaling pathway analysis
  of target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs. The vertical axis represents
  the KEGG signaling pathway, and the horizontal axis represents the Gene Ratio, that
  is, the ratio of the number of genes in a KEGG pathway to the number of all the
  annotated genes in the KEGG pathway. The larger the proportion of genes, the higher
  the degree of enrichment.
