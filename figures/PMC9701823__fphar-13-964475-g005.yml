caption: 'OEA activated the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and downregulated the expression
  levels of apoptosis-related proteins. (A) The expression level of P85 in rat myocardium
  was detected by immunohistochemistry, scale = 50 μm. (B–G) WB was used to detect
  the expression levels of P85, p-Akt, Bax, Bcl-2 and cleaved caspase-3 proteins in
  myocardial tissues of rats in each group. Data were expressed as mean ± SEM, ***p
  < 0.001 vs. DM + S group; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001 vs. DM + I/R group.'
article_title: OEA alleviates apoptosis in diabetic rats with myocardial ischemia/reperfusion
