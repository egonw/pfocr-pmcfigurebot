caption: Viruses can block Pellino1 activity through different mechanisms. MsEPV encodes
  a Pellino protein that binds to IRAK but fails to engage downstream signaling. This
  prevents the production of type I IFNs and inflammatory cytokines. JEV enhances
  expression of the host miR-155, which in turn suppresses expression of Pellino1
  and inflammatory genes. Black X indicates that the Pellino1 protein is not synthesized.
  Red X indicates that the pathway cannot take place.
