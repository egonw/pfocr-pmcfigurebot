caption: 'Effect of FFA treatment for 24 h on oxidative stress in primary hepatocytes
  of laying hens. (A–D) Effect of FFA on intracellular ROS levels (A): inverted fluorescence
  microscopy; (B): Average fluorescence intensity of ROS; (C,D): flow cytometry. (E)
  Cellular superoxide dismutase activity in each experimental group. (F) Cellular
  malondialdehyde content in each experimental group. (G) Total antioxidant capacity
  of cells in each experimental group. Data are shown as the mean ± SD (n = 6), with
