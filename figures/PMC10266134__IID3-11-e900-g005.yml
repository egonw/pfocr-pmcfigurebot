  F(3,4) = 26.40, vs. LPS) and RhoA/GAPDH ratio (E) (F(2,3) = 63.44, F(3,4) = 48.58,
  vs. LPS) in different groups; Statistics for ROCK1/GAPDH ratio (F) and ROCK2/GAPDH
  ratio (G) (F(2,6) = 56.40, F(3,8) = 54.99, vs. LPS) in different groups. (**p < .01;
  ***p < .001). Immunofluorescent (IF) staining and flow cytometric (FCM) analysis
  in cells. IF staining for M1‐related biomarker (iba‐1 and iNOS) (H, K: FLPS = 2.333,
  vs. CON; FLPS+MEL = 27.14, vs. LPS) and M2‐related biomarkers (iba‐1 and Arg‐1)
