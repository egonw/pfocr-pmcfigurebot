caption: '(A) The catalytic cycle of P450 monooxygenase and the proposed mechanism
  of DFSM-activated peroxide-shunt pathway to generate the artificial P450BM3 peroxygenase.
  a: The peroxide-shunt pathway without the addition of the DFSMs; b: DFSM-activated
  peroxide-shunt pathway. (B) Typical reactions catalyzed by the DFSM-facilitated
  P450BM3-H2O2 system: 1. styrene epoxidation; 2. thioanisole sulfoxidation; 3 and
  4. hydroxylation of alkanes and aromatic compounds, 5. demethylation of aromatic
  ethers; 6. one-electron oxidation of phenol. (C) Co-crystal structure of P450BM3
  and the DFSM Im-C6-Phe (PDB No. 7EGN []). (D) Hydrogen bond networks between Im-C6-Phe
  and P450BM3. (E) Hydrophobic interactions between the anchor group of Im-C6-Phe
  and P450BM3. (F) Co-crystal structure-guided optimization of the DFSM by introducing
  hydrophobic unnatural amino acids.'
