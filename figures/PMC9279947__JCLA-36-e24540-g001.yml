caption: circ_0008726 inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of trophoblast
  cells (A) The viability of HTR‐8/SVneo cells was analyzed by CCK‐8 assay. (B) The
  migration of HTR‐8/SVneo cells was determined by wound healing test. (C) The invasion
  ability of HTR‐8/SVneo cells was analyzed by Transwell invasion. **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
