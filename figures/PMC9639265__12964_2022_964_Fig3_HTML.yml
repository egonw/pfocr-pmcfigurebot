caption: UPR Signaling in HER2+ BC. In HER2+ BC cells, HER2 amplification can activate
  the UPR through the PERK-ATF4-CHOP-TRAIL-R2 pathway, and the PERK-ATF4-ZEB1-E-cadherin
  pathway can regulate cell apoptosis and migration. Meanwhile, HER2-mTOR signaling
  can activate the IRE1 pathway. The drugs targeting ERS-associated signaling pathways
  in HER2+ BC are listed. Green represents pathway activators
