figure_title: The role of blockade of USP16 by lncEPAT in regulating senescence-like
  cell growth suppression and GBM tumorigenesis
caption: (A) GSC23 and GSC2 cells stably expressing USP16 were analyzed using neurosphere
  formation assays. Scale bar, 200 μm. (B) The proliferation of GSC23 and GSC2 cells
  expressing USP16 was analyzed by XTT assays. Relative cell viabilities were normalized
  to those at day 0 (means ± SEM of n = 3 independent experiments; *P < 0.01, two-tailed
  Student’s t test). (C) The cell lysates from different cells were analyzed by Western
  blot analysis using anti-USP16 antibody. (D) Stable GSC23 and GSC2 cells expressing
  two independent USP16 shRNAs were analyzed by Western blot analysis. (E and F) Stable
  GSC23 and GSC2 cells expressing lncEPAT shRNA2 or lncEPAT shRNA2 plus USP16 shRNA2
  were analyzed using neurosphere formation assays (E) and cell viability assays (F).
  Scale bar, 200 μm. Data are means ± SEM of n = 3 independent experiments; *P < 0.01,
  two-tailed Student’s t test. (G) Stable GSC23 and GSC2 cells (5 × 105 cells per
  mouse) expressing lncEPAT shRNA2 or lncEPAT shRNA2 plus USP16 shRNA2 were intracranially
  injected into nude mice. Tumor volumes were calculated (right panel; means ± SD
  of n = 8 mice for each group; *P < 0.01, one-way ANOVA test). (H) GSC23 tumor tissues
  were stained by SA-β-gal/eosin, p21, and Clusterin. Scale bar, 100 μm. The percentage
  of senescent cells was quantified (means ± SD of n = 6 random selected microscope
  fields; *P < 0.05, two-tailed Student’s t test). (I) Diagram showing the EGFR-lncEPAT-USP16
  regulatory cascades in gliomagenesis.
