figure_title: Semaphorin 5A promotes activation of SFs by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  signaling pathway
caption: A Significant KEGG pathway terms for differentially expressed genes. B Original
  image of the protein array analysis. C Total protein and phosphorylated protein
  levels for the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and its downstream molecules 4E-BP1
  and BAD in SFs detected by western blotting after treatment with Semaphorin 5A (1 μg/mL)
  at different times (n = 3). D Total protein and phosphorylated protein levels for
  the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and its downstream molecule 4E-BP1 in SFs detected
  by western blotting (n = 3). E mRNA levels of IL-6, IL-8, VEGF, and MMP-2 in SFs
  detected by qPCR after treatment with pictilisib (10 μM), MK-2206 (5 μM), temsirolimus
  (100 nM), and Semaphorin 5A (1 μg/mL) (n = 3). F Proliferation of SFs detected by
  a Cell Counting Kit-8 (n = 3–4). G Apoptosis of SFs detected by flow cytometry (n = 3).
  H Migration of SFs detected by wound healing assays (n = 3). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01;
  ***P < 0.001; ns not significant. Values of P < 0.05 were considered significant.
  SFs synovial fibroblasts.
