caption: Effects of RCE on TNF-α and IFN-γ induced NF-κB and STAT1 signaling pathway
  in HaCaT cells. The cells were pretreated with 50, 100, and 200 μg/mL RCE for 2
  h, followed by exposure to TNF-α and IFN-γ (10 ng/mL each) for 30 min. Cell extracts
  were prepared and NF-κB and STAT1 activation was analyzed by Western blotting using
  specific antibodies. (a) Results of Western blotting and protein levels of (b) phospho-IκB-α
  and IκB-α and (c) phosphor-STAT1. Equal protein loadings were confirmed by measuring
  phospho-IκB-α, IκB-α, STAT1, and β-actin expression. Protein levels were quantified
  using the Image Lab software (version 5.2.1). All data are presented as the mean
  ± S.D. of triplicate experiments. * p < 0.05 vs. TNF-α- and IFN-γ-stimulated cells.
