caption: 'Vitexin relieved ER stress to inactivate MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways
  in S. aureus-induced mastitis on mice. (a) The protein levels of PDI, BiP, Ero1-Lα,
  p-IRE1α, PERK, p-eIF2α, and CHOP in mammary gland tissues. (c) The expression levels
  of JNK, ERK, p38, and p65 proteins in mammary gland tissues. (b, d) Protein gray
  values were measured by the ImageJ software. Data was expressed as means ± SEM of
  three independent experiments. #p < 0.01 vs. the control group. ∗p < 0.05 vs. the
  S. aureus group; ∗∗p < 0.01 vs. the S. aureus group.'
