figure_title: RNA-seq analysis reveals downregulation of TGFb/BMP pathway genes in
  Mcm5 mutants
caption: '(A) Bland-Altman graph showing differences in the expression of every gene
  analyzed through RNA-seq from control and Mcm5 mutants in St16-AFT embryos. The
  expression of every gene is represented by a dot. Dots are located in the graph
  according to change in expression between conditions in a logarithmic scale, when
  compared with the media of the normalized expression. Genes with differences in
  expression between genotypes are represented in red, otherwise they are grey. Genes
  represented in positive values show higher expression in Mcm5 mutants than in controls
  and vice versa (graph made with DESeq2, statistical analysis performed by hypergeometric
  distribution adjusted by Benjamini-Hochberg; p-value < 0,05). (B) Fold change histogram
  of the relative expression in Mcm5 mutants compared to the control of representative
  genes involved in Tv4 specification, ap, eya, nab, sqz, dimm, dac, svp, and genes
  involved in BMP signaling pathway, gbb, Mad, sax and tkv. (C) Alignment distribution
  of reads obtained after RNA-seq analysis of tkv gene in control and Mcm5 mutants.
  The top of the graph shows the enrichment in sequences corresponding to every exonic
  region and the gene sequence of tkv gene represented in indigo (TopHat2) and blue
  (Flybase). A striking reduction in read coverage for the exons 1 and 2 (black arrows)
  of the tkv gene in Mcm5 mutants comparing to the control is shown. On the bottom,
  the graph shows the different isoforms of tkv RNAm represented in magenta, other
  genes located in the same chromosome region in green (its RNAm in yellow), and non-coding
  RNAs in orange (Flybase) (graph made with TopHat2, IGV). Genotypes: (A, B) w1118
  and Mcm5exc222/Mcm5exc222.'
