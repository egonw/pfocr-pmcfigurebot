caption: 'CRE analysis of the promoter region of DlCCD, DlSMXL, and DlD27 genes. (A)
  DlCCD, DlSMXL, and DlD27 family members were arranged in the order of phylogenetic
  tree. The names of CREs were marked on the bottom. The heatmap shows the number
  of main CREs corresponding to each member. (B) CREs were classified into four categories:
  stress response, growth and development, light response, and phytohormone response.
  The bar chart counts all the number of four types of CREs in each member, and different
  types of CREs are indicated by different colors. (C) Network diagram of predicted
  transcription factor binding sites with DlCCD, DlSMXL, and DlD27 family members.
  Gray connecting lines indicate the presence of interactions.'
