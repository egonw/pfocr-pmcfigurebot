caption: Relative expression of mRNA and the phosphorylation of protein (A) Expression
  of VEGFR2 in GC cells after they were transfected with negative control siRNA or
  VEGFR2 siRNAs (siVEGFR2-366, siVEGFR2-633 and siVEGFR2-990). (B) Expression of VEGF-A
  in GC cells cultured under a hypoxic condition. (C) Expression of Erk, P-Erk, Akt
  and P-Akt in GC cells after transfected with siRap1b or siVEGFR2 (left) Hypoxia
  (right) VEGF-A. (*P<0.05, **P<0.001).
