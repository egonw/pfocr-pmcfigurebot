caption: Identification of potential targets regulated in a similar manner to AGAP2(A)
  Workflow diagram used to identify genes whose expression could be regulated by the
  alternative selection of a TSSs, involving the presence of a G quadruplex (G4).
  First, the FANTOM database was used to identify all the transcripts that contained
  a G quadruplex (G4) consensus sequence between alternative TSSs within their defined
  TSS cluster. The G4 consensus sequences were identified using the pqsfinder package
  in R. The FANTOM database was also used to detect differential expression in PC
  (DU145, PC3) and CML (KU812, K562, KCL-22) cell lines for those genes that would
  encode a G4 consensus between alternative TSSs. Microarray and SWATH-MS data from
  the NCI-60 database were integrated to characterize genes that demonstrated discrepancies
  between their mRNA and protein levels (high mRNA and low protein) within those genes
  showing a differential 5′ UTRs with G4 sequences.(B) Metacore pathway enrichment
  analysis of mRNAs with alternative 5′ UTRs that contain G4 consensus sequences.
  The dot plot shows the top 15 enriched pathways with the largest gene ratio. The
  size of the dots represents the number of genes in each pathway and the color of
  the dots represents the adjusted p values (BH).(C) Venn diagram illustrating the
  overlapping genes in the FANTOM and NCI-60 databases showing differential 5′ UTRs
  with G4 consensus, with differentially expressed mRNA (≥1 log FC), and either no
  statistically significant differences in protein levels or significantly lower proteins
  levels in CML cell lines (left) or PC cell lines (right). The differential expression
  and TSS distribution were computed by linear modeling followed by empirical Bayes
  statistics.
