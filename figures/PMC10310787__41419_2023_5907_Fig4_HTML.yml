figure_title: SMYD3 deficiency and increased EMP1 mitigate Akt signaling in GC cells
caption: A KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of RNA-seq data (GSE214155) found that
  PI3K-Akt was the most influenced signaling pathway. B Immunoblotting analysis for
  H4K20me3 level, as well as EMP1, p-AKT(S473) and T-AKT in HGC-27 and SGC-7901 cells
  with SMYD3 deficiency. C Immunoblotting analysis for p-AKT(S473) level, as well
  as T-AKT in HGC-27 and SGC-7901 cells with exogenous expression of EMP1. D Immunoblotting
  analysis for H4K20me3 level, as well as EMP1, p-AKT(S473) and T-AKT in HGC-27 and
  SGC-7901 cells with SMYD3 deficiency combined with re-expression of SMYD3. E EMP1
  expression was decreased in GC tissues (N = 375) relative to normal ones (N = 32)
  (p < 0.05) in TCGA GC cohort. F EMP1 inhibits the cell growth in HGC-27 and SGC-7901
  cells by CCK-8 assay. G EMP1 suppresses the colony formation in HGC-27 and SGC-7901
  cells.
