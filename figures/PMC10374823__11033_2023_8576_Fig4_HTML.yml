caption: Cluster analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs in PC12 cells between
  the bilirubin and control groups. (a) Heatmap of differentially expressed mRNAs
  in the bilirubin group compared with the control group. (b) Scatter plots showing
  the mRNA data (fold changes ≥ 2 and P < 0.05). (c) GO analysis of the upregulated
  genes in the bilirubin group. (d) GO analysis of the downregulated genes in the
  bilirubin group. (e) KEGG pathway analyses of the upregulated genes in the bilirubin
  group. (f) KEGG pathway analysis of the downregulated genes in the bilirubin group
