caption: KCNH6 ameliorated hepatic glucose metabolism disorders in reversal KO mice.
  (a) Lentiviruses with GFP (LV-Ctrl) or Kcnh6 (LV-Kcnh6) were injected into 12-week-old
  male KO mice via the tail vein (7 × 104 TU/g body weight). (a) Restoration of KCNH6
  expression reversed the glucose metabolism disorder in KO mice (n = 14 for the WT
  group; n = 9 for the KO group). (b) mRNA levels of PEPCK and G6pase in the livers
  of mice detected by qRT-PCR (n = 3). (c) Levels of PEPCK and G6pase detected by
  western blotting (n = 3). (d) Fluo-4 AM staining for detecting changes in calcium
  ion levels in the cytoplasm of primary liver cells of KO mice (n = 6 for the WT
  group; n = 4 for the KO group). (e) Calcium ion levels of mitochondria in the KO
  mouse liver as detected by Rhod-2-AM staining (n = 4 for the WT group; n = 5 for
  the KO group). (f) Protein levels of the JNK signaling pathway as detected by western
  blotting (n = 3). (g) Western blotting was performed for measuring of the protein
  levels of genes related to the p38MAPK signaling pathway in the LV-Ctrl and LV-Kcnh6
  mice (n = 3). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. the LV-Ctrl group; n =
  6 mice in each group. Statistical comparisons were calculated using the (b–g) Mann–Whitney
  U test and (a) unpaired-sample t-test.
