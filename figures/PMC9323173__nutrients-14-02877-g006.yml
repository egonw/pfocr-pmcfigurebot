caption: 'GKA4 regulated AMPK, SIRT1, PI3K, and AKT protein expression in cisplatin-induced
  AKI mice. Kidney tissue lysate was subjected to western blot analysis using antibodies
  specific to AMPK, p-AMPK SIRT1, PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT, and p-AKT. GKA4 regulated AMPK/SIRT1
  signal (A) and PI3K/AKT signal pathway (B). Protein bands were analyzed by densitometric
  analysis. Experiments were performed at least three times, and representative images
  are shown. Plus signs: with drug; Minus signs: without drug.'
