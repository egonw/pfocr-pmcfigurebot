figure_title: Cytokines expression levels in SCLC
caption: Expression level of a panel of cytokine genes in (a) H209, (b) H889 and (c)
  DMS114 cell line in response to CPT and LMP776. Data are represented as mean of
  two biological replicates ± SEM; P values are indicated on the top of each bar and
  they are calculated as one-tailed ratio paired t test; same experimental condition
  of Fig. . For (a–c), nd = not determined value because under detection level. Western
  blot of (d) STING protein and (e) cGAS protein level in several cell types. TOP1
  protein levels are also shown. Red ponceau as loading control is in Supplementary
  Fig. . Fold change (FC) represent quantification values compared to HeLa cells (normalised
  on red ponceau). mRNA quantification of (f) STING and (g) cGAS gene level in HeLa
  and lung cancer cell lines. Expression levels were determined by qRT-PCR and normalised
  on cytochrome c transcript.
article_title: Topoisomerase I poison-triggered immune gene activation is markedly
  reduced in human small-cell lung cancers by impairment of the cGAS/STING pathway.
