caption: (A) Domain structures of Nrf2. (B) Domain structures of Keap1. (C) Regulatory
  mechanism of Keap1 on the cellular abundance of Nrf2. Under physiological conditions,
  Keap1 serves as a link between Nrf2 and Cul3, promoting the rapid degradation of
  Nrf2 in the cytoplasm through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. When cells suffer
  oxidative stress damage, the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction is disrupted, and Nrf2 translocates
  to the nucleus, forming a heterodimerization complex with sMAF. Nrf2-sMAf heterodimers
  recognize ARE sequences and activate the transcription of antioxidant genes, such
  as HO-1 and NQO1.
