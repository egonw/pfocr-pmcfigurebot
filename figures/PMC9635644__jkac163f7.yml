caption: Enteric P.e. infection downregulates the expression of signaling molecules
  independently of Imd signaling. qPCR analysis of selected signaling molecule mRNA
  levels from control (w1118) vs imd mutant adult females, that were either mock-infected
  (grey bars and symbols) or infected by oral feeding with P.e. for 24 h (blue bars
  and symbols). Bars represent mean±SEM. Symbols represent individual data points,
  n = 4–6 per condition. *P < 0.05, 2-way ANOVA, followed by Student’s t-test.
