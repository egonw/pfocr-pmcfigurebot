figure_title: Proteogenomic insights into the Metabolic subtype reveal activated oncogenic
  pathways, enhanced cell cycle signaling and HRD signature
caption: 'a Heatmap showing the abundance of key proteins in the MAPK pathway and/or
  PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. For each sample, ssGSEA enrichment score of MAPK- or PI3K-related
  pathways represents the sample’s own MAPK or PI3K/Akt/mTOR signature score, which
  is annotated above the heatmap with details shown on the left. b Boxplots showing
  the abundance of STMN1 S16 and S46 phosphosites across the three proteomic subtypes.
  For the boxplots: line in the box indicates the median; box borders correspond with
  the first and third quartiles (25th and 75th percentiles); whiskers extend 1.5 times
  the interquartile range; outlier data are shown as dots. c Distribution of CCND1
  gains (left panel) and CDKN2A/CDKN2B losses (right panel) between the Metabolic
  subtype and other subtypes. d Boxplots showing the abundance of key cell cycle-related
  proteins CDK4, CDKN2C, E2F4, PCNA and RB1 across the three proteomic subtypes. P-values
  are calculated with Student’s t-test. For the boxplots: line in the box indicates
  the median; box borders correspond with the first and third quartiles (25th and
  75th percentiles); whiskers extend 1.5 times the interquartile range; outlier data
  are shown as dots. e Boxplot comparing the E2F activity score across the three proteomic
  subtypes. P-values are calculated with Student’s t-test. For the boxplot: line in
  the box indicates the median; box borders correspond with the first and third quartiles
  (25th and 75th percentiles); whiskers extend 1.5 times the interquartile range;
  outlier data are shown as dots. f Histogram comparing the HRD score across the three
  proteomic subtypes. P-values are calculated with Student’s t-test. g Distribution
  of copy number losses/deletions of common DDR-related genes in the Metabolic subtype.
  The 33 Metabolic tumors are arranged in descending order based on HRD score. See
  also Supplementary Fig.  and Table .'
