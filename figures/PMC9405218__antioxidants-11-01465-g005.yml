caption: 'ICS II protected against OGD-induced cardiomyocyte injury: (a) effect of
  ICS II on cardiomyocytes (n = 6); (b) cell viability was detected via the MTT assay
  (n = 6); (c) cytotoxicity was determined using the LDH assay (n = 6); (d) Tn level
  (n = 6); (e) TnT level (n = 6); (f) the morphology of cardiomyocytes was observed
  using a reverse-phase microscope. Magnification ×100; scale bar, 100 μm. #p < 0.05,
  ##p < 0.01 vs. control; ** p < 0.01 vs. OGD.'
