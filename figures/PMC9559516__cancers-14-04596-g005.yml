caption: Crosstalk Between RKIP and EPCAM. RKIP inhibits the MEK/ERK signaling pathway
  by interrupting the interaction between Raf and MEK, stopping the progression of
  the signal through the pathway. Erk 2 is an inhibitor of GEF-H1, an activator of
  RhoA which helps in the stabilization of E-cadherin at adherens junctions. EPCAM
  regulates nectin1 which plays a role in E-cadherins ability to function as an adhesion
  molecule.
