caption: 'Gene ontology analysis of all proteins considered altered throughout the
  analyzed reports. A gene ontology approach was used to assess pathway impact and
  enrichment (here presented by the p-value and color scheme in (A)) of all proteins
  described as altered between controls and SCZ in at least one study (), represented
  here as a scatter plot []. The blue circle highlights a cluster of ontologies, all
  belonging to metabolic pathways. From the pathways shown as enriched by this list
  of proteins, two were selected and their visual representation was obtained through
  the KEGG Mapper Color tool [,]: (B) cholesterol metabolism and (C) complement and
  coagulation cascades. In these KEGG panels, the proteins found in any of the studies
  are shown in orange, and proteins found to be altered in at least two studies are
  highlighted in red or blue when the protein is always found to be up- or down-regulated
  in SCZ cases (respectively) or highlighted in green when the results from the two
  or more studies are contradictory.'
