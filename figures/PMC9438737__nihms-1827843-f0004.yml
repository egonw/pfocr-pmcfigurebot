caption: Targetable signaling pathways are upregulated in inflamed and anti-TNF refractory
  samples. (A) Heatmap of enriched pathways from IPA sorted by the pathway activation
  z-score for the colon vs the ileum with the border bolded for significant (adjusted
  P ≤ .05) enrichment. The title of each column lists the 2 compared groups. A positive
  (red) z-score indicates pathway upregulation in the first group, whereas a negative
  (blue) z-score indicates pathway upregulation in the second group. Gray indicates
  undirected pathway enrichment (the z-score could not be calculated). (B) Simplified
  upstream regulatory network of the STAT3 pathway in anti-TNF–treated ileum samples.
  The red color intensity of each gene correlates with a positive z-score (upregulation)
  in inflamed anti-TNF–treated ileum samples.
