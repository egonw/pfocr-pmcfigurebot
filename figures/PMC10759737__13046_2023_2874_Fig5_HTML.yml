caption: The suppressed BM of NSCLC and attenuated SPHK2/S1P/STAT3 pathway in xenograft
  and zebrafish model by RPTOR blockade. A-J PC-9 cells were injected intravenously
  to construct the BM mouse model. Fluorescence microscopy showed that RPTOR blockade
  significantly suppressed the BM formation, the fluorescence of tumor cells in the
  ROI of BM, the expression of the proliferation marker Ki67 and MVD in the peritumoral
  area, prolonging overall survival (200 × magnification, scale bar = 50 μm). RPTOR
  overexpression produced the opposite effects. K Effects of RPTOR expression on the
  expression of proteins in BM tissue samples in nude mice. RPTOR knockdown reduced
  the expressions of RPTOR, YY1, SPHK2, and S1P1, with RPTOR overexpression yielding
  the opposite effects (200 × magnification, scale bar = 50 μm). L-O H1299 and PC9
  cells bearing vectors for RPTOR knockdown or overexpression were injected into the
  perivitelline space of zebrafish embryos. The number of cancer cells at days 1 and
  3 after the injection was significantly higher in the RPTOR-overexpressed group
  than in their respective control groups, whereas the number of cancer cells at days
  1 and 3 after injection was significantly lower in RPTOR-knockdown cells than in
  control cells
