figure_title: 'Non-nuclear effects of icariin affect osteoblast proliferation and
  signaling pathway activation: (A) The proliferation of osteoblasts in each group
  was detected by MTT assay. MTT results show that icariin (ICA)-bovine serum albumin
  (BSA) conjugate treatment (group B) significantly promoted the proliferation of
  osteoblasts compared with ICA (group A), ICA-BSA + ICI182780 (group C), and ICA-BSA
  + PD98059 (group D); (B) The cell cycle of osteoblasts in each group was detected
  by flow cytometry. Group A: ICA, group B: ICA-BSA, group C: ICA-BSA + ICI182780,
  group D: ICA-BSA + PD98059; (C) Protein expression levels of extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK)1/2 and phospho (p)-ERK1/2 in each group; (D) The relative expression
  levels of ERK1/2 and P-ERK1/2 proteins in each group. Group A: ICA, group B: ICA-BSA,
  group C: ICA-BSA + ICI182780 , group D: ICA-BSA + PD98059, * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01'
