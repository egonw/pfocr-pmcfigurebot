caption: 'Escin-induced TOPFlash activity was abrogated by sFRP1 and sFRP2 treatment.
  WRHEK293A Wnt reporter cells were treated with escin in the presence of sFRP1or
  sFRP2 for 24 h. The cells were lysed, and GFP expression and TOPFlash activity were
  measured. Escin-induced TOPFlash activity was markedly abrogated by sFRP1 or sFRP2.
  Data are expressed as mean ± SD (n = 5). # p < 0.05 compared to the non-treated
  control. ** p < 0.01 compared to escin-treated control.'
