caption: 'The dynamic microenvironment metabolism is used for symbiotic metabolic
  reprogramming in tumors. Cancerâ€™s metabolic dependence can be reprogrammed by environmental
  stress. This suggests that cancer cells may employ a variety of catabolic metabolites
  to generate energy (acronyms: GLUT: glucose transporters, MTC: monocarboxylate transporters,
  TCA cycle: tricarboxylic acid cycle, FAO: fatty acid oxidation, ATP: adenosine triphosphate,
  NADH: reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, PPP: pentose phosphate pathway,
  OXPHOS: oxidative phosphorylation). (This figure was drawn using the Bio Render
  app).'
