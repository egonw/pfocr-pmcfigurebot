caption: 'The mechanistic pathways by which rifampicin induces ER stress. Rifampicin
  is transported to the liver via blood circulation and enters hepatocytes via OATP1B1.
  Rifampin can stimulate the expression of CYP enzymes by activating PXR and then
  promote the IRE1-XBP1 signaling pathway to cause ER stress, resulting in cell apoptosis.
  On the other hand, after entering hepatocytes rifampicin reduces the expression
  of BSEP possibly by suppressing the activity of NRF2, leading to the accumulation
  of bile acids in hepatocytes. Accumulated bile acids interrupt protein folding and
  cause a large amount of unfolded protein. The unfolded protein competes to bind
  GRP78 also known as BiP in the GRP78/PERK complex, allowing PERK activation. PERK
  homodimerization occurs after being phosphorylated. The PERK dimer activates the
  ATF4-CHOP signaling pathway and promotes cell survival by switching on the NRF2-dependent
  self-protection mechanism. Abbreviations: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; OATP1B1, organic
  anion transporting polypeptides1B1; CYP, cytochrome p450; PXR, pregnane X receptor;
  IRE1, Inositol-requiring enzyme 1; XBP1, X-box binding protein 1; GRP78, glycoregulatory
  protein 78; PERK, protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase; ATF4, transcription
  factor 4; CHOP, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homolog protein; NRF2, nuclear factor
  E2-related factor 2.'
