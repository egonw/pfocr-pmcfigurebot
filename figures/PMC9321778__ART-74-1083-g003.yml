caption: Elevated inflammatory signals in PBMCs from patients with the PSMD12 variant.
  A, Western blots of interferon (IFN) signaling pathway–involved proteins in poly(I‐C)–stimulated
  PBMCs from patients 1 and 2 and control subjects. Results shown are representative
  of 2 independent experiments. B, Levels of the cytokines interleukin‐6 (IL‐6), tumor
  necrosis factor (TNF), and IL‐1β in cultured supernatants of PBMCs from patient
  2 and 6 control subjects, measured by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay. C and D,
  Expression levels of IFN‐stimulated genes in PBMCs from patient 2 and 3 control
  subjects. PBMCs were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (C) or IFNβ (D) or were
  left untreated. ** = P < 0.01; *** = P < 0.001; **** = P < 0.0001. E, Concentrations
  of the proinflammatory cytokines IL‐8, IFNγ, and IL‐1β and the chemokine IFNγ‐inducible
  protein 10 (IP‐10) in serum from patients 1 and 2 and from control subjects, determined
  by cytometric bead array analysis. Two samples from each subject, obtained at different
  times, were assessed. F, Expression patterns of genes involved in the IFN and NF‐κB
  signaling pathways in PBMCs from patients 1 and 2, healthy control subjects, and
  disease controls, determined by RNA sequencing. G, IFN response gene scores (28‐gene,
  25‐gene, and 3‐gene) and NF‐κB score (11‐gene) in the 2 patients (PA), healthy controls,
  and disease controls (DC), determined using bulk RNA sequencing data. H, Expression
  levels of IFN pathway genes in LPS‐stimulated PBMCs from patients 1 and 2 and healthy
  controls, with and without baricitinib (Bari) treatment. In B–E, G, and H, symbols
  represent individual samples; for healthy controls (and for studies in which >1
  sample from each of the 2 patients was assessed), bars show the mean ± SEM. MDA5
  = myeloma differentiation–associated protein 5; RIG‐I = retinoic acid–inducible
  gene I; IRF3 = IFN regulatory factor 3; IFIT3 = IFN‐induced protein with tetratricopeptide
  repeats 3; SLE = systemic lupus erythematosus; CRIA = cleavage‐resistant receptor‐interacting
  protein kinase 1–induced autoinflammatory; DADA2 = deficiency of adenosine deaminase
  2; (see Figure  for other definitions).
