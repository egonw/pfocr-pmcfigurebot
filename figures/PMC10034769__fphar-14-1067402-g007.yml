caption: 'Urolithin A (UA) inhibited ferroptosis by activating Nrf2. (A) Typical images
  showed the H&E staining in lung tissue. (B,D,E) A typical IHC image showed the GPX4
  and 4-HNE expression in lung tissues. (C,F) Typical IF images showed GPX4 expression
  in BEAS-2B cells. The results were represented by mean Â± SD. ## p < 0.01, ** p <
  0.01, &&p < 0.01 in comparison to control, LPS and LPS + UA groups, respectively.'
