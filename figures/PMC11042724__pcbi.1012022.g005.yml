caption: (A) Scatter plot of the pathways represented by predictive UM-CLL signature
  PSNs that StellarPath found during training. The X-axis indicates the rank of separability
  between the two classes. The Y-axis indicates the name of the pathways. The size
  of the dot depends on the smallest similarity (low percentile of the Separability
  Power system) between UM-CLL patients which is higher than the highest similarity
  (high percentile) between M-CLL patients. The color indicates how the UM-CLL subtype
  is deregulating the pathway. (B) Violin plot of the classification performances
  assessed comparing the predicted classes of the unknown patients to their true subtype.
  (C) UM-CLL signature PSN of the activated B Cell Receptor Signaling Pathway of Power
  2, where UM-CLL patients are represented by green nodes, M-CLL patients by blue
  nodes, green lines represent edges between UM-CLL nodes, grey lines represent inter-similarities
  and blue lines are between M-CLL nodes. A line thickness represents the similarity
  value associated with it. The size of the node is determined by the patient’s centrality.
  The PSN is sparse because the edges with low similarity have been hidden. Thanks
  to StellarPath’s plot function, the PSN represents 123 patients in 20 nodes.
