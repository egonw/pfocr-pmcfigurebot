caption: 'Mechanisms by which respiratory microbiota influence CF lung disease. (A)
  Members of the CF microbiota have been associated with risk of infection in the
  airways. Colonization of commensal microbiota, such as Porphyromonas catoniae was
  found as a biomarker associated with a lower risk of P. aeruginosa (PA) early infection
  in CF []. In contrast, infection of Streptococcus milleri/anginosus group (SMG)
  at the onset of pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) is associated with symptomatic deterioration
  in clinical status, whereas its relative reduction is associated with symptom resolution
  (unlike canonical pathogens, such as P. aeruginosa) [, ]. (B) Commensal bacteria
  may negatively or positively influence the virulence of CF pathogens. Co-infection
  models in human epithelial cell lines with P. aeruginosa and commensal CF microbiota
  have shown that different strains of Streptococcus mitis reduce P. aeruginosa-induced
  inflammation through reduction of interleukin 8 (IL-8) production and neutrophil
  extracellular trap (NET) formation. The mechanism of action is still unknown but
  thought to be through modification of the micro-environment by metabolism adjustment
  by the commensal bacteria []. In contrast, some oral commensal streptococci enhance
  P. aeruginosa pathogenicity by increasing its virulence factor expression (eg, pyocyanin
  and elastase) [, , ]. (C) The CF microbiota contain bacteria with immunomodulatory
  activity that may alter host inflammatory response, which in turn could influence
  the progression of lung disease. Rothia mucilaginosa potentially mitigates host
  inflammation through the inhibition of the IL-8 production and NF-κB pathway activation
  in a human lung epithelial cell line []. Conversely, Prevotella intermedia was reported
  to be able to contribute to disease progression by secretion of cytotoxic extracellular
  toxins that induce the influx of macrophages and neutrophils in the airway lumen
  []. (D) CF microbiota influence disease through the modulation of extrinsic therapies.
  Extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs)-producing Prevotella isolates were reported
  to influence pathogenesis in vitro by shielding pathogens, such as P. aeruginosa
  from the action of β-lactam antibiotics []. (E) CF microbiota may be affected by
  a range of external factors, including pollution, diet, and viruses. Pollution may
  play a role in triggering PEx, leading to microbiota changes and further airway
  irritation and injury, which consequently could affect the extent of respiratory
  infections []. In the gut-lung axis, diet plays an important role in shaping the
  composition of the gut microbiota. Metabolites produced by the gut microbiota not
  only modulate gastrointestinal immunity but also impact immune responses in the
  lung [, ]. Bacteriophages may impact the fitness of members of the CF microbiota
  through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of antimicrobial resistance genes []. Additionally,
  the progression of lung disease is influenced by infection with respiratory viruses
  which could indirectly promote community changes and host response []. Figure created
