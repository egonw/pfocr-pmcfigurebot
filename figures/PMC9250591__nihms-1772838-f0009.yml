figure_title: SHH expression after chorda tympani (CT)/lingual (LN) nerve cut
caption: (A) Antibody detection of SHH (red) and taste bud cells (K8, green) in the
  Control side of tongue, in Typical FP/TB, and (B) in contralateral tongue, in Atypical
  FP/No TB after 21 days of CT/LN nerve cut. There is loss of SHH in association with
  loss of TB cells.
