figure_title: RNA seq analysis reveals that muscle-expressed NUAK preferentially alters
  gene expression of insulin pathway targets
caption: (A) Venn diagram depicting the number of common genes detected in whole larvae
  and/or muscle carcass in mef2>NUAK 548 vs. mef2>lacZ (top panel) or mef2>NUAK 550
  vs. mef2>lacZ (bottom panel). (B) Bar graph illustrates the relative percentage
  of up/down-regulated genes in whole larvae compared to muscle carcass upon NUAK
  OE. (C) Enrichment of insulin pathway target genes compared to target genes associated
  with TGFβ signaling in muscles expressing NUAK. (D) Heatmap depicting relative fold
  change (log2) of the top up- or down-regulated genes detected in whole larvae (top
  panel) or muscle carcass (bottom panel) in mef2>NUAK 548 or mef2>NUAK 550 compared
  to mef2>lacZ controls. Gene names in bold are common between whole larvae and muscle
  carcass data sets. ** indicates known insulin pathway target genes. (E) Bar graph
  showing the relative fold change of shared gene targets (CryAB, GILT3, NUAK, mthl8)
  and/or known insulin pathway targets (CryAB, CG32698, Thor) upon NUAK OE. (F) Western
  blot confirming upregulation of CryAB protein after expression of either FOXO or
  NUAK 548 in muscle tissue. Relative fold change is indicated below the ATP5α blot,
  which was used as a loading control. (G) RT-PCR of mthl8 transcript is undetectable
  in mef2>lacZ larvae, but is present in mef2>FOXO or mef2>NUAK 548 larvae. rp49 is
  used as a control.
