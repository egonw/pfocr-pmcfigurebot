caption: FMDV 3Cpro inhibits nuclear translocation of STAT1 as directed by IFA. HeLa
  cells transfected with pXJ41, pXJ41-3C, or individual mutants of pXJ41-3C were either
  left untreated (−) or treated (+) with human 100 ​ng/mL IFN-γ for 1 ​h at 18 ​h
  post-transfection. Cells were fixed, and an IFA was conducted. Yellow arrows indicate
  WT or mutated 3Cpro-expressing cells, and white arrows indicate untransfected cells.
  Scale bar, 10 ​μm.
