caption: The expression of ATF-2 and Wnt pathway proteins in lung cancer tissues and
  cells was detected. (aâ€“c) The expression of ATF-2 in lung cancer cells and HBE was
  detected by qPCR and WB. (d, e) qPCR and WB were used to detect the expression of
  Wnt pathway proteins in lung cancer cells and normal cells. (f) The expression of
  ATF-2 in lung cancer cells was detected by IHC.
