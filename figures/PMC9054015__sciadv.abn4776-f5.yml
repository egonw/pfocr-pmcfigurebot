figure_title: ML classification reveals that nonlesional skin of DLE, PSO, and AD
  is distinct from control skin
caption: (A) ROC curve and (B) PR curve of nonlesional DLE, nonlesional PSO, and nonlesional
  AD samples compared to pooled control samples using all cellular and pathway gene
  signatures. The top 15 features important in classifying (C) nonlesional DLE, (D)
  nonlesional PSO, and (E) nonlesional AD and control samples using Gini feature importance.
  (F) Comparison of the top 15 features for classifying each nonlesional disease compared
  to control using Gini feature importance. (G) Classification metrics to properly
  separate nonlesional DLE and control samples, nonlesional PSO, and control samples,
  as well as nonlesional AD and control samples using all 48 (top) or the top 15 (bottom)
  cellular and pathway gene signatures. Refer to table S3 (A and B) for ML details.
  Collinear features were removed (fig. S12).
