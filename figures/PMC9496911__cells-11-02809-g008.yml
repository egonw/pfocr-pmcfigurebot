caption: Immunofluorescence double staining of Nrf2 and NLRP3 in PC12 cells treated
  with H2O2. Immunofluorescence double staining was performed to test the protein
  level of Nrf2 (A,B) and NLRP3 (C,D) in PC12 cells from each group (n = 8, scale
  bar = 100 µm). Data are shown as the means ± SD; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p
  < 0.001.
