caption: Models showing that iRhom2 is a positive regulator of alcohol-induced liver
  fibrosis; iRhom2 plays an important role in regulating the progression of liver
  fibrosis in alcohol-exposed mice, most likely by activating the TACE/TNFRs/NF-κB
  signaling pathway to promote inflammation. In addition, iRhom2 exacerbates liver
  fibrotic lesions by activating JNK expression to enhance oxidative stress via the
  Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.
