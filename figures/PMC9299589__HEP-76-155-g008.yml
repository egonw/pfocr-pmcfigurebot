caption: 'Multiomics analysis revealed that the MAPK pathway is the downstream target
  of breviscapine. (A) GSEA and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the transcriptomes
  of cells and HFHC diet–fed mouse liver samples. n = 3 independent experiments per
  group for cells, n = 5 per group for tissues. (B) Venn diagram of GSEA and KEGG
  pathway intersections based on transcriptome data both in vivo and in vitro. The
  histogram of the two key pathways is based on the corresponding scores. n = 3 independent
  experiments per group for cells, n = 5 per group for tissues. (C) Scatterplot showing
  the fold changes in all proteins in the proteomic data set, with differentially
  expressed proteins shown with corresponding font colors (inflammation in blue, lipid
  metabolism in yellow, fibrosis in red, apoptosis in purple). n = 3 per group. (D)
  Heatmap showing the degrees of influence of pathways related to lipid metabolism
  and inflammation based on a proteomic data set. n = 3 per group. (E) PPI network
  diagram of multiomics joint analysis. n = 3 per group. (F) Bar chart of phosphorylated
  proteins ranked according to PPI degree. n = 3 per group. (G) Western blot analysis
  of proteins involved in the MAPK signaling cascade in cells stimulated with PA and
  mice subjected to HFD or HFHC feeding. GAPDH served as a loading control. n = 3
  per group. The data are presented as the mean ± SD. Significant difference between
  the DMSO/control group and the breviscapine group, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. The data
  were analyzed with one‐way ANOVA. Abbreviations: Bre, breviscapine; FDR, false discovery
  rate; Hspa8, heat shock protein a8; RIG‐I, retinoic acid–inducible gene I'
