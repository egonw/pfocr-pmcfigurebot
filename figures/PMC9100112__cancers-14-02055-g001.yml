caption: Active gp130/STAT3 pathway in PANC-1 sphere cells. (A) Real-time qPCR analysis
  of IL-6, LIF, IL-6R, LIFR, and gp130 in PANC-1 cells cultured in 2D (adherent) or
  3D (sphere) conditions. The results presented are normalized to values obtained
  for adherent cells (value = 1). Results are presented as means ± SD from three independent
  experiments. (B) FACS analysis of IL-6R, LIFR, and gp130 expression in PANC-1 cells
  cultured in 2D (adherent) or 3D (sphere) conditions. Controls are indicated by thin
  lines with gray color. (C) Cell surface levels of IL-6R, LIFR, and gp130 expression
  in PANC-1 cells cultured in 2D (adherent) or 3D (sphere) conditions. Mean fluorescence
  intensities (MFIs) relative to those of adherent cells are presented. Results are
  presented as means ± SD from three independent experiments. (D) Western blot analysis
  of p-gp130, gp130, p-STAT3, and STAT3 was performed in PANC-1 cells cultured in
  2D (adherent) or 3D (sphere) conditions. Relative band intensity is provided. **
  p < 0.01.
