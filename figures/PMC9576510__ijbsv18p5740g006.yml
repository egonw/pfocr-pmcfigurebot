caption: CIDEC promotes lipid deposition by enhancing AGPAT enzyme activity. (A) mRNA
  expression of two isoforms of CIDEC (n=3-4); 22-week-old mice modeled by feeding
  a high-fgat diet from 8 weeks of age were used. (B-E) After the introduction of
  CIDEC-l or vector, IPEC-J2 cells induced by high-fat for 48 hours were used (n=3-4);
  (B) Intracellular and extracellular triglyceride (TG) concentration; (C) Intracellular
  and extracellular total cholesterol (TC) concentration; (D) Lipase activity; (E)
  mRNA expression of enzymes involved in lipid absorption (NPC1L1, SR-B1, CD36), transportation
  (FATP1, FATP4), synthesis (DGAT2), secretion (MTP, APOB), lipolysis (ATGL, HSL,
  MGL) and oxidative metabolism (AMPKα, PPARα) in cells normalized to GAPDH; (F) SDS-PAGE
  stained by Coomassie brilliant blue. Protein immunoprecipitated from total intestinal
  protein of wild-type mice (no flox) fed a normal diet. Input, total intestinal protein;
  control IgG, immunoprecipitated protein using negative control mouse IgG antibody;
  CIDEC, immunoprecipitated protein using CIDEC antibody. (G) Intestinal CIDEC-interacting
  protein enrichment KEGG analysis; (H) Phosphatidic acid concentrations in the middle
  and proximal intestine of mice fed a high-fat diet (n=3-5). Data are means ± SEM.
  Differences were considered significant at *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001. (I) Mechanism
  of CIDEC accelerating TG synthesis by the glycerol-3-phosphate pathway in the small
  intestine.
