caption: Schemes of the scaffolds with different pore morphologies and the scaffold-BMSC
  interaction mechanism. (A) 3D-printed scaffolds with cylindrical, gyroid, and diamond
  pore morphology. The insets show the structural unit of each scaffold. (B) Pore
  morphology mediated cytoskeletal forces and nuclear deformation of BMSCs to promote
  bone regeneration via the RhoA/ROCK2 signaling pathway.
