caption: ROS signal transduction response to salt stress. Salt stress induces a rapid
  increase in ROS accumulation. Sensors perceive the elevated ROS and transduce the
  ROS signal to stimulate plant responses. MAPK signaling cascades receive ROS signals
  and regulate the activity of the SOS pathway and ROS scavengers to modulate ionic
  homeostasis and ROS homeostasis, respectively. MAPKs also regulate gene expression
  to modulate plant growth under salt stress.
