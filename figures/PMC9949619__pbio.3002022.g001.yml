figure_title: Evolutionary conservation of the innate immune pattern recognition receptor
  NLR family and the induction of III-RCD pathways
caption: (A) Phylogenetic tree of NACHT domain-containing proteins, including the
  NLR family of pattern recognition receptors, from select bacterial and eukaryotic
  phyla. The tree was built using IQTREE2 phylogenetic software with protein sequences
  from Mollusca (Candidula unifasciata), Proteobacteria (Pseudomonas fluorescens),
  Nematoda (Caenorhabditis elegans), Arthropoda (Drosophila melanogaster), Chlorophyta
  (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii), Ascomycota (Aspergillus niger), Streptophyta (Selaginella
  moellendorffii), Chordata (Mus musculus), Porifera (Amphimedon queenslandica), Firmicutes
  (Roseburia inulinoivorans), Rotifera (Adineta ricciae), Bacteriodetes (Chryseobacterium
  oleae), Cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa), and Acidobacteria (Luteitalea pratensis).
  (B) Cell death pathways can be divided into lytic and nonlytic categories, with
  distinct features and pathways in each. (C) A simplified schematic representation
  of lytic cell death pathway mechanisms. Inflammasomes (pyroptosis), PANoptosomes
  (PANoptosis), and necrosomes (necroptosis) induce lytic regulated cell death pathways.
  Another recently described form of lytic cell death, ferroptosis, does not have
  a specific cell death-inducing complex identified to date. In PANoptosomes, crosstalk
  and redundancies between caspase-1, caspase-8, and/or RIPK molecules can occur to
  drive cell death. Pyroptosis and PANoptosis depend on the activation of caspases,
  while necroptosis depends on the inhibition of caspase-8. In contrast, ferroptosis
  occurs in response to GPX-4 inhibition. DAMPs, damage-associated molecular patterns;
  GPX-4, glutathione peroxidase 4; GSDMD, gasdermin D; GSDME, gasdermin E; III-RCD,
  innate immune inflammatory regulated cell death; IL, interleukin; MLKL, mixed lineage
  kinase domain-like; NLR, NOD-like receptor; RIPK, receptor interacting protein kinase;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; TNF, tumor necrosis factor. Figure created with components
  from BioRender.
