caption: CCL2 and CCL7 levels were increased in OVX and aged female mice. (A, B) The
  serum concentrations of CCL2 and CCL7 were increased in OVX mice on days 15 and
  75, but the increases were attenuated by E2 and Bnd (all P < 0.005). However, the
  differences were not significant on days 30 and 45 among the sham, OVX, E2 and Bnd
  groups (all P ≥ 0.13). The serum concentrations of CCL2 and CCL7 in aged mice were
  higher than those in the other groups (all P < 0.05) except for the OVX group on
  days 15 and 75 (both P ≥ 0.09). (C, D) The mRNA expression of CCL2 and CCL7 in BMMs
  was increased in OVX mice at all time points and in aged mice compared to sham mice
  (all P < 0.01); however, E2 and Bnd attenuated these increases significantly. The
  mRNA expression in the aged group was not different from that in the OVX group but
  was higher than that in the sham, E2 and Bnd groups. One‐way ANOVA and Tukey's test;
  ns, not significant; *P < 0.01, **P < 0.001.
