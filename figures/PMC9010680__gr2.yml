caption: Overview of the potential pathway by which probiotics affect reproductive
  health in both males and females as well as their offspring. 1. Probiotic supplements
  have positive effects on testicular function, improving semen quality, which may
  influence couple and offspring health through sexual intercourse. 2. Probiotic supplements
  can modulate the microbiota composition of the gut and regulate the metabolism of
  the female, thus impacting microbiome configuration, biofilm integrity, and the
  immune response of female reproductive organs. The affected female reproductive
  tract then influences the health of infants through mother-to-child transmission.
  Additionally, probiotic supplements can influence bacterial transmission from the
  gut to milk, and then influence infant health through breast feeding. 3. Probiotics
  may also act through the vagina by changing its microbiota composition directly
  and balancing its microbial ecology, thus contributing to vaginal reproductive health.
