caption: Klotho expression patterns of UDSCs. (A) The Klotho gene expression level
  was analyzed by real-time PCR using cell lysates. (B) The Klotho protein expression
  level was detected by Western blotting using cell lysates and supernatants. (C)
  The Klotho protein concentration was quantified by ELISA using cell lysates and
  supernatants. The results are shown as the mean ± SEM. (D) The Klotho expression
  was visualized by fluorescence staining (green) in UDSCs.
