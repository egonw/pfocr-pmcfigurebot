caption: Transcriptional profiles in BRAFV600E mutant MaMel cells. A Principal component
  analysis (PCA) for the transcriptomic profiles from MaMel cells. The projections
  of the first two principal components (PC1–PC2) are shown, with the percentage of
  variance explained by each one indicated in brackets. B Self-organizing maps of
  MaMel transcriptomes. Clusters of over- (red) and under- (blue) expressed genes
  are indicated with black arrows. Significantly enriched (p < 0.05) biological processes
  are annotated for each cluster. C Enrichment of proliferative and invasive melanoma
  signatures [, ] in MaMel cells. D Normalized expression (z-score) from genes corresponding
  to the proliferative and invasive melanoma signatures
article_title: PI3K/AKT signaling allows for MAPK/ERK pathway independency mediating
  dedifferentiation-driven treatment resistance in melanoma.
