caption: 'The activation of the Raf-1/MEK/MAPK/ERK signaling pathway in mice with
  OVA-induced asthma was detected by Western blot. Western blot was performed in six
  independent mice. ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. control; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, and ###P < 0.001
  vs. model; &P < 0.05, &&P < 0.01, and &&&P < 0.001 vs. model+DNM.'
