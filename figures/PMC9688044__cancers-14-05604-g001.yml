caption: 'Evaluation of the performance of drug response prediction when using only
  panel-seq features (mutations and/or copy number variations) or using transcriptome
  features in combination with panel-seq features (multi-omics). (A) Improvement of
  multi-omics (as in R-square metric) in comparison to panel-seq features for the
  testing portion of BeatAML (left panel) and CCLE (right panel) datasets for 106
  and 396 drugs, respectively. (B) Correlation of the prediction performance improvement
  (multi-omics vs. panel-seq) with respect to the proportion of transcriptome features
  among the top 100 most important predictors of drug response for CCLE datasets.
  (C) Improvement of multi-omics (in red) (as in R-square metric) in comparison to
  panel-seq features (in blue) for the testing portion of the PDX dataset for 12 drugs.
  Stars above the boxplots represent significance levels: *** for p < 0.001, ** for
  p < 0.01, * for p < 0.05. (D) Drug classes with loose pathway specificity show higher
  average improvement in MO over PS. Drug classes (y-axis) are ordered by average
  improvement in MO and filtered to keep only those that have a minimum of five drugs
  in a class. The dashed line corresponds to the global average improvement in MO
  (0.051) as reported in figure panel (C).'
