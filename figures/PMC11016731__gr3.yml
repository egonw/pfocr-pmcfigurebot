caption: The mechanism of action of targeted agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors
  and the synergistic effect of their combined treatment. The combination of VEGF
  and VEGFR activates PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, which further promotes the
  progress of tumor cells. The hypoxia environment of tumor cells and the inactivation
  of VHL gene lead to the increase of HIF-1α and HIF-1β heterodimers, which further
  activates the signal transduction pathway. The presence of VEGF enhances the function
  of Tregs and MDSCs and inhibits the maturation of DCs, ultimately leading to suppression
  of T-cell activation.Targeted therapeutic drugs can effectively inhibit VEGF and
  its signalling pathways and exert an anti-tumour effect. CTLA-4 and CD28 on T cells
  can compete with B7 ligands (CD80 and CD86) expressed on APC. However, the affinity
  of CTLA-4 to B7 ligands is significantly higher than that of CD28, which can induce
  downstream inhibition signals and inhibit T cell activation. Tumor cells can use
  the interaction of PD-1 and PD-L1/L2 to release inhibitory signals to escape antigen-specific
  T cell immune response. Immune checkpoint inhibitors against CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1
  can restore effective anti-tumor immunity. It is clear from the above that the use
  of target agents enhances the anti-tumour activity of the immune system, thereby
  increasing the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, and therefore they have
  a synergistic effect.
