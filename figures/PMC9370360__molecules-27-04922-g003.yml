caption: 'The mechanism of action of RAGE–ligand binding in RA. The binding of RAGE
  with the ligand activates the MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway and induces the production
  of inflammatory factors. sRAGE can block the ligand–RAGE interaction on the cell
  surface, reducing the entry of inflammatory cells into the joint cavity. Abbreviations:
  RAGE: receptor for advanced glycation end products; sRAGE: soluble receptor for
  advanced glycation end products; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; NF-κB:
  nuclear factor kappa-B; IκB: inhibitor of NF-κB; TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor α;
  IL-1: interleukin-1; IL-17: interleukin-17.'
