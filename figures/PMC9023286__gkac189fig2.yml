caption: HDAC6 interacts with and deacetylates MOB1. (A) HEK293T cells expressing
  FLAG–MOB1 were treated with 5 mM nicotinamide or 3 μM TSA for 12 h before harvesting,
  and the lysates were detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the AcK11-MOB1
  Ab. (B) FLAG-MOB1 was co-transfected with HA–CBP and diverse histone deacetylase
  (HDACs) plasmids in HEK293T cells, and cell lysates were detected by SDS-PAGE and
  immunoblotting with indicated antibodies. (C) HEK293T cells were cotransfected with
  FLAG-MOB1, HA-CBP and HA-HDAC6, the lysates were analyzed by western blot analysis
  using indicated antibodies. (D) HEK293T cells, cotransfected with FLAG-MOB1 and
  HA-CBP, together with or without siRNA against HDAC6, were lysed. Lysates were detected
  by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with indicated antibodies. (E) HEK293T cells cotransfected
  with FLAG-MOB1 and HA-HDAC6 were treated with or without 3 μM TSA for 12 h before
  harvesting, followed by immunoblotting. (F–H) FLAG-MOB1 together with HA-HDAC6 (F),
  HA-MOB1 with FLAG-HDAC6 (G) or FLAG-HDAC6 separately (H) were transfected in HEK293T
  cells. Lysates were coimmunoprecipitated with M2–Beads (anti-FLAG) and then immunoblotted
  with indicated antibodies.
