figure_title: SARS-CoV-2 infection activates Hippo and antiviral RLR-STAT pathways
  in hPSC-CMs
caption: '(A) Confocal image analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (red) in infected
  cardiomyocytes shows extensive damage to cTNT positive (green) cells, which undergo
  apoptotic cell death (green; cleaved caspase 3). Scale bar: 5 μm; n = 6 independent
  experiments. (B) Western blot analyzes show activation of Hippo, RLR, and STAT1
  pathways. Phospho-YAP127 level is increased upon SARS-CoV-2 infection (MOI 0.01);
  n = 3 independent experiments. Density of bands compared to that of 2 hpi mock is
  provided for pYAP127 and YAP. (C) Immunohistochemistry analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Spike
  protein in infected hPSC-CMs at 48 hpi reveals cytoplasmic localization and depletion
  of YAP/TAZ and (D) increase in pYAP127 level. Scale bar: 25 μm. Insets denote total
  YAP or pYAP127 in infected cells, and white asterisks highlight uninfected cells.
  hPSC-CM, human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte; MOI, multiplicity of
  infection; SARS-CoV-2, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2.'
