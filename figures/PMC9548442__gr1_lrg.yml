caption: The innate antiviral type I IFN response and interactions with the AXL receptorInfection
  with SARS-CoV-2, and other RNA viruses, results in viral RNA (vRNA) in the cytoplasm
  or endosomes that triggers the activation of RLRs and TLRs, respectively. Downstream
  of vRNA-RLR interactions, RLRs interact with MAVS at mitochondrial membranes to
  facilitate the assembly of a signalosome where TBK1 and IKKε are recruited. TLR
  signaling activates TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)3 for downstream activation
  of TBK1/IKKε. These kinases then phosphorylate IRFs 3 and 7, which translocate to
  the nuclear to induce the expression of IFN-I. IFN-I signals through the IFNAR1
  to simulate the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2, resulting in the formation of
  ISGF3, which translocates to the nucleus to bind ISRE-containing promoters and facilitate
  the expression of ISGs. Gas6 is AXL’s natural ligand and activates AXL signaling
  that negatively regulates the IFN-I pathway. AXL is able to interact with IFNAR1,
  and this interaction results in the preferential formation of STAT1 homodimers.
  STAT1 activation then leads to the induction of SOCS 1 and 3, which inhibit TRAF3
  and JAK1, resulting in reduced activation of IFN-I induction and signaling pathways.
  Gilteritinib is a small molecule that inhibits AXL’s tyrosine kinase activity allowing
  for enhanced IFN-I induction following SARS-CoV-2 infection.
