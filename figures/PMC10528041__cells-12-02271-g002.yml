caption: Vitamin D and immunoregulatory function during viral infections. Vitamin
  D binding to VDR induces and/or represses the transcription of many genes. (1) Attachment
  of vitamin D to VDR on MCs upregulates the expression of IL-10, ultimately promoting
  an anti-inflammatory environment by inhibiting the P38 MAPK/NF-ÎºB pathway. (2) The
  immune response shifts from a Th1/Th17 pro-inflammatory profile to an anti-inflammatory
  Th2/Treg profile. (3) IL-5-activated plasma cells secrete different types of immunoglobulins.
  (4) The binary interplay between MCs and CD8+ T-cells results in the elimination
  of virus-infected B cells (such as EBV) through apoptosis. (5) NK cell activity
  can be enhanced by vitamin D in response to viral infections such as DENV and RSV,
  which trigger apoptosis in infected cells. (6) The expression of VDR and CYP27B1
  increases in macrophages upon formation of the vitamin D-VDR dimer, resulting in
  enhanced immune response to viral attacks.
