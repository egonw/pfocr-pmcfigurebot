caption: 'LMNA regulation of EMT in erlotinib-acquired resistant lung adenocarcinoma
  cells; morphological changes from an epithelial phenotype to a spindle-shaped EMT-like
  morphology in HCC827 cells after knockdown of LMNA. EMT-like morphology in HCC827/ER
  cells was reversed by overexpression of LMNA. Levels of laminA/C (green), E-cadherin
  (green), and vimentin (red) were determined by immunofluorescence assay. Nuclei
  were visualized using DAPI staining (blue). Data are presented mean ± SD from three
  independent experiments. Significant differences are indicated as follows: Student’s
  t-test, * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001.'
