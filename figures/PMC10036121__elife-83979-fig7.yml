caption: 'Representative traces (left) and averaged responses to 25 mM sucrose from
  L-type sensilla of flies fed a CD and SD (A), gray or Trametinib (C), blue. n =
  11–14. Unpaired t-test: ***p = 0.0001 for CD vs. SD, and p = 0.486 for CD Trametinib
  vs. SD Trametinib. Taste responses to stimulation of the proboscis with sucrose
  in flies fed a CD and SD + vehicle (B), DMSO, gray or Trametinib (D), blue. PER,
  n = 20–33. PER: two-way repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA), main effect
  of diet, vehicle p < 0.0001 and Trametinib p = 0.4701; Tukey multiple comparison
  test: vehicle CD vs. SD 30% p = 0.421, 10% **p = 0.0017, and 5% ***p = 0.0002 and
  Trametinib CD vs. SD 30% p = 0.9702, 10% p = 0.4470, and 5% p = 0.9575. Effect of
  Trametinib: CD vehicle vs. CD Trametinib, 30% p = 0.1745, 10% p = 0.0108, 5% p =
  0.0015; SD vehicle vs. SD Trametinib, 30% p = 0.4837, 10% p = 0.0228, 5% p = 0.2339.
  (E) A model for how O-GlcNAc Transferase (OGT), PRC2, and ERK orchestrate taste
  plasticity in response to a changing food environment. Boxes in pink describe the
  different steps of ‘information processing’ (see discussion). Data are shown as
  mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM).'
