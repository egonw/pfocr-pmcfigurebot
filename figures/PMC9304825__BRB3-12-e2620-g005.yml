caption: 'Effect of the SIS and combined treatment on function of fear memory extinction.
  The combination therapy of MK‐801 and L‐NNA resulted in lower freezing response.
  Values are expressed as the mean ± SEM (n = 5 in each group). Results were analyzed
  using one‐way ANOVA followed by Tukey''s post hoc test. IC compared to SC: ***p < .001;
  combined treatment compared to IC animals ###p < .001; combined treatment compared
  to IC+MK‐801: ∧∧∧p < .001; combined treatment compared to IC+L‐NNA: &&&p < .01'
