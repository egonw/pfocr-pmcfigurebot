figure_title: ADH1C functions as a suppressor of CRC in vivo
caption: a Photos of mice with xenograft tumors generated by HCT116 cells and HCT116
  cells with high ADH1C expression. b Overexpression of ADH1C inhibited growth of
  xenograft CRC tumors. c Photos of tumors generated by HCT116 cells with or without
  high ADH1C expression. d Overexpression of ADH1C significantly reduced tumor volume
  of xenograft CRC tumors. e Overexpression of ADH1C did not bring side effect on
  major organs of mice. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01.
