caption: GO enrichment analysis of the DEGs in four strains of C. geophilum after
  2 mg/L Cd treatment as compared to the same strains cultured in normal conditions
  (0 mg/L Cd). Y axis represents different regulatory pathway in the molecular function
  (blue), cellular component (yellow), and biological progress (purple) categories,
  respectively. X-axis represents the numbers of DEGs involved in the corresponding
  pathways.
