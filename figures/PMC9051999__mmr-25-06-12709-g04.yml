caption: 'GSK3β/β-catenin signaling activation reverses the effect of SERP1 overexpression
  on ERS and cell apoptosis. (A) Overexpression was verified by reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR and western blotting. ***P<0.001 vs. OE-NC; n≥3. (B) TCF/LEF activity was detected
  using a luciferase assay. (C) GSK3β/β-catenin expression was detected by western
  blotting. (D) Western blotting was applied to detect ERS-related protein expression.
  (E) A TUNEL assay was employed to detect cell apoptosis. (F) Apoptosis-related protein
  expression was detected by western blotting. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 vs. LPS;
  #P<0.05, ##P<0.01, ###P<0.001 vs. LPS + SERP1 + NC; n≥3. SERP1, stress-associated
  endoplasmic reticulum protein 1; ERS, endoplasmic reticulum stress; OE, overexpression;
  TCF, T-cell factor; LEF, lymphoid enhancing factor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NC,
  negative control.'
