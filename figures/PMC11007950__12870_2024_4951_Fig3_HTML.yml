caption: Analysis of antioxidant substances and anthocyanin synthesis structure gene
  expression levels in potato tubers and their correlation. (a) Effects of proper
  low-temperature treatment on the accumulation of antioxidant substances in Jianchuanhong
  tubers and Huaxinyangyu tubers. (b) Relative expression levels of structural genes
  involved in the anthocyanin synthesis pathway in two potato tubers. (c) Correlation
  analysis of physiological indexes and structural genes of potato tubers. Red represents
  a positive correlation, and blue represents a negative correlation. The data are
  the mean ± SD; n = 3; the larger the value, the more significant it is (P < 0.05)
