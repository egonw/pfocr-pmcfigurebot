caption: Pathway enrichment analysis of differentially regulated serum proteins in
  COVID-19 patients under Ruxo treatment. Wiki-Pathway enrichment analysis was performed
  on differentially regulated proteins (raw p-value < 0.05) as detected by MS on (A)
  day 1, (B) day 6 and (C) day 10. Heatmap-like plots indicate expression of individual
  genes involved in each pathway.
article_title: Serum proteomics hint at an early T-cell response and modulation of
  SARS-CoV-2-related pathogenic pathways in COVID-19-ARDS treated with Ruxolitinib.
