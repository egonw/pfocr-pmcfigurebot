caption: ADAR1 deficiency inhibits ovarian cancer cell proliferation, clonogenicity
  and invasion in vitro. (A) Protein levels of ADAR1 were determined in three ovarian
  cancer cell lines (SKOV3, A2780 and IGROV1) by Western blot. shA1 means shRNA 1
  targeting ADAR1; shA2 means shRNA 2 targeting ADAR1. (B) Cell growth curve of SKOV3,
  A2780 and IGROV1 with or without ADAR1 silence. All data were shown as mean ± SD
  from four independent experiments. (C) The representative microphotographs showed
  the colony formation of SKOV3, A2780 and IGROV1 cells with or without ADAR1 silence.
  (D) The number of colonies in (C) were shown in histograms. All data were shown
  as mean ± SD from three independent experiments (***, P < 0.001; **, P < 0.01; *,
  P < 0.05. (E) The representative microphotographs showed the migration of SKOV3,
  A2780 and IGROV1 cells with or without ADAR1 silence. The migrated cell numbers
  of (E) were shown in histograms. All data were shown as means ±SD from three independent
  experiments (***, P < 0.001; **, P < 0.01; *, P < 0.05).
