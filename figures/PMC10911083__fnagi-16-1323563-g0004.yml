caption: Fasudil affects mitochondrial proteins expression. Proteins showing a significant
  differential expression in the brain of PS19 mice compared to NC mice (A), PS19
  mice dosed with 30 mg/kg/day fasudil compared to vehicle-dosed mice (B), and PS19
  mice dosed with 100 mg/kg/day fasudil compared to vehicle-dosed mice (C). The significant
  proteins were obtained from the Reactome pathway for TCA cycle (R-MMU-148517, the
  citric acid cycle and respiratory electron transport) ranked among the top significantly
  enriched pathways in PS19 transgenic mice and after treatment with fasudil.
