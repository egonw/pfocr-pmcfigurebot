caption: 'A multiscale computational model simulates hepatic zonal induction of Cyp1A1
  by TCDD. (A) Zonal induction of Cyp1A1 in the mouse liver lobule by TCDD. The central‐to‐portal
  axis is segmented into nine zones following Halpern et al.(11) The area of the liver
  lobule expressing Cyp1a1 increases with increasing TCDD dose. (B) Schematic representation
  of the AHR and β‐catenin pathways and their intersection (made in BioRender [biorender.com]).
  (C) Intracellular model of the Wnt signaling pathway and downstream gene regulatory
  network for induction of Cyp1A1 by TCDD. (D) Multiscale virtual liver lobule model.
  The locations of the cells are calibrated from a single‐cell resolution image of
  the lobule in Halpern et al(11); the signaling pathway from (C) is implemented in
  each cell of the lobule model. The colors of the cells represent the expression
  level of Cyp1A1. Abbreviations: CV, central vein; and PV, portal vein.'
