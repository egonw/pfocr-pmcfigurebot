caption: 'OB Influence on CFA-Induced chronic pain. (A) Mechanical pain sensitivity
  and (B) thermal pain sensitivity were conducted at baseline and 26, 27, and 28 days
  after CFA injection. (C–G) The protein content of M1 microglial markers (CD86, iNOS),
  M2 microglial markers (Arg-1, IL-10) were measured by Western blot. The data obtained
  are represented as the means ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 vs the control group, #P<
  0.05, ##P < 0.01 vs CFA group, n = 5 per group.'
