figure_title: Computational design of CXCR4 associations with specific conformations
caption: 'a Mutations designed to selectively stabilize the CXCR4 open-dimer conformation
  without affecting CXCR4 monomer stability were identified in the extracellular and
  TMH regions. b Mutations designed to selectively stabilize the CXCR4 closed-dimer
  conformation without affecting CXCR4 monomer stability were identified in the extracellular
  region. Key atomic contacts are represented as red dotted lines. c Schematic conformational
  energy landscapes of CXCR4 dimerization in the inactive and active states for the
  open-dimer stabilizing designs. d Schematic conformational energy landscapes of
  CXCR4 dimerization in the inactive and active states for the closed-dimer stabilizing
  designs. c, d The dimerization energies reported in Supplementary Table  were used
  to plot the energy landscapes. The monomer energies and energy barriers between
  states are fictitious and were not predicted by our simulations. e Ranking of the
  CXCR4 variants based on changes in buried surface area upon dimerization (ΔSASA)
  calculated from the predicted models in the active state. The ΔSASA is reported
  for the most occupied dimer conformation for each variant: L194R open-dimer state,
  WT open-dimer state, N192W closed-dimer state, W195L closed-dimer state. Larger
  buried ΔSASA are predicted to correlate with enhanced dimerization propensity (see
  Supplementary Table ).'
