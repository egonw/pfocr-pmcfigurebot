caption: a Schematic diagram of PINK1/Parkin‐dependent mitophagy is responsible for
  apelin‐13‐induced human aortic VSMC proliferation and atherosclerotic lesions. b
  Schematic diagram of TXNIP-Redd1 expression is a novel signaling pathway that contributes
  to I/R injury by exaggerating excessive autophagy during reperfusion. c Schematic
  diagram of lactate-induced EndoMT after MI. d Schematic diagram depicting the proposed
  signaling mechanisms underlying the effects of CAND1 in the setting of cardiac hypertrophy.
