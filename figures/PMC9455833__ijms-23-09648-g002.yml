caption: A schematic diagram of the pathway of Faty acid-binding proteins (FABPs)
  involved in the ischemic injury of neurovascular units. FABP3 and FABP5 are overexpressed
  in ischemic neurons, mediate oxidative stress, and directly participate in ischemic
  neuronal death. FABP4 expressed in microglia stimulates the expression and release
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α), and matrix metalloproteinase
  MMP-9 activates extrinsic apoptotic signals in ischemic neurons and disrupts the
  blood–brain barrier (BBB). FABP7 enhances the pro-inflammatory expression of astrocytes
  and stimulates ischemic neuronal apoptosis through inflammation. The figure was
  created with BioRender.com.
