caption: Genome-wide loss-of-function genetic screen identifies endosomal sorting
  complexes required for transport (ESCRT) as major negative regulator of SLC20A1
  protein levels.A, flow cytometry–based analysis of SLC20A1 protein abundance in
  phosphate-replete (+Pi) and 48 h phosphate-starved (−Pi) HEK293T cells. B, workflow
  of CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic screen. Shade of green of immunostained cells denotes
  fluorescence level with darker cells displaying higher fluorescence (=higher SLC20A1
  protein levels). C, Manhattan plot of genetic screening results highlights loss-of-function
  guides of ESCRT subunits that are significantly enriched in the 0.5% brightest cells.
  D, WebGestalt-based analysis of genetic screening results displays pathways with
  enriched loss-of-function guides in the 0.5% brightest cells. False discovery rate
  was <0.05 for all displayed pathways. ∗Full pathway name is “Respiratory electron
  transport, ATP synthesis by chemiosmotic coupling, and heat production by uncoupling
  proteins.” Cas9, CRISPR-associated protein 9; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole;
  HEK293T, human embryonic kidney 293T cell; Puro, puromycin resistance cassette;
  sgRNA, single-guide RNA.
article_title: Cellular abundance of sodium phosphate cotransporter SLC20A1/PiT1 and
  phosphate uptake are controlled post-transcriptionally by ESCRT.
