caption: 'MYCL is highly expressed in TNBC. (A) TCGA dataset was used to analyze the
  expression of MYCL in cancer; MYCL was upregulated in BC. (B) TCGA analysis revealed
  MYCL was highly expressed in BC. (C) TCGA was used to analyze MYCL expression in
  diverse subtypes of BC; MYCL was highly expressed in TNBC. *P<0.05 vs. Normal; #P<0.05
  vs. Luminal; &P<0.05 vs. HER2 positive. (D) High levels of MYCL expression were
  related to poor overall survival of patients with TNBC. (E) High levels of MYCL
  expression was related to poor disease-free survival of patients with TNBC. (F)
  mRNA expression levels of MYCL in TNBC cell lines was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR. (G) Protein expression levels of MYCL in TNBC cell lines was detected by western
  blotting. *P<0.05 vs. MCF-10A. BC, breast cancer; HER2, human epidermal growth factor
  2; TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas; TNBC, triple-negative BC; MYCL, MYCL proto-oncogene.'
