caption: 'PF leaf extract inhibited the protein expression of pERK, pJNK and p-p38.
  (A) The expression levels of ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK proteins in lung tissue in each
  group; (B) Phosphorylated ERK quantitative analysis; (C) Phosphorylated JNK quantitative
  analysis; (D) Phosphorylated p38MAPK quantitative analysis. The values are expressed
  as the mean ± SD (n = 5 for per group, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 compared with the naïve
  group; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, versus the Model group).'
article_title: 'Network pharmacology and experimental evidence: MAPK signaling pathway
  is involved in the anti-asthma roles of Perilla frutescens leaf.'
