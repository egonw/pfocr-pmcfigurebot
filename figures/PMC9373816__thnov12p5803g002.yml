caption: Effect of Dex on BAT browning, thermogenic pathways and lipid metabolism.
  Immunoblot analysis on (A) UCP1 protein, transcriptional factors and cofactors for
  production of UCP1, and (B) the norepinephrine-stimulated cAMP-PKA signaling pathway
  under room temperature (RT) or cold challenge (Cold) for 6 h at P4. Each band represents
  a tissue extract from a single neonatal rat. Expression of (C) UCP1 and transcriptional
  factors/markers of BAT differentiation (n = 10-13) and (D) adipogenesis-related
  genes (n = 10-12) in the BAT of Dex-treated and Con neonatal rats. (E) Electron
  microscopic images and quantification of lipid droplet in the BAT of Dex-treated
  neonatal rats. The images were obtained at 1200× magnification. Scale bar = 10 μm.
  (F) Immunoblot analysis on lipolysis-related protein under RT and Cold. Expression
  of (G) BAT whitening-related genes (n = 10-13) and (H) fatty acid oxidation-related
  genes (n = 10-13). mRNA levels were expressed relative to average expression in
  the control rats. Data were expressed as mean ± SEM and statistics were calculated
  by Student's t-test in (C, D, E, G, and H). For quantification of immunoblot analysis,
  the intensities of bands quantified densitometrically relative to the control at
  RT were expressed as the bar graph with statistics analyzed by one-way ANOVA in
  (A, B, and F). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001.
