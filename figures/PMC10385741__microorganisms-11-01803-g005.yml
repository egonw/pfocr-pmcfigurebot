caption: Graphical summary of the microbial community associated with the sulfur cycle
  at the Porcelana hot spring. In the left panel, a dot plot was built using the gene
  counts of each sulfur pathway () for 8 different phyla and sulfur cycle steps. The
  size of the colored circle denotes abundance, and the color denotes the respective
  phylum. Temperature is shown on the Y-axis and sulfur cycle steps on the X-axis.
  The phylum names are written on the Y-axis, represented as a function of temperature
  and the sulfur cycle step where they appeared most relevant. The colored area denoting
  the most relevant Porcelana sulfur-associated bacteria (Pseudomonadota, Chloroflexota,
  and Cyanobacteriota) was hand-drawn behind the dots. In the central panel, concentrations
  of three sulfur species are shown based on field-measured concentrations (). In
  the right panel, the abundance level of photosynthesis-associated genes the of phyla
  Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexota, and Pseudomonadota. Temperature is shown on the Y-axis
  and concentration on the X-axis. * Based on data obtained from Alcam√°n-Arias et
  al. [].
