caption: The expression of α‐SMA and TGF‐β1 in human hepatic stellate cells (HSCs)
  after exposure to 50 mmHg pressure for 24 h with or without the addition of Y‐27632
  in medium. (A) Quantitative RT‐qPCR data on the fold change of mRNA expression levels
  (vs. 0 mmHg). (B) Representative images (upper) and semiquantitative data on the
  immunofluorescence staining intensity. Scale bars = 30 μm. (C) The protein expression
  by western blot analysis is also shown. Data are represented as mean ± SD from three
  independent experiments. P values were analyzed by one‐way ANOVA.
