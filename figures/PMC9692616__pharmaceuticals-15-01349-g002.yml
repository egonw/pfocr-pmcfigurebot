caption: 'Effects of the cumulative addition of S. samarangense extract doses (1–120
  g/mL) on isolated aortae from control rats that had been pre-constricted by phenylephrine
  (PE, 10 M). (A) typical tracing of S. samarangense extract’s dilation-inducing effects
  on PE-preconstricted aortae with healthy endothelium, (B) concentration response
  curve showing the vasodilating effect of S. samarangense extract on PE preconstricted
  aortae with intact endothelium compared with appropriate time controls, (C) an illustration
  of the effect of S. samarangense extract’s vasodilator on PE-precontracted aortae
  with denuded endothelium, and (D) concentration response curve showing the vasodilating
  effect of S. samarangense extract on PE preconstricted aortae with denuded endothelium
  compared with its vasodilating effect on PE pre-constricted aortae with the intact
  endothelium. The results are displayed as the mean ± standard error of six animals.
  In comparison to the time control values, * p ˂ 0.05; in comparison to the effect
  of the S. samarangense extract on intact endothelium values, # p ˂ 0.05.'
