caption: 'Activation of the stringent response and effects of (p)ppGpp on bacterial
  physiology. Long bifunctional RSHs are the main regulators of intracellular (p)ppGpp
  levels. The C-terminal is the part of the protein that senses metabolic conditions
  and transduces this information to the N-terminal catalytic domain, inducing it
  to adopt mutually exclusive conformations: when the synthesis site is properly formed,
  the hydrolysis is not, and vice versa. Accumulation of (p)ppGpp then modulates several
  pathways, via direct effects on enzyme targets and by reprogramming gene expression.
  We have highlighted the effects of (p)ppGpp that result in the shutdown of protein
  synthesis. They include the inhibition of translation factors and small GTPases
  involved in ribosome maturation, and a sharp reduction in rRNA and tRNA transcription.
  Another relevant effect not shown in the figure for simplicity is the expression
  of HPF, a protein that promotes ribosome dimerization (Irving et al. ). The combined
  result is a reduction in both the number or ribosomes per cell and in the rate of
  translation by these ribosomes'
