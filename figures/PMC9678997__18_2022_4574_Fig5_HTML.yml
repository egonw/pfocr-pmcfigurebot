caption: 'LRRK2 G2019S mutation-induced deregulation of the TH–DA pathway and DA neuron
  demise in human patient iPSc-derived DA neuron and hMLOs models. A–C G2019S LRRK2
  increases TH and DA levels in iPSc-derived DA neurons after 42 days induction and
  culture. A Representative Western blot data of TH levels in DA neurons. B Densitometric
  analysis of TH protein bands in Western blot gels in A. *P < 0.001, compared with
  arbitrary value of TH protein band of WT LRRK2 DA neurons, C HPLC analysis of DA
  content in DA neurons. *P < 0.05, compared with DA content in WT LRRK2 DA neurons.
  D–F Mutant G2019S LRRK2 increases TH and DA levels in iPSc-derived hMLOs after 60 days
  induction and culture. D Representative Western blot data of TH levels in hMLOs.
  E Densitometric analysis of TH protein bands in Western blot gels in D. *P < 0.001,
  compared with arbitrary value of TH protein bands of WT LRRK2 hMLOs. F HPLC analysis
  of DA content in hMLOs. *P < 0.05, compared with DA content of WT LRRK2 hMLOs. G
  and H Mutant G2019S LRRK2 leads to decreased TH level in longer time cultured hMLOs.
  G Western blot TH protein bands in hMLOs after induction and culture for 90 and
  127 days. H Densitometric analysis of TH bands in Western blot gels in G. *P < 0.001,
  compared with arbitrary value of TH bands of the respective WT or mutant G2019S
  LRRK2 hMLOs cultured for 90 days. #, at least P < 0.05, compared with arbitrary
  value of TH bands of WT LRRK2 hMLOs cultured for 90 or 127 days, respectively. I–K
  Mutant G2019S LRRK2 induces DA neurodegeneration in hMLOs. I and J Ratio of TH I
  or activated caspase 3- (J) positive cells against DAPI-stained cells. *, at least
  P < 0.005, compared with ratio of TH or activated caspase 3-positive cells against
  DAPI-stained cells of WT LRRK2 hMLOs. K Representative confocal image of TH, activated
  caspase 3 and DAPI-stained hMLOs (magnification: 400×)'
