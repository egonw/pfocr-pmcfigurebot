figure_title: HH-dependent and HH-independent Ptch1 expression revealed after HH pathway
  inhibition
caption: (A) X-Gal staining in Ptch1lacZ/+ mouse gavaged with Vehicle reveals expression
  in fungiform papilla (FP) basal, perigemmal and stromal cells and in a subset of
  filiform papillae (FILIF) cells. (A’) HHIP immunostaining (red) and TB cells (K8,
  green) in the same sections demonstrate HHIP expression in FILIF only (white arrow).
  (A’’) Merged images with Ptch1lacZ indicate overlap with HHIP in FILIF. (B-D) After
  Sonidegib treatment for HH pathway inhibition, X-Gal staining from Ptch1lacZ reporter
  demonstrates retained expression in FILIF while the expression in FP basal and perigemmal
  cells is lost. There is remaining Ptch1lacZ expression in FP apical basal layer
  (Atypical FP/TB, black arrows) and an ectopic expression in basal and suprabasal
  layers at a former TB-bearing location (Atypical FP/No TB, black arrows). (B’-D’)
  HHIP immunostaining (red) and TB cells (K8, green) in the same sections demonstrate
  ectopic HHIP expression at FP apex (yellow dotted lines). (B’’-D’’) Merged images
  of Ptch1lacZ, HHIP and K8 indicate partial co-expression pattern of Ptch1lacZ and
  HHIP (yellow dotted lines). Black/white dotted lines outline the base of the epithelium.
  Asterisks denote non-specific staining post X-Gal reactions. (E) Percentage of total
  FP with Typical and Ectopic Ptch1lacZ expression in Vehicle and after Sonidegib
  treatment. Statistical analysis is independent sample t-test. (*p<0.001). Numbers
  in parentheses are number of tongues analyzed.
