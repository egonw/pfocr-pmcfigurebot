caption: BDX-01 mitigated DSS-induced changes in gut microbiota composition. (A) α-diversity
  evaluated based on the Shannon index. (B) β-diversity assessed using PCoA based
  on weighted UniFrac distances. (C) Average relative species-level abundances of
  the gut microbiota of the four mouse groups. (D) Differential species-level abundances
  of bacterial OTUs in the BDX-01 and DSS groups. Only differentially abundant species
  are shown. Data represent the means ± SD (n = 5). *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p <
  0.001; ****p < 0.001 (one-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc test).
article_title: Bacteroides dorei BDX-01 alleviates DSS-induced experimental colitis
  in mice by regulating intestinal bile salt hydrolase activity and the FXR-NLRP3
  signaling pathway.
