caption: Human target validation and prioritization. After generation of CKD target
  lists, additional disease-relevant evidence is added to generate testable hypotheses
  and to prioritize the candidates. Tissue-specific expression enrichment and expression
  modulation in disease versus healthy states help to ascertain the role of targets
  in CKD. Correlation of targets with renal functional biomarkers and parameters is
  ascertained and target expression across CKD stages or etiologies is explored to
  add confidence around disease relevance. Prediction of target kidney cell type is
  useful for guiding downstream in vitro validation and assay selection. Pathway and
  network analyses can provide additional biological context for dysregulated cellular
  mechanisms and help infer potential mechanisms of action. The accumulated evidence
  supporting human target validation and mechanism of action results in a set of prioritized
  candidates for further experimental validation. CKD, chronic kidney disease; DN,
  diabetic nephropathy; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; eQTL, expression
  quantitative trait loci; FSGS, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis; HT, hypertensive
  nephropathy; IgA, immunoglobulin A nephropathy; MCD, minimal change disease; MGN,
  membranous glomerulonephritis; RPGN, rapid progressive glomerulonephritis; SLE,
  systemic lupus erythematosus.
