caption: 'A Genetic changes leading to high tryptophan production in E. coli BW25113
  background and schematic of the tryptophan overproduction strategy for strain sKR-Trp4,
  the highest producer of tryptophan from glucose generated in this study. The outer
  loop within the bottom schematic of (A) represents the genome and relevant genomic
  modifications, including deletions of TrpR and TnaA and the integration of a precursor
  module containing SerA(fbr) and AroG(fbr) within the rbsAR locus. Glucose 6-P: glucose-6-phosphate;
  PP Pathway: pentose phosphate pathway; PEP: phosphoenolpyruvate; E4P: erythrose-4-phosphate;
  DAHP: 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate; DHQ: 3-dehydroquinate; DHS:
  3-dehydroshikimate; S3P: shikimate-3-phosphate; EPSP: 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate;
  Ant: anthranilate; L-Trp: L-tryptophan; 3-PDG: 3-phospho-D-glycerate. B Tryptophan
  overproduction based on genetic modifications outlined in Table  and Supplementary
  Data . Each bar represents a biological triplicate for fermentations of 5 g/L glucose
  in minimal media after 24 h. Data are mean ± S.D.; n = 3 biological replicates.
