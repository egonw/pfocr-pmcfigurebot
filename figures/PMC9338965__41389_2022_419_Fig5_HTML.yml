figure_title: Distinct Treg subpopulations detected in pre-NACT and post-NACT tumors
caption: a UMAP plots showing the subtypes of T/NK cells, labeled in different colors.
  Subtype annotations are indicated in the Figure. b Violin plots showing selected
  marker genes in distinct T/NK cell subtypes. c UMAP plots showing the subtypes of
  CD4+ T cells from pre-NACT and post-NACT tumors. Each subcluster is color-coded.
  Subtype annotations are indicated in the Figure. d Heatmap depicting marker gene
  enrichment for each cell subtype of CD4+ T cells. e UMAP plots showing the color-coded
  cell groups of CD4+ T cells in response to NACT. f UMAP plots showing four main
  cell subtypes of Tregs, labeled in different colors. g Dot plots showing the expression
  levels of specific genes in each Treg subtype. h Metabolic pathway analysis showing
  the enrichment of Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis and the citrate cycle in each Treg
  subtype. i KEGG pathway analysis showing the primary enriched pathways of IL2RAhi-CCL22+-Treg
  cells. j Cell communication analysis showing the overlapping relationship between
  specific pre-NACT and post-NACT tumor samples.
