caption: The effect of IPO7 on the development of PC in vivo. PANC-1 cells with IPO7
  knockdown or the control PANC-1 cells were inoculated into the mice via subcutaneous
  injection or tail vein. (A) Tumor volumes were decreased in the IPO7-siRNA group.
  (B) Tumor weight were decreased in the IPO7-siRNA group. (C) qRT-PCR showed that
  IPO7 mRNA and ERBB mRNA expression levels were decreased in the tumor tissue of
  the mice in IPO7 knockdown group. (D) The lung metastasis of the mice was ameliorated
  in IPO7 knockdown group, and HE staining was utilized to evaluated the histopathological
  changes of the lung of the mice (*p < 0.05).
