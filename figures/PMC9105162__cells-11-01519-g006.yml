caption: SPB association of OpTem1 and OpMob1 is cell cycle dependent. (a) Time-lapse
  microscopy of OpTEM1-GFP OpMPS3-mRFP cells (HPH1771). Images were taken every 1
  min. The RFP image was only captured before the start of the time-lapse series.
  Anaphase onset was around the 12 min timepoint. The dSPB was inserted into the bud
  at the 15 min timepoint. Yellow arrows indicate SPBs. Scale bar, 2 µm. (b) Time-lapse
  microscopy of OpMOB1-GFP OpMPS3-mRFP cells (HPH2108). Images were taken every 1
  min. The RFP image was only captured at the first timepoint. The cell entered into
  anaphase before the 7 min timepoint. The dSPB was first detected at the 17 min timepoint.
  Yellow arrows indicate SPBs. Scale bar, 2 µm. (c) Duration time of Mob1-GFP at the
  mSPB and dSPB was measured in the time-lapse experiment in (b). N = 16. Statistical
  significance was determined by the t-test. (d) Time-lapse microscopy of OpCDC14-GFP
  cells (HPH1479). Images were taken every 2 min. The cell entered into anaphase shortly
  before the 2 min timepoint. The anaphase nucleus was inserted into the bud before
  the 6 min timepoint. Scale bar, 2 µm.
