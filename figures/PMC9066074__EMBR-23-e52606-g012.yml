figure_title: CEST‐2.2 overexpression induces transcriptional changes in gas‐1 mutant
  nematodes
caption: 'Representative image of 5‐day‐old cest‐2.2p::GFP (left panel) and an age‐matched
  GFP‐negative control (right panel). Scale bar = 100 μm.Schematic representation
  of CEST‐2.2 participation in very long‐chain fatty acid (VLCFA) metabolism and ascaroside
  biosynthesis. Metabolites from peroxisomal β‐oxidation may contribute to the biosynthesis
  of medium‐chain fatty acid (1) and intracellular signaling (2). Ascarosides may
  take part in cell‐autonomous and/or cell‐nonautonomous signaling.Confocal images
  of mitochondrial morphology in the intestines of gas‐1(fc21) animals exposed to
  either 1.7% ethanol (control), 1 μM ascr#8 or 1 μM ascr#81 (scale bar= 5 μm).Representative
  lifespan analysis of gas‐1(fc21) animals exposed to ethanol (control) and 1 μM ascr#8
  from hatching. Underneath is the average median lifespan ± SEM across replicates.qRT‐PCR
  of cest‐2.2 expression in the intestines of 5‐day‐old wt, gas‐1(fc21), gas‐1(fc21);
  cest‐2.2 O/E and nuo‐6(qm200) animals (one‐way ANOVA with the Tukey’s multiple comparison
  test, n = 3 biological replicates).Volcano plot of transcriptomes of intestines
  from gas‐1(fc21) versus wt (left panel) and gas‐1(fc21); cest‐2.2 O/E versus gas‐1(fc21)
  mutants (right panel). In red: significantly dysregulated genes (5% FDR).Pie charts
  of differentially regulated genes in gas‐1(fc21) versus wt (top panel) and gas‐1(fc21);
  cest‐2.2 O/E versus gas‐1(fc21) mutants (bottom panel), showing proportion of genes
  of unknown function or involved in metabolism. Genes involved in lipid metabolism
  specifically represented in a small box within the metabolism slice.Heatmap of genes
  involved in lipid metabolism in gas‐1(fc21) versus wt and gas‐1(fc21); cest‐2.2
  O/E versus gas‐1(fc21).Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) of transcriptome in gas‐1(fc21)
  versus wt (top panel) and gas‐1(fc21); cest‐2.2 O/E versus gas‐1(fc21) (bottom panel)
  with their predicted consequences on lipid metabolism. In red/green: results from
  the transcriptome. In blue/orange: IPA‐generated predicted outcome of this gene
  dysregulation. Shades of red and green are proportional to log2(fold change), while
  shades of blue and orange are proportional to the statistical strength of the prediction
  (z‐score), as calculated by IPA. Data information: In D, the median lifespan ± SEM
  is reported underneath the graphs and additional information (e.g., n numbers) are
  reported in Appendix Table ; in E, points represent mean ± SEM. Across experiments,
  P‐value summary is ns = not significant, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.'
