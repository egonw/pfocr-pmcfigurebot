caption: TOF inhibits activation of microglia-induced neuronal apoptosis in vitro.
  (A) The morphology of primary neurons after co-culture with active microglia. (B-C)
  Flow cytometry analysis of primary neuron apoptosis in each group. Histogram showing
  the calculated percentage of apoptotic cell marked with Annexin V+ (The values are
  presented as mean ± SD; ***p<0.001, one-way ANOVA; data are combined from 3 independent
  experiments). (D) Western blot analysis and quantification of cleaved-caspase3,
  Bcl-2 and Bax expression in primary neurons (The values are presented as mean ±
  SD; * p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, one-way ANOVA; data are combined from 3 independent
  experiments).
