figure_title: Single-cell RNA sequencing of human AML bone marrow samples supports
  porphyrin overdrive as a hallmark of cancer cells
caption: Single-cell transcriptomes were obtained from bone marrow biopsies of AML
  donors with over 60% blasts. (A) Single-cell population composition shows only a
  minor fraction of the cells are cancer progenitors, which are defined by transcriptome
  embedding and clustering analysis. (B) Identification of distinct single-cell populations
  in the AML patient bone marrow samples by t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor
  embedding) analysis. A total of 1,349 high-quality transcriptomes from patient biopsies
  were used. (C) Representative genes for proteins associated with heme metabolism,
  normal early erythroid development, cell proliferation, and erythroid commitment
  process are plotted. (D) UROD, the gene encoding the fifth enzyme of the heme biosynthetic
  pathway, is highly expressed in cancer early progenitors. HMS and UROS, which encode
  other intermediate step-catalyzing enzymes, are also overexpressed in cancer progenitors.
  (E) Marker genes delineate cell populations from the patient samples. Note the complementary
  expression patterns of ALAS1 versus ALAS2. (F) Solid tumor single-cell RNAseq shows
  the overexpression of the genes for the enzymes responsible for the intermediate
  heme biosynthetic pathway steps in breast cancer and melanoma (; ).
