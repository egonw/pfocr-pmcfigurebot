caption: 'Pathway analysis: The differentially expressed genes (DEGs, 25,000) from
  wild type, Sirt3-/-, APP/PS1 and APP/PS1/Sirt3-/- mouse brain samples were uploaded
  into the DAVID database (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) for KEGG-GO pathway enrichment
  analysis in APP/PS1/Sirt3-/- (comorbid-AD) mice. Enrichment analysis of KEGG revealed
  that DEGs were primarily involved in metabolic, inflammation, Alzheimer disease (AD)
  and insulin signaling pathways. A representative AD cascade pathway was obtained
  from KEGG Pathway Maps. For the functional annotation of differentially expressed
  genes, the web-based DAVID Bioinformatics Resources v 6.8 tool was used (https://david.ncifcrf.gov).'
