caption: Sophisticated osteoclast regulatory network in physiological and aging condition.
  The osteoclasogenesis is governed by numerous signaling pathways. The binding of
  RANKL to RANK facilitates the recruitment of TRAF6, which then triggers various
  downstream signaling pathways, including NF‐κB, MAPK, PI3K‐AKT, and the calcium
  signaling pathway. These pathways, in turn, influence transcription factors like
  NFATc1 and AP‐1, subsequently promoting the expression of genes related to osteoclastogenesis.
  AP1, activator protein‐1; IKKα, inhibitor of NF‐κB kinase subunit α; IKKβ, inhibitor
  of NF‐κB kinase subunit β; ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine‐based activation motif;
  MAPK, mitogen‐activated protein kinases; NEMO, NF‐κB essential modulator; NFATc1,
  nuclear factor of activated T cells 1; NF‐κB, nuclear factor kappa B; NIK, NF‐κB‐inducing
  kinase; OPG, osteoprotegerin; P2XR, purinergic ionotropic receptor; PI3K, phosphoinositide
  3‐kinase; RANK, receptor activation of NF‐κB; RANKL, receptor activation of NF‐κB
  ligand; RyR, ryanodine receptor; SASP, senescence‐associated secretory phenotype;
  SERCA, Sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase; TLR, toll‐like receptor; TRAF3,
  tumor necrosis factor receptor‐associated factor 3; TRAF6, tumor necrosis factor
  receptor‐associated factor 6; TRPC, transient receptor potential channel; VGCC,
  voltage‐gated Ca2+ channel.
