caption: The effect of CORM-3 on TSCC cell migration and invasion. (a, b) The effect
  of CORM-3 on the migration of CAL27 and SCC4 cells was tested using scratch assay
  (magnification, ×40). Statistical analysis of the healing distance showed that CORM-3
  treatment could migrate at a lower rate than that in control group and iCORM-3 group.
  (c, d) The effect of CORM-3 on the invasion of CAL27 cells and SCC4 was tested by
  transwell assay (magnification, ×200). Cell numbers that invaded the lower membrane
  surface were less in CORM-3 stimulation groups than in the control group and iCORM-3
  group. (e, f) Epithelial mesenchymal transition is involved in the CAL27 and SCC4
  cells by CORM-3. CAL27 and SCC4cells were treated with CORM-3 for 0, 0.25, 0.5,
  1, 3, 6, and 12 h; the protein expression of E-cadherin and N-cadherin was assessed
  by western blotting. Relative protein level was normalized to the corresponding
  GAPDH protein expression. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. the control
  group, respectively.
