figure_title: HOXA5 overexpression attenuates the malignant behaviors of ECCA cells
caption: A, B RT-qPCR and Western blot analyses validated HOXA5 overexpression, which
  reduced the mitosis-related gene expression in ECCA cells. HOXA5 overexpression
  did not alter the EMT-related gene expression, but increased AIFM1, and decreased
  BCL-2 expression in ECCA cells. C HOXA5 overexpression induced cell cycle arrest
  in G1/G0 phase. D, E HOXA5 overexpression inhibited the proliferation of ECCA cells.
  F HOXA5 overexpression decreased the tumor volumes in mice. G Immunohistochemistry
  analysis of HOXA5 and Ki67 expression in xenograft tumors from nude mice. Data are
  representative images from three separate experiments. *P < 0.05. **P < 0.01. ***P < 0.001.
  Orange bar, 50 μm. Green bar, 20 μm.
