caption: OTSSP167 restored the up‐regulation effect of the MELK plasmid. (A) The expression
  of MELK was up‐regulated at transcription level with MELK plasmid; it was down‐regulated
  by OTSSP167. OTSSP167 could restore the up‐regulation effect caused by transfection
  with the MELK plasmid. (B–D) Cellular functional studies, MTT (B), clonogenic forming
  (C) and migration (D) assays confirmed the restoration function of OTSSP167. E,
  OTSSP167 restored the cell cycle effect caused by transfection with the MELK plasmid.
  (F) OTSSP167 restored the inhibition effect of the ATM/CHK2/p53 pathway, which was
  caused transfection with the MELK plasmid, *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001
