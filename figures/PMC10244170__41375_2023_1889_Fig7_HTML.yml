figure_title: Clinical effect of pevonedistat in NHL patients
caption: PBMC were collected at baseline and 3 and 24 h post-pevonedistat infusion.
  For cytokine staining, equal numbers of human PBMC cells were cultured in vitro
  for 5 h in the presence of PMA, ionomycin and BFA. A IFN-γ B CTLA-4 and PD-1 and
  C TNFα, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-17 expression was quantified in CD4+ or CD8+ T cells by
  flow cytometry. Data are mean ± SEM, *p < 0.05. D UMAP (uniform manifold approximation
  and projection) visualization of all cells colored by cell type. E GSEA (gene set
  enrichment analysis) plots illustrating the significant enrichment of hallmark IFN-α
  and IFN-γ response pathways in 24 h post infusion versus baseline in the indicated
  cell types. The green line represented the enrichment of pathway in the 24 h post
  infusion group or control baseline group according to gene expression levels, with
  genes enriched in the 24 h post infusion group shown on the left and genes enriched
  in the control baseline group shown on the right. NES normalized enrichment score.
