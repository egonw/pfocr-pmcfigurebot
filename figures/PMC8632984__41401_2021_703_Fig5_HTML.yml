figure_title: RNA-seq analysis of mouse cardiac tissues
caption: C57BL/6J mice received darapladib (50 mg·kg−1·d−1) or vehicle by gavage and
  were infused with saline or Ang II (1500 ng·kg−1·min−1) for 7 days. Hearts were
  collected for RNA-seq analysis. a Heatmap of differentially expressed genes that
  were both significantly changed in Ang II (compared to saline) and darapladib+Ang
  II (compared to Ang II) groups. Each column represents an individual replicate,
  with three replicates per group. Each row represents an individual gene. The top
  of the heatmap is the cluster of genes that are upregulated in Ang II-infused hearts
  compared with saline-infused hearts and those that are downregulated in darpladib + Ang
  II hearts, whereas the bottom is the cluster of genes that are downregulated in
  Ang II-infused hearts compared with saline-infused hearts and those that are upregulated
  in darapladib + Ang II hearts. The color bar represents the relative gene expression
  of log-transformed and normalized fragments per kilobase of transcript per million
  mapped reads (FPKM). Upregulated genes are shown in red, and downregulated genes
  are shown in blue. b Volcano plot shows the fold change and the significance of
  genes that were altered in darapladib+Ang II hearts vs. Ang II hearts. Upregulated
  genes are plotted in red, downregulated genes are plotted in blue, and genes not
  significant are plotted in gray. GO analysis of biological processes for the genes
  upregulated in the Ang II group compared with the saline group (c), and the genes
  downregulated in the darapladib+Ang II group compared with the Ang II group (d).
  Significantly changed ontology terms are mainly involved in inflammation, proliferation,
  fibrosis, and several fibrotic signaling pathways (c, d). KEGG pathway analysis
  of upregulated genes in the Ang II group compared with the saline group (e) and
  downregulated genes in the darapladib + Ang II group compared with the Ang II group
  (f). Significantly changed signaling pathways are mainly involved in inflammation,
  proliferation, and fibrosis (e, f). NS indicates not significant. P adj < 0.05 is
  considered to be different.
