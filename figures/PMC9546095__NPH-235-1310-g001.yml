caption: '(a) Oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP) in chloroplasts carrying
  anaplerotic flux into the Calvin–Benson cycle (grey). Enzyme reactions that introduce
  deuterium (D) fractionation signals at starch glucose H1 and H2 are indicated in
  blue and green, respectively. Dashed arrows, intermediate reactions not shown. The
  cytosolic oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (not shown) starts from TP that was
  exported to the cytosol by the triose phosphate translocator (Fliege et al., ).
  Synthesized pentose phosphate is reimported into chloroplasts by the pentose phosphate
  translocator (Eicks et al., ). Enzymes: G6PD, glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase;
  PGI, phosphoglucose isomerase. Metabolites: 3PGA, 3‐phosphoglycerate; 6PG, 6‐phosphogluconate;
  6PGL, 6‐phosphogluconolactone; F6P, fructose 6‐phosphate; G6P, glucose 6‐phosphate;
  NADPH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; Ru5P, ribulose 5‐phosphate;
  RuBP, ribulose 1,5‐bisphosphate; TP, triose phosphates (glyceraldehyde 3‐phosphate,
  dihydroxyacetone phosphate). Modified figure from Wieloch et al. (). (b, c) D abundance
  at glucose H1 (blue bars) and H2 (green bars) of sunflower leaf starch. Asterisks
  denote D abundances that are significantly greater than zero (one‐tailed one‐sample
  t‐test: P < 0.05, n = 5). The plants were raised in chambers over 7–8 wk at an atmospheric
  CO2 concentration (C a) of 450 ppm. After a day in darkness to drain the starch
  reserves, the plants were grown for 2 d at different levels of C a (450, 700, 1500 ppm)
  corresponding to different levels of intercellular CO2 concentration (328, 531,
  1365 ppm). Data expressed as δD1 = D1/D6S − 1 and δD2 = D2/D6R – 1, where Di  denotes
  relative D abundances at specific carbon‐bound hydrogen atoms of glucose. D abundances
  at glucose H6S and H6R are used as references because glucose H1 and H6S and H2
  and H6R have the same precursors at the chloroplast triose‐phosphate level, and
  H6S and H6R are not modified in the starch biosynthesis pathway (Wieloch et al., ).'
