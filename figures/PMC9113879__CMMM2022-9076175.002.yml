caption: Annotation and enrichment of 26 identified genes. GO analysis showed that
  the genes were involved in metabolisms of sterol, monocarboxylic acid, fatty acid,
  cholesterol, and bile acid and in transports of lipid, organic anion, and bile acid
  (a). KEGG analysis showed that most of the genes contributed to the ABC transporter
  family and were involved in the PPAR signaling pathway and syntheses of bile acid,
  cholesterol, and fatty acids (b).
