caption: CanineCV and Rep inhibit IFN-I and ISG expression. F81 cells were transfected
  with different plasmids, total RNA was extracted from the cells at the indicated
  time points, and the mRNA levels of IFN-α, IFN-β (A,E), MxA and ISG15 (B,F) were
  measured by qPCR. In the dual luciferase assay, F81 cells were transfected with
  different plasmids for 24 h, inoculated with SeV and incubated for another 12 h,
  and lysed for determination of luciferase activity (C,D,G–I). CanineCV and the Rep
  protein inhibited SeV-activated IFN-α, IFN-β, MxA, and ISG15 expression at the mRNA
  level. Second, the results of the dual luciferase assay showed that CanineCV and
  the Rep protein blocked the activation of the IFN-β and ISRE promoters. Finally,
  the Rep protein blocked the interferon signaling pathway through the IRF3 and NFκB
  pathways. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001 compared with
  the empty vector transfection group.
