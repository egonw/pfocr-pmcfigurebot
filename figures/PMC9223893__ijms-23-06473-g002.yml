caption: 'A higher RvD score is associated with more favorable outcomes in HNSC. (A)
  Heatmap of individual genes involved in SPM production in HNSC patients. mRNA expression
  z-scores relative to diploid samples (RNA Seq V2 RSEM) are shown. Patients are reported
  in columns, genes in rows. Blue: lower expression; red: higher expression. Color
  code is reported at the bottom of the panel. (B) Association between individual
  SPM genes and overall survival in multiple TCGA datasets. The heatmap (TIMER 2.0,
  Gene_Outcome mode) shows the normalized coefficient (z-score) of association between
  individual gene expression and overall survival (red: inverse association; blue:
  direct association) adjusted for age, gender, stage and purity. A red rectangle
  highlights HNSC cancers. Filled squares indicate significant (p < 0.05) associations
  predicted in multiple cancer types. TCGA study abbreviations were reported according
  to the NCI genomic data commons. (C) Kaplan–Meier curve survival analysis of HNSC
  patients stratified for high (n = 100) or low (n = 100) RvD score. Logrank test
  p-value and median months progression free are reported. (D) RvD score in HNSC from
  TCGA datasets in tumor-free alive or dead patients (n = 362) vs. patients’ death
  with symptoms of cancer (n = 128). Clinical data were extracted from the TCGA HNSC
  database using the cBioportal software. ** p < 0.01, Student t test. (E) Lipoxin
  score in HNSC from TCGA datasets in tumor-free alive or dead patients (n = 362)
  vs. patients dead with tumors (n = 128). Clinical data were extracted from the TCGA
  HNSC database using the cBioportal software. p = ns, Student t test.'
