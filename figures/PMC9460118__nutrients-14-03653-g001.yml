caption: 'Different ratios of carbohydrate–fat have different effects on metabolic
  patterns. (A) Representative 600 MHz 1H NMR spectra of plasma (10% group). The 1H−NMR
  signals identified were: 1. lipid, 2. isoleucine, 3. leucine, 4. valine, 5. isobutyrate,
  6. 3−hydroxybutyrate, 7. lactate, 8. lysine, 9. alanine, 10. arginine, 11. acetate,
  12. n−acetylated glycoproteins (NAG), 13. O−acetylated glycoproteins (OAG), 14.
  acetoacetate, 15. pyruvate, 16. glutamine, 17. succinate, 18. dimethylamine, 19.
  dimethylglycine, 20. creatinine, 21. phenylalanine, 22. choline, 23. trimethylamine
  N−oxide (TMAO), 24. phosphocholine, 25. α−glucose, 26. betaine, 27. glycine, 28.
  oxalic acid, 29. glycerol, and 30. triglycerides. (B) OPLS score plots of plasma
  1H NMR spectra from different fat formulation groups with fat percentage as the
  Y-matrix (R2 X = 0.827, R2 Y = 0.995, Q2 = 0.759). The X−axis indicates the score
  of the main component of the OSC process, and the Y-axis indicates the score of
  the orthogonal component of the OSC process. (C) OPLS scatter plot from the plasma
  of the statistical validations obtained by 200 times permutation tests, with R2
  and Q2 values in the vertical axis, the correlation coefficients (between the permuted
  and true class) in the horizontal axis, and the OLS line representing the regression
  of R2 and Q2 on the correlation coefficients (R2 = (0.0, 0.976), Q2 = (0.0, −1.04)).
  (D) S−plot curve of the OPLS model. The X−axis indicates the covariance coefficients
  of the principal components and metabolites, and the Y−axis indicates the correlation
  coefficients of the principal components and metabolites. The coloured dots are
  the chemical shifts of the metabolites. (E) Heat map of the identified biomarkers
  of each group obtained from hierarchical clustering analysis by using Ward’s minimum
  variance method and Euclidean distance. The concentration of each metabolite is
  colored based on a normalized scale from minimum −1.5 (dark blue) to maximum 2.5
  (dark red) (excluding the sample in the 20% group that was outside the 95% confidence
  interval in (B), n = 6 in the other groups). (F) Metabolomic view map of important
  metabolic pathways. The X-axis represents pathway impact, and the Y-axis represents
  the pathway enrichment.'
