caption: Glutathione metabolism pathway showing co-expressed genes, proteins and metabolites
  in drought-tolerant (DT) and drought-sensitive (DS) chickpea genotypes under control
  (C) and drought (D) conditions. Co-expressed genes, proteins and metabolites are
  shown by orange, green and blue colored boxes, respectively. Up- (*) and down-regulated
  (**) genes, proteins and metabolites are marked. GSH- Glutathione reduced; GSSG-
  Glutathione oxidized.
