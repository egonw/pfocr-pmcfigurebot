caption: The visualization of the top three significant harmonic wavelets associated
  with amyloid-PET in CN/EMCI (left), EMCI/LMCI (middle), and CN/LMCI (right) comparison.
  The underlying center node of the harmonic wavelet is denoted with a red dot. The
  up/down oscillation pattern in each wavelet is displayed by red/blue arrows.
