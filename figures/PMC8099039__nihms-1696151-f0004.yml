caption: MRI of the optic nerve. (a,b) Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps of
  a patient with multiple sclerosis-optic neuritis of the right optic nerve (a) and
  a patient with AQP4-IgG positive neuromyelitis optica-optic neuritis of the left
  optic nerve (b). Mean group ADC in the study was significantly lower in neuromyelitis
  optica-optic neuritis than in multiple sclerosis-optic neuritis. (c) Visual pathway
  fiber bundle tracking showing significantly lower nerve fiber bundle density in
  the optic nerve affected by indirect traumatic optic neuropathy (right) than in
  the normal nerve (left). (d) Fractional anisotropy (FA) map demonstrating significantly
  lower FA values in an optic nerve affected by advanced glaucoma (right) compared
  to the optic nerve with mild glaucoma (left). (e) Preoperative T1-weighted MRI showing
  a left optic glioma. Adapted with permissions from Refs. , , , .
