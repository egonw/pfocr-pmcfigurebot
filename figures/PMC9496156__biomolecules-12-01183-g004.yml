caption: GO and KEGG enrichment analyses of KRT17-correlated genes in BC tissues from
  the TCGA-BRCA datasets. GO enrichment analysis identified the BP, CC and MF terms
  enriched by the genes coexpressed with KRT17 in HER2high (A) and ERhigh (C) BC.
  KEGG pathway analysis of co-genes coexpressed with KRT17 in the HER2high (B) and
  ERhigh (D) BC cohorts.
