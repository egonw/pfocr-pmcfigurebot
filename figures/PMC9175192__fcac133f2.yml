caption: BX795 (an inhibitor of TBK1, a component of the STING pathway) inhibits STING
  agonist-mediated upregulation of Ifit1 and is correlated with the abrogation of
  neuroprotection with a STING agonist. (A) qPCR analysis of Ifit1 gene expression
  with 50 µM DMXAA and different doses of BX795 for 2 and 4 h. The statistical analysis
  was performed using Two-way ANOVA with Šídák’s multiple comparisons test. Data are
  expressed as mean ± SD (n = 3). ****P < 0.0001 compared with the control group.
  (B) Representative live images of STING agonists preconditioning, followed by 3.5 h
  of OGD condition, followed by 24 h reperfusion in mature neurons with 50 µM DMXAA
  and BX795 (1 µM). (C) Image quantification using ImageJ software of 50 µM DMXAA
  and 1 µM BX795. Each data point represents an independent set of experiment.
