caption: CD44+/CD24− represents a CSC population and can be modulated by the mTOR
  pathway. (A,B) CD44+/CD24− population forms more organoids compared to CD44+/CD24+
  or CD44−/CD24− populations and are more radiation-resistant upon 2 Gy radiation.
  Scale bar = 100 µm. (C) Both CD44+/CD24− and CD44+/CD24+ -sorted cells treated with
  Torin-1 (10 nM, 14 days) showed an increased CD44+/CD24− phenotype compared to DMSO
  controls whereas the same sorted populations show a more pronounced decrease in
  CD44+/CD24− cells with MHY1485 (1 µM, 14 days). (D) Schematic representation of
  the role of mTOR in esophageal cancer stemness through autophagy. Error bars indicate
  SD. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001 by two-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey–Kramer
  post hoc test.
