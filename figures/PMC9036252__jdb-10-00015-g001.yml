caption: Overview of BMP signalling cascades. BMP homodimers and heterodimers signal
  through a heterotetrameric complex of serine/threonine kinase BMP type I and type
  II receptors. In the induced heterotetrameric complex, BMPR type II phosphorylates
  the GS-domain of BMPR type I to induce canonical and noncanonical BMP signalling
  pathways. In the canonical pathway, type I receptors phosphorylate Smads 1, 5, or
  8 (R-Smad), which form a heteromeric complex with Smad 4, and then translocate to
  the nucleus. In the nucleus, this complex forms a complex with Runx2 to regulate
  osteogenic gene expression. The noncanonical signalling cascade, p38 mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK), is initiated by TAK1 phosphorylation, which recruits TAB1
  and induces the MKK-P38 MAPK signalling pathway. The phosphorylated form of p38
  phosphorylates and activates Runx2, Dlx5, and Sp7 transcription factors in the nucleus
  to initiate the transcription of osteogenic genes. Furthermore, phosphorylated Runx2
  promotes the formation of the Smad–Runx2 complex. “Created with BioRender.com (Accessed
