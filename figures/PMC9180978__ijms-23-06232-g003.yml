caption: 'Some potential mechanisms related to effects of the cytochrome P450-soluble
  epoxide hydrolase (CYP450-sEH) pathway. The vascular endothelial cells release EpETrEs
  onto the vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to vasodilation. Cell stressors including
  shear stress, inflammation, metabolic stress, and angiotensin, can interrupt this
  process; they can exacerbate ER stress in endothelial cells, leading to endothelial
  dysfunction and vessel inflammation [,]. Laminar flow has an anti-inflammatory effect
  involving PPARg signaling, which is disrupted by shear stress []. Shear stress and
  angiotensin II increase sEH expression [,]. Inhibition of sEH attenuates ER stress
  by an unknown mechanism that may involve elevated epoxides and/or decreased diols,
  which attenuates production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and membrane
  permeability [,,,,]. By reducing NFkB-dependent TNF signaling [], epoxides may reduce
  the expression of NOX4, which would generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the
  ER, and reduce the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components, which would exacerbate
  inflammation []. The mitochondria can be activated by Ca2+ from the ER, generating
  ROS that activate the inflammasome. Mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to programmed
  cell death, which can be exacerbated by Bax expression due to ER stress []. Therefore,
  the epoxides and/or diols, and sEH inhibitors, may affect cross-talk between the
  ER, mitochondria and NLRP3 inflammasome, attenuating inflammation, apoptosis, and
  the effects of oxidative stress [,,]. Abbreviations: EpETrE, epoxyeicosatrienoic
