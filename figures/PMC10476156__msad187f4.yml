caption: 'Specific reactions and metabolites govern the effects of mutations on resource
  hierarchies. (A) The locations of evolutionary modifiers and sensitive metabolites
  to the modifiers in a metabolic network. Here, we mapped them on the central carbon
  metabolic pathways, that is PPP, glycolysis, glycine/serine/threonine pathway, and
  TCA cycle, where many of those are involved. Metabolites that were more strongly
  affected by capacitors or potentiators are colored by red and blue, respectively.
  (B) and (C) Comparison of magnitude of flux between modifiers and nonmodifiers.
  We randomly picked out 1,000 evolved models and calculated the average flux carried
  by 43 reactions screened as modifiers (purple) and randomly chosen 1,000 nonmodifier
  reactions (gray) across 7 sugars (7301 reaction-sugar pairs). Among those, we selected
  the pairs working as modifiers (marked with asterisks in , N = 107) and compared
  them with other pairs (nonmodifier pairs, N = 7,194). Comparison of mean value and
  statistical significance level were indicated (Wilcoxon rank-sum test). (D) A schematic
  of “flux sensitivity” analysis. For randomly picked 1,000 evolved models, we added
  or deleted the target reaction R depending on whether it exists or not. Then, we
  calculated the cosine similarity of the total flux distribution between presence
  (JR+) or absence (JR−) of the reaction (θR). Similarly to (B) and (C), we calculated
  θR of 43 modifiers and 1000 nonmodifiers for each of 7 sugars, and θR is used as
  the proxy for flux sensitivity for the reaction R on each sugar. (E) Comparison
  of flux sensitivity (θR) among nonmodifiers (non C-P) or modifiers (C-P). Among
  7,301 reaction-sugar pairs, we selected the pairs exhibiting statistically significant
  effects (marked with asterisks in ). Then, we checked whether θR is significantly
  larger in modifiers than nonmodifiers (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P-value is shown
  in the panel). (F) A schematic of flux sensitivity analysis for metabolites. For
  each metabolite m, influx and efflux to m were analyzed before and after a deletion
  or addition of a reaction of interest R. Then, cosine similarity between JR+,m,
  and JR−,m was calculated (φR,m). By comparing φR,m, we screened the metabolites
  that are significantly more sensitive to the modifiers. (G) Typical metabolites
  whose flux is sensitive to modifiers. We categorized the screened metabolites, which
  are sensitive to either capacitors or potentiators ( and  online) into four groups:
  central carbon metabolism (green), currency metabolites (red), glycine/serine/threonine
  metabolism (blue), and others (gray) and shown its ratio as a pie chart (left pie
  chart). We also showed the number of metabolites that are more sensitive to capacitors
  (middle pie chart) or potentiators (right pie chart) in each category.'
