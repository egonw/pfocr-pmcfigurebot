caption: A model of GMV-elicited LDR in the rol1 mutants. Chloroplastic lipid biosynthesis,
  which consumes ROL1-dependent 18 : 1, is critical for both GMV-triggered growth
  promotion and LDR in Arabidopsis. With sufficient 18 : 1, GMV-exposed plants enhance
  chloroplastic lipid production in supporting bacteria-triggered growth promotion.
  With deficient 18 : 1, the attempts to enhance chloroplastic lipid production would
  exacerbate 18 : 1 deficiency, making the association unfavorable for the plant.
  In rol1 mutant plants, the unwelcomed association is perceived through GMV-triggered
  H2O2 over accumulation, which can drive the oxidation of MGDG and DGDG in priming
  an SA-dependent defense and increase 18 : 1 consumption in the prokaryotic pathway
  of chloroplastic lipid biosynthesis. As a result, LDR is conditionally activated
  to deter the unfavorable plant-rhizobacteria association. The question marks indicate
  unknown sensors of the bacterial volatiles.
