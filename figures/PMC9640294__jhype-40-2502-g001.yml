caption: 'Angiotensin II-stimulated AT1 receptor expression to suppress the IGF1R
  survival pathway in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts. (a) Angiotensin II significantly enhanced
  AT1 receptor expression in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts to suppress the IGF1R-PI3K/AKT pathways
  and inducing cleavage of caspase 8 and caspase 3. Angiotensin II: 100 nmol/l, isoproterenol:
  50 nmol/l, and lipopolysaccharides: 2 μg/ml (b) angiotensin II dose-dependent significantly
  increased expression levels of AT1 receptor and cleavage of caspase 3, with concomitant
  downregulation of GF1R-PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. (c) The treatment of angiotensin
  II affected AT1 receptor to downregulate the IGF1R pathway in a time-dependent manner.
  The prolonged treatment time attenuated AKT expression levels and upregulated cleaved
  caspase 8 and caspase 3 to activate cardiac cell apoptosis. Angiotensin II: 100 nmol/l.
  The protein expression levels were normalized to internal control β-actin. The results
  are expressed as protein fold change in treated groups compared with the control.
  Analysis of variance followed by the Tukey test was used to analyze the differences
  between the groups. Data are represented as mean ± SD from three independent experiments
  (ns: not significant, ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001).'
