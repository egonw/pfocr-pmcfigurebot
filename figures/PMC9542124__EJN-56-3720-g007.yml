caption: Smaller Ca2+response in peri‐ischaemic astrocytes of GC‐C KO animals. Changes
  in intracellular Ca2+ concentration in astrocytes after UGN stimulation (100 nM)
  is shown as ΔF/F0. (a) Summarised results for both wild‐type (WT) littermate groups
  (GC‐C WT and UGN WT) showed a significant increase in Ca2+signalling in the ipsilateral
  hemisphere compared with the contralateral hemisphere (*p = .002). (b) GC‐C KO animals
  showed no difference in Ca2+signalling after UGN stimulation between hemispheres.
  (c) UGN KO animals exhibited an increased Ca2+response for 17 s in the ipsilateral
  hemisphere when compared with the contralateral hemisphere (*p = .0005–.0387). (d)
  No difference in Ca2+ signal was recorded in the contralateral hemisphere of GC‐C
  WT (nanimals = 4, nslices = 8, ncells = 40) and GC‐C KO animals (nanimals = 3, nslices = 6,
  ncells = 38). (e) GC‐C KO animals (nanimals = 3, nslices = 6, ncells = 30) showed
  a significant smaller Ca2+response to UGN stimulation compared with GC‐C WT (nanimals = 4,
  nslices = 7, ncells = 34) animals in the ipsilateral hemisphere affected by stroke
  (*p = .005–.018). (f) No difference in strength of Ca2+response was recorded in
  the contralateral hemisphere of UGN WT (nanimals = 3, nslices = 5, ncells = 28)
  and UGN KO (nanimals = 3, nslices = 6, ncells = 22) animals, but the Ca2+response
  in UGN KO animals was prolonged for 3 s (*p = .025–.047 statistically significant
  difference between UGN WT and UGN KO Ca2+ responses). (g) Ca2+response to UGN stimulation
  in UGN KO animals (nanimals = 3, nslices = 6, ncells = 37) was of similar intensity
  to UGN WT animals (nanimals = 3, nslices = 5, ncells = 19), but was significantly
  longer (*p = .00002–.02789 statistically significant difference between UGN WT and
  UGN KO Ca2+ responses). Data were analysed by unpaired Students t‐test. Data are
  presented as mean ± SEM. The bar indicates a length of 10 s
