caption: ARG inhibited the invasion and EMT of SiHa and HeLa cells. (A) The invaded
  cell numbers of SiHa and HeLa cells were counted by transwell assays after cell
  were administrated with 5, 10 and 20 μM ARG for 24 h. (B) The relative protein expressions
  of E-cadherin, Vimentin and N-cadherin in SiHa and HeLa cells were determined by
  Western blot after cell were incubated with 5, 10 and 20 μM ARG for 24 h. Data were
  exhibited after normalized with GAPDH. *P˂0.05 and **P˂0.01 vs. 0 μM ARG.
