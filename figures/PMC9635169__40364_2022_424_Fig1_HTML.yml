caption: WASH is a direct target of miR-637 in ESCC cells. A The database miRanda
  and TargetScan were used to predict candidate miRNAs targeting WASH. B Relative
  expression of WASH was analyzed by qRT-PCR in KYSE70 cells transfected with the
  miRNA mimics for negative control (NC) or predicted candidates targeting WASH. C,
  D The down-regulation of WASH expression was determined in both KYSE70 and KYSE450
  cells transfected with miR-637 mimic by qRT-PCR (C) and Western blotting (D), respectively.
  E, F The up-regulation of WASH expression was confirmed in both KYSE70 and KYSE450
  cells transfected with miR-637 inhibitor by qRT-PCR (E) and Western blotting (F),
  respectively. G, H The relative levels of miR-637 were measured by qRT-PCR assays
  in KYSE70 cells and KYSE450 cells after transfection with mi-637 mimic (G) or miR-637
  inhibitor (H), respectively. I Schematic representation of WASH 3′-UTR wild type
  (WT), and mutant (Mut) with altered residues in the core region of miR-637 binding
  site. J Luciferase activity in 293 T cells co-transfected with WASH WT-3′-UTR or
  Mut-3′-UTR constructs and miR-637 or NC mimic, respectively. Data are presented
  as mean ± standard deviation. ns, not significant; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
