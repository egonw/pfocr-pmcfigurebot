caption: (A)The chemical structure of ginsenoside Rh4. (B) KYSE30, KYSE150, and KYSE410
  were measured with designated content (0–140 µM) of Rh4 cell viability (C) Migration
  images of Rh4 cells with or without the addition of Rh4 cells at 0, 12, and 24 h.
  The yellow line is the migration edge. Scale bar = 100 µm (D) Percent wound healing,
