caption: 'DS cells exhibit marked dysregulation of metabolism compared to healthy
  control cells; effect of AOAA. Various isotopologues (e.g. amino acids, lipids and
  additional metabolic intermediates) detected by fluxomic analysis are shown in n = 8
  human euploid control fibroblasts and n = 8 DS fibroblasts, as summarized in , with/without
  AOAA treatment (3 μM). *p ≤ 0.05 and **p ≤ 0.01 indicate significant differences
  between DSC untreated vs. CC untreated; #p ≤ 0.05 and ##p ≤ 0.01 indicate significant
  differences between CC + AOAA vs. CC untreated or DSC + AOAA vs. DSC untreated.'
