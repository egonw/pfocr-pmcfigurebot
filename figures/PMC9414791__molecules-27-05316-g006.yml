caption: 'Protective effect of 80% ethanolic extract from Gimcheon 1ho (GC) cultivar
  walnut (Juglans regia) on malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in HFD-induced mice biochemical
  changes related with antioxidant system: (a) hepatic MDA level; (b) cerebral MDA
  level Results shown are mean ± SD (n = 5). Data are statistically represented with
  * = significantly different from the NC group, and # = significantly different from
  PM group; # p < 0.05, ** and ##p < 0.01. Bold line indicates mean.'
