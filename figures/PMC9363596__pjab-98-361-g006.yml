caption: '(Color online) Effects of lanthanum hydroxide treatment on PI3K-AKT-HIF-1α
  pathway related proteins in the thoracic aorta of chronic kidney disease (CKD) model
  rats. (A) Serum ROS levels in rats with CKD and hyperphosphatemia after 4 weeks
  of treatment with lanthanum hydroxide. (B) Serum ROS levels in rats with CKD and
  hyperphosphatemia after 4 weeks of treatment with lanthanum hydroxide. (a) MDA;
  (b) SOD; (c) LPO (  , compared with the control group, ##p < 0.01; compared with
  the model group, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, n = 15). (C) Expression levels of PI3K,
  p-PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, m-TOR, p-mTOR, HIF-1α, VEGF, BMP-2, and SM22α in the cytoplasm.
  (D) Quantification of PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, m-TOR, p-mTOR, HIF-1α, VEGF, BMP-2,
  and SM22α expression levels in the cytoplasm. (E) Expression levels of HIF-1α and
  RUNX2 in the nucleus. (F) Quantification of HIF-1α and RUNX2 expression levels in
  the nucleus. (G) Effect of lanthanum hydroxide on the expression levels of VEGF,
  SM22α, BMP-2, and RUNX2 mRNA (  , compared with the control group, #p < 0.05, ##p
  < 0.01; compared with the model group, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, n = 3).'
