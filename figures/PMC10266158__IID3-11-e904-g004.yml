caption: 'Effects of Icariin on mitochondrial apoptosis in adriamycin‐induced NRK‐52e
  cells. CON: control. (A) Effects of adriamycin (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 μg/mL) on
  the viability of NRK‐52e cells. (B) Effects of icariin (0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50 μM)
  on the viability of adriamycin (0.5 μg/mL)‐induced NRK‐52e cells. (C) The level
  of ROS in NRK‐52e cells was measured by flow cytometry. (D) The level of MMP in
  NRK‐52e cells was measured by flow cytometry. (E) The level of apoptosis in NRK‐52e
  cells was measured by flow cytometry. (F) Western blot detection of PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathway‐related protein levels. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD, n = 3 rats
  per group, *p < .05, **p < .01 compared with the ADR group. ADR, adriamycin‐induced
  nephropathy; EPI‐H, Epimedium sagittatum Maxim high dose group; EPI‐L, Epimedium
  sagittatum Maxim low dose; ICA, Icariin; ROS, reactive oxygen species.'

  by restraining inflammation and apoptosis via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
