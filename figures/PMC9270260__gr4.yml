caption: ERK pathway scaffold proteins KSR1 and KSR2 do not regulate PKCα-induced
  growth arrest in IEC-18 cells. IEC-18 cells were transfected with the indicated
  siRNAs 96 h prior to treatment with PMA for 6 h, followed by flow cytometric analysis
  of DNA content/cell cycle distribution (A) or Western blot analysis for confirmation
  of KSR1 knockdown (B). C, IEC-18 cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs
  72 h prior to treatment with PMA for 2 h and Western blot analysis for the indicated
  proteins. D, Western blot analysis of KSR2 expression in IEC-18 cells, with rat
  brain lysate included as a positive control. Data are representative of three independent
  experiments. PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.
