caption: 'Expression of TIAM2 promotes proliferation, migration, and invasion of OS
  cells. A: Western blot showed TIAM2 protein levels extracted from TIAM2-OE and the
  control group in 143B and U2OS cells. B: Quantification of the band density ratio
  of TIAM2 to GAPDH. C, D: Detection of cell proliferation using the CCK-8 assay.
  E-F, H-I: The wound distance of TIAM2-OE and the control group (0 h, 24 h, and 48 h)
  determined using wound healing assays. G: The number of migrated cells in the TIAM2-OE
  and control groups determined using the transwell assay. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.'
