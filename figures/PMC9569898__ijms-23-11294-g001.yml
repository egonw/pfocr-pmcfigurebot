caption: KLB expression was elevated in ESCs of patients with IUA. (A) KLB was expressed
  in both stromal and epithelial cells. Compared with the normal control group, the
  expression of KLB in ESCs of patients with IUA was increased. Scale bar = 100 μm.
  (B) The primary ESCs were extracted and identified with Vimentin. Immunofluorescence
  showed that the positive rate of Vimentin was more than 96%. Scale bar = 50 μm.
  (C) Through RT-qPCR analysis, it was found that the expression of KLB mRNA in the
  primary ESCs of the IUA group was higher than in those of the normal control group.
  (D) The expression of KLB and the fibrosis marker Fibronectin (FN) in primary ESCs
  of the IUA group and normal control group was detected and analyzed using Western
  blotting. It was found that the expression of KLB and FN increased in the primary
  ESCs of IUA patients. (E) Spearman rank correlation analysis showed that the expressions
  of KLB and FN proteins in ESCs were positively correlated. ** p < 0.01; *** p ≤
  0.001.
