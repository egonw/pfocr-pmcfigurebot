caption: Increased circPPP1R12A expression was observed in NSCLC cells. (A) CircPPP1R12A
  expression in tumor and adjacent normal tissues was confirmed by RT‐PCR. (B) CircPPP1R12A
  expression in BEAS‐2B, A549 and H1299 cells was determined by RT‐PCR. (C) RT‐PCR
  was used to detect the expression of circPPP1R12A in A549 and H1299 cells after
  transfection with Lv‐control or Lv‐circPPP1P12A. (D) The viability of A549 and H1299
  cells was confirmed by CCK‐8 after Lv‐control or Lv‐circPPP1R12A transfection. (E)
  The apoptosis of A549 and H1299 cells was determined by TUNEL assay. (F) Transwell
  assay was used to confirm A549 and H1299 cell invasion after Lv‐control or Lv‐circPPP1R12A
  transfection. (G) The migration of A549 and H1299 cells was confirmed by Wound healing
  assay after Lv‐control or Lv‐circPPP1R12A transfection.
