caption: PQQ administration reduces BALF inflammatory cell counts and changes IFN-γ
  and IL-4 secretion. (a) Total cell numbers in BALF were counted with an Automatic
  Blood Cell Analyzer and specific differential cell counts in BALF were tested by
  flow cytometer. (b) Levels of released IFN-γ in BALF as measured by ELISA. (c) Levels
  of released IL-4 in BALF measured by ELISA. The columns and error bars represent
  the means and SEMs (n = 5 per group). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01. Similar results were
  obtained in at least three independent experiments.
