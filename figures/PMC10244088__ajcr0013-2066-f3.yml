caption: 'The deficiency of GRIK3 contributed to the activation of UBE2C/CDK1/Wnt
  signaling pathways. A. The top 30 downregulated genes in the high GRIK3 group (as
  compared to the low GRIK3 group) that were analyzed using the TCGA database. B.
  Western blotting of UBE2C and CDK1 in vector cells and A549/NCI-H1299 cells with
  GRIK3 overexpression. C. The relative expression of UBE2C in A549/NCI-H1299 cells
  treated with scramble siRNA, UBE2C siRNA #1 and 2, as determined by quantified PCR.
  D. The relative expression of CDK1 in A549/NCI-H1299 cells treated with scramble
  siRNA, CDK1 siRNA #1 and 2, as determined by quantified PCR. E. Western blotting
  of Wnt-3a in vector or GRIK3 overexpressed A549/NCI-H1299 cells treated with scramble
  siRNA, CDK1 siRNA, and UBE2C siRNA. F. The relative cell proliferation of vector
  cells and A549/NCI-H1299 cells with GRIK3 overexpression that were treated with
  scramble siRNA, CDK1 siRNA and UBE2C siRNA. G. The colony formation capability of
  vector cells and A549/NCI-H1299 cells with GRIK3 overexpression that were treated
  with scramble siRNA, CDK1 siRNA and UBE2C siRNA. H and I. Immunofluorescence of
  CDK1 and UBE2C in NSCLC tissues from recurrent (n=15) and non-recurrent (n=15) patients.
  The scale bar was 50 Î¼m. The protein expression intensity was calculated.'
