caption: CircNDST1 promotes CSNK2A1 binding to Akt by interacting with CSNK2A1. A
  The specific biotin-labeled circNDST1 probe was added to the TPC1 lysate, and the
  precipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by silver staining. Next,
  the differential bands in the lane of the circNDST1 sense probe were identified
  by mass spectrometry (MS). The antisense of circNDST1 was used as a control. As
  shown in the figure, CSNK2A1 was identified. B RNA pull-down assay with circNDST1
  probe and antisense probe and verification of CSNK2A1-specific presence in the experimental
  group. C RIP experiment was performed with anti-CSNK2A1 antibody, and the abundance
  of circNDST1 in RNA precipitates was detected by RT-qPCR. IgG was used as a control
  group. *P < 0.05 D Effect of knockdown of circNDST1 on CSNK2A1 detected by Western
  blot. e Protein immunoprecipitation with anti-CSNK2A1 antibodies and verification
  of CSNK2A1 binding to Akt by Western blot. f TPC1 cells with knockdown circNDST1
  were incubated with anti-CSNK2A1 antibody for protein immunoprecipitation and Western
  blot to detect changes in precipitated Akt
