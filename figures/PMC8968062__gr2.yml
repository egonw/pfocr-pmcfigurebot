caption: 'cGAS-STING pathway deficiency impedes tumor initiation and tumorsphere formation.
  (A) Serial dilution of NC and knockout group of HeLa cells was used to test tumor
  initiation among different groups. n = 5 for each group. (B) Quantitation of soft
  agar colony numbers of NC and knockout group from different tumors. (C–E) Tumorsphere
  formation assay of NC and knockout groups from HeLa cells (C), MCF-7 cells (D) and
  PANC-1 cells (E). The number and size of tumor spheres was determined by microscopy.
  Scale bar: 50 μm in upper panel, 100 μm in lower panel. (F) The expression of Nanog,
  Sox2, Oct4 in NC, cGAS-/- and SSTING-/- HeLa cells were detected by Western blot.
  The quantification of the band intensity of Western blot was provided in the Supplementary
  Table S5. Data were represented as mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.'
