caption: Dimorphic impact of CAR deletion on the hepatic transcriptome. Microarray
  analysis of hepatic transcriptome was performed. (A) Principal component analysis
  (PCA) with separation of data by two dimensions. (B) Heatmap representation of gene
  expression for each individual; the hierarchical clustering was obtained using Ward’s
  criterion and Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Red and green, respectively, indicate
  values above and below the mean averaged, centered and scaled expression values
  (Z-score). Black shows values close to the mean. Venn diagrams with the number of
  up-regulated (C) or down-regulated (D) genes in CAR−/− mice. Sex-specific variations
  were further analyzed, and enrichment of Kegg pathways is reported with gene number
  and corresponding p-value. (E) The 36 genes of NAFLD pathway which are specifically
  up-regulated in CAR−/− females were represented for both male and females.
