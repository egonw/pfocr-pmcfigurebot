caption: Effect of LPS on PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway during pregnancy. At day
  7 of pregnancy. Effect of LPS on factors influencing mRNA expression of PI3K/AKT/NF-κB
  signaling pathway in uteri of mice (A); Effect LPS on factors influencing mRNA expression
  of PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway in uteri of mice at day 15 of pregnancy (B);

  pregnancy (C). * Statistical difference between LPS (+) and LPS (-) groups in the
  same period (p < 0.05); ** statistical difference between LPS (+) and LPS (-) groups
  in the same period (p < 0.01).
