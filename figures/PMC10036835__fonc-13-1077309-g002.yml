caption: The expression of genes related to the MAPK signaling pathway in KIRC and
  univariate Cox regression analysis. (A) The differential expression of 81 MAPK signaling
  pathway-related genes in cancer and normal tissue in KIRC patients. Red represents
  the gene that is highly expressed in the tumor. The darker the color, the higher
  the expression level; blue represents the gene that is lowly expressed in the tumor,
  and the color the deeper it is, the lower the expression level. (B) Perform univariate
  Cox regression analysis on genes related to the MAPK signaling pathway. (C) The
  String database was used to analyze the protein interaction of 81 genes related
  to the MAPK signaling pathway, and the Cystoscope software platform was used to
  visualize the analysis results. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, and ***P<0.001.
