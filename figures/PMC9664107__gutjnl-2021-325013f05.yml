caption: NFATc1 regulated gene signatures and signalling mechanisms. (A) Representative
  western blot and qRT-PCR showing successful NFATc1 transfection and expression in
  AML12 cells. (B) Heatmap depicting z-scores of significantly differentially expressed
  genes in RNA-Seq analysis on NFATc1 overexpression in AML12 cells. (C) Reactome
  pathway classification analysis demonstrating the most significantly regulated NFATc1
  gene signatures in AML12 cells identified by RNA-Seq (log2fold values≥0.5/≤−0.5;
  p≤0.05; base mean>10). (D) qRT-PCR validation of differentially regulated candidate
  genes on NFATc1 activation in AML12 cells. Data are shown in mean±SD, p values are
  *p<0.05, **p<0.005. Statistical analysis was performed by unpaired t-test.
