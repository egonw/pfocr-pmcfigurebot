caption: A schematic diagram of the mTOR and PI3K/Akt pathway. Raptor and rictor are
  two mTOR-interacting proteins that define 2 separate branches of the mTOR pathway.
  Raptor–mTOR pathway regulates cell growth through interactions with S6K1 and 4E-BP1
  proteins. Nutrients can influence the response of the raptor–mTOR branch []. The
  rictor–mTOR pathway regulates Akt/PKB to control cell survival, proliferation, metabolism,
  and cytoskeleton formation. The binding of growth factors to receptors such as PDGF
  activates PI3K to generate Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) (3,4,5) P3 from PtdIns
  (4,5) P2. This recruits the PDK1 kinase and Akt/PKB to the membrane. PTEN is a tumor
  suppressor gene that regulates the activity of PI3K. Akt/PKB can then be activated
  by phosphorylation at 2 separate sites []. Rictor–mTOR complex phosphorylates Ser473
  on Akt/PKB; this may lead to the phosphorylation of Akt/PKB on Thr308. The regulation
  of this complex is relatively unknown. Solid arrows indicate direct interactions
  and dash arrows indicate interactions that are indirect []. Image created by DA
