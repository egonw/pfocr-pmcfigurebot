caption: 'ARHGAP5‐AS1‐induced upregulation of CSDE1 promotes translation of VIM and
  RAC1 as well as stimulation of the ERK signalling. (A,B) Knockdown of CSDE1 with
  its siRNAs (siC1‐1 and siC1‐2) substantially suppressed the proliferation of HCC
  cells. (C) Effects of CSDE1‐knockdown on the colony formation of HepG2 and SK‐HEP‐1
  cells. (D) Silencing of CSDE1 reduced the invasion abilities of HCC cells. (E) Expression
  of CSDE1 was compared between normal and cancer samples in the Shandong cohort and
  Jiangsu cohort. (F) The Kaplan–Meier analyses of the survival time of TCGA HCC patients
  were stratified according to CSDE1 expression levels. (G) Silencing of CSDE1 evidently
  decreased levels of VIM and RAC1 as well as phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204)
  in HCC cells. (H) HepG2 or SK‐HEP‐1 cells with stable ARHGAP5‐AS1‐knockdown showed
  markedly downregulated expression of VIM and RAC1 as well as phosphorylated ERK1/2.
  (I) Ectopic ARHGAP5‐AS1 expression obviously increased levels of VIM and RAC1 as
  well as phosphorylated ERK1/2. (J) Graphical representation of the functions of
  lncRNA ARHGAP5‐AS1 in HCC. (i) METTL14 is the m6A writer of lncRNA ARHGAP5‐AS1.
  (ii) IGF2BP2 acts as the m6A reader to stabilise ARHGAP5‐AS1 in HCC. (iii) The E3
  ligase TRIM28 promotes ubiquitination and degradation of oncoprotein CSDE1 via the
  ubiquitin‐proteasome pathway. (iv) ARHGAP5‐AS1 attenuates the binding of CSDE1 with
  TRIM28. v) ARHGAP5‐AS1‐induced upregulation of CSDE1 promotes translation of VIM
  and RAC1 as well as stimulation of the ERK signalling. Data information: The difference
  between the two groups was calculated using Student''s t‐test. **p < 0.01, ***p
  < 0.001. Data shows one representative of three independent experiments with three
  biological replicates.'
