caption: DSB repair pathway MRE11–ATM–SOG1 acts downstream of TOP6A3-overexpression-induced
  resistance to Xoo.(A) Disease symptoms of bacterial blight at 8 days after inoculation
  with ZJ173. The fifth leaf blades were photographed for atm-3, sog1, atm-3 sog1,
  SOG1-FLAG-OE1, MRE11RNAi, and mre11 lines and their WTs (DJ and ZH11).(B) Quantification
  of the lesion lengths shown in (A). Values are the means ± SE (n = 10).(C) Disease
  symptoms of bacterial blight at 14 d after inoculation with ZJ173. The fifth leaf
  blades were photographed for the ku70 and atr mutants and their WTs (DJ and ZH11),
  and FLAG leaves were photographed for atm-2, 6B-OE1, 6A3-OE1, and atm-2 TOP6A3-OE1
  lines and WT (K3). 6B-OE1, TOP6B-OE1-overexpressing line; 6A3-OE1, TOP6A3-OE1-overexpressing
  line; atm-2 6A3-OE1, atm-2 TOP6A3-OE1 line.(D) Quantification of the lesion lengths
  shown in (C).Values are the means ± SE (n = 10).
