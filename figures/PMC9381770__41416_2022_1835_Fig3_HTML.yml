figure_title: Rectal cancer patients with low ALDH1L2 expression are not responsive
  to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy
caption: a Kaplan–Meier survival curve of GSE14333 (n = 290). b Gene expression was
  obtained and compared in 3 GEO datasets. c ROC curve of ALDH1L2 expression in GSE46862.
  d Representative IHC staining of ALDH1L2 in rectal cancer tissues with different
  TRG scores. e IHC scores in different TRG score groups. f Correlation between TRG
  scores and IHC scores. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
