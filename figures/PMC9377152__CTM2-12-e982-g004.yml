caption: Deletion of Men1 induces fibrosis‐related changes in signalling pathway networks.
  (A) Multidimensional scaling plot showing separation of the Men1 f/f and Men1Δ/Δ
  mouse kidney tissues at 12 months. (B) Heat map representing transcripts with upregulated
  (red) or downregulated (blue) expression in kidney tissues of the Men1 f/f and Men1Δ/Δ
  mice. (C) Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showing representative biological
  processes (BPs), molecular functions (MFs) and cellular components (CCs) for differentially
  expressed genes between the Men1 f/f and Men1Δ/Δ mouse kidney tissues. (D and E)
  BubbleMap showing representative KEGG and Reactome pathways for fibrosis‐related
  pathways affected by Men1 deficiency. (F) GSEA of cell cycle, base excision, apoptosis‐multiple
  species and Ras signalling genes in kidney tissues of the Men1 f/f and Men1Δ/Δ mice
  at 12 months. (G) Quantitative real‐time PCR (qPCR) was used to detect the mRNA
  expression of the indicated genes in the kidney tissues of the Men1 f/f and Men1Δ/Δ
  mice at 12 months (n = 9 mice in the Men1 f/f and n = 14 mice in the Men1Δ/Δ groups);
  the data are represented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) (t‐test, two‐sided).
