figure_title: Mutagenesis of the entire cytoplasmic intracellular loop of IFITM3 finely
  maps the domain involved in the egress of IFITM3 from the Golgi
caption: (A) Individual amino acid of the cytoplasmic intracellular loop were changed
  to alanine or to glycine when alanine residues were present, before confocal microscopy
  analysis. Representative pictures are shown here (IFITM3 only), whereas their colocalization
  with the cis-Golgi marker GM130 is shown in the extended data . (B) Quantification
  of the IFITM3 proportion in Golgi is provided as a Golgi/cytoplasm ratio in the
  box and whisker plot (20 cells per mutant in two to three independent experiments
  analyzed). Asterisks and lines within the box indicate averages and median values,
  respectively. Yellow boxes indicate mutants with Golgi/cytoplasm IFITM3 ratios equivalent
  to the 85-90 IFITM3 mutant and non-statistically significant when compared with
  85-90 following an ordinary one-way ANOVA, Dunnettâ€™s multiple comparisons test.
  (C) Representative WB analysis of mutant proteins. Uncropped blots and source data
  are provided in the relevant section.Source data are available for this figure.
