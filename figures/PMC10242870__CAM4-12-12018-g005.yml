caption: DKK1 expression is related to AFP in AFPGC. (A) Bubble chart showing the
  top 15 genes related to AFP expression via correlation analysis. (B) Scatter plots
  showing the correlation between AFP expression and three selected genes using TCGA
  gastric cancer dataset. (C) Violin plot shows DKK1 expression level among malignant
  epithelium clusters. (D) Consensus clustering divided 341 cases (from TCGA‐STAD
  cohort) into two groups, namely the AFPGC group (45 cases) and common gastric cancer
  (GC) group (296 cases). (E) Bubble chart showing the enriched pathway of AFPGC upregulated
  genes. (F) Bar diagram showing the expression level of several marker genes and
  hepatocyte score based on GSVA. (G) Correlation between AFP and DKK1 expression
  among 45 AFPGC patients in TCGA cohort. (H) HE stains and immunohistochemistry on
  another two AFPGC tissues. All pictures were captured at a magnification of 100×.
  (I) Western blot showing AFP, ALB, GPC3, and several EMT marker expression in FU97
  cells with or without DKK1 stimulation. RT‐qPCR was performed to detect AFP transcription
  level. FU97 was treated with DKK1 (0.1 μg/mL) and incubated for 48 h before extracting
  protein and total RNA.
