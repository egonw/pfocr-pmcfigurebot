caption: Sam68 siRNA prevents the insulin-dependent activation of PI3K and MAPK pathways
  in human GCs from healthy donors. GCs were transfected with Sam68 siRNA or NC1-scrambled
  negative control siRNA (basal) duplexes, as described in , and incubated in absence
  or presence of 10 nM insulin for 10 min. GC lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE,
  and Western blot analysis was performed by using anti-P-PKB, anti-P-ERK1/2, and
  anti-P-IRS-1 antibodies to study insulin activation of the PI3K and MAPK signaling
  pathway. Sample protein loading was controlled by using anti-GAPDH antibodies. We
  show the corresponding densitometric analysis of three independent experiments as
  means ± SD; statistical analyses were performed by ANOVA. Asterisks indicate significant
  differences from the untreated controls according to Bonferroni’s multiple comparison
  post-hoc test.
