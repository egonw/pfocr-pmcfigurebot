caption: 'WGCNA of metabolites and differentially expressed genes. (A): Differential
  gene hierarchical module cluster diagram and the number of genes in each module.
  Genes with similar expression patterns were classified into the same module, and
  the branches of the clustering tree were cut and differentiated to generate different
  modules. Each color represents a module, and gray indicates genes that could not
  be assigned to any one module. The modules were further merged. (B): Module-trait
  relationship of 29 metabolites with 17 gene modules. The Pearson correlation coefficient
  was used to plot the eigenvalues of the module and the physiological data. Red represents
  a positive correlation, and green represents a negative correlation. The darker
  the color, the stronger the correlation. * signifificant at level 0.05, ** signifificant
  at level 0.01, *** signifificant at level 0.001. (C): Cytoscape of the top 100 relationship
  pairs of connectivity in the module. Points represent genes, and lines represent
  a regulatory relationship between two points. The darker and larger the node color
  and line, the stronger the connectivity. (D): Venn of differential genes annotated
  on the flavonoid metabolic pathway.'
