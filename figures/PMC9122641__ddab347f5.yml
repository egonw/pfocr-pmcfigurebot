caption: Functional characterization of PPP1R14A in prostate cancer. (A) Methylation
  status of probes near CTCF binding site in TCGA prostate cancer cohorts. ‘Normal’
  indicated normal prostate tissues. P-value indicates testing for linear trend between
  means and subgroups in primary cancer tissues. (B) Probe-based methylation status
  in TCGA prostate cancer cohorts (Upper, error bars represent standard error of the
  mean of beta value) and progression hazard ratio for each probe (Lower, bars represent
  95% confidence interval of HR). (C) Kaplan–Meier curve of progression-free survival
  stratified by median cg22730305 percentages. (D) RNA expression of PPP1R14A gene
  expression, exon quantification and first exon ψ in TCGA prostate cancer cohorts.
  Normal indicated normal prostate tissues. P-value indicates testing for linear trend
  between means and subgroups in primary cancer tissues. (E, G) Kaplan–Meier curve
  of progression-free survival stratified by first/second exon ratio (E), first exon
  ψ (F) and PPP1R14A gene expression (G). (H, I) Western blotting for stably overexpressing
  PPP1R14A isoform constructs, followed by proliferation assays in 22Rv1 (H) and PC3
  (I) cells. (J, K) Top five HALLMARK gene sets positively enriched with PPP1R14A
  expression (J) and exon one ψ ratio (K) in TCGA prostate cancer cohort. (L) Heatmap
  showing myogenesis pathway gene expressions in TCGA prostate cancer column-wise
  ordered by ascending PPP1R14A expressions. (M) Heatmap showing MYC target gene profiling
  in TCGA prostate cancer column-wise ordered by ascending first exon ψ.

  transition through allelic TF binding and CpG methylation.
