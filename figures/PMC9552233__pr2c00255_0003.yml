caption: Functional enrichment analysis. (A) The biological process enrichments showed
  upregulated aerobic respiration, cellular amine metabolic process, cellular respiration,
  etc. (B) Cellular component enrichment illustrated enhanced inner mitochondrial
  membrane protein complex and mitochondrial respiratory chain. (C) Molecular function
  enrichment demonstrated elevated NADH dehydrogenase activity and NADH dehydrogenase
  (ubiquinone) activity. (D) KEGG pathway enrichment showed the upregulated pathways
  including metabolism/degradation of amino acids, fatty acid degradation, and TCA
  cycle. Green arrows point to the elevated aerobic respiration, mitochondrial respiratory
  chain, NADH dehydrogenase activity, amino acid and fatty acid degradation, and TCA
  cycle.
