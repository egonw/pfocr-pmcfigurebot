caption: 'KYN levels of ALS, FTD, FTD–ALS, EOAD and CONTR participants. KYN levels
  are visualized by boxplots clustered according to brain region. White dots represent
  the minimal and maximal outliers. Post hoc Bonferroni-adjusted significance values
  are classified as p ≤ 0.05, p ≤ 0.01 and p ≤ 0.001 and are indicated by one, two
  or three asterisks, respectively. Abbreviations: BA22 = Brodmann area 22, ALS =
  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, FTD = frontotemporal dementia, EOAD = early onset
  Alzheimer’s disease, CONTR = control individuals, KYN = kynurenine.'
article_title: Brain Kynurenine Pathway Metabolite Levels May Reflect Extent of Neuroinflammation
