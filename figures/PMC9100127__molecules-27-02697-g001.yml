caption: 23,24-dihydrocucurbitacin E (DHCE) effectively suppressed the proliferation
  of gastric cancer cells. (A) Chemical structure of DHCE. (B,C) MTT assay of cell
  viability in MGC803 and SGC7901 cells treated with DHCE (0–100 μM) for 24 and 48
  h, respectively. (D) MTT assay of cell viability in normal gastric epithelial (GES-1)
  cells treated with DHCE (0–128 μM) for 24 h. (E) Clones in MGC803 and SGC7901 cells
  treated with DHCE (0, 0.1, 0.2, or 0.4 μM) for 10 days in a colony formation assay
  and the statistic results of colony formation assays. The experiment was performed
  in triplicate, and the statistical results are expressed as means ± SD (* p < 0.05
  and ** p < 0.01 compared with the control group).
