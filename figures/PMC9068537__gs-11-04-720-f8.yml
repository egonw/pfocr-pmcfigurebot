caption: 'Expression of immune checkpoint genes in breast cancer and their relationship
  with STAT4. (A) Expression of eight immune checkpoint genes in breast tumor tissues
  and normal tissues, where the horizontal axis represents different genes and the
  vertical axis represents the distribution of expression of that gene. The different
  colors represent different groups, and the asterisks represent the levels of significance:
  *, P<0.05; ***, P<0.001. (B) Relationship between STAT4 and two kinds of immune
  checkpoint pathway genes (inhibitory, stimulatory). STAT, signal transducer and
  activator of transcription.'
