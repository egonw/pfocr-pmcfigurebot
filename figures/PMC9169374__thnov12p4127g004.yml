caption: 'Exogenous EPHA2 promotes endothelial cell angiogenesis through a ligand-dependent
  forward signaling. A Western blot analysis of Ephrin A1 expression in lentivirus-infected
  HUVEC expressing control or Ephrin A1-specific shRNA (Left). HM-Exos failed to induce
  an upregulation of Tyr588 in Ephrin A1-KD HUVECs compared to control cells (Middle).
  Exosomes from EPHA2-expressing HEK-293T cells failed to induce an upregulation of
  Tyr588 in Ephrin A1-KD HUVECs compared with control cells (Right). B HM-Exos or
  EPHA2-rich exosomes failed to promote the tube-forming ability of Ephrin A1-KD cells.
  C Western blot analysis of EPHA2 expression in lentivirus-infected HUVEC expressing
  control or EPHA2-specific shRNA (Left). HM-Exos induces upregulation of Tyr588 in
  EPHA2-KD HUVECs compared to control cells (Middle). Exosomes from EPHA2-expressing
  HEK-293T cells induce an upregulation of Tyr588 in EPHA2-KD HUVECs compared with
  control cells (Right). D HM-Exos and EPHA2-rich exosomes still promote the tube-forming
  ability of EPHA2-KD HUVECs. All experiments were repeated at least three times.
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,***P < 0.001 and ns P > 0.05 indicate no statistical significance.
