caption: Effects of E. japonica parasitism on the expression levels of genes involved
  in amino acid and protein metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and lipid biosynthesis
  of B. mori at 3-, 5-, 7- and 8-DAP. (A) The relative expression levels of genes
  involved in amino acid and protein metabolism. (B) Expression levels of metabolic
  genes involved in glycolysis pathway. (C) RT-qPCR analysis of the expression levels
  of key enzymes involved in lipid biosynthesis. All transcriptional data were normalized
  to the expression level of Rp49. The statistical significance is indicated by *
  p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 or *** p < 0.001. The results are shown as the mean Â± S. D.
