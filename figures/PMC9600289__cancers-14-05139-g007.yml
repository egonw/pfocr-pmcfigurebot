caption: Combined effects of m6A regulators on ESCA progression. (A) Ref. [] Cigarette
  smoking enhanced ALKBH5 expression through decreasing methylation of ALKBH5 promoter,
  downregulated m6A modification of LINC00278 and binding of YTHDF1 with LINC00278
  and consequently led to translation suppression of Yin Yang 1 (YY1)-binding micropeptide
  (YY1BM), a micropeptide encoded by LINC00278. Downregulation of YY1BM promoted the
  interaction of YY1 with androgen receptor (AR), activated AR signaling pathway and
  increased eEF2K expression. Under nutrient deprivation, the elevated phosphorylation
  of eEF2 inhibited activity of eEF2 and translation elongation and increased survival
  of ESCC cells; (B) Ref. [] miR-193a-3p could target ALKBH5 and inhibit expression
  of ALKBH5. Interestingly, knockdown of ALKBH5 promoted the maturation of miR-193a-3p.
  Thus, miR-193a-3p and ALKBH5 formed a positive feedback loop, which facilitated
  proliferation and metastasis of ESCC cells in vitro and in vivo; (C) Ref. [] Overexpression
  of METTL3 enhanced m6A level of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mRNA in an METTL14-dependent
  way, elevated binding of YTHDF2 with APC mRNA and promoted degradation of APC mRNA.
  Decreased APC expression facilitated proliferation of ESCC cells through activating
  Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway; (D) Ref. [] Linc01305 interacted with IGF2BP2 and
  IGF2BP3 to increase stability of HTR3A mRNA and expression of HTR3A, then promoted
  proliferation and migration of ESCC cells; (E) Ref. [] RBM15 interacted with METTL3
  in a WTAP-dependent way to deposit m6A onto MALAT1, specifically located at nuclear
  speckles (NSs), and YTHDC1 could bind to m6A of MALAT1, which was important for
  NSs homeostasis and metastasis of ESCC cells; (F) Ref. [] Overexpression of FTO
  significantly reduced the enrichment of m6A at site 2 of LINC00022 transcript and
  led to a decrease in degradation of LINC00022 by YTHDF2. FTO promoted proliferation
  of ESCC cells by upregulating expression of LINC00022 in a YTHDF2-dependent pattern;
  (G) Ref. [] YTHDF1 increased stability of m6A-modified HK2 mRNA and upregulated
  expression of HK2, which mediated the role of HCP5 in promoting progression of ESCC.
  In this process, METTL3 acted as methyltransferase of HK2 mRNA; (H) Ref. [] FTO
  promoted proliferation, migration and invasion of ESCC cells by regulating m6A level
  of ERBB2, in which, YTHDF1, as reader of ERBB2, increased stability of ERBB2 mRNA;
  (I) Ref. [] Combined role of FTO and YTHDF1 resulted in upregulation of HSD17B11
  and progression of ESCC, in which, reduced m6A level of ERBB2 by FTO led to inhibition
  of YTHDF1-induced decreased translation efficiency of HSD17B11; (J) Ref. [] Increased
  m6A level of EGR1 mRNA by METTL3 and increased binding of m6A-modified EGR1 mRNA
  with YTDF3 led to upregulation of EGR1, activated Snail signaling pathway and promoted
  invasion and metastasis of ESCC cells.
