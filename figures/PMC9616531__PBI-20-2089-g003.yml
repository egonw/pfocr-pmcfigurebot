caption: 'Cell‐specific distribution of genes related to the biosynthesis of lignin
  and catechins, and discovery of novel glycosylated catechins. (a) Schematic diagram
  of the flavonoids and lignin biosynthesis pathway. Blue and red molecular structures
  represent backbones of lignin and catechins, respectively. (b) Heatmap of cell‐specific
  genes showing of the lignin and catechin biosynthesis pathway. E: epidermis cell;
  V: vascular bundle cells; M: mesophyll cells; P: proliferating cell. The original
  data of the heatmap can be found in . (c) Co‐expression network of UGTs and catechins
  biosynthesis genes in mesophyll cells. The purple dots present UGTs and the dot
  radius represents average gene expression level of scRNA‐Seq of mesophyll cells.
  The yellow dots present catechins biosynthesis related genes. The symbols and spearman
  correlation coefficients data are given in . (d) q‐RT‐PCR of UGT72B23 in 6 isolated
  tissues of 3 L. CsUBI (CSS0007748, ubiquitin‐conjugating enzyme) and CsACTIN (CSS0008920,
  actin 7 isoform 1) were used as references.'
