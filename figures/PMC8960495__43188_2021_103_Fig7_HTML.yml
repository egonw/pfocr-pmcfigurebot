caption: Pathway analysis revealed that networks of genes dysregulated by the in utero
  e-cig exposure were associated with regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition
  pathway in PND5 male offspring. At PND5, male offspring exposed in utero to e-cig
  aerosol exhibited dysregulation of genes associated with Wnt signaling, regulation
  of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway, PCP pathway, and TGF-B signaling,
  when compared to the respective in utero air control group. Genes in red show up-regulation,
  while genes in green show down-regulation
article_title: In utero exposure to electronic-cigarette aerosols decreases lung fibrillar
  collagen content, increases Newtonian resistance and induces sex-specific molecular
  signatures in neonatal mice.
