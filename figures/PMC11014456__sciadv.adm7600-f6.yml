figure_title: Neddylation inhibition leads to suppression of the YAP/TAZ pathway in
  Schwann cells
caption: (A) Immunoblot analyses and densitometric quantification of Hippo-Yap signaling
  pathway components in sciatic nerve lysates from control and Nae1 cKO mice at P28.
  Data are presented as means ± SEM; n = 3 to 8, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001.
  Two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test. (B) RT-qPCR showing regulation of YAP/TAZ
  target genes in sciatic nerves from Nae1 cKO mice at P28. Data are presented as
  means ± SEM; n = 4 to 12. Two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test. (C and D) Immunoblot
  analyses (C) and densitometric quantification (D) of MPZ and p-YAP levels in sciatic
  nerve lysates from control and Nae1 cKO mice, treated with vehicle or XMU-MP-1.
  Data are presented as means ± SEM. Two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparisons
  test. (E and F) Representative EM micrographs (E) and quantification of myelinated
  and amyelinated axons (1:1) per nerve (F) of P10 sciatic nerves from control and
  Nae1 cKO mice treated with vehicle or XMU-MP-1. Scale bar, 2 μm. Data are presented
  as means ± SEM; n = 3 to 4. Two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparisons test
  (between groups). (G) Immunoblot analyses of YAP/TAZ pathway components in primary
  rat Schwann cells cultured under basal or myelinogenic conditions (db cAMP treatment),
  in the presence or absence of MLN4924. β-Actin is used as loading control for immunoblots.
  (H) Immunoblot analyses showing that treatment with the MST1/2 inhibitor XMU-MP-1
  does not rescue the MLN4924-induced suppression of MPZ in primary rat Schwann cells
  cultured under myelinogenic conditions (db cAMP treatment). β-Actin is used as loading
  control for immunoblots in (A), (C), (G), and (H).
