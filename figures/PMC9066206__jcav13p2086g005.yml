caption: GSEA analysis of EDNRA in TCGA-STAD data. Several pathways and biological
  processes were differentially enriched in ENDRA-related STAD, GSEA showed the top-four
  pathways associated with EDNRA. (A) Immunoregulatory, (B) Hedgehog signaling pathway,
  (C) WNT signaling pathway, (D) PI3K-AKT signaling pathway ES, enrichment score;
  NES, normalized ES; adj. P, adjust P-value; FDR, false discovery rate.
