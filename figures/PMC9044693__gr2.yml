caption: Candidate SL/SDL partner genes(A) A panel of candidate SL/SDL-based known
  drug targets with an inhibitory mechanism of action. These drugs can be potentially
  repurposed to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.(B) Pathway enrichment results for the
  140 candidate SL/SDL-based targets. A bar plot showing the negative log10-transformed
  Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted p values (Padj) from Fisher’s exact tests (X axis) for
  the top pathways from the Reactome database () enriched by these SL/SDL-based targets.
  The color of the bars encodes the number of overlapping genes within each pathway.
  The black-dotted line corresponds to the cutoff of adjusted p < 0.05.(C) A similar
  plot as in (b) showing the top pathways enriched by the SARS-CoV-2-induced differentially
  expressed (DE) genes that form SL/SDL interactions with the 140 candidate target
  genes.(D) A heatmap illustrating the enrichment of DE gene – SL/SDL partner gene
  pairs formed by the 140 candidate targets in various combinations of pathways. Significant
  pathway combinations with adjusted p < 0.1 are shown here. Pathways of the DE genes
  are given on the horizontal axis (columns) and pathways of the SL/SDL partner genes
  are given on the vertical axis (rows) of the heatmap. Sizes of the circles correspond
  to their odds ratio of enrichment and color of the circles correspond to the negative
  log10 adjusted P values of a pathway combination.(E) Boxplot of one-sided Wilcoxon
  rank-sum test results for average cell number between 135 candidate genes and the
  rest of the genes in the genome-wide siRNA screen. P value is shown in between the
  boxes.
