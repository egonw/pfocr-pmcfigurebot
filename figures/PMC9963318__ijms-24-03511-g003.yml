caption: The central role of MYC2 in the JA signaling pathway and its application
  prospects in synthetic biology. (a) In the resting state, JAZ binds to and inhibits
  the transcription factor activity of MYC2 and inhibits the transcription of the
  JA gene. (b) Under stress, JA-Ile promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of
  JAZ, relieves the inhibition of MYC2 by JAZ, and activates the JA signaling pathway.
  (c) Applying the onâ€“off function of MYC2 to synthetic biology techniques to produce
  medicinally valuable plant specialized metabolites using plants or microorganisms
  as chassis cells.
