caption: Autophagy and epithelial–mesenchymal transition mechanisms of plant polysaccharides
  against lung injury. COVID-19 induces lung inflammation and fibrosis via ACE2 (angiotensin-converting
  enzyme II) receptor-mediated endocytosis into the airway epithelium. The ACE2-mediated
  PAK1 (p21-activated kinase) signaling pathway is a potential therapeutic target
  of plant polysaccharides. Plant polysaccharides affect MMP (metalloproteinase) levels
  in COVID-19 patients. Plant polysaccharides could act on MAPKs (mitogen-activated
  protein kinases), PI3K (phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase), and TGF-β1 (transforming
  growth factor beta) to stimulate fibroblast proliferation. Unknown links exist between
  COVID-19 and FoxO (forkhead box) transcription factor.
