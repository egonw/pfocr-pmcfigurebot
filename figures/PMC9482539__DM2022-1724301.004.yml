caption: Different clinical characteristics of liver cancer in cluster 1 and cluster
  2. The consensus expression acetylation regulation genes define cluster 1 and 2.
  (a) The heat map of clinical characteristics and gene expression in two clusters.
  (b) Kaplan-Meier survival curves for 374 liver cancer patients. Liver cancer patients
  in cluster 1 are marked with red, and those in cluster 2 are marked with lake blue.
  (c) GSEA of the genes in 2 clusters using the KEGG pathway. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01,
  and ∗∗∗p < 0.001.
