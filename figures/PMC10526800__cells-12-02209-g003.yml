caption: Roles of palmitoylation in modifying AKT, Wnt, and IGF-1 signaling. (a) For
  AKT signaling pathway, palmitoylation reduces mTOR stability, increases binding
  affinity of PCSK9 with PTEN, and prevents degradation of AKT. (b) For Wnt-mediated
  signaling, palmitoylation maintains plasma membrane localization of LRP6 and mediates
  CKAP4 translocation to the plasma membrane. (c) In IGF-1/IGF-1R signaling, palmitoylation
  mediates plasma membrane association of FLOT-1, an interacting protein of IGF-1R.
