caption: Aminoacylation of tRNACys transcript by M. jannaschii SepRS. (a) A scheme
  showing the indirect pathway for synthesis of Cys-tRNACys. (b) Sequence and cloverleaf
  structure of M. jannaschii tRNACys, where modification of m1G37 and mutations of
  U73G, G34C, C35U, A36G, G37A, A38G, G15C, and C48G are indicated by arrows. (c)
  Single turnover time courses of aminoacylation of the unmodified and m1G37-modified
  transcripts of M. jannaschii tRNACys by 10 μM SepRS, showing kapp of 0.15 s−1 and
  1.3 s−1, respectively. The term ± refers to standard deviation.
