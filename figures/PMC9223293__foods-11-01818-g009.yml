caption: The changes in fecal metabolites in HFD-fed mice after MFP, MFS and MFPS
  treatments (n = 4). (A) PCA score plot. (B) Cluster heatmap (color bars showing
  green to red indicate the relative content of metabolites, with red representing
  high expression and green representing low expression). (C) Pathway enrichment analysis
  (HFD vs. NCD). (D) Spearman’s correlation analysis between gut microbiota and different
  metabolites (color scale represents the Spearman r value, with red and blue indicating
  positive and negative correlations, respectively. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01). (E)
  Spearman’s correlation analysis between pharmacodynamic parameters and different
  metabolites (color scale represents the Spearman r value, with pink and green indicating
  positive and negative correlations, respectively. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01).
