figure_title: Fatostatin decreases GPX4 protein synthesis through the AKT/mTORC1/4EBP1
  axis
caption: A RNA-seq and RT‒PCR results showed that the mRNA level of GPX4 was not significantly
  different between the DMSO and fatostatin groups. B, C Western blotting was used
  to analyze the GPX4 protein levels after the cells were treated with or without
  fatostatin (20 μM) for 24 h and CHX (50 μM) for different durations (0, 4, 8, 12 h).
  D Western blot analysis of the GPX4 protein levels in the U87 cells treated with
  DMSO, CQ (lysosomal inhibitor, 10 μM), or MG132 (proteasomal inhibitor, 10 μM) with
  or without fatostatin (20 μM) treatment for 24 h. Lower panels show the statistical
  analysis of the data, n = 3. E, F The protein expression levels of AKT, p-AKT, mTOR,
  p-mTOR, 4EBP1, and p-4EBP1 in U87 and U251 cells after fatostatin treatment for
  24 h. G, H SC79 (AKT activator, 10 μM) reversed the relative protein expression
  levels of p-AKT, p-mTOR, p-4EBP1, and GPX4 in the U87 and U251 cells treated with
  fatostatin (20 μM) for 24 h. I, J MHY1485 (mTOR activator, 10 μM) reversed the changes
  in relative protein expression levels of p-mTOR, p-4EBP1, and GPX4 in the U87 and
  U251 cells treated with fatostatin (20 μM) for 24 h. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001;
  ns no significance.
