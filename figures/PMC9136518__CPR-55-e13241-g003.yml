caption: RR‐171 inhibited the G1/S phase transition and induced apoptosis in HCC cells.
  (A,B) Cell cycle distribution was measured in HCC cell lines treated with RR‐170
  or RR‐171 by flow cytometry assay. (C) Western blotting analysis of proteins (cyclinD1,
  cyclinE1, P21, p‐Rb, P53 and p‐P53) related to the cell cycle in HCC cells treated
  with RR‐170 or RR‐171. (D,E) Quantification of C from the Western blot experiments.
  (F,G) Flow cytometry analysis of cell apoptosis in HCC cell lines treated with RR‐170
  or RR‐171. (H) Western blotting analysis of proteins (caspase 3, cleaved caspase
  3, caspase 7, cleaved caspase 7, PARP and cleaved PARP) related to cell apoptosis
  in HCC cell lines treated with RR‐170 or RR‐171. (I,J) Quantification of H from
  the Western blotting experiments. The data are presented as the mean ± standard
  error of the mean (SEM). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
article_title: Tubulin‐binding peptide RR‐171 derived from human umbilical cord serum
  displays antitumor activity against hepatocellular carcinoma via inducing apoptosis
  and activating the NF‐kappa B pathway.
