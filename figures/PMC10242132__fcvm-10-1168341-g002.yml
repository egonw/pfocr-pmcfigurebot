caption: 'Changes in cardiac function and exercise tolerance of rats in each group
  before intragastric administration (i.e., baseline) and after intragastric administration
  (i.e., 4 week post). (A) Echocardiogram of rats in each group before and after intragastric
  administration. (B) Changes in the LVEF of rats in each group before and after intragastric
  administration. (C) Changes in the FS of rats in each group before and after intragastric
  administration. (D) Hemodynamic changes in rats in each group after intragastric
  administration. (E) Changes in the swimming time of exhaustion of rats in each group
  after intragastric administration. At baseline, the sham-operated group compared
  with the rest of the rats, △△P < 0.01. 4 week post, compared with the sham-operated
  group, ##P < 0.01, compared with the model group, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.'
