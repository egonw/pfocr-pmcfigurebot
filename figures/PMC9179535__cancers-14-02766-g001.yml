caption: 'Metabolic screen of multiple myeloma cells. (A) Schematic for metabolic
  screening targeting glycolysis pathway in MM cells. (B) Assay for metabolic efficiency
  of compounds from NCI-drug library on RPMI8226 and U266 MM cells; HEK293 cells were
  used to determine the toxicity of the compounds. Each point represents a single
  compound from the library; the assay was performed in duplicate for reproducibility
  (Vo = vorinostat, Vi = vismodegib, Pa = palbociclib, Po = ponatinib, Bi = binimetinib).
  Cells were incubated with the drug compounds for 72 h for the assay. (C) Schematic
  diagram of the glycolysis pathway for the enzymatic links. (D,E) The top ten selected
  drug candidates were screened for inhibition of glycolytic genes by qPCR. The drug
  treatment was for 12 h on RPMI8226 cells. (F) The top 5 candidates were further
  screened for inhibition in lactate production using a lactate assay kit on RPMI8226
  cells; drug treatment was for 24 h. Data are presented as mean ± SEM; t-test: ***
  p < 0.001. (G) Venn diagram shows ponatinib was the best candidate compound for
  glycolysis gene and lactate production inhibition. (H) HK2 and GPI signals were
  analyzed in normal and MM cells in cancer patients. The patient data were obtained
  from the R2 platform (hgserver1.amc.nl) (GEO ID: GSE2658). N = normal tissue; T
  = tumor. Data are plotted as mean with the shaded distributions; * p < 0.05, ***
  p < 0.001, provided by R2 platform search engine (via one-way ANOVA on ranks). (I)
  Kaplan–Meier overall survival plots of MM patients with respect to HK2 and GPI RNA
  message levels are shown. Significance p-values are indicated in the figure, provided
  by R2 platform search engine (hgserver1.amc.nl) (GEO ID: GSE2658) (via one-way ANOVA
  on ranks).'
