caption: Il6 deficiency impairs the upregulation of pluripotency genes during reprogramming(A)
  Principal-component analysis (PCA) of gene expression dynamics of 38,019 genes during
  reprogramming of Il6+/+ and Il6−/− B cells, showing biological duplicates and average
  trajectories.(B) Heatmap of unsupervised K-means clustering of genes differentially
  expressed between Il6+/+ and Il6−/− cells (p < 0.01) at different times during reprogramming,
  showing biological duplicates. Representative examples of genes within each cluster
  are shown on the right.(C) Gene expression changes (RNA-seq) of pluripotency, trophectoderm,
  B cell, and myeloid signature genes during reprogramming of Il6+/+ and Il6−/− B
  cells. Thin lines represent average values of biological duplicates for each gene,
  thick lines the mean and shades the SD. Statistically significant differences between
  Il6+/+ and Il6−/− cells are indicated by p values determined using two-way ANOVA
  and Šídák’s multiple comparison tests (ns, not significant). Signature genes are
  listed in .(D) Expression kinetics (RNA-seq) of pluripotency and trophectoderm signature
  genes, comparing C/EBPα pulsed B cells (C/EBPα + OSKM) with non-pulsed cells (OSKM)
  (RNA-seq by ). Lines represent average values of biological duplicates for each
  gene, centered around a thicker mean line for the whole signature and shades denoting
  SD. Statistical significance is determined using two-way ANOVA and Šídák’s multiple
  comparison tests. Signature genes are listed in .(E) Heatmap of pluripotency and
  trophectoderm signature genes’ expression obtained from single cells at day 8 of
  reprogramming (), with values of individual cells ordered according to their similarity
  to ESCs.(F) Correlation plots between Il6ra-Il6 gene expression pairs in single
  cells at various time points during reprogramming. Pearson’s correlation coefficients
  (R), p values (P), and tendency lines are depicted in each plot. Correlation coefficients
  are color coded in brown and red, respectively, corresponding to zero and negative
  values.(G) Model of the role of C/EBPα and the IL-6 pathway during the C/EBPα-enhanced
  reprogramming of B cells into pluripotent and TE-like cells. See also .
