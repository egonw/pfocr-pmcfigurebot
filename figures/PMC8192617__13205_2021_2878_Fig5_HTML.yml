caption: Withaferin A blocks the TGF-β1 pathway. Western blots displaying the activity
  of TGF-β signalling in withaferin A treated KLE cells. The activity of TGF-β1, TGF-β2,
  p-Smad2 and p-Smad3 were downregulated and Smad2 and Smad3 remained almost constant.
  The experiments were performed in triplicate
