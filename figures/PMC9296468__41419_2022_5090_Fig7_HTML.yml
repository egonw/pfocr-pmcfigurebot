figure_title: High level of GDF15 glycoprotein expression is associated with poor
  survival of cancer patients
caption: A GDF15 level was determined by ELISA in serum samples from normal and patients
  with BPH, Localized PCa, or mCRPC. One-way ANOVA, p < 0.05. Data are expressed as
  mean ± std. B Prostate cancer patient overall survival curve in relation to GDF15
  expression level was calculated using data from the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive
  Analysis (EGPIA) website. C Overall survival curves of lower grade glioma (LGG),
  mesothelioma (MESO), and uveal melanoma (UVM) patients in relation to GDF15 expression
  level were obtained from the EGPIA website. P-values were calculated using log-rank
  test; meta-analysis survival plots were generated using KM plotter. D Schematic
  graph depicts GDF15 inhibition of EGFR and N-glycosylation of GDF15 disables its
  suppressive effect on the EGFR pathway in CRPC cells.
