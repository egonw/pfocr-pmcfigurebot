caption: 'Model IV: Ultrasensitivity arising from positive autoregulation of NRF2
  through p62-mediated sequestration and autophagy of KEAP1. (A) Structure of Model
  IV, containing basal synthesis of NRF2 (k1), KEAP1-independent NRF2 degradation
  (k20), KEAP1-dependent NRF2 degradation which can be inhibited by stressor S (k2,
  Kd2), NRF2-induced synthesis of p62 (k3), basal degradation of p62 (k4), synthesis
  of KEAP1 (k5), p62-independent degradation of KEAP1 (k6), association (k7) and dissociation
  (k8) between KEAP1 and p62, and autophagic degradation of KEAP1-p62 complex (k9).
  (B) Simulated steady-state dose-response of NRF2, KEAP1, and p62 variables as indicated,
  exhibiting ultrasensitivity. (C) Ultrasensitivity of NRF2 when (i) the p62 autoregulatory
  loop and p62-mediated KEAP1 sequestration and degradation are intact, (ii) p62-mediated
  KEAP1 autophagy is absent (by setting k9=k6, and k5=1.27573E-4 so that free KEAP1
  remains at the same basal level as in the intact model), and (iii) p62 induction
  by NRF2 is disabled such that p62 remains at the same basal level as in the intact
  model.'
