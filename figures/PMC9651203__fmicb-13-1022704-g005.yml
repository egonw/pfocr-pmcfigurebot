caption: 'Lists of the total number of proteins immunoprecipitated by DnaK-V5 and
  identified by mass spectrometry analysis in each cell type that are part of the
  DNA repair Reactome pathway (R-HSA-73894). (A) A total of 34 proteins were identified
  (see , ). The histogram indicates the number of hits for each cell type. (B) A Venn
  diagram visualizes the number of shared and unique proteins obtained from each cell
  type. Of these, 7 proteins were shared among all five human cell lines analyzed.
  (C) The Circos plot shows the overlaps between the proteins from theDNA repair pathway.
  On the outside, each arc represents the identity of the 5 cell lines (red for AGS,
  blue for H446, green for HCT116, purple for PC3 and orange for SH-SY5Y); on the
  inside, each arc represents a protein list, where each protein has a spot on the
  arc. The dark orange color of the inside arc represents the DNA repair proteins
  that appear in multiple lists and the light orange color of the inside arc represents
  DNA repair proteins that are unique to that cell type list. Purple lines link the
  proteins that are shared by multiple cell types. The greater the number of purple
  links and the longer are the dark orange arcs. This implies a greater overlap among
  the protein from each cell line. A full list of the total 34 isolated proteins from
  the DNA repair Reactome pathway is given in . (D) Table indicating the membership
  of the seven proteins in the 4 DNA repair pathways of Base Excision Repair (BER),
  Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER), Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) and Homologous
  Recombination (HR). (E) Western blot from DnaK immunoprecipitation comparing the
  five cancer cell lines. On the left side, the Molecular Weight (MW) Marker is indicated.
  On the right side, the name and MW of each validated protein are given. For each
  of the 5 cell types, three samples were loaded: the immunoprecipitated DnaK-transfected
  lysate with the antibody isotype control, the immunoprecipitated DnaK-transfected
  lysate with anti-V5 antibody and 2.5% load of the DnaK-transfected lysate used for
  the immunoprecipitations.'
