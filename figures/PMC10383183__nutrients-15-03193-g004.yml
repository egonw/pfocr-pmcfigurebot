caption: Effect of PBE on MAPK activation in BMMs. BMMs were cultured with RANKL (100
  ng/mL) and M-CSF (30 ng/mL), with or without PBE (50 μg/mL), for 5, 15, 30, and
  60 min. (A) Protein expression levels were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-ERK,
  p-ERK, p38, p-p38, JNK, and p-JNK antibodies. (B) Band intensities were quantified
  using ImageJ software. Bars labeled with different superscripts indicate significant
  differences (# p < 0.05 vs. RANKL-non treated group; ** p < 0.005 vs. control).
  Data are expressed as the mean ± SD of at least three independent experiments (n
  = 3).
