caption: Intercommunication between HIF, NF-κB, and STAT pathways during hypoxia.
  Hypoxia induces NF-κB activity through CaMK2 and the presence of TAK and IKK, leading
  to the sumoylation of IκBα. TNF-α also increases HIF-1α levels through the NF-κB
  pathway. Hypoxia through HIF-1α also induces phosphorylation of the inhibitory IκBα
  for its degradation and thus activation of NF-κB. Moreover, hypoxia inactivates
  the PHD hydroxylation over IKKβ, which conducts IKKβ to degradation; instead, IKKβ
  phosphorylates IκBα to finally activate NF-κB. STAT3 induces HIF-1α expression and
  avoids its degradation, even independently of hypoxia, inducing gene transcription.
  STAT3 and HIF-1α interact and recruit coactivators to induce gene transcription,
  including VEGF. Hypoxia induces the expression of Src, which leads to STAT3 activation
  and, in consequence, HIF-1α stabilization. Akt is also activated by STAT3, and as
  feedback, induces HIF-1α expression. miR17 and miR20a inhibit differentiation and
  STAT3 activation. However, HIF-1α inhibits these miRNAs and avoids their effects
  (see more details in the main text).
