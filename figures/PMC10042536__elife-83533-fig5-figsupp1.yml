  pathway
caption: '(A) Lethally irradiated wild-type (WT) mice were reconstituted with Rag1-deficient
  Igh-tg (red) or Artemis (Dclrec1)-deficient Igh-tg bone marrow. Histograms of LTα
  and LTβ expression in Rag1-deficient Igh-tg pre-B (red) and Artemis (Dclrec1)-deficient
  Igh-tg pre-B cells (blue). (B–E) Lethally irradiated Il7GFP/+ LeprCreCre/+ Ltbrflfl/fl
  (green) and Il7GFP/+ Lepr+/+ Ltbrflfl/fl (gray) mice were reconstituted with bone
  marrow from Artemis (Dclrec1)-deficient Igh-tg mice. (B) Il7-GFP expression in MSCs.
  (C) Developing B cell numbers in bone marrow. (D) Neutrophil and monocyte numbers.
  (E) Ter119+CD71+ immature RBC numbers. Bars indicate mean, circles depict individual
  mice. (F) Histograms of LTα expression in B-ALL cells treated with Etoposide (ETP)
  at the indicated concentrations in vitro. (G) LTα geometric mean fluorescence in
  cells described in panel F plotted as percent of untreated cells. (H) Geo. mean
  intensity of LTα expression in acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs) treated in vitro
  with and without Etoposide and IKKβ inhibitor IMD 3504 for 16 hr. Data are representative
  of two independent experiments. *p<0.05; **p<0.005; unpaired, two-sided, Student’s
  t test; panel H column A versus B Mann–Whitney test; #p<0.05; ####p<0.0001.'
