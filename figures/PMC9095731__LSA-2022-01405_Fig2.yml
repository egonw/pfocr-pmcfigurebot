figure_title: Comparative analysis of PLWHART and PLWHEC
caption: (A) Relative reservoir quantification using total HIV-1 DNA in PLWHART (n
  = 17) and PLWHEC (n = 14). (B) MA plot showing differential gene expression results
  of PLWHART versus PLWHEC. Negative log2-fold change values represent down-regulation
  and positive values represent up-regulation in PLWHART. Grey-colored dots denote
  non-significant genes (adjusted P > 0.05). (C) Heatmap showing the expression pattern
  of significantly regulated genes between PLWHART and PLWHEC (adjusted P < 0.05).
  Column annotation denotes cohort, age, gender, and duration of combination antiretroviral
  therapy of the corresponding samples. Row and column clustering was performed using
  Euclidian distance. (D) Gene set enrichment analysis results using MSigDB hallmark
  gene set between PLWHART versus PLWHEC. A positive enrichment score represents up-regulation
  and negative score represents down-regulation in PLWHART. Statistically significant
  pathways are labeled and highlighted by asterisk. Bubble size is relative to the
  adjusted P-values of the pathways. *Indicates FDR < 0.2. (E) Schematic visualization
  of the five complexes of OXPHOS pathway. The heat-map shows expression pattern of
  genes belonging to OXPHOS pathway in PLWHART and PLWHEC. Column annotation denotes
  OXPHOS pathway complexes and row annotation denotes the cohort. The bottom annotation
  shows the log2 fold change values of the genes. Red color represents up-regulation
  and green color represents down-regulation of the gene in PLWHART compared with
  PLWHEC.
