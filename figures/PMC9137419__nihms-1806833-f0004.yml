figure_title: Lipid-droplet formation under low pH is affected by inhibition of downstream
  signaling of PL-C and PI3Kinase/Akt pathway
caption: (A) Schematic showing signaling through OGR1 receptor.(B) LD accumulation
  is inhibited by pharmacological inhibitors of PL-C, edelfosine (5 μM), or U73122
  (2.5 μM) under low pH in MCF7 cells.(C) MCF7 cells treated with YM254890, an inhibitor
  of Gq/11-coupled GPCR signaling, affected LD accumulation. PLIN2 (red), Nile Red
  (green), and DAPI (blue).(D) Triglyceride levels from cells grown in pH 7.4, 6.5,
  or 6.5 media along with inhibitors of OGR1 downstream signal mediators PL-C and
  Gq/11. Acidic-pH-induced increases in TG levels were abrogated by inhibitor treatments.
  p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA analysis for each cell line.(E) Acidic pH induced OGR1-mediated
  Gq/11 activation as seen by IP1 assay. IP1 levels in OGR1-overexpressing MCF7 cells
  were higher at pH 6.5 compared with 8 and were inhibited by Gq/11 inhibitor (T test,
  p < 0.0001).(F) OGR1-depleted cells did not induce IP1 upon low-pH treatment, and
  this was not significantly altered by Gq/11 inhibitor. t test, not significant.(G)
  Acidic pH induces Akt phosphorylation (residues S473 and T308) and phosphorylation
  of NFkB, the downstream target of Akt activation, as seen by western blot analyses.(H)
  Inhibition of PI3K using GDC0941 (0.5 μM) or Akt inhibition by MK2206 (0.5 μM) resulted
  in significantly lower levels of LDs under low pH in MCF7 cells.(I) Acid-induced
  Akt phosphorylation (S473) was abrogated in OGR1-depleted cells, as seen by western
  blot analysis.(J) Ectopic expression of OGR1 rescued acid-induced LD accumulation
  in OGR1-depleted cells. OGR1-KO cells were transfected with either empty vector
  control or Myc-tagged OGR1 and subsequently induced with pH 7.4 or 6.5 media (Nile
  Red, green; Myc, red; DAPI, blue).(K) Akt phosphorylation (S473) was rescued in
  OGR1-depleted cells by ectopic expression of OGR1.(L) Akt inhibition is selectively
  cytotoxic at acidic pH. Akt inhibitor MK0026 treatment decreased growth rate in
  low-pH culture conditions compared with neutral pH. p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA.
