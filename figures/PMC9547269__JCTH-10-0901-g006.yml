figure_title: Enriched KEGG signaling pathways in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients
  (n=371) with high NR6A1 expression
caption: HCC patients were divided into NR6A1 high-expression (n=185) and low-expression
  (n=186) groups by to median expression of NR6A1 mRNA. (A) Enrichment of cell cycle
  in the NR6A1 high-expression group. (B) Enrichment of mTOR signaling pathway in
  the NR6A1 high-expression group. (C) Enrichment of WNT signaling pathway in the
  NR6A1 high-expression group. (D) Enrichment of ERBB signaling pathway in the NR6A1
  high-expression group.
