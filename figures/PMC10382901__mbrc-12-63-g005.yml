caption: Schematic diagram of working model. In the absence of androgen, the SHH signaling
  pathway is turned on leading to an upregulation of the downstream effector GLI3.
  In the presence of wildtype MED12 (left), a constraint is placed on GLI3 signaling
  thereby leading to regulated GLI3 target gene expression and a subsequent block
  to progression towards CRPC. When MED12 is either downregulated or mutated (right),
  the constraint on GLI3 is lifted thereby leading to hyperactivated GLI3 target gene
  expression and subsequent progression to CRPC.

  cancer through modulation of GLI3 signaling.
