caption: Expression of ARL4C in normal renal cells and ccRCC cell lines and establishment
  of ARL4C knockdown ccRCC cell lines. (a) ARL4C mRNA expression in normal kidney
  cells (HK-2) and different ccRCC cell lines (786-O, ACHN, and A498) was determined
  using qRT-PCR and quantified as a histogram. (b-c) Western blot showing the amount
  of ARL4C protein in HK-2, 786-O, ACHN, and A498 cells, represented quantitatively
  for the screened cell lines as a histogram. (d) qRT-PCR determination of the knockdown
  efficiency after transfection of negative control small interference (si-NC) and
  knockdown ARL4C small interference (si-ARL4C) into ACHN and 786-O cells. (e-f) Western
  blot of the expression of ARL4C protein in the si-NC and si-ARL4C groups in 786-O
  and ACHN cell lines, shown quantitatively as a histogram. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001.
