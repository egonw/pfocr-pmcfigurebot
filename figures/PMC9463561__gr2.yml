caption: Transient silencing and overexpression of circBRWD1 significantly inhibited
  the proliferation of malignant transformed cells(A) The KEGG website was used to
  conduct pathway enrichment analysis on circBRWD1. (B) FISH confirmed the subcellular
  localization of circBRWD1 in the cell; the nucleus was stained with DAPI, and circBRWD1
  was labeled with a specific probe labeled with GFP. (C) The ratio of circBRWD1 expression
  in the nucleus and cytoplasm of BEAS-2B cells was determined; U6 served as a nuclear
  marker, while GAPDH was a cytoplasmic marker. (D) The efficiency of silencing or
  overexpressing circBRWD1 was measured after transient transfection with circBRWD1
  siRNAs or the circBRWD1 overexpression vector into BEAS-2B-As cells. (E) After splicing
  and overexpressing circBRWD1, the viability of BEAS-2B-As cells was measured by
  CCK-8 assay. (F and G) EdU experiments measured the proliferation of BEAS-2B-As;
  cell nuclei were stained with DAPI. EdU/DAPI indicated the cell proliferation ability.
  (H–K) Flow cytometry was used to detect the apoptosis and cell cycle of BEAS-2B-As.
