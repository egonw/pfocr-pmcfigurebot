caption: Abundance of sulfur metabolism genes in Porcelana hot spring metagenomes.
  Genes from the sulfur cycle are grouped based on the pathway ((A,C) for ASR; (B,D)
  for DSR; and (E) for Sox) and at which step of the sulfur cycle reaction they are
  involved ((A,B) for sulfide to sulfite; (C,D) for sulfite to sulfate; (E) for sulfate
  to thiosulfate). Orders with their respective phyla are shown on the Y-axis and
  samples are shown on the X-axis. The reads counts are normalized by quantiles and
  Log2-transformed for metagenomes from the three sampled temperatures (48, 58, and
  66 °C). Analyzed genes are listed in . * C denote “Candidatus”.
