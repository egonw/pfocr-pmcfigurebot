caption: 'Role of YTHDF2 silencing in M1/M2 macrophage polarization. (a, b) YTHDF2
  silencing efficiency in M0 macrophages was determined through qRT-PCR as well as
  WB. Mock: transfection reagent-transfected cells; siNC: NC-siRNA-treated cells;
  #n (n = 1/2/3) siRNA: YTHDF2 siRNA-treated cells. (c, d) M0 macrophages were subject
  to transfection using YTHDF2 siRNA (Si) or NC-siRNA (NC), followed by activation
  using LPS+ INF-γ or IL-4, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and iNOS levels within M1 cells, together
  with IL-10, TGF-β, ARG-1, and FIZZ within M2 macrophages were determined through
  qRT-PCR, with GAPDH being the endogenous reference. (e) IL-6 and TNF-α production
  in M1 macrophages were determined by ELISA before (NC) or after YTHDF2 knockdown
  (Si). (f) IL-10 and TGF-β levels within M2 cells were determined by ELISA before
  (NC) or after YTHDF2 knockdown (Si). (g) CD86 and CD16/32 protein levels within
  M1 macrophages were detected through FACS before (NC) or after YTHDF2 knockdown
  (Si). (h) CD206 and DECTIN-1 levels within M2 macrophages were determined through
  FACS before (NC) or after YTHDF2 knockdown (Si). Data are demonstrated by mean ±
  S.E.M. (n = 3). ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01.'
