caption: A schematic representation of the OFF and ON state of the Wnt pathway. (a)
  A scheme of the Wnt OFF state. The lack of Wnt ligands leads to the degradation
  of β-catenin, YAP/TAZ. Consequently, the level of β-catenin and YAP/TAZ in the cytoplasm
  is low, and they cannot enter the nucleus and activate their target genes. (b) A
  scheme of the Wnt ON state. Wnt ligands interacting with Frizzled inhibit the degradation
  of β-catenin and YAP/TAZ which accumulates in the cytoplasm and can enter the nucleus
  and interact with TCF/LEF and activate Wnt-responsive genes. See text for details.
