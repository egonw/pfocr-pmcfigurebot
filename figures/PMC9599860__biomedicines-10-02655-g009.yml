caption: 'APP processing and effect of secretase and caveolin-1 inhibitors after PTS.
  Newly synthesized APP, BACE1, α-, and γ-secretases (1) are transported to the plasma
  membrane (2). Caveolae provide a platform for the regulation of APP processing.
  APP physically interacts with caveolin-1, providing its high concentration on the
  cytoplasmic membrane. APP is cleaved at the plasma membrane by α-secretase releasing
  sAPPα. After APP is cleaved by α-secretase, sAPPα is released into the extracellular
  space in a soluble form, while CTFα remains bound to the membrane where it is cleaved
  in lysosomes or further cleaved by γ-secretase. Most of APP, BACE1, and γ-secretase
  are internalized into early endosomes from the cell surface back into the cell and
  degraded in lysosomes (3). Delivery of APP or reduction of its internalization from
  the cell surface by binding to caveolin-1 promotes non-amyloidogenic APP processing.
  Amyloidogenic processing begins with the internalization of APP to endosomes. β-secretase,
  located on the endosomal membrane, cleaves APP at low pH into two forms in the lipid
  bilayer: the soluble fragment of APP (sAPPβ) and the membrane-bound β-carboxyl terminal
  fragment (CTFβ) (4). Further cleavage of CTFβ by γ-secretase produces Aβ monomers
  and the APP intracellular domain (AICD). The fate of APP along the amyloidogenic
  or non-amyloidogenic pathway largely depends on the co-localization of APP and secretases
  that can be influenced by caveolin-1, PTS causes an increase in the level of C-
  and N-terminal fragments of APP, proteins of the γ-secretase complex of presenilin-1
  (PS1) and nicastrin (NCT) and Aβ with a decrease in the expression of ADAM10 and
  caveolin-1 (CAV-1). Decreased expression of caveolin1 by administering its inhibitor
  daidzein shifts APP processing towards Aβ synthesis that leads to hyperactivation
  of astrocytes. The administration of the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT reduces the
  amount of PTS damage by reducing the level of apoptotic cell death in the peri-infarction
  area.'
