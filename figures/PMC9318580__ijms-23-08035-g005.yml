caption: Zn2+ activates the ERK/P38 signaling pathway and causes mitochondrial damage
  in HEK293 α-synuclein-DsRed cells. (a–e) HEK293 α-synuclein-DsRed cells were treated
  with 10 or 75 μM ZnSO4 for 12 h. The p-ERK1 (a,b), p-ERK2 (a,c), p-p38 (a,d), cleaved
  caspase 3 (a,f) levels and the total protein levels of ERK1/2, p38, caspase 3 and
  expression levels of cytochrome C (a,e) were determined via Western blotting with
  β-actin as an internal control ((a), representative pictures; (b–f), quantification).
  (g) The mRNA expression levels of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I and
  III subunits were determined via qRT-PCR using GAPDH as the internal controls. (h)
  JC-1 staining was used to detect the changes in mitochondrial membrane potential
  after HEK293 α-synuclein-DsRed cells were treated with 75 μM ZnSO4 for 12 h. Color
  dye changes reversibly from red to green as mitochondrial membranes become depolarized.
  All data from at least three independent experiments are represented as the means
  ± SEM. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 with respect to the control group.
