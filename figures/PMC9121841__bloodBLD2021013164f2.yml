caption: Oncoplot of putative drivers in LGL leukemia. (A) Seven different driver
  analysis tools identified 15 gene variants with putative driver roles present in
  at least 3 LGL leukemia samples. Each row represents 1 of the 15 putative drivers,
  whereas the columns represent individual patients. LGL disease cohorts are color
  coded at the top. Type of alteration in putative driver genes is indicated by the
  colored boxes, which are defined under “Alterations,” and gray indicates WT. The
  top bar graph shows the number of amplification and deletion events. Right bar graph
  shows the distribution of variants for a given gene across the 2 LGL cohorts. Bottom
  annotations represent clinical phenotypes of individual patients, with color definitions
  found in the rightmost annotation. ANC values above 1.5k/µl and HGB values above
  12 are annotated as “Normal,” and anything below is “Low.” Treatment indicates if
  patients were on LGL treatment (methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, or cyclosporine)
  at the time of sample acquisition. Unknown values are colored in gray. (B) Kyoto
  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis of somatic mutations observed
  in the cohort using SLAPenrich. The size of the nodes represents the number of genes
  in the cohort observed in the pathway. The color of the nodes represents the percent
  of those genes that uniquely belong in each pathway. The thickness of the edges
  represents the Jaccard index between the nodes.
