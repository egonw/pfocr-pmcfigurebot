figure_title: PA-MSHA induced M1 macrophage polarization by targeting TLR5 and activating
  the NF-κB signaling pathway
caption: A Confirmation of NF-κB, SRC, STAT1 changes by Western-Blot. B–C NF-κB blockade
  in THP-1 cells suppressed expression of TNF-α and IL-6. D mRNA change of TLRs in
  THP-1 derived macrophages after treatment with PA-MSHA for 6 hours, 12 hours and
  24 hours. E–F Inhibitor of TLR5 (TH1020, 5 μM) suppressed the expression of TNF-α
  and IL-6. P-M is short for PA-MSHA. (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P
  < 0.0001.).
