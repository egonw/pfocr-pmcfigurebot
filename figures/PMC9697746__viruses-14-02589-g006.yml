caption: Copy choice model for repair of the M segment. (A) The new 3′ end is derived
  from the l segment when it is used as a template, and the continuation of synthesis
  shifts to the m plus strand. L synthesis then commences once again and continues
  to completion. (B) Pathway B is more complex in that transcription of the new plus
  strands displaces the chimeric minus strand from its original m template. The original
  template would then reinitiate minus-strand synthesis, which proceeds normally.
