caption: PTP1B and Cdk3 depletion impairs cell proliferation. (A) GB cells were transfected
  with siRNAs targeting PTP1B or Cdk3, and the expression of both proteins was assessed
  by immunoblot. GAPDH was used as loading control. (B) GB cells were synchronized
  at G0 by serum deprivation and incubated 3 h with vehicle, claramine 2 µM, trodusquemine
  2 µM, or transfected with nontargeting siRNAs or siRNAs targeting PTP1B or Cdk3.
  Cells were counted every 24 h. Proliferation of LN229, U87-MG and U251 cells is
  represented as mean ± SE of three independent experiments. (C) Ptp1b +/+ and Ptp1b
  −/− MEFs were synchronized at G0 by serum deprivation and incubated 3 h with vehicle,
  claramine 2 µM, trodusquemine 2 µM. Cells were counted every 24 h. Proliferation
  of Ptp1b +/+ and Ptp1b −/− MEFs is represented as mean ± SE of three independent
  experiments.
