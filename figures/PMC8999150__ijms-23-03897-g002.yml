caption: Schematic diagrams of the HCV entry into hepatocyte (a) and the replication,
  assembly, and secretion of HCV (b). (a) HCV entry into hepatocytes is a sequential
  process in which multiple factors, including glycosaminoglycan (GAG), low-density
  lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), CD81, tight
  junction proteins, claudin-1 (CLDN1), and occludin (OCLN), as well as Niemannâ€“Pick
  C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), are involved [,,]. The process starts with the binding of the
  lipoviral particle (LVP) to GAG and LDLR, followed by the interactions with SR-BI,
  CD81, CLDN1, and OCLN, leading to viral internalization in cholesterol-enriched
  microdomains (lipid rafts) of the membranes via a clathrin-mediated endocytosis;
  (b) HCV viral proteins induce rearrangement of ER membranes and form replication
  complexes []. Localization of the HCV polyprotein to cholesterol-enriched membrane
  fractions is required for the polyprotein cleavage [], and the replication complexes
  are associating with cholesterol-enriched domains []. New viral genomic RNA is synthesized
  by the replication complexes assembled by non-structural (NS) proteins of HCV, and
  the newly produced HCV core protein is translocated to LDs. Virion assembly occurs
  on core protein-enriched LDs and is associated by ApoE. Packaging of the capsid
  takes place with viral budding into the ER lumen at VLDL synthesis sites, mediated
  by microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP). ApoB is lipidated by the MTP
  to generate VLDL precursors, which further fuse with ER luminal ApoE-bound LDs to
  form VLDL []. The matured HCV is associated with VLDL, in the form of LVP, and secreted
  through the VLDL secretion pathway. Graphics in this figure were created with BioRender.com
