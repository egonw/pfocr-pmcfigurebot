caption: Growth-inhibitory effect of MK2206 2HCl on OSCC cell lines. (a) MK2206 2HCl
  treatment inhibited CAL27 cell proliferation, determined by MTT assay. (b) MK2206
  2HCl treatment inhibited SCC25 cell proliferation, determined by MTT assay. (c)
  Colony formation assay showed that MK2206 2HCl inhibited colony formation of CAL27
  cells. (d) The colony formation assay showed that MK2206 2HCl inhibited colony formation
  of SCC25 cells. All data are presented as the mean ± SD. ∗∗P < 0.01 as compared
  with the control group.
