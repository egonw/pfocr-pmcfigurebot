caption: 'The level of Dp-specific immunoglobulin in serum and cytokine levels in
  BALF. (A) Serum IgE, Dp-specific IgE, IgG1 (at serum dilution of 1:1000), and IgG2a
  (at serum dilution of 1:10) were evaluated after the final administration of Dp.
  (B) Levels of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 were measured in the BALF by ELISA. Data shown
  are the mean Â± standard deviation (n = 7). ** p < 0.01 vs. CTL, *** p < 0.001 vs.
  CTL, # p < 0.05, ### p < 0.001.'
