caption: For full reaction, gene list, and list of compound abbreviations see Supplementary
  Tables –. Green boxes indicate a reaction (and its reference number in Supplementary
  Table ) that could be linked to a gene with the predicted metabolic function. Black
  arrows with solid lines indicate a reaction that could be identified, associated
  smaller arrows with colored dots indicate consumed, and generated reaction substrates
  and products are indicated in the key at the bottom left. Black arrows with dotted
  lines indicate flow of metabolites to other pathways or reactions. Gray arrows with
  dotted lines and gray boxes indicate reactions that were searched for and could
  not be identified. Amino acids are in red text to highlight their locations throughout
  the figure. Metabolites in blue text indicate hubs for carbon derived from amino
  acid catabolism. For ease of viewing the reactions of glycolysis, the pentose phosphate
  pathway, and the TCA cycle have been highlighted with beige, red, and orange backgrounds.
  The upper panel is a blow up of the electron transport reactions showing predicted
  organizations of subunits in each complex. Reference numbers for each subunit can
  be found in the larger figure panel, and colors of subunits are the same as those
  used in that figure panel. Transparent HAO-QRED indicates a putative/proposed functionality.
  Black arrows with dotted lines indicate putative reactions. Protein subunits with
  solid color but dotted borders indicate a protein was found but functionality is
  unclear.
