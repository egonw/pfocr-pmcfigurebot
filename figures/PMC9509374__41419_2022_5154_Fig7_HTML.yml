figure_title: miR-760 is involved in autophagy and PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling via targeting
  HM13
caption: A, B Inhibitor control (inh-NC), miR-760 inhibitor (inh-760), miR-760 inhibitor
  and negative control (inh-760+si-NC) or miR-760 inhibitor and siRNA (inh-760+si-HM13)
  was transfected into SUM1315 and ZR-75-1 cell lines, respectively. The cell proliferation
  abilities were evaluated via CCK-8 (A), as well as colony formation assay (B). C,
  D SUM1315 and ZR-75-1 cell lines were divided into four groups, inhibitor control
  (inh-NC) group, miR-760 inhibitor (inh-760) group, miR-760 inhibitor and negative
  control (inh-760+si-NC) group or miR-760 inhibitor and siRNA (inh-760+si-HM13) group.
  The metastasis abilities were detected by the wound healing assays (C) and the transwell
  assays (D). E Western blot was aimed to evaluate the protein expression of genes
  related to autophagy and PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling in rescue experiments. Data were
  shown as mean ± SD, *p < 0.01, **p < 0.01.
