caption: 'Effect of arbutin on the migration of HaCAT and DFL cells after induced
  by heat stress. Transwell chamber for determining the migration of HaCAT and DFL
  cells with solvent and different concentrations of arbutin (10, 50, and 100 μmol/L)
  after 4°C-50 minutes heat stress (a). Statistically compared the number of cells
  that have migrated (n = 3) (b). P value was calculated by one-way ANOVA. ∗∗∗P <
  0.001 vs. the control group; ###P < 0.001 vs. the solvent group.'
