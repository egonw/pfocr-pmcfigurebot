figure_title: Dusp1 overexpression impacts lysosome biology
caption: Dusp1 was overexpressed in NK92 cells, a well-accepted NK cell line. The
  created cell line and its control were examined to better understand pathways regulated
  by Dusp1.(A/B) Top 15 pathways enriched by the differentially expressed genes that
  were either upregulated (A) or downregulated (B) in Dusp1 oe cells is presented
  as dot plot. Each dot is a pathway labeled on y-axis, the size of the dot is scaled
  to the number of DE genes overlapping with the pathway and are plotted on negative
  log 10 q value scale on the x-axis.(C-E) Dusp1 overexpressing NK cells and their
  control were examined for intracellular Lamp-1 expression using flow cytometry (C,
  n=6, unpaired t-Test), LAMP1 and TFEB mRNA expression (n=3, unpaired t-Test), and
  TEM imaging (n=3 pooled, scale bar 1Î¼m).(F) Variables important in predicting the
  control and Dusp1 overexpressing cells. The VIP score of the indicated proteins
  on the y axis and their mean expression in control and Dusp1 oe cells on the x axis
  is presented.(G/H) Galectin 3/8 expression were analyzed in both cell lines using
  flow cytometry in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132. (n=10, G-Mann
  Whitney test, H-unpaired t-Test) (Significance was established when a p-value <
  0.05 was present comparing individual groups; *indicates significance between groups)
