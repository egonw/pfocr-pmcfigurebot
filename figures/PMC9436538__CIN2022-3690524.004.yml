caption: Ursolic acid reduces the apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells after
  unilateral ureteral obstruction in rats TUNEL staining is used to mark apoptotic
  cells; DAPI staining is used to mark normal cell nuclei; MERGE represents the combination
  of the two; observed under a fluorescence microscope, normal cell nuclei are blue,
  and apoptotic cell nuclei are green; (a) the apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial
  cells on the 8th day after operation in each group of rats; (b) the Western blot
  of caspase-3 and caspase-8 apoptotic proteins in each group of rats; (c) the statistical
  graph of the apoptosis index of renal tubular epithelial cells in each group (the
  percentage of the number of apoptotic cells in the total number of tubular epithelial
  cells is used as the apoptotic index (AI)) (mean ± standard deviation), n = 6);
  (d) the statistical graph of the apoptotic protein caspase-3 mRNA in each group;
  (e) the statistical graph of the apoptotic protein caspase-8 mRNA in each group;
  (f) the statistical graph of the expression level of the apoptotic protein Caspase-3;
  (g) the statistical graph of the expression level of the apoptotic protein caspase-8;
  ∗means P < 0.05; ∗∗means P < 0.01; ∗∗∗means P < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗means P < 0.0001.
