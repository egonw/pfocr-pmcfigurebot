caption: 'MDA-MB-231-derived EVs promoted BC cell drug resistance in vivo by carrying
  miR-887-3p. Parental MCF-7 and MCF-7/Dox cells stably expressed or transfected were
  inoculated subcutaneously into BALB/c nude mice at a dose of 5 × 106 per mouse (n
  = 6 in each group). Tumor growth was measured continuously every 5 days, and 20
  days later, tumor growth was monitored every 3 days. After bearing the tumors for
  seven days, 300 mg of EVs was injected into the modeled mice via tail veins. Drug
  treatments were performed with push of doxorubicin (10 mg/kg) on days 12, 15, and
  18 after subcutaneously implantation. At 35 days postimplantation, the mice were
  euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation. (a) Tumor size. (b) Tumor weight. Tumor
  sections were obtained and stained with anti-BTBD7 and anti-Ki67 antibodies. (c)
  Representative views of BTBD7- and Ki67-positive tumor cells and quantification
  of immunohistochemical staining. (d) Expression of Notch1/Hes1 was detected using
  western blot. In (a), two-way ANOVA was used to determine statistical significance
  of quantification of immunohistochemical staining, whereas (b)–(d) one-way ANOVA
  was used. ∗p < 0.05. miR: microRNA; BTBD7: BTB domain containing 7; ANOVA: analysis
  of variance.'
