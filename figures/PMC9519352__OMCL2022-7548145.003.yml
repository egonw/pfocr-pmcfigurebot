caption: 'KAN0438757 (KAN) inhibited the NF-κB signaling pathway and subsequent p-P65
  nuclear translocation, as well as the MAPK signaling pathway. (a) The NF-κB signaling
  pathway protein expression levels after negative control, TNF-α, and TNF-α with
  2.5 μM KAN treatment for 10 and 30 min in NPPs. (b) The MAPK signaling pathway protein
  expression levels after negative control, TNF-α, and TNF-α with 2.5 μM KAN treatment
  for 10 and 30 min in NPPs. (c) The gray levels of p-IKKα/β, p-IκBα, and p-P65 were
  quantified and normalized to their respective total protein using ImageJ. (d) The
  gray levels of p-ERK, p-JNK, and p-P38 were quantified and normalized to their respective
  total protein using ImageJ. (e) Nuclear translocation of p-P65 after negative control,
  TNF-α, and TNF-α with 2.5 μM KAN treatment for 15 min, visualized by immunofluorescence.
  Scale bar = 20 μm and 5 μm. Data are expressed as mean ± SD, n = 3. ns: no significance;
  ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.'
