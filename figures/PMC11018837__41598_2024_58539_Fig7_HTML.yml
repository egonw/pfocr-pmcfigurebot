caption: RACGAP1 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation in A549 cells. A549 cells
  were transfected with si-Ctrl or three independent siRNAs for si-RACGAP1. (a) Cell
  cycle progression was determined through PI staining and FACS analysis. Representative
  plots and percentage of cells at different stages (G0/G1, G2/M, and S phases) were
  presented. *P < 0.05 vs. si-Ctrl. (b) Protein levels of CDK4 and CyclinD1 after
  RACGAP1 knockdown were determined using Western blot analysis. Representative images
  are shown and quantitated using ImageLab software. β-actin was used as an internal
  control. *P < 0.05 vs. si-Ctrl.
