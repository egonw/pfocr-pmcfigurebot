caption: '(a) Phenylpropanoid and (b) starch and sucrose biosynthetic pathways with
  DEGs. In this KEGG pathway analysis, 73 and 142 contigs were aligned; among them,
  9 and 5 showed differentiated expressions that are functionally identified, respectively.
  Colored enzyme codes mean mapped contigs to the pathways that were found in samples
  treated by ELICE16INDURES (low and high dosage). (c) Heat map highlights the up-
  and downregulated genes found in these pathways circled with red and green in KEGG-maps.
  Abbreviations of phenylpropanoid pathway: phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), phenylalanine/tyrosine
  ammonia-lyase (PTAL), trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase (CYP), 4-coumarate--CoA ligase
  (4CL), cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR), cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), beta-glucosidase
  (β-gluc.), sinapate 1-glucosyltransferase (glu.tr.) and peroxidase (perox.) Abbreviations
  of starch and sucrose metabolism: beta-fructofuranosidase (β -fruc.), alpha-glucosidase
  (α-glu.), sucrose alpha-glucosidase, hexokinase (he.k.), fructokinase (fru.k.),

  (glu.pm.), glycogen phosphorylase (gly.p.), ADP-sugar diphosphatase (sug.d.), glucose
  pyrophosphorylase (glu.p.), starch synthase (sta.s.), cellulose synthase (cel.s.),
