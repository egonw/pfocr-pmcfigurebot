figure_title: SGK1 transduces the [Cl−]i signal from decreased CFTR to downstream
  NF-κB/P2Y12 and PAR4 activation
caption: a MEG-01 cells were treated with active mutant S422D of SGK1 or inactive
  mutant S422A of SGK1for 48 h, respectively, and the expression of P2Y12 and PAR4
  was analyzed using Western blotting. (n = 5 independent experiments; one-way ANOVA).
  b Immunoblot analysis of effects of S422D or S422A on IκBα, p-IκBα, and NF-κB p65
  in MEG-01 cells (n = 5 independent experiments; one-way ANOVA). c Western blot images
  showing CFTR expression in MEG-01 cells transfected with S422D or S422A mutant (n = 7
  independent experiments; one-way ANOVA). d MEG-01 cells [Cl−]i transfected with
  S422D or S422A mutant was measured using the MQAE probe (n = 5 independent experiments;
  one-way ANOVA). e Immunoblot analysis indicating effects of transfection with ad-CFTR
  alone or co-transfection with ad-CFTR and S422D on expressions of P2Y12 and PAR4
  in MEG-01 cells (n = 5 independent experiments; one-way ANOVA). f Immunoblot analysis
  indicating effects of ad-CFTR or ad-CFTR and S422D on IκBα, p-IκBα, and p65 in MEG-01
  cells (n = 5 independent experiments; one-way ANOVA). Data are presented as mean ± SEM;
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001. ns not significant
