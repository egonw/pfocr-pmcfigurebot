caption: 'Metabolic pathway changes in PrBKT and CrBKT overexpression strains C18
  and P1 vs. WT. The orange font with the blue background represents the compound
  up-regulated and the white font with the blue background represents the compound
  down-regulated. Compounds with * indicate that the differential compound was detected
  only in P1. Data were derived from the biochemical experiments of this experiment
  and the log2 FC (differential fold change of metabolites in different groups) of
  the metabolome. The red font on the outermost circle represents that most of the
  gene expression levels of this pathway were up-regulated in C18 and P1; the data
  were derived from the transcriptome. IPP: isopentenyl diphosphate, GGPP: geranylgeranyl
  diphosphate, DXP: 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate, MEP: 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate,
  CDP-ME: 2- phospho- 4-(cytidine 5′-diphospho)-2-C- methyl-D- erythritol, CDP-MEP:

  dimethylallyl diphosphate, ALA: 5-aminolevulinic acid, PPIX: protoporphyrin IX,
  MgPPIX: magnesium protoporphyrin, FePPIX: iron protoporphyrin IX complex, BV: biliverdin,
