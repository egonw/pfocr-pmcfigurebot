caption: Luteolin attenuates the chemoresistance by downregulating P-gp through inhibiting
  the PTN/ALK/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway. (A) miR-384 mimics reduced the expression
  of PTN, ALK, p-GSK3β, β-catenin, and P-gp in MG63 cells, while miR-384 inhibitor
  enhanced their expression. miR-384 mimics impaired the chemoresistance to doxorubicin
  and cisplatin, while miR-384 inhibitor enhanced the chemoresistance in MG63 cells.
  (B) miR-384 mimics reduced the expression of β-catenin and impaired the chemoresistance
  to doxorubicin in MG63/DOX cells, while the effects of miR-384 inhibitor on β-catenin
  expression and chemoresistance were not significant. (C) miR-384 mimics reduced
  the expression of β-catenin and chemoresistance in U2OS cells, and miR-384 inhibitor
  enhanced the β-catenin expression and chemoresistance. (D-F) Effect of miR-384 inhibitor
  and PTN overexpression on β-catenin expression and chemoresistance after luteolin
  treatment.
