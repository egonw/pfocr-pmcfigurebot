caption: 'Results of network-based pathway enrichment analysis based on a breast cancer
  data set. -values ( scale) of t-tests for group difference of each gene pathway:
  a - compare REHE results against REML results; b - compare reREHE results against
  REML results. Two out-of-range data points are omitted from the plots, which correspond
  to: Glycosphingolipid biosynthesis - lacto and neolacto series pathway, with -value  by
  REML,  by REHE,  by reREHE; and Caffeine metabolism pathway with -value  by REML,  by
  REHE, and  by reREHE.'
