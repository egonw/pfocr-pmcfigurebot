caption: GCN2iB affects gene expression profiles in T2D mice. (A) A volcano plot was
  used to show the fold changes in differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the control
  group vs. the GCN2iB group. (B) Twelve significantly enriched KEGG pathways are
  listed as an advanced bubble chart. (C) The gene expression profiles of the DEGs
  that were involved in oxidative phosphorylation, the PPAR signaling pathway and
  glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways are shown in the heatmap. (D,E) The gene expression
  profiles of the DEGs that were involved in cardiac function, proteasome and biosynthesis
  of amino acids pathways are shown in the heatmap. (F) The mRNA levels of some randomly
  selected differentially expressed genes were measured by qPCR. In Figure (F), N
  = 5, values are expressed as the means Â± SD; * indicates p < 0.05; ** indicates
  p < 0.01; *** indicates p < 0.001.
