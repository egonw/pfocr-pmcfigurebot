caption: 'The cell adhesion molecule VCAM1 is a target gene of miR-95-3p in CESC.
  (A) Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes in the miR-95-3p-high group versus
  the miR-95-3p-low group. Red dots: upregulated genes (n=363); blue dots: downregulated
  genes (n=679). (B) GO terms of downregulated genes in the miR-95-3p-high group versus
  the miR-95-3p-low group. The cycle size represents the gene numbers in each term;
  the green gradient represents the âˆ’log10(adjusted P value) of each term. (C) GSEA
  of the CAM pathway in the miR-95-3p-high group versus the miR-95-3p-low group. (D)
  Expression heatmap of the 20 differentially expressed genes (the miR-95-3p-high
  group versus the miR-95-3p-low group) in the CAM pathway. (E) Venn diagram showing
  the intersection of the miR-95-3p target genes and CAM-related genes. (F) Scatter
  plot showing the negative correlation of miR-95-3p expression level and VCAM1 expression
  level in the CESC tumor samples. (G) The Kaplan-Meier plot of VCAM1 in CESC. VCAM1,
  vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; CESC, cervical squamous cell carcinoma; GO, Gene
  Ontology; GSEA, Gene Sets Enrichment Analysis; CAM, cell adhesion molecule.'
