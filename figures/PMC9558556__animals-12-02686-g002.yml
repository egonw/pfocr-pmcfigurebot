caption: 'Action site of analgesics commonly used during parturition. Depending on
  their action mechanism, these drugs intervene at different levels of the nociceptive
  pathway. The NSAIDs block harmful impulse transduction by inhibiting COX and PG
  production, while LA can intervene in the first three stages of the nociceptive
  pathway by blocking voltage-gated sodium channels in the spinal cord. Secondly,
  opioids are centrally acting analgesics that hyperpolarize neurons to prevent the
  projection and perception of pain. In general, all three types of drugs can potentially
  decrease the frequency and amplitude of contractions of the uterus, but this effect
  depends on the drug and dose administered. 1: transduction; 2: transmission; 3:
  modulation; 4: projection; 5; perception; COX: enzyme cyclooxygenase. GPCRs: G protein-coupled
  receptors; PGF2α: prostaglandin 2α.'
