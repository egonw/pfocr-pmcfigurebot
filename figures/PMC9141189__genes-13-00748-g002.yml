caption: The bud27Δ mutant seems to affect cell wall integrity. (A) Growth of the
  wild-type and bud27Δ mutant at 34 °C in SD minimal medium w/o or with calcofluor
  white (10 μg/mL). (B) The yeast cells grown in minimal medium were stained with
  calcofluor white (0.1 mg/mL) and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy.
