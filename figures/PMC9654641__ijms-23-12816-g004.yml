caption: 'Mechanisms underlying the shuterin-induced increase in granzyme B expression
  through the MAPK pathway. Cells were pretreated with various inhibitors (Z-AAD-CMK/granzyme
  b, LY-294002/AKT, U0126/ERK, SP-600125/JNK, and SB-203580/P38) for 1 h or left untreated;
  subsequently, these cells were treated with shuterin for 24 h. Protein levels were
  quantified through Western blotting and normalized to beta-actin levels using a
  densitometer. Granzyme B and granzyme b inhibitors (A,B); PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathway
  (C,D); p-AKT/AKT (E); p-ERK/ERK (F); p-JNK/JNK (G) and p-p38/p38 (H) * p < 0.05
  V.S. control, # p < 0.05 V.S. inhibitor-treated cells.'
