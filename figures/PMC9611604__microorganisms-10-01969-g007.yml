caption: Summary of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathways. AhR ligands such as
  6-formylindolo [3,2-b]carbazole; 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and polycyclic
  aromatic hydrocarbons cross the cytoplasmic membrane and bind to AhR. The ligand–AhR
  complex crosses into the nucleus and forms a heterodimer with the AhR nuclear translocator
  (ARNT). Binding of the ligand–AhR–ARNT complex with xenobiotic response elements
  (XREs) leads to the expression of cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily A, polypeptide
  1 (CYP1A1). CYP1A1 degrades AhR ligands. This leads to the induction of several
  genes encoding pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. The non-genomic
  pathway involves interaction between AhR and other transcription factors and modulates
  Ca2+ transport. This illustration was constructed using BioRender (https://biorender.com/,
  assessed on 6 September 2022).
