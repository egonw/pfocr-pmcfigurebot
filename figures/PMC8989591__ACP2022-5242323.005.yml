caption: 'Effects of ALK4 on the expression of molecules related to TGF-β signaling
  pathway. (a–c) mRNA (PCR) and protein (Western blotting) expressions of TGF-β in
  different groups. (d and e) Expression of Cyclin D1, c-Myc, and c-Jun was influenced
  by I/R injury and ALK4 (Western blotting). Data are presented as mean ± SD. ∗P <
  0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001, ALK4-NC+I/R group vs. ALK4-NC group. #P < 0.05,
  ##P < 0.01, and ###P < 0.001, ALK4-KO+I/R group vs. ALK4-NC+I/R group.'
