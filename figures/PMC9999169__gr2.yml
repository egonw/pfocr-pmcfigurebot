caption: 'Prediction and verification of the differential expression of miR-3470b
  target genes.A Heat map analysis of differentially expressed miRNAs in exosomes
  between the groups (NC vs. Ti). B Volcano diagram showing differentially expressed
  miRNAs in macrophage-derived exosomes from the wear particle-induced (Ti) loosening
  group and the control group (NC). C KEGG pathway analysis. D Statistical results
  of GO classification of network genes between groups. E RT-qPCR analysis showed
  that the expression of miR-3470b in macrophage exosomes (Exo-Ti) in the prosthesis
  loosening group was higher than that in the control group (Exo-Con). F miR-3470b
  binding target gene TAB3 was predicted by analyzing multiple databases. G Schematic
  of the binding sites between miRNAs and their target genes. H Demonstration of the
  results of the double-luciferase experiment. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, indicates a
  statistical difference. GO: Gene ontology; KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
  Genomes.'
