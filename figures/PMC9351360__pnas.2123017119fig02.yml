caption: MRSA infection of human whole blood down-regulates genes associated with
  immune signaling. RNA was isolated 4 h after infection for sequencing. (A) Principal
  component analysis was performed using the 797 genes that are differentially expressed
  in at least one condition. For each sample, principal component 1 (PC1) and principal
  component 2 (PC2) are plotted. Shapes denote donor (▪, donor 1; ●, donor 1R [second
  independent infection of donor 1]; ▴, donor 2; ♦, donor 3). Color denotes treatment
  (gray, buffer; aqua, heat-killed MOI ∼ 0.16; red, heat-killed MOI ∼ 16; purple,
  live MOI ∼ 0.16; yellow, live MOI ∼ 16). MOI designation was determined by the average
  number of white blood cells per milliliter of blood among donors. (B) Heat map of
  log2 fold change (log2FC) of genes that are significantly differentially expressed
  in at least one treatment. The histograms show the distribution of log2FCs within
  each treatment. Significantly differentially expressed genes are considered genes
  with a |log2FC| ≥ 1 and an adjusted P value ≤ 0.05. (C) Parallel pathway analysis
  (gene set enrichment analysis) was performed. Pathways that were enriched in at
  least one treatment are graphed in a bubble plot. The color of each bubble indicates
  the enrichment score. Positive enrichment score (red) indicates the pathway is up-regulated.
  Negative enrichment score (blue) indicates the pathway is down-regulated. The size
  of each bubble indicates how statistically strong the enrichment is. rRNA, ribosomal
  RNA.
