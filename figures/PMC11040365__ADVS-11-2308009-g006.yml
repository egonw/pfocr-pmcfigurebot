caption: Immune suppression mediated by RECQL4 in liver cancer radiotherapy is dependent
  on disrupted cGAS‐STING pathway. A) GSEA of gene expression data in FDUZS cohort
  shows inhibition of Cytosolic DNA Sensing Pathway, Interferon Alpha Response, and
  Interferon Gamma Response in RECQL4 high‐expressing group. B) Western blotting analysis
  of RECQL4, TBK1, p‐TBK1, IRF3, p‐IRF3, STING, and p‐STING. C,D) Growth curves of
  primary tumors (C) and secondary tumors (D) in STING‐mutation mice in different
  treatment groups. E,F) Flow cytometric analysis of tumor‐infiltrating CD3+ T cell
  population (Live/CD45+/CD3+ cells) and CD8+ T cell population (Live/CD45/CD3/CD8/CD69)
  in STING‐mutation mouse tumor tissue. G,H) Flow cytometric analysis of antigen‐specific
  dendritic cells (CD45+/CD11c+/SIINFEKL+ cells/CD80) in draining lymph nodes of STING‐mutation
  mice. I) Purified CD11c+ DCs from STING‐mutation mice were co‐cultured with initial
  CD8+ T cells, and IFN‐γ secretion was detected by ELISPOT assay. J,K) Growth curves
  of primary tumors (J) and secondary tumors (K) in cGAS‐KO mice in different treatment
  groups. L,M) Flow cytometric analysis of tumor‐infiltrating CD3+ T cell population
  and CD8+ T cell population in cGAS‐KO mouse tumor tissue. N,O) Flow cytometric analysis
  of antigen‐specific dendritic cells in cGAS‐KO mouse tumor tissue. P) ELISPOT assay
  detected IFN‐γ secretion in cGAS‐KO mice.
