figure_title: ST1072 treatment modulates T-cell expansion and migration after allo-BMT
caption: BALB/c mice were lethally irradiated and transplanted with 5×106/mouse TCD-BM
  (Ly5.1+) or plus purified T cells (1×106) from β-actin luciferase transgenic B6
  mice. The recipient mice were injected i.p. with vehicle alone or ST1072 at 1 mg/kg
  daily from day −1 to day 14. Donor T-cell expansion and migration were monitored
  using bioluminescent imaging (BLI) at the time points indicated. Macro-photos are
  shown for BLI of total body (A) and individual organs (B) with a region of interest
  (ROI) summary (C). Data shown here is pooled from two independent experiments (n=10
  per group). Significance is determined by Student’s t test. Asterisks indicate statistical
  significance *p < 0.05.
