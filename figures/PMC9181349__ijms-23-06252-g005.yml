caption: 'Se relieves the activation of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)/nuclear
  factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway induced by Cd. (A,B) HMGB1 immunofluorescence
  analysis. Blue: nucleus; Red: HMGB1; (C) The release of IL-18 and IL-1β in the culture
  medium; (D) The mRNA levels of HMGB1, myeloid differentiation primary response protein
  88 (MYD88), Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and NF-κB; (E) Protein band graph; (F) The
  protein levels of HMGB1, MYD88, TLR4, p65 and p-p65. The data are expressed as mean
  ± SD. “*” indicates a significant difference compared with control group (* p <
  0.05, ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001). “#” indicates a significant difference between
  Cd group (#p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001).'
