caption: 'FLOT1 overexpression resisted miR-1271-5p upregulation-induced viability
  and inhibition in migration and invasion of CC cells. (a, b) The viability of CC
  (SiHa and ME180) cells transfected with FLOT1 overexpression plasmids or miR-1271-5p
  mimic alone or in combination was measured by CCK-8 assay at 24-, 48-, and 72-h
  posttransfection. (c-h). The migration (c-e) and invasion (f-h) of CC (SiHa and
  ME180) cells after transfection with FLOT1 overexpression plasmids or miR-1271-5p
  mimic alone or in combination were evaluated by the Transwell assay (magnification:
  ×250; scale: 50 μm). +P or ^P or #P < 0.05; ++P or ^^P or ##P < 0.01; +++P or ^^^P
  or ###P < 0.001; + vs. FLOT1+MC; ^ vs. NC+MC; # vs. FLOT1+miR-1271-5p M. CC: cervical
  cancer; qRT-PCR: quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; CCK-8:
  cell counting kit-8; NC: negative control; M: miR-1271-5p mimic; MC: mimic control;
  FLOT1: flotillin 1.'
