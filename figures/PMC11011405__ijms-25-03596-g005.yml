caption: Gene ontology and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway analysis
  of differentially expressed genes and differentially expressed proteins. (A) GO
  terms among DEGs. Horizontal coordinates are Go level2 ranked term, vertical coordinates
  are −log10 (p-value) enriched for each term. (B) KEGG enrichment analysis of DEGs.
  The horizontal coordinate is the pathway name and the vertical coordinate is the
  −log10 (p-value) enriched for each pathway. (C) GO classification and enrichment
  of DEPs. The horizontal coordinate is the negative logarithmic transformation of
  the enrichment significance p-value and the vertical coordinate is the GO term.
  Each circle denotes a term, and the circle size indicates the differential protein
  count. The 3 main branches are indicated by different colors. (D) KEGG enrichment
  for DEPs. Horizontal coordinates indicate enrichment factors and vertical coordinates
  indicate negative logarithmic transformations of p-values. Circle size indicates
  counts, and different colors indicate different paths.
