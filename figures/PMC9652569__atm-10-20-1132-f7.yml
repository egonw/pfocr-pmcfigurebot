  pathway network. Pink circle nodes represent active compounds of HMM, purple hexagon
  nodes represent hub genes and yellow diamond nodes represent signaling pathways.
  (B) The critical network comprising four active ingredients, five hub genes, and
  two signaling pathways. The core component of (a.), constructed after analysis.
  HMM, Hedysarum multijugum Maxim.
