caption: Schematic representation of PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 signaling pathway. It’s sensitive
  to ER stress, so PERK is activated. PERK activation leads to phosphorylation of
  the eIF2α ring, which inhibits protein translation. Phosphorylated eIF2α enhances
  the translation of ATF4, a transcriptional activator of genes associated with metabolism
  and nutrition, cellular redox status, and apoptosis regulation. ATF4 mediates the
  production of transcriptional factor CHOP, and the upregulation of CHOP can aggravate
  the development of colitis.
