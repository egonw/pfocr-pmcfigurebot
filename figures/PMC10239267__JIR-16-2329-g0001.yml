caption: Effect of immune cells on chondrocyte apoptosis. Macrophages, T cells, B
  cells, NK cells and neutrophils can secrete IL-1β. IL-1β activates extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ERK) to reduce the production of cartilage ECM. TNF-α is
  secreted by monocytes and macrophages and results in the degradation of ECM by inducing
  collagenase and aggrecanase. In addition, IL-1β induces ECM degradation by inducing
  collagenase and aggrecanase, which leads to chondrocyte hypertrophy and dedifferentiation
  and eventually to chondrocyte apoptosis, resulting in osteoarthritis (OA). Another
  important signalling pathway by which IL-1β mediates the progression of OA is NF-κB.
  Activated IL-1β inhibits the expression of type II collagen and affects chondrocyte
  metabolism. In addition, MMPs degrade the ECM in a manner dependent on NF-κB, which
  leads to the degradation of chondrocytes. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) inhibits
  apoptosis in chondrocytes by regulating the MAPK and PI3K/Akt signalling pathways
  and inhibiting the NF-κB signalling pathway. Melittin inhibits the development of
  OA by inhibiting the decrease in type II collagen expression induced by NF-kB. In
  addition, alpha-mangostin (α-MG) inhibits the NF-kB pathway to limit the development
  of OA.
