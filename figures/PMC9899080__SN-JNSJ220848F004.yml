caption: 'CIE induces glutamatergic plasticity in the vlPAG/DRDA-dBNST pathway. A,
  Representative traces of oEPSCs recorded in the presence of picrotoxin at −70 mV
  (gray traces) to isolate AMPA-mediated EPSCs and at +40 mV to obtain NMDA-mediated
  amplitude (red traces) within the same dBNST neurons in response to 1- to 5-ms blue
  light stimulation. B, AMPA-mediated oEPSCs are increased in dBNST neurons of CIE
  mice. C, Compared with air mice, CIE-treated mice also have higher NMDA-mediated
  amplitudes. D, No change was observed in the AMPA/NMDA ratio. E, Representative
  traces of oEPSCs evoked at 50-ms interstimulus intervals in response to 1–5 ms of
  473-nm LED (blue bar). Responses normalized to the first peak: air (gray traces)
  and CIE (red traces). F, Withdrawal from CIE reduced the paired-pulse depression
  of oEPSCs observed in air mice without a change in the decay kinetics of the first
  peak (G). H, There was a trend but no significant correlation between the decay
  kinetics of the first peak and the magnitude of PPR. Data expressed as mean ± SEM;
  *p < 0.05.'
