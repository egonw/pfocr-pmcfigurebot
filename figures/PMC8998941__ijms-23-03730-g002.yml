caption: Schematic representation of the role of FER in the ABA signaling pathway.
  ABA directly represses ABI2 activity and releases activated SnRK2. Upon activation,
  SnRK2 induces expression of ABA-responsive genes and stomatal closure, inhibits
  H+-ATPase activity, and induces acidification of the cytosol, leading to inhibited
  cell growth. RALF and ABA increase the phosphorylation levels of FER, while FER
  activates ABI2 activity through the GEF1/4/10–ROP11/ARAC10 pathway, thereby inhibiting
  the ABA response []. FER also regulates ROS production through the GEF1/4/10-ROP11/ARAC10
  pathway to regulate ABA-mediated stomatal closure []. ABI2 interacts with and dephosphorylates
  FER to suppress the FER–GEF–ROP pathway [].
