caption: NO alters the expression of adipogenic proteins during adipocyte differentiation.
  3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated in the medium in the presence or absence of NONOate
  (0, 10, 20, and 30 μM), and adipocyte differentiation was induced in the continued
  presence or absence of NONOate. The expression of adipogenic proteins C/EBPα (A),
  PPARγ (B), and aP2 (C), was measured by immunoblotting with β-actin as the loading
  control. Those immunoblots are displayed as examples. Results are shown as mean
  ± SD for three independent experiments. * p < 0.05 compared with the vehicle control.
