figure_title: CTSB overexpression and silencing lentiviruses were successfully transfected
  into ApoE-/- mouse aortas and VSMCs
caption: '(A) CTSB overexpression and silencing lentiviruses transfected into ApoE-/-
  mouse aortas (scale bar: 100 μm). (B) CTSB overexpression and silencing lentiviruses
  transfected into VSMCs (scale bar: 100 μm). (C) Representative western blots of
  CTSB in aorta. (D) Representative western blots of CTSB in VSMCs. (E) Quantification
  analysis of CTSB protein level in aorta. (F) Quantification analysis of CTSB protein
  level in VSMCs.(G) Relative mRNA expression of CTSB in aorta. (H) Relative mRNA
  expression of CTSB in VSMCs. (I) The α-SMA expression between 5th and 15th passage
  of VSMCs. (J) Quantification analysis of α-SMA average integrated density level
  in VSMCs.Data are presented as means ± SEM. n = 3, *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001,
  and ****P<0.0001. NC: negative control; Mock: empty lentiviral vector; sh-CTSB:
  CTSB shRNA; Lv-CTSB: CTSB lentivirus; VSMCs: vascular smooth muscle cells; CTSB,
  cathepsin B.'
