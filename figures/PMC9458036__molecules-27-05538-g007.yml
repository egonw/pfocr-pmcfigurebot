caption: Mechanism of RES promoting osteogenic differentiation through ROS/HIF pathway.
  Schematic presentation of the role of RES on high-altitude hypoxia-induced osteoporosis
  via suppressing ROS/HIF-1α pathway. Under the condition of hypoxia, the release
  of ROS was enhanced, leading to reduced level of PHD2 and increased level of HIF-1α,
  which contributes to low expression of RUNX2 and deteriorative osteoblastogenesis.
  RES could effectively suppress the accumulation of ROS, thus rescuing the activity
  of PHD2, which leads to the downward level of HIF-1α and upward expression of RUNX2
  and osteoblastogenesis.
