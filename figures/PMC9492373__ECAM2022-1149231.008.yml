caption: 'Effects of ATL-III on apoptosis after inhibition of PERK. (a) Protective
  effect of ATL-III on apoptosis after using PERK inhibitor GSK2656157 was detected
  by flow cytometry. (b) Apoptosis rate by flow cytometry after treatment with the
  PERK inhibitor GSK2656157. c-f: protein expression levels of Bcl-2 (c, d), Bax (c,
  e), and Caspase-3 (c, f) after treatment with the PERK inhibitor GSK2656157. Data
  were mean ± SD; ∗∗P < 0.01 versus control group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 versus model
  group.'
