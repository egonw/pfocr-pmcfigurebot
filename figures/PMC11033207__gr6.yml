caption: Modulation of ROS through Nrf2 and NF-κB during aerobic exerciseROS are generated
  through oxidases such as NOX2, NOX4, XO, or ETC. In homeostasis, Nrf2 is anchored
  by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), a substrate adaptor for the cullin
  3-RING-box protein 1 ubiquitin ligase (Cul3) that induces Nrf2 to degradation by
  ubiquitination. The keap1 is a cysteine-rich protein, which can be oxidized by ROS,
  that changes its conformation and detaches Nrf2.,, The released Nrf2 heterodimerizes
  with musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma proteins (Maf proteins). They subsequently
  bind to the antioxidant response element (ARE) and finally activate the transcription
  of many antioxidants and detoxifying enzymes., NF-κB is activated primarily by two
  pathways. The canonical NF-κB pathway is triggered by stimulating pro-inflammatory
  receptors, such as the TNF receptor family, toll-like receptor family, and cytokine
  receptors for interleukins. Activating TNF receptors (TNFR) leads to the binding
  of TNFR1-associated death domain protein (TRADD), which will further recruit the
  Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2).
  TRAF2 forms a complex with receptor-interacting proteins (RIP1), leading to the
  activation of the NF-κB inhibitor (IκB) kinase (IKK) complex, which comprises two
  catalytic kinases, IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulatory subunit, IKKγ. p50 is initially
  inactive as a heterodimer with RelA by interacting with an inhibitory IκB protein.
  Phosphorylation of IκB on serines 32 and 36 by the activated IKK (primary IKKβ)
  targets it for ubiquitination. The ubiquitinated IκB is further degraded by proteosomes
  and disassociates the p50/RelA heterodimer, further translocating into the nucleus
  and binding to κB sites for specific gene transcription., In the noncanonical pathway,
  the TNF family cytokines, such as lymphotoxin-β (LTβ), activates the LTβ receptor
  (LTβR), which subsequently recruits TRAF2 and TRAF3, resulting in NF-κB-inducing
  kinase (NIK) activation. NIK subsequently activates IKKα, which leads to the phosphorylation
  of p100, resulting in its heterodimerization with RelB. The phosphorylated P100
  facilitates its ubiquitination and is processed into a P52-RelB heterodimer, translocating
  to the nucleus for gene transcription.
