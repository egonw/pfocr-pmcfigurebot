caption: (A) Alizarin red staining revealed that CHIR-99021 increased the osteogenesis
  ability in the normal group and decreased it in the AED group. Conversely, XAV-939
  decreased the osteogenesis ability in the normal group and decreased the ability
  in the AED group. (B) Statistic results of the area of the nodes. Data are means ± SEM.
  * means p < 0.05, ** means p < 0.01, *** means p < 0.001.
