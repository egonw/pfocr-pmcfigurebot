caption: 'Flow chart. In this study, we revealed 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid (18β-GRA)’s
  effect on gastric cancer (GC) cells phenotype and tumor formation in nude mice,
  and 18β-GRA’s effect on GC cells autophagy. We used TMT proteomic analysis and the
  STRING database to predict the differentially expressed autophagy-related proteins
  and their interactions. Later, we verified the link between miR-345-5p and TGM2
  using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain
  reaction was used to detect expression of miR-345-5p, western blot was used to detect
  autophagy-related proteins, and lentivirus transfection technique verified the effect
  of miR-345-5p on TGM2. LV-NC: Empty lentiviral vector.'
