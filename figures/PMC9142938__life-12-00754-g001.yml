caption: Schematic representation showing the putative brain pathway of SARS-CoV2
  in COVID-19. The virus enters the respiratory or olfactory epithelia of the nasal
  cavity, spreads (by trans-synaptic migration) to the brain through the olfactory
  or trigeminal tracts, and infects deeper parts of the brain, including respiratory
  centers in the thalamus, brain stem, and medulla. This leads to dysfunction of the
  respiratory centers, including Pre-BÃ¶tzinger complex, causing respiratory distress
  and hypoxaemia/hypoxia and leading to a strong stress response associated with sympathoexcitation.
  Dysfunction of the ANS triggers upregulation of VEGF and disruption of the BBB,
  further leading to the worsening of hypoxia, resulting in both acute and long-standing
  neurological symptoms.
