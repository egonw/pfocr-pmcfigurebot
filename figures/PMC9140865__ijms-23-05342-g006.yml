caption: 'U0126 treatment causes downregulation of DNA repair proteins and cell-cycle
  changes in pressure-loaded hepatocytes: (A) DNA repair proteins in hepatocytes treated
  with U0126 (10 μM) were examined with Western blot and quantification data of the
  γ-H2AX and 53BP1 protein levels. The cells were exposed to pressure for 48 h; (B)
  cell-cycle distribution was analyzed using flow cytometry following U0126 treatment
  and pressure loading for 48 h. The images are representative of three independent
  experiments. The stacked bar graph indicates the percentage of cells at various
  stages of the cell cycle. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD. n = 3, * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.'
