caption: 'YYFZBJS inhibits colorectal cancer progression in mice through suppression
  of the CDK1/PI3K/Akt pathway. (A, B) YYFZBJS suppresses intestinal shortening in
  the mouse model of colon cancer (n=10). (C, D) YYFZBJS inhibits tumorigenesis in
  the mouse model of colon cancer (n=10). (E) YYFZBJS slowed weight loss in the mouse
  model of colon cancer (n=10). (F) YYFZBJS improved intestinal DAI score in the mouse
  model of colon cancer (n=10). (G) Hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E; magnification:
  100×) analysis confirmed that YYFZBJS improved intestinal morphology after disruption
  by AOM and DSS and inhibited tumorigenesis. (H, I) Western blot analysis confirmed
  that the effects of YYFZBJS on the mouse model of colon cancer was mediated via
  CDK1/PI3K/Akt signaling. All data are presented as mean ± SD (n=3), ***p < 0.001,
  ****p < 0.0001 versus the control group; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001 versus
  the model group.'
