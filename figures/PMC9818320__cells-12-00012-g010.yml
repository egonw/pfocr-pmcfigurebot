caption: Effect of the DDC biosynthetic product (dopamine) and the DDC substrate (L-Dopa)
  on the SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) in cell culture. Vero E6 cells
  were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 (m.o.i. = 0.1) for 1 h and were subsequently treated,
  or not-treated (Control), with non-cytotoxic concentrations of L-Dopa or dopamine
  (DA). The virus-induced CPE was determined using an inverted microscope and representative
  images are shown in the lower panel. The observed CPE in the infected non-treated
  cells was set to 100%. Bars represent mean values from three independent experiments
  in triplicates. Error bars indicate standard deviations. p-values were determined
  by the Studentâ€™s t-test. * p < 0.0001 vs. Control.
