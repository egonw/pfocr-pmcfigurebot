caption: CircOMA1 positively regulates the expression of insulin‐like growth factor
  1 receptor (IGF‐IR) via sponging miR‐145‐5p. (A) The expressions of circOMA1 and
  IGF‐IR were determined by using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), respectively.
  (B) The results of qRT‐PCR showed that knock‐down or overexpression of circOMA1
  markedly reduced or increased the expression of IGF‐IR. (C) The expressions of IGF‐IR/mitogen‐activated
  protein kinase (MAPK)/epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in xenografts
  were determined using immunohistochemistry (IHC). (D) The Western blotting showed
  the changes in bladder cancer (BC) cells protein levels of IGF‐IR/MAPK/EMT markers.
  (E) Co‐localization of circOMA1 (red) and miR‐145‐5p (green). (F) RIP experiments
  were performed in T24 cells against IgG or AGO2, and the precipitated circOMA1 and
  miR‐145‐5p were detected by qRT‐PCR. (G) CircOMA1 has putative binding sites with
  miR‐145‐5p and mimic‐miR‐145‐5p significantly inhibited luciferase activity of circOMA1‐WT
  group. (H) The 3′UTR sequence of IGF‐IR is complementary to the seed sequence of
  miR‐145‐5p and mimic‐miR‐145‐5p significantly inhibited luciferase activity of IGF‐IR‐WT
  group. (I) Knock‐down of circOMA1 decreased the luciferase activity of BC cells
  transfected with IGF‐IR‐WT. The data are shown as the mean ± SD. *p < .05; **p < .01
