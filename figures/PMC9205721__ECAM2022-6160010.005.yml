caption: 'SS extract enhances LPS-induced activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. (a)
  Western blot analysis of the total and phosphorylated forms of Akt and HO-1 in cells
  treated for 20 h with the SS extract in the absence or presence of LPS stimulation
  (1 μg/mL). Densitometric analysis was performed using ImageJ software. (b) Real-time
  PCR analysis to determine changes in mRNA levels of Hmox1 following treatment with
  the SS extract (SS) in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. (c) A reporter gene assay
  showing regulation of Nrf2 transcriptional activity by the SS extract in RAW 264.7
  cells stimulated with LPS (1 μg/mL) in the presence or absence of the SS extract
  for 6 h (d) Determination of changes in cellular ROS levels after 20 hours of LPS
  (1 μg/mL) stimulation in the absence or presence of the SS extract. (e) Schematic
  diagram for the mechanism underlying the anti-inflammatory effect of the SS extract
  through inhibition of the NF-κB pathway activation and enhancement of the LPS-induced
  Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. The bars represent the mean ± standard deviation (SD); ∗: P <
  0.05, ∗∗: P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗: P < 0.001 compared with the indicated group. SS, Sargassum
  siliquastrum; LPS, lipopolysaccharide.'
