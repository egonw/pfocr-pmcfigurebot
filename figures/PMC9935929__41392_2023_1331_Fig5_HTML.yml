caption: Main signaling pathways and their inhibitors related to RA. The JAK signaling
  pathway, Notch signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway,
  PI3K signaling pathway, and SYK signaling pathway are the main signaling pathways
  involved in the process of RA. Related signalings are often the potential targets
  for drug discovery
