caption: Modulation of SOCS3 levels in prefrontal cortex of rats exposed to CMS and
  treated with agomelatine. mRNA (A) and protein (B) levels of SOCS3 were assessed
  in prefrontal cortex of rats exposed to CMS and treatment with agomelatine. Data,
  expressed as percentage vs. unstressed rats treated with vehicle (No Stress/Vehicle,
  set at 100%), are mean Â± SEM of at least 8 independent determinations. * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 vs. No Stress/Vehicle (two-way ANOVA with PLSD).
