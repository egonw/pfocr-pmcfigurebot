caption: The Gas6/Axl pathway mediates multiple steps of the metastatic cascade. Upon
  Axl binding to its ligand growth arrest specific 6 (Gas6) protein, Axl dimerizes
  and autophosphorylates its tyrosine residues in the kinase domain. Axl activation
  regulates downstream signaling, including the JAK/STAT pathway, Ras/MEK/Erk1/2 pathway,
  and PI3K/Akt pathway. In turn, the Gas6/Axl pathway upregulates pro-tumorigenic
  functions, such as immune evasion, survival, proliferation, drug resistance, angiogenesis,
  epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration, and invasion. Gas6 and Axl
  are also expressed by stromal cells, including endothelial cells, pericytes, and
  subsets of immune cells, to promote tumor progression and metastasis.
