caption: The carcinogenic effect of BRF2 may mainly depend on the inhibition of LKB1/AMPK
  signaling pathway. (a) The number of up-regulated genes and down-regulated genes
  in Huh7 cells by comparing the si-BRF2 group and the si-NC group. (b, c) Functional
  enrichment analysis including the GO and KEGG pathways was performed in the upregulated
  DEGs in Huh7-siBRF2. (d, e) Functional enrichment analysis including the GO and
  KEGG pathways was performed in the downregulated DEGs in Huh7-siBRF2. (f) The expression
  changes of AMPKα-2 mRNA levels after knockdown BRF2. (g) The expression changes
  of the LKB1-AMPK signaling pathway after knockdown of BRF2 by Western blotting.
