caption: SW480/oxaliplatin cell-derived exosomes accelerates angiogenesis. Exosomes
  were extracted from SW480/oxaliplatin and SW480 cells and then co-cultured with
  HUVECs. (a) The Transwell assay determined the HUVECs migration. (b) Photomicrographs
  of tube-like structures and quantification of the tube number. (c) The protein expression
  of CD31, VEGF, and phosphorylation Smad5 in HUVECs. All the above experiments were
  repeatedly performed 3 times; data are shown as the means ± SD. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P <
  0.01.
