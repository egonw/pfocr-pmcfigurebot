figure_title: Metabolomic profiling of breast cancer stem cells
caption: a TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 were subjected to different conditions,
  and metabolomics profiling of >300 metabolites was performed using a mass spectrometry-based
  assay. The resulting data were analysed in five different sets as shown and described
  in ‘Materials and methods’. Samples were subjected to metabolite extraction followed
  by purification and mass spectrometry analysis. The elevated pathways were identified
  using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. b Glutamine regulates GD2 expression in TNBC cells.
  TNBC cell lines SUM159 (3 × 105/well) and MDA-MB-231 (4.5 × 105/well) in 12-well
  plates were cultured with increasing concentrations of l-glutamine (0, 2, 4 and
  8 mM) for 72 h and GD2 expression was measured by flow cytometry. One-way ANOVA
  followed by Dunnett’s post hoc multiple comparison test was performed for GD2 expression,
  taking untreated cells as the control. **p = 0.006, *p < 0.05 and n.s. not significant.
  c Illustration of nutrient-replete and nutrient-deprived conditions regulating GD2
  expression. The left-side panel represents glucose-rich conditions (bold arrow)
  to maintain an optimal level of GD2 in a stress-free environment. The right-side
  panel depicts glucose depletion in metabolic stress conditions leading to an upregulation
  of GD2 expression by utilising the glutamine-mediated pathways (bold arrow). Grey
  colour represents low levels and blue represents higher levels of metabolites.
