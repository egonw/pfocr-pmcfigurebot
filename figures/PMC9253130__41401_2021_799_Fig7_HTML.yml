figure_title: ADT-OH regulates the protein level of FAK mainly through decreasing
  the mRNA stability of FAK
caption: a The FAK mRNA levels of B16F10, B16F1 and A375 cells were detected by qPCR
  analysis after ADT-OH treatment for 6 h, respectively. b Detection of FAK promoter
  transcriptional activity after ADT-OH treatment with dual luciferase in B16F10,
  B16F1 and A375 cells. c B16F10, B16F1 and A375 cells were treated with or without
  Act D (0.05 μg/mL) and ADT-OH (6.3 μM) for 12 h, and then the mRNA levels of FAK
  were detected. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.005, ****P < 0.001. Data are expressed
  as mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
