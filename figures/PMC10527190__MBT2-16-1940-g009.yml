caption: KEGG enrichment analysis based on significantly differential metabolites
  of Whitmania pigra edema disease. (A), Dot depicting the top 20 enriched pathways
  between control and edema Whitmania. pigra based on KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
  of differential metabolites. (B), Comparisons of the peak intensity for differential
  metabolites from six pathways that were significantly associated with enteritis
  and nephropathy. Pathways of mineral absorption, proximal tubule bicarbonate reclamation,
  arginine biosynthesis, valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, bile secretion,
  and phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis were indicated. D1, D2,
  D3, represents diseased leech, C1, C2, C3 represents the healthy leech.
