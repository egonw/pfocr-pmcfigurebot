figure_title: Oncogenic signaling pathways play a dual role in generating tumor hallmarks
  that increase demand for mevalonate pathway intermediates while concurrently upregulating
  mevalonate pathway meet the demand
caption: The mevalonate pathway supports signaling by cholesterol rich microdomains.
  Cilia act as a rheostat for WNT signaling. When cilia loss occurs, ß-catenin (ß-cat)
  interacts with SREBP2 to enforce expression of the mevalonate pathway to support
  tumorigenesis. Adhesion signaling from the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM)
  finely controls YAP/TAZ localization to promote survival in epithelial cells while
  reduced adhesion signaling, as encountered by mesenchymal cells, strongly promotes
  SREBP processing and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). PI3K-AKT signaling,
  a major mediator of Warburg metabolism, can activate mTORC1-mediated SREBP processing
  as well as ACLY-mediated conversion of citrate to acetyl-CoA for mevalonate synthesis.
  The MAPK pathway may also contribute to SREBP maturation as well as promote several
  tumor hallmarks. Statins affect tumor hallmarks by blocking synthesis of necessary
  intermediates, while farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTI) and geranylgeranyltransferase
  inhibitors (GGTI) block the use of specific intermediates (prenylation substrates)
  to meet the demand generated by tumor hallmarks, like macropinocytosis.
