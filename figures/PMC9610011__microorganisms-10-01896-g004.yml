caption: qRT-PCR and WST-1 assay of MC 38 cell lines. (a) qRT-PCR assay representing
  the G2M checkpoint pathway-related genes in MC 38 cell lines treated with Chek1
  siRNA and F. nucleatum. (b) WST-1 assay demonstrating the cell proliferation of
  MC 38 cell lines treated with Chek1 siRNA and F. nucleatum. (c) Scheme of the G2M
  checkpoint pathway and effect of F. nucleatum. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p <
  0.001, **** p < 0.0001. Statistical significance was calculated using Bonferroni
  tests.
