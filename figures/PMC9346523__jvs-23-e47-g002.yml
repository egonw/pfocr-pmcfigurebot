figure_title: Effects of AS-A2 on RANKL-induced osteoclast formation in BMMs. (A)
  BMMs (1.0 × 104 cells/well) were grown with AS-A2 concentrations (0, 0.05, 0.05,
  0.5, and 5 μM) for 24 h, and cell viability was determined by CCK-8 assay kit. (B)
  BMMs were cultured with RANKL (50 ng/mL) and M-CSF (30 ng/mL) in the presence of
  AS-A2. (C) Three or more nuclei in TRAP + MNCs were numbered, and the percentage
  is shown relative to RANKL. Data are presented as mean ± SD of three unrelated experiments
