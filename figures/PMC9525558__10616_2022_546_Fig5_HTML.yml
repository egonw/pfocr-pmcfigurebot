caption: 'Salinomycin suppressed tumor growth in vivo by inhibiting KDM1A. T24 cells
  transfected with the KDM1A overexpression plasmid or empty vector were injected
  into nude mice. The mice were then treated with salinomycin by intraperitoneal injection.
  A and B The volumes and weights of xenograft tumors were measured and plotted, C
  The expression of cell proliferation-related markers Ki67 and PCNA and apoptosis-related
  proteins was assessed by western blotting, D KDM1A expression was evaluated by western
  blotting, E The expression of UPR pathway-related proteins was evaluated by western
  blotting, F and G KDM1A expression was evaluated by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry.
  **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, vs. Control; ###, P < 0.001, vs. salinomycin'
