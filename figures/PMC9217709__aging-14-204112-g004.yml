caption: Differentially expressed gene identification and analysis. (A) The distribution
  of differentially expressed mRNAs between the high and low infiltration groups.
  Totals of 1791 DEmRNAs (845 upregulated and 946 downregulated) were identified according
  to the |LogFC|>1 and p<0.05. (B) The distribution of differentially expressed mRNAs
  between the LUAD and normal tissues. Totals of 5587 DEmRNAs (3724 upregulated and
  1863 downregulated) were identified according to the |LogFC|>1 and p<0.05. (C) Key
  DEmRNAs identification and KEGG enrichment analysis. 1169 DEmRNAs were common in
  two types of DEmRNA sets from the comparison between the high and low infiltration
  groups and between the LUAD and normal lung tissues. These gene mainly involved
  in some immune KEGG pathways including cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and
  IL-17 signaling pathway. (D) PPI network construction of key genes encoding proteins.
  A PPI network with 465 nodes and 2152 edges was established. (E) Identification
  of highly corelated module with the highest score. One module with 123 nodes and
  1573 edges was identified. (F) The expression analysis of five genes between the
  LUAD and normal lung tissues. The expressions of four genes including FPR2, GNGT2,
  ADCY8 and PPBP were significantly different between the LUAD and normal tissues.
  (G) The expression correlations among four essential genes. There were lower correlations
  in expression among four genes. (H) The expression analysis of four genes based
  on real transcriptome data. The expressions of four genes had significant differences
  between the LUAD and normal tissues. LUAD, lung adenocarcinoma; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes; DEG, differentially expressed gene; PPI, protein and protein
  interaction; FPKM, fragments per kilobase of exon model per million mapped fragments.
