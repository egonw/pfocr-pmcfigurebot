caption: 'Metabolic pathway enrichment and regression analyses(A) Pathway enrichment
  analysis of the differentiated metabolites that distinguished the study groups;
  the bubble size refers to the enrichment factor of the pathway and the color represents
  the natural log of the pathway p value.(B) Correlation plot depicting the relation
  of each metabolite and LDLR status; positive or negative β-coefficient values indicate
  a positive or negative correlation between metabolites and LDLR status (at least
  LDLR null mutation: null/null or null/defective), FDR-adjusted p < 0.05 was considered
  as significant threshold, n.s. represents no significance; Model 1: Adjustments
  for ages, gender, and CVD history; Model 2: Adjustments for all variables in model
  1 and clinical lipids (TC, TG, LDL-C, HDL-C, Lp(a), and APOB). NN = null/null, DD =
  defective/defective, ND = null/defective. Other abbreviations are seen in .'
