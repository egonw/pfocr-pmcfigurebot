caption: Permeation and metabolization of atenolol and propranolol in the Chip4. (A)
  Concentration of glucose, lactate, LDH and albumin in the circulation (Circ) and
  the brain compartment after 5 days of Chip4 culture. Twelve chips with BMEC-like
  cells (n = 12) and three chips without BMEC-like cells (n = 3) in the presence of
  neural and liver spheroids from one experiment were analyzed. On the y-axis, substance
  concentrations of individual circuits and mean values + s.e.m. are shown. Concentration
  differences were compared by two-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc test (**** p < 0.0001,
  *** p < 0.001, ** p < 0,01, * p < 0.05). (B) Measured concentrations and ratios
  between the brain compartment and the medium circulation of propranolol and atenolol
  in the Chip4, 48 h after substance application. Mean values of two experiments (N
  = 2) with four and five chip replicates each and standard deviation (SD) are shown.
  (C) Measured concentration ratio between brain compartment and medium circulation
  of propranolol and atenolol, with and without BMEC-like cells from two experiments
  (N = 2) are shown with three and five chip replicates per condition (n = 3–5). On
  the y-axis, mean concentration ratios + s.e.m. are shown. Differences between circulation
  and brain compartment were compared by an unpaired t-test (* p < 0.05, **** p <
  0.0001). (D) Proposed metabolic pathway for propranolol and atenolol in the Chip4.
  An identical instrument response is assumed for parent and metabolites. Identification
  of atenolol metabolites is based on accurate mass only. (E) Distribution of propranolol
  and atenolol metabolites between medium circulation (Circ) and the brain compartment
  48 h after substance application. Three cell-free Chip4 (n = 3), five Chip4 with
  BMEC-like cells, neural and liver spheroids (n = 5) and three Chip4 without BMEC-like
  cells and with neural and liver spheroids (n = 3) were analyzed. On the y-axis,
  the area under curve (AUC) values of individual circuits and mean values + s.e.m.
  are shown. The dotted line shows concentration in the application medium. Differences
  between circulation and brain compartment were compared by unpaired t-tests (****
  p < 0.0001, *** p < 0.001).
