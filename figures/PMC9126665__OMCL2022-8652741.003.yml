caption: 'NBP inhibited oxidative stress injury and triggered nuclear translocation
  of Nrf2 and upregulated its downregulated genes. Effects of NBP on (a) SOD activity,
  (b) MDA content (n = 8 in each group); and (c) 8-iso PGF2α level (n = 10 in each
  group) after RCIR injury. (d)–(g) Representative immunoblots and densitometry analysis
  of nuclear-Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 in the hippocampus in four groups. (h)–(n) The mRNA
  levels of the Nrf2 and Nrf2 target genes in the hippocampus were evaluated. n =
  6 in each group. (o) Localization of Nrf2 was performed by immunofluorescence staining
  in hippocampus 4 weeks after NBP treatment. Immunofluorescence labeling of Nrf2
  (green) and nuclei was stained with DAPI (blue). The merged images showed the nuclear
  location of Nrf2 protein (400×, bar = 20 μm). n = 3 in each group. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P
  < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, the RCIR group vs. the sham group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01,
  ###P < 0.001, the NBP80 group or the NBP120 group vs. the RCIR group; $P < 0.05,
  $$P < 0.01, the NBP80 group vs. NBP120 group. Values are expressed as the mean ±
  SD.'
