caption: (A-B) Click-IT HPG analysis of protein synthesis rates in Lin− BM cells (*P
  < 0.05; n = 3 independent biological replicates). (C) Polysome analysis of LSPC
  (+TAM vs. −TAM) for 48 hrs. (D) Click-IT HPG analysis of protein synthesis rates
  in Lin− BM cells transduced with shRNAs targeting snoRNAs (*P < 0.05; n = 3 independent
  biological replicates). (E) Relative viability of LSPC (+TAM vs. −TAM) treated with
  puromycin determined by CellTiter-Glo (*P < 0.05; n = 3 independent biological replicates).
  (F) CRISPR knockout screen for gRNA that promote the survival of DDX41-deficient
  Lin− BM cells. (G) Guide RNAs that were enriched in Ddx41−/− Lin− BM cells relative
  to control-transduced cells. Color-coding of highlighted genes corresponds to H.
  (H) Pathway enrichment for gRNAs that are enriched in Ddx41−/− Lin− cultures compared
  to Ddx41+/+. (I) Tamoxifen injection schedule after BM transplant. (J) Percent of
  CD45.2+ LK cells and LT-HSC (LSK, CD150+, CD48−) 4-weeks post-tamoxifen (*P < 0.05;
  n = 3 mice per group). (K) Relative amount of unexcised Ddx41 allele remaining in
  LK and LT-HSC in the BM 4-weeks post-tamoxifen. The dotted line is equivalent to
  one unexcised allele.
