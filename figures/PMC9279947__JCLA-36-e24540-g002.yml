caption: miR‐1290 can serve as a potential target of circ_0008726. (A) The database
  predicted that there was a potential binding miRNA with circ_0008726. (B) The predictive
  analysis of the binding site of miR‐1290 and circ_0008726; (C) luciferase reporter
  gene detection for HEK239T luciferase activity in cells; (D) luciferase reporter
  gene assay was carried out to detect luciferase activity in HTR‐8/SVneo cells; (E)
  qRT‐PCR was used to detect the expression level of circ_0008726 in HTR‐8/SVneo cells.

article_title: Hsa_circ_0008726 regulates the proliferation, migration, and invasion
  of trophoblast cells in preeclampsia through modulating the miR‐1290‐LHX6 signaling
  pathway.
