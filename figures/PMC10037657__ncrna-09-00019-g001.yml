caption: The potential mechanisms of the LncRNA H19/miR-675 axis in HCC. (A) H19/miR-675
  inhibits the expression of PPARÎ±, which further activates the Akt/mTOR signaling
  pathway, thus modulating energy metabolism and cell apoptosis, eventually promoting
  the development of HCC. (B) H19/miR-675 decreased the expression of p53, thus degrading
  cell apoptosis, eventually promoting the development of HCC. (C) H19 /miR-675 inhibited
  the expression of Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), thus reducing
  necrosis, eventually suppressing the development of HCC.
