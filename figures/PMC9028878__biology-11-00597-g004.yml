caption: SOS signaling pathway functions in ion homeostasis and Na+ extrusion from
  cytosol; A rise in cytosolic calcium is induced by high extracellular salt concentrations.
  The calcium sensor SOS3 interacts with and activates the protein kinase SOS2 when
  it detects a signal. The ion transporter activities of transcription factors (TFs)
  are then regulated by activated SOS2 to regulate ion homeostasis or gene expression.
  The SOS1 Na+/H+ antiporter, the NHX vacuolar Na+/H+ exchangers, and the Na+/H+ transporter
  HKT1 are all SOS2 targets. Tonoplast ATPase and pyrophosphates, water channels,
  and the K+ transporter are among the other targets.
