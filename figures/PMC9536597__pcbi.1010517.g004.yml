figure_title: Resulting p-values for cross-scoring 23 drug classes GWAS against very
  severe COVID-19 GWAS for anti-coherence (A) and coherence (B)
caption: Each data point corresponds to a gene. The dotted red line marks a Bonferroni
  significance threshold of 1.18×10−7 (0.05 divided by the 18453 genes tested and
  23 drug classes). Note that the drug class M05B shows the most significant enrichment
  in coherence with severe COVID-19.
