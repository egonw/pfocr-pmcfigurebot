caption: 'Schizandrin C inhibits the p38/ERK MAPK signaling pathway. (A) The images
  of MAPK signaling-associated proteins detected by Western blotting. (B) Densitometric
  analysis for MAPK signaling-associated proteins, n = 5. Representative results of
  immunofluorescence staining for p-ERK (C) and p-p38 (D). Data are expressed as mean
  ± S.D. *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 versus the control group; #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01
  versus the model group.'
