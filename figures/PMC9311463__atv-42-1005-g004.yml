caption: Transcriptomic differences between the mSMC1 and mSMC2 clusters identify
  changes in global transcript levels and increased Perk signaling in mSMC2 cells.
  A, The top 20 genes upregulated in the mSMC1 and mSMC2 clusters show substantial
  overlap. B, Heatmap compares expression of Perk targets, contractile genes, fibromyocyte
  markers, macrophage and complement pathway markers, and osteogenic markers between
  mSMC1 and mSMC2. C, Compared with cSMCs and mSMC1 cells, mSMC2 cells show significantly
  increased expression of Perk targets (only cells that had detectable expression
  of the concerned genes were included in the analysis). D, mSMC2 cells have significantly
  decreased mRNA transcripts when compared with cSMCs in both genotypes with and without
  hyperlipidemia and HFD as well as mSMC1 cells in both genotypes. E, Serpine1 shows
  higher expression in mSMC2 than mSMC1. F, Pai1+ mSMC2 cells were abundant in the
  media and the lesions in both the aortic root and the ascending aortas of control
  mice and quite rare in those of PerkSMC−/− mice. G, Expression of Serpine1 is dependent
  on Perk. H, Vcam1 expression is significantly higher in mSMC1 compared with mSMC2.
  I, Vcam1 immunostaining in the aortic root in the PerkSMC+/+ and PerkSMC−/− aortas
  identified staining in the plaques, but more intense staining was present in cells
  in the fibrous cap of the PerkSMC+/+ aortas. In the ascending aortas, Vcam1+ staining
  cells were in the plaque in the PerkSMC+/+ mice, but stronger Vcam1 staining was
  observed in the cells the medial layer of PerkSMC−/− mice. J, Cholesterol-induced
  upregulation of Vcam1 is independent of Perk. All qPCR data were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis
  test followed by Dunn multiple comparisons test. Data are represented as mean±SD.
  AF indicates autofluorescence; L, lumen; M, medial layer; and P, plaque.
