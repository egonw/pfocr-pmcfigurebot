caption: Significance of 3D matrix stress relaxation on diverse cell behaviors. (A)
  MSC lineage specification; MSCs cultured in fast-relaxing alginate-based 3D gels
  show enhanced osteogenesis (alkaline phosphatase stain) and reduced adipogenesis
  (Oil red O stain). Adapted with permission from Chaudhuri et al. [] in Nat. Mater.,
  2016. (B) Chondrocyte matrix formation; chondrocytes in fast-relaxing gels exhibit
  greater proliferation rate, anabolic metabolism, and cartilage-forming behavior,
  whereas those in slow-relaxing gels express catabolic, cartilage-degrading pathway
  and end in cell death. Adapted with permission from Lee et al. [] in Nat. Mater.,
  2017. (C) Cancer cell mitosis; cancer cells in the fast-relaxing deform the surrounding
  matrix effectively to allow mitotic elongation and cell division, whereas those
  in slow-relaxing gels fail to complete mitosis. Adapted with permission from Nam
  et al. [] in Nat. Phys., 2018. (D) Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) morphogenesis.
  Human iPSCs in fast-relaxing gels show promoted viability, proliferation, and apicobasal
  polarization, and ultimately lumen formation. Those in slow-relaxing gels end up
  in apoptosis. Other than stress relaxation, increasing RGD ligand density enhances
  iPSC morphogenesis. Adapted with permission from Indana et al. [] in Adv. Mater.,
  2021.
