caption: 'Schematic diagram of M. mercenaria cAMP-PKA pathway involved in osmoregulation.
  The four boxes in a row below each metabolite or gene represent different groups:
  S30, S10_8h, S10_1d, and S10_5d. Colors of each box indicate the relative content
  or expression level of each metabolite or gene. Red indicates a high level, and
  blue indicates low. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure
  legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)'
article_title: Metabolomics and biochemical assays reveal the metabolic responses
  to hypo-salinity stress and osmoregulatory role of cAMP-PKA pathway in Mercenaria
  mercenaria.
