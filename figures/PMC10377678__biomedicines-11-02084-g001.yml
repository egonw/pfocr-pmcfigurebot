caption: The androgen receptor signaling pathway. The 5-a reductase enzyme converts
  testosterone into the highly active dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Unbounded AR is located
  in the cytoplasm, chaperoned by a complex of proteins such as HSP90. Upon the binding
  of DHT, AR separates from chaperone proteins, dimerizes, and relocates to the nucleus,
  binding to androgen response elements (AREs) found in AR target genes.
