caption: Mechanotransduction regulating regenerative responses. The signaling transduction
  of exercise-induced regeneration are generally initiated by mechanical signals.
  A series of membrane receptors or channels can respond to mechanical signals, thereby
  converting mechanical signals into chemical molecular signals. Piezo1 channels,
  working as non-selective cationic channels, sense the exercise-induced stress, converting
  into mechanical stress-evoked Ca2+signaling. Integrin-based adhesion complex activates
  FAK, promoting YAP/TAZ translocation via inhibiting Hippo signaling. FAK can drive
  HDAC5 nuclear translocation and suppress SOST. Integrins or Piezo channels activate
  the transcription of ligands of Notch receptor in sending cell, triggering Notch
  signaling of receiving cell. Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway is important in osteogenesis,
  which can be inhibited by SOST. Connexin 43 responds to the mechanotransduction
  for cell-to-cell communication. Created with BioRender
