caption: The relationship between miRNAs and target genes. (a) Network diagram showing
  the relationship between miRNAs and target genes. Pink indicates miRNA, and blue
  indicates miRNA target genes. The size of the shape indicates the degree of connectivity
  (the larger is the shape, the higher is the degree of connectivity). (b) Network
  diagram showing the relationship between miRNAs and pathways with enriched target
  genes. Blue represents miRNA, and orange represents the KEGG pathway. The size of
  the shape indicates the degree of connectivity; the larger is the shape, the higher
  is the degree of connectivity. The thickness of the line indicates the degree of
  enrichment; the thicker is the line, the more enrichment of the miRNA target gene
  in the pathway.
