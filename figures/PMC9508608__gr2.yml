caption: 'The possible mechanism of methionine on mTORC1 activity and autophagy. A:
  Methionine can lead to higher circulating SAM concentrations. This is sensed by
  SAMTOR leading to an activation of mTORC1. Also intracellular SAM can methylate
  phosphatase 2A which activates mTORC1. Activated mTORC1 supresses the activity of
  the ULK1 complex through a specific phosphorylation on SER757 resulting in autophagy
  inhibition. This can lead to higher levels of damaged cell organelles such as mitochondria
  producing more ROS. B: Under methionine restricition SAM levels are altered leading
  to a supressed mTORC1 activity. The ULK1 complex is active and promotes autophagy.
  Also the suppressed mTORC1 can lead to higher H2S production, a radical scavenger
  leading to lower ROS levels. Besides, the possible upregulation of the salvage pathway
  in the methionine cycle by methionine restriction leads to higher levels of polyamines,
  able to stimulate cytoprotective autophagy. mTORC1 = mammalian target of rapamycin
  complex 1, SAM = S-adenosylmethionine, ROS = radical oxygen species.'
