caption: Proposed model of MSC-induced GIST resistance. MSC present in the tumor microenvironment
  induce resistance to Imatinib in GIST. This resistance is mediated through activation
  of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in tumor cells by TGF-β2 secreted by the mesenchymal
  stem cells. The quantity of MSC within the tumor tissue is correlated with both
  drug resistance and prognosis. Created with BioRender.com
article_title: Mesenchymal stromal cells promote the drug resistance of gastrointestinal
  stromal tumors by activating the PI3K-AKT pathway via TGF-β2.
