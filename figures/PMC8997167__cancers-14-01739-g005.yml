caption: Targeting mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation inhibits LuCaP PDX tumor
  viability. (a) A schematic showing the workflow of LuCaP PDX tissue slice culture.
  LuCaP tumor core is punched using a 6 mm biopsy punch and sliced into 250 µm sections
  using an automated vibratome. The sliced tissues are placed on an insert for culture
  before tissue viability using RealTime Glo and small-molecule inhibitor treatment.
  The treated tissue slices are then imaged using IVIS spectrum to measure their response
  to treatment by acquiring the intensity of bioluminescence. (b) A bar graph showing
  the viability of LuCaP 147 CR tissues treated with staurosporine (0.5 µM), docetaxel
  (5 µM), and enzalutamide (5 µM). Bars represent the mean of two independent slices.
  Error bars represent SEM. (c) Bar graphs showing the response of LuCaP 86.2 CR and
  147 CR to antimycin (0.5 µM) and torin2 (0.5 µM) relative to control. Images of
  live tissues taken using IVIS Spectrum on day 0 and 6 are shown on the right. (d)
  A bar graph illustrating the signal intensity of proteins associated with apoptosis
  (green panel) and glycolysis (orange panel) in LuCaP 86.2 CR after treatment with
  antimycin (0.5 µM). n = at least two biological replicates (e) A GSEA plot showing
  enrichment of oxidative phosphorylation gene sets in enzalutamide-resistant prostate
  cancers.
