caption: Lycorine induced prostate cancer cell apoptosis. (A) DU145 cells and PC3
  cells were treated with Lycorine at final concentrations as indicated. Cell viability
  was determined using MTT Assay After treated with lycorine for 24 hours. (B) Cells
  were harvest for apoptotic analysis using Annexin V-FITC staining. (C) Cells were
  harvest after treat with lycorine for 24 hours, and then analyzed by western blot,
  GAPDH was used as control. (D) Lycorine inhibited DU145 and PC3 cells migration.
  (A) PC3 and DU145 cells were plated in the upper chamber without FBS, and tested
  with or without lycorine. And 1640 with FBS were plated in the lower chamber. On
  the time, after removing the supernatant, cells were stained with crystal. And then
  record the data with a microscope.
