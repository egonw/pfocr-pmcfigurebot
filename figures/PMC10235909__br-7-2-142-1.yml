caption: Antioxidant effect of Zn on HUC-MSCs through Nrf2/Sirt3 signaling pathway.
  A The effect of Zn on the level of ROS production. DCFH-DA staining was used to
  measure intracellular ROS production. The scale bar indicates 100 μm. B Over time,
  under zinc treatment, the expression of Nrf2, Sirt3, and PGC-1α protein was measured
  by an illustrative Western blot. Four independent experiments were carried out and
  typical results were given. C, D Normalized the quantification of Nrf2 (C) and PGC-1α
  (D) to GAPDH and measured by image J. The results are expressed as mean ± S.D.,
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. E Real-time quantitative PCR results of Nrf2,
  Sirt3 and PGC-1α gene expression under Zn treatment (n = 5). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01
