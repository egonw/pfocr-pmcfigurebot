caption: CISH depletion favors IL-15 cytokine signaling pathway. (A, B) FACS analysis
  of Cish +/+Ncr1Ki/+ and Cish fl/flNcr1Ki/+ purified NK cells labeled with CFSE and
  cultured for 6 d in IL-15 (10–50 ng/mL). (A) Representative FACS plot is showed.
  (B) Representative curve using cells from 3 mice and two independent experiments
  are shown. (C) FACS was used to quantify the MFI of CD122 at different time points
  on Cish +/+Ncr1Ki/+ and Cish fl/flNcr1Ki/+ NK cells. (C) Representative curve of
  3 different experiments are shown. (D, E) Histograms using cells from 6 mice and
  two independent experiments showing Flow cytometric analysis of IFN-γ production
  (D) and CD107a (LAMP-1) (E) expression Cish +/+Ncr1Ki/+ and Cish fl/flNcr1Ki/+ NK
  cells from splenocytes cultured for 4 hours in IL-15 (50 ng/mL). *P<0.05, **p<0.01
  (Student’s t-test). CFSE, carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester; CISH, cytokine
  inducible SH2-containing protein; NK, natural killer.
article_title: Targeting CISH enhances natural cytotoxicity receptor signaling and
  reduces NK cell exhaustion to improve solid tumor immunity.
