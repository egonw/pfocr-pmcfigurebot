caption: 'Comprehensive Discovery of Target Genes Modulating HTR-8/SVneo Function
  and the Mediators Governing hVSMCs Reprogramming. a KEGG enrichment pathway analysis
  of the intersection gene of down regulated genes in HTR-8/SVneoshDAB2 group of RNAseq
  and EVT genes in sc-RNA seq. b The enrichment circle figure showed that these co-down-regulated
  genes were enriched in insulin-like growth factor receptor signaling pathway and
  other pathways, which related with the cell survival and motility. c Intersection
  of downregulated genes from HTR-8/SVneo RNA-seq and EVT from scRNA-seq. Ten distinctly
  different chemokines and inflammatory factors potentially involved in the regulation
  of the maternal–fetal interface were selected for further enrichment analysis. d
  The mRNA level of chemokine and inflammatory factors were decreased in HTR-8/SVneoshDAB2
  group then verified by qRT-PCR. ( HTR-8shNCvs HTR-8shDAB2: IL20R: 1.525 ± 0.193

  of co-downregulated genes in hV+H8shDAB2 group of hVSMCs RNA seq and PV of sc-RNA
  seq. f GSEA KEGG enrichment analysis of co-down-regulated genes in hV+H8shDAB2 group
  of hVSMCs RNA seq and PV of sc-RNA seq. The enrichment analysis of GSEA KEGG signaling
  pathway showed that IL8 CXCR1/2 signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway were
  down-regulated by analyzing the differential gene expression levels of co-down-regulated
  genes in hV+H8shDAB2 group of hVSMC RNA seq and PV of sc-RNA seq. g After hVSMC
  was co-cultured with medium supernatants from different groups, WB was used to detect
  important molecules (AKT, p-AKT, p38, p-p38, p-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, p-JNK, JNK) in both
  pathways. The results showed that only PI3K/AKT pathway and p-p38 MAPK pathway were
  significantly different (hV+H8shNCvs hV+H8shDAB2: p-AKT/AKT: 1.02 ± 0.09 vs 0.73 ± 0.03,
  p** < 0.01; p-p38/p38: 1.211 ± 0.05 vs 1.062 ± 0.04, p* < 0.05; p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2:
  0.083 ± 0.11 vs 0.715 ± 0.27, p = 0.53; p-JNK/JNK: 0.893 ± 0.14 vs 0.80 ± 0.17,
