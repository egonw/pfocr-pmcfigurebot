caption: TRPM4 inhibited tumor metastasis in vivo. (A) Representative bloody ascites
  images of metastasis mice and statistical analysis of metastasis in the two groups
  of nude mice intraperitoneally injected with HT29/Mock and HT29/TRPM4 cells. (B)
  Images of liver metastases of nude mice injected HT29/Mock and HT29/TRPM4 cells
  in spleen. (C) Liver cross sections stained with H&E of nude mice injected HT29/Mock
  and HT29/TRPM4 cells in spleen. More liver tissue was inundated with metastase in
  vector-transfected group. (D) Scatter diagram showed the number of metastatic nodules
  was more in nude mice injected with HT29/Mock cells in spleen. (E) Percentage of
  tumor area to total liver area was higher in nude mice injected with HT29/Mock cells
  in spleen compared with HT29/TRPM4 group. The results were represented as mean Â±
  SD, * p<0.05,**P < 0.01.
