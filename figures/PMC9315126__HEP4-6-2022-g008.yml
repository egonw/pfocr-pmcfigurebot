caption: Volcano plots of dysregulated phosphosites associated with DR signaling.
  Volcano plots of changes in phosphosites of proteins in the DR signaling pathway
  after chronic ethanol feeding in (A) C57BL/6 and (B) Rip3 −/− mice and (C) between
  chronic ethanol‐fed Rip3 −/− and C57BL/6 mice. P values (–log base 10) are plotted
  as a function of phosphosite ratio (log base 2) for (A,B) ethanol‐fed compared to
  pair‐fed mice or (C) between genotypes. DR, death receptor; EtOH, ethanol; Rip3,
  receptor‐interacting protein kinase 1
article_title: Phosphoproteomics identifies pathways underlying the role of receptor‐interaction
  protein kinase 3 in alcohol‐associated liver disease and uncovers apoptosis signal‐regulating
  kinase 1 as a target.
