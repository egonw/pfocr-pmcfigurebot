caption: 'Cell cycle assay and mitochondrial activity results. (A) Cytometry plots
  with DAPI fluorescence and events count. Colours correspond with each population
  defined by fox synchronous algorithm. (B) Box-plot for each population previously
  defined in the cytometry plot that represents the percentage of cell cycle populations
  from parent population. (C) Linear regression between relative fluorescence units
  (RFU) and cell concentration in both genotypes (ALMS1 +/+ and ALMS1 −/−). This experiment
  was carried out in triplicate and repeated 3 times on different days (N = 3, n =
  3). *: p-value < 0.05, **: p-value < 0.01.'
