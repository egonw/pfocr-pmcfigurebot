caption: Lovastatin targets the ribosome biogenesis pathway and induces nucleolar
  stress in TNBC cancer stem cells. (A) The flow chart for proteomics and Kcr profiling.
  (B) GO and KEGG analyses showing the enrichment of differentially regulated proteins
  in lovastatin-treated MDA-MB-231 SFCs compared with MDA-MB-453 SFCs based on proteomics
  profiling. The top 5 enriched pathways are displayed. (C) GO and KEGG analyses showing
  the enrichment of differentially Kcr-modified proteins in lovastatin-treated MDA-MB-231
  SFCs compared with MDA-MB-453 SFCs based on Kcr profiling. The top 5 enriched pathways
  are displayed. (D and E) Representative confocal images of immunofluorescence staining
  for NPM (D) or NOLC1 (E) in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453 SFCs after treatment for 48
  h with lovastatin (0.3 μM) or vehicle. DIC images reveal the nucleoli (black arrows)
  as phase-dense structures. NPM and NOLC1 (white arrows) that locate to the nucleolus
  are indicated. Scale bar = 5 μm. (F) Levels of the precursor 45S rRNA and the mature
  28S and 5.8S rRNAs in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453 SFCs treated for 48 h with lovastatin
  (0.3 μM) or vehicle. (G and H) Representative confocal images of immunofluorescence
  staining for RPL3 (G) and p53 (H). Right, quantifications of fluorescence intensity
  of RPL3 (nuclear vs cytoplasmic) and p53, respectively. (I) Expression levels of
  p53 target genes in SFCs treated for 48 h with lovastatin (0.3 μM) or vehicle. **P
  < 0.01, ***P < 0.001; Kcr, lysine crotonylation; LV, lovastatin; Veh, vehicle; BP,
  biological process; MF, molecular function; CC, cellular component; DIC, differential
  interference contrast; ns, not significant.
