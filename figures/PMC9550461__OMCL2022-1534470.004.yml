caption: 'The mechanisms of CGRP in protecting against EC and VSMC injury. In ECs,
  CGRP improves endothelial function by increasing eNOS/NO expression, upregulating
  telomerase activity, and inhibiting ERK1/2-NOX4 via binding to its receptor complex
  CRLR/RAMP1. In VSMCs, CGRP attenuates apoptosis by inhibiting the CaMKII/CREB signaling
  pathway, inhibiting oxidative stress by blocking the Src/STAT3 signaling pathway,
  and protecting against inflammation via the EGFR-ERK1/2 pathway. Abbreviations:
  CGRP: calcitonin gene-related peptide; CRLR: calcitonin receptor-like receptor;
  RAMP: receptor activity-modifying protein; eNOS: endogenous nitric oxide synthase;
  NO: nitric oxide; ERK: extracellular regulated protein kinase; NOX: NADPH oxidase
  enzyme; CaMKII: calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; CREB: cAMP-responsive element-binding
  protein; STAT3: signal transducers and activators of transduction-3; EGFR: epidermal
  growth factor receptor; ECs: endothelial cells; VSMCs: vascular smooth muscle cells.'
