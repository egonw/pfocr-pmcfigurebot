caption: Mogharabi-Manzari et al. designed the synthesis of a high-performance heterogeneous
  catalyst by separately immobilizing laccase and TEMPO on magnetic nanoparticles.
  This catalyst was applied for the synthesis of benzimidazole from benzylic alcohols
  and o-phenylenediamines. Various products were afforded in good yields and the catalyst
  could be recycled for several runs without significant loss of catalytic activity.
  A reaction pathway was also described ().
