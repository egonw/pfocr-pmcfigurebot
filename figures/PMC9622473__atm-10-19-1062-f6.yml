caption: IPA based on different lipid metabolites among different groups. (A) IPA
  between HCs and CD patients before EEN; (B) IPA between CD patients before and after
  EEN. The P value (y-axis) and the pathway impact (x-axis) was represented by the
  color and the size of the circle, respectively. CD, Crohn’s disease; EEN, exclusive
  enteral nutrition; HCs, healthy controls; IPA, ingenuity pathway analysis.
