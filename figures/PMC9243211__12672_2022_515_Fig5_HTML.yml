caption: CD155 stimulates EC cellular proliferation and migration through the Hippo
  signaling pathway. AÂ Western blot analysis of CD155, pLATS1, pTAZ, TAZ, pYAP, and
  YAP in cells overexpressing or depleted of CD155. B Immunofluorescence analysis
  of YAP in cells overexpressing or depleted of CD155. red, YAP; blue, DAPI. C Quantification
  of immunofluorescence staining using ImageJ software. D Analysis of the nucleoplasmic
  ratio of B using ImageJ. E, F CCK8 analysis showed that verteporfin treatment reversed
  the pro-proliferative effect of CD155 overexpression in EC cells. G, H CCK-8 assay
  was performed to examine the effect of verteporfin (VP) in combination with irradiation
  on the proliferative capacity of esophageal cancer cell lines. I WB was performed
  to detect the expression levels of p-YAP and CD155 in esophageal cancer cells after
  irradiation. J WB for the effect of VP on CD155 and YAP
article_title: CD155 promotes radioresistance and malignancy of esophageal cancer
  by regulating Hippo-YAP pathway.
