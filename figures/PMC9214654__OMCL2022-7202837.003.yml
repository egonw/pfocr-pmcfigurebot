caption: 'LPS-induced TLR4 activation modulates functions of PMSCs via suppressing
  HH pathway. PMSCs were treated with SAG, cyclopamine, LPS and LPS+SAG separately.
  (a) Western blot analysis (a) of TLR4, SHH, SMO, and Gli1 protein expression and
  quantitative analysis of TLR4, SHH, SMO, and Gli1 in different groups of PMSCs.
  (b) Representative immunofluorescence images and quantification of double-fluorescent
  staining with SMO (red) and DAPI (blue). (c) CCK-8 assays were performed to determine
  the proliferation in different groups of PMSCs. (d) The apoptotic rates in different
  groups of PMSCs using flow cytometry assays. (e) The cell cycle phases of different
  groups of PMSCs were determined using flow cytometry assays. (f) Western blot analysis
  and densitometric quantification of p16 and p53 protein expressions in different
  groups of PMSCs. (g) SA-β-gal staining of PMSCs and the average ratio of SA-β-gal-positive
  cells in different groups of PMSCs. (h) Representative Transwell photos of PMSCs
  as well as the relative PMSC numbers of the Transwell quantified in different groups.
  (i) Western blot analysis and densitometric quantification of MMP9 protein expression
  in different groups of PMSCs. Scale bar: 200 μm. Data are presented as the mean
  ± SD. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001 by Student''s t-test
  and one-way ANOVA. SD: Standard deviation.'
