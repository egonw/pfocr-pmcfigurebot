caption: A, B Examination of protein expression in Caki/Cat D WT and KO cells or Cont
  and Cat D siRNA-transfected cancer cells. C Caki cells were pretreated with the
  indicated concentrations of Everolimus, and 2 μM Pep A was then added for 24 h.
  D Caki cells were transiently transfected with Cont siRNA or AMPK siRNA, and they
  were treated with 2 μM Pep A for 24 h. E Caki cells were pretreated with the indicated
  concentrations of Compound C, and 2 μM Pep A was then added for 24 h. F Cancer cells
  (Caki, HT29, and DU145) cells were transiently transfected with Cont siRNA or AMPK
  siRNA, and they were then treated with 2 μM Pep A for 24 h. G Caki cells were transiently
  transfected with Cont siRNA, LKB1 siRNA, TAK1 siRNA, or CaMKKβ siRNA, and they were
  treated with 2 μM Pep A for 24 h. H A549 and Caki cells were treated with the indicated
  concentrations of Pep A for 24 h. I Caki cells were pretreated with the indicated
  concentrations of SP600125 for 30 min, and they were then treated with 2 μM Pep
  A for 24 h. Protein expression was measured via western blotting (A–I).
