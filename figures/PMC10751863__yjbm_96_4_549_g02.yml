caption: Effect of Burn injury on Hippo signaling pathway in normal skin tissue. Second-degree
  deep burn injuries lead to formation of hypertrophic scars. The burn injury leads
  to conversion of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. Within these myofibroblasts, there
  is dysregulation of Hipposignaling pathway, which does not lead to phosphorylation
  of MST and LATS proteins, due to non-phosphorylation of these upstream proteins,
  the YAP protein remains unphosphorylated, and the unphosphorylated YAP enters the
  nucleus, which leads to activation of cell proliferation genes. The net result is
  excessive proliferation of myofibroblasts.
