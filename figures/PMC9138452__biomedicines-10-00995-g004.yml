caption: 'Hypothetical scheme: How can arachidonic acid (AA) accumulation in adipose
  tissue of obese individuals support tumor development and aggressiveness? In a lean
  individual, adipose tissue supplies to energy demand of tumor by adipocyte lipolysis
  and FA (Fatty Acid) transfer. In obesity context, the increased AA level of adipose
  tissue can potentiate the synthesis of PGE2 (by adipocytes and macrophages) and
  E2 (by adipocytes) providing molecules conducive to tumor proliferation and migration/invasion.
  Moreover, adipocyte lipolysis increases AA transfer to tumor cells that leads to
  an AA enrichment of tumor cells and their phospholipid membrane which feeds the
  pro-tumor AA signaling pathway. All words or arrows in red show an increase in molecules
  expression or activated/potentiated mechanism. AA: Arachidonic acid; COX-2: Cycloxygenase2;
  PGE2: Prostaglandine E2; E2: Estradiol; PGER3: Prostaglandine receptor 3; CLS: Crown-Like
  Structures, FA: Fatty acids. Based on knowledge provided by [,,,].'
