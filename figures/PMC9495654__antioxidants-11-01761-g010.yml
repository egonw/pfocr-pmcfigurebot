caption: Effects of withagenin A diglucoside (WAD) on the vascular endothelial growth
  factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) signaling pathway in human umbilical vein endothelial
  cells (HUVECs). HUVECs were treated with WAD (50 and 100 μM), U0126 (10 μM), and/or
  LY294002 (10 μM) for 24 h. Cells were treated with culture media containing 0.5%
  DMSO as vehicle controls. Protein expression levels of (A,B) phospho-VEGFR2), VEGFR2,
  (C,D) phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Phospho-ERK), ERK, (E–H) phospho-phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (Phospho-PI3K), PI3K, phospho-Akt, Akt, phospho-mammalian target of rapamycin
  (Phospho-mTOR), mTOR, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Each
  bar graph presents the densitometric quantification of protein expression levels.
  Data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). n = 3, * p <
  0.05 compared with the control.
