caption: 'Effects of licorice on reducing the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway. PI3K and
  AKT protein levels were detected using g western blotting. Quantification of the
  relative a p-PI3K and d p-AKT1 protein expressions, b p-PI3K/PI3K and e p-AKT1/AKT1
  ratios and total c PI3K and f AKT1 proteins. Data are presented as the mean ± standard
  mean error (n = 3). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.001 vs. Con
  group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001, and ####P < 0.0001 vs. LPS group. LPS,
