figure_title: Reduced neurotransmission and block of SV endocytosis due to PI(3)P
  depletion is Cdk5‐dependent
caption: 'Hypothetical signaling pathway for the induction of hyperactive Cdk5 induced
  by repression of VPS34 downstream of neuronal activity.Cdk5 inhibition by Roscovitine
  (Ros, 10 µM) rescues the progressive accumulation of Synaptophysin‐pHluorin on the
  neuronal surface induced by VPS34IN1 (10 µM). Neurons are stimulated and analyzed
  as in Fig . N = 4 independent experiments (20 images per condition); Two‐way ANOVA;
  Tukey’s Multiple Comparisons Test.Calcineurin inhibition by Cyclosporin A (10 µM)
  phenocopies VPS34IN1‐induced loss of PI(3)P with respect to the accumulation of
  Synaptophysin‐pHluorin on the neuronal surface after four successive stimulation
  trains (40 Hz, 5 s). Data were analyzed as in B. N = 3 independent experiments (15
  images per condition); Two‐way ANOVA; Tukey’s Multiple Comparison Test.Basal excitatory
  synaptic transmission of CA3‐CA1 connections in acute hippocampal slices treated
  with DMSO (0.03%), Roscovitine (Ros, 10 µM) or VPS34IN1 (3 µM) plus Roscovitine.
  Representative fEPSP traces (above) and the relative slope of fEPSPs (below) are
  shown. Concomitant application of VPS34IN1 and Roscovitine facilitates excitatory
  synaptic transmission, akin to Roscovitine alone, and in contrast to VPS34IN1 alone
  (compare Fig ). N = 6 slices per condition from 6 mice; Student’s t‐test.Decreased
  paired paired‐pulse facilitation (PPF) at hippocampal CA3‐CA1 synapses treated with
  Roscovitine alone (Ros, 10 µM) or VPS34IN1 (3 µM) plus Roscovitine. Representative
  traces of fEPSPs with a 20 ms interpulse interval is shown above. The ratio of the
  slope of the second to the first response over a range of interstimulus intervals
  (10–500 ms) is plotted below. The data show decreased facilitation of the second
  response in Roscovitine or VPS34IN1 plus Roscovitine‐treated acute hippocampal slices,
  unlike VPS34IN1 alone (compare Fig ). N = 6 slices per condition from 6 mice; Two‐way
  RM ANOVA. Data information: Data presented as mean ± SEM in all panels; n.s. not
  significant; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; p, t, q, df values are provided
  in the Source Data Statistics file. Source data are available online for this figure.'
