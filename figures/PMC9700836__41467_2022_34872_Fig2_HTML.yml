figure_title: circRNAs regulate the expression of interferon signals and pro-inflammatory
  cytokines in tumor cells
caption: 'a Pathway analysis showing top Reactome terms enriched upon knockdown of
  circCsnk1g3 (left) or circAnkib1 (right). Pathways are colored by Benjamini-Hochberg
  adjusted P value. b Validation by RTqPCR of the differential expression of interferon-related
  genes after silencing of circCsnk1g3, circAnkib1, and circBnc2. Dots represent n = 6
  independent biological replicates (minimum) and P values are derived from two-tailed
  one sample t test. c RPPA analysis of specific regulators of interferon signaling.
  d Validation and quantification of changes in pTBK (left) and IRF1 (right) expression
  in sarcoma cells after silencing of circCsnk1g3 (n = 12 pTBK and n = 8 IRF1) and
  circAnkib1 (n = 6 pTBK and n = 2 IRF1). Dots represent independent biological replicates,
  and one representative western blot is shown for each protein. P values derived
  from two-tailed one sample t test. e RTqPCR analysis of the differential expression
  of interferon-related genes after the silencing of the linear (mRNA) isoforms of
  Csnk1g3 and Ankib1. Dots represent n = 4 independent biological replicates (minimum)
  and P values are derived from two-tailed one sample t test. f Fractionation of nucleus/cytosol
  and quantification of circCsnk1g3 in the two distinct fractions. Gapdh (cytosolic)
  and U6 (nuclear) were used to validate the fractionation. Dots represent technical
  replicates of one experiment. g Schematic representation of the circFISH assay used
  to distinguish linear and circular isoforms and to map their sub-cellular localization.
  Using fluorescent probesets targeted to specific exons, the shared exons (linRNA
  and circRNA) were labeled with Cy5 (green) and the linRNA-only exons were labeled
  with Texas Red, such that linear transcripts appear as red or yellow signal, and
  circRNAs as green. h Representative pictures of the circFISH assay to detect circular
  and linear isoforms of Csnk1g3 and Ankib1, with overlaid circles in rightmost panels
  denoting detection of a linRNA (yellow or red circle) or circRNA (green circle).
  Top panels: untreated sarcoma cells. Lower panels: sarcoma cells treated with RNAseR.
  Representative pictures are shown from n ≥ 2 independent experiments. i Quantification
  of the circFISH assay for circCsnk1g3, linCsnk1g3 and circAnkib1, linAnkib1 in the
  RNaseR and untreated (NT) conditions. P values are derived from unpaired Student’s
  t test. For all bar plots, data are reported as mean fold-change ± s.e.m. unless
  otherwise noted. Source data are provided as Source Data File.'
