caption: Metabolomics and transcriptome analysis of S. baumii mycelia aerated for
  0 and 48 h. (A) Sixteen differential metabolites in the mycelia aerated for 0 h
  and 48 h. (B) Top 20 KEGG pathways with the most significant enrichment for mycelia
  aerated for 0 and 48 h. (C) Flavonoid biosynthesis pathway in S. baumii. Enzymes
  in the pathway are shown in blue. The red arrows up or down indicate increased or
  decreased gene expression after aeration, the red check mark indicates that the
  gene expression level has no significant change, and the black crosses indicate
  absence of such a homolog in S. baumii. PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; C4H, cinnamate
  4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone
  isomerase; FNS, flavone synthase; F3H, flavanone-3-hydroxylase; FLS, flavonol synthase;
  IFS, 2-hydroxy isoflavone synthase; IFD, 2-hydroxyl isoflavone dehydrase; IFR, isoflavone
  reductase. (D) Verification of differentially expressed genes by quantitative real-time
  polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Bars show transcriptome data and lines show
  qRT-PCR data. PKS, polyketone synthase gene.
