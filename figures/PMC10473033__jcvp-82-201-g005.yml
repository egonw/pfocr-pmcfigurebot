caption: 'Changes in α-SMA expression after sRLX treatment. A, Immunostaining for
  α-SMA. Bar = 100 µm. A, Expression of α-SMA mRNA was assessed by RT-PCR. B, Expression
  of α-SMA was assessed by western blotting. C, Statistical analysis of α-SMA expression.
  sRLX inhibits α-SMA expression in TGF-β1-induced cells. Data are represented as
  the mean ± SD from 5 independent experiments performed in duplicate. *P < 0.05 versus
  control group, #P < 0.05 versus LPS group. &P < 0.05 versus LPS + sRLX group. GW,
  GW9662.'
