caption: PFWE decreased the expression of cytokines and chemokines in the lungs. The
  levels of (a) IL-6 and (b) CCL2/MCP-1 were detected by ELISA in the BALF (n = 8–10
  in each group). The gene expressions of (c) IL-6 and (d) CCL2/MCP-1 were determined
  by q-PCR in the lungs (n = 10 in each group). Mice groups were divided, as shown
  in . The data are presented as mean ± SEM (∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01) compared with
  the LPS-stimulated group and analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
  with the Kruskal–Wallis test.
