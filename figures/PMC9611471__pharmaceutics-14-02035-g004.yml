caption: Effects of Compounds 2 and 4 on apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential
  in A549 cells; (a) A549 cells were treated with Compounds 2, 4 and PF-543 of the
  desired concentration, and apoptosis analysis was performed with annexin V-FITC
  assay; (b) The mitochondrial outer membrane potential was measured using a JC-10
  dye and analyzed by the flow cytometer; (c) The expression of apoptosis pathway
  proteins was observed after 24 h treatment with PF-543 and PF-543 derivatives at
  concentrations of 5 and 10 µM in A549 cells. β-actin was used as the loading control.
  Western blots are representative of three independent experiments. Data are expressed
  as the mean ± S.D. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 compared with control
  group.
