caption: Variation in gene expression between matched patient tumor and ascites. A,
  Diagram of ovarian cancer primary tumor and ascites cells. B, Table of individual
  patient’s primary tumor and ascites transcriptional subtype assignment (Wang et
  al. 2017). Only 38% (n = 12) of patients had the same transcriptional subtype assigned
  to their primary tumor tissue and ascites. C, RNA-seq was performed on 32 patient
  ascites samples and matched to the same patient’s primary untreated tumor tissue.
  Hierarchical clustering of primary tumor, benign tissue, and ascites cells based
  on the most variable genes separates benign tissue from tumor tissue types. Kaplan–Meier
  (KM) curves showing the effects of WNT pathway activity (D) and TIL levels in ascites
  on progression-free survival of patients with HGSOC (E).
