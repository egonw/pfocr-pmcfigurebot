caption: 'Expression of the TIAM2 gene affects the phosphorylation of key components
  in the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. A: Western blotting was used to detect the protein levels
  of JAK2, p-JAK2, STAT3, and p-STAT3 in siNC and siTIAM2 cells. B, C: Silencing of
  TIAM2 reduced the ratio of p-STAT3/STAT3 and p-JAK2/JAK2 in the 143B and U2OS cell
  lines. D: Western blotting was used to detect the protein levels of JAK2, p-JAK2,
  STAT3, and p-STAT3 in TIAM2-OE and control cells. E, F: Overexpression of TIAM2
  increased the ratio of p-STAT3/STAT3 and p-JAK2/JAK2 in the 143B and U2OS cell lines.
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.'
