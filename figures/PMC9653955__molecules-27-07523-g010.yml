caption: Quantitative PCR-based determination of the RNA steady state level in HTB75
  (a,b) and HTB161 (c,d) cell lines of FZD4 and FZD1 genes at 6 h of treatment with
  F7 or F7+CB2 IA, relative to control. Gene transcript values were determined by
  quantitative PCR as a difference between the target gene versus a reference gene
  (HPRT). Values were calculated relative to the average expression of target genes
  in treated versus control using the 2−ΔΔCt method. Control was the vehicle control
  (1.00% v/v methanol + 0.10% v/v DMSO). Error bars indicate ± S.E. (n = 3). Levels
  with different Upper case letters were significantly different from all combinations
  of pairs by Tukey-Kramer honest significant difference (HSD; p ≤ 0.05).
