caption: 'Effects of CBD on PKA, p-PKA, CREB, and p-CREB in the left ventricle of
  the MA-induced rats. The expression levels of PKA and p-PKA (A), CREB, and p-CREB
  (B) were measured by Western blot analysis. The data are expressed as the mean Â±
  SD. *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01 vs. control group. #, P<0.05; ##, P<0.01; ###, P<0.001
  vs. MA group. CBD, cannabidiol; CREB, cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element-binding
  protein; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; MA, methamphetamine; PKA,
  protein kinase A; SD, standard deviation.'
