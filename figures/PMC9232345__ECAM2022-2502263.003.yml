caption: 'Protective effect of β-carotene is related to inhibited autophagy in LPS-treated
  IEC-6 cells. Cells were exposed to LPS (100 μM) for 3 h followed by incubation with
  β-carotene (10 μM) with or without RAPA (10 μM) for 24 h. (a) Cell viability measured
  by the CCK-8 assay. (b), (c) Apoptosis quantified by flow cytometry. (d)–(g) The
  protein expressions of Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3, LC3II/I, and p62 detected
  by Western blot. (h) The formation of GFP-LC3 puncta detected by immunofluorescence.
  The images were made at × 100 magnification.  ∗ ∗P < 0.01 vs. the LPS group. ##P
  < 0.01 vs. the LPS + βC group.'
