caption: Cell division cycle 25B (CDC25B) is a downstream gene affected by cyclin‐dependent
  kinase 5 (CDK5). (A) Western blot analysis of key genes related to the cell cycle
  is illustrated. Glyceraldehyde 3‐phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) served as a control.
  sh‐NC indicates short hairpin negative control. (B) Western blot analysis was used
  to detect CDK5 and CDC25B protein expression in SCC25‐shCDK5 cells after knock‐down
  of CDC25B. GAPDH served as a control. si‐CDC25B indicates small interfering CDC25B;
  TSCC, tongue squamous cell carcinoma. (C) Western blot analysis was used to detect
  the expression of proteins related to the cell cycle in SCC25‐shCDK5 cells. GAPDH
  served as a control. Mut indicates mutant; WT, wild type. (D) Polymerase chain reaction
  analysis of CDK5 and CDC25B messenger RNA expression is illustrated in overexpressing
  CDK5 (OE‐CDK5) and sh‐CDK5 cells and their respective negative control cells. (E)
  After transfection with si‐CDC25B or negative control (si‐NC), the cell cycle of
  SCC25‐shCDK5 cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. PE‐A indicates phycoerythrin
  assay; PI‐A, propidium iodide assay. All data points represent mean ± standard deviation
  values. A single asterisk indicates P < .05; double asterisks, P < .01.
article_title: Cyclin‐dependent kinase 5 promotes the growth of tongue squamous cell
  carcinoma through the microRNA 513c‐5p/cell division cycle 25B pathway and is associated
  with a poor prognosis.
