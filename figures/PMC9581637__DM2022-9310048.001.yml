caption: DLEU2 is a new potential target that promotes oral cancer development. (a)
  Hierarchical clustering heat map shows differentially expressed lncRNA including
  DLEU2 between the oral cancer and control groups. (b) Relative expression of DLEU2
  in RWPE-2 and four oral cancer cell lines (C4-2, 22RV1, Tca8113, and CAL-27). (c)
  RT-qPCR analysis of the inhibition efficiency of 3 si-DLEU2 in Tca8113 and CAL-27
  cells. (d, e) CCK8 analysis of the effect of si-DLEU2 on the proliferation rate
  of Tca8113 (d) and CAL-27 (e) cells. (f, g) Transwell analysis of the effects of
  si-DLEU2 on migration and invasion of Tca8113 (f) and CAL-27 (g) cells. (h) RT-qPCR
  analysis of DLEU2 localization in Tca8113 and CAL-27 cells. âˆ—P < 0.05.
