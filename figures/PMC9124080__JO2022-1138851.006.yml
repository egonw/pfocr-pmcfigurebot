caption: 'Knockdown of FOXO3 notably reversed the effect of 6,7-dimethoxycoumarin
  on the expression of FOXO3 and cell cycle relevant proteins. (a) The expression
  of proteins was detected by western blot assay. (b) The expression of FOXO3 was
  detected by immunofluorescence assay. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, compared with control
  group. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, compared with 6,7-Doc group.'
