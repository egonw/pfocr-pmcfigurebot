caption: Enhanced plant resistance by JR48 on Chinese cabbage. (A, B) Disease symptoms
  and bacterial infection on Chinese cabbage. Suspensions of Xcc 8004 were inoculated
  on leaves of pre-treated Chinese cabbage by clipping. Representative photographs
  (A) were taken at 10 days post inoculation, lesion area were measured at the same
  time. Data presented are means ± SD (n ≥ 16), ** indicates significant differences
  (P < 0.01, Student’s t-test). Populations of leaf bacteria (B) were counted at 5
  days post inoculation (mean ± SD; n ≥ 6; **P < 0.01, Student’s t-test). This experiment
  was repeated three times with similar results. (C) Activities of defense-related
  enzymes during pathogen infection. Chinese cabbage plants were pre-treated and inoculated
  with Xcc 8004 after 3 days. Leaf tissues near the incision were homogenized to determine
  the activities of PAL and PPO at the indicated time points. The values are means
  ± SD (n ≥ 12) and significant differences (**P < 0.01) were assessed with Student’s
  t-test. Experiments were repeated in triplicate. (D) A schematic diagram illustrating
  that JR48 induces plant resistance and defense responses to the crucifer black rot
  via a SA-dependent signaling pathway. Left dotted box indicates normal Xcc infection
  on Arabidopsis, and small orange rectangles with rounded corners represent Xcc.
  Right dotted box indicates reduced Xcc infection on Arabidopsis under JR48 treatment,
  and small blue rectangles with rounded corners represent JR48. One-way solid arrows
  indicate direct signal transduction and promotion demonstrated in this study, and
  a dotted arrow indicates indirect promotion.
