caption: Glutathione metabolism pathway modulation following IR is accentuated in
  response to FtH deficiency. KEGG analyses of RNA-sequencing data showing the top
  10 enriched pathways using (A) Enrichr platform and (B) Ingenuity pathways analysis
  platform between FtHfl/fl and FtHSM22Δ/Δ samples. Both analyses identify the glutathione
  metabolism pathway as the top canonical pathway differently modulated between genotypes
  in response to IR. n = 3/group.
