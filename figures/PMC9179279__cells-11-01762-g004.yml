caption: Tumor cells with copy number losses in multiple autophagy genes maintain
  proliferation under metabolic stress. (a) Western blot of indicated cells for autophagy
  genes. β-Actin is shown as loading control. (b) Clonogenic growth assay. (c–e) Real-time
  live cell imaging of cells under treatment. (c,d) Proliferation curves. Shown is
  the mean confluence in % over time (n = 3). (e) AUC of proliferation curves in (c,d)
  relative to untreated. Shown is the mean ± SD (n = 3). Differential treatment responses
  were tested for statistical significance by 2-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s multiple comparisons
  test. p-values denote pairwise comparisons of mutant with parental wild-type cells;
  ***, p < 0.0001; **, p < 0.001; and *, p < 0.01. UN, untreated.
