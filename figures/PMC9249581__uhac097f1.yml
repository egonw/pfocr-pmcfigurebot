caption: a) Bronze tomato ripening stages (MG, mature green; B, breaker; B + 7, breaker
  +7 days; R, ripe); b) Antioxidant capacity of methanolic extracts from fruits measured
  by TEAC assay; c) Total content of polyphenols measured by Folin–Ciocalteu; d) Soluble
  solutes, defined by the Brix degrees, measured in aqueous extracts from fruits at
  the four ripening stages. Significance assumed at *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
