caption: Model for the regulation of HEMO expression in cancer. A ‘MER34 retrovirus’
  was endogenized in an ancestral mammal genome about 100 mya, as a multi‐copy ERV
  family. Following genetic evolution, only one env ORF remains present in human genome
  on chromosome 4, having lost its 5′ LTR and being transcribed from a cellular CpG‐rich
  promoter. This sequence was previously described as HEMO (Human Endogenous MER34
  ORF) []. Methylation of its promoter could participate in the HEMO silencing in
  somatic cells (*CpG methylation). In cancer, besides epigenetic modifications, such
  as hypomethylation of the HEMO promoter, we propose that the Wnt/β‐catenin pathway
  is an upstream regulator of HEMO expression. Activation of this signaling pathway,
  due to genetic or epigenetic alterations, is frequently observed in tumors and results
  in the accumulation of β‐catenin and its subsequent translocation to the nucleus
  of the tumor cell. Once in the nuclear compartment, β‐catenin associates with TCF
  to form a complex that binds WREs (‘Wnt Responsive Elements’) and thus activates
  transcription of numerous target genes. Among them, transcription factors could
  in turn activate HEMO transcription. Alternatively, HEMO could directly be activated
  by the β‐catenin/TCF complex. These mechanisms could also drive HEMO activation
  in stem cells and placenta where this gene is expressed as membrane and shed HEMO
  proteins []. mb, membrane; LTR, long terminal repeat; TF, transcription factor,
  TFBS, transcription factor binding site.
