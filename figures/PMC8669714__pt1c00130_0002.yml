caption: 'Autophagy pathway and crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis. (a) Components
  of the autophagy pathway are illustrated. The pathway is initiated by the ULK1/2
  complex (red), which consists of ULK1 or ULK2, Atg13, FIP200, and Atg101. AMPK positively
  and mTORC1 negatively regulates the ULK1/2 complex. The Vps34-beclin1 complex (green)
  consists of Vps34, beclin1, p150, Atg14, and PI3K-III. The Vps34-beclin1 complex
  regulates the formation of the isolation membrane. Expansion of the phagophore is
  modulated by two ubiquitin-like frameworks: the Atg12 system (purple), Atg12, Atg7,
  Atg5, Atg10, and Atg15, and the Atg8 system (yellow), LC3, Atg4, Atg5, and Atg7.
  Atg2 (cyan) functions in autophagosome formation. At later stages, the autophagosome
  fuses with the lysosome to form the autolysosome. Here components are degraded and
  released back into the cell. (b) Mitophagy regulates mitochondria outer membrane
  permeabilization (MOMP). Mitophagy removes damaged or unwanted mitochondria, which
  increases the threshold for MOMP and cyto c release. Cytosolic cytochrome c activates
  apoptosis and can inhibit mitophagy by activating caspase-8. (c) Formation of intracellular
  death-induced signaling complexes at the autophagosome membranes modulates in crosstalk
  between autophagy and apoptosis. Atg5-Atg12-Atg16L bound to the autophagosomal membrane
  forms a complex with FADD and caspase-8 to induce apoptosis. Similarly, LC3-II and
  p62 can bind caspase-8 and initial programmed cell death.'
