caption: Tentative biodegradation pathway for poly(caprolactone) (PCL) in aerobic
  conditions. PCL is enzymatically hydrolyzed by extracellular enzymes, namely lipase,
  esterase and cutinase to 6-hydroxycaproic acid. 6-Hydroxycaproic acid is metabolized
  via Î²-oxidation to acetyl-CoA units, which is later metabolized through the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle to produce energy, releasing CO2 and water. Adapted from [].
