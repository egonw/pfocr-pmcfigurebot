caption: Identification of potential regulatory pathway. (A and C) Enrichment analysis
  of DEGs regulating the immune‐related genes in BCG‐823 and HGC‐27 stomach cancer
  cells. The bar chart shows normalized enrichment score (NES) in GSEA with direction
  and the false discovery rate (FDR) for the categories is ≤0.05. (B and D) GSEA enrichment
  plot showing the rank distribution and enrichment score of CCRI. (E) RNA seq results
  were used to estimate the relative proportion of tumour‐infiltrating immune cells
article_title: Systematic molecular analysis of the human secretome and membrane proteome
  in gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas.
