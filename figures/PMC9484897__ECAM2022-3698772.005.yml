caption: 'Effect of ferroptosis activation on migration and invasion of EC cells.
  (a) Transmission electron microscopy observation of Eca109 and KYSE150 cells (15000x,
  scale bar, 500 nm); (b) results of Eca109 and KYSE150 cells scratch assay (Scale
  bar, 100 μm); (c) Transwell invasion assay of Eca109 and KYSE150 cells (crystal
  violet staining, 400x, Scale bar, 50 μm); (d) Eca109 and KYSE150 cells migration;
  (e) the number of membrane piercing in Eca109 and KYSE150 cells; (f) the expression
  of E-cadherin, Slug, and N-cadherin in Eca109 and KYSE150 cells was determined using
  western blot analysis. The data were expressed after being normalized to β-actin.
  The data are expressed as the mean ± SD. Compared with the control group, ∗P < 0.05
  and ∗∗P < 0.01; compared with the 2IC50 group, #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01.'
