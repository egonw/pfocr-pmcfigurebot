caption: 'Aging alters acetylcholine (ACh) level, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT),
  and acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activities in the hippocampus of WT and GPx-1
  KO mice; effects of MCG. Changes in ACh level (A), ChAT activity (B), and AChE activity
  (C) over time. M = months old. Each value represents the mean ± S.E.M. of 8 animals.
  ∗P < 0.05 vs. corresponding 3 M. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 vs. corresponding WT. +P<0.05
  vs. corresponding 6 M. Two-way ANOVA followed by Fisher''s LSD pairwise comparisons
  were used to analyze the data.'
