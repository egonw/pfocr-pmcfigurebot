caption: 'C-176 treatment relieved pain and pain-related anxiety by inhibiting the
  TBK1-NF-κB signaling pathway in the mPFC of CIBP rats. (A) Compared with vehicle
  (corn oil, 200 µL, i.p.), injection of C-176 (5.25μmol in 200 µL corn oil, i.p.)
  significantly decreased the level of the paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) (Left) and
  limb use score (Right) of CIBP rats. (B) The tracks and analysis of elevated plus-maze
  experiment. Representative activity traces of sham (a), CIBP + vehicle (b), and
  CIBP + C-176 (c) in the elevated plus-maze experiment are shown. (d) Percentage
  of open arm retention time was analyzed’, n = 3. (C) The protein expression of the
  rate of p-TBK1/TBK1 in sham, CIBP + vehicle, and CIBP + C-176 group were determined
  using Western blots. (D) The protein expression of the rate of p-NF-κB/NF-κB in
  sham, CIBP + vehicle, and CIBP + C-176 group were determined using Western blots.
  GAPDH was detected as an internal control. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E.M.,
  n = 4. ** p < 0.01 vs. sham, #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01 vs. CIBP + vehicle. Full pictures
  of the Western blots are presented in .'
