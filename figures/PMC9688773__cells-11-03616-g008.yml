caption: '(A) Pathway of cholesterol synthesis in the brain from acetylCoA reduction
  by HMGC reductase, through the action of 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7)
  and 3β-hydroxysterol 24-reductase (DHCR24); its catabolism involves the formation
  of various catabolites by the actions of several enzymes such as cytochrome P450
  family 46 subfamily A member 1 (CYP46a1) and hydroxy-delta-5-steroid dehydrogenase,
  3 beta- and steroid delta-isomerase 7 (HSD3b7); (B) Pathway of PC and PE synthesis
  []. Abbreviations: PCCT—phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, encoded by Pcyt1b;
  PECT—phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase, encoded by Pcyt2; CDP-choline—cytidil-5-diphosphocholine;
  CDP-ethanolamine—cytidil-5-diphosphoethanolamine; PC—phosphatidylcholine; PE—phosphatirylethanolamine;
  PEMT—phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransfera.se.'
