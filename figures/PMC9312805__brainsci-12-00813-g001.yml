caption: 'Disorder of astrocyte formation and decreased expression of TBCB after 1,
  6, 12, and 24 h of acute foetal alcohol exposure. (A–E) Immunofluorescence showing
  changes in the expression of α-tubulin (red signal) and TBCB (green signal) in astrocytes
  after 1, 6, 12, and 24 h of acute foetal alcohol exposure. Panels A-E 4-6 are magnified
  images from the square area of Panels A-E 1-3. (F) The number of astrocyte processes
  and mean grey value (MGV) of TBCB and MT in astrocyte processes (MGV = integrated
  density/area) after 1, 6, 12, and 24 h of acute foetal alcohol exposure. (G) Western
  blot and (H) RT–PCR analysis of the protein and mRNA levels of TBCB and α-tubulin
  after 1, 6, 12, and 24 h of acute foetal alcohol exposure (n = 6, p < 0.05). *:
  p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01, ***: p < 0.001, ****: p < 0.0001.'
