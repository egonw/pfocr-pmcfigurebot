figure_title: Functional enrichment analysis of DEGs obtained from RNA-seq
caption: A KEGG enrichment analysis of upregulated DEGs. B KEGG enrichment analysis
  of downregulated DEGs. The outermost circle on the right represents the term in
  the lower right corner, and the inner circle on the right represents the P value
  of the corresponding pathway. Câ€“F GSEA enrichment analysis between the DMSO group
  and the fatostatin group. NES normalized enrichment score.
