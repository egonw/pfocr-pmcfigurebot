caption: Correlation between the cell proliferation-related scores and drug response.
  Correlation plots of the association in human pancreatic cancer cell lines between
  six proliferation-related gene set score and sensitivity to pancreatic cancer drugs,
  including Gemcitabine, Paclitaxel, Apatinib, Palbociclib, Sorafenib, and Sunitinib.
  P-value and rho (r) were analyzed with spearmanâ€™s rank correlation coefficient.
  G2M, G2M Checkpoint; E2F, E2F Targets; MYC1, MYC Targets V1; MYC2, MYC Targets V2;
  Mitotic, Mitotic Spindle; p53, p53 pathway.
article_title: G2M checkpoint pathway alone is associated with drug response and survival
  among cell proliferation-related pathways in pancreatic cancer.
