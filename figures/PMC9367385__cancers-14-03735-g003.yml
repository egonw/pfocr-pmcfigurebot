caption: 'Overexpressed SH3TC2 indicated poor clinical prognosis. (A) Representative
  SH3TC2 IHC staining of clinical specimens. In our cohort, expression of SH3TC2 was
  significantly upregulated in tumor tissues compared with nontumor tissues (NTTs).
  (B) SH3TC2 is upregulated in advanced CRC patients (TNM III and IV stages). (C)
  Expression of SH3TC2 is not related to tumor differentiation. (D) Kaplan-Meier analysis
  of CRC patients with high or low expression of SH3TC2. Patients with higher SH3TC2
  expression had poor DFS. Statistical analysis was compared between two groups: ns,
  not significant; *** p < 0.001.'
