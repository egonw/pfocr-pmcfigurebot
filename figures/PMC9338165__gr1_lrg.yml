caption: RNA-seq and hallmark gene set enrichment analysis of RNA isolated from peripheral
  mononuclear cells reveals alterations of “interferon gamma response” in patients
  randomized to remdesivir (REM, n = 8) compared to standard of care (SOC, n = 7)
  (A), with dampened enrichment of this pathway in patients receiving remdesivir (B),
  and differential expression analysis of interferon-stimulated genes between the
  two treatment arms (C).
