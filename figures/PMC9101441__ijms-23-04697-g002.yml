caption: Urolithin A (Uro-A) suppressed TLR3 pathway protein expression in poly(I:C)-stimulated
  RAW264.7 cells. (A) TLR3 protein expression. (B) Fold-change in TLR3 expression
  relative to β-actin expression. (C) TRIF protein expression. (D) Fold--change in
  TRIF expression relative to β-actin expression. (E) pIRF3 and IRF3 protein expression.
  (F) Fold-change in pIRF3 expression relative to IRF3 expression. RAW264.7 cells
  were precultured with various concentrations of Uro-A, and then incubated with poly(I:C)
  (1 μg/mL) for 30 min or 24 h. Data are presented as mean ± SD. * p < 0.05, ** p
  < 0.01 compared to RAW264.7 cells stimulated with poly(I:C) alone.
