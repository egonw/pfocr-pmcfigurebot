caption: IGF2BP1 recognizes and regulates MDM2 mRNA in an m6A-dependent manner. (A)
  Venn diagram showing the intersection of DEGs from RNA-seq and enriched transcripts
  from IGF2BP1 RIP-seq. (B) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of genes obtained from
  the intersection. (C) Venn diagram showing the intersection of KEGG pathway ‘Cell
  cycle’, ‘p53 signaling pathway’, ‘FoxO signaling pathway’ and ‘Cellular senescence’.
  (D, E) RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis of mRNA and protein levels of MDM2 in COV434 cells
  after 3-NP treatment and IGF2BP1 knockdown/overexpression. a, lane1 vs 2; b, lane3
  vs 4; (F) RT-qPCR analysis of MDM2 mRNA levels 0/3/6h after ActD treatment in IGF2BP1
  depleted/overexpressed COV434 cells. (G) Map of SRAMP-predicted m6A sites and IGF2BP1-RIP
  peaks on MDM2 mRNA. (H) Co-purification of MDM2 mRNAs with IGF2BP1 in wildtype,
  control- (siCTRL) or METTL3-depleted(siMETTL3) COV434 cells was analyzed by RIP
  using anti-IGF2BP1 antibodies and RT-qPCR analysis. (I) RT-qPCR and Western blot
  analysis of mRNA and protein levels of MDM2 in COV434 cells after IGF2BP1 overexpression
  and/or METTL3 knockdown. a, lane2 vs 1, P < 0.001; b, lane3 vs 1, P < 0.01. (J)
  Schematic representation showing the reporters harboring wildtype or m6A-enriched-region
  deleted fragments of SOX2-3′UTR (left panel). Dual luciferase reporter analysis
  of MDM2-3′UTR-driven firefly luciferase reporter constructs in COV434 cells with
  ectopically expressed IGF2BP1 (right panel). ns, not statistically significant;
  *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001.
