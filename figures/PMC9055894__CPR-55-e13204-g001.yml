caption: Data analysis showing complement over‐activation in COVID‐RS placenta. (A)
  Cellchat analysis showing complement signalling networks among different cell subsets
  in COVID‐RS and CTRL cases. The Receiver and Sender are listed at X and Y axis respectively;
  (B) Violin plot showing the expression of several critical ligand–receptor pairs
  in the complement pathway, including C1R, C1S, C3, C3AR1 and C5AR1, in all subsets
  from COVID‐RS and CTRL placenta; (C) Immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry
  showing the activated C3 deposition in the COVID‐RS placenta. Villous trophoblasts
  and macrophages are labelled by the staining for CK7 and CD68 respectively. The
  black arrows shows the accumulation of C5aR1‐expressing macrophages; (D) CellphoneDB
  analysis showing the complement activation–related ligand–receptor pairs among subsets
  in COVID‐RS and CTRL placenta. The size of dots represents mean value, and the colour
  shows −log(pvals +1e‐04)
