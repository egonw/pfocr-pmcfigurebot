caption: Silencing DPP-4 promotes autophagy and HIF-1α in breast cancer cells. (A).
  Western blot analysis of DPP-4, LC3, and p62 in MCF 10A, MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and 4T1
  cells treated for 48 h in the presence or absence of DPP-4 siRNA (100 nM). Densitometric
  analysis of p62 levels normalized to β-actin levels and LC3II levels normalized
  to LC3I levels (n = 3 per group). (B). Western blot analysis of CXCL12, CXCR4, p-mTOR,
  and HIF-1α in MCF 10A, MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and 4T1 cells, treated with or without
  DPP-4 siRNA (100 nM). Densitometric analysis of HIF-1α levels relative to β-actin
  levels (n = 3 per group). The data in the graph are presented as the mean ± SEM.
  NS, not significant.
