caption: RNA-seq analyze the effect of Nephropathy 1st on PPARγ expression. The scatter
  diagram shows the KEGG enrichment analysis of different genes between control vs.
  UUO (A) and the UUO vs. Nephropathy 1st (B) group. The expression of different genes
  from the pathway of oxidative stress inflammation using NGS. (C). Expression of
  PPARγ, JAK1, Akt1, and NF-κB in different groups was detected. (D). Western blot
  was performed to assess the expression of PPARγ and Klotho. Data were representative
  of three independent experiments. **p < 0.01.
article_title: Nephropathy 1st inhibits renal fibrosis by activating the PPARγ signaling
  pathway.
