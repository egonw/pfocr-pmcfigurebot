caption: NF-κB signaling pathway was involved in the ameliorative effect of NLRP3-KO
  on lung injury. (a) Representative western blot bands for p65, p-p65, ASC, CL-Cas1,
  IL-1β, and IL-18. (b ~ f) Quantification of ASC/GAPDH, CL-Cas1/GAPDH, IL-1β/GAPDH,
  IL-18/GAPDH, and p-p65/GAPDH, respectively. The data are presented as the mean ±
  SEM. n = 5 per group. AP < 0.05 vs. Sham; BP < 0.05 vs. WT.
