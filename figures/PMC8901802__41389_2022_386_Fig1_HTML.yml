figure_title: PSMC2 was upregulated in gastric cancer and the role of PSMC2 in gastric
  cancer cells was studied. (AGS and MGC-803 cells)
caption: A Immumohistochemical staining was conducted to evaluate the expression of
  PSMC2 in the gastric cancer tissues and para-carcinoma tissues. B Kaplan–Meier was
  performed to analyze the relationship between PSMC2 expression and overall survival
  rate of patients with gastric cancer. C The results of MTT assay showed that after
  PSMC2 was knocked down, the proliferation fold of gastric cancer cells was significantly
  reduced. D The results of clone formation assay indicated that downregulation of
  PMSC2 inhibited the clone formation ability of gastric cancer cells (AGS and MGC-803).
  E Flow cytometry was performed to evaluate the apoptosis level of gastric cancer
  cells infected with shPSMC2 or shCtrl lentivirus. F Transwell assay was conducted
  to determine the changes in the migration ability of gastric cancer cells after
  knocking down PSMC2. G Wound healing assay was conducted to determine the changes
  in the migration ability of gastric cancer cells after knocking down PSMC2. *P < 0.05;
  **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001, compared with shCtrl group. Error bars meant SD.
