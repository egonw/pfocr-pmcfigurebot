caption: Enrichment of reactions with differential flux. The enrichment of up-regulated
  (A) and down-regulated (B) metabolic reactions based on subsystem by hypergeometric
  test. The bigger the bubble size, the larger the number of reactions enriched in
  subsystems. The darker the color, the higher the reaction enrichment level in subsystems.
  p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Arg, arginine; Pro, proline;
  Gly, glycine; Ser, serine; Thr, threonine; Cys, cysteine; Met, methionine; Ala,
  alanine; Asp, aspartate; Glu, glutamate; Lys, lysine; Tyr, tyrosine; Trp, tryptophan;
  Phe, phenylalanine; His, histidine; β-Ala, β-alanine; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle
  and glyoxylate/dicarboxylate metabolism; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway.
