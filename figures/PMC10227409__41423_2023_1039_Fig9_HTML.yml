caption: Role of the STING pathway in MDM and pDC activation. STING signaling was
  inhibited using the inhibitor H-151 (10 µM). The duration of stimulation for all
  cultures was 18 h. A IFN-α levels in pDC cultures stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 supernatants.
  B, C IL-6 and TNF levels in pDC cultures stimulated with CpG2006. D, E IL-6 and
  TNF levels in cultures of MDMs that were stimulated with cGAMP or LPS for 18 h in
  the absence or presence of H-151. F, G IL-6 and TNF levels in MDM-φ-VeroE6inf cultures.
  H–J IFN-α, IL-6 and TNF levels in cocultures of pDCs and MDM-φ-VeroE6inf. In (A)–(C),
  cells from 6 to 9 different blood donors were used in single replicates. In (D)
  and (E), cells from 5 to 6 donors in duplicate were used. In (F) and (G), cells
  from 3 to 6 different donors were run in triplicates. In (H)–(J), cells from 5 to
  9 different donors run in single replicates were used. The results are presented
  as scatter plots with bars indicating the mean ± standard deviation. Statistically
  significant differences in the cytokine levels between mock and treated cells are
  indicated by asterisks, and differences between other conditions are indicated by
  asterisks on a bar (*p < 0.05, **p ≤ 0.002, ***p ≤ 0.001 and ****p ≤ 0.0001)
