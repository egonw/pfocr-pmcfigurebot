caption: Effects of cordycepin and CHIR99021 on GSK3β expression. A. GSK3β protein
  expression in HT-29 and LoVo cells was detected by Western blot after treatment
  with different concentrations of cordycepin (control, 20 µM, 40 µM and 80 µM). B.
  GSK3β protein expression in HT-29 and LoVo cells was detected by Western blot after
  co-treatment with 80 μM cordycepin and 10 μM CHIR99021. All experiments were repeated
  at least 3 times and were performed in triplicates, and data were presented as mean
  ± SD. ***; P<0.001.
