caption: DKK4 inhibits CRC cell migration and invasion.A, DKK4 overexpression models
  were successfully constructed, as detected by Western blot and qRT‒PCR. ∗∗p < 0.01.
  B, DKK4 knockdown models were successfully constructed, as detected by Western blot
  and qRT‒PCR. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01. C and D, transwell assays showing the migration
  and invasion abilities of Caco-2 (C) and HCT8 (D) cells infected with LV-DKK4 and
  negative controls. The scale bars represent 200 μm. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01. E and
  F, transwell assays showing the migration and invasion abilities of SW480 (E) and
  HCT116 (F) cells infected with LV-shDKK4 and negative controls. The scale bars represent
  200 μm. ∗∗p < 0.01. G, the cell proliferation capacity of DKK4-overexpressing Caco-2
  and HCT8 cells detected by CCK-8 assay. N.S., not significant. H, the cell proliferation
  capacity of DKK4-knockdown SW480 and HCT116 cells detected by CCK-8 assay. N.S.,
  not significant. CCK-8, cell counting kit-8; CRC, colorectal cancer; LV-DKK4, Lentivirus
  carrying the human DKK4 gene; qRT‒PCR, quantitative real-time PCR.
