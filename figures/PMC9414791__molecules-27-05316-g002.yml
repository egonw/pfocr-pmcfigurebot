caption: 'Protective effect of 80% ethanolic extract from Gimcheon 1ho (GC) cultivar
  walnut (Juglans regia): (a) cell viability from H2O2-induced cytotoxicity in PC12
  cells; (b) cell viability from high-glucose-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells;
  (c) cell viability from H2O2-induced cytotoxicity in HT22 cells; (d) cell viability
  from high glucose-induced cytotoxicity in HT22 cells. Results shown are mean ± SD
  (n = 3). Data are statistically represented with * = significantly different from
  the NC group, and # = significantly different from PM group; * and # p < 0.05, **
  and ##p < 0.01. Bold line indicates mean.'
