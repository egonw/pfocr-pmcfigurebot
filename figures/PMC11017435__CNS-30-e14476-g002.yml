caption: Apoptosis is triggered by the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. The intrinsic
  pathway is activated by BAK and BAX. BAK/BAX oligomers form pores, leading to the
  release of Cytochrome c into the cytosol. Activation of BAK/BAX is promoted by BID
  or inhibited by BCL‐2/BCL‐XL/BCL‐W. Cytochrome c binds to Apaf‐1, which recruits
  Pro‐Caspase‐9, forming the apoptosome. In the apoptosome, Pro‐Caspase‐9 is activated
  by autoproteolytic cleavage, initiating the caspase‐processing cascade. The extrinsic
  pathway is activated by engagement of membrane receptors. These proteins induce
  DISC involving TRADD, FADD, Caspase‐8, and Caspase‐10. Initiator Caspase‐8/10 activation
  is negatively regulated by c‐FLIP. Once active, executioner caspases (Caspase‐3/6/7)
  bring about apoptosis.
