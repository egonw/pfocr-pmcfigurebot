caption: 'MDA-MB-231-derived EVs carried miR-887-3p into BC cells. ECORI Pan-Cer database
  analyzed the expression (a) and prognosis (b) of miR-887-3p in BC. EVs were treated
  with RNase (RNase-group) and RNase+SDS (RNase+SDS-group), respectively. miR-887-3p
  expression was detected using RT-qPCR (c). Next, miR-Inhibitor was transfected into
  MDA-MB-231 cells while Mock miR served as a negative control. Then, EVs (EV-NC group
  and EV-inhi group) were extracted as described in a method. RT-qPCR was performed
  to determine miR-887-3p expression in MDA-MB-231 cells (d) and EVs (e). MCF-7, BT474,
  and HCC1937 cells were treated with EVs in different groups, and then RT-qPCR was
  performed to determine miR-887-3p expression (f). Data were expressed as the mean
  ± standard deviation. In (f), two-way ANOVA and Tukey''s multiple comparison test
  were used to determine statistical significance, whereas in (c)–(e) one-way ANOVA
  and Tukey''s multiple comparison test were used. ∗p < 0.05 and∗∗p < 0.01. Three
  independent experiments were performed. BC: breast cancer; miR: microRNA; RT-qPCR:
  reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction; ANOVA: analysis of
  variance.'
