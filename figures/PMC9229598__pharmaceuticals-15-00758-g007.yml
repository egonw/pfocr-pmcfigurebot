caption: 'U0126 enhances Rh3 action in relation to the EMT process and the ERK pathway
  in A549 and PC9 cells. (A) HIF-1α, ERK, p-ERK, VEGF, and EMT-related protein expression
  in A549 and PC9 cells following treatment with 40 µM Rh3, 10 µM U0126, and 100 µM
  CoCl2. (B) Protein expression is represented by the histograms. * p < 0.05, ** p
  < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 compared with the control group; # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01,
  ### p < 0.001 compared with the CoCl2 group; & p < 0.05, && p < 0.01, &&& p < 0.001
  compared with the Rh3 group; % p < 0.05, %% p < 0.01, %%% p < 0.001 compared with
  the CoCl2 + Rh3 group.'
