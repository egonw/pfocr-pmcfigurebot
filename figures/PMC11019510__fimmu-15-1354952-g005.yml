caption: Schematic diagram showing the mechanism by which TXNDC5 promotes cancer.
  (A) TXNDC5 can be upregulated under hypoxia and play a crucial role in anti-apoptosis
  by regulating hypoxia-induced ROS/ER stress signaling; Hypoxia induce the expression
  of TXNDC5 through HIF-1α in an miR-200b-dependent manner, and strengthen the interaction
  between TXNDC5 and AR to promote proliferation and migration (white arrow). (B)
  Circ_0000517 and circRNA-104718 acted as miR-1296-5p and miR-218-5p competitive
  endogenous RNAs, respectively, upregulating TXNDC5 expression to promote HCC proliferation
  and metastasis (blue arrow). (C) HERG1 leads to ESCC proliferation, migration and
  invasion through TXNDC5 by mediating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (green arrow).
  (D) METTL3 promotes proliferation and metastasis of cervical cancer (CC) cells by
  upregulating TXNDC5 expression via m6A-reader-dependent way (orange arrow). (E)
  Highly expressed TXNDC5 can promote angiogenesis by inhibiting the expression of
  SERPINF1 and TRAF1 (red arrow).
