figure_title: Correcting chr21 dosage upregulates neuro- and angio-related gene sets,
  and downregulates Notch signaling pathway
caption: (A) Hierarchical tree of biological processes with enriched GO terms among
  upregulated genes. Colors cluster by similar terms (pink, angiogenesis; blue, neurogenesis;
  green, cytoskeleton organization and extracellular matrix [ECM]; purple, response
  to stimulus).(B) Largest GO term clusters were relating to neurogenesis, response
  to stimulus, and angiogenesis. Genes enriched in these terms show large overlaps,
  which are depicted in the Venn diagram.(C) Subset of significant GO terms relating
  to neuro- and angio-related terms (XIST+/XIST−; FDR <0.05). Notably, XIST+ cells
  show enhancement of neuro- and angio-related pathways and downregulate negative
  regulation of neural development.(D) Notch genes significantly up- and downregulated
  after silencing the extra chr21 (XIST+/XIST−). Downregulated genes that were significantly
  enriched in the Notch pathway in XIST+ cells are highlighted in the red box (GO:0007219,
  GO:0008593; FDR < 0.05).(E) Heatmap of Z score-normalized gene expression enriched
  in angiogenesis-related gene sets (row, clone; column, gene). Rows were clustered
  by expression. Relevant GO ID and terms are listed below heatmap.
