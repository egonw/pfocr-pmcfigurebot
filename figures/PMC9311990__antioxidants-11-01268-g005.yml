caption: 'The influence of GBE on CAV-1 expression and CAV-1-NOX interaction in 661W
  cells and C57BL/6J mice exposed to WL illumination. (A) Transcriptome sequencing
  was performed on 661W cells pre-treated with or without GBE (100 mg/L, 24 h) exposed
  to WL (4000 lux) for 2 h. Volcano plots of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
  (left panel). Heatmap analysis of significantly changed caveolae-related genes (middle
  panel). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of caveolae-related genes (right panel).
  (B) The 661W cells pre-treated with GBE (100 mg/L 24 h) were exposed to WL (4000
  lux) for 2 h, and the expression of CAV-1 was assessed by Western blot analysis
  (left panel). The relative expression of CAV-1 is shown in the middle panel. Retinal
  tissues from mice with the indicated treatments were co-stained with DAPI (blue
  fluorescence), CAV-1 (red fluorescence) and rhodopsin (green fluorescence) (right
  panel). (C) The influence of GBE on NOX2 expression is shown in the left upper panel;
  the densitometry analysis of protein expression is shown in the right upper panel.
  CAV-1-NOX2 interaction was evaluated by co-immunoprecipitation (bottom-left panel).
  The protein lysate was pulled down by anti-CAV-1 antibody and then the samples were
  detected with anti-NOX2 antibody. The co-localization of CAV-1 (red fluorescence)
  and NOX2 (green fluorescence) was indicated with immunofluorescence staining (right
  panel). ** p < 0.01 vs. Control, ## p < 0.01 vs. WL. WL: white light, INL: inner
  nuclear layer, ONL: outer nuclear layer.'
