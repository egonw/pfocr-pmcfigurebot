caption: 'A schematic summary of CP-induced hepatotoxicity and the hepatoprotective
  role of TA in mice. TA was effective in improving cellular redox status, activating
  Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, mitigating inflammation, and suppressing apoptosis in the liver.
  CP: Cyclophosphamide; TA: Taxifolin; Nrf2: Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor
  2; HO-1: Heme oxygenase 1; ROS: Reactive oxygen species; NF-ÎºB: Nuclear transcription
  factor kappa-B.'
article_title: 'Hepatoprotective effect of taxifolin on cyclophosphamide-induced oxidative
  stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in mice: Involvement of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling.'
