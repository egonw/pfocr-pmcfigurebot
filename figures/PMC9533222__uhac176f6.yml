caption: The ethylene biosynthesis and signaling transduction pathways of G. paniculata.
  Heat maps of the expression of ethylene biosynthesis and signaling transduction
  pathway genes during flower development in wild type and two cultivars (‘YX1’ and
  ‘YX4’). The R, S, and L refer to root, stem, and leaf. The S1, S2, and S3 are flower
  bud stage (S1), semi-open stage (S2), and fully open stage (S3), respectively. b
  and c, Expression of ERS genes in petals of two cut G. paniculata flowers determined
  by qPCR. Flowers were treated with 10 ppm ethylene for 0 h, 4 h, and 12 h. The air
  treatment (0 h) was used as a control. ‘YX1’ and ‘YX4’ were the name of two cultivars
  used in the experiment.
