caption: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotation of the
  differentially expressed genes in sugarcane inoculated with the S. scitamineum isolates
  Ss97009 and SsV89101. Distribution of KEGG pathways in (A) up-regulated and (B)
  down-regulated DEGs. The x-axis represents the number of genes and the y-axis represents
  the KEGG categories.
