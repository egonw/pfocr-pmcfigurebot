caption: Reaction and catalytic mechanism of human aromatase. (a) The three‐step reaction
  catalyzed by aromatase allowing the conversion of androgens into estrogens. (b)
  Catalytic cycle of cytochromes P450 and possible uncoupling pathways. The peroxide
  shunt pathway can generate directly Cpd 0 (9) and Cpd I (6). (c) Active site of
  human aromatase (cyan, PDB ID 3S79) with the predicted proton relay network. The
  helix I is superimposed to the corresponding one in cytochrome P450cam (yellow,
  PDB ID 5CP4) to show the distortion in human aromatase due to the presence of Pro308.
  The heme is shown in red and the substrate androstenedione in green. Dashed black
  lines represent the predicted proton relay network.
