caption: 'The inflammation-related antiangiogenic effects of SANG in TNF-α-stimulated
  TNBC cells. (A) The human angiogenesis microarray blots were used to measure the
  expression of various angiogenic chemokine/cytokine in the cell-free supernatant.
  For each cell line, the four blots correspond to control, SANG-treated, TNF-α-stimulated,
  and co-treated (TNF-α + SANG) cells. (B) The captured images revealed the altered
  expressions in the chemokine CCL2. The human angiogenesis microarray map shows the
  location of the impacted chemokine MCP1/CCL2 as denoted by a red frame. (C) Quantification
  of extracellular CCL2 released by differently treated TNBC cells. The significant
  difference between TNF α-treated cells vs. control cells (*) or between TNF-α-stimulated
  vs. co-treated (#) groups was determined using an unpaired t-test. **** p < 0.0001;
  ***/### p < 0.001; # p < 0.05; NS, not significant.'
