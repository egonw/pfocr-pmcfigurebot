caption: Effects of TRIM22 on ROS production, mitochondrial potential and Warburg
  effect in OS cells. (a) Heatmap of DEGs of HOS cells transfected with shNC and shTRIM22.
  (b) GSEA was used to identify the distribution of genes in the ROS-related, AMPK
  signaling-related, mTOR signaling-related and autophagy-related pathway gene set
  of HOS cells transfected with shNC and shTRIM22. (c, d) Mitochondrial potential
  was assessed and quantified by JC-1 staining in HOS and 143B cells (n = 3, ***P<0.001,
  unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test). Scale bar, 100 μm. (e, f) Detection and quantification
  of ROS levels in HOS and 143B cells by flow cytometry (n = 3, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001,
  unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test). (g, h) Evaluation of GSH/GSSG ratio and GPX
  activity in HOS and 143B cells (n = 3, *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, unpaired two-tailed
  Student's t-test). (i) Western blot analysis of AMPK/mTOR signaling and LC3 as well
  as p62 protein levels in HOS and 143B cells. (j, k) Detection of ECAR and OCR in
  HOS and 143B cells (n = 3, two-way ANOVA with post hoc test). DEGs = differentially
  expressed genes; GSEA = gene set enrichment analysis; ROS = reactive oxygen species;
  GSH = reduced glutathione; GSSG = oxidized glutathione; GPX = glutathione peroxidase;
  ECAR = extracellular acidification rate; OCR = O2 consumption rate.
