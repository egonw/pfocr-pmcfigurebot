caption: KDM1A knockdown suppressed T24 cell proliferation and promoted H3K4 histone
  methylation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and the unfolded protein response. Groups
  of T24 cells were separately transfected with two sh-KDM1A plasmids or a control
  plasmid. A KDM1A expression was detected by qRT-PCR and western blotting, B H3K4
  histone di-methylation levels were detected by ELISA and western blotting, C and
  D CCK-8 assays and Edu staining were used to assess the effect on cell proliferation
  (red indicates a Edu-positive signal and blue indicates nuclei stained with DAPI),
  E The expression of apoptosis-related proteins was detected by western blotting,
  F Apoptosis was detected by Tunel staining (red indicates a Tunel-positive signal
  and blue indicates nuclei stained with DAPI), G The levels of SOD and MDA were detected
  by ELISA; H The expression of UPR pathway-related proteins was detected by western
  blotting. *** P < 0.001, vs. scramble
