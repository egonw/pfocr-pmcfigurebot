caption: Diagrammatic representation of AKT/mTOR pathway. (A) AKT phosphorylates TSC2
  and GTP-loaded RHEB activates mTORC1 (mammalian TOR complex 1). However, TSC1/TSC2-mediated
  hydrolysis of GTP to GDP switched RHEB from a functionally active GTP-bound state
  to an inactive GDP-bound state and inhibited the functions of mTOR. (B) DDIT4 has
  been documented to block the activity of mTORC1 by activation of TSC1/2 complexes.
  (C,D) Baicalein inhibited mTORC1 (RAPTOR) and mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of
  4EBP1 and S6K.
