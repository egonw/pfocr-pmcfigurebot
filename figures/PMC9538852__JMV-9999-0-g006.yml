caption: SW0123 vaccination alters the distribution of macrophages and neutrophils
  in the lungs upon SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. (A) UMAP plot of cell clusters from different
  phenotypes of macrophages identified in lung tissues from rhesus macaques with SW0123
  vaccination or PBS administration. The color of cells reflected the individual origin.
  (B) Quantifying proportion from four macrophage phenotypes among rhesus macaques
  with SW0123 vaccination or PBS administration. (C) The UMAP plot showed the expression
  of CD69 in macrophages. (D) The Violin plot showed CD69 expression level in the
  lung macrophages with SW0123 vaccination or PBS treatment post‐SARS‐CoV‐2 challenge
  in rhesus macaques. (E) Heatmap of DEGs among macrophages in rhesus macaques with
  SW0123 vaccination or PBS administration. (F) KEGG pathway analysis showed the participation
  of DEGs in indicated signaling pathways among lung macrophages from rhesus macaques
  with SW0123 vaccination or PBS administration. (G) UMAP plot of cell clusters from
  different phenotypes of neutrophils identified in lung tissues from rhesus macaques
  with SW0123 vaccination or PBS administration. The color of cells reflected the
  individual origin. (H) Quantifying proportion of three neutrophil phenotypes among
  rhesus macaques with SW0123 vaccination or PBS administration. (I) KEGG pathway
  analysis showed the participation of DEGs in indicated signaling pathways among
  lung neutrophils from rhesus macaques with SW0123 vaccination or PBS administration.
  (J) The Violin plot showed the assessment of PMN‐MDSC characteristics in the three
  phenotypes of neutrophils. DEGs, differentially expressed genes; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia
