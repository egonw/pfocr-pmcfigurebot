caption: 'Folecitin reduced Aβ via inhibiting BACE-1 expression. (a) Immunoblots of
  BACE1 and Aβ in the brain homogenates of the adult mice for the experimental groups
  including (c) LPS, LPS + F, and F alone. Histogram of (b) BACE1 and (c) Aβ. β-Actin
  was used as a house-keeping loading control (reference control). The bands were
  analysed using the Image J software, and the density histograms (expressed in AU)
  compared to the control were organized using GraphPad Prism. Values are presented
  as the mean ± SEM for the indicated proteins (n = 6 mice per group). C: control,
  LPS: lipopolysaccharide, F: folecitin, AU: arbitrary units, #P < 0.05 and ###P <
  0.001 as compared to the C group, and ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗∗P < 0.001 as compared to
  the LPS group.'
