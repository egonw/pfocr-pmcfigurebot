figure_title: The circadian clock is disrupted in human CRC
caption: (A) Representative bright-field microscopy images of organoids established
  from normal and tumor tissue from the same patient. Scale bars, 100 μm. (B) Detrended
  Bmal1-driven luminescence over time for matched normal and tumor PDOs. (C) Circadian
  period from PDOs was calculated in matched normal and tumor intestinal organoids
  using BioDare2. NR, nonrhythmic. (D) Circadian amplitude for each tumor-derived
  PDO normalized to the matched normal PDO from each of seven pairs. Amplitude was
  calculated using BioDare2. Data represent the mean ± SEM, and statistical significance
  was determined using Wilcoxon’s matched-pair signed-rank test. Asterisks represent
  the P value, with ****P < 0.0001. (E) Circadian rhythmicity determined by Bmal1-luciferase
  reporter activity of matched PDO pairs over 72 hours presented as a heatmap. Each
  row represents a normal or tumor PDO line (n = 7 independent PDO pairs). (F) Core
  clock gene expression in normal surrounding tissue (n = 57) versus colorectal tumors
  (n = 470) using TCGA. Data represent the mean ± SEM, and comparisons with a P value
  lower than 0.001 (two-way Student’s t test) are labeled red. (G) Heatmaps showing
  the correlation of gene expression among core clock genes in normal surrounding
  tissue and colorectal tumors. Asterisks represent significant covariance, where
  P < 0.001. (H) Patients with CRC in TCGA were binned into high-covariance (n = 212)
  or low-covariance (n = 202) categories on the basis of variance between core clock
  and Wnt pathway genes and shown relative to overall survival probability. P value
  was estimated using the log-rank method from Kaplan-Meier curves, P = 0.0032.
