figure_title: Metabolic reprogramming in ADA and PDK1 mutant human primary T cells
caption: A-B, Heatmaps of differential metabolite levels in (A) ADA and (B) PDK1 T
  cell mutants. Significant metabolite changes had an adjusted-p < 0.10 and log2 fold-changes
  > 0.50. Heatmap values depict the z-score of log2 fold-changes.C-D, Waterfall plots
  of metabolic pathway analyses (MetPA) in (C) ADA and (D) PDK1 T cell mutants. Bar
  color, size and opacity represent pathway significance and impact scores, which
  summarizing metabolite fold-changes of each pathway. MetPA results are given for
  metabolites-only in the overexpression mutants and for integrated metabolite-gene
  expression in the knockout mutants.E-F, Flow cytometric analyses of functional markers
  in ADA and PDK1 T cell mutants. Histograms and are provided for (E) cytotoxicity
  and (F) exhaustion markers. Metabolomics and flow cytometry data were analyzed with
  n >= 3 for each condition and control.
