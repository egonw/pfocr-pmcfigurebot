figure_title: TRIM24 is selectively expressed in HNSCC cells and negatively regulates
  STAT1
caption: 'a Volcano plot showing top 100 upstream regulators based on Ingenuity pathway
  analysis of RNA sequencing data from oral tumour bearing Stat1+/+ and Stat1−/− mice
  (n = 4 per group). b Predicted mechanistic network analysis showing transcriptional
  targets of TRIM24 based on Ingenuity pathway analysis of RNA sequencing data from
  oral tumour-bearing Stat1+/+ and Stat1−/− mice. Genes in red are upregulated and
  blue are downregulated in the RNA sequencing data set. c Correlation of TRIM24 expression
  levels with STAT1 expression in tumours from HNSCC patients samples acquired from
  The Cancer Genome Atlas. Significance determined by Pearson correlation coefficient.
  d Gene expression of Trim24 determined by RT-qPCR in CAL27 cells treated with scramble
  or Stat1 siRNA for 72 h. e TRIM24 protein expression by CAL27 cells treated with
  scramble or Stat1 siRNA for 72 h, determined by flow cytometry. f Gene expression
  of TRIM24 in tumours of HNSCC tumour-bearing mice orthotopically injected with the
  LY2 cell line. g TRIM24 protein expression, determined by flow cytometry, in HNSCC
  cells of mice orthotopically injected with the LY2 cell line. h, j Gene expression
  of Trim24 and Stat1 determined by RT-qPCR in (H) CAL27 and (J) UMSCC22A cells treated
  with scramble or Trim24 siRNA for 48 or 72 h. i, k Protein expression of TRIM24,
  STAT1, pSTAT1 and GAPDH, determined by western blot, in i CAL27 and k UMSCC22A cells
  accompanied by the protein band intensities relative to GAPDH in scramble and Trim24
  siRNA-treated cells after 48 and 72 h (n = 3 samples per group). Data are presented
  as mean +/− SEM. #p value <0.1, *p value <0.05; **p value <0.01; ***p value <0.001
  between groups.'
