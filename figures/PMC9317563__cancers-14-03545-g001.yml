caption: Plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) development and functions. During development
  and activation of pDC, several networks are successively involved as specification
  program, differentiation program, innate and adaptive response pathways, and regulatory
  pathways. Specification program of pDC start in progenitors through PU.1 expression,
  FLT3 and TCF4 pathway leading to IRF8 activation. Differentiation into pDC depends
  to SPIB expression leading to IRF7, IRF8 and IRF5 activation, IFN-I (IFNα, IFNβ,
  IFNω) and IFN-III (IFNλ) secretion, and expression of several genes involved in
  pDC functions. Innate response develops from pattern recognition receptors (PPRs)
  such as Toll-like receptors (TLR), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), cytosolic DNA sensors
  (CDCs) and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) leading to IFN-I
  secretion, cytokines and chemokines secretion, and proteins expression involved
  in adaptive response. After activation and molecule of histocompatibility complex
  (MHC) class II antigen presentation, pDCs express several immune checkpoint molecules.
  Other regulatory molecules are expressed by pDC after IFN-I and cytokines production.
  Specific markers were reported in Blastic pDC Neoplasm (BPDCN, purple background),
  Mature pDC Proliferation (MPDCP, pink), and solid cancers (salmon red) including
  mutations (star) and overexpression (underline).
