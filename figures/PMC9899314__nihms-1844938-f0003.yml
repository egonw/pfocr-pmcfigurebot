  (250 nM) at various time points and probed for MDM2, p53, p21, and vinculin.B. qRT-PCR
  analysis of MOLM-13 cells treated with MS3227 (250 nM) at various time points and
  assessed for relative RNA-expression of MDM2 and TP53.C. Dose-response curve cell
  viability for MOLM-13 cells treated with MS3227 or AMG 232 for 3 days.D. Western
  blot of MOLM-13 cells treated with MS3227 or AMG 232 at 4 hr and 24 hr and probed
  for PUMA and vinculin.E. Bar graph of MOLM-13 cells with flow cytometry for Annexin+
