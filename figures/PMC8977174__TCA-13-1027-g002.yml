caption: ADAMDEC1 inhibited apoptosis of NSCLC cells. (a) Tunel assay was applied
  to compare the cell apoptosis of CTRL, OE‐NC, OE‐ ADAMDEC1, shCTRL and shADAMDEC1
  groups in HCC827 and NCI‐H1299 cells (scale bar, 100 μm). (b) The ratio of apoptosis
  in the HCC827 and NCI‐H1299 cells transfected with indicated vectors, which consisting
  of the CTRL, OE‐NC, OE‐ ADAMDEC1, shCTRL and shADAMDEC1 groups were detected by
  flow cytometry. Comparison of the ratio of apoptosis in the aforementioned five
  groups. Each bar indicates the mean apoptosis rate ± standard deviation per group.

article_title: Upregulation of ADAMDEC1 correlates with tumor progression and predicts
  poor prognosis in non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) via the PI3K/AKT pathway.
