caption: Serum from ovarian cancer patients shows alterations in several metabolic
  pathways. Metabolic pathway analysis for NMR metabolomics analysis of serum from
  patients with ovarian cancer and with ovarian benign neoplasms. All the matched
  pathways are displayed as circles. The color and size of each circle are based on
  p-value and pathway impact value, respectively. The most impacted pathways having
  statistical significance (p < 0.05) are indicated.
