caption: HTR1A inhibits the TGF‐β/TβRII/Smad canonical pathway. a,b) RNA‐seq of HTR1A
  overexpressing cells were analyzed by KEGG and GSEA, while TGF‐β and EMT pathway
  were enriched. c,d) HTR1A significantly inhibited the expression of TβRII and p‐Smad3
  proteins, while no significant change was shown in the mRNA level. e–g) TGF‐β1 and
  LY2109761 rescued the signaling pathway and migration ability of breast cancer cells
  mediated by HTR1A. h) F‐actin staining of HTR1A overexpressing and knockdown cells.
  i) Cell adhesion analyzes of HTR1A overexpressing and knockdown cells. Data are
  means ± SD, n = 3. *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01.
