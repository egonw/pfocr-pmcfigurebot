caption: EAPB0503 actives p53 signaling pathway and dowregulates its ubiquitin ligase
  HDM2. (A) Western blot analysis showing basal levels of HDM2, p53, P-p53, GAPDH
  and actin in untreated OCI-AML3 and OCI-AML2 cells. (B) Western blot analysis of
  HDM2, p53, P-p53, and actin in EAPB0503 treated OCI-AML3 and OCI-AML2 cells for
  6, 24 and 48 h. Histograms represent the densitometries of HDM2/Actin and P-p53/p53
  ratio of 3 independent experiments. (C) Western blot analysis showing the basal
  expression levels of HDM2, p53 and P-p53 with respect to GAPDH in blasts from NPM1c
  and wt-NPM1 AML patients. Western blot analysis shows the expression levels of HDM2,
  and P-p53 with respect to total histone H3, and p53 with respect to Actin in blasts
  from NPM1c (red) and wt-NPM1 (black) AML patients following ex vivo treatment with
  EAPB0503 for 6 h (D) or (E) 24 h. Histograms represent the average densitometries
  of HDM2/H3 and P-p53/p53 ratio of the three NPM1c and three wt-NPM1 patients represented
  in the Western blots.*, ** and *** indicate p values â‰¤ 0.05; 0.01 and 0.001, respectively.
  p-values less than 0.05 were considered significant.
