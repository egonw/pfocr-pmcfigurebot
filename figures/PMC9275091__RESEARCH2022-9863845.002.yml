caption: Alterations of gut microbiota and metabolic profiles in stool samples after
  different treatments in DSS-induced colitis mice. (a) β-Diversity of the gut microbiota
  by PCoA plots. (b, c) Relative abundance of microbial taxa at the genus level in
  each group. (d) Concentrations of SCFAs were measured (n = 5). (e) Analysis of various
  metabolites in metabolic pathway between NS and RSV+Li01 groups and the difference
  of tryptophan and indoleacetic acid concentration in all groups. Data are presented
  as mean ± SEM, ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001 for the comparison.
