caption: 'Functional verification of candidate glycosyltransferase, malonyltransferase,
  and methyltransferase. (A) Candidate glycosyltransferase, malonyltransferase, and
  methyltransferase were identified by Pearson correlation analysis of metabolites
  and genes. Each candidate gene’s expression represents the fragments per kilobase
  of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM). GT: glycosyltransferase, OMT: O-methyltransferase,
  MAT: malonyltransferase. White (W), blue (B), and purple (P) qingke grains at the
  grain developmental stage (I), grain color changing stage (II), and grain maturation
  stage (III), respectively. (B) LC−MS/MS analyses the activity of six candidate genes.
  The number 1-5 represent five anthocyanin standards: 1: Cya-3,5-O-diglu; 2: Cya
  3-O-rut; 3: Cya 3-O-glu; 4: Cya 3-O-malglu; 5: Cya. (C) The MS/MS spectra (main
  fragments) for predicted product 6 (Peo-O-malglu). (D) Schematic summary of GT,
  MT, and OMT activities in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway. Cya, cyanidin; Cya
  3-O-rut, cyanidin 3-O-rutinoside; Cya 3-O-glu, cyanidin 3-O-glucoside; Peo-O-malglu,
  peonidin O-malonylglucoside.'
