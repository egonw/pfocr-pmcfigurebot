caption: 'Platelets upregulate tumor PD-L1 through EGF/EGFR pathway. (A) Heatmap showing
  mean concentration of indicated cytokines in conditioned medium from MDA-MB-468
  monoculture, platelet, and MDA-MB-468 cell coculture (with platelets); cocultures
  treated with either aspirin or ticagrelor. N = 3 replicates. (B) Fold change in
  PD-L1 cell-surface expression measured by flow cytometry in response to indicated
  concentration of EGF relative to vehicle control for MDA-MB-468 cells. N = 4. (C)
  Fold change in PD-L1 cell-surface expression measured by flow cytometry in response
  to indicated concentrations of recombinant pro-EGF and EGF relative to vehicle control
  for MDA-MB-468 cells. N = 4 to 8. (D) EGFR levels of MCF7, A549, and MDA-MB-468
  cells were measured by flow cytometry. Isotype control (IgG2b, κ) from each cell
  line was used as the negative control. (E) Left: representative western blot images
  of total EGFR and pEGFR (Tyr1068) of MDA-MB-468 cells. Right: graph of western blot
  quantification of pEGFR/total EGFR ratio for all donors (see G for full blots and
  detailed information). N = 8. (F) Flow cytometric analysis of PD-L1 level of MDA-MB-468
  cells cultured alone, cocultured with platelets, or cocultured with platelets and
  3 μg/mL cetuximab. N = 6. (G) Flow cytometric analysis of PD-L1 levels of MDA-MB-468
  cells cultured alone, cocultured with platelets, or cocultured with platelets and
  2 μg/mL EGF-neutralizing antibody. N = 7. (H) Flow cytometric analysis of PD-L1
  levels of MDA-MB-468 cells treated with CRP-induced activated platelet releasate
  with or without 2 μg/mL EGF neutralizing antibody. N = 5. (I) T-cell cytotoxicity
  efficiency in MDA-MB-468 cells cocultured with platelets or in the presence of 3
  μg/mL cetuximab. N = 6 to 8. (J) Spearman’s rank correlation analysis for EGFR and
  PD-L1 (CD274) in The Cancer Genome Atlas breast and lung cancer data sets. Each
  line represents a separate experiment using platelets isolated from a different
  healthy donor. Paired t tests were used for testing data with 2 groups. One-way
  analysis of variance with Tukey correction was used for testing data with 3 or more
  groups. ns, not significant. ∗P < .05, ∗∗P < .01, ∗∗∗∗P < .0001. -, tumor monoculture; +,
