caption: Effect of CFH on the STAT3 signaling pathway in human umbilical vein endothelial
  cells. HUVECs were incubated with CFH-containing conditioned medium or control medium.
  (A) Analysis of protein levels of total STAT3 and p-STAT3 via western blotting.
  GAPDH was used as a loading control. (B) Ratio of p-STAT3 and STAT3 protein levels.
  *P<0.05 vs. Con group, n=5. Con, control; CFH, complement factor H; p-, phosphorylated.
article_title: Complement factor H inhibits endothelial cell migration through suppression
  of STAT3 signaling.
