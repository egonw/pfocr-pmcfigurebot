caption: 'MK2206 2HCl induced LC3 II and p62 expressions in OSCC cells and 4NQO-induced
  mouse tongue tumors. (a) MK2206 2HCl promoted LC3 II expression in CAL27 cells as
  showed by immunofluorescence. Magnification ×400. (b) MK2206 2HCl decreased p62
  expression in CAL27 cells. All data are presented as the mean ± SD. ∗∗P < 0.01 as
  compared with the control group. Magnification ×400. (c) The level of LC3 II was
  increased by western blotting in MK2206 2HCl-treated CAL27 cells. (d) MK2206 2HCl
  promoted LC3 II expression in 4NQO-induced mouse tongue tumors by IHC. All data
  are presented as the mean ± SD. ∗∗P < 0.01 as compared with the blank group, ##P
  < 0.01 as compared with the 4NQO+captisol group. Magnification ×400.'
