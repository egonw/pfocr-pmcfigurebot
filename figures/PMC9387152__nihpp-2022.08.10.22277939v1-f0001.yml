figure_title: Molecular signature of COVID-19 ARDS compared to bacterial sepsis-induced
  ARDS
caption: a. Differentially abundant molecules (150 metabolites, 70 proteins) between
  the two ARDS groups. b. Functional annotations of differentially abundant metabolites
  and proteins at the pathway level. Overall, 33 metabolic and signaling pathways
  with three or more significant molecules were deregulated between the two ARDS groups.
