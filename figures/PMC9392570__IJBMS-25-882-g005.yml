caption: 'AS-IV inhibits the proliferation of KGN cells by activating PPARγ signaling
  and promoting autophagy (A) Viability of KGN cells treated with AS-IV was detected
  by CCK-8. *P<0.5 and ***P<0.001 versus control. &P<0.05 versus the AS-IV 40 μg/ml
  group. (B) Proliferation of KGN cells treated with AS-IV in the absence or presence
  of PPARγ inhibitor GW9662 or autophagy inhibitor 3-MA, detected by CCK-8. ***P<0.001
  versus control. #P<0.05, ##P<0.01, and ###P<0.001 versus the AS-IV 80 μg/ml group.
  (C) Proliferation of KGN cells treated with AS-IV in the absence or presence of
  GW9662 or 3-MA observed through EdU staining. (D) KGN cell colonies following AS-IV
  treatment in the absence or presence of GW9662 or 3-MA. Data are expressed as mean
  ± SD'
