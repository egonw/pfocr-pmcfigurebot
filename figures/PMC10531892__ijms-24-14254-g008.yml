caption: 'Summary of TQ’s significant inhibitory concentrations for distinct durations
  on CALR, inflammasome pathway, and sPD-L1 in HR+ and TNBC. (A) TQ’s significant
  inhibitory concentrations on expression of CALR, NLRP3 complex components and IL-1β
  in PBMCs/TAMs of HR+ and TNBC after 24, 48, and 72 h of treatment. (B) The significant
  inhibitory concentrations of TQ after 24, 48, and 72 h of treatment on IL-1β and
  sPD-L1 secretion from TAMs/PBMCs of HR+ and TNBC, respectively. The expression and
  protein levels were compared to those of the DMSO control. All experiments were
  performed in triplicate. TQ: thymoquinone; CALR: calreticulin; NLRP3: NOD-like receptor
  (NLR) family pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3); PYCARD: PYD and CARD domain
  containing; PBMCs: peripheral blood mononuclear cells; TAMs: tumor-associated macrophages;
  HR+: hormone receptor-positive; TNBC: triple-negative breast cancer; BC: breast
  cancer; DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide; IL-1β: interleukin-1 beta; sPD-L1: soluble programmed
  death ligand 1.'
