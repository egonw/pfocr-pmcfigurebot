caption: 'ZYD regulated the serum amino acid metabolome. (a) Principal component analysis
  (PCA) of the amino acid metabolites among the three groups. (b) The partial least
  squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) compared the metabolic profile across groups.
  (c) Permutation test of this PLS-DA model. (d) The heatmap and hierarchical clustering
  analysis (HCA) detailed the variation of the three groups'' 53 differential metabolites
  (Kruskal-Wallis test, P < 0.05). The correlation of samples was decided by Euclidean
  distance. (e) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the 53 differential metabolites.
  C: Healthy control group with the sham operation, MG: severe acute pancreatitis
  model group, and ZYD: Zengye decoction treatment group. n = 7 (per group).'
