caption: LPCAT3-related genes enrichment analysis in LAML. (A,B) Protein-protein interaction
  network of different expressed LPCAT3 using the STRING tool and GeneMania. (C-G)
  The top 100 LPCAT3 related genes were obtained from the GEPIA2 website, and the
  correlation with the top 5 genes was analyzed, including BRAP, HK1, TLN1, TPD52L2,
  and PNPO. (H) The plot for the molecular function data in GO analysis is also shown.
  (I) KEGG pathway analysis was performed based on the LPCAT3-binding and interacted
  genes. (J-L) According to Reactome analysis of KEGG and AML, the GSEA map shows
  signaling pathways associated with LPCAT3 expression. LPCAT3, lysophosphatidylcholine
  acyltransferase 3; TPM, transcript per million; LAML, acute myeloid leukemia; GO,
  Gene Ontology; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; GSEA, gene set enrichment
  analysis; NES, normalized enrichment score.
