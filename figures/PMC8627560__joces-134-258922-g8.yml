caption: Aberrant USP7 binding and ubiquitylation of Shoc2-bound HUWE1 in cells expressing
  Shoc2 NSLAH variants. (A) The USP7 binding of the Shoc2 NSLAH variants. HeLa Shoc2
  CRISPR knockout cells expressing the Shoc2 variants were serum starved for 16 h
  and then stimulated with EGF (0.2 ng/ml) for 7 min. Shoc2 was precipitated using
  anti-Shoc2 antibodies. Immunoblots (IB) were analyzed with anti-Shoc2, -USP7 and
  -HUWE1 antibodies. The results in each panel are representative of three independent
  experiments. (B) HeLa Shoc2 CRISPR knockout cells expressing wild-type (WT) Shoc2-tRFP
  or the Shoc2 S2G or L473I mutants were serum starved for 16 h and then stimulated
  with EGF (0.2 ng/ml) for 7 and 15 min. Shoc2 complexes were precipitated under non-denaturing
  conditions (top left panel) using anti-Shoc2 antibody. Half of the of Shoc2 immunoprecipitates
  (IP) were analyzed with anti-HUWE1 and -RFP antibody. The rest of the Shoc2 immunoprecipitates
  were then denatured and subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-HUWE1 antibody
  (bottom left panel). Ubiquitylation was detected with anti-ubiquitin (Ub) antibody.
  Immunoblots were analyzed with anti-RFP, -Ub and -HUWE1 antibodies. Cell lysates
  were probed with anti-HUWE1, -RFP and -GAPDH antibodies. The results in each panel
  are representative of at least four independent experiments. (C) Bar graph showing
  the relative mean amount of Ub normalized to the total amount of HUWE1 and compared
  to control Ub at 0 min in arbitrary units±s.e. (n=6). (D) Schematic showing the
  working model depicting what is currently understood for the mechanisms by which
  USP7 modulates the Shoc2-mediated ERK1/2 signals. Activation of the ERK1/2 pathway
  is followed by recruitment of USP7 to the Shoc2-HUWE1 complex. In the Shoc2 complex,
  USP7 exerts it activity toward HUWE1 and potentiates ubiquitylation of Shoc2 and
  RAF-1, leading to the adjustments in the amplitude of ERK1/2 signaling. Disruption
  in the molecular mechanisms regulating the amplitude of ERK1/2 signals results in
  abnormal embryonic development.
