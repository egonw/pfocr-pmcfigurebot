caption: Stellettin B-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human OSCC cells.
  (A) Analysis of cell cycle distribution of OC2 cells treated with stellettin B was
  assisted with propidium iodide (PI) staining-based flow cytometry. The cells were
  exposed to 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 µM stellettin B for 24 h. The peaks in the
  flowcharts indicate the cell cycle phases of sub-G1, G1, S, and G2/M. (B) Histograms
  displaying the proportion of each phase of the cell cycle under the indicated stellettin
  B concentration in OC2 cells. (C) OC2 and SCC4 cells were exposed to 0, 5, 10, and
  20 µM stellettin B for 48 h and then stained with TUNEL dye (emitting green fluorescence)
  and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (showing blue fluorescence). The cells were
  placed under a fluorescence microscope for observation. Scale bar = 100 μm. (D)
  Quantified levels of TUNEL positive cells. (E) Western blot analysis of the expression
  of the apoptosis-related protein, cleaved caspase 3, PARP, and cleaved PARP, in
  OC2 and SCC4 cells treated with 0, 5, 10, and 20 µM stellettin B for 48 h. (F) Quantified
  levels of cleaved caspase 3, PARP, and cleaved PARP by comparing with β-actin. Original,
  uncropped images of the Western blots are displayed in . β-actin was blotted as
  an internal control, and error bars stand for the mean ± SE. The data are shown
  for a minimum of three independent trials in triplicate analyzed using Student’s
  t-test to determine significance; * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 relative to the control
  (untreated cells).
