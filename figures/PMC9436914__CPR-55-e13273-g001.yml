caption: 'Expression of DNASE1L3 in hepatocellular carcinoma and its prognostic significance.
  (A and B) The The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database
  showed that the transcription level of DNASE1L3 was lower in hepatocellular carcinoma
  (HCC) compared to paracarcinoma tissues, and high expression of DNASE1L3 has a good
  overall survival (OS) and progression‐free survival (PFS). (C) The transcription
  level of DNASE1L3 was detected by RT‐qPCR in 28 pairs of HCC tissues and adjacent
  non‐tumour tissues. The results showed that 25 (89%) of them were significantly
  down‐regulated. (D) The expression level of DNASE1L3 protein was detected by Western
  blot in 12 pairs of HCC tissues and adjacent non‐tumour tissues. (E) The expression
  level of DNASE1L3 in tissue microarray chip was measured by IHC. The expression
  level of DNASE1L3 in cancer and paracancerous tissues were compared according to
  the histochemical score of AI intelligence score. Scale bar: 100 μm. (F) Kaplan–Meier
  analysis showed that patients with high expression of DNASE1L3 had better OS and
  DFS. (G) Univariate and multivariate analyses of different clinicopathological features
  in HCC patients.'
