caption: Mechanism of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. When the Wnt signal is inactivated,
  the destruction complex ubiquitinates β-catenin to degrade it, and then it is digested
  in the proteasome. When the Wnt signal is activated, the Wnt protein interacts with
  Frizzled receptors and lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/6). Axis inhibition
  protein (Axin) binds to the tail of LRP5/6, and then Disheveled (Dsh) restores the
  activity of β-catenin by phosphorylating and inhibiting the activity of glycogen
  synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) so that β-catenin accumulates and enters the nucleus with
  lymphoid enhancer factor/T-cell factor (LEF/TCF) transcription factors to regulate
  target gene transcription. β-TrCP/SKP β-transducin repeat-containing protein/s-phase
  kinase-associated protein
