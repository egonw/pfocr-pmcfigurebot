caption: Normalized gene counts of selected genes associated with hydrogenase activity
  in G. sulfurreducens at an EAN of −0.15 V compared to +0.15 V. No NH4+ was added
  in both conditions. Genes shown in bold are classified as differentially expressed
  (|log2FC| > 2.00 and P < 0.05; red shows upregulated genes; blue shows downregulated
  genes). Gene counts are expressed in RPKM.
