caption: 'TIPE2 reduces autophagy and OGD-induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells by activating
  the mTORC1 signaling pathway. (A) Western blotting was used to analyze the protein
  expression levels of TIPE2, Raptor, p-mTOR/mTOR and p-4EBP1/4EBP1 in H9c2 cells
  following different treatments. (B) Semi-quantification of the expression levels
  presented in part (A). (C) Expression levels of autophagy-related proteins, LC3B
  and ATG14, in H9c2 cells following different treatments. (D) TUNEL staining was
  used to detect OGD-induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells. Data are representative of three
  independent repeats per experiment. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 vs. plasmid; #P<0.05
  and ###P<0.001 vs. over-TIPE2; &P<0.05 vs over-TIPE2 + ODG. TIPE2, TNF-α-induced
  protein 8-like protein 2; OGD, oxygen glucose deprivation; over-, overexpression;
  ATG14, autophagy related 14; p-, phosphorylated; Raptor, regulatory associated protein
  of mTOR complex 1; 4EBP1, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E.'
