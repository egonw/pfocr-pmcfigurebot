caption: Carbohydrate metabolism and mediators of metabolic reprogramming. Cancer
  cells must acquire a greater amount of nutrients, especially glucose. One of the
  mediators is HIF-1, which increases glucose uptake through the induction of GLUT-1,
  GLUT-4 and GLUT-1; simultaneosly, it can also be stimulated by TGF-Î² through the
  PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Other important mediators are p53 that plays a protective
  role against ROS. GLUT, glucose transporters; Glu-6-P, glucose 6-phosphate; Fru-6-P,
  fructose 6-bisphosphate; Fru-1,6-P, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; Fru-2,6-P, fructose
  2,6-bisphosphate; GA-3-P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate;
  HK, hexokinase; TGFB, transforming growth factor beta; PFK1, phosphofructokinase
  1; PKM2, pyruvate kinase M2; LDHA, lactate dehydrogenase A; G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; 6-PGL, 6-phosphogluconolactonase; NADP+, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate; NADPH, reduced form of NADP; GSSG, glutathione disulfide; GSH, glutathione;
  H2O2, hydrogen peroxide; TIGAR, Tp53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator;
  FGF, fibroblast growth factor; HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor 1; PPP, pentose phosphate
  pathway; KRAS, Kirsten-ras; RPIA, ribose-5 phosphate isomerase; MYC, proto-oncogene;
  Ribulose-5-P, ribulose 5-phosphate; Ribose-5-P, ribose 5-phosphate; SGLT1/2, sodium-glucose
  cotransporter-1/2.
