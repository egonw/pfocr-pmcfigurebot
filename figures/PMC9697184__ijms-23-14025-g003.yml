caption: 'Effect of tandospirone treatment on glutamate concentration in the cortex
  (A), midbrain (B), hippocampus (C), cerebellum (D) and brainstem (E). Mecp2-KO mice
  showed a significantly decreased glutamate concentration in the cortex, hippocampus,
  cerebellum and brainstem when compared with WT mice. Administration of tandospirone
  significantly increased the lower glutamate concentration in the cerebellum and
  brainstem but no significant changes in the cortex, midbrain or hippocampus were
  observed. All values are expressed as the means ± SEMs. Statistical analysis was
  performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s multiple comparison
  post hoc test for intergroup comparisons. n = 6, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, **** p
  < 0.0001, ns: not significant.'
