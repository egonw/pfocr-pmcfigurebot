caption: 'The ERK1/2/CREB/BCL2 signaling pathway mediated the protective effects of
  artemisinin in an ischemia reperfusion mouse model. (A) Western blot analysis of
  P-ERK, P-CREB, BAX and BCL2 protein levels 24 hours after MCAO treatment with different
  doses of artemisinin (2, 6, 18 mg/kg) and normalized with GAPDH. (B) Quantification
  of the P-ERK protein expression levels. (C) Quantification of the P-CREB protein
  expression levels. (D) Quantification of the BAX/BCL2 protein expression ratio.
  (E-G) Western blot analysis and quantification of P-ERK and P-CREB protein levels
  24 hours after MCAO treatment with 1 mg/kg PD98059 followed by 6 mg/kg artemisinin
  and normalized with actin. (H) The brain infarct volume was measured 24 hours after
  MCAO treatment with 1 mg/kg PD98059 followed by 6 mg/kg artemisinin. Representative
  images of the TTC staining. (I) Quantification of the infarction volume of H. (J)
  Evaluation of the neurological deficits using Zea-Longa Scale neurological score
  of each group. (K) Behavioral evaluation of the grasping strength of the forelimb.
  (L) Behavioral evaluation of the pole-jump test. *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001, versus
  ctrl group; ## p < 0.01, ### p < 0.001, versus model group; & p < 0.05, &&& p <
  0.001 versus ART + model group were considered significantly different. The assay
  was repeated at least 3 times.'
