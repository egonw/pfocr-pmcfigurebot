caption: 'Siglec-15 silencing inhibits the activation of STAT1/STAT3 signaling pathway.
  Western blot analysis of STAT1 expression, STAT3 expression, cleaved caspase-3 expression,
  VEGF expression in ARO cells (a), FRO cells (b), and WRO cells (c) in THCA cell
  treatment with agonistic anti-CD40 mAb or Siglec-15 RNAi. (d) Western blot analysis
  of STAT1 expression and STAT3 expression in ARO cell transfection with vector-expressing
  STAT1 or STAT3. Clone formation analysis and flow cytometry analysis of cell proliferation
  (e) and cell apoptosis (f) in ARO cell transfection with vector-expressing STAT1
  and STAT3 and Siglec-15 RNAi. (g) Western blot analysis of cleaved caspase-3 expression
  and VEGF expression in ARO cell transfection with vector-expressing STAT1 and STAT3
  and Siglec-15 RNAi. ∗∗p < 0.01, ##p < 0.01, and ^^p < 0.01 indicated statistical
  significance compared with control group, scramble group, or STAT3 group.'
