caption: Regulation of the Hsp90 chaperone cycle by co-chaperones. Progression of
  client proteins through the Hsp90-mediated chaperone folding pathway is regulated
  by co-chaperones, which act at defined stages in the cycle. Co-chaperones may regulate
  Hsp90 association with clients, ATPase activity, conformational changes, and post-translational
  modifications. When inactive, Hsp90 is constitutively dimerized at the C-terminus
  but not the N-terminus. Entry of client proteins is facilitated by co-chaperones
  including the Hsp70/Hsp90 organizing protein Hop, which regulates transfer of clients
  from Hsp70 by binding simultaneously to Hsp70 and Hsp90, to form the intermediate
  complexes. Hop is conserved in Plasmodium falciparum (PfHop, PF3D7_1434300). Kinase
  clients require the kinase-specific co-chaperone Cdc37; however, a Cdc37-encoding
  gene has not been identified in the P. falciparum genome. On ATP binding, Hsp90
  undergoes N-terminal dimerization, and the client protein associates with the middle
  domain of Hsp90. Bindings of other co-chaperones, including peptidyl-prolyl cisâ€“trans
  isomerases (PPIase) and protein phosphatase 5 (PP5), associate to form the asymmetric
  Hsp90 complexes. The P. falciparum genome encodes a PP5 isoform (PfPP5, PF3D7_1355500)
  and multiple PPIase isoforms (PfFKBP35, PF3D7_1247400; PfCns1, PF3D7_1108900; and
  PfCyp40, PF3D7_1111800). These co-chaperones regulate the post-translational modification
  and maturation of Hsp90 complexes. Early co-chaperones subsequently dissociate from
  the complex to be replaced by p23, which stabilizes the late closed Hsp90 complex
  and the client within the complex, and inhibits ATPase activity. Two homologs of
  p23 are encoded in the P. falciparum genome (Pfp23A, PF3D7_1453700; and Pf23B, PF3D7_0927000).
  ATP hydrolysis is stimulated by binding of Aha1, resulting in release of the client
  protein and a return of Hsp90 to the inactive conformation. The P. falciparum genome
  encodes a single Aha1 isoform (PfAha1, PF3D7_0306200). Image created with BioRender.com.
