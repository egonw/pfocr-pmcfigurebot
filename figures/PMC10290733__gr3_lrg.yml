caption: Heatmap with DE proteins and pathways associated with severity (A) Heatmap
  visualizing proteins associated with severity. We selected all proteins that were
  found to be significantly associated with severity after multiple testing corrections.
  (log2FC > ± 0.4 and adjusted p-value <0.05). Rows represent proteins, whereas the
  columns represent individuals. Proteins and individuals are both ordered by hierarchical
  clustering. Top-annotation shows the WHO score for each individual. (B) Heatmap
  shows the comparison of selected terms in individual samples between Cluster 1 and
  Cluster 3. The y-axis represents the enriched pathway term, whereas the x-axis represents
  individual samples. The color indicates the aggregated z-score of each enriched
  term per sample, red indicates an overall increased expression (activated) of the
  corresponding enriched term, whereas the blue color indicates decreased expression
  (repressed).
