caption: Schematic timeline of the experimental procedure. The mice were acclimatized
  to the laboratory environment for 7 days before the studies. The EX-527 or corresponding
  vehicle was injected daily for 3 days before surgery; the MSCs-Exo, or Fer-1, or
  corresponding vehicle was administered 1 hour before surgery. Next, the behavioral
  tests were performed began at the 24 hours after the surgery to verify the success
  of model and the influence of MSCs-Exo on cognitive function in dNCR aged mice.
  In the end, the mice were decapitated after the behavioral tests, and the brain
  tissues were collected for subsequent experiments.
