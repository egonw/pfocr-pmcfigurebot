caption: Different analyses for the identification of VabHLH137 as putatively involved
  in PA biosynthesis in Vitis amurensis cv. Zuoshan-1. A The flavonoid pathway modulation
  in the grapevine berries at three different stages upon Colletotrichum gloeosporioides
  infection. The fold change (log2) levels of the DEGs at the S1, S2, and S3 stages.
  B A heatmap showing the expression profiles of the TFs in response to C. gloeosporioides.
  The fold change (log2) levels of the DEGs at the S1, S2, and S3 stages. The asterisk
  represents VabHLH137, the circle represents VaMYBPAR, and the diamond represents
  VaMYBPA1. C The qRT-PCR analysis of the VabHLH137 and PA biosynthesis-related genes
  in V. amurensis in response to C. gloeosporioides. VvACTIN and VvGAPDH genes were
  used for data normalization. D The PA accumulation in V. amurensis after C. gloeosporioides
  inoculation. Error bars represent the mean ± SD of three independent replicates.
  The statistical significance was determined using Student’s t-test (**P < 0.01;
  ***P < 0.001).
