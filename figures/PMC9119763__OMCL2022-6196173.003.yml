caption: 'Administration of Fn1 inhibitor attenuated I/R-induced cardiac infarction
  and apoptosis. (a) Representative images of TTC and Evens blue staining of myocardial
  sections after I/RI (top). TUNEL (red), α-actinin (green), and DAPI (blue) staining
  of the myocardial sections (middle). (b) Ratios of area at risk (AAR)/left ventricular
  (LV) area and infarct size/area at risk (AAR), and quantification of the TUNEL-positive
  nuclei (bottom, n = 5 per group). Scale bar: 5 mm or 20 μm. (c) Immunoblotting analysis
  of the protein levels of Bcl2, Bax, and cleaved caspase-3 proteins (left) and quantification
  of the relative protein levels (right, n = 4 per group). Data are expressed as mean
  ± SEM. ∗∗∗P < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001 versus the sham-operated group; ##P < 0.01;
  ###P < 0.001, ####P < 0.0001 versus saline I/R 24 h; &&P < 0.01; &&&P < 0.001, &&&&P
  < 0.0001 versus saline I/R 72 h.'
