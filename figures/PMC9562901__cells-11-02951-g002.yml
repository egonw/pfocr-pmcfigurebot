caption: The global metabolomic profiles of the normal and regenerated cartilages.
  (A) The supervised orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA)
  model reveals the metabolic differences between the NOR and REG groups. (B) The
  volcano plot indicates the upregulated differential metabolites (DEMs) in the REG
  group (red), the downregulated DEMs (blue), and non-significantly altered metabolites
  (gray). (C) Venn diagram shows the DEMs matched with the records in the Regeneration
  Roadmap and Aging Atlas databases. (D,E) The different expression levels of docosapentaenoic
  acid 22n-3 (DPA, (D)) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA, (E)) between the NOR and REG
  groups are revealed. (F) The bubble diagram shows the top 20 differential metabolic
  pathways enriched by the DEMs. X-axis represents rich factors, and Y-axis represents
  pathway terms. The numbers of the involved metabolites and p-value are listed on
  the right side. The detailed information is presented in .
