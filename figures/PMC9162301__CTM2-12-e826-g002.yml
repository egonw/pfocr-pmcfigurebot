caption: CD147 regulated the spiral artery remodelling functions of extravillous trophoblast
  (EVCT) through CD147‐integrin β1 membrane complexes and Wnt/β‐catenin signalling.
  (A) Transwell invasion assay of control or CD147 siRNA‐suppressed JEG‐3 cells (3 × 105)
  (N = 5), primary EVCTs (3 × 106) treated with isotype control, CD147 functional
  blocking Ab (N = 4) and primary EVCTs (1 × 106) treated with CD147 stimulatory ligation
  Ab (N = 4). (B) MMP2 mRNA expression (N = 15) and activity (N = 5) of control and
  CD147‐suppressed JEG‐3 cells. (C) Green fluorescence‐labelled endothelial cells
  (HUVECs) were cocultured with red fluorescence‐labelled control or CD147‐suppressed
  JEG‐3 cells. EVCT integration into the endothelial tubing was then quantified by
  confocal microscopy (N = 5). (D) Tube formation assay and (E) permeability assay
  of HUVECs treated with recombinant CD147 (N = 5). (F) Membrane protein complexes
  were resolved by blue native gel electrophoresis (N = 3). Western blot analysis
  of the blue gel identified CD147 in two complexes corresponding to 280 and 480 kDa,
  and both complexes were downregulated after siRNA suppression (N = 5). Protein identification
  of the CD147 membrane complex by liquid chromatography‐tandem mass spectrometry.
  Protein interactions were analysed using the STRING and Reactome pathway databases.
  Minimum required interaction score confidence = 0.95. (G) Protein interaction between
  CD147 and integrin β1 in the immunoprecipitation experiment (N = 5). (H) Integrin
  β1 suppression abolished the stimulatory effect of CD147 ligation Ab in JEG‐3 cell
  invasion (N = 5). (I) CD147 regulated EVCT invasiveness via Wnt/β‐catenin signaling.
  Total β‐catenin, active β‐catenin, p‐GSK3β (Ser9), Axin2, CD147 and β‐actin protein
  expression in control or CD147 siRNA‐suppressed JEG‐3 cells was determined by western
  blotting (N = 10). (J) β‐catenin and active β‐catenin expression in control or integrin
  β1‐suppressed JEG‐3 cells was determined by western blotting (N = 10). (K) Invasion
  of control or CD147 siRNA‐suppressed JEG‐3 cells after cotreatment with Wnt3A (N = 5)
  and invasion of JEG‐3 cells (N = 5) and primary EVCTs (N = 4) treated with CD147
  stimulatory ligation ab and Wnt inhibitor DKK‐1. Scale bar = 100 μm. All the data
  are expressed as the mean ± SD. * P < .05
