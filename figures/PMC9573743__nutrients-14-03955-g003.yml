caption: 'TMAO enhanced osteoclast gene expression and the NF-κB signaling pathway.
  (A) TMAO enhanced osteoclast gene expression (n = 3 per group) as examined by real-time
  PCR. (B,C) TMAO enhanced c-Fos and NFATc1 protein expression as evaluated by Western
  blot (n = 3 per group). (D,E) The protein expression levels of p-IKK, IKK, p-IκBα,
  IκBα, p-p65, and p65 were examined by Western blot after TMAO treatment. TMAO increased
  RANKL-stimulated phosphorylation of IKK, IκBα, and p65 (n = 3 per group). * p <
  0.05, #p < 0.01.'
