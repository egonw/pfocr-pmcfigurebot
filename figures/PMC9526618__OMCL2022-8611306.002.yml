caption: ITGA5 expression in the tissues of gastric cancer patients correlated with
  prognosis. (a). Immunofluorescence images of ITGA5 expression in tumor tissues and
  their paracancerous tissues showing its high expression in the tumor, mostly in
  the cell membrane. (b). Immunohistochemical images of ITGA5 protein expression in
  40 gastric cancer tissues and 40 paracancerous normal tissues showing its high expression
  in the tumor, mostly in the cell membrane. (câ€“e) The results were analyzed by GEPIA
  platform software, Kaplan-Meier plotter public data platform, and starbase platform
  Sun Yat-sen University network public database. All the three databases showed that
  ITGA5 gene expression was correlated with prognostic factors of gastric cancer patients;
  patients with high ITGA5 expression had a poor prognosis; and patients with low
  ITGA5 expression had a better prognosis. ITGA5 is highly expressed in gastric cancer.
  Its high expression level is negatively correlated with the prognosis of gastric
  cancer patients.
