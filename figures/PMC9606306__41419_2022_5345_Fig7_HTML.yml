figure_title: Negative relationship between MUC1 and ATAD3A in breast cancer patients
caption: 'A Representative images of IHC analysis for MUC1 and ATAD3A in 110 breast
  cancer specimens. Bars: 100 μm. B A total of 110 patient samples were divided into
  four groups, as indicated in the table. C The correlation between MUC1 and ATAD3A
  expression in breast cancer specimens was plotted by Pearson correlation analysis.
  (D) Overall survival study of patients with high and low MUC1 expression was analyzed
  in breast cancer patients from TCGA datasets (n = 76). E Overall survival study
  of patients with high and low Pink1 expression was analyzed in breast cancer patients
  from TCGA datasets (n = 1070). F Overall survival study of MUC1 low-ATAD3A high
  and MUC1 high-ATAD3A low breast cancer patients was analyzed from TCGA datasets
  (n = 491). G Schematic overview of the work model. CCCP-induced mitochondrial impairment
  stimulates the translocation of MUC1 to mitochondria. In mitochondria, MUC1 binds
  to ATAD3A and promotes ATAD3A degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway,
  thereby protecting Pink1 from ATAD3A-mediated cleavage. Accumulation of Pink1 leads
  to increased pSer65-Ub and subsequently induces mitophagy to promote malignant properties
  of breast cancer. Targeting both MUC1 and mitophagy based on the combination of
  GO203 and Mdivi-1 essentially suppresses tumor growth.'
