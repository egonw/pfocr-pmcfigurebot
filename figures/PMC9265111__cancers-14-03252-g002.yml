caption: 'SMAD4R361H influences sensitivity to MEK inhibition. (A) Generation of CRISPR-engineered
  PDOs: transfected R4wt (SMAD4wt) PDOs were sorted and sequenced as a bulk population.
  (B) Representative images of three single clones (clones A, B, and C) that were
  expanded for further analysis. (C) DNA-panel-sequencing confirmed homozygote SMAD4R361H
  mutation in each CRISPR-SMAD4R361H clone (clones A, B, and C). (D) Doubling times
  of R4wt, R1R361H, and CRISPR-SMAD4R361H PDOs (clones A, B, and C). The cell density
  was measured on day 2, 3, 5, and 7 by measuring cellular ATP content using Cell
  Titer Glo® assay. Results from four independent experiments were combined (one-way
  ANOVA * p < 0.05). (E) IC50 values of R4wt and R1R361H and CRISPR-SMAD4R361H PDOs
  (clones A, B, and C each in biological triplicates) treated daily for 4 days with
  small molecules targeting the MAPK signaling pathway. Achievable maximal plasma
  concentrations (cmax) are indicated for each drug with dotted lines. In all panels:
  ns = not significant; * p < 0.05, values as mean ± SEM using one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s
  test for multiple comparisons. (Scale bars = 100 µm (A and B)). (See also ).'
