caption: Efficiency of SlInR gene knockdown and effect of SlInR knockdown on gene
  expression of insulin signaling pathway. (A) Efficiency of SlInR gene knockdown
  at 12, 24, 36 and 48 h. (B) The expression of insulin signaling pathway genes was
  detected 24 h after dsSlInR injection by qRT-PCR. Results are represented as means
  ± SD of three independent samples and samples are normalized to SlRPL10 expression
  levels (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01, Student’s t-test).
