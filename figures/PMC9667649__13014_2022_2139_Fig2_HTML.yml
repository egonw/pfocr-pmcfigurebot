caption: 'RNA transcriptome analysis of HMECs. (a) Left: K-means clustering heatmaps
  showing gene expression in siRNA-treated HMECs at 24 h post-irradiation. Right:
  Pathway enrichment analysis of scr- and sip63-treated groups in each cluster based
  on the Gene Ontology (GO) biological process database. Clusters A and B contain
  295 and 205 genes, where upregulated and downregulated genes are depicted in red
  and blue, respectively. (b) Biclustering analysis based on the BCCC method for siRNA-treated
  HMECs at 24 h post-irradiation'
