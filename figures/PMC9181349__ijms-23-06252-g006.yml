caption: HMGB1 plays a vital role in Cd-induced hepatocyte damage. (A) Correlation
  analysis between factors related to hepatocyte damage. The color gradient indicates
  the correlation coefficient, and red is positive correlation, blue is negative correlation.
  (B) Ordination diagram of the principal component analysis (PCA) of HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB
  signaling pathway related factors in hepatocytes induced by Cd or/and Se. The X,
  Y and Z coordinate axis are three principal components (PC1, PC2 and PC3), respectively,
  and the percentages in brackets are the percentage of explained variance. “*” indicates
  a significant correlation (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001).
