figure_title: Inhibition of BAG3-HSP70 alters expression of proteins involved in BAG3-dependent
  autophagy pathway
caption: A-B, Representative western blots for BAG3, HSPB8, SYNPO2, HSP70, HSPB5 in
  NRVMs treated with DMSO or JG-98. C-G, Quantification of BAG3 (C), HSP70 (D), HSPB8
  (E), HSPB5 (F), and SYNPO2 (G) protein expression normalized to total protein loading
  control. H-L, qPCR analysis of bag3 (H), hspa1a (I), hspb8 (J), hspb5 (K), and synpo2
  (L) mRNA expression normalized to β-actin. All treatments were with 1 μM JG-98 for
  18 hours. For all, n = 9 per group from 3 separate experiments; data were analyzed
  by two-tailed t-test and are presented as the mean ± SEM.
