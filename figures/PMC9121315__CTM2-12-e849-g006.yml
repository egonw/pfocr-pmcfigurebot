caption: PANX1 positively regulates IL‐33 synthesis in hepatocytes after LPS administration.
  (A and B) Proportions of IL‐33+ primary mouse hepatocytes at 12 h after lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) stimulation (1 μg/ml) (n = 5 per group). (C) Immunoblot and quantification
  of IL‐33 in primary WT hepatocytes and Panx1−/− hepatocytes from mice at 12 and
  24 h after LPS stimulation (1 μg/ml) (n = 4 per group). (D‐N) Immunoblots and quantification
  of the levels of IL‐33 and intermediates in the PANX1‐P2Xs‐NLRP3‐caspase‐1‐IL‐1
  pathway in L02 cells treated with 10Panx (200 μM), scrambled 10Panx (200 μM), probenecid
  (50 μM) or vehicle at 0, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h after LPS stimulation (1 μg/ml) (n = 4
  per group). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 by Student's t‐test or ANOVA. Correlations were
  analyzed using Pearson's correlation test
