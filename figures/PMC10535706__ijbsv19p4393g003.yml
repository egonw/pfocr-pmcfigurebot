caption: AhR deficiency inhibits the development of CRC. (A) Schematic diagram showing
  the experimental design in the mouse xenograft model. (B) The function of AhR deficiency
  on the growth of DLD-1 cell xenografts in the nude mice was examined. (C) Luciferase
  imaging of the mice with DLD-1 or DLD-1/AhR -/- xenografts at 28 days after tumor
  cell implantation. The quantification of luciferase intensities in tumors in two
  groups. (D) Generation of AhR fl/fl IECs and mice. Restriction sites and expected
  restriction fragment lengths are indicated. (E) Breeding strategy to determine tumor-initiating
  potential of AhR+ cells. (F) Survival analysis of AhR -/- Cre mice and WT mice (n=16/group).
  (G) Western blotting for AhR protein with IEC lysates isolated from fl/fl and WT
  mice. Data from triplicate experiments are presented as mean ± SD. **P < 0.01. (H)
  Immunofluorescence micrographs of AhR (green) and DAPI (blue) expression in the
  colons of WT and AhR -/- Cre mice. Scale bars, 100 μM. (I) Experimental protocol
  used for the induction of the CAC in the AhR -/- Cre mouse model. (J-M) Effects
  of AhR deficiency on CRC development evaluated with microscopic images (J), body
  weight (K), number of intestinal polyp colon length (L), and colon length (M) in
  WT and AhR -/- Cre mice. Data of eight mice per experimental group are shown as
  means ± SD, with Welch's correction through one-tailed t-test. **P < 0.01.
