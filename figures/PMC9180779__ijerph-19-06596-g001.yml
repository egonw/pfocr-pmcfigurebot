caption: Model of the mechanisms explaining the development of emotional disorders
  versus adaptive emotional responses (adapted from []). COVID-19 social distancing
  triggers emotional reactions universally. The top pathway indicates that people
  who have a more neurotic temperament, and who may have developed a sensitivity to
  social-distancing-related triggers due to idiosyncratic learning experiences, engage
  in avoidant coping (e.g., rumination, worry, experiential avoidance), leading to
  the development and maintenance of emotional disorders. The bottom pathway describes
  an adaptive response to social distancing associated with low neuroticism and non-avoidant
  coping, leading to no disorder.
