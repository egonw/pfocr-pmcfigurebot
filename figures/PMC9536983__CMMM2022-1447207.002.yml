caption: 'Effect of abnormal MSC-AS1 effect on C666-1 cell proliferation, migration,
  and invasion. (a) The transfection efficiency was tested by qRT-PCR analysis. The
  expression of MSC-AS1 was remarkably accumulated in the pcDNA-MSC-AS1 group and
  significantly declined in the si-MSC-AS1 group compared with controls. ∗p < 0.05,
  ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001. (b) The cell viability changes disturbed by MSC-AS1
  dysregulation were detected by MTT assay. Cell viability was significantly reduced
  in the si-MSC-AS1 group. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001. (c) cell proliferation
  was observed by cell colony formation assay. The colony formation ability was significantly
  elevated in the pcDNA-MSC-AS1 group and obviously decreased in the si-MSC-AS1 group.
  NS: no significant difference; ∗∗∗p < 0.001. Cell wound scratch assay (d) and transwell
  invasion assay (e) were performed to observe the changes in migration and invasion
  of C666-1 cells induced by MSC-AS1 deregulation. The cell migration and invasion
  were all significantly enhanced in the pcDNA-MSC-AS1 group and reduced in the si-MSC-AS1
  group. NS: no significant difference; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001.'
