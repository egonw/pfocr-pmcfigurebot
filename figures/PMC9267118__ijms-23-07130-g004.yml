caption: Cucurbitacin B inhibited TNF-α-induced IκBα phosphorylation and its subsequent
  degradation. (A–F) A549 cells were pretreated with or without cucurbitacin B for
  1 h and were then treated with (+) or without (−) TNF-α (2.5 ng/mL) for 5 min (A–D)
  and 15 min (E,F) in the presence or absence of cucurbitacin B at the indicated final
  concentrations, followed by the preparation of cytoplasmic fractions. Western blots
  are representative of three independent experiments (A,C,F). The amounts of phospho-IκBα
  and IκBα were normalized to that of GAPDH. Phospho-IκBα protein (%) and IκBα protein
  (%) are shown as the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments (B,D,F). * p <
  0.05, ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001.
