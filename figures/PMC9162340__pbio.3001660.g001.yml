figure_title: Punt exhibits basolateral membrane localization in the wing disc
caption: '(A) Schematic showing apical–basal features of the wing disc epithelium.
  Stereotypical folds bring 2 surfaces near each other with apical sides in apposition.
  Confocal images through the folds thus reveal the apical–basal polarity axis of
  the columnar epithelial cells. (B) Tkv expressed with nub-GAL4 was detected at the
  SJ (marked with FasIII or Dlg), as well as basal, lateral, and apical membranes
  (marked by aPKC stripe). Tkv2 was visualized by IF using an antibody specific to
  this isoform (B). See  for additional Tkv localization tests. (C–G) GFP fluorescence
  signal conveys the membrane distribution of Type II receptors relative to junctions.
  Punt-GFP was largely excluded from the SJ (Dlg) and apical (aPKC) regions but detected
  at basolateral surfaces (C). Wit-GFP is enriched at the apical membrane but also
  detected basolaterally (D). (E–F) Apicobasal distribution of GFP-tagged proteins
  shown by xz projections of confocal z-sections. Apical (Ap) and Basal (Ba) sides
  are labeled. mCD8::GFP driven by A9-Gal4 was distributed through the columnar epithelial
  cells, with clear overlap at the SJ (E). Punt-GFP was excluded from the SJ and apical
  areas, displaying basolateral restriction (F), whereas Wit-GFP exhibited broad membrane
  localization with prominent overlap with the SJ and apical regions (G). (H, I) Endogenous-level
  tagged constructs confirm differential localization of Punt and Wit. Punt-GFP (H)
  or Wit-GFP (I) were detected by anti-GFP IF and analyzed as for Panels C and D;
  apical localization of Wit-GFP is inferred by staining apical to the SJ. Single
  prime (′) images are magnified views where 2 portions of the epithelium lean toward
  each other. Double prime (′′) images are intensity profiles perpendicular to the
  line demarcated by the junction staining (yellow arrowheads in single prime panels;
  see  for schematic of profile markers). Scale bars: 100 μm for B, C, D, H, I; 15
  μm for B′, C′, D′, E, F, G, H′, I′. IF, immunofluorescence; SJ, septate junction.'
