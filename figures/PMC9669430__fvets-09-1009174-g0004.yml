caption: Divergent expression patterns of mRNAs in melanocytes isolated from Boer
  goat skins with white and brown hairs. (A,B) Divergent expression patterns of mRNAs
  in melanocytes. (C,D) DEG annotation results were obtained using the KEGG database;
  the red symbol marks positive regulatory genes, the blue marks negative regulatory
  genes, and the green marks key signaling pathway.
article_title: A genome-wide integrated analysis of lncRNA-mRNA in melanocytes from
  white and brown skin hair boer goats (Capra aegagrus hircus).
