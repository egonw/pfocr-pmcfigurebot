caption: KAT5 promotes PI3K/Akt signaling by epigenetically inducing PI3K expression
  in EAC mice. (Aâ€“F) The EAC mouse model was established followed by the indicated
  treatment. (A and B) The expression of PI3K and Akt and the phosphorylation of PI3K
  and Akt were measured by Western blotting. (C and D) The levels of H3K27ac were
  detected by Western blotting. (E and F) The enrichment of KAT5 and H3K27ac on the
  promoter of PI3K was analyzed by ChIP. **P < 0.01.
