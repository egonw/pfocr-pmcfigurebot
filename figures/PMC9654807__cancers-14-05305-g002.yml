caption: 'Reported frequencies of DDR alterations in NSCLC and SCLC. (A) Frequency
  of HR-DDR mutations from Caris cohort in NSCLC and SCLC represented in pie charts
  and, to the right of the panel, the reported frequencies of most common mutated
  HR-DDR genes in NSCLC (green) and SCLC (blue). (B) Selected reported frequencies
  in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) (n = 230) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC)
  (n = 178) from the TCGA database in NSCLC. (C) Mutation frequency in major DDR functional
  pathways in NSCLC from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute cohort (n = 266), with blue
  bar charts representing frequency of the major DDR pathway mutations, and red dots
  representing specific highly mutated genes within the major DDR pathway. *: This
  cohort include metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with PD-(L)1
  inhibitors.'
