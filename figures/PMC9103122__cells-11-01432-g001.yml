caption: Role of DJ-1 in ferroptotic cells. In basal conditions, the intake of cystine
  is the driving force for GSH generation. During ferroptotic stress, DJ-1 level is
  a determining factor in the survival of the cells. In Erastin treated cells, the
  high levels of DJ-1 preserves the survival of cells by inducing the transsulfuration
  pathway. Conversely, low levels of DJ-1 inhibit the transsulfuration pathway, decrease
  the generation of GSH, and induce ferroptosis.
