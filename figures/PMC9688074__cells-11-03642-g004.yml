caption: Mechanism of lncRNAs in acute renal injury. LncRNA CCAT1 inhibits the activation
  of NF-κB via regulating the miR-155/SIRT1 axis. Paclitaxel binds to MD-2 to block
  MD-2/TLR4 association, resulting in the suppression of NF-κB activation. In addition,
  paclitaxel can protect against AKI via the regulation of lncRNA MALAT1/miR-370-3p/HMGB1
  axis. Knockdown of lncRNA MALAT1 inhibits the activation of NF-κB by targeting miR-146a.
  Curcumin attenuates the activation of the JNK/NF-κB signaling pathway by inhibiting
  lncRNA PVT1, thereby alleviating the inflammatory response in AKI.
