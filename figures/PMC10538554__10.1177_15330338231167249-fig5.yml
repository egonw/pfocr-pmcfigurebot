caption: DOT1L activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR) signaling pathway by direct regulation of Farnesoid X receptor (FXR). (A
  and B) qPCR was performed to detect FXR expression levels in SGC0946 treatment 786-O
  cells or DOT1L knockdown 786-O cells. (C and D) The protein levels of FXR were detected
  by Western blot in SGC0946 treatment 786-O cells or DOT1L knockdown 786-O cells.
  (E) H3K79me2 ChIP-seq in ENCODE database showing FXR promoter in humans. (F) Schematic
  diagram showed the location of 5 pairs of primers in FXR promoter regions. (G) ChIP
  assays were performed using H3K79me2 antibody in 786-O cells to detect the binding
  sites in FXR promoter regions. (H) ChIP-qPCR assays were performed using H3K79me2
  antibody in 786-O cells. The normalized expression in 786-O cells was input. (I)
  786-O cells were treated with SGC0946, then treated with Guggulsterone (20 μM) or
  INT767 (10 μM) for 24 h and harvested for Western blot.
