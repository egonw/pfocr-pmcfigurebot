caption: 'Effects of KAN0438757 (KAN) on the cytotoxicity and proliferation of nucleus
  pulposus primary (NPP) cells in vitro. (a) The chemical structure of KAN. (b) Cell
  viability of KAN-treated NPPs was tested by CCK-8 at 24 hours. (c–f) Cell proliferation
  effect of NPPs treated by negative control or different concentrations KAN was tested
  by CCK-8 at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. Data are expressed as mean ± SD, n = 4‐6.
