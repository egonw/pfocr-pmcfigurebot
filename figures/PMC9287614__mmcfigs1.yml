caption: 'Total CaMKII isoforms in human skeletal muscle in response to incremental
  exercise to exhaustion in normoxia and severe hypoxia, and post-exercise ischaemia.
  Levels of protein expression of (A) Total CaMKII βM, (B) Total CaMKII δA, and (C)
  Total CaMKII γ. Total CaMKII δD is included in Fig. 2E. Nx: normoxia session (FIO2
  = 0.21, PIO2 = 143 mmHg); Hyp: severe normobaric hypoxia session (FIO2 = 0.104,
  PIO2 = 73 mmHg); Pre: before exercise; Post: 10 s after exercise cessation during
  ischaemic recovery; Oc1m: 60 s after exercise cessation during ischaemic recovery;
  FC1m: 60 s after exercise cessation during recovery with free circulation. n = 11
  for all conditions except for Oc1m Nx (n = 9). See  for a detailed description of
  the experimental phases. Values presented are means ± standard errors and expressed
  in arbitrary units (a.u.). No statistically significant effects were detected.'

  muscle revealed by high-intensity exercise and ischaemia at exhaustion: Role of
