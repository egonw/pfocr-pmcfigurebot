caption: Model of E. chaffeensis TRP120 ligand SLiM activation of Hedgehog, Wnt, and
  Notch signaling pathways and downstream effects. The TRP120 Hedgehog ligand SLiM
  binds to the Hedgehog receptor (PTCH) to activate the GLI-1 zinc finger transcription
  factor. GLI1 translocation to the nucleus activates the transcription of the anti-apoptosis
  target genes such as BCL-2. In the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, the TRP120 Wnt
  ligand SLiM directly engages Fzd (Frizzled) 5 and recruits coreceptor LRP5/6 (lipoprotein
  receptor-related protein 5 and 6). Activation of Wnt signaling results in the disassembly
  of the β-catenin destruction complex [consisting of Axin, APC (adenomatous polyposis
  coli), GSK3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta), and CK1 (casein kinase)], which
  allows accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm and subsequent nuclear translocation
  and activation of Wnt target pro-infection genes and Wnt signaling promotes PI3K
  (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)/Akt signaling and downstream suppression of autophagy.
  The TRP120 Notch ligand SLiM interacts with ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase
  17) and the Notch1 receptor resulting in receptor cleavage and nuclear translocation
  of NICD (Notch intracellular domain), the transcriptionally active form that interacts
  with Notch RBPjk (recombinant binding protein suppressor of hairless involved in
  Notch signaling) and MAML (mastermind-like protein 1) transcription factors proteins.
  This transcription complex activates transcription of Notch target genes, resulting
  in inhibition of ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinases) and p38 MAPK (p38
  mitogen-activated protein kinase) phosphorylation pathway and the downstream transcription
  factor PU.1 expression is repressed, inhibiting TLR2/4 expression and apoptosis.
