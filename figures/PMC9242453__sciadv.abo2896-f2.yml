figure_title: The majority of rhythmic regulation of circulating metabolites is driven
  by the central clock
caption: (A) Venn diagram representing the overlap of significantly oscillating (JTK,
  P < 0.05) serum metabolites between WT, Bmal1 KO mice, and Bmal1 brain-RE (BRE).
  (B) Heatmaps representing the oscillating metabolites in WT only (left heatmap),
  overlapping between WT and BRE (middle heatmap) and in BRE only (right heatmap).
  (C) Radar plots illustrating the phase of the metabolic oscillations in WT only
  (left radar plot), overlapping between WT and BRE (middle radar plot), and in BRE
  only (right radar plot). (D) Graph displaying the amplitudes of the overlapping
  metabolites between WT and BRE. Significant difference was assessed by paired t
  test. (E) The change in amplitude within each pathway in BRE mice in relation to
  WT. (F) Pathway enrichment of oscillating metabolites overlapping between WT and
  BRE. (G) Phase of metabolites in the major oscillating metabolic classes. *P < 0.05.
  All analyses were performed using n = 4 mice.
