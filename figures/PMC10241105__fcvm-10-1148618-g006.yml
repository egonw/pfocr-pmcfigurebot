caption: Gene regulatory networks of downregulated miRNAs after postnatal day 9 and
  miRNAs associated with mitochondrial genes. (A,B) GO biological processes with enriched
  verified target genes of miRNAs that were downregulated in the P23–P09 comparison.
  The data has been divided into two chord diagrams for clarity of presentation. (C)
  KEGG pathways enriched by verified target genes of miRNAs downregulated in the P23–P09
  comparison. (A–C) The enrichment of the target genes of each miRNA with the GO biological
  processes and KEGG pathways (p ≤ 0.05) are presented with a single color in the
  chord diagrams. The size of the section representing each GO term or KEGG pathway
  is proportional to the number of target genes associated with the corresponding
  GO term or KEGG pathway. (D) Chord diagram demonstrating that verified target genes
  of miRNAs enriched in mitochondria-associated GO cellular components. The enrichment
  of the target genes of each miRNA with the GO cellular component are presented with
  a single color. Gene-regulatory networks of miRNAs from P09–P01 comparison are shown
  in black color. (E) Sankey plot showing mitochondria-associated GO:CC enriched in
  verified target genes of downregulated miRNAs in the P23–P09 comparison.
