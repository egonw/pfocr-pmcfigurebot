caption: Expression levels of PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β pathway-related proteins in intestinal
  tissue of NEC mice. Immunofluorescence staining results of GSK-3β (a) and fluorescence
  intensity (b) in intestinal tissues of mice in each group, n = 6, and expression
  of PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β pathway-related proteins in intestinal tissue of mice, n = 3.
  NEC, necrotizing enterocolitis; SFN, sulforaphane. Compared with the control group,
  ▲P < 0.05, ▲▲P < 0.01; compared with the NEC group, ★P < 0.05, ★★P < 0.01. Data
  represent the mean ± SD.

  by Regulating the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β Signaling Pathway.
