caption: 'Effects of Procyanidin B2, a representative component of SC. (A) HepG2 cells
  were treated with 10 μM PCB2, 30 μM LQ, DZ, and GS for 1 h and then incubated with
  10 μM AA plus some drugs for 12 h, followed by incubation with 5 μM iron for 6 h.
  The cell viability was assessed using an MTT assay. (B) HepG2 cells were treated
  with PCB2 (3, 10, 30 μM) for 1 h, and then proceeded sequentially as described in
  (A). The data represent the mean ± SD (** p < 0.01 between the control and AA +
  iron-treated cells; ## p < 0.01 between AA + iron and AA + iron-treated cells with
  compounds). (C) Immunoblotting analysis to verify the expression of the AMPK signaling
  pathway was performed with HepG2 cell lysates. The cells were incubated in serum-free
  media for 12 h, followed by treatment with 10 μM PCB2 for the indicated time.'
