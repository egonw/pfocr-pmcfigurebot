caption: 'Immunohistochemistry shows generalized AKT activation and ocassional STAT3
  activation in primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma. (A) Activation of
  the P-I-3K/AKT pathway (pAKT) was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on tumor
  tissue from 7 of 8 evaluated patients (i.e., cAL3-4/7-12). Tumor cells exhibited
  activated AKT in the nucleus and the cytoplam. (B) Activation of STAT3 signaling
  (pSTAT3) was detected by IHC on tumor tissue from three of eight evaluated patients.
  Tumor cells displayed activated STAT3 in the nucleus. Normal skin (control) displayed
  AKT and STAT3 activation in keratinocytes and endothelial cells. NHS: normal human
  skin. Scale bar, 50 mm.'
