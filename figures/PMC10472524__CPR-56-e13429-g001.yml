caption: Decellularised spinal cord matrix (DSCM)‐regulated human spinal cord‐derived
  primary astrocytes (hspASCs) maturation via activation of serglycin (SRGN)–CD44–AKT
  signalling. (A) Western blotting and qualification show the level of p‐AKT in hspASCs
  under DSCM/COLI condition. **p < 0.01 (t‐test, mean ± SEM). (B) Quantitative polymerase
  chain reaction (qPCR) detects the relative gene expression of hspASCs incubated
  48 h with LY294002 under DSCM condition. **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001 (t‐test, mean ± SEM).
  (C) KEGG and GO enrichment analysis of significantly down‐regulation genes of hspASCs
  treated with LY294002 under DSCM condition. (D) Western blotting identifies the
  protein content of SRGN in DSCM/COLI hydrogel. The sample was obtained from three
  independent experiments. The total protein content loaded in each well is 40 μg.
  (E) Schematic of the principle of design SRGN‐COLI. (F) Western blotting analysis
  of the His‐SRGN level in hspASCs cultured on COLI, His‐SRGN‐COLI, and DSCM hydrogel
  for 5 days. (G) Cryo‐SEM image of hspASCs under COLI/SRGN‐COLI condition (Bar = 20 μm;
  Bar = 4 μm). (H) qPCR analysis of the relative gene expression in hspASCs under
  COLI/SRGN‐COLI condition (48 h). *p < 0.05; ***p < 0.001 (t‐test, mean ± SEM). (I)
  qPCR analysis of the relative gene expression of hspASC under DSCM condition with
  or without CD44 blocking. Mouse normal Igg was used as a control. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01;
  ***p < 0.001 (t‐test, mean ± SEM).
