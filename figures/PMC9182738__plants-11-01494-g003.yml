caption: Enrichment analysis of metabolic pathways in L. chinensis seedlings. Circle
  color from shallow to deep represents pâˆ’value from large to small, circle. radius
  from small to large represents impact value from small to large. The deeper the
  circle color, the greater the radius represents the greater the impact of alkali
  stress on the pathway. The circle closer to the upper right corner of the pathway
  diagram represents the more significant effect of alkali stress on this metabolic
  pathway.
