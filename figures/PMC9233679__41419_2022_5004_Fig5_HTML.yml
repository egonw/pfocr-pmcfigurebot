figure_title: S100A11 affects the activity of the TKT promoter
caption: A RT-qPCR analysis of TKT mRNA expression in PDAC cells with or without S100A11
  knockdown. Samples were normalised to GAPDH mRNA. B Transcriptomic analysis of TKT
  nascent mRNA expression was performed in control and S100A11-knockdown PDAC cells.
  C Relative activity of the TKT promoter containing firefly luciferase reporter treated
  with or without S100A11 knockdown. D Representative immunohistochemical staining
  with S100A11 protein in PDAC tissues. E Immunofluorescence showed the subcellular
  localisation of S100A11 in pancreatic cancer cells. F Chromatin prepared from BxPC3
  was incubated with anti-S100A11 and IgG antibody. ChIP assay was carried out and
  the TKT promoter in different domains was amplified. *p < 0.05. N.S., not significant.
  Error bars indicate mean ± SD.
