  were observed in the Schaffer Collateral (SC) pathway of the dHPC in Cnih3−/− female
  mice during metestrus
caption: '(A) Example western blot images from male and female Cnih3+/+ (male: n =
  8; female: n = 13) and Cnih3−/− (male: n = 8; female: n = 12) animals. Each lane
  represents dHPC synaptosomal fractions obtained from a single animal. Female samples
  were collected during proestrus and metestrus stages for both Cnih3+/+ (proestrus:
  n = 6; metestrus: n = 7) and Cnih3−/− (proestrus: n = 5; metestrus: n = 7) genotypes.
  In both the female Cnih3+/+ and Cnih3−/− proestrus datasets, one sample was removed
  from the analysis due to incorrect estrous cycle stage. Blots were probed for GluA1,
  P-GluA1 (Ser845), and HKPs β-actin (used for normalization) and β-tubulin. Datasets
  were normalized to within-sex and within-blot Cnih3+/+ controls, data is shown as
  normalized percentages to the baseline average of Cnih3+/+ controls (set at 100%).
  (B) Quantification of GluA1 separated by sex (Two-tailed unpaired t test, Cnih3+/+
  vs. Cnih3−/−: male: p = 0.7734, female: p = 0.7579; if normalize female Cnih3+/+
  to male Cnih3+/+ average: male Cnih3+/+ vs. female Cnih3+/+ p = 0.8245) and estrous
  cycle stage (Two-way ANOVA, Estrous: F(1, 21) = 2.395, p = 0.1367; Genotype: F(1,
  21) = 0.07012, p = 0.7937; Estrous x Genotype: F(1, 21) = 0.03265, p = 0.8583).
  (C) P-GluA1 (Ser845) separated by sex (Two-tailed unpaired t test, male: p = 0.7284,
  female: Cnih3+/+ combined female dataset did not pass the Shapiro-Wilk normality
  test, nonparametric two-tailed Mann-Whitney test, p = 0.9362; if normalize female
  Cnih3+/+ to male Cnih3+/+ average: male Cnih3+/+ vs. female Cnih3+/+ p = 0.4558)
  and estrous cycle stage (Two-way ANOVA, Estrous: F(1, 21) = 9.935, p = 0.0048; Genotype:
  F(1, 21) = 0.1828, p = 0.6734; Estrous x Genotype: F(1, 21) = 6.723e−6, p = 0.9980;
  Post-hoc Sidak’s multiple comparisons test between proestrus and metestrus, Cnih3+/+:
  p = 0.0639; Cnih3−/−: p = 0.0812). (D) Example western blots from the same samples
  used in panels A – C, probed for GluA2, P-GluA1 (Tyr876), and HKPs β-actin (used
  for normalization) and β-tubulin (used for normalization in one blot due to inconsistent
  actin staining). (E) Quantification of GluA2 separated by sex (see  for relevant
  statistical outlier) (Two-tailed unpaired t test, male: p = 0.1769, female: p =
  0.0618) and estrous cycle stage (Two-way ANOVA, Estrous: F(1, 20) = 13.45, p = 0.0015;
  Genotype: F(1, 20) = 3.077, p = 0.0947; Estrous x Genotype: F(1, 20) = 3.768, p
  = 0.0665; post-hoc Sidak’s multiple comparisons test, p = 0.0076 compared to Cnih3+/+
  females in proestrus, p = 0.0035 compared to Cnih3−/− females in proestrus, p =
  0.0523 compared to Cnih3+/+ females in metestrus). (F) P-GluA2 (Tyr876) separated
  by sex (Two-tailed unpaired t test, male: p = 0.9800, female: p = 0.1243) and estrous
  cycle stage (Two-way ANOVA, Estrous: F(1, 20), = 2.698, p = 0.1161; Genotype: F(1,
  20) = 1.630, p = 0.2163; Estrous x Genotype: F(1, 20) = 0.9555, p = 0.3400). (G)
  Schematic of field potential recording from the SC pathway of the dHPC in slice.
  Female mice were chosen for LTP experiments during the metestrus phase due to memory
  deficits and biochemical dysregulation observed during this stage in Cnih3−/− female
  mice. Representative image of a stained vaginal lavage sample from a female animal
  in metestrus. (H) Time course of LTP under standard conditions (2 mM Ca2+, 2 mM
  Mg2+ in ASCF) for Cnih3+/+ (n = 5) and Cnih3−/− female mice (n = 5) in the metestrus
  stage of the estrous cycle. Following 10 min of baseline fEPSPs, the SC pathway
  was subjected to HFS to induce LTP (1 min after HFS stimulation, Two-tailed unpaired
  t test, p = 0.8703). (I) Comparison of half-maximal fEPSP slope (presented as %
  baseline) 1 hr post-HFS between Cnih3+/+ and Cnih3−/− metestrus females (two-tailed
  Mann-Whitney test, p = 0.0079). (J) Time course of LTP under higher Ca2+ and lower
  Mg2+ conditions during TBS (2.5 mM Ca2+, 1.3 mM Mg2+ in ASCF) for Cnih3+/+ (n =
  5) and Cnih3−/− female mice (n = 5) in the metestrus stage of the estrous cycle.
  TBS was applied after 10 min of baseline recordings to induce LTP. (K) Comparison
  of half-maximal fEPSP slope 1 hr post-TBS under high Ca2+ conditions between Cnih3+/+
  and Cnih3−/− metestrus female mice (Unpaired two-tailed t test, p = 0.3711).'
