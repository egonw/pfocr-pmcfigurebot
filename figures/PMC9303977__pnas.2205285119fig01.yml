caption: Biosynthesis of natural products on a carrier peptide. (A) During polyketide
  and NRP biosynthesis, the biosynthetic building blocks and intermediates are linked
  to a carrier protein via a thioester bond. During pearlin biosynthesis, an amino
  acid is linked to a carrier peptide via an amide bond. (B) The biosynthetic pathway
  of 3-thiaGlu. TglA is the carrier peptide. (C) The tmo BGC and the reconstituted
  biosynthetic pathway of 3-thiahomoleucine. The stereochemistry of the final product
  is based on inference from the 3-thiaGlu pathway.
