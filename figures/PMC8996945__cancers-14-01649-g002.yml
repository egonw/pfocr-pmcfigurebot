caption: 'The notch pathway. Construction of the receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum
  and Golgi is followed by cleavage of NECD from TM-NICD with the converting enzyme
  TACE. The processed NECD is endosome-transported in the-signal sending-cell plasma
  membrane where it is recycled. Î³-secretase releases NICD from TM in the signal-receiving
  cell and the NICD part enters nucleus and with the activation of CSL transcription
  factor complex allows nuclear translocation resulting in activation of the canonical
  notch target genes (Permission by Yap LF, Lee D, Khairuddin A, Pairan MF, Puspita
