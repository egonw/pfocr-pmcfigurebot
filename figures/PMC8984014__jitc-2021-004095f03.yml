caption: Differentially expressed gene and pathway analysis using the bulk RNA-seq
  from TCGA SKCM cohort. (A) Differential gene expression analyses were performed
  in primary and metastatic cohorts using the quasi-likelihood pipeline of edgeR.
  The p value for differential expression was determined by the quasi-likelihood F-test
  and adjusted for multiple hypotheses testing. Genes with FDR < 0.05 were determined
  as differentially expressed between BRAF-mutant and BRAF-wt samples. (B) The enrichment
  of MsigDB Hallmark gene set collection in BRAF-mutant samples compared with BRAF-wt
  samples was tested using fry in limma R/Bioconductor package. FDR, false discovery
  rate; SKCM, skin cutaneous melanoma; TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas.
