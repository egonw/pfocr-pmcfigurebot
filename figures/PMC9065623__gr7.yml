caption: Myricetin induces apoptosis via Akt pathway in a xenograft model. (A) Protein
  expressions forp-Akt, Bax and Bcl-2 were observed by western blotting. The blots
  were also probed with β-actin antibody to confirm equal sample loading. (B) The
  p-Akt positive cells were observed under a light microscope (scale bar, 10 μm).
  Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD); ∗p < 0.05 vs. control group.
