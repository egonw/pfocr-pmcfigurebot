caption: Gene expression and analysis of biological activity of BMSCs cultured in
  Hyd_Lap and Hyd groups. (a) Volcano plots showing mRNA expression profiles of BMSCs
  cultured in the two groups (red represents upregulated genes, blue represents downregulated
  genes). (b) Heat map showing expression levels of osteogenesis-associated genes
  identified by GO enrichment analysis. (c) KEGG pathway gene enrichment analysis.
  The PI3K/AKT pathway, highlighted with a red box, was highly enriched. (For interpretation
  of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
  Web version of this article.)
