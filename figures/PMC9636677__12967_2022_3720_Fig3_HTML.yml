caption: 'The effect of exosomes on ESCC cells. A Radiation-induced changes of HMGB1
  in exosomes. B The CCK8 assay detected cell proliferation. C The radiosensitivity
  of ESCC cells was measured by clone formation assay. D At the mRNA level, HMGB1
  mRNA expression in the HMGB1 group was obviously lower than that in the NC group.
  E HMGB1 knockdown cell lines KYSE150 and ECA109 were successfully constructed at
  the protein level. F The expression of HMGB1 in exosomes of knockdown cell lines
  was significantly lower than that of the NC group. G Cell proliferation was detected
  by CCK8 assay. Cell viability in the IR-shHMGB1-Exos group was lower than that in
  the IR-NC-Exos group. H The radiosensitivity of ESCC cells was measured by a clone
  formation assay. IR-shHMGB1-Exos group alleviated radioresistance. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01
  and ***P < 0.001; a comparison with the corresponding non-irradiated group is indicated
  by triangles ▲P < 0.05, ▲▲P < 0.01 and ▲▲▲P < 0.001. CCK-8: Cell Counting Kit-8;
