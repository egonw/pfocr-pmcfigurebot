caption: Molecular docking of IL‐6 to Dexamethasone (Dexa) or potassium canrenoate
  (Cane). (A and D) Docked model of IL‐6 (in carton mode) bound to Dexa or Cane (indicated
  by cyan in white boxes) with a binding energy of −7.21 kcal/mol and −6.98 kcal/mol,
  respectively. (B and E) Magnified view of the docked structure showing the contact
  between IL‐6 and Dexa (B) or Cane (E), respectively. (C and F) 2D ligand‐molecular
  interaction diagram. Both Dexa (C) and Cane (F) interact with the residues of binding
  sites of IL‐6, and both competitively bind to THR138 binding site by the formation
  of the hydrogen bond. IL‐6, interleukin‐6.

  regulating IL‐6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway during inflammatory pain in vivo and
  in vitro.
