caption: Schematic of the Hedgehog signaling pathway. In the absence of Hedgehog (Hh)
  ligands (left), Patched (PTCH) inhibits the G protein-coupled receptor, SMO. Protein
  kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates glioma-associated (Gli) transcription factors, which
  then undergo proteolytic cleavage from the suppressor of fused (SuFu) to generate
  the repressor form (Glir). Glir hinders transcription of the Hh genes and turns
  the pathway off. In the presence of Hh ligands (right), PTCH is bound by the Hh
  ligand, resulting in the phosphorylation of SMO. Gli transcription factors dissociate
  from SuFu and generate the activator form (Glia). Glia promotes the transcription
  of the Hh genes and turns the pathway on. In the presence of a Hh pathway inhibitor
  such as cyclopamine, SMO will remain inactivated and PKA will phosphorylate Gli
  transcription factors; thus, this will generate the Glir that inhibits transcription
  []. (Graphic created with BioRender.com.)
