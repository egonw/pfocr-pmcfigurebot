figure_title: Activation of IKK‐NF‐κB pathway by ADP heptose requires Wnt and Rspo
caption: 'Antrum organoids from wildtype mice were grown in full medium (FM) for 2–3 days,
  followed by respective medium conditions for 3–5 days (FM, −Rspo, −Rspo/‐Wnt, +BMP2).
  0.5 μM ADP heptose was added for 2 h to all organoid conditions prior to analysis.
  AElectrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and SDS–PAGE western blot from whole‐cell
  protein (WCL) lysates from gastric organoids untreated or treated with ADP heptose,
  and maintained either in FM in medium without Rspo, without Wnt and Rspo, or + BMP2.

  supershift from FM + ADP heptose organoids with the antibodies indicated. Blue arrow
  indicates NF‐κB binding. Red arrow points to gel expected locations of supershifts
  from antibodies against p65, cRel, or RelB. Gray arrow points to supershift location
  on the gel from antibodies against p52 or p50. IgG lane serves as a negative control.
  Data information: For (B) data are mean + SD. Significance is calculated by one‐way
  ANOVA, F = 9.21. Source data are available online for this figure.'
