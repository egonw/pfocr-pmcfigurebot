caption: NCI-H1299R175H influences the MAPK pathway. (A) GSEA showed that in response
  to NCI-H1299R175H expression, gene sets were significantly enriched in the MAPK
  pathway. (B) Heatmap showing differentially expressed genes in the MAPK pathway.
  (C,D) Real-time PCR was performed to detect the mRNA levels of key genes in the
  MAPK pathway in NCI-H1299R175H cells (normal/shHSP70) with or without triptolide
  treatment, and ACTB was used as the internal control. Similar results were obtained
  with 3 independent experiments. *, P<0.05. MAPK, mitogen activated protein kinase;
  GSEA, Gene set enrichment analysis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; mRNA, messenger
