caption: Effect of cilostazol on the mRNA levels of ET-1 and eNOS in HUVECs following
  treatment with cilostazol. (A) ET-1 mRNA levels were measured by PCR. (B) eNOS mRNA
  levels were measured by PCR. The results are presented as the mean Â± SEM of three
  repeats. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001. ET-1, endothelin-1; eNOS, endothelial nitric
  oxide synthase.
article_title: Cilostazol regulates the expressions of endothelin-1 and endothelial
  nitric oxide synthase via activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway in HUVECs.
