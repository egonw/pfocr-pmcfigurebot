caption: 'Relative amount as well as western blots of phosphorylated key enzymes of
  the insulin signaling pathway. The number of identical symbols at top of each box
  indicate the significance level: one < 0.05; two < 0.01 and three < 0.001. Expression
  values were normalised to total protein. Protein kinase b = Akt; phosphorylated
  Protein kinase B = pAkt; glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3); phosphorylated
  glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (pGSK3); Glycogen synthase = GS; phosphorylated
  Glycogen synthase (pGS); contralateral = cl; operated = op; sham-operated = sham
