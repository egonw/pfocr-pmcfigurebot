figure_title: ALK overexpression is associated with distinct transcriptional changes
  in NEPC
caption: A. Heatmap depicting expression differences between 10 tumors of the UW rapid
  autopsy cohort with low/no ALK expression and eight tumors with high ALK expression.
  Shown are mean centered log2 fold changes for 137 upregulated and 157 downregulated
  gens with FDR<0.05. B. Gene set enrichment analysis for Hallmark Pathway gene sets
  show distinct expression differences in pathways involved in cellular proliferation
  and MYC signaling. C. Transcription factor signature enriched in ALK overexpressing
  tumors. All pathways shown have enrichment FDR<0.05. D. Kaplan Meier survival plot
  shows shortened overall survival of patients with high ALK mRNA expression in the
  Stand Up to Cancer International Dream Team cohort.
