caption: Identification of DEGs in the spleen and colon from Npr1−/− mice at the age
  of 4 weeks. a GO enrichment analysis of DEGs (log2 fold-change > 1.5 and p < 0.05)
  in the spleen from WT and Npr1−/− mice (n = 3). The rich ratio is the ratio of the
  DEG number and the number of all genes in a certain enrichment pathway. The dot
  size denotes the number of DEGs, the colors denotes the adjusted Q-value range.
  b A heat map for immune-related DEGs in the spleen from WT and Npr1−/− mice (n = 3).
  The color intensity indicates the relative expression levels of up-regulated (red)
  and down-regulated (blue) DEGs. c GO enrichment analysis of DEGs in the colon from
  WT and Npr1−/− mice (n = 3). d A heat map for immune-related DEGs in the colon of
  WT and Npr1−/− mice (n = 3).
