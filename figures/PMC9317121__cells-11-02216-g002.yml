caption: Phylogenetic analysis of the BMP family. Relationship between BMP/GDF ligands,
  type I receptors, type II receptors, Smad proteins, and RGM in signal transduction.
  ActRIIA/B, activin type II receptor A or B; ALK, activin receptor-like kinase; BMP,
  bone morphogenic protein; BMPRI, BMP type receptor I; BMPRII, BMP type receptor
  II; GDF, growth differentiation factor; MSTN, myostatin; OP, osteogenic protein;
  RGM, repulsive guidance molecules; Vgr, Vg-related protein. The figure was partially
