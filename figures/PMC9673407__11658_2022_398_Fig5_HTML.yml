caption: TPRG1L was a direct target of tRF-3013b. A The enrichment between AGO2, AGO3,
  and tRF-3013b was detected by RIP-qPCR. B Potential tRF-3013b targets intersected
  by RNA-seq and miRDB. C Sequence of the predicted tRF-3013b binding site within
  the 3′-UTR of TPRG1L. Relative luciferase activity was detected after cotransfection
  of NC or tRF-3013b mimic and reporter plasmids into 293T cells. D Relative mRNA
  expression of potential target genes after transfection with NC or tRF-3013b mimic
  in GBC cells. E Relative mRNA expression of TPRG1L after overexpression and inhibition
  of tRF-3013b NOZ and GBC-SD cells. F IHC showing Ki-67 and TPRG1L protein expression
  in xenograft transfected Lv-NC or LV-tRF-3013b. G Relative protein expression of
  TPRG1L, p65, and p50 after overexpression and inhibition of tRF-3013b in NOZ and
  GBC-SD cells. H Enrichment plot of NF-κB signaling pathway analyzed with GSEA after
  transfection with NC or tRF-3013b mimic in NOZ cells. I TPRG1L expression level
  in 37 pairs of GBC and para-cancer tissues. J Linear regression analysis and paired
  t-test for determining the correlation between the expression levels of tRF-3013b
  and TPRG1L. ns P > 0.05, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001
