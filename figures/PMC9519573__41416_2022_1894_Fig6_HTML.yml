figure_title: STING gene expression is downregulated in SCLC and correlates with interferon
  response activation
caption: 'a Violin plot of STING gene expression across different lung cancer histopathology
  types. P value of the Wilcoxon test and the number of samples for each group are
  reported in the plot. b Violin plot of ssGSEA enrichment score of “GO: Response
  to Interferon Beta” gene set across different lung cancer histopathology types.
  P value of Wilcoxon test and the number of samples for each group are reported in
  the plot. c, d Violin plot of ssGSEA enrichment score of NF-kB-target and IRF-target
  gene sets, respectively, across different lung cancer histopathology types. P value
  of the Wilcoxon test and the number of samples for each group are reported in the
  plot. e Scatter plots of STING gene expression correlated to ssGSEA enrichment score
  of “GO: Response to Interferon Beta” gene set for each lung cancer type. Spearman
  correlation coefficient (R) and P value of correlation test are reported in each
  graph.'
article_title: Topoisomerase I poison-triggered immune gene activation is markedly
  reduced in human small-cell lung cancers by impairment of the cGAS/STING pathway.
