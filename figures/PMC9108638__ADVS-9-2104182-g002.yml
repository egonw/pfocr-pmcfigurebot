caption: 'A) Temperature profiles of PDA NPs at various concentrations after 808 nm
  laser (0.5 W cm−2) irradiation. B) Infrared thermal images of water and PDA NPs
  irradiated for 600 s (0.5 W cm−2). C) Temperature changes of PDA NPs (200 µg mL−1)
  in five consecutive cycles of photothermal irradiation (808 nm, 0.5 W cm−2) and
  natural cooling. D) TEM images of PDA and PPDA (scale bar: 100 nm). E) Size changes
  of PDA and PPDA NPs in PBS (pH = 7.4) in 24 h, n = 3. F) Size variations of PDA
  and PPDA after acidic PBS (pH = 6.2) treatment for 3.5 h. G) FTIR spectra of BPBA,
  PEG, and PBA‐PEG. H) FTIR spectra of PBA‐PEG, PDA, and PPDA, and I) shell shedding
  of PPDA after acid treatment. J) Schematic illustration of the pH‐responsive PBA‐PEG
  shell shedding. K) The PA signal produced by PPDA at different concentrations was
  linearly dependent on its concentration (R2 = 0.985). L) Loading amount and encapsulation
  efficiency of A2AR antagonist SCH58261.'
