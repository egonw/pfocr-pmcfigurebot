caption: 'ATP13A2 siRNA promotes zinc-induced activation of the ERK/P38 signaling
  pathway. The ATP13A2 siRNA and the negative control were transiently transfected
  into HEK293 α-synuclein-DsRed cells, and then the cells were treated or untreated
  with 75 μM ZnSO4 for 12 h. (a,b) ATP13A2 levels were detected using Western blotting
  and quantitative analyses ((a), representative pictures; (b), quantification). (c)
  The mRNA expression levels of ATP13A2 were determined via qRT-PCR using GAPDH as
  an internal control ((d,f) representative pictures; (e,g–k) quantification). The
  expression levels of p-α-synuclein (d,e) and LAMP-2a (f,g), the phosphorylation
  and total protein levels of ERK1/2 (f,h,i), p38 (f,j) and caspase 3 (f,k) were determined
  using Western blotting with β-actin as an internal control. Data are represented
  as the means ± SEM of at least three independent experiments. * p < 0.05, ** p <
  0.01 with respect to the control in the negative control group; # p < 0.05, ## p
  < 0.01 compared to the control in the ATP13A2 silencing group.'
