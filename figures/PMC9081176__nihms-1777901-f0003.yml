figure_title: p110β kinase inhibition decreases invasive CRPC
caption: 'A. Schematic view of drug treatment to Pten-null CRPC.B. p110β kinase inhibitor
  treatment decreased invasive lesions in CRPC. Histological views of representative
  prostates from drug-treated mice and control mice. IHC: anti-p63, p-Akt S473. Ventral
  prostate is shown. Scale bar indicates 50 μm.C. p110β kinase inhibition decreased
  CRPC tumor burden. Prostate tumor weights comparing drug-treated mice with control
  mice. For drug treatment, the dose of AZD6482 was 20mg/kg, while BYL719 was 45mg/kg,
  once daily in each case. For statistical analysis, the following numbers of mice
  were measured: AZD6482 treatment, 7 mice; Vehicle controls, 7 mice; BYL719 treatment,
  6 mice.D. Western blots of ventral prostate tissues indicated that p110β pharmacologic
  inhibition decreased the activation of the PI3K signal in Pten-null CRPC. Pten-null
  mice were surgically castrated at 8 weeks, and treated with either AZD6482 (p110β
  inhibitor) or BYL715 (p110α inhibitor) daily for 8 weeks.E. Histology of organoids
  derived from ventral prostate of Pten-null CRPC mice (H&E). Organoids showed strong
  epithelial marker expression (IHC: pan-cytoskeleton) and faint androgen receptor
  expression (IHC: AR). Scale bars indicate 50 μm.F. Immunoblotting of CRPC organoid
  lysates indicated activated PI3K pathway (IB: p-Akt S473) as a consequence of Pten
  deletion (IB: Pten). Immunoblotting of organoid lysates derived from Pten-null;
  ERG mice showed ERG overexpression (IB: Erg). Myc-Cap cells were a negative control
  for PI3K pathway activation. OPN1 organoids were generated from the ventral prostate
  of an aged mouse (2 years old) post castration surgery at 14.5 months. OPN2 organoids
  were derived from ventral prostate of an aged mouse (1.5 years old) post castration
  surgery at 12.5 weeks.G. p110β inhibitor treatment alone did not completely inhibit
  Pten-null CRPC organoid growth. OPN organoids were treated with 5μM AZD6482.'
