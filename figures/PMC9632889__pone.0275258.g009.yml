figure_title: Leonurine inhibited pyroptosis by regulating TGF-β/Smad2 signalling
  pathway in H9c2 cells stimulated by TGF-β
caption: '(A) Compared to H9c2 cells induced by TGF-β for thirty minutes, leonurine
  decreased the expressions of Smad2 phosphorylation and cleaved Caspase 1 (B) The
  ratio of Smad2 phosphorylation to Smad2 expression and the ratio of cleaved Caspase
  1 to Caspase 1 expression. (C) The fluorescence of Smad2 protein was detected under
  a confocal laser scanning microscope. Compare to TGF-β induced model group, the
  intensity fluorescence of Smad2 protein was weakened after leonurine treatment.
  #P<0.05, ##P<0.01, model group vs. control group; *P<0.05, ***P<0.001, 20 μM leonurine
