caption: BCKDK promotes OC cell migration. (a) Scratch wound assay demonstrating that
  SKOV3-Mock migrate faster than SKOV3-BCKDK cells. The dotted lines show the area
  where the scratch wound was created. The scratch wound assay was performed in triplicate
  experiments. (b) Scratch wound assay demonstrating that OVCAR3-Mock migrate faster
  than OVCAR3-BCKDK cells. The dotted lines show the area where the scratch wound
  was created. The scratch wound assay was performed in triplicate experiments. (c)
  Transwell assay. SKOV3-BCKDK have greater migration capacity than SKOV3-Mock cells.
  Representative images from transwell assays of SKOV3-Mock cells and SKOV3-BCKDK
  cells are shown. (d) Transwell assay. OVCAR3-BCKDK have greater migration capacity
  than OVCAR3-Mock cells. Representative images from transwell migration assays of
  OVCAR3-Mock cells and OVCAR3-BCKDK cells are shown (∗∗∗P < 0.001).
