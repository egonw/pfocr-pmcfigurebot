caption: 'Transfer RNA halves-1:33-Pro-TGG-1 is associated with lesion size and promotes
  oncogenesis in colorectal cancer cells. A: Correlation analysis of the lesion sizes
  and expressions of transfer RNA halves (tiRNA)-1:33-Pro-TGG-1 of SSLs. The X-axis
  represents the diameter of the lesion and the Y-axis represents the expression level
  of tiRNA-1:33-Pro-TGG-1. B: Lesions in the tiRNA-1:33-Pro-TGG-1 high-expression
  group are larger than that of the low-expression group. Lesions are divided into
  high- and low-expression groups based on the median tiRNA-1:33-Pro-TGG-1 expression
  levels. The lesion sizes are compared between the two groups. C and D: Correlation
  analysis of lesion sizes and the expressions of tiRNA-1:34-Thr-TGT-4-M2 and tiRNA-1:33-Gly-CCC-2
  of SSLs. E: 5′tiRNA-Pro-TGG is a type of 5′tiRNA that originated in tRNA-Pro-TGG-1.
  F: 5′tiRNA-Pro-TGG knockdown suppressed the proliferation of RKO cells compared
  to that of the scramble control as determined by CCK-8 assays. G and H: Wound-healing
  assays demonstrated that the overexpression of 5′tiRNA-Pro-TGG promotes cell migration
  and knockdown of 5′tiRNA-Pro-TGG inhibits cell migration when compared to those
  of the corresponding scramble control, respectively. The asterisk indicates a significant
  difference between the two groups (aP < 0.05). SSLs: Sessile serrated lesions; tiRNA:
  Transfer RNA halves.'
