caption: RORγ antagonists inhibit key cholesterol biosynthesis gene expression in
  mCRPC cells. (a) Heat map of mRNA expression of 21 cholesterol biosynthesis genes,
  as measured by qRT-PCR in 22Rv1 and C4-2B cells treated with 5 µM of XY018 for 48
  h, as compared to vehicle (DMSO), n = 3. (b) Heat map of mRNA expression changes
  in 21 cholesterol biosynthesis genes, as detected by RNA-seq in 22Rv1 cells treated
  with indicated concentrations of XY018 for 48 h, as compared to vehicle (DMSO).
  (c,d) Immunoblotting of proteins involved in cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in
  22Rv1 (c) and C4-2B (d) cells treated with indicated concentrations of XY018 for
  72 h.
