caption: 'Alterations of the IP8synthesis pathway reveal that kinetochore targeting
  depends on IP8 and not IP7 levels. (A) Schematic representation of part of the wild-type
  IP/IPP pathway from IP5 to IP8, and the changes in IP7 and IP8 in a S. pombe ipk1∆
  strain [] and a wild-type S. cerevisiae strain overexpressing KCS1 (red arrow) based
  on []. (B) Left: Live-cell images of ipk1+ and ipk1∆ strains endogenously expressing
  mal2+-gfp. Cells were grown at 30 °C. Scale bars, 10 µm. Right: Quantification of
  Mal2-GFP kinetochore fluorescence signals in each strain. Mean and SD: ipk1+ = 152.3
  AU ± 65.86; ipk1∆ = 213.1 AU ± 93.54. Number of kinetochore signals that were counted;
  ipk1+ = 243; ipk1∆ = 183. ***, p < 0.0001; Mann–Whitney U-Test. N = 2. (C) Left:
  Live-cell images of a wild-type strain that were transformed with either control
  plasmid or a plasmid harboring kcs1+ overexpressed via the nmt41 promoter. The cells
  were grown at 30 °C. Scale bars, 10 µm. Right: Quantification of Mal2-GFP fluorescence
  signals in each condition. Mean and SD: control plasmid = 205.5 AU ± 65.8; pkcs1+
  = 164.6 AU ± 63.39. Number of kinetochore signals that were counted; control n =
  594; pkcs1+ n = 609; ***, p < 0.0001; Mann–Whitney U-Test. N = 2. (D) Serial dilution
  patch test (104–101 cells) of wild-type and mal2-1 strains that were transformed
  with the indicated plasmids and grown at 25 to 29 °C and with/without thiamine for
  4–8 days. One of n = 2–3 sets shown.'
