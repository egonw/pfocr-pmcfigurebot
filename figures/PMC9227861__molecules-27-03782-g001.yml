caption: Cytotoxic effect of SCU on RAW264.7 cells treated with or without LPS (1
  μg/mL) and treated with SCU(0, 25, 50, 75, 100, and 125 μM) at 37 °C for 24 h and
  48 h. (A) Chemical structure of SCU. (B) SCU (0, 25, 50, 75, 100, and 125 μM) was
  treated by concentration, and then the toxicity of SCU to cells for 24 h and 48
  h were measured. (C) Cell viability when LPS and SCU were treated together for 24
  h and 48 h. Comparison with SCU and LPS treated group * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, ***
  p < 0.001.
