caption: 'MG53 reduces oxidative stress in senescent hUC-MSCs by activating the Nrf2
  signaling pathway. (A) ROS production measured by DCFH-DA kit. (B) MDA level. (C)
  SOD viability. (D) Protein expression of Nrf2 signaling pathway in each group. (E)
  Densitometric analysis of Nrf2 expression in the nucleus. (F) Densitometric analysis
  of Keap1, NQO1, SOD1 and Nrf2 in the cytosol. Data were presented as mean ± SEM.
  Data were presented as mean ± SEM. N = 3 per group. *: Compared with P5 group, P < 0.05;
  #: Compared with P10 group, P < 0.05; Δ: Compared with P15, P < 0.05.'
