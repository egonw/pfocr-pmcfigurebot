caption: 'SIRT4 controls GDH enzyme activity, targeting glutamine metabolism in HSCs,
  inhibiting the activation and proliferation of HSCs, and ultimately alleviating
  liver fibrosis. Glutamine metabolic pathway: Glutamine is catalyzed by mitochondrial
  glutaminase (GLS) to produce glutamate and NH4+; Glutamate is converted into α-Ketoglutaric
  acid (α-KG) under the catalysis of GDH and enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle,
  providing energy for the rapidproliferation of cells.'
