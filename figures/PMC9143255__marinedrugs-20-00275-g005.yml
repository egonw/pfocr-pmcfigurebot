caption: Effect of citromycin on the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK)-1/2 signaling pathway in human ovarian cancer SKOV3 and A2780 cells
  were treated with citromycin for 48 h. The phosphorylated and total ERK1/2, JNK,
  p38, and AKT levels were analyzed by Western blotting. β-Actin was used as a loading
  control. Representative images of three independents are shown. Densitometric analysis
  of p-ERK and t-ERK levels are shown as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
  One-way ANOVA was used to identify statistically significant differences. * p <
  0.05 versus the control group.
