caption: Schematic representation of calcineurin signaling pathway in Aspergillus
  sp. Calmodulin is activated by calcium ions, which penetrate inside the cell through
  the high-affinity calcium influx system, consisting mainly of the Ccha and MidA
  calcium channels, the key access route for calcium in the cell when calcium levels
  are low. CchA, at least, is negatively regulated by calcineurin. The Ca2+–calmodulin
  complex activates calcineurin with its two subunits, catalytic (CnA) and regulatory
  (CnB). Calcineurin presents a serine–proline-rich region (SPRR); phosphorylating
  the four serine residues of SPRR, as well as phosphorylation of CnA C-terminus and
  CnB N-terminus, is necessary for calcineurin to exert its effects. Complexes of
  immunophilins with immunosuppressant molecules (FK506-binding protein with tacrolimus
  or cyclophilin A with cyclosporin) inhibit calcineurin. Activated (phosphorylated)
  calcineurin acts on its effector protein, CrzA (the zinc finger transcription factor
  Crz1 homolog), dephosphorylating it. Dephosphorylated Crza is translocated into
  the nucleus, where it activates the transcription of a number of genes, which encode
  proteins involved in cation homeostasis (rcnA, pmcA-pmcB), other proteins involved
  in stress response (sskB, hsp12), efflux proteins (mdr1, atrA, atrB, atrF, abcC,
  abcE), proteins responsible for cell wall integrity (chsA, fksA), proteins involved
  in regulating morphogenesis and in virulence (BAR, but also pmcA, sskB, etc.). As
  for many such diagrams, only the most relevant molecules and interactions are shown;
  in reality, the signaling network is more complex and currently only partially known.
