caption: Effect of TriL on PDGF-BB-stimulated VSMC migration by transwell assay. (A)
  Inhibition of TriL (5, 10, and 20 µM) in response to PDGF-BB-stimulated VSMC migration.
  (B) Statistical difference of TriL (5, 10, and 20 µM) in response to PDGF-BB stimulated
  VSMC migration at different TriL concentrations. The normal group was treated with
  vehicles. *** p < 0.001 compared with the PDGF-BB control treated group (n = 6).
