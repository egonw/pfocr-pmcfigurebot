caption: 'Effects of the IESL extracts on the expression of ERs and the PI3K/Akt pathway.
  Ovariectomy did not induce a significant change in the expression of ER α but decreased
  the expression of ER β (a). In the OVX+IESL group, the administration of IESL significantly
  increased both ERs compared to the OVX group. In the OVX group, expression of the
  PI3K and p-Akt/Akt ratio are significantly decreased compared with the CTL group,
  but the treatment of IESL restored them in the OVX+IESL group (b). Data are expressed
  as the mean ± S.E.M. * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 vs. the CTL group; # p < 0.05 and
  ## p < 0.01 vs. the OVX group.'
