caption: 'Angiogenesis pathway. The interaction between VEGF and VEGFR leads to the
  activation of downstream signaling which ultimately results in angiogenesis activation.
  Specific anti-angiogenic drugs such as bevacizumab, ramucirumab, aflibercept, and
  regorafenib block angiogenic cascade activation. Abbreviations: AKT/PKB: Protein
