caption: System schematics showing the inflation and deflation cycles. (a) Inflation
  cycle with red lines marking the airflow pathway and arrows showing the direction
  of flow. Both 3/2-way solenoid valves are off/de-energized during the inflation
  cycle, allowing the miniature air pump to transport air from the ambient atmosphere
  through the inflation chip to the air bladders within the lymphedema sleeve. (b)
  Deflation cycle with cyan lines marking the airflow pathway and arrows showing the
  direction of flow. Both 3/2-way solenoid valves are on/energized during the deflation
  cycle, allowing the miniature air pump to transport air from the air bladders within
  the lymphedema sleeve through the deflation chip to the ambient atmosphere. The
  pressure sensor in the system schematics provides feedback to control inflation
  and deflation cycles by measuring the pressure at the outlet of the miniature air
  pump.
