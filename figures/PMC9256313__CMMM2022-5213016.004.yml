caption: 'Effects of Afatinib on protein expressions of tumor markers. Effects of
  Afatinib on the occurrence of tumors detected by Western blotting. After treating
  NSCLC cells with three drugs, the difference between protein expressions of three
  tumor markers was compared. Experimental group: Afatinib group; control groups:
  DDP+PEM group and saline group; n = 5; ∗P < 0.05.'
