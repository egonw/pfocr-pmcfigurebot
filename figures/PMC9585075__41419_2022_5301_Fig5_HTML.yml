figure_title: Zymosan-A promoted the regeneration of ISCs via TLR2 signaling pathway
  and Wnt signaling pathway
caption: A Heatmap of DEGs between IR + PBS mice and IR + Zymosan-A mice. B Pathway
  enrichment analysis of KEGG. C GO term analysis was performed on DEGs. D C57BL/6
  mice and TLR2 KO mice were intraperitoneally injected with Zymosan-A (25.0 mg/kg)
  24 and 2 h before 8.5 Gy TBI, Control mice were treated with PBS. Survival was recorded.
  E The levels of IL-6 and GM-CSF in the serum of mice pretreated with Zymosan-A or
  PBS at 24 h after IR. F WB analysis of intestinal tissue proteins. G WB analysis
  of intestinal organoid proteins; H Representative images of intestinal organoids
  with ICG-001 (25.0 μM) treatment.The data were presented as mean ± SD. *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001 for control versus Zymosan-A treatment.
