caption: 'miR-146a-5p carried by EVs activates the Hippo-YAP pathway through targeting
  WWC2 to facilitate cervical cancer metastasis. (a) Western blot assay of WWC2 protein
  and the levels of LATS1 and YAP phosphorylation in C33A cells. (b) RT-qPCR determination
  of miR-146a-5p expression in C33A cells. (c) RT-qPCR determination of CTGF and Cyr61
  mRNA expression in C33A cells. (d) Immunofluorescence detection of YAP location
  in C33A cells. (e) RT-qPCR determination of miR-146a-5p in C33A cells. (f) Western
  blot assay of YAP, cofilin, p-cofilin, F-actin, and G-actin expression in C33A cells.
  (g) Phalloidin staining of the cytoskeleton of C33A cells, scale bar: 25 μm. (h)
  Transwell assay of the invasion and migration of C33A cells. (i) Adhesion of C33A
  cells to the extracellular matrix. (j) TUNEL staining of C33A cell apoptosis. (k)
  Western blot assay of the protein expression of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and Vimentin
  in C33A cells. (l) The in vivo fluorescence imaging of nude mice injected with 5 × 105
  stable luciferase-labeled C33A cells through tail vein, n = 8. (m) The metastatic
  nodes in the lunge of nude mice, n = 8. (n) Survival curve of nude mice, n = 8.
  The data in the figure were measurement data and expressed as mean ± standard deviation.
  The comparison among multiple groups was performed by a one-way analysis of variance
  (Dunnett''s post hoc test). ∗p < 0.05. Cell experiments were repeated 3 times independently.'
