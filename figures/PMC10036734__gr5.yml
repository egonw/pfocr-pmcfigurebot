caption: 'The pathways enriched in CRC tissues with high SLAMF8 expression were associated
  with the regulation of the tumor immune microenvironment.(A) SLAMF8 was expressed
  at a higher level in M1 macrophages than in M2 macrophages. KEGG pathway analysis
  was used to explore the pathways enriched in CRC tissues with high SLAMF8 expression:
  antigen processing and presentation (B), cytokineâ€’cytokine receptor interaction,
  (C) chemokine signaling pathway (D), Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis (E), and pathways
  in cancer (F).'
article_title: SLAMF8, a potential new immune checkpoint molecule, is associated with
  the prognosis of colorectal cancer.
