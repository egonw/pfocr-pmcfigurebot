caption: 'Baseline cross-disease correlation between disease activity and pathway
  activities. (a) Psoriasis related pathways are positively correlated with Mayo Scores
  of UC patients (lesional colon at baseline); Y axis indicates # of pathways/gene
  sets; X axis is correlation coefficient between pathway/gene set activity and UC
  disease activity as represented as Mayo Score. (b) Pathways dysregulated in UC related
  are positively correlated with disease scores (PASI) of psoriasis patients (lesional
  skin at baseline); Y axis indicates # of pathways/gene sets; X axis is correlation
  coefficient between pathway/gene set activity and psoriasis disease activity as
  represented as PASI.'
