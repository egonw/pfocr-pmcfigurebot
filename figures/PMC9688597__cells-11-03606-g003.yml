caption: Interfering with LTB4R inhibited the ability of ccRCC cells to migrate and
  invade, and EMT progression. (Aâ€“D) Knockdown of LTB4R inhibited the migration of
  Caki1 cells and ACHN cells. (E,F) Knockdown of LTB4R inhibited the invasion of Caki1
  and ACHN cells. (G) Western blot analysis showed that knockdown of LTB4R increased
  the epithelial phenotype E-cadherin and significantly decreased the mesenchymal
  phenotype (N-cadherin, Vimentin) in Caki1 and ACHN cells. A 2-tailed t test was
  used (** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001).
