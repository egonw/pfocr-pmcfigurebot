figure_title: Effect of the FZD4 Patient-Derived Variants on Norrin-FZD4 Signaling
caption: Different species of FZD4 were produced using transfection of variants in
  HEK293T cells, along with LRP5 and TSPAN12, with pathway activation measured after
  adding Norrin. A, All 3 variants display significant decreases in FZD4 pathway activation
  of Î²-catenin compared with wild type. The p.Met105Val and p.Met493_Trp494del variants
  show a marked decrease in functioning, whereas the p.Cys450X truncated variant fails
  to activate the pathway entirely. B, To determine the effects of the variant on
  wild type function, 2 different FZD4 species were simultaneously used in the FZD4
  signaling assay. When the p.Met105Val and p.Cys450X FZD4 variants were expressed
  together, there was a significant 4-fold decrease in FZD4 signaling. Expression
  of the parental p.Met105Val or p.Cys450X variant with wild type FZD4, as well as
  the known p.Met493_Trp494del dominant allele, did not significantly affect FZD4
  signaling. As inheriting 1 FZD4 variant in humans is known to cause FEVR with variable
  expressivity, the cell-based assay appears not to be sensitive enough to accurately
  predict even known FZD4 individual variant effects on disease severity when expressed
  in trans with wild type FZD4. C, Western blot assessing protein expression of each
  FZD4. The band corresponding to the p.Cys450X variant appears lower at 50 kDa as
  opposed to 59 kDa in wild type FZD4, owing to the introduction of the premature
  stop codon that reduces the protein size by 87 residues. The bands demonstrate that
  all proteins were successfully produced in each cell experiment thus validating
  the signaling assays results.
