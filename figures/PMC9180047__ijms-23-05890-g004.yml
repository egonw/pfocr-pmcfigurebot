caption: 'Morphological changes indicating the induction of vacuolating and apoptotic
  changes and a decrease in the dividing capacity of Hela cells as a consequence of
  48 h treatment with azelastine hydrochloride. (A1) Control cells with normal morphology,
  including interphase cells and cells with multiple mitotic figures. (A2–6a) Cells
  treated with azelastine at concentrations of 15–90 µM; (A2–3a) cells with numerous
  vacuolization changes in the cytoplasm, strongly eosinophilic material is visible
  within the vacuoles, which is destined for degradation, indicating the process of
  autophagy; (A4,4a) cells with intensive cytoplasmic vacuolization and a pyknotic
  cell nucleus with visible partial chromatin condensation; (5–6a) strong pro-apoptotic
  effect of azelastine at concentrations of 60 µM and 90 µM, expressed by the presence
  of numerous apoptotic cells and cells with efferocytosis. Explanation of markings:
  1—interphase, 2—prophase, 3—prometaphase, 4—metaphase, 5—telophase, 6—cytokinesis,
  7—vacuolization of cytoplasm, 8—vacuoles with visible digestion material, 9—apoptotic
  cells, 10—binucleated cells in apoptosis, 1—-binucleated cells with vacuolization,
  12—giant cells, 13—abnormal segregation of chromosomes, 14—multinucleated cells
  in apoptosis, 15—cells with features of vacuolization and apoptosis, 16—multinucleated
  cells with vacuolization, 17—efferocytosis, 18—cells with phagocytosed material
  (by efferocytosis), which were directed toward the apoptotic pathway. Hematoxylin
  and eosin staining. Images were taken at 4000× magnification. (B) Cell cycle changes
  of HeLa line cells treated for 48 h with azelastine at concentrations of 15–90 µM
  analyzed by flow cytometry. (C) Percentage of cells in different phases of the cell
  cycle indicating blocking of cells in S phase. (D) Azelastine concentration-dependent
  number of vacuolated and apoptotic cells; at concentrations of 15–25 µM, azelastine
  induced vacuolization changes; at a concentration of 45 µM, there was a reduction
  in vacuolization changes in favor of apoptotic cells, while at concentrations of
  60–90 µM, azelastine promoted apoptosis. (E) Changes in the mitotic index indicating
  an inhibition of the dividing capacity of azelastine. Average values from three
  independent experiments. The differences were statistically confirmed at: *** p
  < 0.001.'
