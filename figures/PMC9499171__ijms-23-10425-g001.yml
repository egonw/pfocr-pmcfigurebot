caption: 'Differential gene expression (DEGs) and pathway analysis of Serpina1 KO
  vs. WT. (a) Principal component analysis of samples selected for RNA-Seq data analysis
  and DEG exploration with WT labeled blue and KO labeled red. (b) Volcano plot of
  DEGs where x-axis represents the log2 fold _change and y-axis represents the significance
  level wherein p-values have been −log10 transformed. Significantly expressed genes
  are labeled blue (p-value ≤ 0.05), and non-significant genes are labeled in red.
  (c) A plot showing the KEGG pathways that were identified from DEGs between KO vs.
  WT mice using EnrichR. X-axis: odds ratio, Y-axis negative Log10 p-value. (d) Gene
  ontology analysis using EnrichR: x-axis: odds ratio, y-axis negative Log10 p-value.
  (e) Protein-protein interaction networks as generated with String-Db: Differentially
  expressed genes were subjected to k-means clustering (n = 6) with high confidence
  interaction settings.'
