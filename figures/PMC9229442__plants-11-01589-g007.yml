caption: A quantitative RT-PCR analysis of strawberry NPR3-like genes upon C. fructicola
  invasion in diploid ‘Hawaii4’ and octoploid ‘Benihoppe’. The same RNA samples in  were
  analyzed. The same primer pairs for all NPR3-like genes except for NPR32b were used
  in F. vesca ‘Hawaii4’ and F. × ananassa ‘Benihoppe’. FvePR10a (FvH4_4g19120) was
  used as a marker gene of SA-depending defense signaling pathway. The primers and
  corresponding target alleles amplified were shown in . The gene name followed with
  ‘-s’ indicates multiple alleles detected in ‘Benihoppe’. The relative transcript
  levels of NPR3-like genes were normalized with two reference genes EF1α and GAPDH2
  [] and reported as the mean of three biological replicates ± SE. The asterisks indicate
  significant differences based on a Student t-test analysis (*, p < 0.05).
