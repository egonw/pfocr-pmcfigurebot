caption: The effects of BRHE on IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and INFβ mRNA expression in RAW
  264.7 macrophages (A) and peritoneal macrophage (B). The cells were pre-treated
  with BRHE (200, 100, or 50 μg/mL) or LPS (0.5 μg/mL) for 6 h. Cellular mRNA expression
  analysis was determined using qPCR. IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and INFβ expression levels
  were calculated after normalizing the signal against the β-actin gene. Data are
  expressed as mean ± SD of three independent experiments. ** p < 0.01 versus control.
