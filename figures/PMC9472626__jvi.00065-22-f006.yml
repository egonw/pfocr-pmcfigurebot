caption: Immune responses in the brains of suckling mice. (A) Total RNA was extracted
  from the brains of 2- and 7-day-old virus- and mock-infected mice at 5 dpi and subjected
  to direct RNA-seq and pathway enrichment analysis. (B) Transcripts of genes encoding
  antiviral and proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were detected by RT-qPCR.
  Relative transcript levels of were calculated using the comparative threshold cycle
  (ΔΔCT) method. The experiment was conducted in duplicate, using three mice. The
  data represent the means and standard errors.
