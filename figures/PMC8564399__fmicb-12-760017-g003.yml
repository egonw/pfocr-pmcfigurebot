caption: Transcriptomic response of the assimilatory sulfate reduction pathway. (A)
  Genes and operons of the assimilatory sulfate reduction pathway. The underlined
  genes and operons were included in the two-way hierarchical clustering analysis.
  cysG was excluded from this analysis due to its different regulatory mechanism from
  all other genes in the sulfate reduction pathway. (B) The expression profiles of
  the sulfate reduction pathway follow the same trend as cysH and cysIJ. Two-way hierarchical
  clustering analysis for genes of the sulfate reduction pathway and their transcriptional
  regulator gene cysB. With the exceptions of cysB and sbp, all the cys genes in this
  pathway generally follow the same gene expression profiles as those of cysH and
  cysIJ across all the sample groups. (C) Average log2 fold-change of sulfate reduction
  gene expression levels in the TMP, ERY and TMP + ERY groups relative to the no-drug
  control group.
