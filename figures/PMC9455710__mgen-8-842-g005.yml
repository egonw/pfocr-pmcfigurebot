caption: 'Potential pathways and enzymes of bacterial polystyrene and styrene degradation.
  Initially, abiotic chemical and physical factors, and potentially also extracellular
  enzymes such as hydroxylases and dehydrogenases, attack the polystyrene polymer
  creating carbonyl groups. Next, extracellular enzymes such as serine hydrolase and
  triacylglycerol lipase degrade the polymer to styrene monomers. A putative transmembrane
  protein StyE/PorA can import styrene monomers into the cell, where it is degraded
  via the vinyl side chain oxygenation or the direct ring cleavage pathway. In the
  vinyl side chain oxygenation pathway, styrene is broken down to phenylacetate using
  enzymes of the styABCD operon: styrene monooxygenase (StyA/SMO), styrene monooxygenase
  reductase component (StyB), styrene oxide isomerase (StyC/SOI) and phenylacetadehyde
  dehydrogenase (StyD/PAD/FeaB/ TynC). Styrene can also form 2-phenylethylamines and
  2-phenylethanols as intermediates, through modifications of vinyl side chain pathway
  by the enzymes aminotransferase (AT), alanine dehydrogenase (alaDH) and alcohol
  dehydrogenase (ADH). The direct ring cleavage pathway converts styrene into Krebs
  cycle intermediates via meta cleavage breakdown or to muconic acid. Involved key
  enzymes are styrene dioxygenase (DO), 2,3-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase/cis glycol dehydrogenase
  (GDH), catechol-1,2-dioxygenase (C1,2DO) and catechol-2,3-dioxygenase (C2,3DO).
