caption: 'Cytoprotective role of CDDO-IM in response to LPS-induced cytotoxicity.
  LPS-induced cytotoxicity and cytoprotective effects of CDDO-IM against LPS toxicity.
  (a) The cells were treated with LPS as indicated concentrations for 24 h and the
  cell viability was measured by MTT assay. (b) The cells were pretreated with CDDO-IM
  at 400 nM for 24 h, followed by incubating the cells with LPS for another 24 h.
  Treatment of macrophages with LPS resulted in a significant decrease in cell viability.
  However, co-treatment with 400 nM CDDO-IM resulted in a significant increase in
  cell viability in macrophages treated with 200 ng/mL LPS. All data represent mean ± SEM
  (n = 3.*p < 0.05 vs control, #p < 0.05 vs LPS only). The differences between treatments
  were measured by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s post
  hoc test. (A color version of this figure is available in the online journal.)'
