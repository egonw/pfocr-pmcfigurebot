caption: KEGG pathway enrichment analysis bubble diagram. The top 20 metabolic pathways
  were selected (n = 8). (A) HFD vs. NC. (B) MSDF vs. HFD. (C) HSDF vs. HFD. The horizontal
  coordinate is the rich factor, calculated as several differential metabolites/total
  metabolites in each pathway. The size of the bubbles in the graph represents the
  number of metabolites enriched to the metabolic set in that pathway and the color
  of the bubbles indicates the size of different enrichment significance p-values.
