caption: 'IRE1α-dependent signaling in blood cancer cells: The increased expression
  of IRE1α and its major substrate XBP1 may be observed in various hematological malignancies,
  including AML, ALL, CML, CLL, ABC DLBCL, or MM. In most cases, activation of IRE1α–XBP1
  pathway results in enhanced proliferation and chemoresistance of cancer cells, while
  the rate of apoptosis is decreased, and patient survival is significantly poorer,
  compared with the mentioned tumor-non-expressing UPR-related proteins.'
