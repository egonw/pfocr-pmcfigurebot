caption: Effects of apigenin on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in cervical cancer
  cells. Proteins p-PI3K (p85), PI3K (p85), p-AKT, AKT, p-mTOR, and mTOR were detected
  in HeLa (A) and C33A (B) cells with or without 50 μM apigenin treatment for 24 h
  via Western blotting and quantified. Data are presented as the mean ± SD of at least
  three independent experiments. * p < 0.05 indicates a significant difference as
  compared with the corresponding control. CON, 0.1% DMSO; Api 50, 50 μM apigenin.
