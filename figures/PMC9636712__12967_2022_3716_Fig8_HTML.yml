caption: ACE2 is strongly positively correlated with breast cancer drug resistance
  genes (BRCA-DRGs). A The Venn diagram of common upregulated genes between four groups
  of drug-resistant cells and breast cancer drug-resistant genes defined by GeneCards.
  The barplot below Venn diagram shows the detailed number of each gene list. B Heatmap
  showing the correlation of genes expression in breast cancer drug resistance gene
  set. C The bubble plot summarizing the correlations between BRCA-DRGs and anticancer
  drugs. D Kaplan–Meier survival analysis of the signature (BRCA-DRGs) in TCGA-BRCA
  and (E) METABRIC databases. F Spearman correlation analysis of ACE2 expression and
  the signature (BRCA-DRGs). Scatter plot showed that the expression of ACE2 and the
  signature (BRCA-DRGs) was positively correlated in breast cancer drug-resistant
  cells (R = 0.858, P = 8.25e−08)
