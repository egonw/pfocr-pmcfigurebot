caption: KIF11 maintains the mRNA stability of WNT6, WNT7B and WNT8B. (A) Control
  and KIF11 knockdown HepG2 cells were used for mRNA sequencing. The expression profile
  was used for GSEA on the WNT signalling pathway. HepG2 cells were cultured in a
  serum‐free medium for 0 or 48 h, mRNA expression levels of WNTs were analysed by
  qPCR (B), while protein expression levels were detected by WB (C). Control and KIF11
  knockdown or overexpression HepG2 cells were used for qPCR (D) and WB (E) analysis.
  (F) Cell lysates of HepG2 cells were incubated with normal rabbit IgG or KIF11 antibody
  for RIP. The immunoprecipitates were analysed by real‐time RT‐PCR to examine the
  enrichment efficiency of WNTs mRNA. (G–I) HepG2 cells expressing control shRNA or
  KIF11 shRNA were treated with actinomycin D (1 mg/mL) for the indicated periods.
  Total RNA was then analysed by real‐time RT‐PCR to examine the mRNA half‐life of
  indicated mRNAs. (J) HepG2 cells were infected with lentiviruses expressing sh‐ctrl,
  sh‐WNT6, sh‐WNT7B or sh‐WNT8B. The protein lysates were subjected to WB analysis.
  (K) sh‐ctrl&ctrl, sh‐KIF11&ctrl or sh‐KIF11&WNT6/7B/8B HepG2 cells were used for
  WB analysis with indicated antibodies. Data shown are the mean ± SD (n ≥ 3; *p < .05,
  **p < .01, ***p < .001, two‐tailed t‐test).
