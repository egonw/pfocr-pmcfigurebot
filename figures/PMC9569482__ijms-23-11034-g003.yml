caption: Neomycin is the only protein synthesis inhibitor that activates the CWI pathway.
  (a) Halo sensitivity assay of vector (WT) or Y3656 strains with integrated IPAC.
  Disks were impregnated with 100 mg/mL of neomycin sulfate, 1 mg/mL of cycloheximide,
  50 mg/mL of G418, 50 mg/mL of hygromycin B, or 50 mg/mL of gentamycin. Mean and
  standard deviations of halo diameters from three different experiments are shown.
  (b) Western blotting analysis of extracts from Y3656 strain without (−) or with
  IPAC (+) and treated or not (no stress) for 4 h with 10 mg/mL neomycin, 25 μg/mL
  cycloheximide, 31.3 μg/mL G418, 62.5 μg/mL hygromycin B, or 10 mg/mL gentamycin
  sulfate. Dually phosphorylated Slt2, total Slt2 protein, and G6PDH (as a loading
  control) were detected with anti-phospho-p44/42, anti-Slt2, and anti-G6PDH antibodies,
  respectively. A representative blot from three independent experiments is shown.
