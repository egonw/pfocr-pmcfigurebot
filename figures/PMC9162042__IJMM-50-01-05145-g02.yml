caption: Upstream regulators of 53BP1 in NHEJ repair. (A) In a stress-free environment,
  TIRR inhibits the histone binding function of 53BP1 by binding to its Tudor domain,
  which is known as the 'off switch'. However, upon DNA damage, 53BP1 is recruited
  to chromatin and promotes DSB NHEJ repair, which is known as the 'on switch'. (B)
  At DSB ends, the assembly of phosphorylated DNA-PKcs serves as a platform to recruit
  Artemis, 53BP1 and other NHEJ factors. Post-transcriptional modification of DNA-PKcs
  affects its ability to promote NHEJ repair. The autophosphorylation or MEK5-dependent
  phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs contributes to 53BP1 recruitment, and induces DSB-induced
  microtubule dynamics stress response. The CRL4ADTL-induced ubiquitination degradation
  of DNA-PKcs inhibits the NHEJ repair. (C) The cell cycle phase is an important determinant
  of the repair pathway selection at DSB sites. In the G1 phase, the phosphorylation
  of Chk1 (S317, S345), regulated by ATM and ATR, induces the formation of 53BP1 foci
  following DNA damage. In the S/G2 phase, the recruitment of 53BP1 is inhibited by
  the phosphorylation of Chk1 (S59), FOXK1, BRCA1 and acetylated LMNB1 (K134). DSB,
