caption: Toll-like receptor signaling pathway is activated after HLJD treatment. (A)
  RNA-seq analysis was performed and the volcano plot was demonstrated. (n = 3 mice/group)
  (B) Interaction net of the significant pathways (Path-Net) of differentially signaling
  pathways. (C) Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze the expression levels of
  TLR7 (400×). HLJD = Huang Lian Jie Du Decoction, ICIs = anti-PD-1 + anti-CTLA-4
article_title: Huang Lian Jie Du Decoction enhances the anti-tumor efficacy of immune
  checkpoint inhibitors by activating TLR7/8 signalling in melanoma.
