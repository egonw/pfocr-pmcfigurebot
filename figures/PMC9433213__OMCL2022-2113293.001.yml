caption: 'The curcumin effects on body weight, ovarian weight, and abdominal fat in
  DHEA-induced PCOS-like rats. PCOS-like rats were induced with DHEA-exposed, together
  with or without curcumin treatment. (a, b) Rat body weight and ovarian weight were
  measured in all experimental groups after 8 weeks of curcumin treatment. (c) A macroscopic
  view of the abdominal fat of each group of rats was shown. (d, e) Abdominal fat
  in all experimental group rats was assessed by H&E staining (20x) and the quantitative
  analysis. Three independent experiments were performed with similar results. Data
  are shown as the mean ± SEM. ∗∗p < 0.05 vs. control group; ##p < 0.05 vs. PCOS group.'
