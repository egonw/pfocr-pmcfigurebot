caption: 'SH2 containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP2) in insulin signaling:
  At the cellular level, SHP2 plays a negative role in insulin metabolic pathway by
  dephosphorylating phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-binding sites (in yellow) and
  through RAS/Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK)-dependent inhibitory phosphorylation
  (in red). This results in the downregulation of insulin-dependent glucose uptake
  and storage, and the increase of glucose production, notably in the liver, all contributing
  to hyperglycemia. In addition, SHP2 promotes a proinflammatory M1 state in macrophages,
  which triggers inflammation-dependent insulin resistance. On the other side, SHP2
  has protective effects against insulin resistance by (i) promoting insulin biosynthesis
  in pancreas, (ii) regulating the development and function of adipose tissue, and
  (iii) stimulating central, leptin-dependent, energy expenditure. DAG: diacylglycerol,
  FFA: free fatty acid, InsR: insulin receptor. Created with BioRender.com accessed
