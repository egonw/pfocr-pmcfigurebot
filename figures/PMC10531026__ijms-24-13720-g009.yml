caption: 'Arabidopsis gene expression altered by BsCP1 and BsPG1. Changes in gene
  expression were detected via qPCR analysis using total RNA prepared from whole seedlings
  treated with BsCP1 and BsPG1. Genes associated with various pathways were investigated,
  including (A) SA signaling pathway: isochorismate synthase 1 (ICS1), enhanced disease
  susceptibility 1 (EDS1), and CAM-binding protein 60-like G (CBP60G). (B) JA signaling
  pathway: oxophytodienoate-reducatase 3 (OPR3), lipoxygenase 1 (LOX1), and MYC2.
  (C) ABA signaling pathway: short-chain dehydrogenase reductase 4 (SDR4), nine-cis-epoxycarotenoid
  dioxygenase 3 (NCED3), and ABA insensitive 5 (ABI5). (D) Abiotic stress response:
  DREB2A, ZAT12, ascorbate peroxidase 1 (APX1), glutathione peroxidase 7 (GPX7), delta-pyrroline-5-carboxylate
  synthase 1 (P5CS1), and chlorophyll a/b binding protein 1Â (CAB1). (E) Disease resistance:
  flg22-induced receptor-like kinase 1 (FRK1), pathogenesis-related (PR) protein 1
  (PR-1), PR-2, PR-3, and thionin 2.1 (Thi2.1). (F) Root development: nitrilase 2
  (NIT2) and NADPH oxidase/respiratory burst oxidase homolog C (RBOHC).'
