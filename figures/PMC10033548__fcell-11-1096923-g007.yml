caption: The suggested mechanism by which the loss of SFRP1 expression in epithelial
  cells linked with the stromal SFRP1 signalling axis promotes the stemness of prostate
  cancer cells and reduces their sensitivity to bicalutamide. SFRP1 induces higher
  SOX2, OCT4, and NANOG expression levels, all within the context of WNT/β-catenin
  pathway activation.
