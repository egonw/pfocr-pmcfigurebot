figure_title: Withdrawal induces whole transcriptomic changes in mPFCCRF1+ neurons
caption: 'A Schematic of isolation of mPFCCRF1+ neurons using fluorescence activated
  cell sorting from naïve and withdrawn mice for whole transcriptomic analysis. B
  Volcano plot of average log fold change plotted against the log of the adjusted
  p-value for expressed genes. Significantly (p < 0.05) upregulated and downregulated
  genes in withdrawn mice compared to naive are represented in red and blue, respectively.
  N = 5–6 male mice. C Top ten most significantly impacted pathways based on the differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs). Log fold change in the DEGs included in the PI3K-AKT signaling
  pathway where CSF1 is highlighted in yellow (inset). D Network analysis depicting
  interactions between DEGs. E Top ten gene ontology (GO) terms overrepresented among
  DEGs in three domains including: biological processes, molecular function, and cellular
  components. CSF1 is included in yellow highlighted GO terms.'
