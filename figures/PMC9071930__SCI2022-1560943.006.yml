caption: 'In vitro experimental further verifies the effects of palovarotene and Smad
  and NF-κB signaling pathways in HO. In immunohistochemistry, the positive rate of
  inflammation such as TNF-α, TGF-β, IFN-γ, IL-1β, and MMP-9 was increased (a), as
  well as p65, ID1, p-SMAD1/5, and osteogenic genes, concluding OCN and SOX9 (b).
  Scale bar = 25 μm. (c) Immunofluorescence and quantitative analysis against Smad5.
  Scale bar = 25 μm. Data are means ± SD (n = 3) ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01. #p < 0.05
  and ##p < 0.01. (d) The mRNA expression, Western blot analysis of tendon tissues,
  and relevant quantitative analysis of p65, ID1, OCN, and SOX9. Data are means ±
  SD (n = 3). ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01. #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01.'
