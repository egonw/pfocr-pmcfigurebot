caption: RNA seq analyses of gcAdarKO granulosa cells. (A) Volcano plot showing DEGs
  with fold change ≥1.5, FDR ≤ 0.1, between WT versus gcAdarKO granulosa cells 46
  h after eCG injection. Each dot represents a gene. Total there are only 55 upregulated
  genes. (B) Volcano plot showing DEGs with fold change ≥1.5, FDRP ≤ 0.1, between
  WT versus gcAdarKO granulosa cells 4h after hCG injection in eCG primed mice. Each
  dot represents a gene. (C) Venn diagram comparing differentially expressed genes
  (DEGs) between WT versus gcAdarKO GCs 46 h after eCG injection and 4 h after hCG
  injection in eCG primed mice. (D) Venn diagram comparing DEGs 46 h after eCG versus
  4 h after hCG injection in eCG primed mice in WT and gcAdarKO. (E–G) IPA analysis
  revealed three major pathways related to ovarian physiology. (E) Inflammation pathway,
  all genes were highly upregulated in gcAdarKO mice granulosa cells. * Denotes significant
  upregulated genes (p < 0.05). (F) progesterone and (G) estradiol downstream signaling
  pathways were identified and all of these genes were slightly downregulated.
