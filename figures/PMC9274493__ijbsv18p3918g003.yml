caption: 'Low expression of DDX3 promoted CRC cell migration and invasion in vitro.
  (A) Adhesion, migration and invasion assays in DDX3-KD SW480 and HCT116 cells and
  the assays in DDX3-OE DLD-1 cells (upper panel). The Relative cell numbers are analyzed
  in the lower panel. (B) Wound healing assay in DDX3-KD SW480 and HCT116 cells and
  the assay in DDX3-OE DLD-1 cells (upper panel). The closure rates of all wounds
  at 24 h and 48 h were analyzed and displayed in the lower panel. **P<0.01, ***P<0.001
  via Student''s t-test. All graphs are drawn from the mean ± SD of three independent
  replicates. Abbreviation: CRC, colorectal cancer; EV, empty vector; KD, knockdown;
  NC, negative control; OE, overexpression.'
