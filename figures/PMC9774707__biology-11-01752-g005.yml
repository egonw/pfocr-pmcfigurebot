caption: Sub-network of the signature genes and their functional enrichment identified
  through the LASSO. (A) Interaction network of genes identified through transcriptome–interactome
  signatures and their first neighbors. The genes are represented as red nodes, while
  their first neighbors are shown in green. (B) Functional enrichment analysis of
  17 targets against the pathway database KEGG and biological process in the Gene
  Ontology database.
