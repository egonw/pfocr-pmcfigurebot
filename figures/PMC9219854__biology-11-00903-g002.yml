caption: The sialic acid metabolic pathway. The schematic shows the different enzymes
  involved and each stepâ€™s respective localization. Feedback inhibition by CMP-Neu5Ac
  on GNE is also shown. The CMAH that biosynthesizes Neu5Gc is highlighted in green
  (CMAH). The pathway is modified from the REACTOME sialic metabolic pathway []. Created
