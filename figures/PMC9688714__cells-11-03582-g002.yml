caption: RNA editing occurs at microglial transcripts involved in differential signaling
  under normal (naïve) and EAE (pre-clinical, clinical) conditions. Visualization
  of pathway analysis (KEGG 2019 mouse database, through Enrichr, https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/
  (accessed on 20 September 2017)) performed on edited targets at each time-point.
  The graph provides the enrichment (-log10(p-value)) of the top 10 pathways identified
  per condition (ranked based on p-value). Three pathways (‘Osteoclast differentiation’,
  ‘Chagas disease’, ‘Lysosome’) are commonly identified in all three conditions. Among
  these, the pathway ‘Lysosome’ is over-represented in clinical disease. Microglia
  response signaling pathways are enriched in pre-clinical disease, while in clinical
  disease, the pathways ‘Antigen processing and presentation’ and ‘Phagosome’ are
  also enriched. For detailed illustrations of the 60 most enriched RNA-edited transcripts
  in corresponding pathways and time-points, refer to . Editing events occurring at
  intergenic regions were not included in this pathway analysis.
