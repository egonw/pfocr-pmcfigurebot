figure_title: Effects of AS-A2 on osteoclast-related gene expression. RAW264.7 cells
  were cultured in the presence or absence of RANKL (50 ng/mL) with AS-A2 (0 to10
  μM), and the grown medium was changed on alternate days for six days. (A) TRAP,
  cathepsin K, MMP-2, MMP-9, NFATc1, c-Fos, and RANK genes mRNA expression were evaluated
  using RT- PCR. (B) The computable band solidity of the genes was adjusted to that
  of β-actin. The data are based on three unrelated experiments
