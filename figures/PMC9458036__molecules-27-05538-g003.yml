caption: RES decreased accumulation of ROS and HIF-1α in BMSCs under hypoxia. (A,B)
  The level of ROS in BMSCs from control group, hypoxia group, L-RES group and H-RES
  group was detected and quantified. The content of (C) MDA and the activity of (D)
  CAT, (E) SOD, (F) T-AOC in BMSCs from control group, hypoxia group, L-RES group
  and H-RES group were determined. (G) The protein expression level of HIF-1α and
  PHD2 in BMSCs from control group, hypoxia group, L-RES group and H-RES group was
  determined and (H,I) quantified. Values were expressed as mean ± SD. * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01; all the assays were repeated more than three times.
