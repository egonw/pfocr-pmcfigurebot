caption: 'The effect of HIF-1α on LPS-induced epithelial model damage to Caco-2 cells
  is regulated by the mTOR/P70S6K pathway. (A) Rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor) decreased
  TEER of Caco-2 cell monolayer, and MHY1487 (mTOR activator) increased TEER of Caco-2
  cell monolayer. DMOG (HIF-1α activator) can rescue the decrease of TEER caused by
  rapamycin, and BAY87-2243 (HIF-1α inhibitor) can rescue the increase of TEER caused
  by MHY1487; (B) Rapamycin increased the FD4 concentration in Caco-2 cell monolayer,
  while MHY1487 had opposite effect. DMOG rescued the increase in FD4 concentration
  caused by rapamycin, and BAY 87-2243 rescued the decrease in FD4 concentration caused
  by MHY1487; (C) Western blot was used to detect the expression of p-mTOR, mTOR,
  p-P70S6K, P70S6K, HIF-1α and TJs (ZO-1, occludin and claudin-1)Con: control group,
