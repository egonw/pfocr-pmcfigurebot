caption: Diagram showing the effect of MOLP on DSS-induced UC. MOLP alleviated colonic
  pathological alterations, decreased goblet cells, crypt destruction, and infiltration
  of inflammatory cells caused by DSS (A), and decreased the histological score (B).
  MOLP repressed the loss of ZO-1 and occludin proteins in mucosal layer. MOLP suppressed
  TNF-α, IL-1β, and HMGB1 production. MOLP increased the mRNA expression of IL-10
  and PPAR-γ, and decreased the activation of MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway.
