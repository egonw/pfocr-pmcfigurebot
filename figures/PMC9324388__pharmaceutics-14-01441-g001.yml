caption: 'Intra-Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Cortical Biodistribution Data. The parent
  IgG1 antibody penetrated the brain parenchyma within 30 min of administration into
  the rat cisterna magna. Representative images. (a) Within 15 min post-injection,
  at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg, intra-CSF administered ABT-806 could only be seen along
  the periarteriolar spaces with no tissue penetration. After 30 min, the parent antibody
  started penetrating the brain parenchyma via the periarteriolar spaces. More penetration
  was observed after 45 min and 60 min of administration with ABT-806 starting to
  clear out of the parenchyma via the perivenular spaces. The parent antibody continued
  to enter the parenchyma even after 4 h post-injection. After 24 h, ABT-806 was still
  present in the tissue. Blue = 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), Red = ABT-806.
  (b) Quantification of the fluorescence intensity in the parenchyma but excluding
  the vasculature, indicates highest antibody concentrations at 1 h post-injection.
  0.5 h: 14,437 ± 2655; 1 h: 23,750 ± 4280; 4 h: 20,063 ± 3635; 24 h: 17,245 ± 2514.
  p > 0.05. n = 3 animals per timepoint, average of 20–25 slices per animal per timepoint.'
