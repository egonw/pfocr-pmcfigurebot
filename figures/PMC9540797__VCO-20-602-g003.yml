caption: Selecting the lead antibody candidate. PBMC were incubated with hybridoma
  supernatants before identifying proliferating CFSE+CD21+ B cells. Gating started
  with time, debris exclusion and single cell selection, leaving viable CD21+ B cells
  (A). CFSE binds intracellular proteins and dilutes by 50% with each division. Cells
  in the brightest peak in the histogram are undivided parental cells, cells in the
  second peak have divided once, those in the third peak have divided twice, and so
  forth. CFSE+ B cells proliferating in response to selected hybridomas shown as grey
  overlayed on clear unstimulated control histograms (B). The percentage of dividing
  cells responding to hybridomas (n = 1/2 dogs) (C). The lead hybridoma was titrated,
  shown as representative histograms in one dog (D), and graphically in three dogs
  (E). PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell
