caption: RNA sequencing analysis of SKOV3 cells treated with NaALN or CaALN. Volcano
  plots for all the expressed genes of control versus A) NaALN and B) CaALN treatments.
  Red (upregulated) and green (downregulated) dots mean that the genes have significant
  differences (FDR ≤ 0.001, and at least with twofold differences). C) Heat map of
  differentially expressed genes related to intracellular Fe‐deficiency. D,E) The
  top 10 remarkably enriched pathway of upregulated and downregulated of differentially
  expressed genes by KEGG analysis. GSEA enrichment plots of differentially expressed
  genes centralized in F) regulation of DNA replication, G) cell cycle, and H) TNF
  signaling pathway. I) Schematic illustration of anticancer mechanism of CaALN in
  SKOV3 cells.
