caption: Weighted set coverage of Ace2 pathways between females and males. Each Biological
  Process, Cellular Component and Molecular Function category is represented by a
  red, blue and green bar, respectively. The height of the bar represents the number
  of IDs in the functional category and. (A) Numbers of genes involve different pathways
  of Ace2 in the female. (B) Numbers of genes involve different pathways of Ace2 in
  the male. (C). pathway network of Ace2 in the female. (D). pathway network of Ace2
  in the male.
