figure_title: Mint-flavored JUUL aerosol exposures during pregnancy cause oxidant/antioxidant
  imbalances in the uterine/placental environment
caption: A) Mint-flavored JUUL aerosol exposures slightly decreased the placental
  11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2 (HSD2) enzyme expression in the placenta.
  HSD2 protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry techniques; images
  of placental tissue with HSD2 antibody (20x magnification). B) Quantification of
  the positively stained cells for HSD2. N=4 per group. Data are expressed as mean
  Â± SEM. C) Exposure to JUUL throughout gestation dysregulates the expression of uteri/placenta
  genes related to oxidative stress and hypoxia in dams. Gene expression of mice exposed
  to JUUL during pregnancy was normalized using gene expression results from the uterine/placental
  tissue of dams exposed only to HEPA-filtered air. Data expressed as fold-change
  compared to air control. N = 4 per group. Genes with at least a 1.5-fold up- or
  down-regulation were considered to have significant differences of expression compared
  with controls. D) The gene interaction networks altered by in utero JUUL exposure
  are correlated with multitude pathways that affect pregnancy outcomes. Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis (IPA) of dysregulated genes in dams exposed to JUUL throughout
  pregnancy revealed that those dams exhibited dysregulation of genes associated with
  vasoconstriction of blood vessel, morphology of placenta, disease of placenta, and
  disorder of pregnancy, compared to the uterine/placental tissue of dams exposed
  only to HEPA-filtered air throughout pregnancy.
