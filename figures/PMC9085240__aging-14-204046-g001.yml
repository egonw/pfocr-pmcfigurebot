caption: 'CD36 positively regulates DEK to promote migration and invasion in GC cells.
  (A) Heatmap of log2-fold gene expression changes in SNU-216 cells transfected with
  NC/siCD36. (B) Enrichment of genes within the Myc-targets-V1 pathway in the CD36-down-regulated
  Hallmark gene set. (C) Venn diagram of candidate genes downstream of CD36 obtained
  from combined mRNA array and MSigDB Hallmark-GSEA analyses. (D) Results of Transwell
  migration and invasion assays conducted on SNU-216 cells transfected with NC/siDEK.
  (E) Results of Transwell migration and invasion assays carried out in SNU-216 cells
  transfected with NC/siCD36/siCD36 + pcDNA3.1-DEK. (F) Western blot analysis of EMT
  and GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling markers in SNU-216 cells transfected with NC/siCD36/siCD36
  + pcDNA3.1-DEK. Data are presented as the mean ± SD. For D-F, *p < 0.05 vs. NC group;
  #p < 0.05 vs. siCD36 + pcDNA3.1-DEK group. GAPDH was used as endogenous control.'
