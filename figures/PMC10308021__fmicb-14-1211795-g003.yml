caption: 'Transcriptome-based analysis of genes involved in pigment synthesis. (A)
  PCA analysis, the more similar the sample composition is, the closer the distance
  in the PCA plot. (B) Correlation heat map: repeatability between repeated samples
  can be investigated. (C) DEG distribution in each sample, red represents upregulation
  and green represents downregulation. (D) Venn diagram of differential genes during
  the three development periods of purple and white strains. (E) Venn diagram of targeted
  genes. (F) KEGG enrichment bubble diagram. The red boxes represent the pathways
  associated with predicted pigment synthesis. (G) GESA enrichment ES curves. The
  gene enriched when ES reached the highest score is the major gene of the pathway.'
