caption: 'Effect of insulin, liraglutide and combined drugs on neuronal apoptosis
  in diabetic mice. (A) Relative mRNA expression levels of apoptosis-related genes
  were detected via reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. (B and C) Relative protein
  expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins were detected via western blotting.
  (D and E) Apoptosis of neurons in the cortex was detected using the TUNEL assay.
  Scale bar, 200 µm. β-actin was included as a reference for normalization. Data are
  presented as the mean ± SD (n=4/group). *P<0.05 vs. NGT; #P<0.05 vs. STZ. STZ, saline
  treated type 1 diabetes group; INS, insulin treatment group; LRG, liraglutide treatment
  group; INS + LRG, insulin and liraglutide treatment group; NGT, normal glucose tolerance
  group.'
