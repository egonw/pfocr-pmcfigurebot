caption: IPAM showed good performance in cancer classification and identification
  of pathway dysregulation. Panel a-c shows the average ROC-AUCs of each pathway activity
  algorithm in cancer classification using pan-cancer data. Our individualized pathway
  activity algorithm and five widely used tools (iPAS, Pathifier, PLAGE, ssGSEA and
  IndividPath) were compared. Each box in boxplots was built on the average ROC-AUCs
  of five-fold cross-validation for 100 random repeats across the different cancer
  data sets. The significance tests of ROC-AUCs between IPAM and other pathway activity
  algorithms were conducted using Student's t-test. (a) Boxplot of average ROC-AUCs
  for different pathway activity algorithms on cancer classification using pan-cancer
  data from TCGA. IPAM-withoutRank denotes the performance of cancer classification
  using IPAM algorithm without the gene ranking step. Gene-based denotes the performance
  of cancer classification using marker-gene selection. IPAM-corrected denotes the
  performance of IPAM algorithm in cancer classification using tumour purity corrected
  transcriptome data. (b) Boxplot of average ROC-AUCs for different pathway activity
  algorithms on cancer classification using pan-cancer data from GEO. (c) Boxplot
  of average ROC-AUCs for different pathway activity algorithms on cancer classification
  using liquid biopsy data based on tumour-educated platelets. (d) The number of significantly
  dysregulated pathways among cancer types. (e) The number of pathways that were significantly
  dysregulated in a specific number of cancer types. (f) The significantly dysregulated
  pathways among most cancer types. (g) Heatmap of 318 KEGG pathways dysregulation
  in pan-cancer. Data are showed by the t statistics of differential analyses between
  cancer samples and matched normal samples. The red colour represent that the pathway
  is up-regulated in the cancer samples, while blue colour is down-regulated. The
  intensity of colour indicates the magnitude of dysregulation.
