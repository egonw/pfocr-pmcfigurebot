caption: 'A working model of distinct mechanisms of APE1 in the ATR DNA damage response.
  (A) Stress conditions (canonical function): APE1 promotes the ATR–Chk1 DDR pathway
  activation via its AP endonuclease and exonuclease activities under stress conditions,
  which is considered as canonical function of APE1. (B) Unperturbed conditions (non-canonical
  function): under unperturbed conditions, APE1 overexpression leads to biomolecular
  condensates (liquid–liquid phase separation) in nucleoli in vivo and in nuclear
  extracts in vitro via its N33 motif and/or W119 residue in AAD domain. ATR/ATRIP,
  TopBP1, and ETAA1 are recruited to the APE1-induced condensates for ATR activation.
  APE1-induced nucleolar ATR DDR suppresses rRNA transcription, arrests cell cycle,
  elevates DNA damage, and reduces cell viability. See text for more details.'
