caption: Activation of the NFκB signaling pathway by FnEDA in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer
  cells is TLR5-dependent. MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells were incubated with a TLR5
  neutralizing antibody (anti-TLR5; 2 µg/mL) for 1 h prior to treatment with either
  FnEDA (5 µM), FnIII-1c (10 µM), or flagellin (FLA, 50 ng/mL) for 1 h. Cell layers
  were then rinsed and whole-cell lysates analyzed by WES. Representative Wes-ProteinSimple
  assay for (A) phosphorylated p65 NFκB (p-p65 NFκB), (B) phosphorylated IKKα/β (pIKKα/β),
  and (C) phosphorylated TAK1 (pTAK1) are shown. Western analyses shown in (A–C) were
  quantified and normalized to GAPDH expression (D–F, respectively). Data represent
  the mean ± SEM of three independent determinations. NT indicates no treatment. *
  p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; Student’s t-test.
