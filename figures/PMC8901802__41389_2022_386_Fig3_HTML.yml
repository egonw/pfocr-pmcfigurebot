figure_title: PSMC2 activated mTOR pathway by upregulating RPS15A
caption: A IPA was employed to map the interaction network between molecules and pathways
  significantly related to PSMC2. B qPCR was conducted to measure the levels of PSMC2
  and RPS15A mRNA in MGC-803 cells after PSMC2 overexpression or knockdown. C WB was
  performed to measure the levels of PSMC2 and RPS15A proteins in MGC-803 cells after
  PSMC2 overexpression or knockdown. D Immumohistochemical staining was conducted
  to evaluate the expression of RPS15A in the gastric cancer tissues and para-carcinoma
  tissues. E WB was employed to detect the expression of mTOR pathway-related proteins
  after PSMC2 knockdown. F The expression of mTOR pathway-related proteins in MGC-803
  cells with RPS15A overexpression or RPS15A overexpression and PSMC2 knockdown. *P < 0.05,
  ***P < 0.001, compared with Control group. Error bars meant SD.
