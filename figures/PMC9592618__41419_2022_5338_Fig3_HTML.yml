figure_title: Integrin β1 recycling is essential for KIF15 promoting FA turnover and
  metastasis in PC cells
caption: A The co-localization of Integrin β1 with early endosome (Rab5), recycling
  endosome (Rab11), and late endosome (Rab7) markers was analyzed by immunofluorescence.
  B Cycloheximide (CHX, 50 μg/ml) was used to treat Vector, KIF15-overexpressed PC
  cells for 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h. Integrin β1 expression was examined by western blotting.
  Relative levels of integrin β1 were quantified by scanning densitometry and normalized
  to the level of GAPDH. C Western blot analysis of FAK pathway activity in KIF15-overexpressed
  PC cells that treated with endosome trafficking inhibitor Dynasore or RAB11 siRNA.
  D Western blot analysis of p-FAK-397 after nacodazole washout in indicated cells.
  The KIF15-overexpressed PC Cells were treated with endosome trafficking inhibitor
  Dynasore or RAB11 siRNA. E Immunofluorescence analysis of the focal adhesions disassembly
  in indicated cells. All data represent means ± SEM; ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01; *P < 0.05;
  two-tailed Student’s t test.
