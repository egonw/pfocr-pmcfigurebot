caption: Production and fate of NO. The major enzymatic pathway for NO synthesis is
  catalyzed by NOS isoforms in the presence of O2. Once produced, NO can be rapidly
  converted to nitrite with dissolved O2 by NO scavenging reactions, or can be inactivated
  to nitrate by oxygenated heme proteins. When de novo production via NOS is compromised
  under low O2, NO can be produced by the reduction nitrite in heme proteins, or by
  nitrate conversion to nitrite by xanthine oxidoreductase. NO signaling occurs by
  binding to (i) sGC promoting the canonical cGMP cascade, or (ii) heme-containing
  proteins, thiols, or amines, forming iron-nitrosyl (FeNO), S-nitroso (SNO) and N-nitroso
  (NNO) compounds promoting protein post-translational modifications. Excess NO can
  react with superoxide to form peroxynitrite (ONOOâˆ’), which in turn can react with
  lipids, DNA, protein thiols, and oxidize cysteine residues.
