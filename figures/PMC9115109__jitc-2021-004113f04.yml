caption: SNORA38B promoted IL-10 secretion in NSCLC cells. (A) The mRNA level of cytokines
  in NSCLC cells and normal lung cells using qRT-PCR. The expression differences are
  shown by fold change (FC) in different colors. (B–C) Relative IL-10 level in the
  supernatant of human or mouse NSCLC cells and normal lung cells using ELISA. Human/mouse
  normal lung cell Beas-2B and MLE-12 were used as control. (D) Relative IL-10 level
  in the supernatant of A549 and H1975 cells transfected with SNORA38B KO, SNORA38B
  OE or its counterparts using ELISA. (E) Relative IL-10 mRNA level in A549 and H1975
  cells transfected with SNORA38B KO, SNORA38B OE or its counterparts using qRT-PCR.
  Assays were conducted in triple. *p<0.05, **p<0.01., ***p<0.001., ****p<0.001, means±SD
  was shown. Statistical analysis was subjected to Student’s t-test and one-way analysis
  of variance. IL, interleukin; KO, knockout; mRNA, messenger RNA; NSCLC, non-small
  cell lung cancer; OE, overexpress; qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time PCR; SNORNA,
  small nucleolar RNA; TGF, transforming growth factor; TNF, tumor necrosis factor;
  FC, fold change; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

  blockade in non-small cell lung cancer by remodeling the tumor microenvironment
  via regulation of GAB2/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
