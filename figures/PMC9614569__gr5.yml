caption: 'ERK1/2 signaling pathway involves in the regulation of BNIP3-autophagy axis
  under hypoxia. CFPAC-1 cells were subjected to hypoxia for 12, 24 and 48 h and then
  ERK1/2 activity was detected with Western blot (n = 3). β-Actin was used as a loading
  control. (B) The graph represents the means ± SEM of the relative integrated signals.
  (C) As a specific inhibitor of ERK1/2 signaling, PD98058 (work concentration: 10
  μM) was used to suppress the activation of ERK1/2 signaling. Western blot was performed
  to detect the expressions of LC3-II and BNIP3 upon ERK1/2 inhibition in CFPAC-1
  cells under hypoxia. (D) The graph represents the means ± SEM of the relative integrated
  signals. (E, F) Fluorescence staining of BNIP3 (red) and LC3 (green) was performed
  in the indicated CFPAC-1 cells (n = 3). Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Scale bar
  = 25 μm. (G) Representative images of autophagosomes (yellow, GFP+ mRFP+ puncta)
  and autolysosomes (red, GFP− mRFP+ puncta) in the indicated groups. Nuclei were
  stained with DAPI (n = 3). Scale bar = 25 μm. (H) Effects of ERK1/2 inhibition on
  cell proliferation was determined with EdU staining (green) (n = 3). Nuclei were
  stained with DAPI (blue). Graph quantifying the number of EdU-positive cells was
  shown in the right pannel. (I) CCK-8 assay was further performed to test the cell
  proliferation and the results were presented as the means ± SEM. (J) Single cell
  motility assays were performed to detect the motility of indicated CFPAC-1 (n =
  3). (K) Graph quantifying the average velocity of cell movement. Results were shown
  as means ± SEM, as shown in the right pannel. (L) Scratch wound healing assays were
  performed to detect the migration of indicated cells (n = 3). Representative pictures
  of the scratched wound were shown. Scale bar = 100 μm. (M) Graph quantifying the
  rate of wound closure was demonstrated as means ± SEM. ∗P < 0.05 vs. Norm group,
  #P < 0.05 vs. Hypo group. All the experiments were repeated 3 times.'
