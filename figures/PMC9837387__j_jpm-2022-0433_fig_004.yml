caption: Perturbed biological pathways in the four preeclampsia clusters relative
  to controls. Perturbed KEGG pathways were revealed by iPathway Guide based on differentially
  abundant proteins in the four preeclampsia clusters. The overlap of perturbed pathways
  among clusters are depicted as a Venn diagram. One pathway (platelet activation)
  is shared by all clusters while most of the pathways are specific to only one cluster.
  The names of the biologically most relevant pathways are depicted. Cluster 1 (metabolic
  preeclampsia), blue; Cluster 2 (maternal anti-fetal rejection-type preeclampsia),
  orange; Cluster 3 (extracellular matrix-related preeclampsia), green; Cluster 4
  (placental preeclampsia), red.
