caption: Regulatory relationship among Lnc_AC006548.28, miR-223, and LAMC2. (a, b)
  Through inhibiting the expression of LAMC2 and Lnc_AC006548.28 and enhancing the
  expression of miR-223, cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry experiment;
  the difference was statistically significant. The regulatory relationship among
  Lnc_AC006548.28, miR-223, and LAMC2 was detected through Dual-luciferase assay.
  The difference was statistically significant.
