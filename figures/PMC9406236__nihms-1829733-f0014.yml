figure_title: Differentially-expressed genes upon FIBP knockout are enriched for cholesterol
  metabolism functions
caption: a, Correlation between FIBP and ABCA1 among acute lymphoblastic leukemia
  samples (n = 58) from the MILE project. b, Mean and standard error (error bars)
  of correlations (n = 22 leukemia subtypes per bar) between FIBP and gene members
  in the cholesterol metabolism pathway. Gene members that positively or negatively
  regulate cholesterol metabolism were shown in red or blue colors, respectively.
  The comparison between the positive and negative groups is through the two-sided
  Wilcoxon rank-sum test. c, Differential expression values for SREBF2 ChIP-Seq targets
  and non-targets. The Cistrome database contains two public human ChIP-Seq profiles
  from B lymphocytes and HepG2 cells. The regulatory score on each target gene is
  computed by the RABIT framework. Target genes are those with regulatory scores larger
  than 0.5. None target genes are those with zero regulatory scores. The gene count
  in each group is labeled above each boxplot. The thick line represents the median
  value. The bottom and top of the boxes are the 25th and 75th percentiles (interquartile
  range). Whiskers encompass 1.5 times the interquartile range. The comparison between
  groups is through the two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test. d, RT–qPCR validation of
  essential enzymes in cholesterol synthesis in mouse T cells. Normalized expression
  levels were shown for Rosa26 control and Fibp knockout conditions. The mean values
  were shown (n = 2 independent gRNAs). e, RT–qPCR levels of cholesterol metabolic
  regulators in mouse T cells with Fibp and vector control overexpression. The mean
  and standard deviation (error bars) were shown (n = 3 cell-culture replicates).
