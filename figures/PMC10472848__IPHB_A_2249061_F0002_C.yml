caption: 'Effects of SMYA on vasa vasorum angiogenesis in aortic root plaques of as
  mice. (a) Immunofluorescence double staining was used to observe the density of
  vasa vasorum in aortic root plaques, CD34 was used as an endothelial cell marker,
  and Ki67 was used as a proliferating cell marker. The results showed that the positive
  staining density of CD34 and Ki67 in as plaques were significantly reduced after
  SMYA intervention (fluorescent microscopy, ×400). (b) after SMYA intervention, the
  density of vasa vasorum in the aortic root plaque was significantly reduced. Data
  are shown as mean ± SD. **p < 0.01, compared with the normal control (NC) group.
  ##p < 0.01, compared with the model group.'

  Wnt1/β-catenin signalling pathway.
