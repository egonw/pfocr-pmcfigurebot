figure_title: The sphingolipid-ceramide, INS-7/insulin and mTOR axis drives aging
  in lpd-3 mutants
caption: a, Table summarizing effects of RNAi against genes in the insulin/mTORC1/mTORC2
  pathway on ins-7p::ins-7::GFP levels in lpd-3 mutants. b, Representative bright
  field and epifluorescence images showing ins-7p::ins-7::GFP up-regulation in lpd-3
  mutants can be suppressed by RNAi against daf-2, rict-1 or hyl-1. Scale bar, 100
  μm. c, Lipidomic quantification of hexaceramide species in wild type and lpd-3 mutants.
  Values are means ± S.D. (N = 3 biological replicates). d, Schematic showing biosynthetic
  pathways of hexaceramide, including sphingosine conversion to ceramide by HYL-1
  and ceramide to hexaceramide by CGT-1/2/3. e, RNA-seq results showing increased
  hyl-1 and cgt-1/2/3 expression in lpd-3 mutants. Values are means ± S.D. ***P <
  0.001 (N = 3 biological replicates). f, Lifespan analysis of lpd-3 mutants with
  control or rict-1 RNAi at 20 °C, showing rescued lifespan (P < 0.0001, log-rank
  test). g, Lifespan analysis of lpd-3 mutants with control or hyl-1 RNAi at 20 °C,
  showing rescued lifespan (P< 0.0001, log-rank test). h, Lifespan analysis of lpd-3
  mutants with control or sgk-1 RNAi at 20 °C, showing rescued lifespan (P < 0.0001,
  log-rank test).
