caption: 'Association of the expression of CsSCPL4 and CsSCPL5 with the formation
  of galloylated flavan‐3‐ols in tea plants.(a) Biosynthetic pathway of galloylated
  flavan‐3‐ols in tea plants.(b) The flavan‐3‐ol galloyltransferase purified from
  tea leaves was composed of CsSCPL4 and CsSCPL5. Left: In a gel filtration chromatography
  profile, the 230‐kDa protein fraction (shaded area) with the highest enzyme activity
  was analyzed by SDS‐PAGE. Right: In the SDS‐PAGE gel, four main protein bands were
  identified by LC‐MS/MS as the CsSCPL4 large subunit (Cs4‐L), the CsSCPL5 large subunit
  (Cs5‐L), the CsSCPL4 small subunit (Cs4‐S), and the CsSCPL5 small subunit (Cs5‐S).(c)
  Amino acid sequence alignment of CsSCPL4, CsSCPL5, and two known serine carboxypeptidases
  to show functional regions. CPDW II, wheat (Triticum aestivum) serine carboxypeptidase
  2, P08819; CARB L, Homo sapiens protective protein cathepsin A, P10619.(d) Quantitative
  RT‐PCR showing the expression of CsSCPL4 and CsSCPL5 in different tissues of tea
  plant.(e) Immunoblot images showing the protein expression of CsSCPL4 and CsSCPL5
  in different tissues of tea plant. Anti‐Cs4 and anti‐Cs5 correspond to the two prepared
  mouse monoclonal antibodies.(f) Accumulation patterns of epigallocatechin gallate
  (EGCG) and epicatechin gallate (ECG) in different tissues of tea plant. The values
  are the mean ± SD of three biological replicates. Different lowercase letters represent
  significant differences at P < 0.05 based on one‐way analysis of variance with Duncan''s
  multiple comparisons test. [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]'
