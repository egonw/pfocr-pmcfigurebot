caption: Advaita iPathway analysis of genes differentially expressed at 6 h PCS in
  LECs. (A) Volcano plot of genes (represented by either a blue dot for negative fold
  change or red dot for positive fold change) whose expression was statistically different
  in 6 h PCS LECs. Yellow dot represents Il19. (B) Impact analysis of the 6 h PCS
  DEGs predicting that the KEGG pathway “cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction” (p-value
  of 1.120 × 10−8) (yellow dot) is the most significantly impacted pathway. While
  other impacted KEGG pathways are represented by the other dots with black dots being
  non-significant KEGG pathways and red dots being significant KEGG pathways. (C)
  Bar graph showing which cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction genes are differentially
  expressed in LECs at 6 h PCS. (D) Bar graph showing the “epithelial cell migration”
  (p-value = 9.600 × 10−5) genes differentially expressed in 6 h PCS LECs. (E) Bar
  graph showing the DEGs implicated in the “epithelial to mesenchymal transition”
  (p-value = 0.003) pathway.
