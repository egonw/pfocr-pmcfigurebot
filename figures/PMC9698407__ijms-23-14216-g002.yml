caption: 'Supervised orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysis
  (OPLS-DA) score plot built considering the metabolomic profile of tomato leaves
  under no-salt conditions (R2 = 0.99; Q2 = 0.8) (A) and high salt conditions (R2
  = 0.96; Q2 = 0.8) (B). Biosynthetic processes affected by the biostimulants under
  low salt conditions (C) and high salt conditions (D). The metabolomic dataset produced
  through UHPLC-ESI/QTOF-MS was subjected to ANOVA and fold-change analysis (p value
  < 0.05, Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction) followed by Tukey post-hoc
  tests and differential metabolites were loaded into the PlantCyc Pathway Tool (https://www.plantcyc.org;
  accessed on 20 November 2021). The large dot represents the average (mean) of all
  data values for metabolites and the small dots represents the individual logFC for
  each metabolite. The abbreviated subcategories names on the x axis refer to: AA
  Syn: amino acids synthesis; Nucleo Syn: nucleosides and nucleotides synthesis; FA/lipids
  Syn: fatty acids and lipids synthesis; Amine Syn: amines and polyamines synthesis;
  Carbo Syn: carbohydrates synthesis; Sec Metab Syn: secondary metabolism synthesis;
  Cofactor Syn: cofactors, prosthetic groups, electron carriers, and vitamins; Hormone
  Syn: hormone synthesis; Cell-struct Syn: cell structures synthesis; Metab reg Syn:
  metabolic regulators synthesis; Other: other metabolites.'
