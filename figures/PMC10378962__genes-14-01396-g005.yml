caption: 'The expression of genes involved in cytokinin signaling. (A) The gene networks
  involved in the cytokinin (CK) signaling pathway. LOG positively regulates CK synthesis,
  and CKX negatively regulates the synthesis of CK. CK signaling positively regulates
  WUS in a manner that is dependent on type-B ARRs; type-B ARRs directly activate
  type-A ARRs, which act as negative-feedback regulators of CK signaling, and WUS
  represses type-A ARRs (ARR7/15). CK also positively regulates WUS transcription
  via cytokinin receptors called AHKs. Adapted from []. (B) Heatmap of the LOG and
  CKX gene family in WT (S) and ms mutant (M) at 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 days after
  germination (DAG). The colors correspond to the average FPKMs of three replicates,
  ranging from blue (low expression) to red (high expression). Complete data can be
  found in . (C) RT-qPCR and the RNA-seq indicated the relative expression (fold change)
  of the LOG and CKX genes in the ms mutant (M) relative to the WT (S) at 20 days
  after germination. ST: time after germination of single-stem plants (WT), MT: time
  after germination of multi-main-stem (ms) mutants.'
