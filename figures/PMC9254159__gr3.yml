caption: Hypoxia diverts the flux of glucose carbons from the mitochondria towards
  the pentose phosphate pathway and lactate. (A–B) MSCs were incubated for 48 h in
  Plasmax at 21% or 1% O2 in the presence of 5.56 mM 13C6 glucose. The relative isotopologue
  levels of intermediates of glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway (A), and TCA
  cycle intermediates, glutamate and aspartate (B) are shown. Dashed arrows indicate
  conversions involving enzymatic reactions not shown. Bars are means ± SD of values
  obtained from 8 donor-derived MSCs lines. p values refer to a two-tailed Student's
  t-test for paired samples corrected for multiple comparisons with the Holm-Sidak
  method applied to the sum of all the indicated isotopologues. DHAP, Dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate; PPP, Pentose Phosphate Pathway; TCA, Tricarboxylic Acid; AA, Amino acids.
