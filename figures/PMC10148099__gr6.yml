caption: 'Altered HIBCH expression affects mitochondrial respiration, ROS production
  and extracellular metabolite concentrations. Huh7 liver cells were transfected with
  siRNA-mediated knockdown of HIBCH and siRNA non-targeting control or with pCMV6-HIBCH
  or control (pCMV6-empty vector) plasmid (0.2 μg per well in a 24-well plate) diluted
  in Opti-MEM® Reduced Serum Media and TransIT-X2® transfection reagent (Mirus). The
  cells were treated with and without free FAs (1:1 M ratio of 50 μM PA and 50 μM
  OA) for 24 h, before analyses. A: Seahorse Cell Mito Stress Assay (OCR measurements)
  was performed using the Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer to assess the mitochondrial respiration
  in Huh7 cells (n = 10–12) Basal levels (the three first OCR measurements) were obtained,
  before adding oligomycin, CCCP and rotenone/antimycin A. Basal respiration, ATP
  production, maximal respiration, spare capacity and uncoupling were calculated for
  each well based on the OCR measurements. B: Effect of HIBCH knockdown on ROS production
  in Huh7 cells treated with or without FA for 24 h, followed by addition of fluorescent
  probe whose uptake was detected spectrophotometrically after 1 h (n = 11). C: Average
  net medium appearance per hour of the metabolites during a 24 h period (n = 6).
  FA, fatty acid; KD, knockdown; OCR, oxygen consumption rate.∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗p < 0.001 (unpaired t-test).'
