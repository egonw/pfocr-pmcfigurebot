caption: Genetic variants associated with glycolipid metabolic disorders. a. Overview
  of canonical signaling mechanisms involved in beta-cell glucose sensing and responses
  to secretory potentiators or inhibitors. TCF7L2 (Transcription factor 7-like 2)
  has a role in the canonical Wnt (Wingless-type MMTV integration site) pathway. SLC30A8
  (Solute-linked carrier 30, member 8) encodes ZnT8 (Zinc transporter 8) which regulates
  the influx of zinc into intracellular vesicles of insulin is presumed to be critical
  for insulin storage and secretion. KCNJ11 (K+ inwardly rectifying channel, subfamily
  J, member 11) and SUR1 (Sulfonylurea receptor 1) encode KATP channel together, thus
  indirectly sensing blood glucose concentrations and controlling insulin release.
  PPARs (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors) in glycolipid metabolism disorder.
