caption: qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that NF-κB expression was upregulated in HG
  and LPS states but was downregulated after si-SNHG16 transfection (a). Immunofluorescence
  analysis indicated that P-P65 expression was upregulated in HG and LPS states but
  was reduced after transfection of miR-212-3p mimic and si-SNHG16. However, treatment
  with the miR-212-3p inhibitor reversed this response (b, d). WB analysis indicated
  that P65 and P-P65 were upregulated in HG states but downregulated after si-SNHG16
