figure_title: The various biological functions of the human Rix1 scaffolding complex
caption: The human Rix1 scaffolding complex is implicated in various biological functions
  in the cell nucleus including large subunit (60 S) ribosome assembly, heterochromatin
  maintenance, and steroid receptor coactivation of transcription. PELP1 is the central
  scaffold of the Rix1 complex and is likely primarily associated with, and functions
  within, this complex in the nucleus during its roles in ribosome assembly and heterochromatin
  maintenance. PELP1 facilitation/influence on ERα coactivation is likely a secondary
  or tertiary effect in the heterogenous and functionally diverse ERα signaling pathway.
  We hypothesize that PELP1 can influence ERα coactivation in transient/unique states,
  possibly when PELP1 is dissociated from the Rix1 complex either normally or during
  altered states of PELP1 proteostasis in the cell. This dissociation from the Rix1
  complex may allow PELP1 to undergo conformational structural changes that form favorable
  LxxLL/PxxP motifs allowing for ERα co-regulation. Illustration created with BioRender.com.
