caption: Analysis and definition of biological and immunological characteristics of
  IS2. (A) Differential enrichment analysis of signaling pathways in IS2 compared
  with IS1 and IS3 in TCGA cohorts. (B) Differential expression of the TGF-Î² pathway
  and key regulators (SMAD2 and SMAD3) among immune-related subtypes. (C) Differential
  expression of the ANGIOGENESIS pathway and major regulatory genes among immune-related
  subtypes. (D) Differential expression of the REACTOME SIGNALING BY RECEPTOR TYROSINE
  KINASES pathway and major regulatory genes among immune-related subtypes.
