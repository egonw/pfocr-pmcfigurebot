figure_title: Subsurface oil reservoir origins of seep-associated thermophiles
caption: (A) Correlation of thermophilic spore-forming bacterial ASVs with thermogenic
  hydrocarbons (IndicSpecies, P < 0.05). Highest-ranking ASVs from each of 15 different
  genera are shown (representing 42 hydrocarbon-correlated ASVs in total). (B) Prevalence
  of these genera in 59 oil reservoir microbiome assessments (11 million 16S rRNA
  gene sequences in total). (C) Maximum likelihood phylogeny showing the 15 representative
  hydrocarbon-correlated ASVs and close relatives (see fig. S4 for all 42 indicator
  ASVs). Black circles at the branch nodes indicate >80% bootstrap support (1000 resamplings),
  and the scale bar indicates 10% sequence divergence as inferred from PhyML. (D)
  Metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) matching ASVs of interest [corresponding to
  brown bands in (A) to (C)] were assessed for anaerobic alkane degradation, sporulation,
  and other metabolic features characteristic of deep biosphere populations living
  in oil reservoirs. Metagenome bin numbers are indicated below the corresponding
  taxonomy (see table S8 for pathway definitions and additional gene annotations).
  Asterisks (*) denote bins with exact 16S rRNA gene sequence matches to ASVs. TCA,
  tricarboxylic acid; HC, hydrocarbon; SASPs, small acid-soluble proteins.
