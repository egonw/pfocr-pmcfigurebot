caption: Overview of the energy metabolic reprogramming in BC. The energy metabolic
  pathways, including the glycolysis, serine synthesis, glutamine metabolism, PPP,
  TCA cycle, fatty acids synthesis, and oxidation enhanced in BC, provide the sufficient
  capacity to maintain cell growth. GLUT1, glucose transporter 1; HK, hexokinase;
  PFK, phosphofructokinase; PK, pyruvate kinase; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle; α-KG,
  a-ketoglutarate; α-KGDH, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase;
  FH, fumarase; LDHA, lactate dehydrogenase A; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; G6PD,
  glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; 6PGD, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; GLS,
  glutaminase; PHGDH, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase; PSAT1, phosphoserine aminotransferase1;
  PSPH, phosphoserine phosphatase; PDK, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase; PDH, pyruvate
  dehydrogenase; CPT1, carnitine palmitoyl transferase1; FASN, fatty acid synthase;
  3-PHP, 3-phosphate hydroxypyruvate; 3-PS, 3-phosphatidylserine; ASCT, alanine-serine-cysteine-preferring
  transporter.
