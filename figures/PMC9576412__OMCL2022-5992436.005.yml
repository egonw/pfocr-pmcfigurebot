caption: 'Naringenin effectively alleviated ER stress in H/R-exposed HK-2 cells. (a)
  CCK-8 assay explored the effects of different concentrations of NAR on cell viability.
  Concentration at 200 μM was selected in the following experiments. (b–d) The mRNA
  expression in GRP78, CHOP, and caspase-12 was explored by qRT-PCR. (e, f) Naringenin
  treatment noticeably alleviated the elevated protein levels of GRP78, CHOP, and
  caspase-12 in H/R injury. Values measured during cellular experiments were carried
  out as mean ± SD, n = 3 (three independent experiments). &P < 0.05, relative to
  0 μM group; ∗P < 0.05, compared with the control group; #P < 0.05, versus the DMSO+H/R
  group; nd: no statistical difference.'
