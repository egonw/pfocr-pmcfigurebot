caption: 'A: Increases in [Na+] in blood (left) and CSF (right) in WT and Nax-KO mice
  following the intake of 2% NaCl (HS) by mice for 7 days. B: Circadian changes in
  MBP in control and HS fed mice (left) and MBP averages for 24 h (right). C: Changes
  induced in MBP by the i.p. administration of CSD. D: Changes induced in MBP by the
  i.c.v. administration of hypertonic 0.45 M [Na+] solution after a pretreatment with
  MC (left) and MC plus CSD (right). E: Lumbar SNA before and after the i.c.v. administration
  of hypertonic Na solution. Scale bar, 0.1 s. F: Changes in MBP following the i.c.v.
  administration of hypertonic Na solution in mice with a focal lesion in the SFO
  or OVLT. G: Optical stimulation of the PVN→OVLT pathway using ChR2 with a blue laser
  at 1, 5, and 20 Hz. H: Changes in MBP following the i.c.v. administration of hypertonic
  Na solution. Effects of the infusion of α-CHCA into the OVLT. I: Imaging analysis
  of pH in the intercellular space of OVLT tissue. Scale bars, 20 µm. J: Time course
  of pH changes in the regions with squares in (I). Extracellular pH in OVLT tissue
  from WT mice decreases in response to increases in [Na+]o to 160 mM. ns, not significant;
