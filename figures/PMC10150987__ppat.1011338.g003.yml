figure_title: The roles of Rpn4 in ergosterol gene expression
caption: A. Expression of the ERG genes and UPC2 in the RNA-seq experiment in wild
  type (WT) and rpn4Δ/Δ in the absence and presence of fluconazole (FLC). Shown are
  the log2 values of fold change relative to untreated (-FLC) WT, which is set to
  1 (log2 of 0). The ergosterol biosynthesis pathway is shown on the left for context.
  B. Comparison of fold change (expressed as log2 values) in the expression of the
  ERG genes and UPC2 in wild type and rpn4Δ/Δ in response to FLC. C. Same heat map
  as the ergosterol biosynthesis genes shown in  but here shown as fold change in
  gene expression relative to wild type +FLC. Cut-offs were 1.5 fold change; FDR <
  0.05. D. qPCR analysis of ERG27 gene expression in WT, rpn4Δ/Δ and complemented
  strains. Gene expression was normalized to RDN25. Data points represent three independent
  experiments, each analysed in two technical replicates. Horizontal bars represent
  the mean and error bars represent the standard error of mean. ** P < 0.01; *** P
  < 0.001 (2-way ANOVA Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test). Only significant statistical
  comparisons are shown. E. qPCRs of proteasome and ERG gene expression in response
  to proteasome inhibition with MG132. Wild type C. albicans was treated with 50 μM
  MG132 for 3 h, followed by 30 min of fluconazole (FLC) treatment (3 μg/ml). Gene
  expression was normalized to RDN25 and expressed relative to the average expression
  in the untreated wild type (See ). Data points represent biological repeats from
  4 independent experiments. In each experiment, 3 independent colonies were cultured
  for each condition, leading to 12 repeats. The horizontal bars represent the mean
  and error bars represent the standard error of mean. ** P < 0.01; *** P < 0.0001
  (2-way ANOVA Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test). Only significant statistical
  comparisons are shown.
