caption: NAMPT potentiates the HIF‐1a/STAT signaling pathway when under lactic acidosis
  conditions. A,B) The expression levels of the indicated proteins were assessed in
  WT and Nampt KO macrophages treated with 15 mM lactic acid via western blotting
  (left). Quantification of the protein amounts is shown as a ratio of HIF‐1α to vinculin
  and p‐STAT3 to STAT3 (right). C) WT and Nampt KO macrophages were pretreated with
  20 nM FK866 or 1 mM NMN for 6 h, followed by incubation with 15 mM lactic acid for
  24 h. Cell lysates were subjected to western blotting. D) WT and Nampt KO macrophages
  were incubated with conditioned medium (CM) collected from MC38 cells for 24 h.
  The indicated proteins were analyzed by western blotting. E) mRNA levels of Mct1
  and Mct4 genes in macrophages from WT and Nampt mKO mice were analyzed by quantitative
  real‐time PCR (qRT‐PCR). mRNA levels of Mct1 and Mct4 were normalized by mRNA level
  of Tbp1. F‐G) Concentrations of intracellular lactate (F) and pyruvate (G) were
  measured in WT and Nampt KO macrophages pretreated with 20 nM FK866 or 1 mM NMN
  for 6 h, followed by incubation with 15 mM lactic acid for 12 h. H) mRNA levels
  of angiogenesis‐ and M2 polarization‐related genes were quantified in WT and Nampt
  KO macrophages treated with 15 mM lactic acid using qRT‐PCR. mRNA levels of the
  indicated genes were normalized to the mRNA level of Tbp1. Results are represented
  as the mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using the unpaired two‐tailed
  Student's t‐test.
