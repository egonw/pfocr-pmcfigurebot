figure_title: The expression of the prostaglandin synthesis pathway is conserved between
  the zebrafish CHT and the mouse fetal liver
caption: 'A, B (A) Summary of prostaglandin gene expression pathways in the CHT of
  zebrafish, and (B) in mouse FL. The different symbols correspond to the C t value
  to which the threshold of detection was applied during the analysis of the qPCR:
  very high expression (++++) C t < 24; high expression (+++) 25 < C t < 28; medium
  expression (++) 29 < C t < 32; low expression (+) 33 < C t < 36; very low to no
  expression (−) C t > 37.C Proposal mechanism in which HSCs, ECs, macrophages and
  neutrophils cooperate in the embryonic niche. In normal conditions (upper panel)
  slco2b1 permits the transfer of PGE2 precursors in ECs. The deficiency of slco2b1
  (lower panel) decreases PGE2 levels in the CHT niche, generating a defect of HSC
  proliferation.  Source data are available online for this figure.'
