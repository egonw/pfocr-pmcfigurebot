caption: Effects of the in vitro treatment of granulocytes with RAPA on cell cycle
  signaling pathways and cell growth. (A) Both red, green, and deep blue shading boxes
  represent molecules of the cell cycle pathway identified in head kidney neutrophils
  of largemouth bass. Additionally, the red boxes indicate the upregulated DEGs in
  this pathway, the green boxes indicate the downregulated DEGs in this pathway, and
  the deep blue boxes indicate both upregulated and downregulated DEGs in this pathway.
  (B) Differential expression genes involved in the cell cycle pathway were analyzed
  after RAPA treatment. The color gradient represents highly upregulated (red) and
  highly downregulated (green) genes. (C,D) Representative flow cytometry dot plot
  showing proliferation of granulocytes treated with DMSO (C) or RAPA (D). (E) The
  ratio of EdU+ granulocytes from granulocyte populations treated with DMSO or RAPA
  (n = 6 fish/group). Statistical differences were determined by a paired Student’s
  t-test. Data in (E) are representative of at least three independent experiments
  (mean ± SEM). * p < 0.05.
