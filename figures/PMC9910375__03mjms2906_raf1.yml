caption: 'Structural presentation of SARS-CoV-2 (A and B) and schematic diagram of
  its life cycle in host cells (C). (A) Four structural proteins of SARS-COV-2 are
  as follows: spike (S) surface glycoprotein (as purple colour); membrane (M) protein
  (as orange colour); nucleocapsid (N) protein (as blue colour); and envelope (E)
  protein (as green colour). Genomic RNA has been represented as encased in the N
  protein. (B) The arrangement of SARS-CoV-2 genome is in the following order: 5′-replicase
  (ORF1a/b)–structural proteins [S–E–M–N]–3′ (reprinted from Li et al. () with permission).
  (C) Life cycle starts after binding of S protein to the cellular receptor ACE2.
  Following receptor binding, the S protein undergoes conformational change thus facilitating
  viral envelope fusion with the cell membrane through the endosomal pathway. Then
  RNA is released from SARS-CoV-2 into the host cell. Genome RNA is translated into
  viral replicase polyproteins pp1a and 1ab, which are then cleaved into small products
  by viral proteinases. A series of sub genomic mRNAs is produced by the polymerase
  through transcription and finally they are translated into relevant viral proteins.
  The resultant viral proteins and genome RNA are subsequently assembled into virions
  in the ER and Golgi and then transported via vesicles to be released out of the
  cell.Notes: ACE2 = angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; ER = endoplasmic reticulum;
  ERGIC = ER–Golgi intermediate compartment [reprinted from Shereen et al. () with
