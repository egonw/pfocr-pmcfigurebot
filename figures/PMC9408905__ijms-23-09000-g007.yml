caption: RSV induced N-glycosylation is mediated by the IRE1α–XBP1 arm of the UPR.
  A schematic view of the relationship between the IRE1α–XBP1 pathway of the unfolded
  protein response, accumulation of UDP-GlcNAc, protein N glycosylation, and remodeling
  of the basal lamina. IRE1 activated in the ER induces alternative splicing and produces
  the formation of activated XBP1s, which is a transcription factor controlling the
  expression of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, integrin (ITG), and ECM components,
  including fibronectin 1 (FN1). UDP-GlcNAc is a rate-limiting enzyme for protein
  N-glycosylation. After processing through the Golgi, glycosylated ECM components
  are presented on the cell surface and contribute to remodeling of the basal lamina.
