caption: Transcriptome overview of Chinese chive under salinity treatments. (A) Number
  of DEGs in each comparison. (B) Venn diagram of DEGs between salinity-treated and
  control samples. (C) KEGG pathway enrichments of DEGs in various salinity treatments.
  (D) K-means analysis and hierarchical clustering of DEGs under different salt stress
  treatments. Heatmap shows gene expression profiles of each cluster under salinity-treated
  and control samples. (E) Expression changes of DEGs with consistent expression patterns.
  The shadow area was composed of multiple lines of gene expression lines chart.
article_title: Physiological, transcriptomic, and metabolic analyses reveal that mild
  salinity improves the growth, nutrition, and flavor properties of hydroponic Chinese
  chive (Allium tuberosum Rottler ex Spr).
