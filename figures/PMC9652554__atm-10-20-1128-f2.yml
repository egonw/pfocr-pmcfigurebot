caption: 'The silencing of SAAL1 ameliorated LPS-induced lung injury and inflammation.
  (A) The messenger RNA level of SAAL1 in the lung tissues was checked by qRT-PCR.
  (B) H&E staining was used to check lung tissue injury (magnification 400×). (C)
  The W/D weight ratio of the lung tissues, (D) neutrophil number, and (E) MPO activity
  was determined. (F-H) The production of TNF-α (F), IL-6 (G), and IL-1β (H) in the
  lung tissues was measured by ELISAs. (I) The protein levels of SAAL1, TNF-α, IL-6,
  and IL-1β in the lung tissues was measured by western blotting. **, P<0.01 vs. control
  group; ##, P<0.01 vs. shNC + LPS group. SAAL1, serum amyloid A-like 1; LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction; H&E, hematoxylin and
  eosin; W/D, wet/dry; MPO, myeloperoxidase; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor alpha; IL-1β,
  interleukin-1 beta; ELISAs, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate dehydrogenase; shNC, short hairpin RNA negative control.'
