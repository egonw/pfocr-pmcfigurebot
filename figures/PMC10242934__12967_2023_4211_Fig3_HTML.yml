caption: 'Intertumoral metabolic heterogeneity in G3/G4 MB. A Integrated clustering
  of six (two G3, four G4) human MB single-cell transcriptomes is shown in a two-dimensional
  UMAP plot. B Cell clusters have been annotated regarding their affiliation to G3
  and G4 MB or as non-malignant TME cells using cell counts and different marker gene
  signatures (Additional file : Figs. S7, S8). C, D UMAP plots showing overlaps between
  G3/G4 MB groups and the metabolic gene signatures obtained from ICGC or MAGIC. E
  The analysis has been repeated using a second scRNA-seq dataset derived from Riemondy
  et al., encompassing samples from all four MB groups. Moreover, UMAPs based on single-cell
  RNA expression of metabolic genes from ccmGDB, also used for bulk RNA analysis,
  are shown for F MSMB and G RMB cohorts. Annotation of cell types from the TME and
  metabolic processes highlighted in these metabolic UMAPs has been performed as described
  in the Additional file . ECM = extracellular matrix; PPP = pentose phosphate pathway'
