figure_title: RNA sequencing performed on TAMs and CAFs demonstrate distinct in ammatory
  phenotypes in responding tumors
caption: (A) PCA plot of bulk RNA sequencing from TAMs isolated from d14 untreated
  or irradiated (SCRT; d9â€“13) tumors. Red circle=untreated; UT. Purple circles=irradiated.
  (B) The Euclidian distance between the untreated average and each irradiated sample
  plotted against tumor size. Red=untreated, blue=responders, green=nonresponders
  and quantified in (C). (D) DAMP/PAMP pathway analysis of differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs) from responder or nonresponder TAMs compared to TAMs from untreated
  tumors. (E) DEGs from responding sorted TAMs compared to nonresponding TAMs analyzed
  by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). (F) DEGs between responding and nonresponding
  cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) plotted on a hierarchical clustering heatmap.
  Teal box=nonresponders and untreated and pink box=responders. (G) GSEA analysis
  identified differences in predominately immune related signatures in CAFs from responder
  tumors. N=5 untreated, 10 irradiated (6 responder, 4 nonresponders for TAMs; 4 responders,
  6 nonresponders for CAFs)
