caption: 'Effect of MXC on inflammatory response protein expressions and oxidative
  stress in LPS-treated primary neurons of offspring from prenatal inflammation exposure:
  (a) The levels of IL-1β, IL-6, PGD-2, and TNF-α in the primary cultured neurons
  (n = 6). (b,c) Western blots analysis of the relative protein contents in the primary
  cultured neurons. (b) The expression of APP, Aβ, COX-2, DP2, and DP1 was detected
  by Western blotting using specific antibodies in the primary neurons of rats; protein
  contents were plotted for NS + CSF, LPS + CSF, NS + LPS, LPS + LPS, LPS + CSF. MXC,
  NS + LPS + MXC, LPS + LPS + MXC. (c) The relative optical density was normalized
  to β-actin; Each result of the NS group is normalized to 1. (d,e) Effect of MXC
  on the levels of MDA and the activity of SOD in LPS-treated primary neurons of offspring
  after inflammation during pregnancy. (d) and the levels of MDA. (e) The activity
  of SOD. Data are mean ± SEM, n = 4. (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 vs.
  NS group, # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01 vs. LPS group, ^ p < 0.05, ^^ p < 0.01 vs. NS
