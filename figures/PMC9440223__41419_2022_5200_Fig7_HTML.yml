figure_title: KCTD9 inhibits CRC growth and metastasis in vivo
caption: A, B SW620 cells without (pCDH) or with overexpression KCTD9 (pCDH-KCTD9)
  were subcutaneously inoculated into nude mice. Images (A) and weights (B) of the
  excised xenografts recovered at 21 days. Data represent mean ± SD, n = 6 mice per
  group, two-tailed Student’s t test, ***p < 0.001. C–E SW620 cells without (pCDH)
  or with overexpression KCTD9 (pCDH-KCTD9) were inoculated under the spleen capsule
  of nude mice to measure spleen to liver metastasis using a luciferase-based bioluminescence
  assay. Images of the excised spleens recovered at 28 days (C) along with bioluminescence
  images of whole livers (D) and hematoxylin and eosin (E) stained sections of liver
  tissue. n = 5 mice per group. F, G Tissue microarrays containing 80 human CRC tissues
  were analyzed in parallel for expression of KCTD9 and β-catenin using immunohistochemical
  (IHC) staining. Representative staining of cases with low and high expression of
  KCTD9, respectively (F) and quantification of IHC staining as immunoreactive scores
  (IRS) (G). The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was calculated as shown. (n = 80).
