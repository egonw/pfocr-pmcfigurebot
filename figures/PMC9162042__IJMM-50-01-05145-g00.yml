caption: Domain structures and functions of 53BP1. Recruitment of 53BP1 to DSB sites
  requires the minimal focus forming region, comprising the OD, the GAR motif, the
  tandem Tudor domain, the UDR motif, and the LC8 binding domain. The N-terminal S-T/Q
  phosphorylation sites mediate interactions with PTIP and RIF1/Shieldin/CST/Polα/Primase
  axis, which control DNA end resection. The C-terminal includes two BRCT domains
  connected in series, which are 53BP1 interacting with other proteins in a phosphorylation-independent
  pathway, such as p53 and MUM1 (or EXPAND1). 53BP1; p53-binding protein 1; DSB, double-strand
  break; OD, oligomerization domain; GAR, glycine-arginine-rich; UDR, ubiquitin-dependent
  recognition; LC8, dynein light chain; PTIP, Pax transactivation domain-interacting
  protein; BRCT, breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein carboxyl-terminal; RIF1,
  RAP1-interacting factor 1; MUM1, mutated melanoma-associated antigen 1; CST, CTC1-STN1-TEN1;
  Polα, polymerase-α; DYNLL1, dynein light chain 1; PRMT1, protein arginine N-methyltransferase
  1; H2AX, H2A histone family member X.
