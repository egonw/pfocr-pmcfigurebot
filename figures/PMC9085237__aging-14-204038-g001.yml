caption: Illustration of TP53â€™s interactions with other signaling pathways important
  in regulation of cell growth and sites of interaction for chemotherapeutic drugs,
  certain signal transduction inhibitors, natural products and nutraceuticals. Green
  arrows = induction of a pathway, red arrows = suppression of a pathway.
article_title: Wild type and gain of function mutant TP53 can regulate the sensitivity
  of pancreatic cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, EGFR/Ras/Raf/MEK, and PI3K/mTORC1/GSK-3
  pathway inhibitors, nutraceuticals and alter metabolic properties.
