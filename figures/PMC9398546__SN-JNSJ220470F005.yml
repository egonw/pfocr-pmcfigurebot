caption: Simulation of the receptive field adaptation competition model. A, Schematic
  diagram of RF center-surround components (top) and overall RF structures (bottom)
  before (dotted line) and after (solid line) adaptation. B, Schematic diagram of
  decay functions of RF center and surround components during biased adaptation. Blue
  line indicates the response change ratio of RF center, and red line indicates that
  of RF surround. C, Two typical fitting results of bidirectional plastic Area 17
  neurons using the RF adaptation-competition model. Black circles indicate experimental
  data, whereas red curves indicate fitting result. D, Histogram of fitting quality
  (R2) for bidirectional plastic Area 17 neurons. E, Same as C of an adaptation-only
  Area 17 neuron. F, Same as D of adaptation-only Area 17 neurons. G, Fitting results
  of population peak response change ratio curve of Area 17 neurons using the RF adaptation
  competition model. Black circles indicate experimental data, whereas red curve indicates
  fitting result. H, The parameter spaces showing the neural peak response change
  ratios under different magnitude factors (decay factors fixed). Left, Parameter
  space at BAP 0.18. Right, Parameter space at BAP 0.79. Black solid frames indicate
  proper parameter ranges of each subgraph, whereas black dashed frames indicate proper
  parameter ranges of the other subgraph, so that there is a 0% ∼ 40% increase at
  BAP 0.18 and a −40% ∼ 0% change at BAP 0.79. White frames in two subgraphs indicate
  the intersection of proper parameter ranges. I, Same as H of decay factors (magnitude
  factors fixed).
