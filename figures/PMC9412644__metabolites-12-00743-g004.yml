caption: 'Correlations of average fold difference of mice consuming the SOLF diet
  compared to the POLF diet among brown adipose tissue, white adipose tissue, and
  plasma. Average fold difference was calculated for those lipid mediators that were
  changed by diet in univariate analysis in at least one of the three tissues reported.
  Average fold difference (reported in ) was calculated by dividing the average of
  each metabolite in the SOLF diet by that of the POLF diet. Regression analysis was
  used to determine similarities in fold changes in (a) WAT vs. BAT, (b) BAT vs. plasma,
  and (c) WAT vs. plasma, reported here with 95% confidence intervals. Those metabolites
  not detected in one of the two tissues was included as a value of 0. p < 0.05 indicates
  a correlation significantly different from zero. (d) The sum of the average fold
  differences for each tissue was computed and the contributions of each metabolic
  pathway to the total fold change was determined. Enzymatic pathway abbreviations:
  COX—cyclooxygenase; LOX—lipoxygenase; Auto—auto-oxidation; CYP—cytochrome P450;
  sEH—soluble epoxide hydrolase; ADH—alcohol dehydrogenase; PLD—phospholipase D.'
