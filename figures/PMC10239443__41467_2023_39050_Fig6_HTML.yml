figure_title: Decreased expression of TGF-β receptors and impaired metabolism in the
  proximal tubule of CKD patients
caption: a UMAP plot of normalized data clustering. Numbers represent PT clusters.
  b Bar plot depicting the proportion of PT cells per clusters in healthy and CKD
  kidney biopsy datasets. c UMAPs showing TGFBRs (1, 2, and 3) features in healthy
  and CKD PT cells. d Differential gene expression analysis showing a significant
  decrease of TGFBRs (1, 2, and 3) and TGFBRAP1 in CKD PT cells as compared to healthy
  PT cells. e Pathway activity analysis showing impaired mitochondrial biogenesis,
  complex I activity, and metabolism. N = 5 CKD patients (eGFR<60) and 3 healthy controls.
  Differential gene expression was evaluated using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test from
  the FindMarkers function. Calculation of the pathway scores was performed using
  REACTOME genesets.
