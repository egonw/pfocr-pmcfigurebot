caption: The ROS-generating molecule dtBHQ inhibits NRF2 and global protein synthesis;
  opposing inhibitory and stimulatory roles for ROS/H2O2 in the NRF2/ARE pathway.
  (A) Schematic of the generation of ROS by dtBHQ. See text for details. (B) Cells
  were treated for 2 h with dtBHQ prior to Western blot analysis. MG-132 was added
  10 min post-treatment. (C) Treatments are as for B, with MnTMPyP added with dtBHQ
  as indicated. (D) Cells were treated for 2 h with 50 µM dtBHQ, 2.5 μM sulforaphane,
  and MnTMPyP as indicated, prior to harvest and global protein synthesis analysis
  as for . * p < 0.001. (E) Cells were treated for 2 h with 2.5 μM sulforaphane, dtBHQ,
  and H2O2 as indicated, prior to Western blot analysis. (F,G) Cells were treated
  with 2.5 μM sulforaphane and/or H2O2 (F) or dtBHQ (G) 18 h prior to harvest as for
  A. Where error bars are not shown, they are shorter than the height of the symbol.
  For Western blots (B,C,E), images are representative of two biological replicates
  with two technical replicates each, and total protein was assessed by Fast Green
  staining.
