caption: 'Huangqin decoction activates the Sirt1/NF-κB pathway in palmitic acid-induced
  HepG2 cells. Data are presented as mean ± SD of at least three independent experiments.
  aP < 0.01 vs the control group, bP < 0.05 and cP < 0.01 vs the palmitic acid group.
  A: Expression levels of Sirt1, p-NF-κB/NF-κB, p-IRS-2/IRS-2, sterol regulatory element-binding
  protein 1, fatty acid synthase, and cluster of differentiation 36 in HepG2 cells;
  B–G: Semi-quantitative analysis of these proteins; H: Representative images of immunofluorescent
  staining of Sirt1 and NF-κB in HepG2 cells. CD36: Cluster of differentiation 36;
  DAPI: 4'',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; FAS: Fatty acid synthase; GAPDH: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; HQD, Huangqin decoction; PA: Palmitic acid; SREBP: Sterol regulatory
  element-binding protein.'

  resistance in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease by triggering Sirt1/NF-κB pathway.
