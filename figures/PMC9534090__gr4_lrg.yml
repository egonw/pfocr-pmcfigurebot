caption: Manipulation of the host immune response by the monkeypox virus. MPXV can
  escape from the protein kinase R pathway through reduction of mRNA synthesis and
  ablation of type-I interferon mediating protein kinase R phosphorylation. MPXV can
  also reduce the production of inflammatory mediators by interfering with phosphorylation
  of the MAPK/ERK1/2 pathways. It suppresses cell apoptosis by increasing phosphorylation
  of the ATK pathway. MPXV can prevent natural killer cells from killing virus-infected
  cells and secreting inflammatory cytokines. MPXV can also interfere with the adaptive
  immune response by hindering T cell receptor trans-signaling.
