caption: 'GSVA analysis between High and Low-Risk group. A: Heatmap of the results
  of the GSVA enrichment analysis of genes between High and Low-Risk group in the
  Combined dataset. The vertical axis of the heatmap listed different pathway or gene
  set names. Horizontally, there are two groups representing experimental subgroups,
  namely, High and Low-risk group of NAFLD samples. The depth of color represents
  the enrichment level of gene sets in the corresponding subgroup. Colors range from
  orange to yellow-white, where orange indicates positive enrichment scores, suggesting
  upregulation or enhanced activity of the associated pathway in that subgroup; while
  yellow-white represents scores close to zero or negative, indicating downregulation
  or no significant change in the pathway. B: Boxplot of the GSVA enrichment pathways
  between High and Low-Risk group in the Combined dataset. The box in the boxplot
  represents the interquartile range of the data (the middle 50% of the data), with
  the median represented by the middle line. Whiskers indicate the range of data variation.
  Orange and gray boxes represent the High and Low-Risk group, respectively. GSVA,
  Gene Set Variation Analysis. ns, P ≥ 0.05; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
