caption: Effect of BSP1, BSP3, BSP4, and VC on SOD/CAT/MDA in PC12 cells. (A–C) PC12
  cells were incubated with BSP1, BSP3, BSP4, and VC for 4 h. (D–F) PC12 cells were
  preincubated with BSP1, BSP3, BSP4, and VC for 4 h, then treated with lead for 24
  h. SOD results are shown in (A,D). CAT results are shown in (B,E). MDA results are
  shown in (C,F). The value of the bars indicates the means ± SD (n = at least 3).
  The same letter means there is no significant difference, and different letters
  mean there is a significant difference (p < 0.05).
