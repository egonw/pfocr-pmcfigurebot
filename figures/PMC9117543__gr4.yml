caption: The similar variation of circadian gene expression in livers of old and iron-overload
  mice.A, KEGG significant enrichment analysis for the environment adaptation pathway.
  Top 20 altered pathways mapped with downregulated DEGs and upregulated DEGs in iron-overload
  mice (left). Top 20 altered pathways mapped with downregulated DEGs and upregulated
  DEGs in old mice. CK, control group; HI, iron overload group; OLD, old group (right).
  Red bars indicated an altered circadian pathway. Four-week-old male C57BL/6 mice
  were used to induce iron overload by i.p. injection of iron dextran (5 mg/mouse/day)
  twice a week for 3 weeks, and mice were sacrificed 1 week after the last injection.
  And 64-week-old male mice were used for the old group. Circadian expression of six
  core clock genes in the livers. Diurnal mRNA levels of (B) Bmal1, (C) Clock, (D)
  Per1, (E) Per2, (F) Cry1, and (G) Cry2 were measured by real-time RT–PCR in livers
  of young (8 weeks old) and old (64 weeks old) mice. OLD, old group; YNG, young group.
  Diurnal mRNA levels of (H) Bmal1, (I) Clock, (J) Per1, (K) Per2, (L) Cry1, and (M)
  Cry2 were measured by real-time PCR in livers of mice fed on normal chow diet (ND)
  or high-iron diet (HID) for 2 weeks from the age of 6 weeks. Solid lines represent
  experimental response curves; dashed lines indicate fit cosine curves. The solid
  horizontal lines indicate mesors. All data are presented as means ± SEM (n = 4 for
  each time point). DEG, differentially expressed gene; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of
  Genes and Genomes.
