caption: Production pathways for isobutanol and 2/3MB (a) The promoter Pgrac of plasmid
  pHT01-65 was induced by IPTG to initiate transcription and expression of the kivD
  and adhA genes. The promoter PmanP of plasmid pCas-69 initiates transcription and
  expression of the alsS, ilvC and ilvD genes upon mannose induction. (b) Schematic
  representation of heterologous pathway leading to isobutanol and 3MB formation in
  B. subtilis. PEP (phosphoenolpyruvate), PYR (pyruvate), OAA (oxaloacetate), ACLAC
  (acetolactate), DHVAL (2,3-dihydroxy-3-methyl butanoate), KIV (2-ketoisovalerate),
  KIC (2-ketoisocaproate), BUT (butanol), IBOH (isobutanol), 2MB (2-methyl-1-butanol),
  3MB (3-methyl-1-butanol), PHPYR (phenylpyruvate), PHETA (2-phenyl ethanol), NADPH
  (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), PPP (pentose phosphate pathway),
  TCA (citrate cycle), BPP (biosynthetic 2-ketoisovalerate precursor pathway). (c)
  Results of microaerobic fermentation of wild-type strain GI0 and ten deletion mutants
  (GI1-3, GI5-8 and GI10-12) at 30 Â°C for 72 h. Orange represents isobutanol titers
  produced by 11 strains, red represents titers producing a mixture of 2MB and 3MB,
  and brown indicates acetoin titers. Values and error bars represent mean and s.d.
  (n = 3), respectively. * p < 0.1, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 as determined by a
  two-tailed t-test.
