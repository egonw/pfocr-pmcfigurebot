caption: Reduced expression of HOPX activates Wnt signaling pathway in esophageal
  epithelium. (A) Representative immunohistochemical images of middle esophagus from
  WT E18.5 and Grhl3KO embryo esophagus (n = 3 each) stained with HOPX antibody. Scale
  bar = 50 μm. (B) Representative immunohistochemical images of middle esophagus from
  WT and Grhl3-cKO adult esophagus (n = 3 each) stained with HOPX antibody. Scale
  bar = 50 μm. (C) The mRNA expression of Hopx was detected by Q-RT-PCR from esophagus
  collected from WT (n = 3) and Grhl3KO mice (n = 6). Relative gene expression was
  calculated using HPRT as the housekeeping gene. Data were represented as mean ±
  standard deviation. Statistics were calculated using unpaired, two-tailed Student
  t test. (D) The mRNA expression of indicated genes by Q-RT-PCR from esophagus collected
  from WT (n = 4) and Grhl3KO mice (n = 4). Relative gene expression was calculated
  using HPRT as the housekeeping gene. Data were represented as mean ± standard deviation.
  Statistics were calculated using multiple unpaired t test using GraphPad prism.
  (E) The mRNA expression of indicated genes by Q-RT-PCR from esophageal epithelium
  collected from WT (n = 6) and Grhl3-cKO mice (n = 6). Relative gene expression was
  calculated using HPRT as the housekeeping gene. Data were represented as mean ±
  standard deviation. Statistics were calculated using multiple unpaired t test using
  GraphPad Prism. (F) The mRNA expression of indicated genes by Q-RT-PCR from esophageal
  tumors collected from WT (n = 5–6) and Grhl3-cKO mice (n = 5–6). Relative gene expression
  was calculated using HPRT as the housekeeping gene. Data were represented as mean
  ± standard deviation. Statistics were calculated using multiple unpaired t test
  using GraphPad Prism. (G) ChIP-Q-PCR from EPC cells demonstrating more than 4-fold
  enrichment over immunoglobulin G (IgG) in WNT2 and WNT9a promoter (n =3 replicates).
  Statistics were calculated using unpaired, one-tailed Student t test.
