caption: GS-Rg1 inhibited expression of miR-126 and lung cancer growth. (a) GS-Rg1
  significantly inhibited the expression level of miR-126 in A540 cell line (∗P <
  0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01); (b) GS-Rg1 promoted the expression level of caspase 3 in the
  A540 cell line (∗P < 0.05); (c) GS-Rg1 promoted the expression level of caspase
  9 in the A540 cell line (∗P < 0.05); (d) GS-Rg1 significantly inhibited cell viability
  of A549 cells (∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001); (e) GS-Rg1 significantly inhibited
  the expression level of miR-126 in the H1650 cell line (∗P < 0.05); (f) GS-Rg1 promoted
  the expression level of caspase 3 in H1650 cell line (∗P < 0.05); (g) GS-Rg1 promoted
  the expression level of caspase 9 in the H1650 cell line (∗P < 0.05); (h) GS-Rg1
  significantly inhibited cell viability of A549 cells (∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001).
