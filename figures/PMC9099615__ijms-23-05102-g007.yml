caption: 'ATD-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by blocking the STAT3 pathway
  in Huh7 cells: (A) after treatment with various concentrations of ATD for 24 h in
  Huh7 cells, the protein levels of p-STAT3, STAT3, and MVK were determined with immunoblotting.
  In addition, after treatment with various concentrations of S3I201 for 24 h in Huh7
  cells, the protein levels of Bcl-XL, Bcl-2, and cyclin D1 (B), as well as p53 and
  MVK (C), were determined with immunoblotting analysis. Î²-actin or GADPH were used
  as the loading control. After treatment with various concentrations of ATD in the
  PLC/PRF/5 cells (mutp53 R249S), the protein levels of p53 (DO-1), p-STAT3, STAT3,
  MVK (D), Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and cyclin D1 (E) were determined with immunoblotting.'
