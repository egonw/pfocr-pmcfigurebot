caption: Measuring several steps in the receptor-induced activation of PLCβ and depletion
  of PtdIns(4,5)P2in response to a muscarinic agonist. (A) Cartoon of the signaling
  pathway from muscarinic agonist to KCNQ2/3 channel. PIP2, PtdIns(4,5)P2. (B) YFP-CFP
  FRET signals, normalized to start at zero, monitor conformational changes within
  the receptor (intraR, intramolecular FRET between CFP and YFP labels in the receptor),
  receptor interaction with Gβ, Gαq interaction with PLCβ, and depletion of PtdIns(4,5)P2.
  Note logarithmic time axis. Each line comes from tsA201 cells transfected with M1
  receptors, the appropriate pair of FRET probes, or, in the case of IKCNQ2/3, with
  KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 channel subunits. Data assembled from .
