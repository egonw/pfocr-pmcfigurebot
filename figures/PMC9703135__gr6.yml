caption: The PPAR-α pathway was decreased in mTORC2 KO liver during liver regeneration.
  (A) Relative mRNA expression levels of ketogenesis-associated genes at the indicated
  time points in Ctrl (green line) or R-LKO liver (red line). The expression of PPAR-α,
  Cytb, Hmgcs2, and Hmgcl were normalized to the levels of control hepatocytes before
  PH (0 h). Means ± SD, 4 mice per time point. (D) Fatty acid metabolic model in the
  normal liver between 0 and 36 hours after PH. The VersaDoc Imaging System (Bio-Rad)
  and software was used to visualize proteins. ImageJ was used to quantify the band
  densities. ∗P < .05, ∗∗P < .01 and ∗∗∗P < .001.
