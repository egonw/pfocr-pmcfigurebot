caption: MOBT regulated the downstream target genes of MEF2c. (A) A ChIP-seq experiment
  was performed to identify genes binding with MEF2c. (B) RNA-seq was performed to
  analyze the differentially expressed genes. (C) Combined analysis revealed a total
  of 76 target genes in the ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data, with 11 upregulated and 65
  downregulated genes. (D) The KEGG analysis revealed that the 76 target genes regulated
  by MEF2c were significantly enriched in the Hippo, Wnt, and MAPK signaling pathways.
  (E) The 44 significant differentially expressed genes that were selected from 76
  target genes and listed in the hierarchical clustering of RNA-seq. (F) The binding
  sites for MEF2c in the TAGLN2 and FMN1 genes were analyzed.
