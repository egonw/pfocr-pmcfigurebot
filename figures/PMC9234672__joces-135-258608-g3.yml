caption: 'Cell cycle regulation and primary cilia biogenesis are age-dependent processes
  in CGNPs and medulloblastoma. (A) Gene expression profiles of CGNP genes commonly
  mutated in medulloblastoma, extracted from the RNA-seq data set. Curves represent
  the average expression level from n=3 biological replicates, error bars indicate
  s.d. (FPM=fragments per million, E, embryonic day; P, postnatal day). See also Fig. S2.
  (B) Cross-species comparison. Heatmap showing unsupervised hierarchical clustering
  of differentially expressed human medulloblastoma genes (patient-age groups, 0–3 years,
  4–11 years, 12 years and older) and CGNP orthologous genes. Blue dots represent
  patient samples, red dots represent CGNP samples. Lowest gene cluster indicated
  by red bar. (C) Gene expression profiles of CGNP genes associated with the SHH signaling
  pathway, extracted from the RNA-seq data set presented as in A. See also Table S1.
  (D) Enrichment map representing biological processes enriched in the lower (red)
  gene cluster of the cross-species comparison heatmap in B. No enriched processes
  were found in the upper gene clusters. Each node represents a biological process.
  Related biological processes are grouped and labeled by biological theme (curved
  dashed lines). Biological processes connected by edges have genes in common. Enriched
  biological processes were determined with the Database of Annotation, Visualization
  and Integrated Discovery (DAVID), v.6.8 (Benjamini-corrected q=0.1, P=0.01) and
  visualized with the Enrichment Map app in Cytoscape. (E) Confocal images showing
  ARL13B protein expression (primary cilium marker) in human fetal cerebellum (upper
  left panel) and in SHH medulloblastoma samples of 3–4-year-old patients (upper right
  and lower panels). Counterstaining by DAPI. Images representative of n=2 experimental
  repeats. Insets showing higher magnification (2.25×). Scale bars: 20 µm.'
