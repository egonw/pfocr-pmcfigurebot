caption: 'MCFL2 is involved in sorafenib-resistance in HCC. (a) MCF2L is significantly
  upregulated in HCC through analyzing the data from the public dataset The Cancer
  Genome Atlas (TCGA; https://cancergenome.nih.gov/). (b) The expression of MCF2L
  in paired HCC tissues. (c) MCF2L is significantly increased in HCC cells-treated
  with sorafenib both on mRNA (left panel) and protein (right panel) levels. ANT:
  adjacent normal tissue; âˆ—P < 0.05.'
