caption: Three Integrated pathways of tryptophan metabolism. Tryptophan (Trp) is an
  essential amino acid obtained from dietary protein. The majority of Trp is metabolized
  alongside the kynurenine pathway to produce different molecules collectively referred
  to as kynurenines. The most widely studied fate of Trp is the downstream conversion
  to serotonin and melatonin. Trp availability is also altered by gut microbes generating
  either indole or its derivatives, tryptamine or serotonin, which can affect the
  gastrointestinal tract. TDO, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase; IDO, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase;
  Fmd, formamidase; KAT, kynurenine aminotransferase; KrA, kynureninase A; KMO, kynurenine
  hydroxylase (monooxygenase); KrB, kynureninase B; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides;
  TpH, tryptophan hydroxylase; AAAD, aromatic amine acid decarboxylase; AANAT, arylakylamine-N-acetyltransferase;
  HIOMT, hydroxyindolo-O-methyltransferase; MAO, monoamine oxidase; AlDh, aldehyde
  dehydrogenase; TrpD, tryptophan decarboxylase; TNA, tryptophanase; SLT, sulfotransferase;
  TMO, tryptophan monooxygenase; IaaH, indoleacetamide hydrolase; IaaD, indoleacetate
  decarboxylase; Arat, aromatic amino acid aminotransferase; ID, indolepyruvate decarboxylase;
  ADhn, alcohol dehydrogenase; fldH, phenyllactate dehydrogenase; ILD, indolelactate
  dehydratase; ACD, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase.
