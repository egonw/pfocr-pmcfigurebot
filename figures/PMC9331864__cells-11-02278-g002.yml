caption: The gut microbiota composition and inferred functional content of gut microbiota
  between of control (CON) and undernourished (UND) C57BL/6 mice. (A) Relative abundance
  at the phylum level for groups of CON (n = 6) and UND (n = 7) C57BL/6 mice; (B)
  Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) of Bray–Curtis distances among groups of CON
  (n = 6) and UND (n = 7) C57BL/6 mice. Each point corresponds to a community from
  a single mouse. Colors indicate group identity. Ellipses show the 95% confidence
  intervals. Intra-group differences were evaluated using ADONIS test (p < 0.05);
  (C) ANCOM-BC log fold change showing differentially abundant taxonomic clades in
  the gut microbiota of UND (n = 7) versus CON (n = 6) C57BL/6 mice; (D) LEfSe LDA
  scores showing significant pathway differences between CON (n = 6) and UND (n =
  7) C57BL/6 mice of PICRUSt predicted the relative MetaCyc pathways abundances. Significant
  differences between groups were corrected with Benjamini–Hochberg False Discovery
  Rate p FDR < 0.05.
