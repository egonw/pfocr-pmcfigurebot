caption: Dopamine (DA) actions in the spleen. (A) DA acts on dopamine receptors (DR)
  and increases the proliferation of IFNÎ³-producing splenocytes stimulated with concanavalin
  A (ConA) or anti-CD3. (B) All five DA receptors have been detected in splenic NK
  cells. D1-like receptors (D1R and D5R), when stimulated by DA, lead to increased
  cytotoxicity. By contrast, when DA acts on D2-like (D2R, D3R and D4R) receptors,
  it decreases NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Both actions, although opposite of each
  other, are due to the modulation of the cAMP-PKA-CREB signalling pathway through
  DA receptors.
