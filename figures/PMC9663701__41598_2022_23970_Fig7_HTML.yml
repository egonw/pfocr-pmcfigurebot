caption: Proposed model for the negative feedback function of Srk1 in the MAPK pathway
  stress recovery. In response to stress, activation of the Wis1-Sty1 axis induces
  the transcription of the CESR â€“Core Environmental Stress Response- genes, including
  srk1 and pyp1/pyp2. The presence of the new Srk1 in the cytoplasm phosphorylates
  Wis1 in the Sty1-binding domain, which disrupts activation of the Wis1-Sty1 axis
  and allows stress phosphatases, Pyp1 and Pyp2, to inactivate Sty1.
