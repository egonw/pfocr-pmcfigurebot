figure_title: Tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells display a distinct phenotype in GIST
caption: (A-E) Bulk RNAseq was performed on CD8+ T cells sorted from tumors, tumor-draining
  lymph nodes (i.e., mesenteric nodes), and spleens of 4 untreated KitV558Δ/+ mice.
  (A) Principal component analysis and (B) similarity of the transcriptomes of the
  sorted CD8+ T cells from tumor (T), spleen (S), and tumor-draining lymph node (N).
  (C) Hallmark inflammatory response, interferon gamma response, glycolysis, and IL2/STAT5
  signaling pathway gene set enrichment (normalized enrichment score shown; all values
  p < 0.05), (D) heatmap depicting normalized expression of select antigen response
  genes, and (E) volcano plot comparing bulk RNAseq of the sorted CD8+ T cells from
  KitV558Δ/+ tumor or node. (F-H) Flow cytometry of tumors, tumor-draining lymph nodes
  (i.e., mesenteric nodes), and/or spleens of untreated KitV558Δ/+ mice. (F) Frequency
  of TEM, TCM, and TN among CD8+ T cells in tumor, spleen, or tumor-draining lymph
  node (n=4 mice/group). (G) Frequency of CCR7+, IL-7R+, Tbet+, Eomes+, and PD-1+
  cells among CD8+ T cells from tumors of KitV558Δ/+ mice (n=4 mice/group). (H) Frequency
  of CD103+ and CD103− effector CD8+ T cells from tumors of KitV558Δ/+ mice (n=3 mice/group).
  Each column in (D) represents an individual mouse. NS, non-significant; FC, fold-change.
  Data represent mean ± SEM; *, p < 0.05.
