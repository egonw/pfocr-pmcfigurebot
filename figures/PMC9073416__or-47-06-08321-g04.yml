caption: Enriched pathways associated with ISG15. The scatter diagrams depict the
  hallmark pathways (A) positively and (B) negatively associated with high ISG15 levels.
  The x- and y-axes show the NES and P-values, respectively. (C) Gene Set Enrichment
  Analysis results for ISG15 expression and ‘hallmark_MYC_targets_V2’ pathway. (D)
  Representative cell cycle profile images of HEC-1A cells transfected with specific
  or control siRNA. (E) Quantification of G0 and G1 cell percentage in endometrial
  carcinoma cells transfected with specific or control siRNA. (F) Detection of p-RB1
  and PCNA expression in endometrial cancer cells transfected with without siRNA by
  western blotting. (G) Scatter diagrams showing the positive correlation between
  cell markers responsible for the G1/S transition. All P-values and R-values were
  calculated with one-way ANOVA and Pearson's correlation analysis. ISG15, interferon-stimulated
  gene 15; NES, normalized enrichment scores; MYC, MYC proto-oncogene protein; siRNA,
  small interfering RNA; NC, negative control; CCND3, G1/S-specific cyclin-D3; CCNE1,
  G1/S-specific cyclin-E1; E2F1, transcription factor E2F1.
