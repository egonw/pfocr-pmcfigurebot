caption: Directed acyclic graph representing the casual relationship between HbA1c
  and postoperative complications. HbA1c, glycated haemoglobin; MI, myocardial infarction;
  CCF, congestive cardiac disease; PVD, peripheral vascular disease; and Composite,
  30‐day major postoperative complication and 90‐day all‐cause mortality. The green
  line from HbA1c to the composite outcome represents the direct casual pathway of
  HbA1c (direct effect). The blue risk factors represent mediators through which HbA1c
  also acts. If, after adjustment of mediators, an association is found between HbA1c
  and the composite outcome, this would suggest that HbA1c is not dependent on the
  mediators, that is, has a direct effect on the composite outcome. A direct effect
  would support optimisation of HbA1c before surgery. No direct effect would support
  optimisation of the mediators before surgery. [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]
