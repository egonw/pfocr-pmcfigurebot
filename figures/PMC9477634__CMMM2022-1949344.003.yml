caption: 'CX3CL1 derived from BMSCs alleviated the pathology-induced Aβ1-42 in SH-SY5Y.
  (a–d) Western blotting examined Aβ, tau, and p-Tau protein expressions relative
  to β-actin. (e and f) The relative integrated density of Iba1 was evaluated by IF.
  (g) The axons of SH-SY5Y cells were observed using inverted microscope. (h–k) Western
  blotting examined SNAP25, Synapsin1, and PSD95 protein levels relative to β-actin.
  ∗p < 0.05 versus control group; #p < 0.05 versus Aβ group; &p < 0.05 versus Aβ+MSC
