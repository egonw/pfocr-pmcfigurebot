caption: 'SSD against mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress by inhibiting
  SIRT1/NLRP3 signaling. (a) The compromised mitochondria were measured using TEM.
  Scale, 1 μm. Yellow arrow: normal mitochondria; red arrow: swollen mitochondria.
  (b and c) Flow cytometry was used to analyze mitochondrial membrane potential. (d)
  The content of ROS in serum samples of rats in each group was tested by enzyme-linked
  immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The generation of MDA (e) GSH-Px (f) and SOD (g) in
  serum samples was assayed by corresponding commercial kits. SPID: sequela of pelvic
  inflammatory disease; SSD: Shipi Shugan Decoction; FQC: Fuke Qianjin Capsules; TEM:
  transmission electron microscopy. ∗∗∗P < 0.001 (versus sham), ##P < 0.01 (versus
  SPID), ###P < 0.001 (versus SPID), &&P < 0.05 (versus SSD), and &&P < 0.01 (versus
  SSD). Data represent the Mean ± SEM.'
