caption: 'The effect of carambolaside W on the growth of MDCK cells was determined
  by the CCK8 assay. (A) Cytotoxicity assay to detect whether carambolaside W is harmful
  to MDCK cells. (B) Antiviral assay: to detect the inhibitory effect of carambolaside
  W on infection with H1N1 influenza virus. (C) Half maximal inhibitory concentration
  (IC50) caused by carambolaside W on MDCK cells. (D) Half maximal effective concentration
  (EC50) of carambolaside W on MDCK cells after the addition of H1N1 virus. (E) Observation
  by phase contrast microscopy of the effect of carambolaside W on the morphology
  of MDCK cells and the morphological effect of carambolaside W on MDCK cells infected
  with H1N1 influenza virus. Bars with different characters are statistically different
  at p < 0.0001 (****) and p < 0.001 (***) vs. the control group. Each experiment
  was repeated at least three times (n = 3).'
