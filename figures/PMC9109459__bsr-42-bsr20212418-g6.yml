figure_title: IL-6-induced LCN2 regulates cell survival and anti-apoptotic molecules
  mediated by the NF-kB/STAT3 pathway
caption: (A) After transfection with p65, STAT3 and LCN2 siRNA, DLD-1 cells were stimulated
  with 50 ng/ml IL-6 for 24 h, total extracts of DLD-1 cells were prepared and used
  to determine the phosphorylation of PI3k/AKT/mTOR. Actin was used as a loading control.
  (B) Total extracts prepared by the same methods were analyzed to determine the protein
  levels that are target gene products of STAT3 and NF-kB. Actin was used as a loading
  control. All images are representatives from at least three independent experiments.
