caption: PRMT1 deficiency promotes the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
  in 3T3-L1 cells.A, Western blot analysis of the Axin protein expression. B, protein
  levels of PRMT1, β-catenin (total), and active β-catenin at day 0, 1, and 5 were
  detected by Western blot when PRMT1 was silenced in 3T3-L1 cells. C, Western blot
  showing the relative levels of PRMT1, β-catenin (total), and active β-catenin at
  day 5 in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells with or without overexpression of PRMT1. β-Tubulin
  was used as a loading control. D, 3T3-L1 cells were transfected with siCtrl or siPRMT1
  and treated with DMSO or IWR-1, respectively. Oil red O staining was performed after
  6 days of differentiation. The scale bar represents 200 μm. E, relative absorbance
  was calculated at 510 nm as shown in (D). Values are expressed as mean ± SD (n =
  3). Student’s t test, n.s. not significance, ∗∗p < 0.01. F, the mRNA expression
  of C/EBPα, PPARγ, and FABP4 was detected by qRT-PCR at day 6 in 3T3-L1 cells transfected
  with siCtrl or siPRMT1 and treated with DMSO or IWR-1, respectively. Data are presented
  as mean ± SD (n = 3). Student’s t test, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001. G,
  Western blot analysis of C/EBPα, PPARγ, FABP4, β-catenin (total), and active β-catenin
  at day 6 in 3T3-L1 cells transfected with siCtrl or siPRMT1 and treated with DMSO
  or IWR-1, respectively. DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; qRT-PCR, quantitative RT-PCR.
