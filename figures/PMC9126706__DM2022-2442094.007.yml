caption: 'Upregulated PCAT19 inhibited the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway.
  (a, b) Western blotting was performed to detect the expressions of MAPK signaling
  pathway-associated proteins (p-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, p-p38, p-JNK, and JNK) in A549 cells.
  (c, d) Western blotting was conducted to determine the expressions of MAPK signaling
  pathway-associated proteins (p-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, p-p38, p-JNK, and JNK) in SK-MES-1
  cells. (e) The ratios of MAPK signaling pathway-related proteins were determined
  in A549 cells. (f) The ratio of MAPK signaling pathway-related proteins was determined
  in SK-MES-1 cells. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. NC; ##P < 0.01, ###P
  < 0.001 vs. siNC. Abbreviations: JNK: c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAPK: mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; qRT-PCR: quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction; NC: negative
  control.'
