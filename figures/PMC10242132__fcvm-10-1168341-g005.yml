caption: 'Immunohistochemical results of the expression of MAFbx and murf-1 proteins
  in the myocardium and skeletal muscle of rats. (A) Staining of MAFbx and Murf-1
  in the myocardium and skeletal muscle. (B) Changes in MAFbx protein expression in
  the myocardium. (C) Changes in Murf-1 protein expression in the myocardium. (D)
  Changes in MAFbx protein expression in the skeletal muscle. (E) Changes in Murf-1
  protein expression in the skeletal muscle. Compared with the sham-operated group,
  ##P < 0.01. Compared with model group, **P < 0.01.'
