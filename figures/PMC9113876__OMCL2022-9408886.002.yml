caption: Genetic alteration landscape of ferroptosis regulators in lower-grade glioma.
  (a) The outline diagram of ferroptosis potential index (FPI) calculation regulated
  by positive components and negative components. (b) The Metascape pathway enrichment
  visualization of the 24 ferroptosis regulators showed the interactions among the
  enriched terms. (c) 14 of 506 LGG patients showed genomic mutations of 24 ferroptosis
  regulators, with a frequency of 2.77%, including missense mutations, in frame deletions,
  nonsense mutations, and multihits. (d) The bar plot represents the amplification
  (red) or deletion (blue) percent of the 24 FRGs in TCGA-LGG cohort. (e) The circle
  plot represents the locations of the 24 FRGs in the human chromosomes. (f) Comparison
  analysis showed the expression levels of 24 FRGs between human normal brain tissues
  from GTEx database and LGG samples from TCGA database. The labelled asterisk indicated
  the statistical p value (ns p > 0.05 and ∗∗∗p < 0.001).
