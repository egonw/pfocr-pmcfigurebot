caption: Metabolite profiles identified in GN2 (salt-tolerant) and GN18 (salt-sensitive)
  seeds with 24 h treatments involving water (CK) and 200 mM salt solution (salt treatment,
  M). (A) PCA of metabolomic profiles with quality control in positive and negative
  ionization modes. Overall score plot of seed samples collected at GN2 (CK-2 vs.
  M-2) and GN18 (CK-18 vs. M-18). (B) Circular diagram of all metabolites in the different
  groups, showing, from the outer circle to the inner circle, the metabolites of GN2
  and GN18, respectively. (C) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was performed for all
  identified metabolites.
