caption: Expression profile of SlInR in different tissues and effect of bovine insulin
  injection on gene expression of insulin signaling pathway. (A) qPCR analysis of
  SlInR expression levels in different tissues from one-day-old adult females. (B)
  The expression of insulin signaling pathway genes was detected 24 h after bovine
  insulin injection by qRT-PCR. Results are represented as means ± SD of three independent
  samples and samples are normalized to SlRPL10 expression levels. Different lowercase
  letters represent significant differences of SlInR levels among various tissues
  determined by one-way ANOVA. Statistically significant difference between the PBS
  and bovine insulin injection groups (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01, Student’s t-test).
