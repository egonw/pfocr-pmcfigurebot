caption: KEGG Pathview analysis of molecular signature of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling
  pathway, (a) Pathview analysis of siSIRT1 group compared to Control group; (b) Pathview
  analysis of NLRP3 reconstituted group compared to NLRP3 KO group; KEGG pathway analysis
  demonstrating upregulation or downregulation of multiple components of the complement
  pathway. Each box was one gene; the green boxes show the downregulated gene expression
  of mRNA while the red boxes show the upregulated gene expression.
