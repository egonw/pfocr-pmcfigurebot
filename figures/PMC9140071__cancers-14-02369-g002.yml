caption: UC.145 regulates the phenotype of gastric cancer (GC) cells. (a) Cell viability
  was determined using the WST-1 assay in AGS and MKN74 cells transfected with siControl
  (siCT), siUC.145 (si1, si2), or siUC.145 + pcDNA-UC.145 (si1 + pcDNA, si2 + pcDNA).
  Growth curves were compared for transfected cells. (b) The colony formation assay
  was performed after AGS and MKN74 cells were transfected with siUC.145. (c) Apoptosis
  was induced by suppressing UC.145 expression using siRNA, measured by flow cytometry
  using PI/Annexin V staining. Bar graphs show the percentage of apoptotic cells in
  each population. (d) To analyze cell cycle changes, AGS and MKN74 cells were transfected
  with siRNA and analyzed by flow cytometry using PI staining. Bar graphs show the
  percentage of cells in the lower G0, G1, S, and G2 stages in siRNA-transfected cell
  populations. Wound healing assays (e) and invasion assays (f) were performed with
  AGS and MKN74 cells after UC.145 knockdown by siUC.145. Bar graphs represent the
  frequency of wound closures, number of invading cells, and colonies formed. Data
  are shown as mean ± SD of three independent experiments (* p ≤ 0.05; ** p ≤ 0.01).
