caption: Silencing of RBM8A inhibits the proliferation and promotes the apoptosis
  of breast cancer (BC) cells. (a) The proliferation of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells
  was determined by EdU assay. (b) The apoptosis of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells was
  analyzed by flow cytometry assay. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. sh-NC. Each experiment
  was repeated three times.
