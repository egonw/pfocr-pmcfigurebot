caption: PMF increases glutamine metabolism by increasing GLS1 expression. (A) GSEA
  demonstrated that PMF significantly enriched and increased the expression of genes
  involved in “GO REGULATION GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR SIGNALING PATHWAY” gene set. (B) LAMA84
  and K562 cells were treated with free PM at indicated concentration for 24 h, then
  cells were harvested for western blotting analysis with anti GLS1 antibody. GAPDH
  served as the total protein loading control. (C) Primary leukemia cells of spleen
  from CML mice were treated with free PM at indicated concentrations for 24 h, then
  cells were harvested for mRNA examination with RT-PCR and western blotting analysis
  with anti Gls1 antibody, Gapdh served as the total protein loading control. (D)
  On day 14 post BMT, CML mice were treated with Placebo or PMF (10 mg/kg, n = 3,
  each group) for 24 h. LSCs were sorted by FACS and Gls1 expression was examined
  with cellular immunofluorescence, and nucleus was stained with DAPI. (E) A schematic
  diagram of glutaminolysis and TCA cycle. (F) K562 cells were treated with free PM
  at different concentration for 24 h, the contents of glutamate, α-ketoglutarate
  and Succinyl-CoA contents in cells were measured with LC-MS/MS. (G–I) CML mice treated
  with PMF (10 mg/kg) for 24 h, the contents of glutamate, α-ketoglutarate and Succinyl-CoA
  in the spleen were measured with LC-MS/MS. The relative content was normalized to
  that in Placebo treated mice. Results were represented with the mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05,
  and **P < 0.01 were considered as significant difference.
