caption: BMSC‐Exos alleviates obesity, metabolic disorders, and inflammation in HDF‐fed
  mice. (A–O) C57BL/6 mice were given either NCD or HDF for 12 weeks. Mice with HDF
  were given 50 μg of BMSC‐Exos by intraperitoneal injection every 3 days in the last
  4 weeks. Equal amounts of NS were administered intraperitoneally to NCD and HDF
  mice as control. (A) Body weight change (n = 6 per group). (B) Last count of body
  weight of each group of mice before sampling (n = 6 per group). (C) Mean daily food
  intake per mouse in the HDF‐NS and HDF‐exosome groups during the injection of BMSC‐Exos
  exosomes. (D) Weight of iWAT and scWAT as a percentage of body weight for each group
  of mice (n = 6 per group). (E, F) Glucose tolerance test (GTT) and statistics of
  the relative area under the curve (n = 6 per group). (G, H) Insulin tolerance test
  (ITT) and statistics of the relative area under the curve (n = 6 per group). (I–K)
  iWAT and scWAT H&E staining and corresponding area statistics for each group (bars = 100 μm).
  (L–N) Protein and mRNA levels of iWAT obesity‐related genes (Leptin and FABP4) in
  various groups of mice (n = 3 per group). (O) mRNA levels of iWAT inflammation‐related
  genes (IL‐6 and TNF‐α) in all groups of mice (n = 3 per group). The error bars indicate
  the SEM, whereas comparisons between two groups were performed by an unpaired Student's
  test, *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. NCD‐NS, normal diet mice injected with
  normal saline; HDF‐NS, high‐fat‐fed mice injected with normal saline; HDF + Exosome,
  high‐fat‐fed mice injected with exosome.
