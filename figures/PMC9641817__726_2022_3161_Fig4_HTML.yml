caption: 'Dysbalance in tryptophan (Trp) metabolism promotes atherosclerosis. Gut
  dysbiosis increases the production of indoxyl sulfate which may contribute to atherogenesis.
  Absence of microbiota promotes Trp involvement in the kynurenine pathway. BMDMs
  process Trp via IDO1 into Kyn metabolites. The decreased release of IL-10 has a
  pro-atherogenic effect. Accumulation of CD4+ T cells is crucial for the progression
  of atherosclerosis and is promoted by Trp. pDCs are known for their protective role
  in atherosclerosis by inhibiting CD4+ T cell proliferation. Abbreviations: BMDM
  bone marrow-derived macrophage, CD cluster of differentiation, IDO1 indolamine-2,3-dioxygenase-1,
  IL interleukin, Kyn kynurenine, pDC plasmacytoid dendritic cell, Trp tryptophan'
