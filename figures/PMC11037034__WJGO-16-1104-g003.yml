caption: 'Tumorigenic properties of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis
  in early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Microorganisms play an important role
  in early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), and people with low esophageal
  microbial richness and salivary microbial diversity may be more likely to progress
  to esophageal squamous dysplasia (a precursor to ESCC) and ESCC. Fusobacterium nucleatum
  promoted the early progression of ESCC by upregulating the expression of IL-32/PRTN3
  and activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae
  upregulates TLR4/MyD88 expression, which in turn activates GARP-mediated TGFÎ²/Smad
  signaling, thereby promoting the occurrence and development of ESCC. Fn: Fusobacterium
  nucleatum; Pg: Porphyromonas gingivalis; FimA: Fimbriae. Citation: The figure was
  created by author using MedPeer. The authors have obtained the permission for figure
