caption: 'DEC1 expression is positively correlated with H. pylori infection status
  and the progression of GC. A. GEO RNA sequencing database analysis of the DEC1 expression
  in H. pylori‐infected gastric cells. The data were derived from the GSE00262 and
  GSE70394. B. qRT‐PCR results of cells co‐cultured with H. pylori for 4h, 8h and
  12h. C. DEC1 protein expression after co‐cultured with H. pylori especially at 8h
  time point. D. DEC1 immunohistochemical stain of GC with or without H. Pylori. Magnification:
  40×. E. Associations between DEC1 expression levels and clinicopathological characteristics
  of H. pylori‐positive GC. F. Survival analysis of DEC1 expression in H. pylori‐positive
  GC. All data are presented as mean±standard deviation of at least three independent
  experiments. Statistic process: t‐test, chi‐square or Fisher exact tests. *p < 0.05'
article_title: DEC1 promotes progression of Helicobacter pylori‐positive gastric cancer
  by regulating Akt/NF‐κB pathway.
