caption: Photomicrograph of the liver tissues stained with MT stain. (A) NC group
  showing normal deposition of collagenous fibers in the portal areas. (B,C) CCl4
  group showing marked collagenous fibrous bridging with excessive collagen fibers
  deposition from portal to central areas and from central to central areas grade
  5 (arrows). (D,E) CCl4+ D-carvone group showing marked diminution of collagen fibers
  deposition and distribution from portal to portal areas. (F) D-carvone group showing
  normal collagen fibers spreading around portal area.
