caption: 'Proposed model for the three major mechanisms of PD-L1 activation. (1) The
  extrinsic mechanism: tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and NK cells produce IFN-γ.
  Then, IFN-γ signals through the interferon-gamma–JAK1/JAK2–STAT1/STAT2/STAT3–IRF1
  axis, resulting in binding of the IRF1 transcription factor to the PD-L1 promoter
  (ISREs and GASS). (2) The intrinsic mechanism: (A) the PD-L1 protein is up-regulated
  through EGFR/RAS/MAPK pathway activation. Wild-type EGFR activates PD-L1 through
  the JAK2/STAT1 pathway, whereas mutant EGFR/RAS may induce stronger MAPK pathway
  activation and STAT3 pathways then activate promotor. Also MAPK signaling increases
  the stability of CD274 mRNA. (B) Functional loss of tumor-suppressive genes, such
  as PTEN, results in activation of PI3Kinase, then activation of the AKT pathway
  (3) 9p24.1 gene amplicon amplification. The PD-1 ligand genes, PD-L1 and PD-L2,
  are located on chromosome 9p24.1. A 9p copy gain has been described in Hodgkin’s
  lymphoma and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (MLBCL). The amplification
  region also included the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) locus. This gene amplification is
  also described in carcinoma of the lung uterine cervical squamous cell carcinoma
  and triple-negative breast carcinoma. (Permission to modify the original figure
  (J. Pathol. 2019, 249, 52–64) was obtained from Dr. Jong.).'
