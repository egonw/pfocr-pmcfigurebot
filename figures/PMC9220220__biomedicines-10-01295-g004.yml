caption: 'The impact of Rapa-ADMSC administration on Akt/pAkt and mTOR expressions
  at 10 days after cisplatin injection. (A) the products of western blotting of the
  tested genes, lane 1 = control group, lane 2 = Cis group, lane 3 = Rapa + ADMSC
  group and lane 4 = ADMSC group, (B) pAkt/Akt ratio and (C) mTOR expression in different
  studied groups. * Significant vs. control, # significant vs. Cis group and $ significant
  vs. ADMSC group.'
