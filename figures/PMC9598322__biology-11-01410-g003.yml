caption: Role of mitochondria and lysosomes in HSC maintenance. The metabolic mechanisms
  that aid in HSC self-renewal, differentiation, and glycolysis fuel the metabolic
  pathway for active HSCs. In the glycolysis pathway, glucose is degraded into glucose-6P,
  which undergoes a series of reactions and is converted to pyruvate. Pyruvate generates
  energy for active HSCs in the TCA cycle. Simultaneously, the production of nucleotides
  like purine and pyrimidine also requires glucose-6P and utilizes in the pentose
  phosphate pathway, which is critical for cell proliferation and activating HSCs
  adapted with permission []. Alternatively, HSCs are activated by unknown mechanisms
  byproducts such as amino acids (AAs), or other nutrients release from the lysosomes
  may be shuttled to the mitochondria from the cytosol, where they are converted to
  acetyl-CoA and enter the TCA cycle to produce ATP. HSCs are activated when TCA cycle
  is activated by alpha-ketoglutarate (α-KG), the end product of glutamine in the
  mitochondria. Instead of using glucose for energy generation, the catabolism of
  branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) also feeds the TCA cycle through α-KG to produce
  ATP. FAO, a crucial ATP-producing catabolic pathway, feeds the TCA cycle rather
  than glycolysis. Long-chain fatty acids are converted into short chain fatty acyl-CoA
  in the cytosol and subsequently transported by carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1
  (CPT1), carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase
  (CPT2) into the mitochondria through carnitine pathway. Here, β-oxidation yields
  acetyl-CoA to drive the TCA cycle adapted with permission []. FAO is vital to HSC
  maintenance. Created with BioRender.com 21 September 2022.
