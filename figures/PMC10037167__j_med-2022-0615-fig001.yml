caption: Differentially expressed genes in GSE73953 dataset. (a) Volcano map of differentially
  expressed genes in GSE73953 dataset. Fold change represents the degree of gene upregulation
  or downregulation in the dataset, while the dash-dotted lines are used to distinguish
  the genes (|logFC| > 1). p < 0.05. (b) Heat map of differentially expressed genes
  in GSE73953 dataset. G1 group represents the peripheral blood mononuclear cells
  from 16 healthy controls, while G2 group refers to peripheral blood mononuclear
  cells from eight membranous nephropathy patients. Each row denotes different samples
  in G1 and G2 groups, and each column represents differential genes in the G1 and
  G2 group.
