caption: 'The PI3K pathway: normal and cancerous conditions and targeted agents. (A)
  Under normal conditions, the PI3K pathway contributes to the regulation of cell
  growth, proliferation, and survival via receptor tyrosine kinases including HER2
  leading to downstream activation of AKT and mTOR complexes. (B) Inappropriate/excessive
  activation of the pathway caused by HER2 amplification, PIK3CA alteration, and/or
  PTEN loss-of-function can contribute to the formation of breast cancer via dysregulated
  cell growth, proliferation, and survival. (C) Pharmacologic agents targeting the
  PI3K pathway include PI3K, mTOR, and dual PI3/mTOR inhibitors. HER2, human epidermal
  growth factor receptor 2; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol diphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate;
  PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog.'
