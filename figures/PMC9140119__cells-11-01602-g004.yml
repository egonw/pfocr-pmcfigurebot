caption: The survival rates and fecundity of silencing MEK, ERK, KSR2, and P38 in
  female C. bowringi. (A) Survival curves of adult female beetles resulting from key
  gene silencing were generated using the KM survival estimate (n = 37–56). The log-rank
  test was used to compare the significance of knocking down each key gene to the
  dsGFP control. (B) Total and daily egg production per female after dsRNA injection
  was measured throughout the adult stage of the cabbage beetles (n = 17–56). All
  data were recorded daily and presented as mean ± SD. The significance of key gene
  treatments was determined using independent t-tests in comparison to the dsGFP control,
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.
