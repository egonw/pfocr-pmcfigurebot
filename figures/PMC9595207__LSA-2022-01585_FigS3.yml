figure_title: Sensitivity of TFR and GLUT4 to PI3K/Akt inhibition and the identification
  of TRARG1 interactors
caption: (A) Insulin stimulated GLUT4 (upper) and TfR (lower) responses of cells expressing
  HA-GLUT4-mRuby3 in the presence of insulin signalling pathway inhibitors. The surface
  labelling with HA was quantified and expressed as a proportion of the total GLUT4
  (mRuby3) signal in response to 0.5 and 100 nM insulin. Cells were treated with the
  inhibitors torin, wortmannin, MK2206, or GDC0068 and GLUT4 responses were expressed
  relative to the DMSO control. Data are presented as mean ± SEMb. n = 7. (B) Representative
  Western blotting of TRARG1 immunoprecipitation in control and insulin stimulated
  cells. (C) Volcano plot of TRARG1 interactome under basal (Bas) or insulin-stimulated
  (INS) conditions (left)—TRARG1 interactors regulated by insulin treatment (highlighted
  in blue) as identified by median absolute deviation analysis (4.22.2.); and correlation
  plot of TRARG1 interactor enrichment under basal (Bas) and insulin (Ins) treated
  conditions (right). (D) Bcl9l expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes after treatment with
  non-targeting siRNA (NT) or siRNA targeting Bcl9l. Data expressed as mean ± SD,
  n = 2–4. (D, E) Western blotting of cell lysates for Bcl9l and α-tubulin under the
  same conditions as in (D).
