caption: Association testing of ASD phenotypes using ASD-SV markers(A) Manhattan plot
  of association testing of verbal versus non-verbal phenotype using presence/absence
  markers of ASD-SVs at 10,108 loci found two significant ASD-SVs after Bonferroni
  correction (p < 5 x 10-6, red line).(B) The most significant association (OR = 2.3)
  resides in an FOS transcription factor binding site that regulates the ACMSD gene,
  which codes for a key enzyme in the kynurenic acid pathway. Altered levels of quinolinic
  acid and picolinic acid of this tryptophan catabolic pathway have been associated
  with several neuropsychiatric disorders including ASD, and an SNP in this gene has
  been linked to suicidal behavior. The metabolites kynurenic acid and quinolinic
  acid in this pathway inhibit glutamate signaling via numerous receptor types, one
  of which (NMDAR) is a therapeutic target for the treatment of ASD. Created with
