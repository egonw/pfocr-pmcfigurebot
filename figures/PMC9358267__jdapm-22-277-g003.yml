figure_title: 'Western blot analysis was conducted to analyze the protein expression
  of COX-2 and PGE2, in WISH cells were treated with DEX (0.001 – 1 µg/mL) and/or
  1 µg/mL LPS. The effect of DEX and LPS co-treatment on the protein expression of
  COX-2 and PGE2 were evaluated. Relative density analysis was performed using NIH
  Image program and normalized to that of α-tubulin. Data are presented as mean ±
  standard deviation of three independent experiments. #P < 0.05 versus control group;
  *P < 0.05 versus LPS group. COX, cyclooxygenase; DEX, dexmedetomidine; LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  PGE, prostaglandin. DEX, dexmedetomidine; LPS, lipopolysaccharide'
