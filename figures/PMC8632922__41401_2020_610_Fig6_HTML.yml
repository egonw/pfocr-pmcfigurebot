figure_title: Differential responses to DTX and differential metabolic phenotypes
  in sensitive and resistant cells
caption: 'a Mean tumor volumes on different days. Tumor volume was calculated as (length×width2)/2.
  b The PLS-DA model of the tumors in different groups (SC:A549 tumor with vehicle
  treatment; SD: A549 tumor with DTX treatment; RC: A549/DTX tumor with vehicle treatment;
  RD: A549/DTX tumor with DTX treatment) (PC1: R2X (cum) = 0.246, R2Y (cum) = 0.23,
  Q2 (cum) = 0.171; PC2: R2X (cum) = 0.365, R2Y (cum) = 0.407, Q2 (cum) = 0.268).
  c Accumulation of DTX in A549 and A549/DTX tumors. d Accumulation of DTX in the
  plasma of A549 or A549/DTX tumor-bearing mice. e mRNA levels of P-gp in A549 and
  A549/DTX tumors. f Protein levels of P-gp in A549 and A549/DTX tumors. The experiments
  were performed three times with similar results. g GSH and cystine levels in A549
  and A549/DTX tumors. h Protein levels of key enzymes in the GSH synthesis pathway
  in A549 and A549/DTX tumors. The experiments were performed three times with similar
  results. Unpaired t test with equal variance. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
  Data represent the mean ± SEM, n = 5.'
