caption: mRNA gene expression following provocation over time. Gene expression estimates
  are expressed as mean −ΔCt values (decrease in the value by a unit means a 2‐fold
  decrease in gene expression) with the whiskers indicating 95% confidence intervals.
  MET, methacholine provocation; NAS, intranasal provocation
article_title: New insights into the regulation of TGF‐β/Smad and MPK signaling pathway
  gene expressions by nasal allergen and methacholine challenge test in asthma.
