figure_title: SMAD4 nuclear translocation in CD8+ T cells is triggered by TCR signaling
caption: '(A) Expression levels of SMAD4 in cytoplasm and nucleus between naive and
  activated CD8+ T cells by Western blotting. Cytoplasmic and nuclear protein was
  extracted from naive and in vitro activated CD8+ T cells. The cells were activated
  by αCD3/CD28 for 24 to 48 hours. Cyt, cytoplasm; Nuc, nucleus; n, naive; a, activated;
  GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. (B) Subcellular localization of
  SMAD4 in naive and αCD3/CD28 activated CD8+ T cells (in the presence of DMSO control,
  Itk inhibitor, PI3K inhibitor, Lck inhibitor, and combination of Lck/Itk inhibitors,
  respectively). The cells were collected, spun down to a cytospin microscope slide,
  and fixed and stained with αSMAD4 followed by staining with Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated
  secondary antibody. The results shown here represent the merged photos of SMAD4
  (green) and 4′ (green) andcondary antibod (DAPI) (blue; indicated for nuclear location)
  staining. Scale bars, 10 μm. Right: Statistic data of SMAD4 nuclear translocation
  ratio, which was determined by manually counting the percentage of cells containing
  higher SMAD4 staining intensity in the nucleus versus cytoplasm in three representative
  fields revealed by Image-Pro Plus software. (C) Subcellular localization of SMAD4
  in αCD3/CD28 activated CD8+ T cells in the presence of DMSO control, p38α/β inhibitor,
  c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1/2 inhibitor, MEK1/2 inhibitor, and ERK1/2 inhibitor, respectively.
  All the groups were added TGF-β receptor inhibitor. These experiments were repeated
  two or three times with consistent results. The statistics were performed by Student’s
  t test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ****P < 0.0001.'
