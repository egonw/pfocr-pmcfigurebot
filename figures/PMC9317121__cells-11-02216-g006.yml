caption: Runx2 and Osx expression patterns in developing teeth. Runx2 mRNA was clearly
  detected in dental and osteogenic mesenchyme from E14 to E16. Its expression was
  intense in osteogenic mesenchymal cells, whereas expression was downregulated in
  odontoblasts, ameloblasts, and dental pulp cells at E18 of the mandibular incisor
  and first molar. At this stage, Osx expression mostly overlapped with Runx2 expression
  from E14â€“E16. At E18, its expression was prominent in ameloblasts, odontoblasts,
  and dental pulp cells. From PN 1 to PN 14, Runx2 mRNA was detected in osteogenic
  mesenchyme and remarkedly downregulated in ameloblasts, odontoblasts, and dental
  pulp cells. In contrast, Osx expression continued to be present in osteogenic mesenchyme,
  odontoblasts, dental pulp cells, and periodontal ligament cells. ab, alveolar bone;
