caption: p-TBC1D1Ser660 promoted FZD7 membranal localization and inhibited FZD7 lysosomal
  degradation. A Screening the incorporable FZDs with TBC1D1 by immunoprecipitation
  assay. B The inosculation between TBC1D1 and FZD7 was detected with or without pseudo-phosphorylated
  mutant type plasmids of TBC1D1 at Ser660 site transfection. C Western blot analysis
  was conducted to evaluate the effect of TBC1D1 Ser660 phosphorylation or silencing
  on the expression of FZD7. D, E Cycloheximide (CHX)-chase assay showing the effects
  of pseudo-phosphorylated (D) or nonphosphorylatable (E) plasmids of TBC1D1 at Ser660
  site on the decline of FZD7 in PC cells. Data represent mean ± SD of three independent
  experiments and were analyzed by two-sided unpaired Student’s t-test, *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01. F–I Western blot analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of TBC1D1
  on FZD7 expression in the absence and presence of lysosomal inhibitors chloroquine
  (F) and NH4Cl (G), autophagy inhibitor 3-MA (H) and proteasome inhibitor MG132 (I).
