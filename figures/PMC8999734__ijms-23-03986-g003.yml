caption: 'Loratadine specifically targets TAK-1 to exert anti-inflammatory activity.
  (a) HEK293T cells were transfected with AP-1-luc, HA-TAK-1, and β-galactosidase
  (control) using PEI for 24 h. Cells were treated with the indicated doses of Loratadine
  (30–40 μM) for 1 h. The expression level of AP-1 was assessed by measuring luciferase
  activity. (b) HEK293T cells were transfected with TAK1 using PEI for 24 h and treated
  with Loratadine (40 μM) for 1 h after transfection. The binding affinity of TAK-1
  and Loratadine was evaluated using the cellular thermal shift assay at the indicated
  temperatures. (c) HEK293T cells were transfected with HA-TAK-1-WT or HA-TAK-1-K63A
  constructs using PEI for 24 h and treated with Loratadine (40 μM) for 1 h and whole-cell
  lysates were prepared. The expression levels of total or phosphorylated TAK-1, MKK7,
  HA, and β-actin (control) were measured through Western blotting analysis. (Bottom
  panel of c) Relative intensity of these proteins was calculated by ImageJ. ## p
  < 0.01 compared to the normal group; ** p < 0.01 compared to the control group.
  Data are presented as mean ± the standard deviation of experiments performed with
  4–6 samples. WCL: whole cell lysate.'
