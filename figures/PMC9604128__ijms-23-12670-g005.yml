caption: RNA-seq analysis of angiogenic effect on osteogenesis. Total RNA was extracted
  from BMSCs co-cultured with HUVECs on MBG-NH2, MBG-NH2/IGF and MBG-NH2/IGF@SF/VEGF
  scaffolds. (A) General heatmap of all the differentially expressed genes. (B–D)
  Volcano plots of all the differentially expressed genes between MBG-NH2/IGF and
  MBG-NH2 scaffolds (B), MBG-NH2/IGF@SF/VEGF and MBG-NH2 scaffolds (C), and MBG-NH2/IGF@SF/VEGF
  and MBG-NH2/IGF scaffolds (D). Increased expression genes are indicated by red dots,
  while decreased expression genes are indicated by green dots. (E–I) Enrichment plots
  of GSEA analysis showing the KEGG Notch signaling pathway between MBG-NH2/IGF@SF/VEGF
  and MBG-NH2 (E), the KEEG TGF-β signaling pathway between MBG-NH2/IGF@SF/VEGF and
  MBG-NH2 (F), the KEEG MAPK signaling pathway between MBG-NH2/IGF@SF/VEGF and MBG-NH2/IGF
  (G), the KEEG Notch signaling pathway between MBG-NH2/IGF@SF/VEGF and MBG-NH2/IGF
  (H), and the KEEG TGF-β signaling pathway between MBG-NH2/IGF@SF/VEGF and MBG-NH2/IGF
  (I). (J) Partial heatmap of the differentially expressed genes associated with bone
  development, bone mineralization, bone morphogenesis and bone remodeling in MBG-NH2/IGF@SF/VEGF
  and MBG-NH2. (K) mRNA levels of Csf1r and Grem1. (L) Interaction networks and functional
  enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes associated with bone development,
  bone mineralization, bone morphogenesis and bone remodeling between MBG-NH2/IGF@SF/VEGF
  and MBG-NH2 in (J). (M) Partial heatmap of the differentially expressed genes associated
  with bone development, bone mineralization, bone morphogenesis and bone remodeling
  between MBG-NH2/IGF@SF/VEGF and MBG-NH2/IGF. (N) mRNA levels of Cthrc1 and Cited2.
  Experimental data were analyzed as indicated and reported as mean ±SE. (**** p <
  0.0001).
