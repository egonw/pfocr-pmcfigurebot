caption: 'Myotube transcriptome changes in LGMDD2 cells are significantly rescued
  on CRISPR-Cas9 editing(A) Volcano plot that represents differentially expressed
  genes between healthy control and LGMDD2 myotubes. Black lines indicate |log2FC| =
  1 in x axis and –log10 P-value = 1.3 in y axis, which are the fold change (FC) and
  significance (P value) thresholds for significantly differentially expressed genes.
  Dots represent downregulated (blue) or upregulated (red) genes. (B) Percentage of
  genes differentially expressed between CNT and LGMDD2 cells (regarded as disease-related
  genes [DRGs]; 2,508), whose expression did not significantly approach that in normal cells (unrecovered),
  partially recovered, totally recovered, or departed > 150% from normal values (over-recovered)
  after CRISPR editing of the mutant TNPO3. (C) Heatmap of the 729 DRGs that were
  totally recovered by CRISPR-Cas9 edition in our dataset of healthy (CNT), model
  (LGMDD2), or edited (LGMDD2 GE) cells. Differences were assigned a color according
  to the scale: red = over-expressed; blue = under-expressed. (D) Representation of
  significantly recovered pathways in the indicated conditions. Each point represents
  a significant over-represented pathway, and each column is a different comparison:
  Disease (CNT versus LGMDD2), Treatment (CNT versus LGMDD2 GE), and Specificity (in
  LGMDD2 versus LGMDD2 GE). Size represents the count of altered genes in each over-represented
  pathway, while the color denotes the significance of each over-representation in
  that pathway. Significant recovery involves that the Treatment comparison is no
  longer significantly enriched (hence lack of dots) and both Disease and Specificity
  comparisons are significantly enriched. (E) Volcano plot uses the same conventions
  as in (A) and represents differentially expressed miRNAs between healthy control
  and LGMDD2 myotubes. (F) Percentage of miRNAs unrecovered, partially recovered,
  totally recovered, or over-recovered after CRISPR editing of the mutant TNPO3.'
