caption: 'Validation of a similar signature to the one we identified on breast cancer
  patients from the Breast Invasive Carcinoma—TCGA, PanCancer dataset. (A) Kaplan–Meier
  curves and risk table displaying the comparison in terms of overall survival between
  patients with tumors with the signature “present” and those with tumors with the
  signature “absent”. (B) Kaplan–Meier curves and risk table displaying the comparison
  in terms of disease-free survival between patients with tumors with the signature
  “present” and those with tumors with the signature “absent”. Abbreviations: Sig_TAZ_YAP_SCD1:
  signature of reverse phase protein array low TAZ or YAP levels and high SCD1 levels.'
