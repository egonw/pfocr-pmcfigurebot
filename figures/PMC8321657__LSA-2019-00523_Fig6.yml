caption: The percentage of samples that are mutated per pathway are shown next to
  the pathway labels. The colors represent cancer types of the mutated samples. Cancer
  types that had <10 samples mutated are shown as Others. Samples that had regulatory
  mutations in a gene associated to the respective pathway are indicated with a bar
  line and those that had a mutation in the identified mutated elements but lacked
  direct-functionality evidence are shown as dots.
