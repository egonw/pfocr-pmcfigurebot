caption: 'PEDF regulates autophagy via the AMPK/ULK1 signaling pathway in NSCLC cells.
  (A and B) Western blotting was used to determine the expression of AMPK, p-AMPK,
  PI3K, and MAPK. PEDF downregulates total and p-AMPK, which could be reversed by
  AMPK-overexpressing lentiviral delivery to cells; n=4. (C and D) Protein levels
  of ULK1, p62, LC3-I, and LC3-II in NSCLC cells treated with PEDF-LVs with or without
  AMPK overexpression lentivirus; n=4. (E) Protein levels of TSC and mTOR treated
  with PEDF-LVs with or without AMPK overexpression lentivirus; n=4. (F) The number
  of cells cultured for 72–120 h with PEDF-LVs with or without AMPK-LVs intervention
  was assessed; n=4. (G) Cell viability assay; n=3. **P<0.01 vs. the control group;
  and ##P<0.01 vs. the PEDF-LVs group. PEDF, pigment epithelium-derived factor; AMPK,
  adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated protein kinase; ULK1, Unc-51 like autophagy-activated
  kinase 1; NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer; p-, phosphorylated; PKCα, anti-protein
  kinase C α; LC3, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3; LV, lentivirus.'
