caption: Western blotting of SVZ tissues post‐TBI. (A) MiR‐124‐3p affected the expression
  of neurotrophin signaling pathway molecules after TBI. Western blot (WB) analysis
  of Akt3, PIK3CA, Ras, phospho‐Akt, phospho‐PI3K, phospho‐MEK1/2, and phospho‐Erk1/2
  expression in SVZ tissues of TBI rats injected with agomir‐124‐3p or antagomir‐124‐3p
  5 and 7 days after injury. (B) Statistical analysis of the relative protein expression
  of each molecule. All proteins analyzed were found to be significantly differentially
  expressed between the agomir group and antagomir group. (C) The expression of NT‐3,
  BDNF, and DCX in the SVZ tissue was tested 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after TBI. (D) Statistical
  analysis of the relative protein expression of each molecule. All data are presented
  as the means ± SD. ⁎p < 0.05. n = 3/group. Full length western blot scans for the
  cropped images are presented in Figure

  stem cell activation by enhancing the function of BDNF downstream pathways after
  traumatic brain injury in adult rats.
