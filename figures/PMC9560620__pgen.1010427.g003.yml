figure_title: Hh pathway requirement for gland specification
caption: (A-H) Embryos of various genotypes labelled with sna-rg-GFP (green) to mark
  the gland primordia. (A) Wild type embryo labelling the CA and PG location. (B)
  hhAC null and (C) enE null embryos show almost complete downregulation of the sna-rg
  enhancer (asterisks). (D) ci94 null embryos show normal sna-rg activation. (E) Double
  enE, ci94 mutants recover sna-rg expression in the CA and PG primordia. (F) Overexpression
  of the Ci repressor isoform with spalt-Gal4 downregulates sna-rg expression (asterisk
  marks the approximate position where stage 13 migrating primordia should be expected).
  (G) Overexpression of the Ci activator isoform with sal-Gal4 results in an expansion
  of sna-rg expression. (H) Double wgCX4, hhAC mutant embryos lack sna-rg expression
  (asterisks). (I) Model summarising regulatory interactions between the Wnt and Hh
  pathways and the sna-rg enhancer (The interactions represented are not assumed to
  be direct). Panels D-E were also stained with anti-Ci, panel E with anti-En and
  panel H with anti-Wg to identify the mutant embryos. All embryos are at st11 except
  F and G which are at st13 and st12. Scale bar 50 μm.
