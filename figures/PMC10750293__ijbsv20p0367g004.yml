caption: Rebalancing TGF-β/PGE2 towards PGE2 polarization promoted DC cytoskeletal
  reorganization. (A) U14 cells were incubated with tumor secretions for 24 h post-RT.
  The supernatant was collected and cocultured with DCs in the presence or absence
  of TGF-β/PGE2 receptor antagonists. The organization of microfilaments and microtubules
  in DCs was observed by staining the F-actin and β-tubulin. (B) Statistical analysis
  of the mean fluorescence intensity of microfilaments and microtubules; N = 3 views;
  *p < 0.05. (C) The formation of focal adhesions on DC20Gy/TGF-βi/ U14s stained with
  an anti-paxillin antibody. (D) Activation of the MLC signaling pathway in DCs was
  assessed by western blotting. The results are presented as the relative intensity
  of the protein bands from N = 3 replicates; *p < 0.05. (E) The chemokine receptor
  expression of DCs after different treatments was detected with FACS; N = 3; *p <
  0.05.(F) Migration index was measured in transwell experiments using SDF-1 and CCL-19
  as respective ligands for CXCR4 and CCR7; N = 5, *p < 0.05. All above data are representative
  results from two or three independent experiments.
