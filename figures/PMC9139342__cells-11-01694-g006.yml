caption: Effect of anti-VEGF treatment in NSCLC cell lines. A total of 8,000 H2170-ER,
  H358-ER, H1975, and H3255 NSCLC cells were treated with diluent (control), 10 µM
  Erlotinib treatment, 200 ng/mL Avastin treatment, and a combination of 10 µM Erlotinib
  and 200 ng/mL Avastin. Cell viability was assessed with an MTT cell viability assay
  to study the efficacy of Erlotinib in conjunction with the VEGF inhibitor, Avastin,
  relative to the control. In (A) H2170-ER cells, (B) H358-ER cells, (C) H1975 cells,
  and (D) H3255 cells, cell viability was measured. Six duplicates from each cell
  line were used for each treatment group. Absorbance was recorded, and percent viability
  was calculated using appropriate controls for each sample. Statistical analysis
  was performed, and the results were found to be statistically significant (* = p
  < 0.05) by way of two-tailed t-test analysis. All treatment groups showed statistically
  significant results compared to the diluent. Treatment groups without an asterisk
  (*) did not show statistically significant results. One asterisk (*) denotes statistical
  significance in all the bars with one asterisk and two asterisks (**) suggest statistical
  significance between all the bars with two asterisks.
