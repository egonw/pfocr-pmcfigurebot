caption: 'EDA inhibited PM-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction
  in HBECs. (a) HBECs were treated with EDA in a dose-dependent manner (300, 400,
  or 500 μM) and then stimulated with 300 μg/mL PM for 24 h. The ROS level was measured
  through the fluorescent probe, DCFH-DA, and fluorescence intensity was measured
  and shown in (b). (c) Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was detected using
  JC-1 staining, and data are presented as the ratio of red fluorescence (JC-1 aggregates)
  to green fluorescence (JC-1 monomers) in (d). Values are the mean ± SEM;  ∗∗P <
  0.01, compared with the control group; #P < 0.05 or ##P < 0.01, compared with the
  PM group; n = 3. EDA: edaravone; PM: particulate matter; HBECs: human bronchial
  epithelial cells.'
