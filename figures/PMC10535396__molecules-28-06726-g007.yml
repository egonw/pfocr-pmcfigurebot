caption: 'The mRNA expression of (a) NF-κB, (b) IκB, (c) BACE1, (d) APP and (e) MAPT
  in NF-κB/IκB signaling pathway. Control: untreated cells; H2O2: cells induced with
  300 μM hydrogen peroxide for 4 h; PMEE+H2O2: cells pre-treated with PMEE for 48
  h + 4 h exposure to H2O2; CUR+H2O2: cells pre-treated with curcumin for 48 h + 4
  h exposure to H2O2; PMEE: cells treated with only PMEE; CUR: cells treated with
  only curcumin. The value represents fold changes between control (untreated cells)
  and treatment groups. Data were expressed as the mean ± SD of triplicate experiments;
  means with different letters denote significant differences with one another and
  vice versa (p < 0.05).'
