caption: cGAS-STING pathway deficiency impairs the expression of cancer stem cell
  markers. (A–D) The ratio of CD24+ and CD44+ populations in NC, cGAS- or STING-knockout
  HeLa cells detected by FACS. Scatter spots of CD24+ or CD44+ cells showed in left
  panels (A, C) while quantification of results showed in right panels (B, D). (E,
  F) Representative scatter spots of FACS detecting the CD44+/CD24− population in
  NC, cGAS- or STING-knockout MCF-7 cells (E), and the results were quantified and
  showed at right (F). (G, H) Representative results and quantification of ALDH+ cells
  in NC, cGAS- or STING-depleted PANC-1 cells detected by ALDEFLOUR™ assay. Data were
  represented as mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
