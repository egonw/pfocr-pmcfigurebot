figure_title: Proposed scheme of molybdenum cofactor (Moco) catabolism and urothione-synthesizing
  activity in mouse crude protein extracts
caption: (A) The pathway involves at least two enzyme-catalyzed reactions methylation
  and dephosphorylation. The order of both reactions is unknown. Also, release of
  molybdenum, pyran ring opening and pterin oxidation, are also required for the formation
  of urothione and believed to take place in early steps of this pathway. Moco [1],
  a methylated intermediate [2], urothione [3], and Form B [4], the air oxidized product
  of Moco are shown. (B) HPLC analysis of in vitro generated urothione from mouse
  liver extract in the presence (black) and absence (gray) of SAM. (C) In vitro urothione
  synthesis using crude protein extracts (4 μg/μL) from liver, kidney and brain using
  in vitro synthesized thiopterin (2.72 μM) in the presence of 50 μM SAM. (D and E)
  Purification of urothione synthesizing activity from mice crude liver extracts using
  anion exchange and size exclusion chromatography. Fractions were taken and urothione
  synthesis was determined using in vitro synthesized molybdopterin (MPT) in the absence
  (D) and presence of alkaline phosphatase (E). Gray highlight indicates the fraction
  which was further purified (D) or analyzed for protein content (E). (F) Results
  of peptide mass finger printing derived from the sample with highest activity shown
  in panel E. (G) HPLC analysis of in vitro generated urothione from mouse liver extract
  in the presence of SAM (black) or betaine (gray).
