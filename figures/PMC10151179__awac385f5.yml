caption: ROC curves for diffusion and conventional MRI biomarkers. The figures show
  that cholinergic WM pathways outperformed other MRI biomarkers in the SCD group,
  and that all considered biomarkers performed better with a more advanced clinical
  stage of the disease in the Alzheimer’s disease continuum, in distinguishing between
  a clinical group and HC. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 (assessed using a two-tailed
  alpha). AD = Alzheimer’s disease dementia; ExCap = external capsule pathway; Cing
  = cingulum pathway; Rem WM = WM excluding cholinergic pathways; NBM vol. = volume
  of NBM scaled by TIV; hippocampus vol. = volume of hippocampus scaled by TIV.
