caption: MACP2-strengthened plant resistance relying on SA pathway to the bacterial
  pathogen. (A) Phenotypes of wild-type, MACP2-KOs, and MACP2-OEs in response to Pst
  DC3000 infection. Four-week-old wild-type, MACP2-KOs, and MACP2-OEs were infected
  with Pst DC3000 on leaf surface and photographed 5 days after treatment. (B) Bacterial
  populations at 5 days postinoculation in wild-type, MACP2-KOs, and MACP2-OEs leaves.
  The data represent means from three independent repeats. Statistical differences
  were identified using Student’s t test. ** p < 0.01. (C) SA contents detection of
  wild-type, MACP2-KO mutants, and MACP2-OEs adult plants during Pst DC3000 infection.
  The contents of SA and SAG were measured by LC-MS. The “g” in “ng/g” represents
  the fresh weight. The experiments were biologically repeated three times with similar
  results. Error bars represent SD (n = 3 biological replicates). * p < 0.05, ** p
  < 0.01 by Student’s t test. (D) Phenotypes of leaves from 4-week-old wild-type,
  MACP2-OE, eds1-22, and MACP2-OE eds1-22 leaves in response to Pst DC3000 infection.
  (E) Bacterial populations at 5 days postinoculation in wild-type, MACP2-OE, eds1-22,
  and MACP2-OE eds1-22 leaves. The data represent means from three independent repeats.
  Statistically significant differences were identified using Student’s t test. *
  p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.
