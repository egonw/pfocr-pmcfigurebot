caption: 'miR-887-3p targeted BTBD7. (a) Venn map of the intersection of miR-887-3p
  downstream target genes predicted by RNAInter, Targetscan, and ENCORI databases.
  (b) Coexpression network of candidate genes. (c) miR-887-3p targeting site in BTBD7
  3′UTR predicted by Starbase. (d) Luciferase reporter plasmid containing BTBD7-wt
  or BTBD7-mut was transfected into 293T cells together with miR-887-3p in parallel
  with an miR-NC plasmid vector. (e) Enrichment of miR-887-3p on the BTBD7 was detected
  by RNA pull down assay, relative to antisense-oligos. (f) ECORI Pan-Cer assessed
  the BTBD7 expression in normal tissues and primary tumors. Relative BTBD7 mRNA expression
  (g) and protein level (h) in MCF-7, BT474, and HCC1937 cells were determined by
  RT-qPCR and western blot analysis under MDA-MB-231-derived EV treatment. The miR-887-3p
  was normalized to U6 while the BTBD7 was normalized to GAPDH. Data are expressed
  as the mean ± standard deviation. One-way ANOVA and Tukey''s multiple comparison
  test were used. ∗p < 0.05 and∗∗p < 0.01. Three independent experiments were performed.
  BC: breast cancer; miR: microRNA; wt: wild type; mut: mutant type; RT-qPCR: reverse
  transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction; BTBD7: BTB domain containing
