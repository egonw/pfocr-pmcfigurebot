caption: SorCS1 localization and signaling relevant to AD. SorCS1 localization is
  restricted to cell soma and dendrites. Box A) SorCS1 forms homodimers, but also
  heterodimers with Sortilin via SorCS1 prodomain, and with SorCS2/3. Box B) SorCS1
  binds APP in vesicular compartments; however, SorCS1 variants control APP sorting
  in different manner. While SorCS1b mediates APP trafficking towards PM, SorCS1c
  blocks it. Box C) SorCS1 binds TrkB, which inhibits TrkB activation by BDNF stimulation.
  SorCS1 might be responsible (marked “?”) for TrkB sorting between TGN, PM and recycling
  pathway. Box D) This figure schematizes the possible consequences of SorCS1 loss
  and gain of function. In homeostatic state (middle panel), SorCS1 binds APP and
  the retromer complex via its VPS35 subunit. This protein complex is internalized
  and later recycled into TGN. SorCS1c remains in complex with APP and retromer, which
  retains APP in TGN, and subsequently regulates its cleavage by BACE1 and γ-secretase.
  This way SorCS1 could control the physiological levels of secreted sAPPβ and Aβ.
  The abortion of SorCS1c-VPS35 interaction (left panel) enhances the APP anterograde
  trafficking causing an increased production and release of neurotoxic Aβ and sAPPβ.
  SorCS1 overexpression (OE; right panel) seems to strengthen the APP retention in
  TGN, thus significantly reducing the production and secretion of Aβ and sAPPβ, which
  has a neuroprotective effect against the formation of Aβ oligomers. Box E) SorCS1
  is a substrate for PSEN1/2 and ADAM17, which attenuates its protein levels. However,
  molecular mechanisms involved in this regulation are unknown. Box F) SorCS1 sorts
  and recycles a number of synaptic receptors including Neurexin, AMPAR or Neuroligin
  at the postsynaptic side, by which it establishes the correct axon-to-dendrite polarization
  of synaptic proteins, processes critical for correct neurotransmission, connectivity,
  and synaptic plasticity
