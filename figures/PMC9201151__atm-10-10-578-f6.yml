caption: Effects of agmatine on the AMPK-NF-κB signaling pathway in the livers of
  septic rats. (A) WB measurement of p-AMPKα1/2, AMPKα1/2, IκBα, NF-κBp65, and GAMT
  protein expression. (B) qPCR measurement of the gene expressions of NF-κBp65, IκBα,
  AMPKα, Stat3, GAMT, and CYP2C24. (C) Immunofluorescence measurement of the protein
  expressions of AMPKα1/2, IκBα, and GAMT (×630). The data were expressed as mean
  ± SEM (n=4–6). ns, no significantly different; *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01. CLP, cecal
  ligation and perforation; WB, Western-blot; qPCR, real-time fluorescence quantitative
  PCR analysis; SEM, standard error of mean.
article_title: Transcriptomics combined with metabolomics analysis of the mechanism
  of agmatine in the treatment of septic liver injury.
