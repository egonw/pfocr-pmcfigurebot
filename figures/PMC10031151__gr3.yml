caption: TBCE regulates chemosensitivity of HCC via affecting the cell cycle and cytoskeleton-related
  FAK phosphorylation pathway. (A, B) KEGG (A) and GSEA (B) analysis of DEGs showed
  that TBCE knockdown affects the cell cycle and G2/M checkpoint. (C) Heat map of
  cell cycle-related genes. (D, E) Representative flow cell cycle test chart (D) and
  statistical analysis (E) showed that TBCE knockdown significantly increased the
  DDP-induced G2/M block. (F) WB analysis of the FAK/AKT/ERK pathway showed that the
  activated FAK pathway in drug-resistant BEL-7402R cells and TBCE knockdown could
  block its phosphorylation activation. (G) TBCE silencing combined with DDP chemotherapy
  could significantly increase the activation of the caspase three apoptotic pathway
  and cause DNA damage (γH2AX). Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3), ∗∗∗P < 0.001
  vs. indicated.
