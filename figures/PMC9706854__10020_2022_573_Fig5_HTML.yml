caption: G15 and U0126 reversed the neuroprotective effects of ICT in tMCAO rats.
  A The experimental timeline. B and C The cerebral infarct volume after tMCAO in
  brain tissue in the different groups were analyzed by TTC staining (n = 4). D Neurological
  function scores. E The rotating speed in rotarod test (n = 4). F The time on rod
  in rotarod test (n = 4). The results are expressed as the mean ± SD, *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, compared with tMCAO + ICT group
article_title: Icaritin inhibits neuroinflammation in a rat cerebral ischemia model
  by regulating microglial polarization through the GPER–ERK–NF-κB signaling pathway.
