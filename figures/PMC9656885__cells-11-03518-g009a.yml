caption: 'Effects of bta-miR-199a-3p on the LPS-induced PI3K/AKT/NF-κB pathway. (A,B)
  Effects of overexpression or inhibition of bta-miR-199a-3p on the mRNA expression
  levels of TLR4, NFKB1, and RELA. (C,D) Effects of overexpression or inhibition of
  bta-miR-199a-3p on the mRNA expression levels of PIK3R1, PIK3CA, AKT1, and AKT3.
  (E–G) Effects of overexpression or inhibition of bta-miR-199a-3p on the protein
  expression levels of PI3K, AKT, p65, and p-p65: (E) is the result of Western blot,
  and (F,G) are the image analysis results of (E) (with β-actin as a standardized
  correction). * refers to p < 0.05, ** refers to p < 0.01, ns refers to p > 0.05.'
