caption: MiRNAs’ involvement in the DNA damage response in ovarian cancer. DNA synthesis
  inhibition or damage induces checkpoint responses. PARP and checkpoint proteins
  controlled by the ATR–CHK1 pathway prevent fork collapse, replication stress, and
  genome instability. DDR-related proteins that are MiRNAs recognizable are shown
  in blue box.
