caption: The regulatory effect of CORM-3 on the Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway
  in the CAL27 and SCC4 cells. (a, b) CAL27 and SCC4 cells were treated with 0, 100,
  200, and 400 μM CORM-3 for 24 h, and western blot was used to detect the protein
  expression of HO-1. (c, d) CORM-3(400 μM) stimulated cells at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3,
  6, and 12 h, respectively. Western blot was used to detect the effect of CORM-3
  on HO-1 protein expression. (e) The efficacy of HO-1specific shRNA was measured
  by RT-qPCR. We finally chose sh-HO-1-3# as the interference sequence. (f) The efficacy
  of shHO-1-3# was measured by western blot. (g, h) The effect of shHO-1 on the inhibitory
  effect of CORM-3 on the proliferation of CAL27 and SCC4 cells. Cell proliferation
  was assessed by a CCK-8 kit. (i, j) The effect of shHO-1 on the inhibitory effect
  of CORM-3 on the migration of CAL27 and SCC4 cells. Quantification of relative migrating
  distances of cells with indicated treatment. (k, l) The effect of shHO-1 on the
  inhibitory effect of CORM-3 on the invasion of CAL27 and SCC4 cells. Quantification
  of the invaded cells with indicated treatment. (m, n) CAL27 and SCC4 cells were
  treated with CORM-3 for 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, and 12 h, and the protein expression
  of Keap1 and Nrf2 was assessed by western blotting. Relative protein level was normalized
  to the corresponding GAPDH protein expression. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P <
  0.001 vs. the control group, respectively. ^P < 0.05 and ^^P < 0.01 vs. comparison
  between two groups.
