figure_title: Changes in the metabolic pathways of young and old leaves in the two
  soybean ecotypes
caption: Suggested changes in the metabolic network in soybean seedlings under LN-stress
  conditions based on a partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). (A) Pathway
  of young leaves; (B) pathway of old leaves. GS1, common soybean; GS2, barren tolerant
  wild soybean; CK, control treatment; LN, low-nitrogen stress.

  of wild soybean under low-nitrogen stress.
