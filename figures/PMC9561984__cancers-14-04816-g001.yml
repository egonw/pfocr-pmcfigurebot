caption: The effects of IL1β overexpression and inhibitors of the IL1β pathway on
  viability of E0771 and breast cancer cells in vitro. (A) Cartoon showing where VX765/VRT043198
  (Caspase-1 inhibitors), MLX01 (IL1β secretion inhibitor), Anakinra (IL1R antagonist)
  and Pacritinib (IRAK1 inhibitor) inhibit the IL1β signalling pathway. (B,C) Effects
  of overexpression of IL1β (IL1B+), overexpression of IL1R1 (IL1R1+), inhibition
  of IL1β (12 ng/mL MLX01), inhibition of Caspase-1 (25 ng/mL VRT043198), inhibition
  of IL1R (0.1mg/kg Anakinra) and inhibition of IRAK1 (250 pg/mL Pacritinib) and recombinant
  IL1β (5 ng/mL) on tumour cell viability, normalised to control. All experiments
  are from three biological experiments and their graphs represent mean + SD, * p
  < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.
