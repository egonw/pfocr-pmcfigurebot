figure_title: Overall mechanisms involved in CNNM4 overexpression caused by APAP overdose
caption: In the liver, APAP overdose leads to increased expression of CNNM4 and an
  enrichment of its localization in the ER. Under these circumstances, reticulum stress
  and mitochondrial dysfunction are induced. The activity of CNNM4 is mainly influenced
  by its role as a magnesium effluxer. Therefore, increased CNNM4 expression reduces
  both mitochondrial and total cellular magnesium levels. When ER stress occurs, UPR
  markers, GRP78, ATF-6, PERK, pEIF2α, XBP1, and CHOP, are activated in order to solve
  the damage. Moreover, IRE1α pathway triggers pJNK activation in order to induce
  apoptosis. pJNK is translocated to mitochondria resulting in mitochondrial ROS,
  mitochondrial dysfunction, and consequently cell death. Another characteristic of
  ER stress is the Ca2+ released into the cytoplasm to induce apoptosis. Finally,
  inflammation markers such as TNF and IL6 are induced as a consequence of APAP overdose.
  Silencing of Cnnm4 in the liver was able to reduce mitochondrial dysfunction, ER
  stress and induce a regenerative response in the hepatocyte to overcome APAP overdose-induced
  necrosis. The image was created with BioRender.com.
