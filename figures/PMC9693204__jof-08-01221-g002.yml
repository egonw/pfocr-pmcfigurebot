caption: Effect of PQ on the activity and amount of U. maydis Aox1. A cellular suspension
  with an initial OD600 nm of 5 was incubated for 4 h in the presence or absence of
  1 mM PQ. At the indicated times, cells were harvested and resuspended in water (1
  mL H2O:1 g wet weight). Oxygen consumption was analyzed with a Clark-type electrode
  in the absence (A) or presence (B) of 1.5 mM cyanide, an inhibitor of the cytochrome
  pathway. (C) Changes in Aox1 expression were determined by measuring the fluorescence
  of the Aox1-Gfp. Samples were withdrawn at the indicated times, and the fluorescence
  was determined by flow cytometry in 20,000 events per condition. (D) The changes
  in fluorescence were corroborated by confocal microscopy. A one-way ANOVA was performed
  to detect significant differences among the means. * Significant difference at p
  < 0.05. The data correspond to an average of four independent experiments (n = 4)
  with bars indicating the standard error.
