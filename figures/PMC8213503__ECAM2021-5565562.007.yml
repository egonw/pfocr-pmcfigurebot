caption: Gene enrichment analyses performed by DAVID and visualized by OmicShare.
  (a) GO biological process. The results showed that vital targets have a very strong
  correlation with physiological mechanisms, such as the serotonin receptor signaling
  pathway, protein autophosphorylation, positive regulation of MAP kinase activity,
  and release of sequestered calcium ion into the cytosol. (b) KEGG enrichment analysis.
  The main pathways were the cancer pathway, calcium signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling
  pathway, and Ras signaling pathway. The vertical axis is the pathname and the horizontal
  axis is the Rich Factor value. The larger the P value, the higher the channel enrichment;
  the size of the point indicates the number of enriched targets; the color of the
  dots is red to green and the value is from small to large.
