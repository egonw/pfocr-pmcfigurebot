caption: 'HNRNPK was identified and validated as a CLCN3 promoter-binding transcription
  factor. (a) To identify putative transcription factors that bind to the CLCN3 promoter,
  nuclear protein extracts were subjected to incubation with a biotin-labeled DNA
  probe that included the promoter region. Following the SDS-PAGE separation and silver
  staining, a protein band with differential expression was identified after which
  it was excised and subjected to mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. (b) By employing
  either a synthesized probe or a nonspecific probe (NSP) in the nuclear protein/DNA
  complex, western blot analysis detected binding between HNRNPK and the CLCN3 promoter.
  (c) ChIP assays were performed and an HNRNPK antibody was used to immunoprecipitate
  the fragmented DNA in H1299 cells. The HNRNPK protein band was substantially enriched
  in the IP group in contrast to the IgG control. (d) The ChIP-seq data showed that
  the recruitment of HNRNPK was mostly enriched in the upstream and downstream TSS
  of the CLCN3 promoter region (NM_001829, chr4: 169620033-169620797, region -538/+226
  bp). (e) The CLCN3 RNA level was inhibited following HNRNPK knockdown (n = 3). (f)
  HNRNPK knockdown disrupted the promoter activities of the pGL4.10-CLCN3-538 reporter
  plasmid (region -538/+226 bp) in H1299 cells, and the binding motifs ''GCGAGG/CTAATG''
  from ChIP-seq data were enriched in this region (n = 3). (g) GO analysis revealed
  that cell proliferation and migration were the biological functions of HNRNPK. (h)
  KEGG pathway analysis illustrated that cell growth and death, cell motility, transcription,
  translation, and other signaling pathways were mainly enriched after HNRNPK knockdown.
  (i) The luciferase activity was considerably reduced in HNRNPK knockdown cells transfected
  with a pGL4.10-CLCN3-538 plasmid (n = 3). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.'
