caption: DEGs identified by RNA-seq were evaluated for functional enrichment using
  multiple gene annotation databases. (A) TopGO was used for GO enrichment analysis.
  GO enrichment analysis results of DEGs were classified according to molecular function
  (MF), biological process (BP) and cell component (CC). The top 10 GO term items
  with minimum p-value and most significant enrichment in each GO category were selected.
  (B) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs. According to KEGG enrichment results,
  the top 20 KEGG pathways with the smallest FDR value, namely the most significant
  enrichment, were selected. (C) For the results of Reactome enrichment analysis of
  DEGs, the top 20 Reactome results with minimum p-value were selected.
