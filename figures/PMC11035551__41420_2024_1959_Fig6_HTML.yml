figure_title: YWHAH overexpression inhibits the activity of neuroblastoma cells by
  regulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway
caption: A The overexpression of YWHAH in NB cells was detected by WB. After YWHAH
  is overexpressed, the cells were harvested for colony formation assay (B), CCK-8
  colorimetric assay (C), EdU staining test (D), migration and invasion (E). F YWHAH
  overexpression or METTL14 knockdown significantly reduced PI3K and AKT phosphorylation
  levels. G Overexpression of METTL14 increased the phosphorylation level of PI3K/AKT,
  while overexpression of YWHAH significantly decreased the phosphorylation level.
  H CCK8 detection showed that METTL14 overexpression could increase the NB cells
  proliferation, while YWHAH overexpression could significantly decrease the increased
  level. ns, not significant; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. The data are based on three separate
  experiments.
