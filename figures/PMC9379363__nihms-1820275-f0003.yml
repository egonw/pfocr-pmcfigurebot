caption: The AR PCa cistrome associates with lipid metabolism, immune response, and
  cytokine signaling. a) Three most significantly enriched nucleotide motifs present
  in AA-ARBS and EA-ARBS by de novo motif analysis. b) Pathway enrichment of the AA-ARBS
  identified using CISTROME-GO.() AR binding intensity in each AA and EA prostate
  tumor for Hallmark lipid metabolism (c) and immune response and cytokine signaling
  (e) gene sets using ssGSEA analysis.() Differential expression analysis in our RNA-seq
  data identifies upregulation of Hallmark lipid metabolism (d) and immune response
  and cytokine signaling (f) gene sets in AA (n=30) versus EA (n=19) prostate tumors.
  g) Estimation of tumor infiltrate immune populations demonstrates greater signal
  for B-cells (P = 0.01) and macrophages (P = 0.003), and a trend towards CD8+ T-cells
  (P = 0.051) in AA versus EA PCa.()
