figure_title: LMP1-expressing tumors are sensitive to inhibition of noncanonical NF-κB
  signaling
caption: (A) Distribution of LMP1 gene expression in NPC tumors (n = 99 libraries,
  median log2tpm = 2.51, represented by red bar). (B) LMP1 gene expression in EBV-positive
  NPC cell lines (n = 1 per cell line). (C) In vitro proliferation of EBV-positive
  NPC cell lines when treated with B022, an NIK inhibitor targeting the noncanonical
  NF-κB pathway. Error bars represent SD. (D) Western blot of the noncanonical p100/p52
  subunits in the C666-1 and NPC43 cell lines when treated with increasing concentrations
  of B022.
