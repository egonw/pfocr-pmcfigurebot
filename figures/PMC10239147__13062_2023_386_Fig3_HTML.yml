caption: Effects of LINC01003 on the cell migration of glioma cells. A A transwell
  assay was employed to determine the migration of U87MG and U251 cells with LINC01003
  knockdown. The glioma cells that migrated were counted; scale bars, 200 μm. B Wound
  healing assays was also employed to determine the migration of U87MG and U251 cells
  with LINC01003 knockdown. The scratch was measured 0 and 48 h after the scratch
  was performed; scale bars, 200 μm. C Western blot was used to determine the expression
  of matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2), MMP9, E-Cadherin (E-cad) and N-Cadherin (N-cad)
  in U87MG and U251 cells with LINC01003 knockdown. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001
article_title: m6A-mediated upregulation of LINC01003 regulates cell migration by
  targeting the CAV1/FAK signaling pathway in glioma.
