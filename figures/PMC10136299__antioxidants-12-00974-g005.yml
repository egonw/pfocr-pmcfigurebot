caption: Large HDV antigen induced unfolded protein response. (a,b) Huh7 cells were
  co-transfected with plasmids encoding S-HDAg (pDL444), L-HDAg (pDL445), the full
  HDV genome (pSVLD3), or empty pVax1 vector as a negative control with the reporter
  plasmids encoding a luciferase gene under the control of the SV40 promoter with
  minimum UPRE (pUPRE), ERSE (pERSE), or AARE (pAARE), or promoters of Xbp1 (pXbp1),
  CHOP (pCHOP), or Grp78 (pGRP78). Two (a) or four (b) days post-transfection, luciferase
  expression was quantified by assaying its enzymatic activity in cell lysates. (c–e)
  Huh7 cells were transfected with the above-mentioned plasmids, and the mRNA (c)
  or protein (d,e) levels were analyzed by RT-qPCR and Western blotting, respectively.
  The β-actin blot in panel (e) was also used in panel 4f, as they came from the same
  experiment. Bars represent the means ± S.D. Statistical significance was analyzed
  by ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc test (a) or unpaired Student’s test with Welch
  correction (b). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 vs. pVax1-transfected cells.
