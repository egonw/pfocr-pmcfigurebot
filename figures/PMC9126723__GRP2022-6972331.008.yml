caption: BHLHE41 overexpression weakened the HIF-1α and EMT-related factor levels
  in hypoxia-induced CC cells. (a) and (b). The BHLHE41, hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha
  (HIF-1α), and epithelial-mesenchymal transition- (EMT-) related factor levels in
  hypoxia-induced CC cells were tested by Western blot. All experiments have been
  performed in triplicate, and data were expressed as mean ± SD. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. hypoxia;
  ▲P < 0.5, ▲▲P < 0.01 vs. control.
