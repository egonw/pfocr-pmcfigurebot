figure_title: Impaired IPC differentiation in response to the T6SS
caption: (A) Differentially regulated genes in the Notch signaling pathway, from RNA-sequencing
  of IPCs from flies mock infected or infected with C6706ΔvasK or C6706 (B) Immunofluorescence
  of the posterior midguts of esgts>CFP, Su(H)-GFP flies mock infected or infected
  with C6706ΔvasK, or C6706. DRAQ5 marks DNA (red), CFP marks esg positive IPCs (blue),
  and GFP marks Su(H) positive enteroblasts. Scale bars are 10μm. (C) Quantification
  of the number of IPCs (CFP-positive), per unit surface area from (B). Each dot represents
  a measurement from a single fly gut. (D) Quantification of the number of intestinal
  stem cells (CFP-positive, GFP-negative) per unit surface area from (B). (E) Quantification
  of the number of enteroblasts (CFP-positive, GFP-positive) per unit surface area
  from (B).
