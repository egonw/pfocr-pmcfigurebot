caption: 'Effect of SANG on the angiogenic cytokine-related gene in TNF-α-stimulated
  MDA-MB-231 (A) and MDA-MB-468 (B) cells. GAPDH normalized PCR data revealed a significant
  upregulation in CCL2 and its regulator gene IKBKE mRNA. These genes were significantly
  repressed in the presence of 2 µM or 1.5 µM SANG in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells,
  respectively. The data are presented as the mean ± SEM of three independent studies.
  An unpaired t-test was used to analyze the significance of the difference between
  TNF α-stimulated vs. < 0.1 DMSO-treated resting cells (*) and TNF-α-activated vs.
  co-treated cells (#). ****/#### p < 0.0001, ### p < 0.001, and ## p < 0.01, * p
  < 0.05 are considered significant references; NS, not significant.'
