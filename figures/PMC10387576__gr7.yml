caption: Identification of Rab5 and/or PGRP-LE dependent genes in E.cc-infected gut(A)
  Clustering analysis of the expression of genes from control, PGRP-LERNAi and Rab5RNAi
  of uninfected and infected flies.(B) Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of different
  clusters from (A)S (padj < 0.05). KEGG pathways are shown from GO term.(C and D)
  Selected differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of interest from Imd/NF-kB pathway
  is shown as fold change (padj < 0.05). For fold change, levels of uninfected control
  flies were set to 1, values obtained with other genotypes were expressed as a fold
  of this value. Log2 values are plotted on bar graph.
