caption: Hindgut microbiota and metabolites media colon inflammatory process. Gut
  microbes, especially Bacteroides sp. and bacteria-derived metabolites were identified
  using short-chain fatty acids (propionate, butyrate, and valerate) and p-cresol,
  carnitine. Altered colon metabolic dysfunction was involved in the renin-angiotensin
  system pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, and peroxisome proliferators-activated
  receptor signaling pathway. GPR43 = G protein–coupled receptor 43; GPR109A = G protein–coupled
  receptor 109A; CCR9 = C-C motif chemokine receptor 9; CCL25 = C-C motif chemokine
  ligand 25; CCL11 = C-C motif chemokine ligand 11; SLC27A2 = solute carrier family
  27 member 2; NR1H3 = nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group H member 3; FABP6 = fatty
  acid binding protein 6; gp130 = interleukin-6 receptor subunit beta; STAT3 = signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 3; Bax = B-cell lymphoma associated X;
  Bcl-2 = B-cell lymphoma-2.

  barrier function development at the early weaning goat model.
