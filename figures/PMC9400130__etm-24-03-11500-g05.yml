caption: mRNA expression of LTBP2 is correlated with the TME infiltration cell characteristics
  and immune checkpoint genes. (A and B) The correlation scatter plot revealed that
  LTBP2 expression was positively correlated with (A) immune score and (B) stromal
  score in TCGA-PRAD dataset. (C and D) The correlation scatter plot confirmed that
  LTBP2 expression was significantly positively correlated with T-cell CD4 memory
  resting, while it was significantly negatively correlated with T-cell follicular
  helper in TCGA-PRAD dataset. (E) The scatter plot showed that the mRNA expression
  of LTBP2 was significantly positively correlated with the relative expression of
  immune checkpoint genes, including PD-L1, CTLA4, PD-1, but negatively correlated
  with tumor purity in the TIMER database and GEPIA database (cor >0; P-value <0.001).
