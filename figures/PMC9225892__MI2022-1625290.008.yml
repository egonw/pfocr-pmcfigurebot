caption: Dual effect of Vericiguat on RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and molecular
  mechanism. There may be a potential balance between the IκB-α/NF-κB signaling pathway
  and sGC/cGMP/VASP in BMMs. Vericiguat at low doses (0-2 μmol/l) enhanced RANKL-induced
  osteoclastogenesis dominantly through upregulation of the VASP/IκB-α/NF-κB signaling
  pathway, whereas Vericiguat at high doses (4 or 8 μmol/L) suppressed RANKL-induced
  osteoclastogenesis through directly inhibiting the IκB-α/NF-κB signaling pathway
  signaling cascade, which could disturb VASP-mediated activation of the IκB-α/NF-κB
  signaling pathway.
