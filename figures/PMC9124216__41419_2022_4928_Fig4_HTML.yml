figure_title: Effects of ADAM15 and FAK inhibitor defactinib (VS-6063) on NSCLC cell
  growth in vivo
caption: A Representative images of tumours in these four groups. See the Methods
  section for details. B Tumour growth curves in mice on the indicated days. C Each
  tumour from indicated mice was weighed. D, E ADAM15 mRNA and protein expression
  in tumours was measured by qRT-PCR and western blot analyses. F Inhibition of FAK
  was carried out by using 2 μM defactinib (VS-6063) in A549 cell lines. G Representative
  images of tumours in these four groups. See the Methods section for details. H Tumour
  growth curves in mice on the indicated days. I Each tumour from the indicated mice
  was weighed. J Protein expression in tumours was measured by western blot analysis.

  signalling pathway individually and promote non-small-cell lung cancer progression.
