caption: 'Difference in gene expression between MLB46-05 and MLB. (A): total amount
  of up- and down-regulated gene expression; (B): Biological Process gene expression
  difference; (C): Molecular Function gene expression difference. Up (red) indicates
  genes with up-regulated expression, down (blue) indicates genes with down-regulated
  expression, and the numbers x/y indicate down/up; (D): Effects of ALE on metabolic
  pathways and genes in E. coli. Abbreviations in the figure as well as gene annotations
  are available in the Table . Red arrows indicate that the expression of related
  genes in this pathway is significantly up-regulated (At least 1.2 times) and green
  arrows indicate that the expression of related genes in this pathway is down-regulated
  (At least 1.2 times)'
article_title: Effect of adaptive laboratory evolution of engineered Escherichia coli
