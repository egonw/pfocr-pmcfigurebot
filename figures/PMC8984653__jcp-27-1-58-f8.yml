figure_title: The effect of 6-(methylsulfinyl) hexyl isothiocyanate (6-MSITC) on phosphorylation
  of AMPK1 and FOXO1 and expression of HO-1, PPARα, and Sirtuin1 in combined fatty
  acids (CFA) medium
caption: HepG2 cells were treated with 5, 10, or 20 μM of 6-MSITC in CFA medium. Six
  hours culture was used to detect the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase
  α (p-AMPKα) and expression of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) (A), and 24 hours culture
  was used to detect the expressions of PPARα, p-Forkhead box protein O1 (p-FOXO1)
  and Sirtuin1 (B). The whole-cell lysates were used to detect the mentioned proteins
  by Western blot analysis with their respective antibodies. Densitometry of the blots
  was performed using the LumiVision Imager software. Histograms show the densitometric
  analysis of the mentioned proteins normalized to β-actin. The data were from triplicate
  analysis. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.05.
