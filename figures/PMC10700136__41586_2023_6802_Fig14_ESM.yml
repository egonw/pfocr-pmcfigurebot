figure_title: Mapping CognitionOrganismal and CognitionArtery proteins to human organs
  and cell types
caption: a, The organ sources of highly weighted CognitionOrganismal proteins were
  investigated by analyzing their expression levels in the Gene Tissue Expression
  Atlas (GTEx) bulk RNA-seq database. Organ-level expression of pleiotrophin (PTN),
  transgelin (TAGLN), WNT1 inducible signalling pathway protein 2 (WISP2), and chordin
  like 1 (CHRDL1) are shown. Though not organ-specific, these genes were highly expressed
  in the arteries and brain. b, Single-cell RNA expression (Tabula Sapiens) of highly
  weighted CognitionOrganismal proteins in human vasculature. Mean normalized expression
  values and fraction of cells expressing the genes are shown. c, Single-cell RNA
  expression (Tabula Sapiens) of highly weighted CognitionArtery and StringDB-based
  “interacting” proteins in human vasculature. Mean normalized expression values and
  fraction of cells expressing the genes are shown.
