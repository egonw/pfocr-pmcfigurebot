caption: Signaling pathways involved in radiation-induced autophagy-dependent cell
  death. The initiation of classical autophagy pathway is mainly accomplished by the
  interaction of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1(mTORC1) and ULK 1 (Atg 1)
  complex. Moreover, there is an atypical cell autophagy called Mitochondrial autophagy
  (Mitophagy), whose pathway is mainly dependent or independent of the interaction
  of PINK1 (a mitochondrial-specific kinase), PARKIN and E3 ubiquitin ligase.
