caption: 'Biosynthetic pathway for UDP-β-l-Rha and UDP-α-d-Vio4NAc. (a) Comparison
  of NDP-β-l-Rha biosynthesis in bacteria and plants/viruses. The two pathways differ
  by the nucleotide used and the number of enzymes involved: three for bacteria and
  two in APMV. Plants have only one enzyme because UGD and UGER are part of the same
  protein. (b) Reaction of APMV R141 (or ATCV-1 Z544R) with UDP-α-d-Glc to give UDP-4-keto-α-d-Glc;
  this substrate is used by two APMV proteins L780 and L136 to synthesize UDP-β-l-Rha
  and UDP-α-d-Vio4N, respectively. This last product is N-acetylated by N-L142, leading
  to the formation of UDP-α-dVio4NAc. (c) Crystallographic structures of: L136 (PDB
  7MFO) in complex with TDP-Vio4N linked as an external aldimine, R141 (PDB 6VL0)
  in complex with TDP and NAD, and L780 (PDB 7JID) with UDP-β-l-Rha bound; α-helices
  are colored in red, β-strands in cyan, and loops in gray. The N-L142 model was obtained
  by homology modeling using Neisseria gonorrheae PglB enzyme as a reference. The
  activities of the enzymes are indicated as acronyms in brackets.'
