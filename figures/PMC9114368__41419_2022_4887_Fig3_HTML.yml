figure_title: CircLIFR suppresses HCC progression in vivo
caption: 'A, B Image of subcutaneous tumors in nude mice after injection of Huh7 cells
  (n = 6 for each group). C The tumor volume is shown to be significantly decreased
  in Huh7 circLIFR-overexpressing group compared with that in control group. D The
  tumor weight is significantly lower in circLIFR-overexpressing group than that in
  control group. E Representative images of xenografts stained with Ki-67 by immunohistochemistry
  (IHC). Images at ×200 (left panel) and ×400 (right panel) magnification. Scale bar:
  left = 100 μm; right = 50 μm. F Representative images of orthotopic xenograft tumor
  growth over time and quantitative analysis of the relative fluorescence intensity
  over time in Huh7 vector and circLIFR overexpression (OE-circLIFR) groups (n = 3
  for each group). G Photographs of orthotopic xenograft tumor from Huh7 vector and
  OE-circLIFR groups and matched xenograft tumor hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining
  are shown. Images were photographed at ×100 (left panel) and ×400 (right panel)
  magnification. Scale bar: left = 200 μm; right = 50 μm. Data represent means ± SD
  of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05.'
