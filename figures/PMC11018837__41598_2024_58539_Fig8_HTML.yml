caption: RACGAP1 knockdown induced cell apoptosis in A549 cells. A549 cells were transfected
  with si-Ctrl or three independent siRNAs for si-RACGAP1. (a) Cell apoptosis was
  determined using Annexin V/PI staining and FACS analysis. Representative plots and
  percentage of apoptotic cells are presented. *P < 0.05 vs. si-Ctrl. (b) Protein
  levels of Bax and Bcl-2 after RACGAP1 knockdown were determined using Western blot
  analysis. Representative images are shown and quantitated using ImageLab software.
  β-actin was used as an internal control. *P < 0.05 vs. si-Ctrl.
