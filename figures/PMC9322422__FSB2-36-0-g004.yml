caption: Pathway analysis of the altered protein profile of rab28 KO shows reduced
  levels of core ciliary trafficking and phototransduction components (A–C) KEGG pathway
  analysis of significantly downregulated (blue) and upregulated (red) proteins in
  rab28 −/− compared with wild‐type siblings at outer segment phagocytosis peaks and
  trough (D–F) Tables describing significantly downregulated and upregulated proteins
  associated with core ciliary trafficking components (D), phototransduction (E) and
  the visual cycle (F), respectively. Statistical analysis was carried out using a
  student's t test. (G) Scatter plot of visual behavior‐based contrast sensitivity
  of rab28 −/− larvae at 5 days post fertilization (dpf). Data are from three independent
  replicates. At least 16 larvae were tested per genotype for each assay. (H) Scatter
  plot of visual behavior‐based visual acuity of rab28 −/− larvae at 5 dpf. rab28 KO
  larvae do not show any reduction in visual acuity compared with sibling control
  when tested at 0.02, 0.06 or 0.2 cpd, analyzed using a student's t test. Data are
  from three independent replicates, analyzed using a student's t test. (I) Normalized
  ERG b‐wave amplitudes recorded in rab28 KO at 2 months post fertilization show no
  significant difference compared with ERG‐traces from wild‐type controls (n = 12,
  n = 13), statistical analysis was carried out using a student's t test
