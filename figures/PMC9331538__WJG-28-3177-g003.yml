caption: 'Parathyroid hormone-related peptide modulates Met activation through the
  mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway in HCT116 cells. Cells were treated
  with PD-98059 or SB-203580, a selective mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  kinase (MEK) or P38 MAPK inhibitor, respectively, for 30 min and then exposed to
  10-8 mol/L PTHrP for 1 h to evaluate whether ERK1/2 MAPK and/or p38 MAPK mediate
  the effect of PTHrP on Met activation in HCT116 cells. Controls were run by adding
  an equivalent volume of dimethylsulfoxide, the vehicle of the inhibitors. The protein
  levels of Met phosphorylated in the residues Tyr1234 and Tyr1235 were assessed by
  Western blot. These phosphorylation sites constitute activating domains of the receptor.
  GAPDH protein levels were determined as a control of the amount of proteins present
  in the membrane, since this protein is not substantially modified with the treatment
  by the cytokine. Graph bars represent the average of the results obtained from three
  independent experiments. DMSO: Dimethylsulfoxide; GAPDH: Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; Met: Receptor tyrosine kinase Met; p-Met: Phospho-Met (Tyr1234/1235);
  PTHrP: Parathyroid hormone-related peptide. aP < 0.05.'
