caption: PRDX1 knock-down reduced mitochondrial transmembrane potential in HCC cells.
  A. Western blot results depicted that PRDX1 knock-down substantially reduced expression
  of Bcl-2 and increased Bax expression. The lower bottom showed quantifications of
  protein levels. B. Mitotracker red assay was used to see the effect of si-PRDX1
  expression on mitochondrial morphology of hepatoma cells. PRDX1 knock-down induced
  significantly increased filamentous mitochondrial morphology, assessed by fluorescent
  intensity. Representative graphs show quantifications. The experiment was repeated
  three times. Data represent mean Â± SEM. **; P<0.01, and ***; P<0.001.
