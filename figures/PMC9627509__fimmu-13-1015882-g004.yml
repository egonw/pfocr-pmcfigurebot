caption: (A) the top 20 enriched clusters across feature genes, colored by p-values.
  (B) The top-level Gene Ontology biological processes colored by p-values. The darker
  the color, the stronger the enrichment of the gene in that pathway. (C) The PPI
  network of feature genes. Each blue node represents a gene, and each other node
  represents a protein. Different sizes indicate the core degree of genes in the PPI
  network, whereas a bigger size indicates more importance in the network.
