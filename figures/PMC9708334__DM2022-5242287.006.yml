caption: 'Gene ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of significant genes
  associated with m6A modification patterns in the parotid of Sjögren''s syndrome
  (a) The annular chart shows the total number (outer second loop) and the number
  of significant differences (outer third loop) of genes enriched in biological processes,
  molecular functions, and cellular components (outer first loop). (b) The barplot
  of gene ontology enrichment analysis (BP: biological process; CC: cellular component;
  MF: molecular function). (c) The bubble diagram of gene ontology enrichment. (d)
  The barplot of KEGG signalling pathway enrichment.'
