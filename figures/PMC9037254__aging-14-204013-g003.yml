caption: Relative expression of mRNA. (A) Expression of Nrf2, HO-1 and HIF-1α in GC
  cells cultured under a hypoxic condition. (B) Expression of Nrf2 in GC cells after
  they were transfected with negative control siRNA or Nrf2 siRNAs (siNrf2-1498, siNrf2-2081
  and siNrf2-2226). (C) Expression of Nrf2, HO-1 and HIF-1α in GC cells after they
  were transfected with siNrf2-1498 and cultured under a hypoxic condition. (*P<0.05,
  **P<0.001).
article_title: Abnormal phenotype of Nrf2 is associated with poor prognosis through
  hypoxic/VEGF-A-Rap1b/VEGFR2 pathway in gastric cancer.
