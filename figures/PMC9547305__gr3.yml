caption: The IGF2BP1-IQGAP3-SRF-FOXM1 network regulates the pluripotent transcriptome(A)
  NTERA-2 cells were treated with retinoic acid (RA). qPCR and immunoblots show the
  mRNA and protein expression of IQGAP3, IGF2BP1, SRF, FOXM1, and other stem cell
  factors, respectively. C and D represent control and differentiated cells, respectively.
  Data bars represent mean values with SD(n = 3).(B–D) mRNA and protein expression
  levels of IQGAP3 and stem cell markers after IGF2BP1, (C) SRF or (D) FOXM1 KD in
  NTERA-2 cells. Differentiation status was assessed by GFAP expression. Data bars
  represent mean values with SD(n = 3).(E) Morphological changes in NTERA-2 cells
  after KD of IQGAP3, IGF2BP1, SRF, or FOXM1 compared to RA-induced differentiated
  cells. Scale bars represent 100 μm.(F) GSEA of differentially expressed genes in
  NTERA-2 cells after KD of IGF2BP1, IQGAP3, SRF, or FOXM1.(G) Venn’s diagram and
  H) GO pathway enrichment analysis of commonly downregulated genes after KD of IGF2BP1,
  IQGAP3, SRF, or FOXM1. Pathway enrichment was conducted using MetaScape software.See
