caption: Inflamed joint tissue shows extensive changes in circadian transcriptional
  regulation. (A and B) Joint samples from naïve and CIA mice were collected on symptomatic
  day 7 at six time points and analyzed by RNA sequencing (n = 5/time point per condition).
  Heat maps (A) represent the normalized (z-scored) transcript expression levels in
  naïve (Left) and CIA (Right) mice over time (columns, from ZT0 at 4-h intervals).
  Differential rhythmicity analysis categorized transcript expression profiles according
  to change or maintenance of rhythmicity with disease (B). (C) CIA significantly
  altered the transcript expression of a number of core clock genes (CIA vs. naïve
  comparison by two-way ANOVA indicated in black; adjusted P [adjP] value of JTK analysis
  indicated in blue and red; n = 5/point. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P
  < 0.0001. Data are presented as mean ± SEM). (D) Groups of genes showing significant
  differential expression (DE) or rhythmic change with disease were analyzed for functional
  enrichment using the Enrichr tool (Materials and Methods) to identify altered gene
  expression across metabolic and signaling pathways (spot size represents fold enrichment
  of genes in group vs. the genome; color represents significance of enrichment; spot
  absence means no genes from the pathway were allocated to the group on statistical
  categorization). (E) Spline graphs show the mean normalized expression of all genes
  in selected WikiPathways gene sets (WP295, WP1269, and WP2292; error bars represent
  95% CIs around the mean), demonstrating altered pathway expression in CIA mice.
  GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; ns, not significant.
