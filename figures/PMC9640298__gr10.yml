caption: 'The angiogenesis and muscle reinnervation performance of different groups
  and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway investigation of rGO/PCL and PCL conduits in
  vivo. (A) CD31 immunochemistry staining revealed the neo-vessels in the regenerated
  nerves. Scale bar: 100 μm. (B) Quantitative analysis of CD31 expression area. (C)
  Masson trichrome staining of regenerated gastrocnemius muscle of rats. Scale bar:
  200 μm. (D) Quantitative analysis of average Pm in each group. (E) Akt and p-Akt
  staining of regenerated nerves from rGO/PCL and PCL conduits. Scale bar: 200 μm
  (left) and 50 μm (right). (F–G) Quantitative analysis of p-Akt and Akt expression
  levels in rGO/PCL and PCL groups. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.'
