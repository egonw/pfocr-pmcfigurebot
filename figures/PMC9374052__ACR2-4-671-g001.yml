caption: GSEA of the MSigDB (A and C) hallmark and (B and D) canonical gene sets comparing
  responders (NES > 0) to non‐responders (NES < 0) at (A and B) baseline and at (C
  and D) outcome. All significant hallmark pathways are shown. The 50 most significant
  canonical pathways are shown. Dot size corresponds to the number of genes in the
  pathway. Dot color corresponds to the significance of the pathway. †Indicates that
  the pathway was enriched in subjects with JDM at diagnosis compared with healthy
  controls (A1). *Indicates that the remainder of the pathway name is not shown. GSEA,
  gene set enrichment analysis; JDM, juvenile dermatomyositis; NES, normalized enrichment
  score.
