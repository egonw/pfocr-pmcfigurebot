figure_title: Reprogramming of arginine Metabolism in renal cancer
caption: 'Arginine metabolism in cancer cells involves both urea cycle and TCA cycle.
  Normal cells synthesize arginine from citrulline through the urea cycle. Argininosuccinate
  synthase-1 (ASS1), the enzyme responsible for arginine synthesis in the urea cycle,
  is often downregulated in RCC. Thus, renal cancer cells are heavily dependent on
  external arginine supply for growth and survival. Through the synthesis of Fumarate
  from Arginosuccinate, an intermediate in the urea cycle, Arginine can enter through
  TCA cycle; however, this pathway is often downregulated in RCC cells due to lack
  of arginine synthesis and decreased ASS1 expression. The metabolites are depicted
  by squares and enzymes or transporters are denoted by ovals in the figures. Red
  arrows: Decrease in activity. Abbreviations: OCT, ornithine carbamoyl transferase.'
