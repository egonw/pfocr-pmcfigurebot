caption: 'MAP kinases as alternative mechanisms of STAT3/SOCS3 activation in prefrontal
  cortex of rats exposed to CMS and treated with agomelatine. Activation ratio of
  nuclear p38 at Threonine180/Tyrosine182 (A) and ERK1/2 at Threonine202/Tyrosine204
  (B,C), as well as mRNA levels of the BCL-xl gene (D) were assessed in prefrontal
  cortex of rats exposed to CMS and treated with agomelatine. Data, expressed as percentage
  vs. unstressed rats treated with vehicle (No Stress/Vehicle, set at 100%), are mean
  Â± SEM of at least 6 independent determinations and are presented as a ratio between
  phosphorylated and total forms of proteins examined. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; ***
  p < 0.001 vs. No Stress/Vehicle; ## p < 0.01 vs. Stress/Vehicle (two-way ANOVA with
  PLSD).'
