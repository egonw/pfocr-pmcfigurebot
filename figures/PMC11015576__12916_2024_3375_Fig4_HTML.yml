caption: 'PREX2 modulated radiation-induced DNA damage response by regulating NHEJ
  repair. A Representative fluorescence images of γH2AX staining. Scale bar: 10 μm.
  B Quantification of γ-H2AX immunostaining in PREX2 overexpressed RKO cells and PREX2
  knocked down SW480 cells with or without 4 Gy radiation. C, D The comet assay of
  stable overexpression and interference cell lines after IR treatment (scale bar:
  50 μm, C) and the statistics result of quantification of tail moment (D). E Western
  blot detection of the expression levels of DNA-PKc, p-DNA-PKc, p-ATM, ATM, p-ATR,
  ATR, p-CHK1, and CHK1 in stable overexpression and interference cell lines with
  or without 4 Gy radiation. F Bioinformatics analysis of the correlation between
  PREX2 and genes related to NHEJ pathway (XRCC6, XRCC5, LIG4, PARP1, TOPBP1 and PRKDC)
  in TCGA-CRC. ns, not significant, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001'
