caption: 'Mupirocin inhibited the expression of IARS in the epidermis of IMQ-induced
  mice associated with IL-17 signaling pathway. A Representative immunofluorescence
  images (left) and quantification analysis (right) of IARS on the skin of the vehicle-treated,
  MUP + IMQ-treated and IMQ-treated mice. Scale Bar = 100 μm. (n = 5 ± SEM). * P < 0.05,
  ** P < 0.01 versus vehicle. B A western blot analysis was performed to measure the
  expression of IARS of epidermis from the three treated mice. β-actin was used as
  loading control. C Based on the RNA-seq analysis of mouse epidermis, KEGG was used
  to analyze the signal pathways of different genes in the epidermis of the MUP + IMQ-treated
  and IMQ-treated mice. D Based on the results of RNA-seq, analyze the differential
  gene expression in the epidermis of the three treated mice (n = 4) including: Mmp1b,
  Mmp13, S100a9, S100a8, Cxcl2, Il17f, Defb4, Lcn2,Il17b,Cxcl5,Il17a,Il1b,Cxcl1,Cxcl3
  and Csf3. E Biolegend Elisa detection kit detects the expression of IL-17A in the
  epidermis of three treated mice; R&D Luminex Multi-Analyte Assay detects the expression
  of IL-17E, CCL3, CCL19, CXCL2, Serpin E1, and S100A9 protein in the epidermis of
  three treated mice. (n = 3 ± SEM), *P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01'
