caption: (A) The generation of intracellular ROS in MG-63 detected by DCFH-DA staining
  (M1 represents an intact cell population, and M2 represents cells with the accumulation
  of intracellular ROS). (B) Histogram showing the generation of intracellular ROS
  in MG-63 cells (24 h) exposed to BDCe fraction from O. bracteata. (C) The disruption
  of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) in Mg-63 cells detected by staining with
  Rhodamine 123 (M1 represents cells with the disruption of ΔΨm and M2 represents
  the intact cells.). (D) Histogram showing disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential
  (ΔΨm) in MG-63 cells (24 h) exposed to BDCe fraction from O. bracteata. (E) The
  treatment of the BDCe fraction from O. bracteata (24 h) induced cell cycle arrest
  at the G0/G1 phase in MG-63 cells detected by a cell-cycle-analysis kit. (F) Histogram
  showing different phases of G0/G1, S, G2/M in MG-63 cells using a flow cytometer.
  (a) Untreated MG-63 cells, (b) MG-63 cells treated with BDCe fraction (37.53 µM)
  for 24 h. Data labels with different letters represent significant difference among
  them at (p ≤ 0.05).
