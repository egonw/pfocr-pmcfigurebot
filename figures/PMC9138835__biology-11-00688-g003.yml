caption: Enriched gene pathways associated with predicted target genes. The specific
  and representative subclasses of pathways are shown on the y-axis while the complete
  results from the analysis of enriched Reactome pathways are given in . The enriched
  pathways were grouped into categories and each category were assigned a number where
  each number represents the following categories, 1. Cell cycle, 2. Cellular responses
  to stress, 3. Gene expression (Transcription), 4. Immune system, 5. Metabolism of
  lipids, 6. Metabolism of proteins, 7. Metabolism of RNA, 8. Signal Transduction,
  9. Transport of small molecules, 10. Vesicle-mediated transport, 11. Biological
  oxidations, 12. Programmed cell death, 13. Metabolism of vitamins and cofactors,
  14. Metabolism of nucleotides, 15. Metabolism of amino acids and derivatives, 16.
  Metabolism of carbohydrates, 17. Hemostasis, 18. Chromatin organization). The dot
  size indicates the number of DE-miRNA target genes associated with the pathway and
  the dot color indicates the significance of the enrichment (âˆ’log10 (FDR-corrected
  p-values). The vertical grey dashed line represents a fold enrichment of 1.
