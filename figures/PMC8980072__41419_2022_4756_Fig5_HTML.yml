figure_title: Protein levels of EMT-associated genes potentially affected by PARD6A
  expression
caption: Representative western blot of EMT-associated genes in SKOV3 (A) and A2780
  cells (B) with PARD6A silenced. Total protein lysates were subjected to immunoblot
  analysis with the indicated antibodies, except that nuclear lysates were subjected
  to immunoblot analysis with SNAIL1 or Histone H3 antibodies. Representative western
  blot of EMT-associated genes in HO8910 (C) and OVCAR8 cells (D) with PARD6A overexpressed.
  Total protein lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies,
  except that nuclear lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with SNAIL1 or
  Histone H3 antibodies.
