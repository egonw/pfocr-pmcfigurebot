caption: ALYREF regulates EGFR expression and activates the STAT3 pathway. (A) Correlation
  analysis between EGFR and ALYREF mRNA expression in the LIHC verification cohort
  1. (B, C) IHC staining of EGFR, snail, slug, E-cadherin, N-cadherin in tissues with
  high ALYREF+ cell signals and tissues with low ALYREF+ cell signals in LIHC cohorts
  2 and 3. (D) EGFR mRNA levels were determined by qRT-PCR assays in LIHC cells with
  ALYREF knockdown. (E) EGFR proteins were measured by western blotting assays in
  LIHC cells with ALYREF knockdown. (F) EGFR mRNA were determined by qRT-PCR assays
  in LIHC cells overexpressing ALYREF. (G) Expression of antibodies targeting components
  of three main downstream signaling pathways of EGFR as examined by western blotting
  in LIHC cells with ALYREF knockdown. (H) The expression of EGFR, STAT3, and P-STAT3
  was examined by western blotting in LIHC cells overexpressing ALYREF. (I) The expression
  of EMT-related proteins after ALYREF knockdown was detected by western blotting
  assays in LIHC cells. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01; n.s, not significant; Student's t test.
