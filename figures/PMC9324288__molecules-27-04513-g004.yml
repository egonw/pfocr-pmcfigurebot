caption: 'Friedelin improved pre and post synapse and memory dysfunction against scopolamine
  in mice. The up-regulation of SYP and PSD95 in response to administration of friedelin
  along with scopolamine in contrast to the control and scopolamine group is shown
  at (a), along with the histogram plot of respective relative densities (b,c). The
  results were expressed in arbitrary unit (A.U) and were determined using Image J
  software and histogram indicates mean in A.U ± SEM. While results of behavioral
  tests are given as (d) mean escape latency in MWM (e) probe test, (f) %age spontaneous
  alteration in Y-Maze test and (g) Y-Maze number of arm entries. Significance of
  control vs. scopolamine is expressed as #, while * denotes scopolamine vs. scopolamine
  + friedelin. Significance: # p < 0.05, **, ## p < 0.01 and ***, ### p < 0.001.'
