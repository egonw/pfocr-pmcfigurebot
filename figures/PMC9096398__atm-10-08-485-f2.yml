caption: BBR activated the ASK1/JNK and mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in NSCLC cells.
  (A) The A549 and PC9 cells were treated with BBR (0, 40, and 80 μM) for 48 h, after
  which the ASK1, p-ASK1, JNK, and p-JNK levels were assessed by western blotting,
  (B) The protein levels from (A) were quantified. (C) After the same treatment described
  in (A), changes in MMP were measured in the NSCLC cells. (D) Cells with low MMP
  are shown in Q2, and were quantified. (E) After the same treatment described in
  (A), the A549 and PC9 cells were separated into mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions,
  and the cytochrome c levels in these fractions were measured by Western blotting.
  (F) The protein levels from (E) were quantified. The data are presented as the mean
  ± standard deviation for the three different experiments with triplicate sets in
  each assay. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, and ***P<0.001. BBR, berberine; ASK1, apoptosis signal-regulating
  kinase 1; JNK, c-jun-NH2-kinase; NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer; MMP, mitochondrial
  membrane potential.
