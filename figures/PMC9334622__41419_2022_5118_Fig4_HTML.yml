figure_title: PAK6 regulates the efficiency of HR
caption: 'a Schematic illustration of HR in HEK 293T-HR-EGFP reporter cells. b PAK6
  overexpression leads to increase HR efficiency. HEK 293T-HR-EGFP cells were cotransfected
  with either empty controls or PAK6 and Myc-I-SceI plasmids. The expression of EGFP,
  PAK6, and Myc-I-SceI was detected by WB analysis. The percentage of EGFP positive
  cells were examined by flow cytometry. c–f Real-time PCR analysis of the mRNA level
  of the key molecules involved in HR pathway in PAK6 knocked down and overexpression
  cells in the absence (c, e) and presence (d, f) of oxaliplatin. Data presented as
  mean ± SD of three independent replicates. g, h WB analysis of HR related key genes,
  PAK6, γH2A.X, cleaved caspase 3, and GAPDH in PAK6 knocked down cells of 823 and
  AGS GC cell lines (g) and PAK6 overexpression cells of 7901 and 803 GC cell lines
  (h) in the absence and presence of oxaliplatin. i, j Left: Representative images
  of PAK6 staining (red), RAD51 staining (green), and DAPI staining (blue) of control
  cells and PAK6 overexpression cells in 7901 (i) and 803 (j) GC cell lines in the
  absence and presence of oxaliplatin. Right: Quantification of mean γH2A.X foci per
  cell. At least 30 cells per group were included for the counting and quantification.
  *: P < 0.05, ***: P < 0.001, ns: no statistical difference.'
