caption: Comparative analysis of RNA sequencing data. (A) IPA comparative module was
  explored to analyze the RNA sequencing data of differentially expressed genes of
  prostate cancer patients under ADT overlaid with Alzheimer/dementia patient database.
  (B) The identified 33 genes belong to the cytokines gene family along with growth
  factors genes differentially expressed and shared in both data sets. Data represented
  in log2 expression fold change. ADT, androgen deprivation therapy; IPA, ingenuity
  pathway analysis. [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]
