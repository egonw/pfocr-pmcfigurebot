figure_title: The activation of MDM2-p53 signaling pathway in CD44high state induced
  by CCL8
caption: 'A The influence of CCL8 on the expression of CD44 in MCF7 cells was evaluated
  by western blot. The band intensities were analyzed by densitometry analysis. *p < 0.05.
  B Blocking of CCL8 inhibited the acquisition of CD44high state in MCF7 cells induced
  by M2-like macrophages, which was obtained from human monocytic cell line THP-1
  stimulated by PMA/m-CSF/IL-4/IL-10/IL-13. The band intensities were analyzed by
  densitometry analysis. **p < 0.01, ns: no significance. C Scheme of identifying
  differential CD44-interacting peptides upon THP-1-derived M2-like macrophages/CCL8
  stimulation. The intersection showed the CD44-interacting proteins, which were analyzed
  by co-immunoprecipitation-based mass spectrometry assay. MCF7 and T47D cells were
  stimulated by THP-1-derived M2-like macrophages or CCL8 for 3 days, respectively.
  The proteins recruited to CD44 were precipitated by CD44 antibody, and then subject
  to mass spectrometry assay. D Functional associations of the regulatory networks
  of MDM2/p53-correlated genes from analysis of STRING data are presented. E The effects
  of CCL8 on the activation of MDM2 in MCF7 cells were evaluated by immunoblotting
  assay. The band intensities were analyzed by densitometry analysis. *p < 0.05. F
  Blocking of CCL8 inhibited the activation of MDM2 in MCF7 cells induced by THP1-derived
  M2-like macrophages. The band intensities were analyzed by densitometry analysis.
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ns: no significance. G Repression of p53 expression by M2-like
  macrophages in human BrCa cells was detected by immunoblotting assay. The band intensities
  were analyzed by densitometry analysis. *p < 0.05. H Knocking down of MDM2 in primary
  BrCa cells inhibited the up-regulation of CD44 induced by TAMs. The band intensities
  were analyzed by densitometry analysis. ***p < 0.001, ns: no significance. I The
  influence of MDM2 inhibitor on collective dissemination of cell clusters induced
  by TAMs in 2D culture system. Before co-cultured with TAMs on 2D culture system,
  primary BrCa cell clusters were obtained from an ultra-low attachment culture system.
  TAMs were pre-stained with Vybrant CM-DiI (red).'
