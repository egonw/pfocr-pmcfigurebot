figure_title: STEAP2 expression is diminished in PTC tissues
caption: 'A Identification of differentially expressed STEAP family members between
  PTC and normal controls in the TCGA and GEO database (GSE3667, GSE33630, GSE60542,
  GSE35570). B Panel shows representative figures on IHC staining for the 4 STEAP
  family members (STEAP1/2/3/4) and quantitative data. Scale bar: 200 μm. C Risk score
  distribution, survival status scatter plot, and expression patterns of risk genes
  in the TCGA PTC cohort. D Survival analysis based on STEAP2 expression levels in
  TCGA PTC cohort (n = 494). E Distribution of STEAP2 IHC staining scores in PTC tissues
  according to lymph node metastasis status. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001.'
article_title: METTL3-mediated m6A modification of STEAP2 mRNA inhibits papillary
  thyroid cancer progress by blocking the Hedgehog signaling pathway and epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition.
