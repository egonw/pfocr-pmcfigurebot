caption: 'Linkage of PKCδ status to the pentose phosphate pathway. Global metabolomic
  analysis was performed on either Par-C5 cells depleted of PKCδ (shδ110 or shδ680)
  or untargeted control shRNA (shNT) or A549 cells depleted of PKCδ (shδ193 or shδ800)
  or untargeted control shRNA (shSCR). A, schematic of pentose phosphate pathway (PPP).
  B and C, quantification of selected PPP metabolites in Par-C5 cells (B) and A549 cells
  depleted of PKCδ (C). D and E, G6PD activity in Par-C5 and A549 PKCδ depleted cells.
  F and G, NADPH/NADP+ ratio was determined for Par-C5 and A549 PKCδ depleted cells.
  G6PD and NADPH+/NADP+ experiments were repeated a minimum of three times with triplicate
  biological replicates. Data represents the average of a minimum of n = 3 experiments.
  Error bars represent SEM, statistics represent 1-way ANOVA, #p < 0.10, ∗p < 0.05,
  ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001. G6PD, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  PKCδ, protein kinase Cδ.'
