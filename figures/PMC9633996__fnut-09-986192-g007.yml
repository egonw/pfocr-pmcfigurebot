caption: The effect of S-Equol on Pi3K/AKT signaling pathway and OPG/RANKL ratio in
  ROS17/2.8 cells. (A) After 48 h of S-Equol intervention, cell viability was detected
  by CCK8 assay; (B–F) The expression of OPG, RANKL, ERβ, and pAKT/AKT was analyzed
  using the western-blot method. (G–I) The amount of mRNA of OPG, RANKL, and ERβ was
  analyzed using the RT-PCR method. All data are expressed as the mean ± SD (n = 5).
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 as compared to the diabetic osteoporosis (DOP)
  group.
