caption: Sex differences in the renal AMPK/adiponectin pathway in males and females
  in response to a HFD. A Representative Western blotting of total and P-AMPK levels
  in renal cortex tissue. β-Actin was used as internal control. B Relative densitometry
  of the immunoblots representing P-AMPK to AMPK ratio in each group. β-actin was
  used to illustrate protein loading. C Plasma adiponectin level in males and females
  fed a HFD or a LFD at week 16. D Correlation between plasma adiponectin and AMPK
  activity (P-AMPK to AMPK ratio) for all animals. A significant positive linear correlation
  is present. E Representative Western blotting of AdipoR1 level in renal cortex tissue.
  β-actin was used as internal control. F Relative densitometry of the immunoblots
  representing AdipoR1 in each group. G Real-time quantitative PCR analysis for AdipoR1
  gene. mRNA expression was performed with renal cortex tissue from LFD and HFD female
  and male mice and normalized against 18S. Statistical analyses were performed using
  two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey post-test. **p < 0.01. Data are presented as means ± SEM
