caption: The scheme of the Hedgehog pathway in Drosophila (A) and mammals (B). Hh
  Off, absence of the ligand; Hh On, presence of the ligand. The dashed lines show
  the movement of signaling components inside the cell. Arrows indicate the protein
  interactions and modifications. The Hh ligand is secreted by Hh-producing cells
  with the help of Disp and interacts with the Ptc receptor on recipient cells. This
  interaction leads to the removal of the inhibition effect from the other receptor
  Smo. Active Smo provides signal transduction inside the cell, preventing the cleavage
  of the transcription factor Gli/Ci. Full-sized Gli/Ci goes to the nucleus and acts
  as a gene activator [,,,]. For details, see the Results section.
