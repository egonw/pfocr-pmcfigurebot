caption: STAT pathway. After the interaction of the ligands with their corresponding
  receptors, associated tyrosine kinases, such as JAKs, are transphosphorylated to
  then phosphorylate the cytoplasmic tail receptors. Then, STATs are recruited, and
  both are phosphorylated to form dimers that are translocated into the nucleus to
  activate gene transcription (see details in the text).
