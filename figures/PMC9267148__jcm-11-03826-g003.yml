caption: Expressions of CIAPIN1 in CCA cell lines. (a) The protein levels of CIAPIN1
  were determined by western blotting (WB) in CCA cell lines. (b) Relative expression
  of CIAPIN1 in CCA cell lines was examined by WB and the relative expression was
  normalized to β-actin, which is a loading control. The data were presented as the
  mean ± SD from triplicate independent experiments (** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001).
