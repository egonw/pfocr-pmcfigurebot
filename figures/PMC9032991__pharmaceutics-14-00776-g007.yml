caption: 'Bar plots showing the average (mean and SEM) changes in BMD across different
  genotypes combining alleles of two genes: (A) annual change in hip BMD after BP
  therapy across combined FDPS and FNTA genotypes; (B) annual change in spine BMD
  after SERM therapy across combined CYP19A1 and PDSS1 genotypes. Genotypes are divided
  into groups (X-axis) according to the number of risk alleles (that is, alleles associated
  with smaller drug response). The numbers in the bars represent the number of women
  in each group.'
