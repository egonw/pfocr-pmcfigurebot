caption: Fisetin suppressed leukocytes accumulation in DVT mice model. (a–c) Representative
  immunohistochemistry staining for CD45 (leukocyte marker), Ly6G (neutrophil marker),
  and CD68 (macrophages marker). Scale bar, 100 μm (n = 3). The positive cells in
  the thrombi were quantified and presented as average optical density in a thrombus.
  All data are presented as means ± SD. * p < 0.05.
