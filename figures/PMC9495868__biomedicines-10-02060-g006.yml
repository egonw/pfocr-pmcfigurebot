caption: 'Study the effect of high-dose E2 exposure to the cell proliferation, apoptosis
  and cell lysis of the PEO1 cell cultures in the presence of miR-30d-5p mimic or
  AZD8835. Phenotypic characterization of high-dose E2 treatment was made in the PEO1
  cell line in the presence of 50 nM miR-30d-5p mimic (A) or 100 nM AZD8835 (B). The
  rate of cell proliferation, mitochondrial membrane potential (24 h and 48 h after
  the treatment), and LDH activities (48 h after the treatment) were determined relative
  to the non-treated control (1). Data are presented as the mean Â± S.D. a: p < 0.05;
  b: p < 0.01; c: p < 0.001; d: p < 0.0001.'
