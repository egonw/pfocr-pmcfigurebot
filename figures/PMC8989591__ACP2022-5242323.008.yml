caption: 'In the cell model of hypoxia/reoxygenation, TGF-β was knocked out, and exogenous
  ALK4 protein was added. HE staining of heart tissues. The aging condition: ALK4+/−
  + I/R group = ALK4+/− + I/R and TGFb group > ALK4+/− + sham group. Evans blue and
  TTC staining found no significant change in myocardial infarction area after addition
  of TGF-β, followed by detection of SOD, MDA, CK, LDH, AST, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β.
  There was no significant difference between ALK4+/-+I/R and TGF-β groups, and it
  was significantly higher than the ALK4+/-+sham groups. (a–h) Antioxidation-related
  indicators and inflammation-related indicators TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1. (i) HE staining.
  (j) Evans Blue and TTC double staining.'
