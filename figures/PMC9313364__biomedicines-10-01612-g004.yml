caption: 'CCL4 promotes Angpt2 expression and angiogenesis by activating MEK and ERK
  signaling. (A) SCC4 cells were incubated with CCL4 (30 μg/mL) for the indicated
  time intervals, then MEK and ERK activation was examined by Western blot. (B) SCC4
  cells were treated with a MEK inhibitor (PD98059, 10 μM) or ERK inhibitor (U0126,
  10 μM) for 30 min, or transfected with MEK or ERK siRNAs for 24 h, then stimulated
  with CCL4 (30 μg/mL) for 24 h. Levels of ANGPT2 mRNA were examined by qPCR. (C)
  SCC4 cells were treated with a MEK inhibitor (PD98059, 10 μM) or ERK inhibitor (U0126,
  10 μM) for 30 min, or transfected with MEK or ERK siRNAs for 24 h, then stimulated
  with CCL4 (30 μg/mL) for 24 h. CM was applied to EPCs for 16 h. Capillary-like structure
  formation was examined by the tube formation assay. (D) SCC4 cells were treated
  with a MEK inhibitor (PD98059, 10 μM) or ERK inhibitor (U0126, 10 μM) for 30 min,
  or transfected with MEK or ERK siRNAs for 24 h, then stimulated with CCL4 (30 μg/mL)
  for 24 h. CM was applied to the EPCs for 24 h. EPC migratory ability was examined
  by the Transwell migration assay. Each experiment was performed three times. * p
  < 0.05 compared with controls; # p < 0.05 compared with the CCL4-treated group (30
  μg/mL).'
