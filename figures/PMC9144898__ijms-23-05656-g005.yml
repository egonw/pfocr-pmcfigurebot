caption: Silica activated the ER stress, TLR4-NF-κB pathway as well as inflammatory
  response in macrophages. (A–M) Expression levels of p-PERK, p-eIF-2α, p-IRE-1α,
  TLR4, MyD88, p-IκBα, p-NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β in MH-S cells treated with
  SiO2 at different doses measured by Western blot. * Compared with control group,
  p < 0.05. Data are presented as the mean ± SD, n = 3 per group.
