caption: The effect of HAL, PLEC and MRC on apoptosis induction in MCF7 and FaDu cancer
  cells. Values are means ± SD (n = 3). *** p < 0.001 vs. control group (upper panel
  A). The graph shows % apoptotic cells as the sum of cells in early and late apoptosis.
  The dot plots show (lower panel B) results of one representative experiment for
  each kind of cells treated with HAL, PLEC, MRC. Q2 and Q3 quadrant presents a fraction
  of late and early apoptotic cells, respectively.
