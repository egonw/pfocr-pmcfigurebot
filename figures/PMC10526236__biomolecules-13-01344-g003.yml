caption: The hsa_circ_0000479/hsa-miR-149/RIG-I, IL-6 axis regulates SARS-CoV-2 infection.
  Up-expressed hsa_circ_0000479 could modulate the expression of IL-6 and RIG-I through
  sponging of hsa-miR-149â€“5p. On the one hand, activation of the RIG-I signaling pathway
  promotes the release of IFN-I, which exerts antiviral effects. On the other hand,
  the expression level of IL-6 is associated with lung inflammation and extensive
  lung injury.
