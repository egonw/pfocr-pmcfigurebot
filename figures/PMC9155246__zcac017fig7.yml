caption: EHF Represses NRF2 and NRF2 Target Genes. (A) Dotplot showing the distribution
  of all the genes from the human HNSCC scRNA-seq data that re enriched in NRF2 pathway.
  (B) Heatmap showing the expression NRF2 pathway genes following the overexpression
  (A253 and SCC25) or loss (CAL-27) of EHF. Genes missing in any cell line heatmap
  are not expressed in that particular cell line. (C)Â Western blot showing the expression
  of NRF2 following inducible and stable EHF expression in both A253 and SCC25 cells.
  (D) Western blot showing the expression of NFR2 following the loss of EHF in CAL-27
  cells. (E) ChIP-seq data from CAL-27 shows that EHF binds multiple regulatory regions
  within the NRF2 gene. Genes missing in any panel are not expressed in that particular
  cell line.
article_title: EHF is a novel regulator of cellular redox metabolism and predicts
  patient prognosis in HNSCC.
