figure_title: PA28γ can bind to MEK1 and activate the MEK1/ERK signaling pathway
caption: 'A, B HA-tagged MEK1 and Flag-tagged PA28γ plasmids were transfected into
  293T cells, and immunoprecipitation experiments showed that PA28γ and MEK1 have
  a direct interaction relationship. Immunoprecipitation of MEK1 was performed with
  the HA-MEK1 antibody. C, D Coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that endogenous PA28γ
  and endogenous MEK1 could bind to each other. Immunoprecipitation of PA28γ was performed
  with the anti-PA28γ or anti-Flag antibody. E, F Representative results of the coimmunostaining
  of Flag-PA28γ (red) and endogenous MEK1 (green) in epithelial cells. The nuclei
  were stained blue with DAPI. Scale bar: 50 μm. G After the Flag-tagged PA28γ plasmid
  was transfected into 293T cells in a dose-dependent manner, western blot assays
  showed that the expression levels of p-MEK1 and p-ERK were upregulated. H Western
  blot assays showed that the epithelial cells were treated with siRNA-PA28γ, siRNA-MEK1,
  or siNC.'
