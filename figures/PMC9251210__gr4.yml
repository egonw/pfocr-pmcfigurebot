caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) of canonical pathways altered after treatment
  with LV-IFNαIPA analysis of significant genes (FDR cutoff 0.05 and fold change of
  2) was performed to identify top candidate canonical pathways with a positive Z
  score in BBN975 (A), MB49 (B), and UPPL1541 (C). Pathways that are common to all
  three cell lines are indicated by green bars, and pathways common between MB49 and
  UPPL1541 are shown in red.
