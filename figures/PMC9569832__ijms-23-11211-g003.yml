caption: 'Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) in the SBH/y model of cerebral small
  vessel disease (CSVD). GSEA of differential expression between SBH/y- DS (n = 4)
  and SBH/y sham (n = 4) demonstrates that the following gene sets were upregulated
  in our model: inflammatory response (A), regulation of immune response (B), immune
  response regulating signaling pathway (C), innate (D) and adaptive (E) immune response,
  T cell activation (F), cytokine production (G), lymphocyte activation (H), and positive
  regulation of immune system process (I). Green curves show the accumulating enrichment
  score. Normalized enrichment score (NES) and false discovery ratio (FDR) are shown
  for each gene set analyzed.'
