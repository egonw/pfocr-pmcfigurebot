figure_title: LncRNA MCF2L-AS1 regulated the IGF2/MEK/ERK signaling pathway through
  interacting with IGF2BP1
caption: (A, B) RNA pull-down and RIP assay were employed to verify the binding relationship
  between lncRNA MCF2L-AS1 and IGF2BP1. (C, D) IGF2BP1 expression was assessed by
  qRT-PCR and western blot. Cisplatin-resistant cells were transfected with sh-NC
  or sh-MCF2L-AS1. (E) The mRNA level of IGF2BP1 was determined using qRT-PCR. (F)
  IGF2BP1, IGF2, p-MEK, MEK, p-ERK and ERK levels were evaluated using western blot.
  The data were expressed as mean ± SD. All data were obtained from at least 3 replicate
  experiments.ERK, extracellular regulated protein kinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; IGF2, insulin-like growth factor 2; IGF2BP1, insulin-like growth
  factor-2 mRNA binding protein 1; IgG, immunoglobulin G; MEK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase kinase; NC, normal control; qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time polymerase chain
  reaction; RIP, RNA immunoprecipitation; SD, standard deviation; sh-, short hairpin
