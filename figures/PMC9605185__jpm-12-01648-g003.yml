caption: Smo-dependent Hh signalling (created with BioRender.com (accessed on 28 September
  2020)). (a) The canonical pathway. Binding of Hh ligand to Ptc removes Ptc from
  the primary cilium ① and releases Smo from inhibition. This stimulates accumulation
  of the receptor on the surface membrane due to increased trafficking of Smo-containing
  intracellular vesicles ②. The C-tail of Smo is then phosphorylated by CK1α and GRK2
  ③, which facilitates ciliary accumulation of the receptor ④. In the primary cilium,
  Smo interacts with Evc/Evc2. This releases Gli from inhibition by SUFU ⑤. Gli moves
  into the nucleus, where it gets converted into GliA ⑥. GliA activates transcription
  of the Hh target genes. (b) Type II non-canonical signalling. Hh binding to Ptc
  releases inhibition of Smo, which allows it to interact with Gi. This triggers dissociation
  of Gi into ⍺ and β     subunits. The latter activates PLC    . This leads to production
  of IP3, which triggers calcium spikes through the opening of Ca2+ channels in the
  ER. Gβ     also activates PI3K. This stimulates RhoA and Rac to trigger cytoskeleton
  rearrangements. Finally, Gβ     stimulates assembly of the CARMA-BCL-10-MALT1 complex,
  which stimulates the release of NF-κB from its inhibitor (IκB). NF-κB translocates
  into the nucleus, where it induces expression of its own target genes.
