caption: Classic pathway for cholesterol conversion to bile acids. Cholesterol (1)
  is acted on by the 7α-hydroxylase CYP7A1 and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD)
  to generate the common bile acid precursor 7α-hydroxycholest-4-en-3-one (3). In
  the presence of CYP8B1, this common intermediate is 12α-hydroxylated to yield 7α,12α-dihydroxycholest-4-en-3-one
  (4), which is subsequently modified on the A ring and side chain to generate cholic
  acid (5). In the absence of CYP8B1 catalysis, the common 7α-hydroxy-cholest-4-en-3-one
  intermediate (3) directly undergoes the same modifications of the A ring and side
  chain to generate chenodeoxycholic acid (6). The resulting primary bile acids cholic
  acid and chenodeoxycholic acid thus differ only by the 12-OH installed by CYP8B1,
  but have substantially different lipid absorption and signaling profiles. CYP8B1,
  cytochrome P450 8B1.

  the human cytochrome P450 8B1 active site by tryptophan 281.
