caption: 'Angelica Yinzi suppresses the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. (A) The NLRP3,
  ASC, and Caspase-1 expression in the skin tissue based on the immunohistochemical
  staining at magnification × 200. (B-C) The expression IL-1β proteins were determined
  by Western blot analysis, and gray values were calculated. Data are expressed as
  the mean ± SD. (n = 3). ##p < 0.01, vs. the control group. *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01
  vs. the DNCB group.'
