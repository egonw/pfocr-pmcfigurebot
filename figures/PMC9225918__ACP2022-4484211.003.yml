caption: Anlotinib combined with 5-FU induced cell cycle arrest in the H446 cells
  using cell cycle kit. (a) The H446 cells were treatment with anlotinib (5 μM) and
  5-FU (10 μM) or combination of both for 24 h. (b) The cell cycle rate (%) including
  G1\G0, S and G2\M. All experiments were repeated three times. The bars represent
  mean ± SEM of the three independent experiments.∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 compared
  with anlotinib.
