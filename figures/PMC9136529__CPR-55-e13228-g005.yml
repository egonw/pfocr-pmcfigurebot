caption: 'Decreased cell proliferation due to Wnt/β‐catenin inhibition aggravates
  necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). (A) Changes in body weight of rats in DM, NEC,
  NEC‐L and NEC‐H groups. (B) Tissue damage scoring of rat ileum. (C) The H&E staining
  (Up) and PCNA (Brown)(Down) immunohistochemistry staining of rat ileum (×400). (D)
  DX‐4000‐FITC levels in the serum of DM, NEC, NEC‐L and NEC‐H groups. (E) Western
  blot analysis of PCNA and the key proteins in Wnt/β‐catenin signalling pathway in
  rat ileal tissue. (F) Correlation analysis among bile acids. Blank squares: p >0.05.
  Marked with red or blue (p <0.05) were the significant correlations. Positive correlations
  were shown in red; negative correlations were shown in blue. (G,H) Analysis of LCA
  levels in ileum tissues of DM, NEC, NEC‐L and NEC‐H groups. *p <0.05; **p <0.01;
  ***p <0.001; ns, not significant. p values were obtained by one‐way ANOVA or Kruskal–Wallis
  test'
