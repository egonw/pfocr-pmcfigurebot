caption: MSCs and MSC-exosomes promote migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transformation
  in the polyploid A549 and H1299 cells. (a, b) The CFSE proliferation analysis of
  the polyploid A549 and H1299 cells following coculture with MSC-CM, MSCs, and MSC-exosomes
  was examined by flow cytometry at 0 hour, 48 hours, and 72 hours. (c, d) The quantitative
  analysis of migration ability of the polyploid A549 and H1299 cells following coculture
  with MSC-CM, MSCs, and MSC-exosomes was examined by transwell assay at 48 hours.
  (e) The expressions of ECAD, NCAD, and VIM in the polyploid A549 and H1299 cells
  following c-culture with MSC-CM, MSCs, and MSC-exosomes were detected by RT-qPCR
  analysis at 48 hours.
