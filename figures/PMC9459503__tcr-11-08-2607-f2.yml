caption: The correlation between KMT2D and PPARγ is obtained through bioinformatics.
  (A,B) Differentially expressed genes were screened in groups [patients with high
  and low KMT2D expression groups (cut 50%), n=496], and functional enrichment analysis
  of DEGs was performed, including (A) GO enrichment analysis and (B) KEGG enrichment
  analysis. The results showed that KMT2D is associated with lipid metabolism and
  fatty acid metabolic pathways. (C) Spearman correlation analysis of KMT2D with fatty
  acid metabolic signaling pathway genes showed a significant positive correlation
  between KMT2D expression and FASN, ACC, SCD and ACLY. Errors are expressed as standard
  deviation. ***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001. KMT2D, kinase tethers histone-lysine N-methyltransferase
