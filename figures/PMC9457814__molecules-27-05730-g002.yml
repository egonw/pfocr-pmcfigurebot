caption: 'The function of AR signaling in prostate cancer and development: (A) Prostate
  homeostasis is maintained in a healthy prostate via reciprocal signaling between
  the stromal and epithelial layers; (B) normal prostate cells are converted into
  cancer initiating cells by unknown mechanisms, histological evidence of prostatic
  intraepithelial neoplasia and early cancer lesions appears, cells at the basal layer
  express higher levels of AR in response to this event; (C) cellular and molecular
  alterations occur in prostate adenocarcinoma, resulting in luminal cells with the
  AR transcriptional pathway; (D) Prostate cancer cells in CRPC maintain AR activity
  through other mechanisms (including upregulation of AR and its splice variants,
  intra-tumoral androgen synthesis, cross communicate with other signal pathways,
  and increased/altered expression of AR cofactors) as the availability of androgen
  from the blood steam becomes limited [].'
