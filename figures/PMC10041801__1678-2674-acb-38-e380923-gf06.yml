figure_title: Transcriptome sequencing of B3GNT3 in ESCC cell lines. (a) Coorder Venn
  diagram between samples; (b) principal component analysis (PCA); (c) Gene Ontology
  gene function enrichment analysis. Rich factor represents the proportion of enriched
  differential genes in the background genes of the pathway, and the abscissa is the
  name of the pathway with higher enrichment degree
