caption: Regulation of EGFR/PI3K/p-AKT signaling pathway mediated by SK via GPER in
  SKOV3 and A2780 cells. (a) The expression of EGFR, p-EGFR, PI3K, AKT and p-AKT following
  G-1 and G-15 treatment together with 8.6 μM SK in SKOV3 cells. (b) The expression
  of EGFR, p-EGFR, PI3K, AKT, and p-AKT following G-1 and G-15 treatment together
  with 0.56 μM SK in A2780 cells. The results are means of three independent replicates ± S.D.∗∗P
  < 0.01 or ∗P < 0.05 vs. control group, △△P < 0.01 or △P < 0.05 vs. SK treatment
  group were considered as statistically significant.
