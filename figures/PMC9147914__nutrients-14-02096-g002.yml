caption: 'Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) biosynthesis pathways by the gut microbiota.
  The different pathways involved in SCFA production are presented for acetate, butyrate,
  and propionate. SCFA-producing bacteria for each pathway are also shown. Acetate
  is mainly produced in the gut from pyruvate via acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA). Three pathways
  have been described for propionate synthesis, namely acrylate, succinate, and propanediol.
  The first two start from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and the latter uses deoxysugars,
  such as fucose and rhamnose. Butyrate is produced via two pathways: the butyryl-CoA:
  acetate CoA-transferase and the butyrate kinase.'
