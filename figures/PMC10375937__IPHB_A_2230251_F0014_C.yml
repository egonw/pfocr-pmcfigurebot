caption: The figure depicts the overall effect of AA on C2C12 myotubes in the LPS-stimulated
  MyD88dependent TLR4 signaling pathway. The diagram shows how TLR4-downstream signaling
  was monitored in C2C12 in response to LPS stimulation using both HCS and WB analysis.
  HCS was applied to MyD88, NF-κB, and JNK (immunocytochemistry). TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB,
  and p38 were all exposed to WB (Immunoblotting). Starting from the left, the groups
  are LPS (1 µg/mL), LPS(1 µg/mL) + PDTC (25 µM), LPS (1 µg/mL) + AA (50, 75 and 100 µM).
