caption: eEF2K silencing by pharmacological or genetic means reverses the antiproliferative
  effects of PI3Ki plus MEKi cotreatment in cell models that responded synergistically
  to cotreatment. A, scheme applied for NTERA2 cells. The signaling pathways PI3K/mTOR
  and MAPK negatively regulate eEF2K, thereby allowing for eEF2 activity to promote
  protein translation. With the individual addition of MEKi or PI3Ki into the cell
  culture, eEF2K still remains inactive, facilitating translation elongation. Only
  the combined therapy (B) leads to a full eEF2K activation and further eEF2 phosphorylation,
  slowing down the elongation stage of protein synthesis. B, phosphorylation of pathway
  activity markers in cells pretreated with an eEF2Ki for 24 h or transfected with
  nontarget siRNA or siRNA against eEF2K for 3 days. C and D, reduction in cell numbers
  (measured using a Guava assay) in cells in which eEF2K was silenced as in (A) and
  (B), followed by treatment with PI3Ki or MEKi individually or in combination for
  further 3 days at the concentrations shown. Values are mean ± SEM (n = 3 independent
  experiments). Statistical significance was calculated by two-way ANOVA, ∗p < 0.05,
  ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001. DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; eEF2, eukaryotic elongation
  factor 2; eEF2K, eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin.
