caption: 'Tetrandrine (Tet) recovers the renal dysfunction and podocyte injury in
  adriamycin- (ADR-) induced nephropathy rats. (a) The levels of 24-hour urine protein
  and renal function indexes (serum creatinine, plasma albumin, and urea nitrogen)
  in rats. ∗∗P < 0.01 versus the control group. #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01 versus the
  ADRIA group. (b) Process fusion (red arrows) of podocytes was identified via electron
  microscopy (scale bar = 1 μm). Nephropathy rats were induced by adriamycin (ADRIA)
  and then treated with low-dose (LD), medium-dose (MD), high-dose (HD) Tet, or cyclosporine
  A (CsA, a positive drug).'
