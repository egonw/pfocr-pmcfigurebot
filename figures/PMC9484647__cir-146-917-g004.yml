caption: Chromosomal locations (A) and functional pathways (B) of candidate causal
  genes. A, Boxes designate different chromosomes that are numbered from 1 to 22,
  with cytogenetic bands shown inside each box and chromosomal positions labeled by
  tick marks placed every 25 million bp. Lines on the outer aspect of the boxes symbolize
  coronary artery disease–associated variants that had expression quantitative trait
  locus (eQTL) or splicing quantitative trait locus (sQTL) effects in vascular smooth
  muscle cells. Each locus with both cis-eQTL and cis-sQTL effects is indicated by
  a red line, and each locus with only cis-eQTL is indicated by a green line. B, Dot
  plot showing identified functional pathways with enrichment of some of the candidate
  causal genes. Data shown are from a pathway analysis performed with ToppGene. FDR
  indicates false discovery rate. *Originally identified in cancer. **Originally identified
  in osteogenesis imperfecta.
