caption: Overexpression of ZmGLP1 in Arabidopsis enhances resistance to PstDC3000
  through the jasmonic-acid-mediated signaling pathway. (A) Jasmonic acid contents
  in the different groups after PstDC3000 infection. (B) Phenotypes of the different
  groups at 7 d post PstDC3000 infection, which were pretreated with DIECA for 24
  h. (C) Disease indexes of the different groups. (D) Trypan blue staining and DAB
  staining of the different groups. (E) Detection of H2O2 content of Arabidopsis leaves
  at 3 d post PstDC3000 infection in different groups shown in (B). Different letters
  in subfigures (A,C,E) indicated significant difference between different samples
  by Duncan’s post-hoc test.Data are presented as the mean ± SD based on three biological
  replicates.
