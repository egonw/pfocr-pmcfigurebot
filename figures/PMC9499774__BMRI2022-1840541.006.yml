caption: SH005S7 inhibits RTK signaling in the xenograft mouse model. (a) Western
  blot analysis of EMT and RTK signaling pathway in xenografts. (b) H&E and immunohistochemical
  staining results of RTKs on tumor sections (magnification ×400). Representative
  graph showing IHC quantification. The results were shown as means ± S.D. from three
  independent experiments. Error bars are S.D. (∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p <
  0.001 versus control).
