caption: PDZK1 is one of the HBV-infection-related oncogenes in human HCC. (a) Venny
  map indicating the common up- or downregulated genes both in cancer and normal samples
  from TCGA-LIHC. (b) Heat map reflating either R or P value obtained from multiple
  correlation study between HBV reads and gene expression level of common genes. (c)
  Scatter plot reflecting the correlation between HBV reads and PDZK1 expression in
  the TCGA samples. (d) The comparison of PDZK1 expression between normal and tumor
  samples from TCGA-LIHC or TCGA-LIHC and GTEx database. (e) Real-time PCR detection
  PDZK1 transcription in the sample sets indicated in the figure. (f) Scatter plot
  reflecting the correlation between HBV reads and PDZK1 expression from clinical
  samples.
