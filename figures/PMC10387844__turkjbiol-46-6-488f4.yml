caption: 'Common metabolic gene expression pattern in cisplatin-treated and DR5-AS
  knockdown HeLa cells. The GSE160227 RNA-seq data of DR5-AS knockdown cells were
  reanalyzed to have count matrix with featureCounts in conda environment. Count matrix
  was further processed by DESeq2 and (A) Heatmap of top 1000 DEGs was generated with
  pheatmap package in R. (B) Reactome pathway analysis of signal transduction pathways
  in DR5-AS knockdown cells was performed with genes associated with metabolic pathways.
  (C) Venn diagram of metabolism-related DEGs in DR5-AS knockdown and cisplatin-treated
  HeLa cells. (D) qPCR analyses of metabolism-related genes differentially expressed
  in DR5-AS knockdown HeLa cells. 1000 ng RNA was used for cDNA synthesis and GAPDH
  was used for normalization. ns: nonsignificant, p > 0.05, *: p ≤ 0.05, **: p ≤ 0.01,
  ***: p ≤ 0.001, ****: p ≤ 0.0001.'
