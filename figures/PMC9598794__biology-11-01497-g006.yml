caption: FABP3 regulated adipogenic differentiation by PPAR signalling pathway. (A)
  ORO staining and quantification between NC and FABP3-siRNA (top), miR-381-3p mimics
  (middle) and inhibitor (bottom); (B) fluorescence staining of lipid droplet following
  transfection of lncRNA4789 overexpression, lncRNA4789 inhibitor, lncRNA4789 overexpression
  NC and lncRNA4789 inhibitor NC; cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) while
  lipid droplets were stained green with BODIPYâ„¢ 493/503; (C) mRNA expression of related
  genes involved in the PPAR signalling pathway, following miR-381-3p overexpression;
  (D) mRNA expression of related genes involved in the PPAR signalling pathway following
  transfection with an lncRNA4789 inhibitor; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
