caption: 'The potential targets and pathways between COPD and HUA. A The Venn diagram
  showing the shared genes between COPD and HUA. B The protein interaction network
  of 27 common genes. C The bar plot showing the GO enrichment of core common genes
  including CC, MP and CM. D The bar rplot showing the cellular component terms in
  GO enrichment. E The bubble plot showing the KEGG enrichment of common genes. F The
  hub-genes among the core 27 shared genes. G The Venn diagram showing the shared
  genes between AECOPD and HUA. H The hub-genes among the common 9 genes. Abbreviation:
  CC, cell component; BP, biological process; MF, molecular function; AECOPD, Acute
  Exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease; HUA, hyperuricemia; COPD,
  chronic obstruction pulmonary disease'
