figure_title: Identification of RCAN1 as an age-associated factor in reprogrammed
  MSNs from longitudinally collected fibroblasts
caption: 'a, Experimental scheme of RNA-sequencing in fibroblasts and reprogrammed
  MSNs (young and old) from three independent longitudinal groups (individual I, II,
  III). MSNs were reprogrammed by overexpressing miR-9/9* and miR-124 (miR-9/9*-124)
  as well as MSN-defining transcription factors, CTIP2, DLX1, DLX2, and MYT1L (CDM).
  b, Representative images of fibroblasts of young and old longitudinal groups marked
  by S100A4 (left) and reprogrammed MSNs marked by DARPP-32 from three individuals.
  c, Quantification of DARPP-32 positive cells from reprogrammed MSNs from all samples
  (n=4~5 replicates per sample from 6 individuals). An average of 300 cells were counted
  from four or more randomly chosen fields. Scale bars represent 20 μm. d, Gene Ontology
  (GO) enrichment analysis of all DEGs in two replicates of old-fibroblasts (left)
  and old-MSNs (right) from three independent individuals (FDR<0.05, ∣FC∣≥1.5). e,
  GO enrichment analysis of up-/down-regulated genes commonly manifested in old-MSNs
  compared to young-MSNs (FDR<0.05, ∣FC∣≥1.5). f, Upstream regulator analysis of up-/down-regulated
  genes in old-MSNs in (e). g, Representative Immunoblotting (top) and quantification
  (bottom) of RCAN1 in six longitudinal MSNs and six fibroblasts (young and old) from
  three independent individuals (n=6 replicates). The quantification is normalized
  to values from young samples per line. h. Representative immunoblotting (top) and
  quantification (bottom) of RCAN1 expression in eight human striatum samples aged
  23, 35, 39, 36 (young) and 69, 74, 78, 77 (old) years old (n=8 individuals). i,
  Representative immunoblotting (top) and quantification (bottom) of RCAN1 expression
  in three reprogrammed MSNs from presymptomatic patients aged 44, 16, 23 years old
  (pre-HD-MSN: Pre-HD.42, Pre-HD.45, Pre-HD.40/50) and three reprogrammed MSNs from
  symptomatic patients aged 63, 71, 55 years old (HD-MSN: HD.47, HD.40, HD.45) (n=6
  replicates). Statistical significance was determined using one-way ANOVA (c) and
  unpaired t-test (g,h,i); **p<0.01, *p<0.05, ns, not significant and mean±s.e.m.
  The sample size (n) corresponds to the number of biological replicates.'
