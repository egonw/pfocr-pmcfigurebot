caption: 'RAVER1 is a key regulator of alternative splicing in the miR/RISC pathway.
  (A) Scheme of essential facilitators of miR-processing and miR/RISC activity in
  gene silencing, as derived from (,). The color code indicates significantly enhanced
  (red), decreased (blue), non-significantly altered (gray) mRNA expression upon RAVER1
  knockdown. Black shape outlines indicate at least one significant AS event for the
  respective genes in response to RAVER1 depletion in A549 cells. For details, please
  refer to . (B) Sashimi plot of TNRC6B splicing in RAVER1-depleted A549 cells, as
  determined by rMATS. (C) Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of alternative splicing
  of exon 6 in TNRC6B (scheme in left panel) in response to indicated knockdowns (upper
  panel) and the re-expression of SBP/FLAG-tagged RAVER1 in the KO1 clone. (D) Scheme
  of GW-rich clusters in the AGO-binding regions of TNRC6 proteins with alternatively
  spliced exons (light purple) and altered GW content upon alternative transcript
  processing. (E) Representative Western blot (upper panel) showing copurification
  of schematically depicted (left lower panel) TNRC6B protein fragments with immunopurified
  GFP-AGO2. TNRC6B proteins include (T6B) or lack (BΔEx6) the GW-rich exon 6, which
  is alternatively spliced upon RAVER1 knockdown. Quantification of TNRC6B protein
  copurification determined in three independent studies by normalization to purified
  GFP-AGO2 amounts is shown in a bar diagram (lower right panel). Error bars show
  standard deviation and statistical significance was determined by Student''s t-test:
  (***) P < 0.001.'
