caption: '(A) Heatmap of RNA Expression Changes Associated with TRAF3/CYLD Alterations
  and Deletions. Normalized log2(read counts per million), color scaled by row. Columns–
  Tumor Samples, organized by unguided clustering. Rows – Top 100 genes by p-value
  differentially expressed between high-confidence NF-κB active vs. inactive tumors
  (see methods for details). Row annotation – Known NF-κB target genes curated from
  literature review. Column Annotation Details: Track 1 (green) - RNA classifier (“NF-κB
  active”) based on nearest centroid. Track 2 (green brown) - RNA classifier (“NF-κB
  highly active”) based on minimal classifier score identified for TRAF3/CYLD nonsense
  or frameshift mutation bearing tumors. Track 3 (orange) – Tumor contains a frameshift,
  nonsense, or deep deletion in TRAF3 or CYLD. Track 4 (purple) - Tumor contains a
  frameshift or nonsense mutation in TRAF3. Track 5 (lavender) - Tumor contains a
  deep deletion in TRAF3. Track 6 (pink) - Tumor contains a shallow deletion in TRAF3.
  Track 7 (army green) - Tumor contains a frameshift or nonsense mutation in CYLD.
  Track 8 (lime green) - Tumor contains a missense mutation in CYLD. Track 9 (yellow)
  - Tumor contains a deep deletion in CYLD. Track 10 (mustard) - Tumor contains a
  shallow deletion in CYLD. Track 11 (dark brown) – Tumor contains any alteration
  in both TRAF3 and CYLD. Shallow Deletion – Gistic copy-number score = −1, Deep Deletion
  – Gistic copy-number score = −2, Stop Gained – frameshift or nonsense mutation.
  Missense – missense or in frame indel. Stop/Deep Del. – Any one of nonsense, frameshift,
  or deep deletion. (B) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis for NF-κB Target Genes. All available
  genes after data filtering (see methods) were ranked according to signal-to-noise
  ratio when comparing the two groups of tumors. The MiSigDB Hallmark TNFA/NFkB gene
  set was tested for enrichment. NF-κB highly active – tumors were defined according
  to RNA based classifications (see methods); these were compared to all other tumors
  in the study cohort. NF-κB Pathway Alteration – Any missense, nonsense, frameshift,
  deep deletion in TRAF3 and/or CYLD; these were compared to all other tumors in the
  study cohort. Lines – enrichment score values. Dashed Line – maximum achieved enrichment
  score (NFkB high activity only). Vertical Hashes – rank positions of the test gene
  set (Hallmark NF-κB). (C) Auto-correlation of RNA Gene Set before and after the
  machine learning (ML) procedure. (D) Classifier Performance of Gene Sets before
  and after ML improvement, with increasing (simulated) error of measurement. Performance
  determined by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. ***P value
  < 5 × 10−4, **P value < 5 × 10−3.'
