figure_title: c-Met is overexpressed and associated with PNI in pancreatic cancer
caption: A Representative histopathology (H&E staining) and IHC staining (S100β, c-Met,
  N-cadherin, and NGF) of pancreatic cancer tissue with or without PNI. B The positive
  correlation of c-Met expression with N-cadherin expression. The numbers of overlapping
  scores were labeled at the right of each point. C The positive correlation of c-Met
  expression with NGF expression. The numbers of overlapping scores were labeled at
  the right of each point. D The expression of c-Met in pancreatic cancer tissue with
  PNI and without PNI. E The expression of N-cadherin in pancreatic cancer tissue
  with PNI and without PNI. F The expression of NGF in pancreatic cancer tissue with
  PNI and without PNI. G Expression of c-Met in tumor tissues in the TCGA database
  to match TCGA normal and GTEx data. H The forest graph shows the HR and its 95%
  CI of the OS for c-Met in pancreatic cancer patients according to the TCGA database.
  I Overall survival of patients with pancreatic cancer and different levels of c-Met.
  J Disease-free survival of patients with pancreatic cancer and different levels
  of c-Met. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.
article_title: HGF/c-Met pathway facilitates the perineural invasion of pancreatic
  cancer by activating the mTOR/NGF axis.
