caption: 'Neuro-pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease. (A) Substantia nigra (black
  substance): patients in late stages of Parkinson’s disease (PD) lose more than half
  of the dopaminergic neurons in this region. (B) Intracellular Lewy body inclusions
  in dopaminergic neurons, a characteristic hallmark sign of PD. (C) Dopamine is obtained
  from diet-derived L-tyrosine; L-tyrosine is catalyzed to produce L-DOPA by tyrosine
  hydroxylase (TH) and guanosine triphosphate cyclohydroxylase I (CGH1), which is
  in turn decarboxylated to dopamine by aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC).
  (D) Nigrostriatal pathway: connects nigral neurons to the striatum and aids with
  dopamine transport within the basal ganglia.'
