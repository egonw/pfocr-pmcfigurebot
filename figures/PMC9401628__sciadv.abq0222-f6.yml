figure_title: PEMF-induced Ca2+ oscillations activate the Ras/MAPK/AP-1 signaling
  axis and thereby regulate Ku70 transcription in irradiated osteoblasts
caption: (A and B) RNA-seq showing the significant enrichment of KRAS signaling in
  irradiated osteoblasts under PEMF stimulation for 2 hours. (C) Western blotting
  for the expression of kinase proteins in the Ras/MAPK pathway (n = 6). (D and E)
  Expression of kinase proteins in the Ras/MAPK pathway in irradiated osteoblasts
  infected with shIFT88 lentivirus or pretreated with thapsigargin (n = 6). (F) RNA-seq
  showing increased AP-1 signaling expression. (G) Western blotting for the phosphorylated
  c-Fos and c-Jun expression (n = 6). (H) AP-1 protein expression in irradiated osteoblasts
  infected with shIFT88 lentivirus (n = 6). (I) Schematic representation of the AP-1
  promoter region (~1100 bp). Green box indicates the luciferase gene location. Bar
  graph indicates the relative luciferase activity of TRUNC0, TRUNC1, and TRUNC2 promoter
  regions. PGL3-basic is the negative control. (J) Relative luciferase activity analysis
  of TRUNC0, TRUNC1, and TRUNC2 (n = 6). (K and L) Relative luciferase activity and
  ChIP analyses in irradiated osteoblasts pretreated with the AP-1 inhibitor (SR11302,
  10 μΜ) (n = 6). (M to O) Western blotting for the AP-1 and Ku70 expression in irradiated
  osteoblasts pretreated with the inhibitor of AP-1 (SR11302, 10 μΜ), Ras (FTS, 50
  μM), or SERCA (thapsigargin, 1 μM) (n = 6). Graphs represent means ± SD. (I) **P
  < 0.01 versus the TRUNC0 group by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s posttest. (J to
  L) **P < 0.01. Statistical analyses were done using two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s
  posttest.
