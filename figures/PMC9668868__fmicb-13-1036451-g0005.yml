caption: Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis depict the regulatory pathway
  of N and P addition on plant diversity, bacterial composition, bacterial richness
  (Chao 1 index), and bacterial diversity (Shannon index). The solid black arrow lines
  represent positive effects, solid red arrow lines represent negative effects. Adjacent
  numbers labeled in the same direction as the arrow represent standardized path coefficients.
  Values of R2 indicate the proportion of variance explained by each variable in the
  model. *Indicates P < 0.05, **indicates P < 0.01, and ***indicates P < 0.001.
article_title: Soil properties rather than plant diversity mediate the response of
  soil bacterial community to N and P additions in an alpine meadow.
