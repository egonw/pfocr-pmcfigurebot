caption: Structures of gangliosides. The map is drawn based on the de novo metabolic
  pathway of gangliosides and limited to the species that are discussed in the current
  work (GM3, GM1, GD1a/b, and GT1a/b/c). Other profiled gangliosides are the species
  that we profiled and identified in the biological samples.
