caption: Effect of CGF on cell proliferation and migration ability by activating MEK/ERK
  signaling in HSF cells. (a) The effect of CGF on cell death in HSF cells at different
  dosages. (b) EdU assays of HSF cells treated with CGF were performed to evaluate
  cell proliferative ability. (c) Wound healing assays were performed in HSF cells
  treated with CGF at different dosages. (d, e) The protein levels of Col1A1, Col3A1,
  TIMP-1, MMP-3, C-fos, E-cadherin, vimentin, p-MEK1/2, MEK1/2, p-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2
  to be measured after treatment of CGF in HSF cells by Western blot. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P
  < 0.01 vs. blank group.
