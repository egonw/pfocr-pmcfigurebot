caption: Regulatory mechanism of internode elongation based on combined analysis of
  metabolome and transcriptome. (A) Integrative KEGG pathway of DEGs and SDMs. The
  x-axis represents the metabolic pathway. The y-axis represents −log (p-value) of
  DEGs indicated by red color bars and SDMs indicated by green color bars. ‘Plant
  hormone signal transduction’ is indicated by a blue dotted box. (B) Auxin signal
  transduction pathway including DEGs and SDMs. pme1651, annotated as IAA, was the
  unique auxin-related SDM detected in OE vs. WT comparison group. A total of nine
  DEGs interacted with pme1651. After a series of analyses, three DEGs including gene-LOC107793623,
  gene-LOC107777931 and gene-LOC107818257 were identified, which played a key role
  in the regulation of internode length. (C) The RT-qPCR validation of three genes
  including gene-LOC107777931, gene-LOC107793623 and gene-LOC107818257. Values are
  presented as mean ± SD for three biological replicates. Statistical significance
  was presented as ** p < 0.01, * p < 0.05. The solid red line represents the expression
  trend of three genes from transcriptome data. (D) A simple model of AaMYBC1 induced
  internode elongation by mediating the expression of auxin-related genes, and regulation
  of vine architecture.
