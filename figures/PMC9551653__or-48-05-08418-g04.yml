caption: 'Inhibition of the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway eliminates the effect of MYCL
  on triple-negative breast cancer cells. Expression levels of (A) JAK/STAT3 pathway-related
  proteins and (B) STAT3 downstream genes in MDA-MB-231 cells were assessed through
  western blotting. (C and G) MDA-MB-231 cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry.
  (D and H) MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation was estimated by colony formation assay
  (scale bar, 500 µm). (E and I) MDA-MB-231 cell migration was assessed by wound healing
  assay (scale bar, 100 µm). (F and J) Transwell assay was used to detect MDA-MB-231
  cell invasion (scale bar=200 µm). *P<0.05 vs. pc-group; #P<0.05 vs. pc-MYCL. NC,
  negative control; p, phosphorylated; Ruxo, ruxolitinib; MYCL, MYCL proto-oncogene.'
