caption: Hepatic transcriptome sequencing profiles and pathway enrichments in ABX
  mice under NLD and SD. NLD, the antibiotic-treated mice managed under normal light–dark
  cycle; SD, the antibiotic-treated mice managed under short-day cycle. The differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) were screened out by setting p < 0.05 and |log 2 Fold Change|
  > 1 as threshold. (A) The heatmap of the differentially expressed genes; (B) the
  volcano plot of the differentially expressed genes, red dots represent up-regulated
  and blue dots represent down-regulated; (C) GSEA plots for the enrichments of pathways
  in cancer, MAPK signaling pathway, and purine metabolism; (D) Gene Ontology (GO)
  functional analysis of the significantly expressed genes; (E) KEGG functional analysis
  of the significantly expressed genes.
