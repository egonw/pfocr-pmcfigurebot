caption: Glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway and differentially expressed genes.
  (A) The basic phospholipid biosynthetic pathway with heatmap showing gene expression
  levels. The left block of each gene indicated the log2(fold change) under OPDA treatment
  obtained from transcriptome sequencing analysis. (B) qPCR analysis confirmed that
  several genes involved in phospholipid biosynthesis were markedly upregulated under
  OPDA treatment. CHO1, CDP-diacylglycerol-serine O-phosphatidyltransferase; PISD,
  phosphatidylserine decarboxylase; PLA2G, secretory phospholipase A2; PEMT, phosphatidylethanolamine/phosphatidyl-N-methylethanolamine
  N-methyltransferase; GDE1, glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase; PCYT1, choline-phosphate
  cytidylyltransferase; CPT1, diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase. Significant
  difference (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, ns, no significant).
