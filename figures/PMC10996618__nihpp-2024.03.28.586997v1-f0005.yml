figure_title: The mutant GR protects muscle from insulin resistance and lipid accumulation
  with high-fat diet
caption: (A) Mutant male mice resisted weight gain significantly after a 12-week-long
  high-fat diet exposure, exhibiting a remarkable decrease in macroscopic fat accumulation
  in hindlimb muscles and significant improvements in lean and muscle masses. (B)
  Mutant obese mice showed improved exercise tolerance and force compared to obese
  controls. (C) Glucose homeostasis and muscle 2DG uptake was improved in mutant mice.
  (D) WB analysis of whole and phosphorylated proteins showed increased activation
  of Foxc1 and its targets in the insulin response pathway in mutant obese muscle
  compared to control obese muscle. (E) Arid5a was increased and its transactivation
  targets decreased in the mutant obese muscle. (F) Combination of in vivo muscle
  overexpression of both Foxc1 and Arid5a recapitulated the SNP effect on parameters
  of muscle insulin resistance and triacylglycerol accumulation, partially protecting
  the transduced mice from the adverse effects of high-fat diet. N=3–4/group; Welch’s
  t-test (histograms), 2w ANOVA + Sidak (curves); *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.001;
  ****, P<0.0001.
