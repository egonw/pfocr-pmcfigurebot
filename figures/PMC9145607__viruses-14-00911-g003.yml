caption: GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the total DEGs in chicken embryonic
  visceral tissues infected with viruses. (A,B) GO enrichment analysis of total DEGs
  identified in the groups between NAâˆ’1 and LaSota at 24 hpi (A) and 36 hpi (B). The
  top ten DEGs, according to mean difference (absolute log2FC (fold change)), are
  presented and sorted by decreasing mean value (p < 0.05). (C,D) KEGG pathway enrichment
  analysis of total DEGs identified in the groups between NA-1 and LaSota at 24 hpi
  (C) and 36 hpi (D). The dot size indicates the number of DEGs. The redder the color,
  the smaller the p-value (p < 0.05).
