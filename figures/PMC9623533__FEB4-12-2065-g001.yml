caption: 'Excessive level of ER stress combined with inactivation of GADD34 affects
  PERK pathway on the mRNA level. (A) The relative cell number and (B) the relative
  caspase 3/7 activity were followed in the case of high level of ER stress (10 μm
  thapsigargin for 2 h) combined without (light gray column) or with (dark gray column)
  GADD34 inactivation via guanabenz treatment (50 μm for 1 h) in HEK293T. (C) GADD34
  inactivation was inhibited by guanabenz treatment (50 μm for 1 h) followed by the
  addition of a high level of ER stress (10 μm thapsigargin for 2 h), then the cells
  were denoted in time. The mRNA level of key markers of PERK pathway (i.e. ATF4,
  CHOP, and GADD34) was depicted by real‐time PCR. Control samples were not treated
  with any reagent (including DMSO). For each of the experiments, three complete biological
  repeat experiments were carried out. Error bars represent standard deviation. In
  the calculation of statistical significance, data from guanabenz pretreated samples
  were compared to the not pretreated samples with the corresponding treatment time
  of 10 μm TG. Results are presented as mean values ± SD and were compared using ANOVA
  with Tukey''s multiple comparison post hoc test. Asterisks indicate statistically
  significant difference from the appropriate control: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01. GB,
  guanabenz; TG, thapsigargin.'
