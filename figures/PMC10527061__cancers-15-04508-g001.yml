caption: 'ZFP64 is highly expressed in GBC patients and the higher expression of ZFP64
  is associated with poor prognosis. (A) The mRNA level of ZFP64 in gallbladder carcinoma
  tissues and in paired adjacent normal tissues from 50 GBC patients. (B) The mRNA
  level of ZFP64 in metastatic (n = 24) and non-metastatic (n = 26) gallbladder carcinoma
  tissues. (C) The ratio of ZFP64 mRNA level in gallbladder carcinoma tissues and
  in paired adjacent normal tissues. Each color represented an individual patient.
  (D) Western blot assays were performed to detect the expression level of ZFP64 in
  gallbladder carcinoma tissues and in adjacent normal tissues from 10 GBC patients.
  (N: Normal gallbladder tissues; C: gallbladder carcinoma tissues). (E) The relationship
  between the overall survival (OS) with the expression level of ZFP64 (n = 50). (F)
  Prognostic indicators for OS in multivariate analysis (G) The relationship between
  the recurrence-free survival (RFS) with the expression level of ZFP64 (n = 50).
  (H) Prognostic indicators for RFS in multivariate analysis. Each color in F/1H represented
  different clinical pathological features as Y-axis shows. All data were assessed
  using unpaired Student’s t test or Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, as mean ± SD,
  * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001. See  for original western blots.'
