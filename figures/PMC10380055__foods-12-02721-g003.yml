caption: Characteristics of structures and sequences from the enzymes in the bacterial
  degradation pathway of caffeine. (A) Sequence arrangement of N-demethylase-related
  genes in the genome of Pseudomonas sp. NCIM 5235 []. Arrows suggest the position
  and orientation of each orf. Green arrows suggest the genes directly involved in
  caffeine metabolism, and yellow arrows indicate genes involved in the metabolism
  of by-products and other unknown functions. (B) Sequence arrangement of genes involved
  in the C-8 pathway in the genome of Pseudomonas sp. CBB1 []. Arrows suggest the
  position and orientation of each orf. Genes required for caffeine oxidation are
  represented by blue arrows, while those required for trimethyluric acid oxidation
  are represented by red arrows.
