caption: Canonical signaling pathways demonstrate distinct regulation patterns in
  females and males. Canonical pathways were predicted in IPA and ranked by z-scores.
  Positive (red) and negative (green) z-scores indicate pathway up-regulation or down-regulation,
  respectively, according to the color scale. Asterisks indicate significance *, z
  < –2.0 or z > 2.0; **, z < –3.0, or z > 3.0. The gray color indicates that the directionality
  of pathway regulation was not determined. Purple (females) and blue (males) horizontal
  bars correspond to –log10(P) ≥ 1.3 calculated in IPA using Fisher exact test.
