caption: The positive regulatory effect of MT was significantly weakened with the
  use of PI3K inhibitors. (a–d) Western blot results for the expressions of PI3K-p85,
  p-AKT, AKT, p-mTOR, and mTOR were pretreated with GDC-0941 and MT for 24 h; DEX
  (10−3 M) was then added for 24 h. (e) Images of immunofluorescence staining of PI3K
  in BMSCs. (f) Quantification of the fluorescence intensity of PI3K immunofluorescence
  positively stained cells. (g) Annexin V-mCherry/SYTOX Green detection kit was used
  to detect cell death. (h) Quantitative analysis of the percentage of SYTOX green-positive
  cells in (g). (i) ROS staining was performed to test the level of oxidative stress
  in DEX + MT group and DEX + MT + GDC0941 group. (j) Quantitative analysis of the
  number of ROS-positive cells per field in (i). These studies were performed at least
  3 biological replicates. Data represent mean ± SD (n = 3). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗P < 0.005 compared with DEX + MT group.
