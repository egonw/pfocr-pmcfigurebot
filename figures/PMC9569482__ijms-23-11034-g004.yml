caption: The CWI pathway is essential for yeast cells to survive in the presence of
  neomycin. (a) Scheme depicting the main components of the CWI pathway. (b) Sensitivity
  to neomycin of isogenic Y3656 mutants lacking the indicated CWI pathway components
  was assayed by spotting 10-fold serial dilutions of cell suspensions onto YPD plates
  in the absence (no stress) or presence of either 2 or 5 mg/mL neomycin or 10 μg/mL
  of CR. Red letters indicate higher sensitivity to neomycin than the wild-type strain.
  A representative assay from three different experiments is shown. (c) Neomycin-elicited
  signaling to Slt2 is mediated by core components of the CWI pathway. Western blotting
  analysis of extracts of isogenic Y3656 mutants lacking the indicated CWI pathway
  components treated (+) or not (−) for 4 h with 10 mg/mL neomycin. (d) Western blotting
  analysis of CML128 (WT) and pkc1Δ mutant isogenic strains in the absence (−) or
  presence of 30 μg/mL CR or 10 mg/mL neomycin (N) for 4 h. Dually phosphorylated
  Slt2 and G6PDH (as a loading control) were detected with anti-phospho-p44/42 and
  anti-G6PDH antibodies, respectively. A representative blot from three independent
  experiments is displayed. (e) Neomycin induces Rlm1-mediated gene transcription.
  Transcriptional induction analysis of the MLP1 gene by RT-qPCR in response to neomycin
  compared to CR in the Y3656 strain. Cells were cultured in the absence of stress
  (−) or with 10 mg/mL neomycin or 30 μg/mL CR for 1 or 4 h. The graph shows the mean
  and standard deviation of the expression level from three independent experiments.
  Asterisks indicate statistical significance relative to the absence of stress according
  to a Student’s t-test (* = p-value < 0.05; ** = p-value < 0.01; *** = p-value <
  0.001).
