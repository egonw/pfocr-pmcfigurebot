caption: 'AS-IV attenuated renal lipid peroxidation in the I/R-induced CKD model.
  (A) MDA levels as detected using assay kits. (B) SOD activity as detected using
  assay kits. #P<0.05, ##P<0.01 compared to the sham operation group; *P<0.05, **P<0.01

  IV; I/R, ischemia-reperfusion; CKD, chronic kidney disease.'
