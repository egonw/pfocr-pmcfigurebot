figure_title: TREM2 regulates the arginase 1+ microglial phenotype and is associated
  with the BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway
caption: A–C Western blot assay showing BDNF, PSD-95, and the ratio of p-TrkB/TrkB
  expression in the mPFC. The data are presented as the means ± SEMs (n = 5 or 6).
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001 (one-way ANOVA). D Representative photomicrographs
  and quantification of the dendritic spine density in the mPFC. Scale bar = 10 μm.
  The data are presented as the means ± SEMs (n = 5). *P < 0.05 and ***P < 0.001 (one-way
  ANOVA). E The working model for Nrf2-induced TREM2 transcription in the model of
  depression. Activation of Nrf2 by SFN induces an arginase 1+ microglial phenotype
  by initiating TREM2 transcription and thus ameliorates depression-like behavior
  in mice.
