caption: qPCR validation of genes involved in anthocyanin synthesis. The expression
  profiles of 9 genes were measured by RNA-seq and qRT PCR. These nine genes include
  structural genes and transcription factors related to the flavonoid pathway. The
  histogram data represent qRT PCR data (left y-axis) and the broken line represents
  RNA-seq data (right y-axis). Blue dots in the histogram represent light treatment
  and orange dots represent dark treatment. The x-axis in each chart represents three-light
  treatment stages (48 h, 72 h, and 168 h). The qRT PCR assay had three biological
  replicates, each with three technical replicates (n = 9). The FPKM value of RNA-seq
  has three biological repetitions (n = 3). The error bars indicate the standard deviation.
