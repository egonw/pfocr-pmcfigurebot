caption: 'Schematic overview of the bidirectional communication pathways between the
  gut-microbiota and the brain (Microbiome–Gut–Brain Axis (MGBA)). The colon is inhabited
  by many different bacteria strains, which directly or indirectly interact with the
  nerve cells and the brain. The direct pathway includes cytokine signalling after
  recognition of bacteria through immune cells. Cytokines may also stimulate the body’s
  stress response via upregulating the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA-axis).
  Indirectly, the bacteria can communicate with their metabolites: utilising dietary
  fibres, they produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are important for epithelium
  cells and enter the systemic blood circulation. Certain strains of bacteria can
  produce amino acids or neuroactive metabolites, such as neurotransmitters, which
  gain access to the brain through blood circulation. Furthermore, bacteria can stimulate
  enteroendocrine cells, which themselves release hormones into the bloodstream. The
  bacterial metabolites can also send afferent signals to the brain through enteric
  nerve cells belonging to the ENS and the vagus nerve. On the other hand, the brain
  influences important aspects (e.g., motility and mucus secretion) of gut physiology
  through efferent signals travelling along the vagus nerve and ENS cells. The arrows
  show the direction of the individual communication pathways and the different signalling
  stations involved.'
