caption: DXM induces TTP expression without induction of FOXO1 expression. (A) Validation
  of the DEGs in the FOXO signaling pathway in KEGG analysis by qRT-PCR analysis.
  MDA-MB-231 cells were stimulated with 500 nM DXM for 3 h. The mRNA expression levels
  of CDKN1A, BCL6, GADD45A, S1PR1, IRS2, and SGK1 were analyzed by qRT-PCR. Fold change
  in expression level was calculated relative to that of the DMSO control. The graphs
  are mean ± SD of three independent experiments (Student’s t test, * p < 0.05; **
  p < 0.005; *** p < 0.001). (B) Effect of DXM on the expression of the FOXO1 in MDA-MB-231
  cells. MDA-MB-231 cells were stimulated with 500 nM DXM for 3 h. The expression
  level of FOXO1 was analyzed by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. In addition, phosphorylation
  of GR was determined by western blot. Fold change in expression level was calculated
  relative to that of the DMSO control. The graphs are mean ± SD of three independent
  experiments (Student’s t test). (C) Effect of ectopic expression of FOXO1 on the
  DXM-induced expression of TTP in MDA-MB-231 cells. MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected
  with pFOXO1 plasmid. After 24 h incubation, cells were stimulated with 500 nM DXM
  in the presence or absence of mifepristone for 3 h. Expression of FOXO1 and phosphorylation
  of GR were determined by western blot analysis. The expression level of TTP mRNA
  was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Fold change in expression level was calculated relative
  to that of the DMSO control. The graphs are mean ± SD of three independent experiments
  (Student’s t test and one-way ANOVA, *** p < 0.001). ns, not significant.
