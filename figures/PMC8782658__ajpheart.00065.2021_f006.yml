caption: 'PKCζ regulates leukocyte adhesion. Confluent monolayers of EAhy926 cells
  were preincubated with 1 µM inhibitor peptide for 20 min before TNF-α treatment
  for 5 and 15 min. Then, isolated human preactivated PMNs were added to the monolayers
  and allowed to adhere for 30 min at 37°C. Nonadherent PMNs were washed away and
  MPO activity was assayed in the cell lysates. Two-way ANOVA and Holm–Sidak test,
  *P < 0.05 in comparison to time 0, #P < 0.05 in comparison to the treatment with
  TNF-α; n = 3 independent experiments. Data were normalized at adhesion seen at time
  0. MPO, myeloperoxidase; PKCζ, protein kinase Cζ; PMN, polymorphonuclear leukocyte;
  TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α.'
