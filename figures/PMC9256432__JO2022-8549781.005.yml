caption: Inhibition of p38 phosphorylation reversed PAX6 upregulation caused by TNFRSF9
  knockdown. (a, c) qRT-PCR assays for TNFRSF9 mRNA expression (left panel) and PAX6
  mRNA expression (right panel) in MGF-7 cells (a) or ZR-75-30 cells (c) transfected
  with si-TNFRSF9 and with or without p38 MAPK-IN-1. (b, d) Western blot assays for
  TNFRSF9, p-P38, P38, and PAX6 protein expression (left panel) and quantification
  of protein expression (right panel) in MGF-7 cells (b) or ZR-75-30 cells (d) transfected
  with si-TNFRSF9 and with or without p38 MAPK-IN-1. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p
  < 0.001.
