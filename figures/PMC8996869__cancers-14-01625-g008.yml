caption: High miR-199a-5p and low let-7a-5p expression correlate with increased TGFβ1
  and TGFβ-R1 expression. (A) Data showing the mean TGFβ-R1 and TGFβ1 expression from
  the TCGA study based on the median miR-199a-5p expression. (B,C) Comparison based
  on the median miR-199a-5p expression of 102 patients out of the 113 total patients
  (11 were excluded; 7 with unknown Gleason score, 2 outliers and 2 with unknown TGFβ-R1
  and TGFβ1 expression), showing a correlation between higher miR-199a-5p expression
  and higher TGFβ-R1 expression associated with a positive trend towards increased
  TGFβ1 (Log2 normalized) expression. (D) Data showing the mean TGFβ-R1 and TGFβ1
  expressions from the TCGA study based on the median let-7a-5p expression. (E,F)
  A comparison between high and low let-7a-5p expression based on the median value
  for 102 patients showed lower let-7a-5p expression significantly associated with
  lower TGFβ-R1 expression and a positive trend towards increased TGFβ1 expression.
  * (p < 0.05). Data are presented as the mean ± SD.
