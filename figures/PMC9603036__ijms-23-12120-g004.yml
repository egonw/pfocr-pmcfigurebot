caption: Expression patterns of the DEGs involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis at three
  developmental stages. (A) Schematic diagram of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway.
  DEGs are highlighted by underlines. (B) Heat maps of DEGs involved in anthocyanin
  biosynthesis at three developmental stages. Gene-expression level was measured using
  the TPM method. Horizontal axes represent three developmental stages, including
  initial stage (AaF_I_1 and AaF_I_2), middle stage (AaF_M_1 and AaF_M_2), last stage
  (AaF_L_1 and AaF_L_2), and vertical axes represent gene ID. Heat map shows the expression
  of genes ranging from blue (low expression) to red (high expression).
