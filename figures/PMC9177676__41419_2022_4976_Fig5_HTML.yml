figure_title: miR-199a-3p enhances chemosensitivity and stemness in ovarian cancer
  cells
caption: 'A Dose–response curve of A2780 Parental vs. A2780/DDP cells (left), and
  HEYA8 HM vs. HEYA8 NM cells (right) against cisplatin. B Dose–response curve of
  miR-199a-3p-overexpressing A2780/DDP cells (left) against cisplatin and C against
  cisplatin/paclitaxel for SKOV-3 cells (right). The miR-199a-3p-overexpressing SKOV-3
  cells were divided into two groups: cisplatin and paclitaxel treatment. D Expression
  of miR-199a-3p in chemosensitive vs. chemoresistant patient tumors and Kaplan–Meier
  Survival analysis for patient stratified by miR-199a-3p expression, and clinicopathological
  table of patients. Bar graph values are mean ± SD, n = 3. T-test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.005.
  Statistical analysis for patient samples is mentioned in clinicopathological table.'
