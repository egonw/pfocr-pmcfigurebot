figure_title: Innate immune response and autophagy flux in MERS-CoV-MA-WT and MERS-CoV-MA-Δ4b
  infected MRC-5 cells after the autophagy pathway was chemically inhibited
caption: 'mRNA expression levels of genes related to autophagy pathway and pro-inflammatory
  response were quantified by RT-qPCR in MRC-5 cells either mock-infected or infected
  with MERS-CoV-MA-WT or MERS-CoV-MA-Δ4b at a m.o.i of 1 for 24 h p.i after the treatment
  (+ 3-MA) or not (- 3-MA) with 5mM 3-methyladenine for 16 h. Bars represent means
  and error bars represent standard deviations (n = 3). Mock, Mock-infected cells.
  Differences were analyzed by Student’s t test: *, p-value < 0.05; **, p-value <
  0.01; ***, p-value < 0.001. Asterisks on the columns represent significant differences
  between mock-treated and cells.'
article_title: MERS-CoV ORF4b is a virulence factor involved in the inflammatory pathology
  induced in the lungs of mice.
