caption: SDC3 siRNA#1 depletion in (A) SKOV3 and (B) CAOV3 cells results in reduced
  activation of Stat3. SKOV3 and CAOV3 cells were subjected to control or SDC3 siRNA#1
  treatment, serum starved for 24 h and stimulated with 2 ng/mL of the cytokine Midkine
  (MDK) for the indicated timepoints. Cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting
  for the active, phosphorylated form of Stat3, total Stat3 and Gapdh as a loading
  control. SDC3 depletion reduces the constitutive activation of Stat3 in both cell
  lines. Representative blot from 3 experiments. Total Stat3 and Gapdh were detected
  on the same membrane after antibody stripping. (C) String analysis reveals direct
  functional interactions of SDC3 with SDC1 and Notch1 and indirect interactions with
  constituents of the stemness-associated Notch, Wnt and hedgehog pathways. Interaction
  analysis of SDC3 with SDC1, STAT3, the Notch pathway constituents NOTCH1 and HES1,
  the Wnt signaling constituents WNT5A and TCF7L1, the hedgehog pathway constituents
  GLI1â€“3, and the EMT-related markers E-cadherin (CDH1) and Snail (SNAI1) was performed
  using the STRING database (http://string-db.org/, accessed on 4 June 2021).
