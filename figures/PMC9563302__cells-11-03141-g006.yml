caption: α1,3-mannosylated uPAR binding with ADAM8 stimulates ovarian metastasis by
  activating the Ras/ERK signaling pathway. (A,B) Western blot analysis of ADAM8 expression
  after ALG3 cDNA with uPAR cDNA or uPAR MUT cDNA co-transfection and antibody blockade
  of ADAM8 in A2780 (A) and SKOV3 (B) cells. (C,D) Western blot analysis of Ras, p-ERK
  and ERK expression, as well as EMT markers (E-cadherin, N-cadherin and Vimentin)
  expression. (E) The migration and invasion potential detected by transwell migration/Matrigel
  invasion assay. (F) Representative images of fluorescently labeled A2780 and SKOV3
  cells adhering to HPMCs. Bars represent 5 μm (F) and 10 μm (E).
