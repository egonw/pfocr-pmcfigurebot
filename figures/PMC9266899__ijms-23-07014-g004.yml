caption: Network propagation highlights important liver clustering pathways and biological
  networks in the absence of TRPV1 channels. Network propagation of the TRPV1 channel
  in the liver of WT (A) and Trpv1 KO mice (B). TRPV1 protein input under each network
  served as a driver for network propagation in Trpv1 KO and WT. Separately propagated
  subnetworks with 141 proteins found to be significant in the propagation were clustered
  into smaller subnetworks and annotated using integrated enrichment analysis (GO-BP
  and KEGG pathway) to identify functional networks that are different between two
  propagated subnetworks (EnrichmentMap FDR < 0.01). Node names represent the proteins
  exclusively found in each propagated subnetwork; black for proteins shared between
  Trpv1 KO and WT proteomes; blue for proteins only found or upregulated in the WT
  proteome; red for proteins only found or upregulated in the Trpv1 KO proteome. Cluster
  title indicates the top five most significant biological function(s) for each cluster,
  and (#) refers to the KEGG pathway/GO-BP annotations exclusively enriched in each
  propagated subnetwork. (C) Framework of propagated network integration for enriched
  glucagon signaling pathway from KEGG in the WT proteome. (D) Framework shows proposed
  modulation of FBP-2 by PKA and AMPK kinases in Trpv1 KO mice resulting in more active
  gluconeogenesis than in WT mice. Blue nodes for proteins only found in the WT proteome,
  dual colors (blue/red) for proteins shared among proteomes, and black for proteins
  not found in the proteomic data. (+p) refers to phosphorylation and (−p) to dephosphorylation.
