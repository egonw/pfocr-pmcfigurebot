caption: The role of lipid metabolism reprogramming in cancer cell death. (A) Increased
  exogenous lipid uptake by CD36 and LDLR promote carcinogenesis. (B) A network regulates
  the four systems and the entire transportation process. The elevated expression
  of ABCA1, HDL/ApoA-1, SR-B1 and CAV-1 accelerate cholesterol efflux, which lead
  to cancer cell apoptosis. (C) The increment of cholesterol esterification regulated
  by ACAT1 induces apoptosis. (D) Glucose increases N-glycosylation of SCAP, activates
  SREBPs, ultimately inhibits apoptosis of cancer cells. The biosynthesis pathway
  converts acetyl-CoA into cholesterol through HMGCs and HMGCR, which are the key
  speed-limiting enzymes. (E) The upregulation of enzymes promotes fatty acid synthesis
  and oxidation, then induces ferroptosis. (F) PLA2 and LPCAT2 induce LDs formation,
  stimulates cancer cell survival, and prevents apoptosis.
