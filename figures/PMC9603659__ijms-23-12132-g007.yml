caption: SCAP promotes GCs steroidogenesis and proliferation. (A,B) CCK-8 assay was
  performed to assess the effect of SCAP overexpression and knockdown on GCs proliferation.
  (C) BrdU analysis was performed to assess the effect of SCAP overexpression and
  knockdown on GCs proliferation; scale bars are 100 µm. (D,E) Detection of E2 concentrations
  in GCs transfected with pcDNA3.1-SCAP and pcDNA3.1 empty plasmids, i.e., si-SCAP
  and si-NC. (F,G) Detection of P4 concentrations in GCs transfected with pcDNA3.1-SCAP
  and pcDNA3.1 empty plasmids, i.e., si-SCAP and si-NC. (H,I) RT-qPCR was used to
  examine the effect of overexpression and knockdown of SCAP on the expression levels
  of steroidogenesis-related (CYP11A1, CYP19A1, and 3β-HSD) and sterol regulation-related
  (SCAP and SREBP) mRNAs in GCs. (J) Overexpression and knockdown of SCAP affected
  the expression of steroidogenesis-related proteins and sterol regulatory element
  proteins. Values represent means ± SEM for three individuals. * p < 0.05; ** p <
  0.01; *** p < 0.001. N.S., not significant.
