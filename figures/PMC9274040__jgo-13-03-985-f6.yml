caption: 'Interfering with the expression of DDIT4 in GC cells reversed the effects
  of the miR-383-5p inhibitor on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis.
  (A,B) The level of DDIT4 protein was measured by Western blot; (C) cell proliferation
  activity was measured by the CCK-8 method; (D) cell migration ability was measured
  by the scratch test. The cell migration width was observed under an inverted microscope
  with the original magnification of 50 times; (E) the invasion ability of cells was
  detected by transwell. The number of transmembrane cells stained with crystal violet
  was observed under an inverted microscope, and the original magnification was 100
  times; (F) apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. Compared to the control or
  si-NC or NC inhibitor group, *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001; compared to the miR-383-5p
  inhibitor group, ###P<0.001. RS, resveratrol; NC, normal control; GC, gastric cancer;
  DDIT4, DNA damage-inducible transcript 4; CCK-8, Cell Counting Kit 8.'

  induces the apoptosis of human gastric cancer cells through the MALAT1/miR-383-5p/DDIT4
  signaling pathway.
