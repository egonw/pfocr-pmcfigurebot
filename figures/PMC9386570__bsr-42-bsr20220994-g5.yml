figure_title: MLN4924 activated the p53 signaling pathway in AML cells
caption: (A,B) In THP-1 and MOLM-13 cells, the expression levels of p21 and p53 proteins
  were significantly up-regulated after MLN4924 treatment. (C) In primary AML cells
  harvested from two AML patients, MLN4924 increased the expression of both p21 and
  p53 proteins. (D,E) Statistical analysis indicated that the expression of p21 and
  p53 was up-regulated; ***P<0.001, **P<0.01. An independent sample t-test was conducted
  to compare the means between two groups. Each experiment was carried out in triplicate.
