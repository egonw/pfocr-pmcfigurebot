caption: Ahnak knockout (KO) mice show increased mitosis in the liver after PH. (A)
  Liver to body weight ratios at the indicated time points after PH in WT and Ahnak
  KO mice (n = 3, each). (B) Quantification of hepatocyte nuclei undergoing mitosis
  at the indicated time points after PH (n = 3). (C) Representative hematoxylin-eosin
  staining images and nuclei during mitosis (yellow arrow) in the liver at the indicated
  time points after PH. (D) Graphical summary of Ahnak expression in liver regeneration
  after PH. *P < 0.05; Error bars represent the mean ± SD; Scale bar = 10 μm.
