caption: 'Biosynthesis of terpenoids and expression of related DEGs across four levels
  of P. frutescens leaves. Highly expressed genes are indicated in purple, whereas
  lowly expressed genes are in green. From left to right, the four levels were L4,
  L6, L8, and L9. Genes in blue are involved in the MEP and monoterpenoid biosynthesis
  pathways, and genes in black are involved in the MVA pathway. Dashed arrows in the
  yellow boxes indicate unknown biosynthetic pathways of perilla ketone. Abbreviations:
  DOXP, 1-Deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate; MEP, 2-C-Methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate;
  CDP-ME, 4-(Cytidine 5’-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol; CDP-MEP, 2-Phospho-4-(cytidine
  5’-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol; MECP, 2-C-Methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate;
  HMBPP, 1-Hydroxy-2-methyl-2-butenyl 4-diphosphate; IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate;
  DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; AACT, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase; HMGS, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA;
  HMGCR, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase synthase; MVK, mevalonate kinase; PMK,
  phosphomevalonate kinase; MVD, mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase; MVA, Mevalonic
  acid; MVA-5-P, Mevalonic acid 5-phosphate; MVAPP, 5-Diphosphomevalonic acid; FPP,
  Farnesyl diphosphate. The biosynthesis was redrawn based on map 00900 and 00902
