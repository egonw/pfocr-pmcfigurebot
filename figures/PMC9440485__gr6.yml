caption: 'iMSC-lEVs modulated macrophage polarization via mediating the p38 MAPK signaling
  pathway. (a–b) Western blot analysis of p-p38 and p38 expression in RAW 264.7 cells
  under different treatments (n = 3/group). (c) RT-qPCR analysis of pro-inflammatory
  genes and anti-inflammatory genes expression in RAW 264.7 cells under different
  treatments (n = 3/group). (d–e) Flow cytometry analysis and quantification of CD86+
  macrophage percentage and CD206+ macrophage percentage under different treatments
  (n = 3/group). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, #P < 0.0001, ns, nonsignificant
  difference.'
