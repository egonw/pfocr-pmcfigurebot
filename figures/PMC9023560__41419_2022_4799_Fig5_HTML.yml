  of mTOR inhibit PNI of pancreatic cancer
caption: A, B Cancer cell-DRG coculture model for the NC and sh mTOR groups in PANC-1
  and BxPC-3 cells; C, D Western blot analysis of the expression of mTOR, N-cadherin,
  E-cadherin, Vimentin, and NGF in the wild-type, NC, sh mTOR-1, and sh mTOR-2 groups
  in PANC-1 cells and BxPC-3 cells. E, F Wound healing assay of the NC and sh mTOR
  groups in PANC-1 cells and BxPC-3 cells. G, H Transwell-based assay of the NC and
  sh mTOR groups in PANC-1 cells and BxPC-3 cells. I, J Cancer cell-DRG coculture
  model for the NC, HGF, sh mTOR, and sh mTOR+HGF groups in PANC-1 cells and BxPC-3
  cells. K, L Western blot analysis of the expression of mTOR, N-cadherin, E-cadherin,
  Vimentin, and NGF in the NC, HGF, sh mTOR, and sh mTOR+HGF groups in PANC-1 cells
  and BxPC-3 cells. M, N Wound healing assay of the NC, HGF, sh mTOR, and sh mTOR+HGF
  groups in PANC-1 cells and BxPC-3 cells. O, P Transwell-based assay of the NC, HGF,
