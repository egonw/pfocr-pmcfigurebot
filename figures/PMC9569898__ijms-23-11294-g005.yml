caption: KLB promotes the fibrosis and proliferation of HESCs through the PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathway. (A) Through Western blot analysis, it was found that under the
  same stimulation with TGF-β1, the expression of P-AKT in the KLB overexpression
  group was significantly higher than in the control group transfected with the empty
  plasmid. (B) Through Western blot analysis, it was found that LY294002, an inhibitor
  of PI3K, could rescue the protein levels of Collagen I and FN after KLB overexpression.
  (C) The cell proliferation ability was detected by the CCK8 assay, and it was found
  that LY294002 could also reduce the cell proliferation promoted by KLB overexpression.
  (D) The activation the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by KLB plays a critical role in
  IUA by regulating ESC proliferation and fibrosis. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01.
