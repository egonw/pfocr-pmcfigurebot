caption: Metabolic regulations of exhausted T cells in the TME. Exhausted T cells
  exhibit metabolic insufficiency with inhibited glycolysis, mitochondrial respiration
  and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function. Enhanced PD-1 signaling in Tex cells dampens
  the transcriptional coactivator PGC1α, decreasing glycolysis but promoting fatty
  acid oxidation (FAO). The overloaded cholesterol elicits more ER stress via the
  XBP1 cascades and fosters the expression of inhibitory receptors. Moreover, impaired
  glycolysis activates the IRE1-XBP1 signaling pathway, resulting in elevated ER stress
  and dysregulations of mitochondrial function. The dysfunctional mitochondria produce
  robust ROS, ultimately promoting TOX expression and repressing effector functions
  in Tex cells. Created with BioRender.com.
