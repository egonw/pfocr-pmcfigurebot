caption: 'ifc regulates CNS and glial morphology. A) Ventral views of late-third instar
  larvae of indicated genotype showing 3xP3 RFP labeling of CNS and nerves. Arrowheads
  indicate nerve bulges; scale bar is 200μm. B-B’) Schematic of Ifc (B) and human
  DEGS1 (B’) proteins indicating location and nature of ifc mutations and 15 HLD-18-causing
  DEGS1 mutations.,, C) Schematic of de novo ceramide biosynthesis pathway indicating
  the subcellular location of ceramide synthesis and ceramide modifications. D) Chemical
  structure of dihydroceramide and ceramide; arrow indicates trans carbon-carbon double
  bond between C4 and C5 in the sphingoid backbone created by the enzymatic action
  of Ifc/DEGS1. E) Normalized quantification of the relative levels of dihydroceramide,
  ceramide, and six related sphingolipid species in the dissected CNS of wild-type
  and ifc−/− late-third instar larvae. F) Ventral views of Drosophila CNS and peripheral
  nerves in wild-type and ifc−/− mutant late-third instar larvae labeled for NCAD
  to mark the neuropil, HRP to label axons, RFP to label glia, Dpn to label neuroblasts,
  ELAV to label neurons, and FABP to label cortex glia. Anterior is up; scale bar
  is 100μm for whole CNS images and 20μm for peripheral nerve image. Statistics: *
  denotes p < 0.05, ** denotes p < 0.01, *** denotes p < 0.001, **** denotes p < 0.0001.'
