caption: Top 20 enriched KEGG pathways of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in
  R-HJH compared with HJH. The X-axis shows the rich factor. A high q-value is represented
  by blue, and a low q-value is represented by red (p value < 0.05). The Y-axis represents
  the second KEGG pathway terms. The number of DEGs is represented by the size of
  the circle.
