caption: 'Transforming growth factor-beta 1 signaling pathway. Smad and non-Smad pathways
  mainly regulate transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) signal transduction.
  Integrin signaling triggers the activation and release of TGF-β1 from LCC (large
  latent complex). Activated TGF-β1 binds TGF-β type II receptor, leading to phosphorylation
  of TGF-β type I receptor and associated Smad proteins, mainly Smad-2 and Smad-3.
  Phosphorylated Smad-2 and 3, complex with the co-Smad, Smad-7, form a ternary complex.
  This ternary complex then translocates into the nucleus, binds to Smad binding elements
  and regulates the transcription of TGF-β-related genes. TGF: Transforming growth
  factor; LAP: Latency associated protein; LTAB: Latent transforming growth factor-beta
  binding protein; SBE: Smad binding elements; ECM: Extracellular matrix; mTOR: Mammalian
  target of Rapamycin; PI3K: Phosphoinositide 3-kinase; AKT: AKT serine/threonine
  kinase 1; MKK: Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; JNK: C-Jun N-terminal kinase.'
