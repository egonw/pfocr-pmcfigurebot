caption: MYCL silencing inhibits triple-negative breast cancer tumor growth. (A) Tumors
  excised from sh-MYCL and sh-NC mice groups. (B) Changes in tumor volume. (C) Tumor
  weight. (D) Protein expression levels of MYCL in tumor tissue. Expression levels
  of (E) JAK/STAT3 pathway-related proteins and (F) STAT3 downstream proteins in tumor
  tissues were assessed by western blotting. *P<0.05 vs. sh-NC. NC, negative control;
  p, phosphorylated; sh, short hairpin; MYCL, MYCL proto-oncogene.
