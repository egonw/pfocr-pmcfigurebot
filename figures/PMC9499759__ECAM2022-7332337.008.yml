caption: The roles of si-hsa_circ_0000847 and miR-135a on cell apoptosis. (a) Flow
  cytometry was used to detect cell apoptosis in HepG2.2.15 cells. (b) The expression
  levels of apoptosis-related proteins Bcl-2, Bad, and cleaved caspase-3 in HepG2.2.15
  cells. (c) Flow cytometry was used to detect cell apoptosis in HepG2+pHBV1.3 cells.
  (d) The expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins Bcl-2, Bad, and cleaved
  caspase-3 in HepG2 + pHBV1.3 cells. n = 3, mean ± SD, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p
  < 0.001 vs control.
