caption: Effect of medicarpin pretreatment on the expression of salicylic acid (SA)
  and jasmonic acid (JA) pathway genes and select isoflavonoid biosynthetic genes
  in R108. Relative expression of (a) SA biosynthesis and signalling markers, (b)
  JA biosynthesis and signalling markers, and (c) IFS1 and IFR 3 h (preinoculation)
  and 48 h postinoculation (hpi) (post‐powdery mildew [PM] inoculation) in medicarpin‐
  and mock‐treated R108 leaves. (d) Relative expression of SA biosynthesis and signalling
  markers (left), JA biosynthesis and signalling markers (middle), and IFS1 and IFR
  (right) in 1 h (noninoculated) medicarpin‐ and mock‐treated R108 leaves. Data represent
  the mean ± SEM of six biological replicates from two independent experiments. Significant
  differences between treatments and between time points were computed by unpaired
  t test (*p < 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤ 0.001, ****p ≤ 0.0001). PAL, phenylalanine
  ammonia‐lyase; ICS1, isochorismate synthase 1; PR1, pathogenesis‐related 1; PR2,
  pathogenesis‐related 2; PR5, pathogenesis‐related 5; PR10, pathogenesis‐related
  10; LOX3, lipoxygenase 3; LOX4, lipoxygenase 4; AOS1, allene oxide synthase 1; AOC,
  allene oxide cyclase; VSP1, vegetative storage protein 1; IFS1, isoflavone synthase
  1; IFR, isoflavone reductase
