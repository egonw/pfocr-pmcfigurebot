caption: Schematic model illustrating KLF7 promoting COAD progression. KLF7 is overexpressed
  in COAD and can bind to the promoter region of PDGFB to promote its secretion. The
  secreted PDGFB then binds to its receptor PDGFRβ, activating downstream pathways
  that promote COAD progression. Sunitinib can inhibit PDGFRβ, thereby blocking this
  secretory signaling pathway and inhibiting COAD progression.
