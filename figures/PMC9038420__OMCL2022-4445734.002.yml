caption: Keap1-Nrf2 pathway during constitutive and activative status. Nrf2 is adhered
  in the cytoplasm by Keap1 under normal physiological conditions. Keap1, as a substrate
  of the Cullin 3- (Cul3-) dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, promotes Nrf2 ubiquitination
  and is rapidly hydrolyzed by the proteasome. While cells are attacked by ROS, Nrf2
  dissociates from Keap1 and migrates rapidly to the nucleus. It first forms heterodimers
  with Maf proteins, then binds to antioxidant response elements (AREs), and regulates
  transcriptional activation of antioxidant oxidase gene expression. In addition,
  Nrf2 also has alternative activation pathways, which are regulated by phosphorylation,
  PKC, PI3K/Akt, and JNK to further alter the transcriptional activation of antioxidant
  genes. miRNA was also found to enhance Nrf2 activity by inhibiting Keap1 expression.
