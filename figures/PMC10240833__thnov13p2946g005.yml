caption: 'The performance of the mice in the Barns maze and new object recognition
  test. (A) Experimental protocol of the Barns maze (BM). (B) Representative searching
  paths during probe trial. (C) Chemogenetic activation of the HPC-mPFC pathway improves
  the LPS-induced learning deficits (*: CNO+LPS versus LPS; #: LPS+NBQX+CNO versus
  LPS; &: LPS+D-AP5+CNO versus LPS). (D-E) Activation of HPC-mPFC may improve the
  LPS-induced spatial memory deficit, but the effect was blocked by glutamate receptor
  inhibitors (D-AP5 and NBQX). (F) Motor function was not affected. (G) Experimental
  protocol for CNO injections using the new object recognition (NOR). (H) LPS group
  showed significantly worse recognition memory than controls, while activation of
  HPC-mPFC signaling pathway may improve the memory (LPS versus Ctrl; LPS+CNO versus
  LPS). This effect of HPC-mPFC was blocked by the glutamate receptor inhibitors (LPS+NBQX/D-AP5+CNO
  versus LPS+CNO). Data were presented as mean Â± SEM. n=6/group. * p < 0.05, ** p
  < 0.01.'
