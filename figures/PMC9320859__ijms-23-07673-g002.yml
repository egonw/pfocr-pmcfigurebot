caption: Effect of AdoMet alone and in combination with miR-34a, miR-34c, and miR-449a
  mimics or inhibitors on CRC cell migration. Confluent monolayers of HCT-116 (A)
  and Caco-2 (B) cells treated or not (Control) with 500 μM AdoMet alone or in combination
  with miR-34a, miR-34c, and miR-449a mimics or inhibitors for 48 h, were scratched
  with a micropipette tip and snapshot pictures were captured by microscope to check
  for wound closure. Pictures of the wounds corresponding to time zero (T0) and 24
  h (T1) from the scrape in both cell lines are reported. Histograms show the quantification
  of wound area calculated as a percentage of the control using ImageJ software 1.48v
  (U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Data represent the average
  of three independent experiments. The means and SD are shown. The means were compared
  using analysis of variance (ANOVA) plus Bonferroni’s t-test. * p < 0.05, ** p <
  0.01 versus untreated cells (Control).
