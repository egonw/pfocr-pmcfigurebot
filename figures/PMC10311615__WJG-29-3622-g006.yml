caption: 'The results of TMT proteomic analysis and MDC staining assay. A: TMT proteomic
  analysis of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) volcano map; B: Gene Ontology
  (GO) enrichment analysis of DEPs. The Y axis denotes the GO functional classification
  enriched of DEPs, and the X axis denotes the -Log10 of the P value of Fisher’s exact
  test of the significance of the enrichment; C: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
  (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. The Y axis denotes the categories of KEGG pathways.
  The X axis is the -Log10 of the p value of Fisher’s exact test of the significance
  of enrichment; D: GO annotation analysis of DEPs; E: Subcellular localization analysis;
  F: Protein domain enrichment analysis; G: Proteins cluster analysis; H: Protein-protein
  interaction network diagram of TGM2 and autophagy marker proteins; I: The MDC staining
  results of AGS cells treated with different concentrations of 18β-glycyrrhetinic
  acid (18β-GRA); J: Statistical results of the MDC staining in AGS cells; K: The
  MDC staining results of HGC-27 cells treated with different concentrations of 18β-GRA;
  L: Statistical results of the MDC staining in HGC-27 cells. All data are from three
  independent samples. The data is represented as the mean ± SD. aP < 0.05, bP < 0.01,
  cP < 0.001. DEPs: Differentially expressed proteins; GO: Gene Ontology; KEGG: Kyoto
  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; 18β-GRA: 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid.'
