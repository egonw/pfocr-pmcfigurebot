caption: HC-Pro involves the StEXA1-mediated recessive resistance against PVYO. a
  Schematic illustration of the genomic structure of PVYO, PVYN, PVYN:O, and PVYNTN
  based on their sequence sources. Black and gray bars represent the genomic sequences
  derived from PVYN and PVYO, respectively. The genome size, corresponding protein
  names, and positions are indicated in the top row of the structural diagram. b and
  c The viruses accumulate and symptoms develop in the RiStEXA1 and control plants
  (WT) inoculated with PVYO (b) and PVYO/HC-ProN(c). Relative virus accumulation was
  determined using qRT–PCR with total RNAs extracted from the non-inoculated upper
  leaves at 10 and 15 dpi. Symptoms on plants and systemic leaves were observed and
  photos were taken at ~25 dpi. Data are presented as means ± SD (n = 3) relative
  to WT plants, and EF1α was used as the normalizer. Three independent experiments
  were performed with similar results. Asterisks indicate statistically significant
  differences according to Student’s t test (**P < 0.01).
