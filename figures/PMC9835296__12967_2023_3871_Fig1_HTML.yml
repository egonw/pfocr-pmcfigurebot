caption: 'AFAP1L1 is significantly upregulated in GC tissues and cell lines. A The
  expression of AFAP family members in GC tissues and normal gastric tissues was analyzed
  using TCGA STAD data. B Comparing the expression level of AFAP family members in
  GC tissues and normal gastric tissues using GES27342 database. C qRT-PCR analysis
  of AFAP1L1 mRNA expression in 40 pairs of randomly selected snap-frozen GC tissues
  and ANGTs. The mRNA expression of AFAP1L1 in GC tissues with or without LNM was
  further compared. D Western blot analysis of AFAP1L1 protein expression in representative
  ANGTs and GC tissues with LNM (lower panel) or without LNM (upper panel). The results
  were compared in the right boxplot. E The expression of AFAP1L1 in TCGA STAD database
  stratified by the number of LNM. F Representative IHC staining for AFAP1L1 in ANGT,
  GC without LNM and GC with LNM (left panel). IHC staining score of AFAP1L1 in ANGT,
  GC without LNM and GC with LNM was compared (right panel). G The mRNA and protein
  expression of AFAP1L1 in gastric mucosal epithelial cell line GES-1 and five GC
  cell lines. ANGT: adjacent nontumorous gastric tissue; T: gastric cancer tissue;
  LNM: lymph node metastasis. *P < 0.05; ***P < 0.001'
