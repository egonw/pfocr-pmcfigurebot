figure_title: Type III IFN receptor expression in DN B cells
caption: A) Gene set enrichment analysis for genes upregulated in SLE DN B cells from
  bulk transcriptomic analysis. Pathways ranked by significance. Color of bar indicates
  number of genes identified in the pathway. B) Log2 Counts-per-million for interferon
  receptor gene transcripts in SLE and healthy controls from bulk transcriptomic analysis.
  Negative binomial regressions with subject-level random effect and fixed effects
  for disease, B cell subset and their interaction were fit for each gene. Genes with
  Bayes’ factors favoring the aforementioned model and individual comparisons with
  Bayesian p-values < 0.05 are reported. C) Representative dot plots of DN B cells
  from healthy donor, SLE with low, and SLE with high CD11c+ CD21- cells as measured
  by flow cytometry in samples used for bulk RNA-seq transcriptomic analysis (top).
  CD11c+ CD21- Frequency amongst Naïve and DN B cells from healthy and SLE samples
  (bottom). Statistics calculated by Mann-Whitney U Test. ** P<0.01. D) Linear regression
  of expression of type III IFN receptor transcript vs frequency of CD11c+ CD21- (%
  cells) in naive and DN B cells subsets from healthy and SLE donors. Goodness of
  fit (r2) and p-value (F test) shown. E) Heat map of genes correlated with IFNLR1
  transcript (pink) in SLE DN bulk transcriptomic analysis. Percentage of CD11c+ CD21-
  cells in each sample shown in gold. Increasing IFNLR1 transcript was associated
  with an increase in frequency of CD11c+ CD21- cells in the sample as measured by
  flow cytometry and increase in DN2-associated mRNA transcripts FCRL5 and ZEB2 and
  decrease transcript for negative markers for DN2 cells (such as CD27 and CXCR5)
  as measured by bulk RNA-seq
