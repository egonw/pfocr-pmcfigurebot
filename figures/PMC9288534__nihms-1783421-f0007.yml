figure_title: Pathway analysis of chemical gene lists
caption: 'Results for pathway enrichment analysis chemicals detected at higher levels
  in non-Hispanic Black vs. non-Hispanic White women. Gene lists for each chemical
  were analyzed using DAVID pathway analysis software. -Iog10(p-values) are shown
  for each pathway. Results are shown for the relevant following biological pathways:
  Inflammatory Response”, “Aging” and “Response to Estradiol”.'
