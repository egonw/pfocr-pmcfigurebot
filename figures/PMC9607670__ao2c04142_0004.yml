caption: 'Pretreatment with TLB protected against renal oxidative stress induced by
  cisplatin. Effect of TLB on the expression of the MAPK signaling pathway; the column
  chart shows antibody relative expression (A,B,C,D). The protein expression was examined
  by western blot analysis in kidney tissues from control, cisplatin, cisplatin +
  TLB (50 mg/kg), and cisplatin + TLB (100 mg/kg). All data were expressed as mean
  Â± SD, n = 8. **p < 0.01 vs control group; #p < 0.05, and ##p < 0.01 vs cisplatin
  group.'
