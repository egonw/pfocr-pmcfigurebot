caption: CF does not regulate the NF-κB signaling pathway. (A–C) RAW264.7 macrophage
  cells were treated with CF (0.1 and 1 µM) for 30 min before treatment with LPS (500
  ng/mL) for 6 h. Western blot analysis was performed with anti-phospho-NF-κB (p65)
  and anti-phospho-IκB antibodies (A) and then quantified (B,C). (D) The NF-κB-luciferase
  reporter vector was transfected into RAW264.7 cells. After 24 h, the cells were
  pretreated with CF for 30 min before LPS (500 ng/mL) treatment for 6 h, and luciferase
  activity was measured. The graphs are the mean ± SD of three separate experiments.
