figure_title: A2BAR signaling in IECs is required for their activation at the initiation
  of the primary response to Hpb
caption: (A–E) VillinCre-A2BARfl/fl and corresponding control VillinCre mice were
  orally inoculated with 200 Hpb L3; controls included naive mice orally gavaged with
  PBS. At 24 h after Hpb inoculation, IECs were sort purified, RNA was extracted,
  and RNA-seq was performed. Analyses included a heatmap representing the Euclidean
  distance matrix of the total transcriptome of each sample, along with hierarchical
  clustering (A); principal-component analysis (PCA) of the total transcriptome of
  each sample (B); and volcano plots (C); Venn diagram depicting the number of upregulated
  and downregulated genes with a shared and unique expression from VillinCre-A2BARfl/fl
  and corresponding controls VillinCre mice relative to naive (D); regulated gene
  pathways and processes as determined by enrichment Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)
  (E).(F and G) Further analyses revealed heatmaps representing G protein-coupled
  receptor signaling (F) and type 2 immune response genes (G).(H) VillinCre-A2BARfl/fl
  mice and VillinCre controls were inoculated with 200 L3 Hpb for 24 h. RNA from sorted
  IECs (EpCAM+CD45−DAPI−) was extracted and analyzed for gene expression of Il33 by
  qPCR. Data shown are the means and SEMs from 4 individual mice per group. qPCR experiment
  shows the means and SEMs from 4–6 individual mice per group and are representative
  of at least 2 independent experiments (1-way ANOVA, multiple comparisons; *p < 0.05).
