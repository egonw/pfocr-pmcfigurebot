caption: 'CPP inhibits PHD2 activity in HDFs. (a–c) HDFs were treated with CPP (10
  μM) for 3, 6, 12 and 24 h, after which immunofluorescence was used to detect the
  co-localization of CPP and HIF-1α, or CPP and PHD2. Scale bars: 20 μm. (d,e) CPP
  inhibited PHD2 activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner. HDFs were treated
  with CPP at 0, 10 or 20 μM, for 6, 12, 24 h, or 4 days (D4) or 6 days (D6), respectively,
  after which the effects of CPP on PHD2 activity were measured using a PHD2 enzyme-linked
  immunoassay kit. Data are presented as means ± SEM, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, ***
  p < 0.001, n = 3.'
