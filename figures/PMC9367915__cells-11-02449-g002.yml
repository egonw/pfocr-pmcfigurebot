caption: DDR/Hippo/Notch pathway interplay in prostate cancer. Schematic representation
  of the DDR/Hippo/Notch pathway crosstalk in prostate cancer through the AR, ERG,
  AKT and TLK1 molecular hubs (1–4) boxed in yellow. Stimulatory effects between different
  pathway components are represented with blue lines while inhibitory signals are
  marked in red.
