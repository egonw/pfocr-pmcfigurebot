caption: 'SGLT2 Inhibitors Versus GLP-1RAs on Cardiovascular OutcomesThe bars represent
  absolute effects of treatment per 1,000 patients treated for 5 years for patients
  at very low risk (no cardiovascular risk factors), low risk (3 or more cardiovascular
  risk factors), moderate risk (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease), high risk
  (chronic kidney disease), and very high risk (atherosclerotic vascular disease plus
  chronic kidney disease). (A) All-cause death: SGLT2 inhibitor and GLP-1RA compared
  with placebo. (B) All-cause death: SGLT2 inhibitor compared with GLP-1RA. (C) Cardiovascular
  death: SGLT2 inhibitor and GLP-1RA compared with placebo. (D) Nonfatal myocardial
  infarction: SGLT2 inhibitor and GLP-1RA compared with placebo. (E) Nonfatal stroke:
  SGLT2 inhibitor and GLP-1RA compared with placebo. (F) Nonfatal stroke: SGLT2 inhibitor
  compared with GLP-1RA. Adapted from Palmer et al () with permission. ARR = absolute
  risk reduction; other abbreviations as in .'
