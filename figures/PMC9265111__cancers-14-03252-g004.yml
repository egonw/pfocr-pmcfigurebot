caption: 'Four frequently mutated genes in CRC (SMAD4, FBXW7, ARID1A, or BMPR2) are
  involved in the TGF-β/BMP pathway. (A) Scheme of the TGF-β/BMP pathway with four
  frequently mutated genes in CRC (circled): SMAD4 = mothers against decapentaplegic
  homolog 4, FBXW7 = F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 7, ARID1A = AT-rich interactive
  domain-containing protein 1A, BMPR2 = Bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II.
  (B) Frequency of SFAB (SMAD4, FBXW7, ARID1A, or BMPR2) in CRC patients (TCGA = The
  Cancer Genome Atlas, PanCancer Atlas colorectal adenocarcinomas (n = 594) (https://www.cbioportal.org,
  accessed on 18 August 2021)). (C) Frequency of SFAB in CRC PDOs (n = 62). (See also
