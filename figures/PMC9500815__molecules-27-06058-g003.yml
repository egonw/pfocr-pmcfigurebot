caption: 'Expression of OPG (A), RANKL (B), NF-κB (C) mRNA as detected by quantitative
  RT-PCR (x ± SD). Error bars represent standard deviations (n = 3). As compared with
  the control group, ## p < 0.05 indicates that mRNA expression levels of OPG and
  NF-κB decreased and the mRNA expression level of RANKL increased in the arthritis
  model (AA) group. As compared with the AA group, ** p < 0.01 indicates that groups
  of treated arthritic rats exhibited increased expression of OPG mRNA, decreased
  expression of RANKL mRNA, and significant inhibition of NF-κB signaling pathway
  activity.'
