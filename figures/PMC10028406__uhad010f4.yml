caption: Carotenoid biosynthetic pathway and expression levels of carotenoid biosynthetic-related
  genes in the storage roots of IbNAC29-OE plants. a General carotenoid biosynthetic
  pathway in plants. b MEP pathway gene, IbDXS, for carotenoid precursor supply. c–f
  Carotene biosynthetic genes, including IbGGPPS, IbPSY, IbLCYE, and IbLCYB. g–k Xanthophyll
  biosynthetic genes, including IbCYP97A3, IbCYP97C1, IbBCH, IbZEP, and IbCCS. IbActin
  was used as the internal control. The transcript level in WT was set as control.
  Error bars indicate SD (n = 3). * and ** indicate a significant difference from
  that of WT at P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively, by Student’s t-test.

  accumulation in sweet potato.
