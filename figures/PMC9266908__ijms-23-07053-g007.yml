caption: 'AKT/PI3K and ERK1/2/MAPK dual pathway determination was performed according
  to the MuseTM PI3K/MAPK Dual Pathway activation kit. Graphs correspond to Jurkat
  cells. Treatments included cells not treated and cells incubated with IC50 of HT
  for 24 h. Top: dot plots show a representative experiment of the treatments. Bottom:
  represents, using bar diagrams, the percentages of non-activated cells and cells
  activated with PI3K, MAPK and Dual pathway. Values are expressed as mean ± SEM (n
  = 12). The asterisk indicates significant differences in the different activated
  pathways between control and treated cells (p < 0.001). ERK1/2, Extracellular regulated
  kinase ½ (Protein-serine/threonine kinases); MAPK, Mitogen-activated protein kinase;
  AKT/PI3K, Protein kinase B/Phosphoinositide 3-kinase.'
