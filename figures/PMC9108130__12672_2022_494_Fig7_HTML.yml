caption: 'KLF14 targets ITGB1 and inhibits the development of cervical cancer through
  the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway. A Four groups were established: Lv-control (ITGB1),
  Lv-ITGB1, Lv-ITGB1 + Lv-control (KLF14) and Lv-ITGB1 + Lv-KLF14 (the KLF14 overexpression
  lentivirus and its negative control lentivirus were transfected into SiHa cells
  transfected with Lv-ITGB1). When ITGB1 was overexpressed, compared to the Lv-control
  (ITGB1) group, the Western blot results showed that the expression of PDK1, AKT
  and p-AKT was upregulated, while Bax was downregulated. However, when Lv-KLF14 and
  Lv-ITGB1 were cotransfected, the expression of PDK1, AKT and p-AKT was downregulated
  compared to that in the Lv-ITGB1 + Lv-control (KLF14) group, while Bax was upregulated.
  B. Two groups were established: Lv-KLF14 + Lv-control (ITGB1) and Lv-KLF14 + Lv-ITGB1
  (the ITGB1 overexpression lentivirus and its negative control lentivirus were transfected
  into SiHa cells transfected with Lv-KLF14). For Lv-KLF14 + Lv-control (ITGB1) and
  Lv-KLF14 + Lv-ITGB1, the Western blot results showed that the expression of PDK1,
  AKT and p-AKT in the Lv-KLF14 + Lv-ITGB1 group was upregulated compared to that
  in the Lv-KLF14 + Lv-control (ITGB1) group, while Bax was downregulated. (*P < 0.05,
