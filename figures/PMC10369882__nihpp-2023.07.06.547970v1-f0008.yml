figure_title: Delayed normalization model qualitatively captures key orientation masking
  response features
caption: (A) Schematic of the normalization model showing the visual input being processed
  by separate excitatory and normalization signal pathways. The normalization pathway
  in particular was modelled with a slightly delayed temporal kinetics and wider orientation
  tuning curves. The excitatory signal undergoes divisive normalization prior to neural
  output. (B-D) Modelled columnar response output. (B) Modelled response of oriented
  backgrounds as in . (C) Modelled response of background with additive target as
  in , and the modelled response of the small Gabor target in black. (D) The target
  evoked response by subtracting the background only response (B) from (C), matching
  the biphasic observation in . (E) Correlation of modelled behavioral performance
  against each time frame of the modelled response, illustrating the early phase where
  the response was negatively correlated to behavioral choice, and the late phase
  with positive correlations. (F-I) Modelled time course of the population tuning
  vector. (F) Modelled populating tuning trajectory of the background only stimuli
  (color coded) as in . (G) Modelled populating tuning trajectory of the background
  with additive target illustrating the turn towards a convergent point on the x-axis
  as in . (H) Modelled target evoked response trajectory from subtracting (F) from
  (G). (I) Modelled populating tuning trajectory of the target only trials as in .
