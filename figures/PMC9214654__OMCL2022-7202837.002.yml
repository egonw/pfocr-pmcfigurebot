caption: 'The expressions of TLR4 and HH pathway components (SHH, SMO, and Gli1) in
  the placentas and PMSCs from the patients with PE. (a) Western blot analysis of
  TLR4, SHH, SMO, and Gli1 protein expression and quantitative analysis of TLR4, SHH,
  SMO, and Gli1 in the normal and preeclamptic placentas. Protein data were normalized
  to β-actin. (b)–(e) Double labeling the immunofluorescence analysis of TLR4 (b),
  SHH (c), SMO (d), and Gli1(e) protein expression and localization in the placentae
  from full-term normal pregnancies and preeclampsia patients. TLR4, SHH, SMO, and
  Gli1 (red). DAPI (blue). CD90 (green) for PMSCs localization. (f) Western blot analysis
  of TLR4, SHH, SMO, and Gli1 protein expression and quantitative analysis of TLR4,
  SHH, SMO, and Gli1 in the normal and preeclamptic PMSCs. Scale bar: 200 μm. Data
  are presented as the mean ± SD. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗P <
  0.0001 by Student''s t-test. SD: Standard deviation.'
