  in culture display widespread genomic instability while retaining intact p53 pathway,

caption: DNA content analysis in C57#1 DLP and C57#3 DLP mouse prostate organoid lines.Quantification
  of spectral karyotype (SKY) longitudinal analysis in C57#1 DLP mouse prostate organoids
  undergoing adaptation to the absence of A83‐01 in culture (related to Fig ). During
  adaptation, an early genome duplication event is observed followed by selective
  chromosome loss and gains, and leading to subtetraploidy (n = 2 biological replicates,
  25 metaphases/condition).Representative dual‐color FISH images for X and Y chromosomes
  in C57#1 DLP mouse prostate organoids during adaptation to the absence of A83‐01
  in culture. This analysis confirmed a progressive sex chromosome imbalance during
  adaptation. Scale bars = 5 μm.Representative stereoscopic images of C57#1 DLP mouse
  prostate organoids treated with Nutlin, or vehicle as control. Scale bar = 1 mm.Western
  blot analysis of C57#1 DLP mouse prostate organoids described in (D).Western blot
  analysis in C57#1 DLP mouse prostate organoids treated with doxorubicin or X‐rays.
  C57#1 DLP mouse prostate organoids retain a functional p53 pathway.  Source data
  are available online for this figure.
