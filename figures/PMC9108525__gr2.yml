caption: 'Biogenesis of exosomes: Exosome biogenesis First, endocytosis can be mediated
  by either a clathrin-dependant or clathrin-independent pathway, which is often active
  at the lipid raft, which contains a variety of tumour-specific receptors and signalling
  proteins (e.g., growth factor receptors, oncoproteins), as well as common membrane
  proteins like tetraspanins. Exosome biogenesis can be accomplished in either an
  ESCRT-dependant or ESCRT-independent manner via the endosomal network. Exosomes
  (intraluminal vesicles) reveal inward budding of the multivesicular structures as
  a result (MVB).'
