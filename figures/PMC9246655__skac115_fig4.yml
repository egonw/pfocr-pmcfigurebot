caption: A depiction of the regulators of RAR signaling identified in each dataset,
  modified from Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and based upon its database. The mRNAs
  that were greater on day 20 of pregnancy are depicted in gold, whereas those that
  were less on day 20 of pregnancy are depicted in blue. Components of the pathway
  not regulated in the present dataset are shown in black boxes. mRNAs that were only
  regulated in dataset 1 are labeled (1) and those only regulated in dataset 2 are
  labeled (2). Conversion of retinyl esters and retinol to retinoic acid can occur
  via the enzymatic action of PNPLA4, AKR1C4, DHRS3, and RDH12, all of which were
  regulated in the CL during early pregnancy. Retinoic acid inhibits the activity
  of MAP3K5 via increased phosphorylation of PTEN and activation of the PTEN pathway,
  and increases activation of adenylate cyclase (ADCY5), leading to phosphorylation
  of RAR by protein kinase A (PKA). Downregulation of MAP3K5 may ultimately lead to
  a reduced activation of the AP-1 complex (FOS/JUN), through a reduction in JNK signaling.
  The AP-1 complex may also be inhibited by the RAR/RXR heterodimer, and there may
  also be other proteinâ€“protein interactions between these two transcription factors.
  MAP3K1 inhibits the binding activity of SMRT. Both SMRT and ZBTB16 can bind to RAR
  prior to heterodimer formation and inhibit the activity of RAR. PML, TRIM 24, and
  SMARCD3 can all increase the activation and thus the transcriptional activity of
  the RAR/RXR heterodimer. Ultimately, alterations in these pathways regulate the
  activity of the RAR/RXR transcription factor, leading to downstream effects on retinoic
  acid-regulated genes, including AKR1C4, DHRS3, IGFBP3, and RDH12. FOS, fos proto-oncogene,
  AP-1 transcription factor subunit; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinases; JUN, jun proto-oncogene,
  AP-1 transcription factor subunit; PKA, protein kinase A; PTEN, phosphatase and
  tensin homolog; RXR, retinoid X receptor.
