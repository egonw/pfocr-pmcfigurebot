caption: IL-10 production by CD4+ T cells is not influenced by STAT3 signaling pathway
  in cDC1 after antigen targeting to the DEC205 receptor. STAT3Flox/Flox and STAT3
  cKO mice were immunized as described in . Splenocytes were obtained 4 days after
  boosting. (A) Intracellular cytokine staining for IL-10. Plots show the percentage
  of IL-10-producing CD4+ T cells. (B) Intracellular staining of Ki67 in Tfh, pre-Tfh
  and non-Tfh cells cells performed by flow cytometry in spleen cells 4 days after
  immunization. Histograms represent non-Tfh cells in white, pre-Tfh cells in gray
  and Tfh cells in black. Bars show mean ± SD from three experiments pooled together
  (n=9 animals/group, except STAT3cKO immunized with poly(I:C), n=6 animals/group)
  in (A), and two experiments pooled together (n=6 animals/group) in (B) *p<0.05,
  **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001, and ns not significant; one-way ANOVA followed
  by Tukey’s post-test.
