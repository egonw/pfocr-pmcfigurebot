caption: SNHG22 drives trophoblast migration and invasion. (A) SNHG22 expression in
  normal placenta (n = 25) and PE placenta (n = 25) tissues was revealed by qPCR test.
  (B) SNHG22 expression in normal placenta (n = 8) and PE placenta tissues (n = 13)
  was analyzed in a public database (GSE102897). (C and D). SNHG22 was overexpressed
  or silenced in trophoblasts, and the transfection efficacy was examined by a qPCR
  test. Wound healing (E and F) and Transwell (G and H) assays estimated the migration
  and invasion of trophoblasts after increasing or decreasing SNHG22 expression. Experiments
  were replicated three times. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.
  Data are expressed as mean±SD.

  axis and activates PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
