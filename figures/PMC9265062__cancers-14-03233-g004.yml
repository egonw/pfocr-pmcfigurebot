caption: Genotype-to-phenotype correlations for each of the three tumor suppressors
  (TP53, RB1 and PTEN) using 20 MDA PCa PDX samples. (A) Correlations between the
  log2 ratios of the copy number variations for each of the tumor suppressors (TP53,
  RB1 and PTEN) identified by T200 analyses, and the transcriptional scores for tumor
  suppressor pathway loss. The orange line indicates the cutoff used to infer deep
  deletion (x = âˆ’0.8). The blue line is the ordinary least squares regression fit.
  The grey shaded region around each line is a 95% confidence interval set for the
  fit. The correlation (R) and significance of correlation (p-value for testing if
  correlation is 0) are included in each plot in blue text. Also shown is the categorization
  of each sample as normal (green dot) or abnormal (red dot) based on immunohistochemical
  (IHC) analyses. Samples harboring single nucleotide variations (mutations) are numbered.
  (B) Location of the identified mutations on the primary protein structure of the
  corresponding TSP, and the epitopes recognized by antibodies used for IHC staining.
  Nonsense mutations are shown as yellow dots, and missense mutations are shown as
  green dots. No mutations were identified for PTEN. Key functional domains are highlighted
  for p53 protein (trans-activation domain (TAD), DNA binding domain (DBD) and the
  oligomerization domain (tetramer)), RB1 protein (small pocket region containing
  the A (RB_A) and B (RB_B) domains and the C-terminal domain (RB_C)), and PTEN protein
  (phosphatase domain (PTEN_PTase) and C2 domain (PTEN_C2)).
