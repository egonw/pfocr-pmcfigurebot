caption: CRNDE promoted ATC proliferation via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
  (A) The dot plot of gene enrichment analysis results; (B) The canonical plot of
  gene set enrichment analysis results; (C) correlation between CRNDE and Wnt/β-catenin-related
  molecules in THCA samples from TCGA database; (D) the effect of CRNDE on the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway was detected by western blotting. *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01; ***,
