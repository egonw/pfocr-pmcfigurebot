caption: Z-Ajoene-induced NSCLC cell apoptosis is associated with enhanced ERS. (a)
  Flow cytometry revealed reduced apoptosis in cells co-treated with Z-ajoene and
  4-PBA (an ERS inhibitor). (b) Western blot showed lower Bax, cleaved caspase 3,
  and cleaved caspase 9 expressions and higher Bcl-2 expression detected in cells
  cotreated with Z-ajoene and 4-PBA versus Z-ajoene-treated controls.
