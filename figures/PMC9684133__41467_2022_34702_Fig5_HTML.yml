figure_title: DIO3OS interacts with PTBP1 to upregulate LDHA mRNA stability
caption: a Schematic diagram of alternative splicing (AS) analysis for RNA-seq of
  MCF-7 LTED cells with or without DIO3OS/PTBP1 knockdown (KD). b Venn diagram of
  the differentially spliced events in MCF-7 LTED cells transfected with control LNA/siRNA
  and DIO3OS LNA or PTBP1 siRNA. c Pie chart of twelve types of the differentially
  splicing events occurred in DIO3OS/PTBP1-knockdown MCF-7 LTED cells. d KEGG pathway
  enrichment of the differentially spliced genes in DIO3OS/PTBP1-knockdown MCF-7 LTED
  cells using the DAVID bioinformatics tool are plotted as the −log2P-value. e LC-MS
  analysis of lactate production in MCF-7 LTED cells with indicated treatment. f PCR
  and agarose gel of the 5’/3’UTR of LDHA mRNA in MCF-7 LTED cells with indicated
  treatment. g qRT-PCR of LDHA mRNA in MCF-7 LTED cells with indicated treatment.
  h Immunoblot of LDHA expression in MCF-7 LTED cells with indicated treatment. MW
  molecular weight. i Half-life of LDHA mRNA in MCF-7 LTED cells with indicated treatment
  was determined by using 10 µg/mL actinomycin D (ActD) at indicated time points.
  j RNA immunoprecipitation assay with the anti-PTBP1 antibody revealing the interaction
  of PTBP1 and LDHA variant harboring 3’UTR in parental and LTED MCF-7 cells with
  indicated treatments. k Schematic diagram of the full length of two different LDHA
  variant-expressing plasmids, and the luciferase reporter plasmids fused with different
  5’/3’UTR sequences of LDHA. l Biotin-RNA pulldown followed by western blot demonstrating
  the interaction of PTBP1 and different LDHA variants with or without intact 3’UTR.
  MW molecular weight. m RNA immunoprecipitation assay with the anti-PTBP1 antibody
  revealing the interaction of PTBP1 and LDHA 5’/3’UTR in MCF-7 LTED cells transfected
  with different LDHA-UTR-fused luciferase reporter plasmids. n Luciferase reporter
  assay in MCF-7 LTED with indicated treatment. Means ± s.d. of n = 3 (e, g, j, m,
  n) or n = 4 (i) independent experiments yielding similar results, one representative
  experiment out of three that were similar (f, h, l) are shown, and P-values were
  analyzed using two-tailed Student’s t-test (e, j, m), two-sided one-way ANOVA with
  Dunnett’s multiple-comparisons test (g, i, n). Source data are provided as a Source
