figure_title: KIF15 correlated with PC metastasis and accelerated FA disassembly
caption: 'A Immunohistochemical analysis of KIF15 expression in non-metastatic and
  metastatic pancreatic cancer tissues. B Immunofluorescence analysis of focal adhesions
  (Paxillin: green, microtubules: red) in the tails of cells of negative control (Vector)
  and KIF15-overexpressed PC cells. C Western blot analysis of the Integrin/FAK signaling
  pathway in cells with interference or overexpression of KIF15. D PANC-1 and Mia
  PaCa-2 cells were incubated with 10 mM nacodazole, followed by drug washout for
  40 min. Relative levels of FAK phosphorylated on Y397 were quantified by scanning
  densitometry and normalized to levels of GAPDH. E PANC-1 cell was incubated with
  10 mM nacodazole, followed by drug washout for 40 min. Representative immunofluorescence
  analysis of focal adhesion disassembly (Paxillin: green, microtubules: red). All
  data represent means ± SEM; ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01; *P < 0.05; two-tailed Student’s
  t test.'
