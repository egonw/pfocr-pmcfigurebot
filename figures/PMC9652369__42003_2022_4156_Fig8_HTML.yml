figure_title: A working model of the metabolic switch in chondrocytes during hypertrophy
caption: a As chondrocytes progress from a proliferating state to a hypertrophic state
  in the growth plate, they undergo a metabolic switch from a state of high glycolysis
  to a state of high oxidative phosphorylation and pentose phosphate pathway activity.
  b IGF2 balances the metabolic switch, such that when it is removed, hypertrophic
  Igf2 null chondrocytes experience heightened oxidative phosphorylation compared
  to WT chondrocytes.
article_title: A critical bioenergetic switch is regulated by IGF2 during murine cartilage
  development.
