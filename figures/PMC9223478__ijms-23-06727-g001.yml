caption: Changes in food intake and appetite genes of essential amino acids via intracerebroventricular
  administration. (A) Food intake within 24 h. The ratio of the quality of the bait
  fish to the quality of the mandarin fish represented the food intake of the single-tailed
  mandarin fish (g/g). (B) Transcript levels of genes representing the appetite in
  lysine (4 h) or methionine (24 h) in brain tissue. Values are means ± SEMs, n =
  12. * p < 0.05, determined by Student’s two-tailed t-test.
