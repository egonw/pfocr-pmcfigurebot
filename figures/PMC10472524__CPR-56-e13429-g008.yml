caption: 'Decellularised spinal cord matrix (DSCM) promoted immature gene expression
  of human spinal cord‐derived primary astrocytes (hspASCs) and was insensitive to
  TNF‐α stimulation via increasing mesenchyme‐related genes expression. (A) Heatmap
  shows the significantly differentially expressed immature/mature‐related genes in
  hspASCs. The colour scale represents log2 (DSCM/COLI), and R1–R4 represent four
  biological repeats. (B) Proliferation score of hspASCs under DSCM/COLI condition.
  (C) Selective significantly up‐regulation enriched kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG)
  pathway and GO terms in hspASCs cultured on DSCM. (D) Immunofluorescence analysis
  of GFAP and Nestin expression in hspASCs (Scale Bar: 50 μm). (E) Western blotting
  analysis of the protein expression in hspASCs (Immature marker: NES, EGFR; mature
  marker: GFAP; proliferation marker: PCNA). (F) Heatmap shows the significantly differentially
  expressed cytokine receptors in hspASCs. (G) Western blotting analysis of TNFR1
  expression in hspASCs. (H) Western blotting analysis of p‐IκBα/IκBα level after
  20 ng/mL TNF‐α stimulation in hspASCs. (I) Quantitative polymerase chain reaction
  (qPCR) measures the relative gene expression of IL‐1β and IL6 in hspASCs after 24 h
  of 20 ng/mL TNF‐α stimulation. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01 (t‐test, mean ± SEM). (J,K)
  Western blot and qPCR analysis of mesenchymal‐related gene expression in hspASCs.
  **p < 0.01 (t‐test, mean ± SEM). ECM, extracellular matrix.'
