caption: 'CXCL3 expression regulated the Erk pathway to influence the metastasis of
  solamargine-cervical cancer cells. (a, b) Solamargine-treated cells with CXCL3 overexpression
  in the absence or presence of PD98059 (specific Erk1/2 inhibitor) for 24 h; the
  protein expression of CXCL3 was detected by western blot. (c) The cervical cancer
  cells were treated as above and measured the cell migration by scratch test (×100
  magnification, scale bar = 100 μm). (d) The cervical cancer cells were treated as
  above and measured invasive capacity by transwell assay (×250 magnification, scale
  bar = 50 μm). (e, f) Western blot was performed to measure MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein
  levels in solamargine-treated cells after the upregulation of CXCL3 and the inhibition
  of the Erk pathway. GAPDH served as the loading control. ∗∗∗p < 0.001 vs. control;
  ###p < 0.001 vs. solamargine + NC; and &p < 0.01 and &&p < 0.001 vs. solamargine + CXCL3.
  h, hours; MMP-2, matrix metalloproteinase 2; MMP-9, matrix metalloproteinase 9;
  CXCL3, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 3; NC, negative control.'
