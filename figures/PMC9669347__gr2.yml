caption: Effects of ST water extract on cell cycle of HL7702 and cell cycle-related
  proteins. (A) ST water extract accumulated HL7702 cells in S phase and G2/M phase.
  (B) The percentage of S phase. (C) The percentage of G2/M phase. (D) Representative
  Western blots of Cyclin D1 and CDK4. (E) Quantitation of Cyclin D1/β-actin. (F)
  Quantitation of CDK4/β-actin. Data were presented as mean ± SD. of three independent
  experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 vs control group.
