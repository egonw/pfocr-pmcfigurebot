caption: miR-214-3p levels increased and PTEN levels decreased in vitro and in vivo.
  (a) HK-2 cells displayed typical mesenchymal morphology after TGF-β1 treatment for
  48 h. Scale bars, 200 μm. (b) Histopathological changes were observed by staining
  with Masson plus HE. Typical micrographs for various groups are displayed in the
  figure. Blue–purple collagen was deposited on the Masson-stained image. Scale bars,
  100 μm. (c, d) qRT–PCR-based expressions of miR-214-3p in the control, TGF-β1, sham,
  and UUO groups, and the internal reference miRNA was U6. (e, f) qRT–PCR-based mRNA
  expressions of PTEN, COL1, FN, and α-SMA. We chose GAPDH as an internal control
  for other genes. (g–j) Western blot results including PTEN, α-SMA, COL1, and FN
  in the control, TGF-β1, sham, and UUO groups. GAPDH was used as an internal reference
  for the other proteins. The data rendered are in terms of means ± SDs. n = 3. ∗P
  < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001 against the sham/control group.
