figure_title: Two examples of PMP action
caption: (A) Phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) is a PMP that consists of an
  enzymatic domain, a phosphatase domain (Ptase), and a lipid-binding C2 domain. PTEN
  binds to the inner leaflet of eukaryotic membranes, where Ptase dephosphorylates
  PI(3,4,5)P3 to form PI(4,5)P2. This process is part of a signalling pathway leading
  to apoptosis. (B) Cholera Toxin (Ctx) is also a PMP with an enzymatic domain, the
  A subunit, and a lipid-binding domain consisting of five B subunits. This B5 ring
  binds to the ganglioside GM1 and following the binding event, the complex is translocated
  into the cell by endocytosis. After translocation, the A subunit separates from
  the Ctx complex and carries out its cytotoxic mechanism.
