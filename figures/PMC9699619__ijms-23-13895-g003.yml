caption: 'NO and H2S applications in COVID-19. NO and H2S are antiviral agents with
  promise for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection through interference with entry, replication,
  and release. Both gasotransmitters also have potential applications in later-stage
  management of COVID-19. NO and H2S demonstrate the ability to inhibit leukocyte
  adhesion to the endothelium, reduce levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, curtail
  excessive iNOS activity, and overall reduce inflammatory damage. These properties,
  combined with their vaso- and bronchodilator actions in the pulmonary system, serve
  to reduce the need for mechanical ventilation and alleviate respiratory compromise.
  Additionally, NO and H2S downregulate the classical RAAS signaling pathway and its
  related pro-inflammatory shift by inhibiting Ang II and AT1R. As a result, NO and
  H2S may have significant potential in the management of COVID-19, a disease recognized
  for causing hyperinflammatory conditions and respiratory compromise and for having
  greater severity where the RAAS is imbalanced. Abbreviations: Ang II, angiotensin
  II; AT1R, angiotensin II type 1 receptor; COVID-19; coronavirus disease 2019; H2S,
  hydrogen sulfide; NO, nitric oxide; RAAS, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system;
  SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.'
