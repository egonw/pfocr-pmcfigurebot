caption: '(A): SPEED2 signaling pathway enrichment analysis of common targets between
  COVID-19 and asthma. (B): Tissue-specific expression analysis of the critical host
  factors (The vertical axis represents different tissues, and the horizontal axis
  represents the expression levels of 13 key host factors in each tissue. The expression
  levels of genes are measured by Transcripts Per Million (TPM). The darker the color,
  the higher the distribution of the corresponding host factor in a specific tissue).'
