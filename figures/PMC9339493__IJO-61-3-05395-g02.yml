caption: STAT3 plays varying roles in EC, such as promoting proliferation, infiltration,
  metastasis, and angiogenesis; inducing immune evasion, chemoresistance, and radioresistance;
  and upregulating the expression of cancer-related genes. Taken together, these properties
  explain the poor prognosis of patients with EC with upregulated levels of STAT3.
  STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; EC, esophageal cancer;
  VEGF, vascular endothelial factor; MMPs, matrix metalloproteinases; CXCR4, CXC chemokine
  receptor 4; NK, natural killer.
