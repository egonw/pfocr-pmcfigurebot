caption: 'Effects of COG1410 on hippocampal apoptosis at 72 h after cerebral I/R.
  (a) Representative images of TUNEL staining in the hippocampal CA1 area (×400);
  nuclei were labeled with blue fluorescence (DAPI), and TUNEL-positive cells were
  labeled with red fluorescence, scale bars = 20 μm. (b) Representative bands of Western
  blot data. (c) Quantitative analyses of TUNEL-positive cells in the hippocampal
  area. (d–f) Quantitative analysis of the Western blot bands. Data were represented
  as mean ± SEM. Western blot, n = 6 per group; TUNEL staining, n = 8 per group. ∗P
  < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. sham group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 vs. I/R + Vehicle group.'
