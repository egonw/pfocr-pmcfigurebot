caption: GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis for the yellow module. (A) Cellular
  component in GO enrichment analysis. The vertical bars show the number of genes
  identified by only 1 pathway and the intersection pathways. Single dots and the
  corresponding horizontal bars represent the number of genes that are unique for
  a pathway and not shared between the other pathways. (B) Molecular function in GO
  enrichment analysis. (C) Biological process in GO enrichment analysis. (D) KEGG
  pathway enrichment analysis. GO, Gene Ontology; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
  and Genomes.
