caption: The effect of RF on C. albicans coenzyme metabolism. (A) Clusters of orthologous
  groups analysis of downregulated differentially expressed genes was performed, and
  the main enrichment pathways are indicated by red arrows. (B and C) Schematic model
  of the endogenous thiamine metabolism pathway (B) and the endogenous riboflavin
  metabolism pathway (C). Genes encoding proteins in red were upregulated, while genes
  encoding proteins in green were downregulated. (D) The expression of genes involved
  in the thiamine and RF metabolic pathways was analyzed. (E) C. albicans cells with
  or without RF treatment were spotted onto YPD agar plates containing exogenous thiamine
  or RF. TPP, thiamine pyrophosphate. Data were analyzed by ANOVA (ns, P > 0.05; *,
  P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; ****, P < 0.0001).
