caption: Comparisons of glucagon concentration‐effect curves, generated in rat hepatocyte
  preparations, for selected components and targets of the PLC/IP3 pathway. (a) glycogen
  phosphorylase (GPase) activity and intracellular calcium levels (Ca2+i); (b) fructose‐1,6‐bisphosphatase
  (F‐1,6‐BP) activity and phosphorylation; (c) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK)
  activity and gluconeogenesis; and (d) activities of pyruvate kinase (PyrK) and glycogen
  synthase (GS). The shaded vertical bars represent the statistical range of plasma
  glucagon concentrations in the hepatic portal system (see legends of Figures  and
  ). At the upper limit, mediated exclusively by the PLC/IP3 pathway, glucagon increased
  Ca2+i 68% and GPase activity 93% (a), F‐1,6‐BPase activity 87% and its phosphorylation
  53% (b), and PEPCK expression (activity) 94% and gluconeogenesis 57% (c) of the
  maximum response produced by higher concentrations. It also decreased PyrK activity
  by 37% and GS activity by 19% (d). Effects produced by concentrations above 100 pM
  are mediated by the activation of both the PLC/IP3 and AC/cAMP pathways simultaneously.
  The data are adapted from Aggarwal et al. (), Ekdahl and Ekman (), Fleig et al.
  (), Marks and Parker Botelho, () and Staddon and Hansford (). See also El‐Maghrabi
  et al. (), Felíu et al. (), Ikezawa et al. () and Studer et al. (). The data are
  consistent with the hypothesis that glucagon, at physiological concentrations, exerts
  substantial effects on intracellular targets involved in glucose mobilization by
  activating the PLC/IP3 pathway without activating the AC/cAMP pathway
