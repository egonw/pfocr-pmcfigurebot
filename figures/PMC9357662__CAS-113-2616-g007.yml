caption: 'Association between H1.0, GCN5, and AR in transcriptional activation of
  Txr genes. (A) H1.0 knockdown significantly reduces H3Ac and AR expression, which
  were notably restored by GCN5 overexpression in paclitaxel‐resistant cells. (B)
  GCN5 overexpression rescues ABCB1 promoter (ABCB1Pr) activity in H1.0‐knockdown
  SKOV3/Txr and 2774/Txr cells. Each assay was normalized against Renilla luciferase
  activity. (C) AR‐binding affinity on ABCB1 and ABCG2 promoters was diminished by
  H1.0 knockdown while binding capacity was restored by GCN5 overexpression as shown
  by ChIP assays. PCR reactions of exons 8 and 16 were negative control for ABCB1
  and ABCG2 genes, respectively. (D) Schematic diagram illustrating the role of H1.0
  upregulation in paclitaxel‐resistant ovarian cancer cells. Activation of the PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathway enhances H1.0 expression, which cooperates with GCN5, recruiting
  the transcription factor AR and inducing the expression of the drug resistance genes
  ABCB1 and ABCG2, thereby enhancing cell viability and drug resistance. ARE: AR‐binding
  element. Experiments were performed independently in triplicate (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001)'
