caption: Gene expression mapped on the Nrf2 pathway (Wikipathways ID = 4357), cardiac
  structure and function. (A) Binding with Keap1/Cul3/RBX1 complex allows Nrf2 protein
  to be continually degraded via ubiquitination/proteosomal degradation. In response
  to ROS, Keap1 is oxidized or Nrf2 is phosphorylated resulting in translocation to
  nucleus. Pathway diagram shows changes in mNrf2-TG ARE targets when activated. Colour
  gradient scaled from blue (negative fold change) to red (positive fold change) was
  calculated using Log2foldchange, scaled and mapped onto curated network. Nodes (rectangle)
  represent genes or proteins and edges (or lines) represent interactions and relationships
  between connected nodes. (B) Validation of protein expression using Western blot,
  confirming the summary of changes in network. (C) Cardiac structure and function
  in mNrf2-TG mice. Two-dimensional non-invasive echocardiography (PSLAX axis) was
  used to determine systolic functions (i.e., ejection fraction and cardiac output),
  Left ventricle dimensions (i.e., LV mass, intraventricular septum diameter-systole
  and diastole) and diastolic function, i.e., mitral valve (early, E to late, A ratio)
  filling (n = 6â€“8/group).
