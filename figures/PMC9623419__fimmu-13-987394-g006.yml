caption: The analysis of EPSTI1 expression at the single cell level. (A, B) EPSTI1
  expression levels in various cell types revealed by dimensional reduction plots
  (left and middle panels) and dot plots (right panels). The results show that EPSTI1
  is mainly expressed in immune cells, especially in macrophages and dendritic cells.
  Epi, epithelial cells; Strom, stromal cells; B, B cells; Granulo, granulocytes;
  Mast, mast cells; NK, natural killer cells; TCD4, CD4 positive T cells; TCD8, CD8
  positive T cells; DC, dendritic cells; Macro, macrophages; Mono, monocytes; Plasma,
  plasma cells. (C) The EPSTI1+ macrophage ratio and M1 macrophage ratio are significantly
  correlated (R = 0.406, P = 0.021) (D, E) The module scores of gene signatures related
  to M1/M2 polarization in EPSTI1+/- macrophages suggest that EPSTI1+ macrophages
  have more M1 features. (F) Mean pathway activity scores of EPSTI1+/- macrophages.
  The immune-related pathways appear to be more active in EPSTI1+ macrophages. (G)
  Mean pathway activity scores of EPSTI1+/- DCs. Immune-related pathways are scored
  higher in EPSTI1+ DCs. (H, I) Macrophages and DCs are significantly correlated (R
  > 0.60, P < 0.001) in terms of EPSTI1 expression levels and the proportion of EPSTI1
  positive cells.
