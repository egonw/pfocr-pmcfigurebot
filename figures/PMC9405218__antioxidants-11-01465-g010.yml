caption: 'Effect of ICS II on SIRT3-KO mice: (a) cardiac function was measured using
  Doppler echocardiography; (b) EF (%) (n = 6); (c) FS (%) (n = 6); (d) HE staining
  was performed to observe the pathological changes in the left ventricle. Magnification
  ×400; scale bar, 50 μm; (e) myocardial infarct size was performed by TTC staining;
  (f) quantitative data of myocardial infarct size (%) (n = 5). The data are presented
  as the mean ± SEM. ## p < 0.01 vs. sham (WT); ** p < 0.01 vs. MI (WT); $$ p < 0.01
  vs. sham (SIRT3-KO); @@ p < 0.01 vs. MI (SIRT3-KO); && p < 0.01 vs. ICS II + MI
  (WT).'
