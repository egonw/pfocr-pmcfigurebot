caption: Pep2-8 treatment and protein changes in the aortic arch of WT 24-month-old
  mice injected with Pep2-8 vs saline every two weeks for 10 weeks. (A-B) 60 representative
  proteins downregulated or upregulated by Pep2-8 in aged WT mice based on activation
  z-score. (C) Pep2-8 treatment regulates inflammatory cytokines or chemokines based
  on activation score in the aortic arch of 24-month-old mice. (D) Canonical pathways
  based on a -log(p-value) greater than 1.5 and an absolute value z-score greater
  than 2.0. Color by z-score. Blue signifies negative value; orange signifies positive
  value; and grey signifies no activity pattern. Size is proportional to the number
  of genes that overlap the pathway. (E) Graphical summary for the signaling pathways.
  Orange and blue indicate activation and inhibition, respectively. Gray dashed lines
  depict no prediction. (F) Schematic cartoon for the relationship between PCSK9-mediated
  defective efferocytosis and vascular aging. This figure was created with Biorender.com.
