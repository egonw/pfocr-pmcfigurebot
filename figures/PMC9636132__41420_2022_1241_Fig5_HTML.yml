figure_title: H2O2 promotes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by repressing USP22-FASN
  pathway in p53+/+ CRC cells
caption: A RKO and HCT116 cells stably expressing USP22 or FASN were treated with
  H2O2, and cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting using the indicated antibodies.
  B RKO and HCT116 cells expressing USP22 or FASN were treated with H2O2, and then
  double stained with Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI). Cell apoptosis was analyzed
  by flow cytometry. C CRC tissues with wild-type p53 were labeled by Tunel (Green)
  and anti-8-Oxoguanine antibody (Red), and images were taken using a Zeiss confocal
  microscope. Representative images of two tumors are shown. Scale bar, 200 Î¼m. The
  percentages of 8-OxoG and Tunel positive cells in each microscope field were analyzed
  and compared (4 randomly selected fields for each tissue, 6 tissues, Pearson correlation
  test).
