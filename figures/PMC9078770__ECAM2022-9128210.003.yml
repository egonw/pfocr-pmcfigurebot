caption: LrB alleviated MI/R-induced myocardial fibrosis in mice. (a) Representative
  images of the cardiac tissues after Masson's trichrome staining and the percentage
  of fibrosis were analyzed. Scar bar = 100 μm. (b) Western blot analysis for fibronectin,
  collagen I, collagen III, and α-SMA in the cardiac tissues. Relative protein expression
  of (c) fibronectin, (d) collagen I, (e) collagen III, and (f) α-SMA. Values are
  expressed as mean ± SD (n = 6). +++p < 0.001vs. sham group. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗∗p < 0.001vs.
  MI/R group.
