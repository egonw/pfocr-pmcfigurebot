caption: ALP is a direct target of miR-9-5p. Left 293T cells were transfected with
  miR-9-5p, or mimic control and then with the indicated ALP 3′UTR reporter or an
  empty vector and a Renilla luciferase control vector. The firefly luciferase activity
  was measured after 48 h and was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity and to
  the empty vector. Right showed the potential binding site of ALP 3′UTR reporter
  and miR-9-5p. **p < 0.01 vs WT-ALP group.
