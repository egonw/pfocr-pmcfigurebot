caption: Pathway-associated metabolite set enrichment analysis (MSEA) for TPS vs.
  MPS. (A) Plot showing affected biological processes in transgenerationally stressed
  (TPS) compared to multigenerationally stressed (MPS) rats, based on metabolites
  identified as significantly altered between these groups. The p-value for each pathway
  is shown using the heatmap on the right of the figure and the fold enrichment shows
  how many times greater than chance the process is involved. (B) Metabolomic pathway
  analysis showing all matched pathways according to p-values from pathway enrichment
  analysis and pathway impact values from pathway topology analysis in TPS vs. MPS
  rats. The y-axis shows the negative natural log of p, such that a higher value on
  the y-axis gives a lower p-value. The x-axis indicates the pathway impact, which
  correlates to the number of metabolite hits in a particular pathway. Only metabolic
  pathways with p < 0.05 are labeled. The largest difference in pathway activity between
  TPS and MPS was observed in the glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism.
