caption: H3K56ac regulates the expression of FUN30, SNF2, TEL1, and MEC1. (A). Expression
  of RTT109, FUN30, SNF2, TEL1, and MEC1 was analyzed in BWP17-URA3, RTT109D-URA3,
  RTT109D/RTT109OE-URA3, and RTT109D/FUN30OE-URA3 using qPCR. (B). Expression of RTT109,
  FUN30, SNF2, TEL1, and MEC1 was analyzed in FUN30myc and RTT109D strains using qPCR.
  This data is presented as average ± s.e.m. of three technical replicates. (C). Expression
  of H3K56ac was analyzed by western blot in BWP17-URA3, RTT109D-URA3, RTT109D/RTT109OE-URA3
  strains. H3 was used as the internal control. (D). Expression of Fun30myc was analyzed
  by western blot FUN30myc and RTT109D strains. G6PDH was used as the internal control.
  (E). Occupancy of H3K56ac on FUN30, SNF2, TEL1, and MEC1 promoters was analyzed
  using ChIP in BWP17-URA3, RTT109D-URA3, RTT109D/RTT109OE-URA3 strains. (F). Occupancy
  of Fun30myc on RTT109, FUN30, SNF2, TEL1, and MEC1 promoters was analyzed using
  ChIP in FUN30myc and RTT109D strains. (G). Expression of VPS75, RTT109, FUN30, SNF2,
  TEL1 and MEC1 was analyzed in BWP17-URA3 and VPS75Hz-URA3 strains by qPCR. Unless
  stated otherwise, the qPCR and ChIP data are presented as average ± s.e.m. of three
  biological replicates. * p < 0.05. The western blots were repeated for three biological
  replicates and one representative image is shown.
