caption: miRNA-320 inhibits cell migration and invasion. (A,B) Representative images
  of the wound healing assay revealed that ectopic expression of miRNA-320 inhibited
  cell migration in HT29 and SW480 cells (A), while downregulation of miRNA-320 promoted
  cell migration in HCT116 and DLD1 cells (B). Observe and take pictures under an
  inverted microscope. Magnification, 40×. The width of black dashed lines indicates
  the initial wound area. The width of red dashed lines indicates the wound area after
  48 hours (C,D) Representative images of the transwell assay (stained with 0.1% crystal
  violet) revealed that ectopic expression of miRNA-320 inhibited cell invasion of
  HT29 and SW480 cells (C), while downregulation of miRNA-320 promoted cell invasion
  of HCT116 and DLD1 cells (D). Magnification, 40×. Data are expressed as the mean
  ± SD. ***, P<0.001. LV, lentiviral vector; miRNA, microRNA; SD, standard deviation.
