caption: Immunolabeling of PrPSc in the olfactory pathway of white-tailed deer inoculated
  with raccoon CWD. (A) The layers of the olfactory bulb from rostral to caudal (top
  of image to bottom) are the olfactory nerve cell layer (ONL), the glomerular layer
  (GL), the external plexiform layer (EPL), the mitral cell layer (MCL), and the granule
  cell layer (GCL). Spongiform change is present in the EPL and less notably in the
  granule cell layer. (B) Immunolabeling for PrPSc (red) is strongest in the EPL and
  GCL. (C,D) The optic tract at the level of the basal nuclei has dense accumulation
  of PrPSc (red). (E,F) A higher magnification of the area outlined by the rectangle
  in (C). (E) There is severe spongiform change in the piriform cortex. (F) There
  are coalescing granular and plaque-like aggregates of PrPSc in the olfactory tract
  (red). (A,C,E) Hematoxylin and eosin. (B,D,F) Immunohistochemistry, F99 monoclonal
  antibody. Original magnification (A–D) 20×; (E,F) 100×.
