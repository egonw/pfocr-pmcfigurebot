caption: ISGs restrict viral neuroinvasion. (A) ISGs in BMECs, which constitute the
  blood-brain barrier (BBB), are activated by virus and inflammation, leading to an
  IFN response and activation of transcription of antiviral ISGs, followed by activation
  of microglia and astrocytes to release ISGs. BMECs deliver the released ISGs to
  macrophages to enhance the antiviral response and restrict viral invasion. ① Neurotropic
  virus crosses the BBB through “Trojan horse” strategy. ② Virus infects endothelial
  cells across the BBB. ③ Virus enters the CNS by destroying the BBB. (B) The virus
  invades the CNS retrogradely through the olfactory pathway. The virus invades the
  olfactory sensory neurons through the olfactory epithelium and retrogrades upward
  into the olfactory bulb (OB). Virus at OB activates neurons, microglia, and macrophages,
  which produces IFN response and induces transcription of ISGs, leading to antiviral
  response. Long-distance signaling of IFN at the OB activates the transcription of
  ISGs in the brain. (C) IFNs produced by peripheral antiviral response enter the
  CNS and activate the transcription of ISGs in advance and induces transcription
  of ISGs, leading to antiviral response. Long-distance signaling of IFN at the OB
  activates the transcription of ISGs in the brain. (C) IFNs produced by peripheral
  antiviral response enter the CNS and activate the transcription of ISGs in advance.
