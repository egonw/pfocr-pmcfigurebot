caption: Heatmap showing the results of the sample-level enrichment analysis (SLEA).
  (aâ€“e) Heatmaps for upregulated and downregulated pathways and genes in the bacterial
  citrate cycle (TCA cycle) pathway/the nitrogen metabolism pathway and the chemotaxis
  pathway, respectively. The number in squares represents the log2-fold change in
  the gene of the MDR plasmid transconjugant compared with J53. Upregulated genes
  are colored in red and downregulated genes are colored in green. The color scale
  is shown at the bottom right.
