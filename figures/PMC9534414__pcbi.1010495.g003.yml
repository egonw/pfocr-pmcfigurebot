figure_title: Monocyte and neutrophil interaction in COVID-19 patients
caption: 'A. Heatmap of the pathway-specific cell-cell interaction (pCCI) contribution
  in monocytes as ligands and neutrophils as receptors in the Chua dataset, where
  the rows indicate the signaling pathways and columns indicate the samples. The signaling
  pathways are clustered into 6 groups. B. Dot plot indicating the cell-cell interaction
  contribution (pathway-cluster cell-cell interaction) in monocyte subgroups as ligands
  and neutrophils as receptors of the pathway-cluster 2 (upper panel) and pathway-cluster
  4 (lower panel) as defined in (A). The columns indicate the 5 cellular subtypes
  of monocytes as ligands and the rows indicate the signaling pathways. A larger dot
  represents a higher level of cell-cell interaction. C. Bar plot indicating the log-ratio
  of cell-cell interaction contributions between two time points (y-axis) for longitudinal
  samples of 4 patients (2 moderate: BIH-CoV-12, BIH-CoV-15; 2 severe: BIH-CoV-06,
  BIH-CoV-07) in monocytes as ligands and neutrophils as receptors. The x-axis represents
  the signaling pathways. D. Heatmap of the cell-cell interaction contribution in
  monocytes as ligands and neutrophils as receptors for two patients (C143 and C146)
  in the Liao dataset that have more than 20 neutrophils, where the rows indicate
  the signaling pathways and columns indicate the samples. The signaling pathways
  are highlighted by the 6 signaling pathway clusters from (A).'
