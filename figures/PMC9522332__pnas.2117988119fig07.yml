caption: TGFB2-AS1 reverses breast cancer cell stemness. (A) GSEA of microarray profiles
  from MDA-231 with TGFB2-AS1 knockdown matching with stem cell activated gene set.
  (B) Heat-map representation of up-regulated genes relating mammalian embryonic stem
  cell pluripotency from IPA pathway analysis in TGFB2-AS1 knockdown group and control
  group. The orange color scales represent up-regulated genes, and the blue color
  scales represent down-regulated genes. (C) Schematic view of SMARCA4 occupancy on
  locus of SOX2 from ChIP-seq in MDA-231 cells with TGFB2-AS1 knockdown. Blue indicates
  siNC group and pink indicates siB2-AS1 group. H3K4Me3 and H3K27Ac histone mark were
  displayed on seven cell lines from ENCODE, on the layered H3K4Me3 and the layered
  H3K27Ac tracks respectively. Each color represents one cell line. (D) ChIP-qPCR
  shows the binding efficiency of SMARCA4 to the SOX2 using primer in MDA-231 cells
  with TGFB2-AS1 knockdown. The red arrow indicates the target fragment. (E and F)
  ChIP-qPCR shows the H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac efficient occupancy on the SOX2 promoter
  region in MDA-231 cells with TGFB2-AS1 knockdown. The mRNA and protein expression
  of SOX2 and NANOG in MDA-231 cells after transfected with siAS1 in (G) LM2 cells
  overexpressed TGFB2-AS1 in (H) and in MDA-231 cells and LM2 cells (I). Error bars
  represent mean ± SD (n = 3). Statistical significance was assessed using 2-tailed
  Student’s t test. *P < 0.05. **P < 0.01. ***P < 0.001.
