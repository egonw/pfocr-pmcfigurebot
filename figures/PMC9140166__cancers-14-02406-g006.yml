caption: 'Ligustilide attenuated the signaling pathway involved in the proliferation
  of HUVECs induced by CAF supernatant. Ligustilide-treated (0, 10, 20 or 40 Î¼M) CAF
  supernatant suppressed the upregulation of AKT, p38, ERK, AP-1, VEGFA and MMP9 induced
  by CAF supernatant at the mRNA level in HUVECs (A). Ligustilide-treated CAF supernatant
  had no effect on DLL4, FOXC2 or Notch1 compared with CAF supernatant at the mRNA
  level in HUVECs (B). Ligustilide-treated CAF supernatants decreased p-AKT, AKT,
  p-ERK, ERK, p-p38, p38 and AP1 protein levels induced by CAF supernatant (C). Control
  represents HUVECs treated with PBS. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001, ns:
  not significant. The original blots could be found in .'
