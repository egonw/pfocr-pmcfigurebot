caption: 'IVM inhibited the migration of cancer cells in vitro. Wound healing assay
  and transwell migration assay of the breast cancer MCF-7 cells (A) and MDA-MB-231
  cells (B), and colorectal cancer HCT-8 cells (C) and HCT-116 cells (D). Measurement:
  0, 24, and 48 h after IVM treatment, respectively. Concentrations of IVM was as
  indicated. Top panel: quantitation of wound closure: ([distance of the wound at
  0 h - distance of the wound at 24 h]/distance of the wound at 0 h × 100%). Left
  bottom panel: quantitation of transwell migration assay. Scale bar = 250 μm. Cells
  treated with vehicle served as control. Data in the histograms were presented as
  the mean ± SD (n = 3). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, compared with their respective controls.'
