caption: 'Knocking down the expression of TAZ reduces the postponing effect of ADSCs
  on SS. (A) shRNA lentivirus vector targeting TAZ was injected into tail vein of
  NOD mice (with ADSCs treated). (B) The expression of TAZ decreased after lentivirus
  transfection in SMGs in mice. *P<0.05, #P<0.05 vs. sh-NC. (C) Knocking down TAZ
  reduced the delaying effect of ADSCs on SS, but this effect is still stronger than
  the PBS-treated Control group. *P<0.05; #P<0.05. ADSCs, adipose-derived stem cells;
  NOD, non-obese diabetic; sh, short hairpin RNA; SMG, submandibular gland; SS, Sjögren''s
  syndrome; TAZ, transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif.'
