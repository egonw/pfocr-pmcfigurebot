figure_title: Mutant Gαs-Coupled Receptors, Gαs-Dependent Signaling, and the GNAS
  Locus
caption: Panel A shows examples of G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) and the diseases
  caused by variants in the genes encoding these receptors. AVPR2 denotes arginine
  vasopressin receptor 2, GHRH growth hormone–releasing hormone, LHCGR luteinizing
  hormone–chorionic gonadotropin receptor, MC4R melanocortin 4 receptor, PHP1B pseudohypoparathyroidism
  type 1b, and PTH parathyroid hormone. Panel B shows the signaling pathway of the
  GPCR, including the trimeric stimulatory G-protein complex that includes the alpha
  subunit (Gαs). The abbreviation cAMP denotes cyclic AMP, PDE phosphodiesterase,
  and PKA protein kinase A. Panel C shows how the GNAS locus gives rise to several
  imprinted sense and antisense (AS) transcripts, including Gαs, which is encoded
  by exons 1 through 13. This transcript is mostly biallelically expressed, except
  for a few tissues and cells in which paternal Gαs expression is partially or completely
  silenced (gray arrow). With the use of alternative first exons and promoters, namely
  XL and A/B, which splice onto exons 2 through 13, the GNAS locus also gives rise
  to the extra-large XLαs protein and the A/B transcript; the latter is either nontranslated
  or encodes an N-terminally truncated form of Gαs. In addition, exon NESP, encoding
  a neuroendocrine secretory peptide, splices onto exons 2 through 13, although translation
  does not extend beyond the termination codon (indicated by the pound sign) at the
  3′ end of NESP. An AS transcript is derived from the paternal GNAS allele. Several
  differentially methylated regions (DMRs) within the alternative first exons of GNAS
  undergo parent-specific methylation (asterisks), thus restricting transcription
  and the resulting GNAS-derived messenger RNAs to either the maternal allele (NESP)
  or the paternal allele (A/B, XL, and AS). The promoter driving expression of Gαs
  does not undergo parent-specific methylation. Mutations involving any of the 13
  Gαs exons cause Albright’s hereditary osteodystrophy with or without hormone resistance,
  depending on the parental GNAS allele on which the mutation occurs. Occurrence on
  the maternal allele results in pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a (PHP1A), and occurrence
  on the paternal allele results in pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism (PPHP). Deletions,
  duplications, or an inversion on the maternal allele involving STX16 (the gene encoding
  syntaxin 16) or GNAS that are associated with loss of methylation at one or all
  three maternal DMRs (red Xs) result in silencing of maternal Gαs expression (gray
  arrow) and PHP1B. Red arrows indicate expression from the maternal allele only,
  and blue arrows expression from the paternal allele only.
