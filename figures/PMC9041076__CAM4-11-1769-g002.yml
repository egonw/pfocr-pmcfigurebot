caption: Influence of TP53 inactivation on chromosomal instability and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathway. (A) The TP53 inactivation score was highly correlated with the CIN signature
  (p < 0.001, rho value = 0.902, Spearman's correlation). (B) The CIN signature was
  increased in HCV‐SVR‐DAA tumors compared with HCV‐SVR‐IFN tumors. (C) Volcano plot
  showing the results of microarray analysis in HCV‐SVR‐DAA tumors and HCV‐SVR‐IFN
  tumors. (D) SKP2 was identified as being especially overexpressed in HCV‐SVR‐DAA
  tumors. (E) Analysis of the correlation between the PI3K/mTOR CMAP UP signature
  and the TP53 inactivation score showed a significant positive correlation (p < 0.001,
  rho value = 0.695, Spearman's correlation). (F) Clustering analysis of the expression
  of 134 genes in the PI3K/mTOR CMAP UP signature. (g) The PI3K/mTOR CMAP UP signature
  was significantly enhanced in HCV‐SVR‐DAA tumors (p = 0.018)
