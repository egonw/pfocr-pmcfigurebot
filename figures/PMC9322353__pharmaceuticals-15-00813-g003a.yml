caption: 'Effects of LPS on TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway activation and SREBP-2
  expression in HepG2 cells. Cells were treated with LPS (1 μg/mL) for 0 min, 10 min,
  30 min, 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, or 48 h. The total protein levels of TLR4 (A),
  MyD88 (B), TNF-α (D), SREBP-2 precursor (pre-SREBP-2) (E), SREBP-2 mature forms
  (N-SREBP-2) (F), and p65 phosphorylation (C) were measured by Western blotting.
  The nuclear protein levels of p65 (G) and N-SREBP-2 (H) were detected by Western
  blotting. The results are presented as means ± SD of three independent experiments;
  *: p < 0.05 vs. 0 min; **: p < 0.01 vs. 0 min.'
