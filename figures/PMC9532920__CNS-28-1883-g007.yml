caption: Apigenin inhibits fibrosis expression induced by TGFβ in NIH‐3 T3 cells.
  (A) The expression of Fn and α‐SMA in NIH‐3 T3 cells incubated with DMSO or apigenin
  for 24 h in the presence or absence of TGFβ was detected by Western blotting and
  (B, C) quantitative analysis. (D)The expression of α‐SMA, with or without TGFβ stimulation
  and incubation with DMSO or apigenin for 24 h, was detected by immunofluorescence
  (Scale bar = 12.5 μm). (* means p < 0.05; ** means p < 0.01, p values were calculated
  with one‐way anova, followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. n = 3)
