figure_title: Transcription factor Ets-1 expression is induced in soraR cells
caption: 'A Total RNA extracted from Hep3B-naive and soraR cells was subjected to
  cDNA synthesis and analyzed with human transcription factors PCR Array (PAHS-075Z).
  Figure in A shows the heat map with the upregulated genes marked in red and the
  downregulated genes marked in green. B shows the scatter plot of expression levels
  of 84 genes. Red dots indicate genes upregulated and the green dots indicate the
  genes downregulated. The central line indicates genes that were unchanged (black
  dots) with dotted lines indicating the selected twofold regulation cut-of. C Changes
  in the expression of ETS-1 gene in Huh7 and Hep3B (naive and soraR) cells were analyzed
  by qPCR. The data represent the mean ± S.D. of 3 independent PCR reactions, and
  the experiment was repeated three times. D Equal amounts of total protein from 3
  sets of naive (N) and soraR (SR) HCC cells were analyzed by western blots with antibodies
  against Ets-1 and GAPDH. E Immunocytochemistry showing differences in expression
  of Ets-1 in naive and soraR cells. The images were captured using the NIS-Elements
  imaging software in Nikon Eclipse Ti Microscope. Scale bar, 20 µm. F Representative
  images of immunohistochemistry of Ets-1 using liver cancer tissue microarray (US
  Biomax, # T031b). Scale bar, 60 µm. The Ets-1 staining intensities in the TMA were
  scored and plotted to the right. Statistical significance was determined by Tukey’s
  multiple comparisons test. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001,
  ns: p > 0.05 not significant. HCC-CC hepatocholangiocarcinoma.'
