caption: 'Direct and indirect effects for the proposed Serial Multiple Mediation Model.
  Notes: The variables used in the mediation model were the following: X = Independent
  Variable: breast cancer; Y = Dependent Variable: depression; M1 =Mediator 1: emotional
  attention; M2 = Mediator 2: emotional clarity; M3 = Mediator 3: emotional repair;
  Covariate = age. Effects: a2 = Direct effect of BC on EC; a3 = Direct effect of
  BC on ER; b1 = Direct effect of EA on depression; b3 = Direct effect of ER on depression;
  d21 = Direct effect of EA on EC; d32 = Direct effect of EC on ER; eM1 = Direct effect
  of Age on EA; c′ = Direct effect of BC on depression; c = Total effect of BC on
  depression; R2 = R square. * = p < 0.05; ** = p < 0.01; *** = p < 0.001.  Direct
  effects.  Indirect Pathway 3 (a1b1) = Indirect effect of BC on depression through
  ER only.  Indirect Pathway 6 (a2d32b3) = Indirect effect of BC on depression through
  EC and ER in serial.'
