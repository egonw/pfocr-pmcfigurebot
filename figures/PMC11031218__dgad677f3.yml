caption: Identification of predictive markers for exercise intervention success. A,
  The circle plot shows the significantly enriched pathways among genes differentially
  expressed between low responders (LRE) and high responders (RES) at w0, including
  genes allocated to each pathway. Shown are logarithmic fold changes (logFC) (downregulated
  and upregulated in RES indicated in blue and pink, respectively) and z scores (from
  blue to red, summarizing decrease and increase in gene expression, respectively).
  B, Venn diagram depicts the proportion of differentially expressed genes (DEG) at
  baseline that are significantly altered in response to exercise training in LRE
  and RES. Top 20 genes predictive of Matsuda index FC as identified by LASSO regression
  are shown. C, The y-axis indicates the gene symbols and the x-axis the percentage
  of successful models which identified the gene as a predictive marker. Box plots
  display the expression levels of predictive markers identified with LASSO in LRE
  and RES. D, P values were determined using limma t test (*P < .05, **P < .01, ****P
  < .0001).
