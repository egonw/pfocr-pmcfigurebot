caption: NF-κB signalling promoting the apoptosis and cell cycle of glioblastoma is
  mostly independent of EZH2. a Heatmap of candidate genes was only regulated by NF-κB.
  b RT-qPCR detects the mRNA levels of genes relative to apoptosis and cell cycle
  in WT and EZH2 KO LN229 cells treated with LPS. c, d Cell cycle and apoptosis assays
  in the LN229 cell line of WT, p65 KO, p65 KO with p65 ectopic overexpression and
  p65 KO with EZH2 ectopic overexpression groups or WT, EZH2 KO, EZH2 KO with EZH2
  ectopic overexpression and EZH2 KO with p65 ectopic overexpression groups. e, f
  Cell cycle and apoptosis assays in WT, EZH2 KO and EZH2 KO with EZH2 ectopic overexpression
  LN229 cells treated with PBS or LPS. Values are expressed as the means±SD from three
  experiments, and the asterisk indicates the statistical significance compared to
  the controls (*, p < 0.05, **, p < 0.01, ***, p < 0.001, ****, p < 0.0001).
