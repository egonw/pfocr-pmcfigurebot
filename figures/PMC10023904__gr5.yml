caption: AS signature search workflow. A) Transcriptome signature retrieval from cancer
  type and pathway selection of interest (Step1). Splicing browser presents an exon
  usage heatmap (Step 2) and clinical information for each selected AS event (Step
  3). B) Knowledge-based signature was provided for the corresponding pathway. C)
  Multi-omics sequence profile of AS event can be browsed in table contents and UCSC
  genome browser (Step 4).
