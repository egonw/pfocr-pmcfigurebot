caption: Identification and functional analysis of DE-circRNAs. (a) Heatmap of DE-circRNA
  expression in PCE and NCE. (b) Volcano plots of DE-circRNA expression in PCE and
  NCE. Blue dots indicate downregulated DE-circRNAs, and yellow dots indicate upregulated
  DE-circRNAs. (c) Main enriched BP, CC, and MF GO terms of DE-circRNAs. The lengths
  of the columns indicate the -log10(P) of input DE-circRNAs in GO terms. The number
  following the columns indicates the quantities of input DE-circRNAs in each GO term.
  The ratios of blue/red columns indicate the relative quantities of decreased DE-circRNAs
  vs. increased DE-circRNAs in each GO term. (d) The top 6 significantly enriched
  KEGG pathways of upregulated and downregulated DE-circRNAs. The lengths of the columns
  indicate the -log10(P) of input DE-circRNAs in KEGG pathways. The number following
  the columns indicates the quantities of input DE-circRNAs in each KEGG pathway.
  The ratios of blue/red columns indicate the relative quantities of decreased DE-circRNAs
  vs. increased DE-circRNAs input in each pathway.
