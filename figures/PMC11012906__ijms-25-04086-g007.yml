caption: 'Effect of silencing miR-21 on migration of CaSki cells. Cellular migration
  was evaluated by a wound healing assay. The microscopy images were captured at 0
  h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h after the stria was made. The migration of CaSki cells was
  significantly reduced at 24 h after transfection with siRNAs to miR-21. Panel (A):
  Microscopy images of CaSki cell migration non-transfected (NT, lanes a–d and aa–ad)
  or transfected with pSilencer 1.0-U6 empty vector plasmid (lanes e–l) or pSIMIR21-5P
  plasmid, respectively (lanes ae–al). Panel (B): Analysis of CaSki cell migration
  non-transfected or transfected with pSilencer 1.0-U6 or pSIMIR21-5P plasmids. The
  data are expressed in averages + SE. p values < 0.05 are indicated with an asterisk.
  Following transfection, cells were observed in a Nikon Elipse Ts2 microscopy, and
  samples were analyzed using the 40× phase contrast objective.'
