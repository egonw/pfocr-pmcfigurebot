caption: 'Single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐Seq) analysis of the migrated cell population
  from the rat spinal cord slice into decellularised spinal cord matrix (DSCM)/COLI
  cultured conditions reveals increased proportion of matured neural progenitor cells
  (NPCs) subtype. (A) The workflow shows the collection and processing of migrated
  cell from a rat spinal cord organotypic for scRNA‐seq (Created in BioRender.com).
  (B) Cryo‐SEM image of COLI and DSCM hydrogel (Bar = 3 μm). (C) Immunofluorescence
  staining (Nestin, SOX2, and TUJ1) of the cells that migrated from the spinal cord
  organotypic. (Scale Bar: 100 μm; Scale Bar: 50 μm for 3D; SP marks the position
  of spinal cord slice). (D) UMAP plot shows all cell types of migrated cells from
  a rat spinal cord organotypic under DSCM and COLI condition. (E) The relative proportion
  of each migrated cell type. **adjusted p‐value (adj. p) < 0.01; ns (no significance).
  The exact adj. p and cell number are shown in Figure . (F) Heatmap shows the scaled
  gene expression of common NPC markers in each NPC sub‐populations. (G) Cell proportion
  of NPC subtypes. The exact adj. p and cell numbers (n) are shown on the graph (hypergeometric
  tests and Benjamini‐Hochberg correction). (H) Heatmap shows pseudotime rank and
  scaled gene expression of each NPC sub‐populations. The significantly enriched GO
  terms and gene names based on the top 50 high‐expression genes are pictured right.
  ASC, astrocytes; ECs, endothelial cells.'
