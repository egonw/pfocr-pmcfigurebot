caption: 'TIPE2 inhibits autophagy levels in H9c2 cells. (A) Levels of autophagy were
  measured using a tandem sensor. OGD increased autophagy levels in H9c2 cells, while
  the overexpression of TIPE2 reduced autophagy levels in H9c2 cells with/without
  OGD. (B) Western blotting was used to analyze the proteins expression levels of
  autophagy-related LC3B and ATG14 in H9c2 cells. Data are representative of three
  independent repeats per experiment. &P>0.05 vs. plasmid; *P<0.05, ***P<0.001 vs.
  plasmid; #P<0.001 vs. plasmid + OGD. TIPE2, TNF-Î±-induced protein 8-like protein
  2; OGD, oxygen glucose deprivation; over-, overexpression; ATG14, autophagy related
  14.'
