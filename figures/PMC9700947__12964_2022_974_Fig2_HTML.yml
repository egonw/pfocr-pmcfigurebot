caption: 'RRP9 overexpression promotes chemoresistance to gemcitabine in PC cells.
  A RRP9 mRNA levels in control cells and RRP-9-overexpressing (RRP9-OE) cells. Data
  are given as mean ± SD, n = 3. B RRP9 protein levels in control cells and RRP-9-overexpressing
  (RRP9-OE) cells. Data are expressed by mean ± SD, n = 3. C Cell viability was assessed
  in control and RRP9-overexpressing cells treated with increasing concentrations
  of gemcitabine. Data are given as mean ± SD, n = 50 μM. IC50 of gemcitabine in the
  indicated cells. D Colony formation was measured in control and RRP9-overexpressing
  cells treated with vehicle or gemcitabine (50 μM). Representative colony formation
  images (left) and quantification (right) are shown. Data are presented as mean ± SD,
  n = 3. E Apoptosis was measured in control and RRP9-overexpressing cells treated
  with vehicle or gemcitabine (50 μM). FACS analysis (left) and quantification (right)
  are given. Data are expressed by mean ± SD, n = 3. Note: **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001,
  ****p < 0.0001'
