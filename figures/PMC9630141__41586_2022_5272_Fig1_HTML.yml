figure_title: TGFβR2 signalling in DPT+ universal fibroblasts drives LRRC15+ myofibroblast
  differentiation
caption: a, Schematic of the genetic (top) and experimental (bottom) approach for
  the generation of DptIresCreERT2Tgfbr2fl/fl mice. s.c., subcutaneous. b–g, Data
  are from subcutaneous KPR tumours 21 days after implantation in Dptwt/wtTgfbr2fl/fl
  and Dptki/kiTgfbr2fl/fl mice. b, Representative flow cytometry plots showing the
  frequency of PDPN+LRRC15+ cells. Cells were gated on PDPN+CD31– cells. c,d, Quantification
  of the total number of PDPN+LRRC15+ cells (c) and PDPN+CD31– cells (d) normalized
  by tumour weight (n = 12 mice). e, Uniform manifold approximation and projection
  (UMAP) plot of 6,525 single fibroblasts coloured by cluster membership (left, n = 5
  mice per group) and the relative average expression of indicated marker genes in
  clusters (C0–C5) from the UMAP (right). f, UMAP as in e split by genotype. g, UMAP
  as in e split by genotype and coloured by expression of Lrrc15. h–j, Data are from
  orthotopic pancreatic KPR tumours 15 days after implantation in Dptwt/wtTgfbr2fl/fl
  or Dptki/kiTgfbr2fl/fl mice h, Representative flow cytometry plots showing the frequency
  of PDPN+LRRC15+ cells. Cells were gated on PDPN+CD31– cells. i,j, Quantification
  of the total number of PDPN+LRRC15+ cells (i) and PDPN+CD31– cells (j) normalized
  by tumour weight (n = 11 or 14 mice). k, Scheme of collection of the human samples.
  NAT, normal adjacent tissue; BLAD, bladder urothelial carcinoma; GYN, gynaecologic
  tumours; PDAC, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma; HNSC, head and neck squamous cell
  carcinoma; SRC, sarcoma; KID, kidney cancer; HEP, liver hepatocellular carcinoma;
  CRC, colorectal cancer; LUNG, lung cancer; MEL, melanoma; ADR, adrenal cancer; PNET,
  pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour; GALL, gallbladder cancer. l, PCA of stromal cell
  samples. Shapes indicate the sample origin; colours represent the cancer indication.
  m, Gene loadings for PC1 from l. n, Distribution of samples from specified indications
  across PC1 from l. o, Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC) between LRRC15 expression
  and TGFβ pathway activity across samples (filled circles). Linear regression line
  (dashed line). p, Forest plot depicting TGFβ CAF overall survival hazard ratios
  (HRs) across specified TCGA indications. Data in c, d, i and j are the mean ± s.d.
  Data in c, d, i and j are pooled from two or three independent experiments. For
  n, whiskers represent the minimum and maximum, the box represents the interquartile
  range, and the centre line represents the median. For p, the centre point shows
  the HR, lines represent 95% confidence interval (CI). Statistics were calculated
  using two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t-test (c,d,i,j) or Cox proportional hazards
  regression model (p).
