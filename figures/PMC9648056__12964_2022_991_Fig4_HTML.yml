caption: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) receive a specific communication pattern
  from malignant effusion cells associated with the differentiation pathway and EGFR
  tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance. Incoming patterns for signaling A, cell B,
  and communication C of multiple cell types in malignant abdominal fluids of ovarian
  cancer patients obtained with CellChat [] from scRNA-seq data []. The asterisks
  in C indicate pathways not associated with CAFs and epithelial cells communication
  (communication pattern 1, cluster 2). This communication pattern 1 (cluster 2) was
  used to identify pathways for gene sets of cells ligands D and CAFs receptors for
  these ligands E. In both D and E, the focal adhesion-PI3K-AKT-mTOR are among the
  top altered pathways. The top 10 pathway terms (lowest adjusted P-value) were selected
  from WikiPathways 2021 and MSigDB Hallmark 2020 libraries available in EnrichR [,
