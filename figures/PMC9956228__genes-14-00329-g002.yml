caption: Epigenetics of aging. The “epigenetic clock”, a biomedical measure of aging,
  primarily includes DNA methylation and histone modification status. During both
  cellular and systemic aging, epigenetic age increases. The epigenetic clock can
  be reversed by calorie restriction, mitochondrial activation, reprogramming, and
  extracellular vesicles. The section on histone modifications partially references
  the pathway and diagram of cell signaling technology (CST), and mainly lists histone
  modifications related to aging and regulatory kinases related to histone modifications.
  Ac, histone acetylation; me, histone methylation.
