caption: 'Preparation and characterization of 3D printed composite hydrogel biological
  scaffolds. (a) 3D printing preparation process of the biological scaffolds. Hydrogels
  were assigned to five groups according to densities of loaded cells. (b) Cells were
  evenly distributed in the hydrogel scaffold, with some of the cells being stretched
  in a spindle shape (red arrows) as observed under an optical microscope. Scale bars:
  white 200 ​μm, yellow 100 ​μm. (c) XRD patterns and (d) FTIR spectra of Gel, Alg,
  Lap and the Mixture after bioprinting. (e) Compression modulus of cell-loaded hydrogels
  on the day 1 and day 7 after preparation. (f) Swelling ratios of each group indicated
  that cell density had no significant effect on hydration performance of the hydrogels
  with high water contents. αP<0.05 vs T0; βP<0.05 vs T5; γP<0.05 vs T6; δP<0.05 vs
  T7. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader
  is referred to the Web version of this article.)'
