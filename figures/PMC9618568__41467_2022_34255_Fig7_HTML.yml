figure_title: Transcriptomic characterization of cyst-lining cells originated from
  collecting duct
caption: a Subclustering of CNT_PC on the UMAP plot of snRNA-seq dataset with annotation
  by disease condition (left) or subtype (right). N-CNT normal CNT, N-PC normal PC,
  PKD-CNT ADPKD-specific CNT, PKD-CDC ADPKD-specific collecting duct cells, LowQC
  low-quality cells. b Dot plot showing gene expression patterns of the genes enriched
  in each subpopulation. For N-PC and N-CNT, control and ADPKD data were individually
  shown. The diameter of the dot corresponds to the proportion of cells expressing
  the indicated gene and the intensity of the dot corresponds to average expression
  relative to all CNT_PC cells. c Dot plot showing TNF expression among subclusters
  (left). The diameter of the dot corresponds to the proportion of cells expressing
  the indicated gene and the density of the dot corresponds to average expression
  relative to all CNT_PC cells. UMAP plot displaying TNF expression (right). The color
  scale represents a normalized log-fold-change (LFC). d Heatmap showing enrichment
  of hallmark genesets in each cell type in CNT_PC clusters. Source data are provided
  as a Source Data file. e UMAP displaying enrichment of genes upregulated by IL6
  via STAT3 (upper left), genes regulated by NF-κB pathway in response to TNFα (upper
  right), genes upregulated in response to hypoxia (lower left) and genes encoding
  proteins involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis (lower right) in snRNA-seq dataset.
  f UMAP plot displaying GPRC5A gene expression in CNT_PC subtypes. The color scale
  represents a normalized LFC. g Representative immunofluorescence images of CDH1
  (green) and GPRC5A (red) in the ADPKD (left and middle, n = 3) or control kidneys
  (right, n = 3). Scale bar indicates 50 µm.
