caption: Caspase-8 activation induced by APG-1252-M1 is likely secondary to Bax-dependent
  activation of caspase-3 and facilitates activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic
  pathway. A, The given cell lines were exposed to DMSO, 1 μM APG-1252-M1, 3 μM ABT199
  and 3 μM ABT263 for 4 h. The proteins of interest were detected with Western blotting.
  CF, cleaved from. B, HCT116 cells were pre-treated with 40 μM Z-VAD or Z-IETD for
  30 min and then co-treated with 1 μM APG-1252-M1 or 3 μM ABT263 for additional 4 h.
  The cells were then harvested for preparation of cytosolic fraction and subsequent
  Western blotting. C, A schema for a working model suggesting feedback activation
  of caspase-8 by caspase-3 and subsequent feedforward facilitation of the mitochondrial
  apoptotic pathway during APG-1252-M1-induced apoptosis. The combination of APG-1252-M1
  with Mcl-1 inhibition has maximal effect on the induction of Bax-mediated apoptosis.

  cancer cells to APG-1252-M1, a novel Bcl-2/Bcl-XL dual inhibitor that induces Bax-dependent
  apoptosis.
