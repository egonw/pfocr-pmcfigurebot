caption: PRDX1 knock-down induced cell death via apoptosis in HCC cells. A. Significant
  increase of PRDX1 mRNA expression level when overexpressed in hepatoma cells. B.
  Western blot showed that PRDX1 overexpression enhanced expression level of PRDX1,
  while knock-down of this gene substantially reduced the expression. C. Quantification
  of the protein levels. D. CCK-8 assay showed a significant reduction in the IC50
  value of hepatoma cells. E. Clonal formation assay demonstrated effect of PRDX1
  expression on the proliferation of hepatoma cells. Knock-down PRDX1 showed a significant
  inhibitory effect on cells proliferation. F. Quantification of the number of colonies.
  G. Western results showed the effect of knock-down of PRDX1 protein on caspase proteins
  in hepatoma cells. H. Quantification of the protein levels. The experiment was repeated
  three times. Data represent mean Â± SEM. **; P<0.01, and ***; P<0.001.
