caption: Loss of OsTGA5 function enhances immune responses. A, Time course of ROS
  burst generated from ZH11 and Ostga5-1 leaf discs treated with 400 nM chitin. Data
  are means ± se (n = 16). The data are from one representative out of three independent
  experiments. B, Chitin-induced callose deposition on ZH11 and Ostga5-1 leaves. The
  rice leaves were treated with 400 nM chitin, and callose deposition was imaged with
  a microscope under UV light (left), scale bars = 50 μm. The amount of callose deposition
  was quantified with ImageJ (right). Data are means ± se (n = 18, randomly chosen
  leaf regions of interest). Significant differences were determined by one-way ANOVA
  (*P < 0.05). This assay was performed in three independent replicates with similar
  results. C, Free SA contents in ZH11 and Ostga5-1 seedlings with or without inoculation
  with Guy11, as measured by ultra-performance LC–MS/MS. Data are means ± se from
  three biological replicates. Significant differences were determined by one-way
  ANOVA (*P < 0.05). D, Relative transcript levels of defense-related genes in the
  SA signaling pathway in ZH11 and Ostga5-1 before and after spraying inoculation
  with Guy11 conidia, as analyzed by RT-qPCR. Rice UBQ was used as the internal control.
  Data are means ± se (n = 3). Significant differences were determined by one-way
  ANOVA (**P < 0.01). The data are from one of three independent representative experiments.
