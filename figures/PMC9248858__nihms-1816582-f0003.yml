figure_title: IL-1β is necessary for HFD-induced RPE iron accumulation and dysfunction
caption: (A) Human fetal RPE (fRPE) cultures were treated with either transferrin-bound
  ferric iron (Tf·55Fe3+) or ferrous iron ascorbate (55Fe2+) alone or in the presence
  of recombinant IL-1β (rIL-1β). Intracellular iron accumulation in fRPE lysates was
  measured during 8 h of treatment using a scintillation counter to quantify counts
  per minute (CPM) (n = 3/group).(B) fRPE cultures were treated with either media
  (vehicle) or recombinant IL-1β (rIL-1β) for 8 h before cells were harvested for
  qPCR analysis of iron transport/ regulatory genes (n = 6/group).(C) Mass in grams
  of WT and Il1b−/− (KO) mice fed an LFD or an HFD (n = 20/group).(D) VAT and SAT
  hypertrophy were dependent on diet but not genotype (n = 10/group).(E) Diet and
  genotype had no effect on glycemic control measured with intraperitoneal glucose
  tolerance test (n = 10/group).(F) RPE gene expression measured by qPCR following
  12 weeks of either LFD or HFD (n = 5/group).(G) Retinal CD11b+ cell gene expression
  following 12 weeks of either LFD or HFD (n = 5/group).(H) HFD WT mice accumulate
  RPE iron, measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, which is
  rescued in the HFD Il1b−/− mice (n = 10/group).(I) HFD WT mice accumulate lipid
  oxidation product MDA in RPE, which is rescued in HFD Il1b−/− mice (n = 10/group).(J)
  HFD WT mice RPE upregulate Hmox1 in an Il1b-dependent manner (n = 5/group).(K) HFD
  WT mice exhibit c-wave amplitude deficits, measured by electroretinography, which
  is rescued in HFD Il1b−/− mice (n = 10/group).Data indicate mean and, where error
  bars are shown, ± SD. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001, by 1-way
  ANOVA with multiple comparisons (A), unpaired Student’s t test (B), or 2-way repeated-measures
  ANOVA (C and E) or 2-way ANOVA (D and F–K) with Tukey’s HSD post hoc test.
