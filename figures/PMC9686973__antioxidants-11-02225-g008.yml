caption: A model describing the silenced GhDi19-3 and GhDi19-4 gene regulates cotton
  tolerance to salt stress. GhDi19-3 and GhDi19-4 were up-regulated under salt stress,
  and the silencing of GhDi19-3 or GhDi19-4 genes led to a change in up- and down-regulation
  of calcium signaling and ABA signaling pathway related genes (GhCDPK2-1A, GhCDPK2-1D,
  GhCDPK2-2A, GhCDPK2-2D, GhCIPK11-A, GhCIPK11-D, GhABI5, GhRD29B-A, and GhRD29B-D),
  which then resulted in their abilities improving to effectively reduce the ROS damage
  when cotton plants were subject to salt stress. Taken together, GhDi19-3 and GhDi19-4,
  as two negative regulatory transcription factors, responded to salt stress by being
  involved in calcium signaling and ABA signaling pathways.
