caption: Enrichment analysis for FGL1 obtained from KEGG. (A) Comparison of results
  with significance in different analysis of various tumors. (B) FGL1 signaling pathway
  analysis in PAAD, LIHC, LGG, LUAD, LUSC, and THCA. The horizontal axis represents
  the enrichment score, and the vertical axis represents the KEGG terms. The color
  of the column represents the significance; the closer to red, the higher the significance.
  (C) Top three KEGG pathways in which FGL1 is enriched in PAAD, LIHC, LGG, LUAD,
  LUSC, and THCA. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend,
  the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)
