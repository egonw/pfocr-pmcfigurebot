caption: 'Effect of CNP extract on glutamate-induced cytotoxicity in HT22 cells. The
  cell viability was evaluated via MTT assay. (a) Cells were treated with CNP extract
  (0.1–100 µg/mL) for 24 h. (b) After treating the cells with CNP extract for 24 h,
  this was followed by 5 mM glutamate for 18 h. (c) The proportion of cell death with
  the percentage of LDH released was evaluated via LDH assay. (d) After the treatment,
  the morphology of HT22 cells was observed using a light microscope. Values are expressed
  as the means ± SD (n = 3). Note: *** p < 0.001 versus cell control, # p < 0.05 versus
  cell control, * p < 0.05 versus 5 mM glutamate-treated cells.'
