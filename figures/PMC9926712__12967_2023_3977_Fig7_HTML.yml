caption: Expression of peripheral SGK1 predicts postoperative prognosis in patients
  with CRLM. Neutrophils were extracted from the peripheral blood of CRLM patients
  1 day before or after surgery. A The expression of SGK1 mRNA in isolated neutrophils
  was detected by Quantitative RT-PCR 1 day before or after surgery (n = 16 samples).
  B and C Serum ALT and AST levels in CRLM patients 1 day after operation were detected
  by Elisa, and their correlation with SGK1 mRNA expression in peripheral blood neutrophils
  was analyzed (n = 16 samples). D and E As previously described, the level of LOX1
  was detected in postoperative serum of CRLM patients, and analyzed its correlation
  with postoperative serum ALT and AST (n = 16 samples). F Schematic diagram of the
  signaling pathways involved in hepatic IR induced metastasis. Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion
  injury releases SAA by activating the SGK1/IL-6/STAT3 pathway, while inducing the
  infiltration of NETS and PMN-MDSC to form a pro-metastatic niche and promote postoperative
  recurrence of CRLM. All data represent the mean ± SD. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001****p < 0.0001
