caption: Correlation analysis between the expression of LAMC2, Lnc_AC006548.28, and
  miR-223 in gastric cancer tissue. (a) The protein level of LAMC2 in different tissues
  was detected by western blot; (b) the positive percentage of LAMC2 was detected
  by RT-PCR; it was higher in cancer tissue group than that of paracancerous tissue
  group; (c) the expression of LAMC2 protein was detected by western blot; the protein
  level in cancer tissue was higher than that in paracancerous tissue; (d) quantitative
  PCR was used to detect the expression of LAMC2 mRNA; the expression of Lnc_AC006548.28
  in cancer tissues was higher than that in adjacent tissues; (e) the correlation
  between the expression of LAMC2, Lnc_AC006548.28 and miR-223 was detected by correlation
  analysis between genes.
