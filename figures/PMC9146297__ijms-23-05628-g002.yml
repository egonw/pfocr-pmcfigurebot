caption: 'Nitric oxide signaling associated with ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in
  plants: (a) represents the N-degron pathway (already described in detail in ); (b)
  under certain environmental conditions, NO can trigger ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal
  degradation of some proteins via S-nitrosylation, for example, APX1 and ABI5; (c)
  meanwhile, NO can also protect certain proteins by preventing their degradation
  via S-nitrosylation; (d) NO-mediated PTMs, such as tyrosine nitration, also leads
  to the proteolytic degradation via ubiquitin-mediated PTMs. Limited evidence is
  available for these pathways in plants; therefore, the dashed lines and question
  marks are used which represent further clarification of these signaling pathways
  in plants. SNO represents S-nitrosothiol; NO2-Tyr represents tyrosine nitration.
