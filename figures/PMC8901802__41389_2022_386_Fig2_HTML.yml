figure_title: PSMC2 knockdown suppressed the growth of tumor in vivo
caption: A Representative images of in vivo imaging. B The fluorescence intensity
  of nude mice in the PSMC3 knockdown group and control group was detected. C Pictures
  of solid tumors taken out of nude mice. D The tumor volume growth rate of nude mice
  in the PSMC2 knockdown group was smaller than that in the control group. E The tumor
  weight of nude mice in the PSMC2 knockdown group was lower than that in the control
  group. F The immumohistochemical staining was performed to detect the Ki67 expression
  in the tumor tissues. **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001, compared with shCtrl group. Error
  bars meant SD.
