caption: Highly schematized flow chart of a pathological circuit in AD brain flowing
  along the gut–brain axis (see manuscript text). The interactions among GI-tract-microbiome-derived
  LPSs, pro-inflammatory cytokines and ROS in the generation of the pro-inflammatory
  transcription factor NF-kB (p50/p65) complex are not completely understood; other
  miRNAs and mRNAs are expected to be involved in this pathological cascade; importantly,
  the GI-tract microbiome provides a long-term and life-long source of LPSs; specific
  components of this pathological pathway provide multiple therapeutic targets for
  the more effective clinical management of AD.
