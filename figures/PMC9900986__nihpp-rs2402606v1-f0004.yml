figure_title: CCR2 macrophages co-localize with and signal to fibroblasts via IL-1b
  in MI and HF
caption: (A) NicheNet derived predictions of enriched signaling from other cell types
  to fibroblasts in HF (acute MI, ICM, NICM) relative to donor. (B) IL-1b RNA expression
  in global CITE-seq UMAP embedding. (C) IL-1b RNA expression in myeloid subsets (left)
  with corresponding CCR2 protein expression (middle), and IL-1b expression density
  and imputed CCR2 protein expression in an acute MI IZ spatial transcriptomic sample.
  (D) Immunofluorescence of IL-1b (red) in CCR2 GFP (green) mice at day 7 post Ang
  II/PE mini-pump implantation. (E) Rank sorted TF motifs enriched in HF fibroblasts
  relative to donor fibroblasts from Multiome data show enriched inflammatory signaling.
  (F) Average expression of IL-1B in macrophages per HF patient versus RUNX1 (left)
  and POSTN (right) in fibroblasts from the same patient. R2 indicates the regression
  coefficient and the p-value tests whether the slope is significantly non-zero. (G)
  SPOTlight derived cell-cell proportion correlation in acute MI patient. (H) z-score
  for marker genes in F9 (POSTN, COMP, FAP, COL1A1, THBS4, COL3A1) and F2 (ACTA2,
  TAGN) (top) and CD68/CD4 and CD68/FAP joint density embedding plot (bottom). (I)
  RUNX1/POSTN co-localization density plot (left) and PROGENy imputed NF-kB pathway
  score (right). (J) UMAP embedding plot of spatial clusters with three distinct niches
  and corresponding spatial location of clusters. (K) Dot plot of marker genes and
  gene set scores for spatial niches. (L) CD68/CD4, CD68/FAP (top) and F2 and F9 fibroblast
  gene signature (bottom) joint density embedding plot in UMAP embedding. (M) Heatmap
  of top differentially expressed genes across spatial niches. (N) PROGENy pathway
  analysis for spatial clusters in (J). (O) Study design for IL-1 receptor deletion
  in fibroblasts in mice with Ang II/PE minipump implantation, (P) representative
  images of trichrome staining, and (Q) quantification of fibrosis at day 28.
