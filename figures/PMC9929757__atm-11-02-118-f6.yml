caption: Associations between (S)-3,4-DCPG and MSOP treatments and expression levels
  of inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory signaling pathway (TLR4, NF-κB). (A)
  TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 mRNA expression in colon samples among the groups (n=6).
  (B) TLR4 and NF-κB expression in the colon samples among the groups (n=3–5). (C)
  Expression levels of TLR4 and NF-κB in Figure B that was measured by grey values.
  Results were compared by the one-way ANOVA and presented as the mean ± SD, *P<0.05.
  mRNA, messenger RNA; ANOVA, analysis of variance; SD, standard deviation; TNF-α,
  tumor necrosis factor-α; TLR4, toll-like receptor 4; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; IL,
  interleukin; NMS, neonatal maternal separation; DCPG, dicarboxyphenylglycine; MSOP,
  (RS)-α-methylserine-O-phosphate.
