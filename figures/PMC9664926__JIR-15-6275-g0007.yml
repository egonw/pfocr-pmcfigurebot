caption: 'Proteinâ€“protein interaction (PPI) network and drug sensitivity analysis
  of CTSZ. (A) PPI network and functional analysis of CTSZ and its neighboring genes.
  Different colors of the network edge indicate the bioinformatics methods applied:
  physical interaction, coexpression, website prediction, colocalization, pathway
  and genetic interactions, and shared protein domains. The different colors of network
  nodes indicate the enrichment results of the gene set. The size of each circle represents
  the rank of gene that correlated with CTSZ. The width of each line represents the
  weight of the corresponding individual data source in the composite network. (B)
  Correlation between CTSZ expression and small molecule/drug sensitivity (IC50) based
  on the GDSC database.'
