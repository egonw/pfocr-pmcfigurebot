caption: 'Phenotypic characterization of CD45 + cells in the cohort. a Overview of
  the study—Patient cohort and study samples. b Uniform Manifold Approximation and
  Projection (UMAP) representation and unsupervised clustering of all cells from the
  IMA samples (n = 3) profiled with scRNA + TCRαβ-seq. c Left: UMAP representation
  of the cells from ST and PB in each cluster as identified in our study. Middle:
  UMAP representation of the cells as per sorting strategy in each cluster as identified
  in our study. Right: UMAP representation of the cells representing different disease
  types. d Dot plot with scaled expression of top 8 DE genes between IMA phenotype
  clusters (Padj < 0.05, calculated as Bonferroni corrected Wilcoxon test). e Number
  of DE genes both upregulated and downregulated between cells from ST and PB for
  each cluster (Padj < 0.05, |Log2FC| > 0.5 calculated with Bonferroni corrected two-sided
  t-test). f Pathway enrichment analysis with GO biological processes (Hypergeometric
  testing). g Left: Focused UMAP of all cells with TCR from panel 1b. Right: Proportion
  of the cells identified as Hyperexpanded (> 9), Expanded (> 1) and Singlet as identified
  in the UMAP. h Cells detected as expanded versus cells detected as singlets in ST
  and PB in our data shows that expanded cells are enriched in ST (Padj < 0.05, Benjamini–Hochberg
  corrected Fisher’s one-sided exact test)'
