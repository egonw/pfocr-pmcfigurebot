caption: 'Involvement of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway in the NGR1-induced attenuation
  of neuronal inflammation after SCI. (a) The representative image of Western Blot
  analysis for IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α in the Sham + vehicle, SCI + vehicle, SCI +
  NGR1, and SCI + NGR1 + ML385 groups at 21 days after SCI. (b–d) Quantitative analysis
  of IL-6/actin, IL-1β/actin, and TNF-α/actin in each group. N = 3. Data are represented
  as mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05 vs. the Sham + vehicle group; #P < 0.05 vs. the SCI + vehicle
  group; &P < 0.05 vs. the SCI + NGR1 group. (e–g) Quantitative analysis of the mRNA
  expression of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α in each group. N = 3. Data are represented
  as mean ± SEM. One-way analysis of ANOVA with Turkey’s post hoc tests was used.
  *P < 0.05 vs. the Sham + vehicle group; #P < 0.05 vs. the SCI + NGR1 group; &P <
  0.05 vs. the SCI + NGR1 group. ANOVA, analysis of variance; HO-1, heme oxygenase-1;
  NGR1, notoginsenoside R1; Nrf2, nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2; SCI,
  spinal cord injury.'
article_title: Notoginsenoside R1 alleviates spinal cord injury by inhibiting oxidative
  stress, neuronal apoptosis, and inflammation via activating the nuclear factor erythroid
  2 related factor 2/heme oxygenase-1 signaling pathway.
