caption: Methyltransferases participate in ESCA progression in an m6A-independent
  way. (A) Ref. [] METTL3 promoted proliferation, migration and invasion of ESCC cells
  and suppressed apoptosis of ESCC cells by activating Wnt/Î²-catenin and AKT signaling
  pathways; (B) Ref. [] METTL3 facilitated proliferation, migration and invasion of
  ESCC cells and repressed apoptosis of ESCC cells by activating PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathway; (C) Ref. [] METTL3 increased COL12A1 expression, activated MAPK signaling
  pathway and promoted proliferation, migration and invasion of ESCC cells.
