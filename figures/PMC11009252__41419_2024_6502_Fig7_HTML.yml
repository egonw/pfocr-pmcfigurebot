figure_title: PDZK1 sensitizes TNBC cells to erlotinib in vitro and in vivo
caption: A, B PDZK1-WT, but not PDZK1-MT_S2,3 overexpression sensitised TNBC cells
  to erlotinib in inhibiting EGFR-mediated signalling pathway. WB analysis of phosphorylation
  levels of EGFR and its downstream molecules in TNBC cells stably expressing empty
  vector or PDZK1-WT or PDZK1-MT_S2,3 combined with erlotinib treatment. All WBs are
  representative of one of three independent experiments (A, B). PDZK1 overexpression
  sensitised TNBC cells to erlotinib in inhibiting cell proliferation (C, D), colony
  formation (E), migration (F, G) and invasion (H) abilities. The photo (I), the volume
  (J) and the weight (K) of xenograft tumours, treated with PDZK1 overexpression alone,
  erlotinib alone or a combination of PDZK1 overexpression with erlotinib (n = 6 mice
  per group). IHC results of Ki67 level (L) and EGFR/pEGFR/pERK level (M) in xenograft
  tumour tissues. Data are shown as mean ± SD of three independent experiments. Data
  were analysed by repeated measures ANOVA (C, D) and ANOVA (E–H, J–M). *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 and ****P < 0.0001. ns, not significant.
