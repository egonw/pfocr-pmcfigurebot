caption: Innate immune response against Treponema pallidum. While Tpp is located extracellularly,
  B cells can secrete opsonizing antibodies and recruit complementing proteins to
  induce the classical pathway complement system. On the other hand, macrophages can
  recognize lipoproteins from the outer membrane of Tpp through TLR1 and TLR2 and
  phagocytose the bacteria.
