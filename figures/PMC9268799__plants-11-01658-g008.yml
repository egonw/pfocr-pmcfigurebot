caption: 'The effects of Centipeda minima (CMX), brevilin A, and Z-IETD-FMK (a caspase-8
  inhibitor) on apoptotic cell death in AGS human gastric cancer cells. (A) Representative
  images of apoptotic cells stained with annexin V (green) and propidium iodide (red)
  were obtained using a Tali Image-Based Cytometer. (B) The experiment was performed
  in triplicate. The error bars represent the standard deviation of samples (n = 3).
  * p < 0.05 compared with that of the control. # p < 0.05 difference with Z-IETD-FMK
  group.'
