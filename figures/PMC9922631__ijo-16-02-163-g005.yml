figure_title: Differentially expressed genes and bioinformatics assay between non-HGT
  and LACC-HGT cells
caption: 'A: Heatmap of differentially expressed genes between non-HGT and LACC-HGT
  cells. B: GO analyses of differentially expressed genes between non-HGT and LACC-HGT
  cells. The BP bar chart represents extracellular matrix organization, cell adhesion,
  cell-cell adhesion, signal transduction, positive regulation of cell migration,
  response to mechanical stimulus, response to virus, positive regulation of phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase signaling, axon guidance, and angiogenesis in descending order. The MF
  bar chart represents extracellular matrix structural constituent, extracellular
  matrix structural constituent conferring tensile strength, actin binding, heparin
  binding, proteoglycan binding, SH3 domain binding, cytoskeletal protein binding,
  calcium ion binding, muscle alpha-actinin binding, Rho guanyl-nucleotide exchange
  factor activity in descending order. The CC bar chart represents plasma membrane,
  basement membrane, cytoplasm, integral component of plasma membrane, extracellular
  matrix, cell surface, Z disc, intracellular membrane-bounded organelle, postsynaptic
  density, and adherence junction in descending order. C: KEGG pathway analyses of
  differentially expressed genes between non-HGT and LACC-HGT cells. GO: Gene ontology;
  KEGG: Kyoto Encycl opedia of Genes and Genomes; BP: Biological process; MF: Molecular
  function; CC: Cellular components; LACC-HGT: Lacrimal gland adenoid cystic carcinoma
  with high-grade transformation.'
