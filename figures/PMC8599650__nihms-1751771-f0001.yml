figure_title: Cigarette smoke extract (CSE) alters cysteine metabolism in pancreatic
  cancer
caption: (a) Partial least discriminant analysis showing metabolic shift in PDAC cell
  lines exposed to CSE. Each colored circle indicates a biological replicate used
  for metabolite analysis and three similar colored replicates indicate biological
  replicates of same condition, (b) Heatmaps deciphering metabolic differences between
  24 h vehicle and CSE-treated PDAC. Each row represents a metabolite and each heatmap
  column represents the profile from a replicate. The heatmap scale on the right side
  indicates relative change in the metabolite level with red indicating an increase
  and green indicating decrease in metabolite levels, respectively, (c) Pathway impact
  analyses revealing significantly altered metabolic pathways in CSE-exposed PDAC
  cells. The color in circles indicates combined impact of the respective pathway
  with red showing high impact and yellow showing lower impact. The size of each circle
  indicates number of metabolites detected in corresponding pathways and (d & e) Bar
  plots showing relative changes in metabolites (n=3, *, ** and *** indicate p<0.05,
  0.01 and 0.001, respectively).
