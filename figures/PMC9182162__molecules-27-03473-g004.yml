caption: 'Effect of AT on Ca2+-related signaling pathway in C48/80-stimulated RBL-2H3
  cells. (A). The expression of p-PLCγ, PLCγ, p-IP3R, IP3R, and GAPDH were analyzed
  by Western blot. (B). Quantification of the proteins in (A). The density of each
  band was quantified by Image J Software (ImageJ 1.50e). The data are presented as
  the mean ± S.D. *** p < 0.001 versus the model group. ### p < 0.001 versus the control
  group, n = 3.'
