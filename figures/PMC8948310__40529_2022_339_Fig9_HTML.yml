caption: Synthesis pathway of amino acids. Red indicates a significant increase in
  metabolite content in the experimental group, blue represents the metabolite was
  detected but no significant change, and green indicates a significant decrease in
  metabolite content in the experimental group. The red boxes represent that the metabolite
  content is significantly up-regulated in HN65, and the blue boxes represent that
  the metabolite is detected in HN65 but have no significant change
