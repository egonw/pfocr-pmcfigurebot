caption: Activation of the JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway dominated the ASP-AMP-promoted
  liver regeneration. (a) PPI network of the common targets of drugs and liver regeneration.
  According to the degree value, the nodes were arranged from large to small and the
  color of the node changes from orange to yellow to green. (b) GO enrichment analysis.
  The top four terms in Biological Process, Cellular Component and Molecular Function
  are displayed. (c) The KEGG signaling pathway of ASP and AMP promoting liver regeneration.
  (d) RT-PCR analysis of predictive target factors in ASP-AMP promoted liver regeneration
  (n = 3). (e) The expression of JAK2, p-JAK2, STAT3, and p-STAT3 in hepatocytes were
  analyzed by Western blot (n = 3). (f) Densitometric analysis of grey value related
  to β-actin expression. (g) Pharmacologically inhibiting JAK2 downregulated the expression
  of p-STAT3, MYC, and PCNA, and upregulated p53 (n = 3). (h) Quantitative analysis
  of protein expression related to β-actin. (i) Lactate expression in the supernatant
  of hepatocytes with ASP-AMP and/or ruxolitinib treatment for 3 days (n = 3). (j)
  Cell viability of NCTC clone 1469 cells treated with ASP-AMP and/or ruxolitinib
  for 7 days (n = 3). (k) Click-iT EdU proliferation staining of hepatocytes treated
  with ASP-AMP and/or ruxolitinib for 3 days and relative expression rates of positive
  EdU staining (scale bar = 100 µm). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001.
