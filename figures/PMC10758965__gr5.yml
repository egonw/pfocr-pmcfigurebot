caption: 'Compartmentalization of the one-carbon metabolism pathway. A, Cytosolic,
  nuclear, and mitochondrial membrane-bound compartments are depicted. In addition,
  the membraneless protein assembly, the purinosome, is depicted associated with mitochondria
  via the microtubule network. Dotted lines represent metabolite relocation; solid
  arrows represent individual enzymatic reactions. Small orange circle on individual
  enzymes represents posttranslational modification with small ubiquitin like modifier
  (SUMO). B, IMP synthesis is a multistep process starting from the formation of 5-phospho-α-D-ribosyl
  1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) from ribose-5-phosphate. The first committed step in purine
  synthesis is the reaction of PRPP, glutamine and water to 5′-phosphoribosylamine
  (PRA), glutamate, and pyrophosphate—catalyzed by PPAT. Further reactions are catalyzed
  by trifunctional GART (steps 2, 3, 5), FGAMS (step 4), bifunctional PAICS (steps
  6 and 7), ADSL (step 8), and bifunctional ATIC (steps 9 and 10). Two of the reactions
  require 10-formyl THF: the formation of 5′-phosphoribosyl-N-formylglycinamide (FGAR)
  from glycineamide ribonucleotide (GAR) by GART and the formation of phosphoribosyl
  formamidocarboxamide (FAICAR) from 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide
  (AICAR) by ATIC. Reaction intermediates further include: 5-phosphoribosylamine (5-PRA),
  phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine (FGAM), 5-amino-1-(5-phospho-β-D-ribosyl)imidazole
  (AIR), 5-amino-1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxylate (CAIR), 5-amino-4-imidazole-N-succinocarboxamide
  ribonucleotide (SAICAR). For brevity, the utilization of further reaction substrates
  such as ATP or H2O is not depicted. ADSL, adenylosuccinate lyase; ATIC, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide
  ribonucleotide formyltransferase/IMP cyclohydrolase; FGAMS, phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine
  synthase; GART, trifunctional purine biosynthetic protein adenosine-3; mTHF, 5,10-methylene
  THF; PAICS, phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase; PPAT, amidophosphoribosyltransferase.'
