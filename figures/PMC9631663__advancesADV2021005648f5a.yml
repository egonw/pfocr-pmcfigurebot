caption: Characterization of inflammatory gene profiles in platelets. (A-B) RNA-Seq
  data from ET (N = 7) or healthy control (N = 3) platelets were filtered by using
  Hallmark inflammatory response (A, n = 200) or IFN response (B, n = 224) genes,
  followed by unsupervised hierarchical clustering by Euclidean distance (differentially
  expressed genes are shown). Note clear segregation of phenotypes in both panels.
  (C) In silico expression studies of aggregated IFN response genes (n = 224) by phenotype
  (normal, n = 3; ET, n = 7); data are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean
  (SEM) of reads per kilobase per million (RPKM) normalized and scaled to mean 0.
  (D) Platelet quantitative polymerase chain reaction of select IRGs or platelet-specific
  genes (VWF and PF4) from a secondary cohort of healthy controls (n = 4) or ET (n
  = 8), expressed as mean ± SEM normalized to actin; box plots (panels C-D) represent
  the within-group interquartile range encompassing 50% of the values, whereas the
  95% CIs and outliers are depicted. The horizontal bar within each box represents
  the group median. P values (t test) are shown. NS, not significant.
