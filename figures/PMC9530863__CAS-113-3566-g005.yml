caption: LRFN2 inhibits the growth of transplanted tumor in NOD/SCID mice. (A–C) In
  comparison with the control group, the size, tumor volume, and growth rate of subcutaneous
  tumor formation with KYSE30 cells overexpressing LRFN2 was significantly lower.
  (D) LRN2 expression increased in the overexpression group, compared with the control
  group. (E) Pathology of the transplanted tumor in the two groups after H&E staining.
  In the control group, enlarged nuclei, deep staining, increased mitosis, and obvious
  tissue atypia were observed in the cancer cells, whereas the pLVX‐LRFN2 group showed
  lighter staining, smaller nuclei, and less tissue atypia, indicating that LRFN2
  can cause histomorphological changes in esophageal carcinoma. (F) Comparison of
  Ki67 in two groups of transplanted tumors. Expression of Ki67 was significantly
  decreased in the pLVX‐LRFN2 group with LRFN2 overexpression. **p < 0.001.
