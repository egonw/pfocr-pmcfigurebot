caption: 'Increased PCAF expression in endothelia of aged mice and palmitate acid
  (PA) or X radiation treated HUVECs. (a) Western blotting analysis and qualification
  of PCAF and senescence-associated protein expression in HUVECs stimulated with PA
  (0.3 mM) for the indicated time points. (b) Western blotting analysis and qualification
  of PCAF and senescence-associated protein expression in HUVECs treated with or without
  X radiation (15 gray). (c) mRNA levels of PCAF, IL-6, and IL-1β in HUVECs treated
  with vehicle or PA for indicated time points. (d) and (e) Immunohistochemical (IHC)
  stain and quantitative analysis of blood vessels from young (4 w) and old (one and
  half-year-old) mice with PCAF antibody. Scale bars: 100 μm. (f) and (g) SaβG staining
  and quantitative analysis of vector and PA-treated HUVECs. Scale bars, 20 μm. Y:
  young mice; O: old mice. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM (∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001, n.s. P > 0.05).'
