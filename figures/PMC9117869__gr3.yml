caption: AuPhos-19 inhibits oxygen consumption in TNBC(A) ECAR vs OCR extrapolated
  from seahorse metabolism analysis. Mean ± SEM (n = 3).(B) Index of metabolic dependence
  on OXPHOS and glycolysis.(C and D) Bar graphs showing OCR and ECAR readings extrapolated
  from seahorse metabolism analysis represented in A and B.(E) Schematic representation
  of the Seahorse mitochondrial respiration experiment.(F) Seahorse bioenergetic stress
  test of AuPhos-19 in MDA-MB-468. Normalization of OCR was done per 1,000 cells.
  Data are plotted as the mean ± SEM, n = 4.(G–I) Extrapolated data from Mito stress
  test of MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with AuPhos-19. Data are plotted
  as the mean ± SEM (n = 4). Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s
  multiple comparison test (∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001. n.s. =
  not significant).(J) Western blot analyses of proteins associated with the AMPK
  pathway. TNBC cells were treated with AuPhos-19 (1μM) for 24 h.
