caption: 'Effects of the FDA-approved MEK inhibitors on OVV replication and oncolytic
  cell death in A2780 and A2780-R cells(A) A2780 and A2780-R cells were pre-treated
  with the cobimetinib, trametinib, or sorafenib, followed by OVV infection and flow
  cytometric analysis of GFP-positive population. The percentages of GFP-positive
  population are indicated. (B and C) Effect of the STAT3 inhibitor on the trametinib-stimulated
  OVV replication. A2780 and A2780-R cells were pre-treated with 2 μM trametinib or
  10 μM cryptotanshinone and then infected with 0.01 MOI OVV. After 24 h, GFP expression
  in A2780 and A2780-R cells was measured by fluorescence microscopy (B) and flow
  cytometric analysis (C). The scale in (B) indicates 100 μm. (D) Effects of the STAT3
  inhibitor on the trametinib-stimulated STAT3 phosphorylation in A2780-R cells. The
  expression and phosphorylation levels of ERK and STAT3 were measured by western
  blotting. GAPDH was used as a loading control. Data are represented as mean ± SEM.
