figure_title: FAT10 regulates EMT to promote chemotherapeutic resistance in PC cells
caption: A Spearman correlation analysis of the correlation between FAT10 (UBD) and
  EMT pathway score. FAT10 expression is represented by the abscissa, and the EMT
  pathway score is represented by the ordinate. A density curve to the right represents
  the trend in the distribution of pathway scores, a density curve to the upper part
  represents the trend in the distribution of gene expression. The top part shows
  the p-value, correlation coefficient, and correlation calculation method. B Immunofluorescence
  analysis of the effect of inhibiting FAT10 on the expression of EMT-related proteins
  (E-cadherin and Vimentin) in PC cells. Scale bar, 50 μm. C–F GEM-resistant PC cell
  lines (PANC-1/GR and BxPC-3/GR) were transfected with interfering plasmid sh-FAT10#2
  and or EMT activator (TGF-β, 10 ng/mL) for 48 h. C, E Western blot analysis was
  used to observe the expression of EMT-related proteins in each treatment group.
  D, F Cell viability experiments were used to calculate the half-inhibitory concentration
  (IC50) of GEM-treated PC-resistant cells in each treatment group. Data represent
  the mean ± SD of triplicate experiments and were statistically analyzed by one-way
  ANOVA. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
