caption: Major miRNAs that regulate apoptosis effectors are shown in the diagram in
  the yellow box. FasR, Fas Receptor; FADD, Fas-associated death domain protein. miRNAs
  regulate the major cascades of autophagy. The action of miRNAs involved in the regulation
  of key members of autophagy cascades; repression/activation of mRNA are shown in
  the nucleus. mTORC1 induces and regulates the autophagy by miRNAs. AMPK-mTORC1 lies
  at the heart of regulation of autophagy by integrating numerous stimuli and pathways
  into a signal for the starting point of autophagy. In addition, ER stress and ROS
  regulate autophagy independently of the AMPK-mTORC1 pathway. In TNF-α-induced necroptosis,
  the engagement of TNFR1 recruits Complex I (composed of TRADD, TRAF2). This complex
  promotes the NF-κB activation and promotes cell survival and inhibits apoptosis.
  When growth factor receptors are activated, the class I PI3K complex and a small
  GTPase, Ras, are activated, which activate the PI3K-PKD1-AKT and Ras-Raf-1-MEK1/2-ERK1/2
  pathways, respectively. Both AKT and ERK1/2 phosphorylate and inhibit tuberous sclerosis
  complex, thereby stabilizing Ras homolog, which activates mTORC1, resulting in autophagy
  inhibition. JNK1-mediated Bcl-2 phosphorylation reduces the binding activity of
  Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL to initiate autophagy, which promotes cell survival. TLR signaling
  and miRNAs form a complex network. TLR recruits adaptor proteins and activates downstream
  signaling cascades that activate the NF-κB signaling pathway and the MAPK signaling
  pathway in response to specific microbial recognition. This activation causes inflammatory
  mediators and miRNA genes to be expressed.
