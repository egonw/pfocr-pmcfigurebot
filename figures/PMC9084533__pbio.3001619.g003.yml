figure_title: OPTN activates canonical Wnt signaling pathway in myoblasts
caption: (A) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis in si-Optn Hela cells from the GEO dataset
  (GSE6819). (B) Heatmap of the changes in selected Wnts target genes expression levels
  in si-control and si-OPTN Hela cells by RNA-seq from the GEO dataset (GSE6819).
  (C) Representative mRNA expression analysis of Wnt target genes in si-control or
  si-Optn C2C12 cells at 4 days postdifferentiation (n = 3 in each group). (D) Representative
  luciferase activity of TOP/FOP in Optn-KD (left panel) and Optn-OE (right panel)
  C2C12 cells at 4 days postdifferentiation (n = 5 in each group). (E, F) Representative
  immunoblotting analysis and quantification of active β-catenin protein levels in
  nuclear lysates extracted from Optn-OE and Optn KD C2C12 cells at 4 days postdifferentiation
  (E) (n = 3 in each group) and in nuclear lysates extracted from scramble shRNA or
  shOptn TA muscle at 5 days postinjury (F) (n = 3 mice in each group). Data are presented
  as mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05 versus control. The underlying data for this figure can
