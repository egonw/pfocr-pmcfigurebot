caption: Gene identification map, phenotypic analysis and behavioral analysis of Mut
  mice. (a) Gene identification map of homozygous mut mice. The red mark is the mutant
  target gene. (b) Hair map of mut mice. M represents mut mice and W represents WT
  mice. (c) Hair pictures of clinical patients. The two patients were siblings. (d)
  Time required for mice to find food in the Y maze. (e) Number of errors in Y maze
  food search. (f) Time required for mice to contact the escape platform for the first
  time. (g) Number of times the mice shuttle in the escape platform area. (h) 1, 2,
  and 3 are WT mice; 4, 5, and 6 are Mut mice. 1‐1 represents the movement trajectory
  of the water maze device in 120 s after the first quadrant of the first mouse, and
  so on. ns (p > .05), ***(p < .001) compared with the control group
