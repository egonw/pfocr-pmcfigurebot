figure_title: Pathways controlling pyroptosis, apoptosis, ferroptosis, and cuproptosis
caption: a Pyroptosis can be triggered in response to PAMPs or DAMPs, which activate
  inflammasomes such as NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRP4, AIM2, and Pyrin and recruit the adaptor
  ASC, resulting in caspase-1 activation. LPS activates Caspase-4/5/11 in the cytoplasm.
  Ultimately, active caspase-1/4/5/11 cleaves GSDMD to generate GSDMD-NT, resulting
  in pore formation, plasma membrane rupture, cell lysis, and IL-1Î²/18 release. b
  Apoptosis can occur via an intrinsic or extrinsic pathway. The intrinsic pathway
  is activated by mitochondrial damage. Cytochrome c induces apoptotic protease activating
  factor-1 (Apaf-1) and a caspase-9 precursor combine to produce an apoptosome that
  activates caspase-9. In turn, caspase 9 activates caspase-3/7, resulting in apoptosis.
  In the extrinsic pathway, the oligomerization of cell surface death receptors leads
  to caspase-8 activation, which directly cleaves pro-caspase-3 to mediate apoptosis.
  Additionally, caspase-8 can cleave Bid to produce tBid, which migrates to the mitochondria
  and forms Bax/Bak openings on its surface, releasing cytochrome c and initiating
  apoptosis. c Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent RCD, mainly related to iron-dependent
  lipid peroxidation and glutathione (GSH) exhaustion, leading to ROS generation and
  cell death. The ferroportin (SLC40A1), transferrin-transferrin receptor complex
  (TF-TFRC), and ferritinophagy contribute to iron accumulation and cause ferroptosis.
  On the other hand, in conjunction with RAB7A-dependent lipophagy, the ACSL4/LPCAT3/ALOXs
  pathway promotes ferroptosis by activating lipid peroxidation to generate PLOOH.
  GPX4 and other free radical scavengers, such as ferrostatin-1 inhibit lipid peroxidation
  (lipid-ROS). In the absence of GPX4, lipid peroxides accumulate, resulting in the
  onset of ferroptosis. d Cuproptosis can be induced by accumulation of intracellular
  free copper ions. In particular, elesclomol acts as a copper ionophore that facilitates
  copper transport into cells. Intracellular copper levels are also regulated by copper
  importers (SLC31A1) and copper exporters (ATP7B). FDX1, a reductase, is responsible
  for reducing Cu2+ to Cu+ which helps in the lipoylation of mitochondrial TCA cycle
  enzymes, particularly DLAT. This process leads to Fe-S cluster protein instability,
  causing proteotoxic stress and ultimately cell death.
