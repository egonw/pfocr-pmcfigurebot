caption: (A–C). MDS analysis of the environment of C152 and C156 within an isolated
  h−GAPDH subunit to explore the mechanistic interpretation of the biochemical data.
  (A) The catalytic region of h−GAPDH (PDB1u8f) within the crystal structure of an
  isolated subunit shows the placement of an H2O2 juxtaposed to C156 (Cv(SH). After
  MDS, the H2O2 molecule docks forming strong bifurcated hydrogen bond donors (T153,
  H179) and strong hydrogen bond acceptors (C152 sulfenic acid and Y314) which polarize
  and activate the H2O2 molecule for nucleophilic attack by C156. The acidic protons
  contributed by H179 and C152 sulfenic acid provide a rational basis for the observed
  decline in H2O2 oxidation of C156 with rising pH (B). Following Steered Molecular
  Dynamics (SMD), the two sulfur centers are within the van der Waals contact distance
  for covalent bond formation. Formation of strong H−bonds between the C156 sulfinic
  acid acidic proton and C152 sulfinate oxygen, as well as the C152 sulfinic acid
  proton and delocalized Y314 π−orbitals promote nucleophilic attack of its sulfur
  atom on C156 sulfenic acid sulfur atom as water is an excellent leaving group. The
  model provides a rational basis for the experimental data proving directional nucleophilic
  attack resulting in a thiosulfinic acid with the sulfinyl center at C152 and the
  sulfenyl center at C156. (C). A plausible mechanistic reaction pathway for thiosulfonic
  ester formation is shown depicting a polarizing H−bond donor (T154) and acceptors
  (H179 and Y314) of a water oxygen atom at the van der Waals covalent sulfur–oxygen
  bond radius promoting hydroxyl attack on the sulfinyl sulfur center of thiosulfinic
  ester forming the thiosulfonic ester.
