caption: High glucose activates the GLUT1-OGT-HIF-1α signaling pathway leading to
  HIF-1α expression. HCT116 (A) and SW480 (B) cells were treated with 5, 15, 25, and
  35 mM. After 48 h the cytoplasmic extrusion mass was collected and the endogenous
  protein levels of GLUT1, OGT, OGA, HIF-1α-OH, HIF-1α, and β-actin were evaluated
  using antibodies and Western blotting. Relative protein expressions in HCT116 (C)
  and SW480 (D) cells are shown. Data are presented as mean  ±  SD (n  =  3; * p <
  0.05).
