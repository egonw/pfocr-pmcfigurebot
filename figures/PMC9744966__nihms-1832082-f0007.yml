caption: Loss of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) promotes cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine
  monophosphate synthase (cGAS)–stimulator of interferon genes (STING)–interferon
  regulatory factor (IRF)3/7 innate immune pathway in mouse liver. (A) Heatmap analysis
  of cGAS-STING pathway involved genes from the RNA-sequencing dataset of liver tissues
  of indicated mice fed with Gao-binge alcohol. (B) qPCR analysis of the cGAS-STING
  pathway genes in mouse liver. (C) DNA in the cytosol and whole cells was purified
  from isolated hepatocytes of liver-specific DRP1 knockout (L-DRP1 KO) and wild-type
  (WT) mice fed with Gao-binge alcohol. The relative abundance of mtDNA in the cytosol
  was quantified by qPCR using the whole-cell mtDNA content as an internal control.
  IHC staining for IRF7 (D) and immunofluorescence staining for cGAS in mouse livers
  (E). Arrows denote positive IRF7 stained nonparenchymal cells and nuclear cGAS in
  hepatocytes. The number of IRF7 positive cells were quantified (n = 3). (F) Liver
  cytosol and nuclear fractions were subjected to western blot analysis. (G) The relative
  abundance of mtDNA in serum was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
  Data are presented as means ± SEM in (B-C and G) (n = 3–4), means ± SD in (E). *p
  < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001; one-way analysis of variance analysis with Bonferroni’s
  post hoc test. EtOH, ethanol; mRNA, messenger RNA; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; qPCR,
