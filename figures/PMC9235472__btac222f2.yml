caption: The overall framework of MLGL-MP for multi-label metabolic pathway prediction.
  It is an end-to-end learning model, which contains a compound encoder, a pathway
  encoder and a multi-label predictor. The compound encoder generates compound embeddings
  based on molecular graphs by the composite of a GAT and a GCN. The pathway encoder
  generates pathway embeddings by two-layer GCNs on a pathway dependence graph, where
  nodes are pathways, node features are obtained by a pre-training strategy and edges
  are asymmetric pathway dependences. The multi-label predictor directly discriminates
  the metabolic pathways of given compounds by the proximity of pathway embeddings
  and compound embeddings
