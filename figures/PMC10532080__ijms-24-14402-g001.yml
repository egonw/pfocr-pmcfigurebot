caption: B-cell receptor-associated protein 31 (BAP31) is increased in colorectal
  cancer (CRC) cells and is associated with chemosensitivity to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).
  (A) BAP31 levels remained low in normal tissue but were elevated in cancer tissue
  in a large-scale dataset analysis using GEPIA. (B) Western blot analysis was used
  to detect BAP31 expression in CRC cancer and normal cells. (C) Western blot analysis
  of the BAP31 expression in sh-NC, sh-BAP31, and sh-BAP31+Over-BAP31 cells. (D) MTT
  assay was used to measure viability of HCT116 and SW480 cells treated with different
  concentrations of 5-FU for 48 h. (E) Colony formation ability of HCT116 and SW480
  cells treated with 5-FU. β-actin was used as loading control. * p < 0.05, ** p <
  0.01, *** p < 0.001.
