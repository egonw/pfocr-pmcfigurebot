caption: Model of how AGB1 regulates GA-related signaling pathways by controlling
  MYB62. This regulatory model shows the role of AGB1–MYB62 in regulation of the GA
  signaling pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana. AGB1 positively participates in the GA
  signaling pathway, interacts with the negative transcription factor MYB62, inhibits
  the binding of MYB62 to the promoter of GA metabolism related gene GA2ox7, and negative
  regulates GA2ox7 expression.
