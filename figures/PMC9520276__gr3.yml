caption: Liver fibrosis triggers cytosolic release of self-mtDNA in macrophages.(A)
  Heat map showing clustering of 25 downregulated genes that affect mtDNA expression
  in Xbp1M-KO BMDMs compared with Xbp1FL/FL BMDMs in response to LPS stimulation.
  (B) mtDNA was extracted as described in the Materials and methods section. Relative
  total mtDNA expression in Xbp1FL/FL and Xbp1M-KO BMDMs were determined using qPCR
  with primers specific for mtDNA (mt-Cytb, mt-Nd4) and nuclear DNA (Tert); n = 3
  biological replicates/group. (C) Relative levels of total cytosolic mtDNA in Xbp1FL/FL
  and Xbp1M-KO BMDMs treated with LPS were determined using qPCR with primers specific
  for mtDNA (D-loop) and nuclear DNA (Tert); n = 3 biological replicates/group. (D)
  Heat map showing clustering of 5 downregulated proinflammatory genes in Xbp1M-KO
  BMDMs compared with Xbp1FL/FL BMDMs in response to LPS stimulation. (E) Liver macrophages
  were isolated as described in the Materials and methods section. The mitochondrial
  membrane potential of macrophages was determined by tetramethylrhodamine methyl
  ester (TMRM) staining. (F) Mitochondrial superoxide accumulation was determined
  by measuring the MitoSOX Red fluorescence intensity in macrophages isolated from
  the different groups according to the manufacturer’s instructions; n = 3 biological
  replicates/group. (G) Enzymatic activity of MnSOD in macrophages isolated from the
  different groups was determined according to the manufacturer’s instructions; n
  = 3 biological replicates/group. (H) Cytosolic mtDNA was extracted as described
  in the Materials and methods section. Relative amounts of total cytosolic mtDNA
  in macrophages isolated from the different groups were determined using qPCR with
  primers specific for mtDNA (D-loop) and nuclear DNA (Tert); n = 3 biological replicates/group.
  (I) The mitochondrial membrane potential of Xbp1FL/FL and Xbp1M-KO BMDMs treated
  with LPS was determined by TMRM staining. (J) The levels of ROS in BMDMs were examined
  using 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) (original magnification
  200 × ). (K) Enzymatic activity of MnSOD in Xbp1FL/FL and Xbp1M-KO BMDMs treated
  with LPS was determined according to the manufacturer’s instructions; n = 3 biological
  replicates/group. (L) The levels of ROS in LPS-stimulated Xbp1FL/FL BMDMs treated
  with or without toyocamycin or tunicamycin were examined using DCFH-DA (original
  magnification 200 × ). (M) mtDNA released from mitochondria in Xbp1FL/FL and Xbp1M-KO
  BMDMs treated with LPS, as shown by confocal microscopy. Arrowheads, mtDNA released
  into cytoplasm. (N) Immunofluorescence staining of cytoplasmic dsDNA confirmed mtDNA
  depletion by EtBr. Scale bar, 20 μm. (O) Relative total mtDNA levels in LPS-stimulated
  Xbp1FL/FL and Xbp1M-KO BMDMs treated with EtBr were determined using qPCR with primers
  specific for mtDNA (D-loop) and nuclear DNA (Tert); n = 3 biological replicates/group.
  (P) Western blot was performed to analyse the levels of cGAS, STING, p-TBK1, TBK1,
  p-IRF3, IRF3, and NLRP3 in LPS-stimulated Xbp1FL/FL and Xbp1M-KO BMDMs treated with
  EtBr. The values are shown as mean ± SD. Statistical significance was assessed by
  1-way ANOVA. ∗∗p <0.01; ∗p <0.05. BMDMs, bone marrow-derived macrophages; cGAS,
  cyclic GMP-AMP synthase; EtBr, ethidium bromide; IRF3, interferon regulatory factor
  3; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MnSOD, manganese superoxide dismutase; NLRP3, nucleotide-binding

  reactive oxygen species; STING, stimulator of interferon genes; TBK1, TANK binding
  kinase 1.
