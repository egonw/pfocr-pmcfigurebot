figure_title: S100A11 knockdown suppresses the PPP in PDAC cells
caption: A GSEA indicated that S100A11 was enriched in the PPP and glutathione metabolism
  in the KEGG dataset. B TKT and TKTL1 proteins were analysed using western blotting
  in control and S100A11-knockdown PDAC cells. C–F Relative PPP flux, de novo DNA
  synthesis, cellular NADPH levels and GSH production were measured and normalised
  by cellular proteins in PDAC cells after S100A11 knockdown. *p < 0.05. Error bars
  indicate mean ± SD.
article_title: S100A11 activates the pentose phosphate pathway to induce malignant
  biological behaviour of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
