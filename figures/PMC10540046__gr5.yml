caption: Acetyltransferase Gcn5 mediates the regulation of Raptor acetylation in ZFL
  cells.A–C, the effects of Gcn5 siRNA treatment on global protein lysine acetylation
  (A), protein quantification of acetyltransferase (P300, Gcn5, and Pcaf) (B), and
  Raptor acetylation (C). Scale bars represent 5 μm. N = 3. D, the effects of gcn5
  siRNA treatment on mTORC1 activity (p-S6Ser235/236 and p-4EBPThr37/46) in ZFL cells.
  N = 3. E, the effect of gcn5 siRNA treatment on cell growth performance in ZFL cells.
  N = 3. F, the effect of CPTH6 treatment on the relative growth rate of ZFL cells.
  N = 7. Data represent mean ± SD. ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01. Gcn5, general control
  nondepressible 5; mTORC1, mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1; Pcaf, P300/Creb-binding
  protein–associated factor; ZFL, zebrafish liver.
