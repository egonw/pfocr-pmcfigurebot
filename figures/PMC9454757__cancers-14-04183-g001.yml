caption: The results of our circRNA microarray. (A) Volcano plot of differentially
  expressed circRNAs showed that the expression of 5775 and 5739 circRNAs was upregulated
  and downregulated, respectively; pale black indicates no differential expression;
  dark red indicates significantly upregulated expression, and dark green indicates
  downregulated expression with absolute FC (fold change) greater than 2 and p value
  less than 0.05; pale red shows upregulated expression, and pale green shows downregulated
  expression with absolute FC greater than 1.5 and p value less than 0.05. (B) Dysregulated
  circRNAs located on different chromosomes; the left 3D pie plot shows the location
  of significantly upregulated expression of 13 circRNAs, and the right plot shows
  the location of significantly downregulated expression of 12 circRNAs. (C–G) QRT-PCR
  of the relative expression of hsa_circRNA_0000081, hsa_circRNA_0004662, hsa_circRNA_0008586,
  hsa_circRNA_0044301, and hsa_circRNA_404289 in 61 pairs of gastric cancer tissues,
  respectively (paired sample t test was performed using the 2−ΔΔCT value of each
  pair of samples).
