caption: A) Differentiated H9C2 myotubes stained with primary anti-MyD88 and secondary
  antibody labeled with Cy3 fluorescent dye along with DAPI counterstaining. B) Area
  of myotube (Mean ± SEM) results of MyD88 in H9C2 myotube. .1 column shows the MyD88
  stained with Cy3, A.2 shows the counterstained picture of DAPI staining, and A.3
  is the merged images of both Cy3 and DAPI staining. The images of  were captured
  in 60× magnification by in cell Analyzer 2200. Whereas  shows the area of segmented
  myotubes. The dose groups were compared with control and LPS control groups by one-way
  ANOVA followed by the Dunnett t-test. Significance level were marked as *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 for the area of myotube of untreated control, LPS (1 µg/mL)
  control + PDTC (25 µM), LPS (1 µg/mL) + AA (50, 75 and 100 µM) vs. LPS treated (1 µg/mL).
