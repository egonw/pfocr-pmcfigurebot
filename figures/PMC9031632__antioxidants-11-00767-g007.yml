caption: Hemin treatment increased TLR4 expression in myeloma cells. (A–C) Western
  blot analysis of TLR4 and MAP kinase P-38 and ERK1/2 expression after hemin treatment.
  GAPDH or β-actin proteins were used as total protein loading reference. For analysis,
  the optical density of the bands was measured using Scion Image software. (D) Immunofluorescence
  of Nrf2 (green) nuclear translocation after hemin treatment. Data are expressed
  as mean MFI ± SEM of n ≥ 4 biological replicates; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p
  < 0.001.
