figure_title: Aldh1l1-eGFP/Rpl10a mice allow for isolation of astrocyte-specific ribo-associated
  mRNA
caption: 'Schematic illustrating the immunoprecipitation (IP) of astrocyte-specific
  ribo-associated mRNA from whole NAc tissue of Aldh1l1-eGFP/Rpl10a mice that express
  an eGFP tag on the ribosomal subunit RpL10a. (B) Isolated mRNA is highly specific
  for astrocytes, as revealed by a cell-type enrichment heatmap generated from plotting
  Log2CPM values of established cell-type markers from our RNA-sequencing dataset
  (alternate names: Slc1a2 = EAAT2 or Glt-1; Slc1a3 = EAAT1 or Glast; Glul = GS; Rbfox3
  = NeuN; Slc17a6 = Vglut2). Columns are the individual samples, rows are individual
  genes. Purple indicates low expression, while yelllow indicates peak expression.
  (C) Moreover, the fluorophore eGFP is expressed specifically in cells expressing
  the pan-astrocyte marker Aldh1l1, but not in cells expressing the neuronal GABA
  transporter VGAT, as determined by RNAscope; arrows indicate cells with co-expression
  of Aldh1l1 and eGFP. (D) Following RNA-seq, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis () and Metascape
  analysis () revealed the top canonical pathways and biological processes enriched
  among the top 200 expressed genes in NAc astrocytes include key metabolic and synaptic
  neurotransmission functions generally attributed to astrocytes. Notable NAc-astrocyte
  enriched processes include glycolysis and lactate synthesis, oxidative phosphorylation,
  glutamate receptor signaling, neurotransmitter uptake (e.g., glutamate), and neuroinflammation
  signaling. Red line in bar graphs indicates significance threshold of p<0.05 or
  âˆ’log10(p-value) > 1.3.'
