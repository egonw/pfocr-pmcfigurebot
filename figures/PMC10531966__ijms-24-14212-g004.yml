caption: Differential gene expression and pathway analysis between SYNE1 mutant and
  SYNE1 wild-type patients. The size of the box denotes the -log (p-value). The color
  of the boxes correlates with the z-score with the intensity of blue representing
  z < 0 and orange z > 0. Significantly different gene expression is noted for leukocyte
  migration, recruitment of leukocytes, myeloid cells, and granulocytes, and localization
  of myeloid cells. There are also significant increases in immune cell trafficking,
  inflammatory response, and humoral immune response.
