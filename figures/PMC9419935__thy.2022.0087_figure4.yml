caption: Functional link of NOTCH1 to cMYC in maintaining cancer stemness. (A) Comparison
  of mRNA expression of cMYC between normal thyroid (n = 45), PTC (n = 49), and ATC
  tissues (n = 11) in GSE33630. (B) Strong positive correlation between CDK7 and cMYC
  gene expression in the human ATC tissues (GSE33630). (C) Representative Western
  blot analysis (n = 3) showing high expression of cMyc protein in the ATC cell lines.
  (D) Representative Western blot analysis (I, n = 3) showing dose-dependent inhibition
  of RNAPII CTD phosphorylation (a–c) and cMYC (e) by THZ1 and its quantitative analyses
  (II). (E) Gene set enrichment analysis for GOBP_NOTCH signaling pathway according
  to mRNA expression of cMYC (n = 125, respectively) in TCGA-THCA. The heat map shows
  coordinated enrichment of the gene set in the representative 10 samples of each
  group. (F) Strong correlation between NOTCH1 and cMYC gene in the human ATC tissues
  (GSE33630). p-Value was calculated using Pearson correlation coefficient (n = 105).
  (G) RT-qPCR showing the simultaneous inhibition of cMYC and NOTCH1 gene in 11T (i)
  and 16T (ii) cells treated with THZ1 500 nM for 6 hours. (H) Comparison of Stemness
  Index between low and high NOTCH1 (a), or between low and high cMYC (b) tumor group
  (n = 50, respectively) in TCGA-THCA. (I) Representative IHC images (I) for cMYC
  and its quantitative analysis (II, n = 4, respectively) in monolayer-cultured cells
  and tumorspheres of 11T (a, b) and 16T (c, d) cells, respectively. Significant differences
  are indicated by asterisks (**p < 0.01 and ****p < 0.0001). Data represent mean ± SD.
  Scale bar represents 50 μm. ns, not significant.
