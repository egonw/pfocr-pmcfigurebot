caption: The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
  pathway enrichment analyses results of the intersection targets. (A) The GO enrichment
  analysis identified genes involved in the GO-cellular component analysis, GO-biological
  process analysis, and GO-molecular function analysis. (B) The KEGG pathway analysis
  based on the bioinformatics data for the molecular signal pathway of tripterine
  against connective tissue disease-related interstitial lung disease.
article_title: Connective tissue disease-related interstitial lung disease is alleviated
  by tripterine through inhibition of the PI3K/Akt, apoptosis, and TNF-Î± signalling
  pathways.
