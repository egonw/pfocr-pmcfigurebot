caption: 'BALF analysis of the effect of PSPs on the inflammatory response in ALI
  mice. (a) The total protein concentration in BALF of each group. (b) The total number
  of inflammatory cells in BALF in each group. (c) The number of neutrophils in BALF
  in each group. (d) The number of macrophages in BALF in each group. (e) IL-6 levels
  in BALF of each group. (f) TNF-α levels in BALF of each group. Compared with the
  control group, ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001; compared with the LPS group,
  #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, and ###P < 0.001.'
