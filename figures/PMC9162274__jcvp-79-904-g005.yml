caption: 'Dapagliflozin protected tubular epithelial cells through the HIF-1α/HE4/NF-κB
  signaling pathway. A, Western blot analysis of the expression of HIF-1α, HE4, P65,
  and pP65 in HK-2 cells treated with dapagliflozin and incubated hypoxia for 24 hours.
  Hypoxia increased the expression of Bax, whereas dapagliflozin decreased those of
  Bax and increased those of Bcl-2, respectively, in HK-2 cells. B, Representative
  quantitative analysis. *P< 0.01 versus the normoxia group; & P < 0.05 versus the
  dapagliflozin + hypoxia group. #P < 0.05 versus the hypoxia + pSilencer-HIF-1α group.
  There are 3 replicates in each group for cellular experiments.'
