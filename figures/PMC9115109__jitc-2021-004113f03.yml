caption: SNORA38B promoted tumor progression in C57BL/6J mice and regulated Treg infiltration.
  (A) Representative images of cytometry by time of flight analysis with 33 types
  of antibodies using PhenoGraph. Thirty-eight cells clusters are represented by different
  colors, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE)-1 and t-SNE-2 are shown.
  (B–C) Representative images and quantification of BLI in the luciferase reporter
  gene labeled SNORA38B KO/ OE LLC tumor regions in C57BL/6J mice. BLI was exmained
  every 4 days before reaching the observation endpoint. n=5 per group. (D–G) Flow
  cytometry detection of CD3+CD8+ T cells, CD4+FOXP3+ Treg and their proportion in
  leukocyte in tumors isolated from C57BL/6J mice. (H) Representative images of mIHC
  staining using human lung cancer samples with high or low SNORA38B expression. CD8,
  FOXP3, and EpCAM were shown in different colors. Bar=50 µm. n=20. (I–J) Quantification
  of CD8 and FOXP3 in mIHC staining using human lung cancer samples with high or low
  SNORA38B expression. n=20. *p<0.05,***p<0.001,****p<0.0001, means±SD was shown.
  Statistical analysis was performed by Student’s t-test and one-way analysis of variance,
  comparison between-group using LSD method. BLI, bioluminescence imaging; KO, knockout;
  mIHC, multiplex immunohistochemistry; NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer; OE, overexpress;
  SNORNA, small nucleolar RNA; TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas; Treg, regulatory T cells;
  t-SNE, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding; LSD, the Fisher Least Significant
  Difference; LLC, murine Lewis lung carcinoma.

  blockade in non-small cell lung cancer by remodeling the tumor microenvironment
  via regulation of GAB2/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
