caption: 'RhoA/ROCK1 signaling regulates Cx43 through the directly interaction between
  pMLC and Cx43. (A, C) Co-immunoprecipitation of pMLC and Cx43 in mRMVECs with or
  without high glucose. (B, D, E) The protein expression of pMLC, MLC, and Cx43 in
  mRMVECs treated with different conditions. ns, no significance. EV, empty vector.
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001 compared with the control group;
  ##P < 0.01 compared with the high glucose (30 mM) group. N = 3. The bars are the
  mean Â± SD.'
