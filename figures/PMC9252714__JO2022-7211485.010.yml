caption: Cell death through lysosome membrane disruption and UPR pathway activation.
  (a) Damage caused by the oxidative stress due to photodynamic therapy in the lysosome
  membrane releases the cathepsins D and B into the cytoplasm. Cathepsins D and B
  cleave Bid into tBid, which increases the permeability of the mitochondria membrane.
  Change in the permeability induces mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. (b) Oxidative
  stress caused due to photodynamic therapy increases misfolding of the proteins in
  the endoplasmic reticulum. When the misfolding surpasses the threshold, it triggers
  unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR activates the IRE1a receptor that binds with
  procaspase-12 to cleave procaspase-12 to caspase-12. Caspase-12 induces the cleavage
  of caspase-9 and caspase-3, which leads to mitochondria-dependent apoptosis.
