caption: The inflammatory response in CTX-induced skeletal muscle injury. (I) Infiltration
  of the immune cells. Upon injury, the immune cells are recruited into the damaged
  area, then induce inflammatory response in the damaged muscle. In this process,
  the lack of Klf2, STAT1, Hmox1, MKP-1 and upregulation of adiponectin (APN), activin
  A, and calmodulin (CaM) signaling increase, while the lack of IL-1a/β, Hsp70, CCR2,
  and IL-6/STAT3 and so on, inhibits the inflammatory infiltration. (II) Elimination
  of necrotic muscle fibers. The monocyte infiltrated into the damaged site, and become
  pro-inflammatory macrophages (M1 macrophages). M1 macrophages could secrete proinflammatory
  cytokines, maintain the inflammatory environment, then clean the necrotic debris.
  In this process, RetSat/MFG-E8 is required in the regulation of efferocytosis. ADAM8/PSGL-1
  signaling, the TAM kinase signaling pathway, and the expression of SRB1 facilitate
  the elimination of necrotic fibers. Additionally, supplementation of balenine also
  increases the phagocytosis ability of macrophages. (III) Polarization of the macrophages.
  As the clearance of the muscle debris, the pro-inflammatory macrophages switch to
  anti-inflammatory macrophages (M2 macrophages), then secrete anti-inflammatory factors
  and stimulate regeneration. TG2 deficiency and the excessive calmodulin-dependent
  signaling delay/impair, while PGC-1α, SRB1, and so on, stimulate the polarization
  of the macrophages.
