caption: α-hederin overcomes hypoxia-mediated drug resistance in colorectal cancer
  cells. (A) Effect of α-hederin on the viability of different types of cells under
  normoxia and hypoxia. (B) Colony formation assay showed the effect of α-hederin
  on the proliferation of different types of cells under normoxia and hypoxia. (C)
  BrdU experiment showed the effect of α-hederin on the proliferation of different
  types of cells under normoxia and hypoxia. Data are presented as the mean ± SD.
  Compared to control group treated with no drugs, *,#P<0.05, **,##P<0.01 vs. control
  group (0 µM).
