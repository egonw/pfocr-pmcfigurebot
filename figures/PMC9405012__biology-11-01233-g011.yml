caption: HIF-1α gene DNA methylation level and its correlation with expression. (A)
  The methylation status of the HIF-1α gene. The methylation status is represented
  by circles, in which filled circles show methylation and open circles represent
  unmethylation. The numbers above circles are the CpG dinucleotides’ locations relative
  to the start codon, and the percentages under the circles mean average methylation
  level (M ± SE) in corresponding hypoxia treatment groups. The same below (A). (B)
  The methylation level of CpG dinucleotides in different hypoxia treatment groups.
  The 0 in the abscissa represents the control group. (C) The correlation of the HIF-1α
  gene mRNA expression and overall methylation level. (D) The correlations between
  mRNA expression level and -188 CpG dinucleotides, as well as -78 CpG dinucleotides’
  methylation levels of the HIF-1α gene in different hypoxia groups. Different letters
  indicate significant differences (p < 0.05).
