caption: OGT-deficient GNPs exhibit disrupted Shh signaling pathway activation in vivo.
  (A) Schematic diagram of the experimental procedure for RNA-seq. The cerebellum
  from Ai9Atoh1 reporter Ctrl (Ctrl; Ai9) mice and OGTAtoh1; Ai9Atoh1 reporter cKO
  (OGTAtoh1 cKO; Ai9) mice at P7 were digested for FACS sorting of Ai9+ GNPs for RNA-seq
  analysis. (B) Gene ontology terms of differentially expressed genes in cKO compared
  with Ctrl mice, showing enriched signaling pathways in cKO mice. Color indicates
  the adjusted P value. The number of genes in each pathway are indicated by circle
  size. (C) Heatmap of the expression for Ptch1, Ptch2, Gli1, Gli2, Gli3, Smo, and
  Sufu genes in Shh signaling pathway. The mean expression levels in the heatmap were
  standardized by taking the z-score within each row (n = 3). The top bar indicates
  the genotypes of the samples. (D and E) Representative immunoblot showing the levels
  of proteins in the Shh signaling pathway (Ptch1, Ptch2, Gli1, Gli2, Gli3, Smo, Sufu)
  and OGT levels from Ctrl and OGThGFAP cKO mice, normalized to β-actin (D), and quantification
  (E) (n = 3). Unpaired t test. (F) X-gal staining of Gli signaling reporter in the
  sagittal section through the cerebellar vermis of Gli-LacZ Ctrl and OGThGFAP cKO
  mice at P3. (Scale bars, 500 μm and 50 μm.) a, anterior; d, dorsal; p, posterior;
  v, ventral. (G) Quantification of the relative X-gal signaling density in the EGL
  in Ctrl and OGThGFAP cKO mice at P3 (n = 3). Unpaired t test. (H) Schematic diagram
  showing altered Shh signaling pathway in OGT knockout GNPs. Down-regulated signaling
  molecules (with log2 fold-change < −0.5 and FDR < 0.05) are indicated in blue in
  the diagram. All data represent mean ± SEM **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001; n.s., no significance.
