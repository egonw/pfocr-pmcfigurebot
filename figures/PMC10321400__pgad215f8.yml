caption: 'Runx1 regulates the gene expression of factors in the IGF signaling pathway.
  A) RNA was extracted from MESC from Runx1fl/fl or Runx1d/d mice that were isolated
  on day 4 of pregnancy and grown in culture for 48 h. Gene expression analysis was
  performed using primers specific for Runx1, IGFBP4, and IGF2. 36B4 was used to normalize
  gene expression. Data shown as mean fold change ± SEM (n = 3), **P < 0.01, ***P
  < 0.001, relative to Runx1fl/fl. B) ChIP was performed on MESC isolated on day 4
  of pregnancy and grown in culture with for 48 h. Chromatin enrichment was quantified
  by qPCR and normalized to a negative control locus. Primers flanking putative Runx1-binding
  sites upstream of IGF2 and IGFBP4 transcription start sites were used to quantify
  chromatin enrichment. Region −92 kb of Myb TSS was included as a positive control
  locus. Data shown as mean fold change ± SEM (n = 3), *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, relative
  to IgG control. C) Left: Uterine sections of Runx1f/f (panel a) and Runx1d/d (panel
  b) mice on day 9 (n = 3) were subjected to IF staining with IGF2 antibody. Right:
  Immuno-positive cells for IGF2 were analyzed by ImageJ software. Asterisks indicate
  statistically significant differences *P < 0.05. Panel c indicates a negative control.
  D) Left: Dual IF staining of cytokeratin 8 (red) and IGFBP4 (green) is shown in
  Runx1f/f and Runx1d/d decidua on day 10 of pregnancy. Extensive trophoblast (red)
  invasion is evident in Runx1f/f decidua. An elevated decidual IGFBP4 expression
  (green) is observed in Runx1d/d decidua (Right). Right: Immuno-positive cells for
  IGFBP4 were analyzed by ImageJ software. Asterisks indicate statistically significant
  differences *P < 0.05.'
