  Blood and Lungs
caption: '(a) Scheme of the later portion of the complement cascade pathway and downstream
  signaling. Maroon boxes indicate complement proteins that were positive hits in
  our glycoproteomic analysis in . (b) Differential α2,6-sialylation of complement
  C5 and C9 in three patient groups. Western blot (anti-C5 and anti-C9) of SNA pulldown
  samples from pooled patient plasma with corresponding input is shown. Intensity
  ratios of pulldown/input bands are depicted in the bar plot. (c) Analysis of individual
  per patient paired ratio of ST6GAL1 to C5 mRNA expression in whole blood of healthy
  controls (n = 19) or those with seasonal coronavirus (n = 59), or COVID-19 (n =
  46), from publicly available dataset Gene Expression Omnibus: GSE161731. Student’s
  t-test was used to determine p-values. ns: p ≥ 0.05; *: p < 0.05. (d) Representative
  images of IHC staining against C5b, C9, ST6GAL1 or Pan-Cytokeratin in the lower
  lobe of the lungs in COVID-19 negative (n = 2) (top) or COVID-19 positive (n = 8)
  (bottom) autopsy specimens. Scale bars represent 75 μm.'
