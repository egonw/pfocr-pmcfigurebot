figure_title: Representation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in Non-Small Cell Lung
  Cancer (NSCLC), where AKT has been found to mediate a variety of cellular processes
  required by tumor cells for survival, including protein synthesis, glucose metabolism,
  cell cycle progression, anti-apoptosis, tumor cell angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis
  activity for survival, proliferation, metastasis, and invasion
caption: Indirectly, AKT has been found to affect the tumor suppressor function of
  p53.
article_title: Deciphering miR-520c-3p as a probable target for immunometabolism in
  non-small cell lung cancer using systems biology approach.
