caption: 'The gene expression profiles of PALB2-mutated spheroids have widely changed,
  and they associate with multiple cancer-related functions. a Principal component
  analysis of transcriptome data processed with DeSeq2 differential gene expression
  analysis showing deviation of the PALB2-mutated cell lines from the control ones.
  b Heat map plot of genes with a significant q-value (< 0.05) for the gene expression
  difference between PALB2-mutated and control cell lines. c Venn diagram of differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) (q < 0.05) in #BiAll-93 and #MonoAll-2.13 spheroids compared
  to their isogenic control cell lines. d and e Clustering of the filtered DEGs (|L2fc
  |> 0.8) in #BiAll-93 cells (d), and with down- and up-regulated DEGs separately,
  as well as #MonoAll-2.13 cells (e) by STRING analysis package. Protein products
  have been colored with symbols according to the biological processes they are related
  to: cell cycle processes (red), chromosome organization (blue), response to stress
  (green), cell adhesion (yellow), regulation of cell population proliferation (magenta),
  and developmental processes (turqoise). Clustered genes that do not belong to any
  of the above-mentioned biological processes have a white symbol. Disconnected nodes
  have been hidden in the network. Down- and up-regulated DEGs have been scaled down
  in comparison to the combined analysis. f Four out of six important biological processes
  that have changed in #BiAll-93 are also altered in #MonoAll-2.13. The three most
  significant and independent processes according to STRING analysis have been listed
  separately for #BiAll-93 and #MonoAll-2.13 cell lines. N/A, non applicable. g and
  h Selected top diseases and functions related to DEGs in #BiAll-93 (g) and #MonoAll-2.13
  (h) spheroids, according to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). The complete lists
  are shown in Supplementary Table 5. f–h False discovery rate p-values have been
  corrected using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure. Dashed line in g and h indicates
  the threshold for a significant B–H p-value < 0.05 [− log(B–H p-value) > 1.3]'
