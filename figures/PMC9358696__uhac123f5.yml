caption: DE and DAS analyses of pakchoi response to heat stress. (A) Flow chart showing
  the distribution of the 17 771 DE and 650 DAS genes. The DE and DAS gene sets differ
  markedly, with only 432 genes in common. (B) Classification of gene expression heat
  map of responsive HSPs under heat stress. (C) Distribution of the responsive AS
  events that generate nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) in two cultivars. (D) Exon–intron
  structure of representative transcripts of four AS genes. (E) The colored bar graphs
  represent the inclusion/exclusion ratio of the IR events of DAS genes as identified
  from RNA-seq and RT–qPCR. (F) Model of the heat-responsive pathway and genome-wide
  transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation.
article_title: The reference genome and full-length transcriptome of pakchoi provide
  insights into cuticle formation and heat adaption.
