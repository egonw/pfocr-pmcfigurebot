caption: Biological processes that are enriched in patients with long PFS, their interaction,
  and shared components (e.g., One-carbon metabolism, BCAA biosynthesis, and TCA cycle)
  between gut microbiota and host cells (e.g., T cells). Methanogenesis generates
  serine, which enters one-carbon metabolism, and lysine, which enters the aspartate
  pathway. The aspartate pathway produces methionine which enters the methionine cycle
  of one-carbon metabolism. In addition, along with BCAA biosynthesis, it generates
  isoleucine that feeds the TCA cycle. BCAA biosynthesis pathway also produces valine
  and leucine that enter the TCA cycle. Finally, NADH/NADPH connect one-carbon metabolism,
  TCA cycle, and BCAA biosynthesis pathwayâ€”three important biological processes that
  are shared by host cells, including immune cells such as CTLs. These pathways can
  integrate metabolites/metabolic intermediates directly from gut microbiota, such
  as NADPH, serine, methionine, etc., and prime CTLs to respond better to ICIs in
  cancer immunotherapy.
