caption: The combination of Met+FK activates the p53 pathway and the unfolded protein
  response (UPR). (A) p53 gene set that overlaps with gene expression changes in KP4
  cells treated with metformin and FK866 in comparison to vehicle, metformin alone,
  or FK866 alone. (B) UPR gene set that overlaps with gene expression changes in KP4
  cells treated with metformin and FK866 in comparison to vehicle, metformin alone,
  or FK866 alone. (C) RT-qPCR validation of some gene expression differences found
  in (A) and (B). Data are normalized over TBP and HMBS and presented as means relative
  to control cells (vehicle condition). Values are means of triplicates ± SEM. * p-value
  ≤ 0.05, ** p-value ≤ 0.01, *** p-value ≤ 0.001, **** p-value ≤ 0.0001 (ANOVA), n
  = 3.
