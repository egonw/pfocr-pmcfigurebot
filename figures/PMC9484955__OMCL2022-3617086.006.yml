caption: Mitochondrial autophagy dominated mitochondrial quality control and intracellular
  environmental homeostasis. Interaction of receptor-mediated and non-receptor-mediated
  mitophagy with cellular homeostasis. In conditions causing mitochondrial stress,
  the mitochondrial fission kinesins Drp1 and Fis1 mediated mitochondrial fission.
  Additionally, the expression of Opa1 and Mfn1/2 decreased, the Opa1- and Mfn1/2-mediated
  mitochondrial fusion decreased, and the mitochondrial fragmentation increased the
  level of chemistry. Elevated levels of mitochondrial fragmentation led to insufficient
  mitochondrial ATP production, increased dysfunctional and incomplete mitochondria,
  activation of receptor-dependent mitophagy mediated by FUNDC1 and BNIP3, and activation
  of PINK/Parkin-mediated nonreceptor mitochondrial autophagy. Body-dependent mitophagy
  levels were also activated; however, neither autophagy pathway could completely
  eliminate or digest the incomplete mitochondrial debris. The intervention of mitophagy-targeted
  drugs or activators/inhibitors led to inhibition of Drp1 and Fis1 and increases
  of Opa1 and Mfn1/2 expression. Mitochondrial fission was also excessively inhibited,
  and mitochondrial fusion was activated. In a balanced state of mitochondrial fusion
  and fission, the level of mitochondrial fragmentation decreases. The receptor-dependent
  mitophagy mediated by FUNDC1 and BNIP3 and receptor-independent mitophagy mediated
  by PINK/Parkin can clear or degrade mitochondria, maintain mitochondrial and cellular
  homeostasis, and protect cardiomyocytes. Mitophagy is transiently activated in mouse
  myocardial injury and downregulated in response to stress overload. Mitophagy plays
  key roles in mediating mitochondrial dysfunction and heart failure development.
  Restoration of mitophagy alleviates cardiac dysfunction during stress overload.
  During cardiac decompensation, pathological remodeling of the myocardium is associated
  with Drp1-mediated mitophagy. An insufficient level of mitophagy also accelerates
  the process of decompensation and promotes heart failure progression. This may be
  closely related to mitochondrial fusion/fission.
