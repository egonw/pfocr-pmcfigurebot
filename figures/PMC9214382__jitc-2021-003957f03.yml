caption: 'The inhibitory effects of L-5-HTP on IFN-γ stimulated PD-L1 induction are
  mediated by reduced expression of RTK ligands and suppression of the downstream
  RTK receptors/MEK/ERK/c-JUN signaling cascade. (A) PD-L1 mRNA expression level was
  determined by qPCR analysis of IFN-γ stimulated BXPC3 cells treated with different
  concentrations L-5-HTP for different time as indicated. (B) Green: gene set of IFN-γ
  induced genes (upregulated compared with the DMSO group). Blue: genes downregulated
  in the IFN-γ+5 HTP group compared with IFN-γ group. Venn diagram showing that among
  the IFN-γ induced upregulated genes, 672 genes were subsequently downregulated on
  treatment with L-5-HTP. These 672 genes were subjected to KEGG pathway analysis,
  and the top 20 most significantly enriched pathways are shown. (C) BXPC3 cells were
  treated with IFN-γ and L-5-HTP for different time (1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, and
  24 hours), and then ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2, c-JUN, p-c-JUN, PD-L1, and GAPDH expression
  was analyzed by western blot. (D) Quantification of western blot results for p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2,
  p-c-JUN/c-JUN, and PD-L1 shown in figure part C. Relative fold change in expression
  levels of p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2, p-c-JUN/c-JUN, and PD-L1 were normalized to the DMSO
  group. (E) Heat map showing the 20 most significantly downregulated genes in the
  MAPK pathway. RTK ligands are highlighted in red. qPCR analysis was conducted to
  validate the repression of RTK ligands. BXPC3 cells were treated with IFN-γ and
  different concentrations of L-5-HTP for 24 hours. (F) BXPC3 cells were treated with
  DMSO, IFN-γ (500 IU/mL), IFN-γ+L-5-HTP (10 µM), IFN-γ+HGF (100 ng/mL), IFN-γ+HGF+L-5-HTP,
  IFN-γ+AREG (100 ng/mL), or IFN-γ+AREG + L-5-HTP for 24 hours. PD-L1 mRNA expression
  under the indicated treatments was determined by qPCR analysis. (G) ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2,
  c-JUN, p-c-JUN, PD-L1, and GAPDH levels under the indicated treatments for 24h were
  determined by western blot analysis. (H) Quantification of western blot results
  for p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2, p-c-JUN/c-JUN, and PD-L1 shown in figure part G. Relative fold
  changes in expression levels of p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2, p-c-JUN/c-JUN, and PD-L1 were normalized
  to the DMSO group (n=3 independent experiments). Data are shown as mean±SD; ns;
  p>0.05; *p<0.05; **p<0.01; ***p<0.001; and ****p<0.0001 versus IFN-γ group. L-5-HTP,
  5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan; ns, not significant; PD-L1, programmed death ligand-1.'
