caption: Prediction and detection of PTEN being a target gene of miR-124-3p. (a) Prediction
  results of PTEN for miR-124-3p via STARBASE database. (b) The relative luciferase
  activity illustration using double luciferase assay. PTEN expression in both model
  and Sham groups were detected by western blot (c) and qPCR (d), respectively. (e)
  Detection of PTEN, P-P13K, and P-AKT expression by western blot after overexpression
  and inhibition of miR-124-3p.
