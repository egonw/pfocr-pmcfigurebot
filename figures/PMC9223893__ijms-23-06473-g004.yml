caption: Anti-tumor immunity is boosted in patients with higher RvD scores. (A) IPA
  findings of biological functions associated with higher resolution scores. The most
  significantly affected molecular, cellular and biological functions and their relative
  p-value in patients with higher versus lower resolution scores are shown. (B) Activation
  z-score of biological functions related to cell movement. Each square reports the
  activation z-score (color legend is reported in the inset, sized by -log p-value)
  for the described biological functions. (C) Activation z-score of biological functions
  related to activation. Each square reports the activation z-score (color legend
  is reported in the inset, sized by -log p value) for the described biological functions.
  (D) Predicted tumor infiltration of 10 human immune subsets in HNSC samples with
  a high (n = 100) or low (n = 100) RvD score, as inferred by CIBERSORT. * p < 0.05;
  ***, p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA and Sidakâ€™s multiple comparisons
  test. (E,F) Differentially expressed genes and significantly associated biological
  functions (Fx) related to activation (E) and response (F) of leukocytes.
