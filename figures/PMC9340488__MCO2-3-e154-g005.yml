caption: 'Toll‐like receptor signaling pathway in COVID‐19. TLR2/6 and TLR4 are located
  on the cell membrane, while TLR3, TLR7/8, and TLR9 are located on the endosome surface.
  TLRs recognize invading pathogens by sensing PAMP and activate the regulation of
  host innate immunity and cytokines. TLR activation leads to the production of proinflammatory
  cytokines and I IFN through its major downstream proteins MYS88 and TRIF. The S
  protein of SARS‐CoV‐2 activates TLR2 and TLR4; TLR3 senses intracellular viral dsRNA;
  TLR7/8 recognizes viral ssRNA; and TLR9 senses mtDNA damage caused by viral infection.
  Activated TLR regulates the production of proinflammatory factors through a series
  of signaling in the NF‐κB pathway and activates IRF3/7 to produce I IFN. The figure
  is drawn by BioRender software. Abbreviations: dsRNA, double‐strand RNA; I IFN,
  type 1 interferon; IRAK4, interleukin‐1 receptor‐associated kinase 4; mtDNA, mitochondrial
  DNA; MYD88, myeloid differentiation primary response 88; NF‐κB, nuclear factor‐kappaB;
  ssRNA, single‐strand RNA; TRAF, tumor necrosis factor receptor‐associated factor;
  TRIF, TIR‐domain‐containing adapter‐inducing interferon‐β'
