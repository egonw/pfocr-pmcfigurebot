caption: The Toxoplasma gondii functional homolog of SufC.A, schematic representation
  of the molecular machinery for Fe-S cluster synthesis in the apicoplast of T. gondii
  (see main text for details). B, alignment of the predicted amino acid sequence of
  TgSUFC and its homolog from Escherichia coli. Motifs that are potentially important
  for ATPase activity are outlined in blue. C, functional complementation of bacterial
  mutants for SufC. Growth of WT E. coli K12 parental strain, the SufC mutant strain
  and the mutant strain complemented (‘comp’) by the T. gondii homolog, was assessed
  by monitoring the optical density at 600 nm in the presence or not of an iron chelator
  (2,2′-bipyridyl, ‘chel’). Values are mean from n = 3 independent experiments ±SD.
  Two-tailed Student’s t test p-values are indicated, when comparing values obtained
  with various concentrations of chelator for the mutant cell line versus the complemented
  one.
