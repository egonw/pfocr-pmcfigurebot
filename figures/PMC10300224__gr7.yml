caption: 'Fatty acid metabolism(A) Heatmap of concentrations of saturated and mono-unsaturated
  long-chain free fatty acids (SFA/MUFA), poly-unsaturated long-chain free fatty acids
  (PUFA), and short- and medium-chain free fatty acids (SCFA/MCFA) in the serum (hepatic
  input) and liver of the SG and IF-CR groups, expressed as log2 of the fold-change
  versus the AL group. (∗ - ANOVA FDR <0.05 in serum or liver).(B) Serum lipid profile
  showing increased triglyceride (TG) concentrations in the IF-CR group, as well as
  decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels in the SG group and
  no change in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels.(C) Serum concentrations
  (area under the curve [AUC] normalized to total ion count [TIC]) of the major ketone
  bodies, acetoacetate (AcAc) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB), showing a decrease
  in the IF-CR group.(E) Heatmaps of relative transcript abundance of significantly
  altered genes (ANOVA FDR <0.05) in pathways of fatty acid (FA) oxidation and synthesis,
  glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle, expressed as log2 of the fold-change versus the AL group, and
  showing upregulation of FA synthesis in the IF-CR group.(F) Liver concentrations
  of glycolytic/gluconeogenic intermediates (AUC normalized to TIC, expressed as standardized
  z-scores) (G6P: glucose 6-phosphate; F6P: fructose 6-phosphate; GA3P: glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate; DHAP: dihydroxyacetone phosphate; PEP: phosphoenol pyruvate; Pyr: pyruvate).(G)
  plot summarizing changes in fatty acid metabolism pathways, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis,
  pentose phosphate pathway, and TCA cycle. In red, metabolites or transcripts upregulated
  in the IF-CR group. In blue, metabolites or transcripts down regulated in the IF-CR
  group. In purple, long-chain FAs – downregulated in serum and upregulated in the
  liver of the IF-CR group.∗p < 0.05 ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test.∗∗p < 0.01 ANOVA
  with Tukey post-hoc test.'
