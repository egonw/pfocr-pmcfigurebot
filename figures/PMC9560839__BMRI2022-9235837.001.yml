caption: 'The expression of SOX8, Notch4, and Hes5 in samples of prostate cancer (PCa)
  and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
  for the progression-free survival (PFS) of 35 patients with CRPC. (a–c) The expression
  levels of SOX8, Notch4, and Hes5 were detected by immunohistochemistry (×200). (d–f)
  Average staining scores for SOX8, Notch4, and Hes5 in PCa and CRPC samples. According
  to staining intensity, samples were divided as follows: 0, no staining; 1, weak
  staining; 2, light staining; 3, moderate staining; and 4, strong staining. Staining
  scores ≤ 1 were defined as having a negative expression, while staining scores of
  ≥2 were defined as having a positive expression. (g, h) The correlation curve between
  SOX8 staining scores versus Notch4 or Hes5 staining scores in CRPC tissues. (i–k)
  Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to assess the relationship between PFS and
  the expression of SOX8, Notch4, and Hes5 in patients with CRPC. P < 0.05 was considered
  to be statistically different.'
