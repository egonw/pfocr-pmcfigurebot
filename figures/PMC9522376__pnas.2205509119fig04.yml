caption: CDK12 alteration associates with hyperactivation of the AR signaling pathway
  and IPA usage in the AR gene locus in patient samples. (A and B) Comparison of RNA-seq
  reads in the IPA sites in intron 3 of the CSTF3 (A) and AR (B) genes between CDK12
  WT (n = 487) and deficient (n = 12) PCa patient samples in the TCGA cohort. RPKM,
  reads per kilobase of transcript, per million mapped reads. ***P < 0.001. (C) Comparison
  of AR score (Materials and Methods) between CDK12 WT (n = 487) and deficient (n
  = 12) PCa patient samples from the TCGA cohort. *P < 0.05. (D) Progression-free
  survival (PFS) analysis between CDK12 WT (n = 487) and deficient (n = 12) PCa patient
  samples from the TCGA cohort. (E and F) OS analysis between CDK12 WT and deficient
  patient samples of the SU2C (E; n = 310 versus 15) or WCDT cohort (F; n = 95 versus
  3). (G and H) Comparison of AR score (Materials and Methods) between CDK12 WT and
  deficient patient samples of the SU2C (G; n = 310 versus 15) or WCDT cohort (H;
  n = 95 versus 3). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
