caption: Integrated Analysis of Gene Expression with IR states in PCOS. (A & B) Display
  DEG heatmaps for datasets GSE80432 and GSE155489, highlighting differential expression
  between PCOS and controls, identifying potential biomarkers. (C) Features a Venn
  diagram merging “darkred” module genes from WGCNA with DEGs, isolating key genes
  linked to IR in PCOS. (D & E) Present expression heatmaps for lncRNAs and miRNAs
  in GSE138518 and GSE138572, revealing regulatory non-coding RNA changes in PCOS.
  (F) Box plots of 13 genes showcase distinct expression levels in PCOS versus controls,
  pinpointing IR-related genes. (G) Offers GO and KEGG pathway analyses, elucidating
  the biological impact of these genes in PCOS.
