caption: 'Expression analysis of DEGs enriched in the lignin biosynthesis pathway.
  (A): DEGs enriched in the lignin biosynthesis pathway in C. vietnamensis leaves.
  (B): Heatmap of lignin biosynthesis-related gene expression. PAL, phenylalanine
  ammonia-lyase; C4H, trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase; 4CL, 4-coumaric acid: CoA ligase;
  CCR, cinnamoyl CoA reductase; CAD, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase; POD, peroxidase;
  COMT, caffeate 3-O-methyltransferase; CCoAOMT, caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase;
  F5H, ferulate 5-hydroxylase; REF1, coniferyl-aldehyde dehydrogenase. Values are
  the average FPKM value of each sample in each group. Genes in red or blue refer
  to up- or downregulation responding to drought, respectively.'
