caption: H&E-stained sections showing histopathological changes in liver tissue of
  all research groups. (A) Control group showing normal hepatic architecture formed
  of cords of acidophilic hepatocytes with uniform nuclei (arrow) radiating from the
  central vein (C.V), separated by blood sinusoids (S). (B) DEN group showing lost
  architecture with focal necrosis and hyalinosis (stars), atypical pleomorphic hepatocytes
  (arrows) with pleomorphic hyperchromatic nuclei and distinct nucleoli (arrowheads),
  markedly vacuolated cytoplasm (V), and dilated sinusoids (S). (C) DEN group showing
  large nodule with central necrosis (arrow), marked inflammatory infiltrates (arrowheads),
  and dilated central vein (C.V). A pseudo-glandular pattern can be noticed (rectangle).
  (D) n-3 PUFAs group showing nearly normal liver architecture with regular hepatocytes’
  cords except for mildly dilated sinusoids (S) and congested central vein (C.V).
  (magnification A,B,D × 200, C × 100).
