caption: The effects of HMGA2 on brain injury induced apoptosis. (a) Analysis of cellular
  apoptosis ratio on cerebral infarction rats that transfected with sh-HMGA2 or sh-NC.
  (b) Western blot was used to explore the protein expression level of apoptosis related
  protein after cerebral infarction. ∗∗p < 0.01 vs. sham or MCAO + sh-NC. Data are
  expressed as mean ± SEM.
