caption: Tpz-1 interferes with Src and MAP pathway signaling in HL-60 cells after
  3 h of exposure. Cellular extracts from cells exposed to 0.01 μM Tpz-1, 0.1 μM Tpz-1,
  or 0.2% v/v DMSO were analyzed for changes in kinase phosphorylation via antibody/bead-based
  Luminex xMAP technology. The y-axis indicates median fluorescence intensity (MFI)
  and error bars represent the standard deviations of the average of two technical
  replicates. Decreased MFI, implying kinase hypophosphorylation was evident in p38
  (0.01 µM p = 0.034225; 0.1 µM p = 0.009669), CREB (0.01 µM p = 0.043251; 0.1 µM
  p = 0.004603), Akt (0.01 µM p = 0.035648; 0.1 µM p = 0.002076), and STAT3 (0.01
  µM p = 0.037819; 0.1 µM p = 0.00785); whereas increased MFI, implying hyperphosphorylation
  was observed in Fgr (0.01 µM p = 0.033102; 0.1 µM p = 0.014181), Hck (0.1 µM p =
  0.0426), and ERK 1/2 (0.01 µM p = 0.024866, 0.1 µM p = 0.020551). Statistical analysis
  was achieved by two-tailed Student’s paired t-test, and the asterisk annotations
  in each graph represent statistical significance of the treatments against the vehicle
  control; (*) p < 0.05, (**) p < 0.01. Data acquisition and analysis was achieved
  via xPONENT 3.1 software (Luminex, Austin, TX, USA).
