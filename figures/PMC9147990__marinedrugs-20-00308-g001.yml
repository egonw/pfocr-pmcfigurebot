caption: Cell viability in PWG-treated HDFs. HDFs were treated with different concentrations
  of PWG and incubated for 24 h. After incubation, MTT assay was performed to measure
  cell viability of PWG. All data were indicated as mean ± SD of at least three independent
  experiments. ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001 versus normal.
