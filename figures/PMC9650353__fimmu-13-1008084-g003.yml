caption: Analysis of DE miRNAs and their regulatory pathway. (A) The Gene Ontology
  (GO) analysis for the enriched functions of genes regulated by the host DE miRNAs
  induced by viral infection. The top 30 molecular function-related GO enrichment
  terms of target genes are shown. Terms with adjusted P ≤ 0.05 are recognized as
  significantly enriched GO terms. (B) The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
  (KEGG) analysis of target genes significantly regulated by DE miRNAs in Vero cells
  infected with SARS-CoV-2 6 hpi/12 hpi vs. controls (n=2). (C) The regulatory network
  of both up-regulated and down-regulated human miRNA and their target genes enriched
  in KEGG pathways. The red triangle nodes represent the miRNAs. The red dots are
  genes specifically regulating PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, yellows are genes specifically
  regulating MAPK signaling pathway, greens are genes in both pathways, and genes
  in other pathways are presented in blue.
