caption: Cytoskeletal elements regulate PI3K/AKT signaling cascade. The three types
  of cytoskeleton collectively control the PI3K/AKT pathway. The cytoskeleton and
  its associated proteins play critical roles in regulating multiple steps and players
  of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, including signaling molecule recruitment, antagonist
  sequestration, and regulation of gene expression. Image created with BioRender.com
