caption: FGFR inhibition suppressed the transcription level of HK2 gene via mTOR pathway.
  A, Western blot analysis on glucose metabolism-related proteins in NCI-H1581 cells
  with AZD4547 treatment (0.1 µM) for 24 h. β-Actin and GAPDH were used as the loading
  controls. B-F, Western blot analysis on protein levels of HK2 and FGFR signalings
  (p-FGFR or p-FRS2) with FGFR inhibitors treatment as indicated for 24 h in NCI-H1581
  (B), NCI-H716 (C), RT112 (D), Hep3B (E) and NCI-H2444 (F) cells. GAPDH was used
  as the loading control. G, Western blot analysis on protein levels of HK2 and AKT/mTOR
  signalings with AKT inhibitor MK2206 (1 μM) or mTOR inhibitor AZD8055 (0.1 μM) for
  24 h in NCI-H1581 and NCI-H716 cells. β-Actin was used as the loading control. H,
  18F-FDG uptake by NCI-H1581 cells treated with AZD8055 or MK2206 for 24 h. I, Western
  blot analysis on protein levels of HK2 and PLCγ signalings in NCI-H1581 cells transiently
  transfected with two siRNAs targeting PLCγ (S1 and S2) or siRNA control (NC) for
  48 h. β3-Tubulin was used as the loading control. J, Western blot analysis on protein
  levels of HK2 and MEK signalings with MEK1/2 inhibitor PD0325901 (1 μM) for 24 h
  in NCI-H1581 and NCI-H716 cells. GAPDH was used as the loading control. K, Western
  blot analysis on HK2 protein levels in NCI-H1581 and NCI-H716 cells with AZD4547
  treatment (0.1 μM for NCI-H1581 cells, and 0.05 μM for NCI-H716 cells) for 24 h.
  MG132 (10 μM, upper panel) or Leupeptin (10 μM, lower panel) was added 6 h before
  sample collection. β-Actin and GAPDH were used as the loading controls. L, Quantitative
  RT-PCR analysis for mRNA levels of HK2 gene at the indicated time points in NCI-H1581
  (left panel), NCI-H716 (middle panel) and NCI-H2444 cells (right panel) with AZD4547
  or Erdafitinib treatment. Cells without treatment (0 h) were used as the normalization
  controls. M, Western blot analysis on protein levels of HK2 and FGFR signalings
  at the indicated time points in NCI-H1581 (upper panel) and NCI-H716 cells (lower
  panel) with AZD4547 treatment. β-Actin was used as the loading control. Data were
  shown as mean ± SD. **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001; ns, p ≥ 0.05. Relative band intensity
  of target protein was normalized to its corresponding loading control as fold of
  the vehicle-, or control-, or non-treated group.
