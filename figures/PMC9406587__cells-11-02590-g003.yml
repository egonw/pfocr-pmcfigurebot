caption: The unfolded protein response (UPR) and the integrated stress response (ISR).
  The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER leads to ER stress, which triggers
  intracellular stress sensors (UPR and/or ISR sensors) that can activate stress response
  pathways to maintain ER homeostasis. However, an excessive unresolved or chronic
  ER stress can trigger apoptosis responses leading to a different cell fate. The
  UPR sensors (PERK, IRE1α and ATF6) reside in the ER membrane, while ISR sensors
  (i.e., PKR, GCN2 and HRI) are cytoplasmic kinases that respond to different stressors
  than those of the UPR. The UPR and ISR pathways converge at the PERK sensor which,
  after its dimerization, halts global translation by phosphorylating eIF2α on Ser51.
  The IRE1α features a cytoplasmic kinase domain and RNase domain; upon dimerization
  and auto-phosphorylation, IRE1α induces its kinase and endoribonuclease activities,
  leading to unconventional splicing of X-box-binding protein-1 (XBP1) mRNA []. In
  this regard, RACK1 (receptor for activated C kinase 1) has been reported to activate
  IRE1α-XBP1 signaling pathway and induce neuroprotection in rat models [], and the
  IRE1α-RACK1 axis has been shown to orchestrate cytoprotective responses after ER
  stress []. The ATF6 has a cytoplasmic domain which, upon ER stress, is processed
  in the Golgi apparatus, and an ATF6 fragment is released in the cytoplasm. After
  its activation, the UPR pathway induces central transcription factors ATF6, XBP1,
  and ATF4 that are redirected to the nucleus to mediate the expression of UPR downstream
  targets [].
