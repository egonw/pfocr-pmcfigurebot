caption: Prevention of CBDS recurrence by regulating the “gut-liver-bile acid” axis
  in Chinese medicine. Bile acids subjected to bacterial BSH and HSDH are reabsorbed
  by intestinal cells, and upon binding to FXR in hepatic cells, they affect the classical
  pathway in the bile acid synthesis pathway by activating the heterodimeric chaperone
  SHP, which in turn blocks the normal transcription of the CYP7A1 enzyme. Binding
  to FXR also reduces the concentration of effective bile acids by releasing FGF15/19
  to form a heterodimeric complex with FGFR and β-Klotho, which in turn affects the
  normal transcription of CYP7A1 leading to an abnormality in the pathway of bile
  acid synthesis.
