caption: 'Signalling pathways involved in holoprosencephaly. (a) SHH signaling pathway.
  (b) BMP antagonists TSG/CHD/NOG suppress the activation of BMP downstream effectors.
  (c) Nodal signaling leads to the phosphorylation of smad2/3, which translocates
  to the nucleus, where it is thought to interact with ZIC2 and regulate SHH expression.
  (d) FGF signaling maintains SHH expression. Abbreviations: SHH, Sonic hedgehog;
  GLI1-3, glioma-associated oncogene homolog; PTCH1, Patched1; SMO, Smoothened; SUFU,
  Suppressor of fused homolog; KIF7, Kinesin family member 7; TSG, Twisted gastrulation;
  CHD, Chordin; NOG, Noggin; BMP, Bone morphogenic protein; P, Phosphate; SMAD, Mothers
  against decapentaplegic homolog; NODAL, Nodal growth differentiation factor; ZIC2,
  Zinc finger protein 2; SIX3, SIX homeobox 3; FGF/FGFR1, Fibroblast growth factor/receptor
  1.'
