caption: miR-146a-5p downregulation promotes the progression of pancreatitis via the
  TLR9/TRAF6/NLRP3 signaling pathway. (a–c) ELISA detected the levels of inflammatory
  factors in the culture medium. (d) The CCK8 assay detected proliferation. (e) FCM
  detected cell death. (f) Western blot detected the levels of TRAF6, TLR9, ASC, NLRP3,
  pro-caspase-1, cleaved-caspase-1 and GSDMD. Band analysis software is ImageJ (version
  1.8.0_172). ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001. The experiments were repeated
  three times, the statistical test was a two-tailed test, and errors bars in the
  figures represent standard deviation (SD).
