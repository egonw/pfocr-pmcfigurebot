figure_title: Gene modulation by single-agent or combination treatments in a KRASG12C–driven
  colorectal cancer (CRC) xenograft model
caption: 'All treatments in SW837 xenograft models were administered over seven consecutive
  days.a, Overlap of up-regulated (left) or down-regulated (right) genes in tumors
  from SW837 xenograft models across three time points after receiving one of these
  treatments: 50 mg/kg bid, p.o. BI-3406 (BI); 20 mg/kg twice a week, i.p. cetuximab
  (Cet); 100 mg/kg qd, p.o. adagrasib (Ada); 50 mg/kg BI-3406 plus 100 mg/kg adagrasib
  (BI + Ada); 20 mg/kg cetuximab plus 100 mg/kg adagrasib (Cet + Ada). Samples were
  collected at 4, 24, and 48 hours after the last dose. n = 4–5 animals/groups. b,
  Modulation of overall MAPK pathway activity, as indicated by the MAPK Pathway Activity
  Score (MPAS), in tumors from SW837 xenograft models treated with indicated single-agent
  or combination treatments. Samples were collected at 4, 24 and 48 hours after the
  last dose. N=4–5/group. Boxplots show low and upper quartiles and median line is
  indicates. Whiskers: 1.5 x interquartile range. Data analyzed by two-sided Wilcoxon
  rank sum test. c, Differential modulation of select MAPK pathway genes in tumors
  from SW837 xenograft models treated with indicated single-agent or combination treatments.
  Samples were collected at 4, 24, or 48 hours post last dose. N=4–5/group'
