caption: Global transcriptome changes between PR and PD patients before and after
  treatment. A Heatmap showing DEGs between PR and PD patients prior to PD-1 monoclonal
  antibody treatment. B, C GO analysis of upregulated (b) and downregulated (c) genes
  between PR and PD patients before treatment. D Pathway analysis of downregulated
  genes between PR and PD patients before treatment. E–F Volcano plots of DEGs in
  PR (e) and PD patients (f) after treatment. P < 0.05, log2FC > 1. G Venn diagram
  showing 866 PR patient’s special DEGs and 4 oppositely regulated DEGs in PR and
  PD patients after treatment, which add up to a changing-fate gene set. H, I Top
  20 pathways and KEGG analysis of changing-fate gene set. J, K GO and DO analysis
  of changing-fate gene set
