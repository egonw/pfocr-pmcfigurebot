figure_title: PDZK1 decreases EGFR levels and EGFR-mediated signalling in TNBC via
  interaction with EGFR
caption: 'A PDZK1 expression was negatively associated with EGFR signalling activation
  in TNBC. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) profile of the “KOBAYASHI_EGFR_SIGNALING_24HR_DN”
  gene signature (source: https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/) for PDZK1 level.
  According to the median value of the TCGA dataset, the samples were divided into
  PDZK1 high/low expression group. NES: Normalised Enrichment Score, FDR: False Discovery
  Rate. B, C PDZK1 expression was negatively correlated with EGFR expression and pERK
  level in TNBC. The expression levels were derived from IHC results of TMA. Data
  were analysed by Pearson correlation. D, E PDZK1 overexpression decreased EGFR expression
  and EGFR-mediated signalling in TNBC cells with/out EGF stimulation. F PDZK1 decreased
  EGFR expression in a dose-dependent manner. G, H PDZK1 knockdown enhanced EGFR expression
  and EGFR-mediated signalling in TNBC cells with/out EGF induction. I, J PDZK1 knockdown
  enhanced EGFR expression and EGFR-mediated signalling in vivo. Data were presented
  as mean ± SD with n = 8 mice per group and analysed by Student’s two-tailed t-test.
  **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001. K, L PDZK1-WT overexpression decreased the expression
  and EGFR signalling activation of EGFR-WT. However, PDZK1-WT or PDZK1-MT_S2,3 overexpression
  could not decrease the expression and EGFR signalling activation of EGFR binding
  motif mutant. Data are the representative of three independent experiments (D–H,
  K–L).'
