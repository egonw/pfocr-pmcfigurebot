caption: LncR-133a acts as a molecular sponge for miR-133a-3p. (a) The relative abundance
  of lncR-133a in the cytoplasm and nuclei of MuSCs differentiated for 3 days. 18S
  rRNA and U6 served as cytoplasmic and nuclear controls, respectively. (b) qRT-PCR
  analysis of lncR-133a level in the cytoplasm of undifferentiated MuSCs and MuSCs
  differentiated for 3 days. (c) Schematic diagram of a luciferase reporter containing
  lncR-133a wild type or mutant type of miR-133a-3p targeting site. The seed sequence
  for miR-133a-3p is displayed in red, whereas the mutant sequence for lncR-133a is
  indicated i in blue. (d) Luciferase assays demonstrated that miR-133a-3p inhibits
  the activity of lncR-133a. (e) qRT-PCR analysis of miR-133a-3p expression in MuSCs
  transfected with pEGFP-N1, pEGFP-lncR-133a, si-NC, and si-lncR-133a, respectively.
  (f) qRT-PCR evaluation of the expression levels of lncR-133a and miR-133a-3p in
  MuSCs transfected with increasing concentrations of lncR-133a expression vector.
  (g) RIP assay was carried out using AGO2 antibody, with IgG as the negative control.
  (h) The expression of miR-133a-3p was measured after streptavidin capture in MuSCs
  (3 d) transfected with biotin-NC and biotin-lncR-133a. (i) Co-localization of lncR-133a
  and miR-133a-3p in MuSCs. RNA Dual-labeled Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH)
  assay was performed on MuSCs cultured for 3 d, using fluorescent oligonucleotide
  probes complementary to lncR-133a (red) and miR-133a-3p (green). Cell nuclei were
  visualized with DAPI staining (blue), Scale bars = 100 μm. Data are means ± standard
  error of the mean of at least three biological replicates, * p < 0.05.
