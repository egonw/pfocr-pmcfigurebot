caption: 'ERRα metabolic gene signature profile increases in basal-like breast tumours
  of overweight/obese vs. lean patients. (A) ESRRA gene expression levels in overweight/obese
  breast cancer patients with BMI > 25 (N = 16) vs. lean patients with BMI ≤ 25 (N
  = 15). (B) ERRα metabolic target genes involved in the OXPHOS pathway. (C) ERRα
  metabolic target genes associated with the TCA cycle. (D) ERRα metabolic target
  genes linked to the glycolytic pathway. (E) ERRα metabolic target genes related
  to the glutaminolysis pathway. (F) Gene expression levels involved in PPP intermediates.
  (G) ERRα metabolic target genes associated with the OCM pathway. (H) ERRα metabolic
  target genes involved in detoxifying enzymes. These data were obtained from the
  GEO: GSE78958 study, and were analyzed using R software (version 4.0.2, R core team,
  Vienna, Austria). For all the above panels, the number of patients in the BMI >
  25 group is N = 16, and for the BMI ≤ 25 group is N = 15, and all the analyses were
  performed on basal-like breast tumours obtained from both BMI groups. *, significant
  (p < 0.05). The circle indicates the outliers in the datasets.'
