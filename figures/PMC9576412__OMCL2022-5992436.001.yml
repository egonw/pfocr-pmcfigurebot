caption: 'Naringenin ameliorated renal ischemia reperfusion injury in mice. (a) The
  structural formula of naringenin (NRG). (b, c) The influence about a variety of
  doses of naringenin on the levels of serum Cr as well as serum BUN in normally fed
  eight-week-old C57Bl/6 mice. (d, e) The levels of kidney biomarkers such as serum
  Cr and BUN declined notably in the NRG+I/R group. (f, g) H&E staining (×400) used
  in kidney histological staining showed that kidney tissue damage was mitigated in
  the NRG+I/R group. (h) Western blot analysis utilized in protein detection validated
  that the protein levels of KIM-1 decreased significantly in the NRG+I/R group. Values
  measured during animal experiments were carried out as mean ± SD, n = 3 − 5. &P
  < 0.05, compared with 0 mg/kg group; ∗P < 0.05, compared with the Sham group; #P
  < 0.05, relative to the NS+I/R group; nd: no statistical difference.'
