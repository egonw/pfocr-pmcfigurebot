caption: mRNA expression levels of signaling pathway genes in THP-1 cells treated
  with low glucose or high glucose with/without β-carotene.mRNA levels in THP-1 cells
  treated with low glucose (LG), high glucose (HG), and/or β-carotene (BC) were quantified
  using qRT-PCR. LG, low glucose; HG, high glucose; BC, high glucose with β-carotene.
  Values are expressed as the mean ± SEM (n = 6). The values were normalized against
  TFIIB. Significant differences are indicated by different alphabets (p < 0.05).
article_title: β-Carotene enhances the expression of inflammation-related genes and
  histone H3 K9 acetylation, K4 dimethylation, and K36 trimethylation around these
  genes in juvenile macrophage-like THP-1 cells.
