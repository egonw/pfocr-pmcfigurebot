figure_title: Effects of adiponectin on the mRNA expression of genes related to lipid
  metabolism in chicken myoblasts
caption: (A and B) The relative mRNA abundances of lipid metabolism genes were determined
  by real-time PCR. Data are presented as mean Â± SEM; *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001,
  n=6 in each group.
