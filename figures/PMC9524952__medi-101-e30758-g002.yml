caption: Functional analysis of DEGs correlated with CD8+ T cell in CRC. (A) The differentially
  expressed genes in CRC tissues based on the TCGA database. (B) The differentially
  expressed genes in CRC tissues based on the GSE44076 dataset. (C) Overlapping differentially
  expressed genes and CD8+ T cell-related genes. (D) GO analysis of CD8TDEGs. (E)
  KEGG pathway analysis of CD8TDEGs. CD8TDEGs = differentially expressed genes correlated
  with CD8+ T cell, CRC = colorectal cancer, DEGs = differentially expressed genes.
