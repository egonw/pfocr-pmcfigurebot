caption: Schematic diagram of angiogenesis pathway. HIF-1Î±, which is activated by
  hypoxia, induces VEGF synthesis and leads to angiogenesis. Moreover, PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathway regulates cell proliferation. PI3K was downregulated by Butea Monosperma
  and mixture of green tea, curcumin, quercetin, resveratrol extracts. Both AKT and
  mTOR were inhibited by Biochanin A, Butea Monosperma and mixture of green tea, curcumin,
  quercetin, resveratrol extracts. VEGF was downregulated by bear bile powder, Lachnum
  melanin, dieckol, and zerumbone. The mechanisms of natural products affecting angiogenesis
  were indicated. The upregulations of the molecules were marked with a green arrow
  and the downregulations with a red arrow.
