caption: 'Enrichment analysis. In the bubble chart, the ordinate is the name of the
  biological process or pathway, the abscissa is the proportion of genes, the size
  of the bubble represents the number of genes enriched in each gene ontology, and
  the color represents the significance of the enrichment. A: The Gene Ontology enrichment
  analysis indicates the biological response, gene distribution, and molecular function
  in which the target gene is mainly involved; B: The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
  and Genomes enrichment analysis indicates the main pathway in which the target gene
  has a role. GO: Gene Ontology; KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; AGE-RAGE:
  Advanced glycation end products/receptor of AGE; TNF: Tumor necrosis factor; MAPK:
  Mitogen-activated protein kinase; HIF-1: Hypoxia-inducible factor 1; EGFR: Endothelial
  growth factor receptor; PD-L1: Programmed death-ligand 1; PD-1: Programmed cell
  death protein 1.'
