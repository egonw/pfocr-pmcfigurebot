caption: DET inhibits Wingless-Integrated/β-catenin (Wnt/β-catenin) signaling in cancer
  cells. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of various
  biological processes including cell division, migration, and fate determination
  during embryonic development. Over-expressed β-catenin regulates the transcription
  of oncogenes, including cyclin D1 and c-myc. DET downregulated the expression of
  β-catenin, cyclin D1, and c-myc.
