caption: The semiquantitative evaluation of the ruthenium complexes influence on total
  intracellular NF-κB p65 transcription factor activated in ovarian cancer cells after
  24-, 48- or 72-h treatment; the starred columns indicate a significant increase
  or decrease versus the untreated cells’ NF-κB level. In each interval, the symbol
  U represents the untreated cells, while 1–4 represents the treated cells. The negative
  control (−C) was the fluorescence intensity developed by the cell lysis solution,
  while the positive control (+C) was a reference protein derived from stimulated
  cells (as described in ). Starred columns represent the significant changes versus
  the untreated control.
