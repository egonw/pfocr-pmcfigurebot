caption: DEX activates the ferroptotic pathway of BMSCs. (a) ROS staining was performed
  to test the correlation between different concentrations of DEX and the level of
  oxidative stress. (b) Quantitative analysis of the number of ROS-positive cells
  per field in (a). (c) Annexin V-mCherry/SYTOX Green detection kit was used to detect
  cell death. (d) Quantitative analysis of the percentage of SYTOX green-positive
  cells in (c). (e–i) BMSCs were treated with various concentrations of DEX for 24 h,
  and the expressions of system xc-, ACSL4, GPX4, and FSP1were analyzed by western
  blot and qRT-PCR. (j) Images of immunofluorescence staining of GPX4 in BMSCs after
  treatment with DEX (10−3 M) for 72 h. (k) Quantification of the fluorescence intensity
  of GPX4 immunofluorescence positively stained cells. These studies were performed
  at least 3 biological replicates. Data represent mean ± SD (n = 3). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P
  < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.005 compared with control group.
