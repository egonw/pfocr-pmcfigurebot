caption: VGd@ICG-FA enhances radiotherapy sensitivity by ferroptosis through the GSH-ROS-LPO
  pathway in vitro. (a) Cell viability analysis of 4T1 cells after incubation with
  different formulations for 36 h. (b) Colony formation assays using 4T1 cells incubated
  with different formulations (above). CLSM images of live/dead assay using 4T1 cells
  (down). (c) The quantitative analysis of cloning forming efficacy in b. (d) TEM
  images of mitochondria in 4T1 tumor tissue after different treatments. (e) CLSM
  images of ROS in 4T1 cells after different treatments. (f) The quantitative analysis
  of mean fluorescence intensity in e. (g) CLSM images of Liperfluo in 4T1 cells after
  different treatments. (h) The quantitative analysis of mean fluorescence intensity
  in g. (i) Cytomembrane lipid ROS analysis after different treatments by flow cytometry.
  (j) The quantitative analysis of mean fluorescence intensity in i. (k) Western blot
  assays of the levels of GPX4 protein in 4T1 cells after VGd@ICG-FA inhibition and
  the level were reversed by Ferrostatin 1. (l) The quantitative analysis of mean
  fluorescence intensity in k. The data are shown as the mean Â± SD (*p < 0.05, **p
  < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001).
