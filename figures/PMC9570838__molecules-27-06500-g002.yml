caption: JND4135 suppresses TRK signaling pathway in TRK fusion-driven BaF3 cell lines.
  (A) JND4135 inhibited the TRKA signaling pathways in BaF3-CD74-TRKA, BaF3-CD74-TRKA-G595R
  and BaF3-CD74-TRKA-G667C cells. (B) JND4135 inhibited the TRKB signaling pathways
  in BaF3-ETV6-TRKB, BaF3-ETV6-TRKB-G639R and BaF3-ETV6-TRKB-G709C cells. (C) JND4135
  inhibited the TRKC signaling pathways in BaF3-ETV6-TRKC, BaF3-ETV6-TRKC-G623R and
  BaF3-ETV6-TRKC-G696C cells. Cells were pretreated with 0–200 nmol/L of JND4135 for
  6 h, then harvested and lysed. Cell lysates were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
  gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and analyzed by Western blot for p-TRK, p-PLCγ1 and
  p-Erk. GAPDH was used as a loading control.
