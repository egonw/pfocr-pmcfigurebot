caption: HPL-MSCs inhibit inflammation through the NF-κB signaling pathway. Western
  blot analysis was used to detect (A) expression of TLR4, (B) the expression of p-IκBα,
  IκBα, p-p65, p65, p-IκBα/IκBα and p-p65/p65 (C) the expression of Bax and Bcl-2
  proteins in macrophages. The experiments were representative of at least three independent
  trials, each with three technical replicates. **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001; columns without
  asterisks have no significant difference. The error bars represent standard deviations.
  HPL-MSC, human placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cell; LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  TLR4, toll-like receptor-4; p, phosphorylated.
