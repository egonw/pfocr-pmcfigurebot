caption: Effects of Î±-NETA treatment on renal chemerin/CMKLR1 signaling pathway in
  mice model of DN. Serum levels of chemerin (a) and CMKLR1 (b) were measure by ELISA
  at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. 8 mice were used for each group. RT-qPCR was
  used to measure the mRNA expressions of chemerin (d) and CMKLR1 (e) in renal tissues
  at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. Western blot was used to measure the protein
  expressions of chemerin and CMKLR1 (c) and the relative expressions were normalized
  to control (f, g). The data were obtained from 3 repeated experiments using renal
  homogenate from each group including 8 mice.
