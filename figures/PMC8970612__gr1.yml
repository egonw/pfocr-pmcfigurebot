caption: Project design overview. We searched for studies related to two COVID-19
  genes, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, in PubMed. Next, we used NLP methods to extract biomedical
  concepts and calculated their correlations with COVID-19 genes. Then, we filtered
  out unrelated entities and only kept concept entities belonging to organs, disease,
  genes, etc. Finally, we performed pathway enrichment analysis and predicted drugs
  by network analysis.
