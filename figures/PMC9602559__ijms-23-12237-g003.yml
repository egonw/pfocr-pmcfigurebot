caption: FFA4 engages with a variety of pathways to control signaling and physiological
  functions. Ligand-induced interactions of FFA4 with Gq/G11 G proteins leads to increased
  intracellular [Ca2+] levels. This pathway is fundamental to many of the effects
  that FFA4 has in physiological settings. Numerous efforts to develop synthetic ligands
  of FFA4 have employed receptor-β-arrestin interaction assays. A key physiological
  function of FFA4 engagement with a β-arrestin is the production of anti-inflammatory
  mediators by macrophages. A number of studies have defined the key sites of agonist-mediated,
  GRK-dependent (here shown as GRK6) phosphorylation in both human and mouse FFA4
  (see text). A transgenic knock-in mouse line expressing a phosphorylation-deficient
  (PD mouse) form of FFA4 is available [,] and this will help to assess the specific
  roles and functions of phosphorylation of FFA4, including in mouse models of disease.
  Studies have also shown an important role for FFA4 interactions with pertussis-toxin-sensitive
  G proteins to control the release of the satiety hormone ghrelin [].
