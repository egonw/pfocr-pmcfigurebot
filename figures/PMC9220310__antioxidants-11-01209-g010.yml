caption: The antioxidant capacity of CA was checked in FLS by the JC-1 staining assay.
  (A) A fluorescence microscope was used to examine MMP (ΔΨm) in FLS cells exposed
  to CCCP (positive control), IL-1β (10 ng/mL), CA (50 and 100 μM) for 24 h and stained
  with JC-1 reagent to check the fluorescence, scale bar = 100 μM. (B) Quantitative
  analysis of the red to green fluorescence intensity ratio, with data expressed as
  mean ± S.D., ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001.
