caption: Histological observation of RA on CP-induced ALI in mice and the differences
  between groups were observed using H&E staining at 400× magnification. Pathological
  examination of control group (a) mice; (b) optimal therapeutic dose of RA (20 mg/kg)
  given to mice; (c) CP (20 mg/kg) challenged mice; (d–f) RA (5, 10, 20 mg/kg) treated
  CP-challenged mice; (g) mice were challenged with CP of the DEX (4 mg/kg) control
  treatment drug.
