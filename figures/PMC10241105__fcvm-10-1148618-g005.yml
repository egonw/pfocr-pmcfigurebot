caption: Predicted miRNA-gene regulatory networks in mouse hearts within the first
  9 postnatal days. (A) Chord diagram showing that target genes of early downregulated
  miRNAs (P04–P01) were enriched in GO:BP and KEGG pathways (p ≤ 0.05) associated
  with cell cycle and proliferation. (B) The upregulated miR-150-5p showed negative
  regulatory effect on GO biological processes and KEGG pathways (p ≤ 0.05) related
  to cell cycle and proliferation in P01 to P09 time span. (C,D) Chord diagram demonstrating
  interaction network between enriched biological processes (C) and KEGG pathways
  (D) with downregulated miRNAs identified in P09–P04 and P09–P01 comparisons. The
  enrichment of the target genes of each miRNA with the GO biological processes and
  KEGG pathways (p ≤ 0.05) are presented with a single color. Gene-regulatory networks
  of miRNAs from P09–P01 comparison are shown in black color. The size of the section
  representing each GO term or KEGG pathway is proportional to the number of target
  genes associated with the corresponding GO term or KEGG pathway. (E) Sankey plot
  showing mitochondria-associated GO:CC enriched in verified target genes of downregulated
  miRNAs in the P09–P04 comparison.
