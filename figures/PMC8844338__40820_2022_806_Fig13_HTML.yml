caption: a Schematic of the stretchable CMT-based supercapacitor. b–c Photo image
  of the supercapacitor under the original state and strain of 50% and the current–voltage
  curves at different scan rates. d Schematic of stretchable CMT-based heater. e Time–temperature
  curves of the CMT heater under different voltages from 1 to 3.5 v. f A CMT heater
  affixed on a wrist and the corresponding IR images with the wrist under relax and
  bending state []. Copyright © 2017 American Chemical Society. g–j I–V curves, the
  relative resistance change with the temperature range from 25 to 80 ℃, and the resistance
  change with the temperature sensor under relaxed and bent conditions. j Resistance
  response to cold water and hot water. k–l Schematic illustration and the sensing
  performance of the E-skin under exhaling stimulus and finger pressing stimulus simultaneously
