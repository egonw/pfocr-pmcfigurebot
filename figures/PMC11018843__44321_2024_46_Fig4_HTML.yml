figure_title: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and cytosolic DNA sensors
caption: Mitochondria are the main origin of cytosolic DNA in ALS due to increased
  oxidative stress caused by abnormal TDP-43 and mutant SOD1 leading to mitochondrial
  dysfunction. The release of cytosolic DNA further triggers the cGAS-STING pathway
  to exert an inflammatory response characterized by the production of IFN-I and activation
  of NF-κB activation. These effects can be propagated to neighboring cells through
  the transportation of cGAMP and NF-κB components via CX36 and PANX1, respectively.
