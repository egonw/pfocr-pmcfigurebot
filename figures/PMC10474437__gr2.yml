caption: The involvement of DEL-DEM-DEG and DEC-DEM-DEG networks in signaling pathways,
  transcriptional activity, and cell cycle progression in liver cancer cells. MAPK-mediated,
  PI3K/Akt-mediated, canonical Wnt/β-catenin-mediated, TGF-β-mediated, and integrin-mediated
  signaling as well as cell cycle progression pathways are regulated by DEL-DEM-DEG
  and DEC-DEM-DEG axes during hepatocarcinogenesis. MiRNAs are shown in red, lncRNAs
  in dark green, and circRNAs in blue colors. In human HCC HepG2 cells, miR-26a are
  upregulated to act via PI3K/Akt-mediated signaling [,], while miR-98 inhibits Bcl2
  expression [] and miR-98-5p represses NF-κB in HBV-related HCC MHCC97H-HBV cells
  []. In several human liver cancer lines, lncRNA-based KTN1-AS1/miR-23c/ERBB2IP axis
  activates MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway [], whereas HULC/miR-15a/PTEN [], UBE2R2/miR-302b/EGFR
  and ZEB1-AS1/miR-302b/EGFR axes activate PI3K/PKB(Akt) pathway [,], and LINC00662/miR-15a/β-catenin
  axis activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling [], SBF2-AS1/miR-140-5p/TGFBR1 activates
  TGFβ-signaling []. In HCC tissues and cell lines such as SNU-387 and Huh7, circRNA-based
  circEIF3I/miR-526b-5p/HGF/c-Met and circ_0015756/miR-610/FGFR1 as well as circ_0015756/miR-7/FAK
  axes are identified [,,]. Also, hsa_circ_0016788/hsa_circ_0016788/CDK4/6 axis regulates
  cell cycle [].
