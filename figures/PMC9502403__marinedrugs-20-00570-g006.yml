caption: 'Saq B1 suppresses the migratory and invasive ability of SW480 cells. (A)
  The effects of Saq B1 on the proliferation of and invasion by SW480 cells were investigated
  by colony formation assay. The image on the left shows that the size (top) and number
  (bottom) of colonies formed by cells gradually decreased as the Saq B1 concentration
  increased. Scale bars = 100 µm. The image on the right represents the quantification
  of the colony-forming efficiency. (B) Wound-healing assay to investigate the effects
  of Saq B1 on the migratory abilities of SW480 cells for 48 h. Scale bars = 100 µm.
  (C) Saq B1 inhibited the invasive and migratory ability of SW480 cells in the transwell
  assay. Left: representative images of each condition are displayed. Scale bars =
  100 µm. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.'
