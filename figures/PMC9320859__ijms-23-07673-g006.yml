caption: Effect of AdoMet and miR-34a, miR-34c, and miR-449a mimics on Notch protein
  levels in CRC and TNBC cells. CRC (A) and TNBC (B) cells were transfected with miR-34a,
  miR-34c, and miR-449a mimics, in the presence or not (Control), of 500 μM AdoMet
  for 48 h. Then, cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, incubated with antibodies
  against the indicated proteins and analyzed by Western blot. Housekeeping proteins,
  β-actin and α-tubulin, were used as a loading control. The densitometric analysis
  was reported as a percentage of protein expression of untreated control (100%).
  Data represent the average of three independent experiments. The means were compared
  using analysis of variance (ANOVA) plus Bonferroni’s t-test. Error bars show mean
  ± SD. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 versus control untreated cells. Uncropped images of
  Western blots are reported in .
