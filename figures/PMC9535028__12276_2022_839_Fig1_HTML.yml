figure_title: Characterization of PBMSCs
caption: a Representative images of primary cultures of rat PBMSCs from normal rats
  at Day 14 and traumatized rats at Day 14 and Day 21 and the fourth passage of PBMSCs.
  Scale bars = 200 µm. b Flow cytometry analysis of PBMSC-positive surface markers
  for the MSC markers CD44, CD71, CD90, and CD105 and negative markers for the HSC
  markers CD34 and CD45 and EPC markers CD31 and CD133. c–g PBMSCs were induced to
  differentiate into adipocytes, chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and vascular cells. c
  Adipogenesis-committed differentiation of PBMSCs stained by oil red O (red). d Chondrogenesis-committed
  differentiation of PBMSCs stained with alcian blue (blue). e Osteogenesis-committed
  differentiation of PBMSCs stained by alizarin red (red). f Staining after normal
  culture with a dye-free solution. Scale bars = 100 µm. g Vascular endothelial cells
  were examined via immunofluorescence for the expression of the ectodermal cell markers
  Factor VIII (red) and α-SMA (green). DAPI staining (nuclei; blue) and merged images
  are also shown. Scale bars = 20 µm.
