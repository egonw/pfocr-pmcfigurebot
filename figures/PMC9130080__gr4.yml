caption: Effect of TCS in the formation of active lysosomes in Neuro-2a cells. The
  cells were treated with DMSO (control), 0.2 µM temsirolimus (positive control),
  TCS (10, 30 and 50 µM) for 24 h. Representative confocal microscopic images to show
  the formation of autophagolysosomes in cells by staining with lysotracker DND99
  red stain. Blue arrows indicate the presence of active autophagolysosomes in cells.
  The images were captured at 630× magnification (scale bar, 20 µm). All experiments
  were performed three times independently. TCS, triclosan; Tem, temsirolimus. (For
  interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred
  to the web version of this article.)
