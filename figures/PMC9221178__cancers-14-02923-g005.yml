caption: TLR–IFN signaling in anti-tumor responses. TLRs use a MyD88-independent pathway
  for IFN signaling. Upon TLR stimulation, membrane-localized TLRs (i.e., TLR4) activate
  TRIF through adaptor protein TRAM. TRIF activates TRAF3, which activates the TBK1–IKKε
  complex. The TBK–IKKε complex phosphorylates IRF3. Endosome-localized TLR3 activates
  TRIF directly. Following TRIF activation, TRAF3 is activated and shares downstream
  IFN signaling steps with membrane-localized TLRs. TLR–IFN signaling induces type
  I IFN production, apoptosis, and activation of immune cells. Created with Biorender.com.
