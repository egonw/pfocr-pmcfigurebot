caption: 'FleR downregulates T3SS gene expression by elevating the c-di-GMP level(A)
  Intracellular c-di-GMP contents in the strains of PAO1 WT, ΔfleR and ΔfleR with
  chromosomal complementation of fleR were measured by LC-MS. Tn: empty control of
  the Tn7 vector.(B) β-galactosidase activity of the PexsCEBA-lacZ transcriptional
  fusion was measured in PAO1 WT(EV), ΔfleR(EV), ΔfleR(14945), and ΔfleR(14950) strains.(C)
  Relative expression of exsA and pcrV in PAO1 WT(EV), ΔfleR(EV), ΔfleR(14945), and
  ΔfleR(14950) strains was measured by RT-qPCR.(D) Production of the master T3SS activator
  ExsA in PAO1 WT(EV), ΔfleR(EV), ΔfleR(14945), and ΔfleR(14950) strains was measured
  by western blot assay. Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t test.
