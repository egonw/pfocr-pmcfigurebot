  carbon metabolism into the cytoplasm, nucleus, and mitochondria. Represented reactions
  include methionine cycle, folate cycle, transsulfuration pathway, PEMT flux, and
  DNA methylations, connected to glycolysis via 3PG. ADO, adenosine, AHCY, S-adenosylhomocysteinase;
  ATP, adenosine triphosphate; BHMT, betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase; CBS,
  cystathionine β-synthase; CTH, γ-cystathionine lyase; DNMTs, DNA methyltransferases;
  FAD, Flavin adenine dinucleotide; FADH2, reduced Flavin adenine dinucleotide; GNMT,
  glycine-N-methyltetrahydrofolate; 5,10-CH2THF, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate; MTs,
  methyltransferases; MTR, MTHF-homocysteine methyltransferase; MTHFR, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase; P, phosphate; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine;
  PEMT, phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase; 3PG, 3-phosphogycerate; PPi,
  pyrophgosphate; SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine; SAMe, S-adenosylmethionine; SDH, sarcosine
  dehydrogenase; SHMT, serine hydroxymethyltransferase; THF, tetrahydrofolate.
