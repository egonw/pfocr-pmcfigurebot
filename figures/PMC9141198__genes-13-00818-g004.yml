caption: MiR-133a-3p promotes MuSC differentiation. (a) The expression level of miR-133a-3p
  was measured in MuSCs transfected with miR-133a-3p mimics (mimics) or mimics negative
  control (mimics-NC). (b) The expression levels of MyoG and MyoD were determined
  in MuSCs transfected with miR-133a-3p mimics or mimics-NC. (c) The expression level
  of miR-133a-3p was measured in MuSCs transfected with miR-133a-3p inhibitor (inhibitor)
  or inhibitor negative control (inhibitor-NC). (d) The expression levels of MyoG
  and MyoD were determined in MuSCs transfected with miR-133a-3p inhibitor or inhibitor-NC.
  (e) The protein levels of MyoG and MyoD were measured in MuSCs transfected with
  miR-133a-3p mimics or mimics-NC, miR-133a-3p inhibitor or inhibitor-NC. (f) The
  expression levels MyoG and MyoD were determined after treatment with miR-133a-3p
  mimics and/or pEGFP-lncR-133a. (g) The protein levels of MyoG and MyoD in MuSCs
  transfected with miR-133a-3p mimics and/or pEGFP-lncR-133a. Data are means Â± standard
  error of the mean of at least three biological replicates, * p < 0.05.
