caption: Enrichment analyses of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related
  to triterpenoid saponin (TS) biosynthesis. (A) shows Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment
  analyses of DEGs among the above four comparison groups. It is composed of four
  cycles. Cycle 1 (Cy1, the outermost cycle) means nine GO terms located in the above
  four comparison groups. Cycle 2 (Cy2, the secondary outer cycle) means the number
  of DEGs corresponding to GO terms. The different colors of the rectangles below
  the number are the q_value (-log10). Cycle 3 (Cy3, the sub-internal cycle) means
  the number of upregulated and downregulated genes corresponding to GO Classify2,
  which were labeled in pink and green, respectively. Cycle 4 (Cy4, the innermost
  cycle) means the enrichment range and the enrichment factors of GO terms, including
  cellular components, biological processes, and molecular functions. The green circular
  line indicates enrichment factor = 1. (B) shows the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
  and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses of DEGs in N1_vs_B1, N2_vs_B2, N1_vs_N2,
  and B1_vs_B2 comparison groups. The abscissa and ordinate denote the enrichment
  factors and pathways, respectively. The size and color of the circles represent
  the number and q_value of DEGs.
