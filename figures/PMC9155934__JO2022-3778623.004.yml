caption: MAP9 promotes cell proliferation and inhibits cell apoptosis in vitro. (a)
  Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was conducted to analyze the proliferation of
  T24 and 5637 cells after silencing MAP9. (b) Cell colonies stained with crystal
  violet were captured and counted after silencing MAP9 in T24 and 5637 cells. (c)
  Effects of MAP9 silencing on the cell cycle distribution of T24 and 5637 cells.
  (d) Effects of MAP9 silencing on the cell apoptosis of T24 and 5637 cells. Data
  are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD), and paired Student's t-test
  was employed for data analysis. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
