caption: Targeted analysis of PI3K/mTOR and MAPK pathway activity markers confirms
  regulation of eEF2K by PI3Ki plus MEKi cotreatment. A–H, cancer cell lines were
  treated with kinase inhibitors for 1 h at 500 nM individually or in combination.
  Examples of phosphopeptide ion intensities (summed peak area) of phosphopeptides
  containing the named phosphorylation site across the named cell lines. Boxplots
  show median and interquartile ranges. p-values were calculated by t test (n = 3
  independent experiments performed in technical replicates). Intensity values for
  each peptide were derived from the chromatographic peak areas of the extracted ion
  chromatograms and normalized to the total intensity in each sample. ppm denotes
  normalized intensity values multiplied by one million. I, heatmap of eEF2 and eEF2K
  phosphopeptides significantly modulated in at least one the conditions being compared
  to control. p-values were calculated by t test of log2 transformed data. ∗p < 0.05,
  ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ∗∗∗p < 0.0001. J and K, eEF2 phosphopeptide signals (J)
  and ratio of phosphorylation relative to eEF2 total protein expression levels (K)
  across all the named cell lines in basal conditions. p-values were calculated by
  Kruskal–Wallis test. eEF2, eukaryotic elongation factor 2; eEF2K, eukaryotic elongation
  factor 2 kinase.
