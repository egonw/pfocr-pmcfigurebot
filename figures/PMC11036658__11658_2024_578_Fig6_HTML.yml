caption: Inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway by (+)-ABX in NSCLC cells.
  A Impact of different concentrations of (+)-ABX treatment on the expression of PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  signaling pathway-related proteins in cells determined by western blotting. B Quantification
  of the data presented in (A). C Changes in the expression of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
  pathway-related proteins upon intervention with LY294002 after treatment with (+)-ABX
  assessed by western blotting. D Quantification of the data presented in (C). E Alterations
  in the expression of apoptosis and autophagy-related proteins upon LY294002 intervention
  after treatment with (+)-ABX measured by western blotting. F Quantification of the
  data presented in (E). G Evaluation of the impact of LY294002 pretreatment on cell
  viability upon (+)-ABX treatment using the CCK-8 assay. Values are expressed as
  means ± SD. * or △P < 0.05, ** or △△P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001, compared with the
  control. Data were collected from a minimum of three independent experiments
