figure_title: TSC-derived glutamine protects cancer cells from microenvironmental
  stress
caption: 'a Depiction of the collagen degradation pathway in TSCs that results in
  the production of glutamine (Gln), a transportable metabolite that can be exploited
  by cancer cells. b Viability of TEM8 wildtype (WT) or knockout (KO) TSCs under nutrient
  starvation in the presence or absence of col1. n = 5 biologically independent samples
  per group. Statistical analysis was calculated using an unpaired T test. c Viability
  of SW620 cancer cells under nutrient starvation in the presence or absence of col1.
  n = 5 biologically independent samples per group. *; p < 0.0001. Statistical analysis
  was calculated by using one-way analysis of variance with a Tukey’s test. d Relative
  ATP production in SW620 cells in the presence or absence of glutamine (Gln). n = 8
  biologically independent samples per group. *; p < 0.0001. Statistical analysis
  was calculated by using an unpaired T test. e Viability of SW620 cancer cells under
  nutrient starvation in co-cultures with TEM8 wildtype or knockout TSCs. n = 5 biologically
  independent samples per group. *; p < 0.0001. Statistical analysis was calculated
  by using one-way analysis of variance with a Tukey’s test. Western blotting was
  used to detect PEPD (f), GLUL (g) or PRODH (h) expression in wildtype TSCs following
  knockdown (KD) with non-specific control shRNA or gene-specific shRNA. Images were
  representative of three experiments. Viability of SW620 cancer cells under nutrient
  starvation upon co-culture with PEPD (i), GLUL (j), or PRODH (k) knock down (KD)
  TSCs. NS-shRNA: non-specific control shRNA. n = 5 biologically independent samples
  per group. *; p < 0.0001, **; p < 0.0003. Statistical analysis was calculated by
  using one-way analysis of variance with a Tukey’s test. l Relative abundance of
  each of the 20 amino acids in the supernatants of TSC-WT, TSC-KO, or TSC-WT cells
  following m830 anti-TEM8 antibody treatment. To minimize experimental variability,
  data from two experiments were combined (n = 3 per group). *; p < 0.0001. Statistical
  analysis was calculated by using one-way analysis of variance with a Tukey’s test.
  m Viability of nutrient-starved SW620 cancer cells in TSC co-cultures following
  treatment with L-Asparaginase (L-Asp). n = 5 biologically independent samples per
  group. *; p < 0.0001. Statistical analysis was calculated by using an unpaired T
  test. Gln; glutamine, Pro; proline, H; high serum, 10% FBS, L; low serum 0.5% FBS.
  Data are denoted as mean ± s.d. Source data are provided as a  file.'
