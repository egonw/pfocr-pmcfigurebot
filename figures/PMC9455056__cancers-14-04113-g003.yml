caption: Serine-glycine synthesis pathway. Intermediates and products (highlighted
  in cyan) of this metabolic pathway serve as building blocks for the synthesis of
  proteins, lipids, nucleotides, reducing equivalents (NADH and NADPH), glutathione,
  and S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM). MTHFD, Methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase;
  PHGDH, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase; PSAT1, phosphoserine Aminotransferase 1;
  PSPH, phosphoserine phosphatase; SHMT, serine hydroxymethyltransferase. MYCN targets
  are highlighted in red.
