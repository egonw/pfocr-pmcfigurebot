caption: Effects of HO‐3867 on the phosphorylation of MAPK pathway in SCC‐9 and HSC‐3
  cells. (A) Expressions of ERK1/2, JNK1/2 and p38, as well as their phosphorylation
  after various concentrations (0, 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 µM) of HO‐3867 treatment for
  24 h in SCC‐9 and HSC‐3 cells, were measured via Western blot analysis. (B) They
  were subjected to quantitative analysis. *p < 0.05, compared with the vehicle group
