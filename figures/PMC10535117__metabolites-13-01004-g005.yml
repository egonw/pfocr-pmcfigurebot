caption: 'Expression patterns of genes in the anthocyanin synthesis pathway in leaves
  treated with blue light (BL) and/or sucrose. Gene expression values are shown in
  log10 (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM)). All
  heat maps show expression levels for the indicated genes in the following order
  from left to right: leaves treated with white light and no sucrose; leaves treated
  with BL and no sucrose; leaves treated with white light and 500 mM sucrose; and
  leaves treated with BL and 500 mM sucrose.'
