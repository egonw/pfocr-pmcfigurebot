figure_title: GXYLT1S212* promotes migration and invasion partially via the Notch
  pathway, unlike Notch pathway dependence of WT GXYLT1
caption: a, b Western blot analysis of the protein levels of the Notch protein intracellular
  domain (NICD) and Hes1 in CRC cells transfected as indicated. Bar graphs show quantitative
  analysis of protein levels. c, d Transwell migration and invasion assays of transfected
  CRC cells treated with the Notch pathway inhibitor DAPT or the DMSO control for
  48 h. Charts show quantification of migrated cells. e, f Western blot analysis of
  NICD and Hes1 in cell lysates. Bar graphs show quantification of NICD and Hes1 protein
  levels. Data are presented as the mean ± SD of at least three independent experiments.
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
