caption: TGFβ signaling pathway via SMAD-TGFβ ligand binds to transmembrane TGFβ type-II
  receptor (TGFβRII) and induces its phosphorylation, followed by autophosphorylation
  of TGFβ type-I (TGFβRI) receptor forming a heterotetrameric receptor complex with
  two type I receptors and two type II receptors. Activated TGFβRI initiates TGFβ/Smad
  signaling by phosphorylating receptor-associated Smads (R-Smads), Smad2, and Smad3.
  The activated R-Smads form a complex with Co-Smad and shuttles into the nucleus,
  binding to DNA at Smad-binding element in the promoter region of the TGFβ targeted
  gene. TGFβ receptor complex can also activate non-smad dependent pathways like Ras/ERK
  pathway, PI3K/AKT pathway, etc.
