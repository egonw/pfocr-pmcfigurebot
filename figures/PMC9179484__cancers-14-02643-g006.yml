caption: Two acetyl-CoA metabolism pathways are markers of HDAC inhibitor sensitivity.
  (a,b) Key acetyl-CoA metabolic pathways involved in response to eight HDAC inhibitors
  were selected by elastic net analysis in CCLE panel (see ). Leading-edge genes for
  the acetyl-CoA pathways were overlaid onto pathway representations, with upregulated
  genes in red and downregulated genes in blue. (c) Three gene signatures were derived
  from the two pathways and signature scores were calculated in CCLE panel by weighted
  averaged expression using both up- and down-regulated genes. KRAS activation signatures
  were also calculated by the same method using the C6 collection in the Molecular
  Signatures Database. Significant differences for all signature scores between resistant
  versus sensitive cell lines were calculated by Welch’s t-test in CCLE panel for
  eight HDACis, and results were plotted in a heatmap. Numbers in parentheses indicate
  the number of cell lines tested for each HDACi. (d) Acetyl-CoA Signature scores
  were plotted (boxplot with individual data point) according to response to Belinostat
  in AML patients (independent cohort). Statistical significance between groups was
  assessed using unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test (NS stands for “not significant”).
