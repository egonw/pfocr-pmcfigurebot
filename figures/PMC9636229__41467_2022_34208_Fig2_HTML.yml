figure_title: Spatially resolved shotgun proteomics analysis
caption: A Matrix correlation map between all microextraction points from the 46 tumors.
  Correlation coefficients are calculated between each sample and are represented
  on a heatmap. B Heatmap of proteins with different regulation profiles as determined
  after label-free quantification in the three groups highlighting the presence of
  three clusters. Shotgun proteomics was performed after on-tissue trypsin digestion
  followed by microextraction at the spots determined from MALDI-MSI data. C Pathway
  analysis of proteins overexpressed in group A reveals that a large majority of protein
  is involved in (a) neurogenesis, brain development, synaptogenesis and cytoskeleton
  organization. D Pathway analysis of proteins overexpressed in group B reveals that
  majority of proteins are involved in injuries, inflammation, and more generally
  immune system response and vascularization. E Pathway analysis of proteins overexpressed
  in group C shows implication in cell proliferation, neoplastic processes, RNA metabolism
  and processing and viral reproduction. F Heatmap of alternative proteins with different
  regulation profiles as determined after label-free quantification in the three regions
  highlighting the presence of three clusters. Source data are provided as a Supplementary
  Data file.
