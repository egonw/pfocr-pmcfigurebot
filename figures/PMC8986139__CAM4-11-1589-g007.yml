caption: RNASEH1‐AS1 regulates NSCLC cell progression. (A) NSCLC cell lines were subjected
  to qRT‐PCR to assess RNASEH1‐AS1 expression. (B) The RNASEH1‐AS1 levels in si‐RNASEH1‐AS1‐transfected
  or pc‐RNASEH1‐AS1‐transfected cells were examined. (C, D) The proliferation of NSCLC
  cells with si‐RNASEH1‐AS1 or pc‐RNASEH1‐AS1 transfection. (E) Cell apoptosis was
  assessed in NSCLC cells in which RNASEH1‐AS1 was knocked down or overexpressed.

article_title: Long noncoding RNASEH1‐AS1 exacerbates the progression of non‐small
  cell lung cancer by acting as a ceRNA to regulate microRNA‐516a‐5p/FOXK1 and thereby
  activating the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway.
