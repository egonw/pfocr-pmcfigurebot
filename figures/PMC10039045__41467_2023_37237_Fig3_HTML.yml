figure_title: cRGT brings the signaling protein Rac1 to the proximity of inner PM
  to initialize the signaling cascade of lamellipodia formation
caption: 'a A non-PM targeting and constitutively active EGFP-NES-Rac1Q61LΔCAAX (i.e.
  G-NES-Rac1) mutant with the truncation of its PM-targeting C-terminal CAAX-box was
  engineered and co-expressed with mCherry-eDHFR-CAAX in live HeLa cells; treatment
  of HeLa cells with cRGT will target Rac1 mutant to the functional PM location and
  initialize lamellipodia signaling pathway. WAVE WASp-family verprolin-homologous
  protein, Arp2/3 actin-related proteins-2/3. b Representative live HeLa cells coexpression
  of G-NES-Rac1 (green, cytosolic) and mCherry-ED-CAAX (red, PM) before adding cRGT
  (Pre), after treatment with cRGT (24 μM, 1.5 h), and after adding TMP (10 μM, 10 min);
  NES: nucleus exporting signal, LQNKLEELDL, which reduces Rac1’s accumulation in
  the nucleus. c Statistical PCC analysis between EGFP and mCherry channels (n = 22
  cells for Pre, n = 21 cells for cRGT, n = 18 cells for TMP); one-sided Student’s
  t-test was used; see Methods for description of box plots. d Quantification of the
  cell areas before adding cRGT (Pre), after adding 24 μM cRGT, and after adding 10 μM
  TMP for 10 min (n = 22 cells for Pre, n = 21 cells for cRGT, n = 17 cells for TMP);
  one-sided Student’s t-test was used; see Methods for description of box plots. e
  Representative confocal images of a comparable CID (TMP-Cl, 10 μM, 1 h) induced
  targeting of eDHFR-EGFP-NES-Rac1Q61LΔCAAX (i.e. ED-G-NES-Rac1) to PM without washing
  (left) and after washing out (30 min) excess of TMP-Cl (right); HT HaloTag. f Comparison
  between cRGT and TMP-Cl induced dimerization using line profile analysis. All scale
  bars: 10 μm.'
