caption: Nrf2 KO affects ferroptosis signaling pathway-induced cisplatin resistance.
  (a) Western blots of Nrf2, TfR1, and GPX4 protein expressions in control and Nrf2
  KO cells with or without 25 μM cisplatin treatment for 24h. (b) RT -PCR verification
  of TfR1 mRNA expression levels in control and Nrf2 KO cells with or without 25 μM
  cisplatin treatment for 24h. (c) RT -PCR verification of GPX4 mRNA expression levels
  in control and Nrf2 KO cells with or without 25 μM cisplatin treatment for 24h.
  (d) FerroOrange indicated the intracellular Fe2+ content after treatment with 25 μM
  cisplatin for 24h. (e) Relative fluorescence intensity of FerroOrange for the cells
  in (d). (f) Western blots of Nrf2, CTR1, TfR1, p53, and GPX4 protein expressions
  in control and Nrf2 KO cells treated with 25 μM cisplatin for different lengths
  of time. ∗p < 0:05, ∗∗p < 0:01, and ∗∗∗p < 0:001. Scale bar, 20 μm.
