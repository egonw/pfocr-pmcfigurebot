caption: (a) Relative switching yield probed in a 2D scheme. Preparation period   and
  response period t are scanned in a Cartesian grid. (b) High-resolution cuts along
  t, while   is matched to either rotation (top) or shear (bottom) mode. Insets show
  Fourier transforms of the traces. Shear (0.54 THz) and rotation (0.85 THz) mode
  amplitudes are modulated via phase-matching. Low-frequency tails indicate electronic
  softening within the excited PES. (c)  -dependent modulation of shear (0.5–0.6 THz)
  and rotation (0.8–0.9 THz) mode amplitudes after Fourier transformation along t.
  (d) 2D Fourier transform along   and t. Prominent peaks appear at the rotation (pink,
  dashed) and shear (gold, dashed) mode frequencies.
