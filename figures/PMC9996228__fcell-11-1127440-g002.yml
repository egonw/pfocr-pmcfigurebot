caption: Recombination checkpoint pathway. Model showing the proposed signaling pathway
  in response to unrepaired SPO11-dependent DSBs in male (left) and female (right)
  mice. Asterisks represent predicted checkpoint factors. In males, DSBs are sensed
  by the MRN complex, leading to the activation of ATM, which in turn activates effector
  CHK2. CHK2 acts on target proteins p53 and TAp63, which implement the recombination-dependent
  arrest that blocks progression to mid/late pachynema. In females, RNF212 prevents
  the repair of residual DSBs in the late prophase. Unrepaired DSBs likely activate
  ATR, which may activate CHK2 before birth and CHK1 after birth. CHK1 and CHK2 signal
  to p53 and TAp3. Pro-apoptotic BCL-2 pathway components PUMA, NOXA, BAX, and other
  unknown factors act downstream to trigger oocyte apoptosis.
