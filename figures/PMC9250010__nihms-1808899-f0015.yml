figure_title: Proteomic breakdown of engineered cardiac tissues studied over four
  weeks in (i) InterOrgan multi-tissue platform, (ii) in the Mixed media approach,
  and (iii) in Isolation
caption: a, excitation threshold and b, maximum capture rate of cardiac tissues for
  each experimental condition (i-iii) (InterOrgan and Mixed n=6 biological replicates,
  Isolated n=3 biological replicates). c, PCA clustering of each experimental condition
  (i-iii). d, Comparison of integrated versus mixed conditions via differential protein
  abundances. e, Proteins important to cardiac tissue function, structure, energetics,
  and calcium handling. f, PGSEA pathway analysis showing the top 30 GO Biological
  Process pathways related to disease and function in integrated vs. mixed conditions,
  with red indicating activated and blue indicating suppressed pathways.
