caption: 'A Volcano plot of proteomics data for WM3734 MCUA_KD versus shCTRL. Protein
  hits with significant P‐values (P < 0.05) are marked in red. Protein hits with both
  significant P‐value and FDR (false discovery rate) (P < 0.05; FDR < 0.05) are marked
  in green.B, C Proteomap analyses in WM3734 MCUA_KD cells, based on data shown in
  (A) (red dots).D KEGG‐based analysis of cellular components and processes based
  on protein hits that show differential expression between in WM3734 MCUA_KD and
  shCTRL cells, revealed via proteomics.E, F Enrichment analyses of GO terms and pathways
  in WM3734 MCUA_KD cells, based on proteomic analysis. GO analyses were performed
  according to two GO categories: biological processes (E) and molecular function
  (F).G Cancer hallmark‐based enrichment analysis based on proteomics data shown in
  (A). Percentage of hits in the specific gene set is displayed.H Heatmap encompassing
  RPPA values of proteins detected in WM3734 and 1205Lu MCUA_KD (shMCU_1 and shMCU_2)
  cells.I, J Proteomap‐based pathway analyses in WM3734 and 1205Lu MCUA_KD cells,
  based on RPPA data shown in (H).K KEGG‐based analysis of cellular components and
  processes involved in WM3734 and 1205Lu MCUA_KD cell regulation.L, M Enrichment
  analyses of GO (gene ontology) terms and pathways in WM3734 and 1205Lu MCUA_KD cells,
  based on RPPA data. GO analyses were performed according to two GO categories: biological
  processes (L) and molecular function (M).N Hallmark of cancer‐based enrichment analysis
  in WM3734 and 1205Lu MCUA_KD cells, based on RPPA data. Percentage of hits in the
