caption: CXCL8 promotes EndMT in endothelial cells via CXCR2 (a–g). qRT-PCR (a–f)
  and western blotting (g) were performed to assess the expression of CXCR2, CD31,
  CDH5, CD34, S100A4, ACTA2, and CDH2 in n PUMC-HUVEC-T1 cells treated with TGF-β1
  (5 ng/mL) for 24 h alone or in combination with CXCL8 (50 ng/mL). For the indicated
  groups, SB225002 (30 nM, a CXCR2 antagonist) or TPCA-1 (1 μM, a potent selective
  inhibitor of IKK-2) were applied 2 h before CXCL8 treatment. (h,i). A tube formation
  assay was performed to assess the use of Matrigel (h), with treatments indicated
  in panel a. The number of tubule branches per view field was calculated using the
  angiogenesis analyzer of Image J software (v.1.52) (i). The data are expressed as
  the mean ± SD of three experiments. **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001.
