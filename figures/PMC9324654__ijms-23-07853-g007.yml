caption: Stable CYP27C1-knockdown alters Akt-p53 signal transduction in human lung
  cancer cells. (A–C) A549-shCYP27C1, H1975-shCYP27C1, and the corresponding control
  cells were seeded in 6-well plate for 24 h before protein extraction and quantitation.
  Total Akt, phosphorylated Akt, p53, and β-actin were detected by immunoblot analysis
  using the corresponding antibodies. Grey scales of the bands were measured by Gel-Pro
  ANALYZER, and analyzed by unpaired two-tailed T test. *, p < 0.05, n.s., p > 0.05.

  Sensitivity towards Multiple Anticancer Agents and Its Potential Interplay with
  the IGF-1R/Akt/p53 Signaling Pathway.
