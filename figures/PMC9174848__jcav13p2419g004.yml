caption: (A, B) The expression levels of AKT and p-AKT following FUZ knockdown and
  overexpression. si-FUZ is FUZ siRNA, si-NC is siRNA negative control, pcDNA-FUZ
  is overexpressed FUZ, and NC is negative control. (C) The results of transwell assay
  without Matrigel showing that FUZ enhances the migration ability were abolished
  by LY294002. (D) The results of transwell assay with Matrigel showing that FUZ enhances
  the invasion ability were abolished by LY294002. pcDNA-FUZ is overexpressed FUZ,
  LY294002 is PI3K inhibitor, pcDNA-FUZ+LY294002 is overexpressed FUZ+PI3K inhibitor,
  and NC is negative control. (E, F) The protein levels of GLUT1, AKT, and p-AKT,
  and were evaluated by the exposure of LY294002. Measurements were taken from three
  independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001.
