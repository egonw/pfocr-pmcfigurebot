figure_title: FD268 inhibits the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling in HL-60 and MOLM-16 cells
caption: 'HL-60 and MOLM-16 cells were treated with FD268 at increasing concentrations
  for 24h and harvested to measure the levels of PI3K pathway proteins by western
  blot. (A) AKT, p-AKT (Ser473), p-AKT (Thr308), mTOR, and p-mTOR (Ser2448) was detected.
  (B) The level of phosphorylated mTOR target proteins: p-4E-BP1 and p70 ribosomal
  protein S6 kinase (p-p70S6K) was detected by western blot. FD268 concentration-dependently
  inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR and downstream targets of PI3K pathway.
  Intensity of the bands was measured, and the fold change of the intensity was compared
  with that of the control and indicated below the bands. Î²-actin was used as a loading
  control.'
