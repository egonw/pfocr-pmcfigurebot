caption: 'The signal molecules modulated by IGFBP7 and MMRN2. The red icons represent
  the signal molecule regulated by MMRN2, and the purple icons represent the signaling
  molecules regulated by IGFBP7. 1). IGFBP7 promoted TGF-1R and AKT phosphorylation
  and activated the p38MAPK pathway, upregulating p53, p27Kip1, and p21Cip1. 2). IGFBP7
  inhibited AKT and MPK3 activity, MEK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and COX-2 and VEGF
  mRNA expression. IGFBP7 interrupts the IGF1R-IGF1/2 interaction and, in turn, inhibited
  the downstream PI3K-AKT pathway. 3) TGF-β1 induced by TGF-β1/ALK5/Smad-2 and VEGF
  induced IGFBP7 expression. MKP3 could inhibit IGFBP7 expression. IGFBP7 transcriptional
  activation required Smarcb1 participation, while Smarcb1 inhibited AKT activation.
  4) MMRN2 inhibited p38 activation and Src, VEGFR2, and VE-cadherin phosphorylation.
  5) MMRN2 downregulated VEGFR1, VEGFR2, Tie2, MLC2, Apelin, and Ang-2. 6) MMRN2 upregulated
  VE-cadherin, β-catenin, ZO-1, and JAM-A, MMRN2 upregulated some cytokines, such
  as Ang2, PDGF, and HB-EGF, and 7) VEGFF-A could downregulate MMRN2. Alt Text: There
  is a connected cell in the figure in which the intrinsic pathways involved in the
  relevant molecules are marked'
