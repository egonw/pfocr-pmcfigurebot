caption: Pathways specific to any stroke or any ischemic stroke. Gene-set analyses
  illustrate the top pathways enriched for ischemic stroke when the PRS was constructed
  based on each of the five summary statistics of MEGASTROKE (color of the bars) stratified
  by controls with index age ≥ 69yrs or 79 yrs, as shown in the y-axis. Here, we selected
  the VEGF signaling pathway, regulation of amyloid precursor protein catabolic process,
  and negative regulation of interleukin 2 production as examples to show the specificity
  of these pathways significantly enriched only for the PRS constructed by the polygenic
  architecture of MEGASTROKE AS or AIS. PRS was constructed under two levels of MAF
  thresholding. Here, we only chose MAF ≤ 0.025 as an example to show that these pathways
  were the top pathways under this condition. All the raw p values in the x-axis demonstrate
  the significance of the enriched signals against the background without correction
  for multiple testing. The gene network that harbors those genetic risks with a moderate
  effects size for ischemic stroke (p < 0.1) were illustrated using String-db. Here,
  we chose genes included in the VEGF signaling pathway as an example.
