figure_title: IL-6 specifically induces LCN2 promoter activity under control of the
  NF-κB and STAT3 signaling pathways
caption: (A) Human CRC cells were transfected with reporter plasmid carrying a 1233-bp
  fragment of the LCN2 promoter, then the growth medium supplemented with IL-6 was
  added to the cells. After 24 h, the cells were harvested and promoter activities
  were determined. The data represent the mean ± SE of three independent experiments.
  **P<0.01 versus unstimulated cells. (B) After transfection with LCN2 promoter construct,
  IL-6 and specific inhibitors were added to DLD-1 cells for 24 h. Then, the promoter
  activities of LCN2 were determined (left). DLD-1 cells were co-transfected with
  LCN2 promoter construct and indicated siRNA, then the cells were stimulated with
  IL-6 for 24 h. Alterations in LCN2 promoter activities were detected. The data represent
  the mean ± SE of three independent experiments **P<0.01 versus unstimulated cells
  or stimulated cells.
