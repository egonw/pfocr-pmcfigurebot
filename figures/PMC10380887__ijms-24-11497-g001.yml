caption: 'mTOR signaling network and cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase pathway.
  Insulin acts through the PI3K pathway and leads to signaling cascades that further
  activate mTORC1 and mTORC2. Upstream regulators converge at the TSC complex to either
  activate or inhibit mTORC1 activity. The RAG GTPases are the key component of the
  amino acid sensing machinery. The second messenger signaling including cAMP and
  cGMP pathways regulates mTOR activity through both direct and indirect mechanisms.
