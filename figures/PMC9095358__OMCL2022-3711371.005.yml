caption: Effects of different FA types on chondrocyte viability and proliferation.
  Cell viability of PA (a), OLA (b), LA (c), and DHA (d) on SW1353 cells. (e) Cell
  viability of LPS on SW1353 cells. (f) The relative protein expression of Collagen
  II in SW1353 cells treated with LPS (1000 ng/mL) was detected by Western blot analysis.
  The data are presented as the means ± SD, n = 3. ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01 versus
  the CON group.
