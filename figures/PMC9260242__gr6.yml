caption: RqPCR confirmed repression of OSR2 across the carcinogenic pathway (a) and
  the hypermethylation of its associated CpG site was confirmed using pyrosequencing
  (c). A sample pyrogram from an OSR2 methylation assay in normal FT sample (b). Sequence
  analysed is along the bottom of figure. The blue bars represent the target CpG dinucelotides
  and the figures above these represent the percentage methylation at that position.
  A figure highlighted in red indicates a result that needs review and may constitute
  a failed reading. In the initial validation within the “study cohort” all values
  were included, and a mean methylation calculated for each sample. However, within
  the larger validation sample set combinations of the methylation position scores
  were assessed to confirm which was most discriminatory. (For interpretation of the
  references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version
  of this article.)
