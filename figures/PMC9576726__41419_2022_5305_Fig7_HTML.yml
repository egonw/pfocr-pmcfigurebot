figure_title: Schematic diagram of the effects of MSC-Exos on glycolysis and renal
  fibrosis
caption: In the process of renal fibrosis, TECs undergo a metabolic shift to aerobic
  glycolysis, and MSC-Exos are able to attenuate renal fibrosis by inhibiting glycolysis
  in TECs via the miR-21a-5p/PFKM pathway. The schematic diagram was created by biorender.com.
