caption: 'Roles of CLU and the NF-κB pathway for HSC/MPPs of patients with untreated
  PV. (A) PV stem/progenitor cell protein signature. (B) Volcano plot of protein intensity
  fold changes and P values comparing HSC/MPP-specific findings of patients with untreated
  PV (PV.UT.HSC/MPP vs PV.UT.CMP/MEP) against HSC/MPP-specific findings of controls
  (Control.HSC/MPP vs Control.CMP/MEP), and (C) HSC/MPP-specific findings of PV patients
  with HU therapy (PV.HU.HSC/MPP vs PV.HU.CMP/MEP) against HSC/MPP-specific findings
  of patients with untreated PV (PV.UT.HSC/MPP vs PV.UT.CMP/MEP). (D) GSEA plot for
  NF-κB signaling in HSC/MPPs of patients with untreated PV compared with controls
  (PV.UT.HSC/MPP vs Control.HSC/MPP). The normalized enrichment score and significance
  values are provided. (E) Methylcellulose colony assay: Colony growth from FACS-isolated
  HSC/MPPs of patients with untreated chronic PV (PVchron.UT) was evaluated in the
  presence or absence of CLU, IKK-16, or their combination. Percentages of colonies
  relative to the total cell numbers plated are plotted. Error bars represent standard
  deviations. One-way (total colonies) and 2-way (granulocyte/macrophage and erythroid
  colonies) analysis of variance testing was applied using Tukey (1-way) and Dunnett
  (2-way) correction for multiple testing. *Adjusted P < .05; **adjusted P < .01;
  ***adjusted P < .001; ****adjusted P < .0001.'
