caption: 'PUG inhibits the NF-κB pathway in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells: Western
  blot analysis of the NF-κB pathway proteins. After the treatment with LPS and PUG,
  the protein was isolated from the cells and Western blotting was performed. The
  expression levels were calculated by the densitometry with the SEM of three independent
  values. The relative density was calculated with the total form and phospho forms
  of the protein. The statistical significance was ### p < 0.001 vs. untreated group;
  and ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 vs. LPS-alone treated group.'
