figure_title: SREBP2 is upregulated in squamous cell carcinoma
caption: 'a Violin plots showing expression of USP28, SREBF2, HMGCS1 and FDFT1 in
  human Lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) and lung squamous carcinoma (SCC). Data are from
  TCGA (Firehose legacy). Significance was calculated using Mann–Whitney test. ****p < 0.0001.
  b Tissue sections from a human NSCLC TMA were stained for USP28, SREBP2 HMGCS1 and
  SREBP1 by immunohistochemistry. Haematoxilin and eosin (H&E) staining is also shown.
  Representative images for SCC are shown. c Boxplots showing quantification of USP28,
  SREBP2, HMGCS and SREBP1 staining in SCC and ADC tumours. Percent positive cells
  are shown. (SCC: n = 33; ADC: n = 75; ***p < 0.001, Mann-Whitney test). d Pearson
  correlation between expression of USP28, SREBP2 and HMGCS in SCC tumours (R = Pearson
  correlation coefficient, p = two tailed t-test). e Kaplan–Meier plots of overall
  survival of lung cancer patients (N = 1925) dichotomised into ‘high’ and ‘low’ based
  on median USP28 or SREBF2 expression score. Survival differences were calculated
  with the log-rank test.'
