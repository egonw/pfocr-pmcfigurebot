caption: Loureirin A inhibits and TGF-β1 promotes KF proliferation. (a) The chemical
  structure of LA. (b) KFs were divided into four groups treated with 50, 30, and
  10 μg/ml LA or 10% FBS as a control group for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. The CellTiter-Blue
  cell viability assay showed that LA inhibited cell proliferation. (c) KFs were divided
  into four groups and treated with 40, 20, 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 or 10% FBS as a blank
  control for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. The results showed that TGF-β1 promoted cell proliferation.
  (d, e) KFs were divided into four groups and treated with LA or TGF-β1 for 48 h.
  The RT-qPCR results showed the mRNA levels of Col-I, Col-III, and α-SMA. The data
  were normalized to the control and are presented as the mean ± SEM. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P
  < 0.01 compared with the control group. Each assay was performed in triplicate and
  repeated using four independent cell samples (n = 4, 12 samples).
