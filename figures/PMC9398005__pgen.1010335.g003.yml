figure_title: AOS-like Su(H) alleles induce wing nicking phenotypes that can be enhanced
  or suppressed by genetic changes in the Notch signaling pathway
caption: A. Quantified wing nicking in the indicated genotypes with number of wings
  analyzed (n) noted on each bar graph. Flies used in the top three bars were generated
  by crossing the yw1118 stock that is WT for Su(H) with flies carrying each of the
  indicated Su(H) alleles. Flies used in the bottom three bars were generated by crossing
  flies carrying a Su(H)T4 allele with flies carrying either the Su(H)-GFP BAC, the
  Notch-GFP BAC, or the H1 null allele, as indicated. Proportional odds model with
  Bonferroni adjustment tested for penetrance/severity differences between Su(H)O5/+
  and Su(H)T4/+ flies with ♦ denoting p<0.01. Two-sided Fisher’s exact test was used
  to assess all other genotypes with * denoting p<0.01. B-C. A wing from a Su(H)T4/+
  heterozygote in an otherwise WT background (B) or in combination with a H1/+ heterozygous
  background (Su(H)T4/+;H1/+, C). Note, the Su(H)T4/+ wing had a nick (black arrowhead),
  whereas all the wings from Su(H)T4/+;H1/+ flies did not have wing nicks. D. Quantified
  wing notching in the indicated genotypes with number of wings analyzed (n) noted
  on each bar graph. Flies used in the top four bars were generated by crossing N55e11/+
  female flies with either yw1118 WT male flies or male flies carrying the indicated
  Su(H) alleles. Flies used in the bottom three bars were generated by crossing flies
  carrying the Hairless-GFP (H-GFP) BAC rescue with either yw1118 WT flies or flies
  carrying the indicated Su(H) alleles. Two-sided Fisher’s exact test was used to
  assess penetrance differences between flies with * denoting p<0.01. E-G. Wings from
  female flies containing a copy of the N55e11 allele in either a WT (E), Su(H)T4/+
  (F) or Su(H)O5/+ (G) background. Note, the severe nicking and morphological wing
  phenotypes observed in the compound heterozygotes.
