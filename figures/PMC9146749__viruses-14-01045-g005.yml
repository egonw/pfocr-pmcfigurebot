caption: IBV Nsp14 reduces chJAK1 protein. (A,B) HD11 cells were transfected with
  pcDNA3.1-Flag-Nsp14 (1 μg) or pcDNA3.1-Flag-EV (1 μg). After 24 h, the cells were
  stimulated with chIFN-γ (100 ng/mL) for 6 h. The chJAK1 genes (A) were evaluated
  using the qRT-PCR assay, and the protein level (B) was detected using Western blotting.
  (C) HD11 cells were infected with IBV (MOI = 5) for 0 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h. Western
  blotting was used to detect the chJAK1 and IBV N protein levels. Data were presented
  as means ± SD. ns = not significant.
