caption: Fgf21 promotes the formation of myotubes and regulates MyHC expression and
  signaling pathways in C2C12 cells. C2C12 cells were treated with LV-Con and LV-Fgf21
  for 12 h and then cultured with 2% horse serum for 5 days. (A) Cells were evaluated
  for MyHC I, MyHC IIa, MyHC IIb, TGF-β1, Smad2/3, mmp2, mmp9, and p-p38 by immunoblot
  in C2C12 cells. (B) Data are shown in the bar graph as the fold change of normalized
  proteins of β-actin (mean ± SE). (C) The mRNA expression of MyHC I, MyHC IIa, MyHC
  IIb, TnnT1, TnnT3, MyoD, and MyoG for fiber-type and myogenesis markers were detected
  via real-time qPCR. Results are reported in the bar graph as the fold changes of
  mRNAs normalized to β-actin (mean ± SE). (D) C2C12 cells were evaluated for myotubes
  eMyHC by immunostaining; DAPI staining was used to determine the number of nuclei.
  The eMyHC-positive cells are indicated with red color (mean ± SE, Scale bar in 200
  μm). Bars mean p ≤ 0.05 analyses followed by non-paired Student’s t-test. * p <
  0.05; ** p < 0.01 vs. LV-Con.
