caption: Intratumoral delivery of immRNA suppresses breast cancer growth by triggering
  RIG‐I mediated immune responses. (a) Schematic treatment of mouse 4T1 mammary tumours
  in BALB/c mice with intratumoral delivery of immRNA in RBCEVs. (b) Volume of 4T1
  tumours injected intratumorally with 2.5 mg/kg RBCEVs containing immRNA or NC RNA
  every three days (n = 6 mice). (c) qPCR analysis of the RIG‐I pathway gene expression
  relative to Gapdh in untreated and treated 4T1 tumours (n = 6 mice). (d) Flow cytometry
  analysis of immune cells in untreated and treated 4T1 tumours (n = 6 mice), presented
  as the average percentage of each subset in total cells. NEUT, neutrophils; NK,
  natural killer cells; MΦ, macrophages; DCs, dendritic cells. (e) ELISA quantification
  of IFNβ in the sera of mice with 4T1 tumours (n = 4 mice). (f) qPCR analysis of
  cytokine gene expression relative to Gapdh in untreated and treated 4T1 tumours
  (n = 4 mice). (g) Representative images of TUNEL staining (orange fluorescence)
  of untreated and treated 4T1 tumour sections. Cancer‐associated fibroblasts (green)
  were stained with anti‐αSMA antibody. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst (blue). Scale
  bar, 50 μm. T, Tumour; S, Stroma. (h) Average mean intensity per nucleus area of
  TUNEL staining signals (n = 4 mice). (i) Schematic treatment for human CA1a mammary
  tumours in NSG‐SGM3 mice with intratumoral delivery of immRNA‐loaded RBCEVs. (j)
  Volume of CA1a tumours injected intratumorally with 2.5 mg/kg RBCEVs loaded with
  immRNA or NC RNA every three days (n = 6 mice). (k) qPCR analysis of RIG‐I pathway
  gene expression relative to GAPDH in untreated and treated CA1a tumours (n = 6 mice).
  (l) Flow cytometry analysis of immune cells in untreated and treated CA1a tumours
  (n = 6 mice). All bar graphs represent mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001,
  and ****p < 0.0001 determined by Student's two‐tailed t‐test
