caption: Impact of diabetes on metabolites of the methionine and glutathione pathway,
  and the glutathione redox cycle. Peak area of (a) GSSG, (b) GSH, (c) GSH:GSSG, (d)
  methionine, (e) serine, (f) SAM, (g) cysteine, and (i) γ‐Glu‐Cys in plasma and left
  ventricles from non‐diabetic and diabetic rats. Peak area of (i) homocysteine and
  (j) cystine in plasma from non‐diabetic and diabetic rats. Peak area of (k) Cys‐Gly
  in left ventricles from non‐diabetic and diabetic rats. Values are expressed as
  mean ± SEM (relative to that of the non‐diabetic group, which was expressed as 1
  in each case). N = 6–9 animals. Data analysed by the Mann–Whitney U test. *P < 0.05
  compared with the non‐diabetic group. GSSG, oxidised glutathione; GSH, reduced glutathione;
  SAM, S‐adenosyl‐methionine; γ‐Glu‐Cys, γ‐glutamylcysteine; Cys‐Gly, cysteinylglycine
article_title: Cardioprotective actions of nitroxyl donor Angeli's salt are preserved
  in the diabetic heart and vasculature in the face of nitric oxide resistance.
