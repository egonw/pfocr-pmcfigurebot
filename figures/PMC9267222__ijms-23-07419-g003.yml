caption: G6PD is required for the proliferative advantage of RIP140-deficient cells.
  (A) 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay in
  WT or RIPKO MEFs transfected with shRNA control or shG6PD expression lentivirus.
  The data are normalized to day 1 values for each shRNA and to WT control shRNA.
  Blue asterisks correspond to differences between WT samples, orange ones to differences
  between KO samples, and black ones to differences between WT and KO samples. (B)
  Number of colonies from a colony formation in soft-agar assay of transformed MEF
  WT or RIPKO transfected with shRNA control or G6PD expression lentivirus. The data
  are expressed as percentages of WT shControl samples (shC) (left panel). Pictures
  of colonies in soft agar stained by crystal violet (right panel). (C,D) Cell viability
  assessed by crystal violet staining of MDA-MB-436 cells (C) and MCF7 cells (D) transfected
  with RIP140 siRNA (siRIP) combined with G6PD siRNA. The data are normalized to day
  1 values for each siRNA and then to control siRNA (siC) samples representing the
  growth advantage of siRIP140 transfected cells over siC cells. All experiments were
  conducted at least three times. Values are means Â± SEM; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001, ns = not significant.
