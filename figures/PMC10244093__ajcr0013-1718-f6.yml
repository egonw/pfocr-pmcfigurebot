caption: 'Linc00662 regulated GTF2B-mediated ITGA1 transcription in a m6A-dependent
  manner. A. The subcellular location of Linc00662 was analyzed using FISH. The result
  showed that Linc00662 was localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of PC cells.
  Scale bar: 20 Âµm. B. KEGG enrichment analysis identified focal adhesion as the most
  commonly enriched signaling pathway associated with METTL3. C. Three differentially
  expressed mRNAs were involved in the focal adhesion pathway: integrin alpha-1 (ITGA1),
  JUN, and CCND2. D. The results showed that the knockdown of METTL3 reduced the expression
  of ITGA1 in PC cells using qPCR. E. The results showed that the knockdown of METTL3
  reduced the expression of ITGA1 in PC cells by western blotting. F. The results
  showed that the knockdown of Linc00662 reduced the expression of ITGA1 in PC cells
  using qPCR. G. The results showed that the overexpression of Linc00662 Wt increased
  the expression of ITGA1 but had no effect on the expression of IGF2BP3 in PC cells
  using qPCR. And the overexpression of Linc00662 Mut failed to affect the expressions
  of ITGA1 and IGF2BP3. H. The results showed that the overexpression of Linc00662
  Wt increased the protein expression of ITGA1, but Linc00662 Mut failed and the knockdown
  of Linc00662 reduced the protein expression of ITGA1 by western blotting. I. Correlation
  analysis revealed a positive correlation between Linc00662 and ITGA1 expression
  (P = 5.5e-06) using the online bioinformatics analysis tool (GEPIA). J. The secondary
  structure of GTF2B. K. The proteins pulled down with the Linc00662 probe were examined
  by western blotting and the results showed that GTF2B was a component of the complexes.
  L. The RIP assay confirmed that Linc00662 was enriched in the GTF2B group but not
  in the IgG group. Bar chart showed the fold enrichment of Linc00662 normalized by
  IgG in PC cells. *: P < 0.05. M. Correlation analysis indicated that ITGA1 expression
  was positively related with GTF2B expression (P = 0.001) using the online bioinformatics
  analysis tool (GEPIA). N. GTF2B was knocked down in PC cells using siRNAs and qPCR
  examined the inhibitory efficacy. The result indicated that GTF2B si-1 showed the
  highest inhibitory efficacy. O. GTF2B was knocked down in PC cells using siRNAs
  and western blotting examined the inhibitory efficacy. The result indicated that
  GTF2B si-1 showed the highest inhibitory efficacy. P. The result indicated that
  the knockdown of GTF2B in PC cells reduced the expression of ITGA1using qPCR. Q.
  The result indicated that the knockdown of GTF2B in PC cells reduced the expression
  of ITGA1 by western blotting. R. The result indicated that the overexpression of
  GTF2B increased the expression of ITGA1 in PC cells using qPCR. S. The result indicated
  that the overexpression of GTF2B increased the protein expression of ITGA1 in PC
  cells by western blotting. T. The dual-luciferase reporter assay was conducted to
  examine the transcriptional role of GTF2B on ITGA1 and the role of m6A modification
  in Linc00662 on ITGA1 transcription. The results indicated that GTF2B overexpression
  increased fluorescence intensity, and knockdown of GTF2B decreased fluorescence
  intensity. In addition, the overexpression of Linc00662 Wt increased the fluorescence
  intensity, but Linc00662 Mut failed. Abbreviations: PC: pancreatic cancer, NC: negative
