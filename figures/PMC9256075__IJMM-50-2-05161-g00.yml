caption: 'miR-135 inhibits cell proliferation. Following transfection with miR-135
  mimics or miR-135 inhibitors in (A) MDA-MB-468 and (B) MCF-7 cells, the transfection
  efficiency was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
  The proliferation of cells was determined by (C) MTT and (D) colony formation assay.
  The results were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation of three independent
  experiments. *P<0.05 and **P<0.01 vs. control group. #P<0.05 and ##P<0.01 vs. NC
  group. NC, negative control; miR, microRNA; OD, optical density; GFP, green fluorescent
  protein.'
