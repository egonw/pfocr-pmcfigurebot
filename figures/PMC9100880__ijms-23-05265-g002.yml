caption: The Hedgehog pathway is required for human lung branching morphogenesis.
  (A) Human fetal lung explant cultures at t = 0, t = 24 h and t = 48 h untreated
  (in media alone); or treated with 5 µg/mL IgG as negative control or 5 µg/mL 5E1.
  (B,C) Graphs showing the percentage of distal branching (B) and cyst dilation (C)
  of 5E1, and IgG treated explants as compared to untreated control (CTL) at t = 24
  h and t = 48 h. Results are shown in dots and mean ± SEM (n = 8 for control and
  5E1, n = 6 for IgG). (D–F) RT-qPCR for SHH (D), PTCH1 (E), and HHIP (F) performed
  on control (n = 6), 5E1- (n = 6; red dots) and IgG- treated explants (n = 3). Results
  are shown as individual data points and mean ± SEM. (G) Representative western blots
  for GLI2 and GAPDH in human fetal lung explants treated or not with 5E1 or IgG (5
  µg/mL) for 48 h. (H) Dot plots (mean ± SEM) of western blot densitometry ratios
  for GLI2 normalized to GAPDH (n = 3 for each condition). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01;
  *** p < 0.001; ns = no stress.
