caption: Expression features of GTs and GT‐pathway interaction landscape. (A) The
  proportion of GTs that were aberrantly expressed (left panel, adjusted p < 0.05),
  as well as the proportion of GTs that were significantly associated with patients’
  prognosis in different cancer types (right panel, risky GTs were defined as the
  hazard ratios greater than 1, while protective GTs were defined as the hazard ratios
  lesser than 1). In total, 39% of GTs were identified as risk factors in LGG, followed
  by KIRC, with 30% of GTs being associated with worse overall survival (OS). KIRC
  and UCEC ranked the top in terms of the proportions of GTs that were identified
  as protective factors. (B) Three GTs (ALG3, B3GALT2, and ST6GALNAC3) showed consistent
  expression alterations across 16 cancers (adjusted p < 0.05). (C) GSEA analysis
  of ALG3, B3GALT2, and ST6GALNAC3 (adjusted p < 0.05) in 16 cancer types. The red
  color represents that the GT is significantly associated with this pathway in a
  given cancer type, and deeper red (higher enrichment score) indicates stronger associations.
  The white color indicates that this GT is not associated with the pathway in this
  cancer type. Specifically, the expression change of ALG13 was associated with ribosome
  in 15 cancer types. B3GALT2 was related to cell interaction and immune‐related pathways.
  ST6GALNAC3 was linked with calcium pathway and cell adhesion. (D) GTs with both
  changed expression (|Log2 fold‐change| > 2) and OS relevance. (E) Distribution of
  GT‐relevant pathways across different pathway categories. (F) The number of GTs
  versus the number of pathways in different cancer types. Stronger impacts of GTs
  on cancer‐relevant pathways occurred in LGG, GBM, UCEC, KIRC, PRAD, and LIHC. (G)
  Top 30 GTs‐related biological pathways across cancer types. The right column annotates
  the pathways categories. The left bar represents the total number of GTs involved
  in each pathway across different cancer types. Immune‐related pathways, such as
  chemokine signaling pathway, cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction, leukocyte transendothelial
  migration, antigen processing and presentation, as well as PD‐L1 expression and
  PD‐1 checkpoint pathway, were associated with GTs in various cancer types
