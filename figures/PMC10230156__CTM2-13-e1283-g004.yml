caption: 'HRG suppresses NETs formation via inhibiting NF‐κB and MAPK signalling pathway
  and declining ROS production. (A and B) NET formation by Human neutrophils treated
  with PMA or CM from SK‐hep1 or LM3. (A) Representative images of NETs staining with
  cell‐permeable SYTO Red and cell‐impermeable SYTOX Green and (B) quantification
  of area covered by NETs (n = 9 RMFs from three biologically independent samples).
  Scale bars, 50 μm. (C and D) RNA‐sequence of human neutrophils treated with CM from
  SK‐hep1 (Vector and HRG overexpression) for 8 h. (C) Heatmap of differential expressed
  genes and (D) KEGG pathway analysis. (E) p38 phosphorylation and citH3 in neutrophils
  treated with CM from SK‐hep1, and IL8 blocking antibody or inhibitor of NF‐κB (BAY11‐7028).
  (f and g) ROS level of neutrophils treated with CM from SK‐hep1, and IL8 blocking
  antibody or inhibitor of NF‐κB (BAY11‐7028) or inhibitor of p38 (SB203580). (H and
  I) Hepa1‐6 cells were inoculated into C57BL/6 mice to construct subcutaneous graft
  tumours. Mice were distributed into four groups: anti‐PD‐1 monoclonal antibody combined
  with rHRG group, anti‐PD1 monoclonal antibody group, rHRG group and control group.
  Tumour samples were harvested after 3 weeks. (H) Tumour size and (I) growth curve.
  *p < .05, **p < .01, ***p < .001, by two‐tailed unpaired t‐test.'
