caption: Bioinformatics re-analysis of dataset GSE36331. In RPE cells cocultured with
  activated T-cells, gene sets for inflammatory response, complement, and hypoxia
  were significantly enriched in the RPE_T group compared to the RPE_N group (a-c).
  The normalised enrichment score (NES) is used to compare the enrichment results
  across the gene sets. The y-axis is the enrichment score (ES), and the x-axis represents
  the genes (parallel vertical black lines) included in the gene sets. The green line
  is composed of each ES from the genes. The ES calculated for each gene represents
  the degree of over-expression at the top left or the bottom right along with the
  ranked gene list. The red colour band below represents a positive correlation for
  an enriched pathway. On the contrary, the blue colour is for the negative correlation.
  FDR q-values < 0.05 were considered as significant thresholds. The box plot illustrates
  the differential expression level of C3 between the RPE_N and RPE_T groups (d).
  Nonparametric Wilcoxon test P values are shown on top of the graph, and the boxes
  represent the median and quartiles of the gene expression values.
