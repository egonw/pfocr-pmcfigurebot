caption: 'The value of LINC01268 in auxiliary diagnosis and prognostic evaluation
  of gastric cancer. A: The expression level of LINC01268 in preoperative plasma of
  31 patients with gastric cancer (GC) was higher than that of 19 healthy controls.
  Expression levels were normalized to the ACTB levels. The results were shown as
  the mean Â± SD; B: Construction of receiver operating characteristic curve of LINC01268
  expression level in plasma for diagnosis of GC, area under the curve = 0.840 (95%
  confidence interval: 0.733-0.948, P < 0.0001); C: The prognosis of 39 patients with
  high expression of LINC01268 was worse than that of 23 patients with low expression
  (Log-rank P = 0.047); D: The prognosis of 262 GC patients with high expression of
  LINC01268 in the online database Kaplan-Meier plotter was worse than that of 86
  patients with low expression of LINC01268 (Log-rank P = 0.032). dP < 0.0001. AUC:
  Area under the curve; HR: Hazard ratio.'
