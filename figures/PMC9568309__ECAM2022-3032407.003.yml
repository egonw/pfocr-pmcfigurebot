caption: Effect of ZJW on the expression of the drug resistance-related proteins MDR1/ABCB1,
  MRP4/ABCC4, and ABCG2 in HCT116/L-OHP cells. (a and b) Western blot assay of ABCG2,
  MDR1/ABCB1, and MRP4/ABCC4 proteins in HCT116 cells and HCT116/L-OHP cells treated
  with L-OHP combined with different concentrations of ZJW. (c) Real-time PCR assay
  of ABCG2, MDR1/ABCB1, and MRP4/ABCC4 levels in HCT116 and HCT116/L-OHP cells treated
  with L-OHP combined with different concentrations of ZJW. ∗, P < 0.05; ∗∗, P < 0.01;
  ∗∗∗, P < 0.001 compared to HCT116/L.
