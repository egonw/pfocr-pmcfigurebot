caption: 'Active gp130/STAT3 pathway involved in stemness and invasion of PANC-1 sphere
  cells. PANC-1 cells were cultured for 7 days in 2D (adherent) or 3D (sphere) conditions
  with or without 1 μM SC144. The cells were harvested for use in the described experiments.
  In (E), as described in Materials and Methods, each anticancer drug was added to
  7-day-cultured sphere cells, and the cells were further cultured for 4 days. (A)
  Western blot analysis of p-STAT3 and STAT3. Relative band intensity is presented.
  (B) Phase-contrast image of PANC-1 sphere cells in 96-well ultra-low attachment
  plates at day 7. The histograms show the relative sizes of spheres (control = 100).
  Results are presented as means ± SD from four sphere images. Scale bar: 5 μm. (C)
  ATP assay for growth rate of PANC-1 sphere cells. (D) Real-time qPCR analysis of
  stemness markers. Results are normalized to values obtained for adherent cells (value
  = 1). Results are presented as means ± SD from three independent experiments. (E)
  Anticancer drugs (gemcitabine, 5-FU, or nab-paclitaxel) resistance assay in PANC-1
  sphere cells. The dose-response (10 or 100 μM) of PANC-1 sphere cells to each drug
  was determined using the ATP assay. (F) Real-time qPCR analysis of transporters.
  Results are normalized to values obtained for adherent cells (value = 1). Results
  are presented as means ± SD from three independent experiments. (G) Matrigel invasion
  assays were performed in PANC-1 sphere cells. Representative results from measurements
  of 12 fields are presented. Scale bar: 100 μm. (H) Real-time qPCR analysis of MT1-MMP
  and MMP2. Results are normalized to values obtained for adherent cells (value =
  1). Results are presented as means ± SD from three independent experiments. (I)
  Western blot analysis of MT1-MMP and β-ACTIN. Relative band intensity is presented.
