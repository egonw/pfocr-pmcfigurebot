caption: Treatment with BDX-01 altered the gut microbiota and BA profile and activated
  FXR. (A) Fecal BA profiles of the DSS and BDX-01 groups. (B) Fecal microbiota that
  exhibit a change in BSH activity. (C) Fecal BSH activity. (D) Total BA levels. (E)
  UPBA/CPBA ratio. (F) SBA/PBA ratio. (G) CA/TCA ratio. (H) βMCA/T-βMCA ratio. (I)
  DCA level. (J) LCA level. (K) Heatmap of correlations among predominant bacterial
  taxa and fecal BA in the DSS and BDX-01 groups. (L) The expression of different
  colonic bile acid receptors were determined using western blotting analysis. Data
  represent the means ± SD (n = 3–6). *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p <
  0.0001. OD, optical density.
