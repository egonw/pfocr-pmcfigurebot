caption: NFATC3 is the transcription activator of CTNNB1 promoter. (A) UCSC, Human
  TFDB and JASPAR were applied to predict candidate transcription factors of CTNNB1.
  (B) The knockdown efficacy of sh‐NFATC3#1/2 was tested, and CTNNB1 expression was
  detected when NFATC3 was downregulated through RT‐qPCR assay. (C) The overexpression
  efficiency of pcDNA3.1‐NFATC3 was examined and the expression of CTNNB1 was detected
  in CTNNB1‐upregulated glioma cells through RT‐qPCR assay. (D) ChIP assay was conducted
  to investigate the binding affinity between NFATC3 and CTNNB1 promoter. (E) Luciferase
  reporter assay tested the luciferase activity of CTNNB1 promoter (Wt or Mut) when
  NFATC3 was overexpressed in glioma cells. (F) Western blot was done to explore the
  protein levels of nuclear β‐catenin, CTNNB1, c‐myc and cyclin D1 after NFATC3 was
  inhibited. (G) The luciferase activity of Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway was examined
  with the use of TOP/FOP flash assay when NFATC3 expression was reduced in glioma
  cells. **p < 0.01
