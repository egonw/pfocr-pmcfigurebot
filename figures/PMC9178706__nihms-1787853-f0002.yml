figure_title: Morphotype-biased accessible chromatin regions associate with key metabolic
  pathway genes
caption: a, Heatmaps depicting z-scores of ATAC signal at the s-CREs (top panel) and
  c-CREs (bottom panel). The numbers in parentheses indicate the number of peaks in
  the corresponding panel of the heatmap. b, Heatmaps depicting z-scores for expression
  of genes associated to s-CREs and c-CREs. c,d, Pathways/reactomes (using GSEA) enriched
  in genes in proximity (<10 kb of TSS) of s-CREs (c) and c-CREs (d) and showing the
  same bias in expression. The figures in parentheses represent the number of genes
  in our list / total number of genes in that reactome. The x-axis represents fold
  change, and the colors of the bars reflect the FDR value as shown in the color panel
  on the right side. PI, phosphatidylinositol; PIPs, phosphatidylinositol phosphates.
  e, Expression levels of genes associated with s-CREs belonging to ‘lipid metabolism
  (catabolism)’ and ‘circadian rhythm’ reactomes. The graph represents average values
  +/− s.d. from n = 2 biologically independent RNA-seq experiments. P-values are derived
  from edgeR and are adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing. lipca, hepatic triacylglycerol
  lipase a; lpl, lipoprotein lipase; apoa1b, apolipoprotein 1a; per1b, period 1b;
  cry1b, cryptochrome circadian regulator 1b. f, Expression levels of genes associated
  with c-CREs belonging to ‘lipid metabolism (anabolism)’. The graph represents average
  values +/− s.d. from n = 2 biologically independent RNA-seq experiments. P-values
  are derived from edgeR and are adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing. aacs, acetoacetyl-CoA
  synthetase; acsl1a, long-chain-fatty-acid-CoA ligase 1; acss2l, acyl-CoA synthetase
  short chain family member 2; fasn, fatty acid synthase. g, Motifs enriched in s-CREs.
  CTCF, CCCTC binding factor; LXRE, liver X receptor; NFkb, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells p50–52 subunits; RAR:RXR, retinoic acid receptor:retinoic X
  receptors; HNF4a, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4a. h, Motifs enriched in c-CREs. KLF14,
  Krüppel-like factor; ETS, E26 transformation-specific; c-Myc, cellular myelocytomatosis
  oncogene; Nfy, nuclear transcription factor Y. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.005 using two-tailed
  Student’s t-test.
