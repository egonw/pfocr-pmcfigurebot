caption: Silencing endogenous Sirt6 expression promotes Ang II‐induced mitochondrial
  injury and apoptosis in podocytes. (A) Representative image of mitochondrial morphology
  in podocytes stimulated with Ang II for 24 h as assessed by MitoTracker Red staining.
  Scale bar = 3 μm. (B and C) Average length and aspect ratio of podocyte mitochondria
  in each group. (D and E) The mitochondrial potential of podocytes under different
  conditions was detected via JC‐1 staining. Scale bar = 100 μm. (F) Comparison of
  ATP production levels in different groups. (G) Fluorescence intensity of MitoSOX
  Red staining of cells in different groups. (H and I) Analysis of cell apoptosis
  among different groups. *p < 0.05, n = 5
article_title: Sirt6 deficiency contributes to mitochondrial fission and oxidative
  damage in podocytes via ROCK1‐Drp1 signalling pathway.
