caption: 'SALL4 induces proliferation by following PI3K/AKT pathway. (A,B) RT-qPCR
  and Western blot results show the overexpression efficiency of a plasmid (pcDNA3.1+/SALL4)
  for SALL4 in both HER2+ cell lines such as BT474 and SKBR3. (C,D) The proliferation
  of BT474 and SKBR3 cells with overexpression of SALL4 was measured by WST assay
  at 7 days. The graph shows the results of three independent experiments. Student’s
  t-test compared the results. * p-value ≤ 0.05, ** p-value ≤ 0.01 and *** p-value
  ≤ 0.001. (E,F) Protein expression levels were analyzed by Western blot following
  72 h of transfection of plasmid for overexpression of SALL4. Expressions of PI3K/AKT
  pathway proteins, including PI3K, phospho-PI3 kinase (Tyr458 and Tyr199), phospho-Akt
  (Ser473), PTEN and BCL2 were shown. GAPDH expression was used as an internal control.
  The densitometry quantification was obtained by normalizing to GAPDH and for quantifying
  phosphorylation protein the data were obtained by taking the ratio of phosphorylated
  protein upon total protein. EV: Empty Vector: OE: Overexpression of SALL4.T: trastuzumab
