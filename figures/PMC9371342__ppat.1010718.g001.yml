figure_title: A summary of the major components of the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways
  of apoptosis induction following viral infection
caption: In response to viral infection, the extrinsic pathway is initiated by death
  receptors following stimulation by the TNF proteins, resulting in downstream signaling
  and caspase-8 activation. The intrinsic pathway of apoptosis arises from proapoptotic
  stimuli, subsequently initiating mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and activation
  of caspase-9. Both pathways converge at the terminal activation of caspase-3 that
  executes apoptosis. ATF4, activating transcription factor 4; ATF6, activating transcription
  factor 6; BAK, BCL-2 antagonist or killer; BAX, BCL-2-associated X protein; cGAS/STING,
  cyclic GMP–AMP synthetase/stimulator of IFN genes; CHOP, CCAAT-enhancer-binding
  protein homologous protein; DISC, death-inducing signaling complex; EBV, Epstein–Barr
  virus; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FMDV, Foot-and-mouth disease virus; HBV, hepatitis
  B virus; IRE1, inositol-requiring enzyme 1; IRF3, IFN-regulatory factor 3; JEV,
  Japanese encephalitis virus; MVA, modified vaccinia virus; PERK, PKR-like ER kinase;
  RIG-I, retinoic acid-inducible gene I; TLR3, Toll-like receptor 3; TNF, tumor necrosis
  factor; TRIF, Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adapter inducing IFN-beta; WNV,
  West Nile virus.
