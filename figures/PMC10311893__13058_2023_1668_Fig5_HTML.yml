caption: The top network by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis using differentially expressed
  genes (Q < 0.1) according to the lesion type in ER-positive cancer. ESR1, BIRC5,
  CAV1, FGFR1, IL6, MIR27, and PTTG1 were upregulated with direct or indirect interactions
  between them. The top functions of this network included cell cycle, cellular growth
  and proliferation with a score of 11. The network is presented graphically by nodes
  (gene–gene products) and edges (biological interactions between nodes). The shape
  of the nodes indicates the functional class of the gene product, and the node color
  intensity indicates the degree of up- (red or orange) and down- (green or blue)
  regulation. ER = estrogen receptor, ESR = Estrogen Receptor 1, BIRC5 = Baculoviral
  IAP Repeat Containing 5, CAV1 = Caveolin 1, FGFR1 = Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor
  1, IL6 = Interleukin 6, MIR27 = MicroRNA 27a, PTTG1 = PTTG1 Regulator of Sister
