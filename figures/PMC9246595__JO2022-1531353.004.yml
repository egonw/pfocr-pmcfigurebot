caption: Osimertinib inhibits the expression of PD-L1 in endothelial cells via the
  AKT/ERK pathway. (a) Western blot analysis showed that the expressions of p-AKT
  and p-ERK were decreased in osimertinib-treated HUVECs. (b) Statistical analysis
  results of p-AKT/AKT and p-ERK/ERK. (c) Blocking AKT can reduce the expression of
  PD-L1. (d) Statistical results of each group of proteins.  ∗ ∗P < 0.01.
