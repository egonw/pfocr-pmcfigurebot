caption: Main characteristics of the UPR response. (A) The cell phenotype of ER stressed,
  normally is the appearance of the “scrambled egg” that correspond to paraptosis,
  a classical look of the ER cisternae dilated. (B) Details of the UPR response given
  by the three RE stress sensors (PERK, ATF6, IRE1). PERK phosphorylates (P, green
  circle) NRF2 and eIF2α. In the first case, the antioxidant pathway is activated,
  and in the second case, protein synthesis is blocked. The ATF6 pathway is formed
  by the ATF6A and ATF6B genes that encode the ATF6α and β proteins, respectively.
  After its activation, the ATF6α protein is exported to the Golgi apparatus, where
  it undergoes a maturation process, releasing an active protein called ATF6αf, with
  a DNA binding domain. ATF6αf translocates to the nucleus, where it increases transcription
  of the proteins GRP78/BiP, CHOP, and XBP1, among others. ATF6 can interact with
  XBP1 to form a heterodimer and activate some genes of the ERAD system. Finally,
  persistent and unresolved ER stress leads to autophosphorylation (P, green circle)
  of IRE1α which increases its function as RNase and degrades a wide range of RNAs.
  It also generates the splicing of XBP1, whose function is to regulate the expression
  of genes directly related to the ER. The IRE1α protein also interacts with TRAF2
  to activate and facilitate apoptosis. CHOP and XBP1 show the convergence of the
  three pathways of stress response.
