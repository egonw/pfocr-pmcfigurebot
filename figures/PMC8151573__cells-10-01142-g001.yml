caption: The signaling pathway in FAP regulation. (a) Regulation of FAP expression
  via the TGFÎ² signaling pathway in GBM cells; (b) downstream signaling pathway regulated
  by activated FAP heterodimers leading to various effects on cancer cells, including
  proliferation and invasion, immunosuppression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition
  (EMT).
