caption: 'Representative photomicrographs of hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections
  from the left ventricular myocardium in the different experimental groups: (a) Group
  I (control group) showed anastomosing and branching cardiac muscle fibers. The cardiomyocytes
  displayed central vesicular oval nuclei (N) and acidophilic cytoplasm. The flat
  dark nuclei (arrow) of the endomysium connective tissue fibroblasts are shown; (b)
  Group IIa (DOX/Trz group) showed disrupted and separated myofibers with intracytoplasmic
  vacuolization (V), hyaline degeneration, and Zenkerâ€™s necrosis (*) and pyknosis
  (arrowhead) of many cardiomyocyte nuclei. Notice the accumulation of inflammatory
  cells (I) among the myofibers; (c) Group IIb (recovery group) showed separated,
  thinly stretched myofibers with the absence of striation (W), cytoplasmic vacuolization
  (V), and pyknosis (arrowhead) of numerous cardiomyocyte nuclei; (d) Group III (prophylactic
  group) showed a nearly normal histological architecture, with acidophilic cytoplasm
  and vesicular, oval centrally located nuclei (N). Notice the regularly arranged
  muscle fibers with narrow spacing; and (e) Group IV (curative group) showed slightly
  disorganized cardiac muscle fibers with slight narrow spacing between the myofibers
  (W); n = 6.'
