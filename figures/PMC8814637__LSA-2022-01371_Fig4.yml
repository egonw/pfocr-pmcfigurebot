figure_title: Immune profile changes and corresponding drug targets for SARS-CoV-2
  and MERS-CoV infection
caption: '(A) Biological process enrichment analysis for 75 proteins that mimic viral
  translation in both PTC and DTC upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. BiNGO Cytoscape plugin
  was used to create enrichment network. Major pathway sub-groups are highlighted.
  Color bar represents adjusted P-value for BiNGO enrichment. (B) SARS-CoV-2 immune
  response profile in renal epithelial cells compared with Caco-2 cell line (). Immune
  system process (GO: 0002376, Proteins in subset = 3,315) GO-term was used for the
  comparison. The total number of quantified proteins (n) across the conditions are
  indicated along with number of significantly changing proteins given inside the
  circles and corresponding histograms showing directionality of change - “up”: increased
  abundance and “down”: decreased abundance. (C) Temporal distribution profiles of
  significantly changed immune system process (GO: 0002376) proteins in response to
  SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV infection in PTC and DTC. Data are represented with a quantitative
  distribution of the mean log2 fold-changes (FC). (C, D) Proteins from the 48 hpi
  subsets (from (C)) that had a corresponding drug target in the ChEMBL database.
  Proteins were locally clustered in three sub-groups with four selected STRING enrichments
  (STRING plugin for Cytoscape). (D, E) Protein–drug network based on (D). Selected
  data for most interesting drug candidates and corresponding protein targets are
  shown (complete network and drug target list in ). Red squares indicate small molecular
  compound drug candidates available for shown target proteins. Significance cutoff:
  −0.5 ≥ log2 fold-change ≥ 0.5, P-value ≤ 0.05.'
