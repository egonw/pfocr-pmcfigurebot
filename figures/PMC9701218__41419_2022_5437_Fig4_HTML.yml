figure_title: PandaOmics Target ID approach to identify targets in sarcoma patients
  and in vitro target validation
caption: A Top 20 most promising targets for sarcoma patients with high expression
  of CEP135 vs adjacent normal samples derived from the In silico Target ID scoring
  approach. B Visualization of the pathway activation analysis for sarcoma patients
  with high CEP135 expression vs. low CEP135 expression for “Regulation of PLK1 Activity
  at G2-M Transition” (R-HSA-2565942) signaling pathway. All the nodes where CEP135
  is encountered are highlighted with red circles. The coloring of the overall diagram
  corresponds to upregulation and downregulation of the particular nodes based on
  the gene expression changes and is colored as green and red respectively. C U2OS
  cells were incubated with corresponding siRNAs followed by staining with DAPI for
  nuclei quantification. Data are presented as absolute DAPI counts for three independent
  sets. The error bars show the error of mean. (**p-value < 0.01, non-parametric ttest).
