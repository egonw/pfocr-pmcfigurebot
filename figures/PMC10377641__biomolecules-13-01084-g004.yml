caption: Schematic representation of the current strategies to impair leptin/leptin
  receptor signaling. In obese patients, hypertrophic and hyperplastic adipose tissue
  expansion leads to an increased local and systemic production of the adipokine leptin.
  Leptin, through the binding to its own receptor (ObR) expressed on cancer cell surface
  activates the canonical JAK2/STAT3 signal transduction pathway, with consequently
  induction of transcriptional machinery of several key genes determinant for tumor
  progression (A). Leptin mutants (B), neutralizing antibodies against leptin (C)
  or leptin receptor (D), leptin receptor antagonists (mainly small peptide) have
  been developed to block leptin/leptin receptor signaling (E).
