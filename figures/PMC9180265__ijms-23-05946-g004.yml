caption: CK promotes the JA pathway in response to BPH in rice. (A) Transcript levels
  of JA-pathway-related genes in rice sheaths pretreated with 0.1 µM 6-BA or mock
  treatment post infestation with BPH for 24 h, respectively. The expression levels
  of mock-treated plants were set as 1. Ubiquitin was used as an internal reference.
  (C–E) Contents of JA and conjugates of JA in rice sheaths pretreated with 0.1 µM
  6-BA or mock treatment, respectively, and infested with BPH for 24 h. JA-Ile, Jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine;
  JA-Val, N-[(-)-Jasmonoyl]-(L)-valine. (B) Transcript levels of SA-pathway-related
  genes in rice sheaths pretreated with 6-BA or mock treatment at 24 h post infestation
  with BPH, respectively. (F,G) Contents of SA and salicylic acid 2-O-β-Glucoside
  (SAG) in rice sheaths pretreated with 6-BA or mock treatment at 24 h post infestation
  with BPH, respectively. FW, fresh weight. Values are means ± SD, n = 3. Statistical
  significances were determined by two-tailed Student’s t-test, * p < 0.05, ** p <
  0.01, ns, no significant difference.
