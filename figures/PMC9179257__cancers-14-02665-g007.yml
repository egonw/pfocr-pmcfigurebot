caption: The effects of FDLE on NF-κB-mediated expression of apoptotic proteins and
  activation of caspase enzymes in non-inflammatory and inflammatory HCT-116 and HT-29
  colorectal cancer cell lines by Western blot. (A,B) The expression of apoptotic
  proteins and the activation of caspase enzymes in non-inflammation HCT-116 and HT-29
  cells untreated and treated with three doses (50, 100 and 200 µg/mL) of FDLE or
  BEZ235 for 48 h. (C,D) The expression of apoptotic proteins and the activation of
  caspase enzymes in inflammation HCT-116 and HT-29 cells untreated and treated with
  three doses (50, 100 and 200 µg/mL) of FDLE for 48 h after adding cytokines (TNF-α,
  IFN-γ and LPS each 10 ng/mL) for 2 h. Densitometric quantification was performed
  by image software. The results were represented as mean ± SD of three independent
  experiments, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001. The whole
  western blots are shown in .
