caption: 'PUE changed the level of enzymatic activity related to oxidative stress
  in HT22 cells. (A-E) The levels of SOD, MDA, CAT, GSH, and GSH-px were measured
  by the corresponding kits. All data are expressed as mean ± SD (n = 6). ##p < 0.01
  vs. control group, *p < 0.05 or **p < 0.01 vs. OGD/R group, △p < 0.05 or △△p < 0.01
  vs. PUE group.'
