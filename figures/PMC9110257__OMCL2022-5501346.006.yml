caption: Gene expression is altered in KGN cells after LARS2 knockdown. (a) Volcano
  plots for RNA-seq comparing si-LARS2 and si-NC KGN cell line. Red spot represents
  –log2 (P-value) ≥0; blue spot represents the -log2 (P-value) <0. (b) Heatmap for
  differentially expressed genes in KGN after transfected with si-LARS2 or si-NC.
  The color spectrum ranging from red to blue indicates normalized levels of gene
  expression from high to low. The inclusion criteria of were |–log10 | < 1. (c) GO
  enrichment of differentially expressed genes between si-LARS2 and control KGN cells.
  (d) KEGG pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes in si-LARS2 compared
  to control. (e) The enrichment analysis of human disease-related genes using the
  Disease Ontology method. The data are presented as mean ± SD from three independent
  experiments. ∗P < 0.05.
