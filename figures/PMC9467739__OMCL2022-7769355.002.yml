caption: 'QCT inhibited Erastin-induced ferroptosis in M17 cells by activating the
  Nrf2 pathway. (a) Representative immunoblots for SLC7A11, FTH, and GPX4 proteins
  from M17 cells treated with or without QCT (10 μM, 1 h), followed by Erastin (1 μM,
  12 h) treatment. (b–d) Quantification of SLC7A11, FTH, and GPX4 protein levels (n
  = 3). (e, f) Representative immunoblots for nuclear and total Nrf2 protein levels
  from M17 cells treated with or without QCT (10 μM, 1 h), followed by Erastin (1 μM,
  12 h) treatment. (f, g) Quantification of nuclear and total Nrf2 protein levels
  (n = 3). Immunofluorescence analysis of M17 cells treated with or without QCT (10 μM,
  1 h), followed by Erastin (1 μM, 12 h) treatment, stained with Nrf2 antibody (green)
  and DAPI (blue). Scale bar = 50 μm. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. One-way ANOVA
  followed by Tukey''s post hoc test. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001; ns:
  no significant difference.'
