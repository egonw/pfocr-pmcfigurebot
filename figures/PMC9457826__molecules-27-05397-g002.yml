caption: Cell proliferative effect of components from C. bignonioides fruits on mouse
  myoblasts. (A) Cytotoxicity measured by MTT colorimetric assay for 50 μM concentration
  of compound 1–15 isolated from C. bignonioides on C2C12 cells. (B) Cell proliferation
  activity measured by BrdU assay of compound 1–8 and 10–15 at 50 μM concentration
  on C2C12 cells during the differentiation period. Data are reported as mean ± SEM,
  obtained from at least triplicate determinations. *** indicates p < 0.001 calculated
  by one-way ANOVA.
