caption: 'Comparison of HercepTest (mAb) (HcT) and PATHWAY 4B5 (4B5) with respect
  to IHC scores and FISH status. A According to ASCO/CAP IHC scoring, all ISH positive
  cases (filled symbols) were scored IHC 3 + or IHC 2 + by using HcT. In two of the
  ISH positive tumors, 4B5 was IHC 1 + (red circle). B Detailed analysis of 53 tumors
  scored as IHC 0 according to ASCO/CAP by 4B5 (see cases within blue frames in A)
  with 41 tumors showing no staining and 12 cases with HER2 expression in < 10% of
  cells (grey area). Using HcT, 16 cases were shifted up to IHC score 1 + and in 3
  cases to IHC 2 + (matching to HER2-low category). Fourteen cases were shifted from
  no staining by 4B5 to some staining (< 10%, grey zone) by HcT (matching to HER2
  ultra-low category: 0 < 1 +). IHC scores were unchanged in 20 cases (19 IHC 0, 1
  IHC 0 < 1 +)'
