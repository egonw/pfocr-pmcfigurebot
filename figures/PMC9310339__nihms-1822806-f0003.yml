caption: 'Phagocytosis-related biological functions are overrepresented in irradiated
  p38 transgenic mice. Significant phagocytosis-related diseases or functions among
  genes differentially expressed in irradiated WT, DKI, and DN mice as identified
  by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Biological functions displaying a z-score â‰¥ 2 and
  showing Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted P value < 0.05 were considered significant.
  Abbreviations, WT: p38 wild-type; DKI: p38 double knock-in mutant; DN: p38 dominant
  negative.'
