figure_title: Relationship between the presence of the three nucleoside metabolic
  pathways and phylogenetic positions of halophilic archaea
caption: The phylogenetic tree was constructed using 16S rRNA gene sequences. A sequence
  from Thermoplasma volcanium (tvo) was used as an outgroup. The colors of the circles
  correspond to those of the nucleoside metabolic pathways in Fig. . Organisms shown
  in red and pink codes indicate the halophilic archaea shown in Fig. . The organisms
  in red codes show those whose proteins were actually examined in this study.
