caption: Abnormally activated signaling pathways in the two subgroups after Gene Set
  Enrichment Analysis. (a–d) Performed in the high-risk group, including unfolded
  protein response (ES = 0.42, P=0.02, FDR = 0.110), DNA repair signaling pathway
  (ES = 0.41, P=0.0096, FDR = 0.070), epithelial-mesenchymal transition signaling
  pathway (ES = 0.55, P=0.032, FDR = 0.337), and glycolysis pathway (ES = 0.44, P=0.032,
  FDR = 0.087). (e–f) Performed in the low-risk group, including estrogen response
  early (ES = 0.40, P=0.038, FDR = 1.0) and KRAS signaling pathway (ES = 0.40, P=0.039,
  FDR = 1.0).
