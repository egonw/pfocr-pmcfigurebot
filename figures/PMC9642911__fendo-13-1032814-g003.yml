caption: Gene Ontology pathway enrichment analysis. Result of GO pathway enrichment
  analysis of the 80 common DEGs, the dot plot (A) and bar plot (B). Biological process
  (BP), cellular component (CC), and molecular function (MF) analysis results of 80
  common DEGs, the dot plot (C) and bar plot (D). X-axis represents the proportion
  of DEGs and Y-axis on behalf of the different categories. The size of the circle
  manifests the number of genes enriched in each category and different properties
  are denoted by the color of the circle.
