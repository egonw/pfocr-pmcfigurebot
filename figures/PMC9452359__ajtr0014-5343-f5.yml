caption: Effect of KN-93 and OA on the proliferation of SOD1G93A mutant NSC-34 cells
  after overexpression and knockdown of Wnt5a. A, B. Representative images of EdU-positive
  cells obtained under a fluorescence microscope. Scale bar = 20 Î¼m. C. Bar chart
  showing that KN-93 treatment for 48 h reversed the raised proliferation of NSC-34
  cells after co-transfecting pcDNA3.1-Wnt5a and pcDNA3.1-G93A-SOD1 plasmids. D. Bar
  chart showing that OA treatment for 48 h reversed the decreased proliferation of
  NSC-34 cells after co-transfecting siRNA-Wnt5a and pcDNA3.1-G93A-SOD1 plasmids.
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 vs. pcDNA3.1-Con and pcDNA3.1-G93A-SOD1, siRNA-Con and pcDNA3.1-G93A-SOD1.
