figure_title: Enzymatic cellulose-to-glucose conversion of SCOP lines
caption: Before the saccharification, stem segments were pretreated with 62.5 mM NaOH
  at 90°C for 3 hours. (A) Released glucose was expressed as a percentage of the total
  cellulose in the respective lines. Saccharification was ended after 72 hours. At
  each time point, cellulose-to-glucose yield was significantly higher in both SCOP
  lines as compared to that of WT. Significance levels are indicated by ● and * for
  SCOP-1 and SCOP-2 lines, respectively, compared to WT [* and ●, 0.05 > P > 0.01;
  ** and ●●, 0.01 > P > 0.001; *** and ●●●, P < 0.001 (ANOVA followed by post hoc
  Tukey test; n = 10)]. (B) Biomass of SCOP lines and controls after 62.5 mM NaOH
  pretreatment and 72 hours of enzymatic hydrolysis. SCOP stem pieces are structurally
  degraded, whereas those of WT remain largely intact. Scale bars, 4 mm.
