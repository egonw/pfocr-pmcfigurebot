figure_title: Basal Ganglia Motor Regulatory Functions
caption: 'Figure illustrating the normal pathway of dopaminergic potentiation upon
  the basal ganglia leading to modulation of cortical motor activity. A deprivation
  in D2 activity will lead to overt activation of the indirect inhibitory pathway
  causing decreased movement, involuntary hypertonia, and rigid muscle. Synergistically,
  a lack of D1 activity in the direct excitatory pathway will also promote decreased
  movement and rigidity. The cortical structures are represented by color-coded locations
  and the included figure legends identify the structures accordingly.(Abbreviations:
  SNpc: substantia nigra pars compacta, GPi: globus pallidus interna, GPe: globus
  pallidus externa, STN: subthalamic nuclei, GABA: gamma-aminobutyric acid, D1: dopamine-1
  receptor, D2: dopamine-2 receptor)'
