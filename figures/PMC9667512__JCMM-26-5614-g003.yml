caption: Enrichment analysis. (A and B) gene ontology (GO) (A) and kyoto encyclopedia
  of genes and genomes (KEGG) (B) enrichment analysis of all the integrated DEGs from
  the three GSE dataset. p value <0.05 and q value <0.05 were set as the thresholds
  for GO enrichment terms, while p value <0.05 and q value <0.2 were set as the significance
  cutoff criterion for KEGG pathway enrichment. Top 20 significant terms are shown
