caption: 'SARS-CoV-2 Infection Upregulates Type I IFN Signaling, Inflammatory Pathways,
  and Vasoactive Genes in Cardiac Pericytes(A to G) RNA sequencing of pericytes at
  4 dpi. Cardiac pericytes from 3 donors were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 mNeonGreen
  (5 technical replicates/donor) or mock (3 technical replicates/donor). (A) Multidimensional
  scaling plot with mock (red) and SARS-CoV-2 infected (CoV2) (green) samples; dots
  represent technical replicates. (B) Volcano plot showing differentially expressed
  genes between mock and infected samples. Each dot represents a gene, with blue denoting
  down-regulated genes, black denoting genes nonsignificant changes, and red denoting
  up-regulated genes. (C) Gene ontology pathway analysis with top 10 up-regulated
  pathways in infected pericytes. (D to G) Heat maps of selected differentially expressed
  genes of viral origin (D), pericyte genes involved in inflammatory response (E);
  response to IFN signaling (F); and vascular development, homeostasis, and function
  (G). (H to J) Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses
  of genes encoding inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (H), type I interferon signaling
  pathway components (I), and vasoconstriction and angiogenesis mediators (J); data
  points denote separate wells (3 technical replicates/donor) with statistical comparison
  to mock group for each donor; an equal or unequal variance Student''s t-test, as
  determined by an F test for equality of 2 variances: ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01; ∗∗∗P <
  0.001, nonsignificant comparisons not shown. GAPDH = glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; other abbreviations as in .'
