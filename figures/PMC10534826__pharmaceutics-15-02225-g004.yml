caption: Changes to GSH detoxification and the PPP secondary to opioid treatment.
  GSH detoxification is a vital cellular process involved in the neutralization of
  reactive oxygen compounds and maintenance of redox balance. Opioids were found to
  impact this pathway by influencing GSH levels and the activity of GSH-related enzymes,
  such as GPx and glutathione-S-transferase. Studies suggest that chronic opioid use
  can lead to a decrease in GSH levels and impair the efficiency of GSH detoxification,
  potentially contributing to oxidative stress and cellular damage. To indicate the
  directionality of change in metabolite or protein levels, brackets preceding the
  study authorship are used. The accompanying figure illustrates the alterations induced
  by morphine treatment, with the exception of those marked with a “#” signifying
  changes attributable to midazolam and propofol, or a “*” signifying changes resulting
  from dexmedetomidine administration. HK—hexokinase; GK—glucokinase; G6PDH—glucose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; GSH—glutathione (reduced form); GSSG—glutathione disulfide (oxidized
  form); GPx—glutathione peroxidase; GR—glutathione reductase; NADPH—nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced form); NADP+—nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate (oxidized form); GNL—gluconolactonase; 6PGD—6-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase;
  R5PI—ribose-5-phosphate isomerase; R5P3E—ribose-5-phosphate-3-epimerase; TK—transketolase;
  TAL—transaldolase [,,,,,,,,,].
