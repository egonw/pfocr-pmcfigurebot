caption: Cell cycle-related factors associated with cancer were affected by carboline.
  (A) The Venn diagram displays the common genes shared by the SARC and predicted
  drug-target profiles. (B) PPI network analysis of 19 hub genes. The network was
  constructed using the CytoHubba plugin in Cytoscape, and the core gene scores were
  calculated using the maximal clique centrality (MCC) method. The deeper the color
  of the node is, the higher the PPI score of the targets, and the red nodes represent
  the β-carboline-3-carboxylic acid dimers. (C) KEGG pathway analysis of 24 targets
  from Venn analysis. (D) Differential and functional enrichment analysis of 24 targets
  shared by SARC-related transcriptomic profiles and drug-target networks. (E) Disease-free
  survival analysis for predicted target genes and TCGA consensus genes, P <0.05 (CCNA2,
  PLK1, and TK1). (F) mRNA expression of CCNA2, DBF4, TK1, PLK1, MMP7, and CDK2 in
  MG-63 cells detected by RT–qPCR. (G) Western blot analysis of CCNA2 and CDK2. MG-63
  cells were treated with Comp1 and Comp2 at 5 and 10 µM for 48 h. ACTB was used as
  an internal control. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
