caption: Integrin β3 and AXL were significantly upregulated in NSCLC tissues after
  the development of acquired erlotinib resistance. (A) Representative images of integrin
  β3 and AXL immunostaining in NSCLC tissues before erlotinib treatment and after
  acquired erlotinib resistance. (B) IHC score demonstrated stronger immunostaining
  of integrin β3 and AXL in six pairs of NSCLC tissues after the appearance of erlotinib
  resistance. Data represented the means ± SEM, * p < 0.05. Scale bar, 100 μm.
