caption: 'Expression level of the genes from the initial portion of the flavonoid
  pathway during development of F. chiloensis fruit and in response to ABA treatment.
  Fruit at C2 stage was immersed in 1 mM ABA or 100 µM FLD (short-term treatment)
  or fruit pedicel was submerged in 1 mM ABA or only buffer (longer-time treatment).
  Changes in the expression level of each gene during fruit development are shown
  on the left-hand side of the figure; in the center the effect of ABA/FLD in the
  short term-treatment; on the right-hand side the effect of ABA in the long-term
  treatment. Gene expression levels of the flavonoid pathway were quantified through
  qPCR analysis: FcCHS, chalcone synthase (A–C); FcCHI, chalcone isomerase (D–F);
  FcF3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase (G,H); FcF3′H, flavonoid-3′-hydroxylase (I–K). In
  expression analysis during development progress of F. chiloensis, different letters
  indicate significant differences between fruit stages (one-way ANOVA with Dunnett
  correction post hoc). In ABA short-term treatments, asterisks or circles indicate
  significant differences compared to time 0 for each hormone/inhibitor treatment
  (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01; one-way ANOVA with Dunnett correction post hoc). For ABA
  long-term treatment, asterisks indicate significant differences between treatments
  (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001), different letters indicate significant
  differences between days of ABA treatment; two-way ANOVA with Tukey correction post
  hoc test was used.'
