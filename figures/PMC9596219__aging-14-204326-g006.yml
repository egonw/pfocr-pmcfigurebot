caption: Abnormal alternative splicing of KITLG activates the ERK signaling pathway.
  (A and B) Agarose gel electrophoresis demonstrated the transfer efficiency on different
  isoforms of KITLG in both HEK293 and MM cells. (C and D) WB test verified that phosphorylated
  ERK expression was enhanced in KITLG isoform1-OE cells and downregulated in KITLG
  isoform2-OE cells.
article_title: DAZAP1 facilitates the alternative splicing of KITLG to promote multiple
  myeloma cell proliferation via ERK signaling pathway.
