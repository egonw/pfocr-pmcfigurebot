caption: Impacts of GhIQD1 on JA, ABA, and SA signaling pathways. (A) JA differentially
  expressed genes in the transcriptome; (B) JA pathway marker genes in cotton and
  tobacco after infection with V. dahliae; (C) ABA differentially expressed genes
  in transcriptomes; (D) ABA pathway marker genes in cotton and tobacco after infection
  with V. dahlia; (E) SA differentially expressed genes in transcriptomes; (F) SA
  pathway marker genes in cotton and tobacco after infection with V. dahliae; (G)
  JA content in leaves of TRV::00 plants and TRV::GhIQD1 plants 48 h after V. dahliae
  exposure; (H) ABA content in leaves of TRV::00 plants and TRV::GhIQD1 plants 48
  h after V. dahliae exposure; (I) SA content in leaves of TRV::00 plants and TRV::GhIQD1
  plants 48 h after V. dahliae exposure; Values are the mean and standard deviation
  (SD). Error bars represent the SD. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; Studentâ€™s
  t-test. All experiments were repeated in at least triplicate.
