caption: The expression of SECTM1 in glioma is associated with the survival and prognosis
  of patients. A-C refers to the correlation between the expression of SECTM1 and
  the survival of glioma (A), LGG (B) and GBM (C) patients in the CGGA database by
  Kaplan-Meier analysis, while the expression of SECTM1 in the TCGA database by Kaplan-Meier
  analysis and the survival of glioma patients (D). E-F was the ROC curve of prognostic
  models in CGGA database (E) and TGGA database (F) to analyze the correlation between
  SECTM1 and the prognosis of glioma patients, and the expression of SECTM1 in CGGA
  database to analyze the correlation with glioma grade, gender, age, IDH mutation,
  1p19q chromosome deletion and other factors (G).
article_title: SECTM1 promotes the development of glioblastoma and mesenchymal transition
  by regulating the TGFÎ²1/Smad signaling pathway.
