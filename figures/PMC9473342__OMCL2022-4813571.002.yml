caption: 'DSC2 suppressed the migration and invasion of GC cells in vitro and in vivo.
  After stably overexpressing DSC2 gene, the migration and invasion of MGC-803 cells
  were detected by scratch wound-healing assay ((a) 60×), transwell migration assay
  ((b) 200×), and transwell invasion assay ((c) 200×). The expression of EMT-related
  proteins (E-cadherin, N-cadherin, CD44, MMP9, MMP2, and MMP3) were performed by
  Western blot assay (d). Data are presented as mean ± SD from three separate experiments.
  ∗∗p < 0.01 and ∗∗∗p < 0.001 vs. BC. ##p < 0.01 and ###p < 0.001 vs. Lenti-NC group.
  (e) Presentative IVIS imaging for tumor metastasis models. (f) At day 30, mice were
  sacrificed, and the lungs were removed and performed HE staining, the scale bar
  = 100 μm. (g) Mice weight were measured every 3 days after tail vein injection of
  MGC-803 cells. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 5). ∗∗p < 0.01 vs. sgRNA-NC,
  ##p < 0.01 vs. Lenti-NC.'
