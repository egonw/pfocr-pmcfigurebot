caption: 'Colesevelam reduces the hydrophobicity of the bile acid pool in Cyp2c70−/−
  mice. (A) Fecal BA excretion in Cyp2c70−/− mice and WT littermates on control diet
  and after 3 weeks of colesevelam treatment. (B) BA composition in gallbladder bile
  of Cyp2c70−/− mice and WT littermates on control diet and after 3 weeks of colesevelam
  treatment. (C) Hydrophobicity index of biliary bile acids. (D) Plasma bile acid
  composition in Cyp2c70−/− mice and WT littermates on control diet and after 3 weeks
  of colesevelam treatment. (E) Total plasma BA concentrations. (F) Plasma ratio 12α-/non-12α-hydroxylated
  BAs in Cyp2c70−/− mice and WT littermates on control diet and after 3 weeks of colesevelam
  treatment. (G) Hepatic mRNA levels of genes involved in the BA synthesis pathway
  in Cyp2c70−/− mice and WT littermates on control diet and after 3 weeks of colesevelam
  treatment. (H) mRNA levels of genes involved in BA signaling in the terminal ileum
  of Cyp2c70−/− mice and WT littermates on control diet and after 3 weeks of colesevelam
  treatment. N = 8−9 mice/group. Data are presented as Tukey’s box and whisker plots
  or pie charts, and p values represent * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001
  from Kruskal−Wallis H testing followed by Conover post comparisons. WT: wild type;
  KO: Cyp2c70−/−, WTD: western−type diet; CA: cholic acid; CDCA: chenodeoxycholic
  acid; Cyp7a1: cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase; Cyp8b1: sterol 12α-hydroxylase; Fxr: farnesoid
  X receptor; Shp: short heterodimer partner; Fgf15: fibroblast growth factor 15.'
