caption: 'Exendin-4 enhanced the transcriptional activity of hSR-BI/CLA-1 via AMPK
  signaling pathway in HUVECs. (A) The promoter activity of hSR-BI/CLA-1 induced by
  varying doses of exendin-4 (0~100 nM) for 24 h. (B) The promoter activity of hSR-BI/CLA-1
  in HUVECs with the treatment of exendin-4 or exendin9-39 for 24 h. (C) The effect
  of LY294002, STO-609, PD98059 or Compound C on the promoter activity of hSR-BI/CLA-1
  induced by exendin-4. (D) The effect of dominant–negative AMPK catalytic α1 subunit
  on the promoter activity of hSR-BI/CLA-1 induced by exendin-4. * p < 0.05 compared
  with control; # p < 0.05 compared with exendin-4.'
