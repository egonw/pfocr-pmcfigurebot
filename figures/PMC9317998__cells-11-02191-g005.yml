caption: 'MEKK3 signaling pathway is activated via PIEZO1-mediated CaMKII activation.
  (A,B) MBMECs were treated with KN−93 (10 μM, 2 h) and Yoda1 as indicated. Cell lysates
  were probed with the indicated antibodies. (C) HEK293T cells were transfected with
  the indicated plasmids and lysed for co-immunoprecipitation assay using an anti−HA
  antibody, followed by western blotting using the indicated antibodies. (D) Representative
  immunofluorescence staining with anti−HA antibody (red) and anti−FLAG (green) antibody
  in MBMECs transfected with the indicated plasmids. Scale bars, 50 μm. (E,F) MBMECs
  were transfected with the indicated plasmids. Cells were treated with Yoda1 (5 μM)
  or DMSO (F) for the indicated times 48 h after transfection. PLA was used to detect
  the interaction between FLAG−MEKK3 and HA−CaMKIIγ in MBMECs. Relative PLA signal
  intensity of cells in each group was calculated by ImageJ and shown in right panel
  of F. PLA signal: red, DAPI: blue. Scale bars, 50 μm. (G) HEK293T cells were transfected
  with the indicated plasmids, and cell lysates were probed with the indicated antibodies.
  The immunoblot was measured using ImageJ to determine the relative intensities of
  the indicated bands, which were normalized using the internal loading control proteins.
  The relative intensities are shown as numbers.'
