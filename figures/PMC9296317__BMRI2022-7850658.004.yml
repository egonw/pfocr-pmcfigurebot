caption: SLC6A14 depletion mediates amino acid starvation to alleviate the activation
  of the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 pathway. (a) MKN28-M cells were transfected withLV-pTZU-SLC6A14
  plasmid (MOI = 60); 48 h later, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in SLC6A14-silenced-MKN28-M,
  compared to MKN28-M cells, were identified using mRNA microarray analysis and were
  shown in heat map. (b) KEGG pathway analysis was carried out to clarify the top
  10 overrepresented canonical pathways that were enriched by these DEGs in MKN28-M
  cells following LV-pTZU-SLC6A14 transfection. (c–f) Indicated cells were treated
  with α-MT (5 mM), LV-pTZU-SLC6A14 (MOI = 60), or LV-pcDNA3.1-SLC6A14 (MOI = 60)
  plasmid for 48 h. Western blot analysis was conducted to detect the expression of
  signaling proteins in the PI3K/AKT pathway in (c) MGC-803, (d) BGC-823, (e) SGC7901-M,
  and (f) MKN28-M cells, respectively. (g–j) Indicated cells were treated in accordance
  with the methods as described in (c–f); the expression of mLST8, total, and phospho-Raptor,
  phospho-PRAS40, phospho-p70S6K, and phospho-4EBP1 was determined by Western blot
  analysis. For (c–j), the experiments were repeated for three times, and representative
  results were described as the representatives (upper panels) and the means ± SD
  of relative expression (bottom panels). ∗P < 0.05,  ∗∗P < 0.01, and#P > 0.05. (k,
  l) GC cells were stimulated with α-MT (5 mM), LV-pTZU-SLC6A14 (MOI = 60), or LV-pcDNA3.1-SLC6A14
  (MOI = 60) plasmid for 48 h. (k) ASNS and (l) CHOP mRNA were examined by Quantitative
  Real-time PCR assay. Data were displayed as the relative expression that were normalized
  to HPRT1 with the means ± SD from three irrelevant experiments. ∗∗P < 0.01.
