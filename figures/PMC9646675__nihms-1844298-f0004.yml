figure_title: Uncouplers and FAs bind within AAC
caption: 'a, Binding poses of deprotonated DNP in the cavity of the AAC1 c-state obtained
  from docking (solid) and a 500 ns molecular dynamics simulation (transparent) viewed
  from the membrane with TM1 hidden. AAC1 (cyan) is represented as ribbons, and DNP
  as sticks (carbon (yellow), oxygen (red) and nitrogen (blue)). b, Expanded view
  of DNP poses in a. c, Superposition of predicted binding poses for protonated and
  deprotonated forms of DNP, FCCP, BAM15 and SF6847. d, Arachidonic acid from a molecular
  dynamics simulation showing the carboxylate headgroup occupying the central cavity
  and aliphatic tail extending into the bilayer between TM5 and TM6. e, Hypothetical
  H3O+ (blue spheres) pathway from the intermembrane space (c) to the matrix (m).
  Pink spheres are titratable groups of docked uncouplers shown in c set to z = 0.
  f, Electrostatic energy profile computed along pathway in e using Poisson–Boltzmann
  continuum electrostatics. The grey region indicates high electrostatic barrier due
  to lack of solvation in the protein interior. The profiles correspond to applied
  voltages of 0 mV (blue), −80 mV (red) and −160 mV (yellow). Inset: magnified view
  of the profile near protonatable groups at z = 0. g, Cartoon model of the three-state
  H+ transport cycle: (1) the uncoupler (pink) bound to c-state of AAC1 (light blue);
  (2) cytoplasmic H+ (blue sphere) binds to the uncoupler; and (3) H+ transitions
  to the matrix pathway. H+ exits AAC1 to the matrix as the cycle resets back to state
  1. Each step is reversible, but only H+ movement from the cytosol to matrix is shown
  because it is favoured under negative matrix voltages. h, The steady state single-transporter
  current–voltage relationship predicted from the model in g using the values in  for
  a DNP-like uncoupler with cytosolic pH = 7 and matrix pH = 7.5. Model equations
  are provided in .'
