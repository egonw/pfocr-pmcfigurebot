caption: RNA-seq analyses of the mouse primary intestinal epithelial cells with different
  treatments. (A) PCA for the 12 samples; (B) Correlation heatmap of the samples in
  the control, LPS and LF-LPS groups; (C) Heatmap showing the expression of representative
  genes in the four groups; (D) Heatmap visualizing the activities of hallmark gene
  sets among the four groups; (E) Differential activities of hallmark gene sets in
  the LF-LPS versus LPS groups; (F) Difference in the activities of PI3K AKT mTOR
  signaling scored per sample by GSVA. (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, ns
  = no significant difference).
