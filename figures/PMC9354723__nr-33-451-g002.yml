caption: 'NGR1 administration attenuates tissue damage and motor neurons loss after
  SCI. (a) The representative image of HE staining in the Sham + vehicle, Sham + NGR1,
  SCI + vehicle, and SCI+NGR1 groups at 21 days after SCI. Bars = 500 μm (200×). (b)
  Quantitative analysis of the proportion of preserved tissue in each group. N = 6.
  Data are represented as mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05 vs. the Sham + vehicle group; #P <
  0.05 vs. the SCI+NGR1 group. (c) The representative image of Nissl staining in the
  Sham + vehicle, Sham + NGR1, SCI + vehicle, and SCI + NGR1 groups at 14 days after
  SCI. Bars = 500 μm (200×). (d) Quantitative analysis of the number of surviving
  neurons in each group. N = 6. Data are represented as mean ± SEM. One-way analysis
  of ANOVA with Turkey’s post hoc tests was used. *P < 0.05 vs. the Sham + vehicle
  group; #P < 0.05 vs. the SCI+NGR1 group. ANOVA, analysis of variance; HE, hematoxylin-eosin;
  NGR1, notoginsenoside R1; SCI, spinal cord injury.'

  stress, neuronal apoptosis, and inflammation via activating the nuclear factor erythroid
  2 related factor 2/heme oxygenase-1 signaling pathway.
