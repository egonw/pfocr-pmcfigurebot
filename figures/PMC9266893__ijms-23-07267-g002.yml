caption: 'The 25-residue peptide hormone, hepcidin, produced by the liver, is the
  central regulator of systemic iron metabolism. When hepcidin is released into the
  circulation, it binds to the iron exporter, ferroportin, resulting in internalisation
  and degradation of ferroportin, thereby preventing the release of iron from duodenal
  enterocytes and macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system. Hepcidin expression
  is controlled by several factors: (i) the amount of available iron, represented
  by body iron stores (centre) and transferrin saturation [TSAT] (right); (ii) inflammation,
  essentially via the proinflammatory cytokine, Interleukin 6 [IL6] left); and (iii)
  the iron requirement for erythropoiesis (centre). Replete iron stores increase the
  amount of the cytokines BMP2 and 6 (bone morphogenic protein 2 and 6) which, together
  with the cofactor hemojuvelin (HJV), activates the BMP/SMAD signaling pathway, resulting
  in hepcidin induction. In inflammation-related functional iron deficiency, hepcidin
  expression is increased via the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. As a function of the
  functional iron deficiency, the kidney produces erythropoietin [EPO], which increases
  erythropoiesis. The erythroid precursor cells continue to produce erythroferron
  [ERFE], which inhibits the BMP/SMAP pathway, decreasing hepcidin expression. Abbreviations
  not defined above HFE, high iron; JAK Janus kinase; STAT, signal transducers and
  activators of transcription; SMAD, small-body-size mothers against decapentaplegic
  homolog 1; TFR2 transferrin receptor 2 [].'
