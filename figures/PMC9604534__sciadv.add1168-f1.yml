  G protein–dependent manner
caption: Phosphorylated (p) and total (t) forms of the indicated proteins were assessed
  by immunoblot. (A) THP-1 cells transduced with pSLIK empty vector control (EV),
  pSLIK-US28-3xF (US28), pSLIK-US28-R129A-3xF (R129A), or pSLIK-US28-ΔN-3xF (ΔN) were
  treated for 24 hours with vehicle (−DOX) or DOX (+DOX). (B) CD14+ cells were infected
  with WT or US28Δ (MOI = 1.0 TCID50 per cell) and sorted by FACS at 1 dpi for mCherry
  expression. Parallel mock-infected cultures were sorted for the total live cell
  population as a control. Cells were cultured under latent conditions and harvested
  7 dpi. IE1 is shown as a marker of lytic infection. (A and B) Representative blots
  shown; n = 3 biological replicates.
