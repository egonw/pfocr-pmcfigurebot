caption: Vitamin C selectively kills pancreatic cancer cells via GLUT1. (a) TCGA database
  analysis showed that GLUT1 expression was higher in PC tumor tissues than in normal
  tissues. (b) The Kaplan–Meier survival curves indicated a significant correlation
  between high GLUT1 expression and low overall survival of PC patients (P = 0.016).
  (c, d) The relative expression of GLUT1 mRNA and protein in H6C7 cells, MEFs, and
  different PC cell lines. (e) Cell viability was detected by CCK-8 assay after treatment
  with vitamin C and/or STF-31. (f) Cell viability was detected in GLUT1-downregulated
  PaTu8988 and BxPC3 cells treated with vitamin C or not (∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001).
