caption: Potential mechanism of FGF1 and EGF action in protecting MCF-7 cells against
  taltobulin. Both FGF1 and EGF, upon activation of their receptors (FGFR or EGFR),
  protect MCF-7 cells via the MEKs/ERKs pathway, and MEK1/2 inhibition by UO126 blocks
  this action. However, in the case of FGF1, alternatively, protection of MCF-7 cells
  against taltobulin can occur through activation of the AKT/mTOR pathway, which then
  reactivates ERKs.
