caption: 'MK-2206 inhibited the EMT process in UUO mice and TGF-β1-induced HK-2 cells.
  (A,B) Immunofluorescence staining of E-cadherin in renal tissue and HK-2 cells (scale
  bar: 50 μm). (C,D) Western blot analysis of E-cadherin and transcription factors
  (Snail and Twist). Protein levels were normalized with GADPH. * p < 0.05, ** p <
  0.01, *** p < 0.001. MU: UUO + MK-2206, MT: TGF-β1 + MK-2206.'
