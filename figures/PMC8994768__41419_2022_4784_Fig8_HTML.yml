caption: A Schematic representation of experimental design and timeline of SV and
  the Wnt/β-catenin signaling inhibitor XAV939 treatment. B APP mice (red triangular)
  displayed impaired spatial learning during the hidden-platform testing in the Morris
  water maze (MWM2) compared to WT (black circle), a deficit prevented by SV treatment
  (APPSV mice, green triangle) and totally abrogated in APP mice that received the
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling inhibitor XAV939 during the last month of SV treatment (APPSV/XAV939,
  yellow triangles). These deficits were not due to visual or motor disabilities as
  APPSV/XAV939 mice performed as well as the other groups in finding the visible platform
  (day 1). C During the probe trial, despite poorer performance in APP mice and clear
  improvement in APPSV mice, significance was not reached. However, SV benefits were
  completely lost in APPSV/XAV939 mice as shown here for the time spent in the target
  quadrant (C p < 0.05) and crossings over the previous location of the hidden platform
  (D not significant). E Representative images of DCX immunopositive dendrites (black
  arrows) in the DG molecular layer were divided into L1, L2, and L3 segments. F Quantitative
  analysis showed that SV increased dendritic length in L1 and L2 segments, benefits
  lost in APPSV mice that received the Wnt signaling inhibitor XAV939 during the last
  month of SV treatment. *APP and SV/XAV939-treated APP mice compared to WT; APPSV/XAV939
  mice compared to APPSV mice; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01 using one-way ANOVA and repeated
  measures ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post-hoc test. Scale Bar = 50 µm.
