caption: 'MDA-MB-231-derived EVs carrying miR-887-3p targeted BTBD7 and activated
  Notch1/Hes1 signaling pathway to promote BC cell drug resistance. MCF-7, HCC1937,
  and BT474 cells were treated with EVs and transfected with oe-BTBD7. (a) RT-qPCR
  was performed to determine BTBD7 mRNA expression. CCK-8 assay (b), colony formation
  assay (c), and flow cytometry (d) were performed to determine the effects of BTBD7
  on BC cell drug resistance. Western blot analysis (e) was performed to determine
  Notch1 and Hes1 protein level in MCF-7, BT474, and HCC1937 cells under MDA-MB-231-derived
  EV treatments. Data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. One-way ANOVA
  and Tukey''s multiple comparison test were used. ∗p < 0.05 and∗∗p < 0.01. Three
  independent experiments were performed. BC: breast cancer; miR: microRNA; BTBD7:
  BTB domain containing 7; CCK-8: cell counting kit-8; RT-qPCR: reverse transcription
  quantitative polymerase chain reaction; ANOVA: analysis of variance.'
