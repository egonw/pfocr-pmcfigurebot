caption: '(A and B) Immunoblot for LC3 in response to lysosomal inhibitors (PI) (A)
  and quantification of LC3-II intensity normalized to actin (B) in sgPrkci and sgC
  MODE-K cells in presence or absence of serum (n = 3).(C) Calculated net LC3 flux
  and speed of autophagosome formation from cells treated as in (A) (n = 3).(D) Electron
  microscopy (EM) images of sgPrkci and sgC MODE-K cells in serum-supplemented media
  (Serum) or Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS). Arrows indicate autophagy-related
  compartments. Insets show at higher magnification examples of autophagic vacuoles
  and amphisomes in different stages of maturation. In sgC cells: a (autophagosome),
  b-f (inmature autolysosomes), g-j (autolysosomes), k,l (multivesicular body), m-o
  (amphisomes). In sgPrkci cells: a (autophagosome), b,c (inmature autolysosomes),
  d-i (autolyssoomes), j-l (amphisomes). Scale bar, 1 μm.(E-G) Quantification of the
  average number of autophagosomes (APG), autolysosomes (AUT), autophagic vacuoles
  (AV), amphisomes (AMPH), multivesicular bodies (MVB). At least 14 different fields
  were quantified.(H and I) Immunoblot for LC3 in response to lysosomal inhibitors
  (PI) (H) and quantification of LC3-II intensity normalized to actin (I) in sgPrkci
  and sgC MODE-K cells, transduced with the indicated siRNAs (n = 3).(J) Calculated
  speed of autophagosome formation from cells treated as in (H) (n = 3).(K and L)
  Immunoblot for LC3 in response to lysosomal inhibitors (K) and quantification of
  LC3-II intensity normalized to actin (L) in WT and S150A MODE-K cells (n = 3), (M)
  Calculated speed of autophagosome formation from cells treated as in (K) (n = 3).(N)
  qRT-PCR analysis of mRNA levels of IfnB in sgPrkci and sgC MODE-K cells, transduced
  with the indicated siRNAs and transfected with dsDNA or mock transfected for 6 h
  (n = 3).(O) Immunoblot analysis of indicated proteins in sgPrkci and sgC MODE-K
  cells transduced with the indicated siRNAs and transfected with dsDNA or mock transfected
  for 6 h (n = 3).(P) qRT-PCR analysis of mRNA levels of IfnB in sgPrkci and sgC MODE-K
  cells, transduced with the indicated siRNAs and transfected with dsDNA or mock transfected
  for 6 h (n = 3).(Q) Immunoblot analysis of indicated proteins in sgPrkci and sgC
  MODE-K cells transduced with the indicated siRNAs.(R) Scheme shows that increased
  autophagy in PKCλ/ι-deficient cells prevents the inactivation of the IFN pathway
  by CMA-driven degradation of STING.Results are shown as mean ± SEM *p < 0.05, **p
  < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. ****p < 0.0001. See also .'
