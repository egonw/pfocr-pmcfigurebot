figure_title: Rab40c regulates Hippo signaling in MDA-MB-231 cells
caption: (A, B, C) Control and Rab40c-KO MDA-MB-231 cells were plated on collagen-coated
  coverslips. Cells were then fixed and stained with anti-TAZ antibody (green) and
  DAPI (blue). Panel (C) shows quantification of nuclear TAZ fluorescence intensity.
  Data shown are the means and SDs derived from three independent experiments. (D)
  Quantification of nuclear TAZ fluorescence intensity in control, Rab40c-KO, Rab40b-KO,
  Rab40c-KO, and Rab40-TKO cells stained as described in (A). (E) Quantification of
  nuclear TAZ fluorescence intensity in MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with ANKRD28
  siRNA or non-targeting control (left panels). Quantification of nuclear TAZ fluorescence
  intensity in control or Rab40c-KO cells transfected with either non-targeting control
  siRNA or Rab40c ANKRD28 siRNA (right panels). (F) qRT-PCR analysis of CTGF and CYR61
  mRNAs (known Hippo pathway targets) in control and Rab40c-KO MDA-MB-231 cells. (G)
  Proposed model for Rab40c function in regulation FAs dynamics. The PP6 complex containing
  ANKRD28 and PP6R1 dephosphorylates FAK-S910 and/or pMOB1-T35 to regulate FAs dynamics.
  When Rab40c binds to PP6 through ANKRD28 and PP6R1, it leads to ANKRD28 ubiquitylation
  and subsequent degradation which results in PP6 disassembly and inactivation.
