caption: Effects of BANCs on the gene expression levels of NRF2 and autophagy signaling
  pathways in UV-treated D. melanogaster. (A) Autophagy signaling pathway genes and
  (B) NRF2 signaling pathway genes. CTRL-0 is the control group, CTRL-30 is the UV-treated
  group, and 5.0–30 is the UV-treated group administered BANCs, and the relative gene
  expression levels were normalized to the Rp49 level. Data from triplicate experiments
  are expressed as the means±SEMs (n = 3), and *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001,
  and ****p < 0.0001 indicate significant differences.
