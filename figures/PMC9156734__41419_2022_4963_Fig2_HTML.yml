figure_title: The PI3K/AKT signalling pathway in CECs
caption: Damage to CECs, WIN, and CAP can increase the Ca2+ concentration in the cytosol,
  respectively, which induce ectodomain shedding of EGF (and/or HB-EGF) via activation
  of ADAM and/or MMPs in the plasma membrane and extracellular matrix. The growth
  factors, insulin, and NK-1 induce PI3K phosphorylation by binding to their receptors
  in the plasma membrane. Activated PI3K subsequently phosphorylates lipids on the
  cell membrane to form the second messenger PIP3, leading to the phosphorylation
  of AKT. Then, AKT mediates downstream responses by phosphorylating or inducing the
  formation of complexes composed of various downstream molecules, such as mTOR, ROS,
  and GSK3β. Specifically, mTOR is an important molecule downstream of AKT, and AKT
  activation indirectly activates mTORC1, promoting cell migration and proliferation,
  and inhibiting inflammation and apoptosis. AKT, an antiapoptotic factor, also inhibits
  cell apoptosis through eliminating excessive ROS in cytosol. However, produced by
  NADPH oxidase, a low or moderate level of ROS act as a second messenger of PI3K
  and inhibitor of Phosphatase and tensin homologue, both of which promote activation
  of AKT. Activated AKT also phosphorylates GSK3β and reduces its activity, thereby
  promoting cell migration and proliferation. All of the above effects promote the
  healing of the CE together. NOX, NADPH oxidase; INSR, Insulin receptor; IGFBP3,
