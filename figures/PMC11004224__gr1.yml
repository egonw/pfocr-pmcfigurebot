caption: Methodological strategyA. Initial cluster of genes associated with obesity
  and particulate matter in the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD). B. The
  genes underwent Overrepresentation Enrichment Analysis (ORA) on the WEB-based GEne
  SeT AnaLysis Toolkit (WebGestalt) platform using the 'KEGG pathway,' 'Wikipathway,'
  'Panther,' and 'Reactome' repositories. C. Selection of transcriptome database in
  the GEO Gene Expression Omnibus database for in silico analysis through cases and
  controls. D. Analysis of differential gene expression on the Morpheus Broad Institute
  platform. E. Estimation of Spearman correlation between transcription due to PM2.5
  exposure and high-fat diet (HFD) intake. F. Biological association through protein-protein
  interaction networks on the STRING platform. G. Causal inference with the mechanistic
  interaction of PM2.5 with HFD. H. Causal typology with the Rothman model. I. Analysis
  of biological pathway enrichment on the WebGestalt. J. Identification of gene expression
  type in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). K. Promoter analysis
  using the Eukaryotic Promoter Database (EPD) platforms. L. Analysis of transcriptional
  regulatory elements on the Multiple Expectation Maximization for Motif Elicitation
  (MEME suite), TomTom, JASPAR2022, EMBOSS CpGplot program, and UCSC Genome Browser
  platforms.
