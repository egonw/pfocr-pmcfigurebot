caption: 'Overexpression of ELL-associated factor 2 suppresses the activity of the
  signal transducer and activator of transcription 3/transforming growth factor-β1
  pathway to inhibit the invasion and migration of RKO cells. A: Overexpression of
  ELL-associated factor 2 (EAF2) inhibited the signal transducer and activator of
  transcription 3/transforming growth factor-β1 (STAT3/TGF-β1) pathway measured by
  western blot assay. And TGF-β1 recombinant protein abolished EAF2 overexpression-reduced
  the phosphorylation (Tyr705) of STAT3 protein; B: Invasion and migration abilities
  evaluated by transwelll assay; C: Migration ability analyzed by wound healing assay
  after 72 h; D: Migration and invasion abilities of RKO cells measured using ImageJ
  software. The data are shown as the mean ± SD. aP < 0.05, bP < 0.001. RKO-C: The
  group of RKO control cells; EAF2-OV: The group of RKO cells transfected with ELL-associated
  factor 2 overexpression vector; RKO + T: The group of RKO cells treated with 5 ng/mL
  transforming growth factor-β1 recombinant protein for 24 h; EAF2-OV + T: The group
  of RKO cells were transfected with EAF2-OV plasmid for 24 h and then cultured with
  5 ng/mL transforming growth factor-β1 recombinant protein for 24 h; p-STAT3: Phosphorylated-signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 3; TGF-β1: Transforming growth factor-β1;
  EAF2: ELL-associated factor 2; GAPDH: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.'
