caption: 'Effects of BANCs on the NRF2 signaling pathway and MDA content in DSS-treated
  normal female D. melanogaster. C, CA, D, and DA represent the blank control group,
  BANC control group, inflamed group, and BANC inflamed group, respectively. (a) Effects
  of BANCs on the expression levels of NRF2 signaling pathway genes. (b) Effects of
  BANCs on the MDA content. The mRNA expression levels of genes in the D. melanogaster
  guts were measured by RT–qPCR. The relative gene expression levels were normalized
  to Rp49. Data from triplicate repetitions are expressed as the means ± SEMs. Statistical
  significance: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001.'
