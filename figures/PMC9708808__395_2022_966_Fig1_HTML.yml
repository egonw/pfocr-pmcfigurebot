caption: Cardiomyocyte-specific human β3AR overexpression prevents cardiomyocyte hypertrophy
  upon catecholamine challenge via NO/cGMP pathway. A Genetic constructs for adeno-associated
  virus (AAV) vectors encoding hβ3AR and control EGFP. ITR, recognition site for AVV
  packaging; Cmr4, enhancer sequence; Prom cTnT, troponin T promoter sequence for
  cardiomyocyte-specific expression; ADRB3, human β3AR receptor cDNA sequence, EGFP
  enhanced green fluorescent protein sequence, IRES internal ribosome entry site,
  Luciferase, firefly luciferase sequence; pA, simian virus 40 polyadenylation signal.
  B Representative images of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM) transduced with
  control (AAV6-EGFP) or human β3AR adeno-associated virus (AAV6-hβ3AR) for 72 h and
  incubated for 24 h with isoproterenol (10 μM), L-NAME (100 μM) or both. Nucleus
  is stained in blue with DAPI and α-actin is stained in green to differentiate myocytes
  from other cells. Scale bar, 60 μm. C Size assessment of NVRM treated as above (40
  cells/condition in each preparation; 3 independent preparations). The isoproterenol-induced
  hypertrophic response is blunted in hβ3AR myocytes and NOS inhibition by L-NAME
  restores the hypertrophy. D Confocal microscopy images of E9.5 cTnT+/+;R26ADRB3tg/tg
  (control) and cTnTCre/+;R26ADRB3tg/tg (c-hβ3tg) embryos, showing cardiac expression
  of GFP in an E9.5 embryo. E Immunoblot showing GFP expression in cardiomyocytes
  isolated from adult c-hβ3tg mice. F Immunostaining analysis for GFP in cardiac tissue.
  Scale bar, 50 µm. G β3AR protein levels is increased in c-hβ3tg mice. β3AR density
  (Bmax) in fmol of [3H]-CGP12177 specifically bound/ mg protein in homogenates from
  c-hβ3tg (red, n = 3) and WT (black, n = 3) hearts. H Mice with cardiomyocyte-specific
  overexpression of human β3AR (c-hβ3tg, red) and littermate controls (WT, black)
  were subjected to transaortic constriction (TAC) surgery (to induce supravalvular
  AS) or sham surgery and were followed for 2 weeks. I Supravalvular AS was confirmed
  by echocardiography as an increase in the descendant aortic velocity blood flow.
  J ATP levels were increased in hearts from c-hβ3tg 2 weeks after supravalvular AS
  induction (n = 5/condition). K Cyclic GMP:AMP levels ratio was boosted in hearts
  from c-hβ3tg mice, thus suggesting an enhancing effect of human β3 overexpression
  in cardiomyocytes on NO/cGMP signaling (n = 5/condition). Data are means ± SEM.
  Mann–Whitney or Student’s t test for non-normally or normally distributed data,
  and Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001. NS, not significant
