caption: Receptors that signal through a JAK‐Direct pathway (A) hIL‐6R, (B) hIL‐4R,
  (C) hEPO‐R, (D) hGH‐R, (E) hIL‐7R and (F) hIL‐2R signal through a classical JAK‐STAT
  signalling pathway as well as an alternative pathway that is dependent on a JAK‐direct
  interaction between STAT proteins and JAKs. Graphs are not to scale
article_title: 'JAK/STAT: Why choose a classical or an alternative pathway when you
  can have both?.'
