caption: The suppressive effect of LBP on the LPS-induced activation of MAPK signaling
  pathway. Immunoblotting and intensity from the respective blots represent for the
  phosphorylated p38, phosphorylated JNK, and phosphorylated ERK. Cells were pretreated
  with or without LBP at doses of 100 or 300 μg/mL for 24 h, followed by the induction
  of 2 μg/mL LPS for 6 h. Results are expressed as means ± SEM. Letters in superscript
  indicate that the difference between groups was significant (P < 0.05).
