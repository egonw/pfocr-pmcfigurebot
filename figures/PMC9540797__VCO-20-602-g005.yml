caption: Six hybridomas produce anti‐CD40 antibodies that bind canine lymphocytes.
  Mouse anti‐canine CD40 antibodies attached to CD40 on canine PBMCs were detected
  as per Figure . One dog was used to test all clones with staining shown as percentage
  of CD40+ cells (A) and CD40 median fluorescence intensity (MFI) (B). Dual‐staining
  with CD19‐PE and BV421 confirmed B cells expressed CD40 (C). Selected supernatants
  tested on three dogs; staining shown as mean MFI ± SEM (D). PBMCs, peripheral blood
  mononuclear cells
