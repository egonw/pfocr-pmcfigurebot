caption: Bioelectrical signals can activate ion channels, some voltage-sensitive genes,
  or receptors on cell membranes to initiate the downstream signaling pathways, thus
  producing various biological responses. The influx of Na+ and Ca2+ leads to the
  formation of ion gradients along or against the direction of EF. This will eventually
  lead to cell polarization and cytoskeleton redistribution. EF stimulation also induces
  EGFR activation in a ligand-independent manner. This triggers the downstream MAPK
  system, which leads to MAPK/ERK activation, cytoskeleton reorganization, and directed
  migration. When NSCs halt cell proliferation and initiate cell differentiation,
  PI3K/AKT signaling has crosstalk with the Wnt/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway
  through GSK-3β, promoting the accumulation of β-catenin and ultimately determining
  the differentiation of cells into neurons. EF can affect the NMDAR ligand gate and
  then activate the NMDAR/Rac1/actin signaling pathway to regulate cell migration.
  EF-stimulated AChR regulates directional cell migration and promotes neurite extension
  through different downstream signaling pathways.
