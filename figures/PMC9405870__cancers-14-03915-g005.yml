caption: Overexpression of FAM107A inhibited PCa cell migration in vitro as well as
  invasion. (A,B) The migration ability of cells was assessed using a wound healing
  assay. The healing area of wounds was quantified by ImageJ software 24 h after wound
  formation. (C,D) Cell invasiveness was assessed using a Transwell invasion assay.
  The number of invaded PCa cells was quantified with ImageJ software. (E) Inhibition
  of EMT by overexpressed FAM107 was verified by Western blotting, and molecular weights
  are in kDa. (F) Immunofluorescence assays were performed to detect E-cad and Vimentin
  expression in cells at a magnification of 400×. Data are expressed as the mean ±
  SD of at least three experiments. *** for p < 0.001, and ** for p < 0.01.
