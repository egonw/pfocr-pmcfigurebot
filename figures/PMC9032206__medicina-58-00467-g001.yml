caption: A schematic overview of EMT-related changes in the cell morphology. In the
  course of EMT, cells lose their normal tight, adherent and gap junctions, retaining
  only minimal cellular connections. Correspondingly, the adhesion belt made of actin
  filaments is changed to loose actin stress fibers. Therefore, the activation of
  the EMT generates profound modulations in cell physiology, especially affecting
  cell–cell junctions, cytoskeletal arrangement, cell–cell interactions, and the composition
  of the extracellular matrix (ECM), as well as completely changing cell polarity
  []. MET—mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition, EMT—epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.
