caption: The catalytic triad H46, D84 and C163 of 3Cpro played essential roles in
  suppressing ISGs mRNA synthesis and GAS promoter activity of type II IFN signaling.
  A HeLa cells transfected with pXJ41, pXJ41-3C or individual mutants of pXJ41-3C
  were treated with 100 ​ng/mL human IFN-γ at 24 ​h after transfection. 5 h later,
  the hGBP1, hISG15, hISG56, hOAS and hPKR transcript levels were analyzed by real-time
  RT-PCR as described above. Data represent the means ​± ​the standard deviations
  (error bars) of three independent experiments, with each experiment in triplicate.
  B Expression of 3C or individual mutant protein was detected by Western blotting
  using antibody against HA. β-actin was used as a protein loading control. C HeLa
  cells transfected with 0.5 ​μg of pXJ41, pXJ41-3C or its individual mutants of pXJ41-3C
  and 0.5 ​μg of pGAS-Luc as well as 0.05 ​μg of pRL-TK. At 24 ​h after transfection,
  cells were treated with 100 ​ng/mL human IFN-γ. 16 h later, cells were lysed and
  reporter expressions were measured using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay kit
  as described above. Data represent the mean ​± ​the standard deviations (error bars)
  of three independent experiments. D Expression of 3C or individual mutant protein
  in HeLa cells transfected with indicated plasmid was detected by Western blotting
  using antibody against HA. β-actin was used as a protein loading control. ∗, P ​< ​0.05.
