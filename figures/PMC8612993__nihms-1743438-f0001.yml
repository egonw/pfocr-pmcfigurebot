figure_title: IL-36 signaling pathway protects B6 mouse corneas from PA infection
caption: WT, IL-36α−/−, IL-36γ−/−, and IL-36R−/− mouse corneas were gently scratched
  with a needle to create three 1mm epithelium incisions and inoculated with 1.0×104
  CFU PA. (A & B) Eyes were photographed (original magnification × 10) and clinically
  scored from 1 to 3 dpi. The 1–12 scale clinical scores were graded by an independent
  blinded observer. All mice were euthanized at 3 dpi. The corneas were excised and
  subjected to (C) bacterial plate counting presented in log scale and (D) Myeloperoxidase
  (MPO) determination. The data in (B-D) were presented as median of clinical score
  (median ± interquartile range), average of CFU or MPO units per cornea (mean ± SD)
  in dot plots. P values were analyzed with one-way ANOVA, followed by a Bonferroni
  test. N=5, *P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, ***P<0.001. The results were representative of
  three independent experiments.
