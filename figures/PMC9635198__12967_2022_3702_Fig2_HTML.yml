caption: 'Differentially expressed genes in innate immune cells, monocytes, dendritic
  cells, and NK cells A. UMAP plot of the three monocyte subsets: classical, non-classical,
  and intermediate monocytesB–D. Dot plot showing differential expression levels of
  genes in each monocyte subtype (B), NK cells (C) and mDCs (D). Displayed genes showed
  similar expression in control and post-treatment groups, but inverse expression
  patterns in the pre-treatment group. The color of the dots represents the expression
  levels of the gene, whereas dot size represents the percent of cells expressing
  the geneE. Activity score of positive regulation of lipopolysaccharide-mediated
  signaling pathway in mDCs. Enrichment of genes with GO term GO:0031666 was calculated
  using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. p ≤ 0.1 (•), p ≤ 0.05 (*), p ≤ 0.01 (**), p ≤ 0.001
  (***), p ≤ 0.0001 (****), p ≥ 0.05 (ns)'
