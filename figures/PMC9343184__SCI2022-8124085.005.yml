caption: 'Resveratrol promotes BMP9-induced bone formation by activating the AMPK/autophagy
  signaling pathway. (a) Cell lysates were collected after infection with Ad-GFP or
  Ad-BMP9 with or without resveratrol (50 μM) for 48 h. The protein levels of p-AMPK
  and t-AMPK were measured by WB analysis. (b) Autophagy was induced by adding 50 μM
  resveratrol to Ad-GFP or Ad-BMP9. The LC3, Beclin1, and p62 autophagy markers were
  assessed by WB analysis. (d, e) siAMPKα inhibited the ALP of BMP9 and BMP9+resveratrol-induced
  osteogenic differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells. After pretreatment of C3H10T1/2,
  cells with siAMPKα followed by osteogenic differentiation with BMP9 or BMP9+resveratrol
  for 7 d, ALP staining (c) and ALP activity assays (d) were performed to measure
  the osteogenic ability. (e, f) The SP-1 autophagy inhibitor suppressed the osteogenic
  differentiation in the BMP9 and BMP9+resveratrol groups. Cells were treated with
  the combination of SP-1 and Ad-BMP9 or Ad-BMP9+resveratrol for 7 d, and ALP staining
  (e) and ALP activity assays (f) were performed to measure the osteogenic induction
  in C3H10T1/2 cells. (g) WB analysis showed that pretreatment with siAMPKα decreased
  the AMPK level. C3H10T1/2 cells were transfected with siAMPKα 24 h prior to treatment
  with Ad-BMP9 or Ad-BMP9+resveratrol. After another 48 h, protein lysates were collected
  to measure AMPK levels by WB analysis. (h) WB analysis showed that autophagy was
  inhibited by SP-1. After treatment of C3H10T1/2 cells with SP-1 combined with Ad-BMP9
  or Ad-BMP9+resveratrol for 48 h, cell lysates were collected to measure the protein
  levels of LC3, Beclin1, and p62 by WB analysis. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P
  < 0.001 compared to the control group. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, and ###P < 0.001 compared
  with the BMP9 group. &P < 0.05, &&P < 0.01, and &&&P < 0.001 compared to the BMP9+resveratrol
  group.'
