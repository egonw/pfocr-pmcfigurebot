caption: KEGG pathway classification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) KEGG
  pathway analysis showed that DEGs were involved in different signaling pathways.
  (A) KEGG pathway analysis of the down-regulated DEGs of NM versus NN. (B) KEGG pathway
  analysis of the up-regulated DEGs of NM versus NN were associated with different
  biological processes, cell component and molecular functions. (C) KEGG pathway analysis
  of the down-regulated DEGs of DM versus NN were associated with different biological
  processes, cell component and molecular functions. (D) KEGG pathway analysis of
  the up-regulated DEGs of DM versus NN were associated with different biological
  processes, cell component and molecular functions. (E) KEGG pathway analysis of
  the down-regulated DEGs of DM versus NM were associated with different biological
  processes, cell component and molecular functions. (F) KEGG pathway analysis of
  the up-regulated DEGs of DM versus NM were associated with different biological
  processes, cell component and molecular functions.
