caption: 'Probable impacts of non-spike mutations in Omicron in the replication cycle
  (A) and immune evasion (B). Here, NSP, N protein, E protein, M protein, ORF denotes
  Non-Structural protein, nucleocapsid protein, Envelope protein, and Membrane protein.
  (A)Schematic representation of the role of NSPs, E protein, M protein, and N protein
  harboring significant mutations in the replicative pathway. Viral NSP1 inhibits
  host mRNA from translating, which can be interfered with by S135R mutation in Omicron
  (K141-,S142-, F143- mutations are present only in BA.4). NSP3 possesses some unique
  mutations (T24I, G489S, K38R) in the region involved in binding ss RNA and nucleocapsid.
  Viral polyproteins cleavage is conducted by NSP3 and NSP5(P132H). Also, NSP3(S1265-,
  L1266I, A1892T) along with NSP4(L264F, T327I) and NSP6 forming a subcomplex mediates
  Double Membrane Vesicle (DMV) formation, which is required for viral RNA replication.
  NSP6 (L105-, I189V) inhibits autophagosome formation. NSP13(R392C) is the RNA helicase
  has role in double stranded RNA unwinding. The proofreading mechanism is facilitated
  by NSP14 (I42V). Structural proteins such as E protein (T9I), N protein (P13L, E31-,
  R32-, S33-), M protein (D3G, D3N, Q19E, A63T) have a role in post-translational
  modification, nucleosome formation, and viral assembly respectively. (B)Schematic
  representation of possible effects of proteins of interest in distinctive immune
  evasion pathways. Cytokine storm is mediated by ORF3a (T223I), whereas ORF6(D61L),
  ORF7b (L11F), and ORF9b (P10S, E27-, N28-, A29-) are potent Interferon (IFN) antagonists.
  NSP1, NSP3, NSP6, N protein, and M protein also show some role in immune evasion
  through distinctive pathways. ‘*’ denotes mutations in these proteins may alter
  their corresponding functions. Abbreviation- RER: Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum, TLR3:
