caption: Effects of the FAT10 overexpression and PI3K/AKT inhibition on hypoxia-mediated
  H9C2 cell proliferation and apoptosis. Detection of FAT10 mRNA expression by using
  qRT-PCR in H9C2 cells transfected with (a) interference or (b) overexpression vectors.
  (c) Measurement of H9C2 cell viability by using CCK-8. (d) Determination of apoptotic
  H9C2 cells with the application of flow cytometry. Data are denoted to be mean ± SD,
  n = 3, ∗p < 0.05.
