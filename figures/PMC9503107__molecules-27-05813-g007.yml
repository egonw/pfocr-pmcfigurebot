caption: 'Effect of the CNP extract and resveratrol on the ability to bind the ARE
  promotor, inducing the expression of the downstream GPx1 antioxidant protein. HT22
  cells were pretreated with 50 μg/mL CNP extract or 5 μM resveratrol for 24 h. The
  capability for protein–DNA interactions was detected via chromatin immunoprecipitation
  (ChIP) assay. (a) The product from the ChIP was replicated via PCR. (b) The data
  are shown as relative to the Gpx1 expression level and normalized by input (internal
  control). Values are represented as the means ± SD (n = 3). Note: * p < 0.05, **
  p < 0.01 versus non-treated control.'
