caption: Gibbs free energy profiles at U = 0 and −0.70 V (Gibbs free energy of the
  PDE, the NH3* formation step) during electrochemical NH3synthesis via (a) distal
  pathway, and (b) alternating pathway. In (b), two pathways are shown; (ii-a) alternating
  pathway without NH2NH2* formation, and (ii-b) alternating pathway with NH2NH2* formation.
  The temperature was set to 298.15 K. The inset images show the optimized structures.
