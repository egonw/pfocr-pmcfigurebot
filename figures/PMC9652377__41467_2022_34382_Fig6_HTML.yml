caption: 'a, b Ligand-promoted Gs (V2R) or Go (μOR) and βarr2 recruitment to the membrane
  in the presence of V2R-WT or V2R-W2005.33A (a), and μOR-WT or μOR-W2305.34A (b).
  Gs and Go activation were detected by monitoring the dissociation between Gα and
  Gβγ by BRET whereas β-arrestin recruitment to the plasma membrane was assessed in
  cells transfected with rGFP-CAAX, WT, or mutant receptors, as indicated, and βarr2-RlucII.
  Data shown represent the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments and are represented
  as ΔBRET normalized to the maximal response of the WT receptor. The insets represent
  the maximal agonist-promoted responses for G protein activation (solid bars) and
  β-arrestin-2 recruitment checkered bars. Statistical significance was assessed using
  a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test: #p = 0.012, ##p < 0.0001.'
