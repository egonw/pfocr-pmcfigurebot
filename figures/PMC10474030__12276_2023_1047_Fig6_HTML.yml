figure_title: Thrap3 regulated autophagy through AMPK
caption: a RNA-seq was performed on samples from the livers of NCD-fed Thrap3 F/F
  and Thrap3 LKO mice. Volcano plot of the gene expression of Thrap3 LKO (log2-fold
  change) compared to that of Thrap3 F/F from RNA-seq analysis; b Gene ontology enrichment
  analysis of differentially expressed genes in Thrap3 LKO compared to Thrap3 F/F;
  c Genes related to the AMPK signaling pathway were identified in the livers of HFD-fed
  Thrap3 F/F and Thrap3 LKO mice by quantitative RT‒PCR (n = 5 per group). Relative
  values are normalized to Thrap3 F/F. Values represent means ± SEMs. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001 vs. F/F; d Western blot analysis of phospho-AMPK, AMPK, phospho-ACC
  and ACC levels in the livers of NCD- or HFD-fed mice; e Western blot analysis of
  phospho-ULK1, ULK1, phospho-AMPK, AMPK, phospho-ACC and ACC levels in primary hepatocytes
  from indicated mice with nontargeting siRNA (si non) or Ampk-targeting siRNA (si
  Ampk); f, g Primary hepatocytes were transfected with GFP-LC3 and nontargeting siRNA
  (si non) or Ampk-targeting siRNA (si Ampk). GFP-LC3 puncta were analyzed using confocal
  microscopy (n = 8 per group). Values represent means ± SEMs. *P < 0.05 vs. F/F si
  non. $$P < 0.01 vs. LKO si non; h Western blot analysis of phospho-ULK1, ULK1, phospho-AMPK,
  AMPK, and LC3 levels in primary hepatocytes from indicated mice incubated with vehicle
  or 10 μM Compound C for 24 h.
