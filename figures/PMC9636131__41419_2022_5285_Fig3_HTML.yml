figure_title: MACC1 promotes PC cell migration and invasion by upregulating FN1
caption: A Heatmap of the upregulated gene expression clusters in control (Ctrl) and
  MACC1-overexpressing (OE) SUIT-2 cells. B, C Quantitative real-time PCR validation
  of selected differentially regulated genes after overexpression of MACC1 in PANC-1
  and SUIT-2 cells. **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001. D Quantitative real-time
  PCR validation of selected differentially regulated genes after knockdown of MACC1
  in BxPC-3 cells. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ****p < 0.0001. E–G Western blot for FN1,
  PTGS2 and MMP10 after overexpression of MACC1 in PANC-1 and SUIT-2 cells or knockdown
  of MACC1 in BxPC-3 cells. H, I GO analyses (H) and KEGG pathway analyses (I) of
  the upregulated genes in MACC1 overexpressing cells. J, K MACC1 and FN1 mRNA levels
  in primary tumor tissues and matched adjacent normal tissues from 10 PC patients.
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ****p < 0.0001. L MACC1 and FN1 protein levels in primary
  tumor tissues and matched adjacent normal tissues from 10 PC patients. M Correlation
  between MACC1 and FN1 mRNA levels in PC tissues from the TCGA datasets. R, Pearson
  correlation coefficient. N–P Immunofluorescence staining was performed in PANC-1,
  SUIT-2 and BxPC-3 cells using an anti-FN1 antibody. Representative images of immunofluorescent
  staining in PANC-1 and SUIT-2 cells stably expressing empty vector (lv-ctrl) or
  MACC1 (lv-MACC1) or in BxPC-3 cells stably expressing shNT, shMACC1#1 or shMACC1#2.
  Data are representative of at least three independent experiments. Scale bars, 20
  μm. D–F, J, K, Data represent the mean ± SD. of three biologically independent experiments
  (two-tailed t test). G–I, L, Immunoblotting experiments were performed with the
  indicated antibodies. Data are representative of at least three independent experiments.
