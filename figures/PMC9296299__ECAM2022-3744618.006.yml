caption: PNS inhibits TGF-β1-induced EMT progression through transcription factors
  snail and TWIST1. The gene and protein of snail and TWIST1 were detected by qPCR
  and Western blotting, respectively (a)-(b). ∗P < 0.05. ∗∗P < 0.01. ∗∗∗P < 0.001
  vs. Control group. ＃P < 0.05. ＃＃P < 0.01. ＃＃＃P < 0.001 vs. TGF-β1 group. (c) Then
  select immunofluorescence technology to further detect the fluorescence expression
  level of transcription factor snail and TWIST1 (magnification, ×500).
