caption: Schematic diagram of metabolic pathway and expression histogram of metabolite
  synthase. (a) A schematic diagram showing membrane-localized PC (32:0) and LysoPC
  (16:0) and the enzyme mediating the conversion of compounds in the scent glands
  of muskrats. (b,c) Relative quantification results for PC (32:0) and LysoPC (16:0)
  in the scent glands detected by LC-MS/MS during the breeding and non-breeding seasons.
  (d,e) Relative expression of Pemt and Pla2g4b in the scent glands of muskrats during
  the breeding and non-breeding seasons. (f,g) The linear correlation and scatter
  diagrams of relative expression of Pemt and Pla2g4b and relative abundance of PC
  (32:0) and LysoPC (16:0) of the scent glands, respectively. Each dot means the relative
  mRNA levels and relative abundance of PC (32:0) and LysoPC (16:0) during the breeding
  season (n = 3) and the non-breeding season (n = 3). B, the breeding season; NB,
  the non-breeding season; Data represent the mean Â± SEM.; * statistically significant
  values (** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001).
