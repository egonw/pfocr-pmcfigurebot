caption: Molecular mechanisms of mitophagy in the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis.
  (1) PINK1/Parkin signaling pathway induces mitochondrial autophagy by regulating
  the activity of p62/SQSTM1 and LC3 proteins. (2) NIX protein, located on the outer
  membrane of mitochondria, induces mitochondrial autophagy by directly binding to
  LC3. (3) BNIP3 protein, as the HIF- Î± target gene, can synergistically induce mitochondrial
  autophagy with NIX protein. (4) FUNDC1 protein, located on the outer membrane of
  mitochondria, induces mitochondrial autophagy by dephosphorylation and binding to
  LC3.
