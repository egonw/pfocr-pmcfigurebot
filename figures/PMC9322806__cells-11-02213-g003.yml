caption: 'Increased oxidative phosphorylation in replicative senescent endothelial
  cells. Oxidative glucose metabolism and mitochondrial parameters were analyzed in
  HUVEC of passage 1 (P1, young) and passage 20–25 (P20–25, senescent). (A–D) Mito
  stress test: basal respiration (A), mitochondrial ATP production (B), maximal respiration
  (C), and spare capacity (D) as calculated from oxygen consumption rates (OCR) measured
  via Seahorse technology at baseline and after sequential addition of pharmacological
  agents (oligomycin, an inhibitor of ATP synthase; carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone
  (FCCP), a mitochondrial uncoupling agent; antimycin A, an inhibitor of the respiratory
  chain complex III) (n = 6 (P20–25), n = 8 (P1), * p < 0.05, unpaired Student’s t-test).
  (E) Tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) activity
  as calculated from the amount of 14CO2 released from [1-14C]-glucose. (F) TCA cycle
  activity as calculated from the amount of 14CO2 released from [6-14C]-glucose. (G)
  PPP flux depicted as ratio between 14CO2 released from [1-14C]-glucose and 14CO2
  released from [6-14C]-glucose. All radioactive values were normalized to the amount
  of proteins of equally treated samples. Data obtained for P20–25 are shown as percentage
  of P1 data (n = 6, * p < 0.05, one-sample t-test). (H) Mitochondrial mass depicted
  as relative median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of MitoTracker staining analyzed
  by flow cytometry (n = 5, * p < 0.05, unpaired Student’s t-test). (I) Mitochondrial
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) displayed as relative MFI of MitoSOX analyzed by flow
  cytometry and normalized to P1 control (n = 5, * p < 0.05, one-sample t-test). All
  data represent mean + SD.'
