caption: 'TBX1 overexpression downregulated C2C12 cell proliferation: (a) representative
  images of the EDU-positive cells (red) were captured in wild-type and TBX1 cells.
  Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue; scale bar = 100 µm) and (b) cell cycle
  was analyzed by flow cytometry. The green, yellow, and blue peaks represent the
  G1, S, and G2/M phases, respectively. Mean ± s.e.m., Student’s t-test, two-tailed,
  *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001. (A color version of this figure is available
  in the online journal.)'
