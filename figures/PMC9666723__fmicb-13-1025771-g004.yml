caption: GO functional and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs). DEGs GO functional and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis in paired
  comparison of Gm-Ss vs. Gm (A,D), Gm-Ba vs. Gm (B,E), and Gm-Ba-Ss vs. Gm-Ss (C,F).
  The abscissa GeneRatio represents the proportion of DEGs belonging to a GO term
  and KEGG pathways in all DEGs; The larger the bubble, the more DEGs; Color indicates
  P-value, representing the significance of enrichment. The darker the color, the
  more significantly enriched the GO term and KEGG pathways. The right color gradient
  indicates P-value.
