caption: a | Energy materials present additional modelling challenges. Machine learning
  (ML) could help in the representation of structurally complex structures, which
  can include disordering, dislocations and amorphous phases. b | Flexible models
  that scale efficiently with varied dataset sizes are in demand, and ML could help
  to develop robust predictive models. The yellow dots stand for the addition of unreliable
  datasets that could harm the prediction accuracy of the ML model. c | Synthesis
  route prediction remains to be solved for the design of a novel material. In the
  ternary phase diagram, the dots stand for the stable compounds in that corresponding
  phase space and the red dot for the targeted compound. Two possible synthesis pathways
  are compared for a single compound. The score obtained would reflect the complexity,
  cost and so on of one synthesis pathway. d | ML-aided phase degradation prediction
  could boost the development of materials with enhanced cyclability. The shaded region
  represents the rocksalt phase, which grows inside the layered phase. The arrow marks
  the growth direction. e | The use of ML models could help in optimizing energy generation
  and energy consumption. Automating the decision-making processes associated with
  dynamic power supplies using ML will make the power distribution more efficient.
  f | Energy policy is the manner in which an entity (for example, a government) addresses
  its energy issues, including conversion, distribution and utilization, where ML
  could be used to optimize the corresponding economy.
