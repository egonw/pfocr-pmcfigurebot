caption: Metformin provided better cell growth of mouse and human LECs. Cell viability
  assay showing the concentration-dependent effects of Metformin on growth/health
  of LECs (A) mLECs line, primary mLECs isolated from C57BL/6 male (B), or female
  (C), Emb-hLECs (D) and SRA-hLECs (E). Cultured mouse and human LECs were treated
  with different concentrations of Metformin as shown in figure and were processed
  for MTS assay to determine nontoxic concentration of Metformin and its effect on
  cell growth/health. The histograms represent the mean Â± S.D. from three independent
  experiments. Vehicle control vs. Metformin-treated; * p < 0.05; ** p< 0.001.
