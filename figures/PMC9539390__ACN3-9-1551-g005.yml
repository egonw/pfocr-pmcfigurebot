caption: Combo changes more metabolites than either phenylbutyrate (PB) or taurursodiol
  (TUDCA) alone. (A) Partial least squares‐discriminant analysis of normalized abundance
  data for all metabolites. (B) Bar graph showing the number of significantly different
  metabolites (p value <0.05) for each treatment compared with vehicle. (C) Venn diagram
  of metabolites significantly changed by each treatment (p value <0.05). (D) Heatmap
  of Z scores of all metabolites significantly changed by Combo. *Indicates targeted
  metabolites. (E and F) Small Molecule Pathway Database category and pathway analysis
  of Combo‐upregulated (E) and Combo‐downregulated (F) metabolites.
