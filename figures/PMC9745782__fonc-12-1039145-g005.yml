caption: Molecular characteristics of CD8+ T after treatment is associated with improved
  overall survival. (A) Pathway enrichment analysis of genes in scSTAR-C1 and scSTAR-C2,
  respectively. The bar plot showed the top 10 enriched GO pathways. Benjamini-Hochberg
  (BH) adjusted p value < 0.05. (B) The number of associations between all changed
  genes, pathways in which scSTAR-C1 or scSTAR -C2 was involved and better or worse
  overall survival in the 21 tumor types. (C) The percentage of prognosis results
  predicted by scSTAR-C2 and scSTAR-C3 in 21 cancer types. (D) Flow cytometry analysis
  of the frequency of CD279+CD8+ T cells (upper) and the quantification of CD44 protein
  level (below) for 5 paired samples, pre-gated on live/CD3+ T cells and live/CD3+/CD8+
  T cells.
