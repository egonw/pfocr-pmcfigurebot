figure_title: Fig. 6. Effects of miR-21/PARP-1 on the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway
caption: (A–C) Western blot analysis evaluated the expression of PI3K/AKT-signaling-pathway-related
  molecular proteins in 16HBE cells transfected with NC, miR-21 mimics, miR-21 inhibitor,
  PARP-1 plasmid, PARP-1 siRNA, miR-21 mimics + PARP-1 plasmid, or miR-21 inhibitor
  + PARP-1 siRNA after 48 h. The experiments were replicated three times and presented
  as mean ± SD. PARP-1, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1; 16HBE, Human bronchial epithelial
  cell; NC, normal control; miR-21, microRNA-21; siRNA, small interfering RNA; siPARP-1,
  PARP-1 siRNA. *p < 0.05 vs. NC group, **p < 0.01 vs. NC group, ***p < 0.001 vs.
  NC group, †p < 0.05 vs. miR21 or miR-21 inhibitor group, ††p < 0.01 vs. miR21 inhibitor
  group.

  of human bronchial epithelial cells by targeting poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1
  and activating PI3K/AKT signaling.
