caption: 'NDV infection triggers mitochondrial damage and mitophagy in DF-1 cells.
  A TEM findings. (panel a) DF-1 cells were mock-treated as a negative control. Cells
  were infected with NDV at an MOI of 1 for (panels b and c) 9 h, (panel d) 12 h,
  and (panels e and f) 15 h. Bars, 1 μm (panels a–f). B Confocal fluorescence microscopy.
  DF-1 cells transfected with Dsred-Mito-EGFP were either NDV-infected or mock-treated
  (negative control). Mitochondrial fluorescence was evaluated 24 h post-infection.
  NDV: Newcastle disease virus.'
