caption: CKB inhibited the p53 signaling pathway. A. GSEA software analysis found
  that CKB could affect the p53 signaling pathway; B. p53 expression in the human
  osteoblast immortalized cell line (hFOB 1.19) and OS cell line (U2-OS, MG-63, SAOS-2,
  and HOS) was assessed using western blotting. C. Western blotting was performed
  to detect the levels of p53, p21, Bax, MDM2, and Bcl-2 in U2-OS and HOS cells. *P
  < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
