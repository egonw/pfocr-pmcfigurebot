figure_title: HIF1A is necessary and sufficient for hypoxia-dependent upregulation
  of micropinocytosis
caption: a, Immunoblot analysis of indicated proteins in MIA PaCa-2-knockout cell
  lines treated with the prolyl-hydroxylase (PHD)-inhibitor FG-4592 (100 μM, 72 h).
  Vinculin is a loading control. FG-4592 is used to stabilize HIFs and confirm pathway
  disruption. b, Relative mRNA levels of HIF1A-target lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA)
  in the indicated MIA PaCa-2-knockout cells treated with FG-4592 (100 μM for 72 h)
  compared to controls. c,d, Representative images (c) and quantification (d) of TMR-dextran
  (red) uptake in the indicated MIA PaCa-2-knockout cell lines under normoxia (21%
  O) or hypoxia (0.5% O2). Nuclei in blue. Scale bar, 10 μm. In d, data are normalized
  to normoxic controls. e,f, Representative images (e) and quantification (f) of TMR-dextran
  (red) uptake in MIA PaCa-2 cells transduced with indicated constructs under indicated
  conditions. Scale bar, 10 μm. In f, data are normalized to normoxic vector controls.
  g, Representative images from indicated MIA PaCa-2 xenografts showing macropinosomes
  (red), CK8+ tumour cells (green) and hypoxic areas (purple). Nuclei in blue. Dashed
  lines highlight hypoxic (purple) and normoxic (white) areas. Scale bar, 50 μm. h,
  Quantification of macropinocytic uptake in indicated MIA PaCa-2 xenografts in hypoxic
  (CK8+/Pimo+, red) and non-hypoxic (CK8+/Pimo−, grey) tumour areas. Data are normalized
  to normoxic areas in sgControl tumours. b,d,f–h, Bars represent mean ± s.e.m. b,d,
  n = 3 independent biological replicates; at least 500 (d,f) or 300 (g,h) cells were
  quantified in each biological replicate (n = 3). Statistical significance for all
  experiments was determined by a two-tailed unpaired t-test.
