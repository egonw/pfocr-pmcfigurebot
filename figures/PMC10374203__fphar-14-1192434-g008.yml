caption: Biological functions. (A) Significantly enriched pathwways in the high-risk
  and low-risk groups. The extremum located on the left side idicates a psotive association
  between risk scores and pathway activity, and vice versa. (B) There is a significant
  difference in pathways between high-risk and low-risk groups. Blue bars represent
  a positive correlation between risk scores and pathway aactivity, while yellow bars
  indicate the opposite. (C) The correlation between riskscore and tumor important
  pathways, as well as cuproptosis/ferroptosis-related functions.
article_title: Cuproptosis/ferroptosis-related gene signature is correlated with immune
  infiltration and predict the prognosis for patients with breast cancer.
