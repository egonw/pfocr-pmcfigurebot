caption: Synergistic effect induced by inhibition of EZH2 and NF-κB in glioblastoma.
  a WT and p65 KO LN229 cells were treated with DMSO or EZH2 inhibitors, including
  EPZ-6438, GSK126, EPZ005687, GSK343, GSK503. Cell viability was measured at different
  time points after treatment using CCK8 assays. b The x-axis indicates the 450OD
  value formed by treated WT LN229 cells, and the y-axis shows the 450OD value by
  p65 KO LN229 cells treated with the same small molecule. c The EZH2 small molecule
  inhibitor EPZ-6438 sensitizes p65-KO LN229 and U251 cells detected by CCK8 assay.
  d~f Colony formation, cell cycle and apoptosis assay were performed in the sample
  groups. g LN229 and U251 cell lines were treated with increasing doses of EPZ-6438
  combined with CAPE for 24 hours, and proliferation was monitored by CCK8-kit. LOEWE
  scores and heatmaps were calculated by Combenefit. h LN229 and U251 cells were harvested
  from drug-therapeutic cells at the end of the treatment (24h), then immunoblotted
  as indicated. i Subcutaneously implanted mice were treated with EPZ-6438, CAPE or
  combination. Images of representative tumors for every group at day 28. j, k Changes
  of tumor volume(j) and tumor weight(k) treated with CAPE, EPZ-2438 or combination
  groups during day 28. l IHC staining using Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for Ki67
  and H3K27me3. Values are expressed as the means±SD from three experiments, and the
  asterisk indicates the statistical significance compared to the controls (*, p <
  0.05, **, p < 0.01, ***, p < 0.001, ****, p < 0.0001).
