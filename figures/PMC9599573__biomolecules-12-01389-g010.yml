caption: Exposure to 660 nm laser modulates β-catenin-mediated Wnt pathway. (a). Venn
  diagram of Wnt pathway gene set and DEGs depending on different treatment groups.
  (b). Quantification of WNT6 gene post different intervention. Intervention dosages
  are set as 0.5 and 1.0 J/cm2 (n = 3 per group). (c). Immunofluorescence staining
  of catenin protein (red) post treatment (n = 3 replicates per group). Nucleus was
  stained using DAPI dye. Intervention dosage is set as 1.0 J/cm2. (d). Western blot
  and quantitative measurement analysis of β-catenin and relative phosphorylation
  levels post intervention (n = 3 replicates per group). Data are presented as mean
  ± standard error. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s test, **, p
  < 0.01.
