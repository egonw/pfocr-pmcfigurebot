caption: Expression pattern of UvSTE50 during the infection process of U. virens.
  The expression level of UvSTE50 relative to β-TUBULIN gene at different infection
  stages on inoculated spikelets (0 to 30 days) were tested by RT-qPCR. Error bars
  represent SD. * represent significant differences compared with 0 dpi, as estimated
  by Duncan’s new multiple range test (p < 0.05).
