caption: mAIH-induced pLTF is regulated by time-of-day dependent shifts in basal adenosine
  levels and hypoxic episode duration (ie, evoked adenosine release). Spinal adenosine
  (red dots) fluctuates across the daily rest/active cycle, with low levels during
  the rest phase (yellow) and elevated levels in the active phase (gray background).
  In the top row, 3, 5 min episodes of moderate hypoxia (3 × 5 mAIH) evoke greater
  adenosine release from glia (signified by larger dotted arrows). In the rest phase
  (top row, left panel), 3 × 5 mAIH induces pLTF through a serotonin-dominant (Q pathway),
  adenosine constrained mechanism. In the active phase (top row, right panel), greater
  basal adenosine levels near phrenic motor neurons coupled with still high hypoxia-evoked
  adenosine release cause a mechanistic flip; 3 × 5 mAIH now induces pLTF through
  an andenosine-dominant (S pathway), serotonin constrained mechanism. In the bottom
  row, 15, 1 min episodes of moderate hypoxia (15 × 1 mAIH) evoke minimal adenosine
  release (signified by smaller arrow from glia). In the rest phase (bottom row, left
  panel), 15 × 1 mAIH elicits pLTF through the full-blown serotonin-dependent Q pathway,
  with minimal adenosine constraint. However, in the active phase (bottom row, right
  panel), 15 × 1 mAIH still elicits pLTF through the Q pathway, but is now undermined
  considerably by elevated basal adenosine levels; in this case, 15 × 1 mAIH does
  not reach the threshold adenosine level necessary to flip pLTF from the Q to the
  S pathway, yet the Q pathway is sufficiently undermined to be lower than S-pathway
  driven 3 × 5 mAIH-induced pLTF at this time.
