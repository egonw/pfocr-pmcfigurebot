caption: The NF-κB signaling pathway was activated in corneas from the murine fungal
  keratitis model. (A–D) Western blotting results revealed the levels of TRAF6, p-IκB/IκB,
  and p-p65/p65 protein in the mouse corneas 5 days after infection. (E) Immunofluorescence
  was performed to detect the TRAF6 protein expression level in the FK group and the
  control group. The scale bar indicates 70 µm; n = 6; *P < 0.05.
