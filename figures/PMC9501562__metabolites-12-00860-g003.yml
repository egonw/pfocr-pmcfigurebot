caption: Overview of pathway analysis of human (a) neonatal and (b) maternal studies.
  The x-axis is the pathway impact value calculated based on topology analysis, while
  the y-axis indicates the significance level in enrichment analysis. Each circle
  in the figure represents a metabolic pathway. The circle size reflects the pathway
  impact value. And the blue circle indicates the pathway is significantly enriched
  (FDR < 0.05) and has relatively high impact value.
