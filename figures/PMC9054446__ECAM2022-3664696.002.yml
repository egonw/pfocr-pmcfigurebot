caption: 'ALR and PALR inhibited the proliferation of HMCs. (a) The morphology of
  ALR (10 mg/ml), PALR (0.1 mg/ml), and LPS-treated (100 μg/ml) HMCs for 24 h. The
  control group was added with 100 μl of DMEM, while other groups were each added
  with 100 μl of 100  μg/ml LPS. After 12 h of stimulation, the three drug groups
  were added with 100 μl of ALR, PALR, and MP, respectively, however, the control
  group and the LPS group were both added to 100 μl of DMEM, followed by 24 h of intervention.
  Images were taken using a microscope (200 × magnification). (b) The number of the
  HMCs counted using a Coulter Counter. All values are expressed in mean ± SD (n = 3;
  ##P < 0.01 versus control group; ∗∗P < 0.01 versus LPS group). (c) The inhibition
  rate of HMCs in each group. All values are expressed in mean ± SD (n = 6; ##P <
  0.01 versus control group; ∗∗P < 0.01 versus LPS group).'
