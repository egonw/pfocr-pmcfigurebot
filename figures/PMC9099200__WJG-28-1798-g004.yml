caption: 'The inhibition of Sirtuin1/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha
  signaling pathway increased hypoxia-induced reactive oxygen species production.
  A: Western blotting was performed to measure the levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor alpha (PPARα) in L02 cells; B: The levels of Sirtuin1 (Sirt1) and hypoxia
  inducible factor (HIF)-1α in L02 cells; C: Reactive oxygen species productions were
  detected by dihydroethidium (DHE) staining and evaluated by quantification of mean
  fluorescence intensity in DHE staining. Data shown are means ± standard deviations
  (SDs) of three separate experiments. aP < 0.05 vs Control group; bP < 0.05 vs Lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS)-treated group; cP < 0.05 vs LPS + Hypoxia-treated group; one-way analysis
  of variance with Bonferroni''s post hoc test; the error bars indicate the SDs.'
