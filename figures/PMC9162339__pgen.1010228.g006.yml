figure_title: GSK3 inhibitors and trimipramine rescue size defects in dNGLY1+/pl larvae
  upon proteasome inhibition
caption: Pretreatment with TWS119, LiCl, or trimipramine rescue proteasome inhibition-induced
  size reduction in dNGLY1+/pl larvae. A) Images of dNGLY1+/+ and dNGLY1+/pl treated
  with DMSO, bortezomib (BTZ) alone, or BTZ with drug. B) Quantification of dNGLY1+/pl
  larval size. dNGLY1+/pl were significantly smaller when treated with 5 μM BTZ compared
  to DMSO. There were no significant differences in dNGLY1+/pl larvae treated with
  DMSO compared to 5 μM BTZ+1 μM TWS119, 5 μM BTZ+1 mM LiCl, or 5 μM BTZ+25 μM trimipramine,
  indicating a strong rescue of the susceptibility to proteasome inhibition. BTZ =
  bortezomib, Trim = trimipramine. Dots represent individual larva and red bars are
  mean ± SEM. ****p < 0.0001.
article_title: An in vivo drug repurposing screen and transcriptional analyses reveals
  the serotonin pathway and GSK3 as major therapeutic targets for NGLY1 deficiency.
