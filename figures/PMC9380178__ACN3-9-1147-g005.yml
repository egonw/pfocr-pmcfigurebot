caption: One i.p. injection with 10 mg/kg GBZ reduces ATF4 transcriptome in WT and
  2b5 ho  mice. Four‐month‐old male WT (open symbols) and early symptomatic 2b5 ho  mice
  (closed symbols) received one i.p. injection of saline (placebo, black) or 10 mg/kg
  GBZ (blue). Mice were terminated 4 or 24 h after injection. Brains were taken out
  and sagittally cut. One half was lysed to obtain protein samples and total RNA samples
  as described.,  Western blot and qPCR were performed for indicated ISR markers (Akt
  was used as reference in qPCR). A simplified overview of the ISR pathway is shown;
  Ddit3/Chop, Trib3, and Gadd34 are part of the ATF4‐regulated transcriptome. GADD34
  is part of the negative feedback loop and dephosphorylates eIF2 when bound to protein
  phosphatase 1c. Graphs show individual and mean values, ±SD. qPCR and Western blot
  samples were derived from the same mouse. n = 2 animals per treatment group. Statistically
  significant differences between placebo‐treated WT and placebo‐treated 2b5 ho  mice
  are not indicated. Treatment effects on protein levels were statistically analyzed
  with an unpaired t‐test. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. [Colour figure can be viewed at
