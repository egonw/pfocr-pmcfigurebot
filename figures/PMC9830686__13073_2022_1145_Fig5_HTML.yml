caption: 'Immunofluorescence staining confirms the activation of MRTFB in mesangial
  cells during early DN. Immunofluorescence staining of the human kidney samples (ctrl:
  n = 2, DN: n = 5). Representative images showing the expression and localization
  of MRTFA and MRTFB in control and DN glomeruli. Glomerular endothelial cells were
  labeled by CD34, podocytes were labeled by NPHS1 (Nephrin), and nuclei were counterstained
  with HOECHST. Arrows indicate mesangial cells, which were negative for CD34 and
  NPHS1'
