caption: UDSCs suppress fibrosis in HK-2 cells via the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway.
  (A) The experimental design of an indirect co-culture assay. (B) In total, 10 ng/mL
  TGF- β1-treated HK-2 were co-cultured with normal UDSCs or si-Klotho UDSCs for 72
  h. The TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway was analyzed by Western blotting using HK-2
  cell lysates. (C) EMT-related proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using HK-2
  cell lysates. The results are shown as the mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001 vs. Control.
