caption: 'GXNI and DSS inhibited excessive release of inflammatory factors and leukocyte
  infiltration induced by I/R or OGD/R. (A) Representative images of immunohistofluorescence
  staining of mouse myocardium tissue in the sham, I/R, and GXNI (9 mL/kg) groups.
  The nuclei were stained in blue, while neutrophils were in green. (B) Quantification
  of neutrophil numbers in the sham, I/R and GXNI (9 mL/kg) groups. (C) The expression
  levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in the supernatant of myocardial tissue of mice
  in the sham, I/R and GXNI (9 mL/kg) groups. (D) The expression levels of IL-1β,
  IL-6 and TNF-α in the serum of mice in the sham, I/R and GXNI (9 mL/kg) groups.
  Values were expressed as mean ± SEM (n = 5). ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001 vs. Sham group,
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 vs. I/R group. Scale bar = 40 µm. (E) Quantitation of the
  expression levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in cell lysates of each group in in vitro
  experiments. Values were expressed as mean ± SD (n = 3). ###P < 0.001 vs. Ctrl group;
  **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 vs. OGD/R group.'
