figure_title: COMM exposure dysregulates bacillibactin and tryptophan biosynthetic
  pathways
caption: 'For all panels, asterisks indicate imputed log2-fold changes due to the
  non-detectability of the peptide under the compared conditions. This fold-change
  was imputed from a quantitative value of 1000, a value ~90% of the lowest value
  in the dataset (LLOD). a Patterns of protein abundance across the enzymes of the
  bacillibactin and tryptophan biosynthetic pathway. Heat maps display average (n = 3
  replicates) log2-fold abundance changes of individual proteins across the different
  treatment conditions relative to the control (left-to-right: COMM, U, Al, Mn, Fe,
  Co, Cu, Cd, Ni). Numbers in parentheses to the right of protein names indicate the
  specific log2-fold change of the protein in the COMM-exposed cultures. The heat
  map scale (displayed at log2-fold abundance changes relative to the control) is
  at the bottom of the image. Blue boxes indicate increased protein abundance (p < 0.05),
  red boxes indicate proteins that were significantly decreased in abundance (p < 0.05)
  and white boxes indicate no significant difference in abundance relative to the
  control. Pathway proteins lacking a heat map had no significant change in abundance
  patterns in any of the tested conditions. b Plots of intracellular concentrations
  of select bacillibactin/tryptophan biosynthetic pathway metabolites (n = 5 replicates).
  Center lines represent median values. Interquartile ranges and maximum/minimum values
  are represented by box ranges and whisker ranges, respectively. Mean values are
  indicated with an “x”. Internal points are marked with dots. * p < 0.01, ** p < 0.001.
  c Differential protein abundance patterns of putative bacillibactin transporters.
  Heat map details are the same as (a).'
