caption: Bidirectional molecular communication between bone and the brain. The bone-brain
  axis involves bidirectional communication between the brain and bone that utilizes
  several classes of signaling factors. Neural tissues produced several neurokines,
  including neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and neurohormones that signal down from
  the brain to bone cells. Several bone-derived osteokines also signal “upward” from
  the periphery to the brain through the circulation and bypass the blood brain barrier
  in homeostasis and disease to affect neural cell behavior and systemic metabolism.
