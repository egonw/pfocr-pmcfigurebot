caption: Mechanism of lncRNAs for regulating macrophage proliferation and differentiation.
  LncRNA Mirt2 promotes the M2 polarization of macrophages by inhibiting the Lys63
  (K63) ubiquitination of TRAF6. LncRNA NEAT1 increases the expression of TRAF6 and
  TAK1 by binding to miR-125a-5p, eventually leading to M1 polarization of macrophages.
  Overexpression of lncRNA IGHCγ1 promotes the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway
  by regulating miR-6891-3p/TLR4 axis, thereby aggravating the TLR4-mediated inflammatory
  response of macrophages. LncRNA HIX003209 promotes the expression of TLR4 and activation
  of NF-κB in macrophages by targeting miR-6089.
