caption: TLR via NF-κB to promote CRC progression. An important mediator of both acute
  and chronic inflammatory responses, TLR activation on cells stimulated by endogenous
  ligands activates the NF-κB signaling pathway, triggering the transcription of many
  pro-inflammatory genes. In addition to enhancing the proliferative capacity of mutant
  cells, this results in DNA damage, which increases mutation rates. In addition,
  inflammation caused by NF-kB contributes to an increase in the stemness of cancer
  cells that already have an elevated level of NF-kB expression. This, in turn, enhances
  the cancer cells’ stemness, which in turn increases the number of CSCs in the tumor,
  which in turn contributes to cancer metastasis, treatment resistance, and recurrence
  after treatment. CSCs, cancer stem cells; IRF3, IFN regulatory factor; NF-κB, nuclear
  factor-kappaB; TLR, Toll-like receptors; colorectal cancer; TNFα, tumor necrosis
  factor; TRIF, TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-β.
