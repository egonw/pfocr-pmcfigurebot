caption: 'KCNN4 was highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma stem cells: (A,C)
  The RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) expression data of 377 cases of human LIHC samples
  were downloaded from the TCGA database (http://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/ (accessed
  on 5 December 2019)), and we divided the sample into two groups with low-differentiated
  state and high-differentiated state according to the stemness index for the following
  analysis. As shown in the Volcano Plot (A), 2463 up-regulated genes and 2214 down-regulated
  genes were screened out of 32,191 genes. GO (B) and KEGG (C) pathway enrichment
  analysis for differential genes were visible. (D) The interaction network of genes
  in enriched pathways in the STRING database (https://string-db.org/ (accessed on
  2 October 2021)) was analyzed to search for known protein interactions. (E) Relative
  mRNA expression of KCNN4 in non-CSCs and CSCs enriched from tumorspheres. (F) Protein
  expression of KCNN4 in non-CSCs and CSCs enriched from tumorspheres. These data
  represent the mean ± SD from at least three independent experiments. Two-way Student’s
  t-test. **** p < 0.0001.'
