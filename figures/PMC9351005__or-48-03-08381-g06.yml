caption: 'Cx32 regulates the expansion of LCSCs by the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
  (A) Cx32-overexpressing HCCLM3 cells were exposed to SC-79 and the mRNA levels of
  stemness-associated genes were detected by quantitative PCR. (B and C) The protein
  levels of stemness-associated genes and PI3K/Akt pathway activity were assessed
  by western blotting. The proteins were normalized with β-actin. (D and E) The sphere-forming
  capacities were observed. Magnification, ×200. The bar graph shows the average number
  of spheres >100 µm in diameter. All error bars represent the mean ± SEM of three
  independent experiments; *P<0.05 vs. the EV group; and #P<0.05 vs. the OE group.
  Cx32, connexin 32; LCSCs, liver cancer stem cells; PI3K/Akt, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein
  kinase B; EV, empty vector; OE, overexpression; EpCAM, epithelial cell adhesion
  molecule; p-, phosphorylated.'
