caption: NUCB2/Nesfatin-1 induces upregulation of the SREBP2/HMGCR axis in breast
  cancer in vitro and in vivo. A Total cholesterol concentration was measured in NUCB2-silenced
  and scrambled BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 stable cell lines transiently transfected with
  either empty vector or pcDNA3.1–6 × HisG-HMGCR, and confirmed by Western blot. B,
  C RT-qPCR (B) and Western blot (C) were used to assess the mRNA and protein levels
  of HMGCR and SREBP2 in the two paired stable cell lines. D Western blot analysis
  of HMGCR in shNUCB2-BT-549 and shNUCB2-MDA-MB-231 stable cell lines treated with
  exogenous Nesfatin-1 (0, 400, and 1000 pg/mL) for 48 h. E Representative IHC images
  of metastatic cancer tissues in nude mice were used to detect NUCB2, HMGCR, and
  SREBP2 expression. F Xena website analysis predicted consistent expression of NUCB2
  and SREBP2. G Xena website analysis predicted consistent expression of NUCB2 and
  HMGCR. The statistical significance was verified using non-paired T-tests. *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. EV empty vector
