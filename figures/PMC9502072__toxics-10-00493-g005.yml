caption: OPLS−DA score plot and loading scatter plot (A,B) of negative and positive
  (C,D) modes based on the zebrafish larvae normalized data exposed to 30 µM As2O3
  in comparison to control larvae. (E) Differential expression of metabolites in As2O3-exposed
  larvae produced by hierarchical clustering of the most significantly upregulated
  (red) and downregulated (blue) metabolites obtained from in negative- and positive-ion
  modes compared to the control group based on the log2 fold change value. (F) Metabolic
  set enrichment analysis of lipid metabolites in 6 dpf zebrafish showed the biosynthesis
  of unsaturated fatty acids, arachidonic metabolism, and sphingolipid were dysregulated
  after embryonic exposure to As2O3. Color intensity (yellow–to–orange/red) represents
  increasing statistical significance, whereas circular diameter is related to pathway
  impact. The graph was obtained by plotting−log of p-values from pathway enrichment
  analysis on the y-axis and the pathway impact values derived from pathway topology
  analysis on the x-axis.
