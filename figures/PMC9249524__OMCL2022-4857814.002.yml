caption: miR-376a downregulation distinctly promoted OS cell proliferation and migration.
  (a) Cell apoptosis in Saos-2 and U2OS cell lines after treatment with the miR-376a
  inhibitor, detected by flow cytometry. (b) Cell migration in Saos-2 and U2OS cell
  lines after treatment with the miR-376a inhibitor, measured using the transwell
  assay. (c) Cell migration in Saos-2 and U2OS cell lines after treatment with the
  miR-376a inhibitor, measured using the scratch wound assay. (d) Cell proliferation
  in Saos-2 and U2OS cell lines after treatment with the miR-376a inhibitor, analyzed
  using the CCK-8 assay. (e) Saos-2 and U2OS cell cycles after treatment with the
  miR-376a inhibitor, detected by flow cytometry. State n = 3. ∗P < 0.05.
