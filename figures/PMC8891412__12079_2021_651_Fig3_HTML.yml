caption: Classification of EC based on hypoxia-related lncRNA. (a) The cumulative
  distribution function (CDF) plots show the cumulative distributive functions of
  the consensus matrix for k values (indicated by different colors) between 2 and
  9. b, c Relative change in area under CDF curve (b) and tracking plot (c) according
  to various k values. (d) The heatmaps show the consensus clustering matrix for hypoxia-related
  lncRNA in the EC dataset for k = 2. e Heatmap shows the association of clinic pathological
  features based on the two clusters. f The survival analysis of EC patients between
  cluster 1 and 2 in TCGA cohort
