caption: Concentrations of metabolites relating to H2S synthesis. Reactions leading
  to the formation of H2S metabolites are shown in the proximal part of the sulfur
  metabolic pathway; blue labelled metabolites were determined in this study. The
  color codes of enzymes depicted in this figure and  are matched with the color code
  of patient groups (grey, controls; red, CBS/CBSD; brown, CSE/CSED; green, SQOR/SQORD;
  yellow, EE; blue, SOX/SOXD; magenta, MoCD). SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine;
  MATI/III, methionine adenosyltransferase I/III; MATII, methionine adenosyltransferase
  II; MTR, methionine synthase; BHMT, betaine:homocysteine methyltransferase; SAHH,
  S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, CBS, cystathionine β-synthase; CSE, cystathionine
  γ-lyase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; MPST, mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase.
  (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader
  is referred to the Web version of this article.)
