caption: 'Aldehyde 13-13’s influence on the CAMKKβ–AMPK–autophagy pathway is negated
  following OR2H2 gene knockdown: (a) OR2H2 gene knockdown analysis in cells transfected
  with control (scrambled) and varying concentrations of OR2H2 siRNA; (b) Immunoblot
  results for phospho-CaMKK-ß, CaMKK-ß, and p-CaMKK-ß/CaMKK-ß ratio; (c) phospho-AMPK,
  AMPK, and p-AMPK/AMPK ratio; (d) LC3I, LC3II, and LC3II/LC3I ratio. Experiments
  were performed in triplicate. Ctrl, control (0.1% DMSO); Ald 13-13, aldehyde 13-13
  (500 µM). Data are shown as mean ± SD. Two-tailed unpaired t-test was used for multiple
  or two-group comparisons. **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001.'
