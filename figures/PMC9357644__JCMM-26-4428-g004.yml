caption: Effects of UB on RANKL‐activated IκB/NF‐κB signalling pathway. (A, B) RAW264.7
  cells were preincubated with UB for 4 h and then treated with 40 ng/ml RANKL at
  0, 15, 30 and 60 min relative to the non‐UB treatment (0 μM). Total protein was
  extracted and subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies against NF‐κB
  p‐p65, p65, IκB and β‐Actin. (C, D) The relative intensities of the protein bands
  were normalized to β‐Actin and analysed by image J software. (E) RAW264.7 cells
  were pretreated with UB for 2 h prior to RANKL (40 ng/ml) stimulation for 30 min.
  Then, whole cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were extracted and subjected to Western
  blot analysis using antibodies against NF‐κB p65. The levels of β‐Actin and Lamin
  B1 expression were measured to confirm equal protein amounts in cytoplasmic fractions
  and nuclear extracts. (F) RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with UB (100 μM) for 2 h
  and then stimulated with 40 ng/ml RANKL for 30 min. Immunofluorescence staining
  (Scale bar = 50 μm) was performed to locate NF‐κB p65 (red). Nuclear counter staining
  was performed using DAPI (blue). Data are expressed as the means ± standard deviation
  of three independent experiments; *, p < 0.05, **, p < 0.01 vs. RANKL+DMSO group
