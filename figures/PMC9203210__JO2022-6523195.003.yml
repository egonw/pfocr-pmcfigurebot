caption: 'The activation of CHRM1 positively regulates autophagy in prostate cancer
  cells. (a) TEM for PCa cell after adding different concentrations of CAR. Red arrows
  pointed to autophagosomes with materials to be digested (CTRL: 4000X; CAR:15000X).
  (b) Western blotting of protein expression of p62, LC3-II or GAPDH treated with
  2 μM carbachol or 200 μM pirenzepine for up to 24 h in the condition of serum-free
  medium or complete medium (CTRL) for up to 36 h. (c) Statistics of LC3-II/LC3-I
  ratio were obtained from Western blot results in . Data in C are means ± SD. ∗P
  < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01; and ∗∗∗P < 0.001. (d) Western blotting of protein expression
  of p62, LC3-II, or GAPDH incubated in medium lacking serum for 36 h after the addition
  of carbachol or pirenzepine compared to nonspecific drugs in PC-3 cells. (e) LC3
  puncta were analyzed by immunofluorescence after treatment with 2 μM carbachol for
  24 h under starvation conditions. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Scale bar: 10 μm.
  (f) PC-3 cells were transfected with Ad-mCherry-GFP-LC3B and cultured without serum
  for 24 h and treated with pirenzepine (200 μM) and carbachol (2 μM) for 18 h. A
  fluorescence microscope was used to determine the direction of autophagy flow by
  the expression of LC3-II. (g) Western blotting of the expression of CHRM1 after
  knocking down CHRM1 in PCa cell and the expression of LC3 in PC-3-sh-CHRM1 cell
  after adding CAR. (h) LC3 puncta were analyzed by immunofluorescence after knocking
  down CHRM1 in PC-3 for 24 h. DAPI was used to stain nuclei. sh-CHRM1: green fluorescence.
  Scale bar: 10 μm.'
