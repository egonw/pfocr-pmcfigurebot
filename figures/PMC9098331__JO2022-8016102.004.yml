caption: Effects of HOXC6 on the invasion and migration of GBM cells. (a, b) Images
  and bar graphs showing the migrative activity measured by the wound healing assay
  in control or HOXC6-deficient U87 and U251 cells. (c, d) The migrative activity
  of control or HOXC6-deficient U87 and U251 cells was also examined using the Transwell
  assay. (e, f) The invasive activity of control or HOXC6-deficient U87 and U251 cells
  was determined by the Transwell invasion experiment. ∗∗∗p < 0.01. Data are shown
  as means ± SD.
