caption: Knockdown of miR-19a-3p decreases the IC50 of Letrozole in breast cancer
  cells. (A) Cell healing rate at 0 hours and 72 hours was measured by scratch assay
  with the scale of 100 μm. The experiment was repeated 3 times.*P<0.05. (B) Transwell
  experiment was performed to detect the effect of knockdown miR-19a-3p on the mobility
  of breast cancer cells. The experiment was repeated for 3 times with 20× microscope
  field.**P<0.01 and ***P<0.001. (C) Cell clonal formation assay was performed to
  detect the effect of knockdown miR-19a-3p on breast cancer cell colony formation.
  The experiment was repeated for 3 times.***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001. (D) CCK-8 was
  used to detect cell activity, and each group had 3 repeated wells.**P<0.01. (E)
  Graphpad Prism calculated IC50 of MCF-7 and BT-474 cells against Letrozole. ****P<0.0001.
