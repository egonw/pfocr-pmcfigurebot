caption: 'Downregulation of cell cycle and immune response genes while developmental
  pathways genes are induced following long heat shockRelated to .(A) Illustration
  of long heat shock treatment.(B) Cells after LongHS stained with G3BP1 (green),
  actin filaments stained with phalloidin (red) and nuclei stained with DAPI (blue).
  Imaging was done using Nikon ECLIPSE TI-DH Florescent Microscope, scale bar = 10 μm.
  Turquoise nuclei marked with arrows contain the stress granules. No stress granules
  were found in LongNT.(C and D) (C) Results of Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
  Hallmark analysis showing significantly enriched gene sets (FDR q < 25% and p < 0.05).
  A positive normalized enrichment score value, in red, indicates enrichment in the
  LongHS phenotype (upregulated gene sets in LongHS). Negative enrichment, in blue,
  indicate enrichment in the LongNT phenotype (downregulated in LongHS). Upregulated
  heat stress genes and redox maintenance related genes are marked by red and green
  errors, respectively, while downregulated genes are pointed at by blue errors (D)
  Differentiation pathways significantly (padj < 0.05) upregulated in LongHS vs. LongNT
  as per g:Profiler GO analysis, and their associated genes are presented in GOChord
  plot. The plot’s left half shows the DEGs shared by at least 3 differentiation pathways
  and the right half displays the GO terms related to differentiation pathways marked
  in various colors. The colored bands connect a gene to a specific GO term. The scale
  bar presents gene’s log2FC.(E) KEGG pathways significantly enriched in upregulated
  DEGs of LongHS vs. LongNT presented by ClueGo pathway analysis and visualization.
  Colors represented p value: light red 0.05, red 0.01, brown 0.001. The node size
  represents the term enrichment significance.(F) Significantly enriched (FDR q < 25%
  and p < 0.05) upregulated GSEA GO terms related to histone modifications and PcG
  complex following LongHS.'
