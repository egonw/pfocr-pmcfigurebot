caption: SPM reduces DbCM myocardial damage by regulating lipid metabolism and amino
  acid metabolism pathways. (a) The heat map showed the DEGs related to lipid metabolism
  pathway in DbCM/CK and SPM/DbCM. (b) The heat map showed the DEGs related to amino
  acid metabolism pathway in DbCM/CK and SPM/DbCM. (c) The heat map showed the coexpressed
  genes related to metabolic pathway in the CK, DbCM, and SPM groups. Red color shows
  the genes with significantly elevated transcription levels, and green color shows
  the genes with significantly reduced transcription levels.
