caption: Baseline mTOR pathway expression and response to rapamycin and AA exposure
  in cerebral organoids. (A) Quantification of Western blots for the mTOR–phospho-mTOR
  (P-mTOR/mTOR) ratio and the P70S6K–phospho-P70S6K (P-P70S6K/P70S6K) ratio in CTR
  organoids at different time points (week 4, week 5, and week 15). (B) mTOR and P70S6K
  gene expression in CTR organoids showing differences in DESeq2 vst log-transformed
  raw counts at different time points (week 4, week 5, and week 15). (C,D) Quantification
  of Western blots for (C) P-P70S6K/P70S6k ratio in rapamycin-exposed organoids and
  (D) P-P70S6K/P70S6k ratio in acutely AA-exposed (10 mM/50 mM) organoids. (E) Western
  blots of acutely AA-exposed cerebral organoids lysates quantified in (E). Three
  samples per condition for 3 cell lines were used. Western blots were cropped to
  show the relevant bands (P70S6K, P-P70S6K, and GAPDH). Boxplots display median and
  IQR, with whiskers from minimum to maximum values. Data points represent individual
  organoids from different cell lines (circles = OH2.6; triangles = OH1.5; squares
  = OH4.6). Data were analyzed with the Kruskal–Wallis tests with Dunn test for multiple
  comparisons. Significant differences compared to W4 (for (A,B)) and to CTR (for
  (D)) are indicated with * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01, **** p < 0.001. Mann–Whitney test
  was used to compare rapamycin treatment to CTR condition (** p < 0.01).
