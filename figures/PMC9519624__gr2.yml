caption: 'RPRM inhibits DNA repair signaling pathway and enhances cellular radiosensitivity(A)
  Representative immunofluorescence images of γ-H2AX in H460-NC/RPRM cells after 2 Gy
  X-irradiation and quantification of the number of γ-H2AX foci per cell. At least
  200 nuclei were scored. Scale bars, 20 μm.(B) Immunofluorescence images of 53BP1
  foci after X-irradiated with 2 Gy and quantification. At least 200 nuclei were scored.
  Scale bar, 20 μm.(C) Immunofluorescence images of RAD51 foci after IR and quantification.
  Scale bars, 10 μm. At least 500 nuclei for each sample were scored in each experiment.(D)
  Comet assay on H460-NC/RPRM cells at different times after 2 Gy X-irradiation. The
  tail moments were quantified using CometScore. At least 500 cells were scored per
  sample. Scale bars, 50 μm.(E) RPRM overexpression decreased the colony formation
  ability of cancer cells. Sensitization enhancement ratio (SER) was calculated according
  to the following formula: The radiation dose required for the control group to obtain
  30% cell survival/the radiation dose required to obtain the same cell survival rate
  after overexpression of RPRM.(F) RPRM overexpression increased micronucleus formation
  in cancer cells upon 2 Gy X-irradiation.(G and H) RPRM knockdown significantly increased
  cellular radio-resistance manifesting as increased plating efficiency (G, 4 Gy)
  and decreased micronucleus formation (H, 2 Gy) in irradiated H460 cells.(I) RPRM
  knockout significantly reduced the micronucleus formation in MEFs upon 5 Gy X-irradiation.(J)
  Micronucleus formation of RPRM−/− MEFs transfected with NC and WT RPRM plasmids
  after exposed to 5 Gy X-irradiation.Data shown represent the means (±SEM) of three
  biological replicates, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001; significance was determined
  by unpaired two-sample t test.'
