caption: '(Aâ€“E) Box plots of the enriched pathways predicted by gene expression values
  on nSolver software analysis of the specific pathway down-regulated in the transfected
  cells with the miR-17-5p. (F) Bar chart reports the most relevant functional annotations
  obtained by DAVID Bioinformatics tool using down-modulated genes in miR-17-5p transfected
  cells versus NC. The list was sorted by log-false discovery rate (logFDR) values.
