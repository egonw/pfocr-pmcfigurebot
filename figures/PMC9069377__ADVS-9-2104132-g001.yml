caption: ERK5‐NR4A signaling pathway is involved in GPR54 regulated CD8+ T cell exhaustion.
  NR4A1 expression levels in the splenic CD8+ T cells with ionomycin (500 ng mL−1)
  were determined by FCM analysis A) (n = 6). B) CD8+ T cells were primed with ionomycin
  (500 ng mL−1) for 6 h, then pretreated with the indicated concentrations of 2‐APB
  for 1 h and stimulated with KP‐10 (50 × 10−6m) for 1 h, and then ERK5 phosphorylation
  was analyzed by immunoblotting. C) ERK5 and p‐ERK5 expression levels in splenic
  CD8+ T cells with ionomycin (500 ng mL−1) were determined by Western blot. Gpr54
  +/+ and Gpr54 −/− mice splenic CD8+ T cells treated with XMD8‐92 (5 × 10−6m) for
  6 h, then with PMA/ionomycin plus protein transport inhibitor for 4 h, TNFα +IFNγ
  + D) ratio detected by FCM (n = 6). E) Gpr54 +/+ and Gpr54 −/− mice implanted with
  106 LLC tumor cells by a subcutaneous injection, the tumor volumes reached 50–70
  mm3 and an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection with XMD8‐92 (50 mg kg−1, twice a day) was
  given, the LLC tumor picture and tumor growth curves and tumor sizes with XMD8‐92
  were represented (n = 4). FCM analysis of the proportions of F) tumor CD45+, G)
  CD8+, and H) LAG3+ CD8+ cell populations at end‐point (n = 4). I) PSMA‐CAR‐T cells
  were stained with 5 × 10−6m of cell proliferation dye eFluor 450, and the cell proliferation
  was detected 72 h later by flow cytometry. PC3‐PSMA cells were mixed with the wild‐type
  (WT), GPR54 −/−, or ERK5 −/− PSMA‐CAR‐T cells at the indicated effector‐to‐target
  (E:T) ratios, and J) cytotoxicity assay, K) cytokine release, and L–N) exhaustion
  are presented (n = 3–4). All data are from at least three independent experiments.
  Data are represented as the mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 by one‐way
  ANOVA followed by LSD analysis.
