caption: Coexpression analysis of MEX3C in cervical cancer tissues. (a) Sequence alignment
  between miR-136 and MEX3C (target scan database). (b) MEX3C coexpressed genes in
  TCGA cervical cancer tissues were investigated using the LinkedOmics database. The
  correlation of MEX3C with genes expressed in the cervical cancer cohort was studied
  using the Pearson test. Heat maps depicting genes in cervical cancer tissues that
  are positively (A) and negatively (B) linked to MEX3C. (c) GSEA revealed that elevated
  MEX3C expression was linked to CSC-related signaling pathways in cervical cancer
  tissues.
