caption: 'The Lss-sensitive miR-29b-3p/CX3CL1 axis alleviates inflammation through
  blocking the NF-κB signaling pathway in HAECs. HAECs were subjected to Lss for 12 h
  in the presence or absence of TNF-α (10 ng/ml). (A,B) VCAM-1, ICAM-1, phosphorylated
  (p)-p65, p65, p-IκBα, and IκBα protein expression were determined by western blotting.
  (C–E) The protein expression of p65 in the cytoplasm and nucleus of HAECs is shown.
  (F) The expression and localization of p65 in HAECs were determined by immunofluorescence.
  HAECs were transfected with pri-miR-29b-3p or sh-CX3CL1 in the presence or absence
  of TNF-α (10 ng/ml). (G,H) VCAM-1, ICAM-1, p-p65, p65, p-IκBα, and IκBα protein
  expression was determined by western blotting. (I–K) The protein expression of p65
  in the cytoplasm and nucleus of HAECs is shown. (L) The expression and localization
  of p65 in HAECs were determined by immunofluorescence. The results are presented
  as mean±s.e.m. of three independent experiments. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 (one-way
  ANOVA followed by a Tukey''s post-hoc test). Scale bars: 50 µm.'
