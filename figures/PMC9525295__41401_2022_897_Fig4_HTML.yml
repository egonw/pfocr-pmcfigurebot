figure_title: BAY-293 regulated Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS) signaling pathway
caption: a Western blot analysis of KRAS signaling pathway targets in PANC-1 cells
  treated from 1 h to 72 h with BAY-293 at 2.5 μmol/L. HSP90 was used as a loading
  control. b Western blot analyses of KRAS signaling pathway targets in PANC-1 cells
  treated for 24 h with BAY-293 over a 5-point dose response. HSP90 was used as a
  loading control. c Western blot analyses of KRAS signaling pathway targets in MIA
  PaCa-2 cells treated for 24 h with BAY-293 over a 4-point dose response. HSP90 was
  used as a loading control.
