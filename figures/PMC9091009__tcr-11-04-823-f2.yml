caption: Identification of immune-related DE-mRNAs in GBM. (A) Venn analysis of DE-mRNAs
  in TCGA database and immune-related genes in the ImmPort database. (B) Heatmap of
  common immune-related DE-mRNAs. (C) Network diagram of 369 immune-related DE-mRNAs
  and immune pathways. Red circle represents upregulated mRNAs, blue represents downregulated
  mRNAs, and yellow squares represent immune-related pathway. TCGA, The Cancer Genome
  Atlas; DEG, differentially expressed genes; GBM, glioblastoma; DE-mRNA, differentially
  expressed mRNA.
