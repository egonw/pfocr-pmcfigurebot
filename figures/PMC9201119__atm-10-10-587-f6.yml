caption: GE protects mitochondrial function in RPE cells under hyperglycemia via AKT/JAK2.
  (A) The CCK-8 assay was used to detect the changes in RPE cell activity after adding
  GE, AKT inhibitor, JAK2 inhibitor, and GE combined with AKT inhibitor and JAK2 inhibitor
  under hyperglycemia; (B) RT-PCR was used to detect the expression changes of CYT
  C1 in RPE cells after adding GE, AKT inhibitor, JAK2 inhibitor, and GE combined
  with AKT inhibitor and JAK2 inhibitor under hyperglycemia; (C) the results of Seahorse
  cell energy metabolism analysis; (D-G) energy metabolism analysis results showed
  the changes in the basal respiratory rate, maximal respiratory capacity, and ATP
  synthesis capacity after adding GE, AKT inhibitor, and GE combined with AKT inhibitor
  under hyperglycemia (***P<0.01, **P<0.05, *P<0.1). OD, optical density; GE, genipin;
  CCK-8, Cell Counting Kit-8; OCR, O2 consumption rate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate;
  RPE, retinal pigment epithelial; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain
  reaction.
article_title: Genipin protects against mitochondrial damage of the retinal pigment
  epithelium under hyperglycemia through the AKT pathway mediated by the miR-4429/JAK2
  signaling axis.
