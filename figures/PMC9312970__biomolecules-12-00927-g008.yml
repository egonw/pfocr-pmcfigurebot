caption: 'The relevant signaling pathway expression of pyroptosis of key proteins
  in AML12 cells after adding NLRP3 or GSDMD inhibitor treatment for 3 h as assessed
  by Western blotting and relative density analyses. (A) The protein level of NLRP3,
  Caspase-1, GSDMD, IL-1β, Nrf2, HO-1 and β-actin in each group after adding NLRP3
  inhibitor (MCC950). (B–G) Analysis of the protein expression by the ratio of NLRP3/β-actin,
  Cleaved-Caspase-1/Pro-Caspase-1, GSDMD-N/GSDMD, mIL-1β/β-actin, Nrf2/β-actin, HO-1/β-actin.
  (H) The protein level of GSDMD, IL-1β, Nrf2, HO-1 and β-actin in each group after
  adding GSDMD inhibitor (necrosulfonamide). (I–L) Analysis of the protein expression
  by the ratio of GSDMD-N/GSDMD, mIL-1β/β-actin, Nrf2/β-actin and HO-1/β-actin. Data
  are presented as mean ± standard (n = 3). NS means not significant, * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, ### p < 0.001. Where * represents comparison
  with the control group, and # represents comparison with the MH group.'
