caption: Overexpression of NCOA7 inhibits migration, invasion, and EMT of ccRCC cells
  in vitro. (A,B) Wound healing assays were performed to evaluate the migration of
  ccRCC cells (A) and the percentage of wound closure was calculated (B); scale bar
  100 μm. (C,D) Transwell assays showed the effect of NCOA7 overexpression on migration
  and the invasive abilities of ccRCC cells; scale bar 50 μm. (E) Representative fluorescence
  images of Vimentin and E-cadherin in 769-P and 786-O cells; scale bar 50 μm. (F)
  Western blot was used to detect changes in EMT-related proteins in 769-P and 786-O
  cells. N-cad, N-cadherin; E-cad, E-cadherin. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
