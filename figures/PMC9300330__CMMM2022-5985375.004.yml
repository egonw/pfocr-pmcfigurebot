caption: PF543 improved the viability of H9c2 cells and inhibited their apoptosis.
  (a, b) CCK8 assay results of H9c2 cells on H2O2 and PF543. (c) CCK8 assay results
  of H9c2 cells in four groups. (d, e) IF staining results of caspase3/9 in H9c2 cells
  (200x). (f) mRNA expression of caspase3/9, Bax, and Bcl2 in H9c2 cells. (“∗” means
  p < 0.05 vs. the control group; “#” means p < 0.05 vs. the H2O2 group), based on
  Student's t-test.
