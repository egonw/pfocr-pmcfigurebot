caption: In H9c2 cells induced by ISO, the expression of miR-194 decreases and the
  CnA/NFATc2 pathway is activated. (A) The effects of ISO on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy
  (surface area) were assessed by immunofluorescence staining (Ã—400). (B) The effects
  of ISO on the expression of ANP mRNA, a marker of cardiac hypertrophy in cardiomyocytes.
  (C) The effects of ISO on the expression of ANP protein expression. (D) The effects
  of ISO on the expression of miR-194. (E) The effects of ISO on the expression of
  CnA mRNA. (F-I) The effects of ISO on the expression of CnA protein and NFATc2 protein
  nuclear translocation. *, P<0.05 vs. control group. ISO, isoproterenol; miR, microRNA;
  CnA, calcineurin A; NFATc2, nuclear factor of activated T cells c2; ANP, atrial
  natriuretic peptide; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.
