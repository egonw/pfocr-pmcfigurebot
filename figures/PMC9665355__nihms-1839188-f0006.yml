figure_title: Syt11 is necessary to drive Impad1-mediated exocytosis, invasion, and
  metastasis in lung cancer
caption: (A) VSV-G assay confocal images of 393P Impad1-overexpressing cells co-transfected
  with EGFP-VSV-G and siControl or siSyt11. Green, total VSV-G; red, surface VSV-G.
  Scatterplots (right) show the ratio of surface to total VSV-G signal intensity/cell.
  n = 20; statistical outliers were removed. Each experiment had 3 technical replicates
  and 2 biological replicates. Scale bars, 10 μm.(B) mRNA and protein confirmation
  of siRNA-mediated knockdown of Syt11 in 344SQ Impad1-overexpressing cells.(C and
  D) Boyden chamber assay quantifying cell invasion upon siSyt11 in 344SQ vector or
  Impad1-overexpressing cells. Scale bars, 100 μm.(D) Boyden chamber assay quantifying
  invasion in 344SQ control or shSyt11 cells. Scale bars, 100 μm.(E) Secretome-mediated
  invasion assay quantifying invasiveness of 393P KP cells replenished with conditioned
  medium (CM) from 344SQ scramble and shSyt11 cells. Scale bars, 100 μm.(F) Western
  blot analysis of MMP1 and MMP2 in CM collected from 344SQ scramble and shSyt11 cells.
  Densitometric analysis of the blots was performed using ImageJ.(G) 344SQ cells with
  stable Syt11 knockdown form significantly fewer lung metastatic nodules compared
  with the scramble control.(H) Masson trichrome staining detecting collagen (blue)
  in 344SQ control and Syt11 knockdown syngeneic tumors. Scale bars, 50 μm.See also
  . Data represented as mean ± SD. Significance by Student’s t test. *p < 0.05; **p
  < 0.002.
