caption: 'Genistein inhibited TLR4-mediated MyD88-dependent signaling pathway in SCI
  mice. (a–d) 28 days after genistein treatment, we used immunoblotting to detect
  the expression of TLR4, MyD88, and TRAF6 protein in the SCI area, and the representative
  protein bands were showed in (a), and the gray value comparison of protein bands
  was shown in (b)–(d). Five mice in each group, and data were expressed as mean ±
  SD. P value was calculated by post hoc comparisons. ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. SCI group.
  #P < 0.05 and ###P < 0.001 vs. sham group.'
