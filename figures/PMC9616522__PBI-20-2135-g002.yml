caption: 'Chemical screening identifies apigenin and luteolin as biofilm inducers
  for the nitrogen‐fixing bacteria Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus. (a) Chemical
  screening was performed in the 96‐well plate with each well containing: 198 μL of
  the Kitaake roots exudate and 2 μL of the 10 mm compound from the chemical libraries.
  Equal volume (2 μL) of DMSO was added to the well and served as the negative control.
  Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus was added to the final OD600 = 0.01 to each well
  and incubated in a shaker at 150 rpm, 28 °C for 3 day before biofilm quantification
  by crystal violet staining. The value of each well in biofilm quantification was
  normalized to that of the DMSO control in each plate (DMSO = 1). The heatmap was
  generated by the mean value of 3 biological replicates for each compound using MORPHEUS
  software (https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/). (b) Chemical structures
  and hierarchical clustering of the top 21 positive regulators of biofilm based on
  pairwise compound similarities defined using the Atom Pair descriptors and Tanimoto
  coefficiency (http://chemmine.ucr.edu/). The chemicals are also clustered into three
  groups with different colours by the K‐Means algorithm. Pink dots in the inner cycles
  represent molecular weight of each compound. (c) Key intermediates in the flavone
  biosynthetic pathway and their chemical structures. (d) Flavone‐induced biofilm
  formation in Gluconacetobacter diaztrophicus. Values are the Mean ± SD (n = 4).
  **P < 0.01 (One‐way ANOVA followed by Dunnett''s test compared with DMSO control).'
