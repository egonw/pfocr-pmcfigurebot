caption: (A) DEGs between responder and nonresponder tumor cells plotted on a differential
  clustering heatmap. Teal box=nonresponders and untreated, pink box=responders. (B)
  Quantification of DEGs comparing untreated vs. responders to untreated vs, nonresponders.
  (C) DEGs from responding and nonresponding tumors compared to published gene sets
  for apoptosis/DNA damage. Red=upregulated genes; green=downregulated genes; both
  are compared to untreated. N=5 untreated, 10 irradiated (4 responders, 6 nonresponders).
  (D) Immunohistochemistry performed on d14 untreated or irradiated tumors against
  anti- cleaved caspase 3, HMGB1 (E), calreticulin (F). N=10 untreated, 7 nonresponders,
  4 responders. (G) Pathway analysis of DEGs from responding (R) sorted tumor cells
  compared to nonresponding (NR).D, E, F - Statistical significance by ANOVA.
