figure_title: CDK-2 is required for dpl-1 and chd-1-mediated suppression of zyg-1
caption: (A) Percent embryonic lethality among the progeny of wild-type and zyg-1(it25)
  dpl-1(bs21) strains following smd-1 (control) and cdk-2 RNAi. The progeny of wild-type
  animals subjected to cdk-2(RNAi) exhibit a small reduction in viability. In contrast,
  viability among the progeny of zyg-1(it25) dpl-1(bs21) animals subjected to cdk-2(RNAi)
  is almost completely lost, indicating that CDK-2 plays an important role in dpl-1-mediated
  suppression. *** p<0.0001, two-tailed t test with Welch’s correction. (B) Percent
  embryonic lethality in wild-type and chd-1(bs122); zyg-1(it25) strains following
  smd-1 (control) and cdk-2 RNAi. The progeny of wild-type animals subjected to cdk-2(RNAi)
  exhibit a small but insignificant reduction in viability. In contrast, viability
  among the progeny of zyg-1(it25) dpl-1(bs21) animals subjected to cdk-2(RNAi) is
  significantly reduced, indicating that CDK-2 plays an important role in chd-1-mediated
  suppression. ** p<0.001, ns = not significant, two-tailed t test with Welch’s correction.
  (C) Left. Immunoblot of whole cdk-2::aid; TIR-1::mRuby worms probed for SAS-6 and
  α-tubulin. The SAS-6 band is identified by its reduction in intensity upon sas-6(RNAi).
  smd-1(RNAi)serves as a negative control. The presence or absence of auxin in the
  growth media is indicated. Right. Quantitation of SAS-6 levels. (D) Left. Immunoblot
  of whole cdk-2::aid; TIR-1::mRuby worms probed for SAS-5 and α-tubulin. The SAS-5a
  and SAS-5c bands are identified based on their reduction in intensity upon sas-5(RNAi).
  smd-1(RNAi)serves as a negative control. The presence or absence of auxin in the
  growth media is indicated. Right. Quantitation of SAS-5a levels. (E) Model of regulatory
  scheme (created with BioRender.com). In germ line nuclei, EFL-1/DPL-1 and CHD-1
  independently down regulate expression of the cdk-2 gene. CDK-2 protein in turn
  promotes the expression of SAS-6. Under normal conditions, this pathway ensures
  that embryos ultimately inherit the proper amount of SAS-6 to support centriole
  duplication during the embryonic cell divisions. The dashed arrow indicates that
  CHD-1 also functions in a CDK-2-independent capacity to regulate centriole assembly.
