caption: 'The presumptive anterior paraxial mesoderm cells are incorporated into the
  anterior notochord after FGFR inhibition. One representative embryo is presented
  for control (n=4/4) and SU5402-treated conditions (n=7/7). G4 stage control (A-C)
  and SU5402-treated (G-I) embryos after Kaede protein photoconversion in presumptive
  paraxial mesoderm and ventral epidermis. Images are blastopore views with dorsal
  towards the top. The fluorescence was later observed in the corresponding embryos
  at the T0 stage. (D-F,J-O) Orthogonal views are shown (xy below the main panel,
  yz on the right), and single channel as well as merged channel images are presented.
  For SU5402-treated embryo at T0, two orthogonal views are shown: one at the anterior
  level (J-L) and one at the posterior level (M-O). In controls (D-F), the red fluorescence
  (magenta) was observed in the ventral epidermis (arrowhead in F) and in the paraxial
  mesoderm (encircled by a white line in F) all along the antero-posterior axis. In
  SU5402-treated embryos (J-O), the red fluorescence was observed in the ventral epidermis
  (white arrowhead in L and O) as well as in the anterior notochord (encircled by
  a white line in L) and in the posterior somites (encircled by a white line in O).
