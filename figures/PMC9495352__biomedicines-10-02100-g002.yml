caption: The mammalian Arg/N-degron pathway. In mammals, Ubr1, Ubr2, Ubr4, and Ubr5
  E3 ligases are N-recognins of the Arg/N-degron pathway. Arg/N-recognins have at
  least two binding sites each for type 1 or type 2 primary destabilizing Nt-residues.
  The tertiary N-terminal (Nt-) destabilizing residues are N-terminally deamidated
  (Nt-deamidation) by Nt-amidase, Ntan1 for Nt-Asn residue, and Ntaq1 for Nt-Gln residue,
  respectively. The Nt-Cys residue is exceptional; when Nt-Cys residue is oxidized
  (denoted by C*), it becomes the secondary Nt-destabilizing residue (but not always).
  The secondary Nt-destabilizing residues are Nt-arginylated by Arg-tRNA-transferase
  Ate1. Amino acid residues are denoted by single-letter abbreviations, and the rest
  of a substrate protein is denoted by an orange cloud (adapted from [,]).
