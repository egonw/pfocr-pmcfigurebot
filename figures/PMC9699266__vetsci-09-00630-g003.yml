caption: M. bovis inhibits mTOR signaling pathway in EBL cells. (A) Relative mRNA
  expression of mTOR marker genes, mTOR and IGF-1, was evaluated using qPCR assay
  after treatment with the M. bovis for different times in EBL cells. The mRNA levels
  were normalized to that of Gapdh. (B) Western blot analyses of phosphorylation level
  of S6K1 (pS6K1) expression in EBL cells after treatment with the M. bovis for different
  times. S6K1 was used as a control for the loading proteins. (C) The intensity of
  immunoblots was evaluated with ImageJ. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM of three
  triplicates. ns, no significant difference. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 (Student’s t-test).
