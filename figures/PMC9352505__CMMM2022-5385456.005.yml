caption: 'High-risk group possessed a high immune infiltration and TIDE score. (a–d)
  The immune infiltration was evaluated by (a) ESTIMATE, (b) QUANTISEQ, (c) MCPcounter,
  and (d) ssGSEA algorithms between low- and high-risk groups. (e) TIDE score in low-
  and high-risk groups. (f) The proportion of patients who may response to ICIs in
  low- and high-risk groups. TIDE: tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion; ssGSEA:
  single-sample gene set enrichment analysis; immune checkpoint inhibitors: ICIs;
  ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.'
