caption: 'Efforts of TRPM4 overexpression on tumor cell growth and migration and survival
  analysis. (A) Representative immunohistochemical staining for TRPM4. TRPM4 was nearly
  silenced in tumor tissues, while it was highly expressed mainly in the cytoplasm
  of paired non-tumor tissues. Original magnification: 400×. (B) Overall survival
  analysis results in CRC patients. (C) TRPM4 inhibited tumor growth in nude mice.
  Results of tumor growth in nude mice inoculated subcutaneously with HT29/Mock and
  HT29/TRPM4 cells. *: p<0.05. (D) TRPM4 expression in stably transfected cells verified
  by RT-PCR and Western blot. (E) Representative colony formation assay and quantitative
  analysis. (F) Migration assay and quantitative analysis. (G) Wound-healing assay.
  Original magnification: 100×. All values are the mean ± s.d. of three independent
  experiments. *: p<0.05.'

  metastasis through Ca2+/Calpain-mediated proteolysis of FAK and suppression of PI3K/Akt/mTOR
