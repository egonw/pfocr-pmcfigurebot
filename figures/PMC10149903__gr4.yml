caption: Effect of fasting and refeeding on YAP signaling pathway. (A) Western blot
  analysis of total YAP, cytoplasmic p-YAP (Ser127), nuclear YAP and its downstream
  targets ANKRD1, CYR61 and CTGF for different fasted groups; (B) Quantification of
  total YAP, cytoplasmic p-YAP (Ser127), nuclear YAP for different fasted groups (n = 3);
  (C) Quantification of ANKRD1, CYR61 and CTGF for different fasted groups (n = 3);
  (D) Western blot analysis of total YAP, cytoplasmic p-YAP (Ser127), nuclear YAP
  and its downstream targets ANKRD1, CYR61 and CTGF for different refed groups; (E)
  Quantification of total YAP, cytoplasmic p-YAP (Ser127), nuclear YAP for different
  refed groups (n = 3); (F) Quantification of ANKRD1, CYR61 and CTGF for different
  refed groups (n = 3). Data are presented as mean ± SD. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001
  and ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001 versus Fed group. Statistical significance was determined by
  two-way ANOVA or two-tailed Student's t tests.
