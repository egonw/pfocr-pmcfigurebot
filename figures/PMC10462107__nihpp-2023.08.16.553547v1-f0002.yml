figure_title: The proposed cellular de-doping mechanisms and OECT output changes induced
  by S. oneidensis MR-1
caption: (a) Illustration of the MtrCAB pathway directing electrons to extracellular
  electron acceptors. (b) Proposed channel de-doping mechanisms through direct and
  mediated EET. Path 1, cellular metabolic electrons are transferred directly to the
  PEDOT:PSS channel. Path 2, electrons are transferred to the channel via the gate
  and external circuits (circuits not shown). (c) The IDS/IDS0 curve for OECTs inoculated
  with S. oneidensis MR-1, cells were supplemented with 20 mM sodium lactate and no
  additional electron acceptors. Initial inoculum OD600 = 0.01. (d, e) Fitted rate
  constants for S. oneidensis inoculated OECT with different (d) inoculation densities
  (OD600) or (e) carbon sources. Samples with different inoculation densities were
  supplemented with 20 mM sodium lactate as the carbon source. Carbon source and starvation
  samples were prepared at an inoculation OD600 of 0.01 and supplemented with either
  20 mM sodium lactate (Lac.), 20 mM sodium pyruvate (Pyr.), or 20 mM sodium acetate
  (Ace.). No carbon source was added to the starved cells (Stv.). (f) Transfer curves
  were measured in the presence and absence of S. oneidensis. The shaded region indicates
  the range of standard deviation. (g) UV-Vis spectra of the PEDOT:PSS channel in
  the presence and absence of S. oneidensis. (h) IDS decay profiles compared for OECTs
  biased at different gate voltages and gate-removed 2-electrode devices. Representation
  of p-values (n.s. p > 0.05, * p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤ 0.001, **** p ≤ 0.0001)
  and data show the mean ± SD of 3 biological replicates.
