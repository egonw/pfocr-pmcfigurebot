caption: Silencing of UPK3A inhibits the activity and proliferation of gastric cancer
  cells. (a) The expression of UPK3A both in SNU-216 and HGC-27 cells was detected
  by Western blot assay. (b) The cell viability of SNU-216 and HGC-27 was detected
  by MTT assay. (c) The cell growth of SNU-216 and HGC-27 cells was measured by colony
  formation assay. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. Mock group and si-NC group.
