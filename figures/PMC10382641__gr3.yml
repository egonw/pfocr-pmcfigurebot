caption: 'Overexpressing NRG1 enhances DNA synthesis in trophoblasts and promotes
  NF-κB pathway activation (A) NRG1 overexpression in trophoblasts was confirmed at
  the mRNA level by qPCR. (B) Representative EdU uptake assay results for trophoblasts
  overexpressing NRG1 in which EdU uptake (red) was used to detect proliferating trophoblasts
  while DAPI (blue) was used to counterstain all cells. (C) Representative flow cytometry
  plots corresponding to the cell cycle distributions of trophoblasts overexpressing
  NRG1. (D) NRG1 and NF-κB pathway-related protein expression was detected in transfected
  trophoblasts via Western immunoblotting. GAPDH served as a normalization control.
  Student''s t-test: **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.'
