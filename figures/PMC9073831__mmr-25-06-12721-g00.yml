caption: Knockdown of NUSAP1 inhibits the proliferation of nephroblastoma cells. (A)
  RT-qPCR and (B) western blotting were performed to detect the expression of NUSAP1
  in nephroblastoma cell lines. ***P<0.001 vs. 293T. (C) RT-qPCR and (D) western blotting
  were performed to detect the expression of NUSAP1 after cell transfection. (E) MTT
  was conducted to detect cell viability. (F) Colony formation and (G) EdU staining
  assays were performed to detect cell proliferation. **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 vs. shRNA-NC.
  NUSAP1, nucleolar and spindle-associated protein 1; RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; NC, negative control.
article_title: Transcription factor HOXB2 upregulates NUSAP1 to promote the proliferation,
  invasion and migration of nephroblastoma cells via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
