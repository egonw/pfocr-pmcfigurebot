figure_title: Defective proliferation and DNA damage in Skiv2l-deficient early B cells
caption: (A) Representative plots showing sorting of pro-/large pre-B cells of Skiv2lfl/flCd79aCre
  mice versus Skiv2lfl/fl controls for RNA sequencing (n=3 mice per genotype).(B)
  RNA sequencing IGV tracks showing Skiv2l deletion (exon 3-10) in Skiv2lfl/flCd79aCre
  pro/large pre-B cells cells compared to Skiv2lfl/fl control cells.(C) Volcano plot
  showing differential mRNA expression (excluding Igh) in Skiv2lfl/flCd79aCre versus
  Skiv2lfl/fl early B cells (n=3 mice per genotype). Horizontal dashed line, P=0.05.(D)
  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of differentially expressed genes. Top pathways were
  ranked with −log10(P-value) (red). Coverage (blue) represents the percentage of
  the differentially expressed transcripts among the gene set of individual pathways.(E)
  Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of Skiv2lfl/fl and Skiv2lfl/flCd79aCre pro/large
  pre-B cells cells RNA-seq dataset. GSEA plots of KEGG cell cycle and hallmark G2M
  checkpoint are shown. NES, normalized enrichment score. FDR, false discovery rate.(F,
  G) Cell cycle analysis of pro-/large pre-B cells in bone marrow of Skiv2lfl/flCd79aCre
  mice and Skiv2lfl/fl littermate controls (n=3 mice per genotype). Representative
  histograms are shown in (F). Quantitation of each cell cycle phase is shown in (G).
  Data are shown as means ± SEM and are representative of at least two independent
  experiments. Unpaired t test, **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ns, not significant.(H,
  I) Flow cytometry analysis of γ-H2A.X in pro-/large pre-B cells of Skiv2lfl/flCd79aCre
  mice versus Skiv2lfl/fl controls (n=9 mice per genotype). Representative histograms
  are shown in (H) and geometric mean fluorescence intensity (gMFI) of γ-H2A.X in
  (I). Data are shown as means ± SEM and are the pool of at least three independent
  experiments. Unpaired t test, ***P < 0.001.
