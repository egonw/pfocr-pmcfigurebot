caption: 'Logistic regression of clinical characteristics and biomarkers associated
  with severe–critical disease (A) and death (B) from COVID-19, adjusted for time
  from symptom onset to specimen collection. Multiparameter Spearman’s correlation
  analysis was used to generate heat maps demonstrating correlations between biomarkers
  in those with mild–moderate COVID-19 (C) and severe–critical disease (D) (statistically
  significant [P < .05] correlations are highlighted by colored circles, with red
  indicating positive and yellow highlighting negative assocations). The total number
  of positive correlations (r > 0.30) was notably different between those with mild–moderate
  disease compared with severe–critical. No negative correlations with r < –0.30 were
  identified. Abbreviations: ALC, absolute lymphocyte count; ANC, absolute neutrophil
  count; AT3, antithrombin III; BMI, body mass index; CIC-C1q, circulating immune
  complexes–C1q; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; COVID-19, coronavirus
  disease 2019; CRP, C-reactive protein; IFNγ, interferon-γ; IL-6Rα, interleukin-6
  receptor-α; PAD-4, peptidylarginine deaminase–4; PTX3, pentraxin-3; SAA, serum amyloid
  A; sICAM-1, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule–1; sVCAM-1, soluble vascular
  cell adhesion molecule-1; TFPI, tissue factor pathway inhibitor; TM, thrombomodulin;
  TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; TPO, thrombopoietin.'
