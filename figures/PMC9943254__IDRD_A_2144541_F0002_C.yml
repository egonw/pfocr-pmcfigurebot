caption: The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the glutaminolysis pathway interact
  in cancer, and both are frequently dysregulated. The metabolism of glutamine is
  essential for the survival and growth of numerous types of cancer cells. Increased
  expression of the oncogene MYC results in an increase in glutamine absorption and
  glutaminolysis in cancer cells. Both the TCA cycle and glutaminolysis contribute
  to an increase in citrate and acetyl-CoA, which ultimately results in a rise in
  the fatty acid pool. Reactions that are upregulated in cancer cells are shown by
  thicker black arrows, and upregulated enzymes are highlighted in bold font. Red
  indicates current clinical or preclinical cancer medicines that target enzymes related
  to lipogenesis, the TCA cycle, or glutaminolysis. Cancer cell oncogenes that stimulate
  lipogenesis, the TCA cycle, or glutaminolysis are denoted in blue. Reproduce with
