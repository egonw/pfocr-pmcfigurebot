caption: Schematic illustration of two superimposed PROPS (A) and BPA (B) randomly
  generated BNs of JAK-STAT-SOCS signaling. (A) Edges in red and blue represent those
  unique to the two PROPS-reconstructed BNs, respectively; (B) edges in orange and
  green represent those unique to the two BPA-reconstructed BNs, respectively. The
  low coincidence of the edges contained in the two networks can be observed, indicating
  the randomness of the BN structures by the two approaches.
