caption: 'Schematic representation of SDH deficiency–induced insulinopenic T2D. A:
  Reduced SDHB and increased SIRT5 protein expression are features of human T2D. B:
  SDH deficiency directly impairs the OCR and increases succinate accumulation. C:
  Under basal glucose conditions, ΔΨm is hyperpolarized and succinate aberrantly induces
  mTORC1-regulated lipid synthesis. At stimulatory glucose levels, further increased
  succinate impairs maintenance of ΔΨm and reduces ATP generation, compromising insulin
  secretion. Treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin (blue arrows) reduces succinate
  levels and lowers ΔΨm under basal conditions. Importantly, rapamycin rescues the
  paradoxical loss of ΔΨm with high glucose exposure and improves GSIS. D: Mitochondrial
  dysfunction (respiratory deficits, compromised bioenergetics, and metabolic alterations)
  leads to progressive β-cell failure and pubertal-age onset of insulinopenic diabetes
  in SDHBβKO mice. We propose the loss of SDH activity and mTORC1 pathway activation
  as pathogenic features of diabetes. Consequently, targeted mTORC1 inhibition with
  rapamycin may be a potential therapeutic strategy for mitochondrial dysfunction–associated
  β-cell failure. Cyt c, cytochrome c.'
