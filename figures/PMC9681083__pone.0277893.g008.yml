figure_title: FD268 regulates cell survival related genes and pathways in HL-60 cells
caption: (A) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of RNA-seq
  data in 0.125 μM FD268-treated group. The top six enriched pathways of common deferentially
  expressed genes are shown. The DEGs are involved in several metabolic pathways related
  to cell survival including PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and a set of main metabolism
  and signal transduction pathways was involved. (B) Overlapped deferentially expressed
  target genes of 0.125 μM FD268-treated and 0.5 μM FD268-treated group. (C) Expression
  profiles of overlapped common of target genes. The color in heatmap represents the
  normalized expression value.

  and induces apoptosis via inhibiting PI3K pathway in acute myeloid leukemia.
