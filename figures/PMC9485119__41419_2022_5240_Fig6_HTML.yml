figure_title: WEE2-AS1 regulates MOB1A proteasomal degradation by enhancing its binding
  to E3 ligases praja2
caption: 'A Level of praja2 detected by WB in RNA pulldown products. B Level of WEE2-AS1
  detected by qRT-PCR after RIP for praja2 in HCT 116 and HT-29 cells. C Dual RNA-FISH
  and immunofluorescence assays: WEE2-AS1 (red), praja2 (green) (scale bar: 10 μm).
  D Coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot assay indicate the interaction between
  MOB1A and praja2 in HCT 116 and HT-29 cells. E praja2 immunoprecipitated using an
  anti-MOB1A antibody in WEE2-AS1 knockdown or overexpression cells. F MOB1A immunoprecipitated
  using an anti-praja2 antibody in WEE2-AS1 knockdown or overexpression cells. G HCT
  116 and HT-29 cells with WEE2-AS1 knockdown or overexpression were transfected with
  the indicated constructs and the cells then were treated with MG132 (20 μM) for
  8 h before collection. The whole-cell lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation
  with anti-Flag antibody and western blot with anti-HA antibody to detect ubiquitylated
  MOB1A. H Working model for WEE2-AS1 mediating MOB1A degradation through proteasomal
  degradation. Data are shown as mean ± SD of three independent experiments. ***P < 0.001.'
