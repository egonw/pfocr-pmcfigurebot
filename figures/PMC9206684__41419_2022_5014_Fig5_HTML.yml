figure_title: Ct-OATP1B3 facilitates IGF2BP2 binding to its mRNA targets
caption: A Ct-OATP1B3 promotes the formation of IGF2BP2 homodimer in HGSOC cells.
  B RIP assay shows Ct-OATP1B3 enhances the binding of IGF2BP2 to its mRNA targets
  CTP1A and NDUFA2. C GSEA analysis demonstrates that increased expression of Ct-OATP1B3
  in HGSOC tissues is related to the mitochondrial OXPHOS pathway. D Ct-OATP1B3 enhances
  CPT1A and NDUFA2 mRNA stabilities after actinomycin D treatment. E, F Ct-OATP1B3
  enhances CPT1A and NDUFA2 expression in OVCAR3 (E) and CAOV3 (F) cells. *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
