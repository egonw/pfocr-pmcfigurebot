caption: Model and cell responses compared to psychophysical data. (A) Set of contrast
  response curves with different half-saturation constants using . Rmax has been adjusted
  for each curve so as to give the same initial slope (contrast gain of 7 imp/% contrast
  for all curves). (B) Detection (arrowed) and discrimination curves for the half-saturation
  constants using . A 10 imp/sec criterion was used. Curve shape is strongly dependent
  on half-saturation constant. (C) Flash response detection/discrimination for psychophysical
  data compared with MC and PC cell curves. The data points have been replotted from  and
  . The cell curves have been replotted from C. Both psychophysical and physiological
  data were acquired at mid-photopic levels, and the psychophysical data have been
  scaled appropriately. Psychophysical and MC cell data differ in detail, but the
  MC pathway has the ability to support both detection and discrimination. (D) Moving
  stimulus response detection/discrimination curves for psychophysical data compared
  with MC and PC cell curves. Psychophysical data have been replotted from . Physiological
  curves are from , with scaling as in C. Again, the MC pathway has the ability to
  support both detection and discrimination.
