caption: A model for ASF1 binding H4 (ASF1-H4) to interact with GTR1 and then to mediate
  asexual reproduction in Stemphylium eturmiunum. ASF1 interacts with H4 and then
  they are translocated into nuclei through the nuclear pore. The dimer of ASF1-H4
  regulates DNA replication and damage repair in previous studies. Herein, ASF1-H4
  combines with GTR1 to constitute a trimeric complex which in turn is involved in
  the central regulatory pathway to modulate asexual reproduction.
