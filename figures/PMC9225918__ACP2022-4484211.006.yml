caption: Anlotinib combined with 5-FU affected cell proliferation and angiogenesis
  in vivo. 24 male BALB/c-nu mice were randomly divided into four groups treated with
  oral saline, 1.5 mg/kg anlotinib, 100 mg/kg 5-FU, or both of anlotinib and 5-FU.
  (a) Tumor volume in mice after 21-day treatment. (b) The protein expression for
  each group. (c) The relative protein expression levels of each group. The results
  are from three independent experiments. ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 compared with anlotinib.
