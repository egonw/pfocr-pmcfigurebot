figure_title: Neoadjuvant ENZ deactivates AR signaling and induces neuroendocrine
  (NE)-like gene expression signatures
caption: (A) Principal component analysis (PCA) plot based on gene expression data.
  Color indicates pre-treatment (gray) and post-treatment (black) samples. Ellipses
  are based on the 80% confidence interval.(B) Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA)
  for Hallmark gene sets. Shown are the top differentially enriched pathways upon
  ENZ treatment. Y-axis indicates the normalized enrichment score (NES).(C) Enrichment
  plot of the Hallmark Androgen Response pathway. Genes are ranked by differential
  expression upon ENZ treatment based on patient RNA-seq data (post vs. pre). Y-axis
  indicates enrichment score (ES). GSEA statistics (FDR, ES, NES, nominal P-value)
  are indicated.(D) Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of pre- and post-treatment
  RNA-seq samples based on the expression of AR-responsive genes. Color scale indicates
  gene expression (z-score).(E) River plot showing state transitions between Clusters
  1 (dark blue), Cluster 2 (green) and Cluster 3 (light blue) for paired pre-treatment
  and post-treatment RNA-seq samples (n=39). Number of samples assigned to each cluster
  before and after treatment as well as the hallmarks per cluster are indicated.(F)
  Waterfall plot depicting the Pearson correlation of neuroendocrine gene expression
  signature fold changes upon ENZ treatment per patient. Colors indicate the patients
  cluster affiliations after treatment.
