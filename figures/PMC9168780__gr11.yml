caption: 'Various roles of H2S as a cytoprotective factor in cancer cells. H2S can
  lead to the upregulation of various antioxidant systems. H2S can stimulate Nrf2/ARE
  pathway through: sulfhydration of Keap1 (at Cys151), that in turn, undergoes a conformational
  change which leads to the dissociation of Nrf2 from the Keap1-Cul3-RBX1 E3 ligase
  complex. Subsequently, the free Nrf2 translocates into the nucleus to induce a global
  change in gene expression, which includes the upregulation of a host of antioxidant
  genes and enzyme systems. H2S can stimulate PI3K/Akt, ERK1/2 and mTOR pathways,
  already discussed in . H2S can stimulate NF-kB pathway through: sulfhydration of
  NF-kB at Cys38. H2S can stimulate HSP90 pathway. The activation of these pathways
  confers general cytoprotection and cancer cell resistance to chemotherapeutic agents
  induced cytotoxicity. However, in the context of chemotherapeutic agents, additional,
  more specific mechanisms may also be involved in the protection provided by H2S.
  H2S can stimulate STAT3/Akt/Bcl-2 pathway through Akt activation. H2S can also promote
  the upregulation of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and thymidylate synthetase (TYMS).'
