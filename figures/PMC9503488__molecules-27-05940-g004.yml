caption: 'β2-AR is involved in E/NE-induced Src activation and the metastatic ability
  of Hep3B and MDA-MB-231 cells. (A–G) Hep3B human HCC cells and MDA-MB-231 human
  BC cells were transfected with control siRNA or ADRB2 siRNA #1, #2, and #3 (see
  Materials and Methods). (A) At 24 h post-transfection, the expression of ADRB2 was
  assessed by real-time PCR. (B,C) At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were treated
  with E (10 μM) or NE (1 μM) for 2 h. Phosphorylated Src and total Src were detected
  by Western blot analysis. Actin was used as the internal control. The representative
  images of duplicate experiments are shown (B). The ratio of phosphorylated/total
  Src was calculated using ImageJ software after normalization to actin (C). (D–G)
  At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were seeded again onto the inserts of transwell
  plates and treated with E (10 μM) or NE (1 μM). After 24 h of incubation, the migrated
  (D,E) or invaded (F,G) cells were stained and photographed (×100 magnification).
  (D,F) Representative images from triplicate analyses are shown. (D,F) Relative migration
  (E) and invasion (G) of E/NE-treated cells compared with untreated control cells
  was calculated by counting the stained cells. The data are expressed as the mean
  ± SD of three independent experiments. Significance was determined by the Student’s
  t-test (*** p < 0.001 vs. relative control). HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; BC,
  breast cancer; E, epinephrine; NE, norepinephrine.'
