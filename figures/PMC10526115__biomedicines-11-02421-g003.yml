caption: Schematic representation summarizing the regulation of cellular glucose uptake
  based on publication []. Depending on the corresponding receptors on the cell surface,
  cytokines, growth factors, neurotransmitters (Akt1/3), and insulin (Akt2) (magenta
  circle) activate the serine/threonine kinase Akt, which coordinates the translocation
  of Glut-loaded vesicles to the plasma membrane. Missing ligand binding to the respective
  receptors downregulates the Akt pathway and triggers intracellular glucose depletion.
  Several survival pathways are immediately initiated. Inhibition of Akt induces ER
  stress and the upregulation of ferritin, thereby reducing intracellular iron levels
  and stabilizing HIF1α (green circle). Metabolism shifts from oxidative phosphorylation
  (oxP) to glycolysis because the synthesis of iron–sulfur proteins in the mitochondria
  is downregulated. Concurrently, the expression of Glut1 and Glut3 is increased.
  Further loss of energy and iron activates AMPK, which fuels the cell with glucose
  through Glut4 translocation (yellow circle). This pathway is promoted by metformin.
  Another survival pathway is induced by ATF4/6 in the ER stress response. H2S increases
  autophagy and inhibits ER stress and ferroptosis (grey circle). Aß, beta-amyloid;
