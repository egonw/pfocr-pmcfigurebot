caption: Effect of Rg1 on the differentiation and senescence in Sca-1+ HSC/HPCs. (a,
  b) SA-β-gal reflects the level of cell senescence; blue positive cells could be
  found in aging cells, Bar = 20 μm. (c, d) The expression of P53 and P21 by western
  blot. (e) The mRNA level of p53 and p21. (f, g) Colony-forming capacity can react
  with the multidirectional differentiation properties of HSCs, Bar = 150 μm.  ∗P
  < 0.05 as compared with the control group; aP < 0.05 as compared with the LiCl group.
