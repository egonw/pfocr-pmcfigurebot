caption: Interaction between oxidative stress genes and transcription factors at the
  transcriptomic level. (A) Venn diagram shows transcription factor (TF) genes involved
  in their in vivo expression among differentially expressed genes (DEGs). (B) Four
  upregulated and four downregulated transcription factor genes were validated by
  qPCR. Heatmap shows the relative expression levels of genes. Seq, RNA sequencing.
  (C) Venn diagram shows oxidative stress genes among differentially expressed genes
  (DEGs). (D) Validation of the expression of nine oxidative stress genes by qPCR
  showed increased expression of five genes and decreased expression of four genes.
  Heatmap shows the relative expression levels of genes. (E) Interconnection network
  between oxidative stress and transcription factor genes. The red and purple colors
  denote transcription factors and oxidative stress genes, respectively. Comparisons
  were performed using a Studentâ€™s t-test. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001.
