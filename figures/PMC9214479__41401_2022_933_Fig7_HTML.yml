figure_title: HSC inhibited the inflammatory response of neutrophils
caption: 'a Neutrophils were treated with HSC for 1 h and then with fMLP (1 μM) for
  20 min. The activity of elastase was determined by ELISA kit. b MMP-9 was determined
  by ELISA kits. Data were shown as mean ± SD (n = 3). c Neutrophils were treated
  with HSC (0.1, 1, 10 μM) for 1 h, and then treated with fMLP (1 μM) for 20 min.
  The medium supernatant from neutrophils was collected and added into the Caco-2
  cells for 2 h. Western blotting analysis of MAPK/NF-κB pathway protein level. d
  Statistical analysis of p-JNK, p-ERK, p-p38, and p-p65 protein level. #P < 0.05
  vs control group; *P < 0.05 vs fMLP group.'
