caption: 'MLT receptors in human meibocytes and MLT concentration selection. (A) Expression
  of MT1 and MT2 in human MG specimens detected by immunohistochemical staining. Scale
  bar: 100 µm. (B) Expression of MT1 and MT2 in HMGECs depicted by immunofluorescence
  staining. Scale bar: 20 µm. (C) The HMGECs received MLT in a concentration-dependent
  manner for 48 hours to evaluate cell viability. (D) The HMGECs incubated with 100
  µM MLT to 48 hours to assess cell growth rate (n = 3). ***Significantly different
  from control, P < 0.001.'
