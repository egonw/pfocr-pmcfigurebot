caption: PDCoV infection induces activation of the PERK–eIF2α pathway and host translation
  attenuation. (A) Western blot analysis of eIF2α phosphorylation. LLC-PK1 cells were
  mock-infected or infected with PDCoV (MOI = 5) for 3, 6, 9, or 12 h. Cells were
  collected and subjected to western blot analysis for the detection of phosphorylated
  eIF2α, total eIF2α, and PDCoV N protein. β-actin was used as a protein-loading control.
  (B) Analysis of protein synthesis in PDCoV-infected cells. LLC-PK1 cells were infected
  with PDCoV at various doses (MOI = 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1, or 5) for 12 h and then treated
  with puromycin for 25 min, before being used in a western blot analysis with an
  antibody against puromycin. (C–E) Determination of the transcription of ATF4 and
  its downstream genes. LLC-PK1 cells were mock-infected or infected with PDCoV (MOI
  = 5) for 3, 6, 9, or 12 h. The cells were then collected and subjected to quantitative
  real-time RT-PCR analysis of ATF4 (C), CHOP (D), and GADD34 (E) mRNA. (F) Inhibition
  of the PERK–eIF2α pathway in LLC-PK1 cells via treatment with the PERK-specific
  inhibitor ISRIB. LLC-PK1 cells were treated with ISRIB and then infected with PDCoV
  as described in the Materials and methods, before being using in a quantitative
  real-time RT-PCR analysis of ATF4 mRNA. The presented results are the means and
  standard deviations of data from three independent experiments. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01;
  ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001; ns, nonsignificant difference.
