caption: The TCA cycle pathway was inactivated in primary AT2 cells of septic-ALI
  mice. (a) Screening for differentially expressed genes in the peripheral blood of
  healthy donors (N = 34) and septic-ALI patients (N = 30). (b) KEGG analysis of 3918
  downregulated genes and 1372 upregulated genes. (c, d) Expression of ACLY, ACO1,
  CS, DLAT, DLST, FH, IDH1, IDH3A, MDH1, MDH2, PDHA1,PDHB, SDHA, SUCLA2, and SUCLG2
  was detected in the (c) GSE32707 dataset, or in septic-ALI mice (N = 10) and control
  mice (N = 10) via RT-PCR detection in (d) AT2 cells. (e, f) Expression of MDH1 and
  MDH2 was done via (e) WB assay (N = 5) and (f) immunofluorescence assay in AT2 cells
  (N = 5). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
