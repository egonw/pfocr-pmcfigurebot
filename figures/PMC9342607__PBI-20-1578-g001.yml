caption: Analysis of the metabolic profiles of N. benthamiana leaves treated with
  activation programmes (APs) for naringenin, eriodictyol, kaempferol, and quercetin.
  (a) Principal Component Analysis resulting from the untargeted LC‐MS data obtained
  in ESI negative mode from leaves treated with programmes AP‐N3, AP‐E, AP‐K, and
  AP‐Q and control samples (C‐) agroinfiltrated with unprogrammed dCasEV2.1. (b) Hierarchical
  cluster analysis and heat map representation of the Control, AP‐N3, AP‐E, AP‐K,
  and AP‐Q metabolic profiles, with three biological replicates per condition (ESI‐).
  The m/z represented are the 100 most significantly different using an ANOVA analysis
  (P < 0.05). The data were obtained using Euclidean distance and Ward’s minimum variance
  method. Red indicates up‐regulated and blue downregulated features. The asterisk
  symbols represent the m/z selected for quantifying the metabolites in Figure . (c)
  Schematic representation of selected target metabolites of the flavonoid pathway
  and the genes involved in each enzymatic reaction required for their biosynthesis.
  The coloured bars represent the targeted gene for each group (AP‐N3 in orange, AP‐E
  in green, AP‐K in blue, and AP‐Q in red). (d) Relative abundance of identified metabolites.
  The ions employed for the metabolic quantification are the parental ions identified
  in the heat map as single compounds (See also Table ). N, Naringenin; N‐H, Naringenin
  Hexose; N‐G. Naringenin Glucoside; E, Eriodictyol; E‐H, Eriodictyol Hexose; E‐G,
  Eriodictyol Glucoside; K‐DH, Kaempferol Dihexose; K‐DHDO, Kaempferol Dihexose‐deoxyhexose;
  K‐H, Kaempferol Hexose; K‐G, Kaempferol Glucoside; Q‐DH, Quercetin Dihexose; Q‐DHDO,
  Dihexose‐deoxyhexose; Q‐HDO, Quercetin Hexose‐deoxyhexose; Q‐H, Quercetin Hexose;
  Q‐G, Quercetin Glucoside.
