caption: E. coli nitrate reduction generates an oxidant, nitrite, that creates an
  oxidizing redox potential in the bacterial environment and increases the relative
  abundance of Fe3+. E. coli K-12 was incubated in mineral media with nitrate (mM9+NO3)
  or without (mM9–NO3). (a) Growth was measured by optical density at 600 nm (OD600).
  (b) Oxidation–reduction potential (ORP) of bacterial cultures was measured, using
  an electrode, in culture media relative to sterile media. (c) Nitrite was quantified
  in cultures supplied with nitrate using the Griess assay. (d,e) Iron speciation
  was measured using the ferrozine assay in bacterial cultures where (d) media lacked
  nitrate (mM9–NO3) or (e) media was supplemented with nitrate (mM9+NO3). n = 3 biological
  replicates; bars denote means ± S.E.M.
