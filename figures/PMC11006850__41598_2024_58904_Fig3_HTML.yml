caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis using RNA-seq data from ipsilateral and contralateral
  cortical astrocytes of PTE+ and PTE− mice. (A) Graphical summary showing predicted
  inhibition of Il6 in PTE+ mice and other pathways with inferred relationship to
  Il6 including IFNG, IGF1, IL1A, IL5, IL17A. (B) Top ready analysis showing the top
  upregulated and top downregulated genes based on fold-change. (C) The top 8 canonical
  pathways based on + or − z-score. (D) Graphical summary showing predicted activation
  of serine peptidase inhibitor Kazal type 1 (SPINK1) general cancer pathway, as well
  as IL-15 production, KLF4, SOX4 and migration of phagocytes/myeloid cells. (E) Top
  ready analysis showing the top upregulated and top downregulated genes based on
  fold-change. (F) The top 8 canonical pathways based on + or—z-score.
