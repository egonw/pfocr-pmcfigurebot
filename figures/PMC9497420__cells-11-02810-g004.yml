caption: Cell adhesion molecules and leukocyte activation are the CD molecular pathways
  upregulated in cigarette smoke plus morphine (SM + M) treated Tregs. (A) The Venn
  diagram analysis showed that SM + M, morphine (M), and cigarette smoke (SM) specifically
  upregulated the expressions of 14, 17, and 1 cluster of differentiation (CD) respectively
  after screening for a total of 373 CDs in mouse splenic CD4+ Tregs. The SM + M upregulated
  CD group has 7 signaling pathways while the M upregulated CD group has 9 signaling
  pathways. (B) The schematic figure showed the CDs on Treg and the forward signaling
  pathway, and on the other cell types with a reverse signaling pathway.
