caption: Serum metabolites as biomarkers for IIM. (A) The individual plot of IIM-specific
  metabolites was selected by the backward stepwise method for constructing a prediction
  model. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.005; *** p < 0.0005, and **** p < 0.0001. (B) ROC curves
  for seven sets of metabolites with five-fold cross-validation. AUC values were calculated
  for each machine learning method; red indicates logistic regression, blue indicates
  support vector machine, and yellow indicates random forest.
