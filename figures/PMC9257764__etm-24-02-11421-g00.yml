caption: PPAR signaling pathway in dyslipidemia. PPAR regulates lipid metabolism by
  promoting the expression or activity of CYP7A1, ACOX, CPT1 and ABCA1. The blue arrow
  represents fatty acids obtained from dietary intake or the breakdown of adipose
  tissue. The green arrows represent stimulatory modifications. Dashed lines indicate
  various types of PPAR. The figure was generated using Adobe Illustrator CC version
  23.0 (Adobe Systems, Inc.). RXR, retinoid X receptor; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor; LXRα, liver X receptor α; CYP7A1, cholesterol 7 α-hydroxylase; ACOX, acyl-CoA
  oxidase; CPT1, carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1; ABCA1, ATP-binding cassette transporter
  A1; PPRE, peroxisome proliferator response element.
