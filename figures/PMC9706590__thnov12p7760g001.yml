caption: 'hnRNPA2B1 is critical for myeloma disease progression. (A) Pathway enrichment
  analysis in the plasma cells from myeloma patients (n = 12) compared to normal plasma
  cells from healthy donors (n = 5) (GEO: GSE6691). (B) Volcano plot showing genes
  with a cutoff fold-change of ≥ 2 or ≤ -2 and P values of <0.05. (C) Heatmap showing
  the expression profile of genes upregulated or downregulated. (D) hnRNPA2B1 mRNA
  levels in GSE6691. (E) hnRNPA2B1 mRNA levels in malignant plasma cells of 37 myeloma
  patients without bone lesion (BL = 0) and 136 myeloma patients with bone lesion
  (BL ≥ 1) (GEO: GSE755). Data shown as average ± SD. P values were determined by
  Student''s t test. (F) Western blot analysis of hnRNPA2B1 expression in normal plasma
  cells, malignant plasma cells (Pt), and human myeloma cell lines. GAPDH served as
  loading control. Data are representative of triplicate blots. (G) Overall survival
  (OS) and Progression free survival (PFS) of myeloma patients with high hnRNPA2B1
  (High) or low hnRNPA2B1(Low) expression. (H) Myeloma cell line RPMI8226 was infected
  with lentivirus carrying non-targeted control (shCtrl) or short-hairpin RNAs against
  human hnRNPA2B1 (shA2B1). MM.1S was infected with lentivirus carrying control vector
  (Vec) or hnRNPA2B1 complementary DNA (A2B1). After 3 weeks of culture in soft agar,
  the colonies were stained and visualized. Shown are representative images of shA2B1
  (left panel) or A2B1 (right panel) myeloma cell colonies. Each experiment was repeated
  three times. (I) Correlation coefficient of the mRNA levels of hnRNPA2B1 and numbers
  of bone lesion in myeloma patients (n = 30). The correlations were evaluated using
  Pearson coefficient. r, correlation coefficient. P value was determined by Pearson
  coefficient. (J) Representative images of immunohistochemical staining show the
  expression of CD138 and hnRNPA2B1 in the biopsy segment of two patients (P1 and
  P2) which are highlighted with green or red color. Scale bar, 50 µm. Representative
  images of magnetic resonance imaging and X ray scanning for lytic lesions in the
  spine (K) and skull (L) in P1 and P2. Yellow arrows, bone lesion.'
