caption: Bile salt biotransformations by intestinal bacteria. In the human liver,
  two primary bile acids, cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), are synthesized
  from cholesterol via the classic (neutral) pathway in hepatocytes. CDCA is also
  synthesized to a lesser degree by the alternative pathway. Bile acids are conjugated
  to taurine or glycine (not shown) in hepatocytes before secretion into the gallbladder.
  The intermediate, 7⍺-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, is an important serum marker for
  BA synthesis, and it will later become apparent that its metabolism by intestinal
  bacteria provided important clues for the analogous 7⍺-dehydroxylation of CA and
  CDCA to deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA), respectively.
