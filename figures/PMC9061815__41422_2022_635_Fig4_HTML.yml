figure_title: Characterization of LGE development and possible migrating cells
caption: a UMAP clusters of cells in LGE. Clusters of LGE from integrated data were
  selected and LHX8- or SST-expressing cells were trimmed (left). Remaining cells
  were marked in UMAP plot (bottom right) and re-clustered (middle). Trajectory was
  reconstructed and depicted in dash lines based on gene expression pattern and pseudotime
  analysis. b Landscapes of marker genes in various LGE-derived lineages. Background
  colors of genes were consistent with colors of cell lineage groups in a. Dash line
  of gene name frames represents destiny of corresponding cells to vLGE. c. Volcano
  plots of DEGs that are expressed at high levels in olfactory lineage (right, Olfactory
  lineage in a) or striatal lineages (left, three other striatal lineages in a). False
  discovery rates were adjusted by BH method to generate “P. adjust”. d GO enrichment
  of significant DEGs revealed in c in different lineages. False discovery rates were
  analyzed as in c. e Gene profiles of LGE LHX8+ linages. Similar exclusive expression
  pattern could be found between LHX8-EBF1 gene pair and NRP1-SEMA3A gene pair (top).
  Mixed expression feature of LGE LHX8+ lineage, cell type specific genes were also
  detected (bottom). f SEMA3A signaling pathway prediction provided by CellChat, based
  on human cells from integrated data. Colored bars represented the cell types defined
  in Fig. 1a. g PEG10 as a potential migration regulator. Expression level of PEG10
  (left) and schematic model of one activation pathway of PEG10 by MIR7-3HG (right).
  h Pseudotime trajectory and schematic overview of hypothetic differentiation program.
  Markers of matched cell types were labeled nearby.
