caption: 'Senolytics improve the molecular phenotype and function of skeletal muscle
  (SkM) in female mice. (a) heatmap of the differentially expressed genes between
  young and old-vehicle mice which exhibited improvements in the old-DQ treated group.
  (b) GSEA enriched pathways between old-vehicle vs young groups (red) and between
  old-DQ vs old-vehicle groups (blue). X-axis shows the normalized enrichment score.
  Negative NES represent downregulation in the group. (c) GSEA plots of P53 signaling
  pathway between the two group comparisons. (d) qPCR confirmation of the RNAseq data
  in a larger cohort of mice (n = 9 per group; One way ANOVA test). (e) IF laminin
  staining on the SkM samples (Representative image of 4 mice per group). (f) CSA
  distribution in young, old-veh, and old-DQ samples. Asterisks denote the differences
  between young and old-veh groups (n = 4 per group, two way ANOVA). (g) Centrally
  nucleated fibers (CNF) in muscles from different groups (n = 4 per group). (h) Grip
  strength normalized to body weight of mice from different groups (n = 9-10 per group).
  (i) Pearson correlation analysis between gene expression and SkM morphological measures,
  and grip strength, with Pearson r value on the left and p value on the right. Error
  bars represent the standard error of the mean. *, **, and **** denote adjusted p
  value < 0.05, 0.01, and 0.0001 respectively. # denotes FDR q-value < 0.25 in GSEA
  analysis.'
