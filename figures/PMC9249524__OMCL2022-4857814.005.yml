caption: 'Allicin inhibits OS cell growth and migration by inactivation of the expression
  of MALAT1. (a) Apoptosis in Saos-2 and U2OS cell lines, detected by flow cytometry.
  (b) Cell migration in Saos-2 and U2OS cell lines, measured using the transwell assay.
  (c) Cell migration in Saos-2 and U2OS cell lines, determined using the scratch wound
  assay. (d) Cell proliferation in Saos-2 and U2OS cells, analyzed using the CCK-8
  assay. (e) Cell cycle in Saos-2 and U2OS cell lines, detected by flow cytometry.
  State n = 3. Compared with NC, ∗P < 0.05; compared with allicin, #P < 0.05; compared
  with sh-NC, &P < 0.05.'
