caption: Nur77 deletion activates the NF‐κB signalling pathway in the femur. (A) The
  serum levels of hsCRP and IL‐6 in the mice (n = 10). (B‐I) The protein expression
  levels of P‐IKK‐β, IKK‐β, IκB‐α, NF‐κB, p‐NF‐κB, TNF‐α and IL‐6 in Nur77 knockout
  and wild‐type littermate controls. (J) The mRNA expression levels of TGF‐β in the
  mouse femurs. All data are presented as boxplots with medians and interquartile
  ranges and were statistically analysed by Student's t‐test. *p < 0.05 or p < 0.01
  or p < 0.001
