caption: 'The relationship between nCRT‐induced genomic changes and treatment efficacy.
  (A) The oncoprint plot of mutations and copy number variants (CNV) of the paired
  baseline tissue biopsies (the upper row of each gene) and surgical tumour samples
  (the lower row of each gene) in 72 LARC patients. (B,C) The number of non‐synonymous
  mutations (B) and chromosomal instability score (C) in TRG0‐3 patients. (D–F) The
  proportion of cases in TRG0‐3 patients with different post‐nCRT mutation clearance
  status (D), mutation number changes (E) or status of acquired mutations (F). (G)
  KEGG pathway analysis using 18 mutated genes that had increased mutational frequency
  after nCRT treatment. (H) KEGG pathway analysis using the acquired mutated genes
  after nCRT treatment. Abbreviations: LARC, locally advanced rectal cancer; nCRT,
  neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.'
article_title: Genomic features, evolutionary patterns and minimal residual disease
  at surgical margins as novel prognostic/predictive biomarkers in locally advanced
  rectal cancer.
