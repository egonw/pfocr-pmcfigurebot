caption: LTBP2 suppression contributes to ferroptosis. (a, b) The content of GSH decreased,
  while the content of GSSG increased correspondingly after LTBP2 knockout. (c) The
  expression of GPX4 was examined using ELISA, and its activity was obviously suppressed
  when LTBP2 was silenced. (d–f) After silencing of LTBP2, notable decreases in GPX4
  activity and xCT expression were observed. Quantitative data are presented as mean s
  ± SD from three independent experiments. ∗P < 0.01 vs. the control.
