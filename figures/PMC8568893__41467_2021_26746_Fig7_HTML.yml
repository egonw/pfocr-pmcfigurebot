figure_title: Inhibition of the PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 axis reduces the m.3243 A > G mutant
  load
caption: A scheme describing how the m.3243 A > G mutation alters cell metabolism,
  including mitochondrial dysfunction, altered glucose metabolism, redox imbalance
  and oxidative stress, which may lead to the constitutive activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTORC1
  pathway. Pharmacological inhibition of this pathway reduces mutant load, partially
  rescues mitochondrial function and reduces glucose dependence in a cell-autonomous
  way. Although the underlying mechanisms for selecting against the mutant mtDNA need
  further investigations, these findings suggest that the activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTORC1
  pathway drives a positive feedback cycle, which maintains/increases mutant mtDNA,
  augments the metabolic rewiring and thus exacerbates the perturbation of cell signalling.
  This positive feedback loop may shape the phenotype of the disease and determine
  disease progression. The scheme was created using BioRender.com.
