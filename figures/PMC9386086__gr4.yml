caption: Direct binding of berberine to PKM2 promotes ubiquitination to inhibit the
  pathway in colorectal cancer(A) The effect of berberine on PKM2, PKM1, Bcl-2, Cyclin
  D1 expression in HT29 cells was studied using Western blot analysis.(B) Berberine
  promotes PKM2 ubiquitination.(C) PKM2 mRNA levels (n = 6).(D) PKM1 mRNA levels (n =
  6).(E) Bcl-2 mRNA levels (n = 6).(F) Cyclin D1 mRNA levels (n = 6).(G) The effect
  of Sh PKM2 on Bcl-2, Cyclin D1, and STAT3 phosphorylation in HT29 cells was studied
  using Western blot analysis. The data are shown as the mean ± SD of three independent
  experiments. Statistics differences were analyzed by unpaired t test. ∗p < 0.05,
  ∗∗p < 0.01.
