caption: Deletion of GSDMD attenuated the activation of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c‐Met–mediated
  and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)–mediated mitogenic pathways at initiation
  phase of liver regeneration. (A) Examining the activation of HGF/c‐Met and EGFR
  signaling pathway by western blotting for phosphorylated c‐Met (p‐c‐Met), phosphorylated
  EGFR (p‐EGFR)/EGFR, phosphorylated extracellular signal–regulated kinase (p‐ERK)/ERK,
  phosphorylated Akt (p‐Akt)/Akt, and phosphorylated signal transducer and activator
  of transcription‐3 (p‐STAT3)/STAT3 at indicated time points after 70%PH. GAPDH served
  as loading controls. (B) Quantitative PCR for measuring the mRNA levels of HGF and
  EGFR ligands Amphiregulin (Areg), Heparin‐binding epidermal growth factor (HB‐EGF),
  and transforming growth factor α (TGFα) in remnant livers of GSDMD +/+or‐  and GSDMD
  −/−  mice (GSDMD +/+ , n = 3–5/group; GSDMD +/− , n = 0–3/group; GSDMD −/− , n = 3–8/group).
  The sham group were collected at 1 hours after sham surgery. Data are presented
  as mean ± SD; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. IL, interleukin; mTOR, mammalian target of
  rapamycin; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α
