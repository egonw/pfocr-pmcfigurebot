caption: The predicted metabolic pathway of phytosterols in Mycobacterium fortuitum.
  The C19 pathway and C22 pathway are annotated and framed by black and red dotted
  lines, respectively. All edited genes are emphasized in red color. The question
  mark means that the enzyme catalyzing this reaction is not yet known in Mycobacterium
  fortuitum. Phytosterols consist of β-sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol,
  which differ in their R groups. The diagram was drawn based on our previous article
  []. 22-OH-BNC-CoA, 22-hydroxy-3,24-dioxo-4-ene-cholest-CoA; 22-oxo-BNC-CoA, 3,22,24-trioxo-4-ene-cholest-CoA;
  3-OPC-CoA, 3,22-dioxo-4-ene-pregna-CoA; 3-OPA, 3-oxo-4-ene-pregna-20-carboxyaldehyde;
  BA, 22-hydroxy-23, 24-bisnorchol-4-en-3-one; 1,4-BA, 22-hydroxy-23,24-bisnorchol-1,4-dien-3-one;
  9-OHBA, 9,22-dihydroxy-23,24-bisnorchol-4-ene-3-one; AD, 4-androstene-3,17-dione;
