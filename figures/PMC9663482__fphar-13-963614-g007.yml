caption: Quercetin inhibits EMT-like mesenchymal transition and invasion through GSK-3β/β-catenin/ZEB1signaling.
  (A) The cell invasion ability of U87MG and CHG-5 cells was assessed by transwell
  assay after treatment with quercetin alone or combined with SB216763. (B) Western
  blotting analysis of the expression of p-GSK-3β (Ser 9), GSK-3β, β-catenin, and
  ZEB1 after treatment with quercetin alone or combined with SB216763 in U87MG and
  CHG-5 cells. The data are shown as the mean ± SD of three experiments. *p＜0.05,
  **p＜0.01 vs. control group.
