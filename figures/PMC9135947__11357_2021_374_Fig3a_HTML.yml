caption: Transcriptome profile of Psora-4 confirmed that nematodes treated with psora-4
  have enhanced stress response. a GO term analysis, top GO terms targeted by Psora-4
  were defensive responses, transmembrane transport, and oxidation-reduction process,
  based on DEGs with |LFC| > 1 and P-value < 0.05. b As in a only for downregulated
  genes. Top hits are metabolic processes. c As in a for upregulated genes. Top hits
  are oxidation-reduction processes. d Top signaling pathways targeted by Psora-4
  differentially expressed genes based on panther pathway analysis. e Panther GO-slim
  molecular function showed the top classes of differentially expressed genes by Psora-4
  are antioxidant activities. f GO terms enriched by DEGs of Psora-4 were analyzed
  by DAVID [] and summarized by REVIGO []. The top GO terms are metabolic processes.
  X- and Y-axes represent GO termsâ€™ semantic similarity measures in multidirectional
  scaling; the closeness of the groups on the plot reflects their relative similarity
  based on this metric
