caption: 'AND induced phosphorylation of PKC and AMPK signaling pathways. (A) The
  phosphorylation of Akt in L6 cells treatment with insulin and different concentrations
  of AND. The control group was considered as 1 for data analysis. The data represent
  the mean ± s.e.m. of values from three separate experiments. (B) The phosphorylation
  of AMPK in L6 cells treatment with metformin and different concentrations of AND.
  The control group was considered as 1 for data analysis. The data represent the
  mean ± s.e.m. of values from three separate experiments. (C) The phosphorylation
  of PKC in L6 cells treatment with PMA and different concentrations of AND. The control
  group was considered as 1 for data analysis. The data represent the mean ± s.e.m.
  of values from three separate experiments. *: p < 0.05; **: p < 0.01; ***: p < 0.001;
