figure_title: Transcriptomic landscape of ESR1 mutant metastatic breast cancers
caption: A. Schematic overview of transcriptomic analysis of four ER+ metastatic breast
  cancer cohorts.B. Box plots representing the enrichment levels of “Estrogen Response
  Early” and “Estrogen Response Late” signatures in ESR1 mutant versus ESR1 WT metastatic
  tumors in each cohort. (WCRC, 46 ESR1 WT/8 mutant; MET500, 34 ESR1 WT/12 ESR1 mutant;
  DFCI, 98 ESR1 WT/32 mutant; POG570, 68 ESR1 WT/18 mutant). Four quantiles are shown
  in each plot. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the enrichment of the signatures
  in WT and mutant tumors. (* p<0.05, ** p<0.01)C. Volcano plots representing the
  differentially expressing genes (DE genes) in ESR1 mutant tumors versus WT tumors
  in the three metastatic breast cancer cohorts. DE genes were selected using the
  cutoff of FDR<0.1 and |log2FC|>1.5. Genes that were upregulated or downregulated
  were labelled in red and blue respectively with corresponding counts.D. Dot plots
  showing the top 5 altered cellular and molecular functional categories derived from
  DE genes analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Specific sub-functions
  within overarching categories are presented as individual dots. Consistently altered
  pathways across all four cohorts are indicated in red.E. Stacked bar plot showing
  the distribution of 14 hotspot ESR1 mutations identified in six independent cohorts
  using unbiased DNA sequencing approaches. Specific sample numbers were indicated
  in the plots. Variants with percentages above 1% were labelled on the top of each
  bar.F. Scatterplot representing enrichment level distribution of 50 hallmark gene
  sets in 10 Y537S and 8 D538G metastatic tumors (after being normalized against 98
  WT counterparts) from the DFCI cohort. Top enriched pathways from each quartile
  are labelled.
