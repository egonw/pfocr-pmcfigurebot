figure_title: Model of a multistep specification to form CNCCs and the signaling pathways
  disrupted by inactivation of Tbx1
caption: a Colors indicate cell fate progression of pharyngeal NCCs (light yellow)
  towards vascular smooth muscle cells (red). Step 1 shows the transition between
  pharyngeal NCCs expressing Tbx2/3 to cells expressing markers of CNCCs (CP-CNCCs).
  Step 2 shows the transition in which some cells directly differentiate to smooth
  muscle of PAA-CNCCs, while the majority migrate and enter the OFT as OFT-CNCCs and
  express Gata3/Isl1 and Step 3 shows the transition to SM-CNCCs expressing Acta2.
  The graph shows the relative change of biological gene ontology terms during the
  three transitions of CNCCs to smooth muscle cells. b Model of non-autonomous signaling
  between the mesoderm (bottom, blue) and NCCs (top, gray) highlighting FGF, WNT,
  and additional signaling from the mesoderm to NCCs in normal embryos (left) and
  how signaling is disrupted in the absence of Tbx1 (light blue arrows/inhibitory
  arrows; right). Alteration of signaling in the mesoderm in the absence of Tbx1 results
  in abnormal premature activation of the BMP pathway during NCC deployment and migration
  (light blue inhibitory arrow; red, up arrow), a decrease of MAPK signaling in NCCs
  (light blue arrow; red down arrow), and alteration of other signaling pathways including
  upregulation of WNT signaling in developing NCCs. This leads to failure of cardiac
  fate progression with a reduced number of CP-CNCCs, reduced number of CNCCs, and
  reduced number of SM-CNCCs (gray arrows) with aortic arch/branching defects and
  failed OFT septation (persistent truncus arteriosus).
