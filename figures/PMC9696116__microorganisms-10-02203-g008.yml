caption: L reuteri MJM60668 decreases FAS and SREBP and increases PPARα expression
  in liver at protein level. (a) protein expression of FAS in mice liver, (b) protein
  expression of SREBP in mice liver. (c) protein expression of PPARα in mice liver.
  (d) Images for western blot band. Data represented as mean ± S.E.M of three independent
  experiments. n = 4. ns = non-significant differences * p < 0.05 compared with HFD
  group, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001 compared with HFD group.
