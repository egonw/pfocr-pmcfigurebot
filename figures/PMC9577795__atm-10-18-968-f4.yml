caption: The top 10 upregulated DELs and their co-expressed DEGs. (A) Expression of
  the top 10 upregulated DELs in our microarray data set. (B) The lncRNA-mRNA co-expression
  network. The DEGs with absolute value of Spearmanâ€™s correlation coefficients >0.9
  and a P value <0.05 were considered the co-expressed DEGs of the top 10 upregulated
  DELs. ***, P<0.001. DEG, differentially expressed gene; DEL, differentially expressed
  lncRNA.
