caption: Amyloid-β (Aβ) (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration (N) in relation to each
  other. (A) Baseline high tau positron emission tomography (PET) and low adjusted
  hippocampal volume (aHCV) were not associated with subsequent Aβ PET increase (ΔAb)
  in 121 participants with longitudinal Aβ PET data. (B) Baseline high Aβ PET but
  not low aHCV was associated with subsequent tau PET increase (Δ18F-flortaucipir
  [ΔFTP]) in 185 participants with longitudinal tau PET data. (C) Baseline high tau
  PET but not high Aβ PET was associated with subsequent aHCV decrease (ΔaHCV) in
  218 participants with longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging data. The error bars
  indicate 95% confidence interval of the estimated β coefficient. aHCV*FTP, Aβ*aHCV,
  and Aβ*FTP indicate the interaction between aHCV and FTP, Aβ and aHCV, and Aβ and
  FTP, respectively. **p < .01; ***p < .001.
