caption: '(A), a picture of the isolated yak primary AMs (400×); (B), the ratio of
  the viability of AMs treated with varying concentrations of BHB for 12 or 24 h to
  that in the control group (n = 3). In (B), data were expressed as the mean ± standard
  deviation. One-way ANOVA was used to analyze the differences among groups. * 0.01
  < p < 0.05 for AMs treated for 12 h; ** 0.001 < p < 0.01 for AMs treated for 12
  h; ## 0.001 < p < 0.01 for AMs treated for 24 h.'
