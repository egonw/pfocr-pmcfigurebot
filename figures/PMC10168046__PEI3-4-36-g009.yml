caption: Metabolic network diagram of differentially abundant metabolites (DAMs) in
  fls2_NaCl and WT_NaCl samples. (a) Metabolic network diagram of DAMs in the comparison
  between fls2_NaCl and WT_NaCl samples. Solid lines indicate one‐step reactions;
  dashed lines indicate two‐ or more‐step reactions. (b) Impact of DAMs in fls2_NaCl
  versus WT_NaCl comparisons on different metabolic pathways. All matching pathways
  for metabolites are shown based on p‐values from pathway enrichment analysis and
  pathway impact values are derived from pathway topology analysis. The color of the
  circle is based on the p‐values, from light to dark, and the p‐value from large
  to small. The radius of the circle is based on its pathway impact value, from small
  to large, and the impact value from small to large. The pathway impact value is
  the ratio of the sum of the importance measures of each matched metabolite to the
  importance measures of all metabolites in each pathway.
