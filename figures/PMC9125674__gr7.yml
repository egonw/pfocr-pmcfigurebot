caption: 'Effects of L-arginine (L-Arg, 400 μM) on protein synthesis rate, phosphorylation
  of mTOR and protein S6 kinase beta-1 (p70S6K), and the protein levels of atrogin-1
  and muscle RING finger 1 (MuRF1) in myoblasts from chicken embryo pectoralis major
  (PM) and biceps femoris (BF) muscles. Myoblasts from PM: (A) nitrite (NO2−) concentrations;
  (B) inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and total nitric oxide synthase (TNOS)
  activities; (C) protein synthesis rate; (D) total and phosphorylated mTOR; (E) total
  and phosphorylated p70S6K; (F) atrogin-1; (G) MuRF1. Myoblasts from BF: (H) NO2−
  concentrations; (I) iNOS and TNOS activities; (J) protein synthesis rate; (K) total
  and phosphorylated mTOR; (L) total and phosphorylated p70S6K; (M) atrogin-1; (N)
  MuRF1. The data were presented as the mean ± SD (n = 6); ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01.'
