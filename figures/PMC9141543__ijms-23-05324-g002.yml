caption: Differentially regulated metabolic pathways and metabolites in plasma exosomes
  of patients with pCR or RD after NAC. (A) Scatter plot showing metabolic pathways
  upregulated (maroon plots with positive NES) and downregulated (green plots with
  negative NES) in RD vs. pCR (analyzed using GSEA). The color intensity indicates
  the p-value, and the dot size indicates NES. (B) Scatter plot summarizing the pathways
  differentially enriched in patients with RD vs. patients with pCR after NAC; circles
  indicate matched pathways from user-uploaded data. The color intensity indicates
  the p-value, and the dot size indicates the enrichment score. (C) Network analysis
  showing metabolites in differentially regulated pathways in RD and pCR samples.
  Colors indicate different metabolic pathways, and circles indicate metabolites associated
  with a specific pathway. (D) Scatter plot showing the most important metabolites
  of a selected model ranked from most to least important (analyzed using biomarker
  analysis). (E) Venn diagram showing shared and differentially regulated metabolites
  identified by GSEA and biomarker analysis. Different shapes were used to differentiate
  the results of the two analyses. Colors are specific to metabolites that were differentially
  regulated in the two groups. NES, normalized enrichment score. This schematic was
  created using BioRender (Toronto, ON, Canada).
