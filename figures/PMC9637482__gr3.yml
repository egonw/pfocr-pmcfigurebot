caption: 'CSE and B[α]P increased levels of JAK2/STAT3 pathway expression and induced
  increases OPN expression and MSC recruitment in human lung cancer cells. (A) A Gene
  Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)-based pathway analysis included RAS, ERK, EGF and
  p38 MAPK gene sets associated with lung cancer in smokers and nonsmokers obtained
  from the BioCarta database. (B) Western blot analysis examined levels of MAPK (ERK,
  JNK, p38), H-Ras, β-actin, JAK2 and STAT3 phosphorylation in A549-L cells. The graphs
  demonstrate densitometric analysis of p-p38/p38, p-ERK/ERK, p-JNK/JNK, H-Ras/β-actin,
  p-JAK2/JAK2 and p-STAT3/STAT3. (C) A549-L cells were incubated with a JAK2 inhibitor
  for 24 h. Western blot examined levels of STAT3 phosphorylation. A549-L cells were
  incubated with JAK2/STAT3 inhibitors or JAK2/STAT3 siRNAs for 24 h. Densitometric
  analysis of protein expression was normalized to β-actin. (D-G) Levels of OPN expression
  were examined by qRT-PCR and ELISA assays. (H) The Transwell assay examined MSC
  recruitment in CM collected from A549-L cells after 24 h of incubation. (I) The
  adhesion assay examined levels of MSC adhesion with A549-L cells after 24 h of incubation.
  All results are expressed as the mean ± SD of three independent samples. *p < 0.05
  compared with levels of the parental group; #p < 0.05 compared with 1 μM B[α]P or
  1% CSE treatment.'
