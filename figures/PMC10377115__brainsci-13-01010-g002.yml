caption: 'This figure depicts the brain regions that secrete CRH. While the hypothalamus
  is the primary source of CRH, other brain areas also secrete this hormone. CRH binds
  to its BLA, CRHR1, and CRHR2 receptors in the central amygdala, modulating stress-emotional
  memories and anxiety. Additionally, CRH is involved in terminating stress-related
  anxiety. In the locus coeruleus, CRH binds to CRHR1 and interacts with the noradrenaline
  pathway. In the hippocampus, CRH released by interneurons binds to pyramidal cells
  CRHR1, affecting stress-related learning and memory. The BnST releases CRH, which
  modulates stress-related anxiety via CRHR1 located in the nucleus accumbens and
  CRHR2. Understanding the distribution of CRH and its receptors throughout the brain
  provides insight into the complex role of this hormone in stress-related behaviors.
  CRH is a critical component of the HPA axis and plays a crucial role in the body’s
  response to stress. CRH: corticotropin-releasing hormone, CRHR: corticotropin-releasing
  hormone receptor. HPA: hypo-thalamic–pituitary–adrenal; CeA: central amygdala; BLA:
  basolateral amygdala; BnST: bed nucleus of the stria terminalis.'
