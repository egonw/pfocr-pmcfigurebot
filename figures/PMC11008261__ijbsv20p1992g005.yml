caption: 'TREM2 regulates chondrocyte function through the NF-κB/CXCL3 axis. A, BAY
  11-7082 is used to inhibit NF-κB signaling pathway activation. TREM2-KO bone marrow
  macrophages were isolated and pretreated with LPS/IFN-γ and/or BAY 11-7082 before
  co-culturing them with chondrocytes. Flow cytometry was used to detect chondrocyte
  apoptosis. B, Detection of the ROS content in the co-culture medium of macrophages
  and chondrocytes in each group. C, TB staining was performed on various groups of
  chondrocytes. D, The protein content of CXCL3 in each group and proteins associated
  with maintenance and degradation of cartilage extracellular matrix were measured.
  The statistical graph on the right depicts the relative protein content. ***P <
  0.001, compared to the control group, ###P < 0.001, compared to the BAY 11-7082
  group. E, Cell proliferation of each group was assessed by EdU. F, Western blotting
  is used to detect NF-κB (p65) phosphorylation levels in different groups of macrophages.
  G, The transfection of small interfering RNA (si-CXCL3) was used to decrease CXCL3
  expression in TREM2-KO macrophages. LPS/IFN-γ pretreated normal or low CXCL3-expressing
  TREM2-KO macrophages were used and co-cultivated with chondrocytes. Flow cytometry
  was used to detect chondrocyte apoptosis in each group. H, Detection of the ROS
  content in the co-culture medium of macrophages and chondrocytes in each group.
  I, Cell proliferation of each group was assessed by EdU.'
