caption: LETM2 accelerates PDAC malignant progression by activating the PI3K-Akt pathway
  in vivo. (A) Temporal scheme of in vivo experiments. (B) Gross images of PDAC subcutaneous
  tumor. (C) The tumors were extracted and weighed after 4 weeks. (D) The tumor volume
  was monitored every five days, and tumor growth curves were generated. (E) H&E and
  IHC staining with an antibody specific for Ki67 in sections of tumors. The data
  shown were representative of three experiments. Scale bars, 200 μm. Student’s t-test
  was performed. ns, not significant; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001.
