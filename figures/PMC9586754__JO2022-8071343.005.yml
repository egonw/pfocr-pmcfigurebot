caption: To verify how the regulatory effect of ZFP57 on the WNT pathway affected
  radiosensitivity of PCC, ZFP57 overexpression was induced in BxPC3-RR cells with
  or without the incubation of SKL2001, followed by radiotherapy. (a) Survival fraction
  of the BxPC3-RR cells. (b) Cell viability. (c) Expressions of CDK4 and cyclin D1
  (related to cell cycle), Bax and Bcl-2 (proteins related to apoptosis), cleaved
  caspase-3 (a protein related to DNA repair γ-H2AX), and proteins involved in the
  WNT pathway (d) β-catenin and c-Myc. ∗∗P < 0.01 and ∗P < 0.05.

  by Targeting ZFP57 and Activating the Wnt Pathway.
