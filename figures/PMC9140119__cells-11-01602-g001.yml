caption: RNAi knockdown of candidate genes in the MAPK signaling pathway in female
  C. bowringi. (A) The pathway diagram shows 14 candidate genes from ERK, JNK, and
  P38 pathways in the MAPK signaling pathway. (B) Ovary phenotypes of C. bowringi
  at 0, I, II, III, and IV development grades. Grade 0, the ovary is white and transparent,
  and the ovariole presents silk thread shape; Grade I, the ovariole is obviously
  tubular, and the yolk deposition begins; Grade II, yolk gradually deposited and
  ovary gradually expanded; Grade III, a small amount of mature eggs have appeared,
  and there are no eggs in the lateral oviduct; Grade IV, the ovariole is full of
  mature eggs, and mature eggs can also be seen in the lateral oviduct. (C) The development
  grades of candidate genes knocked down at 4-day PE (n = 23â€“37). Genes marked with
  red triangles significantly inhibited ovarian development.
