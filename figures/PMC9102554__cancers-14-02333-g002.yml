caption: Hypothetical role of sensory nerve fibers in the cancer immune response based
  on published data. Cancer cells go through immune editing and become more aggressive,
  while nerve fibers and Schwann cells go through cancer cell editing and become tumorigenic.
  Free sensory nerve endings of visceral and peripheral tissues are the first to sense
  the danger signals from pathogens and abnormal cells, inducing an acute inflammatory
  response as well as the compensatory anti-inflammatory pathway through the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal
  axis in the early stage. In the intermediate stage, partly functioning nerve fibers
  provide local anti-inflammatory-response cytokines/chemokines released by activated
  Schwann cells, enhancing cytotoxic immunity. In the advanced stage, complete degeneration
  of nerve fibers followed by formation of abnormal nerve fibers and tumorigenic Schwann
  cell activation markedly enhances chronic inflammation, and MDSCs impair cytotoxic
  immunity and induce metastasis.
