caption: 'TRPM8 does not affect MMP secretion but modulates Rho GTPase signaling pathway.
  (A,B) MMP–9 (A) and MMP–2 (B) secretion in PC3 luc and PC3–M8 luc treated with WS12
  (10 nM), empty LNCs, or LNC–WS12s (10 nM); data are expressed as means ± SEM of
  six independent experiments (statistical significance: ordinary one–way ANOVA with
  post hoc Tukey’s test); (C–E) Activation of Cdc42 (C), Rac1 (D), and RhoA (E) in
  PC3 luc and PC3–M8 luc treated with WS12 (10 nM), empty LNCs, or LNC–WS12s (10 nM).
  Data are normalized to the CTRL (PC3 luc) and expressed as means ± SEM of five independent
  experiments for each condition (statistical significance: * = p <0.05, ** = p <0.01,
  ordinary one–way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey’s test).'
