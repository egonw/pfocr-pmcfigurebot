caption: Establishment of a unique co-culture model of Notch3 activation-sensor expressing
  tumor cells (SNFT) and differentially expressing Jagged-1 fibroblasts (NIH3T3jag−1).
  (A,B) Temporal kinetics of Notch3 sensor activity in SNFT in co-culture with NIH3T3J1-A
  cells showed an initial activation after 12 h of 18.9-fold (p < 0.01), which reaches
  its maxima at 24 h (22.3-fold, p < 0.001) and subsequently dropped by 48 h (14.8-fold,
  p < 0.001) (n = 3). (C,D) Bioluminescence images of co-culture between SNFT and
  different Jag1 clones of NIH3T3 (C) show a linearly proportional relationship between
  Jagged1 expression and Notch3 promoter activity as represented graphically in (D)
  (n = 3 for each clone). (E,F) Dose-inhibition kinetics are represented by the live-cell
  images (E) and graphically (F), which shows that concentration between 50 µM to
  75 µM of DAPT results in a significant reduction in the NIH3T3J1-A mediated Notch3
  activity in SNFT (n = 3). All three real-time live-cell imaging experiments were
  independently performed and represented by respective scale bars. (G,H) Immunoblot
  of sorted SNFT cells post-co-culture and graphical analysis show increased release
  of NICD3 in SNFT when co-cultured with NIH3T3wt (not significantly) and with NIH3T3J1-A
  (~3-fold, p ≤ 0.01) (n = 2) (also see ). * p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤ 0.001.
