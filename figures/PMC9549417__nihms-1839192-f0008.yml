figure_title: Nuclear cAMP- and YAP-dependent signaling are inversely correlated in
  human melanoma
caption: (A) Heatmaps comparing the relative upregulation and downregulation of genes
  in hyperactive YAP-expressing MeWo cells (rows) versus NLS-sAC-expressing (columns)
  in vivo mouse melanoma tumors (left panel) and in vitro mouse melanoma cell lines
  (right panel). The number of genes observed in each quadrant is indicated.(B) Spearman
  correlation between inferred NLS-sAC and YAP activities across 45 melanoma cell
  lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE). Three approaches were used
  to derive the activity signatures, sigs. 1–3 (see ,  section).(C) Heatmap showing
  Z score-transformed mRNA expression values for melanocytic and neural crest differentiation
  signature genes (motif 1) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)-like signal
  signature genes (motif 2), defined by , in 45 melanoma cell lines (columns). Inferred
  NLS-sAC and YAP activities in each cell line are indicated at the top.
