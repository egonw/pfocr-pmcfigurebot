caption: Network construction and GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. (a) Common targets
  between GJ and osteoarthritis. (b) GJ-target-OA network. The GJ-target-OA network
  was constructed by linking potential compounds of GJ to their putative targets.
  The polychromatic hexagons represented potential compounds (A1-G1 were common compounds
  among different herbs) and the blue diamonds indicated the targets. (c) PPI network
  of 134 common targets (d) and 8 hub targets. (e) GO enrichment analysis of 134 common
  targets. (f) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of top 20 pathways. The red box indicates
  that TNF signaling pathway is in the top 10.
