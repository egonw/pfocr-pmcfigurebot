caption: 'Nuclear TCF4 modulates CD44v6 transcription in resistant cells, and the
  ICD domain of CD44v6 is required for oxaliplatin (a component of FOLFOX) efflux.
  (A-D), CD44v6 was transcriptionally regulated by TCF4 in SW480-FR cells. (A), The
  sketch maps of predicted TCF4 binding sites (CTTTGA) within the CD44v6 luciferase
  promoter (A), and CD44v6 (B) are shown in SW480-FR CICs. (B), CD44v6 luciferase
  (Luc) activity reporter assays are shown for SW480-FR cells CICs overexpressing
  dominant negative (DN) TCF4, or β-catenin shRNA, or NT-shRNA (control). (C, D).
  (C) The sketch map shows the predicted TCF4 binding sites (CTTTGA) within the indicated
  CD44 promoter. The transcriptional start site was at +1, and ATG is at the translation
  start site. The putative TCF4 binding sites (CD44v6 [A], CD44v6 [B]) are shown,
  and their locations are labeled by blue arrows. (D) Semiquantitative PCR products
  using ChIP PCR primers for the designated TCF4 binding sites on CD44v6 (A) and CD44v6
  (B), were amplified in SW480-FR CICs. (E), ChIP-qPCR using PCR primers for designated
  CD44v6 (A) sites (as shown in the schematic diagram in (C)) were used for amplification
  of the CD44v6 mRNA of untreated SW480-FR CICs cells and of CICs overexpressing the
  indicated vector and TCF4-DN cDNA. (F) Proposed model is shown for a positive feedback
  loop coupling β-catenin/TCF4 activation and CD44v6 alternate splicing that sustains
  cancer initiating cell proliferation and FOLFOX resistance. Left panel: In FOLFOX-resistant
  cells, in the absence pf DAB2, elevated WNT3A induces CD44v6 that recruits LRP6
  to caveolin-micro domain through its nuclear localization site (NLS). The CD44v6-lRP6
  complex is internalized through the caveolin-mediated endocytosis followed by endosomal
  sorting, resulting in accumulation of a TCF4-CD44v6 complex that causes transcriptional
  activation and the expression of its target genes including CD44v6 and MDR1 genes.
  Our results are the first demonstration of a positive feedback loop linking FOLFOX
  mediated increased WNT3A signaling-dependent alternative splicing of CD44 which
  is important for cell cycle progression resulting in FOLFOX-resistance in CRC-CICs
  in the absence of DAB2. Right panel: In sensitive cells in the presence of DAB2,
  the CD44v6-LRP6 complex is internalized through the clathrin-mediated endocytosis
  pathway and promotes β-catenin destruction and fails to recruit the β-catenin/TCF4-CD44v6
  complex into the nucleus. Data in B, E represent at least 3 independent experiments
  performed in triplicates. Values represent means ± SD.; n = 3–5; Semi-quantitative
  PCR data in “D” are representative of three experiments. (B), *P < 0.05 was considered
  significant, Luciferase activity of TCF4 DN. and β-catenin sh1 transfectant of SW480-FR
  cells for all the PGL3-CD44v6 (A), and PGL3-CD44v6 (B) constructs were compared
  with that of vector control. (E), *P < 0.05 was considered significant, ChIP PCR
  data for CD44v6 (A) sites of TCF4. and β-catenin antibody data were compared with
  that of IgG control in SW480-FR cells.'
