caption: Effect of bta-miR-199a-3p on LPS-induced apoptosis gene expression in MAC-T
  cells. (A,B) After transfection with the bta-miR-199a-3p mimic or inhibitor, the
  mRNA expression levels of CASP3 and CASP9 in the LPS-treated MAC-T cells were detected
  using qRT-PCR. The GAPDH and RPS18 genes were used as the internal controls. * refers
  to p < 0.05, ** refers to p < 0.01.
