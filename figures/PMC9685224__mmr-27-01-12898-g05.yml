caption: 'In vivo effects of UA and DOX on a HCT116 ×enograft mouse model. A xenograft
  mouse model was established on day 0 and was treated with DMSO, UA, DOX or UA +
  DOX on days 6–22. On day 22, all mice were sacrificed and samples were harvested.
  (A) ALT, (B) AST, (C) BUN and (D) creatinine levels were assessed. (E) Body weight
  was assessed in tumor-bearing mice following treatment. (F) Final tumor weight and
  (G) representative tumor images were obtained at the end of the experiment. (H)
  The tumor volume was monitored every two days. (I) Tumor sections were stained using
  H&E and Ki-67 for immunohistochemistry analysis. (J) Western blotting was performed
  to assess the expression levels of Akt signaling-associated proteins in tumor tissue.
  (K) Western blotting was performed to assess the expression levels of Hippo signaling-associated
  proteins in tumor tissue. (L) The expression levels of Akt and Hippo signaling-associated
  proteins were semi-quantified using ImageJ. GAPDH was used as the internal control.
