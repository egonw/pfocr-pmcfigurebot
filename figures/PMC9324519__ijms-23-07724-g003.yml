caption: (A) Pathway activation strength for pathways related to cell cycle progression
  and DNA stability. Pathways were clustered using Ward’s clustering method. (B) Relative
  mRNA levels for cell cycle regulators measured by real-time PCR three and six days
  after lentiviral shRNA transduction of SH-SY5Y cells. Each gene expression for each
  sample was normalized to GAPDH expression. (C) Cell cycle phase distribution for
  SH-SY5Y three and six days after transduction measured by flow cytometry using SYTOX-blue
  DNA staining. Percentages calculated with ModFit LT 5.0 are provided for G0/G1,
  S, and G2-M phases. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 as determined by two-tailed
  t-test for PCR experiments, and by Mann–Whitney test for other experiments.
