caption: Expression levels of StSROs in roots, stems, and leaves under different periods
  of heavy metal stress (6/12/24 h), the final data were the average of three biological
  replicates (Â±SD). The vertical lines on the bar chart indicate the standard deviation,
  as detailed in  (* p < 0.05 significant difference at the 0.05 level, ** p < 0.01
  difference extremely significant at the 0.01 level).
