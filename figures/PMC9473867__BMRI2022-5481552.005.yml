caption: 'Alleviating ability of hirudin on the renal fibrosis of rat. (a) HE staining
  and Masson staining. Scale bar: 50 μm. (b) Scoring on renal tubule injury condition.
  (c) Fibrotic area on fibrosis condition. (d) Evaluation on Scr content. (e) Western
  blot detection to reveal the expressions of fibronectin, collagen III, and α-SMA.
  (f) Semiquantitative analysis was performed based on the gray value. GAPDH was used
  for the endogenous protein. ##compared with UUO, P < 0.01.'
