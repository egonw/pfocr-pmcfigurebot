caption: Enzyme level changes in myocardial mitochondria during chronic HF promote
  heme synthesis and ketolysis, and down-regulate the incorporation of succinyl-CoA
  into the TCA cycle. (A–C) Succinyl-CoA metabolism in the TCA cycle (A) and relative
  protein levels of Ogdh (B) (n = 5) and Glud1 (C) (n = 10). (D–F) Propionyl-CoA-based
  succinyl-CoA synthesis in the mitochondrion (A) and relative protein levels of Pcca
  (E) (n = 10) and Mcm (F) (n = 10). (G) Relative protein levels of the succinyl-CoA
  synthetase subunits Sucla2 (Left, n = 6), Suclg1 (Middle, n = 6), and Suclg2 (Right,
  n = 6). (H–J) Heme synthesis pathway in the mitochondrion (H) and relative protein
  levels of Alas1 (I) (n = 6) and relative amounts of heme (J) (n = 6). CP, coproporphyrinogen-III;
  PPIX, protoporphyrin IX. (K–N) Ketolytic pathway in the mitochondrion (K), relative
  amounts of β-OHB in plasma (L) (n = 12), and relative levels of Oxct1 in mitochondria
  (M) (n = 6). All assays were performed using isolated myocardial mitochondria, except
  for (L) (blood plasma). In (B), (C), (E–G), (I), and (M), representative results
  of each immunoblot blot are shown in the upper panels. Each data point in the dot
  plot represents one individual mouse sample. Significances between groups were tested
  using the unpaired t test, and are indicated by asterisks (*P < 0.05). Full-size
  CBB staining scans of the immunoblots are shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S6.
