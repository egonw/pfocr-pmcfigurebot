caption: OA-RD17 suppressed inflammatory factor expression and activated the MAPK
  signaling pathway to promote keratinocyte proliferation and migration. A, B ELISA
  analysis of effects of OA-RD17 on inflammatory factors (IL-6 and TNF-α) release
  in keratinocytes after LPS stimulation. C Representative image of MAPK signaling
  pathway activation in keratinocytes after 24 h of OA-RD17 treatment, determined
  by western blotting. D Quantification of P38, ERK, and JNK protein phosphorylation.
  E–G RT-qPCR analysis of Ki67, CDK2, and Cyclin A1 mRNA expression in OA-RD17-treated
  keratinocytes. H Changes in pro-proliferation activity of OA-RD17 in keratinocytes
  after application of MAPK signaling pathway inhibitors. I Representative images
  of effects of OA-RD17 on keratinocyte scratch repair after application of MAPK signaling
  pathway inhibitors. J Quantification of effects of OA-RD17 on keratinocyte scratch
  repair rate after application of MAPK signaling pathway inhibitors. All data are
  expressed as mean ± SEM from three independent experiments, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001
