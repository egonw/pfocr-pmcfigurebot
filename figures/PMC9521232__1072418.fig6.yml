caption: Transcriptome subtypes and overall survival. (A) Heatmap of gene expression
  used for clustering analysis is shown with color code for clinical information (clinical
  response to mogamulizumab, clinical subtype, sample type) and heatmap for tumor
  contents in the sample. Consensus clustering identified four transcriptional subtypes
  (A, B, C and D) in the cohort. Representative gene ontology annotations, identified
  by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, for gene modules are shown on the right. (B) Overall
  survival (OS) of all adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) patients enrolled in the
  study, stratified according to transcriptional subgroups. (C) OS of all ATL patients
  in transcriptional subgroup D compared to pooled TS-A, -B, and -C groups.
