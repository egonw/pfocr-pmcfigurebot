caption: Expression of Cited1 is STAT1-dependent. (A) Diagram of the IFNγ-STAT1 signaling
  pathway. The relationship under investigation is demarcated by a question mark.
  (B) Putative STAT1 and IRF1 transcription factor binding sites were detected in
  the murine Cited1 promoter using EPD and a P-value cutoff of ≤0.001. (C) Western
  blot analysis for STAT1 proteins in two independent clonal RAW264.7 cell lines stably
  transduced with lentiviral constructs to express Cas9 and either non-targeting (scramble)
  or Stat1-targeting gRNA. (D–G) RAW264.7 STAT1 knockout (KO) cells and scramble controls
  were stimulated with IFNγ for 48 h. Expression of (D) Isg20 and (E) Ifit1 was measured
  by qRT-PCR. (F) STAT1, IRF1 and CITED1 proteins were detected by western blotting,
  and (G) Cited1 expression was measured by qRT-PCR. Error is represented as s.e.m.
  (n=3). A representative experiment out of three repeats is shown for C and F. *P<0.05;
  **P<0.01; ****P<0.0001 (one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey's multiple comparison
  test).
