caption: Site of complement activation within the renal tubulointerstitium. A Normal
  complement activation and regulatory control. Complement activation through any
  inciting pathway activates the conversion of the fluid-phase C3 into C3a and C3b.
  C3b deposits on the renal tubular epithelial cell in a process normally controlled
  by factor H and cell surface complement regulatory proteins (CRPs). B Complement
  activation in the setting of tubular epithelial cell injury. Stressed or injured
  tubular epithelial cells increase expression of L-fucose on the cell surface. Collectin-11
  (CL-11) functions as a pattern recognition molecule within the mannose-binding lectin
  pathway. CL-11 binds to L-fucose. CL-11/L-fucose/MASP complexes then promote complement
  activation via cleavage of C3. C Expression of cell-surface regulatory proteins
  (CRPs) is disrupted after tubular epithelial cell injury. In this situation, C3b
  and the C3 convertase are no longer efficiently inactivated, and activation proceeds
