caption: 'Effect of PTX on HIF-1α/VEGF signaling pathway in ALI induced by chlorine.
  A The protein expression levels were determined by western blot analysis. B Densitometric
  analyses of protein expression levels corresponding to (A). * P < 0.05 compared
  with the normal group. #P < 0.05 compared with chlorine-treated group. NC: normal
  control; PTX: pentoxifylline; HIF-1α: Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1α'
