caption: Cyto-ID staining to detect the relative number of autophagic vacuoles in
  Ca Ski cells. Cells were treated with Nigrosporins B (0, 2.5, 5, 10 µM) for 18 h.
  After staining with Cyto-ID Green Detection Reagent, analyzed by flow cytometry.
  Results are presented as histogram overlay. Tube_001 to Tube_005 in table represent
  the mean fluorescence intensity of unstained (background fluorescence intensity),
  normal cells and cells treated with Nigrosporins B (2.5, 5, 10 µM).(*** means not
  detected).

  and Protective Autophagy in Human Cervical Cancer Ca Ski Cells Mediated by PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  Signaling Pathway.
