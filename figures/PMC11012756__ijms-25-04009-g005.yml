caption: Proteins expressed by the most commonly mutated genes in HPV-associated head
  and neck cancer (HNC) and their intersecting pathways. These mutated genes include
  TP53, PIK3CA, PTEN, NOTCH1, RB1, FAT1, FBXW7, HRAS, KRAS, and CDKN2A. The genes
  and proteins in blue are intersecting genes in the HPV-associated HNC pathway. The
  drugs currently available, or in development, to target these mutations are listed
  below with their respective genes/proteins. Some common drugs include HSP90 inhibitors,
  BRAF/MEK inhibitors, CDK4/6 inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, and Wee1
  inhibitors. Different colored font was added to indicate that certain treatments
  can target multiple genes and pathways.
