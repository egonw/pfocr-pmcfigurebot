caption: ITGA10 was dysregulated in OP (A) KEGG analysis of the pathway related to
  the differential genes. (B)The downregulation of ITGA10 in osteoporosis (n = 5)
  compared with the control (n = 5). (C) 30 common miRNAs were screened out by TargetScan
  and GEO dataset (GSE93883). GSE93883 was obtained from NCBI. (D) The upregulation
  of miR-4739 in osteoporosis (n = 12) compared with the control (n = 6).
