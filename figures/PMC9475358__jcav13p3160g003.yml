caption: The chemokine CXCL12 is engaged by two different receptors, CXCR4 and CXCR7.
  CXCR4 downstream signaling regulates gene transcription, chemotaxis, cell survival,
  and proliferation. The signaling pathways activated upon CXCL12 binding to CXCR4
  and subsequent recruitment of G proteins include PI3K-AKT, NF-κB and MAPK, whereas
  the JAK/STAT signaling pathway is recruited in a G-protein-independent manner. All
  these pathways support malignancy and stemness features. Unlike typical GPCRs, CXCR7
  is generally not coupled to G proteins. This receptor can activate MAPK effectors
  via β-arrestin, whereas in some cell types it can form heterodimers with CXCR4 and
  act as a co-receptor. Additionally, CXCR7 has been proposed to scavenge excess CXCL12
  through high-affinity binding and degradation, thus modulating ligand binding to
  CXCR4. Created with Biorender.com.
