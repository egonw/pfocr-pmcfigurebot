caption: Pirh2‐p53 signalling pathway is essential for NAA10 medicated OSCC invasion
  and metastasis. (A and B) Transwell assays were used to evaluate whether Pirh2 knockdown
  blocked the promoting effects of silencing NAA10 on the migration (A) and invasion
  (B) of CAL 27 cells. Values are presented as the means ± SD of three independent
  experiments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01
article_title: N‐α‐Acetyltransferase 10 inhibits invasion and metastasis of oral squamous
  cell carcinoma via regulating Pirh2‐p53 signalling pathway.
