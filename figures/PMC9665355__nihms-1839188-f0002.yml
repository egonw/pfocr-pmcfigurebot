figure_title: Impad1 is a direct target of the epithelial miRNAs miR-200 and miR~96
caption: '(A–D) Impad1 mRNA (top) and protein (bottom) expression upon miR-200 (A)
  or miR~96-induced (B) MET in 344SQ cells, Zeb1-induced EMT in 393P cells (C), and
  miR-200-induced MET in human mesenchymal lung cancer cells (H157; D) (doxycycline:
  2 μM, 96 h).(E) IHC staining and quantification for the percentage of Impad1+ cells
  in GEMM lung tumors (KRAS versus KM200). n = 27 (9 images/tumor). Scale bars, 20
  μm). (F and G) Correlation of Impad1 with miR-200b (F; Spearman rho, −0.358; p =
  0.0281) or miR-96 (G; Spearman rho, −0.331; p = 0.0432) in human NSCLC cell lines.(H
  and I) Schematic of the wild-type or mutant miRNA target sites in the Impad1 3’
  UTR (top). Shown is normalized luciferase reporter activity upon co-expression of
  the mouse control miRNA mimic or mimics for miR-200b and miR-200c (H) or mimics
  for miR-96 and miR-183 (I) in 393P wild-type (WT) cells. 60 pmol mimic concentration
  was used.See also . Data are represented as mean ± SD. Significance by Student’s
  t test. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.002.'
