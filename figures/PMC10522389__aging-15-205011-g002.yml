caption: 'The effects of VZV infection on the risk of stroke according to follow-up
  time. OR indicates odds ratio, 95% CI indicates 95% confidence interval, and %Weight
  indicates the weight of each study. The vertical line in the middle represents the
  null effect line (OR = 1), indicating no statistical association between the studied
  factor and the outcome. Each horizontal line represents the 95% CI of each study.
  If the horizontal line of a certain study does not intersect with the null effect
  line (i.e., the 95% CI does not cross 0), it can be considered that there is a statistical
  association between the studied factor and the outcome. Abbreviations: yr: represents
  a year; wk: represents a week.'
