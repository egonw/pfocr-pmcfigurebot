caption: 'The purine metabolic pathway of Plasmodium falciparum. (A) The purine metabolic
  pathway relies on salvaged nucleosides and nucleobases imported from the bloodstream
  of the host. First, these metabolites are transported through the erythrocyte equilibrative
  nucleoside transporters (HsENT), which are then passed into the parasitophorous
  vacuole through the high-throughput parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) channel.
  The nucleosides are then being transferred into the parasite cytoplasm through the
  PfENTs. The nucleosides and nucleobases available are as follows: adenosine, inosine,
  guanosine, hypoxanthine, xanthine. Firstly, the N-glycosidic bonds of nucleosides
  are cleaved by the purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) enzyme to generate their
  respective nucleobases. Furthermore, adenosine is first deaminated into inosine
  by the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA). The generated nucleobases are hypoxanthine,
  xanthine and guanosine that all intertwine in different paths. Most notably, hypoxanthine
  both can be turned into adenosine- (AMP) and guanosine-5′-monophosphate (GMP). For
  this, first the hypoxanthine is first transferred onto a phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate
  (PRPP) by the broad-specific hypoxanthine–guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyl transferase
  (HGXPRT) to generate inosine-5′-monophosphate (IMP). The IMP can be turned into
  xanthine-5′-monophosphate (XMP) by the IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH) enzyme or through
  two consecutive reactions by adenylosuccinate synthase (ADSS) and lyase (ADSL),
  it can be converted to AMP. Furthermore, xanthine and guanine can also be transferred
  onto a PRPP by HGXPRT to generate XMP and guanosine-5′-monophosphate (GMP), respectively.
  XMP is also used to generate GMP through GMP synthase (GMPS). Finally, in several
  consecutive steps AMP and GMP can be turned into deoxy-ATP (dATP) and deoxy-GMP
  (dGMP) after oxidation by ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) and phosphorylation by
  nucleoside kinase (NK) and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK). Dashed lines indicate
  consecutive enzymatic steps. (B) Transcriptomic analysis of the enzymes in the purine
  metabolic pathway. Transcriptomic data has been gathered from the database generated
  by Toenhake et al. and reorganized in an orderly manner. Values are shown in fragments
  per kilobase of exon per million mapped fragments (FPKM) as a measure of expression
  levels. Green, yellow and red background indicates the stages, which we considered
  to be ring, trophozoite and schizont stages in this study, respectively. The red
  dashed vertical line shows the peak expression of all purine metabolic enzymes.
  Note the break on the vertical axis noted by the grey dotted line.'
