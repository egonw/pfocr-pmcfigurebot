figure_title: SMAD4 phosphorylation at Ser367 by ERK regulates SMAD4 nuclear translocation
caption: (A) Expression levels of total SMAD4 and phosphorylated SMAD4 at Thr276 in
  naive and αCD3/CD28 activated CD8+ T cells (in the presence of DMSO control, PI3K
  inhibitor, ERK inhibitor, respectively). ERKi, ERK1/2 inhibitor; PI3Ki, PI3K inhibitor.
  (B) Three candidate serine/threonine phosphorylation sites (Ser367, Thr372, and
  Ser431) on SMAD4. Cell lysates from αCD3/CD28 activated CD8+ T cells were subjected
  to anti-SMAD4 purification via immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry
  analysis. (C) Immunofluorescence staining data of SMAD4 (red; Alexa Fluor 594) in
  naive or αCD3/CD28 activated CD8+ T cells infected with retrovirus harboring WT
  Smad4 or the three mutant Smad4 gene (24 hours after retrovirus infection). Statistic
  data of SMAD4 nuclear translocation ratio were determined by manually counting the
  percentage of cells containing higher SMAD4 staining intensity in the nucleus versus
  cytoplasm in three representative fields. (D) Co-overexpressed MEK1 and ERK2 phosphorylated
  SMAD4 at Ser367 site. FLAG-SMAD4-WT or FLAG-SMAD4-S367F and MEK1-ERK2 were cotransfected
  into HEK-293T cells. Immunoprecipitation by anti-FLAG and Western blotting were
  carried out. (E) Western blotting results of in vitro phosphorylation assay by using
  recombinant active ERK2. FLAG-SMAD4-WT and FLAG-SMAD4-S367F were immunoprecipitation-purified
  with anti-FLAG affinity gel, washed by 3× FLAG peptide. Phospho-serine (p-Ser) levels
  (relative to total SMAD4) were quantified by ImageJ software. These experiments
  were repeated two or three times with consistent results.
