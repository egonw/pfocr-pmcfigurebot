caption: Celecoxib exerts antitumor effect through Lnc_ AC006548.28-miR-223-LAMC2
  pathway. (a and c) After the treatment with celecoxib or KO Lnc_AC006548.28, OE-miR-223,
  and KO LAMC2 detected the tumor infiltration by HE staining. The difference was
  statistically significant. (b and d) Ki67 was used to detect the proliferation of
  cancer cells; the same results were those that suggest LAMC2 may regulate Lnc_AC006548.28
  by regulating miR-223 expression and affect the pathological progress of tumor.
  (e) Suitable primers were designed. (f) The expression of genes in different groups
  was detected by PCR test, the difference was statistically significant, and the
  expression of these genes had the role of mutual regulation.
