caption: Roles of EpCAM in cancer development and progression. a EpCAM on CSCs membrane
  surface was cleaved by ADAM17 and γ-secretase, generating EpICD. Most of the EpICD
  is degraded by proteasome, while the remaining EpICD can bind with FHL2, β-catenin
  and Lef-1, forming the trans-nuclear complex to activate proliferation and pluripotency
  related genes. b EpEX/EGFR pathway and EpICD trans-nuclear complex can promote cell
  proliferation. EGF and TGF-β pathway can regulate EMT markers and EpCAM expression.
  c In hypoxic condition, EpCAM is upregulated in ATP-high state, whereas in ATP-low
  situation, HIF-1α is upregulated. CAIX is overexpressed mediated by HIF-1α. CAIX+,
  together with higher EpCAM and K19 expression HCC subgroup exhibited with high resistance
  to chemoembolization. Additionally, N-glycosylated EpCAM can regulate HIF-1α and
  promote EMT and stemness related properties. d MHC-I/TCR interaction serves as T
  cell activation signals. While activated EpEX/EGFR/ERK pathway results in reduction
  of PD-L1 ubiquitination degradation. PD-L1 on tumor surface hampers activation of
  CD8+ T cells and leading to immune escape. CAIX carbonic anhydrase-IX, ECM extracellular
  matrix, FHL2 four and a half LIM domain protein 2, HIF-1α hypoxia inducible factor
