figure_title: PCDH1 activates the NF-κB pathway in PDAC cells
caption: A Representative heatmaps showing the differentially expressed genes (fold
  change > 2) after PCDH1 silencing by RNA interference in Panc-1 cells and the control
  group. The expression levels are shown as log2-transformed values. B GSEA of mRNA
  profiles revealed inhibited expression of NF-κB target genes after PCDH1 silencing
  by RNA interference in Panc-1 cells compared with the control group. C Quantitative
  RT–PCR showing that NF-κB regulated IL-6, IL-8 and TNFα mRNA expression in Panc-1
  cells with in PCDH1 silenced by RNA interference and the control group. D Dual-luciferase
  assays were performed to detect the effects of PCDH1 on the NF-κB signalling pathways
  in PDAC cell lines. Western blot assay (E) and immunofluorescence assays (F) were
  performed to detect the effect of PCDH1 on the nuclear localization of p65. For
  the PCDH1 silencing groups shown in Figs. 4D, 4E and 4F, TNF-α (20 ng/ml) (Sigma–Aldrich,
  GF314) pretreatment was performed for 10 min. The results are presented as the mean ± SD
  of three independent experiments. The data were assessed by Student’s 2-tailed t
  test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
