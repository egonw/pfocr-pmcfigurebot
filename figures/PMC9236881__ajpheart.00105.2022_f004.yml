caption: 'Changes in the cardiac proteome during pregnancy and postpartum period.
  Proteomics analyses from hearts extracted from nonpregnant, diestrus (NP), midpregnant
  (MP; day 8 of pregnancy), late pregnant (LP; day 16 of pregnancy), and 1 wk postbirth
  (PB) female mice (n = 5 per group). A: unsupervised analysis was performed and a
  heatmap generated showing the top 75 differentially expressed proteins in hearts
  from NP, MP, LP, and PB female mice. Red indicates increased abundance, and blue
  indicates reduced abundance. Intensity of color indicates increased significance.
  B: supervised analysis showing partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)
  highlighting group separation. C: the variable importance in projection plot (VIP)
  of the top 25 proteins contributing to the group separation observed in the PLS-DA
  plot. ANOVA analysis was performed to identify significantly expressed cardiac metabolite
  and protein abundances [P < 0.05; false discovery rate (FDR) 0.05] across all time
  points (NP, MP, LP, and PB). Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) and Uniprot IDs of
  those significantly expressed targets were added to the joint pathway analysis tool
  in Metaboanalyst 5.0., which corresponded to 493 changed metabolites and 350 changed
  proteins across all 4 time points. D and E: joint pathway analysis was performed
  with Fisherâ€™s exact test with degree centrality topology applied and these data
  integrated based on pathway level combined P values for all pathways (D) and metabolic
  pathways (E).'
