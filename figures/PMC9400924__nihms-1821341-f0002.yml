caption: '(A) The average pupil constriction over time in response to 100-lux light
  (73,000 R*/rod/s) beginning at t = 0 s for control (blue, n = 6), mGluR6 KO (orange,
  n = 9), and mGluR6; Opn4 dKO (dark red, n = 6) mice. Shaded outlines represent SEM.
  All pupil sizes are normalized to the dark-adapted pupil size (before t = 0).(B)
  The minimum normalized pupil area (maximal constriction) in response to 100-lux
  light from t = 0 to t = 30 s. Individuals are shown as circles. Error bars show
  SEM. Significance from the littermate control group is as follows: mGluR6 KO, p
  = 3E–5; mGluR6; Opn4 dKO, p = 3E–6 (ANOVA post hoc Dunnett’s method).(C) PLR delay
  seen in (A). mGluR6 KO mice (orange) have a pupil constriction deficit immediately
  after light onset (ANOVA post hoc Dunnett’s method, p = 0.002). The mGluR6 mutation
  silences the cone ON pathway in these mice, as indicated by the circuit diagram.(D)
  Littermate control mice confine their activity to the dark portions of the 12-h
  light – 12-h dark (12:12 LD) cycle (n = 5). Light and dark exposure is indicated
  by white and gray shading.(E) mGluR6; Opn4 dKO mice do not confine their activity
  to the dark portions of the day and instead free run in 12:12 LD (n = 10).(F) Quantification
  of period lengths from all animals (points indicate individual animals, error bars
  show SEM). Littermate control mice (blue) photoentrain to the light-dark cycle,
  as indicated by their period lengths equaling exactly 24 h. mGluR6; Opn4 dKO mice
  (red) free run in 12:12 LD, as indicated by their period lengths being similar in
  DD to LD. Littermate control and mGluR6; Opn4 dKO mice have comparable period lengths
  in DD (Student’s t test, p = 0.90). In 12:12 LD, the mean period lengths of mGluR6;
  Opn4 dKO mice do not equal 24 h (Student’s one-way t test, p = 0.02). See also  and
  .(G) Schematic depicting the visually guided behavioral task. Mice were trained
  in the two alternative forced choice paradigm to detect a light stimulus in one
  of two holes (). The testing chamber was kept dark except for the stimulus presented
  at photopic levels (28,000 R*/rod/s).(H) Littermate control mice (blue, n = 5) correctly
  detect the light stimulus in the visually guided task (G) in ~90% of the trials.
  mGluR6; Opn4 dKO mice (dark red, n = 4) correctly detect the light stimulus comparable
  with control mice (Student’s t test, p = 0.59). Error bars indicate SEM.'
