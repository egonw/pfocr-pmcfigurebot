caption: Schematic showing pathway of IL‐20 in AD. IL‐20 is upregulated in skin from
  AD, particularly in lesional AD. Skin lesion induces upregulation of IL‐20 receptors
  in sensory ganglia. IL‐20 triggers calcium influx in both keratinocytes and sensory
  neurons, promoting their AD‐related molecule release, and transcription of itch‐related
  genes. In sensory neurons, IL‐20 increases TLR2 transcripts, implicating a link
  between innate immune response and IL‐20. Intradermal co‐injection of IL‐13 and
  IL‐20 induces itch‐like behaviors in mice, but this is not observed in mice injected
  with IL‐13 or IL‐20 alone. Our findings provide novel insights into IL‐20 function
  in peripheral (skin‐derived) itch and clinically relevant intercellular neuron‐epidermal
  communication and highlight IL‐20 is functionally linked with lesional AD in human,
  thus forming a new basis for the development of a novel antipruritic strategy via
  interrupting IL‐20 signaling pathways
