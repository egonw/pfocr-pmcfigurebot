  and placenta scRNA-seq data
caption: a, UMAP plot of cells in PDAC tissues (top-left) separated into blood and
  tissue-resident immune cells (bottom-left). UMAP plot of cells in PDAC tissues after
  blood immune cell removal is shown on the top-right. b, The cell type proportion
  barplot shows the immune cell types in blood and PDAC tumor tissue, as well as all
  cell types in the tumor tissue before and after blood immune cell removal. c, Venn
  diagram of the significant DE genes identified when comparing immune cells in blood
  and tumor tissue. d, GSEA results comparing blood and tissue-resident immune cell
  types. e, Overall CCC in the tumor tissues before and after blood immune cell removal.
  f, CCC of MIF signaling pathway in tumor tissues before and after blood immune cell
  removal. g, UMAP plot of cells in placenta tissues deciphered into fetal vs. maternal
  origins and blood vs. placenta-resident cells. h, Cell type proportions in the different
  compartments related to the placenta. i, Upset plot of significant DE genes identified
  in common cell types between fetal and maternal placenta tissues. T-cell is excluded
  due to the near 0 counts in the fetal tissue. j, GSEA results comparing fetal and
  maternal tissues among common cell types. k-l, CCC of common cell types in fetal
  (k) and maternal (l) tissues.
