caption: The pathogenesis of NAFLD-related hepatocellular carcinoma is depicted here
  in the form of a diagram. Steatohepatitis (SH), alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH),
  non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), alcoholic liver disease (ALD), free fatty
  acid (FFA), cytochrome P-450 2E1 (CYP2E1), nicotineamide adenine dinucleotide. NASH
  disrupt the mitochondrial pathway of the liver, in an increase in FFA flow to the
  liver, mitochondrial ROS, oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. Due to the accumulation
  of severely damaged and dysfunctional mitochondria, deformed mitosis leads to cell
  death. This is caused by the release of bacterial traces (hypomethylated CpG motifs
  and formyl-peptides) stored in mitochondria, which can speed up the progression
  of hepatitis and NASH. The dinucleotide NAD+ raises the ratio of NADH to NAD+, resulting
  in steatosis. Increased CYP2E1 activities result in increased hydroxyl radicals,
  which is linked to the development of ALD. ↑, up-regulation; ↓, down-regulation.
