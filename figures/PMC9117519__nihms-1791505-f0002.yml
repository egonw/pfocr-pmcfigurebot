figure_title: Similar expression profiles of CCL22 mutant CLPD-NK to normal CD56bright
  NK cells
caption: a, Differentially expressed genes (blue dots; adjusted P value (p-adj) <0.01
  and log2 fold change >1.5 analyzed by DESeq2 R package) between CLPD-NK cases with
  CCL22 mutations and those with non-CCL22 mutations are shown in the volcano plot.
  Cytokine and chemokine genes (XCL1, XCL2, CSF2) and transcription factors (TCF7,
  HOXA9) were differentially expressed in CCL22 mutated samples. b, Heatmap showing
  the expression of representative core NK cell signature genes. Mean z-scores are
  represented in each subgroup; CLPD-NK with CCL22 mutations (CCL22), STAT3 mutations
  (STAT3), non-CCL22/STAT3 mutations (Other), and normal CD56bright and CD56dim NK
  cells. CCL22 mutated cases showed similar expression pattern to CD56bright normal
  NK cells in high expression of NCAM1 (CD56), chemokine/cytokine related genes with
  low expression of FCGR3A (CD16) and most cytotoxic genes. In contrast, STAT3 mutated
  cases showed similar expression pattern to CD56dim normal NK cells in high expression
  of cytotoxic genes. c, Heatmap comparing enriched GO terms of upregulated genes
  in each subgroup. There was a similarity of enriched GO terms in CCL22 mutated cases
  and CD56bright normal NK cells compared to non-CCL22 mutated cases. d, High GZMK
  expression in CCL22 mutant primary CLPD-NK samples and increased pSTAT3 in STAT3
  mutant primary CLPD-NK samples were validated by immunoblotting. e, Reduced cytotoxicity
  against CellTrace Far Red treated K562 cells (T; target) in CCL22-Pro79Arg transduced
  NK-92 cell line (E; effector) compared to empty vector or CCL22-wild type transduced
  NK-92 cells (E) were observed in all the tested E to T ratio. The mean (Â± SD) killing
  rate (%) from negative control (T only; 0%) and positive control (T only without
  CellTrace Far Red treatment; 100%) is shown (n=5). P value was calculated by t-test.
  ***0.0001 < p < 0.001. f, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of enriched gene sets in
  CLPD-NK cases with CCL22 mutations compared to non-CCL22 mutant cases. Dendritic
  cell maturation pathway and chemokine signaling pathway were enriched in CCL22 mutated
  cases.
