caption: Directed analysis statistics of ¹H_T₂ spectra of plasma samples from HCP
  3 months vs. HCP 1 year. (a) OPLS-DA score chart (n = 16, R2 = 0.888 and Q2 = −0.206,
  p = 0.2). (b) Bar graphs of normalized peak intensities of the identified metabolite
  with differences between the two groups. From left to right, the respective value
  of p of the t-test is 0.04, 0.02, 0.09, and 0.02. (c) Metabolic topology pathway
  results based on potential metabolites in OPLS-DA models.
