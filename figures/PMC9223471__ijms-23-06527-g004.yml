caption: Investigation of any interference by cells that are co-cultured with our
  target cells. The transduced human CHON-002 cells were co-cultured with the xenogeneic
  cells, which are mouse ATDC5 cells that cannot use ANL during protein synthesis.
  (A) Schematic diagram of decision on the origin (bovine, mouse, or human) of the
  shared peptide (top). All shared peptides between human and mouse proteins were
  excluded for further analysis (bottom). In the final decision, only proteins with
  two or more peptides were counted. (i) it was determined that only human protein
  was identified. (ii) both protein determined to be unidentified. (B) The number
  of the proteins identified after applying the criteria in the analyses of single
  shot or high pH reversed phase fractions. With fractionation, the number of the
  identified human proteins increased approximately four times. (C) Secretory pathway
  analysis of the identified proteins with or without fractionation.
