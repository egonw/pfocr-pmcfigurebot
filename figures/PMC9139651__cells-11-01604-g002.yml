caption: Schematic representation of defects arising from Sox2 deletion in the thalamus,
  hypothalamus, and cerebellum of Sox2 cKO mice. (A) Thalamus. Sox2 thalamic KO, mediated
  by Roralpha-Cre, leads to ablation of Sox2 expression in the medial geniculate nucleus
  (MGN, auditory), the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN, visual) and the ventroposterior
  nucleus (VPN, somatosensory). A reduction of the dLGN is observed in Sox2 cKO mice
  compared to controls (WT) and projections from the mutant dLGN to the primary visual
  cortex (V1) are reduced, leading to a mis-patterned V1. The expression of components
  of the Serotonin pathway and of the axon guidance molecule Ephrin A5 (Efna5) is
  reduced in Sox2 thalamic mutants compared to controls. (B) Hypothalamus. Sox2 conditional
  deletions by VGAT-Cre in clock neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) disrupts
  circadian rhythms and results in downregulation of clock genes (Per2 and Erk1/2).
  (C) Cerebellum. Sox2 deletion in the cerebellum, mediated by Wnt1-Cre, leads to
  a reduction in the size of the cerebellar vermis, aberrant morphology, and misplacement
  of bergmann glia (BG) and motor control problems. The border of expression of Otx2,
  between midbrain and hindbrain, is moved posteriorly in Sox2 cKO compared to controls.
