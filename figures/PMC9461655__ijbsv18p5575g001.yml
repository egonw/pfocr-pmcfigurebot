caption: TRPM4 mRNA expression is downregulated in CRC by promoter methylation. (A-H)
  Expression of TRPM4 was frequently downregulated in CRC tumor tissues compared with
  normal tissues in public databases. (I) Lower TRPM4 expression shows shorter overall
  survival. (J, K) Relationship between TRPM4 mRNA level and promoter methylationand
  copy number alteration in CRC (cBioPortal). (L, M) OncoPrint of TRPM4 alterations
  in CRC. (N) TRPM4 expression and promoter methylation are negatively correlated
  at the overall level, which is confirmed by the Pearson correlation coefficients
  on the right (MEXPRESS). Data are shown as meanÂ±SD *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p <
  0.001, ****p < 0.0001
article_title: A novel methylated cation channel TRPM4 inhibited colorectal cancer
  metastasis through Ca2+/Calpain-mediated proteolysis of FAK and suppression of PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  signaling pathway.
