caption: Perlecan-conjugated LM E8-fragments (p511/p521) mediated activation of the
  RAS-ERK1/2 pathway. (A, B) Relative level of activated RAS evaluated by ELISA coated
  with LM511E8/LM521E8 or p511/p521. Data are represented as the mean ± SD, n = 5,
  independent experiments. Paired t-test; *P < .05, **P < .01. (C) Immunohistochemistry
  of the grafts transplanted into SCID mice. Scale bars, 200 μm (upper images) and
  50 μm (middle and lower images). (D) The percentage of ERK phosphorylated cells
  to transplanted cells (hNuclei+ cells). Data are represented as the mean ± SD, n
  = 5-7, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test; *P < .05, **P
  < .01, ***P < .001. (E) Immunostaining images of hiPSC-derived DA neurons (day 42)
  on 4 different coatings with NR4A2 (NURR1) antibody (green) and Foxa2 antibody (red).
  (F, G) The percentage of NR4A2+ cells per Foxa2+ cells. Data are represented as
  the mean ± SD, n = 6 totally; 3 samples in each of 2 independent experiments. Unpaired
  t test; **P < .01, ****P < .0001. (H, I) NR4A2 expression analysis by quantitative
  RT-qPCR. The expression level of the cells with LM511E8/LM521E8 was set to 1.0.
  Data are represented as the mean ± SD, n = 3 independent experiments. Unpaired t
  test.
