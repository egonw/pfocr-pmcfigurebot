caption: 'PGC1α and SCD1 are two main effectors downstream of the Wnt/β-catenin-MITF
  pathway in melanoma cell ferroptosis. (a,b) Immunoblotting and qRT-PCR analysis
  of PGC1α and SCD1 levels in the melanoma cells between the RSL3 monotreatment group
  and RSL3 plus ICG001 combined treatment group (RSL3, 2 μM for A2058 and 0.5 μM for
  A375 for 24 h. 6 μM ICG001 for both A2058 and A375 for 24 h). (c,d) qRT-PCR analysis
  of a panel of antioxidant enzymes and COXIV in the melanoma cells with the indicated
  treatment for 24 h (RSL3, 2 μM for A2058 and 0.5 μM for A375; 6 μM ICG001 for both
  A2058 and A375). (e,f) The level of mitoROS and intracellular ATP in A2058 and A375
  with the indicated treatment for 24 h (RSL3, 2 μM for A2058 and 0.5 μM for A375;
  6 μM ICG001 and 10 μM Mito-tempo for both A2058 and A375). (g) Relative cell viability
  of melanoma cell lines receiving the following treatment: RSL3, 2 μM for A2058 and
  0.5 μM for A375, 6 μM ICG001 and 10 μM Mito-tempo for both A2058 and A375. (h) Lipid
  ROS levels of indicated cells were detected utilizing flow cytometry and employing
  C11-BODIPY which is related to (g). (i) Relative cell viability of both A2058 and
  A375 melanoma cell lines receiving a treatment with 2.5 μM A939572, RSL3 (2 μM for
  A2058 and 0.5 μM for A375), 10 μM ferrostatin-1 and 5 μM C91 for 24 h. (j) Lipid
  ROS levels of indicated cells measured utilizing flow cytometry and employing C11-BODIPY
  that is related to (i). Data are presented as mean ± SEM of triplicates. p-value
  was computed using a two-tailed Student’s t-test. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 and ***
  p < 0.001. ns, nonsignificant.'
