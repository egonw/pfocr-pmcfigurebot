caption: ATR pathway activation is essential for TNBC cell sensitivity to TOP1 inhibition.
  (A) Western blotting of proteins involved in DNA repair. BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells
  were treated with 1 µM topotecan and collected at the indicated time points. (B)
  Schematic diagram for the DNA damage response (DDR) signaling pathway induced by
  topotecan. (C) Microscopy of BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with DMSO, 1 µM
  topotecan, 1 µM VE-821, or 1 µM topotecan combined with 1 µM VE-821. (D) Viability
  of BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells with the indicated drug treatments (n = 3). (E) Western
  blotting of p-Chk1. BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with DMSO, 1 µM topotecan,
  1 µM VE-821, or 1 µM topotecan combined with 1 µM VE-821, and collected at 0, 2,
  and 12 hours post-treatment. (F) Western blotting of p-Chk1. BT549-res cells with
  continuous topotecan treatment and BT549 cells treated with 1 µM topotecan for 0,
  2, and 12 hours were collected. (G) Western blotting of p-Chk1 and Chk1. BT549-res
  cells treated with 1 µM VE-821 together with 1 µM topotecan were collected at 0,
  2, and 12 hours post-treatment. (H) Microscopy of BT549-res cells. Cells cultured
  in 1 µM topotecan were further treated with DMSO or 1 µM VE-821. (I) Viability of
  BT549-res cells. Cells cultured with 1 µM topotecan were treated with DMSO or 1
  µM VE-821. Luminescence was tested at 0, 24, and 48 hours post-treatment (n = 3).
  Data are presented as mean ± SD. Significance was calculated using two-tailed, unpaired
  Student's t test. *p < 0.05. Scale bars, 100 μm.
