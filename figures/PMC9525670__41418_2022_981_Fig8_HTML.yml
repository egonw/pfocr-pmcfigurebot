figure_title: Synergetic effect of Rb-EGF and Rb-Sema3A through EGFR/ERK signaling
  regulated by NRP1
caption: A NHEKs were serum starved and subsequently stimulated with Rb-Sema3A for
  5 min to 1 h and subjected to IF analyses. B Combined treatment with Rb-EGF and
  Rb-Sema3A was utilized in keratinocytes at the indicated time points. EGFR and NRP1
  localization/expression was shown by IF staining. Wound healing assays (C) and Transwell
  assays (D) were performed in Rb-Sema3A-,Rb-EGF and EGFR plasmids incubated in Hacat
  cells after transfected with si-NRP1 or negative control. The percentage of wound
  closure is displayed as the mean ± SEM; n = 3. Bars indicate the mean fold changes ± SEM
  relative to the corresponding control; n = 3. E Western blot analysis of EGFR-ERK
  pathway after treatment at the indicated time points. F Immunofluorescence in Hacat
  cells. si-NRP1 or si-NC plasmids were transfected in EGFR-overexpressing cells.
  Recombinant EGF and Sema3A cytokines were added in cells to test the process of
  NRP1 and EGFR activation and degradation. Scale bar = 20 µm. G A schematic of the
  proposed mechanism. **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
