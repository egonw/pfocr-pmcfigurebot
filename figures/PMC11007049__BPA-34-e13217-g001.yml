caption: 'Inhibition of FKBP12 partially suppresses SPI1‐induced TGF‐β1 non‐canonical
  signaling in GSCs. (A): GSEA enrichment plots of the PI3K/Akt pathway signatures
  in TCGA and CGGA gliomas high‐SPI1‐expression versus low‐SPI1‐expression levels.
  The plot presents normalized enrichment scores and false discovery rates. p = 0.007
  (TCGA), p = 0.010 (CGGA). (B): The levels of PI3K, p‐PI3K, Smad2/3, p‐Smad2/3 Akt,
  p‐Akt, Erk, and p‐Erk detected by WB analysis in M1 GSCs transduced with SPI1‐silencing
  shRNA and TGF‐β1res. (C): The levels of PI3K, p‐PI3K, Smad2/3, p‐Smad2/3 Akt, p‐Akt,
  Erk, and p‐Erk examined by WB analysis in GSCs transduced with empty vector or SPI1‐overexpressing
  plasmid, and subsequently treated with vehicle alone or LY2109761. (D): Blocking
  of PI3K/Akt signaling inhibits SPI1‐induced sphere‐formation in P1 GSCs. Representative
  images. Scale bar, 100 μm. (E): GSEA enrichment plots of PI3K/Akt pathway signatures
  in TCGA and CGGA gliomas comparing high and low FKBP12‐expression levels. The plot
  displays normalized enrichment scores and false discovery rates. p < 0.001 (TCGA),
  p < 0.001 (CGGA). (F): The levels of Smad2/3, PI3K, Akt, p‐Erk, p‐Smad2/3, p‐PI3K,
  p‐Akt, and p‐Erk detected by WB analysis in N1 GSCs transduced with FKBP12‐OE. (G):
  The levels of P‐Smad2/3, p‐PI3K, p‐Akt, and p‐Erk detected by Co‐IP analysis in
  SPI1‐overexpressed N1 GSCs transduced with either control shRNA or sh‐FKBP12. Results
  are presented as the mean ± SEM values of triplicate samples from three independent
  experiments. **p < 0.01. GSCs, glioma stem cells; GSEA, gene set enrichment analysis;
  SPI1, Salmonella pathogenicity island 1; TGF‐β1, Transforming growth factor‐β1;
  WB, western blotting.'
