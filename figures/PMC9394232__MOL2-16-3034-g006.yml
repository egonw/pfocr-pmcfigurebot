caption: 'The multiomics landscape between gemcitabine‐resistant and ‐sensitive PDAC
  samples classified by 28‐GPS in TCGA. PDAC, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma; 28‐GPS,
  28 gene pairs; TCGA, the cancer genome atlas; (A) Oncoplot shows 22 genes with mutation
  frequencies not less than 5% in the TCGA (R: 88; S: 52). Rows represent genes and
  columns represent samples. The genes in the red font indicate that the mutation
  frequencies in the resistant samples are significantly higher than that in the sensitive
  samples (P < 0.05, Fisher''s exact test). The left bar shows the mutation percentage
  between gemcitabine‐resistant and ‐sensitive samples and the top bar shows the total
  number of mutations. Clinical characteristics are also provided at the top. R, resistant
  samples; S, sensitive samples. (B) TMB difference between gemcitabine resistant
  and sensitive samples in the TCGA (R: 88; S: 52). In the violin plot, the centre
  line represents the median and the upper and lower lines represent the upper and
  lower quartiles. The vertical line reaches the maximum and minimum values. TMB,
  tumour mutational burden; R, resistant samples; S, sensitive samples. (C) HRDscore
  difference between gemcitabine resistant and sensitive samples in the TCGA (R: 88;
  S: 52). The centre line represents the median and the upper and lower lines represent
  the upper and lower quartiles. Each dot represents a sample. HRDscore, homologous
  recombination defect score; R, resistant samples; S, sensitive samples. (D) 28‐GPS
  resistance scores of different KRAS somatic mutations in TCGA (G12D: 43; G12C/R/V:
  45; Q61H: 6; Q61R: 2; G13C + G12A: 1). The centre line represents the median and
  the upper and lower lines represent the upper and lower quartiles. The vertical
  line reaches the maximum and minimum values. Each dot represents a sample. (E) The
  amplification and deletion difference of CNV between gemcitabine resistant and sensitive
  samples in the TCGA (R: 88; S: 52). The centre line represents the median and the
  upper and lower lines represent the upper and lower quartiles. The vertical line
  reaches the maximum and minimum values. CNV, copy number variation; Amp_R, amplification
  in resistant samples; Amp_s, amplification in sensitive samples; Del_R, deletion
  in resistant samples; Del_S, deletion in sensitive samples; (F) Volcano plot depicts
  hypermethylated and hypomethylated genes between gemcitabine resistant and sensitive
  samples in the TCGA (R: 88; S: 52). The horizontal dotted line shows the adjusted
  P value of 0.05. The vertical dotted line shows the fold change value of 1. (G)
  Venn map shows the intersection of DEMs and DEGs. DEMs, differentially expressed
  methylations; DEGs, differentially expressed genes; (H, I) KEGG pathway enrichment
  analyses on the intersection genes of DEMs and DEGs, representing underexpressed
  and hypermethylated genes (H), and overexpressed and hypomethylated genes (I), respectively.
  The red arrows represent immune‐related pathways. DEGs, differentially expressed
  genes; DEMs, differentially expressed methylations. [Colour figure can be viewed
