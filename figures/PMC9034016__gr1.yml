caption: The overview of RNA-seq experiments following the cGAS-STING signaling activation.
  (A) The schematic diagram of study design and sample collection for RNA-seq. (B)
  HFF cells were stimulated with HT-DNA, G3-YSD, HSV-1, cGAMP, and CpG-DNA for 9Â h,
  respectively. Then, cell lysates were collected for western blot analysis of STING,
  TBK1, IRF3, GAPDH, and the phosphorylation of STING, TBK1, IRF3. (C) The barplot
  of the number of mapped paired-end reads per RNA-seq sample. (D) The heatmap of
  the expression pattern of known ISGs following the treatment of three cGAS-STING
  pathway stimulators and one DNA virus.
