caption: Gene network and differential gene expression of functional pathways identified
  by enrichment analysis. (A) Interferon signalling pathway (R-HSA-913531) genes expressed
  in tissues were used to construct a protein interaction network by STRING. Levels
  of differential gene expression between control and mtDNA-supplemented-derived liver
  are shown as fold change relative to control by colour scale (right). (B) The tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle pathway (R-HSA-71403) genes expressed in tissues were used to construct
  a protein interaction network. Levels of differential gene expression between heterologous
  and autologous mtDNA-supplemented-derived brain are shown as fold change relative
  to autologous mtDNA-supplemented-derived brain by colour scale. The same colour
  scale was used as shown in (A). Genes displayed in grey boxes have no DEG data due
  to low or no expression in the corresponding tissues.
