caption: 'Venn diagrams and pathway enrichment of the differentially expressed proteins
  in comparison of NA and NN plants under normal growth conditions (control) and salt
  stress conditions. (A): the total 519 upregulated proteins; (B): the total 406 downregulated
  proteins; (C): the pathway changes when comparing NA and NN roots under control
  conditions with MapMan analysis; (D): the pathway changes when comparing NA and
  NN roots under salt stress conditions with MapMan analysis. Functional categories
  enrichment was made with Fisherâ€™s exact red color: pathways were significantly under-represented;
  blue color: pathways are significantly over-represented. NA: alfalfa plants with
  active nodules; NN: alfalfa plants without nodules.'
