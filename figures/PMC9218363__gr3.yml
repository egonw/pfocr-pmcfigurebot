caption: NSC49L-mediated activation of PP2AC(A) chemical structure of NSC49L.(B) human
  rPP2AC activity determined with the malachite green assay.(C) Kact(NSC49L) and Vmax
  values of NSC49L with PP2AC.(D) PP2A activity using immune complexes isolated with
  anti-PP2AC antibody from control and NSC49L-treated FOLFOX-HT29 cells. Data are
  the mean ± SE of three experiments.(E) Okadaic acid (OA), a PP2A inhibitor, blocks
  NSC49L and TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity to FOLFOX-HT29 cells. Cells were treated with
  different concentrations of NSC49L, TRAIL and OKA either alone are in combination
  as indicated in the figure. After 72 h treatment, cell viability was determined
  using the MTT-assay. ∗ = Significantly different as compared to NSC49L group, and
  ∗∗ = significantly different as compared to NSC49L+TRAIL group.(F) effect of OA
  on the IC50 of the TRAIL. Data are the mean ± SE of four estimations. The p < 0.05
  is considered significant.
