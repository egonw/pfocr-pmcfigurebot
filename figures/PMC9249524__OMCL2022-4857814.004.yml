caption: 'The downexpression of miR-376a reversed the effects of MALAT1 downregulation
  on OS cell proliferation and migration. (a) Cell apoptosis in Saos-2 and U2OS cell
  lines, detected by flow cytometry. (b) Cell migration in Saos-2 and U2OS cell lines,
  measured using the transwell assay. (c) Cell migration in Saos-2 and U2OS cell lines,
  measured using the scratch wound assay. (d) Cell proliferation in Saos-2 and U2OS
  cell lines, measured using the CCK-8 assay. (e) Cell cycle in Saos-2 and U2OS cell
  lines, detected by flow cytometry. State n = 3. Compared with sh-NC+miR-NC, ∗P <
  0.05; compared with sh-NC+miR-NC, &P < 0.05; compared with sh-MALAT1+miR-NC, #P
  < 0.05.'
