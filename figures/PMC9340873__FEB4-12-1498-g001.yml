caption: Ulinastatin increased surface expression of Mer protein. On the left, Mer
  protein level was detected by immunofluorescence assay. Representative fluorescence
  image of protein expression; on the right, the relative protein expression of Mer.
  Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation, one‐way ANOVA, n = 3. *P < 0.05
