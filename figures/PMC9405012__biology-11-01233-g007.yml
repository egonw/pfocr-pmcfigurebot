caption: The double in situ hybridization (D-ISH) result of LDH-A and HIF-1α RNA in
  skeletal muscle. Green fluorescence (upper left) and red fluorescence (upper right)
  represent LDH-A mRNA and HIF-1α mRNA, respectively. The yellow-green fluorescence
  (bottom right) indicates the location of these two mRNA. Nuclei are shown by blue
  fluorescence (bottom left). The three arrows show that these two mRNA are located
  at the same position.
