caption: 'The effect by targeting inhibition of USP7 on anti-tumor immune response:
  A Inhibit tumor growth and invasion, and decrease immunosuppressive activity of
  Treg cells by suppressing the formation of Tip60-mediated Foxp3 dimers that bind
  to CTLA4 and IL-10 genes, while simultaneously upregulating the expression of IL-2,
  IFN-γ and TNF‐α genes. B Promote M2 macrophages to polarize to M1 macrophages, increase
  tumor infiltration of IFN-γ + CD8 + T cells, also upregulate PD-L1 expression. C Inhibit
  PD-L1 expression and promote p53-dependent apoptosis in tumor cells via p53/MDM2
  pathway. D Identify CCDC6 and DNMT1 degradation to enhance the effect of combination
  PARP-inhibitor and DNA damage inducer RRx-001. E Overcome chemoresistance by combing
  USP7 inhibitor and cytarabine through downregulating CHK1 protein expression in
  leukemic, also by combing USP7 inhibitor with anthracycline and taxane through downregulating
  ABCB1 resistant protein expression in triple negative breast cancer'
