figure_title: The bivalent peptide blocks activation of p53 target genes but has negligible
  effect on pol II transcription in the absence of p53 activation
caption: '(A) Schematic of the stapled, bivalent peptide.(B) Volcano plot showing
  significant induction of p53 target genes upon Nutlin treatment.(C) Volcano plot
  showing that the bivalent peptide reduces expression of p53 target genes in Nutlin-treated
  cells.(D) Enrichment score (GSEA) heatmap for Nutlin and Nutlin + peptide at a core
  set of p53 target genes. The p53 pathway is the most significantly altered pathway
  in both contexts: most upregulated in Nutlin and most downregulated in Nutlin +
  peptide ( and ).(E) Volcano plot showing that the bivalent peptide causes virtually
  no significant changes in pol II transcription in the absence of p53 activation.
  Although MT1M met the significance cutoff, the data showed an outlier in one DMSO
  replicate, suggesting that it does not reflect a true biological difference (see
  ). RNA-seq data were obtained in biological replicate.'
