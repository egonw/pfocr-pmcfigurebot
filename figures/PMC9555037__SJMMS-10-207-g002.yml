caption: 'RGN induces Nrf2 expression in DON-treated HepG2 cells. Membranes were investigated
  using anti-Nrf2, anti-γGCLC, and anti-HO-1 antibodies. Data are mean ± SD of values
  (n = 3), and *P < 0.05 represents key differences compared to DON alone. #P < 0.05
  for RGN compared with the DON treatment groups'
