caption: 'Measuring TRPV1 mRNA and protein levels and co-expression of NeuN and TRPV1
  in DRG. (A) TRPV1 mRNA levels in the DRG. (B) TRPV1 protein bands in the DRG. (C)
  TRPV1 protein expression in DRG. (D) Co-expression of TRPV1 and NeuN in DRG. (E)
  Relative fluorescence intensity levels of NeuN and TRPV1 co-expression. TRPV1 mRNA,
  protein expression, and the co-expression of NeuN and TRPV1 in the P2X7 shRNA and
  p38 inhibitor groups were lower than in the DNP group. Blue staining (DAPI) marks
  the nucleus, green staining (NeuN) marks the neuron, red staining marks TRPV1, and
  the yellow signal is a combination of green and red signals. The scale bar represents
  50 μm; data are shown as mean ± SEM based on at least three independent experiments,
  n = 6; ** p < 0.01 versus the Control group; ## p < 0.01 versus the DNP group.'
