caption: 'Tau regulates the microtubule-dependent migration of glioblastoma U87MG
  cells via the Rho-ROCK signaling pathway. Directional cell migration requires spatiotemporal
  control of focal adhesion formation and dissociation: (upper model) in Tau-expressing
  cell, good stabilization and bundling of microtubules (1) are positioned at the
  tail of polarized cells; during migration, the active phosphorylated forms of FAK
  and p190-RhoGAP proteins are delivered (2) to focal adhesion at the rear of cells
  (3), thus reducing anchoring and limiting activity of the Rho-ROCK axis (4); this
  could moderate actin polymerization (5); and good tail retraction results on, which
  contributes to a coordinated back-to-front movement of cell; (lower schema) in Tau-depleted
  cells, microtubules are less stabilized and weakly organized in bundles in the back
  of cells (1); the delivery of FAK and p190-RhoGAP proteins to the back of cells
  is defected (3); high anchoring on focal adhesion and removal of the restrictive
  activity of the Rho-ROCK pathways (4) leads to excessive actin polymerization (5);
  and bad tail retraction is observed.'
