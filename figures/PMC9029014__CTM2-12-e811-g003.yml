caption: 'Gemin6 promotes tumour cell proliferation and migration. (A) Establishment
  of Gemin6 knockdown in A549 verified by real‐time RT‐PCR (top) and immunoblot (bottom).
  Ctrl = control, sh#1 = shRNA#1, sh#2 = shRNA#2. Unpaired t‐test. (B) The growth
  curve of indicated cells. One‐way ANOVA. (C and D) Representative immunofluorescence
  staining of BrdU incorporation assay in A549. Scale bar: 50 μm. (D) Quantification
  data for (C). Unpaired t‐test. (E and F) The colony assay for A549 and H1975. (F)
  Quantification data for (E). Unpaired t‐test. (G) The growth curves of indicated
  cells (left), and the forced expression of Gemin6 was validated by immunoblot (right).
  Green arrow: exogenous Gemin6‐Flag; black arrow: endogenous Gemin6. One‐way ANOVA.
  (H and I) Indicated cells were stained by PI, and the cell cycle transition was
  examined by FACS analysis. (I) Quantification data for (H). Unpaired t‐test. (J)
  Total cell extracts were examined by immunoblot to detect indicated protein expressions
  with indicated antibodies. (K and L) Representative images for the wound healing
  assay in A549. Scale bar: 100 μm. (L) Quantification data for (K). Unpaired t‐test.
  (M) Indicated EMT signaling pathway regulators were examined by immunoblot with
  indicated antibodies. (N) Representative xenograft tumours generated using A549
  cells are shown. (O) Statistical histogram of the weights of xenograft tumours.
  Unpaired t‐test, n = 9. (P) Statistic changes of tumour volumes at different time
  points are shown. One‐way ANOVA, n = 9. (Q) Representative IHC staining images of
  Gemin6 and Ki67 in the xenograft tumours. Scale bar: 50 μm. Bars are the mean value ± SEM.
