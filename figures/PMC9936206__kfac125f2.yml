caption: 'Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in response to ethyl-parathion
  exposure as indicated by DCF fluorescence in SH-SY5Y cells. Vertical bars represent
  mean values, whereas error bars represent standard error. N-acetyl L-cysteine (NAC)
  was used as ROS scavenger which was applied to the 10 µg/ml ethyl-parathion exposure.
  The Mann-Whitney rank sum test of fluorescence among the 10 µg/ml ethyl-parathion
  and 10 µg/ml ethyl-parathion + 100 µg/ml NAC treatments was statistically significant,
  as indicated by the bracket among treatments (Y axis represents in millions). Significance
  values are represented as follows: “*” for p = .05 and “**” for p = .01.'

  SH-SY5Y cells provide neurotoxicity pathway indicators for organophosphorus impacts.
