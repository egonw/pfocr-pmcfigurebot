figure_title: MAA-adducted ECM leads to altered UPR and acinar cell death
caption: A, B) IF analysis (A) and colocalization coefficient (B) of MAA adducts and
  collagen-I (Col1A1) in cerulein alone and cerulein and combination mice pancreata.
  C) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for differentially altered proteins showing
  attenuated UPR in the combination group. D) Enrichr-based pathway analysis using
  significantly altered proteins from cerulein vs. cerulein and combination group.
  E, F) IF analysis for the expression (E) and quantification (F) of ER stress markers,
  CLIMP63 and CHOP, in cerulein vs. cerulein and combination group. G) Comparative
  fold change analysis for UPR genes, IRE1A, and CHOP in the pancreata of saline,
  cerulein, and cerulein and combination group. H) Isolation and culture of primary
  acini from mouse pancreas on collagen and MAA-adducted collagen-coated plates. I,
  J) Annexin V-based acinar cell survival assay on collagen and MAA- adducted collagen-coated
  plates (I) and immunoblot analysis for expression of cleaved PARP (J) upon cerulein
  and cerulein and the combination treatment. *P<0.05, **P<0.01.
