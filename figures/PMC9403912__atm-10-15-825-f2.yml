caption: 'Western blot analysis of TGF-β1/Smad signaling molecules in rats with experimentally
  induced colitis. (A) Western blot of the TGF-β1, Smad3, Smad4, Smad7, and GAPDH
  (loading control) protein levels in the intestinal tissues. (B) Levels of TGF-β1,
  Smad3, Smad4, and Smad7 standardized to the loading control. Blank: normal untreated
  rats; TNBS: colitic rats; TNBS + FMT: colitic rats treated with fecal microbiota
  transplantation; TNBS + Ped: colitic rats treated with prednisone; TNBS + SB431542:
  colitic rats treated with the TGF-β1 inhibitor SB431542. *, P<0.05 vs. the Blank
  group; #, P<0.05 vs. the TNBS group. GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  TGF-β1, transforming growth factor-beta 1; TNBS, 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid.'
