caption: 'Screening of targets and pathways of miR-613 in RCC using bioinformatics.
  (A) The potential target genes of miR-613 were screened in the PITA, microT, miRanda,
  and TargetScan databases, and 239 intersecting genes were found. (B) Analysis of
  a volcano map of DEGs. The red dots represent 20 upregulated DEGs, the green dots
  represent 17 downregulated DEGs, and the black dots represent genes that are not
  differentially expressed in RCC tissues. (C) Heat map analysis of the differential
  expression of the 239 intersecting genes in kidney cancer and normal tissues. (D)
  Univariate Cox regression analysis of the risk characteristics of 20 upregulated
  DEGs associated with renal cancer prognosis.DEG: differentially expressed gene.'
