caption: Overview of the transport of CSF and ISF through meningeal lymphatic vessels.
  Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is transported within a specialized perivascular network
  that helps to remove metabolic products from the central nervous system to the peripheral
  circulation system. A) CSF transport in the glymphatic pathway through periarterial
  inflow and perivenous outflow. CSF in the subarachnoid space flows into the brain
  through the perivascular space of the perforating arteries, which is called the
  periarterial inflow. Through glymphatic CSF/interstitial fluid (ISF) exchange in
  the brain parenchyma, metabolic wastes such as Aβ and cytokines are excreted toward
  the perivenous space. These products ultimately reach deep cervical lymph nodes
  (dCLNs) and peripheral circulation through meningeal lymphatic vessels. B) Magnified
  schematic illustration of CSF inflow and ISF outflow to the subarachnoid space along
  the periarterial and perivenous space.
