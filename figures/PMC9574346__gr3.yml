caption: Azelnidipine inhibits the MEK-ERK signaling pathway(A and B) In vitro kinase
  assay of active MEK1 and MEK2 and inactive ERK1 and ERK2. The active MEK1 (A) and
  MEK2 (B), inactive ERK1 and ERK2, and ATP mixture were treated with Az or DMSO at
  30°C for 30 min, and p-ERK1/2 T202/Y204 were visualized by Western blot. (C) The
  levels of MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway in ESCC cells after Az (0, 1, 2.5, 5,
  and 10 μM) treatment. (D and E) Immunofluorescence staining of p-ERK1/2 T202/Y204
  (D) and ERK1/2 (E) in ESCC cells after Az treatment. (F) Cell cycle was analyzed
  by PI staining, and the number of cells in each phase was analyzed by Modfit (n =
  3). (G) The levels of Cyclin D1 and CDK6 in ESCC cells after Az (0, 1, 2.5, 5, and
  10 μM) treatment. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001.
