caption: Clustering of pathways associated with RA. Comparing the methylation profile
  of n=301 patients and n=305 healthy individuals, a total of 246 biological processes
  were found to be associated with RA using gometh. In this heatmap, the associated
  GO terms (rows and columns) are clustered according to their similarity based on
  Lin's measure [38]. The terms are then hierarchically clustered using complete linkage,
  and the tree is cut at the desired threshold (here 0.7). For each resulting cluster,
  the biological process showing the most significant association with RA was chosen
  as the representative biological function (right legend). A total of n=20 pathway
  clusters were identified associated with RA.
