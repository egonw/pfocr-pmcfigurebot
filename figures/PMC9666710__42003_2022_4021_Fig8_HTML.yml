figure_title: Comprehensive serine/threonine/tyrosine phosphoproteomics confirm EGFR1
  pathway involvement in TgErbB2 hypertrophy and tyrosine kinase receptor inhibition
  by AG-825
caption: a A heatmap was used to visualize the unsupervised hierarchical clustering
  of Ser/Thr peptides, and b pTyrosine peptides normalized to full proteome expression
  with p-value < 0.05 by ANOVA. Overrepresented (yellow) and underrepresented (Blue).
  c Volcano plots showing the Log2 fold-change and –Log10 p-value of each pSer/pThr
  peptide and d pTyr peptides in the pairwise comparison of Ntg and TgErbB2 after
  two weeks of Vehicle Treatment. e Volcano plots showing the Log2 fold-change and
  –Log10 p-value of each pSer/pThr peptide and f pTyr peptides in the pairwise comparison
  of Ntg and TgErbB2 after two weeks of AG-825 Treatment, (g) KSEA shows in a red
  rectangle the kinases significantly inhibited by AG-825. KSEA and Pathway Enrichment
  Analysis of combined Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphorylation data analysis using PTMSigDB confirm
  that EGFR1 Pathway is significantly involved. h The Signaling Network Open Resource
  (Signor 2.0) analysis shows that nine kinases are involved in the EGFR pathway.
  Kinases found in the network and also in KSEA are circled in dotted blue circles.
  The symbol code of the network is displayed next to the pathway.
