caption: Resistant starches from different dietary pulses may impact specific metabolite
  pathways in the gut. Metabolic pathway analysis and metabolite set enrichment analysis
  (MSEA) based on metabolites associated with dietary fiber groups (resistant starch
  or inulin) relative to standard western-style diet group. Metabolites are mapped
  to KEGG metabolic pathways. Scatter plots of pathway impact and − log p value and
  relative abundance of metabolites related to significantly enriched metabolic pathway.
  CTL control western-style diet group, PTB pinto beans, BEP black-eyed peas, LEN
  lentils, INU inulin.
