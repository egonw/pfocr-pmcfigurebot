caption: Inactivated TGFβ, BMP, AKT signaling pathways are improved in S/2i condition.
  (A) Principal component analysis (PCA) showing the transcriptome difference among
  S- (blue and green), S/2i- (red), and N/2i- (purple) mESCs. The sexes of mESC lines
  are indicated. The data for N/2i (purple) and S (green) conditions are cited from
  GSE84164 (Yagi et al., ). (B) Volcano Plot showing the global differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs) between male N/2i- and S/2i-mESCs. Vertical line indicates expression
  fold change = 2, and horizontal line indicates P-value = 0.01. (C) DEGs showing
  a dysregulation of stem cell differentiation, cell cycle, stem cell maintenance
  and embryo development related genes in N/2i-mESCs. These gene sets were cited from
  Gene Ontology Browser on MGI website (http://www.informatics.jax.org/vocab/gene_ontology).
  Vertical line indicates expression fold change = 2, and horizontal line indicates
  P-value = 0.01. (D) Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showing a global upregulation
  of genes related to TGFβ receptor signaling pathway (left, n = 185), BMP signaling
  pathway (middle, n = 173) and AKT signaling pathway (right, n = 207) in S/2i-mESCs
  compared to N/2i mESCs. These gene sets were cited from Gene Ontology Browser on
  MGI website. NES, normalized enrichment score; FDR, false discovery rate. (E) Venn
  diagram showing the overlap of upregulated genes in male and in female S/2i-mESCs
  versus N/2i-mESCs. The list of 1,581 genes are shown in Data S2. Two male and two
  female cell lines were used in this test. Fold change > 2, P < 0.01. (F) KEGG pathways
  enrichment analysis of the 1,581 overlapping upregulated genes, as indicated in
  Fig. 2E. Representative pathways are shown. (G) Calling of significantly enriched
  motifs (363) from the 1,581 overlapping upregulated genes caused by S/2i, as indicated
  in Fig. 2E. Representative motifs of Klf and Smad family are shown. (H) Representative
  genes related to TGFβ receptor, BMP and AKT signaling pathway were consistently
  downregulated in N/2i-mESCs. Data are represented as the mean  ±  SEM. Statistical
  analysis was performed using a two-tailed unpaired Welch’s t-test. *P < 0.05; **P
  < 0.01
