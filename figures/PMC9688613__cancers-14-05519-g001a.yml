caption: Inhibitory effects of CLEFMA on viability and formed cell colonies in human
  OSCC cells. (A) The molecular structure of CLEFMA. (B) SG cells, (C) HSC-3, and
  (D) SCC-9 cells treated with 0–16 μM CLEFMA for 24 h and then subjected to MTT cell
  viability assay. (E) Digital image showing colonies produced by HSC-3 and SCC-9
  cells, treated with 0–8 μM CLEFMA with colony formation assay. (F) The quantification
  of formed cell colonies. (G) SCC-9 cells were treated with paclitaxel (taxol) alone
  or in combination with CLEFMA and then subjected to MTT assay. Data represent the
  average ± SD from three independent experiments. * p < 0.05 compared with the DMSO
  control group.
