caption: Functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed circular RNAs
  (circRNA). (A) Volcano plot upon CVB5 infection. Red dots represent upregulated
  circRNAs and green dots represent downregulated circRNAs. (B) Venn diagram showing
  a comparison of differentially expressed circRNAs. The analysis comprises 173 upregulated
  and 64 downregulated circRNAs, respectively. (C) KEGG enrichment analysis, the x-axis
  shows the GO term, and the y-axis shows the percentage of genes and gene numbers.
  (D) GO functional enrichment analysis. The x-axis shows the enrichment factor, and
  the y-axis shows the pathway names. The point size represents the number of genes
  enriched in a particular pathway.
