caption: 'LPS released by MRT+MH-treated Fn activates antitumor immune responses in
  vitro. (a) Flow cytometry plots of CD86- and F4/80-positive macrophage (M1 phenotype)
  fractions of BMDMs after treatment with the conditioned media containing supernatants
  of Fn in different groups, and commercial LPS (10 μg/mL) was used as a positive
  control. (b) Quantified secretion levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12 and TNF-α in the
  supernatants of BMDMs after corresponding treatments (n = 3). (c) Western blotting
  analysis of TLR4–MyD88–NF-κB pathway in BMDMs after various treatments in vitro.
  (d) NO secretion of BMDMs detected by Griess assay kit. Inset: digital photos of
  different groups after reaction (Control, MR+MH, MRT+MH and LPS groups from left
  to right) (n = 3). (e) Viabilities of CT26 cells co-cultured with BMDMs stimulated
  by the various conditioned media by CCK-8 (n = 6). Data are expressed as means ± SD
  (n = 3 or 6). Statistical significances were calculated via one-way ANOVA, *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001.'
