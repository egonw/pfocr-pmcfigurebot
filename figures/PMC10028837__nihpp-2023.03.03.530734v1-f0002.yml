figure_title: Mutation of pgl increases resistance to oxacillin
caption: A. Oxacillin MICs of JE2, pgl and the complemented pgl mutant in Mueller
  Hinton broth with 2% NaCl (MHB), chemically defined media (CDM) and CDM with glucose
  (CDMG). B and C. Growth of JE2, pgl and pglcomp for 25 hrs at 35°C in CDM (B) and
  CDMG (C) supplemented with OX 10 μg/ml. Growth (OD600) was measured at 15 min intervals
  in a Tecan plate reader. Data are the average of 3 independent experiments and error
  bars represent standard deviation.
