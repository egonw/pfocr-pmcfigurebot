caption: '(A) Western blot analysis to determine the expressions of proapoptotic Bcl2-family
  (tBid, Bax, Bak and Bad), prosurvival Bcl2-family (Bcl2, BclxL and pBad), and downstream
  of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (Apaf1, Cytochrome c and cleaved-caspase-9) in
  the cerebral cortices of CON-G, DM-G, and DMEX-G. (B) Relative protein quantification
  of proapoptotic Bcl2-family, pro-survival Bcl2-family and downstream of mitochondrial
  apoptotic pathway normalized to α-tubulin protein, respectively. Data are expressed
  as mean ± SD (n = 6). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 compared to CON-G; # p < 0.05, ##
  p < 0.01 compared to DM-G. CON-G, control group; DM-G, streptozotocin-induced diabetic
  group; DMEX-G, streptozotocin-induced diabetes with swimming exercise group.'
