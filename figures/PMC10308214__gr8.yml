caption: 'Relationships between microbiota-related outcomes and behavioral parameters
  affected by Exercise and/or Sex among female and male mice. In females (left panel),
  enrichment of the peptidoglycan synthesis pathway positively correlated with the
  mean time spent in grooming bouts (Splash Mean T) in the splash test but negatively
  correlated with the number of grooming bouts (Splash # bouts) in this test as well
  as with the number of entries into the corners (OF Corners) in the open field. The
  Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group in females also negatively correlated with the number
  of entries in the corners in the open field (OF Corners). **p < .01, ***p < .005,
  and ****p < .001.'
