caption: 'SERPINA3C protects against adipose inflammation by inhibiting Cathepsin
  G-mediated turnover of Integrin α5/β1 protein to induce AKT activity.A and B: 3T3-L1
  adipocytes were pretreated with TNFα for 12 h. Then SEPRINA3C and AKT inhibitor
  was added into the cell culture medium as indicated. mRNA levels of the indicated
  genes were determined by qPCR in (A). Western blot analysis of the indicated protein
  levels was performed in (B). C: Quantification of WB shown in (B). Image J was used
  to calculate band intensities. n = 3. D: 8-week-old WT and SERPINA3C–KO male mice
  were fed with 16-week HFD before being sacrificed. Protein levels of integrin α5,
  β1, α6, αv, β3, and β5 were determined. n = 3. E: 8-week-old C57BL/6J male mice
  with 4-week HFD feeding were injected with AAV at iWAT, and then HFD feeding was
  continued for another 12 weeks before mice were sacrificed. Protein levels of integrin
  α5 and integrin β1 were determined. n = 3. F: Cells were treated with Cathepsin
  G and/or SERPINA3C for 12 h. Protein levels of integrin α5 and integrin β1 were
  determined. G: Quantification of WB shown in (F). Image J was used to calculate
  band intensities. n = 3. H: Flow cytometry analysis of the indicated protein levels
  in Cathepsin G or SERPINA3C treated adipocytes. Cells were treated with Cathepsin
  G and/or SERPINA3C for 12 h. I: 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with TNFα and/or
  SERPINA3C for 12 h, in the presence or absence of 10 μmol ATN-161 (an inhibitor
  of integrin α5/β1 signaling). Western blot analysis of the indicated protein levels
  was performed. J: Quantification of WB shown in (I). Image J was used to calculate
  band intensities. n = 3. K: 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with TNFα and/or SERPINA3C
  for 12 h, in the presence or absence of 10 μmol ATN-161. mRNA levels of TNFα were
  determined by qPCR. L: SERPINA3C-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were stimulated with
  insulin, ATN-161 was added to block integrin α5/β1 signaling. 3T3-L1 adipocytes
  were treated with SERPINA3C and/or ATN-161 for 12 h. Then cells were stimulated
  with or without insulin (100 nmol/L) for 10 min before being harvested. 2-DG uptake
  assay was performed. For statistical analyses, one-way analysis of variance and
  Bonferroni’s post hoc tests were performed in (A), (C), (G), (J), (K) and (L). All
  values are represented as means with error bars representing S.D. ∗, p < 0.05; ∗∗,
  p < 0.01, ∗∗∗, p < 0.001. #, p < 0.05; ##, p < 0.01; ###, p < 0.001. n = 6 for each
  group unless otherwise mentioned.'
