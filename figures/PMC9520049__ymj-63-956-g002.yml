figure_title: Didymin pretreatment protects neurological injury and reduces apoptosis
  in rats. (A) H&E staining was performed to observe the pathological changes of MCAO
  rats (n=5/group). (B) The brain water content was detected (n=5/group). (C) TUNEL
  staining was performed to detect the apoptosis of brain tissues (n=5/group). (D)
  Measurements of neurological scores in mice (n=5/group). (E) Western blot was performed
  to detect the protein expression of Bax, c-caspase-3, and Bcl-2 (n=5/group). *p<0.05
  vs. Sham group; †p<0.05 vs. MCAO group; ‡p<0.05 vs. MCAO+0.5 mg/kg didymin group.
  MCAO, middle cerebral artery occlusion
