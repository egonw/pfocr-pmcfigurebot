caption: GZ17-6.02 induces changes in gene and protein expression in GSCs. (a) PCA
  plot of transcriptome data demonstrates separation of control and GZ17-6.02 treated
  D10-0171 and D317 GSCs. (b) Venn diagram of shared and unique differentially expressed
  genes in GZ17-6.02 treated D10-0171 and D317 GSCs. (c) Volcano plot of differentially
  expressed genes in D10-0171 following GZ17-6.02 treatment. (d) Volcano plot of differentially
  expressed genes in D317 following GZ17-6.02 treatment. Shared differentially expressed
  genes in GZ17-6.02 treated D10-0171 and D317 GSCs that are associated with glioblastoma
  growth and invasion are labeled on both volcano plots. (e) Top 10 downregulated
  pathways in D10-0171 following GZ17-6.02 treatment identified by GSEA using the
  Hallmark database as reference. (f) Enrichment plots for E2F targets and G2M checkpoint
  in GZ17-6.02 treated D10-0171 GSCs. (g) Top 10 downregulated pathways in D317 following
  GZ17-6.02 treatment identified by GSEA using the Hallmark database as reference.
  (h) Enrichment plots for glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in GZ17-6.02 treated
  D317 GSCs. (i) GSVA comparison of EGFR signaling pathway in control and GZ17-6.02
  treated D10-0171 and D317 GSCs. (j) GSVA comparison of activation of MAPK activity
  pathway in control and GZ17-6.02 treated D10-0171 and D317 GSCs. (k) Functional
  enrichment analysis (Metascape []) of downregulated pathways across input gene lists
  of phospho-proteins in D10-171 showing decreased expression following GZ17-6.02
  treatment. (l) Functional enrichment analysis (Metascape []) of downregulated pathways
  across input gene lists of phospho-proteins in D317 showing decreased expression
  following GZ17-6.02 treatment. Dashed lines represent a p-value of 0.05 * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001. DEG, differentially expressed gene; NES, normalized
  enrichment score; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; EGFR, epidermal growth factor
  receptor; GSVA, gene set variation analysis; TOR, target of rapamycin.
