caption: No involvement of the PI-/PC-PLC signaling pathway in the action of exendin-4.
  A, B Plots of the average peak current amplitudes as a function of time, showing
  that exendin-4-induced suppression of GABA currents is still seen in the presence
  of 10 μmol/L U73122 (A) or 60 μmol/L D 609 (B). The waveforms shown below the data
  lines are the current responses recorded at the times indicated by I, II, and III
  in A and B. Note that exendin-4 has similar suppressive effects on the GABA currents
  compared with normal Ringer’s. P <0.01, P <0.001, P >0.05, one-way ANOVA with post
  hoc Tukey’s test.
