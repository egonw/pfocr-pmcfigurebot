figure_title: Elevated claudin-4 expression correlates to DNA repair and response
  to DNA damaging agents
caption: A) Patient tumors within the TCGA (Firehose Legacy) were stratified based
  on the median expression of CLDN4 expression (Low, N=154 and High, N=153). B) Volcano
  plot of 1582 differentially regulated genes between low CLDN4 expressing tumors
  and high CLDN4 expressing tumor. C) Reactome pathway analysis of 1582 genes. D)
  Representative genes from Reactome DNA repair, replication and cycle pathways. E)
  Drug sensitivity of DNA damaging agents based on CLDN4 expression. Error bars, SEM.
  Statistical test, unpaired t-test with Benjamini-Hochberg multicomparison correction,
  ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001.
