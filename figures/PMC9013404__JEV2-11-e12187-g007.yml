caption: Intratumoral delivery of bi‐functional ASO suppresses breast cancer growth
  by triggering apoptosis and RIG‐I mediated immune responses. (a) Schematic treatment
  of mouse 4T1 mammary tumours in BALB/c mice with intratumoral delivery of 3p‐125b‐ASO
  in RBCEVs. (b) Volume of 4T1 tumours injected intratumorally with 5 mg/kg RBCEVs
  containing 3p‐125b‐ASO or NC RNA every three days (n = 5 mice). (c) qPCR analysis
  of miR‐125b relative to sno234 in untreated and treated 4T1 tumours (n = 5 mice).
  (d) qPCR analysis of RIG‐I pathway gene expression relative to Gapdh in untreated
  and treated 4T1 tumours (n = 5 mice). (e) Flow cytometry analysis of immune cells
  in untreated and treated 4T1 tumours (n = 5 mice). NEUT, neutrophils; NK, natural
  killer cells; MΦ, macrophages; DCs, dendritic cells. (f) Multiplex immunoassay analysis
  of cytokine concentration (conc.) in the tumour lysates of mice (n = 3 mice). (g)
  qPCR analysis of cytokine gene expression relative to Gapdh in untreated and treated
  4T1 tumours (n = 5 mice). (h) Representative images of TUNEL staining (orange fluorescence)
  of untreated and treated 4T1 tumour sections. Cancer‐associated fibroblasts (green)
  were stained with anti‐αSMA antibody. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst (blue). Scale
  bar, 50 μm. T, Tumour; S, Stroma. (i) Average mean intensity per nucleus area of
  TUNEL staining signals (n = 4 mice). All bar graphs represent mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001 determined by Student's two‐tailed
  t‐test
