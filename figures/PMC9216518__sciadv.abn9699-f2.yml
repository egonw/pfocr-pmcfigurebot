caption: (A) mtDNA mutation burden in different thyroid cancer subtypes. *P < 0.05
  and ***P < 0.001. N.S., not significant. (B) HCC, HA, PDTC, TCV-PTC, and normal
  samples in the first two components of PCA space. (C) Differential metabolite abundance
  test between HCC tumor and HA samples. (D) Volcano plot of DA test in HCC tumor
  versus PDTC and TCV-PTC. (E) Metabolic changes of lysine degradation pathway in
  HCC tumors relative to normals. NADP+, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate;
  NADPH, reduced form of NADP+. (F) The proportion of differentially abundant metabolites
  in tumors relative to normal tissues for HCC and other cancer types. Despite a comparatively
  small sample size and statistical power to detect changes in metabolite levels relative
  to datasets, HCC is characterized by a high proportion of differentially abundant
  metabolites. BRCA1, breast invasive carcinoma, study 1; BRCA2, breast invasive carcinoma,
  study 2; BLCA, bladder urothelial carcinoma; HCC, hürthle cell carcinoma; KIRC,
  kidney renal clear cell carcinoma; OV, ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma; PRAD1,
  prostate adenocarcinoma, study 1; PRAD2, prostate adenocarcinoma, study 2; PAAD1,
  pancreatic adenocarcinoma, study 1; PAAD2, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, study 2; PAAD3,
  pancreatic adenocarcinoma, study 3; and refer to Reznik et al. () for the details
  in each study. (G) Significantly differentially abundant metabolites in HCC (red
  color) and other cancer types (black color) in (F). Specific metabolites show exceptionally
  large-magnitude decreases/increases in abundance in HCC, including citrate, aconitate,
  glucose, NAD+, and vitamin C.
