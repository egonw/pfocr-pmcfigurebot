caption: 'NAM induces mitochondrial dysfunctions in TNBC cells. (A) Mitochondrial
  membrane potential of triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells after nicotinamide
  (NAM) treatment (25 mm, 24 h) was measured using flow cytometry (left) and Mitotracker
  red staining (250 nm) under confocal microscopy (right; scale bar = 100 μm). (B)
  JC‐1 (10 nm) fluorescent ratio also indicated that NAM decreased mitochondrial membrane
  potential. (C) Real‐time mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) after NAM
  treatment were measured in all TNBC cells by Agilent’s Seahorse XF24 analyzer. (D)
  Representative graphs of quantification of the basal‐, ATP‐linked‐, maximal‐, nonmitochondrial‐OCR
  and proton leak after NAM treatment. (E) ATP production rate assay demonstrated
  alterations in mitochondrial ATP pathway and glycolytic ATP pathway. OCRs and ATP
  production rate were measured after 24 h of NAM treatment (BT20, 20 mm; MDA‐MB‐468
  and MDA‐MB‐231, 40 mm). (F) Western blotting and relative levels of ATP5A, UQCRC2,
  MTCO1, SDHB and NDUFBB after NAM treatment. The quantification values are normalized
  to HSC70 as a loading control using the imagej software. Bar graphs are presented
  in mean ± SEM from triplicate experiment. Comparisons were made using a two‐tailed
  t‐test, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. (Abbreviations: JC‐1, 5,5'',6,6''tetrachloro‐1,1'',3,3''‐tetraethylbenzimidazol‐carbocyanine
  iodide).'
