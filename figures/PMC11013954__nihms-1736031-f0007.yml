caption: Role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response signaling pathway dysregulated in patients
  diagnosed with BLKIS. The gene symbols in red font represent genes containing SNPs
  associated with an increased risk of developing cancer. Genes without genetic variants
  are shown in black font. The solid lines with arrows indicate the direction of regulation.
  The double rings indicate regulatory complexes.
