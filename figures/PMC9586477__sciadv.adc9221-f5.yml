figure_title: RORγt-K256R impairs the pathways critical for the pathogenesis of EAE
  but not for the TH17 differentiation
caption: (A to F) Computation analysis of RNA-seq data obtained from GFP+/(IL-17A+)
  WT and RORγtK256R/K256R CD4+ T cells polarized under TH17 conditions. (A) The number
  of DEGs (black) including up-regulated (red) and down-regulated (blue) genes with
  a cutoff at P value of <0.05 and FC > 1.5. (B) Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA)
  canonical signaling pathway analysis of down-regulated pathways (z-score < 0) in
  RORγtK256R/K256R versus WT TH17 cells. The dots denote P value, the vertical dotted
  line marks P value of 0.05 (log10P = 1.3). JAK, Janus kinase; STAT, signal transducer
  and activator of transcription. (C to F) GSEA plots showing the enrichment of genes
  critical for TH17 differentiation (C), IL-23 signaling (D), glycolysis (E), and
  pathogenesis of TH17-mediated EAE (F) between RORγtK256R/K256R versus WT TH17 cells.
  NES, normalized enrichment score. Gene sets were derived from the molecular signaling
  database (MSigDB) for (C) to (E) and the previous report for (F) (). (G) ChIP-seq
  analysis of RORγt DNA-binding peaks at the Il17a and Il17f loci in RORγt−/− TH17
  cells expressing indicated RORγt. (H) Venn diagram of gene overlapping among 432
  down-regulated genes in RORγtK256R/K256R TH17 cells, 1277 genes with decreased RORγtK256R-binding
  activity, and 224 TH17 genes critical for the pathogenesis of EAE. (I) Protein-protein
  network analysis of differentially expressed regulators critical for the IL-23 signaling
  pathway between RORγtK256R/K256R versus WT TH17 cells. Genes critical for IL-23
  signaling pathway were customized on the basis of IPA-curated pathways.
