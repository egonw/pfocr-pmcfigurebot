caption: DLPC induced LRH-1 expression. (A) The mRNA levels of LRH-1 in granulosa
  cells by treatment with various concentrations of LRH-1 agonist (DLPC). (B) Western
  blotting of LRH-1 protein in granulosa cells by treatment with various concentrations
  of DLPC. (C) The protein levels of LRH-1 in the different groups. Data are expressed
  as the mean Â± SEM from three biological replicates. * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001, comparing
  the indicated groups.
