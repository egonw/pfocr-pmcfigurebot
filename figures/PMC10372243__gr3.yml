caption: Effects of oridonin on the cell cycle and cycle-related proteins of 4T1 cells.
  A and B. Graphical representation of the cell cycle distribution of 4T1 cells after
  treatment with oridonin. C. Western blot analysis of the expression of the S phase
  arrest-related proteins p53, p-p53, p21 and CDK2. Relative expression levels of
  p53, p-p53, p21 and CDK2 proteins (ns, no significant difference,**P < 0.01,***P < 0.001****P < 0.0001).
  D. Schematic diagram of oridonin-induced cell cycle arrest in S phase.

  and inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
