caption: The transcription levels (mean + SD) of (a, c) the monocyte chemoattractant
  protein‐1 (MCP‐1) and (b, d) interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) in the mares' endometrium in follicular
  (FLP) or mid‐luteal (MLP) phases of the oestrous cycle. The endometrial samples
  evaluated with respect to the intensity of inflammatory cell infiltrate (none, mild,
  moderate and severe) are shown in graphs a and b, and according to the type of inflammatory
  cell infiltration (macrophages, neutrophils, lymphocytes and mixed cells) or no
  cell infiltration detected (none) in c and d. Different letters indicate differences
  between groups for p < .05
article_title: The NF‐κB‐signalling pathway in mare's endometrium infiltrated with
  the inflammatory cells.
