caption: 'Effects of EPI on adriamycin‐induced nephropathy based on network pharmacology.
  CON: control. (A) The target genes of EPI in adriamycin‐induced nephropathy were
  identified by jvenn. (B) Core gene histogram of EPI for adriamycin nephropathy.
  (C) KEGG enrichment analysis of EPI in adriamycin nephropathy. (D) The relative
  expression levels of PI3K and AKT mRNA in kidney tissue were measured by RT‐qPCR.
  (E) Western blot detection of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway‐related protein levels.
  Data are expressed as the mean ± SD, n = 3 rats per group, *p < .05, **p < .01 compared
  with the ADR group. ADR, adriamycin‐induced nephropathy; EPI‐H, Epimedium sagittatum
  Maxim high dose group; EPI‐L, Epimedium sagittatum Maxim low dose; H&E, hematoxylin
  and eosin; mRNA, messenger RNA; PA, prednisone.'
article_title: Epimedium sagittatum Maxim ameliorates adriamycin‐induced nephropathy
  by restraining inflammation and apoptosis via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
