caption: Function and pathway enrichment analysis of differentially regulated genes
  in LPS‐induced ALI. (A) Gene set enrichment analysis and a signature of the up‐
  or downregulated genes between control and LPS groups. NES, normalized enrichment
  score; FDR, false discovery rate. (B) Heatmap (z‐scores rescaled to −1 to 1 as rainbow
  scale) showing the differentially expressed genes (fold change >1.5 and p value
  <0.05) in the Hippo signaling pathway. (C) KEGG pathway analysis showing differentially
  expressed genes that were identified between the control and LPS groups. (D) KEGG
  pathway analysis showing differentially expressed genes that were identified between
  the LPS and LPS + VER groups (fold change >1.5 and p value <0.05).
