  green box represents the positively identified metabolite that matched to both mzCloud
  and ChemSpider compound databases, the metabolite in the light green box represents
  the positively identified metabolite that matched to mzCloud or ChemSpider compound
  databases, the orange box represents the putatively identified metabolite, the blue
  box represents the metabolite which relates to this pathway (not found in this study)
  and the box plots of identified metabolites are displayed beside the corresponding
  metabolites. TP, Triphala extracts group; C, control group.
