caption: MAP9 expression increased in bladder cancer (BC) cells and was a negative
  factor for prognosis. (a) MAP9 protein levels in 50 paired BC and paracancerous
  tissues. (b) The overall survival rate of BC patients with higher and lower MAP9
  expression levels. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD), and
  Kaplan–Meier analysis was employed for survival analysis. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01,
  and ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
