caption: Metabolic pathway analysis plot. Color intensity (white to red) reflects
  increasing statistical significance, while circle diameter covaries with pathway
  impact. The graph was obtained by plotting on the y-axis the −log of p values from
  the pathway enrichment analysis and on the x-axis the pathway impact values derived
  from the pathway topology analysis. The metabolic pathways displaying the largest
  differences in ASD vs. typically-developing siblings mainly corresponded to “phenylalanine-tyrosine-and-tryptophan
  metabolism”, “phenylalanine metabolism”, “purine metabolism”, and “glutathione metabolism”.
