caption: 'RNase 7 downregulated the expression of proteins associated with the JAK/STAT
  signaling pathway and inflammation in UPEC-infected bladder cells in a high-glucose
  environment. SV-HUC-1 cells were pretreated with different concentrations of RNase
  7 (1, 5, and 25 μg/mL) and 15 mM glucose for 24 h and then infected with UPEC. Total
  protein from all the cell groups was collected for detection. (A) Total protein
  expression of JAK1, JAK2, STAT1, STAT3, phosphorylated-STAT1/STAT3, and the inhibitor,
  SOCS3, TLR4, IL-6, and IFN-γ were analyzed using Western blotting. (B) All data
  were normalized to the internal reference β-actin. Results were assessed using a
  densitometer and quantified using ImageJ software (NIH). The definitions of each
  letter/number represented by the X axis are: C: control; U: UPEC infection alone;
  G: with 15 mM glucose pretreatment alone; 1, 5, and 25: pretreated with 1, 5, and
  25 μg/mL RNase 7, respectively, + 15 mM glucose. The results are presented as mean
  ± SD of three independent experiments. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, ****
  p < 0.0001, compared to the respective positive control group (U). # p < 0.05, ##
  p < 0.01, ### p < 0.001, #### p < 0.0001, compared between the two groups.'
