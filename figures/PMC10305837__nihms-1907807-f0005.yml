figure_title: CNX-774 shows drug interactions across a panel of cytotoxic nucleoside
  analog drugs identical to that of ENT1 inhibitor NBMPR
caption: A) Schematic illustrating nucleoside salvage pathway with candidate CNX-774
  targets highlighted. B-H) Dose-response of indicated cytotoxic nucleoside analog
  drugs in the presence (red line) or absence (black line) of CNX-774 (B-D) or ENT1
  inhibitor NBMPR (F-H) along with cartoon showing activation pathway for each nucleoside
  analog drug. Data represent mean +/− SEM of three biological replicates. E) Relative
  mRNA expression for indicated genes in S2–013 cells assessed by real time quantitative
  PCR after 72 hour treatment with BQ (10μM) or vehicle. Data represent mean +/− SD
  of four replicates. N.D. stands for not detected. I) Table of drug interactions
  of CNX-774 and NBMPR across a panel of nucleoside analog drugs. Red indicates antagonism,
  blue indicates cooperativity, black indicates no interaction. Dose response experiments
  for other drugs in table shown in .
