caption: 'Escin stimulated the mRNA expression of Wnt target genes and Wnt receptors.
  (a) The mRNA expression of CCND1, Myc and Dkk1 was evaluated in hDPCs treated with
  escin for 24 h and (b) the mRNA expression of Wnt receptors, including Fzd3, Fzd4,
  Fzd5 and Fzd7, was evaluated in hDPCs treated with escin for 24 h (n = 5). N.S:
  not significant, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 compared to the non-treated control. Data
  are expressed as mean ± SD.'
