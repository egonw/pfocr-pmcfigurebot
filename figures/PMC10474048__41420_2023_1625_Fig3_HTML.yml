figure_title: Overexpression of KIF15 promoted prostate cancer development in vitro
caption: The overexpression efficiencies of KIF15 in DU 145 and PC-3 cells were detected
  by qPCR (A) and western blot analysis (B). C CCK8 assay was used to detect cell
  proliferation of DU 145 and PC-3 cells in Control and KIF15 groups with time from
  24 h to 120 h. D After lentivirus infection of DU 145 cells and PC-3 cells, the
  number of colonies of the KIF15 group and Control group was counted and compared
  during 7 days of culturing. E 5 days after lentivirus infection, the apoptotic cell
  percentage of the KIF15 group and Control group was detected by flow cytometry.
  F Cell motility of DU 145 and PC-3 cells with or without KIF15 overexpression was
  detected by Transwell assay. Moreover, KIF15 knockdown cell models were transfected
  with KIF15 overexpression lentivirus for recovering KIF15 expression, which was
  subjected to the detection of cell proliferation (G) and cell apoptosis (H). Data
  were shown as Mean with SD. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
