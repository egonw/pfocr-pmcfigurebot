caption: Effect of PBE on the expression of osteoclastogenesis-related genes. BMMs
  were cultured with RANKL (100 ng/mL) and M-CSF (30 ng/mL) in the absence or presence
  of PBE (50 μg/mL) for 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 days. The expression of genes (Acp5 (TRAP),
  Oscar, CTSK (cathepsin K), Tm7sf4 (dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein,
  DC-STAMP), Atp6v0d2, and NFATc1) involved in osteoclast differentiation was evaluated
  by qRT-PCR. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and the error bars represent
  the standard deviation. Significant differences between the PBE and control groups
  are indicated (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.005; *** p < 0.001).
