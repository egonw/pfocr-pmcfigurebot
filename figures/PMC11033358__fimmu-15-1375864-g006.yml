caption: Clinical samples verified differences in phenotype and function between Notch1+CD8+T
  cells and Notch1-CD8+T cells. (A) Immunofluorescence and statistical graph of HCC
  tissues. (B) Immunohistochemical and statistical graph of DLL4 in tumor and paratumor
  tissues. The exhaustion phenotype (C) and function (D) of CD8+T cells in peripheral
  blood of HCC patients were analyzed by flow cytometry. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01;
  ***, p<0.001.
