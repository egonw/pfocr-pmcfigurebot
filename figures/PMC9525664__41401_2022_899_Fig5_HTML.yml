figure_title: IMM-H007 directly interacts with TGFβ1, inhibits binding to its receptor,
  and attenuates its downstream signaling
caption: 'a SPR analysis of the binding between IMM-H007 and TGFβ1. Recombinant TGFβ1
  protein was immobilized on an activated CM5 sensor chip, and IMM-H007 was then flowed
  across the chip. b Overlay plots of SPR sensorgrams depicting the binding of IMM-H007
  to TGFβ1 and the inhibitory effect on binding between TGFβ1 and TβR2 (IMM-H007 concentration:
  6 µmol·L−1). c, d IMM-H007 and TGFβ1 (0.5 ng·mL−1) were premixed for 2 h, and CFs
  were subsequently treated with this mixture for 24 h. Western blot analysis and
  quantification of phosphorylated Smad2/3, Smad2/3, and GAPDH were performed. n = 6;
  *P < 0.05; ***P < 0.001. One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test. SPR surface plasmon
  resonance, TGFβ1 transforming growth factor β1, TβR2 transforming growth factor
  β1 receptor II, IMM IMM-H007, CF cardiac fibroblast.'
