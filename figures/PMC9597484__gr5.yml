caption: Effects of KRG and saponin on mRNA and protein levels of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines (IL-6/8) against DEP exposure. (A, B) KRG, saponin, and dexamethasone
  significantly inhibited DEP-induced mRNA expression and protein production of IL-6/8.
  Bars represent the means  SD of three separate experiments conducted in triplicate.
  ∗p < 0.05 compared to the control, †p < 0.05 compared to DEP (20 μg/ml). DEP, diesel
  exhaust particles; Dexa, dexamethasone; KRG, Korean Red Ginseng; SD, standard deviation.
article_title: Saponin attenuates diesel exhaust particle (DEP)-induced MUC5AC expression
  and pro-inflammatory cytokine upregulation via TLR4/TRIF/NF-κB signaling pathway
  in airway epithelium and ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized mice.
