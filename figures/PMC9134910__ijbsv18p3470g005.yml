caption: Histone lactylation enhances tumor proliferation and migration largely dependent
  on PDGFRβ pathway. (A) Representative flow cytometry histogram of PDGFRβ in ccRCC
  cells with or without PDGFRβ overexpression. Cells were treated with 8mM oxamate
  for 24 h. Overexpressing PDGFRβ restored the oxamate-induced down-regulation of
  PDGFRβ. (B) Quantification of relative PDGFRβ MFI in 786-O (left panel) and A498
  (right panel) cells with or without PDGFRβ overexpression treated with oxamate.
  (C, D) CCK-8 assay showing the proliferation ability of 786-O (C) and A498 (D) cells
  with or without PDGFRβ overexpression treated with oxamate. (E) Transwell assay
  showing the migration ability of 786-O and A498 cells with or without PDGFRβ overexpression
  treated with oxamate. (F) Quantification of relative PDGFRβ MFI in Caki-1 cells
  with or without PDGFRβ knockdown. Cells were treated with 5mM lactate for 24 h.
  PDGFRβ knockdown inhibited the lactate-induced up-regulation of PDGFRβ. (G) CCK-8
  assay showing the proliferation ability of Caki-1 cells with or without PDGFRβ knockdown
  treated with lactate. (H) Transwell assay showing the migration ability of Caki-1
  cells with or without PDGFRβ knockdown treated with lactate. Data are presented
  as mean ± SD. **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, by 1-way ANOVA (B, C, D, E, F, G, H). oe, overexpression.
