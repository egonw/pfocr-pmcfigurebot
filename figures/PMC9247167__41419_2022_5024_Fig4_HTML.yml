figure_title: Silencing Gal-1 reverses the Warburg effect and induces apoptosis
caption: A Cellular ATP in SV and shGal-1 stable cells in GSC20 and GSC33 cell lines.
  B DCFDA staining was used to determine ROS levels in SV and shGal-1 treatments in
  both GSC20 and GSC33. C BrdU assay to verify the cell viability in both SV and shGal-1
  cells. D Limiting dilution assays to study the GSC proliferation in SV and shGal-1-treated
  GSC20 and GSC33 cells. Each result is representative of three independent experiments.
  E Immunoblot analysis of different glycolytic enzymes in SV and shGal-1-stable cells
  of GSC33 and GSC20. F GSC20 and GSC33 were analyzed for Annexin V/APC and PI-induced
  apoptosis following manipulation of shGal-1. Dot plots (Red dots) and bar graphs
  represent the percentage of healthy, necrotic, early apoptotic, and late apoptotic
  cells in GSC20 and GSC33 cells. These data were compared with those in the control
  group. G Human apoptosis signaling pathway array (Ray Biotech AAH-APOSIG), to verify
  the induction of apoptosis in the shGal-1-stable cells when compared to the SV in
  GSC20. H Immunoblot analysis of various apoptosis markers in shGal-1-stable cells.
