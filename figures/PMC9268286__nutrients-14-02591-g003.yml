caption: 'TXNIP inhibitor (Resveratrol) alleviates pancreatic necrosis, systemic inflammation
  and oxidative stress in L-arginine-induced acute pancreatitis without changes in
  GSDMD. (a) The experimental schedule. (b–d) The levels of amylase (b), lipase (c)
  and LDH (d) in serum were detected (n = 3). (e) The levels of IL-1β in pancreas
  tissues were detected (n = 3). (f) The general morphology of the pancreas was observed.
  (gi–giv) Representative H&E images and histopathological scores of the pancreas
  in L-arginine-acute pancreatitis (n = 5). Scale bars, 100 μm. (hi,hii) Representative
  immunofluorescence staining of GSDMD (red), CALNEXIN (green) and DAPI (dark blue)
  in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded of pancreas tissues and pearson’s correlation
  coefficient of GSDMD and CALNEXIN (n = 5). Scale bars, 100 μm. (ii,iii,ji,jii) Representative
  immunofluorescence staining of TXNIP, HIF-1α (red) and DAPI (dark blue) in formalin-fixed
  paraffin-embedded of pancreas tissues (n = 5). Scale bars, 100 μm. All values were
  shown as the mean ± SEM. # p < 0.05 compared with control group, * p < 0.05, **
  p < 0.01 compared with mice acute pancreatitis model groups. Unpaired Student’s
  t-tests were used in (b–e,gii–giv,hii,iii,jii). Resveratrol represents RES.'
