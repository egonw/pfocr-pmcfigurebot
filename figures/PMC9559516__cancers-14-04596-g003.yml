caption: Crosstalk Between RKIP and N-cadherin. RKIP inhibits the MEK/ERK signaling
  pathway by interrupting the interaction between Raf and MEK, stopping the progression
  of the signal through the pathway. Snail is regulated downstream of the MEK/ERK
  pathway, upregulated through MEK/ERK signaling. Snail cannot promote N-cadherin
  production without MEK/ERK signaling, showing RKIP as an antagonist to N-cadherin
  expression. In addition, RKIP binds to Notch1, blocking the cleavage of NICD. NICD
  is then unable to locate to the nucleus to induce the transcription of N-cadherin.
