caption: Effect of dietary supplementation of sodium acetate (NaAc) on milk fat synthesis
  and mTORC1 signaling in mice. (A) Milk in pups born by mothers, n = 3. (B) Offspring
  weight on d 7 of lactation, n = 7. (C) Milk fat content on d 7 of lactation, n = 7.
  (D) Dam baby weight on d 7 of lactation, n = 7. (E) Dam feed intake during lactation,
  n = 7. (F) Prolactin content in plasma of mice on d 7 of lactation, n = 7. (G,H)
  Relative expression abundance of proteins related to milk fat synthesis in mammary
  gland tissue, n = 3. (I) Relative mRNA expression abundance of target genes, n = 3.
  (J,K) Relative expression abundance of proteins related to GPCR and mTORC1 signaling
  pathways in mammary gland tissue, n = 3. All data with error bars are averages ±
  SEM. In histograms, no letter or the same letter above the bar graph indicates no
  significant difference (p > 0.05), and different letters indicate a significant
  difference (p < 0.05).
