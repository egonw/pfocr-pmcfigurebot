caption: Pathway activation and gene mutations among NAG groups were revealed. (a)
  Different metabolic pathways between high and low NAGs groups; the significant activation
  pathways were marked with purple and green. (b) Different gene alterations between
  the two groups, and different spectral color represent different types of genetic
  mutation. (c) Correlations between NAGs and the steps of the cancer immunity cycle
  and correlations between NAGs and the enrichment scores of immunotherapy-predicted
  pathways. The dashed lines represent a negative correlation, and the solid lines
  represent a positive correlation.
