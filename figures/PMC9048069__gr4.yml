caption: BTC is overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma(A) BTC expression was analyzed
  by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using a US BioMax tissue microarray (BS04081a), consisting
  of LUAD (60 cores) and normal lung tissues (3 cores). Representative normal lung
  and LUAD images at 4× and 20× magnifications are shown.(B) Average BTC staining
  intensity in normal lung versus LUAD tissues (BS04081a) is plotted.(C) BTC expression
  was analyzed by IHC using a US BioMax tissue microarray (HLugA180Su03) consisting
  of LUAD (n = 89) and normal adjacent lung tissues (n = 82). Representative LUAD
  images at 4× and 20× magnifications are shown.(D) Average BTC staining intensity
  in normal lung versus LUAD (HLugA180Su03) is plotted.(E) BTC expression was analyzed
  by IHC using the Yale University TMA (YTMA-310) consisting of LUAD tumors bearing
  mutations with KRAS-mutant(n = 41), EGFR-mutant(n = 27), and KRAS/EGFR wild-type(n
  = 57) LUAD samples. Representative LUAD images at 10× and 20× magnifications are
  shown.(F) Relative BTC staining intensity in normal lung versus LUAD (YTMA310) is
  plotted. Data are shown as the mean ± SEM, ∗∗∗p<0.001, ∗∗∗∗p<0.0001. See also ,
