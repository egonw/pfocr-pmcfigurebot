caption: Related mRNA expression levels in the mice brain and kidney of all groups.
  (a–c) AhR, NF-κB, and JNK mRNA expression levels in the mice kidney. (d–h) AhR,
  NF-κB, JNK, BDNF, and TrkB mRNA expression levels in the mice brain (Δp < 0.01,
  comparable to the S group; ∗∗p < 0.01, comparable to the M group; ∗p < 0.05, comparable
  to the M group; S, sham operation group; M, model group; P, positive control group;
  MDFD-H, modified Dahuang Fuzi Decoction high-dose group; MDFD-M, modified Dahuang
  Fuzi Decoction medium-dose group; MDFD-L, modified Dahuang Fuzi Decoction low-dose
  group; AhR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor;
  TrkB, tropomyosin receptor kinase B; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal
  kinase).
