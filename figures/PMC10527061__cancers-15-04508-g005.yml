caption: 'ZFP64 recruits HDAC1 to deacetylate and delactylate the promoter region
  of NUMB to suppress it. (A) Model diagram of the predicted ZFP64 binding NUMB promoter
  region. Arrow: the direction of transcription. (B,C) The direct interaction between
  ZFP64 and NUMB promoter region was detected using ChIP-qPCR in GBC-SD and NOZ cells.
  (D,E) The mRNA expression levels of NUMB in GBC cells overexpressing or knocking
  down ZFP64 was detected using RT-qPCR assays. (F) The protein expression levels
  of NUMB in GBC cells overexpressing or knocking down ZFP64 was detected using Western
  blot assays. (G) The direct interaction between ZFP64 and HDAC1 was confirmed using
  Co-IP assays and Western blot analysis. (H–K) The H3K18lac levels (H,I) and the
  H4K77ac level (J,K) in the NUMB promoter region of GBC-SD and NOZ cells with ZFP64
  overexpression or knockdown were detected using ChIP-qPCR assays. Ns: no statistically
  significance. All data were assessed using unpaired Student’s t test or one-way
  ANOVA, as mean ± SD, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001. See  for original western
  blots.'
