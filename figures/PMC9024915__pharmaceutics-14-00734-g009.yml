caption: Scheme of genetically edited cell membrane-coated magnetic nanoparticles
  (gCM-MNs) elicit potent macrophage immune responses for cancer immunotherapy. (a)
  Cell membranes were isolated from the genetically engineered cells, overexpressing
  SIRPα variants and then coated onto magnetic nanoparticles (MNs); (b) under external
  magnetic field, gCM-MNs efficiently accumulate in the tumor microenvironment, block
  the CD47-SIRPα “don’t eat me” pathway, and repolarize TAMs towards M1 phenotype,
  promoting macrophage phagocytosis of cancer cells as well as boosting antitumor
  T-cell immunity. Reprinted with permission from Ref. []. Copyright 2020 John Willey
