caption: Enhanced repressive histone trimethylation and down-regulation of MYC signaling
  in the mdig KO cells(A) Average plots of the merged peaks of ChIP-seq for H3K9me3,
  H3K36me3 and H4K20me3 in the regions from -2 kb to 2 kb of gene loci in WT and mdig
  KO cells. Right panel shows heatmaps of the merged peak distribution of H3K9me3
  and H4K20me3 between WT and mdig KO cells.(B) Transcription factor pathway analysis
  using Enrichr TF Perturbations Followed by Expression for the 980 downregulated
  proteins in the mdig KO MDA-MB-231 cells.(C) Histone trimethylation profiles of
  the selected MYC pathway genes in both WT and mdig KO cells. Block arrowheads depict
  the enhanced enrichment of the repressive histone trimethylation markers on the
  indicated genes in KO cells. Empty arrowheads indicate diminished active histone
  trimethylation markers in the indicated gene in WT and KO cells.
