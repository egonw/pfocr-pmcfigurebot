caption: 'Adropin inhibits STAT3 entry into the nucleus in osteogenic differentiated
  VSMCs in vitro. (a, b) The entry of STAT3 into the nucleus of VSMCs was evaluated
  using western blotting. GAPDH was used as the loading control. Each experiment was
  performed three times and data are presented as the mean ± SD. STAT3: signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3; VSMCs: vascular smooth muscle cells. ∗p < 0.05
  compared to control. #p < 0.05 compared to the Cacl2 group.'
