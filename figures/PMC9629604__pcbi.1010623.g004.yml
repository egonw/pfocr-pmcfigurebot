figure_title: Model temporal dynamics and cell population data
caption: 'A: Cell population data describing the temporal dynamics of phosphorylated
  JAK1, pSTAT1 and nuclear IRF9. Experimental data describe quantitative immunoblotting
  measurements in Huh7.5 cells after stimulation with 500 UI/mL of IFN-Î± at different
  time points for a total time of 180 min []. Measurement error of 18% is represented
  in the figures as error bars. Model dynamics were obtained by repeating the stochastic
  simulation 1,000 times, each trajectory representing a single cell. The procedure
  for mapping the model variables and experimental data is given in Section C.1 in
  . B: Time courses data describing the temporal dynamics of all species involved
  in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. The plots represent the repetitions of the stochastic
  model. The y-axis has units of Molecules per Cell (M/C). Orange lines represent
  the median, while light gray display the range of values and dark gray ribbons contain
  50% of the values. The ribbons may not be visible if there is almost no variation
  (e.g. IFN) or if there is no particle present for the majority of trajectories (e.g.
  mIRF9n).'
