caption: Anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase (PAT1) catalyzes the second step in
  Trp biosynthesis. Phosphoenol pyruvate from glycolysis and erythrose 4-phosphate
  from the Calvin-Benson cycle are shuttled through the shikimate pathway to generate
  the precursor of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis, chorismate. Chorismate is then
  converted to anthranilate, which is phosphoribosylated by PAT1 in the second step
  of the five-step Trp pathway.
