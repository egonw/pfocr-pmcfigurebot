caption: (A) Mechanism of action of cisplatin. Modern studies have revealed that copper
  transporter protein CTR1 is responsible for cisplatin uptake. Cisplatin activates
  both the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway and the extrinsic death receptor pathway
  of apoptosis. In addition, ER stress may also be induced. Among the three pathways,
  the intrinsic pathway, involving the mitochondria, is the major one. The administration
  of cisplatin causes cellular stress and results in the alteration of the mitochondrial
  membrane, leading to the release of apoptogenic factors such as apoptosis‐inducing
  factor (AIF), endonuclease G and cytochrome C, from the mitochondria into the cytosol.
  After being released from the mitochondria, endonuclease G and AIF accumulate in
  the nucleus, leading to apoptosis in a caspase‐independent manner while the released
  cytochrome C binds to the adaptor protein Apaf‐1 and induces its conformational
  changes, activating caspase 9, which, in turn, leads to activation of several downstream
  caspases for caspase‐dependent apoptosis. The ER‐stress pathway is also involved
  in apoptosis during cisplatin administration. Caspase 12, which localizes at the
  cytosolic face of the ER and is activated by ER stress, is the key initiator caspase
  in the ER pathway and in the extrinsic pathway. Binding of the death receptors by
  ligands results in the recruitment and activation of caspase 8, which leads to the
  activation of downstream caspases to trigger apoptosis. Furthermore, cisplatin induces
  oxidative stress by triggering the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such
  as hydroxyl radical and, superoxides, which depends on the concentration of cisplatin
  and time of exposure. ROS are thought to be responsible for peroxidation of lipids,
  depletion of sulfhydryl groups, and alterations in various signal transduction pathways,
  which can cause DNA damage and consequently apoptosis of cells. Although cisplatin
  can bind to various biomolecules, it is generally considered that DNA is the major
  biological target, forming adducts. Adapted from ‘Apoptosis Extrinsic and Intrinsic

  (B) Platin drugs in the general process of metastasis. Cisplatin induces the expression
  of the transcription regulation factor ATF3, which suppresses a variety of genes
  related to the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton, the extracellular matrix, filopodia,
  and cell adhesion, including TGFβ/SMAD3 signaling and the β‐catenin signaling pathway
  (and consequently compromises MET), and cell migration in vitro and cancer metastasis
  in vivo. Similarly, PIP platinum can increase cell adhesion and block cell migration/invasion
  by inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway due to nuclear translocation of β‐catenin
  (which is necessary for the activation of Wnt signaling) and inducing the translocation
  of β‐catenin in the cell membrane, which favors cell adhesion through E‐Cadherin.
