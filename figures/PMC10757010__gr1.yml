caption: Experiments design of DNFB inducing AD-like lesion in Wistar Rat. In order
  to induce AD-like skin lesions, which the DNFB (1 %) was topically applied to the
  dorsal skin (has been shaved) of Wistar rat for 4 weeks (day 28). The Rats were
  treated with cetirizine (0.65 mg/kg/day) or JPYXQFC (7.2 g/kg/day, 14.4 g/kg/day,
  28.8 g/kg/day). Pretreated the cetirizine and JPYXQFC groups with cetirizine and
  JPYXQFC (different concentration) before 3 days. After 28 days, collected the venous
