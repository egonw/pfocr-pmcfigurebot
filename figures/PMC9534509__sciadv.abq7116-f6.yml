figure_title: The scaffolds induce bone formation ectopically by cAMP/PKA-activated
  BMSCs
caption: (A) Schematic illustration of the implanted scaffolds loaded with BMSCs treated
  with different inhibitors. (B) Histological analysis for new bone formation within
  the scaffold at day 90 postoperatively (M, material; B, blood vessel; NB, newly
  formed bone). (C) Immunohistochemical staining for the osteogenic marker OCN (brown,
  black arrow). (D) Schematic diagram of the molecular mechanism for BMSCs osteogenic
  differentiation induced by the PEKK-B scaffold (error bars, means ± SD; n = 5 per
  group; all analyses were done using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test). **P
  < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001.
