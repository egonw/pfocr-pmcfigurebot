caption: NSC49L treatment increases the colocalization of eIF4E with unphosphorylated
  4EBP1 and inhibits p21 protein synthesis in FOLFOX-HT29 cells(A) IHC analysis. FOLFOX-HT29
  cells were treated with 20 μM of NSC49L for 24 h. After treatment, the colocalization
  of eIF4E and 4EBP1 was determined by IHC. Yellow color in the merge column shows
  the colocalization of these two proteins. Images were captured with a Nikon A1RMPsi-STORM4.0
  confocal microscope (Melville, NY) at 60× magnification.(B) Global protein synthesis.
  FOLFOX HT29 cells were treated as above with 20 μM of NSC49L for 24 h. Cells were
  treated with 10 μg/mL of puromycin or puromycin plus 10 μg/mL of CHX for 15 min.
  Cells were washed and incubated in a fresh medium without drugs for an additional
  2 h. Samples were blotted with anti-puromycin antibody.(C) Validate the experimental
  conditions, a concentration-dependent effect on p21 expression was performed. Cells
  were mock treated (control) or treated with 10 and 20 μM of NSC49L for 24 h and
  p21 level was determined.(D) Evaluate the effect of NSC49L on the regulation of
  p21 biosynthesis, we set up the experiment as in B. To determine the incorporation
  of puromycin into nascent p21, the pre-immunoprecipitated lysate was subjected to
  anti-puromycin immunoblot.(E) Quantitative analysis of the blot shown in panel D,
  which is presented as the ImageJ arbitrary units. Data are Mean ± SE of three experiments.
  The p-value is shown on the top of the graph.(F) β-actin was used as an internal
  control for equal loading. See also .
