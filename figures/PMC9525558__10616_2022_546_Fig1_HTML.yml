caption: 'Salinomycin treatment inhibited T24 cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis
  and oxidative stress. A T24 cells were treated with different concentrations of
  salinomycin for 48 h and cell viability was detected by the CCK-8 assay, B and C
  CCK-8 assays and Edu staining were used to assess the effect on cell proliferation
  (red indicates an Edu-positive signal and blue indicates nuclei stained with DAPI),
  D Apoptosis was detected by Tunel staining (red indicates a Tunel-positive signal
  and blue indicates nuclei stained with DAPI), E The expression of apoptosis-related
  proteins was detected by western blotting, F The levels of SOD and MDA were detected
  by ELISA; G: KDM1A expression was evaluated by western blotting. ** P < 0.01, ***
  P < 0.001, vs. Control; #, P < 0.05, ##, P < 0.01, ###, P < 0.001, vs. 0.5 μM salinomycin;
