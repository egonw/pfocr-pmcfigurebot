caption: 'A: Probable way of DPT tumor suppression. B, C, and D: Theoretical possibilities
  for DPT overexpression in colorectal cancer. A primary increase in DPT may induce
  tumor aggressiveness through the TGF-β signaling pathway (B). High levels of TGF-β
  may lead to DPT overexpression (C). Diminished activity of the TGF-β pathway in
  the cell may induce DPT overexpression to restore the pathway (D)'
article_title: Non-collagenous extracellular matrix protein dermatopontin may play
  a role as another component of transforming growth factor-β signaling pathway in
  colon carcinogenesis.
