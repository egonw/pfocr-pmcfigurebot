caption: 'Administration of Fn1 inhibitor attenuated I/R-induced cardiac inflammation,
  oxidative stress, and fibrosis. (a) Immunohistochemical staining of myocardial sections
  with anti-Mac-2 antibody (left), and quantification of Mac-2-positive macrophages
  (right, n = 5). (b) DHE (bottom) staining of myocardial sections (left), and quantification
  of the ROS level (right, n = 5). (c) Masson trichrome''s staining of myocardial
  sections (left), and quantification of the relative fibrotic area (right, n = 5).
  (d) Measurement of 8-OHdG level in the heart (n = 5). (e) qPCR analysis of the mRNA
  levels of collagen I and collagen III in the heart (n = 6). (f) Immunoblotting analysis
  of the protein levels of TGF-β1, p-P65, and P65 (left) and quantification of the
  relative protein levels (right, n = 4 per group). GAPDH as an internal control.
  Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. ∗∗∗P < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001 versus the sham-operated
  group; ##P < 0.01; ###P < 0.001, ####P < 0.0001 versus saline I/R 24 h; &&P < 0.01;
  &&&P < 0.001, &&&&P < 0.0001 versus saline I/R 72 h.'
