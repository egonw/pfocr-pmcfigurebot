caption: Effect of NSCLC CSC cells on OC activity and T-cell proliferation. (A) Bars
  indicate the activity of OCs, expressed as mean area of resorption ± SD. The presence
  of H3122 and, above all, of A549 NSCLC CSC spheres stimulates OCs, p < 0.05, while
  H2228s inhibit OC activity. (B) The release of TRAP by OCs was slightly increased
  in the presence of NSCLC spheres. (C) The assay measured the effect of the conditioned
  medium, derived from the different culture conditions, on T-cell proliferation,
  unstimulated and stimulated with anti-CD3 (OKT3) and anti-CD28 antibodies for 72
  h. CTRL indicates T-cell proliferation in RPMI 1% FBS, SCM is the stem MTT cell
  medium. Data are represented as mean value ± SD of four independent experiments
  from each cell line. * indicates the significance compared to the CTRL calculated
  by one-way Anova analysis.
