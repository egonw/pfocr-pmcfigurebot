caption: RNASEH1‐AS1 deficiency inhibits tumor growth in vivo. (A) Transfection efficiency
  of sh‐RNASEH1‐AS1. (B) Typical images of tumor xenografts are shown. (C) The growth
  curves of tumor xenografts. (D) The weight of tumor xenografts. (E, F) RNASEH1‐AS1
  and miR‐516a‐5p expression in tumor xenografts. (G) Immunohistochemistry was used
  to analyze FOXK1, Ki‐67, N‐cadherin, Vimentin, E‐cadherin, and cleaved Caspase‐3
  expression in tumor xenografts. (H) The protein levels of FOXK1, β‐catenin, cyclin
  D1, and c‐Myc in tumor xenografts. **p<0.01
article_title: Long noncoding RNASEH1‐AS1 exacerbates the progression of non‐small
  cell lung cancer by acting as a ceRNA to regulate microRNA‐516a‐5p/FOXK1 and thereby
  activating the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway.
