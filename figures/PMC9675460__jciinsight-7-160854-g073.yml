figure_title: HFD during puberty mitigated β cell proliferation and GH/5-HT pathway
  hormone levels and gene expression, and it reduced β cell mass in adulthood
caption: (A) β Cell proliferation and mass, plasma hormone and islet gene expression,
  and 5-HT content were assessed in male rats fed a HFD (HFD, red) or a chow diet
  (CHOW, black) from 4 to 8 wk of age followed by a switch to a chow diet for both
  groups (HFD-CHOW, red; CHOW-CHOW, black) until 12 wk of age. (B and C) β Cell proliferation
  was assessed at 5 (B) (n = 3) and 8 (C) (n = 7–8) wk of age by immunofluorescent
  staining of pancreatic sections for MKI67 and insulin (INS) and presented as the
  percentage of MKI67+INS+ cells over INS+ cells. (D and E) Body weight (D) and β
  cell mass per 100 g of body weight (E) at 12 wk of age (n = 8–10). (F) Ghr, Tph1,
  Htr1d, and Htr2b mRNA levels in islets isolated from rats at 5 wk of age (n = 3–6).
  mRNA was quantified by RT-PCR and normalized to cyclophilin (Ppia). Data are presented
  as the fold change over the CHOW diet group. (G–I) Plasma GH (G) and IGF1 (H) levels
  and islet 5-HT content normalized to total protein (I) in rats at 8 wk of age (n
  = 6-7). Data represented individual values and are expressed as mean ± SEM. *P <
  0.05, **P < 0.01 following unpaired Student’s t test as compared with the control
  CHOW or CHOW-CHOW group.
