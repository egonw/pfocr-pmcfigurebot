caption: Metabolic pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes identified in
  the transcriptome. (A) Bubble diagram analysis of differentially gene expressions
  in metabolic pathway. (B) Volcano map of differentially expressed genes. Data are
  normalized and transformed of gene expression in zebra-green striped leaves and
  zebra-yellow striped leaves (n = 3). The red arrow points to the Carotenoid biosynthesis,
  and the black arrow points to the ZEP.
