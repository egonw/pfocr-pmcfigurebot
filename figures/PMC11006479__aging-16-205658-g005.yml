caption: Parthanatos-based clustering analysis. (A) Define a consensus matrix heat
  map of k = 2 clusters and their associated regions. (B) Cumulative distribution
  function (CDF) curve under different cluster number. (C) The relative change in
  area under the CDF curve for different values of k. (D) The violin plot shows enrichment
  scores for two clusters (C1 and C2), p<0.001. (E) Survival curves of C1 and C2 clusters,
  purple for C1, green for C2. (F) Expression difference of parthanatos-related genes
  between CI and C2 subtypes. (G) Differences in the activity of metabolic pathways
  between CI and C2 subtypes. (H) Differences in immune pathway activity between CI
  and C2 subtypes.
