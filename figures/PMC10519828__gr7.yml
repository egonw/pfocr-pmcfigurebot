caption: PKCδ-depleted cells are dependent on the pentose phosphate pathway and glutamine
  for radioprotection. Par-C5 cells depleted of PKCδ (shδ110) or untargeted control
  shRNA (shNT) were pretreated with DMSO or with indicated inhibitors for 24 h prior
  to treatment with 10 Gy IR. Cells were harvested 24 h following IR and measured
  for caspase 3 activity. A, 12.5 mM 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG). B, 50 μM 6-aminonicotinamide
  (6-AN), C, 500 μM CB-839. Statistics represent 2-way ANOVA, error bars are SEM,
  and ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001. IR, irradiation; PKCδ,
  protein kinase Cδ.
