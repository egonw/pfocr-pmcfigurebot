caption: 'DEPDC1-AS1 knockdown promoted HGC-27 cell tumorigenesis in vivo. Empty vector
  or sh-DEPDC1-AS1 were transfected into HGC-27 cells and subcutaneously injected
  into nude mice. (a) Tumor volumes were measured every 3 days post-injection. (b)
  Tumors were isolated and photographed. (c) Tumor weights were measured at the end
  of the experiment. (d) RT-qPCR analysis of DEPDC1-AS1 expression in tumors. (e,
  f) Immunostaining of the proliferation index factor Ki67 in tumor sections. Scale
  bar: 50 µm. For (a) to (f), n = 6 for each group. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.DEPDC1 antisense
  RNA 1, DEPDC1-AS1; sh, short hairpin; RT-qPCR, quantitative reverse transcription
  polymerase chain reaction.'
