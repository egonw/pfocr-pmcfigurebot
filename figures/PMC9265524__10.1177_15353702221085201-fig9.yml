caption: KEGG pathway annotation analysis. (A) Ubiquitin proteasome signaling pathway
  was the most significantly changed pathway for control versus MV groups. (B) Fatty
  acid degradation signaling pathway was the most significantly changed pathway for
  PNS versus MV groups. (A color version of this figure is available in the online
  journal.)
