caption: Schematic illustration of generating Abcb1 KO MDCK (gMDCK) cells and ABCB1/ABCG2
  overexpressing gMDCK cells. After transfection, the target sequence is recognised
  and cleaved by the sgRNA-Cas9 complex, followed by the integration of the donor
  template through the HDR repair pathway. The expression of Abcb1 is thus disrupted
  in Abcb1 KO MDCK (gMDCK) cells. To generate ABCB1/ABCG2 overexpressing gMDCK cells,
  plasmids encoding human ABCB1 or ABCG2 genes are delivered into gMDCK cells and
  randomly integrated into the genome, leading to constant overexpression of ABCB1
  or ABCG2 protein. Created with BioRender.com.
