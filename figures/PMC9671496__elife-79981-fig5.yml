figure_title: Mycolic acids are required for CL31 infection
caption: (A) Cartoon of the mycolic acid synthesis pathway. Proteins outlined in burgundy
  were enriched for transposon insertions following CL31 challenge. (1) Long-chain
  fatty acids are synthesized by FadD2 and the acyl-CoA carboxylase complex (ACC),
  including PccB, for condensation by Pks. Concurrently, (2) OtsAB synthesizes trehalose
  from UDP-glucose (UDP-G) and glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P). (3) The mycolic acid is
  attached to trehalose to form trehalose monomycolate (TMM) that is acetylated and
  reduced before (4) being transported across the membrane by the transporters CmpL1
  and CmpL4. Once in the periplasm, (5) TMM is then used as a substrate of the corynemycoloyltransferases
  (CMTs), including Cmt1, to transfer the mycolate moieties to the arabinogalactan
  or proteins. (B) Transposon sequencing (Tn-Seq) insertion profile for a locus encoding
  core mycolic acid synthesis genes. (C) Validation of the Tn-Seq results for ostA.
  Ten-fold serial dilutions of lysates for the indicated phages were prepared and
  3 ÂµL of each dilution were spotted on a lawn of the indicated host strain.
