  mouse models
caption: 'The Gli1-CreERT2;NuTRAP and the Shh-CreERT2;NuTRAP mice were treated with
  tamoxifen to activate the EGFP expression. In the testis, Gli1+ cells were in the
  interstitium, whereas in the adrenal gland, Gli1+ cells were in the adrenal capsule.
  In the adrenal gland, cells underneath the capsule were positive of SHH (EGFP+ cells
  in Shh-CreERT2;NuTRAP mice). SHH is the ligand of the SHH signaling pathway which
  elicits its function in Gli1+ capsular cells. Scale bars: 50 Î¼m.'
