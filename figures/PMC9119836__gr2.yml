caption: Effect of IPO7 on the proliferation and apoptosis of PC cells. (A‒B) qRT-PCR
  and Western blotting were adopted to verify the transfection efficiency of pcDNA-IPO7
  and IPO7-siRNAs. (C‒E) CCK-8 assay and EdU experiment showed that PC cell proliferation
  was enhanced in pcDNA-IPO7 group and decreased in the IPO7-siRNA#1 and IPO7-siRNA#2
  group. (F‒G) Flow cytometry and TUNEL assay showed that IPO7 overexpression inhibited
  PC cell apoptosis, and IPO7-siRNA#1 or IPO7-siRNA#2 could promote cell apoptosis.
  All of the experiments were performed in triplicate (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p
  < 0.001).
