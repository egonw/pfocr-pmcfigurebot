caption: The concentration of intracellular chloride is altered by KIF4 mutation in
  a PARP1-TrkB dependent manner in hippocampal primary neurons. (A) Calibration of
  ClopHensorN fluorescence in the hippocampal neurons. Scale bar, 20 µm. Statistical
  results exhibited green/red fluorescence ratio decreasing with intracellular chloride
  concentration gradient. Data are presented as mean ± SEM (n = 30, 3 independent
  experiments). (B) ClopHensorN fluorescence images of hippocampal culture neurons
  (DIV 18) demonstrating a higher intracellular chloride concentration in the mutant
  neurons and the NAD or ANA-12 could rescue this phenotype. Scale bar, 20 µm. Data
  are presented as mean ± SEM (n = 30, 3 independent experiments). ***P < 0.001, ****P
  < 0.0001 (two-way ANOVA).
