caption: 'GO analysis of the shared exosomal proteome. Shared exosomal proteome associated
  molecular functions (a), biological processes (b) and pathways (c). GO analysis
  was performed for gene lists corresponding to the exosomal proteomes from serum,
  plasma and CSF, through the Panther classification system. Abbreviations of molecular

  molecular function regulator; GO:0005198 structural molecule activity; GO:0060089
  molecular transducer activity; GO:0005215 transporter activity; GO:0140110 transcription
  regulator activity. Abbreviations of biological process GOs terms: GO:0009987 cellular
  process; GO:0008152 metabolic process; GO:0050896 response to stimulus; GO:0002376
