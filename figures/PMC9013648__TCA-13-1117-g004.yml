caption: Epiplakin1 knockdown inhibited the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. (a) KEGG analysis
  was accomplished by the clusterProfiler package in R. (b) GSEA revealed significant
  differences (false discovery rate, FDR q value <0.05; nominal, NOM p value <0.05)
  in enrichment of the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) Collection (c2.cp.v7.2.symbols.gmt).
  (c) The proteins related to the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway were measured by western
  blot with the indicated antibodies (p < 0.05). Values represent means ± SD, n = 3.
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
article_title: Epiplakin1 promotes the progression of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
  by activating the PI3K‐AKT signaling pathway.
