caption: A Immunoblot and densitometry of HEK293T expressing c-Mpl C-terminus tyrosine
  mutants (Y567F, Y602F, Y607F for c-Mpl-del; Y591F, Y626F, Y631F for c-Mpl-p) co-immunoprecipitated
  with phospho-JAK2 following 20 ng/mL of TPO stimulation. B Immunoblot showing levels
  of phosphorylated downstream signaling proteins following Dami-P or Dami-DEL stimulation
  with indicated TPO concentrations. GAPDH was used as the loading control. Phospho-JAK2/GAPDH,
  phospho-AKT/GAPDH, phospho-STAT5/GAPDH, and phospho-ERK1/2/GAPDH densitometric ratios
  were recorded. C KEGG pathway enrichment analysis in c-Mpl-del expressed AML patients
  from TCGA data set. D Immunoblot showing levels of Bcl-2, Bax, and DDIT3 from Dami-GFP
  or Dami-DEL cells stimulated with TPO and treated with or without small molecule
  inhibitors of JAK2 (AZD1480), STATs (SH-4-54), ERK1/2 (SCH772984) and AKT (AZD5363).
  E Immunoblot showing the rescue of decreased Bcl-2 and increased Bax following Ara-c
  and ATRA treatment in presence of JAK2 (AZD1480) and AKT (AZD5363) inhibitors in
  TPO-stimulated Dami-DEL cells. F Immunoblot showing the rescue of decreased Bcl-2
  and increased Bax following JAK2 and AKT knockdown in presence of Ara-c and ATRA
  in TPO-stimulated Dami-DEL cells. Data represent the mean ± SD (n = 3; *p < 0.05;
  **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001).
