caption: Cofilin regulates tumor radioresistance and other malignant behaviors. (A)
  Cofilin can enhance tumor radioresistance through activating Rac1-WAVE2-Arp2/3-Cofilin
  signaling pathway. (B) Low-dose EMAP-II promotes increased the activation of MLC
  and cofilin via RhoA/ROCK/MLC/Cofilin pathway, thereby triggering actin cytoskeleton
  dynamic remodeling and ultimately increasing the permeability of BTB. (C) HIF1α
  induced by TNFα impulses cofilin-mediated changes in actin filament dynamics to
  stabilize MHC-I clusters through affecting mitochondrial localization of HKII, eventually
  affecting tumor immune-related outcomes. (D) Activation of c-Myc promotes nuclear
  translocation of cofilin and F-actin cytoskeleton dynamic remodeling, which may
  in turn affect tumor cell division and metastasis. Created with BioRender.com.
