caption: The PPI networks of DEMs in the H vs. L groups. Circle nodes, genes/proteins;
  rectangle nodes, KEGG pathway or GO terms. Pathways or GO terms are colored with
  gradient color from yellow to blue, with yellow for smaller p-value and blue for
  bigger p-value. According to trend analysis, genes/proteins are colored in red (representing
  up-regulation) and green (representing down-regulation). Interactions are shown
  as solid lines between genes/proteins, and edges of KEGG pathways/Go terms are presented
  as dashed lines.
