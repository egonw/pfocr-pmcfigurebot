caption: Myricetin induces apoptosis in the AGSgastric cancer cell. (A) The AGSgastric
  cancer cells were treated with myricetin (0, 15, and 25 μM) for 24 h, and the cells
  were subsequently stained with DAPI. The arrows indicate chromatin condensation
  in AGSgastric cancer cells. Scale bar, 10 μm. (B) The AGSgastric cancer cells were
  treated with 0, 15, and 25 μM doses of myricetin for 24 h, and the rate of cellular
  apoptosis was assayed by flow cytometry.(C)The bar graph represents the apoptotic
  bodies (% of total cells).(D)The bar graph represents the cell distribution rate.(E)
  The AGSgastric cancer cell was treated with myricetin (0, 15, and 25 μM) for 24
  h, and the cells were harvested to measure the levels of PARP, Bax and Bcl-2proteins
  by western blotting. The results are representative of three independent experiments.
