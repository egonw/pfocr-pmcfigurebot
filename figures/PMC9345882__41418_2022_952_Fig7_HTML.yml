figure_title: Schematic diagram depicting a molecular mechanism by which the CK2/USP4/SIRT1
  signaling axis controls sclerostin expression in osteocytes
caption: CK2-induced USP4 phosphorylation mediates the deubiquitination of SIRT1 and
  stabilization of SIRT1. Upregulation of SIRT1 downregulates sclerostin expression
  in osteocytes and decreases a RANKL/OPG ratio, which decreases osteoclastogenesis
  and increases osteoblastogenesis simultaneously.
