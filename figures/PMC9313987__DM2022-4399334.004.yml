caption: Evodiamine induces G2/M cell cycle arrest in DU145 cells. (a) After treatment
  with evodiamine (0, 1.25, 2.5, and 5.0 μM) for 24 h, the cell cycle distributions
  were analyzed by flow cytometry. The cell population in the G2/M phase significantly
  augmented in a dose-dependent manner. (b) The cell populations were quantified using
  Prism. Each column represents the cell population in different phases (n = 3). (c)
  DU145 cells were treated with evodiamine (0, 1.25, 2.5, and 5.0 μM) for 24 h. The
  protein expression levels of CDK1, p-CDK1Thr14, cyclin B1, and p-Cdc25CSer216 were
  detected by Western blot. β-Actin was used as the loading control. Evodiamine-induced
  G2/M cell cycle arrest is associated with upregulation of p-CDK1Thr14/CDK1 and cyclin
  B1 and downregulation of p-Cdc25CSer216. (d) Quantitative analysis of the relative
  protein expression. Data are presented as the mean ± SD (n = 3). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P
  < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001 versus the control group.
