caption: Links between gut microbiota and ketogenesis in dairy cows. (A) Volcano plot
  indicating the differences in the abundances of gut bacteria at the genus level
  between the HE and HYK cows at each time point. (B) Comparisons of Lactobacillus
  and Frisingicoccus abundances between the HE and HYK cows over time. Data are presented
  as means ± SEM. (C) Associations between the abundance of Lactobacillus or Frisingicoccus
  and circulating BHB levels in dairy cows based on Spearman’s correlation analysis.
  (D) The heatmap displays the associations between serum marker level and the abundance
  of Lactobacillus or Frisingicoccus. TKA, total ketogenic amino acids; TGA, total
  glucogenic amino acids; TGKA, total both glucogenic and ketogenic amino acids; TAA,
  total amino acids; TCHO, total cholesterol. (E) Dynamic change of circulating individual
  amino acids involved in the glucogenic and ketogenic pathways. The circle color
  indicates the fold change between HE and HYK groups at each time point. The line
  color indicates the metabolic pathway of amino acids. PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate;
  TCA, tricarboxylic acid. (F) Metabolism pathway of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs),
  involving key Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes orthologs (KO) of microbial
  taxa related to glucogenesis and ketogenesis. The line chart indicates the dynamic
  changes of KO abundance between the HE and HYK groups from d −7 to d +14. k00632,
  fadA/fadI (acetyl-CoA acyltransferase); k01825, fadB (3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase);
  k01965, pccA (propionyl-CoA carboxylase alpha chain); k11532, glpX-SEBP (fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase
  II/sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase); k01623, ALDO (fructose-bisphosphate aldolase,
  class I). 0.01 < *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
