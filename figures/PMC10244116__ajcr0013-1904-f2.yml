caption: As the downstream genes of the cGAS-STING pathway, CXCL10 and CCL5 are associated
  with HRD. A. Scatter Plot of Correlation Between CXCL10 and CCL5 Expression in TCGA-OV
  Cohort. B and C. CXCL10 and CCL5 were expressed in the top 20% group and the bottom
  20% of HRD score. D. Survival curves for high versus low expression of CXCL10 and
  CCL5 in the TCGA-OV cohort. E-G. Scatterplot of the correlation between STING, TBK1,
  IRF3 and CXCL10 expression in ovarian cancer patients treated with PARPi in the
  GSE120500 cohort. H. Violin plot of CXCL10 expression in a variety of tumor tissues
  versus normal tissues. I. Violin plot of CCL5 expression in a variety of tumor tissues
  versus normal tissues.
