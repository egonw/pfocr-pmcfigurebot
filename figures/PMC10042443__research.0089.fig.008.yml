caption: (A) Scheme of magnetic-responsive hydrogels modulating macrophage polarization
  with temporal control under a magnetic field to promote bone regeneration by activating
  the podosome/Rho/ROCK mechanical signaling pathway. (B) Quantitative analysis of
  the proportion of M2 and M1 macrophages after different therapies. (C) Synthesis
  and formation processes of MF-responsive hydrogels. (D) Magnetization curves of
  magnetic hydrogels with different concentrations of MNP. (E) Inflammatory process
  modulated by magnetic-responsive hydrogels under magnetic field exposure. (F) Comparison
  of the micro-CT images of different treatments for bone defects. Reproduced with
