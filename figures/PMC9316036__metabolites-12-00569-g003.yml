caption: Temperature dependency of non-enzymatic hydrolysis of metabolic intermediates
  of NAD biosynthesis. Temperature on x-axis is reported in Kelvin (K). Hydrolysis
  rates are given per second (1/s). While the solid dots represent measured hydrolysis
  rates, the solid lines denote the temperature-dependent hydrolysis rates calculated
  using a fitted Arrhenius equation (cf. ). NAAD shows the lowest hydrolysis rates,
  while NR exhibits the highest glycohydrolysis rate at 363.15 K.
