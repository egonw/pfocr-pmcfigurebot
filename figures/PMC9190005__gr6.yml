caption: Correlation network between metabolites. Metabolites involved in phenylpropanoid
  metabolic pathway in the high (A), and low eleutheroside B plants (B). Metabolites
  involved in flavonoid metabolism pathway in the high (C), and low eleutheroside
  B plants (D). The circle with red and blue borders indicates significantly higher
  and lower (VIP>1) metabolite accumulation, respectively, in the high eleutheroside
  B plants than that in the low eleutheroside B plants. The circle without borders
  indicates no significant difference in the high and low eleutheroside B plants.
  Red and blue lines indicate significantly positive and negative correlations between
  metabolites, respectively.
