caption: Metabolomic pathway database analysis indicated that the eight, four, five,
  and six pathways were significantly upregulated (log10 (p-value)>2) in the heart,
  aorta, liver, and plasma, respectively, suggesting that metabolic reprogramming
  in early atherosclerosis is different among tissues. (A) Top 25 enriched metabolic
  pathways in the early stage of atherosclerotic mice. *The figures were generated
  by using MetaboAnalyst 5.0 (https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/MetaboAnalyst/ModuleView.xhtml)BVenn
  diagram analysis on the pathways with P value > log10^2 indicated the roles of five
  new pathways. Serine and threonine metabolism, lysine degradation, phenylalanine
  and tyrosine biosynthesis, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, and beta-alanine metabolism
  have never been reported in atherosclerosis. The heart, aorta, liver, and plasma
  had two, one, one, and two unique pathways. Seven out of 11 inflammation-modulating
  pathways were proinflammatory, including aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis (heart), galactose
  metabolism (aorta), purine metabolism (liver), phenylalanine metabolism and phenylalanine,
  tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis (plasma), lysine degradation (aorta and liver)
  and pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis (heart and plasma). There were no commonly
  shared pathways among the four tissues.
