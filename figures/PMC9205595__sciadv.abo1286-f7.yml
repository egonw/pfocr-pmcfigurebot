figure_title: BACE-1 signaling regulates Aβ uptake by modulating the PI3K-AKT signaling
  pathway
caption: (A and B) WT and Bace-1–null BMDM were treated with Aβ for 30 min, and Rac-1
  activity was determined using the PBD pulldown assay, followed by immunoblotting
  with an anti–Rac-1 antibody. The bar graph in (B) shows elevation of Rac-1 activity
  in Bace-1–null BMDM (N = 3, **P < 0.01, Student’s t test). (C) Elevated ROS levels
  in WT and Bace-1–null BMDM measured spectrophotometrically by changes in DCFDA fluorescence
  30 min after Aβ treatment. (D to F) Immunoblot panel and quantification for phosphorylated
  PI3K (pPI3K) and pAKT, as performed on lysates from WT and Bace-1–null BMDM treated
  with Aβ (1 μM) for the indicated time points. There was significant up-regulation
  of pPI3K and pAKT as early as 30 min after Aβ treatment (N = 3, **P < 0.01, Student’s
  t test). (G and H) Levels of full-length IL-1R2 and TLR4 in the cortex of Bace-1–null
  brains were elevated, but TLR2 levels were slightly increased (N = 3 independent
  experiments, **P < 0.01 and *P < 0.05, Student’s t test), likely related to abolished
  cleavage of these proteins by BACE-1.
