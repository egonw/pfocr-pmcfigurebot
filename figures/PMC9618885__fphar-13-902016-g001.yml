caption: The high expression of SMS2 is related to the poor prognosis of pancreatic
  cancer patients.(A). Based on data obtained from GEPIA, SMS2 is highly expressed
  in pancreatic cancer patients. The data of pancreatic cancer samples comes from
  the TCGA database. The normal samples come from the GTEX database. (B,C and E).
  A total of 178Â TCGA samples are divided into SMS2 High and SMS2 Low according to
  the median value of SMS2 expression (B) High expression of SMS2 is associated with
  lower overall survival rate, and (C) shorter progression-free survival. (D). M2
  polarization biomarkers MRC1 and CD163 are highly expressed in pancreatic cancer
  patients. (E). High expression of SMS2 positively correlates with the expression
  of MRC1 and CD163. (F). The expression of SMS2 positively correlates with the infiltration
  of M2 macrophages, Treg, CAF in pancreatic cancer. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p <
  0.001.
