caption: Expression of genes using the semi-quantitative RT-PCR method. Semi-quantitative
  RT-PCR were performed with root RNAs from 2-, 5-, or 12-day-old seedlings grown
  in MS without NO3− without [R(−)] or with [R(+)] Rhizobium. PsNSP1, nodulation signaling
  pathway; PsHAP2.1, transcription factor of the CCAAT-binding family; PsNAR2, one
  component of the high-affinity nitrate transport system; PsNR1, nitrate reductase;
  PsGS1, cytosolic glutamine synthetase. β-tubulin was used as a control.
article_title: Pisum sativum Response to Nitrate as Affected by Rhizobium leguminosarum-Derived
  Signals.
