caption: An approach to migraine treatment selection. Acute treatment should be offered
  to all patients with migraine. Those with mild-to-moderate symptoms should first
  try analgesics and NSAIDs, while patients with moderate-to-severe symptoms can be
  started on triptans. Patients who do not get adequate relief after a trial period
  should be offered a next tier therapy as indicated. Preventive treatment should
  be offered to patients with frequent attacks (≥4 headache days/month) or when migraine
  interferes with daily activities despite acute therapy. First-line preventive therapies
  include antidepressants, antihypertensives, and antiepileptics. Based on current
  AHS guidelines, novel CGRP pathway targeting therapies for both acute and preventive
  treatment should be initiated in patients who have found at least two medications
  of that type ineffective or intolerable.
