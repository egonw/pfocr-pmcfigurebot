caption: 'NBP suppressed proinflammatory cytokine (PICs) production and TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB
  inflammatory pathway after RCIR injury. (a)–(c) The concentrations of TNF-α, IL-6,
  and IL-1β were determined using ELISA kits. n = 10 in each group. (d)–(g) Representative
  Western blots and densitometry analysis of hippocampal tissues showed the effects
  of NBP on TLR4, MyD88, and phosphorylation level of NF-κB (p-NF-κB) after RCIR.
  n = 6 in each group. β-Actin was used as an internal control. (h) Representative
  immunofluorescence images showed the NF-κB reactivity (green) in the hippocampus.
  The nuclei were labeled with DAPI (blue). White arrows indicated the nuclear translocation
  of NF-κB in the four groups. Scale bar = 20 μm. n = 3 in each group. ∗∗∗P < 0.001,
  the RCIR group vs. the sham group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001, the NBP80
  group or NBP120 group vs. the RCIR group; $P < 0.05, $$P < 0.01, $$$P < 0.001, the
  NBP80 group vs. NBP120 group. Values are expressed as the mean ± SD.'
