caption: 'SKI-mediated EMT through inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway:
  (a) immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that the level of α-SMA protein expression
  was inhibited while E-Ca protein expression was upregulated by SKI (200×); (b) western
  blotting images of Col1, α-SMA, E-Ca, and Actin; (c–e) the relative level of Col1,
  α-SMA, and E-Ca protein expression in HK-2 cells; and (f–i) qRT-PCR revealed the
  level of Col1, FN, α-SMA, and E-Ca mRNA expression.'
