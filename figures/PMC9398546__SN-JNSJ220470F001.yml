caption: 'Biased adaptation induces short-term bidirectional-plasticity in Area 17.
  A, Brain regions being studied in this study are LGN and Areas 17 and 21a. B, Schematic
  figure of the experimental design. Top, The temporal order of stimulation sessions;
  middle, the distribution of orientations during each session; and bottom, the temporal
  structure (test/blank) of a single stimulus. C, Schematic figure of stimulation
  and recording protocol. D, Orientation tuning curves of two typical neurons exposed
  to high-intensity (biased-adaptation probability > 0.6) biased-adaptation stimulus.
  Black and red lines indicate preadaptation and postadaptation conditions, respectively.
  Arrows indicate the orientations of adaptors. E, Population statistics of peak response
  change ratio (%) after high-intensity biased-adaptation stimulus. F, Orientation
  tuning curves of two typical cases exposed to biased-adaptation stimulation; colors
  of lines indicate biased-adaptation probabilities; arrows indicate the orientations
  of adaptors. G, Peak response curves of two typical cases in F. H, Population peak
  response change ratios of Area 17 neurons exposed to biased-adaptation stimulation.
  I, Proportion of bidirectional-plastic, adaptation-only, and stable neurons. J,
  Peak responses of two typical neurons before (−6 min), during (0 min), and after
  (6, 12 min) potentiation induction. K, Recovery time of potentiation-exhibiting
  neurons after potentiation induction. The mean recovery time is 10.04 min. L, Two
  typical cases, averaged neuronal responses to adaptors over time during biased-adaptation
  stimulation. M, Population response-change ratios of tested neuronal responses to
  adaptors over time during biased-adaptation stimulation. Error bars indicate SEM;
  ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05. n.s.: not significant (p ≥ 0.05).'
