caption: Transcriptomic analysis of human drNPC-O2 reveals significant increase in
  neuronal differentiation, maturation, and synaptic transmission by ILP/ISP treatment
  in the injured spinal cord. A, Volcano plot illustrates differentially expressed
  genes at 14 weeks after transplantation (FDR < 0.05, Benjamini–Hochberg, two-sided;
  fold change > 2). B, Gene Ontology analysis for cellular components using R language
  program identifies significantly upregulated and downregulated genes in transplanted
  drNPC-O2 after ILP/ISP co-treatment. These analyses showed that cellular components
  related to neurogenesis and synapse formation were upregulated by blocking LAR and
  PTPσ receptors. C, Gene Ontology analysis for biological processes on human-exclusive
  transcripts indicated upregulation in biological processes related to neural regeneration
  and functional improvement with ILP/ISP treatment. D, Gene Ontology analysis for
  functional enrichment of differentially expressed genes suggests blocking LAR and
  PTPσ receptors upregulates genes related to neuronal transmission and function.
  E, KEGG pathway analysis of human-exclusive transcripts indicated that Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway is upregulated by inhibiting LAR and PTPσ receptors. Fisher's
  exact test, FDR < 0.05, N = 3 animals per group.
