caption: PSII Lifecycle, simplified. Not all accessory assembly chaperones are illustrated.
  (A–D) illustrate de novo synthesis, while (D–G) illustrate the repair cycle. (A)
  The pre-D1 and pre-D2 complexes come together to form the RC module. (B) RC and
  pre-CP47 modules come together to form the RC47 complex. Psb28 binds at this stage.
  (C) Psb27-PSII forms from pre-CP43 module and RC47. (D) The active PSII monomer
  is formed in a series of steps, which include processing of the D1 C-terminus, photo-assembly
  of the Mn4CaO5 cluster, and binding of extrinsic proteins PsbO, PsbV, PsbU, and
  PsbQ. The active PSII dimer forms following complete monomer assembly. (E) Following
  a photodamage event, the extrinsic proteins dissociate, Psb27 binds, and the dimer
  dissociates into monomers. (F) Damaged subunits are removed and proteolytically
  degraded. (G) Newly synthesized PSII subunits are inserted into recycled subunits
  to form a Psb27-PSII complex and the repair pathway re-joins the de novo synthesis
  pathway.
