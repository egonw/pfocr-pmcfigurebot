caption: Transcriptional response of the biotin and thiamine biosynthetic pathways
  in hydrolysate-adapting vs. non-adapting propagation cultures, showing up-regulation
  of both pathways over time (time points t1–t4). A Clustered thiamine biosynthetic
  genes were up-regulated during propagation (red shades denote up-regulation, and
  blue shades down-regulation). The results for all biological replicates are shown
  (n = 3 or 4). B Thiamine biosynthetic pathway genes were significantly (p-value < 10–4)
  up-regulated at the end of adapting vs. non-adapting cultivations (indicated by
  colored reaction arrows and text). C Biotin biosynthetic pathway genes were significantly
  up-regulated (p-value < 10–4) at the end of adapting vs. non-adapting cultivations
  (indicated by colored reaction arrows and text)
