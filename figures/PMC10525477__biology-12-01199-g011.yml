caption: Heatmap of statistical significance of KEGG pathway enrichment analysis based
  on upregulated genes only for infected vs. control comparison. DE genes filtered
  by FDR ≤ 0.05 and log2FC ≥ 1. The plot shows the top 30 enriched KEGG pathways among
  all fish lines. Each cell corresponds to the q-value of enrichment (shown in different
  shades of blue). Black cells indicate missing annotation. Pathways related to disease
  are shown in bold with asterisk.
