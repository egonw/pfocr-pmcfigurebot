caption: 'Effects of AOH, ATX-II, and a mixture of both on relative gene transcription
  levels of (A) TNF-a (encoding for TNF-α), (B) CXCL-8 (encoding for IL-8), (C) MMP-2,
  and (D) MMP-9 in IL-1β-stimulated HCEC-1CT cells measured with qRT-PCR; mRNA levels
  are normalized to the endogenous controls HPRT1 and HMBS and are presented as relative
  quantity (RQ) in comparison to solvent control-treated with IL-1β (25 ng/mL) for
  3 h, which was set to 1. Cells were treated with respective compounds for 5 h, while
  after 2 h of incubation, IL-1β was added as an inflammatory stimulus. Data are expressed
  as mean values + SD normalized to IL-1β C (control) and represent three to seven
  individually conducted experiments. Significant differences to IL-1β stimulation
  were calculated applying a two-sample t-test and are indicated with * (p < 0.05),
  ** (p < 0.01), and *** (p < 0.001). Combinatory effects marked with # were calculated
  to be significantly different from both single compounds’ effects; $ indicates significant
  differences against the effect of AOH alone (p < 0.05).'
