caption: Intensity of responses and genomic alterations in the PI3K pathway or DNA
  damage repair in patients with metastatic breast cancer on this study. In the waterfall
  plot (top), there are 5 blank bars with asterisks (patients 78, 86, 99, 110, 118).
  Three of them (patients 99, 110, and 118) had DLT or progression in the brain before
  the first restaging scan so target lesion was unevaluable. Two participants (patients
  78 and 86) did not have evaluable target lesions. Mutations in FANCB, FANCM, and
  TSC2 were not found. U = “Unknown BRCA status”. N = “Non-BRCA carrier”.
