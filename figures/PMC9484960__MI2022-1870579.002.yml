caption: 'LMX1B knockdown increased IL-1β-induced SW1353 cell growth and suppressed
  its apoptosis. (a) Western blot analysis for LMX1B protein expression; (b) CCK-8
  analysis for SW1353 cell survival; (c) 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay was
  used to determine SW1353 cell proliferation; (d) SW1353 cell apoptosis was detected
  by using flow cytometer analysis. SW1353 cells were transfected with control siRNA
  or LMX1B siRNA for 24 h by using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent and then treated with
  10 ng/ml IL-1β for 24 h. ∗P < 0.05, compared with the control group; #P < 0.05,
  compared with the IL-1β group. All experiments were repeated three times.'
