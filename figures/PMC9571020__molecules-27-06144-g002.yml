caption: Comparative Michaelis-Menten kinetics of DesD catalytic turnover of dfoE
  from HSC (A, in green) versus dfoG1 (B, in black, data previously reported []).
  Continuous calorimetric data was ascertained from a single injection of wt DesD
  at 1 ÂµM concentration into a cell containing 2 mM HSC/10 mM ATP or 1 mM dfoG1/5
  mM ATP. Each data point represents the average (small cross) and standard deviation
  (vertical lines) of three replicate trials, and for clarity, every other data point
  is shown. Data were analyzed in GraphPad Prism 8.2.
