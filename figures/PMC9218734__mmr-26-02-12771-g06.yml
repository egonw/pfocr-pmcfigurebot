caption: Co-expression RNA regulation network construction and functional enrichment
  analysis. (A) Construction of a hypoxia-related competing endogenous RNA regulation
  network based on predicted microRNAs and hypoxia-related mRNAs. (B-K) Gene Ontology-Biological
  Process gene sets enriched in the high-risk group, including activation of immune
  response (NES=1.75; P=0.012), regulation of immune system process (NES=1.63; P=0.002),
  adaptive immune response (NES=2.05; P<0.001), development of immune system (NES=1.82;
  P<0.001), positive regulation of immune response (NES=1.94; P<0.001), positive regulation
  of cell death (NES=1.77; P=0.002), negative regulation of cell cycle (NES=1.57;
  P=0.028), positive regulation of Wnt signalling pathway (NES=1.85; P<0.001) and
  regulation of Wnt signalling pathway (NES=1.75; P=0.004). NES, normalized enrichment
  score.
