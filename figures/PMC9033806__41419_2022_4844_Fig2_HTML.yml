figure_title: Somatic alterations and driver gene analysis in 45 CRC samples
caption: 'a Schematic of the workflow for the identification of novel driver genes.
  b Sample-based OncoPrint of the top- 10 driver genes identified using the IntOGen
  algorithm. Each column represents an individual sample, and each row represents
  a gene. Top: total number of somatic alterations (y axis) in each sample (x axis).
  Right: percentage of somatic alterations in 45 CRC samples. c Analysis of GXYLT1
  mRNA expression levels in CRC tumors and matched normal tissues (GSE32323). d Analysis
  of GXYLT1 mRNA expression levels with respect to tumor stage (GSE17537). e Kaplan–Meier
  survival analysis of GXYLT1 levels and survival (GSE17537) in GEO datasets. *p < 0.05,
  ***p < 0.001.'
article_title: A stop-gain mutation in GXYLT1 promotes metastasis of colorectal cancer
  via the MAPK pathway.
