caption: FLOT2 suppresses TGF-β signaling pathway by regulating CD109 expression(A)
  GSEA profiles showing significant enrichment of TGF-β signaling pathway genes in
  the 5-8F-shFLOT2 group compared with the 5-8F-control group.(B) Western blot showed
  the effects of FLOT2 on Smad2 and p-Smad2 protein levels.(C) qRT-PCR was used to
  assay the effect of FLOT2 on the mRNA level of downstream targets of TGF-β pathway.(D)
  qRT-PCR was used to assay the effect of FLOT2 on the mRNA level of CD109.(E) Western
  blot was used to assay the effect of FLOT2 on the protein level of CD109.(F) Western
  blot was used to assay the effect of CD109 on the protein levels of Smad2 and p-Smad2
  altered by the changes in FLOT2 expression in NPC cells.(G) qRT-PCR was used to
  assay the effect of CD109 on the mRNA levels of TGF-β signal-pathway-related genes
  altered by the changes in FLOT2 expression in NPC cells. ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01;
  ∗∗∗p < 0.001. Data are represented as mean ± SD.
