caption: 'Effect of arbutin on the proliferation of HaCAT and DFL cells after induced
  by heat stress. (a) 48 hours after 4°C-50 minutes heat stress, the growth of HaCAT
  and DFL cells with solvent and different concentrations of arbutin (10, 50, and
  100 μmol/L) was observed; statistically compared the value of OD450 in the detection
  of CCK8 proliferation (n = 3). (b) The expression levels of PCNA and Ki-67 in HaCAT
  and DFL cells of different groups determined by immunofluorescence staining. (c)
  PCNA protein expression in HaCAT and DFL cells of different groups detected by Western
  blotting. (d) Statistically compared expression of PCNA protein (n = 3). P value
  was calculated by one-way ANOVA. ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. the control group; #P < 0.05,
  ##P < 0.01, and ###P < 0.001 vs. the solvent group.'
