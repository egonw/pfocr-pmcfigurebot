caption: The signalling pathways by which LA alleviates respiratory diseases. Starting
  from the left-hand side, LA suppresses the activation of the PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways,
  thereby inhibiting NF-κB, Nrf2, and HIF-1α and decreasing the expression of many
  molecules that are involved in airway remodelling. Next, LA reduces FGF2 and increases
  VEGF levels, thereby inhibiting fibrosis and necrotic reactions in the lungs. Then,
  LA activates the PI3K/Akt pathway and inhibits NF-κB-dependent upregulation of proinflammatory
  mediators. Moreover, LA-mediated NF-κB inactivation is regulated by the upregulation
  of HO-1 and downregulation of TNF-α. Subsequently, the suppression of NF-κB activation
  decreases iNOS expression and NO production in macrophages, thereby alleviating
  inflammation. Next, LA can increase NRF2 and antioxidant enzyme levels. Similarly,
  LA activates the AMPK/PGC-1α signalling pathway, thereby improving mitochondrial
  function and subsequently reducing oxidative stress. LA inhibits the expression
  of PDK1 (the PDH kinase), releasing Keap1 bound by p-PDH, which directly decreases
  NRF2 and initiates the ROS-induced apoptosis pathway. LA induces ROS generation,
  resulting in the upregulation of ER stress and a decrease in Bcl-2 protein and integrin
  β1/β3 levels. The reduction in these integrins then causes a decrease in p-FAK and
  its downstream survival signal AKT, thereby inducing cancer cell apoptosis. In addition,
  LA can activate mTOR and its downstream target p70S6K, thereby suppressing autophagy.
  Finally, LA downregulates Grb2-mediated EGFR phosphorylation and inhibits EGFR-MAPK/ERK
  signalling, resulting in the suppression of cancer cell proliferation.
