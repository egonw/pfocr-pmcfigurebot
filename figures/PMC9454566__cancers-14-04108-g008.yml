caption: Pathway analysis of key genes being up- or down-regulated on the transcript
  level upon 48 h of chemerin (huChem-157) treatment in OVCAR-3 cells as assessed
  by Affymetrix Clariom S human microarrays. Most of the up-regulated genes (red)
  are IFNα-response genes, with IRF9 as the key mediator of IFNα-induced gene regulation
  (as part of the ISGF3 complex, not shown). The observed regulation pattern is predicted
  to lead to growth inhibition of tumor cells (Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) software,
  Qiagen) (see discussion section). Broken arrows indicate transcriptional activation,
  other arrows protein interaction. The color intensity represents the measured grade
  of mRNA up- (red) or down-regulation (green).
