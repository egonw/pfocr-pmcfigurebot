figure_title: β Cell proliferation during puberty correlated with plasma IGF1/GH levels
  and GH/5-HT pathway gene expression in islets
caption: (A) Plasma IGF1 levels and β cell proliferation (from ) in female (red) and
  male (black) rats from 3–9 wk of age (n = 4–7). (B) Plasma GH levels in female (red)
  and male (black) rats from 3–9 wk of age (n = 4-5). (C) Ghr, Tph1, Htr1d, and Htr2b
  mRNA levels in rat islets isolated at different ages as indicated (n = 4–5). mRNA
  was quantified by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and normalized to cyclophilin
  (Ppia). Data are presented as the fold change over the prepubertal time point (3
  wk of age). Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05 following 1-way ANOVA with
  Tukey’s multiple-comparison test (C).
