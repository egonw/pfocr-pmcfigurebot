caption: The expression of RBP7 in different human tissues and pan cancers. (a) RBP7
  expression profiles in normal human tissues from the GTEx project. nTPM, normalized
  protein-coding transcripts per million. (b) The protein expression of RBP7 in normal
  human tissues. (c) The mRNA expression levels of RBP7 in different cancer types
  were explored by TIMER. It is presented by ranking the p value. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p <
  0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001.
