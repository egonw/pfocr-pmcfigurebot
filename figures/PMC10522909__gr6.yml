caption: 'The analysis of canonical pathways (signaling pathways) involved in the
  early and late signaling processes after FS or SPS&FS exposure. (A) The heat map
  represents the signaling pathways involved in the early and late phases after FS
  or SPS&FS exposure. An asterisk (*) indicates a pathway is statically insignificant
  (|activation z-score| ≤ 1.96). The color shows the z-scores of DEGs annotated in
  the specific signaling biological process. ST: short-term (<2 h after FS or SPS&FS
  exposure); LT: long-term (7 days after FS or SPS&FS exposure). (B) The average expression
  profiles for DEGs involved in major signaling processes. The y-axis shows the average
  z-score of genes in the specific signaling process term. (For interpretation of
  the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web
  version of this article.)'
