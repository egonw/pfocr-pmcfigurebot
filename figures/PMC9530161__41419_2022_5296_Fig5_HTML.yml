figure_title: TRIM11 regulates H3K4me3 on enhancers through KDM5C
caption: A, B Heat maps generated from ChIP-seq data showing the occupancy of H3K27ac
  and H3K4me3 on enhancers, promoters and KDM5C regulated enhancers in TRIM11-KD and
  KDM5C-KD MDA-MB-231 cell lines. C A sketch map to show the pipeline to identify
  promoters and H3K4me3-enriched enhancers regulated by TRIM11 and KDM5C. Differential
  H3K4me3 peaks in KDM5C-KD were identified by 1.5-fold change, and 1-fold change
  in TRIM11-KD. D Biological process and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses of adjacent
  genes controlled by enhancers whose H3K4me3 was up-regulated in KDM5C-KD and down-regulated
  in TRIM11-KD.
