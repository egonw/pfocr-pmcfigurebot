caption: Senescence abrogates complement-mediated M1. (A) Further clustering of T
  cells projected on UMAP into 6 functional states. Correlation between the frequency
  of specific cell types evaluated by Pearson’s correlation analysis with r value
  presented as heat map (B) and correlation plot (C). (D) Comparison of cell type
  frequencies between sene-low and -high patients. (E, F) Number of cellular interactions
  of the complement signaling pathway between CCL20 + versus - Ductal 2 cells and
  macrophage subsets inferred by CellChat. (G) Characterization of typical M1 products
  (TNFa and CXCL10) and M2 products (CD206 and TGFb) after stimulation with CCL20,
  complement protein, compared to control polarization phenotypes of LPS-induced M1
  and IL4-induced M2, with expression values normalized to baseline expression in
  PMA-activated, undifferentiated THP-1 cells. * p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001, ns
  not significant.
