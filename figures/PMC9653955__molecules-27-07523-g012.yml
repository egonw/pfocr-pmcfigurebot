caption: Cell viability of MK cells following treatment with niraparib, niraparib+F5
  or niraparib+F7. Cell viability was determined by XTT assay at 48 h as a function
  of live cell number. Control was vehicle control (1.00% v/v methanol + 0.60% v/v
  DMSO). Error bars indicate ± SE (n = 2). Levels with different Upper case letters
  were significantly different from all combinations of pairs by Tukey–Kramer honest
  significant difference (HSD; p ≤ 0.05).
