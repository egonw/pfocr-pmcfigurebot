caption: Significantly changed gene pathways with the increase of dietary protein
  content. (a) Significantly changed pathways related to the increasing dietary protein
  content. (b) Significantly changed pathways correlated independently with the increasing
  protein level. Gene expression patterns in different protein content groups in (c)
  EIF2a signaling pathway, (d) unfolded protein response, (e) regulation of eIF4 and
  p70S6K signaling, (f) tRNA charging pathway, blue indicates lower and red indicates
  higher expression. Generalized linear modeling and Pearson correlation analysis
  were performed to analyze the dietary protein effect on gene expression patterns

  serum metabolome in mice.
