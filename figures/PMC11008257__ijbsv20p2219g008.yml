caption: ISRIB could target NUP85 to protect NAFLD. A. Binding site of ISRIB to NUP85.
  B-C. In vitro, CCK8 was used to explore the concentration of ISRIB. D. AML-12 cells
  were cultivated with or without ISRIB (80 um) for 24 h and CETSA test was performed.
  E-G. H&E staining and Oil Red O staining of liver sections. H. Immunohistochemistry
  of liver tissues. I-K. Serum ALT, AST and TG assay. L-N. Levels of serum IL-1β,
  IL-6 and TNF-α. Measurement metrics are shown in the figure. All experimental results
  of this study were replicated at least three times. **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 compared
  with the control group.
