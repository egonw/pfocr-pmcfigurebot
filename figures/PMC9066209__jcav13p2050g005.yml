caption: CuI down-regulated JA2/STAT3 signalling pathway in PDAC cells. (A) CuI induced
  a decrease of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 protein levels and does not influence the protein
  levels of T-JAK2 and T-STAT3 in CuI-treated PDAC cells. (B) Colivelin activated
  JAK2/STAT3 signalling pathway inhibited by CuI. (C-D) Colivelin significantly rescued
  the number of clones inhibited by CuI. (E) Colivelin significantly restored the
  number of cells inhibited by CuI.
