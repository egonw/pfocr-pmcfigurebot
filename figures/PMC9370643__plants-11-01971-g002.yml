caption: 'Quantitative evaluation of differentially expressed transcripts between
  BNF-contrasting genotypes. (a) The figure shows the number of differentially expressed
  transcripts that are more represented in each genotype for each condition. (b) Venn
  diagram shows the number of transcripts differentially expressed between SP and
  CH in each set (tissue and growth conditions). (c,d) Gene ontology (GO) enrichment
  analysis of DET in (c) stalk root and (d) stalk shoot. The first circle: the most
  enriched terms; outside the circle is the coordinated ruler of the number of transcripts.
  The second circle: the classification number in the background. The more transcripts,
  the longer the bar. The third circle: bar graph of the ratio of the DETs; red represents
  the ratio of the upregulated transcripts in SP, and blue represents it in CH. The
  fourth circle: The Rich Factor value of each category (the number of foreground
  transcripts in the category divided by the number of background transcripts). (e,f)
  The circus diagrams represent the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DETs in stalk
  root (e) and stalk shoot (f) of SP and CH. The figures show only the most significantly
  enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways that are involved in hormone, nitrogen, and
  amino acid pathways, such as: plant hormone—plant hormone signal transduction; Brassinost—Brassinosteroid
  biosynthesis; Nitrogen m—Nitrogen metabolism; Glutathione—Glutathione metabolism;
  Cyanoami—Cyanoamino acid metabolism; Arginine a—Arginine and proline metabolism;
  Arginine b—Arginine biosynthesis; beta-Alani—beta-Alanine metabolism; Tyrosine m—Tyrosine
  metabolism; Cysteine a—Cysteine and methionine metabolism; Tryptophan—Tryptophan
  metabolism; Phosphonat—Phosphonate and phosphinate metabolism; Lysine deg—Lysine
  degradation; Phenylalanine—Phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis;
  Phenylalanine m—Phenylalanine metabolism; Selenocomp—Selenocompound metabolism;
  Lysine bio—Lysine biosynthesis. Red represents the number of the upregulated transcripts
  in SP, and blue in CH. The GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed using
  OmicShare tools.'
