caption: 'ROCK inhibitors Fasudil and Y27632 can attenuate synaptic disrupter caused
  by acrolein. Primary cultured rat cortical neurons were treated with acrolein (5 μM)
  for 24 h, and drug treatment administration‐Fasudil (Fas) 10 Μm/20 μM and Y27632
  (Y) 5 μM/10 μM). (a) Cells were analyzed the changes of neuron branches using a
  phase difference microscope. (b) Cells were then subjected to immunofluorescence
  analysis for the expression of TUJ‐1 (red) and Synapsin1 (green). Nuclei were counterstained
  with DAPI (blue). Scale bar = 40 μm. (c) Cells were then to collected using Western
  blot to analyze the protein levels change of PSD95, SV2a, and Synapsin 1. Acr, Acrolein;
  Fas, Fasudil; Y, Y27632. The data were expressed as mean ± SEM, n = 3, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001 vs. control group. #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001 vs. model group'
