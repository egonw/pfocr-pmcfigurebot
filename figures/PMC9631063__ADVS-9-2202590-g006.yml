caption: 'Sch B regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines in H9C2 cells.
  A,B) H9C2 cells were pretreated with 10 × 10−6 m Sch B for 1 h before exposure to
  HG for 6 h. RNA sequencing was carried out and differentially expressed genes were
  identified by DESeq 2. Panel (A) shows the Venn diagram of differentially expressed
  genes between control versus HG and HG versus HG+Sch B. WikiPathway enrich analysis
  of overlap of differentially expressed genes in plane B. The inflammatory response
  pathway is highlighted by red. C) Schematic illustrating HG‐induced innate toll‐like
  receptor‐4 (TLR4) signaling leading to the induction of inflammatory factors. D)
  Heat‐map of inflammation cytokines detected by qPCR assay. H9C2 cells were pretreated
  with 10 × 10−6 m Sch B for 1 h and then exposed to HG for 8 h. Left panel shows
  inflammation cytokines that were suppressed by Sch B pretreatment. Right panel shows
  factors that were not suppressed by Sch B. E) qPCR verification of classical TLR4
  proinflammatory cytokines (TNF‐α and IL6) and type 1 interferons (IFN‐α and ‐β)
  in H9C2 cells pretreated with Sch B before HG exposure. Cells were treated as indicated
  for panel (D). F) NF‐κB and IRES reporter activity in H9C2 cells exposed to HG,
  with or without Sch B pretreatment. Data in panels (E) and (F) are shown as mean
  ± SEM (n = 3; **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 compared to Ctrl and ##p < 0.01, ns = not
  significant, compared to by one‐way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni''s multiple comparisons
  test).'
