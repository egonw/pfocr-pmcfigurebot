caption: Regulation model of BnKAT2 on the effective length of the main inflorescence
  and number of siliques in B. napus. (1) BnKAT2 participates in the auxin signaling
  pathway by regulating the expression of Aux/IAA by cGMP. (2) BnKAT2 participates
  in the auxin signaling pathway by regulating the expression of AHP and ARR genes.
