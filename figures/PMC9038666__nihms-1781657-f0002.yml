caption: In situ identification of activated Insulin-like Growth factor receptor (IGF)
  in Taenia solium cysts. Immunofluorescence performed on a racemose cyst, vesicular
  cysts, and racemose cyst treatment with metformine (Met). Nuclei were stained with
  DAPI (A, D, G). Cells positive for the phospho IGF receptor (B, E, H) were observed
  only in racemose larvae (red arrows). Merge (C, F, I). Representative images. The
  graph (J) depicts the ratio of phospho IGF to nuclei fluorescence intensity in racemose
  cyts, untreated and treated with Met (4 mM) relative to vesicular cysts. Values
  are expressed as means Â± S.D. One-way ANOVA test (****P<0.0001).
article_title: Proliferative cells in racemose neurocysticercosis have an active MAPK
  signalling pathway and respond to metformin treatment.
