caption: p53 promotes Pi metabolic inhibition and apoptosis of HSCs induced by IR.
  (A) Representative flow cytometric analysis and fold change of p53 MFI in BM HSCs
  of mice at 3 dpi (n = 5). (B) Representative flow cytometric analysis and fold change
  of PUMA MFI in BM HSCs of mice at 3 dpi (n = 5). (C) Representative flow cytometric
  analysis of MMP by TMRE staining and fold change of TMRE MFI in BM HSCs of mice
  at 3 dpi (n = 5). (D) Fold change of p53 MFI in BM HSCs of WT mice and Slc20a1+/−
  mice at 3 dpi (n = 5). (E) Fold change of p53 MFI in BM HSCs of mice with or without
  Klotho treatment at 3 dpi (n = 5). (F) Fold change of p53 MFI in BM HSCs of mice
  with or without MK-2206 treatment at 3 dpi (n = 5). (G) Fold change of p53 MFI in
  BM HSCs of WT and Kl+/− mice at 3 dpi (n = 5). (H) GSEA of p53 pathway gene set
  in HSCs with enhanced Pi metabolism (PRJNA695319). (I) Scheme for the creation of
  mouse model of irradiation-induced myelosuppression using p53−/− mice and HSC analysis.
  (J) Relative HSC numbers in the BM of WT and p53−/−mice post IR compared to those
  at 0 dpi (n = 6). (K) Representative flow cytometric analysis and quantification
  of apoptotic HSCs in the BM of WT and p53−/− mice at 3 dpi (n = 6). (L–N) WBC, RBC,
  and platelet counts in PB of WT and p53−/− mice post IR (n = 6). (O) Relative HSC
  numbers in the BM of p53−/− mice with or without Klotho or MK-2206 treatment post
  IR compared to those at 0 dpi (n = 5). (P) Frequency of apoptotic HSCs in the BM
  of p53−/− mice with or without Klotho or MK-2206 treatment at 3 dpi (n = 5). Data
  are mean ± SD. ns = not significant. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01. Two-tailed unpaired
  Student’s t-test. (O,P) One-way ANOVA.
