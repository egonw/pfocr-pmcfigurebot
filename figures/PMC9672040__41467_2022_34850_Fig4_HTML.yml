figure_title: Deregulated purine biosynthesis is associated with NADH accumulation-induced
  cell death
caption: 'a The rationale of screening for NADH accumulation-associated cell death-promoting
  genes. b Workflow for the CRISPR/Cas9 screening strategy. Two sgRNA pools (Human
  GeCKO v2 and Brunello libraries) were used. c Metabolic processes coupling glycolysis
  (black lines), pentose phosphate pathway (blue lines), and purine biosynthesis (purple
  lines). The green balloon shows the potential activation of PRPS by NADH. G6P, glucose
  6-phosphate; F6P, fructose 6-phosphate; GAP, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; R5P, Ribose
  5-phosphate; PRPP, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate; IMP, inosine monophosphate; AMP,
  adenosine monophosphate; GMP, guanosine monophosphate; d Effects of TKT knockout
  on the proliferation of HeLaTet-on EcSTH or HeLaTet-on EcSTH-LbNOX cells (n = 3
  biologically independent samples). Cells were counted after treatment with Dox (0.1 µg/mL)
  for 48 h. The immunoblot showed the levels of TKT. From left to right: **P = 0.00015,
  **P = 1.48e-05. e Principal-component analysis of metabolites in HeLaTet-on EcSTH
  cells with sgTKT versus sgControl cultured with Dox (0.1 µg/mL) for 24 h (n = 3
  biologically independent samples). f Volcano plot of the differential metabolites
  (two-tailed Student’s t-tests) between sgTKT and sgControl in HeLaTet-on EcSTH cells
  cultured with Dox (0.1 µg/mL) for 24 h (n = 3 biologically independent samples).
  The red highlights represent metabolites involved in purine metabolism and the pentose
  phosphate pathway. g KEGG pathway analysis of the upregulated metabolites (fold
  change > 1.5, P value < 0.05) using MetaboAnalyst 5.0. h Effects of purine biosynthesis
  inhibitors on proliferation of TKT knockout HeLaTet-on EcSTH and MDA-MB-231Tet-on
  EcSTH cells (n = 3 biologically independent samples). Cells were pretreated with
  the indicated inhibitors for 2 h and counted after treatment with Dox (0.1 µg/mL)
  and inhibitors for 48 h. 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP, 300 µM), pelitrexol (PTrexol, 10 µM),
  lometrexol (LTrexol, 10 µM). From left to right: **P = 1.53e-05, **P = 1.85e-05,
  **P = 3.40e-05, **P = 2.31e-05, **P = 7.37e-07, **P = 5.72e-06, **P = 2.24e-05,
  **P = 8.99e-05. d, h Data were verified in at least three independent experiments.
  Error bars represent mean ± SD. **P < 0.01; Two-tailed Student’s t-tests. Source
