caption: 'Naringenin activated Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway to block endoplasmic reticulum
  stress in HK-2 cells. 200 μM of NRG was added to the medium 24 h before model construction,
  and then, they were incubated with or without brusatol (400 nM) 2 h before hypoxia.
  (a) Naringenin activated Nrf2 and HO-1 after H/R injury. (b) Western blot analysis
  proved that Nrf2 and HO-1 protein levels were effectively prevented by brusatol
  (Bru) in HK-2 cells. (c) Inhibiting Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway reversed the function
  of naringenin on restraining ER stress. Values measured during cellular experiments
  were carried out as mean ± SD, n = 3. ∗P < 0.05, versus the control group; #P <
  0.05, compared with the H/R group; &P < 0.05, relative to the NRG+H/R group.'
