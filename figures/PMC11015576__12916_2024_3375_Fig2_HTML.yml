caption: PREX2 promotes the radiation resistance of CRC cells in vitro. A A basal
  level of PREX2 was determined using Western blot analysis in several CRC cell lines
  (including RKO, CaCo2, HCT15, HCT116, SW480, SW620, HT29, and LoVo). B Stable overexpression
  and interference cell lines were detected by Western blotting. C Survival fraction
  with multi-target single-hit model. D Flow cytometry was performed to detect apoptosis
  of stable overexpression and interference cell lines with or without treatment with
  4 Gy radiation. E Cell cycle progression was analyzed by flow cytometry. ns not
  significant, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001

  tumor immunogenicity via cGAS/STING/IFNs pathway in colorectal cancer.
