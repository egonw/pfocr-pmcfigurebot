caption: JGCs inhibited breast cancer tumorigenesis through the JAK2/STAT3 signaling
  pathway. (a) The top 20 biological processes were enriched using Metascape. (b)
  The top 20 KEGG pathways were identified using Metascape. (c,d) Western blot analysis
  of p-JAK2, JAK2, p-STAT3, and STAT3 in breast cancer cells after 24 h of treatment
  with JGCs. GAPDH was used as a loading control. Each experiment was repeated at
