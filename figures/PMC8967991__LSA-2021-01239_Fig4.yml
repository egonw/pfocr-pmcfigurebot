figure_title: Depletion of ESCRT-I induces prolonged activation of TFEB/TFE3 signaling
caption: (A) Western blots showing levels of TFEB and TFE3 proteins in whole-cell
  lysates (W) and nuclear fractions (N) of RKO cells depleted of Tsg101 or Vps28 (siTsg101#2,
  siVps28#2), as compared to control cells (treated with nontargeting siRNA, Ctrl#1).
  To examine the fraction purity, the levels of vinculin (cytosolic marker) were probed.
  The H3 histone protein was used as a loading control for nuclear fractions. (B)
  qPCR results showing the expression of MiT-TFE target genes upon ESCRT-I and/or
  MiT-TFE depletion (using single siRNAs for Tsg101, Vps28, TFEB, or TFE3) presented
  as fold changes with respect to control cells. Values derived from independent experiments
  and their means (n = 4 ± SEM) are presented. Statistical significance tested by
  comparison to siTsg101 or siVps28 conditions. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001.
  (C) Maximum intensity projection confocal images of fixed RKO cells at 48 or 72
  h post transfection (hpt) showing intracellular distribution of TFEB or TFE3 (green)
  in ESCRT-I–depleted or control RKO cells. Cell nuclei marked with DAPI (blue). Dot
  plots on the right show percentage of cells with nuclear TFEB or TFE3 localization.
  Values derived from independent experiments (dots) and their means (n = 4 ± SEM)
  are presented. Statistical significance tested by comparison to siCtrl#1 and/or
  siTsg101#2 conditions. ns, nonsignificant (P ≥ 0.05), **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001,
  ****P < 0.0001.
