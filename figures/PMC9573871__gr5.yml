caption: BAG3 activates the cell cycle, mTOR and TGF-β signaling pathway. (A‒C) GSEA
  plot showed that BAG3 expression was associated with cell cycle and mTOR pathway
  and TGF-β signaling pathway. (D) Western blot was performed to detect the expression
  of mTOR and TGF-β1 after transfection of BAG3, BAG3+miR-mimics and si-BAG3, BAG3+miR-inhibitors
  into MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, respectively.
