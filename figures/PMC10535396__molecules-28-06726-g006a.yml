caption: 'The mRNA expression of (a) Nrf2, (b) GST, (c) NQO1, (d) GCLC, (e) SOD1,
  (f) SOD2, (g) HO-1 and (h) catalase in the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway. Control:
  untreated cells; H2O2: cells induced with 300 μM hydrogen peroxide for 4 h; PMEE
  + H2O2: cells pre-treated with PMEE for 48 h + 4 h exposure to H2O2; CUR+H2O2: cells
  pre-treated with curcumin for 48 h + 4 h exposure to H2O2; PMEE: cells treated with
  only PMEE; CUR: cells treated with only curcumin. The value represents fold changes
  between control (untreated cells) and treatment groups. Data were expressed as the
  mean ± SD of triplicate experiments; values with different letters alphabets are
  significantly different from one another and vice versa (p < 0.05).'
