caption: Effect of IL-6 on specific pathway target genes of hPDLSCs in vitro upon
  inhibition of crucial osteogenic-regulating pathways. (A) Schematic presentation
  of the experiment. To explore the relevance of potential regulating pathways, the
  effects of IL-6 (20 ng/mL) on specific pathway target genes expressed by hPDLSCs
  upon inhibition of crucial osteogenic-regulating pathways (canonical Wnt, non-canonical
  Wnt, TGF-β1, and Notch pathways) were analyzed. Dkk-1, SP600125, SB431542, and DAPT
  were used to block the canonical Wnt, non-canonical Wnt, TGF-β1, and Notch signaling
  pathways, respectively. Effects of IL-6 (20 ng/mL) on specific pathway target genes
  expressed by hPDLSCs upon treatment with each specific inhibitor of the (B) canonical
  Wnt, (C) non-canonical Wnt, (D) TGF-β1, and (E) Notch signaling pathways. Gene expression
  was quantified by RT-qPCR (n = 4). Superscript letters indicate significant differences
  vs. the undifferentiated control (a), osteogenic control (b), and osteogenic induction
  (IL-6 at 20 ng/mL) upon specific inhibitor treatment (c) (p < 0.05).
