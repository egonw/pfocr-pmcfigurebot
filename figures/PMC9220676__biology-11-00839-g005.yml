caption: A dot plot illustration of the metabolic pathway enrichment in a joint analysis
  of significantly differentially expressed genes and important metabolites from transcriptome
  and metabolome data, respectively. Various metabolic pathways in the upper and left
  quadrants are labeled. The dot sizes increase with the increasing pathway impact;
  the color intensifies according to the y-axis.
