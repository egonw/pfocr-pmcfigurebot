caption: IFI35 knockdown therapeutic efficacy depended on autophagy induction. IFI35
  knockdown Ketr-3 or 786-O cells were treated with or without inhibitor 3-MA. (A,B)
  Forty-eight hours after 3-MA treatment, the levels of LC3-I, LC3-II, Becline-1,
  and ATG5 were measured by Western blot in Ketr-3 and 786-O cells. (C) RTCA cell
  proliferation assay was performed in renal cancer cells. (D) The invasion of renal
  cancer cells was detected by the trans-well assay. In 786-O-shRNA cell-xenografted
  nude mice, the inhibitor 3-MA was administrated intraperitoneally. (E) At 45 days
  after tumor inoculation, the present images of tumor excised from mice were presented.
  (F) Tumor inhibition rate. (G) The showed schematic illustration how the knockdown
  of IFI35 could inhibit renal cancer tumor growth. Knockdown of IFI35 by shRNA in
  renal cancer cells resulted in the activation of the STAT1/STAT6 phosphorylation
  pathway, then activated the pSTAT1/pSTAT6-mediated autophagy by up-regulating the
  autophagy-related gene expression (Beclin-1, LC3-II, and ATG-5) and increasing the
  ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I, and eventually led to autophagy-mediated tumor inhibition.
  The experiments were performed with five mice per group. Data are from one representative
  experiment of three performed and presented as the mean Â± SD. Statistical significance
  was set at ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001. Original blots see .
