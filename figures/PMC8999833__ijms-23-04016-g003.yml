caption: Dissection of gcHap-network pathway of important drought and salt co-response
  genes. These gene-related pathways and elite haplotypes for drought and salt co-response
  genes are indicated in the blue box. Firstly, OsAUX1, OsPYL5, and OsbZIPs (3 genes)
  were enriched in osa04075 that mainly included the auxin (AUX), ABA, and salicylic
  acid (SA) related pathways. The two rice auxin receptor genes OsTIR1 and OsAFB2
  were targeted by OsmiR393, and the MYB transcription factor MYB77 interacted with
  both IAA19 and ARFs. H2O2 has been found to be involved in the morphogenesis of
  ARF. ABA occupies an important position in plant growth and plant development, and
  the components of the ABA signaling pathway mainly include OsPYLs, OsPP2C, OsSAPKs,
  and some transcription factors (TFs). Secondly, RNA secondary structure was influenced
  via the osa03040 or another pathway, which changed the activity and expression of
  HSF associated genes. Moreover, OsHSPs are associated with primary metabolism and
  signal transduction. Thirdly, the interaction of the Ca2+ and ROS signaling pathways
  has an important role in the regulatory network of plant immunity. Component changes
  in the MAPK cascade pathway were influenced by the activation of the ROS pathway.
  The PYL-PP2C-SnRK2 core ABA-signaling module activates a MAPK cascade, which may
  regulate many ABA effector proteins through phosphorylation. The MAPK cascade could
  also be activated by the PYL-PP2C-SnRK2 core ABA signaling module, which regulates
  ABA-related proteins through phosphorylation.
