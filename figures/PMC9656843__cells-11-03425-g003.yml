caption: 'Plasma concentrations of (A) alanine aminotransferase (ALT), (B) alanine
  aspartate (AST), and (C) total bilirubin. (D) Representative microscopic findings
  of liver stained with hematoxylin–eosin (×200) and (E) parameters of Suzuki score
  (congestion, necrosis and vacuolation). (F) Parameters of NAFLD activity score (steatosis,
  inflammation, and ballooning degeneration). Data were obtained from 6 mice in each
  group and presented as mean ± standard deviation. ND: normal diet group. HFD: high-fat
  diet group. HFr/HFD: high-fat diet plus 30% fructose in drinking water group. NAFLD:
  non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. * p < 0.05, versus the ND group; † p < 0.05,
  the HFr/HFD group versus the HFD group.'
