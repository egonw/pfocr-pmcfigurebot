caption: Overexpression of ANKRD29 repressed NSCLC cell migration. A Representative
  photograph demonstrating the morphological change of H1975 after ANKRD29 overexpression
  in bright field. B-C SPC-A1 and H1975 cells’ migration abilities were inhibited
  after the overexpression of ANKRD29 by wound-healing assays. (C) Quantification
  data for (B). D-E ANKRD29 Overexpression suppressed SPC-A1 and H1975 cells’ migration
  abilities by trans-well assays. F The expressions level of EMT-related protein Slug
  and Snail were determined by Western blotting. G IC50 values were determined by
  SRB assays in ANKRD29 overexpressing cell and control group of SPC-A1. Scale bar
  = 50 μm. Bars are the mean value ± SD. ns = no significant. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01,
  *** P < 0.001
