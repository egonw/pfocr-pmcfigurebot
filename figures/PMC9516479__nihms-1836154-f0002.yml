figure_title: Characterization of EGFR inhibitor-induced ATM pathway activation
caption: A. Immunoblotting of various DNA damage response markers in PC9 cells following
  24h treatment with gefitinib at the indicated doses. B. Immunoblot of PC9 cells
  following treatment with the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib (100 nM), AZD0156 (pharmacological
  inhibitor of ATM, 1.5 μM), or the combination of both EGFRi and ATMi for 24h. C.
  Immunoblot of PC9 cells treated with increasing concentrations of gefitinib for
  24h. D. Immunoblot following treatment of PC9 cells with 100nM gefitinib for the
  indicated lengths of time. E. Immunoblot of 24h, 100 nM gefitinib-treated cells
  following CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of BIM or RNAi-mediated short hairpin (shRNA)
  knockdown of BAK/BAX in PC9 cells. F. Immunoblot of PC9 cells treated with pan-caspase
  inhibitor Q-VD-OPh (2 μM), gefitinib (500 nM), or the combination for 24h. G. Immunoblot
  of PC9 cells following CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of caspase 3, 7, or 3+7, post
  24h, 100 nM gefitinib treatment. H. Immunoblot of 24h gefitinib-treated PC9 cells,
  revealing ICAD loss. I. Immunoblot of 24h, 100 nM gefitinib-treated cells following
  CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockdown of CAD in PC9 cells. J. Immunoblot of 24h, 100 nM
  gefitinib-treated cells following CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of CAD in EGFR inhibitor-resistant
  cells. K. Confocal microscopy images of Rad51 loading assay in PC9 cells following
  treatment with 100 nM gefitinib, Q-VD-OPh (2 μM) or the combination for 24h with
  and without the presence of CAD. L. Bar graph quantification of images in (K). N=3
  for all groups presented, where the mean ± S.E.M is plotted. P values were determined
  using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test. * refers to P<0.05.
