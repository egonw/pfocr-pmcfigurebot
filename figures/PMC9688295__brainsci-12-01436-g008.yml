caption: 'The GABAARα1-TLR4 signal regulates epilepsy–migraine comorbidity. (A) Significant
  differences in latency of epilepsy were observed between comorbidity (n = 3) and
  comorbidity + Muscimol (n = 3, ** p < 0.01), comorbidity + TAK-242 (n = 3) and comorbidity
  + Muscimol (n = 3, ** p < 0.01). No significant difference between comorbidity and
  comorbidity + TAK-242. (B) Application of Muscimol reduces the Racine scale level
  of epilepsy in comorbidity (n = 3, * p < 0.05). The amount of head scratching (C)
  and facial mechanical withdrawal threshold (D) were evaluated, and phenotype improvements
  were detected from comorbidity + TAK-242 (n = 3) and comorbidity + Muscimol rats
  (n = 3, ** p < 0.01). C: comorbidity.'
