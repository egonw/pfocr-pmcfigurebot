caption: The effects of amino acid deprivation on mTORC1/S6K1 activity in SKOV3-TR
  cells. (A) SKOV3-TR cells were cultured in media deprived of each of the 20 amino
  acids. Using immunoblotting, the expression levels of S6K and S6 proteins and their
  phosphorylation were analyzed in culture conditions deprived of arginine, glutamine,
  lysine, and glycine. (B) SKOV3-TR cells were cultured in glutamine-deprived conditions
  for the indicated times. The expression levels of the mTOR, S6K, and S6 proteins
  were detected by immunoblotting. (C,D) SKOV3-TR cells were cultured in glutamine-deprived
  medium for 12 h and then supplemented with glutamine, and they were further incubated
  for the indicated times. (C) Live cells were counted using trypan blue staining.
  (D) The expression of mTOR, S6K, and S6 proteins and their phosphorylation were
  measured by immunoblotting. (E,F) SKOV3-TR cells were cultured in medium deprived
  of glutamine for 12 h and then supplemented with α-KG at the indicated doses for
  48 h. (E) Cell viabilities were measured by MTT assay. (F) The expression of mTOR,
  S6K, and S6 proteins and their phosphorylation were analyzed by immunoblotting.
  Protein expression was quantified as fold changes with respect to the control after
  normalization of respective β-actin levels using ImageJ software. The data are presented
  as the mean percentage of control ± SD relative to the control (n = 3, *** p < 0.001).
  CM, complete media; PTX, paclitaxel; α-KG, α-ketoglutarate.
