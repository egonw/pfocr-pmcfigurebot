caption: Intracellular mediators of the Imd pathway are required for NF‐κB activation
  in response to hypoxia, while the receptor PGRP is not. (A) Adult control flies
  daGal4, mutant LUBEL∆RBR and PGRP∆5 flies and double‐mutant LUBEL∆RBR;PGRP∆5 flies
  were subjected to low oxygen conditions (5% O2), and their survival was monitored
  over time. Error bars indicate SEM from more than 3 independent experimental repeats.
  (B) Adult wild‐type CantonS flies and mutant fly lines of the Imd pathway mediators
  Tak12, Diap27c, Key4/WT and DreddL23 were subjected to low oxygen conditions (5%
  O2), and their survival was monitored over time. Error bars indicate SEM from more
  than 5 independent experimental repeats. (C, D) Adult wild‐type CantonS flies and
  mutant fly lines of the Imd pathway mediators PGRP∆5, Tak12, Diap27c, Key4/WT and
  DreddL23 were subjected to low oxygen conditions (5% O2) for 24 h. Relish and HIF
  activation was studied by analysing the expression of diptericin and ldh, respectively,
  with qPCR. Error bars indicate SEM from more than 4 independent experimental repeats.
  (E, F) Adult wild‐type CantonS flies and mutant Tak12 and Diap27c flies were subjected
  to low oxygen conditions (5% O2). M1‐Ub chains were isolated at denaturing conditions
  from fly lysates with M1‐TUBE. Ubiquitin chains from samples were analysed by Western
  blotting with α‐M1 and α‐pan‐Ub antibodies, equal loading was controlled with α‐Actin
  antibody, n = 3. Statistical significance was calculated using the two‐way ANOVA
  and the Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (A, B) or Student’s t‐test (C, D), ns
  nonsignificant, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.
