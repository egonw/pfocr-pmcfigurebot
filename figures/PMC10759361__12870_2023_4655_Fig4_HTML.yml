caption: Anthocyanin synthesis pathway and the expression of involved genes. a Anthocyanin
  synthesis pathway in Yunnan Camellia. Genes were annotated using the KEGG database.
  b Heatmap of ABP-related gene expression in TZM, SZT, and MN at different development
  stages. Genes labeled with a blue asterisk (*) show no significant difference in
  comparisons of any two groups, and unlabeled genes show significant differential
  expression between at least two groups (padj < 0.05)
