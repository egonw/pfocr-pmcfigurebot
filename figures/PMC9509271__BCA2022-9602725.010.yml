caption: Expression of Bad, Bax, Bcl-2, p53, and Cyt C in the activation of apoptotic
  cell death using flow cytometry in K562 cells. Percentage of pro- and antiapoptotic
  proteins expressed in K562 cells. Untreated Control, Std drug (Doxorubicin 5 µM/mL)
  treated cells, and IC50 concentration 113.54 µg/mL of CuO-TiO2-Chitosan-Berbamine
  nanocomposites treated cells, respectively, using BD FACS Calibur, BD Biosciences,
  CA, USA. Data are presented as the means ± SE of triplicate experiments. ∗P < 0.05
  vs. control.
