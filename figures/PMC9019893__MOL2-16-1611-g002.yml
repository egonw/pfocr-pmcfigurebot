caption: Stratification of follicular thyroid carcinoma and adenoma based on prototype
  analysed by DIA and the established spectral library. (A) Venn diagram shows 98.3%
  overlap of protein identification between FA and FTC. (B) The t‐SNE plot shows FA
  and FTC cannot be separated based on the expression of 7777 proteins. (C) Volcano
  plot highlights differentially expressed proteins with the threshold of |log2(fold
  change)| ≥ 1 and P value < 0.05. Red and orange points indicate upregulated proteins,
  while the light and dark blue points denote the downregulated proteins. Those six
  annotated points in light blue or orange are proteins with adjusted P values < 0.05.
  The red and dark blue points are overlapped with favourable/unfavourable prognosis
  genes of thyroid cancer acquired from TCGA transcriptomics data. (D) Protein expression
  plots for top six DEPs substantially dysregulated in FA and FTC. (E) Pathway enrichment
  analysis for 204 DEPs. Z‐score represents the degree of activation of the enriched
  pathway. (F) Unsupervised hierarchical clustering heatmap of Pearson correlation
  coefficients between every two samples on 31 proteins selected by geNetClassifier.
