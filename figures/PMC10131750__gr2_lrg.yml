caption: 'Naringenin biosynthesis: Naringenin is a citrus flavonoid chemically named
  as 2,3-dihydro-5,7-dihydroxy-2-(4 hydroxyphenyl)−4H-1-benzopyran-4-one. Naringenin
  distributed molecules are insoluble in water and are soluble in organic solvents,
  like alcohol. According to the flavonoids class, naringenin is classified as a flavanone,
  which derives from naringin or narirutin (its glycone precursor) hydrolysis. In
  fact, Naringenin occupies a central position as primary C15 intermediate in the
  flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. Overall, the metabolic pathway begains with phenylalanine
  ammonia-lysase (PAL). Naringenin is produced by the combination of the para-coumaroyl-CoA
  with three units of malonyl-CoA. Subsequently, para-coumaroyl-CoA is activated by
  CoA-dependent ligase in the universal phenylpropanoid pathway.'

  naringenin as a promising drug candidate against COVID-19.
