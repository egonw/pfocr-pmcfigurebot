caption: 'Morphology and expression of tight junction protein ZO-1 in IPEC-J2 cells.
  Cells were stained with antibodies for ZO-1 and detected by immuno-fluorescence
  after treatment. In the images that were collected, the nuclei showed blue fluorescence
  after counterstaining with DAPI, and ZO-1 exhibited green fluorescence around the
  nuclei. Scale bar: 200 Âµm.'
