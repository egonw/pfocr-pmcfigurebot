caption: MACF1 regulates MSCs osteogenic differentiation through TCF4/miR-335(A),
  Expression of MACF1, TCF4 and mir-335 in MSCs of ROSA26-MACF1f/f and ROSA26-MACF1f/fPrx1-cre
  mice, as detected by RT-PCR (mean ​± ​SD, ∗P ​< ​.05 ∗∗P ​< ​.01). MSCs were treated
  with or without TCF4 siRNA (siTCF4) (B), ALP activity of MSCs from ROSA26-MACF1
  f/f and ROSA26-MACF1f/fPrx1-cre mice was detected by ALP staining. MSCs were treated
  with or without TCF4 siRNA (siTCF4) (C), Quantification of relative integrated optical
  density (IOD) values of ALP staining using Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software (mean ​± ​SD,
  ∗P ​< ​.05 ∗∗P ​< ​.01, ∗∗∗P ​< ​.001) (D–E), Expression of BGLAP and DKK1 in MSCs
  of ROSA26-MACF1f/f and ROSA26-MACF1f/fPrx1-cre mice, as detected by Western blot
  and RT-PCR (mean ​± ​SD, ∗∗P ​< ​.01, ∗∗∗P ​< ​.001). MSCs were treated with or
  without TCF4 siRNA (si-TCF4) (F), Expression of MACF1, Tcf4 and miR-335–5p in primary
  MSCs of MACF1 conditional knockout mice, as detected by RT-PCR (mean ​± ​SD, ∗P ​< ​.05
  ∗∗P ​< ​.01).
