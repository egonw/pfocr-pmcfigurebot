caption: Ca2+ regulated pathway. The endogenous melanocortin 4‐receptor (MC4R) pathway
  is regulated by agonist α‐melanocyte‐stimulating hormone (MSH) and antagonist agouti‐related
  peptide (AgRP). Ca2+ ions are also important in the regulation of the MC4R pathway.
  α‐MSH, along with Ca2+, induces satiety and reduces food intake. This is regulated
  partly by closure of the potassium inward rectifying channel KIR7.1. Conversely,
  AgRP regulates orexigenic signals, also via the opening of the KIR7.1, in addition
  to other possible mechanisms
