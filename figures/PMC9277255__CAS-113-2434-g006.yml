caption: 'Impact of specific N‐glycans for detection of each disease by urological
  disease‐specific score. The upper graphs represent the impact of N‐glycan structures
  for the detection of each disease. Relative impact >0.5 is represented as a red
  bar. A dotted square in the lower Ig N‐glycan synthetic pathway shows the N‐glycan
  structure with relative impact >0.5 for each disease. N‐glycan structures are indicated
  by monosaccharide symbols: yellow circles, galactose (Gal); green circles, mannose
  (Man); blue squares, N‐acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc); red triangles, fucose (Fuc);
  and magenta diamonds, N‐acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). BCa, bladder cancer; BPH,
  benign prostatic hyperplasia; CRPC, castration‐resistant prostate cancer; GCT, germ
  cell tumor; HSPC, hormone‐sensitive prostate cancer; HV, healthy volunteer; RCC,
  renal cell carcinoma; US, urosepsis; UTI, urinary tract infection; UTUC, upper urinary
  tract urothelial cancer'
