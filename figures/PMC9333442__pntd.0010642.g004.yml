figure_title: EBIV affects specific gene expression patterns in intrathoracically
  infected mosquitoes
caption: Significantly upregulated (orange) and downregulated (blue) genes in EBIV-infected
  compared with mock-infected mosquitoes at 2 dpi (A) and 7 dpi (B). (C) Genes displaying
  differential responses in EBIV-infected mosquitoes at 2 and 7 dpi were determined
  via a scatter plot of expression changes. KEGG pathway analyses of DEGs at 2 dpi
  and 7 dpi are presented in (D) and (E), respectively. Enriched GO categories associated
  with DEGs at 2 dpi and 7 dpi are shown in (F) and (G), respectively.
