caption: 'Principles of cell competition in Drosophila and mice. (A) Left: In a Drosophila
  wing disc in which all cells are heterozygous for the Minute gene encoding a ribosomal
  protein, the cells proliferate as usual and the disc reaches normal size without
  incident. Right: In a Drosophila wing disc where most cells are WT but a small fraction
  are Minute+/−, the Minute heterozygous cells surrounded by WT cells are the “losers”
  of a cell competition and are forced to undergo apoptosis. The wing disc reaches
  normal size but contains only WT cells. (B) In mouse epiblasts, Yes‐associated protein
  (YAP)–transcriptional enhanced associate domain (TEAD) activity regulates the expression
  of pluripotency factors in the blastocyst. Any cells that fail to specify their
  lineage are deemed “unfit” and are eliminated through cell competition. (C) In mouse
  embryonic stem cells or epiblasts, cells expressing lower levels of Myc lose in
  a competition with Mychi cells and are eliminated by apoptosis. All cells in the
  developing embryo thereafter express high levels of Myc'
