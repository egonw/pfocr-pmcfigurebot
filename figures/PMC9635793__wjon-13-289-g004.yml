caption: The effects of metformin on EGF-activated PI3K/Akt/NF-κB pathway. Breast
  cancer cells were pretreated with or without 10 mmol/L metformin (a) or NAC (b)
  for 24 h and then exposed to 50 ng/mL EGF to evaluate the phosphorylation levels
  of Akt and NF-κB via Western blotting. (c) Cancer cells were treated with LY294002
  (10 µmol/L) and the activation of Akt and NF-κB were assessed via western blotting.
