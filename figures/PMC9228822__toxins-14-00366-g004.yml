caption: Functional analysis of DEGs in Cry1Ac-treated larvae as compared to the control
  larvae for each strain. (Aâ€“H) The top 10 pathways (p < 0.05) for the upregulated
  (A,C,E,G) or downregulated (B,D,F,H) genes in each strain in response to Cry1Ac
  exposure. The column indicates the number of DEGs related to each pathway. (I,J)
  Venn diagram analysis of the top 10 pathways enriched by upregulated (I) or downregulated
  (J) genes in the four strains after Cry1Ac exposure.
