caption: 4SC-202-induced differentially expressed genes are implicated in biological
  processes related to cell adhesion (blue), movement (red), immune processes (green),
  and cancer-related signaling pathways (orange). (a) Venn diagram of the intersection
  of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between workflows. (b) Directional
  consistency heatmap of the log2 fold change (LFC) between 4SC-202-treated tumors
  and vehicle-treated tumors for consensus DEGs across workflows. Annotations along
  the top of the heatmap indicate the workflow and experiment of origin. (c) Table
  of top 25 overrepresented GO biological processes for the consensus DEGs corrected
  for gene length using goseq. (d) Dotplot of the consensus enriched pathways across
  the three workflows. Adjusted p-value is indicated by dot color and the ratio of
  genes mapped to the pathway relative to (approximately) the total number of significant
  genes is indicated by the size of the dot. (e) Visualization of the DAVID functional
  annotation clusters of the pathways enriched in the 70 consensus DEGs. Node size
  and color is indicative of the cumulative enrichment score for the cluster, with
  larger nodes indicating a higher enrichment score. Edge weight is indicative of
  the extent to which the gene lists of the enriched terms overlap for the gene list
  of interest. More similar enrichment clusters (nodes) have a higher edge weight
  than poorly related clusters. (f) Enriched terms in the third DAVID functional annotation
  cluster. Gene ratio is expressed as a percent. FDR indicates the false discovery
  rate. Coloring of enriched terms on (c,d,f) indicates manually annotated groups
  of terms of interest.
