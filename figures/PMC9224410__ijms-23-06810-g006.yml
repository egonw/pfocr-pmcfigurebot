caption: Inflammatory pathways were identified in the METH-treated Tlr4−/− group by
  RNA-Seq analysis. (A) Principal component analysis; (B) Identification of DEGs using
  the histogram and scatter plot methods (|log2FC| ≥ 1, p-value < 0.05) in the METH-treated
  Tlr4−/− group compared to the METH-treated WT group. (C) KEGG functional annotation
  analysis for metabolic pathways. (D) KEGG enrichment analysis in the METH-treated
  Tlr4−/− mice. Inflammatory mediator regulation of TRP channels, Toll-like receptor
  signaling pathway, NF-κB signaling pathway and TNF signaling pathway were identified
  in METH-treated Tlr4−/− group.
