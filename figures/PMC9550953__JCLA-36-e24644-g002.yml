caption: CircPPP1R12A‐73aa enhanced the proliferation of A549 and H1299 cells by AKT
  signaling pathway. (A) Western blotting was used to detect YAP, TAZ, p‐NF‐κB, NF‐κB,
  p‐MAPK, MAPK, p‐STAT, STAT, p‐AKT, AKT and β‐Actin after Lv‐HA‐control, Lv‐HA‐circPPP1R12A,
  Lv‐HA‐circPPP1R12A‐Mut and Lv‐HA‐circPPP1R12A‐73aa transfection. (B–G) The quantitative
  analysis of YAP, TAZ, p‐NF‐κB, p‐MAPK, p‐STAT and p‐AKT protein expression in A549
  cells. (H and I) The viability of A549 and H1299 cells was confirmed by CCK‐8. The
  divided group was shown.
article_title: A peptide translated from circPPP1R12A promotes the malignancy of non‐small
  cell lung cancer cells through AKT signaling pathway.
