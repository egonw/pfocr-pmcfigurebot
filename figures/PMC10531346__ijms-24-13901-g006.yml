caption: Relative activities of the five oxidoreductases. The activity was compared
  based on the relative activity of the reductase of the highest activity. Dihydroflavonols
  are shown in red hues assigning the activity of SbDFR or PvDFRa as 100%, flavanones
  are shown in blue hues assigning SbDFR or PvDFRa as 100%, and anthocyanidins assigning
  SbANR as 100% are shown in green hues.

  4-Reductase, Flavanone 4-Reductase, and Anthocyanidin Reductase Offer Metabolic
  Flexibility in the Flavonoid Pathway.
