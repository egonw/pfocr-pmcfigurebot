caption: Selecting and validating characteristic genes (A, B) Investigation of the
  characteristic genes of the IL6/JAK/STAT signaling pathway (ISP) by the least absolute
  shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. (C, D) Investigation of the
  characteristic genes of the estrogen response pathway (ERP) by LASSO regression.
  (E) Nomogram based on the characteristic genes of ISP. (F) Validation of the diagnostic
  efficacy of STAT2 for intracranial aneurysm (IA) by the receiver operator characteristic
  (ROC)analysis. (G) Predictive accuracy of STAT2 for IA by the calibration curve.
  (H) Nomogram based on STAT2 as diagnostic tool for IA formation.
