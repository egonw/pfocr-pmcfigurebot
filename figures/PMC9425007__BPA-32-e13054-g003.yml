caption: Complement activation and dysregulation in the PMS thalamus. Quantification
  of the area of immunoreactivity of anti‐C1q (A), anti‐C4d (B), anti‐C3b (C) and
  anti‐Bb (D) in control, non‐lesion and lesion areas (lesion centre and edge of active,
  chronic active and demyelinating and chronic inactive lesions) revealed significant
  complement immunoreactivity at areas of active inflammatory demyelinating pathology
  in comparison to control or non‐lesion tissue. Complement classical pathway C1q
  and C4d were additionally elevated in the normal‐appearing (non‐lesion) PMS thalamus
  in comparison to control. In the same regions of interest, expression of the complement
  regulatory protein, C1‐inhibitor, was unchanged or significantly decreased (E) in
  comparison to the control thalamus. (F) Only a trend to an association was noted
  between the area of C3b immunoreactivity and wider measures of thalamic pathology
  (Spearman correlation analysis and Spearman r and p values shown). A centre, A edge,
  active lesion centre or edge sample; CA, chronic active; CI, chronic inactive. Kruskal‐Wallis
  multiple comparison test with Dunn's post‐test
