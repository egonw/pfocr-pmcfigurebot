caption: Putative representation proposed for the possible metabolic pathways where
  certain compounds with statistical difference (p < .05) may be involved. Each compound
  is represented by its ID number followed by the respective heatmap using a colour
  code to compare each condition (P. lusitanus NL19 TSB100% (PL100), P. himalayensis
  MTCC 6384 TSB100% (PH100), P. lusitanus NL19 PC25% (PL25), and P. himalayensis MTCC
  6384 PC25% (PH25)). Each condition is represented by a single-coloured square that
  results from the group average for each condition. The conditions that do not present
  statistical significance (p > .05) regarding to the respective sterile media are
  marked with (*). Blue dot marked arrows with ?? indicate hypothetical pathway

  coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry?.'
