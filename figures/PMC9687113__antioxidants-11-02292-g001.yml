caption: 'Risk factors of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and types of DNA damage and
  repair. (a) Risk factors of IPF: genetic predisposition factors, environmental exposures
  (wood, smoking, metal dust, etc.), comorbidities (gastroesophageal reflux disease,
  etc.), and infections (human herpes viruses, hepatitis C virus, etc.) (b) Diagram
  of DNA damage types and corresponding repair pathway: The mismatch repair (MMR)
  system maintains genome stability by repairing base mismatches during DNA replication.
  Abasic or AP (apurinic/apyrimidic) sites are cleaved by a DNA glycosylase in the
  base excision repair (BER) pathway. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) can eliminate
  the widest range of bulky adducts. When the DNA-double strand breaks, eukaryotic
  cells use two main processes to repair: homologous recombination (HR) and end-joining
  (EJ).'
