caption: 'Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) divert metabolites from tricarboxylic acid
  cycle (TCA) cycle to glycolysis under hypoxia. (a) Under normoxia, glucose is converted
  to pyruvate during glycolysis. Pyruvate is then converted to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA),
  which fuels the TCA cycle for maximum adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production with
  ample oxygen (O2) supply. (b) Under hypoxia, metabolism is switched from oxidative
  to glycolytic metabolism by HIF-dependent upregulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase
  kinase 1 (PDK1) and (lactate dehydrogenase A) LDHA. Lactate export is promoted to
  prevent excessive intracellular lactate accumulation, which may lead to cytoplasmic
  acidification. Serine synthesis pathway (SSP) and its downstream folate cycle are
  activated. Folate cycle produces a major antioxidant, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate (NADPH), to counteract oxidative stress under hypoxia. Mitochondrial activity
  and biogenesis are suppressed to reduce mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  production. Genes or pathways highlighted in red: upregulated by HIFs. Genes or
  pathways highlighted in blue: downregulated by HIFs.'
