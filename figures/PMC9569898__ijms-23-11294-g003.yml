caption: TGF-β1 was used to stimulate HESCs to construct an IUA cell model and detect
  the expression of KLB. (A) Western blot was used to detect the expression of Collagen
  I and FN in HESCs stimulated with TGF-β1 at the concentration of 10 ng/mL for 0,
  12, 24, and 48 h. It was found that the expression of Collagen I and FN increased
  in a statistically significant manner when treated with 10 ng/mL for 48 h. (B) The
  expression of Collagen I and FN in HESCs stimulated with TGFβ1 at the concentrations
  of 0, 2.5, 5, and 10 ng/mL for 48 h was detected by Western Blot. It was found that
  the expression of Collagen I and FN was significantly increased when the cells were
  treated with 5 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL. (C) The expression of KLB in HESCs stimulated
  with TGF-β1 at the concentration of 10 ng/mL was detected by Western Blot, and it
  was found that the expression of KLB increased after 48 h of TGF-β1 stimulation.
  (D) The expression of KLB in HESCs stimulated with TGF-β1 at the concentrations
  of 0, 2.5, 5, and 10 ng/mL for 48 h was detected by Western Blot. It was found that
  the expression of KLB in HESCs increased when the cells were stimulated with TGF-β1
  at the concentration of 10 ng/mL. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p ≤ 0.001.
