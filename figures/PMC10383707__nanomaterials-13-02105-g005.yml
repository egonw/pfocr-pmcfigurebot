caption: 'Gene expression changes in commonly perturbed pathways. Heatmaps resulting
  from hierarchical clustering of DEGs belonging to the pathway and bar graphs showing
  each RNA-seq data of key DEGs involved in the selected pathway. (A) Acute Phase
  Response Signaling. (B) Antioxidant Action of Vitamin C. (C) Tumor Microenvironment.
  Color bar indicates high-expressed (red) and low-expressed (blue) genes. N = 3 per
  time point. Bar graph shows the mean value of Transcripts per million (TPM) with
  individual data (dot). White bar graph: Control group. Gray bar graph: MWCNT-treated
  group. Animal numbers of the control group are as follows. C1-1, C1-3, C1-5: Year
  0.5; C2-1, C2-2, C2-4: Year 1; and C3-1, C3-2, C3-3: Year 2. Animal numbers of the
  MWCNT-treated group are as follows: M1-1, M1-2, M1-4: Year 0.5; M2-2, M2-3, M2-4:
  Year 1; M3-1, M3-3, M3-4: Year 2.'
