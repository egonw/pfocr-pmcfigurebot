caption: Functions of ICP34.5 in HSV-1 infected cells. Functions of ICP34.5 can be
  classified according to the cellular location of the protein, which shuttles between
  the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The amino and the carboxyl domains of ICP34.5 play
  different roles in infected cells. The C-terminus prevents the translational arrest
  by the binding of PP1α and the subsequent dephosphorylation of elF2α. The N-terminus
  is involved in the suppression of Beclin-1-autophagy, the degradation of the nuclear
  lamina to facilitate nucleocapsid egress from the nucleus, and the blockade of IFN
  response by the inhibition of the dsDNA-sensing pathway. The full-length protein
  plays a role in virus replication in non-dividing cells, in the prevention of DCs
  maturation, and in the suppression of the IFN response by blocking the RNA-sensing
  pathway.
