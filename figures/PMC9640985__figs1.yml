caption: 'miR-450b-5p and miR-299-3p promote CRC cell metastasis and invasion by directly
  suppressing DKK4 expression.A, qRT‒PCR and Western blot of DKK4 expression in Caco-2
  and HCT8 cells transfected with miR-450b-5p or miR-299-3p inhibitors and their controls.
  ∗∗p < 0.01. B, the DKK4 wild-type and mutant reporter plasmids were cotransfected
  with miR-450b-5p (above), miR-299-3p (below) inhibitor or the control. Luciferase
  activity values were measured. N.S., not significant. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01. C,
  transwell assay and corresponding data analyses showing the migration and invasion
  abilities of HCT116 cells transfected with miR-450b-5p or miR-299-3p mimics or the
  corresponding negative control. Scale bar: 200 μm. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01. D, transwell
  assay and corresponding data analyses showing the migration and invasion abilities
  of Caco-2 cells transfected with miR-450b-5p or miR-299-3p inhibitors or the corresponding
  negative control. Scale bar: 200 μm. ∗∗p < 0.01. E, transwell assay showing the
  migration and invasion abilities of Caco-2 cells transfected with LV-DKK4 in combination
  with or without miR-450b-5p or miR-299-3p mimics. Scale bars: 200 μm. ∗p < 0.05,
  ∗∗p < 0.01. F, the associations between DKK4 levels and miR-450b-5p (above) or miR-299-3p
  (below) expression in 9 paired CRC tissues measured by qRT‒PCR. ∗p < 0.05.'
