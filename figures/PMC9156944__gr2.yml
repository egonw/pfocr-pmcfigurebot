caption: eRNA analysis of GRO-seq data demonstrates a complex system of gene regulation
  in response to refeeding and changes in Akt signaling(A) Scatterplot of GRO-seq
  results comparing eRNA expression in livers of overnight fasted mice with that of
  mice that were overnight fasted and then refed normal chow for 2 h eRNA with an
  RPKM greater than 0.5 that are significantly upregulated in refeeding (at least
  2-fold increased) are highlighted in red, whereas downregulated genes (at least
  2-fold decreased) are highlighted in blue.(B) GREAT gene ontology analysis performed
  on the sets of up- and downregulated genes identified by the GRO-seq analysis. The
  top five biological processes for each group are shown. Each process is represented
  by two values; the first represents the number of eRNAs identified within it and
  the second is the number of genes associated with those eRNAs within this pathway.
  Example genes are shown for each pathway.(C) Heatmap of all the feeding-regulated
  genes identified in (A) and further results of GRO-seq from 2-h refed L-AktDKO and
  L-AktFoxo1TKO mice. Six clusters were identified, three from the feeding-stimulated
  eRNAs and three from the feeding-repressed that are differentially regulated by
  Akt and FoxO1.(D) GREAT gene ontology analysis performed on the 3 clusters of feeding-stimulated
  eRNAs, identified by how they appear to be regulated by Akt and FoxO1. Each process
  is represented by two values, the first represents the number of eRNAs identified
  within it and the second is the number of genes associated with those eRNAs within
  this pathway. Example genes are shown for each pathway. Graph color corresponds
  to cluster in (C).(E) GREAT gene ontology analysis performed on the 3 clusters of
  feeding-repressed eRNAs, identified by how they appear to be regulated by Akt and
  FoxO1. Each process is represented by two values; the first represents the number
  of eRNAs identified within it and the second is the number of genes associated with
  those eRNAs within this pathway. Example genes are shown for each pathway. Graph
  color corresponds to cluster in (C).
