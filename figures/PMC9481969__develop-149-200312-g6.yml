caption: 'Integrated comparison of gene expression pattern similarity across Wnt,
  Fzd and other pathway component genes. (A) E11.5 example of the visual analysis
  carried out; all virtual sections are identical, mid-sagittal. The top row shows
  the territories where zero Wnts are detected (0 Wnt), where individual Wnt genes
  are expressed uniquely (1 Wnt), where 2 or more (2+ Wnts) or 3 or more (3+ Wnts)
  genes are co-expressed and where canonical Wnt pathway read-out is detected (Tcf/Lef-GFP).
  Rows 2 and 3 represent mapped expression of each of the Wnt family genes as indicated.
  The analysis included viewing the full set of sections in all orientations and across
  stages. (Bi) Network diagrams representing the similarities between Wnt expression
  pattern across time. The lines connecting nodes represent the JI of similarity (intersection/union),
  with thickness scaled as shown. Each ‘node’ represents a Wnt gene as indicated (e.g.
  3a=Wnt3a). For comparison of the network, thresholds were adjusted to show the 15
  genes with expression patterns most similar to other Wnt genes at each stage. Blue
  circles enclose the group with most highly similar expression patterns, consistent
  across stages (Group 1). Red circles enclose the most divergent expression patterns
  (Group 3). (Bii) Visual illustration of the nature of the lines connecting genes
  in the network focussing on the most highly connected genes at E10.5; Wnt3, 3a,
  4 and 10a. The mapped Wnt expression patterns are shown here in projection through
  a 3D view of the reference model embryo, at each corner of the network (as indicated).
  Intersection domains, where each pair of expression patterns intersect, are shown
  on the lines connecting that gene pair. (C) Top 34 similarity scores among all Wnt
  genes across stages. The horizontal axis refers to JI (red, E11.5; yellow, E10.5;
  blue, E9.5). (D) Domains of multiple Fzd expression patterns (2+ Fzds) correspond
  well to territories of canonical pathway read-out (Tcf/Lef-GFP). Fzd expression
  patterns fall within two classes: class 1 (row 2) are similar to canonical read-out,
  Tcf/Lef transcription factor and Sfrp family member expression patterns (row 1,
  right). Example patterns at E11.5 are shown.'
