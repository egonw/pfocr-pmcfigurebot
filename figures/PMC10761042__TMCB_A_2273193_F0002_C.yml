caption: Predicted structure of PTP1B in complex with some of the putative substrates
  identified by SILAC-based phosphoproteomics. (A) Visualization of the complex of
  Cdk3 (yellow) and the catalytic domain of PTP1B (grey). The catalytic residue Cys215
  of PTP1B and pTyr15 of Cdk are indicated in green and red, respectively. (B) Closer
  view of the PTP1B-Cdk3 interaction. The distance between pTyr15 of Cdk3 and Cys215
  of PTP1B is indicated. (C) Visualization of the complex of IR β (yellow) and PTP1B
  (grey). The catalytic residue Cys215 indicated in green is close to IR β pTyr1146
  indicated in red. (D) Closer view of the PTP1B-IR β interaction. The distance between
  Cdk3 pTyr1146 and PTP1B Cys215 is indicated. (E) Visualization of the complex of
  DOK1 (yellow) and PTP1B (grey). The catalytic residue Cys215 indicated in green
  is close to DOK1 pTyr362 indicated in red. (F) Closer view of the PTP1B-DOK1 interaction.
  The distance between DOK1 pTyr362 and PTP1B Cys215 is indicated.(G) Visualization
  of the complex of EphA (yellow) and PTP1B (gray). The catalytic residue Cys215 indicated
  in green is close to EphA pTyr205 indicated in red. (F) Closer view of the PTP1B-EphA
  interaction. The distance between EphA pTyr205 and PTP1B Cys215 is indicated.
