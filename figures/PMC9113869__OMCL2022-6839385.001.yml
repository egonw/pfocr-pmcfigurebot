caption: 'AKG therapy enhanced neurological effects and reduced infarct volumes in
  MCAO mice. (a) AKG''s molecular structure. (b) Effects of AKG on neurological function
  in mice following cerebral I/R (n = 6). (c) TTC staining was employed to approach
  the area of brain infarction in mice. (d) ImageJ analysis system was used to examine
  the infarct regions (n = 6). ∗∗P < 0.01 versus the sham group and ##P < 0.01 versus
  the MCAO group.'
