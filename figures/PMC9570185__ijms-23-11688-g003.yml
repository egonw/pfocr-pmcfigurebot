caption: 'Biological origin of the candidate oxylipins discriminating participants
  with MetS. Metabolic pathway showing all oxylipins (n = 54) and the fatty acids
  (n = 25) (represented by circles and squares, respectively) measured in the Discovery
  and Replication cross-sectional studies. Pathways of oxylipins biosynthesis derived
  from omega-6 PUFAs (a), omega-3 PUFAs (b) and SFA/MUFAs (c). The oxylipins selected
  in the Discovery and Replication studies (candidates oxylipins n = 29) are highlighted
  in color. Differences in concentration between controls and MetS participants in
  the Discovery study are highlighted in red (higher concentration in CardMetS group
  vs. Control), green (lower concentration in CardMetS group vs. Control) or gray
  (no difference). Dash lines represent indirect pathways including intermediate metabolites.
  Size of nodes represents the fold change between the two groups. Significant oxylipins
  from Wilcoxon signed-rank are represented by a star. LA: Linoleic Acid; GLA: γ-Linolenic
  Acid; DGLA: Dihomo-γ-Linolenic Acid; AA: Arachidonic Acid; AdA: Adrenic Acid; DPA:
  Docosapentaenoic Acid; ALA: α-Linolenic Acid; EPA: Eicosapentaenoic Acid; DHA: Docosahexaenoic
  Acid; PUFA: PolyUnsaturated Fatty Acids; SFA: Saturated Fatty Acids; MUFA: MonoUnsaturated
  Fatty Acids.'
