caption: Protein-RNA correlations across cancer types.A, outline of the analysis in
  this study. Transcriptomic and proteomic data were obtained from eight CPTAC studies
  spanning eight different cancer types. The number of patients and proteins used
  in each analysis are included in . B, boxplots show the gene-wise protein-RNA Spearman
  rank correlations in eight cancer types. C, separation of the proteomic data to
  functional pathways, as annotated by GO and KEGG, shows marked differences in protein–RNA
  correlations within different pathways. Ribosomes, proteasomes, and oxidative phosphorylation
  show the lowest correlations, and type I interferon (IFN) pathway shows the highest
  protein–RNA correlations. D, hierarchical clustering of protein-RNA correlations
  of selected pathways shows high variation among pathway components, between different
  proteins and between tumor types. HR, homologous recombination; NER, nucleotide
  excision repair; NHEJ, non-homologous end joining; OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation;
  RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase.
