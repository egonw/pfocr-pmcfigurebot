caption: Metabolite changes as a result of treatment with vemurafenib, SGI-1776 and
  combination. A Venn diagrams comparing the drug responsive metabolites identified
  in PTC in the indicated comparisons. B Differential expression of the metabolites
  in  between the vemurafenib, SGI-1776, and combination groups. *P < 0.5⁎⁎P < 0.01⁎⁎⁎P

  analyses (P < 0.05, impact > 0.1), using MetaboAnalyst, of the metabolites that
  were significantly altered in PTC cells treated with (C) vemurafenib, (D) SGI-1776,
  and (E) combination. The x-axis represents the pathway impact score, which is the
  relative degree to which the overall pathway is expected to be altered given the
  relative (positional) importance of altered metabolites in the pathway. The y-axis
  represents the -log10-transformed P values for pathway enrichment. Nodes are colored
  according to P value and sized according to pathway impact score.
