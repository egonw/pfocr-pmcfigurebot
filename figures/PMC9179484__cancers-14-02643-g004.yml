caption: Romidepsin affects acetyl-CoA availability (a) 620 metabolites were quantified
  in A549 and ACHN cell lines after 18 h romidepsin treatment (clinical dosing), and
  the top 15 enriched metabolic pathways were obtained after enrichment pathway analysis
  on significantly modified compounds (Welsh’s t-test). p-values for pathway scores
  were calculated using hypergeometric test. (b) 620 metabolites were quantified after
  treatment with romidepsin (clinical dosing) for 12 h, 18 h and 18 h in combination
  with MEKi, and those involved in β-oxidation, glutaminolysis and TCA cycle were
  overlaid on TCA cycle fueling pathway representation (median fold change). Letters
  refer to enzymes whom expression was quantified by microarray analysis, and for
  which results are presented in . Statistical difference between control and treated
  groups was evaluated by Welsh’s t-test (c) Acetyl-CoA levels were quantified by
  mass spectrometry in four cell lines following 18 h romidepsin treatment. Data are
  plotted as mean ± SD, and statistical difference was assessed using an unpaired
  two-tailed Student’s t-test. (d). Cells were treated for 18 h with romidepsin, then
  incubated for 1 h in medium without glucose and glutamine, and then variation in
  OXPHOS (OCR) was measured by Seahorse analysis while either glutamine, cell permeant-glutamate,
  cell permeant-αKG or pyruvate was subsequently added, followed by oligomycin A.
  (e) Metabolites involved in cytoplasmic redox balance downstream of the TCA cycle
  are represented, including the GSH recycling step requiring NADPH to reconvert GSSG
  (oxidized glutathione) to GSH (reduced glutathione) (see (b) for detailed legend
  information). Numbers refer to enzymes for which expression levels are presented
  in . In (b,c,e), * indicates a p-value < 0.05.
