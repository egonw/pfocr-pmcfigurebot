caption: 'Dysregulated molecular pathways in VaD according to cell type‐specific transcriptomic
  changes. UMAP plots and bar plots (A) showing the proportions of the major cell
  types found in the VaD, VaDadj and NC PVWM samples. (B and C) VaD and VaDadj‐ associated
  transcriptomic changes were highly cell type‐specific. (B) Numbers of DEGs between
  VaD, VaDadj and NC samples within each cell type (adjusted p < 0.001, log fold change
  ≥0.25 or ≤−0.25). Down: down‐regulated; Up: up‐regulated. (C) Venn diagram showing
  the coregulated DEGs among cell types. (D and E) the cell type‐specific transcriptomic
  changes in VaD were associated with distinct molecular pathways. (D) Table showing
  the specific GO terms in cell types in VaD samples. (E) Heatmap showing molecular
  pathways activation using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. Astro, astrocytes;
  Neu, neurons; OPC, oligodendrocyte progenitor cell; Oligo, oligodendrocyte; Mur,
  mural cells; Endo, endothelial cells; Mic, microglia; Macro, macrophage. All data
  are mean ± SEM. See also Figures  and Table'
