figure_title: Repression of the RIG-I/MDA-5 signaling pathway in ATRX knockdown HFFs
caption: 'Stable ATRX knockdown HFFs (siATRX) and respective control cells (siC) were
  treated with (A) 0.5 μg/ml poly(I:C) HMW and poly(I:C) LMW, (B) 0.5 μg/ml poly(I:C)
  HMW or (C) 0.1 μg/ml poly(I:C) HMW for 24 h. (A) Cells were harvested for Western
  blotting to determine the phosphorylation of IRF3 and TBK1; β-actin served as internal
  loading control. Signal intensities were quantified relative to poly(I:C) HMW-treated
  siC cells (lane 2). The following antibodies were used: anti-ATRX (39-f), anti-phospho-IRF3
  (Ser386) (EPR2346), anti-IRF3 (D6I4C), anti-phospho-TBK1 (Ser172) (D52C2), anti-TBK1
  (D1B4), anti-β-actin (AC-15). (B) Total RNAs were prepared and RT-qPCR was performed
  to determine IFNB1 induction. Depicted values were calculated from triplicates relative
  to untreated siC cells using GAPDH as a housekeeping gene and are shown as mean
  ± SD. One out of two independent experiments is shown. Statistical analysis was
  performed with respective ΔCq-values using a student’s t-test (unpaired, two-tailed);
  *p<0.05. (C) Supernatants were harvested and mixed with HEK-Blue IFN-α/β cells.
  Type I IFNs in the supernatants were quantitated by measuring SEAP activity produced
  by HEK-Blue IFN-α/β cells using QUANTI-Blue. Depicted values were derived from triplicates
  and are shown as mean ± SD. Statistical analysis was performed using a student’s
  t-test (unpaired, two-tailed); ***p<0.001.'
