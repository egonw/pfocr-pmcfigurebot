caption: Roles of cytokines and signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of multiple
  myeloma. Cytokines and growth factors have been secreted in the bone marrow microenvironment
  such as IL‐6, IGF‐1, BAFF, APRIL, TNF‐α, and VEGF. These soluble factors activate
  signaling pathways, including the NF‐κB pathway, PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, JAK/STAT
  pathway, and MAPK pathway, which regulate the survival, proliferation, apoptosis,
  migration, adhesion, and drug resistance of myeloma cells
