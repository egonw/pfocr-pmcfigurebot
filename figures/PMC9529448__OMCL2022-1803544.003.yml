caption: NLRC4/CASP1/CASP4/GSDMD signaling axis genes in TCGA cohort have similar
  expression patterns and jointly affect overall survival. (a) Kaplan–Meier plots
  for the OS of patients with different CASP gene expression in TCGA cohort, using
  the median expression of each gene as a cutoff point to divide the high- and low-expression
  groups. (b) Scatter plot of the correlation between the GSDMD gene and the expression
  of three caspase genes in TCGA cohort. The degree of correlation was examined using
  Spearman's coefficient. (c) Univariate Cox analysis of the effects of GSDMD, CASP4,
  and CASP1 and their upstream inflammasome gene expression on overall survival. Genes
  with p < 0.05 were selected for multivariate Cox analysis. Hazard ratios are presented
  as forest plots. (d) Pathway enrichment of DEGs between the GSDMD high- and low-expression
  groups using Metacore and visualization of CASP1 upstream gene hits. The red thermometer
  indicates the Log2FC of different genes. (e, f) Expression levels of CASP1, CASP4,
  and NLRC4 genes in patients with different WHO grades and IDH mutation phenotypes
  in TCGA cohort. (g) Representative sections of matched GSDMD-N and NLRC4 immunohistochemistry
  from normal brain tissue and different grades of glioma samples. (h, i) Semiquantitative
  results of GSDMD-N and NLRC4 staining levels in tissue microarrays. Statistics were
  calculated using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in (f). Statistics were calculated
  using two-tailed, unpaired Student's t-test with Welch's correction in (e, h, i).
