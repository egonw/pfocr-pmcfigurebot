caption: Flowchart of the bioinformatic pipeline for the dual RNA-seq analysis of
  a host–pathogen interaction. The pipeline starts with data pre-processing and differential
  gene expression analysis following by Fuzzy clustering to decipher coherent patterns
  of temporal gene expression profiles. The pathway enrichment analysis was applied
  using KEGG and GO annotations to identify functions overrepresented by temporal
  clusters in host and pathogen (based on Fisher’s exact test with hypergeometric
  null hypothesis). To explore relationship and potential physical or regulatory interactions
  among differentially expressed genes, the protein–protein interaction (PPI) for
  both species and regulatory networks for pathogens were retrieved from different
  datasets. The topological characteristics of the genes were then identified. Additionally,
  the gene co-expression networks were constructed to infer cross-species gene associations
  and then used to identify hubs, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality and
  modularity followed by functional analysis.
