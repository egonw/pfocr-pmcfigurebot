caption: '(A) TGFβ signaling pathway with TGFβ1 and BMP signaling arm-specific receptors
  and inhibitors tSMADi (dark blue), Noggin (turquoise), and DMH1 (orange). (B) Generation
  of fibroblast-derived iNs in three different neuronal conversion media (tSMADi,
  +Noggin, and +DMH1) over 21 days. (C) Brightfield images of CL01 before (D-1) and
  after (D0) pool split, and during (D7, D14, and D21) conversion in three different
  neuronal conversion media (tSMADi, +Noggin, and +DMH1). Scale bars: 50 μm. DMH1,
  dorsomorphin homolog 1.'
