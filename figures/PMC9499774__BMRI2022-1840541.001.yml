caption: Determination of index compounds in SH005S7 by HPLC analysis and the effect
  of SH005S7 downregulating the RTK signaling pathway in gefitinib-resistant lung
  cancer cells. Peaks of standard compounds were identified as shown. (a) Characterization
  of fisetin in the SH005S7 formula (top panel) using pure fisetin as standard (lower
  panel). (b) Decursin in SH005S7 (top panel) using pure decursin as standard (lower
  panel). (c) Morusin in SH005S7 (top panel) using pure morusin as standard (lower
  panel). (d) SH005S7 suppresses expression of EGFR, MET, and HER3 in both HCC827
  and HCC827GR cells. Cells were treated with vehicle, 200, and 500 μg/mL SH005S7
  for 72 hours. The results from three independent experiments.
