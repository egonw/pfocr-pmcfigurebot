caption: Knockdown of circ‐EIF3I inhibited LC cell progression. A549 and H1299 cells
  were transfected with si‐NC or si‐circ‐EIF3I. (a) The expression of circ‐EIF3I was
  detected by qRT‐PCR. MTT assay (b), (c), colony formation assay (d), flow cytometry
  (e), and transwell assay (f), (g) were used to measure the viability, colony number,
  apoptosis, migration, and invasion of cells. **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.
  LC, lung cancer; qRT‐PCR, quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction
article_title: Circ‐EIF3I facilitates proliferation, migration, and invasion of lung
  cancer via regulating the activity of Wnt/β‐catenin pathway through the miR‐1253/NOVA2
  axis.
