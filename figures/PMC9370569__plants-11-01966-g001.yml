caption: Relative expression of genes involved in the nodulation process. RT-qPCR
  experiments were performed with root RNAs from 2-, 5-, or 12-day-old seedlings grown
  in MS without NO3− or with 1 mM or 10 mM NO3−, with [R(+)] or without Rhizobium
  [R(–)] using actin and β-tubulin as reference genes. PsNSP1, nodulation signaling
  pathway; PsHAP2.1, transcription factor of the CCAAT-binding family; PsNPF7.1, (NRT1/PTR
  Family 7.6). Data presented are means of three independent experiments performed
  in triplicate. Error bars indicate SE. Letters denote significant differences at
  the 0.05 level (multiple comparisons).
