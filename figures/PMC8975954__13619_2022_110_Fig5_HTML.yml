caption: ceAF promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation by inhibiting Hippo-YAP signaling
  in AC16 cells. The human cardiomyocyte cell line AC16 was used for initial in vitro
  studies. a Volcano plot of the RNA-seq data of ceAF treated versus the control (DMEM)
  treated AC16 cells (n = 3 per group). b Principal Component Analyses (PCA) of the
  total RNA-seq data (n = 3 per group). c Expression of genes involved in the Hippo
  pathway after 24 h treatment in AC16 strain. d Western blots of YAP, p-YAP S397,
  p-YAP S127, LATS2, and p-LATS2 in AC16 cells treated with DMEM or ceAF (n = 3 per
  group). e-g Quantitative analyses of the immunoblots in (d). h, i Western blots
  (h) and quantitative analyses (i) of intranuclear and cytoplasmic YAP, respectively,
  in AC16 cells treated with DMEM or ceAF (n = 3 per group). j, k Representative images
  and quantitative analyses of immunostaining of anti-YAP (green) and DAPI in AC16
  cells treated with DMEM or ceAF (n = 6 each). Scale bar, 100 μm. l Percent of Ki67
  positive cells over time after ceAF treatment in AC 16 cells with or without siRNA
  silencing of YAP expression. (n = 3 each). *, p < 0.05, **, p < 0.01
