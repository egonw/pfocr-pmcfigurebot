caption: 'Effects of HPS on renal function in diabetic mice. Db/db mice were treated
  with 30 and 60 mg/kg HPS, respectively. Glyburide was used as a positive control
  drug. (A) Body weight measured at day 42. (B) Blood glucose concentration was measured
  on day 42. (C) Serum creatinine level on day 42. (D) UAER on day 42. (E) Urinary
  Î²2-microglobulin levels on day 42. *P<0.01 vs. Control. #P<0.01 vs. db/db. &P<0.01
  vs. HPS 30 mg/kg. ns., not significant; HPS, Hedysarum polybotrys polysacchcaide;
  UAER, urinary albumin excretion rate.'
