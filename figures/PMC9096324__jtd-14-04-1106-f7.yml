caption: 'GSVA analysis of key genes. In order to identify the pathway that shows
  significant variation between samples, the median value of gene expression was used
  as the tangent point, and gene expression levels were placed into two groups based
  on their positions: those with high expression in the high-expression group and
  those with low expression in the low-expression group. This method was used to show
  the molecular mechanism of the core genes that are linked to disease progression.
  GSVA, gene set differentiation analysis.'
