caption: 'Schematic diagram of ImmUniverse data integration strategy. Ulcerative colitis
  and atopic dermatitis will be analyzed separately according to the same principle:
  First, supervised multi-omics analysis will be performed to identify candidate prognostic
  and predictive signatures from multi-omics analysis of single tissue data and evaluate
  their performance in cross-validation (CV) or through publicly available data (as
  available). Signatures will be then correlated between sample matrices to identify
  ‘proxy’ – signatures in matrices suitable for clinical exploitation. Features from
  prediction and correlation tasks will be pooled, mapped to pathways and ontologies
  and prioritized on the basis of their importance for prediction, across-tissue correlation
  and pathway annotation in a collaborative effort between project partners (clinicians,
  biologists and bioinformaticians). Comparison between UC and AD will be done subsequently
  on the basis of shared and specific pathways and ontologies. From these, interaction
  networks and disease maps will be generated to describe the overlapping and unique
  processes in the relevant tissue types. ISF, interstitial fluid.'
