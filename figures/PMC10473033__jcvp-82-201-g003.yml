caption: 'Effect of sRLX on CFs'' viability and proliferation. The cell viability
  in the control group was defined as 100%, whereas that in the other groups was presented
  as the percentage of the control group. A, Cell viability was measured by an MTT
  assay. B, Treated with 50 μL of sRLX at various concentrations (1, 10, 100, and
  200 ng/mL) and different time (24 and 72 hours) by a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay.
  C, Effect of sRLX 100 ng/mL on CFs'' proliferation was detected using the CCK-8
  assay after treatment for 72 hours. The optical density was normalized to a relative
  value of 100% for the control group. Data are represented as the mean ± SD from
  5 independent experiments performed in duplicate after treatment for 72 hours *P
  < 0.05 versus control, #P < 0.05 versus LPS group. &P < 0.05 versus LPS + sRLX group.
