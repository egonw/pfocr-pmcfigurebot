figure_title: 'C-Fos, ARC, EGR-1 expression during exercise: physical exercise triggers
  physiological changes in the body by myokine expression in the muscles. Activation
  of membrane receptors in the brain: the neurotransmitters released bind to specific
  receptors in the brain, including in the hippocampus. This activation causes a cascade
  of intracellular events. Opening signaling pathways: the binding of neurotransmitters
  to their receptors initiates signaling pathways within hippocampal neurons. The
  cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pathway is involved, CaMkII/IV. The cAMP pathway:
  activation of the cAMP pathway triggers a cascade of intracellular reactions, activating
  protein kinase A (PKA). PKA is an enzyme that phosphorylates and activates other
  proteins in gene expression. Once activated, PKA translocates to the nucleus of
  hippocampal neurons, where it phosphorylates and activates transcription factors
  such as CREB. Gene expression: CREB binds to a specific DNA sequence called the
  cAMP response element (CRE) in the promoter region of the target gene. This binding
  initiates a transcription of these genes directly to the start gene (c-Fos, ARC,
  EGR-1). Exercise stimulates neurotransmitter release, activates signaling pathways,
  phosphorylates transcription factors, and leads to c-Fos, ARC, and Egr-1 expression
  in the hippocampus. The activation of this gene indicates increased neural activity,
  synaptic plasticity, and cognitive benefits associated with exercise'
