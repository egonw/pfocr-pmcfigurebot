caption: Inhibiting the CAMK2/CREB pathway reversed MDR in ovarian cancer cells. (A)
  Western blot of p-CAMK2 (T286), CAMK2 (pan), ABCB1, p-CREB1 (s133), CREB1, and BIRC5
  in KN62-treated MDR ovarian cancer cells for 24 h. (B) Rho123 accumulation in MDR
  ovarian cancer cells treated for 6 h with 5 µM KN62. DMSO was used as non-treated
  control. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed t-test (*** p < 0.001).
  (C) Dose-response curves of MDR ovarian cancer cells to doxorubicin (Dox) in the
  presence or absence of 5 µM KN62. (D) Synergistic effects of KN62 and doxorubicin
  (Dox) on MDR ovarian cancer cell killing. The bar graph shows the cell viability
  of MDR ovarian cancer cells treated for 48 h with doxorubicin, KN62, or both. Calculated
  CI values are presented below the plots. (E) Western blot of p-CAMK2 (T286), CAMK2
  (pan), ABCB1, p-CREB1, CREB1, c-PARP, CHOP, and BIRC5 in MDR ovarian cancer cells
  treated for 24 h with 2 µM doxorubicin (Dox), 5 µM terfenadine (Ter), or both. (F)
  Western blot of p-CAMK2 (T286), CAMK2 (pan), ABCB1, p-CREB1, CREB1, c-PARP, CHOP,
  and BIRC5 in MDR ovarian cancer cells treated for 24 h with 2 µM doxorubicin (Dox),
  5 µM KN62, or both. (G) Western blot of ABCB1, p-CREB1 (s133), CREB1, and BIRC5
  in MDR ovarian cancer cells treated for 24 h with 666-15. (H) Rho123 accumulation
  in MDR ovarian cancer cells treated for 6 h with 666-15. DMSO was used as non-treated
  control. Statistical analysis was performed using a one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD
  correction (*** p < 0.001). (I) Synergistic effects of 666-15 and doxorubicin (Dox)
  on MDR ovarian cancer cell killing. The bar graph shows the cell viability of MDR
  ovarian cancer cells treated for 48 h with doxorubicin, 666-15, or both. Calculated
  CI values are presented below the plots.
