caption: 'The loss of sacsin affects the localization of cell adhesion proteins(A)
  Western blot of cell surface protein purification, illustrated by the membrane protein
  ATP1A1, and the nuclear pore protein NUP98. After purification ATP1A1 is detectable
  only in conditions that were treated with biotin, and NUP98 is no longer detected,
  suggesting labeling specificity and enrichment of cell surface proteins.(B) Mass
  spectrometry of cell surface proteins in sacsin KO SH-SY5Y cells. Significance cutoffs:
  p < 0.05 and log2 fold change (f.c.) ±0.4, denoted by black outline. Proteins which
  pass these cutoffs, but were also detected in biotin negative controls, were not
  considered for downstream analysis ().(C) Western blot of NFASC in total lysate
  (left), and fractionated cytoplasmic or membrane fractions in WT and sacsin KO cells.(D)
  Levels of proteins detected in both cell surface and proteomic datasets. Proteins
  are colored by the disparity between these two datasets (f.c. surface and f.c. proteome),
  with red indicating more, and blue less membrane abundance relative to total protein
  levels. Black outlines are proteins with p < 0.05, log2 f.c. ± 0.4 in the surface
  dataset.(E) GO term analysis of proteins differentially localized in membrane of
  sacsin KO cells (p < 0.05, log2 f.c. ±0.4).(F and G) Confocal images for fibronectin
  and vimentin (F) and ER marker KDEL (G) in WT and sacsin KO HEK293 cells. Scale
  bars, 10 μm.(H) Disease enrichment analysis with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of differentially
  localized surface proteins (p < 0.05, log2 f.c. ±0.4).'
