caption: 'Citrus unshiu peel inhibited transcription factors such as c-Fos and c-Jun
  and MAPK. Control: control mice, DSS: distilled water administered to ulcerative
  colitis mice, SASP: sulfasalazine 100 mg/kg body weight administered to ulcerative
  colitis mice, CUPL: CUP 100 mg/kg body weight administered to ulcerative colitis
  mice, and CUPH: CUP 200 mg/kg body weight administered to ulcerative colitis mice.
  Data are mean ± SD (n = 8). Significance: ###p < 0.001 vs. control mice, ∗p < 0.05,
  ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001 vs. DSS mice.'
