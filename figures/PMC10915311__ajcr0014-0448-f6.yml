caption: NTS knockdown in neuron and NTSR1 knockdown in PDAC decreased 3D pancreatic
  cancer motility. Differentiated SH-SY5Y or Neuro-2a was transfected with shLuc or
  shNTS, and 48 h post transfection cells were analyzed with 3D recruitment assay
  together with MIA PaCa-2 (A) and KPC (B), respectively. On the other hand, MIA PaCa-2
  (C) or KPC (D) was transfected with shLuc or shNTSR1, and 48 h post transfection
  cells were analyzed with 3D recruitment assay together with differentiated SH-SY5Y
  and Neuro-2a, respectively. *, P<0.05. Scale bar, 50 Î¼m. Cells with green fluorescence
  in Matrigel are DiO-stained differentiated SH-SY5Y. Cells with red fluorescence
  in medium are Dil-stained MIA PaCa-2.
