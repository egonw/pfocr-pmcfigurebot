caption: Inhibition of AMPK/mTOR signaling decreased M-MDSCs and M1, promoted G-MDSCs
  and M2 under R848 stimulation in vitro Bone marrow cells cultured in a medium supplemented
  with 40 ng/mL IL-6 and 40 ng/mL GM-CSF for 4 days. R848 (100 ng/mL) is used to simulate
  lupus in vitro. INK128 (50 nM), rapamycin (50 nM) and metformin (2 mM) are used
  to block the mTOR signaling pathway. (A) The frequency of MDSCs was determined by
  FACS. (B) The frequency of Macrophages was determined by FACS. (C) The statistical
  results of the frequency of MDSCs. (D) The statistical results of the frequency
  of macrophages. MDSCs represent myeloid-derived suppressor cells. FACS represents
  fluorescent-activated cell sorting. Data represent the mean scores ±SEM. *P ≤ 0.05,
  **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001.
