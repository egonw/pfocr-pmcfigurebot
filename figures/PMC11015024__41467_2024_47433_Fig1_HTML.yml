figure_title: Robust treatment-induced expression changes associated with anti-PD-1
  response in melanoma patients
caption: 'a Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showing the performance
  of using treatment-naïve (gray) or treatment-induced (red) expression to classify
  anti-PD-1 responders and non-responders. The kernel density estimation plot shows
  the distribution of patient response groups on the first principal component of
  treatment-naïve expression (upper) or treatment-induced expression (lower) (n = 42).
  Source Data are provided as Supplementary Data . b Expression correlation between
  419 Resistance signature genes and 366 Sensitivity signature genes in melanoma patients
  (n = 42). Colormap represents the correlation coefficient given by Pearson’s correlation.
  Source Data are provided as Supplementary Data . c Integrating R and S signature
  to classify anti-PD-1 responders and non-responders in training cohort (GSE91061).
  Patients are ranked in descending order based on signature score, which is given
  by the difference of enrichment score between S signature and R signature. Colors
  of the bar indicate the anti-PD-1 response group. Source Data are provided as Supplementary
  Data . d Validation of R and S signature in two independent validation cohorts.

  cohort, n = 17. Source Data are provided as Supplementary Data . f GO Biological
  Process: Pathway enrichment of genes involved in S signature. X-axis represents
  adjusted P value derived from gene set enrichment analysis. The enrichment P value
  is given by the “enrichr” function in GSEA. g GO Biological Process: Pathway enrichment
  of genes involved in R signature. X-axis represents adjusted P value derived from
  gene set enrichment analysis. The enrichment P value is given by the “enrichr” function
