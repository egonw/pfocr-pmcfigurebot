caption: 'BACH1 suppresses MCT1 transcription activity and lactate catabolism. (A)
  Lactate consumption by BM1-shBACH1 and control cells. (B) Representative protein
  blots of BACH1, MCT1, LDHB, and beta-Actin in BM1-shBACH1, MDA-MB-436-shBACH1, and
  4T1.2-shBach1 cells relative to their control (shCont) cells. Band density is indicated
  above the band in Western blots. (C) Diagram showing lactate catabolic pathway.
  (D) Schematic diagram of BACH1 binding regions on the promoter of SLC16A1 and LDHB
  for ChIP assays. (E) Relative fold changes of BACH1, H3K27me3, and IgG on the SLC16A1
  promoter regions using BM1 and MB436 cells. (F) Relative fold changes of BACH1,
  H3K27me3, and IgG on the LDHB promoter regions using BM1 and MB436 cells. (G) Relative
  LDHB activity in control and BM1-shBACH1 cells (#1, #2 shRNA clones). (H) Measurement
  of OCR (left) and ECAR (right) in control and BM1-shBACH1 cells. Mean + s.e.m.,
  n = 3 biologically independent samples. Two-tailed t-test.'
