caption: Regulation of transcription-factor activation through ubiquitination and
  deubiquitination upon T cell stimulation. Overview of known ubiquitin E3 ligases
  (orange) and deubiquitinating enzymes (blue) involved in the regulation of the transcription
  factors NF-κB, NFAT, and JunB/AP1 (green). Details are described in the main text
  of the manuscript. The T cell signaling pathway is indicated by black arrows. Modifications
  that dampen T cell receptor signaling are indicated by red arrows. Ubiquitin modifications
  enhancing T cell signaling are indicated by blue arrows.
