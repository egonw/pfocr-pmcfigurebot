caption: (A,C) Protein expression and mRNA levels of ASF1b were checked in a panel
  of normal gastric cells (GES-1) and five human GC cell lines. (B,D) Protein expression
  and mRNA level of ASF1b were efficiently inhibited by ASF1b-si in AGS and MGC803
  cells. (E,F) Migration assay was performed in AGS and MGC803 cells transfected with
  ASF1b-si/NC (scale bar = 20 Î¼m, **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001).
article_title: ASF1b is a novel prognostic predictor associated with cell cycle signaling
  pathway in gastric cancer.
