caption: STING signaling pathway is activated in KCs in LPS-induced septic mice. (A–B)
  Representative images of immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for STING protein in
  Control and LPS (10 mg/kg for 12 h) group. The AOD value of IHC staining was measured
  by imagePro Plus software (n = 6, 10 + fields per group, bar = 100 μm). (C) Western
  blot analysis of STING protein expression in KCs and hepatocytes isolated from WT
  mice (n = 6). (D–G) Western blot analysis of STING, IRF3, p-IRF3, p65 and p-p65
  protein expression in KCs isolated from WT mice after Control or LPS treatment (n = 6).
  (H–J) The mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines including IFN-β, TNF-α and IL-1β
  in KCs after Control or LPS treatment (n = 6). Data are expressed as mean ± SEM,
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
