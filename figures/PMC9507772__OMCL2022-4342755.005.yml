caption: 'Involvement of the PI3K signaling pathway in miR-372-3p KD-induced angiogenesis
  in HG-stimulated C166 cells. (a) Protein expressions of p-PI3K, PI3K, p-AKT, AKT,
  mTOR, p-mTOR, P70S6K, p-P70S6K, and HIF-1α in the control, model, and miR-372-3p
  KD groups treated with or without LY294002. β-Actin was considered as a loading
  control, and the statistical analysis was performed to present the p-PI3K, PI3K,
  p-AKT, AKT, mTOR, p-mTOR, P70S6K, p-P70S6K, and HIF-1α in the control, model, and
  miR-372-3p KD groups with or without LY294002. (b) Protein expressions of NOX2 and
  NOX4 in the control, model, and miR-372-3p KD groups treated with or without LY294002.
  β-Actin was considered as a loading control, and the statistical analysis was performed
  to present the NOX2 and NOX4 in the control, model, and miR-372-3p KD groups with
  or without LY294002. (c) The number of tubes formed in each group. Data were presented
  as means ± SEM, Bar: 200 μM, n = 4/group, ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01: model group
  vs. miR-372-3p KD group.'
