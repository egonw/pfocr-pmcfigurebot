caption: 'Hepatic HIBCH mRNA expression and plasma 3-HIB concentrations are associated
  with fatty liver. A: Graphical representation of Spearman correlations for hepatic
  HIBCH mRNA and different variables in 66 liver donors with different degrees of
  liver fat content and known NAFLD/NASH status ranging in BMI from 23 to 46 kg/m2
  (Liver cohort). Correlations are significant for p < 0.05 (indicated by red outline
  for the analysis without adjustment for multiple testing). B: Hepatic HIBCH mRNA
  expression in people from the Liver cohort. Participants were stratified into different
  groups based on NAFLD/NASH status, BMI, T2D status and SAT and VAT adiposity. C:
  Graphical representation of Spearman correlations for plasma 3-HIB and different
  variables in 192 participants with abdominal obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) and/or WC ≥
  102 cm (for males) and WC ≥ 88 cm (for females) (CARBFUNC cohort). Liver density
  was measured by CT imaging and calculated as HU units and divided by spleen density.
  Because increased liver density reflects lower fat content, the correlation coefficient
  in the figure was inverted to a positive value (i.e., reflecting more liver fat).
  Abd. SAT, abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue; Clamp GIR, glucose infusion rate
  from euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp; FFA, free fatty acids; HDL-C, high-density
  lipoprotein cholesterol; IL-6, interleukin-6; LDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol;
  SAT, subcutaneous adipose tissue; VAT, visceral adipose tissue; TAG, triacylglycerols;
  WC, waist circumference; WHR; Waist-Hip-Ratio.∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001
