caption: The “three floors” model and scheme of terpenoid biosynthetic pathway. The
  “three floors” model is illustrated using AtGGPPS11. For clarity, a substrate FPP
  (magenta sticks) is modeled into the structure using 3WJN as the reference model.
  The side-chains of residues from the “floors” are shown with sticks and colored
  in green (“first floor”), orange (“second floor”), and red (“third floor”). Dimethylallyl
  pyrophosphate (DMAPP) and isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) from MVA/MEP pathways
  are used as substrates by trans-PTs to generate polyprenyl pyrophosphates with different
  chain lengths which are determined by the “three floors” model. These products from
  trans-PTs are the precursors of terpene synthases (TPSs) and can be further utilized
  to generate various terpenoids including sesquiterpenes (C15), diterpenes (C20),
  sesterterpenes (C25), and polyterpenes (≥C30).
