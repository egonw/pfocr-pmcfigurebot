caption: HOTAIR regulates the stemness of breast cancer cells through NF-κB signaling
  pathway.A, heat map from mRNA real-time PCR data. Thirteen RNA transcripts (p <
  0.05) from MCF7 CSC with HOTAIR overexpression or knockdown were differently expressed
  in the indicated treatments. B, the indicated genes were subjected to the expression
  analysis by real-time PCR. Relative gene expression was normalized to endogenous
  β-actin. Results are shown as means±SD. C, the expression of indicated genes were
  determined by Western blot after HOTAIR overexpression or knockdown. β-actin was
  used as an internal control. D, the expression of indicated genes were determined
  by Western blot after HOTAIR knockdown or PDTC (50 μM) treatment. β-actin was used
  as an internal control. E, the expression of indicated genes were determined by
  Western blot after HOTAIR knockdown or p65 knockdown. β-actin was used as an internal
  control. F, the oncosphere-forming ability was examined under microscope after the
  indicated treatments. Cells were magnified by 200 folds and the scale bar represented
  5 μm. G, c-Myc and Cyclin D1 were determined by Western blot after the indicated
  treatments. β-actin was used as an internal control. H, the oncosphere-forming ability
  was examined under microscope after the indicated treatments. Cells were magnified
  by 200 folds and the scale bar represented 5 μm. CSC, cancer stem cell; HOTAIR,
  Hox transcript antisense intergenic RNA; NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappa B (∗ indicates
  p < 0.05; ∗∗ indicates p < 0.01; ∗∗∗ indicates p < 0.001.).
