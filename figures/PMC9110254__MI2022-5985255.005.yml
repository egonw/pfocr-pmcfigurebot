caption: Effect of glabralactone on the TRIF-dependent TLR signaling pathway. (a)
  Effect of glabralactone on the protein expression of MAPK signaling in LPS-stimulated
  RAW 264.7 cells. Cells were pretreated with glabralactone for 30 min and then stimulated
  with LPS (1 μg/mL) for an additional 30 min. Proteins were analyzed by Western blotting.
  (b) Effect of glabralactone on the protein expression of IRF3 in LPS-stimulated
  RAW 264.7 cells. Cells were pretreated with glabralactone for 30 min and then stimulated
  with LPS (1 μg/mL) for 3 h. After incubation, total proteins were extracted, and
  IRF3 and p-IRF3 protein expressions were analyzed by Western blotting. (c) Effect
  of glabralactone on the mRNA expression of IFN-β in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells.
  Cells were pretreated with glabralactone for 30 min and then stimulated with LPS
  (1 μg/mL) for 4 h. The mRNA expression of IFN-β was analyzed by using reverse transcription
  and real-time PCR. ∗p < 0.05. (d) Effect of glabralactone on the JAK/STAT pathway
  protein expression in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Cells were pretreated with
  glabralactone for 30 min and then stimulated with LPS (1 μg/mL) for 3 h. After incubation,
  total proteins were extracted, and protein level was analyzed by Western blotting.
  (e) Effect of glabralactone on poly (I:C)-induced iNOS expression. RAW 264.7 cells
  were pretreated with glabralactone for 30 min and then stimulated with poly I:C
  (10 μg/mL) for 12 h. After incubation, total proteins were extracted, and iNOS protein
  level was analyzed by Western blotting. β-Actin was used as an internal standard.
  Glabralactone was dissolved in 100% DMSO, and the final concentration of DMSO was
  adjusted to 0.1%.
