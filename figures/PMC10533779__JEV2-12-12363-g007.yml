caption: miR‐146a‐5p increased NOTCH signalling through interaction with and downregulation
  of NUMB expression. (a) Heatmap of significantly differentially expressed mRNA (FDR < 0.05)
  from NHA cells treated with a miR‐146a‐5p mimic for 48 h and compared to a scrambled
  control (miR‐NC). (b) Significantly down‐regulated mRNA results were compared to
  three databases (TargetScan 7.1, miRBD and microT‐CDS) and 18 common genes were
  found as in situ projected binding partners. (c) mRNA‐pulldown assay followed by
  qPCR quantification of bound mRNA‐miR‐146a‐5p complexes from the common 18 binding
  partners. (d) qPCR of NUMB expression in NHA cells after co‐culture with 5.0 × 109
  EVs from melanocytes, NHA or MBM cell lines (H1, H2 and H3), normalized with U6
  expression. (e) WB of Numb protein expression in NHA cells after co‐culture with
  5.0 × 109 EVs from melanocytes, NHA or MBM cell lines (H1, H2 and H3). (f) qPCR
  of NUMB expression in NHA cells after co‐culture with miR‐146a‐5p mimic or a scrambled
  control, normalized to U6 expression. (g) Western blot of Numb protein expression
  in NHA cells after co‐culture with miR‐146a‐5p mimic or a scrambled control. (h)
  Sequence of miR‐146a‐5p 3p binding site, and the comparison of NUMB 3′UTR‐wild type
  (WT) and mutated (MUT) region. (i) Dual luciferase assay on the WT or MUT 3′UTR
  region with miR‐146a‐5p or a scrambled control in NHA cells, represented as the
  relative firefly to Renilla luciferase activity. (j) ELISA of top four upregulated
  cytokines released by NHA cells with WT or overexpression of NUMB in the presence
  of miR‐146a‐5p mimic or control. n.s.= not significant, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001,
  ****p < 0.0001.
