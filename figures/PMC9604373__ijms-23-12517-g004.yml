caption: Progestins changed cell migration and invasive abilities in THRB- or THRA-knockdown
  EC cells. (A,B) RL95-2 or (C,D) KLE cells were pretreated with si-THRA or si-THRB
  for 48 h and then incubated in a polycarbonate filter insert containing DMSO, 30
  uM MPA, or NOMAc for 12 h to examine the cell migration (A,C) and invasion (B,D).
  The results are presented as mean ± SEM of three independent culture experiments.
  si-Ctrl, negative control treated with siRNA solvent; si-THRA, silenced THRA; si-THRB,
  silenced THRB.
