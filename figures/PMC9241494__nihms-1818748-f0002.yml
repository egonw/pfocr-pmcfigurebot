caption: 'PD subjects were divided into treatment naïve and treated and were compared
  to population controls. pC = population (non-spousal, non-household) control, nPD
  = treatment naïve PD subjects, tPD = treated PD subjects. One-way ANOVA (p value)
  followed by multiple comparison correction (q value), post hoc Tukey values shown
  on graph: **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.'
