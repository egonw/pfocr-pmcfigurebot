caption: 'Inflammatory cytokine and metabolomic profiling. (A) Heatmaps for the differential
  cytokines related to sarcopenia and tumor recurrence, respectively (R package: ggplot2);
  (B) The Venn Diagrams for the cytokines/metabolites related to sarcopenia and tumor
  recurrence concurrently; (C) The protein interaction mapping for the 6 cytokines
  that were concurrently related to sarcopenia and tumor recurrence; (D) The heatmap
  for the metabolites that were concurrently related to sarcopenia and tumor recurrence
  (R package: ggplot2); (E) Pathway analysis for the identified metabolites that were
  concurrently related to sarcopenia and tumor recurrence (MBROLE 2.0); (F) and (G)
  The co-expression network of the metabolites belonging to sterol metabolism and
  fatty acid metabolism. Gray hexagon and green border indicate decreased level in
  sarcopenic patients and recurrent patients, respectively. Red hexagon and orange
  border indicate increased level in sarcopenic patients and recurrent patients, respectively.
