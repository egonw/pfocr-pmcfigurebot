caption: Autonomous synthesis with a DNA walker. (a) A DNA walker with “robotic arms”
  is capable of picking up different gold nanoparticles when traversing a programmed
  track with cargo-donating stations. AFM images show the change in nanoparticle arrangement
  at specific stages of the walker. Reproduced with permission from ref (). Copyright

  synthesis programmed by a molecular walker. A DNAzyme-based walker modified with
  a primary amine is able to react with succinimidyl ester functionalized footholds
  to yield complex molecules. Reproduced with permission from ref (). Copyright 2010,

  system on DNA origami. Reproduced from ref (). Copyright 2018, American Chemical
