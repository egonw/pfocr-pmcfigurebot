caption: 'Effects of Zn2+ on ATP13A2, α-synuclein, and autophagy–lysosome pathway
  in HEK293 α-synuclein-DsRed cells. (a) Cell viability of HEK293 α-synuclein-DsRed
  cells incubated with different concentrations of Zn2+ for 12 and 24 h. All values
  are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) of at least three independent
  experiments. (b) TSQ staining was used to verify the zinc fluorescence intensity
  in HEK293 α-synuclein-DsRed cells with a medium containing 10 or 75 μM ZnSO4. Bar
  = 25 μm. (c) HEK293 α-synuclein-DsRed cells were untreated or treated with 75 μM
  ZnSO4 for 12 h. Cells were observed using confocal microscopy after staining with
  ATP13A2 and DAPI. The spontaneous red fluorescence of HEK293 α-synuclein-DsRed cells
  represented the expression levels of α-synuclein. Scale bar = 25 μm. (d–m) HEK293
  α-synuclein-DsRed cells were treated with 10 or 75 μM ZnSO4 for 12 h. Immunoblot
  images ((d,f), left panels) and quantification ((e,g,h), right panels) show the
  expression of ATP13A2 (d), p-α-synuclein and α-synuclein (f) in the HEK293 α-synuclein-DsRed
  cells. Autophagy–lysosome pathway ((i), representative pictures; (j–m) quantification):
  the expression levels of LAMP-1 (i,j), LAMP-2a (i,k), P62 (i,l), LC3 I and LC3 II
  ((i,m), quantification of ratio of LC3II to LC3I) were determined using Western
  blot analysis with β-actin as an internal control. All data from at least three
  independent experiments are represented as the means ± SEM. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01
  with respect to the control group.'
