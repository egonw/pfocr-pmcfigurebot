caption: 'Immunohistochemical analysis of the TGF-β1RI, TGF-β1RII, and pSMAD-2 proteins
  in heart tissue sections of control and drug-treated male Npr1 gene knockout mice:
  representative immunohistochemistry of TGF-β1RI and TGF-β1RII (panels (A,B)). Quantitative
  analysis of protein immunoreactivity in heart tissues (panels (C,D)). Representative
  immunohistochemistry of pSMAD-2 protein immunoreactivity in heart tissues (panel
  (E)). Quantitative analysis of densitometry of pSAMD-2 (panel (F)). Values are expressed
  as means ± S.E. (n = 6 animals in each group). Statistical significance is expressed
  as ### p < 0.001, vehicle-treated 0-copy and 1-copy vs. 2-copy; * p < 0.05, ** p
  < 0.01, vehicle-treated 0-copy,1-copy and 2 copy vs. drug-treated same gene copy
  number.'
