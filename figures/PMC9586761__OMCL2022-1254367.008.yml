caption: 'GNAI2 activates the PI3K/AKT pathway in GC cells. MK2206 counteracted the
  effect of GNAI2 on invasion and proliferation of gastric cancer cells. Comparison
  of HGC27 cells transfected with blank plasmid vs. HGC27 cells transfected with GNAI2
  plasmid. Compared with the negative control Hs-746T cells, 740Y-P enhanced the effects
  of GNAI2 on proliferation and invasion of gastric cancer cells in Hs-746T cells
  transfected with a GNAI2-silencing plasmid. (a) Enhanced invasive ability of cells
  detected by a cell invasion assay in HGC27 cells. (b) Images of cell cycles after
  transfection with GNAI2 lentivirus were assessed by flow cytometry in HGC27 cells.
  (c) Proliferation of GC cells after transfection with GNAI2 lentivirus was assessed
  by CCK-8 assay in HGC27 cells. (d) Protein expression after transfection with GNAI2
  lentivirus as assessed by western blotting in HGC27cells. (e) Data represent mean
  ± SD of relative protein expression of genes in each group. GAPDH was used as an
  internal control. (f) Inhibited invasive ability of cells detected by a cell invasion
  assay in Hs-746T cells. (g) Images of cell cycles after transfection with a GNAI2-silencing
  plasmid as assessed by flow cytometry in Hs-746T cells. (h) Proliferation of GC
  cells after transfection with a GNAI2-silencing plasmid as assessed by CCK-8 assay
  in Hs-746T cells. (i) Protein expression after transfection with a GNAI2-silencing
  plasmid was assessed by western blotting in Hs-746T cells. (j) Data represent mean
  ± SD of relative protein expression of genes in each group. GAPDH was used as an
  internal control. Cell line: (a, b, c, d, e) HGC27+Vector, HGC27+GNAI2oE, HGC27+Vector+MK2206,
  and HGC27+GNAI2oE+MK2206. Vector, blank transfection vector: (f, g, h, i, j) Hs-746T+NC,
  Hs-746T+GNAI2Sh1, Hs-746T+NC+740Y-P, and Hs-746T+GNAI2Sh1+740Y-P. NC: negative control
  group; Sh1: GNAI2-silencing transfection vector; ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01; ∗∗∗P < 0.008.'
