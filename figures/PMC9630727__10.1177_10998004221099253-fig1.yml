caption: The HPA axis stress response mechanism. During active stress, the HPA axis
  is triggered when stress input is received by the hypothalamus from the amygdala
  and the limbic system. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is secreted into the
  circulation from the periventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. Arginine
  vasopressin (AVP) is also expressed in the PVN and subsequently potentiates the
  effects of CRH in stimulating the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
  from the anterior pituitary gland. Circulating ACTH binds to receptors in the adrenal
  cortex leading to the secretion of GCs (cortisol in humans) into the circulation.
  GC binds with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the anterior pituitary signaling
  the start of the negative feedback mechanism.
