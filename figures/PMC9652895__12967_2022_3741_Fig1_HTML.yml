caption: Celastrol inhibited the viability, migration, and invasion of NSCLC Cells.
  A Chemical structure of celastrol. B IC50 values of celastrol in NSCLC cells. Three
  NSCLC cell lines were placed in a 96-well plate with various concentrations of celastrol
  (0–100 μmol) After 48 h, treatment with celastrol, MTT assay was employed to determine
  the proliferation ability of cells. GraphPad Prism 7.0 software was used to acquire
  proliferation curves. C Representative images of colony formation assay. After incubation
  with the indicated dose of celastrol for 12 h, colonies of four cell lines were
  recorded after about 7 days. D PC-9 cells were treated with celastrol (0, 1, 2,
  and 4 μM) and allowed to migrate into the scratched area. E Celastrol induced loss
  of invasion potential in NSCLC cells. Triple assays were repeated. (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001)
