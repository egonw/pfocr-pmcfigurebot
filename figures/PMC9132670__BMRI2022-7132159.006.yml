caption: BRU inhibits the tumorous growth and metastasis in nude mice. Representative
  image of nude mouse tumor in subcutaneous tumor-forming model of the control group
  (normal saline) and BRU (2 mg/kg) group (a). Changes in body weight of mice in the
  control group and BRU group during treatment (b). Representative image of HE staining
  in tumor tissue (c). Changes in tumor volume and weight were compared between the
  control group and the BRU group during treatment (d, f). The protein levels of RhoA,
  ROCK1, E-cadherin, Vimentin, N-cadherin, MMP2, and MMP9 in tumor tissues were analyzed
  by western blotting (g, h). Body weight changes of the control group and BRU group
  in the nude mouse model after tail vein injection (h). Metastatic nodules in lung
  and bowel (i, j). All data were shown as mean ± SD from three independent trials
  (∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. control).
