caption: Heatmap of top 50 differentially expressed genes in GSE54129. Genes are categorized
  into different clusters, based on the expression level. Samples also are categorized
  into two main clusters based on group (control or tumor). The first 21 columns in
  the left side of heatmap represent normal samples and other 111 columns in the right
  side of heatmap are showing the tumor samples.
