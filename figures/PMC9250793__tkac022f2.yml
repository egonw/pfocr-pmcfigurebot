caption: Mechanism of transforming growth factor-β/bone morphogenetic protein (TGF-β/BMP)
  signaling pathway. The TGF-β/BMP ligand binds to the receptor to form a binary complex,
  while the type II receptor activates the type I receptor, which further phosphorylates
  the R-Smad protein so that it can bind to Co-Smad4, enter the nucleus and activate
  a series of downstream target genes
