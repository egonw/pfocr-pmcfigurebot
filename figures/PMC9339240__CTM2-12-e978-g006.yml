caption: 'STAT1‐IFIT5 signalling activation emerges during the advanced progression
  of PCa toward CRPC and NEPC. (A) Heat map illustrating the gene expression profile
  among three ARCaP sublines‐IIB5, IIF11 and Fast. (B) The ingenuity pathway analysis
  of significant enrichment of IFN signalling pathway genes in ARCaP‐IIF11, compared
  to ARCaP‐Fast and ‐IIB5 sublines. (C,D) GSEA identifying enrichment of genes associated
  with IFNα and IFNγ response in IIF11 subline, compared to Fast and IIB5 sublines.
  (E) Upper: expression of STAT1, AR, RB1 and TP53 protein levels among screened PCa
  lines including ARCaP sublines. Lower: screening of BRN2, SOX2, SYP and CgA mRNA
  levels among PCa lines including ARCaP sublines. (F) Expression level of 10 IFN‐inducible
  STAT1‐driven genes among PCa lines including ARCaP sublines. (G) Expression of ten
  IFN‐inducible STAT1‐driven genes in ARCaP‐IIF11 subline treated with fludarabine
  (1 μM) or ruxolitinib (2.5 μM) for 48 h. (H) Left: expression of ten IFN‐inducible
  STAT1‐driven genes in ARCaP‐Fast bone metastatic subline, compared to parental line.
  Right: in vitro invasion assay examining the invasiveness of ARCaP‐Fast bone metastatic
  line. (I) The impact of fludarabine (20 mg/kg) or ruxolitinib (20 mg/kg) on the
  sub‐cutaneous ARCaP‐IIF11 tumour growth, compared to vehicle control. (ns = no significant
  differences, *p < .05, **p < .001, ***p < .0001)'
