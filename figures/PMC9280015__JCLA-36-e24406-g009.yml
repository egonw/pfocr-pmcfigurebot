caption: LINC00941 promoted glycolysis in laryngocarcinoma cells. (A–D) The glucose
  consumption and lactate production of SNU‐46 and SNU‐899 cells transfected with
  shLINC00941 vector or LINC00941 overexpression vector were assessed by the colorimetric
  method. (E–L) The expressions of HK2, PFKFB3, PFKFB4 and PKM in SNU‐46 and SNU‐899
  cells transfected with shLINC00941 vector or LINC00941 overexpression vector were
  measured by RT‐qPCR assay. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; * vs. Empty vector
  (HK2, hexokinase 2; PFKFB3, 6‐phosphofructo‐2‐kinase/fructose‐2,6‐biphosphatase
  3, PFKFB4, 6‐phosphofructo‐2‐kinase/fructose‐2,6‐biphosphatase 4; PKM, pyruvate
  kinase M; RT‐qPCR, real time‐quantitative polymerase chain reaction; shLINC00941,
  short hairpin RNA vector for LINC00941)
