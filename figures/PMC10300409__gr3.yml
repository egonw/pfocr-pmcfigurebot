caption: Virotherapy by the recombinant strains in vivo(A) Subcutaneous CT26 colon
  carcinoma and 4T1 breast tumor progression in control treated with PBS and experimental
  groups treated with LIVP-RFP, LIVP-IL15-RFP, LIVP-IL15Rα-RFP, and a combination
  of LIVP-IL15-RFP+ LIVP-IL15Rα. ✝ represents the sacrifice of the animal. (B) The
  overall survival rate of BALB/c mice bearing CT26 colon carcinoma and 4T1 breast
  tumors treated by the recombinant viruses and the control group based on the Kaplan-Meier
  method. For statistical analysis, ANOVA and survival analysis were performed; ∗p < 0.05,
  ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001 indicate significance.
