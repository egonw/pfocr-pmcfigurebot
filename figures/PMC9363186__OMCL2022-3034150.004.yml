caption: RACGAP1 promoted proliferation and metastasis of HCC through PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathway. (a) The underlying pathways of RACGAP1 participation analyzed by GSEA (Gene
  Set Enrichment Analysis). (b) The proliferation markers (CDK2 and CCNB1) and key
  genes (PIK3CA and AKT1) in PI3K/AKT signaling pathway showed high correlation with
  RACGAP1 in TCGA-LIHC. (c) The nuclear β-catenin (nu-β-catenin), p-GSK3β and p-AKT
  were obviously diminished in Huh7 and HCCLM3 with si-RACGAP1, while increased in
  SMMC7721 with overexpression of RACGAP1. (d) RACGAP1 overexpression promoted β-catenin
  nuclear translocation by immunofluorescence. (e) The protein levels of proliferation
  markers (CDK2 and Cyclin D1), EMT markers (E-ca, Claudin-1 and Vimentin) and MMPs
  (MMP2 and MMP9) in HCC cell lines with RACGAP1 knockdown and overexpression. (f)
  RACGAP1 knockdown suppressed CDK2 expression in Huh7 and HCCLM3 cell lines.
