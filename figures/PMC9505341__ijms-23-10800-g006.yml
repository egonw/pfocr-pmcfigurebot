caption: CRF-R1 signaling pathway in NAc of juvenile rats. Measurement of NAc extracellular
  neurotransmitter levels using in vivo microdialysis, the vertical gray bar indicates
  the time of NAc local infusion of 70 mM K+-aCSF, and the horizontal black lines
  indicate the time of intra-NAc infusion of the antagonist, vehicle, or co-infusion
  of antagonist with Forskolin. (A) NAc DA levels in the presence of aCSF (blue; n
  = 5), 10 µM of CP154,526 (orange; n = 6), and 10 µM of CP154,526 + 50 µM of Forskolin
  (green; n = 5). DA levels were normalized to the average of the first 3 values for
  each condition and expressed as percentage. Two-way ANOVA revealed no effect of
  treatment (F (2, 13) = 1.279, p = 0.3110), a main effect of time (F (9, 117) = 25.19,
  p < 0.0001), and treatment × time interaction (F (18, 117) = 1.914, p = 0.0209;
  CP154,526 vs. aCSF, **** p< 0.0001, CP154,526 + Forskolin vs. aCSF, **** p< 0.0001,
  Bonferroni post hoc test). (B) NAc glutamate levels in the presence of aCSF (blue;
  n = 5), 10 µM of CP154,526 (orange; n = 6) and 10 µM of CP154,526 + 50 µM of Forskolin
  (green; n = 6). Glutamate levels were normalized to the average of the first 3 values
  for each condition and expressed as percentage. Two-way ANOVA revealed no effect
  of treatment (F (2, 14) = 2.756, p = 0.0979), a main effect of time (F (9, 126)
  = 12.04, p < 0.0001), and treatment × time interaction (F (18, 126) = 2.207, p =
  0.0058; CP154,526 vs. aCSF, ** p= 0.0098, **** p< 0.0001, CP154,526 + Forskolin
  vs. aCSF, ** p= 0.0079, Bonferroni post hoc test). (C) NAc GABA levels in the presence
  of aCSF (blue; n = 5), 10 µM of CP154,526 (orange; n = 6) and 10 µM of CP154,526
  + 50 µM of Forskolin (green; n = 6). GABA levels were normalized to the average
  of the first 3 values for each condition and expressed as percentage. Two-way ANOVA
  revealed no effect of treatment (F (2, 14) = 0.1510, p = 0.8612), a main effect
  of time (F (9, 126) = 34.07, p < 0.0001), and no treatment × time interaction (F
  (18, 126) = 0.3438, p = 0.9942; CP154,526 vs. aCSF, n.s. p > 0.9999, CP154,526 +
  Forskolin vs. aCSF, n.s. p > 0.9999, Bonferroni post hoc test).
