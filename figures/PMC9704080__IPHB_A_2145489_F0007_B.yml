caption: Western blotting for key proteins involved in the PI3K/AkT/mTOR signalling
  pathway in HA22T and HepG2 cells treated with 13-acetoxysarcocrassolide. After HA22T
  and HepG2 cells were treated with different concentrations of 13-acetoxysarcocrasside
  (1, 2, and 4 µM), the expression of AKT, p-AKT, PI3K, p-PI3K, mTOR, p-mTOR, p70S6K,
  p-p70S6K, p-4EBP1, p-S6, p-eIF4E, and p-eIF4B proteins was analysed. β-Actin served
  as a loading control.

  carcinoma cells through mitochondrial dysfunction and suppression of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/p70S6K
  signalling pathway.
