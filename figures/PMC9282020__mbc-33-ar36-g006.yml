caption: The combination of MetR and Rapa increases utilization of alternative carbon
  sources following inhibition of specific metabolic pathways. Metabolic flexibility,
  defined as the ability to maintain oxygen consumption following treatment with metabolic
  pathway pharmacological inhibitor(s), was tested under conditions of Rapa and Rapa
  plus MetR at 1 mg/l. Panels (A) and (B) contain the results of a comparison of Rapa-treated
  cultures and cultures treated with the combination of MetR and Rapa. Panels (C)
  and (D) contain the results of a comparison of methionine-restricted cultures and
  cultures treated with the combination of MetR and Rapa. Pyruvate oxidation was determined
  following the addition of UK5099 (inhibitor of mitochondrial pyruvate transporter),
  while the capacity for pyruvate oxidation was determined following sequential treatment
  of the glutaminase inhibitor BPTES (10 μM) and Etomoxir (15 μM) followed by UK5099.
  Glutamine/palmitate oxidation was determined following treatment with BPTES/Etomoxir
  (left panels in [A] and [C]), while the capacity for glutamine/palmitate oxidation
  was determined following sequential treatment of UK5099, and the combination of
  BPTES and Etomoxir (right panels in [A] and [C]). The measurement of spare capacity
  was based on the difference between capacity and the rate of oxidation for pyruvate
  oxidation (left panels in [B] and [D]) and glutamine/fatty acid oxidation (right
  panels in [B] and [D]). OCR and ECAR were normalized to cell number by counting
  cells in each well at the completion of the assay using flow cytometry. Asterisks
  represent values that are significantly (P < 0.05) different versus control. Significance
  is based on unpaired, two-tailed, Student’s T test. Results are representative of
  two independent experiments.
