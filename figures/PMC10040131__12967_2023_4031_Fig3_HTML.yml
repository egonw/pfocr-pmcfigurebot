caption: PHF6 recruits BPTF to activate HIF target genes in breast cancer cells. A
  The ChIP-qPCR assay was conducted with PHF6 antibody in parental and HIF-DKO MCF-7
  cells which were exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 24 h. B The ChIP-qPCR assay was conducted
  with HIF-1α antibody in control and doxycycline (DOX)-inducible PHF6 knockdown cells
  which were exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 24 h. PHF6 proteins were shown by western
  blotting assay in the indicated groups. C The Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay
  showing the endogeous interactions between PHF6 and NURF subunits (BPTF, SNF2L,
  RBBP4). D The ChIP-qPCR assays using BPTF antiboy or IgG control in WT and PHF6-KO
  MCF-7 cells that were exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 24 h. E The HIF luciferase reporter
  activity was detected in MCF-7 cells derived from the indicated groups that were
  cultured in 20% or 1% O2 for 24 h. F The RT-qPCR analysis of mRNAs of HIF targets
  and non-HIF target UBLCP1 in shCtrl and shBPTF MCF-7 cells that were exposed to
  20% or 1% O2 for 24 h. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001
