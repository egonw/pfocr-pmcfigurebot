figure_title: Knockdown of LRP3 upregulates the expression of SDC4 by activating the
  Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway in chondrocytes
caption: a RNA-seq comparison revealed a total of 5930 genes expressed, of which 3116
  genes were upregulated and 2787 genes were downregulated. b The volcano plot illustrating
  differential genes from RNA-seq analysis. c Heatmap of mRNA-seq analysis in rat
  chondrocytes treated with Lv-con 313 or Lv-siLrp3. d Representative images of LRP3
  IHC staining of knee joints from WT and LRP3−/− mice subjected to Sham or ACLT operation
  (n = 5, one-way ANOVA). e Representative images of LRP3 IHC staining of knee joints
  from vehicle or Lv-siLrp3 injected rats subjected to Sham or ACLT operation (n = 5,
  one-way ANOVA). f Representative images of LRP3 IHC staining of knee joints from
  Sham, Vehicle, and Lv-Lrp3 treatment rats (n = 5, one-way ANOVA). g Quantification
  of LRP3 and SDC4 mRNA (n = 4, two-tailed Student’s t-test) and proteins levels (n = 3)
  in rat chondrocytes treated with Lv-con313 or Lv-siLrp3. h Quantification of LRP3
  and SDC4 mRNA (n = 4, two-tailed Student’s t-test) and proteins levels (n = 3) in
  TNF-α (20 ng/ml)-induced rat OA chondrocytes treated with Lv-con335 or Lv-Lrp3 (n = 5).
  i KEGG pathway analysis of upregulated targets in LRP3-knockdown transcriptome.
  j Western blot analysis of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway and SDC4 in rat
  chondrocytes treated with Lv-con313, Lv-siLrp3, and/or Salirasib (n = 3). k Western
  blot analysis of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway and SDC4 in TNF-α (20 ng/ml)-induced
  rat OA chondrocytes treated with Lv-con335 or Lv-Lrp3 (n = 3). Data are shown as
  the mean ± SD. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. n indicates the number of biologically
  independent samples or mice per group.
