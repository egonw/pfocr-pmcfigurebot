caption: Modes of Hedgehog pathway activity in cancers. (A) Canonical ligand-independent
  activation occurs when mutations in pathway components, e.g., PTCH1 or SMO, cause
  aberrant activation of the pathway in cancer cells. (B) Tumor-suppressive activity
  of ligand-dependent canonical Hh signaling pathway occurs when Hh ligands produced
  by tumor cells activate the pathway in neighboring fibroblasts that, in turn, secrete
  factors, such as BMPs, back to the tumor to inhibit tumor cell growth. (C) Noncanonical
  oncogenic activation of GLI1 and GLI2 transcription factors in tumor cells does
  not rely on SMO activation. Rather, it arises from the crosstalk between other signaling
  pathways and GLI1 and GLI2 within the tumor cell, resulting in the activation of
  GLI1 and GLI2 and the transcription of Hh pathway target genes. Created with BioRender.com.
