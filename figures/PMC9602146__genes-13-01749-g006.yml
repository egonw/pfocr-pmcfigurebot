caption: Interaction network diagram of flowering regulatory proteins in the sugar
  pathway. The darkness of the lines is proportional to the combined_score (between
  0 and 1, where the higher the value, the greater the reliability of the predicted
  interaction between the two proteins). The node size increases with the number of
  interacting proteins. Red circles are proteins that are members of the A. pumila
  sugar pathway; green circles are interacting with A. thaliana proteins.
