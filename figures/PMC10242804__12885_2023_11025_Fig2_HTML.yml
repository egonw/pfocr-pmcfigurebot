caption: Cell clone and EDU experiments showing the proliferation capability of A172
  and U251 cells infected by different viruses. (A, B) Cell clone experiment. The
  colony formation capability of A172 and U251 cells is increased by AQP8 overexpression
  (O.E) and decreased by AQP8 knockdown (K.D) compared with the control group. (C,
  D) Bar graphs of colony formation of A172 and U251 cells. Complete proliferation
  analysis was performed by observing the number of cell clones (vs. control, *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01). (E, F) EDU fluorescence staining experiment. Red represents EDU, and
  blue represents nucleus. Fluorescence intensity in A172 and U251 cells is increased
  by AQP8 overexpression and decreased by AQP8 knockdown. (G, H) EDU percentage and
  analysis in A172 and U251 cells of different groups (vs. control, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01).
  EDU, 5-ethyl-2-deoxyuridine; AQP, aquaporin; NC, negative control; O.E, AQP8-overexpressed;
  K.D, AQP8-knockdown; DAPI, 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole. All experiments were performed
  in triplicate
