caption: RPPA data reveal high inter-metastatic heterogeneity in WNT- and EGFR-related
  proteins, but clearly separate CRLM from normal liver. (A,B) Normal liver samples
  (green) and CRLM from both patients (purple) were characterized by RPPA for the
  expression of total proteins (A) and phosphorylated proteins (B) associated with
  either the WNT or the EGFR signaling pathway. Protein levels were normalized to
  the median of the normal tissue samples.
