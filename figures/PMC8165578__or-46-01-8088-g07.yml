caption: Phlorizin inhibits the activation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. (A)
  The expression level of the proteins involved in the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway
  in the KYSE450 cells, following treatment with phlorizin for 48 h, was analyzed
  using western blot analysis and the results were (B and C) statistically analyzed
  using densitometry. (D) The expression level of the proteins involved in the JAK2/STAT3
  signaling pathway in the KYSE450 cells, following treatment with phlorizin for 48
  h, was analyzed using western blot analysis and the results were (E and F) statistically
  analyzed using densitometry. The results are presented as the mean Â± SEM. *P<0.05,
  **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001. p, phosphorylated; NS, not significant.
