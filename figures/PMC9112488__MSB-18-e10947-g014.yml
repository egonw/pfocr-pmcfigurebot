figure_title: Kupffer cell‐enriched proteins in antigen processing and presentation
  pathway
caption: Clustering of proteins significantly differentially abundant across the four
  cell types that are related to the immune response and protein degradation. Values
  are presented as mean protein abundance followed by Z‐score normalization across
  cell types (n = 3 independent biological replicates for each cell type).
