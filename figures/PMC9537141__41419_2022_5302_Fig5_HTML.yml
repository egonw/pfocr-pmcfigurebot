figure_title: PDI interacts with GRP78, leads to ERS, and activates AKT/mTOR signaling
  pathway
caption: A–D Immunoblot analysis showing the levels of ERS pathway-related proteins
  GRP78, PERK, ATF6 (A, C) or AKT/mTOR pathway-related proteins (B, D) in PDI knockdown
  or overexpression HCT116 or MEF cells treated with γ-ray (4 Gy) or cisplatin (20 μM)
  irradiation for 24 h. E, F Immunoblot analysis showing the levels of ERS pathway-related
  proteins and AKT/mTOR pathway-related proteins in PDI knockdown or overexpression
  MEF cells treated with γ-ray irradiation (E) or cisplatin (F) for 24 h. G, H The
  existence of PDI in the co-precipitated complexes was confirmed by western blotting,
  IgG was employed as the negative control. Western blotting shows the association
  of PDI with GRP78 after Co-IP in HCT116 cells were treated with γ-ray (4 Gy) irradiation
  (G) or cisplatin (20 μM) (H) for 24 h. I, J The existence of PDI in the co-precipitated
  complexes was confirmed by western blotting, IgG was employed as the negative control.
  Western blotting shows the association of PDI with GRP78 after Co-IP in MEF cells
  were treated with γ-ray (4 Gy) irradiation (I) or cisplatin (20 μM) (J) for 24 h.
  K, L HCT116 cells were pretreated with or without 5 mM MK2206 (K) or 10 µM 4-PBA
  (L) for 2 h, then irradiated with 4 Gy γ-ray for 24 h. LC3II accumulation was measured
  using western blotting.
