caption: Effect of GXP on the expression of NF-κB. GXP inhibited the activation of
  ET-1 on NF-κB signaling pathway. The graphs represent the level of NF-κB for three
  independent experiments. (a) The protein expression levels of NF-κB. (A) Comparison
  of NF-κB, GAPDH, and H3 protein expression in nucleus and cytoplasm. (B) The band
  of NF-κB protein in Western blotting; (b) immunofluorescence staining was performed
  to determine the expression and distribution of NF-κB, 400x. The expression of NF-κB
  was red, and nuclei were stained blue with DAPI. The micrographs are representative
  of three independent experiments; (c) (C, D) the relative expression of NF-κB protein
  in physiological and pathological groups. (E, F) The ratio of NF-κB fluorescence
  intensity in physiological and pathological groups. In the physiological group,
  other groups were compared with the control group, and in the pathological group,
  other groups were compared with the model group (ET-1 group), ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01
  compared with the model group (ET-1 group).
