caption: Transcriptome sequencing and genome occupancy analysis in E12.5 WT and Eed
  cKO forebrain(A) Volcano plot shows 420 down-regulated genes (green) and 254 up-regulated
  genes (orange) in E12.5 Eed cKO forebrains. WT, n = 2; Eed cKO, n = 3.(B, C) Bar
  charts depicting the top GO terms (p-adjust < 0.05) of down-regulated genes and
  up-regulated genes in E12.5 Eed cKO forebrains.(D) The KEGG pathway analysis of
  differential expression genes in E12.5 Eed cKO forebrains.(E) Heatmaps show dysregulated
  genes were enriched in the cAMP signaling, Hippo signaling, and Hedgehog signaling
  pathways.(F) Pie chart illustrating the distribution of EED binding sites in the
  genome at E12.5.(G) Sequence logos corresponding to top enriched motifs within EED-binding
  sites identified by de novo motif analysis.(H) Statistical integration analysis
  of dysregulated genes in E12.5 Eed cKO forebrains predicted a dual function of EED
  as an al repressor (blue line) and an activator (red line), using a reference set
  of non-differentially expressed genes (dashed black line) for normalization. The
  p values for each function were indicated in the chart.(I) Top predicted al targets
  of EED in E12.5 forebrains.(J) Bar plots showing the top GO terms (p-adjust < 0.05)
  of top 200 up-regulated and 200 down-regulated targets of EED.
