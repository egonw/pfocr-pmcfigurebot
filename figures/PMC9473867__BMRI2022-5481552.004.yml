caption: 'Hirudin works out an inhibitory effect on both the overall phosphorylation
  of PDGFRβ and the downstream AKT pathway. (a) Western blot detection on the expressions
  of PDGFB, PDGFRβ, p-PDGFRβ, PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT, and p-AKT. (b) Semiquantitative analysis
  was performed based on the gray value. GAPDH was used for the endogenous protein.
  ##compared with the Model, P < 0.01.'
