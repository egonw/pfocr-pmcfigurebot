caption: Hypothetical mechanism of an adaptive fear response; amended from Jones,
  ‘The assessment of fear in the domestic fowl’ []. Solid lines represent the initial
  stage, broken lines the second stage and dotted lines the third stage. Yellow represents
  factors that are thought to influence the subjective state of fear, green events
  are in direct response to the stimulus, light blue represents physiological events
  and dark blue represents the behavioural decision-making tree. Red lines indicate
  the negative feedback that reduces fear following the appropriate response. Factors
  and events outlined in black were assessed in this paper. Context includes methodological
  factors such as testing individually versus in pairs/groups or testing in the home
  pen versus a testing arena. Other systems influencing the fear response could be
  reproduction (e.g. protection of young) or foraging (e.g. risk-taking versus food
  abundance). We propose that genetic effects could be at the level of perception,
  innate fears, unconscious reflex, physiological response (neuroendocrine activation)
  and type of behavioural response. Behavioural responses can indicate levels of experienced
  fear, with ‘investigation’ and potentially ‘immobility’ indicating low levels of
  fearfulness, while ‘fight’, ‘flight’ and ‘freezing’ indicate high levels of fearfulness.
  ‘Fight’ and ‘flight’ are active fear behaviours, and ‘freezing’ is an inactive fear
  behaviour. SAM stands for the sympathomedullary pathway. HPA stands for the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal
  axis.
