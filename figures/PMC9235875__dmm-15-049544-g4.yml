caption: Snrpbncc+/− mutant heads show aberrant splicing including increased exon
  skipping and intron retention. (A) Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified
  in Snrpbncc+/− (Het) mutants could be grouped into molecular pathways belonging
  to the P53 signaling pathway and the spliceosome. (B) A much larger number of transcripts
  was found to be abnormally spliced in Snrpbncc+/− mutants compared to controls (Snrpbwt).
  The most abundant differentially spliced events (DSEs) were skipped exons (SEs)
  and retained introns (RIs). A strong tendency towards increased exon skipping and
  intron inclusion in the mutant samples was observed; there were more SEs (273 in
  Het versus 83 in WT) and RIs (191 in Het versus 21 in WT). DSEs were predicted to
  introduce premature termination codons (PTCs) more often in Hets compared to WT.
  (C-F) In Hets, exon skipping was significantly higher for non-constitutive exons
  (NonCE) when constitutive (CE) versus (NonCE) was examined (unpaired, two-tailed
  t-test). (G-J) An analysis of splice site (SS) strengths in DSEs revealed significantly
  stronger 5′ SS in mutants than in controls (P=0.05, unpaired, two-tailed t-test).
  (K) Pathway analysis of genes with DSEs showed that they were strongly associated
  with mRNA processing. ns, not significant; *P<0.05, **P<0.01.
