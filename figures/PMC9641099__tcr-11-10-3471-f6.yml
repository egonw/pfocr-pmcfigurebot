caption: CENPM function could be regulated via AKT1/mTOR signaling pathway. (A) Enrichment
  curve of CENPM differentially co-expressed genes in the mTORC1 and AKT pathway in
  TCGA-LUNG database. (B) CENPM upregulation markedly increased p-AKT1 and p-mTOR
  expression in H292 cells, as measured by WB. Relative protein levels were determined
  after normalization to GAPDH. (C) CENPM downregulation markedly inhibited p-AKT1
  and p-mTOR expression in H1975 cells, as measured by WB. Relative protein levels
  were determined after normalization to GAPDH. (D) LY294002 treatment significantly
  reversed p-AKT1 and p-mTOR expression compared with oeCENPM treated cells. Bars
  indicate the means Â± SD. *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.001. CENPM, centromere
  protein M; ES, enrichment score; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; ns, not significant;
  mTORC1, mTOR complex 1; oe, overexpression; TCGA, the Cancer Genome Atlas; SD, standard
  deviation; WB, Western blot.
