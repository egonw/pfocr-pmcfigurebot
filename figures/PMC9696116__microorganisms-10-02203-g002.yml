caption: Effect of MJM60668 on HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells were stimulated with 1 nM
  Oleic acid and 7.5 µg/mL Cholesterol (OA-C) and treated with MJM60668 for 6 h. Simvastatin
  (1 µM) was used as a positive control. (a) Cell viability was measured by MTT assay.
  (b) Lipid accumulation on HepG2 cells was determined by the Oil Red O staining method.
  Results are presented as the mean ± standard deviation of triplicate independent
  experiments. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001 compared with the OA-C
  treatment.
