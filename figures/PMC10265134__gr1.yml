caption: Physiology of GcgR signaling in response to circulating hepatic portal vein
  concentrations of Gcg. The threshold for in vivo activation of the GcgR-Gαs-cAMP
  signaling axis within the liver is reliant on a glucagon (or glucagon analogue)
  concentration of > 100 pM within the hepatic portal vein (HPV) system , . Pharmacological
  intervention and intensive exercise activate the hepatic GcgR-Gαs-cAMP system by
  increasing HPV ligand concentration to > 100 pM. Thus, cAMP-mediated signaling acts
  as the primary mechanism for an acute maximization of hepatic glucose output. However,
  contention exists as to whether non-acute stimuli of glucose output, such as increases
  in endogenous glucagon via short-term fasting and starvation, elevate hepatic glucose
  output via the Gαs-cAMP pathway or if an alternative Gαq-IP3 axis is involved.
