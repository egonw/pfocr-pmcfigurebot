figure_title: ADAM15 affects the EGFR-FAK signalling pathways in ADAM15-overexpressing
  A549 cell lines and ADAM15-knockdown H1299 cell lines
caption: A Data from TCGA database and analysed by FunRich software (version 3.1.3).
  B, C Various protein mRNA and protein expression levels were measured by western
  blot analysis in ADAM15-overexpressing A549 cell lines and ADAM15-knockdown H1299
  cell lines. β-actin was used as a loading control. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
article_title: Integrin α3/α6 and αV are implicated in ADAM15-activated FAK and EGFR
  signalling pathway individually and promote non-small-cell lung cancer progression.
