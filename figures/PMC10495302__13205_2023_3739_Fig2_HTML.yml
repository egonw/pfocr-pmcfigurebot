caption: 'circDiaph3 inhibits the proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle
  cells (PASMCs). The expression levels of circDiaph3, Igf1r and PI3/Akt/mTOR pathway
  proteins in the cells were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot. After that, the
  translation of circDiaph3 was manipulated by siRNA and the expression of Igf1r and
  PI3/Akt/mTOR pathway was observed A qRT-PCR analysis of circDiaph3, α-SMA, Vcam1,
  Igf1r, PI3K, Akt, and mTOR in PASMCs. C After circDiaph3 knockdown, PASMC cycle
  analysis was performed by flow cytometry. D Immunostaining of α-SMA and VCAM1 in
  PASMCs post-circDiaph3 knockdown. B, E Western blot analysis of α-SMA, VCAM1, and
  signaling proteins of IGF-1 pathway in PASMCs. F Flow cytometry-based detection
  of PASMC apoptosis of post-circDiaph3 knockdown. Data are presented as the mean ± standard
  deviation; *: compared with the control group, p < 0.05'
article_title: CircDiaph3 influences PASMC apoptosis by regulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
  through IGF1R.
