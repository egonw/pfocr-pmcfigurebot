caption: CHAC1-mediated GSH depletion may be important for bortezomib chemosensitivity
  in MM cells increased by DHA/EPA pretreatment. (A) Heatmap analysis of the expression
  of ATF3, ATF4, NRF2, TAK, and TALDO1 in different conditions. (B) Summarizing scheme.
  Pretreating MM cells with DHA/EPA before bortezomib induces GSH degradation through
  activating the NRF2-ATF3/4-CHAC1 pathway, which eventually leads to cell death.
  Meanwhile, metabolic pathways of PPP, SSP, folate cycle, and methionine cycle may
  be activated to increase GSH synthesis to recover the cellular redox homeostasis
  during cell death.
