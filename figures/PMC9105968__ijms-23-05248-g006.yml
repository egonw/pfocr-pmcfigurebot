caption: 'Overview of the mechanism underlying the apoptotic activity of bLF including
  activation of Fas signaling pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells (A), mitochondrial-related
  pathway in MCF-7 cells (B) and inhibition of plasmalemmal V-H+-ATPase proton pumping
  of highly metastatic cancer cells (V-ATPase), bacteria (F-ATPase) as well as yeast
  (Pma1p). (A,B) The internalized, Apo-bLF and Fe-bLF via membrane bound LF receptors
  in the process of endocytosis, induce or/and inhibit key apoptotic proteins. (C)
  The inhibition of proton efflux trigger extracellular alkalinisation and intracellular
  acidification. Modulation of key apoptotic molecules level or processes that lead
  to cell death are indicated by the red arrows. pHi: intracellular pH; pHlys: lysosomal
  pH; pHvac: vacuolar pH; [ATP]i: intracellular ATP concentration; ψpm: plasma membrane
