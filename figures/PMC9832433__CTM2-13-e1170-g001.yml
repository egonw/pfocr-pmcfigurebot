caption: 'Neutrophils and NETs induce a pro‐coagulant endothelial cell phenotype via
  degradation of the anti‐coagulation system and up‐regulation of tissue factor. (A)
  GAGs play a key role in the anti‐coagulation system: HS primarily binds to AT to
  inhibit factor IIa and Xa, and DS mainly binds to HCII to inhibit factor IIa. Moreover,
  HS also interacts with HCII. So glycocalyx degradation induced by NETs contributes
  to the degradation of the anti‐coagulation system. (B) Furthermore, adhesion molecules
  and TF are exposed on the endothelium causing thrombus and fibrin formation. Aside
  from releasing TF‐enriched NETs, neutrophils increase expression levels of TF on
  endothelium through NET components. (C) Cathepsin G, elastase, PR3 and MPO can stimulate
  TF expression through different signalling pathways and further initiate the extrinsic
  coagulation pathway. Histone, another NET component, induces endothelial pro‐coagulant
  phenotype through up‐regulation of TF and down‐regulation of TM, and these effects
  are partly mediated by TLR2 and TLR4. Moreover, histone is capable of stimulating
  PS exposure, which enhances the pro‐coagulant activity of TF. Additionally, NETs
  can destroy the TM‐PC‐EPCR system, the most important natural anti‐coagulation mechanism,
  via NF‐κB activation. And NF‐κB signalling also promotes TACE activity, which is
  reportedly responsible for EPCR shedding. AM, adhesion molecule; APC, activated
