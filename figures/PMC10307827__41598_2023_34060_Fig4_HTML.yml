caption: 'Amifostine (AMI) reduces bleomycin (BLM)-induced apoptosis of alveolar epithelial
  cells. (a) Western blot analysis was used to detect the effect of AMI on the expression
  of cleaved caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2 in lung tissue. (b) Western blot density analysis.
  (c) Apoptotic cells in mouse lung tissue were stained with tunel kit and observed
  with fluorescence microscopy(magnification × 100 and × 200).Data are expressed as
  mean ± SD (n = 6). ⁎⁎P < 0.01 versus the control group. ##P < 0.01 and #P < 0.05
  versus the model group. &&P < 0.01 and &P < 0.05 versus the AMI 200-mg/kg group.'
article_title: Amifostine attenuates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice
  through inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.
