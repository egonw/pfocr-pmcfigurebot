figure_title: Subset of tumor-expressed genes disfavor CYT in highly immune-infiltrated
  human melanomas
caption: (A) To uncover tumor-expressed genes disfavoring T cell CYT against tumor
  cells, the transcriptional profile of TCGA melanoma samples, copy-number alteration
  (CNA) of TCGA tumors, and the transcriptome of tumor cells engaged with T cells
  were analyzed.(B) Published data of melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab ()
  were analyzed by stratifying patient tumors based on high and low expression of
  CD3E and CYT (geometric mean of GZMA and PRF1, with high and low representing above
  or below median values, respectively, with n = 21 patients in each group) and examining
  survival. Statistical analysis was performed using log rank (Mantel-Cox) test. n.s.,
  not significant.(C) TCGA melanoma patient samples were analyzed based on expression
  of CD3E and stratified based on above median expression. Stratified samples were
  profiled for genes whose expression was significantly correlated with CYT.(D) Correlation
  coefficients (Pearson correlation) were calculated for all genes in tumors with
  above median CD3E expression. Genes with positive correlations favor T cell CYT,
  while genes with negative correlations disfavor CYT.(E) Pathway enrichment analysis
  was performed on genes with significant negative correlations, and top pathways
  were plotted.(F) TCGA melanoma patient survival was calculated based on normalized
  expression of genes favoring CYT comparing groups with below and above median gene
  expression. Statistical analysis was performed using log rank (Mantel-Cox) test.(G)
  Transcriptional analysis of tumor-expressed genes disfavoring CYT that were induced
  by T cell interaction was performed by co-culturing NY-ESO-1 TCR-engineered T cells
  with NY-ESO-1 antigen-positive Mel624 cells at a 1:3 E:T ratio for 6 h. Tumor and
  T cells were purified by FACS sorting, and each population was subjected to RNA
  sequencing (RNA-seq).(H) Volcano plot representing differentially expressed genes
  analyzed by RNA-seq of Mel624 cells that were co-cultured with ESO T cells for 0
  or 6 h. Abundance is represented as relative fold change (x axis) versus significance
  (y axis).(I) Pathway enrichment analysis (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) of Mel624
  genes significantly upregulated by T cell interaction.
