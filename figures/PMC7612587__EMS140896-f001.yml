figure_title: Silencing of apoptotic pathway genes confers resistance to agonists
  of the death receptor pathway
caption: 'Volcano plots of genes enriched or depleted for gRNA when rTRAIL-treated
  cells were compared to DMSO vehicle control cells following transduction with a
  genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 library in (A) MSTO-211H mesothelioma and (B) PC-9 lung
  adenocarcinoma cells. Each dot represents gene-wise scores for Mageck gene level
  analysis with genes of interest highlighted. The dotted line indicates a false discovery
  rate (FDR) of 0.1. X-axis, log2 fold change of mean gRNA reads per genes comparing
  treatment to DMSO replicates. Y-axis, -log10 FDR for genes based upon their negative
  (Pink and red dots) and positive (blue dots) fold change and FDR calculated by the
  MAGeCK algorithm. (C) Deletion of target apoptotic genes following transfection
  with synthetic crRNA in MSTO-211H, NCI-H28 and H2804 cancer cells. (D) 6-day viability
  assay in MSTO-211H cells following deletion of specific apoptotic genes and treatment
  with either rTRAIL or MEDI3039. Y-Axis - viability effect relative to control cells.
  (E) Volcano plots as in A/B illustrating results of SAM CRISPR activatory screen
  in PC-9 cells treated with rTRAIL: (F) MSTO-211H isogenic cell lines were screened
  versus the parental cell line with a concentration range of 60 compounds and viability
  measured at day 6. The AUC (area-under-the-curve) values for each isogenic cell
  line and the matched parental Cas9 line were subtracted to calculate a deltaAUC
  value, with high (positive) values indicating increased resistance to that compound
  in the isogenic lines, and low (negative) values increased sensitivity. X-axis -
  name of compounds screened. Y-Axis - delta AUC values.'
