figure_title: Expression of CAD-regulated genes is associated with poor prognosis
  in cancer patients
caption: The prognostic impact of CAD deficient gene signatures on survival of patients
  from the TCGA data collection was examined using the CoxPH model. Association of
  a CAD-signature derived from Hela (A) and MDA-MB-231 (B) with survival. Signatures
  comprised of genes differentially expressed between control and CAD-deficient cells
  (padj < 0.01). Patients were assigned to high- vs. low-risk groups based on their
  expression levels of the signature genes in tumour vs. normal tissue. In all cases,
  a significant separation (log-rank p < 10−8) between high and low risk subjects
  is achieved. C, D Distant metastasis-free survival in a cohort of 958 breast cancer
  patients stratified according to the expression of the 10 most downregulated genes
  in each cell line.
