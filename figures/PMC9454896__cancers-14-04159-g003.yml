caption: SNHG1 over-expression promoted the stability of Rac1 mRNA by inhibiting miR-129-2-5p
  induction in BC cells. (A) The Rac1 mRNA levels were quantified in T24T(Vector)
  and T24T(SNHG1) cells by real-time PCR with GAPDH as an internal control. (B) The
  T24T(Vector) and T24T(SNHG1) cells were seeded into 6-well plates; after synchronization,
  the cells were treated with Act-D for 0, 10, and 20h. Total RNA was then isolated
  and subjected to the real-time PCR quantification of Rac1 mRNA with GAPDH as an
  internal control. (C) The Rac1 mRNA 3′-UTR luciferase reporter was transiently transfected
  into the indicated cells, and the luciferase activity of each transfectant was assayed
  and normalized using pRL-TK as an internal control and presented relative to the
  vector transfectant. (D) Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out to determine
  the expression levels of key miRNAs in the indicated cells. (E) Stable transfection
  of miR-129-2 plasmids into T24T(SNHG1) cells, followed by the detection of miR-129-5p
  by real-time PCR. (F, Top panel) Protein lysates extracted from the indicated cells
  were subjected to Western blotting to assess Rac1 expression. β-Actin served as
  a loading control. (F, Bottom panel) Relative protein levels determined by densitometry
  and expressed as ratios versus β-Actin. (G) Quantitative real-time PCR was carried
  out to determine the expression of Rac1 mRNA in the indicated cells. (H) Wild-type
  Rac1 3′-UTR mRNA luciferase reporters were transiently co-transfected with pRL-TK
  into the indicated cells. The luciferase activity of each transfectant was evaluated,
  and the results are presented relative to Rac1 3′-UTR activity. (I) T24T(SNHG1)
  and T24T(SNHG1/miR-129-2) cells were incubated with Act-D for 0, 10, and 20h. Total
  RNA was isolated, and quantitative real-time PCR was then performed to determine
  Rac1 mRNA levels. The results are presented as means  ±  SD from triplicate experiments,
  and asterisks (*) indicate a significant difference in comparison to T24T(SNHG1)
  cells (p  <  0.01). (J,K) T24T(SNHG1) and T24T(SNHG1/miR-129-2) cells were seeded
  into ultra-low attachment plates to determine sphere formation. Seven days later,
  the representative images of spheres were captured under microscopy (J), and the
  number of spheres was counted and presented relative to T24T(SNHG1) cells (K). (L,M)
  T24T(SNHG1) cells and T24T(SNHG1/miR-129-2) cells were subjected to a transwell
  invasion assay (L), and migration and invasion were calculated and presented relative
  to the T24T(SNHG1) control. The results are presented as means  ±  SD from triplicate
  experiments, and asterisks (*) indicate a significant decrease in comparison to
  T24T(SNHG1) cells (p  <  0.01) (M). Bars in (J) are equal to 200 μM and equal to
  100 μm in (L).
