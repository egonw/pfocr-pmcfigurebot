caption: The coexpression network of FOXO1 in BRCA. (a) The coexpressed genes of FOXO1
  were identified though the LinkedOmics platform. (b, c) The 50 genes having positive
  and negative correlations with FOXO1 were presented on heat maps. Red implied positively
  related genes, while blue indicated negatively related genes. (d, e) The top 50
  genes positively and negatively connected with FOXO1 were displayed on the survival
  heat maps. (f) The KEGG pathway annotation of FOXO1 coexpressed genes in BRCA.
