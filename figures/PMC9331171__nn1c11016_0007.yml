caption: Cascade responses to SF MN-induced alteration of mechanical cues in the FPCL
  system. (A) Western blotting of TGF-β1, α-SMA, and ANKRD1. (B) Semiquantitative
  statistics of protein levels of (A), p < 0.01, n = 3. (C, D) Heat map and quantitative
  statistics of down-regulated genes involved in the cellular response to mechanical
  stimulus and the ECM in fibroblasts with SF MNs (fold change ≥ 4 and p < 0.05).
  (E) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis based
  on the down-regulated genes. (F) Protein–protein interaction network of down-regulated
  genes involved in the ECM matrix and focal adhesion pathways.
