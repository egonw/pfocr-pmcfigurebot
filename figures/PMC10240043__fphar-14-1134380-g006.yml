caption: The effect of PUE on oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R)-induced
  ROS release of hippocampal neurons. (A) The reactive oxygen species (ROS) level
  induced by OGD/R was detected by fluorescence microscopy (×200). The mean of fluorescence
  intensity is shown in (B). (C) ROS generation was determined with DCFH-DA staining
  and analyzed by Flow Jo. The mean of fluorescence intensity is shown in (D). (a)
  Control group; (b) OGD/R group; (c) PUE (150 nM) + OGD/R; (d) PUE (200 nM) + OGD/R;
  (e) PUE (250 nM) + OGD/R; (f) edaravone. All data are expressed as means ± SD (n
  = 3). *p < 0.05 or **p < 0.01 vs. OGD/R group.
