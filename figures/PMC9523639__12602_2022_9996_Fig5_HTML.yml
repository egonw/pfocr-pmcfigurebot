caption: The expression level of phosphorylated MAPKs induced by heat-treated L. brevis
  KU15159 in RAW 264.7 cells. The cells were incubated with LPS (1 ng/mL) or heat-treated
  bacterial sample (7 log CFU/mL) for 5 min. a Expression of proteins in the MAPK
  signaling pathway was investigated through western blotting. b–d Relative quantification
  of protein bands using ImageJ. LGG, L. rhamnosus GG; 159, L. brevis KU15159. Statistical
  differences are indicated using different letters (p < 0.05)
