caption: 'Synergistic effects of the combination of IRIN with radiation therapy. (A–B)
  The IC50 of IRIN in HCT8 (A) and HT29 (B) cells exposed to X-ray 0 Gy (red) and
  2 Gy (blue). (C) Dose responses of the survival fractions of HCT8 cells treated
  with (blue) and without (red) IRIN (1 μM). SER = 1.25. (D) Representative fluorescence
  microscopy demonstrating ROS production in HCT8 cells with different treatments.
  Intracellular ROS level was evaluated by the fluorescent probe DCFH-DA. Green: ROS-positive
  cells. Bar: 50 μm. (E) Fluorescence quantitation of ROS measurement. Fluorescent
  intensity was quantified by ImageJ software. Data were presented as mean ± SD. At
  least three representative images were analyzed for each treatment. (F) Flow cytometry
  of apoptosis of HCT8 cells exposing to different treatments. Annexin V and PI staining
  was used to identify viable cells (annexin V−, PI−), early apoptotic cells (annexin
  V+, PI−), late apoptotic or necrotic cells (annexin V+, PI+), and necrotic cells
  (annexin V−, PI+). (G) Percentage of apoptotic cells analyzed from (F). Data were
  presented as mean ± SD, n = 3. (H) The synergistic effect of radiation therapy and
  IRIN on HCT8 cells. Corresponding to each treatment (x-axis and y-axis), the Bliss
  synergy score was presented on the z-axis. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 (One-way
  ANOVA, followed by Tukey''s test). (For interpretation of the references to colour
  in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)'
