caption: 'Functional enrichment analyses. (A) Network diagram of 13 miRNAs and potential
  target genes (blue dots are nodes representing the differentially expressed genes,
  and squares indicate the miRNAs; their size indicates the number of targeted genes),
  (B) significant KEGG pathway and GO enrichment analysis of candidate hub genes on
  the predicted targets of each up-regulated miRNA (dot size reflects the number of
  genes in each GO pathway, FDR, Padj < 0.05), (C) the network diagram of mmu-miR-19a-3p
  overlaps for serum and brain tissues (blue dots for target genes), (D) significant
  KEGG pathways and GO functions for the target genes of mmu-miR-19a-3p (dot size
  reflects the number of genes in each GO pathway, FDR, Padj < 0.05). Abbreviations:
  [1] signaling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells; [2] protein modification
  by small protein conjugation or removal, FDR; false discovery rate.'
