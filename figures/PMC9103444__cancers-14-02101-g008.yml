caption: Brief sketch map of our conclusions in this review. (a) A certain lncRNA
  regulates chemoresistance in a subtype of BC cell via various signalling pathways;
  (b) a certain lncRNA induces different subtypes of BC cells to resist chemotherapeutic
  agents via the same signalling pathway; (c) a certain subtype of BC cell is regulated
  by various lncRNAs via the same signalling pathway. (d) The lncRNAs UCA1, ROR and
  GAS5 are used as examples to provide a further detailed explanation.
