caption: 'MiR-195-5p targets FOSL1 to inhibit the proliferation and migration of GBC
  cells. (A) CCK-8 assays were used to examine cell viability of stable GBC-SD and
  NOZ cell lines after transfection. (B,C) Wound healing assays were shown in stable
  GBC-SD and NOZ cell lines after transfection. Cell migration was observed using
  a microscope (original magnification, ×100). (D,E) Transwell assays were used to
  detect cell invasion capacities of stable GBC-SD and NOZ cell lines after transfection
  (dyeing with crystal violet; original magnification, ×200). (F,G) Flow cytometry
  was used to assess the cell cycle distribution of stable GBC-SD and NOZ cell lines
  transfected with miR-195-5p mimics and inhibitor or the control cells for 24 h and
  stained with PI. Data are mean ± SD. GBC-SD: *P<0.05 compared with NC-mimic + oe-NC
  group; #P<0.05 compared with NC-mimic + oe-FOSL1 group. NOZ: *P<0.05 compared with
  NC-inhibitor + sh-NC group; #P<0.05 compared with NC-mimic + sh-FOSL1 #1 group;
  &P<0.05 compared with NC-mimic + sh-FOSL1 #2 group. The experiment was repeated
  3 times. oe-NC, overexpress negative control; oe-FOSL1, overexpress Fos-like antigen-1;
  sh-FOSL1, short hairpin Fos-like antigen-1; sh-NC, short hairpin negative control;
  GBC, gallbladder cancer; CCK-8, Cell Counting Kit-8; PI, propidium iodide.'
