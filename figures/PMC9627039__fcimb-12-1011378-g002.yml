caption: C. sinensis infection resulted in activation of sphingolipid metabolic pathways.
  (A) qRT-PCR assays were performed to measure the mRNA levels of enzymes involved
  in sphingolipid metabolic pathway, including Sptlc1, Sptlc3, Cers2, Cers4, Smpd2,
  Smpd3, Smpd4, Samd8, Sgms2, Galc, Gba2, Gla, Ugcg, Asah1, Asah2, Acer2, Acer3, Cerk,
  Neu2, Neu3, Sgpl1, Sgpp1, Sgpp2, Sphk1, and Sphk2. (B) The results schemed as a
  diagram. (C) Western blotting analysis of the protein expression levers of Sphk1
  and Sphk2 in the liver of control and C. sinensis-infected mice. (D) The gene expression
  levels of ABC transporter protein. Measurement of the Abcb1a relative mRNA expression
  in liver tissue of control and C. sinensis infected mice. (E) The concentration
  of S1P in liver was determined by ELISA in control and C. sinensis-infected mice.
  Compared with control group, *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.
