caption: 'The roles played by SIRT6 in the regulation of oxidative stress and inflammation.
  (A) Oxidative stress: SIRT6 deacetylates H3K56 at the promoter of Nrf2 target genes
  and is a bridge that recruits the NRF2-RNAP II transcription complex, thereby upregulating
  antioxidant enzyme expression. Furthermore, in response to oxidative stress, SIRT6
  mono-ADP-ribosylates BAF170 at K312 to promote the recruitment of the SWI/SNF complex
  to the promoter region of HO-1, facilitating chromatin loop formation at the HO-1
  locus to reduce the total physical volume between the enhancer and transcription
  start site. On the promoter of Mt1/2, SIRT6 physically interacts with and deacetylates
  Mtf1, coactivating the transcription of Mt1 and Mt2 to boost cell defenses against
  reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, increased Mt1 and Mt2 levels promote the
  GSH-GSSH system to counteract oxidative stress. SIRT6 deacetylates NAMPT at K53
  to promote its activity, increasing cellular NAD+ and NADPH levels, which confers
  cell resistance against oxidative stress damage. Increased NAD+ levels also upregulate
  SIRT6 deacetylase activity. (B) Inflammation: Through deacetylating H3K9 on the
  promoter of NF-κB target genes, SIRT6 prevents the binding of RelA to chromatin,
  repressing proinflammatory factor expression. In addition, SIRT6 directly interacts
  with and deacetylates RelA at K310, which restricts its DNA binding activity, terminating
  NF-κB signaling. Under TNF-α stimulation, IκBα is phosphorylated, subsequently ubiquitinated
  and eventually degraded, which leads to the translocation of NF-κB (RelA/p50) to
  the nucleus, where it binds to target gene promoters and regulates their expression.
  Moreover, TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB activates SIRT6, which in turn deacetylates
  the E3 ubiquitin ligase SKP2 at K73 and K77, resulting in subsequent phosphorylation
  of SKP2. These modifications enhance the stability and nuclear content of SKP2,
  contributing to SKP2-mediated monoubiquitination of Suv39h1 and subsequent Suv39h1
  release from the promoter of IκBα. Then, the H3K9 demethylation rate is increased,
  and H3S10 is phosphorylated by IKKα on the IκBα promoter, eventually promoting the
  transcription of IκBα. The product of SIRT6-mediated deacetylation OAADPr and its
  derivative ADPr activate TRPM2 to promote Ca2+ influx, thereby promoting TNF-α and
  IL-8 expression through the calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)
  pathway. SIRT6 promotes TNF-α secretion by removing the fatty acyl groups from K19/20.
  SIRT6 upregulates TNF-α mRNA translation efficiency.'
