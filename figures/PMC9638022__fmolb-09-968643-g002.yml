caption: Composition of the Caco-2 metabolome. The 71 metabolic pathways of the Caco-2
  metabolome were classified into 13 categories. The classification was based on the
  KEGG nomenclature. Main categories to which only one pathway belongs were aggregated
  under “Other”. The bar chart shows the percentage of metabolic pathways assigned
  to main categories in black, and the corresponding distribution of metabolites in
  striped. The figure is ranked according to the percentage of pathways assigned from
  largest to smallest share.
