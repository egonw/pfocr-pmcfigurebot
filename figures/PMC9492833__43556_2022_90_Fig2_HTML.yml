caption: Intracellular vesicle trafficking pathways. a The SNAREs, SM proteins, tethering
  proteins and other fusogenic proteins in intracellular vesicle trafficking pathways.
  In mammalian cells, intracellular vesicle trafficking includes the ER-to-Golgi transport,
  the retrograde Golgi-to-ER transport, the TGN transport, the endocytic pathway,
  the membrane trafficking in autophagy and others. Different SNAREs and fusogenic
  proteins are assigned to different vesicle trafficking pathways. (Red, Qa-SNARE
  family; Light green, Qbc-SNARE family; Blue, R-SNARE family; Brown, SM protein;
  Pink, Tethering protein; Yellow, other fusogenic protein). Vps45, Vacuolar protein
  sorting 45 homolog; GARP, Golgi-associated retrograde protein. b The working model
  of vesicle transport and tethering. Rab GTPases mediates vesicle transport along
  the cytoskeleton tracks (actin filaments or microtubules) by indirectly binding
  via motor adaptors or directly binding to motor proteins. After cargo containing
  vesicles being loaded, motor proteins drive vesicles moving along cytoskeleton tracks
  to the destination by hydrolysis of ATP. Afterwards, GTP-bound Rab recruits tethering
  proteins to dock vesicles with the acceptor membrane. The copyright permission of
