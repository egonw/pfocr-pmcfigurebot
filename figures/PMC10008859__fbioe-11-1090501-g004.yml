caption: Chromosomal constitutive expression of an MCFA biosynthetic pathway and the
  functional analysis of the secreted MCFAs. (A). Schematic of the recombinant plasmid
  pESC-HR harboring the MCFA biosynthetic pathway under the control of constitutive
  promoters (PTEF1 and PTDH3). (B). The time-course production level of MCFAs secreted
  into the medium. The data was obtained from at least three independent experiments.
  (C). MCFAs secreted by CLPY02 in YGD medium. (D). Effect of the MCFA-containing
  supernatant from CLPY04 (HR) on hyphal formation at pH5.5. Control, the supernatant
  of CLPY01 which does not contain MCFAs. (E). Effect of Supernatant HR on biofilm
  formations in the customized DMEM. Supernatant C, the supernatant of CLPY01. Supernatant
  C    MCFAs, Supernatant C with MCFA spike-in. (F). Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analysis
  of the gene profile in SC5314 co-cultured with Supernatant HR. Expression of genes
  related to biofilm and hyphal formation was analyzed. Supernatant C was used as
  a control. Reference gene, ACT1. A dotted line indicates FC1.0, representing the
  fold change (FC) of genes from the control. The pH of Supernatant C and Supernatant
  HR was adjusted to 5.5 prior to co-culturing. **, p < 0.01 (Studentâ€™s t-test).
