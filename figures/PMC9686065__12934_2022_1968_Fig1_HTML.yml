caption: The metabolic pathway and the proposed scheme illustrating how CCD1 overexpression
  affects α-ionone production by oxidative stress. (i) The pathway with low oxidative
  stress, namely strain AI_0000. (ii) The pathway with high oxidative stress, namely
  strain AI_2211. (iii) The pathway with low oxidative stress due to H2O2 elimination
  by AhpC/F, namely strain AI_2218
article_title: Mediating oxidative stress enhances α-ionone biosynthesis and strain
  robustness during process scaling up.
