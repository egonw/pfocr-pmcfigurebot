caption: CF regulates the MAPK/AP-1 signaling pathway. (A–D) RAW264.7 macrophage cells
  were treated with CF (0.1 and 1 µM) for 30 min before treatment with LPS (500 ng/mL).
  After 6 h, the cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with the indicated
  antibodies (A,C) and then quantified (B,D). (E) RAW264.7 macrophages were transfected
  with the AP-1-luc reporter. After 24 h, the cells were pretreated with CF (0.1 and
  1 µM) for 30 min before LPS (500 ng/mL) treatment for 6 h, and luciferase activities
  in the cell lysates were measured. The results are plotted as the mean ± SD of three
  individual experiments. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; n.s., nonsignificant.
