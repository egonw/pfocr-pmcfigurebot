caption: Identification of long non‐coding RNA (lncRNA) SLC25A21‐AS1 in oesophageal
  squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells. (A and B) The gene set enrichment analysis
  (GSEA) function enrichment analysis with RNA‐seq for the ESCC cells treated with
  100‐μM palmitic acid (PA). The TNF signalling, inflammatory response, P53 pathway,
  and apoptosis were activated with PA treatment. The E2F targets, MYC targets, and
  DNA repair were inhibited with PA treatment. (C) A Venn diagram of the upregulated
  (right) and downregulated (left) lncRNAs under 100‐μM PA in three ESCC cell lines.
  (D) A heatmap of differentially regulated lncRNAs (i.e., with a fold chance >1 and
  a p‐value <.05). The four lncRNAs highlighted in red font indicate the lncRNAs intersected
  with the GSE53625 dataset. (E) SLC25A21‐AS1 expression was associated with overall
  survival (OS) and RFS in the GSE53625 dataset. (F) Significant associations of SLC25A21‐AS1
  overexpression with clinical characteristics, including hyperlipidaemia, tumour
  differentiation grade, and TNM stage in the GSE53625 dataset. (G) SLC25A21‐AS1 expression
  was reduced in ESCC cells treated with different PA concentrations (0–100 μM) as
  detected by RT‐qPCR. (H) The subcellular location of SLC25A21‐AS1 was mainly in
  the nucleus as detected by RT‐qPCR. U99 and GAPDH are nuclear and cytoplasmic markers.
  (I) Enrichment of SLC25A21‐AS1 in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (red) as detected
  by RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Diamidino‐2‐phenylindole staining
  cell nuclear is indicated in blue. The data are shown as mean ± SD. *p < .05; **p
  < .01; ***p < .001

  of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma by regulating the NPM1/c‐Myc axis and SLC25A21
  expression.
