caption: 'NRG1 controls the synthesis of DNA in trophoblasts through the NF-κB signaling
  pathway. (A) Representative EdU uptake assay results for trophoblasts overexpressing
  NRG1 that had been treated with the NF-κB pathway inhibitor triptolide (0 or 0.5
  pM). (B) Representative flow cytometry plots corresponding to the cell cycle distributions
  of trophoblasts overexpressing NRG1 that had or had not been treated with triptolide.
  (C) NRG1 and NF-κB signaling proteins were detected in transfected trophoblasts
  that had or had not been treated with triptolide via Western immunoblotting. (D)
  NRG1, p-P65, P65 in nuclear and in cytoplasm protein expression was detected in
  transfected trophoblasts that had or had not been treated with triptolide via Western
  immunoblotting. Student''s t-test: **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.'
