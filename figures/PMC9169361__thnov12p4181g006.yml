caption: Higher AMES confers higher immune infiltration and potential ICB response
  in BLCA. (A) A fgsea algorithm was performed with all GOBP gene sets in different
  AMES groups, and the most significantly altered pathway was annotated as “adaptive
  immune response” in the AMES-high group (NES = 2.16, p = 1.8e-28). (B) A correlation
  network depicts the relationships among AMES and various immune cell types in bulk
  samples. AMES held significantly positive correlations with activated CD4+ memory
  T cell, CD8+ T cell and M1 abundance, while negatively correlated with CD4+ naïve
  and activated MDC populations. (C) As AMES level increased, the immune infiltration
  score was stepwisely and significantly elevated, (D) as well as the CD8+ T cell
  abundance. (E) A T cell-inflamed GEP (18 genes) which is correlated with ICB response
  was introduced to evaluate the predictive potential of AMES for cancer immunotherapy.
  As shown in the heatmap, the T cell-inflamed GEP holds extensively high expressions
  in samples with the highest AMES compared to those with the lowest AMES, (F) and
  ssGSEA algorithm validated that the T cell-inflamed score was significantly elevated
  in the AMES > 4 group. (G) GSEA was performed with three relevant but independent
  gene sets, and IFN-γ response was significantly enhanced in the AMES > 4 group.
  (H) IFNG mRNA expression (log2-normalized) is significantly elevated in the AMES
  > 4 group. (I) Representative immune checkpoints including PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4,
  and TIGIT were extensively elevated in the AMES > 4 group, (J) as well as the CYT
  score. (K) SubMap analysis revealed that the AMES > 4 group exhibited a high likelihood
  of response to ICB when compared to two immunotherapy cohorts (IMvigor210 and Roh's
  cohort). (L) With a threshold of FDR q < 0.01, a total of 401 DEGs (296 upregulated
  and 105 downregulated genes) were identified in the AMES > 4 group. (M) Most DEGs
  were enriched in immune-related pathways. (N) A PPI network reveals interactions
  among representative DEGs based on the STRING database.
