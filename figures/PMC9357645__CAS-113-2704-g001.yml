caption: CD73/NT5E is overexpressed and predicts poor prognosis in head and neck squamous
  cell carcinoma (HNSCC). A, Expression of NT5E in HNSCC tissues (n = 81) compared
  with paired adjacent normal tissues (n = 81) in the Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Oral
  Disease (JKLOD) cohort and the significance of difference was evaluated by paired
  t test. B, Expression of NT5E in HNSCC tissues (n = 502) compared with adjacent
  normal tissues (n = 44) in the TCGA‐HNSCC cohort and the significance of difference
  was evaluated by unpaired t test. C, Western blot detecting the expression of CD73
  in 10 pairs of HNSCC tissues and adjacent normal tissues. D, Immunohistochemistry
  (IHC) staining of CD73 in HNSCC tissues and adjacent normal tissues. E, F, Kaplan‐Meier
  curves for the overall survival and relapse‐free survival of 502 patients in the
  TCGA‐HNSCC cohort divided into NT5E_high and NT5E_low groups according to NT5E expression.
  HR, hazard ratio. G, H, Kaplan‐Meier curves for the overall survival and disease‐free
  survival of 122 patients divided into NT5E_high and NT5E_low groups according to
  CD73 expression by IHC staining. I, Multivariate Cox regression analysis of CD73
  by IHC score along with clinical prognostic parameters for 122 HNSCC patients. ns,
  not significant; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001
