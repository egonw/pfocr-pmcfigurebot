caption: 'The function of GSK-3 in insulin and Wntsignalling When the Wnt or insulin
  pathways are activated ligand-dependently, Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 is inhibited
  by cause of it antagonises certain branches of these pathways. By phosphorylating
  GSK-3''s N-terminus (P-GSK-3: phosphorylated GSK-3), Akt is activated by insulin
  and inhibits GSK-3 as a result. Through a mechanism that is unidentified and separate
  from N-terminal phosphorylation, wntsignalling inhibits GSK-3 linked to the axin
  complex. In order to enable GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation of β-catenin, the scaffold
  protein axin binds directly to both GSK-3 and β-catenin. Catenin is quickly degraded
  as a result of phosphorylation within this complex. As well as directly binding
  to axin and b-catenin, Adenomatous Polyposis Coli is necessary for the phosphorylation
  and destruction of β-catenin. According to the text, the pool of GSK-3 that is linked
  to the axin-APC complex is inaccessible to Akt and is consequently shielded from
  the insulin route. Axin-bound and insulin-regulated pools of GSK-3 are both directly
  inhibited by lithium, which causes lithium to activate intermediate effectors for
  both pathways Given the various ways that GSK-3 is regulated, it is conceivable
  to create inhibitors that block GSK-3 in a specific signalling pathway without impacting
  other signalling pathways.'
