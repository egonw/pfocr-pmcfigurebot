caption: 'IL-4Rα pathway in the presynapse. (A–D) Exemplary images of STED microscopy
  for IL-4Rα and synaptic markers in hippocampal stratum radiatum of adult mice. Representative
  images of two independent experiments. Boxed areas are enlarged for improved visualization.
  (A) IL-4Rα (green) colocalizes (arrows) with presynaptic Syn1 (red). (B) IL-4Rα
  is in close proximity (arrow) to the active zone protein Bsn (red), but not to Homer-1
  (magenta, arrowhead). (C) Inhibitory synapses marked by VGAT (red) also express
  IL-4Rα (arrows). (D) IL-4Rα expression in excitatory synapses marked by VGLUT1 (red,
  arrows). (E–G) STED microscopy in human postmortem brain tissue shows overlap (arrows)
  of IL-4Rα (green) with (E) Syn1 (red), (F) VGLUT1 (red), and (G) VGAT (red). (H)
  Schematic summary of presynaptic IL-4Rα localization. (I) Quantification of colocalization
  of IL-4Rα with VGLUT and VGAT in murine stratum radiatum. (J) ImmunoEM of synapse
  in stratum radiatum of Balb/C WT (The Jackson Laboratory) showing expression on
  the membrane (arrows) and vesicles (arrowhead). (K) Expression is abolished in Balb/C.il4ra−/−
  synapse. Boxed areas (1–4) are enlarged for improved visualization. Representative
  images of three independent experiments. (L) Co-IP with anti–IL-4Rα or isotype IgG
  control on synaptosomes shows presence of GAP-43 (∼50 kD) in the presynaptic signaling
  pathway. Input represents total synaptosome lysate; output corresponds to the co-IP
  product; GAP-43 was absent in isotype control. Based on three independent experiments.
  (M) Representative Western blot (three independent experiments) of pPKCγ (∼90 kD)
  and β-actin (∼40 kD) for PBS and IL-4–treated ultrapure synaptosomes. (N) Quantification
  shows induction of PKCγ phosphorylation by IL-4 (n = 6) compared to PBS (n = 5).
  (O) Schematic representation of IL-4R signaling pathway in presynapse. (P) Quantification
  of IL-4 expression relative to RPS29, normalized to spleen reveals IL-4 expression
  in hippocampus and cortex, abolished in IL-4 KO (n = 4 per group). Scale bars =
  1 µm (A–G); 50 nm (J and K). Plots (I, N, and P) depict mean ± SEM. Statistics:
  Bayesian analysis, accuracy, * >80%, ** >90%, *** >95% (see ). Source data are available
