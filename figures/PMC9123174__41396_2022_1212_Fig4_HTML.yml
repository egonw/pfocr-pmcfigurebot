caption: 'Colours indicate the presence of genes in either both (orange) or only one
  (yellow = Ca. P. baldrii, pink = Ca. P. hodrii) species. For specific genes of pathways
  see Supplementary Data Files ,  and . Abbreviations: EMP pathway, Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas
  pathway (glycolysis); TCA cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle; electron transport chain
  (I, complex I NADH dehydrogenase; II, complex II succinate dehydrogenase; III, complex
  III cytochrome bc1; IV, cytochrome c oxidase; IV, cytochrome bd oxidase); nitrate
  reductase respiratory (NarGHI), nitrite reductase (NirK), TAT and SEC dedicated
  protein secretion, inorganic phosphate transporter family (Pit), inorganic phosphate
  ABC transporter (PstABCS), phosphate transport system accessory protein (PhoU),
  two-component system for phosphate regulation (PhoRB), polyphosphate (Poly-P), polyphosphate
  kinase (PPK), acetate kinase (AckA), phosphotransacetylase (Pta), acetyl-CoA synthetase
  (Acs), N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate deacetylase (NagA), glucosamine-6-phosphate
  deaminase (NagB), ethanolamine utilisation protein (EutA), ethanolamine ammonia-lyase
  (EutBC), acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (EutE). Question marks indicate unknown uses
  or transporters.'
