caption: 'Functional interactions and biological pathways. Panel (A). Gene Ontology
  (GO) database describes three main functional classes: cellular components, biological
  processes and molecular function. A few typical examples are given to illustrate
  the variety of classifiers. Panel (B). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
  details functional relationships within metabolic pathways, genetic information
  processing, environmental information processing, cellular process, organismal systems,
  and human disease pathways. The progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation pathway
  (hsa04914) is shown as an example of a relevant pathway.'
