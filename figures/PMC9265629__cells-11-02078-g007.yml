caption: AXL inhibitor R428 reversed EMT and cell migration induced by integrin β3
  in NSCLC cells. (A,B) Western blot assays showing the effects of R428 on E-cadherin
  and vimentin expression in ectopic integrin β3-expressing (+β3) HCC827 (A) and HCC4006
  (B) cells. (C,D) Transwell migration assays showing the effects of R428 on cell
  migration in ectopic integrin β3-expressing (+β3) HCC827 (C) and HCC4006 (D) cells.
  (D) Data represent the means ± SEM, * p < 0.05. (A–D) n = 3 independent experiments.
