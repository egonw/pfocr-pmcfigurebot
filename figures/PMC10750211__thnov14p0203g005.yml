caption: 'In vitro investigation of PLLF/Cas9-sgDAD1 NPs on bladder tumor inhibition.
  The alterations of DAD1 mRNA A) and protein B) in 5637 cells after different treatments
  including group 1 (G1): Blank, group 2 (G2): PLL/Cas9-sgDAD1, group 3 (G3): PEI/
  Cas9-sgDAD1, group 4 (G4): PLLF/ Cas9-sgDAD1 and group 5 (G5): TETM/ Cas9-sgDAD1.
  C) The cell toxicity of SV-HUC-1 and 5637 cells with G1-G5 treatments. D) Flow cytometry
  analysis of 5637 cell apoptosis with G1-G5 treatments. E) The corresponding percentages
  of apoptotic cells. Data are represented as Mean ± SD (N = 3). F) Confocal fluorescence
  images of 3D tumor spheroids formed by 5637 cells showing the dead cells (red) after
  G2-G5 treatments. Scale bar: 200 μm. G) Pathway enrichment analysis of 33 DEGs between
  control and PLLF/Cas9-sgDAD1 treated 5637 cells. H) Western blotting assay showing
  the expression of ERK, P38, JNK, pERK, pP38 and pJNK in PLLF and PLLF/Cas9-sgDAD1
  treated 5637 cells. ***P < 0.001.'
