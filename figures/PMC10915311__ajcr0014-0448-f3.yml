caption: NTS from neural conditioned medium increased pancreatic cancer invasiveness.
  Conditioned medium of neural-like human SH-SY5Y cell line and mouse Neuro-2a cell
  line were treated onto MIA PaCa-2 (left column) and KPC (right column), respectively,
  and the effect on migration (A) and invasion (B) was assayed. *, P<0.05.
