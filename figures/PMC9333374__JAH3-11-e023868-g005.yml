figure_title: EuKaryotic Ortholog Groups (KOG) of proteins and Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of the differentially expressed proteins
  (DEPs) between the wild‐type (WT) and carnosine synthase transgenic (CarnsTg) hearts
caption: 'The Uniprot IDs of total proteins identified in the WT and CarnsTg hearts
  (n=3 in each group) via tandem mass spectrometry analysis were used to annotate
  the proteins with the corresponding KOG annotation. Functional enrichment analysis
  of (A) upregulated proteins showed that the greatest number of these proteins were
  allocated to metabolism and (B) downregulated proteins showed that the greatest
  number of these proteins were allocated to cellular processes and signaling. C,
  KEGG enrichment analysis: the vertical axis represents the pathway terms with high
  enrichment and the horizontal axis represents the Rich factor. The size of the q
  value is represented by the color of the dots. The smaller the q value, the closer
  the color is towards red. D, Enrichment of the specific KEGG pathway annotations
  for the upregulated (red) and downregulated (blue) proteins in the CarnsTg hearts.
  TCA indicates citric acid cycle.'
