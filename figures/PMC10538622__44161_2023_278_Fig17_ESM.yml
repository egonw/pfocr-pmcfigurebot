  lesions
caption: 'A. Total cholesterol levels in plasma of ApoE-/- mice treated with western
  diet (WD), WD plus atorvastatin (10 mg/kg/day) (AT), WD plus saracatinib 6.25 mg/kg/day
  (S6.25), WD plus saracatinib 12.5 mg/kg/day (S12.5), WD plus saracatinib 25 mg/kg/day
  (S25), WD plus atorvastatin (10 mg/kg/day) and saracatinib 12.5 mg/kg/day (S12.5 + AT),
  WD plus atorvastatin (10 mg/kg/day) and saracatinib 25 mg/kg/day (S25 + AT); WD:
  n = 10; AT: n = 10; S6.25: n = 10; S12.5: n = 10; S25: n = 10; S12.5 + AT: n = 4;
  S25 + AT: n = 4 mice. Two-way ANOVA with Dunnett post-hoc correction for multiple
  comparisons. Data are presented as mean values +/- SEM. B. Representative images
  of CD3 immunostaining of the mouse aortic root done across the following treatments:
  WD, AT, S 12.5 and AT + S 12.5. (4X magnification). C. Bar graphs with overlapping
  dots of CD3+ area quantification. P values were determined by one-way ANOVA with
  Tukey’s post hoc test across all groups. WD: n = 5; AT: n = 5; S12.5: n = 5; S12.5 + AT:
  n = 6 mice. Data are presented as mean values +/- SD. D. CyTOF analysis of circulating
  immune cell from available whole blood from mice samples at 16 weeks. Major immune
  cell populations in blood (neutrophils, CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, monocytes, eosinophils
  and dendritic cells (DCs) were analyzed across the following treatments: WD, AT,
  S 12.5 and AT + S 12.5. Box plots and whiskers showing the mean and range (min to
  max). P values were determined by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test across
  all groups. n = 4 mice/group. E. GO Molecular functions and signaling pathway analysis
  of the top 100 DEGs upregulated in the WD group. (n = 5 mice) The combined score
  (c) was calculated from the p-value obtained using Fisher’s exact test. F. GO Molecular
  functions and signaling pathway analysis of the top 100 DEGs upregulated in the
  atorvastatin group, (n = 3 mice). The combined score (c) was calculated from the
  p-value obtained using Fisher’s exact test. G. GO Molecular functions and signaling
  pathway analysis of the top 100 DEGs upregulated in the saracatinib+atorvastatin
  group, n = 4 mice. The combined score (c) was calculated from the p-value obtained
  using Fisher’s exact test.'
