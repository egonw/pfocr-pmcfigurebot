caption: Expression of oxidative stress-related proteins. (A)-(E) Western blotting
  assays showed that MELNs promoted Nrf2 nuclear translocation and increased HO-1
  expression. **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05 compared to the GlcN (+) hepatocytes. (F)-(J)
  In vivo experiments also showed that the expression level of HO-1 and the ratio
  of Nrf2(N)/Nrf2(C) expression were increased after administration of MELNs. **p < 0.01,
  *p < 0.05 compared to the HFD/STZ mice
