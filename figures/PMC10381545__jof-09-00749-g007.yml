caption: 'Metabolic pathways of acetate and glucose metabolism in U. maydis. The metabolism
  of acetate is indicated in red arrows (glyoxylate cycle and gluconeogenesis), the
  glucose metabolism is shown in blue (glycolysis), and the phosphate pentose pathway
  is shown in green. The numbers inside the circles indicates the enzymes involved
  in the different steps along the pathways. The abbreviations corresponds to (1)
  PEPCK, (2) FBPase, (3) HK, (4) PFK-1, (5) PK, (6) G6PDH, (7) FAS. Figure was created
  with BioRender.com. Agreement number: PG25FVGYFP.'
