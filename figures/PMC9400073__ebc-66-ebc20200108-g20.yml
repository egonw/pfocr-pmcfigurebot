figure_title: Schematic outlining the IL-6 JAK-STAT signalling pathway and regulation
caption: The JAK proteins are constitutively associated with the GP130 receptor. IL-6
  binds IL6RA and GP130, allowing the JAKs to come into close proximality to one another.
  The JAKs are then activated by transphosphorylation, and subsequently phosphorylate
  nearby tyrosine residues including those found on the GP130 receptor tail. The four
  distal phosphotyrosine sites act as docking sites for STATs. Activated STATs then
  translocate to the nucleus where they bind to specific regions on target DNA and
  up-regulate gene transcription. These changes in gene transcription dictate the
  response the cell has to the initial cytokine binding. There are several proteins
  involved in the regulation of JAK-STAT signalling, including the SOCS proteins and
  phosphatases which control ubiquitination and dephosphorylation of the proteins,
  respectively. Additionally, drugs such as JAK and IL-6 inhibitors have been developed
  as therapeutics to block signalling via the JAK-STAT signalling pathway.
