caption: MiR-BART5-5p could promote host cell survival by suppressing mitochondria-dependent
  apoptosis and inducing autophagy. (A) qPCR analysis of ebv-miR-BART5-5p in FARAGE,
  DOHH2, SUDHL-2 and KIS-1. (B) Western blot analysis of LMP1, PUMA-α, PUMA-β, p53
  and p21 proteins in FARAGE, DOHH2, SUDHL-2 and KIS-1. (C) Computational predictions
  of ebv-miR-BART5-5p target sites in PUMA 3′UTR. (D) The results of dual-luciferase
  reporter assay in 293T cells showed that miR-BART5-5p had decreased the luciferase
  activity of PUMA wild-type reporter plasmid significantly at 24 h (P < 0.0001) and
  48 h (P = 0.0058) but not PUMA mutant. (E) Western blot analysis of PUMA-α and PUMA-β
  proteins in FARAGE, DOHH2, SUDHL-2 and KIS-1 after transfection of miR-BART5-5p
  inhibitor or mimic. (F) CCK8 assay in FARAGE, DOHH2, SUDHL-2 and KIS-1 after transfection
  of miR-BART5-5p inhibitor or mimic. (G) Cell cycle analysis in FARAGE, DOHH2, SUDHL-2
  and KIS-1 after transfection of miR-BART5-5p inhibitor or mimic. (H) Western blot
  analysis of PUMA-α, PUMA-β, p53, p-p53, cleaved PARP, p21 and Bcl-2 proteins in
  cells treated with doxorubicin of FARAGE, DOHH2, SUDHL-2 and KIS-1 after transfection
  of miR-BART5-5p inhibitor or mimic. (I) Western blot analysis of cytoplasmic p53
  in FARAGE, DOHH2, SUDHL-2 and KIS-1 after transfection of miR-BART5-5p inhibitor
  or mimic. (J) Western blot analysis of PUMA-α, PUMA-β, p53 and cleaved PARP in cells
  treated with doxorubicin and/or pifithrin-α of FARAGE, DOHH2, SUDHL-2 and KIS-1
  after transfection of miR-BART5-5p inhibitor or mimics. (K) Immunofluorescence analysis
  of the nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution of p53 in FARAGE and SUDHL-2 after transfection
  of miR-BART5-5p inhibitor or mimics. (L) Apoptosis assay in cells treated with doxorubicin
  and/or CQ of FARAGE, DOHH2, SUDHL-2 and KIS-1 after transfection of miR-BART5-5p
  inhibitor or mimic. (M) Immunofluorescence analysis of LC3 in FARAGE and SUDHL-2
  after transfection of miR-BART5-5p inhibitor or mimics. CP, cleaved PARP; Dox, doxorubicin;
  MUT, mutant; NC, negative control; PC, positive control; PFT, pifithrin-α; WT, wild-type.
  For A and D, mean and SEM values from n = 3 replicates are ∗, P < 0.05; ∗∗, P < 0.01;
  ∗∗∗, P < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗, P < 0.0001; ns, non-significant using one way Anova with multiple
  comparison test and two-tailed paired Student t test respectively.
