caption: Mitochondrial morphodynamics affects DNA damage repair signaling. (A) MFN1-depleted
  cells were treated with Phleo for 2 h. U2OS cells were stained with anti-BRCA1 (green),
  Mitotracker (red) and DAPI (blue). Bar graph represents quantification of >10 foci
  of BRCA1. Cells were counted in three independent experiments (shCtrl n = 245 and
  shMFN1 n = 312). ***P < 0.001 vs control shRNA by two-sided unpaired Student's t-test.
  Scale bar, 10 μm. (B) MFN1-depleted U2OS cells were treated with Phleo for 2 h and
  immunostained with anti-53BP1 antibody. The percentage of >10 foci of 53BP1 per
  cell was shown in three dependent experiments (shCtrl n = 352 and shMFN1 n = 279).
  ***P < 0.001 vers control shRNA by two-sided unpaired Student's t-test. scale bars,
  10 μm. (C) U2OS HR reporter cells were transfected with indicated siRNAs. After
  24h, I-Sce1 nuclease-expressing vector was transfected into reporter cells. After
  48 h, GFP-positive cells were calculated by FACS. An ATM inhibitor (ATMi) was used
  as a HR positive control. Bars represent mean ± SEM from three independent experiments.
  *** P < 0.001 versus control shRNA by two-sided unpaired Student's t-test. (D) U2OS
  NHEJ reporter cells were transfected with MFN1, Sab and JNK1 siRNA or shOPA1. Twenty-four
  hours after transfection, I-Sce1 nuclease-expressing vector was transfected into
  reporter cells. After 48 h, the number of FACS-sorted GFP-positive cells indicate
  repair efficiency and is normalized to mock control. An ATM inhibitor (ATMs) was
  used as an HR/ NHEJ positive control. Bars represent mean ± SEM from three independent
  experiments. **P < 0.005, *** P < 0.001 versus control shRNA by two-sided unpaired
  Student's t-test. (E) H2O2-induced DDR was examined by Alkaline comet assays. The
  control or MFN1-depleted U2OS cells were subjected to H2O2 (500 μM) treatment for
  20 min. Cells were released with fresh medium for 4 h after exposure of DNA damage
  and proceeded to comet assay. scale bars, 10 μm. (F) Average tail moments of cells
  are shown in the comet assay. Bars represent mean ± SEM from three independent experiments.
  *P < 0.05 versus control shRNA by two-sided unpaired Student's t-test.
