caption: 'Protein–protein associations of variant protein coding sequences between
  the Ossabaw minipig and Göttingen minipig strains: The Search Tool for the Retrieval
  of Interacting Genes (STRING) identified networks for the topic mitochondrion, vitamin
  B12 metabolism, inflammation including the janus kinase (JAK)—signal transducer
  and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, fat metabolism, mineralisation and
  ribosome. We assigned the cluster designation with reference of the functional enrichments
  in the STRING network analysis. The matching proteins within the respective networks
  are listed in the supplemental excel data sheet “STRING–protein–protein associations”
  column I “matching proteins in your network (labels)”'
article_title: Non-responsiveness to cardioprotection by ischaemic preconditioning
  in Ossabaw minipigs with genetic predisposition to, but without the phenotype of
  the metabolic syndrome.
