caption: 'Pediatric neural tumors also exhibit sex and gender - skewed gene expression.
  (A) Ridge plots for neuroblastoma and the three most common malignant brain tumors
  of childhood (489 total, 259 M, 230 F., M: F IRR = 1.13:1) demonstrating sex -skewed
  TI population distributions, with vertical lines indicating the 5%, 25%, 75% and
  95% quantiles, respectively. (B)(C) Cancer Hallmark Pathway analysis of those genes
  that exerted the greatest effects on the male and female poles for each cancer.
  A predominant polarization pattern is identified with inflammatory/immunity pathways
  associated with the female pole (red circles) and cell cycle regulatory pathways
  associated with the male pole (blue circles). Gene counts (count) are symbolized
  by the size of the circles and False Discovery Rates (FDR) by the saturation of
  the fill as indicated in the legends'

  precision cancer treatments.
