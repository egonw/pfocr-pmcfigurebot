caption: 'Leafminer herbivory effects on the expression of terpene biosynthetic genes
  in leaves and roots. (a) Simplified scheme displaying the biosynthesis pathway of
  β‐caryophyllene and Eucalyptol (1,8‐cineole) in tomato (Zhou & Pichersky, ). Terpene
  precursors are synthesised by the cytosolic mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway and the
  plastidic methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. Normalised transcript levels
  (mean ± SEM, n = 4–5) of terpene metabolism‐related genes in (b) leaves and (c)
  roots of Liriomyza trifolii‐infested and noninfested wild‐type (wt) and def‐1 tomato
  (Solanum lycopersicum) plants at 24 d after infestation. Transcript abundances were
  determined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT‐PCR)
  and normalised to Ubiquitin transcript levels. Shaded graphs indicate statistically
  significant effects of plant genotype (G), herbivory (H) and/or their interaction
  (G × H) determined by two‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01;
  ***, P < 0.001). Different letters indicate significant differences among groups
  determined by estimated marginal means (EMMeans) post hoc test with multiple comparison
  adjustments (Tukey’s honest significant difference (HSD)) (P ≤ 0.05). Abbreviations
  for precursors and genes: CPT1, cis‐prenyltransferase 1; DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate;
  FPPS1, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase 1; GGPPS1, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase
  1; GGPPS3, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase 3; GPP, geranyl diphosphate; IPP,
  isopentenyl diphosphate; NPP, neryl‐diphosphate; SSU1, small subunit of geranyl
  diphosphate synthase 1; TPS8, terpene synthase 8; TPS12, terpene synthase 12. Dashed
  arrow indicates the putative route.'
