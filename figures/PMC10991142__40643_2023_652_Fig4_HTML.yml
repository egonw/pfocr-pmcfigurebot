caption: Optimization of MCR for the increased 3-HP accumulation. A Promoter optimization
  strategy for the expression of MCR. B 3-HP production in engineered yeasts from
  glucose by expression of MCR-C and MCR-N under control by different promoter combinations.
  C The competing synthetic pathway of 3-HP and fatty acid. Intracellular fatty acid
  synthesis competes with the 3-HP sub-pathway for catalyzing malonyl-CoA. D 3-HP
  production in engineered yeasts from glucose by expression of MCR using different
  plasmids, including 2 μ-based plasmid pSC-HIS-PH, 2 μ-based plasmid pSC-URA-PH,
  and ultrahigh copy number plasmid pUGG-PH. E The yield of the reporter mesaconate
  from glucose. M201, strain M2 harboring the plasmid pSC-HIS-MCR for overexpressing
  MCR; M203, strain M2 harboring the plasmid pUGG-PH for overexpressing MCR. Strains
  were cultured with SC-dropout medium with 0.1% glyoxylate
article_title: Exploiting a heterologous construction of the 3-hydroxypropionic acid
  carbon fixation pathway with mesaconate as an indicator in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
