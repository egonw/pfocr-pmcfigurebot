caption: 'Flavonoids exerting antidiabetic activity via different mechanistic pathways:
  Flavonoids increase insulin secretion and improve β-cell function via the PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathway; increase GLUT-4 translocation through AMPK activation to increase
  glucose uptake in adipose tissues and skeletal muscles; activate PPAR-γ expression
  to decrease insulin resistance; activate cAMP/PKA pathway to reduce blood glucose
  levels and improve glucose tolerance; increase glutathione peroxidase activity to
  reduce HbA1c levels; decrease G-6-Pase, PEPCK, glycogen phosphorylase, fructose
  1,6-biphosphatase and DPP-IV activity in liver to decrease gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis,
  and glycoslysis; inhibit SGLT pathway in kidney to decrease renal glucose reabsorption;
  inhibit GLUT-2, α-amylase and α-glucosidase activity to decrease glucose absorption
  in the small intestine.'
