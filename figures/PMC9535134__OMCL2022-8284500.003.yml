caption: 'Identification and enrichment analysis of genes associated with high GOLM1
  expression. (a) DEGs in GOLM1-knocked down (KD) MHCC97H cells and control MHCC97H
  cells. (b) DEGs between TCGA and RNA sequencing data. (c, d) GO and KEGG enrichment
  analyses of 400 specific DEGs associated with GOLM1 overexpression in HCC. (e) KEGG
  pathway annotations of the VEGF signaling pathway. Green indicates low expression,
  and red indicates high expression. DEGs: differentially expressed genes; GO: Gene
  Ontology; VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor.'
