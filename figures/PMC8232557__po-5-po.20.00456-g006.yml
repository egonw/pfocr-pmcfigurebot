caption: Frequencies and interactions of somatic genetic mutations in 10 selected
  signaling pathways (n = 499). Genetic alterations identified by the MSK-IMPACT assay
  were filtered by OncoKB to exclude mutations and copy number alterations of unknown
  significance as well as germline mutations. (A) Notch pathway. (B) WNT pathway.
  (C) TGF-Î² pathway. (D) TP53 pathway. (E) Hippo pathway. (F) MYC pathway. (G) PI3K
  pathway. (H) RAS pathway. (I) NRF2 pathway. (J) Cell cycle pathway.
