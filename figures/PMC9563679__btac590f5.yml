caption: Selected visualization summaries from the HTML report. The ‘COVID’ dataset
  containing mild and severe COVID-19 patients was used to show a subset of visualization
  summaries from the association analysis report. (a) Composition plot of the ‘cell
  type proportion raw’ features in mild and severe patients. (b) Enriched pathways
  of the top 200 features associated with the plasmoblasts of severe patients. Pathway
  enrichment in the left plot was calculated based on features from ‘cell type specific
  mean expression’. Pathway enrichment in the right plot was calculated based on features
  from ‘cell type specific mean proportion’. Similar pathway terms were grouped by
  hierarchical clustering. (c) Heatmap shows the difference in the number of CCI features
  between mild and severe patients. Positive number indicates more interactions in
  the mild patients and negative number indicates more interactions in the severe
  patients
