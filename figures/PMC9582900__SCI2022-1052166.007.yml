caption: 'hUC-MSC-secreted Chi3l1 represses CD4 differentiation to Th17 cells by inhibiting
  STAT3 activation. (a) Reactome pathway showing that Chi3l1 is associated with interleukin-6
  family signaling. (b) Gene Ontology showing that Chi3l1 is associated with lymphocyte
  differentiation. (c) STRING interaction network displaying that Chi3l1 interacts
  with STAT3. (d–f) CD4+ T cells (5 × 105) obtained from the spleen of C57BL/6J mice
  were differentiated into Th17 cells in 96-well plates in the presence or absence
  of hUC-MSCs, sh-NC-MSCs, sh-Chi3l1-MSCs, or sh-Chi3l1-MSCs (5 × 103) plus Stattic
  (20 μM) at a CD4+ T/hUC-MSC ratio of 100 : 1 for 72 hours. (e) The proportion of
  Th17 cells was analyzed using flow cytometry. (d) The percentage of Th17-positive
  cells was detected by flow cytometry (one-way ANOVA and Tukey''s multiple comparison
  test, ∗P < 0.05, three independent experiments). (f) Protein expression level of
  p-STAT3 measured by western blot. STAT3: signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3; sh-NC: sh-NC-MSCs; sh-Chi3l1: sh-Chi3l1-MSCs. Stattic: p-STAT3 inhibitor.'
