figure_title: Schematic summary of the process through which SS2 penetrates the tracheal
  epithelial barrier
caption: Atl first promotes the adhesion of SS2 to the STEC surface. Then, Atl interacts
  with vimentin on the surface of STECs. The reassembly of vimentin activates MLCK
  signaling. Subsequently, phosphorylated MLC induces the redistribution of TJs and
  disruption of the tracheal epithelial barrier. Finally, SS2 penetrates the barrier
  from the paracellular pathway.
