caption: 'Overexpression of SIRT6 induces ferroptosis and inhibits glycolysis in pancreatic
  cancer cells. (A and B) After transfection with si-SIRT6 (#1, #2 and #3), the expression
  of SIRT6 in PANC-1 cells was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR
  and western blotting. (C) The viability of PANC-1 cells was determined by Cell Counting
  Kit-8 assay. (D) Fe2+ content was evaluated by Fe2+ detection kit. (E) PANC-1 cells
  transfected with si-SIRT6 were treated with erastin or ferrostatin-1, and then the
  Fe2+ content was evaluated by Fe2+ detection kit. (F) ROS level was detected by
  DCFH-DA method. (G) GPX4 and SLC7A11 expression levels were assessed by western
  blot analysis. (H-J) Glucose consumption, lactic acid and ATP production were evaluated
  by the corresponding kits. (K) HK2 and LDHA expression levels were detected by western
  blotting. *P<0.05 vs. control and si-NC group; **P<0.01 vs. control and si-NC group
  and #P<0.05 vs. SIRT6 group. SIRT6, sirtuin6; si-, small interfering; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; GPX4, glutathione peroxidase 4; HK, hexokinase; LDHA, lactate dehydrogenase
