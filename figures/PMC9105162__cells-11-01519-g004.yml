caption: 'OpHcd1 and OpHcd2 localise to the SPB in the mother cell body during anaphase.
  (a) Cell cycle dependent localisation of OpHcd1-GFP. OpHCD1-GFP MPS3-mRFP cells
  (HPH1605) were grown in YPDS medium at 30 °C. Mps3-mRFP is an SPB marker. Shown
  are deconvolved and projected GFP and RFP images and merged brightfield, GFP, and
  RFP images. Yellow arrowhead indicates Hcd1-GFP signal. Meta: metaphase. Ana: anaphase.
  Scale bar, 2 µm. (b) Cell cycle dependent localisation of OpHcd2-GFP. OpHCD2-GFP
  MPS3-mRFP cells (HPH1608) were grown in YPDS medium at 30 °C. Mps3-mRFP is an SPB
  marker. Shown are deconvolved and projected GFP and RFP images and merged brightfield,
  GFP, and RFP images. Yellow arrowhead indicates Hcd2-GFP signal. Meta: metaphase.
  Ana: anaphase. Scale bar, 2 µm. (c) Time-lapse microscopy of OpHCD1-GFP MPS3-mRFP
  cells (HPH1605). Images were taken every 90 sec. RFP image was only captured before
  the start of the time-lapse series. The cell entered into anaphase before the 9
  min timepoint judged by the position of the Hcd1-GFP dot. The Hcd1-GFP signal returned
  to the cell centre at the 22.5 timepoint, suggesting that mitotic exit occurred
  between the 21 min and the 22.5 min timepoints. Yellow arrowheads indicate the OpHcd1-GFP
  signal at the mSPB. Shown are deconvolved and projected images. Scale bar, 2 µm.
  (d) Time-lapse microscopy of OpHCD2-GFP MPS3-mRFP cells (HPH1608). Images were taken
  every 90 sec. RFP image was only captured before the start of the time-lapse series.
  The cell entered into anaphase before the 9 min timepoint as judged by the position
  of the Hcd2-GFP dot. Yellow arrowheads indicate the OpHcd2-GFP signal at the mSPB.
  Shown are deconvolved and projected images. Scale bar, 2 µm.'
