caption: Identification of the POCD model. Assessment of neurobehavioral abilities
  of SMA surgery mice (n = 6 per group). (A) Total distance travelled in the open
  field test. (B) Learning index (transfer latency time to enter the closed arm during
  the training period—transfer latency time to enter the closed arm during the test
  period) in the elevated plus maze test. (C) Discrimination time rate for novel objects
  in the test phase of the novel objective recognition test. The level of inflammatory
  cytokines and NLRP3 inflammasome component in SMA surgery mice. (D) IL-1β, IL-18,
  and TNF-α and (E) NLRP3, ASC, and caspasei-1 in the hippocampus. Sham, Sham control
  group; SMA, Superior mesenchymal artery surgery group; * p < 0.05 compared to the
  sham.
