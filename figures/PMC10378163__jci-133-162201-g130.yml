figure_title: Ruxolitinib enhances BMSC function in aGVHD mice
caption: '(A) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment of
  JAK/STAT signaling in BMSCs isolated from BMT and aGVHD mice; n = 30 per group.
  NES, normalized enrichment score. (B–D) Survival curve (B), body weight (C), and
  aGVHD score (D) for aGVHD mice after vehicle or ruxolitinib treatment (30 mg/kg
  in solvent, oral administration, twice a day); n = 6 per group. (E) Alterations
  of LepR+ BMSC frequency after ruxolitinib treatment; n = 4 per group. (F) Osteogenic
  differentiation assay of BMSCs from ruxolitinib- or vehicle-treated aGVHD mice;
  n = 3 independent replicates. Scale bars: 200 μm. **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001, by
  log-rank test (B), 1-way ANOVA followed by unpaired, 2-tailed t test (C and D),
  and unpaired, 2-tailed t test (E).'
