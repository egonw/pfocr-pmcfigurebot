caption: Si-hsa_circ_000166 can inhibit the progression of diabetic renal fibrosis.
  We used qRT-PCR to detect the expression levels of (a) collagen IV, (b) TGF-β1,
  (c) ACE, (d) AT1, and (e) VEGF in the kidney tissues of mice in each group. (f)
  The expression levels of the above factors were quantitatively analyzed by western
  blot. The data are average ± standard (n = 10 per group). ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01,
  and ∗∗∗p < 0.001.
