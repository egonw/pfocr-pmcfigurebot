caption: Altered gene transcription in response to AA exposure in cerebral organoids.
  (A) Table providing an overview of the number of significantly differentially expressed
  genes after acute, prolonged, and long-term AA exposure. (B) Venn diagram showing
  the overlap between significantly differentially expressed genes after acute, prolonged,
  and long-term AA exposure. (C) Heatmap representations of row-scaled DESeq2 vst
  transformed and adjusted z-scores of the most significantly (p-adj) differentially
  expressed genes (10 up/downregulated) for acute, prolonged, and long-term AA exposure.
  (D) Cell type analysis of differentially expressed genes after AA exposure at the
  3 different time points, showing the overlap between cell-type-specific gene lists
  and the differentially regulated genes determined by Fisher’s exact test. At the
  acute time point, no significant cell-type enrichment was found. (E) Ingenuity pathway
  analysis (IPA) of differentially expressed genes after AA exposure of organoids
  at the different time points, showing only significant terms (the x-axis shows the
  significance (−log (p-value)). No significant enrichment of canonical pathways was
  found for differentially expressed genes at the acute time point.
