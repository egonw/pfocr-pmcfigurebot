caption: CSFV infection Up-regulates HSP90AA1 expression. (A) HSP90AA1 mRNA relative
  levels in PK-15 and 3D4/2 cells was analyzed by qRT-PCR; (B) Western blot showing
  HSP90AA1 protein expression and the relative protein levels of HSP90AA1 in PK-15
  and 3D4/2 cells were estimated by histograms representing density readings of the
  gel bands with Image J, and the ratios were calculated relative to Tubulin control.
  (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ****p < 0.0001 calculated using two-way ANOVA, ns, not
  significant).
article_title: HSP90AA1 interacts with CSFV NS5A protein and regulates CSFV replication
  via the JAK/STAT and NF-κB signaling pathway.
