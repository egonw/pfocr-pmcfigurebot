caption: circ_0006174 is upregulated in CRC tissues and cell lines. (A) Volcano map
  was used to evaluate the circRNAs that were markedly upregulated and downregulated
  in the CRC tissue in the GEO dataset (GSE138589). (B) Heat map was adopted to show
  the top eight circRNAs that were markedly upregulated in CRC. (C) RT-qPCR was used
  to detect circ_0006174 expression in 68 pairs of CRC tissues and paracancerous non-tumor
  tissues. (D) RT-qPCR was used to analyze circ_0006174 expression in normal human
  colonic epithelial cell line and CRC cell lines (HCT116, SW620, SW480 and HT29).
  (E) Diagram of the circular structure of circ_0006174. *P<0.05; ***P<0.001. CRC,
  colorectal cancer; circRNAs, circular RNA; GEO, Gene Expression Omnibus; RT-qPCR,
  reverse transcription-quantitative PCR.
