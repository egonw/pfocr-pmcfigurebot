caption: 'Mex3a deletion suppresses WNT signaling activity. A, Heatmap depicting the
  expression profiles of stemness related genes and differentiation related genes
  in transcriptome profiles of wild-type (WT) and KO mice. B, KEGG pathway analysis
  of downregulated genes in transcriptome profiles from WT and KO mice. n = 4 biological
  replicates. C, Heatmap showing altered WNT-related genes in WT and KO mice. D, qRT-PCR
  analysis validates altered WNT-related genes in WT and KO mice. n = 3. E, Gene set
  enrichment analysis (GSEA) of WNT signaling pathway genes in transcriptome profiles
  of WT and KO mice. F, Western blotting for WNT target genes c-Myc, Cyclin D1, Tcf-1,
  LBH and Axin2 in intestinal crypts from WT and KO mice. α-Tubulin was used as a
  loading control. G, Representative immunohistochemical images of non-p-β-catenin
  in ileum from WT and KO mice. Arrowheads point to non-p-nuclei. Numbers of nuclear
  β-catenin+ cells per crypt were quantified. WT, n = 245 crypts from 3 mice; KO,
  n = 253 crypts from 3 mice. Scale bar: 25 μm. H, Luciferase activity of TOPflash
  versus FOPflash in HCT116 cells treated with pcDNA3.1 empty vector and MEX3A plasmids.
  n = 3. I, Immunohistochemistry for non-p-β-catenin in AOM-DSS colon tumors from
  control (Ctrl) and cKO mice. n = 7. Scale bar: 25 μm. J, qRT-PCR analysis of WNT
  target genes in AOM-DSS tumors from Ctrl and cKO mice. n = 3. K, Western blotting
  for Cyclin D1, c-Myc, Axin2 and non-p-β-catenin in AOM-DSS tumors from Ctrl and
  cKO mice. α-Tubulin was used as a loading control. L, KEGG pathway analysis of genes
  positively correlated with MEX3A in COAD. M, Gene set enrichment analysis of WNT
  signaling pathway in genes positively correlated with MEX3A in COAD. Data are presented
  as the mean ± SD. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.'
