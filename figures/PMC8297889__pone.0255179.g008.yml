figure_title: Proposed schematic presentation of the COL17 effect on the AKT/mTOR
  signaling pathway
caption: The AKT/mTOR signaling pathway promotes cell proliferation and growth by
  phosphorylation of its effector proteins. The phosphorylated p70S6K subsequently
  phosphorylates S6 ribosomal protein to induce ribosome synthesis. During inactive
  state, eIF4E binds to its inhibitory partner 4EBP1. The phosphorylated 4EBP1 releases
  the binding to eIF4E making it active and promote the protein translation. In breast
  cancer tissues, COL17 has been found to be depleted. The overexpression of COL17
  deactivates the AKT/mTOR pathway by dephosphorylation of AKT, mTOR, p70S6K, and
  4EBP1 leading to inhibition of cell growth and proliferation. The binding partners
  and effector molecules of COL17 which directly control the AKT/mTOR pathway in breast
  cancer are unknown and need to be further clarified.
