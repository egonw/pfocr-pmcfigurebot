caption: Arsenic-induced activation of AMPK/mTOR/P70S6K signaling pathway. The expression
  of AMPK/mTOR/p-P70S6K pathway members in WT and Ptpn11D61G/+ MEFs (A) and tumor
  tissue from nude mouse xenografts (C) with or without arsenic treatment were detected
  by western blot. (B, D) Relative quantitative analysis of protein expression in
  (A and C). *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.
article_title: Arsenic exposure increases susceptibility to Ptpn11-induced malignancy
  in mouse embryonic fibroblasts through mitochondrial hypermetabolism.
