caption: Overexpression of SEC61G promotes proliferation and invasion of CC cells
  in vitro. (a) SiHa cells were transfected with a plasmid overexpressing SEC61G,
  and the transfection efficiency of SEC61G was detected. (b) EdU proliferation assay.
  (c) Transwell detection of invasive ability of CC cells. After 48 h, crystal violet
  staining was performed and counted. (d) Detection of E-cadherin expression. (e)
  Vimentin expression detection. ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. mock group.
