caption: 'The role of CPSF7 in the malignant characteristics of LUAD cells: (a) mRNA
  expression of CPSF7 was measured using RT-qPCR. (b) Protein expression of CPSF7
  was measured by Western blotting. (c) Cell viability was measured by cell counting
  kit (CCK-8) assay. (d) Colony number was detected by colony formation assay. (e)
  Cell migration rate was detected by wound healing assay (scale bar = 50 µm). (f)
  Invasion rate was detected by Transwell assay (scale bar = 50 µm). A549 cells were
  stably transfected with si-CPSF7 or oe-CPSF7. Each experiment was repeated three
  times (n = 3). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 vs Control; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 vs si-NC
  + oe-NC.'
article_title: Silencing of CPSF7 inhibits the proliferation, migration, and invasion
  of lung adenocarcinoma cells by blocking the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
