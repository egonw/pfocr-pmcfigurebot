caption: 'Modulation of EMT and stemness processes by SALL4 overexpression in HER2+
  cells. (A–D) The expression of EMT-related markers and MYC was assessed by RT-qPCR
  and Western blot in both BT474 and SKBR3 cell lines with overexpression of SALL4.
  (E–H) mRNA and protein expression analysis of stemness markers by RT-qPCR and Western
  blot after upregulating SALL4 expression in BT474 and SKBR3. GAPDH expression was
  used as an internal control in both RT-qPCR and Western blot. Student’s t-test compared
  the results. * p-value ≤ 0.05 and ** p-value ≤ 0.01, *** p-value ≤ 0.001 and ****
  p-value ≤ 0.0001. EV: Empty Vector: OE: Overexpression of SALL4. n.s: not significant.'
