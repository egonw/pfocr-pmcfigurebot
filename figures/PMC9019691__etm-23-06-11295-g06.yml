caption: Expression levels of components of the inflammatory response and the NF-κB
  pathway in mouse synovial fibroblasts were verified using reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR and western blotting. (A) mRNA expression levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, NLRP3 and
  IκBα after treatment with LPS for 24 and 48 h. (B) Representative western blotting
  images and (C) semi-quantification of the protein expression levels of TNF-α, IL-1β,
  NLRP3 and IκBα. Data are presented as the mean ± SD; *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001,
  ****P<0.0001 vs. Control. LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NLRP3, NLR family pyrin domain
  containing 3.
