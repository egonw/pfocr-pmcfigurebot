caption: Neuroprotective effect of 24-h incubation of hippocampal cells with MSC-EV
  in OGD model. (A) Set of Ca2+ signals from neurons during 40-min OGD in the control
  (black curves) and after 24h incubation with MSC-EV (red curves). (B) Set of Ca2+
  signals from astrocytes during 40-min OGD in the control (black curves) and after
  24h incubation with MSC-EV (red curves). Ca2+ signals from single cells are represented
  using the same cell culture. (C) Images of the hippocampal cell culture in transmitted
  light (BF) and the propidium iodide fluorescence before (PI) and after 40-min OGD
  (PI+OGD) are given. The white dots represent the nuclei of necrotic cells stained
  by PI. (D) The percentage of PI-stained (necrotic) hippocampal cells before and
  after OGD in the control group and in cells subjected to 24 h incubation with MSC-EV.
  (E) The effect of MSC-EV on the rate of increase in [Ca2+]i in the second phase
  of the ischemic response of neurons (black columns) and astrocytes (blue columns).
  (F, G) The area under the curve in the second phase of the ischemic response of
  neurons (F) and astrocytes (G) in the control group and in cells exposed to MSC-EV,
  reflecting the calcium load of the cells. The differences are statistically significant
  at *p≤0.05; ** p ≤ 0.01 and ***p ≤ 0.001. Short-term applications of 35 mM KCl and
  10 µM ATP were used to detect neurons and astrocytes, respectively. Shown are the
  means ± SEM for the 2 technical replicates per 3 independent cell cultures. More
  than 1000 cells were analyzed to build diagrams on panels D and E.
