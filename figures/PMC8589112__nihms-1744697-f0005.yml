figure_title: N-linked glycans are essential mediators of neuroinflammation
caption: Neuroinflammation is one of the major drivers of neurogenerative diseases.
  Glial cells such as astrocytes and microglia contribute to this process by producing
  pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines to recruit and mount an immune response. They
  also generate reactive oxygen species and activate phagocytosis to clear cellular
  debris. Pro-inflammatory triggers activate signaling cascades such as NFκB, MAPK,
  and JAK/STAT pathways that initiate cytokine, chemokine, and nitric oxide synthase
  (iNOS) production in astrocytes. N-linked glycosylation is a modifier of NFκB, MAPK,
  JAK/STAT pathway components as well as participates in the production, trafficking,
  and interaction of cytokines/chemokines/iNOS. Released cytokines and chemokines
  can recruit and activate microglia by binding to their corresponding cell surface
  receptors. Cytokine ligand and receptor binding (such as IL-6 and IFN-γ) require
  N-linked glycosylation for the signaling transduction events that lead to expression
  of iNOS, intracellular release of Ca2+, NO, H2O2, cathepsin, and the action of phagocytosis.
  Collectively, N-linked glycans are an integral component of these neuroinflammatory
  pathways, especially in driving the release of pro-apoptotic factors that lead to
  neuronal cell death.
