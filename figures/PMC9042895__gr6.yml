caption: 'GADD45G is highly expressed during neurodevelopment, especially in the early
  fetal human brain(A–E) In the bar charts, the GADD45G (A), TUBB (B), DCX (C), GLUL
  (D), and SLC1A2 (E) expression levels (RPKM values) were compared among the following
  generations: fetuses and patients aged 0 to 10 years, 10 to 20 years, 20 to 30 years,
  and 30 to 40 years. In the box charts, fetuses were stratified by postconceptional
  weeks (pcw), and each dot represents each sample’s detailed expression (RPKM value)
  of the gene.Bulk RNA-seq data from human brains were obtained from the BrainSpan
  Atlas of the Developing Human Brain (http://www.brainspan.org). Statistical analyses
  were performed with one-way ANOVA followed by Steel-Dwass post hoc tests. The values
  in the bar graphs represent the means ± SEs. ∗∗∗p < 0.001.'

  by promoting microtubule polymerization.
