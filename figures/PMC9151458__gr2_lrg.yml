caption: Potential application of CD24-Fc in LGG and KIRC. (A) Annotation refinement
  of cell subsets within lineages using gene expression data from the NCBI GEO database
  with accession number GSE158055. The bottom panel displayed the CD24 expression
  of several cell lineages. (B) The correlation between CD24 and the inflammation
  score in various types of cancer. (C) CD24-related PPI network assembled using StringDB.
  (D) KEGG pathway enrichment of the network. (E) Differences in the TIDE score between
  CD24-high and CD24-low groups in LGG and KIRC respectively.
