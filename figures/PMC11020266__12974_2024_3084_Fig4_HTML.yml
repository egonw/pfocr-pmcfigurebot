caption: NSA or Mdivi-1 reversed mitochondrial abnormalities in the hippocampus of
  SAE mice. A Representative images of mitochondria ultrastructure surrounding the
  nuclei, the black arrow showed the interruptions of continuity of mitochondrial
  membrane. B Representative images of mitochondria ultrastructure in the hippocampal
  CA1 region. The asterisks showed the abnormal mitochondria. C Quantification of
  the abnormal mitochondria. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM (n = 3 mice/group,
  three images per mouse). Magnification 10,000 ×. Scale bar = 1 μm. D ROS levels
  in the hippocampus. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM (n = 4–5 mice/group). *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 versus the indicated groups
