figure_title: GO term and KEGG pathway enrichments for the UPL3-associated ubiquitin
  conjugates (|FC| > 1.2, P-value < 0.05)
caption: (A) GO term enrichment in categories of molecular functions of UPL3-associated
  ubiquitin conjugates. (B) Bubble plots showing the KEGG pathway of UPL3-associated
  ubiquitin conjugate differentially ubiquitin conjugates. (C) The UPL3-regulated
  ubiquitin conjugates of the upl3/WT mapped in the carbon fixation pathway. (D) The
  UPL3-ubiquitinated conjugates of the upl3/WT mapped in cysteine and methionine metabolism
  pathway. (E) Distribution of UPL3-associated differentially ubiquitin conjugates
  associated with cellular components. (F) Subcellular localization of UPL3 in the
  nucleus of Arabidopsis leaves transiently expressing a C-terminal GFP fusion. The
  GFP-alone expressing leaves sample is used as the control. The nucleus is counter-stained
  with DAPI. Bars = 20 Î¼m.
