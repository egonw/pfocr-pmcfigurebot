caption: RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. (a) The volcano plot showing
  mRNAs with differential expression between the two groups. Red and blue plots represent
  up- and downregulated genes, respectively. (b) The enriched GO annotation for DEGs
  between MG-63-EID3 cells and MG-63-Vector cells. (c) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
  for DEGs between MG-63-EID3 cells and MG-63-Vector cells. (d) Profiling of differentially
  expressed PI3K-AKT and MAPK signaling pathway-related genes. (e) The overlapping
  genes differentially expressed between the two groups of cells. (f) PCR analysis
  of the genes of PI3K-AKT and MAPK pathways from the overlapping genes described
  in (e).
