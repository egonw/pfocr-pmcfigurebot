caption: MapMan analysis based “metabolic overview map” of DEGs in three groups. (A)
  Schematic diagram of metabolic overview categories. The small heatmap in each section
  of the diagram shows the DEGs mapped to the pathway and a small square indicates
  a transcript. Red, orange, and yellow indicate upregulated genes in each group;
  blue, light sea green, and green mean downregulated genes in each group. (B,C) DEGs
  related to (B) cell wall and (C) secondary metabolism. Heatmaps of DEGs were drawn
  using the log2 (FC) value obtained from the pairwise comparison of samples. Red
  and blue indicate upregulation and downregulation, respectively.
