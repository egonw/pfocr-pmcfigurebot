caption: ROS-RET results in the redirection of glycolytic intermediates to the pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP) to produce NADPH and nucleotide precursors. A Schematic
  representation of the biological pathways affected by ROS-RET signalling. Metabolites
  significantly altered by ROS are indicated in red boxes. C–D Heat maps of glycolytic,
  PPP and purine biosynthesis metabolites identified in the fly brain in control flies
  and TS flies with (TS + ROT) and without rotenone (TS). NS, not significant, *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. N = 3 in all experiments unless otherwise stated
article_title: Mitochondrial ROS signalling requires uninterrupted electron flow and
  is lost during ageing in flies.
