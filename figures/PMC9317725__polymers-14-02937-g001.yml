caption: Factors and pathways involved in the biosynthesis of poly (γ-glutamic acid)
  (γ-PGA). Herein, the metabolic pathway (in red) of γ-PGA producers has been summarised.
  In red, the energy generation pathways have been shown. Similarly, γ-PGA generation
  intermediates/components have been presented in green. The figure also illustrates
  polymerisation of d- and l-glutamic acid monomers (red and blue dots respectively)
  into a polymeric chain by the enzymatic complex. The physical arrangement of the
  polymer, with varying D/L ratios, in solution has also been summarised. Light blue
  and purple hexagons represent cross-linked NAM and NAG moieties of Gram-positive
  peptidoglycan. GDH—Glutamate dehydrogenase; L-GPA—l-glutamic acid:pyruvate aminotransferase;
  AR—alanine racemase; D-GPA—d-glutamic acid:pyruvate aminotransferase; GLR—glutamate
  racemase.
