caption: Radiotherapy affects the migration and invasion ability of HCT116-R cells.
  (A) The expression of ACY1 in HCT116 and HCT116-R cells was examined by qRT–PCR.
  (B) The expression of ACY1 in HCT116 and HCT116-R cells was examined by Western
  blotting. (C) Wound healing migration assay showing the impact of different doses
  of radiotherapy on HCT116-R cells (24 h). (D) Invasion assay showing the impact
  of different doses of radiotherapy on HCT116-R cells (48 h). All experiments were
  repeated at least three times, and the data are presented as the mean ± SD.
