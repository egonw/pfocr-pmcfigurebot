caption: Genome-wide identification of SlDof1 direct target genes. (A) Venn diagram
  showing the overlap between genes bound by SlDof1 from chromatin immunoprecipitation
  sequencing (ChIP-seq) and genes differentially expressed in SlDof1 RNAi fruit determined
  by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). (B) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
  analysis of SlDof1 target genes. The size of the circle represents the number of
  genes belonging to that KEGG pathway, and the color represents the q value of pathway
  enrichment determined by Fisherâ€™s exact test with Bonferroni correction
