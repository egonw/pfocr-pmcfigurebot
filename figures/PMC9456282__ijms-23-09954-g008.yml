caption: Caffeine maintains basal levels of TGF-β, α-SMA, and profibrogenic mediators
  in hepatic tissue from the NASH model. (A) Representative IHC images of TGF-β and
  α-SMA in the control, HFSCD+CCl4, HFSCD+CCl4+caffeine, and caffeine groups. Scale
  bar = 20 μm. Positive areas for TGF-β (B) and α-SMA (C) are shown in the histogram
  (n = 4). Protein levels of TGF-β (D), α-SMA (E), CTGF (F), desmin (G), and Smad7
  (H) were detected using western blot analysis (n = 3); β-actin was used as a loading
  control. Values are shown as a fold increment in optical density normalized to control
  group values (control = 1). Bars represent the mean ± SEM. (a) p < 0.05 compared
  with the control group; (b) p < 0.05 compared with the HFSCD+CCl4 group.
