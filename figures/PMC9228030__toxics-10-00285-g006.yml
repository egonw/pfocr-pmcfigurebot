caption: 'Rg1 inhibits tight junction disruption associated with interference with
  p38 MAPK signaling in murine intestinal dysfunction caused by LPS. Experimental
  groups including Group 1, control (saline-treated group); Group 2, the model group
  (LPS-alone-treated group); Group 3, the Rg1-treated group (10 mg/kg + LPS); and
  Group 4, the Rg1-treated group (20 mg/kg + LPS). Ileum sections were stained with
  HE for histological assessment. (A) Representative views are shown (original magnification
  × 20); (B) Western blot analyses of tight-junction-related proteins. Western blot
  analyses of tight-junction-related proteins; (C) mRNA level analyses of NLRP3 and
  IL-1β; (D) Western blot analyses of p38 MAPK signaling-related proteins. β-Actin
  was used as an invariant control for equal loading. Blots are representative of
  three independent experiments with densitometry showing the mean ± s.d. * p < 0.05
  versus control and ** p < 0.01 versus control. ## p < 0.01 versus LPS.'
