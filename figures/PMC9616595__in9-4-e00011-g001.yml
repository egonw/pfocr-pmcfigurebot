caption: 'HK mitochondrial dislocation is regulated by different post-translational
  mechanisms which regulate the metabolic flux of glucose. HK1 and 2 contain a mitochondrial
  binding domain that interact with protein located in the outer membrane of mitochondria.
  Its product, G-6P, is subsequently metabolized by different pathways including glycolysis
  and the PPP among others. The balance between these metabolic pathways influences
  different cellular phenotypes including inflammation. Left panel (modified from
  De Jesus et al []), HK1 mitochondrial association is promoted by acetylation at
  K15 and 21. The upregulation of deacetylases like Sirt2 induce the dissociation
  of HK1 which then forms a cytosolic complex with iNOS to inhibit glycolysis at the
  level of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Consequently, the metabolic
  fate of glucose shifts to favor the PPP that in macrophages promote the expression
  of inflammatory cytokines. Right panel: The association of HK2 is not affected by
  deacetylases. Instead, early studies have shown that AKT-dependent phosphorylation
  of T473 promotes its mitochondrial binding. An independent study in cardiomyocytes
  showed that the overexpression of HK2 promotes the PPP [], but the mechanism associated
  with this shift in the metabolic flux of glucose is unknown. Determination of whether
  HK2 or other cytosolic HKs can induce the inhibition of GAPDH in different context
  will be important to understand the level of redundancy of these mechanisms. This
  figure was created with BioRender.com. AKT: AKT serine/threonine kinase 1; G-6P:
  glucose-6-phosphate; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HK: hexokinases;
  iNOS: inducible nitric oxide synthase; PPP: pentose phosphate pathway.'
