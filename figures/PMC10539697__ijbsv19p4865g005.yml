caption: TOF suppresses microglia polarization toward pro-inflammatory phenotype in
  vitro. (A-B) Representative flow cytometric analysis of LPS-induced primary microglia
  in each group. Histogram showing the calculated percentage of pro-inflammatory phenotype
  (iNOS+/Iba1+) primary microglia (The values are presented as mean ± SD; **p<0.01,
  ***p<0.001, one-way ANOVA; data are combined from 3 independent experiments). (C-D)
  RT-qPCR analysis of pro-inflammatory related genes expression in primary microglia
  (PM) and BV2 cells. All data were normalized to GAPDH expression (The values are
  presented as mean ± SD; *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, one-way ANOVA; data are combined
  from 3 independent experiments).
