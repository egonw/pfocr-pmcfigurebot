caption: Generation and identification of ZWB90-1 and ZWB90-3. (A) Schematic representation
  of the design of ZWB90-1 and ZWB90-3. (B) Purities and molecular weights of ZWB90-1
  and ZWB90-3 were detected by staining with Coomassie brilliant blue. Data showed
  expected band sizes and satisfactory purity levels. (C) The purities of ZWB90-1
  and ZWB90-3 were also confirmed using the SEC. (D) ForteBio Octet determination
  of the affinities of ZWB90-1 and ZWB90-3 toward c-MET. The binding affinity parameter
  KD was calculated, as reported by ForteBio Data Analysis Software 8.0 (Fremont,
  CA, USA). (E,F) Dose-dependent binding of ZWB90-3 and Emi-IgG4 in HCC827 cells and
  A549 cells. The avidities were calculated using a four-parameter logistic curve
  analysis with GraphPad software (San Diego, CA, USA). R2 is the coefficient of determination
  for estimating the goodness of the curve fit.
