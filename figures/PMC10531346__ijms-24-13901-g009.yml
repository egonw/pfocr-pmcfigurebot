caption: DFR, ANS, and, ANR expression in switchgrass and sorghum. A heatmap showing
  the relative expression patterns of flavonoid biosynthesis pathway genes in switchgrass
  (left) and sorghum (right). The switchgrass datasets include cv ‘Summer’ plants
  infested with greenbugs (GB; Schizaphis graminum) [], hybrid switchgrass plants
  (cv ‘Summer’ × cv ‘Kanlow’) infested with GB or yellow sugarcane aphids (YSA; Sipha
  flava) [], and ‘Kanlow’ (Kan) or ‘Summer’ (Sum) plants infested with fall army worm
  (FAW; Spodoptera frugiperda) []. Sorghum datasets include sugarcane aphids (SCA)
  infestation of plants from a susceptible sorghum line BCK60 and a resistant line
  RTx2783 [], expression of genes in leaves (leaf) and stems (stem) in wild-type (WT)
  and three sorghum MYB60 over-expression lines [], and in WT and two CCoAOMT over-expression
  lines []. Gene expression was standardized to z-scores separately for each experiment.
  Magenta = high expression, black = intermediate expression, cyan = low/no expression,
  grey = no detectable expression within an experiment. Gene abbreviations are the
  same as in . In all panels when present, con = controls; D5, D10, and D15 refer
  to sampling dates within each experiment. Specific details can be found in the respective
  cited references.
