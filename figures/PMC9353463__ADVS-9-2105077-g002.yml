caption: 'CGE nanoparticle‐mediated TMEM44‐AS1 silencing synergistically reversed
  5‐FU resistance. A) Sketch map showing synthesis of CGE nanoparticles and siRNA
  loading. B) The shape of the CGE nanoparticles. C) FTIR spectrum of EGCG, chitosan,
  gelatin, mixture of EGCG, chitosan and gelatin, and CGE nanoparticles. D) Binding
  ability of CGE to siRNA at different mass ratios, assessed using gel electrophoresis.
  E) Confocal microscopy analysis of lipo2000/FAM‐siRNA or CGE/FAM‐siRNA distribution
  in HGC‐27/R and MKN‐45/R cells. Green: fluorescein‐labeled siRNA; blue: Hoechst
  33342‐stained nuclei. Scale bar, 10 µm. F) Optimal ratio of CGE to siRNA was determined
  through RT‐qPCR. G) Representative confocal images of HGC‐27/R and MKN‐45/R cells
  incubated using CGE/FAM‐siNC under 37 °C for 1, 3, and 6 h. Hoechst 33342 (blue)
  was used to stain nuclei, LysoTracker Red (red) was used to stain endo/lysosomes,
  while FAM (green) was used to label siRNAs. Scale bar, 10 µm. H) After addition
  of 5‐FU (5 µg mL−1) into medium, proliferative ability of HGC‐27/R and MKN‐45/R
  cells subject to Lipo2000/si‐TMEM44‐AS1 or CGE/si‐TMEM44‐AS1 transfection was assessed
  through CCK‐8 assay. Proliferation rates at diverse time periods were calculated
  relative to that at 0 h. I) CCK‐8 assay was conducted to assess cell viability at
  48 h post‐treatment with CGE+ 5‐FU, CGE only, or 5‐FU only. J) After 48 h of 5‐FU
  (5 µg mL−1) treatment, cell apoptosis rate was determined in cells treated with
  Lipo2000/si‐NC, lipo2000/si‐ TMEM44‐AS1, CGE/si‐NC, or CGE/si‐TMEM44‐AS1 by flow
  cytometry. Data are mean ± SD, n = 3. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.'
