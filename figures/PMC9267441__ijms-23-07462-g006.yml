caption: (a) Inhibition activity of methanol-soluble steam-exploded lignin fraction
  (SEL-F2); (b) effects of tyrosinase (TYR) concentrations ([E]) on its activity at
  different SEL-F2 concentrations ([I]); (c) TYR inhibition kinetics of SEL-F2 by
  Lineweaver-Burk plots. The two parts on the right represent the secondary slope
  and the intercept of the straight lines versus SEL-F2 concentration, respectively,
  and the fluorescence spectra of TYR in the presence of different SEL-F2 concentrations.
