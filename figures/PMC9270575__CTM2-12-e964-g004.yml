  comparing clinical data of metabolic subset 1 (MS1) and metabolic subtype 2 (MS2);
  (B) heat map of differentially expressed immune cell signatures in the discovery
  set and the GSE172057 validation set; (C) box plots of the immune (a composite score
  of immune cell types) and the microenvironment scores (a composite score of immune
  cell types and stromal cell types) in the discovery set and the GSE172057 validation
  set; (D) heat map of differentially expressed haematopoietic stem cell signatures
  in the discovery set; (E) Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of retinoic acid signalling
  pathway genes; (F) heat map of differentially expressed hematopoietic stem cell
  signatures in the GSE172057 validation set'
