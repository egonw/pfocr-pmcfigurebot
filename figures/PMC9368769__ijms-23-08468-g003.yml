caption: 'Modulation of bone remodeling by natural products via Keap-1/Nrf2 signaling
  pathway. Bone loss caused by oxidative stress due to an imbalance in the antioxidant
  and free radicals in the system can be alleviated by natural products with antioxidant
  ability. Natural products promote the cytosol-to-nuclear translocation of Nrf2 (when
  detached from its repressor, Keap-1, during increased ROS generation) to interact
  with its operator, ARE, to induce the expression of antioxidant enzymes. Increased
  availability of antioxidant enzyme will hence scavenge the ROS and prevent ROS-mediated
  bone loss. Abbreviations: GCS—γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase; HO-1—heme oxygenase-1;
  NQO1—NAD(P)H:quinone reductase; Keap-1—Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1; Nrf2—nuclear
  factor E2-related factor 2; ARE—antioxidant response element; GPx—glutathione peroxidase;
  GST—glutathione-S-transferase; CAT—catalase; DEX—dexamethasone.'
