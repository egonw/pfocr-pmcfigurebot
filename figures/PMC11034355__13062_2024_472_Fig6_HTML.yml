caption: TNK2 is essential for ZNF692-mediated activation of MEK/ERK signaling pathway.
  (A-C) Western blot and quantitative analyses of MEK1/2, P-MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and P-ERK1/2
  in osteosarcoma cells transfected with siRNA specifically targeting TNK2 (siTNK2)
  and negative control (siNeg). (D-F) Western blot and quantitative analyses of MEK1/2,
  P-MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and P-ERK1/2 in osteosarcoma cells transfected with empty vector
  and TNK2 overexpression plasmid. (G-I) Western blot and quantitative analyses of
  MEK1/2, P-MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and P-ERK1/2 for the indicated groups revealed that enforced
  expression of TNK2 attenuated inhibitory effect of ZNF692 knockdown on P-MEK1/2
  and P-ERK1/2 (- and + stand for categorical values absent and present, referring
  to gene knockdown or overexpression by means of the listed constructs) (J-L) Western
  blot and quantitative analyses of MEK1/2, P-MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and P-ERK1/2 for the
  indicated groups revealed that silencing TNK2 in osteosarcoma cells partially reversed
  promoting effect of ZNF692 overexpression on P-MEK1/2, P-ERK1/2. Student’s t-test
  and one-way ANOVA were performed to analyze differences between groups. All data
  are presented as means ± standard deviations (SD). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001
