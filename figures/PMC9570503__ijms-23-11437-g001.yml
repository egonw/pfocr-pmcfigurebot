caption: 'Modulating effect of WISP1 on the cell proliferation and contraction in
  prostate fibroblast HPrF cells. (A) Expression of WISP1 in prostate cells was determined
  by a RT-qPCR. (B) Two WISP1 isoforms (WISP1v1 and WISP1v2) were found in the human
  prostate fibroblast HPrF cells by RT-PCR with the pair of primers as shown. The
  secretion of WISP1 (C) and mRNA levels of WISP1v1 and WISP1v2 (D) after WISP1 was
  knock-downed in the HPrF cells (M: 100 bp Marker; 1: HPrF_shCOL; 2: HPrF_shWISP1).
  (E) Gene profile of human prostate fibroblast HPrF cells after WISP1 was knock-downed.
  Cell proliferation (F) and contraction (G) of the mock-knock-down HPrP (HPrF_shCOL)
  and the WISP1-knock-down HPrF (HPrF_shWISP1) cells were measured by the EdU proliferation
  and collage contraction assays, respectively. Data are presented as the mean percentage
  (Â±SE; n = 3) of the HPrF_shWISP1 cells in relation to the HPrF_shCOL cells. * p
  < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; ND: no detectable.'
