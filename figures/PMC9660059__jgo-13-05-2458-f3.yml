caption: STING regulates biological characteristics through the AMPK-mTOR pathway
  and glucose uptake in CRC cells. (A-C) GSEA was conducted using gene sequencing
  data from the GEO GSE129436 and 100179 data sets (KEGG enrichment, tumor-associated
  pathways). (D) cBioPortal indicated that STING is closely related to the mammalian
  target of the rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway in CRC. (E) 48 hours after the
  transfection of STING siRNA and the negative control siRNA, the expressions of p-mTOR,
  T-mTOR, p-guanosine monophosphate-adenosine 5â€™-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein
  kinase (AMPK), T-AMPK, and STING were detected by Western blot assays. (F) For the
  quantitative analysis of the gray value of results in (E), we repeated the experiment
  three times. (G) A glucose fluorescent probe was used to detect the glucose uptake
  of the HCT116 and SW480 CRC cells. Average fluorescence intensity was quantified
  by randomly selecting 5 microscopic fields. P<0.05 was considered statistically
  significant. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, and ***P<0.001. CRC, colorectal cancer; GSEA, Gene
