caption: 'Graphic representation of the most relevant pathways regulating sustaining
  proliferative signalling in oral squamous cell carcinomas. (A) Tyrosine kinase receptors
  (e.g., EGFR or ErbB2) may be activated on the cell membrane by extracellular growth
  factors (e.g., EGF) or by constitutive mutations of the genes that encode them.
  Consequently, (B) Ras is downstream activated through the stimulation of these receptors,
  although Ras can be also activated by mutations, representing an influential central
  point in oral carcinogenesis, able to stimulate two important downstream oncogenic
  pathways: PI3K (pathway graphically represented in purple colour) and/or MAPK (pathway
  graphically represented in pink colour). (C) The PI3K pathway (PI3K-Akt-mTor, green),
  which can be blocked by its potent supressor PTEN (C), regulates the downstream
  translation of CCND1 mRNA via mTor (C). This pathway can also be constitutively
  activated by PI3K mutations (C). In parallel, (D) the endpoint of the MAPK pathway
  (Raf-MEK-Erk; in pink colour), which can also be activated by the constitutive mutation
  of Raf (D), is the Erk-mediated transcriptional activation of CCND1 (D). A third
  key pathway in the oncogenic activation of cyclin D1 is (E) NF-kB (in blue colour),
  which can be activated by IKK, as a consequence of PI3K pathway activation. (F)
  CCND1 transcriptional activation mediated by ERK, and mTor-mediated translation
  of its messenger RNA, are both essential for the ribosomal synthesis of cyclin D1,
  which forms complexes with its binding partners, CDK4/6, that finally translocate
  to the nucleus. (G) Nuclear Cyclin D1-CDK4/6 complexes subsequently activate the
  retinoblastoma pathway, in which the release of transcription factors E2F is induced
  by the translocation of a phosphate group, (H) with progression from G1 to S phase
  of the cell cycle. Activation of the retinoblastoma pathway can be prevented (I)
  through the potent inhibition of Cyclin D1-CDK4/6 by the product of tumour suppressor
  gene CDKN2A (i.e., p16INK4), blocking cell cycle advance; or alternatively by the
  tumour suppressor p53 (J), which plays an important role arresting the cell cycle
  progression, repairing the damaged DNA or finally promoting apoptosis, in an effort
  to prevent sustaining proliferation in cancer cells.'
