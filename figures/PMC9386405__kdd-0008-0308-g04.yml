caption: DSF inhibited the renal pyroptosis signaling pathway in PHN rats. a Representative
  renal GSDMD(N)/Synaptopodin and GSDMD(N)/ZO-1 double immunofluorescent staining
  of the rats (n = 6) in each group; Scale bars = 20 μm. b, c Representative renal
  immunohistochemical staining (b) and semiquantification based on the glomerular
  IOD/area of GSDMD(N), NF-κB p65, p-NF-κB p65 (Ser536), NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1, IL-1β,
  and IL-18 (c) of the rats (n = 6) in each group; Scale bars = 20 μm. d Relative
  mRNA levels of glomerular GSDMD, NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1, IL-1β and IL-18 of the rats
  (n = 6) in each group. e Representative Western Blot images of renal GSDMD, NF-κB
  p65, p-NF-κB p65 (Ser536), nuclear NF-κB p65, nuclear p-NF-κB p65 (Ser536), NLRP3,
  ASC, Caspase-1, Caspase-1 p20, IL-1β, IL-1β (mature form), IL-18 and the internal
  control (GAPDH, Histone H3) of the rats (n = 6) in each group. Serum IL-1β (f) and
  IL-18 (g) of the rats (n = 6) in each group on days 1, 5, 8, 15 after model establishment.
  The data above are shown as the mean ± SD (c, d, f, g) and were compared to the
  PHN group (f, g). ANOVA with LSD-t test (equal variances assumed) or Welch's test
  with Dunnett's T3 test (equal variances not assumed) was used for multiple comparisons
  among groups. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01.
