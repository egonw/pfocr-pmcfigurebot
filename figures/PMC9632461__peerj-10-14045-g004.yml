figure_title: Effects of CA on mitochondrial dynamics genes and autophagy-related
  proteins in H2O2-treated murine LMSCs
caption: '(A) The mRNA levels of FIS1, MFN1, MFN2, DRP1, OPA1 and PGC-1 Î± in groups.
  Data were obtained from six independent experiments; #P < 0.05 versus CTRL groups;
  *P < 0.05, @P > 0.05 versus H2O2 groups. (B) The protein expression levels of Beclin-1;
  @P > 0.05 versus CTRL group. (C) The protein expression levels of LC3-II; @P > 0.05
  versus CTRL group, *P < 0.05 versus H2O2 group. (D) The protein expression levels
  of P62; #P < 0.05 versus CTRL group; *P < 0.05, @P > 0.05 versus H2O2 group. Protein
  expression levels were obtained from three independent experiments.'
