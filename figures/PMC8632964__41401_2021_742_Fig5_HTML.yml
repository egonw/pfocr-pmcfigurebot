figure_title: EF activates the AMPK-mediated signaling pathway but fails to deactivate
  the MAPK pathway
caption: RAW264.7 cells (a) and BMDMs (b) were pretreated with EF (0, 3, 10, 30, and
  100 μM) for 0.5 h, followed by stimulation with LPS (100 ng/mL) for another 0.5 h.
  a, b The total protein of cells was extracted, and the expression levels of p-p38,
  p38, p-JNK, JNK, p-ERK, and ERK were analyzed by Western blot with β-actin as the
  loading control. RAW264.7 cells (c, e) and BMDMs (d, f) were plated in 6-well plates,
  pretreated with EF (0, 3, 10, 30, and 100 μM) for 0.5 h, and then challenged with
  LPS (100 ng/mL) for another 0.5 h. c, d The protein expression levels of p-AMPK
  and AMPK were measured using Western blot analysis. e, f The ratio of p-AMPK/AMPK
  was quantified using ImageJ software. g–i RAW264.7 cells pretreated with 5 μM Compd
  C were treated with EF (100 μM) for 0.5 h and then challenged with LPS (100 ng/mL)
  for another 24 h. The protein expression levels of iNOS and Nrf2 were measured,
  β-actin was used as a loading control (g), iNOS/β-actin (h), and Nrf2/β-actin (i)
  were analyzed by ImageJ software. Data are shown as the mean ± SEM, n = 3, *P < 0.05;
  **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
