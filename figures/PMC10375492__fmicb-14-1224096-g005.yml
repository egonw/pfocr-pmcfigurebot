caption: Defense response of Populus nigra infected by Fusarium sp. WT and TF65-6.
  Relative expression of PR1 and PR2 in the SA signal transduction pathway, and JAR1
  and COI1 in the JA signal transduction pathway of Populus nigra inoculated with
  Fusarium sp. INECOL_BM-06 WT and TF65-6. Expression is relative to UBQ expression
  and control condition. Bars are average ± SD of three technical replicates. (***value
  of p<0.001, **value of p<0.01, *value of p<0.05 by Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni
  multiple comparison correction).
article_title: The biological relevance of the FspTF transcription factor, homologous
  of Bqt4, in Fusarium sp. associated with the ambrosia beetle Xylosandrus morigerus.
