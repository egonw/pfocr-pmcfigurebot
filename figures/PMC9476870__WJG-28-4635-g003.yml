caption: 'Effects of Yinchenhao decoction on the proteins related to the NF-E2 related
  factor 2 signaling pathway. A: Effect of Yinchenhao decoction (YCHD) on NF-E2 related
  factor 2 (Nrf2) translocation. Nrf2 nucleus localization was measured by immunohistochemistry
  (DAB staining × 400, scale bar 100 µm). The nucleus is blue and the positive expression
  of DAB is brown; B: Expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and endothelial
  nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in each group (scale bar 100 µm); C: The nucleus positive
  rate of Nrf2; D: Relative expression levels of iNOS and eNOS; E: Validation of the
  potential targets using western blotting. Representative western blotting images
  of the protein kinase of Nrf2, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), NAD(P)H
  quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST); F: The bar
  chart displays the relative levels of Nrf2, Keap1, NQO1 and GST. Group S: Sham group;
  Group M: Obstructive jaundice model group; Group Y: YCHD-treated group. aP < 0.05,
  bP < 0.01, cP < 0.001 vs Group M; dP <0.001, eP < 0.05 , fP < 0.01 vs Group S.'
