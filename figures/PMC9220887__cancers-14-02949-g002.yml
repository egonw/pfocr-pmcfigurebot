caption: 'Mifepristone produces synergistic cytotoxicity with VCP inhibitors. (A):
  High-grade serous ovarian cancer cell lines OVCAR10, OVCAR5, OVCAR8, and OVSAHO
  as well as clear cell ovarian cancer cell lines RMG1 and SKOV3 were treated with
  different combinations of mifepristone (between 5 and 20 µM) and CB-5083 (between
  0.25 and 1 µM). Combination indexes (CIs) were calculated at all such combinations
  that yielded an effect between 20 and 80% cytotoxicity. Each data point is shown
  as the mean CI of all calculated combinations and 95% confidence interval. “n” represents
  the total number of CIs calculated from the combinations that produced the combined
  effect of 20–80% cytotoxicity from three biological replicates. Mean combination
  index (CI) less than 1 indicates synergy. (B): Same as (A) but treated with different
  combinations of mifepristone (between 5 and 20 µM) and DBeQ (between 1 and 7.5 µM).
  (C): Same as (A) but treated with different combinations of mifepristone (between
  5 and 20 µM) and NMS-873 (between 1 and 2.5 µM). (D): RMG1 cells were treated with
  the indicated concentrations of CB-5083 and mifepristone for 48 h followed by 6–8
  days of recovery in regular medium. Mean percent survival ± SEM was calculated based
  on the number of colonies from three biological replicates. (E): Same as (D) but
  in OVSAHO cells. Percent survival was calculated based on the number of colonies
  from three biological replicates.'
