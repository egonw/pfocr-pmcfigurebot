caption: 'Effect of ginsenoside Rg1 on inflammatory factors and ECM-related protein
  in IL-1β-induced NP cells. (A, B) The expression of IL-6 and TNF-α detected by qRT-PCR
  and ELISA. (C, D) The relative expression of MMP3, aggrecan, and collagen II detected
  by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Data were presented as mean ± SD of at least three
  repeated experiments. *p < 0.05, vs control group; #p < 0.05, vs IL-1β group.'
article_title: Ginsenoside Rg1 relieves rat intervertebral disc degeneration and inhibits
  IL-1β-induced nucleus pulposus cell apoptosis and inflammation via NF-κB signaling
  pathway.
