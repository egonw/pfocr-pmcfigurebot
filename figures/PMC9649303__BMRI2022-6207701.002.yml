caption: Analysis of HR-HPV infection plasma reveals HPV-related differences in metabolites.
  (a). Heatmap of differential metabolites with intensities determined by LC-MS. Hierarchical
  clustering analysis was performed to assess significantly upregulated and downregulated
  metabolites between HPV16 (+) and CTL plasma. (b). Hierarchical clustering analysis
  was performed to assess significantly upregulated and downregulated metabolites
  between HPV18 (+) and CTL plasma. Increased and decreased metabolite levels are
  depicted by red and blue colors, respectively. VIP, variable importance in projection.
  (c). Pathway clustering analysis of the HPV16 (+) samples, with significantly enriched
  pathway clusters identified based on Pâ€‰value < 0.05 and depicted on a logarithmic
  scale (log2). (d). Pathway clustering for metabolites enriched in HPV18 (+) samples
  by metabolomics analysis. (e). Number of shared metabolites among the high-risk
  positive groups visualized on a Venn diagram. (f). Number of shared metabolites
  that belong to amino acids and peptides, monosaccharides, glycerophosphocholines,
  steroid conjugates, fatty acid moieties, organooxygen compounds, ceramide-1-phosphate,
  carboxylic acids and derivatives, diarylheptanoids, coumarins and derivatives, benzene
  derivatives, diarylpropanoids, etc.
