figure_title: Distinct metabolic characteristics of tumor-induced de-differentiated
  adipocytes
caption: (A and B) Interactive PCA analysis and heatmap of metabolite profile in the
  culture medium of de-differentiated adipocytes (EGFP+, tdTomato−) and tumor-associated
  fibroblasts (EGFP−, tdTomato+) isolated from AlloChaser-tumor (n = 3). At fasted
  condition, medium was analyzed in the absence of serum for 6 hr.(C and D) The metabolome
  map of matched metabolic pathways in fed and fasted condition according to the p
  values from the enrichment analysis and impact values from the pathway topology
  analysis. Colors varying from yellow to red indicate the metabolites are in enrichment
  analysis with different levels of significance.(E and F) Enhance glycolysis in EGFP
  + cells (n = 6–7).(G–I) EGFP + cells exhibit similar basal and maximal oxygen consumption
  rate (OCR) but have higher coupling efficiency (n = 6–7). Conditioned medium (CM)
  from EGFP + cells and EGFP− cells shows similar effects on the proliferation of
  various human (J) and mouse (K) breast cancer cells (n = 4). Data are presented
  as mean ± SEM. Unpaired Student’s t test was used in (E)-(I); two-way ANOVA with
  Holm-Sidak’s multiple comparisons test was used in (J) and (K). *p < 0.05; **p <
  0.01.
