caption: Schematic depicting circHIPK3 upregulation exacerbates podocyte injuries
  and proteinuria in DKD through facilitating transcriptional activation of EDA2R
  in a FUS dependent manner. Under diabetic conditions, upregulated circHIPK3 facilitates
  the enrichment of FUS on EDA2R promoter, resulting in activation of EDA2R-mediated
  apoptosis signaling pathway in podocytes.
