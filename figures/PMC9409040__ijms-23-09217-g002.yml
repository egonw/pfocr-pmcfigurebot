caption: E4F1 directly controls a limited set of genes in the TNBC cell line SUM159,
  including a sub-program involved in the ATM/ATR-CHEK signaling pathway. (A)—Fold
  change plot of differentially expressed genes, assessed by RNA-Seq, in SUM159 cells
  four days after the initial exposure to either shCtrl or shE4F1. The expression
  of a large set of genes is moderately deregulated in E4F1-depleted cells compared
  to control; (B)—Identification of E4F1 target genes by ChIP-Seq. E4F1 ChIP-Seq read
  densities in the 3 kb regions surrounding the Transcription Start Sites (TSS) of
  the closest genes located nearby E4F1 binding sites, as identified in SUM159 cells.
  Out of the 116 ChIP-Seq peaks identified by ChIP-Seq in SUM159 cells (n = 2; , 102
  were in these 3kb regions and 94 in promoters, indicating that E4F1 is mainly located
  nearby or on the TSS of its target genes; (C)—MEME logo sequence analysis of the
  DNA fragments bound by E4F1 in SUM159 cells reveals a human E4F1 consensus motif
  that is similar to the Mouse E4F1 consensus motif previously identified by our laboratory
  []; (D)—Venn diagram of the overlap between all of the E4F1 bound genes identified
  by ChIP-Seq in SUM159 cells (GSE128104 (in red)) and genes differentially expressed
  (p < 0.05) between SUM159 cells treated with either shCtrl or shE4F1 (GSE128099
  (in blue)). These genome-wide analyses were performed at a time where all of the
  cells treated with shRNAs were still viable (annexin-V negative) and still actively
  growing. The overlap defines a set of 57 genes directly bound and regulated by E4F1
  in SUM159; (E)—List of the 57 E4F1 direct target genes as defined in panel D. Table
  provides information about the differential expression of transcripts in SUM159
  cells treated with either shCtrl or shE4F1 (Ratio KO/WT), the distance of the E4F1
  consensus motif to the transcription start site (TSS) of the gene, and whether these
  genes code for factors involved in cellular stress response and checkpoints (red+)
  including proteins involved in the ATM/ATR-CHK kinases axis (CHK1, PPP5C and TTI2).
