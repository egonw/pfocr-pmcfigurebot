caption: Targeted therapies and resistance for melanoma. (A) This panel depicts the
  major players in the MAPK signaling pathway along with two drugs used to inhibit
  the pathway. Vemurafenib is a RAF inhibitor, while Trametinib is an MEK inhibitor.
  (B) Combination therapy and targeted therapy resistance. BRAF and MEK inhibitors
  can be used together to overcome the resistance to BRAF inhibitors. However, tumors
  can use other mechanisms to escape BRAF/MEK inhibitor treatment, including up-regulating
  RAS and/or PI3K-AKT pathways. Some tumor cells have mutations in RAS, RAF, or MEK
  that allow them to escape canonical BRAF/MEK inhibitor treatment, while others are
  able to grow and proliferate due to stromal cells that secrete high levels of HGH
  (see the text). The illustrations were inspired by BioRender.
