caption: Study of IL6/IL11 signaling pathways for COVID-19 versus healthy control
  samples using DiSiR from lung scRNA-seq data. (A) SPRING representation of lung
  scRNA-seq data and its corresponding cell types. (B) Heatmap plot and (C) chord
  diagrams illustrating the difference between cell–cell communications identified
  by DiSiR for the IL6/IL11 signaling pathway, i.e. IL6|IL6R + IL6|IL6ST and IL11|IL116A + IL11|IL6ST,
  between COVID-19 versus control samples in lung scRNA-seq data, using the default
  threshold level (Th= 0). As can be seen, no significant IL11|IL116A + IL11|IL6ST
  interaction is identified by DiSiR across healthy samples.
