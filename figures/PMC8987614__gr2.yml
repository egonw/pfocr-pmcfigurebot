caption: The major establishment principles of CaOx stone, xanthine stone, UA stone,
  and CaPi stone disease models. (A) Dietary and metabolize endogenous oxalate is
  transported to MT lumen through Prestin and another unknown SLC26 transporter. Overdose
  dietary uptake of oxalate ion (Ox2-) or its metabolic precursors (HLP, EG) increases
  the concentration of Ox2- in MT lumen and facilitates the CaOx crystalization. Genetically
  knockdown of the expression of AGT increases the endogenous oxalate synthesis, bringing
  similar results. (B) In the wild-type fruit fly, purine can be digested to allantoin
  as an end product. Knockdown XDH blocks purine metabolisms at xanthine, results
  in xanthine stones, and knockdown Uro, results in UA stones. (C) Overdose dietary
  phosphate (Pi) uptake up-regulates the expression of Pi transporter MFS2 via bnl/btl/MFS2
  pathway, results in the increase of lumen Pi concentration, and CaPi stone formation.
