figure_title: Spatially resolved proteomics and phosphoproteomics reveal FGFR2b-dependent
  regulation of mTOR signalling and autophagy
caption: a Workflow of the spatially resolved proteomics and phosphoproteomics experiments
  in HeLa cells expressing the indicated constructs. b Summarised data analysis pipeline
  of proximal phosphoproteome data. c Cluster analysis of the proximal phosphoproteome
  from the indicated conditions normalised to the proximal phosphoproteome of HeLa_FGFR2bST
  GFP-APEX2 for each time point. Phosphorylated sites upregulated at 40 min stimulation
  with FGF10 in both HeLa_FGFR2bST RAB11-APEX2 and HeLa_FGFR2b-APEX2ST RAB11 are marked
  as the FGFR2b Recycling Proximal Signalling Cluster. d Overlap of proteins and phosphorylated
  proteins detected in the proximal proteome and phosphoproteome samples, respectively.
  e Distribution of the phosphorylated sites, 77,4% of which were found in the FGFR2b
  Recycling Proximal Signalling Cluster. f Overlap between the phosphorylated sites
  upregulated in the global phosphoproteome upon FGF10 stimulation and the phosphorylated
  sites upregulated in the FGFR2b Recycling Proximal Signalling cluster from the proximal
  phosphoproteome (Fig. 4c). g Phosphorylated sites identified on FGFR2 and EGFR in
  the global (blue light) or in the proximal phosphoproteome (red) or in both (blue),
  and in the phosphoproteome from HeLa_FGFR2bST cells expressing GFP, GFP-DnRAB11
  or GFP-DnDNM2 (Fig. ). Light blue with green border indicates phosphorylated sites
  found in internalisation response clusters and dark blue with green border indicates
  sites found in recycling response clusters (Fig. ). h KEGG pathway enrichment (calculated
  with Fishers Exact Test and FDR adjustment with FDR <0.005) of the phosphorylated
  sites found in the FGF10 global phosphoproteome (blue light), FGFR2b Recycling Proximal
  Signalling Cluster (red) and among the phosphorylated sites on proteins quantified
  at the proteome level from 4e (orange). Source data are provided as a Source Data
  file.
