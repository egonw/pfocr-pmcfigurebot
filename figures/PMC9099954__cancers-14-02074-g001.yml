caption: GATA5 is downregulated in both PCa samples and PCa cell lines. (A) GEPIA
  of GATA5 expression in 492 tumor and 152 normal tissues. (B) GATA5 expression was
  identified in 499 tumor and 52 normal samples from TCGA. (C) Expression in 52 pairs
  of tumorous and pericarcinomatous tissues from TCGA. (D) ROC analysis results of
  GATA5. (E) Western blotting showed the GATA5 expression in PCa and adjacent tumor
  tissues. (F) Relative mRNA expression of GATA5 in PCa and adjacent tumor tissues.
  (G,H) GATA5 was downregulated at both the mRNA and protein levels in PCa cell lines
  compared to RWPE-1 cells. (I) Promoter methylation level of GATA5 in PCa from TCGA.
  (J) The level of GATA5 mRNA in PCa cell lines after treatment with 5-Aza-CdR (5
  μM) for 24 h. Data are presented as mean ± SD of at least three experiments. * p
  < 0.05 and *** p < 0.001.
