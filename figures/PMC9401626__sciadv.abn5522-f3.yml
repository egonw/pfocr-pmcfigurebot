figure_title: VCAM1 promotes an inflammatory program and cooperates with DLL4 to enhance
  notch signaling and hematopoietic gene expression in HSC/MPP
caption: (A) Expression of known notch target genes was analyzed in cells within the
  HSC/MPP cluster from each coating condition. Expression of each gene scaled to a
  mean of 0 and unit variance within all HSC/MPP. (B) The average of the notch target
  genes shown in (A) was combined on a per-cell basis and normalized to the average
  of 50 randomly selected reference genes selected from the same expression bins to
  create a single-cell notch activity score. The notch activity score is reported
  for HSC/MPP from each coating condition. P values reflect two-way ANOVA, Tukey’s
  multiple comparison test. (C) Differential expression analysis (Wilcoxon rank sum)
  was performed on the HSC/MPP cells between each pair of coating conditions. Values
  indicate the number of significantly differentially expressed genes (Padjusted <
  0.05) identified in each pairwise comparison. (D) Differential pathway activity
  within HSC/MPP across coating conditions. Pairwise comparisons were performed between
  each coating condition and all others, and the top eight differentially active pathways
  by z score from each comparison are depicted. Box shading indicates which pathways
  are in the top eight of a given comparison and which comparisons have Padjusted
  < 0.05. (E to G) Comparison of SCENIC regulon activity between coating conditions.
  The top 10 regulons specific to each coating condition are shown. Regulon specificity
  is calculated as the Jensen-Shannon distance between conditions. (H) Model of the
  impact of coating conditions on notch signaling and associated notch dependence
  of transcriptional programs and cell fate decisions.
