caption: 'The effect of SANG on TNBC cells migration assay. TNBC cells of the same
  densities were seeded in two-well inserts and incubated overnight. Following the
  silicon insert removal and PBS wash, cells were treated with SANG and imaged at
  0 time. Treated cells were incubated until the control gaps were closed. At 48 h,
  cells were again imaged (phase contrast, 20×), and the gap widths were analyzed.
  The red lines represent the approximate cell front (A,B). The generated data (C,D)
  are presented as the mean ± SEM of ≥2 studies (n = 3). One-way ANOVA, followed by
  Bonferroni multiple comparisons test, were performed to confirm the statistically
  significant anti-migration. ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001 are considered significant
  differences. Scale bar: 50 μm.'
