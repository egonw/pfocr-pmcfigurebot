figure_title: CRISPR-cas9 mediated knockout of GAME36 results in loss of acetoxytomatine
  in leaves and flowers of tomato
caption: 'a Schematic representation of GAME36 with location of guide RNA sequences,
  CRISPR-Cas9 cleavage sites and game36 mutant sequences. Four independent, homozygous
  game36 mutant lines (#14, #18, #41 and #50) were generated in the tomato (cv. Micro
  Tom) background. Protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs) and inserted bases are shown
  in red and blue respectively and deleted bases are replaced by a dash. Selected
  game36 mutant sequences are presented here. Refer to Supplementary Fig.  for additional
  game36 mutant sequences obtained in this study. b Levels of α-tomatine, hydroxytomatine,
  and acetoxytomatine SGAs in leaves and flowers of game36 mutant lines as compared
  to wild type ones. Acetoxytomatine was not detected in the game36 mutant lines.
  The values indicate means of biological replicates ± standard error mean (n = 4
  for wild type, n = 3 for #14 and #18 lines, and n = 2 for #41 and #50 lines). Asterisks
  indicate significant changes compared to wild type samples as calculated by a two-tailed
  Student’s t-test (*P-value < 0.05; **P-value < 0.01; ***P-value < 0.001). LC-MS
  was used for targeted SGAs analysis. Source data (for panel b) are provided as a
  Source Data file.'
