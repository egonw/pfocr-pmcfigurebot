caption: Activation of Yki after bacterial infection. (A) Western blot analysis of
  phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Yki in hemocytes from shrimp infected with V.
  parahaemolyticus (Vpa) and B. thuringiensis (Bt). The gray values of Yki bands were
  normalized to those of β-actin. (B) Western blot analysis of Yki protein distribution
  in the nucleus and cytoplasm of hemocytes from bacteria-infected shrimp. The gray
  values of Yki bands in the nucleus and cytoplasm were normalized to those of histone
  H3 and β-actin, respectively. **, p < 0.01 and n.s., p > 0.05 by two-tailed unpaired
  Student’s t-test. (C) Immunofluorescence analysis of the expression of Yki in hemocytes
  at 3 h post V. parahaemolyticus or PBS-mock infection.
