caption: Characteristics and expression of UC.145 in gastric cancer (GC). (a) Transcribed
  ultraconserved region (T-UCR) expression was altered in GC tissues compared with
  that in adjacent healthy tissues. Rows represent individual T-UCRs. Columns represent
  GC samples. Heat maps of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and T-UCR are presented using
  hierarchical cluster analysis (FC > 2.0, p < 0.05); (b) Expression of T-UCR; (c)
  Venn-diagram-based analysis of ten non-coding RNAs, including UC.145, using targeted
  EZH2 (blue circle) predicted using RNAInter, PRIdictor, and RPIseq, and upregulated
  non-coding RNAs obtained by Agilent human chip analysis (red circle). Interaction
  scores are also displayed; (d) Genetic information of UC.145 obtained from the UCSC
  Genome Browser database; (e) UC.145 expression measured in five GC cell lines and
  one normal human gastric epithelial cell line (GES-1); (f) UC.145 expression measured
  using qRT-PCR for 100 paired GC and normal tissue samples; (g) RIP analysis performed
  with the anti-EZH2 antibody using AGS and MKN74 cell lysates. UC.145 expression
  in cell lysates and immunoprecipitates measured using qRT-PCR. LncRNA HOTAIR served
  as the positive control; (h) UC.145 expression in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions
  of AGS and MKN74 cells measured using qRT-PCR; (i) Knockdown effect of siRNA on
  UC.145 expression in AGS and MKN74 cells measured using qRT-PCR; (j) Increased expression
  of UC.145 upon transfection with overexpression vector in AGS and MKN74 cells measured
  using qRT-PCR. Data are shown as mean ± SD of three independent experiments (**
  p ≤ 0.01).
