caption: 'Anti-IL-10 partially reverses MS-induced pulmonary protection. The representative
  flow cytometry plot indicates the EOS cell percentage in one lung (a), and the data
  are graphed (b). The IgE and IL-4 levels in BALF were measured and analyzed by ELISA
  (c), and the IL-5 and IL-10 cytokine levels in serum were assessed and analyzed
  by ELISA (d). The data are presented in the form of the mean ± SEM (n = 6 per group).
  ∗ and ∗∗ denote P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively, versus control group; # and
  ## denote P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively, versus asthma group; △ and △△ denote
  P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively, versus asthma-MS group.'
