caption: Schematic of shared and region-specific changes observed in the SCA1 KI mouse
  cortex and cerebellum during early stage of the disease at 12 weeks. (A), Cortex-specific
  changes observed in the SCA1 KI mice include region-specific differences in p62
  aggregation colocalizing with ataxin-1 nuclear inclusions, and phosphorylation regulation.
  (B), Shared SCA1 disease signatures include synaptic transmission and cell to cell
  signaling. (C), Cerebellum-specific changes identified in the SCA1 KI mice include
  GPCR signaling, response to dopamine, and serotonin receptor signaling pathway.
