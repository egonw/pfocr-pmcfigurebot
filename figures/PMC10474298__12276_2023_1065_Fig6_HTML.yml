figure_title: Rnf146 overexpression increases excitatory synaptic transmission in
  prefrontal pyramidal neurons
caption: 'a Spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current (sEPSC) traces of prefrontal
  neurons in Rnf146- and eGFP-overexpressing mice. Scale bar: 50 pA, 500 ms. b The
  sEPSC amplitude of prefrontal neurons in Rnf146-overexpressing mice was significantly
  larger than that in eGFP-overexpressing mice (n = 13 cells from 5 mice for eGFP,
  n = 16 cells from 6 mice for Rnf146; two-tailed unpaired t test, t27 = 3.302, **P = 0.0027).
  c The sEPSC frequency of prefrontal neurons in Rnf146-overexpressing mice was significantly
  larger than that in eGFP-overexpressing mice (n = 13 cells from 5 mice for eGFP,
  n = 16 cells from 6 mice for Rnf146; two-tailed unpaired t test, t27 = 2.373, *P = 0.0250).
  d Spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic current (sIPSC) traces of prefrontal neurons
  in Rnf146- and eGFP-overexpressing mice. Scale bar: 100 pA, 500 ms. e The sIPSC
  amplitude of prefrontal neurons in Rnf146-overexpressing mice is comparable to that
  in eGFP-overexpressing mice (n = 11 cells from 4 mice for eGFP, n = 12 cells from
  4 mice for Rnf146; two-tailed unpaired t test, t21 = 1.980, P = 0.0609). f The sIPSC
  frequency of prefrontal neurons in Rnf146-overexpressing mice is comparable to that
  in eGFP-overexpressing mice (n = 11 cells from 4 mice for eGFP, n = 12 cells from
  4 mice for Rnf146; two-tailed unpaired t test, t21 = 0.4323, P = 0.6699). g Representative
  traces of voltage responses of prefrontal neurons in Rnf146- or eGFP-overexpressing
  mice evoked by current step stimuli (−300-300 pA, 50 pA increment, 1 s). Scale bar:
  upper, 50 mV, 500 ms; lower, 500 pA, 500 ms. h Summary data of the number of action
  potentials evoked in response to 300 pA current steps. The number of AP spikes was
  comparable in the prefrontal neurons of Rnf146-overexpressing mice relative to those
  of eGFP-overexpressing mice (n = 13 cells from 5 mice for eGFP, n = 16 cells from
  5 mice for Rnf146; two-way ANOVA with repeated measures: effect of injected current,
  F6, 162 = 28.24, ****P < 0.0001; effect of Rnf146 expression, F1, 27 = 0.006249,
