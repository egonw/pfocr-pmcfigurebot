caption: 'Huangqin decoction improves adiposity and hepatic histological abnormalities
  in high-fat diet-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease rats. Data are presented
  as mean ± SD (n = 4–8). aP < 0.01 vs the normal group, bP < 0.05 and cP < 0.01 vs
  the high-fat diet group. A: Workflow of the experimental design; B: Dynamic curve
  of the body weight; C-E: Barcharts showing the effects of different treatments on
  body weight (C), liver weight at the termination of the experiment (D), and liver
  index (liver weight/body weight) (E) at the termination of the experiment; F and
  G: Representative micrographs of Hematoxylin and eosin and Oil Red O stained liver
  sections; H: Quantitative analysis of positive areas in Oil Red O staining. CMC-Na:
  Sodium carboxymethylcellulose; Fen: fenofibrate; HQD: Huangqin decoction; I.G.:
  Intragastric administration.'

  resistance in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease by triggering Sirt1/NF-κB pathway.
