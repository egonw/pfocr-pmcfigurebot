caption: Lysine deprivation can increase npy transcription and activate the GCN2 pathway.
  (A) Quantitative PCR (qPCR) measuring npy mRNA expression within 240 min during
  lysine deprivation. (B) Transcript levels of appetite genes in lysine deprivation
  for 60 min. (C) atf4 and npy gene transcript levels in the medium deprived of a
  single amino acid for 60 min. (D,E) Immunoblots of eIF2α phosphorylation in methionine/lysine
  deprivation for up to 60 min. Data are compiled from three independent experiments,
  represented as mean ± S.E.M. (n = 6). Labeled means without a common lowercase letter
  differ significantly (p < 0.05). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.
