caption: R. intestinalis inhibits the inflammatory progression of UC through its metabolite
  butyrate. (A) SCFA profiling in the control, DSS, DSS + R. I, and DSS + butyrate
  groups. (B) Schematic testing of the effect of R. intestinalis and butyrate on colitis
  mice generated by DSS. (C) The percent change in body weights of mice in the three
  groups is plotted and presented. (D) The DAI scores of the control, DSS, DSS + R.
  I, and DSS + butyrate groups treated mice. (E) The colon length of the three groups
  on Day 15. (F,G) Multifactor analysis of TGF-β, IL-10, IL-6, IFN-γ, and TNF-α protein
  levels in the control, DSS, DSS + R. I, and DSS + butyrate groups. (H) Representative
  images of H&E staining among the three groups. (I) The histology score of HE staining.
  These data represent the mean ± SD of 3 replicates; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and
  *** p < 0.001.
