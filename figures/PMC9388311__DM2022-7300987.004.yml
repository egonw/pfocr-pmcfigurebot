caption: Roles of diverse levels of IL-8 in the expressing of apoptotic proteins in
  GC SGC7901 cells. (a) Western blot was used to detect the effects of different concentrations
  of IL-8 on the expression of apoptosis-related proteins in GASTRIC cancer SGC7901
  cells. (b) Histogram of Bax protein expression. (c) Histogram of Bcl-2 protein expression.
  (d) Histogram of c-Cas3 protein expression. (e) Histogram of c-Cas9 protein expression.
  ∗P < 0.05 in contrast to the controls, ∗∗P < 0.001 in contrast to the controls.
