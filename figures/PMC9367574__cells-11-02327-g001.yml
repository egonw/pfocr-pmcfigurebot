caption: 'Possible influence of the nervous system on the liver immune system after
  liver transplantation. (A) Among the interactions of neurotransmitters in liver
  injury by CCl4-induced cirrhosis, a decrease in norepinephrine (NE) is observed
  after sympathectomy, followed by a decrease in regulatory T cell (Treg) and increases
  in inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1β and monocyte chemoattractant
  protein-1 (MCP-1), in addition to increases in hepatic steatosis and brain inflammation
  markers. (B) Collectively, evidence for neuroendocrine-immune interactions in the
  liver, mainly collected in clinical trials, shows that, after liver transplantation
  (LT), the Treg cell pool is heterogeneous and may present phenotypes indicative
  of different origins. Thus, these cells may express CD45RO or CD45RA, in addition
  to presenting CD31 on the cell surface. In addition, dendritic cells (DCs) contribute
  to the regulatory microenvironment, leading to a tolerogenic response after LT.
  In the peritoneal microenvironment, it is possible that these cells are modulated
  by β-adrenergic receptors in Kupffer cells (KC) via NE, as observed in other conditions
  associated with the peritoneal microenvironment or acetylcholine (ACh) release induced
  by cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAIP) activation. These changes are able
  to induce the anti-inflammatory macrophage profile via Treg cells and thus modulate
  the inflammatory response. BNDF: brain-derived neurotrophic factor; SREBP1: sterol
  regulatory element-binding protein-1; PDL-1: programmed death-ligand 1; CTLA-1:
  cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4; α7nAChR: alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine
  receptor; AR: adrenergic receptor.'
