figure_title: The temporal properties of the BOLD “impulse response function” vary
  with stimulus duration and with brain region
caption: Impulse response functions (i.e., convolution kernels) were estimated from
  BOLD response to visual stimuli with varying durations presented in a conventional
  block design; on-block durations were 4 s, 2 s, 1 s, 0.5 s, and 0.17 s. (A) The
  stimulus-specific impulse response function timing (measured as the time to peak
  or TTP of the impulse response) and shape (measured as the full-width at half-maximum
  or FWHM of the impulse response) were estimated along the visual pathway at the
  primary visual cortex (V1), the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus,
  and the superior colliculus (SC) of the brainstem. Both TTP and FWHM became systematically
  shorter with shorter stimulus durations in all three brain regions. (B) A similar
  analysis applied to the superficial and deep cortical depths of V1, with the timing
  and shape parameters plotted from LGN as a reference. Both response timing and response
  shape were systematically faster in the deeper cortical depths compared to the superficial
  depths, but both were consistently slower than the responses measured within the
  LGN, suggesting that the fastest responses in V1 are still slower than the responses
  in LGN. (Reproduced from ​​, with permission.)
