figure_title: Regulation of gas modulator synthesis
caption: CSE is regulated by the transcription factor, ATF4 which is activated by
  amino acid starvation or during the unfolded protein response, leading to increased
  H2S synthesis (red arrow). Under hypoxia, NOS and heme oxygenase are induced leading
  to •NO and CO biosynthesis, respectively, which inhibit CBS, a hemeprotein, leading
  to reduced cystathionine. Under these conditions, the transsulfuration pathway enzymes
  switch metabolite tracks from the canonical cystathionine and cysteine producing
  reactions (white arrows) to H2S biogenesis primarily by CSE (red arrow). Thus, the
  three cellular triggers shown here have the potential to upregulate synthesis of
  the ETC gas regulators, H2S and •NO. Cyst denotes cystathionine.
