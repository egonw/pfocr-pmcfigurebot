caption: 'Old blood induces aging-like transcriptomic changes, in part, by dysregulating
  SRF-driven gene expression Panel A: Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to test
  the effect of aging on the enrichment of the set of genes whose expression is regulated
  by SRF (serum response factor) by comparing aorta samples derived from isochronic
  parabiont young mice [parabiont: young; Y–(Y)] and isochronic parabiont aged mice
  [parabiont: aged; A–(A)]. Aging-induced gene expression changes were ranked from
  most up-regulated (left) to most down-regulated (right). Ticks represent genes encoding
  SRF-regulated proteins. Shown is a running-sum statistic (enrichment score) based
  on panel C, increasing when a gene is a member of the SRF-driven gene set and decreasing
  when it is not. Panel B: GSEA showing the effect of exposure to old blood on the
  enrichment of SRF-regulated genes. Aorta samples derived from isochronic parabiont
  young mice [parabiont: young; Y–(Y)] and heterochronic parabiont young mice [parabiont:
  aged; Y–(A)] were compared. Note that in aged mice, enrichment scores increased
  predominantly on the right indicating age-related down-regulation of SRF-driven
  genes. In response to the presence of old blood in young mice, enrichment scores
  showed similar increases on the right, indicating that the presence of old blood
  in young mice mimics the effects of aging on SRF-driven genes. Panel C: The heat
  maps are graphical representations of normalized expression values of SRF-driven
  genes. Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed the similarities on aortic expression
  profiles of SRF-driven genes in aged mice and old blood exposed young mice. Panel
  D-E: Comparison analysis using the ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) tool. The upstream
  regulator heat maps depict age- and old blood-related changes in the expression
  of SRF-driven genes. Each symbol on the map represents a gene product in the SRF
  pathway. The symbols are set to color by age-related (panel D) and old blood exposure-induced
  (panel E) changes in gene expression (fold change). Red color indicates up-regulation,
  green color indicates down-regulation'
