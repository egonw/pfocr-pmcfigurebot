caption: 'ETA supplementation rescued the CAN sensitivity. (A) Schematic representation
  of CDP‐DAG and Kennedy pathway in yeast phospholipid metabolism. External supplementation
  of ETA bypasses the conventional CDP‐DAG pathway and utilizes the Kennedy pathway
  for the synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine inside the cells. (B) Yeast spot assay.
  Yeast saturated cultures of wild‐type cells were 10‐fold serially diluted (10−1,
  10−2, 10−3, 10−4) in 1.0 mL of sterile double‐distilled water, and 3 µL of each
  dilution was spotted on SCA plates containing DMSO (control) or CAN (150, 200, and
  250 µm) or ETA/CHO/INO (2.5 mm) in alone or in combinations. All plates were incubated
  at 30 °C for 72 h and photographed. The representative ETA 2.5 mm spotting assay
  image is identical in Figs  and  as we had performed both these spot assay experiments
  at the same time and this plate was kept common. (C) Growth curve assay: exponentially
  growing yeast culture of the wild‐type strain BY4741 was treated with either DMSO
  (control) or CAN (100 and 150 µm) or ETA 2.5 mm in alone or in indicated combinations
  and the growth was monitored by measuring OD600 at regular intervals of 30 min for
  48 h using a plate reader.'
