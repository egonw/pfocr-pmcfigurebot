caption: CB-Dock2 blind docking results of the IκBα/p50/p65 protein complex and curcumin/demethoxycurcumin/bisdemethoxycurcumin.
  (A) The three-dimensional (3D) binding pose of curcumin. (B) The 3D interactions
  between the IκBα/p50/p65 protein complex and curcumin. (C) The two-dimensional (2D)
  diagram of the interactions between the IκBα/p50/p65 protein complex and curcumin.
  (D) The 3D binding pose of demethoxycurcumin. (E) The 3D interactions between the
  IκBα/p50/p65 protein complex and demethoxycurcumin. (F) The 2D diagram of the interactions
  between the IκBα/p50/p65 protein complex and demethoxycurcumin. (G) The 3D binding
  pose of bisdemethoxycurcumin. (H) The 3D interactions between the IκBα/p50/p65 protein
  complex and bisdemethoxycurcumin. (I) The 2D diagram of the interactions between
  the IκBα/p50/p65 protein complex and bisdemethoxycurcumin. The red rectangles indicate
  the locations of the curcuminoid molecules, and the light green spheres in the 3D
  interactions indicate intramolecular interactions within the curcuminoid molecules.
  In the 2D diagrams and 3D interactions, the colored dashed lines linking the protein
  complex and curcuminoid denote favorable intermolecular interactions. The three-letter
  amino acid codes and positions of the contact residues are shown in the 3D interactions.
  The colored circles in the 2D diagrams denote the three-letter amino acid codes,
  occupying protein chains, and amino acid positions of the contact residues. The
  light blue circles surrounding the preceding circles are solvent-accessible surfaces.
  All figures were constructed using BIOVIA discovery studio visualizer.
