caption: The effect of melatonin on the viability of HDFs. HDFs were treated with
  various concentrations of melatonin (0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 µM) for 24, 48, and 72
  h. Cell viability was analyzed using a Trypan blue exclusion assay. Results are
  expressed as the percentage of viable cells and represented as the mean ± SD of
  three independent experiments of pooled HDFs from ten healthy donors. ** p < 0.01.
