figure_title: Overview of exosome biosynthesis and uptake pathways
caption: Intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) are synthesized from endosomes through cargo-sorting
  machineries and concurrent membrane invagination. The ILVs-containing multi-vesicle
  bodies (MVBs) then bypass lysosomal degradation and are transported to the plasma
  membrane, where they undergo vesicle docking, resulting in the release of exosomes
  into the extracellular space. Exosomes interact with the recipient cells by receptor-ligand
  interaction, membrane fusion, or phagocytosis or endocytosis. Being phagocytosed
  or endocytosed, exosomes bypass endosome-lysosome pathway and release their contents
  in the cytoplasm. Four exosomal protein sorting machineries (ESCRT-, tetraspanins-,
  Rabs-, and ceramide- dependent machineries) are depicted in the zoom-in view.
