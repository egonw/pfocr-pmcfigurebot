caption: Effect of TAF9 knockdown on RGC density in the fourth week after infarct.
  (A) Representative RGC density of the central and midperipheral retinas in each
  group. The white spots in the representative figures are the Fluoro-Gold-labeled
  RGCs in the retina. (B) Bar chart showing the RGC density in the rAION induction
  and GCSF plus TAF9 siRNA-treated rAION group was significantly reduced in the central
  and midperipheral retinas compared to that in the rAION induction and GCSF plus
  scrambled siRNA-treated group (* p < 0.05, n = 12 per group; scale bar = 200 Î¼m).
