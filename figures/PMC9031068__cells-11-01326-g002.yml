caption: Important cellular mechanisms involved in cancer and mechanisms of action
  of phytochemical drugs. Growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor
  and fibroblast growth factor, bind with their respective receptors, resulting in
  their phosphorylation, followed by the activation of downstream signaling pathways,
  such as the PI3K/Akt, PLCγ, and STAT pathways. Akt activates IKK, which is responsible
  for the activation of the NF-κB signaling and mTOR pathway; IKK exerts its effect
  on cells by regulating the hypoxia-induced factor. ROS activates the Akt and AMP-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) pathways by inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress. AMPK activates
  the tumor suppressor transcription factor (FOX O) and inhibits the action of mTOR.
  Wnt proteins suppress glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) by binding to frizzled
  receptors, disrupting the β-catenin complex (destructive complex). β-catenin accumulates
  in the cytoplasm, translocates to the nucleus, and induces cell proliferation, which
  promotes cancer by activating Wnt-regulated genes. Different phytochemicals act
  on different targets to exhibit anticancer activity.
