caption: Effects of compound H12 on MGC-803 cells. MGC-803 cells were treated with
  indicated concentrations of compound H12 for 48 h. (A) Cell viability of MGC-803
  cells after treatment with DMSO or compound H12. The experiment was repeated three
  times independently. (B) Cell growth curves of MGC-803 cells after treatment with
  DMSO or compound H12. (C) The morphological changes of MGC-803 cells after treatment
  with DMSO or compound H12.
