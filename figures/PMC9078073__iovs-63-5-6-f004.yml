caption: 'MLT inhibited TLR4-mediated proinflammatory cytokine response in LPS-stimulated
  HMGECs. The HMGECs were treated with MLT (100 µM) for 48 hours followed by LPS for
  8 hours. (A) Representative protein bands of TLR4 and MyD88. (B, C) Quantitative
  intensity of TLR4 and MyD88 (n = 4). (D) Transcriptional levels of TLR4 and cytokines
  (n = 3). (E) Secreted levels of cytokines (n = 3). *Significantly different from
  control, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. #Significantly different from LPS
  group, #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001.'
