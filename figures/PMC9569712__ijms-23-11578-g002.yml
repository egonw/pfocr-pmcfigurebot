caption: CYP4BQ1 is involved in (+)-α-pinene detoxification by D. armandi adults.
  The surviving adults were collected at 24, 48, and 72 h post exposure to LC50 (+)-α-pinene.
  (A,E) Induction of CYP4BQ1 expression by (+)-α-pinene treatment. (B,F) Repression
  of CYP4BQ1 expression in D. armandi adults injected with dsRNA. (C,G) P450 activities
  were determined after RNAi. (D,H) The mortality of adults exposed to LC50 (+)-α-pinene
  was assessed at 48 h after dsRNA injection. The asterisk indicates a significant
  difference between treatment groups (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, independent
  Student’s t-test). All values are the mean ± SE, n = 3.
