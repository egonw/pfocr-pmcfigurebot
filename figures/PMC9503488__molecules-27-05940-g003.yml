caption: 'E/NE-induced Src activation stimulates the migration and invasion of Hep3B
  and MDA-MB-231 cells. (A,B) Hep3B human HCC cells (A) and MDA-MB-231 human BC cells
  (B) were treated with E (10 μM) or NE (1 μM) for the indicated times. Phosphorylated
  Src and total Src were detected by Western blot analysis. Actin was used as the
  internal control. The representative images of duplicate experiments are shown (upper).
  The ratio of phosphorylated/total Src was calculated using ImageJ software after
  normalization to actin (lower). (C–J) Hep3B cells (C,E,G,I) and MDA-MB-231 cells
  (D,F,H,J) were seeded in the inserts of transwell plates and co-treated with adrenergic
  agonists (10 μM E for Hep3B; 1 μM NE for MDA-MB-231) and dasatinib (0.5–1 μM). After
  24 h of incubation, the migrated (C–F) or invaded (G–J) cells were stained and photographed
  (×100 magnification). (C,D,G,H) Representative images from triplicate analyses are
  shown. (E,F,I,J) Relative migration (E,F) and invasion (I,J) was calculated by counting
  the stained cells. The data are expressed as the mean ± SD of three independent
  experiments. Significance was determined by the Student’s t-test (*** p < 0.001
  vs. untreated controls; ## p < 0.01, ### p < 0.001 vs. E/NE-treated cells). HCC,
  hepatocellular carcinoma; BC, breast cancer; E, epinephrine; NE, norepinephrine;
  DA, dasatinib.'
