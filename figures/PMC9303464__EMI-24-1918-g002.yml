caption: Step‐wise representation of the regulatory model for the GSR signalling pathway
  in S. granuli TFA, indicating the interplay among the regulators and/or their state
  in the absence of stress (A), at the onset of the stress signalling (B) and once
  the GSR is fully active (C). Green squares represent the four histidine kinases
  annotated in the TFA genome, PhyR regulators are represented in dark (PhyR1) and
  light blue (PhyR2, NepR anti‐σ factors are represented in dark (NepR1) and light
  yellow (NepR2), EcfG σ factors are represented in light (EcfG1) and dark orange
  (EcfG2), genes are represented in grey. Wavy arrows indicate stress sensing (black
  lines indicate signalling through PhyR1 and PhyR2, blue lines indicate signalling
  through PhyR1, red lines indicate signalling through PhyR2); dashed arrows indicate
  phosphorylation of the PhyR regulators (either directly or through intermediate
  elements); a green circle represents the phosphorylation of PhyR1 and PhyR2; black
  arrows indicate a regulatory relationship by direct interaction (triangular arrowheads
  indicate a positive effect, flat arrowheads indicate a negative effect); grey arrows
  represent transcription and translation.
