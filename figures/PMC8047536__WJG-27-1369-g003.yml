caption: 'Anti-covalently closed circular DNA strategies and antagonistic hepatitis
  B virus proteins that modulate the interferon signalling pathway. Hepatitis B virus
  (HBV) has developed multiple mechanisms that target different parts of the intracellular
  interferon (IFN) signalling pathway to avert elimination by IFN treatment. Therapeutic
  agents that counter HBV anti-IFN signalling activities or enhance the strength of
  host cell IFN signalling may be beneficial to increase the efficiency of IFN treatment
  for the elimination or silencing of covalently closed circular DNA. HBV: Hepatitis
  B virus; IFN: Interferon; PEG: Pegylated form; SOCS: Suppressor of cytokine signalling;
  PKC-Î´: Protein kinase C-delta; IRF: Interferon regulatory factor; JAK: Activate
  janus kinase; STAT: Signal transducers and activators of transcription; Pol/RT:
  Polymerase/reverse transcriptase; TNF: Tumour necrosis factor; ISGs: Interferon-stimulated
  genes; ISRE: Interferon-stimulated response elements; cccDNA: Covalently closed
  circular DNA.'
