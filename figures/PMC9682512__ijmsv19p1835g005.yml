caption: Microarray and IPA analysis of ncRuPAR target genes and signaling pathways
  in HGC-27 human gastric cancer cells. Affymetrix GeneChip microarray (A) scatter
  plot (B) volcano plot and (C) heatmap of differentially expressed genes in HGC-27-ncRuPAR
  cells compared with HGC-27-empty vector cells. Upregulated and downregulated genes
  are shown in green and red, respectively. IPA -log(P-value) analysis profiles of
  (D) enriched disease and function and (E) enriched signaling pathways in HGC-27
  cells that overexpress ncRuPAR. (F-H) qPCR validation of differentially expressed
  genes from (F) ATM signaling, (G) thrombin signaling and (H) death receptor signaling
  pathways. (I) Gene regulatory network map of the death receptor signaling pathway
  from IPA analysis showing possible downstream targets of cyclin D1 (CCND1 gene)
  that could promote tumor apoptosis.
