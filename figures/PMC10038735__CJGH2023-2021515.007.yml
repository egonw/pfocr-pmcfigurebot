caption: 'SPI1 regulated NMT1 via PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in GC cells. (a) The protein
  levels of PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, mTOR, and p-mTOR in AGS cells were tested by
  western blot after transfection of NMT1 overexpression plasmid and shSPI1. GAPDH
  was the loading control. (b) The levels of p-PI3K/PI3K, p-AKT/AKT and p-mTOR/mTOR
  in AGS cells were tested by western blot after transfection of NMT1 overexpression
  plasmid and shSPI1. GAPDH was the loading control. (c) The protein levels of PI3K,
  p-PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, mTOR, and p-mTOR in SNU-5 cells were tested by western blot
  after transfection of shNMT1 and SPI1 overexpression plasmid. GAPDH was the loading
  control. (d) The levels of p-PI3K/PI3K, p-AKT/AKT and p-mTOR/mTOR in SNU-5 cells
  were tested by western blot after transfection of shNMT1 and SPI1 overexpression
  plasmid. GAPDH was the loading control. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001 vs.
  NC + shNC group; ∧p < 0.05, ∧∧∧p < 0.001 vs. NMT1+shNC group; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01,

  △△p < 0.01, △△△p < 0.001 vs. shNC + SPI1 group. All experiments were repeated independently
  at least three times. Data were performed as the means ± standard deviation. NMT1,
  N-myristoyltransferase 1; GC, gastric cancer; p-, phosphorylation; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; shNMT1, short hairpin RNA against NMT1; NC, negative control; shNC,
  shRNA negative control.'
