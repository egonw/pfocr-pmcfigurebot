figure_title: Tg6PGDH2 and TgRPI are required to incorporate glucose-derived carbon
  into the pentose phosphate pathway
caption: (A-C), Tg6PGDH2-cKD (WT) and Δ6pgdh2 mutants were propagated with HFF monolayers
  cultured in glucose-free DMEM medium supplemented with 8 mM 1,2-13C2-glucose for
  12 h. Subsequently, intracellular parasites were collected, metabolites were extracted
  from the parasites, and the relative abundance of isotopologues was determined by
  LC-MS. M0 means parental unlabeled. M1-M5 represents the number of carbons in a
  selected metabolite labeled with 13C atom. Values are means ± SEM from four independent
  experiments (n = 4). Student’s t-test, *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.001. (D),
  TgRPI-cKD (WT), and Δrpi mutants were cultured the same way as above. Metabolite
  from the intracellular parasites was determined by LC-MS. Values are means ± SEM
  from five independent experiments (n = 5). ***, P < 0.001 by two-way ANOVA. (E),
  Extracellular TgRPI-cKD (WT) and Δrpi parasites were incubated in a glucose-free
  medium containing 8 mM [U-13C] glucose for 4 h. Incorporation of 13C into Ru5P and
  Xu5P was determined by UHPLC-HRMS platform. M0-M5 represents the number of carbons
  in a selected metabolite labeled with 13C atom. Values are means ± SEM from five
  independent experiments (n = 5). ***, P < 0.001 by two-way ANOVA. (F), Freshly egressed
  tachyzoites (3×107) of TgRPI-cKD left untreated or pretreated with rapamycin for
  4 days were collected, syringe released, and then incubated in medium containing
  8 mM [U-13C] glucose for 4 h. Incorporation of 13C into glycolysis and PPP intermediates
  was determined by UHPLC-HRMS platform. M0-M7 represents the number of carbons in
  a selected metabolite labeled with 13C atom. Values are means ± SEM from five independent
  experiments (n = 5). *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01; ***, P < .001; all by two-way ANOVA.
