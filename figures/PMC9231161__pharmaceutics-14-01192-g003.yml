caption: 'CK suppresses hepatic fat deposit through the enhancement of lipase expression
  and autophagy. (a) Venn diagrams showing the number of unique or shared genes between
  ob vs. C57BL/6J and ob + CK vs. ob datasets. The common part (60 genes) likely reflects
  CK effect. (b) GO enrichment analysis predicted the top 30 enriched pathways of
  CK-regulated genes. Rich factor is the ratio of the differentially expressed gene
  number to the total gene number in a certain pathway. Q-value is corrected p-value
  ranging from 0–1. (c) Heat map of changes in protein levels of autophagy-related
  and fatty acid catabolism-related factors. (d) Autophagy signaling pathways analyzed
  using Western blotting of liver tissues (n = 3). (e) Gene expression of lipolysis
  factors assessed using qRT-PCR (n = 4–10). (f) Protein expression of lipolysis factors
  assessed using Western blotting (n = 3). (g) cAMP/PKA/HSL signaling pathways were
  analyzed using Western blotting of liver tissues (n = 3). (h) Gene expression of
  lipogenesis factors assessed using qRT-PCR (n = 4–10). (i) Protein expression of
  lipogenesis factors assessed using Western blotting (n = 3). Statistical data represent
  the comparison of each value in the compound-treated groups to the corresponding
  value in the ob/ob groups. Results are presented as mean ± SD. #, p < 0.05; ##,
  p < 0.01; ###, p < 0.001; *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001.'
