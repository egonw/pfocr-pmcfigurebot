caption: Characteristics of the identified proteins in PC12 cells with or without
  GDF11-treated. (A) Volcano plot of the 165 differentially expressed proteins in
  GDF11-treated group when compared to GDF11-untreated group. A protein with a fold
  change > Â±1.2 and p < 0.05 was regarded as a differentially expressed (up-regulated
  or down-regulated) protein, which was colored in red or green, respectively. The
  identified proteins with no significant changes were in black. (B) Hierarchical
  clustering heat map of the 165 differentially expressed proteins. A1, A2, and A3
  represented the 3 replicates of the GDF11-untreated group, and C1, C2, and C3 represented
  the 3 replicates of GDF11-treated PC12 cells. (C) The top 20 enrichment KEGG pathway
  of the differentially expressed proteins. (D) GO enrichment analysis of the DEPs
  in three categories, i.e., molecular function, cellular component, and biological
  process.
