caption: Functional analysis of differential proteins. (A) Scatter plots of differentially
  expressed proteins. There were 778 up-regulated proteins and 536 down-regulated
  proteins in the LM group. Abscissa is the difference multiple (logarithmic transformation
  based on 2); (B) localization analysis of differentially expressed proteins; (C)
  the gene ontology annotation analysis between DAPs and classification of BP, MF,
  and CC; (D) the KEGG pathway analysis of related DAPs; (E) the GSEA results of differentially
  abundant proteins.
