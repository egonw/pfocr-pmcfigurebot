caption: CPNE8 was overexpressed in gastric cancer and associated with poor patient
  survival. (A) Venn diagram showing genes with high expression and association with
  tumor metastasis in the TCGA-STAD cohort. (B) Comparison of CPNE8 gene expression
  between 375 tumor tissues and 32 normal tissues. (C) Normalized GEO data demonstrating
  differential expression of CPNE8 gene between 15 tumor tissues and paired normal
  tissues. (D) Increasing CPNE8 expression in metastatic gastric cancer compared to
  primary tumors. (E) The area under the ROC curve (AUC) indicated that CPNE8 revealed
  better efficiency in predicting metastatic gastric cancer. (F) Significantly different
  expression of CPNE8 among tumor stages in the TCGA-STAD cohort. (G) Significantly
  different expression of CPNE8 among tumor grades in the TCGA-STAD cohort. (H) Overall
  survival (OS) curves based on CPNE8 status. (I) Progression-free survival (PFS)
  curves based on CPNE8 status. (J) Disease-free survival (DFS) curves based on CPNE8
  expression. (K) The representative microscopy images of CPNE8 in normal tissue and
  gastric cancer tissue were shown at 100X and 200X magnifications. (L) The IHC scores
  displayed that CPNE8 was upregulated in most GC than normal tissue. (M) The overall
  survival curve was based on CPNE8 scores obtained by immunohistochemistry.
