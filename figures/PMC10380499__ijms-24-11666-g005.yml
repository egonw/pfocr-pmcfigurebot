caption: GO classification and pathway enrichment of genes related to the cell wall
  and carbohydrate metabolism. (A) Gene expression heatmap and classification. The
  left side shows that the transcriptome data are divided into different clusters,
  and the heat map is generated according to log2FPKM. The right side displays different
  GO classifications. In S1–S2 (B) and S2–S3 (C), pathways corresponding to significant
  DEGs were demonstrated. The horizontal direction represents the proportion of genes,
  while the vertical direction represents specific pathways. The color of the dot
  represents the p-value, and the size of the dot represents the number of genes.
