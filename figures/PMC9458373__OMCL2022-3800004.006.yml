caption: 'BSYS regulates the miR-155 signaling pathway in the brains of demyelinated
  mice. (a) Volcano plot and (b) heat map showing the differential miRs between CPZ
  mice and normal mice. (c, d) The levels of miR-155 and SOCS1 expressions in mice''s
  CC per group as identified by qRT-PCR (n = 5). (e) Illustrative blots and statistical
  graphs of relative protein expression of SOCS1 in CC (n = 3). Data are displayed
  as means ± SD; in contrast with the CON group, ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001; versus
  the CPZ group, ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗∗P < 0.001.'
