caption: DNA methylation signatures “normalize” in response to treatment. (A) Heat
  map displaying differentially methylated positions (DMPs) in CD4+ T-cells from “all”
  psoriasis patients (N = 4 psoriasis and N = 1 psoriatic arthritis) before and after
  treatment (N = 5 psoriasis and N = 4 psoriatic arthritis) (FDR < 0.05, |Δβ| > 0.1)
  with TNF or IL-17A inhibitors. Light purple and dark purple indicate the first and
  (where available) the second time-point after-treatment. Normalized DNA methylation
  levels are shown on the right with red indicating reduced methylation and yellow
  indicating increased methylation levels. (B) Bar diagrams depict results of the
  KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of hypermethylated genes which presented at least
  one DMP in their promoter. Top 10 pathways are represented, and the statistically
  significant ones are framed in blue. (C) IL17A/TNF methylation scores were calculated
  in patients before and after treatment and. in healthy control. ****p ≤ 0.0001,
  Anova and Tukey’s multiple comparisons. Medians are reported in red. (D) Correlation
  analysis between DNA methylation and PASI scores in the patient cohort before and
  after treatment. After assessing the Gaussian distribution, Pearson was used to
  measure the correlation.
