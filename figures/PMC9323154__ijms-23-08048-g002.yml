caption: 'Main mechanisms of action of marine natural products (MNPs) on colon and
  pancreatic cancer. Caspase activation pathway: Caspases are a family of protease
  enzymes that play essential roles in apoptosis, and they can be activated by the
  mitochondrial pathway. The permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane is the
  key mechanism for caspase activation. Release of mitochondrial components, such
  as cytochrome c,Â leads to caspase-9 activation, which leads to activation of downstream
  caspases (-3, -6, and -7) and induction of apoptosis. Pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic
  members of the Bcl-2 protein family control the permeability of the outer mitochondrial
  membrane and regulate the release of the mitochondrial intermembrane space constituents,
  including cytochrome c. MNPs interact with tubulin, causing antimitotic activity.
  Microtubules are cytoskeletal elements that play an important role in many cellular
  functions, including cell division. Cell cycle arrest: The cell cycle is a four-stage
  process. In the G1, G2, and M stages, the integrity of DNA is assessed by cyclin-dependent
  kinases (CDKs). Any disruption to these stages causes cell cycle arrest, which leads
  to apoptosis. In addition, p53 can induce S phase or G2/M arrest via P21 inhibition
  of CDKs. The presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leads to cell cycle arrest
  at the G2/M phase, followed by DNA damage accumulation and induction of apoptosis.
  X-linked and survivin are members of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family,
  and they prevent apoptosis by binding to caspases, including initiators and effectors,
  and thereby protect them from cleavage and activation. The thioredoxin (TRX) system
  is expressed in all living cells and has a variety of biological functions. It helps
  tumor cells evade apoptosis through binding to the apoptosis signal regulating kinase
  (ASK1) directly and to the tumor suppressor PTEN.'
