caption: Pllans–II does not affect mitochondrial integrity but alters genes’ expression
  related to the response to endoplasmic reticulum stress. (A) Analysis of differentially
  expressed genes (DEG) from Ca Ski cells treated with Pllans–II and control. The
  red dots in the volcano plot represent genes with significantly higher expression
  in the treatment (up–regulated), while the blue dots represent genes significantly
  sub–expressed in the treatment group (down–regulated). The gray dots indicate genes
  that are not differentially expressed. The heat map shows changes in gene expression
  for each of the treatment and control samples. The red and blue colors represent,
  respectively, the increase and decrease in expression, while the white color indicates
  no change. (B) Pathway enrichment analysis. The term (Y–axis) represents the identification
  code and the pathway for the GO and KEGG databases. Asterisk (*) indicates the pathway
  found significant for KEGG. The enrichment factor (X–axis) represents the relationship
  between the number of differentially expressed genes and the total number of genes
  in a given pathway. The area of each colored circle is proportional to the number
  of genes involved in each pathway; the color indicates the p–adjusted value. (C)
  The most affected functional module of enriched terms map from Ca Ski cells treated
  with Pllans–II. The relation of the top–30 significantly richer terms (by p–adjusted
  values) are indicated by the thickness of the lines and represent the amount of
  DEG shared between each pair of terms. The size of each node indicates the gene
  count (number of genes enriched in each category) and the color represents the adjusted
  p–value. (D) Western blot analysis of HSP70, CHOP, and Actin protein after treatment
  with Pllans–II (100 μg/mL). The densitometry of bands was quantified by ImageJ software
  and represented in a histogram.
