caption: Overlap between genes induced by BABA and genes induced in selected plants
  with altered amino acid homeostasis. (A) Degrees of overlap between orthologous
  groups identified in this study and previous transcriptomic studies on A. thaliana
  lht1 plants [], and Glu-treated rice plants []. (B) Functional enrichment of the
  plant-pathogen interaction pathway (KEGG) and protein domains related to signal
  transduction (INTERPRO) among the orthologous genes common to all three sets.
