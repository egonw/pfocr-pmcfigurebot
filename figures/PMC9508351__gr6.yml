caption: Apoptotic levels of renal histocytes in chicks. (A) The mRNA relative expression
  level of Fas. (B) The mRNA relative expression level of Fas-L. (C) The mRNA relative
  expression level of JAK. (D) TUNEL test results of renal histocytes. (E) Apoptotic
  rate of renal histocytes. (KA represents the control group, and KB represents the
  FFC treatment group. Compared with the control group, * means P < 0.05, ** means
  P < 0.01. In Figure 6D, there are apoptotic renal histocytes of chicks at the red
  arrows.)
