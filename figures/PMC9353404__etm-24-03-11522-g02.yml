caption: ANGPT2 silencing inhibits metastasis and angiogenesis of EC-9706 esophageal
  cancer cells. (A) Wound healing assay was used to determine (B) migration of EC-9706
  cells (scale bar, 100 µm). (C) Transwell assay was used to determine (D) invasion
  of EC-9706 cells (scale bar, 50 µm). (E) Expression levels of epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition-associated proteins were detected using western blot analysis. (F) Angiogenic
  effect was investigated using tube formation analysis (scale bar, 250 µm). ***P<0.001
  vs. shRNA-NC. ANGPT2, angiopoietin-2; shRNA, short harpin RNA; NC, negative control.
article_title: HOXB5-activated ANGPT2 promotes the proliferation, migration, invasion
  and angiogenic effect of esophageal cancer cells via activating ERK/AKT signaling
  pathway.
