caption: Effects of early life PCB 126 on bacteria community and metabolism in mice
  with CTRL or HFD. (A) Heatmap representation of the abundance of cecal bacteria
  from genera that were significantly changed from CTRL or HFD-fed mice with vehicle
  or PCB 126 exposure. (B) Ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes in cecal contents
  from CTRL or HFD-fed mice with vehicle or PCB 126 exposure. (C) Analysis of KEGG
  pathway abundance that significantly changed in the cecal microbiota from CTRL or
  HFD-fed mice with vehicle or PCB 126 exposure. (D) 1H NMR analysis of urine hippurate
  and phenylacetylglycine (PAG) from CTRL or HFD-fed mice with vehicle or PCB 126
  exposure. (E) 1H NMR analysis of cecal glycerol from CTRL or HFD-fed mice with vehicle
  or PCB 126 exposure. (F) Quantitative UPLC-MS analysis of bile acids in the feces
  from CTRL or HFD-fed mice with vehicle or PCB 126 exposure. Values are means ± S.D.
  (n = 6 per group). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 compared to vehicle.
