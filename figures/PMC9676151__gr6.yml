caption: LM@Co-Q10 antagonized the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. (A)
  Immunofluorescence images of P65 (red) in different groups of BMSCs. (Scale bar = 60 μm)
  (B) Quantification of red areas from A using Image J. (C) Expression level of NF-κB
  pathway-related proteins on BMSCs with different treatments. (D–F) Quantification
  of NF-κB pathway-related proteins was calculated from C by Image J. The data were
  presented as mean ± SD. ns (no statistical significance), *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01
  and ***p < 0.001 vs the control group. n = 3.
