caption: 'Rapid temperature change rate increases the phosphorylation of insulin signaling
  pathway biomolecules (IRS1, Akt(S473), GSK3β, and ERK1/2) with the exception of
  decreases in p70S6K phosphorylation. INSR, pAkt(T308), and FoxO1 phosphorylation
  are not temperature-sensitive. (A) Temperature profile illustration of the cells
  incubated at 36–45 °C (N = 3) within 5 min. Representative immunoblotting image
  of (B) C2C12 cells, (C) HepG2 cells, and (D) Fao cells. Cells were starved for 24
  h and were heated from 36 °C to 45 °C rapidly within 5 min. Insulin stimulation:
  50 nM, 10 min. The phosphorylation change (Left, C2C12 cells; Middle, HepG2 cells;
  Right, Fao cells) was quantified on (E) IRS1, (F) pAkt(S473), (G) GSK3β, (H) p70S6K,
  (I) FoxO1, and (J) ERK1/2. Columns are mean ± 95% confidence interval (N = 4 independent
  experiment). Results were normalized by β-actin (* p = 0.0021; ** p = 0.0002; ***
  p < 0.001; One-way ANOVA; Dunnett’s test comparing to 36 °C). Immunofluorescence
  analysis of Akt translocation for (K) C2C12 cells, (L) HepG2 cells, and (M) Fao
  cells. Cells were heated to 45 °C (in 5 min) (red) with the nucleus stained with
  Hoechst 33,342 (blue). Negative control cells were kept at 36 °C. Scale bars show
  20 μm and 10 μm (zoomed image).'
