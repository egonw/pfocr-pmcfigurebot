caption: Effects of apigetrin on HepG2 cells. (a) Structure of apigetrin. (b) The
  cell viability effect of apigetrin on HepG2 and THEL2 cells at 48 h was measured
  by MTT assay with indicated concentrations (0, 25, 50, 100, and 200 µM) of apigetrin.
  The data are presented as the mean ± standard error of mean (SEM). ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001. (c) Morphological observations were made under a light microscope.
