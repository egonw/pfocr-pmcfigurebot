caption: 'Identification of DEGs in the breast cancer patients of the GSE59733 dataset
  and the functional analysis of the overlapping DEGs between the GSE59732 dataset
  and GSE59733 dataset. (A) Volcano plots showing 585 DEGs in the tumor samples of
  breast cancer patients pre- and post- radiotherapy. Red and blue dots represent
  the up-regulated and down-regulated genes based on an adjusted p < 0.05 and |log
  2(FC)| > 1. Black dots: no significant change. (B) Metascape analysis of the enriched
  pathways of above 585 DEGs. (C) Venn diagrams of DEGs in MCF-7 and ZR751 cell lines
  from GSE59732 dataset and breast cancer patients from GSE59733 dataset. A total
  of 5 intersecting genes (GDF15, IFIT1, CDKN1A, FAS, BTG2) were screened out and
  were all up-regulated. (D) The PPI network of these 5 DEGs and their related genes,
  created by the online tool STRING. (E) The biological pathways of DEGs were analyzed
  by the FunRich and showed as a bar chart (left) and pie chart (right), respectively.
  In the bar chart, the upper x-axis represents the p-value (âˆ’log10), and the lower
  x-axis represents the percentage of genes (blue). The y-axis represents the GO terms.
  Yellow represents the reference p-value 0.05, and red represents the specific p-value.
  The longer the rectangular zone, the smaller the p-value is. In the pie chart, each
  color represents a signaling pathway, and the proportion of DEGs participating in
  each signaling pathway in the 5 total DEGS showed in the form of the percentage.'
