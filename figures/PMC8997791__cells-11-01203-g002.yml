caption: 'Role of protein kinase pathways in interplay between Nrf2 signaling and
  autophagy. Abbreviations: ROS—reactive oxygen species, AMPK—AMP-activated protein
  kinase, ERK—extracellular signal-regulated kinase, PI3K/Akt—phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase/Akt kinase, JNK—c-Jun N-terminal kinase, TAK1—TGF-β-activated kinase 1,
  ULK—Unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase, mTOR—mammalian target of rapamycin,
  LC3II—microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II, UBA domain—ubiquitin-associated
  domain, KIR domain—KEAP1 interacting region, LIR domain—(LC3)-interacting region,
  Keap1—kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1, Nrf2—nuclear factor erythroid 2-related
  factor 2, ARE—antioxidant response element, Atg— AuTophaGy-related proteins. Red
  color represents components of redox signaling. Blue color represents protein kinases
  affecting Nrf2 and autophagy. Green color represents components of Nrf2 signaling
  pathway. Yellow color represents components of autophagy pathway. Dashed line arrows
  represent the connection/fusion between the two components. Details are provided
  in the text.'
