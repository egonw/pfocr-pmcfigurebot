caption: Bubble plot depicting results of metabolic pathway enrichment analysis enclosed
  with the number of up-regulated/down-regulated metabolites in each pathway. Asterisk
  indicates the global and overview maps. Rich factor is the ratio of metabolite numbers
  enriched in the pathway term to all metabolite numbers annotated in that pathway
  term. The greater the rich factor, the greater the degree of pathway enrichment.
  Adjusted p-value is the corrected p-value by false discovery rate (FDR), and a lower
  value indicates a greater pathway enrichment. The figures out of brackets represent
  the number of metabolites in a pathway, including metabolites related to the enzymes
  within a pathway, even if they are not in the original definition of the KEGG pathways;
  the figures in brackets represent the number of metabolites directly included in
  a pathway.
