figure_title: Flux balance analysis with Optknock implicates pathways involved in
  nucleotide synthesis in having the most frequent effect on ATPsyn and biomass
caption: A) The frequency of pathways in which genes removed by OptKnock increases
  the ratio of ATPsyn/biomass above wildtype. Each gene removed was assigned to a
  corresponding pathway as determined using EcoCyc. The percentage of the top 20 pathways
  is shown. Blue text indicates pathways involved in nucleotide synthesis. Parameters
  for FBA in .B) Average ATPsyn/biomass values for the top 20 pathways with the greatest
  ATPsyn/biomass values. Purple text indicates pathways involved in nucleotide synthesis.
article_title: Purine and pyrimidine synthesis differently affect the strength of
  the inoculum effect for aminoglycoside and Î²-lactam antibiotics.
