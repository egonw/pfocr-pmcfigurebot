caption: Circ‐EIF3I was highly expressed in LC and was associated with poor prognosis
  of LC patients. (a) The 10 differentially expressed circRNA screened in five paired
  LC tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues in GEO database (GSE101586) were shown.
  (b) Circ‐EIF3I expression in 36 paired LC tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues
  was detected using qRT‐PCR. (c) qRT‐PCR was used to measure the expression of circ‐EIF3I
  in HBE cells and four LC cells (H1650, H460, A549 and H1299). (d) Circ‐EIF3I expression
  in the tumor tissues of LC patients in stage III and stages I + II was determined
  using qRT‐PCR. (e) qRT‐PCR was used to assess circ‐EIF3I expression in LC patients
  with or without lymph node metastasis. (f) Kaplan–Meier analysis was performed to
  analyze the relationship between the overall survival rate of LC patients and circ‐EIF3I
  expression. (g), (h) RNase R assay was used to assess the stability of circ‐EIF3I
  in A549 and H1299 cells. *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.LC, lung cancer;
