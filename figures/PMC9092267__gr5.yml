caption: 'Impacts of variants on the dynamics of β-catenin and DVL3(A) Pull-down assay
  from HeLa total protein extracts indicates reduced interaction of endogenous β-catenin
  with mutant (NP_001311.3; p.Asp32His) GST-tagged CK2β as compared with wild type.
  GST serves as negative control. Bands of approximately 85 kDa of β-catenin were
  observed on western blot after probing with rabbit monoclonal β-catenin antibody.
  GST-fused proteins were visualized by probing the membrane with in-house-generated
  mouse monoclonal GST antibody.(B) Pull-down assay shows reduced interaction of DVL3
  with GST-fused CK2β mutant (NP_001311.3; p.Asp32His) as compared with wild-type.
  GST was used as negative control. Bands of approximately 78 kDa of DVL3 were observed
  by rabbit monoclonal DVL3 antibody.(C) Immunofluorescence shows decreased amount
  of active β-catenin (red) in nuclei of CK2β: NP_001311.3; p.Asp32His (left panel)
  and CK2β: NP_001311.3; p.Asp32Asn (right panel) LCLs as compared with the wild type.
  Localization pattern of non-active β-catenin (green) remains the same in wild-type
  and both mutant LCLs. DAPI (blue) indicates staining of nucleus. Scale bar, 5 μm
  (left panel); 10 μm (right panel).(D) Graph showing reduced kinase activity of CK2
  carrying mutants (NP_001311.3; p.Asp32His and NP_001311.3; p.Asp32Asn) of CK2β as
  compared with wild type measured by ADP-Glo assay. Note that β-catenin was used
  as substrate. Error bars represent SD; n = 3. ∗∗p ≤ 0.01 (Student’s t test).'
