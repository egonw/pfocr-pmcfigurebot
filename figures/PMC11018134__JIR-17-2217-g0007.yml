caption: Potential mechanisms by which FBL promotes cellular inflammatory injury.
  FBL is positively regulated by the upstream RAS/MAPK signaling pathway, and FBL
  further promotes cellular inflammatory responses and cellular injury by upregulating
  important target genes related to the NF-kB signaling pathway. The signaling pathway
  upstream of FBL is indicated by the green solid line, and downstream regulatory
  molecules are indicated by the red solid line.
