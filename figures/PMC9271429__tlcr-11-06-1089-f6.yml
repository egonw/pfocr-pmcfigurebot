caption: 'The effect of STT3A inhibition on the progression of LUAD was verified in
  vivo. (A-C) STT3A knockout inhibited xenograft tumor formation in vivo. Representative
  xenograft tumor images (A), tumor weight (B), tumor volume (C) and body weight (D).
  (E) Representative IHC staining of STT3A, EGFR, and Ki67 for indicated xenograft
  tumors. Quantification data were also indicated. Scale bar: 50 µm. Mice were treated
  with the STT3A inhibitor NGI-1 and compared to a placebo group (7 mice for each
  group). (F-I) NGI-1 inhibited xenograft tumor formation in vivo. Representative
  xenograft tumor images (F), tumor weight (G), tumor volume (H) and body weight (I).
  The data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation according to the Student’s
  t-test. **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.001. LUAD, lung adenocarcinoma; sgNC, small guide RNA
  negative control; sgSTT3A, small guide RNA of STT3A; IHC, immunohistochemistry.'
