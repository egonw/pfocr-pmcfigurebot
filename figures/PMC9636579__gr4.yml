caption: 'Proteome-wide identification of ADP-ribosylation mediated signaling in response
  to rucaparib in BRCA1-isogenic OC cells.A, schematic illustrating the experimental
  workflow for identification of ADP-ribosylated proteins. UWB and UWB+B cells were
  treated with rucaparib (10 μM) for 1 h compared with DMSO and metabolically labeled
  with a mix of 6YnAd/2YnAd (0.5 mM each) for 1 h before harvest, click chemistry,
  affinity pull down, and label-free quantitative MS analysis. 6YnAd: 6-alkyne adenosine.
  2YnAd: 2-alkyne adenosine. B, 6YnAd and 2YnAd probe structures and qualitative assessment
  of 6Yn/2YnAd labeling in UWB and UWB+B cells by in-gel fluorescence scanning. Lane
  1, 4: DMSO control; lanes 2, 5: A mix of 6Yn/2Yn-adenosine (0.5 mM each); lane 3:
  empty. The image is representative of at least two biological replicates. C, volcano
  plots indicating differential log2 responses in the level of ADP-ribosylation of
  endogenous proteins to 10 μM rucaparib in UWB (left) and UWB+B cells (right). D,
  KEGG and Reactome pathway analysis of significantly modulated proteins upon rucaparib
  treatment. E, Western blot analysis of eluates from immunoprecipitation (IP) with
  IgG, AKT antibodies. UWB and UWB+B cells were treated with 10 μM rucaparib for 1 h
  and subjected to co-IP, followed by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies
  (left) and quantification of AKT PARylation (right). The Western blot image is representative
  of three biological replicates. Data are represented as mean ± SD (indicated by
  the error bars). Each dot represents a biological replicate. ∗p < 0.05 as determined
  by Student’s t test. DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; OC, ovarian cancer.'
