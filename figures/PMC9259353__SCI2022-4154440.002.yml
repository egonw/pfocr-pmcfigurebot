caption: 'DA does not influence the apoptosis and proliferation of rBMSCs. (a) rBMSCs
  were treated with different concentrations of DA for 2 days. Flow cytometric analysis
  of apoptosis using Annexin V-FITC/PI staining. (b) Apoptosis rate analysis. (c)
  Effect of DA on the proliferation of rBMSCs for 1, 3, 5, and 7 days evaluated by
  CCK-8 assay. (d) Effect of DA on the proliferation of rBMSCs for 1 day evaluated
  by EdU assay. Proliferating nuclei were labeled with EdU (green), and the nuclei
  of all cells were labeled with Hoechst (blue). (e) The cell proliferation ratio
  of the indicated groups was expressed as the ratio of EdU-positive cells to total
  Hoechst-positive cells. Scale bar, 100 μm. ns: no significance.'
