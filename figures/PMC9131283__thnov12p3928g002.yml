caption: 'Deletion of 5-HT2B inhibits the TGF-β signaling pathway and enhances the
  inflammatory response. (A) Schematic overview of the AOM/DSS model of acute colitis
  in mice. (B) Body weight of WT (n = 8) and Htr2bΔIEC (n = 8) mice during AOM/DSS
  treatment. (C) The colon length and colitis severity score of WT and Htr2bΔIEC mice
  (n = 6-8) with acute colitis. (D) H&E staining of colon sections from WT and Htr2bΔIEC
  mice with acute colitis on day 15. (E) Proinflammatory cytokine mRNA levels (n =
  3) in whole colonic mucosa specimens from WT and Htr2bΔIEC mice. (F) Levels of total
  protein and phosphorylated JunD, SMAD2, and SMAD3 in the colonic epithelium of WT
  and Htr2bΔIEC mice. (G) SMAD4 protein levels in the colonic epithelium of WT and
  Htr2bΔIEC mice. (H) Levels of total protein and phosphorylated ERK in the colonic
  epithelium of WT and Htr2bΔIEC mice. (I) Levels of total protein and phosphorylated
  STAT3 in the colonic epithelium of WT and Htr2bΔIEC mice. Scale bars, 100 μm. Error
  bars represent the mean ± SEM. ns: not significant, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P
  < 0.001; Two-way ANOVA (B), unpaired Student''s t-test (C) and One-way ANOVA (E).'
