caption: Relationships between metabolites and gene expression levels. a Co-expression
  network of diosgenin saponin biosynthetic pathway genes. Pathway genes with a Pearson
  correlation coefficient >.9 (P ≤ .01) are displayed on the network. Genes marked
  in gray, green, and salmon represent genes in the pathways of squalene synthesis,
  sterol synthesis, and diosgenin and diosgenin saponin synthesis, respectively. b
  Expression profiles of genes involved in diosgenin saponin biosynthesis in 13 Dioscorea
  species, with pathway genes shown in columns. The left panel is the phylogeny of
  13 Dioscorea species. Expression data are plotted as log2 values. c Correlation
  analysis of gene expression with the contents of diosgenin, furostanol-type saponins,
  and spirostanol-type saponins. The horizontal axis of the bubble plot shows the
  Pearson’s correlation coefficients, and the vertical axis represents the P value.
  Circle sizes correspond to the value of Pearson’s correlation coefficient. The significance
  thresholds of correlations among the pathway genes are set at Pearson’s correlation
  coefficient value >.8 and P-value <.05.
article_title: The genome of Dioscorea zingiberensis sheds light on the biosynthesis,
  origin and evolution of the medicinally important diosgenin saponins.
