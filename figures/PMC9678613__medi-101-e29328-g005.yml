caption: Effects of baicalin treatment on the relative expression of genes involved
  in the TGF-β pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells evaluated by western blot analysis. MDA-MB-231
  cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of baicalin for 24 h. The protein-level
  expression of TGF-β, ZEB1, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin was determined by western
  blot analysis. β-actin was used as the internal control. Images are representative
  of three independent experiments.

  via the TGF-β/lncRNA-MALAT1/miR-200c signaling pathway.
