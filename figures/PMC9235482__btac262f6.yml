caption: Gene expression in S and real samples and the GO enrichment pathway in primary
  and metastases (a) Violin plot for L1 loss of profile matrix S and single-cell samples,
  (b) correlation between S and average gene expression profiles ( scale) in single-cell
  samples, (c) Top GO enrichment pathway changes in primary (P) and two bone metastases
  (BM1 and BM2) with α = 0.05 for Holm-corrected P values. Text preceded by up arrows
  indicates up-regulated pathways whereas text preceded by down arrows indicates down-regulated
  pathways
