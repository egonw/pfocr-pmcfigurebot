caption: 'Role of GOLM1 in protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum in hepatocellular
  carcinoma (HCC). (a) Regulatory network view of GOLM1, pivot genes, pathway genes,
  and the protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum pathway. Red represents
  upregulated gene expression, and blue represents downregulated gene expression.
  (b) Molecular docking studies of E2F1 and IGF2BP3 with GOLM1. (c) GSVA score of
  the 13 prognostic genes. (d) Multivariate Cox regression analysis. (e) Establishment
  of the LASSO regression model. (f) The random forest regression model identified
  11 signature genes associated with survival. (g) The timeROC curve analysis of median
  survival and survival rates at one, three, five, and eight years for the above four
  models in TCGA. (h) Performance validation of the optimal random forest regression
  model in the TCGA training set. AUC: area under the receiver operating characteristic
  curve; GSVA: gene set enrichment analysis; LASSO: least absolute shrinkage and selection
  operator regression; RandomForestSRC: fast unified random forests for survival,
  regression, and classification.'
