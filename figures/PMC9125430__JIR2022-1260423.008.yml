caption: Overexpression of TP53INP2 promoted cell apoptosis in ccRCC cell lines. (a)–(d)
  Apoptosis rates of 786-O, ACHN, and A498 cell were detected by flow cytometry after
  overexpressing TP53INP2. (e)–(h) Levels of proapoptotic protein cleaved caspase-3,
  cleaved caspase-8, and cleaved PARP were measured by a way of western blot. Data
  are presented as mean ± SD of three or four independent experiments. ∗P < 0.05;
  ∗∗P < 0.01.
