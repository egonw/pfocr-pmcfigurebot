caption: a, Schematic of scFIND-seq applied to Aqp4+Edem1+ astrocytes in EAE. b, Uniform
  manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) plots of Aqp4+Edem1+ and Aqp4+Edem1−
  astrocytes from naive and EAE mice analysed by scFIND-seq. c, Analysis of marker
  genes in Aqp4+Edem1+ or Aqp4+Edem1− astrocytes from naive and EAE mice. d, Pathway
  analysis of cluster 1 astrocytes analysed by scFIND-seq using IPA. Fisher’s exact
  test. e, In vivo knockdown of Nr3c2 in astrocytes. Top, schematic of the lentiviral
  vector containing sgRNA targeting Nr3c2 and Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 under the
  control of a Gfap promoter. Bottom, EAE disease progression in mice transduced with
  sgScrmbl (n = 14) or sgNr3c2 (n = 7) lentiviruses. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA.
  f, Quantitative PCR with reverse transcription Il1b, Il6 and Ccl2 after 24 h and
  Xbp1 after 4 h in primary mouse astrocytes treated with or without 1 ng ml−1 IL-1β
  and TNF in the presence of 1 μM finerenone or vehicle. n = 5 per group. Unpaired
  two-sided t-test. g, Left, heat map of RNA-seq data from of astrocytes isolated
  from sgScrmbl and sgNr3c2 mice. n = 3 per group. Right, GSEA pre-ranked analysis
  of RNA-seq data comparing astrocytes isolated from sgNr3c2 versus sgScrmbl mice.
  h, FACS analysis of spliced XBP1 (XBP1S+) in astrocytes from sgScrmbl and sgNr3c2
  mice (n = 3 per group). Unpaired two-sided t-test. i, Left, prediction of decreased
  NCOR2 activation by IPA in cluster 1 scFIND-seq data compiled from all cells. Fisher’s
  exact test. Right, differential gene expression of candidate co-regulators of NR3C2
  in sgNr3c2 versus sgScrmbl astrocytes showing Ncor2 as the top candidate. j, Analysis
  of EAE mice transduced with lentivirus co-expressing Gfap::Cas9 and sgNcor2 (n =
  9) or sgScrmbl (n = 9). Top, schematic of the lentiviral vector containing sgRNA
  targeting Ncor2 and S. pyogenes Cas9 under the control of a Gfap promoter. Bottom,
  disease progression in sgScrmbl versus sgNcor2 mice. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA.
  k, Heat map of RNA-seq data from astrocytes in sgScrmbl versus sgNcor2 mice. n =
  3 per group. l, GSEA pre-ranked analysis of scRNA-seq data in astrocytes from sgScrmbl
  versus sgNcor2 mice. Data are mean ± s.e.m.
