  in cell signaling
caption: (A) A diagram of the JNK signaling pathway featuring negative transcriptional
  and positive phosphorylation feedbacks.(B) Time course of the JNK activity response
  to JNK inhibition. A transient, prolonged period of reactivation and overshoot of
  the JNK activity occurs because of the delay in the negative feedback circuit of
  DUSP1 expression.(C) A signaling pathway that includes an integral control module
  consisting of two species Y1 and Y2, where Y1 activates the conversion of an inactive
  form  to active form (X1). Designations are the same as in .(D and E) Dose response
  (D) and time courses (E) of the output activity T show the lack of complete reactivation
  for this pathway.(F) A signaling pathway with an integral control module where Y1
  catalyzes the synthesis of the inactive kinase form, .(G and H) Dose responses (G)
  and time courses (H) of T to drug inhibition of X1 and X2 (blue lines), the kinases
  downstream of X2, including output T (orange), or the species in the control module
  (green). See  for equations and parameters.
