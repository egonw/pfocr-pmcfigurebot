caption: The critical pathways screened by network pharmacology. (A) GO enrichment
  analysis. (B) KEGG enrichment analysis. Cellular senescence signaling pathways were
  enriched for the first time. (C) The five clusters screed by MCODE analysis. (D)
  Reactome pathway enrichment analysis of the cluster Ⅰ. The cellular senescence signaling
  pathway was again enriched. (E–F) The cellular senescence pathway and key markers
  (TP53/P53, CDKN1A/P21) on the pathway.
