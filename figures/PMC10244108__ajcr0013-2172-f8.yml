caption: 'CXCL17 elimination suppresses tumorigenesis via regulating IL-17 signaling
  pathway. A-C. Measurement of tumor volume and weight from subcutaneously injected
  xenograft model with or without CXCL17 silence upon IL-17 addition; D. HE staining
  was used to observe tumor pathological changes (Scale bars, 50 μm) with or without
  CXCL17 silence upon IL-17 addition; E. Immunohistochemistry was performed to assess
  CXCL17 expression (Scale bars, 50 μm) in tumor; F. Western-blot assay was applied
  to detect CXCL17 and receptor GPR35 expression in tissues. Compared with the siNC
  group, **P < 0.01; compared with the si-CXCL17 group, #P < 0.05; ##P < 0.01.'
article_title: Activation of the IL-17 signalling pathway by the CXCL17-GPR35 axis
  affects drug resistance and colorectal cancer tumorigenesis.
