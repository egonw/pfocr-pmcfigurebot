caption: CBX gene mutation and cancer pathway activity in ESCA (cBioPortal and GSCALite).
  (A and B) The alterations frequency of distinct CBX members in ESCA. CBXs were altered
  in 138 samples of 927 ESCA patients, accounting for 15%. (C) The role of CBXs in
  famous cancer-related pathways. CBXs = chromobox family members, ESCA = esophageal
  cancer.
