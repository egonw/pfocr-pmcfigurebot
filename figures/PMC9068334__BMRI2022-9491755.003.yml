caption: Aβ1-42-induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells was inhibited by baicalin treatment.
  SH-SY5Y cells were treated with 5 μM, 10 μM, and 20 μM baicalin for 24 h and analyzed
  by TUNEL fluorescence staining with a NIKON A1+ confocal microscope. The experiment
  was repeated twice. A total of 100 DAPI-positive nuclei were counted from three
  separate fields, and the percentage of apoptosis was calculated based on the number
  of TUNEL-positive nuclei in each field. The TUNEL-positive rate is presented as
  the mean ± SD. N = 5; ∗ represents P < 0.05.
