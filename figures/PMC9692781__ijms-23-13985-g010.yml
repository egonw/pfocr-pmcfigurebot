caption: Survival and outgrowth of enriched TE-NSPs at 1-month post-implant in rat
  6-OHDA lesion model of PD. Representative confocal reconstructions of implanted
  enriched TE-NSPs at 1-month post-implant labeled via immunohistochemistry to denote
  GFP (GFP, green), dopaminergic neurons/axons (TH, red), and synapses (synapsin,
  purple). (a) Dopaminergic neurons within the aggregate region displayed healthy
  morphologies. (b) Dopaminergic neurites maintained healthy projections longitudinally
  within the tube. (c,d) TE-NSP neurons exhibited neurite outgrowth into the host
  SNpc from the aggregate region. In these instances, regions containing outgrowth
  displayed concentrated synapsin labeling. (e) TE-NSPs also exhibited neurite outgrowth
  into the host striatum from the axonal region. In these instances, thin neurites
  were observed, projecting from areas of dense TH labeling within the end of the
  tube; note, in this example, the micro-column is autofluorescing green. Scale bar
  (a,b) = 25 µm. Scale bar (c) = 50 µm. Scale bar (d,e) = 25 µm.
