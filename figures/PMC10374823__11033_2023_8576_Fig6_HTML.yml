caption: The differentially m6A-modified mRNA network in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis
  and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathways. (a) The interaction network
  of differentially m6A-modified mRNA in the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway
  and in protein processing of endoplasmic reticulum pathways. The genes shown in
  red are m6A hypermethylated genes and those shown in green are m6A hypomethylated
  genes. Genes showed in blue can interact with m6A differentially expressed genes,
  not m6A differentially expressed genes in MeRIP-seq data. The remaining genes represent
  the top 10 genes calculated by the number of nodes in the interaction network of
  differentially m6A-modified mRNA in the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway and
  in protein processing of the endoplasmic reticulum pathway. (b, c) Sect.Â 63 and
  Ube2o transcripts in the UCB and control groups. Input and IP m6A are displayed
  as blue and red, respectively
