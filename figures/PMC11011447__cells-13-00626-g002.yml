caption: 'Smad4kera-cko revealed a larger cornea with enlarged Anterior Chamber under
  normal IOP reading. (A,D) Cornea Radius measurement indicating significance difference
  between Smad4kera-cko and Smad4Ctrl at P42 (n = 6, ****, p < 0.0001). (Aâ€“C) Anterior
  chamber measurement using the distance between lens and cornea showed longer distances
  in Smad4kera-cko compared to those in Smad4Ctrl (n = 6, *, p = 0.0133). (E) IOP
  measurement using iCare Tonolab exhibited no significant difference between Smad4kera-cko
  and Smad4Ctrl (n = 6, ns). Abbreviation: ns, not significant.'
