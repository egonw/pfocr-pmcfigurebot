caption: Pathway enrichment analysis for CHAC2. (A) Pathway enrichment analysis of
  all genes associated with the mRNA expression levels of CHAC2. (B) Pathway enrichment
  analysis of genes positively correlated with the mRNA expression level of CHAC2.
  (C) Pathway enrichment analysis of genes negatively correlated with the mRNA expression
  level of CHAC2. (D) Heatmap analysis of cell cycle pathways in Figure B. (E) The
  interacting proteins of CHAC2 were analyzed in the STRING database.
