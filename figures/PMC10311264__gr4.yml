caption: STAT1 expression level, phosphorylation status and its homodimer formation
  in FMDV 3Cpro-expressing cells after IFN-γ stimulation. A HeLa cells transfected
  with pXJ41 or pXJ41-3C were treated with 100 ​ng/mL human IFN-γ for 1 ​h at 24 ​h
  after transfection and collected for Western blotting with antibody against STAT1
  (top panel), phospho-STAT1 (STAT1-Y701, panel 2) or HA (panel 3), respectively.
  Antibody against β-actin (bottom panel) was used as a protein loading control. B
  Densitometric analysis of the digital image in (A). Intensities of the band were
  normalized with that of β-actin. C Cells transfected with pXJ41 or pXJ41-3C were
  treated with human 100 ​ng/mL IFN-γ for 1 ​h at 24 ​h post-transfection. Samples
  were lysed and subjected to native-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibody against
  STAT1 (top panel). Expression of 3Cpro was detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting
  with antibody against HA (panel 2), with β-actin as a loading control (bottom panel).
  D Densitometric analysis of the digital image in (C). Intensities of the band were
  normalized with that of β-actin. Data represent the mean ​± ​the standard deviations
  (error bars) of three independent experiments.
