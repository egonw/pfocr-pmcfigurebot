caption: Inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway reversed the down-regulation of
  FoxO1 expression in MDSCs and macrophages stimulated by R848 Bone marrow cells cultured
  in a medium supplemented with 40 ng/mL IL-6 and 40 ng/mL GM-CSF for 4 days. R848
  is used to simulate lupus in vitro. INK128, rapamycin and metformin are used to
  block the mTOR signaling pathway. (A) The median fluorescence intensity of FoxO1
  in different cell subpopulations was determined by FACS. (B) The statistical results
  of the median fluorescence intensity of MDSCs. (C) The statistical results of the
  median fluorescence intensity of macrophages. MDSCs represent myeloid-derived suppressor
  cells. FACS represents fluorescent-activated cell sorting. Data represent the mean
  scores ±SEM. *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001.
