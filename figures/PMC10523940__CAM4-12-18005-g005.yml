caption: ALK mutation did not affect the prognosis of NSCLC BM+ patients and the expressions
  of hsa_circ_0072309, miR‐100, and ACKR3 mRNAs and ACKR3 protein in serum. (A, B)
  The roles of ALK mutation on post‐operative OS and PFS of NSCLC BM+ patients, respectively.
  (C–F) The influences of ALK mutation on serum hsa_circ_0072309, miR‐100, and ACKR3
  mRNA levels, and ACKR3 protein level in NSCLC BM+ patients.
article_title: Circulating hsa_circ_0072309, acting via the miR‐100/ACKR3 pathway,
  maybe a potential biomarker for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of brain
  metastasis from non‐small‐cell lung cancer.
