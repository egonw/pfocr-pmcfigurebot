figure_title: Pldo does not affect the core Fz/PCP pathway
caption: Asymmetric Flamingo (Fmi) localization, as a proxy for Fz/PCP signaling,
  is shown. Note that it is not affected in pldo-mutant cells, as compared with surrounding
  control wt cells, in pupal wings (as shown in the graphs). Clones of mutant cells
  were generated by the MARCM technique, with mutant cells marked with GFP (green).
  Polarity strength lines of Fmi staining are shown as orange lines. Six different
  individuals were used, and around 100 cells were analyzed in each case. Scale bar
  represents 100 Î¼m.
