caption: Inflammatory response was involved in burn-induced ALI. (a) MPO immunohistochemical
  staining in burn injury (24 h and 48 h) and control rat, scale bar = 50 μm. (b)
  Quantitative analysis of MPO expression, ratio of (MPO+) = (MPO positive stained
  cell)/(all cells in each filed of scope) × 100%, **p < 0.01. (c) ELISA results of
  expression of IL-1β and TNF-α in burn injury rat serum (control, 6, 12, 24, 48,
  and 72 h), **p < 0.01. (d) PCR results of mRNA expression of inflammatory factors
  IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 in burn injury rat lung tissue (control, 6, 12, 24, 48, and
  72 h), **p < 0.01. ALI acute lung injury, PCR polymerase chain reaction, MPO Myeloperoxidase,
