caption: Network propagation and Reactome pathway analyses. (A,B) Network propagation
  from query sets consisting of the 9 eribulin UFGs (A) and the 13 vinorelbine UFGs
  (B) yielded the 100-gene networks shown, which included 7 of the 9 eribulin UFGs
  and all 13 of the vinorelbine UFGs; 2 eribulin UFGs, C5ORF38 and GPR157, were not
  themselves captured in the network propagation. Purple-highlighted network nodes
  represent original UFG query input genes. (Câ€“J) Reactome pathways derived from the
  100-gene query sets obtained from network propagation. Full Reactome maps are shown
  for eribulin (C) and vinorelbine (D), with blow ups of the Signal Transduction (E,F),
  Immune System (G,H) and Cell Cycle (I,J) islands shown for eribulin (E,G,I) and
  vinorelbine (F,H,J).
