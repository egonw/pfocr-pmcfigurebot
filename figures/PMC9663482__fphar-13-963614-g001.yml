caption: Quercetin inhibited the proliferation of glioblastoma cells in vitro. (A)
  The chemical structure of Quercetin. (B–D) Three glioma cell lines U87MG, CHG-5
  and T98 were treated with various concentrations of Quercetin for 24 and 48 h, respectively,
  then the cell viability was measured with CCK-8. (E) Cytotoxic effects of quercetin.
  Normal mouse astrocytes were treated with various concentrations of quercetin for
  24 and 48 h, then the cell viability was measured with CCK-8. (F) Quercetin IC50
  values for glioma cell lines. All data are shown as the mean ± SD of six experiments.
  * p＜0.05, **p＜0.01 or *** p＜0.001 vs. control group.
