caption: Analysis of macrophages in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The overall survival
  of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was assessed based on the expression of CD163,
  which is an M2-like macrophage marker. High expression was associated with a poor
  prognosis of the patients. Then, a proteinâ€“protein functional network association
  analysis was performed using the macrophage markers of CD68 (pan-macrophages), CD16
  (M1-like macrophages), CD163 (M2-like), PTX3 (M2c-like), and MITF (M2-like), and
  the regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs) marker of FOXP3. The network created a macrophage
  pathway that was subsequently applied to a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA).
  The GSEA confirmed the association of the macrophage pathway with the high-risk
  group, which was characterized by poor overall survival and high CD163-positive
  macrophages.
