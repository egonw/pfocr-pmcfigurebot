caption: Schematic overview of polydatin activity on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway
  with different strategies for inhibition. PD induces apoptosis in cancer cells through
  the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and protects against inflammatory damage, as
  well as inhibiting cell proliferation, survival and protein synthesis through protein
  phosphorylation.
