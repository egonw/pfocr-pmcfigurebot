caption: MALAT1 downregulation distinctly inhibited OS cell proliferation and migration.
  (a) Cell apoptosis in Saos-2 and U2OS cell lines after infection with sh-MALAT1,
  detected by flow cytometry. (b) Cell migration in Saos-2 and U2OS cell lines after
  infection with sh-MALAT1, measured using the transwell migration assay. (c) Cell
  migration in Saos-2 and U2OS cell lines after infection with sh-MALAT1, measured
  using the scratch wound assay. (d) Cell proliferation in Saos-2 and U2OS cell lines
  after infection with sh-MALAT1, analyzed using the CCK-8 assay. (e) Cell cycle in
  Saos-2 and U2OS cell lines after infection with sh-MALAT1, detected by flow cytometry.
  State n = 3. ∗P < 0.05.
