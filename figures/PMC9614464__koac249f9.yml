caption: Erucic acid TAG biosynthesis pathway. A, Visualization of the processes of
  fatty acid synthesis, elongation, TAG assembly, and fatty acid recycling made using
  BioRender (B) Relative expression of genes involved in erucic acid biosynthesis.
  The relative transcript abundances of genes involved in erucic acid biosynthesis
  are visualized as heat maps. The x-axes of the heat maps describe either the tissue
  or heat stress time point for which the RNA was extracted and the y-axis provides
  the gene IDs. MCAT, malonyl-CoA ACP S-malonyltransferase; KAS, β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase;
  KAR, β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase; HAD, β-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydrase; ENR, enoyl-ACP
  reductase; SAD, stearoyl-ACP Δ9-desaturase; FAT A, fatty acyl-ACP thioesterase A;
  LACS, long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase; ACC2, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2; KCS, β-ketoacyl-CoA
  synthase; HCD, β-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrase; ECR, enoyl-CoA reductase; G3P, glycerol-3-phosphate;
  GPAT, glycerol phosphate acyltransferase; LPAT, lysophosphatidyl acyltransferase;
  PAP, phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase; DGAT, diacylglycerol acyltransferase.
