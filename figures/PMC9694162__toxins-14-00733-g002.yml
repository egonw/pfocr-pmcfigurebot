caption: Effects of RSV on ZEA-induced apoptosis of TM4 cells. TM4 cells were seeded
  into six-well plates and exposed to ZEA (20 μmol·L−1) for 24 h after pretreatment
  with RSV (2.5 μmol·L−1) for 3 h. (A) JC-1 staining of TM4 cells (100× magnification).
  TM4 cells were incubated with JC-1 (10 μg/mL) for 30 min at 37 °C and the MMP levels
  were analyzed by flow cytometry. A higher ratio of green/red fluorescence indicates
  decreased MMP. (B) Flow cytometry analysis of TM4 cell apoptosis. Cells were collected
  and treated with 5 μL of Annexin V-FITC and 5 μL of PI, and then incubated in the
  dark for 20 min at 25 °C. (C) Activity of caspase-3 in TM4 cells was measured using
  an active caspase-3 staining kit and detected by flow cytometry. (D) The apoptosis-related
  protein levels of cleaved PARP, cleaved caspase-3, and Bax/Bcl-2 in TM4 cells. Different
  letters (a, b, c) represent a significant difference (p < 0.05 calculated by ANOVA
  for each group), while the same letters indicate no significant difference between
  groups.
