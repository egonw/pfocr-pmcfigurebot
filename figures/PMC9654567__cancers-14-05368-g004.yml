caption: SUN5 regulated the level of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in colorectal cancer. (A)
  Scattered map of upregulated (red) and downregulated (green) genes positioned away
  from unchanged genes (gray). (B) Heatmap of DEGs comparing control and SUN5-OE group.
  (C) GO enrichment analysis of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological
  processes of DEGs comparing control and SUN5-OE group. (D) KEGG analysis showed
  that the proteins encoded by these DEGs were involved in multiple signaling pathways.
  (E) Six genes, including CCNA2, CD164, CDKN1A, CKAP2, EGR1 and RAD21, were identified
  by RT-qPCR to verify the creditability of the sequencing (Student′s t-test, n =
  3. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001). (F) ERK1/2 and the phosphorylation
  of ERK1/2 were determined by Western blotting after overexpression and knockdown
  of SUN5 in LoVo and DLD-1 cells (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01; “ns” indicates not significantly
  different).
