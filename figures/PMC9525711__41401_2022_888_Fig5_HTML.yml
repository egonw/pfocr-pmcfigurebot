figure_title: TLB inhibits Aβ25-35-induced cytotoxicity in BV2 cells via targeting
  HMGB1 through SIRT3/SOD2/mtROS signaling pathway
caption: 'BV2 cells were treated with or without TLB (12.5, 25, 50 μM) or its analog
  (50 μM) for 48 h after Aβ25-35 insults. a Cell viability (n = 6). b LDH level (n = 6).
  c IL-1β level (n = 6). d IL-6 level (n = 6). e TNF-α level (n = 6). f Representative
  Western blot for HMGB1 in cytoplasm. g Quantification of HMGB1 in cytoplasm (n = 5).
  h Representative Western blot for HMGB1 in nucleus. i Quantification of HMGB1 in
  nucleus (n = 5). j Representative Western blots for TLR4, MyD88, TRAF6 and p-NF-κBp65
  in BV2 cells. k Quantification of TLR4, MyD88, TRAF6 and p-NF-κBp65 in BV2 cells
  (n = 5). l mtROS generation was detected using flow cytometer after staining with
  Mito-SOX. m The percentages of Mito-SOX-positive cells analyzed using a flow analysis
  software (n = 5). n Representative Western blots for SIRT3, ac-SOD2 and SOD2. o
  Quantification of SIRT3 and ac-SOD2 (n = 5). p OCR was measured using Seahorse to
  determine the mitochondrial function. q Quantification of OCR. r HMGB1-OE BV2 cells
  were generated using lentivirus (n = 6). Treatment with or without 50 μM TLB for
  48 h after Aβ25-35 insults in WT and HMGB1-OE BV2 cells. s Cell viability (n = 6).
  t LDH level (n = 6). u HMGB1 level. v NF-κBp65 binding activity (n = 6). The data
  were presented as the mean ± SEM. **P < 0.01 vs. control group (WT); #P < 0.05,
  ##P < 0.01 vs. Aβ25-35 group (WT); ††P < 0.01 vs. control group (HMGB1-OE); §P < 0.01
  vs. Aβ25-35 group (HMGB1-OE).'
