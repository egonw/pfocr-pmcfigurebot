caption: Gene set enrichment analysis for highly contributing CpGs. Each PC’s ranked
  CpG weights were translated to genes according to annotations, and pathway enrichment
  analysis was run for each PC. Here, the sparse consensus network of enriched curated
  GO and REAC terms across the 15 PCs is visualized. Annotated clusters of significant
  pathway similarities and high weights are labeled (5), along with the genes enriched
  within that group beyond the rest of the network. Each node is colored according
  to the enrichment score of that term, from PC1 (yellow) to PC15 (dark purple) according
  to the viridis color palette, with more color slices demonstrating enrichment across
  more PCs.
