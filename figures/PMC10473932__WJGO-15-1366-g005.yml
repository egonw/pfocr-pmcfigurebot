caption: 'Expression of myristoylated alanine rich protein kinase C substrate in gastric
  cancer cells and changes after knocking down LINC01268. A: After transfection with
  sh-LINC01268, the expression of LINC01268 in MGC80-3 and AGS decreased significantly;
  B: The relative expression levels of myristoylated alanine rich protein kinase C
  substrate (MARCKS) mRNA in gastric cancer cell lines MGC80-3 and AGS were higher
  than that in GES-1; C: After down-regulating the expression of LINC01268 in MGC80-3
  and AGS, the expression level of MARCKS mRNA was significantly reduced. Expression
  levels were normalized to GAPDH levels. The results were shown as the mean Â± SD.
  aP < 0.05, cP < 0.001, dP < 0.0001. MARCKS: Myristoylated alanine rich protein kinase
  C substrate; sh-NC: sh-negative control.'

  metastasis of gastric cancer via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and targeting MARCKS.
