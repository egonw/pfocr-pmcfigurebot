caption: 'Intravenous (IV) Cortical Biodistribution Data. At equal dose, the tissue
  penetration of the parent IgG1 antibody administered via the rat tail vein was an
  order of magnitude lower than when administered intra-CSF. Representative images.
  (a) Upon IV delivery of ABT-806 at 0.3 mg/kg (same dose as administered intra-CSF),
  the parent antibody was barely detectable in the brain tissue, both within 4 h and
  24 h post-injection. Within 4 h of tail vein injection at 3 mg/kg (10-times higher
  than administered intra-CSF), ABT-806 was observed in trace amounts in the brain
  tissue. Even at 10 mg/kg, (~30-fold higher than administered intra-CSF), IV-delivered
  ABT-806 resulted in low penetration in brain tissue, consistent with a poorly permeable
  blood-brain barrier (BBB). Blue = DAPI, Red = ABT-806. (b) Quantification of the
  fluorescence intensity (vasculature excluded) displays a dose-response relationship
  which is also time-dependent. 0.3 mg/kg 4 h: 979.1 ± 51; 0.3 mg/kg 24 h: 2085 ±
  163; 3 mg/kg 4 h: 3166 ± 180; 3 mg/kg 24 h: 5452 ± 452; 10 mg/kg 4 h: 8663 ± 272;
  10 mg/kg 24 h: 11155 ± 292. **** p < 0.0001 vs. 0.3 mg/kg at that timepoint, ++++
  p < 0.0001 vs. 3 mg/kg at that timepoint, #### p < 0.0001 vs. same dose at 4 h;
  One-way ANOVA, Tukey’s post-hoc test. n = 3 animals per timepoint, average of 20–25
  slices per animal per timepoint. (c) The IHC observation and quantification are
  consistent with the results from the PK analysis of IV-administered brain homogenates
  that are summarized in the table. BQL = Below Quantification Limit. (d) Comparison
  of the fluorescence intensity between ICM and IV administered brains indicates an
  order of magnitude higher exposures with intra-CSF vs. systemic administration at
  0.3 mg/kg dose. **** p < 0.0001 vs. ICM at that timepoint; Two-way ANOVA, Tukey’s
  post-hoc test.'
