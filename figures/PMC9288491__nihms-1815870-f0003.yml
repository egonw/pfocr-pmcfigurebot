figure_title: Workflow of developing pharmacological tools for targeting the glioblastoma
  (GBM)-immune symbiosis
caption: Spatial tissue characterization and disease-specific analyses are critical
  for establishing the immune landscape of GBM patient tumors with different tumor
  origins, genetic statues, disease stages, and immunotherapeutic responses. The immune
  and genetic landscapes of specific GBM tumors can be determined via flow cytometry/fluorescence-activated
  cell sorting (FCM/FACS), single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), whole-exome seq,
  T cell receptor (TCR)-seq, and mass cytometry (CyTOF). Integration of these techniques
  could help identify and determine the relationships between GBM cell genetic statues
  and immune landscape, and their association with tumor progression and the effectiveness
  of immunotherapies. Unbiased profiling (e.g., scRNA-seq, RNA-seq, and microarray)
  and its associated pathway analysis followed by in vitro and in vivo functional
  studies are essential for validating which pathways and factors are crucial for
  the context-dependent GBM–immune crosstalk. Network pharmacological studies and
  molecular docking could help to identify novel therapeutic drug candidates, such
  as neutralizing antibodies (Abs) and small-molecule agonists/antagonists, for translational
  studies.
