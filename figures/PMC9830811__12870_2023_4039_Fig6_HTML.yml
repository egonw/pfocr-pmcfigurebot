caption: Effects of L-Kyn and 1-NAA on root system architecture (RSA) of primary maize
  roots under +P-Zn and -P-Zn. Inbred line B73 were grown in a hydroponic solution
  containing different combinations of P and Zn for 7 days. A Representative images
  of the primary roots of inbred line B73 treated with L-Kyn and 1-NAA under +P-Zn
  and -P-Zn. Scale bars = 1 cm. B Effects of L-Kyn and 1-NAA on the total length and
  density of 1° lateral roots of the primary root under +P-Zn and -P-Zn. Values are
  means ± SD (n = 12). C P and Zn concentrations in the roots. Values are means ±
  SD (n = 4). Means with the same letter are not significantly different at P < 0.05
