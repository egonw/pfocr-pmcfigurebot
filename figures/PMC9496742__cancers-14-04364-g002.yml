caption: 'Prognostic evaluation of candidate necroptosis−related lncRNAs. (A) Volcano
  plots presenting the expression data of the 1645 differentially expressed lncRNAs
  in CRC patients from the TCGA−COAD cohort. (B) Venn diagram depicting the common
  collections of differentially expressed lncRNAs (DEGs) and necroptosis−related lncRNAs
  (CORs). (C) Cox univariate regression analysis of 16 candidate necroptosis−related
  lncRNAs. Red squire: Hazard ratio > 1, Blue squire: Hazard Ratio < 1(D) Heatmap
  showing the correlation between the levels of the 16 prognostic necroptosis−related
  lncRNAs and 8 validated hub genes in the necroptosis pathway in CRC patients. The
  colour of the blocks shows the degree of correlation. * p value < 0.05, ** p value
  < 0.01, and *** p value < 0.001. (E) The Sankey diagram presents the detailed connection
  between necroptosis−related lncRNAs and necroptosis−related genes.'
