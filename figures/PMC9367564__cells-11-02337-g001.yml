caption: Regulation of bile acids (BA) metabolism. BAs are produced in the liver by
  modifying cholesterol with a series of CYP enzymes. The liver also produces taurine,
  which can be conjugated to BAs by BAL (BA CoA-ligase) and BAT (BA CoA:amino acid
  N-acyltransferase) enzymes. BAs secreted from the liver into the intestine undergo
  deconjugation and a series of modifications generating an array of secondary BAs.
  The deconjugated taurine is taken up by TauT and BAs by IBAT (ileal BA transporter)
  and OSTα-OSTβ (organic solute transporter α-β). Afterward, BAs are recirculated
  via entero-hepatic circulation and transported into the liver by NTCP (sodium-dependent
  taurocholate co-transporting peptide) and OATP (organic anion-transporting polypeptides).
  The presence of BAs activates their receptors. Upon stimulation, intestinal TGR5
  promotes GLP-1 (glucagon-like-peptide-1) and PYY (peptide-YY) production. At the
  same time, nuclear receptor FXR (farnesoid X receptor) regulates the expression
  of genes connected with BAs transport and signaling. One of FXR target proteins,
  FGF15 (fibroblast growth factor 15), transfers the signal of BAs abundance from
  the intestine to the liver. Consequently, it reduces BAs’ production and transport
  via JNK/ERK signaling pathway or together with SHP (small heterodimer partner).
  Additionally, hepatic FXR surveys for the levels of BAs and signals to adjust BAs’
  biosynthesis, conjugation, and transport.
