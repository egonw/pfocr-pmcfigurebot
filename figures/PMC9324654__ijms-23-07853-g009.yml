caption: CYP27C1 impacts inhibitory effect of picropodophyllin via IGF-1R/AKT/p53
  signaling pathway. (A,B) A549-shCYP27C1, H1975-shCYP27C1, and the corresponding
  control cells were seeded in 6-well plate for 24 h before treatment of PPP (100
  μM, 24 h). Protein samples were applied to perform immunoblot analysis after extraction
  and quantitation. Total Akt, phosphorylated Akt, p53, and β-actin were detected
  by immunoblot analysis using the corresponding antibodies. (C,D) Grey scales of
  the bands were measured by Gel-Pro ANALYZER, and analyzed by unpaired two-tailed
  T test. *, p < 0.05, **, p < 0.01, ***, p < 0.001, n.s., p > 0.05.
