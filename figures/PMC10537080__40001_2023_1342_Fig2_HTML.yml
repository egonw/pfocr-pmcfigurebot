caption: a Platelets protect CTCs within circulation. The platelet coat around CTCs
  physically shields them from NK cell attack. Moreover, platelets can transfer their
  MHC I molecules onto the membranes of CTCs. This allows CTCs to downregulate expression
  of their own MHC I molecules, evading T cell recognition without eliciting attack
  from NK cells through "missing self" recognition. Platelets can also impair NK cell
  recognition of CTCs via activation of NKG2D receptors. Platelets also promote association
  with NET to assist CTC distribution and adhesion. Through inducing the RhoA/YAP
  pathway, platelets promotes CTCs' resistance to apoptosis. b Through CD40/CD154
  interaction or release of microparticles, platelets prime endothelid cells for attachment.
  Platelets promote capture of CTCs by the endothelium and reduce rolling rate. Mediated
  by integrins platelets-CTC complex adhere to the endothelium. ATP-released platelets
  interact P2Y2 receptor endothelid cells ceasing opening endothelid bar.
