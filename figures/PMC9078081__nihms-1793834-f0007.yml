figure_title: The balance between Imd-Relish and JAK-STAT pathways determines the
  influence of microbes on ISC differentiation
caption: '(A and B) Activity of Imd-Relish (A) and JAK-STAT(B) pathways as reported
  by target gene (AttacinD [AttD] and DiptericinB [DptB] for Imd-Relish and Suppressor
  of cytokine signaling at 36E [Socs36E] for JAK-STAT) or activating ligand (Unpaired3
  [Upd3] for JAK-STAT) expression is low in the midgut of GF flies compared with CR
  counterparts. Oral ingestion of high-dose Atro or Lpla by GF flies triggers the
  Imd-Relish pathway but not JAK-STAT signaling, while Ecc15 induces both.(C) Escargot-specific
  imd overexpression results in a decline in EE density both in CR and GF animals.(D)
  Escargot-specific depletion of Relish has no effect on Ecc15-induced EE accumulation,
  while relish and imd overexpression suppress EE gain in response to Ecc15 infection.(E
  and F) Escargot-specific activation of JAK-STAT signaling by HopTuml highly increases
  EE density both in UC and Ecc15-infected flies.Statistical significance: mean values
  of at least 3 biological repeats are represented, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ****p <
  0.0001.'
