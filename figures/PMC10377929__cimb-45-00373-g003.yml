caption: 'Escin activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cultured hDPCs. Cells were treated
  with various concentrations of escin for 24 h. (a) The protein expression levels
  of β-catenin and LEF1 were evaluated via Western blot analysis (n = 5). N.S: not
  significant, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 compared to the non-treated control. (b) The
  mRNA expression levels of β-catenin and LEF1 (n = 5) were monitored via real-time
  PCR. N.S: not significant, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 compared to the non-treated control.
  (c) A representative picture of the translocation of β-catenin from the cytosol
  to the nucleus, visualized via immunocytochemistry (n = 5). Data are expressed as
  mean ± SD.'
