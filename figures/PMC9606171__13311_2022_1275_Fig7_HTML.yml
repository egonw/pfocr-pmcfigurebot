caption: 'Bulk RNA-seq data of DTMB-treated 5xFAD mouse brain. a Overview of differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs). b Heat map of DEGs from hippocampus and cortex. c, d Gene
  ontology (GO) analysis. The top enriched GO terms of either upregulated or downregulated
  genes were analyzed from hippocampus and cortex of DTMB- or vehicle-treated 5xFAD
  mice. e, f GSEA enrichment plot (Wiki pathway). Inflammatory response-related gene
  sets were more enriched in the hippocampus and cortex of mice from the 5xFAD group
  treated with vehicle than that found in mice from the DTMB-treated 5xFAD group.
  Hippocampus analysis: NES score =  − 2.44, p < 0.001, and FDR < 0.001. Cortex brain
  analysis: NES score =  − 2.57, p < 0.001, and FDR < 0.001. g Heat map of gene expression
  related to microglial activation in adult microglia. Adult microglia were sorted
  from vehicle- or DTMB-treated 5xFAD mice using MACs system. Quantitative PCR was
  performed to analyze the gene expression related to chronic inflammation and microglial
  activation. Data represent the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) of three
  independent experiments. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001, by one-way ANOVA'
