caption: 'METTL3 is upregulated in FK in mice. (A–C) METTL3 expression in fungus-infected
  corneal tissues was significantly increased on day 5. (D–F). METTL3 expression was
  increased in corneal stromal cells after fungal treatment and peaked at 12 hours
  postinfection. (G) Immunofluorescence analysis of METTL3 in corneal tissue 5 days
  after fungal infection. Scale bar: 130 µm. (H) Immunofluorescence analysis of corneal
  stromal cells 12 hours after fungal treatment. Scale bar: 70 µm. *P < 0.05, **P
  < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001; n = 6.'
