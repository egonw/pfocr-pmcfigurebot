caption: 'Inhibition of APT1 expression affects cell membrane localization of H-Ras.
  (A), Different APT1 siRNAs, labeled 1, 2, and 3, respectively, after transfecting
  with HUVEC; the expression of APT1 RNA was detected using real-time PCR. We found
  that siRNA 1 had the greatest effect on the expression of APT1 RNA. Subsequently,
  siRNA 1 was used in the experiment; (B), HUVEC was transfected with siRNA 1, and
  Western blotting detected APT1 protein expression; (C), To detect the expression
  level in the cell membrane and cytoplasm of H-Ras after the inhibition of APT1;
  (D), shows the expression of H-Ras by fluorescence confocal experiments after inhibition
  of expression of APT1. Na-K ATPase: the internal reference protein of the cell membrane;
  M: the membrane; P: the cytoplasm. The results are shown by mean Â± standard deviation;
  the above experiment was repeated three times; * represents p < 0.05.'
