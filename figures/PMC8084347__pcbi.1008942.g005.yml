figure_title: Pharmacological PDEA reveals consistent metabolic pathway vulnerabilities
  in Adherent RPMI cell lines
caption: A) Pharmacological PDEA () was performed on 1,390 anti-cancer drugs from
  the PRISM database. Drugs were mapped to metabolic pathways by their annotated target(s)
  and then the enrichment of these metabolic pathway inhibitors was analyzed in the
  rank list of drug sensitivity-metabolic pathway activity correlation coefficients.
  Hierarchical clustering was performed on NES values, and results with FDR < 0.25
  are plotted. Dots are colored according to the NES and sized according to the -log10
  FDR. Dots with black outline correspond to results shown in panels B-C and F. B-C)
  Increased Alanine, Aspartate, and Glutamate metabolism (hsa00250) correlates with
  increased response to inhibitors of terpenoid backbone biosynthesis. In contrast,
  decreased Pentose Phosphate Pathway metabolism correlates with increased response
  to inhibitors of Folate Biosynthesis (hsa00790). D-E) Inhibitors of Folate Biosynthesis
  (hsa00790) are more effective when overall metabolic pathway expression is low,
  whereas inhibitors of Ascorbate and Aldarate Metabolism (hsa00053) are more effective
  when overall metabolic pathway expression is high. F) Representative mountain plots
  and the drug(s) driving enrichment of metabolic pathway activities that strongly
  correlate with response to inhibitors of Ascorbate and Aldarate metabolism are shown.
