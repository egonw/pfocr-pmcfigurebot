caption: PI3K/AKT signaling inhibitor LY294002 reverses KAT5 overexpression-mediated
  inflammatory response in EAC mice. (Aâ€“F) The EAC mouse model was established followed
  by the indicated treatment. (A and B) The eosinophilic infiltration was analyzed
  by H&E staining. (C and D) The expression of Eotaxin and RANTES was measured by
  qPCR. (E) The levels of IL-4, IL-13, IL-5, and IL-10 were detected by ELISA. (F)
  CD11c+ dendritic cells and CD4+ T cells infiltration in the conjunctiva were analyzed
  by fluorescence staining. **P < 0.01.
