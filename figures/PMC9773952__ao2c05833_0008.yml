caption: Metabolic pathway diagrams of C. wilfordii adventitious roots (ARs) derived
  from explants cultivated in an open field (ECF) and those cultivated on a heap of
  C. wilfordii roots (ECH). The expression data consist of log2-transformed fold change
  (FC) values (log2FC). A log2FC value range is âˆ’1.5 < log2FC < 1.5. If log2FC value
  is higher than zero (indicated in red), metabolite content would be higher in ARs
  from ECH than in those from ECF. If log2FC value is less than zero (indicated in
  green), metabolite content would be lower in ARs from ECH. If log2FC value is zero
  (indicated in white), metabolite content would be identical in both types of AR.
  Significant differences between ARs induced from ECF and ECH were identified by
  the t test (*p < 0.05).
