caption: 'The correlation between chemical properties and the antioxidant capacity
  of GLP-HV. Note: (a) The correlation between chemical properties and the scavenging
  ability of free radicals from GLP-HV, (b) the correlation between chemical properties
  and the antioxidant capacity in HepG2 cells of GLP-HV, (c) the correlation between
  antioxidant indexes and the Nrf-2/Keap-1 signaling pathway in HepG2 cells of GLP-HV.'
