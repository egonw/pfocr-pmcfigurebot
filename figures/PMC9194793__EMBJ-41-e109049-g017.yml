figure_title: Depletion of Atossa or Porthos mRNA causes impairment in mitochondrial
  metabolic activity, reduced ATP production, and a deficiency in macrophage tissue
  invasion
caption: 'ASchematic indicating the specific inhibitors (in red at right) used to
  block the function of mitochondrial OxPhos components. The glycolysis, TCA cycle,
  and mitochondrial respiratory chain in eukaryotic cells are shown.BGraph shows relative
  porthos (pths) and atos mRNA levels in pths KD S2R+ cells measured by qPCR from
  at least three independent experiments. The data are normalized to results for the
  internal control gene RpS20. pths KD S2R+ cells contain 56% of normal pths mRNA
  levels and display a statistically insignificant decrease in atos mRNA levels. Control
  (n = 6 biological replicates) versus pths (n = 6), P = 0.0002, versus atos (n = 3),
  P = 0.09.CThe contribution of basal OxPhos ATP production rate and glycolytic ATP
  production rate were calculated. The plot shows that both wild‐type and pths KD
  S2R+ cells utilize OxPhos respiration as the predominant bioenergetic pathway to
  produce ATP in these cells; we observe no increase in the relative utilization of
  glycolysis.DThe relative basal values of the Oxygen Consumption rate (OCR), as a
  marker of OxPhos, and Extracellular Acidification Rate (ECAR), as an indication
  of glycolysis, in control and pths KD S2R+ cells are plotted. Basal respiration
  rate is calculated before the addition of antimycin A. For OCR and ECAR assay, analysis
  is from values obtained in n ≥ 3 independent biological experiments each with n > 6
  technical replicate. Control versus pths KD for both assays: P < 0.0001.EGraph shows
  mRNA levels relative to the control of the targeted gene in embryos ubiquitously
  expressing RNAis against subunits of mitochondrial Complexes III and V. Expression
  measured by qPCR and normalized to results for the internal control gene RpS20;
  n = 3 independent biological experiments. RNAi KD of Complex III resulted in 49%
  (RNAi 1), 24% (RNAi 2), and 32% (RNAi 3) of its normal mRNA levels; for Complex
  V, this was 50%. Control versus Complex III RNAi 1, P = 0.0048; versus Complex III
  RNAi 2 P = 0.0002; versus Complex III RNAi 3 P = 0.0005; versus Complex V RNAi P = 0.005FQuantification
  in fixed early Stage 12 embryos shows a significant increase of macrophages on the
  yolk upon the expression in macrophages of any of three different RNAis against
  mitochondrial OxPhos Complex III (UQCR) or an RNAi against Complex V (F1F0, CG3612).
  For control (n = 34 embryos) versus Complex III (Cyt‐c1, CG4769) RNAi 1 (VDRC 109809,
  n = 19) P = 0.0049; versus Complex III (UQCR‐cp1, CG3731) RNAi 2 (VDRC 101350, n = 18)
  P = 0.024; versus Complex III (UQCR‐cp2, CG4169) RNAi 3 (VDRC 100818, n = 16) P = 0.009;
  versus Complex V (F1F0, CG3612) RNAi (VDRC 34664, n = 21) P = 0.0068.G, HQuantification
  of the number of macrophages in vnc segments does not show a significant change
  in general migration along the vnc in embryos whose macrophages express (G) CV‐DN
  or (H) RNAis against mitochondrial OxPhos complex components compared to the control.
  For (G) control (n = 20 embryos) versus CV‐DN (n = 23) P > 0.05. For (H) control
  (n = 14 embryos) versus Complex III (Cyt‐c1, CG4769) RNAi 1 (VDRC 109809, n = 10)
  P > 0.8; versus Complex III (UQCR‐cp1, CG3731) RNAi 2 (VDRC 101350, n = 14) P > 0.05;
  versus Complex III (UQCR‐cp2, CG4169) RNAi 3 (VDRC 100818, n = 11) P > 0.9; versus
  Complex V (F1F0, CG3612) RNAi (VDRC 34664, n = 18) P > 0.2. Data information: Ubiquitous
  expression of RNAis is through da‐GAL4. Mean ± SEM, ns=P > 0.05, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. Unpaired t‐test followed by Sidak''s correction (B,E).
