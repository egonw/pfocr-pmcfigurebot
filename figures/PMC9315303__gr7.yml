caption: Working model for genistein promotes M1 macrophage apoptosis and reduces
  inflammatory response in LPS-induced cardiovascular injury. Genistein regulates
  NF-κB/miR-21/TIPE2 signaling pathway, which on the one hand leads to inhibition
  of downstream AKT phosphorylation and promotes apoptosis of M1 macrophages, and
  on the other hand down-regulates TRIF and MyD88 expressions to reduce inflammation.
  As a result, it can resist LPS-induced cardiovascular injury.
