caption: Working model illustrating the effects of TC on liver phenotypes in WT and
  α-CGRP−/− mice. (A) TC effects on liver phenotypes are due to changes in hepatic
  BA composition leading to enhanced expression of the cAMP/PKA/ERK signaling pathway.
  As a consequence, cholangiocytes acquire a neuroendocrine phenotype and promote
  the release of α-CGRP neuropeptide. By an autocrine mechanism, α-CGRP binds CGRP-receptor
  components (CALRL, RAMP-1, and RCP) that are expressed on cholangiocytes and promotes
  cholangiocyte proliferation, liver fibrosis, and angiogenesis. (B) In the absence
  of α-CGRP neuropeptide, cholangiocytes overexpress CGRP-receptor components (CALRL,
  RAMP-1, and RCP) as a compensatory mechanism and reduce biliary proliferation, biliary
  senescence, and liver fibrosis and angiogenesis. Graphic illustration was created
  by BioRender.com.
