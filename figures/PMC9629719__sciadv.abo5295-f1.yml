figure_title: Schematic illustration of the LAT:Grb2:SOS_PR condensation phase transition
  system
caption: (A) The TCR signaling pathway, which involves assembly formation with LAT:Grb2:SOS.
  (B) In vitro reconstitution of the LAT:Grb2:SOS condensation phase transition on
  a supported lipid bilayer, where the assembly eventually relaxes to a disordered
  gel state. (C) TIRF images of the LAT-555 molecules during the progress of a phase
  transition with 5.8 μM Grb2 and 1.45 μM SOS_PR. (D) Corresponding LAT density (x)
  distribution over time. The density of LAT molecules was calculated on the basis
  of TIRF intensity and FCS readout calibration.

  condensation phase transition on membranes.
