caption: MA attenuates the inflammatory effects induced by LPS through the NLRP3/IL-1β
  signaling pathway by activating the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway. Cells were pretreated
  with10 μM SFN for 1 h and/or 100 mg/L MA for 12 h and/or 10 μM NAC (Positive control)
  for 30 min and then stimulated with LPS (1 mg/L) for 24 h. (a) qRT-PCR was performed
  to evaluate the mRNA expression of NLRP3 and IL-1β in RAW264.7 cells. (b) Western
  blot was performed to detect the protein levels of NLRP3 and IL-1β in RAW264.7 cells.
  (c) ELISA was conducted to detect the levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β in
  RAW264.7 cells. (d) Western blot was performed to detect the protein levels of N-Nrf2
  (Nuclear-Nrf2) in RAW264.7 cells. (e) qRT-PCR was performed to evaluate the mRNA
  expression of Nrf2, NQO1 and HO-1 in RAW264.7 cells. (f) Western blot was performed
  to detect the protein levels of Nrf2, NQO1, and HO-1 in RAW264.7 cells. (g) MDA
  concentration was analyzed with 2-thiobarbituric and the activities of antioxidant
  enzymes including SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT were determined using ELISA kits. (h) The
  level of intracellular ROS was measured by DCF fluorescence using an enzyme marker.
  Data are shown as mean ± SEM obtained from three independent experiments. * p <
  0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
