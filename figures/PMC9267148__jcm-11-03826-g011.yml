caption: Involvement of CIAPIN1 and related proteins in networks of protein–chemotherapeutic
  drug interaction. (a) The interactive 3D viewer illustrates the highest Vina score
  of binding mode and represents positions of protein–ligand docking at their pocket
  binding sites. Blue cartoon ribbons represent the CIAPIN1 protein interface to the
  doxorubicin ligand (ball and stick). The interaction bond is presented by the dashed
  line. (b) Protein–chemical interaction of CIAPIN1 (bold blue circle), related proteins
  (blue circles), and chemotherapeutic drugs cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, gemcitabine,
  and doxorubicin (red circles). Thicker lines represent strong associations. Thin
  lines represent weak associations.
