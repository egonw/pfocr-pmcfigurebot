caption: 'Dehydrocorydaline (DHC) attenuated complete anterior cruciate ligament transection
  (ACLT)-induced OA progression. (A) Cartilage was stained by H&E and safranin-O/fast
  green (10×). Ac: articular cavity; cs: cartilage surface; sb: subchondral bone.
  Red arrow: thickness of the cartilage; black arrow: inflammatory cell infiltration.

  Data are presented as mean ± SD. *, p < 0.05 compared to the healthy group. #, p
  < 0.05 compared to the OA group.'
