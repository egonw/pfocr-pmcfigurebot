caption: 'TE-enhanced heatmap depicting IPA biological functions for TE-enhanced genes;
  entries were limited to those present in at least two datasets in the full analysis.
  Figure consists of two wrapped columns for the full and homology methods. Along
  the top x-axis, each column is further divided by dataset: 3&4* DEGs shared by at
  least three species and the whole species DEG lists for human, mouse, cow, and pig.
  Along the y-axis are the identified biological functions. Level of significant overlap
  was set at P < 0.05; entries with white color denote those not meeting significance.
  Data generated from Supplemental Table S18. DEG, differentially expressed gene;
  IPA, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis; TE, trophectoderm.'

  transition: metabolic and physiological changes take center stage.'
