figure_title: Shared and specific differences between cell types and in response to
  stress
caption: (A) The display summarizes the numbers of differentially expressed proteins
  between cell types, response to stress, and stress-independent changes (ANOVA, adjusted
  p value < 0.05) and the relationships between them. Squared brackets denote the
  overlap with respective significant differences at the RNA level as the Jaccard
  index and the percentage of proteins also in the significant RNA set. Curly brackets
  denote the fraction of set specific proteins out of the total number of proteins
  in that set. Parentheses denote the Jaccard index for this set intersection. See
  also  and .  and  show additional numbers and UpSet plots illustrating the set relationships.  shows
  the proteins with significant interaction terms.(B) The display summarizes Gene
  Ontology pathways significantly enriched (adjusted p value < 0.05, hypergeometric
  test) among sets of proteins that were significantly enriched in one of the two
  cell types (adjusted p value < 0.05, ANOVA), sorted by their stress response (significantly
  induced to significantly repressed, adjusted p value < 0.05, ANOVA). Lines between
  nodes denote shared members (Jaccard index > 0.375). Node sizes represent the number
  of proteins in a pathway. Node darkness represents the enrichment of the pathway
  over the background. Nodes are labeled if they have >200 members or an enrichment
  >3.5-fold. AC, adenylate cyclase; act., activated; Adj., adjusted; CPA, cyclopiazonic
  acid; HC, hippocampus; iSpMNs, induced spinal motor neurons; iCrMNs, induced cranial
  motor neurons; ixn., interaction; loc., localization; membr., membrane; myop., myopathy;
  pos., positive; prot., protein; reg., regulation; syn., synapse/synaptic.
