caption: Functional enrichment analysis of KLF5. (A) KLF5 expression as determined
  by NGS in the normal mucosa (Nor), OLP, and OSCC tissues of 2 clinical samples.
  (B) Differential expression of KLF5 in normal tissue and OSCC in TCGA dataset. (C)
  The KEGG pathway analysis between KLF5 high-expression and low-expression groups.
  (D) Hallmark analysis between KLF5 high-expression and low-expression groups. *,
