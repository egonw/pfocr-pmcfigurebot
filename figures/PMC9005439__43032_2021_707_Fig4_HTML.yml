caption: 'Expression of p38 and JNK in the testes of rats with spermatogenic dysfunction
  treated by ECH. A, C Western blotting showed that the activation of p38 and JNK
  in testis after spermatogenic dysfunction was statistically significant; treatment
  with ECH reduced these effects. B, D histogram showing the mean value ± standard
  error of the level of p38 and JNK proteins in testis of all groups; **compared with
  the control group, P < 0.01; #compared with the model group, P < 0.05; ##compared
  with the model group, P < 0.01'
