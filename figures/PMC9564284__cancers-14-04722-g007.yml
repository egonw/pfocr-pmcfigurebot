caption: LETM2 accelerates PDAC malignant progression by activating the PI3K-Akt pathway
  in vitro. (A) Cell apoptosis was measured using flow cytometry. (B) Cell migratory
  and invasive ability were measured using transwell assay. Representative photographs
  (left) and quantification (right) were shown. Scale bars, 50 μm. (C) Cell growth
  was measured using CCK-8 assays. The data are represented as mean ± SEM (n = 3 biologically
  independent experiments), and Student’s t-test was performed. Ns, not significant;
  * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001.
