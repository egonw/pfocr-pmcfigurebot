caption: ACY1 expression in human cancers and its relationship with clinical severity
  stratification and prognosis in CRC patients. (A) ACY1 expression levels in diverse
  tumors and adjacent noncancerous tissues from TCGA database. Comparison of ACY1
  expression in tumors and corresponding normal tissues in different types of cancer.
  (Red indicates tumor samples; blue indicates noncancerous samples). ACC, adrenocortical
  carcinoma; BLCA, bladder urothelial carcinoma; BRCA, breast invasive carcinoma;
  CESC, cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma; CHOL, cholangiocarcinoma;
  COAD, colon adenocarcinoma; DLBC, lymphoid neoplasm diffuse large B-cell lymphoma;
  ESCA, esophageal carcinoma; GBM, glioblastoma multiforme; HNSC, head and neck squamous
  cell carcinoma; KICH, kidney chromophobe; KIRC, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma;
  KIRP, kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma; LAML, acute myeloid leukemia; LGG,
  brain lower grade glioma; LIHC, liver hepatocellular carcinoma; LUAD, lung adenocarcinoma;
  LUSC, lung squamous cell carcinoma; MESO, mesothelioma; OV, ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma;
  PAAD, pancreatic adenocarcinoma; PCPG, pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma; PRAD,
  prostate adenocarcinoma; READ, rectum adenocarcinoma; SARC, sarcoma; SKCM, skin
  cutaneous melanoma; STAD, stomach adenocarcinoma; TGCT, testicular germ cell tumors;
  THCA, thyroid carcinoma; THYM, thymoma; UCEC, uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma;
  UCS, uterine carcinosarcoma; UVM, uveal melanoma. (B) human ACY1 expression in normal
  rectal mucosa and colorectal cancer (including low-grade dysplasia and high-grade
  dysplasia) from GSE3629 datasets. (C) human ACY1 expression in normal colon mucosa
  and colorectal cancer (including low-grade dysplasia and high-grade dysplasia) from
  GSE37182 datasets. (D) ACY1 expression levels in READ patients with lymphatic invasion
  or not and with perineural invasion or not from TCGA datasets. (E) ACY1 expression
  levels in CRC patients with or without lymph node metastases from the GSE4459 dataset.
  (F) ACY1 expression levels in COAD patients with different AJCC stages in the GSE38832
  dataset. (G) Kaplan–Meier analysis of DSS in GSE38832 COAD patients based on ACY1
  expression. DSS, disease-specific survival; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001
  and **** p < 0.0001. ns. means no significance.
