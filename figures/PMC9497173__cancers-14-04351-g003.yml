caption: 'Overview of the general autophagy pathway in mammalian cells. (Bottom) Autophagy
  can be divided into five major steps: (1) Initiation and nucleation of the double-membrane
  phagophore, (2) elongation, (3) closure of the phagophore to form the autophagosome,
  (4) autophagosome-lysosome fusion; and (5) lysosomal degradation and nutrient recycling.
  (Top left) Upon activation by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the unc-51-like
  autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1) complex (also known as the preinitiation complex)
  initiates autophagy by activating the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)
  complex (also known as the initiation complex) via phosphorylation of Beclin1 and
  VPS34. Thereafter, the activated class III PI3K complex generates phosphatidylinositol
  3-phosphate (PI3P) at the site of nucleation of the phagophore from ER, leading
  to the binding of PI3P-binding proteins, such as WIPI proteins, that are required
  for phagophore maturation. (Top middle) ProLC3 is cleaved by ATG4B and to produce
  LC3-I. Thereafter, LC3-I is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) with a series
  of ubiquitin-like conjugation reactions that include the E1 ligase (ATG7), E2 ligase
  (ATG3), and the E3 ligase complex that is composed of ATG12, ATG5, and ATG16L. PE-conjugated
  LC3, termed LC3-II, is inserted into the phagophore membranes, where LC3-II promotes
  phagophore elongation and closure. LC3B-II also works as a docking site of autophagy
  receptor proteins, facilitating the trafficking of their cargos to the autophagosome,
  a process known as selective autophagy. Multiple inhibitors have been developed
  so far, which are shown in gray frames. ULK, Unc-51-like kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase; PI3P, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; WIPI,
  WD-repeat protein interacting with phosphoinositide; mTORC1, mammalian target of
  rapamycin complex 1; AMPK, 5â€² AMP-activated protein kinase; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine.  is
