figure_title: Identification of pathway and drugs related with LTBP1. A, Top ten activated
  pathways based on highly correlated genes of cervical cancer tissue from the GSE9750
  dataset. B, Expression of SMAD binding genes with or without expression of LTBP1
  shRNA in HELA cells at the mRNA level. C, Protein level of ZEB2, TGFB1, SMAD7, p-SMAD3,
  and LTBP1 in HELA cell with or without expression of LTBP1 shRNA. D, mRNA level
  of LTBP1 after treatment with 13 drugs. E, mRNA level of LTBP1 in HELA and HT-3
  cells with or without treatment with 10 μM of carboplatin. Data are reported as
  means and SD. F, Protein level of TGFB1 and LTBP1 in HELA and HT-3 cells treated
  with different concentrations of carboplatin. G, LTBP1 gene expression in clinical
  resistance (n=12 patients) and response (n=12 patients) to a single treatment with
  carboplatin from in-house data. ***P<0.001 (t-test)
