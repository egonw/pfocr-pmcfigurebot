caption: 'Curcumin pretreatments inhibited inflammatory responses induced by oxygen-glucose
  deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) in rat astrocyte. (a) The mRNA level of interleukin-6
  (IL-6). (b) The mRNA level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). (c) The mRNA
  level of IL-1β. Versus control group, ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, respectively;
  versus OGD/R group, #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, and ###P < 0.001 (n = 3).'
