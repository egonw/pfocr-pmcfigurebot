caption: 'Gene networks for the long-term depression pathway. Nodes = genes; edges
  = STRING database connections; node color = differential expression between groups
  characterized by opioid (M = morphine or S = saline) followed by MIA exposure (C
  = control or P = viral MIA) from red (under-expressed in the first vs. second group,
  to yellow, and green (over-expressed in the first versus second group. Networks:
  MC vs. -SC = morphine-treated Control vs. saline-treated Control; MP-MC = morphine-treated
  MIA vs. morphine-treated Control; MC vs. SP = morphine-treated Control vs. saline-treated
  MIA; MP vs. SC = morphine-treated MIA vs. saline-treated Control; SP vs. SC = saline-treated
  MIA vs. saline-treated Control; and MP vs. SP = morphine-treated MIA vs. saline-treated
  MIA.'
