caption: AMPK signaling pathway in autophagy and cancer. AMPK may form a heterotrimeric
  complex that contains a catalytic α-subunit and regulatory β- and γ-subunits. Following
  AMP binding to the γ-subunit, the allosteric activation complex is phosphorylated
  at threonine 172 and is phosphorylated by upstream LKB1 at the activation loop of
  the alpha subunit, which induces autophagy. AMPK can also act on the downstream
  factors, TSC2, p53 and p27kip1, and mediate cancer formation and development.
