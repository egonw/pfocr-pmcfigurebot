caption: PREPL is a network key driver downregulated in human sporadic LOAD postmortem
  samples. (A) Subnetwork around PREPL. Genes differentially expressed in dementia
  brains are colored in blue (downregulated) or red (upregulated). PREPL is downregulated
  in AD brains. (Continued)(B) Violin and dot plot showing the distribution of PREPL
  expression stratified by CDR. The red dot in the middle is the median value, and
  the red line in the center represents the interquartile range of the density estimate.
  There is a significant negative correlation between PREPL expression and CDR (Spearman’s
  r = −0.47, P = 6.0E-13). (C) Brain cell type–specific expression of PREPL based
  on single-cell RNA-seq data from (). (D) Top gene ontology (GO) and pathways showing
  increased (left) or decreased (right) correlation with PREPL in dementia brains.
  Y-axis denotes the mean difference of correlation coefficients between dementia
  and nondementia brains. Color intensity denotes adjusted Wilcoxon paired rank sum
  test P value.
