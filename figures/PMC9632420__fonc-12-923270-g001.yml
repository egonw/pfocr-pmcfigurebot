caption: USP8 regulates PCa cell growth and proliferation. (A) DU145 and PC3 cell
  lines were transiently transfected with scramble siRNA, siUSP8, a mock vector, and
  a USP8-overexpressing vector. The MTT assay was used to determine cell survival
  at a different time point (0, 24, 48, 72 h). (B) Growth curves of DU145 and PC3
  PCa cell lines. DU145 and PC3 PCa cells were transfected with scramble siRNA, siUSP8,
  a mock vector, and a USP8-overexpressing vector. Cells were cultured with a density
  of 1 × 105 cells/ml. At the same time points, a total number of Trypan Blue-negative
  cells were manually counted and displayed. (C) DU145 and PC3 cells were transfected
  with scrambled siRNA or SiUSP8, and mock or USP8-overexpressing vector followed
  by docetaxel therapy with 4.5 and 3 nM, respectively. After 48 h, the cells were
  subjected to MTT assay and the cell survival from optical density (OD) calculated.
  The OD was set to 490 nm, and all data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3, *p < 0.05
  and **p < 0.01).
