caption: LNC EBLN3P targets the Keap1-Nrf2 system. (A) GO pathway enrichment analysis.
  The dashed box highlights the antioxidant activity inhibited by LNC EBLN3P knockdown.
  (B,C) qPCR analyses of the transcription expression of Nrf2 and Keap1 in H1299 cells
  transfected with shNC or shEBLN3P. Relative densitometry values for the representative
  blots are given below each band. (D–F) Western blot analyses of Nrf2 and Keap1.
  Data are represented as means ± SD (three biological replicates; *** p < 0.001).
