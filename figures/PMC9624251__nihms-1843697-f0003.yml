figure_title: BiNGO analysis reveals biological processes significantly regulated
  in astrocytes after PTZ treatment
caption: (A) Exploratory GO pathway analysis of all regulated genes identifies trends
  for transcripts in key metabolic processes (e.g., mitochondrial, cytoskeletal, and
  ribosomal transcripts) with changes in ribosome occupancy. The color scale indicates
  significance for hypergeometric test. Category size is scaled to the number of genes.
  Arrows represent parent-child relationships in GO terms.(B) Heatmaps of the expression
  of the genes that make up three example categories show that most genes in the mitochondrial
  and ribosomal categories are downregulated with seizure. For cytoskeletal elements,
  there is a change between the genes in the category.
