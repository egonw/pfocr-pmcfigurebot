caption: NO alters the expressions of adipogenic proteins during adipocyte differentiation
  via a Zn2+-dependent pathway. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated in the presence or
  absence of TPEN (10 μM) with or without NONOate (20 μM) or ZnCl2 (20 μM), and adipocyte
  differentiation was induced. The expression of the adipogenic proteins C/EBPα (A),
  PPARγ (B), and aP2 (C) was measured by immunoblotting with β-actin as the loading
  control. Those immunoblots are displayed as examples. Results are shown as mean
  ± SD for three independent experiments. * p < 0.05 compared to the untreated group.
