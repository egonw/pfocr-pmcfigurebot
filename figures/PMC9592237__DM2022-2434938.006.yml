caption: 'MiR-452-5p facilitated BC cells survival by downregulating RGS2. MDA-MB-231
  and HCC1937 were transfected with an empty vector, mimic-NC, RGS2-OE (OE), mimic,
  or OE+mimic. (a) Cell viability in BC cells transfected as described above was uncovered
  utilizing CCK-8 assay. (b) Bax and Bcl-2 protein levels were uncovered utilizing
  western blotting analysis in BC cells transfected as described above. (c) Migrated
  cells were counted utilizing transwell in BC cells transfected as described above.
  ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.001 vs empty vector; ∗P < 0.05, ^^P < 0.001 vs mimic-NC; #P <
  0.05, ##P < 0.001 vs OE+mimic.'
