caption: Progesterone activated the caspase signaling pathway. These cell lines were
  treated with progesterone 100 Î¼M for 24 h, and a Western blot was performed. After
  adding progesterone, protein levels of cleaved caspase 3 were increased in FE25,
  FE25-lenti-ctrl, and FE25-PRB, but not FE25-PRA PRA, progesterone receptor A; PRB,
  progesterone receptor B. Representative of n= 3. The number under each lane represented
  the relative quantitation of the expression in FE25.
