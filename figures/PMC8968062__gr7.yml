caption: cGAS-STING pathway regulates cancer stemness via improving STAT3 activity.
  (A) Venn diagram depicts the number of genes whose expression changes significantly
  in cGAS- or STING-knockout cells compared to the NC (P < 0.05). (B) GSEA analysis
  of JAK/STAT3 signaling in NC vs cGAS-/- or STING-/- group. (C) Western blot analysis
  of STAT3 expression and STAT3 phosphorylation in NC, cGAS-/- and STING-/- cells
  from different cancer cells. (D) Western blot analysis of STAT3 expression and STAT3
  phosphorylation in control, cGAS-/- with empty vector, STING-/- with empty vector,
  cGAS- and STING-rescued HeLa cells. (E, F) GO analysis of significantly changed
  genes in NC vs cGAS-/- group or NC vs STING-/- group. (G) Schematic diagram of cGAS-STING
  pathway sustaining cancer stemness by activation of STAT3 activity. Data were represented
  as mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 from unpaired Student's t-test.
