caption: Identification of GCH1-associated DEGs and the potential transcription factor
  STAT1 of GCH1. Heat map showing the top 50 DEGs between high- and low-GCH1 expression
  groups in (a) BRCA and (b) OV. GSEA showing the enrichment of the JAK-STAT pathway
  in GCH1-high expression (c) breast and (d) ovarian cancer. Shown are correlation
  of GCH1 and STAT1 expressions in (e) BRCA and (f) OV cohorts, respectively. (g)
  Cistrome Data Browser indicated STAT1 regulated GCH1 transcription directly. (h)
  GCH1 mRNA were evaluated by qRT-PCR in MDA-MB-231, A2780, and HCC38 cells when treated
  with 10 μM niraparib and/or 50 μM JAK inhibitor for 48 h. (i–k) The protein level
  of GCH1 were determined by Western blot in MDA-MB-231, A2780, and HCC38 cells after
  treated with 10 μM niraparib and/or 50 μM JAK inhibitor for 72 h.
