caption: The impacts of HS3ST1 knockdown or overexpression on the apoptosis in H1650
  and A549 cells. (a) The apoptosis rates of A549 cells after they were treated with
  HS3ST1 overexpression or knockdown. (b) The apoptosis rates of H1650 cells after
  they were treated with HS3ST1 overexpression or knockdown. (c) Flow cytometry data
  on A549 cells are shown in representative images. (d) Flow cytometry findings in
  H1650 cells are shown in representative images. ∗∗P < 0.01 compared to control,
  N = 12.
