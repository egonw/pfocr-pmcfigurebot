caption: 'Plasma EV confirmation and exLR-seq analysis. (a) Transmission electron
  microscopy image of isolated vesicles, scale 200 nm. (b) Particle size analysis
  of isolated vesicles. (c) Western blots of calnexin, which should be detected in
  PBMC, but not in isolated vesicles, used as controls. EV markers TSG101 and CD63
  detected in isolated vesicles, but not in PBMC. (d) Distribution of mapped reads
  to the annotated genes and identified circRNAs. (e) Volcano plot of differential
  expressed exLRs between SCLC and healthy controls. (f) The KEGG pathway enriched
  in the SCLC group by GSEA. EV: extracellular vesicle; PBMC: peripheral blood mononuclear
  cell; exLR: EV long RNA; SCLC: small-cell lung cancer; GSEA: gene set-enrichment
  analysis.'
