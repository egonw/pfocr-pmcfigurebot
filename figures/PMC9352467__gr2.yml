caption: SOMCL-19-133 inhibits the NEDD8 pathway, which leads to DNA damage response,
  cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. (a) Representative western blot showing the levels
  of UBA3NEDD8, Ubc12NEDD8, CulNEDD8 conjugates, and CRLs substrates in SOMCL-19-133
  or MLN4924 treated cells. (b) SOMCL-19-133 induced a dose-dependent increase in
  DNA damage. HCT-116 and RKO cells were treated with various concentrations of SOMCL-19-133
  or MLN4924 for 24 h. Induction of γH2AX, p-Chk1 (Ser317), and p-Chk2 (T68) was determined
  by western blot. (c and d) Effects of SOMCL-19-133 on cell cycle distribution and
  apoptosis. Cells were treated with SOMCL-19-133, MLN4924, or Control for (c) 24
  h or (d) 48 h, and (c) DNA profiles were analyzed by PI staining-based flow cytometry;
  > 4N represents cells with greater than tetraploid DNA content. >4N cells were not
  included in the cell cycle distribution analysis. (d) Apoptotic cells were detected
  by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining-based flow cytometry. MLN represents MLN4924. Data
  are presented as mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. (e) The levels
  of cleaved (Clvd) caspase-3, cleaved caspase-7, cleaved caspase-8, and cleaved PARP
  were assessed by western blot in cells treated with various doses (0, 0.1, 0.3,
  1 µM) of SOMCL-19-133, MLN4924 for 48 h. (f) Western blot analysis of Noxa, Puma,
  BAD, BID, BAX, BAK, BCL-XL, BCL-2, and MCL-1 in cells treated with SOMCL-19-133
  or MLN4924 at 0, 0.1, 0.3, 1 µM for 48 h. All of the experiments were repeated three
  times.
