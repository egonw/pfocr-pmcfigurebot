caption: MS-associated genes. (A) MS gene databases. (B) Top MS-associated genes (six
  or more database sources). (C) Number of sources for MS-associated genes. (D) MS-associated
  genes (four or more sources) and their response to MMF, DRF, and IDMF. The 40 genes
  most strongly altered by one of the three compounds are shown (i.e., lowest p-value).
  (E,G,I) Average absolute FC (|log2(FC)|) of MS-associated genes (four or more sources).
  The null distribution shown was obtained by calculating the absolute FC in randomly
  sampled gene sets of the same size (10,000 simulation trials). (F,H,J) MS-associated
  genes most strongly altered by each compound (four or more sources). The number
  of database sources linking each to MS is shown in parentheses. Significantly altered
  genes (p < 0.05) are shown in red (increased) or blue (decreased) font. (K,L) GO
  BP terms enriched among MS-associated genes (three or more sources) altered by IDMF
  (p < 0.05 with FC > 1.25 or FC < 0.80). The number of genes associated with each
  GO BP term is indicated in parentheses (left margin) and example genes are listed
  within each figure.
