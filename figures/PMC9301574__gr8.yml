caption: Effect of the treatment with 4-HB analogs on serum metabolites in Coq9R239X
  mice.(A) Variable importance in projection (VIP) scores plots for the metabolites
  modified by the mutation and normalized by β-RA and VA treatments in the brain.
  The right heatmap indicates the metabolite levels for each experimental group.(B–F)
  Key metabolites related to amino acid metabolism (B), carnitines (C), hexosamines
  biosynthetic pathway (D), glycolysis/TCA (E) and pyrimidine metabolism (F) detected
  in the serum of Coq9+/+ mice, Coq9R239X mice, Coq9R239X mice after 1% β-RA treatment
  and Coq9R239X mice after 1% VA treatment at 3 months of age.Data are expressed as
  average peak area ±SD compared to wild-type. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001,
  differences versus Coq9+/+; +P < 0.05, ++P < 0.01, +++P < 0.001, versus Coq9R239X;
  (one-way ANOVA with a Tukey's post hoc test; n = 5 for each group).

  and therapeutic factors in CoQ deficiency.
