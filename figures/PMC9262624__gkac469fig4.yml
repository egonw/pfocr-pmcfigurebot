caption: Genetic interactions between teb-6 and DSB repair pathway mutations. (A)
  Representative images of Col-0 and indicated mutant seedlings grown for 10 d. Scale
  bars = 1 cm. (B) Quantitative analysis of the primary root length of 10-d-old seedlings
  grown as described in (A) (n = 12–27, means ± SD, **P < 0.01, compared with Col-0,
  two-tailed Student's t-test). (C) Representative images of PI staining (red) to
  visualize the cell walls in root tips of Col-0 and indicated mutant seedlings grown
  for 10 days. Completely stained cells are dead. Scale bars = 50 μm. (D) Representative
  image of teb-6 xrcc2 and teb-6 lig4 xrcc2 seedlings grown for 7 days (upper panel,
  scale bars = 1 cm) and its enlargement (lower panel, scale bars = 1 mm). (E–H) Relative
  expression of GR1 (E and G) and PARP1 (F and H) in teb-6, lig4, teb-6 lig4, ku70
  and teb-6 ku70 seedlings (E and F), and xrcc2, teb-6 xrcc2, rad51d and teb-6 rad51d
  seedlings (G and H) in response to SNP as determined by qRT-PCR analysis. At least
  50 plants were used per replicate. Data were normalized to SAND mRNA levels in the
  same samples and expressed as means ± SD (n = 3) relative to untreated Col-0. Different
  letters represent significant differences (P < 0.05, one-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD).
