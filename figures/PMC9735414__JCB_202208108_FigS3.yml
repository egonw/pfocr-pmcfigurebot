caption: 'Binding strength between KIF4 and PARP1 was stronger in mutant KIF4. (A)
  Immunoblotting results of BioID. BirA indicated the mock vector transfected cells.
  Input or pull-down lysates were blotted with the indicated antibodies. Total biotinylated
  proteins were confirmed by streptavidin-conjugated horse radish peroxidase (Strep-HRP).
  Red arrows indicate the overexpressed KIF4 band and the black arrow indicates endogenous
  PARP1. (B) Immunocytochemistry of primary neurons using the indicated antibodies,
  mouse (MIgG), and rabbit IgG (RIgG); Scale bar, 10 Î¼m. Source data are available
  for this figure: .'
