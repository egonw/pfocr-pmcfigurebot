caption: Network analysis of the functional role of deregulated genes in diabetic
  kidney disease. (a) Inter-relational pathway enrichment analysis is shown for the
  upregulated DEGs in DKD samples; (b) for the downregulated DEGs in DKD; (c) for
  the 41 DEGs overlapping DKD and COVID-19 pathways. Circle represents GO terms, triangle
  and octagon represent KEGG and REACTOME, respectively, while green, orange, purple
  and pink color represent pathways.
