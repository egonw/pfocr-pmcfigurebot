caption: Metabolic profiling of rat plasma revealed that Amot PG genetic alteration
  caused changes in several metabolic pathways. (A) Flow chart showing the steps involved
  in the metabolic profiling of the rat plasma on a gas chromatography mass spectromery/mass
  spectrometry (GC‐MS/MS) platform. (B) Metabolic pathway enrichment using MetaboAnalyst.
  Pentose and glucuronate interconversions and the TCA cycle were enriched as the
  most impactful metabolic pathways associated with Amot PG alteration. The node colour
  was based on its p‐value, and the node radius was determined based on their pathway
  impact values. (C) Rat plasma concentrations of xylose, xylulose and arabinose,
  which are the key altered molecules in pentose and glucuronate interconversions,
  and (D) isocitric acid, citric acid and succinic acid, which are the key altered
  molecules in the TCA cycle. The plasma levels of all these metabolites were significantly
  higher in the PG rats compared to the WT rats (median ± interquartile range (IQR),
  n = 10 for each group). (E) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway
  enrichment of the pentose and glucuronate interconversions pathway and TCA cycles
  with the differentially expressed genes identified in RNA‐Seq.
