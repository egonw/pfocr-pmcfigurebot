figure_title: Single-cell transcriptome atlas of the human testis in health and T2DM
caption: a Schematic illustration of the experimental and analysis workflow. b UMAP
  and clustering analysis of single-cell transcriptome data from normal spermatogenesis
  human testis (n = 2810), integrated with single-cell transcriptome data of two Type
  2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)’ testes (DM patient 1 (DM1), n = 441; DM patient 2 (DM2),
  n = 459). Each dot represents a single cell and is colored according to its donor
  of origin. c UMAP plots showing the cell colors by the identified cell clusters
  between normal and diabetic patients. d Histogram showing the number of (left) upregulated
  differential expression genes and (right) downregulated differential genes from
  the normal and diabetic patients single-cell RNA sequencing data. The blue histogram
  represented total differential genes, and the red represented metabolic genes. e
  Enriched GO terms in the upregulated and downregulated metabolism-related genes
  of testicular cells from diabetic versus normal. The statistical test is a hypergeometric
  test. f Metabolic pathway activities in the testicular cell types including spermatogonia
  (SPG), spermatocyte (SPC), spermatid (SPD), and Sertoli (ST) cells from the normal
  and diabetic single-cell RNA sequencing data.
