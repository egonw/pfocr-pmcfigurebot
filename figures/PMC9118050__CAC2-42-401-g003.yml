caption: 'Molecular mechanisms of fibroblast activation. CXCL12 and TGF‐β activate
  fibroblasts by binding to CXCR4 and TGF‐β receptors, respectively, inducing the
  upregulation of α‐SMA and secretion of TGF‐β and CXCL12. Wnt7a also activates fibroblasts
  by binding to the TGF‐β receptor. TGF‐β and PDGF downregulate IDH3α by binding to
  the TGF‐β receptor and PDGFR, respectively. Downregulation of IDH3α increased the
  levels of effective α‐KG and HIF1α, resulting in enhanced glycolysis and attenuated
  OXPHOS. The binding of OPN to CD44 and integrin αvβ3 activate fibroblasts via AKT
  and ERK signaling pathway, respectively, which converge to upregulate α‐SMA, FSP1
  and FAP, and the activated fibroblasts secrete increased CXCL1, CXCL2, COX2, IL‐6,
  OPN and collagen. Exosomal miR‐9 increases the motility of fibroblasts and upregulate
  α‐SMA expression. Exosomal miR‐125b downregulates TP53INP1 and TP53, activating
  fibroblasts characterized by upregulated α‐SMA. Exosomal miR‐222 reduces LBR expression
  and increases α‐SMA and FSP1 expression. Exosomal miR‐146a downregulates TXNIP,
  activating the β‐catenin pathway and upregulating α‐SMA and FAP expression. MiR‐370‐3p
  from exosomes downregulates CYLD and upregulates NFκB, increasing the motility and
  paracrine signaling of IL‐1β, IL‐6 and IL‐8 in fibroblasts. Exosomal survivin increases
  the motility of fibroblasts and upregulates the levels of α‐SMA and vimentin. Abbreviations:
