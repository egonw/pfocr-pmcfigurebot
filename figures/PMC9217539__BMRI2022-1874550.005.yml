caption: 'The influence of Rab22a on PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. The western
  blot analysis results revealed that the expression of p-PI3K, p-AKT (Ser473), p-mTOR
  (Ser2448), and Rab22a induced by Rab22a overexpression or decreased by PI3K inhibitors
  in TPC1 and K1 (a and b). Statistical data were the mean ± SD of the three repeated
  independent trials: ∗∗∗P < 0.001, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗P < 0.05.'
