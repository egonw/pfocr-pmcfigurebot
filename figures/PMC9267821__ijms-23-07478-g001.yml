caption: 'Ltf deficiency impairs regenerative capability of skeletal muscle. (A) Real-time
  RT-PCR of Ltf expression levels in WT mice of TA muscle from days 0 to day 7 after
  BaCl2 injury and detected the TA tissue of Ltf-KO mice injured for 1 day and 3 days.
  (B) Immunoblots illustrate the protein levels of Ltf and an unrelated GAPDH in TA
  muscles from days 0 to day 7 after BaCl2 injury and detected the TA tissue of Ltf-KO
  mice injured for 1 day and 3 days. (C) Immunofluorescence results represent Ltf
  expression in WT and Ltf-KO mice of TA tissue on day 1 of injury. Scale bar: 10
  μm. (D) Absolute body weight of adult WT and Ltf-KO mice, relative uninjured TA
  muscle wet weight of adult WT and Ltf-KO mice. (E) Pathological analysis plots represent
  hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) –stained TA cross-sections (CSA) of WT and Ltf-KO mice
  in the uninjured state. Scale bar: 60 μm. (F) Myofiber size (percentage) distributions
  of WT and Ltf-KO TA muscle were measured by using ImageJ software. (G) Representative
  photomicrographs of H&E-stained sections showing a delayed regeneration of injured
  TA muscle in Ltf-KO mice compared with that in WT at day 5 after BaCl2 injection.
  Scale bar: 60 μm. (H) Statistical analysis of mean area of TA muscle CSA in adult
  Ltf-KO and WT mice 5 days after injury. (I) Regenerated myofiber size (percentage)
  distributions of WT and Ltf-KO TA muscle 5 days after BaCl2 injury were measured
  by using ImageJ software. Only myofibers with centrally located nuclei were counted.
  (J) Quantification of the ratio of regenerating myofibers containing two or more
  centralized nuclei per field at day 5 post-injury. (K) Representative overlaid photomicrographs
  of TA muscle sections of WT and Ltf-KO mice 5 days post-injury after immunostaining
  for eMyHC (red) and laminin (green). Nuclei were labeled by DAPI. Scale bar: 30
  μm. (L) Average CSA of eMyHC-positive fibers in TA muscle 5 days post-injury. (M)
  Representative photomicrographs of Masson-stained sections show increased collagen
  fibers in damaged TA muscles in Ltf-KO mice compared to WT at day 14 after BaCl2
  injection. Scale bar: 60 μm. (N) At 60 days after the first injury, a second injection
  of BaCl2 solution was delivered to the muscle of WT and Ltf-KO mice, and the muscle
  was analyzed at day 5 after the second injury. Scale bar: 30 μm. (O) Average CSA
  of eMyHC-positive fibers in TA muscle at 5 days after the second injury. n = 3 in
  each group. * p< 0.05; ** p < 0.01; NS, not significant.'
