caption: (A) The changes in mechanical pressure pain thresholds in the Control group
  of rats injected with Maslinic acid (5 mg/ml) 1 h in advance followed by TNF-α (0.1 mg/ml)
  were not statistically different from the control group. (B). The expression of
  p-P65, P65, MLCK, MEF2C, and MyoC was detected 2 h after injection of M.A. and TNF-α.
  There was no statistical difference in expression levels between the two groups.
  (C). The mRNA expression levels of MLCK, MEF2C, and MyoC in the M.A. and TNF-α injection
  groups were not significantly different, and GAPDH was used as the internal reference
  mRNA. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.
