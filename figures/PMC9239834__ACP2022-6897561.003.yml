caption: Downregulated UPK3A suppresses the migration and invasion of gastric cancer
  cells. (a) The migration ability of SNU-216 and HGC-27 cells was detected by wound
  healing assay. (b) The invasion ability of SNU-216 and HGC-27 cells was measured
  by Transwell assay. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. Mock group and si-NC group.
