caption: The relative expression of DEGs in the gills from the susceptible family
  S4301 and the resistant family R4347. (A) Inflammation-related genes. (B) Endocytosis-related
  genes. (C) Ribosome genes. (D) Immune-related genes. Vertical bars represent the
  mean ± S.E. (n = 3). Significant differences between R4347 and S4301 at the same
  sampling point are indicated with an asterisk at P < 0.05, and two asterisks at
  P < 0.01.
