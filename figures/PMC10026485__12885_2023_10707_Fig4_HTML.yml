caption: Bioinformatics prediction and experimental verification of TUBA1C. A Functional
  pathway analysis of TUBA1C was performed using matescape enrichment analysis. B
  Pathway activity of the TUBA from GSCA. C Cell cycle was determined in MKN-45 and
  HGC-27 cells transfected D Co-expression of TUBA1C with KI67, E2F1 and PCNA in GC
  were analyzed in cBioPortal using the TCGA database. E The expression of KI-67,
  E2F1 and PCNA in MKN-45 cells transfected with oe-TUBA1C and its control and HGC-27
  cells transfected with si-TUBA1C and its control were detected by Western blotting.
  (The blots were cut prior to hybridisation with antibodies.) Data are mean ± SD.
