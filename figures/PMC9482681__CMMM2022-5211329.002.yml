caption: 'Visualizations of pathway and process enrichment analysis results of DEGs.
  (a) GO term analysis of DEGs. The vertical axis represents the enrichment score
  value enriched on the GO term item, and the horizontal axis represents the name
  of the corresponding GO term item in the GO database. The figure only shows the
  top 15 terms of each category. BP: biological process; CC: cellular component; MF:
  molecular function. (b) KEGG enrichment analysis of DEGs. The top 15 clusters with
  their representative KEGG pathways. The color changes gradually from blue to red,
  which represents the significant level of enrichment to the pathway, and the redder
  the color, the greater the significance. The horizontal axis represents the enrichment
  score of the pathway, the vertical axis represents the corresponding pathway name
  in the KEGG database, and the size of the circle represents the number of genes
  enriched in the pathway.'
