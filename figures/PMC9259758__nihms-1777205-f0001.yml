figure_title: CD14 is critical to TLR3-mediated signaling
caption: (a) Expressions of TLR3 and IL6, are upregulated after treatment with RA
  followed by poly I:C. (b) Pretreatment with RA (1 μM, 48 h) followed by poly I:C
  (0.5 μg/ml, 48 h) resulted in greater expression of TLR3 in human KCs, whereas pretreatment
  with poly I:C followed by RA (same conditions) showed no apparent difference from
  the untreated control. (c) CD14 expression was enhanced after treatment with RA
  in the control. When RA treatment was in conjunction with RARG-siRNA, CD14 expression
  was not enhanced, indicating that RARG is required to regulate CD14 expression.
  Treatment with RA and RARA-siRNA resulted in increased CD14 expression as seen in
  the control, showing that RARA does not play a significant role in this pathway.
  (d) Despite some heterogeneity in β-actin staining in western blots, inhibiting
  the expression of CD14 using CD14-siRNA in human KCs resulted in diminished effects
  of poly I:C treatment (0.5 μg/ml, 48 h). (e) Poly I:C treatment increased the expression
  of TLR3 and nuclear localization of NF-kB, a downstream protein in the TLR3-mediated
  signaling pathway. (f, g) The size of the wound bed was significantly greater for
  Cd14-KO mice than for WT on day 11 after wounding, as can be seen (f) qualitatively
  and (g) quantitatively. (h) WIHN was significantly impaired in Cd14-KO mice when
  treated with poly I:C compared with that in the WT. However, treatment with PBS
  resulted in no significant difference, suggesting that another mechanism might be
  compensating for the lack of CD14. (i) A summary of the key relationships between
  dsRNA, TLR3, CD14, and RA in the pathway signaling for WIHN. Damaged tissues release
  dsRNA, which binds to CD14. CD14 chaperones dsRNA to TLR3 and acts as a coreceptor.
  This activation causes increased endogenous RA synthesis, leading to increased RAR-mediated
  signaling, which then facilitates the expression of hair follicle stem cell factors
  (K15 and K19) and CD14, ultimately resulting in regeneration. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
