caption: 'Identification of benzylacetone (BA) biosynthetic genes via correlation
  analysis at single‐cell resolution. (a) BA biosynthetic pathway proposed based on
  the biochemical function of NaPAL4 and NaPKS1/2/3/4 (solid lines), which has been
  characterized previously. Dashed lines indicate a putative reaction mediated by
  unknown enzymes: Coenzyme A (CoA) ligases and reductases; NaPAL4, Nicotiana attenuata
  phenylalanine ammonia‐lyase 4; NaPKS, N. attenuata polyketide synthase. Genes tested
  in this study are annotated below the arrows. (b) Two correlation analyses display
  different top‐ranked gene profiles. Genes are ranked by their correlation coefficients
  with NaPAL4. Single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐Seq) based analysis (left panel)
  generated more relevant profiles where several phenylpropanoid pathway associated
  genes were included; green bars: putative phenylpropanoid pathway genes, blue bars:
  homologs of transporter (ABC transporter) and transcription factor (ODORANT1) studied
  in petunia. (c) Percentage of genes (y‐axis) that have a given Spearman’s rank correlation
  coefficient (x‐axis) with NaPAL4 expression in scRNA‐Seq and bulk RNA‐Seq. Genes
  encoding CoA ligase, reductases, and polyketide synthases appear in different colors
  on the histograms. Thick lines highlight the CoA ligase, reductase, and polyketide
  synthase most correlated with NaPAL4 in scRNA‐Seq. NaAER1, N. attenuata 2‐alkenal
  reductases 1; NaCNL, N. attenuata cinnamate:CoA ligase; NaIFR, N. attenuata isoflavone
  reductase; Na4CL1, N. attenuata 4‐coumarate:CoA ligase.'
