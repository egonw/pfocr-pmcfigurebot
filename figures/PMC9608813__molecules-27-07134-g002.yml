caption: 'Effects of E. daniellii extract on migration of human dermal fibroblasts.
  (A–D) Human dermal fibroblasts were treated with vehicle (0.1% DMSO), E. daniellii
  extract (1, 5 μg/mL), or VPA (100 μM) for 24 h. (A,B) The in vitro wound-healing
  and transwell assays were performed as described in the Materials and Methods section.
  (A) Representative images of in vitro wound-healing assay and quantitative measurement
  of relative wound-closure rate. (B) Representative images of transwell assay and
  quantitative measurement of relative cell-migrated area. (C) Immunoblotting analysis
  data. (D) ICC staining for β-catenin and collagen I. Nuclei were counterstained
  with DAPI. Arrows indicate nucleus-localized β-catenin. (E) Quantitative measurements
  of intensities of β-catenin and Collagen I for the data from the experiments in  (n
  = 10 taken in three different images). (F,G) Fibroblasts were transfected with β-catenin
  siRNA or negative control for 12 h. After transfection, fibroblasts were treated
  with vehicle (0.1% DMSO), E. daniellii extract (1, 5 μg/mL), or VPA (100 μM) for
  24 h. (F) Immunoblotting analysis data for transfected fibroblasts. (G) Representative
  images of in vitro wound-healing assay of transfected fibroblasts and quantitative
  measurement of wound-closure rate. Original magnification: (A,B), ×40; (D), ×400.
  Values are expressed as means ± SEM. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.005; *** p < 0.0005, significantly
  different from vehicle, control, or as indicated.'
