caption: A TMTC3 inhibitor was identified and verified to enhance the efficacy of
  cisplatin. A. A high-throughput drug screening strategy against TMTC3. B and C.
  The mRNA expression of TMTC3 in ESCC cells treated by allopurinol in different doses
  (B) or different periods (C). D. The protein levels of TMTC3 and its downstream
  pathway treated with different doses of allopurinol. E and F. The ability of cell
  proliferation treated with different doses of allopurinol in KYSE180 (E) and KYSE450
  (F) cells. G and H. Synergistic response to the combination of allopurinol and cisplatin
  in KYSE180 (G) and KYSE450 (H) cells (up). The percentage of clonogenic formation
  was calculated (down). All data are expressed as the mean ± SD. *, p < 0.05; **,
  p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001. n = 3
