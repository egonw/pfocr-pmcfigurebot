caption: Cell viability of ASH-3 and KMH-2 human tumor cells infected with Salmonella.
  The ASH-3 (A) and KMH-2 cells (2 × 104 cells/well) (B) were seeded into 96-well
  plates and incubated at 37 °C for 24 hours. After treatment with various MOI of
  Salmonella for 90 min, each well were loaded with proliferation reagent WST-1. Then,
  the absorbance was read and analyze to measure the cell viability (mean ± SD, n=8).
  (C) For monitoring cell proliferation, ATC cells were treated with various MOI of
  Salmonella for 90 min. Then cells were fixed and stained for BrdU immunoreactivity
  and nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342. The cells were counted under
  a fluorescence microscope (mean ± SD, n=6). (D) After treated with Salmonella (100
  MOI), the ASH-3 and KMH-2 cells were stained with Annexin V and the frequency of
  cells were examined by flow-cytometry (mean ± SD, n=6). *** p < 0.001; ** p < 0.01.
