figure_title: Work model of 181-Rik function in the mitochondria-mediated inflammatory
  response of microglia
caption: LncRNA 181-Rik is translated into a 47-AA mitochondrial micropeptide Stmp1,
  which triggers mitochondrial fission and increases MMP and ROS production. As one
  possible mechanism, these effects may be exerted through the inhibition of Ucp2
  expression by Stmp1. These mitochondrial changes contribute to activating microglia
  as well as the Nlrp3 inflammasome pathway, which results in microglial pyroptosis
  and the release of cytokines, eventually leading to RGC death during retinal IR
  injury. S100a8 and S100a9 appear to function downstream of 181-Rik in the activation
  of inflammasomes.
