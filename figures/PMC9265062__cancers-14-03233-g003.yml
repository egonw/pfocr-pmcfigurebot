caption: Correlation of immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based determination of TSP loss
  with functional downstream tumor suppressor pathway loss, in 28 PDX models of human
  prostate cancer. Shown are scatterplots of marker transcriptional scores (TP53,
  RB1 or PTEN pathway loss) against IHC % labeling indices. The 3 loss scores (rows)
  are regressed on percentage positive by IHC either 1+2+3+ (left column) or 2+3+
  (right column). The red vertical line at 10% corresponds to the threshold for determining
  abnormal or normal based on IHC staining. The blue line is the ordinary least squares
  regression fit. The grey shaded region around each line is a 95% confidence interval
  set for the fit. The correlation (R) and significance of correlation (p-value for
  testing if correlation is 0) are included in each plot in red text.
