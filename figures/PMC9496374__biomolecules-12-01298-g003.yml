caption: (a) The percentage of viable RPE cells decreases in response to AM exposure
  and is protected by IGF-1. Inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway by LY294002 causes a
  reduction in IGF-1 efficacy, while inhibiting MAPK by PD98059 or PD160316 has no
  effect on maintaining RPE cell viability by IGF-1 in the presence of AM. PI3K/Akt
  is the pathway by which IGF-1 protects RPE cells from AM toxicity. (b) Caspase 3/7
  activity in RPE cells approximately doubles in the presence of AM compared to control,
  and IGF-1 attenuates this increase. Inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway by LY294002
  diminishes apoptotic protection from IGF-1, while inhibiting MAPK by PD98059 or
  PD160316 has no effect on the ability of IGF-1 to reduce caspase 3/7 activity in
  the presence of AM [].
