caption: Suppression of the ATM signaling pathway inhibits the replication of PEDV.
  (A,B) Western blots were prepared with extracts from Vero-E6 cells pretreated with
  DMSO, ATM antagonist KU55933 (6 μM) (A), or ATR antagonist VE821 (2 μM) (B) for
  2 h and followed by infection with CV777 (0.5 MOI) in the presence of DMSO or KU55933
  (A), or VE821 (B) for 12, 24, 30 h. (C) The virus titers were measured by PFU assay
  with supernatants harvested from Vero-E6 cells pretreated with DMSO or KU55933 (6
  μM) or VE821 (2 μM) for 2 h before and during infection with CV777 (0.1 MOI) for
  12 and 24 h. (D,E) Western blots were prepared with extracts from Vero-E6 cells
  transfected with scramble or 50 nM siATM (D), or siChk2 (E) for 48 h and followed
  by infection with 0.1 MOI CV777 for 6 and 12 h. (F,G) The experiment was performed
  as in (D,E), except the cells and supernatants were collected for PFU assay (* p
  < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001).
