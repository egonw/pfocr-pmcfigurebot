caption: 'The expression of NEAT1, miR-101 and VEGF-C in BC and the effects on BC
  cells. A The expression of NEAT1 and VEGF-C in the tumour tissues was significantly
  higher than that in the normal tissues. The expression of miR-101 in tumour tissues
  was significantly lower than that in the normal tissues. ***p < 0.001 tumour tissues
  versus normal tissues. B The results of Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed that BC patients
  with high NEAT1 expression presented poor recurrence-free survival. p = 0.026 high
  NEAT1 expression group versus low NEAT1 expression group (HR = 2.042, 95% CI 1.067–3.906).
  C After 24 h, the proliferation of the cells in the NEAT1 group was significantly
  higher than that in the CON and NC groups in both T24 and 5637 cells. **p < 0.01
  NEAT1 group versus CON and NC groups. D, E The qualitative results of the migration
  and invasion assays showed that the migration and invasion of the cells in the NEAT1
  group were significantly higher than those in the CON and NC groups, both in T24
  and 5637 cells. **p < 0.01 NEAT1 group versus CON and NC groups. F The mRNA expression
  of NEAT1 and VEGF-C was significantly increased after NEAT1 transfection, both in
  T24 and 5637 cells. **p < 0.01 NEAT1 group versus CON and NC groups. The mRNA expression
  of miR-101 was significantly decreased after NEAT1 transfection. **p < 0.01 NEAT1
  group versus CON and NC groups. G VEGF-C protein expression was significantly increased
  after NEAT1 transfection, both in T24 and 5637 cells (Additional file : Figure S1).
