caption: 'Transcriptomic modifications after UB‐SCG‐51 treatment. (A) Schematic representation
  of RNA‐sequencing process. (B) Volcano plot analysis. (C). KEGG pathway enrichment
  after UB‐SCG‐51 treatment. (D) GO process enriched after UB‐SCG‐51 treatment. (E–H)
  For qPCR validation genes: (E) Amd1, (F) Eif3j, (G) Gpr156, and (H) Sycp1 gene expression
  levels. Values presented are the mean ± SEM. Groups were compared by one‐way ANOVA
  and post hoc Tukey''s test; (n = 4 per group (Outliers: n = 1 WT control in Amd1
  and Eif3j gene expression levels; n = 1 5XFAD control, and one in 5XFAD treated
  in Sycp1 gene expression levels); *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01.'
