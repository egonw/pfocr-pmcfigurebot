caption: 'The effect of azilsartan on the migration ability of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
  breast cancer cell lines. (A) Representative photos taken at 0 and 48 h for untreated
  and treated cells with the IC50 of azilsartan after making the scratch area for
  MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. Magnification: ×40. (B,C) Percentage of the wound
  closure for MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cancer cell lines, respectively. Data represent
  mean ± SD, n = 3. Significant difference was analyzed by student t test, where **
  p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, compared to untreated cells.'
