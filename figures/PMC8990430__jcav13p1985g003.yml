caption: (A,B) ASF1b mRNA levels of GC vs. NAT in ZJU cohort. (B) Relative expression
  of ASF1b mRNA in GC tissues and their corresponding NAT was determined by qRT-PCR
  and expressed as -ΔΔCT (****P<0.0001). (C) Representative immunohistochemical staining
  of ASF1b in GC tissues and NAT (scale bar = 10 um). (D) A GC tissue microarray (TMA)
  (n = 160) indicated that the expression of ASF1b was upregulated in 65% of GC tissues.
  (E) The protein expression levels of ASF1b in 160 paired TMA (****P<0.0001).
article_title: ASF1b is a novel prognostic predictor associated with cell cycle signaling
  pathway in gastric cancer.
