caption: CSE1L and AURKA pathway gene high p53 WT NSCLC cell lines are more sensitive
  to mocetinostat and CSE1L depletion. (A) The gene expression of CSE1L and the AURKA
  pathway in 9 p53 WT NSCLC cell lines was extracted from the CCLE RNAseq database.
  The median expression level of each gene was utilized as a cutoff (1 or 0) to determine
  high or low expression. The cell lines were then ranked based on the sum of the
  genes' high expression levels, referred to as the gene set score (GS#). (B) The
  indicated cell lines were treated with vehicle or the indicated doses of mocetinostat
  (1 µM) for 72 h and then analyzed with MTT assay. Average (8 replicates) relative
  MTT absorbance is presented with SD indicated. (C) The indicated cell lines were
  transfected with control siRNA or CSE1L siRNA for 48 h and then plated for colony
  formation assay. Average (triplicate) % colony formation is presented with SD indicated.
  Representative images are presented. There are significant differences (p < 0.05)
  between A549/H460 and the other four cell lines in CSE1L treated conditions. (D)
  A549 p53+/+ and p53−/− cells were treated with vehicle or the indicated doses of
  mocetinostat (0.5 µM or 1 µM) and/or PTX (0.5 nM or 1 nM) for 72 h and then grown
  in drug free media for colony formation assay. Average (triplicate) % colony formation
  is presented with SD indicated. Representative images are presented. There is a
  synergistic effect of mocetinostat and PTX in p53+/+ cells (CI < 1) but not in p53−/− cells
  (CI > 1) (see CompuSyn analysis in Fig. ).
article_title: CSE1L is a negative regulator of the RB-DREAM pathway in p53 wild-type
  NSCLC and can be targeted using an HDAC1/2 inhibitor.
