caption: m6A RNA binding proteins participate in ESCA progression in an m6A-dependent
  way. (A) Ref. [] IGF2BP2 interacted with SNHG12 to enhance mRNA stability of CTNNB1,
  elevated expression of Î²-catenin encoded by CTNNB1, activated Wnt signaling pathway
  and thus facilitated proliferation, migration, EMT and stemness of ESCC cells; (B)
  Ref. [] IGF2BP2 interacted with FOXP4-AS1, enhanced FOXP4 mRNA stability, upregulated
  FOXP4 expression and promoted proliferation of ESCC cells; (C) Ref. [] CCAT2 alleviated
  inhibition of IGF2BP2 by miR-200b and elevated IGF2BP2 expression, which upregulated
  expression of TK1 and facilitated proliferation, migration and invasion of ESCC
  cells; (D) Ref. [] HNRNPA2B1 bound to m6A modification sites of miR-17-92 cluster,
  enhanced expression of miR-17-92 cluster and facilitated proliferation of ESCC cells;
  (E) Ref. [] Interaction of HNRNPC with LBX2-AS1 enhanced ZEB1 and ZEB2 mRNA stability,
  upregulated expression of ZEB1 and ZEB2 and then promoted migration and EMT of ESCC
  cells.
