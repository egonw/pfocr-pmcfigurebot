caption: Differentiation trajectory and cell fate decision analysed by pseudotime
  analysis. (a–d) The cell ordering along the differentiation trajectory successively
  presented by pseudotime states, samples, branch states and cell types. (e) Heatmap
  of the top 50 significantly changed genes of 9 cell states. The description of these
  genes is given in . (f) Representative genes of four branch points were selected
  to show their expression trends before and after cell differentiation. (g–j) Heatmap
  of the top 100 significantly changed genes discovered by the Branched expression
  analysis modelling (BEAM) function from monocle in four branch points. The detail
  information of these genes is given in . (k) Brief chart of cell fate decision in
  the tea tender leaves.
