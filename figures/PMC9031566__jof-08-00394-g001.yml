caption: 'Role of cdc42 in the asexual cycle in vitro of B. bassiana. (A) Diameters
  of SDAY colonies incubated for 7 days after initiated with ~103 conidia at the optimal
  regime. (B) Conidial yields measured from the SDAY cultures during a 7 day incubation
  after initiated by spreading 100 μL aliquots of a 107 conidia/mL suspension at the
  optimal regime. (C–E) GT50 (h), LT50 (min), and LD50 (J/cm2) estimates as the respective
  indices of conidial quality for the time length of 50% germination at 25 °C, tolerance
  to a wet-heat stress at 45 °C and resistance to UVB irradiation. * p < 0.05 in Tukey’s
  HSD tests. Error bars: SDs from three replicates.'
