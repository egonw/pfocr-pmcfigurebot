caption: 'Schematic illustration showing the workflow of the study, involving the
  metabolomic analysis of biological samples from ARDS patients and healthy controls.
  Blood and urine samples were collected at day 1, day 3, and day 7 after ARDS onset.
  Blood and urine samples were also collected from healthy controls. Biological samples
  were analyzed for their metabolic profiles. ARDS: acute respiratory distress syndrome;
  LC-MS: liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.'
