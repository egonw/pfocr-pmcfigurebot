figure_title: β-catenin promotes PBMSC vitality and long-term survival
caption: 'The experiments were divided into the following groups: transfection of
  vehicle (-), lentivirus vector encoding β-catenin (oeβ-catenin), β-catenin shRNA
  (shβ-catenin), and β-catenin or siRNA (oeβ-catenin plus shβ-catenin). a The ability
  of all groups of PBMSCs to form clones was tested by cell colony formation assays
  and crystal violet staining. b Quantitative analysis of the number of cell clones
  in (a). c The growth curve of all groups of PBMSCs at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 d.
  d The viability of PBMSCs after 70 days of culture was tested by the MTS method.
  e β-Galactosidase staining (black arrowheads) was used to investigate cellular senescence
  in all groups of PBMSCs. Scale bars = 100 µm. f Quantitative analysis of the ratio
  of senescent PBMSCs to total PBMSCs in (e). g The apoptosis level of all groups
  of PBMSCs was assessed by flow cytometry using Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining.
  All graphical data show the means ± SEMs. P < 0.05: * vs. the vehicle group, # vs.
  the oeβ-catenin group, Δ vs. the shβ-catenin group, n = 10 in each group.'
