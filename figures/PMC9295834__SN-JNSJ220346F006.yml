caption: 'Chemogenetic activation of a Gq-coupled pathway in neurons, but not astrocytes,
  resets SCN ensemble phase. A, Schematic showing cell type-specific targeting of
  Gq-coupled DREADDs to neurons (Syn-hM3Dq::mCherry), but not astrocytes in the intact
  SCN network (left) alongside representative PMT traces showing acute vehicle (middle)
  and 100 nM CNO (right) treatment during the CT0 to CT6 time window. The treatment
  interval is shown as a vertical line and colored according to treatment: vehicle
  (gray) or CNO (blue). B, Summary peak amplitude data arranged by phase window of
  treatment showing paired recordings at that window for SCN with neuronally expressed
  Gq-coupled DREADDs treated with vehicle (gray, N ≥ 7 at each phase) or 100 nM CNO
  (blue, N ≥ 7 at each phase). Statistics: Sidak''s multiple-comparisons test, **p
  = 0.006, ****p < 0.0001. C, Summary cycle amplitude data arranged by phase window
  of treatment showing paired recordings at that window for SCN with neuronally expressed
  Gq-coupled DREADDs treated with vehicle (gray, N ≥ 7 at each phase) or 100 nM CNO
  (blue, N ≥ 7 at each phase). Statistics: Sidak''s multiple-comparisons test, *p
  = 0.02, ***p = 0.0006. D, Summary phase-shift data arranged by phase window of treatment
  showing paired recordings at that phase window for SCN with neuronally expressed
  Gq-coupled DREADDs treated with vehicle (gray, N ≥ 7 at each phase) or 100 nM CNO
  (blue, N ≥ 7 at each phase). Statistics: Sidak''s multiple-comparisons test, *p
  ≤ 0.029. E, Schematic showing cell-type-specific targeting of Gq-coupled DREADDs
  to astrocytes (GFAP-hM3Dq::mCherry), but not neurons in the intact SCN network (left)
  alongside representative PMT traces showing acute vehicle (middle) and 100 nM CNO
  (right) treatment during the CT0 to CT6 time window. The treatment interval is shown
  as a vertical line and colored according to treatment: vehicle (gray) or CNO (pink).
  F, Summary peak amplitude data arranged by phase window of treatment showing paired
  recordings at that window for SCN with astrocytically expressed Gq-coupled DREADDs
  treated with vehicle (gray, N ≥ 5 at each phase) or 100 nM CNO (pink, N ≥ 5 at each
  phase). G, Summary cycle amplitude data arranged by phase window of treatment showing
  paired recordings at that window for SCN with astrocytically expressed Gq-coupled
  DREADDs treated with vehicle (gray, N ≥ 5 at each phase) or 100 nM CNO (pink, N
  ≥ 5 at each phase). H, Summary phase-shift data arranged by phase window of treatment
  showing paired recordings at that phase window for SCN with astrocytically expressed
  Gq-coupled DREADDs treated with vehicle (gray, N ≥ 5 at each phase) or 100 nM CNO
  (pink, N ≥ 5 at each phase). In all histogram plots, individual points joined by
  lines represent individual slices with paired treatment and histogram bars with
  error bars represent the mean ± SEM.'
