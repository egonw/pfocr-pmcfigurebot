caption: Effects of SAA on NETosis and Src/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway in lung tissues
  and plasma of ALI mice. (a) Immunofluorescence assay of MPO and citrullinated histones
  (Cit-H3) in lung tissue at 24 h after ALI modeling and administration of SAA (10 mg/kg)
  or DEX (5 mg/kg) (scale bar, 50 μm). (b) The levels of MPO-DNA complexes in the
  plasma of mice. (c) Protein expression in lung homogenate and the relative quantification
  of p-Src/Src, p-Raf/Raf, p-MEK/MEK, and p-ERK/ERK (mean ± SD, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p <
  0.001, n = 4 or 6 for each group).
