figure_title: Impad1, a Golgi-resident protein, alters Golgi morphology and vesicular
  trafficking
caption: (A–H) Confocal images of the Golgi (GM130, green) and nuclei (DAPI, magenta)
  in 393P vector or Impad1-overexpressing cells (A) as well as in 344SQ scramble or
  shImpad1 cells (E). Scatterplots show the number of Golgi fragments/cell (n = 75;
  B and F), average size of individual Golgi fragments/cell (n = 75; C and G), fluorescence
  intensity of the Golgi (n = 50; D), and normalized Golgi area (n = 50; H).(I and
  J) VSV-G assay confocal images of EGFP-VSV-G-transfected 393P vector or Impad1-overexpressing
  cells (I) and 344SQ scramble or shImpad1 cells (J). Green, total VSV-G; red, surface
  VSV-G. Scatterplots (right) show the ratio of surface to total VSV-G signal intensity/cell.
  n = 20; statistical outliers were removed.Scale bars, 10 μm. See also . Data are
  represented as mean ± SD. Each experiment had 3 technical replicates and 2 biological
  replicates. Significance by Student’s t test. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.002.
