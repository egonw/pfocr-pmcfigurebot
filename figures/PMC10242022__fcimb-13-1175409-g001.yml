caption: Schematic model of the role of protein kinases in glycolysis, the TCA cycle,
  and the pantothenate pathways in T. gondii. The GT1 transporter is responsible for
  the internalization of glucose to the cytosol. Kinases in the cytosol, apicoplast,
  and mitochondria are highlighted and listed. The apicoplast displays a PEP transporter
  represented as APT in Toxoplasma and TPT in Plasmodium. The extrusion of excessive
  lactate and pyruvate produced by glycolysis is exported by the FNT transporter,
  contributing to the acidification of the parasitophorous vacuole and parasite release.
  Tachyzoites can synthesize or import pantothenate (Pan) from the host cell, but
  the Pan transporter is still uncharacterized (UNC). Besides the kinases that act
  in glycolysis, mitochondria, and apicoplast, kinases in the pantothenate pathway
  are also important in converting pantothenate to coenzyme-A (CoA) used in other
  biochemical pathways.
