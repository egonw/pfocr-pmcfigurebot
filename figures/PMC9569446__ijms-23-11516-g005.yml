caption: Pathway analysis after METTL3 silencing. (a) Number of genes up-regulated
  (left) or down-regulated (right) in each cell line or common between the two cell
  lines (intersection of the sets). List of pathways and the number of genes involved
  in each for up-regulated (b) and down-regulated (c) genes. The x-axis shows the
  number of genes involved in each pathway.
