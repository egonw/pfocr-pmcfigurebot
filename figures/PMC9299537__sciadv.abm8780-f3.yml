figure_title: KRASG12C inhibition enhances tumor cell–intrinsic IFN responses
caption: '(A) qPCR analysis of IFN-induced genes in MRTX1257 (100 nM, 24 hours) and/or
  recombinant IFNγ (100 ng/ml)–treated 3LL ΔNRAS cells (2−ΔΔCT, normalized to control
  sample for all genes, n = 6, paired t test, mean + SEM). (B) Protein validation
  of IFN response regulation by KRAS. Left: Percentage of CXCL9-positive cells as
  measured by flow cytometry on 3LL ΔNRAS cells after treatment with MRTX1257 and/or
  IFNγ. Right: Concentration of CXCL9 secreted to the medium of 3LL ΔNRAS cells after
  treatment with MRTX1257 and/or IFNγ, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
  (normalized to control sample, n = 3, paired t test, mean + SEM for both). (C) Same
  as (A) using KPB6G12C (n = 4) and CT26G12C (n = 3) cell lines. (D) qPCR analysis
  of IFN-induced genes in 3LL ΔNRAS cells treated with IFNγ only or IFNγ and MRTX1257
  in the presence of 48 hours of Mock or Myc siRNA (2−ΔΔCT, normalized to IFNγ only–treated
  sample for all genes, n = 3, paired t test, mean + SEM). (E) qPCR analysis of IFN
  pathway genes in human KRASG12V-ER pneumocytes after treatment with 4-OHT and/or
  recombinant IFNγ for 24 hours (normalized to control sample, n = 4, paired t test,
  mean + SEM).'
