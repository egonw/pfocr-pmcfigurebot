caption: Effect of EA on apoptosis and necroptosis of human hepatocellular carcinoma
  cells. (A and B) Western blot analysis of the expression levels of apoptosis and
  necroptosis-related proteins at 48 h in MHCC97-L and HCCLM3 cells. β-actin was used
  as a control. (C and D) Effect of EA on apoptosis in MHCC97-L and HCCLM3 cells,
  as determined by flow cytometry. n=5. (E) Viability of MHCC97-L and HCCLM3 cells
  treated with or without apoptosis or necroptosis inhibitors was measured by Cell
  Counting Kit 8 assays. n=6. All data are shown as the mean ± SD. ***P<0.001. EA,
  eupalinolide A; C-, cleaved; p-, phosphorylated.
article_title: Eupalinolide A induces autophagy via the ROS/ERK signaling pathway
  in hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo.
