caption: 'Illustrative scheme and characterization of the synthesized polypeptides,
  MTem, and MTem/Los. a) Illustration of engineering anti‐oxidative and anti‐inflammatory
  MTem/Los with prolonged ocular surface retention time and its therapeutic effect
  and mechanism via suppressing ROS‐mediated p38 MAPK pathway and breaking the vicious
  cycle in DED. b) X‐band EPR spectra of Tem and MTem in DMSO. c) The hydrodynamic
  diameter of MTem and MTem/Los. d) TEM image of MTem/Los. The scale bar is 200 nm.
  e) Changes of hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of MTem/Los over different
  times measured by DLS. f) In vitro drug release profile of Los encapsulated MTem/Los
  micelles with/without 5 µg mL−1 lysozyme in PBS. g) Antioxidant capacity of Tem
  and MTem by measuring the hydrolysis degree of H2O2 through a hydrogen peroxide
  assay kit. Inset pictures: Color change of PEG‐b‐(Lys‐graft‐Tem‐co‐Phe) before (left)
  and after (right) the addition of ascorbic acid. Data were presented as mean ± SD;
  n = 3.'
