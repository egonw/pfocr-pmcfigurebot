caption: 'Activin B morphologically and molecularly activates hepatic stellate cells
  (HSCs). (A) LX‐2 cells were treated with bovine serum albumin (BSA; 100 ng/ml),
  activin A (100 ng/ml), activin B (100 ng/ml), their combination (100 ng/ml each),
  or transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1; 5 ng/ml) for 24 h and then underwent 4′,
  6‐diamidino‐2‐phenylindole (DAPI) staining. (B) LX‐2 cells were treated with activin
  A (100 ng/ml), activin B (100 ng/ml), or TGFβ1 (5 ng/ml) for 6 h. Total RNAs were
  isolated, reverse‐transcribed to complementary DNA, and then subjected to microarray
  analysis using HG‐U133 plus two chips (n = 6). Pie chart shows the numbers of genes
  commonly or uniquely regulated by the individual ligands. (C) The top 10 signaling
  pathways revealed by Ingenuity Canonical Pathway analysis of the 877 target genes
  shared by these three ligands. (D) Heat map of the 20 genes exhibiting the highest
  magnitudes of up‐regulation or down‐regulation in response to these three ligands.
  (E–G) LX‐2 cells were treated with vehicle, activin A (100 ng/ml), activin B (100 ng/ml),
  or their combination (100 ng/ml of each) for 24 h. (H) Mouse primary HSCs were exposed
  to vehicle, activin A (100 ng/ml), activin B (100 ng/ml), or their combination (100 ng/ml
  of each) for 24 h. The expression of the genes indicated was assessed with quantitative
  real‐time PCR. Data are shown as means of fold changes relative to vehicle controls
  ± SEM (n = 4–6). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001 via two‐way
  ANOVA compared with vehicle controls. Abbreviations: ACTA2, smooth muscle alpha‐2
  actin; ACVR, activin A receptor; ACVR1, activin A receptor type 1; ADAMTSL, a disintegrin
  and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motif‐like protein; BMP, bone morphogenetic

  factor; MGP, matrix Gla protein; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; TMEPAI, transmembrane
  prostate androgen–induced protein; TRIM, tripartite motif family; VEGFA, vascular
  endothelial growth factor alpha.'
