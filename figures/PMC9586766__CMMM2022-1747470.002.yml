caption: miR-146a-5p targets TRAF6. (a) miR-146a-5p and TRAF6-3′UTR binding site as
  indicated by prediction software BiBiServ and RNAfold. (b) Dual-luciferase detection
  of miR-146a-5p and TRAF6-3′UTR binding. (c, d) qPCR and WB detection of the expression
  of TRAF6 after adding miR-146a-5p mimics. Band analysis software is ImageJ (version
  1.8.0_172). (e, f) qPCR and WB inspection of the expression of TRAF6 in AR42J cells
  treated with 0, 2.5, 5, and 10 nM cerulein. Band analysis software is ImageJ (version
  1.8.0_172). ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001. The experiments were repeated
  three times, the statistical test was a two-tailed test, and errors bars in the
  figures represent standard deviation (SD).
