caption: SIRT4 expression and localization in dairy cow mammary tissue. (A) The localization
  of SIRT4 in mammary tissue in control and heat stress-treated group. (Bâ€“D) The protein
  and mRNA levels of SIRT4 and HSP70 in mammary tissues were examined by Western blot
  and qRT-PCR after heat stress treatment. (E) SIRT4 was colocalized with mitochondria
  in BMECs.
