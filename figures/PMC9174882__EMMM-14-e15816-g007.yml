figure_title: Sensitivity of PTCL to ATR pathway inhibition
caption: 'Sanger screen IC50 drug sensitivity data (IC50 values) for DDR inhibitors
  targeting ATR, CHK1/2, and Wee1 in T‐ALL, PTCL (DEL, KARPAS‐299, and SUP‐M2), and
  pan‐cancer cell lines. ANOVA P = 0.413 (AZD6738, ATR inhibitor), P = 0.750 (AZD772,
  CHK1/2 inhibitor), P = 0.119 (MK‐8776, ATR inhibitor), and 0.282 (AZD1775, Wee1
  inhibitor). Bars represent SEM of biological replicates.PTCL (red) and T‐ALL (yellow)
  human cell lines were dosed in vitro with AZD6738 for 72 h and viable cell numbers
  assayed by luminescence readout using Cell TiterGlo. Average IC50 values from three
  experiments are plotted. Bars represent SEM.Representative dose–response curve of
  AZD6738. PC9 and NCI‐H197 lung cancer cell lines are DDR inhibitor sensitive and
  resistant, respectively, and included as drug sensitivity controls. Dotted line
  represents 50% normalized luminescence levels.Kaplan–Meyer curve of mice implanted
  IV with mPTCL splenocytes and dosed with ATR inhibitor ceralasertib (AZD6738) 50 mg/kg
  PO QD (n = 9) or vehicle (n = 10). On day 38, mice on AZD6738 therapy were randomized
  to discontinue therapy (n = 4, group A) or continue therapy for a further 14 days
  (n = 5, group B). The dosing period is indicated by gray arrows. Log‐rank test P = 0.0004
  (ATR group A, stop day 38) and P = 0.0001 (ATR, stop day 52) versus the vehicle
  control arm. Group A versus B: P = 0.0040. Median survival times: days 23 (vehicle),
  47 (A), and 54 (B).Flow cytometry dot plots of TCRvβ8mid ICOShi infiltrating TCRβ+
  T‐cells from spleens. Mice were implanted IV with mPTCL splenocytes and administered
  intermittent AZD6738 (50 mg/kg PO QD) for 71 days post‐implant (see Appendix Fig
  ). Tumor burden representative of 6 out of 8 mice on prolonged ATR inhibition therapy
  (day 71 post‐implant) is compared with endpoint spleens from a vehicle‐treated mouse
  and an ATR‐treated mouse that relapsed off‐therapy. A wildtype C57bl/6J spleen is
  shown in blue. Percentages of total viability marker‐negative cells are gated.Western
  blot for γH2AX relative to total H2AX levels of spleen lysates from mice dosed for
  71 days with AZD6738 (ATR; n = 4) relative to untreated mPTCL spleens taken at endpoint
  (n = 6). T‐test P = 2.70E‐06. PC9 cells dosed in vitro 24 h with 1 µM aphidicolin
  (Aph; an inhibitor of DNA replication) or with AZD6738 (ATR) are positive controls
  for DNA damage. Bars represent SEM. ***P < 0.001.'
