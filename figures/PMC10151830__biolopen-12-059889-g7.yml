caption: ZIKV-induced neuronal progenitor subtype-specific metabolic alterations.
  Schematic representation of the differential metabolic dysregulation caused by ZIKV
  replication in cortical progenitors at different stages of maturation. (A) Increased
  abundance and size of lipid droplets with reduced mitochondrial size and abundance
  (blue colour) in Env +ve early hi-NPCs during early stages of ZIKV replication.
  (B) Normal abundance of lipid droplets, normal mitochondria size and abundance (yellow
  colour) in Env +ve late hi-NPCs during early stages of ZIKV replication. (C) Normal
  abundance of lipid droplets, normal mitochondria size and abundance (yellow colour)
  in Env +ve early hi-NPCs during late stages of ZIKV replication. (D) Normal abundance
  of lipid droplets with reduced mitochondrial size and abundance (blue colour) in
  Env +ve late hi-NPCs during late stages of ZIKV replication. Black arrows representing
  normal fluxes of each main metabolic pathway. Black dotted arrows representing potentially
  dysregulated metabolic pathways. Red arrows highlighting increased pathways assessed
  by protein expression. Gene/protein names in red corresponding to increased levels
  whilst those in black corresponding to unaltered levels compared to non-infected
  controls.
