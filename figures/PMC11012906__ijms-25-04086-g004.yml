caption: 'Analysis of RECK protein expression by Western blot after miR-21 silencing.
  Total cellular proteins were obtained from 1 × 105 CaSki (panel A) and SiHa cells
  (panel B) per well in a six-well plate containing DMEM at 37 °C with 5% CO2 after
  48 h of transfection with pSilencer 1.0-U6 empty vector plasmid or pSIMIR21-5P plasmids
  (lane 1: MW, molecular weight; lane 2: NT, non-transfected cells; lanes 3 to 5 cells
  transfected with pSilencer 1.0-U6 plasmid; lanes 6 to 8 cells transfected with pSIMIR21-5P
  plasmid). The proteins were separated in 12% SDS-PAGE and were transferred to nitrocellulose
  membranes, which were incubated with each antibody. The RECK and beta-actin protein
  expression were detected with each antibody, respectively, after transfection with
  pSilencer 1.0-U6 and pSIMIR21-5P plasmids. Protein amounts were analyzed in the
  immunoblots. Immunoblot bands were digitalized and analyzed by densitometer using
  the ImageJ program, and data were analyzed by RECK fold change (mean ± SD). The
  values were normalized with the NT cells and are presented as mean ± SD. p values
  < 0.05 are indicated with an asterisk.'
