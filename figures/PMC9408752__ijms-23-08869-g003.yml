caption: DAPT treatment reduced the expression of genes related to the cell cycle
  and DNA replication. (A) Heatmap of differential expressed genes in cell cycle pathway
  (n = 3). (B) Heatmap of differentially expressed genes in the DNA replication pathway
  (n = 3). (C) The mRNA expression levels of selected genes were determined by qRT-PCR
  (n = 4). Bars represent a significant difference between groups (p < 0.05).
