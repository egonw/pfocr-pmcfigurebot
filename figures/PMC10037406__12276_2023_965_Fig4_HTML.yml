figure_title: Regulation of STING and the downstream signaling pathway
caption: Upon binding to cGAMP, STING undergoes a conformational change, and then,
  the dimers oligomerize. STING oligomerization recruits TBK1 and promotes autotransphosphorylation
  of TBK1 at the ERGIC. Activated TBK1 phosphorylates the CTT of STING to generate
  IRF3 docking sites and then phosphorylates the recruited IRF3.
