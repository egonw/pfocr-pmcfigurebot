caption: Pathological implications in cross talk between TREM2 and other AD domains.
  a) Cross talk between TREM2 and Aβ. b) Cross talk between TREM2 and tau. c) Cross
  talk between TREM2 and APOE. d) Cross talk between TREM2 and PLCγ2. All these cross
  talk features play a crucial role in novel pathophysiology leading to neuronal cell
  dysfunction.
