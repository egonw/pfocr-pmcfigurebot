caption: 'Effect of ADMSCs-derived exosomes on NRG-1/HER2 signaling in cardiac tissue
  of DOX/Trz-treated rats: (A,B) HER2 and ERB4 concentration determined by ELISA.
  Results are expressed as mean ± SEM; and (C) mRNA levels of cardiac NRG-1. Data
  are expressed as median (maximum, minimum). **, significant compared to Group I
  at p ˂ 0.01; ****, significant compared to Group I at p ˂ 0.0001; ##, significant
  compared to Group II at p ˂ 0.01; ####, significant compared to Group II at p ˂
  0.0001; $, significant compared to Group III at p ˂ 0.05; n = 6.'
