caption: Stable isotope tracing in Par-C5 shδ110 cells with [13C5,15N2] glutamine.
  Par-C5 cells were starved of glutamine for 18h and then incubated with complete
  media substituted with labeled glutamine for 0, 1, and 6 h. A, schematic of relevant
  glutamine metabolism pathways. Top legend indicates labels for 13C (red circle),
  12C (white circle), 15N (blue circle), or 14N (gray circle) in glutamine pathway
  schematic. Multi-colored legend (boxes) shows 13C15N isotopologs for all tracing
  graphs. B, 13C,15N enrichment in nucleotides. C, q-RT PCR for GLS1, GLS2, and GLUL
  was performed on Par-C5 cells depleted of PKCδ (shδ110 or shδ680) or untargeted
  control shRNA (shNT). Graph represents fold change in mRNA expression (ΔΔCT) as
  compared to shNT = 1. A representative experiment, including triplicate samples,
  is shown. q-RT PCR experiments were repeated a minimum of three times. Error bars
  represent SEM, statistics represent 1-way ANOVA, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗p <
  0.0001. GLS1, glutaminase-1; GLS2, glutaminase-2; GLUL, glutamine synthetase; PKCδ,
  protein kinase Cδ.
