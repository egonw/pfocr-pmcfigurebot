caption: 'THBS2 mediated the OD of VICs via inhibition of Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway.
  (a) ALP activity of VICs transfected with shTHBS2 and treated with LY294002 was
  detected through colorimetry after the induction of OD. (b) Calcic nodule formation
  of VICs transfected with shTHBS2 and treated with LY294002 was measured by Alizarin
  red staining after the induction of OD (scale: 200 μm; magnification: ×100). (c)
  and (d) Relative mRNA expressions of osteocalcin, Runx2, SPARC, COL1A2, and COL1A1
  (c) and SPP1, CTGF, MMP-2, and MMP-13 (d) in VICs transfected with shTHBS2 and treated
  with LY294002 were determined through qRT-PCR after the induction of OD. GAPDH was
  a loading control. ###p < 0.001 vs. vector group; ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗∗p < 0.01 vs. shTHBS2
  group; ∧∧p < 0.01; ∧∧∧p < 0.001 vs. LY294002 group. All experiments were repeated
  independently at least three times. Data were performed as the means ± standard deviation.
  Abbreviations: THBS2: thrombospondin 2; OD: osteogenic differentiation; VICs: valve
  interstitial cells; ALP: alkaline phosphatase; shTHBS2: short hairpin THBS2; Runx2:
  Runt-related transcription factor-2; SPARC: secreted protein acidic and rich in
  cysteine; COL1A: collagen type I alpha; SPP1: secreted phosphoprotein 1; CTGF: connective
  tissue growth factor; MMP-: matrix metalloproteinase-; qRT-PCR: quantitative reverse
