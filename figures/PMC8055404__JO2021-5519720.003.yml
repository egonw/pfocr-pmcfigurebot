caption: The signaling pathway associated with lncRNA UCA1 in GI cancer. LncRNA UCA1
  induces EMT by regulating EMT key proteins. It also promotes the activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  signaling pathway, ERK/MMP9 signaling pathway, ERK signaling pathway, Hippo pathway,
  WISP2/Î²-catenin signaling pathway, and MAPKAPK2/HSP27 signaling pathway by regulating
  their key proteins. Additionally, lncRNA UCA1 also interacts with EZH2 to regulate
  protein expression.
