caption: 'Multivariate Cox analyses and potential regulatory signaling pathways of
  CDKs. (A) Multivariate Cox analyses of clinical features and CDKs. (B) Related regulatory
  pathway prediction of CDKs based on GSEA. The pathways in the figure are as follows:
  1, basal cell carcinoma; 2, cell cycle; 3, colorectal cancer; 4, DNA replication;
  5, fatty acid metabolism; 6, glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate;
  7, hedgehog signaling pathway; 8, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway; 9, p53 signaling
  pathway; 10, protein export; 11, RNA degradation; 12, neuroactive ligand receptor
  interaction. The enrichment processes of all the related pathways are shown below
  as bar codes. *p < 0.05 or ***p < 0.001 in the multivariate Cox analyses were considered
  statistically significant.'
