caption: Changes in transcriptional levels of genes for cytokinin and auxin biosynthesis
  and signal transduction. (A) Proposed biosynthetic and signal transduction pathway
  for cytokinin. DMAPP, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate; IPT, isopentenyl transferases;
  CYP, cytochrome P450 enzyme; LOG, LONELY GUY; AHPs, histidine phosphotransfer proteins;
  CRF, cytokinin response factors; B-AAR, type-B response regulators; A-AAR, type-A
  response regulators. (B) DEGs involved in cytokinin biosynthesis and the signal
  transduction pathway. For each gene, the relative expression (rSmSPL2-OE2 vs. control
  and rSmSPL2-OE7 vs. control) was expressed in Log2FC. Blue boxes (gene expression
  is down-regulated); Red boxes (gene expression is up-regulated). * indicates differentially
  expressed genes. (C) Concentrations of cytokinin in root extracts from control and
  transgenic line rSmSPL2-OE2 and rSmSPL2-OE7. *, values are significantly different
  from control at p < 0.05 by Student’s t-test. (D) Proposed biosynthetic and signal
  transduction pathways for auxin. TAA, Tryptophan aminotransferase of Arabidopsis;
  TAR, Tryptophan aminotransferase related; YUC, YUCCA; AIM, Indole-3-acetamide hydrolase;
  AAO, Aldehyde oxidase; TIR1, Transport Inhibitor Response 1; AUX/IAA, auxin/indole
  acetic acid; GH3, Gretchen Hagen 3; SAUR, small auxin-up RNA. (E) DEGs involved
  in auxin biosynthesis and signal transduction pathway. For each gene, the relative
  expression (rSmSPL2-OE2 vs. control and rSmSPL2-OE7 vs. control) was expressed in
  Log2FC. Blue boxes (gene expression is down-regulated); Red boxes (gene expression
  is up-regulated). * indicates differentially expressed genes. Gene ID were listed
  in . (F) Concentrations of auxin in root extracts from control and transgenic line
  rSmSPL2-OE2 and rSmSPL2-OE7. **, values are significantly different from control
  at p < 0.01 by Student’s t-test.
