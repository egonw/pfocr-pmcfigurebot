figure_title: The PTGIS/PGI2 signaling pathway accelerates EMs progression in vivo
caption: a Schematic of the EMs model establishment process. b Collected ectopic lesions
  in the abdominopelvic cavity of EMs model mice. c, d Iloprost (a stable PGI2 analog)
  treatment (20 mg/kg) (n = 23) increased the weight and number of ectopic lesions
  in EMs model mice compared to control mice (n = 22). e Collected ectopic lesions
  from 3 groups of EMs model mice. f The weights of ptgis−/− (n = 7) and ptgis−/+
  (n = 9) uterine debris-originated ectopic lesions were decreased compared to those
  of lesions in the WT group (n = 10). Statistical analysis was performed with Student’s
  t test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or the Mann–Whitney test. NS no significant
  difference, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. WT wild type, ptgis−/+ heterozygote, ptgis−/−
  homozygote.
