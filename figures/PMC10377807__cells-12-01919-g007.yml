caption: Protein levels and activation of different signaling pathway proteins, BRAF
  V600E, and activated CRAF, and p53 expression. The figure shows three parallel animals’
  tumor samples from the treatment-naïve group and from generation 5. GAPDH was used
  as an endogenous control to ensure equal protein levels of every sample. (A) Neither
  AKT, mTOR, MAP2K1/2 (MEK 1/2), or P44/42 (ERK 1/2) was found to be systematically
  activated, though the ERK 1/2 expression was found elevated in one of the three
  resistant tumors. Moreover, PDGFRB, which showed a 4-times elevation in RNAseq data,
  was shown not to be overexpressed on the protein level. (B) BRAF V600E and p-c-RAF
  expressions remained unchanged on the vemurafenib treatment. (C) p53 accumulation
  is similar in both the naïve and resistant (and treated) samples.
