caption: 'SPAG6 correlates with cancer cell stemness in LUSC. A: Correlation of SPAG6
  expression with cancer stemness. B: Effect of overexpression of SPAG6 on the cancer
  cell stemness marker Nanog by RT-qPCR. C: Effect of overexpression of SPAG6 on the
  cancer cell stemness marker ALDH1 by RT-qPCR. D: Effect of overexpression of SPAG6
  on the cancer cell stemness marker Sox2 by RT-qPCR. Data represent mean Â± SD from
  three independent experiments and were analyzed using two-way ANOVA (B-D) (*P <
  0.05). SPAG6, Sperm Associated Antigen 6; LUSC, Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma; ALDH1,
  Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1.'
