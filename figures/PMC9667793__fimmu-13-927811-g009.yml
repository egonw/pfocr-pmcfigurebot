caption: Prognostic and immune value of the riskScore gene signature. (A) Forest plot
  showing the riskScore was an independent prognostic biomarker using multivariate
  analyses. (B) The nomogram constructed to predict the probability of patient mortality.
  (C) The calibration plot of nomograms between predicted and observed 3-year and
  5-year outcomes. The 45-degree line represented the ideal prediction. (D) The correlation
  between riskScore signature and 24 TME cell infiltration. Blue, negative correlation;
  Red, positive correlation. (E) Differences in 24 TME infiltration cells between
  low and high risk groups. (F) The correlation between riskScore signature and immune
  checkpoint molecules. Blue, negative correlation; Red, positive correlation. (G)
  The GO enrichment revealed the immune response pathway significantly activated in
  cancer.
