caption: 'Inhibiting PLK3 attenuates TEC apoptosis via the ATM/P53 signaling pathway.
  (a) In the H/R injury model, the PLK3 protein levels and apoptosis-related protein
  levels were measured after targeted KD of PLK3 expression. (b) p-ATM protein levels,
  PLK3 protein levels, and apoptosis-related protein levels were measured by Western
  blot after the application of the specific ATM inhibitor KU-60019. The data are
  presented as the mean ± SD. n = 3. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗P
  < 0.0001. Nor: normoxia; Ku: KU-60019.'
