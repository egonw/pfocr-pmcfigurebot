caption: Connection of xenophagy core proteins to signaling pathways. Each circle
  node represents a core protein involved in xenophagy. Red boxes indicate the phase
  of autophagy core proteins are involved in. Rectangular nodes represent signaling
  pathways. The size of each pathway corresponds to the involved protein ratio, while
  edge width represents the number of regulatory connections from pathway members
  to the connected core protein.
