caption: Effect of JDNW on HMGB1/TLR-4/NF-κB pathway in ACLF rats. The protein expression
  levels in liver tissues of TLR-4, NF-κB P65, iNOS, and COX-2 were evaluated by western
  blotting. (a) Representative immunoblots. (b–e) The relative protein expression
  results of TLR-4, NF-κB P65, iNOS, and COX-2. Each bar represents the mean ± SD
  of n = 3 (∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, “ns” p > 0.05).
