caption: Three essential calcium signaling pathways and their roles on the calcium
  responses in chondrocytes. Extracellular Ca2+ can enter the cells through TRPV4
  and stretch-sensitive channels (SSC). Calcium influx can induce the release of ATP
  from vesicles. ATP can activate the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) on membrane,
  such as P2Y2 on chondrocytes, and further activate the PLC-IP3pathway. Activation
  of IP3 receptor (IP3R) can cause the release of Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER). Physical stimuli transferred deeply to ER can also induce Ca2+ release.
