caption: 'Schematic workflow for the functional correlation analysis of results from
  metabolic pathway analysis. Metabolomics data between two groups is compared by
  t-test analyses in two different datasets. Discriminant features or metabolites
  are identified, and metabolic pathway analysis performed. Results from pathway analysis
  are summarized with 2 k descriptors (the log10 (p-value), and the enrichment or
  impact factor) as coordinates of two data matrices X1 (m1 × k) and X2 (m2 × k) (m
  = pathways). As the number and identity of the pathways included in the results
  may vary across studies, for those pathways present in a single analysis, the p-values
  and the enrichment or impact factors are imputed as 1, and 0, respectively, in the
  other one (X1(m × k), X2(m × k). For each matrix × (m × k), a distance or dissimilarity
  matrix is computed (i.e., D1(m × m) and D2(m × m)) using a selected measure such
  as the Euclidean or the standardized Euclidean distance. Then, the lower triangular
  part of each dissimilarity matrix is unfolded into two vectors (d1 and d2) to calculate
  the pairwise linear correlation coefficient, (e.g., Pearson coefficient, or the
  rank-based Spearman correlation coefficient if non-linearity is expected) between
  them. The statistical significance of the calculated correlation coefficient between
  pathway analysis #1 and #2 is estimated using a permutation test and the correlation
  coefficient is computed for each permutation. Original figure from [].'
