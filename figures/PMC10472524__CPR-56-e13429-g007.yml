caption: 'Single‐cell analysis revealed heterogeneity of migrated astrocytes (ASCs)
  population from rat spinal cord slice under decellularised spinal cord matrix (DSCM)/COLI
  conditions. (A) UMAP visualization of ASC sub‐clusters which migrated into DSCM/COLI
  hydrogel. (B) The scaled gene expression of reference ASC markers in ASC sub‐populations.
  (C) Immunofluorescence analysis and quantification of the migrated cell (EGFR and
  GFAP). Scale Bar: 50 μm. ***p < 0.001 (t‐test, mean ± SEM). (D) The pseudotime rank
  of each ASC subgroup. (E) Representative significantly enriched GO terms in ASCs
  subtype based on top 50 marker genes. (F) The scaled gene expression of reference
  ASC mature and immature gene sets. Representative ligand–receptor interactions between
  neural progenitor cell (N1, N2, and N3) and ASC subtypes (A3, A8, and A9) were shown
  in (G).'
