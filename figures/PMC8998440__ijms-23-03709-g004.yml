caption: ELK3 controls extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling-related genes to control
  cell migration. (A) Gene set enrichment analysis of RNA sequencing data from SNU638
  cells transfected with siCon or siELK3. Cell adhesion-related genes were positively
  enriched and cell junction disassembly-related genes were negatively enriched in
  SNU638 cells transfected with siELK3. (B) Pie graphs showing biological pathways
  in ELK3-depleted SNU638 cells. Numbers indicate the number of genes in each biological
  pathway. (C) Heatmap analysis of genes associated with cell migration and cell adhesion.
  (D) Bar graph showing the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated
  Discovery (DAVID) annotation of genes involved in cell migration and cell adhesion.
  (E) Map data of Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes analysis (STRING).
  The thickness of the lines represents the confidence of the interaction.
