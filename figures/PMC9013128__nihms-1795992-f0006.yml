figure_title: ARID2 deficiency leads to altered gene expression programs linked to
  invasion
caption: (A) Association of ranked DEGs (heatmap) in SKmel147 ARID2 KO versus WT cells
  with their associated ATAC increased or decreased peaks (bottom), within a TAD and
  within ± 500 kb of the TSS. Replicates are shown (R1, R2). TEAD4/FOSL2 status is
  shown above and called if at least one of the gene-associated ATAC changing peaks
  is bound by FOSL2 and/or TEAD4.(B) Biological process gene ontology of genes in
  (A).(C) Heatmap of significantly upregulated genes (Z scores) from (B) of the pathway
  “response to TGFB.” TEAD4/FOSL2 status is shown on the left.(D) Heatmap of upregulated
  genes (Z scores) associated with regions with increased chromatin accessibility
  within a TAD overlapped with the “invasive melanoma signature” from .(E) UCSC genome
  browser (hg19) snapshot displaying a putative enhancer (highlighted in yellow) with
  increased accessibility and SS18/FOSL2 binding in ARID2 KO lines with the promoter
  of the associated upregulated gene TGFBR2 shown.(F) WCE immunoblots of SKmel147
  ARID2 WT (parental and NTC) and KO (KO1.4 and KO3.20) lines probed for TGFBR2, phospho-SMAD3,
  and SMAD3. GAPDH was used as a loading control (n = 2). See also  and , , , , and
