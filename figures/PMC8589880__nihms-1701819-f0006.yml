caption: '(A) An increased expression of MMP-13 in cells treated with IL-1β was noted,
  which was abrogated by SC-514 treatment (Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test).
  (B) Exogenous recombinant Postn instigated the expression of MMP-13, which was mitigated
  by SC-514 treatment. (Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons). (C)
  Pathway summary: DMM surgery or IL-1β treatment activates NF-κB signaling pathway
  in chondrocytes, as evidenced by increased p65 phosphorylation, leading to its nuclear
  translocation, and the expression of catabolic mediators (e.g., MMP-13) that promote
  extracellular matrix degradation. Administration of p5RHH Postn siRNA reduces the
  activation of p65, blocks the downstream catabolic effects of NF-κB signaling directly
  or indirectly, and prevents the progressive cartilage characteristic of post-traumatic
  OA. i.a.=intra-articular. Similar lowercase letters indicate statistically significant
  differences.'
