caption: Distribution of the differentially expressed circRNAs. (a) Analysis of circRNAs
  and their host genes shows most genes (81.49%) generating only one circRNA. (b)
  Chromosomal distribution of the differentially expressed circRNAs. (c) Chromosomal
  distribution of screened circRNAs in the human chromosomes. The farthest outer layer
  discloses the situation of the circRNAs. From the outside to the inside, the inner
  circles disclosed the expression distribution of all circRNAs in diabetic as well
  as normal samples.
