caption: The hypothesis between the Kiss1/GPR54 system in skeletal muscle and exercise
  capacity. (a) Kisspeptin regulates Ca2+ concentration in skeletal muscle to promote
  proliferation and differentiation via the PLC-MAPK/IP-3 pathway. (b) Kisspeptin
  inhibits ACC in skeletal muscle to promote mitochondrial activity by APMK and PGC1Î±.
