caption: 'SNAIL-dominated EMT and CXCL2-dominated macrophage infiltration are important
  features of lung metastases. (A) Colorectal carcinoma in situ and lung metastases
  heatmap of the 30 DEGs with |log2fold change | > 2, P < .05. Red: higher expression;
  blue: lower expression. (B) Colorectal carcinoma in situ and lung metastases module-trait
  associations. Each row corresponds to a module eigengene, and each column corresponds
  to a trait. Each cell contains the corresponding correlation and p value. The table
  is colour-coded by correlation according to the colour legend. (C) A scatter plot
  of gene significance (GS) and module members (MM) of relapses in the SteelBlue module.
  (D) Modular analysis of PPI networks in lung metastases. (E) Module analysis and
  statistical node number of the PPI network of lung metastatic tumours. (F) Pathways
  enriched by lung metastases, including the Intestinal Immune Network For IGA Production,
  Cytokine Receptor Interaction, Chemokine Signalling Pathway, and JAK STAT Signalling
  Pathway. (G) Heatmap of immune cell infiltration in lung metastases versus primary
  tumours. (H) Violin diagram of immune cell infiltration in lung metastases versus
  primary tumours.'
