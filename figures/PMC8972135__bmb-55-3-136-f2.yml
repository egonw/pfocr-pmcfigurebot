caption: Effect of PN-101 on survival of LPS challenged mice. (A) Mice were injected
  intraperitoneally with 7.5 mg/kg of LPS immediately followed by intravenous injection
  of 10μg of PN-101 (i.e., co-treatment group, n = 10). The same number of PN-101
  was injected intravenously at 30 min after LPS injection (i.e., post-treatment,
  n = 10). (B) Ten μg of mitochondria isolated from human platelets were used for
  treatment immediately after LPS injection (i.e., co-treatment group, n = 5) or 30
  min after LPS injection (i.e., post-treatment group, n = 26). Survival was assessed
  every 6 h for 3 days. ***P < 0.001 compared with No-treatment.
