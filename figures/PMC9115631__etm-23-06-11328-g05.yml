caption: 'Effects of BDMC on the activation of MAPK and NF-κB pathway. (A and B) The
  expression levels of MAPK pathway related proteins p-p38, p38, p-JNK, JNK, p-ERK
  and ERK by western blot analysis. (C and D) The expression levels of NF-κB pathway
  related proteins p-NF-κBp65, NF-κBp65, IκBα and p-IκBα. The density of each band
  was quantified by ImageJ Software. The data are presented as the mean ± standard
  deviation. Data are representative of 3 independent experiments. ###P<0.001 vs.
  Control group; ***P<0.001 vs. OVA group. BDMC, bisdemethoxycurcumin; p-, phosphorylated;
  OVA, ovalbumin.'
article_title: Bisdemethoxycurcumin attenuates OVA-induced food allergy by inhibiting
  the MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways.
