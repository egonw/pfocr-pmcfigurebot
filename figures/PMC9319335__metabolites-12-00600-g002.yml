caption: Functional annotation of differential metabolites identified in the SBS cohort.
  (A,B) Volcano plots showing differential metabolites in patients with SBS compared
  to non-SBS controls in positive mode (A) and negative mode (B). Green represents
  the down-regulated differential metabolites, red represents the up-regulated differential
  metabolites, and metabolites without statistic difference are labeled gray. (C,D)
  Classification of differential metabolites identified in positive mode (C) and negative
  mode (D). The X axis represents the number of metabolites in each class, and the
  Y axis represents the metabolite classification entries. Others means that classification
  information is the remaining categories. (E,F) Metabolic pathway enrichment analysis
  of differential metabolites based on the KEGG database in positive mode (E) and
  negative mode (F). RichFactor is the number of differential metabolites annotated
  to the pathway divided by all identified metabolites annotated to the pathway. The
  dot size represents the number of differential metabolites annotated to this pathway.
  Metabolic pathways with p-value < 0.05 were significant. VIP, variable importance
  in the projection.
