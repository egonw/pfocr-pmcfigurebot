caption: 'GO enrichment analysis of DEGs in G vs. R tips. A list of genes that were
  differentially expressed between growing tips and retracting tips (1488 genes) were
  analyzed by DAVID enrichment analysis (v. 6.8): (A) GO terms for genes were expressed
  more highly in G tips than R tips (FC > 1.5, FDR < 0.1). The horizontal axis represents
  the −log10(FDR) of the significant GO terms. The x-intercept of the vertical red
  line indicates the standard cutoff value, where −log10FDR = 1.301 (FDR = 0.05).
  Numbers beside the bars indicate the list hit numbers vs. list total numbers. Red
  terms are genes directly involved in protein synthesis; Green terms are for mitochondrial
  function; Blue terms are for the modification of DNA or chromosomes; the Pink term
  is for the ubiquitin conjugation pathway; and the Black terms are for other cell
  functions. (B) Scatter plot for genes expressed more highly in G tips than R tips
  (p < 0.05, FC > 1.5). Color dots represent categories of GO terms similar to those
  in (A).'
