figure_title: Serotonergic activity modulates cortical and spinal motoneurone activity
caption: A, serotonin synthesis in the mammalian CNS occurs in the raphe complex of
  the brainstem. Rostral raphe nuclei ascend primarily to the forebrain to innervate
  virtually all regions. Caudal raphe nuclei project mainly to the cerebellum and
  spinal cord, where the monosynaptic raphe–spinal pathway releases 5‐HT on the soma
  and dendrites of spinal motoneurones. Ionotropic inputs from descending motor cortical
  pathways, peripheral afferents, or spinal interneurons, have the capacity to depolarise
  and hyperpolarise the motoneurone. However, activation of 5‐HT receptors, predominantly
  in the 5‐HT1 and 5‐HT2 families, regulates the state of excitability of the motoneurone
  via intracellular signalling pathways to modify the motoneurone's responsiveness
  to ionotropic input. B, intracellular recordings from motoneurones in an adult turtle
  spinal cord preparation (black). The number of action potentials evoked by depolarizing
  current pulses injected in the soma is increased following 1 s of 40 Hz electrical
  stimulation of the dorsolateral funiculus (red), which contains descending serotonergic
  fibres of the raphe–spinal pathway. C, lengthening the duration to 3 min of 40 Hz
  electrical stimulation inhibited motoneurone firing compared to the control, which
  is attributed to 5‐HT spillover onto extracellular 5‐HT1A receptors on the axon
  initial segment. D, 3 min of 40 Hz stimulation in the presence of the 5‐HT1A antagonist
  WAY‐100635 (20 μM) removed the inhibitory influence of 5‐HT. Data sourced from Cotel
  et al. ().
