caption: Protective role of OLNZ in H2O2-mediated apoptosis and on Bax and Bcl proteins
  in SH-SY5Y cells. The expression (%) of (A) Bax protein decreased and (B) Bcl-2
  increased after pretreatment of SH-SY5Y cells with OLNZ in comparison with H2O2-mediated
  neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. All data are presented as the mean Â± SEM, and the
  experiment was repeated three times. (#) compared to the control and (*) compared
  to H2O2, p < 0.05.
