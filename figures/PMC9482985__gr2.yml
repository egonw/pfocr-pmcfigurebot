caption: The complex and multi-level regulatory mechanisms for the control of plant
  seed oil accumulation.(A) LEC1, LEC2, FUS3, and ABI3 are the major upstream transcriptional
  regulators that mediate embryo development, seed maturation, and metabolism. Together
  with HSI2/VAL1, AGL15, BBM, TT8, MYB89, they form a network that tightly controls
  the expression of WRI1. These upstream regulators also mutually regulate one another.
  The upstream regulators are affected by epigenetic factors, including CLF and PKL.
  WRI1 physically interacts with several transcription factors, such as BPMs, 14-3-3s,
  MED15, and TCP4, as well as post-translational modifiers, such as KIN10 kinase.
  WRI1 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation (circled
  P) and ubiquitination (Ub), that result in protein degradation. The targets of WRI1
  include genes involved in the FA biosynthetic pathway and late glycolysis. The positive
  (arrows) and negative (T-bars) regulatory mechanisms, together with post-translational
  modifications, form a network that fine-tunes oil biosynthesis.(B) Other transcriptional
  regulators that participate in the regulation of plant oil biosynthesis by upregulating
  oil pathway genes. MYB96, DOF4, DOF11, TZF, WRKY10, WRKY43, DREB2C, and bZIP67 positively
  regulate FA accumulation in seeds. Other factors, including TT2, TTG1, GL2, MYB76,
  MYB118, and WRKY6, negatively affect seed oil accumulation. The crosstalk among
  the positive and negative regulatory modules enables balanced and fine-tuned responses
  to environmental and developmental signals during seed oil accumulation. The green
  arrows indicate positive regulation. The red T-bars represent negative regulation.
  Black lines indicate the formation of protein–protein interacting complexes. Genes
  in light blue shaded circles are downstream targets of the transcription factors.
