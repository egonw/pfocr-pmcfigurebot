caption: Acetylation of MOB1 regulates Hippo signaling pathway. (A and B) FLAG-MOB1
  plasmids (WT or K11R mutant) were expressed respectively in H1299 KO cells (A) or
  HEK293T cells (B). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with M2-beads (anti-FLAG)
  and followed by immunoblotting with the p-MOB1 (T12) Ab and FLAG Ab. (C–F) H1299
  KO cells (C,E) or HEK293T cells (D,F) were transfected with FLAG-MOB1 (WT or K11R
  mutant), and the lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with p-YAP (S127) Ab (C,D),
  p-TAZ (S89) Ab (E,F), p-LATS1 (T1079) Ab, FLAG Ab and Actin Ab (C–F). (G and H)
  H1299 (G) or HEK293T cells (H) transfected with FLAG-MOB1 (WT or K11R mutant) were
  coimmunoprecipitated with M2-Beads (anti-FLAG) and then immunoblotted with the indicated
  antibodies. (I and J) H1299 KO cells (I) or HEK293T cells (J) were transfected with
  FLAG-MOB1 (WT or K11R mutant), and then nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins were extracted.
  Nuclear proteins and cytoplasmic proteins were subjected to western blot analysis
  respectively with YAP, TAZ, FLAG, GAPDH (reference gene for cytoplasm) and YY1 (reference
  gene for nucleus) antibodies. S.E. means short exposure. L.E. means long exposure. (K)
  FLAG-MOB1-WT or K11R mutant was expressed respectively in H1299 KO cells, and endogenous
  ANKRD1, CTGF and CYR61 mRNA expression levels were detected by qPCR. Statistical
  analyses were performed by GraphPad Prism 6, and error bars represent means ± SD.
  According to two-tailed Student’s t-test, * is for P< 0.05 and ** is for P< 0.01.
  Images and statistical results were based on three independent experiments.
