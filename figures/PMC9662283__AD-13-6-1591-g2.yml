caption: Roles of gut-brain axis in DM and PD. Gut microbiota dysbiosis causes beneficial
  bacterial metabolites to decrease and proinflammatory cytokine levels to increase,
  leading to systemic inflammation and pancreatic β-cell apoptosis. Proinflammatory
  cytokines then propagate from the gut-brain axis, resulting in microglial activation
  and NLRP3 pathway activation and further causing neuroinflammation.
