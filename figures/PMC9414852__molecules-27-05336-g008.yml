caption: Anti-pulmonary fibrotic mechanism of MOBT. MOBT inhibited lncITPF transcription
  by preventing p-Smad2/3 translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, resulting
  in the reduction of the lncITPF–hnRNP L complex. The decreased lncITPF–hnRNP L complex
  reduced MEF2c expression by blocking its alternative splicing, which in turn inhibited
  the expression of MEF2c target genes, such as TAGLN2 and FMN1.
