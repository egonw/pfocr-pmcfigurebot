caption: KEGG analyses of DEPs at different time points after co‐culture. (A) At 6 h
  after co‐culture, ribosome, endocytosis, viral myocarditis and folate biosynthesis
  pathways were significantly enriched. (B) At 12 h after co‐culture, neurodegenerative
  disorders including Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease
  were enriched. Oxidative phosphorylation and Wnt signalling pathway were also enriched.
  (C) B. At 24 h after co‐culture, neurodegenerative diseases pathways, oxidative
  phosphorylation and chemokine signalling pathway were enriched
