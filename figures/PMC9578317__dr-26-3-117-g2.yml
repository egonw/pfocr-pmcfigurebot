figure_title: Co-transfection of TSC-22 and BRD7 inhibits tumor cell growth
caption: Ovarian cancer cells were seeded on 24-well culture plates and attached for
  24 h. (A) SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cancer cells were transiently transfected with expression
  vectors encoding TSC-22 and/or BRD7 and the number of survival cells was counted
  at 1 day intervals for 3 days. (B) SKOV3 cells were transiently transfected with
  50 ng pcDNA-BRD7 and various concentrations of pcDNA-TSC-22 (0, 20, 50, 100 ng)
  or 50 ng pcDNA-TSC-22 and various concentrations of pcDNA-BRD7 (0, 20, 50, 100 ng)
  and incubated for 48 h and the number of survival cells was counted. Results are
  means±SD from three samples each. * p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001 compared with
  control. BRD7, bromodomain-containing protein 7; TSC-22, transforming stimulated
  clone 22.

  Protein 7 (BRD7) to Enhance the Inhibition of Extracellular Signal-Regulate Kinase
  (ERK) Pathway in Ovarian Cancer.
