caption: 'Orthogonal experimental design of iTRDL devices matching upstream pathway
  nodes for the fine-tuning synthesis of DML from methanol. (A) Biosynthetic pathway
  of DML used for evaluation of the iTRDL. It involves four enzymes: LovB, LovC, LovG
  and NpgA (). We expressed these genes as an upstream module for the full MJ pathway.
  (B) Design scheme for fine-tuning production of DML by iTRDL devices. The LacI–Mxr1AD-derived
  devices from iTRDL were used. The corresponding hybrid promoters of lacOnHAmcA (various
  numbers of lacO and HA linked with cPAOX1) were used for differential expression
  of biosynthetic genes, respectively. (C) DML biosynthesis by separate control of
  pathway nodes with iTRDL devices. Devices were selected from the library subset
  described in (B). We employed the orthogonal experimental design method with four
  factors (genes) and three levels (output strengths of devices) to evaluate the fine-tuning
  functions of the iTRDL. The three expression levels were set as ∼100% (1.0-fold),
  ∼250% (2.5-fold) and ∼450% (4.5-fold) relative to PAOX1 to adapt to the four pathway
  genes separately (). Thus, devices Nos I62, I66 and I72 in Figure  were used. Nine
  recombinant single-copy strains, Pp/iTRDL-BCGN (A1–A9), were obtained with correct
  genotypes. K-value analysis from the experimental data predicted an optimal expression
  combination of LovB (4.5-fold), LovC (2.5-fold), LovG (1.0-fold) and NpgA (2.5-fold).
  It then led to a strain with this optimal combination (designated as Opt). In contrast,
  two previously constructed high-yield strains, i.e. D1 (single-copy strain) and
  D9 (optimum multicopy strain), were used as control groups, in which each biosynthetic
  gene was driven by the PAOX1 (,). These strains were grown in glucose medium (YPD)
  and then shifted to methanol medium (YNMB) to the final density at an OD600 of 1.0
  for incubation. N.D., not detected. (D) Cell growth of various DML-producing strains
  from (C). Error bars represent the standard deviation of three biological replicates
  assayed in duplicate or triplicate. Statistical significance of the DML titre and
  cell growth of Opt relative to other strains is shown at different time points (*P<0.05
  at 72, 96 and 120 h, respectively).'
