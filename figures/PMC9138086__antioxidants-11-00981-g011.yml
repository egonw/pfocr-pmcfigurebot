caption: Schematic representation of inhibition of the inflammation-related signal
  transduction pathway by Ficus awkeotsang Makino extract (FAE). ROS, reactive oxygen
  species; IκB, inhibitor of κB; and NFκB, nuclear factor kappa B. The ROS are produced
  after UVB irradiation, while the IκB kinase activates the NFκB pathway. Activation
  of the NFκB triggers expression of several inflammatory genes, including members
  of the iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase), COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2), and IL-6
  (interleukin-6). iNOS and COX-2 regulate the inflammatory response. IL-6 is a multifunctional
  cytokine that regulates the immune response.
