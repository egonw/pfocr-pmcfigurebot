caption: 'CHI3L1 expression is associated with NF-κB pathway activation in glioma.
  (A-B) Volcano plot and heatmap of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in GSE100675
  dataset. (C-D) GO and GSEA based on DEGs identified in GSE100675. (E) Heatmap of
  genes targeting the NF-κB pathway in normal and tumors. (F-G) Volcano plot and heatmap
  of DEGs in TCGA glioma cohort. (H) Heatmap of 50 hallmark gene sets performed by
  GSVA in TCGA. (I-J) Enrichment score of TNFɑ NF-κB pathway among normal and tumor,
  as well as among CHI3L1high and CHI3L1low groups in TCGA, Wilcoxon test. (K) Spearman
  correlation analysis between the mRNA expression of CHI3L1 and NF-κB pathway enrichment
  score in TCGA. tstudent (163) = 13.48, rPearson = 0.73, CI95% [0.64, 0.79], npairs

  and TNFɑ NF-κB pathway enrichment score between the five subclasses of glioma in
  TCGA, Kruskal-wallis test. (N) Heatmap of 50 hallmark gene sets by GSVA in CGGA
  mRNA-array 301 dataset. (O) Density plot showed the TNFɑ NF-κB pathway enrichment
  score between CHI3L1high and CHI3L1low groups in CGGA, Wilcoxon test. (P) Spearman
  correlation analysis between CHI3L1 expression and NF-κB pathway enrichment score
  in CGGA. tstudent (299) = 16.69, rPearson = 0.69, CI95% [0.63, 0.75], npairs = 301.
  loge (BF01) = -95.06, = 0.69,  = [0.63, 0.75],  = 1.41. (Q-R) Violin plot showed
  the expression of CHI3L1 and TNFɑ NF-κB pathway enrichment score between the four
  subclasses of glioma in CGGA, Kruskal-wallis test. (Q) Fwelch (3, 90.33) = 101.56,
