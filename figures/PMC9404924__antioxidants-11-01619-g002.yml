caption: A new possibility of H2S in anti-aging via mitohormesis. Mitohormesis refers
  to as an adaptive response through which the induction of mild or moderate mitochondrial
  stress can promote the viability and health of a cell, tissue, or organism. Depending
  on the severity of the perceived stress, there are varying hormetic responses existing
  in the mitochondria called mitochondrial stress response to adapt to different stress
  levels. The mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) is activated as the
  first line of defense for mitigating the stress, which induces a retrograde signaling
  pathway from the mitochondria to the nucleus, leading to the expression of proteases,
  chaperonins, and many stress response genes to degrade the unfolded or misfolded
  proteins and re-establish the mitochondrial protein homeostasis. In addition, mitochondria
  are highly dynamic organelles that undergo coordinated cycles of fission and fusion,
  referred to as mitochondrial dynamics, to maintain their size, shape, and distribution.
  When the stress level is increased, mitochondrial dynamics comes into action. When
  the mitochondrial stress level is overwhelmed, a selective type of autophagy targeting
  the damaged mitochondria for degradation, termed mitophagy, takes place. H2S can
  be an important regulator for these mitochondrial stress responses, both directly
  and indirectly, as this gas itself may be a pro-oxidant by stimulating the Fenton
  reaction or it may undergo the sulfide oxidation pathway in the mitochondria to
  generate highly reactive sulfur species (RSS), which can be further oxidized or
  can modify cysteine residues via persulfidation.
