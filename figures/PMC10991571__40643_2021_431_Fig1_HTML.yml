caption: Metabolic pathway of α-farnesene synthesis from lipid substrate in Y. lipolytica.
  Lipid was activated to FA-CoA, which converts to acetyl-CoA through β-oxidation.
  Acetyl-CoA was transported to cytoplasm and α-farnesene synthesized via the MVA
  pathway. Here, Erg20 and FS were used by a linker with GGGS amino acid sequence.
