figure_title: Transcriptome profiling of human lung cancer cells expressing sgRNAs
  against mito-respiratory hits reveals overexpression of glycolytic pathway genes
  in vitro and repression in vivo
caption: RNA-Seq was performed on HCC827 cells expressing individual sgRNA against
  top hits c14orf2, MALSU1, TMEM261 (or control sgRNA) (n = 4 samples per cell line)
  to determine changes in gene expression in vitro and in vivo. (A) Averaged expression
  for each mito-respiratory sgRNA was compared to control cells, fold-change, indicated
  by log2(FC) plotted on the x-axis, and log2(p-value) on the y-axis. SgRNA-targeted
  genes are indicated by green triangles, with each cell line demonstrating the expected
  reduced expression of its targeted gene (upper left quadrant). Glycolytic genes
  were the most overexpressed genes overall, with ENO2, PGK1, and HK2 being the most
  overexpressed genes across all 3 cell lines. (B) Gene set enrichment analysis identifies
  glycolysis and mitochondria-associated pathways and ontologies as enriched in all
  3 cell lines. Significance was set at p < 0.05. (C) Volcano plots shown for each
  of the single sgRNA cell lines. Expected sgRNA-mediated silencing was observed in
  all 3 cell lines (blue dot). (D) HCC827 cells transduced with either control sgRNA
  or MALSU1 sgRNA were injected into the flanks of nude mice, then grown for 28 days,
  after which tumors were removed and analyzed by RNA-Seq. Pathway analysis was performed
  comparing the MALSU1 sgRNA cells to control sgRNA cells grown in vivo (blue) or
  in vitro (red), and displayed in a bubble plot indicating normalized enrichment
  score (NES) and log10p-value for significantly altered pathways. Control sgRNA tumors
  n = 4, sgMALSU1 tumors n = 2. Underlying data can be found in .
