caption: Enrichment of eIF4/p70S6K and unfolded protein response pathways in the KO
  cells. Canonical pathway analysis revealed the (A), regulation of eIF4 and p70S6K
  signaling pathway and (B), the UPR pathway among the topmost canonical pathways
  enriched upon mdig knockout. Nodes represent molecules in a pathway, whereas the
  biological relationship between nodes is represented by a line (edge). Edges are
  supported by at least one reference in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. The intensity
  of color in a node indicates the degree of up (red) or down (green) regulation.
