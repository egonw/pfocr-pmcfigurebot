caption: Elevated effects of CLEFMA on caspase-3 activation and HO-1 expression in
  human OSCC cells. (A) HSC-3 cells were incubated for 24 h with 8 μM CLEFMA and compared
  with untreated lysate (DMSO control group), and the cell lysates were used to detect
  35 different apoptosis-related proteases using the human proteome profiler apoptosis
  array. (B) The quantification of cleaved caspase-3, HO-1, and cIAP-1 from human
  apoptosis array. (C) Live cell imaging apoptosis dye for caspase-3 activity used
  to detect apoptotic death using fluorescence microscopy with the corresponding filter
  (green channel). Western blot was performed on HO-1 and cIAP-1 using β-actin as
  the internal control in (D) HSC-3 and (E) SCC-9 cells. Quantitative data were acquired
  from three independent experiments and expressed as mean ± SD. * represent p < 0.05
  as compared with the DMSO vehicle.
