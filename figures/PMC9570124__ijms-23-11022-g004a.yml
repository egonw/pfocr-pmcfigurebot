caption: 'IFI27 protein knockdown reverses ADAMTS16-induced GC cell promotion. (A)
  Western blot and quantitation analysis of IFI27 in stably ADAMTS16-transfected HGC27
  and AGS cells and stably knockdown ADAMTS16–transfected MKN1 and SGC7901 cells.
  (B–E) Transwell assays were performed to assess cell migration and invasion in the
  indicated cell lines (original magnification: 200×). (F,G) colony formation assays
  were performed to assess cell colony formation and proliferation ability in the
  indicated cell lines. Scale bar, 50 µm. The data are shown as means ± standard deviations.
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001. ns, not significant.'
