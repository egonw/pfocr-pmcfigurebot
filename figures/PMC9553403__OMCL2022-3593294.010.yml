caption: 'Diagrammatic presentation of the findings from this study. MSCs-Exo upregulates
  the expression level of SIRT1. SIRT1 restoration leads to an increase in Nrf2 and
  HO-1. Collectively, this mechanism inhibits ferroptosis induced by surgery so as
  to alleviate cognitive impairment. MSCs: mesenchymal stem cells; MSCs-Exo: mesenchymal
  stem cell-derived exosomes; dNCR: delayed neurocognitive recovery; SIRT1: silent
  information regulator 1; Nrf2: factor nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor
  2; HO-1: heme oxygenase-1.'

  Recovery in Aged Mice by Inhibiting Hippocampus Ferroptosis via Activating SIRT1/Nrf2/HO-1
  Signaling Pathway.
