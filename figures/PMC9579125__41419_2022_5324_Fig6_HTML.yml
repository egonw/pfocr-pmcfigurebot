caption: a WB analysis with anti-PERK, p-eIF2α, eIF2α, GADD34, ATF4 and actin on hippocampal
  homogenates of WT and 3xTg-AD (3xTg) mice. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM of six
  independent experiments; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01 by unpaired t-test. b, c Co-localization
  of p-eIF2α and GADD34 with GFAP and analysis on WT and 3xTg hippocampi. b IF on
  40 µm thick brain slices with anti-GFAP (red), p-eIF2α (green) and DAPI (blue).
  Arrows indicate p-eIF2α-expressing GFAP-positive astrocytes. c IF on 40 µm brain
  slices with anti-GFAP (red) and GADD34 (green) and DAPI (blue). Images were acquire
  using Leica SP8 LIGHTNING Confocal Microscope imaging systems, scale bar = 25 µm.
  d qPCR of Atf4, Xbp1s and Herpud1 on the hippocampi of WT and 3xTg mice. Data are
  expressed as mean ± SEM of 5–6 independent experiments, unpaired t-test analysis.
