caption: 'SUN5 interacted with Nup93 to promote phosphorylated ERK1/2 nuclear translocation.
  (A) The expression of pERK1/2 was assessed in SUN5-OE and NC cells by Western blotting.
  GAPDH and LaminB1 were used as controls for cytoplasmic and nucleus fractional purity,
  respectively (* p < 0.05). (B) The expression and subcellular localization of pERK
  (green) were determined by immunofluorescence staining. DAPI was used for nuclear
  staining (blue). Scale bar: 50 μm (left); 5 μm (right). (C) The interaction between
  SUN5 and Nup93 was validated in SUN5-OE cells by Co-IP analysis.'
