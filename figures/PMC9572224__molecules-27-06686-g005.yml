caption: '(A) Real-Time PCR (qPCR) results expressed relative changes of c-Myc, p53,
  and ERK over the control, using GAPDH as an endogenous housekeeping gene in DBTRG-05MG.
  (B) Representative Western blot analysis of p53 and c-Myc from DBTRG-05MG total
  cell lysate. The level of these protein expressions was normalized to α-tubulin.
  Band intensities were quantified using Image J software. Relative intensities of
  (C) c-Myc and (D) p53 are presented in the bar graph. Data expressed as mean ± SEM
  and statistical analysis between three independent groups was performed by t-test
  compared with the control group: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.005, *** p < 0.0005.'
