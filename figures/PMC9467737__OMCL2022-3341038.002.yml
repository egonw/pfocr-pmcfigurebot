caption: Deletion of Siglec-15 inhibits the polarization of macrophages towards M2.
  (a–c) Bone marrow cells from wild-type and Siglec-15 knockout mice were extracted
  in vitro and induced into bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). 100 ng/mL LPS
  and 20 ng/mL IFN-γ to stimulate for 12 hours; induce them into M1-type macrophages
  and detect the inflammatory factors expressed by M1-type macrophages by qPCR. (d–f)
  20 ng/mL IL-4 to stimulate BMDMs cells for 24 h or 48 h to induce into M2-type macrophages.
  qPCR detects the marker genes expressed by M2-type macrophages. (g–i) Tumor supernatant
  conditioned medium to stimulate BMDM cells for 24 h or 48 h to induce into M2-type
  macrophages, and qPCR to detect the marker genes expressed by M2-type macrophages.
  The experiments were repeated three times, and each experiment was triplicated.
