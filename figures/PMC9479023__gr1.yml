caption: 'HG conditions increased the expressions of NOX2 and NOX4 and enhanced ROS
  production in podocytes. (A) Western blot analysis of NOX2 and NOX4 expression in
  podocytes after treatment with HG at different time points. (B–C) Quantification
  analysis of NOX2 and NOX4. ∗P < 0.05 vs. NG group, #P < 0.05 vs. mannitol group,
  △P < 0.05 vs. 6 h group, and &P < 0.05 vs. 12 h group. (D) Podocytes were treated
  with HG for 24 h, and intracellular ROS production was measured with DCFH-DA staining.
  (E) Quantitative analysis of the relative fluorescence intensity of DCFH-DA. ∗P
  < 0.05 vs. NG group, #P < 0.05 vs. HG group. The uncropped images of (A) were referred
  to in supplementary Figure 1.'
