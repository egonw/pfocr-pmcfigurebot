caption: STAT3 signaling pathway does not control cDC2 ability to prime Tfh cells
  after antigen targeting to the DCIR2 receptor. STAT3Flox/Flox and STAT3 cKO mice
  were immunized with 5μg of αDCIR2-MSP119PADRE together with 50 μg of Poly (I:C)
  as adjuvant or only Poly (I:C) as a control. Splenocytes were obtained 5 days later
  and Tfh cells, GC B cells and plasma cells were analyzed by flow cytometry, and
  anti-MSP119 IgG titers were determined by ELISA. (A) Frequency of Tfh cells in CD4+
  T cells. (B) Absolute numbers of Tfh cells in the spleen. Bcl-6 and IL-21 were stained
  after fixation/permeabilization and their expression on Tfh cells was detected by
  flow cytometry. (C) MFI for Bcl-6 was determined in Tfh (CD3+CD4+CXCR5HighPD-1High)
  and non-Tfh cells (CD3+CD4+CXCR5-PD-1-). (D) MFI for IL-21 was determined in Tfh
  and non-Tfh. Histograms in blue show non-Tfh and in red Tfh cells. (E) Frequency
  and (F) absolute numbers/spleen of germinal centers (GL7+CD95+CD3-B220+). (G) Sera
  were titrated to detect specific anti-MSP119 IgG antibodies by ELISA. Bars show
  mean ± SD from two experiments pooled together (n=6-7 animals/group) in (A, B, E,
  F) and from one experiment (n=3 animals/group in (C, D, G). *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ****p<0.0001,
  and ns not significant; one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post-test.
