caption: Candidalysin is secreted into an invasion pocket formed by C. albicans hyphae.
  Candidalysin intercalates into the host cell membrane and stimulates the release
  of EGFR ligands, which induces ERK1/2 activation downstream of EGFR, resulting in
  c-Fos activation and the release of the neutrophil-activating chemokines GM-CSF
  and G-CSF. Through a parallel pathway, candidalysin also activates p38, resulting
  in IL-6 release and Hsp27 phosphorylation. p38 activation is not triggered by EGFR
  but by two selective and independent pathways that differentially control p38 signaling
  outputs. MKK3/6 promote IL-6 release, whereas Src triggers p38-induced EGFR phosphorylation
  independent of ligand binding. Both Src and MKK3/6 promote p38-dependent Hap27 phosphorylation.
