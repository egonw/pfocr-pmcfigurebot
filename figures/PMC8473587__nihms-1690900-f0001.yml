figure_title: p53 regulates glucose, lipid, amino acid, nucleotide, and iron metabolism
caption: p53 participates in the regulation of metabolism of diverse biomolecules
  (including glucose, lipid, amino acid, nucleotide, and iron) in a transcription
  factor (TF)-dependent or â€“independent way. Major target genes regulated by p53 in
  these metabolic pathways are shown in this figure. For the full names of them, please
  refer to . Those proteins that are modulated positively by p53 (directly or indirectly),
  like promoting their expressions or activities, are depicted in blue. Oppositely,
  those proteins that are modulated negatively by p53 (directly or indirectly), like
  suppressing their expressions or activities, are depicted in red. If some protein
  can either be promoted or suppressed by p53 in different circumstances, it is depicted
  in green. Black arrows indicate positive effects. Black perpendicular bars indicate
  negative effects. G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; F6P,
  fructose-6-phosphate; F2,6BP, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate; PFK1, phosphofructokinase
  1; F1,6BP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate; 3PG, 3-phosphoglycerate; SSP, serine synthesis
  pathway; 2PG, 2-phosphoglycerate; Fpn, ferroportin; Ser, serine; Glu, glutamate;
  Gln, glutamine; Cys, cysteine; Gly, glycine; Pro, proline; Asp, asparate; Asn, asparagine;
  Arg, arginine; GSH, glutathione; TCA cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle; OXPHOS, oxidative
  phosphorylation; MVA pathway, mevalonate pathway.
