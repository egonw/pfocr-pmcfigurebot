caption: Illustration of activated TLR4 signaling by recognition of pathogen- and
  damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs) present in the extracellular
  milieu and organization of TJ proteins at the apical surface of epithelial cells.
  While the expression and activity of TLR4 are increased, the disruption of TJ proteins
  and actin cytoskeleton leads to compromised barrier function during lung injury.
  An activated TLR4 forms a transmembrane complex upon binding to its ligand and is
  internalized in the cell. Hypothetically, the TLR4 complex may associate with TJs
  (A) or downstream TLR4-signaling and effector molecules (B) and affect the TJ assembly
  and compromise the epithelial barrier function. The circadian rhythm and yet unknown
  mechanisms could potentially regulate TLR4-signaling, TJ assembly, and barrier function.
  Intracellular co-receptors of TLR4-signaling pathway (MYD88, myeloid differentiation
  primary response 88, TIRAP, toll-interleukin 1 receptor [TIR] domain containing
  adaptor protein, TRAM, TRIF-related adaptor molecule, TRIF, TIR-domain-containing
  adaptor protein inducing interferon-Î²) are identified within the figure.
