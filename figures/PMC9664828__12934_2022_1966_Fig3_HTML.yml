caption: Metabolic profiling of amino acid pools and central carbon metabolism in
  2 overexpression strains and reference strain B36 at steady state. a and b The relative
  pool size of amino acids and intracellular metabolites in OE-fadE (overexpressing
  gene fadE), OE-fadA (overexpressing gene fadE) and B36. The average content of each
  metabolite (Cmean) in the three strains was set as the reference and the relative
  content was calculated as (C-Cmean)/Cmean. c Fatty acids degradation (β-oxidation),
  amino acid synthesis and center carbon metabolism pathway
article_title: Enhancement of fatty acid degradation pathway promoted glucoamylase
  synthesis in Aspergillus niger.
