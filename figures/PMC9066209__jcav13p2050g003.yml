caption: 'CuI suppressed the migration and invasion of PDAC. (A) BXPC-3 cell migration
  under different concentrations of CuI treatment, scale bar: 200 µm. (B) Image J
  software was used to measure the distance of PDAC migration. (C) Transwell assays
  used to assess cell 3D-migration of BXPC-3, scale bar: 200 µm. (D) The area of migrating
  cells was counted by Image J software. (E) Transwell assays with matrix gel used
  to assess cell migration of BXPC-3, scale bar: 200 µm. (F) The area of invasion
  cells was counted by Image J software.'
