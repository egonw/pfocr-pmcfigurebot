caption: Protective effect of adiponectin on the vascular endothelium. Adiponectin
  promotes endothelial cell survival, differentiation, and migration, and the transition
  of macrophages from the inflammatory M1 phenotype toward the anti-inflammatory M2
  phenotype, and inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration
  and foam cell transformation. Adiponectin increases NO production through the PI3K-dependent
  pathway and AMPK pathway. Moreover, adiponectin directly inhibits atherogenic molecules
  to regulate atherosclerosis.
