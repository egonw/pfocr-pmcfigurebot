caption: 'Effect of CNP extract on SIRT1 protein expression in HT22 cells. Cells were
  incubated with (a) CNP extract (10–50 μg/mL) or (b) resveratrol (0.5–5 μM) for 24
  h. The levels of protein expression were determined by Western blot analysis. The
  protein expressions are shown as relative to the SIRT1 level and normalized by β-actin.
  The data are represented as the means ± SD (n = 3). Note: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01
  versus non-treated control.'
