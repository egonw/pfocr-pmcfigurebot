caption: 'MgIG decreases intestinal permeability and inhibits LPS/TLRs/NF-κB pathway
  activation induced by HRZE. (a) Serum concentration of FD4 (n = 5 per group); (b)
  serum concentration of LPS (n = 6 per group); (c) TNF-α, (d) IL-1β, (e) IL-6, (f)
  TLR2, (g) TLR4, and (h) NF-κB mRNA levels of liver tissue in each group (n = 6 per
  group). The data are presented as the means ± SEM (n = 6 per group). Compared with
  the control group: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001.
  Compared with the HRZE group: #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, and ####p < 0.0001.'
