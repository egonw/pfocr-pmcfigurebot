caption: 'LINC01140 blocked the malignancy behavior of BC cells by targeting miR-452-5p.
  MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 cells were transfected with an empty vector, mimic-NC, LINC01140-OE
  (OE), mimic, or OE+mimic. (a) Cell viability in these above transfected BC cells
  was uncovered utilizing CCK-8 assay. (b) Bax and Bcl-2 protein levels in these above
  transfected BC cells were uncovered utilizing western blotting analysis. (c) Migrated
  cells were counted utilizing transwell in these above transfected BC cells. ∗∗P
  < 0.001 vs empty vector; ^^P.<0.001 vs mimic-NC; #P < 0.01, ##P < 0.001 vs OE+mimic.'
