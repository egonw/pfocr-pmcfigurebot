caption: 'MG53 and hUC-MSCs attenuate glia cells activation and oxidative stress in
  AD mice by targeting Nrf2 signaling pathway. (A) Representative immunofluorescence
  images of GFAP, Iba-1, and ROS staining. Scale bar = 100 μm. (B) Quantification
  analysis of GFAP+ cells, (C) Iba-1+ cells, and (D) ROS fluoresces. (E) MDA level.
  (F) SOD viability. (G) Immunoblots of key protein expressions of the Nrf2 signaling
  pathway and densitometric analysis (H–I). Data were presented as mean ± SEM. N = 3
  per group. *: Compared with the AD group, P < 0.05; #: Compared with the MSCs group,
  P < 0.05.'
