caption: Key signaling pathways in platelets linked to (reversible) integrin activation
  αIIbβ3 and platelet aggregation. For explanations, see text. In short, the IP receptor
  for prostacyclin inhibits platelets via adenylyl cyclase (AC), while gaseous nitric
  oxide inhibits platelets via guanylate cyclase (GC); the formed cAMP and cGMP activate
  protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase G (PKG), respectively. As platelet adhesion
  receptors, integrin and GPIb-V-IX interact with fibrinogen, fibrin and von Willebrand
  factor (VWF). The purinoceptors P2Y12 and P2Y1 operate after autocrine release of
  ADP; P2Y12 acts via the G protein Giα, inhibiting AC but stimulating phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3K). On the other hand, P2Y1 signals via Gqα which stimulates phospholipase
  C (PLC), causing Ca2+ release and activation of protein kinase C (PKC). As a strong
  platelet agonist, thrombin also activates Gqα-coupled receptors, namely PAR1 and
  PAR4. The collagen receptor GPVI activates a protein tyrosine kinase pathway involving
  Syk and Btk, leading to downstream activation of PLC and PI3K isoforms, the latter
  stimulating Akt protein kinase. The signaling toward activation of αIIbβ3 furthermore
  involves the small GTPase-regulating proteins CalDAG-GEFI (calcium and diacylglycerol
  regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor I), Ras3a and Rap1b. The cytoskeleton-linked
  signaling is completed by kindlin and talin isoforms. Black arrows show relative
  strength of pathways to integrin activation; red arrows connected to blue-boxed
  proteins represent inhibitory pathways.
