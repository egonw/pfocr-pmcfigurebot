figure_title: CFTR-dependent [Cl−]i is associated with platelet aggregation during
  CAD
caption: The study subjects were grouped into normal coronary artery (NCA) and coronary
  artery disease (CAD) after coronary angiography. Washed platelets were collected
  from CAD patients and NCA controls. a [Cl−]i was analyzed using the chloride indicator
  MQAE probe. (NCA, n = 18 vs CAD, n = 32; unpaired t test). b [Cl−]e was analyzed
  using the ion-selective electrode method. (NCA, n = 47 vs CAD, n = 39; unpaired
  t test). c qRT-PCR analysis of CFTR mRNA expression. (NCA, n = 32 vs CAD, n = 32;
  unpaired t test). d Western blot analysis of CFTR protein expression. (NCA, n = 54
  vs CAD, n = 55; unpaired t test). e, f, Aggregation of washed platelets in response
  to 10 μM ADP or 0.02 U/mL Thrombin. (NCA, n = 10 vs CAD, n = 8; unpaired t test).
  g-h, The correlation between the aggregation ratio and CFTR protein expression in
  platelets from NCA and CAD groups (In total, 18 samples from experiment e, f). r
  and P values by Partial correlation analysis are presented. Data are shown as mean ± SEM;
  ****P < 0.0001. ns not significant
