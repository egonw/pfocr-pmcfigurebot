caption: Modulation of AMPK-mTOR pathway by S. gallinarum infection to chicken hepatocytes
  and reversing effect of cinnamaldehyde; an evidence from transcriptome analysis.
  S. gallinarum infection results in activation of the AMPK-mTOR pathway, eventually
  causing less glucose, fatty acid, protein, and lipid biosynthesis. At the same time,
  cinnamaldehyde treatment inhibits these metabolic changes and results in the modulation
  of the genes involved in more glucose, fatty acid, protein, and lipid biosynthesis.
  It is important to note that genes of AMPK-mTOR, which were upregulated in the treatment
  group, were actually downregulated in the challenge group and vice versa.
