caption: Cell model illustrating β2-adrenergic and insulin-mediated regulatory pathways
  for K+ uptake in skeletal muscle. β2-Adrenergic stimulation and insulin both lead
  to K+ uptake by stimulating the activity of the Na+-K+-ATPase pump primarily in
  skeletal muscle, but they do so through different signaling pathways. β2-Adrenergic
  stimulation leads to increased pump activity through a cAMP- and protein kinase
  A–dependent pathway. Insulin binding to its receptor leads to phosphorylation of
  the insulin receptor substrate protein (IRS-1), which in turns binds to phosphatidylinositide
  3-kinase (PI3-K). The IRS/1-PI3-K interaction leads to activation of 3-phosphoinositide
  dependent protein kinase-1. The stimulatory effect of insulin on glucose uptake
  and K+ uptake diverge at this point. A serine/threonine protein kinase–dependent
  pathway is responsible for membrane insertion of the glucose transporter protein
  GLUT4, whereas activation of atypical protein kinase C leads to membrane insertion
  of the Na+-K+-ATPase pump. Not shown is that insulin stimulates pump activity by
  increasing cell Na+ brought about by a stimulatory effect on the Na+-H+ antiporter.
