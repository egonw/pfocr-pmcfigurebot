caption: ICA impairs the promoting effect of exogenous miR-205-5p on tumor growth.
  (A) Tumor volume in each group. (B) Tumor quality in each group. (C) IHC detected
  the expression of Ki-67 in the tumor tissues of each group. (D) The expression of
  miR-205-5p and PTEN mRNA levels in each group were detected by RT-qPCR. Data are
  shown as the mean Â± SD of experiments (n=3), *P<0.05. ICA, icariin; miR, microRNA;
  IHC, Immunohistochemistry; PTEN, Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome
  ten; RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR; NC, negative control.
article_title: Icariin inhibits the malignant progression of lung cancer by affecting
  the PI3K/Akt pathway through the miR-205-5p/PTEN axis.
