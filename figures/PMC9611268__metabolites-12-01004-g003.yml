caption: 'Effect of myositis on skeletal muscle tissue in the mouse model. (A) histology
  of control and CIM. (B) The histologic score of control and CIM. (** p < 0.0001)
  (C) PCA plot of control and CIM skeletal muscle tissue. (D) Volcano plot from t-test
  results of control and CIM. Red dots are upregulated metabolites, and blue dots
  are downregulated metabolites. (E) Network analysis of mouse tissue, comparing CIM
  and control. Border color and node color: red indicates up-regulation in CIM, and
  blue indicates down-regulation in CIM. Node size indicates the FDR-adjusted p-value.'
