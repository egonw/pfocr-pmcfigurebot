caption: Effects of CHDT on the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in mice with Dex-induced
  muscle atrophy. The protein expression levels of components of the Akt/mTOR signaling
  pathway were measured by Western blotting in (A) QUA and (B) GAS muscles. GAPDH
  was used as the loading control and the phosphorylation of the intermediates was
  normalized to the total expression levels of each protein. Different letters indicate
  statistically significant differences; p < 0.05, a > b > c > d.
