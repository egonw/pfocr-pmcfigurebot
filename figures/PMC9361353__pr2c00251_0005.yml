caption: '(a) Heatmap of lectin microarray data for postvaccination (day 28) serum
  samples. Columns represent the participants and rows represent the probes. Shown
  is the normalized log2 ratios (Sample signal (S)/Reference signal (R)). Total response
  scores are annotated with a green-white sliding scale bar on the top of the heatmap.
  Rough specificities of select lectins are annotated on the right of the heatmap.
  (b,c) Boxplots of log2 fold-change for paired d28 and d0 samples in non- and high
  responders. (b) High-mannose binding lectins (Griffithisin and BanLecH84T). (c)
  Sialyl Lewis X binding probes (Anti-sLex). Paired Mann–Whitney U test was used to
  determine p-values. n.s.: not statistically significant (no difference is observed
  d28/d0); (*) p < 0.05. Glycans are shown in SNFG notation at the side of the boxplots.
  Symbols are defined as follows: galactose (yellow ●), N-acetylglucosamine (blue
  ■), mannose (green ●), sialic acid (purple ◆), fucose (red ▲).'
