caption: 'SIN inhibits angiogenesis in vitro by promoting apoptosis and inhibiting
  HUVEC migration, proliferation and tube formation. (A) Inhibitory effects of different
  doses of SIN on the proliferation of HUVECs. The data are presented as percentages
  of respective control values for cell viability. n=8, *P<0.05, **P<0.01, VEGF +
  SIN group vs. the VEGF + vehicle group; ##P<0.01, SIN group vs. the vehicle group.
  (B) Effects of SIN on induction of HUVEC apoptosis. The cells were treated with
  or without VEGF and SIN. The levels of apoptosis were assessed using flow cytometry
  analysis. n=3, **P<0.01. (C) The effects of SIN on the migration of HUVECs were
  assessed using the wound-healing assay (magnification, x100). n=3, *P<0.05. (D)
  SIN inhibits HUVEC migration as demonstrated by Transwell assays (magnification,
  x100). n=3, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001. (E) The angiogenic activity of HUVECs was inhibited
  by SIN as determined by the tube formation assays (magnification, x40). n=8, **P<0.01,
  ***P<0.001. SIN, sinensetin; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; VEGF,
  vascular endothelial growth factor.'
