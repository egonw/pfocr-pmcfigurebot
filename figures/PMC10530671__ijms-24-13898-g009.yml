caption: 'The probable mechanism of aberrant CI in papaya fruit at 1 °C and 6 °C.
  The red words and arrows in the figure represented enzymes that were up- and down-regulated
  when stored at 1 °C. The 6 °C-stored fruit showed the opposite result. Expression
  profiles of genes associated with the EMP-TCA pathway in papaya fruit during cold
  storage. The rows in each heat map represent the indicated genes, and the five columns
  indicate the 1 °C and 6 °C storage times (left to right): 0 d, 12 d, 24 d, 36 d,
  48 d. The colors represent the differences in gene expression value between different
  samples in the heat map. Each value represents the mean for three replicates.'
