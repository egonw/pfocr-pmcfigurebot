caption: GSEA on reduced markers of 27K SMOTE using (a) TCGA EAanalysis where orange
  represents biological processes, cyan is a cellular component, green is molecular
  function, and yellow represents pathways, (b) ShinyGO with network visualization
  of functional associations where maroon color represents a molecular function, green
  represents network-based interaction of biological processes, while the graph in
  red and blue color represents the strength of the molecular functions identified
  and (c) ShinyGO enriched pathway visualization where red genes are in the gene set
  [,].
