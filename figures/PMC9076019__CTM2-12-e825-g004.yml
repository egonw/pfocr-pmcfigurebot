caption: HSP90 N‐terminal inhibitors induce lysosomal degradation of MORC2 through
  the CMA pathway. (A) MCF‐7 and T47D cells were treated with DMSO or 1 μM of 17‐AAG,
  AUY922, STA‐9090 alone or in combination with 100 nM Baf A1 for 24 h. Total cellular
  lysates were harvested for immunoblotting analysis with the indicated antibodies.
  (B) MCF‐7 and T47D cells were treated with DMSO or 1 μM of 17‐AAG, AUY922, STA‐9090
  alone or in combination with 10 μM MG‐132 for 24 h. Total cellular lysates were
  harvested for immunoblotting analysis with the indicated antibodies. (C,D) MCF‐7
  and T47D cells were transfected with control siRNA (siNC) or two independent siRNAs
  targeting HSPA8 (siHSPA8) or LAMP2A (siLAMP2A). After 24 h of transfection, cells
  were treated with DMSO or 1 μM of 17‐AAG, AUY922 or STA‐9090 for 24 h. Total cellular
  lysates were harvested for immunoblotting analysis. (E) MCF‐7 and T47D cells were
  transfected with Flag‐MORC2. After 24 h of transfection, cells were treated with
  DMSO or 1 μM of 17‐AAG, AUY922 or STA‐9090 for 24 h, and then subjected to immunofluorescent
  staining with the anti‐Flag (red), anti‐HSPA8 (green) and anti‐LAMP2A (green) antibodies.
  DNA was counterstained with DAPI. Scale bar, 10 μm. The dark blue arrows in the
  merged images indicate the co‐localization of MORC2 with HSPA8 or LAMP2A in the
  cytoplasm (yellow colour)
