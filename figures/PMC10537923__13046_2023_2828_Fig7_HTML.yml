caption: 'KIAA1429-related m6A network might be induced by NKX2-2. A Venn diagram
  showing the 9 overlapping highly expressed and KIAA1429-correlated transcripts in
  ES. B Ranks of 9 ES-specific transcripts based on the FC in expression. C Transcriptional
  NKX2-2 profile of ES cells among all cancer cell lines in the DepMap database. D
  Gene track showing high binding signals for NKX2-2 at the KIAA1429 promoter region
  (upper panel) and the METTL3 promoter region (lower panel) using public ES ChIP-seq
  datasets. H3K27ac and H3K4me3 as the markers of promoter. E RNA-seq showing decrease
  in a set of m6A writers after NKX2-2 knockdown. F Matrix showing the gene–gene correlation
  value among KIAA1429, METTL3, WTAP and YTHDF3 expression in different ES tumor datasets.
  H Summary diagram describing the KIAA1429 pathway and potential critical phenotypes
  in ES cells. ChIP: chromatin immunoprecipitation; ChIP-seq: ChIP sequencing; ES:
  Ewing sarcoma; FC: fold change; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and *** P < 0.001'
