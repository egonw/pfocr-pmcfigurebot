caption: Ursolic acid reduces the level of oxidative stress in kidney tissue after
  unilateral ureteral obstruction in rats. (a) 8-oxo-dG immunohistochemical staining
  of oxidative stress damage marker in kidney tissue; (b) the statistical graphs of
  8-oxo-dG immunohistochemical absorbance (A) values in rat kidney tissues of different
  groups; (c) the measurement of MDA content in kidney tissue by the thiobarbituric
  acid method (mean ± standard deviation, n = 6); (d) the SOD content in kidney tissue
  measured by the pyrogallol method (mean ± standard deviation, n = 6); ∗means P <
  0.05; ∗∗means P < 0.01; ∗∗∗means P < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗means P < 0.0001.
