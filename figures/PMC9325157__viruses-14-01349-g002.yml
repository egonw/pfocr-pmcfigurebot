caption: The replication cycle of SARS-CoV-2 and viral-host interplay. (A) SARS-CoV-2
  enters the cell via ACE2. Viral RNA gets translated by host ribosomes and replicated
  within the double-membrane vesicles. The virions are assembled at ERGIC and then
  egressed outside the cell. (B) Host cell detect viral proteins and nucleic acids
  through PRRs and induce interferon pathway signaling. (C) Activated interferon response
  through JAK/STAT pathway inhibits viral cycle unless blocked by viral proteins.
  Yellow squares represent host proteins participating in antiviral response; orange
  dots illustrate phosphorylation events. Red circles stand for coronaviral structural
  proteins; green for orfs; and blue for nsps.
