caption: Downregulation of fibulin‐4 inhibits the growth of ESCC xenograft tumors
  in mice. (a) Nude mice were executed after 20 days since being subcutaneously inoculated.
  (b) The results are expressed as tumor volume (mean ± SD). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.
article_title: Downregulation of fibulin‐4 inhibits autophagy and promotes the sensitivity
  of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells to apatinib by activating the Akt‐mTOR
  signaling pathway.
