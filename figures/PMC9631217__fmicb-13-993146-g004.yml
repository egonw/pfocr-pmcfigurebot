caption: (A) PLS-DA to distinguish the overall metabolic differences between the Sham,
  HIBD and HIBD + SB group (n = 6 per group). (B) Cluster heat map of differential
  metabolites (n = 6 per group, p < 0.05). (C) Volcano plots of all differential metabolites
  between three groups (all p < 0.05). (D) Metabolic pathway enrichment analysis of
  differential metabolites was performed based on KEGG database between HIBD + SB
  and HIBD groups, where p = 0.01 indicated by the red line and p = 0.05 indicated
  by the blue line. (E) KEGG pathway of butanoate metabolism.
