figure_title: ARHGEF2 regulate SOX2 via FGFR1/MAPK pathway in PCa
caption: A Heatmap showing genes up-regulated (red) or down-regulated (blue) in 22RV1
  ARHGEF2 downregulated cells obtained by RNA-seq analysis. B, C KEGG pathway enrichment
  (B) and GSEA (C) analysis showing the MAPK pathway enriched in the 22RV1-siARHGEF2
  group relative to control. D, E Immunoblot analysis for protein levels in SOX2 and
  FGFR1/MAPK pathway in ARHGEF2-silenced (shARHGEF2) and control (shSCR) LNCaP-AI
  (left) and 22RV1 (right) cells. F Immunoblot analysis for protein levels in SOX2
  and FGFR1/MAPK pathway in ARHGEF2-overexpressed (oeARHGEF2) and control (oeVector)
  LNCaP cells. G Immunoblot analysis for protein levels in SOX2 and FGFR1/MAPK pathway
  using the same cells as F treated with AZD4547. AZD4547, a selective FGFR inhibitor
  []. H, I Immunoblot analysis for protein levels in ARHGEF2 using the LNCaP-AI and
  22RV1 cells treated with Vehicle and AZD4547. J Illustration showing AR-repressed
  ARHGEF2 regulate SOX2 via FGFR1/MAPK pathway in prostate cancer. AR, androgen receptor;
  ARHGEF2, Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 2; FGFR1, fibroblast growth factor
  receptor 1; SOX2 SRY-Box transcription factor 2; NE neuroendocrine.
