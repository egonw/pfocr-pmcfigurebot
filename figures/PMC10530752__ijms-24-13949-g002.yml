caption: Effects of piperine on induction of apoptosis in HSC-3 cells. (A,B) Fluorescence
  microscopic images of HSC-3 cells treated with piperine (100 and 150 µM for 24 h)
  and stained with DAPI. The arrows indicate DAPI-positive HSC-3 cell. (C,D) FACS
  results of HSC-3 cells treated with piperine (100 and 150 µM for 24 h) and were
  double stained with annexin-V/PI. (E,F) Expression levels of PARP, Bax and Bcl-2
  in HSC-3 cells after piperine (100 and 150 µM for 24 h) treatment. β-actin was used
  as loading control, and the quantification was performed using ImageJ. Data are
  presented as mean and SD for three samples. * p < 0.05, compared with the control
  group.
