caption: 'LIPUS promoted immunoregulation and osteogenic differentiation of hPDLSCs
  by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway. A: protein levels of IκBα, p-IκBα, p65,
  and p-p65 examined using western blotting; B entry of p65 into nuclei detected using
  immunofluorescence; C proteins level of immunoregulatory factors (TGF-β, IDO, and
  IL-10) in hPDLSCs and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1α) in PBMCs was
  detected using ELISA; D mRNA levels of immunoregulatory factors (TGF-β, IDO, and
  IL-10) in hPDLSCs and inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-lα) in PBMCs in
  co-culture system were measured using RT-qPCR; E mRNA levels of osteogenic differentiation-related
  genes (Runx2, OPN, OSX, and OCN) in hPDLSCs in co-culture system were detected using
  RT-qPCR; F protein levels of osteogenic differentiation-related genes (Runx2, OPN,
  OSX, and OCN) in hPDLSCs in co-culture system were detected using WB. G number of
  mineralized nodules in hPDLSCs in co-culture system counted using alizarin red staining;
  H ALP activity of hPDLSCs in co-culture system was measured using ALP staining.
  Cellular experiments were repeated three times. Data are presented as mean ± standard
  deviation and were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey''s multiple comparison
