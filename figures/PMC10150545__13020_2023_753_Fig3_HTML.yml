caption: 'BGXJW administrations downregulate the mRNA and protein levels of key enzymes
  in the lipid synthesis pathway increased by alcohol. C57BL/6 mice were treated as
  indicated in material and methods. The mRNA and protein were collected and tested
  respectively. A–E The mRNA levels of SREBP1c, SREBP2, FASN, SCD1, ACC1 in liver
  tissues were subjected to RT-qPCR analysis. F SREBP1c, FAS, SCD1 in liver lysates
  with indicated treatment were determined by western blot. All data are expressed
  as the mean ± SEM (n = 3). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 vs ctrl group; nsP > 0.05, #P < 0.05,
