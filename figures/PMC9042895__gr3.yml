caption: 'The phosphorylation level of p38 is increased in the neurosphere derived
  from the hiPSC (414C2) overexpressing GADD45G(A) Quantification of the expression
  level of phosphorylated p38 when GADD45G is overexpressed in the 414C2-derived neurospheres
  with a lentiviral vector (n = 3, 0.00850).(B) Immunostaining images of phosphorylated
  p38 in the neurosphere derived from the hiPSC (414C2) overexpressing GADD45G. Venus
  is used as a reporter in the control lentiviral vector and EGFP is used as a reporter
  in the GADD45G overexpressing lentiviral vector.(C) Quantification of the expression
  level of total p38 when GADD45G is overexpressed in the hiPSC (414C2)-derived neurospheres
  with a lentiviral vector (n = 3, 0.500).(D) Immunostaining images of total p38 in
  the neurosphere derived from the hiPSC (414C2) overexpressing GADD45G. Venus is
  used as a reporter in the control lentiviral vector and EGFP is used as a reporter
  in the GADD45G overexpressing lentiviral vector.Statistical analyses were performed
  with unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-tests. The values in the bar graphs represent
  the means ± SEs. 10 neurospheres were observed for each experiment. ∗∗∗p < 0.001.
  Scale bars: 100 μm.'
