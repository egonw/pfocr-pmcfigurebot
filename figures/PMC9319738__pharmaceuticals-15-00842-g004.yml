caption: 'Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and pathway analysis of differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) among differentiated neuronal cells affected by neurotoxicity
  induced by TDP-43 and ethacrynic acid. (a) The top 10 significantly enriched GO
  terms according to a hypergeometric test p-value adjusted with the Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg
  (BH) procedure. Green bars: GO terms in molecular function category; orange bars:
  GO terms in biological process category; blue bars: GO terms in cellular component
  category. (b) The top 10 significant pathways according to p-value adjusted with
  the BH procedure. (c) The illustration of the nuclear erythroid 2-related-factor
  (Nrf2)-mediated oxidative stress response pathway is generated using the Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis software. Red objects represent genes that were upregulated in
  the neurotoxic condition induced by TDP-43 and ethacrynic acid.'
