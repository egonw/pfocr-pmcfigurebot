caption: PPRV induces the NF-κB signaling pathway. (A to D) PPRV replication was observed
  in THP-1 cells. PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells were infected with PPRV (MOI = 2.0)
  for 0, 24, 48, and 72 h. The cytopathic effect (A), mRNA level (B), virus titer
  (C), and protein level (D) of PPRV were detected. Bar, 200 μm. (E and F) BAY11 inhibited
  IL-1β secretion induced by PPRV. PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells were infected with
  PPRV ChinaGS2018 (E) or PPRV Nigeria 75/1 (F) (MOI = 2.0) for 48 h or stimulated
  with LPS (1 μg/mL) for 3 h. The production of IL-1β was determined by ELISA. (G
  and H) PPRV induced the NF-κB signaling pathway. PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells
  were infected with PPRV (MOI = 2.0) for 12, 24, and 36 h. LPS (1 μg/mL) stimulation
  for 6 h acted as a positive control. The protein levels were determined by immunoblotting
  analysis. Data represent at least three independent experiments and are means and
  SD (n = 3). ***, P < 0.001; ns, not significant.
