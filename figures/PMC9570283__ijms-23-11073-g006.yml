caption: Proposed model for the role of IL-1 and TGFβ in corneal stromal cell differentiation
  during wound healing. A high concentration of IL-1 is released from injured corneal
  epithelial cells and immune cells and stimulates transition of keratocytes into
  corneal fibroblast, as well as proliferation and migration during the early phase
  of stromal injury. IL-1-induced NF-κB signaling serves as the dominant signaling
  pathway. Myofibroblast differentiation is prevented due to the inhibitory effect
  of NF-κB signaling on TGFβ-induced signaling. However, TGFβ from epithelial cells,
  tears, and possibly stromal cells, accumulates over time during wound healing. Thus,
  the balance eventually shifts to TGFβ dominant signaling, which leads to cell-cycle
  arrest and myofibroblast differentiation. The wound healing stage enters the wound
  closure phase with the maturation of contractile myofibroblast.
