caption: Transient dynamics of stress-induced metabolic responsesTemporal response
  of model ensemble  to a step of  H2O2 representing the mean value (blue line), a
  subsample of 50 trajectories (gray line) and the SD (gray shadow).(A) Dynamic response
  of all metabolite species until 5 min.(Bâ€“D) Temporal response of H2O2, G6P, and
  GAPD activity until 100 s, highlighting multiphasic and rapid adaptation responses.
