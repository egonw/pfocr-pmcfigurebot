figure_title: Inhibitory effect of DSF on the B cell response was related to the pyrimidine
  metabolism pathway
caption: 'KEGG pathway (down-regulated genes) enrichment analysis of RNA-seq data
  of B cells 3 h after stimulation by IL4+anti-CD40 antibody (IL4CD40) (a) or LPS
  (b), pathways downregulated in DSF-pre-treated B cells compared with those in B
  cells without DSF. c Hierarchical clustering and heat map of mRNA transcript abundance
  in B cells unstimulated (NC) or stimulated with IL-4 plus anti-CD40 antibody or
  LPS with DSF (IL4CD40DSF and LPSDSF) or without inhibitor (IL4CD40 and LPS). Gene
  expression FPKM values obtained from RNA-seq analysis related to salvage pathway
  (d) and de novo pathway (e) and in pyrimidine synthesis (n = 4 biologically independent
  samples). Significance was calculated using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc
  analysis: *P  <  0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. Data are shown
  as the mean ± SEM.'
