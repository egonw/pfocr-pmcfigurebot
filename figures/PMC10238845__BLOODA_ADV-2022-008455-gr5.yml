caption: Opposing effects of tumor-expressed and liver-derived FVII on prometastatic
  genes and metastasis. (A) qPCR analysis of Slug and Sox9 expression in MDApcDNA
  and MDAFVII after vehicle or rFVIIa (n = 4). (B) Western blot analysis of Sox9 expression
  in MDApcDNA and MDAFVII after vehicle or rFVIIa. The analysis of prometastatic gene
  expression was analyzed using qPCR in MDA-MB-453 (n = 5) (C) and MDA-MB-468 (n =
  5) (D). (E) Effects of rFVIIa on Wnt pathway activity as determined with a β-catenin–responsive
  luciferase construct in the presence or absence of the Wnt pathway activator LiCl
  (n = 3). (F) Effects of rFVIIa on Wnt pathway activity in the presence of Wnt3A
  (n = 3). Effects of mFVIIa on Sox9 in MDApcDNA and MDAFVII was analyzed using qPCR
  (G) and western blot (H). (I) Schematic overview in time of tumor cell grafting
  and subsequent downregulation of liver mFVII by siRNA approaches. (J) In vivo orthotopic
  tumor growth of MDApcDNA and MDAFVII after control (siNEG) or FVII (siF7) siRNA
  treatment (n = 6). Black asterisks show significant differences between tumor growth
  after MDAFVII graftment in the presence of siNEG vs that after graftment of MDApcDNA
  cells in the presence of siNEG. Red asterisks show differences in tumor growth after
  graftment of MDApcDNA cells in the presence of siNEG vs that after graftment of
  MDApcDNA cells in the presence of siF7. (K) MDApcDNA and MDAFVII liver metastasis
  after control (siNEG) or FVII (siF7) siRNA treatment as determined using qPCR and
  histochemistry (L). Statistically significant differences were tested using t tests.
