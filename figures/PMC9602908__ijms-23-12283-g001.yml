caption: 'Weight gain and pathological changes of prostates in rats. Effect of exposure
  to bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol AF (BPAF) and the inhibitor of nuclear transcription
  factor-κB (NF-κB), pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC), for 4 weeks on body weight
  (A); ventral prostate weight (B); and organ coefficient of ventral prostates (C),
  n = 10. (D) The pathological changes of the tissues (200×, scale bar = 100 μm) and
  the prostate epithelium are pointed to with arrows. (E) The height of prostate epithelium
  of ventral prostates, n = 6. (F) The immunohistochemical images of proliferating
  cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (400×, scale bar = 20 μm). Arrows indicate the positive
  expression. (G) Immunohistochemistry (IHC) quantification of PCNA was presented
  as the ratio of the positively expressed nucleus to the total nucleus, n = 8. Results
  were performed as means ± SD, analyzed using ANOVA followed by LSD post hoc test.
  Comparison of the individual administration group and the control: * p < 0.05, **
  p < 0.01; comparison of the combined administration group and the individual administration
  group: # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01. Organ coefficient = 1000× ventral prostate weight/terminal
  body weight.'
