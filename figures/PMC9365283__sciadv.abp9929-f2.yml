figure_title: Sum of mass-domain spectrum obtained from PiMS of human kidney
caption: (A) Full-scale PiMS spectrum in 5 to 72 kDa summed from 16,500 MS scans;
  regions occupied by abundant blood proteins (hemoglobin subunits and albumin) are
  labeled in the spectrum; red asterisks denote the key glycolytic enzymes found in
  the spectrum. (B) PiMS full spectrum in the 18- to 56-kDa range zoomed in from (A);
  major proteins identified using a variety of approaches are labeled in the spectrum;
  aside from glycolytic enzymes (red asterisks), enzymes involved in a few other major
  metabolic pathways (Krebs cycle, gluconeogenesis, and oxidative phosphorylation)
  found in PiMS are labeled in the spectrum. (C) Theoretical (red triangles) and experimentally
  observed (black trace) isotopic distributions of the four glycolytic enzymes [labeled
  with red asterisks in (A) and (B)] together with their PiMS images depicted in a
  schematic diagram of the glycolysis metabolic pathway. The cortex and the medulla
  of the kidney section imaged are labeled in the autofluorescence image at the top.
  Scale bars, 1 mm. Selected mass range of 22.2 to 22.7 kDa (D) and 41.4 to 42.1 kDa
  (E) showing identified proteoforms (spectrum in black, theoretical isotopic distributions
  in color). (F) GO analysis of biological pathways found enriched in the 169 identified
  proteoforms from the PiMS experiment shown in the âˆ’log10(P) scale.
