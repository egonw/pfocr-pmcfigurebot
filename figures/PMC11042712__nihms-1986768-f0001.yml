caption: Production and downstream effects of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
  in airway smooth muscle. Factors such as Ca2+ and signaling intermediates (relevant
  to asthma) stimulate production of pre-pro-BDNF that is cleaved into pro-BDNF that
  is packaged into vesicles and secreted. Pro-BDNF can also be intracellularly cleaved
  via convertases (e.g., furin) into mature BDNF that is also packaged into vesicles,
  and thus both pro- and mature BDNF are released into the extracellular space. Extracellular
  pro-BDNF can be cleaved to mature BDNF via proteases such as tissue plasminogen
  activator or matrix metalloproteinases. BDNF acts on plasma membrane high-affinity
  full-length tropomyosin-related kinase TrkB-FL receptors or low-affinity p75NTR
  receptors. In ASM, TrkB-FL is of functional importance. Downstream, TrkB increases
  [Ca2+]i via the PLC/IP3pathway and increases ASM proliferation and extracellular
  matrix (ECM) production via different signaling intermediates also relevant to inflammation.
  Thus, ASM-derived BDNF can interact with inflammatory signaling in the context of
  asthma
