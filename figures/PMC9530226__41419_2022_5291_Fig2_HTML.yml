figure_title: Combination of transcriptome and metabolome reveals the interruption
  of choline metabolism by DHRS2
caption: A Scatter plots of all expressed genes in OVCAR3-CON and OVCAR3-DHRS2 cells.
  Blue color indicates upregulated genes, red indicates downregulated genes, and gray
  indicates non-regulated genes. The ‘regulated gene’ is defined as a gene with FDR ≤ 0.001
  and abs (log2(Y/X)) ≥ 1. B Heatmap of the transcriptome changes in OVCAR3-CON and
  OVCAR3-DHRS2 cells (n = 3 for each group). C Enriched KEGG pathway analysis in the
  transcriptome of OVCAR3-CON and OVCAR3-DHRS2 cells. D Pathway enrichment analysis
  in the metabolome of OVCAR3-CON and OVCAR3-DHRS2 cells. E Important features identified
  by partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). The colored boxes on the
  right indicate the relative concentrations of the corresponding metabolite in OVCAR3-CON
  and OVCAR3-DHRS2 cells.
