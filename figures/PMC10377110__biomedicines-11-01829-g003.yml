caption: 'Gene expression of primary hLESCs upon Wnt/β-catenin activation. hLESCs
  were treated with 5 nM LY2090314 for nine days and compared to untreated control
  cells. Real-time qRT-PCR revealed the difference in expression of genes for (A)
  differentiation (CX43, KRT3, and KRT12), pathway control gene AXIN2, and genes for
  (B) stemness and quiescence (TP63 and CEBPD), progenitor (SOX9), and proliferation
  (MKI67, PCNA) of treated hLESCs in comparison to control hLESCs. The data from five
  donors (n = 5) are presented as mean ± SEM, *: p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01, ns: not significant.'
