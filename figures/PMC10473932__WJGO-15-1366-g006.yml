caption: 'Comparison of the invasion and migration ability of gastric cancer cells
  after down-regulation of LINC01268. A: The invasive ability of MGC80-3 in the sh-LINC01268
  group was significantly weaker than that in the sh-negative control (sh-NC) group;
  B: The migration ability of MGC80-3 in the sh-LINC01268 group was significantly
  weaker than that in the sh-NC group; C: The invasive ability of AGS in the sh-LINC01268
  group was significantly weaker than that in the sh-NC group; D: The migration ability
  of AGS in the sh-LINC01268 group was significantly weaker than that in the sh-NC
  group; E: After knocking down the expression of LINC01268 in MGC80-3, the cell migration
  ability was significantly weakened; F: After knocking down the expression of LINC01268
  in AGS, the cell migration ability was significantly weakened. All the experiments
  were performed in triplicate. The results were shown as the mean Â± SD. aP < 0.05,
  bP < 0.01, cP < 0.001. sh-NC: sh-negative control.'
