caption: 'Distribution and function of DEGs related to Zn2+ stress. (A): Venn diagram
  and Volcano plot of DEGs; (B): GSEA analysis of Zn2 treatment; (C,D): Scatter plot
  of GO enrichment of up- and downregulated genes. (E,F): Scatter plot of enriched
  KEGG pathways of upregulated and downregulated genes. The Rich factor is the ratio
  of the number of genes that were differentially expressed to the total number of
  genes in a certain pathway. The figure shows the top 20 enriched pathways.'
