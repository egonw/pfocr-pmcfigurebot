caption: Bubble diagram of KEGG pathway enrichment of differentially expressed genes.
  The Y−axis shows the name of the pathway and the X−axis represents the Rich factor.
  The larger the Rich factor, the greater the degree of enrichment. (A) M1 vs. M2−up,
  (B) CK1 vs. CK2−up, (C) M2 vs. M3−up, (D) CK2 vs. CK3−up, (E) M1 vs. M2−down, (F)
  CK1 vs. CK2−down, (G) M2 vs. M3−down, and (H) CK2 vs. CK3−down.
