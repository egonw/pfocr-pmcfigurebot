caption: Heatmap of DEGs involved in the DEGs involved in the PI3K/AKT pathway genes
  in the comparison of CTRL vs. 5 µM (left column of each comparison) or CTRL vs.
  10 µM (right column of each comparison). The green scale is related to downregulated
  genes, whereas the red palette represents upregulated ones. Gray is used when the
  difference is not statistically relevant in the comparison.
