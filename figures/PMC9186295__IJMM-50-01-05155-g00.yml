caption: 'Melanoma ALDH1A1 promoted HUVECs recruitment and modulated endothelial Notch
  signaling in a model of 3D multicellular melanoma tumorspheres. Loss-of function
  and gain-of function validation was used to study ALDH1A1 expression in melanoma
  cells. Western blot analysis of (A) A375 and (B) WM-266-4 (ALDH1A1SC and ALDH1A1KD,
  clones shA and shB) cultured in 10% FBS for 48 h. Enzymatic activity in (C) A375
  and (D) WM-266-4 evaluated by NADH production. ***P<0.001 vs. ALDH1A1SC; ###P<0.001
  vs. ALDH1A1KD; °P<0.05 and °°P<0.01 vs. ALDH1A1+. Western blot analysis of (E) A375
  and (F) WM-266-4 cultured in 10% FBS for 48 h. β-actin was used as loading control.
  Blot representative of three experiments. (G) Quantification of microvessel density
  by CD31 staining was performed counting 5 random fields for section, each slide
  having five sections (magnification, ×2). #P<0.05 vs. ALDH1A1KD group. (H) Representative
  images of immunostaining for CD31 (red) and DAPI (blue) in tumor sections from ALDH1A1SC
  (top), ALDH1A1KD (center) or ALDH1A1+ (bottom) mice. Images show different vessel
  densities in tumors. Magnification, ×20. (I) Bright-field image (magnification,
  ×4) of skin 3D spheroids and multicellular melanoma 3D tumorspheres consisting in
  A375 cells, HaCaT, NHDF and HUVECs co-cultured in ultralow attachment plates for
  6 days. Scale bar=100 µm. Quantification of 3D multicellular spheres. The area occupied
  by spheres was calculated using Fiji Software and three images for each well were
  quantified. Spheres >100 pixel square were considered. ##P<0.01 vs. ALDH1A1KD. (J)
  Bright-field images obtained at magnification ×20 after fixation in paraformaldehyde
  and mounting in Fluoromount aqueous mounting medium. Scale bar=50 µm. (K) GFP-HUVECS
  localization in skin and melanoma 3D models. Fluorescence imaging demonstrated distribution
  of ECs (green) inside 3D spheroids. Merged images show blood vessel-like tubules
  of green HUVECs (×20 magnification). Scale bar=50 µm. (L) Z-stack images obtained
  through a confocal microscope show bifurcation of HUVECs tubules in A375 ALDH1A1+
  3D tumorspheres (magnification, ×63; scale bar=50 µm). (M) Notch pathway genes in
  HUVECs co-cultured with A375 ALDH1A1+ vs. HUVECs co-cultured with A375 ALDH1A1SC
  sorted from multicellular melanoma 3D tumorspheres. Data are reported as fold change
  relative to A375 ALDH1A1SC, assigned to 1. **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs ALDH1A1SC.
  (N) Notch pathway genes under/overexpressed in HUVECs co-cultured with the A375
  ALDH1A1+ cells vs. HUVECs co-cultured with the A375 ALDH1A1KD cells sorted from
  multicellular melanoma 3D tumorspheres. **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs ALDH1A1KD. Data
  are reported as fold change relative to A375 ALDH1A1KD, assigned to 1. HUVECs, human
  umbilical vein endothelial cells; SC, scrambled control; GFP, green fluorescent
  protein; ECs, endothelial cells.'
