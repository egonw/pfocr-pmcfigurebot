caption: Schematic model describing the effect and molecular mechanism of serpinE2
  regulates collagen secretion in cardiac fibrosis. SerpinE2 was endocytosed by cardiac
  fibroblasts through the membrane protein LRP and uPAR through lipid-raft dependent
  endocytosis, this process then activated the intracellular signaling ERK1/2 and
  β-catenin signaling pathway to promote synthesis of collagen in cardiac fibroblasts.
