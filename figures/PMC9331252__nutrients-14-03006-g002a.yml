caption: 'Effect of nCGA on the migration of OH cultured VSMCs. A7r5 cells were treated
  with OH and nCGA (0, 40, 80 and 120 μM) for 24–48 h. Migration was determined using
  the (A) Wound healing assay and (B) Transwell assay. The quantitative data are presented
  as the mean ± SD from a minimum of three independent experiments. # p < 0.05 as
  compared to the C (control). * p < 0.05 as compared to the OH group.'
