  sensitizer
caption: A STRING network analysis of interactions between AZD8186 (left) and capivasertib
  (right) sensitisation genes identified in at least two lines (n = 28 for AZD8186
  and n = 15 for capivasertib). Node size corresponds to drug sensitization effect
  (mean gRNA FC for each gene across cell lines). Node colour represents pathway or
  function associated with gene. Smallest and largest node represents a FC of −1.5
  and −8, respectively. Colour and size of node on STRING network were modified manually.
  B Heatmap representing synergy scores from a 5-day combination proliferation assay
  in EVSA-T, HCC70 and ZR-75-1 cells. Synergy scores determined using the Loewe additivity
  model. C Apoptosis induction analysed by Annexin V staining after 2-hour treatment.
  Data are mean ± SD; n = 3. D Crystal violet staining after 4-day treatment. E Western
  blot analysis in EVSA-T (Ei) and HCC70 (Eii) treated with AZD5991, AZD8186, AZD4320
  or in combination. Data shown is representative of two independent experiments.
  For EVSA-T, 50 nM AZD5991, 500 nM AZD4320, 250 nM AZD8186 were used. For HCC70,
  200 nM AZD5991, 100 nM AZD8186 and 500 nM AZD4320 were used.

  inhibitors in PTEN-null breast cancer and can be overcome by combining with Mcl-1
  inhibitors.
