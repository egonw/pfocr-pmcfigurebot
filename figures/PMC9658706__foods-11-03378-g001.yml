caption: Effect of iron free lactoferrin (apo-LF) on inflammatory cytokines of primary
  intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in the co-culture system (primary IECs and immune
  cells). The concentration of (A) pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α, (B) pro-inflammatory
  cytokine IL-6, (C) pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β and (D) anti-inflammatory cytokine
  IFN-γ in the cell supernatant. Lactoferrin (LF) represents apo-LF. Apo-LF represents
  individual treatment with 10 g/L apo-LF, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) represents individual
  treatment with 1 mg/L LPS and apo-LF + LPS represents combined treatment with of
  10 g/L apo-LF and 1 mg/L LPS. Data analyzed were presented as means ± SD. ** p <
  0.01, *** p < 0.001.
