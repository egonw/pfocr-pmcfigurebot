caption: PCAT19 represses endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenic sprouting, and
  cardiac organoid vascularization(A) Endothelial cell proliferation measured by percentage
  EdU-positive cells after LNA GapmeR-mediated knockdown of PCAT19 (P19) or negative
  control (CTL). Scale bars, 100 μm; n = 3 biological replicates, unpaired t test.
  Representative shown.(B) Endothelial cell proliferation measured by percentage EdU-positive
  cells after overexpression (OE) of PCAT19 (P19) or pcDNA3.1+ control (CTL). Scale
  bars, 100 μm; n = 6 biological replicates, unpaired t test. Representative images
  shown.(C and D) Endothelial cell spheroid outgrowth assay after LNA GapmeR-mediated
  knockdown of PCAT19 (P19) or negative control (CTL) LNA GapmeR (C) or overexpression
  of PCAT19 (P19) or pcDNA3.1+ control (CTL) (D). Spheroids were treated with and
  without VEGF-A. Scale bars, 100 μm; n = 3 biological replicates, one-way ANOVA.
  Representative images shown.(E) Vascularization of cardiac organoids after LNA GapmeR-mediated
  knockdown of PCAT19 (P19) or negative control (CTL). Scale bars, 200 μm; n = 3 biological
  replicates, unpaired t test. Representative images with maximum projection of the
  full z stack.(F) PCAT19 expression in HUVECs seeded at various densities; n = 3,
  one-way ANOVA.(G) Heatmap of top 50 differentially expressed genes after PCAT19
  knockdown. The Z score is displayed (n = 3).(H) Relative gene expression in response
  to PCAT19 knockdown. Dashed line indicates a threshold of padj < 0.05 (n = 3).(I)
  KEGG pathway fold enrichment over background from differentially expressed genes
  (padj < 0.05) after PCAT19 knockdown.(J) Prediction of upstream regulators of differentially
  expressed genes (padj < 0.05) after PCAT19 knockdown using the QuaternaryProd R
  package. Color of outer circles indicates up- or downregulation for that upstream
  regulator. Size of circle indicates number of downstream targets. Thickness of line
  connecting inner and outer circles indicates significance level of that upstream
  regulator. Data are presented as the mean ± SD; ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001,
  ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.
