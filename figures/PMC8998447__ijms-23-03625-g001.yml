caption: Diagram presenting modulation of the autophagy pathway in mammalian nerve
  cells induced by factors used to establish a research PD model. The green arrows
  indicate induction of mRNA/protein expression, whereas the red arrows indicate an
  inhibitory effect of the presented compounds. Additionally, the protein–protein
  interactions are shown, in which the yellow arrows indicate induction of mRNA/protein
  expression, whereas the black arrows indicate an inhibitory effect.
