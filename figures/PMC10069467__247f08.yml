caption: Correlation between differential gene expression and CCN hierarchy in cancer.
  (A) Boxplot showing significance [−log10(P-value)] of RP increase from normal colon
  to CRC. Loci were grouped according to RP of normal colon. For instance, 0.1 in
  the x axis means the annular area defined by a radius ranging from 0 to 0.2 in the
  Poincaré disk. The horizontal dashed line indicates −log10(0.05). (B) Bars showing
  the ratio of down-regulated genes (left) and that of up-regulated genes (right)
  in CRC for genes in each group. The horizontal dashed lines indicate the proportion
  of corresponding differentially expressed genes in all genes. Enriched functions
  for colon-specific (C) and CRC-specific genes (D) in the highest hierarchy class.
  For each bar representing a pathway, the average TPM fold change (log2) of involved
  genes from normal colon to CRC is manifested by the bar color. The vertical dashed
  lines indicate FDR-adjusted P-value equaling 0.05.
