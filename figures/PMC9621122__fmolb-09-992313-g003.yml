caption: 'Differential expression analysis for proteomic data in HeLa. (A) Heatmap
  for all proteins (associated and not associated with genes) differentially expressed.
  Plot shows the expression pattern for the 3 biological replicates of genotype ALMS1
  +/+ (CT) and genotype ALMS1 −/− (KO). (B) Principal components analysis (PCA) for
  the top 500 variable proteins with all biological replicates for each genotype.
  (C) Volcano-plot showing the top 40 most significant genes associated with proteins.
  Proteins with no clear gene association were removed from this plot. Significant
  thresholds: |log2FC| > 1.5, adj p-value < 0.05. This experiment was carried out
  in triplicate (n = 3).'
