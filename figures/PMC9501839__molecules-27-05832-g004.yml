caption: Plasma suppressed MM cell colony formation by inhibiting the Notch pathway.
  (A) Heatmap of cancer stem cell PCR arrays of LP-1 cells after Ar plasma treatment.
  Real-time PCR was performed for Notch-pathway-related genes (Hes1, Hes5, Hey1, Hey2,
  Heyl, Notch1, Notch2, and Dll1) after 24 h of Ar plasma treatment in (B) RPMI8226,
  (C) MMS-1, and (D) LP-1 cells. (E) MMS-1 and (F) LP-1 cells were treated with 10
  μM DAPT for four days, and treated with Ar plasma for 20 s and 40 s, then plated
  in the CFC assay to assess clonogenic ability. Data represent the mean ± SD; * p
  < 0.05; ** p < 0.01 (Student’s t test).
