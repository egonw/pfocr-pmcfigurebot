caption: Enriched pathway visualization with KEGG Mapper Color. DEG-mapped pathway
  visualization presented that DEGs were mainly involved in “Signal transduction metabolism”,
  such as the PI3K/Akt, JAK/STAT, and Notch signaling pathways, and were specifically
  enriched in “PI3K/Akt signaling pathway”. All pathways were directed towards “Sustained
  Angiogenesis”, “Evading Apoptosis”, and “Proliferation”.
