caption: 'HIF1α contributes to TIM/TOM subunit expression. (A) Gene set enrichment
  analysis of the HIF pathway in iWAT Mpst−/− HFD mice. Data were obtained from RNA-seq.
  (B) HIF1α expression is upregulated in iWAT of Mpst−/− HFD mice. (C) Representative
  Western blot and quantitation of HIF1α in nuclear extracts of iWAT from WT and Mpst−/−
  HFD mice. FC, fold change; H3, histone 3. (D–F) Differentiated adipocytes were exposed
  to hypoxia (1% O2, 48 h; D), CoCl2 (300 μM, 24 h; E), or DMOG (1 mM, 48 h; F), and
  the expression levels of selected TIM/TOM complex components were measured by real-time
  PCR. (G and H) A nondegradable form of HIF1α was overexpressed in differentiated
  3T3L1 adipocytes, and Tomm6, Tomm7, and Tomm40l levels were evaluated. Empty vector
  used a negative control. HIF1α was HA-tagged, so only the overexpressed HIF1α is
  detected using a HA antibody. (I) Venn diagram showing total and HIF1α-associated
  downregulated DEGs as defined by the respective RNA-seq and ChIP-seq datasets. GO
  enrichment analysis regarding Cellular Component of HIF1α-associated DEGs. (J) ChIP-seq
  was performed in the iWAT of Mpst−/− HFD; binding of HIF1α at the promoters of Tomm7
  and Tomm6 and at the proximal DNA regulatory regions of respiratory complex subunits
  Cox14, Ndufv1, and Atp5g1 genes. The relative length of the represented genomic
  loci is also indicated. (K) HIF1α expression is upregulated in adipocytes from Mpst−/−
  mice. (L) H2O2 levels were measured using Amplex red in adipocytes from the two
  genotypes. (M) WT adipocytes were exposed to menadione (5 μM), H202 (150 μM), or
  pyrogallol (100 μM) for 24 h, and HIF1α mRNA levels were measured by RT-PCR. (N)
  Mpst−/− adipocytes were incubated for 24 h in 1% O2 in the absence or presence of
  ROS scavengers (ROSi: a combination of DMSO 130 mM, α-tocopherol 50 μM, and Tiron
  10 mM) or Na2S3 (100 μM), and HIF1α mRNA levels were determined by RT-PCR. Gene
  expression and protein expression are presented as ratio over WT HFD (C), 21% O2
  (D), vehicle (E, F, and M), vector (H), WT (K and L), and Mpst−/− (N) group. Data
  are presented as means ± SEM; *, P < 0.05; **, P ≤ 0.01; ***, P ≤ 0.001 (for M,
  * vs. vehicle; for N, vs. Mpst−/−); A and B, n = 3; C, n = 5; I, n = 1–3; J, n =
  1 mouse/mice per group; D–F, H, K–M, n = 5–8; G, n = 1 individual cell cultures
  per group. Source data are available for this figure: .'
