figure_title: B-cell responses were inhibited by DHODH inhibitor (Orludodstat) comparable
  to DSF and can be restored by Uridine, but not DSF
caption: 'a B-cell cluster formation after stimulation with IL-4 plus anti-CD40 antibody
  or LPS with or without pre-treatment with indicated concentrations of Orludodstat.
  Numbers of B cells (b) and CD138+ plasma cells (c) recovered after 4-day culture
  in the presence of indicated concentrations of Orludodstat, stimulated by IL-4 plus
  anti-CD40 (upper panel) or LPS (lower panel), and effect of uridine added to the
  B cell culture on the inhibitory effect of Orludodstat (NC, unstimulated, n = 6;
  IL4+anti-CD40, n = 6; LPS, n = 6; stimulated in the presence of Orludodstat, n = 3
  biologically independent samples). d Simplified schematic of pyrimidine synthesis
  in de novo synthesis and salvage pathways. Effect of uridine added to the B-cell
  culture on the inhibitory effect of DSF on B cells (e) and CD138+ plasma cells (f)
  recovered after stimulation with IL4+anti-CD40 (upper panel) or LPS (lower panel)
  (NC, unstimulated, n = 6; IL4 + aCD40, n = 6; LPS, n = 6; stimulated in the presence
  of DSF, n = 3 biologically independent samples). DSF decreased the salvage pathway-driven
  B cell response induced by inhibition of the de novo pathway by the DHODH inhibitor
  and addition of uridine in B220+ cells (g) or CD138+ plasma cells (h) (n = 3 biologically
  independent samples). Significance was calculated using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s
  post-hoc test: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. Data are shown
  as the mean ± SEM. d was generated using Servier Medical Art, licensed under a Creative
