caption: 'BDNF possibly alleviates DHT-induced GCs apoptosis by upregulating the PI3K/AKT
  pathway. DHT-induced GCs were treated with BDNF and LY294002 with or without DHT.
  (A) GCs were incubated with annexin V-FITC and PI. The cells were imaged for apoptosis
  detection using a FV3000 Olympus microscope. (B,C) Apoptosis protein expression
  of cleaved caspase-3 was analyzed and quantified using Image-J software (60×). (D,E)
  The expression levels of PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT, and p-AKT were detected by Western blot
  assay. Data are shown as mean ± SEM. ** p < 0.05, vs. DMSO group; ## p < 0.01, vs.
  DHT group; && p < 0.01, vs. DHT + BDNF group.'
