caption: BMSCs-EVs carried miR-206 into OS cells. A) Bioinformatics analysis showed
  that the expression of miR-206 in GSE28423 OS samples was lower than that in control
  samples. The EVs were treated differently, and the expression of miR-206 in EVs
  was detected by RT-qPCR (B,C). The OS cells were treated with EVs from different
  groups, and the expression of miR-206 in OS cells was detected by RT-qPCR (D). Three
  cell tests were performed and the data were expressed as mean Â± SD. Independent
  t-test was used for comparison between two groups in panel (A) and one-way ANOVA
  was used for comparison among groups in panels (B-D). Tukey's multiple comparisons
  test was used for post-hoc test; **p<0.01.
