caption: miR-369-3p is a crucial miRNA. (a) Top differentially expressed or crucial
  miRNAs are listed. (b) qPCR validation of differentially expressed key miRNAs (∗P
  < 0.05 vs. HuFCs-exosomes; ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. HuFCs-exosomes; t-test; n = 4). (c) The
  intersection of the miRNA-Seq results and the qPCR results. (d) Target predictions
  indicated more than one target for miR-369-3p (total context ++ score ≤ −0.26).
  (e) GO analysis showed that the target genes of miR-369-3p were most significant
  in the terms “cellular process,” “molecular interaction,” and “cellular anatomical
  entities.” (f) KEGG analysis showed that the genes were involved in the gonadotropin-releasing
  hormone receptor pathway and the Huntington disease pathway.
