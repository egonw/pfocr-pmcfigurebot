caption: Localized vPD1/IL-12 treatment induces high levels of TNF. Syngeneic C57/Bl6
  mice were injected SQ on both the left and right flanks with B16/F10 cells. Tumors
  were allowed to establish and then either mock treated or treated with three IT
  injections of vPD1, vIL-12, or vPD1/IL-12 (n=3 for all groups). Six days after the
  initiation of treatment, total RNA was extracted from each tumor and analyzed using
  RNA-seq. (A) Unsupervised principle component analysis of gene expression from the
  indicated cohorts. (B) Gene Ontology pathway analysis of all genes which were differentially
  expressed between vPD1/IL-12 treated mice and all other cohorts. (C) Volcano plot
  showing the expression of all cytokines and interleukins. Data shown compare tumors
  treated with vPD1/IL-12 to tumors treated with control virus. (D) ELISA data showing
  expression of IFN and TNF protein in the supernatants of tumors 8â€‰days after being
  treated as indicated. (E) Analysis of RNA-seq data (from A) demonstrating the presence
  of previously identified gene response signatures to IFN and TNF. FC, fold change;
  IFN, interferon; IL-12, interleukin 12; IT, intratumoral; MYXV, myxoma virus; PD1,
  programmed cell death protein 1; SQ, subcutaneously; TNF, tumor necrosis factor;
  vGFP, virus expressing green fluorescent protein; vPD1, virus expressing PD1; vPD1/IL-12,
  virus expressing PD1 and IL-12.
