caption: Functional enrichment analysis of 106 immune-related differentially expressed
  genes (IR-DEGs). (A) Gene Ontology (GO). The bar plot shows the top 50 enriched
  IR-DEGs from GO analysis. Blue, green, and red represent biological process (BP),
  cellular component (CC), and molecular function (MF) GO terms, respectively. (B)
  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway. Different colors and sizes
  of bubbles represent different p values and gene counts of a pathway.
