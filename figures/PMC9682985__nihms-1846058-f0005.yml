caption: Amyloid-β (Aβ) (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration (N) in relation to cognition.
  Estimates of association with longitudinal preclinical Alzheimer’s cognitive composite
  changes of Aβ positron emission tomography (PET), 18F-flortaucipir (FTP) standardized
  uptake value ratio, and adjusted hippocampal volume (aHCV), as well as their interactions
  in a linear mixed-effects model in 299 participants with longitudinal cognitive
  data. The error bars indicate 95% confidence interval of the estimated β coefficient.
  Aβ*FTP, Aβ*aHCV, aHCV*FTP, and Aβ*FTP*aHCV indicate the interaction between Aβ and
  FTP; Aβ and aHCV; aHCV and FTP; and Aβ, and FTP and aHCV, respectively. *p < .05;
  **p < .01.
