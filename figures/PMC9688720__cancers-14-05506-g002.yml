caption: Enrichment of significant pathways in RTMs. (A) Differences in 50 hallmark
  pathway activities scored with GSVA software. The pathways highlighted were shown
  with red font. (B) Heatmap showing the expression of immune checkpoint molecules
  across 10 macrophage clusters. (C) The t-SNE plot of macrophages divided into RTM
  group and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) group. (D) Volcano plot exhibiting
  key differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between RTMs and TAMs. (E) KEGG analysis
  of upregulated DEGs. (F) GSEA showing significant enrichment of phagosome pathway
  and antigen processing and presentation pathway in RTMs.
