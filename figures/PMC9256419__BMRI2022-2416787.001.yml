caption: SaiRNA-mediated CIRP silencing in HEK293T cells. (a) The schematic images
  of the constructed pAAV-SaiRNA vector. (b) The guide sequence which targets the
  exon 2 of CIRP gene was used to construct pAAV-SaiCIRP vector. (c) Sanger sequencing
  for clone verification of the pAAV-SaiCIRP vector. (d) Represent fluorescent images
  of HEK293T cells after transfection of the pAAV-SaiCIRP vector at 48 hours. (e and
  f) The mRNA and protein expression of CIRP. HEK293T cells were transfected with
  pAAV-CIRP vector or pAAV-SaiRNA vector as a control for 3 days; then, these cells
  were subjected to RT-qPCR analysis and western blot analysis. The statistical data
  were presented as mean ± SD from at least three independent experiments, ∗∗∗P <
  0.001.
