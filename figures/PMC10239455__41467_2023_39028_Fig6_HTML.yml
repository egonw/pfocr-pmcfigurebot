figure_title: Metabolomics profiles of mice with HiAlc Kpn-induced steatohepatitis
caption: a Orthogonal partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA); b Volcano
  plot of differential metabolites; c KEGG pathways enriched in upregulated metabolites;
  d KEGG pathways enriched in downregulated metabolites; e differential metabolites
  between groups of mice fed with HK1 and HK1/phiW14. f OPLS-DA; g volcano plot of
  differential metabolites; h KEGG pathways enriched in upregulated metabolites; i
  KEGG pathways enriched in downregulated metabolites; j differential metabolites
  between groups of mice fed with HK1 and HK1/IMP. Values are expressed as the mean ± SD
  (n = 6 mice/group). Differential metabolites with P value < 0.05 and VIP value > 1
  were chosen for Metabo Analyst-based KEGG pathway enrichment analysis.
