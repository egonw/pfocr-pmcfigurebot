caption: The effects of HMGA2 on brain injury induced inflammatory response. (a) Quantitative
  PCR was performed to examine the mRNA expression level of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and
  IL-18 cerebral infarction. (b) Western blot was used to explore the protein expression
  level of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-18 after cerebral infarction. ∗∗p < 0.01 vs.
  sham or MCAO + sh-NC. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM.
