caption: 'Ingenuity pathway analysis reveals activation of inflammatory signaling
  at the transcription and translation level in BMDMs. A, Scatter plot of Benjamini-Hochberg
  (B–H) adjusted P of significantly dysregulated processes/functions in Disease and
  Disorder analysis of the transcriptome and translatome of miR-223−/− BMDMs compared
  with WT BMDMs. A B-H adjusted P cutoff of 0.05 (−log10[B-H adjusted P] >1.3) was
  applied and all accepted processes/functions were shown as individual dots. B, Top
  plot: scatter plot of B-H adjusted P of significantly dysregulated processes/functions
  in the Inflammatory Response sub-category of miR-223−/− BMDMs compared with that
  of WT BMDMs. A B-H adjusted P cut-off of 0.05 (−log10[B-H adjusted P] >1.3) was
  applied, and all accepted processes/functions were shown as individual dots. Bottom
  plot: activation z-score of top 5 differentially regulated pathways in the Inflammatory
  Response sub-category of miR-223−/− BMDMs compared with that of WT BMDMs. The cell
  is gray when an activation z-score cannot be determined by IPA. C, Heatmap of average
  miR-233−/−/WT fold change of representative inflammatory response genes at the RNA
  and ribosome protected fragment (RPF) level. All genes associated with all processes/functions
  in B were combined, then their clustering was calculated based on their fold change
  (miR-233−/−/WT) values using the Average Linkage method. D, Occurrence of AUUUA
  motif in the 3’UTR of all genes vs upregulated genes in miR-223−/− BMDMs. Normalized
  count values were compared using Mann-Whitney U test. RPF indicates ribosome protected
  fragment.'
