caption: Akt inhibitor could further regulate the expression level of NF‐κB in GC
  cells. MKN‐45 and MGC‐803 cells were treated with ipatasertib, a specific inhibitor
  of Akt, and DEC1, p‐Akt and NF‐κB p65 protein expression were detected by Western
  blot. All the experiments were repeated three times. EV, empty vector; OV, overexpression
  vector. *p < 0.05

  by regulating Akt/NF‐κB pathway.
