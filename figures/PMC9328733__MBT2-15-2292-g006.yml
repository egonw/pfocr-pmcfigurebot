caption: Metabolomics analysis of yeast strain SQ3‐3 grown in YPD with yeast extract
  from different sources. (A) Time course of squalene production in shake flask cultivation
  with yeast extract from different sources (YE‐O and YE‐N). (B) Differential pathway
  analysis based on metabolomics. Each bubble in the bubble chart represents a metabolic
  pathway. Impact values on the abscissa represent the influence degree of the pathway
  in the topology analysis. The ‐lnP‐value on ordinate is the negative natural logarithm
  of P‐value, which represents the significant differences of the enrichment analysis.
  Data are presented as the means of four biological replicates. Error bars represent
  standard deviations (n = 4).
