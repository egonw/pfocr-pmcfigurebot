figure_title: Knockout strains reveal antibiotic-specific effects of purine and pyrimidine
  synthesis on ΔMIC for streptomycin and carbenicillin
caption: 'A) Simulation: Genes identified by FBA and OptKnock that are involved in
  nucleotide synthesis and that increase ATPsyn/biomass above wildtype (wt). Dark
  blue bars indicate pyrC and purK. FBA parameters in . Positions of PyrC and PurK
  in nucleotide synthesis pathway shown in .B) Simulations: FBA predicted effects
  on ATP synthesis (ATPsyn) for wt, ΔpyrC, and ΔpurK.C) Simulation: FBA predicted
  effects on biomass for wt, ΔpyrC, and ΔpurK.D) Removal of pyrC increases [ATP],
  while removal of purK decreases [ATP], relative to wildtype. Error bars = SEM. Average
  from 3 biological replicates. * indicates different than wildtype (P < 0.01, two-tailed
  t-test). For D and E, raw data in  and all P values in .E) Removal of pyrC and purK
  decreases growth rate relative to wildtype. Error bars = SEM. Average from ≥ 5 biological
  replicates. * indicates different than control (P < 0.001, two-tailed t-test). Residuals
  for curve fitting in .F) Removal of pyrC and purK increases log[ATP]/growth rate
  relative to wildtype. Data from panels D and E.G) ΔMIC of streptomycin (strp). Error
  bars = SEM. Average plotted from ≥ 5 biological replicates. * = different than wildtype
  (two-tailed t-test, P = 0.038), ** not different than zero (one-tailed t-test, P
  = 0.211). For G and H, raw data in .H) ΔMIC of carbenicillin (carb). Error bars
  = SEM. Average plotted from ≥ 4 biological replicates. * = different than wildtype
  (P < 0.025, two-tailed t-test). ** not different than zero (one-tailed t-test, P
  = 0.211).'
