figure_title: CRMP2 derived from CAFs contributes to poor prognosis in OvCA patients
caption: A IHC analysis showed the expression of α-SMA and CRMP2 in epithelial ovarian
  cancer (EOC) tissues and para-carcinoma tissues (100×magnification, the zoomed-in
  section, 200×magnification). B Tissue microarray (TMA) containing 118 EOC patients
  was used to analyze expression of α-SMA and CRMP2 in non-and metastatic cases. C
  High expression of CRMP2 was correlated with tumor metastases. D, E Both Kaplan–Meier
  plotter and TMA analyses validated the high expression of CRMP2 that was related
  to poor prognosis. F There were α-SMA and CRMP2 co-expression in tumor stroma via
  immunofluorescence analysis (yellow arrow). No signal was detected in para-carcinoma
  tissues (200×magnification, the zoomed-in section, 400×magnification). Red and green
  fluorescence signal represented the expression of CRMP2 and α-SMA, respectively.
  While the yellow fluorescence signal represented co-expression. G, H CRMP2 + /α-SMA + represented
  the co-expression group, and the double positive group was associated with tumor
  metastases and probability of survival. I A schematic diagram showed that CRMP2
  was secreted from CAFs and then stimulate the down-stream HIF-1α-glycolysis and
  HIF-1α-VEGFA signaling pathway to regulate the progression of ovarian cancer. OS
  overall survival, PPS post progression survival, PFS progression free survival.
