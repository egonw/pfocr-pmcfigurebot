caption: 'Curcumin relieves the ER stress strongly activated by DHEA in the ovarian
  tissue of PCOS-like rats. (a) The levels of p-IRE1α and XBP1 were measured with
  immunohistochemical staining. (b) The expression of IRE1α, XBP1, GRP-78, and CHOP
  in the ovaries was assessed by qRT-PCR assay. (c, d) The protein expression of p-IRE1α,
  IRE1α, XBP1, GRP-78, and CHOP in ovarian tissues was assessed with western blotting.
  Representative data are displayed, and the relative protein intensity of p-IRE1α,
  IRE1α, XBP1, GRP-78, and CHOP was normalized to GAPDH. Three independent experiments
  were performed with similar results. Data are shown as the mean ± SEM. ∗∗p < 0.05
  vs. control group; ##p < 0.05 vs. PCOS group.'
