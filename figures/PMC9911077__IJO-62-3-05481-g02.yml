caption: α-hederin overcomes drug resistance in CRC cells under hypoxic conditions
  by promoting apoptosis. (A) Flow cytometry and (B) JC-1 immunofluorescence assays
  were used to evaluate the apoptosis of hypoxic CRC cells treated with α-hederin.
  (C) ELISA was used to observe the activities of cytochrome c and Caspase-3 after
  α-hederin treatment. (D) Western blot analysis was used to measure the expression
  levels of apoptosis-related proteins after α-hederin treatment of CRC cells under
  hypoxia; β-actin blot is the loading control blot for all of the proteins. Data
  are presented as the mean ± SD. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 vs. vehicle. CRC, colorectal cancer;
  PI, propidium iodide.
