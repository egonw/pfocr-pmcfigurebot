caption: Mitochondrial signaling pathway analysis treated upon apigetrin. Apigetrin
  was administered to HepG2 cells at a dosage of (0, 50, and 100 µM) for 48 h. Cells
  were collected, and proteins were harvested by immunoblot. Bax, Bcl-xL, p-BAD, and
  cleaved caspase 9 were quantified by Western blot. The results obtained from three
  independent experiments are expressed as mean ± standard error of mean (SEM) and
  compared with the control group. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
