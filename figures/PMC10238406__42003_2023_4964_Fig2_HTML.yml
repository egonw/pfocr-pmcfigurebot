figure_title: RNA-seq analysis of liver burn response in young and old mice
caption: a Volcano plot showing genes responding to burn stimuli in young mice. b
  Volcano plot showing genes responding to burn stimuli in aged mice. c Venn diagram
  showing overlap of genes with up-regulated expression by burn stimuli in both aged
  and young mice. d Venn diagram showing overlap of genes with down-regulated expression
  by burn stimuli in both aged and young mice. e Sankey diagram of KEGG pathway from
  overrepresentation analysis based on overlapping up-regulated genes (panel C). f
  Sankey diagram of KEGG pathway from overrepresentation analysis based on overlapping
  down-regulated genes (panel D). g Volcano plot showing differential liver gene expression
  between aged and young mice after burn stimuli. h KEGG pathway overrepresentation
  analysis of genes down-regulated in aged burn mice vs young burn mice. For panels
  e, f and h, only pathways meeting the following criteria were shown. Size term < 200,
  intersection > 3, Benjamini–Hochberg adj. p-value < 0.05. N = 3 per group.
