caption: 'Network diagram of the correlation between DAFs and DEGs in the flavonoid
  biosynthetic pathway of L. polystachyus. (a) Correlation network diagram between
  DAFs in different organ comparison groups. (b) Correlation network diagram between
  DAFs at different growth and development stage comparison groups. (c) Correlation
  network diagram between DEGs in different organ comparison groups. (d) Correlation
  network diagram between DEGs in the comparison groups at different growth and development
  stages. (e) Correlation network diagram between DAFs and DEGs in different organ
  comparison groups. (f) Correlation network diagram between DAFs and DEGs at different
  growth and development stage comparison groups. Pink octagons: DAFs, blue rounds:
  DEGs; orange lines: positive correlations, green lines: negative correlations.'
