figure_title: CB1 regulated sensitivity of TNBC cells to ferroptosis by regulating
  SCD1- and FADS2-dependent fatty acid metabolism
caption: 'A Volcano plot showing fold changes and P-values for fatty acid species
  in rimonabant treated MDA-MB-231 cells compared with vehicle treatment. B Scheme
  showing the n-6 fatty acid and n-9 fatty acid partial synthesis pathway. n-6 fatty
  acid pathway: OA oleic acid, LA linoleic acid, EDA eicosadienoic acid, DGLA dihomo-γ-linolenic
  acid, AA arachidonic acid, AdA adrenic acid. n-9 FA pathway: SA stearic acid, OA,
  oleic acid; MA, mead acid. C qPCR analysis of the indicated gene expression associated
  with fatty acid metabolism in MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 cells treated with rimonabant
  or CB1 overexpression. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 (t-test). D WB analysis was conducted
  to detect CB1, SCD1 and FADS2 in MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 cells that were stably transfected
  with control vector, shCB1 or CB1. E–H Effect of SCD1 and FADS2 knockdown on MDA-MB-231
  cells in response to erastin and RSL3 treatment, respectively, using two distinct
  target gene shRNA expression vectors. WB analysis was conducted to detect SCD1 (E)
  and FADS2 (F) in MDA-MB-231 cells that were stably transfected with negative control
  shRNA (shNC), shSCD1 or shFADS2. Dose-response curves of MDA-MB-231 cell stably
  transfected with negative control shRNA (shNC), shSCD1 (G) or shFADS2 (H) treated
  with erastin (left) or RSL3 (right) at the indicated doses. The cell viability was
  assessed by CCK-8 assay after treatment for 72 h with the indicated doses of the
  drugs. I The cell viability of MDA-MB-231 cells stably transfected with empty vector,
  CB1, shFADS2 was treated with erastin (5 μM) or RSL3 (0.5 μM). Cell viability was
  assessed by CCK-8 assay after treatment for 72 h with the indicated doses of the
  drugs. ns (no significance), **p < 0.01 (one-way ANOVA). J Effect of CB1 overexpression,
  SCD1 and FADS2 knockdown on lipid peroxidation response to erastin (up) and RSL3(down)
  treatment, respectively, in MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 cells. Data shown are mean ± SD
  of triplicate measurements that were repeated three times with similar results.'
