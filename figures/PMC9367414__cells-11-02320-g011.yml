caption: Network analysis of gene expression related to “map3k2”. Blue to red graduation
  represents gene expressions from low to high. Diamond, round or triangle nodes represent
  genes that are predominant in growing, static or retracting tips, respectively.
  Rectangular gray nodes represent genes that are important but not present in the
  sequencing lists. Six nodes (bottom left) are isolated because of their indirect
  linkage to the network (ptprga, hhipl1, acox, stk38b), or possibly different connections
  from their isoforms [mapk8(2), mapk14(β)]. Node mapk1 (erk) is referenced for its
  particularly high expression level (2.9) in retracting tips. Enrichment analysis
  indicated that nodes in this network are related to the “MAPK signaling pathway”
  or to the “JNK cascade”.
