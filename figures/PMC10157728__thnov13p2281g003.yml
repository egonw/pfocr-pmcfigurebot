caption: HSF1 is involved in multiple cellular functions. HSF1 is involved in various
  cellular functions to maintain normal physiological status. Moreover, some of these
  functions of HSF1 may also play an essential role in cancer development such as
  cell cycle regulation to control cell proliferation, cell death pathway activation,
  mitochondrial function, important to cope with the oxidative stress, tumor microenvironment
  (TME)-cancer crosstalk to promote malignancy, cellular metabolism related to the
  equilibrium between energy storage and expenditure, and immunology which is now
  mainstream for cancer therapy.
