caption: mTOR cooperatively activates H3T3ph via VRK1 in the context of mutant KRAS.(A)
  Effects of mTOR inhibition on mRNA expression of VRK1 in A549 and SW480 cell was
  examined by real-time PCR. (B) Western blot was used to detect the effect of different
  concentrations of mTOR inhibition on the expression of VRK1 protein in SW480 cells.
  (C) Western blots demonstrated VRK1 protein knockout (KO) after treatment with sgRNA
  in SW480 cells. (D) Detection of H3T3ph protein level by western blot in SW480 cells
  expressing empty vector control or sgRNA targeting VRK1, untreated or treated with
  600nM CHR-6494 for 72 h. (E) Western blots verified the expression level of VRK1
  protein and the activity of mTOR signaling pathway in KRAS wild-type cells (KRAS-WT),
  KRAS mutated cells (KRAS-Mut), and KRAS mutated cells inhibited by mTOR inhibitor
  CCI-779. (F) Real-time PCR demonstrated the overexpression (OE) of KRAS-G12V mutations
  in HT29 cells. (G) Western blot analyzed on HT29 cells expressing either empty vector
  control or KRAS-G12V mutations, untreated or treated with mTOR inhibitor CCI-779
  (3μM) showed changes in VRK1 and H3T3ph protein levels. (H) Western blot was used
  to detect the expression of VRK1 and H3T3ph in vector control SW480 cells with CCI-779
  treatment or VRK1 KO SW480 cells treated with mTOR activator leucine (3mM). Data
  are expressed as means ± SD of the three experiments, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
