caption: Working model of ferroptosis in EAE pathogenesis. During EAE development,
  ACSL4 mediates ferroptosis to induce inflammation and promote the activation of
  T cells through the TCR signaling pathway, thus driving T-cell-mediated neuroinflammation
  and demyelination in the spinal cord, which induces EAE pathology. This fiugre was
  created with BioRender.com.
