caption: CD206 response to TPA treatment in ML-1 monocytes. TPA increases the expression
  levels of CD206, a biomarker for the differentiation of ML-1 monocytes to macrophages.
  ML-1 monocytes were treated with 0.3 ng/mL TPA for 72 h which was followed by replacement
  of old media with fresh media, followed by re-culturing of cells for 72 h. The relative
  CD206 mRNA was evaluated by real-time PCR and data were normalized using GAPDH as
  the housekeeping gene (data represent mean ± standard errors of the mean, n = 3.
  *p < 0.05 vs monocyte). Student’s t tests were performed to obtain statistical significance
  (p value). (A color version of this figure is available in the online journal.)
