caption: 'The rescue effects of the autophagy inhibitor, 3-MA, on stellettin B-induced
  cell viability and autophagic proteins. (A) OC2 and SCC4 cells were pre-exposed
  to 1 mM 3-MA prior to exposure to 10 µM stellettin B for 48 h. Cell viability was
  determined using MTT-based assay. (B) Autophagy was evaluated by conducting immunofluorescence
  staining of LC3 proteins (showing green signal), while the nuclei were labeled with
  DAPI (showing blue signal). Scale bar = 50 μm. On the merged images, the white squared
  areas are enlarged and placed on the right shown as zoomed-in. (C) Western blotting
  for autophagy-related proteins p62 and LC3-I/II in OC2 and SCC4 cells after 48 h
  treatment. (D) Quantified levels of p62 and LC3-I/II. Original, uncropped Western
  blot images are displayed in , and error bars stand for the mean ± SE. The data
  are shown for a minimum of three independent trials in triplicate analyzed using
  Student’s t-test to determine significance; * p < 0.05 and # p < 0.05 relative to
  the 3-MA untreated and stellettin B untreated groups, respectively.'
