caption: The expression of VASH1 was downregulated in the ECs of ischemic myocardium
  following AMI. (A) Expression of VASH1 in the left ventricle of mice was detected
  by immunoblotting on day 1, 3, 7 and 14 following surgery. (B) Correlation of the
  expression of VASH1 with ZNF667 in the left ventricle of mice on day 1, 3, 7 and
  14 day following surgery (n=3 per group). (C) Quantification of positive expression
  rate of ZNF667 in CD31-positive cells in the left ventricle of AMI mice (n=5 per
  group). (D) The expression of CD31 and VASH1 were detected by immunohistochemistry
  in the serial left ventricle sections of AMI mice on day 14 day following surgery.
  Scale bar (left)=200 µm, (right)=50 µm. The arrows indicate the co-localization
  of positive expression of CD31 and VASH1. Data are presented as mean ± standard
  deviation. VASH1, vasohibin 1; EC, endothelial cell; AMI, acute myocardial infarction;
  ZNF667, zinc finger protein 667.
