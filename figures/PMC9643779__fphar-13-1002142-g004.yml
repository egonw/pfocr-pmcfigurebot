caption: 'Sunitinib regulates apoptosis and autophagy via MAPKs pathway. (A) Detection
  proteins expression of JNK, P38, ERK and their phosphorylation incubated with Sunitinib
  (15 μM) for 0–48 h. (B) The viability of hepatocytes was analyzed by MTT after L02
  cells were incubated with 5, 10, 15 μM Sunitinib for 24 h in the presence or absence
  of 10 μM SP600125 pretreatment for 2 h (n = 6). (C) The viability of hepatocytes
  was analyzed by MTT after L02 cells were incubated with 5, 10, 15 μM Sunitinib for
  48 h in the presence or absence of 20 μM SB203580 pretreatment for 2 h (n = 6).
  (D) Protein expression of p-JNK, JNK, PARP, and LC3B after L02 cells were incubated
  with 15 μM Sunitinib for 24 h in the presence or absence of 10 μM SP600125 pretreatment
  for 2 h (n = 3). (E) Protein expression of p-P38, P38, PARP, c-Caspase3, and LC3B
  after L02 cells were incubated with 10 μM Sunitinib for 48 h in the presence or
  absence of 20 μM SB203580 pretreatment for 2 h (n = 3). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and
