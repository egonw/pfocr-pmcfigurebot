caption: DEHP may be involved in the pathological process of HCC. DEHP increased the
  expression of IL-6 and TNF-α and effects the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. When
  IL-6 and TNF-α bind to their transmembrane receptors, JAK2 and STAT3 are activated,
  and DEHP activated the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, promoted the expression of
  PD-L1, and then promoted tumor immune escape response

  of PD-L1 by activating the JAK2/STAT3 pathway.'
