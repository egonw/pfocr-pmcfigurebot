caption: 'mir‐99a‐5p negatively regulates TLR8 activation of PI3K/AKT pathway to regulate
  knee cartilage injury in rabbits. (A) KEGG enrichment analysis that PI3K/AKT pathway
  is involved in TLR8‐mediated inflammatory response. (B) Schematic diagram of chondrocyte
  culture. (C) Immunofluorescence staining for TLR8 (red) and DAPI (blue) in the damaged
  cartilage of the knee. Scale bars: 100 μm. (D) Immunofluorescence staining for PI3K
  (red) and DAPI (blue) in the damaged cartilage of the knee. Scale bars: 100 μm.
  (E) Immunofluorescence staining for AKT (red) and DAPI (blue) in the damaged cartilage
  of the knee. Scale bars: 100 μm. (F) Immunofluorescence staining for P65 (red) and
  DAPI (blue) in the damaged cartilage of the knee. Scale bars: 100 μm. (G). Trend
  chart speculated that PI3K, P65, and AKT are synchronized with TLR8 in expression
  change. (H−K) PCR detection the expression levels of TLR8, PI3K, AKT, and P65 of
  cell culture, *p < .05. (L−P) The result of protein level of TLR8, PI3K, AKT, and
  P65 detected by WB，*p < .05. (Q−T) After use the PI3K inhibitor and agonist, the
  express level of AKT and P65 were detected by PCR (Q−S) and WB (T) respectively,
  the change of them is same to PI3K. PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinase; TLR, toll‐like
  receptors; WB, western blot analysis.'
