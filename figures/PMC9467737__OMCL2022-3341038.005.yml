caption: Siglec-15 regulates macrophage inflammatory factors partly dependent on STING.
  (a) BMDMs of bone marrow-derived macrophages from WT and Siglec-15 KO mice were
  extracted, and 50â€‰ng/mL IL-4 stimulated the cells. The proteins were collected according
  to different experimental time points, and the cGAS-STING signaling pathway was
  detected by western blot. (b) BMDMs of bone marrow-derived macrophages from WT and
  Siglec-15 KO mice were extracted, and conditioned medium containing Pan-02 supernatant
  stimulated the cells. The proteins were collected according to different experimental
  time points, and the cGAS-STING signaling pathway was detected by western blot.
  (c) After extracting Sigle-15KO mouse peritoneal primary macrophages, stimulated
  with cisplatin for 24 hours, the protein expression of the cGAS-STING signaling
  pathway conditioned medium containing Pan-02 supernatant was as shown in the figure.
  (d) After extracting Sigle-15KO or Sigle-15 OE mouse peritoneal primary macrophages,
  after IL-4 stimulation, the expression of cGAS-STING signaling pathway molecule
  protein-conditioned medium containing Pan-02 supernatant was as shown. The experiments
  were repeated three times, and each experiment was triplicated.
