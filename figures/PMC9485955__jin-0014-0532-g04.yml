caption: 'miR-142-5p activates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway by targeting PTEN. aVolcano
  map of DEGs in the GSE111241 microarray data. Green represents significantly downregulated
  mRNAs and red represents significantly upregulated mRNAs. bVenn map of hsa-miR-142-5p
  (green) and rno-miR-142-5p (blue) target genes and significantly upregulated genes
  (red) in the GSE111241 microarray data. cThe interaction network of 52 genes analyzed
  using the STRING database (https://string-db.org/). Brighter color of the circle
  reflected a higher degree value of the gene. dThere are seven base pairs of PTEN
  3′-UTR complementary to miR-142-5p (the upper part), and luciferase activity was
  detected by the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay (the lower part). ePTEN mRNA
  level and miR-142-5p expression in lung tissues of rats in response to LPS alone
  or combined with RIPC/miR-142-5p measured by RT-qPCR (n = 6). fProtein levels of
  PTEN and p-AKT/AKT in lung tissues of rats in response to LPS alone or combined
  with RIPC/miR-142-5p measured by the Western blot analysis (n = 6). *p < 0.05 versus
  control rats or LPS-induced septic rats injected with miR control; #p < 0.05 versus
  LPS-induced septic ALI rats. Descriptive data are depicted as the mean ± standard
  deviation. Data from 2 groups were compared by the unpaired t test. Data comparisons
  between multiple groups were conducted by one-way ANOVA with Tukey''s post hoc test.
