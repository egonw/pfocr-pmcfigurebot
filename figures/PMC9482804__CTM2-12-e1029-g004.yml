caption: Enrichment analysis within tumor‐specific genes and biological pathways.
  (A) Pathway enrichment analysis identified 5 tumor‐specific KEGG pathways. (B) Schematic
  flow chart shows the filtering process of identifying tumor‐specific genes enriched
  in group A. (C) A heatmap of genes with high expression in group A. A list of 42
  genes was labelled and furtherly clustered among three groups. The expression rate
  and mean value of each gene was calculated, distinguished and plotted by median
  values, and immune functions of 42 genes were elaborated and identified (Table ).
