figure_title: Depletion of MTOR or RICTOR decreases proliferation of human ALL cells
caption: A Scheme of proliferation competition assay. Parts of the image are taken
  from https://smart.servier.com. B Dot plot proportion of mCherry+ and GFP+ cells
  in flow cytometry at day 0 and after 15 days of culture of a representative experiment,
  in which RCH-ACV cells were transduced with control shRNA (shLuc, Luciferase) or
  shRNA for MTOR (shMTOR) with a mCherry as fluorescence marker. RCH-ACV cells transduced
  with control shRNA (shLuc) with a GFP marker were used as control cells in the competition
  assay and mixed 1:1 at day 0. C–E Western blot analysis (representative of three
  independent experiments) at the top of the panel show protein levels following knockdown
  by different shRNA constructs in RCH-ACV cells. Vinculin was used as loading control.
  Densitometry values were calculated using ImageJ software. Diagrams at the bottom
  show percentage of mCherry+ cells transduced with shRNAs for luciferase (control)
  or different shRNA constructs of (C) MTOR, (D) RICTOR or (E) RPTOR for 30 days.
  Data represent the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments. Statistical analysis
  performed using non-linear regression analysis and curves were compared with the
  sum-of-squares F test. ns not significant, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
