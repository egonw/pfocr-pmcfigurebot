caption: Oxaliplatin promotes ferroptosis and oxidative stress in colorectal cancer
  cells through inhibiting the Nrf2 signaling pathway. (A and B) Detection of relative
  total iron level and Fe2+ level in HT29 cells was performed using an iron ion test
  kit in the control group and the groups treated with 3 µM of oxaliplatin as well
  as oxaliplatin (3 µM) + NK-252. (C and D) Western blotting was used to detect the
  levels of the ferroptosis-related proteins GPX4, FTH1 and transferrin in the control
  group and the groups treated with 3 µM of oxaliplatin as well as oxaliplatin (3
  µM) + NK-252. (E-G) ELISA was used to detect the levels of the oxidative stress-related
  factors ROS, MDA and GSH in the control group and the groups treated with 3 µM of
  oxaliplatin as well as oxaliplatin (3 µM) + NK-252. Data are expressed as mean ±
  SD. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001. Nrf2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor
  2; GPX4, glutathione peroxidase 4; FTH1, ferritin heavy chain 1; ROS, reactive oxygen
  species; MDA, malondialdehyde; GSH, glutathione.
