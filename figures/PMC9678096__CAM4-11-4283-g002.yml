caption: Capsaicin reduced hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) activation, and induced
  HPCs apoptosis in the liver of diethylnitrosamine (DEN)‐induced rats suffering from
  hepatocellular carcinoma. (A) Immunohistochemistry staining showed that the expression
  of HPCs markers, EpCAM, OV6, SOX9 as well as proliferation marker PCNA was decreased
  in the DEN+capsaicin group compared to the DEN group. (B) Tunnel staining showed
  a higher number of apoptotic cells in the DEN+capsaicin group than that in the DEN
  group. (C) Immunofluorescence co‐staining of Caspase‐3 and EpCAM suggested capsaicin‐induced
  HPCs apoptosis in DEN‐treated rat liver. Scale bars, 40 μm
article_title: Capsaicin suppresses hepatocarcinogenesis by inhibiting the stemness
  of hepatic progenitor cells via SIRT1/SOX2 signaling pathway.
