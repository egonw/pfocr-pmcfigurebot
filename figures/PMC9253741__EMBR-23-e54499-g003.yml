figure_title: Topotecan reshapes the transcriptional profile of microglia after systemic
  LPS challenge
caption: 'AMultidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis of brain microglia sorted from
  the following groups (n = 3): naive group (mice received i.p injection of PBS and
  intracisternal injection of PBS), LPS group (mice received i.p injection of 5 mg/kg
  LPS following intracisternal injection of PBS), and TPT group (mice received i.p
  injection of 5 mg/kg LPS following intracisternal injection of 0.1 mg/kg TPT); numbers
  labeled between different clusters indicate the number of differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs) identified by EdgeR (FDR ≤ 0.05).BVolcano plot depicting the DEGs between
  the TPT and LPS groups; dots represent non‐DEGs (grey, FDR > 0.05), DEGs with fold
  change log2FC > 0 (red), and DEGs with log2FC < 0 (blue); genes of interest were
  labeled and plotted in darker colors.CBar plot of the top 50 up‐and downregulated
  DEGs (ordered by FC) between the TPT and LPS groups.DGSEA plot of the enriched KEGG
  pathways related to inflammation between the TPT and LPS groups.E–HHeatmaps plotting
  the changes in expression levels of genes contributing to the enrichment analysis
  of TNF signaling pathway (E) and NF‐κB signaling pathway (F) across samples when
  comparing the TPT group with the LPS group. Dot plots showing the top10 suppressed
  and activated GO terms (G) or KEGG pathways (H) between the TPT and LPS groups.
  The expression levels were calculated by TPM and log2 transformed.IVenn diagrams
  intersected the number of DEGs and transcription factor (TF) predicted to regulate
  the gene expression between the TPT and LPS groups.JThe Scatter plot shows the Irwin‐Hall
  and FDR value of the 8 genes in (I); FDR was obtained from differential expression
  (DE) analysis; Irwin‐Hall P‐value was obtained from BART prediction, indicating
  the integrative ranking significance; the color gradient indicates FC in DE analysis.KBART
  output of association score cumulative distribution of Ikzf1.LBART output of transcriptional
  regulator prediction rank of Ikzf1.M De novo motif enriched in promoters of DEGs
  between the TPT and LPS groups matching to known motifs of Ikzf1 using HOMER.'
