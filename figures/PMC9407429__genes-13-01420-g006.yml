caption: Mapping of ATII miRNAs to TGF-β signaling pathway components. This figure
  represents the canonical TGF-β signaling pathway from the Ingenuity®pathway library.
  Orange arrows and outlines indicate ATII miRNA targeted members within molecule
  families (dark grey icons). Red arrowheads symbolize ATII miRNAs. For example, TGFBR2
  is a member of the type II TGF-β receptors, and its mRNA is targeted by miR-17-5p.
  Compare  for an overview of interactions.
