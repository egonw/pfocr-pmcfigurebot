caption: Cytotoxic potential, NICD production inhibition, and notch target gene expression
  modulation potential of rutin in HCT-116 cells. (A) Effect of rutin on cell viability
  of HCT-116 cells in 24 h treatment at 10–500 µM concentrations. (B) Notch promoter
  activity modulation potential of rutin at IC50 concentration in 48 h and 72 h treatment
  in notch promoter vector transfected HCT-116 cells. (C) Mechanism of gamma secretase
  mediated NICD formation (absence or presence of rutin) and thereby transcription
  of notch promoter region having luciferase enzyme gene. (D) Effect of Notch-1 siRNA
  mediated silencing of Notch-1 in HCT-116 cells survival in 48 h and 72 h transfection.
  (E) mRNA expression of Hes-1, Hey-1, and E-cad in Notch-1 siRNA transfected HCT-116
  cells in 48 h and 72 h treatments. (F) mRNA expression of Hes-1 and Hey-1 after
  48 h and 72 h rutin treatment in HCT-116 cells at an IC50 concentration. (G) mRNA
  expression of Hes-1 and Hey-1 in DAPT (25 µM) treated HCT-116 cells in 48 h and
  72 h treatments. (H) mRNA expression of E-cad after 48 h and 72 h DAPT (25 µM) and
  rutin (IC50 concentration) treatment in HCT-116 cells. Experiments were performed
  in triplicate and represented by mean ± SEM (standard error mean). ** (p < 0.01),
  *** (p < 0.001), **** (p < 0.0001).
