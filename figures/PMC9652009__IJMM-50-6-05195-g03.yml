caption: 'STAT1 is involved in HP-HUVEC-Exos-induced VSMC calcification. VSMCs were
  treated with HP-HUVEC-Exos, HP-HUVEC-Exos + fludarabine, NP-HUVEC-Exos or fresh
  conditioned medium (Ctrl group) for 14 days. (A) Expression levels of OPN and Runx2
  in VSMCs were measured by western blot analysis. (B) Reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR analysis of OPN and Runx2 expression in VSMCs. (C) Alizarin Red S staining revealed
  mineralization. Scale bar, 100 µm. (D) Ca content in VSMCs was measured. (E) ALP
  activity was tested. *P<0.05, ***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001 compared with the Ctrl group.
  #P<0.05, ##P<0.01, ###P<0.001 compared with the HP-HUVEC-Exos + fludarabine group.
  ALP, alkaline phosphatase; Ca, calcium; Ctrl, control; HP, high phosphorus; HUVEC-Exos,
  exosomes from HUVECs; NP, no phosphorus; OPN, osteopontin; Runx2, runt-related transcription
  factor 2; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell.'
article_title: Exosomal STAT1 derived from high phosphorus-stimulated vascular endothelial
  cells induces vascular smooth muscle cell calcification via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway.
