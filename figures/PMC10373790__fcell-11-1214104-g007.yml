caption: 'Regeneration by banked hRPC-derived RGCs. The microfluidic model of hRGC
  axon regeneration following chemical axotomy is depicted schematically (A) in the
  schematic, we show SMI32- and Tau1-positive neurites in the groove, demonstrating
  that they are axons. Banked hRPC-derived RGCs seeded in the Matrigel-coated soma
  chamber elaborate axons through the microgrooves into the axon chamber (). Axons
  are labeled retrogradely with fluorescent CTB followed by detergent-based chemical
  axotomy. Regeneration of CTB/TUJ1-positive axons in axon chamber is quantified for
  their number and length under different culture conditions. The upper panel shows
  CTB-stained hRGCs axons in the axon chamber in different groups’ pre-axotomy (B).
  The middle panel shows saponin-mediated axotomy in the axon chamber (C). The lower
  panels show axon regeneration when cells in the soma chamber are exposed to IGF-1,
  IGF-1+PPP, and IGF-1+rapamycin post-axotomy versus controls (D). Both the length
  and number of axons increase significantly in the presence of IGF-1 versus controls,
  the effects of IGF-1 abrogated in the presence of PPP, suggesting they are due to
  the recruitment of the IGF-1R tyrosine kinase pathway (E, F). The facilitatory effects
  of IGF-1 on the length and number of axons are compromised significantly in the
  presence of rapamycin suggesting the recruitment of the mTOR axis by IGF-1/IGF-1R
  signaling for axon regeneration (E and F). Experiments were carried out in triplicates
  per group. Scale bars: 100 μm (B) 50 μm (C) and 20 μm (D).'
