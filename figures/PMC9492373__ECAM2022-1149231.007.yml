caption: 'Influence of ATL-III on PERK/eIF2α/ATF4 pathway protein and mRNA expression
  levels after PERK inhibition by GSK2656157. a-d: effects of ATL-III on protein expression
  levels of p-PERK/PERK (a, b), p-eIF2α/eIF2α (a, c), ATF4 (a, d), and CHOP (a, e)
  after using PERK inhibitor GSK2656157. f-h: effects of ATL-III on mRNA levels of
  PERK (f), eIF2α (g), and ATF4 (h) after using PERK inhibitor GSK2656157. Data were
  mean ± SD; ∗∗P < 0.01 versus control group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 versus model group.'
