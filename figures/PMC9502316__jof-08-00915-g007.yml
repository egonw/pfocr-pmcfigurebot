caption: MoAde8 is related to the oxidative stress response. (A) Growth of Guy11,
  ∆Moade8, and ∆Moade8-C on CM and CM supplemented with 10 mM H2O2 for 8 d. (B) Relative
  growth rates of Guy11, ∆Moade8, and ∆Moade8-C were calculated when being exposed
  to H2O2. Asterisks are used to mark significant differences (** p < 0.01). (C) Localization
  of MoAde8-GFP in the mycelium of M. oryzae. Scale bar, 10 μm. (D) Co-localization
  between MoAde8 and peroxisomes. Epifluorescence and DIC images of ∆Moade8-C conidia
  expressing MoPTS1-mCherry were taken before and after a 4 h induction in CM liquid
  medium. Scale bar, 10 μm.
