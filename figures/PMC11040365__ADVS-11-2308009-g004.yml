caption: RECQL4 accelerates DNA damage repair in HCC after radiotherapy in vitro.
  A) GSEA of gene expression data in FDUZS cohort shows RECQL4 expression were enriched
  in DNA repair pathway and radiation response pathways. B) Representative images
  of neutral comet assay at 0, 0.5, 6, and 12 h after IR. C) Clonogenic assays and
  survival fraction curves of MHCC97H and HCCLM3 cells stably transfected with RECQL4
  or empty vector after exposure to the indicated IR dose. D,E) Immunofluorescence
  staining revealed the cellular location of γ‐H2AX (D) and dsDNA (E) at 10 h after
  exposure to 6 Gy IR. F) Western blotting detects γ‐H2AX at different time points
  after RT in MHCC97H cells treated with control or RECQLE‐overexpression, or HCCLM3
  cells treated with shNC or shRECQL4. Scale bar, 10 µm. Data are presented as mean
  ± sd.
