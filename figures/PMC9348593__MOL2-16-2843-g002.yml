caption: PGAM1 downregulates ASS1 expression through cAMP/AMPK/CEBPB axis. (A, B)
  KEGG analysis of PGAM1‐related downstream pathways. (C, D) The cAMP levels in the
  cell supernatants of the BC cell lines were detected by ELISA (n = 3). (E, F) The
  protein levels of AMPK, pAMPK, CEBPB, and pCEBPB measured by western blot (n = 3).
  (G) The JASPAR database was used for forecasting the binding sites of CEBPB in the
  ASS1 promoter. (H, I) The ChIP assays were conducted to verify the actual binding
  site in BC cells (n = 3). (Data was analyzed by t‐test, and was shown as mean ± SD.
  **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.).
