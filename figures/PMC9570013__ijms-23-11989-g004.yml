caption: GGCT is highly expressed in PTC. (A) Representative images of GGCT immunohistochemistry
  (IHC) of normal PTC tissue (left) and PTC tissue (right) (scar bar = 100 µm). (B)
  Statistics of GGCT immunohistochemical score of PTC group (n = 26) and normal group
  (n = 26) (Each dot represents a patient’s normal thyroid tissue, and each triangle
  represents a patient’s PTC tissue). (C) Correlation analysis of GGCT and MRPL9 IHC
  scores. (D) Representative Western blot of GGCT protein in 26 pairs of PTC tissues
  and normal tissues. (E) Western blot results were quantified and normalized to Actin
  (n = 3). (F) RT-qPCR analysis detected the expression level of GGCT in Nthy-ori
  3.1, TPC-1, K1, BCPAP cell lines (n = 3). (G) Western blot detection of GGCT protein
  expression levels in Nthy-ori 3.1, TPC-1, K1, and BCPAP cell lines. (H) Western
  blot results were quantified and normalized to Actin (n = 3). Measurement data (mean
  ± standard deviation) between two groups were compared by paired t test, and multiple
  groups were compared by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s post hoc
  test. “*” represents p ≤ 0.05, “**” represents p ≤ 0.01.
