caption: DSF/Cu induced ER stress in meningioma cells. The bar chart shows potential
  upstream regulators predicted with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis based on microarray
  data from MgACs treated for 6 h (a) or 24 h (b) with DSF and 1 μM CuCl2. Shown are
  upstream regulators for which there was at least a 1.3-fold change in expression
  compared to vector control cells. (c) Cells were incubated for 24 h with 0.1 μM
  DSF and 1 μM CuCl2 alone or in combination, after which expression of proteins related
  to the unfolded protein response was confirmed by Western blotting. Thapsigargin
  (Tg) is an inducer of the ER stress and served as a positive control; α-actinin
  served as a loading control. The quantitative data normalized with internal control
  are labeled below each protein band. The bar chart shows potential canonical pathways
  predicted with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis based on microarray data from MgACs treated
  for 6 h (d) or 24 h (e) with DSF and 1 μM CuCl2. Shown are upstream regulators for
  which there was at least a 1.0-fold change in expression compared to vector control
  cells. (f) Cells were incubated for 24 h with 0.1 μM DSF and 1 μM CuCl2 alone or
