caption: 'Trimetazidine (TMZ) regulates the nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor
  2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway and resists oxidative stress reaction induced by palmitate
  (PA). PA, skeletal muscle cells treated with palmitate; siNC, treated with negative
  control small interfering RNA; siNrf2, treated with Nrf2 small interfering RNA;
  TMZ, skeletal muscle cells treated with TMZ. (A, B) Nrf2 protein expression was
  determined by western blot. (C, D) DCF: DCFH-DA (2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
  diacetate), dihydroethidium (DHE) were detected for reactive oxygen species. *,**Represented
  p<0.05, p<0.01 in comparison with siNC group, respectively; #, ##represented p<0.05,
  p<0.01 in comparison with PA+siNC group, respectively; @,@@represented p<0.05, p<0.01
  in comparison with PA+TMZ+siNC group, respectively. GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase.'
