figure_title: PARD6A knockdown suppresses EMT of ovarian cancer cells in vitro and
  in vivo
caption: A Protein levels of PAR6α in ovarian cancer cell lines (SKOV3, HO8910, OVCAR8
  and A2780) and normal ovarian surface epithelial cell line HOSEpiC. Above cells
  were collected and protein lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with the
  PAR6α antibody. B Densitometric analysis of the immunoblots (A) was conducted using
  ImageJ to quantify PAR6α levels relative to β-actin in ovarian cancer cell lines.
  Representative pictures and statistical analysis of wound-healing assays on SKOV3
  (C) and A2780 cells (D), which were silenced with siPARD6As, at the indicated time.
  Scale bar = 500 µm. Representative pictures of transwell migration and invasion
  assays and statistical analysis of transwell migration and invasion assays on SKOV3
  (E) and A2780 cells (F) silenced by siPARD6As. Scale bar = 200 µm. G Representative
  images of lung metastases of ovarian cancer cells in mice. H Statistics of volumes
  of lungs of each group of mice at the indicated time. I Pulmonary nodules of each
  group of mice. J Representative images of H&E staining of paraffin sections of mouse
  lung tissues in each group. Scale bar = 100 µm (×100) and scale bar = 50 µm (×400).
  K Immunohistochemical detection of HLA class1 ABC in mouse lung tissues. Data are
  expressed as the H-Score, considering both staining intensity and the percentage
  of positively staining cells. Scale bar = 100 µm (×100) and scale bar = 50 µm (×400).
  Data shown in this figure are the mean values (±SD) from three independent experiments.
  Statistically significant differences with P < 0.05 were considered significant
  (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001).
