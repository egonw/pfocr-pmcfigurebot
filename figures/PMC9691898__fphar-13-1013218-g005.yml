caption: AMPK regulated the effect of metformin on TG synthesis via the XBP1-mediated
  DGAT2 pathway. (A) p-AMPK (Thr172) and total AMPK protein (t-AMPK) levels of mice
  fed control diet, HFD, or HFD with or without metformin treatment for 5 weeks; n
  = 6–8. (B) p-AMPK and t-AMPK levels in HepG2 cells treated with 2 mmol/L or 5 mmol/L
  metformin for 24 h. (C) Relative levels of XBP1 and DGAT2 mRNA in HepG2 cells transfected
  with dominant negative (DN)-AMPKα1 plasmid or pc-DNA empty vector for 48 h. Data
  are presented as the mean ± SEM. ∗p < 0.05 compared with control cell, respectively.
  (D) Immunofluorescence images of XBP1 and DGAT2 protein in HepG2 cells transfected
  with DN-AMPKα1 plasmid in the presence or absence of metformin for 48 h (E) DGAT2
  protein levels in HepG2 cells transfected with DN-AMPKα1plasmid in the presence
  or absence of metformin for 48 h (F) DGAT2 protein levels in HepG2 cells co-transfected
  with DN-AMPKα1 plasmid or recombinant adenovirus expressing XBP1 (Ad XBP1) in the
  presence or absence of metformin for 48 h. These experiments were repeated at least
  three times. Representative blots of independent experiments are shown. GAPDH was
  used as a loading control.
