caption: Knockdown of CHML/Rep2 decreases, whereas overexpression increases, mTOR
  activation. (A) Immunoblot analysis of phosphorylated mTOR (S2448), mTOR, phosphorylated
  S6K (S371), S6K, phosphorylated S6 (S235/236), and S6 protein levels in A549 cells
  treated with 5 nm NT or CHML/Rep2 siRNA for 72 h., then amino acid starved for 30 min.,
  and left untreated or treated for 15 min. with 1 mm l‐arginine (R) to activate the
  mTOR pathway. (B) Endogenous immunofluorescence of mTOR (red) colocalization with
  LAMP1‐positive lysosomes (green) following knockdown and l‐arginine treatment same
  as (A). Scale bar = 10 μm. (C) Immunoblot analysis of the same proteins assessed
  in (A) in A549 WT cells transfected with 1 µg of either empty vector or WT‐CHML
  for 24 h, then amino acid starved for 30 min., and left untreated or treated for
  15 min. with 1 mm l‐arginine (R). (D) Endogenous immunofluorescence of mTOR (red)
  colocalization with LAMP1‐positive lysosomes (green) following Rep2 overexpression
  and l‐arginine treatment same as (C). Scale bar = 10 μm. All groups for immunoblot
  and immunofluorescence analysis were performed in triplicate, and experiments were
  repeated two times to ensure validity of results. (E) RT‐PCR of mTOR, S6KB, S6,
  and CHML mRNA levels following Rep2 knockdown (72 h) or overexpression (24 h). Data = mean ± SD.
  n = 3 per group. *P < 0.05 compared to NT siRNA or EV group. Unpaired student’s
  t‐test. (F) SILAC determination of protein synthesis following knockdown with CHML/Rep2
  siRNA and treatment with heavy arginine or heavy lysine for 24 h. Data = mean ± SD.
  n = 6 per group. *P < 0.05 compared to NT siRNA group. (G) Immunoblot analysis of
  mTOR pathway proteins in A549 WT vs. NRF2 KO cells treated with Rep2 siRNA or transfected
  with a WT‐CHML plasmid as described above. All groups for immunoblot analysis were
  performed in triplicate, and experiments were repeated two times to ensure validity
  of results.
