caption: MiR-181a-5p was predicted as an applicant miRNA that affected the development
  of ESCC by targeting MAP2K1 (MEK1). (A) The top 300 DEGs determined from GSE161533,
  GSE17351, GSE75241 and GSE67269 datasets; (Bâ€“E) The heat map depicted the top 100
  DEGs from GSE161533, GSE17351, GSE75241 and GSE67269 datasets; (F) The heat map
  depicted the top 100 DEMs from GSE114110 (G) the expression of MAP2K1 in ESCC in
  the GSE67269 dataset; (H) the expression of MAP2K1 in ESCC in the GSE45670 dataset;
  (I) the expression of miR-181a in ESCC in the GSE114110 dataset; (J) the top 100
  miRNAs predicted from TargetScan, miRDB, and starBase. (K) miR-181a-5p was found
  had targeted binding regions with MAP2K1 (MEK1).
