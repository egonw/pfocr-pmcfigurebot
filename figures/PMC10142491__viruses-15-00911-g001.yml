caption: 'KEGG pathway of the pyrimidine metabolism, annotated with C. variabilis
  NC64A and PBCV-1 genes. From genomic analyses of C. variabilis NC64A and the Chlorovirus
  PBCV-1, functional annotations of genes were mapped onto a KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes) flow chart for pyrimidine metabolism. The chart indicates
  the (i) name of a metabolite, with the position indicated by “o”, (ii) enzyme function
  responsible for a metabolite conversion (annotated by the Enzyme Commission (E.C.)
  number), (iii) flux direction, indicated by a connecting arrow, and (iv) associated
  metabolic pathways that feed into or out of the pyrimidine metabolism pathway. Where
  the C. variabilis gene was identified, the E.C. number was color-coded green. Where
  the PBCV-1 homologous gene was identified, the E. C. number was color-coded red.
  If both the C. variabilis NC64A and PBCV-1 homologous gene was identified, the E.
  C. number was color-coded green and red. If no gene was identified, the E. C. number
  was left uncoded and appears as a white box. The information for the genomic analyses
  of the virus and host cell are found in , and the lists of genes used for the KEGG
  Mapper to the Pyrimidine Metabolism Pathway are found in . (A) Ribonucleoside-diphosphate
  reductase (E.C.1.17.4.1): augmenting enzyme of both purine and pyrimidine metabolism
  pathways. (B) Cytosine deaminase (E.C.3.5.4.1): complementing enzyme of pyrimidine
  metabolism. (C) Aspartate/ornithine carbamoyltransferase (E.C.2.1.3.2): complementing
  enzyme of the pyrimidine metabolism that is not sensitive to nucleotide feedback
  regulations. (D) dUTP pyrophosphatase (E.C.3.6.1.23): augmenting enzyme of the pyrimidine
  metabolism. (E) Deoxynucleoside kinase (E.C.2.7.4.14): augmenting enzyme of pyrimidine
  metabolism but not purine metabolism. (F) dCMP deaminase (E.C.3.5.4.12): augmenting
  enzyme of pyrimidine metabolism that is sensitive to dCTP positive feedback and
  dTTP negative feedback. (G) dCTP deaminase (E.C.3.5.4.13): complementing enzyme
  of pyrimidine metabolism that is sensitive to dTTP as a negative feedback. (H) Thymidylate
  synthase X (E.C.2.1.1.148): complementing enzyme of pyrimidine metabolism that may
  override the host-encoded ThyA; ThyX is FADH2-dependent.'
