caption: Ectopic ADAMTS16 expression promotes GC cell invasion and migration via the
  NF-κΒ/IFI27 axis. (A) Heat map analysis showed altered genes in AGS-vector and AGS-ADAMTS16
  cells. (B) Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect
  IFI27 mRNA expression in stably ADAMTS16-expressing cell lines. (C) Gene set enrichment
  analysis showed enrichment of ADAMTS16-associated genes in the HALLMARK_TNF_SIGNALING–VIA_NFKB
  pathway. (D) Western blot and quantitation of phospho-IκBα, IκBα, phospho-P65, P65,
  and IFI27 in stably transfected GC cell lines. (E) Western blot and quantitation
  were performed to analyze the expression of IFI27 in stably transfected HGC27 and
  AGS cells treated with or without 10 μM BAY11-7082 (NF-κB inhibitor) for 24 h. (F)
  Western blot and quantitation showed that ADAMTS16 overexpression promoted the phosphorylation
  of P65 in the nucleus. (G,H) Co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that ADAMTS16
  interacted with IκBα in HGC27 and AGS. (I) Immunofluorescence assays revealed that
  ADAMTS16 was co-localized with IκBα in HGC27 and AGS cell cytoplasm. (J) Schematic
  representation of IFI27 promoter organization and the corresponding luciferase reporter
  constructs pGL3-IFI27-WT, Mut1, and Mut2. Transcriptional start site, E1 exon1,
  and Luc luciferase. The blue and red bars indicate the binding sites of P65, including
  original and mutated sequences. (K) Dual-luciferase reporter assays were performed
  to analyze the activity of the pGL3-IFI27-WT, Mut1, and Mut2 constructs in HGC27
  and AGS cells. Scale bar, 50 µm. The data are shown as means ± standard deviations.
