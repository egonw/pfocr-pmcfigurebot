caption: 'Knockout of GSDMD reduces pancreatic necrosis, systemic inflammation and
  oxidative stress in acute pancreatitis. (ai) The experimental schedule. (aii–aiv)
  The levels of amylase (aii), lipase (aiii) and LDH (aiv) in serum were detected
  (n = 5). (av) The levels of IL-1β in pancreas tissues were detected (n = 5). (b)
  The expression of GSDMD in GSDMD wild-type or GSDMD-/- C57BL/6 mice was detected
  by PCR. (ci–civ) Representative H&E images and histopathological scores of the pancreas
  in L-arginine-acute pancreatitis (n = 5). Scale bars, 100 μm. (di,dii,ei,eii,fi,fii)
  Representative immunofluorescence staining of TXNIP, HIF-1α, p-IRE-1α (red) and
  DAPI (dark blue) in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded of mice pancreas tissues (n
  = 5). Scale bars, 100 μm. (gi–gv) The expressions of TXNIP, HIF-1α, REDD1 and p−P−65
  were analyzed by Western blot in pancreas tissues (n = 5). All values were shown
  as the mean ± SEM. # p < 0.05 compared with WT mice control group, Δp < 0.05 vs.
  GSDMD-/- mice control group, &p < 0.05, &&p < 0.01, &&&p < 0.001, &&&&p < 0.0001
  compared with WT mice acute pancreatitis model groups, %p < 0.05, %%p < 0.01, %%%p
  < 0.001, %%%%p < 0.0001 compared with WT mice acute pancreatitis model groups. Unpaired
  Student’s t-tests were used in (aii–av,cii–civ,dii,eii,fii,gii–gv). KO represents
  GSDMD knockout mice, WT represents GSDMD wild type mice.'
