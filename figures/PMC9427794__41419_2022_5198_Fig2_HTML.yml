figure_title: The promoting effect of GASP1 on the growth of breast cancer cells
caption: a Stable expression of GASP1 in MDA-MB-231 and DU4475 cells was confirmed
  by qRT-PCR and western blot assays. β-actin was used to normalize GASP1 expression.
  GAPDH and β-actin were used as the loading controls. b MTT showing the effect of
  GASP1 overexpression on the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 and DU4475 cells. c The
  effect of GASP1 overexpression on colony formation ability of MDA-MB-231 and DU4475
  cells. Quantitative analysis of colony numbers is shown in the right panel. d GASP1
  knockout by CRISPR-Cas9 technology was validated by western blot analysis. e, f
  GASP1 knockout in HCC1937 and MCF7 cells significantly inhibited cell growth and
  colony formation. g Xenograft tumor growth curves of GASP1 knockout MCF7 cells and
  control cells in nude mice (n = 6/group). h Images of the indicated xenograft tumors
  and statistical analysis of tumor weight. i The levels of Ki-67 proteins in the
  xenograft tumors by IHC assay (left panels). Statistical analysis of the percentage
  of Ki-67-positive cells was shown in the right panels. Scale bars, 200 µm. Data
  were presented as mean ± SD. **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
