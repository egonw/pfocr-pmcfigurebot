caption: TGFB2-AS1 suppresses TGFβ2 signaling in TNBC cells. (A) Schematic view of
  SMARCA4 occupancy around TGFB2-AS1 and TGFB2 genomic locus from ChIP-seq in MDA-231
  cells with knockdown of TGFB2-AS1. Blue indicates siNC group and pink indicates
  siB2-AS1 group. H3K4Me3 and H3K27Ac histone mark were displayed on four cell lines
  from ENCODE, on the layered H3K4Me3 and the layered H3K27Ac tracks respectively.
  Each color represents one cell line. (B) ChIP-qPCR shows the binding efficiency
  of SMARCA4 to the TGFB2 promoter region using three primers in MDA-231 cells transfected
  siAS1. (C and D) ChIP-qPCR shows the H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac levels of the TGFB2 promoter
  region using three primers in MDA-231 cells transfected siAS1. Error bars represent
  mean ± SD (n = 3). (E) GSEA of microarray profiles from MDA-231 with TGFB2-AS1 knockdown
  matching with TGFβ activated gene set. (F) Heat-map representation of up-regulated
  genes relating TGFβ signaling pathway in TGFB2-AS1 knockdown group comparing control
  group from IPA. RT-PCR and Western blot assay show TGFB2 mRNA and protein expression
  in MDA-231 cells after transfected with two TGFB2-AS1 siRNAs (G) and LM2 cells overexpressed
  TGFB2-AS1 (H). Western blot analysis shows P-SMAD2/3 and P-SMAD1/5 protein levels
  after treated with CM collected from MDA-231 cells after TGFB2-AS1 knockdown (I)
  or LM2 cells TGFB2-AS1 overexpression (J), and SMAD1/5, SMAD2/3, and β-actin work
  as internal control. Error bars represent mean ± SD (n = 3). Statistical significance
  was assessed using two-tailed Student’s t test. ***P < 0.001.
