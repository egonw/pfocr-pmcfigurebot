caption: The cell cycle and the expression of related proteins were detected by flow
  cytometry, CCK8, qRT-PCR and Western blot. It further indicates that circDiaph3
  inhibits pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (PASMC) proliferation via ˆIgf1r and
  PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. A Flow cytometry-based detection of PASMC apoptosis.
  B CCK8 assay for detecting PASMC proliferation. C qRT-PCR analysis of circDiaph3,
  α-SMA, Vcam1, Igf1r, PI3K, Akt, and mTOR in PASMCs. D PASMC cycle analysis performed
  by flow cytometry. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD); *compared
  with the control group, p < 0.05
article_title: CircDiaph3 influences PASMC apoptosis by regulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
  through IGF1R.
