caption: NET1 may be involved in cardiac fibrosis through β-catenin(A) Cardiac fibroblasts
  were transfected with si-β-catenin and NC, and the protein level of β-catenin was
  detected by western blot. n = 5,∗p = 0.0175 si-β-catenin1 vs. NC, ∗p = 0.0327 si-β-catenin2
  vs. NC by Kruskal-Wallis test.(B and C) Fibrosis marker protein FN-1 (n = 4, ∗∗p
  = 0.0011 NET1 + si-β-catenin vs. NET1 by Kruskal-Wallis test) and (C) collagen I
  expression was detected by western blot. n = 4, ∗∗p = 0.0075 NET1 vs. Ctrl, ∗p =
  0.0259 NET1 + si-β-catenin vs. NET1 by Kruskal-Wallis test.(D) MTT method was used
  for detection of fibroblast viability. n = 7, ∗∗p = 0.0093 Ctrl vs. NET1, ∗∗p =
  0.0063 NET1 + si-β-catenin vs. NET1 by Kruskal-Wallis test.(E) Fibroblast migration
  ability was detected by cell scratch method. n = 4, ∗p = 0.0166 Ctrl vs. NET1, ∗∗p
  = 0.0003 NET1 + si-β-catenin vs. NET1 by Kruskal-Wallis test. For all statistical
  plots, the data are presented as mean ± SEM.(F) Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) was
  performed to verify GSK3β protein interaction with NET1 and β-catenin.
