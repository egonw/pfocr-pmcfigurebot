caption: Overexpression of OsiWAK1 partially rescued the premature PCD in ospdt1.
  A–C, Anthers were obtained from the WT at Stages 8a, 8b, and 9, respectively. D–F,
  Anthers were obtained from the WI at Stages 8a, 8b, and 9, respectively. G–I, Anthers
  were obtained from the WEO at Stages 8a, 8b, and 9, respectively. J–L, Anthers were
  obtained from the ospdt1/WEO at Stages 8a, 8b, and 9, respectively. Dy, dyad cell;
  Msp, microspore; pdt1/WEO, OsiWAK1-eYFP overexpressing line in the ospdt1 background;
