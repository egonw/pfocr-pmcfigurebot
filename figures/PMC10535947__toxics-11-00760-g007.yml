caption: 'DHM can regulate the Nrf2/HO-1 signalling pathway and attenuate apoptosis
  to exert protective effects. (A) Protein expression of Nrf2, HO-1, Keap1, Cleaved-caspase-3,
  Caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2 was analysed using western blot analysis. (B) Relative
  protein expression was quantified by ImageJ analysis. All data are expressed as
  mean ± standard deviation (n = 3). # represents a statistically significant difference
  compared to the control group, * represents a statistically significant difference
  compared to the AFB1 group. ## p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.'
