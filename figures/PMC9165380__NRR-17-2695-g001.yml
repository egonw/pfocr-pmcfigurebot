caption: 'The newly discovered functions of RECS1 in the regulation of lysosomal calcium
  and cell death.(A) Lysosomes are membrane-enclosed cytosolic organelles, functioning
  as the main intracellular catabolic compartment. In the lysosomal lumen, biomolecules
  are degraded by hydrolase enzymes that function at very acidic pH (~4.5). Under
  stress conditions, LMP leads to the cytosolic translocation of lysosomal enzymes
  causing cell death. Lysosomes are also intracellular calcium reservoirs. Lysosomal
  calcium signaling is mediated by at least three different families of calcium channels
  and is essential for many processes, including lysosomal fusion with different organelles
  and the induction of the autophagic pathway. (B) RECS1 overexpression or starvation
  results in decreased lysosomal pH and increased intraluminal calcium concentration,
  leading to imbalances in lysosomal calcium homeostasis. Abnormal calcium signaling
  is involved in the etiology of many diseases, including lysosomal storage disorders,
  neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. RECS1 overexpression sensitizes cells to
  various chemotherapeutic drugs, including the lysosomotropic agents CQ and HCQ.
  The treatment of RECS1 overexpressing cells with these drugs correlates with BAX
  translocation to the lysosomal membrane and LMP, leading to lysosomal-dependent
  cell death. Lysosomal membrane damage also results in autophagy inhibition, which
  under certain conditions, can lead to cell death. BAX: Bcl-2-associated X protein;
  CQ: chloroquine; HCQ: hydroxychloroquine; LMP: lysosomal membrane permeabilization;
  P2X4: trimeric Ca2+ two-transmembrane channel; RECS1: responsive to centrifugal
  force and shear stress 1; TPC: two-pore channel; TRPML1: transient receptor potential
  channels of the mucolipin family 1.'
