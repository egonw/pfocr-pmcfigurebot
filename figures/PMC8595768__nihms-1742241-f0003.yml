figure_title: Oxidative stress-induced damage of IDE and BVR-A is associated with
  development of brain insulin resistance
caption: Mitochondria impairment results in increased levels of ROS/RNS that are able
  to damage proteins and lipids within cells. In particular, increased 3-NT modifications
  of BVR-A occur in AD brain and are responsible for reduced BVR-A activation and
  scaffold protein function. Such events result in the hyper-activation of IRS1 upstream
  in the pathway and in reduced activation of Akt downstream from IRS1. Moreover,
  the oxidative modification of BVR-A results in reduced ability for BVR-A to favor
  the AMPK-mediated inhibition of mTOR. As consequence, the hyper-activation of mTOR
  occurs and is responsible for the inhibition of IRS1 and thus the development of
  brain insulin resistance. Likewise, ROS/RNS elevation leads to the nitrosylation
  and consequent inhibition of IDE causing this enzyme not to contribute to Aβ degradation.
  In turn, increased Aβ levels lead to IR downregulation thereby reducing the pool
  of IR available at the plasma membrane to bind insulin. In parallel, increased Aβ
  levels further contribute to mitochondrial damage and increased ROS/RNS production.
  Arrows represent stimulation; lines represent inhibition. See text for more details.
