figure_title: The unfolded protein response (UPR) and ER stress are at the crossroads
  of neuronal cell survival and cell death
caption: 'Early N-linked glycan biosynthesis is a central mediator of the UPR pathway.
  The UPR leads to protein refolding or salvage and activation of pro-survival pathways
  in neurons. However, if accumulation of unfolded proteins or prolonged stress exceeds
  capacity, the UPR leads to ER stress that triggers mitochondrial apoptotic signaling
  cascades and neuronal cell death. The UPR and pro-survival pathways (Left): Accumulation
  of misfolded proteins recruits available GRP78 and sequesters GRP78 away from ER
  membrane signaling transducers: ATF6, PERK, and IRE1. Binding of GRP78 to misfolded
  glycoproteins leads to protein refolding or salvage through lysosomal and proteasomal
  degradation. Dissociation of GRP78 with ATF6, PERK, and IRE1 also leads to their
  activation and subsequent signaling cascades for epigenetic remodeling of neurons.
  This process promotes neuronal cell survival by upregulating genes involved in the
  autophagy, lysosomal processing, metabolism, and N-linked glycosylation as a protective
  process against cellular stress. ER stress occurs when misfolded proteins or stress
  exceeds the UPR capacity (Right): If the UPR fails to re-establish cellular homeostasis,
  excess utilization and depletion of GSH and production of H2O2 during the refolding
  process leads to the ectopic release of Ca2+ and H2O2 from the ER into the cytosol.
  Excess of either cytosolic Ca2+ and H2O2 initiates mitochondrial-driven pro-apoptotic
  pathways including release of Cytochrome C and Caspase 3/7 activation and signaling
  cascade, ultimately inducing neuronal cell death.'
