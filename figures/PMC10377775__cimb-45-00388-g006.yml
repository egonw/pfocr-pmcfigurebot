caption: MHJ-627 paradoxically upregulated the expression and phosphorylation of ERK5,
  possibly due to the stimulatory crosstalk of the ERK1/2 pathway. (a) Western blot
  image depicting the elevations in ERK5 protein expression and phosphorylation. Effect
  of MHJ-627 on the protein expression and phosphorylation of ERK5 was measured via
  Western blot analysis after HeLa cells were treated with compounds for 24 h; (b)
  quantitation of Western blot showing a paradoxical increase in ERK5 expression;
  (c) quantitation of Western blot showing a trend of increase in ERK5 phosphorylation;
  (d) the increase in ERK5 expression and phosphorylation was due to the compensatory
  action of ERK1/2. GAPDH was used as a loading control. Relative protein expression
  of the 0 μM control was set as 1. Western blot data were quantified using ImageJ
  software. Data are presented as mean ± SD. Each experiment was performed in duplicate
  and repeated at least three times. One-way ANOVA (* p < 0.05) was used for significance.
  All values were compared to the 0 μM control value to determine the significance.
