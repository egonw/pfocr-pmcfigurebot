caption: KSHV RTA induces the polyubiquitination and degradation of ID2 through the
  ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. (A) Immunoblot detection of 3xFLAG-RTA and ID2 in
  Dox-induced iBJAB-3xFLAG-RTA cells. (B) RT-qPCR analysis of ID2 transcript abundance
  in iBJAB-3xFLAG-RTA cells. t tests were performed between 0 h postinduction (hpi)
  and 24 or 48 hpi (ns, not significant). (C) Immunoblot analysis of lenti-GFP and
  lenti-ID2-transduced iSLK cells expressing Dox-inducible RTA. (D) Western blot analysis
  of HeLa cells cotransfected with ID2 and either vector control or an increasing
  amount of 3xFLAG-RTA. (E) Immunoblot detection of 3xFLAG-RTA and ID2 in 293T cells
  that were cotransfected with ID2 and either vector control or increasing amounts
  of 3xFLAG-RTA. (F) RT-qPCR analysis of ID2 in the experiment performed in panel
  E when control vector or the largest amount of RTA was cotransfected with ID2. (G)
  Western blot analysis of 293T cells that were cotransfected with ID2 and vector
  or 3xFLAG-RTA, and treated with DMSO (control) or 40 Î¼M MG132. (H) FLAG immunoprecipitation
  was performed using 293T cells that were cotransfected with ID2-3xFLAG and either
  a vector control or Myc/His-tagged RTA (M/H-RTA). FLAG IP was subjected to ubiquitin
  Western blotting. (I) 293T cells were cotransfected with HA-ubiquitin, ID2-3xFLAG,
  and Myc/His-RTA (M/H-RTA). After FLAG immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed, the
  IP samples were subjected to immunoblot analysis.
