figure_title: miR-596-3p was explored as a downregulated gene in NSCLC tissues by
  integrative analysis
caption: A High level of miR-596-3p was detected in the circulation of healthy donors
  (n = 30) compared to the patients with early stage of NSCLC (n = 30). B The expression
  of miR-596-3p was examined by RT-qPCR for Beas-2B, A549, H460, PC9, H1915, PC9-BrM
  and H1915-BrM cells. C GO analysis were performed to detect the function of miR-596-3p
  in cell processes. D Enriched KEGG pathway analysis of miR-596-3p associated genes
  by DAVID. E The target genes of miR-596-3p were selected from the top 60 genes predicted
  by StarBase V2.0 database followed by GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) between
  patients with or without brain metastasis in GSE11969 dataset. F Inter-relations
  of gene expression levels. The gene expression values were conducted to separate
  different categories for their interrelationship. For this, hierarchical cluster
  dendrogram was explored using Ward Minimum Variance Method. (In the heatmap, the
  red color shows a strong positive expression correlation while blue color depicts
  weak expression correlation while the rest color codes fall in between). Data were
  presented as the means ± standard error of the mean of at least three independent
  experiments. *P < 0.05 and ***P < 0.001.
