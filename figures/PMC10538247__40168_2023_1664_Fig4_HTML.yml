caption: Transcriptomic analyses of the inbred and outbred populations. A Volcano
  map, the horizontal coordinate indicates the change in the gene expression (inbred
  vs. outbred population) (log2 fold change); the vertical coordinate indicates the
  significance level (-log10 (P-value)). The upregulated genes and downregulated genes
  are presented by red and green dots, respectively. Grey represents no significant
  difference. B The GO functions of significantly different genes were enriched in
  the outbred population of B. dorsalis. MF stands for molecular function, BP for
  biological processes and CC for cell components. C Significantly downregulated gene
  expression in outbred populations. D Intestinal transcriptome metabolic pathway
  map
article_title: Population mixing mediates the intestinal flora composition and facilitates
  invasiveness in a globally invasive fruit fly.
