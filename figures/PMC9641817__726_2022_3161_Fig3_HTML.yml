caption: Gut microbiota-derived tryptophan metabolites regulate vascular physiology
  and disease. Dietary Trp can be converted into various metabolites by the gut microbiota.
  Indoxyl sulfate induces oxidative stress and inhibits wound healing of the endothelium.
  Tryptamine initiates the production of serotonin from enterochromaffin cells. Local
  effects of serotonin include the degranulation of neutrophils, which exacerbates
  thromboinflammation. Indoxyl sulfate and indole may regulate blood pressure via
  the serotonin signaling pathway, which acts either through central or peripheral
  mechanisms. Anti-inflammatory effects are evoked via IPA and lAld following ILâ€‘10
  production, or via IAA and tryptamine resulting in a decreased release of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines from macrophages. Blood pressure is regulated by a variety of AHR ligands
  that influence intestinal immune cells. Dysbalance of AHR ligands such as IAA or
  ILA can act on ILCs or TH17 cells to alter the blood pressure and promote hypertension.
  Abbreviations IAA indole-3-acetic acid, AHR aryl hydrocarbon receptor, ILA indole-3-lactic
  acid, IPA indole-3-propionic acid, IAld indole-3-aldehyde, ILC innate lymphoid cell,
