caption: Different drug sensitivities in suspended cells and adherent cells. H69A
  cells and H69S cells were treated with different concentrations of (A) cisplatin
  (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 8 and 10 µg/ml), (B) etoposide (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 8,
  12 and 16 µg/ml), (C) anlotinib (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4 and 6 µg/ml), (D) CS2164
  (0, 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6 and 10 µg/ml) and (E) RAD001 (0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 20
  µg/ml) for 48 h. Cell viability was tested using Alamar Blue reagent. All experiments
  were repeated three times. *P<0.05, vs. adherent group.
