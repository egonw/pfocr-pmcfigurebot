caption: Schematic representation of the main alterations that occur during the course
  of retinitis pigmentosa that may have a direct implication in sight restoration
  via retinal prosthesis. (I) As the disease progresses, an important remodeling takes
  place in the retina that alters the neural circuitry. These modifications entail
  an important degradation of the processing and transmission functions of the retina,
  which eventually communicates abnormal information to the brain. (A) In the photoreceptor
  layer, rods die but cones can be still present. (B) Deafferented ON rod bipolar
  cells are now connected to the nearest cone available. (C) A general function shift
  occurs among the bipolar cells. ON-type bipolar cells become OFF-type, thus increasing
  the OFF-to-ON bipolar cells ratio. (D) Some cells that lose their synaptic connections
  tend to establish new connections with adjacent cells, thus forming neural tangles
  that deliver nonphysiologic information to RGCs and promote their activation. (E)
  RGCs modify their dendritic arbors, establishing new connections with bipolar cells.
  (F) A sectorial loss of RGCs causes a decrease in the amount of neural targets available
  for electrical stimulation. (G) RGCs display spontaneous activity as a consequence
  of an electrically coupled network established between AII amacrine and ON cone
  bipolar cells. (II) Retinal degeneration alters the entire visual pathway, including
  visual processing centers in the brain. Spontaneous activity of the visual cortex,
  quantitative alterations in neurotransmitters and neurotrophins affecting plastic
  dynamics, conversion of visual cortex neurons to process information from a different
  sensory modality, and cortical remapping are some of the changes described in the
  brain as a result of retinal degeneration.
