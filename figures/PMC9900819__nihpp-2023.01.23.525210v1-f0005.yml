figure_title: Co-administration of BI-3406 with adagrasib leads to regressions in
  KRASG12Ci-resistant colorectal cancer (CRC) models
caption: 'a, Tumor growth into the KRASG12C-mutant CRC xenograft model (SW847) treated
  with vehicle (red) or adagrasib (blue; 50 mg/kg, 5 days on/2days off per week).
  N=30 per group (n=10).b, Outgrowing adagrasib-resistant tumors from (a) that had
  shown an increase in size at least of 100mm3, were treated with adagrasib (50 mg/kg,
  qd, p.o.), adagrasib (50 mg/kg, qd, p.o.) plus BI-3406 (50mg/kg, bid, p.o.), adagrasib
  (50 mg/kg, qd., p.o.) plus cetuximab (20mg/kg, twice weekly, i.p.), or adagrasib
  (50 mg/kg, qd) plus TNO155 (10mg/kg, bid). N=5 tumors/group. Mean ± SEM are shown.
  Data were analyzed on Day 31 by an one-sided non-parametric Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon
  U-tests adjusted for multiple comparisons according to the Bonferroni-Holm Method
  within each subtopic; ada = adagrasib; n.s. = non-significant. c, Modulation of
  overall MAPK pathway activity, as indicated by the MAPK Pathway Activity Score (MPAS),
  in tumors derived from SW837 xenograft models. Tumors were collected from models
  before adagrasib treatment (pre-treatment) and during relapse as well as from adagrasib-resistant
  models treated with adagrasib plus BI-3406 or cetuximab. N=3–16/group. Boxplots
  show low and upper quartiles and median line is indicates. Whiskers: 1.5 x interquartile
  range. Data analyzed by two-sided Wilcoxon ran sum test. d, Volcano plot of differentially
  regulated genes between pre-adagrasib treatment (pre-treatment) and relapsed SW837
  tumors. The most significantly differential genes involved in MAPK pathway are highlighted.
  e, Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) plots show downregulated pathways between
  tumors collected from SW837 models prior to adagrasib treatment and during relapse
  after chronic adagrasib treatment. EMT = epithelial-mesenchymal transition. NES
  = normalized enrichment score; FDR = false discovery rate-adjusted q value.'
