caption: Tryptophan action in the intestine. In the intestine, the microbiota influences
  tryptophan metabolism by (1) conversion of tryptophan into indole derivates; several
  of these derivates are ligands to AhRs, which regulate immune homeostasis, epithelial
  function, and modulate xenobiotic, antioxidant and hormone‐like estrogen metabolism—AhRs
  are also involved in prevention colonization by pathogens; (2) the kynurenine pathway
  in immune and epithelial cells via IDO‐1 induction, which has neurotransmission
  activity. Kynurenic derivates can be neuroprotective or neurotoxic; (3) serotonin
  (5‐HT) production in enterochromaffin cells via the induction of tryptophan hydroxylase
  1 (Tph‐1), leading to an increase in intestinal motility, intestine‐brain signaling,
  nutrient absorption, and vasodilatation
