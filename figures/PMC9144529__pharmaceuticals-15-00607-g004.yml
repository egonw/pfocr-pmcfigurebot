caption: Axonal degenerative mechanisms via the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  (NAD+) signalling pathway and sterile alpha- and T1R-motif containing 1 (SARM1)
  activation. Damage or insults to axons decreases the availability of nicotinamide
  mononucleotide adenyltransferase 2 (NMNAT2) at terminal nerve endings due to decreased
  axonal transport and high turnover rates. The increase in nicotinamide mononucleotide
  (NMN) and/or decrease in NAD+ triggers SARM1 activation, the executor of axonal
  degeneration through downstream pathways including calcium influx and the mitogen-activated
  kinase (MAPK) pathways. Other precursors of NAD+ or forms of vitamin B3 have also
  been implicated including nicotinamide riboside (metabolised into NMN by nicotinamide
  riboside kinase (NRK)) and nicotinic acid riboside (metabolised into nicotinic acid
  mononucleotide (NAMN) by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT)).
