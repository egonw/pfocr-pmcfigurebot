caption: mRNA ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) diseases and functions analysis. A
  bar chart displaying the top-20 significant diseases and biological function categories
  using the short versus long disease duration differentially expressed mRNA gene
  list (A). An upset plot comparing the number of overlapping genes expressed across
  the top-5 significant disease and biological function categories (a. Cancer, b.
  Organismal Injury and Abnormalities, c. Endocrine System Disorders, d. Reproductive
  System Disease, e. Cell Cycle) (B). Sample size n = 20 long, n = 22 short. This
