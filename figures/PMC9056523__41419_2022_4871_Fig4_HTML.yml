figure_title: MEX3A interacts with SCIN in NPC cells
caption: A Heatmap of DEGs identified by hierarchical clustering analysis of RNA-sequencing
  data of shCtrl (n = 3) and shMEX3A (n = 3) stable C666-1 cells. B Volcano plot of
  DEGs between shCtrl and shMEX3A stable C666-1 cells. C Classic pathway enrichment
  analysis revealed that MEX3A was associated with interferon and chemokine signaling.
  D Ingenuity pathway analysis-based interaction network of MEX3A and signaling pathways,
  including the interferon, chemokine, NF-κB, ERK/MAPK signaling pathways. E, F The
  expression levels of major downstream factors associated with MEX3A were determined
  by RT-qPCR (E) and western blotting (F) in C666-1 cells. G The impact of depletion
  of main downstream genes associated with MEX3A, including SCIN, CCL2, LMNB1, and
  MYD88, on the proliferation of C666-1 cells was determined by Celigo-based cell
  counting assay. H, I The interaction between MEX3A and SCIN in C666-1 cells (H)
  and HONE-1 cells (I) was determined by endogenous co-immunoprecipitation. *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
