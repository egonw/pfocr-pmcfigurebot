caption: Comparison of Drosophila and human Jak/STAT and RNAi signalling cascades.
  Basic diagram of Jak-STAT signalling in Drosophila versus humans (top). Likewise,
  simplified diagrams of RNAi signalling in Drosophila versus RNAi and RIG-like receptor
  (RLR) signalling in humans (bottom). Homologies between fly and human signalling
  proteins are shown through similar colour and shape. A detailed description of each
  pathway and its key proteins is included in the main text. Note that not all known
  signalling proteins and adaptors are included in the diagram for the sake of simplicity.
