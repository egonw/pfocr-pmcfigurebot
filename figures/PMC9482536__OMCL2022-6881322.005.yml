caption: PARP-1-dependent autophagy. The massive synthesis of PAR (PARylation) by
  the overactivation of PARP-1 leads to NAD+ and ATP depletion and significant increases
  in intracellular AMP, which remarkably activates autophagy through the interaction
  between the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR) signaling pathways. In addition, sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) may be the signal hub
  between PARP-1 and the mTOR signaling pathway.
