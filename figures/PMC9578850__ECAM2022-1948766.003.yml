caption: Probe the axis of gene action in GBM. (a) Protein interactions between genes
  found by STRING. (b) Predicted binding site to HDAC2 on DNMT3B promoter obtained.
  (c) ChIP experiment to verify the relationship between HDAC2 and DNMT3B. (d) Raw
  letter analysis to obtain the CpG island of the Bcl2 promoter. (e) ChIP experiment
  to verify the enrichment of DNMT3B HDAC2-DNMT3B-Bcl2 expression correlates in glioma.
article_title: HDAC2 Induces DNA Methyltransferase DNMT3B Expression to Regulate the
  Wnt Signaling Pathway and Thus Promotes Glioma Development and Progression.
