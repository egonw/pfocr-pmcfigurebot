caption: Wnt signaling is involved in DVB formation(A) Bar plot showing the penetrance
  of “no DVB” defect in mutants of the Wnt pathway. oxIs12 transgene was used for
  all except bar-1 mutant, which is on the same chromosome. n, total L4 larvae scored.
  See also  and . Mean and standard deviation between biological replicates of the
  percentage of worms scored are represented. ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001;
  ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001, and ns, not significant.(B) Fluorescence microscopy pictures of
  a double mutant lin-44(n1792); egl-20(n585) L4 worm in which DVB appears to be formed
  from K anterior daughter. gaIs245 highlights the rectal cells’ nuclei and oxIs12
  the GABAergic neurons including DVB. Anterior is left and ventral is bottom.(C)
  Representation of the percentages of the indicated phenotypes in lin-44(n1792) single
  and lin-44(n1792); egl-20(n585) double mutants shown in (A). When present, DVB is
  formed mostly by K.a in the double mutant strain. n, total animals scored.
