caption: 'Liver metabolic profiles in WT and hMTH1‐Tg mice as a function of diet and
  age. (a) The mean values of single metabolites measured in 2‐month‐old animals maintained
  on the standard diet (SD) or high‐fat diet (HFD) are represented as hMTH1‐Tg:WT
  ratios. Metabolites belonging to common metabolic pathways are grouped in boxes.
  (b) As in panel A for 7‐month‐old animals. The absolute quantification of m‐Ins
  (at 4.01 ppm in proton NMR spectra) was not reported due to the presence of other
  signals overlapping in the same spectral interval. The indicated metabolites were
  analysed in the liver of 3–7 animals per group. Abbreviations grouped for metabolic
  pathway: (a) glucose metabolism: D‐glucose (Glc) and lactic acid (Lac); (b) nucleotide
  metabolism: adenosine monophosphate (AMP) + adenosine diphosphate (ADP) + adenosine
  triphosphate (ATP), AXP = (AMP + ADP + ATP), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD),
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), uridine monophosphate (UMP) + uridine
  diphosphate (ADP) + uridine triphosphate (UTP), UXP = (UMP + UDP + UTP); (c) one
  carbon metabolism: formic acid (Form); (d) amino acid metabolism: L‐phenylalanine
  (Phe), L‐tyrosine (Tyr), L‐histidine (His), L‐glycine (Gly), L‐glutamic acid (Glu),
  L‐valine (Val), L‐glutamine (Gln), L‐isoleucine (Ile), L‐Aspartic acid (Asp) and
  L‐alanine (Ala); (e) redox balance metabolism: glutathione (Gs) and taurine (Tau);
  (f) lipid metabolism: glycerophosphocholine (GPC), phosphocholine (PCho), free choline
  (Cho) and ethanolamine (Etn); (g) lipid and amino acid metabolism: acetic acid (Acet);
  (h) tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle: fumaric acid (Fum) and succinic acid (Succ);
  (i) other pathways: total creatine (creatine + phosphocreatine; Creat)'
