caption: Differential expression of opioid-related genes in colon adenocarcinoma.
  Transcriptomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas Colon Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-COAD)
  database was analysed. (a) Volcano plot showing differential expression of opioid
  genes for MSI (dMMR) vs MSS (pMMR) tumours. –Log10 P-value (adjusted for multiple
  testing) is plotted against log2 (fold change). The horizontal dotted line represents
  P=0.05. Vertical lines dotted at an absolute fold change of 2. Genes with absolute
  fold change higher than 2 and P-value<0.05 are coloured blue. (b) SSGSEA analysis
  correlation plot highlighting major pathways and cell types correlated with MSI
  upregulated (Opioid∗MSI) and downregulated (Opioid∗MSS) opioid genes. For each pairwise
  correlation, the colour and the size of the circle denote the Spearman correlation.
  (c) SSGSEA correlation of MSI upregulated opioid genes and Th1 immune signature
  and (d) MSI downregulated opioid genes and Wnt beta-catenin pathway; each patient
  sample is labelled as MSI (blue) or MSS (purple) and is plotted by normalised SSGSEA
  scores for the relevant gene sets on the x- and y-axes. Shaded area represents the
  95% confidence interval around the best fit line. MSI, microsatellite instability;
  MSS, microsatellite stability; SSGSEA, single-sample gene set enrichment analysis.
