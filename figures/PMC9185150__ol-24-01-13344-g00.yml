caption: BPTF is overexpressed in T-cell lymphoma tissues. (A) BPTF expression in
  lymphoid neoplasm DLBC and normal tissues was analyzed from mRNA sequencing data
  from TCGA database. Red denotes cancer tissue, and gray denotes normal tissue. (B)
  mRNA expression levels of BPTF in cancerous lymph nodes vs. adjacent normal tissues
  from T-cell lymphoma patients, and in stage III/IV vs. stage I/II tumor tissues.
  (C) Immunohistochemistry staining of BPTF in cancerous lymph nodes or adjacent normal
  tissues from T-cell lymphoma patients. Magnification, Ã—400. (D) Western blot analysis
  of protein expression of BPTF in lymph nodes or adjacent normal tissues from T-cell
  lymphoma patients. ***P<0.001. BPTF, bromodomain PHD finger transcription factor;
  DLBC, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas.
article_title: BPTF activates the MAPK pathway through coexpression with Raf1 to promote
  proliferation of T-cell lymphoma.
