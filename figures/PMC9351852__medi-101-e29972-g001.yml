caption: THRSP mRNA expression profile. (A) THRSP gene expression in various tumors
  and adjacent normal tissues. The red box indicates THCA and thyroid gland. (B) THRSP
  gene expression in different cancer cell lines. The red box indicates THCA cell
  lines. Differential expression analysis between THCA and normal tissues in (C) GEPIA,
  and (D) Oncomine. *P < .05; **P < .01; ***P < .001 compared with normal groups.
  THCA = thyroid carcinoma, THRSP = thyroid hormone-responsive.

  carcinoma and its potential regulatory pathway.
