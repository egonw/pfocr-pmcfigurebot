caption: 'The interleukin 1 superfamily: from the cytokines and their receptors to
  their main signaling pathway. The ligand (interleukin) binds to its main receptor,
  which induces the recruitment of the co-receptor (IL-1RAP, IL-18RAP, or SIGIRR).
  The TIR intra-cellular domains of the receptor/co-receptor complex will recruit
  MyD88, which activates the MAPK signaling pathway. Finally, MAPKs induce NF-κB or
  AP-1 transcription factors. The IL-37 is the only interleukin known to activate
  another pathway, independently of MyD88, which induces the STAT3 transcription factor.
  Abbreviations: AP-1: activator protein 1; IL: interleukin; IL-1R: interleukin 1
  receptor; IL-1Ra: interleukin 1 receptor antagonist; IL-1RAP: interleukin 1 receptor
  accessory protein; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; MyD88: myeloid differentiation
  primary response 88; NF-κB: nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated
  B cells; SIGIRR: single Ig IL-1-related receptor; STAT3: signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3. Created with BioRender.com.'
