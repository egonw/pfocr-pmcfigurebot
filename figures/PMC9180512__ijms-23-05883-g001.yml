caption: P2Y-R and vascular tone. P2Y2-R (left). Endothelial Piezo1 mediates flow-induced
  ATP release through pannexin channels. Extracellular ATP then activates a signaling
  pathway that involves the P2Y2-R/PLCβ/PI3K/AKT signaling cascade, leading to phosphorylation/activation
  of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). P2Y1-R (right). Shear stress increases
  autophagy, which sequentially promotes GLUT-1 expression, cellular glucose uptake,
  ATP production via the glycolytic pathway, and ATP release into the extracellular
  medium. Extracellular ATP can be hydrolyzed to ADP by ecto-F1-ATPase anchored to
  the plasma membrane of endothelial cells. This hydrolytic activity of ecto-F1-ATPase
  is stimulated by apoA-I, which is the main HDL apolipoprotein, and the newly generated
  extracellular ADP sequentially activates P2Y1-R, PKCδ or PI3Kβ/Akt, and eNOS. Both
  P2Y1-R- and P2Y2-R–mediated eNOS activation lead to the production of nitric oxide
  (NO), which diffuses extracellularly to promote blood vessel dilatation and a decrease
  in blood pressure.
