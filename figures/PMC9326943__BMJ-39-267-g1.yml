caption: FLOT2 expression was upregulated in CC cells. (a) RT-qPCR measured the expression
  of FLOT2. FLOT2 mRNA level was dramatically elevated in CC cells relative to HcerEpic
  cells. (b) Western blot analysis was employed to evaluate the protein level of FLOT2.
  FLOT2 protein level was dramatically elevated in CC cells relative to HcerEpic cells.
  ***P < 0.001 compared with the HcerEpic group.
