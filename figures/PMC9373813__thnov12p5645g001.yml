caption: 'The role of sclerostin and its loops in regulating the expression of inflammatory
  cytokines and chemokines in macrophages and VSMCs from Col1a2+/G610C.ApoE-/- mice,
  Wnt signaling pathway and osteogenic potential in osteoblasts from Col1a2+/G610C
  mice in vitro. (A) Schematic diagram of primary structures of full-length human
  sclerostin and sclerostin truncations. (B) The effect of full-length human sclerostin
  (FL hSOST), human sclerostin with loop3 deficiency by genetic truncation (Δloop3-hSOST),
  human sclerostin with loop2&3 deficiency by genetic truncation (Δloop2&3-hSOST),
  and human sclerostin with loop2&3 inhibition by sclerostin antibody (FL hSOST+antibody),
  respectively, on regulating mRNA expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and
  chemokines in primary macrophages from Col1a2+/G610C.ApoE-/- mice with Ang II treatment
  in vitro. (C) The effect of FL hSOST, Δloop3-hSOST, Δloop2&3-hSOST, and FL hSOST+antibody,
  respectively, on regulating mRNA expression of inflammatory chemokine in aortic
  VSMCs from Col1a2+/G610C.ApoE-/- mice with Ang II treatment in vitro. (B-C) Data
  were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. ^^P < 0.01, ^^^P < 0.005 and ^^^^P
  < 0.0001 for a comparison of PBS with AngII group by a parried t-test. * P < 0.05,
  ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.005 and **** P < 0.0001 for a comparison of AngII, Δloop3-hSOST+AngII,
  Δloop2&3-hSOST+AngII, and FL hSOST+antibody+AngII with FL hSOST +AngII by one-way
  ANOVA with Tukey''s post-hoc test. (D) The effect of FL hSOST, Δloop3-hSOST, Δloop2&3-hSOST,
  and FL hSOST+antibody, respectively, on regulating Wnt signaling and osteogenic
  potential in osteoblasts from Col1a2+/G610C mice. One-way ANOVA with Tukey''s post-hoc
  test vs. Wnt+FL hSOST group was used to determine the inter-group differences. *
  P < 0.05; ** P < 0.01; *** P < 0.005; **** P < 0.0001. Note: AngII: Angiotensin
