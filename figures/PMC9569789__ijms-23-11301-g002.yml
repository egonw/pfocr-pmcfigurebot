caption: 'Molecular regulatory models identified in plant–diazotrophic bacteria association.
  The main studies involve the recognition via 16S rRNA of the plant microbiome and
  the regulation of plant genes involved in nitrogen metabolism, phytohormone regulation,
  antioxidant metabolism, cell wall, and plant receptors involved in recognition of
  diazotrophic bacteria. Certain pathways lead to the promotion of growth and tolerance
  to biotic and abiotic stresses. Blue arrows: expression is up-regulated; Red arrows:
  expression is down-regulated; Gray arrow: flow of the pathway. ACC: 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic
