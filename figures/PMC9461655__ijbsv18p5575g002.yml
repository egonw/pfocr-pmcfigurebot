caption: 'Analysis of expression level and CGI methylation of TRPM4 in CRC cells.
  (A) Decreasing and silencing of TRPM4 in CRC cell lines due to the CGI methylation
  of its promoter, with GAPDH as controls. (B) Pharmacological demethylation with
  5-Aza and TSA recovered TRPM4 expression in methylated cell lines. Representative
  results are shown. A+T: treatment with 5-Aza and TSA. (C) Representative analysis
  of TRPM4 methylation in primary tumors (T) and corresponding noncancerous tissues
  (N) by MSP. (D) TRPM4 protein expression level in 21 paired CRC samples examined
  by Western Blot. (E) The sequence of TRPM4 promoter region, vertical lines indicate
  individual CpG sites. M methylated; U unmethylated.'
article_title: A novel methylated cation channel TRPM4 inhibited colorectal cancer
  metastasis through Ca2+/Calpain-mediated proteolysis of FAK and suppression of PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  signaling pathway.
