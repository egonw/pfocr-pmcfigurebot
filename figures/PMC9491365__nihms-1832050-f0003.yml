caption: A distinct cluster of high p16-expressing FAPs in old skeletal muscle exhibits
  a senescence phenotype. (a) A UMAP plot of FAPs from 3 young and 3 old female mice
  reveals four distinct clusters. (b) The FAPs marker gene Pdgfra is distributed across
  all clusters, but senescence-related genes p16, p15, and Spp1 are enriched in cluster
  3. (c) Heatmap of scRNA-seq-derived marker genes for the four FAP subclusters, with
  several labels for several senescence-related genes enriched in cluster 3. (d) KEGG
  pathway enrichment analysis of cluster 3 specific genes using GSEA. Top enriched
  pathways were selected for plotting. (e) GSEA enrichment plot of the chemokine signaling
  pathway in FAPs cluster 3.
