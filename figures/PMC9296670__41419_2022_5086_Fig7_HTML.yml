figure_title: The HIC1-TGFB1-CXCL5 loop is associated with disease progression in
  patients with PCa
caption: 'a Representative IHC images of TMA showing the corresponding expression
  of stromal CD206 and CXCL5 in PCa tumor tissues. Scale bar: 200 (upper panel) and
  50 μm (lower panel). b Analysis of a number of CD206 staining cells in stroma between
  normal and tumor, stage I–II and stage III–IV tissues. c Analysis of CXCL5 staining
  in stroma between normal and tumor, stage I–II and stage III–IV tissues (P values
  were obtained using two-tailed Student’s t tests. The Whiskers connect the minimum
  and the maximum values to the Box; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001).
  d The correlation between CD206+ cells and CXCL5 expression levels in stroma. Spearman
  r = 0.541. The correlation was calculated by Spearman correlation analysis. e IHC
  staining of stromal CD206 in primary tumor and metastatic lymph nodes from the same
  patient. Black arrows represent M2 macrophages. Lower panel: quantitative analysis
  of infiltrating macrophages in primary tumor compared with infiltrating macrophages
  in metastatic LNs. P values were obtained using two-way ANOVA. Scale bar: 200 (upper
  panel) and 50 μm (lower panel). f Schematic model shows how HIC1-mediated crosstalk
  between cancer cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts promotes in the process of PCa
  progression. Conditional deletion of Hic1 and Pten in mouse prostate epithelium
  contributes to the malignant phenotype of PCa. HIC1-induced higher TGF-β secretion
  in TME promotes M2 macrophage activation and up-regulates CXCR4 expression by inducing
  c-Myc pathway. Meanwhile, TGF-β activates NFs into CAFs to secrete higher CXCL12,
  which binds to CXCR4 on M2 macrophages. Upon the interaction with CAFs, M2 macrophages
  in turn enhance the malignant phenotypes of PCa through induction of EMT by activating
  the CXCL5/CXCR2 chemokine axis.'
