caption: The differentially accumulated metabolites in response to ethylene. (A,B)
  are volcano plots and clustering heat map of differentially accumulated metabolites.
  The metabolite content data were normalized. PR-C2H4 and PR-H2O represent the primordia
  of G. lucidum treated with ethylene and water, respectively. (C)The most significant
  7 KEGG pathways. KEGG is a pathway-related database, and pathway enrichment analysis
  identifies significantly enriched pathway in differentially accumulated metabolites,
  and hypergeometric test is used test the statistical significance of the enrichment
  of differentially accumulated metabolites in KEGG pathways. The red and blue dashed
  lines indicate p-value < 0.01 and p-value < 0.05, respectively.
