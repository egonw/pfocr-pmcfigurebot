caption: RTK/Ras/PI3K/AKT pathway was strongly related to immune functions in glioma.
  (A) GO analysis showed that RTK/Ras/PI3K/AKT pathway was involved in immune response
  and inflammatory response. (B) Volcano plot display differentially expressed cytokines
  and chemokines according to RTK/Ras/PI3K/AKT signaling. Heat maps display the association
  between RTK/Ras/PI3K/AKT pathway, and most correlated gene expression in the immune
  response (C) and inflammatory response (D).
article_title: Alterations in the RTK/Ras/PI3K/AKT pathway serve as potential biomarkers
  for immunotherapy outcome of diffuse gliomas.
