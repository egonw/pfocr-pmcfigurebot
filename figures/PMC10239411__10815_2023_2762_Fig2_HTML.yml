caption: 'Downregulated INHBB in RIF patients. a Volcano plots of DEGs compared with
  RIF and control women (change > two fold, adjusted P value < 0.05) (n = 3 vs 3).
  b Transcriptome levels (FPKM) of INHBB. c IHC staining of INHBB in the endometria
  of control fertile (CTL) and RIF patients. P1, P2, and P3 indicate three different
  women. Scale bar = 100 μm. S, stroma; GE, glandular epithelium. d The mean IOD of
  INHBB of the epithelial part. IOD, integrated optical values, analysed by Image-Pro
  Plus 6. NS: no statistical difference. e The mean IOD of INHBB of the stromal part.
  *P < 0.05. f The relative mRNA expression of INHBB was quantified using RT-qPCR.
  Expression levels are shown relative to 18S rRNA; CTL (n = 18) and RIF (n = 10).
  **P < 0.01. g The protein levels of INHBB in CTL and RIF were assessed using western
  blotting. h The relative protein levels of INHBB were quantified. CTL (n = 12) and
  RIF (n = 12). *P < 0.05'
