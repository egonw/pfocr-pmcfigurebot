figure_title: Schematics for the formation of scaffold-free cardiac organoids integrated
  with gold nanoribbons. (A) Seed-mediated growth method for the fabrication of AuNRs.
  (B) Isogenic differentiation of hiPSC-CMs and hiPSC-CFs through the regulation of
  the Wnt signaling pathway and fibroblast growth factor stimulation. Spontaneous
  beating was observed in the hiPSC-CMs. Vimentin and TE-7 staining was used for the
  confirmation of the differentiation of hiPSC-CFs. (C) Formation of cardiac organoids
  by seeding hiPSC-derived cardiac cells and AuNRs in agarose microwells. The cardiac
  organoids were formed by the integration of hiPSC-CMs, hiPSC-CFs (7 : 3 respectively),
  and AuNRs (10 μg mL−1). Diameter reduction and spontaneous beating were observed
  on day seven after seeding
