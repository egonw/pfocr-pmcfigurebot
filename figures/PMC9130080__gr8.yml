caption: Effect of TCS on the expression of tau protein in Neuro-2a cells. The cells
  were treated with DMSO (control) and TCS (10, 30 and 50 µM) for 24 h. (a) Bar graph
  illustrating RT-qPCR analysis for the relative quantification of tau gene transcription.
  (b) Representative expression pattern of tau and p-tau proteins as determined by
  immunoblot analysis. β-Actin was used as internal control in all analyses. The respective
  bar graphs in (a) and (b) represents the fold change in expression as compared to
  control cells in respective genes or proteins, respectively. Results are representative
  of three independent experiments with mean ± SEM. * indicates p < 0.05 as compared
  to control cells in respective genes or proteins. TCS, triclosan.
