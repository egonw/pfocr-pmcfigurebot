caption: The expression changes, highly correlated genes for PTK7 and KEGG pathway
  enrichment for the highly correlated genes of PTK7.(A) The expression of PTK7 was
  consistently over-expressed in several ESCC datasets. The red background indicates
  significant over-expression of the gene. (B) A part of the interactive heatmap for
  co-expressed genes with PTK7. The green cells show the expression intensity, the
  last two columns show PCCs with PTK7 in the current dataset, and the average PCCs
  across 13 preprocessed datasets. (C) The KEGG pathway enrichment plot. The cell
  cycle is one of the enriched pathways.
