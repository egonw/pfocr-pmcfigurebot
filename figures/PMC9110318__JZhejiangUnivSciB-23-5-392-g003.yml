figure_title: 'Evaluation of mRNA and protein levels of genes involved in antibody
  production in the spleens with FK228 treatment in vivo. (a) The mRNA levels of Prdm1,
  Xbp1, Irf4, and Aicda, in the spleens of skin-transplanted mice (syngeneic, allogeneic,
  and FK228-treated groups) were determined by RT-qPCR, and the target genes were
  normalized to the corresponding GAPDH. (b) The western blot analyses of AID, Blimp-1,
  IRE1α, p-IRE1α, and XBP1 in the spleens of skin-transplanted mice (syngeneic, allogeneic,
  and FK228-treated groups), with β‍-actin as a loading control. All data are shown
  as mean±standard deviation (SD), and are representative of three separate experiments.
  * P<0.05, ** P<0.01. mRNA: messenger RNA; Aicda: activation-induced cytidine deaminase;
  Xbp1: X-box-binding protein 1; Prdm1: positive regulatory domain-containing 1; Irf4:
  interferon regulatory factor 4; RT-qPCR: quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase
  chain reaction; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; AID: protein encoded
  by Aicda; Blimp-1: B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1; IRE1α: inositol-requiring
  enzyme 1 α; p-IRE1α: phosphorylated IRE1α; NS: not significant'
