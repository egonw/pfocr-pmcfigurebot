caption: aPC regulates metabolic pathways and oxidoreductase activity in DKD. (a)
  Volcano plot showing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in APChigh-DM mice compared
  with WT-DM mice. Example genes related to metabolism and inflammatory pathways are
  shown in red (bold). (b) KEGG pathway analysis of renal (induced) DEGs enriched
  by DAVID in APChigh-DM mice compared to WT-DM mice. The bar plot shows the enrichment
  scores (-log [p value]) of the significantly enriched KEGG pathways. (c) KEGG pathway
  analysis of metabolism-related DEGs enriched by DAVID in APChigh-DM mice compared
  to WT-DM mice. The bar plot shows the enrichment scores (âˆ’log [p value]) of the
  significantly enriched KEGG pathways.
