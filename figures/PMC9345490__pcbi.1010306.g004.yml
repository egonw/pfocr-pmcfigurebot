figure_title: Stochastic influence on lateral inhibition and multicell pattern formation
caption: (a) Pseudopotential landscape for the multicell model in the absence of noise
  (σshot = 0) for a single independent simulation. X- and y-coordinates represent
  cellular levels of Notch and Delta, respectively. Green starred dots depict the
  location of the landscape minima corresponding to S and R states, while black starred
  dots depict the location of the S and R states in a perfect checkerboard pattern.
  (b) Same as (a) but for σshot = 10. (c) Same as (a) but for σshot = 20. Panels (a)-(c)
  show that shot noise maintains separation of the Sender and Receiver states even
  as the system explores the state space. (d) The percentage of correct contacts (i.e.,
  Sender-Receiver) as a function of white noise for random initial conditions (orange).
  (e) Same as (d) but for correct contacts as a function of shot noise. The lattice
  is influenced towards a more ordered system for intermediate levels of noise. For
  panels (d) and(e), results are averaged over 20 independent simulations of 9000
  hr using random initial conditions after a 1000 hr relaxation period. For initially
  checkerboard systems, 20 independent simulations of 4000 hr are averaged after allowing
  for 1000 hr of relaxation.
