figure_title: Identification of downstream cell proliferation-related mRNAs of caprin-1
caption: A The mRNAs that may bind to caprin-1 was identified by RIP sequencing, followed
  by GO enrichment analysis. B KEGG pathway enrichment was performed to analyze the
  top 20 pathways of these cell proliferation-related mRNAs selected from GO enrichment
  analysis. C The effects of caprin-1 knockdown and circIPO7 overexpression on the
  phosphorylation of Akt were analyzed by western blot. The group of overexpressing
  circIPO7 without 277-37 fragment (defined as circIPO7-delete in all figures) was
  also used as negative control. D RIP assay was used to verify the interaction between
  caprin-1 and selected mRNAs (EGFR, cyclin D1, IRS1, PDGFRA and mTOR) obtained from
  RIP sequencing. E The effects of caprin-1 knockdown and circIPO7 or circIPO7-delete
  overexpression on the protein level of above 5 molecules were analyzed by western
  blot. F Pearson correlation analysis between the expression levels between EGFR,
  mTOR with caprin-1 (n = 124). G Pearson correlation analysis between the expression
  levels between EGFR, mTOR with circIPO7 (n = 124). ****p < 0.0001.
