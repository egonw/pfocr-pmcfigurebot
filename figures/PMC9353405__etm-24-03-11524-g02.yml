caption: ADSCs delay the progression of Sjögren's syndrome by upregulating the Hippo
  signaling pathway. (A) Western blotting analysis showed that the protein expression
  levels of TAZ in the ADSC group and Control group decreased gradually between 13
  and 17 weeks, and that the downward trend of TAZ in the ADSC group was slower compared
  with the Control group. (B) Immunofluorescence staining showed that the expression
  of E-cad (green) in SMGs from mice in the ADSC group was significantly higher compared
  with that in the Control group. DAPI (blue) was used to stain the nucleus. (C) Immunofluorescence
  showed that the expression of TAZ in SMGs of ADSC group was significantly higher
  than that of the Control group. DAPI (blue) was used to stain the nucleus. *P<0.05,
  **P<0.01. ADSCs, adipose-derived stem cells; E-cad, E-cadherin; SMG, submandibular
  gland; TAZ, transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif.
