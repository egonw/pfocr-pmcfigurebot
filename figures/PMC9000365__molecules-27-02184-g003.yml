caption: Adenosine modulated the mRNA expression of cell proliferation and cell cycle
  related genes in human dermal papilla cells. The mRNA expression level of cell proliferation
  marker (Ki67) and cell cycle arresters (CDKN1A and CDKN2A) was evaluated in hDPCs
  by RT-PCR after adenosine treatment for 24 h. Minoxidil was used as a positive control.
  The data represent the means of five independent samples. MNX, minoxidil; N.T, non-treated
  control; Significantly different compared with N.T (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, ***
  p < 0.001).
