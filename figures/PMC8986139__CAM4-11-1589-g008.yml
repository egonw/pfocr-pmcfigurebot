caption: miR‐516a‐5p is sponged by RNASEH1‐AS1. (A) The subcellular localization of
  RNASEH1‐AS1 predicted by LncATLAS. (B, C) The subcellular location of RNASEH1‐AS1
  in NSCLC cells. (D, E) Expression profiles of miR‐218‐5p and miR‐516a‐5p in LUAD
  and LUSC tissues were determined utilizing the TCGA database. (F) The expression
  of miR‐218‐5p and miR‐516a‐5p was examined in RNASEH1‐AS1‐knockdown or RNASEH1‐AS1‐overexpressing
  NSCLC cells. (G) MiR‐516a‐5p expression in NSCLC. (H) The relationship between miR‐516a‐5p
  and RNASEH1‐AS1 levels in NSCLC tissues. (I)The wt and mut binding sequences between
  RNASEH1‐AS1 and miR‐516a‐5p. (J) The luciferase activity of RNASEH1‐AS1‐wt or RNASEH1‐AS1‐mut
  in miR‐516a‐5p‐overexpressing NSCLC cells. (K) RIP experiment corroborated the interaction
  between RNASEH1‐AS1 and miR‐516a‐5p. **p<0.01
article_title: Long noncoding RNASEH1‐AS1 exacerbates the progression of non‐small
  cell lung cancer by acting as a ceRNA to regulate microRNA‐516a‐5p/FOXK1 and thereby
  activating the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway.
