caption: Ursolic acid relieves renal function damage and renal tissue pathological
  damage after unilateral ureteral obstruction in rats. (a) The changes in blood urea
  nitrogen levels of rats in each group on the 8th day after surgery (mean ± standard
  deviation, n = 6); (b) the changes in blood creatinine levels of rats in each group
  on the 8th day after surgery (mean ± standard deviation, n = 6); (c) special staining
  of rat kidney tissue with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining solution. On the 8th day
  after operation, after HE staining, the pathological damage of rat kidney tissue;
  ∗means P < 0.05; ∗∗means P < 0.01; ∗∗∗means P < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗means P < 0.0001.
