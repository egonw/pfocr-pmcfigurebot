caption: 'Effect of G-6 and GEM on proliferation of pancreatic cells. (A) Chemical
  structure of G-6 and GEM. (B) G-6 (40 μM), GEM (5 μM), respectively or combined
  in SW1990, CFPAC-1, Capan-2, and PANC-1 cells for 72 h, and the cell viability was
  detected by MTT. (C) Living and dead cells were observed with Calcein/PI co-staining.
  Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 compared with the
  control; # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, ns indicates not statistically significant, G-6
  + GEM compared with GEM. Scale bar = 100 µm.'
