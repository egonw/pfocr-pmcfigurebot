caption: Reactome FI networks between differentially expressed genes belonging to
  the “defense response to other organism”, “defense response”, “defense response
  to virus”, “cytokine secretion”, “cytokine production” and “cytokine-mediated signaling
  pathway” GO BP terms. “--->”, activating/catalyzing; “-|”, inhibition; “-“, FIs
  extracted from complexes or inputs; “---”, predicted FIs. (A) Reactome FI network
  for the cytokine-mediated signaling pathway. (B) Reactome FI network for the interferon-gamma-mediated
  signaling pathway. (C) Reactome FI network for the inflammatory response. (D) Reactome
  FI network for the innate immune response. (E) Reactome FI network for the immune
  response. (F) Reactome FI network for the Type I interferon signaling pathway. (G)
  Reactome FI network for the defense response to virus.
