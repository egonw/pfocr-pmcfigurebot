caption: 'Effect of inhibitors of ERK1/2, JNK1/2/3 and p38 on the migration and viability
  of HCCLM3 cells. HCCLM3 cells were pre-treated with the ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126,
  the JNK1/2/3 inhibitor SP600125 or/and the p38 inhibitor SB203580 for 60 min, and
  then cell migration and viability upon Con A treatment were detected. (A) Microscopic
  images of HCCLM3 cells in a Transwell chamber (scale bar, 100 nm). (B) The quantification
  of HCCLM3 cells in a Transwell chamber was performed by counting the number of cells.
  **P<0.01 vs. the control group; #P<0.05 and ##P<0.01 vs. the Con A group. (C) HCCLM3
  cell viability. **P<0.01 vs. the control group. The data were expressed as the mean
  ± SD (n=6). Con A, concanavalin A (10 µg/ml).'

  F-actin redistribution and assembly via MAPK signaling pathway.
