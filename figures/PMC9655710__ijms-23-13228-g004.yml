caption: 'Changes in JAK/STAT pathway-related molecules in IFN-treated PBMCs after
  treatment with hMSCs or ruxolitinib. (A,B) Western blotting and (C,D) relative fold
  changes show that IFN treatment increase the levels of phosphorylated JAK1, JAK2,
  and JAK3 and STAT1, STAT2, and STAT3. Activated signaling of JAK/STAT pathway by
  IFN was remarkably suppressed by hMSC treatment at similar levels as those by ruxolitinib.
  The bands indicate serial protein expression levels up to 72 h after ruxolitinib
  treatments. The data represent the means ± SEM, n = 3, statistically significant
  at * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 compared to the control and # p <
  0.05, ## p < 0.01, and ### p < 0.001 compared with the IFN-γ-treated group.'
