caption: 'The JAK/STAT signaling pathway in atopic dermatitis. Cytokine binding to
  each receptor triggers the activation of respective JAKs, leading to phosphorylation
  of STATs and subsequent dimerization, translocation into the nucleus and regulation
  of gene transcription. IL: interleukin; JAK: janus kinase; STAT: signal transducer
  and activation of transcription.'
