caption: CNS-mediated mechanisms of cancer cachexia. Anorexia and excessive peripheral
  catabolism originate in part by tumor-induced and inflammatory changes in specific
  regions of the hypothalamus and brainstem. Cytokines (eg, IL1, TNFα) exert a profound
  inflammatory effect on the hypothalamus resulting in activation of anorexigenic
  neurons (ie, POMC) and inhibition of orexigenic neurons (ie, NPY). NPY neurons stimulate
  food intake in response to a variety of mediators including ghrelin. Ghrelin is
  a multifaceted gut hormone which activates the growth hormone secretagogue receptor
  (GHS-R). Ghrelin’s hallmark functions are its stimulatory effects on food intake,
  fat deposition, and growth hormone release. POMC neurons inhibit food intake by
  the production of α-MSH, a neuropeptide of the melanocortin family, which acts via
  type 4 melanocortin receptors (MC4R) in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Small
  molecular weight, orally active agonists of GHS-R, and antagonists of MC4R have
  been developed for the indication of anorexia/cancer cachexia. Growth differentiation
  factor (GDF15) is overexpressed by some cancers and inhibits food intake by activating
  the GFRAL-RET signaling pathway in the brainstem area postrema and nucleus tractus
  solitarii. Advanced stage cancers may be associated with persistent non–chemotherapy-related
  nausea, and clinical management of these symptoms with antiemetic regimens is recommended
  to enable food intake. High-dose corticosteroids activate NPY neurons and inhibit
  POMC neurons; however, this is limited as a therapeutic approach because of secondary
  toxicity including muscle atrophy, poor glycemic control, and thrombosis. AGRP,
  agouti-related peptide; GDF15, growth differentiation factor 15; IL1, interleukin-1;
  NPY, neuropeptide Y; POMC, pro-opiomelanocortin; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α;
  α-MSH, α-melanocyte–stimulating hormone.
