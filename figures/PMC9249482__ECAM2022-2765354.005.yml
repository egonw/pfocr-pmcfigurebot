caption: 'LTD4 inhibited the viability of type II AEC cells, but BA reversed the inhibitory
  effect: (a) type II AEC cell viability decreased with increasing LTD4 concentration
  and (b) type II AEC cell viability increased with increasing BA concentration. Compared
  with the control or 0 μg/mL group, ▲P < 0.05 and ▲▲P < 0.01. Data are expressed
  as the mean ± SD (n = 5) and were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey analysis.'
