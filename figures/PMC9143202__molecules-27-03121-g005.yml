caption: HG induced Notch3 and mTOR signaling pathways in MDBK cells. MDBK cells were
  treated with 5.5, 10.5, 15.5, and 25.5 mM glucose for 24 h, respectively; MDBK cells
  were treated with 25.5 mM glucose for 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h, respectively. Western
  blot, and qRT-PCR were used to assess protein expression, and gene expression, respectively.
  (A,B) The protein level of Notch3, mTOR, and p-mTOR; (C) The mRNA expression level
  of Notch3 and mTOR. * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 compared with control group.
