caption: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) promoted K63‐linked ubiquitination of TRAF6. (A,
  B) To determine the TRAF6‐mediated ubiquitination type, TRAF6 constructs were transfected
  into colorectal cancer (CRC) cells with various ubiquitin plasmids. Ubiquitinated
  TRAF6 was detected with the anti‐HA antibody from immunoprecipitated TRAF6 protein.
  (C, D) To confirm the effect of LPS on TRAF6 ubiquitination, CRC cells were transiently
  co‐transfected with pcDNA3.1–3×flag‐TRAF6 and HA‐K63 as indicated. At 36 h post‐transfection,
  the cells were incubated with LPS for 12 h and then subjected to ubiquitination
  assay and western blot. Data are shown as mean ±SD. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01
