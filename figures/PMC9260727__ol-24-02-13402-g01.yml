caption: 'TCF7L2-interacting region in the 3′-flanking region may play a role as an
  enhancer. (A) Schematic representation of the ENCODE ChIP-seq data of TCF7L2 (ENCSR000EUV),
  H3K4me1 (ENCSR161MXP), and H3K27ac (ENCSR000EUT) in HCT116 cells. (B) Reporter activity
  of putative enhancer regions in the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions. HCT116 cells were
  transfected with pGL4.23 (Empty vector control), pGL4.23-MOSPD1-5′E (MOSPD1-5′E),
  or pGL4.23-MOSPD1-3′E (MOSPD1-3′E) plasmids, in combination with pRL-null reporter
  plasmids for the normalization of transfection. The cells were co-transfected with
  pCAGGS-dnTCF7L2 plasmids expressing a dominant-negative form of TCF7L2 or the empty
  plasmids (Mock). Relative luciferase activities represent mean ± SD from three independent
  cultures. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA, followed by
  Turkey''s test; **P<0.01, as compared with Mock; #P<0.05, ##P<0.01, as compared
  with Empty vector control. (C) Effect of β-catenin siRNA on the reporter activity
  of MOSPD1-3′E in HCT116 cells. Relative luciferase activities represent mean ± SD
  from three independent cultures. Statistical significance was determined by one-way
  ANOVA, followed by Dunnett''s test; **P<0.01, as compared with siControl. TCF7L2,
