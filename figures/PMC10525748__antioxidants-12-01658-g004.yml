caption: PAK1 regulates p38MAPK/ATF2/PGC1α-axis signaling. (A–C) L6.GLUT4myc myotubes
  were pretreated with vehicle (DMSO, veh) or 25 μM IPA3 for 40 min and stimulated
  with 100 nM insulin for an additional 10 or 20 min. (A) Whole-cell lysates of L6.GLUT4myc
  myotubes were analyzed for stated proteins. Phosphorylated, p. Graphs show quantification
  of phosphorylated/total protein ratio (B,C). (D) Quantification of PGC1α gene expression
  ± PAK1 enrichment (using Ad-GFP-hPAK1) and ±p38MAPK inhibitor (SB202190) treatment
  in myotubes. For each independent experiment, control was set equal to 100% and
  other samples normalized thereto. β-Actin was used as the loading control for normalization
  of gene expression analysis. GFP, empty vector. DMSO, control treatment. Symbols
  in the bar graphs represent the number of independent cell passages used. Bars represent
  the mean ± SEM from 3–4 independent experiments. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 (one-way
  ANOVA/Bonferroni post hoc test or unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test was used
  for statistical analysis).
