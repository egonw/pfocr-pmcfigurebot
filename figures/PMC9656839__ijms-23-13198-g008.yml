caption: 'Schematic representation of the insulin/IGF1R–PI3K–AKT–mTOR signaling pathway
  and its impact on the subcellular distribution of PGAM2. The regulatory function
  of 14-3-3ζ/δ on the pathway is also included in the scheme. Arrows: green—activation;
  red—inhibition; black—translocation/targeting.'
