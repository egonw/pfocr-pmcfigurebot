caption: 'RAGE-mediated activation of JAK2/STAT3 axis regulates the cell cycle, migration
  and invasion of VSMCs. (a) Cell cycle analysis of VSMCs in different treatment groups
  by flow cytometry. (b) Cell migration of VSMCs in different treatment groups determined
  by wound-healing assay. (c) Cell invasion of VSMCs in different treatment groups
  determined by matrigel Transwell assay. The experiments were carried out in triplicate
  and representative images were presented. Note: ns = non-significant, ∗∗p < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗p < 0.001 and ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001 compared to control, #p < 0.05 compared to CML-BSA
  group, $p < 0.05 compared to CML-BSA + siRAGE group.'
