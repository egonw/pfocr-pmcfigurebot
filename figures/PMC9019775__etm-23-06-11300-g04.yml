caption: RUT promotes activation of the AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway. The protein
  expression levels of p-AMPK, p-SIRT1, AMPK and SIRT1 were detected by western blotting.
  Results are presented as the mean Â± SD. *P<0.05, ***P<0.001. AMPK, AMP-activated
  protein kinase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; p, phosphorylated; RUT, rutaecarpine; SIRT1,
  sirtuin 1; t, total.
article_title: Rutaecarpine ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced BEAS-2B cell injury
  through inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress via activation of the AMPK/SIRT1
  signaling pathway.
