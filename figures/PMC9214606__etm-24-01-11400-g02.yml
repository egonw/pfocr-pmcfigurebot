caption: 'GRWD1 knockdown promotes triple negative breast cancer cell apoptosis. (A
  and B) The apoptosis of (A) MDA-MB-231 and (B) HCC1937 cells transfected with siRNA-GRWD1
  was analyzed by TUNEL assay. (C and D) The protein expression of apoptosis-related
  proteins in (C) MDA-MB-231 and (D) HCC1937 cells transfected with siRNA-GRWD1 was
  detected by western blotting. **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs. Control group. ##P<0.01
  and ###P<0.001 vs. siRNA-NC group. GRWD1, glutamate-rich WD-repeat-containing protein
  1; siRNA, small interfering RNA; NC, negative control.'
article_title: GRWD1 affects the proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and migration
  of triple negative breast cancer through the Notch signaling pathway.
