caption: Associations between metabolites and genes in the brain tissue of offspring
  mice. Metabolic pathways were constructed from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
  Genomes (KEGG) pathway database. The black text represents metabolites. The oval
  region represents metabolic pathways, including vitamin B6 metabolism (blue), butanoate
  metabolism (green), glycolysis metabolism (yellow), pentose phosphate pathway (gray),
  and thiamine metabolism (pink). Black italic text indicates genes. The red text
  represents the metabolites detected in this work. The red and green down arrows
  indicate metabolites and genes up or down, respectively, compared to the control
  group.
