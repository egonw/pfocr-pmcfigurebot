caption: Regulatory relationship between Hippo signaling components and NF-κB/STAT.
  Regulatory effects of Relish, Dorsal, and STAT on the promoters of Hippo (A), Wts
  (B), and Yki (C) were examined by dual-luciferase reporter assay. The mRNA levels
  of Hippo (D), Wts (E), and Yki (F) in Dorsal-, Relish-, and STAT-silenced shrimp
  and those of Dorsal, Relish, and STAT in Hippo- (G), Wts- (H), and Yki-silenced
  (I) shrimp were investigated by qPCR. The gene knockdown efficiencies in vivo are
  shown in . ** p < 0.01 and n.s. p > 0.05 by two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test.
