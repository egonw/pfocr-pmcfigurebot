caption: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on the surface of immune cells, recognize pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs) or components of injured cells, referred to as damage-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs). TLR metabolic pathway leads to upregulation of nuclear
  factor-κΒ (NF-κΒ) and proinflammatory cytokine production. Inhibition of NF-κB pathway
  and consequent cytokine storm, seems to be a promising therapeutic strategy against
  deterioration of patients with moderate to severe COVID-19.
