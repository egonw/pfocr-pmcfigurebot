caption: Biological stages of wound healing. (a–d) After the wound, the inflammatory
  stage occurs, including the leakage of blood components (followed by platelet aggregation,
  blood clotting, and inflammatory process); (e) a proliferative stage of keratinocytes,
  fibroblasts, and endothelial cells; (f) and a final stage of granular tissue remodeling
  and re-epithelialization. In normal healing activity, fibroblasts act from the end
  of the inflammatory phase (24–48 h after the injury) until the completion of tissue
  re-epithelization. For that, migration occurs to the wound site, where fibroblasts
  infiltrate and proliferate []. Then, fibrin degradation occurs through the production
  of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and substitution by extracellular matrix (ECM)
  components, such as collagen I-IV, XVIII, glycoproteins, proteoglycans, laminin,
  thrombospondin, and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) []. This newly constituted matrix
  provides support and regulates fibroblast migration and activity, as well as produces
  signaling molecules for the onset of angiogenesis, formation of granulation tissue,
  and re-epithelialization [].
