caption: Mutational characteristics of MBC. (A) Top 10 mutated genes according to
  VAF. (B) Mutual exclusivity and co-occurrence among multiple mutations. Green and
  magenta dots represented co-occurrence and mutual exclusivity, respectively. The
  degree of significance is represented by color intensity. (C) Enrichment of known
  oncogenic signaling pathways. The X-axis represents the total number of genes in
  the pathway, and the Y-axis represents the number of affected genes in the pathway.
  (D) A total of 16 druggable genes were identified and classified into 20 targetable
  categories based on Drug Gene Interaction database. The X-axis represents the number
  of genes. MBC, metastatic breast cancer; VAF, Variant Allele Frequency.
