caption: Chemogenetic inhibition of striatal iMSNs triggers dyskinetic attacks in
  PNKD mice. A2a-Cre mice were injected in the DLS with AAV5-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry
  or AAV5-DIO-mCherry. A–E, Mice were also injected with AAV5-DIO-ChR2-eYFP. A, Representative
  coronal sections showing expression of hM4D(Gi)-mCherry (left), ChR2-eYFP (middle),
  and merged (right) in the DLS. B–E, Whole-cell recordings of MSNs (B,C) and GPe
  (D) neurons. Recording configurations are schematized at left in each panel. B,
  Representative current-clamp recording from an eYFP-positive striatal neuron (putative
  iMSN), showing a light-evoked action potential in response to a 5 ms pulse of blue
  light. C, D, Representative voltage-clamp recordings from an eYFP-negative MSN (C)
  or GPe neuron (D), showing light-evoked IPSCs before (black) and after (purple)
  application of CNO. E, Left, Summary of IPSC amplitude in the DLS and GPe after
  CNO application. Right, Resting Vm of iMSNs before and after CNO application. F,
  Schematic diagram showing bilateral injection of virus encoding hM4D-mCherry or
  mCherry, and postmortem tissue showing expression. G, Behavioral session timeline.
  H, I, Dyskinesia scores of WT mice treated with saline (H, left) or CNO (H, right),
  PNKD mice treated with saline (I, left), or CNO (I, right). Data are mean ± SEM.
  Scale bar, 1 mm.
