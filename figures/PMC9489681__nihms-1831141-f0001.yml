figure_title: The self-assembly process, antitumor immune responses, and endocytotic
  pathway evaluation of Camptothesome
caption: (a) Camptothesome formed by Sphingomyelin (SM), SM-CSS-CPT conjugate[], DSPE-PEG2K
  and cholesterol. (b) The antitumor immunity triggered by Camptothesome through eliciting
  immunogenic cell death (ICD). (c,d) The effects of endocytotic inhibitors on the
  cellular uptake of Cy5.5-labeled Camptothesome in CT26 cells through measuring the
  Cy5.5 intensity using flow cytometry. CT26 cells were pretreated with various endocytotic
  inhibitors for 0.5 h then incubated with Cy5.5/Camptothesome (50 μg CPT/mL) in the
  presence of the inhibitors for additional 2 h. (c) Representative flow cytometry
  histograms of Cy5.5/Camptothesome. (d) Cellular uptake percentage rate of Cy5.5/Camptothesome
  analyzed by flow cytometry. Data in d is expressed as mean ± s.d. (n = 3). Statistical
  significance was determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons
  test. ****P < 0.0001 vs 5% Dextrose.
