  CRPC
caption: 'A. Representative pictures of organoids in which either β-Catenin or PAK1
  was knocked out with CRISPR.B. Xenograft tumors generated from human organoids MSK-PCa1
  from SCID mice receiving combinational treatment with p110β and PAK1 inhibitors
  (AZD6482+IPA3) showed smaller sizes than those from groups receiving the individual
  inhibitors (AZD6482 or IPA3), or vehicle control (CON).C. Statistical analysis showed
  tumor weights were significantly decreased when tumor-bearing SCID mice received
  combinational drug (AZD6482+IPA3) treatment compared to those with either individual
  inhibitor treatment alone, or vehicle control.D. Representative xenograft tumors
  from SCID mice receiving combinational treatment with p110β and β-Catenin inhibitors
  (AZD6482+TNKS656) showed smaller sizes than those from groups receiving individual
  inhibitor treatment (AZD6482 or TNKS656), or vehicle control (CON).E. Tumor weights
  from tumor-bearing SCID mice receiving combinational treatment with β-Catenin and
  p110β inhibitors (AZD6482+TNKS656) were significantly decreased compared to those
  from mice receiving either vehicle control (CON), or single drug treatment (AZD6482
  or TNKS656). Human PTEN-null CRPC tumors were generated with MSK-PCa1 organoid tumor
  fragments via subcutaneous implantation in recipient SCID mice. Tumor numbers: CON:
  n=9, TNKS656: n=9, AZD6482: n=11, AZD6482+TNKS656: n=13.F. H&E staining of xenograft
  tumors sections from SCID mice receiving drug treatments or control (upper). IHC
  staining with cleaved caspase 3 antibody showed that the numbers of cleaved caspase
  3-positive cells were dramatically increased in tumor sections from tumor-bearing
  SCID mice receiving combinational drug treatment (AZD6482+IPA3) compared to those
  receiving individual drug treatment or vehicle control (lower).G and I. Statistical
  analysis of the numbers of cleaved-caspase 3-positive cells in tissue sections stained
  with cleaved-caspase 3 antibody, which were counted under a 40X objective lens.
  Over 7 tumors were counted per category.H. Representative H&E staining of tumor
  sections from tumor-bearing SCID mice receiving either drug treatments or control
  (upper). IHC staining showed the numbers of cleaved caspase3-positive cells were
  significantly enhanced in tumor sections from mice receiving combinational treatment
  (AZD6482+TNKS656) compared to those receiving single drug treatment or vehicle control
  (lower). For (F) and (H), scale bars represent 50 μm.J. Schematic model of PI3K
  pathway activation in PTEN-null CRPC progression. In the PTEN-null prostate before
  castration, the PI3K and AR pathways both contribute to the development of PIN with
  AR signaling serving to somewhat blunt PI3K signaling (left). In androgen-depleted
  conditions, AR-suppressed genes, such as PAK1, β-Catenin are overexpressed and PI3K
  signaling largely via p110β is enhanced which in turn activates the MAPK pathway
  via a RAC/PAK1 connection (right). Either p110α or p110β deletion alone affects
  CRPC tumorigenesis, while p110β has a more significant role in invasion by up-regulating
  RAC/PAK1 activity, which is down-regulated by the AR pathway prior to castration.
  Synergic inhibitory effects on PTEN-null CRPC tumorigenesis can be achieved by inhibiting
  p110β with other key components of the same (PAK1) or parallel pathways (Wnt/β-Catenin
  pathway).'
