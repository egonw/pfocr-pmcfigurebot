caption: BLWE regulated different metabolites in the brain of APP/PS1 mice. Analysis
  of PCA and PLS-DA in brain tissue of mice. K denotes the control group; MO denotes
  the model group and G denotes the BLWE H-dose group (A). Thermal map analysis of
  differential biomarkers. Metabolites marked in red represent up-regulated metabolites,
  while those marked in blue represent down-regulated metabolites. Differential metabolites
  were displayed in each row, and single samples were listed in each column (B). n
  = 3 per group. Overview of BLWE-regulated metabolic pathways. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
  refer to the alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism pathway, glyoxylate, and
  dicarboxylate metabolism pathway, glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway, pyrimidine
  metabolism pathway and d-glutamine and d-glutamate metabolism pathway, respectively
  (C).
