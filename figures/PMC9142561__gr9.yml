caption: Working model. Stimulation of RHOA/C-ROCK1 and RAC1-PAK4 pathways during
  early steps of capacitation induces LIMK1 activation and SSH1 phosphatase inhibition.
  The consequent phosphorylation of COFILIN in Ser3 inhibits its actin severing activity
  allowing the first actin polymerization event. This signaling cascade is an essential
  step for preparing the sperm to undergo AR. The thickness of the dashed arrows indicates
  the magnitude of the contribution of that pathway. AR, acrosomal exocytosis; LIMK1,
  LIM-kinase 1; PAK, p21-activated kinase; pLIMK1, phosphorylated LIMK1; ROCK, Rho-associated
  activated kinase; SSH, Slingshot family of protein phosphatase.
article_title: The early molecular events leading to COFILIN phosphorylation during
  mouse sperm capacitation are essential for acrosomal exocytosis.
