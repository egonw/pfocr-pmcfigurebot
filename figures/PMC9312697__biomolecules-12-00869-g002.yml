caption: The genomic molecular pathway by ATRA. In the absence of ligands, retinoic
  acid X receptors and RXR/RAR heterodimers bind to RAREs in the regulatory regions
  of target genes and inhibit transcription by recruiting HDAC or silencing mediators
  (SMRT and NCoR). After binding to ATRA, the corepressor complex is dissociated,
  and the coactivator binds to histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, resulting
  in transcriptional activation of target genes.
