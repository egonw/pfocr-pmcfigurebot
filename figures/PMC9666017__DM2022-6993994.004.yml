caption: 'Pygo1 upregulation in NSCLC was related to the Wnt signaling pathway. (a,
  b) Western blotting analysis of lysates with different treatments using rabbit polyclonal
  antibody to β-catenin, GAPDH was used as a loading control (n = 3). (c) Representative
  images of immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of β-catenin expression levels in NSCLC
  from different pathological grades and adjacent tissues and (d) quantitative analysis
  of IHC images using ImageJ. Grade I, grade II, and grade III refer to WHO-IA-LUAD,
  WHO-IIA-LUAD, and WHO-IIIB-LUSC, respectively. Scale bar: 100 μm. ns p ≥ 0.05, ∗p
  < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001. (e) Coimmunoprecipitation analysis of TCF4
  and β-catenin expression in A549 cells. (f, g) Western blotting analysis of Wnt/β-catenin
  signal proteins and quantitative analysis (n = 3); ns p ≥ 0.05, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p <
  0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001. (h) Necropsy photographs of mice and xenograft tumors on
  day 41. The results shown are representative of independent experiments. (i) Tumor
  weight was measured on day 41 of the experiment (mean ± SE). (j, k) Western blot
  analysis of the tissues samples and quantitative analysis (n = 3); ns p ≥ 0.05,
  ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001. Equal amounts of lysates were analyzed
  via western blot analysis and then probed for different proteins.'
