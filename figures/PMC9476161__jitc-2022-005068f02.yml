caption: Pos3Aa-p53 crystals restore p53 function in 4T1 cells. (A) Representative
  flow cytometry plots of 4T1 cells with different treatments. Cells were stained
  with the Caspase-3/7 Green Reagent which generates a green fluorescence on the activation
  of caspase-3/7. (B) Corresponding percentage of caspase-3/7-activated cells and
  (C) relative caspase-3/7 activity. (D) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of significantly
  upregulated genes. Hallmark gene set analysis of (E) significantly upregulated genes
  and (F) significantly downregulated genes. (G) Heat map showing the normalized expression
  of differentially expressed p53 target genes. Representative confocal images of
  4T1 tumor sections stained with (H) anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibodies and (I) anti-BAX
  antibodies. Tumors injected with Pos3Aa-p53 crystals exhibited higher level of cleaved
  caspase-3 and BAX. Data are presented as mean±SE of the mean. ns, no significant
  difference; *p<0.05; **p<0.01. BAX, bcl-2-associated X protein; CTL, control; FITC,
  fluorescein isothiocyanate; KEGG, kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes; KRAS,
  kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue; mTORC, mammalian target of rapamycin
  complex; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells.
  SSC-A, side scatter-area; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor α.
