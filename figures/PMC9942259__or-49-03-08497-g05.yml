caption: FOXP3 as a transcription suppressor binds to the promoter of LAPTM5. (A)
  The reporter plasmid of the pGL3-LAPTM5 promoter. (B) The relative luciferase activity
  in MDA-MB-231 treated by four groups revealed the regulation of FOXP3 on LAPTM5.
  (C) Chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to explore the binding sites of FOXP3
  targeting LAPTM5 promoter. TSS in the image was the transcription starting point
  of LAPTM5. (D and E) The overexpression efficiency of FOXP3 on mRNA and protein
  expression level were evaluated by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. (F and G)
  The mRNA and protein expression of LAPTM5 affected by FOXP3 overexpression were
  evaluated by RT-qPCR and western blotting. Data originated from three independent
  experiments and are presented as the mean ± SD. **P<0.01. FOXP3, forkhead box protein
  3; LAPTM5, lysosomal protein transmembrane 5; TSS, transcription start site; RT-qPCR,
  reverse transcription-quantitative PCR; OE, overexpressing; ns, not significant;
  NC, negative control.
