caption: Network of genes regulated after 48 h of chemerin (huChem-157)-treatment
  in at least two ovarian cancer cell lines, and connection to tumor growth inhibition.
  Activation of the network of interferon response genes is mediated by IFNα-induced
  formation of the upstream regulator and transcription factor ISGF3 (ISGF3 target
  genes are indicated by an asterisk). Broken arrows indicate transcriptional activation,
  other arrows protein interaction. Connection of genes to growth inhibition is indicated
  using solid arrows. The color intensity represents the measured grade of mRNA up-
  (red) or –down-regulation (green). * Type I interferon response genes (Ingenuity
  pathway analysis (IPA) software, Qiagen).
