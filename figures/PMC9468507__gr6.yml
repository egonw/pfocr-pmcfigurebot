caption: Visual outline of the proposed model demonstrating the pathway between alcohol
  use and negative mental health outcomes. Based on the reported model, alterations
  of SNPs on CRP-related genes, and current alcohol use can act to increase inflammation,
  which can in turn influence methylation at promoter regions on influential genes.
  Predicted outcomes of this pathway are increased anxiety and alterations in neural
  activity in regions responsible for emotional regulation.
