caption: 'SHH signaling pathway. Hh receptor PTC inhibits SMO signaling via an unknown
  mechanism, in the absence of the Hh ligands, and Gli molecules, processed into repressor
  forms, turn off the Hh-signaling pathway (a). PTC is unable to inhibit SMO in the
  presence of Hh. Gli molecules, processed to active forms (GliA), activate Hh target
  genes (b). Abbreviations: Gli glioma-associated oncogene, Gli1 glioma-associated
  oncogene 1, GliA glioma-associated oncogene activator, GliR glioma-associated oncogene
  repressor, Hh hedgehog, SMO smoothened, PTC patched, PTCH1 protein patched homolog
