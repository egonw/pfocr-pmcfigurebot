caption: Fine-tuning characterizes NF-κB IMD pathway expression. Following the stimulation
  of the IMD pathway, a non-identified epigenetic-related protein will deposit an
  acetyl group on the lysine 4 of histone 3 (H3K4Ac), nearby genes mostly coding for
  effectors (anti-microbial peptides). After being K63 ubiquitinilated by the E3-ligase
  Hyd, the conserved nuclear protein Akirin orchestrates a NF-κB transcriptional selectivity
  through the recruitment of the Osa-containing-SWI/SNF-like Brahma complex (BAP).
  The N-terminal portion of Relish (Rel-68) will then be recruited to the Akirin complex
  formed, which will lead to the expression of mostly effector genes of the pathway
  (anti-microbial peptides). In the case that the H3K4Ac mark is not deposited, Akirin
  will not be recruited. Rel68 will still bind to the consensus sequence and activate
  the expression of a second subset of genes, comprised of mostly negative regulators
  and some anti-microbial peptides. In brief, Akirin is a NF-κB co-factor acting as
  a molecular selector, required for the activation of a specific subset of Relish-dependent
  genes that correlates with the presence of H3K4Ac epigenetic marks. Akirin specifies
  the choice between subsets of NF-κB target genes, allowing Drosophila to modulate
  its innate immune response.
