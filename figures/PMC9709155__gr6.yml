caption: Increased oxidized cytosolic redox state activates p38 MAPK pathway. A, C,
  E) Quantification of KLF-1-positive nuclei in D1 animals. n = 30 animals per condition.
  Data are presented as mean ± SEM. **p < 0.01, ****p < 0.0001, Chi-square test. A)
  N2 animals expressing klf-1-yfp construct with lysine (K) 411 of KLF-1 mutated to
  alanine. Worms were treated with 10 μM H2O2 prior to imaging. B) Western blot from
  L4 and D1 animals where anti-P-p38 (p-PMK) and anti-HSP-1 (loading control) were
  used. C-D) Animals treated with p38 inhibitor (SB203580). D) Quantification of pcyp-34a8::gfp
  intensity n = 20 per condition. E) Left) isp-1;ctb-1 upon nsy-1 and sek-1 RNAi.
  Right) isp-1;ctb-1 upon pmk-1, pmk-2, or pmk-3 RNAi. F) Lifespans of isp-1;ctb-1
  mutant on pmk-1, pmk-2, or pmk-3 RNAi. n = 200 animals per condition. G) cyp-13a11
  expression levels were measured by qPCR upon pmk-1, pmk-2, or pmk-3 RNAi. n = 4
  per condition. Data were normalized to N2 EV and are presented as mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc test.
