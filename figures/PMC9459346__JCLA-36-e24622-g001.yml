caption: 'Label‐free analysis of ITI family‐related proteins. (A) The clustering heatmap
  shows distinction of active SLE (Active), stable SLE (Stable), and healthy controls
  (HC) in specifically proteomic features. (B) Abundance of ITI family‐related proteins
  in arbitrary units among Active, Stable, and HC. All results are mean ± SEM and
  significance was set at *p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤ 0.001, ns: not significant.
  (C) The clustering heatmap shows distinction of active LN (aLN), inactive LN (naLN),
  and healthy controls (HC) in specifically proteomic features. (D) Abundance of ITI
  family‐related proteins in arbitrary units among aLN, naLN, and HC.(E) PPI network
  of seven identified proteins of ITI family. (F) Pathway analysis of the six differentially
  expressed proteins using Metascape web‐based platform. ITI, Inter‐Alpha‐Trypsin
  Inhibitor; SLE, Systemic lupus erythematosus.'
