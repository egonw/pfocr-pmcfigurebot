caption: Key molecular events during cell division, cell elongation, and SCW thickening
  in internode 18. A, Pairwise comparisons of transcriptome profiles at the six developmental
  stages of the cell DZ. 1i-1, 3i-1, 6i-1, 9i-1, 14i-1, and 21i-1 represent the first
  segments of 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, 14-, and 21-cm internodes, respectively. B, Relative
  expression levels of six auxin transport genes identified in the modules of the
  first segments of 6- (6i-1) and 9-cm-long (9i-1) internodes. Data are means ± sd
  (n = 6). *P < 0.05. Each point represents the measured data. C, Pairwise comparisons
  of gene expression profiles at the six developmental stages of cell elongation and
  lignification. 14i-1, 14i-2, 14i-3, 14i-6, 14i-10, and 14i-12 represent the first,
  second, third, sixth, tenth, and twelfth 1-cm segments of the 14-cm-long 18th internode,
  respectively. D, Relative expression levels of representative MYB transcription
  factors in 14i-6 and 14i-10. Shown are log2 changes, and gene abundances in 14i-6
  were set as controls and normalized to 0 (log2). E, Expression of ABA synthesis
  and signaling pathway genes in 14i-6 and 14i-10. Data are means ± sd (n = 6). *P < 0.05.
  Each point represents the measured data. F, Pairwise comparisons of transcriptome
  profiles between the four developmental stages of SCW lignification. 23i-23 represents
  the 23rd segment of the 23-cm internode, and 20 d and 110 d represent the 29th segments
  of the 29-cm internodes collected at 20 and 110 days after the rapid growth stage,
  respectively. The rows in A, C, and F correspond to the categories, and the colors
  of the bands correspond to the average change in expression of all DEGs in that
  category.
