caption: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) promote immune escape by secreting CCL5.
  CCL5-deficient transgenic mice may further promote the aggregation of CD8+ T cells
  to tumor sites in CRC mouse models by inducing reduced expression of S100a9 (S100
  calcium-binding protein A9) in CD11bhiF4/80 low tumor-associated macrophages. Higher
  levels of CCL5 expression in colon tumor cells promote apoptosis of CD8+ T cells
  and increase infiltration of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Increased secretion of
  CCL5 by TNF-α-stimulated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be accomplished by further
  activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process via the CCL5/CCR1/β-catenin/Slug
  pathway. Overexpression of chemokines CCL5 and CXCL10 in CRC cells lacking DNA mismatch
  repair (d MMR) recruited and activated systemic CD8+ T cells further selectively
  to enter and further exert anti-tumor immune effects.
