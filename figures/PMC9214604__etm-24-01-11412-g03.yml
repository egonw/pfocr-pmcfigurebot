caption: 'SAA promotes mitochondrial biogenesis via the AMPK signaling pathway. (A)
  Following SAA and compound C stimulation, western blotting was performed to assess
  PGC-1α, NRF1 and TFAM protein expression levels. (B) mRNA expression levels of PGC-1α,
  NRF1 and TFAM were determined using RT-qPCR. (C) mtDNA/nDNA was determined using
  RT-qPCR and is presented relative to vehicle. (D) Following treatment of the cells
  with SAA, compound C and AICAR stimulation, western blotting was performed for the
  detection of p-AMPK and p-ACC expression levels. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 vs.
  vehicle; #P<0.05, ##P<0.01, ###P<0.001 vs. SAA treatment group. SAA, salvianolic
  acid A; AICAR, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide; AMPK, 5''AMP-activated
  protein kinase; PGC-1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator
  1-α; NRF1, nuclear respiratory factor 1; TFAM, mitochondrial transcription factor
  A; RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR; mtDNA/nDNA, mitochondrial/nuclear
  DNA, p, phosphorylated; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase.'
