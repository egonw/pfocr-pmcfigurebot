caption: the process of Nectin-4 regulating cancer development through PI3K/AKT pathway
  and promoting angiogenesis after hypoxia. Nectin-4 can downregulate miR-520c-3p
  to activate the PI3K/AKT/NF-κB pathway, promoting the progression and metastasis;
  Soluble nectin-4, which is formed by the shedding of Nectin-4 extracellular domain
  during hypoxia, can interact with integrin-β4 on endothelial cells to promote angiogenesis.
  This progress is realized via the Src, PI3K, Akt, and eNOS pathways, and may be
  related to PI3K-Akt-mediated NO formation.
