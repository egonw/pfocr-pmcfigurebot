figure_title: Sema3C induces nuclear Î²-catenin shuttling via Rac1 activation
caption: a Western blots of TCF1 and c-Myc proteins after PlexinD1 knockdown in GSCs.
  b Western blots of Rac1-GTP and Rac1 after Sema3C knockdown in GSCs. c Western blots
  of TCF1 and c-Myc in NSC23766-treated GSCs. d Western blots of TCF1 after Rac1 knockdown
  in GSCs. e Western blots of TCF1 and c-Myc in GSCs expressing FLAG-Rac1-Q61L in
  the setting of Sema3C knockdown. Immunoblots using whole cell lysates (left) and
  cytosol and nuclear fractions (right) are shown. Source data are provided as a Source
  data file. Western blots were repeated at least twice.
