caption: 'PI16 inhibits NF-κB activity. A NF-κB luciferase reporter activity in indicated
  cells. B Immunofluorescence of NF-κB/p65 subcellular localization in indicated cells
  (top); quantification of NF-κB/p65 nuclear localization (bottom). Scale bar 50 μm.
  C Western blot of NF-κB pathway regulators in indicated cells. D NF-κB luciferase
  reporter activity in indicated cells with NF-κB inhibitor. E Quantification of the
  indicated invaded cells was analysed in a transwell matrix penetration assay. JSH-23
  (20 μM, 48 h) and QNZ (1 μM, 48 h) were used. F IHC of subcutaneous tumours (PI16,
  NF-κB/p65, MMP9). Scale bar 300 μm. G IHC of metastatic lung tumour nodes (PI16,
  NF-κB/p65, MMP9). T24, 5637: in vitro; MB49: in vivo model. Scale bar 200 μm. A
  two-tailed t-test was used for statistical analysis. Error bars represent the mean ± SD
  of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01'
