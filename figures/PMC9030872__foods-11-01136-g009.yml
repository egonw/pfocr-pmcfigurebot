caption: 'Relationship between the gene expression and the moisture content of chestnut
  calcification. (A) The differential expression genes (DEGs) in water transport (GO:
  0006833) pathway; (B) the differential expression genes (DEGs) in response to water
  deprivation (GO: 0009414) pathway. Blue line: moisture content, red bars: transcriptomics
  RNA-seq analysis (FPKM). The letters (a,b) indicate significant differences (p <
  0.05).'
