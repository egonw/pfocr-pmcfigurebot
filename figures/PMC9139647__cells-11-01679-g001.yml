caption: HIF-dependent hypoxia signaling pathway. In normoxia, prolyl-hydrolyses (PHD)
  and Factor-inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor (FIH) hydroxylate HIF-α. Hydroxylation
  from the latter impairs HIF transactivation of target genes, whereas the former
  allows dimerization with the Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) protein, which directs HIF
  to ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. Hypoxic conditions stabilize
  HIF-α after PHD and FIH inactivation, allowing dimerization with HIF-ß subunits,
  translocation to the nucleus and association with coactivators, such as p300/CBP
  to regulate gene expression.
