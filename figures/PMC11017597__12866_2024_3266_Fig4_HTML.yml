caption: Function and pathway analysis of differential bacteria in burn and control
  groups. (A) Metabolic pathways of differential bacterial enrichment between three
  groups (by number of species); (B) Significantly different metabolic pathways and
  95% confidence intervals between the 4-hour post-burn group and the control group;
  (C) Significantly different metabolic pathways and 95% confidence intervals between
  the 6-hour post-burn group and the control group; (D) Significantly different metabolic
  pathways and 95% confidence intervals between the 4-hour post-burn group and the
  6-hour post-burn group
