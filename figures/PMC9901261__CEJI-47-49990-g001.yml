caption: Structure of TREM2 and related signaling pathway. After binding to the ligand,
  the extracellular domain of TREM2 transmits a relevant signal to its associated
  DAP12 via the lysine residue in its transmembrane domain followed by the phosphorylation
  of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in DAP12. This process
  leads to the activation of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) thus activating a cascade
  of downstream signaling pathways, including phospholipases C (PLC) activation induced
  calcium ion mobilization and activated Ras gene mediated extracellular regulated
  protein kinase (ERK) activation
