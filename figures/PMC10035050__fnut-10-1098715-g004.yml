caption: The inhibition of G protein attenuated the promoting effect of sodium acetate
  (NaAc) on milk fat synthesis. Cells used in this figure were pre-treated with PTX,
  Gallein, and NF023 for 2 h or GPR41 siRNA and GPR43 siRNA for 6 h, respectively,
  and then incubated with 0.75 mM NaAc for 24 h. (A) Targets of G protein-related
  inhibitors and siRNA. (B,C) TAG content in HC11 cells with different treatments,
  n = 5. (D,E) Phosphorylation degree of ERK and CREB in different treatments, n = 3.
  (F,G) Relative expression abundance of proteins related to milk fat synthesis, n = 3.
  All data with error bars are averages ± SEM. In histograms, no letter or the same
  letter above the bar graph indicates no significant difference (p > 0.05), and different
  letters indicate a significant difference (p < 0.05). Each small white dot represents
  a test value.
