caption: 'Pharmacological ascorbate affects the localization of key components of
  the DNA damage response pathway in NSCLC cells. (A) Immunofluorescence staining:
  H460 cells were treated with 4 mM P-AscH−, bovine catalase (200 U/mL), or co-treated
  with P-AscH− (4 mM) and catalase (200 U/mL) for 1 h. Then, cells were subjected
  to immunofluorescence staining with anti-γ-H2AX (green), anti-RAP80 (red), and anti-BRCA1
  (yellow) antibodies at 6 h post-treatment to observe protein localization. Cell
  nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Data are representative of three independent
  studies. Scale bar, 20 µm. (B) The levels of cytoplasmic γ-H2AX per cell were quantified.
  The data were expressed as fold change relative to the untreated control (n = 3;
  mean ± SEM; ** p < 0.01 vs. untreated control; † p < 0.05 vs. P-AscH−).'
