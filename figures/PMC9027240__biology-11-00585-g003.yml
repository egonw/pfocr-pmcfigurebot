caption: Schematic illustration of signal transduction by Wnt/ β-catenin signaling
  pathway. (A) In the absence of the ligand Wnt, β-catenin is degraded via the ubiquitin-mediated
  proteasome pathway. (B) In the presence of the ligand, β-catenin escapes from β-catenin
  destruction complex and translocates into the nucleus where it induces transcriptional
  activation of a plethora of target genes through the interaction with TCF/LEF.
