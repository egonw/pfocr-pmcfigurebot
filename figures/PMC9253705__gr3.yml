caption: Pexmetinib impaired p38-STAT3-NFATc1 axis during osteoclastogenesis. (A)
  (A) BMMs were pretreated with or without 0.4 μM Pexmetinib for 2 h before the addition
  of RANKL (50 ng/mL) for the indicated periods, the levels of indicated proteins
  were determined by Western blotting. (B) The grey levels of phosphorylated p38,
  JNK, ERK were quantified and normalized to total p38, JNK, ERK and β-actin using
  Image J. (C) BMMs were treated with or without 0.4 μM Pexmetinib under RANKL (50 ng/mL)
  stimulation. (D) The grey levels of phosphorylated STAT3 were quantified and normalized
  to total STAT3 and β-actin using Image J. (E) BMMs were treated with or without
  0.4 μM Pexmetinib following stimulated with RANKL (50 ng/mL) for 48 h and then subjected
  to ChIP analysis. (F-G) BMMs were cultured by osteoclast differentiation medium
  for 5 days under Pexmetinib (0.4 μM) treatment or Pexmetinib (0.4 μM) + Colivelin
  (2 μM) treatment. Then cells were stained by TRAP and the number and areas of osteoclasts
  from were measured. (H-I) BMMs were treated as descripted in F, then the total proteins
  of cells were extracted. The levels of indicated proteins were determined by Western
  blotting. Scale bar = 100 μm, *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01. Data are expressed as means ± SEM,
  n = 5.
