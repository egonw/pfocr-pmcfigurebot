caption: 'Functional and pathway annotation comparison of the genes assigned to the
  KEGG database. (A) Function annotation at KEGG level 1. (B) Function annotation
  at KEGG level 2. (C) Gene abundance comparison in the fructose and mannose metabolism
  pathway. (D) Gene abundance comparison in the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway.
  Notes for C and D: The genes belonging to the three samples with significant differences
  in the metabolic pathway map are marked by a color, in which Mec, Oce, and Gry are
  from left to right. The red to green color represents the high to low gene abundance.
