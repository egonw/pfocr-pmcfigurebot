caption: Prostaglandins biosynthesis pathway. Cyclooxygenases (COX) metabolize arachidonic
  acid first to prostaglandin G2 (PGG2) and then to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2). COX1
  and 2 are targeted by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which block
  the synthesis of prostaglandins. PGH2 is converted to prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), prostaglandin
  E2 (PGE2), prostaglandin I2 (PGI2), prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) and thromboxane A2
  (TXA2) by respective synthases. Each prostaglandin binds to specific receptors,
  which are members of the G protein-coupled receptor (GCPR) superfamily of seven
  transmembrane proteins, activating different downstream signaling pathways. cAMP
  cyclic adenosine monophosphate, IP3 inositol triphosphate.
