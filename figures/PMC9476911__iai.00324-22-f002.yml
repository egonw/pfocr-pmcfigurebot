caption: Cytokine expression is dependent on the TLR3 signaling pathway. Peritoneal
  macrophages from wild-type and TLR3−/− C57BL/6 mice were kept uninfected (control)
  or infected with stationary-phase promastigotes of L. (L.) amazonensis at a ratio
  of 5 parasites/cell. At 4 h p.i., total RNA was extracted and analyzed by quantitative
  real-time PCR for IFN1β, (A), IL-10 (C), and IL-12 (D). Protein extracts from macrophages
  infected by L. (L.) amazonensis or not infected (B) were submitted to Western blot
  analysis using anti-phospho-IRF3 (Ser 396) or anti-β-actin (endogenous control)
  antibodies, as depicted in the figure. The total stationary-phase promastigote RNA
  from cultures of L. (L.) amazonensis and L. (V.) guyanensis LRV high and LRV low
  was extracted, and a portion of this total RNA was treated with S1 nuclease. Then,
  4 mg of RNA (treated and untreated) was separated on a 1.2% agarose gel (E). LRV
  transcripts were also detected by semiquantitative PCR. As endogenous controls,
  we used hsp70 and kmp11 for L. (L.) amazonensis and L. (V.) guyanensis, respectively
  (F). Asterisks indicate significant differences between groups by ANOVA, with *,
  P < 0.05; **, P < 0.0017; or ***, P < 0.0001 (n = 3).
