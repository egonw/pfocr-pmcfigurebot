caption: 'CXCL1 and CXCL2 promotes SOR resistance by activating the CXCR2/ERK pathway.
  A HepG2 cells were treated with CM and SOR (10 μM) for 48 h. Cell lysates were collected
  and subjected to Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. G: HepG2 monoculture
  CM, GU: HepG2/U937 coculture CM, GTCM: HepG2/TAMCM coculture CM, GTCyto: HepG2/
  M2 MφsCyto coculture CM. B HepG2 cells were treated with indicated CM, SB225002
  (50 μM), and SOR (10 μM) for 48 h. Cell lysates were collected and subjected to
  Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. C HepG2 cells, Hep3B cells, and
  Huh7 cells were treated with CXCL1 or CXCL2 in combination with PD0325901 (10 μM)
  and SOR (10 μM for HepG2, 15 μM for Hep3B, 5 μM for Huh7) for 48 h. The bar graphs
  depict the percentages of apoptotic cells measured by flow cytometry with double
  staining for Annexin V and PI. ***P < 0.001 vs. untreated cells. D HepG2 cells,
  Hep3B cells, and Huh7 cells were treated with CXCL1 or CXCL2 in combination with
  PD0325901 (10 μM) for 24 h. The bar graphs depict the percentages of CD44+/CD133+
  cells measured by flow cytometry with double staining for CD44 and CD133. ***P < 0.001
  vs. untreated cells'
