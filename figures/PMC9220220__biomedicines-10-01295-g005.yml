caption: 'H&E staining showing the structure of renal tissue and damage score at different
  time intervals, showing (A) effects of MSCs pretreated with rapamycin on tubulointerstitial
  damage score at different time intervals, (B) kidney specimens with normal kidney
  structure (control group at 7 days), (C) apoptotic cells with dilated irregular
  tubules (black arrow) (Cisplatin 7 days), (D) prominent nucleoli with few apoptotic
  cells (white arrow) (ADMSC group at 7 days), (E) regeneration in the form of mitotic
  figures (arrow head) (Rapa + ADMSC group at 7 days). * Significant vs. control,
  # significant vs. Cis group and $ significant vs. ADMSC group.'
