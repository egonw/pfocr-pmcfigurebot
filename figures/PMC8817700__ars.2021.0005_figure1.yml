caption: 'TLRs: ligands and signaling pathways. All TLRs are transmembrane proteins.
  TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR6 are expressed on the cell surface, whereas TLR3,
  TLR7/8, and TLR9 are located almost exclusively in endosomes. Different TLRs recognize
  different microbial components. For example, TLR2 recognizes lipopeptides or peptidoglycan,
  a wall component of gram-positive bacteria. It also recognizes DAMPs such as HSPs
  and HMGB1. TLR2 heterodimerizes either with TLR1 to recognize triacylated lipopeptide
  or with TLR6 to recognize diacylated lipopeptides. TLR4 senses endotoxin, a wall
  component of gram-negative bacteria. TLR5 senses bacterial flagellin, a protein
  component of flagella. TLR3 recognizes viral dsRNA, whereas TLR7 and TLR8 are the
  sensors for ssRNA. Finally, TLR9 senses bacterial CpG-rich hypomethylated DNA (CpG
  DNA) motifs. Upon ligand binding, TLRs form dimers and recruit one or more adaptor
  proteins, namely, MyD88, TIRAP, TRIF, or TRAM, to the cytoplasmic domains of the
  receptors through their TIR domain interactions. All TLRs with the exception of
  TLR3 signal via the MyD88-dependent pathway. TIRAP acts as a bridge to recruit MyD88
  to TLR2 and TLR4 signaling, whereas TRIF is used in TLR3 signaling. In MyD88 signaling,
  MyD88 associates with IRAK4 and IRAK1. IRAK4 in turn phosphorylates IRAK1 and promotes
  their association with TRAF6, which serves as a platform to recruit and activate
  the kinase TAK1. Activated TAK1 activates the IKK complex, composed of IKKα, IKKβ,
  and IKKγ, which in turn catalyze phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of I-κB.
  I-κB degradation lets NF-κB (i.e., p50/p65) free to translocate from the cytoplasm
  to the nucleus where it activates multiple inflammatory cytokine gene expressions.
  The transcription factor IRF7 is activated as the downstream signaling molecule
  of TLR7/8 and TLR9. It is directly phosphorylated by IRAK1 and then translocated
  into the nucleus to induce the expression of type I IFN-α and IFN-inducible genes.
  In the Trif-dependent pathway, Trif activates sTBK1 and IKK-i, resulting in the
  IRF3 activation and translocation into the nucleus to activate the transcription
  of IFN-β and IFN-inducible genes. CpG, cytidine-phosphate-guanosine; DAMP, damage-associated
