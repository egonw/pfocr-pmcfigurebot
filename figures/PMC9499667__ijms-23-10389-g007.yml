caption: 'Loss-of-function analysis of ApSOCS-2 on bacterial survival and antimicrobial
  peptides production normalized to 18S and actin-1 (Actin-1 normalized: ). (A): dsApSOCS-2
  injection strongly reduced the production of ApSOCS-2 in hemocytes; (B): qPCR replication
  rate analysis exhibited that treatment of A. pernyi larvae with dsApSOCS-2 decreased
  the replication rate of M. luteus. The plasma antibacterial activity was increased
  in the ApSOCS-2 depletion (C–F). Plasma was sampled from A. pernyi treated with
  ApSOCS-2 dsRNA or GFP dsRNA. Equal volumes (10 μL) of plasma and bacterial suspension
  were incubated at 25 °C for 1 h. The bacteria (M. luteus) was injected into dsApSOCS-2
  treated A. pernyi larvae, and mRNA expression levels of (G) lebocin, (H) gloverin,
  (I) moricin, and (J) cecropin were measured by qRT-PCR. Normal: untreated sample;
  ML: M. luteus-treated; dsGFP + ML: treated with both dsGFP and M. luteus; and dsApSOCS-2
  + ML: treated with both dsApSOCS-2 and M. luteus. Asterisks indicate significant
  differences (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001).'
