caption: FOSL1 is the direct target of miR-195-5p in GBC. (A) The 3'-UTR of the FOSL1
  gene contains binding sites for miR-195-5p, according to bioinformatics analysis.
  (B) Dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to verify the relationship between miR-195-5p
  and FOSL1 in GBC-SD and NOZ cells. (C) Western blotting was used to determine the
  level of FOSL1 in GBC-SD and NOZ cells after transfection with miR-195-5p mimics
  and inhibitor or NC. Data are mean ± SD. *P<0.05 compared with control group. The
  experiment was repeated three times. GBC, gallbladder cancer; UTR, untranslated
  regions; FOSL1, Fos-like antigen-1; NC, negative control; SD, standard deviation.
article_title: MiR-195-5p suppresses the proliferation, migration, and invasion of
  gallbladder cancer cells by targeting FOSL1 and regulating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
