caption: The formation of iridoids in plants and aphids. (A) Labeling studies suggest
  that the biosynthesis of iridoids in the pea aphid A. pisum mimics the biosynthetic
  pathway in iridoid-producing plants. IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; DMAPP, dimethylallyl
  diphosphate; GPP, geranyl diphosphate; IDS, isoprenyl diphosphate synthase; GES,
  geranyl diphosphate synthase; G8H, geraniol 8-hydroxylase; HGO, 8-hydroxygeraniol
  oxidoreductase; ISY, iridoid synthase; NEPO, nepetalactol oxidase. (B) Relative
  expression of mevalonate and putative nepetalactone pathway genes in hind legs and
  front legs of different sexual stages of A. pisum. Relative expression data are
  based on RPKM values obtained by RNAseq. f-hl, hind legs of sexual females; f-fl,
  front legs of sexual females; af-hl, hind legs of asexual females; m-hl, hind legs
  of males.
