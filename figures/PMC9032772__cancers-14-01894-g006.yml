caption: Kinase activity in KDM5C knockdown cells compared to control cells. (A) Clustered
  heat map of increased and decreased phosphorylation of Tyr (PTK, top) and Ser/Thr
  (STK, bottom) bait peptides in control cells and stabile knockdown of KDM5C; (B)
  Volcano plots of the bait peptide phosphorylation from PTK (left) and STK (right)
  were assessed by student’s t-test; (C) Pathway analysis of peptides from (B) (p
  > 0.05) in a high-confidence interaction network (edges) from STRING DB. Node color
  indicates increased and decreased phosphorylation of Tyr (PTK) and Ser/Thr (STK)
  bait peptides. Node size indicates −log10(p value). Yellow border color indicates
  that the protein is involved in the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway. KCNA1, KCNA3,
  RYR1, PPP1R1A, CACNA1C, GRIK2, DSP, FXYD1, TH, KCNA2, GPR6, ENO2, EPB42, STMN2,
  PFKFB3, SCN7A, GABRB2, EFS, PHKA1, and MYBPC3 are not shown in the network because
  they showed no interaction with the kinases in the network.
