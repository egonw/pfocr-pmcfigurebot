caption: sCT treatment blocked the p38/JNK signaling pathway in the hippocampus of
  CRS-treated mice. (A) The phosphorylation levels of ERK/p38/JNK in the hippocampus
  of control mice, CRS-treated mice and CRS-treated mice with sCT treatment. (B) The
  phosphorylation levels of PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR in the hippocampus of control mice,
  CRS-treated mice, and CRS-treated mice with sCT treatment. (C) The expression of
  BDNF/PSD95/synapsin-1/snap25 in the hippocampus of control mice, CRS-treated mice
  and CRS-treated mice with sCT treatment. The data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA
  with Tukey’s multiple comparisons tests. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.
