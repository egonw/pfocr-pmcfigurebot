caption: 'Effect of pinostrobin with SB203580 (p38 inhibitor) or PD98059 (ERK inhibitor)
  on MAPK signaling pathway in B16F10 cells. Cells were pre-treated with SB203580
  (10 μM) and pinostrobin (100 μM) for 72 h to evaluate (a) the intracellular melanin
  contents, and (b) tyrosinase activity. B16F10 cells were treated with SB203580 (10
  μM) for 30 min, followed by treatment with pinostrobin (100 μM) for 24 h. Subsequently,
  the expression of (c,d) p-p38, (e,f) tyrosinase, (g) TRP 1 and (h) MITF was analyzed
  by Western blotting. B16F10 cells were co-treated with PD98059 (10 μM) and pinostrobin
  (100 μM) for 72 h to evaluate (i) the intracellular melanin contents, and (j) tyrosinase
  activity. Blots were quantified using ImageJ software. Protein levels were normalized
  to the corresponding loading controls. The untreated cells were regarded as 100%.
  Values are expressed represent as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
  *** p < 0.001, and * p < 0.05 compared with control group; ### p < 0.001 and # p
  < 0.05 compared with pinostrobin group without SB203580 or PD98059. NS; not significant.'
