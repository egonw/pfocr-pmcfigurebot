figure_title: PYURF (NDUFAFQ) is a CoQ- and CI-related chaperone
caption: a, b, Relative abundance of CoQ10 (a) and NDUFS3 (b) versus statistical significance
  across all KO lines. c, Relative abundance of dihydroorotate (DHO) and CoQ10 in
  the indicated KO cell lines compared to WT cells. (a-c) Data displayed as mean,
  n = 3–4, and two-sided Welch’s t-test. d, Level of complex I (CI), CI-assembly factor,
  and CoQ biosynthetic proteins in the indicated KO cell lines as assessed by immunoblotting.
  e, Relative abundance of CoQ10 and biosynthetic pathway intermediates analyzed via
  targeted LC-MS (mean, n = 3–4, two-sided Welch’s t-test). PPHB, polyprenyl-hydroxybenzoate;
  DMQ, demethoxy-coenzyme Q; DMeQ, demethyl-coenzyme Q. f, CoQ biosynthesis pathway
  following polyisoprenoid tail attachment. Molecules quantified in (e) are indicated
  in red. 4-HB, 4-hydroxybenzoate; PPDHB, polyprenyl-dihydroxybenzoate; PPVA, polyprenyl-vanillic
  acid; DDMQ, demethoxy-demethyl-coenzyme Q. Supportive role for reactions is indicated
  by ‘+’ symbol next to arrows. g, Level of the indicated transcripts in 293 cells
  treated with siRNA for five days as assessed by qPCR (mean ± s.d., n = 3). h, Level
  of COQ5 and NDUFAF5 in mouse C2C12 cells treated with the indicated siRNAs for five
  days as assessed by immunoblotting. i, Relative abundance of protein interactors
  for WT PYURF compared to maltose-binding protein (MBP) captured from a HAP1 mitochondrial
  lysate detected via immunoprecipitation (IP)-LC-MS/MS analysis (mean, n = 3, two-sided
  Student’s t-test). j, Purity of NDUFAF5, WT PYURF, c.289_290dup patient variant,
  and point mutants analyzed via SDS-PAGE and Coomassie stain. k, Melting temperature
  of NDUFAF5 with combinations of WT PYURF or c.289_290dup mutant PYURF, peptide,
  and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) compared to NDUFAF5 only as measured by differential
  scanning fluorimetry (mean ± s.d., n = 3). For western and gel source data, see
