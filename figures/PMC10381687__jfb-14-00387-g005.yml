caption: SatPt-NPs overcome drug resistance by maximizing drug internalization. The
  platinum uptake (A) and relative drug uptake fold (B) of A2780DDP cells compared
  to the drug uptake of A2780 after 1, 2, and 6 h of drug treatment. Data were normalized
  by the uptake of cisplatin at 1 h for A2780 cells which was set as 1; typical cellular
  uptake by Rh B-loaded NPs (C). Uptake of SatPt-NPs at 4 Â°C was substantially inhibited,
  indicating an energy-dependent internalization pathway (D). ** p < 0.01.
