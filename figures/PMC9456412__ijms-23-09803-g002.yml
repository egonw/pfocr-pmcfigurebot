caption: Cyclooxygenases 1 and 2 (COX-1 and COX-2), which are key enzymes in the conversion
  of arachidonic acid into bioactive prostanoids play a central role in the inflammatory
  cascade. Prostaglandin families (postaglandin J2) are endogenous toxic products
  of cyclooxygenases, and because their levels are significantly increased upon brain
  injury, they are actively involved in neuronal dysfunction induced by pro-inflammatory
  stimuli. The line of evidence indicates an important interplay between the cannabinoid
  receptor type 1 (CB1) and cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2) and endocannabinoids
  (ECB) are key inflammatory and redox-dependent processes. The endocannobinoid system
  (ECS) may also control oxidative stress by directly or indirectly modulating CB1
  and CB2 signaling or CB receptor-independent processes via COX-2-dependent eicosanoid
  pathway. Modulation of cellular redox homeostasis is induced by the ECS. The reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) act as second messengers and exert oxidative activity to influence
  immune, inflammatory, and other signaling processes.
