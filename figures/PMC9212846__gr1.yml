caption: Expression of oncogenes causes bidirectional remodeling of cellular proteome
  and reveals strong downregulation of IFN-inducible antiviral pathways. All mass
  spectrometry data represent three biological replicates for each cell line. t test
  significance was corrected for multiple hypothesis testing as described in . A,
  upset plot summarizing intersections of proteomics results. Thresholds for upregulation
  and downregulation were p ≤ 0.05, log2FC≥ |1|. B–D, schema of antiviral pathways
  are colored to represent general trends in proteomics. Proteins that were suppressed
  in MYC or signal transduction oncogene models are dark blue. Proteins that were
  not dramatically changed in MYC or signal transduction oncogene models are gray.
  Proteins that were not detected in any dataset are white. B, pathway schema for
  T1IFN response. The dsRNA and dsDNA sensors drive cascades controlling transcription
  of IFNα and IFNβ. Secreted IFNα and IFNβ stimulate autocrine and paracrine signaling
  by binding to the interferon receptor. This activates JAK/STAT signaling leading
  to formation of the ISGF3 complex that regulates transcription of hundreds of ISGs.
  C, pathway schema for OAS-RNASEL system. dsRNA sensors OAS1-3 catalyze the synthesis
  of 2′-5′ oligoadenylate chains, ligands to latent RNASEL. Activated RNASEL indiscriminately
  cleaves cellular and viral RNA. D, pathway schema for EIF2AK2 (PKR) activation.
  EIF2AK2 is activated by dsRNA and phosphorylates EIF2A to inhibit protein synthesis.
  E, heatmap demonstrating decreased protein expression of over 35 ISGs (with p ≤
  0.05). dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; IFN, interferon;
  ISG, interferon-stimulated gene; T1IFN, type 1 interferon.
