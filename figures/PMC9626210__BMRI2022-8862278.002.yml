caption: 'Isoflavones decrease the RANKL gene expression by binding to estrogen receptors.
  The PTH stimulatory effect on the expression of the RANKL gene is reduced by isoflavones
  and thus bone resorption induced by PTH is decreased. Decrease of RANKL levels might
  be induced by the proapoptotic property of the isoflavone on osteoclasts via the
  calcium signaling pathway or suppression of RANKL secretion and expression. The
  increased OPG levels by isoflavones may occur via an estrogen-mediated mechanism
  or a nongenomic effect of topoisomerase II inhibition. (RANK: receptor activator
  of NF-κB; RANKL: receptor activator of NF-κB ligand; OPG: osteoprotegerin).'
