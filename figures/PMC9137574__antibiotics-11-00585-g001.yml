caption: 'The impact of streptozotocin and ciprofloxacin treatment on microbiome composition.
  (A) Experimental design used in this study. Figure made with BioRender.com. (B)
  Weighted UniFrac Distance between 16S rRNA amplicons. (C) Relative abundance of
  detected phyla in 16S rRNA amplicons. Data represent mean ± SEM. (D) Differentially
  abundant bacterial genera following ciprofloxacin treatment in STZ-treated and normoglycemic
  mice versus vehicle controls alongside their interaction value. Data represent log2
  fold change. (E) Differentially abundant bacterial genera between STZ-treated and
  control mice after ciprofloxacin administration. Data represent log2 fold change
  ± SEM. (F) Linear discriminant analysis of MetaCyc pathway abundance as predicted
  using PICRUSt. Data represent STZ-treated versus control mice after ciprofloxacin
  treatment. For all panels, n = 8–12 per group for (B): permutational ANOVA (* p
  < 0.05; *** p < 0.001). For (D,E): differentially abundant = Benjamini–Hochberg
  adjusted p value < 0.05.'
