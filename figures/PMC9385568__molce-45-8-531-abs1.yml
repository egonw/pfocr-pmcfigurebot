figure_title: Senescent p21high cells in epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) aggravate
  metabolic dysfunction in obese animals. In obesity, p21high cells are specifically
  accumulated in stromal vascular fraction of eWAT and they have increased expression
  of inflammatory genes and NFκB signaling pathway. Transplantation of p21high cells
  provokes glucose intolerance whereas clearance of p21high cells by senolytic agents
  relieves insulin resistance in obese animals
