caption: 'The effect of Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation on SIRT1 protein and cell
  apoptosis. (a) Western blot was utilized to detect β-catenin, SIRT1, Foxo4, and
  Caspase-3 protein expression in the different cell groups. (b) The β-catenin and
  SIRT1 expression in different groups of cells detected by immunofluorescence. Magnification:
  200x. ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01; ∗∗∗P < 0.001.'
