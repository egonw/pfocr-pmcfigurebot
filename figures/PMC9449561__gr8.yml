  (A) PCA score plot of the three groups (control, model and YCr–H groups), (B) PLS-DA
  score plot of the control, model and YCr–H groups, (C) OPLS-DA score plot of the
  model group and YCr group, (D) S-loading plot according to the OPLS-DA analysis
  of the YCr–H and model groups, (E) Differential metabolites clustering heatmap (VIP
  value > 1.0, P < 0.05) between the Model and YCr–H groups; (F) Metabolic pathway
  analysis based on significantly differential metabolites.
