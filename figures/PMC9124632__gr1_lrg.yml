caption: Interferon α/β production and receptor signaling. Recognition of microbial
  products by a range of PRR on the surface or inside the cell activates several distinct
  signaling pathways, inducing the expression of the genes encoding IFN α/β. Attachment
  of IFN-Is to IFN-α receptor stimulates several signaling pathways, creating different
  biological effects in the cell. The classical pathway contains STAT1–STAT2–IFN-IRF9
  signaling complex (also known as ISGF3 complex). This complex binds to ISREs in
  gene promoters and activates ISGs. Heterodimers and homodimers of some STAT molecules
  including STAT3, STAT4, and STAT5 may also be activated downstream. MAPKs and the
  PI3K pathways are STAT independent signaling pathways that can also be involved
  following recognition of IFN α/β by the receptor. PRR, pattern recognition receptors;
