caption: Expression of an isoform of TEAD1ΔE6 is inversely proportional to the expression
  of genes related to the Hippo signaling pathway. (A, B) Heatmaps (top) of individual
  patient samples profiled based on events and according to changes in CTGF (A) and
  CYR61 (B) mRNA level and the percent spliced in index (PSI) of TEAD family alternative
  exons. Pearson's correlation coefficient of the PSI versus CTGF and CYR61 expression
  and statistical analyses are shown at the bottom of the heatmaps. (C, D) Nucleotide-sequence
  alignments of the regions encoding TEAD1F.L. and TEAD1ΔE6. Red nts representing
  the exon 6 region. The splicing patterns of TEAD1 exon 6 in human cell lines (C) and
  mouse tissues (D) were analyzed by RT-PCR. The upper and lower bands represent results
  for regions encoding TEAD1F.L. and TEAD1ΔE6, respectively. (E, F) Comparison of
  CTGF and CYR61 mRNA levels versus the ratio of TEAD1 mRNA level to TEAD1 exon 6
  inclusion in BLCA and KIRC. (G) Heatmaps of CTGF and CYR61 mRNA levels according
  to the PSI value of TEAD1 exon 6 or TEAD1 mRNA level in TCGA datasets. Pearson's
  correlation coefficients are shown at the top of the heatmaps. (H) Kaplan–Meier
  survival plot showing survival rates of patients with TEAD1 exon 6 high PSI (purple)
  and low PSI (green) in KIRC and LUAD. BLCA, Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma; BRCA,
  Breast invasive carcinoma; COAD, Colon adenocarcinoma; ESCA, Esophageal carcinoma;
  HNSC, Head and Neck squamous cell carcinoma; KIRC, Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma;
