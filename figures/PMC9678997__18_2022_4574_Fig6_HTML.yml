caption: LRRK2 and PINK1 reversely modulate the TH–DA pathway and PD-like symptoms
  in Drosophila PD models. Control yellow white or TG Drosophila are crossed with
  ddc-GAL4 to induce expressions of human PINK1 and/or LRRK2 in DA neurons in Drosophila
  heads. Drosophila heads are harvested after 3 days culture, homogenized and subjected
  to Western blot analysis of TH protein and HPLC analysis of DA content. A and B
  WT PINK1 suppresses TH expression in Drosophila heads. A Western blot data of TH
  bands in Drosophila heads of control and TG WT PINK1 Drosophila. B Densitometric
  analysis of TH bands in Western blot gels in A. *, at least P < 0.05, compared with
  the arbitrary value of TH bands in control Drosophila heads. C and D Mutant G309D
  PINK1 up-regulates TH expression in Drosophila heads. C Western blot data of TH
  levels in Drosophila heads of control and TG mutant G309D PINK1 Drosophila. D Densitometric
  analysis of TH bands in Western blot gels in C. *P < 0.05, compared with the arbitrary
  value of TH bands in control Drosophila heads. E and F HPLC analysis of DA content
  in Drosophila heads of control and TG WT PINK1 (E) and mutant G309D (F) Drosophila.
  *, at least P < 0.05, compared with DA content in Drosophila heads of control Drosophila.
  G–J Regulations of TH expression and DA content in Drosophila heads by WT or mutant
  PINK1 and/or LRRK2. G and H WT, but not G309D PINK1, can alleviate mutant G2019S
  LRRK2-induced up-regulation of TH expression level in Drosophila heads. G Western
  blot data of TH levels in Drosophila heads of control, mutant G2019S LRRK2, mutant
  G2019S LRRK2 plus WT or mutant G309D PINK1 double TG Drosophila. B Densitometric
  analysis of TH bands in Western blot gels in A. *, at least P < 0.05, compared with
  the arbitrary value of TH protein bands in control Drosophila heads. I WT PINK1
  can alleviate mutant G2019S LRRK2-induced PD-like symptoms. *, at least P < 0.05,
  compared with the percentage of Drosophila on top of control Drosophila cultured
  for 40 or 60 days, respectively. J HPLC analysis of DA content in Drosophila heads
  of control, and transgenic WT and mutant PINK1 and/or LRRK2 Drosophila lines. *,
  at least P < 0.05, compared with DA content in Drosophila heads of control Drosophila
  cultured for the respective days
