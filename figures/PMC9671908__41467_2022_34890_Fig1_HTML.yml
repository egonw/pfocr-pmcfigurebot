figure_title: Genome-wide CRISPR screening identifies the mTOR pathway as a determinant
  of chemosensitivity
caption: a CRISPR knockout screens in 4292 cells. Dashed bars indicate depleted sgRNAs.
  b Gene ranking based on β scores in the two screens. Representative top enriched
  or depleted genes were labeled on the plots. Red and blue indicate significant gene
  enrichment or depletion with p < 0.05. Two-sided permutation test. False discovery
  rate (FDR) correction of the p-value was performed by the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.
  c Overlap of significantly enriched or depleted genes in gemcitabine and selinexor
  screens. d Enrichment of positive, and depletion of negative regulators of mTOR
  signaling in gemcitabine and selinexor screens. The mTOR pathway genes were ranked
  based on the average β score in the two screens. Shown are the top 15 enriched and
  10 depleted genes.
