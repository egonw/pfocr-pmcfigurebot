caption: 'Carboxylic acid catabolic process gene expression associated with increased
  progression of diabetes. Pathway analysis between diabetic and controls in the proximal
  tubules of (A) mice and (B) humans. X-axis: Pathways ordered by p-values. Y-axis:
  âˆ’Log10 of p-values. (C) Principal component analysis of human diabetic proximal
  tubule samples clustered with carboxylic acid catabolic process genes using partitioning
  around medoids. Arrows represent the degree of impact and direction of relationship
  for the top five genes influencing the clusters. (D) Bar graph depicting the frequency
  of moderate progressors and rapid progressors, as defined by rate of decline in
  kidney function, within the two carboxylic acid groups identified in (C).'
