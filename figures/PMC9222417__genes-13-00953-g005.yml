caption: The regulatory network of key differentially expressed genes in yellow-fleshed
  turnip. (a) The regulatory network of carotenoid accumulation in yellow-fleshed
  turnip. PSY, phytoene synthase; Z-ISO, ζ-carotene isomerase; ZDS, ζ-carotene desaturase;
  LYCE, lycopene ε-cyclase; LYCB, lycopene β-cyclase. The differentially expressed
  gene changes were represented by the log2FPKM. The differential carotenoid metabolite
  changes are shown in the column diagram. (b) Purple circles represent carotenoid
  metabolites. Yellow blocks represent structural genes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis
  pathway. Blue circles represent different families of transcription factors whose
  expression was highly correlated with the above five carotenoid metabolites. The
  size of the circle and block represents the number of correlations.
