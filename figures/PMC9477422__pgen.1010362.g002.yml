figure_title: GSEA Predicts High EGFR Activity in PTPRH Mutant NSCLC Tumors
caption: Numerous bioinformatics methods illustrate the importance of PTPRH mutations
  in human non-small cell lung cancer. A) data analyzed from the International Genome
  Consortium as well as The Cancer Genome Atlas show PTPRH mutations occurring in
  a number of human cancers. Lung cancer is highlighted due to the relationship of
  PTPRH with EGFR, and EGFRs importance in lung cancer. B) Lollipop plot of human
  PTPRH mutations correlated with predicted EGFR activity. Each dot represents a human
  NSCLC tumor with a mutation in PTPRH. Dot color corresponds to EGFR activity predicted
  through ssGSEA. C) CBIO oncoplot of NSCLC tumor mutation data from TCGA. Patient
  tumors with PTPRH mutations are shown to be mutually exclusive from patient tumors
  with EGFR mutations. D) Clustered heatmap of pathway activation prediction through
  GSEA. Each column represents a NSCLC tumor with mutation status corresponding to
  the color coded top bar. Each row represents predicted activation of pathways through
  ssGSEA. E) GSEA random walk plots show predicted activation of PI3K and AKT within
  PTPRH mutant tumors compared to PTPRH WT tumors.
