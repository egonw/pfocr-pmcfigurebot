figure_title: Forced activation of Rheb resulted in the absence of pheromone response
caption: '(A) Strains carrying the Rheb-activating mutations cannot form infective
  filaments. Control and the indicated mutant strains were spotted on minimal ammonium
  media charcoal plates and incubated for 24 h at 28°C. The white fuzzy colonies reflect
  the formation of b-dependent filaments. (B) qRT-PCR for the indicated genes from
  control (FB1) and mutant cells incubated for 6 hours in minimal ammonium media in
  the presence of synthetic a2 pheromone (2.5 μg/ml). Rap indicated the addition of
  1μg/ml rapamycin. Values are referred to the expression of each gene in the control
  strain. Each column represents the mean value of three independent biological replicates.
  Error bars represent the SD. (C) Cell images from cultures of (B) showing the absence
  of conjugation tubes in mutant strains. Bar: 15 μm.'
