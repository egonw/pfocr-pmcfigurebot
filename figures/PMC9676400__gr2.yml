caption: CAV infection blocks ISD-mediated IFN-β expression. Following incubation
  with 1 × 104 TCID50 CAV for 3 h, cells were transfected with or without ISD before
  RT-qPCR. At 6 h post ISD transfection, cells were harvested at 6 h and evaluated
  for the level of IFN-β mRNA using RT-qPCR. Data are presented as mean ± standard
  deviations from at least three independent experiments; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P
  < 0.001.
