caption: Kinase activity of CDK1, CDK7, and CSNK2A1 is elevated in cabozantinib-resistant
  MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells. (A) Kinases with only KSEA scores (at least 2 substrates)
  were plotted. (B) Heatmap of kinases with KSEA and KSEAM scores and average logarithmic
  (base 2) fold-change for kinase expression in resistant/sensitive. Statistics for
  z-scores and kinase fold-changes were calculated by a one-tailed Student’s t-test
  controlled by the Benjamini–Hochberg FDR (False-Discover Rate) procedure. * = corrected
  p-value < 0.05 at FDR = 0.1.
