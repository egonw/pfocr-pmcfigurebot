caption: MetaCore enrichment pathway analysis of genes coexpressed with cadherin 1
  (CDH1). The top 10% of expressed genes coexpressed with CDH1 from both Metabric
  (1804 genes) and TCGA (2003 genes) were extracted. Overlapping (805) genes were
  integrated to implement a pathway analysis, which formed a pathway list ordered
  by the -log p value. “Immune response B cell antigen receptor (BCR) pathway” was
  at the top of the pathway list when performing the “biological process” analysis.
  The figure demonstrates interactions between genes and proteins. Symbols represent
  proteins. Arrows depict protein interactions (green, activation; red, inhibition).
  Thermometer-like histograms indicate microarray gene expressions (blue, downregulated;
  red, upregulated).
