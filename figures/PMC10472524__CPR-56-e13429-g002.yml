caption: 'Characterization of hspASCs subtypes in hspASCs‐hECs co‐culturing model
  under different hydrogel conditions via single cell analysis. (A) Immunofluorescence
  analysis of the cell ratio in the hspASCs‐hECs coculture system. ECs marker: CD31;
  ASCs marker: Nes. Scale bar = 50 μm. (B,C) The quantification of CD31+/CD31− cells.
  ***p < 0.001 (t‐test, mean ± SEM). (D) Immunostaining for CDH5 in the hspASCs‐hECs
  co‐culture model under COLI/SRGN‐COLI conditions. (E,F) The bar graph represents
  the proportion of CDH5+ cells in the hspASCs‐hECs co‐culture model. *p < 0.05 (t‐test,
  mean ± SEM). (G) UMAP plot integrates the scRNA‐seq data from hspASCs‐hECs co‐culture
  under COLI/SRGN‐COLI conditions. (H) The bar graph shows the cell proportion comparison
  of ECs and ASCs. Cell number (n) and adjusted p‐value were shown on the graph (hypergeometric
  tests and Benjamini–Hochberg correction). (I) The bar graph shows the cell proportion
  of the re‐cluster a1 subgroup. (Hypergeometric tests and Benjamini–Hochberg correction).
  (J) The heat map indicates representative significantly enriched GO terms and pathways
  of re‐cluster a1 subgroup by GSVA analysis. (K,L) Proliferation and EMT score of
  re‐clusters a1 subgroup (Wilcox test). (M) The significantly differentially expressed
  genes of axon growth inhibitory and permissive molecular in re‐cluster a1 subgroup.
  Fold changes of gene expression more than two‐fold were listed.'
