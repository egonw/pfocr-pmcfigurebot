caption: 'Fyn affects trophoblast cell migration, apoptosis and proliferation through
  the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. (a) Transwell assays were performed to determine cell
  migration ability after Fyn overexpression and/or treatment with U0126. (b, c) Cell
  apoptosis under various conditions was determined by flow cytometry. (d) Cell viability
  under various conditions was determined by CCK-8 assays. All experiments were repeated
  three times. âˆ—p < 0.05 vs. all other groups. OE vector: overexpression vector; OE
  Fyn: Fyn-overexpressing vector.'
