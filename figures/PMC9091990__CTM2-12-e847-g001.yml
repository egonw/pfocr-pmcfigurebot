caption: Clinically‐independent but genetically‐similar primary tumours in synchronous
  multiple primary lung cancers (sMPLCs). Heatmap of mutations shared by lung tumour
  lesions and the clonal architecture of multifocal tumours. The number of total mutations
  identified in each tumour (T) from patients (P) with sMPLCs and the number of mutations
  shared by any pair of lesions were shown. Phylogenetic trees indicated the clonal
  structure of the sequenced tumour regions in each patient. The developmental stage
  and tumour location of each lesion were indicated
