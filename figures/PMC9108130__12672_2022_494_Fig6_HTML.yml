caption: KLF14 regulates related molecules in the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway. A When
  KLF14 was overexpressed, the Western blot results showed that PI3K, PDK1, AKT and
  p-AKT were downregulated and Bax was upregulated in SiHa cells compared to the Lv-control
  group cells. PI3K, PDK1, AKT and p-AKT were downregulated, and Bax showed no significant
  difference in HeLa cells compared to the Lv-control group cells. B Quantitative
  statistics of protein expression. (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001)
article_title: KLF14 targets ITGB1 to inhibit the progression of cervical cancer via
