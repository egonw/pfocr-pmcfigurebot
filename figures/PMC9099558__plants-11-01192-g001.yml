caption: 'Biosynthetic pathways and metabolite analysis of NR and STLs in lettuce
  latex. (A) Biosynthetic routes of diverse secondary isoprenoids in lettuce latex.
  (B) STL detection in lettuce latex by LC-qTOF. [M+H]+ ions were detected in positive
  ion mode. (C) NR detection in lettuce latex by HPLC-GPC (gel permeation column)-ELSD
  (evaporative light scattering detector). Abbreviations used are: DHDD, dehydrodolichyl
  diphosphate; STL, sesquiterpene lactone; NR, natural rubber; IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate;
  FPP, farnesyl diphosphate; PDI, polydispersity index. The key enzymes for each biosynthetic
  pathway are labeled in red. Representative STL products are shown. Schemes follow
  the same formatting.'
