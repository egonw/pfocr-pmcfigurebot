caption: HOXC10 regulated the expression of ABCC3 through β-catenin. qRT-PCR (A) and
  Western blot (B) were to verify the regulation effect of HOXC10 on β-catenin and
  ABCC3. (C) Western blot was to detect the expression of β-catenin, ABCC3 and HOXC10
  after the treatment with the inhibitor (IWR-1-endo) or agonist (SKL2001) of WNT
  pathway. ns P > 0.05, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
