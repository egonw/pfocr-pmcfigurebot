caption: Enrichment maps of GSEA gene sets revealed strong induction of IFN signaling
  in fucoidan-treated BMDCs. (A) Unformatted GSEA gene sets enrichment map. Each node
  (circle) represents a distinct pathway, and edges (lines) represent the number of
  genes overlapping between two pathways, determined using the similarity coefficient.
  FDR < 0.08. Edge cutoff (Similarity) < 0.25. (B) AutoAnnotated enrichment map. Clusters
  were identified by the Cytoscape app and annotated with a representative label gleaned
  from the characteristics of the individual gene sets.
