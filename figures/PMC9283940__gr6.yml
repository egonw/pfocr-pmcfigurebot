  of acdh-1 by ETC complex II inhibition(A) Metabolic gene RNAi in Pacdh-1:GFP animals
  supplemented with vitamin B12 and with an sdha-2 mutation (left), exposed to propionate
  (low B12 mechanism-I, middle) and with an nhr-10 deletion and mthf-1 mutation (low
  B12 mechanism-II, right).(B) Model of complex interactions among metabolic pathways
  regulating acdh-1 expression.
