caption: Correlation network diagram of the ko00041 pathway (pentose and glucuronate
  interconversions). (a) The correlation network diagram. Red color represents the
  enriched differential metabolites in the pathway, blue represents the differential
  genes enriched in the pathway, and the straight line represents the correlation
  between them. The higher the degree of the node, the more related straight lines,
  the node is considered more important. (b) The heatmap shows the expression level
  of correlated genes. (c) The heatmap shows the accumulation level of correlated
  metabolites.
