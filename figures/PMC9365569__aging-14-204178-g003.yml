caption: 'CFHR3 is a critical effector for miR-590-3p in the regulation of HCC cell
  malignant phenotypes. (A, B) The difference for OS rates (A) or DFS rates (B) between
  HCC patients with low and high miR-590-3p levels in HCC tissues is shown as a survival
  curve, respectively. (C) An analysis shows linear regressions and Pearson correlations
  between CFHR3 and miR-590-3p levels in HCC tissues in the TCGA database. (D) The
  levels of miR-590-3p in five HCC cell lines and normal liver cells (MIHA) were determined
  by qPCR. (E, F) GSEA plots show enrichment of gene signatures associated with the
  liver cancer proliferation and metastasis in HCC tissues with a miR-590-3p high
  as compared with miR-590-3p low (E, Chiang Liver Cancer Subclass Proliferation Up;
  F, Roessler Liver Cancer Metastasis Up). (G–J) MHCC-97L cells were treated with
  the indicated concentration of miR-590-3p precursor, and CFHR3 protein levels (G),
  cell growth (H), migration, and invasion (I, J) were determined. (Remarks: * represents
  P < 0.05; ** represents P < 0.01; Data are presented as mean ± SD).'
