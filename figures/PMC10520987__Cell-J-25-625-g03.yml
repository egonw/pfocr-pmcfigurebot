caption: Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) translocation to the nucleus.
  A. Western blot assessment of nuclear (N) and cytosolic (C) protein fractions. The
  nuclear fraction did not detect any GAPDH band; however, there was a prominent protein
  band for histone 4. B. Western blot assessment of relaxin 2 (RLXH2) activated nuclear
  fraction. The untreated nuclear fraction did not show any band with the Nrf2 antibody;
  however, there was a protein band for Nrf2 in the RLXH2-activated nuclear fraction
  at 12 and 24 hours. C. There is increased expression of HO-1 mRNA in the RLXH2-activated
  NCI-N87 cells (12 hours and 24 hours) with P<0.05 at 12 hours compared to 0 hours,
  and P<0.01 at 24 hours compared to 12 hours). D. There is a significant increase
  in HO-1 expression level in the RLXH2-activated NCI-N87 cells (12 hours and 24 hours).
  The results are the average of an independent experiment. *; P<0.05 and **; P<0.01
