caption: 'ERα regulates mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy signaling. (A) Representative
  images of immunofluorescence staining for TOMM20 (green) and DAPI (blue) in A7r5
  cells. (B,C) Western blot analysis (B) and quantification compared to GAPDH (C)
  of FIS1, DRP1 S616, DRP1, Parkin, PINK1, Mfn1 and Mfn2 protein levels in A7r5 cells.
  (D,E) Left, western blot analysis of ERα, Parkin and PINK1 protein levels in mitochondria
  (D) and cytoplasm (E) of A7r5 cells, respectively. The A7r5 cells mentioned above
  were incubated with FBS for 72 h after transfected with adenoviruses expressing
  ERα or noncoding control for 48 h. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 vs. control;
  #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01 and ###p < 0.001 vs. FBS.'
