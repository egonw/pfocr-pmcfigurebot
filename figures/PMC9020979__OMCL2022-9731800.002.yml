caption: Low-concentration TBHP stimulation inhibits PREP expression by activating
  PI3K signaling pathway in NPs. (a) The expression of PREP in NP cells was analyzed
  by qRT-PCR. (b) Western blotting for the expression of PREP and PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathway-related proteins. (c) Quantitative analysis of the protein contents of AKT,
  p-AKT, PI3K, p-PI3K, and PREP. Results are shown as mean ± SD, n = 5, ∗∗P < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001. (d) Immunofluorescence images of PREP in human NP cells with or without
  LY294002 treatment. Scale bar, 50 μm. (e) Western blotting for the protein levels
  of AKT, p-AKT, and PREP. (f) Quantitative analysis of the protein contents of AKT,
  p-AKT, and PREP. Results are shown as mean ± SD, n = 5, ∗∗∗P < 0.001. (g) Immunofluorescence
  images of PREP in human NP cells with or without 740 Y-P treatment. Scale bar, 50 μm.
