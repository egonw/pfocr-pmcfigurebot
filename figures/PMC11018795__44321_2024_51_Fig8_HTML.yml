figure_title: Schematic showing the proposed interaction of NAMPT and PD-L1 and their
  dual targeting by LZFPN-90
caption: (Left) Inhibition of PD-1/PD-L1 interactions induces NAMPT expression through
  the HIF-1Î±/glycolysis pathway. (Middle) Inhibition of NAMPT promotes PD-L1 expression
  by regulating SIRT epigenetics. (Right) LZFPN-90 hinders PD-1/PD-L1 interactions
  and NAMPT activity and affects multiple malignant phenotypes.
