caption: The regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis in MASLD and its effects on the
  progression of MASLD. Cystine enters the cell via SLC7A11 and SLC3A2 embedded in
  the surface of the cell membrane and is then oxidized to cysteine, which is catalytically
  synthesized into GSH.GPX4 utilizes the ability of GSH to convert lipid peroxidation
  of L-OOH to L-OH, losing its peroxidative activity and thus protecting against the
  induction of ferroptosis. Nrf2 inhibits ferroptosis by regulating GPX4 and iron
  metabolism. PUFA binds to phosphatidylethanolamine(PE) to form polyunsaturated fatty
  acids phospholipids, the latter of which are susceptible to lipoxygenase(LOX)-mediated
  free radical-induced oxidation that induces ferroptosis. Fe3 + is uptaken by TFR1,
  reduced to Fe2 + by STEAP3, and later transported into the cytoplasmic unstable
  iron pool (LIP), a regulator of iron metabolism, and two proteins in the family
  of zinc-iron-modulated proteins (ZIP8/14), however, in the presence of excess Fe2+,
  can induce cellular ferroptosis by increasing reactive oxygen species generation
  and promoting lipid peroxidation formation via the fenton pathway. GSH, glutathione;
  GPX4, glutathione peroxidase 4; Nrf2, nuclear erythroid-related factor 2; PUMA,
  P53-up-regulated modulator of apoptosis; TFR1, transferrin receptor 1 P53-up-regulated
  modulator of apoptosis; TFR1, transferrin receptor 1
