caption: Gear shifting of different pathways at different relative pathway activities
  . (a) Simulated ATP synthesis flux through a dual pathway (pathways 1 and 2 with
  two different ATP stoichiometries) as function of force ratio at various relative
  pathway capacities. (b) The fractional flux through pathways with two different
  ATP stoichiometries when varying the force ratio X under different  (1, 0.375).
  (c) The fractional flux through pathways with two different ATP stoichiometries
  when varying the force ratio X at different  (0.25, 0). In these simulations, both  and  varied
  as a function of , which was kept constant at any of four values, while  was varied.
  Equation (9) was used for the simulation of  as function of force ratio . Equations
  (3) and (9) were used for the calculation of ; Equations (5) and (9) were used for
  the calculation of . In these simulations,  = 1 and  = 3,  = 1,  = 1, , whilst for
  (a) four values of  (1, 0.375, 0.25, and 0) were used.  is the catalytic activity
  of pathway 2 as compared to the catalytic capacity of the two combined.
