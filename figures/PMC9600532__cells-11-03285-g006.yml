caption: 'The PI3K/Akt pathway is involved in apelin-induced motility of prostate
  cancer cells. (A–H) Cells were applied with inhibitors of PI3K (LY294002; 2 μM)
  and Akt (2 μM), or transfected with PI3K and Akt siRNAs, then applied with apelin,
  before examining cell migration (n = 4) and invasion (n = 4), TIMP2 and miR-106a-5p
  expression (n = 4). (I–K) PC3 cells were treated with apelin or pretreated with
  c-Src and PI3K inhibitors then applied with apelin for 30 min, before examining
  PI3K and Akt phosphorylation by Western blot (n = 3). * p < 0.05 compared with the
  control group; # p < 0.05 compared with the apelin-treated group. Dots of bar graph
  means the repeat number of Western blot assay.'
