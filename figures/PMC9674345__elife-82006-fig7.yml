figure_title: Gene and pathway correlation analyses of CD44 and NUMB isoforms in patient-derived
  colon cancers
caption: (A) Gene correlation analysis showing the correlation of gene expression
  with CD44s and CD44v6 isoform expression in the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patient
  cohort. Differentially expressed genes from CD44s- (red) and CD44v6-OE (blue) RNAseq
  data are highlighted. (B) Pathway correlation analysis showing the correlation of
  pathway activity CD44 and NUMB isoform expression in the TCGA patient cohort.
