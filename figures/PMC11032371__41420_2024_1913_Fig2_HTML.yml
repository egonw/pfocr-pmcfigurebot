figure_title: N4BP1 is a novel negative regulator of TNFR1 signalling
caption: A Binding of M1-linked HMW Ub species to N4BP1. Immunoprecipitated endogenous
  N4BP1 and total cell lysates upon TNFα (20 ng/ml) treatment for indicated time periods
  were analysed by Western blotting with indicated antibodies. B Effect of N4BP1 on
  nuclear translocation of p65 upon TNFα stimulation. Sixteen hours post-starvation,
  N4BP1+/+ and N4BP1−/− MEFs were treated with TNFα (20 ng/ml) for 10 min. Localization
  of p65 was detected by indirect immunofluorescence using anti-p65 antibody (1st
  and 4th column). Nucleoli were stained with DAPI (2nd and 5th column). C The effect
  of N4BP1 on activation of TNFα-mediated NFκB pathway. After 16 h of serum starvation,
  N4BP1+/+ and N4BP1−/− MEFs were treated with TNFα (20 ng/ml) for indicated time
  periods. Total cell lysates were analysed by Western blotting with indicated antibodies.
  D Analysis of N4BP1 interaction with TNFR1-SC complex. After 16 h starvation, N4BP1+/+
  MEFs were stimulated with recombinant HS-TNFα (1 μg/ml, 5 min) and TNFα-bound signalling
  complex was pulled down with Strep-tactin resins and subsequently resolved and analysed
  by Western blotting with indicated antibodies. E The effect of linear Ub binding-deficient
  N4BP1 on NFκB transcriptional activity. N4BP1−/− MEFs stably expressing either empty
  vector, HA-N4BP1 (1-893) or HA-N4BP1 (1-893, F862G/P863A) were transiently transfected
  with pNFκB-Luc and pUT651 plasmids encoding luciferase and β-galactosidase, respectively.
  After 24 h, cells were starved for 16 h, followed by 6 h stimulation with TNFα (20 ng/ml).
  Lysates were subjected to luciferase and β-galactosidase assays. Three independent
  experimental replicates consisting of technical duplicates were performed. Results
  are shown as means and s.e.m. (n = 3). n.s. no statistically significant difference,
  *P < 0.05 and ****P < 0.0001, determined by two-way ANOVA test post hoc Sidak’s
  multiple comparisons test.
