caption: Top1 inhibition by CPT induces cell dysfunctions in healthy CD4 T cells via
  dysregulating the cGAS-STING pathway. (A) mRNA levels of cGAS/STING-related signaling
  genes were determined by real-time RT-qPCR in HS-CD4 T cells treated with CPT (5
  μM) or DMSO for 24 h (n=9). (B) Cytokine array profile in cultured media of HS-CD4
  T cells treated with CPT (5 μM) or DMSO for 48 h. Summary cytokine array data of
  IL-8 and TNFα in cultured media of HS-CD4 T cells treated with CPT (5 μM) or DMSO
  for 48 h and 72 h (n=5). (C) Representative dot plots and summary data of flow cytometry
  analysis of IL-2 and IFN-γ expression in HS-CD4 T cells treated with CPT (5 μM)
  or DMSO for 3 h, 6 h, and 48 h (n=4). (D) Protein levels of cGAS-STING-related signaling
  genes in HS-CD4 T cells treated with CPT (2 μM or 5 µM) or DMSO for 24 h, determined
  by Western blot. (E) Confocal microscopy images showing cGAS (green) and MitoTracker
  (mt, red) and their co-localization (yellow) in HS-CD4 T cells treated with CPT
  (5 μM) or DMSO for 24 h. F, G) Representative Western blots and summary data showing
  cGAS expression in the mitochondria (n=7) or cytosol (n=9) from HS-CD4 T cells treated
  with CPT (5 μM) or DMSO for 24 h. *p < 0.05, ** < 0.01, ***p < 0.001; ns, no significance.
