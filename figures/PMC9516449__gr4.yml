caption: 'Isoginkgetin activates Nrf2/ARE signaling and protects against mitochondrial
  abnormalities in the obese mice. (A) Volcano plot shows the differentially expressed
  genes in the obese heart with IGK treatment compared with that of vehicle treatment.
  (B) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of the differentially
  upregulated genes in IGK-treated obese mice. (C–D) Myocardial protein Nrf2, HO-1,
  NQO1 and GSTP1 were determined by Western blot analysis and quantified below (n = 6
  per group). (E–F) Representative images and analysis of dihydroethidium (DHE) staining
  of cardiac section in mice. Scale bars: 100 μm, n = 6 per group. (G–H) Representative
  images and analysis of MitoSox staining of cardiac section in mice. Scale bars:
  100 μm, n = 6 per group. (I) Representative immunoblotting images of ETC complex
  subunits from indicated groups. (J) ATP content in the heart tissues from indicated
  groups. (n = 3 for each group). (K) Representative transmission electron microscopy
  images of heart tissue from indicated groups. Scale bars: 2 μm (upper) or 500 nm
  (lower). (L) Quantification of mitochondria-related parameters. % Mitochondria area
  refers to the ratio of mitochondrial area to image area; mitochondrial/μm2 refers
  to mitochondrial density; % abnormal mitochondria refers to the ratio of abnormal
  mitochondria in hearts. (n = 3 for each group). Data were shown as mean ± SD, *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001 vs. ND group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001,
  ####P < 0.0001 vs. HFD group. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA.'
