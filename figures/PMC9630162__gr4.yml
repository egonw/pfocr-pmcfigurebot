caption: Progression-free survival and overall survival in the expanded PI3K/AKT/PTEN
  pathway-altered subgroup and pathway non-altered subgroupTick marks on plots show
  censoring events. (A) Genetic profile of tumours in each group as identified by
  expanded biomarker testing; two colours indicate that a tumour carried mutations
  in both genes. (B) Progression-free survival in the expanded pathway-altered subgroup.
  (C) Progression-free survival in the expanded pathway non-altered subgroup. (D)
  Overall survival in the expanded pathway-altered subgroup. (E) Overall survival
  in the expanded pathway non-altered subgroup. HR=hazard ratio.
