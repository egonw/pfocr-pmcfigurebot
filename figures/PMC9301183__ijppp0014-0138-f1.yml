caption: Activation of NLRP3 inflammasome by SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs
  by binding of Spike glycoprotein with cell surface receptor ACE2 leading to viral
  internalization, followed by the release of nucleic acid, viral replication and
  synthesis of viral proteins. Infection of SARS-CoV-2 upregulates the NFkB pathway
  leading to increased expression and synthesis of NLRP3 and IL-1β. Viral proteins
  including S, N, E and viroporins interact with NLRP3 and facilitate inflammasome
  assembly via oligomerization, the interaction of NLRP3 with ASC and cleavage of
  caspas1 leading to maturation and release of IL-18 and IL-1β. Ion channels and ion
  flux are also involved in NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Mitochondrial ROS and lysosomal
  degradation further impart NLRP3 inflammasome activation.
