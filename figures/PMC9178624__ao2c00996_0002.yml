caption: 'Roles of the M receptor and RhoA in H2S-generating enzyme CSE and 3-MST
  protein expression and H2S production in rat cerebrovascular endothelial cells.
  (a) Identification of primary cultured rat cerebrovascular endothelial cells. Immunofluorescence
  staining with anti-factor VIII antibody. Factor VIII exhibited green fluorescence
  in the cytoplasm, and the nucleus stained by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)
  presented blue fluorescence. (b) Effect of the M receptor agonist ACh and blocker
  Atr as well as the RhoA agonist U46619 and inhibitor C3TF on CSE and 3-MST protein
  expression (mean ± SD, n = 3). (c) Effects of the CSE inhibitor PPG and the 3-MST
  inhibitor Asp on basic and ACh-increased H2S production (mean ± SD, n = 6). (d)
  Effects of U46619 and C3TF on basic and ACh-increased H2S production (mean ± SD,
  n = 6). ACh: 1 μmol/L, Atr: 1 μmol/L; PPG: 100 μmol/L, Asp: 10 μmol/L, U46619: 100
  nmol/L, C3TF: 1.0 μg/mL. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 vs the control group; #P < 0.05,
  ##P < 0.01 vs the ACh group.'
