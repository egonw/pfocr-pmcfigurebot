caption: Antitumor efficacy and the effect of WK on the MAPK signaling pathway in
  mice with a transplanted tumor. (a) (b) Images of mice in each group and transplanted
  tumors, TIR, and tumor weight of each group. ∗∗P < 0.01 compared to control group,
  which was considered statistically significant. (c) Weight and volume of the transplanted
  tumor in ICR mice. (d) Western blot and densitometric analysis of the expression
  of P-JNK, P-p38, p38, P-ERK1/2, and β-action in ICR mice. ∗P < 0.05,∗∗P < 0.01 compared
  to control group, which was considered statistically significant.
