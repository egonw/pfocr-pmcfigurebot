caption: 'Graphical presentation of the mechanism of cPLA2 in traumatic brain and
  spinal cord injuries.The extracellular signal molecule binds to its corresponding
  G-protein-coupled receptor to activate PLC. PLC cleaves the PIP2 in the cell membrane
  into DAG and IP3 and then activates PKC to cause a cascade reaction, which opens
  the calcium channel of the cell membrane and increases the intracellular calcium
  ion concentration. In addition, a second injury promotes cPLA2 phosphorylation through
  the ras-MAPK signaling pathway. The increased intracellular calcium promotes the
  binding of the C2 domain of cPLA2 to membrane phospholipids. Phosphorylated cPLA2
  hydrolyses membrane phospholipids, producing downstream products (AA, Ly-so, and
  their subsequent metabolites) that trigger neuroinflammation. Phosphorylated cPLA2
  simultaneously binds to the lysosomal membrane, resulting in increased permeability
  of the lysosomal membrane. Lysosomal enzymes (CTSB, CTSD) exosmose to degrade TFAM
  and impair mitochondrial function. Exosmotic lysosomal enzymes break down digestive
  cells and cause neuronal cell death. Damaged lysosomal enzymes prevent the binding
  of lysosomal enzymes to autophagosomes and thus hinder the progress of autophagy.
