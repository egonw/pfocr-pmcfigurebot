figure_title: Activation of HIF1A signaling in early prostatic lesions and its pharmacological
  targeting
caption: (A) UMAP of unsupervised clustering of prostatic cells from PtenL2/L2 and
  Pten(i)pe−/− mice, 3 months AGI, and (B) dot plot depicting cell lineage–specific
  markers. (C) KEGG pathway analysis of genes up-regulated in Pten-null prostatic
  luminal cells. (D) Violin plots depicting the levels of HIF1A signaling–related
  transcripts in luminal-A and -C cells. ***P < 0.001, Wilcoxon rank sum test. (E)
  Representative immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of HIF1A and carbonic anhydrase
  9 (CA-IX) in sections of dorsolateral prostate (DLP) of PtenL2/L2 and Pten(i)pe−/−
  mice 3 months AGI. n = 3 mice per condition. Scale bars, 100 μm. (F) Pimonidazole
  IHC staining in the DLP of PtenL2/L2 and Pten(i)pe−/− mice 3 months AGI. n = 3 mice
  per condition. Scale bars, 100 μm. Prostate weight (G) and representative H&E staining
  (H, left) and cleaved caspase 3 (C3) IHC staining (H, right) of Pten(i)pe−/− mice,
  3 months AGI, treated for 5 days with vehicle (n = 3) or PX-478 (n = 6). *P < 0.05,
  two-tailed t test. Scale bars, 100 μm. Prostate weight (I) and H&E-stained DLP (J)
  of PtenL2/L2 (n = 4 per condition) and Pten(i)pe−/− (n = 6 per condition) mice (10
  months AGI) treated for 28 days with vehicle or PX-478. n.s., not significant, P
  ≥ 0.05; **P < 0.01, two-tailed t test. Scale bars, 100 μm. (K) Quantification of
  Ki-67–positive epithelial cells in the DLP of vehicle- (n = 3) and PX-478–treated
  (n = 4) Pten(i)pe−/− mice, 10 months AGI. Five to 10 images per prostatic section
  were analyzed. *P < 0.05, two-tailed t test.
