caption: 'ST water extract promoted proliferation of HL7702 cells. HL7702 cells were
  incubated with 0–3200 µg/mL ST water extract for 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively.
  (A) Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. (B) The morphology of HL7702 cells
  was observed using reverse-phase microscope (×10). Scale bar: 20 μm. HL7702 cells
  were treated with 50, 200, 800 µg/mL ST water extract for 72 h. (C) Cell proliferation
  was observed by EdU staining (×10). Scale bar: 50 μm. (D) Quantification of cell
  proliferation. (E) BrdU content was measured using BrdU ELISA assay. Data were presented
  as mean ± SD. of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 vs control
  group.'
