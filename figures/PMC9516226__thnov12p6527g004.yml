caption: Subset of endometrial epithelial cell, EC1, is diminished in the endometrium
  of RIF patients. (A) t-SNE map of four sub-clusters (Ciliated-EC, EC1, EC2, and
  EC3) of EC. (B) Significant gene markers (listed in the ) for each cluster in the
  EC were selected to perform GO analysis. The GO terms with P < 0.05 are shown. Gene
  number of each GO term is listed on the left. P value is shown as -log 10 (P value).
  (C) Bubble diagram showing average expression of selected genes (progesterone receptor
  signaling pathway, autophagy and exosomes-related genes) for the four sub-clusters
  of EC. (D) The PPI network of selected genes in (C). Different edges color presented
  different interactions.
