caption: Analysis of the lignin biosynthetic pathways of BG and SG capsules. (A) Map
  showing the lignin biosynthetic pathway for patterns of DEGs. Expression of lignin-related
  genes is shown by a heatmap using log10 (FPKM); red represents upregulation, and
  blue represents downregulation. (B) Coexpression network of lignin biosynthesis
  end products, upregulated DEGs, and transcription factors.
article_title: Transcriptome and metabolome analyses provide insights into the relevance
  of pericarp thickness variations in Camellia drupifera and Camellia oleifera .
