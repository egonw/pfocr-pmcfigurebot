caption: Cas 3 inhibition promoted double-strand break (DSB) repair in HF cells, and
  PARP1 inhibition promoted activation of the Cyto c/Cas 3 pathway. (a–m) The results
  of western blot showed that the marker of DNA break γH2AX was upregulated in mice
  treated with inhibitors. Expression of 116 kDa PARP1 and PAR in the hair follicle
  was increased in mice treated with Ac, followed by the DNA repair proteins, while
  AIF translocation was enhanced and activation of Cas 3 was weakened. Expression
  of PAR was decreased in mice treated with BMN 673, followed by the DNA repair proteins,
  while expression of Cyto c and activation of Cas 3 were enhanced and AIF translocation
  was weakened. There was no significant change in the expressions of DNA repair proteins,
  except an increase in γH2AX and Cyto c and decrease in KU80 in mice treated with
  both Ac and BMN 673 (Ac+B). (n, o) More NAD+ and NADH were consumed in hair follicles
  in mice treated with Ac, in contrast to the mice treated with BMN 673. ∗P < 0.05,
  ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001.
