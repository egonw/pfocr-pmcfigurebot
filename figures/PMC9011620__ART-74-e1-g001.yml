caption: Diagnostic pathway for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS‐C).
  Moderate‐to‐high consensus was reached by the Task Force in the development of this
  diagnostic pathway for MIS‐C associated with SARS–CoV‐2. 1Due to the difficulty
  in establishing an epidemiologic linkage to a preceding SARS–CoV‐2 infection given
  the evolving COVID‐19 pandemic, the diagnosis of MIS‐C must be determined based
  on the totality of the history, examination, and laboratory studies. Patients may
  have MIS‐C even in the absence of preceding COVID‐19–like illness or a clear history
  of exposure to SARS–CoV‐2, especially in the setting of high community prevalence.
  2Suggestive clinical features include rash (polymorphic, maculopapular, or petechial,
  but not vesicular), gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, abdominal pain, or vomiting),
  oral mucosal changes (red and/or cracked lips, strawberry tongue, or erythema of
  the oropharyngeal mucosa), conjunctivitis (bilateral conjunctival infection without
  exudate), and neurologic symptoms (altered mental status, encephalopathy, focal
  neurologic deficits, meningismus, or papilledema). 3The complete metabolic panel
  (CMP) includes measurement of sodium, potassium, carbon dioxide, chloride, blood
  urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, calcium, albumin, total protein, aspartate aminotransferase,
  alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin. 4Procalcitonin, cytokine
  panel, and blood smear test results should be sent, if available. 5Serologic test
  results should be sent if not sent in Tier 1 evaluation, and if possible, SARS–CoV‐2
  IgG, IgM, and IgA test results should be sent. CRP = C‐reactive protein; ESR = erythrocyte
  sedimentation rate; ALC = absolute lymphocyte count; CBC = complete blood cell count;
  BNP = B‐type natriuretic peptide; PT = prothrombin time; PTT = partial thromboplastin
  time; LDH = lactate dehydrogenase; u/a = urinalysis; EKG = electrocardiogram.
