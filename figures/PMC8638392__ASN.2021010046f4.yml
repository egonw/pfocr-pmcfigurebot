caption: Knockdown of HIF1α by shRNA increases sodium transport and β- and γENaC subunit
  expression levels in cultured CD principal cells. mpkCCDcl4 cells were transduced
  with lentiviruses expressing shRNAs targeting HIF1α (shHIF1α) or scramble shRNA
  (plko). (A and B) Knockdown of HIF1α was assessed by real-time PCR (A) or western
  blot (B) of the different cell lines exposed or not to hypoxia (1% O2). (C) Increased
  transepithelial current in HIF1α-depleted cells (shHIF1α) compared with control
  cells (pLKO). Amiloride-insensitive current was unchanged. Results are means±SEM
  from three independent experiments. (D) Western blot analysis showing that HIF1α
  silencing is associated with increased β- and γENaC abundance. β-actin was used
  as a loading control. A representative experiment from three is shown. (E) Western
  blots were quantified using ImageJ software. Results are expressed as a percentage
  of control values (dots) and are means±SEM (lines) from three experiments in each
  group. (F) Increase in ENaC subunits mRNA levels in response to HIF1α silencing
  assessed by real-time PCR. Bar graphs represent fold of controls (dots) and are
  means±SEM (lines) from three independent experiments. Unpaired Student’s t test
  was used to compare plko and shHIF1α. **P<0.01; ***P<0.001; ****P<0.0001, versus
  plko.
