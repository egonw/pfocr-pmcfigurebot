caption: Lysosomal-associated protein transmembrane 5 (LAPTM5) inhibition improves
  cardiac function at 28 days after myocardial infarction (MI). The mRNA (A) and protein
  (B) expression levels of LAPTM5 in myocardial tissues of all groups of mice. (C)
  Cardiac functional parameters include ejection fraction (EF%), fractional shortening
  (FS%), left ventricular internal dimension at end-diastole (LVIDd), and left ventricular
  internal dimension at systole (LVIDs) were measured after MI by using echocardiography
  assay. (D) Representative images of the 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium (TTC)-stained
  myocardial tissues after MI in all groups of mice and quantification of the infarct
  size. a, b, c, d means sham, MI, MI+LV-shRNA-NC and MI+LV-shRNA-LAPTM5, respectively.
  Statistical evaluation was performed by one-way analysis of variance with Tukey
  post hoc test. Data were expressed as mean ± SD. **P<0.01. n=6 for each group.
