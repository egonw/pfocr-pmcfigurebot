caption: 'Enrichment analysis of the intersection of genes in MetS. (A) Venn diagram
  shows that 108 genes are identified from the intersection of DEGs via Limma and
  yellow module genes via WGCNA. (B) KEGG pathway analysis of the intersection of
  genes. Different colors represent various significant pathways and related enriched
  genes. (C–E) GO analysis of the Intersection of genes, including biological process,
  cellular component, and molecular function, respectively. The y-axis represents
  different GO terms, the x-axis represents gene ratio enriched in relative GO terms,
  the circle size refers to gene numbers, and the color represents p-value. MetS,
  Metabolic syndrome: KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes GO, Gene Ontology:
