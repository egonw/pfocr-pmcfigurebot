caption: PRMT6 loss results in global changes in liver proteome in the presence of
  alcohol. (A) Prmt6 knockout liver macrophages expressing fusion protein of catalytically
  inactive dCas9 and PRMT6 in the presence of indicated guide RNA. Relative mRNA expression
  of indicated genes or negative control (non-target, GFP). N = 3, ns, not significant.
  ∗P < .05, ∗∗P < .01. (B–D) Wild-type (WT) and Prmt6-/- (KO) mice were fed Western
  diet or WD with alcohol in the drinking water (alcohol) for 16 weeks. Livers from
  male mice (N = 3 mice per group) were analyzed by tandem mass tag mass spectrometry
  analysis. (B) Relative protein abundances in control and alcohol conditions. (C)
  Ingenuity pathway analysis of differentially regulated pathways in WT and KO mice
  fed alcohol. (D) Tandem mass tag mass spectrometry analysis of relative peptide
  and protein abundances in WT and Prmt6-/- (KO) mice fed Western diet (control) or
  WD with alcohol in the drinking water (alcohol) for 16 weeks. Fold change in peptide
  abundance was plotted versus fold change in corresponding protein abundance. (E)
  Methylated proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-methyl arginine antibodies.
  Western blot analysis of integrin α4 protein abundance in precipitated fraction
  and in the input. Protein abundance ratios in N = 3 independent experiments. ∗P
  < .05.
