caption: Network for oxidative stress and AKT pathway regulations of cell functions
  in cancer cell treatments. Several AKT effectors are included in this review, such
  as forkhead box transcription factors (FOXO), c-Myc, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF),
  mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1/2 (mTORC1/2), mTOR substrate S6 kinase
  1/2 (S6K1/2), sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), and glycogen
  synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). Several cell functions are included, such as apoptosis,
  autophagy, ER stress, mitochondrial morphogenesis, ferroptosis, necroptosis, DNA
  damage response, senescence, migration, and cell-cycle progression.
