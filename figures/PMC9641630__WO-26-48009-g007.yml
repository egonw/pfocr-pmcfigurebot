caption: 'The effect of quercetin (Q), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), combination 1 (QFH),
  and combination 2 (QFL) on the cyclin D1 level in HCT-116 (A) and Caco-2 (B) cellsData
  are expressed as the mean ±SEM (standard error of mean) of 3 samples each performed
  in triplicate. Data analysis was performed using Graph Pad Prism 8.0.2. Statistically
  significant differences between groups are designated as *p < 0.05 vs. control group,
  #p < 0.05 vs. 5-FU group and Ωp < 0.05 vs. Q group, and ∆p < 0.05 vs. QFL group.'
