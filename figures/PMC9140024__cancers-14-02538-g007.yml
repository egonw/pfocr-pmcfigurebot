caption: Pathway changes associated with Mito-LND treatment in lung adenoma cells.
  In the lung adenoma cells, Mito-LND treatment significantly decreased the expression
  of genes associated with complex I, complex II, OXPHOS and AKT/ mTOR/p70S6K signaling,
  and increased the expression of genes associated with autophagy. In addition, Mito-LND
  treatment significantly decreased cysteine and methionine metabolism, while treatment
  hyperpolarized the mitochondrial membrane potential in lung adenoma cells.
