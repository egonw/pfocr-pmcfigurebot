caption: ITGA5 regulated the biological process of gastric cancer cells by activating
  the FAK/AKT signaling pathway. (a–b) Tissue sequencing results showing that ITGA5
  was involved in the signaling pathways involving focal adhesion kinase (FAK), extracellular
  matrix (ECM), and PI3K-AKT-related pathways. (c) GSEA enrichment analysis revealing
  that ITGA5 abnormal expression was closely associated with FAK. PS = 0.76, P < 0.001,
  FDR < 0.001. (d–e) p-FAK detected by western blot in AGS and MKN-28 cells silenced
  with ITGA5; p-AKT expression was significantly reduced, while FAK and AKT expression
  did not change significantly. (f–g) p-FAK detected in AGS and MKN-28 cells overexpressing
  ITGA5; p-AKT expression was significantly increased, while FAK and AKT did not change
  significantly (∗∗P < 0.01; ∗∗∗P < 0.001 by t-test). High-throughput sequencing and
  bioinformatics data were used to predict the signal pathway and biological process
  involved by ITGA5, and Western Blot was used to further verify the possible mechanism
  of ITGA5 affecting the biological behavior of gastric cancer cells.
