caption: Knockdown of Klotho expression promotes vascular endothelial cell division
  and angiogenesis. (A) Morphological differences of HUVECs in each group under bright
  field. Magnification 400×. scale bar = 30μm. (B) PI staining and flow cytometry
  analysis showed that the proportion of HUVECs in the S phase in the AAV-siKlotho
  group was significantly increased. *P<0.05 vs AAV-siMock group, t test, n=3. (C)
  The experimental results of three-dimensional angiogenesis of the extracellular
  matrix confirmed that HUVECs in the AAV-siKlotho group formed more functional branches.
  *P< 0.05 vs AAV-siMock group, t test, n=3. scale bar = 30μm. (D) Western blot results
  showed that the knockdown of Klotho expression was able to promote the activation
  of the YAP signaling pathway in HUVECs.
