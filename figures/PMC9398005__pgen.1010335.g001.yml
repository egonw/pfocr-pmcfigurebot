figure_title: Variants in the Notch pathway transcription factor associated with Adams
  Oliver Syndrome
caption: 'A. Overview of the Notch signaling pathway. Signal sending cells that express
  Notch ligands (DSL) interact with adjacent signal receiving cells that express Notch
  receptors. Upon receptor-ligand binding, the Notch receptor is cleaved by Î³-secretase,
  resulting in the release of the soluble Notch Intracellular Domain (NICD). NICD
  binds to the CSL transcription factor and recruits the co-activator Mastermind (MAM)
  to activate transcription of Notch target genes. The CSL transcription factor can
  also engage co-repressors (CoR) to inhibit transcription. B. Sequence traces from
  PCR amplified genomic DNA isolated from flies heterozygous for the Su(H)T4 and Su(H)O5
  alleles reveal missense mutations (arrows) in each respective fly line. C. Top:
  Linear domain layout of CSL. NTD = N-terminal domain, BTD = beta-trefoil domain,
  CTD = C-terminal domain. Grey regions are disordered and poorly conserved between
  species. Bottom: Multiple sequence alignments of a portion of the human, mouse,
  and Drosophila NTD of CSL with residues that are 100% conserved highlighted in cyan.
  Yellow highlighting indicates the residues altered due to missense variants in two
  separate families with AOS (specific amino acid changes listed in red text) and
  the missense variants found in the Su(H) alleles (specific amino acid changes listed
  in green text). D. Middle: Ribbon diagram of RBPJ bound to DNA (PDBID 3IAG) [],
  with the same domain coloring as described in C and the DNA shown in purple. Left:
  Close up view of the K169/195/243 residue in yellow, numbered according to human
  (red), mouse (blue), and Drosophila (green) respectively. Right: Close up view of
  the E63/89/137 and K58/84/132 residues in yellow, numbered according to the human
  (red), mouse (blue), and Drosophila proteins respectively. Black dashed lines indicate
  hydrogen bonding.'
