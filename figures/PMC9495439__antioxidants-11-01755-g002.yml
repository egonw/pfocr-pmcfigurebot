caption: MP fraction activated NRF2 signaling pathway in HaCaT cells. (a) HaCaT cells
  were treated with MP fraction for 18 h. Cells were harvested for immunoblot analysis.
  (b) HaCaT cells were treated with MP fraction treatment for 2 to 24 h. The protein
  expression level of NRF2 was determined by immunoblot. (c,d) HaCaT cells were treated
  with MP fraction for 18 h for QPCR assay. DMSO solvent control was used as 1. Data
  are expressed as normalized mRNA levels and presented as mean Â± SD. (e) HO-1 protein
  expression was determined by immunoblot following MP fraction treatment for 2 to
  24 h. The asterisk (*) indicates a significant difference from the solvent control
  cells. (*** p < 0.001, one-way ANOVA).
