caption: 'Overview of the clinical implications of germline variants in PDAC patients
  and at-risk subjects. Pathogenic germline variants are of key interest in PDAC owing
  to their therapeutic actionability and implications for cancer prevention (downstream
  identification of at-risk relatives and possible hereditary cancer syndromes previously
  unknown in the family). Red arrow: pathway of healthy individuals at risk of PDAC
  based on family history. Blue arrow: pathway of patients with PDAC who should be
  tested for germline variants at diagnosis, regardless of family history. Complementary
  somatic analysis of tumor tissue may help the therapeutic decision (not standard
  recommendation, only in the research context). MMR-D: mismatch repair-deficiency;
  MSI-H: microsatellite instabilityâ€“high; PARPi: poly-ADP (adenosine diphosphate)-ribose
  polymerase inhibitors; ICI: immune checkpoint inhibitors.'
