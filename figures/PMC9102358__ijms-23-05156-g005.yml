caption: 'RNase 7 affected the secretion of inflammatory cytokines in UPEC-infected
  bladder cells. After treatment with different concentrations of RNase 7 (1, 5, and
  25 μg/mL) and 15 mM glucose for 24 h, the release levels of cytokines IL−8, IL−10,
  IL−1β, and IL−6 from UPEC-infected SV-HUC-1 cells were measured using CBA. Cells
  infected with UPEC alone (MOI:1:100) were used as positive controls. The definitions
  of each letter/number represented by the X axis are: U: UPEC infection alone; G:
  with 15 mM glucose pretreatment alone; 1, 5, and 25: pretreated with 1, 5, and 25
  μg/mL RNase 7, respectively, + 15 mM glucose. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD
  of three independent experiments. * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001, compared
  to UPEC infection control groups. ## p < 0.01, #### p < 0.0001, compared between
  the two groups.'
