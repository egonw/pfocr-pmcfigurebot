caption: The overall signalling pathway. ERα-induced effects of oestrogen promote
  the expression of NRF2 by the binding of ERα to the NRF2 promoter at the site between
  − 1434 and − 1417 bp. The ERα-NRF2 signalling axis enhances the sensitivity of prostate
  cancer cells to bicalutamide by promoting the expression of resistance-related genes

  cancer.
