caption: 'BA reduced the expression of CysLT1 mRNA, CysLT1, and α-SMA in lung tissue
  and type II AEC cells: (a) BA reduced the expression of CysLT1 mRNA in mice lung
  tissues and type II AEC cells and (b) and (c) BA reduced the expression of CysLT1
  and α-SMA protein in mice lung tissues and type II AEC cells. IR: irradiation, BA:
  baicalin, DXM: dexamethasone, and LTD4: 150 nM LTD4-induced type II AEC cells. Compared
  with the control group, ▲P < 0.05 and ▲▲P < 0.01; compared with the IR or LTD4 group,
  #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01; and compared with the LTD4 + BA 80 μg/mL group, ★P < 0.05
  and ★★P < 0.01. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD (n = 3) and were analyzed by
  one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey analysis.'
