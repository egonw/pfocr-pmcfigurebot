caption: 'The relationship between LINC01268 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition in gastric cancer. A: The expression level of PIK3CA in the LINC01268high
  gastric cancer (GC) tissues was significantly higher than that in the LINC01268lowcancer
  tissues; B: The expression level of Akt in the LINC01268high GC tissues was higher
  than that in the LINC01268lowcancer tissues, but there was no statistical difference.
  Expression levels were normalized to ACTB levels. The results were shown as the
  mean ± SEM; C-E: After knocking down LINC01268, the p-MARCKS, p-PI3K, p-Akt and
  p-β-catenin protein levels were down-regulated in MGC80-3 and AGS cells, but the
  protein level of MARCKS had no significant change. Expression levels were normalized
  to GAPDH levels; F-H: Knocking down LINC01268 reduced vimentin, MMP-9 and N-cadherin
  protein levels, and increased E-cadherin protein levels in MGC80-3 and AGS cells.
  Expression levels were normalized to GAPDH levels. The results were shown as the
  mean ± SD. bP < 0.01, cP < 0.001, dP < 0.0001, eP > 0.05. MARCKS: Myristoylated
  alanine rich protein kinase C substrate; sh-NC: sh-negative control.'
