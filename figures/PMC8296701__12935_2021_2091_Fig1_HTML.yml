caption: Regulatory role of genistein in cellular pathways. Genistein modulates receptor
  tyrosine kinase (RTKs) signal transduction. It prevents the activation of nuclear
  factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) explicitly either
  by the Akt pathway, Notch pathway, or by P53. It modulates the cell cycle by inhibiting
  cell cycle kinases and up-regulating Cyclin-Dependent Kinase inhibitors (CDKIs).
  It regulates ataxia telangiectasia mutated/F-box protein (ATM/AFR) through p53.
  Genistein also modulates metabolic pathways such as gluconeogenesis via the mTOR
  pathway. It up-regulates the Wnt pathway inhibitors and suppresses signal transduction
  by the Wnt pathway by inhibiting frizzled receptor and low density lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein (LPR) interactions and reduces β-catenin (B-cat) cytoplasmic accumulation.
  Genistein in the figure is depicted by “G’
