caption: Discovered and examined the AMGIO2-related function in prostate cancer. (A)
  Volcano plot for the differentially expressed genes between AMIGO2 high-expression
  group and AMIGO2 low-expression group. Red dots represented up-regulated genes (log2Fold
  change >1 and P value <0.05) and green dots represented down-regulated genes (log2Fold
  change <âˆ’1 and P value <0.05). (B) Pathway analysis using the gene set of differentially
  expressed genes between AMIGO2 high-expression group and AMIGO2 low-expression group.
  (C) GSEA between AMIGO2 high-expression group and low-expression group. (D) Enriched
  gene set that showing the relationship between AMIGO2 high-expression group and
  EMT, interferon gamma response, TNF-alpha signaling via NFKB and KRAS signaling
  pathway. (E) Western blotting of EMT related markers while AMIGO2 down-regulated
  in DU145 cell line (left panel). *, P<0.05. Relative expression of EMT-related markers
  in normal control and AMIGO2 down-regulated in DU145 cell line (right panel). (F)
  Western blotting of EMT-related markers while AMIGO2 down-regulated in PC3 cell
  line (left panel). Relative expression of EMT-related markers in normal control
  and AMIGO2 down-regulated in PC3 cell line (right panel). **, P<0.01; ns, no significance.
  AMIGO2, Adhesion Molecule with Ig Like Domain family 2; NC, negative control; GSEA,
  Gene Set Enrichment Analysis; EMT, epithelial mesenchymal transition; TNF, tumor
  necrosis factor; NFKB, nuclear factor kappa-B; KRAS, V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten ratsarcoma
  viral oncogene homolog.
