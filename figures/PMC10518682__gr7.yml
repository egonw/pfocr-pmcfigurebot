caption: Axonal regeneration-related molecular regulations in the hBMSC-dECM and autograft
  groups. (A) Trends in q-values of combined DEGs enriched for axons, axon guidance,
  and axon extension in the hBMSC-dECM and autograft groups compared with the sham
  group at each time point. (B) Expression and regulatory network of axonal regeneration-related
  genes in the hBMSC-dECM group. A partial display of key gene networks are marked
  with the black box. (C) Expression and regulatory network of axonal regeneration-related
  genes in the autograft group. A large circle represents a GO term and a small circle
  represents a gene. The connecting line indicates the pathway to which the gene belongs.
  Small circles are colored in red to indicate that the gene is upregulated at the
  given time point, and in blue to indicate that the gene is downregulated. Log2FC
  is represented by the depth of shade. Large circles are colored to indicate the
  p-value of the pathway, while their sizes indicate the enrichment factor of the
  pathway (the number of DEGs divided by all genes in the GO term).
