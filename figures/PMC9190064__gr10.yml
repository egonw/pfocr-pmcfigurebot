caption: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis of molecular pathways
  involved in the protection of fullerenol on the UVB exposed hCECs. A) KEGG pathway
  analysis for differently expressed mRNAs. Each node of the green circle represents
  a signaling pathway. Grey linear represents interactive relationships between two
  signaling pathways. Each node of the blue circle represents down-regulated genes
  and the red circle represents up-regulated genes. The red and oval boxes represent
  the pathways and genes that differ the most in this group. B-D) The relative mRNA
  expression of genes associated with the FoxO signaling pathway (B–D) or homologous
  recombination pathway (E-G) which were involved in the protection of fullerenol
  in the UVB irradiated hCECs screened by RNA-Seq. B) FOXO1 mRNA expression. C) PLK3
  mRNA expression. D) PCK2 mRNA expression. E) TOP3A mRNA expression. F) TOP3B mRNA
  expression. G) POLD4 mRNA expression. N = 3 samples per group. Data were expressed
  as the mean ± SEM from three independent experiments. *P < 0.1, ****P < 0.0001 using
  one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey's test. (For interpretation of the references to
  colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this
