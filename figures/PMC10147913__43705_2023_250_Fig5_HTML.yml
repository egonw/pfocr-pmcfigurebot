figure_title: Construction of metabolic cooperation scheme related to amino acid between
  three genotypic groups of L. acetotolerans
caption: The transcription of the last gene in the biosynthesis pathway of related
  amino acid is shown in the frame of different genotypic groups, and the heatmap
  is shown using the log2 fold change value of transcriptional data in coculture compared
  to monoculture. The small pie chart above the heatmap indicates the coculture mode.
article_title: Metabolic cooperation between conspecific genotypic groups contributes
  to bacterial fitness.
