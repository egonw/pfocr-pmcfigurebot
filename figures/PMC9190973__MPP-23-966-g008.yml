caption: Detection of H2O2 at powdery mildew (PM) infection sites after medicarpin
  treatment in R108. (a–f) Representative images of 3,3′‐didiaminobenzidine (DAB)‐stained
  mock (a–c) and 10 µM medicarpin‐treated (d–f) leaves showing H2O2 accumulation as
  a brown precipitate (arrows). Scale bar, 10 µm. c, conidium; a, appressorium, h,
  hypha, HC, primary haustorial complex. (g) Percentage of Erysiphe pisi conidia showing
  different patterns of H2O2 accumulation. (h) H2O2 quantification in mock‐ and 10 µM
  medicarpin‐treated leaves via the potassium iodide colourimetric assay. Data represent
  mean ± SEM of four independent biological replicates. Significant differences were
  computed using unpaired t test (*p ≤ 0.05). (i) Percentage of E. pisi conidia with
  primary haustorium on medicarpin‐treated and control leaves. For (g) and (i), a
  total of 150 infection sites were assessed from five leaflets/treatment
