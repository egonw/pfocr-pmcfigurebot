caption: 'Characteristics of blackcurrant unigenes based on Gene Ontology (GO) categorization
  (A), Clusters of Orthologous Group (KOG) classification (B), and Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways classification (C). The x-axis is the names
  of the 25 KOG group, and the y-axis is the percentage of genes annotated under this
  group of the total annotated genes. The y-axis is the names of the KEGG pathways,
  and the x-axis is the number of genes annotated in the pathway and the ratio between
  the number in this pathway and the total number of annotated genes. The KEGG metabolic
  pathway genes are divided into 5 branches: A: Cellular Processes, B: Environmental
  Information Processing, C: Genetic Information Processing, D: Metabolism, E: Organismal
  Systems.'
