figure_title: Illustration of the mechanism of action of antibody-drug conjugates
  (ADCs). ADCs bind to the surface antigen on tumor cells. Subsequently, ADCs are
  internalized through receptor-medicated endocytosis. ADCs are processed through
  the endosome-lysosome pathway leading to release of the cytotoxic payload and induced
  tumor cell death by attacking DNA or affecting microtubule structure
