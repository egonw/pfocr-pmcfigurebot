caption: 'PAI-1 was validated as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of IBD. (A)
  Representative immunoblot results of PAI-1 and GAPDH expression in colon samples
  from IBD patients and non-IBD controls. (B) Quantification of PAI-1 expression (mean±SEM,
  Student''s t test, n=3, *P≤0.05). (C) Immunohistochemistry images of PAI-1 expression
  in IBD and control cases. (D) PAI-1 plasma concentrations in IBD patients and the
  control cohort measured by ELISA (mean±SEM, Mann‒Whitney test, ****P≤0.0001). (E)
  AUC value of 82.78% (95% CI: 71.89 to 93.67) using PAI-1 levels to distinguish between
  IBD patients and non-IBD controls. (F) An illustration of the role of PAI-1 in the
  pathogenesis of IBD. PAI-1 is expressed in the inflamed epithelium in IBD. It stimulates
  the expression of the chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL5 and the adhesion molecule ICAM-1
  on IECs through activation of the NF-κB pathway. It also affects the balance of
  the gut microbiome. CXCL1 and CXCL5 signal through CXCR2 to recruit neutrophils
  to inflamed tissues and cause ongoing colonic damage and inflammation, which is
  shown by increased expression of IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α. Deficiency in PAI-1 decreases
  the activation of the NF-κB pathway, restores the diversity of the microbiome, reduces
  the expression of neutrophil-specific chemokines and ultimately reduces disease
  severity.'
