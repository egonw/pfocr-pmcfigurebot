caption: LMAN2 expression is related to DNA damage repair. (a) Gene Ontology GO annotation
  analyses revealed the functional enrichment of LMAN2. (b) Plots of enrichment derived
  from GSEA Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). The findings of GSEA showed that ALLOGRAFT_REJECTIOO,
  IL-2_STAT5_SIGNAL and MYC_TARGETS_V1 were differentially enriched in LMAN2-related
  enrichment score (ES), normalized p value (NOM p val), and normalized ES (NES).
  (c) ETV2, GTF2F1, and SPDEF transcriptional regulation of LMAN2 (GRNdb). (d) Predicted
  protein-protein interaction network (GeneMANIA). (e) Predicted protein-protein interaction
  network (DIGGER). (f) Predicted protein-protein interaction network (STRING). (g)
  m6A methylation modifications of RNA may affect LMAN2 expression, which is associated
  with homologous recombination (HR) in the DNA damage repair pathway of LMAN2. Predict
  the mechanistic pattern of LMAN2 in breast cancer.
