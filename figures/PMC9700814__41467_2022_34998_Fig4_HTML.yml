figure_title: GPSM1 deficiency in macrophages increases energy expenditure
caption: a, b Oxygen consumption (VO2) monitored over a 24-h period and shown as averaged
  values in NCD-fed (a, n = 6 biologically independent mice for GPSM1f/f and n = 3
  biologically independent mice for GPSM1f/f; Lyz2-cre) and HFD-fed (b, n = 7 biologically
  independent mice for GPSM1f/f and n = 5 biologically independent mice for GPSM1f/f;
  Lyz2-cre). c Representative images of H&E staining of BAT sections. Scale bars,
  100 μm. d Immunoblots of UCP1 in BAT and quantification (right), n = 3 biologically
  independent mice per condition. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the mRNA abundance
  of the thermogenic markers in BAT of NCD-fed (e, n = 9 biologically independent
  mice per group) and HFD-fed conditions (f, n = 10 biologically independent mice
  per group). The experiments were repeated three times with similar results (c).
  Throughout, all data are presented as means ± SEM. P values are determined by two-way
  ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple-comparisons test (a, b) or unpaired two-tailed Student’s
  t-test (a, b, d–f).
