caption: Inhibition of APOC1 of TAM reduced HCC progression in vitro and in vivo.(A)
  Knockdown of APOC1 was demonstrated by Western blot in TAM cells.(B) CCK8 assay
  of HCC cancer cells with TAM supernatant in different groups.(C)EDU asasy of cancer
  cells with TAM supernatant in different groups.(D) Transwell assay of cancer cells
  with TAM supernatant in different groups.(E) Scratch assay of cancer cells with
  TAM supernatant in different groups.(F)Picture display of the respective group of
  subcutaneous tumors. (G–H) The volume (G) and weight (H) statistics of subcutaneous
  tumors in the respective group. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
article_title: Inhibition of APOC1 promotes the transformation of M2 into M1 macrophages
  via the ferroptosis pathway and enhances anti-PD1 immunotherapy in hepatocellular
  carcinoma based on single-cell RNA sequencing.
