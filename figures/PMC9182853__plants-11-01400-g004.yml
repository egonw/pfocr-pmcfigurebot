caption: Mobile SP6A mediates StSWEET11 function in potato tuberization. (a) Sucrose
  is transported from phloem parenchyma cells (PPC) to companion cells (CC) in the
  source leaves, using the apoplasmic pathway. Sucrose transporters (SUTs) load sucrose
  into sieve elements (SEs) and CCs to establish a high concentration in the phloem.
  Sucrose also can move symplasmically from CCs to SEs through plasmodesmata (PD).
  High levels of sucrose promote SP6A expression in CCs of source leaves; PD-mediated
  intercellular movement of SP6A allows its long-distance trafficking through the
  phloem. (b) In the stolon, sucrose moves symplasmically from SEs to CCs where it
  is then unloaded, via the StSWEET11 permease, into the apoplasm. Sucrose is retrieved
  from the apoplast of parenchyma cells (PCs) by the SUTs. (c) Under tuberization,
  shoot-derived SP6A is unloaded into the stolon CCs where it interacts with StSWEET11
  permeases to block apoplasmic sucrose transport between CCs and tuber parenchyma
  cells (TPCs); thereby, sucrose moves symplasmically from CCs to TPCs. The transition
  of sucrose unloading pathway in TPCs, from apoplasmic to symplasmic, facilitates
  tuberization process under high availability of sucrose. Red small round circles
  indicate sucrose molecules.
