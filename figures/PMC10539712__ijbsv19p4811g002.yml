caption: 'The association of alcohol consumption with the methionine cycle. Methionine
  metabolism primarily occurs in the liver and involves two main components: the transmethylation
  cycle, which generates S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and its subsequent metabolism
  into homocysteine (SAH), and the transsulfuration pathway, which produces reduced
  homocysteine into glutathione (GSH). These processes require the involvement of
  folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12. Drinking alcohol is intricately linked
  to the methionine cycle, which generates methyl groups that serve as substrates
  for DNA and histone methylation in epigenetics. Alcohol consumption can alter epigenetic
  modifications by affecting the intermediates, enzymes, and cofactors involved in
  the methionine cycle. It reduces the levels of folate, methionine, SAM, vitamin
  B6, and vitamin B12 in the body. Ethanol consumption upregulated MAT1A and MAT2A
  gene expression. Folic acid can lead to a decrease in DNMT3a expression, which downregulates
  the methylation level of the forkhead Box P3(FOXP3) promoter region, thereby increasing
  the abundance of FOXP3 expression, an important transcription factor for Treg cells,
  which can alleviate liver inflammatory injury in ALD. 5-MTHF, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate;
