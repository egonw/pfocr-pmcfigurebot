caption: LINC00674 activates the mTOR signaling pathway by regulating NOX1. (A) TCGA
  data analysis by the GEPIA platform indicated a positive correlation between LINC00674
  and NOX1 mRNA levels in HCC tissues. (B and C) The lentivirus mediated shNRA targeting
  NOX1 and non-targeting shRNA (NTC) were transduced into Hep3B and MHCC97H cells.
  WB and RT-qPCR analysis was used to confirm NOX1 mRNA and protein levels. (D) LINC00674-activated
  the mTOR signaling pathway was markedly attenuated by NOX1 knockdown in HCC cells.
  *P<0.05.
