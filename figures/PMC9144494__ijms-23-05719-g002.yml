caption: Individual variation of response to metformin and GLP-1 receptor agonists
  based on pharmacogenomic variants. (A) The variant rs622342 (CC) of the SLC22A1
  gene leads to a decreased activity of the OCT-1 transporter across the cellular
  membrane. OCT-1 transporter is responsible for the intra-hepatic transport of metformin.
  The reduction in metformin amount into these cells may contribute to a minor response
  to the drug. (B) TCF7L2 is involved in the molecular pathway, which facilitates
  the GLP-1-dependent insulin secretion from pancreatic Î²-cells. Its genetic variant
  rs7903146 (T allele) is associated with a positive response to the GLP-1 receptor
  agonist exenatide. This figure was originally created by the authors.
