caption: 'TRIM72 mediates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and lactate production via interactions
  with PPP3CA. (a) Top panel showing Co-IP analysis of BT549 cells using a PPP3CA
  antibody. Lanes from left to right: Input, anti-TRIM72 pull-down, and normal IgG
  pull-down. Representative panels of n = 3 replicates. The bottom panel shows transient
  PPP3CA knockdown by PPP3CA siRNA (siRNA-NC, siRNA-1, siRNA-2, and siRNA-3) in BT549
  cells. The relative mRNA levels of PPP3CA in BT549 cells were determined by RT-qPCR
  at 24 h after transfection (n = 3). (b) The relative protein expression of LDHA
  in BT549 cells was measured by WB. Cells were transfected either with NC vectors
  or with TRIM72-oe plasmid, PPP3CA siRNA-2, and cultured with CoCl2 as hypoxia conditioning
  (n = 3). (c) The lactate concentration in the culture medium was measured using
  ELISA (n = 3). (d) The luciferase activities of MCT4 promoter in TRIM72-oe BT549
  cells after transfection with PPP3CA siRNA-2 (n = 3). (e) Modified BT549 cells were
  treated with PPP3CA siRNA-2 under hypoxia for 24 h, and the protein levels of PI3K,
  Akt, and mTOR and their phosphorylated forms were analyzed by western blotting (n
  = 3). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 indicates a significant difference among
  the indicated groups. Akt, protein kinase B; Co-IP, co-immunoprecipitation; LDHA,
  lactate dehydrogenase A; MCT4, monocarboxylate transporter 4; mTOR, mammalian target
  of rapamycin; NC, negative control; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PPP3CA,
  protein phosphatase 3 catalytic subunit alpha; RT-qPCR, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR;
  TRIM72, tripartite motif-containing 72; WB, western blot.'
