caption: Licoflavone A (LA) suppressed GC cell proliferation in vitro. (a) The root
  of Glycyrrhiza glabra. (b) The chemical structure of LA. (c, d, e, and f) Human
  SGC-7901, MKN-45, MGC-803, and GES-1 cells were treated with LA (0, 6.25, 12.5,
  25, 50, and 100 μM) for 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively (n = 5). Cell viability was
  measured by CCK8 assay. Cell viability is represented in percentage relative absorbance
  compared to the controls. Values are given as the mean ± standard error of the mean
  (SEM) of three independent experiments. ∗p < 0.05 vs. control and ∗∗p < 0.01 vs.
  control.
