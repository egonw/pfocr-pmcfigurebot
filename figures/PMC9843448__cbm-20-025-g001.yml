caption: Mechanisms of pro-angiogenic factors inducing angiogenesis and new potential
  targets inhibiting angiogenesis in HCC. Pro-angiogenic factors secreted by HCC cells,
  including VEGFA, Ang2, FGF2, PDGFA, CXCL12, and TGF-β, bind the receptors expressed
  on ECs and promote angiogenesis in HCC. Hypoxia promotes expression of VEGFA, FGF2,
  and PDGFA in HCC cells. Leptin also promotes VEGFA expression by binding Ob-R in
  HCC cells. VEGFA binds VEGFR2 and subsequently activates the PI3K/AKT and RAF/MAPK
  pathways, thereby promoting angiogenesis. By interacting with FGFR1, FGF2 promotes
  angiogenesis in HCC by activating the RAF/MAPK pathway. PDGFA activates MEK/ERK
  signaling via PDGFR, thus promoting angiogenesis. TGF-β binds CD105 and activates
  the ALK/SMAD1/5 pathway, which promotes angiogenesis. COX2 and VEGFA induced Ang2
  promotes angiogenesis by binding the Tie2 receptor. SOX4 induced CXCL12 promotes
  angiogenesis by binding the CXCR4 receptor. Nvp-bep800 inhibits HSP90β in ECs and
  subsequently attenuates angiogenesis in HCC. AMD3100 inhibits CXCR4 on ECs, thus
  attenuating angiogenesis in HCC. TRC105 inhibits CD105 on ECs and consequently attenuates
  angiogenesis in HCC.
