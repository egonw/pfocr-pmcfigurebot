caption: Schematic illustration of transdermal delivery of PDM via MNs patch for tumor
  immunotherapy. PDM caused tumor cells ICD upon laser irradiation, and the released
  TAAs were captured by PST to facilitate antigens presentation. Meanwhile, the self-activation
  of DZ silenced the Î²-catenin signaling pathway, which in turn promoted DCs infiltration
  via CCL4 excretion. Then, the matured DCs prime T cells leading to the activation
  of the adaptive immune response.
