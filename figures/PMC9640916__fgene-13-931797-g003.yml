caption: 'Screening for target mRNA with decreasing expression from the anagen to
  telogen phase in murine hair follicle cycle. (A) Construction of the miRNA-mRNA
  network. The miRNA-mRNA interactions were experimentally validated in previous studies.
  (B) The GO enrichment analysis of target mRNAs on biological processes, cellular
  component, and molecular function. (C) The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of target
  mRNAs. (D) The PPI network analysis of target mRNAs. (E) Volcano plot shows differentially
  expressed mRNAs between telogen and anagen phases in the GSE1912 data set. (F) The
  intersection of downregulated mRNAs and target mRNAs. (G) Heatmap shows target mRNAs
  with decreasing expression from the anagen to telogen phase in the GSE1912 data
  set. (H) Validation of identified target mRNAs with a decrease in expression using
  another data set: GSE11186. The expression of Atp6v1a, Cacna2d3, Cdkn1a, Gadd45a,
  Gspt1, Mafb, Mitf, Notch1, Plk2, Runx1, Slc7a5, and Sox5 at P23-P44 of murine hair
  follicle cycle. (I) Validation of screened target mRNAs using RT-qPCR. The expression
  of Atp6v1a, Cacna2d3, Cdkn1a, Gadd45a, Gspt1, Mafb, Mitf, Notch1, Plk2, and Slc7a5
  at different stages of murine hair follicle cycle. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***,
