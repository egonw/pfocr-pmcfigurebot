caption: 'Signaling through TBK1/IKKε and IFNAR promotes kidney injury in folic acid-induced
  nephropathy. (A–H) Functional relevance of and IFNAR in the folic acid nephropathy
  (FAN) model. (A) Study design. Mice were pretreated with amlexanox (AMX), vehicle
  or anti-IFNAR neutralizing antibodies before folic acid administration. A second
  dose of anti-IFNAR was administered at 24 h. (B–D) Impact of IFNAR blockade in FAN.
  (B) qRT-PCR showed lower kidney expression of representative proinflammatory cytokines
  (Ccl2, Cxcl10, Il1β, Tnf) in mice with FAN and IFNAR blockade. (C) Kidney infiltration
  by F4/80 + mononuclear phagocytes. (D) TUNEL+ dead cells. Mean ± SEM. p < 0.05 vs
  Control, #p < 0.05 vs FAN (n = 4-8 mice per group). (E–H) Impact of TBK1/IKKε targeting
  by AMX in FAN. AMX decreased plasma urea levels (E), infiltration by F4/80 + mononuclear
  phagocytes (F), MPO + neutrophiles (G), and the number of TUNEL+ dead cells (H)
  in kidneys from mice with FAN. Mean ± SEM. *p ≤ 0.05 vs control; #p ≤ 0.05 vs FAN;
  n = 4-6 mice per group.'
