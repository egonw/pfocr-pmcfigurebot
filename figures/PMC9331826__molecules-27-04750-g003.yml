caption: 'Mechanism of EMT-mediated targeting and immunotherapy resistance: Tumor-associated
  genes can induce EMT-mediated tumor cell targeting and immunotherapy resistance.
  LINC00460 can competitively inhibit the expression of Mir-149-5p and induce EMT
  by regulating the expression of IL-6, thus mediating gefitinib resistance. Mir-625-3p
  inhibited the expression of target gene AXL and activated the TGF-β/Smad signaling
  pathway to induce EMT. Mir-141-3p can inhibit the expression of target gene EGFR
  and induce EMT, thus mediating the resistance of gefitinib and cetuximab. Tumor-associated
  proteins (Oct4, Nanog, and TGF-β1) can induce EMT through related signaling pathways
  (Wnt/β-catenin and ITGβ3) and mediate gefitinib resistance. Tumor-associated proteins
  (TNF-α, TGF-β1, and DCLK1) can induce EMT through related signaling pathways (NF-κB
  and YAP), thereby mediating immunotherapy resistance.'
