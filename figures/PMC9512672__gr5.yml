caption: Assessment of common proteins across different patientsNested and Edward’s
  Venn diagrams visualize the number of shared and differentially expressed EC proteins
  that are not found in the healthy controls in 8 patients with grade 1 EC and 6 patients
  with grade 2 EC , respectively.(A) GCA (circled in red) was one of the frequently
  detected proteins from six out of eight patients with grade 1 EC.(B) MRTO4, HM13,
  PSMB9, TMED7 (circled in green), and GFPT1 (circled in red) were commonly identified
  in five out of six patients with grade 2 EC.(C) Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA)
  highlights the common top 10 canonical pathways significantly altered and detected
  across 20 patients with EC.
