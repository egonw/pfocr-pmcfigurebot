caption: Econazole and Adriamycin induced apoptosis in ADR and sensitive breast cancer
  cell lines. A. Econazole (3 μM), Adriamycin (3 μM), and the combination of Econazole
  (3 μM) with Adriamycin (3 μM) treatment (24 hours) induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231/ADR
  and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Apoptosis was measured by Annexin V/PI staining
  and flow cytometry (P<0.05). B. The quantitative results of A. C. Econazole (3 μM),
  Adriamycin (3 μM), and the combination of Econazole (3 μM) with Adriamycin (3 μM)
  treatment (24 hours) induced apoptosis in MCF-7/ADR and MCF-7 breast cancer cells.
  Apoptosis was measured by An-nexin V/PI staining and flow cytometry (P<0.05). D.
  The quantitative results of C.
article_title: Econazole nitrate reversed the resistance of breast cancer cells to
  Adriamycin through inhibiting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
