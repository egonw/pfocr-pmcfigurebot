caption: NAA10 expression level is closely associated with Pirh2‐p53 signalling pathway.
  (A) NAA10 gene expression profile was analysed after the stable interference of
  CAL 27 cells, and genes with differential expression of more than two folds were
  selected for KEGG analysis. The top 10 KEGG pathways were displayed. (B) GSEA result
  showed that high NAA10 expression was positively correlated with p53 signalling
  in OSCC. NES, normalized enrichment score. (C) Differentially expressed genes of
  P53 signalling affected by NAA10 silencing in CAL 27 cells. The colour intensity
  was proportional to the log2 of expression ratio (blue, downregulated; red, upregulated).
  (D) Expression levels of selected genes in P53 pathway were examined by qRT‐PCR
  in CAL 27 cells. Each bar represents the mean ± SD from three independent experiments
