caption: The influence of recombinant arresten and canstatin on HUVEC migration. (A)
  Assessment of the migration ability using wound healing test. (B) The Transwell
  assay indicates that arresten and canstatin significantly inhibited the HUVECs migration
  and shows the images obtained with a microscope at 100× g magnification. (C,D) The
  result of wound healing (24 h) and migration (36 h) is represented as the relative
  cell migration rate. (E) Tube formation assay of HUVECs. (F,G) total length and
  junction number of HUVEC tube formation after 12 h of recombinant arresten and canstatin
  treatment. Cells were treated with 20 μg/mL of arresten and canstatin proteins for
  24 h, respectively. Scale bars, 200 μm. Data are expressed as the mean ± standard
  deviation of triplicate experiments. * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 indicate a significant
  difference compared to the control.
