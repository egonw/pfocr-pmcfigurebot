caption: CCDC-PA inhibited the cell proliferation of SCC4 cells treated with CCDC-PA
  at various stoichiometric ratios at 24 h and 48 h. (A) Bright-field and immunofluorescence
  images of HSC-3 and SCC4 cells. (B) The cell proliferation of HSC-3 and SCC4 cells
  was determined by CCK-8 assay. Control indicates a condition without treatment of
  CCDC-PA. 1:20, 1:10, 1:5 1:2, and 1:1 indicate the final concentration of PA in
  the CCDC system is equivalent to 2.5, 5.0, 10, 25, and 50 µg/mL respectively. Data
  are expressed as mean ± S.D. (n = 3), with *P< 0.05 indicating the significant difference
  from the controls.
