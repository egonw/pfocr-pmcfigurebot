caption: 'Effects of SeNPs on the PERK and AMPK signaling pathways. (a) The protein
  expression level of GRP78 was detected by Western blot analysis. (b) The expression
  levels of PERK signaling pathway were detected by Western blot analysis. (c) The
  expression levels of p-AMPK, AMPK, mTOR, and p-mTOR were detected by Western blot
  analysis. (d) The expression levels of ULK1, Beclin1, and SQSTM1 were detected by
  Western blot analysis. (e) The expression level of LC3B-II/LC3B-I was detected by
  Western blot analysis. (f) The expression level of PINK1 and Parkin was detected
  by Western blot analysis. All data are presented as the mean ± SEM of three independent
  experiments. ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01. SeNPs: selenium nanoparticles; TM: tunicamycin;
  XBP1: X-box binding protein 1; GRP78: glucose-regulated protein 78; PERK: protein
  kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase; eIF2α: eukaryotic initiation factor
  2; ATF4: activating transcription factor 4; AMPK: AMP-activated kinase; mTOR: mechanistic
  target of rapamycin, ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy; SQSYM1: sequestosome-1; LC3B:
  microtubule-associated protein light chain 3; PINK1: PTEN-induced kinase 1.'
