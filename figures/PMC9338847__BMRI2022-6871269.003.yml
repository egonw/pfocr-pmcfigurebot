caption: Mechanical stretch activates the Rho/ROCK1/NF-κB signaling pathway in RAW264.7
  macrophages. Protein expression of GAPDH, RhoA, ROCK1, and ROCK2 was analyzed by
  Western blotting after 5%, 10%, and 15% elongation mechanical stretch for 8 h. Control
  indicates cells were cultured at static condition. The results are expressed as
  the means ± SD (n = 3). Compare to control, ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01.
