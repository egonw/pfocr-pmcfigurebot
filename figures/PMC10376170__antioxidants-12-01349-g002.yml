caption: Mechanisms of action of carnosol against TNBC. Carnosol inhibits the cellular
  proliferation of TNBC by blocking the cell cycle at G2 phase via the upregulation
  of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. Carnosol stimulates ROS generation,
  leading to the activation of p38MAPK. Activated p38MAPK induces ER stress and activates
  the unfolded protein response (UPR) response pathway sensors IRE1Î± and ATF-6. Consequently,
  proteins such as mTOR, p300, PCAF, and STAT3 are targeted for proteasome degradation.
  The degradation of mTOR leads to the induction of excessive autophagy, which ultimately
  triggers autophagy-dependent cell death. ROS also activates, through a p38-independent
  mechanism, the PERK-ATF4-CHOP sensor, which might contribute to the activation of
  the intrinsic apoptosis pathway by inducing pro-apoptotic genes and downregulating
  the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. CHOP could also contribute to the activation of
  the extrinsic pathway by upregulating the expression of death receptors. Excessive
  generation of ROS by prolonged exposure to carnosol leads to oxidative DNA damage
  that could also contribute to the activation of the programmed cell death pathways.
  Carnosol could also suppress TNBC migration and invasion through inhibition of the
  STAT3 pathway, leading to downregulation of MMP-9. Inhibition of the STAT3 pathway
  involves the targeting of STAT3 protein to proteasome degradation by the ROS-p38MAPK-ER
  stress cascade. Carnosol-mediated downregulation of p300 and PCAF protein levels,
  along with the resulting histone hypoacetylation, might also contribute to the inhibition
  of tumor growth and metastasis in triple-negative breast cancer.
