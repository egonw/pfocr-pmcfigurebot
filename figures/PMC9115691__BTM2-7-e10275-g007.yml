caption: 'miR‐23a‐3p mediated LINC00473‐activated LRP5/Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway
  axis in the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. (a) Efficiency
  of transfection in hBMSCs for miR‐23a‐3p and LINC00473 under a fluorescence microscope
  (scale bar = 1000 μm). (b) Efficiency of transfection in hBMSCs for miR‐23a‐3p determined
  by qRT‐PCR analysis. (c) ALP staining for osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs under
  an inverted phase contrast microscope (scale bar = 1000 μm). (d) ALP activity assay
  for osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. (e) qRT‐PCR showing the mRNA expression
  levels of BSPII, OPN3, and Runx‐2 in each group. (f) qRT‐PCR showing the mRNA expression
  levels of β‐catenin, LRP5, and TCF1 in each group under osteogenic stimulation.
  (g) Western blotting showing the protein expression levels of BSPII, OPN3, Runx‐2,
  β‐catenin, LRP5, and TCF1 in each group under osteogenic stimulation. (h,i) The
  quantification of integrated density in target bands normalized to GAPDH. (j) Oil
  red O staining for adipogenic differentiation of hBMSCs under an inverted phase
  contrast microscope (scale bar = 400 μm). (k) Cellular TG content assay for adipogenic
  differentiation of hBMSCs. (l) qRT‐PCR showing the mRNA expression levels of PPAR‐γ,
  CEBP‐α, and FABP4 in each group. (m) qRT‐PCR showing the mRNA expression levels
  of β‐catenin, LRP5, and TCF1 in each group under adipogenic stimulation (AS). (n)
  Western blotting showing the protein expression levels of PPAR‐γ, CEBP‐α, FABP4,
  β‐catenin, LRP5, and TCF1 in each group under adipogenic stimulation (AS). (o,p)
  The quantification of integrated density in target bands normalized to GAPDH. Data
  are presented as mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments. (b)
  **P < 0.01 compared with the Control group and miR‐NC group. (d–f,h,i) **P < 0.01
  compared with the OS group and OS + Vector group, and ##P < 0.01 compared with the
  OS + up‐LINC00473 group and OS + up‐LINC00473 + miR‐NC group. (k–m,o,p) **P < 0.01
  compared with the AS group and AS + Vector group, and ##P < 0.01 compared with the
  AS + up‐LINC00473 group and AS + up‐LINC00473 + miR‐NC group. ALP, alkaline phosphatase;
