caption: 'Rapamycin protects against TNBS-induced colitis in mice. (a) After being
  treated with TNBS (100 μl of 2.0%), mice were gavaged with rapamycin (3 mg/kg/day)
  or saline (100 μl) for 7 days. Disease activity index (DAI) scores were used to
  evaluate the severity of colitis. The DAI was determined by scoring changes in weight,
  hemoccult positivity, or blood trace and stool consistency. ∗TNBS vs. control; #TNBS+Rapa
  vs. TNBS+saline. ∗∗P < 0.01,  ∗∗∗P < 0.001,  #P < 0.05,  ##P < 0.01, and###P < 0.001.
  (b) H&E staining was used to examine the histological changes of colonic mucosa
  (×100). (c) The histological scores were calculated to evaluate the severity of
  colonic mucosa inflammation (n = 5 per group, ∗∗P < 0.01).'
