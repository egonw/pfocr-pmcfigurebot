caption: DJ-1 mediates the resistance of OS cells to Adriamycin-induced apoptosis.
  (A, B). After 24-h treatment with different concentrations of Adriamycin, the viabilities
  of MG63 and U2OS cells with DJ-1 overexpression or knockdown was detected and compared.
  (C). WB results indicated that up-regulation of DJ-1 could reduce the expression
  of Bax and cleave caspase-3 activity in OS cells. (D). Annexin V/PI double-staining
  assay showed that DJ-1 down-regulation aggravated OS cell apoptosis. The Original
  uncut western bands are shown in . n = 3 per group. **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
