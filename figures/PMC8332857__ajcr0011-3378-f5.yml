caption: ZNF217 initiates therapeutic resistance via multiple signaling pathways.
  Indeed, ZNF217 induces the activation of proliferation (Aurora-A, ERα signaling
  pathway, PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, LSD1), heterogeneity (TGF-β signaling pathway)
  and apoptosis inhibition (p53 signaling pathway) which promotes stress resistance
  associated with treatments, such as tamoxifen, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and trastuzumab.
  Other signaling pathways associated with drug resistance such as Wnt and Hedgehog
  pathways, would be activated by ZNF217, while whether ZNF217 induction of drug resistance
  through these two pathways need more studies. Attentionally, the PI3K/Akt pathway
  plays a significant role in ZNF217-induced drug resistance, while triciribine sufficiently
  reverses this event. Therefore, anti-ZNF217 treatment shows a great potency to reverse
  therapeutic resistance in cancer.
