caption: RNA-seq and proteomics analyses reveal RNA and protein signatures induced
  by PREPL KD. (A) Volcano plot showing the differential gene expression induced by
  PREPL KD in N2A cells using RNA-seq. Right panel shows top gene ontology pathways
  enriched in the differentially expressed genes caused by PREPL KD. (B) Volcano plot
  showing the differential protein expression induced by PREPL KD using proteomics.
  Right panel shows top gene ontology pathways enriched in the differentially expressed
  proteins caused by PREPL KD. (C) Overlap between RNA and protein signatures caused
  by PREPL KD. Although there are 425 DEGs by RNA-seq, only 93 (= 58 + 35) are present
  in the proteomics data. (D) Scatter plot showing the log2 fold change (FC) of the
  differentially expressed genes that present consistent direction of change in both
  RNA-seq and proteomics.
