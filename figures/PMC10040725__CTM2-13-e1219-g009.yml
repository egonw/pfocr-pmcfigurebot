caption: 'Potential targets for distinguishing cancer from precancer within the myeloid
  lineage: plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and macrophages: (A) the UMAP plot of the myeloid
  cells reclustered into 13 clusters; (B) the UMAP plot of the myeloid cells categorized
  into 5 subsets, including CDC1 cells, CDC2 cells, cycling cells, macrophages and
  pDCs (left); the UMAP plots of the myeloid cells presented in the 4 clinical groups,
  respectively, including human papillomavirus (HPV)‐infected cervical cancer, HPV‐infected
  high‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), HPV‐infected normal cervix and
  normal cervix without HPV infection (right); (C) the proportion of different myeloid
  cell subsets in the 4 clinical groups; (D) the UMAP feature plots of the marker
  genes of CDC1 cells (CLEC9A, XCR1), CDC2 cells (CD1C, FCER1A) and pDCs (LILRA4,
  CLEC4C); (E) the bar plot indicating the functional pathways of pDCs through Pathway
  analysis; (F) the violin plots manifesting the expression of IDO1 (upper) and CD274
  (lower) in pDCs of the 4 clinical groups; (G) the M1/M2 polarization score of the
  macrophages in clusters 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 (left); the UMAP plot of the macrophages
  exhibiting the M1/M2 polarization state in the 4 clinical groups, respectively;
  (H) the pseudotime plot elucidating the differentiation trajectories of different
  clusters of macrophages (left) and trajectory presented in M1/M2 polarization state
  (upper right) and according to the 4 clinical groups (lower right); (I) the bar
  plot indicating the functional pathways of macrophages in clusters 2, 4 and 7 through
  pathway analysis.'
