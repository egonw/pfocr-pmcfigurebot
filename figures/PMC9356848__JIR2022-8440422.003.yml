caption: ANTXR1 activates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by promoting β-catenin
  into the nucleus. (a) ANTXR1 interacted with LRP6 shown by the Co-IP assay that
  the lysates from the K562 cells transfected with the ANTXR1–GFP and LRP6-Flag plasmids
  by using GFP- and Flag-targeting antibodies. (b) β-Catenin expression in the cytoplasm
  and nucleus was detected by western blot analysis after K562 cells were transfected
  with the ANTXR1 vector, control vector, ANTXR1-shRNA vector, or NC-shRNA vector.
  (c, d) Quantification of western blots. The error bar represents the SD.∗P < 0.05
  and ∗∗P < 0.01. NC designates the negative control.
