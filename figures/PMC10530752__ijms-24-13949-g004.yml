caption: 'Effects of piperine on the induction of apoptosis and autophagy through
  the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in HSC-3 cells. (A,B) Expression levels of p-PI3K, p-Akt
  and p-mTOR proteins in HSC-3 cells after piperine (100 and 150 µM for 24 h) treatment.
  (C) Cell viability of HSC-3 cells pretreated with LY294002 (10 μM for 2 h) followed
  by treatment with piperine (100 μM for 24 h). (D,E) Expression levels of Bax, Bcl-2,
  p-mTOR, Beclin-1 and LC3 proteins in HSC-3 cells pretreated with LY294002 (10 µM
  for 2 h), followed by treatment with piperine (100 µM for 24 h). β-actin was used
  as loading control, and the quantification was performed using ImageJ. Data are
  presented as mean and SD for three samples. * p < 0.05, compared with the control
  group; #p < 0.05, compared with the piperine treatment group.'
