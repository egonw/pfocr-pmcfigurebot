caption: Protective role of OLNZ against the TI-mediated phosphorylation of ERK, JNK,
  p38 protein in the brain. The expression (% of sham) of (A) pERK, (B) pJNK proteins
  decreased significantly, and (C) pP38 proteins also decreased but not significantly
  after treatment with OLNZ in TI-induced gerbil hippocampus. Data were expressed
  as the mean ± SEM, n = 3/group. After performing a one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post
  hoc test, p < 0.05 for comparisons of treatment groups with the sham group (#) and
  p < 0.05 for comparisons with the stroke group (*) were considered significant.
