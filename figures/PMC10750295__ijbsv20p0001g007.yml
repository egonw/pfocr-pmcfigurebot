caption: Inhibition of PI3K-AKT pathway can potentiate the effects of BDP-9066 in
  PIK3CA mutant TNBC. (A) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis with the hallmark gene sets
  was performed using the gene expression profiles of the resistant and sensitive
  cell lines used in Fig . Total 11 gene sets are upregulated in the resistant cells.
  HALLMARK_PI3K_AKT_MTOR_SIGNALING is in the list of enriched in the resistant phenotype.
  Normalized Enrichment score is 1.081 and Nominal p-value is 0.093. (B and C) The
  relationship between the YAP1/WWTR1 expression and susceptibility to MRCKi in breast
  cancer cell lines are shown in scatterplots with regression lines. PIK3CA mutant
  cells are indicated by red dots and PIK3CA wild-type ones by blue dots, and the
  regression lines for each are also shown in the same color. YAP1/WWTR1 expression
  on the X-axis and IC50 against BDP-9066 (B) or BDP-8900 (C) on the Y-axis. (D) The
  effects of BDP-9066, alpelisib, and their combination on viability of SUM159 cells
  were determined by colony formation assay. (E) The combination index was determined
  by the Chou-Talalay method. (F) The effects of BDP-9066, alpelisib, and their combination
  on YAP/TAZ phosphorylation in SUM159 cells were examined by Western blotting. The
  relative ratios of p-YAP/YAP or p-TAZ/TAZ are shown in the right graph.
