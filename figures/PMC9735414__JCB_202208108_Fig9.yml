caption: The in vivo PARP1 activity regulates epileptic behavior (A-D) and graphical
  model summarizing the molecular mechanism of the KIF4 mutation-induced epilepsy
  (E). (A–D) The results of the PTZ kindling test. The chart representing the seizure
  stage classification (A) of the individual scores from mice with indicated genotypes
  and treatments, before and after the PTZ injection. Statistical analysis results
  of the cumulative number of maximum (B) and all (C) seizure stage, and the ratio
  of the occurrence of stage 4 (D). Data are presented as mean ± SEM (n = 10 mouse
  pairs). ****P < 0.0001 (two-way ANOVA). (E) Schematic model of the involvement of
  KIF4 in epileptogenesis. (a) The WT-KIF4 moderately binds to PARP1, and the cell
  exhibits a baseline level of PAR in the nucleus. (a′) Mut-KIF4 excessively binds
  to PARP1, and the cell exhibits a dramatically inhibited PARP1 activity. (b and
  b′) The suppressed PARP1 activity can alter the TrkB-KCC2 expression in the mutant
  group. Meanwhile, the aberrant protein expression triggers a higher intracellular
  chloride concentration. (c–d′) Subsequently, the hyper-branched dendrites and immature
  dendritic spines are dominantly observed in the mutant neuron.
