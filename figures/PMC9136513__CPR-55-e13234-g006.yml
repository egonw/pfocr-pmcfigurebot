caption: The OP rats were successfully constructed and the successful isolation and
  culture of BMSCs and OP‐BMSCs. (A, B) Micro‐CT analysis of the femur showed that
  OVX femoral trabecular number was reduced and a trabecular fracture was observed.
  (C) H&E staining and Masson staining showed that the OVX femoral trabecular number
  had decreased, bone thinning, areas of trabecular bone fracture, perforations, loss
  of the normal arch‐like structure, altered continuity and expanded bone marrow cavity.
  (D) Primary culture and subculture of OP‐BMSCs and BMSCs. The cell morphology was
  uniformly long spindle‐like. (E) The expression of the surface markers CD 29, CD
  90, CD 44, CD 31, CD 45 and CD 34 in OP‐BMSCs were shown by FACS. Data represent
  the mean ± SD (n ≥ 3). (*p < 0.05,**p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001)
