caption: Functional enrichment analysis of the DEGs. (A) The Venn diagram demonstrating
  intersecting DEGs in 3 GEO datasets. (B) GO Functional enrichment analysis of the
  183 intersecting DEGs. The x-axis represents the number of genes in each term, and
  the y-axis represents enriched GO terms. (C) KEGG Functional enrichment analysis
  of the 183 intersecting DEGs. The x-axis represents the P value for each pathway
  in the enrichment analysis, and the y-axis represents enriched KEGG pathways. DEGs
  = differentially expressed genes, GEO = gene expression omnibus, GO = gene ontology,
  KEGG = Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes.
