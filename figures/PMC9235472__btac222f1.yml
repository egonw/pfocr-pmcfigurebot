caption: Illustration of compounds and their metabolic pathways. Labels l0âˆ¼l10 represent
  different types of metabolic pathways. For example, beta-Alanine is metabolized
  by five pathways, labeled as l0, l3, l5, l7 and l9. Among them, pathway l7 is shared
  by Pentulose-5-phosphate and beta-Alanine while pathway l5 is shared by Phosphoenolpyruvate
  acid and beta-Alanine. Especially, pathway l0 is commonly shared by beta-Alanine,
  Pentulose-5-phosphate and Phosphoenolpyruvate acid. The list of metabolic pathway
  names can be found in

  interdependence for Metabolic Pathway prediction.'
