caption: ROS-dependent pathway involved in NETs release stimulated by S. mutans. (A)
  ROS production by neutrophils exposed to S. mutans. Production of ROS in response
  to S. mutans was measured by fluorescence after neutrophils were pre-stained with
  DCFH-DA and co-cultured with different physiological state of bacteria over 150min.
  ROS production after exposure to 24-h biofilm was compared to that of neutrophils
  control or planktonic cells or 4 h biofilm or 24 h dispersed biofilm or PMA positive
  control at each time point using a one-way ANOVA following Bonferroni multiple comparisons
  post-hoc test with p < 0.05 (n=6), SEM shown. (B) The protein level of Rac-1, Rac-2,
  and CARD-9 were analyzed using Western Blot. Neutrophils were co-cultured with planktonic
  and biofilm S. mutans for 4h. PMA and neutrophils were served as positive and negative
  control, respectively. The expression levels of Rac-1, Rac-2, and CARD-9 were determined
  by Western Blotting. Expression of Rac-1 and Card-9 were significantly upregulated
  in a time-dependent manner when exposed to planktonic S. mutans. However, the relative
  expression of Rac-1, Rac-2, and CARD-9 remained at a low level when challenged with
  biofilm S. mutans. Data were representative of three separate experiments.
