caption: Effect of dietary ASTA supplementation on the expression of testosterone
  synthesis pathway intermediaries at the mRNA and protein level in the testes of
  aging roosters. (A–C) The expression of testosterone synthesis pathway intermediaries
  at the mRNA level; the values are expressed as means ± standard deviation, n = 6
  in each group. (D) The expression of testosterone synthesis pathway intermediaries
  at the protein level; the results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (n
  = 3). a–c Means within a row with no common superscripts are significantly different
  (p < 0.05).
