caption: Upon recognition of a tumour-associated antigen (TAA) by a chimeric antigen
  receptor (CAR) T cell, an immune synapse is formed, followed by CAR T cell activation.
  Subsequently, cytotoxic granules containing perforin and granzymes are released,
  with the latter entering the target cell via perforin channels, triggering intrinsic
  apoptosis by damaging mitochondria and activating caspases,. Additionally, CAR T
  cells upregulate FAS ligand, which engages the FAS receptor on target cells, triggering
  the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis and caspase-mediated targeted cell death. Further,
  CAR T cells release IFNÎ³ and TNF that activate immune cells such as macrophages.
  CAR T cells might recognize TAAs on non-malignant cells, leading to undesired lysis
  of healthy tissues. Next-generation CAR T cells can also be equipped with additional
  effector functions (such as IL-12 secretion) that extend the immune response to
  include endogenous T cells,. OTOT, on-target, off-tumour toxicity.
