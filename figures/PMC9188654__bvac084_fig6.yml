caption: 'GPRC6A knockout does not restore ucOCN-mediated IL-1β downregulation. (A)
  Schematic illustration of the CRISPR/CAS9 system design. The highlighted bar shows
  the nucleotide sequences of the gRNA/cas9 (476-495). (B) The efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9-driven
  GPRC6A knockout was confirmed using Western blot. β-actin was used as a loading
  control. (C) After treatment with 10 ng/mL of TNF-α with or without ucOCN pretreatment,
  the effect of GPRC6A knockout on mRNA and protein levels corresponding to IL-1β
  was analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively. The
  data represent the mean ± SD of triplicates. * P < 0.05 compared lentiCON-transfected
  cells without TNF-α treatment; #P < 0.05 compared to lentiCON-transfected cells
  with TNF-α treatment; Brackets show a significant difference (P < 0.05) between
  indicated groups.'
