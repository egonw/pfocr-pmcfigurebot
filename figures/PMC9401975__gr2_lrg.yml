caption: Differentially expressed genes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from
  patients with IAPA, influenza only, CAPA, or COVID-19 onlyVolcano plots showing
  differentially expressed genes for the comparisons of IAPA versus influenza only
  (A), CAPA versus COVID-19 only (B), IAPA versus CAPA (C), and influenza only versus
  COVID-19 only (D). A dotted blue line marks a log2(fold change) value of zero. A
  dotted red line crossing the y-axis marks a Benjamini–Hochberg q value of 0·05.
  The two dotted red lines crossing the x-axis marks a log2(fold change) of 0·4 and
  –0·4, respectively. We selected genes to present if they were linked to interesting
  pathways related to antiviral and antifungal immunity. (E) Venn diagram showing
  the downregulated differentially expressed genes shared in the comparisons of IAPA
  versus influenza only and CAPA versus COVID-19 only. (F) Dot plot showing ClueGO
  hypergeometric enrichment pathway analysis based on the downregulated differentially
  expressed genes of the four disease comparisons, with Gene Ontology biological process
  as the pathway database. *For the comparison of IAPA versus CAPA, differentially
  expressed genes with q values (Benjamini–Hochberg) of less than 0·20 were included
  to generate the analyses. Differentially expressed genes with q values (Benjamini–Hochberg)
  of less than 0·05 were used for all other comparisons. CAPA=COVID-19-associated
  pulmonary aspergillosis. IAPA=influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis. NIK=NF-κB-inducing
  kinase.
