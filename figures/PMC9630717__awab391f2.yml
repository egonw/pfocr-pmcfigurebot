caption: Functional analysis of seven GABRD variants in α1β3δ receptors. (A) The concatenated
  pentameric α1-β3-α1-δ-β3 cDNA construct is illustrated with four linkers (purple)
  and resulting expressed fusion protein viewed from the extracellular side. (B) X.
  laevis oocytes were injected with cRNA for concatenated receptors and subjected
  to two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology. Representative traces show GABAmax
  (316 µM)-evoked currents at receptors containing the indicated δ subunit variants.
  Bars above the traces designate the 50-s application time. The top row depicts all
  traces on the same current amplitude scale (200 nA). The bottom row depicts the
  same traces scaled to identical size. (C) GABAmax-evoked peak-current amplitudes
  for the indicated receptors are depicted as box with whiskers, where the box marks
  the first, second and third quartiles and whiskers extend to minimum and maximum
  values observed for n = 27–30 experiments. The mean value is indicated for each
  dataset (). Datasets were significantly different (P < 0.0001, ANOVA Kruskal–Wallis
  test) with the indicated significance levels between variant and the wild-type (WT)
  receptor (post hoc Dunn’s test). (D) Normalized GABA-evoked peak current amplitudes
  are depicted as mean ± SD as a function of the GABA concentration for n = 6–9 experiments
  for the indicated receptors. A Hill equation was fitted to the data using non-linear
  regression and fitted EC50 values are indicated in the panel. Full regression results
  are presented in  and . (E) Estimated open probabilities were calculated by comparing
  the response of GABAmax (316 µM) to the response of a mixture of GABAmax, allopregnanolone
  (3.16 µM), etomidate (31.6 µM) and DS2 (10 µM) for the indicated receptors (see
  also ). Data are depicted as box with whiskers for n = 15–19 experiments with indication
  of mean values () and were significantly different (P < 0.0001, ANOVA Kruskal–Wallis
  test, post hoc Dunn’s test). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001.
