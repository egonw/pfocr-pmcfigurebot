caption: FAM83D is highly expressed in tumor tissues and is associated with patient
  prognosis. (A) The expression of FAM83D was higher in TCGA-LIHC tumor tissues than
  non-tumor tissues. (B) Data in GEO GSE25097 and GSE76427 show that the level of
  FAM83D is higher in HCC tissues than non-tumor tissues. (C) The expression of FAM83D
  in TCGA-LIHC tissues based on tumor grade. (D) The expression of FAM83D in TCGA-LIHC
  tissues based on individual cancer stages. (E) Patients with high levels of FAM83D
  had significantly lower overall survival than patients with low levels of FAM83D.
  (F) FAM83D protein expression in 5 HCC cell lines. (G) The effect of siRNA knockdown
  on FAM83D in SNU449 cells was verified by Western blotting. (H) The effect of siRNA
  knockdown on FAM83D in HUH7 cells was verified by Western blotting. (I) The effect
  of pcDNA overexpress on FAM83D in BEL7402 cells was verified by Western blotting.
