caption: 'Molecular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effect of EETs. EETs
  suppress the MMP-2 and MMP-9 to prevent mitochondrial dysfunction. EETs induce the
  expression of BDNF, then stimulate BDNF-TrkB signaling. Subsequently, BDNF-TrkB
  signaling stimulates the MEK–ERK–CREB signaling pathway, promoting neurite outgrowth,
  neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, EETs reduce oxidative stress
  and suppress ER stress through suppression of NF-kB and activation of Bcl-2, respectively.
  Moreover, EETs protect against apoptosis through suppressing the BAX and Caspase-3;
  MMP-2: matrix metalloproteinase-2; MMP-9: matrix metalloproteinase-9; BDNF: brain
  derived neurotrophic factor; TrkB: tropomyosin receptor kinase B; MEK: mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinase; CREB: cAMP response
  element binding protein; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; NF-κB: nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells; Bcl-2: B-cell lymphoma 2; BAX: Bcl-2-associated X protein.
