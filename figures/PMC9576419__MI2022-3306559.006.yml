caption: Effects of JSH-23 on cardiac inflammation and myocardial cell apoptosis.
  (a) Phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 pathway components was detected. (b) Inflammatory
  mediators in the heart and serum were examined. (c). The numbers of TUNEL-positive
  myocardial cells were quantified. N = 5 − 10 in each group. ∗p < 0.05 vs. the LPS + DMSO + VFT
  group.
