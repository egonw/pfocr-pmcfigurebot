caption: Arecoline regulated global mRNA changes in OSCC cells. A, Volcano plot depicts
  upregulated and downregulated genes in CAL33‐Arecoline (CAL33_A) vs CAL33‐Control
  (CAL33_C) (log2 fold change > 1.0, P value adjusted (padj) < .05). B, Bubble plots
  of GO analysis showed that upregulated genes were predominantly enriched in the
  inflammatory response signaling pathway. C, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of
  transcriptome sequencing revealed that signaling pathway changes were mainly enriched
  in the cytokine‐cytokine receptor pathway, and PI3K‐Akt signaling pathway. GSEA
  of differentially expressed genes might be enriched in chemokine signaling pathway
  (D) and cell adhesion molecules (E)
