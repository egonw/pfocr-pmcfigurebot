caption: Glucose metabolism. In response to insulin, Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt
  pathway is stimulated; this leads to glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocating
  to the membrane. GLUT4 allows the influx of glucose. Glucose is first phosphorylated
  at carbon 6 to give glucose 6-phosphate, which is going to act as a precursor to
  glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Glycolysis gives 2 pyruvate molecules
  that are going to be decarboxylated to result in 2 acetyl-CoA molecules. Acetyl-CoA
  is the main driver for tricarboxylic cycle (TCA) that produces NADH and FADH2. NADH
  and FADH2 join oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to produce paramount energy. Glycolysis
  produces less energy production and lactic acid. PPP is the pathway that produces
  ribose 5-phospahate, which is key in nucleotide biosynthesis. Nucleotides are the
  building blocks for nucleic acids, which are the vital element in cell proliferation
  and gene expression. PPP also produces NADPH, which is important in glutathione
  antioxidant system. Glutathione system upregulation is one of the resistant mechanisms
  adopted by cancer cells to resist radio- and chemotherapy. The diagram is adapted
  from [] and created with BioRender.com.
