caption: 'IRF1 gain-and loss-of function models in human cells. A and B: Western blot
  image of IRF1, phospho-Akt, total Akt, and β-Actin in IRF1-FLAG overexpressed HEK293T
  (A) or Calu3 (B) cells treated with insulin (100 nM) at the indicated time points.
  C: Western blot image of IRF1 and β-Actin in HEK293T treated with TNF-α with the
  indicated concentrations for 24 h. D: Western blot image of IRF1, phospho-Akt, total
  Akt, and β-Actin in HEK293T transfected with negative control non-targeting gRNA
  (Con. gRNA) and IRF1 gene targeting gRNA (IRF1 gRNA) cloned CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid
  (px459v2) and treated with TNF-α for 24 h followed by insulin (100 nM) treatment
  at the indicated time points.'
