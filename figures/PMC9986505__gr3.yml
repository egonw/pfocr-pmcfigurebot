caption: 'PHENSIM proteomic pathway analysis in SARS-CoV-2-infected human host cells.
  PHENSIM pathway analysis of the Caco-2 cell experiment was simulated in silico to
  reproduce in vitro results presented by Bojkova et al. at the 24 h time-point post
  SARS-CoV-2 infection A) Schematic representation depicting the experimental design
  as described by Bojkova et al. in vitro: the human colon epithelial carcinoma cell
  line, Caco-2 cells, were infected and monitored for 24hrs post SARS-CoV-2 infection.
  Naturally occurring heavy isotype SILAC labelling was used to quantify translational
  changes, as this method does not affect cellular behavior allowing for unbiased
  pathway analysis. Quantitative translation and whole cell proteomics by LC-MS/MS
  was performed []. B&C) Heatmaps depicting a representative subset of the 30 top
  differentially expressed proteins (FDR<0.05) involved in viral infection after 24hr
  SARS-CoV-2 infection B) as predicted by PHENSIM in silico (right column, solid squares),
  compared to expression results as determined by Bojkova et al. (left column, checkered
  squares) and C) as described by Bojkova et al. (left column, checkered) with side-by-side
  PHENSIM expression prediction for that protein (right column, solid). D) The heatmap
  shows the perturbation, as computed by PHENSIM, for a selection signaling pathways
  described as significant by Bojkova et al. in their analysis. E) The heatmap depicts
  the Top 50 pathways (25 Up- and 25 Down-regulated) significantly affected at 24h
  post infection, hence with p-value ≤ 0.05, according to PHENSIM prediction. In this
  case the Activity Score was taken into account. Color gradient reflects PHENSIM
  activity; the value of the activity score attributed to each pathway from blue (downregulation)
  to red (maximum upregulation). Caco-2; the human colon epithelial carcinoma cell
