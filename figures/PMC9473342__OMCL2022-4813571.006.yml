caption: 'DSC2 suppressed the nuclear translocation of β-catenin via inhibiting γ-catenin
  competitive binding to E-cadherin with β-catenin. (a) After knocking down and stably
  overexpressing DSC2 gene of MGC-803 cells, the expression of β-catenin in nucleus
  was determined by Western blot assay. Data are presented as mean ± SD from three
  separate experiments. ∗∗p < 0.01 vs. BC. ##p < 0.01 vs. NC (or Lenti-NC) group.
  (b) After stably expressing DSC2 gene of MGC-803 cells, Co-IP assay was performed
  to analyze the interaction of DSC2/γ-catenin and DSC2/β-catenin by DSC2. (c and
  d) After stably expressing or knocking down DSC2 gene of MGC-803 cells, Co-IP assay
  was performed to analyze the interaction of E-cadherin/γ-catenin and E-cadherin/β-catenin
  by E-cadherin. The data were presented as mean ± SD, n = 3. ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001
  vs. NC (or Lenti-NC) group.'
