caption: The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway regulates NDV proliferation. (A) NDV
  infection inhibits the activity of TOPFlash. DF-1 cells were transfected with TOPFlash
  or FOPFlash together with pRL-TK. At 24 h posttransfection, the cells were infected
  with F48E9 (0.01 or 0.1 MOI). At 24 h postinfection, the cells were harvested for
  the quantification of the luciferase activity. Mean values ± SDs are shown (n = 5).
  Significance was assessed via two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t tests. *, P < 0.05.
  (B) NDV infection inhibits the downstream genes of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
  DF-1 cells were infected with F48E9 (0.01 or 0.1 MOI). At 24 h postincubation, the
  cells were harvested to assess the expression of genes related to the β-catenin
  pathway. β-catenin, AXIN2, CCND1, LEF1, and MMP7. Mean values ± SDs are shown (n = 4).
  Significance was assessed via two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t tests. *, P < 0.05;
  **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001. (C) NDV infection degrades the β-catenin through the
  ubiquitin-proteasome system. DF-1 cells were infected with F48E9 (0.01 MOI) and
  incubated with MG-132 (200 nM) or wortmannin (500 nM). At 24 h postincubation, the
  cells were harvested to assess the expression of protein via Western blotting (upper
  panel). The relative quantification of the target protein level was analyzed via
  ImageJ (lower panel). Mean values ± SDs are shown (n = 3). Significance was assessed
  via two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t tests. ns, not significant; **, P < 0.01. (D
  and E) Exogenous expression of β-catenin inhibits NDV proliferation. DF-1 cells
  were transfected with pCAGGS-HA-β-catenin. At 24 h posttransfection, the cells were
  infected with F48E9 (0.01 MOI). At 24 h postinfection, the cells were harvested
  to assess the expression of viral protein via Western blotting (D). The supernatant
  was harvested to assess the viral titer via plaque assay (E). Mean values ± SDs
  are shown (n = 3). Significance was assessed via two-tailed, unpaired Student’s
  t tests. **, P < 0.01. (F and G) LiCl inhibits NDV proliferation in DF-1 cells.
  DF-1 cells were infected with F48E9 (0.01 MOI) and incubated with LiCl. At 24 h
  postinfection, the cells were harvested to assess the expression of viral protein
  via Western blotting (F). The supernatant was harvested to assess the viral titer
  via plaque assay (G). Mean values ± SDs are shown (n = 3). Significance was assessed
  via two-tailed, unpaired Student’ s t tests. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01. (H) LiCl
  promotes the expression of IFN-β in DF-1 cells. DF-1 cells were incubated with LiCl
  (20 mM). At 24 h postincubation, the cells were harvested to assess the expression
  of IFN-β via qRT-PCR. Mean values ± SDs are shown (n = 4). Significance was assessed
  via two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t tests. **, P < 0.01. (I and J) iCRT14 do not
  affect NDV proliferation in DF-1 cells. DF-1 cells were infected with F48E9 (0.01
  MOI) and then incubated with iCRT14. At 24 h postinfection, the cells were harvested
  to assess the expression of viral protein via Western blotting (I). The supernatant
  was harvested to assess the viral titer via plaque assay (J). Mean values ± SDs
  are shown (n = 3). Significance was assessed via two-tailed, unpaired Student’s
  t tests. ns, not significant.
