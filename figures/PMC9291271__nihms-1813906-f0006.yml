caption: 'SOD1 activity is increased in AD.(A) SOD1 activity was followed in WT mouse
  neurons cultures treated with different concentrations of AβO during 1 h. In-gel
  activity assays showed that AβO increased SOD1 activity in a dose-dependent manner.
  Data are representative of three independent assays. (B) SOD1 activity is higher
  in AD human brains. SOD1 activity assays were analyzed in human brain cell extracts
  taken from deceased patients affected by AD and compared to normal controls. Samples
  were analyzed by In-gel activity assays and the average SOD1 zymogen: SOD1 protein
  ratio in Normal and AD groups were analyzed by using student t-test. No significant
  outliers were detected on each group of patient-derived brain samples (Grubss’test;
  GraphPad software).(C) Model. Under physiological conditions, nutrient stimulated
  and tau-dependent activation of lysosomal mTORC1 leads to phosphorylation of SOD1
  at T40, directly regulating mitochondrial oxidative pathways and mtDNA synthesis
  by a mechanism independent of Ck1γ2, but likely involving substrates sensitive to
  oxidation by hydrogen peroxide. Insulin and amino acid-regulated mitochondrial functions
  are blocked by AβOs, which increased the lysosomal positioning of TSC, likely decreasing
  mTORC1 activity and stimulating it instead at the PM, where mTORC1 kinase activity
  triggers cell cycle re-entry (CCR), a frequent prelude to cortical neuron death
  in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Thus, SOD1 is at the crossroads of regulating mitochondrial
  activity through the NiMA pathway and mediating its disruption in AD.'
