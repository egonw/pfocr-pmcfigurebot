caption: 'ATX/LPA signaling insight in osteoblastic lineage. From left to right, osteoblastic
  differentiation sequence from MSCs to osteocyte: in the upper part of the figure
  the canonical transduction pathway downstream of LPA1 and LPA4 activated receptors
  are shown. At the bottom part their consequent transcription activation: LPA signals
  directly through LPA1 and LPA4 receptors interplay and via further cross-talk with
  active Î²catenin (grey stone) and FGFs signaling pathway (green lines). At early
  osteoblast stages, LPA1 receptor is predominant and induces osteoblast commitment
  and differentiation via Gi signaling activating early gene expression ALP, Col1,
  BSP (bottom part of the figure- represented by black arrows). Potential synergy
  with ROCK1/Beta catenin pathway leading to possible transcriptional co-operation
  to enhance transcription is shown by discontinuous green arrow. In full mature osteoblasts,
  LPA4 expression increases and its downstream signaling prevails to block/control
  osteoblastic differentiation by ROCK1/Beta catenin inhibition (continuous red line).
  In osteocytes, LPA1 signaling is again predominant. LPA1 co-operate with FGF2 (continuous
  green arrow) and probably with FGF7 to promote E11, Dmp1, Dkk1 expression and osteocyte
  specification (black arrows).'
