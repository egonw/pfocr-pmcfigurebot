caption: The inhibitory effects of VEGFR2 signaling by VEGFR2 docking with IPA in
  microgravity-stimulated ARPE19 cells. (A) VEGF expression levels in cell lysate
  and (B) secretion levels in conditioned medium were detected by ELISA on day 7 after
  microgravity stimulation with or without IPA. (C) Expression levels of VEGFR2 and
  its related proteins, including AKT and ERK, in microgravity-stimulated ARPE19 cells
  with PBS (SMG; black) or 2.5 nM IPA (SMG/IPA; gray) were validated by Western blotting.
  (D) VEGFR2, (E) phosphorylated AKT, and (F) ERK were quantified by Image J software.
  Means denoted by different letters indicate significant differences between the
  groups (p < 0.05). SMG, simulated microgravity; IPA, ishophloroglucin A; VEGF, vascular
  endothelial growth factor; VEGFR2, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2.
