figure_title: Apatinib induced autophagy in NSCLC cells
caption: 'A, B Representative TEM images and analysis of the number of autophagosomes/autolysosomes
  of A549 and H460 cells with apatinib (20 μM, 48 h) or negative control incubation.
  Short red arrows: autophaosomes or autolysosomes. C LC3 I/II expression was detected
  by WB in A549 and H460 cells after treatment with incremental concentrations of
  apatinib for 48 h. D, E Cyto-ID detection assay measured the autophagy levels of
  A549 and H460 cells after treatment with incremental concentrations of apatinib
  for 48 h. F Representative images obtained by confocal microscopy of GFP-LC3 expression
  in A549 and H460 cells with apatinib (20 μM, 48 h) or negative control treatment.
  Data are presented as mean ± SEM from three independent experiments.'
