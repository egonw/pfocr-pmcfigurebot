caption: Hinokitiol suppressed sphere formation. (A) MCF-7, (B) T47D, and (C) MDA-MB-231
  cells were cultured in a 6 cm dish and treated with hinokitiol for 48 h. After treatment,
  cells were detached and seeded at a density of 2000 cells per well in ultra-low
  attachment plates. A sphere formation assay was employed to evaluate both diameters
  and numbers of spheres formed. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 5–6). * p <
  0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001 as compared with control group.
