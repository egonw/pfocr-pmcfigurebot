caption: 'KEGG network diagram of the HIF-1 signaling pathwayWhite boxes: biological
  pathway maps. Green boxes: genes or genetic products. Circles: molecules. Solid
  line arrows: direct relationship or molecular interaction. Dashed line arrows: indirect
  relationship or unknown reaction. Perpendicular lines: repression. +p: phosphorylation.
  +u: ubiquitination. Green boxes + arrows + circles + arrows = gene expression relationship.
  In red are the proteins encoded by the FAT-PM2.5-DN signature in this pathway. (For
  interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is
  referred to the Web version of this article.)'
