caption: In vitro study showed Amentoflavone inhibits CRC cell migration, invasion,
  and EMT. (A,B) Transwell assays were performed to examine the potential migration
  (A) and invasion (B) of HCT116 and SW480 cells treated with amentoflavone (5 µm)
  or vehicle (crystal violet staining, control group), where the scale bar =50 µm.
  (C) qPCR validation of EMT marker mRNA expression in HCT116 and SW480 cells treated
  with amentoflavone (5 µm) or vehicle. (D) WB validation of EMT marker protein expression
  in HCT116 and SW480 cells treated with amentoflavone (5 µm) or vehicle. (A-C) N=3,
  mean ± SEM, *P<0.05, by Student’s t-test. Data represents similar results from 3
  independent experiments. CRC, colorectal cancer; EMT, epithelial to mesenchymal
  transition; qPCR, quantitative polymerase chain reaction; SEM, structural equation
  modeling; WB, western blotting.
