caption: 'Ire1 proteolytic cleavage in the PV-infected HeLa cells is not affected
  by the pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-Oph. HeLa cells were infected with PV in the absence
  or presence of 20 Î¼M Q-VD-Oph. After the time indicated, cells were lysed and analyzed
  by Western blotting with polyclonal anti-Ire1 antibodies (Abcam #ab37073). Asterisks
  denote the same as in .'
