caption: Effects of CUG and NCUG growth patterns on hepatic inflammatory factor expression
  and NF-κB/MAPK pathways. (A) Phosphorylation level of the NF-κB/MAPK pathway in
  liver tissue. (B) mRNA expression of liver NF-κB/MAPK pathway-related genes. (C)
  mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory factors in liver tissue. All data with
  error bars are mean ± SEM. In histograms, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
  CUG = catch-up growth; NCUG = non-catch-up growth; WW = weaning weight.

  and Inflammatory Response in Intrauterine Growth Restriction Piglets with Different
  Growth Patterns before Weaning.
