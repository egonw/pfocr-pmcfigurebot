caption: Decreased proliferation of SCs caused by Ltf deficiency is regulated by the
  ERK1/2 signaling pathway. (A) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was performed on
  SCs from WT and Ltf-KO mice grown for 4 days in vitro. (B) GO enrichment analysis
  was performed on SCs from WT and Ltf-KO mice grown for 4 days in vitro. (C) Fluorescence
  quantitative analysis of the expression of cell cycle-related genes in SCs from
  WT and Ltf-KO mice grown for 4 days in vitro, using actin as an internal reference.
  (D) Left, the immunoblots presented here illustrate the protein levels of p-ERK,
  ERK, cyclin D, CDK4 and β-tubulin in SCs from WT and Ltf-KO mice grown for 4 days
  in vitro; right, quantification analysis of p-ERK, cyclin D1 and CDK4 proteins levels
  from Western blot bands. β-tubulin was used as an internal reference. n = 3 in each
  group. ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001.
