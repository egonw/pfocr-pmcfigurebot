caption: MCU promotes osteoclast differentiation and absorption function. (a) The
  BMMs were planted in 96-well plates with a cell count of about 8 × 103/well, si-MCU,
  or empty vector and were transfected into BMMs, adding M-CSF in the presence or
  absence of RANKL to induce osteoclast differentiation for 5 days. TRAP staining
  was utilized to show differentiation results. (b) Quantification of the TRAP-positive
  multinuclear cell numbers and the area occupied by image J software. (c) si-MCU
  or empty vector is transfected into Raw264.7 cells, and osteoclast-specific proteins
  and transfection efficiency of MCU silencing were showed by western blot after RANKL
  stimulation for 48 h. (d) Image J was used to quantitatively detect the gray value
  of the protein bands, normalized to β-actin (e) TRAP staining results after transfecting
  MCU plasmid or empty vector into the BMMs and adding RANKL and M-CSF to induce differentiation
  for 5 days. (f) Quantitative results of the TRAP-positive multinuclear cell numbers
  and the area occupied. (g) The Raw264.7 cells were transfected MCU plasmid or empty
  vector and stimulated with RANKL for 48 hours, and western blot was used to display
  osteoclast-specific proteins and transfection efficiency of MCU overexpression.
  (h) Image J was used to quantitatively detect the gray value of the protein band,
  normalized to GAPDH. (i) The bone slices were placed in a 96-well plate before planting
  BMMs. The cells were transfected with MCU plasmid and si-MCU and treated with RANKL
  to induce osteoclast. Bone resorption pits on bone slices under electron microscopy
  scanning. (j) Quantitative results of bone resorption pits, scale bar = 500 μm.
  Data was presented as means ± SEM; n = 3; ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.
