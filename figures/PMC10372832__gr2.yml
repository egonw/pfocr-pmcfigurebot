caption: 'Compound A1 was photouncaged by the UV light. (A) Chemical synthesis of
  compound A1. Reagents and conditions: (a) N2H4/H2O, KOH, EtOH, glycol, reflux, yield
  83.6%; (b) HNO3, DCM, 0 °C, yield 66.7%; (c) benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide (Triton
  B), CH2O; MeOH, reflux, yield 33.0%; (d) i) triphosgene, Na2CO3, THF; ii) FLC, NaH,
  DMF, −20 °C, yield 10.0% two steps. (B) HPLC analysis of compound A1 irradiated
  with 365 nm light at 25 mW/cm2. (C) Photolysis kinetics of compound A1 upon 25 mW/cm2,
  365 nm light irradiation. The concentration of compound A1 was monitored by HPLC
  at different time point after irradiation at 365 nm light. (D) Recording of 1H NMR
  changes in the photouncaging process of compound A1. (E) Linear fit of photolysis
  rate of compound A1. The data were derived from natural logarithm of the concentration
  of compound A1 in C.'
