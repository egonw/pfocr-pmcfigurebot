caption: 'Anti-inflammatory effects of Loratadine on the constituent kinases of the
  AP-1 signaling pathway. (a) RAW264.7 cells were pre-treated with Loratadine (40
  μM) for 30 min following LPS treatment (1 μg/mL) for the indicated time points (15–45
  min). The expression levels of c-Jun, c-Fos, and Lamin A/C (control) within the
  nuclear fraction were assessed by Western blotting analysis. (b–e) RAW264.7 cells
  were pre-treated with Loratadine (40 μM) for 30 min following LPS treatment (1 μg/mL)
  for the indicated time points (5–60 min). The levels of total or phosphorylated
  c-Jun, c-Fos, ERK, JNK, p-38, MEK1/2, MKK4, MKK7, TAK-1, and β-actin (control) within
  the whole lysate were measured by Western blotting analysis. NF: nuclear fraction;
  WCL: whole cell lysate. (f) Acute gastritis was induced using HCl/EtOH after vehicle,
  Loratadine, or ranitidine injection. Stomach samples were obtained and cut open
  after sacrifice to assess stomach bleeding levels. (g) Stomach samples were ground
  in liquid nitrogen and lysed using cell lysis buffer. Western blotting was performed
  to assess the expression levels of total and phosphorylated c-Fos and β-Actin (control).
  NF: nuclear fraction; WCL: whole cell lysate; Ran: Ranitidine. (Bottom panels of
  a–e,g). Relative intensity of these proteins was calculated by ImageJ.'
