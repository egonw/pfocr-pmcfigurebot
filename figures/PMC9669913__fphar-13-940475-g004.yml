caption: 'Eupatilin attenuates TNF-α-induced ECM degradation and improves the senescence
  of NP cells via inhibition of the MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway. (A) Western blot
  was used to detect the expression of MMP9, MMP13, SOX9, and COL2A1 proteins in the
  cytoplasm after treatment with TNF-α (20 ng/ml) with or without eupatilin (6.25 μM,
  12.5 μM) for 24 h. (B) According to the results, proteins in (A) were statistically
  analyzed (n = 3). (C) Western blot was performed on the effects of eupatilin on
  the phosphorylation of IκBα and p65, and total IκBα induced by TNF-α. NP cells were
  pretreated with eupatilin (6.25 μM, 12.5 μM) for 2 h before the stimulation with
  TNF-α (20 ng/ml) for 20 min. (D) Statistical analysis (n = 3) according to the results
  in (C). (E) Western blot was performed on the effects of eupatilin on the phosphorylation
  of p38, RRK, and JNK induced by TNF-α. NP cells were pretreated with eupatilin (6.25 μM,
  12.5 μM) for 2 h before the stimulation with TNF-α (20 ng/ml) for 20 min. (F) Statistical
  analysis (n = 3) according to the results in (E). Data are presented as the mean
  ± SD. n = 3, compared with the TNF-α-alone group. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p <
  0.001, and ****p < 0.0001; ns: the difference was not statistically significant.'
