caption: 'Clock neurons show an enriched expression of GPCRs. (A) Plots show normalized
  expression levels of indicated genes from sorted clock neurons (clk856 > EGFP) at
  ZT2 and ZT14. As expected, Clk expression is significantly higher at ZT2 than at
  ZT14, whereas tim expression is significantly higher at ZT14 compared to ZT2. Housekeeping
  genes such as Rpl32 and Act5C were not significantly different between those timepoints.
  (B) Heatmap of differentially expressed genes between clock neurons (clk856 > EGFP)
  and randomly chosen neurons (nSyb > EGFP) at ZT2 (2 repeats, R1 and R2) and ZT14
  (2 repeats, R1 and R2) with an at least twofold difference in expression at a false
  discovery rate of <0.05. Relatively high expression is displayed in red and relatively
  low expression is displayed in blue (Z-scores indicated on top of the graph). (C)
  Examples of up- or down-regulated genes representing enriched GO terms. Pdf is significantly
  up-regulated in the clock network (GO: Circadian control of sleep wake cycle) as
  are tbh (GO: Octopamine and tyramine signaling pathway) and 5-HT1A (GO: G protein
  coupled receptors). br on the other hand is significantly down-regulated in the
  clock network (GO: Antennal development). Both timepoints were combined for this
  analysis. (D) Normalized expression (RPM) of GPCR genes in the clock network. GPCR
  gene expression varies dramatically between receptors from being not expressed (<3
  RPM, red line) to being highly expressed. Both timepoints were combined for this
  analysis. (E) Relative expression of GPCRs in clock neurons (clk856 > EGFP) relative
  to randomly chosen neurons (nSyb > EGFP). Reads for individual GPCRs were pooled
  across timepoints and replicates and a ratio was calculated. A total of 22 GPRs
  are at least twofold higher expressed in the clock cells (red bars) compared to
  only 2 GPCRs being at least twofold down-regulated in the clock cells (blue bars).
  The x-axis is log2 scaled. Both timepoints were combined for this analysis.'
