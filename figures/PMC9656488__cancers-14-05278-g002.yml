caption: DNA Repair Pathways; Protein Recruitment and Cell Cycle Activation. After
  a DSB, The MRN complex locates to the site of damage and recruits and helps activate
  ATM stimulating its phosphorylation at Ser1981. Activated ATM phosphorylates all
  three MRN proteins; NBS1 on sites Ser278 and Ser343, RAD50 on site Ser635, and Mre11
  on sites Ser676, Ser678 and Ser681. The activation of ATM results in multiple downstream
  events including activation of p53 by phosphorylation at Ser15 and Ser20, and CHEK2
  at Th68. Active p53 and CHEK2 in-turn activate different cell cycle checkpoints.
  Activation of ATR results in the phosphorylation of CHEK1 on Ser317 and Ser345.
  ATR can also catalyze phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 and Ser20 as the catalytic
  subunit of DNA-PKcs. The activation of cell cycle checkpoints at different stages
  often determines the method of repair and which additional proteins need to be recruited.
  In addition to the MRN complex, each method of repair replies upon other proteins
  involved in the pathway to facilitated DNA double-stranded repair.
