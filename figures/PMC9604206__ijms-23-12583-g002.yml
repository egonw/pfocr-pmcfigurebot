caption: Regulation of Notch signaling. Notch inactive signal peptide precursor is
  synthesized in endoplasmic reticulum and moves to Golgi. After S1 cleavage process
  by furin-like convertases, it is translocated into the cell membrane. Following
  signal transduction from adjacent cell, S2 cleavage occurs via the disintegrins
  and metalloproteinases (ADAM). Truncated notch fragment is further processed by
  S3 and S4 cleavage, and thus, Notch intracellular domain (NICD) forms. NICD is the
  active form of the Notch receptor, which can direct transcriptional activity by
  entering the nucleus []. Notch signaling activation stimulates osteogenic differentiation
  and bone mineralization while inhibiting osteogenesis by suppressing Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling. Notch inhibition by a signaling inhibitor can enhance osteogenesis (1,
  2 and a). Activated Notch signaling in osteocytes can suppress bone resorption and
  increase bone density by reducing sclerostin and dickkopf Wnt signaling pathway
  inhibitor 1 while upregulating Wnt signaling (b). Notch 1-3 deficiency directly
  promotes osteoclastic differentiation, and Notch1 deficiency can promote this process
  indirectly by decreasing OPG and RANKL ratio. The Notch1/Jagged1 suppresses osteoclastogenesis,
  whereas the Notch2/Delta-like (DLL) 1 activates. Notch activation affects osteoclast
  formation since it strongly inhibits M-CSF (3 and c) []. Adapted from “Notch Signaling
  Pathway”, by BioRender.com (2022). Retrieved from https://app.biorender.com/biorender-templates.
