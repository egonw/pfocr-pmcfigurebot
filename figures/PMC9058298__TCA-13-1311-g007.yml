caption: Expression patterns of hnRNPK in lung cancer tissues. (a) Immunohistochemical
  analysis of hnRNPK expression in 94 lung cancer samples and (b) the score of hnRNPK
  expression. (c) Survival curves were compared using the Kaplan–Maier method according
  to hnRNPK expression levels. The log‐rank test was performed to evaluate statistical
  significance.**p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
