caption: Reversible suppression of VEPs by LGN ultrasound sonication. (A) Grand-average
  VEP responses to 20-ms binocular light-flash visual stimuli before (blue line, Baseline),
  during (red line, LGN), and after (gray line, Control spot stimulation) sonication
  of the LGN. Traces were normalized to the maximal response at baseline per animal,
  then averaged across experiments (N = 6 experiments from 5 animals). For LGN and
  control VEPs, data were combined across blocks (2 for LGN and 3 for control). Only
  responses from the light-only condition (i.e. trials without TUS) were included
  in the analysis. Traces were smoothed with a 15-point (15 ms) moving averages filter
  for illustration purposes only. For a subset of animals, the EEG trace from -10
  to + 40 ms was removed and interpolated to eliminate a light-flash-related artifact,
  for illustration purposes only. (B) Data presented as in Panel A, for the Active
  Sham condition (in which ultrasound sonication was determined to be off-target post-experiment,
  N = 4) and a no-FUS control animal (N = 1,total N = 5). (C) Peak-to-peak VEP amplitude
  measurements for individual experiments (colored lines) and Mean + /− SEM across
  experiments (black line), for the six experimental blocks (Baseline, two LGN sonications
  and three non-LGN sonications), for LGN-sonication animals. (D) Same as C, for Sham
  condition animals, across the six experimental blocks (Baseline and five off-target
  sonications). (E) Mean (+ /− SEM) VEP peak-to-peak amplitude at baseline, LGN2,
  and pooled control sonication blocks LGN-TUS. The mean VEP amplitude during the
  second LGN sonication was significantly decreased compared to Sham VEP amplitudes
  (**p = 0.006, ***p = 0.0007, paired one-tailed t-test, N = 6 LGN, N = 5 Sham). (F)
  Same as E, for Sham animals. All comparisons nonsignificant in F, however, there
  is a significance difference between center bars in (E) and (F) figures (**p = 0.008).
