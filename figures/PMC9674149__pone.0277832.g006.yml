caption: 'A: GO enrichment analysis: BP, biological process; CC, cellular component;
  MF, molecular function. The abscissa represents the number of enriched genes, while
  the ordinate describes the enriched items. The darker the bar color, the more significant
  the difference between the enriched items. B: KEGG enrichment analysis: the abscissa
  represents the number of enriched genes, while the ordinate represents the enriched
  pathway entries. Many cancer pathways and some common pathways are shown. The size
  of the circle represents the number of enriched genes: the larger the circle, the
  higher the number of enriched genes, and the redder the color, the closer the relationship
  with the enriched entry.'
