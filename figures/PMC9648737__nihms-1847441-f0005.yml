figure_title: Sarcomere alterations result from blocking or activating insulin signaling
caption: (A) Single plane images of larval LL1 muscles where the Z-discs of sarcomeres
  are marked with anti-Sls. Representative genotypes used for images are mef2>lacZ
  (Class 1), mef2>NUAK 548 (Class 2), or mef2>NUAK RNAi (Class 3). Scale bar, 10 μm.
  (B,C) Violin plot (B) or scatter plot (C) of the indicated genotypes. (B) Control
  larvae possess ~12 sarcomeres/100 μm. Overexpression of NUAK or loss of insulin
  signaling reduces the average number of sarcomeres to ~10. Conversely, loss of NUAK
  function or activation of insulin pathway activity causes an increase in sarcomere
  number/100 μm. (C) The trend for sarcomere length is opposite that of sarcomere
  number. Insulin activation causes wider sarcomeres, while blocking insulin decreases
  sarcomere length. (D) mef2 or C57 expression of UAS-NUAK 548 both cause smaller
  pupal body size (left panel) and reduced muscle length (right panel). (E) Overexpression
  of NUAK 548 during larval growth reduces the relative number of sarcomeres (left
  panel) and increases sarcomere length (right panel). For all graphs, Letters indicate
  significant differences between genotypes (p < 0.05).
