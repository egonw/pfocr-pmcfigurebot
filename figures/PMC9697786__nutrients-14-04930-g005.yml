caption: 'FMT from PLE-treated donor mice alters metabolites, alleviates intestinal
  barrier permeability and inhibits liver inflammation in recipient mice with HFD-induced
  MAFLD. (a) Heatmap visualizing the changes in the contents of overlapping biomarkers
  in the serum of the HFD-FMT and HFD+PLE-FMT groups (n = 6). (b) Heatmap visualizing
  the changes in the contents of overlapping biomarkers in the feces of the HFD-FMT
  and HFD+PLE-FMT groups (n = 7). (c) Representative H&E images of the terminal ileum
  of the HFD-FMT and HFD+PLE-FMT groups (n = 7). (d) mRNA expression of zonula occludens-1,
  claudin-4 and occludin in the ileum of the HFD-FMT and HFD+PLE-FMT groups (n = 7).
  (e) Levels of serum LPS, TNFÎ± and IL-6 in the HFD-FMT and HFD+PLE-FMT groups (n
  = 7). (f) mRNA levels of the TLR4-MyD88 signaling pathway in the livers of the HFD-FMT
  and HFD+PLE-FMT groups (n = 7). (g) Protein levels of TLR4 and MyD88 in the livers
  of the HFD-FMT and HFD+PLE-FMT groups (n = 5). p values were calculated using the
  Wilcoxon rank-sum test and corrected using the method described by Benjamini and
  Hochberg, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.01 indicate a significant difference
  between the two groups. HFD-FMT: fecal microbiota transplantation from mice in the
  HFD group and treatment with a high-fat diet; HFD+PLE-FMT: fecal microbiota transplantation
  from mice in the HFD+PLE group and treatment with a high-fat diet.'
