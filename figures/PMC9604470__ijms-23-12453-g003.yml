caption: 'Modulation of STAT3 activation in prefrontal cortex of rats exposed to CMS
  and agomelatine treatment. Protein levels of phosphorylated (Tyr705) and total forms
  of STAT3 were assessed in cytosol (A,C) and in nucleus (B,D). All analyses were
  conducted in prefrontal cortex of rats exposed to CMS and chronic treatment with
  agomelatine. Data, expressed as percentage vs. unstressed rats treated with vehicle
  (No Stress/Vehicle, set at 100%), are mean Â± SEM of at least 7 independent determinations.
  * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001 vs. No Stress/Vehicle; # p < 0.05, ## p <
  0.01 vs. Stress/Vehicle (two-way ANOVA with PLSD).'
