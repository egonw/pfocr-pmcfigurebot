caption: 'Inflammatory signature in untreated patients with ROSAH syndrome. (A) CRP,
  cytokine and chemokine levels in serum (n=7) and plasma (n=5) of untreated patients
  with ROSAH syndrome. Grey zone indicates normal range. (B) Top 10 activated canonical
  pathways predicted based on differentially expressed genes from whole blood RNA
  of untreated adults with ROSAH syndrome (n=4) based on Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.
  Bars denote the different pathways based on Z-scores. CRP, C reactive protein; GM-CSF:
  granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; ROSAH, retinal dystrophy, optic
  nerve oedema, splenomegaly, anhidrosis and headache.'
