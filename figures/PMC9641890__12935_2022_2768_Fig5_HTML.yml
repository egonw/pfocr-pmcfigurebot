caption: CHRNB2 represses EMT-related proteins via ACh-independent mechanisms. A,
  B Downregulating CHRNB2 could ACh-independently increase the expression of multiple
  EMT proteins including N-cadherin, Vimentin, SNAIL1, and SNAIL2 in PANC1. C Overexpressing
  CHRNB2 could ACh-independently decrease the expression of multiple EMT proteins
  including N-cadherin, Vimentin, SNAIL1, and SNAIL2 in T3M4
