caption: MALAT1 regulates the expression of BRF2 which is associated with poor prognosis
  in HCC patients. (a) The correlation between MALAT1 and BRF2 expression was analyzed
  from the TCGA database. (b) TCGA database suggested that BRF2 mRNA level was higher
  in tumour tissues than in normal. (c) BRF2 expression in 41 pairs of HCC tissues
  and normal tissues was examined by qRT-PCR. (d) The correlation between MALAT1 and
  BRF2 expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR in 41 tissue pairs. (e, f) The expression
  level of BRF2 was detected by qRT-PCR and western blot after MALAT1 knockdown. (g)
  IF staining for BRF2 showed the effect of MALAT1 knockdown on BRF2 expression. Scale,
  10 μm. (h, i) Kaplan-Meier curve analysis showed that the mRNA level of BRF2 in
  HCC tissues was negatively correlated with OS and RFS. (j, k) The expression of
  BRF2 in human HCC specimens was detected by IHC. Scale, 50 μm. (l, m) Kaplan-Meier
  curve analysis of TMA patients showed that HCC patients with high BRF2 expression
  had lower OS and RFS.
