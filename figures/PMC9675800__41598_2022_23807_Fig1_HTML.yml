caption: The pyrimidine metabolic pathway of Plasmodium falciparum. (A) The pathway
  is initiated by carbamoyl-phosphate synthase II (CPSII) that generates carbamoyl-phosphate.
  Carbamoylphosphate is turned into an N-carbamoyl-L-aspartate by aspartate-transcarbamoylase
  (ATCase). N-carbamoyl-phosphate is cyclized by dihydroorotase (DHOase) to generate
  dihydroorotate, that is oxidized by the mitochondrial electron transport chain protein
  dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). Finally, an enzyme complex of orotate phosphoribosyl
  transferase (OPRT) and orotate-5′-monophosphate decarboxylase (OMPDC) turns orotate
  into orotate-5′-monophosphate (OMP) and immediately decarboxylates it into uridine-5′-monoposphate
  (UMP). This concludes the early stages of the pyrimidine metabolism, where it branches
  into the separate thymidine and cytidine biosynthetic processes. For thymidine,
  UMP is phosphorylated to UDP, then UDP is oxidized by ribonucleotide reductase (RNR)
  to generate deoxy-UDP (dUDP). dUDP is phosphorylated to dUTP and then it is dephosphorylated
  to dUMP by the enzyme dUTPase, an essential enzyme to maintain low dUTP levels.
  Finally, dUMP is turned into thymidine-5′-phosphate (dTMP) by the bifunctional thymidylate
  synthase-dihydrofolate reductase (TS-DHFR), that is then turned into dTTP in consecutive
  phosphorylation steps by thymidylate kinase (TK) and nucleotide diphosphate kinase
  (NDPK). For the cytidine biosynthesis, the sole pathway is through the amination
  of UTP to cytidine-5′-triphosphate (CTP) by CTP synthase (CTPS). The CTP first must
  be dephosphorylated into CDP by the nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) to be turned
  into deoxy-CDP (dCDP) by the RNR enzyme and phosphorylated back to dCTP consecutively.
  Dashed lines indicate consecutive phosphorylation steps. Red asterisk marks the
  enzyme target of WR99210 in the pathway. (B,C) Transcriptomic analysis of the early
  (B) and late (C) enzymes in the pyrimidine metabolic pathways. Transcriptomic data
  has been gathered from the database generated by Toenhake et al. and reorganized
  in an orderly manner. Values are shown in fragments per kilobase of exon per million
  mapped fragments (FPKM) as a measure of expression levels. Green, yellow and red
  background indicates the stages which we considered to be ring, trophozoite and
  schizont stages in this study, respectively. The red dashed vertical line shows
  the peak expression of early and late-stage enzymes, except for CTP synthase (CTPS)
  that has an earlier peak at 25 h post-invasion, highlighted by the red plot.
