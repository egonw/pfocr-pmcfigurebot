figure_title: Neurotrophin signaling is a key pathway dysregulated post-IR
caption: A Representative H&E staining of control and IR human SMG and PG. Areas in
  dotted boxes of IR SMG and IR PG are enlarged in right two panels to highlight increased
  adiposity (a), immune infiltration (i), and fibrosis (f). B PCA plot of log-transformed
  CPM counts from bulk RNAseq analysis of human biopsies. C Heatmaps of the top 50
  DEGs by fold change in irradiated glands compared to controls. The color scale represents
  scaled gene expression values. *Long non-coding RNAs, small nuclear RNAs, SNORAs,
  and other pseudogenes were overrepresented among downregulated genes and were removed
  from heatmap (see Supplementary Data  for complete list); a representative expression
  profile is shown at the bottom of the heatmaps. D Bar graph with fold change gene
  expression of selected genes in irradiated glands (n = 6 IR-SMG; n = 5 IR-PG) compared
  to controls from RNAseq analysis. Stars denote statistical significance (adjusted
  p < 0.05, statistical analysis with EdgeR-DeSeq2 (Wald test p-value and Benjamini-Hochberg
  adjusted p-value)). E Results from Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) Software showing
  common pathways dysregulated in PG and SMG. A combined score was calculated by adding
  the –Log(p-val) for a given pathway in both glands. The Venn diagram highlights
  the overlap of genes associated with the top dysregulated pathways. * NGF and NTRK1
  were only significant in IR-SMG and NTRK3 in IR-PG. F Heatmap showing results from
  Upstream Regulator analysis with IPA. Only genes that met the criteria for significance
  in our dataset (p-value < 0.05 and fold change > 2) and that were predicted to be
  upstream of DEGs in both glands are shown. Analysis was adjusted to only predict
  genes annotated to function as growth factors, receptors, and transcription factors,
  based on IPA’s database.
