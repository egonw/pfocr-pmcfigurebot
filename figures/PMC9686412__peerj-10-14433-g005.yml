figure_title: Anti-inflammatory effect of Monarda didyma essential oil on miR-146a,
  IRAK-1 and IL-6 expression levels in U937 cells
caption: 'Both experimental groups treated with the essential oil (LPS + MdEO and
  MdEO,) showed miR-146a up-regulation (A) with a decreased expression of IRAK-1 and
  IL-6 (B and C). Results are reported as fold change related to CTRL. CTRL: controls;
  LPS: LPS-stimulated cells (1 µg/mL final concentration); LPS + MdEO: cells treated
  with MdEO (0.5 µL/mL final concentration) 1 h before LPS stimulation (1 µg/mL final
  concentration); MdEO: cells treated with the essential oil (0.5 µL/mL final concentration).
  Two-tailed paired Student’s t-test: *p < 0.05 vs CTRL; °p < 0.05 vs LPS. TLR-4 signaling
  pathway is illustrated in panel D. Red arrow: negative interaction; Green arrow:
  positive interaction.'
