caption: Niche of T cell selection and development. (a) In bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic
  stem cells differentiate to multipotent progenitor (MPP) that subsequently derived
  to subset called early lymphoid progenitors (ELP) or lymphoid primed multipotent
  progenitors (LMPP). LMPP differentiate into further downstream developmental stages,
  common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) that migrates from the bone marrow compartments
  into thymus through blood stream via the action of chemokines, cell adhesion molecules,
  and CCL25/CCR9, CCL19-CCL21/CCR7 receptors; (b) Cortical DP cells that express αβTCR
  interacting with MHC molecules presenting on edoncortical thymic epithelial cells
  (cTECs), receive critical survival signals that are required to further process
  of differentiation. In other words, T cells election and acquisition of MHC restrictions
  referred to as positive selection. Double positive (DP) cells begin expressing the
  chemokine receptor CCR7 and migrate to the thymic medulla. In the medulla, TCRs-DP
  T cells interact with antigen-presenting cells, such as mTECs and dendritic cells,
  and differentiate into CD4 or CD8 single-positive (SP). The interactions of high-affinity
  T cells TCRs to self-peptide MHC, normally result in either deleted of autoreactive
  cells by apoptosis that referred to negative selection or destined to become regulatory
  T cells through undergoing agonist selections; (c) Phases of early T cell development.
  ETPs in thymus undergo three distinct phases based on the status of T lineage commitment
  and NOTCH dependency; (c.1) Thymus stroma secrets cytokines that act as transcriptional
  factors include IL-7, FLT3, and cKit. These cytokines initiate the expression of
  some genes, such as GATA3, Hes1, and Tcf, through activation of NOTCH signalling
  pathway; (c.2) these genes beside RUNX1 promote expansion of pre-commitment precursor
  as well as turn on transcriptional repressor Bcl11b in the late DN2a; (c.3) T cell
  passes from cell commitment and characterized with NOTCH-dependent, slow proliferation
  and TCR rearrangement. BCL11B turns on leads to c-Kit down-regulation, IL-7R signalling
  desensitization by E proteins, and DN2b cells survival become strictly NOTCH-dependent.
  E protein-dependent genes are recombination activating gene 1 (Rag1), Rag2, as well
  as Ptcra (encoding pre-TCRɑ), Cd3e (encoding CD3), and TCRβ (or TCRϒ and TCRδ) gene
  rearrangement; (c.4) Achieved V(D)J rearrangement for the TCRβ gene, express pre-TCR
  and the cells proceed to the DN3b stage after completion of β-selection, followed
  by transition into DN3/4 and cells gaining ability to receive signals through pre-TCR,
  transition from Notch-dependent to Notch-independent and leads to rapidly turning
  off Notch target genes and IL-7R expression; (c.5) Cells transition into DP (CD4+
  CD8+); (c.6) TCRα gene in DP rearrangement differentiates into SP cells, expressing
  ɑβTCR, by the action of chemokine signalling, such as CXCL12/CXCR4, and up-regulation
  of new transcription factors; IKZF3 (Aiolos) and RORϒt.
