caption: Deactivation of 8 genes to enhance riboflavin-mediated EET via multiplexed
  base editing. (a) Schematic illustration of multiplex engineered strains with deactivated
  genes. “+” stands for deactivating of corresponding gene or harboring corresponding
  plasmid. WT represents the wild type S. oneidensis MR-1. PYYDT-C5 represents PYYDT
  plasmid with ribADEHC, a gene cluster encoding riboflavin biosynthetic pathway originated
  from Bacillus subtilis. The riboflavin biosynthesis pathway was shown in . HRF,
  high-production riboflavin. (b) Power density output curves obtained by linear sweep
  voltammetry (LSV) with a scan rate of 0.1 mV/s. The maximum power densities of multiplex
  engineered strains were shown in .
