caption: The effects of BRHE on the protein (A,B) and mRNA expression (C,D) of iNOS
  and COX-2 in RAW 264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages. The cells were treated
  with BRHE (200, 100, or 50 μg/mL) or LPS (0.5 μg/mL) for 20 or 6 h. Representative
  pictures of Western blot or qPCR and quantitative analysis of blots. Each immunoreactive
  band was digitized and expressed as a ratio of β-actin levels. The data are expressed
  as mean ± SD of three independent experiments. ** p < 0.01, versus LPS treatment
  alone.
