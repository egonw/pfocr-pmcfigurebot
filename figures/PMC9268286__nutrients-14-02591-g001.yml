caption: 'L-arginine induces the accumulation of GSDMD in endoplasmic reticulum of
  acinar cells. (a,c) Representative immunofluorescence staining of GSDMD (red), CALNEXIN
  (green) and DAPI (dark blue) in acinar cells (n = 3). Scale bars, 100 μm. (b,d)
  The expressions of GSDMD, CALNEXIN and β-Actin in endoplasmic reticulum were analyzed
  by Western blot (n = 3). All values were shown as the mean ± SEM, #p < 0.05 compared
  with control group. Unpaired Student’s t-tests were used in (c,d).'
