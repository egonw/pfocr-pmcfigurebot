caption: Biological pathways predicted as regulated by miRNAs exclusive to OF-EVs
  and UF-EVs. A Pathways predicted as regulated by miRNAs exclusive to OF-EVs. B Pathways
  predicted as regulated by miRNAs exclusive UF-EVs. The left Y-axis values represent
  the percentage of genes predicted as modulated by the miRNAs for the respective
  pathways (number of genes predicted to be modulated by miRNAs in each group divided
  by the total number of genes of each pathway). The right Y-axis represents the enrichment
  score (P-value) for each interaction. Blue squares highlight functions with potential
  relevance for embryo development. Pathways were accessed through miRWalk 3.0 database

  signaling pathways related to lipid metabolism and bovine early embryo development.
