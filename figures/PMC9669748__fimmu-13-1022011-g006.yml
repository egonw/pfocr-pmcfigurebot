caption: Survivor mice cured by NBTXR3 and NF-αCTLA4 mediated immunoradiotherapy upgrade
  immune response to prevent tumor relapse. (A) Comparison of immune pathway activities
  of survivor and control mice. (B) Differences in immune-related gene expression
  in survivor mice relative to the control. (C) Immune pathway activities in survivor
  mice before and post tumor rechallenge. (D) Immune cell abundance in survivor mice
  before and post tumor rechallenge. The survivor mice in the NBTXR3+XRT+NF-αCTLA4+αPD1
  group were rechallenged with 344SQR cells 156 days post the last radiation fraction.
  RNA from blood harvested 20 days before, 7 and 21 days post tumor rechallenge were
  analyzed by NanoString.
