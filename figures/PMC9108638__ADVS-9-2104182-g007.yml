caption: 'A) Flow cytometry determination of 4T1 cell apoptosis/necrosis 12 h after
  treatment. B) Statistical analysis of (A). C) CLSM detection of CRT exposure in
  4T1 cell samples after treatment with different laser temperatures. Scale bar: 50
  µm. D) Flow cytometry analysis of CRT, n = 3. E) CLSM images showing HMGB1 release
  from nucleus (red line indicates colocalization analysis position). Scale bar: 50
  µm. F) Colocalization analysis of images in (E). G) ATP secretion profiles from
  4T1 cells after treatment with different temperatures. H) Adenosine levels in 4T1‐cell
  culture medium after irradiation at 48 °C, n = 3. I) ELISA detection of tumor adenosine
  levels after PTT treatment. Normal: normal tissue; Tumor: control tumor without
  treatment (n = 3). The expression level of intracellular cAMP on J) DCs, K) macrophages,
  and L) T cells after indicated treatments. Data are expressed as the means ± SD.
  Statistical significance is defined as *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 and ns
  represents no significant difference.'
