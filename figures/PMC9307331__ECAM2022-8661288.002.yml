caption: 'Loureirin A suppresses the migration of TGF-β1-induced KFs. (a, b) KFs were
  seeded in 6-well plates and separated into three groups: control (10% FBS), TGF-β1
  (40 ng/ml) and LA (50 μg/ml) + TGF-β1 (40 ng/ml). The cell monolayer was scratched,
  and the filling of the scratched areas by migrated KFs was observed at 48 h postscratching
  and quantified using IPP software. The data are presented as the mean ± SEM. ##P
  < 0.01 compared with the control group. ∗∗P < 0.01 compared with the TGF-β1 group.
  Each assay was performed in triplicate and repeated using four independent cell
  samples (n = 4, 12 samples).'
