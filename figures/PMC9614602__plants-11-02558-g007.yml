caption: Expression analysis of target genes of identified three known miRNAs in T1,
  T3, and T5 samples of Swarnaprabha (SW) and IR8 with respect to control. (A) Rolled
  leaf-1 expression, a target of miRNA osa-miRNA166c-3P, (B) chlorophyll a-b-binding
  protein, a target of miRNA osa-miR2102-3p, (C) ubiquinone biosynthesis protein COQ4,
  a target of miRNA osa-miR530-3p. Each gene was amplified using gene-specific primers
  designed using Primer Blast Tool. Actin was taken as an internal positive control.
  The primer sequences are provided in . Error bars are Â±SD of the average of three
  qRT-PCR replicates.
