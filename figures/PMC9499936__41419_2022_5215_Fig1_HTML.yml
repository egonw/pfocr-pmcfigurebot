figure_title: Over-expression of CTSK-associated IL-17A in castration-resistant prostate
  cancer
caption: A Principle description of the work procedure used to study the “IL-17A/CTSK”
  axis in CRPC. The expression profiles data of various types of prostate cancer (#GSE70770,
  GSE32982 and GSE32269). B Heatmap of 23 up-regulated genes and 85 down-regulated
  genes mined from GSE70770, GSE32982 and GSE32269. The lower bar shows different
  groups, the pink one represents the group of CRPC and the orange red one represents
  the group of localized PC. C The bar chart shows KEGG pathway enrichment data for
  DEGs. Pink represents up-regulated pathways and blue represents down-regulated pathways.
  D Circle diagram was adopted for further exploration to clarify the expression genes
  involved in the three significantly up-regulated pathways. E Estimate the therapeutic
  values of CTSK by analyzing the ROC curve (p < 0.001).
