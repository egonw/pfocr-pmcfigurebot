figure_title: Canonical pathway profiling of mouse tissues reveals tissue-specific
  oscillating signatures in intermittent fasting
caption: (A) Experimental design. Four metabolic tissues (liver, skeletal muscle [biceps
  femoris], interscapular brown adipose tissue [BAT], and inguinal white adipose tissue
  [WAT]) were collected every 4 h across the light/dark cycle from a single cohort
  of C57BL/6N mice. Six time points were profiled for all these tissues. n = 5 mice/group.(B)
  Heatmaps showing tissue-specific and feeding-regimen-specific oscillatory pathways
  in four metabolic tissues. Cells were shaded according to GSVA scores (blue, downregulated;
  red, upregulated). Six columns in each heatmap from left to right are zeitgeber
  time (ZT) 16, ZT20, ZT0, ZT4, ZT8, and ZT12, respectively. The dark/light cycle
  was indicated by black and white bars (black, dark; white, light). Feeding regimens
  were indicated on the top of each heatmap (each color from light to dark represented
  feeding or fasting duration from 4 to 24 h with a step of 4 h). n = 5 mice/group.(C)
  Tissue-specific dark/light ratio of upregulated pathways under different feeding
  regimens. Data are presented as mean Â± SEM (n = 5 mice/group). AF, acute fasting;
  AL, ad libitum; AR, refeeding after acute fasting; BAT, brown adipose tissue; EODF,
  every-other-day fasting; EODR, every-other-day refeeding; GSVA, gene set variation
  analysis; WAT, white adipose tissue (see also  and  and  and ).
