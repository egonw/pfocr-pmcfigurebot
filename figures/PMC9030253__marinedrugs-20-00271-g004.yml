caption: Apoptosis modulation by phytoplankton toxin in cancer prevention. Phytoplankton
  toxins such as azaspiracid, yessotoxins, and brevetoxins cause intracellular oxidative
  stress, which leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and downregulates the expression
  of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xl and Bcl-2. Similarly, they enhance Bax expression
  to aid apoptosis via release of cytochrome-C, which triggers the formation of apoptosomes,
  leading to caspase 9 and 3 being induced and displaying apoptotic cell death. Microcystins
  and nodularin trigger the induction of caspase and display caspase-dependent apoptotic
  cell death. Moreover, microcystins and nodularin inactivate PP1 and PP2, which leads
  to excessive ROS. Excessive ROS enters into the ATM signaling pathways, which leads
  to DNA damage and displays apoptotic cell death. In addition, yessotoxins, gymnodimine,
  kalkitoxin, and okadaic acid trigger DNA damage, leading to apoptotic cell death.
  Kalkitoxin also induced the activation of caspase 8/10 and caspase 3/7, displaying
  caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death. Moreover, Azaspiracid entered into the JNK
  pathway and displayed apoptotic cell death.
