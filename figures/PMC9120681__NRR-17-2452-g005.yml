caption: 'Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis
  of genes that are co-expressed with Gsto1.Co-expressed and co-cited genes (P-value
  of sample correlation < 0.05, literature correlation > 0.3) were selected as the
  input gene list for KEGG pathway analysis. Thirty-seven KEGG pathways with significant
  enrichments were identified and sorted by enrichment score (–Log (P value)). Gsto1:
  Glutathione S-transferase omega-1.'
