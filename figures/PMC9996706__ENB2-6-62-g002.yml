caption: Optimisation curcumin biosynthesis with the DiPro biosensor, assisted with
  acoustic liquid handling robotics. (a) A synthetic pathway for detection of BDMC
  synthesis from malonyl‐CoA and p‐coumaroyl‐CoA. EcCurA binds to BDMC, generating
  a unique fluorescent output for relative quantitation of pathway activity. Inset
  visual image shows visible fluorescence of cell‐free BDMC reactions, with negative
  controls. (b) Fine‐tuning of cofactors and substrates, and (c) enzymes to maximise
  BDMC fluorescence signal detection with EcCurA. Unless indicated, standard reaction
  conditions contained 1 mM L‐tyrosine, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM malonate, 5 mM ATP, 0.25 mM
  CoA, 1 μM TAL, 1 μM PCL, 1 μM MatB, 25 μM CUS and 25 μM EcCurA. Enzyme levels were
  varied in a 4‐fold dilution series from 16 to 0.0156 μM. Where two enzymes were
  varied, the third enzyme was kept constant at 1 μM. 10 μl reactions were performed
  at 30°C as a technical triplicate repeat, prepared with the liquid handling robot.
  The assay was repeated as two biological repeats to ensure reproducibility
