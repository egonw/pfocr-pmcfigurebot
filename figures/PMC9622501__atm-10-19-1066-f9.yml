caption: The IL-6 signaling pathway was activated in sensitization induced AMR rat
  model. (A) gp130, JAK-1, STAT3, SHP2, and ERK1-2 were detected in each group. (B)
  WB data were analyzed by ImageJ and presented on the statistical graph (n=3). Significant
  differences between each group were marked by ns, P>0.05; *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01
  or ***, P<0.001. AMR, antibody-mediated rejection; WB, Western blot.

  rejection in a rat model of orthotopic liver transplantation.
