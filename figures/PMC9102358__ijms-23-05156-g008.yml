caption: 'JAK and STAT inhibitors affected the RNase 7-downregulated protein expressions
  associated with the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and inflammation in UPEC-infected
  bladder cells in a high-glucose environment. SV-HUC-1 cells were pretreated with
  15 mM glucose and coincubated with/without 25 μg/mL RNase 7, 25 μM JAK inhibitor,
  or 50 μM STAT inhibitor for 24 h, respectively. Then, all the cells were infected
  with UPEC (MOI:100) for following experiments. The definitions of each letter represented
  by the X axis are: C: control; G: with 15 mM glucose pretreatment alone; A: pretreated
  with 25 μg/mL RNase 7; AJ: coincubated with 25 μg/mL RNase 7 and 25 μM JAK inhibitor;
  AS: coincubated with 25 μg/mL RNase 7 and 50 μM STAT inhibitor; J: cells pretreated
  with 25 μM JAK inhibitor alone; S: Cells pretreated with STAT inhibitor alone. The
  picture shown is representative of a typical result. Total protein from all the
  cell groups was collected for detection. (A) Total protein expression of JAK1, JAK2,
  STAT1, STAT3, phosphorylated-STAT1/STAT3, and the inhibitor, SOCS3, TLR4, IL-6,
  and IFN-γ were analyzed using Western blotting. (B) All data were normalized to
  the internal reference β-actin. Results were assessed using a densitometer and quantified
  using ImageJ software (NIH). The results are presented as mean ± SD of three independent
  experiments. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001, compared to
  the 15 mM glucose pretreated infection group. # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, ### p < 0.001,
  compared between the two groups.'
