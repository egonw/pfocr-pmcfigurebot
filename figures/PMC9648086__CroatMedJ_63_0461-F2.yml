caption: Wound-healing and Comet assays. The results are expressed as percentage of
  wound closure, and the area measured at time zero was considered 0% (A) Ornidazole
  inhibits B16F10 melanoma cancer cells migration as determined by wound-healing analysis.
  (B) Wound closure rates (%) at 8 h and 24 h. Ornidazole (400 μg/mL, 800 μg/mL, 1200
  μg/mL) inhibited cell migration by 15%, 60%, and 96%, respectively, in B16F10 cells
  after 24 hours (one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni testing for multiple comparisons.
  Data are shown as the mean ± standard deviation, P < 0.05) (C) DNA damage as measured
  by the Comet assay as a result of treatment with different concentrations of ornidazole
  (400 μg/mL, 800 μg/mL, 1200 μg/mL) for 24, 48, and 72 hours. Olive moment = (tail
  mean-head mean) x % of DNA in the tail (D) Mean tail moment (μm) represents the
  damage distribution in the attached cells. The experiment was done in triplicates,
  and data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Each group was compared with
  the control group (two-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons, Bonferroni test was
  used for post hoc analysis, *** P < 0.001).
