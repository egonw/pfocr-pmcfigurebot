caption: 'Inhibition of HMGB1 decreases the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  and catabolic mediators in rat synovium of CFA induced TMJOA. A) The schematic chart
  for the timeline of treating rats. B) The expression of ADAMTS5, MMP13, IL-1β, IL-6
  and negative controls was detected by immunohistochemistry in the synovium of CFA
  groups, CFA with anti-HMGB1 antibody treatment groups at day 21, or in the control
  synovium; scale bar: 100 μm. C) Quantitative analysis of ADAMTS5, MMP13, IL-1β and
  IL- 6 in the synovium of rats; data are shown as the means with 95% CI and analyzed
  by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), n=5, *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001.'
