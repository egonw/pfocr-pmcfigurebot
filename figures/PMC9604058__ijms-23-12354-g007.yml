caption: MTERF1 regulates the p-AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway in xenograft tumor tissue
  and human clinical samples. (A,B) HT29 cells with MTERF1 overexpression were treated
  with 5 μM oligomycin A (OA) and 300 nM rapamycin (RAPA) to detect the effect on
  ATP levels (A) and cell proliferation (B). (C,D) Protein expression levels of AMPK/mTOR
  signaling pathway-related proteins in xenograft tumor tissue (C) and human clinical
  samples (D). (E) Working model for MTERF1. As proposed in CRC cells, MTERF1 increased
  mitochondrial replication, transcription, and protein synthesis, which enhanced
  mitochondrial OXPHOS and ATP levels, thus promoting mTOR phosphorylation levels
  and finally promoting the occurrence and development of CRC cells. NS represents
  no significant difference. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, two-tailed Stu-dent’s
  t-test. Data represent the mean ± SD from at least three independent biological
  replicates.
