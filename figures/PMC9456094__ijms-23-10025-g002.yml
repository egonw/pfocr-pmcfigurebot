caption: Various mechanisms of PTPN2 in different kinds of cells. Abnormal expression
  of PTPN2 in epithelial cells will result in many diseases through different mechanisms,
  such as p-STAT1/claudin-2 in inflammatory bowel, p38/NF-κB in renal cell damage,
  and JAK/STAT in diabetic periodontitis. The antibody of PTPN2 in APOE−/− mice inhibits
  atherosclerosis through diminishing p65/p38/STAT3 signaling pathway. What’s more,
  PTPN2 influences T cell function, including cell proliferation and IFN-γ production,
  through JAK/STAT signaling pathway.
