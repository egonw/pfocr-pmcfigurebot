caption: 'Effects of HRW on the Nrf-2 signaling pathway in rats with chronic gut inflammation.
  (A) Blot bands of protein expression related to the Nrf-2 signaling pathway. Protein
  levels of the Nrf-2 signaling pathway were detected by Western blotting: (B) Nrf-2;
  (C) HO-1; (D) NQO-1. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 compared to the CON group; # p < 0.05,
  ## p < 0.01 compared to the LPS group. *, # p < 0.05; **, ## p < 0.01. Please view
