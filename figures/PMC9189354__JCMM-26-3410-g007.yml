caption: Knockdown of MIF and SLC3A2 promoted iron death in SW480 and SW620 cells.
  SW480 and SW620 cells were transfected with control shRNA (shCon group), shMIF (shMIF
  group), shSLC3A2 (shSLC3A2 group) or co‐transfected with shMIF plus shSLC3A2 (shMIF + shSLC3A2 group),
  respectively. (A) GPX4 mRNA expression in SW480 and SW620 cells. (B) GPX4 protein
  expression in SW480 and SW620 cells. (C) Western blotting was performed to confirm
  the levels of GPX4 protein expression in SW480 and SW620 cells. (D) Immunofluorescence
  assays were performed to detect GPX4 protein expression in SW480 and SW620 cells.
  (E) The morphology of mitochondria SW480 and SW620 cells was observed by transmission
  electron microscopy. Mitochondria are shown by red arrows. (F) Detection of ROS
  in SW480 and SW620 cells by flow cytometry. (G) The ratios of GSH/GSSG in cell lysates
  from SW480 and SW620 cells were detected by a biochemical method. ‘*’ means p < 0.05
  when compared with the control group; ‘#’ means p < 0.05 when compared with the
  shCon group. GAPDH served as an invariant internal control for calculating fold
  changes in protein expression
