caption: ISC deficiency induced activation of mTORC1 signaling cascade. (A) Schematic
  of mTOR and AKT signaling pathways in mediating physiological and pathological cardiac
  hypertrophy. mTORC1 signaling cascade balances mRNA translation, protein turnover
  and metabolism, in response to growth factors and nutrient levels, while mTORC2
  regulates cytoskeleton, metabolism and activates several pro-survival pathways,
  including the AKT signaling pathway. In addition to sensing amino acid and glucose
  levels, mTORC1 is a downstream mediator of several growth factor pathways, including
  the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)–phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–AKT
  pathway. In addition to activating mTORC1 signaling, hyperactivated AKT mediates
  the phosphorylation of other regulators of cardiac hypertrophy including GSK3β and
  folkhead transcription factors FOXO. (B) Knockdown (KD) of FXN not only resulted
  in a decreased in functional Fe–S proteins, as indicated by reduced lipoylation
  of DBT, DLST and DLAT by LIAS, decreased levels of respiratory complex II subunit
  SDHB, and decreased acetylation of histones (), but also resulted in increased levels
  of p-S6, p62 and p-Drp1 in human fibroblasts MCH46 compared to cells transfected
  with non-targeting siRNA (NT siRNA). The full, uncropped versions are shown in the
  supplemental data (Figures S4 and 5). (C) KD of ISCU resulted in increased levels
  of p-S6 and p62. The uncropped versions are shown in Figure S6. (D) KD of FXN or
  ISCU resulted in increased levels of p-S6, p-S757-ULK1, ULK1, p-S473-AKT and p-T308-AKT.
  The uncropped versions are shown in Figure S7. (E) Densitometry analysis showed
  an increase in p-S6 levels in FXN or ISCU KD fibroblasts normalized to controls
  (n > 6). (F) Increased levels of p-AKT at S473 in FXN-KD (n = 10) and ISCU-KD (n
  = 5) cells normalized to NT-KD control cells. (G) KD of ISCU increased the levels
  of p-S6, p-S757-ULK1, ULK1, and p-S473-AKT in serum-starved human fibroblasts with
  or without IGF-1 stimulation compared to NT siRNA. The uncropped versions are shown
  in Figure S8. (H) Increased p-ULK1 and ULK1 levels in FXN-KD (n = 4) cells normalized
  to NT-KD control cells. The t-test significance P values are indicated (∗P < 0.05;
  ∗∗P < 0.005). See also Figure S1.
