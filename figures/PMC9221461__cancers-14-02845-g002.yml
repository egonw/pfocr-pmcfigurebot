caption: Construction and evaluation of the prognostic multiple-gene signature. (a)
  LASSO Cox regression coefficients of lncRNA HAR1A-related apoptosis/cell cycle genes.
  (b) Identification of the favorable gene signature using the LASSO model. (c) ROC
  curve analyses of the prognostic model, TNM stage, HAR1A, and indicated combinations.
  (d) Time-dependent receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves trained on the
  risk scores were used to access AUC values for the TCGA-LUAD cohort, evaluating
  the overall accuracy of the model. (e) Kaplanâ€“Meier survival curves of overall survival
  (OS) time between high- and low-risk patients. (f) The distribution of the risk
  score and survival status indicates that the survival time of patients descends
  while the risk scores are increasing.
