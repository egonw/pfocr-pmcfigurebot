caption: IL-17D activates p38 MAPK signaling pathway in lung cancer. (A) Volcano plot
  assessment of mRNA expression in A549 cells between IL-17D overexpression and control
  groups. (B) Significantly enriched KEGG pathways relative to differentially expressed
  mRNAs upon IL-17D overexpression. Y-axis represents pathways; X-axis represents
  the amount of the mRNAs enriched in KEGG pathways. (C) Immunoblots showing the expression
  of p38, p-p38, Flag and β-actin. Left, A549 cells were transduced with IL-17D or
  empty vector. Right, LLC1 cells were transduced with IL-17D or empty vector. (D)
  Immunoblots showing the expression of p38, p-p38, IL-17D and β-actin. H1155 cells
  were transduced with control or shRNAs against IL-17D. (E) Immunostaining of IL-17D
  and p-p38 in human lung cancer tissues. Scale bars are 20 μm. (F) Semiquantitative
  analysis of immunostaining revealed that IL-17D scores were associated with p-p38
  scores (r = 0.5998, P < 0.0001).
