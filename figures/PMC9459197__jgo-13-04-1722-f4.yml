caption: 'Similar to luteolin, the anti-IL-6 antibody reversed the effects of IL-6
  on M1 polarization. (A) CCK-8 assay showed the impact of IL-6/anti-IL-6 antibody
  on the proliferation rate of SW480 and SW620 cells treated with luteolin. (B) Transwell
  assay showed the impact of IL-6/anti-IL-6 antibody on the migration and invasion
  of SW480 and SW620 cells treated with luteolin. Cells were stained with crystal
  violet. (C) Western blot analysis showing the impact of IL-6/anti-IL-6 antibody
  on the phosphorylation level of STAT3 treated with luteolin. *, anti-IL-6 group
  vs. LPS + luteolin group, P<0.05; #, anti-IL-6 group vs. IL-6 group, P<0.05. IL-6,
  interleukin 6; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; CCK-8,
  Cell Counting Kit-8.'
