caption: RICORS2040 concept and overall structure and research aims. RICORS2040 aims
  at improving kidney and person outcomes in both men and women with CKD. There are
  two set of aims. The first set aims at improving the diagnosis and management of
  the most common causes of CKD to prevent or delay CKD progression. For this, the
  main causes of native kidney CKD (diabetes, glomerular, inherited/genetic) will
  be addressed, and the accelerated kidney aging concept will be explored as a final
  common pathway of CKD progression and as a potential cause of CKD in persons in
  whom no other cause is identified. Since the life expectancy of kidney allografts
  is markedly shorter than for native kidneys, chronic allograft dysfunction will
  also be explored. The second set aims to improve person outcomes by optimizing the
  diagnosis and management of the consequences of CKD (or of kidney transplantation
  therapy) on other organs and systems, what we have collectively named as the accelerated
  biological aging of CKD. Please note that aim 4 is focused on accelerated kidney
  aging as a cause of CKD and on kidney events, while aim 6 is focused on the impact
  of CKD on other organs and systems, that is, on accelerated biological aging of
  diverse organs and systems occurring as a consequence of CKD. Care will be taken
  to identify and optimize the management of gender-related issues and provide clinical
  guidance with specific information for men and for women. Reproduced from 1.
