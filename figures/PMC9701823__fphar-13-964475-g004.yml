caption: 'The expression level of TRPV1 was upregulated after OEA treatment. (A,B)
  Semi-quantitative analysis revealed that OEA pretreatment reduced the expression
  level of TRPV1 protein in diabetic myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury rats.
  (C,D) Semi-quantitative analysis indicated that OEA pretreatment decreased the expression
  level of TRPV1 protein in H9C2 cells. (E) IF results showed immunofluorescence staining
  of cells in each group with DAPI fluorescent-labeled dye (nucleus, blue) and TRPV1
  (green), scale = 50 μm. Data were expressed as mean ± SEM, ***p < 0.001 vs. DM +
  S group; #p < 0.05 vs. DM + I/R group; δδP <0.01 vs. HG group; ♦p < 0.05 vs. HG
  + OGD/R group.'
