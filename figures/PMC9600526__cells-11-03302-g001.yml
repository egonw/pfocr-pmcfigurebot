caption: Combination of Smurf1 suppression with TMZ synthetically inhibits PI3K/Akt
  pathway. (a) The distribution of IC50 score for TMZ in different PTEN status GB
  cell lines. The IC50 for TMZ and PTEN status of cell lines was obtained from the
  largest publicly available pharmacogenomics database (the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity
  in Cancer (GDSC), https://www.cancerrxgene.org/ (accessed on 19 September 2022)).
  PTEN wild-type group (wild type) included 8-MGBA, DBTRG05MG, SF268, GB-1, AM38,
  KS1, SNB75, YH13, LN18, LN229, DKMG, SW1088, U343, T98G, Becker, SK-MG-1; PTEN mutant
  group (mutant) included U87, 42-MGBA, M059K, SF126, CAS1, U251, YKG1, U118, SF295,
  LN405, D263, LNZTA3WT4, D392-MG, D-542MG, D-247MG, D-566MG, D-423MG. (b) The distribution
  of IC50 score for TMZ in different PTEN status GB patients. RNA-sequencing expression
  (level 3) profiles and corresponding clinical information for GB cases were downloaded
  from the TCGA dataset (https://portal.gdc.com (accessed on 20 September 2022)).
  The GB cases were divided into PTEN wild-type group (Wild type, n = 102) and PTEN
  mutant group (mutant, n = 47). Predicted the chemotherapeutic response for each
  sample based on GDSC. The prediction process was implemented by R package “pRRophetic”.
  The samples’ half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was estimated by ridge
  regression. All parameters were set as the default values. Using the batch effect
  of combat and tissue type of all tissues, the duplicate gene expression was summarized
  as mean value. The statistical difference between two groups was compared through
  the Wilcox test. (c) Kaplan–Meier survival analysis of the gene signature from TCGA
  dataset, comparison among different groups was made by log-rank test (** p = 0.034
  was considered statistically significant). The timeROC (v 0.4) analysis was used
  to compare the predictive accuracy of Smurf1 mRNA. Median time represents the time
  corresponding to the survival rate of 50% (i.e., the median survival time) in the
  high-expression group (0.9 years) and the low-expression group (1.25 years). (d)
  Cell viability was measured after the indicated time treatment with DMSO or TMZ
  (250 μM) in different GB cells (LN229, U87, U251, U343) using MTT assay. (e) LN229,
  U343, U251, and U87 were cultured in the absence or presence of TMZ (250 μM) for
  the indicated time. The whole-cell lysates were examined through Western blotting
  for the expression of p-mTORS2448/mTOR, p-AktS473/Akt, p-p70S6KT389/p70S6K, and
  β-actin proteins. (f) Kaplan–Meier survival analysis of the gene signature from
  TCGA dataset, comparison among different groups was made by log-rank test (** p
  = 0.00902 was considered statistically significant). The timeROC (v 0.4) analysis
  was used to compare the predictive accuracy of Smurf1 mRNA. Median time represents
  the time corresponding to the survival rate of 50% (i.e., the median survival time)
  in the high-expression group (0.9 years) and the low-expression group (1.6 years).
  All the analysis methods and R packages were implemented by R (foundation for statistical
  computing 2020) version 4.0.3. (g) MTT assay revealed the effect of Smurf1 knockdown
  on LN229, U343, U251, and U87 cells with DMSO or TMZ (250 μM, 48 h) treatment. (h,i)
  LN229 (h) and U251 (i) were transfected with si-Control or si-Smurf1 and then treated
  with DMSO or TMZ (250 μM, 48 h). Western blotting was employed to detect target
  proteins p-mTORS2448/mTOR, p-AktS473/Akt, p-p70S6KT389/p70S6K, PTEN, Smurf1, and
  β-actin. (j) U251 with Flag-PTENK289E was transfected with si-Control or si-Smurf1
  and then treated with DMSO or TMZ (250 μM, 48 h). Western blotting was employed
  to detect target proteins p-mTORS2448/mTOR, p-AktS473/Akt, p-p70S6KT389/p70S6K,
  Flag, Smurf1, and β-actin proteins. (k) U251 with Flag or Flag-PTENK289E was transfected
  with si-Control or si-Smurf1 and then treated with DMSO or TMZ (250 μM, 48 h). The
  number of cells in each group were counted. In (e,h–j), Western blot analysis was
  performed in n = 3 biological replicates. In (d,g,k), data are presented as mean
  ± SD of three separate experiments, NS p > 0.05, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p
  < 0.001 as determined by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test.
