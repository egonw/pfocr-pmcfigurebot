caption: Apigenin activated the MAPK signaling pathway in cSCC in vitro. (a, b) Variation
  of the MAPK signaling pathway with the treatment of apigenin in TPA-induced JB6
  (a) and A431 cells (b). The cells were treated with 80 μM apigenin for different
  time points up to 24 h. Western blot was applied to analyze the expression of MAPK
  pathway-associated proteins, includingp38, ERK1/2 and JNK compared with GAPDH (left).
  The bar graph on the right showed the intensity of the phosphorylation protein band
  from each treatment relative to the total protein. Valued represent the means ±
  SEM. Significant difference was designed by ANOVA, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p <
  0.001, and ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001vs. control (TPA-induced sample as control for JB6 cells).
  (c) TPA-induced JB6 cell was incubated with control (DMSO, TPA-alone, and apigenin-alone)
  or apigenin (40 or 80 μM) for indicted time points. Western blot was served to analyze
  the expression of Nrf2. β-Actin was used as the reference for the loading quantity
  of protein sample. The bar graph indicated the density quantification of the Nrf2
  band relative to β-actin. ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗∗p < 0.001vs. TPA-induced control by ANOVA.
