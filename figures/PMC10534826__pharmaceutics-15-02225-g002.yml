caption: Changes in metabolites and enzymes of glycolysis, TCA, and glutaminolysis
  due to morphine treatment. There is consensus among studies regarding increased
  glucose transport into the cell, upregulation of LDH-A, and decreased expression/activity
  of PK, but the remaining steps of glycolysis display variable patterns of upregulation
  and downregulation by morphine. Three separate studies have found that morphine
  decreases malate dehydrogenase expression; however, the change in other enzymes
  and metabolites of the TCA vary within the literature. Glutamine metabolism, or
  glutaminolysis, directly feeds into the TCA through α-ketoglutarate production.
  Morphine and other opioids affect glutaminolysis metabolites and enzymes, yet conflicting
  findings exist about whether they amplify or diminish this metabolic pathway. Directionality
  of change in metabolite or protein is indicated in the brackets preceding study
  authorship. “+” indicates an increase in either activity, expression, or level,
  while “-” indicates a decrease in the aforementioned parameters. HK—hexokinase;
  GK—glucokinase; PGI—phosphoglucose isomerase; PFK—phosphofructokinase; ALDO—aldolase;
  DHAP—dihydroxyacetone phosphate; TPI—triosephosphate isomerase; GAPDH—glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; PGK—phosphoglycerate kinase; PGM—phosphoglycerate mutase; ENO—enolase;
  PK—pyruvate kinase; LDH-A—lactate dehydrogenase A; PD—pyruvate dehydrogenase; PC—pyruvate
  carboxylase; CS—citrate synthase; AH—aconitase or aconitate hydratase; IDH—isocitrate
  dehydrogenase; a-KGD—α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase; SCoAS—succinyl CoA synthetase;
  SD—succinate dehydrogenase; FH—fumarase or fumarate hydratase; MD—malate dehydrogenase;
  GLS—glutaminase; GS—glutamine synthase; GDH—glutamate dehydrogenase (also known
  as glutamic acid decarboxylase); OXPHOS—oxidative phosphorylation; PPP—pentose phosphate
  pathway [,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,].
