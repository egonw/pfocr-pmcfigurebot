figure_title: RA signalling modulates Aregs' anti‐adipogenic property
caption: 'ABulk RNA‐seq‐derived expression plots of Rbp1 (Retinol‐binding protein
  1) and Aldh1a2 (coding for Retinal dehydrogenase, RALDH2) in freshly isolated total,
  CD142− and CD142+ ASPCs, n = 4–7, 1–5 biological replicates, 1–4 independent wells
  for each.BExpression heatmap listing genes linked to “retinol metabolic process”
  (GO:0042572) across bulk RNA‐seq samples of freshly isolated CD142− and CD142+ ASPCs;
  genes identified as lead by GSEA () are coloured in red; log normalised expression
  scaled by row.CExpression heatmap of the lead genes identified by GSEA of the significantly
  enriched terms “cellular response to RA” (GO:0071300) and “RA receptor signalling
  pathway” (GO:0048384); GSEA identified these two terms as enriched when performed
  on the genes driving PC1 shown in Fig ; see colour legend at the bottom of the figure.DCorrelation
  plot of “RA score” (RAS; based on the expression of genes linked to “cellular response
  to RA” (GO:0071300) and “RA receptor signalling pathway” (GO:0048384)) versus “CD142+
  score” (Appendix Table ) or “white fat cell differentiation score” (WFCDS; GO:0050872).EVolcano
  plot showing the coefficient of the linear regression performed between “RA score”
  (RAS; based on the expression of genes linked to “cellular response to RA” (GO:0071300)
  and “RA receptor signalling pathway” (GO:0048384)) and log normalised gene expression
  (RAS ~ log(normalised expression)) (x‐axis) versus the −log10(P‐value) (y‐axis);
  top CD142+ markers (i.e., Areg markers, Appendix Table ) are highlighted in blue.FBoxplots
  showing the distribution of the log normalised expression of F3 (top) or Mgp (bottom)
  across transcriptomic data of CD142− ASPCs treated with an adipogenic cocktail supplemented
  with DMSO or different concentrations of RA (0.01–100 μM); the indicated significance
  is based on the result of differential expression analysis between all RA treated
  samples or samples treated with RA of a concentration between 0.01 and 1 μM versus
  controls (treatment with differentiation cocktail with or without DMSO), n = 2–4,
  2–4 biological replicates, 1 independent well for each.GRepresentative fluorescence
  microscopy images of CD142− ASPCs, co‐cultured with CD142+ ASPCs (Aregs; in the
  top well) subjected to the indicated compounds at the indicated concentrations;
  AGN and BMS are antagonists of RAR, DEAB is an antagonist of RALDH enzymes which
  convert retinaldehyde to RA, and HX is an antagonist of RXR.HFraction of differentiated
  CD142− ASPCs indicated in (G), as quantified by the “adiposcore”; marker shapes
  correspond to different biological replicates, n = 4–15, 2–5 biological replicates,
  2–3 independent wells for each.IRepresentative fluorescence microscopy images of
  CD142− ASPCs, co‐cultured with CD142+ ASPCs (Aregs) subjected to control (scr) or
  siRNA‐mediated knockdowns of selected RA signalling pathway genes: Rara, Rarb, Rarg,
  Rbp1 and Rxrg after adipogenic differentiation (i.e., after exposure to an adipogenic
  cocktail, ).JFraction of differentiated CD142− ASPCs indicated in (I), as quantified
  by the “adiposcore”; marker shapes correspond to different biological replicates,
  n = 24–29, 4 biological replicates, 5–8 independent wells for each. Data information:
  In all images, nuclei are stained with Hoechst (blue) and lipids are stained with
  Bodipy (yellow); scale bars, 100 μm. *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001, pairwise
  two‐sided t‐test (H–J), or one‐way ANOVA and Tukey HSD post hoc test (A) for statistical
