caption: Trip13 KD results in lipid droplet accumulation through activation of the
  insulin signaling pathway. A) Representative images of HLF and Huh7 cells transfected
  with siControl or siTrip13 showing lipid droplet accumulation. Green (bodipy), blue
  (DAPI) (n = 3). B) Quantification of the proportion of HLF and Huh7 cells displaying
  lipid droplets under control and Trip13 KD conditions (n = 3). C) Immunofluorescence
  images of Trip13 KD HLF cells showing lipid droplets in interphase and in mitosis.
  Red (Aurora kinase A), blue (DAPI) (n = 3). D) Western blot analysis of Trip13 KD
  HLF cells synchronized in G2 or mitosis, showing levels of Akt phosphorylation.
  E) Levels of Akt phosphorylation in Trip13 KD HLF cells before and 15 min or 24 h
  after insulin treatment (10 or 100 nm) (n = 3). F) Western blot of HLF transfected
  with siTrip13 alone or in combination with siInsulin receptor (IR) showing levels
  of pAkt before and after 15 min treatment with insulin 10 nm (n = 3). G) Western
  blot of HLF transfected as in (F), showing levels of pAkt before and after 15 min
  treatment with 10 nm IGF or EGF subsequent 24 h total serum starvation (0% FBS)
  (n = 3). H) Levels of pAkt in Trip13 KD HLF cells before and 15 min after 10% serum
  stimulation in combination with 10 µg mL−1 of insulin receptor blocking antibody
  (n = 3). I) Western blot showing levels of pAkt and cleaved caspase 3, and J) growth
  curve of HLF cells with KD for Trip13 and/or insulin receptor (n = 3). K) Mitotic
  index of cells transfected as in (I) (n = 3). L) CoIP of insulin receptor and Mad2
  in HLF cells transfected with siControl or siTrip13 (n = 3). All data in the figure
  are shown as the mean ± SEM. n numbers refer to biological replicates. (K) 1‐way
  ANOVA with Tukey's Multiple Comparison test. (B) Student's t‐test. *p < 0.05, **p
  < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
