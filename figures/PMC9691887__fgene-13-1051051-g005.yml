caption: (Continued). Exploration of IMS characteristic in single-cell RNA sequencing
  database. (A) UMAP plot of selected 6435 single cells in immune cells (CD45 positive).
  Different colors represent different cell types. (B) UMAP plot shows the expression
  of nine genes in IMS classifier. (C) UMAP plot of selected 6435 single cells in
  immune cells (CD45 positive). Twelve cell clusters were divided into eight cell
  types. (D) Kaplan–Meier plot displays significant differences of survival rate among
  high-IMS proportion and low-IMS proportion in TCGA cohorts. MuSic Deconvolution
  method. High group was more favorable than low group, unit of time (years). (E)
  The differential immune–immune cellular communication weight coefficient shows IMS
  cross-talk between all immune cell type. (F) The heatmap of immune–immune cellular
  communication shows the counts of IMS cross-talk between all immune cell types.
  (G) Communication network of the significant ligand–receptor pairs between IMS and
  other immune cell types, which contribute to the signaling from IMS to memory B
  cell, dendritic cell, CD14+ monocyte cell, CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, CD4+ memory
  T cell, and NK cell subpopulations. Dot color reflects communication probabilities
  and dot size represents computed p-values. Empty space means the communication probability
  is zero. p-Values are computed from a one-sided permutation test. (H) CD74 and CXCR4
  (MIF) in groups of combined cohorts; high pathway group (387) represents high IMS,
  low pathway group (589) represents low IMS; p = 8.69e-151, p = 2.47e-67. (I) Heatmap
  of metabolic genes’ average expression in different immune cell types. (J) Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis
  pathway distribution plot of all immune cells. (K) Enrichment of immune cell types
  in oxidative phosphorylation and TCA cycle pathways. Dot color reflects enrichment
  probabilities and dot size represents computed p-values. (L) The rank of each immune
  cell-type enrichment in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and
  TCA cycle pathways. The result shows IMS ranked first in the glycolysis/ gluconeogenesis
  and citrate cycle (TCA cycle) pathway but fifth in the oxidative phosphorylation
  pathway. (M) Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway in groups of combined cohorts; high
  pathway group (387) represents high IMS, low pathway group (589) represents low
  IMS; p = 1.8e-32. (N) Oxidative phosphorylation and TCA cycle pathway in groups
  of combined cohorts; high pathway group (387) represents high IMS, low pathway group
  (589) represents low IMS; p = 1.49e-25, p = 4.09e-228.
