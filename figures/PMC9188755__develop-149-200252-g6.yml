caption: Two scenarios for the evolution of the anterior mesoderm in chordates. (A,B)
  Schematics of embryos at the early somitogenesis stage are presented as dorsal views
  with anterior towards the top. Arrows correspond to evolutionary steps. Colour coding
  of different mesodermal territories is shown in the key. PM, paraxial mesoderm;
  LPM, lateral plate mesoderm. (A) In this scenario, we considered that the chordate
  ancestor had a prechordal plate-like structure, as observed transiently in amphioxus.
  (B) In this scenario, we considered that the chordate ancestor had neither an anterior
  notochord nor a prechordal plate.
article_title: Functions of the FGF signalling pathway in cephalochordates provide
  insight into the evolution of the prechordal plate.
