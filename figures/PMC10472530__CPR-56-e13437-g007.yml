caption: SSS regulates ISC proliferation and intestinal epithelial repair in Drosophila.
  (A and B) Total sleep (A) and sleep per hour (B) in WT, the sss P1/sss Δ40 and rescued
  flies. Mean and SEM. (C–G) Re‐expression of sss (UAS‐sss) in the neurons (elav‐Gal4),
  neurons (nSyb‐Gal4) and whole body (tub‐Gal4) in sss‐deficient flies rescued the
  ISC proliferation defect. Representative Dl (red; ISC marker) immunofluorescence
  images from the midgut R4 or R5 sections with the indicated genotypes (C)–(G). (H)
  Quantification of the number of pH3+ cells in the gut of flies with the indicated
  genotypes (C)–(G). Each dot corresponds to one gut. Mean and SD. (I) Quantification
  of Dl+ cell ratio per 3.4 × 104 μM2 in the midgut of flies with the indicated genotypes.
  Each dot corresponds to one ROI. Mean and SD. (J) Representative immunofluorescence
  images of the R4 or R5 region of the midgut of the WT and the sss P1/sss Δ40 flies
  in BLM‐0D, BLM‐REC‐1D, and BLM‐REC‐3D. Dl staining (red) identifies ISCs. (K) Quantification
  of pH3+ cell number of flies with the indicated genotypes. Each dot represents one
  gut. Mean and SD. (L) Quantification of the ratio of Dl+ cells per ROI in the midgut
  of the experiment (J). Each dot represents one ROI. Mean and SD. (M and N) ISC division
  rhythm in the 12:12 h LD cycle. ZT is defined by the light signal, with ZT0 pointing
  to lights on and ZT12 pointing to lights off. Line graphs show the trend in pH3+
  cell change in CS flies (blue curve) and sss P1/sss Δ40 flies (red curve) with (N)
  and without (M) BLM treatment. Significant differences are detected between time
  points ZT0 and ZT12 in CS flies (N). Mean and SEM. Scale bar = 10 μm. DAPI‐stained
  nuclei are shown in blue. WT = wild type. Student's t test, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001, NS = not significant.
