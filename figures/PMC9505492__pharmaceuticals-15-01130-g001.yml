caption: 'MgIG attenuates HRZE-induced liver injury. (a) ALT, (b) AST and (c) AKP
  levels of serum; (d) GSH, (e) SOD, and (f) TBARS (represents MDA level) levels of
  liver tissue homogenate in each group (n = 6); (g) representative images of liver
  parenchyma H&E staining in each group, where arrows mean inflammatory cell infiltration
  and lipid vacuoles; (h) pathological scores of liver tissue (n = 3). The data are
  presented as the means ± SEM. Compared with the control group: * p < 0.05, ** p
  < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, and **** p < 0.0001. Compared with the HRZE group: #p < 0.05,
  ##p < 0.01, and ###p < 0.001.'
