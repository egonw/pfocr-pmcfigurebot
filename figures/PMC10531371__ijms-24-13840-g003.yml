caption: 'Effects of MICT and HIIT on metabolic disorders in HFD mice. (A) Experimental
  timeline. (B) Body weight. (C,D) Body composition. (E) Glucose tolerance test (GTT).
  (F) Insulin tolerance test (ITT). (G,H) Serum triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol
  (TC) levels. (I) Representative images (scale bar: 50 μm; Magnification: 20×) and
  quantitative analysis of Oil Red O (ORO) staining of gastrocnemius muscle. Data
  are presented as mean ± SEM. (n = 7 for HFD, n = 7 for MH, n = 8 for HH). # p <
  0.05, ## p < 0.01, ### p < 0.001, #### p < 0.0001 vs. Group HFD, and &&& p < 0.001
  vs. Group MH.'
