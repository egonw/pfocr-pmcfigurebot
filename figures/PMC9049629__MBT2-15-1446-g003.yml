caption: Schematic diagram representing different types of regulation in P. putida
  KT2442/KT2440.A. Positive regulation of phaC1 and phaI expression by PhaF.B. Activation
  of phaC1ZC2D and phaIF transcription by PhaD.C. Negative regulation of phaF by RpoN
  under nitrogen excess condition.D. Regulation of PHA synthesis by PTS system. Non‐phosphorylated
  EIIANtr in ΔptsP or ΔptsO inhibits the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)
  and lowers acetyl‐CoA flux for PHA synthesis. ΔptsN and the ΔptsOΔptsN mutant enhances
  PDH activity and increases PHA synthesis by channelling more acetyl‐CoA.E. Negative
  regulation of phaIF operon by stringent response.F. Proposed negative regulation
  of phaC1 promoter by RpoS.G. Repression of phaC1 expression by Crc protein under
  conditions of nutrient balance.H. Proposed involvement of GacS/GacA system in PHA
  synthesis. Disruption of the gacS sensor kinase reduces transcription rate of the
  entire pha cluster.I. Negative regulation of fatty acid metabolism pathway by PsrA.
  Deletion of psrA genes activates fatty acid metabolism leading to reduced PHA production
  level. The red and dashed red arrows indicate repression and proposed repression
  effects, respectively. The green and dashed green arrows indicate activation and
  proposed activation effects, respectively. The black dashed double arrow represents
  the existence of interaction.
