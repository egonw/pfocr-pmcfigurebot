caption: 'Proteomic analysis of secreted proteins from mouse and human VSMCs. a KEGG
  pathways that were enriched after analysis 2712 MBVSMC-CM specific proteins. b Venn
  diagram of common and exclusive secreted proteins in MBVSMCs and HBVSMCs. Proteins
  with a Sum PEP Score > 1 were chosen. c KEGG pathways that were enriched after analysis
  237 HBVSMC-CM specific proteins. d KEGG pathways that were enriched after analysis
  of 400 common proteins. e–g GO analysis of cellular components (e), molecular function
  (f) and biological processes (g) for 400 genes. The top ten enriched GO terms for
  each cluster are shown. h Protein interaction analyses of the common signaling pathway
  with experimentally confirmed mode (Left panel) and database prediction mode (Right
  panel). The ball color showed the proteins encoding genes come from different collections:
  VSMC-CM secretome collections (Red) and neuron transcriptome collections (Green).
  Line thickness indicated the strength of data support'
