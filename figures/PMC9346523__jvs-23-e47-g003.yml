figure_title: Effects of AS-A2 on RANKL signaling pathway. (A) RAW264.7 cells were
  stimulated with or without RANKL (50 ng/mL) in the presence of AS-A2 for the noted
  times. Western blot was used to look for the phosphorylation of MAPKs in whole-cell
  lysates. (B) The quantitative band density of the phosphorylated protein was adjusted
  to that of β-actin. The results are based on three unrelated experiments. Data are
  presented as mean ± SD of three unrelated experiments

  ligand; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase.*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.
