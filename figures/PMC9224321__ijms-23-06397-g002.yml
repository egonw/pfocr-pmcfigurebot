caption: Allethrin treatment-induced oxidative stress. Pregnant female rats were exposed
  to 34.2 and 68.5 mg of allethrin/kg body weight from Day 6 of gestation until delivery,
  and the levels of MDA (A), GSH (B), SOD (C) and CAT (D) in female offspring were
  then determined during the prepubertal stage. All data are expressed as the means
  Â± SDs. *** p < 0.0005; **** p < 0.00001.
