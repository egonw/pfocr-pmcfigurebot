caption: Activated pathways involved in the pyroptosis-related gene signature by GSEA.
  (A) Cell cycle, (B) ERBB signaling pathway, (C) mTOR signaling pathway, (D) TGF-beta
  signaling pathway, (E) ubiquitin mediated proteolysis and (F) WNT signaling pathway
  were activated in high-risk samples. (G) Autoimmune thyroid disease, (H) cytokine-cytokine
  receptor interaction, (I) primary immunodeficiency, and (J) ribosome were activated
  in low-risk samples.
