caption: 'Overexpression of PC weakened the influences of LINC00092 transfection on
  BC cell functions. Following LINC00092 and PC transfection, (a) PC protein levels
  were tested via western blotting. Cell viabilities (b), proliferation (c), migration
  (d), and invasion (e) were tested via CCK-8 assay, colony formation assay, cell
  scratch assay, and two-chamber transwell assay, respectively. (f, g) Cell lactate
  production and glucose consumption were tested. N = 3. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, and
  ###P < 0.001vs. the mock group; ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. the
  LINC00092 group. $P < 0.05, $$P < 0.01, and $$$P < 0.001vs. the PC group.'
