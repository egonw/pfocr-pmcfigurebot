caption: 'Significantly enriched amplification (red) and deletion (blue) events in
  the overall cohort of 17 samples, using GISTIC 2.0. Annotated cytobands indicate
  significant calls (FDR < 0.1) with the peaks corresponding to the significance value
  on the x-axis. The most significant regions included 2q11.2, 2q11.1 for gains and
  1p36.13, 7q22.1, 12q12, 2q11.1 for losses. The significantly amplified regions included
  several genes involved in fibroblast growth factor signaling, upstream of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathway: FGF3, FGF4, FGF9, FGF19, and FRS2.'
