caption: 'Lithocholic acid (LCA) did not drastically induce apoptosis or necroptosis.
  (A,B) IEC‐6 cell proliferation was tested by CCK‐8 assay under treatment with Z‐DEVD‐FMK
  (50 μM) or Z‐VAD‐FMK (50 μM), respectively for 1 h, following by LCA (80, 120 and
  160 μM) for 24 h. (C–E) IEC‐6 cells treated with different dose of LCA (60–180 μM)
  for 24, 12 or 6 h, and the level of pro‐caspase 3, cleaved‐caspase 3, PARP, cleaved‐PARP,
  RIPK1 and p‐RIPK 1 (Ser166) were detected by western blot. (F) IEC‐6 cell proliferation
  was tested by CCK‐8 assay under treatment with necrostatin‐1 (50 μM) for 1 h, following
  by LCA (80, 120 and 160 μM) for 24 h. (G) Apoptosis and necroptosis were assessed
  by annexin V‐FITC and PI double staining using flow cytometry, after cells were
  treated with 80, 120 and 160 μM LCA for 24 h, respectively. ##p <0.01 compared to
  LCA by Student''s t‐test; ns: not significant. Data provided are the mean ± SD from
  at least three independent experiments, and bar graphs represent the mean with error
  bars indicating SD'
