caption: Investigation of SEMA6D in chondrocytes with active catabolism or anabolism.
  (a–b) Chondrocytes were stimulated with different concentrations of FN-f, and the
  quantities of miR-7 and SEMA6D were measured by qRT-PCR. (c) The expression levels
  of MMP-2 and SEMA6D were estimated via western blotting after treating with different
  concentrations of FN-f. (d–e) Chondrocytes were stimulated with different concentrations
  of OP1, and the levels of miR-7 and SEMA6D were measured by qRT-PCR. (f) The expression
  levels of MMP-2 and SEMA6D were estimated via western blotting after treatment with
  different concentrations of OP1. ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗p < 0.05 compared with
  control group.
