caption: (a) Schematic representation showing oxidation-promoted transformation of
  healthy mucus to pathological mucus by the cross-linking of mucinâ€™s internal cysteine,
  via the formation of both end-to-end and side-to-side disulfide bonds. From [Sci.
  Transl. Med.2015, 7, 276ra27]. Reprinted with permission from AAAS. (b) Schematic
  representation showing the pathway of viral infection in the airways and the mucociliary
  defense mechanism. (c) Schematic showing ovulatory and nonovulatory mucus and their
  selective fertilization properties. (d) Schematic representation of the microbiota
  communities in healthy and diseased mucus. In healthy conditions microbiota move
  freely, whereas under disease conditions they attach to the epithelium cells. Reprinted

  (e) This cartoon illustrates a possible mechanism by which H. pylori crosses the
  mucus gel to infect the underlying cells.
