caption: GRWD1 is highly expressed in breast cancer cells. (A) The mRNA and (B) protein
  expression of GRWD1 in breast cancer cells and normal human breast epithelial cells
  was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blot analysis,
  respectively. ***P<0.001 vs. MCF-10A group. GRWD1, glutamate-rich WD-repeat-containing
  protein 1.

  of triple negative breast cancer through the Notch signaling pathway.
