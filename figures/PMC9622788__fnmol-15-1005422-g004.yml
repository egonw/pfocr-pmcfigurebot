caption: The relationships among all the regulatory necrosis involved in traumatic
  brain injury (TBI). The necroptosis can promote the apoptosis and inhibit the autophagy
  through the NF-ÎºB pathway. The PEBP1 can interact with RIP3 or 15LOX to initiate
  the necroptosis and the ferroptosis. The Tetrandrine can inhibit the ferroptosis
  through the inhibition of autophagy. Meanwhile, the autophagy can inhibit the pyroptosis
  through the JAK1/STAT1 pathway. As an inhibitor of the necroptosis, the Nec-1 can
  concurrently inhibit the BNIP3 and decrease the open efficiency of mPTP, thereby
  reducing the parthanatos. The Ghrelin also has anti-inflammatory properties, which
  can alleviate the pyroptosis, and furthermore alleviate the parthanatos by reducing
  the PARP-1.
