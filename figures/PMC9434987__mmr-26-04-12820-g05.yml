caption: 'FOXC1 overexpression counteracts the impacts of TRIM22 reduction on the
  proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion and inflammatory response of RA-FLSs.
  mRNA and protein expression levels of TRIM22 in RA-FLSs transfected with si-TRIM22
  and Ov-FOXC1 were detected via (A) RT-qPCR and (B) western blotting. (C) RA-FLS
  cell proliferation was detected using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. (D) Cell apoptosis
  was assessed using flow cytometry. (E) Western blotting was performed to analyze
  the protein expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins. The (F) migration and
  (G) invasion of RA-FLSs were assessed via Transwell assays. Magnification, ×200.
  (H) Western blotting was performed to analyze the protein expression levels of MMP2
  and MMP9. (I) Levels of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 were assessed using ELISA. (J) RT-qPCR
  determined the mRNA expression levels of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6. *P<0.05 and***P<0.001
