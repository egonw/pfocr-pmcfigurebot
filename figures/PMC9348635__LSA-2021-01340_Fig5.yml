caption: (A, B, C, D) Projection of organoids within each set after dimensionality
  reduction by principal component analysis, including the annotation of each organoidâ€™s
  size as dot size. The variance for each PC is indicated in the axis labels. (E)
  Heat map showing the expression values for marker genes after limma-voom normalisation,
  with a minimum count = 1. Rows are annotated by official gene symbols and colours
  indicating marker for proliferation (red), Wnt pathway (grey), epithelial (yellow)
  as well as progenitor and mature cell types for hepatic (orange, brown) and ductal
  (blue, violet). Data are clustered hierarchically by row and column and scaled by
  row. (F) Bar graph showing number of organoids for each cell cycle phase, coloured
  by set, after analysis with cyclone.
