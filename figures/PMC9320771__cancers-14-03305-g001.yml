caption: 'Interaction between estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor
  -2 (HER2) pathways. In ER+/HER2+ tumors, the hyperactivation of HER2 signaling activates
  downstream kinases and downregulates ER expression, not only at the protein level
  but also at mRNA expression. EGFR: epidermal growth factor receptor; HER3: human
  epidermal growth factor -3; HER4: human epidermal growth factor -4; P: phosphorylated;
  MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K: phosphoinositide-3-kinase; CoA: coactivator;
  G-protein: Guanine nucleotide binding protein; AKT: protein kinase B; SRC: steroid
  receptor coactivator. (Adapted from “HER2 Signaling Pathway”, by BioRender.com (2022).
