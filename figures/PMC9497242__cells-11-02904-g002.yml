caption: 'Microarray analysis of the gene expression pattern between T cell-enriched
  healthy and psoriatic skin substitutes. (a) Scatter plots of log2 of signal intensity
  from 60,000 different probes covering the entire human transcriptome of HS+T (x-axis)
  against PS+T (y-axis). The color scale corresponds to the level of gene expression
  (dark blue being the lowest and dark red the highest) (b) Heatmap representation
  of the expression profile for the 10 genes identified through the IPA analysis as
  the most strongly deregulated between healthy (n = 3) and psoriatic (n = 4) skin
  substitutes enriched with T cells. (c) Ingenuity pathway analysis of gene interaction
  networks altered in PS+T condition built around biological functions of interest:
  proliferation, differentiation, migration, apoptosis and cell division. HS+T, healthy
  skin substitutes with T cells; PS+T, psoriatic skin substitutes with T cells.'
