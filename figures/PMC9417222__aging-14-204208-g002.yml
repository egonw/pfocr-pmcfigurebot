caption: IL-17D overexpression does not affect the biological behavior of tumor cells
  in vitro, but promotes tumor progression in vivo. (A) Cell proliferation measurements
  (BrdU) compared between IL-17D–expressing and control cells (n = 5–6). (B) IL-17D–expressing
  cancer cells and control cells were subjected to invasion assay. Error bars represent
  the means ± standard deviation (SD) for a representative experiment performed in
  triplicate. Scale bars, 100 μm. (C) IL-17D–expressing A549 cells and control cells
  were subjected to a wound healing assay. Error bars represent the means ± SD for
  a representative experiment performed in triplicate. Scale bar, 100 μm. (D) Subcutaneous
  tumor growth of IL-17D–expressing and control LLC1 cells were measured (n = 5).
  Control and IL-17D–expressing LLC1 cell lines were harvested and injected into WT
  mice (100% tumor positive). Data are representative of three independent experiments.
  ***P < 0.001. (E) Images of subcutaneous tumors. Tumors were excised at day 15 after
  subcutaneous injection. (F) Subcutaneous tumor weight was measured and compared.
  **P < 0.01.
