figure_title: PRSS22 combined with ANXA1 regulates BC cells migration and invasion
  by ERK 1/2 signaling pathway
caption: A, B The expression of ANXA1 in triple-negative metastatic cell lines (MDA-MB-231,
  MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-453) and luminal cell lines (T47D and MCF-7) were performed
  by RT-qPCR (A) and Western blot (B). C, D Western blot analysis of the different
  signaling modules downstream of PRSS22 in BC cells expressing PRSS22-WT, PRSS22-R49A,
  PRSS22-C139A/D141E or control cells. E, F Western blot analysis of the different
  signaling modules downstream of PRSS22 in BC cells with or without PRSS22 knockdown.
  G, H The expression of PRSS22 and ANXA1 in concentrated conditioned medium of BC
  cells expressing PRSS22-WT, PRSS22-R49A, PRSS22-C139A/D141E or control were performed
  by Western blot. I, J Transwell assays confirmed that Ac2-26 induced a dose-dependent
  increase in migration and invasion (Scale bars, 100 μm). Data are shown as mean ± SD
  of three independent experiments, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
