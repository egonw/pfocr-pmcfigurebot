caption: Effects of ROS on the autophagy and cell activity of SW480 cells induced
  by PPI. (A,B) LC3 protein level was examined by Western blot assay after treatment
  with PPI and NAC for 12 and 24 h, respectively; (C,D) the quantification of the
  ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I. (E,F) Cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay after
  treatment with PPI and NAC for 12 and 24 h, respectively. n = 3, the data are presented
  as means Â± SEM. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01.
