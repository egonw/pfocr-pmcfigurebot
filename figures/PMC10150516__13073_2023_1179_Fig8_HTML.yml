caption: Cellular processes identified by GSEA of the three β-cell sub-clusters β1,
  β2, and β3 in the in vivo snRNA-seq compared with the in vitro dataset. Dotplot
  depicting the expression levels and percentage of cells expressing four representatives.
  A ECM-related C2 pathway genes (interaction, response, organization, and integrins),
  B vesicle-related C2 pathway genes (biogenesis, budding, transport, lysosome), C
  insulin-related C2 pathway genes (processing, secretion and glucose metabolism),
  and D proliferation/differentiation related C2 pathway genes (proliferation, development,
  differentiation, regulation of gene expression) in the in vivo snRNA-seq compared
  with the in vitro dataset
article_title: Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of human pancreatic islets identifies
  novel gene sets and distinguishes β-cell subpopulations with dynamic transcriptome
  profiles.
