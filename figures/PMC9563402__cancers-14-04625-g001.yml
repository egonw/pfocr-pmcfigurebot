caption: Different MAPKs associate with specific MAPK kinase (MAPKK) and MAPK kinase
  kinase (MAPKKK) to form a conserved three-stage enzymatic cascade (MAPKKK→MAPKK→MAPK),
  through which upstream signals are transmitted from MAPK to downstream nuclear transcription
  factors and cytoskeletal proteins to form a complete MAPK signaling pathway, which
  finally completes the regulation of cellular physiological activities.
