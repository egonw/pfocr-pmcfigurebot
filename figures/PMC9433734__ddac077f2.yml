caption: 'Inverse correlation of NMNAT3 and monomeric α-syn expression levels in caudate
  nucleus of Parkinson’s disease brain. (A) Western blot detection of α-syn in caudate
  nucleus RIPA lysates of Parkinson’s disease patients. α-syn was detected using anti-α-syn
  primary antibody and bands were visualized using electrochemiluminescence detection.
  Soluble oligomers of α-syn are identified by *. (B) Correlation between tubulin-normalized
  NMNAT3 and monomeric α-syn expressions was performed by the Spearman correlation
  coefficient analysis using Prism v.8.3. For all panels: 1–8 = Parkinson’s disease
  sample. Abbreviations: NMNAT3, nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 3;
  SYN, α-synuclein; kDa, kilodaltons; M, molecular weight markers; 1–8, sample lanes.'
article_title: Alpha-synucleinopathy reduces NMNAT3 protein levels and neurite formation
  that can be rescued by targeting the NAD+ pathway.
