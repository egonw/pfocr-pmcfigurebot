caption: Mechanisms that regulate SAPCD2 expression. SAPCD2 expression was found to
  be regulated via multiple pathways. One of well-characterized pathways involves
  coordinated interactions of transcription factors STAT5, E2H2 and β-catenin. In
  addition, ERK2, TNF-α and Wnt signaling pathway are found to promote SAPCD2 expression.
  However, the detailed mechanisms underlying these regulatory pathways need to be
  further defined. Two non-coding RNAs are demonstrated to regulate SAPCD2 expression
  at translational level, with miRNA miR-29a repressing its expression and lncRNA
  PXN-As1-L promoting its expression.
