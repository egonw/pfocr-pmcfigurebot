caption: Anlotinib (A) and PD-L1 inhibitor (P) inhibit the PI3K/AKT/Bcl-xl signal
  pathways, resulting in a significant efficacy in cancer apoptosis cells. (A,B) Expression
  of PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, and Bcl-xl in MDA-MB-468 or BT-549 cells was detected
  using Western blot assay. GADPH served as the loading control. (C,D) Quantitative
  analysis of the Western blotting results. Data represent the mean Â± SD of three
  independent experiments. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 compared with the control.
  (E) Schematic depiction of the underlying mechanism of anlotinib and PD-L1 inhibitor-promoting
  apoptosis in TNBC cells via the PI3K/AKT/Bcl-xl signaling pathway. PBS phosphate
  buffered saline; PD-L1, programmed cell death-ligand 1; GADPH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; TNBC, triple-negative breast cancer; SD, standard deviation.
