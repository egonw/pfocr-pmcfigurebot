caption: 'Cathelicidin (LL‐37) stimulates immune inflammatory responses in human coronary
  artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) cells by promoting the toll‐like receptors 4 (TLR4)‐NF‐κB
  signaling pathway. (A) The levels of interleukin (IL)‐6, IL‐1β, IL‐17A, and tumor
  necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α) in cells; (B) the levels of CXCL1, CXCL2, CCL5, and MCP‐1
  in cells; (C) the levels of ICAM‐1, VCAM‐1, ELAM‐1, and NLRP3 in cells; (D) the
  mRNA levels of LL‐37 and NLRP3 in cells; (E, F) the protein expression of NF‐κB
  p65 and TLR4 in cells was detected by Western blot analysis, those in western blot
  assays were expressed after being normalized to β‐actin. The data are expressed
  as the mean ± SD. Compared with the control group, *p < .05 **p < .01. Compared
  with the LL‐37 group, #p < .05 ##p < .01.'
