caption: Interactions between the degraded proteins identified from chicken M. pectoralis
  major and M. iliotibialis during the seven storage days. Cellular components (myofibril
  and cytosol), KEGG pathway (glycolysis / gluconeogenesis, metabolic pathway, and
  ECM-receptor interaction), molecular function (structural molecule activity and
  oxygen binding), and biological process (biosynthetic process) are indicated by
  various colors. Proteins are represented by gene names as depicted in .

  and iliotibialis muscles in relation to muscle fiber type distribution.
