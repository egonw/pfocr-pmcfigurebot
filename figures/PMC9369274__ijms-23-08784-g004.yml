caption: MACP2-weakened plant resistance depending on SA pathway to fungal pathogen.
  (A) Phenotypes of leaves from 4-week-old wild-type, MACP2-KO mutants, and MACP2-OEs
  plants in response to B. cinerea infection. Added B.c. on leaf surface and photographed
  3 days after treatment. (B) Relative lesion size of wild-type, MACP2-KOs, and MACP2-OEs
  leaves after 3 days of B. cinerea infection. The lesion size was calculated by ImageJ
  and relative lesion size was calculated by comparing the values from treated leaves
  versus mock leaves. Asterisks indicate significant differences from the wild-type.
  ** p < 0.01 by Student’s t test. (C) SA contents detection of wild-type, MACP2-KO
  mutants, and MACP2-OEs adult plants during B. cinerea infection. The contents of
  SA and SAG were measured by LC-MS. The “g” in “ng/g” represented the fresh weight.
  The experiments were biologically repeated three times with similar results. Error
  bars represent SD. n = 3 biological replicates. ** p < 0.01 by Student’s t test.
  (D) Phenotypes of leaves from 4-week-old wild-type, MACP2-OE, eds1-22, and MACP2-OE
  eds1-22 leaves in response to B. cinerea infection. (E) Relative lesion size of
  wild-type, MACP2-OE, eds1-22, and MACP2-OE eds1-22 leaves after 3 days of B. cinerea
  infection. Asterisks indicate significant differences from the wild-type. ** p <
  0.01 by Student’s t test.2.5. MACP2 Differentially Modulates Plant Sensitivities
  to Fungal and Bacterial Pathogens via the SA Signaling Pathway.
