caption: FAK and the tumor microenvironment are intricately linked. The increase in
  chemokines secreted by tumor cells through FAK-related pathways induces the accumulation
  of immunosuppressive cells and suppresses immune killer cells, allowing tumor cells
  to gradually escape from the immune system (); meanwhile, FAK activates the VEGF-C-secreted
  signaling pathway within the tumor tissue, leading to enhanced vascular regeneration
  and lymphatic vessel regeneration around the tumor. Endothelial cells (), fibroblasts
  (), and adipocytes () surrounding the tumor can also contribute to the shaping of
  the TME by activating FAK-related pathways.
