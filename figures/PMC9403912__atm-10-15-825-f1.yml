caption: 'The disease activity index and histologic scores changed in the rats with
  experimentally induced colitis. (A) Disease activity indexes of the different rat
  groups. (B) Histologic scores of the different rat groups. (C) HES-stained intestinal
  tissue from the different groups of rats. The distances between two parallel lines
  are mucosa thickness. Blank: normal untreated rats; TNBS: colitic rats; TNBS + FMT:
  colitic rats treated with fecal microbiota transplantation; TNBS + Ped: colitic
  rats treated with prednisone; TNBS + SB431542: colitic rats treated with the TGF-β1
  inhibitor SB431542. *, P<0.05 vs. the Blank group; #, P<0.05 vs. the TNBS group.
  HES, hematoxylin-eosin-saffron; TNBS, 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid.'
