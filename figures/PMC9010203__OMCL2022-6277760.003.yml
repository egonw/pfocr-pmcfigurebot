caption: 'Effect of GDN on p62/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. (a-c) Activation of Nrf2
  signaling by GDN in LPS-stimulated macrophages. (d-f) Activation of Nrf2 signaling
  by GDN in normal macrophages. (g-k) GDN activates p62/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling in MH7A
  cells in a time-dependent manner. (l-m) GDN caused Nrf2 activation in RASFs. Cells
  were seeded into 6 well plates and then treated with GDN for different time and
  different concentration. mRNA and protein were detected by Q-PCR and western blotting,
  respectively. Values of ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001 were declared statistically
  significant vs control group; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, and ###p < 0.001 were declared
  statistically significant vs LPS group.'
