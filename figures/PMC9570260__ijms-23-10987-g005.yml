caption: 'Effect of gallic acid on NFκB canonical signaling pathway. Human CD14+ monocytes
  were treated with gallic acid (GA) upon B. burgdorferi 31 stimulation. Levels of
  proteins were assessed by RT-qPCR (A) and Western blot (B) after 12 h post-treatment.
  Densitometry of Western blot bands (C). 1—control cells not stimulated with B. burgdorferi;
  2—control cells stimulated with B. burgdorferi at cells:bacteria 1:5 ratio; 3—cells
  stimulated with B. burgdorferi at cells:bacteria 1:5 and treated with gallic acid
  at 25 µg/mL; 4—cells stimulated with B. burgdorferi at cells:bacteria 1:5 and treated
  with gallic acid at 50 µg/mL; 5—cells stimulated with B. burgdorferi at cells:bacteria
  1:5 and treated with gallic acid at 75 µg/mL; # p ≤ 0.05, ∆ p ≤ 0.01, * p ≤ 0.001;
  control—DMSO only (0.035%).'
