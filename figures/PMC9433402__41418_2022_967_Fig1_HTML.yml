figure_title: STING is elevated in macular retina of dry AMD patients and cGAS-STING
  signaling is activated during mouse retina degeneration
caption: 'A Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) profiles showing significant enrichment
  of gene sets associated with indicated pathway in dry AMD retinas (n = 41) compared
  to normal retinas (n = 55) (GSE29801) []. The false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.25
  for pathways mentioned. B RNA-seq analysis of STING expression in extra-macular
  and macular retinas of normal (n = 26) and dry AMD patients (n = 20) []. Comparisons
  were made between retinas from normal and dry AMD patients (unpaired t-test), and
  the extra-macular and macular retinas of the same eye (paired t-test). C–J Mice
  were intraperitoneal (IP) injected with PBS or sodium iodate (SI) (35 mg/kg) and
  analysis was conducted 3-day post injection otherwise indicated. C Fundus photography
  (a, b) and fluorescein angiography (c, d) showing eye morphology. RPE flat mounts
  stained with phallodin-FITC to label the F-actin (e, f) and with IBA1 antibody to
  label the mononuclear phagocytes (MP) (g, h). Scale bar: 20 μM. (n = 3). (i, j)
  Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showing IBA1-positive MP in retina sections. Scale bar:
  50 μM (n = 2). D Upper panels: Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end
  labeling (TUNEL) analysis showing cell death. Arrow head: TUNEL-positive RPE cells.
  Lower panels: Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. (n = 3) H: hour, D: day. Scale
  bar: 50 μM. Western blot (WB) analysis showing retina proteins at the indicated
  time (E) or 3-day (F, G) post injection. Right panels: quantification results of
  WB. M month. H qRT-PCR analysis of retina RNA 3-day post injection. I WB showing
  retina proteins. Right panels: quantification results of WB. J IHC analysis using
  rhodopsin antibody shows retina structure 1-day post SI injection. Arrows indicated
  destruction of photoreceptors. (n = 3). Scale bar:100 μM.'
