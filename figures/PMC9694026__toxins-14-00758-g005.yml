caption: 'Effects of zearalenone (ZEA) on protein levels of ESCs. WB images of: (A).
  Levels of ERS related proteins in cells; (B). Levels of JNK and p-JNK protein in
  cells; (C). Levels of apoptosis-related protein in cells; (D). Levels of p-JNK in
  the nucleus. Histograms created from the WB data: (E). Levels of ASK1 in each group
  of cells; (F). Levels of GRP78 in each group of cells; (G). Levels of CHOP in each
  group of cells; (H). Levels of PERK in each group of cells; (I). The p-JNK/JNK ratio
  in each group of cells; (J). The intracellular Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in each group of
  cells; (K). Levels of Caspase 3 in each group of cells; (L). Levels of Caspase 9
  in each group of cells; (M). Levels of p-JNK in the nucleus in each group of cells.
  CON, control; ZEA, cells treated with 15 μM ZEA; P + Z, cells treated with ZEA and
  4-Phenylbutyrate (4-PBA). Treatment time: 24 h. “*” Represents a significant difference
  compared with the control group, “**” represents a highly significant difference
  compared with the control group, “#” indicates a significant difference compared
  with the ZEA group, “##” indicates a highly significant difference compared with
  the ZEA group.'
