caption: Effects of different concentrations of BOHB and acetoacetate on endocytosis
  and megalin expression of HK-2 cells. (a) Quantification of FITC-BSA uptake in HK2
  cells in different concentrations of BOHB. (b) Quantification of FITC-BSA uptake
  in HK2 cells in the indicated pH level. pH 7.1 represents 0 mmol/l BOHB; pH 7.0
  represents 0.5 mmol/l BOHB; pH 6.8 represents 1 mmol/l BOHB; pH 6.7 represents 2
  mmol/l BOHB; pH 6.6 represents 3 mmol/l BOHB; pH 6.5 represents 4 mmol/l BOHB. (c)
  Quantification of FITC-BSA uptake in HK2 cells in different concentrations of BOHB
  when pH was adjusted to 7.4. (d) Representative western blotting images and quantification
  of megalin in different concentrations of BOHB. (E) Representative western blotting
  images and quantification of megalin in different concentrations of AcAc. AcAc,
  acetoacetate; BOHB, beta-hydroxybutyric acid. Data are expressed as mean ± SD. ∗∗Represents
  P < 0.01; ∗represents P < 0.05.
