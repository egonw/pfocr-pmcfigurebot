caption: 'Knockdown of AK018453 decreases the activation of TRAP1/Smad pathway and
  the production of inflammation cytokines in IL‐17‐activated astrocytes. Primary
  mouse astrocytes were infected with recombinant lentivirus carrying GFAP promoter
  and AK‐shRNA or ctrl‐shRNA, for 72 h, respectively, followed by IL‐17 (50 ng/ml)
  treatment for 6 h. (a) Western blot assay was arranged to detect the protein level
  of TRAP1, Smad4, p‐Smad2/3, and Smad2/3. (b) Co‐immunoprecipitation (co‐IP) assay
  was employed to measure the interaction of TRAP1 with Smad4. (c) The mRNA levels
  of TNF‐α, CXCL10, and MCP‐1 in astrocytes were tested by real‐time PCR assay. (d)
  The secretion levels of TNF‐α, CXCL10, and MCP‐1 in the supernatant of astrocytes
  were measured by ELISA. The data are from three independent experiments and represented
  as mean ± SEM. *p < .05 and ***p < .001 versus no IL‐17 group; #p < .05 and ##p < .01
  versus ctrl‐shRNA + IL‐17 group (n = 3)'
