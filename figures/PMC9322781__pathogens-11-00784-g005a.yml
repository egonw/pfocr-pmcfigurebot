caption: (A) The top 20 up-regulated genes in IUA endometria vs. non-IUA control.
  (IUA, n = 6; control, n = 6; Fold change > 3, t-test p < 0.01). (B) The top 20 down-regulated
  genes in IUA endometria vs. non-IUA control. (IUA, n = 6; control, n = 6; Fold change
  < âˆ’3 and t-test p < 0.01). (C,D) The up-regulated (C) and down-regulated (D) KEGG
  pathways in IUA endometria vs. non-IUA control. Only the top 20 annotations are
  shown. The most up-regulated genes in IUA endometria compared to the non-IUA control
  are involved in the Cytokineâ€“cytokine receptor interaction, Chemokine signaling
  pathway, Staphylococcus aureus infection, Hematopoietic cell lineage, Natural killer
  cell mediated cytotoxicity, Complement and coagulation cascades, B cell receptor
  signaling pathway, Th17 cell differentiation, and T cell receptor signaling pathway,
  while the most down-regulated genes are involved in the Ribosome.
