caption: Interactions of miRNAs in signaling pathways and cellular processes. The
  blue circles indicate genes that are being modulated by miRNAs. The full arrows
  indicate production or direct activation of a particular process, while the dotted
  arrows show that the pathway is activated, but different processes occur prior to
  its termination. Likewise, the small blue circles in the middle of the arrows indicate
  direct action on the track. Moreover, the line terminated by another line perpendicularly
  means inhibition. This graphic was made based on the KEGG database.
