caption: 'O-GlcNAc signaling pathway. Step 1: the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway
  incorporates metabolites from protein, carbohydrate, lipid, energy, and nucleotide
  metabolism to synthesize UDP-GlcNAc, which fluctuates with cellular nutrient status.
  Step 2: OGT transfers UDP-GlcNAc to any of its thousands of target proteins and
  OGA removes the O-GlcNAc moiety, known as O-GlcNAcylation, to modulate protein function.
  O-GlcNAcylation occurs in a similar manner to phosphorylation and may be as widespread,
  but O-GlcNAcylation patterns correlate to cellular nutrient status and is only mediated
  through the enzymes OGT and OGA. In skeletal muscle, glycolytic muscle has a greater
  abundance of O-GlcNAcylated proteins. In fact, several glycolytic enzymes and mitochondrial
  proteins are targets of OGT, and as such O-GlcNAcylation can modulate skeletal muscle
  metabolism in response to changing dietary conditions. Created with BioRender.com.'
