caption: 'Metabolome view map of the differential metabolites (variable importance
  projection > 1, p < 0.05) identified in the feces of sows fed different acid detergent
  fiber levels ((a): 4.3% vs. 6.5%; (b): 5.4% vs. 6.5%) during late gestation. The
  x-axis represents the pathway impact and the y-axis represents the pathway enrichment.
  The node color is based on its p-value, and the node radius is determined based
  on the pathway impact values. Larger sizes and darker colors represent higher pathway
  enrichment and impact values, respectively.'
