caption: BST2 regulated proliferation and apoptosis of EESCs via the NF-κB signaling
  pathway. (A–C), CCK-8 assay (A) and EdU staining assay (B, C) were conducted to
  measure the cell proliferation ability of EESCs after transfection with Si-BST2
  and/or IL-1β. (D, F) The western blot analysis was used to examine the proliferation-related
  protein (D) and apoptosis-related protein (F) after transfection with Si-BST2 and/or
  IL-1β. (E), The Flow cytometry was performed to detect the apoptosis rates of the
  EESCs transfected with Si-BST2 and/or IL-1β. *p < 0.05; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001.
