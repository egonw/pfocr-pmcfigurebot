caption: 'The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is involved in endothelin-1 or ET-1–mediated
  NFκB activity IL-6 and TNF-α expression. (A–E) C2C12 and G7 cells were pretreated
  with BQ123, BQ788, Ly294002, or Akt inhibitor followed, by stimulation with ET-1,
  and were analyzed using immunofluorescence assay. (F) C2C12 and G7cells were incubated
  for 24 h with various concentrations of ET-1, and in vitro NFκB-luciferase activity
  was measured. (G) C2C12 and G7cells were pretreated with BQ123, BQ788, Ly294002,
  or Akt inhibitor for 30 min stimulated for 24 h with ET-1 (50 nM), and in vitro
  NFκB–luciferase activity was measured. Results are expressed of four independent
  experiments performed in triplicate. *p < 0.05 compared with control; #p < 0.05
  compared with the ET-1–treated group.'
