caption: Analysis and definition of biological and immunological characteristics for
  IS1. (A) Differential enrichment analysis of signaling pathways in IS1 compared
  with IS2 and IS3 in TCGA cohorts. (B) Differential enrichment analysis of EMT and
  Myc signaling pathways among the ccRCC immune subtypes in TCGA cohorts. (C) Heatmap
  showing the distribution of key regulators of the EMT signaling pathway among the
  three immune subtypes. (Dâ€“H) Differential expression of molecules in the EMT signaling
  pathway among the three immune subtypes in TCGA cohorts.
