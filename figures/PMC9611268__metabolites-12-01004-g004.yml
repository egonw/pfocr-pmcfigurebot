caption: IIM-related metabolite alterations and pathways in muscle tissue. (A) Individual
  scatter plots of significant metabolites related to important pathways in mouse
  tissue. (B) Overview of altered metabolites related to the skeletal muscle tissue
  of mice. Red-colored metabolite indicates up-regulation in CIM mice, while blue-colored
  metabolites represent down-regulation as compared with the control mice. (C) Protein
  expression and (D) relative quantitative data of ODC-1, SMOX, and tubulin. (* p
