caption: AMD1 promotes spermidine production and breast cancer cell proliferation.
  (A) Polyamine biosynthetic pathway. (A) Spermidine level was analyzed in normal
  breast tissue, luminal and BLBC tumors from Teunuma’s metabolomics dataset. (C,
  D) Stable clones with empty vector or AMD1 expression were also generated in BT549
  and Hs578T cells (C), and stable transfectants with empty vector or knockdown of
  AMD1 expression were established in MDA-MB468 and SUM159 cells (D). (E, F) Level
  of spermidine was measured in BT549 and Hs578T cells with stable empty vector or
  ADM1 expression (E) as well as MB468 and SUM159 cells with stable empty vector or
  knockdown of AMD1 expression(F). (G, H) Growth of BT549 and Hs578T cells with stable
  empty vector or ADM1 expression (G) as well as MB468 and SUM159 cells with stable
  empty vector or knockdown of AMD1 expression (H) was measured by cell-count assay
  for 2 days. Data are shown as a percentage of control cells (mean ± SD in two independent
  experiments). *p < 0.01 by Student’s t-test
