caption: Antitumor effects of Salmonella on mice bearing ATC. BALB/c nude mice were
  inoculated subcutaneously ASH-3 (107) at day 0 and intraperitoneal injected Salmonella
  (2×106 cfu) or PBS at day 7. (A) The body weight (mean ± SD, n = 10) were compared
  with PBS group. (B) Tumor volumes (mean ± SD, n = 10) in mice bearing ASH-3 tumors
  were compared with PBS group. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01. (C) Kaplan-Meier survival curves
  of ASH-3 bearing mice with Salmonella or PBS are shown (p < 0.01 for mice bearing
  ASH-3 treated with Salmonella versus PBS).
