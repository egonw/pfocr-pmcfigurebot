caption: Pathway analysis of metabolites in fermentation of ZC. A is the metabolic
  pathway of flavor substances and organic acids, B is the abundance change of PICRUSt2
  prediction analysis of microbial key function enzymes. (The abundance change of
  enzymes in a corresponds to the color change in B, where the darker the red color
  represents the higher the abundance, and the darker the blue color represents the
  lower the abundance.). (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure
  legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
