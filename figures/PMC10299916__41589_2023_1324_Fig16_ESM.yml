figure_title: Model of Bcs3 in the context of the ABC-transporter dependent capsule
  assembly system of Hib
caption: a, (1, 2) Capsule expression in ABC-transporter dependent assembly systems
  starts with the synthesis of a poly-Kdo linker attached to a (lyso)phosphatidylglycerol.
  This precursor is conserved in all Gram-negative bacteria utilizing the ABC-transporter
  dependent pathway and its assembly is catalyzed in E. coli by the Î²-Kdo transferases
  KpsS and KpsC. KpsS transfers a single Kdo, which is then extended by KpsC. By homology,
  HcsB and HcsA were suggested to catalyze this reaction in Hib. (3) One or several
  yet to be identified transition transferases were hypothesized to add the first
  repeating unit to the poly-Kdo, in order to create an acceptor for the (4) capsule
  polymerase, which assembles the capsule polymer and determines the serotype. The
  electrostatic surface potential of Bcs3 and its concave surface suggest an orientation
  in which the active centers of the enzyme face the inner membrane and/or the (5)
  ABC transporter-dependent export complex (BexA-D). The distance between the two
  SH3b binding domains might allow an enzymatic assembly in which each of the two
  chains generated by the Bcs3 dimer is exported by one ABC transporter complex. It
  is of note that interactions between the components of the Hib assembly system have
  not been experimentally proven. However, studies in E. coli present evidence for
  the formation of a multi-protein complex,. Moreover, ATP-dependent translocation
  coupled with Bcs3 synthesis and channeling of two polymer threads by the SH3b domain
  through two transporters is hypothesized as an efficient scenario for capsule expression.
  To allow a concise presentation, enzymes providing nucleotide substrates (for example
  CMP-Kdo, CDP-ribitol) are not shown. b, Reaction cycle of Bcs3 for the addition
  of one repeating unit to the non-reducing end of the nascent Hib capsule polymer.
