figure_title: Differentially expressed genes in small intestine from young (8–14 weeks)
  Rbm47-IKO mice
caption: (A) Heatmap illustration of top upregulated and downregulated genes in Rbm47-IKO
  versus Rbm47fl/fl mice. (B) STRING analysis of upregulated genes related to oxidative
  response (left) and WNT signaling (right). (C) Enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
  and Genomes (KEGG) pathways in upregulated (top) and downregulated (bottom) genes.
  (D) qPCR evaluation of differentially upregulated genes involved in antioxidative
  response and glutathione metabolism (mean ± SEM, unpaired t test, n = 4 fl/fl and
  6 IKO); *P < 0.05. (E) Relative Fndc5 mRNA abundance at successive time points after
  actinomycin D treatment as a fraction of baseline Fndc5 in enteroids (top) and colonoids
  (bottom) (mean ± SEM, unpaired t test, n = 3 independent experiments per genotype/time
  point); *P < 0.05. (F) Abundance of RBM47, ACTIN, and FNDC5 proteins in middle small
  intestine mucosa from Rbm47fl/fl and Rbm47-IKO mice (each lane represents a pool
  of 3 separate extracts per genotype). (G) Tissue content of total (left) and reduced
  (right) glutathione in middle small intestine from young mice (mean ± SEM, unpaired
  t test, n = 8 fl/fl and 6 IKO). ***P < 0.001. (H–K) qPCR evaluation of differentially
  upregulated genes involved in WNT signaling and cell proliferation (H), stem cell
  markers and developmental genes (I), genes involved in ERBB2/MAPK pathway (J), and
  IL-33–related genes (K) (mean ± SEM, unpaired t test, n = 4 fl/fl and 6 IKO); *P
  < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
