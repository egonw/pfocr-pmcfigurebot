figure_title: Key neuronal signalling pathways are downregulated in fast growing in
  vivo juvenile liver fluke
caption: 'Components of classical neurotransmission are downregulated in in vivo maintained
  juvenile liver fluke (A). Differential expression of nervous system components of
  the synaptic vesicle cycle, cholinergic signalling and glutamatergic signalling.
  Fasciola hepatica homologues of human components enclosed in rectangular boxes.
  Green = downregulated in vivo, red = upregulated in vivo, grey = not differentially
  expressed, X = not present in F. hepatica genome (PRJEB25283). Abbreviations: SYT,
  synaptotagmin; VAMP, vesicle associated membrane protein; Rab3a, ras-related protein;
  RIM, regulating synaptic membrane exocytosis protein; MUNC(-13, -18), syntaxin binding
  protein; SNAP25, synaptosome associated protein; VGCC, voltage-gated calcium channel;
  NSF, N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor; Î±SNAP, NSF associated protein; AP2, adaptor
  related protein complex 2; ChAT, choline O-acetyltransferase; AChE, acetylcholinesterase;
  vAChT, vesicular acetylcholine transporter; CHT, high affinity choline transporter;
  Gi/o, guanine nucleotide-binding protein; mAChR, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor;
  nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; GLNT, amino acid transporter; GLS, glutaminase;
  vGLUT, vesicular glutamate transporter; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase;
  AC, adenylate cyclase 1; PKA, protein kinase A; EAAT, glial high affinity glutamate
  transporter; mGluR, muscarinic glutamate receptor; GluCl, glutamate-gated chloride
  channel; KA, kainate type ionotropic glutamate receptor; NMDA, NMDA type ionotropic
  glutamate receptor; DELTA, delta type ionotropic glutamate receptor. Components
  of neuropeptidergic signalling pathway are downregulated in in vivo juvenile liver
  fluke (B). Heatmap showing differentially expressed genes associated with neuropeptidergic
  signalling in Fasciola hepatica.'
