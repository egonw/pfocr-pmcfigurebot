figure_title: ARHGEF2 exerted an angiogenic effect via EDN1
caption: A–D The cell-conditioned media of HepG2/siNC and HepG2/siEDN1 cells were
  collected for the tube formation assay (A), the CAM assay (B), the wound-healing
  (C) and the transwell assay (D). E–H EDN1 was knocked down in ARHGEF2 stable-overexpressing
  cell lines, and the CM was collected for the tube formation assay (E), the CAM assay
  (F), the wound-healing assay (G) and the transwell assay (H). I Schematic illustration
  of ER stress upregulates ZNF263/ARHGEF2/EDN1 signaling pathway to promotes angiogenesis
  and antagonizes the sensitivity of lenvatinib to HCC cells.
article_title: ARHGEF2/EDN1 pathway participates in ER stress-related drug resistance
  of hepatocellular carcinoma by promoting angiogenesis and malignant proliferation.
