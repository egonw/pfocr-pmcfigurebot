figure_title: Effect of L-Glutamine (L-Gln) on chondrocytes viability
caption: '(A) Molecular structure of L-Gln. (B,C) Chondrocytes were cultured with
  different concentrations of L-Gln (0, 5, 10, 20 mM) for 24 and 48 h. (D) Chondrocytes
  were pretreated with IL-1β, and cell viability was determined. #P<0. 05 versus the
  Control. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 versus the IL-1β group; n=3.'
