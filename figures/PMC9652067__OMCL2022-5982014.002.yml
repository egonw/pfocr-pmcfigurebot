caption: A total of 139 upregulated genes and 420 downregulated genes were identified
  in RNA-seq (a). GO enrichment analysis based on biological processes (BPs), molecular
  functions (MFs), and cellular components (CCs) was performed to gain insights into
  the physical part (b). Furthermore, KEGG pathway analysis was performed to identify
  the top 20 signaling pathways affected by differentially expressed genes (c). KEGG
  pathway annotation indicated that multiple genes were enriched in signal transduction
  and signaling molecules and interactions, confirming the KEGG enrichment findings
  (d). A PPI network of coregulated downregulated genes was obtained and visualized
  (e).
