caption: Effect of TCS on the expression of necroptosis associated marker genes in
  Neuro-2a cells. The cells were treated with DMSO (control), and TCS (10, 30 and
  50 µM) for 24 h. (a) Representative gel image displaying the formation of DNA ladder
  or smear in response to TCS. (b) Bar graph illustrating RT-qPCR analysis for the
  relative quantification of mRNA expression for indicated genes. (c) Representative
  expression pattern of necroptosis associated proteins as determined by immunoblot
  analysis. β-Actin was used as internal control in all analyses. The bar graphs in
  (b) and (c) represents fold change in expressions as compared to control cells for
  respective genes(b) or proteins (c). Results are representative of three independent
  experiments with mean ± SEM. * indicates p < 0.05 as compared to control cells in
  respective genes (b) or proteins (c). TCS, triclosan.
