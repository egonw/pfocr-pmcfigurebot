caption: 'FA inhibits VSMC migration by inhibiting microfilament aggregation. FA can
  significantly reduce the number of cell migration, and the difference is statistically
  significant. After FA intervention, the amount of microfilament aggregation decreased
  in a dose-dependent manner. The main statistical method used was Mann-Whitney U
  test after one-way ANOVA. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 ***p < 0.001 vs. untreated cell
  group, #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001 vs. PDGF groups'
