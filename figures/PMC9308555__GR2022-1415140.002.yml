caption: Enrichment analysis of mRNA integrated data set through gene set enrichment
  analysis (GSEA). GSEA results showing physiological cardiac muscle hypertrophy (a),
  collagen binding (b), activation of innate immune response (c), chemokine signaling
  pathway (d), renin angiotensin system (e), and T cell receptor signaling pathway
  (f) are differentially enriched in atrial fibrillation.
