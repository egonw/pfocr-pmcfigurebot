caption: The occurrence of FN-fragments in the plasma of patients with a viral infection
  (COVID-19, left panel) or a bacterial infection (sepsis, right panel). Representative
  immuno-patterns of FN and FN-fragments and the corresponding densitograms for Non-survivors
  (graphs (A,D)) and for Survivors (graphs (B,E). Correspondingly, graphs (C,F) compare
  the number of FN fragments, expressed as a percentage of all FN forms detected in
  the electrophoretic pathway between Non-survivors and Survivors. The box plots represent
  the median values (midpoint) with interquartile range between the 25th and 75th
  percentiles (box); the whiskers represent the minimum and maximum values. * indicates
  p-value less than 0.05.
