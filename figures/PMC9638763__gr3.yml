caption: (A) Protein-protein interaction network. The pink color indicates the 16
  intersecting genes, the blue color indicates the other genes in the PPI network
  where the 16 intersecting genes are located, the green color indicates the gene
  in the sub-network 1 extracted after Degree >18, and the yellow color indicates
  the gene in the sub-network 2. The top 20 BP (B) and MF (C) of the 16 intersecting
  genes enriched. The top 20 BP(F), MF(G), and CC(H) of GQD. The horizontal axis of
  the bars represents the percentage of intersecting genes in that term; the darker
  the color, the smaller the false discovery rate (FDR). The values on the bars indicate
  the number of genes on that pathway and the FDR value. Bubble plot for the top 10
  signaling pathways of the 16 intersecting genes (D) and GQD (I). The larger the
  bubble, the more the number of genes enriched on that pathway; the darker the color,
  the smaller the FDR(E) A network diagram of the intersecting genes and their pathways.
  The larger the icon, the more enriched the genes and their pathways.
