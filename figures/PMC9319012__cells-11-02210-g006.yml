caption: OGG1 regulates the expression of core genes in the HBP. (A) Scrambled (Scr)
  or OGG1-targeting siRNA was transfected into hSAECs. Cells were mock- or RSV-infected
  (MOI = 1, for 24 h), and Q-RT-PCR was performed for GFPT2 expression. Data are presented
  as fold change untreated controls normalized to PPIA. (B) hSAECs were mock- or RSV-infected
  in the absence (DMSO) or presence of TH5487. Shown are the fold change of GFPT2
  mRNA. (C) A549 epithelial carcinoma cells were treated as in (B). (D) Wild-type
  or OGG1−/− cells (by CrispR/Cas9) were mock-or RSV-infected. Shown is the fold change
  in GFPT2 mRNA expression. (E) GNPNAT1 mRNA expression in RSV-infected cells treated
  with solvent (DMSO) or TH5487. (F) UAP1 mRNA levels in cells treated as in panel
  (E). *, p <0.05; **, p < 0.01 post-hoc Tukey’s test.
