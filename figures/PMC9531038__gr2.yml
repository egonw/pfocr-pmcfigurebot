caption: Effect of MT on the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. (a) Expression of the
  PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway-related proteins, p-PI3K, p-Akt, p-mTOR proteins, and corresponding
  native proteins in the control, model, 3-MA, RAPA, and MT groups were detected by
  immunoblotting. (bâ€’d) Expression of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway-related proteins,
  p-PI3K, p-Akt, p-mTOR proteins, and the corresponding native proteins were detected
  by ImageJ software (three experiments were independently performed).
