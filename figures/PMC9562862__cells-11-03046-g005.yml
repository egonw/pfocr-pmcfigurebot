caption: E2F1 regulates miRNA-206 and miRNA-210 expression. (A–C). E2F1 ChIP-seq results
  in multiple non-cancerous and cancer cells mined from publicly available databases
  (see Methods for detail). Depicted are genomic regions in the vicinity of CDK1–a
  classical E2F1 target gene (A), miRNA-210 (B), and miRNA-206 (C). (D) HEK-293 cells
  were grown to 80% confluence in 6 well plates and subjected to E2F1 knockdown using
  either non-coding siRNA (si_NS) or anti-E2F1 siRNA (si_E2F1), incubated for 48h,
  then snap-frozen and processed for miRNA purification. Expression levels of miRNA-206
  and miRNA-210-5p were measured using qRT-PCR. Presented are results of four experiments,
  each with two biological replicates and two technical replicates. (E). Cells were
  transfected with plasmids encoding either “empty” pCMV plasmid or a pCMV-hE2F1 plasmid,
  incubated for 48h, then snap-frozen and processed for miRNA isolation. Expression
  levels of miRNA-206 and miRNA-210-5p were measured using qRT-PCR. Presented are
  results of three experiments, each with two biological replicates and two technical
  replicates. Results are mean ± SEM. ** = Pv ≤ 0.01. Comparison of means was done
  using Mann-Whitney non-parametric test. Effective E2F1 knock-down/over-expression
  using the exact siRNA/plasmid transfection protocol was demonstrated elsewhere (1).
