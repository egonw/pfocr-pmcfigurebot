caption: 'Canonical transient receptor potential channel 1 (TRPC1) regulates oxoglutaratedehydrogenase-like
  (Ogdhl) via Ca2+/calcineurin (CaN)/nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling pathway.
  (A, B) Representative Western blot images and relative quantification of p-NF-κB
  p65/NFκB p65 (p65) (A) and p-IκB-α/IκB-α (B) in wild-type (WT) and Trpc1−/− adult
  mouse ventricular myocytes upon hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) (5 h/1 h) condition
  (n = 4 per group). (C) The messenger RNA (mRNA) of Ogdhl in the HL-1 cells transfected
  with control (Con) or NF-κB small interfering RNA (siRNA) upon H/R (6 h/9 h) (n = 3
  per group). (D) Representative Western blot images and relative quantification of
  OGDHL in the HL-1 cells transfected with control or NF-κB siRNA, and then underwent
  H/R (6 h/9 h) (n = 4 per group). (E) The mRNA of Ogdhl after transfected with the
  NF-κB expression or control plasmid (n = 3 per group). (F) HEK-293 cells were transfected
  with NF-κB expression plasmid and Ogdhl promotor luciferase reporter constructs.
  Luciferase activity was detected 36 h after transfection using a betascope analyzer
  (n = 3 per group). (G) The association of NF-κB with the Ogdhl promoter was analyzed
  by a quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay (n = 6 per group).
  Representative Western blot images and relative quantification of (H) p-NF-κB p65/NF-κB
  p65 and (I) p-IκB-α/IκB-α in the HL-1 cells transfected with vector or Trpc1 and
  then treated with vehicle or SKF96365 (n = 4 per group). (J) Representative Western
  blot images and relative quantification of CaNα and CaNβ in the HL-1 cells transfected
  with vector or Trpc1 and then treated with a vehicle or SKF96365 (SKF) (n = 5 per
  group). ∗∗P < 0.01. NFAT: nuclear factor of activated T cells.'
