caption: 'Effects of programmed cell death ligand inhibition on the expression of
  interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor β 1. A: Western blot showing interleukin
  (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) 1 protein expression; B-E: Statistical
  maps of the differences in IL-10 protein expression (B), TGF-β1 protein expression
  (C), IL-10 mRNA expression (D), and TGF-β1 expression (E). Data are presented as
  mean ± SD, and the comparisons among each group were analyzed by one-way analysis
  of variance. Statistical significance was set as P < 0.05. PD-1: Programmed cell
  death 1; PD-L1: Programmed cell death ligand; DSS: Dextran sulfate sodium; B. infantis:
  Bifidobacterium infantis; IL: Interleukin; TGF-β: Transforming growth factor β;
  GAPDH: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; mRNA: Messenger ribonucleic acid.'

  and immune response in mice with inflammatory bowel disease.
