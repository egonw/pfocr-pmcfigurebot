figure_title: Differential gene expression analysis identifies distinct and conserved
  DDIR biology across BC and CRC
caption: A) Venn diagram of differentially expressed genes between DDIR positive and
  DDIR negative in three cohorts shows nine common genes, including chemokines such
  as CCL5 and CXCL10. B). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to identify potential
  elevated/activated upstream regulators of the conserved 9 genes identified in (A).
  C) Correlation and distribution of DDIR compared to a sum cumulative score generated
  from the 9 gene overlap in (A). D) 15-month PFS (top) and 12-week objective response
  rate (bottom) comparing the Almac DDIR score and the modified 9-gene score. Estimates
  adjusted for WHO PS, left vs right-sided, liver resection, number of mets, source
  and age of sample, CMS, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, TP53, MSI, imputed (N=361). E) Diagram
  displaying DDIR-positive and DDIR-negative specific tumour microenvironment and
  upregulation of biological features such as CXCL10 expression in CRC. DDIR-positive
  CRCs are riddled with immune infiltrates responding to inflammatory/interferon signalling
  leading to ‘inflamed’ TME. On the contrary, DDIR-negative CRCs are immune ‘cold’
  with low level of CXCL10, interferon signalling and overall low immune cells.
