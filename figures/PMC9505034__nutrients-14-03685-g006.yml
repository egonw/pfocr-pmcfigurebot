caption: 'Effects of EEIP on adipocyte size and the levels of adipogenic−related proteins
  in the subcutaneous fat tissue of HFD−fed obese mice. (A) H&E-stained images of
  subcutaneous adipose tissues. (B) The adipocyte diameter was measured through microscopic
  analysis. (C,D) Adipogenic−related protein expression was determined by Western
  blotting analysis and β−actin was used as the internal control. Densitometric analysis
  was performed using Bio−Rad Quantity One Software (BioRad; Hercules, CA, USA). Values
  are represented as the mean ± SEM. # p < 0.05 vs. normal diet control group; **
  p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001 vs. HFD group.'
