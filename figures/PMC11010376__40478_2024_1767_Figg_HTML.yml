caption: Effect of LXB4treatment on astrocyte reactivity markers in the mouse retina.
  LXB4 methyl ester treatment (n = 8, 5 ng/g IP; 0.5 ng/g topical) was started after
  one week of silicone oil injection every other day until the 4th week. Treatment
  with LXB4 modulates astrocyte reactivity genes in the ocular hypertension model,
  n = 4 (2 retinas were pooled for each replicate). (Ctrl- Control; OHT- ocular hypertension).
