caption: Analysis of anti-tumor drug effects on the mTOR signaling pathway. Western
  blot results show the HIN1, mTOR, phosphorylation of mTOR (p-mTOR), Rictor, phosphorylation
  of Rictor (p-Rictor), AKT, phosphorylation of AKT (p-AKT) (Thr308), p-AKT (Ser473),
  and GAPDH in ES2 cells, ES2 tumorspheres (TS), ES2TR160 cells, and ES2TR160 TS treated
  with 5-aza-dC, RAD001, or 5-aza-dC combined with RAD001. The numbers in the immunoblot
  represent the relative folds of HIN-1, p-mTOR, p-Rictor, p-AKT (Thr308), and p-AKT
  (Ser473) in ES2 cells, ES2 tumorspheres (TS), ES2TR160 cells, and ES2TR160 TS treated
  with 5-aza-dC, RAD001, or 5-aza-dC combined with RAD001 compared to the control
  group in ES2 cells without treatment. The numbers in the immunoblot were calculated
  as target protein density/target protein+GAPDH density and set the control group
  in ES2 cells without treatment as 1.
