caption: 'Thyroid hormone (T4)-induced PD-L1 controls β-catenin expression in human
  oral cancer cells. OEC-M1 cells were seeded in six-well trays and transfected with
  PD-L1 shRNA or a scrambled plasmid (0.5 μg/well) were treated with 10−7 M T4 for
  24 h. Cells were harvested, and RNA was extracted. A qPCR was conducted for proliferation-related
  genes. Data are presented as the mean ± SD. Results are from three independent studies
  (n = 4) ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, compared to the control; ## p < 0.01, ### p
  < 0.001, compared to T4, and $ p < 0.05, $$ p < 0.01, $$$ p < 0.001, compared to
  PD-L1 shRNA group.'
