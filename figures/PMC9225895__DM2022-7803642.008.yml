caption: GSEA enrichment plots showed that eleven gene sets related to tumor signaling
  pathways (calcium signaling pathway (a), cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) (b), wnt
  signaling pathway (c), ecm receptor interaction (d), leukocyte transendothelial
  migration (e), gap junction (f), regulation of actin cytoskeleton (g), MAPK signaling
  pathway (h), melanoma (i), pathways in cancer (j), JAK-STAT signaling pathway (k),
  and toll-like receptor signaling pathway (l)) were enriched in the high GNB4 expression
  group.
