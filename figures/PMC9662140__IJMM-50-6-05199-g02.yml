caption: Expression and function of the proteins identified by TMT-labeled quantitative
  proteomic in DPSC-Exos. (A) The number of differentially expressed proteins in DPSC-Exos
  compared with DPSCs was identified using TMT-labeled quantitative proteomics analysis.
  (B) Volcano map of differentially expressed proteins. (C) Differentially expressed
  proteins were categorized according to the biological process (Gene Ontology term)
  they were involved in; several of these were related to wound healing. (D) Kyoto
  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis of DPSC-Exos revealed that the
  enriched proteins involved in multiple signal transductions, including the MAPK
  signaling pathway. (E and F) The expression of Cdc42, p38 and p-p38 in HUVECs was
  higher following treatment with DPSC-Exos (n=3). *P<0.05. (G) Western blot analysis
  of pro-angiogenic protein (FGD5) and cytosolic marker (Î²-actin) expression from
  DPSC and DPSC-Exos. TMT, tandem mass tags; DPSC, dental pulp stem cell; Exo, exosome;
  p-, phosphorylated; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; HUVEC, human umbilical
  vein endothelial cell; Cdc42, cell division control protein 42; FGD5, FYVE, RhoGEF
  and PH domain containing 5.
