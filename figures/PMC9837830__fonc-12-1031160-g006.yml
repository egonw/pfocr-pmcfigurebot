caption: RNF128 promotes colorectal cancer progression in nude mice. (A, B) Tumors
  derived from nude mice injected with shNC and shRNF128 LoVo cells (n=5 per group).
  Tumor growth curves were generated, and tumor weight was measured. **P<0.001. (C)
  IHC analysis was used to assess the expression of Hippo pathway components in tumors.
article_title: Ring finger protein 128 promotes, rather than inhibits, colorectal
  cancer progression by regulating the Hippo signaling pathway.
