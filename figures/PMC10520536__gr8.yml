caption: 'The role of NET1 in myocardial infarction in mice(A) The protein level of
  α-SMA in mouse model. n = 5, ∗∗p = 0.0088 Sham vs. MI, ∗∗p < 0.0001 MI vs. KO, ∗∗p
  = 0.0088 KO vs. KO + MI, by Kruskal-Wallis test, ∗∗p = 0.0079 KO + MI vs. MI by
  Mann Whitney test.(B) The protein level of collagen I (n = 3, ∗p = 0.0415 Sham vs.
  MI, ∗∗p = 0.0022 MI vs. KO, ∗p = 0.0415 KO vs. KO + MI) and hydroxyproline in mouse
  model (n = 6, ∗∗p = 0.0013 Sham vs. MI, ∗∗p = 0.0046 MI vs. KO, ∗p = 0.0479 MI vs.
  KO + MI by Kruskal-Wallis test).(C and D) The protein level of NET1 in mouse model.
  n = 3, ∗∗p = 0.0032 MI vs. KO, ∗p = 0.0415 MI vs. KO + MI. (D) The protein level
  of β-catenin in mouse MI model. n = 4, ∗p = 0.0143 Sham vs. MI, ∗∗p = 0.0005 MI
  vs. KO, ∗p = 0.0213 KO vs. KO + MI by Kruskal-Wallis test. ∗p = 0.0286 KO + MI vs.
  MI by Mann Whitney test.(E) The protein level of GSK3β-S389 in mouse MI model. n
  = 3, ∗p = 0.0022 MI vs. KO by Kruskal-Wallis test. The protein level of GSK3β-S9
  in mouse MI model. n = 3∗p = 0.0022 MI vs. KO by Kruskal-Wallis test. For all statistical
  plots, the data are presented as mean ± SEM.(F) Changes of myocardial ultrastructure
  in each group. The ultrastructure of cardiomyocytes was observed under electron
  microscope. Magnification, ×15000. Scale bar calibration: 2 μm; The heart tissues
  of mice in each group were observed by Masson staining. Masson staining was used
  to observe the heart tissue. Scale bar calibration: 100 μm.'
