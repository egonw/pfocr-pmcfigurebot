caption: Ire1 phosphorylation in enterovirus-infected cells as revealed by Western
  blot analysis with anti-p-Ire1 antibodies. (A) Phosphorylated Ire1 and total Î²-actin
  levels in HeLa cells infected with PV type I Mahoney. (B) The same for HeLa cells
  infected with CVB3. Representative results of at least three independent experiments
  are shown. (C) Accumulation of viral proteins throughout the infection cycle of
  PV and CVB3 in HeLa cells.
