caption: 'NF-κB (p65 subunit) DNA binding capacity in nuclear extracts of HL60R cell
  line. The cells were treated for 24 h with compounds at the corresponding IC50 values.
  Results are expressed as arbitrary units/μg protein of HL60R nuclear extracts and
  the mean ± SE of three independent observations, * p < 0.01 versus control; ap <
  0.05: AO derivates versus precursor, Ap < 0.05: LU derivates versus precursor (one-way
  ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test).'
