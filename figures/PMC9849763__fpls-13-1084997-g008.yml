caption: Expression profiles of ET signaling and biosynthesis pathway genes upon ET
  and 1-MCP treatment along ripening time course. (A) Schematic diagram showing ET
  biosynthesis (pink box) and ET signaling (blue box) beginning from a precursor,
  S-adenosyl methionine (SAM). Gene names responsible for each step of ET biosynthesis
  and signaling pathway were indicated with italicized blue-colored letters. Expression
  levels of genes related to each step of ET biosynthesis and signaling pathway were
  presented as a heatmap. Red cube represents upregulated gene expression, and green
  cube represents downregulated gene expression compared to the level of the control
  sample. ET, ethylene; 1-MCP, 1-methylcyclopropene. (B) Transcript levels of AcEIL
  (Acc32482) in the control, ET-treated, and 1-MCP-treated samples along four different
  time course (0D, 3D, 5D, and 7D). ET, ethylene; 1-MCP, 1-methylcyclopropene. Data
  represent the mean of the transcript values from three biological replicates with
  error bars showing standard deviation (n=3). One-way ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey’s
  test (p < 0.05) was applied to calculate the statistical significance, and significant
  difference was indicated in the figures by different letters (p < 0.05).
