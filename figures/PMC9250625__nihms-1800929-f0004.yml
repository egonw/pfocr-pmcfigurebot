figure_title: The RSI describes distinct tumor immune microenvironments
caption: (a) RSIlo versus RSIhi tumors were compared with single sample gene set enrichment
  analysis (ssGSEA) using the MSigDB hallmark pathway genes related to immune signaling.
  Heatmap intensity depicts the -log p-value of the Fisher exact test multiplied by
  the directionality of expression difference; enriched in RSIlo (red) or RSIhi (blue).
  Tumor types are ordered by the immune score. (b) Tumor types are ordered by immune
  score and normalized CIBERSORT immune cell infiltrate estimates are compared within
  a given tumor type by dichotomizing at the median RSI value to identify RSIlo and
  RSIhi tumors. Immune cell infiltrates involved in the innate (left panel) and the
  adaptive (right panel) response. Hypothesis tests (Fisher’s exact test) in tumor
  types between RSIhi and RSIlo were performed; a black bar beneath the comparison
  denotes false-discovery rate adjusted q < 0.05. Black bars to the right of heatmap
  indicate proportion of significant tumor types for given immune cell infiltrate
  enrichment comparison between RSIlo and RSIhi tumors. (d) Associations of IFNα and
  the RSI with immune cell (IC) subtypes as independent or coordinated biology. Half-circles
  represent whether comparison within a tumor type and IC subtype are significant
  (q < 0.05); red (RSI vs IC), blue (IFNα vs IC). Empty circles imply no association
  between variables. Tumor types are ordered by immune score.
