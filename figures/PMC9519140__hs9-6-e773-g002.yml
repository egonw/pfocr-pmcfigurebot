caption: 'Crosstalk between primary LSECs and HCs is critical to induce Bmp6 mRNA
  levels in response to iron. (A and B), Primary mouse LSECs and HCs were maintained
  together (LSEC + HC) or separately and incubated with 50 μM of FeNTA for 6 and 15 h.
  The 2 time points represent 2 independent experiments. (C), Freshly prepared primary
  mouse LSECs were treated with unconditioned medium (med) supplemented or not with
  50 μM of FeNTA for 6 h, or with medium from HC primary culture treated or not with
  50 μM of FeNTA for 18 h (med(HC + FeNTA)). (D and E), Primary mouse LSECs were cultivated
  in HC derived medium, whereby HC remained untreated (med(HC)). Fifty μM of FeNTA
  was then added for 1, 3, and 6. (F and G), Hepatocyte conditioned medium (med(HC))
  was heat-inactivated at 95°C, 30 min, and insoluble proteins were precipitated by
  high-speed centrifugation. (F), Coomassie blue staining of med(HC) boiled or unboiled.
  (G), Primary mouse LSECs were incubated with untreated or heat-inactivated med(HC)
  supplemented or not with 50 μM FeNTA. (H and I), Proteinase K was immobilized on
  agarose resin and used to digest proteins secreted in the med(HC). (H), Proteinase
  K treated and untreated medium was loaded on a SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie
  blue or (I) used to cultivate primary LSECs in presence or absence of 50 μM FeNTA.
  Total RNA was extracted and mRNA expression of (A, D) Tfr1 (Tfrc) and (B, C, E,
  G, I) Bmp6 was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Gene expression was normalized to the housekeeping
  gene Rpl19. All treatments were performed in serum-free medium. A minimum of 3 biological
  replicates per condition is shown. A minimum of 2 independent experiments with at
  least 3 biological replicates was performed. (J), Schematic representation of BMP6
  regulation in response to iron. LSEC-secreted BMP6 induces hepcidin by activating
  SMAD1/5/8 signaling pathway in hepatocytes. The combination of a ubiquitously secreted
  hepatocyte molecule and iron induces BMP6 in LSECs that, subsequently, contributes
  to hepcidin upregulation. Data are represented as relative quantification to vehicle
  treated cells and reported as mean ± SEM. Two-tailed Student t test and 2-way ANOVA
  were calculated: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001. BMP6 = bone
  morphogenetic protein 6; BMPR = bone morphogenetic protein receptor; BMP-RE = bone
  morphogenetic protein responsive element; FeNTA = iron nitrilotriacetate; HC = hepatocyte;
  LSECs = liver sinusoidal endothelial cells; med = medium; mRNA = messenger RNA;
  MW = molecular weight; ns = not significant; ProtK = proteinase K; qRT-PCR = quantitative
