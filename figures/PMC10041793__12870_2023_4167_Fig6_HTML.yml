caption: Roles of the CAS gene family and AOX in the plant response to stress conditions.
  In Arabidopsis, environmental stress, such as salt stress, leads to cyanide accumulation
  in the cytoplasm due to the hydrolysis of cyanohydrin and as a byproduct of ethylene
  synthesis. Previous studies have shown that CYS-C1 plays a major role in cyanide
  detoxification in the mitochondria, while CYS-D1 and CYS-D2 play a role in the cytoplasm
  []. The results of this study indicate that CYS-C1 is a key member of the CAS gene
  family involved in cyanide detoxification. Notably, AOX plays an active role in
  respiratory homeostasis when plants are exposed to stress conditions, especially
  when the cytochrome c pathway is damaged by adverse conditions and toxic chemicals
  such as HCN and H2S. Therefore, it can be concluded that CAS and AOX synergistically
  contribute to the tolerance of Arabidopsis seeds and seedlings to salt stress
