caption: 'The Rab22 promoted invasion and migration of thyroid cancer cells was weakened
  by PI3K inhibitors. Transwell assays showed that the migration and invasion of TPC1
  and K1 cells decreased by PI3K inhibitors (a, 200×). The migration of TPC1 and K1
  cells was assessed by wound healing assays (b, 200×). Statistical data were the
  mean ± SD of the three repeated independent trials: ∗∗∗P < 0.001, ∗∗P < 0.01, and
  ∗P < 0.05.'
