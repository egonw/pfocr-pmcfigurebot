caption: Knockdown of SQLE affects the P53 signaling pathway and PTEN/AKT/GSK3β signaling
  pathway. (A) The top 147 genes associated with SQLE were constructed with a PPI
  network (23 genes were not found in the STRING platform); (B) KEGG enrichment analysis
  of genes in PPI network; (C) GO enrichment analysis of genes in PPI network; (D)
  Protein expression levels of P53, PTEN, AKT, P-AKT, GSK3β, and P-GSK3β in T24 and
  5637 cells; (E–G) Representative images of P53, PTEN, and P-AKT immunostaining.
  Data represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001 versus the vector group, ns, not significant)
