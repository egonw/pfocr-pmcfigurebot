caption: Prognostic value of the E2F-Clust and E2F-targets pathway. (A) Three mutual
  pathways were identified by taking an intersection of the results from the Least
  Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator model and the random survival forest model.
  (B) Prognostic value of three hub pathways. Only E2F-targets pathway was a significant
  risk factor for thyroid cancer. (C, D) E2F-Clust stratified the patients into two
  groups with a distinct difference in survival outcome (C) and clinical TNM stages
  (D).
