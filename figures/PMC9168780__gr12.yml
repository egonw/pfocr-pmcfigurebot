caption: 'The various roles of H2S in the stimulation of EMT in cancer cells. H2S
  can stimulate Wnt/β-catenin pathway through: Sp3 transcription factor upregulation
  that, in turn, upregulate ACLY. ACLY interacts with β-catenin and may block β-catenin
  ubiquitination leading to its accumulation in the cytoplasm which, in turn, also
  translocates into the nucleus. In the nucleus, β-catenin binds to LEF and activates
  Twist1 and Snail1 transcription factors. H2S can stimulate PI3K/Akt pathway, which
  upregulates HIF1α, or induces Snail1 transcription factors expression through NF-κB.
  H2S can also stimulate the MEK/ERK pathway, leading to the activation of the transcription
  factor AP1. H2S can stimulate TGFβ pathway through: Smad2/3 activation, which, in
  turn, activates the transcription factor Snail1. H2S can stimulate p38MAPK pathway,
  either by activation of the upstream kinases MKKx which consequently phosphorylate
  p38MAPK or by the autophosphorylation of p38MAPK. Under hypoxic conditions H2S can
  induce HIF-1α expression and further up-regulate VEGFA and the transcription factor
  Twist1. Some of these pathways are interconnected and can be activated at the same
  time. Possible crosstalks between these pathways are indicated by brown arrows.
  The bell-shaped effect H2S should be emphasized in the above processes, meaning
  that these pathways can be upregulated during EMT in cancer cells, however this
  process can be reverted if additional H2S is added to the cells or if the H2S biosynthesis
  is inhibited in cancer cells. (For interpretation of the references to color in
  this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)'
