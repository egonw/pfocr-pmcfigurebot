caption: 'TIIA modulates protein expression of the TGF-β1/Smad pathway molecules.
  (A) Western blot analysis of TGF-β1, α-SMA and Smad7 protein levels in rat livers.
  Results were normalized relative to β-actin. (B) Quantification of TGF-β1 (NASH-F
  vs. control, P=0.013; and TIIA vs. NASH-F, P=0.024), α-SMA (NASH-F vs. control,
  P=0.019; and TIIA vs. NASH-F, P=0.018) and Smad7 (NASH-F vs. control, P=0.012; and
  TIIA vs. NASH-F, P=0.300) shown in A. (C) Western blot analysis of p-Smad2/3 and
  Smad2/3 protein levels in rat livers. Results were normalized relative to β-actin.
  (D) Quantification of p-Smad2/3 (NASH-F vs. control P=0.049; and TIIA vs. NASH-F,
  P=0.031) and Smad2/3 (NASH-F vs. control, P=0.776; and TIIA vs. NASH-F, P=0.778)
  shown in C. (E) Ratio of p-Smad2/3 over total Smad2/3 expression (NASH-F vs. control,
  P=0.022; and TIIA vs. NASH-F, P=0.022). #P<0.05; *P<0.05 (n=3). NASH-F, non-alcoholic
  steatohepatitis-related fibrosis; TIIA, tanshinone IIA; p, phosphorylated; α-SMA,
  α-smooth muscle actin.'
