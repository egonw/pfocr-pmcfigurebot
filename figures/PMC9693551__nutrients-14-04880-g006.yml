caption: '(CGA) Chlorogenic acid, (TC) toasted coffee extract, and (GC) green coffee
  extract modulation of the mRNA expression levels of CDH1, in green bars (which encodes
  for E-cadherin); CTNNB1, in blue bars (which encodes for β-catenin); and CCND1,
  in red bars (which encodes for Cyclin D1) in SW480 (A) and HT-29 (B) cell lines.
  Values are expressed as the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments. Two-way
  ANOVA, difference to non-treated cells, * p ≤ 0.05 and ** p ≤ 0.01. ns: non-significant
  differences.'
