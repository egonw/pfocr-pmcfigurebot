caption: A proposed regulatory model for mitigating the effect of exogenous melatonin
  on rice seedlings under drought stress. The solid boxes represent the results of
  the well-documented studies, and the dashed boxes represent the results of this
  study. The diamond boxes represent substrates, intermediates, and final products
  in the melatonin synthesis pathway. The boxes represent synthetases, and the colored
  boxes represent two rate-limiting synthetases encoded by TDC2 and ASMT1 in this
  study.
