  and siP65 treatment at 24 h (B). siNC: non‐targeting control siRNA‐treated group;
  siP65: P65‐siRNA‐treated group. Protein bands and protein expressions of HDFs with
  human platelet lysate (hPL) and prostratin treatment (C). Cell viability of HDFs
  with hPL and prostratin at 24 h (D). Data expressed as mean ± SD. NS: no significant
  difference. *p < 0.05 or **p < 0.01 by one‐way ANOVA followed by least significant
  difference multiple comparison. We repeated the experiments three times to ensure
  the accuracy of the experiments'
