figure_title: In vitro reconstruction of Esculeoside A biosynthesis
caption: Consecutive activities of the recombinant SlGAME31, SlGAME36, SlGAME40, and
  SlGAME5 proteins (produced separately in E. coli cells) convert α-tomatine to Esculeoside
  A in a single tube reaction. Aligned ion chromatograms from LC-MS (short 15 min.
  run) are presented. The control reaction (shown in black) was performed with α-tomatine
  as substrate using extracts from E. coli cells transformed with an empty pET28 vector.
  For in vitro production of each intermediate in the Esculeoside A pathway, sequential
  assays with the corresponding GAME enzymes were performed. Mass to charge (m/z)
  is shown for α-tomatine and the assay products (i.e., Esculeoside A pathway intermediates).
