caption: APE1 and its nuclease activity is important for ATR–Chk1 DDR pathway in mammalian
  cells. (A) siRNA-mediated APE1-knockdown impaired H2O2-induced ATR–Chk1 DDR pathway
  in MDA-MB-231 cells. Total cell lysates were extracted and analyzed via immunoblotting
  analysis as indicated. (B, C) The H2O2-induced Chk1 phosphorylation was compromised
  by AR03 or APE1i III at different doses (5, 10, or 15 μM for 2 h) in MDA-MB-231
  cells. (D) The H2O2-induced Chk1 phosphorylation was reduced in APE1-KD PANC1 cells.
  (E, F) The H2O2-induced Chk1 phosphorylation was impaired by AR03 or APE1i III in
  a dose-dependent manner (5, 10 or 15 μM for 2 h) in PANC1 cells. (A–F) ‘Chk1-P-S345/Chk1’
  was quantified by the intensity of Chk1-P-S345 versus total Chk1. Means ± SD, n = 3.
  (G) AR03 or APE1i III but not E3330 inhibited APE1’s endonuclease activity. Different
  doses of AR03, APE1i III, or E3330 (1, 2, or 5 mM) was added to endonuclease assays
  containing 0.185 μM APE1 protein and a 5’-FAM-labeled dsDNA-AP substrate. After
  incubation for 30 min, samples were analyzed via 20% TBE gel. (H) AR03 or Inhibitor
  III could inhibit APE1’s exo-nuclease activity. Different doses of AR03, APE1i III,
  or E3330 (1, 2 or 5 mM) was added to exonuclease assays containing 0.185 μM APE1
  protein and 5’-FAM-labeled dsDNA-SSB substrate. After 30-min incubation, samples
  were examined via 20% TBE gel.
