caption: 'TDP-43 connections to RTE detrimental action in ALS. (A) Overview of the
  general consequences of TDP-43 alterations in DNA stability and cellular homeostasis
  due to RTE inhibition failure. (B–E) TDP-43 impact on ALS through the misregulation
  of RTE. In the cartoons, regulatory sequences (promoter regions), i.e., LTRs in
  exogenous and endogenous ERVs, and 5′UTR in Lines, are in blue; retroviral gag,
  pro, and pol genes produced from the same (polycistronic) transcript are in white;
  and the env gene produced by an alternatively spliced transcript is in purple. ORFs
  for accessory proteins (Tat in HIV, rec and np9 or rec in HERV-K) are depicted.
  Specificities of each class/specific elements and impact on ALS are listed on the
  right of each cartoon. (B) TDP-43 is able to repress HIV-1 provirus activation.
  TDP-43 binds to the TAR binding site within the 5′LTR R region and represses transcription.
  This binding was shown to impede the binding of TAR RNA and Tat-activating protein.
  A reduction in TDP-43 binding (by ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation) can
  reverse HIV-1 provirus latency, potentially leading to the production of infectious
  viral particles (HIV virion). It is known that HIV-1 can promote ALS-like symptoms.
  HIV can also activate HERV-K elements, notably via Tat []. (C) TDP-43 overexpression
  binds to and activates specific HERV-K HML-2 provirus(es), producing the toxic env
  glycoprotein HERV(HML-2). The HERV-K proviruses found activated in ALS cases (ALS
  neurons shows immunoreactivity for HERV-K Env) could be HERV-K C7-C and HERV-K C10-A,
  which are polymorphic proviruses in the human population. TDP-43 binds to the LTR5Hs
  sequence at a polypyrimidine track in the U3 region (5′-CCCTCTCCC-3′) with high
  affinity and is able to activate the LTR-promoted transcription. Conversely, HERV-K
  Env potentially triggers TDP-43 upregulation. (D) In Drosophila, the failure of
  TDP-43 to indirectly repress Gypsy retrovirus, a family of endogenous LTR-retrotranposon,
  leads to cell autonomous and non-autonomous toxicity. The family contains copies
  with preserved ORFs, capable of retrotransposition and replication. TDP-43 alterations
  (hTDP-43 overexpression or fly TDP-43 homologue TDPH null) induce the activation,
  specifically in glial cells, of Gypsy copies. It is not clear if replication involves
  infectious or non-virus-like particles (VLP). Mechanistically, TDP-43 binds to and
  positively regulates Dicer-2 (Dicer in the human) mRNA and protein. Dicer-2 in the
  RISC complex controls Gypsy and other RTE activity via the endo-siRNA pathway, inhibiting
  or impeding transduction by promoting mRNA degradation. Lack of TDP-43 by reducing
  Dicer-2 levels impedes endo-siRNA-mediated control (see text for more detail). (E)
  TDP-43 nuclear loss in the neurons of ALS patients induces L1 expression. TDP-43
  represses human L1 by at least two mechanisms: (i) by binding at the 5′UTR promotes
  and maintaining L1 heterochromatinization; and (ii) by interacting with the ORF2p
  in cases of L1 retrotransposition, inhibiting the pasting of new copies into the
  host genome.'
