caption: Lys re-supplementation restores the muscle differentiation and the repressed
  Wnt/Ca2+pathway induced by Lys deficiency in slow muscle and suppresses the Wnt/Ca2+pathway
  in fast muscle. Expression assays of MyHC and key proteins (Myogenin, and MRF4)
  of the myogenic factor family in fast (semimembranosus; a,c) and slow (semitendinosus;
  b,d) muscles on day 29 of the trial. Expression assays for key proteins of the Wnt/Ca2+pathway
  (PKC, CaN, CaMKII, and NFATc1) in fast (semimembranosus; e,g) and slow (semitendinosus;
  f,h) muscles on test day 29. * indicates p < 0.05, ** indicates p < 0.01.
