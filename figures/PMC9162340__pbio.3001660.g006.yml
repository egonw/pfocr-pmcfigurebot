figure_title: The BLT motif positively supports Dpp signaling
caption: '(A–E) Ectopic activity of overexpressed Punt was diminished upon apicalization.
  p-Mad pattern in the wing disc for control (A) and en>Punt[BLT] proteins (B–D).
  Ectopic p-Mad staining is marked by brackets (B–D). The ratio of p-Mad signal from
  the posterior compartment (en-positive) versus anterior compartment increased for
  each Punt[BLT] protein, but less so for Punt[Wit] (** p < 0.01 Punt[Wit] versus
  Punt[Punt]) (E). (F–M) Apicalized Punt did not fully support Dpp signaling or wing
  development at a dosage of one copy. Representative wing disc p-Mad staining from
  put mutant larvae rescued by the indicated construct (F–I), shown as false color
  Fire scale of MIPs. Note reduced p-Mad intensity in the pouch region above the bracket
  in panels H-I. Δ19 animals showed a variable morphology, with 4 of 11 discs having
  an abnormal furrow along the A/P boundary (gray arrow in panel I). (J–M) Wings from
  adults from rescued genotypes. Δ19 wings (L, M) showed variability in vein patterns
  (arrow in M). (N, P) Signaling and tissue patterning is dose dependent. Two copies
  of the Δ19 rescue construct boosted Dpp signaling to normal levels (N, O). One-copy
  images (F–I) are from one staining batch and 2-copy images (N, O) are from a different
  staining batch. Developmental defects were only observed with the Δ19 construct
  at a dosage of one copy (P). Scale bars: 100 μm A–D, F–I, N, O; 500 μm for J–M.

  targeting; Dpp, Decapentaplegic.'
