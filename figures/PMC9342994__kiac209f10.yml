caption: Castor PDCT and DGAT2 working in concert to enhance tri-ricinoleoyl glycerol
  amount in castor seeds. Proposed acyl flow in TAG synthetic pathway in castor endosperm.
  De novo synthesis of DAG via G3P pathway gives rise to DAG with two (2-OH-DAG) and
  one (1-OH-DAG) ricinoleoyl groups (mainly located in the sn-2 position). 1-OH-DAG
  is preferentially exchanged with PC with no ricinoleoyl groups (0-OH-PC) by PDCT.
  The ricinoleoyl group in 1-OH-PC derived from DAG is rapidly replaced with a nonhydroxylated
  acyl group and the ricinoleate is recycled in the G3P pathway to mainly yield 2-OH-DAG
  or used by PDAT to form 3-OH-TAG. Ricinoleoyl-containing DAG is mainly acylated
  with ricinoleoyl groups by DGAT2. However, DAG with no ricinoleoyl groups (0-OH-DAG)
  is strongly selected against in presence of DAG with ricinoleoyl groups. Thus, a
  DAG pool with acyl composition similar to PC and not used in TAG synthesis replaces
  the 1-OH-DAG shunted to PC and can be used in membrane lipid synthesis. PDAT reaction
  is not depicted in the figure but can be predicted to have the same high selectivity
  for ricinoleoyl-containing substrates as DGAT2 (; ). ER, endoplasmic reticulum.
