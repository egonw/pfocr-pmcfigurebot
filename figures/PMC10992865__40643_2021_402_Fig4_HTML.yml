caption: 'Differentially expressed genes generated by transcriptome analysis in YPM
  media after 24Â h of incubation. a Volcano plot of the differentially expressed genes
  in M3. The horizontal coordinate represented the fold change, and the vertical coordinate
  represented a significant difference Padjust (logarithmic transformation at the
  base of 10). Red dots represented up-regulated genes, and green dots represented
  down-regulated genes. b, c Histogram of GO enrichment and KEGG pathway enrichment
  analysis. The vertical coordinate shows the enriched GO terms and the pathway names,
  and the horizontal coordinate represents the number of genes and Padjust of differentially
  expressed genes in the term and the pathway, respectively. d Overview of significantly
  changed genes in metabolic pathways. Pentose phosphate pathway (oxidative phase,
  yellow; non-oxidative phase, blue): GND, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase; 6PGL,
  6-phosphogluconolactonase; 6PGD, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; TKL, transketolase;
  TAL, transaldolase. Glycolysis and gluconeogenesis (green): HXK, hexokinase; PGI,
  phosphoglucose isomerase; INO1, inositol-3-phosphate synthase; PFK, phosphofructokinase;
  FBP1, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase; FBPA, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase; GAPD: glyceraldehyde
  phosphate dehydrogenase; PGK, phosphoglycerate kinase; PGM, phosphoglycerate mutase;
  ENO, enolase'
