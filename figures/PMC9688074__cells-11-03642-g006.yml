caption: Mechanism of lncRNAs in lung inflammatory injury. Knockdown of lncRNA XIST
  regulates the JAK/STAT3 and NF-κB signaling pathways by targeting miR-370-3p/TLR4,
  thereby inhibiting acute pneumonia. Knockdown of lncRNA XIST alleviates acute lung
  injury by regulating the miR-132-3p/MAPK14 pathway. Downregulation of lncRNA MINCR
  regulates the TRAF6 expression levels by targeting miR-146b-5p, thereby inhibiting
  NF-κB activation and attenuating ALI. Low expression of lncRNA MIAT inhibits the
  activation of NF-κB pathway by targeting miR-147a/NKAP axis, thereby alleviating
  the damage of pneumonia.
