caption: Up-regulated expression of RPL5 in COAD. A Data from TCGA database demonstrated
  a significant upregulation of RPL5 expression in COAD tumor samples (n = 290) compared
  with normal tissue (n = 41). B Data from GTEx database and TCGA tumor tissue demonstrated
  a significant upregulation of RPL5 expression in COAD tumor samples (n = 290) compared
  with normal tissue (n = 349). C Nine pairs of cancer tissues and paired adjacent
  tissues from clinical colon cancer patients were collected, and the differential
  expression of RPL5 in colon cancer tissues and paired adjacent tissues was detected
  by western blotting. The blots were cut prior to hybridization with antibodies during
  blotting. D The proteins of human normal colon epithelial cells NCM460 and colon
  cancer cells HCT116, HT29, RKO, SW480 and KM12 were extracted, and the expression
  of RPL5 in colon cancer was detected by western blotting. The blots were cut prior
  to hybridization with antibodies during blotting. E The TCGA database was used to
  analyze the correlation between the expression of RPL5 and the stage of clinical
  colon cancer patients
