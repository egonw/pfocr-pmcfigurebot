caption: RNF128 inhibits the Hippo pathway in colorectal cancer. (A) RNF128 was correlated
  with Hippo pathway proteins (LATS, YAP, and TAZ) in CRC according to StarBase. (B)
  RNF128 was downregulated in LoVo and HCT116 cells transfected with si-NC and si-RNF128,
  as shown by western blot analysis. **P<0.001. (C) Western blot analysis was used
  to measure the protein expression of components of the Hippo pathway (MST, p-MST,
  LATS, p-LATS, YAP, p-YAP, and TAZ) in LoVo and HCT116 cells with RNF128 knockdown.
  **P<0.001.
