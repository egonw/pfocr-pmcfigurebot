caption: 'Biosynthesis of PR-toxin: (a) PR-toxin biosynthetic gene cluster in P. roqueforti.
  The cluster initially described by García–Estrada and Martín [] includes genes represented
  as green (contig Proq06) and blue arrows contig (Proq02), whereas the cluster later
  described by Hidalgo et al., 2017 includes genes represented as blue and orange
  arrows (ORF 1 to ORF 11). The nomenclature of each gene, according to its position
  in each contig, is also indicated in black color; (b) Proposed biosynthetic pathway
  for PR-toxin in P. roqueforti. The alternative steps for the transformation of Eremofortin
  B to Eremofortin A are indicated with red arrows. Eremofortin A has been suggested
  to be either a shunt product or an intermediate (in blue brackets) adapted from
  [,,].'
