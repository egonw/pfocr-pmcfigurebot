caption: Inhibition of APLN activated PI3L.Akt signaling pathway in esophageal cancer
  cells. Cells were transfected with APLN siRNA to knockdown APLN, and Western Blot
  was performed to analyze PI3/Akt signaling pathway (A) and quantitative (B); *p<0.05
  compared to scramble.
article_title: Inhibition of APLN suppresses cell proliferation and migration and
  promotes cell apoptosis in esophageal cancer cells in vitro, through activating
  PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway.
