caption: The fluorescence distribution of LC3 in MDBK cells after different treatment
  times of HG stimulation. MDBK cells were treated with 25.5 mM glucose for 0, 3,
  6, 12, and 24 h, respectively. LC3 was labeled with red fluorescence by Cy3, and
  the nucleus was labeled with blue fluorescence by DAPI. Scale bar, 10 Âµm.
