caption: 'Role of plasma membrane PI(4,5)P2 and protein prenylation in actin dynamics.
  A: To explore the specific contribution of PI(4,5)P2-mediated regulation on F-actin
  dynamics, we chose a distal inhibitor of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway that
  minimally affects isoprenoid biosynthesis (e.g., farnesyl pyrophosphate, an important
  lipid attachment for the post-translational modification of a variety of small GTPase
  proteins that are key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton). For this, we utilized
  AY 9944, which is a specific metabolic inhibitor of 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase
  (7-DHCR), the last enzyme in the Kandutsch-Russell pathway of cholesterol biosynthesis,
  that catalyzes the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) to cholesterol. The
  two-way color scheme (inhibition [gray] and operational [blue]) is suggestive of
  modulation of specific steps of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway upon AY 9944
  treatment. The dotted arrows represent multiple intermediate steps. B: Membrane
  cholesterol content of CHO-K1 cells treated with increasing concentrations of AY
  9944. Sterols were extracted and quantitated using GC-MS analysis and identified
  with pure standards. Values are expressed as absolute cholesterol content in cell
  membranes and are normalized to protein content. Data represent means ± SEM of three
  independent experiments (∗∗ and ∗∗∗ correspond to a significant difference [P <
  0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively] in membrane cholesterol content in AY 9944-treated
  cells relative to untreated cells). C: Values obtained upon quantitation of F-actin
  (as described in ) in control and AY 9944-treated cells. Data represent means ±
  SEM of ∼35 different fields from at least three independent experiments (∗ and ∗∗
  correspond to significant differences [P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively] in F-actin
  content in AY 9944-treated cells relative to untreated cells). D: Effect of sequestering
  PI(4,5)P2 on F-actin dynamics. Representative confocal micrographs showing organization
  of F-actin in control and cells treated with increasing concentrations of neomycin.
  Increase in F-actin filaments can be observed upon treatment with increasing concentrations
  of neomycin. Panels on the right represent the iso-surfaces corresponding to MIPs
  shown in left panels. The scale bars represent 10 μm. Values obtained upon quantitation
  of F-actin in control and cells treated with neomycin are shown in panel (E). Data
  represent means ± SEM of ∼10 different fields from three independent experiments
  (∗∗ and ∗∗∗ correspond to significant [P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively] differences
  in F-actin content in neomycin-treated cells relative to control cells). F: To explore
  the specific contribution of protein prenylation (an important post-translational
  modification of a variety of small GTPase proteins that are key regulators of the
  actin cytoskeleton) on F-actin dynamics, we used lovastatin as a proximal inhibitor
  of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Lovastatin is a specific metabolic inhibitor
  of HMG-coA reductase (HMGR), the rate-limiting enzyme upstream of isoprenoid intermediates
  in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. In order to replenish membrane cholesterol
  in cells during lovastatin treatment, cells were grown in the presence of excess
  serum, which effectively replenishes cholesterol metabolically. The color scheme
  is same as in panel A. G: Membrane cholesterol content of CHO-K1 cells treated with
  increasing concentrations of lovastatin in media containing 20% (v/v) serum. Data
  represent means ± SEM of three independent experiments. Values are expressed as
  absolute cholesterol content in cell membranes and are normalized to protein content.
  H: Values obtained upon quantitation of F-actin (as described in ) in control and
  lovastatin-treated cells. Data represent means ± SEM of ∼20 different fields from
  at least three independent experiments (∗∗ corresponds to a significant difference
  [P < 0.01] in F-actin content in lovastatin-treated cells relative to untreated
  cells). See  for more details.'
