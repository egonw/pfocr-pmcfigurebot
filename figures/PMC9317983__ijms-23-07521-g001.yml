caption: Among the genes involved in the polyamine metabolic pathway, PAOX is most
  significantly altered by E2 treatment at the RNA level. Schematic diagram of the
  polyamine metabolic pathway (A). MCF-7 cells were incubated with or without E2 for
  24 h. Levels of AMD1, ODC1, SRM, SMS, SMOX, SAT1, PAOX, GREB1, and GAPDH mRNAs were
  evaluated by conventional (B) and quantitative (C) PCR. Data are shown as the mean
  ± S.D. (n = 3), normalized to GAPDH expression. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01 versus control.
