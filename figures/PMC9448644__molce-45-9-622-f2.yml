figure_title: Direct regulation of CHOP expression by EHMT1
caption: (A) DAVID-based GO analysis of the upregulated genes among the 930 DEGs in
  the RNA-seq results. (B) GO pathway term enrichment networks. GO pathway term networks
  in the EHMT1 knockdown and control groups were functionally grouped by ClueGO. The
  cutoff value was set at P > 0.05. (C) Expression levels of CHOP, PLK3, DRAM1, EBAG9,
  S100A14, and LGALS1 in the RNA-seq results after transfection of siEHMT1. (D) qRT-PCR
  analysis of CHOP expression after transfection of siEHMT1 into HCT116 (left) and
  HT-29 (right) cell lines. The mean ± SD of three independent experiments is shown.
  P values were calculated using Student’s t-test (***P < 0.001). (E) Western blotting
  analysis after EHMT1 knockdown using anti-EHMT1 and anti-CHOP antibodies. ACTB was
  used as the internal control in HCT116 and HT-29 cells. The signal intensities were
  quantified using ImageJ software. IB, immunoblot. (F) Graphical abstract of design
  of ChIP primers specific for the CHOP promoter region (left). The ChIP assay was
  performed using an anti-H3K9me2 antibody. The results are expressed as a percentage
  of input chromatin compared with the control in HCT116 cells after siEHMT1 treatment.
  The mean ± SD of three independent experiments is shown. P values were calculated
  using Student’s t-test (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001) (right).
