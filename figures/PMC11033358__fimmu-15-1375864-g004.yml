caption: Clinical features of different risk sore subgroups. (A) Heatmap showing the
  clinical characteristics (age, grade, stage, T, M, N, etc.) and risk score groups
  of 368 HCC patients in TCGA set. (B) Heatmap and table showing the distribution
  of Grade subtypes (G1, G2, G3 and G4) and Stage subtypes (Stage I, Stage II, Stage
  III and Stage IV), between the risk score subgroups. (C) Comparison of different
  risk scores with Grade and Stage in the TCGA set. **, p < 0.01; ***, p<0.001.
