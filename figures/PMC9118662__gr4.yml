caption: 'RA pathway association with TNFi response. A. Percentage of pathways linked
  to RA (n=246) that were significantly associated to the discovery cohort (left bar
  plots). From these, the middle bar plots indicate the percentage of significantly
  validated pathways in the validation cohort. Finally, the right bar plots show the
  percentage of validated pathways that have consistent methylation changes between
  the two patient cohorts using the resampling-based test. wk0: pathways associated
  with TNFi response at week 0; wk12: pathways associated with TNFi response at week
  12; wk12 vs wk0: pathways changing from week 0 to week 12 of TNFi therapy; R vs
  NR: pathways showing longitudinal methylation differences between responders and
  non-responders to TNFi therapy. B. Association results in the validation cohort
  of the RA pathways associated with TNFi response at week 0 in the discovery cohort.
  Four pathways were found to be significantly replicated (red bars, FDR < 0.05).
  C. Association results in the validation cohort of the RA pathways associated with
  TNFi response at week 12 in the discovery cohort. One pathway, regulation of small
  GTPase signal transduction was found to be significantly replicated (red bar, FDR
  < 0.05).'
