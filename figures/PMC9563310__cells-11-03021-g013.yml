caption: In vivo DNA binding assay revealed enhanced enrichment of Bmal1 to its binding
  at E-Box and Nrf2 to its ARE sites of Prdx6 promoter in Metformin-treated SRA-hLECs.
  Diagrammatic sketch of the 5′-constructs of Prdx6 promoter containing Bmal1/E-Box-
  and Nrf2/ARE-DNA binding sites and ChIP primers sequences used for ChIP assay shown
  in A. (B,C) DNA binding experiments with SRA-hLECs treated with Metformin was performed
  as noted in . Increased binding of Bmal1 and Nrf2 to its responsive elements in
  the Prdx6 promoter was observed, suggesting SRA-hLECs responded similarly with Metformin
  as primary hLECs, suggesting SRA-hLECs are a good alternative for primary hLECs
  to elucidate the mechanism(s) of protective activity of therapeutic molecules. Chromatin
  samples were prepared from SRA-hLECs treated with different concentrations of Metformin
  and were submitted to ChIP assay with ChIP grade antibodies anti-Bmal1 (B) and anti-Nrf2
  (C) and anti-IgG (B,C). Immunoprecipitated DNA fragments were purified and processed
  for PCR analysis using primers that specifically recognize fragments of Bmal1 and
  Nrf2 binding site (−400 to −305) of human Prdx6 gene promoter as indicated. Immunoprecipitated/pulled
  DNA fragments were subjected to RT-PCR analysis. Fragmented DNA was amplified with
  primers that specifically recognized a fragment of human Prdx6 promoter containing
  E-Box or ARE site. 10% sheared chromatin was used as input. Control IgG was used
  as negative control. (D) Bmal1 knockdown SRA-hLECs involvement of Metformin to enhance
  the Bmal1 binding to E-Box in the Prdx6 promoter in vivo. SRA-hLECs were stably
  infected either with GFP (green fluorescence protein) linked lentiviral (LV) Sh-control
  or GFP-linked LV Sh Bmal1 as described materials and Methods section. Genomic DNA
  isolated from LV Shcontrol and LV ShBmal1 SRA-hLECs were cross-linked to immobilize
  bound protein in vivo, was sheared and immunoprecipitated with anti-Bmal1 or control
  IgG. Immunoprecipitated DNA was amplified using PCR with specific primers. 10% chromatin
  was used as input DNA. Amplified DNA band visualized with ethidium bromide staining
  as shown in photographic images.
