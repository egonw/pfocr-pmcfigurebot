figure_title: Intercellular communication between macrophages and epithelial cells
  via the SPP1 signaling pathway
caption: (A-B) Chord diagrams and bar graphs showing the interaction scores of various
  cell types in cancer predicted by the SPP1 signaling pathway. (C) Contribution of
  different receptor-ligand pairs of the SPP1 signaling pathway. (D) Expression of
  receptor-ligands in the SPP1 signaling pathway in different cell types. (E) Chordal
  graph showing interaction scores in different cell types via SPP1-CD44 receptor-ligand
  pairs. (F) Normalized enrichment score (NES) of different pathways in various cancers.
  (G) SPP1 levels in MDA-MB 231 (231)-induced TAM with SPP1 overexpression were detected
  by Western blot. (H) 231 cells were treated for 48 h with condition media from 231-induced
  TAM with SPP1 overexpression, or condition media (with SPP1 antibody or without)
  from 231-induced TAM. SOX2, CMYC, NANOG, OCT4 and PDL1 were detected by RT-qPCR.
  (I) 231 cells were treated for 48 h with condition media (with SPP1 antibody or
  without) from 231-induced TAM. The indicated proteins were detected by Western blot.
  Data were shown as mean Â± SD and are representative of three independent experiments.
  P values were calculated using the 2-tailed 2-sample t test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001.
