caption: Volcano map of differential metabolites and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
  based on the LC–MS metabolomics assay. A The volcano map displayed 122 up-regulated
  metabolites and 245 down-regulated metabolites in SBI-115-treated-group when compared
  with the DMSO-treated group. The blue and red dots represented the significantly
  down-regulated and up-regulated metabolites in SBI-115-treated-group, respectively;
  B The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was expressed as a bubble diagram. The size
  of the each bubble indicated the number of metabolites. The color of bubbles represented
  different P values. KEGG Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, LC–MS liquid chromatography–mass
