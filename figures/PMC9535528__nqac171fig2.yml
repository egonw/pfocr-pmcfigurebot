caption: Fate of dietary Trp and regulation of the kynurenine (Kyn)–NAD pathway. Trp
  can become limiting for protein synthesis if the oxidation pathway is accelerated,
  which in turn affects growth. Kyn plasma concentration increases when Trp oxidation
  exceeds renal handling. Niacin accumulation inhibits the pathway in a negative feedback
  fashion, whereas the need for more (for example, dietary deficiency), drives Trp
  down the oxidative pathway. Enzymes, gray-shaded boxes; ↑, upregulates the enzyme;
  ↓, downregulates the enzyme. IDO, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase; Kyn, kynurenine;
  Leu, leucine; PA, picolinic acid; QA, quinolinic acid; TDO, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase;
  TGF, transforming growth factor; Trp, tryptophan; 3-HAA,  3-hydroxy anthranilic
  acid.
