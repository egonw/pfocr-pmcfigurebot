caption: Enriched oncogenic signalling pathways in breast NETs, invasive ductal carcinomas
  (IDCs) and pancreatic NETs (PNETs). The bar plots on the left side in panels (A–C)
  show the number of mutated genes in the pathway in each of the cohorts, and the
  bar plots on the right side in panels (A–C) show the fractions of samples having
  mutated genes in the pathway. Oncoplot panels (D–F) visualise the pathogenetic or
  unknown variants of RTK-RAS, PI3K and NOTCH pathways in breast NETs. Tumour suppressor
  genes are in red font and oncogenes are in blue font in panels D–F. As the main
  results, the most enriched oncogenic pathways in breast NET were PI3K and RTK-RAS.
  A very frequent TP53 pathway enrichment in IDCs was only rarely observed in breast
  NETs. In PNET cohort, none of the oncogenic pathway was prominently affected over
  others.
