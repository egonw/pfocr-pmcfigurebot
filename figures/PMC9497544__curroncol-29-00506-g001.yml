caption: The therapeutic pathway of advanced disease in metastatic gastric cancer
  should derive from the evaluation of factors related both to patient (age, PS, comorbidities),
  and disease-related factors (stageâ€”locally advanced vs. metastatic, presence or
  absence of symptoms and disease burden) as well as factors related to the therapy
  itself (type of drugs used in the first line with the related toxicities).
