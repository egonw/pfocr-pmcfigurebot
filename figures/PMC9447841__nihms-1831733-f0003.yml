caption: Effects of SFN on the autophagy flux in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. (A) Western blotting
  of LC3 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were treated with 10 μM
  SFN with or without 100 nM Bafilomycin (BAF), or 0.1% DMSO (Control) for 6 h. β-actin
  was used as an internal control. (B) Schematic illustration of the tandem mCherry-EGFP-LC3
  plasmid. (C) Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells stably expressing mCherry-EGFP-LC3 were
  treated with 10 μM SFN, 100 nM Bafilomycin (BAF), or 0.1% DMSO for 3 h. Scale bar=50
  μm. (D) Schematic illustration of the measurement of autophagic flux with a GFP-LC3-RFP-ΔG
  probe. (E) Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells stably expressing GFP-LC3-RFP-ΔG were treated
  with SFN (10 μM) or 0.1% DMSO (Control) for 3 h. GFP/RFP ratio data were expressed
  as the fold-value against controls. Scale bar=50 μm. Values are the mean±S.E.M.
  (n=4). *P<.05, **P<.01 (one-way ANOVA with a Student-Newman post hoc test).
