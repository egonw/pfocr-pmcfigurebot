figure_title: White matter pathway fiber density affects amygdala TMS evoked responses
caption: (A) Across all participants, higher vlPFC–amygdala white matter pathway fiber
  density was associated with greater absolute valued TMS evoked response (TMS ER)
  magnitude in the left amygdala. Dark purple circles represent participants that
  exhibited a negative TMS ER; lighter purple circles represent those that exhibited
  a positive TMS ER. (B) Higher vlPFC–amygdala pathway fiber density was associated
  with a greater decrease in BOLD signal in individuals that exhibited a negative
  TMS ER (dark purple) and a greater increase in BOLD signal in individuals that exhibited
  a positive TMS ER (light purple). (C) In addition to the primary spTMS/fMRI scan
  during which TMS was applied to amygdala-targeting sites near the vlPFC, each participant
  received an additional spTMS/fMRI scan during which TMS pulses were applied to a
  secondary active site used in a pathway control analysis. The intensity-weighted
  center of gravity of all personalized stimulation sites is shown for vlPFC sites
  (purple) and active control sites (green). (D) The strength of the association (rho)
  between vlPFC–amygdala pathway fiber density and left amygdala TMS ER magnitude
  was substantially smaller when TMS was applied to active control sites located distant
  from pathway end points.
