caption: Curcumin reprogrammed M2 macrophages towards M1 macrophages by suppressing
  MAO-A/STAT6 signaling. Raw264.7 cells were pretreated with IL-4 (20 ng/mL) for 24
  h and then stimulated by curcumin (20 µM). (A). The expression of MAO-A was measured
  by qRT-PCR. (B–E). Western blot analyses of MAO-A and STAT6 signaling in macrophages
  treated with or without curcumin. (F). Flow cytometric analysis of ROS level in
  Raw264.7 cells. Data are presented as the mean ± SD (n = 3). p values were determined
  by Student’s t-tests or analysis of variance (ANOVA). * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; ***
  p < 0.001.
