caption: (A) MHC class I modulation. Flow cytometry analysis of MG-63 cells cultivated
  for 72 h on T or Z discs and then stimulated with IFN-α or IFN-γ for 48 h. The MG-63
  cells express high amounts of MHC class I (grey histograms), after stimulation with
  IFN-γ the overexpression of MHC class I was observed in the MG-63 cells (on Z disc—blue
  histogram; on T discs—green; in a sample without discs—red histogram). Stimulation
  with IFN-α did not change the MHC class I expression (orange histograms). The black
  dotted histograms represent isotype-matched negative controls. (B) MHC class II
  modulation. Flow cytometry analysis of MG-63 cells cultivated for 72 h on Z or T
  discs and then stimulated with IFN-α and IFN-γ for 48 h. The expression of MHC class
  II was analyzed. After stimulation with IFN-γ the MG-63 cells overexpressed MHC
  class II proteins (on Z disc—blue histogram; on T discs—green; without discs—red
  histogram). Stimulation with IFN-α did not influence the MHC class II expression
  (orange histograms), which overlap with the histograms of unstimulated cells (grey
  histograms) and with histograms of isotype control (black dotted histograms).
