figure_title: Raising and lessening propionyl-CoA in vitro with medium interventions
caption: 'a, Calibration experiment to titrate the amount of exogenous propionate
  needed produce a rise in propionyl-CoA in the range found in PA hearts. Forty-eight-hour
  treatment of NRVMs with up to 6 mM sodium propionate. Measurements of acyl-CoAs
  in NRVM lysates (n = 6 biologically independent samples from six isolations; left
  axis) were compared to measurements in PA and WT mice (right axis). Mathematical
  minimisation procedure best-fitted calibration constants to indicate that ∼1 mM
  propionate produces a rise in propionyl-CoA within the range of PA mice (red dots).
  Mean ± s.e.m. b, 13C tracing experiment in NRVMs with raised propionyl-CoA (exogenous
  propionate treatment) and for raised β-alanine (histidine in medium replaced with
  carnosine; yellow banding). Table shows the four treatment conditions (A/B/C/D).
  For conditions A/B, Ile and Val were uniformly labeled (13C on all carbons). For
  conditions C/D, 1 mM labeled propionate (13C at carbon-1) was added to the medium.
  Condition C/D produced a rise in propionate. n = 7 biologically independent samples
  per condition from seven isolations. Mean ± s.e.m. */** P < 0.05/<0.01. c, IC–MS
  identifies Krebs cycle intermediates. MeCit/Cit, 2-methylcitrate/citrate ratio.
  */** P < 0.05/<0.01. Mean ± s.e.m. d, 13C tracing of Ile/Val carbons (conditions
  A/B) or propionate carbon-1 (conditions C/D), expressed as percent molar enrichment.
  n = 7 per condition from seven isolations. Key shows number of 13C-labeled atoms.
  e, Acyl-CoA measurements expressed either as absolute quantification calibrated
  against standard curves or as relative AUC (without standards). n = 7 biologically
  independent samples per condition from seven isolations. */** P < 0.05/<0.01 for
  effect of propionate treatment. #/##P < 0.05/<0.01 for effect of raising β-alanine.
  Statistical testing by repeated-measures two-way ANOVA. Mean ± s.e.m. f, Summary
  of findings. Brown-filled symbols indicate carbons of acetyl-CoA or propionyl-CoA
  competing for entry into the Krebs cycle as citrate or 2-methylcitrate. Raising
  β-alanine favors the former. Propionate also enters the Krebs cycle as succinyl-CoA,
  but this pathway is not normally available in PA due to PCC inactivation. 2M2PE-CoA,
  trans-2-methyl-pentenoyl-CoA; 2M3HB-CoA, 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA; BH(I)B-CoA,
  β-hydroxy(iso)butyryl-CoA; Ile, isoleucine; MM-CoA, methylmalonyl-CoA; Val, valine.'
