caption: Activation of CXCR2/IFN-g/p38 MAPK/NF-κB signaling by tumor-associated macrophages
  (TAMs) was followed by increased cell proliferation and migration in hepatocellular
  carcinoma (HCC). (A) Schematic of experimental coculture methods for HCC and macrophages.
  (B) Huh7 cells cocultured with TAMs exhibited enhanced proliferation, which was
  reversed by the addition of TAMs transfected with si-CXCL6 or si-CXCR2. (C) Cell
  migration was also enhanced in cocultured TAM cells but suppressed in cells treated
  with si-CXCR2 or si-CXCL6. (D) Protein expression observed using the Western blot
  technique demonstrated that CXCL6/CXCR2 inhibition affected the expression of the
  IFN-g/p38 MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway. (E) CXCL6 agonist addition increased the
  expression of signaling pathway. ***, p < 0.001, control vs. treatment.
