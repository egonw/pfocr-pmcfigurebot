caption: CBX7 was down-regulated, while Twist1 and EphA2 were increased in BLBC. (A)
  IHC examined CBX7, Twist1 and EphA2 expression in BLBC tissues and adjacent normal
  breast tissues. Scar bar = 50 µm. (B) The levels of CBX7, Twist1 and EphA2 in BLBC
  tissues (n = 10) and adjacent normal breast tissues (n = 10) were determined by
  Western blot. (C) Chi-square test was used to detect the correlation between CBX7,
  Twist1, EphA2 expression and clinicopathological characteristics of BLBC patients.
  (D) Pearson analysis showed the correlation between the expression of CBX7 and EphA2,
  Twist1 and EphA2 in BLBC tissues. (E) The levels of CBX7, Twist1 and EphA2 in five
  breast cancer cell lines and breast epithelial cells were determined by Western
  blot. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.
