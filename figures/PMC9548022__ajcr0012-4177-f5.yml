caption: ICOSL promoted tumor progression by phosphorylating p38 in vitro. (A, B)
  Phosphokinase array experiments. The results showed that CD4+ T cells cocultured
  with MDA-MB-231 ICOSL-OE cells could change 12 protein kinase phosphorylation levels,
  especially p38 (T180/Y182), p53 (S392), p53 (S46), and CREB (S133), which are all
  in the p38-MAPK pathway. (C) The protein expression levels of p38 and p-p38 were
  detected by western blotting. The intracellular p38 phosphorylation level in MDA-MB-231
  ICOSL-OE cells was increased significantly when rhICOS-Fc was used. The intracellular
  p38 phosphorylation level decreased when SB202190 was added (**, P<0.05). (D-J)
  The proliferation (D), proportion of tumor cells in the proliferation cycle (G,
  H) and migration (I, J) were significantly promoted (**, P<0.05). In contrast, tumor
  cell apoptosis (E, F) decreased significantly when ICOS was provided via ICOS fusion
  protein (**, P<0.05). The above processes were significantly inhibited by the addition
  of the p38 inhibitor SB202190 (D-J, **, P<0.05). All of the above experiments were
  repeated three times.
