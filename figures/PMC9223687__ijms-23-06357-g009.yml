caption: The expression of polysaccharide-related genes and starch synthesis pathway.
  (a) The heat plot of differential expressed polysaccharide-related genes. (b) The
  starch synthesis pathway. The downregulated genes were shown in blue colors, amylose
  in red showed increased content, and amylopectin in blue showed decreased content.
