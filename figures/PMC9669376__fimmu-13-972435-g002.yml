caption: Experimental humanized immune system mice (NSG mice reconstituted with hematopoietic
  stem cells (HSCs); CD34+ cells repopulating the human immune effectors and referred
  to as HIS mice). Arthritis induced by collagen treatment (collagen-induced arthritis;
  CIA) in HIS mice (CIA-HIS) to study the role of combined therapy in the modulation
  of arthritis-induced inflammation. (A) CIA-HIS mice may be adoptively transferred
  with NKB cells followed by aceclofenac- and methotrexate-based combination therapy
  (co-therapy) to assess the immunoregulatory (Th1) phenotype in immune cells, allowing
  the progression of RA to be determined, and (B) co-therapy treatment in CIA-HIS
  mice followed by adoptive transfer of NKB cells. (C) CD40-mediated and NF-κB-controlled
  downstream effectors of the PI3K-Akt pathway (Akt1) and pro-apoptotic protein (Bim)
  induction during the signaling pathway to drive programmed death in pathogenic effector
  RA cells.
