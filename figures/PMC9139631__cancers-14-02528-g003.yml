caption: 'diTFPP mediated ER stress upon cotreatment with 20 Î¼M C2-ceramide for 24
  h. (A) GSEA of C2-ceramide-treated cells compared with diTFPP/C2-ceramide-treated
  cells indicated that ER stress response genes were upregulated in the diTFPP/C2-ceramide
  treatment group. (B) Western blot analysis of three major ER stress pathway markers.
  PreMW: prestained protein molecular weight marker (see ).'
