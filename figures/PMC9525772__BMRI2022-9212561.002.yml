caption: Enrichment of GO and KEGG pathways for candidate targets of TJZYF against
  decreased endometrial receptivity. (a) Intersection gene GO biological process,
  (b) cellular component, and (c) molecular function bubble plot. The y-axis on the
  left indicates GO pathway terms, and the x-axis indicates P values. The circle indicates
  the number of genes aligned in the pathways, a larger circle with a large number.
  The color from green to red indicates a greater ratio of genes aligned to pathways.
  (d) KEGG circle map. The outer right circle indicates terms of signaling pathways,
  and the left indicates genes. The inner left circle represents P values of genes
  with significance corresponding to the pathways.
