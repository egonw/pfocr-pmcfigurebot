caption: 'Molecular pathways of apoptosis regulate by LA. (A) LA triggers mitochondrial
  pathway through inhibition of survival pathways, for example (1) downregulation
  of ERK1/2 by PPARγ, and (2) Akt/GSK-3β inhibition by PTEN activation. Moreover,
  (3) LA causes oxidative stress by massive ROS accumulation and GSH decrease. Likewise,
  (4) LA generates accumulation of intracellular Ca2+, and expression of the UPR-associated
  genes (CHOP, GRP78, and GRP94), (5) downregulation of the PGE2 production and telomerase
  activity through suppressing COX-2 and hTERT expression. (6) All these events cause
  loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, increase in the Bax and Bad expression,
  and downregulate expression of Bcl-2, producing MOMP and promote the release of
  cytochrome c from the mitochondria, causing activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3,
  and decreasing ATP level. (7) Additionally, other studies demonstrated the upregulation
  of p21 and p53 mRNA. (B) (8) Regarding extrinsic pathway LA increases FAS and caspase-8
  levels. LA: Linoleic Acid. ERK1/2: Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases
  1 and 2. PPARγ: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma. Akt: Protein kinase
  B. GSK-3β: Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 Beta. PTEN: Phosphatase and tensin homolog.
  ROS: Reactive oxygen species. GSH: Glutathione. UPR: Unfolded protein response.
  CHOP: C/EBP Homologous Protein. GRP78: Glucose-Regulated Protein 78. GRP94: Glucose-Regulated
  Protein 94. PGE2: Prostaglandin E2. COX-2: Cyclooxygenase 2. hTERT: Telomerase reverse
  transcriptase. Bax: Bcl-2 Associated X-protein. Bad: Bcl-2 associated agonist of
  cell death. Bcl-2: B-cell lymphoma 2. MOMP: Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization.
  ATP: Adenosine triphosphate. p21: Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A. p53: Tumor
  protein P53. FAS: Fas cell surface death receptor.'
