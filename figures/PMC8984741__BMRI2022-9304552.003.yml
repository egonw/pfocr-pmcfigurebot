caption: Developing a compound-target network for gypenosides. (a) Venn diagram revealing
  the overlapping target genes for gypenosides and bladder cancer. (b) PPI network
  of antibladder cancer-associated proteins. Bigger node sizes and darker red colors
  indicate a higher degree of association. (c) Gene ontology (GO) functional annotation
  of potential targets of gypenosides. Cellular components (CC), biological processes
  (BP), and molecular functions (MF) were analyzed. (d) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
  and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis for potential signaling pathways of gypenosides.
  The top 20 pathways with lower P-values are visualized.
