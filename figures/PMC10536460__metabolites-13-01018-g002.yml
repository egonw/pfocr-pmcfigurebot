caption: KEGG enrichment analysis plot. (A) KEGG Enrichment Analysis (YZ6C_vs_YZ6U),
  (B) KEGG Enrichment Analysis (YZ1C_vs_YZ1U). The x−axis represents the significance
  p value of enrichment, where a smaller p value indicates greater statistical significance.
  Typically, a p value below 0.05 is considered significantly enriched for a particular
  function. The y−axis represents KEGG pathways. The size of the bubbles in the plot
  indicates the number of enriched compounds within the metabolic set for that pathway.
  YZN1U, YZN1 uncooked; YZN1C, YZN1 cooked; YZ6U, YZ6 uncooked; YZ6C, YZ6 cooked.
