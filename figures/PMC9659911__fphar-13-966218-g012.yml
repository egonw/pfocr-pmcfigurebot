caption: Comprehensive analysis of metabolic pathways. (A,B) are Pathway analysis.
  Each bubble in the bubble map represents a metabolic pathway, where the Y-axis and
  bubble size represent the impact factor of this pathway in the topology analysis,
  and the X-axis and bubble color represent the p-value of enrichment analysis. (A)
  is CRS vs. Control. (B) is CRS + YSDZ vs. CRS. (C) Representative metabolic pathways
  found in metabolomics analysis. (D) Key metabolite-Target-Enzyme-Reaction-Compound-Gene
  networks.
