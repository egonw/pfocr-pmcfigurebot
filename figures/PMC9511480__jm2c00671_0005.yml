caption: 'Nilotinib inhibits p38αMAPK-MK2/MK3 signaling axis. (A) MALDI-TOF MS relative
  quantitation of the ratio m/z 4964/4632 in THP-1 cells pre-treated with DMSO, 5
  μM nilotinib, imatinib, 1 μM losmapimod, or 1 μM MRT68601 for 1 h before stimulation
  with live E. coli for up to 24 h. (B) Western blot analysis of the p38α MAPK pathway
  in THP-1 cells pre-treated with DMSO, 5 μM nilotinib, 5 μM imatinib, 1 μM losmapimod,
  or 1 μM MRT68601 for 1 h before stimulation with live E. coli for up to 15 min shows
  loss of p38 phosphorylation in response to nilotinib. Nilotinib and losmapimod,
  but not imatinib, block phosphorylation of the downstream MK2. α-Tubulin serves
  as a loading control. A representative image with two biological replicates of four
  replicates is shown. Relative mobilities of reference proteins (masses in kDa) are
  shown on the left of each blot. Relative quantification is shown in Figure S6C.
  (C) TNF-α, (D) IL-6, and (E) IL-1β secretion was measured by ELISA at 24 h. The
  statistical significance of the comparisons with E. coli is indicated as follows:
  ns, not significant; **, P ≤ 0.01; ***, P ≤ 0.001. (F) TNF-α and (G) IL-6 expressions
  were determined by RT-qPCR in nontransfected or transfected HEK293 cells with p38α
  WT or p38α M107T for 48 h and pre-treated with DMSO, 5 μM nilotinib, or imatinib
  for 1 h before stimulation with LPS for up to 24 h. The results were analyzed using
  the 2-ΔΔCt method and normalized using GAPDH and TBP as the reference genes and
  nontransfected DMSO sample as the reference sample. Statistical significance of
  the comparisons: LPS nontransfected is indicated as ‡; LPS transfected with p38α
  WT is indicated as †; LPS transfected with p38α T106M is indicated as $. Error bars
  represent the standard deviation of four biological replicates. The statistical
  significance of the comparisons between p38α WT and p38α M107T is indicated as follows:
  ns, not significant; **, P ≤ 0.01. Significant differences between two groups were
  determined by the Mann–Whitney U-test.'
