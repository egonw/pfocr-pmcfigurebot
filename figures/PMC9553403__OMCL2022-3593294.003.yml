caption: 'Surgery induced hippocampus ferroptosis in aged mice. The mice were randomly
  divided into 3 groups: Sham group, dNCR group, and dNCR+Fer-1 group. (a) TEM was
  employed to detect the ultrastructure of hippocampus in aged mice (bar = 1.0 μm).
  (b, c) ROS (red fluorescent signal) were detected using DHE staining (bar = 100 μm).
  (d) The GSH level by GSH Colorimetric Assay Kit. (e) The MDA level by MDA Colorimetric
  Assay Kit. (f) The Fe2+ level by Ferrous Iron Colorimetric Assay Kit. (g–j) GPX4,
  P53, and SLC7A11 expressions in each group were determined by Western blot. gprot:
  gram protein; mgprot: milligram protein. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM (n = 5/group).
  ∗∗P < 0.01 and ∗∗∗P < 0.001, Sham vs. dNCR; @@P < 0.01 and @@@P < 0.001, dNCR vs.
  dNCR+Fer-1. Fer-1: ferrostatin-1, a ferroptosis inhibitor.'
