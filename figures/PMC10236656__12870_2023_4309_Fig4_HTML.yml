caption: Analysis of genes related to citrate metabolism in the intersection genes
  between the 825 continually DEGs and the turquoise and brown modules. A Citrate
  metabolism pathway. The red font indicates the genes obtained in the intersection
  genes. B Heatmap of the expression levels of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
  involved in citrate metabolism. C qRT-PCR detection of citrate metabolism related
  structural genes, PH8 (Cs1g16150), PEPCK1 (Cs3g16700) and PEPCK2 (Cs1g20920). D
  Correlation analysis of the expression profiles in qRT-PCR (qPCR) and transcriptome
  data (FPKM) (*, ** and *** represent significant differences at p < 0.05, p < 0.01
  and p < 0.001, respectively between the two sets of data)
article_title: Weighted gene coexpression correlation network analysis reveals the
  potential molecular regulatory mechanism of citrate and anthocyanin accumulation
  between postharvest ‘Bingtangcheng’ and ‘Tarocco’ blood orange fruit.
