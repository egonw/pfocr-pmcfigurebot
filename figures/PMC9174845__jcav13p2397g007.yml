caption: ADAR1 coupled with DHX9 regulate R-Loop accumulation. (A) The interaction
  between ADAR1 and DHX9 was detected by co-immunoprecipitation. (B) The interaction
  between protein and RNA/DNA was detected by DRIP. (C) Cell growth curve of SKOV3
  with scramble shRNA and SKOV3 and ADAR1shRNA. SKOV3 with ADAR1 shRNA were transfected
  with DHX9 siRNA or not. (D) Phosphorylation of Chk1 and H2A.X were detected via
  Western blot in ADAR1 knockdown cells. ADAR1 knockdown cells were transfected with
  DHX9 siRNA or not.
