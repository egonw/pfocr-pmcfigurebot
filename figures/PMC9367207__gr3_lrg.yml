caption: Proposed mechanisms by which α7nAChR agonists protect patients from hyperoxia-induced
  neurocognitive dysfunction and compromised innate immunity by activating the cholinergic
  anti-inflammatory pathway. Under normoxic conditions, lung inflammation in response
  to infections or injuries in healthy subjects is at least partially modulated by
  the activation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAIP). The CAIP aids
  in the homeostatic maintenance of lung and brain inflammation, which influences
  healthy lung and cognitive functions. Under hyperoxic conditions and as a consequence
  of aging and neurodegenerative diseases, increased levels of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) can impair macrophage functions in the lung and the neurons in the brain.
  ROS-induced damage to the cells in the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral
  nervous system (PNS), and blood-brain barrier (BBB) can result in cognitive dysfunction,
  which can cause impairment of the CAIP. The compromised CAIP can establish a pathological
  inflammatory cycle, resulting in dysregulated hyperinflammatory responses in the
  lung and the development of the acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress
  syndrome (ARDS). Increased levels of ROS in the lung also activate NF-κB, which
  further increase the release of proinflammatory cytokines, exacerbating lung inflammation.
  Hyperinflammatory responses can then contribute to systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation
  and produce a further deterioration in cognitive function, thus establishing a vicious
  cycle of compromised neuro-immune modulation. α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
  (α7nAChR) agonists, such as GTS-21 or GAT107, help re-establish the homeostatic
  inflammatory balance. The activation of α7nAChR by GTS-21 or GAT107 can down-regulate
  the excessive production/secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (including HMGB1),
  which is correlated with the attenuation of hyperoxia-compromised innate immunity
  and neurocognitive function. Therefore, α7nAChR agonists may have a protective role
  in hyperoxia-induced neurocognitive dysfunction and inflammatory lung diseases.
