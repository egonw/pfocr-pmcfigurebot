caption: 'Effects of various miR-125 and/or Afa formulations on EGFR pathway in AGS
  cells. (A) Scheme of EGFR pathway. (B) (Left) Effect of various formulations of
  miR-125 (100 nM) and/or Afa (IC30: 300 nM) on expression of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway
  after treatment for 24 h on AGS cells. (Right) Quantification of relative protein
  levels of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. (C) (Left) Effect of various formulations of miR-125
  (100 nM) and/or Afa (IC30: 300 nM) on expression of Kras/Erk pathway after treatment
  for 24 h on AGS cells. (Right) Quantification of the relative protein levels of
  Kras/Erk pathway. (B,C) * p < 0.05 compared with control (CTR), † p < 0.05 compared
  with miR-125/SLN-KL, ‡ p < 0.05 compared with Afa, ¶ p < 0.05 compared with Afa/SLN,
  and § p < 0.05 compared with Afa/SLN-KL by using Student’s t-test analysis. (D)
  (Right) Migration assay after treatment of various formulations for 15 h. (Left)
  Quantification of relative percentages of cell-migration area. Migration area (%
  of area at 0 h) = 100% − (Blank area (15 h)/Blank area (0 h) × 100% (NS, not significant;
  statistical significance at ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001).'
