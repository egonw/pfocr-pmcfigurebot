caption: 'Effects of GSK3β knockdown on cardiac fibrosis induced by NET1 overexpression(A)
  Expression level of NET1 after overexpression NET1 and knockdown GSK3β in cardiac
  fibroblasts. n = 3, ∗∗p = 0.0022 NET1 vs. NC + siGSK3β, n = 3, by Kruskal-Wallis
  test.(B) Expression level of collagen I (n = 3, ∗∗p = 0.0022 NET1 vs. NC + siGSK3β)
  and hydroxyproline (n = 3, ∗p = 0.0415 NC vs. NET1, ∗∗p = 0.0022 NET1 vs. NC + siGSK3β,
  ∗p = 0.0415 NET1+ siGSK3β vs. NC + siGSK3β) after overexpression NET1 and knockdown
  GSK3β in cardiac fibroblasts.(C) Expression level of α-SMA after overexpression
  NET1 and knockdown GSK3β in cardiac fibroblasts. Scale bar: 20 μm, magnification,
  200×.(D) EdU staining was used to detect fibroblast proliferation, Scale bar: 20 μm,
  magnification, 200×. n = 3. ∗p = 0.0415 NC vs. NET1, ∗∗p = 0.0022 siGSK3β vs. NET1,
  ∗p = 0.0415 NET1 + siGSK3β vs. siGSK3β by Kruskal-Wallis test.(E) The migration
  of fibroblasts was detected by scratch experiment. n = 3, ∗p = 0.0134 siGSK3β vs.
  NET1 by Kruskal-Wallis test.(F) Expression level of β-catenin after overexpression
  NET1 and knockdown GSK3β in cardiac fibroblasts. n = 3, ∗p = 0.0280 NC vs. NET1,
  ∗∗p = 0.0029 NET1 vs. NC + siGSK3β, by Kruskal-Wallis test.(G) Expression level
  of GSK3β after overexpression NET1 and knockdown GSK3β in cardiac fibroblasts. n
  = 3, ∗p = 0.0174 siGSK3β vs. NET1, ∗∗p = 0.0066 NET1 + siGSK3β vs. NET1 by Kruskal-Wallis
  test. For all statistical plots, the data are presented as mean ± SEM.(H and I)
  Expression level of GSK3β-S389 (Green), GSK3β-S9 (Red) (I), and β-catenin after
  overexpression NET1 and knockdown GSK3β in cardiac fibroblasts. Scale bar: 20 μm,
  magnification, 200×.'
