caption: A In traditional mosaic analysis, homozygous mutant cells were identified
  as unstained cells if the marker gene was trans-placed into the mutant gene at the
  distal end of the FRT site on the homologous chromosome arm. B In the MARCM system,
  the transgene encoding the suppressor of gene expression is placed at the distal
  end of the FRT site on the homologous chromosome arm of the mutant gene. Only in
  homozygous mutant cells can the marker genes be expressed due to the deletion of
  suppressor genes. C UAS (Upstream Activation Sequence), is a sequence to which GAL4
  (a transcriptional activator placed next to the desired tissue promoter) binds to
  drive gene expression in a specific tissue. Moreover, gene knockdown/silencing is
  achieved using UAS-RNAi flies, resulting in hairpin expression and RNAi-mediated
  gene knockdown in a tissue-specific manner. D CRISPR/Cas9 is a complex composed
  of Cas9 protein with endonuclease activity and specific sgRNA (single guide RNA).
  SgRNA first recognizes the particular sequence in the genes causing a series of
  changes that make itself and the target DNA pair with each other and form a heteroduplex
  of RNA-DNA. At the same time, sgRNA and Cas9 nuclease form a complex that binds
  to the target sequence, cleaves, and produces double-strand breaks. This breakage
  can induce DNA's response to damage and stimulate DNA repair through various endogenous
  mechanisms, thus editing the genes.
