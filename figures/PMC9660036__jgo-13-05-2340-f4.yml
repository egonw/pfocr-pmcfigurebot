caption: 'P53 overexpression attenuates the function of nestin on CRC proliferation.
  (A) The expression levels of nestin and p53, were detected by western blot assay;
  (B) the viability of Caco-2 and RKO cells transfected with nestin, nestin + p53,
  or vector was measured through CCK-8 assay; (C) the proliferations of Caco-2 and
  RKO cells were evaluated by EdU staining; (D) Western blot assay shows the protein
  expressions of cleaved-caspase 3 in Caco-2 and RKO cells. **, P<0.01 vs. Blank;
  ***, P<0.001 vs. vector; ###, P<0.001 vs. nestin. n=3. CRC, colorectal cancer; OD,
  optical density; EdU, 5-ethynyl-2''-deoxyuridine.'
article_title: Nestin protein affects the maintenance of stem characteristics of colorectal
  cancer cells based on p53 dependent pathway.
