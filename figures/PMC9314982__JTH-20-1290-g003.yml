caption: Signaling and interactions of TF and TFPI. TFPIα binds coreceptors that support
  its cell‐surface functions. Binding to GPI‐anchored glycosaminoglycan receptors
  (e.g., glypicans) via the K3 domain mediates membrane association. GPI‐anchored
  TFPIα or TFPIβ can translocate to sphingolipid‐rich raft domains and caveolae. Binding
  to receptors involved in internalization and degradation of FXa (e.g., lipoprotein
  receptor related protein 1 and VLDLR) can modulate cellular responses to various
  stimuli. TFPIβ is a GPI anchored via its C‐terminal domain and appears to regulate
  cell‐intrinsic functions of TF, such as immune signaling of FXa in complex with
  TF‐FVIIa via protease activated receptor (PAR) 2 in the presence of the endothelial
  protein C receptor (EPCR) or signaling of the TF‐FVIIa associated with integrin
  receptors via PAR2 after endosomal uptake. a, active; C, carboxy; F, factor; GPI,
