caption: SIAIS361034 inhibits the Hh signaling pathway by disabling pro-survival Bcl-2
  family proteins/Sufu interactions. (A, B) A representative western blot analysis
  of Gli1, Bcl-xL, and Sufu expression in light II cells pretreated with or without
  MG132 (1 µM) or Pomalidomide (10 µM) for 2 h, followed by treatment with or without
  SIAIS361034 (1 µM) and JQ1 (1 µM). (C) Dual-luciferase reporter analysis of the
  activity of SIAIS361034 against the Hh activity in light II cells exposed to SAG
  (100 nM) pretreated with or without MG132 (1 µM) or Pomalidomide (10 µM) for 2 h,
  followed by treatment with or without SIAIS361034 (1 µM) and JQ1 (1 µM). Data represent
  mean ± SD (n = 3). (D) A representative western blot analysis of Gli1 after immunoprecipitation
  with Sufu in NIH-3T3 cells pretreated with or without MG132 (1 µM) for 2 h, followed
  by treatment with or without SIAIS361034 (1 µM) and whole-cell lysates (Input) are
  shown from a single experiment. (E) Representative IF staining of Gli1 in 293T cells
  that were transfected with Gli1 and then were treated with or without SIAIS361034
  (1 µM) and MG132 (1 µM) as indicated for 24 h. (F) Model of SIAIS361034 antagonizing
  Gli1 through degradation of Bcl-xL. This model image was created in BioRender.com.
  GAPDH was used as protein loading control in western blot analysis shown in A, B,
  and D.
