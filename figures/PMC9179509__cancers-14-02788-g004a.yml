  functions of ZNF582-AS1 based on its expression and methylation signatures. (A)
  IPA prediction of the molecular and cellular functions related to the ZNF582-AS1
  expression signature. (B) IPA prediction of the molecular and cellular functions
  related to the ZNF582-AS1 promoter methylation signature. (C) IPA prediction of
  the signal network related to the ZNF582-AS1 expression signature. (D) IPA prediction
  of the signal network related to the ZNF582-AS1 promoter methylation signature.
