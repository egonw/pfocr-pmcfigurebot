caption: Molecular changes in retinal organoids at the juncture of retinal cell specification.
  (A) Genomic tracks for individual day 45 organoids at the TSS of SIX6 and VSX2 (left)
  and the corresponding RNA-seq values of day 35 and 45 (right). (B) Flow cytometry
  was performed at days 15 and 45 for GFP and tdTomato. No tdTomato+ cells were detected
  at day 15, and at day 45 all tdTomato+ cells additionally were GFP+. (C) qRT-PCR
  for SIX6 and VSX2 mRNA expression at day 45 was performed. (D) Genomic tracks (left)
  and mRNA expression (right) of bipolar cell genes. (E) Genomic region upstream of
  VSX2 from day 45 ATAC-seq samples. The location of published core regulatory circuit
  super enhancer (CRC-SE, Diri et al.) are indicated by black arrows and the location
  of proximal promoter elements (Kim et al., arrowhead) are indicated by white arrowheads.
  (F) A scatter plot showing corresponding values from RNA-seq of VSX2 and the upstream
  gene LIN52 (right). (G) Genomic tracks (left) and mRNA expression line graphs (right)
  of characteristic photoreceptor markers. (H) Genomic tracks (left) and corresponding
  mRNA expression line graphs (right) for retinal progenitor cell markers. (I) Genomic
  tracks (left) and mRNA expression line graphs (right) from day 45 samples for stem
  cell markers. (J) A bar graph showing the number of genes involved in each pathway
  and a line graph depicting the –log(Benjamini-Hochberg) for the 10 statistically
  significant pathways (−log(Benjamini-Hochberg) > 3) as determined by DAVID (). (K)
  “Visual perception” was the most highly significant pathway and was further classified
  into phototransduction, functional, and structural genes and heatmaps were generated.
  Scale for all genomic tracks = 0–100.
