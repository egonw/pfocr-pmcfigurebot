caption: 'Comparison of prednisone-responsive genes associated with (A) autoantigen,
  (B) MHC class II antigen presentation, (C) B-cell receptor signaling, and (D) Fc
  receptors and phagocytosis pathways in lung or kidney tissues 14 weeks post instillation
  with cSiO2. Gene expression data were obtained using the NanoString Autoimmune Profiling
  gene panel and are shown as log2 ratios for cSiO2/P0, cSiO2/PL, and cSiO2/PM treatment
  groups with respect to the tissue-matched VEH/P0 control group (log2 ratio = 0).
  For each pathway, heatmaps with unsupervised hierarchical clustering (Euclidian
  distance method) by gene show log2 expression values for all genes identified as
  differentially expressed in response to either cSiO2 exposure or moderate-dose prednisone
  (FDR q<0.05, 1.5-fold change) in either of the selected tissues. The mean log2 ratio
  values + SEM for selected genes of interest are also shown for each pathway. For
  for cSiO2/P0 as compared to VEH/P0, *, FDR-corrected q<0.05; **, q<0.01; and ***,
  q<0.001. For cSiO2/PL or cSiO2/PM vs cSiO2/P0, #, FDR-corrected q<0.05; and ##,
  q<0.01. nd stands for not detected. See  for test specifications and FDR-corrected
  q-values for all genes in the panel for all comparisons. cSiO2, crystalline silica;
  P0, zero prednisone; PL, low-dose prednisone; PM, moderate-dose prednisone; VEH,
  vehicle control.'
