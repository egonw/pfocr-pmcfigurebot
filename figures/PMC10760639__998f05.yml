caption: 'Identification of a steroid biosynthesis pathway that generates ADIOL, which
  promotes learning in both young and aged adults. (A) Dose–response relationship
  of varying concentrations of pregnenolone (PREG); dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA);
  5-androstene-3β, 17β-diol (ADIOL); progesterone (PROG); testosterone (T); 17β-estradiol
  (E2); and vehicle (DMSO) on pharyngeal pumping. Points represent the mean and whiskers
  represent the standard error of the mean of the pumping rates of 12–28 animals per
  dose. Statistical evaluation by ANOVA (Dunnett''s correction). (**) P < 0.01 compared
  with DMSO. (B) Pharyngeal pumping rates of wild-type (WT) and mutant animals treated
  with different steroids or with DMSO alone as a vehicle control. n = 15–32 animals
  per condition. The data were statistically evaluated by ANOVA (Holm''s correction).
  (C) Inferred metabolic organization of cyp-13A4 and F12E12.11. (D) KYNA levels from
  wild-type animals treated with ADIOL and DMSO as a control. The same data for DMSO
  were used in C. n = 5 independent biological samples per condition. Statistical
  evaluation by ANOVA (Holm''s correction). (E) Spontaneous Ca2+ transients recorded
  from RIM neurons expressing GCaMP in animals treated with DMSO or ADIOL and conditioned
  with butanone prior to imaging. Fifteen recordings of the change in fluorescence
  (ΔF/F) over 225 sec (s) per recording are shown. The summed intensity of each recording
  is plotted. Statistical evaluation by Wilcoxon rank-sum test. (F) Short-term learning
  performance for wild-type (WT) day 1 animals, kynurenine pathway mutants, and 5-d
  and 7-d aged animals treated with ADIOL or DMSO alone as a vehicle control. Statistical
  evaluation by ANOVA (Holm''s correction). (G) Overview of ADIOL quantification by
  multiple reaction monitoring LC-MS/MS. Acidified homogenates were spiked with ADIOL-D3
  as an internal standard and extracted into the nonpolar phase, and the residues
  from the nonpolar phase were subjected to solid-phase extraction using SiO2 cartridges.
  The residues from the eluates were esterified with nicotinic acid and subjected
  to UPLC-MS/MS. The mass transitions of doubly protonated ADIOL and ADIOL-D3 primary
  ions involving the loss of nicotinic acid after collision-induced dissociation (CID)
  were selected for analysis. (H) Representative chromatograms of the mass transitions
  monitored. (I) Quantification of endogenous ADIOL from wild-type animals treated
  with F17 or DMSO alone as a control. n = 3 independent biological replicates per
  condition. Statistical evaluation by two-tailed t-test. P-values in A–I are as follows:
  (*) P < 0.05, (***) P < 0.001, (****) P < 0.0001. (J) Pharmacogenetic–metabolic
  relationship of F17, nhr-131, cyp-13A4, F12E12.11, ADIOL, and KYNA with learning
  and pharyngeal pumping behaviors.'
