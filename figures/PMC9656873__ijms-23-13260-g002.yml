caption: Immune-to-brain communication. The perivascular space contains a single or
  double layer of invaginated pia in the brain, forming an interstitial fluid-filled
  space representing an extension of the extracellular fluid space around the intracranial
  vessels as they move down into the brain parenchyma. Human sensory stimuli affect
  the breathing sensation passing through the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus. The
  respiratory muscles are not purposely activated in healthy breathing. Neuropilin-1
  (a pleiotropic single-transmembrane coreceptor for class-3 semaphorins and vascular
  endothelial growth factors) has been confirmed as a coreceptor that facilitates
  SARS-CoV-2 infection into cells and may be expressed in the brainstem. Activated
  microglia were observed in the olfactory bulb, midbrain (particularly in the substantia
  nigra), hindbrain, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, and pre-Bötzinger complex
  in the medulla. Neuroinflammation with microgliosis and T-cell infiltration in COVID-19
  brains was significantly greater than that in patients who did not have COVID-19.
  This might trigger inflammasomes and pyroptosis in the CNS. The pre-Bötzinger complex
  involvement in the brainstem could account for the respiratory failure and sudden
  high death rate of COVID-19 ARDS patients. The neurovirulent potential of SARS-CoV-2
  is not restricted to patients with mild or severe diseases that can develop neurological
  complications. Microglia and astrocytes play specific and dynamic roles during immune
  activation. This immune-to-brain communication occurs when glia, microglia, and
  astrocytes interpret and propagate inflammatory signals in the brain, and influence
  physiological and behavioral-change responses. Activating the peripheral immune
  system with a coordinated brain response elicits and influences physiological and
  behavioral responses in the immunological memory engram pathway.
