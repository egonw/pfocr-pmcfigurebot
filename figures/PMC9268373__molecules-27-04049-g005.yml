caption: 'Effects of PAG, AOAA, and L-Asp on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in
  human BC cells. (a) The expression levels of p-PI3K, p-AKT, and p-mTOR were detected
  by Western blot. (b) Densitometric quantification was performed, normalized to the
  level of respective non-phosphorylated candidate protein. The experiments were performed
  in triplicate. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 compared
  with the control group; △ p < 0.05, △△ p < 0.01 compared with PAG group; ★ p < 0.05,
  ★★ p < 0.01 compared with AOAA group; ## p < 0.01 compared with L-Asp group.'
