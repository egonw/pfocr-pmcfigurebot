caption: Top 15 enriched canonical pathways identified in IPA by DEPs in (A) healthy
  and (B) diseased conditions. The pathways are indicated on the y-axis. On the x-axis,
  the enrichment score (âˆ’log10(p-value)) for each pathway is indicated by the bars.
  (C) Healthy top molecular network involving free radical scavenging, small molecule
  biochemistry and drug metabolism. (D) Disease top molecular network in conditions
  involving carbohydrate metabolism, nucleic acid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry.
  Upregulated proteins are represented in red and downregulated proteins are represented
  in green. Orange represents predicted activation, while blue represents predicted
  inhibition.
