caption: Nrf2 deficiency aggravates the liver injury induced by LPS stimulation after
  TP pretreatment. (a) Changes in the levels of ALT and AST in WT and Nrf2−/− mice
  treated with TP and LPS (n = 6). (b) Representative images of HE-stained liver from
  WT and Nrf2−/− mice treated with TP and LPS, 200x magnification. (c) RT-PCR analysis
  of hepatic M1 genes in WT and Nrf2−/− mice administrated with TP and LPS (n = 6).
  Data are presented as mean ± SEM, ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. WT-control.
