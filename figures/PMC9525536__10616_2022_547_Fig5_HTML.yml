caption: 'Effect of different kinase inhibitors on P3-induced differentiation. Cells
  treated with different kinase inhibitors 45 min before the addition of P3 fraction
  (20 µg/ml) were scored for NBT positive cells at 96 h post-treatment. Data represent
  the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. Statistical significance (p value)
  was calculated with respect to P3-treated HL-60 cells using Ordinary One-way ANOVA
  (Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test). #p ≤ 0.001'
article_title: Anti-leukemic principle(s) from Momordica charantia seeds induce differentiation
  of HL-60 cells through ERK/MAPK signalling pathway.
