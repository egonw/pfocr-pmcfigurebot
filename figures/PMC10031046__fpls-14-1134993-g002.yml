  Kaempferol; Q, Quercetin. leuco-Pel, Leucopelargonidin; leuco-Cya, Leucocyanidin.
  (B) SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified recombinant fusion proteins (C) Analysis of
  the enzyme reactions with the recombinant RcDFR fusion proteins in vitro. (D, E)
  Analysis of the reaction products obtained from the recombinant RcFLSs fusion proteins
  in vitro, using dihydroflavonols and flavanones as substrates, respectively. The
  enzyme reaction substrates are shown in red, and the products are shown in green.
