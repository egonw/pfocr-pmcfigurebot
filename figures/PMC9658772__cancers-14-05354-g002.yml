caption: 'The role of E3 ligases in the p53 pathway, the Nuclear Factor Kappa-B (NF-κB)
  pathway, the EGFR pathway, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, the TGF-β/Smad pathway in
  endometrial carcinoma (EC) and cervical cancer (CC). The p53 signaling pathway:
  E3 ligases murine double minute 2(MDM2), E6AP, and TRIM65 directly bind to p53 and
  promote ubiquitination degradation of p53. p53 protein, in turn, induces MDM2 to
  regulate itself through self-ubiquitination. Furthermore, RBBP6 promotes the phosphorylation
  of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) to regulate the expression of p53. In CC cells,
  FHL2 binds to IER3 and MDM2 to form a ternary complex that allows for efficient
  MDM2-mediated degradation of IER3 by enhancing the association between MDM2 and
  IER3. NF-κB pathway: E3 ligase TRIM22 directly binds to nucleotide-binding oligomerization
  domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2). Reducing the phosphorylation of p65 and IκBα
  reduces NF-κB signal transduction. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway:
  makorin RING finger protein 1 (MKRN1) can be phosphorylated by the EGFR/PI3K/AKT
  pathway to continuously degrade PTEN protein in a K48-dependent manner. Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway: RNF43 directly interacts with Wnt and promotes its degradation, thereby
  inhibiting continuous activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. TGF-β/Smad pathway:
  Activated TGF-β ligand interacts with two transmembrane receptors TβRI and TβRII,
  to form a tetrameric complex. Constitutively activated TβRII phosphorylates and
  activates TβRI, which directly phosphorylates downstream transcription factors Smad
  2 and Smad 3 through its serine/threonine kinase activity. Activated Smad2 or Smad3
  can bind to Smad4, migrate to the nucleus, and bind to different TFs to achieve
  excessive activator or suppressor activity. SCFSkp2/Cks1 directly interacts with
  p27 and ubiquitinate it.'
