caption: 'Nusinersen modulates amino acid and ketone body metabolism in the CSF of
  SMA2 patients. (A,D) PLS-DA score scatter plots showing the metabolomic profile
  of CSF from SMA2 patients before treatment (T0) and at loading (T1) (A) or maintenance
  (T2) (D) phases of Nusinersen administration. The clusters’ analyses are reported
  in the Cartesian space that is described by the main components, PC1: 12.5% and
  PC2: 12.3% (T0 vs. T1 clusters) (A) and PC1: 17.7% and PC2: 11.4% (T0 vs. T2 clusters)
  (D). PLS-DA was evaluated using cross validation (CV) analysis. CV tests performed
  according to PLS-DA statistical protocol show a significant separation between T0
  and T1 clusters (0.94 and 1.0 accuracy values for PC1 and PC2, respectively, with
  positive 0.58 and 0.83 Q2 indices) (A), and T0 and T2 clusters (0.57 and 0.71 accuracy
  values for PC1 and PC2, respectively, and 0.23 and 0.29 Q2 indices) (D). The data
  reveal that Nusinersen induces metabolic changes in the CSF of SMA2 patients at
  both loading and maintenance phases. (B,E) VIP score graphs of metabolites discriminating
  the CSF of SMA2 patients at T0 from that of the same patients at T1 (B) or T2 (E).
  Metabolites characterized by a VIP score > 1 are shown. (C,F) Diagram of the pathway
  enrichment analysis showing the effect of Nusinersen therapy on biochemical pathways
  associated with amino acid and ketone body metabolism in SMA2 patients at both T1
  (C) and T2 (F). The number of molecules (hits) related to the specific metabolic
  pathway is shown within each bar (see also ). (G) Hierarchical heat maps generated
  by MetaboAnalyst software are based on the Euclidean distance and Ward’s algorithm.
  The heatmaps are calculated based on the concentrations of discriminating metabolites
  with VIP > 1 in the CSF of SMA2 patients at T0, T1, and T2. For each metabolite,
  the bar color represents its abundance on a normalized scale from blue (low level)
  to red (high level). The dendrogram at the top is based on the similarity of the
  metabolomic profile relative to each sample cluster. The dendrogram on the left
  is based on the metabolite abundance profiles. The analysis highlights hierarchical
  separation of CSF metabolomic profiles at loading (T1) and maintenance (T2) phases
  from the baseline (T0). This confirms that Nusinersen administration induces changes
  in the metabolomic CSF profile of SMA2 patients.'
