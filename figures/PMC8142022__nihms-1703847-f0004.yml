figure_title: Metabolism and cell signaling in ferroptosis
caption: 'The figure depicts the regulation of ferroptosis by multiple metabolic events
  (such as lipogenesis, autophagy, and mitochondrial TCA cycle) and signaling pathways
  (such as E-cadherin-NF2-Hippo-YAP pathway, glucose-regulated AMPK signaling, and
  p53 and BAP1 tumor suppressor function). See text for detail. Abbreviations: TfR,
  transferrin receptor; PL-OOH, phospholipid hydroperoxide; PUFA-PL, phospholipid
  with polyunsaturated fatty acid chain; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TCA, mitochondrial
  TCA cycle; Gln, glutamine; Glu, glutamate; αKG, α-ketoglutarate.'
