caption: 'In MCAO mice, AKG therapy decreased inflammatory response and oxidative
  damage. (a–d) Representative blots of proinflammatory cytokines and quantitative
  analysis (n = 4). (e–g) The levels of proinflammatory cytokines were measured using
  ELISA (n = 5). (h and i) The levels of superoxide anions as determined by DHE staining
  are shown in representative photos and quantitative analysis (n = 5). Scale bar,
  100 μm. (j–l) SOD, MDA, and GSH levels were measured using SOD, MDA, and GSH kits
  (n = 5). ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 versus the sham group and #P < 0.05 and ##P <
  0.01 versus the MCAO group.'
