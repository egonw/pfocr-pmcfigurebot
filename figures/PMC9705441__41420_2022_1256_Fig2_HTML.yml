figure_title: Anlotinib inhibits repair of IR-induced DNA double-strand breaks and
  enhances activation of STING pathway
caption: A Detection of γ-H2AX foci was performed at the indicated time point after
  irradiation (4 Gy). Data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. Student’s
  t test. B Expression levels of phosphorylated DNA-PKcs, ATM, ATR, CHK2, and CHK1
  were detected at the indicated time point after irradiation (4 Gy). Western blot
  quantification of phosphorylated DNA-PKcs, ATM, ATR, CHK2, and CHK1, normalized
  to Actin. Results are shown as a representative of n = 3 independent repeats. C
  Representative images and quantitative analysis of PicoGreen staining. Cells with
  cytosolic DNA were counted. Scale bar, 10 μm. Student’s t test. D Western blot revealed
  that anlotinib combined with IR increased the expression of p-TBK1 and p-IRF3. *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
