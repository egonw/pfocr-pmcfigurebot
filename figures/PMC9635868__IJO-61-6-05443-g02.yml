caption: Knockdown of PPP1R14D induces LUAD cell arrest at the G1 phase. (A-C) Flow
  cytometric analysis of A549 and PC-9 cells. (D-F) The G1 phase-related proteins
  c-Myc, CDK2 and Cyclin E1 were significantly downregulated after knockdown of PPP1R14D
  in A549 and PC-9 cells. GAPDH was used as the loading control. One-way ANOVA; *P<0.05,
  **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs. Scramble. PPP1R14D, protein phosphatase 1 regulatory
  subunit 14D; LUAD, lung adenocarcinoma; sh-short hairpin.
article_title: PPP1R14D promotes the proliferation, migration and invasion of lung
  adenocarcinoma via the PKCÎ±/BRAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway.
