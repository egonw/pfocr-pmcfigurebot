caption: Cellular analogs in bone and the brain. Specialized cells within the bone
  and the brain have phenotypic and functional analogs in the reciprocal organ system
  that share certain signaling mechanisms. Osteoclast and microglia (A) are resident
  macrophages of bone and brain, respectively, that share hematopoietic stem cells
  (HSCs) origins and remove materials from their resident tissues to maintain proper
  tissue function. Both are affected by the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid
  cells 2 protein (TREM2)/DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa (DAP12) signaling pathway.
  Osteocytes and neurons (B) share a dendritic and axonal phenotype and also serve
  as sensory cells throughout the body and the skeleton. Both cell types utilize semaphorin
  3A (SEMA3A) to direct axonal projections and are derived from mesenchymal stem cells
  (MSCs). Osteoblast and myelinating cells (oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells) (C)
  produce materials that support the functions of their resident tissues and require
  Wingless/Integrated-1 (Wnt) signaling for proper differentiation from their MSC
  origins. P13K, phosphoinositide 3-kinases; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinases;
  NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; PYK2, protein tyrosine kinase 2; DKK1, dickkopf Wnt signaling
  pathway inhibitor 1; SOST, sclerostin.
