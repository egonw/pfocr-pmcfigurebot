caption: Role of Janus kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT)
  and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathways in tendon healing and degeneration.
  Simplified scheme of selected signalling pathways involved in tendon healing. The
  balance of M1 and M2 macrophage polarization plays a central role in resolving the
  inflammatory phase and affects the outcome of tendon healing. Proinflammatory cytokines
  released during dominant and prolonged M1 macrophage polarization stimulate molecular
  factors released in response of the JAK/STAT pathway activation, which can trigger
  the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) shift of tendon cells. SASP
  is associated with degenerative features in healing tendons. Mediators released
  during M2 macrophage polarization, including anti-inflammatory cytokines such as
  interleukin (IL)-10, stimulate other parts of the JAK/STAT pathway. Proteoglycans
  such as biglycan and fibromodulin can bind and stabilize growth factors activating
  the BMP pathway. Tenomodulin produced by the tendon cells can exert pro-proliferative
  effect as well as protective roles against cellular senescence and unrestrained
  angiogenesis. The image was created by G. G. Schulze-Tanzil using Krita 4.1.7 (Krita
  Foundation, The Netherlands). β-gal, β-galactosidase; ECM, extracellular matrix;
