caption: Effect of polyamine modulation of mTORC1 downstream proteins phosphorylation.
  MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in 5 mM DFMO containing growth medium with no amino
  acids supplementation for 48 h. Cells were thereafter serum starved for 12 h after
  which medium was refreshed and supplemented with 100 µM and 50 µM spermidine and
  spermine, respectively, for the indicated time. Thereafter cells were harvested
  and processed for Western blot protein expression determination. (a) Level of phosphorylated
  4EBP1 and p70S6K as well as the level of eIF4E were determined on 12% SDS PAGE.
  β-actin was used as a loading control, Ctrl represent untreated control (b) Gel
  densitometry tracing from (a) was estimated using ImageJ software. Values shown
  are mean ± range, for two independent experiments for 4EBP1 and p70S6K.
