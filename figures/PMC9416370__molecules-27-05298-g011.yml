caption: 'Effect of Gyp I on the expression of the TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway
  in vivo: (A) Effects of Gyp I on the expression of TLR4, MyD88, and NF-κB proteins.
  (B) Effects of Gyp I on the expression of NLRP3, caspase-1, and GSDMD-N proteins.
  Results are presented as mean ± SD of three independent experiments using one-way
  ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple-comparison test (#: p < 0.05, ####: p < 0.0001
  compared with Control group; *: p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01, ***: p < 0.001, ****: p
  < 0.0001 compared with ISO group).'
