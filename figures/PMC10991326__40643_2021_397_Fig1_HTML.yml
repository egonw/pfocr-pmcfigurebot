caption: 'The gene organization of the NAT biosynthetic gene cluster (nat BGC) (a)
  and the biosynthetic routes of the starting precursor for the NAT NRPS-PKS assembly
  line (b). The genes and related products of natH-L and natO are marked in green
  and blue, respectively. The bio-reaction schemes of 3-hydroxybenzoate (3-HBA) generation
  and loading processes are highlighted in red. The dashed arrow represents that anthranilate
  could be produced from chorismic acid via primary aromatic amino acid metabolism.
  A: adenylation; T: thiolation or acyl-carrier protein; C: condensation; KR: ketoreductase;
  KS: ketosynthase; AT: acyltransferase; MT: methyltransferase; TE: thioesterase'
