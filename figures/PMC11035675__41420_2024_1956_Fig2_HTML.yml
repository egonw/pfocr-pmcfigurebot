figure_title: GRP94 regulates LRP6 maturation and WNT pathway signaling
caption: a Control or GRP94KO MDA-MB231 cells were transfected with TOPflash/FOPflash
  reporter plasmids. At 24 h after transfection, β-catenin transcriptional activity
  was assessed by measuring luminescence. TOPflash values are presented as fold change
  compared to control cells. As a normalization control, β-galactosidase activity
  was used. Bars represent mean ± SD. ***p < 0.001 (Student’s t test). b mRNA expression
  levels of Wnt target genes in control or GRP94KO MDA-MB231 cells were validated
  using qRT-PCR. Cyclophilin was used as a normalization control. Statistical significance
  was calculated using Student’s t test. *p < 0.05; ***p < 0.001 (Student’s t test).
  c Wnt signaling-related markers were detected in control or GRP94KO MDA-MB231 cells
  with western blotting. The β-actin band was used as a normalization control. d Interaction
  of GRP94 with LRP6 was confirmed in HEK293 cells by transfecting cells with both
  Myc-GRP94 and Flag-LRP6 constructs. Immunoprecipitates were detected using indicated
  antibodies. As input control, 10% of cell lysates were used. e Stability of LRP6
  was assessed in control or GRP94KO MDA-MB231 cells after treatment with CHX (10 μM)
  for indicated time (left panel). Relative protein levels of LRP6 normalized to β-actin
  were plotted as bar graph (right panel). Statistical significance was determined
  using Student’s t test (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01). The experiment was performed in
  triplicate. Results are presented as mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
  f Confocal immunofluorescence analysis was performed to check co-localization of
  GRP94 and LRP6 in control or GRP94KO MDA-MB231 cells. Signal intensity corresponding
  to GRP94 and LRP6 was quantified using ImageJ software (right panel). Statistical
  analysis was performed using Student’s t test (***p < 0.001). Scale bar = 50 μm.
  Results are representative of at least three independent experiments and data are
  presented as mean ± SD.
