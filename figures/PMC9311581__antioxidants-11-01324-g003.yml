caption: Metabolic adaptation to oxidative stress and metabolic impairment. Several
  metabolic enzymes are vulnerable to elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels,
  including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), pyruvate kinase M2 isoform
  (PKM2), and mitochondrial trifunc-tional protein subunit β (TPβ). Metabolic adaptation
  during oxidative stress depends on the collaboration of several metabolic modulators
  that serve to promote metabolic reprograming through regulating the expression of
  metabolic enzymes. The transcriptions of a host of enzymes in the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP), the serine (Ser)-one carbon pathway, the glutathione pathway (GSH),
  and glutaminolysis are driven by nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2),
  including hexokinase 2 (HK2), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), phosphogluconate
  dehydrogenase (PGD), transaldolase (TALDO), transketolase (TKT), putrescine aminopropyltransferase
  (PAPT), methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2), phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase
  (PHGDH), phosphoserine phosphatase (PSDH), phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1),
  serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2), glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL), cystine/glutamate
  transporter (xCT), solute carrier family 1 member 5 (GLC1A5), and malic enzyme 1
  (ME1), while several other enzymes involved in the de novo synthesis of fatty acids
  are transcriptionally inhibited by NRF2, such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1),
  ATP-citrate lyase (ACL), and fatty acid synthase (FAS). Hypoxia-inducible factor
  (HIF) members promote the expression of enzymes involved in anaerobic glycolysis,
  de novo synthesis of fatty acids, and glutaminolysis, including glucose transporters
  (GLUTs), GAPDH, PKM, siah E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2 (SIAH2), pyruvate dehydrogenase
  kinase (PDK), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), and glutaminase GLS; on the other
  hand, HIFs inhibit the expression of enzymes governing the degradation of fatty
  acids, such as acyl-CoA dehydrogenase long chain (LCAD) and acyl-CoA dehydrogenase
  medium chain (MCAD). Several enzymes involved in the PPP, degradation of fatty acids,
  and glutaminolysis, including GLUT, PGD, TALDO, ribulose-5-phosphate-3-epimerase
  (RPE), acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACSS), and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), are transcriptionally
  activated by forkhead box protein O (FOXO). Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) promotes the
  transcription of PKM and glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 2 (GOT2). In addition,
  the activity of TKT, PDK, and ACL is regulated by Serine/Threonine Kinase 1 (AKT).
