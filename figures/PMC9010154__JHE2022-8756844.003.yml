caption: Inhibition of GC cell malignancy by the AIM2 knockdown. (∗P < 0.05, Data
  obtained from three independent are represented as means and standard errors.) (a)
  BGC-823 and MGC-803 GC cells were separated into control, NC, and sh-AIM2 treatment
  groups and used in EdU incorporation assays to evaluate cell proliferation. (b)
  The average colony counts were decreased by the AIM2 knockdown in colony formation
  assay. (c) A wound healing assessment was employed for appraising the influences
  of AIM2 knockdown on GC cell migration. (d) Transwell assessments were utilized
  for evaluating the impact of AIM2 knockdown on GC cell invasion.
