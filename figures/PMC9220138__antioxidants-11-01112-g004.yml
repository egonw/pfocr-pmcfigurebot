caption: Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activation and mitochondria.
  (A) Nrf2 upregulates fatty-acid catabolism via β-oxidation, a process occurring
  in the mitochondria by inducing the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase
  1 (CPT1), the rate-limiting enzyme in this mechanism. In contrast, Nrf2 inhibits
  acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) via phosphorylation, preventing lipid biosynthesis.
  Furthermore, Nrf2 inhibits stearoyl-CoA desaturase. Nrf2 also induces the expression
  of the enzymes involved in the tricarboxylic-acid (TCA) cycle, upregulating this
  pathway. Nrf2 participates in mitochondria biogenesis by interacting with the peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) and nuclear respiratory
  factor 1 (NRF1), promoting the expression of transcription factor A, mitochondrial
  (TFAM). Moreover, NRF1 contains at least four binding sites for Nrf2, participating
  in antioxidant response. (B) Nrf2 overactivation might induce the overexpression
  of cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), the principal receptor to fatty-acid uptake,
  leading to the accumulation of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) in the cytosol. LDLs
  are lipids with a major propensity for oxidation, forming oxidized LDLs (oxLDLs),
  further damaging the mitochondria. Moreover, macrophages engulf oxLDLs, which causes
  macrophage foam-cell formation. Nrf2 upregulation also induces mitochondrial membrane
  potential, decreases respiratory capacity, and alters mitochondrial thiol protein
  groups, leading to the alteration of mitochondrial redox signaling pathways. The
  figure was created using BioRender.
