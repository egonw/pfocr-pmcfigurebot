figure_title: Simvastatin synergises with a dual USP28/25 inhibitor to reduce viability
  of SCC cells
caption: a Human ADC (H1299 and EKXV) and SCC (LUDLU and H2170) cells were treated
  with different concentrations of simvastatin for 72 h. Cell viability was determined
  using crystal violet staining. b A431, H2170 and LUDLU cells were treated with indicated
  concentrations of simvastatin (Sim) or AZ1 in medium containing 1% FCS for 72 h.
  Drug synergy was calculated using ZIP model. c Working model for the regulation
  of SREBP2 by USP28. Created with BioRender.com.
article_title: USP28 controls SREBP2 and the mevalonate pathway to drive tumour growth
  in squamous cancer.
