caption: 'The effect of AS on the TLR4/NF-kB pathway related proteins expression in
  LPS-induced ARDS mice. Western blot was used to detect the relative protein expression
  of p–NF–kB P65, NF-kB P65, TLR2, and TLR4 in the lung tissue of each group of mice,
  β-actin was used as the internal control. ▲▲P < 0.01 vs. Control group. ★P < 0.05
  vs. LPS group. AS: artesunate. LPS : Lipopolysaccharide.'
