figure_title: Ferutinin regulates the ATG7 gene epigenetically in DPSCs
caption: Autophagy signaling pathway molecule ATG7 was analyzed using KLF2-ChIP and
  quantitative PCR methods after the addition of ferutinin to the DPSCs for 24 h.
  Active marks of the ATG7 gene for both H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac molecules were evaluated
  in the promoter site using two different primers such as A ATG7-1 and B ATG7-2,
  and shown graphically. Vehicle-treated DPSCs were considered as a control. Star
  (*) indicates a statistical significance (p < 0.05) when compared ferutinin-treated
  cells to the controls (n = 3).

  of KLF2 and autophagy/mitophagy.
