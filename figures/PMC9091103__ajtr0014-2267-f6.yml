caption: Knockdown of ZNRF2 reversed the effect of miR-107 inhibitor in MCF-7/TAM
  via mediating the PI3K/AKT pathway. A. Results of cell invasion by the transwell
  chamber assay. B. Cell apoptosis by flow cytometry. C. Western blotting assay was
  performed to examine the proteins that participate in the PI3K/AKT pathway. All
  data are represented as mean Â± SD. Each assay was performed in triplicate. *P <
  0.05, ***P < 0.001.
