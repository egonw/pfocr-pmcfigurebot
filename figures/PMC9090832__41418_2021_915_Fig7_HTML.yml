figure_title: Olig2-Ddx20 axis-mediated suppression of p53 pathway
caption: Schematic drawing the model of this study. Ddx20 deletion leads to SMN degradation
  and dysregulation of snRNA repertoires, indicating that Ddx20 contributes to SMN
  complex maintenance and snRNP assembly. Ddx20 ablation also promotes the p53 stabilization
  and the expression of its target genes through DNA damage and splicing dysregulation
  of Mdm2 mRNA, resulting in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in NPCs and OPCs. These
  results suggest that Ddx20 suppresses the p53 pathway through genome stabilization
  and splicing regulation of Mdm2 mRNA. Importantly, Olig2-mediated Ddx20 stabilization
  contributes to SMN complex maintenance and normal snRNP assembly, leading to the
  inhibition of p53-mediated apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in NPCs.

  oligodendrocyte progenitor cells via proper Mdm2 splicing and p53 suppression.
