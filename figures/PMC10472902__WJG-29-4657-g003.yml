caption: 'Toll-like receptor 4 knockout alleviated dextran sodium sulphate-induced
  inflammation in the colon. A: Scheme of the animal experimental design; B: The change
  in body weight of mice from days 0 to 7 during the disease course (knockout-dextran
  sodium sulphate [KO-DSS]: n = 8; wild type [WT]-DSS: n = 7); C: The bar chart represents
  the disease activity index (DAI) score on day 7; D: Representative colons (left)
  and statistical analysis (right) of colonic length; E: Representative hematoxylin
  and eosin staining of colon tissues (left), original magnification 100 Ã—, and histological
  scores (right). aP < 0.05, bP < 0.01, and cP < 0.001 were considered statistically
  significant. FMT: Fecal microbiota transplantation.'
