caption: Salmonella (S.C.) targeting tumor potential and induction of tumor autophagy
  in vivo. (A) The mice bearing ASH-3 were injected intraperitoneally with Salmonella
  (2×106 cfu) at day 0. The mice were sacrificed at day 7, 14, 21, and 28 to calculate
  the amounts of Salmonella in the tumor, liver and spleen. (B) The mice bearing KMH-2
  were injected intraperitoneally with Salmonella (2×106 cfu) at day 0. The mice were
  sacrificed at day 7 and 14 to calculate the amounts of Salmonella in the tumor,
  liver and spleen. Each value represents mean ± SD from 3 mice. (C) Tumors were excised
  on day 14 and the protein expression of autophagic markers in tumor cells derived
  from Salmonella-treated mice or control mice was determined by Western blotting.
  Inserted values indicated relative protein expressions in comparison with β-actin.
  Tumor were excised at day 7 (D) and day 14 (E), the expression of P-AKT, P-mTOR,
  F4/80, Ly-6G, PCNA, and LC3-II were detected by immunohistochemistry. Scale bar
  = 30 µm (200X).
