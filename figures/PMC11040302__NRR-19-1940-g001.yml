caption: Brain protection mechanism of artificial hibernation technology.Acute brain
  injury can cause dysfunction of ion channels, increase intracellular sodium, promote
  the production of free radicals and calcium influx, and aggravate neuronal damage.
  Low temperature can increase the expression levels of RNA binding motif protein
  3 (RBM3) and RNA binding protein (CIRP). RBM3 can reduce neuronal loss, protect
  synapses, reduce cell apoptosis, and promote cell recovery. Overexpressed CIRP can
  inhibit H2O2 and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α)-mediated activation of Akt
  and ERK pathways and inhibit neuronal apoptosis. Acute brain injury can activate
  microglia and astrocytes, secrete a variety of inflammatory mediators, aggravate
  neuronal damage, and increase the probability of cerebral vasospasm. Artificial
  hibernation technology can reduce MyD88-dependent Toll-like receptor (TLR4) signaling
  pathways, weaken the activation of microglia, and reduce the proinflammatory factors
  tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β, and the expression levels
  of IL-12, IL-23 protein and mRNA, increase the anti-inflammatory factors IL-10,
  arginase, and CD163. After acute brain injury, the probability of increased reactive
  oxygen species increases, leading to neuroinflammation, secondary neuronal damage,
  and even death. Artificial hibernation technology activates Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway,
  superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase activities, and reduces oxidative
  damage. Created using Microsoft PowerPoint.
