caption: 'The STT3A inhibitor NGI-1 confirmed its effect on the biological behavior
  of lung adenocarcinoma cells. (A,B) NGI-1 inhibited PC-9 and H1299 cell proliferation,
  without inducing apoptosis in both cell lines. (C) Consistent with the knockout
  group, NGI-1 significantly affected the G0/G1 cell-cycle transition, and the quantification
  data were analyzed by ModFit 5. (D,E) The migration and invasion ability of NGI-1
  treated cells was evaluated by Transwell assay (with or without Matrigel). Scale
  bar: 100 µm. (F) The wound-healing experiment also confirmed the effect of the STT3A
  inhibitor on cell migration ability, Scale bar: 500 µm. The histograms are based
  on the quantification data for the reciprocal assays in (D-F). PI, Propidium Iodide.
  Staining method for (D,E): 0.5% crystal violet; magnification, ×100. The data are
  presented as the mean ± standard deviation according to the Student’s t-test. **,
  P<0.01; ***, P<0.001, ****, P<0.0001. STT3A, STT3 oligosaccharyltransferase complex
