figure_title: PSMC2 regulated the expression of RPS15A through competitive binding
  with hsa-let-7c-3p. (MGC-803)
caption: 'A Venny online tool was used to intersect the miRNAs targeted by PSMC2 and
  the miRNAs targeted by RPS15A. B The levels of PSMC2 mRNA and hsa-let-7c-3p in MGC-803
  cells were determined by qPCR after PSMC2 knockdown. C Schematic diagram of the
  binding of hsa-let-7c-3p to h-PSMC2-3’UTR target site, and the mutation sequence
  of the PSMC2 gene. D The dual-luciferase reporter assay was conducted to detect
  the interaction between hsa-let-7c-3p and PSMC2. E Schematic diagram of the binding
  of hsa-let-7c-3p to h-RPS15A-3’UTR target site, and the mutation sequence of the
  RPS15A gene. F The dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to detect the interaction
  between hsa-let-7c-3p and RPS15A. G The apoptosis of MGC-803 cells after inhibiting
  hsa-let-7c-3p or downregulating PSMC2 was determined by flow cytometry. H Transwell
  assay were conducted to determine the changes in the migration ability of MGC-803
  cells after inhibiting hsa-let-7c-3p or downregulating PSMC2. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001, compared with shCtrl+Control group. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001,
  compared with hsa-let-7c-3p inhibitor or PSMC2 knockdown group. Error bars meant
  SD.'
