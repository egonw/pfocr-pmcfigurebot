caption: Establishment of the molecular subgroup of prostate cancer. (a) The unsupervised
  hierarchical clustering method established the molecular subgroup of prostate cancer
  based on the expression of 19 tyrosine metabolism-related enzymes; (b) principal
  component analysis (PCA) showed the clustering of two molecular subgroups; (c) Kaplanâ€“Meier
  plot and logrank analysis showed the survival difference between S1 and S2 subgroups;
  (d) univariate Cox regression analysis revealed the prognostic role of tyrosine
  metabolism-related genes in prostate cancer; (e) the differentially expressed genes
  between S2 and S1 subgroups; (f) GSEA revealed the difference between S2 and S1
  subgroups at the pathway level.
