caption: 'Implementing sgRNAO-driven CRISPR regulatory programs for the control of
  the violacein metabolic pathway. (A) The violacein biosynthesis in bacteria. Through
  a combination of five enzymatic and one non-enzymatic steps L-Trp is converted to
  violacein. In addition to violacein, the branched pathway can lead to the synthesis
  of three additional compounds through steps catalysed by VioC and VioD. (B) Transferring
  the five violacein pathway enzymes to S. cerevisiae for sgRNAO-driven CRISPR regulation.
  Out of the five enzymes, VioB and VioE are constitutively expressed by strong promoters
  (TDH3 and PGK1, respectively), VioD by an average strength promoter (TEF1), and
  VioA and VioC by very weak promoters (REV1 and RNR2, respectively). At its default
  state, this genetic pathway is unable to lead to the biosynthesis of significant
  amounts of any of the four possible compounds due to the very low expression of
  VioA. Utilizing a combination of sgRNAOs and sgRNAs targeting VioA, VioC and VioD,
  RNA programs that lead to the production of all four compounds can be achieved.
  (C) HPLC analysis of violacein pathway product distribution from S. cerevisiae strains
  expressing varying RNA programs. Cells were grown in SC (synthetic complete) glucose
  media for 72 h and compounds were extracted in methanol. (D) HPLC analysis of violacein
  pathway product distribution from S. cerevisiae strains expressing varying RNA programs.
  Cells were grown in SD-URA-LEU glucose solid cultures for 72 h and compounds were
  extracted in methanol. N/R: No regulation. Red arrows are pointing to dominant compounds
  based on peak area calculations (shown in ).'
