caption: 'Metabolism map of the central metabolic pathway of A. succinogenes, the
  green arrow represents the C3 pathway. All green arrows represent the C3 pathway,
  and the green dotted line represents pathway disruption.Metabolites: G-6-P – glucose-6-phosphate,
  F-6-P – fructose-6-phosphate, G-3-P – glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, Glycerate-3-P
  – glycerate-3-phosphate, Glycerate-2-P – glycerate-2-phosphate, PEP – phosphoenolpyruvate,
  OAA – oxaloacetic acid, Mal – malic acid, Fum – fumaric acid, SA – succinic acid,
  Pyr – pyruvic acid, For – formic acid, AcCOA – acetyl-COA, AcP – acetylphosphate,
  AC – acetic acid, AcAld – acetaldehyde, EtOH – ethanol, BAC – bisulfite-acetaldehyde
  complexEnzymes: PGAM – phosphoglycerate mutase, ENO – enolase, PEPCK – PEP carboxykinase,
  ASPC – aspartate aminotransferase, MDH – malate dehydrogenase, FM – fumarase, FRD
  – fumarate reductase, OAD – oxaloacetate decarboxylase, PK – pyruvate kinase, PDH
  – pyruvate dehydrogenase, PFL – pyruvate formate-lyase, FDH – formate dehydrogenase,
  PTA – phosphate acetyltransferase, ACK – acetate kinase, ADHE – acetaldehyde-alcohol
  dehydrogenase. LipB – lipoyl-transferase, LipA – lipoyl-synthase'
