caption: Co-stimulatory signaling pathways of the Immunoglobulin and TNF-R superfamilies.
  CD28 binds to B7 family members CD80 and CD86. Interaction with these ligands initiates
  the recruitment of adaptor molecules including PI3K, Lck and Grb2. PI3K and Lck
  activate PDK1 which diverges to activate both canonical NF-κB through Akt activation
  and NFAT through GSK3β inhibition. The binding of Grb2/GADS initiates the SLP76/LAT/Vav
  complex formation which activates PLCγ1 leading to NFAT-dependent gene transcription.
  PLCγ1 also activates PKCθ, which regulates activation of NF-κB. Grb2 can also localize
  independently at the distal motif to mediate MAPK and JNK activation, promoting
  nuclear translocation of the AP-1 complex. 4-1BB binds to its sole ligand 4-1BBL,
  which induces the recruitment of TRAF molecules. TRAF2 mediates RIP1 ubiquitination
  leading to the recruitment of TAK1 and activation of the IKK complex. IKK activation
  promotes the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of IκB, releasing NF-κB
  subunits from an inhibitory state. Independent of NF-κB signaling, TRAF2 also activates
  upstream MAPK, MEKK1 and ASK-1, which initiate the p38 MAPK signaling cascade and
  the JNK/SAPK pathway, respectively. Transcriptional activity induced by both Ig
  and TNF-R signaling induce anti-apoptotic signals, T cell proliferation and cytokine
  production (IL-2).
