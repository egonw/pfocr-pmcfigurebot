caption: A The image of phosphorylated protein content determination array (top panel).
  Core differential proteins were screened by |fold change| > 1.2 of the phosphorylation
  Ab array (bottom panel). B Western blotting showed that p-STAT3 was the most differentially
  expressed protein. C Western blot was performed to detect autophagy-related protein
  expression in HCCLM3 cells. The relative density of each band was analyzed by ImageJ
  software. D Indicated Cells were exposed to IL-6 (20 ng/mL, 24 h). Whole-cell lysates
  were analyzed by Western blotting. E Western blot was performed to detect JAK1,
  JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2 expression in the indicated cells. F Indicated cells were exposed
  to Hypoxia (20 h). Whole-cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting. G Typical
  IF images of CYB5A and p-STAT3 expression in the indicated HCC cell lines. H p-STAT3,
  LC-3B, and CYB5A levels in lung xenograft tumors were shown by IHC. To prove that
  CYB5A inhibits STAT3 rather than parallelism, we performed rescue experiments in
  vitro and in vivo (Supplementary figs.  and ).
