caption: Positive TLR4 expression is detected in six different pancreatic cancer cell
  lines but not the HPDE normal pancreatic cell line. (A) mRNA expression levels of
  TLR4 quantified by RT-qPCR from the current study and retrieved from the Cancer
  Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) Expression 22Q2 Public database. (B) Protein expression
  level of TLR4 assessed by Western blot analyses, the two bands of TLR4 appeared
  to be glycosylated (130 kDa) and deglycosulated (100 kDa) TLR4 [,]. (C) Relative
  mRNA levels of TLR1~9 in two representative pancreatic cancer cell lines. The mRNA
  expression levels were adjusted based on the two cell lines’ TLR4 data from (A).
  Data are represented as a mean ± SD from triplicates, ** p < 0.01, **** p < 0.0001
  (indicating differences between Panc-1 and BxPC-3) were obtained from two-way ANOVA
  and post-hoc multiple comparisons with Bonferroni correction.
