caption: Polyubiquitination of TRAF3 at K168 and K181 triggered by the TLR4 signaling
  pathway is the BCV selection signal for TfR vesicles. (A) Colocalization of TLR4
  (red) with NMEC expressing GFP (green) in infected HBMECs at 4 h p.i. Bar = 5 μm.
  The number indicates the percentage of BCVs colocalized with TLR4 relative to total
  intracellular BCVs (n = 3 slides). (B) NMEC transcytosis in HBMECs transfected with
  control siRNA or siRNA targeting TLR4 (Left), NMEC transcytosis in HBMECs pretreated
  with 1, 20, or 100 nM TAK-242 (Middle), and ΔmsbB transcytosis in HBMECs at 6.5
  h p.i. (Right). Data are presented as the means ± SEMs (n = 3). (C) Immunoblot analysis
  of TRAF3, RCC2, RalA, SEC6, and SNAP23 in the BCV fractions isolated from NMEC-infected
  HBMECs transfected with control siRNA or siRNA targeting TLR4 (Left) and of TRAF3,
  RCC2, RalA, SEC6, and SNAP23 in the BCV fractions isolated from ΔmsbB-infected HBMECs
  (Right). (D and E). Colocalization of intracellular NMEC with TfR at 4 h p.i. in
  HBMECs transfected with control siRNA or siRNA targeting TRAM (D, Left) or TRIF
  (E, Left). Bar graph shows the percentage of BCVs colocalized with TfR relative
  to total intracellular BCVs. Data are presented as the means ± SEMs (n = 3 slides).
  Immunoblot analysis of TRAF3, RalA, and TfR in the BCV fractions isolated from NMEC-infected
  HBMECs transfected with control siRNA or siRNA targeting TRAM (D, Right) or TRIF
  (E, Right). (F) NMEC transcytosis in HBMECs transfected with control siRNA or siRNA
  targeting TRAM or TRIF at 6.5 h p.i. Data are presented as the means ± SEMs (n =
  3). (G) Effect of TRIF deficiency on penetration of the BBB by NMEC in vivo. Eighteen-day-old
  C57BL/6J mice and gene-deficient TRIF−/− mice (n = 9) were infected with NMEC via
  the tail vein and sacrificed at 4 h p.i. One microliter of blood (Left) or cerebrospinal
  fluid (Right) from each mouse was plated for colony counting. (H and I) NMEC transcytosis
  at 6.5 h p.i. in infected HBMECs transfected with control pcDNA3.1 vector or pcDNA3.1
  overexpressing WT TRAF3 or mutant TRAF3 (H), or pcDNA3.1 overexpressing WT ubiquitin
  or mutant ubiquitin (I). Data are presented as the means ± SEMs (n = 3). Significance
  is indicated by the P values. ns, nonsignificant. GAPDH or bacterial GroEL (in C,
  D, and E) was used to show that equal amounts of infected cells or BCVs were employed;
  TCL, total cell lysate.
