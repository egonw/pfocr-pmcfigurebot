caption: Workflow for data (pre)processing and analysis. The various steps (1–8) involve
  preprocessing of raw data into clean data. Eventually, the data is normalized, and
  each analyte will be relatively quantified based upon the total summed area of all
  analytes observed in a measurement (%area), also known as direct glycosylation traits.
  To obtain insights in the biosynthetic pathway specific glycosylation features can
  be summed (e.g., galactosylation, sialylation, fucosylation). Either the direct
  or derived glycosylation traits can be used for statistical evaluation and the whole
  data set can be integrated with other data sets (e.g., proteomics or genomics).
