caption: 'Analysis of differentially phosphorylated proteins in MA-10 Leydig cells
  treated with Forskolin or Forskolin+AICAR. LC-MS/MS was performed on enriched phosphopeptides
  extracted and digested from MA-10 Leydig cells treated with Forskolin (Fsk, 10 µm)
  or Fsk+AICAR (10 µM and 1 mM, respectively) for 1 h. Phosphorylated proteins were
  then quantified and compared between treatments. Results are the mean of three individual
  experiments, each performed in triplicate. (A) Consensus sequence motif of phosphorylated
  peptides. The amino acid chosen is the one with the highest probability of being
  phosphorylated. (B) Volcano plot comparing the level of phosphorylated proteins
  detected by LC-MS/MS in Fsk-treated vs. Fsk+AICAR-treated MA-10 Leydig cells (to
  observe the effects of AICAR). Each dot represents a distinct phosphoprotein. A
  Log2 fold change of +/−1.17 (corresponds to 2.25-fold) with a p-value of 0.05 was
  used and is represented by the blue dotted lines. In response to AICAR, blue dots
  depict a decrease in phosphorylation level (one protein is identified in that group:
  NUMA1), while red dots correspond to an increase in phosphorylation level (three
  proteins are identified in that group: MAPT, PARD3, NFATC3). Grey dots correspond
  to proteins with no significant changes in phosphorylation levels. (C) Heatmap of
  protein phosphorylation levels for differentially phosphorylated proteins between
  treatments (Fsk vs. Fsk+AICAR). The name of the protein in indicated. The scale
  on the right represents expression levels (Log10). Biological Process (D), Pathway
  Analysis (E), Cellular Component (F), and Molecular Function (G) of the differentially
  phosphorylated proteins are shown.'
