caption: Overall pathway analysis and interferon signaling in the CT26 proteome upon
  irradiation.A, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of differentially expressed proteins at
  48 h post 10 Gy irradiation (-Log2 fold change >1.5). B, Interferon Signaling Ingenuity
  Pathway visualized with p-values for quantifiable proteins in the CT26 proteome.
  C, normalized intensity plots of proteins encompassing the Interferon Signaling
  Pathway. D, the Activation of IRF pathway in the CT26 proteome upon irradiation.
  Points are representative of mean ± SD values of three biological replicates and
  p-values are representative of two-way ANOVA, where gray indicates untreated, and
  orange indicates 10 Gy treated. CT, cancer testis.
