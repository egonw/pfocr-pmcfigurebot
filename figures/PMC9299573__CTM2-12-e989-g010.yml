caption: Exosomes derived from cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs) induce tumour
  growth and chemoresistance, and activate PI3K/AKT pathway in a nude mouse non‐small‐cell
  lung cancer (NSCLC) model. HCC827 cells were processed with exosomes derived from
  normal tissue‐associated fibroblasts (NAFs) or CAFs were subcutaneously injected
  into nude mice, which were treated or untreated with DDP. (A) Subcutaneous tumours
  in each group were excised and displayed. (B) Tumour volume was measured at the
  end of 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. (C) qPCR analysis of miR‐20a expression in tumours.
  (D) Western blotting analysis of PTEN, PI3K‐p85, PI3K‐p100, PI3K, pAKT and AKT.
  Outcomes are means ± standard deviation (SD) (*p < .05; **p < .01; ***p < .001)

  the PTEN/PI3K‐AKT pathway to promote the progression and chemoresistance of non‐small
  cell lung cancer.
