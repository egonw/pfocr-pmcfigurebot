caption: Identification and functional annotation of the differentially expressed
  genes between rosacea tissues and healthy controls. (A) A volcano plot showing the
  upregulated DEGs (red dots) and downregulated DEGs (green dots) of rosacea tissues
  compared with healthy controls. (B) A hierarchical clustering heatmap showing the
  predominant differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs of rosacea tissues compared
  with healthy controls. The expression of S100A9 was significantly upregulated. (C)
  A bubble plot showing the enrichment of the candidate DEGs by GO analysis. (D) A
  bubble plot showing the enrichment of the candidate DEGs by KEGG analysis. (E) The
  enrichment score ranking of the DEGs by GSEA. The pathways with the highest enrichment
  scores were neutrophil degranulation and the chemokine signaling pathway. HV, healthy
  volunteers; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator activated receptors; TNF, tumor necrosis
  factor; IL-17, interleukin-17; Th17, T helper cell 17; Th1 cell, T helper cell 1;
  Th2 cell, T helper cell 2; DEG, differentially expressed genes; mRNA, messenger
  RNA; lncRNA, long non-coding RNA; GO, Gene Ontology; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of
  Genes and Genomes; GSEA, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis.
