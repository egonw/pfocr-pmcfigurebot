figure_title: Proposed model for calcineurin-regulated ß(1,3)-glucan exposure
caption: 'Our data suggest that calcineurin serves as a switchboard in mediating ß(1,3)-glucan
  exposure in response to different stimuli: hyperactive STE11ΔN467 expression (black
  lines), caspofungin exposure (red lines), and high levels of exogenous calcium (blue
  lines). With regards to hyperactive STE11ΔN467 expression, we propose that activation
  of the downstream transcription factor Cph1 leads to increased expression of the
  cell wall sensor Dfi1 as well as architectural cell wall changes that are then sensed
  by these same Dfi1 proteins. This sensor in turn interacts with calmodulin to initiate
  signal transduction down a Dfi1/calmodulin/calcineurin signal transduction pathway
  and further increases ß(1,3)-glucan unmasking. In response to caspofungin exposure,
  calcineurin is also necessary to induce the full levels of unmasking observed in
  wild-type cells. Based on our data, calcineurin may act in a partially Dfi1 dependent
  manner, but an alternative regulator also mediates calcineurin activity in response
  to caspofungin treatment. Lastly, we propose that calcineurin is also capable of
  decreasing ß(1,3)-glucan exposure levels in response to growth in high levels of
  exogenous calcium, and is likely mediated via the canonical calmodulin/calcineurin/Crz1
  signal transduction pathway. Dotted arrows indicate putative pathways that have
  not yet been experimentally confirmed.'
