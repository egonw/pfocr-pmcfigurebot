caption: The splicing was disturbed under heat stress. a The heatmap of splicing pathway-related
  DEGs in R. moulmainense leaves after heat- and mock treatment for 4 h and 7 days.
  b Verification for mRNA-seq data about spliceosome pathway by RT-qPCR. The expression
  of RoGAPDH was used as the control. R represents the correlation coefficient between
  the expression patterns of mRNA-seq data and RT-qPCR results, determined using the
  two-tailed Student’s t-test, and mean values ± SE, n = 3. c Alternative splicing
  schematic and AS event diversity in R. moulmainense. The diagram illustrates AS
  events with black rectangles denoting flanking exons, gray rectangles indicating
  differential exons, thick black line representing introns, and thin black arc denotes
  spliced sequences. d The five AS event types schematic diagram and the proportion
  of differential AS event types under heat stress
article_title: Integrated analysis of transcriptome and small RNAome reveals regulatory
  network of rapid and long-term response to heat stress in Rhododendron moulmainense.
