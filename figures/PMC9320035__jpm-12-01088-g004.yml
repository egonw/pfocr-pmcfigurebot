caption: Spinal cord injury (SCI) morbidity presented as a continuum from the onset
  of neurogenic obesity to the development of cardiometabolic syndrome. SCI results
  in neurogenic obesity through the loss of metabolically active lean body mass (LBM)
  and a concurrent accumulation of adipose tissue (AT). Obesity-induced hypoxia results
  in the dysregulation of AT, marked by a loss of AT plasticity and the secretion
  of non-esterified free fatty acids (NEFA) and proinflammatory adipokines (PIA).
  NEFA enter peripheral circulation, resulting in visceral (VAT) and ectopic fat deposition,
  thereby promoting systemic insulin resistance (IR). NEFA deposition in the liver
  stimulates increased glucose production and hepatic IR. Hepatic NEFA accumulation
  also promotes atherogenic dyslipidemia through triglyceride (TG) lipogenesis and
  the increased and decreased production of LDL- and HDL-cholesterol, respectively.
  NEFA deposition also occurs in the nearby pancreas, inducing Î²-cell dysfunction
  by lipotoxicity and dysglycemia/diabetes. NEFA storage in the liver also promotes
  hepatic glucagon resistance (GR) and hyper-aminoacidemia that stimulates glucagon
  secretion to compensate for hepatic GR. Hyperglucagonemia facilitates increased
  hepatic glucose release. In skeletal muscle, increased NEFA deposition promotes
  IR, inhibiting insulin-mediated glucose uptake. Overall, the systemic state of IR
  results in hyperinsulinemia. Hyperinsulinemia may increase sodium (Na+) reabsorption
  and sympathetic nervous system activity above the level of SCI, contributing to
  hypertension. PIA alter signaling pathways contributing to atherogenic dyslipidemia,
  hypertension, and insulin resistance/dysglycemia environment. Collectively, when
  these metabolic morbidities co-manifest, they present as cardiometabolic syndrome.
  Arrows represent stimulation/enhancement, flat ends demonstrate inhibition/repression,
  and dashed lines represent a progressive decrease in a pathway. Caption adapted
  from [].
