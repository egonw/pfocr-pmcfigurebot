caption: The schematic predicts the therapeutic efficacy of miR-378 silencing KLK
  genes in prostate cancer (PCa). The genes highlighted with a yellow background represent
  the gene sequences that partially complement miR-378 with at least 7 base pairs
  that sufficiently modulate their expression levels. The arrows represent promotion
  of the downstream gene activity, and the T sign (green) represents inhibition of
  their downstream genes. The AR gene might modulate the genes KLK2, KLK4, KLK6, and
  KLK14, and then feed back to itself through the PAR and the downstream RAS gene
  pathway.
