caption: Hyperactivity of the MAPK signaling pathway causes the sotorasib-addiction
  phenotype. A Effects of sotorasib withdrawal on the level of p-MEK1/2, MEK, p-ERK,
  ERK, and cleaved caspase-3 in the MIA-SR and H23-SR cells; protein levels were measured
  through Western blotting. B Phase-contrast microscopy images of the MIA-SR and H23-SR
  cells cultured with or without 5 μM sotorasib. C The MIA-SR and H23-SR cells were
  cultured with or without 5 μM sotorasib in the presence of different concentrations
  of the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib. The cells were counted on Day 7 (MIA-SR) and 13
  (H23-SR). Data are presented in terms of mean ± standard deviation values of three
  replicates. *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001
