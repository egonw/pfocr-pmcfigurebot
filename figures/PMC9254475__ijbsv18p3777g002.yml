caption: HTR1D promotes proliferation and migration of PCs in vitro. a The expressed
  level of HTR1D in 4 random pairs among 90 pairs of pancreatic cancer and paracancerous
  tissue microarrays. b The mRNA Expression level of HTR1D in different PCs. c The
  efficiency of two knockdown sequences was tested by qPCR in PANC-1 and CFPAC-1.
  d-e The absorbance at 450nm was measured to evaluate the effect on cell viability
  by CCK8. f-g EdU incorporation assay was performed to detect the proliferation of
  PANC-1 (f) and CFPAC-1 (g). h-i Quantification of the data shown in f and g. j-k
  Representative images of the migration ability of PANC-1 and CFPAC-1 by Transwell
  assay. l-m Representative images of colony formation assay for PANC-1 and CFPAC-1.
  n-o Representative images of wound healing assay for PANC-1 (n) and CFPAC-1 (o).
  p-q Quantification of the data shown in n and o. Each experiment was performed three
  times independently and results are presented as mean Â± s.d. Student's t-test was
  used to analyze the data. (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001)
