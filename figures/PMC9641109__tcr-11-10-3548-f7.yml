caption: Network map of enriched KEGG pathways. The purple bubbles represent the pathways,
  the red bubbles represent the upregulated genes, and the green ones represent the
  downregulated genes. Most enriched DEGs are down-regulated genes and enriched in
  more than one pathway. KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; DEGs, differentially
  expressed genes.
