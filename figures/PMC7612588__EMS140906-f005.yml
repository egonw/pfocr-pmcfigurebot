caption: Model proposed describing the PSMA-mGluR1-HER2 mechanism of resistance to
  dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitor DS-7423 (created with BioRender.com). HER2/X represents
  the HER2-containing receptor protein complex (X = EGFR or HER3 in  E/F). A feedback
  mechanism that is activated in response to PI3K/mTOR inhibition involves upregulation
  of ErbB/HER protein (HER2 or HER3) according to the genetically diverse prostate
  cancer cell lines we have tested. Downstream effects include a PSMA increase upon
  DS-7423 treatment is partially dependent on HER2 signaling. Targeting the PI3K/mTOR
  pathway has unraveled a complex relationship between PSMA increase and HER2 upregulation
  via mGluR1 activity ().
