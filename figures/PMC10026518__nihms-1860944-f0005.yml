figure_title: TRF increases rhythmicity of molecular pathways across tissues
caption: (A) Tissue by tissue overlap of rhythmic genes in each tissue in ALF (left)
  and TRF (right). (B) Distribution of the rhythmic genes ranked according to the
  number of tissues in which they are rhythmic in ALF (top) or TRF (bottom). (C) Heatmap
  of common Metascape annotated pathways for rhythmic genes in ALF or TRF that are
  enriched in ≥ 5 tissues. Pathways significantly enriched by overrepresentation analysis
  (ORA) (P<0.05) are shown. Pathways that are not enriched are represented in black.
  (D) Network analysis of Metascape annotated pathways for genes rhythmic in ALF (red)
  or TRF (blue) in ≥ 5 tissues. Each circle represents a distinct pathway annotation.
  The ratio of red or blue color in a circle indicates the number of enriched genes
  in that pathway annotation. Purple connections indicate common genes between various
  pathway annotations. The thickness of the purple connection represents the number
  of common genes. Pathways significantly enriched by overrepresentation analysis
  (ORA) (P<0.05) are shown. See also ,  and .
