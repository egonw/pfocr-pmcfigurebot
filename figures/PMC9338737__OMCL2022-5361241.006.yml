caption: Erastin and vitamin C trigger ferroptosis by regulating the AMPK/NRF2/HMOX1
  pathway. (a, b) The mRNA levels of CP, HMOX1, and FTH1 were analyzed in Patu8988
  and BxPC3 cell lines treated with erastin and/or vitamin C. (c, d) Ferroptosis and
  iron metabolism-related proteins were detected by Western blot analysis. (e, f)
  Western blotting analysis of the nuclear/cytoplasmic fraction showed NRF2 nuclear
  localization in Patu8988 and BxPC3 cells after treatment with erastin and/or vitamin
  C (∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001).
