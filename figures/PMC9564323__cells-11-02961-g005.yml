caption: MiRNAs target prediction and pathway analysis. TargetScan, Funrich, and miRDB
  were used to predict downstream target genes of miR–17–5p (A) and miR–193a–5p (D).
  Construction of miR–17–5p (B) and miR–193a–5p (E) centered target gene regulatory
  network. KEGG analysis of the enrichment pathway of miR–17–5p target genes (C) and
  miR–193a–5p target genes (F).
