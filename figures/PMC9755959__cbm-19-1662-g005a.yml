caption: RAB31 partially reverses miR-378a-3p-mediated suppression of GC. (A, B) Protein
  expression and statistical analysis of RAB31 in BGC-823 cells cotransfected with
  miR-378a-3p mimics and RAB31 overexpression (OE-RAB31) plasmid. (C) Proliferation
  ability of BGC-823 cells, determined by CCK-8 assays. (D, E) Number of transfected
  BGC-823 cell colonies. (F) Apoptosis rate of BGC-823 cells, detected via flow cytometry.
  (G, H) Migration of treated BGC-823 cells, detected by wound healing assays. The
  relative migration distance was calculated. (I, J) Transwell assay detection of
  the migration and invasion abilities of BGC-823 cells. The cells were counted. (K,
  L) Protein expression and statistical analysis of RAB31 in SGC-7901 cells cotransfected
  with miR-378a-3p inhibitor and RAB31 shRNA (shRAB31) plasmid. (M) Proliferation
  ability of SGC-7901 cells, determined with CCK-8 assays. (N, O) Number of SGC-7901
  cell colonies. (P) Apoptosis rate of SGC-7901 cells, measured via flow cytometry.
  (Q, R) Migration of SGC-7901 cells, detected by wound healing assays. The relative
  migration distance was calculated. (S, T) Transwell assay detection of the migration
  and invasion abilities of SGC-7901 cells. The cells were counted (*P < 0.05, **P
  < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).
