caption: 'Bioinformatics analysis of differential metabolites. (a) Hierarchical clustering
  heatmap of significant differential metabolites. Note: Each row in the figure represented
  a differential metabolite, and each column represented a group of samples. Red represented
  significant up-regulation, blue represented significant down-regulation, and the
  depth of the color represented the degree of up-regulation. Metabolites with similar
  expression patterns gather under the same cluster on the left. (b) Correlation heatmap
  of significant differential metabolites and intestinal microorganisms. Note: Red
  indicated a positive correlation, blue indicated a negative correlation, and white
  indicated a non-significant correlation. The color depth was related to theabsolute
  value of the correlation coefficient that was, the higher the degree of positive
  or negative correlation, and the darker the color was. The size of the square was
  related to the significance of the correlation, the smaller the p-value, the stronger
  the correlation, and the larger the square size was. (c) KEGG pathway annotation
  and analysis. Note: The vertical axis in the bar graph represented each KEGG metabolic
  pathway, and the horizontal axis represented the number of differentially expressed
  metabolites contained in each KEGG metabolic pathway. The color represented the
  p-value of the enrichment analysis, the darker the color, the smaller the p-value
  was, and the more significant the degree of enrichment, and the number on the column
  represented the rich factor.'
