caption: 'TAZ alleviated the inflammatory response in microglia(A) TAZ mRNA expression
  in BV2 microglial cells after treatment with LPS for 1, 2, 4, and 8 h. N = 3. (B)
  Western blot analysis of TAZ protein after exposure to LPS. N = 3. TAZ, total TAZ
  protein; p-TAZ, phospho-TAZ protein; nc, nuclear. (C and D) TAZ mRNA and protein
  expression after introduction of the TAZ overexpression plasmid. N = 3. Con, empty
  pcDNA3.1 vector; TAZ, TAZ overexpression plasmid. (E) Overexpression of TAZ down-regulated
  mRNA levels for IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α under inflammatory conditions. N = 6. (F)
  Activation of TAZ impeded release of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. N = 6. ∗p < 0.05 versus
  control in one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test, #p < 0.05 versus LPS treatment
  in one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test.'
