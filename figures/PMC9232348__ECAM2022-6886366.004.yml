caption: Curcumin increases the sensitivity to DDP-resistant NSCLC cells through regulating
  ER stress. After A549/DDP and H1299/DDP cells were cotreated with DDP and curcumin,
  salubrinal was used as an ER stress inhibitor to treat A549/DDP and H1299/DDP cells.
  (a–d) The expressions of CHOP, GRP78, XBP-1, ATF6, and caspase-4 were detected by
  qPCR and western blotting. (e) CCK-8 was used to detect cell viability; (f) the
  cell apoptosis rate was detected by flow cytometry. (g) Western blotting was used
  to measure the expressions of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP. Experiment data
  are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD), each experiment was conducted
  3 times. ∗P < 0.05, when compared with the curcumin + DDP + DMSO group; DDP, cisplatin;
  NSCLC, non-small-cell lung cancer; ER stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress.
