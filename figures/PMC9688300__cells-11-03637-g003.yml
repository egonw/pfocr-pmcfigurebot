caption: O-GlcNAcylation and NAFL-NASH-liver fibrosis-hepatoma tetralogy. The O-GlcNAcylation
  of the LXR, the ChREBP, and SREBP-1 promoted NAFL formation. O-GlcNAcylated NF-κB
  subunit p65 played a role in the progression of NASH by facilitating inflammatory
  damage, and the O-GlcNAcylated NF-κB subunit c-Rel exerted an anti-inflammatory
  effect. During liver fibrosis, O-GlcNAcylation of collagens accelerated fibrosis,
  while O-GlcNAcylation of the SRF represented anti-fibrotic effects. Finally, O-GlcNAcylated
  RIPK3 contributed to HCC. NAFL, non-alcoholic fatty liver; NASH, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis;
