caption: 'Effect of HMWF on RAGE-NF-κB signaling in intestinal inflammation in Caco-2
  cells. Caco-2 cell monolayers were pre-treated with 10 μM FPS-ZM1, a selective RAGE
  inhibitor before incubation with 10 μM MG-H1. (A) The protein expression of TJ markers
  in Caco-2 cells. (B) The protein expression of inflammatory mediators involved in
  RAGE signaling pathway in Caco-2 cells. The bar graph of the relative intensities
  of western blotting bands. (C) Localization of occludin measured by immunofluorescence.
  All values are presented as the mean ± SD. The data were analyzed by Dunnett’s t-test.
  * p < 0.05 versus the control cells, ** p < 0.01 versus the control cells, *** p
  < 0.001 versus the control cells, # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01 versus the MG-H1-treated
  cells; The localization of occludin (green) and nucleus (DAPI, blue) was determined
  using confocal laser scanning microscope with specific antibody; original magnification
  20×; scale bar 20 μm.'
