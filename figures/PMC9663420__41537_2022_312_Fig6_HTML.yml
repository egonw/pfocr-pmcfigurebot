figure_title: P2RX receptors and inflammatory markers in SCZ
caption: A A proposed P2RX receptor pathway leading to inflammation in SCZ. In response
  to activation of P2RX4 or P2RX7, the NLRP3 inflammasome activated pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. P2XRs may also act via the NF-kB pathway, an established inflammatory
  pathway in SCZ. These inflammatory molecules contribute to neuroinflammation, as
  indicated by upregulated expression of inflammatory marker SERPINA3 in SCZ. Solid
  arrows show direct relationship between targets and dashed arrows represent indirect
  relationship between targets. B Radar chart demonstrating differential P2RX4, P2RX7,
  NF-kB, and SERPINA3 gene expression in different cell types in human brain. CTL
  control, SCZ schizophrenia, DLPFC dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, IL interleukin,
  NLRP3 NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein-3, P2XR purinergic receptor,
  NF-kB nuclear factor kappa.
