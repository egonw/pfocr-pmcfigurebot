caption: Exosome biogenesis. A) Normal biogenesis pathway. B) Exosomes derived from
  cardiomyocytes may play a role in the development of cardiovascular disease from
  diabetes by upregulating antiangiogenic miR‐320 and downregulating proangiogenic
  miR‐126 in neighboring endothelial cells. C) In Parkinson's disease pathogenesis,
  exosomes from infected neurons and microglia act as carriers to transmit α‐synuclein
  (α‐syn) and proinflammatory cytokines. D) HIV‐infected cells secrete exosomes containing
  viral genomes, antigens, and other HIV‐associated proteins. The transfer of these
  viral products to other cells facilitates HIV infection. Created with BioRender.com.
