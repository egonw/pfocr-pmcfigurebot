caption: 'Diagram depicting ceramide synthesis and metabolism pathways. Ceramide generation
  takes place by three different pathways. The first one occurs at the plasma membrane
  in the presence of enzyme acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase). Hydrolysis of sphingomyelin
  in the presence of ASMase results in ceramide release. Secondly, the de novo pathway
  regulates ceramide generation by the condensation of palmitate and serine. 3-keto-dihydrosphingosine
  formed through this process is catabolized further to dihydroceramide. Ceramide
  generated in the endoplasmic reticulum is transported to the Golgi apparatus. This
  process is mediated by vesicle trafficking or by the involvement of ceramide transfer
  protein (CERT). Lastly, ceramide is generated by sphingolipids and glycosphingolipids
  degradation through the salvage pathway taking place in the late endosomes and the
  lysosomes. Ceramide can also be converted to complex sphingolipids. Abbreviations:
  CDase—ceramidase; CERK—ceramide kinase; CerS—ceramide synthase; DES—dihydroceramide
  desaturase; GalCase—galactosylceramidase; GalCS—galactosylceramide synthase; GCS—glucosylceramide
  synthase; GCase—glucocerebrosidase; KDSR—3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductase; S1P
  lyase—sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase; S1PPase—sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase;
  SK—sphingosine kinase; SMase—sphingomyelinase; SMS—sphingomyelin synthase; SPT—serine-palmitoyl
  transferase; UGCG—UDP-glucose ceramide glycosyltransferase; UGT8—UDP glycosyltransferase
