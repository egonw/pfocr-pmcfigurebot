caption: Microarray analysis of dysregulated genes following treatment with podofilox.
  (A) Heatmap of dysregulated genes in AGS cells treated with vehicle or podofilox.
  A total of 566 genes were upregulated, and 713 genes were downregulated. Green,
  downregulated genes; red, upregulated genes. (B) KEGG and HALLMARK pathway enrichment
  analyses of cell cycle, c-Myc and p53 signaling pathways. KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes.
