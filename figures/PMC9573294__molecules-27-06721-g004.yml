caption: 'ENPP1 facilitates EMT by modulating 2′3′-cGAMP levels in MDA-MB-231 and
  A549 Dual™ cells. (A–C) Pearson’s’ correlation was conducted on TCGA breast cancer
  data using cBioPortal. The mRNA expressions of mesenchymal markers (A) VIM, (B)
  N-CAD, and (C) TWIST1 were analyzed for their correlation with ENPP1 expression
  (r > 0.5, p < 0.05). (D–F) Effect of ENPP1 inhibitor (5 µM) on EMT markers at mRNA
  level with 2′3′-cGAMP (25 µM) in high-ENPP1 expression MDA-MB-231 cells. (D) VIM,
  (E) N-CAD, and (F) TWIST expression was evaluated through real-time PCR and data
  were normalized using GAPDH (n = 3). (G–J) EMT markers elevated in the presence
  of rENPP1 in A549 Dual™ cells. rENPP1 (5 µg/mL) along with 2′3′-cGAMP (25 µM) was
  added to A549 Dual™ cells and incubated for 24 h. mRNA levels were evaluated using
  RT-PCR. (G) VIM, (H) N-CAD, (I) TWIST1, and (J) IFN-β (n = 3). The p-values were
  calculated with respect to the no-treatment group using ordinary one-way analysis
  of variance followed by Dunnett’s test. For comparison between two internal groups,
  Dunnett’s multiple comparison test was performed. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p
  < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001, ns: non-significant.'
