caption: 'GOLM1 activates the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling
  pathway to promote angiogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma. (a) Gene expression
  correlation network based on GOLM1 as well as pivot and target genes identified
  in the RNAInter database. (b) Pathway map interrelating GOLM1, pivot genes, pathway
  genes, and the VEGF signaling pathway. (c) Network view of GOLM1, pivot genes, target
  genes, and the VEGF pathway. Red represents upregulated gene expression, blue represents
  downregulated gene expression. (d) Molecular docking studies of PTBP1 and E2F4 with
  GOLM1. (e) Schematic of a potential mechanism by which GOLM1 promotes angiogenesis
  in HCC. VEFG: vascular endothelial growth factor.'
