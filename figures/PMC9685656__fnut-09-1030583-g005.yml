caption: Antioxidant activity in the muscle of juvenile softshell turtles fed a gradient
  of dietary supplementary protein levels for 8 weeks. (A) Superoxide dismutase activity
  (SOD) and (B) catalase activity (CAT). (C) Plot presenting the correlation between
  catalase activity (CAT) and protein levels according to the fitted broken-line model.
  The breakpoint is 26.07% protein. (D) Malondialdehyde (MDA). (E) Plot presenting
  the correlation between malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein levels according to the
  fitted broken-line model. The breakpoint is 26.06% protein. (F) Glutathione peroxidase
  activity (GPX). Bars with different letters indicate significant differences among
  the groups (P < 0.05). The values shown are the mean Â± SD for three replicates.

  via the NF-E2-related factor 2/Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 signaling pathway
  in softshell turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis).
