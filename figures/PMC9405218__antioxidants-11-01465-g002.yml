caption: 'Analysis of DEGs profiling: (a) the DEGs between sham versus MI groups and
  ICS II versus MI groups were summarized with a Venn diagram; (b) the DEGs between
  MI versus sham groups and ICS II versus MI groups were summarized with Volcano maps;
  (c) KEGG pathways enriched with DEGs and their matching p-values; (d–f) dot plot
  showed the fold enrichment values for the genes, which were analyzed by significant
  GO terms using p-values.'
