caption: Osteogenic-regulated signaling pathway screening of OGP treatment on hPDLSCs
  toward osteogenic lineage. (A) Schematic experiment of OGP treatment on hPDLSCs
  to evaluate osteogenic-related pathways was indicated. (B) Bone morphogenetic protein
  (BMP), (C) Hedgehog, (D) Notch, (E) transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), and
  (F) Wnt signalings related gene expression were presented. Asterisks beside the
  dot of experimental group on gene expression results indicated the significant difference
  between OM and other groups (p<0.05).
