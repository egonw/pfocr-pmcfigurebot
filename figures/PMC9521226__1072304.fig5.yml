caption: 'TAL1 induces a growth disadvantage in vitro by direct upregulation of apoptosis.
  (A) Plots showing percentage green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive cells in peripheral
  blood, bone marrow, spleen and thymus at time of sacrifice: TAL1-positive vs. empty
  vector cells. P-values were calculated using unpaired t-test. (B) CreER pro-T cells
  were transduced with TAL1-inducible constructs, which were sorted for GFP. Next
  these cells were cultured in presence of 4OH tamoxifen. Successful flipping of the
  construct is seen over time as blue fluorescent protein (BFP) signal increases over
  time. RNA extraction was performed on indicated time points. (C) At 48 hours (h)
  cells were sorted for BFP and expression of TAL1 was confirmed by western blot.
  (D) Representation of the 100 most up- and downregulated genes at 24 h compared
  to 0 h over time. (E) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showing significantly
  positive enrichment of pro-apoptotic genes after TAL1 induction compared to non-treated
  pro-T cells. NES: normalized enrichment score; P: nominal P-value. (F) GSEA showing
  significantly negative enrichment of IL2-STAT5 signaling in TAL1-positive thymus
  cells compared to empty vector (EV) thymus cells. NES: normalized enrichment score;
  P: nominal P-value. (G) Growth curve showing percentage of TAL1-positive (mcherry
  positive) cells over time.'
