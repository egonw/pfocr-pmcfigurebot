caption: 'Identification of LINC00467-related signaling pathways using GSEA. (A) Gene
  differential ranking diagram showing the hierarchical clustering of mRNAs in the
  NC group and siRNA group; (B) GSEA showed that mRNA expression was enriched in the
  p53 signaling pathway; (C) The RNA network of the genes of the p53 signaling pathway
  and their transcription factor in the NC group vs siRNA group. Red color: The genes
  of the p53 signaling pathway in the NC group vs siRNA group. Blue color: The transcription
  factor of the “red” gene. (D) The expression of CCNG1 in the NC group and siRNA
  group was detected using qRT-PCR; (E) Correlation between the p53 pathway genes
  and TGCT grade distribution in the NC group vs siRNA group. **P value<0.01; ***P
  value < 0.001. GSEA: Gene set enrichment analysis; NC: Negative control; siRNA:
  Small interfering RNA; qRT-PCR: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction;
  TGCT: Testicular germ cell tumor.'
