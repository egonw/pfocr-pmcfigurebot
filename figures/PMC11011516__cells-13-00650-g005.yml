caption: Effects of Lys on the differentiation, calcium concentration, and Wnt/Ca2+pathway
  in semimembranosus and semitendinosus SCs. Expressions of MyHC and key proteins
  (myogenin and MRF4) of the myogenic factor family in fast (semimembranosus; a,c)
  and slow (semitendinosus; b,d) muscle SCs detected upon study completion (96 h).
  CaN fluorescence intensity in fast (semimembranosus; e,g) and slow (semitendinosus;
  f,h) muscle SCs. Wnt/Ca2+pathway key proteins (PKC, CaN, CaMKII, and NFATc1) expression
  in fast (semimembranosus; i,k) and slow (semitendinosus; j,l) muscle SCs. Intracellular
  Ca2+ concentration changes within and at 120 s upon Lys restoration in Lys-deficient
  fast (semimembranosus; m) and slow (semitendinosus; n) muscle SCs. * indicates p
  < 0.05, ** indicates p < 0.01, *** indicates p < 0.001.
