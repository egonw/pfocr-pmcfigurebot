caption: 'Effects of PCNP on the autophagy and Wnt/β-cantenin signaling pathway in
  human thyroid cancer cells. a Western blotting analysis for the expression of LC3A/B
  and P62 in TPC-1 and ARO cells. GAPDH was used as the loading control. b The densitometry
  analyses LC3A/B and P62 were performed in TPC-1 and ARO cells, normalized to the
  corresponding GAPDH level. c Western blotting analysis for the expression of Wnt3a,
  p-β-cantenin, β-cantenin, p-GSK-3β and GSK-3β in TPC-1 and ARO cells. GAPDH was
  used as the loading control. d The densitometry analyses of Wnt3a, p-β-cantenin,
  β-cantenin, p-GSK-3β and GSK-3β in TPC-1 and ARO cells, normalized to the corresponding
  GAPDH level. Data are presented as mean ± SEM of three independent experiments;
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 compared with the Mock group; ##P < 0.01 compared with the
  sh-Scb group.'
