caption: Loss of NUP133 remodels the transcriptome of specific regulatory pathways.
  (a) Schematic of the experimental design for transcriptome analysis (RNA sequencing).
  Two replicates per NUP133 genotype and clone were sequenced. (b) Principle component
  analysis (PCA) of transcriptome data (color-coding of dots/clones as in panel).
  (a) Variance of principle component 1 (PC1), mainly depending on the NUP133 genotype
  on both monoclonal backgrounds. (c) Volcano plot of combined differential expression
  (DE) analysis for NUP133 KO-1&2 versus WT-1&2 clones (all 4×WT and 4×KO clones were
  pooled for statistical analysis). Red dots indicate 324 significant (adjusted p-value
  < 0.05 and log2 fold-change (FC) > (abs. ± 1)) regulated transcripts. (d) Heat map
  showing Z-scores for these 324 significantly regulated transcripts, as well as unsupervised
  grouping for all analyzed samples. (e) Expression levels of NUP transcripts are
  not significantly altered (adj. p-value < 0.05 and log2 FC > (abs. ±1)), with the
  exception of NUP133. (f) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for altered reactome
  pathways. Significantly enriched gene sets (GS) (nominal p-value < 0.01 and FRD
  q-value < 0.25) were clustered to a network, based on their overlap of mapped genes.
  (g) Representative GSEA plots of enriched reactome pathway gene sets are shown.
