caption: 'Identification of DEGs in TCs. (a) Volcano plot showing the DEGs within
  the Wnt signaling pathway identified from GSE160633 that demonstrated the expression
  of 87 upregulated genes in the Wnt signaling pathway after differential expression
  analysis by R package “edgeR.” (b, c) Wnt signaling pathway of intrauterine adhesions
  ((b) green colour: significant downregulation genes; red colour: upregulated genes;
  grey colour: no significant expression genes; (c) blue colour indicated that the
  genes were inhibited, and red colour refers to the genes activated). (d) Heatmap
  of cluster analysis for TCs and the control.'
