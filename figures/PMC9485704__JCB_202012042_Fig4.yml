caption: 'MRCKβ and myosin-II control cup morphogenesis and POS internalization. (a–i)
  Inhibition of MRCKβ activity in primary porcine RPE cultures results in defective
  POS-induced apical membrane remodeling with stalled F-actin–based protrusions and
  inhibited phagocytosis as determined by confocal z-sections of porcine primary RPE
  cells stained with Atto647-Phalloidin; POS were labeled with FITC. White dashes
  highlight apical membrane and arrowheads internalized POS (left panels) or extracellular
  POS (right panels). TEM of primary porcine RPE cells using Gold-labeled POS confirmed
  MRCK kinase inhibition using BDP5290 results in an inhibition of phagocytosis. (j–p)
  Knockdown of MRCKβ resulted in similar defects in cup morphogenesis and phagocytosis.
  (q–v) Inhibition of myosin-II motor activity in MRCKβ-depleted cells results in
  identical defects in cup morphogenesis and phagocytosis, confirming that both defects
  are due to a single pathway. Note, heat maps signify F-actin intensity, white and
  green arrowheads highlight the position of POS, and all scale bars represent 10
  μm. The quantifications in d–h are based on n = 3 independent experiments and show
  data points, means ±1SD (top of bar), and the total number of cells. P values were
  derived from t tests. Source data are available for this figure: .'
