figure_title: CD206Hi macrophages and lack of neutrophils and monocytes mediate an
  immunosuppressive TME in RFP regions
caption: Schematic of ZipSeq spatial transcriptomic analysis of mixed-population tumors.
  Composite stitched image of a 200μm-thick live section marked with YFP regions (encircled
  with green lines), RFP regions (red lines) and mixed regions (blue lines) is shown.
  YFP, RFP and mixed regions were illuminated individually to allow for the binding
  of a unique barcode (“zipcode”) to a photocaged oligo-CD45 antibody complex. ZipCode-tagged
  immune cells were analyzed by scRNAseq. (B) Uniform manifold approximation and projection
  (UMAP) representation of zipcode-labeled cells with cluster overlay. n = 3,238 cells,
  nYFP = 1,236, nRFP = 1,318, nMixed = 684. (C) UMAP representation of zipcode-labeled
  cells with zipcode identity overlaid. (D) Abundance of cells belonging to the T
  cell cluster (cluster 9), calculated as percentage of total immune cells in each
  region. (E) Abundance of cells belonging to MHC-IIHi, Arg1Hi and CD206Hi macrophage
  clusters (clusters 1, 2, and 3 respectively), calculated as percentage of total
  immune cells in each region. (F) Percentage of cells belonging to neutrophil cluster
  (cluster 7) in each region and pathway analysis showing the gene families enriched
  in the neutrophil cluster based on the top 250 differentially expressed genes. (G)
  Percentage of cells belonging to monocyte cluster (cluster 6) and pathway analysis
  of genes enriched in the monocyte cluster based on the top 31 differentially expressed
  genes.
