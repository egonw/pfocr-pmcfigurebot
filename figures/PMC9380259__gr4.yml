caption: The selinexor responses in the AML ex vivo model and cell lines show common
  and unique signaling responses(A) List of phosphorylation sites with a functional
  score >0.6 commonly regulated between ex vivo analysis and AML cell lines. The list
  highlights known regulatory site functions based on information obtained from Perseus
  software. Asterisk (∗) indicates shared phosphorylation sites between response groups.(B)
  Hierarchical clustering of significantly regulated proteins (n = 504; FDR = 0.01,
  s0 = 0.1) between selinexor-sensitive (blue color) and -resistant (red color) cells.
  KEGG pathway overrepresentation with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR-corrected p values for
  cluster 1 and 2.(C) Heatmap of median log2-transformed label-free quantification
  (LFQ) intensities for a selection of regulated proteins belonging to FOXO3/mTOR
  signaling from (B) and include the top five most regulated proteins in (A). Arrows
  indicate the phosphorylation site (p-site) regulation directionality in (A) and
  blue/red colored text refers to the selinexor response group. Asterisk (∗) indicates
  housekeeping genes.(D) Western blot analysis (upper) and quantification (lower)
  of FOXO3, AKT, and p53 in AML cells. Data in bar graph represent mean ± SD (n =
  3). See also ; , , and .
