caption: The modulation of trophoblast invasion and migration by miR21 is dependent
  on phosphorylation of LATS1 or YAP(A) Representative UMAP for six samples. FB, fibroblasts;
  DCs, dendritic cells; NK cells, natural killer cells; CTBs, cytotrophoblasts; DSCs,
  decidual stromal cells; EVT, extravillous trophoblast; SMCs, smooth muscle cells;
  EC, endothelial cell; STB, syncytiotrophoblast. (B) Violin plots for LATS1 (upper)
  and YAP1 (lower) in different cell types of trophoblasts. FLAG-LATS1T1079A/S909A
  cells and Myc-YAP-5SA cells were transfected with mimic NC (NC), inhibitor NC (in
  NC), miR21 mimic (mimic), or miR21 inhibitor (inhibitor) for 6 h and then cultured
  in fresh medium for 48 h before any treatments and measurements. A blank control
  was included. Western blotting of p-LATS1Thr1079, LATS1, p-YAPSer127, and YAP in
  (C) FLAG-LATS1T1079A/S909A cells and (D) Myc-YAP-5SA cells. Western blotting of
  YAP in the cytoplasm and nuclei of (E) FLAG-LATS1T1079A/S909A cells and (F) Myc-YAP-5SA
  cells. (G) Matrigel Transwell assay (scale bar, 400 μm) and (H) wound-healing assay
  (scale bar, 100 μm) of FLAG-LATS1T1079A/S909A cells. (I) Matrigel Transwell assay
  (scale bar, 400 μm) and (J) wound-healing assay (scale bar, 100 μm) of Myc-YAP-5SA
  cells; one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison test; ns, nonsignificant. The
  data are presented as the means ± SEMs.
