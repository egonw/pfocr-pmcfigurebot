caption: PD-1/PD-L1 axis affects Tregs and Teffs through different mechanisms. NOTCH
  pathway activation and AEP inactivation induce Tregs immunosuppressive activity.
  Downregulation of AKT, mTOR, ERK2, and upregulation of PTEN mediates the conversion
  of the naïve CD4+ T cells into Tregs. Moreover, blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 interaction
  can increase Teffs proliferation and restore their secretory function. AEP, asparaginyl
  endopeptidase; Akt, cellular homolog of murine thymoma virus Akt8 oncogene; anti-PD-1/PD-L1
  Ab, anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody; ERK2, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 2; mTOR,
  mammalian target of rapamycin; PD-1, programmed cell death; PD-L1, programmed cell
  death ligand; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10; Teff,
  effector T cell; TIL, tumor-infiltrated T cell; Treg, regulatory T cell.
