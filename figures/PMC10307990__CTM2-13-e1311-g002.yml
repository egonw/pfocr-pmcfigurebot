caption: Experimental and functional validation of SCD and MTHFD2 genes. Dose–response
  curves and IC50s for (A) DS18561882 drug and (B) A939572 drug to five AML cell lines
  (U937, MOLM‐14, THP‐1, KG‐1 and HL‐60) and one normal cell line (HCC1954‐BL) by
  CCK‐8 assay. The drugs were treated for 48 h. (C) Volcano plots for PUFAs and UFAs
  in the 5 AML cell lines identical to (A) and (B). The x‐axis refers to the Pearson
  correlation coefficient calculated by correlating gene expression of five AML cell
  lines in Depmap with measured PUFAs or UFAs by NMR for the genes only in the ‘UFA_Synthesis’
  pathway. The y‐axis refers to the p value of the Pearson correlation coefficient.
  Nonsignificant (p value .05 or higher) genes are indicated in grey. Combination
  index plots for THP‐1 cell line for the combination of cytarabine with (D) A939572
  or (E) DS18561882. Combination index plots for KG‐1 cell line for the combination
  of cytarabine with (F) A939572 or (G) DS18561882. For (D)–(G), the combination index
  of less than 1 indicates synergy and Fa refers to fractions affected by particular
  dose of a drug, herein the fraction of dead cells compared to nontreated samples.
