caption: 'Metabolism of carbohydrates and related metabolic pathways of L. fermentum.
  (A) Schematic representation of CAZy in the metabolic pathway of the 224 L. fermentum
  strains. The solid lines indicate that more than 220 L. fermentum strains contained
  the enzyme. The dotted lines meant that the enzyme was present in fewer than 220
  L. fermentum strains and the number of strains containing the enzyme is denoted
  by the dotted line; (B) number of genes encoding the enzymes (L-arabinose isomerase
  [EC: 5.3.1.4], araA; L-ribulose-5-phosphate 4-epimerase [EC: 5.1.3.4], araD; beta-glucosidase
  [EC: 3.2.1.21], bglX; oligo-1,6-glucosidase [EC: 3.2.1.10], malL; beta-galactosidase
  [EC: 3.2.1.23], lacZ; xylose isomerase [EC: 5.3.1.5], XylA; deoxyribose-phosphate
  aldolasebeta-glucosidase [EC: 4.1.2.4], deoC; phosphopentomutase [EC: 5.4.2.7],
  deoB) in the genome of L. fermentum strains from different sources.'
