caption: α-Cyperone mitigated OGD-induced cardiomyocyte inflammation and oxidative
  stress. Cardiomyocytes were treated with different concentrations (15, 30, and 60 μM)
  of α-cyperone for 24 hours after OGD induction. (a) The profiles of inflammatory
  cytokines were assessed by qRT-PCR. (b) The expression of inflammatory response
  proteins was examined by WB. (c) The MDA content and (d) SOD activity were evaluated
  by colorimetry. (e) ROS production was determined with the ROS detection kit. All
  experiments were repeated three times and data were expressed as mean ± SD; ∗∗∗P
  < 0.001 (vs. CON), ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001. &P < 0.05 (vs. OGD), &&P < 0.01, and &&&P < 0.001.
