caption: Molecular mechanisms of estrogen-induced tumor regression. (1) Extrinsic
  death receptor pathway involving FasR-FasL is one of the mechanisms by which estrogen
  induces apoptosis in LTED breast cancer. (2) E2 rapidly induces endoplasmic reticulum
  stress and UPR sensors IRE1a, ATF-6 and PERK. (3) UPR-inducer PERK activates NF-ÎºB,
  which further participates in apoptosis mediated by downstream TNF family member-associated
  inflammatory proteins in response to E2 treatment in LTED models. (4) Oxidative-stress-induced
  mitochondrial damage caused by E2 results in apoptosis by increasing the expression
  of pro-apoptotic proteins and by decreasing the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins.
