caption: Effect of EA on MAPK signaling in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. (A)
  Heatmap showing differential gene expression in HCCLM3 cells with or without 28
  µM EA treatment for 48 h. (B) KEGG analysis of genes in HCCLM3 cells. The top 10
  KEGG pathways based on fold enrichment are shown. The arrow indicates the 'MAPK
  signaling pathway'. (C) Western blot analysis of the expression levels of MAPK-related
  protein at 48 h in MHCC97-L and HCCLM3 cells. β-actin was used as a control. (D)
  Viability of MHCC97-L and HCCLM3 cells treated with or without an ERK inhibitor
  was measured by Cell Counting Kit 8 assay. n=6. (E and F) Migratory ability of MHCC97-L
  and HCCLM3 cells treated with or without an ERK inhibitor, as measured by Transwell
  migration assays after EA treatment. All data are shown as the mean ± SD. ***P<0.001.
