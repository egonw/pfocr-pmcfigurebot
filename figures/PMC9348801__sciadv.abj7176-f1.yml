figure_title: Summary of the top significantly enriched pathways (adjusted P < 0.1)
  by the genes whose conservation scores are correlated with cancer resistance estimates
  (MLCAW), using GSEA with gene set annotations from the Reactome database
caption: The cancer resistance estimate used is “maximum longevity controlled for
  adult weight” (MLCAW). Normalized enrichment score is plotted on the y axis, where
  positive values correspond to enrichment by the PC genes and negative values correspond
  to enrichment by the NC genes. The dot color represents the significance of the
  enrichment (negative log10 GSEA P value), and the dot size represents the number
  of genes in the “leading edge,” i.e., the set of genes that are enriched in a pathway.
  For the sake of clarity, only a subset of the enriched pathways (FDR < 0.1) are
  shown, and long pathway names have been shortened (using “…”). The complete pathway
  enrichment results are given in table S3B.
