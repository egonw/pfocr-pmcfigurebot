caption: RICTOR deficiency exerts differential effects on mitochondrial fitness in
  hESCs, hMSCs and hNSCs. (A) GO and pathway enrichment analysis of differentially
  expressed genes in RICTOR+/+ and RICTOR−/− hESCs. (B) Representative quantifications
  of extracellular acidification rates (ECAR) of RICTOR+/+ and RICTOR−/− hESCs. Data
  are presented as mean ± SEM of three biological repeats. ***P < 0.001. (C) Representative
  transmission electron microscopy images of RICTOR+/+ and RICTOR−/− hESCs. Scale
  bars, 2 μm and 200 nm (zoomed-in image). (D) Flow cytometric analysis of mitochondrial
  mass in hESCs. Data are presented as mean ± SEM of three independent experiments.
  ***P < 0.001. (E) Cellular oxygen consumption rates (OCR) of RICTOR+/+ and RICTOR−/−
  hESCs in response to indicated mitochondrial modulators. Data are presented as mean
  ± SEM of three biological repeats. ns, not significant, **P < 0.01. (F) Representative
  quantifications of extracellular acidification rates (ECAR) of RICTOR+/+ and RICTOR−/−
  hMSCs (passage 4). Data are presented as mean ± SEM of three biological repeats.
  ***P < 0.001. (G) Representative transmission electron microscopy images of RICTOR+/+
  and RICTOR−/− hMSCs (passage 4). Scale bars, 2 μm and 200 nm (zoomed-in image).
  (H) Flow cytometric analysis of mitochondrial mass in hMSCs (passage 4). Data are
  presented as mean ± SEM of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05. (I) Cellular
  oxygen consumption rates (OCR) of RICTOR+/+ and RICTOR−/− hMSCs (passage 4) in response
  to indicated mitochondrial modulators. Data are presented as mean ± SEM of four
  biological repeats. *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001. (J) Representative quantifications
  of extracellular acidification rates (ECAR) of RICTOR+/+ and RICTOR−/− hNSCs (passage
  5). Data are presented as mean ± SEM of three biological repeats. ns, not significant.
  (K) Representative transmission electron microscopy images of RICTOR+/+ and RICTOR−/−
  hNSCs (passage 5). Scale bars, 1 μm and 200 nm (zoomed-in image). (L) Flow cytometric
  analysis of mitochondrial mass in hNSCs (passage 5). Data are presented as mean
  ± SEM of three independent experiments. ns, not significant. (M) Cellular oxygen
  consumption rates (OCR) of RICTOR+/+ and RICTOR−/− hNSCs (passage 5) in response
  to indicated mitochondrial modulators. Data are presented as mean ± SEM of three
  biological repeats. ns, not significant
