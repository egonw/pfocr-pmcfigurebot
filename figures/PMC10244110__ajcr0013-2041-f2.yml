caption: 'Simvastatin downregulates YAP/TAZ expressions via the JNK pathway. A. Simvastatin
  treatment suppressed YAP/TAZ expressions with stress-activated p38 MAPKs and JNKs
  compared to controls in pancreatic cancer cell lines (MIA PaCa-2 > PK-8 cells) at
  48 h, whereas Pravastatin did not show such the significant downregulation. Medium
  with statin changed every 24 h. β-actin protein expression served as a loading control.
  Representative blots are shown. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01. B. JNK inhibitor attenuated
  the YAP/TAZ down-regulation and diminished cleaved Capase-3 and cleaved PARP expressions
  induced by Simvastatin treatment. JNK inhibitor (SP600125, abcom: ab120065) (30
  μM) was added to the medium 2 h before simvastatin treatment. β-actin protein expression
  was used as the loading control. The representative blots are shown. C. p38 inhibitor
  addition to simvastatin did not affect YAP/TAZ downregulation by simvastatin and
  failed to diminished cleaved Capase-3 and cleaved PARP expression. p-38 inhibitor
  (SB 203580, abcom: ab120162) (20 μM) was added to the medium 2 h before adding simvastatin.
  β-actin protein expression was used as the loading control. Representative blots
  are shown. D. JNK inhibitor hindered the simvastatin-derived anti-growth effect
  in MIA PaCa-2 cells. Medium containing simvastatin (2.5 μM) and JNK inhibitor (30
  μM) was changed every 24 h. E. Simvastatin treatment with oxaliplatin enhances the
  anti-growth effects in MIA-PaCa-2 cells. The medium containing simvastatin (2.5
  μM) and oxaliplatin (2.5 μM) was changed every 24 h.'
