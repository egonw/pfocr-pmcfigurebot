caption: 'KEGG pathways enriched by predicted target genes of candidate miRNA markers.
  In addition to the cancer-related pathways such as pathways in cancer, PC, and various
  signaling pathways, DM-related pathways such as insulin resistance, type 2 DM, PI3K-Akt
  signaling pathway, FoxO signaling pathway, and AGE-RAGE signaling pathways in diabetic
  complications showed higher significance. Acronyms: KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of
  Genes and Genomes; miRNA, microRNA; PC, pancreatic cancer; DM, diabetes mellitus.'
