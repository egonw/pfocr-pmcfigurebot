caption: Protective role of OLNZ on gene expression of complement components in the
  hippocampus during transient-ischemia (TI)-induced stroke in gerbils. In TI-induced
  stroke, gene expression of C1q, C2, C3, C4a, and C9, was significantly upregulated,
  whereas treatment with OLNZ markedly downregulated the expression of these genes.
  Data were expressed as the mean ± SEM, n = 3 in each group. After performing a one-way
  ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test, p < 0.05 for comparisons of treatment groups with
  the sham group (#) and p < 0.05 for comparisons with the stroke group (*) were considered
  significant.
