caption: IRS/PI3K/AKT expression of insulin signaling pathway in placentas tissues.
  The expression of proteins in insulin signaling in placental tissue from women with
  gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and in that of healthy controls (HCs) as determined
  by western blotting. (A) Representative images of IRS, PI3K, AKT, and GLUT4 expression
  in placental tissues of the two groups. (B) Semi‐quantitative analysis of protein
  expression. Student's t test, *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001. The IRS protein detected
  is the IRS1 subtype and the PI3K protein is the p85‐Y607 subtype
article_title: The downregulation of miR‐22 and miR‐372 may contribute to gestational
  diabetes mellitus through regulating glucose metabolism via the PI3K/AKT/GLUT4 pathway.
