caption: 'Molecular mechanism of cancer: Schematic drawing of “Molecular Mechanism
  of Cancer” obtained by ingenuity canonical pathway analysis of PRELP−/− mouse retina.
  Loss of PRELP activated the majority of cancer pathways in the mouse retina. Red
  = upregulated; green = downregulated; orange = predicted upregulation; blue = predicted
  downregulation.'
