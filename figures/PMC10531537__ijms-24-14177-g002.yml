caption: Multitarget neuroprotective potential of Licochalcone A. Lico-A has the potential
  to exert a neuroprotective effect through a variety of mechanisms. It not only enhances
  cognitive activity via the BDNF-TrkB pathway but also displays antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
  properties by inhibiting microglia activation, thereby mitigating neuroinflammation.
  Furthermore, as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, Lico-A contributes to elevated
  levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the brain. Additionally, it plays
  a role in reducing the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs),
  further demonstrating its multifaceted approach to neuroprotection.
