caption: 'Highlight of reactions in Purine Synthesis (OAT1, Table ) and Bile Acid
  Synthesis (OAT3, Table ). Purine Synthesis: Reactions in the Purine Synthesis pathway
  that are not present in OAT1 WT models but are present in OAT1 KO are outlined.
  Fold change ratios of particular metabolites that were increased in OAT1 KO are
  presented next to their 3D bond-line molecular structures and include adenine, inosine,
  and IMP. Bile Acid Synthesis: A subset of the reactions that are present in the
  OAT3 knockout, but not the WT, are highlighted. Since the plasma concentration of
  choline is significantly higher in the OAT3 knockouts, the model pathways directly
  involving choline and choline-phospholipids were not increased (gray-shaded/opacified
  pathway at the base of the figure). Consistent with experimental data, however,
  pathways and metabolites with more complex, ring containing structures were identified
  in the OAT3 KO, including xoltetrol_m (3α,7α,12α,26-Tetrahydroxy-5β-cholestane)
  and thcholst_m (3α, 7α, 12α-Trihydroxy-5β-cholestan-26-al).'

  and gut microbiome as revealed by contextualized metabolic network reconstructions.
