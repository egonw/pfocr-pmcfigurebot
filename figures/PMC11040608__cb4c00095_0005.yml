caption: 'Nitrite, but not nitrate, induces α-syn aggregation in enteroendocrine STC-1
  cells. α-Syn aggregates per STC-1 cell upon incubation with nitrate (NO3–) or nitrite
  (NO2–) were (a) visualized (representative images) and (b) quantified using maximum
  intensity projections acquired by structured illumination microscopy (immunofluorescence
  staining of α-syn aggregates is shown in green; DAPI-stained cell nuclei are shown
  in blue). n = 3 independent biological replicates, 3–4 technical replicates for
  each; bars denote mean ± S.E.M.; significance determined by unpaired t-test; and
  *: P = 0.0113; ****: P < 0.0001, ns: not significant.'
