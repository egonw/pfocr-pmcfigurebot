caption: 'Protective effects of APG on HCC. The combination of APG and ADM reverses
  the drug-resistant phenotype through various pathways. The combination of sorafenib
  and APG can reduce cell viability, induce apoptosis, and reduce the ability of cancer
  cells to migrate and invade. The combination of APG and paclitaxel inhibits the
  expression of HIF-1a and reverses the drug resistance induced by hypoxia. As a signal,
  APG can reduce the expression of Snai1 and NF-κB, reverse the elevation of EMT,
  increase cell adhesion, and inhibit the invasion and migration of HCC cells. APG
  downregulates H19 expression to inhibit the growth of liver cancer cells, inducing
  inactivation of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. ADM: Adriamycin,
  APG: Apigenin, EMT: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition, HCC: Hepatocellular carcinoma.'
