caption: 'Validation for the discrepant expression levels of 5′transfer RNA halves.
  A: Heatmap of the expression levels of six differently expressed 5′transfer RNA
  halves (tiRNAs) in sessile serrated lesions (SSLs) vs normal control (NC). B: Volcano
  chart of transfer RNA-related fragments (tRFs) and tiRNAs. Red/blue circles indicate
  statistically significant differentially expressed tRFs and tiRNAs with the absolute
  log2 (fold change) of no < 1.5 and a P value ≤ 0.05 (red: Upregulated; blue: Downregulated).
  Gray circles indicate nondifferentially expressed tRFs and tiRNAs, with fold changes
  and/or P values not meeting the cutoff thresholds. C-G: qRT-polymerase chain reaction
  for the validation of five upregulated 5′tiRNAs in 16 paired SSLs and NC tissues.
  All data were analyzed using paired Student′s t-test. The asterisk indicates a significant
  difference between the two groups (aP < 0.05, bP < 0.01, cP < 0.001). NS: Not significant;
  SSLs: Sessile serrated lesions; NC: Normal control; tRF: Transfer RNA-related fragment;
  tiRNA: Transfer RNA halves.'
