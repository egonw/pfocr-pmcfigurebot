caption: Gypenosides inhibited the proliferation and induced apoptosis of bladder
  cancer cells. (a) Cells were treated with gypenosides for 48 h, and a CCK8 assay
  was employed to assess viability. Errors bars show the standard deviation (SD) of
  the mean of three independent tests. (b) Five hundred cells were plated in a 6-well
  plate for eight days and treated with gypenosides or DMSO. (c) Quantification of
  colony formation assays. Student's t-test, Error bars show the SD of the mean for
  three replicate wells, ∗P < 0.05. (d) Flow cytometry was employed to analyze the
  staining of propidium iodide (PI) and annexin V in control or gypenoside-treated
  cells. (e) Quantification of the apoptosis ratio. Student's t-test, mean ± SD are
  given, ∗P < 0.05. (f) Western blot experiments indicating the expression levels
  of Bax, Bcl2, and Caspase 9 in the cells treated with DMSO or gypenosides. (g) The
  Bax/Bcl2 ratio was quantified by ImageJ. Student's t-test, mean ± SD are given,
  ∗P < 0.05. (h and i) The relative proportion of cell cycle phases in T24 cells treated
  with DMSO or gypenosides. Mean ± SD are given, n.s., no significant variation, ∗P
  < 0.05. (j and k) The relative proportion of cell cycle phases in 5637 cells treated
  with DMSO or gypenosides. Mean ± SD are given, n.s., no significant variation, ∗P
  < 0.05. (l) Immunoblot analysis of the expression of CDK2, CDK4, and Cyclin D1 quantified
  by ImageJ.
