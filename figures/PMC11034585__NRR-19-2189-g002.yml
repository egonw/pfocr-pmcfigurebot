caption: Metabolic reprogramming of T-cells during the activation process.Na√Øve T-cells
  are characterized by low energetic requirements which are maintained by oxidative
  phosphorylation (OXPHOS). After activation, effector T-cells show an increase in
  the glycolytic pathway, providing energy for a rapid proliferation. Fatty acid synthesis
  (FAS) and glutaminolysis are also increased for building blocks. Finally, memory
  T-cells rely on OXPHOS and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) for long-term survival activities
  and recall responses. Created with Adobe Illustrator version 27.
