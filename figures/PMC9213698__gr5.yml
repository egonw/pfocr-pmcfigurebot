caption: Signaling pathway blocking assays. The drugs MK-2206 (S1078, Selleck Chemicals,
  Houston, TX, USA), rapamycin (S1039, Selleck Chemicals) and dorsomorphin (S7306,
  Selleck Chemicals) were used for the specific blocking of Akt, mTOR and AMPK activity,
  respectively. Goat mammary epithelial cells were treated with basic medium containing
  glucose at high (4.5 g/L) or low (1 g/L) levels and were incubated with dimethyl
  sulfoxide (DMSO; control group), MK-2206 (500 nM), rapamycin (10 nM) or dorsomorphin
  (10 μM) for 24 h. (A) The expression of FASN. (B) Expression of ChREBP. Values are
  means ± standard error of means. ∗P < 0.05. ∗∗∗P < 0.001. AMPK = mammalian AMP-activated
  protein kinase; Akt = AKT serine/threonine kinase 1; ChREBP = carbohydrate response
  element binding protein; FASN = fatty acid synthase; mTOR = mechanistic target of
  rapamycin kinase.
