caption: Effects of ADAMTS16 expression on GC cell and growth in vitro and in vivo.
  (A–D) Representative colony formation assay images and quantitative analysis of
  cell proliferation. (E,F) Flow cytometry showed that ADAMTS16 expression in GC cell
  lines induced G2/M phase arrest. (G,H) Flow cytometry was used to reveal the effects
  of ADAMTS16 expression on GC cell apoptosis arrest. (I–K) Effect of ADAMTS16 expression
  on tumor growth in nude mice and representative immunohistochemistry images of ADAMTS16,
  Ki67 and TUNEL in tumor tissues. Scale bar, 50 µm. The data are shown as means ±
  standard deviations. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001. ns,
  not significant.
