caption: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) share common outgoing communication
  patterns for the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and focal adhesion in malignant effusions
  from ovarian cancer patients. Outgoing patterns for signaling A, cell B, and communication
  C of multiple cell types in malignant abdominal fluids of ovarian cancer patients
  obtained with CellChat [] from scRNA-seq data []. The asterisks in C indicate pathways
  not associated with CAFs and epithelial cells communication (pattern 1, cluster
  2). This communication pattern 1 (cluster 2) was used to identify pathways for gene
  sets of CAFs ligands D and epithelial cell receptors E for these ligands. In both
  D and E, the focal adhesion and PI3K-AKT-mTOR are among the top altered pathways.
  The top 10 pathway terms (lowest adjusted P-value) were selected from WikiPathways
  2021 and MSigDB Hallmark 2020 libraries available in EnrichR [, ]
