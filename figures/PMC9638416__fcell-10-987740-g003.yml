caption: Gene ontology and signalling pathway analysis. (A,B). Manhattan plots showing
  enrichment of GO terms, KEGG signalling pathways, Reactome and miRNA targets by
  upregulated (A) and downregulated DEGs (B) (Padj < 0.05). (C,D). GO enrichment with
  upregulated (C) and downregulated DEGs (D) (Padj < 0.05). Selected top 20 GO terms
  are presented. (E,F). KEGG signalling pathway enrichment with upregulated (E) and
  downregulated DEGs (F) (Padj < 0.05).
