caption: Effect of caffeine on steatosis markers and ultrastructure anatomy of hepatic
  tissue from the NASH model. (A) ORO staining of hepatic tissues from rats in the
  control, HFSCD+CCl4, HFSCD+CCl4+caffeine, and caffeine groups. Scale bar = 20 μm.
  (B) Transmission electron micrographs of hepatic sections. Scale bar = 2 μm. (Arrow)
  mitochondria, (CF) collagen fibers, (IC) inflammatory cell, (LD) lipid drop, (N)
  nucleus. (C) Percentage of labeled area stained with ORO. Bars represent the mean
  of experiments performed in duplicate ± SEM (n = 4), liver triglycerides, and cholesterol.
  Bars represent the mean of experiments performed in duplicate ± SEM (n = 5). (D)
  Western blot analysis of precursor-sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1C
  (pre-SREBP1C), active-SREBP1C (act-SREBP1C), and peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptors alpha (PPAR-α) proteins. Bars represent the mean of experiments performed
  in duplicate ± SEM (n = 3); β-actin was used as a loading control. (a) p < 0.05
  compared with the control group.
