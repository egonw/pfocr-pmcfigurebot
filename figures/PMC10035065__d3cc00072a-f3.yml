figure_title: (a) Comparison of the formation energies for a range of imine intermediates
  on the pathway to the formation of CC1 (EDA), CC3 (CHDA), CC13 (MPDA), and CC21
  (DMHDA). Data is coloured based on the inset amines. (b) Comparison of the formation
  energies for the aminal (pink crosses) and imine (pink circles) intermediates identified
  during the formation of CC21
