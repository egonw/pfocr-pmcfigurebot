caption: Signaling pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs between ADC and SCC patients
  performed with the WebGestalt platform. (A) Enriched pathways in the KEGG database
  analysis. (B) Enriched pathways in the WikiPathways database analysis. (C) Enriched
  pathways in the Reactome database analysis. The size of the dots represents the
  number of DEGs in the pathway, while the dot color represents the significance of
  the analysis, where red shows a more significantly enriched pathway.
