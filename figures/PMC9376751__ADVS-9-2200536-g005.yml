caption: 'Enhancer state regions are associated with selectively activation of NF‐κB
  target genes. A) The heatmap (left) shows the gene expression regulated by NF‐κB
  signal pathway at five time points. Correlations between dynamic gene expression
  and the corresponding H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and H3K4me3 signals (RPM, gene body ± 10–100 kb)
  (right panel) were calculated, respectively. Genes reported to be involved in CRC
  were marked in blue. B–G) Gene expressions of representative genes for each cluster
  (B,D,F), and the corresponding gene expression in TCGA database (C,E,G). H) The
  UCSC browser view shows H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and H3K4me3 enrichment on Cxcl family
  locus. I) The UCSC browser view for H3K27ac enrichment of 3 pairs of normal and
  colon tumor patient tissues around CXCL family locus. An unpaired student''s t test
  was used. ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.0001, ns: no significance.'
