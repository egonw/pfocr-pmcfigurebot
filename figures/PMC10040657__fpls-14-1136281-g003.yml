caption: Effect of light treatment on the expression of early flavonoids biosynthetic
  genes (A) and late flavonoids biosynthetic genes (B) in ‘Zill’ mango peel. Each
  value represents the mean ± standard deviation of three biological replicates. *
  indicates significant difference (p-value < 0.05), and ** indicates very significant
  difference (p-value < 0.01) between control and treatment, as determined by Student’s
  t-test.
article_title: Postharvest light-induced flavonoids accumulation in mango (Mangifera
  indica L.) peel is associated with the up-regulation of flavonoids-related and light
  signal pathway genes.
