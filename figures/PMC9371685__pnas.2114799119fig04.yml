caption: 'Proposed central carbon and energy metabolism in strain HY1 and differential
  protein abundance between methane-grown and thiosulfate-grown cells. The color scale
  indicates whether proteins have higher abundance in methane-grown (red) or thiosulfate-grown
  (blue) cells. The intensity of the color in each protein indicates the relative
  fold change difference (log2FC). Methane oxidation: Methane is oxidized to methanol
  by the soluble methane monooxygenase, sMMO (MHY1_02902–2908). The produced methanol
  is oxidized to formaldehyde via the lanthanide-dependent MDH, XoxF (MHY1_02202 was
  the most abundant MDH). Formaldehyde oxidation to formate then proceeds via the
  tetrahydromethanopterin (H4MPT) pathway, and C1 incorporation into the serine cycle
  is mediated by the tetrahydrofolate (H4F) carbon-assimilation pathway. Sulfur oxidation:
  In the periplasm, two thiosulfate molecules are oxidized to tetrathionate by thiosulfate
  dehydrogenase, DoxDA (MHY1_01298), and then TetH (MHY1_02468) hydrolyzes tetrathionate
  to sulfate and disulfane monosulfonic acid, which most probably decomposes spontaneously
  to thiosulfate and sulfur. Sulfane sulfur derived from thiosulfate and sulfide via
  SoxYZAB (MHY1_00063–66) and Sqr (MHY1_02376), respectively, is transported into
  the cytoplasm via PmpAB (MHY1_00234–235 and MHY1_01361–1362; only MHY1_01361–1362
  are indicated here), then transferred to the DsrEFH (MHY1_00081–83) and DsrC (MHY1_00084)
  via the sulfur-transporting complex [rhodanese (MHY1_01281)-TusA (MHY1_00072)-DsrE2A
  (MHY1_00073)]. The persulfurated DsrC is oxidized to DsrC and sulfite by DsrAB sulfite
  reductase (MHY1_00079–80), thereby releasing electrons to the iron–sulfur flavoprotein,
  DsrL (MHY1_00087). Sulfite is probably transported to the periplasm by a TauE-like
  exporter (MHY1_01299). The sulfite:cytochrome c oxidoreductase, SorAB (MHY1_p00095–0096),
  encoded in the megaplasmid, might be involved in sulfite oxidation. It is speculated
  that the TauD/DsrQ protein (MHY1_00078) catalyzes the release of sulfite during
  the breakdown of sulfonates.'
