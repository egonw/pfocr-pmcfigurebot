caption: The analysis of fecal microbiota between the AOM/DSS + CBM group (AOM/CBM)
  and AOM/DSS group (AOM/DSS). (A) PCoA analysis revealed different Î² diversity between
  the two groups. (B) The heatmap showed different microbial compositions between
  the two groups. (C) F/B ratio showed the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes between
  the two groups. (D) Venn diagram and (E) ANCOM results revealed different microbial
  compositions and abundances between the two groups. (F,G) Aerobic and anaerobic
  expressions of fecal microbiota between the two groups. (H) Cladogram and (I) LDA
  score selected different and predominant bacteria between the two groups. (J) The
  fecal microbial composition in AOM/DSS + CBM group showed more potentially pathogenic
  than that in AOM/DSS group. (K) The expression of each metabolic pathway in the
  microbiomes from the two groups.
