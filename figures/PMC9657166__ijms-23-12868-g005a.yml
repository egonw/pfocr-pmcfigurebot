caption: Signaling pathways involved in circTCF4-related differentiation of MuSCs.
  (A) CircTCF4 expression after circTCF4 interference. (B) Heat map of correlation
  between samples. (C) Volcano map of differentially expressed genes. (D) Heat map
  of differentially expressed genes. (E) GO enrichment of down-regulated mRNA host
  genes. (F) KEGG signaling pathway of up-regulated mRNA host genes. (G) Gene set
  enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes. (H) Protein-protein interaction
  networks of differentially expressed genes involved in the MuSCs differentiation.
  Data are means Â± standard error from at least three biological replicates, * p <
  0.05.
