caption: 'Metabolic changes associated with hypertension comorbid OSA. (A) Heat map
  of the datasets of differential metabolites, indicating that the expressed trends
  of most differential metabolites that distinguished patients with hypertension comorbid
  OSA from non-OSA hypertensive patients were similar in the discovery and validation
  sets. (B) Regression analysis plot depicting the association of each metabolite
  and OSA condition; positive or negative Î²-coefficient values indicate a positive
  or negative correlation between metabolites and OSA condition, FDR-adjusted p <
  0.05 was considered as significant threshold, n.s. represents no significance. a
  and b indicates if the metabolites are annotated by chemical-standards or not. Model
  1: Univariate regression analysis; Model 2: Adjustments for changed clinical variables
  and commonly known metabolic factors, including ages, sex, BMI, neck circumference,
  waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, night-time SBP, night-time
  DBP, TC, HDL-C. C Pathway enrichment analysis of the differentiated metabolites
  by using MetaboAnalyst.'
