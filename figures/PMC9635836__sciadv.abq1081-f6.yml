caption: (A) Comparison of up-regulated pathways in all retinal cell types of KO and
  Glia-KO mice at 12 mo. Most up-regulated pathways were shared between KO and Glia-KO
  mice. (B) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified that the inflammatory pathway was
  one of the most common disease-related pathways between KO and Glia-KO mice, including
  cytokine/chemokine signaling and immune cell responses. (C) Uniform Manifold Approximation
  and Projection visualization of the transcriptional heterogeneity of 62,479 retinal
  cells from 12-mo WT and KO mice. Clusters are colored according to cell type. (D)
  Dot plot showing gene combinations (column) uniquely indicating cell clusters (row).
  (E) Venn diagram of up-regulated pathways in KO mice. (F and G) Pathways up-regulated
  (F) selectively in astrocytes and (G) in both RGCs and astrocytes. (H to J) CXCL12
  was up-regulated in astrocytes of 12-mo Glia-KO mice. (I) CXCL12 signals colocalized
  with GFAP signals in Glia-KO mice. (J) The signal intensity of CXCL12 was increased
  by approximately 3.5-fold in astrocytes (n = 5 eyes, **P < 0.01, Mann-Whitney U
  test). (K) CXCL12 was also up-regulated in cultured ON KO astrocytes. (L to N) CCL5
  signals colocalized with GFAP signals in both 12-mo Ctr and Glia-KO mice. (N) The
  signal intensity of CCL5 in astrocytes was threefold higher in Glia-KO mice (n =
  5 eyes, **P < 0.01, Mann-Whitney U test). (O) CCL5 was also up-regulated in cultured
  ON KO astrocytes. (P and Q) CXCR4 and CCR5 were expressed in Rbpms+ RGCs regardless
  of genotype (i.e., Ctr or Glia-KO). Data represent means Â± SEM.
