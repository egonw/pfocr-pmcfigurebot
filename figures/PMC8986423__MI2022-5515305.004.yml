caption: Expression of the NLRC subfamily and the downstream NF-κB signaling pathway
  was analyzed by Western blots in kidney tissues from diabetic minipigs. (a) Detection
  of NLRC subfamily members' expression by Western blots and semiquantitative analysis
  of the expression levels of the NLRC subfamily members. (b) Detection of the NF-κB
  signaling pathway by Western blots and semiquantitative analysis of the expression
  levels of the NF-κB signaling pathway. (c) Detection of inflammatory factor (TNF-α
  and IL-6) expression by Western blots and semiquantitative analysis of the expression
  levels of inflammatory factors (TNF-α and IL-6). Protein expression data are presented
  as the means ± SD. ∗P < 0.05 versus CON.
