caption: Evaluation of strain SQ3‐4 as the chassis for other terpene synthesis. (A)
  Relative transcription level of β‐caryophyllene synthase gene QHS1 (12 h cultures).
  (B) Comparison of β‐caryophyllene titre and squalene titre among various strains.
  Yeast cells were cultivated in YPD containing yeast extract YE‐N at 30°C and 200 rpm
  for 48 h. Data are presented as the means of three biological replicates. Error
  bars represent standard deviations (n = 3). For significance analysis, strains SQ‐3
  and SQ3‐4 were used as the controls respectively. Student’s t‐test was used for
  statistical analysis (***P < 0.001).
