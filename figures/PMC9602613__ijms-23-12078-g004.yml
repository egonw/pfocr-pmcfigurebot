caption: 'Quercitrin potentiates the canonical Wnt synaptogenic effect and rescues
  AβO-induced memory impairment in mice. (a–d) Synaptophysin and PSD-95 immunocytochemistry
  of E16 13DIV cultured hippocampal neurons treated with XAV939 and/or quercitrin
  for 24 h. Scale bars: 20 μm. (e) Synaptophysin/PSD-95 colocalized puncta quantification
  of (a–d), showing that quercitrin potentiates the recombinant Wnt-mediated synaptogenesis
  in vitro, which is impaired by XAV939 (n = 3, performed in duplicate, one-way ANOVA
  statistical analysis followed by Newman–Keuls multiple comparisons test. ** p <
  0.01, comparing hWnt3a + DMSO, and hWnt3a + quercitrin conditions. ††p < 0.01, comparing
  hWnt3a + quercitrin and hWnt3a + quercitrin + XAV939 conditions). Scale bars denote
  20 μm. (f) Immunoblotting analysis of injected mice hippocampus lysate staining
  for β-catenin, synaptophysin, and PSD-95. β-actin was used as a cytoskeleton loading
  control. GAPDH was used as a metabolic loading control. Each lane represents a different
  animal. The animals were injected with vehicle (lanes 1–4), vehicle + AβO (lanes
  5–8), or quercitrin + AβO (lanes 9–12). (g–l) Densitometric quantification of (f)
  showing that quercitrin rescues the decreased β-catenin, synaptophysin, and PSD-95
  protein levels caused by AβO ICV injection (n = 4, Unpaired t-test, two-tailed,
  considering the AβO + vehicle as the control condition, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001). Error bars denote mean ± SEM. Each white circle denotes one animal.
  (m) Workflow scheme of the i.c.v. injections, object recognition training, and testing.
  Red square represents a familiar object, and blue object represents a novel object.
  (n) Novel object recognition (NOR) test, 24 h after i.c.v. injection. Quercitrin
  reverses the memory impairment caused by AβO injection, which is impaired by XAV939
  (n = 10, One sample t-test, theoretical mean value of 50%, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01).
  F: familiar object, N: novel object. Error bar represents mean ± SEM. See also  for
  NOR training and open field arena test data.'
