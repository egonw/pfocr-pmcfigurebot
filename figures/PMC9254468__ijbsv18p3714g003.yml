caption: ISP-I significantly enhanced the intracellular ROS levels in NSCLC cells.
  (A) The cluster heat map of DEGs expression patterns of H460 and A549 after treatment
  with ISP-I vs. control as detected by RNA-Seq (up-regulated, red; down-regulated,
  blue). (B) Volcano plots showed DEG number of H460 and A549 after ISP-I treatment
  vs. control (up-regulated, red; down-regulated, blue; unchanged, black). (C) List
  of enriched GO_BP terms. (D) GSEA enrichment plots after ISP-I treated, NES and
  P were shown in each plot. (E) The relative fluorescence intensity for ROS generation
  by flow cytometry in H460 and A549 after ISP-I (10μM, 48h) with or without NAC (2 mM)
  treatment for 48h. (F) Confocal microscopy images of intracellular ROS generation
  in H460 and A549. Treatment protocols were the same as described in Fig. E. The
  mean fluorescence intensity for ROS generation was analyzed by Image J. Scale bars=20μm.
  ns p > 0.05, * p < 0.05 and *** p < 0.001.
