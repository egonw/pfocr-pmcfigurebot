figure_title: Evidence supporting the role of purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNPase)
  in the biosynthetic pathway for production of 8-aminoguanine from 8-nitroguanosine
caption: Red indicates role of PNPase is an open question; EVIDENCE represents findings
  that address the role of PNPase; green indicates role of PNPase is confirmed. Also
  shown are sources of 8-nitroguanosine and the possible contribution of guanine to
  8-nitroguanine formation. Not shown are possible contributions of 8-nitro-2’-deoxyguanosine
  from DNA (or directly from 2’-deoxyguanosine) to the formation of 8-aminoguanine.
  8-NO2-GS, 8-nitroguanosine; 8-NO2-GN, 8-nitroguanine; 8-NH2-GS, 8-aminoguanosine;
  8-NH2-GN, 8-aminoguanine.
