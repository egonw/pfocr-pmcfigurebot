caption: 'Effect of 124mut on TRAF6 ubiquitination, pNF‐κB, and VEGF‐C expression.
  (A) Schematic diagram of ubiquitin. (K: lysine; R: arginine). (B, C) To detect the
  effect of the 124th ubiquitination site mutation on TRAF6 ubiquitination, TRAF6
  or TRAF6 124mut construct were transfected into colorectal cancer (CRC) cells with
  various ubiquitin plasmids, respectively. Ubiquitinated TRAF6 was detected with
  the anti‐HA antibody from immunoprecipitated TRAF6 protein. (D, E) Western blot
  analysis of pNF‐κB and VEGF‐C protein levels in SW480 cells after transfection with
  pCDH‐3×Flag‐TRAF6 or pCDH‐3×Flag‐TRAF6 124mut plasmids. GAPDH served as a loading
  control. The relative protein expression levels of TRAF6, pNF‐κB, and VEGF‐C in
  SW480 and HCT116 cells were quantified. Data are shown as mean ± SD. *P < 0.05;
  **P < 0.01'
