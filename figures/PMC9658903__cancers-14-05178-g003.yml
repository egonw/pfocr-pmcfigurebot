caption: Injecting intratumourally with mixed bacteria from EOC significantly promoted
  tumour growth and reduced tumour model survival compared to mixed bacteria from
  EBOT. (A) Scheme of animal experiments. (B) Images of tumours in different treatment
  groups for 70 days. (C) Changes in tumour volume over time in different treatment
  groups. (D) Final tumour weights in different treatment groups. (E) Kaplan–Meier
  survival curves of mouse EOC models in different treatment groups. Data are presented
  as means ± SD. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA, both with Tukey’s test for multiple
  comparisons, (B–D), respectively, and log-rank test were performed for survival
  data (E); * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.
