caption: A summary of regulation of lncRNAs in GC through different signaling pathways,
  including the PI3K/AKT, STAT3, mTOR, MAPK and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways.
  (1) LncRNA AK023391  and lncRNA ADAMTS9-AS2  participated in GC development by affecting
  PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. (2) LncRNA PVT1 , SNHG16 , and OLC8  participated in
  GC development by affecting STAT3 signaling pathway. (3) LncRNA LINC01419 , HAGLROS
  , NORAD  participated in GC development by affecting mTOR signaling pathway. (4)
  LncRNA AOC4P , CARlo-5 , KCNK15-AS1  participated in GC development by affecting
  MAPK signaling pathway. (5) Some lncRNAs enhanced GC progression by activating other
  signaling pathways, including Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways .
