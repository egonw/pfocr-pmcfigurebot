caption: Ursolic acid reduces the degree of renal interstitial fibrosis after unilateral
  ureteral obstruction in rats. (a) The comparison of the degree of renal interstitial
  fibrosis in the kidney tissues of different groups of rats on the 8th day after
  Masson staining, and the expression of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) in
  the kidney tissues of different groups of rats after immunohistochemical staining
  condition; (b) a statistical graph representing the percentage of positive areas
  of renal interstitial fibrosis in rats in different groups; (c) a statistical graph
  of TGF-β1 immunohistochemical absorbance (A) in the kidney tissues of rats in different
  groups; ∗means P < 0.05; ∗∗means P < 0.01; ∗∗∗ means P < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗means P < 0.0001.
