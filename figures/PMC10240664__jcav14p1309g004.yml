caption: 'CHAC2 promotes lung adenocarcinoma progression. (A) Flow cytometry was conducted
  to detect the cell cycle of PC9 cells overexpressing CHAC2. (B) Flow cytometry was
  conducted to detect the cell cycle of H1299 cells with CHAC2 knockout. (C) Flow
  cytometry was conducted to detect the apoptosis of PC9 cells overexpressing CHAC2.
  (D) Flow cytometry was conducted to detect the apoptosis of H1299 cells with CHAC2
  knockout. (E) Immunohistochemical results of CHAC2, Ki67 and Caspase-3 in subcutaneous
  tumor tissues of PC9 cells overexpressing CHAC2 in nude mice. Scale bar: 50μm. (F)
