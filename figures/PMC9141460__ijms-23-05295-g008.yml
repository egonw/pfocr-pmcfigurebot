caption: Immunohistochemical analysis for MyD88 and phospho-NFκB in the lung tissue
  at 48 h after LPS-induced ALI (×200). (A) Compared to the control group, the percentage
  of MyD88-positive inflammatory cells in the lung tissue as well as the intensity
  of staining for MyD88 within the inflammatory cells was decreased in the MSC group.
  (B) Consistently, the expression of phospho-NFκB was lower in the MSC group.
