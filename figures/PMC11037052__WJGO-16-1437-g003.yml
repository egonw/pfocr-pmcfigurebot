caption: 'Effects of curcumin on apoptosis and proliferation and AKT-mTOR pathway
  proteins. A: After treating BGC-823 and MGC-803 cells with 40 μmol/L curcumin, the
  proteins involved in apoptosis and proliferation and the AKT-mTOR pathway were detected
  using western blotting. Curcumin (40 μmol/L) increased the expression of Bax-2 but
  decreased the expression of Bcl-2, CDK4, and CDK6 and decreased the phosphorylation
  of Akt, mTOR, and P65 in gastric cancer cells; B: Statistical graph of the western
  blotting results. The results were obtained from three independent tests. aP < 0.05,
  bP < 0.01, cP < 0.001.'
