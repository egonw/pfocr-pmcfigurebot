caption: 'Endogenous CaSR promotes Rac activation and cell migration in MDA-MB-231
  cells. (A) Effect of CaSR stimulation on Rac-1 activation. MDA-MB-231 cells were
  stimulated for 10 min with R568 + calcium and total cell lysates were used to isolate
  Rac-1-GTP with GST-PAK-CRIB beads. The fraction of active Rac was revealed by western
  blot. Bars represent mean ± standard deviation (SD); * p = 0.0320; (one-way ANOVA
  followed by Sidak’s test; n = 3). (B) NPS-2143 prevents CaSR-dependent Rac-1 activation.
  Rac-1-GTP was detected by pull-down assays using lysates from MDA-MB-231 cells pre-incubated
  or not with 5 or 10 µM NPS-2143 before stimulation of CaSR. Bars represent mean ± SD,
  **p = 0.0022, ##p = 0.0032; (one-way ANOVA followed by Fisher test; n = 3). (C)
  CaSR knockdown prevents Rac-1 and AKT activation by R568 + calcium. Representative
  western blots showing CaSR knockdown and its effect on the activation of Rac-1 and
  AKT. (D) NPS-2143 prevents CaSR-dependent MDA-MB-231 cell migration. Cells were
  incubated in Boyden chambers to address the effect of extracellular calcium + R568
  or NPS-2143 on CaSR-dependent cell migration. Bars represent mean ± standard deviation
  (SD), **p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001; (one-way ANOVA followed by Sidak''s test; n = 3).
  (E) Effect of pertussis toxin (PTX) and wortmannin (Wm) on CaSR-dependent migration
  of MDA-MB-231 cells. Graph represents mean ± standard deviation (SD), *p = 0.0351,
  #p = 0.0445; (Student t test; n = 3). (F) Effect of chronic treatment with rapamycin
  (40 ng/ml) on CaSR-dependent MDA-MB-231 cell migration. Graph represents mean values,
  normalized to cell migration induced by fetal bovine serum (FBS); error bars represent
  SD, ***p = 0.001; (one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s; n = 3)'
