caption: Mechanisms underlying our results. Leonurine ameliorates ROS damage to BMSCs
  by blocking ROS generation cycle by mitophagy to keep mitochondrial quality control.
  The mechanism probably involves the moderate activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway.
  Therefore, leonurine can activate mitophagy to alleviate damage to BMSCs form ROS
  overload by the moderate PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway.
