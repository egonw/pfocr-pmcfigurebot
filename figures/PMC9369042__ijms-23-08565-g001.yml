caption: 'Expression of miR-7a in the mouse ovary.(A) The expression of miR-7a in
  the ovaries of mice at 6–8 weeks of age was detected by the ISH method. (B) miR-7a
  was adjusted from purple/ blue to red fluorescence. (C)Triple -immunofluorescence
  of adult mice ovary sections: miR-7a (red), FSHR (green), DDX4 (pink), and DAPI
  (blue); yellow is the merge of red and green. (D) The negative control of (A). Bars:
  50 μm.'
