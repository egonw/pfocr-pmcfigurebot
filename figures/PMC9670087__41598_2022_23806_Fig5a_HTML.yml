caption: 'Association between biochemical markers of complement and anti-SARS-CoV2
  antibody response, macrophage activation, acute phase reaction and clinical severity
  of MIS-C. (a): Violin plots (with horizontal lines indicating the median values)
  show results for the MIS-C cases that had samples from acute stage, before IVIG
  treatment, or from stable remission after hospital discharge. Grey lines show changes
  of marker levels for individual MIS-C cases from before treatment (''acute'') after
  hospital discharge in remission (''remission"). P values for the line charts were
  obtained by the Wilcoxon matched-pairs ranked sum test. Non-significant differences
  are not marked, and p value symbols (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001) indicate
  significant results after 5% false discovery rate correction using the Benjamini–Hochberg
  method. (b): Violin plots showing classical- (C1s-C1-inhibitor complex), alternative-
  (Bb fragment) and terminal pathway (sC5b-9 complex) activation marker levels in
  groups with low (below median) or high (above median) anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike and
  nucleocapsid IgG levels (Generic assay IgG binding index), macrophage activation
  (ferritin levels) or acute phase reaction (CRP concentration). * indicates p = 0.002,
  considered significant after 5% false discovery rate correction using the Benjamini–Hochberg
  method.'
