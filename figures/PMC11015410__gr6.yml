caption: Downregulation or overexpression of GNB4 could restore the abilities of proliferation,
  migration, invasion of BC cells, and p-Erk1/2 expression by upregulating or silencing
  circRREB1. A-B. Wound healing assay was performed to determine the migration ability
  of BC cells after transfected with circRREB1 plasmid or si-circ#1 or co-transfected
  with indicated vectors with sh-GNB4 or OE-GNB4 (magnification, × 50, Scale bar,
  1 mm). C-D. EdU assay was utilized to analyze the effect of GNB4 and circRREB1 interactions
  on the proliferation capacity of BC cells. (magnification, × 100, Scale bar, 0.5 mm).
  E-G. Transwell migration and transwell invasion assays (magnification, × 100, Scale
  bar, 0.5 mm) or CCK8 assays were executed to detect the effect of GNB4 and circRREB1
  interactions on the migration and invasion ability of BC cells or cell viability.
  H–I. The effect of interaction between GNB4 and circRREB1 on the expression of key
  factors of the Erk1/2 signaling pathway was detected by Western blot. The data are
  presented as the mean ± SD, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
