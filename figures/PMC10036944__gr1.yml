caption: The mRNA expression and pathway analysis of CENP family genes in pan-cancer.
  (A-H) The expression level of CENPs in tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues
  of 33 TCGA cancer. The purple and green plots represent the tumor and normal sample,
  respectively. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. (I) The expression level of CENP
  family genes in cancer obtained from the GCSA. Pan-cancer analysis of differential
  gene expression at different tumor stages (J) and subtypes (K). The bubble size
  represent the FDR significance. Black outline border indicates FDR < 0.05. (L-M)
  The cancer signaling pathways activated or inhibited by CENP family genes. L presents
  the combined percentage of CENP family genes that have an effect (FDR < 0.05) on
  the pathway in pan-cancer, and the numbers in each cell indicate the percentage.
  The box color from purple to red represents the pathway activity from inhibited
  to activated. In M, solid lines indicate activation, dashed lines indicate inhibition,
  and the colors of the lines represent different cancer types.
