caption: Differentiation of B cells in response to a T cell–dependent antigen. Responding
  naïve B cells enter the T cell zone of the lymph node (upper left), where their
  differentiation is facilitated by cytokines and the encounter of the antigen on
  follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). The antigen activates the B cell receptor, is
  taken up, and presented to Tfh cells through the B cell MHC-II. This initial, extrafollicular
  pathway gives rise to short-lived plasmablasts that enter the periphery, and germinal
  center (GC)–independent memory B cells. In a second phase, activated B cells enter
  the GC dark zone, where they somatically mutate and clonally expand (therefore termed
  centroblasts). B cell cycle between the dark and the light zones (where they are
  termed centrocytes). The dynamic cycle of the GC allows centrocytes that entered
  the light zone to be chosen based on the affinity of their BCRs to the antigen.
  Low-affinity B cells that are not presenting antigen on their BCRs will eventually
  become apoptotic and die. B cells that do present the antigen receive help from
  Tfh through CD40L and IL21 survival signals. The end-products of the GC reaction
  are memory B cells, and long-lived plasma cells. GC memory B cells will enter the
  periphery and re-enter the GC upon BCR stimulation. LLPCs exit the GC and find a
  survival niche, typically the bone marrow (Figure created with BioRender.com)
