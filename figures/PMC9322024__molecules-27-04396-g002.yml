caption: Regulation of autophagy by phytochemicals. Activation of AMPK signaling pathway
  promotes autophagy through the activation of multiple signaling molecules and transcription
  factors, including but not limited to SIRT1 and PGC1-a and the inhibition of mTOR
  []. mTOR further phosphorylates and inactivates TFEB, an important regulator of
  autophagy. Inhibitors of mTOR and its upstream pathway, Akt signaling, can promote
  autophagy []. Similarly, inhibitors of NF-ÎºB have the potential to enhance the completion
  of autophagy process []. Nrf2, when bound to Keap1, a major regulator of Nrf2, is
  quickly degraded but under oxidative stress, it gets released from Keap1 to regulate
  autophagic process by getting translocated into the nucleus to activate the transcription
  of target genes []. Phytochemicals reviewed in this manuscript activate or inhibit
  multiple pathways to modulate autophagy.
