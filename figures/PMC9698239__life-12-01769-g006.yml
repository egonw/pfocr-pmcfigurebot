caption: AIF induced apoptosis in PCa cells via the caspase-dependent pathway. (A)
  LNCaP and C4-2 PCa cells were treated with the different concentrations of AIF or
  vehicle control for 48 h. Subsequently, the apoptotic cells (%) were analyzed with
  three different studies. (B) The representative flow cytometry plots of PCa cells
  treated with control (1.2% DMSO) or AIF (160 Î¼M) were shown. (C) PCa cells were
  exposed to the various contrations of AIF or control. The activity of caspase-3/7
  enzymes were then assayed. The casp-3/7 activity (fold) was assigned as 1.0 in control-treated
  cells. (**) p < 0.01, (***) p < 0.001. (D) The protein expression levels of pro-apoptotic
  BAX, caspase-3, and PARP were affectd by AIF in PCa cells determined by Western
  blot analysis.
