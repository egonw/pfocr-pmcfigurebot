caption: The Nrf2 KO cell line was resistant to the ferroptosis inducer RSL3. (a)
  LDH release levels in control and Nrf2 KO cells treated with different concentrations
  of RSL3 for 24 h. (b) Image showing control and Nrf2 KO cells after 1 μM RSL3 treatment
  for 24 h in a light field. (c) LDH release levels in B. (d) Western blots of Nrf2,
  CTR1, TfR1, p53, and GPX4 protein expression in control and Nrf2 KO cells treated
  with 1 μM RSL3 at different time points. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001.
  Scale bar, 100 μm.
