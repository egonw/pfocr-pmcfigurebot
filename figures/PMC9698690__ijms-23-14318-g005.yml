caption: Co-expression network analysis of StSRO family. (A) Co-expression network
  analysis of StSROs under stress of five heavy metals. The ability of gene expression
  levels is shown in red (strong) and white (weak), respectively. (B) Expression patterns
  of StSROs in different tissues, changes in gene expression levels are shown in red
  (high) and white (low). Root, stem, and leaf are abbreviated to R, S, and T, respectively,
  and time (h) is denoted by 6, 12, and 24, respectively, as detailed in .
