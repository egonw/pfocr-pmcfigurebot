caption: 'Plasma exosomes characterization and relationship between exosomal HMGB1
  and clinical response to radiation. A Transmission electron micrograph of HP-Exos
  and ESCC-Exos. B The size distribution and the concentration of the exosomes were
  measured with Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis. C Western blotting of exosomes and
  cell lysate proteins was performed to confirm exosome marker proteins (CD9, CD81,
  TSG101) and calnexin. D The expression level of HMGB1 in plasma exosomes of ESCC
  was higher than that of HP. E The expression level of exosomal HMGB1 in plasma correlates
  with ESCC radiotherapy’s efficacy. F Response to radiotherapy with different expression
  levels of exosomal HMGB1. Patients with high exosomal HMGB1 expression showed lower
  response rate to radiation (P = 0.005). G The diagnostic power of plasma exosomal
  HMGB1 levels for the clinical response to radiation in patients with ESCC. The AUROC
  of plasma exosomal HMGB1 for clinical response to radiation was 0.80 (95% CI 0.6105–0.9895,
  P = 0.0201). *P < 0.05; HMGB1: high mobility group box 1; ESCC: esophageal squamous
  cell carcinoma; HP: healthy people; Exos: exosomes'
