caption: 'Betaine attenuates the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the NF-κB
  pathway in AβO-treated BV2 cells. Cytoplasmic (A) and nuclear NF-κB (p65) (B) levels
  were analyzed by western blotting. The data were collected from independent experiments
  (n = 3). **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 versus the control group. # # #p < 0.001 versus
  the AβO group. &p < 0.05, &&p < 0.01 versus the AβO+betaine group.'
