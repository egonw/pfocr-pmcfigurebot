figure_title: Molecular mechanisms of preconditioning, postconditioning and RIPC for
  cardioprotection
caption: 'During ischaemic preconditioning, short episodes of myocardial ischaemia
  provide cardioprotection during a subsequent prolonged ischaemic event, whereas
  ischaemic postconditioning is achieved by repetitive brief interruptions of coronary
  blood flow before final complete reperfusion. Remote ischaemic postconditioning
  (RIPC) can be achieved by repetitive cycles of ischaemia and reperfusion to a limb
  via inflation and subsequent deflation of a non-invasive blood-pressure cuff. All
  three experimental approaches target oxygen-sensing pathways and converge on the
  stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), with the concomitant induction
  of crucial HIF target genes. For example, the extracellular signalling molecule
  adenosine and its subsequent activation of the adenosine A2B receptor are central
  to ischaemic preconditioning-mediated cardioprotection. Activation of the adenosine
  A2B receptor also stabilizes circadian protein homologue 2 (PER2), which results
  in amplified PER2 signalling and improved glycolytic capacity of the cardiomyocytes
  and ischaemic tolerance. This increase in ischaemic tolerance leads to myocardial
  protection via attenuated inflammation and oxidative stress, reduced myocardial
  infarct size, and improved mitochondrial function. RIPC can protect organs against
  ischaemia–reperfusion injury via three different pathways: the humoral, the neuronal
  and the systemic pathways. RIPC stabilizes HIF1α in the peripheral musculature,
  leading to the elevated expression of the HIF target gene IL10. The release of IL-10
  from the remote tissue exposed to hypoxia-induced ischaemia subsequently activates
  the IL-10 receptor on cardiomyocytes and protects the heart against ischaemic injury.
  Other mediators involved in this humoral pathway include adenosine, erythropoietin
  and various microRNAs. Second, RIPC activates the production of autacoids, such
  as adenosine and bradykinin, in the remote preconditioned organ, which stimulates
  afferent nerves and relays the neural signal to the myocardium via the efferent
  nerve fibres. Denervation of the neural pathway in the remote organ abolishes RIPC
  protection,. Third, RIPC provokes a systemic response by suppressing genes involved
  in regulating leukocyte chemotaxis and cytokine production, adhesion, and migration
  and upregulating anti-inflammatory genes. Pharmacological HIF activators or prolyl
  hydroxylase inhibitors have been shown to have similar preconditioning and cardioprotective
  effects to those of ischaemic preconditioning.'
