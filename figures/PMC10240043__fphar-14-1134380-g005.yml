caption: 'PUE promotes the viability of hippocampal neurons induced by oxygen-glucose
  deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R). (A) Hippocampal neurons were treated with PUE at
  various concentrations (50–750 nM) and the cell viability was measured by the CCK-8
  assay. (B) Cell viability was measured by the CCK-8 assay after OGD/R and normal
  conditions. (C) Effect of PUE on the release of LDH from hippocampal neurons damaged
  by OGD/R. (D) The percentage of HT22 cell apoptosis was analyzed by staining cells
  with Hoechst 33258 (blue represents viable cells, × 200). (E,F) Apoptotic cells
  rate were detected by flow cytometry. (a) Control group; (b) OGD/R group; (c) PUE
  (150 nM) + OGD/R; (d) PUE (200 nM)+OGD/R; (e) PUE (250 nM)+OGD/R; (f) edaravone.
  All data are expressed as means ± SD (n = 6). ##p < 0.01 vs. control group, *p <
  0.05 or **p < 0.01 vs. OGD/R group.'
