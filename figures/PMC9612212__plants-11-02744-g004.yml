caption: 'Phenylpropanoid-derived metabolic pathways associated with soybean tolerance
  to M. incognita. According to the proteome and transcriptome analyses, the tolerance
  to root-knot nematode observed in the soybean genotype PI 595099 might be associated
  with a super production of secondary metabolites derived from the phenylpropanoids
  pathway, which directly affect nematodes parasitism. (a) Main branch of the phenylpropanoids
  pathway that converts the aromatic amino acid phenylalanine into p-Coumaric Acid
  and 4-Coumaroil-CoA. Phenylalanine is converted into cinnamic acid by the enzyme
  Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase (PAL) and subsequently into p-Coumaric Acid by the Cinnamate-4-Hydroxilase
  (C4H) and upregulated in the tolerant genotype. The p-Coumaric Acid is finally converted
  into 4-Coumaroil-CoA by the 4-Coumarate-CoA-Ligase, and also upregulated in the
  highly tolerant genotype. p-Coumaric Acid and 4-Coumaroil-CoA are the molecular
  backbones for the aromatic-derivative metabolic routes. (b) Pterocarpans-derived
  pathway, converging to glyceollin biosynthesis. The initial and final steps, comprising
  the reaction catalyzed by Chalcone Synthase (CHS) and Isoflavone Reductase (IFR),
  are hyperactive in the tolerant genotype. (c) Flavanone biosynthesis pathway, converging
  to naringenin production. The initial step of this derivative route is shared between
  flavanones and pterocarpans through the reaction catalyzed by the CHS. (d) Anthocyanins-derived
  route. Flavonoid-3′-Hydroxylase and Leucoanthocyanidin Dioxygenase (F3′H and LDOX),
  the main enzymes involved in the synthesis of the active anthocyanins pelargonidin
  and cyanidin, are upregulated in the tolerant genotype. (e) Lignin biosynthesis
  relies on the polymerization of aromatic alcohols derived from phenylalanine and
  tyrosine. A step of this pathway, which converts p-Coumaryl Alcohol into Coniferyl
  Alcohol and Sinapyl Alcohol (catalyzed by the enzyme Caffeoyl-CoA-3-o-Methyltransferase—CCoAMT)
  is upregulated in PI 595099 genotype. The final steps of lignin polymerization,
  catalyzed by cyclic reaction of Laccases (LCC) and Peroxidases (POX), are also upregulated
  in PI 595099. Light blue squares: no changes detected in expression levels. Dark
  blue squares: upregulated enzymes. 4CL—4-Coumarate-CoA-Ligase; C3′H—p-Coumaroyl-5-O-Shikimate
  3′-Hydroxylase; C4H—Cinnamate-4-Hydroxilase; CAD—Cinnamyl Alcohol Dehydrogenase;
  CCoAMT—Caffeoyl-CoA-o-Methyltransferase; CCR—Cinnamoyl-CoA Reductase; CHI—Chalcone
  Isomerase; CHS—Chalcone Synthase; DFR—Dihydroflavonol 4-Reductase; F3′H—Flavonoid
  3′-Hydroxylase; HCT—Hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA: Shikimate Hydroxycinnamoyl Transferase;
