caption: RNA virus and retrovirus interactions with MTs. Examples of how RNA viruses
  and retroviruses interact with, and manipulate, the MT network. Reovirus uses dynein
  motors to move towards perinuclear sites to initiate replication. Human immunodeficiency
  virus type 1 (HIV-1) capsid protein is a cellular MAP mimic that interacts with
  the cellular MAP CLIP170 to promote its transport to the nucleus via MTs. Hepatitis
  C virus (HCV) core protein is a MAP that facilitates lipid droplet transport used
  in virion assembly. Alphacoronavirus spike (S) protein–MT interaction is critical
  for S protein incorporation onto newly forming virions. Rabies virus evades immune
  responses by tethering STAT1 to MTs, blocking its association with STAT2 and its
  nuclear import to activate IFN pathway gene expression. ISRE, interferon-sensitive
  response element. Figure was created using Biorender.com (accessed on 3 May 2022).
