caption: Chromosomal localization of FAM107A in PCa, expression characteristics of
  FAM107A gene, and its correlation with clinical prognosis. (A) FAM107A is located
  in the short-arm region of chromosome 3. (B) Tissue expression of human FAM107A
  gene. Distribution of RNA expression of FAM107A gene in normal tissue types. It
  was created using the transcriptomic dataset of the Human Protein Atlas database.
  (C) FAM107A protein expression in prostate tissue according to human immunochemistry
  data on 44 tissues from the Human Protein Atlas project. (D) Prediction of the possible
  3D structure of the FAM107A protein according to AlphaFold Monomer v2.0. (E) FAM107A
  was expressed at lower levels in prostate tumor specimens than normal prostate tissue
  specimens. GEPIA includes 492 prostate cancer tissue samples and 52 normal prostate
  tissue samples from the TCGA database, and 100 normal prostate tissue samples from
  the GTEx database. Overall survival (OS) of patients with prostate cancer according
  to FAM107A expression (http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn (accessed on 1 June 2022)). (F)
  FAM107A expression levels were lower in prostate cancer tumor tissues compared to
  normal prostate tissues in the GSE70768 dataset. (G) FAM107A expression levels were
  lower in prostate cancer tumor tissues compared to normal prostate tissues in the
  dataset GSE46602. (H) Kaplanâ€“Meier analysis of overall survival (OS) of prostate
  cancer patients according to FAM107A expression in the GSE16560 dataset. **** for
  p < 0.0001, and * for p < 0.05.
