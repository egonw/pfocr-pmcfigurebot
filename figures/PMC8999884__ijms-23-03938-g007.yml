caption: 'Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) mediates epithelial-mesenchymal transition
  (EMT) through TGF-β signaling pathway in human endometriotic epithelial cells. pSMAD-2,
  SLUG, and SNAIL levels detected by Western blotting. β-actin was used as the internal
  loading control for Western blot analysis data normalization. All data are expressed
  as relative values against their respective control group. Data represent the mean
  ± standard deviation of three independent experiments. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 and
  *** p < 0.001 (vs. control); ## p < 0.01 and ### p < 0.001 (vs. control); ¤¤¤ p
  < 0.001.'
