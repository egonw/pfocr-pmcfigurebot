caption: Aberrant dendritic spine morphology in mutant neurons is regulated by TrkB
  and is rescued by enhancement of PARP1 activity. (A–C) Fluorescence microscopic
  images of dendritic spines. (A) From the indicated genotypes. Pharmacological treatments
  and transfections were performed as indicated; scale bar, 2 µm. Quantification of
  the average length of the spine (B) and the spine density (C) along a 720 µm-long
  dendrite. Mus., mushroom; Stu., stubby. D, DHIQ; D/N, both DHIQ and NAD. Data are
  presented as mean ± SEM (n = 18 neurons, three independent experiments, total 540
  spines). ns, P > 0.05, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001 (two-way ANOVA).
