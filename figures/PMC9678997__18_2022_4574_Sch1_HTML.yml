caption: Illustration of the role of LRRK2–PINK1 on TH expression and DA synthesis
  in DA neurons. Under physiological conditions, LRRK2 and PINK1 form a functional
  balance to maintain normal TH expression and DA synthesis in DA neurons. LRRK2 promotes
  TH expression and DA generation, while PINK1 suppresses TH expression and DA generation.
  LRRK2 and PINK1 can regulate degradation of each other, and thus a balance can be
  reached. When LRRK2 is mutated, its kinase activity is increased, leading to up-regulated
  TH expression and increased DA generation. Increased LRRK2 kinase activity can facilitate
  PINK1 degradation, down-regulate PINK1 level and suppress PINK1 function. This will
  lead to imbalance between LRRK2 and PINK1, contributing to increased TH expression,
  enhanced DA generation, aggravated DA oxidation and elevated DA-relevant stress
  in DA neurons, promoting neurodegeneration. When PINK1 is mutated, kinase activity
  will be impaired causing LRRK2–PINK1 imbalance and disrupting the TH–DA pathway,
  promoting DA neuron vulnerability and neurodegeneration
