caption: Metabolite alteration in cNLBP patients. A Pathway enrichment analysis revealed
  different metabolic pathways enriched in cNLBP patients (P value cutoff ≤ 0.05). B The
  results from the pathway analysis carried out with the web-based tool METPA using
  the concentrations of metabolites identified in cNLBP patients. Total cmpd, the
  total number of compounds in the pathway. Hits are the matched number from the uploaded
  data. Raw P is the original P value. Impact is the pathway impact value calculated
  from pathway topology analysis
