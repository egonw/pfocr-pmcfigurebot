caption: 'Effects of Dyglomera® on lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. 3T3-L1
  preadipocytes were differentiated to mature adipocytes with differentiation media
  supplemented with or without Dyglomera® extract. Lipid accumulation was quantified
  by Oil-red O staining and absorbance at 520 nm. Control group (“0 μg/mL”), only
  dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) treated no differentiation control; MDI, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine,
  dexamethasone, and insulin treated differentiation group. Scale bar = 500 μm. ##
  p < 0.01 vs. control group. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 vs. MDI control group. Data
  are presented as mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments.'
