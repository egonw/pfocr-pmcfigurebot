figure_title: Main hallmarks of poststroke systemic inflammation over time
caption: The peripheral immune response to stroke is initiated within minutes after
  stroke onset. DAMP are originated from dying or stressed cells within the ischemic
  brain or actively secreted by immune cells upon activation. Circulating DAMPs activate
  peripheral immune cells and provoke a massive expression and release of pro‐inflammatory
  cytokines into the bloodstream. Within the acute phase, stroke also induces the
  mobilization of more leukocytes from the spleen and the bone marrow as well as the
  activation of neurogenic pathways. In the subacute phase, within hours to days after
  stroke onset, a state of immunosuppression is triggered. The prolonged overactivation
  of neurogenic pathways as well as DAMP and other pro‐inflammatory mediators acutely
  released after stroke gradually induce lymphopenia due to massive cell death and
  the pronounced bias towards the monocyte differentiation pathway in bone marrow
  hematopoiesis. The is also a disbalance between Type 1 (Th1) and Type 2 (Th2) helper
  T cells and circulating monocytes are less capable of providing costimulatory signals.
  Later in time, a long‐term phase compromising peripheral immunity is characterized
  by chronic and sustained high levels of DAMP and pro‐inflammatory cytokines.
