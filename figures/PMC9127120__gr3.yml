caption: 'Identification of genes involved in the IFN signaling pathway that upregulates
  CD47 expression(A) qRT-PCR analysis of various genes involved in the IFN signaling
  pathway in A549 cells upon incubation with recombinant IFN-γ (100 ng/mL, 24 h).
  (B) Normalized luciferase reporter expression of A549 cells transduced with different
  sets of lentiviral shRNA constructs. Upper: Schematic representation of the CD47-Prom-Firefly
  Luciferase-EF1AProm-Renilla luciferase constructs used to generate the reporter
  cell lines. Lower: Quantitative analysis. (C) IRF1 protein levels in human lung
  cancer cells upon incubation with recombinant IFN-γ (100 ng/mL, 24 h). Upper: Representative
  image; lower: quantitative analysis. Data from more than 3 independent experiments
  were presented as means ± SDs. ∗∗∗p < 0.001.'
