caption: PGP effects of JR48 on plants. (A-C) Seedling growth under JR48 treatment.
  Seedlings of Arabidopsis (A), Chinese cabbage (B), and tomato (C) were treated with
  sterile water (control) or indicated bacterial suspensions of JR48 at different
  concentrations. Fresh weight were measured and calculated at 7 days post treatment.
  Values are means ± SD (n = 30; *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01 compared with control, Dunnett’s
  test). Experiments were repeated in triplicate. (D-F) Plant growth under JR48 treatment.
  Arabidopsis (D), Chinese cabbage (E), and tomato (F) plants were treated as described
  above. Representative photographs (left panel) were taken at 14 days post treatment
  and fresh weight were measured at the same time. Values are means ± SD representative
  of three independent biological replicates (n = 20; *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01 compared
  with control, Dunnett’s test).
