caption: 'PSP alleviated LPS-induced oxidative damage by regulating the Nrf2 signaling
  pathway. (a, b) show representative blots of Nrf2, HO-1, and quantification data
  for Nrf2/β-actin and HO-1/β-actin after LPS treatment. (c, d) show representative
  blots of Nrf2 and HO-1 and quantification data for Nrf2/β-actin and HO-1/β-actin
  after PSP treatment. (e) shows immunofluorescence images of Nrf2 and DAPI. (f) shows
  quantitative measurements of Nrf2+ cells. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM.
  ∗P < 0.05 vs. control, #P < 0.05 vs. LPS group.'
