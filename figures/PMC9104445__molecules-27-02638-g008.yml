caption: Schematic diagram representing the neuroprotective effects of piperine in
  the hippocampus of rats induced by KA. Piperine pretreatment ameliorates glutamate
  hyperactivity, upregulates NGF expression by increasing MMP7 levels and decreasing
  MMP9 levels, and enhances TrkA and Akt/GSK3Î² activation, which prevents KA-induced
  neuronal loss and maintains memory function. Arrows indicate KA-induced regulation,
  and T-bars indicate piperine-mediated inhibitory effects.
