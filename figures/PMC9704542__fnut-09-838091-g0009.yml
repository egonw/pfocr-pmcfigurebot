caption: 'KEGG pathway was enriched according to the results of differential metabolites
  in liver tissue. The abscissa represents the Rich factor corresponding to each pathway,
  the ordinate represents the pathway name, and the color of the point indicates the
  p-value: the redder the point, the more significant the enrichment. The size of
  the dot represents the number of enriched differential metabolites. Normal, rats
  fed a normal diet ad libitum; MAFLD (metabolic associated fatty liver disease),
  rats fed a high-fat diet ad libitum; TRF (time-restricted feeding), rats fed high-fat
  diet (60 kcal% fat) strictly between 16:00 and 22:00 every day. (A) Normal vs. MAFLD;
  (B) MAFLD vs. TRF.'
