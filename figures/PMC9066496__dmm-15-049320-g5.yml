caption: ARCND2-associated PLCB4 mutants interfere with SRE activity in a dominant-negative
  manner. (A) Schematic of the signaling pathway that stimulates SRE:luc2p transcription.
  Gq p.Gln209Leu activates the Raf-MEK/ERK pathway through PLCB, resulting in activation
  of the serum response element (SRE). (B) Relative luminescence from cells co-transfected
  with SRE:luc2p, Gq p.Gln209Leu and wild-type or mutant PLCB4. Luminescence is expressed
  as the fold change relative to cells expressing wild-type PLCB4. Data points are
  individual experiments [n=3 for all samples except wild type and p.Arg621His (n=4)].
  Error bars represent s.e.m. Significance versus wild type was calculated using Prism
  and an unpaired two-tailed t-test (p.Arg621His, P<0.0001; p.Tyr623Cys, P=0.0008;
  p.Glu358Val, P=0.0002; p.Asp360Val, P<0.0001; p.Pro838Ala;p.Arg621His, P=0.36).
  ***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001; ns, not significant.
