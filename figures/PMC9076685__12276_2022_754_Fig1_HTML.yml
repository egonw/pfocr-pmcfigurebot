caption: In the amyloidogenic pathway, β-secretase cleaves APP extracellularly to
  release sAPPβ and a membrane-bound APP-CTF (C99). C99 is subsequently cleaved by
  γ-secretase to release Aβ and the APP intracellular domain (AICD). In the non-amyloidogenic
  pathway, APP is cleaved by α-secretase to release sAPPα and a membrane-bound APP-CTF
  (C83). C83 is cleaved further by γ-secretase to release p3 and AICD.
