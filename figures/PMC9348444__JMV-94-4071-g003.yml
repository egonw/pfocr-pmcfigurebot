caption: Evolutionary origin and transmission routes of SARS‐CoV‐2. (A) The evolutionary
  origin and journey of SARS‐CoV‐2 through different primary and intermediate hosts.
  Different paths of potential viral transmissions are indicated with yellow arrows.
  (B) The circular phylogenetic tree illustrates the positions of human coronavirus
  HKU1 (HCoV‐HKU1), human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV‐OC43), Middle East respiratory syndrome
  coronavirus (MERS‐CoV), Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)‐associated coronavirus
  (SARS‐CoV and SARS‐CoV‐2) in different host groups. The complete genome sequences
  were collected from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database
  and analyzed in The Interactive Tree Of Life (https://itol.embl.de) online software
  tool. A separate phylogenetic tree of HCoV‐HKU1, HCoV‐OC43, MERS‐CoV, SARS‐CoV,
  and SARS‐CoV‐2 is shown on the right panel.
