caption: Results of metabolomic analyses in cells and plasma of mice treated with
  oridonin. A. Cluster plot of differentially expressed metabolites in 4T1 cells.
  Yellow represents an elevated level of metabolites, and blue represents decreased
  levels of metabolites. (Con-control group, Ori- oridonin group) B. Cluster plot
  of differentially expressed metabolites in mice serum. Yellow represents increased
  metabolites, and blue represents decreased metabolites (Nor-normal group, Mod-model
  group, Ori-oridonin group). C. Enrichment of metabolites in various metabolic pathways
  in 4T1 cells. The darker the color, the smaller the P-value, and the larger the
  circle, the greater the number of differentially expressed metabolites. D. Overview
  of the enriched metabolome in mice serum.
