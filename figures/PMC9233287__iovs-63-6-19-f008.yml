caption: 'The variation of nerve-related genes between the non-SD group and SD group
  in mouse ELGs. (A) Schematic diagram of tear secretion test in mice using phenol
  red threads. (B) Tear secretion of mice in an LD cycle for the non-SD group and
  SD group (non-SD-treated mice: F = 17.660, P < 0.001; SD-treated mice: F = 3.096,
  P = 0.05). ***P < 0.001. (C) Comparison of average tear secretion between the non-SD
  group and SD group in an LD cycle. ***P < 0.001. (D) Heatmaps of diurnal expression
  for nerve-related genes between the non-SD group and SD group in mouse ELGs. The
  expression levels of nerve-related genes were obtained from RNA-Seq and expression
  range of DEGs was normalized to ± 3. (E) The significantly enriched KEGG pathways
  enriched histogram of nerve-related genes with Q < 0.05 were displayed. (F) The
  PPANs and functional clusters (clusters 1–4) with relevant KEGG pathway of nerve-related
  genes between the non-SD group and SD group in mouse ELGs (Q < 0.05). (G-H) The
  enriched nerve-related KEGG pathways and heatmap were created by GSEA in the non-SD
  group and SD group. (I) Typical image of anti-mouse beta III tubulin (red) nerve
  fibers between the non-SD group and SD group in mouse ELGs. Scale bar: 50 µm. (J)
  Average relative abundance of beta III tubulin (red) nerve fibers of ELGs from non-SD
  group and SD group. *P < 0.05.'
