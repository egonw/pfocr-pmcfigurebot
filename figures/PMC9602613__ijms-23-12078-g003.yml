caption: Quercitrin facilitates GSK3 S9 phosphorylation and hinders GSK3 activity.
  (a–c) TOPFLASH reporter gene assay of HEK293T cells transfected with (a) β-catenin
  S33A, (b) β-catenin WT, or (c) LRP6 (n = 3, performed in triplicate, one-way ANOVA
  followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test, ns = not significant). (d) Reporter
  gene assay of HEK293T cells treated with 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 1.0 μM of BIO, a GSK3
  inhibitor. (n = 3, performed in triplicate, Two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s
  multiple comparisons test, * p < 0.05). Error bars denote mean ± SD. (e) GSK3 biosensor
  scheme. The biosensor contains the GFP protein at the N-terminus and a FLAG-tag
  at the C-terminus. The phosphorylation of the biosensor by GSK3 triggers its degradation.
  (f) Immunoblotting assay of HEK293T transfected with the GSK3 biosensor after 6
  h treatment. Cells were treated with L-cell CM (lane 1) or Wnt3a CM (lanes 2–5).
  (g) Densitometric analysis of β-catenin/α-tubulin protein levels (n = 4, Unpaired
  t-test, two-tailed, *** p < 0.001). Error bars denote mean ± SD. (h) Densitometric
  analysis of GSK3 biosensor/α-tubulin protein levels showing that quercitrin treatment
  hinders GSK3 activity (n = 4, Unpaired t-test, two-tailed, *** p < 0.001). Error
  bars denote mean ± SD. (i) Immunoblotting of RKO cells lysate after 24 h treatment.
  RKO cells were treated with L-cell CM (lane 1) or Wnt3a CM (lanes 2–4). (j) Densitometry
  analysis of pGSK3βS9/GSK3β protein levels demonstrating that quercitrin increases
  the pGSK3βS9/GSK3β ratio (n = 4, one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons
  test, * p < 0.05). Error bars denote mean ± SD. (k) Reporter gene assay of RKO B/R
  cells treated with L-cell CM or Wnt3a CM, quercitrin, and 5 μM XAV939 for 24 h.
  The treatment reveals that XAV939 impairs the quercitrin potentiation effect (n
  = 3, performed in triplicate, one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons
  test considering Wnt3a CM + DMSO condition as control, * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001,
  or considering Wnt3a CM + DMSO + XAV939 as the control condition, ‡‡‡p < 0.001.
  An Unpaired t-test of DMSO and DMSO + XAV939 conditions was performed to assess
  the XAV939 effect on the reporter gene activity, ††p < 0.01). Error bars denote
  mean ± SD. (l) Scheme of quercitrin mechanism of action. Quercitrin hinders GSK3
  activity, thus impairing β-catenin degradation and increasing its stabilization.
  The red arrow indicates β-catenin degradation. The black arrow denotes β-catenin
  translocation to the nucleus and Wnt target genes transcription.
