caption: In female Gulo−/− pups, GP was significantly down-regulated after VC deprivation.
  TMT-based comparative proteomics analyses for female pups' livers supplemented or
  depleted of VC for 3 weeks. (A) A volcano plot of DEPs in liver tissues. All proteins
  were plotted on the x-axis with log2 fold change and log10 (the sum of intensity
  in two samples) on the y-axis. The red dots in the upper right (ratio>1.2) and blue
  dots in the upper left (ratio<0.833) sections with p < 0.05 represent proteins that
  were significantly up-or down-regulated between groups. Gray dots represented proteins
  that were identical in the two compared groups. (B) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
  of the top twenty enrichment scores for DEPs. The pathways were depicted on the
  y-axis. The x-axis displayed the number of DEPs in each pathway. (C) Hierarchical
  clustering of DEPs in the glucagon signaling pathway. Each column represented a
  tissue sample, and each line represented a protein that was differentially expressed.
  The expression levels of DEPs were indicated by a color scale ranging from blue
  (low) to red (high). The colors red and blue represent up-and down-regulation, respectively.
  The case represents female pups with VC deficiency, while the control represents
  female pups with VC supplementation. (For interpretation of the references to color
  in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)
