caption: MYH9 increases glioma proliferation and resistance to temozolomide via the
  c-Myc signaling pathway. Gross morphology of tumors (A) and tumor weight statistics
  (B) from the indicated groups (n = 5 per group). (C) Tumor volume statistics for
  each mouse group (n = 5 per group). (D) MYH9 and PCNA was evaluated by immunohistochemical
  staining. Compared with shMYH9 cells, the shNC cell tumor tissues were high expression.
  (E) Western blotting analysis of the protein levels of MYH9, c-Myc, CCND1 and CDK4
  after transfecting siNC or siMYH9 into U87 and LN229 cells. Data are presented as
  the mean ± SD for three independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001
