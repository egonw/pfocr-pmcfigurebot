caption: CLEFMA induced apoptosis in OSCC. (A) Cells were treated with various CLEFMA
  concentrations and then subjected to apoptosis assay through flow cytometry with
  annexin V/PI staining for 24 h. The quantification results of apoptosis assay of
  (B) HSC-3 and (C) SCC-9 cells are shown in the bar graph. Data represent the average
  Â± standard deviation (SD) from three independent experiments. * p < 0.05 compared
  with the DMSO control group.
