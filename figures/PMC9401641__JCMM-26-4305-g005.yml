caption: BMI‐1 was regulated through EGFR/JNK pathway in LAC cells. (A) Different
  LAC cell lines bearing wild‐type or mutant EGFRs (EGFR‐wt or EGFR‐mt) were detected
  for BMI1 expressions by Western blot or IF assay. (B) A549 cells were treated with
  EGF (100 ng/ml, 24 h) and detected for BMI1 expression by Western blot or IF assay.
  (C) BEAS‐2B cells were transduced with mutant EGFR (L858R) vector and detected for
  BMI1 expression by Western blot or IF assay. (D) LAC cells transduced with the SC,
  shJNK1, shJNK2 or shJNK1 + 2 vectors were detected for pJNK, JNK1, JNK2, BMI1 expressions.
  GAPDH or β‐ACTIN serve as loading control for Western blot. For IF, nuclei were
  counter‐stained by DAPI, and BMI1 signals (Dylight 549) were captured by the same
  exposure time in microscope for all the photos. SC, the scramble shRNA; shJNK1,
  the shRNA targeting JNK1; shJNK2, the shRNA targeting JNK2; shJNK1 + 2, the mixture
  of shJNK1 and shJNK2
