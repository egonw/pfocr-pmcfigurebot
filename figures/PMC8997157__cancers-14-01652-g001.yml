caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the PI3K/AKT/PTEN/mTOR signaling pathway in
  a cell. A ligand-engaged RTK binds PI3K either directly or indirectly, removing
  the inhibitory action of its p85 subunit on the catalytic p110 subunit. In physiological
  conditions, growth factors stimulate PI3K, which subsequently phosphorylates the
  phospholipid substrate PIP2 to generate the second messenger PIP3. PIP3 recruits
  and activates several functional targets, such as AKT isoform, PDK1, and others.
  The lipid phosphatase PTEN converts PIP3 to PIP2, which terminates accentuation
  of the growth signal to maintain normal cellular and tissue homeostasis. RTKs, receptor
  tyrosine kinases; IGF, insulin-like growth factors; EGF, epidermal growth factor;
  HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; PTEN, phosphatase
  and tensin homolog; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; PDK1, phosphoinositide-dependent
  kinase-1; AKT, protein kinase B; mTORC1, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1.
