caption: Efe-AfpA (A) and PAF (B) activity against N. crassa wild type and glucosylceramide
  pathway mutants. Increasing concentrations of the proteins were assayed for activity
  in the N. crassa growth assay with 1 × 104 conidia mL−1. The data presented are
  the means and standard deviations of three replicates. For each concentration, columns
  with different letters indicate a significant difference in activity (p ≤ 0.05,
  two-way ANOVA).
