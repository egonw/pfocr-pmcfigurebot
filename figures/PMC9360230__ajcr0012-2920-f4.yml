caption: HER2 is a cancer-causing gene with four membrane tyrosine kinase receptors
  (HER1-HER4), a molecular switch, and more than ten ligands. Ligand binding causes
  a conformational change in HER1, HER3, and HER4 that facilitates homo- or heterodimerization
  with another family member. HER2, which is gene-amplified and/or overexpressed in
  20% of breast cancers, lacks a ligand and lies in an open conformation in the membrane.
  Due to its heterodimerization capability and increased expression, HER2 activates
  itself by homodimerizing with other ligand-bound HER members. In response to dimerization
  of the HER receptors, their TKs are activated. This initiates a phosphorylation
  cascade, which triggers downstream signaling pathways, including Ras/p42/44 MAPK
  and PI3K/AKT. By modifying and phosphorylating transcription factors and other parts
  of the transcription and cell-cycle machinery, downstream kinases stimulate the
  transcriptional and cell-cycle machinery. As a result, tumor cells can be stimulated
  to proliferate, survive, become angiogenic, and metastatic. Because HER3â€™s TK is
  inactive (X), the downstream signaling pathway can only be activated by heterodimerization
  with other HER members. According to the FDA, the HER2-targeted drugs approved for
  treating HER2+ breast cancer are trastuzumab, pertuzumab, trastuzumab DMT-1, and
  lapatinib.
