caption: Serum proteomic characterization of the natural history of chronic HBV infection.(A–C)
  Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses of the identified 1162 proteins from pooled
  serum were done to evaluate enriched cellular components, molecular functions, and
  biological processes among the natural history of chronic HBV infection. (D) Heatmap
  of serum proteomic profiles in different disease phases. (E and F) GO Terms and
  Reactome pathway enrichment analyses of 226 differentially expressed proteins were
  performed to evaluate enriched biological processes and signaling pathways in different
  phases of chronic HBV infection. (G) Serum protein pattern analyses by the Short
  Time-series Expression Miner (STEM). FDR, false discovery rate; IT, immune-tolerant
  phase; IA, immune reactive HBeAg-positive phase; IC, inactive HBV carrier state
  phase; ENH, HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B phase.
