caption: Knocking down KLF2 expression reverses the effect of PTP1B silencing on cell
  viability, inflammation, apoptosis and oxidative stress in ox-LDL-induced HUVECs.
  (A) mRNA and (B) protein expression of KLF2 in HUVECs transfected with or without
  sh-KLF2 were measured using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting.
  (C) Cell viability was measured using Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. (D) LDH levels
  were analyzed using a corresponding kit. (E) The levels of IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α
  were measured using ELISA. (F) Cell apoptosis was measured using TUNEL assay. Scale
  bar, 50 µm. (G) Levels of MDA, SOD and GSH-Px were assessed using corresponding
  kits. Results represent the mean ± SD. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001. KLF2, Kruppel-like
  factor 2; PTP1B, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B; ox-LDL, oxidized low-density lipoprotein;
  Ov, overexpression plasmid; NC, negative control; sh, short hairpin; LDH, lactate
  dehydrogenase; MDA, malondialdehyde; SOD, superoxide dismutase; GSH-Px, glutathione
  peroxidase.

  ox-LDL-induced HUVECs by activating the AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway via negative
  regulation of KLF2.
