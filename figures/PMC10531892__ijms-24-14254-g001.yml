caption: 'Inhibitory impact of TQ on CALR, NLRP3 and PYCARD expression in PBMCs of
  HR+ BC patients. (A–C) CALR expression versus TQ concentrations. PBMCs isolated
  from HR+ BC patients were treated with TQ (0, 20, 50, and 100 µM) for (A) 24 h,
  (B) 48 h, and (C) 72 h. (D–E) NLRP3 expression versus TQ concentrations. PBMCs isolated
  from HR+ BC patients were treated with TQ (0, 20, 50, and 100 µM) for (D) 24 h and
  (E) 48 h. (F–H) PYCARD expression versus TQ concentrations. PBMCs isolated from
  HR+ BC patients were treated with TQ (0, 20, 50, and 100 µM) for (F) 24 h, (G) 48
  h, and (H) 72 h. All experiments were performed in triplicate, and data are expressed
  as the mean ± standard deviation. Statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad
  Prism software version 9.1.1. The data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s
  multiple comparisons to compare each treated column and the DMSO control column
  (**** p value < 0.0001; *** p value < 0.001; ** p value < 0.01; * p < 0.05). TQ:
  thymoquinone; CALR: calreticulin; NLRP3: NOD-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain-containing
  protein 3 (NLRP3); PYCARD: PYD and CARD domain containing; PBMCs: peripheral blood
  mononuclear cells; HR+: hormone receptor-positive; BC: breast cancer; DMSO: dimethyl
  sulfoxide; ns: non-significant.'
