figure_title: Genetic disruption of Mybpc3 enhanced NF-κB signaling pathway in fibroblasts
caption: A, B Western blotting analysis of phosphorylated and total p65 in WT and
  MYBPC3-KO fibroblasts treated with or without SB-431542 (10 µM). C–F ELISA measurements
  of the cytokine levels of CCL2, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in culture supernatant of
  WT and MYBPC3-KO fibroblasts treated with or without PDTC (10 µM). G, H Western
  blotting analysis of phosphorylated and total p65, TGF-β1, and HIF-1α in WT and
  MYBPC3-KO fibroblasts treated with or without PDTC (10 µM). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01;
  ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001; ns, not significant.
