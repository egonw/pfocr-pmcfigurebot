caption: p62 overexpression protects the proteasome stability of a cell by increasing
  the number of ubiquitinated protein aggregates that are sent to the autophagy lysosomal
  pathway. A deficiency in UPS decreases the number of ubiquitinated proteins degraded
  by UPS, leading to increased p62 expression and phosphorylation on S405 and S409.
  Upon UPS inhibition, the levels of Nrf2 increases, inducing p62 overexpression.
  The greater concentration of p62 better enables it to compete with Nrf2 for Kea1,
  forming p62-Keap1 complexes, which assist with the formation of ubiquitinated protein
  aggregates for degradation by autophagy. HDAC6 is critical in the autophagy lysosomal
  pathway, but its synthesis is directly inhibited by UPS inhibition and p62 overexpression.
  However, p62 overexpression can be inhibited by an increase in autophagy. Therefore,
  the ratio of p62 to HDAC6 is essential for cellular stability (reproduced from the
  open source, from Liu et al., 2016, mod.) .
