figure_title: GO analysis of the msil2/4 DEGs reveals molecular functions associated
  to plant defense and response to biotic and abiotic stresses
caption: (A) Boxplots showing the read counts corresponding to the up- and down-regulated
  genes as well as the genes involved in the xylan/cellulose and lignin biosynthesis
  pathways in Col-0 and msil2/4. ns, not significant; ***p<0.001; t test. (B) The
  gene ontology analysis of DEGs was performed using ShinyGO v0.76 software. Lollipop
  diagrams provide information about GO fold enrichment, significance (FDR in log10),
  and number of genes in each pathway. (C) The DEG products are preferentially targeted
  to the extracellular region and the cell wall.
