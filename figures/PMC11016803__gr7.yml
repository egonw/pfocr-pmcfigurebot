caption: 'Effects of supplemental Zn sources and Zn levels on the protein expression
  of MAPK (ERK, JNK and p38MAPK) signaling pathway (Exp.2). (A–C) The total protein
  and phosphorylated protein expression of ERK, JNK and p38MAPK. D Representative
  immunoblots of MAPK signaling pathway. iZn: inorganic Zn sulphate. oZn: organic
  Zn proteinate. NT: normal temperature, 40℃. HT: high temperature, 44℃. fx CON: no
  Zn supplement. fx 50: 50 μmol/L Zn supplemental level. fx 100: 100 μmol/L Zn supplemental
  level. ERK: extracellular regulated protein kinase. JNK: C-jun N-terminal kinase.
  p38MAPK: mitogen activated protein kinase. p-ERK: phosphorylated extracellular regulated
  protein kinase. p-JNK: phosphorylated C-jun N-terminal kinase. p-p38MAPK: phosphorylated
  mitogen activated protein kinase. All cells are treated for 8 h at different temperatures.
  Different letters indicate significant differences among treatments (P < 0.05).
  Data are means ± SE (n = 6).'
