caption: After neutrophil formation of NETs, damage-associated molecular patterns
  (DAMPs) are released by NETs. Histones selectively bind to Toll-like receptors (TLR)
  at different concentrations, leading to the activation of NF-κB and the transcription
  of AP-1. On the one hand, this may cause ECs to release inflammatory cytokines to
  amplify the inflammatory response. On the other hand, it promotes the expression
  of tissue factor (TF) and leads to platelet aggregation. Finally, all of them cause
  damage to the function of ECs. In addition, the binding of histone to EC membrane
  can also cause cell membrane perforation, lead to calcium ion inflow into cells
  and damage ECs. Extracellular histone, extracellular cold-inducible RNA-binding
  protein (eCIRP), as another molecule of DAMPs, activate TLR4/TLR9/NF-κB signal pathway
  through NETs release and binding to EC surface receptors. After ROS and NLRP3 inflammasome
  are released to activate the pathway, NLRP3 can be activated by ROS to cause ER
  stress and secrete pro-inflammatory substances (IL-18, IL-1β, HMGB1). Pro-inflammatory
  substances promote the release of more pro-inflammatory granules (TGF-α, IL-6, IL-1β,
  IL-8) and further aggravate ED by activating NF-κB signal pathway by binding to
  the corresponding surface receptors of peripheral ECs. IL-8 secreted by ECs can
  also act on more neutrophils, increasing the expression of NETs, forming positive
  feedback and aggravating NETosis. In another novel way, NETosis can release externalized
  RNA. Externalized RNA is internalized by the surrounding ECs by binding to TLR9,
  resulting in ED.
