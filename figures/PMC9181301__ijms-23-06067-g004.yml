caption: 'LtfiCre/+Arid1af/f uteri exhibit immune-related gene expression changes
  at GD 3.5. (A) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of the 4181 genes differentially expressed
  between Arid1af/f and LtfiCre/+Arid1af/f uteri (FDR < 0.05) identified 194 significantly
  enriched canonical pathways (p < 0.05). The plot shows the top 15 immune-related
  pathways from this list based on their corresponding p-values and also displays
  ratios (genes in current set/total genes in pathway) and number of genes from each
  pathway dysregulated in LtfiCre/+Arid1af/f uteri. (B) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  of the 4181 genes differentially expressed between Arid1af/f and LtfiCre/+Arid1af/f
  uteri (FDR < 0.05) identified 1526 significantly enriched upstream regulators (p
  < 0.05). The plot shows the top 15 immune-related upstream regulators from this
  list based on their corresponding p-values and also displays activation z-score
  and number of target molecules in the dataset. The plots were created with ggplot2
  in Rstudio. (C) Relative expression levels of the mRNA from each gene were normalized
  to Rpl7 in whole uterine RNA preparations from control (n = 5, empty bar and empty
  dot) and LtfiCre/+Arid1af/f (n = 5, grey bar and filled dot) uteri at GD3.5 determined
  with RT-qPCR. The graphs represent the mean ± SEM. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***,
  p < 0.001; ns, p > 0.05. Abbreviations: Arid1a, AT-rich interaction domain 1A; Ccr2,
