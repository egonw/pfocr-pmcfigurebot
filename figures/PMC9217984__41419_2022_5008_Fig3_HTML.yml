caption: A, B qPCR analysis of PDK1 (A) and PGK1 (B) mRNA in H1299 cells transfected
  with or without Flag-OTUB1 and cultured under normoxia (21% O2) for 24 h, followed
  by treatment with DMSO or DMOG (1 mM) for 8 h. Flag empty vector was used as a control.
  Two-way ANOVA analysis; Data show mean ± SD; Tukey’s multiple comparisons test;
  ns, not significant, *Adjusted p < 0.05, **Adjusted p < 0.01, ***Adjusted p < 0.001,
  ****Adjusted p < 0.0001; Data from 3 independent experiments. C, D qPCR analysis
  of PDK1 (C) and BNIP3 (D) mRNA in H1299 cells transfected with or without Flag-OTUB1
  and cultured under normoxia (21% O2) for 24 h, followed by treatment with DMSO or
  FG4592 (100 μM) for 8 h. Flag empty vector was used as a control. Two-way ANOVA
  analysis; Data show mean ± SD; Tukey’s multiple comparisons test; ns, not significant,
  *Adjusted p < 0.05, **Adjusted p < 0.01, ***Adjusted p < 0.001, ****Adjusted p < 0.0001;
  Data from 3 independent experiments. E Western blot analysis of indicated proteins
  in VHL-deficient or wildtype H1299 cells (VHL−/− or VHL+/+) cultured under normoxia
  (21% O2). F qPCR analysis of PDK1 and PGK1 mRNA in VHL-deficient or wildtype H1299
  cells (VHL−/− or VHL+/+) cultured under normoxia (21% O2). Data show mean ± SD;
  Student’s two tailed t-test; ***p < 0.001; Data from 3 independent experiments.
  G qPCR analysis of PDK1, PGK1, LDHA, VEGF and PKM2 mRNA in VHL-deficient H1299 cells
  (VHL−/−) transfected with or without Flag-OTUB1 and cultured under normoxia (21%
  O2) for 24 h. Flag empty vector was used as a control. Data show mean ± SD; Student’s
  two tailed t-test; ***p < 0.001; Data from 3 independent experiments. H Western
  blot analysis of indicated proteins in FIH-deficient or wildtype HEK293T cells (FIH−/−
  or FIH+/+) cultured under normoxia (21% O2). I–K qPCR analysis of PDK1 (I), PGK1
  (J) and GLUT1 (K) mRNA in FIH-deficient HEK293T cells (FIH −/−) transfected with
  or without Flag-OTUB1 and cultured under normoxia (21% O2) or hypoxia (1% O2) for
  24 h. Flag empty vector was used as a control. Two-way ANOVA analysis; Data show
  mean ± SD; Tukey’s multiple comparisons test; ns, not significant, ****Adjusted
  p < 0.0001; Data from 3 independent experiments.
