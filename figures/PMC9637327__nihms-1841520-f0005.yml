caption: 'Norepinephrine promotes prostate cancer cell migration and invasion mediated
  by FAK. a Cell migration assay of PC-3 cells in the presence of 10 µM norepinephrine,
  10 µM PF562 271 or 10 µM PF562 271 and 10 µM norepinephrine for 36 h. Bar: 500 µm.
  b Cell invasion assay of PC-3 cells in the presence of 10 µM norepinephrine or,
  10 µM PF562 271 or 10 µM PF562 271 and 10 µM norepinephrine for 24 h. Bar: 500 µm.
  c Cell migration assay of shNC and shPTK2 expressing PC-3 cells in the presence
  of 10 µM norepinephrine. Bar: 500 µm. d Cell invasion assay of shNC and shPTK2 expressing
  PC-3 cells in the presence of 10 µM norepinephrine. Bar: 500 µm. e Staining of pY118
  paxillin with anti-pY118 paxilin antibody and F-actin with phalloidin of shNC and
  shPTK2 expressing PC-3 cells incubated with 10 µM norepinephrine for 18 h. Bar:
  5 µm. f Western blot analysis of shNC and shPTK2 expressing PC-3 cells treated with
  10 µM norepinephrine for 10 minutes. g MMP2 and MMP9 mRNA of shNC and shPTK2 expressing
  PC-3 cells after incubation with 10 µM norepinephrine for 6 h assessed by qRT-PCR.
  The results were representative of three independent experiments conducted in triplicate'
