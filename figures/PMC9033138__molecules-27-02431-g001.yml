caption: (A) The chemical structure of Nigrosporins B; (B) The Cytotoxicity of Nigrosporins
  B on Ca Ski, A549, HepG2, HGC-27, MDA-MB-231, CNE2, MDCK and Marc-145, the cells
  were treated with Nigrosporins B of different concentrations (50, 25, 12.5, 6.25,
  3.125, 1.56, 0.78 ÂµM) for 48 h, and cell viability was measured by MTT assay; (C)
  The IC50 of Nigrosporins B on Ca Ski, A549, HepG2, HGC-27, MDA-MB-231, CNE2, MDCK,
  Marc-145.
