figure_title: High TRAF2 expression is associated with poor prognosis of HCC patients
caption: 'A The expression of TRAF2 mRNA level in HL7702 liver cell and HCC cell lines
  was determined by qPCR. Levels of significance: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001,
  (Student’s t-test). B TRAF2 protein levels in eight paired HCC clinical samples
  were detected by western blot. T: tumor tissue, A: adjacent non-tumor tissue. C,
  D HCC tissue microarrays containing 171 tumor tissues and corresponding tumor-adjacent
  normal tissues were stained for TRAF2 expression. IHC score was calculated via multiplying
  the percentage score by the intensity score [, ]. (***p < 0.001, Student’s t-test,
  two-tailed, mean ± SEM). E Representative images from immunohistochemical staining
  of TRAF2, Scale bar = 20 μm. F The correlation between TRAF2 expression and overall
  survival in HCC patients (p = 0.0002, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis). G The correlation
  between TRAF2 and p62 expression and overall survival of HCC patients (p < 0.0001,
  Kaplan-Meier survival analysis).'
article_title: The TRAF2-p62 axis promotes proliferation and survival of liver cancer
  by activating mTORC1 pathway.
