caption: The mode of action by which PP2A regulated the expression of metabolic enzymes.A,
  the upstream regulators for the metabolic DEGs were predicted by IPA program. The
  percentage of upstream regulators was shown in a pie chart. The numbers of metabolic
  enzymes targeted by top 20 transcriptional regulators were shown. B, the predicted
  associations between PP2A and 56 transcription factors with specific Ser/Thr phosphorylation
  sites. The schematic diagram illustrated candidate phosphorylated transcription
  factors regulated by PP2A directly or indirectly. C, heatmap of hyperphosphorylated
  metabolic enzymes and respective phosphorylation sites in HO mice relative to WT
  mice. DEG, differentially expressed gene; HO, homozygous knockout; IPA, Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A.
