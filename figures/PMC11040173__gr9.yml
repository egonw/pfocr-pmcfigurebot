caption: Schematic overview of the putative mechanism by which iron overload affect
  the proliferation and differentiation of ISCs. Schematic intestinal epithelia and
  mesenchymal cells are depicted top left. Schematic organoid is depicted top right.
  The schemata was created with BioRender.com.
article_title: Differentiation of intestinal stem cells toward goblet cells under
  systemic iron overload stress are associated with inhibition of Notch signaling
  pathway and ferroptosis.
