caption: 'CHI3L1 is a potential mediator of the reactive astrocyte state by enhancing
  the pro‐inflammatory NF‐ĸB signalling pathway. (A, B) Liquid chromatography/mass
  spectrometry analysis of CSF from MS patients with inflammatory activity (MS‐High;
  N = 9), low inflammatory activity (MS‐Low; N = 9) and non‐inflammatory neurological
  controls (NINC; N = 9). (A) Heatmap and (B) volcano plots showing normalised Log2
  protein expression satisfying p‐value < .01 and absolute FC > 0.5 identifying upregulation
  of CHI3L1 in MS‐High CSF (inset). (C) Plots showing bioinformatic annotation analysis
  integrating CSF, reactive astrocytes and astrocytic secretome data sets of the MS‐High
  condition. ERK1/2 cascade (p = 4.7 × 10–11), NIK/NF‐ĸB signalling (p = .004) and
  Nfkb1 (FDR = 5.3 × 10–8) exhibit substantial changes, pointing to enhanced NF‐ĸB
  signalling. (D) Flowchart illustrating primary purified astrocyte cultures stimulated
  with either PBS (Vehicle) or CHI3L1 at 300 and 600 ng/ml, using the same exposure
  conditions as previously in the CSF stimulation experiments. (E) qPCR assessment
  of CHI3L1 stimulation. The 600 ng/ml CHI3L1 concentration induces a reduced expression
  of Nr4a1 (p = .03) and Klf6 (p = .02). Individual values represent average FC = 2–(average
  ∆∆Ct) in mRNAs in CHI3L1‐stimulated astrocytes relative to vehicle. Least Squares
  Means Estimates test and Tukey–Kramer multiple comparisons test; n = 8 independent
  biological samples per group. (F) Network diagram of differentially regulated contributors
  of enhanced NF‐ĸB signalling in MS‐High‐exposed reactive astrocytes predict CHI3L1
  as an upstream regulator of astrocyte reactivity (p = 3.5 × 10–5). (G) A node of
  interaction between Mapk3 (ERK1), Mapk1 (ERK2), Trp53 and Nr4a1 in the NF‐ĸB transcription
  module may potentially be regulated by CHI3L1 and would also affect Serpine1 expression
  (p = .0002). (H) Illustrative confocal images of P7 murine organotypic brain slices
  treated at 7 DIV with either PBS (Vehicle) or CHI3L1 (600 ng/ml) for 48 h. Neurons
  were immunostained with neurofilament heavy chain (NFh, green) and DAPI (blue).
  Graphs represent individual data of averaged NFh area (μm2) per stack in each field
  of view (FOV). Least Squares Means Estimates test; n = 7 mice (Vehicle, n = 6).
  Data in E and H are shown as mean (SEM). *p < .05. Scale bar: 30 μm (H). DIV: days
