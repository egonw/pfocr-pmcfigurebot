caption: SWAP70 interacts with TAK1 and inhibits its activation. (A) Coimmunoprecipitation
  (CO‐IP) assays performed the interaction between Flag‐SWAP70 and various upstream
  molecules of the MAPK pathway (n = 3 independent experiments). (B,C) The protein
  levels of phosphorylated and total TAK1 in liver tissues from indicated groups with
  HFHC diet (n = 3/group). (D,E) Phosphorylated and total TAK1 protein level in L02
  cells with SWAP70 knockdown (D) or overexpression (E) under PA stimulation for 0,
  3, 6, or 12 hours (n = 3 independent experiments). (F) Colocalization of TAK1 (red)
  and SWAP70 (green) in HEK 293T cells transfected with Flag‐TAK1 and HA‐SWAP70 plasmids
  (n = 3 independent experiments). Scale bar, 10 μm. (G) CO‐IP assay performed the
  interaction between HA‐SWAP70 and Flag‐TAK1 in HEK 293T cells (n = 3 independent
  experiments). (H) CO‐IP assays performed the interaction between Flag‐SWAP70 and
  endogenous TAK1 or Flag‐TAK1 and endogenous SWAP70 in L02 hepatocytes (n = 3 independent
  experiments). (I) CO‐IP assays performed the interaction between Flag‐SWAP70 and
  endogenous TAK1 in primary hepatocytes (n = 3 independent experiments). (J) GST
  precipitation assays show direct binding of SWAP70 and TAK1, purified GST as control
  (n = 3 independent experiments). (K) The binding domains of TAK1 and SWAP70 were
  explored by using Flag‐SWAP70 and either full‐length or truncated TAK1. Above, schematic
  diagram of truncated TAK1; below, western blot bands (n = 3 independent experiments).
