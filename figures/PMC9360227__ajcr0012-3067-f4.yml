caption: PI3K inhibitors with or without trastuzumab induce down-regulation of phospho-AKT,
  phospho-S6, and apoptosis. A. HCC1954, UACC893, and HCC1569 cells were treated with
  the indicated agents. Lysates were collected 24 hours after treatment. The cells
  treated with alpelisib and alpelisib plus trastuzumab showed down-regulation of
  phospho-AKT and phospho-S6. Within the same groups, overexpression of cleaved-PARP
  and cleaved-caspase 3 were observed. The control and trastuzumab groups did not
  show the above protein cleavage. B. Three breast cancer cell lines were treated
  with the indicated agents. GDC-0077 with or without trastuzumab contributed to down-regulation
  of phospho-AKT and phospho-S6, and up-regulation of cleaved-PARP and cleaved-caspase
  3, whereas the other two groups did not. The trastuzumab concentration was 2 μg/mL.
  The alpelisib concentrations were 2, 0.5, and 4 μM for HCC1954, UACC893, and HCC1569
  cells, respectively. The GDC-0077 concentrations were 0.8, 0.4, and 3.2 μM for HCC1954,
  UACC893, and HCC1569 cells, respectively. Numbers under each western blot represent
  the intensity of the protein relative to the control.
