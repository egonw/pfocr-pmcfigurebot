figure_title: Dragline silk origin and the functional character of the Ma gland segments
caption: a Schematic illustration of Ma gland segmentation. b Sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide
  gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) (left) and LC–MS (right) analyses of dragline silk
  protein. iBAQ, intensity-based absolute quantification. Similar results were obtained
  in three independent experiments and summarized in Source data. c Classification
  of the identified metabolites in dragline silk. d LC–MS analyses of the metabolites.
  e LC–MS analyses of the golden extract from T. clavata dragline silk. The golden
  pigment was extracted with 80% methanol. The extracted ion chromatograms (EICs)
  showed a peak at m/z 206 [M + H]+ for xanthurenic acid. f Pearson correlation of
  different Ma gland segments (Tail, Sac, and Duct). g Expression clustering of the
  Tail, Sac, and Duct. The transcriptomic data were clustered according to the hierarchical
  clustering (HC) method. h Combinational analysis of the transcriptome and proteome
  showing the expression profile of the dragline silk genes in the Tail, Sac, and
  Duct. i Concise biosynthetic pathway of xanthurenic acid (tryptophan metabolism)
  in the T. clavata Ma gland. Gene expression levels mapped to tryptophan metabolism
  are shown in three segments of the Ma gland. Enzymes involved in the pathway are
  indicated in red, and the genes encoding the enzymes are shown beside them. j Gene
  Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of Ma gland segment-specific genes indicating
  the biological functions of the Tail, Sac, and Duct. The top 12 significantly enriched
  GO terms are shown for each segment of the Ma gland. A P-value <0.05 was set as
  the criterion for screening significantly enriched GO terms. Source data are provided
  as a Source Data file.
