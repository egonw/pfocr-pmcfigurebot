caption: 'Global changes in gene expression and RNA splicing associated with expression
  of mutant PIK3CA signaling. A, Venn diagram overlap of differentially expressed
  genes having a FDR adjusted P < 0.05 and absolute fold change > 0.2 among comparisons:
  mutant vs. parental, mutant + alpelisib vs. mutant, and parental + alpelisib vs.
  parental MCF10A cells. B, Scatter plot of gene expression log2-fold changes in MCF10A
  mutant vs. parental on the x-axis and mutant + alpelisib vs. mutant on the y-axis.
  Red dots, significantly differential genes (FDR < 0.05 and absolute fold change
  > 0.2); gray points, nonsignificantly differential genes. Pearson correlation coefficient
  r is shown for all points in gray or significantly differential genes, red points.
  C, C2 Reactome mRNA splicing pathway enrichment in the indicated comparisons. D,
  Scatter plot of JunctionSeq log2-fold changes showing mutant vs. parental on x-axis
  and mutant + inhibitor vs. mutant MCF10A cells on y-axis; events significant in
  PI3K-activation and PI3K-inhibition groups or only in PI3K-activation, or only PI3K-inhibition
  groups are red, orange, and blue, respectively. E, Venn overlap of genes containing
  significantly differential exonic regions. The intersection of the same significantly
  differential exonic regions having opposite log2-fold change in mutant vs. parental
  and mutant + alpelisib vs. mutant was assigned to 188 unique genes. F, The percentage
  of alternatively spliced isoforms was annotated using 8 possible transcriptional
  events. MES, multiple exon skipping; ATSS, alternative transcription start site;
  ATTS, alternative transcription termination site; ES, exon skipping; IR, intron
  retention; A3, alternative 3′ splice sites; A5, alternative 5′ splice sites; MEE,
  mutually exclusive exons. G, An MA plot of isoforms. Red points, significantly differential
  isoforms; blue points, nonsignificant alternatively spliced isoforms. Validated
  candidates are labeled with isoform names.'
