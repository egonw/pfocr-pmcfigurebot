caption: 'Belgian patient pathway for (RSV)-bronchiolitis based on a questionnaire
  among Belgian generalists and specialists in the domain of RSV (CVA, 2021). There
  are 3 layers to consider in the management and treatment of RSV infections in Belgium:
  the primary care setting, the hospitalized child and the follow-up phase. Parents
  first seek advice in primary care setting, severe RSV infections are referred to
  the ER and can lead to hospitalization or admission to PICU. Post-hospitalization
  visits are common. It is estimated that around 3500 Belgian children between 0 and
  12 months are hospitalized for bronchiolitis on a yearly basis, 5% of those would
  be transferred to ICU. (Data on file, Sanofi, Questionnaire on burden of RSV disease
  in Belgium, conducted by CVA, 2021)'
