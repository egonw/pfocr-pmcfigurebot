caption: 'Neuregulin-1 type III/ERBB2/3/AKT/mTOR pathway is upregulated in CMT4H models.
  (A and B) Phosphorylated ERBB2 (P-ERBB2) and AKT (P-AKT) as well as mTOR expression
  are significantly increased in Fgd4SC–/– co-cultures compared to control. (A) Levels
  of expression of P-ERBB2, ERBB2, P-AKT, AKT and mTOR were assessed by western blot
  analysis. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM (n = 3–4 co-cultures) and normalized
  to the control values. Statistical analysis: unpaired Student’s t-test. (B) Western
  blot pictures illustrating the expression of the markers described in A. (C and
  D) Levels of expression of P-ERBB2, ERBB2, P-AKT, AKT and mTOR were assessed by
  western blot analysis in the sciatic nerves of Fgd4–/– mice compared to WT mice.
  (C) Data are expressed as mean ± SEM (n = 3 animals per genotype). Statistical analysis:
  unpaired Student’s t-test. (D) Western blot pictures illustrating the expression
  of the markers described in C. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.'
