caption: Effects of signaling pathway inhibitors on proliferation and galvanotaxis
  of HROC383 cells. (A–D) HROC383 cells growing in 96-well half-area microplates were
  treated with AKT inhibitors MK-2206 or capivasertib, MEK inhibitor trametinib, or
  STAT3 inhibitor niclosamide at the indicated doses for 48 h, before DNA synthesis
  was assessed with the BrdU incorporation assay. One hundred percent BrdU incorporation
  corresponds to cells cultured with solvent only. Data are presented as mean ± SEM
  (n ≥ 12 separate cultures); * p < 0.05 versus control cultures (Kruskal–Wallis test
  with post hoc Dunn’s test). (E) The velocities of tumor cells under DCEF conditions
  (200 V/m, 6 h) and control conditions. Cells were treated with inhibitors or solvent
  (DMSO), respectively, at the indicated doses. Data are represented as mean velocity
  ± SEM. As illustrated in the columns, 120 cells for each experimental group from
  three independent experiments were analyzed; * p < 0.05 versus control w/o DC (Kruskal–Wallis
  test with post hoc Dunn’s test). (F) The pole-directed migration was estimated,
  and total X-dimension migration was calculated. * p < 0.05 vs. control cultures
  w/o DC; n.s., no significant difference; (Kruskal–Wallis test with post hoc Dunn’s
  test).
