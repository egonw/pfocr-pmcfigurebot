caption: 'The AKT pathway, but not the ERK1/2 and STAT3 pathways, is inactivated in
  CD109 KO SCC cells, while in control SCC cells, EGFR kinase inhibition phenocopies
  AKT inhibition in inducing cell death and CD109KO-like mesenchymal state. (A): Western
  blot analysis for the indicated proteins in control A431 cells and CD109KO A431
  clones. (B): Representative images of Toluidine blue staining for control A431 cells
  and CD109 109KO A431 treated with or without 10 μM TGF-β inhibitor SB431542 for
  72 h. (C): Western blot analysis of cells in for the indicated proteins. (D,E):
  Representative images of Toluidine blue staining for control A431 cells and CD109KO
  A431 cells treated with or without as 5 μM/L EGFR inhibitor AG1478 (D) or AKT inhibitor
  MK2206 (E). (F,G): Western blot analysis of the control A431 and CD109KO A431 cells
  treated with or without 5 μM/L AG1478 (F) or 5 μM/L MK2206 (G) for 20 h. All the
  results were repeated in three independent experiments. Scale bar: 50 µm. Uncropped
  WB images were shown in .'
