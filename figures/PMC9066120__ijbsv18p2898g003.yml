caption: 'MHO7-induced ROS generation contributed to ER stress-mediated apoptosis.
  (A) The ROS level was detected by flow cytometry when treated with MHO7 for 24 h
  or pretreated with NAC (4 mM) for 1 h in MDA-MB-231 cells. (B) GSH /GSSG ratio of
  MDA-MB-231 cells was detected under the treatment of MHO7 (2, 3 µM) and pretreatment
  of NAC (4 mM). (C) The percentages of apoptosis cells were measured by flow cytometry
  when treated with MHO7 for 24 h or pretreated with NAC (4 mM) for 1 h in MDA-MB-231
  cells. (D) ER stress-related proteins were measured by western blot under the treatment
  of MHO7 (+: 2 µM; ++:3 µM) or pretreated with NAC (4 mM) in MDA-MB-231 cells. (E)
  Intracytoplasmic calcium ionic was detected by flow cytometry after the treatment
  of MHO7 in MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 cells. *P <0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P <0.001; and ****P
  < 0.0001.'
