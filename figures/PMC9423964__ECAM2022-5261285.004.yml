caption: The response experiment proved that the overexpression of miR-144-3p reversed
  the promotion effect of UBL7-AS1 on glioma. (a) Detection of the expression level
  of miR-144-3p in U251 cells. (b) Detection of the expression level of miR-144-3p
  in U118MG cells. (c) CCK-8 detection of the U251 cell proliferation test. (d) CCK-8
  detection of theU118MG cell proliferation test. (e) U251 cell invasion experiment
  after different treatments. (f) U118MG cell invasion experiment after different
  treatments. Data are presented as the mean ± SD. ∗∗P < 0.01.
