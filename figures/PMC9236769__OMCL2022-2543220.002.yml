caption: 'DJ-1 induced of angiogenesis and migration in ECDHCC-1 cells. (a) DJ-1 secretion
  in HCC cells. HepG2 and HUH-7 cells were seeded for culture medium (CM) collection.
  The CM was harvested and examined by ELISA for DJ-1 expression after 24 and 48 h.
  (b) Purification of DJ-1 as indicated in the elution lane. (c and d) Product verification
  of DJ-1 by western blotting analysis with anti-His tag (c) and anti-DJ-1 (d) specific
  antibody was performed, respectively. (e–g) Fluorescence microscopy imaging of capillary
  tube formation (e) and quantification of DJ-1 induced tube nodes (f) and tube length
  (g) using tube formation assay were conducted. (h and i) Wound healing image (h)
  and quantification of the relative scratch width (i) of ECDHCC-1 cells induced by
  DJ-1 were analyzed. Con: Control group. ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 versus Con. (original
  magnifications: ×200 for fluorescence).'
