caption: 'The effect of Chaigui granule on protein expression of CYP19A1-E2-ERK1/ERK2
  pathway in the hippocampus. (A) The protein expression of AR in the hippocampus.
  (B) The protein expression of CYP19A1 in the hippocampus. (C) The protein expression
  of ERα in the hippocampus. (D) The protein expression of ERβ in the hippocampus.
  (E) The ratio of ERK1 and ERK2 protein expression in the hippocampus. (F) The ratio
  of p-ERK1 and p-ERK2 (G) protein expression in the hippocampus. All data were expressed
  as mean ± SD. #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01 compared with Control group. ✻p < 0.05, ✻✻p
  < 0.01 compared with Model group.'
