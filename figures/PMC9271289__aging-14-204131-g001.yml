caption: HCC cells resistance to HDACis correlated with downregulation of CRT. (A)
  Liver cancer cells are incubated with apicidin at various concentrations for 48
  h and proliferation measured by MTT assay. (B) Liver cancer cells are incubated
  with SAHA at various concentrations for 48 h and proliferation measured by MTT assay.
  Data are expressed as percentage of the control and presented as mean Â± S.D. of
  three independent experiments. (C) Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis
  of proteins extracted from liver cancer cells, and further identification of candidate
  protein, calreticulin (CRT), by tandem mass spectrometer. (D, E) Western blotting
  and reverse transcription PCR analysis indicate decreased expression of CRT in HDACis-R
  cells than that in HA22T parental cells at protein and mRNA levels. Protein and
  mRNA expression are normalized to expression of GAPDH. *p <0.05, **p <0.01, ***p
  <0.001 compared with parental cell group.
