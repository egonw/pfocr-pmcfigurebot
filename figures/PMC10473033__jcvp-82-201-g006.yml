caption: 'Effects of sRLX on LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines. The gene levels of
  IL-1β (A), IL-6 (C), TNF-α (E), and IL-10 (G) were determined with qRT-PCR. Culture
  supernatants were collected to evaluate the protein level of IL-1β (B), IL-6 (D),
  TNF-α (F), and IL-10 (H) by ELISA. Date are shown as mean ± SD of relative quantification
  from 5 independent experiments. *P < 0.05 versus control group, #P < 0.05 versus
  LPS group. &P < 0.05 versus LPS + sRLX group. GW, GW9662.'
