caption: Functional enrichment and pathway analyses. (A) Volcano plot of 560 DEGs.
  Upregulated immune-related DEGs with p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1 in the low-risk group
  are presented (left). (B) Venn diagram of DEGs and IRGs. (C) The top 10 GO terms
  in molecular function (MF), cellular component (CC), and biological process (BP).
  (D) The top 30 enriched KEGG pathways. (E) Most significant GSEA sets, from GO-related
  MSigDB, associated with the low-risk group. (F) Most significant GSEA sets, from
  KEGG-related MSigDB, associated with the low-risk group. DEG, differentially expressed
  gene; FC, fold change; IRG, immune-related gene; GO, Gene Ontology; KEGG, Kyoto
  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; GSEA, gene set enrichment analysis; MSigDB, The
  Molecular Signatures Database.
