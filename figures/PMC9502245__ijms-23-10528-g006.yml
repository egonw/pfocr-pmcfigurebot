caption: Effect of α-Bisabolol on the intrinsic apoptosis pathway in the kidney of
  normal and DOX-injected rats. (A). Representative images of Western immunoblot analysis
  for Bax, Bcl2, Bcl-xL, procaspase-3, active caspase-3, procaspase-9, active caspase-9,
  cytochrome-C. Immunoblotting analysis was done in duplicates. (B). Densitometric
  analysis of renal protein expressions of Bax, Bcl2, Bcl-xL, active caspase-3, active
  caspase-9, cytochrome-C. DOX-injected rats showed significant (p < 0.05) increase
  in the renal protein expressions of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, cleaved caspase-3,
  cleaved caspase-9 and cytochrome-C) with considerable (p < 0.05) decrease in the
  expressions of anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl2 and Bcl-xL) compared to normal control
  rats. Meanwhile, α-Bisabolol treatment to DOX-injected rats significantly (p < 0.05)
  downregulates the renal protein expressions of Bax, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9,
  and cytochrome-C with significant (p < 0.05) increase in the expression of renal
  Bcl2 and Bcl-xL compared to DOX-alone injected rats. Columns not sharing a common
  symbol (*, **) differ significantly with each other (* p < 0.05 vs. normal control,
  ** p < 0.05 vs. DOX control).
