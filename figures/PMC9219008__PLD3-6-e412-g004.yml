caption: Expression of upstream genes in the cannabinoid biosynthetic pathway over
  the course of 7‐week flower development. (a, c, e) Expression of GPPS, TKS, and
  OAC in CW. (b, d, f) Expression of GPPS, TKS, and OAC in GG. Data are presented
  as means ± SE (n = 4). Significant difference of P < .05 (*), P < .01 (**), and
  P < .001 (***) was determined by comparing to week 1 using Student's t test
