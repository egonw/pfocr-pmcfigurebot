figure_title: MyD88 Signaling Leads to Cell Specific Functions in Cardiovascular Disease
caption: Alarmins are recognized by TLRs and cytokine receptors, leading to activation
  of MyD88 and a subsequent immune response, along with cell specific functions (right
  panel). The MyD88 independent pathway contributes in parallel. The gene structure
  and domains of MyD88 are shown in the lower right panel. (DD = Death domain, Int
  = Intermediate domain, TIR = Toll-IL1R domain)
