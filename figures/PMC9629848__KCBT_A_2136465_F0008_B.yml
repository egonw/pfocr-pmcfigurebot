caption: The significance of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis in the interactions of EFEMP2
  with STEAP2 and its functions in EMT. By western-blot (a) and its relative gray
  value (b), the EMT process induced by EFEMP2 or STEAP2 over-expression was significantly
  inhibited after Akt down-regulation, and the pathway was inactivated, along with
  the E-cadherin up-expression, the N-cadherin and Vimentin down-expression, and reduced
  phosphorylation level of AKT. By western-blot (c) and its relative gray value (d),
  the lowly invasive osteosarcoma subclone MG63-31 cells were treated with purified
  EFEMP2 (100, 200, and 300 ng/ml) for 24 h. With the increase in EFEMP2 concentration,
  the expression of E-cadherin declined progressively, while the N-cadherin and vimentin
  levels were elevated progressively. Besides, there was elicitation of EMT, along
  with enhanced phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR. By western-blot (e) and its relative
  gray value (f), for osteosarcoma cells with the repression of either STEAP2 or Akt
  or both, purified EFEMP2 could not activate Akt pathway or EMT in the osteosarcoma
  cells. In other words, the down-regulated expression of STEAP2 or Akt blocked EFEMP2
  from promoting the EMT process in osteosarcoma cells. *P < .05.
