caption: Effect of rutin on gamma secretase mediated Notch signaling pathway inhibition
  in colon cancer sphere forming cells. (A) Reduction in colony formation ability
  of HCT-116 cells at IC30 and IC50 concentrations of rutin/Notch-1 siRNA treatment.
  (B) mRNA expression of Hes-1 and Hey-1 at IC30 and IC50 concentrations of rutin
  in HTC-116 derived colonospheres (Hey-1 decrease was not observed with Rutin IC30).
  (C) mRNA expression of Hes-1 and Hey-1 in Notch-1 siRNA treated HCT-116 derived
  colonospheres. (D) Expression of NICD and Hes-1 in derived colonospheres at rutin
  IC30 and IC50 concentrations at protein level. (E) mRNA expression of Nanog, Sox2,
  CD44, and c-Myc in HCT-116 derived colonospheres at rutin IC30 and IC50 concentrations.
  (F) mRNA expression of Nanog, Sox2, CD44 c-Myc in Notch-1 siRNA treated HCT-116
  derived colonospheres. (G) Protein expression of c-Myc in HCT-116 derived colonospheres
  at rutin IC30 and IC50 concentrations. Experiments were performed in triplicate
  and represented by mean Â± SEM (standard error mean). *** (p < 0.001).
