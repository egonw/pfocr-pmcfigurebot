caption: Gene enrichment analysis. (a, b) The GO functional enrichment analysis. Differentially
  expressed genes were mainly related to transmembrane transport across the cell membrane
  and receptor exchange. (c, d) The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. They were mainly
  enriched in the calcium signaling, cAMP signaling, ECM-receptor interaction, focal
  adhesion, and Wnt signaling pathways.
