caption: Three T-DNA insertion lines were identified in the OsAux1 gene. (A) Schematic
  representation of T-DNA insertion mutations in osaux1-1, osaux1-2, and osaux1-3
  in the OsAux1 gene. The open arrow heads represent T-DNA insertion positions. Filled
  white boxes represent exons; black boxes represent untranslated region; black lines
  represent introns. (B) Detection of RT-PCR of OsAuxX1 transcripts in WT (Dongjin)
  osaux1-1, osaux1-2, and osaux1-3; actin transcripts were amplified as a control.
  (C) Seven-day phenotypic comparison of grown seedlings of wild-type (Dongjin), mutant
  lines osaux1-3, and (B) cereus-inoculated under Cd treatment. Scale bar, 1 cm. (D)
  Root hair morphology of (B) cereus-inoculated and noninoculated wild-type and osaux1-3
  after 3 days of treatment with 200 µM CdCl2 using Nikon AZ100. Scale bar, 1 mm.
  (E) Focused image of osaux1-3 mutant under control. (F) Root phenotype quantification
  of PR length, LR root number, and RH length in wild-type and mutant lines grown
  in Cd bacterial-inoculated and noninoculated (controlled) conditions. Five seedlings
  from each of three replicates were assessed and grown for 10 days. Lowercase letters
  indicate significant differences between means, determined using Duncan’s multiple
  range mean comparisons.

  in rice by interacting with the indole-3-acetic acid–amido synthetase gene, promoting
  root hair development under cadmium stress.
