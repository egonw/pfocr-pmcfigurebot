caption: Impact of neutrophils on the progression and metastasis of pancreatic cancer.
  Obesity-induced inflammation and TAN infiltration activate PSCs, leading to connective
  tissue proliferation in the TME and promoting tumor growth. Conversely, PSCs can
  also recruit TANs. Neutrophils produce HMGB1 in pancreatic cancer, which induces
  the epithelial-mesenchymal transformation of pancreatic cancer. Moreover, neutrophils
  can also secrete elastase to degrade E-cadherin on pancreatic cancer cells, resulting
  in the enhanced migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells. In a mouse metastatic
  tumor model, NRF2 activity in P2RX1 negative neutrophils is elevated, leading to
  metabolic reprogramming during polarization. As a result, CD8+ T cells are inhibited,
  and tumor immune escape is mediated. NETs are upregulated in pancreatic cancer through
  a RAGE dependent and autophagy mediated pathway. NETs enhance the migration of hepatic
  stellate cells, activate cancer-associated fibroblasts, and promote hepatic metastasis
  of pancreatic cancer. Neutrophils are also involved in pancreatic cancer vascular
  endothelial cell integrity damage and promote metastasis of pancreatic cancer cells.
