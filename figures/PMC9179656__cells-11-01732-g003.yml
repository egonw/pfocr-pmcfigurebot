caption: Five major developing α-Syn-targeting therapeutic strategies. They include
  reducing α-Syn transcription (1) and translation (2), inhibiting α-Syn aggregation
  by disaggregators involving low-molecular-weight compounds identified by high-throughput
  screening and rationally designed peptides or peptidomimetics (3), enhancing α-Syn
  clearance and degradation through autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome system
  (4), and capturing the toxic α-Syn forms in the extracellular space and blocking
  their transcellular spreading via immunotherapies (5).
