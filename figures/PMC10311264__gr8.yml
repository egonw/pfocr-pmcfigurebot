caption: ISGs mRNA level of type II IFN signaling is associated with FMDV 3C protease
  activity in degrading KPNA1. HeLa cells cotransfected with increased dose of pXJ41-FLAG-KPNA1
  and pXJ41-3C or its mutants were treated with 100 ​-ng/mL human IFN-γ at 24 ​h post-transfection.
  5 h later, the mRNA levels of hGBP1 (A), hISG15 (B), hISG56 (C), hOAS (D) and hPKR
  (E) were detected by real-time RT-PCR as described above. Data represent the mean ​± ​the
  standard deviations (error bars) of three independent experiments. F Expression
  of KPNA1, 3C or its mutant protein was measured by Western blotting using antibody
  against FLAG or HA. β-actin was used as a protein loading control. ∗, P ​< ​0.05.
