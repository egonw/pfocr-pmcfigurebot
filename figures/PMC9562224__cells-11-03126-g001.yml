caption: CPP induces the differentiation of HDFs into vascular endothelial cells by
  increasing levels of HIF-1α. (a–d) HDFs were treated with CPP (0, 1, 10 or 20 μM)
  for 6 days (D6) or 10 days (D10), after which Western blot analysis was used to
  measure the protein level of HIF-1α. β-actin (ACTB) was used as a loading control.
  (e) HDFs were treated with CPP (0 or 10 μM) for 6 days (D6), after which qRT-PCR
  was used to detect the mRNA level of HIF-1α. (f,g) In the presence or absence of
  cycloheximide (CHX, 10 μg/mL), HDFs were treated with 10 μM CPP for 48 h, after
  which the protein level of HIF-1α was detected by Western blot. β-actin (ACTB) was
  used as a loading control. (h–p) HDFs were pretreated with LW6, an inhibitor of
  HIF-1α, for 12 h, and then treated with CPP (10 μM) for 6 days (D6), and protein
  levels of CD31, HIF-1α, VEGF, FGF-2, Collagen 1 and Vimentin were determined by
  Western blot. β-actin (ACTB) was used as a loading control. Data are presented as
  means ± SEM, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, n = 3.
