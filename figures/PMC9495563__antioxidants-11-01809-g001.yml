caption: 'Histopathological examination of the livers of golden pompano infected with
  S. agalactiae. Notes: (A) represents a normal liver tissue section, HE, bar = 50 µm;
  (B–D) Representative liver tissue sections from three fish at 120 h of infection,
  respectively, HE, bar = 50 µm. a, liver sample in which liver cell boundaries were
  not well defined; b, liver sample with enlarged and severely displaced cells; c,
  liver sample exhibiting hepatic cytoplasmic lysis; d, liver sample exhibiting amyloidosis
  in the cells surrounding the hepatic sinusoids and cloudy eosinophilic staining
  of the cytoplasm; e–f, liver sample in which the cell membrane was disintegrated
  and the cells joined together, creating the illusion of binucleation; g, liver sample
  exhibiting multifocal necrosis.'
