caption: Human phosphokinase array analysis. The HL-60 cells were treated with the
  test samples i.e. P3 (20 μg/ml) and 0.18% DMSO (Vehicle control, VC) for 96 h at
  37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. The cell lysates prepared at 96 h post-treatment
  were analyzed for phosphorylation status of different kinases using a human phospho-kinase
  antibody array kit (ARY003B, R&D systems). Only the kinases that showed significant
  change in their phosphorylation status are shown. Data represent the mean ± SD of
  two independent experiments, with each antibody spotted in duplicate. Student’s
  t-test was employed to determine statistical significance (p value) with respect
  to vehicle-treated control cells. *p ≤ 0.05; **p ≤ 0.01; ***p ≤ 0.001
