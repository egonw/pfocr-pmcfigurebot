caption: 'Parathyroid hormone-related peptide increases the protein expression of
  Met and parathyroid hormone receptor type 1 in tumor xenografts. Met and parathyroid
  hormone-related peptide receptor type 1 (PTHR1) protein levels were evaluated by
  the immunohistochemistry technique in the HCT116 cell tumor-bearing nude mouse model.
  Tumor sections were stained with an anti-Met antibody or anti-PTHR1 antibody. Images
  (400 ×) are from the tumor treated with saline solution (left) or with PTHrP (right).
  The immunostaining was quantified with the Fiji image processing package of the
  Image J-NIH program. Scale bar: 50 μM. Met: Receptor tyrosine kinase Met; PTHR1:
  Parathyroid hormone receptor type 1; PTHrP: Parathyroid hormone-related peptide.
  aP < 0.05; bP < 0.01.'
article_title: Involvement of Met receptor pathway in aggressive behavior of colorectal
  cancer cells induced by parathyroid hormone-related peptide.
