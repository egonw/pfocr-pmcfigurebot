caption: a KEGG pathway enrichment in the duodenum, colon, and liver. Up-regulated
  pathways in the S1 stage are shown on the left, and up-regulated pathways in the
  S2 stage are shown on the right. b KEGG pathway enrichment of metabolites with significant
  and robust correlations in the bamboo-eating stage (Spearman coefficient r > 0.6,
  FDR p < 0.05). c Scatter plot representing the relationship between linoleic acid
  (up), arachidonic acid (down) with animal ages. The correlations between metabolites
  and bamboo-eating stage are shown as Spearman coefficients. d Schematic map of linoleic
  acid metabolic pathway in the liver. Up-regulated genes and metabolites in the S2
  stage are marked in red.
