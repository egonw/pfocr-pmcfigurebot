caption: JIB-04 blocks cell cycle progression by regulating the AKT/FOXO/RB axis.
  (A) Protein expressions of AKT in three different HCC cell lines after treatment
  with increasing doses of JIB-04 or DMSO (control) for 24h. GAPDH was used as a loading
  control. (B) Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of FOXO3a in PLC/PRF/5 and HepG2 cells
  after treatment with increasing doses of JIB-04 or DMSO (control) for 24h. Nucleus
  and cytosolic fractions were separately isolated and subjected to Western blot analysis
  using an anti-FOXO3a antibody. GAPDH was used as a cytosolic marker, and H3 was
  used as a nuclear marker. (C) The mRNA expression levels of CDKN1A (p21) in PLC/PRF/5
  and HepG2 cells after treatment with increasing doses of JIB-04 or DMSO (control)
  were analyzed using qRT-PCR. All data are normalized to GAPDH and plotted relative
  to the expression level in control cells. Data are represented as mean ± SEM of
  triplicate measurements; * p < 0.05, and *** p < 0.001. (D) The levels of the phosphorylated
  form and total RB protein in three different HCC cell lines after treatment with
  increasing doses of JIB-04 or DMSO (control) for 24h were examined with Western
  blot analysis. GAPDH was used as a loading control. (E) The mRNA expression levels
  of cell-cycle-related genes, such as CCNE1, CDK1, CCNA2, TK1, and DHFR, in PLC/PRF/5
  and HepG2 cells after treatment with increasing doses of JIB-04 or DMSO (control)
  for 24h were analyzed using qRT-PCR. All data are normalized to GAPDH and plotted
  relative to the expression level in control cells. Data are represented as mean
  ± SEM of triplicate measurements; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001.
