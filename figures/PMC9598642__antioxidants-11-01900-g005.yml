caption: 'Effect of SBP on the synthesis of Type I procollagen by the TGF-β1/Smads
  pathway. (A): Protein bands of related proteins in the TGF-β1/Smads pathway. (B–F)
  TGF-β1, Smad3, p-Smad3, Smad4, and Type I procollagen, respectively. (G) shows the
  p-Smad3/Smad3 in cells under different experiments. In the figure “+” means added,
  “−” means not added. The results are the mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 indicate significant differences compared
  with the various experimental groups.'
