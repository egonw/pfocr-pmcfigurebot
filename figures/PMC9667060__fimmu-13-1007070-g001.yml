caption: Effect of Cytosolic kDNA delivery on in vitro Leishmania infection. (A) AFM
  images of the purified kDNA networks with scanning areas of 5x5 μm (left) and 2.5x2.5
  μm (right). PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells (5x105 cells/ml) were incubated with
  CFSE labeled parasites (5x106 parasites/ml) for 24 hours in the presence or absence
  of kDNA. Percentage of infected cells (B) and total parasite loads (C) were evaluated
  by flow cytometry. Numbers on x-axis labels indicate concentration of kDNA (μg/ml).
  Data represent the average of two independent experiments ± SD. All groups were
  compared statistically by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnet`s multiple comparison
  test. (D) Fluorescence microscopy images of infected, SYTO Green stained THP-1 cells
  (from left to right, 10X 20X and 40X) untreated (upper panels) or treated with 1
  μg/ml kDNA. Images are representatives of two independent experiments. ns=not significant,
