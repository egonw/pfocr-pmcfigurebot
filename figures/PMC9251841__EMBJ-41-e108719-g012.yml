  (ex. 485, em. 600)Average fluorescence lifetime of Flipper‐TR probe quantified using
  fluorescence lifetime imaging microscope (FLIM) (ex. 485, em. 600). HEK293A wild‐type
  and Y/T DKO clones #1 and #2 were labelled with 2 μM Flipper‐TR for 15 min prior
  to imaging. The average lifetime measurements were obtained by fitting the photon
  histogram with a double exponential and the longest lifetime was extracted to report
  plasma membrane tension, as previously described (Colom et al, ). Each dot represents
  fluorescence lifetime of a single cell and data shown are pooled from three independent
  experiments (mean ± 95% CI). Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s post‐hoc. **P = 0.0027

  cyclic hydrostatic pressure in WT and TEAD KO clones. Each dot represents a single
  cell. Data pooled from three independent experiments. Error bars represent mean ± 95%
  CI. Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s post‐hoc. ***P < 0.001 (for both comparisons)
  and P > 0.9999 (TEAD KO #1 vs. #2).WT and Y/T DKO cell volume were measured at steady
  state and the average change in cell volume was quantified using the DHM as in previous
  experiments; these are labelled (−). Cells were then subjected to cyclic hydrostatic
  pressure for 2 h and their cell volume was quantified to determine whether prior
  exposure to hydrostatic pressure (“pre‐conditioning”) would change their cell volume
  response; these are labelled (+). Each dot represents a single cell and error bars
  represent 95% CI. Graphs include data obtained from four independent experiments.

  in cell volume was quantified under the same experimental conditions as in “O”.
  The average change in cell volume in response to cyclic hydrostatic pressure of
  cells with no previous exposure to hydrostatic pressure (labelled as (−)) was quantified
  using DHM and compared to those with prior exposure to hydrostatic pressure (labelled
  (+)). Each dot represents a single cell and error bars represent 95% CI. Graphs
  include data obtained from four independent experiments. Kruskal–Wallis with Dunn’s
  post‐hoc. **P = 0.006 (WT), P = 0.4173 (Y/T DKO) and ns = P > 0.9999.  Source data
