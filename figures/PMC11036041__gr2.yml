caption: 'A: Differentially altered metabolic pathways in urine samples during VMAT
  of patients with cervical cancer (a: pathway impact factor plot of urine samples,
  1: the riboflavin metabolic pathway, 2: the arginine and proline metabolic pathways,
  3: the pyrimidine metabolic pathway, and b–d: box plots of differential molecules
  in the top three metabolic pathways); B: Differentially altered metabolic pathways
  in fecal supernatant samples during VMAT of patients with cervical cancer (a: the
  pathway impact factor plot of fecal supernatant samples, 1: the fatty acid metabolism
  pathway, 2: the amino acid metabolism pathway, 3: the phenylalanine metabolism pathway,
  and b–d: box plots of differential molecules in the top three metabolic pathways);
  and C: Differentially altered metabolic pathways in serum samples during VMAT of
  patients with cervical cancer (a: pathway impact factor plot of peripheral blood
  samples, 1: the AA metabolic pathway, 2: the glutathione metabolic pathway, 3: arginine
  and proline metabolic pathways, and b–d: box plots of differential molecules in
  the top three metabolic pathways. Considering that this study involves four time
  periods, metabolite analysis used one-dimensional analysis of variance to further
  find differential metabolites. A P value of <0.05 indicated statistically significant
  difference. In the box plot of differential metabolites, P values < 0.05 and P values > 0.01
  are represented by *, P values < 0.01 and P values > 0.001 are represented by **,
  and P values < 0.001 are represented by ***.).'
