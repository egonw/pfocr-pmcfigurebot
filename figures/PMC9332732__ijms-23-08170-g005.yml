caption: (A) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) pathways associated with
  the significantly upregulated and downregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
  between particulate matter (PM)-exposed and control (non-PM) rats (p < 0.05). (B)
  Canonical pathways with significant Z-scores (>2) identified using ingenuity pathway
  analysis. Heatmaps showing the DEGs in the (C) cAMP response element-binding protein
  (CREB) and (D) cAMP signaling pathways. (E) Schematic diagram showing the methods
  and criteria for gene analysis. (F) Venn diagram showing the combined DNA methylation
  and transcriptome data. The red circle indicates 67 genes exhibiting hypomethylated/upregulated
  expression. (G) The top five KEGG pathways associated with the hypomethylated/upregulated
  genes.
