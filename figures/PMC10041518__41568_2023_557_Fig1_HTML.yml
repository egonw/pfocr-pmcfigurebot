figure_title: Biosynthetic pathways for pyrimidine and purine nucleotides, relevant
  inhibitors and oncogenic regulators
caption: The biosynthetic pathways leading to pyrimidine (part a) and purine (part
  b) nucleotides are shown. For both pyrimidines and purines, de novo synthesis entails
  a complex series of steps that transform amino acids and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate
  (PRPP) into uridine monophosphate (UMP) or inosine monophosphate (IMP), respectively;
  salvage pathways recycle nucleosides and nucleobases to form nucleoside monophosphates
  (NMPs) or deoxy NMPs in a single step using ATP or PRPP, respectively. The de novo
  synthesis pathways are shown by red arrows and enzymes, and nucleotide salvage pathways
  are shown by blue arrows and enzymes. Inhibitors of these pathways are shown in
  purple boxes. Selected oncogenic regulators that influence these pathways are shown
  in yellow. In addition to the oncogenic regulators shown, the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP) can also be upregulated by the oncogenic factors hypoxia-inducible
  factor 1α (HIF1α), mucin 1 (MUC1), MYC and SREBP1. Dashed inhibitory arrows in part
  b indicate that the inhibitors pemetrexed (Pem) and methotrexate (MTX) inhibit GART
  and ATIC indirectly by disruption of the folic acid cycle. 5,10-MTHF, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate;
