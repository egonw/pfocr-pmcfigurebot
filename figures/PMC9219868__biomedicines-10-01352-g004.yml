caption: Citrate shows p53-independent inhibitory effects on HCT116 cells. (A) HCT116
  WT or HCT116 p53 (-/-) cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of citrate
  for 72 h. Cell growth was measured using a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. (B) HCT116
  p53 (-/-) cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of Citrus limon L.-derived
  nanovesicles for 6 h. Intracellular pH was measured using a BCECF-AM assay. Data
  are means ± standard error measurement; n = 3; * p < 0.05, relative to the PBS (-)
  control. p values were calculated using Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test and
  Sidak’s multiple comparisons test.
