caption: Metformin inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest in endometrial
  carcinoma cells. Ishikawa and RL95-2 cells were incubated with metformin at different
  concentrations (0, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mM for Ishikawa cells and 0, 5, 10, and 20 mM
  for RL95-2 cells), and the cell proliferation ability was detected using CCK-8 assays.
  (a and b) Cell proliferation inhibition of Ishikawa cells was dependent on the dose
  and time of metformin exposure. (c and d) Metformin mediated RL95-2 cell growth
  inhibition in a dose- and time-dependent manner. (e) Compared with the control group
  (g), 10 mM (h) and 20 mM (i) metformin treatment resulted in cell cycle arrest at
  the G1 phase in Ishikawa cells. (f) 8 mM (k) metformin was capable of arresting
  the cell cycle at the G2 phase in PL95-2 cells in comparison with the nontreated
  group (j). Each experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated at least three
  times independently. Data are presented as the mean ± SD. ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01;
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001 versus controls. Met, metformin; Con, control.
