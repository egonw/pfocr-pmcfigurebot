caption: Cell signalling. a)Diagrammatic representation of signal reception, transduction,
  and response, exemplified by ERBB receptor tyrosine kinases and MAPK signalling.
  Ligand binding triggers receptor dimerisation at the plasma membrane, leading to
  their cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation and the recruitment of signalling complexes
  (not shown). ERBB activation then facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP in small
  GTPases (e.g. RAS proteins), inducing the recruitment of effector kinases. Here,
  we depict one of the several pathways that amplify and relay the initiating signal
  to the nucleus, the MAPK pathway (RAF→MEK→ERK). In the nucleus, ERK phosphorylates
  ELK leading to transcription of target genes, biological response, and termination
  of the originating signal.b)Diagrammatic representation of ERBB ligand reception.
  ERBB1 (also known as EGFR) binds the epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming
  growth factor alpha (TGFA), amphiregulin (AREG), heparin-binding EGF-like growth
  factor (HBEGF), betacellulin (BTC), epigen (EPGN) and epiregulin (EREG). ERBB2 has
  no ligand but can heterodimerise with other ERBB receptors. ERBB3 has very low kinase
  activity on its own but forms active dimers upon binding to neuregulins (NRG1/2).
  ERBB4 binds to several ligands of ERBB1/3, and NRG3/4.c)Once a molecular event (ligand
  binding) is transduced to a biochemical signal (RTK phosphorylation), a network
  of networks (here we depict MAPK, PI3K, and hippo pathways) further process the
  biochemical signal in space and time to trigger the most appropriate biological
  response.d)Signalling dynamics favour the activation of specific transcriptional
  programs depending on the stability of target transcripts and proteins. For example,
  ELK induce the transcription of FOS that is rapidly degraded. However, if ERK activation
  is sustained, ERK phosphorylate also FOS, leading to proliferation through Cyclin
  D1 (CCDN1) expression [].
