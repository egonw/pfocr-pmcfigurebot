caption: 'Schematic representation of the reported anticancer mechanisms of AA; key
  signaling pathways targeted by AA in cancer: Src/FAK/ERK signaling pathway inhibition
  -> inhibition of angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and migration; PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway inhibition -> inhibition of angiogenesis, cell survival, and proliferation;
  inhibition of MEK/ERK pathway -> inhibits cell proliferation and differentiation;
  inhibition of TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway -> inhibition of cell survival; inhibition
  of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway -> inhibition of cell proliferation and migration.
