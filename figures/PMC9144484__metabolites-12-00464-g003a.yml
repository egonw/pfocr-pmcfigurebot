caption: KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of genes encoding (A,C) AFP14–20-like motif-containing
  proteins and (B,D) GIP-9-like motif-containing proteins. Rankings by both number
  of genes (A,B) and fold enrichment value (C,D) are shown. Bar plot representation
  with an aspect ratio of 1.5 and −log10 (FDR) heat maps for each category are shown.
