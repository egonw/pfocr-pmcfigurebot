caption: Enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes involved in resveratrol
  action in alcohol‐burdened retinal organoids at Day 44. (A, B) The top 25 differentially
  expressed genes in RSV + EtOH1 vs. EtOH1 (A) and RSV + EtOH2 vs. EtOH2 (B). Dark
  blue and dark red in the colour scale correspond to the most downregulated genes
  and the most upregulated genes, respectively. (C, D) The bubble diagrams illustrated
  the top 10 enriched Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes pathways for the differentially
  expressed genes in RSV + EtOH1 vs. EtOH1 (C) and RSV + EtOH2 vs. EtOH2 (D). The
  bubble size corresponds to the number of enriched genes and the colour scale corresponds
  to the adjusted P‐value. (E, F) The network diagrams demonstrate the relationship
  between five representative pathways and the related top differentially expressed
  genes in RSV + EtOH1 vs. EtOH1 (E) and RSV + EtOH2 vs. EtOH2 (F). Dot size signifies
  the number of involved genes. Red dot indicates the gene enriched to the PI3K‐AKT
  pathway. (G, H) The enrichment plot of GSEA results for the differentially expressed
  genes in RSV + EtOH1 vs EtOH1 (G) and RSV + EtOH2 vs. EtOH2 (H). The vertical bar
  denotes individual differentially expressed genes hit in the pathway. The red star
  highlights the PI3K‐AKT signalling pathway. EtOH, ethanol; RSV, resveratrol.
