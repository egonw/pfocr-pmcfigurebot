caption: Copper functions as a positive allosteric regulator of the PI3K/AKT signaling
  cascade and of the autophagic proteins Unc-51-like kinase 1 and 2 (ULK1 and ULK2).
  Upon engagement of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) by growth factors (GFs), phosphoinositide
  3-kinases (PI3K) phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate
  phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), recruiting the Ser and Thr kinase
  AKT. The production of PIP3 by PI3Ks recruits the copper-dependent PDK1, which in
  turn phosphorylates AKT on its Thr308. The phosphorylation of AKT at the Ser129
  residue proceeds through the copper-dependent casein kinase 2 (CK2). Overall, the
  activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway confers to cancer cells a more aggressive behavior.
  Furthermore, the binding of copper is required for the kinase activity of ULK1/2,
  leading to the formation of a functional protein complex, together with mATG13,
  FIP200 and ATG101 to regulate the initiation of autophagy.
