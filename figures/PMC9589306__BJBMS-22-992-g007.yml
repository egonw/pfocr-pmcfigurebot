caption: 'Effect of PLCE1 on cell cycle, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. (A-D)
  Flow cytometry analysis and apoptosis assays showed that silencing PLCE1 can prevent
  the cell cycle and inhibit cell apoptosis. (E and F) Migration assays showed that
  silencing PLCE1 inhibits the migration ability of the MG63 cell line. (G and H)
  Invasion assays showed that silencing PLCE1 inhibits the invasion ability of MG63
  cell line (* or ** means compared with blank group, # or ## means compared with
  si-NC group. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, #p<0.05, and ##p<0.01).'
article_title: PLCE1 is a poor prognostic marker and may promote immune escape from
  osteosarcoma by the CD70-CD27 signaling pathway.
