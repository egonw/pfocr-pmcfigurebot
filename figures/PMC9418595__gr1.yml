caption: In silico analysis predicted anlotinib as a potential anti-leukemic therapeutic
  choice. (A) & (B) Clustered heatmap and volcano plots were generated by the normalized
  and annotated significant differential expressed genes (corrected P<0.05 and |log
  fold change (FC)|>1). (C) GO analysis of DEGs whose expression was altered in relapsed
  B-ALL cases. (D) Potential upstream regulatory kinase and downstream enriched pathway
  network was constructed by DEGs. (E) TKI-Kinase-Pathway network was constructed
  and shown. (F) & (G) Potential upstream kinase and potential downstream pathways
  were suggested by the overlapped section.

  and positive B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia via perturbation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR
