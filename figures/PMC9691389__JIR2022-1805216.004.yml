caption: Enrichment biological function of regulated alternative splicing events in
  PBMCs between DCC and LC. (a) The number of significant regulated alternative splicing
  events, including events of skipped exon (SE), retained intron (RI), mutually exclusive
  exons (MXE), 5′ splice site (A5SS), and 3′ splice site (A3SS) events. (b) GO functional
  enrichment of different RASEs. (c) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis results.
