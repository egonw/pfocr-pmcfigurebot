caption: Endocannabinoid signaling bidirectionally regulates dyskinetic attacks in
  PNKD mice. A–E, PNKD mice were pretreated with the endocannabinoid antagonist AM251
  or vehicle before caffeine injection (25 mg/kg). A, Experimental timeline. B, Dyskinesia
  score in PNKD mice during these trials. C, Left, Schematic of recording configuration.
  Right, Postmortem histology showing expression of ChR2-eYFP. D, E, Average Z-scored
  firing rates of all MSNs (D) and optically identified iMSNs (E) from PNKD mice treated
  with caffeine, with or without AM251 pretreatment. F, G, Dyskinesia scores in PNKD
  mice pretreated with the MAGL inhibitor JZL184 or vehicle before caffeine injection
  at 2 mg/kg (F) or 10 mg/kg (G). Data are mean ± SEM.
