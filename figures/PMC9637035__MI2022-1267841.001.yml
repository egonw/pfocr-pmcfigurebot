caption: 'Cell viability and cytokine production in 16-HBE cells treated with different
  doses of PQQ. (a) 16-HBE cell viability was reduced after administration of PQQ
  in a dose-dependent manner. Cell viability was measured by CCK-8 assay after 24 h
  and 48 h of incubation with PQQ. (b) Cytokine production by 16-HBE cells after 2 h
  of pretreatment with PQQ and subsequent incubation with HDMs. The columns and error
  bars represent the means and SEMs (n = 3 per group). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01; ns:
  not statistically significant. Similar results were obtained in three independent
  experiments.'
