caption: M2 macrophage-derived exosomes inhibit cell apoptosis by regulating the AKT/ERK1/2/STAT3
  signaling pathway. Western blot analysis was used to evaluate the protein levels
  of AKT, p-AKT, ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2, STAT3 and p-STAT3. (A) Representative protein expression
  plots and (B) quantified phosphorylated target protein data are presented. In comparison
  with those in the control group, the levels of p-AKT, p-ERK1/2 and p-STAT3 proteins
  in the gefitinib group were significantly decreased. The levels of p-AKT, p-ERK1/2
  and p-STAT3 in the combination group were higher than those in the gefitinib group.
  *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 and ****P<0.0001. ns, no significant difference; p-,
  phosphorylated; Exo, exosome. Data are displayed as the mean Â± SD.

  in non-small cell lung cancer by regulating the AKT, ERK1/2 and STAT3 signaling
