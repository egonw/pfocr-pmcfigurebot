caption: 'CPP increased the protein levels of CD31 and CDH5 in HDFs in vivo. (a) and
  (e): After two weeks of continuous intraperitoneal injection of mice with different
  concentrations (1 mg/kg/day, 10 mg/kg/day) of CPP and PBS, paraffin sections from
  mouse dorsal skin were performed, and immunofluorescence was conducted to detect
  the co-localization of CD31 and Vimentin or CDH5 and Vimentin. White arrows indicate
  cells expressing both Vimentin and HEY1. Scale bars: 100μm. (b–d) and (f–h): ImageJ
  analysis the co-localization of different proteins.'
