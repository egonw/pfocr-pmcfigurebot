caption: Scheme showing that extracellular (endocrine and paracrine) angiotensin (Ang)
  II is taken up via Ang II type 1a receptor (AT1aR)-mediated internalization and
  then results in Gq/11/phospholipase C (PLC) signaling. Under physiologic conditions
  (low Ang II), internalized Ang II is sorted to the lysosomal pathway for degradation,
  whereas AT1a receptors recycle back to the membrane. Alternatively, particular at
  sustained high extracellular Ang II levels, the Ang II–AT1aR complex may bypass
  the lysosomal degradation pathway, allowing its transport to mitochondria and nucleus,
  where Ang II activates AT1aR and/or Ang II type 2 receptor (AT2R) to alter mitochondrial
  oxidative and glycolysis stress responses. This may in turn alter the expression
  or activity of Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3) on the apical membranes, or Na+/K+-ATPase
  and the Na+/HCO3− cotransporter on the basolateral membranes in the proximal tubules.
  Thus, activation of the mitochondrial Ang II/AT1aR/O2−signaling will stimulate proximal
  tubule sodium reabsorption, impair the pressure-natriuresis response, and elevate
  blood pressure. Conversely, activation of the mitochondrial Ang II/AT2R/NO/cGMP
  signaling by overexpressing AT2R in the mitochondria will likely inhibit proximal
  tubule sodium reabsorption, augment the pressure-natriuresis response, and lower
  blood pressure. Modified from , ).
