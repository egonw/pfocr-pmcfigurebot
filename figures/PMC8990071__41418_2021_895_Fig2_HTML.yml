figure_title: Difference in apoptosis protein levels between cancer, immune and stroma
  cells
caption: A Graphical illustration of the modeled BCL2 pathway (DR_MOMP) upstream of
  MOMP and the modeled caspase pathway (APOPTO-CELL) downstream of MOMP B with four
  examples of the pre-batch-corrected protein staining, cell type classification,
  and calculated batch-corrected cell protein concentrations. Protein analysis of
  apoptosis proteins relevant for C the DR_MOMP model upstream of MOMP and D the APOPTO-CELL
  model downstream of MOMP in 373 cores. To determine the difference between protein
  quantification based on cell masks and quantification using the whole image, we
  first determined the median protein concentration of each core, stratified for cancer
  (red), immune (blue), and stroma (gray) cells (ANOVA, Tukey post-hoc). x marks panels
  with cropped high value outliers.
