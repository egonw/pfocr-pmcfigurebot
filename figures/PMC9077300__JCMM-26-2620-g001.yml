caption: LncRNA FOXD2‐AS1 elevation induced GSC stemness and inhibited GSC differentiation
  via activation of the NOTCH signalling pathway via TAF‐1 recruitment. GSCs were
  transfected with oe‐NC, oe‐lncRNA FOXD2‐AS1 or oe‐lncRNA FOXD2‐AS1 + sh‐TAF‐1. A,
  Western blot analysis of expression of NOTCH pathway related genes (JAG1, PS1 and
  HES1). B, The number of main spheres every 1000 GSCs and sphere at the second passage
  every 100 GSCs. C, OCT4, SOX2, Nanog, Nestin and CD133 expression detected using
  RT‐qPCR. D, CD133+ cells in U251 GSCs assessed by flow cytometry. E, U251 GSC proliferation
  measured by colony formation in soft agar. F, U251 GSC apoptosis evaluated by flow
  cytometry. G, GFAP and CD133 expression in GSCs assessed by immunofluorescence staining.
  * p < 0.05. Measurement data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation and analysed
  by one‐way ANOVA, followed by a Tukey multiple comparisons post‐test. Cell experiments
  were repeated in triplicate.
