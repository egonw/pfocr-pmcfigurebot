figure_title: Energy metabolism is reprogrammed in aging skin
caption: (A and H) Schematic illustration of tissue collection from human or mice.
  (B and I) PCA of genes in young and old skin tissues. (C and J) Circular heatmap
  displaying differentially expressed genes related to glycolysis, TCA cycle, OXPHOS,
  fatty acid metabolism, cellular senescence, inflammation, and autophagy. (D and
  K) GSEA was conducted to contrast the gene sets associated with glycolysis, TCA
  cycle, and OXPHOS between young and old skin tissues. (F and L) Differentially expressed
  enzymes involved in TCA cycle. (G and M) Pathway analysis for the effect of aging
  on skin tissues related to differentially abundant metabolite-related reactions
  using MetaboAnalyst. (E and N) Heatmap represented differentially detected metabolites
  in young and old groups associated with glycolysis, TCA cycle, and fatty acid metabolism.
  (A) to (G) represented the analysis based on tissues collected from human, and (H)
  to (N) represented that from mice. (O) Schematic of energy metabolism disorder in
  aging. n = 5 was analyzed and shown here. GABA, Î³-aminobutyric acid.
