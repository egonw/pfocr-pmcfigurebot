figure_title: RacGAP1 activated AP-1 via miR-192 and p-JNK
caption: A Microarray analysis of Hela cell RacGAP1 KD compared with NC. B KEGG pathway
  enrichment analyses of DEGs from our cohort and GSE108422. C Detection of RhoA activity
  and ROCK1 expression in RacGAP1 knockdown or -overexpressing CC cells. RacGAP1 was
  positively correlated with RhoA and ROCK1 (R = 0.49 and R = 0.68, p < 2.2e-16).
  D Changes in the expression of the genes after RacGAP1 knockdown or overexpressed
  in CC cells were detected by Western blot. E KEGG pathway enrichment analyses of
  miR-192 target genes and DEGs from GSE69990. F Western blot analysis was used to
  detect the protein expression after cells were transfected with miR-192 inhibitor
  and mimics. G Western blot analysis of the protein expression of the rescue experiment
  in CC cells. H Western blot analysis of the protein expression changes of CC cells
  treated with SP600125. I Pattern diagram of RacGAP1 effect to cervical cancer. RacGAP1
  Rac GTPase-activating protein 1, JNK c-Jun N-terminal kinase, MMP7 matrix metallopeptidase
  7, ROCK1 Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1. The data were presented
  as means ± SEM. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.005, ****p < 0.001.
