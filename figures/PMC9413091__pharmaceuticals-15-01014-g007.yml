caption: 'Galangin exerts a neuroprotective effect in 6-OHDA-treated BZ555 worms.
  (A) Representative images of BZ555 worms treated with galangin (100 μM) or L-Dopa
  (2 mM) in the presence or absence of 6-OHDA (50 mM) for 72 h. The GFP represents
  the viability of DA neurons. Magnification: Scale bars: 20 µm. (B) The bar chart
  indicates the quantification of GFP intensity in BZ555 worms. Bars, S.D., *** p
  ≤ 0.001. (C) The bar chart indicates the relative slowing rate (%) of BZ555 worms
  treated with galangin (100 μM) or L-Dopa (2 mM) in the presence or absence of 6-OHDA
  (50 mM) for 72 h. Bars, S.D., *** p ≤ 0.001. (D) BZ555 worms were treated with galangin
  (100 μM) or NAC (5 mM) for 72 h in the presence or absence of 6-OHDA (50 mM), which
  was followed by incubation with DHE solution (100 µM) for 1 h. Representative images
  of worms were captured by a fluorescence microscope. Magnification: Scale bars:
  20 µm. (E) The bar chart indicates the relative RFP. Bars, S.D., *** p ≤0.001.'
