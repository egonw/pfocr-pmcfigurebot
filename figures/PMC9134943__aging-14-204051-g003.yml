caption: GO enrichment analysis between the si-ILF3 group and si-nc group in gastric
  cancer cell SGC-7901. GO enrichment analysis revealed the functions of ILF3 in gastric
  cancer cells, including BPs (biological processes), CCs (cellular components), and
  MFs (molecular function), which showed that ILF3 played important roles in the development
  of gastric cancer.
