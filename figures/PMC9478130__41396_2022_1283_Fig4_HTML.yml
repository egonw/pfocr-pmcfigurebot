figure_title: Metagenomic functional diversity in skeletal compartments of G. edwardsi
  and P. lutea
caption: Ordination plots based on the composition of KEGG orthologs (KOs) involved
  in A overall metabolism, B carbon metabolism, and C nitrogen metabolism. D Shannon
  diversity of metabolism KOs. Significant differences between species and skeletal
  compartments are denoted by letters above the boxes. E Volcano plots depicting differentially
  abundant KEGG orthologs (KO) involved in metabolism between G. edwardsi and P. lutea.
  Each dot represents a KO and differentially abundant KOs are colored by metabolic
  processes. KOs that are not differentially abundant between species are colored
  in black. Dashed red lines represent thresholds for FDR-adjusted p value <  0.05
  and effect sizes (1 and −1) represented by the Beta statistic obtained from ANCOM-BC.
  F Differentially abundant carbon metabolism KEGG L3 pathways between G. edwardsi
  and P. lutea. Clr-transformed pathway counts were plotted and z-normalized by KEGG
  L3 pathways (rows). Left bars indicate the effect size represented by the W ANCOM-BC
  statistic and colors represent the coral species in which the process was enriched.
  Colored boxes represent the affiliation to KEGG L2 pathways.
