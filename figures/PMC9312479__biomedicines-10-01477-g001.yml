caption: The diagram shows the AMPK–SIRT signaling pathways related to OA pathogenesis
  and the potential treatment options for OA targeting at mitochondrial pathways.
  The outer circle is the cell membrane, and the inner circle is the mitochondrial
  outer membrane. The red, green, yellow, and orange blocks represent the regulatory
  molecules and the purple blocks represent the final metabolic responses in the AMPK–SIRT
  signaling pathways. The light-red blocks represent potential treatment drugs. The
  blue arrow means activation, and the red arrow means inhibition in the signaling
  pathways. The activation of AMPK–SIRT1/SIRT3–PCG–1α/FoxO3A, AMPK–SIRT3–OGG1, AMPK–PINK1/Parkin,
  and AMPK-ULK1/mTOR could reduce oxidative stress, promote mitochondrial biogenesis,
  reduce apoptosis, enhance autophagy/mitophagy, and inhibit inflammatory responses.
  In addition, the targeting metabolic pathways of potential treatment options—DADS,
  Taurine, Quercetin, Melatonin, LRWXG, CS, Rg1, DHM, Puerarin, Zinc, 17β-E2, Trelagliptin,
  Etomidate, SY, EGCG, Resveratrol, Procyanidins, Butein, and Mangiferin—are shown
  above. The green arrows indicate the metabolic effects of these potential treatment
  drugs.
