figure_title: Depletion of TgRPI results in severe growth defects in vitro and in
  vivo
caption: (A), Diagram showing strategy to construct the conditional knockout strain
  TgRPI-cKD. (B), Diagnostic PCRs on a representative TgRPI-cKD clone. PCR1 and PCR2
  checked the integration of homology templates at the 5’ and 3’ end of TgRPI, whereas
  PCR3 confirmed the deletion of endogenous TgRPI locus. (C), Immunofluorescence staining
  for TgALD and YFP expression in TgRPI-cKD parasites treated with rapamycin for 24
  h. (D), Western blotting for analyzing the expression of TgRPI in TgRPI-cKD parasites
  treated with or without rapamycin for 4 days. (E), Competition assay comparing the
  growth of TgRPI-cKD parasites treated with rapamycin for 24 h to that of untreated
  parasites. (F-G), Deletion of TgRPI showed severe lytic cycle defects by plaque
  assay and quantification of plaque sizes. Means ± SD of more than 60 plaques for
  each strain was graphed. (H), Intracellular replication assay comparing parasite
  growth in vitro. TgRPI-cKD parasites were treated with rapamycin for 4 days, and
  then they were allowed to infect fresh HFF cells for 24 h, subsequently, the number
  of parasites in each PV was checked by IFA. Results are means ± SEM for n = 3 independent
  experiments. (I), Invasion assay where freshly egressed parasites were used to invade
  HFF monolayers for 20 min. Efficiencies of invasion, as determined by two-color
  staining to distinguish invaded vs non-invaded tachyzoites (means ± SEM, n = 3 assays),
  ***, P<0.001; Student’s t-test. (J), Parasite loads in the peritoneal fluids of
  ICR mice. ICR mice were infected with TgRPI-cKD and Δrpi tachyzoites (104 tachyzoites/mouse)
  by intraperitoneal injection (n = 5 for each group), and parasite loads in peritoneal
  fluids 5 days post-infection were estimated by qPCR. (K), Virulence tests of indicated
  strains in ICR mice (100 parasites per mouse, n = 10 mice for TgRPI-cKD strain,
  n = 20 mice for Δrpi mutants), ***, P<0.001; Gehan–Breslow–Wilcoxon tests.
