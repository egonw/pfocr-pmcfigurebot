caption: Temporo-spatial distribution of metabolites of the alanine, aspartate, and
  glutamate metabolism pathway. (A) Spatial distribution and changes of metabolites
  involved in the alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism pathway in the treatment
  (50 min after dosing) and control groups. (B) MS images of metabolites of the alanine,
  aspartate, and glutamate metabolism pathways in brain tissue section acquired using
  AFADESI-MSI. Statistical analysis of the metabolome data extracted from control
  and treatment groups (50 min) in different brain microregions. (means ± SD), n = 3.
  ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 and ∗∗∗P < 0.001. The red circle in the pie chart represents
  the conversion of log2 (1) equal to 0 when the fold change of metabolite before
  and after administration is 1 (FC = 1). The sector outside the red circle represents
  the fold change greater than 1 (FC > 1) and indicates this metabolite with up-regulation
  after drug intervention in this microregion, while the sector inside the red circle
  represents the fold change less than 1 (FC < 1) and indicates this metabolite with
  down-regulation after drug intervention in this microregion. The distance of the
  radius of the sector from the red circle represents the degree of fold change. Outside
  the red circle, a larger radius of the sector represents more pronounced up-regulation,
  and within the red circle, a smaller radius of the sector represents more significant
  down-regulation. The size of the rounding angle represents the relative abundance
  in the microregion; the larger the rounding angle, the greater the relative abundance.
