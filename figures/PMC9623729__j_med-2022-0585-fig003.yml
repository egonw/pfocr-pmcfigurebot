caption: 'Potential downstream signal pathways of ASAP3 are revealed through GSEA
  analysis. Based on GSEA data results, Rig like receptor signaling pathway (a), Inositol
  phosphate metabolism (b), and NOTCH signaling pathway (c) were enriched in the high
  ASAP3 expression group. Ribosome (d), oxidative phosphorylation (e), and Parkinson''s
  disease (f) were enriched in the low ASAP3 expression group. The scores for each
  gene''s enrichment are displayed in the top panels. The lower panels display the
  ranking metrics for each gene. X-axis: rankings for all genes; Y-axis: values of
  ranking metrics. NES stands for normalized enrichment score.'
