caption: miR-708-5p targets SSRP1 to inhibit osteogenesis of BMSCs by regulating Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling. (a) Venn diagram of the predicted target genes of miR-708-5p. (b) Relative
  luciferase activity of HEK293T with pmirGLO-SSRP1 WT or pmirGLO-SSRP1-MUT (Promega)
  24 h post-transfection with agomiR-nc or agomiR-708-5p (GenePharma, Shanghai, China).
  (c) Western blot analysis of siSSRP1 knockdown efficiency in BMSCs after transfection
  with PBS, siRNA-nc, or siSSRP1-1, siSSRP1-2. (d) Western blot analysis of the protein
  expression levels of Col1, Runx2, ALP, and osteocalcin in BMSCs transfected with
  PBS, siRNA-nc, or siSSRP1-1. (e) PCR analysis of the Wnt signaling pathway factor
  BMP4, AXIN2, Wnt11, and LEF1 mRNA expression in BMSCs after transfection with siRNA-nc
  or siSSRP1-1. (f) PCR analysis of SSRP1 mRNA expression after transfection with
  PBS, agomiR-nc, or agomiR-708-5p. (g) Western blot analysis of the protein expression
  levels of SSRP1 in BMSCs transfected with PBS, agomiR-nc, or agomiR-708-5p. (h)
  Western blot analysis of the protein expression levels of SSRP1 and β-catenin in
  BMSCs after transfection with PBS, siRNA-nc, siSSRP1, or siSSRP1 + antagomiR-708-5p.
  (i,j) ALP staining of BMSCs transfected with PBS, siRNA-nc, siSSRP1, or siSSRP1
  + antagomiR-708-5p and analysis of ALP activity with ImageJ. (k,l) ARS staining
  of BMSCs transfected with PBS, siRNA-nc, siSSRP1, or siSSRP1 + antagomiR-708-5p
  and calculation of the area of mineralization with ImageJ. Data are presented as
  means ± SD from three independent experiments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001,
  and ****p < 0.0001.
