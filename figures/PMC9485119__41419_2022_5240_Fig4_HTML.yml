figure_title: WEE2-AS1 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and directly interacts
  with MOB1A
caption: 'A, B Subcellular fractionation assays and RNA-FISH confirm that WEE2-AS1
  is predominantly located in the cytoplasm (scale bar: 20μm). C Level of WEE2-AS1
  detected by qRT-PCR after RIP for Ago2 in HCT 116 and HT-29 cells. D The top five
  miRNAs are predicted from LncBase Experimental v.2. E The luciferase reporter plasmid
  (RLuc-WEE2-AS1) was cotransfected into HEK-293T cells with the 5 various miRNA-coding
  plasmids. F Silver staining of WEE2-AS1 pulldown. Blue boxes show different bands
  between the WEE2-AS1 and NC probe. G List of the top 10 differentially expressed
  proteins identified by mass spectrometry. The amino acid sequence of a doubly charged
  peptide was identified as NH2-ELAPLQELIEK-COOH, and a Mascot search showing the
  peptide matched with MOB1A. H Level of WEE2-AS1 detected by qRT-PCR after RIP for
  MOB1A in HCT 116 and HT-29 cells. I Dual RNA-FISH and immunofluorescence assays:
  WEE2-AS1(red), MOB1A(green) (scale bar: 10 μm). J, K. qRT-PCR and western blot for
  MOB1A expression. Data are shown as mean ± SD of three independent experiments,
  ***P < 0.001, ns. not significant.'

  via promoting degradation of MOB1A to inhibit the Hippo pathway.
