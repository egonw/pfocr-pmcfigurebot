caption: 'Hallmark gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). “HALLMARK E2F TARGETS”, “HALLMARK
  G2M CHECKPOINT”, “HALLMARK MTORC1 SIGNALING”, “HALLMARK MYC TARGETS”, and the “HALLMARK
  P53 PATHWAY” enriched in the high CDK1 expression group compared to the low CDK1
  expression group in various tumors. Each line represents one particular gene set
  with a unique color, with upregulated genes located on the left and the ones with
  the highest expression on the far left, while downregulated genes are shown on the
  right. NES: normalized enrichment score; FDR: false discovery rate.'
