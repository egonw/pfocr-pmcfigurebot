caption: 'The FGF10‐dependent response to UVB‐induced skin injury requires YAP activity.
  (A) Immunofluorescence staining of Ki‐67 (Red) in untreated or UVB treated HaCat
  with or without FGF10 treatment in the presence or absence of si‐YAP. Nuclei were
  stained with DAPI (blue) (n = 3). Scale bars = 100 μm. (B) Quantification the percentage
  of Ki‐67‐positive cells from (A). (C) The expression of YAP and PCNA was measured
  by immunoblotting assay in untreated or UVB treated HaCaT with FGF10 or without
  FGF10 treatment in the presence or absence of si‐YAP. β‐Actin was used as a loading
  control (n = 3). (D,E) Quantification of YAP, PCNA protein levels in (C). (F) Representative
  HE staining of AAV‐GFP or AAV‐Fgf10 transfected skin treated with or without UVB
  in the presence or absence of VP (n = 3). Scale bars = 100 μm. (H) Quantification
  the epidermal thickness from (F). (G) Immunohistochemical staining of PCNA in the
  AAV‐GFP or AAV‐Fgf10 transfected skin treated with or without UVB in the presence
  or absence of VP. The positive staining (brown) demonstrated positive expression
  (n = 3). Scale bars = 100 μm. (I) Quantification the epidermal thickness from (G).
  The data are presented as the means ± SEM. ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05,
  ###P < 0.001, ##P < 0.01, &&P < 0.01, &P < 0.05 vs. the corresponding control siRNA
