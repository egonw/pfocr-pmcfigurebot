figure_title: Scrutinizing putative RRM2 upstream regulators by CasID
caption: '(A) GSEA of transcriptome data generated following combined 3AP-prexasertib
  treatment of IMR-32 and CLB-GA neuroblastoma cells shows significantly reduced expression
  of E2F and G2-M cell cycle–controlled genes compared to control (DMSO)– or single
  compound–treated cells. (B) GSEA of transcriptome data generated following combined
  3AP-prexasertib treatment of IMR-32 and CLB-GA neuroblastoma cells shows significantly
  up-regulated expression of p53 target genes compared to control (DMSO)– or single
  compound–treated cells. (C) RT-qPCR confirms significantly up-regulated HEXIM1 expression
  upon combined 3AP and prexasertib treatment compared to control treatment (DMSO).
  (D) Left: Volcano plot of significantly enriched hits from a proximity-based and
  biotin-dependent CasID approach for the identification of RRM2 upstream regulatory
  factors in SK-N-BE(2)-C cells (FDR < 0.05). Right: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)
  for the identification of enriched pathways and putative upstream regulators of
  the putative RRM2 regulators as identified by CasID (overview of all hits can be
  found in table S1). (E) Boxplots depicting the activity score in IMR-32 and CLB-GA
  cells of a prexasertib “sensitivity” (left) and “resistance” (right) gene signature
  as defined in neuroblastoma patient-derived xenografts (PDX) (). (F) Boxplots depicting
  the activity score in IMR-32 and CLB-GA cells of an adrenergic gene signature ().
  (G) Boxplots depicting the activity score in IMR-32 and CLB-GA cells of a mesenchymal
  gene signature (). (H) Boxplots depicting the activity score in IMR-32 and CLB-GA
  cells of an ALK signaling signature (). (I) Heatmaps depicting the significantly
  differentially expressed genes of the ALK signaling signature as scored in (H).'
