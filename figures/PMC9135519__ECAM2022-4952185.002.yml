caption: CBX7 overexpression inhibited the malignant progression of LUAD and LUSC
  cells. (a) The viability of A549 and SK-MES-1 cells was detected by CCK-8 assay.
  (b) The apoptosis of A549 and SK-MES-1 cells was detected by flow cytometry. (c)
  The migration of A549 and SK-MES-1 cells was measured by transwell assay. Scale
  bar = 50 µm. (d) The invasion of A549 and SK-MES-1 cells was measured by transwell
  assay. Scale bar = 50 µm. A549 and SK-MES-1 cells were transfected with lenti-NC
  or lenti-CBX7. ∗∗p < 0.01 and ∗∗∗p < 0.001 vs. lenti-NC.
