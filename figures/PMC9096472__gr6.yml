caption: Effects of trametinib treatment on expression of the cytoplasmic DNA-sensing
  pathway-related genes in A2780-R cells(A and B) The gene expression profiles of
  viral defense response were obtained from A2780-R treated with mock control or 2 μM
  trametinib for 24 h. (B) Relative TPM value of cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway-related
  genes among the virus defense genes. (C) A schematic diagram of cellular signaling
  for trametinib-treated A2780-R cells. See also . ∗p < 0.05.
