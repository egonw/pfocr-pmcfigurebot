figure_title: Pathway Analysis of TRb-responsive genes
caption: A) Pathway enrichment analysis was performed for each cluster from the heatmap
  in  (shown on the bottom C1-C4). Shown are the top enriched A) KEGG pathways and
  B) Hallmark pathways for each cluster. In each plot, the color represents the significance
  (false discovery rate (FDR)) and the size signifies the gene set size.
