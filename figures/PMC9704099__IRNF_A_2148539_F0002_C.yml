caption: 'Expression of PPARγ and apoptosis-related factors Bcl-2 and Bax in renal
  tissues. (A) qRT-PCR analysis of mRNA expression of PPARγ, Bcl-2 and Bax in each
  group of kidney tissues. (B, C) Western blot analysis of PPARγ protein expression
  in renal tissue. (D-F) Western blot analysis of protein expression of apoptosis-related
  factors Bcl-2 and Bax. (G) The ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax (Bcl-2/Bax) in renal tissue,
  as determined by Western blot analysis. Data are expressed as mean ± SD, n = 6/group.
  ***p < .001 compared with the control group; ##p < .01, ###p < .001 compared with
  the hypoxia injury group. C: Control group; H: Hypoxia injury group; P: PPARγ agonist
