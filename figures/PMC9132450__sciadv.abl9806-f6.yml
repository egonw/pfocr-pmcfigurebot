figure_title: Loss of function of RND1/3 and ARHGAP5/35 compromises SEMA3-induced
  growth inhibition of cancer cells
caption: (A) Knockdown of RND1/3 and ARHGAP5/35 compromised SEMA3 inhibition of NCI-H1792
  cells. Duplex RNAi oligos were used to knock down the target genes. The cells were
  treated with SEMA3 3 days after transfection of RNAi. Two-tailed Student’s t test
  was performed. **P < 0.01. (B) RND1 G70R, a cancer-associated mutation, is unable
  to induce YAP phosphorylation. RND1 plasmids (250 or 500 ng) were transfected into
  cells growing on six-well plates. (C) Cancer-associated mutants of RND and ARHGAP35
  are defective in mediating YAP regulation by SEMA3A. Various mutants of RND1/3 and
  ARHGAP35 were expressed in RND1/3 KO cells and ARHGAP35 dKO cells, respectively.
  Cells were then treated with SEMA3 recombinant proteins. (D) Cancer-associated mutants
  of RND and ARHGAP35 are defective in mediating cell growth regulation by SEMA3A.
  Cell growth after 2-day SEMA3A-conditioned medium treatment was analyzed. Two-tailed
  Student’s t test was performed. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01.
