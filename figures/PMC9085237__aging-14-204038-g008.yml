caption: 'Effects of pLXSN and WT-TP53 on clonogenicity in the presence of 5-Fluorouracil,
  gemcitabine or cisplatin in two PDAC cell lines. The clonogenicity in the presence
  of increasing concentrations of 5-fluorouracil (5FU), gemcitabine (Gem) and cisplatin
  (Cis) were examined in: MIA-PaCa-2 + pLXSN and MIA-PaCa-2 + WT-TP53 (A–C), PANC-28
  + pLXSN, and PANC-28 + WT-TP53 (D–F). Red horizontal bars = MIA-PaCa-2 or PANC-28
  containing pLXSN. Blue horizontal bars = MIA-PaCa-2 or PANC-28 containing WT-TP53.
  These experiments were repeated and similar results were observed. The colonies
  for each cell line were normalized to untreated so that the results from pLXSN and
  WT-TP53 could be compared. ***P < 0.0001, **P < 0.005 and *P < 0.05.'
article_title: Wild type and gain of function mutant TP53 can regulate the sensitivity
  of pancreatic cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, EGFR/Ras/Raf/MEK, and PI3K/mTORC1/GSK-3
  pathway inhibitors, nutraceuticals and alter metabolic properties.
