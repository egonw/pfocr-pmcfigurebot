caption: (A) The natural cellular response to inflammatory cytokines, like IL-1. IL-1
  binds to the IL-1 receptor, which activates the NF-κB pathway that turns on the
  transcription of potent inflammatory cytokines that are responsible for activating
  inflammatory responses (red background). (B) Engineered cells with a synthetic promoter
  containing five NF-κB recognition sequences upstream of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist
  (IL-1Ra) was integrated into the genome of iPS cells (dotted line in DNA). In these
  engineered cells, when IL-1 proteins bind to their receptors, rather than inflammatory
  cytokines being produced, these cells produce IL-1Ra, a protein that blocks the
  IL-1 receptors from binding to the IL-1 protein and therefore prevents inflammatory
  cytokines from being produced (green background). (C) These engineered cells can
  be implanted into the knee of an animal experiencing inflammation (red background)
  to aide in the immune response by sensing and responding to inflammatory stimuli
  and producing anti-inflammatory proteins in an autoregulatory fashion (green background).
