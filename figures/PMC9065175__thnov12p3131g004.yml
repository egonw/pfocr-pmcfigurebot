caption: Olig2 overexpression altered the expression of genes and metabolites involved
  in the PPARγ-mediated phospholipogenesis pathway. A Volcano plots of significantly
  differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Transcriptome analysis of Olig2-OPCs and
  control-OPCs (n = 6), red, upregulated; green, downregulated. B Gene set enrichment
  analysis (GSEA) indicated strong enrichment of the PPAR signaling pathway in Olig2-OPCs.
  C Heatmap evaluation of the expression of genes linked to lipid metabolism. D The
  mRNA expression levels of PPARG, PPARA, and PPARD in Olig2-OPCs and control-OPCs
  (ns p > 0.05, ** p < 0.01, by a two-tailed Student's t test). E PCA score plots
  of HILICESI+-MS metabolomics profiles obtained from HILIC-ESI+-MS, control-OPCs,
  n = 5; Olig2-OPCs, n = 6. F Metabonomic analysis showed that several species of
  intermediates and hydrolysates of phospholipid biosynthesis were increased in Olig2-OPCs
  (n = 5/6, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, by a two-tailed Student's t test).
  G Metabolite set enrichment analysis (MSEA) showed differential metabolites highly
  enriched in phospholipid biosynthesis in Olig2-OPCs. H The mRNA expression levels
  of CEPT1 and CHPT1 in Olig2-OPCs and control-OPCs (** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, by
  a two-tailed Student's t test). The graphs represent the individual data points
  and the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments.
