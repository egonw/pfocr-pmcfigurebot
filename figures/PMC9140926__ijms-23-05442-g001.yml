caption: Cytotoxicity effect of PUG on RAW 264.7 cells. Pretreatment with or without
  LPS (1 μg/mL) on cells for 1 h at 37 °C. Then, cells were treated with PUG (0, 2,
  4, 6, 8, and 10 μM) for 24 h at 37 °C. (A) Cytotoxicity effect of PUG on non-LPS-induced
  RAW264.7 cells. (B) Cytotoxicity effect of PUG on LPS-induced cell viability in
  RAW264.7 cells. The data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean
  (SEM). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
