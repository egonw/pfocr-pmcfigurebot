figure_title: TRF leads to common and tissue-specific changes in molecular pathways
caption: (A) Tissue by tissue overlap of differentially expressed (DE) genes in each
  tissue. (B) Number of DE genes per tissue (bar) and their cumulative contribution
  to the total percent of DE genes (line). (C) Distribution of the DE genes ranked
  according to the number of tissues in which they are upregulated (top) or downregulated
  (bottom) in TRF. (D) Heatmap of common Metascape annotated pathways for DE genes
  upregulated (top) or downregulated (bottom) by TRF that are enriched in ≥ 5 tissues.
  Pathways enriched by overrepresentation analysis (ORA) (P<0.05) are shown. Pathways
  not enriched are represented in black. (E) Network analysis of Metascape annotated
  pathways for DE genes upregulated (blue) or downregulated (red) in TRF in ≥ 5 tissues.
  Each circle represents a distinct pathway annotation. The ratio of red or blue color
  in a circle indicates the number of enriched genes in that pathway annotation. Purple
  connections indicate common genes between various pathway annotations. The thickness
  of the purple connection represents the number of common genes. Pathways significantly
  enriched by ORA (P<0.05) are shown. See also , ,  and .
