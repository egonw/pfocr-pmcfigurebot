caption: OGG1 inducibly binds to HBP regulatory elements and recruits phospho-Pol
  II. XChIP was performed on control or RSV-infected hSAECs; data are expressed as
  a fold change over IgG control. (A) OGG1 binding to the GFPT2 intragenic enhancer.
  (B) OGG1 binding to the UAP1 promoter. (C–F), Cells were RSV infected in the presence
  of solvent (DMSO) or TH5487 as indicated. (C,D), XChIP for RELA binding. (E,F),
  XChIP for phospho-Ser2 CTD Pol II binding. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; n.s., not
  significant. Each symbol is an independent immunoprecipitation.
