caption: 'Representative images of immunohistochemical staining in BC tissues. Panel
  A displays representative images of biomarker expression. On the left: (A) Positive
  NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) expression, (B) negative NLRP3 expression, (C)
  Positive Apoptosis-Associated Speck-Like Protein Containing a Pyrin and CARD domain
  (PYCARD) expression, (D) Negative PYCARD expression; On the right: (E) Positive
  CyclinD1 expression, (F) negative CyclinD1 expression, (G) Positive MYC expression,
  (H) Negative MYC expression. Panel B displays representative images of FISH experiments:
  (on the left) CCND1 gene amplification; (on the right) MYC gene amplification. For
  immunohistochemistry: original magnification, ×400. Scale bar = 20 μm.'
