caption: Summary graph of animal and human models for metabolic pathways potentially
  involved in aging processes. Graph was generated by the metabolite set enrichment
  analysis (MSEA) using the MetaboAnalyst program (www.metaboanalyst.ca; accessed
  on 18 September 2022) (“pathway analysis” option) by projecting metabolites onto
  metabolic pathways. The list of all metabolites associated with aging, which are
  presented in the papers mentioned in this review, was used for projection. Names
  of metabolic pathways with statistically significant (p < 0.01) enrichment with
  projected metabolites are shown. The p value evaluates whether a measured set of
  metabolites is represented in the pathway more than expected by chance within a
  given list of metabolites (p values from the pathway enrichment analysis). Metabolic
  pathways of Homo sapiens (KEGG) were used to project metabolites. Pathway impact
  values are from the pathway topology analysis.
