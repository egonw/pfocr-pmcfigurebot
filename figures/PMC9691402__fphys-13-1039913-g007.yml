caption: 'ERα regulates phenotypic switching of VSMCs and cerebrovascular remodeling
  in simulated microgravity rats. (A) Flowchart of the experimental processes and
  scheme of animal model establishment. (B,C) Representative images showing H&E staining
  (B) and immunohistochemical staining of α-SMA, OPN and PCNA (C) of rat basilar arteries
  under HU or control. (D) Western blot analysis of Fis1, p-Drp1 S616, Drp1, Parkin,
  Pink1, Mfn1/2, ERα, Nrf1, and OMI protein in rat cerebral VSMCs under HU or control.
  PPT was used as ERα agonist and 3 MA was used as mitophagy inhibitor. *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 vs. control, ###p < 0.001 vs. HU, ΔΔΔp < 0.001 vs. HU
  + PPT.'
