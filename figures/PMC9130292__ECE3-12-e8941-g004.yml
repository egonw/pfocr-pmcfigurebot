caption: Simplified biosynthetic pathway of the Heliothis subflexa sex pheromone,
  redrawn from Groot, Estock, et al. () and based on Jurenka (). Desaturation and
  β‐oxidation produce mono‐unsaturated acyl‐CoA precursors from 18 or 16 carbon acyl
  CoA derivatives, which are then modified to form acetates, alcohols, and aldehydes
  through specific enzymatic conversions. The ∆9 and ∆11 desaturases create a double
  bond between the 9th and 10th or 11th and 12th carbon of the 18‐ or 16‐carbon acyl‐CoA
  derivatives, respectively. β‐oxidation shortens the chain length from 18 to 16 carbons.
  Note that (Z)9–16 acyl‐CoA can be formed through two alternative routes. The compounds
  present in the pheromone glands of H. subflexa are in boxes that are color coded
  depending on their function in male response behavior
