caption: 'The PKC-α pathway mediates IL-17-induced promotion of VCAM-1 synthesis and
  monocyte adhesion in OASFs. (A,D,H) OASFs were stimulated with PKC inhibitors (GF109203X,
  10 nM and Gö6976, 10 nM) for 30 min or transfected with a PKC-α siRNA for 24 h and
  then treated with or without IL-17 (10 ng/mL) for 24 h. Quantification of VCAM-1
  expression was performed by qPCR and Western blot. (B,C,E,F) Adherent THP-1 cells
  were photographed and quantified under fluorescence microscopy. (G) PKC-α protein
  levels were measured by Western blot. (I) OASFs were stimulated with IL-17 for the
  indicated time intervals. PKC-α phosphorylation was performed by Western blot. Size
  bar = 320 μm. * p < 0.05 compared with the control group; # p < 0.05 compared with
  the IL-17-stimulated group.'
