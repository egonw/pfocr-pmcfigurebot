caption: 'RANKL lowers LPS response in macrophages. (a and b) IL-1β and TNF-α expression
  in THP1 macrophages stimulated with LPS (10 ng/ml) and RANKL (10 ng/ml) or costimulated
  with both (LPS+RANKL) for 24 h, detected by qPCR, and compared to the nonstimulated
  control group (CT). (c and d) IL-1β and TNF-α protein level in supernatant of THP1
  macrophages stimulated with LPS (10 ng/ml) and RANKL (10 ng/ml) or costimulated
  with both (LPS+RANKL) for 24 h and detected by ELISA. (e) Representative images
  of macrophages immunostained to detect iNOS (magenta), F4/80 (green), and nuclei
  (DAPI, blue) by immunofluorescence in THP1 macrophages stimulated with LPS (10 ng/ml)
  and RANKL (10 ng/ml) or costimulated with both (LPS+RANKL) for 24 h. (f) Quantification
  of iNOS positive cells in LPS and RANKL stimulated THP1 macrophages. The quantification
  was based on the threshold in 6 fields of each sample by ImageJ software (n = 4).
  (g) Quantification of relative iNOS mRNA expression in THP1 macrophages stimulated
  with LPS and RANKL or costimulated with both (LPS+RANKL) for 24 h, detected by qPCR,
  and compared to the nonstimulated control group (CT). (h) Quantification of NF-κB
  activation in THP1 macrophages transfected with a plasmid expressing NF-κB-driven
  luciferase stimulated with LPS (10 ng/ml) and RANKL (10 ng/ml) or costimulated with
  both (LPS+RANKL) for 24 h and detected by luciferase activity presented as relative
  units (RU). A one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni''s multiple comparisons test
  was performed to compare all groups (∗p < 0.01 vs. CT and #p < 0.01 vs. LPS). The
  data represent the mean of three independent experiments and are presented as means
  ± SD.'
