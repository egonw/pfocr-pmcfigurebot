caption: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection results in a massive
  inflammatory response. (a) Number of significantly up/downregulated genes identified
  by comparing with respective uninfected control represented in a table. (b, c) Gene
  ontology fold enrichment for infection and inflammatory response. Heat map color,
  white to red. (d−f) Real‐time PCR validation of selected genes (d) Inflammation—TNF‐α,
  IL‐6, IL‐13 (e) Apoptosis—BCL2, CDK1, FOS (f) Tissue repair—TGFβ1, VEGF (g) Heat
  map of genes from key signaling pathway involved in inflammation—IFNγ, NF‐κΒ; heat
  map color, red to green through black. NF‐kB, nuclear factor kappa B; TGF, tumor
  growth factor; NF, tumor necrosis factor; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor
