caption: Mdivi‐1 alleviates mitochondrial dysregulation and apoptosis in vivo and
  in vitro. (A) Immunofluorescence staining images of mitochondrial morphology in
  Sirt6‐siRNA‐transfected podocytes treated with 20 μM Mdivi‐1 or vehicle (dimethyl
  sulfoxide [DMSO]) for 24 h. Scale bar = 3 μm. (B and C) Average length and aspect
  ratio of podocyte mitochondria in each group. (D) Electron microscopy ultrastructural
  image of podocyte mitochondria from the kidneys of the mice in the groups injected
  with Mdivi‐1 or vehicle (DMSO) every other day after Ang II administration. Scale
  bar = 1 μm. (E and F) Average length and aspect ratio of podocyte mitochondria from
  normal and Ang II‐infused mice at 4 weeks. *p < 0.05, n = 5
article_title: Sirt6 deficiency contributes to mitochondrial fission and oxidative
  damage in podocytes via ROCK1‐Drp1 signalling pathway.
