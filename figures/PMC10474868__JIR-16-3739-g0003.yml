caption: 'Analysis of active transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-β1) levels in culture
  medium by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay after cultivating cells on carbon nanofilms
  for 24 h. There were significant differences in TGF-β1 secreted by control and nanofilm-treated
  THLE-3 cells ((Aa), p = 0.011), HepG2 cells ((Ab), p < 0.001), C3A cells ((Ac),
  p < 0.001), and SNU-449 cells (Ad, p = 0.011). Differences with a p-value ≤ 0.05
  were defined as statistically significant compared to the control group: one asterisk
  (*), p-value ≤ 0.05; two asterisks (**), p-value ≤  0.01; three asterisks (***),
  p-value ≤  0.001.'
