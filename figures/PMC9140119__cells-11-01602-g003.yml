caption: The effects of knocking down MEK, ERK, KSR2, and P38 on female C. bowringi
  ovarian development. (A) Representative ovarian samples after dsRNA treatments.
  (B) Ovary sizes as a result of key gene silencing (n = 11–13). (C) Ovarian development
  grades after treatment with second non-overlapping dsRNA fragments of key genes
  (n = 18–32). (D) Vg1 and Vg2 expression levels were detected in the fat bodies.
  All data were collected at 4 days PE and presented as mean ± SD, with a significance
  test performed between the control and treatments using an independent t-test, *
  p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.
