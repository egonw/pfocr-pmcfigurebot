caption: D. dao inhibits MAPK signaling pathway. (a) The western blot bands of p-ERK1/2,
  ERK1/2, p-MEK, MEK, p-p38, and JNK. (b) The relative protein expression of p-ERK/ERK.
  (c) The relative protein expression of p-MEK/MEK. (d) The relative protein expression
  of p-p38. (e) The relative protein expression of p-JNK/JNK. Data were expressed
  as mean ± SD (n = 3). Significance was determined by ANOVA followed by Dunnett's
  test. ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. the IG group.
