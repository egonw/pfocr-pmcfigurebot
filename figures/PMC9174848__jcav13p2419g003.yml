caption: (A) Relative mRNA expression levels of t glycolysis related proteins s after
  FUZ knockdown and overexpression by qRT-PCR. (B) Relative expression levels of glycolysis
  related proteins after FUZ knockdown and overexpression using western blot analysis.
  (C) Cellular 18F‚ÄêFDG uptake was significantly decreased after FUZ siRNA transfection
  and increased upon FUZ overexpression. (D) Lactate levels in the culture medium
  of FUZ siRNA-transfected A549 and H1299 cells were significantly decreased, whereas
  they were increased upon FUZ overexpression. si-FUZ is FUZ siRNA, si-NC is siRNA
  negative control, pcDNA-FUZ is overexpressed FUZ, and NC is negative control. Measurements
  were taken from three independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P <
  0.001.
