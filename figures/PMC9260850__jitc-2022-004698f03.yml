caption: Correlations of lung intratumor bacterial burden with tumor cells’ function.
  (A) Correlation of host genes with bacterial burden in tumor cells (Spearman’s rank
  correlation, R=0.7 cut-off shown in dotted red line). (B) Correlation between host
  CTNNB1 expression and bacterial burden in tumor cells (Spearman’s rank correlation,
  95% CI shown in gray). (C) Representative images of immunohistochemistry staining
  of β-catenin in tumor regions with known low or high bacterial burden. (D) Ingenuity
  pathway analysis of genes correlated with bacterial burden in tumor cells.
article_title: Spatial meta-transcriptomics reveal associations of intratumor bacteria
  burden with lung cancer cells showing a distinct oncogenic signature.
