caption: Several cell signalling pathways were analysed after resveratrol treatment.
  (A and B) Levels of AKT/mTOR and p38 MAPK/ERK pathway proteins, as determined by
  Western blot analysis. (C) mRNA expression of β‐catenin and Wnt3a determined by
  qRT‐PCR. (D) Distribution of β‐catenin (red) in resveratrol‐treated SGC7901 cells
  as determined by immunofluorescence. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue).
  (E) Levels of nuclear β‐catenin, as evaluated by Western blot analysis. Reported
  values are mean ± SEM. **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 indicate significant differences
  compared with the control group
