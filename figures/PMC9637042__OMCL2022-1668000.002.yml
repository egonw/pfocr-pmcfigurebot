caption: 'The levels of AIF-1, miR-34a, ATG4B, autophagy, and inflammation in kidney
  of db/db mice. (a) The expression of AIF-1 in db/db mice was evaluated by immunohistochemical
  staining. (b) The expression of AIF-1, ATG4B, LC3II, p62, and NLRP3 protein in db/db
  mice was detected by western blot. Versus db/m mice group, ∗P < 0.01. (c) The expression
  of miR-34a in db/db mice was detected by qPCR. Versus db/db mice group, ∗P < 0.001.
  AIF-1: allograft inflammatory factor-1; miR-34a: microRNA 34a; ATG4B: autophagy
  related 4 homolog B; LC3II and p62: autophagy-associated protein; NLRP3: NOD-like
  receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3.'

  Stress, and Autophagy via miR-34a/ATG4B Pathway in Diabetic Kidney Disease.
