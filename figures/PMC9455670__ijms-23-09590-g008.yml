caption: The compound m-3M3FBS fails to block B-Raf signaling. (A) Signaling pathway
  connecting TRPM8 and TRPM3 stimulation with AP-1-induced gene transcription. The
  activation point of the fusion protein ∆B-Raf:ER is indicated. (B) Signaling pathway
  connecting TRPM8 and TRPM3 stimulation with AP-1-induced gene transcription. The
  activation point of the fusion protein ∆B-Raf:ER is indicated. (C) HEK293-∆B-Raf:ER
  cells were infected with a recombinant lentivirus containing Coll.luc reporter gene.
  The cells were incubated in medium containing 0.05% serum for 24 h. Stimulation
  was performed with 4OHT (100 nM) for 24 h. Cells were harvested and analyzed as
  described in the legend to  (n = 3; n.s., not significant).
