figure_title: PARP inhibitors function in the same pathway as TIMELESS and TIPIN to
  prevent a TRC-induced DNA damage response
caption: 'a, Outline of the experiment. b, Quantification of the percentage of cells
  with γH2AX and 53BP1 foci following depletion of TIMELESS or TIPIN or treatment
  with PARP inhibitors and/or combinations thereof; γΗ2ΑΧ and 53BP1-positive cells:
  >20 foci; bars indicate means ± 1 s.d.; n = 3 replicates; >207 cells per group (range:
  207–403). Olap, olaparib (10 μM); Tal, talazoparib (100 nM). CTRL, control; TIM,
  TIMELESS; TIP, TIPIN. c-d, Substitutions targeting the TIMELESS-PARP1 interface
  compromise the function of these proteins in averting TRC-dependent DNA damage responses.
  c, Levels of endogenous and ectopically-expressed PARP1 proteins in cells transfected
  with siRNAs (CTRL or PARP1b) and plasmids (PARP1WT or PARP1D993G). A representative
  immunoblot is shown; PCNA served as loading control. siPARP1b, siRNA targeting the
  endogenous PARP1 gene, but not the PARP1 genes expressed by the plasmids; PARP1WT,
  wild-type PARP1; PARP1D993G, D993G single amino acid substitution mutant. d, Quantification
  of the percentage of cells with 53BP1 or γΗ2ΑΧ foci; bars indicate means ± 1 s.d.;
  n = 3 replicates; for 53BP1 foci >246 (range: 246–657), for γΗ2ΑΧ foci >251 (range:
  251–624) cells per group; ANOVA.'
