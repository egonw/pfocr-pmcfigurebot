figure_title: KIR2DL5 ITIM and ITSM mediated NK cell inhibition and suppressed downstream
  signaling
caption: '(A) Tyrosine (Y) in ITIM and ITSM of KIR2DL5 was mutated to phenylalanine
  (F). The KIR2DL5– primary NK cells were transduced with WT KIR2DL5 or the indicated
  mutants, and then examined for protein expression with F8B30 (open) or mIgG1 (shaded).
  NC, negative control. Data are representative of 2 independent experiments. (B and
  C) Transduced primary NK cells were treated with (+) or without (–) pervanadate
  (VO4) for 5 minutes. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-KIR2DL5 antibodies.
  Phospho-tyrosine (4G10), SHP-1, SHP-2, and total KIR2DL5 were detected by immunoblots
  (B). Quantification of p-Tyr, SHP-1, and SHP-2 association with WT or mutant KIR2DL5
  in VO4-treated NK cells (C). WCL, whole-cell lysates. (D) Representative imaging
  of cell conjugates acquired upon the indicated transduced primary NK and PVR/Raji
  cell contact followed by staining with anti-KIR2DL5 mAb and DAPI. Scale bars: 10
  μm. (E) Lysis of scramble control or PVRKO A427 (top) and Jurkat (bottom) by WT
  or mutant KIR2DL5–transduced primary NK cells at the indicated E/T ratios. Data
  are mean for duplicate measurements and representative of 3 independent experiments
  with 3 different donors. (F and G) Expression and phosphorylation of Vav1, ERK1/2,
  p90RSK, and NF-κB in sorted KIR2DL5+ primary NK cells after cross-linking with indicated
  mAbs at indicated time points (F). Quantification of immunoblotting (G). GαM, goat
  anti–mouse IgG antibody. Data are mean ± SEM from 2 independent experiments. In
  A, B, and F, data are representative of 3 independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P
  < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001, by 1-way ANOVA (C), paired (D) or unpaired
  Student’s t test (G).'
