caption: 'Erythropoietin (EPO) treatment and animal behavioral assessment design.
  (A) Whole in vivo experiment schedule: Beta amyloid-42 oligomer (Aβ) was injected
  into the intracerebroventricular (ICV) space at D7 (7 days before EPO treatment).
  Then, recombinant human EPO (rhEPO) or saline was injected daily via the intraperitoneal
  (IP) route for 5 consecutive days from D0. The novel recognition object test (NORT)
  was performed on a weekly basis, from D7 to D28. Body weight was measured right
  before every NORT. The passive avoidance acquisition phase (shock phase) was carried
  out 5 days after rhEPO injection. Then, step-through latency trials were performed
  7, 14, 21, and 28 days after the shock phase to monitor the duration of the acquired
  memory from the shock. (B) Body weight gains of the three groups during the test
  periods were not significantly different (each group n = 8 to 10). (C) Depictions
  presenting two neurobehavioral assessment methods used in this study were: NORT
  and passive avoidance test.'
