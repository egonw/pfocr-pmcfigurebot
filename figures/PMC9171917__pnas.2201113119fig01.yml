caption: 'The amanitin biosynthesis locus and biosynthetic genes in Galerina species.
  (A) Amanitin biosynthetic genes are color-coded (red, green, blue, and black). Candidate
  biosynthetic genes are marked as light blue arrowheads. The amanitin biosynthetic
  loci were aligned for three Galerina genomes. Gene number suffix: position upstream
  (-) of GmAMA1-1; the two named downstream genes are not numbered based on position.
  Lines connect the genes (dots) with the highest homology within the genomes. (B)
  Deletion of GmFMO1 in G. marginata results in termination of α-amanitin production.
  In liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis: solid line denotes
  OD295 for wild type; red dashed line denotes OD295 for GmFMO1 mutant. In the DNA
  blot analysis, the wild type and the mutant are shown, with hph for the hygromycin
  B marker. (C) Deletion of GmP450-29 in G. marginata results in termination of α-amanitin
  production. In the LC-MS analysis: solid line denotes OD295 for wild type; red dashed
  line denotes OD295 for GmP450-29 mutant. In the DNA blot analysis, the wild type
  and the mutant are shown, with hph for the hygromycin B marker.'
