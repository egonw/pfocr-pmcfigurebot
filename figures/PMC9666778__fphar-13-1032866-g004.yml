caption: BBM inhibits RANKL-induced activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. (A)
  Representative western blotting images of P65, p-P65, IκBα and p-IκBα after stimulation
  with or without 4 μM BBM for the indicated time. (B–C) Quantitative analysis of
  the p-P65/P65 ratio (B) and p-IκBα/IκBα ratio (C) at each indicated time point.
  (D) Representative confocal images of the P65 nuclear translocation assay in BMMs
  treated with or without 4 μM BBM. (E–F) Quantitative analysis of the mean P65 fluorescence
  intensity in the nucleus (E) and the percentage of P65-positive nuclei (F). (G)
  Representative western blotting images of JNK, p-JNK, ERK, p-ERK, P38 and p-P38
  after stimulation with or without 4 μM BBM for the indicated time. (H–J) Quantitative
  analysis of the p-JNK/JNK ratio (H), p-ERK/ERK ratio (I) and p-P38/P38 ratio (J)
  at each indicated time point. *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 compared to the control group.
