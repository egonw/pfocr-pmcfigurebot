caption: STRING protein interaction network. Analysis of the signaling pathway altered
  by the anti-DNM1L Ab injection. Search tool for the retrieval of interacting proteins
  (STRING) shows the signaling pathways of the most significantly changed proteins
  using the medium confidence score (0.4). The target protein of the study, DNM1L,
  was added manually to the network.
