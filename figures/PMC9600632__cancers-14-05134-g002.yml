caption: Characterization of the intracellular NF-κB pathway. (A,B) THP-1 Dual cells
  were pretreated with endocytosis inhibitors, such as chlorpromazine (CPZ) to inhibit
  clathrin-mediated endocytosis or chloroquine (CHQ), an inhibitor of endosomal maturation,
  in the presence or not of anti-TLR antibodies or of the inhibitor CLI-095 for one
  hour. Cells were subsequently stimulated with 300 nM ATP128. After 18 h, supernatant
  was recovered and either (A) SEAP activity was measured by QUANTI-Blue assay, or
  (B) Luciferase activity was measured by QUANTI-Luc assay. The values here reported
  are a mean of 3 biological replicates. Values were compared via either a one-way
  ANOVA test to the untreated control sample or unpaired t-test to the control of
  the group (CPZ or CHQ). (C,D) THP-1 Dual cells were pretreated with chlorpromazine
  (CPZ) or chloroquine (CHQ) in the presence or not of antibodies anti-TLR2/4 for
  one hour. Cells were subsequently stimulated with 300 nM ATP128 FL or ATP128 w/o
  CPP. After 18 h, supernatant was recovered and either (C) SEAP activity was measured
  by QUANTI-Blue assay, or (D) Luciferase activity was measured by QUANTI-Luc assay.
  Filled-in bars represent stimulation with ATP128 FL, while the outlines represent
  the stimulation with ATP128 w/o CPP. The values here reported are a mean of 3 biological
  replicates. Values were compared via a one-way ANOVA test to the untreated control
  sample stimulated with ATP128 FL. **** p-value < 0.0001, *** p-value < 0.001, **
  p-value < 0.01, * p-value < 0.1.
