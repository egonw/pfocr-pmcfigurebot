caption: 'TF3 diminishes cartilage destruction in OA rat model. SD rats were divided
  into five groups: Control, OA, OA + Erastin, OA + Erastin+TF3, OA + Erastin+DFO.
  (a) The representative visual inspection of cartilage damage and representative
  images is shown. The arrows point to the areas of medial femoral condyles. (b) The
  representative MRI results of rats. (c) The representative HE staining results of
  different groups. (d) The progression of OA was evaluated using the OARSI scores.
  ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01. Statistical comparisons were calculated using the Mann–Whitney
  U test.'
