caption: 'Activation of the Nrf2 signalling pathway with tBHQ attenuated HG-induced
  podocyte injury. (A) Podocytes were pretreated with tBHQ (20 μM) for 2 h and then
  treated with or without HG for 24 h. The cells were incubated with podocin antibody
  and DAPI. (B) Quantitative analysis of the relative fluorescence intensity of podocin.
  (C) Podocytes were treated as indicated above and stained with phalloidin. (D) Western
  blot analysis of Bax, Bcl-2 and cleaved caspase-3 in podocytes of different groups.
  (E–G) Quantification analysis of Bax, Bcl-2 and cleaved caspase-3 expression. (H)
  Podocytes were treated as indicated above, and flow cytometry analysis of podocyte
  apoptosis was performed in different groups. (I) Quantitative analysis of apoptotic
  cells in Figure H. (∗P < 0.05 vs. NG group, #P < 0.05 vs. tBHQ group, and △P < 0.05
  vs. HG group.) The uncropped images of (D) were referred to in supplementary Figure 4.'
