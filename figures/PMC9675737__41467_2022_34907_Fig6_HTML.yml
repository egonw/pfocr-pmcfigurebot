figure_title: Metabolic stress promotes the regulation and sensitization of glycolytic
  enzymes to sorafenib, leading to RAS-ERK1/2 pathway activation
caption: 'a Representative immunoblot showing the time-dependent regulation of PFKFB2
  phosphorylation (S483) upon GS in NRASQ61- and BRAFV600E-mutant melanoma cells (n = 3
  independent biological experiments). b Representative immunoblot showing the sensitization
  of PFKFB2 phosphorylation to sorafenib and not trametinib upon 4 h GS in BRAFV600E-
  and NRASQ61- mutant melanoma cells (n = 3 biologically independent samples). c Representative
  immunoblot showing PFKFB2 phosphorylation regulation (S483) over time in response
  to GS and sorafenib treatment in NRASQ61- and BRAFV600E-mutant melanoma cells (n = 2
  biologically independent samples). d Representative immunoblot showing PFKFB2 phosphorylation
  regulation (S483) in response to GS and RAS/ERK1/2 pathway inhibition conditions
  (Ras inhibitor: Salirasib; RAF inhibitors: sorafenib, regorafenib, and CCT196969;
  MEK inhibitors: trametinib and U0126) in NRASQ61 and BRAFV600E mutant melanoma cells
  (n = 3 biologically independent experiments). Numbers show the fold induction of
  the indicated ratio. e Representative immunoblots showing PFKFB2 phosphorylation
  regulation (S483) in response to 4 h. GS in NRAS, CRAF, BRAF and MEK1/2 SKMel103
  knockdown cells (n = 3 biologically independent experiments). Numbers show the fold
  induction of the indicated ratio. f PFK1 enzymatic activity assay in BRAFV600E-
  and NRASQ61- mutant melanoma cells after GS for 15 and 30 min (mean ± SD, n = 5
  biologically independent samples; unpaired two-sided t test, ****p < 0.0001). g
  Immunofluorescence of PFK1 (PFKM) and F-actin (Alexa Fluor-488-phalloidin) in BRAFV600E-
  and NRASQ61- mutant melanoma cells under 1 h GS Bars represent 500 µm (yellow) and
  25 µm and 5 µm (white). h Immunoblot showing the activation of the RAS-ERK1/2 pathway
  in SKMel103 cells by the addition of fructose 1,6 bisphosphate (F1,6BisP) to complete
  medium (CM), under low glucose conditions (5 mM) and GS (n = 3 biologically independent
  samples). The numbers indicate the fold change with respect to the control. i Immunoblot
  showing the activation of the RAS-ERK1/2 pathway by the addition of fructose 1,6
  bisphosphate (F1,6BisP) under GS in SOS1/2 knockdown NRASQ61-mutant melanoma cells
  (n = 3 biologically independent samples). The numbers indicate the fold change with
  respect to the control. C Control, GS glucose starvation, Sor. Sorafenib, Tra. Trametinib,
  Sal. Salirasib, Reg. Regorafenib, CCT. CCt196969, S.E. short exposure, L.E. long
  exposure.'
