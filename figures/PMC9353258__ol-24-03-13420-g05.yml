caption: Putative mechanism via which chronic restraint stress affects gastric epithelial
  transformation. A detrimental diet resulted in DNA damage and activated the protein
  expression of p53. Restraint stress may act on ADRB2 receptors by promoting catecholamine
  released from the local nerve terminals of the gut, thus inducing the activation
  of Akt, which may contribute to the ubiquitination and degradation of p53 and thereby
  reduce the effects of p53. The apoptosis of epithelial cells was finely regulated
  by p53. ADRB2, adrenoceptor Î²2; MNNG, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine; p, phosphorylated.
