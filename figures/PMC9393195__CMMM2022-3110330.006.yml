caption: 'The effect of miR-29b expression on the downstream molecules in the signaling
  pathway. (a) RT-PCR showed that the expression level of HIF-1α, Sirt1, and AKT was
  decreased when miR-29b was overexpressed, while the level of TNF-α and FOX01 was
  increased when miR-29b was overexpressed. The siFEMB1 reversed this phenomenon.
  (b) The results of WB showed that when miR-29b was overexpressed, the expression
  levels of SMAD3 and Sirt3 were decreased and the TNF-α, VEGF, and FOX01 were increased.
  And the overexpression of FEM1B augments this phenomenon. (c) The expression ability
  of downstream molecular pathway factors in the supernatant of ELISA cells. ∗P ≤
  0.05, comparison between the miR-29b group and NC-A549 group; #P ≤ 0.05, comparison
  between the si-FEM1B and NC-NCI-H1792 group.'
