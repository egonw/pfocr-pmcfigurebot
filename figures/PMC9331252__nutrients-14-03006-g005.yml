caption: 'MLE and nCGA reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels
  in OH cultured VSMCs. ROS levels in OH-treated A7r5 cells were increased and then
  notably decreased after treatment with MLE (3.0 mg/mL) and nCGA (40 and 120 μM).
  (A) ROS levels were measured by flow cytometry with a 10 μM carboxylated H2DCFDA
  analog (carboxy-H2DCFDA, C400). (B) The levels of Nrf2, SOD, and catalase in OH-treated
  A7r5 cells were notably increased under OH conditions and notably decreased after
  treatment with nCGA (40 and 120 μM). The quantitative data are presented as the
  mean ± SD from a minimum of three independent experiments. # p < 0.05 as compared
  to the C (control). * p < 0.05 as compared to the OH group.'
