caption: Cisplatin induces CLK2 upregulation via p38. (A) Western blot analysis of
  CLK2 expression in A2780 cells treated with various signaling pathway inhibitors
  or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in the presence or absence of cisplatin. Only p38 inhibitor
  attenuated the expression of CLK2. (B) CLK2 mRNA level in A2780 cells treated with
  cisplatin in the presence or absence of p38 inhibitor was measured by qRT‐PCR. Data
  was shown as mean ± SD. p Values were determined by Student's t‐test. (C) A2780
  cells treated with phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS), or cisplatin, or cisplatin plus
  p38 inhibitor (p38i), or cisplatin and p38 overexpression (p38‐Myc) were incubated
  with 20 µg/mL cycloheximide (CHX) for the indicated periods and then analyzed by
  Western blot. The results were normalized to the levels of GAPDH. (D) Quantitation
  of CLK2 protein levels was based on the Western blot result. Data were shown as
  mean ± SD. (E) Coimmunoprecipitation assay showing the presence of a complex containing
  CLK2 and p38. CLK2 antibody coprecipitating p38 (top panel). p38 antibody coprecipitating
  CLK2 (bottom panel). Input, protein expression in cell lysates detected by Western
  blot. IgG, negative control. IP, expression of compound coprecipitated by CLK2 or
  p38 antibody. n.s., no significance.
