caption: 'Targeting STK16 Inhibited Colorectal Cancer Proliferation In Vivo. A. Representative
  tumor images shown. B. Drawing tumor growth curve of the three groups (n = 5). C.
  Statistical analysis of tumor weight. D. Kaplan-Meier Plot was drawn for the three
  groups (n = 12). E, F. IHC (E) and IB (F) assays to detect the expression level
  of identified proteins. G. Representative tumor images shown. H. Drawing tumor growth
  curve of the two groups (n = 5). I. Statistical analysis of tumor weight. J. Kaplan-Meier
  Plot was drawn for the two groups (n = 13 for DMSO and n = 12 for STK16-IN-1). K,
  L. IHC (K) and IB (L) assays to detect the expression level of identified proteins.
  M. The working model: STK16 inhibits the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway degradation
  of c-MYC by phosphorylating c-MYC at S452, contributing to colorectal cancer progress'
