caption: 'KEGG pathway enrichment scatter plots of DEGs. Pathway names are on the
  left. The x-axes show enrichment factors, and larger enrichment factors indicate
  greater significance in expression levels. Q-values are indicated on the right.
  Dot size represents the number of genes, and colors represent different Q values,
  which are p-values corrected by multiple hypothesis tests. (A) KEGG pathway of DEGs
  under BCK vs. BCK + ABA. (B) KEGG pathway of DEGs under BCK vs. BCK + JA. Abbreviations:
  BCK, CK + BPH.'
