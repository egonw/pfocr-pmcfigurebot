caption: Pyroptosis increased in cell death forms after GSDME overexpression. (a and
  b) The expression level of GSDME protein was determined by WB. (c and d) The protein
  level of GSDME in cells was detected using immunofluorescence. (e and f) The IC50
  of Y79 and WERI-RB-1 cells was detected using CCK-8. (g) The death morphologies
  of the three cell lines were observed using an Olympus microscope. Y79 and WERI-RB-1
  cells were transfected with LV-GSDME; black arrows, apoptotic cells; white arrows,
  pyroptotic cells. (h–l) GSDME-N and its pathway proteins were detected by WB. (m)
  LDH in the cell supernatant was detected by ELISA. Each experiment was repeated
  at least three times. Scale bar, 100 μm.
