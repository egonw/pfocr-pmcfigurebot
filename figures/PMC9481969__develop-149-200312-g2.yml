caption: Overview of integrated expression patterns. (A) Union of the expression of
  all Wnt genes (red, i), all Fzd genes (green, ii) and the canonical pathway read-out
  reporter (purple, iii) across the three stages of development as indicated. Column
  iv shows the ‘all-Fzd’ domain overlaid on the ‘all-Wnt’ domain with overlap shown
  in yellow. Columns v and vi add the canonical read-out domain in purple (vi is an
  external view). Column vii shows individual Wnt expression patterns that contribute
  to the ventral Wnt domain (red, Wnt2; purple, Wnt10b; pink, Wnt4; pale blue, Wnt5a;
  dark red, Wnt11; dark blue, Wnt5b). (B) 3D graphs showing the extent (proportional
  size) of each Wnt gene domain in the whole embryo and in individual anatomical domains
  across stages as indicated; the y-axis shows the proportion of the anatomical domain
  (z-axis) occupied by each gene expression domain (x-axis). (C) Wnt11 and Wnt5a expression
  domains on midline sagittal sections across stages; these patterns illustrate the
  dynamic changes in extent of expression across stages.
