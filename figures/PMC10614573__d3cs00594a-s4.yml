figure_title: (A) A subset of reaction pathways that account for the majority of the
  formose observed behaviour. The Breslow's autocatalytic cycle is at the centre,
  and serves as a continuous source of small sugars (mostly two- and three-carbon
  ones), while various dominant formaldehyde chain-growth reaction pathways arise
  from the cycle components. Only key compounds, such as those constituting the Breslow
  cycle, dihydroxyacetone (3) and fructose (7), have been numbered. Adapted with permission
  from ref. . Copyright 2022 Nature Publishing Group. (B) Alternative route to biological
  sugars, analogous to that of gluconeogenesis, that could be subject to occur through
  non-enzymatic reactions. From glucose-6-phosphate, it would be possible to generated
  ribose-5-phosphate through an analogous version of the pentose phosphate pathway
  (not shown). Compounds G3P, DMAP, F1,6BP and F6P in panel B are phosphorylated versions
  of compounds 2, 3 and 7 in panel A. Adapted with permission from ref. . Copyright
