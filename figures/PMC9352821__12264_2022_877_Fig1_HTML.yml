caption: 'Activation of a dipeptidergic pathway from l/vlPAG tac1+ neurons to PVH
  oxytocin neurons. A Both ST and chemogenetic activation of PVH oxytocin neurons
  by hm3Dq lead to better social interaction and conditioned place preference. ST
  induces higher firing of l/vlPAG tac1+ neurons and PVH oxytocin neurons, which depends
  on substance P-TACR1 signaling. B l/vlPAG tac1+ neurons release glutamate and substance
  P in the PVH to activate oxytocin neurons. However, only the substance P-TACR1 signaling
  contributes to the reduction of transient K+ current. IA channels: transient, A-type,
  K+ current channels.'
