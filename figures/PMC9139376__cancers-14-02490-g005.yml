caption: Signaling pathway analysis by KEGG for downregulated miRNA target genes in
  3D organotypic cultures. Bubble plot of the KEGG enrichment analysis is shown, on
  the y-axis the enriched pathways of miRNAs downregulated in 3D organotypic cultures
  (left panel) and miRNAs overexpressed in 3D cultures (right panel) are shown. The
  size of the circle represents the number of genes involved in that pathway. The
  color represents the p-adjusted value.
