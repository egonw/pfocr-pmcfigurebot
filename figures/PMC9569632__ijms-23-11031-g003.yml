caption: Effects of PD-L1 on NSCLC migration and invasion. Overexpression of PD-L1
  enhanced the migratory and invasive ability of H2170 (a) and H1299 (b) cells. Representative
  images of the migration and invasion assays (ai,bi); magnification 50 ×); quantification
  of the number of migrated and invaded cells of H2170 (aii) and H1299 (bii). Reduced
  PD-L1 mRNA expression (c) and protein expression (d) in H157 cells after siRNA knockdown
  (KD). β-actin was used as a loading control for Western blotting (WB). (e) Knockdown
  of PD-L1 led to decreased migratory ability, revealed by migration assay. Representative
  images of the migration assay (ei, magnification 50×); quantification of the number
  of invaded cells (eii). * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001 when analyzed using Student’s
  t-test.
