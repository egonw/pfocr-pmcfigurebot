figure_title: p63 regulated pathway in cancer
caption: (a) In SCC p63 is co-amplified with ACTL6a []. Their interaction maintains
  the proliferative state of the tumor cells together with other subunits of the BAF-complex
  []. The p63-ACTL6a interaction is also important in the regulation of the Hippo-YAP
  signaling pathway in cancer [, , ]. Similarly, the amplification of SOX2 in SCC
  results in the interaction with p63 and the proliferation regulation of cancer cell,
  among other co-regulated genes []. (b) To allow the cancer cell survival p63 can
  inhibit the proliferation program through its interactors. The p63 interaction with
  HDAC PML and p73 inhibits the transcription of pro-apoptotic gene, such as BAX and
  PUMA []. The interaction of p63 with iASPP leads to apoptosis inhibition only when
  p53 is mutated []. (c) The interaction of p63 with APC complex is also mediated
  by the p53 mutation. Under this condition, the β-catenin accumulation occurs in
  the nucleus leading to the aberrant regulation of the Wnt pathway, also mediated
  by p63-TCF/LEF interaction [, ]. Moreover, the p63-p300 contributes to the β-catenin
  accumulation in the nucleus []. Lastly the p63/SMAD/mutant-p53 complex formation
  is observed in cancer and leads to the down-regulation of metastasis suppressor
  genes [].
