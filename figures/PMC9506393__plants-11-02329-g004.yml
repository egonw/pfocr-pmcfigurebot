caption: Transcriptome analysis of the genetic mechanism of DXWR in response to cold
  stress. (A) Differentially expressed gene statistics. (B,C) are Venn diagrams of
  up-regulated and down-regulated genes, respectively. (D,E) are gene ontology (GO)
  functional enrichment histogram and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG)
  pathway enrichment histogram, respectively. 0_4, 0_12, and 4_12 represent the comparison
  of DXWR seedling treatment at 4 °C for 0 h and 4 h, 0 h and 12 h, and 4 h and 12
  h, respectively. PGI, FAE, CSWB, SSM, ASNSM, GM, GPM, LAM, ALAM, NM, PB, FB, PST,
  PPER, and PPI in subfigure (E) represent pentose and glucuronate interconversions,
  fatty acid elongation, cutin suberine and wax biosynthesis, starch and sucrose metabolism,
  amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, glycerolipid metabolism, gycerophospholipid
  metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, nitrogen
  metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, plant hormone
  signal transduction, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, and plant–pathogen
  interaction, respectively.
