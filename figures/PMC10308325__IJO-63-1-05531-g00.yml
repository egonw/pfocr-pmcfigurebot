caption: miR-133b suppresses TGF-β-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and
  invasion of breast cancer cells. (A) Western blot analysis for the expression of
  TGFβR1, p-SMAD3, SMAD3, Snail and N-cadherin in MCF-7 cells transfected with miR-NC
  or miR-133b mimics in the absence or presence of TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) for 24 h. (B)
  Expression of TGFβR1, p-SMAD3, SMAD3, Snail and N-cadherin in MDA-MB-231 cells transfected
  with miR-NC or miR-133b mimics in the absence or presence of TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) for
  24 h. β-actin was used as an internal control. Transwell assays for MCF-7 cells
  transfected with miR-NC or miR-133b mimics in the absence or presence of TGF-β1
  (5 ng/ml) for 24 h (migration) or 36 h (invasion). (C) Migrating and (D) invading
  cells were stained and counted in at least three light microscopic fields. Scale
  bar, 100 µm. Transwell assays for MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with miR-NC or miR-133b
  mimics in the absence or presence of TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) for 24 h (migration) or 36
  h (invasion). (E) Migrating and (F) invading cells were stained and counted in at
  least three light microscopic fields. Scale bar, 100 µm. **P<0.01. miR, microRNA;
  NC, negative control; TGFβR1, transforming growth factor β receptor I.

  epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and metastasis by suppressing the TGF-β/SMAD
  pathway in breast cancer.'
