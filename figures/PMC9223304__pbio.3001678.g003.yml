figure_title: The polyol pathway can mediate sugar-induced transcriptional alteration
  of Mondo/Mlx-target genes
caption: (A–D) Wild-type and Sodh mutant third instar larvae were starved for 18 hours,
  followed by refeeding for 6 hours with a 10% solution of indicated sugars. A comparison
  of expression changes of the Mondo/Mlx-target genes between glucose-fed and sorbitol-fed
  wild-type larvae (A), sorbitol-fed wild-type and Sodh mutant larvae (B), glucose-fed
  wild-type and sorbitol-fed Sodh mutant larvae (C), glucose-fed wild-type and fructose-fed
  Sodh mutant larvae (D). (E) The expression changes of metabolic genes. Genotype
  of larvae and fed sugars are indicated above. Known Mondo/Mlx-target genes are indicated
  in red (activated genes) or green (suppressed genes). (F) A comparison of expression
  changes of the Mondo/Mlx-target genes between glucose-fed wild-type and Sodh mutant
  larvae; 30 larvae per batch, n = 3 batches. Correlation coefficients (r) are indicated
  in the plots (A–D and F). (G) Effects of different sugars on CCHa2 expression in
  Sodh mutant larvae. (H) CCHa2 mRNA levels in the third instar larvae of polyol pathway
  mutants raised on a normal diet containing 10% glucose; 10 larvae per batch, n =
  3 batches. Bar graphs show mean ± SE. n.s. P > 0.05; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001.
  The data underlying the graphs can be found in  and –. AR, aldose reductase; Sodh,
  sorbitol dehydrogenase.
