caption: Module analysis. (A) Module 1 comprises 18 genes and is enriched in cardiac
  muscle contraction and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. (B) Module 2 comprises 12 genes
  and is enriched in ECMâ€“receptor interaction, protein digestion and absorption, and
  the PI3k-Akt signaling pathway. (C) Module 3 comprises 7 genes and is enriched in
  muscle organ development and skeletal muscle contraction.
