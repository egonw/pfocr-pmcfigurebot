caption: RNA-seq and Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (GSEA) of early canine invasive
  urothelial carcinoma (InvUC) demonstrating shared and subtype-specific pathways
  of importance in human bladder cancer. In the heatmap (A), each column represents
  data from one “early” sample, and the samples are grouped according to luminal or
  basal molecular subtype (see key), with expected heterogeneity observed within and
  between samples. Differentially expressed genes (n=2785, FC ≥2, pcorr ≤ 0.05) were
  identified that were unique to early InvUC as compared to normal bladder mucosa
  from dogs with no urinary disease. Enriched gene sets (Hallmark collection) in early
  basal and early luminal InvUC were identified with GSEA and depicted with Normalized
  Enrichment Score (NES) (B-D). In addition to shared gene sets between the molecular
  subtypes, such as TGFβ, TP53, PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling, and apoptosis pathway (B),
  marked differences between the subtypes were readily apparent (A, C, D). Inflammatory
  Response, Allograft Rejection, and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition gene sets were
  enriched in early basal tumors (C), and Notch signaling, UV-Response Pathway, and
  Apical Surface gene sets were enriched in early luminal tumors (D). Additional genes
  and pathways identified in Ingenuity Pathway Analyses are summarized in .
