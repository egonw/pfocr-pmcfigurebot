caption: 'The proteins encoded by ZBH-01 group-specific DEmRNAs were prominently involved
  in cell cycle regulation A. The PPI network. The yellow part highlights the most
  prominent module. B Enlargement of the yellow module in (A), containing 73 genes.
  C Most significantly enriched KEGG pathway of these 73 genes. D qRT-PCR result showed
  the relative expression of some DEmRNAs in (B) in LS174T cells after treatment with
  50 nmol/l ZBH-01, CPT-11, and SN38 24 h (logarithmic transformation). Green: downregulated;
  Red: upregulated. E, The result of western blot showed that ZBH-01 is more efficient
  than CPT-11 and SN38 in regulating the expression of three representative cell cycle
  related genes, MYBL2, CCNA2, and CDK2'
article_title: A novel camptothecin derivative, ZBH-01, exhibits superior antitumor
  efficacy than irinotecan by regulating the cell cycle.
