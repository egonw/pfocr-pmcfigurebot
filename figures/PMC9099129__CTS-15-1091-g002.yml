caption: Donor (a) and recipient (b) NK cell activity in liver transplantation tolerance
  and rejection. In theory, targeted inhibition of the PD‐1 pathway in donor NK cells
  could enhance the killing of alloreactive recipient immune cells and limit rejection
  (a). However, inhibiting immune checkpoints in recipient NK cells and other immune
  cell populations could augment the anti‐graft response (b)
