caption: Experimental design of the induction of DSS colitis and drug treatment. (After
  one week of acclimatization, the mice were randomly divided into the control group,
  DSS group, 5-ASA group, and Jat groups. Except for the control group, other groups
  were given 3% DSS in sterile water to establish UC animal model. 5-ASA group and
  the Jat L, M, and H groups were administered orally once a day for 10 days at the
  same time as modeling. 7 days later, the water containing 3% DSS was replaced with
  sterile water, and each administration group continued to be administered for 3
  days, and the mice were euthanized on the last day of the experiment).
