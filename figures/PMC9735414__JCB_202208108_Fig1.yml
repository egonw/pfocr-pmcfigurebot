caption: The genomic background of patients and the Kif4-mutant mice exhibit a high
  embryonic mortality rate and developmental delay. (A) The pedigree chart of a Kif4
  mutation-carrying family. Note that III-1, IV-1, and IV-2 (Kif4aWT/Mut) exhibited
  no symptoms, whereas IV-3 (Kif4aMut/Y) showed global developmental delay, severe
  intellectual disability, and intractable seizure. (B) Illustration of the mouse
  KIF4 protein with its point mutation identified from the patients. LCR, low complexity
  region; CC, coiled coil; CXC, tesmin/TSO1-like CXC domain. (C) Coiled–coil prediction
  of the mouse KIF4 peptide from amino acid 524–732. Note that the Mut-KIF4 has a
  higher coil probability, as indicated with the asterisks. (D) Mouse mating strategy
  and the mortality rate. The embryonic mortality rate of Kif4 mutation-carrying mice
  (Mut, 26%) is significantly higher than that of wild-type mice (WT, 7%) Data are
  presented as mean ± SEM (n = 12 mating mouse pairs). ***P < 0.001 (Student’s t tests).
  (E) The composition of the offspring genotypes from the Kif4-mutant background exhibited
  a lower Kif4Mut/Y pup population (n = 6 mating mouse pairs). (F) The photograph
  of Kif4WT/Y and Kif4Mut/Y mice at E16.5 and the statistical analysis results of
  embryo size. Data are presented as mean ± SEM (n = 8 mouse pairs). ****P < 0.0001
  (Student’s t tests). (G) The postnatal weight comparison between Kif4WT/Y and Kif4Mut/Y
  mice from P3 to P14. Data are presented as mean ± SEM (n = 12 mouse pairs). *P <
  0.05, **P < 0.01 (two-way ANOVA). (H) The assessment of Kif4WT/Y and Kif4Mut/Y mouse
  developmental milestones. Note that Surface Righting, Auditory, Open field, and
  Air Righting exhibited statistical significance. Data are presented as mean ± SEM
  (n = 12 mouse pairs). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 (two-way ANOVA). (I) HE
  staining of sagittal mouse brain sections from the indicated genotypes at E16.5
  and the corresponding statistical analysis of the hippocampal cell density. The
  red stars in the left panels indicate the hippocampus regions that are magnified
  in the right panels. Scale bars, 1000 μm (left panel) and 100 μm (right panel).
  Data are presented as mean ± SEM (n = 12 hippocampi from 6 mouse pairs). ****P <
  0.0001 (Student’s t tests).
