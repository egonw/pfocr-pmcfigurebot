caption: (A) Q-PCR analysis results showed that CHIR-99021 or XAV-939 activated or
  inhibited β-catenin expression in both groups, indicating that the canonical Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway is regulated by CHIR-99021 and XAV-939. (B) Q-PCR analysis and
  Western Blot. CHIR-99021 enhanced the RUNX-2 gene expression in the normal group
  while CHIR-99021 inhibited the expression in the AED group. The RUNX-2 expression
  was higher under the stimulation of XAV-939 in the AED Group. Western Blot results
  suggested that CHIR-99021 upregulated the RUNX-2 protein expression in the normal
  group. XAV-939 increased the RUNX-2 protein expression in the AED group. Non-adjusted
  images of Western Blot were provided in Supplementary material (See in Supplement1
  and Supplement2). Data are means ± SEM. * means p < 0.05, ** means p < 0.01, ***
  means p < 0.001.
