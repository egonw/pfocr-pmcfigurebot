figure_title: Figure 6. Differentially expressed genes related to carbohydrate metabolism
  between the freshly harvested seeds and stratified seeds. (A) Differentially expressed
  genes related to starch and sucrose pathway. The diagram was manually drawn according
  to the KEGG pathway map (map00500, starch and sucrose metabolism, https://www.genome.jp/pathway/map00500).
  (B) Heatmap represent the gene expression levels (RPKM values) in the freshly harvested
  seeds and stratified seeds. The relative expression levels of seven differentially
  expressed genes related to starch and sucrose metabolism were calibrated against
  those of the Actin gene (C) and GAPDH gene (D) quantified by qRT-PCR, respectively.
  ** indicates significant differences between the freshly harvested seeds and stratified
  seeds at the 1% level
