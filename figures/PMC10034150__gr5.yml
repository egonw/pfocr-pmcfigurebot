caption: Functional enrichment analysis of mRNAs in ceRNA network. Cluster analysis
  of the differentially-expressed miRNAs (A) and mRNAs (B) in the GSE126093 and GSE126092
  datasets with P-value < 0.05 and |LogFC| > 1. The top 30 most significantly enriched
  biological processes (C), cell components (D), and molecular functions (E) after
  GO analysis of differentially-expressed mRNAs in the ceRNA network with P-value
  < 0.05. (F) KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were performed using target genes in
  the ceRNA network. Enrichment was analyzed with P-value < 0.05. The color intensity
  of the nodes shows the degree of enrichment. The dot size represents the count of
  mRNAs in a pathway.
