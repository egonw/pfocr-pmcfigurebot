caption: 'The mechanism of mitophagy. Mitophagy is induced by ROS, hypoxia, ischemia,
  and other stimuli. There are two distinct signaling pathways for mitophagy, which
  are as follows: (1) The PINK1â€“Parkin pathway of mitophagy. Following stress, PINK1
  accumulates on the outer membrane of the mitochondria (OMM), promoting Parkin recruitment
  to ubiquitinate several OMM components. Poly-Ub chains are subsequently recognized
  by adaptor proteins (p62, OPTN, and NDP52) and further initiate autophagosome formations
  through binding with LC3. (2) The mitophagy receptor-mediated pathway. The BNIP3,
  NIX, FUNDC1, BCL2L13, and FKBP8 mitophagy receptors localize to the OMM and directly
  bind with LC3 to mediate mitochondrial elimination. Abbreviations: PINK1, PTEN-induced
  putative kinase 1; Parkin, Parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase; ub, ubiquitination;
  p62/SQSTM1, sequestosome 1; OPTN, optineurin; NDP52/CALCOCO2, calcium binding and
  coiled-coil domain 2; LC3, microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3; BNIP3,
  BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa-interacting protein 3; NIX, NIP3-like protein X; FUNDC1,
  FUN14 domain-containing 1; BCL2L13, B-cell lymphoma-2-like 13; FKBP8, FK506-binding
  protein 8.'
