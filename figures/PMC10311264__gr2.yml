caption: FMDV 3Cpro suppressed ISGs mRNA synthesis and GAS promoter activity of type
  II IFN signaling. A HeLa cells transfected with pXJ41, pXJ41-GST, pXJ41-3ABC, pXJ41-3A,
  pXJ41-3B or pXJ41-3C were treated with 100 ​ng/mL of human IFN-γ at 24 ​h after
  transfection. 5 h later, the ISGs transcript levels were measured by real-time RT-PCR,
  with pXJ41 and pXJ41-GST as negative controls. The levels of relative transcript
  were shown as relative fold changes, compared with the mock-treated control level
  of uninfected cells. Data represent the mean ​± ​the standard deviations (error
  bars) of three independent experiments. B Expression of 3ABC, 3A, 3B or 3C protein
  was detected by Western blotting using antibody against FLAG or antibody against
  HA. β-actin was used as a protein loading control. C HeLa cells grown in 12-well
  plates were cotransfected with 0 ​μg, 0.125 ​μg, 0.25 ​μg or 0.5 ​μg of pXJ41, pXJ41-GST,
  pXJ41-3ABC, pXJ41-3A, pXJ41-3B or pXJ41-3C and 0.5 ​μg of pGAS-Luc as well as 0.05 ​μg
  of pRL-TK as an internal control. pXJ41 and pXJ41-GST were worked as negative controls.
  At 24 ​h after transfection, cells were treated with 100 ​ng/mL of human IFN-γ.
  16 h later, cells were lysed and reporter expressions were measured using the Dual-Luciferase
  reporter assay kit (Promega). The values were normalized regarding Renilla luciferase
  activities. Then relative expression levels were calculated and shown as relative
  fold changes, compared with the mock-treated control of untransfected cells. Data
  represent the mean ​± ​the standard deviations (error bars) of three independent
  experiments. D Expression of 3ABC, 3A, 3B or 3C protein was detected by Western
  blotting using antibody against FLAG or antibody against HA. β-actin was used as
  a protein loading control. ∗, P ​< ​0.05.
