caption: 'Fasudil repressed the YAP1 signaling pathway in arterial smooth muscle tissues
  of rabbits. (A) GSE60887 dataset downloaded from the GEO database. The microarray
  analysis revealed that MAPK1 expression declined in Fasudil group compared with
  that in Sham group. P<0.05: Fasudil group vs. Sham group. (B, C) Decreased MYC and
  YAP1 expressions in Fasudil group in comparison with those in Sham group. P<0.05:
  Fasudil group vs. Sham group. (D, E) Co-expression analysis revealed that MAPK1
  was correlated with YAP1 and MYC. (F) Immunofluorescence staining for YAP1 andÎ±-SMA.
  Compared with that in Model group and Sham group, the YAP1-positive fluorescence
  area was significantly decreased after Fasudil treatment. P<0.05: Fasudil group
  vs. Sham group. (G) Western blotting demonstrated that YAP1 protein expression level
  was decreased in Fasudil group in contrast with that in Model group. P<0.05: Fasudil
  group vs. Model group.'
