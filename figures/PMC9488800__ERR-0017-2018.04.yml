caption: 'Leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H)-mediated degradation of Pro-Gly-Pro (PGP)
  is disturbed in chronic lung diseases. Neutrophils recruited to the lung release
  enzymes (matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and prolylendopeptidase (PE)) that proteolytically
  target collagen to generate PGP. To counteract this, LTA4H is released to degrade
  PGP and resolve neutrophilic inflammation. If this balance between PGP-generating
  and PGP-degrading enzymes is disturbed then PGP can persist and drive pathology.
  Cigarette smoke, a major risk factor for the development of chronic obstructive
  pulmonary disease, can promote the expression and/or release of MMPs and PE and
  ensuing PGP generation. Furthermore, cigarette smoke disturbs the LTA4H-mediated
  anti-inflammatory pathway in two ways: 1) chemically acetylating PGP (AcPGP) and
  protecting it from degradation by LTA4H; and 2) selective abrogation of LTA4H PGP-degrading
  activity. A protease imbalance is a hallmark of many chronic lung diseases, with
  neutrophil elastase prominently implicated in disease pathologies. Neutrophil elastase
  can promote MMP activation to facilitate PGP generation, whilst degrading extracellular
  LTA4H. Respiratory infections act to further spike PGP generation in a setting where
  degradation is impaired. As a result, AcPGP/PGP can drive neutrophilic inflammation
  and pathology. LTB4: leukotriene B4; IL: interleukin; BLT1: Leukotriene B4 receptor
