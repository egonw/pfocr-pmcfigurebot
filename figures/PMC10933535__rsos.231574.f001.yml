caption: Pathway diagram of the reconstructed signalling and metabolic interaction
  network for glioma, T-cell and macrophage in TIME. Signalling and metabolic systems
  are colour segregated for each cell (glioma, T-cell and macrophage). Output signalling
  molecules are represented in green colour and inhibitors in red. Interconnections
  between signalling molecules and metabolites are represented with dotted lines if
  they are activators (black) and inhibitors (red).
