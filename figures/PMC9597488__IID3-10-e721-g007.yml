caption: 'IL‐6‐induced signaling pathway and inflammation‐related protein changes
  were assessed in the spinal cord by Western blotting. (A–I): Levels of IL‐6, IL‐6Rα,
  JAK‐2, pJAK‐2, STAT3, pSTAT3 (Ser727), MIF, and Cox‐2 proteins in the spinal cord
  following intraplantar injection of Dexa (100 μg), Cane (200 μg), and the combination
  (Dexa 100 μg + Cane 200 μg). After intraplantar injection of Dexa and/or Cane, the
  IL‐6, pJAK2, pSTAT3 protein expression levels were reduced in FCA‐treated rats,
  and STAT3, MIF, Cox‐2 did not change between groups (p > .05). Values were normalized
  against GAPDH and expressed as a percentage of control. Data are expressed as mean ± SD
  (n = 6). *p < .05; **p < .01; ***p < .001. Statistical comparisons were conducted
  using one‐way ANOVA with Bonferroni''s test. ANOVA, analysis of variance; Cane,
  potassium canrenoate; Cox‐2, cyclooxygenase‐2; Dexa, dexamethasone; FCA, Freund''s
  complete adjuvant; IL‐6, interleukin‐6; IL‐6Rα, interleukin 6 receptor α; IOD, integrated
  optical density; JAK2, Janus kinase 2; MIF, macrophage migration inhibitory factor;
  STAT3, Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3.'

  regulating IL‐6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway during inflammatory pain in vivo and
  in vitro.
