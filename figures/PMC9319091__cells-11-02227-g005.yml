caption: 'Expression of miR-124a and its regulation of VMP1 in goat LD tissue: (A)
  Expression levels of miR-124a and VMP1 in mon1 and mon9 goat LD tissues. Data are
  presented as means ± standard error (SE); n = 3. (B) Western blot of VMP1 levels
  in the LD tissues is consistent with mRNA expression. (C) Relative luciferase activity
  was assayed 48 h after 293T cells were co-transfected with VMP1-3′-UTR wild-type
  or mutant dual-luciferase vectors, together with the miR-124a mimic or mimic negative
  control (NC). (D,E) Expression of VMP1 in goat myoblasts was detected by RT-qPCR
  in cells overexpressing and underexpressing VMP1. (F,G) Western blot of VMP1 in
  goat myoblasts overexpressing and underexpressing miR-124a. Replications = 3. Data
  are presented as the mean ± SE; * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01.'
