caption: No significant difference in inflammatory signaling exists between IPMKΔIECand
  control mice. (A) Although IPMK deletion exacerbates colitis phenotypes, expression
  of major inflammatory cytokines in colonic epithelial cells showed no difference
  between genotypes (n = 8, 5 per genotype). Data are presented as means ± SD. (B)
  The activity of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway, regulating inflammation and
  AKT signaling, and governing cell survival, was assessed by immunoblotting. The
  phosphorylation level of key proteins was not different between IPMKΔIEC and IPMKf/f
  mice. p-AKT; p-JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinases; p-NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa B.
