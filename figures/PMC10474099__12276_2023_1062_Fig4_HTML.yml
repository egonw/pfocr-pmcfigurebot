figure_title: Activating effect of SLC39A10 on the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways
  via an increase in the intracellular Zn2+ concentration
caption: a Representative images showing free intracellular Zn2+ in SLC39A10-overexpressing
  AGS and MKN45 cells and control cells under a confocal microscope (left panel).
  Blue indicates staining of nuclei. Green indicates staining of free intracellular
  Zn2+. Scale bars, 200 μm. b The free intracellular Zn2+ content, as measured by
  flow cytometry, is shown in the left panel, and the right panel shows the statistical
  results. Western blotting analysis showing the effect of SLC39A10 knockdown (c)
  and overexpression (d) on MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathway activity and c-Myc expression
  in AGS and MKN45 cells. β-Actin was used as a loading control. SLC39A10-overexpressing
  AGS and MKN45 cells and control cells were treated with 3.5 μM TPEN or vehicle for
  24 h, and the effects of these treatments on cell proliferation (e), colony formation
  (f) and MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathway activity (g) were evaluated by MTT, colony
  formation and western blotting assays. β-Actin was used as a loading control. The
  data are presented as the means ± SDs. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
