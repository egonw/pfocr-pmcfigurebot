caption: The detailed mechanism of exosomes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hepatoma
  carcinoma cells influence neighboring cells through exosomes and established tumorigenic
  microenvironment. On one hand, cancer cell-derived exosomes promote diffusion of
  tumor contents to normal cells, promote epithelial-mesenchymal transformation and
  tumor angiogenesis, and promote stellate cell activation that is related to liver
  fibrosis pathway. On the other hand, cancer cell-derived exosomes could present
  and deliver relevant information to activate the immune responses of the body or
  inhibit immune cell function to promote tumor immune-escape.
