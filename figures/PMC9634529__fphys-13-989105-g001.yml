caption: 4-PPanSH was associated with various degrees of CHD. (A) The VIP score analysis
  showed that M381T5 was the potential diagnostic marker in five groups. (B) Cluster
  analysis in the discovery cohort. (C) Enrichment analysis for differential metabolites
  revealed that coenzyme A biosynthesis is the most relevant signaling pathway. (D)
  The results of the semiquantitative analysis showed that both 4-PPanSH and TMAO
  were apparent differences in the NON-CA and CHD groups. (E) Semiquantitative analysis
  showed that 4-PPanSH was associated with different severity of CHD. *Indicates p
  < 0.05 compared to the NON-CA group.
