caption: Activated TGF-β1/SMAD2/3 pathway in BMSCs treated with Exo/Hydrogel. (A)
  Differential expression of genes between Exo/Hydrogel and control groups, the up-regulated,
  down-regulated, and unchanged genes were doted in red, green, and gray respectively.
  (B) KEGG enrichment analysis for differential expressed genes. (C) The top ten enriched
  signaling pathways associated with osteogenesis. (D) A cluster heatmap showed differentially
  expressed genes involved in TGF-β signaling pathway. (E) GSEA enrichment plots of
  gene set involved in TGF-β signaling pathway. (F) p-SMAD2/3 co-localized with the
  nucleus in BMSCs treated with Exo/Hydrogel. (G) Representative western blotting
  images of TGF-β1/SMAD2/3 pathway protein. (H) Semi-quantitative statistical analysis
  of TGF-β1, p-SMAD2 and p-SMAD3. Data were presented as the mean ± SD, *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001 analyzed by one-way ANOVA.
