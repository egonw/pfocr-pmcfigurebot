figure_title: The KLF5/Bcl-2/caspase 3 signaling pathway affects the oxaliplatin-induced
  apoptosis of CRC cells
caption: A Western blotting of KLF5, Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase 3 in CRC cell lines.
  B Knocking down Bcl-2 significantly promoted the expression of cleaved caspase 3,
  whereas knocking down Bax did not affect the expression of Bcl-2 or cleaved caspase
  3 (mean ± SD, n = 3 for each group, Student’s t-test, **P < 0.01, *** p < 0.001).
  C, D Western blotting showed that inhibiting Bcl-2 can reverse the function of KLF5
  in suppressing the expression of cleaved caspase 3, whereas inhibiting Bax cannot
  reverse the function of KLF5 in cleaved caspase 3 suppression (mean ± SD, n = 3
  for each group, one-way ANOVA, **P < 0.01, *** p < 0.001). E KLF5-binding elements
  (KBE1 to KBE3) on Bcl-2 promoter region. F ChIP verified the direct binding of KLF5
  to the predicted site (KBE1) of the Bcl-2 promoter (mean ± SD, n = 3 for each group,
  Student’s t-test, *** p < 0.001). G The results of luciferase reporter assay showed
  that KLF5 only promoted the luciferase activity of pGL3-Bcl2-FL (mean ± SD, n = 3
  for each group, Student’s t-test, *** p < 0.001). H Schematic diagram showed the
  mutation site of Bcl-2 Mut 1 and Bcl-2 Mut 2 plasmids. I The results of luciferase
  reporter assay showed that KLF5 could not promote the luciferase activity of Bcl-2
  Mut 1, which did not contain KBE1 sequence (mean ± SD, n = 3 for each group, Student’s
  t-test, **P < 0.01, *** p < 0.001).
