caption: 'Differential kidney expressions of genes between the wild-type and Kdm4c−/−
  mice. Kidney tissues of wild-type and Kdm4c−/− mice at the age of 10 weeks were
  used for this study (n = 8 in each group). (A). Volcano plot showing differential
  kidney gene expressions between the wild-type and Kdm4c−/− mice. The results showed
  that 42 genes had higher expression levels, while 46 genes had lower expression
  levels in the Kdm4c−/− mice than in the wild-type mice (p-value < 0.01, q-value
  < 0.01). (B). The KEGG pathway analysis results showed that Kdm4c deletion was also
  associated with a variety of neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic diseases.
  (C). GO enrichment analysis showed that the Kdm4c−/− mice had significantly different
  expressions in several pathways, including inner mitochondrial membrane protein
  complex and mitochondrial protein complex. (D). GSEA revealed that Kdm4c deletion
  was also associated with several pathways involved in mitochondrial function, including
  mitochondrial electron transport chain, oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial
  membrane phospholipid-based signal pathways. Abbreviation: KDM4C, lysine demethylase
  4C; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; GSEA, gene set enrichment analysis;
  WT, wild-type.'
