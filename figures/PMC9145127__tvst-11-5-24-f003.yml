caption: Off-responses in the eNpHR expressing retinas demonstrate unusually short
  delays while On-response latencies are consistent with the excitation of cone-driven
  pathway. Panel A plots an example of the per cell per flash averaged response obtained
  from one of the treated retinas (retina a), the Off-response is dominated by a very
  fast component followed by a slow decaying one. Panels B and C plot on a fast time
  scales examples of six On- and six Off-per flash averaged responses obtained from
  the individual cells identified in the retina a. Panels D and E plot per cell per
  flash averaged On- and Off-responses from all treated retinas, the color code and
  the total number of cells identified in each retina are given on the panel E. Panels
  F and G plot averaged responses from 5 different murine WT retinas (different colors
  indicate different retinas). To facilitate comparison of response latencies observed
  from different mouse retinas, responses shown on panels F and G were normalized
  to the unity amplitude. The dotted lines in panels D–G indicate response latencies.
  Traces on panel E were calculated with 2 ms time bin, 5 ms time bin was used to
  calculate all other traces. Baseline firing (measured before flash onset for the
  On-responses and before flash offset for the Off-responses) had been subtracted
  from all traces except that from the panel A. All plotted responses were to standard
  two-second flashes. Note that Off-response for the retina c is not shown because
  that retina produced On-responses only during standard stimulation series. Traces
  above firing rate graphs and colored bars on the graphs indicate light stimulation
  events, flash intensities are given on the figure.
