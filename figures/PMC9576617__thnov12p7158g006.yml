caption: 'PA-S14 protects against renal fibrosis and tubular cell senescence in UIRI
  mice. (A) The heatmap, generated from the RNA-seq analysis, showing cellular senescence,
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and collagen fibril organization gene expression
  in UIRI and UIRI/PA-S14 groups. (B-F) Representative western blot and quantitative
  data showing renal expression of active-β-catenin, p16INK4A, Klotho and KIM-1. Numbers
  (1-3) indicate each individual animal in a given group. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001
  versus sham controls; ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001 versus UIRI (n = 5). (G) Representative
  micrographs show the expression of active β-catenin, Klotho, KIM-1, and SA‐β‐gal
  activity in different groups as indicated. Frozen kidney sections were stained for
  active β-catenin expression and SA‐β‐gal activity. Paraffin sections were stained
  with antibodies against Klotho and KIM-1, respectively. Arrows indicate positive
  staining. Scale bar, 50 µm. (H-I) Representative western blot and quantitative data
  show the reduction of renal Fibronectin, Collagen I, and α‐SMA expression after
  PA-S14 treatment. Numbers (1-3) indicate each individual animal in given group.
  **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 versus sham controls; ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001 versus UIRI
  (n = 5). (J) Representative staining micrographs show Sirius red staining, and renal
  expression of Fibronectin and α‐SMA. Paraffin sections were performed to Sirius
  red staining or immunostained with antibodies against Fibronectin and α‐SMA. Arrows
  indicate positive staining. Scale bar, 50 µm. (K) Graphical representations of the
  degree of fibrotic lesions in different groups after quantitative determination
  of Sirius red staining intensity. ***P < 0.001 versus sham controls; ###P < 0.001
  versus UIRI (n = 5). (L) Urinary albumin levels in different groups. Urinary albumin
  was expressed as milligrams per milligram creatinine. **P < 0.01 versus sham controls;
  ##P < 0.01 versus UIRI (n = 5). (M-N) The treatment of PA-S14 significantly decreased
  serum creatinine and BUN levels. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 versus sham controls;
  ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001 versus UIRI (n = 5).'
