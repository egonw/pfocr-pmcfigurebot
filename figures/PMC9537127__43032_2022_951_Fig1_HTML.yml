caption: 'Hypothetical pathophysiological pathways to adverse pregnancy outcomes:
  Panel A indicates the conventional hypothesis that adverse pregnancy outcomes (here
  represented by preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction) each has a distinct, single
  pathway. Panel B presents an evolving hypothesis that there are several pathways
  to adverse outcomes with different pathways to each outcome. In panel C, an alternate
  hypothesis suggests there are multiple pathways to adverse outcomes, and these are
  shared by all outcomes. The particular adverse outcome is determined by the maternal
  response to the insult (e.g., the same insult in different women can lead to preeclampsia
  or fetal growth restriction). For simplicity, pathways are shown as independent
  but it is likely there are complex interactions between pathways'
