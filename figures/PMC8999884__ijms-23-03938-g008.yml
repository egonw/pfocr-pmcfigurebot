caption: 'Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP)—induced elevated migratory potential
  of human endometrial epithelial cells. Representative photomicrographs (100×) of
  Ishikawa cells migrating to the cell-free space under a phase contrast microscope.
  Images were captured at 0 and 24 h. The distances between the two edges are scaled
  for three positions at different times. All data are expressed as relative values
  against their respective control group. Data represent the mean ± standard deviation
  of three independent experiments. ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001 (vs. control); ###
  p < 0.001 (vs. DEHP treatment).'

  and Epithelial–Mesenchymal Transition in Human Endometrial and Endometriotic Epithelial
  Cells via the Transforming Growth Factor-β/Smad Signaling Pathway.
