caption: Overview of the MDM2–p53 pathway in response to DNA damage. In the absence
  of DNA damage, MDM2 facilitates ubiquitination of p53, tagging it for proteosomal
  degradation. Damage to DNA activates kinases, including ataxia telangiectasia-mutated
  (ATM) kinase, which are responsible for phosphorylating MDM2 and reducing its affinity
  to bind cytosolic p53. Regulators of the MDM2–p53 interaction include the AKT/mTOR
  pathway, ARF, and c-MYC. Downstream transcriptional targets of p53 serve to arrest
  cell-cycle progression and induce cellular apoptosis. Multiple sites of action are
  targeted by MDM2 and MDM2–p53 inhibitors, which decrease p53 degradation in tumors
  with wild-type p53. Created with BioRender.com.
