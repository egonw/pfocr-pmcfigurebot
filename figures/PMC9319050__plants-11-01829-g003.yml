caption: Fold-change (FC) of metabolic processes in leaves and roots of UV treated
  plants, at 11 days of treatment and after 3 days of recovery, with respect to control
  plants. FC values were elaborated by the Omics Viewer Dashboard of the PlantCyc
  Pathway Tool software. Data for each biochemical pathway represent the sum of Log2FC
  of each detected compound. Syn, biosynthesis; Deg, degradation; FA/Lip, fatty acids
  and lipids; Carbo, carbohydrates; Sec Metab, secondary metabolites; AA, amino acids.

  Micro-Tom Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) Plants Associated with a Gene Expression
  Analysis in Response to Short Daily UV Treatments.
