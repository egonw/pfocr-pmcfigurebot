caption: PTP1B knockdown inhibits ox-LDL-induced inflammatory injury of HUVECs. (A)
  The levels of IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α were detected using ELISA. (B) Cell apoptosis
  was measured by TUNEL assay. Scale bar, 50 µm. (C) Histogram of the quantified apoptosis
  rate of HUVECs. (D) Protein expression levels of Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and
  caspase-3 were measured and semi-quantified via western blotting. Results represent
  the mean ± SD. **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001. PTP1B, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B;
  ox-LDL, oxidized low-density lipoprotein; sh, short-hairpin; NC, negative control.
article_title: PTP1B inhibition ameliorates inflammatory injury and dysfunction in
  ox-LDL-induced HUVECs by activating the AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway via negative
  regulation of KLF2.
