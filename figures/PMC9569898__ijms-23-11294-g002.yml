caption: IHC to detect KLB in rats. The lumen surface of the uterus on the operative
  side (IUA side) was discontinuous, the uterine lumen was narrowed, and the glands
  of the damaged uterus were decreased. KLB was expressed in both epithelial and stromal
  cells of the rats, and KLB staining on the operative side was stronger than on the
  non-operative side. Statistical analysis of eight pairs of rat endometrial sections
  (400×) with ESCs showed significant differences (p = 0.0141).
