caption: Transcriptional changes in MAPK-pathway related genes. Heatmap showing genes
  related to the MAPK gene set (MSigDB, gene set enrichment analysis) differentially
  expressed between wild−type and rd1 rod and cone photoreceptors (p-value ≤ 0.5;
  |avg_log2FC| > 0.3) for the post-natal (P) day 11, P13, and P17 time−points. Blue
  indicates downregulated genes, red indicates upregulation. A total of 46 MAPK pathway
  genes were significantly altered in rods, whereas six genes were altered in cones.
