figure_title: The CPT score represents immunogenic microenvironment in MIBC
caption: a Non-parametric two-sided Spearman correlation analysis was performed to
  figure out the correlations between CD39+ cells infiltration and CD8+ cells infiltration
  in ZSHS cohort. b Association between CD39+ cells infiltration and immunotypes in
  ZSHS cohort. Kruskal–Wallis test was performed (*P < 0.05). c Association between
  CD39+ cells infiltration and tertiary lymphoid structures in ZSHS cohort. Mann–Whitney
  U-test was performed. d Heatmap depicting the correlation of CPT score with immune
  indicators in IMvigor210 cohort. Chi-square test was performed for TCGA subtype
  and immune phenotype (**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001). Kruskal–Wallis test was performed
  for signatures and pathway scores (***P < 0.001). TLS tertiary lymphoid structure.
