figure_title: Natural suppressors of the Regulator of Ace2 and Morphogenesis (RAM)
  pathway cbk1Î” mutant restore multiple defects
caption: (A) Protein diagram of Psc1 showing the effects and positions of suppressor
  mutations in the two sup1 type natural suppressors. (B) Protein diagram of Ssd1
  and the effects and positions of suppressor mutations in Ssd1 in the nine sup2 type
  natural suppressors. STOP indicates a non-sense mutation, MS a missense mutation,
  and FS a frameshift mutation. Asterisks (*) indicate mutations in the same suppressor
  strain. (C) Serial dilutions of H99 and the mutant strains were spotted onto yeast
  peptone dextrose (YPD) agar media and incubated for 2 days in the indicated condition
  to observe growth. (D) The cellular morphology of H99 and the mutant strains in
  liquid YPD cultures were examined under microscope.
