figure_title: Schematic summary for role of NELL2 in PPE gene expression
caption: NELL2 is involved in a functionally opposing dual-faced mechanism in PPE
  gene transcription. ER-localized NELL2 inhibits Ca+-mediated and PKC-ERK-cFos-dependent
  signaling and suppresses PPE gene transcription during its release process. Once
  released, NELL2 binds its unknown receptor and stimulates PKC-ERK-cFos signaling
  pathway and subsequently activates PPE transcription. Dotted lines represent inhibitory
  action of ER-localized NELL2 and solid lines represent stimulatory action of released
  NELL2.
