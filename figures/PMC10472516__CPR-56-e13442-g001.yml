caption: Mitochondrial transfer of mBMSCs protects mDPC6T cells from mitochondrial
  dysfunction, NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis. (A) Schematic representation
  of the strategy to capture mDPC6T cells in cocultured cells. mDPC6T‐CFSE cells were
  subjected to coculture with mBMSCs, followed by cell sorting using FACS. CFSE‐positive
  cells were collected and then used for further analysis. (B,C) Immunoblotting analysis
  of Tom20 and Cyto C protein expression in mDPC6T cells and LA‐mDPC6T cells alone
  or cocultured with (ρo)mBMSCs (n = 3). (D–G) Flow cytometry analysis of TMRM and
  MitoSOX in mDPC6T cells and LA‐mDPC6T cells alone or cocultured with (ρo)mBMSCs
  (n = 3). (H,I) Immunoblotting analysis of NLRP3, caspase1 and IL‐1β protein expression
  (n = 3), (J) qPCR analysis of IL‐6 and CXCL10 mRNA expression (n = 3) and (K) caspase1
  activity in mDPC6T cells and LA‐mDPC6T cells alone or cocultured with (ρo)mBMSCs
  (n = 4). (L) ELISA analysis of IL‐1β levels in the cell culture medium of mDPC6T
  cells and LA‐mDPC6T cells alone or cocultured with (ρo)mBMSCs (n = 3). (M) GSEA
  results of the NLR pathway in LA‐mDPC6T versus mDPC6T cells and LA‐mDPC6T + mBMSCs
  versus LA‐mDPC6T cells. (N) Heatmap showing the expression of metabolic genes in
  mDPC6T cells and LA‐mDPC6T cells alone or cocultured with mBMSCs. (O) GO enrichment
  analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between LA‐mDPC6T cells and
  LA‐mDPC6T + mBMSCs. Data are displayed as the mean ± SD. Statistical significance
  was determined using one‐way analysis of variance (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001).
