caption: AtmosO2 exposure disrupts embryonic metabolic shift that couples histone
  lactylation deposition.(A) Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) plot showing the dynamic
  activity of glycolysis in 5% O2- and 20% O2-exposed IVF preimplantation embryos.
  Error bars, means ± SD; *P < 0.05, by two-tailed Student's t-test; †††P < 0.001,
  by Welch's t-test.(B) GSEA plot showing enrichment of glycolysis pathway between
  5% O2- and 20% O2-exposed early (red) and late (blue) blastocysts.(C) Heatmap showing
  the fold change of glycolysis pathway-related DEGs between 5% O2- and 20% O2- exposed
  early and late blastocysts.(D) RT-qPCR analysis of selected glycolysis-related DEGs
  in 5% O2- and 20% O2-exposed blastocysts. Error bars, means ± SD; **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001,
  by two-tailed Student's t-test.(E) Quantification of glycolysis-dependent ATP production
  detected by 2-Deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) treatment in 5% O2-and 20% O2- exposed blastocysts.
  Error bars, means ± SD; *P < 0.05, by two-tailed Student's t-test.(F–G) Representative
  immunostaining images of Pan Kla (F, left panel) and H4K12la (G, left panel) in
  5% O2- and 20% O2-exposed IVF blastocysts. Quantification of fluorescent intensity
  was shown in right panels respectively. Error bars, means ± SD; ***P < 0.001, by
  Welch's t-test in (F) and two-tailed Student's t-test in (G).(H) Immunoblotting
  of Pan Kla and H4K12la in 5% O2- and 20% O2- exposed IVF blastocysts.(I) Venn diagram
  showing the overlap of H4K12la-enriched genes with 20% O2 exposure-upregulated/downregulated
  genes in early blastocysts(J) Comparison of H4K12la enrichment at promoters of H4K12la
  targeted genes among IVO, 5% O2- and 20% O2- exposed blastocysts. Error bars, means ± SD;
  the significance was determined by two-tailed Student's t-test.(K) Schematic diagram
  of reconstructed interaction network of glycolysis pathway and HIF-1α signaling
  in early blastocysts, and their functionally associated DEGs.(L) Spearman correlation
  between glycolysis pathway and HIF-1α signaling pathway.Scale bars, 50 μm. Data
  are shown as means ± SD of at least three independent experiments. (For interpretation
  of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
