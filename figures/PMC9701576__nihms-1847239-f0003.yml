caption: Androgen receptor (AR)-mediated regulation of prostate cancer. Directionality
  of the arrows (up = increase, down = decrease) and font color (red = increase, green
  = decrease) indicate the expression level of these drivers in Black men compared
  to White men with prostate cancer. Canonical AR signaling is mediated through androgen
  binding AR in the cytoplasm, which leads to a conformational change in AR causing
  it to dimerize. Upon dimerization, AR translocates to the nucleus and binds to androgen
  response elements (ARE) to allow transcription of many cancer-related genes. In
  Black men with prostate cancer, PSA and c-Myc levels are higher and TMPRSS2/ERG
  fusion rates are lower compared to White men with prostate cancer. A non-canonical
  AR signaling pathway mediated through PI3K and Akt also regulates AR signaling via
  phosphorylation. Many components of the PI3K pathway are upregulated in Black men
  with prostate cancer, including increased serum levels of growth factors, increased
  MNX1 activity, and preferential deletion of RGS12, leading to higher transcription
  of lipid metabolism genes such as SREBP1 and FASN.
