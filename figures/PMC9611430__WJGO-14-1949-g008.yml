caption: 'Overexpression of ELL-associated factor 2 inhibited tumor-induced angiogenesis
  in RKO cells via the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3/transforming
  growth factor beta 1 pathway. A: Conditioned medium from RKO cells transfected with
  ELL-associated factor 2-overexpressed plasmids or treated with transforming growth
  factor beta 1 recombinant protein was collected to perform tube formation assay;
  B: Migration ability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) analyzed
  by transwell migration assay; C: Migration ability of HUVECs analyzed by wound healing
  assay. And the results were measured with ImageJ software. The data are shown as
  the mean ± SD. aP < 0.05, bP < 0.001. RKO-C: The group of human umbilical vein endothelial
  cells cultured with conditioned medium from RKO cells cultured with 10% serum for
  24 h; EAF2-OV: The group of human umbilical vein endothelial cells cultured with
  conditioned medium from RKO cells transfected with ELL-associated factor 2-overexpressed
  plasmids for 24 h; RKO + T: The group of human umbilical vein endothelial cells
  cultured with conditioned medium from RKO cells treated with 5 ng/mL transforming
  growth factor-β1 pathway recombinant protein for 24 h; EAF2-OV + T: The group of
  human umbilical vein endothelial cells cultured with conditioned medium from RKO
  cells which were transfected with EAF-OV plasmid for 24 h and then cultured with
  5 ng/mL transforming growth factor beta 1 pathway recombinant protein for 24 h.'
