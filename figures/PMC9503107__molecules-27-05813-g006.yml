caption: Effect of CNP extract and resveratrol on the translocation of Nrf2 transcription
  factor into the nucleus. HT22 cells were treated with 50 μg/mL CNP extract or 5
  μM resveratrol for 24 h. The cells were assessed via fluorescent staining with Alexa
  Fluor 594 (red color) to indicate the Nrf2 protein. DAPI (blue color) fluorescent
  nuclear staining was performed. Then, the cells were observed under confocal microscopy
  (scale bar is 10 μm).
