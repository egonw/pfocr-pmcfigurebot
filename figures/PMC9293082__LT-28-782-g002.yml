caption: 71D6 promotes hepatic proliferation following hepatectomy of cirrhotic mice
  through activation of the ERK signaling pathway. (A) Hepatic proliferation is expressed
  as the number of PCNA‐positive cells per liver section analyzed. Representative
  images are shown below the graph. The bar is 250 µM. (B) The levels of phosphorylated
  and total ERK1/2 (p44/p42) were determined by Western blot analysis of liver samples.
  The ratio between phosphorylated ERK1/2 and total ERK1/2 was determined by densitometric
  analysis. (C) Serum HGF levels in mice of the control and 71D6 groups as well as
  in healthy, naïve animals were determined by ELISA. (D) Serum 71D6 levels in mice
  of the 71D6 group were determined by ELISA.
