caption: 'Schematic overview of the main TNT degradation pathways in Pseudomonas spp.
  under aerobic conditions. (a) The peripheral pathways nitroreduction and denitration
  are shown with red and blue arrows, respectively. Furthermore, the central pathway
  β-ketoadipate is shown with green arrows. Discontinuous arrows indicate the proposed
  steps. TNT-degrading enzymes are as follows: xenobiotic reductase B (XenB), xenobiotic
  reductase E (XenE), azoreductase potentially involved (AzoR?), nitroreductase (NitroR),
  old yellow enzymes (OYEs), and unidentified enzyme (?). Unique enzymes of TNT isolates
  are shown in red letters. 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene (TNT), 4-nitroso-2,6-dinitrotoluene
  (4NoDNT), 4-hydroxylamino-2,6-dinitrotoluene (4HADNT), 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene
  (4ADNT), 2-nitroso-4,6-dinitrotoluene (2NoDNT), 2-hydroxylamino-4,6-dinitrotoluene
  (2HADNT), 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene (2ADNT), hydride-Meisenheimer complex (H¯-TNT),
  dihydride-Meisenheimer complex (2H¯-TNT), 2-hydroxylamino-6-nitrotoluene (2HA6NT),
  2,4-dinitrotoluene (24DNT), 2-nitrotoluene (2NT), toluene (Tol), tricarboxylic acid
  cycle (TCA cycle), nitrite (NO2ˉ); (b) β-ketoadipate pathway composed of ortho-catechol
  cleavage (above) and protocatechuate (below) branches. The degradation pathways
  of some xenobiotics (e.g., nitroaromatics, benzene, etc.) converge in catechol,
  while others (e.g., phthalate, p-cresols) can converge in protocatechuate. TNT degradation
  pathways could also converge in the latter (TNT?). Unique enzymes of TNT isolates
  are shown in red letters. Enzymes involved in ortho-catechol branch are catechol
  1,2-dioxygenase (C1,2O), cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzyme (MLE), and muconolactone
  isomerase (MI). Enzymes involved in protocatechuate branch are protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase
  (P3,4O), β-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate lactonizing (CMLE), and γ-carboxy-muconolactone
  decarboxylase (CMD). Enzymes shared by both branches are β-ketoadipate enol-lactone
  hydrolase (ELH), β-ketoadipate succinyl-CoA transferase (TR), and β-ketoadipyl-CoA
  thiolase (TH). β-subunit (β).'
