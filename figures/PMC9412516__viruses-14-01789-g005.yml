caption: KEGG pathway and interaction network analyses of the differentially expressed
  ubiquitinated proteins in CWMV-infected wheat. (A) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
  of the differentially expressed ubiquitinated proteins. The Rich factor indicated
  the ratio of the differentially expressed ubiquitinated protein numbers annotated
  in this pathway term to all gene numbers annotated in this pathway term. The Q-value
  is the corrected p-value, ranging from 0 to 1, with lower values suggesting greater
  intensiveness. The circles represent the number of enriched genes, with the larger
  circles indicating more enriched genes. (B) Heatmap shows hierarchical clustering
  of significantly differentially expressed genes, which enriched plant–pathogen interaction,
  response to stress, and response to hormone pathways. The relative protein abundance
  was normalized by Z-score standardization. (C) Interaction networks for all the
  identified differentially expressed ubiquitinated proteins in CWMV-infected wheat.
