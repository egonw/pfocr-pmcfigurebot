caption: 'Comparative heat-map of hits displaying scaled readouts for viability, motility,
  and pigmentation is shown (two duplicates for each drug and two different batches
  of larvae, “1” and “2” were used). Viability: 40 iL3 per well were incubated with
  compounds of interest at 100 µM for 4 days. After 72 h, Sytox Green was added to
  the culture and viability was acquired by spectrophotometric measurement 24 h later.
  Motility: compounds with an effect that was greater than that obtained for the reference
  compound (QND) were further scored for motility under bright-field microscopy. Pigmentation:
  Compounds with an effect that was greater than that obtained for the reference compound
  (QND) were also scored under bright-field microscopy for the presence/degradation
  of a hemozoin-like compound. All measurements were performed in the same experiment.
  Values were Z-scored for each readout (centred of the mean of the data), negative
  Z-scores (lower fitness) are shown in dark blue, and positive Z-scores (higher fitness)
  are shown in yellow. Clusters are shown on the left and numbered 1–8.'
