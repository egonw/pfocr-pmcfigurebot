caption: Enrichment analysis based on Go terms for proteomic data. (A) GoCircle-plot
  that includes significant over-represented GoTerms in a table (ID and Name) and
  scatter plot with FC of any gene related with each GoTerm. Moreover, this plot includes
  Z-score which is an estimation of up-regulation or down-regulation in the Goterm.
  (B) Circus-Plot applied to Goterms to relate any Gene name with the corresponding
  GoTerm name. The plot also shows the FC of each gene, and the list is sorted by
  FC from the most over-expressed (3) up to the most under-expressed (−3).
