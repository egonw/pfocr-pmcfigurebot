caption: An increase in C/EBPβ expression by the ERK signaling pathway enhances TLR4
  expression and then upregulates PD‐L1 transcription. (a) TL1 cells were treated
  with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (gefitinib), a MEK/ERK inhibitor (U0126), a PI3K/AKT
  inhibitor (LY294002), or an NF‐κB inhibitor (BAY) for 48 hours. the changes in expression
  of p‐ERK, ERK, p‐C/EBPβ (Thr 235), C/EBPβ, TLR4 and PD‐L1 in response to these inhibitors
  were evaluated by Western blotting. (b) A549 cells were treated with gefitinib,
  U0126, LY294002, BAY, and/or E6 expression plasmid for 48 hours and then the changes
  in expression of E6, p‐ERK, ERK, p‐C/EBPβ (Thr 235), C/EBPβ, TLR4, and PD‐L1 were
  evaluated by Western blotting. The ability of C/EBPβ to bind to the putative binding
  site on the TLR4 promoter was determined by ChIP analysis. (c) H1975 and H1650 cells
  were treated with gefitinib, U0126, LY294002, or BAY for 48 hours and then the changes
  in expression of EGFR, p‐ERK, ERK, p‐C/EBPβ (Thr 235), C/EBPβ, TLR4, and PD‐L1 were
  evaluated by Western blotting. (d) H1975 cells were transfected with shEGFR and
  A549 and TL4 cells were transfected with EGFR L858R expression plasmid for 48 hours
  and then the expressions of EGFR, p‐ERK, ERK, C/EBPβ, TLR4, and PD‐L1 were evaluated
  by Western blotting. β‐Actin was used as a loading control. PD‐L1, programmed death
