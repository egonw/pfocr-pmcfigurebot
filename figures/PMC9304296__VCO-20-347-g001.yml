caption: TopBP1 interactions. TopBP1 contains 8 BRCT domains through which it binds
  different DDR components, and one AAD through which it interacts with ATR kinase.
  After DNA damage, MDC1 is recruited to the damage site. It binds γH2AX at serine
  139 and helps in the recruitment of MRN complex. It also binds the 5th BRCT domain
  of TopBP1, which is recruited to this DNA damage site by interaction with MRN and
  Rad9. ATR is recruited to the RPA‐coated ssDNA, but it is not enough to be activated.
  TopBP1 interacts with ATR through its ADD domain helping ATR activation in a ATRIP
  dependent manner.,  This is how TopBP1 participates in the activation of ATR‐Chk1
  pathway as a response to DNA damage.,  Interestingly, it was shown that 53BP1 can
  bind TopBP1 along with Rad9, and cooperate in the activation of ATR to control G1/S
  checkpoint
