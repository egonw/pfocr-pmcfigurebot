caption: 'JAK and STAT inhibitors affected the suppression of RNase 7 in UPEC-infected
  bladder cells in a high-glucose environment. SV-HUC-1 cells were pretreated with
  25 μg/mL RNase 7 and simultaneously with 25 μM JAK inhibitor or 50 μM STAT inhibitor
  for 24 h, followed by UPEC infection (MOI:100) as described above. Cells pretreated
  with 25 μM JAK inhibitor or STAT3 inhibitor alone for 24 h followed by UPEC infection
  were used as respective controls. Cells infected with 15 mM glucose and UPEC alone
  were used as the respective positive controls. The definitions of each letter represented
  by the X axis are: C: control; G: with 15 mM glucose pretreatment alone; A: pretreated
  with 25 μg/mL RNase 7; AJ: coincubated with 25 μg/mL RNase 7 and 25 μM JAK inhibitor;
  AS: coincubated with 25 μg/mL RNase 7 and 50 μM STAT inhibitor; J: cells pretreated
  with 25 μM JAK inhibitor alone; S: Cells pretreated with STAT inhibitor alone. The
  picture shown is representative of a typical result. Twenty-four hours post-infection,
  all infected cells were (A) lysed and plated on LB agar and (B) measured using ImageJ
  software to analyze UPEC colonization. Colony-forming units (CFUs) were acquired
  after plating 10-fold dilutions of infected cells with lysis. Data are expressed
  as mean ± SD of three separate experiments. *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001, compared
  to UPEC infection control groups. ## p < 0.01, compared between the two indicated
  groups.'
