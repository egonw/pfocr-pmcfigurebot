caption: 'Three possible scenarios for the integration of Hh signaling transduction
  within the primary cilium in three bilaterian branches: Ecdysozoa, Lophotrochozoa,
  and Deuterostomia. (A) According to the first scenario, cilium-dependent Hh signaling
  emerged at the level of the last common ancestor of most bilaterian animals (LCA).
  In the Deuterostomia (D) lineage, this condition was retained, whereas in the Ecdysozoa
  (E) lineage, the Hh pathwayâ€™s association with the cilium was preserved only in
  particular cell types. In the Lophotrochozoa (L) lineage, this association was lost.
  (B) The second scenario assumes a cilium-independent Hh pathway in the LCA. In this
  case, D and E independently linked Hh signaling to the cilium. (C) In the third
  scenario, cilium-dependent Hh signaling existed initially, but its high evolutionary
  lability at the level of intracellular messengers does not allow generalizable conclusions
  to be drawn for large taxa (D, E, L). Single model animals from a huge number of
  Ecdysozoa and Lophotrochozoa species could have independently lost their connection
  between Hh and the cilium at different stages of signal transduction, but this does
  not reflect the state of the Hh pathway in the Protostomia ancestor.'
