caption: 'Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) augments human endometrial epithelial
  cell stemness traits through transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling pathway.
  (A) SOX2, OCT4, NANOG, and KLF4 levels detected using Western blotting after 5,
  10, and 25 µM DEHP treatment for 24 h. (B) Western blot analysis showing the alleviated
  SOX2, OCT4, NANOG, and KLF4 protein expression levels via inhibiting the TGF-β signaling
  pathway. β-actin was used as the internal loading control for data normalization.
  All data are expressed as relative values against their respective control group.
  Data represent the mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments. *
  p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 (vs. control); ### p < 0.001 (vs. DEHP
  treatment).'
