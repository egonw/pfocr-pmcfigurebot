caption: KLF7 promotes COAD progression by activating the MAPK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, and
  JAK/STAT3 signaling pathways through PDGFB. (A-B) PDGFB expression in COAD with
  different stages in GEPIA (A) and TCGA (B). (C-E) Effects of PDGFB in KLF7 transient
  knockdown or control LoVo cells were determined by MTT (C), migration (D), and Western
  Blot analysis (E). Cells were transfected with siRNA negative control (NC) or siKLF7
  for 12 hours, followed by an additional 48 hours of transfection with empty vector
  (EV) or PDGFB overexpression vector (PDGFB). a Thereafter cells were collected for
  Western blot analysis, or seeded for MTT and Transwell migration assay (n=3). (F,
  G) MTT assays (F) and Transwell migration assay (G) were used to assess the effects
  of Sunitinib (5 nM) on LoVo cells (n=3). (H) Western blot analysis of the PDGFB
  downstream signaling in SW620 cells treated with the indicated concentration of
  Sunitinib for 48 hours after 12 hours transfection with empty vector (EV) or KLF7
  overexpression. Representative images of the Transwell migration assay (D, G) and
  Western blot (E, H) are presented. Bar, 200 Âµm. ns, not significant, *P<0.05, **
  P<0.01 and ***P<0.001.
