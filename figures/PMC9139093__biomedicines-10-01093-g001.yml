caption: 'Changes in CD (Crohn’s Disease) intestinal tissue cytokines: (a) Surgical
  resections from control and B2- and B3-CD patients were frozen for qRT-PCR analysis.
  Graph shows quantification of the mRNA expression of cytokines. Data correspond
  to relative values vs. expression of the housekeeping gene, and are calculated as
  fold induction vs. the non-IBD (non- Inflammatory Bowel Disease) group (n = 10 per
  group); (b) Secretomes from B2 (n = 10) and B3 (n = 10) patients and control donors
  (n = 10) were evaluated for the presence of IFNγ by ELISA. The data presented are
  the mean IFNγ concentrations ± SEM in CD patients and control donors; (c) Graph
  shows protein expression of the IFNγ receptor (AF-1). Images correspond to a Western
  blot representation of 4 patients in each group (n = 12 per group). In all cases,
  bars represent mean ± SEM. Significant differences vs. the non-IBD group are shown
  by * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 or *** p < 0.001 and vs. the B2-CD samples by # p < 0.05.'
