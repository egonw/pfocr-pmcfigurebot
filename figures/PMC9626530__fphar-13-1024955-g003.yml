caption: Mechanisms of action of celastrol in neurological diseases. Similar to triptolide,
  celastrol has therapeutic potential in neurological diseases, with related mechanisms
  of action including inhibition of neuroinflammation and promotion of neuroprotection.
  The NF-kB signaling pathway is also involved in the action of celastrol, and celastrol
  can also act directly on neurons, thereby exerting neuroprotective effects. Notably,
  although many studies have identified neurotrophic effects of triptolide, similar
  results have not been reported in studies related to celastrol.
