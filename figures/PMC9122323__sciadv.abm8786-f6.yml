figure_title: Suppression of GSK3 sensitizes cells to SHIN1 treatment
caption: '(A) Clonogenic assay was performed with cells treated with the indicated
  concentration of SHIN1 in the presence or absence of 1 μM CHIR99021. (B) Cell proliferation
  was estimated by quantification of clonogenic cell growth as described in Materials
  and Methods. (C and D) 1 × 106 of NCI-H1299 cells were injected into mice through
  subcutaneous inoculation as described in Materials and Methods. Mice were treated
  with vehicle, SHIN1 (100 mg/kg), CHIR99021 (10 mg/kg), or SHIN1 plus CHIR99021 three
  times a week, and tumors were extracted after 3 weeks (n = 5 mice per group, and
  n = 4 in the SHIN1 group). Values are expressed as means ± SD. Two-tailed Student’s
  t test, **P < 0.01. (E) Model: Nuclear enrichment of GSK3 suppresses the expression
  of multiple genes including PHGDH, PSAT1, PSPH, SHMT2, and MTHFD2 and subsequently
  suppresses serine/one-carbon metabolism. Increased expression of FRAT1/2 facilitates
  nuclear exclusion of GSK3 and promotes serine/one-carbon metabolism, which therefore
  confers a metabolic vulnerability to inhibition of this pathway. Consequently, FRAT1/2-expressing
  cells are relatively sensitive to inhibitors targeting serine/one-carbon metabolism
  such as the SHMT1/2 inhibitor, SHIN1. Thus, inhibition of GSK3 through treatment
  with the pharmacologic inhibitor CHIR99021 effectively mimics FRAT1/2 expression
  and synergizes with SHIN1 treatment to enhance its anticancer effect both in cells
  and in vivo. **P < 0.01.'
