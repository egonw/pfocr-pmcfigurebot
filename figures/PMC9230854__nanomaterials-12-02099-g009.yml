caption: Differential recuperating effects of KAuCl4 on IAA-mediated effects on the
  genes involved in the auxin pathway in the root. Wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings
  were hydroponically grown in the NR medium for 7 d and then transferred to NR, NR.IAA,
  and NR.IAA.KAuCl4 for a further 7 d, as described in the legend of . Roots were
  harvested, and the relative expression levels of the genes involved in auxin biosynthesis,
  its influx, intracellular transporters, and signaling were assayed by qRT-PCR. ACT2
  was used as an internal control. Values are means Â± SE (n = 6) and different letters
  on the histograms indicate significant differences (p < 0.05). Blue and red dots
  on the histogram indicate the suppression and induction of the genes, respectively,
  in response to NR.IAA treatment and their subsequent recuperation upon treatment
  with NR.IAA.KAuCl4.
