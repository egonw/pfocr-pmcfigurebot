caption: Insulin secretion in response to different glucose concentration and mRNA
  levels of intracellular mediators of insulin signaling pathway. (A) Insulin secretion
  at 3.3 and 16.7 mM glucose by islets isolated from C (white bars) and YM (black
  bars) rats. Values were expressed as ng of insulin per islet/h. Bars represent means
  ± SEM from three independent experiments. * p < 0.05. (B–E) mRNA relative expression
  (RT qPCR) of insulin receptor (B), IRS-1 (C), IRS-2 (D) and p110 catalytic subunit
  of PI3K (E) in islets isolated from C (white bars) and YM (black bars) rats. β-actin
  was used as housekeeping gene. Values were expressed as arbitrary units (AU) compared
  to mRNA level determined in C islets. Each bar represents mean ± SEM from three
  independent experiments. * p < 0.05 vs. C.
