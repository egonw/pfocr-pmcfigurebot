figure_title: A model for the role of the sequential modification of ERα by UFM1 and
  ubiquitin in the transactivation pathway
caption: The UFM1-conjugating system (UFM1-S) generates poly-UFM1 chains on both ASC1
  and ERα. Poly-UFM1 chains ligated to ERα blocks ubiquitination, whereas poly-UFM1
  chains on ASC1 recruit other transcriptional coactivators (CoAs) to form transcriptional
  complexes with RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Once transcription proceeds, both ERα
  and ASC1 are deufmylated by UFSP2 and then ubiquitinated by ubiquitin E3 ligases
  for degradation by proteasome (26S). The resulting empty ERE can accommodate new
  estradiol-bound ERα for the next round of transcription. The blue circles in the
  ERα dimer indicate estradiol.
