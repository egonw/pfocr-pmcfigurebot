caption: PC-3 xenograft growth-suppressing activity of chrysin in athymic nude mice.
  (A) Diagram of animal study plans and time points; PC-3 cells (1 × 106 cells/100
  µL) were mixed with Matrigel (BD, 50% in 100 µL) and were injected subcutaneously
  into mice’s flank. After 3 days, chrysin or vehicle was orally administered daily
  for three weeks. (B) Final tumor weight at termination of the experiment. Photographs
  of dissected tumors. Values are mean ± SD, n = 6, and *** p < 0.001 compared to
  control. (C) Body weights of mice.
