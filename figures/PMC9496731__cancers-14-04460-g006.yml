caption: 'Supervised learning and pathway analysis from metabolic footprinting of
  patient-derived explant cultures reveals discriminating metabolic features between
  high- (HR) and low-responders (LR). For (A) untreated control and (B) drug combination-treated
  HGSC datasets at day 14, supervised models (PLS-DA: partial least-squares discriminant
  analysis; sPLS-DA: sparse PLS-DA; RF: random forests) revealed (i) consistent top
  metabolic features discriminating HR from LR and (ii) respective metabolite classes.
  (iii) Pathway analysis of HR vs. LR shows significantly altered pathways for fatty
  acids metabolism (1, 2), amino acids metabolism (3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9) and pyrimidine
  metabolism (5) pathways. A list of metabolites and respective classes, as well as
  altered pathways and respective metabolites, are included in , (color scale and
  symbol size reflect the combination between the p-value and the pathway impact,
  respectively).'
