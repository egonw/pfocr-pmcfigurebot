caption: 'miR‐20a promotes in vitro cisplatin resistance and proliferation in non‐small‐cell
  lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. (A) Levels of miR‐20a expression were assessed in HCC827
  and H1299 cells following miR‐20a mimic transfection, miR‐NC mock transfection or
  control treatment. The viability (B and C) and DDP IC50 values (D) for NSCLC cell
  lines treated as in (A) were measured. The proliferation (E and F), colony formation
  (G and H) and Hoechst staining (I and J) results for NSCLC cell lines treated as
  in (A). (K and L) Western blotting was used to assess PI3K‐p85, PI3K‐p100, PI3K,
  pAKT and AKT expression in the indicated cell lines in the presence or absence of
  DDP treatment, with GAPDH as a normalization control. Outcomes are means ± standard
  deviation (SD) (*p < .05, **p < .01, ***p < .001 vs. control; ##p < .01, ###p < .001 vs.
  mock + DDP)'
