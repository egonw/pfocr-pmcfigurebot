caption: Pathway of Gg3Cer and GalNAc-GM1b glycosphingolipid synthesis in MDA-MB-231
  cells. The designation of the glycosphingolipids and their core structures follow
  the IUPAC-IUB recommendations []. Only transferases B4GALNT1, B4GALT5 and ST3GAL2,
  which are among the most consistently malignancy-associated enzymes [], are marked
  at corresponding steps of synthesis. The relative concentrations of the metabolites.
