figure_title: NCL regulates endothelial metabolism and alters metabolite profiles
  in human brain endothelial cells
caption: (A–F) Metabolite profile comparison between siRNA NCL-knockdown HCMECs and
  control knockdown HCMECs (n = 5). Heatmap and hierarchical clustering showing 2,000
  differentially regulated metabolites (A). Scatter plot showing the significantly
  regulated metabolites upon NCL KD. In total, 455 metabolites were significantly
  upregulated in HCMECsNCLKD (indicated in red) and 292 metabolites were significantly
  downregulated (indicated in blue) (B). Two-dimensional and 3-dimensional PCA plot
  of log-transformed normalized concentration of 2,000 metabolites; each represent
  a sample and are colored by experimental group (C and D). Gene set enrichment analysis
  (GSEA) indicated a significant regulation of various metabolic pathway in HCMECs
  upon Nucleolin knockdown (E). Relative abundance of glycolysis intermediates showed
  an upregulation of both Glucose-6-Phoshpate (G6P) and Fructose-6-Phosphate (F6P),
  and a significant downregulation of Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P), Phosphoenolpyruvate
  (PEP), and lactate (Lac) (F, n = 5). Levels of Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (F16P),
  Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), and 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) and the ratio of
  NADH/NAD+ were not significantly regulated (F, n = 5). Data represent mean ± SEM.
  Two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test were performed. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P
  < 0.001.
