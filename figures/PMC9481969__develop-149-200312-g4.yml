caption: 'Regions of high occupancy Wnt and Fzd expression. (A) Regions of high occupancy
  of Wnt gene expression (magenta) at E9.5, E10.5 and E11.5. (B) Transverse section
  through an OPT reference model of an E11.5 embryo in the mid-flank region showing
  the distribution of occupancy of Wnt expression as indicated. This section reveals
  three ROHOs. (C) Same section as in B, showing the mapped expression of individual
  Wnt genes as indicated. For clarity, left (a) and right (b) halves of the section
  are shown with the expression of Wnt3, 4, 8b, 9b, 10a, 10b (a) and Wnt1, 2, 2b,
  3a, 5a, 5b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 9a, 11, 16 (b). (D) A section through an OPT reference
  model of an E10.5 embryo in the mandibular region. Regions of high occupancy of
  Wnt expression (red; four or more Wnts expressed) and individual Wnt gene expression
  domains are shown for Wnt3, 4, 7a, 7b, 10a and 10b (key as in C). (E) Transverse
  section through an OPT reference model of an E11.5 embryo in the mid-flank region
  showing Fzd ROHOs (key as indicated) in the context of Wnt ROHOs (key as in B showing
  only 5+ Wnt genes) and expression of Wnt5a and Wnt5b. (F) Transverse section through
  an OPT reference model of an E11.5 embryo in the mandibular region showing Wnt and
  Fzd ROHOs (key as in E). (G) The same section as in F, showing only the peaks of
  Wnt and Fzd occupancy (Wnt occupancy of seven or more; Fzd occupancy of six or more.
  (H-J) Sections through the mandibular region in OPT reference models of embryos
  at E9.5, E10.5 and E11.5, respectively. The images show the canonical pathway read-out
  (Tcf/Lef-GFP RNA) (yellow) in the context of Wnt and Fzd ROHOs (key as in E). (K)
  Section through the mandibular region of an OPT reference model of an E10.5 embryo
  showing Fzd ROHOs compared with where no Fzds are detected (as indicated). (L) The
  same section as in K showing the expression of individual Fzds genes as indicated
  (the section is repeated for clarity). (M) The same section as in K showing Sfrp
  occupancy of 0, 3 and 4 (as indicated) in the context of Wnt ROHOs (key as in E)
  and canonical pathway read-out (Tcf/Lef-GFP) in yellow. (N) The same key as M on
  a section through the maxillary and mandibular region of an OPT reference model
  of an E11.5 embryo. Scale bars: 500 µm.'
