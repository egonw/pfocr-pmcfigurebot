caption: 'Hypothetical model illustrating the function of Adam10 in the mouse incisor(A,
  A′) Schematic representation of wild-type (A) and K14Cre/+;Adam10fl/fl (A′) incisors
  showing the absence of stratum intermedium and the deposition of a dysfunctional
  enamel upon Adam10 deletion. Red dashed boxes indicate the areas where stratum intermedium
  cell fate change starts and the stratum intermedium cells adopt the preameloblast
  and stellate reticulum cell fates in the K14Cre/+;Adam10fl/fl incisors (A′).(B,
  B′) Schematic representation of the mechanism of Adam10 action in the dental epithelium.
  Adam10 is responsible for the cleavage of Notch1 in stratum intermedium cells (red
  scissors) that enables nuclear translocation of the Notch1 intracellular domain
  (B; Notch1i, in green). Depletion of Adam10 in the incisor epithelium disables nuclear
  translocation of the Notch1 intracellular domain, thus deregulating the function
  of the Notch pathway. This initiates conversion of a portion of stratum intermedium
  cells into preameloblasts and consequent ameloblast disorganization and impaired
  enamel formation. In addition, another portion of stratum intermedium cells flattens
  and becomes stellate reticulum cells participating in the formation of the incisor’s
  papillary cell layer.(C, C′) Cartoon depicting the definitive alterations in the
  number and composition of the epithelial cell layers (each of them represented by
  a specific color) and enamel formation in the K14Cre/+;Adam10fl/fl incisors. Stratum
  intermedium (orange color) cell fate change toward the stellate reticulum and preameloblast/ameloblast
  fate generates the additional stratum intermedium-derived stellate reticulum (enhanced
  brown color) and stratum intermedium-derived ameloblasts (enhanced violet color)
  and leads to defective enamel deposition. Abbreviations: am, ameloblasts; Ant, anterior
  part; cl, cervical loop; de, dental epithelium; den, dysfunctional enamel; e, enamel;

  Notch1; oee, outer enamel epithelium; pa, preameloblasts; Post, posterior part;
