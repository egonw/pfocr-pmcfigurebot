caption: The differential metabolites and functional analysis of metabolome in colon
  of weanling piglets between CONT and MAG group. PCA (A) and OPLS-DA (B) score plots
  were used to compare the changes in the metabolic profile after magnolol treatment.
  (C) Volcano Plot of different metabolites. (D) Heat-map of the differential metabolites
  between CONT and MAG group. (E) KEGG pathway analysis of differential metabolites
  in weanling piglets by maternal magnolol treatment. n = 6 per group.
article_title: Maternal Magnolol Supplementation during Pregnancy and Lactation Promotes
  Antioxidant Capacity, Improves Gut Health, and Alters Gut Microbiota and Metabolites
  of Weanling Piglets.
