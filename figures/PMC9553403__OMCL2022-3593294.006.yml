caption: 'MSCs-Exo inhibit hippocampus ferroptosis in dNCR mice. The mice were randomly
  divided into 4 groups: Sham group, dNCR group, dNCR+MSCs-Exo group, and dNCR+Fer-1
  group. (a) TEM was employed to detect the ultrastructure of hippocampus in aged
  mice (bar = 1.0 μm). (b, c) ROS (red fluorescent signal) were detected using DHE
  staining (bar = 100 μm). (d) The GSH level by GSH Colorimetric Assay Kit. (e) The
  MDA level by MDA Colorimetric Assay Kit. (f) The Fe2+ level by Ferrous Iron Colorimetric
  Assay Kit. (g–j) GPX4, P53, and SLC7A11 expressions in each group were determined
  by Western blot. gprot: gram protein; mgprot: milligram protein. Data are expressed
  as mean ± SEM (n = 5/group). ∗∗P < 0.01 and ∗∗∗P < 0.001, Sham vs. dNCR; ##P < 0.01,
  dNCR vs. dNCR+ MSCs-Exo; @@P < 0.01, dNCR vs. dNCR+Fer-1. Fer-1: ferrostatin-1,
  a ferroptosis inhibitor.'
