caption: 'Periplocymarin (PM) inhibited AngⅡ‐induced nuclear translocation of STAT3.
  (A) H9c2 cells were preincubated with PM (12.5, 25, 50 μM) and 25 μM S3I for 3 h,
  then exposed to 1 μM AngⅡ for 12 h. The expression of p‐STAT3 (Tyr705) in nuclear
  fraction and cytoplasmic fraction was detected by Western blot. (B) The subcellular
  localization of STAT3 was visualized by immunofluorescence assay. Bars: 50 μm. #p < 0.05,
  ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001 vs. control group. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 vs. AngⅡ group.
  Data were presented as the mean ± SD, n = 3'
