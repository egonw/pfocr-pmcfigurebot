caption: 'U‐II/palosuran mediate PI3K/protein kinase B (AKT)/the mammalian target
  of rapamycin (mTOR) and ubiquitin‐proteasome pathway regulating skeletal muscle.
  (A and B) After 48‐h U‐II treatments on C2C12 myotubes, the Western Blot results
  of myotubes. C‐F, C57/BL/6 male mice were administered 7‐d Dex followed by 14‐d
  palosuran treatments. (C and D) Proteins in PI3K signaling pathway in gastrocnemius.
  (E and F) Protein degradation‐related proteins in gastrocnemius. (G) Proposed signaling
  mechanisms. Means ± standard error of mean (SEM). n = 3 (A and B) or n = 6 (C–F).
  p values less than: .05 (#), .01 (##), .001 (###) compared with normal control (NC);
  .05 (*), .01 (**), .001 (***) compared with Dex group'
