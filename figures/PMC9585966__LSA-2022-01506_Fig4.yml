figure_title: DD-miRNAs affect metabolic pathways in the skeletal muscle
caption: (A) Venn diagram of significantly down-regulated genes in mdx/WT, of miRs/Emp
  transcriptome and of DD-miRNAs’s predicted target genes. (A, B) Pathway analysis
  of the 269 predicted targets for DD-miRNAs identified in (A). (C, D) Validation
  at RNA (C) and protein (D) levels of selected predicted targets (n = 4). (E) Bnip3
  is a predicted target of miR-411-5p. Data in (C) and (D) are presented as mean ±
  SEM. Statistics were performed with t test. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
