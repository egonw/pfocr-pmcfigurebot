caption: Proposed model of TMZ resistance mechanisms that can be overcome by co-treatment
  with NRH and PARGi. (A) TMZ generates multiple DNA lesions, including O6-methylguanine
  (O6-MeG, ~9%), N7-methylguanine (N7-MeG, >70%), and N3-methyladenine (N3-MeA, ~10%);
  (B) The O6-MeG DNA lesion can be directly repaired by MGMT leading to TMZ resistance.
  If the O6-MeG/T mis-pair is acted upon by proteins of the MMR pathway, this leads
  to cell death. However, when the MMR pathway is defective, due to loss of expression
  or mutations in genes of the MMR pathway, then the O6-MeG/T mis-pair is tolerated
  and leads to TMZ resistance. Finally, the N7-MeG or N3-MeA DNA lesions are repaired
  by proteins of the BER pathway; (C) (i) TMZ induces PARP1/PARP2 activation, inducing
  the synthesis of PAR; (ii) NRH increases NAD+, which enhances PARP1/PARP2 activation
  and promotes an increase in PAR formation; (iii) Inhibition of PARG blocks degradation
  of PAR; (iv) Co-treatment of TMZ, NRH, and PARGi results in the hyperaccumulation
  of PAR, trapping DNA repair factors and leading to an increase in unrepaired DNA
  damage, a decrease in cell survival signaling, and an increase in cell death signaling.
