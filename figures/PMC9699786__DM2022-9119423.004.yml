caption: TP inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion, and SPTLC2 mRNA and
  protein expression in HepG2 cells. (a) A CCK-8 assay was used to determine HepG2
  cell proliferation after treatment with TP (0, 1, 2, or 4 μM) and DMSO (negative
  control) for 24 and 48 h. After treating HepG2 cells with TP (0, 1, 2, or 4 μM)
  and DMSO (negative control) for 24 h, the migration (b), invasion (c), and SPTLC2
  mRNA (d) and protein (e) expression of HepG2 cells were measured. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P
  < 0.01 versus the control group.
