caption: Putative key signaling pathways associated with resistance to VPAHPND involved
  in L. vannamei. This represents the cellular process of gill cells at 0 and 6 h
  post-infection. The upregulated genes in the susceptible or resistant family are
  shown in blue or red font, respectively. INSR, insulin-like peptide receptor; EGFR,
  epidermal growth factor receptor; LARS, leucine-tRNA ligase; PRR, pattern recognition
  receptor; AMP, antimicrobial peptide.

  to mTORC1 signaling pathway associated with the resistance trait of shrimp to VPAHPND
