caption: 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 7 (HTR7) promotes laryngeal cancer growth. (A)
  Soft agar growth analysis of the effect of HTR7 overexpression or knockdown on cell
  growth. The colony size was determined using an ocular micrometer and colonies >0.1
  mm in diameter were counted through a bright-field microscope under ×400 magnification.
  Representational soft agar growth assay is shown on the left; statistical analysis
  is shown on the right. (B) Animal model analysis of the effect of HTR7 overexpression
  or knockdown on cell growth. Representational soft agar growth assay is shown on
  the left; tumor volume analysis is shown on the right. Error bars represent the
  mean ± STDEV. *P<0.05.
