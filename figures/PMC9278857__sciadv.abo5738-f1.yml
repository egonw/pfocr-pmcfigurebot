figure_title: Biosynthesis and incorporation of scopoletin into the lignin polymer
caption: Feruloyl-CoA is biosynthesized via the phenylpropanoid pathway. F6′H1, FERULOYL-CoA
  6′-HYDROXYLASE 1; COSY, COUMARIN SYNTHASE. It is hypothesized that, because of the
  presence of a conjugated carbonyl in the scopoletin monomer, the 8-O-4 bond between
  scopoletin and the A unit in the engineered lignin polymer becomes easier to cleave
  under alkaline conditions whether or not the 8-position is substituted. The red
  arrow indicates the bond with increased reactivity. Note that alkaline conditions
  will also hydrolyze the cyclic ester (lactone), thereby cleaving the bond indicated
  with an asterisk (*) and resulting in increased hydrophilicity and thus in a polymer
  that is easier to extract into aqueous solvents. Note that because scopoletin is
  shown as a lignin monomer, its numbering follows standard lignin conventions rather
  than formal coumarin numbering.
