caption: 'KMT2D in PPARγ transcriptome-induced changes in PCa. (A) PC-3 cells were
  treated with ROSI (10 µM) for 24 h and detected by ORO staining. The results showed
  that ROSI could not effectively activate the PPARγ pathway to increase lipid content
  after KMT2D knockdown. (B) The expression of PPARγ mRNA in PC3 cells with/without
  KMT2D knockdown after drug treatment (10 µM ROSI for 24 h). (C) After drug treatment,
  the transcript levels of ACC, ACLY, and FASN were detected in PC-3 cells. The results
  showed that after KMT2D knockdown, none of these genes that ROSI could make them
  exceed the transcript level before KMT2D knockdown. (D) After drug treatment, The
  ProteinSimple analysis (also known as western immunoassay, Wes) was used to analyze
  the protein expression levels of PPARγ, ACC, ACLY, and FASN in PC-3. The results
  showed that after KMT2D knockdown, ROSI could not make ACC and ACLY exceed the level
  before KMT2D knockdown. (E) Detection of the effect of ROSI on the proliferation
  of PC-3 cells (with/without KMT2D knockdown). (F) Detection of the effect of ROSI
  on the migratory capacity of PC-3 cells (with/without KMT2D knockdown). The experiments
  were repeated thrice with biological replicates. Errors are expressed as standard
  deviation (SD). *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001 vs. the control group.
  ##P<0.01 refers to the “PK-ROSI” vs. “PK-DMSO” group. KMT2D, kinase tethers histone-lysine
  N-methyltransferase 2D; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma;
  PCa, prostate cancer; ROSI, rosiglitazone (a PPARγ pathway agonist); ACC, acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase; ACLY, ATP citrate lyase; FASN, fatty acid synthase; ORO, Oil red O;
  PN, PC-3 control group; PK, PC-3 KMT2D-knockdown group; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide;
  CCK-8, cell counting kit-8; NS, not significant (P>0.05).'
