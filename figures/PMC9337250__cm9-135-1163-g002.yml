caption: 'Bile acid synthesis and enterohepatic circulation. Bile acids are exclusively
  synthesized from cholesterol in the hepatocytes via two pathways, classical (neutral)
  pathway and alternative (acidic pathway) via multiple enzymatic reactions. Under
  normal physiological conditions, bile acids circulate from the liver to the bile,
  intestinal lumen, and return to the liver via the portal vein. More than 95% of
  bile acids are reabsorbed by the enterocytes in the ileum, and only 5% will be metabolized
  by the gut microbiome and excreted via feces. The lost bile acids will be replaced
  by de-novo synthesis in the liver. The composition of the bile acid pool in mice
  is different from that in humans. Α-MCA: α-muricholic acid; BACS: Bile acyl-CoA
  synthetase; BAAT: Bile acid-CoA: amino acid N-acyltransferase; β-MCA: Beta-Muricholic
  acid; CA: Cholic acid; CDCA: Chenodeoxycholic acid; CYP27A1: Cholesterol 27α-hydroxylase;
  DCA: Deoxycholic acid; GCA: Glycocholic acid; GCDCA: Glycine chenodeoxycholic acid;
  LCA: Lithocholic acid; MDCA: Murideoxycholic acid; TCA: Taurocholic acid; TCDCA:
  Taurine chenodeoxycholic acid. The figure was created via BioRenders.com.'
