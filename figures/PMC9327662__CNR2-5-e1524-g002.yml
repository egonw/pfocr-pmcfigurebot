caption: 'Serum proteins associated with time to progression. (A) Pathway analysis
  of the top 20 serum proteins differentially modulated (δC4) comparing patients with
  early and late progression. The identified proteins are broadly associated with
  interleukin signaling (red), complement cascade (blue) or in signal transduction
  (yellow). (B) Volcano plot identifying BTK to be significantly (p‐value cutoff = .05)
  overexpressed (comparing on‐ and pre‐treatment samples) in patients with early progression.
  (C) Heatmap of the top 20 serum proteins sorted in accordance with decreasing p‐value.
  The heatmap shows the formation of two major clusters based on the protein expression
  profile of the velocity of change. Various clinical parameters including mutational
  status, progression and survival have been mapped to the cluster distribution. δC4 < 0
  indicates higher expression and δC4 > 0 indicates lower expression in the on‐treatment
  samples in comparison to the pre‐treatment samples. *Represents protein identified
  by second antibody clone. #C4/C5 represents complement component 4/5, respectively'
