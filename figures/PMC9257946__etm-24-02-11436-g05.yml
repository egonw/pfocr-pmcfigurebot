caption: 'Effect of TUDCA on the UPR signaling pathway in DRG neurons. (A) Protein
  expression levels of p-PERK, t-PERK, p-eIF2α, t-eIF2α, IRE1α and ATF6 in DRG neurons
  following TUN and TUDCA treatment were evaluated by western blotting. Bar charts
  show the ratio of (B) p-PERK, (C) t-PERK, (D) p-eIF2α, (E) t-eIF2α, (F) IRE1α and
  (G) ATF6, as determined by densitometry. GAPDH was used as an internal reference;
  p-PERK levels were normalized to t-PERK levels and p-eIF2α levels were normalized
  to t-PERK levels. The control group was set at 100%. Data were obtained from three
  independent experiments and are expressed as the mean ± SEM. **P<0.01, ***P<0.001
  vs. control group; #P<0.05 and ##P<0.01 vs. TUN group. DRG, dorsal root ganglion;
  TUDCA, tauroursodeoxycholic acid; TUN, tunicamycin; PERK, protein kinase R-like
  ER kinase; p, phosphorylated; t, total.'

  ganglion neurons by suppressing activation of ER stress.
