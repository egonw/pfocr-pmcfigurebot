figure_title: Hemoprotein-dependent oxidation of H2S with thiosulfate and inorganic
  polysulfide as end products
caption: Many molecules of H2S can bind to Fe3+ ion in heme (MetHb) forming persulfide
  or polysulfide chain. The persulfide can be oxidized in the presence of oxygen to
  thiosulfate. This pathway of H2S oxidation is important in erythrocytes that do
  not have mitochondria.
