caption: Signaling pathways activated or inhibited by CNP in the bone growth plate
  region. The cellular effects of CNP action are mediated through the NPR-B receptor,
  stimulating intracellular molecule cGMP production, which further results in the
  protein kinase G (PKG) activation. PGK activation by CNP results in the MAPK signaling
  pathway, which results in chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation. NPR-C receptor
  degrades CNP; additionally, Gi protein of the receptor modulates the level of ERK1/2
  inside the cell. ?- it is not confirmed if CREB is activated by PKG.
