caption: 9r reduced ROS production in H2O2-treated SH-SY5Y cells. (A) Cells were exposed
  to 9r and subjected to DCFH-DA probe. Cells were treated immediately using inverted
  fluorescence microscopy. (B,C) Changes in ROS production were assessed using flow
  cytometry after incubation with DCFH-DA fluorogenic dye. The results are shown as
  the mean ± SD of three independent tests. compared to the control group, *** p <
  0.001. Compared to the H2O2−treated group, &p < 0.05.
