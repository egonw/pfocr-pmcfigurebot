caption: IF1-mediated ROS signaling in nuclear reprogramming and tumor development.
  Metabolic reprogramming from OXPHOS to aerobic glycolysis through IF1-mediated inhibition
  of ATP synthase; this process induces mild ROS that activate NF-κB pathway and Bcl-xl,
  preventing apoptosis. Bcl-xl, B cell lymphoma-extra large; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB;
  OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation; ROS, reactive oxygen species. Color images are
  available online.
