caption: The functional and pathway enrichment analysis of 61 differentially expressed
  ferroptosis-related genes. (A) The top 20 enriched ontology clusters. The abscissa
  represents the significant P value of enrichment. The color represents the P value,
  and darker colors indicate smaller P values. (B) Network of functional and pathway
  enrichment terms. Each node represents an enriched term and is colored by its cluster
  ID. Those nodes that share the same cluster ID are generally close to each other.
