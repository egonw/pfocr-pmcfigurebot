figure_title: Cleaved BPI protein is present in the bronchoalveolar lavage samples
  of CF patients that carry anti-BPI IgA
caption: '(A) Representative immunoblots demonstrating presence of full length (~64
  kDa band) or cleaved (~26kDa band) BPI in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples of
  CF patients (4ug BAL protein lanes 1–6, 10ug BAL protein lanes 7–13). Recombinant
  BPI (0.5ug) was used as a positive control. IgA/IgG reactivity to P. aeruginosa
  and BPI were measured in the corresponding BAL samples by ELISA and denoted below
  each lane as positive (+) or negative (–). Sample #8 shows very low positive titer
  for anti-BPI IgG. (B) Proposed model of breaking of immune tolerance to BPI in the
  presence of chronic P. aeruginosa airway infection (high anti-P. aeruginosa IgA
  titers) through mucosal immune response exposure to cryptic epitope(s) via BPI cleavage
  in the CF airway and IgA specific autoantibody response. Systemic immune response
  to both P. aeruginosa and self-BPI antigen occurs through a separate pathway and
  is present in serum.'
