figure_title: PDLS transcriptome compared to MCL-2D
caption: A Volcano plot representing the differentially expressed genes (DEG) between
  MCL-PDLS after 7 days of culture to 2D-MCL culture with monocytes and cytokines.
  DEG were obtained by a paired (n = 4) DESeq2 analysis (FDR < 0.1 and absolute log2FC > 0.5).
  B Heatmap of DEG for the individual patients (n = 4). C Percentage of genes described
  in each pathway (as in Fig. ) [, ] which are upregulated in the PDLS or in MCL-2D.
  D GSEA plots representing significantly enriched pathways (FDR < 0.05) in the PDLS
  compared to 2D-MCL. E Heatmaps of leading genes of the indicated gene sets in (D).
article_title: A novel patient-derived 3D model recapitulates mantle cell lymphoma
  lymph node signaling, immune profile and in vivo ibrutinib responses.
