caption: Biomarker‐containing pathways are relatively inherited metabolic disorder
  (IMD) specific. (A) The counts of biomarker‐containing and non‐biomarker‐containing
  pathways across 64 samples were plotted by the number of IMDs that share enrichment
  of each pathway. Biomarker‐containing pathways are significantly more IMD‐specific
  overall than non‐biomarker‐containing pathways (Wilcoxon p = 0.016). We indicate
  a set of pathways enriched by common non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
  taken by a subset of our cohort with asterisk symbol (Table ). If we remove these
  confounding pathways, biomarker‐containing pathways are not significantly more IMD
  specific (Wilcoxon p = 0.13)
article_title: Application of metabolite set enrichment analysis on untargeted metabolomics
  data prioritises relevant pathways and detects novel biomarkers for inherited metabolic
  disorders.
