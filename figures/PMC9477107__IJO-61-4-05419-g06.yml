caption: Protein complex LIS1/CLIP170 regulates SACC-LM cell migration and invasion
  through the Cdc42 signaling pathway. Tumor cells were transfected with vector or
  LIS1 and then transfected with si-control or si-CLIP170, and ML141, as an inhibitor
  of Cdc42, was added into SACC-LM cells. (A) Wound healing assays were performed
  to assess the horizontal migration ability of SACC-LM cells. Scale bar, 500 µm.
  (B) Quantitative statistical analysis of the wound healing assay results. (C) The
  chemotactic migration and Matrigel invasion of SACC-LM cells were measured using
  Transwell assays. Scale bar, 100 µm. (D) Quantitative analysis of the migrated cells
  at 12 h and the cells that invaded through the Matrigel membrane at 24 h. (E) Invadopodia
  formation in SACC-LM cells was detected by IF double staining. The merged images
  (yellow) show the colocalization of cortactin (green) and F-actin (red). Scale bar,
  25 µm. (F) Quantitative statistics of the area of invadopodia per cell determined
  by the colocalization of cortactin and F-actin. (G) MMP2, MMP9, and MMP14 protein
  levels in SACC-LM cells were measured via western blotting. (H) Quantitative analysis
  of MMP protein levels. Mean ± SEM; *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001. LIS1, lissencephaly
  1; CLIP170, cytoplasmic linker protein 170; SACC, salivary gland adenoid cystic
  carcinoma; Cdc42, cell division control protein 42 homolog; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase;
  si-, small interfering RNA; ns, not significant.
