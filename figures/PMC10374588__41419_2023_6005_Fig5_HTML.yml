figure_title: Regulation role of pyroptosis in renal inflammation and fibrosis
caption: Inflammatory factors, bacteria, viruses, toxic metabolic injuries, and other
  exogenous and endogenous danger signals can induce the initiation of renal inflammation
  and fibrosis. In this process, renal resident cells and macrophages activate the
  NF-κB pathway when they recognize DAMPs or PAMPs, which results in the production
  of pro-IL-1β/18. Subsequently, the activated NLRP3 inflammasome induces pro-caspase-1
  autocleavage, and activated caspase-1 cleaves GSDMD to produce GSDMD-NT, which Induces
  the formation of holes in the plasma membrane. The release of inflammatory cytokines
  such as IL-1β, IL-18, and TNF-α stimulates the secretion of TGF-1β and increases
  the expression of the TGF-β receptor. Meanwhile, fibrotic factors such as TGF-1β
  accelerate the trans-differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts in the renal
  stromal region. Myofibroblast activation leads to excessive deposition of ECM, such
  as α-SMA and collegen, ultimately resulting in renal fibrosis.
