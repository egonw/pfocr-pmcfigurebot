caption: Interaction network of HP proteins. A Interaction network of HP proteins
  families in Arabidopsis. The red letters represent HP proteins signaling pathway.
  B Interaction network of GhHPs proteins with other proteins. The black and red letters
  represent AtHP proteins and cotton HP proteins, respectively. C Interaction network
  of GhRR27 proteins with other proteins. The black and red letters represent AtHP
  proteins and GhHP27 proteins, respectively. D Interaction network of GhHP23 proteins
  with other proteins. Black letters represent AtHP protein. Red letters represent
  GhHP23 protein, respectively
