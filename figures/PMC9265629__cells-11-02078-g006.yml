caption: The AXL inhibitor R428 reversed erlotinib resistance and colony formation
  induced by integrin β3 in NSCLC cells. (A,B) CCK8 assay showing the effects of R428
  on cell viability in ectopic integrin β3-expressing (+β3) HCC827 (A) and HCC4006
  (B) cells upon treatment with different concentrations of erlotinib. * represents
  +β3 +R428 vs. +Ctrl +R428 or +β3 +Vehicle. (C,D) Colony formation assays showing
  the effects of R428 on colony formation in ectopic integrin β3-expressing (+β3)
  HCC827 (C) and HCC4006 (D) cells. (A,B,D) Data represent the means ± SEM. (A–D)
  n = 3 independent experiments. * p < 0.05.
