figure_title: The cytotoxicity of 6-(methylsulfinyl) hexyl isothiocyanate (6-MSITC)
  in HepG2 cells
caption: The cells (3 × 104 cells/100 μL) were grown for 24 hours, and then exposed
  to the indicated concentrations of 6-MSITC for 12, 24, or 48 hours. The cells density
  was assessed calorimetrically after staining with MTT. The values are means ± standard
  deviation of eight data. *P < 0.05 vs. control.
