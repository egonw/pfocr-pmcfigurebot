caption: '(A) Representative western blot of indicted proteins from sham and IA of
  WT and Cilp1 KO hearts at post-MI day 3. Quantifications were shown on the right
  panel (n=4). (B) Representative immunofluorescent micrographs of WT and Cilp1 KO
  heart in the IA at post-MI day 3 co-stained with pS6 and αSMA. (C-E) NRV cFbs were
  cultured in the presence of recombinant CILP1 protein, or with condition medium
  from control vector, NCilp1, and NCilp1/ΔSS transfected cells, and treated with
  or without mTOR inhibitor rapamycin or MAPK inhibitor PD98059. (C) Western blot
  of cell lysates with antibodies against markers of the mTORC1 pathway (pS6), Akt
  pathway (pAkt), MAPK pathway (pErk), and respective loading controls. (D) NRV cFbs
  under indicated culture conditions were pulsed labeled with puromycin (1nM) for
  15 min. Cell lysates were western blotted with antibody against puromycin (left
  panel) and quantified with densitometry (right panel). (E) NRV cFbs under indicated
  culture conditions were pulse-labeled with BrdU (10 μM) for 30min. Representative
  immunofluorescent images of cells co-stained with BrdU (red) and DAPI (blue). Quantification
  of % BrdU labeled cells are shown on the right panel. BrdU+-cells are normalized
  to the total DAPI-stained nucleus in the field. (F-G) Relative fold change of mRNA
  (F) and % BrdU labeled nuclei (G) of NRV cFbs transfected with control or Cilp1
  siRNA. Longer BrdU labeling time (50 min) were used in (G). (H) % BrdU-labeled cells
  in adult cFbs treated with vehicle or recombinant CILP1 protein. (I) Relative mRNA
  of adult cFbs transfected with control or Cilp1 siRNA. Error bars are SEM. (A, E,
  F-I) * p< 0.05 by student t test. D, Mann-Whitney test. ns: not significant.'
