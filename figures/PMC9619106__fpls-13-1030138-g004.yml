caption: Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of salt stress-responsive
  genes in the DM plantlets under salt stress. (A) Hierarchical cluster tree of the
  common genes between different studies. The branches and color bands represent the
  assigned modules; the tips of the branches represent genes. (B) The heat map shows
  the Topological Overlap Matrix (TOM) value among the proteins of the network delimited
  into modules by the dynamic method. Lower TOM is indicated by the yellow color and
  higher TOM is indicated by the progressively red color. (C) The thermogram showed
  the correlations between the modules and the contents of proline and malondialdehyde.
  No significant correlations are displayed in white, positive correlations and negative
  correlations are displayed in red and blue, respectively. PRO, proline; MDA, malondialdehyde
  (the same below).
