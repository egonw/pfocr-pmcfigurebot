caption: 'The role played by CX3CL1 derived from BMSCs in Aβ1-42-induced SH-SY5Y was
  related to TXNIP/NLRP3 axis. (a–d) MDA, SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px concentrations measured
  by commercial kits. (e–h) Western blotting tested TXNIP, NLRP3, and Trx protein
  levels relative to β-actin. ∗p < 0.05 versus control group; #p < 0.05 versus Aβ
  group; &p < 0.05 versus Aβ+MSC group.'
