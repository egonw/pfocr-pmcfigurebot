caption: 'Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of ethanol extracts from dried
  Chrysanthemum zawadskii. (a) Extraction yield of dried Chrysanthemum zawadskii (CZ)
  and (b) antioxidant activity was determined using the DPPH assay (top panel) or
  the ABTS assay (bottom panel). The indicated concentration of water (left panel)
  or ethanol extract (right panel) from dried CZ was mixed with assay buffer, and
  the free radical-scavenging ability was analyzed as described in the Materials and
  Methods. (c) RAW 264.7 cells were treated with the indicated amount of the extract
  with or without 0.1 μg/ml of LPS for 24 h. The mRNA levels of iNOS, COX-2, and IL-6
  were analyzed using RT-PCR. β-Actin was detected as a control. (d) RAW 264.7 cells
  were incubated with the extract (100 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of 0.1 μg/ml
  of LPS for 24 h. Intracellular ROS levels were measured by DCA-DA assay. (e) RAW
  264.7 cells were treated with the indicated amount of extract for the indicated
  period. The MTT assay was performed, and the results are presented as the percentage
  of untreated control. Data were represented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). ∗P
  < 0.05 vs. control. #P < 0.05 vs. LPS treatment.'
