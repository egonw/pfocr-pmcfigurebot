caption: Percentages of patients with increased glomerular and tubular injury in DK
  patients. ACR, albumin creatinine ratio; uβ2-MG, urine β2-microglobulin; uGAL, urine
  β-galactosidase; uIgG, urine Immunoglobulin G; uTF, urine Transferrin; uNAG, urine
  N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase; uRBP, urine retinol-binding protein; NC, normal control;
  NDK, non-diabetic ketosis; DK, diabetic ketosis. ACR≥30mg/g was defined as (+),
  c2 = 45.446, p < 0.001 between NC,NDK, and DK groups, c2 = 3.107, p = 0.07 between
  before and after ketosis control; urine β2-MG≥0.3mg/l was defined as (+), c2 = 14.960,
  p = 0.001 between NC, NDK, and DK groups, c2 = 2.320, p = 0.128 compared before
  and after ketosis control; urine GAL≥15U/l was recorded as (+), c2 = 25.505, p <
  0.001, between NC, NDK, and DK groups, c2 = 6.444, p = 0.01 between before and after
  ketosis control; urine IgG≥17.5mg/l was recorded as (+), c2 = 6.451, p = 0.04 between
  NC,NDK and DK groups, c2 = 2.071, p = 0.15 between before and after ketosis control;
  urine NAG≥12U/l was recorded as (+), c2 = 14.004, p = 0.001 between NC,NDK and DK
  groups, c2 = 6.692, p = 0.01 between before and after ketosis control; urine RBP≥0.7mg/l
  was recorded as (+), c2 = 18.187, p < 0.001 between NC, NDK, and DK groups, c2 =
  2.974, p = 0.08 between before and after ketosis control; urine TF≥5mg/l was recorded
  as (+), c2 = 18.975, p < 0.001 between NC,NDK and DK groups, c2 = 1.970, p = 0.16
  between before and after ketosis control.
