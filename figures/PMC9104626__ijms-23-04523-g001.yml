caption: General metabolic pathway of organophosphate pesticides with the neurotoxic
  mechanism of action. (a) The parent organophosphorothionates bioactivated to highly
  toxic oxon forms by cytochrome P450 through the removal of sulfur attached to phosphorus
  and insertion of the oxygen atom (oxidative desulphuration) using the reactive and
  electrophilic iron–oxo intermediate, detoxified by dearylation to form dialkyl thiophosphates
  (inactive metabolites) or further hydrolyzed to dialkyl phosphates (inactive metabolites)
  by paraoxonase-1 (PON1) and carboxylesterase (CE) in phase I. Furthermore, phase
  II involves conjugative reactions carried out by glutathione transferases (GSTs);
  N-acetyltransferases (NATs); UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGTs); and sulphotransferases
  (SULTs), UDP-glucuronyltransferases (UGT), sulphotransferases (SULT), N-acetyltransferases
  (NAT), glutathione S-transferases (GST); and is excreted out through urine in a
  nontoxic form. (b) The oxon metabolite phosphorylates the hydroxyl group of the
  serine present in the active site of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) causing
  ACh accumulation in the nerve synapsis [].
