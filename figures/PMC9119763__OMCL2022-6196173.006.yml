caption: 'Administration of Fn1 inhibitor increased the AMP/ATP ratio and activated
  LKB1-AMPK signaling in I/R hearts. (a) Immunoblotting analysis of the protein levels
  of p-LKB1 (S428), LKB1, p-AMKP (T172), AS160, GLUT4, Mfn1, Mfn2, (left), p-Drp1
  (S616), and Drp1. GAPDH as an internal control. (b) The quantification of the relative
  protein levels (right, n = 4 per group). (c) Measurement of AMP and ATP contents
  and the ratio of AMP/ATP (n = 5). Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. ∗∗∗P < 0.001;
  ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001 versus the sham-operated group; ##P < 0.01; ###P < 0.001, ####P <
  0.0001 versus saline I/R 24 h; &&P < 0.01; &&&P < 0.001, &&&&P < 0.0001 versus saline
  I/R 72 h.'
