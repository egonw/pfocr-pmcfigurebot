caption: 'Expression, survival, alternation, regulation, pathway analysis of DNMT
  family genes in human cancer and risk score model of DNMT family genes in LIHC.
  (A) Heatmap of differential expression of DNMTs between tumor and normal samples
  in pan-cancer. The color of each box represents the size of logFC value, white box
  represents P value > 0.05, which has no significant difference. (B) Progression
  free survival analysis of DNMTs by Cox univariate regression in pan-cancer samples
  with significance indicated in red (C) Expression of DNMT1 in HEK-293 and HuH-7 cells;
  DNMT3A in HEK-293 and HuH-7 cells, VCaP cells, MDA-MB-231 cells; DNMT3B in HEK-293
  and MDA-MB-231 cells by RT-qPCR. The results from three independent experiments
  were statistically analyzed using t-test method. ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001.
  (D) Overall Survival of DNMTs alternation group and non-alternation group (E) Network
  plot showed microRNAs and transcription factors regulating DNMTs. (F) GSEA enrichment
  of the DNMTs correlated genes in LIHC. Red: NES >0, P < 0.05; blue: NES <0, P < 0.05.
  (G) Overall survival between high riskscore group and low riskscore group. (H) Heatmap
  of relationship between high and low riskscore groups with the expression of EMT
  key genes. (I) Correlation of riskscore and expression of immune cells in LIHC.'
