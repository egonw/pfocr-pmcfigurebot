caption: 'MDA-MB-231-derived EVs carrying miR-887-3p promoted BC cell drug resistance.
  MDA-MB-231-derived EV-treated BC cells were exposed to 0.5 μM doxorubicin, 2.5 μM
  cisplatin, and 0.5 μM fulvestrant, respectively. Then, CCK-8 assay (a), colony formation
  assay (b), and flow cytometry (c) were performed to assess effects of MDA-MB-231-derived
  EVs carrying miR-887-3p on BC cell drug resistance. Data are exhibited as the mean
  ± standard deviation. One-way ANOVA and Tukey''s multiple comparison test were used
  to determine statistical significance. ∗p < 0.05 and∗∗p < 0.01. Three independent
  experiments were performed. BC: breast cancer; miR: microRNA; RT-qPCR: reverse transcription
  quantitative polymerase chain reaction; CCK-8: cell counting kit-8; ANOVA: analysis
  of variance.'
