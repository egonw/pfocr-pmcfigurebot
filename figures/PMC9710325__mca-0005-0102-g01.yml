caption: 'The endocannabinoid system regulates a battery of signaling pathways involved
  in neurological stimulation and growth, inflammation and immune response, control
  of cell fate, growth differentiation, and apoptosis. (1) Cannabinoids interact with
  the CB1 receptor to block voltage sensitive Ca2+ channels and activate K+ channels,
  resulting in neurotransmitter release and effects on learning, locomotion, and memory.
  (2.Aâ€“D) Cannabinoids interact with cannabinoid receptors and modulate several signaling
  pathways that control cell growth, differentiation, survival, and apoptosis. These
  pathways include: (2.A) activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)
  such as the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and the stress-activated
  kinases JUN amino-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK; (2.B) activation of phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K)-a serine/threonine kinase (AKT)-the mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR) survival pathway; (2.C) activation of p42/p44 MAPKs by inhibiting adenylyl
  cyclase (AC) and activating protein kinase C (PKC), which control neuronal growth,
  inflammation, and apoptosis; and (2.D) cannabinoids also promote survival by activating
  AKT by blocking ceramide induced AKT inhibition.'
