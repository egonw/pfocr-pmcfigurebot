caption: Exosomal miR-221-3p inhibited proliferation, migration, and ECM deposition
  in ASMCs by downregulating FGF2. TGF-β1-treated ASMCs were incubated with BMSCs-derived
  exosomes alone or together with transfection with pcDNA-FGF2. (a) The expression
  of FGF2 mRNA was detected by RT-qPCR. (b), (c) The protein expression of FGF2 was
  detected by western blot analysis. (d) CCK-8 assay was performed to evaluate ASMC
  proliferation. (e), (f) Transwell assay was performed to detect ASMC migration.
  (g)-(h) The protein expression of fibronectin and collagen III was analyzed by using
  Western blot analysis. Data from at least three independent experiments were presented
  as mean ± SD ∗P < 0.05.
