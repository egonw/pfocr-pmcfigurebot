caption: The mechanical transduction pathway network plays a role in stiffness‐mediated
  EMT by regulating target genes. The TGFβ family activates downstream pathways through
  the TβR to promote EMT. Through mechanical transduction pathways, ECM stiffness
  activates different downstream molecules and then regulates the activation of EMT‐TF,
  which controls the downstream gene transcription such as upregulating mesenchymal
  markers, elevating cell membrane receptor expression, and downregulating epithelial
  markers. The dotted line indicates that there is a relationship in upregulation,
  but the direct action needs further confirmation.
