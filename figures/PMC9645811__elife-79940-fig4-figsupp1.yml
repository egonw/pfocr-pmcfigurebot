figure_title: FLT3-ITD acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells demonstrate shift of O-propargyl-puromycin
  (OPP)-labeled peaks over the course of drug treatments without showing signs of
  cell death
caption: Cell viability was measured at each time condition prior to OPP assay of
  MOLM-13 cells. Cell density at the start of treatment (2 × 105 cells/mL) is represented
  as a dotted line.
article_title: Therapeutic resistance in acute myeloid leukemia cells is mediated
  by a novel ATM/mTOR pathway regulating oxidative phosphorylation.
