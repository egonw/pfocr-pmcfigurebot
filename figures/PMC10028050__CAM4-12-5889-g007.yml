caption: CKS2 promoted glioma cell aggressiveness by activating the TGFβ/SMAD signaling
  pathway. (A) The dot plot of partially enriched pathway. (B) The dot plot of the
  up‐ and down‐regulated pathways. (C) GSEA enrichment plot showed the upregulated
  pathway of TGFβ/SMAD. (D–G) Western blot detection of TGFβR1, smad2/3, P‐samd2,
  P‐smad3, P‐smad7 in U251 and LN229 cells CKS2‐siRNA or overexpression plasmid treatment.
  (H–K) Western blot detection of smad2/3 expression levels in cytoplasm and nucleus
  of U251 and LN229 cells treated with siRNA or overexpression plasmid. (L–M) Western
  blot assays detected the changes of TGFβ/SMAD pathway in low‐grade glioma (LGG)
  and high‐grade glioma (HGG) tissues.
