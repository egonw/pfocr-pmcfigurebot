figure_title: CircLIFR inhibits HCC cell progression via GSK-3β
caption: 'A, B Colony formation assay showing the effect of GSK-3β and circLIFR on
  cell proliferation in Huh7 and SNU387 cells. C, D Transwell migration assay performed
  to examine the effect of GSK-3β and circLIFR on cell migration in Huh7 and SNU387
  cells. E, F Transwell invasion assay performed to examine the effect of GSK-3β and
  circLIFR on cell invasion in Huh7 and SNU387 cells. Representative images taken
  at a magnification of ×100. Scale bar: 100 μm. Data represent means ± SD of three
  independent experiments. *P < 0.05.'
