  injury
caption: '(a) qPCR of non-wounded Il27p28fl/fl and LysM-cre/Il27p28fl/fl skin injected
  with capsaicin/vehicle. n = 6/group.(b) Overlapping upregulated genes in 12- and
  24-hour old mouse wounds, 2- and 5-day old human wounds, and IL-27-treated human
  keratinocytes.(c) Overlapping genes expressed in 24-hour old mouse wounds and IL-27-treated
  human keratinocytes. Color and magnitude refer to pathway activation z-score.(d)
  qPCR: Wounds treated with IgG/αIL-27 (10μg/mL) at 24 hours. n = 3/group.(e) qPCR:
  OAS2 in wounded human skin organ culture treated with IgG/αIL-27 (10μg/mL) at 24
  hours. n = 3/group organ cultures.(f) qPCR: C57BL/6J and Il27ra−/− mice at 24 hours
  post-wounding. n = 3-4/group.Non-wounded (NW), wounded (W). Data are presented as
  mean ± SEM. Student’s unpaired t test. **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, *****p<0.00001.'
