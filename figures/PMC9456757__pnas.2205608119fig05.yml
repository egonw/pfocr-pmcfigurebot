caption: The CRL4DTL–SETD8 pathway contributes to CSN5i-3 toxicity. (A and B) Repression
  and overexpression of DTL have opposite effects on induction of overreplication
  and apoptosis by CSN5i-3. Unmodified K562 cells (WT) or cells in which either DTL
  or SETD8 was repressed (CRISPRi) or overexpressed (o/e; stable integration of cDNA)
  were treated for 3 (A) or 1 to 4 (B) days with DMSO or 1 µM CSN5i-3. Cell cycle
  stage/DNA content (A) and apoptosis (B) were evaluated by fluorescence-activated
  cell sorting (FACS) as in . Error bars represent ±SD; n = 3. (C) CSN5i-3 blocks
  SETD8 degradation. CHX chase was performed for 0 to 24 h in K562 cells treated with
  or without 1 µM CSN5i-3. Error bars represent ±SD; n = 3. (D) Up-regulation of SETD8
  by CSN5i-3 is not an indirect consequence of G2 arrest. K562 cells were synchronized
  at the G1/S boundary by double thymidine (dT) block and then released in the presence
  of either DMSO or 1 µM CSN5i-3. At the indicated times, samples were withdrawn,
  and cells were assessed by FACS to determine cell cycle stage, or cell lysates were
  prepared and evaluated for content of SETD8 or its reaction product H4K20Me1 by
  immunoblotting. Representative Western blots are shown; n = 3. (E) SETD8 modulates
  cytotoxicity of CSN5i-3. This is the same as in  except that K562 cells in which
  SETD8 was repressed (CRISPRi; BFP+) or overexpressed (o/e; GFP+) were mixed with
  parental K562 cells. SETD8 protein levels in wild-type, repressed, and overexpressed
  cells are shown by Western blot. Error bars represent ±SD; n = 3. (F) SETD8 contributes
  to the CSN5i-3 sensitivity of DTL-deficient cells. This is the same as in  except
  that K562 cells with CRISPRi repression of both DTL and SETD8 (GFP+BFP+) were mixed
  1:1 at time 0 with cells with CRISPRi for only DTL (GFP+). Error bars represent
  ±SD; n = 3. (G) DTL deficiency renders cells sensitive to CSN5i-3 by mechanisms
  in addition to SETD8 accumulation. This is the same as in F except that cells with
  CRISPRi repression of both DTL and SETD8 (GFP+BFP+) were cocultured with CRISPRi
  for only SETD8 (GFP+). Error bars represent ±SD; n = 3. (H) Proposed mechanism of
  CSN5i-3 toxicity through the CRL4DTL–SETD8 axis.
