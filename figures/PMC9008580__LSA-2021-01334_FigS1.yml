  (related to )
caption: (A) Glucose and lactate concentrations in HBEC culture medium after 48 h
  of culture. n = 2 independent experiments, mean ± SEM. (B) Representative FACS analysis
  of apoptosis in HBECs cultured for 48 h with sufficient glucose (10 mM) or limited
  glucose (1, 0.1 and 0 mM). Q1 represents the percentage of necrotic cells, Q2 late-apoptotic
  cells, Q3 early apoptotic cells, and Q4 live cells. (C) mRNA levels of GFPT2 in
  HBECs grown for 48 h under sufficient (10 mM) or limited (0.1 mM) glucose conditions.
  ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01, (unpaired t test, n = 3, mean ± SEM). (D) Schematic representation
  of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway and mannose biosynthetic pathway (MBP). (E)
  mRNA levels of MPI and PMM2 in HBECs grown for 48 h under sufficient (10 mM) or
  limited (1, 0.1 mM) glucose conditions. ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05 (unpaired
  t test, n = 4 independent experiments, mean ± SEM).
