caption: GART-dependent control of ERα stability and cell proliferation in Not-IDC
  and IDC breast cancer cells. Western blot analyses of ERα expression levels in MCF-7
  cells treated with GART siRNA oligonucleotides for 24 hours (A) and with both the
  indicated time points (C) and the indicated doses (D) of lometrexol (LMX) doses
  for 48 hours. Blots are representative images of 4 independent experiments. Densitometric
  and statistical analyses are reported in . Growth curve analyses in MCF-7 cells
  were performed as indicated in the material and method section for 3 days in cells
  treated with GART siRNA oligonucleotides (B) and for 5 days in cells treated with
  the indicated doses of lometrexol (LMX) (E). The graphs show the normalized cell
  index (i.e., cell number), which is detected with the xCelligence DP device and
  calculated at each time point with respect to the control sample. Each sample was
  measured in quadruplicate. For details, please see the material and methods section.
  Western blot analyses of ERα expression levels in ZR-75-1 (F) and HCC1428 (G) cells
  treated at the indicated doses of lometrexol (LMX) doses for 48 hours. Blots are
  representative images of 4 independent experiments. Densitometric and statistical
  analyses are reported in . Growth curve analyses in ZR-75-1 (H) and HCC1428 (I)
  cells were performed as indicated in the material and method section for 5 days
  in cells treated with the indicated doses of lometrexol (LMX). The graphs show the
  normalized cell index (i.e., cell number), which is detected with the xCelligence
  DP device and calculated at each time point with respect to the control sample.
