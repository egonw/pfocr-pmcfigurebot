figure_title: IL-23 derived from Hepa1-6 cells promotes the TNF-α signaling pathway
  and induces MMP9 and ICAM1 expression in LSECs
caption: (A) DEGs in cocultured LSECs were functionally classified according to Molecular
  Signature Database (MSigDB) Hallmark 2020. JAK, Janus kinase; STAT3, signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3. (B) Validation by qRT-PCR of the TNF-α signaling
  pathway–related gene expression in LSECs cocultured with Hepa1-6 cells. (C) Immunoblots
  for TNF-α and IL-23 in media from monocultured LSECs and cocultured LSEC–Hepa1-6
  cells. Ponceau S, loading control. (D) Immunoblots of phosphorylated and total NF-kB
  (pNF-kB and tNF-kB, respectively) in LSECs treated with rmTNF-α (10 ng/ml) in a
  time-dependent manner. (E) qRT-PCR analysis of MMP9 and ICAM1 in LSECs treated with
  rmTNF-α (10 ng/ml) for 24 hours. (F) Cytokine array for soluble factors in combined
  media from monocultured LSECs and Hepa1-6 cells and in medium from cocultured LSECs
  and Hepa1-6 cells. The soluble factors with the biggest change are circled. (G)
  qRT-PCR analysis of IL-23 in Hepa1-6 cells (left) and LSECs (right) under coculture
  conditions. (H) Immunoblots of TNF-α in LSECs treated with rmIL-23 in a dose-dependent
  manner. (I) qRT-PCR analysis of iCAM1 expression in monocultured LSECs and LSECs
  cocultured with Hepa1-6 cells for 24 hours. (J) Representative IF of ICAM1 staining
  in LSECs. Scale bar, 1 μm. (K) Immunoblots of ICAM1 protein in primary mouse LSECs
  transfected with shGFP (control) or shICAM1. (L) Representative images and quantification
  of Hepa1-6 cells that migrated through transwell inserts coated with shGFP-LSECs
  or shICAM1-LSECs in T.E.M. assays. GAPDH, loading control (D and K). Data are shown
  as means ± SD; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001, two-tailed unpaired Student’s
  t tests.
