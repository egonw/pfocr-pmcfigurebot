caption: The effect of PD on the mouse bleeding time and the rat blood routine. (a)
  The chemical structure of 20(S)-panaxadiol (PD). (b) The bleeding time of mouse
  tail amputation. (c) The bleeding time of mouse liver scratch. (d–f) the effect
  of PD on red blood cell parameters, including (d) red blood cell (RBC) counts, (e)
  red cell distribution width-standard deviation (RDW-SD), and (f) red cell distribution
  width-coefficient of variation (RDW-CV). (g–i) The effect of PD on platelet-related
  parameters, (g) platelet (PLT) counts, (h) plateletcrit (PCT), and (i) platelet
  larger cell ratio (P-LCR). The data are expressed as mean ± SD (n = 8). ∗p < 0.05,
  ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001 compared to the NS group.
