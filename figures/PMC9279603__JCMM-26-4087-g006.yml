caption: 'Activation of Nodal/ALK signalling pathway in preeclamptic placenta and
  in hypoxic trophoblast. Western blot analysis showed significantly upregulated protein
  levels of Nodal and ALK7 in both preeclamptic placentas (A) and HTR8/SVneo cells
  in hypoxia for 24 h (B), in comparison with their controls, respectively. Values
  denote the mean ± SD; *p < 0.01 versus NC; #p < 0.05 versus NC. (C) Western blot
  demonstrated the alterations of H3K27me3 in placental samples from PE patients,
  compared with normal placentas. Values denote the mean ± SD; *p < 0.01 versus NC.
  (D) Immunohistochemistry showed H3K27me3 was predominantly expressed in the nuclei
  of trophoblast cell in normal pregnancy, the staining of which was markedly decreased
  in preeclamptic placenta. Scale bar = 100 μm'
