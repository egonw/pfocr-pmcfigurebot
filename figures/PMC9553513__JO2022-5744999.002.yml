caption: Prognostic significance of miR-3651. (a) Serum miR-3651 in HCC patients before
  and after therapy (n = 83). (b) Comparison of miR-3651 expression between the patients
  who died finally (n = 17) and those who survived (n = 61). (c) ROC curve of miR-3651
  for forecasting the death of HCC patients within 2 years after therapy. (d) Survival
  curves of the high- (n = 33) and low-expression groups (n = 45). Comparison of two
  groups âˆ—P < 0.05.
