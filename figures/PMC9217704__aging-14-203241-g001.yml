caption: Pathological and clinical prognostic analyses of CXCR4, EMT-and CSC-related
  protein expressions in epithelial ovarian cancer patients. (A) Expressions of CXCR4
  and E-cadherin, N-cadherin, CD133, and NANOG in EOC and benign epithelial ovarian
  tumour tissues were analysed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining with the indicated
  antibody against each protein examined. Notably, presence of CXCR4 expression is
  in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) tissues (mainly located in cytoplasm), but absence
  of CXCR4 expression in benign epithelial ovarian tumour tissues. E-cadherin expression
  was higher in CXCR4-negative EOC tissues than in CXCR4-positive samples. Tumour
  cells in the CXCR4-negative section did not express N-cadherin or vimentin, whereas
  some tumour cells in the CXCR4-positive section expressed vimentin, snail, CD44,
  CD133 and NANOG. (B–E) Kaplan–Meier survival curve analyses of the association between
  survival probability and CXCR4, E-cadherin, CD133 and NANOG expression using the
  log rank test E-cadherin (B); CXCR4 (C), CD133 (D), NONOG (E) expression.
