caption: ACS/TFD NPs orchestrated alterations in the DEHP-triggered malignancy-associated
  signaling pathway. (A) The heat map represents the protein profiles of MKN45 cells
  influenced by diverse concentrations of DEHP treatment. (B) An envisioned signaling
  pathway potentially induced by DEHP was proposed. (C) ACS/TFD NPs exerted modulation
  over metastasis-related proteins in DEHP-treated MKN45 cells, encompassing p-PI3K,
  PTEN, p-PDK1, p-AKT, p-mTOR, ECAD, NCAD, and VIM.
