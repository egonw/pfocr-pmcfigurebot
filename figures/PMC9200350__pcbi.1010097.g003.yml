caption: In (A) the UMAP embedding is colored by cell type label (left) and cluster
  (right), with major cell type populations highlighted in the figure. For a complete
  overview of cell types, see Fig B in . In (B), the enrichment of the MAPK pathway
  is exemplified. In (C), UMAPs showing the gene expression of CCND1 and CDK4 are
  shown as selected examples of individual gene expression plots. The UMAP in (D)
  shows the drug candidate identification result for the drug palbociclib.
