  hets in the SC pathway
caption: 'A Example traces depicting a single EPSP followed by a compound EPSP at
  increasing stimulation intensities (light to dark) over consecutive recording sweeps.
  The red trace represents the response at maximal stimulation intensity in the presence
  of 50 µM D-APV. The left inset depicts a zoomed-in view of the single EPSP, where
  rising subthreshold slope was measured. The right inset depicts a zoomed-in view
  of the compound EPSP decay, where the AUC was measured. B Example relationships
  between the single EPSP rising subthreshold slope and the compound EPSP decay AUC
  across genotype, with the change points marked by black circles. Change point (EPSP
  rising subthreshold slope mV/mS) (3-way ANOVA: genotype main effect: F1, 34 = 12.625,
  P = 0.001) (C) and AUC/slope ratio (3-way ANOVA: genotype main effect: F1, 34 = 8.003,
  P = 0.009) (D) across genotype. Hets: 15 cells, 9 animals and wts: 19 cells, 12
  animals. Summary values depicted as mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001
  (3-way ANOVA between subject effect).'
