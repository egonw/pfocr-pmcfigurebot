caption: 'Downregulation of CFHR3 is induced by miR-590-3p binding to the 3’ UTR of
  CFHR3. (A–E) CFHR3-overexpressed MHCC-97L cells were treated with the indicated
  15nM miR-590-3p precursor, and CFHR3 protein levels (A), cell growth (B), migration,
  and invasion (C–E) were determined. (F) Tow binding sites of miR-590-3p in the 3’
  UTR of CFHR3 were predicted by the TargetScan programs. (G) A schematic diagram
  shows the miR-590-3p binding site in the 3’ UTR (wild-type and corresponding mutants)
  of CFHR3. (H) MHCC-97L cells were co-transfected with a CFHR3 3’ UTR reporter and
  the indicated concentrations of the miR-590-3p precursor, and the luciferase activities
  were measured (n=3). (I) MHCC-97L cells were co-transfected with miR-590-3p precursor
  and CFHR3 3’ UTR wild-type or indicated mutated reporter, and the luciferase activities
  were measured (n=3). (Remarks: * represents P < 0.05; ** represents P < 0.01; ***
  represents P < 0.001; Data are presented as mean ± SD).'
