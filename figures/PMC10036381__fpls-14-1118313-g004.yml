caption: 'Lignin biosynthesis pathway. This pathway has been modified based on recently
  published papers (please see the main text of section 4.4). PAL (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase),
  C4H (cinnamate 4-hydroxylase), 4CL (4-coumarate: CoA ligase), CCR (cinnamoyl CoA
  reductase), CCoAOMT (caffeoyl CoA O-methyltransferase), F5H (ferulate 5-hydroxylase),
  COMT (caffeate 3-O-methyltransferase), and CAD are involved in the synthesis of
  monolignols. POD (peroxidase) and LAC (laccase) are involved in the polymerization
  of monolignols to yield the lignin polymer as a final product. Green arrows represent
  genes up-regulated in different species under salt stress conditions according to
  recent papers [(), (), (), and ()].'
