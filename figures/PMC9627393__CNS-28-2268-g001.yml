caption: Flowchart of the experiment. HIBI was induced by ischemia and hypoxia manipulation.
  Rats were randomly intracerebroventricularly injected with Fer‐1 or Res 30 min before
  HIBI induction. (A) Illustration of behavioral testing. OFT was employed on day
  28 post‐birth, and the MWM test was performed on days 29 through 34 post‐birth.
  (B) Illustration of ferroptosis occurrence, brain damage, and body weight measurement.
  Western blot was conducted 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after HIBI surgeries to determine
  when ferroptosis peaked. Rats were sacrificed for a series of experiments (ie immunofluorescence,
  TEM, MDA assays, and measurements of iron content) at 24‐h post‐HIBI. Body weight
  measurements were conducted on 7‐, 14‐, and 34‐day post‐birth. The weight ratios
  of left/right hemisphere measurements were conducted on 14‐day post‐birth. Nissl
  staining and brain morphology were assessed at 34‐day post‐birth. HIBI, hypoxic–ischemic
  brain injury; ICV, intracerebroventricular; Fer‐1, ferrostatin‐1; Res, resveratrol;
  OFT, open‐field test; MWM, Morris water maze; MDA, malondialdehyde; TEM, transmission
  electron microscopy.
