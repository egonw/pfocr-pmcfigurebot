caption: Histopathological examination under microscope of essential organs. Normal
  tissues have been obtained from fetus of 12Â weeks gestation and without relative
  disease. (a) Fetus proband in case 1. Histopathological images showed structure
  of primary glomerulus and renal tubules in both bilateral kidneys, part of those
  tubules undergoing cystic dilatation (black arrow in panels 1, 2). Local brain tissue
  edema and neuronal degeneration within neurons, glial cells, and primitive neural
  tubes (black arrow in panel 3). Hepatic cells are normal (panel 4) HE staining.
  (b) Fetus proband in case 2. Extensive cystic renal tissues can be observed, without
  obvious cortex and medulla, on both side of the kidneys (black arrow in panels 1,2).
  Image of encephalocele tissues could not find stratification (black arrow in panel
  3). Hepatic cells are normal (panel 4). HE staining
