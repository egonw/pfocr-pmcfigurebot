caption: Working model for the role of LOS2 in plant growth and immunity. The Arabidopsis
  LOS2 gene encodes only a glycolytic enzyme enolase, but not the proposed MBP-1 protein.
  In WT plants, the homeostasis of glycolysis is critical for unperturbed metabolism
  and this is required for a balanced status of growth, development, and immunity.
  In the los2 mutant, enolase activity is reduced, resulting in a perturbation of
  the glycolysis pathway and consequently of metabolism. The perturbed metabolism
  causes reduced growth and abnormal development. Importantly, the perturbed metabolism
  causes altered metabolites which might be sensed by NLR proteins or induce NLR transcription
  to trigger NLR activation. The activation of NLR proteins initiates downstream immune
  responses including the accumulation of SA which in turn induces NLR expression
  (blue arrow), resulting in a positive feedback loop to boost immunity. On one hand,
  defense responses repress plant growth, but not affect plant development. On the
  other hand, defense responses further disturb the perturbed metabolism (red arrows)
  by promoting the accumulation of sugars and organic acids or depleting of glycolytic
  metabolite GAP, leading to a second positive feedback loop for a robust immune response.
  Therefore, LOS2 is critical for a balanced growth and defense status in plants by
  maintaining metabolism homeostasis.
