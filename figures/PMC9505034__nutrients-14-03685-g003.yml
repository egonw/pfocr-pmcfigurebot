caption: 'Regulation of mitotic clonal expansion (MCE) in EEIP-treated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.
  Cells were differentiated into adipocytes in differentiation media (DM), with or
  without EEIP (25, 50, or 100 μg/mL), for 24 h. (A) Cell cycle progression was analyzed
  by flow cytometry in EEIP-treated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. (B) Protein levels of cell
  cycle regulatory proteins were determined by Western blotting analysis. β-actin
  was used as the internal control. Densitometric analysis was performed using Bio-Rad
  Quantity One Software (BioRad; Hercules, CA, USA). Values are represented as the
  mean ± SD, #p < 0.05 vs. the GM group, *** p < 0.001 vs. the DM group.'
