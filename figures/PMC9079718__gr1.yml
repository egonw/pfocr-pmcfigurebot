caption: 'Effects of MG53 on the proliferation and migration of hUC-MSCs in P5, P10
  and P15. (A) Cell viability analyzed by CCK-8 assay. (B) Representative images of
  Transwell assay. (C) The migrated cell in each group. (D) Cell cycle proportion
  changes in different groups. Data were presented as mean ± SEM. N = 3 per group.
  Scale bar = 200 μm *: Compared with P5 group, P < 0.05; #: Compared with P10 group,
  P < 0.05; Δ: Compared with P15, P < 0.05.'
article_title: MG53 protein rejuvenates hUC-MSCs and facilitates their therapeutic
  effects in AD mice by activating Nrf2 signaling pathway.
