caption: Comparisons of T. gondii acute stage and chronic stage in intermediate hosts.
  (A) Characteristics of tachyzoites and bradyzoites. In intermediate hosts, the rapidly
  dividing tachyzoites and slowly growing bradyzoites differ in many characteristics,
  including (i) stage-specific markers; (ii) metabolism; (iii) translational control;
  and (iv) tropism. (i) The stage-specific proteins contain SAGs and HSPs as well
  as some membrane-associated proteins exported to PV membrane (ROPs and GRAs) and
  cyst wall (CSTs and MCPs). (ii) Central carbon metabolism (the glycolytic pathway
  and the tricarboxylic acid cycle) and gluconeogenesis allow intracellular tachyzoites
  to survive promiscuously. However, bradyzoites lack a functional TCA cycle and respiratory
  chain but accumulate abundant polysaccharide–AG in the cytoplasm. (iii) The eIF2α
  phosphorylation regulated by TgIF2K-A and TgIF2K-B leads to the reprogramming of
  the transcriptome and initiation and maintenance of parasite latency. TgIF2K-C and
  TgIF2K-D have been reported to protect tachyzoite against amino acid starvation.
  (iv) The tachyzoites can infect almost all nucleated cells especially fibroblasts,
  and hijack monocytes and DCs to promote their systemic dissemination. These tachyzoites
  can spontaneously differentiate into bradyzoites, forming semi-dormant cysts in
  brain cells (neurons) and muscle cells (SkMCs). (B) The proliferation and immune
  evasion of parasites. In tachyzoite, ROPs and GRAs secreted from rhoptries and dense
  granules contribute to the formation of PVM and IVN. Meanwhile, IST-dependent suppression
  of interferon signaling and ROP18 virulence complex (ROP18/ROP5/ROP17/GRA7/GRA60)-
  dependent phosphorylation of IRGs contribute to parasite evasion from immune-mediated
  destruction. Bradyzoites within the cyst are encapsulated by the cyst wall (the
  components include CSTs, MCPs, etc.). The cyst wall is organized into dense and
  loose layers, and tubules and vesicles are present in an ICN of the cyst matrix,
  linking bradyzoites together and connecting bradyzoites to the cyst wall. The cyst
  matrix protein MAG2 interacts with the ICN and GRAs and contributes to the maturation
  of the cyst matrix. In addition, IST, NSM, and MAG1 act as T. gondii immunomodulatory
  effectors to prevent host cell death and counteract the host immune responses.
