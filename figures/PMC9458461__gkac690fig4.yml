caption: Sab-mitofusins interaction serves as a platform on which JNK is activated.
  (A) U2OS cells were immunostaind with anti-p-JNK (green) and MitoTracker (red) in
  the presence or absence of H2O2 (500 μM) for 20 min and imaged under Nikon A1 confocal
  microscopy. MitoTracker represents mitochondria, and Pearson's correlation between
  p-JNK and mitochondria markers was analyzed. scale bars, 10 μm. (B) U2OS cells stably
  expressing MFN1 shRNA were treated with H2O2 treatment for 20 min. U2OS cells were
  stained with anti-p-JNK (green), Mitotracker (red) and DAPI (blue). Bar graphs represent
  mean ± SEM from three independent experiments showing relative signal intensity
  of p-JNK (shCtrl n = 36 and shMFN1 n = 42) at the mitochondria. *** P < 0.001 versus
  control shRNA by two-sided unpaired Student's t-test. scale bars, 10 μm. (C) FLAG-Sab
  plasmid was transfected into U2OS cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody,
  followed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. (D) Control or MFN1 shRNA
  expressing U2OS cells were transfected with FLAG-Sab plasmid and treated with H2O2
  for 20 min. Cell lysates were followed by immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG and
  immunoblotted with the anti-JNK antibodies. (E) Control or MFN1 depleted U2OS cells
  were treated with Phleo for 2 h. Cell lysates were used for immunoprecipitation
  with anti-JNK antibody and followed by immunoblotting with anti-Sab antibodies.
  (F) U2OS were transfected with FLAG-Sab plasmid. Cells were subjected to H2O2 for
  20 min in presence of 50 mM glucose for 5 h. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated
  with FLAG antibody and immunoblotted with the anti-JNK antibodies. (G, H) U2OS cells
  were transfected with siRNA against Sab and obtained after H2O2 treatment for 20
  min. The p-JNK or p-ATM expression levels were quantified by using imageJ. Bars
  represent mean ± SEM from three independent experiments. *** P < 0.001 versus control
  siRNA by two-sided unpaired Student's t-test.
