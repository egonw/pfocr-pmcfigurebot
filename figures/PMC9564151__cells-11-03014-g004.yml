caption: 'HIF-1α Signaling Pathways in control Fibroblasts. Colored nodes refer to
  differentially expressed genes found in our dataset control fibroblasts hypoxia
  vs. normoxia (green down-regulated; red up-regulated). Uncolored nodes were not
  identified as differentially expressed in our experiment and were integrated into
  the computationally generated IPA networks. This figure was created with Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis, Version 2000–2022 QIAGEN. For further information about the symbols,
