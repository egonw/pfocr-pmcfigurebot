caption: Effect of mTOR siRNA gene knockdown of growth and polyamine content. MCF-7
  cells were grown to 50% confluence in 6-well plate and transfected with mTOR siRNA
  (30 nM final concentration) for 48 h and 72 h, thereafter cells were harvested.
  (a) Cell number was determined after 48 h and 72 h mTOR siRNA transfection by trypan-blue
  exclusion assay. (b) Polyamine content of cells after mTOR siRNA transfection was
  estimated by LC-MS. Values shown are mean ± S.E.M, for three independent experiments
  for (a) and mean ± range, for two independent experiment for (b), with two replicates
  per treatment and analyzed using ANOVA and Dunnett’s post-test, where ** p < 0.01,
  **** p < 0.0001. Control represents untreated cells, ns represents no significant
  difference.
