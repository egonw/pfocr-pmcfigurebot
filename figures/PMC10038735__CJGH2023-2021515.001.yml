caption: NMT1 was upregulated in GC tissues and might be a potential biomarker of
  GC diagnosis. (a) The differentially expressed NMT1 between GC (n = 408) and normal
  (n = 211) tissue samples was analyzed by GEPIA (http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/). (b)
  The overall survival of GC patients with high (n = 605) or low (n = 270) NMT1 expression
  was analyzed by GEPIA, p = 1.1e-05. ∗p < 0.05 vs. Normal tissues. NMT1, N-myristoyltransferase
  1; GC, gastric cancer; GEPIA, gene expression profiling interactive analysis.
