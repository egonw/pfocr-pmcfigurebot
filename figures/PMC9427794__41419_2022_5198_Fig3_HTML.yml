figure_title: The promoting effect of GASP1 on the invasiveness of breast cancer cells
caption: a GASP1 knockout suppressed the migration and invasion potential of HCC1937
  and MCF7 cells. The representative pictures of migrated/invaded cells were shown
  in the left panels, and statistical data of cell numbers was shown in the right
  panels. b GASP1 knockout down-regulated the expression of several metastasis-related
  genes in HCC1937 and MCF7 cells compared with the control, including N-cadherin,
  MMP9, MMP2, Slug, and snail. c GASP1 overexpression enhanced the migration and invasion
  potential of MDA-MB-231 and DU4475 cells. The representative pictures were shown
  in the left panels and migrated/invaded cell quantification was shown in the right
  panels. d Ectopic expression of GASP1 in MDA-MB-231 and DU4475 cells up-regulated
  the expression of N-cadherin, MMP9, MMP2, Slug, and snail. Data were presented as
  mean ± SD. ***P < 0.0001.

  their response to paclitaxel by forming a vicious cycle with IGF1/IGF1R signaling
  pathway.
