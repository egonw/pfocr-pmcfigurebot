  versus the control group. Data are presented as mean ± SEM (N = 4). Please note
  that since representative blots for  and A were obtained from the same gel, the
  β-Actin blot represented in these figures are the same. For clarity, the background
  to panel A was made lighter in Photoshop. Full uncropped blots are provided as .
  Thapsigargin (TG), 4-Phenylbutyric acid (PBA).
