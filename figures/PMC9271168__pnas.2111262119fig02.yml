caption: Example of signaling relationships extracted from the global stress response
  network. Discussion of each highlighted pathway is present in either the main text
  or SI Appendix, Supplemental Discussion. (A) Examples of upstream regulators and
  downstream targets of specialized stress response pathways. OH, hydroxyl; Ub, ubiquitin.
  (B) Examples of crosstalk factors located in the center of the network, which have
  known roles in the integration of specialized stress responses. CoCl2, cobalt chloride;
  L2FC, Log2 fold change; UPR, unfolded protein response.
article_title: C16orf72/HAPSTR1 is a molecular rheostat in an integrated network of
  stress response pathways.
