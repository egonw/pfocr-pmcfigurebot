caption: 'Regulation of PPAR-γ activity in lipid-laden hepatocytes affects macrophage
  polarization and inflammation. Primary hepatocytes were preincubated with the PPAR-γ
  agonist GW1929 for 3 h, followed by treatment with free fatty acids (FFAs) for 24
  h (GW1929+FFA). Primary hepatocytes were isolated from PPAR-γfl/fl and PPAR-γ▲hep
  mice and treated with FFA for 24 h. Cell culture supernatants of hepatocytes were
  collected and prepared for different conditioned mediums (CMs). Macrophages were
  treated with different CMs for 6 h for RT–PCR or 24 h for western blotting. A: mRNA
  expression of M1/M2 markers in macrophages treated with CM; B: Protein expression
  of the TLR4/NF-κB pathway in macrophages treated with CM; C: mRNA expression of
  M1/M2 markers in macrophages treated with CM from PPAR-γ knockout hepatocytes; D:
  Protein expression of the TLR4/NF-κB pathway in macrophages treated with CM from
  PPAR-γ knockout hepatocytes. Values are expressed as the mean ± SE of the mean,
  aP < 0.05, bP < 0.01 vs CM- normal control (NC) or CM-NC-ppar-γfl/fl; cP < 0.05,
  dP < 0.01 comparison of the designated two groups, n = 3 experiments. NC: Normal
  control; CM: Conditioned medium; Nos: Nitric oxide synthase; Tnf: Tumor necrosis
  factor; Il: Interleukin; Arg1: Arginine-1; Mrc2: Mannose receptor 2; TLR4: Toll-like
  receptor 4; NF-κB: Nuclear factor kappa-B; IκBα: Inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B.'
