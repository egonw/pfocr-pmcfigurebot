caption: Upregulation of SIRT6 inhibits growth of pancreatic cancer xenografts in
  vivo. (A) Different groups of PANC-1 cells (vector and SIRT6-overexpressing) were
  inoculated subcutaneously (200 ml) in nude mice at a density of 1x106/ml and the
  xenografted tumor size was measured every 7 days. After 28 days, the tumor was stripped
  from euthanized mice, and the tumor growth curve was drawn. (B and C) The body weight
  and xenografted tumor mass of nude mice were calculated. (D) The expression levels
  of GPX4, SLC7A11, HK2 and LDHA were assessed by immunohistochemistry. (E) Nuclear
  NF-κB p65 and cytoplasmic IkBα protein levels were detected by western blot analysis.
  **P<0.01 vs. vector group. SIRT6, sirtuin6; GPX4, glutathione peroxidase 4; HK,
  hexokinase; LDHA, lactate dehydrogenase A.
