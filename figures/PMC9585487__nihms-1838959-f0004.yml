  specificity in MPNST cells
caption: '(A) Heatmap of ChIP-seq signal intensity of FOXC1, H3K27ac, H3K4me3, and
  H3K27me3 peaks in T265 without (âˆ’Dox) or with (+Dox) a functional PRC2 restored.
  ChIP-seq signals were calculated over 11,613 FOXC1 peaks that were segmented into
  three categories: promoter (281 peaks within 1,000 bp of the transcription start
  site), enhancer (5,821 peaks overlapping enhancers determined by ROSE using the
  H3K27ac ChIP-seq results), and others (5,511 peaks not at promoters or that do not
  overlap with enhancers).(B) Composite plot of FOXC1, H3K27ac, H3K4me3, and H3K27me3
  ChIP-seq signal intensity over 11,613 FOXC1 binding sites, showing that FOXC1 peaks
  overlapped with H3K27ac signals.(C) IGV tracks of the SMAD3 locus (left) and qRT-PCR
  quantification showing that SMAD3 mRNA level (right) increased after FOXC1 knockdown.(D)
  IGV tracks at the TGFBI locus (left), showing multiple FOXC1 peaks and the corresponding
  reduction of H3K27ac signals, as well as qRT-PCR quantification (right) of decreased
  expression of this gene.(E) A table presenting the HOMER motif analysis results
  using FOXC1 ChIP-seq peaks. The top four de novo motif categories and the best-matched
  TFs representing that motif are shown.(F) Gene ontology pathway analysis of genes
  associated with enhancers bound by FOXC1 in T265 cells.(G) Heatmap showing the transcriptional
  alterations of direct FOXC1-targeted genes upon CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of
  FOXC1 in T265 cells.(H) Enrichment plot demonstrating that Ras signaling genes ()
  were inhibited by FOXC1 knockout in T265 cells. NES, normalized enrichment score.'
