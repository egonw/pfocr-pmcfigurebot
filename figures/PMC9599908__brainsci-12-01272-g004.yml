caption: TLTC upgrades a Long-term potentiation (LTP) and Long-term depression (LTD)
  in the Schaffer-CA1 collateral pathway. (A) Insert, representative traces of field
  excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) recorded 10 min before (a) and 40 min
  after (b) the application of the theta-burst stimulation protocol (The TBS are short
  trains of high-frequency of stimuli repeated at intervals of 200 ms). LTP induced
  by 4xTBS protocol at the Schaffer Collateral-CA1 synapse. The 4xTBS protocol was
  delivered during the time indicated by the black arrow. The dashed horizontal line
  indicates the baseline recording (before 4xTBS) as a 100% response. (B) Magnitude
  of average LTP measured in (b) for transgenic mice with Alzheimer’s disease without
  (ALZ, blue bar) and with TLTC (ALZ + TLTC, green bar), and control group, also subdivided
  into mice without (WT, black bar) and with TLTC (WT + TLTC, gray bar). (C) Insert,
  representative traces of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) recorded
  10 min before (a) and 50 min after (b) the application of the low-frequency stimulation
  protocol (LFS; 900 pulses/15 min). LTD) induced by LFS protocol at the Collaterals
  of Schaffer-CA1 synapses. The LFS protocol was delivered during the time indicated
  by the black bar. The dashed horizontal line indicates the baseline recording (before
  LFS) as a 100% response. (D) Magnitude of average LTD measured in (b) for transgenic
  mice with Alzheimer’s disease without (ALZ, blue bar) and with TLTC (ALZ + TLTC,
  green bar), and control group, also subdivided into mice without (WT, black bar)
  and with TLTC (WT + TLTC, gray bar). The number of asterisks indicate the strength
  of statistical significance (** p ≤ 0.01; *** p ≤ 0.001; **** p ≤ 0.0001).
