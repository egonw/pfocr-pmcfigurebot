caption: ANKRD29 was a potential target for NSCLC treatment. A-B Representative IHC
  images of ANKRD29 in NSCLC tissue microarray. (B) Quantification data for (A), Scale
  bar = 100 μm. C-E NSCLC patients with low ANKRD29 expression had a worse prognosis
  examined by tissue microarray (C), KM plotter (D) and PrognoScan websites (E), respectively.
  F Volcano plot showed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after overexpression
  of ANKRD29 expression by using RNA-seq analysis in H1975. G-H GO (G) and KEGG (H)
  analysis using DEGs enriched the pathways affected by upregulation of ANKRD29 expression.
  I Pearson correlation analysis was performed between ANKRD29 expression and drug
  IC50 using the GDSC database. J Molecular docking profiles of BEZ235-2 and AKT inhibitor
  VIII with ANKRD29. Bars are the mean value ± SD. ns = no significant. * P < 0.05,
  ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001
article_title: ANKRD29, as a new prognostic and immunological biomarker of non–small
  cell lung cancer, inhibits cell growth and migration by regulating MAPK signaling
  pathway.
