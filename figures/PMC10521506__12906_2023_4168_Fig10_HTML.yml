caption: A schematic representation of the predicted ceRNA pathway in a cancer cell
  treated with N-MT. As can be seen, N-MT-treated cancer cells witnessed an alteration
  in various genes expression that eventually leads to apoptosis of cancer cells.
  LINC01093 has been predicted to have an association with miR-155-3p which is decreased
  and result in the SOCS2 and PHLDA1 increment. (This figure was drawn by the BioRender
  site (https://app.biorender.com)
article_title: Milk thistle nano-micelle formulation promotes cell cycle arrest and
  apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells through modulating miR-155-3p /SOCS2
  /PHLDA1 signaling axis.
