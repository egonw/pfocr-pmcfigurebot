caption: Examination of the function of upregulated genes in branch 2. (a) The top
  100 hub gene network in gene cluster1 (described in ), showing genes that were upregulated
  in branch 2. The function of these genes was classified and color-coded based on
  reports in the literature. (b) Differences in expression of Gpx3, Gstm1, Gsta3,
  Ggt5, and fibroblast-promoting genes in the different cell trajectories. (c) Heat
  map showing the relative expression levels of key genes related to fatty acid (FA)
  signals, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, glycolytic pathway, and mitochondrial respiration
  in each branch.
