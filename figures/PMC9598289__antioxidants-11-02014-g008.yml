caption: 9r modulates Nrf2 to exert antioxidant activity. (A,B) Nrf2, HO-1, IL-6 and
  apoptosisâˆ’related proteins were analyzed using Western blotting. The Image Lab application
  estimated the relative intensity of Nrf2, HO-1, IL-6, P53 and Cl-PARP. The data
  are provided as the mean and standard deviation of three separate experiments. *
  p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 when compared to the specified group.

  Derivatives as Antioxidants against H2O2-Induced Oxidative Injury via the IL-6/Nrf2
  Loop Pathway.
