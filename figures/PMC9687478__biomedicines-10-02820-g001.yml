caption: Innate immune cells sense viruses using distinct pattern recognition receptors
  (PRRs). Surface Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and TLRs located in endosomes, cytosolic
  nucleic acid sensors, RLRs, and DNA sensors detect viral nucleic acids or viral
  proteins. Most viral proteins are either components of the capsid or the envelope
  of the virus. Viral envelope glycoproteins are sensed via surface TLRs, such as
  TLR1/2, TLR2/6, and TLR4. Homo- or heterodimer formation initiates signaling to
  the two major downstream adaptor molecules, myeloid differentiation primary response
  88 (MyD88) and Toll-interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adapter-inducing
  IFN-β (TRIF). Downstream signaling from surface TLRs requires the MyD88-dependent
  pathway. In endosomes, TLR3 detects double-stranded RNA (dsRNA); TLR7/8 detects
  single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), while TLR9 detects CpG DNA. TLR7/8 and TLR9 recruit
  the signaling adaptor molecule MyD88 to activate the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, resulting
  in the activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cell
  (NF-κB) and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family members. In contrast, TLR3
  binds with TRIF in order to activate downstream signaling, resulting in IRF3/7 translocation
  to the nucleus. The cytosolic sensors, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and
  melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5), sense viral dsRNA, and signal
  transduction occurs through the adaptor molecule mitochondrial antiviral-signaling
  protein (MAVS) located at the mitochondria that activates the TANK-binding kinase-1
  (TBK1) and IκB kinase ε (IKKε) complex resulting in activation of NF-κB and IRFs.
  Cytoplasmic DNA is sensed through cytosolic DNA sensor cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS),
  which synthesizes cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP)
  in order to induce the ER-resident stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and leads
  to the activation of downstream molecules through the TBK1/IKKε complex. When NF-κB
  and IRFs are activated, they translocate to the nucleus and trigger the expression
  of proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferon (IFN) production. Secretion of
  these proteins promotes interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) production, which results
  in the establishment of the “antiviral state”, recruitment of innate immune cells
  to sites of infection, and activation of the adaptive immunity to shape the overall
  antiviral immune response.
