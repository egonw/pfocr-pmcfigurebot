caption: Eupatilin inhibited TNF-α-induced NP cells, upregulated the MMP family, downregulated
  SOX9 and COL2A1, and P-P65 enters the nucleus. (A) RT qPCR was used to detect the
  expression of anabolic and catabolic genes SOX9 containing MMP3, MMP7, MMP9, and
  MMP13 after treatment with TNF-α (20 ng/ml) with or without eupatilin (12.5 μM)
  for 24 h (n = 3). (B) Phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 were
  detected by immunofluorescence assay after 20 min of TNF-α (20 ng/ml) alone or 2 h
  of eupatilin (6.25 μM, 12.5 μM) pretreatment, followed by 20 min of TNF-α (20 ng/ml).
  The expression of MMP3 and COL2A1 in NP cells was detected by immunofluorescence
  after the treatment of TNF-α (20 ng/ml) or TNF-α (20 ng/ml) and eupatilin (6.25 μM,
  12.5 μM) for 24 h. Scale bar, 20 μm. These genes were standardized for GAPDH expression.
  Data are presented as the mean ± SD. n = 3, compared with the TNF-α-alone group.
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001.
