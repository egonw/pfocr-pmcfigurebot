caption: CK2 is the crucial member of the canonical Wnt signaling pathwayMutant CK2
  has reduced the phosphorylation rate of β-catenin, which thus fails to translocate
  to the nucleus and consequently affects the regulation of Wnt target genes. This
  disruption of Wnt signaling leads to the phenotype seen in the studied patient.
