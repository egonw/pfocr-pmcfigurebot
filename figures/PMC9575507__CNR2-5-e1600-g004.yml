caption: Effect of Chloroxylon swietenia leaves methanol extract (CSLME) on colony
  formation ability of MCF‐7 cells. Representative images of the clonogenic assay
  showing the effect of CSLME (10, 15, and 20 μg/ml) on colony formation ability of
  MCF‐7 cells. MCF‐7 cells were seeded at low density in six well plates and allowed
  to form colonies. The cells were fixed, stained by crystal violet and number of
  colonies were counted using colony counter. The data represents percent colonies
  formed in treated samples compared to untreated cells. A significant reduction in
  the number of colonies 36%, 26.5%, and 16.9% were observed in MCF‐7 cells treated
  with 10, 15, 20 μg/ml of CSLME respectively. **p < .05 versus control. The data
  presented is the mean value of n = 3 ± SD
