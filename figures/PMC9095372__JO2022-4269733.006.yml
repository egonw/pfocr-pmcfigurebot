caption: (a) GSEA demonstrated that the apical junction complex–related gene set,
  cell-adhesion molecular-binding–related gene set, cytoplasmic dynein complex–related
  gene set, microfilament motor activity–related gene set, protein O-linked glycosylation–related
  gene set, and tight junction–related gene set were notably enriched in the MBOAT2
  high-expression group. (b) GSEA demonstrated that the leukocyte activation involved
  in inflammatory response–related gene set, positive T-cell selection, regulation
  of antigen processing and presentation–related gene set, and TCR complex–related
  gene set were obviously enriched in the MBOAT2 low-expression group. (c) Pathway
  enrichment analysis suggested that MBOAT2 may participate in PC, the Ras signaling
  pathway, the TCR signaling pathway, Adherens junction interactions, cell–cell communication,
  and cell junction organization.
