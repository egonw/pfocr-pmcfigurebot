caption: IFI35 increases the intratumoral number of CD8+ T cells. A–E Effect of IFI35
  overexpression on CT26 tumor-infiltrating various immune cells. IFI35 transfected
  CT26 cells were inoculated into BALB/c mice. The numbers of tumor-infiltrating CD45+
  T cells (A), CD8+ T cells (B), CD4+ T cells (C), Foxp3+ cells (D), and MDSC cells
  (E) were analyzed by flow cytometry. Cell numbers are given for 1000,000 total cells
  from each tumor. Values are represented as mean ± SEM. P values were determined
  by two tailed t-tests. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ns not significant. F–J Effect of
  IFI35 overexpression on MC38 tumor-infiltrating various immune cells. IFI35 transfected
  MC38 cells were inoculated into C57/BL6 mice. The numbers of tumor-infiltrating
  CD45+ T cells (F), CD8+ T cells (G), CD4+ T cells (H), Foxp3+ cells (I), and MDSC
  cells (J) were analyzed by flow cytometry. Cell numbers are given for 1000,000 total
  cells from each tumor. Values are represented as mean ± SEM. P values were determined
  by two tailed t-tests. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ns not significant. K–O Quantification
  of CD8+ T cells from paraffin sections of CT26 and MC38 colon cancer by IHC. K Representative
  IHC staining for CD8 in paraffin sections of MC38 colon cancer. L–O Average cell
  number per high-power field (HPF) is shown; Two tailed t-tests, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. P Positive correlation of IFI35 protein levels with
  that of CD8 IHC levels in human colorectal cancer. Q Scatterplots showing correlation
  between IFI35 expression and CD8+ T cell expression level in The Cancer Genome Atlas
  Colon Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-COAD) data collection determined by tumor immune estimation
  resource (Timer, http://cistrome.dfci. harvard.edu/TIMER/) website. R Violin plot
  showing expression of IFI35 between four CMS subtypes in the single-cell cohort.
  S Kaplan–Meier analysis of overall survival (OS) in CRC patients with low IFI35
  and low CD8 expression (n = 11), low IFI35 and high CD8 expression (n = 37), high
  IFI35 and low CD8 expression (n = 26), high IFI35 and high CD8 expression (n = 103).
  The corresponding cutoff values was calculated by the maxstat algorithm in R package
