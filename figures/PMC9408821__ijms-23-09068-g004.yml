caption: 'The ethylene signaling pathway was involved in UV-B-induced nitrate reallocation
  through regulating gene expression of the ERFs-NRT1.8 signaling module. (A,B) Expression
  of ERF1B, ORA59, and ERF104 (A) or NRT1.8 (B) was determined by qPCR in shoots and
  roots of wild-type Col-0, ein2-1, and ein3-1 plants exposed to light alone (Light)
  or with 0.5 W/m2 UV-B (UV-B) for 3 h. Data are presented as values relative to that
  of wild-type Col-0 under light treatment after normalization to those of ACTIN2.
  (C,D) Nitrate concentration was determined in leaves, hypocotyls and roots of wild-type
  Col-0, ein2-1 and ein3-1 plants exposed to light alone (Light) or with UV-B (UV-B)
  for 3 h (C), and then leaf/hypocotyl (L/H) and root/hypocotyl (R/H) nitrate ratios
  were calculated (D). Values are means Â± SE (n = 3). Values with asterisks indicate
  significant differences between light and UV-B treatments (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01;
  *** p < 0.005; ns: no significant difference).'
