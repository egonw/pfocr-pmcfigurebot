caption: Differential activity of NOTCH signaling among low -and high-density cells.
  We hierarchically clustered genes within each NOTCH signaling signature MSigDB Reactome
  (version 6.1, San Diego, USA) according to their transcription in low- and high-density
  samples. The colour of the dendrograms shows the pathway enrichment score. We plotted
  the name of each significantly upregulated gene (red) and downregulated gene (blue)
  next to the dendrogram. The circular heatmap shows the z-score of normalized gene
  expression.
