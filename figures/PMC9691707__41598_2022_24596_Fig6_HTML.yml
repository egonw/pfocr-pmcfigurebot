caption: Thymosin beta-4 expression was enhanced by Nrf2-overexpressed cells. (A–D)
  Cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA-Nrf2 plasmid DNA for 24 h. Nrf2 proteins
  were detected by western blotting. Processing (such as changing brightness and contrast)
  is applied equally to controls across the entire image. Original images of full-length
  blots were included in the  (A). HeLa cells were treated with 50 μM of H2O2 for
  24. Cells were fixed and stained with antibody against Ac-tubulin (green), Arl13b
  (red) and DAPI (blue). The representative image of primary cilia was observed with
  1000X magnification under fluorescence microscope. White arrows indicated primary
  cilia (B). The number of ciliated HeLa cells out of more than 1000 cells were counted.
  PC frequency was evaluated by the blinded double scoring (C). The mRNA expression
  of TB4 was detected by RT-PCR (D). (E) pEZX-PG02-TB4-promoter Gaussia luciferase
  (Gluc) plasmids were co-transfected with pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA-Nrf2 plasmid DNA into
  HeLa cells. Then, cells were incubated in the presence or absence of FBS. The activity
  of Gluc in cultured media was measured with luminometer using Gluc substrate. Each
  result was the representative of experiments performed at least four times and each
  experiment was performed with four samples (n = 4) in the same group. Data in bar
  graphs represents the means ± SD. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01; significantly different
  from H2O2-untreated (C) or 5% FBS-treated group (E). &p < 0.05; &&p < 0.01; significantly
  different from pcDNA3.1-transfected and H2O2-untreated or -treated group (C) or
  5% FBS- or 0% FBS-treated group (E). (F) Schematic summary for primary cilia formation
  by Nrf2 and ROS through TB4 expression to regulate CC survival and death. While
  Nrf2 conversely regulated primary cilium formation and TB4 expression in HeLa human
  cervical CCs (solid line). ROS also up-regulate TB4 expression through unknown another
  factors (marked as question mark and grey dotted line). Our findings were indicated
  by black solid lines. Pathway already known was indicated by grey solid lines.
