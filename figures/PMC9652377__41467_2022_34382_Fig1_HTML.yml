figure_title: Computational modeling and design of GPCR associations with reprogrammed
  structures and functions using QUESTS
caption: a Framework for the modeling and design of specific receptor quaternary active
  state conformations eliciting various degree of functional selectivity. The WT receptor
  modeled in the active state is assembled into dimers and then into ternary complex
  with G proteins (green) or β-arrestin (orange) to identify the distribution of quaternary
  conformations and their ability to recruit intracellular signaling proteins. The
  dimer binding interface is redesigned to stabilize and/or destabilize specific quaternary
  conformations. This design strategy enhances the quaternary conformational selectivity
  of the receptor and reprograms the functional bias of the receptor oligomer (Supplementary
  Fig. , Methods). b Quaternary structural changes act as a functional switch as the
  closed-dimer conformation interferes with the binding of a GPCR monomer to β-arrestin.
