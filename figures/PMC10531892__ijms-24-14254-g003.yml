caption: 'Inhibitory impact of TQ on caspase-1 and IL-1β expression in PBMCs and TAMs
  of HR+ BC patients, respectively. (A–C) Caspase-1 expression versus TQ concentrations.
  PBMCs isolated from HR+ BC patients were treated with TQ (0, 20, 50, and 100 µM)
  for (A) 24 h, (B) 48 h, and (C) 72 h. (D–F) IL-1β expression versus TQ concentrations.
  PBMCs isolated from HR+ BC patients were treated with TQ (0, 20, 50, and 100 µM)
  for (D) 24 h, (E) 48 h, and (F) 72 h. (G) Impact of TQ on IL-1β expression in TAMS
  isolated from HR+ BC patients after 24 h. All experiments were performed in triplicate
  and data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. Statistical analysis was
  performed using the GraphPad Prism software version 9.1.1. The data were analyzed
  using one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s multiple comparisons to compare each treated column
  and the DMSO control column (**** p value< 0.0001; *** p value < 0.001; ** p value
  < 0.01; * p < 0.05). TQ: thymoquinone; HR+: hormone receptor-positive; BC: breast
  cancer; ns: non-significant; IL-1β: Interleukin-1 beta; PBMCs: peripheral blood
  mononuclear cells; TAMs: tumor-associated macrophages.'

  Cancer (BC) Markers: CALR, NLRP3 Pathway and sPD-L1 in PBMCs of HR+ and TNBC Patients.'
