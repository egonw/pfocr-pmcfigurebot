figure_title: RTN3 can regulate the IGF2-JAK2-STAT3 pathway by interacting with GPBP1
caption: Western blot analysis showing the levels of IGF2, JAK2, p-JAK2, STAT3, p-STAT3,
  RTN3, and Î²-actin in a WT and RTN3-null mouse kidneys and b HEK293 cells in the
  si-Control and si-RTN3 groups. c Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) confirmed the interaction
  between RTN3 and GPBP1 in mouse renal tubular epithelial cells. d Immunofluorescence
  staining showing the subcellular localization of RTN3 and GPBP1 in WT and RTN3-null
  mouse primary cultured renal tubular epithelial cells. e Western blot analysis of
  the levels of GPBP1, GAPDH, and histone in the cytoplasm and nuclei of WT and RTN3-null
  mouse primary cultured renal tubular epithelial cells. f In vitro dual-luciferase
  reporter assay showing the protein interaction. g, h Western blot analysis showing
  the levels of GPBP1 and IGF2 in RTN3-null cells.
