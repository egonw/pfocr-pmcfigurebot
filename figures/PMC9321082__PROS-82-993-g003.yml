caption: Distinct molecular signatures in each NMF subtype that is associated with
  overall survival. (A) Unbiased Reactome pathway enrichment analysis depicts distinct
  biology associated with each NMF subtype. (B) Heatmap shows mean expression levels
  of some enriched pathways in (A). (C) Heatmap shows representative genes from different
  gene signatures. Red, high expression; blue, low expression. (D) Boxplot shows the
  expression levels of the gene signatures in (C). Statistical significance between
  NMF subtypes is calculated by Mann–Whitney U test, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001.
  (E) Radar plot shows the overall patterns of gene signatures in (C). (F) Kaplan–Meier
  curves showing patients with available diagnosis follow‐up data and overall survival
  stratified by NMF subtypes. p Value is computed by log‐rank test. NMF, nonnegative
  matrix factorization; TMB, tumor mutation burden [Color figure can be viewed at
