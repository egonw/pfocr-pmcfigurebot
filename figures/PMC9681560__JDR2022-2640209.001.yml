caption: 'Therapeutic effects of SHYS on DKD model rats. DKD rats were orally treated
  with different dosages of SHYS, the therapeutic effects of SHYS on DKD were evaluated
  through measuring the body weight change, FBG, level of 24 h urine protein, and
  pathological changes in the kidney. (a) SHYS treatment reduced the body weight loss
  in DKD model rats. (b) SHYS treatment decreased the FBG level in DKD model rats.
  (c) SHYS treatment reduced the level of 24 h urine protein in DKD model rats. (d,
  e) HE staining showed that the pathological changes in the kidney in DKD model rats
  were improved after SHYS treatment (black arrows indicated the glomerular hyperplasia;
  blue arrows indicated the renal tubule atrophy; yellow arrows indicated the inflammatory
  cell infiltration) (200×) (d). SHYS treatment also lowered the HE score of kidney
  injury in rats with DKD (e). (f)–(i) The Masson (f, g) and Sirius red (h, i) staining
  showed that SHYS treatment decreased the accumulation of collagen contents in kidney
  (black arrows indicated the positive expression area) (200×). Control, model, SHYS
  low-dose, and SHYS high-dose groups (n = 10 per group) ##: P < 0.01 compared with
  the control group; ∗: P < 0.05 compared with the model group; ∗∗: P < 0.01 compared
  with the model group.'
