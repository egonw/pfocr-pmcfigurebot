caption: HSP60-knockdown in HCT116 cells activates the AMPK signaling pathway and
  inhibits mTOR and protein synthesis. (A) Western blotting indicated that phosphorylation
  of AMPK (T172) in HSP60-KD HCT116 cells was increased compared with in control cells.
  (B) Western blotting indicated that the mTOR signaling pathway was inhibited in
  HSP60-KD cells compared with in control cells. (C) Diagram illustrating the effects
  of HSP60-knockdown on the adenine/AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway and proliferation
  of HCT116 cells. HSP60, heat shock protein 60; KD, knockdown; p, phosphorylated;
  4EBP1, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1; p70S6K, p70S6
  kinase.
