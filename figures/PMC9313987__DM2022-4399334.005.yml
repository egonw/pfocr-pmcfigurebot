caption: 'Evodiamine induces mitochondrial apoptosis in DU145 cells. (a) After evodiamine
  treatment (0, 1.25, 2.5, and 5.0 μM) for 24 h, the apoptotic rate of DU145 cells
  was measured by PI/Annexin V-FITC staining assay. Representative images are shown.
  Evodiamine induces cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. (b) Quantitative data
  of evodiamine-induced apoptotic cells. Data are presented as the mean ± SD (n =
  3). ∗∗∗P < 0.001 versus the control group. (c) Apoptotic morphological changes observed
  by Hoechst 33258 staining assay after evodiamine treatment (0, 1.25, 2.5, and 5.0 μM)
  for 24 h. Original magnification: 200x; scale bar: 20 μm. (d) After evodiamine treatment
  (0, 1.25, 2.5, and 5.0 μM) for 24 h, the expression levels of apoptosis-related
  proteins including pro- and cleaved-caspases 3/9, PARP, cleaved-PARP, Bax, and Bcl-2
  were detected by Western blotting. β-Actin was used as the loading control. (e)
  The quantitative data of relative protein expression shown as the mean ± SD (n =
  3). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001 versus the control group.'
