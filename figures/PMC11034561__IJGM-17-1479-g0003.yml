caption: Mechanistic studies of HTRA1 associated with the tumor microenvironment.
  (A) PN-1 expression is regulated through the EGF /PKC-Î´/MEK/ERK/EGR1 signaling pathway
  to inhibit the effect of the HTRA1 protein on tumors; (B) HTRA1 promotes the transdifferentiation
  of normal fibroblasts to CAF by activating the bFGF/FGF2 signaling axis secreted
  by gastric cancer cells through activation of the NF-kB signaling pathway; (C) in
  vascular endothelial cells, HTRA1 affects angiogenesis through the NOTCH signaling
  pathway.
