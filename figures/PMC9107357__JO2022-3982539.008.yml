caption: 'Analyses of tumor stemness, TMB, MSI, MMR deficiency, DNA methyltransferases,
  and therapeutic resistance. The correlation of UBE2S expression with tumor stemness
  was evaluated on three dimensions: DMPss (a), DNAss (b), and RNAss (c). Radar maps
  of correlation of UBE2S with TMB (d) and MSI (e). (f) Bar graph of correlation between
  UBE2S and HRD. Variation tendencies of five MMR genes (g) and four methyltransferases
  (h). (i) IC50 values of multiple drugs between UBE2S high- and low-expression groups
  obtained from CCLE database.'

  Immune Infiltration and Evasion, and Therapy Response from an Immune-Oncology Perspective.
