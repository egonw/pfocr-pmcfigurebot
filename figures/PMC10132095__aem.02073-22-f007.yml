caption: Proposed distribution of electron transfer and metabolic flow in anode-respiring
  G. sulfurreducens (A) at an EAN of +0.15 V and sufficient NH4+, (B) at an EAN of
  +0.15 V and limited NH4+, and (C) at an EAN of âˆ’0.15 V and limited NH4+. Ovals correspond
  to relevant enzymes present along the flow of electrons/metabolites. Blue ovals
  and blue dashed lines denote downregulated pathways. Purple ovals and black lines
  indicate moderate expression and flow under baseline conditions. Red ovals and red
  bold lines represent upregulated/preferential pathways. Images were created with
  BioRender.com.
