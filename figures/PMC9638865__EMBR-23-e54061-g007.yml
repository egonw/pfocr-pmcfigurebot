figure_title: A whole‐genome CRISPR/Cas9 screen to identify new HIV‐1 inhibitors
caption: A Screen strategy. GeCKO cell populations (obtained by transduction of T98G/Cas9
  cells with GeCKO v2 LV library) were IFN‐treated, challenged with HIV‐1 LVs coding
  for an antibiotic resistance gene and selected. Three rounds of IFN treatment, infection
  and selection were performed. Genomic DNAs of initial GeCKO and 3‐time selected
  populations were extracted, the sgRNA‐coding sequences amplified and sequenced.B
  Candidate gene identification. MAGeCK computational statistical tool (Li et al, )
  was used to establish a Robust Rank Aggregation (RRA) score for each gene based
  on sgRNA enrichment and number of sgRNAs per gene. Genes belonging to the type 1
  IFN response pathway (in blue) and DDX42 (in red) are shown (respective ranks into
  brackets) for 2 independent screens (the results of which were merged in the analysis).
  The dashed line indicates the significance threshold.C Candidate validation. T98G/Cas9/CD4/CXCR4/Firefly
  KO populations were generated for the 25 top hits of each screen. The control (CTRL)
  condition represents the mean of 4 negative CTRL populations, obtained with 4 non‐targeting
  sgRNAs; IFNAR1 and MX2 KO populations were used as positive controls. KO cell populations
  were treated with IFN and infected with HIV‐1 Renilla (NL4‐3/Nef‐IRES‐Renilla) and
  luciferase signals were measured 30 h later (Renilla signals were normalized to
  Firefly). IFN inhibition (i.e. ratio of untreated / IFN‐treated conditions) was
  calculated and set at 100% inhibition for CTRL. Data from technical duplicates are
  shown.
