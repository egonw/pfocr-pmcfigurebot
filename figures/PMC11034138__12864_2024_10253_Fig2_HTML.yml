caption: Bioinformatics analysis of assembled transcripts. (A). Volcano plot for up-
  and down-regulated transcripts after 120 h treatment with methyl jasmonate. Data
  points in green (close to zero) represent unchanged transcription level of a specific
  transcript compared to the control treatment. The blue points and red points represent
  the up- and down-regulated transcripts within that specific time point, respectively.
  (B). The stacked bar chart represents the number of up-regulated (cyan) and down-regulated
  (red) transcripts expressed after 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 120 h of methyl jasmonate
  treatment. (C). Intersection of up-regulated transcripts. (D). Intersection of down-regulated
  transcripts. (E). Distribution of transcripts with increased expression 6 (UP-reg6h),
  12 (UP-reg12h), 24 (UP-reg24h), 48 (UP-reg48h), 72 (UP-reg72h) and 120 h (UP-reg120h)
  after methyl jasmonate treatment illustrated with a Venn diagram. (F). Distribution
  of transcripts with decreased expression
