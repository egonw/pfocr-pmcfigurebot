caption: Impact of TA pretreatment on Cd-induced decreased renal Nrf2/HO-1 signaling
  pathway. Photomicrographs of (A) control and (B) TA-administrated mice showing marked
  immunostaining of Nrf2 antibody inside the kidney tubular epithelium (arrowhead)
  (G and T letters indicate renal glomeruli and tubules, respectively); (C) Cd-intoxicated
  mice demonstrated marked decrease of Nrf2 immunostaining antibody inside the renal
  tubular epithelium (arrowhead) (G and T letters indicate kidney glomeruli and tubules,
  respectively); (D) Cd-intoxicated mice pre-treated with 25 mg TA demonstrated an
  increase in Nrf2 immunostaining inside the renal tissues (arrowhead) (G and T letters
  indicate renal glomeruli and tubules, respectively); (E) Cd-intoxicated mice pre-treated
  with 50 mg TA demonstrated a marked increase in Nrf2 immunostaining inside the renal
  tissues (arrowhead) (G and T letters indicate renal glomeruli and tubules, respectively)
  (IHC, X 400, bar = 20 µm); (F) Image evaluation of Nrf2 immunostaining in the renal
  tissue demonstrated a remarkable decrease in Cd-intoxicated mice and a remarkable
  increase in mice pre-treated with TA; (G) TA enhanced renal HO-1 expression in Cd-intoxicated
  mice. Results are mean ± SEM, (n = 6). a p < 0.05 vs. control, while b p < 0.05
  vs. Cd.
