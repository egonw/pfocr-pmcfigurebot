caption: Signaling pathway signatures of ATF3-induced tumors are similar to those
  of human BLBC. (A) GSEA enriched gene sets cell cycle (a), p53 (b), EMT (c), TGF-beta
  (d), and Hedgehog signaling pathway (e). (B) GSEA enriched gene sets Wnt pathways
  (a), canonical Wnt pathway (b), and non-canonical Wnt pathway (c). (C) Heatmaps
  showing the expression of all Wnt pathway genes in BK5.ATF3 mice (a), expression
  of canonical Wnt genes in mouse tumors (T11035, T11640, T9232) and matched non-tumor,
  transgenic mammary gland tissue (M11035, M11640, M9232) (b), and expression of non-canonical
  Wnt genes, as in b (c). (D) Heatmap showing the expression of genes in common between
  the BK5.ATF3 mouse model and the GSEA-identified enriched genes from human basal-like
  breast cancer (BLBC) sample data contained in TCGA using the human biological process
  gene sets in Gene Ontology. For (A) and (B), the GSEA analysis was performed using
  GSEAPreranked (Subramanian, Tamayo et al. 2005) against gene sets from V5.1 of the
  Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). Gene pre-ranking was based on the p-value
  obtained from the edgeR analysis. For (A), gene sets are from V5.1 of the Molecular
  Signatures Database (MSigDB). For (B), the Wnt pathway gene set (a) was compiled
  based on GO Ontology, DAVID, the Wnt Homepage, and the scientific literature. The
  Wnt pathway gene set (a) was sub-categorized into canonical Wnt (b) and non-canonical
  Wnt (c) gene sets.
