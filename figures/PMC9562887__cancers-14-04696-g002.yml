caption: Signaling pathways altered in ovarian cancer cells. There is extensive crosstalk
  between the pathways depicted. The JAK/STAT signaling pathway and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  signaling pathway both regulate cell growth and proliferation. The JAK/STAT pathway
  activates PI3K as well as the MAPK signaling to stimulate downstream growth. The
  pathways shown also impact angiogenesis and cell migration.
