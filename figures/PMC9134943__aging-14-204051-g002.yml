caption: Volcano plot comparing gene expression between the interference group (infected
  with ILF3-specific siRNA) and the transfected negative control group in gastric
  cancer cell SGC-7901, respectively named si-ILF3 group and si-nc group. (A) The
  abscissa represents the logarithmic value of the fold change(log2FC) of the difference
  in the expression of a certain gene in the si-ILF3 group and si-nc group. The greater
  the absolute value of the abscissa, the greater the difference of expression between
  the two groups. The y-coordinate represents the negative log of p-value, namely
  the -log10 (p-value). The higher the value of ordinate was, the more the differential
  expression of genes was reliable. (B) The potential important roles that ILF3 played
  in the gastric cancer cells. (C) Genes that were potentially regulated by ILF3 expression
  in whole-genome RNA sequencing.
