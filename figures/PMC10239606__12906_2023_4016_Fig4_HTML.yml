caption: 'Effects of RES and MOS on intracellular ROS production and MOS induces ROS-mediated
  apoptosis in lung cancer cells. H23 and A549 were treated with various concentration
  of RES or MOS at 0, 2.5, and 5 µM. (A) ROS levels were detected by fluorescence
  microscopy using DCFH2-DA probe. (B) Bar graphs showed the quantitative results
  of A. (C, D) H23 and A549 cells were treated with various concentrations of MOS
  (0, 2.5, and 5 µM) and also pretreated with NAC (5 mM) for 30 min before treating
  with MOS for 24 h. The apoptotic cells were evaluated using Hoechst 33342/PI double
  staining. The bottom part shows the quantitative results of C and D. Each value
  is the mean (± SD) from triplicate experiments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001
  vs. control; #p < 0.05 vs. MOS at 2.5 or 5 µM.'
