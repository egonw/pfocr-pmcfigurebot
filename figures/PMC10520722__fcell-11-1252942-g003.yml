caption: 'The Effect of Tanshinone IIA on the TLR4/NF-κB p65 Signaling Pathway and
  Pyroptosis in HF Rats. (A): Detection of the inflammatory cytokines IL-18 and IL-1β
  was performed using ELISA. (B): The levels of TLR4, NF-κBp65, and p-NF-κBp65 were
  determined via Western blot analysis. (C): Western blot was also used to examine
  the levels of NLRP3, IL-1β, pro-IL-1β, Caspase1, pro-Caspase1, and GSDMD-N/F. #p
  < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01 VS. control group; *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 VS. model group.
  The figure demonstrates the considerable inhibitory effect of the Tanshinone IIA
  on these signaling pathways and proteins related to pyroptosis.'
