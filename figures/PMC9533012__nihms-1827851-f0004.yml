caption: 'A, Kaplan–Meier curve of overall survival (OS) with high or low JUN expression
  in TCGA PAAD patients.B, P-c-Jun staining in S100-labeled nerves from PDAC specimens
  that are close to tumor as compared with nerves from adjacent normal tissue. Scale
  bars, 20 μm. C,D, Assessment of nerves from within pancreatic specimens of non-PDAC
  pathology, PDAC, and the normal tissues adjacent to PDAC. C, Quantification of number
  of nerves per slide with no (–), low (+), or high (++) intensity P-c-Jun staining.
  Each x axis number represents a patient. D, Percentage of P-c-Jun positive nerves
  (scored + or ++) in the pancreatic specimens of non-PDAC pathology, PDAC, and the
  normal tissues adjacent to PDAC (non-PDAC, n=4; PDAC and adjacent normal, n=6 each;
  mean ± SEM). E,F, Immunofluorescence of P-c-Jun (white) in a Panc02 injected murine
  sciatic nerve expressing GFP+ SCs. P-c-Jun is expressed in the green SCs but not
  in the Panc02 cancer cells (CC). Scale bars, 50 μm. G, Quantification of P-c-Jun
  fluorescence intensity in SCs of uninjected nerves, and in SCs close to or far from
  injected Panc-02 tumor cells (near tumor: n=6; far from tumor: n=4, PBS-injected:
  n=7, mean ± SEM, representative of three independent experiments). Fluorescent intensity
  is the mean intensity measured per area of nerve covered by green SCs. H, P-c-Jun
  staining in a sciatic nerve injected with Panc-02. (1) Region adjacent to the tumor.
  (2) Region far from the tumor. Scale bars, 1000 and 100 μm. I, P-c-Jun staining
  in a normal nerve without cancer cells. Scale bar, 100 μm. J, Immunofluorescence
  of P-c-Jun in HEI-286 GFP SCs grown alone or grown mixed with MiaPaCa-2 RFP. Top
  images show P-c-Jun staining alone in HEI-286 SCs alone (left) and co-cultured HEI-286
  mixed with MiaPaCa-2 (right). Bottom overlay images allow identification of HEI-286
  SCs (green) and MiaPaCa2 (magenta). Scale bar, 50 μm. K, Quantification of P-c-Jun
  fluorescence intensity in HEI-286 SCs grown alone or mixed with MiaPaCa2. Mean fluorescence
  intensity was measured per HEI-286 SC (n>15 cells/group, mean ± SEM, representative
  of three independent experiments). L-M, Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) assessing
  axon guidance genes in cancer co-cultured HEI-286 SCs compared with HEI-286 SCs
  alone (L) and in cancer co-cultured HEI-286 compared with cancer co-cultured c-Jun
  KO HEI-286 SCs (M). NES is normalized enrichment score. N, Inferred Pathway Activation/Suppression
  (IPAS) scores for the axon guidance genes (KEGG 2019).'
