caption: PIWI pathway activity and piRNA abundance characterization in aging turquoise
  killifish gonads. (A) Heatmaps of normalized gene expression from ovaries and testes
  with aging in the GO term “piRNA metabolic pathway.” Killifish gene names and their
  best human homologs are indicated. Rows were normalized by the median expression
  level in the cognate young gonad to facilitate visualization of age-related changes.
  (B) Sequence logo plots of piRNA nucleotide composition from ovaries and testes.
  As expected, killifish piRNAs show a strong 1U bias. Note a slight 10A bias, consistent
  with active ping-pong biogenesis. (C) Stacked barplots depicting the TE family composition
  of piRNA clusters and reference genome, as a percentage of identified elements.
  (D) Heatmaps of TE-targeted piRNA abundance for TEs significantly regulated with
  age in aging killifish ovaries by DESeq2 LRT (FDR < 10−6). TE family is color-coded
  for each row. (E) Heatmaps of TE-targeted piRNA abundance for TEs significantly
  regulated with age in aging killifish testes by DESeq2 LRT (FDR < 10−6). (F) Venn
  diagram of overlap between TE-mapping piRNAs significantly up-regulated in middle-aged
  ovaries (pattern a; see D) and TEs significantly down-regulated in middle-aged ovaries
  (pattern b) (see C). Significance for larger overlap than expected calculated using
  Fisher's exact test, compared with TEs detected in both analyses. A pie chart of
  the composition of “consistent” TEs is also reported.
