caption: Glg1 is the direct target of miR-7a in ovarian granulosa cells. (A) Relative
  mRNA levels of Pkiα, Sp1, Cdc25b, and Glg1 were detected by RT-qPCR and normalized
  to GAPDH; n = 3. (B) The predicted binding sites of miR-7a and 3′-UTR of Glg1. (C)
  Schematic representation of the hybridization between miR-7 and Glg1 3′-UTR and
  the predicted minimum free energy, as calculated by RNA hybrid. Green letters indicate
  miR-7a sequences, and red letters indicate Glg1 sequences. (D) Schematic of the
  inserted GLG1 3′-UTR sequences into the psiCHECKTM-2.0 vector. (E) The relative
  luminescence intensity detected using a dual-luciferase reporter assay kit after
  the co-transfection of miR-7a-mi or nc-mi and the dual-luciferase vectors into 293FT
  cells; n = 3. (F) Relative Glg1 mRNA levels were detected by RT-qPCR and normalized
  to GAPDH; n = 3. (G) Relative Glg1 mRNA levels were detected by RT-qPCR and normalized
  to GAPDH; n = 3. (H) Cyp19a1 mRNA levels in cells were analyzed by RT-qPCR and normalized
  to GAPDH; n = 3. (I) E2 levels in the culture medium were examined by RIA; n = 3.
  Data are presented as mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05. NS, not significant.
