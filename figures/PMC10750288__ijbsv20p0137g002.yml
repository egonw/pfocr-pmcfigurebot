caption: CD73 promotes proliferation and migration of CRC cells through the MAPK pathway.
  (A-B) qRT-PCR(A) and WB(B) assays detected the expression of CD73 in a normal human
  colon mucosal epithelial cell line NCM460 and CRC cells. (C-D) WB(C) and qRT-PCR(D)
  assays were performed to verify the successful construction of CD73 overexpression
  and knockdown CRC cells. (E) CCK-8 assays were performed to determine the effects
  of CD73 on the proliferation of CRC cells. (F) Representative figures and data of
  the transwell assays for CD73 overexpression or knockdown CRC cells and their control
  cells. Bars in the right panel show the number of migrated cells. The scale bar
  represents 100 μm. (G) Representative figures of the wound-healing assays indicate
  that CD73 could stimulate migration of SW480 cells. Bars on the right represent
  the migration rates in two groups (n = 3, p < 0.001). The scale bar represents 100
  μm. (H) The result of GSEA on microarray data GSE39582 indicates an enrichment of
  MAPK signaling pathway in the CD73high samples. (I) WB assays show effects of CD73
  expression on the MAPK-ERK pathway in CRC cells. GAPDH was used as a loading control.
  (J) Rescue experiments via WB assays show effects of CD73 expression on the MAPK-ERK
  pathway in CRC cells. GAPDH was used as a loading control. The concentration of
  PD184161 used was 2.5 μM. Data in D-G are presented as means ± SD and analyzed using
  unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
