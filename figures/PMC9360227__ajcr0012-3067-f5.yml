caption: 'Increased caspase 3 and 7 activities in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer
  cells treated with PI3K inhibitors plus trastuzumab. Red fluorescence representes
  the activities of caspase 3 and 7 in treated cells. The concentration of drug was
  the same as that in the combination protocols used for western blot analysis. After
  treatment with the indicated agents, more red signal was observed in the combination
  groups compared with the control groups. The differences in caspase 3 and 7 intensity
  were statistically significant between the controls and PI3K inhibitors plus trastuzumab.
  The bar charts represent the mean caspase 3 and 7 intensity Â± SD. P-value: *P<0.05,
  **P<0.01, and ***P<0.001. A plus T: alpelisib plus trastuzumab; G plus T: GDC-0077
  plus trastuzumab.'
