caption: 'Nrf2 deficiency further promotes M1 polarization in LPS-stimulated mice
  after TP pretreatment. (a) F4/80 Immunofluorescent staining of the liver. Data are
  representative of experiments (DAPI: nucleus, F4/80: macrophages). (b) Changes in
  the proportion of monocyte-derived macrophages (F4/80+CD11b+) in Nrf2−/− mice administrated
  with TP and LPS (n = 5). (c) Changes in the proportion of liver M1 (F4/80+CD86+)
  and M2 (F4/80+CD206+) macrophages in Nrf2−/− mice administrated with TP and LPS
  (n = 5). Data are presented as mean ± SEM, ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. WT-control.'
