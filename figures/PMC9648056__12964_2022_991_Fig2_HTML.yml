caption: Single-cell transcriptomics re-analysis confirm the heterogeneity of cancer-associated
  fibroblasts (CAFs) in ovarian cancer malignant ascites. A Single-cell RNA-sequencing
  (scRNA-seq) data visualization of four CAFs populations using t-distributed stochastic
  neighbor embedding (tSNE). B Violin plots show the expression levels of canonical
  CAFs markers in CAFs populations, including myofibroblastic cancer-associated fibroblasts
  (myCAF1-2) and inflammatory cancer-associated fibroblasts (iCAF1-2). C Heatmap shows
  the pathway enrichment analysis (EnrichR [, ]) for gene sets of cluster-specific
  CAFs markers. Top 25 pathway terms (lowest adjusted P-value) selected from the WikiPathways
  2021 and MSigDB Hallmark 2020 libraries available in EnrichR [, ]. D Violin plots
  show the expression levels of ovarian cancer CAFs markers among the four CAFs populations
article_title: Single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing reveal ligands and receptors associated
  with worse overall survival in serous ovarian cancer.
