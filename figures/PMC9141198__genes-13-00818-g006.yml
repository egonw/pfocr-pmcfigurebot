caption: LncR-133a regulates FGFR1 expression and MuSCs differentiation via miR-133a-3p
  and promotes the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. (a) The expression of FGFR1 was determined
  after treatment with pEGFP-lncR-133a and/or miR-133a-3p mimics. (b) The expression
  of MyoG and MyoD were detected after treatment with pEGFP-lncR-133a and/or miR-133a-3p
  mimics. (c) The expression of FGFR1 was measured after treatment with miR-133a-3p
  inhibitor and/or si-lncR-133a. (d) The expression of MyoG and MyoD were detected
  after treatment with si-lncR-133a and/or miR-133a-3p inhibitor. (e) The expression
  level of FGFR1 in MuSCs transfected with pEGFP-lncR-133a or pEGFP-lncR-133a-mut.
  (f) The mRNA expression of MyoG and MyoD in MuSCs transfected with pEGFP-N1 or pEGFP-lncR-133a-mut.
  (g) The protein expression of MyoG and MyoD were determined in MuSCs transfected
  with pEGFP-N1 or pEGFP-lncR-133a-mut. Image Pro Plus software (version 6.0, Media
  Cybernetics) was used to compute the quantification of protein expression. (h) To
  test lncR-133a’s competitive endogenous RNA activity, FGFR1-wild was co-transfected
  into HEK293T cells with lncR-133a-wild or lncR-133a-mut. (i) LncR-133a promotes
  the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 during myoblast differentiation. In addition, pEGFP-lncR-133a,
  si-lncR-133a and Duplex NC were transfected into MuSCs. Next, cells were switched
  into the differentiation medium approximately 6 h after transfection. The total
  protein from transfected cells were isolated after culturing in the differentiation
  medium for 48 h. Data are means ± standard error of the mean of at least three biological
  replicates, * p < 0.05.
