caption: 'BP and MF analyses of the DEGs. BP showed that the up-regulated DEGs were
  mainly enriched in progress: cell-cell signaling, collagen catabolic process, chemokine-mediated
  signaling pathway, positive regulation of cell proliferation, inflammatory response
  and neutrophil chemotaxis et.al. These down-regulated genes participated in vital
  biological processes: ethanol oxidation, cellular protein metabolic process, antibacterial
  humoral response, hexose transport, adenylate cyclase-activating G-protein coupled
  receptor signaling pathway, alcohol metabolic process, proteolysis, gluconeogenesis,
  cell surface receptor signaling pathway, and chemical synaptic transmission plasminogen
  activation et.al. MF for the up-regulated and down-regulated DEGs were also conducted
  shown in right half of figure .'
