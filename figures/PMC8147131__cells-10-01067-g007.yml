caption: Scheme summarizing the observed mechanisms affected by metformin in endometrial
  cancer cells. Besides AMPK activation, metformin modulates the UPR by activating
  the PERK/ATF4/CHOP axis and inhibiting the ATF6/GRP78 axis. Furthermore, metformin
  inhibits the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by reducing β-catenin expression.

  Pathway in Endometrial Cancer Cells through an AMPK-Independent Mechanism.
