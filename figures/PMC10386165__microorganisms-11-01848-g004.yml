caption: Remodeling of the flavonoid metabolism pathway in Deinococcus sp. 43. Genes
  annotated in the Deinococcus sp. 43 genome are shown in bold green text; genes unannotated
  in the Deinococcus sp. 43 genome are shown in bold black text; the flavonoids identified
  in the metabolite detection are shown in colored boxes; the quadrangular box represents
  a specific substance, while the circular box represents a class of flavonoids. Different
  colored boxes represent different flavonoids. Catalytic enzyme genes of the flavonoid
  metabolism pathway are present.
