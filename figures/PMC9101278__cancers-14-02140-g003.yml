caption: Schematic representation of the immune—gut interactions during GI cancer
  and how it influences the inflammatory responses. Due to gut dysbiosis, the low
  level of short chain fatty acids can lead to the activation of inflammatory pathway,
  the production of cytokines and chemokines and the activation of STAT3 and NF-kB
  signaling pathways. “Created with BioRender.com”.
