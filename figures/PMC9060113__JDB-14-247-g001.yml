caption: The pathogenesis of type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) both ultimately
  lead to the decline of β‐cell mass and function. Modulation of PI3K/Akt signalling
  can act as a therapeutic strategy to counteract β‐cell loss. In T1D, autoreactive
  lymphocytes and pro‐inflammatory cytokines (such as IL1β, TNF and IFNγ) drive β‐cell
  destruction. In T2D, β‐cells undergo compensatory expansion and increased insulin
  secretion in response to hyperlipidaemia and insulin resistance in the tissues,
  thus causing β‐cell exhaustion and death. In both conditions, there is a decrease
  in β‐cell mass and insulin secretion. This decline can be counteracted by activation
  of the PI3K/Akt pathway, which has been shown to promote β‐cell proliferation, survival
  and metabolism. Created with Biorender.com
