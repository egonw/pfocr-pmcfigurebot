caption: 'The protective effect of melatonin after isoflurane exposure was mediated
  by the SIRT1/Mfn2/PERK signaling pathway. (A) The relationship of SIRT1, Mfn2 and
  PERK presented with Co-IP. Mfn2 was immunoprecipitated protein. SIRT1 and PERK were
  detected protein. (B) A graph representative of RT-PCR of SIRT1 mRNA expression
  (F(2,15) = 26.860, P < 0.001). (C) A graph representative of RT-PCR of Mfn2 mRNA
  expression (F(2,15) = 77.670, P < 0.001). (D) Western blot bands of SIRT1, Mfn2
  and PERK expression after treatment with SIRT1 siRNA interference lentivirus. (E)
  SIRT1 expression (F(3, 20) = 35.840, P < 0.001) after treatment with SIRT1 siRNA
  interference lentivirus and melatonin. (F) Mfn2 expression (F(3, 20) = 9.076, P
  < 0.001) after treatment with SIRT1 siRNA interference lentivirus and melatonin.
  (G) PERK expression (F(3, 20) = 28.910, P < 0.01) after treatment with SIRT1 siRNA
  interference lentivirus and melatonin. (H) Western blot bands of Mfn2 and PERK expression
  after treatment with Mfn2 siRNA interference lentivirus. (I) Mfn2 expression (F(3,
  20) = 23.500, P < 0.001) after treatment with Mfn2 siRNA interference lentivirus
  and melatonin. (J) PERK expression (F(3, 20) = 41.720, P < 0.001) after treatment
  with Mfn2 siRNA interference lentivirus and melatonin. siSIRT1: primary hippocampal
  neuron with SIRT1 siRNA interference lentivirus group; ncSIRT1: primary hippocampal
  neuron with control null siRNA interference lentivirus group; siMfn2: primary hippocampal
  neuron with Mfn2 siRNA interference lentivirus group; ncMfn2: primary hippocampal
  neuron with control null siRNA interference lentivirus group; Iso + M + siSIRT1:
  primary hippocampal neuron with SIRT1 siRNA interference lentivirus and pre-treatment
  with 5mM melatonin then received isoflurane exposure group; Iso + M + siMfn2: primary
  hippocampal neuron with Mfn2 siRNA interference lentivirus and pre-treatment with
  5mM melatonin then received isoflurane exposure group; Data were presented as mean
  ± SEM (n = 6). ∗denotes p < 0.05, ∗∗denotes p < 0.01, ∗∗∗denotes p < 0.001 when
  comparing the two groups under each end of the capped line.'
