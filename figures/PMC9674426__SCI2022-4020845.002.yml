caption: 'The expression levels of cytokine genes in CH-hMSCs and PL-hMSCs. The expression
  levels of the cytokine genes were determined by qRT-PCR and standardized with the
  expression level of GAPDH of the same sample. CH-hMSCs were derived from 3 donors
  (CH9, CH15, and CH16) and PL-hMSCs were derived from 3 donors (PL11, PL14, and PL17).
  Data are presented as mean ± SEM of three experiments. Abbreviations: DKK1: dickkopf
  WNT signaling pathway inhibitor 1, TGF-β: transforming growth factor-β, IFN-β: interferon-β,
  IFN-γ: interferon-γ, TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor-α.'
