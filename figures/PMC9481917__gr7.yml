caption: Activation of Hedgehog signaling pathway partially rescues aberrant cortical
  neurogenesis(A) Schematic diagram of the treatment of 5 mg/kg SAG from E13.5 to
  E14.5.(B) After the treatment of SAG from E13.5 to E14.5, quantification of western
  blot of GLI1 expression level in E15.5 Eed cKO cortices. n = 3 mice per group.(C)
  Schematic diagram of treatment of 5 mg/kg SAG from E9.5 to E15.5. n = 3 mice per
  group.(D) Representative images and quantification of the projected cortical areas
  of E16.5 Eed cKO and WT mice.(E) Represent images and quantification of the number
  of SATB2+ cells after treatment SAG. Scale bars, 50 μm.(F) Representative images
  and quantification of the projected cortical areas in E16.5 WT, Eed cKO, Ptch1 cKO,
  and Eed cKO/Ptch1 cKO (dcKO) mouse brains. Scale bar, 50 mm; n = 3 mice per group.(G)
  Represent images and quantification of the number of BrdU+ cells in cortices of
  E16.5 Eed cKO and WT mice that were subjected to SAG treatment and to BrdU pulse-chase
  labeling. Scale bars, 50 μm.(H) Representative images and quantification of the
  number of TUJ1+ cells in the cortices of E16.5 WT, Eed cKO, Ptch1 cKO, and dcKO
  mice. Cortices were stained for Pax6 (green), Tuj1 (red) and DAPI (blue). Scale
  bars, 50 μm; n = 3 mice per group. Data are presented as means ± standard error
  of the mean; two-tailed unpaired t-test, n.s., non-significant, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗p < 0.001.
