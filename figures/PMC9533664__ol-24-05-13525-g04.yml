caption: Effect of inhibitors of ERK1/2, JNK1/2/3 and p38 on the activation of ERK1/2,
  JNK1/2/3 and p38 in HCCLM3 cells. HCCLM3 cells were pre-treated with the ERK1/2
  inhibitor U0126, the JNK1/2/3 inhibitor SP600125 or the p38 inhibitor SB203580 for
  60 min, and then the expression levels of (A) ERK1/2, (C) JNK1/2/3 and (E) p38 in
  HCCLM3 cells were analyzed by western blotting. Relative protein level of (B) p-ERK1/2/t-ERK1/2,
  (D) p-JNK1/2/3/t-JNK1/2/3 and (F) p-p38/t-p38 in HCCLM3 cells. The results of the
  densitometric analysis of ERK1/2, JNK1/2/3 and p38 activation were normalized to
  the levels of GAPDH. The data were expressed as the mean ± SD (n=3). *P<0.05 vs.
  the control group. Con A, concanavalin A (10 µg/ml); p, phosphorylated; t, total.
article_title: Concanavalin A inhibits human liver cancer cell migration by regulating
  F-actin redistribution and assembly via MAPK signaling pathway.
