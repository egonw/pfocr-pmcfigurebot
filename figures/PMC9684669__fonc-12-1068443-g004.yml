caption: 'Calcium pathway is important in MDR generation. (A) A volcano plot of the
  genes that were up- and down-regulated in A2780-ADR cells versus A2780 cells. The
  genes are considered significant changes when the p-value is < 0.05 and the fold
  change is > 2-fold. (B) Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that 13
  calcium-related biological pathways were activated in the A2780-ADR cell when compared
  to its parental A2780 cell. (C) Gene-Pathway network showed most of the DEGs were
  clustered in the processes of cytosolic calcium ion transport, homeostasis, and
  response. (D) The KEGG calcium signaling pathway (p < 0.0001) was also exhibited
  the significance in gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). (E) Heatmap: the unsupervised
  hierarchical clustering showed 177 genes regarding calcium pathway showed the perfect
  separation in the GSEA.'
