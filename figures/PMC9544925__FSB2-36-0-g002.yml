caption: IL‐4 prevents apoptosis of human monocytes. (A,B) AnnexinV/7‐AAD staining
  of human monocytes. The colored boxes indicate viable (green), early apoptotic/necrotic
  (yellow), and late apoptotic/necrotic (red) cells (A). Flow cytometry analysis of
  the AnnexinV/7‐AAD staining (B). (n = 5 human donors, ns = not significant) (C,D)
  19 signaling proteins involved in the apoptosis pathway were analyzed in lysates
  of human monocytes treated with 100 ng/ml IL‐4 for 24 h. Red boxes mark significantly
  regulated proteins, green boxes mark normalization controls (C, both images were
  adjusted for brightness and contrast equally). Volcano plot of the protein array,
  proteins of interest are labeled and marked with colors (D). (n = 4 human donors)
  (E) Confocal laser microscopy of the immunofluorescence staining and quantification
  of NFκBp65 in isolated human monocytes either left untreated or treated with 100 ng/ml
  IL‐4 for 24 h; scale bars = 20 μm. A 6× higher magnification of some cells is shown
  in the canvas for each condition. (n = 6 human donors).
