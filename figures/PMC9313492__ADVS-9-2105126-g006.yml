caption: HK2 is highly expressed in liver CSCs and is essential for maintaining their
  stemness and self‐renewal. a) Real‐time qPCR showing HK2 mRNA expression (relative
  to ACTB) in adherent cells and tumorspheres of HUH7 and C3A cells. Data are represented
  as the mean ± SD (n = 3). Unpaired t‐test. b) Western blot measuring HK2 protein
  levels in adherent cells and tumorspheres of HUH7 and C3A cells. ACTIN was detected
  as a loading control. c) Western blot measuring HK2, ALDH1A1, and EpCAM protein
  levels in HUH7 or C3A cells after sorting by FACS with APC‐EpCAM antibody staining.
  ACTIN was detected as a loading control. d) Western blot measuring HK2, ALDH1A1,
  and CD13 protein levels in HUH7 and C3A cells after sorting by FACS with PE‐CD13
  antibody staining. ACTIN was detected as a loading control. e) Immunofluorescence
  images of HK2 and EpCAM (up) and CD13 (down) levels in tumorsphere and adherent
  cells. All scale bars represent 50 µm. f) Western blot measuring CD13, EpCAM, and
  HK2 protein levels in HUH7 cells after HK2 knockdown or HK2 overexpression. Cells
  transfected with the empty vector (pLVTHM or PCDH) were used as a negative control.
  ACTIN was detected as a loading control. g) Tumorsphere formation assay of HUH7
  and C3A cells after HK2 knockdown. Additionally, see the photographs in Figure  (Supporting
  Information). Data are represented as the mean ± SD (n = 2). One‐way ANOVA with
  multiple comparisons correction. h) Tumorsphere formation assay of HUH7 and C3A
  cells after HK2 overexpression. Additionally, see the photographs in Figure  (Supporting
  Information). Data are represented as the mean ± SD (n = 2). Unpaired t‐test. i)
  A serial tumorsphere formation assay of HUH7 (left) and C3A (right) cells after
  HK2 knockdown. Additionally, see the photographs in Figure  (Supporting Information).
  Data are represented as the mean ± SD (n = 2). One‐way ANOVA with multiple comparisons
  correction. j) A serial tumorsphere formation assay of HUH7 (left) and C3A (right)
  cells after HK2 overexpression. Additionally, see the photographs in Figure  (Supporting
  Information). Data are represented as the mean ± SD (n = 2). One‐way ANOVA with
  multiple comparisons correction. k) Limiting dilutions of HUH7 cells after HK2 knockdown
  were subcutaneously injected into BALB/c nude mice to observe tumor growth. Tumor
  sizes and tumor‐free mouse ratios are shown on the left and right, respectively.
  Additionally, see the statistical data‐sheet in Figure  (Supporting Information).
  Tumor‐free mouse ratios were analyzed with simple linear regression. l) Limiting
  dilutions of HUH7 cells after HK2 overexpression were subcutaneously injected into
  BALB/c nude mice to observe tumor growth. Tumor sizes and tumor‐free mouse ratios
  are shown on the left and right, respectively. Additionally, see the statistical
  data sheet in Figure  (Supporting Information). Tumor‐free mouse ratios were analyzed
  with simple linear regression. ns, non‐significant, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p
  < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.
