caption: ON resulting from MOG-induced EAE. Representative sections of the visual
  pathway including the optic nerve, optic chiasm, and optic tract in naïve (A) and
  EAE mice at the peak disease stage (B) and chronic stage (C). Each section was stained
  with DAPI (a marker of nuclei, blue) (N = 6). The insets show the optic nerve (1),
  optic chiasm (2), and optic tract (3), respectively. Note that EAE was mainly associated
  with meningeal inflammation of the pia mater during the peak disease stage in the
  visual pathway compared with naïve mice. Scale bar = 500 μm.
