caption: MBOP is degraded by the ubiquitin–proteasome system. (A) Cells treated with
  MG132 exhibited higher protein expressions of MBOP compared to other groups, indicating
  the possibility of involvement of the ubiquitin–protease system in the degradation
  process of MBOP. (B) The expressions of MBOP and the dose of MG132 showed a positive
  correlation. (C) Two E3-ligase enzymes RMND5A and MAEA were found in MBOP interacting
  candidate proteins in , and the siRNAs targeting RMND5A and MAEA were validated
  in HCT116. Knockdown of RMND5A and MAEA all decreased the degradation rate of MBOP.
  Data are presented as mean ± SD, **** p < 0.0001. (D) IP assay showed the direct
  interaction between MBOP and MAEA, rather than with RMND5A, which indicated that
  MAEA directly, while RMND5A indirectly, mediated the degradation of MBOP. The expressions
  of input MBOP in two IP assays were too low to be seen compared to those of the
  anti-MBOP groups.
