caption: 'Pan-cancer analysis revealed the expression levels and prognostic value
  of SH3TC2 in human cancers. (A) Comparison of SH3TC2 expression in tumor tissue
  and normal tissue in the TCGA database. The red-highlighted cancer names indicate
  significance (p < 0.05). The abbreviations can be found in . (B) Comparison of SH3TC2
  expression in tumor tissue and normal tissue in the GEPIA database. The red-highlighted
  cancer names indicate that SH3TC2 is differentially expressed in tumor tissue and
  normal tissue based on screening of the GEPIA and TCGA databases. (C) Comparison
  of SH3TC2 expression in tumor tissue and normal tissue in specific cancers, including
  COAD, READ, SKCM, and TGCT. Analysis revealed that SH3TC2 is upregulated in CRC
  (COAD and READ) and SKCM but downregulated in TGCT. (D) Prognostic analysis of the
  GEPIA database revealed that high SH3TC2 expression is correlated with poor DFS
  in CRC patients. No statistical significance was found in SKCM and TGCT. (E) Analysis
  of the TNMplot database, TCGA database, and 7 GEO datasets indicated that SH3TC2
  is upregulated in tumor tissue in CRC. Statistical analysis was compared to the
  control or normal groups: * p < 0.05; *** p < 0.001.'
