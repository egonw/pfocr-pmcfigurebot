caption: 'TSPEAR-AS2 regulates GLUT1 via the IGF2BP2 pathway. (a) The subcellular
  localization experiment showed the localization of TSPEAR-AS2 in BC cells. (b) Observation
  of the effect on the mRNA expression of GLUT1 after knockdown TSPEAR-AS2. (c) Observation
  of the effect on the mRNA expression of GLUT1 after knockdown TSPEAR-AS2. (d) mRNA
  stability experiment verifies the effect of TSPEAR-AS2 on the stability of GLUT1
  mRNA. (e) RIP experiment verifies the interaction between TSPEAR-AS2 and GLUT1.
  (f) The JASPAR database shows the promoter binding site of C-myc. âˆ—P < 0.05 compared
  with the negative control. #P < 0.05 compared with the si-TSPEAR-AS2 group.'
