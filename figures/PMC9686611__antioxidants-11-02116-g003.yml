caption: Neuroprotective effects of physical activity. Regular exercise is demonstrated
  to decrease oxidative stress and inflammation as well as increase the release of
  anti-inflammatory molecules, including IL-4 and IL-10. In addition, exercise triggers
  the PGC-1α/FNDC5 pathway in skeletal muscles, with the consequent release of Irisin,
  which is fundamental for the increase in neurotrophic factors. PA improves astrocyte
  functions with positive effects on hippocampal and vascular activities. In addition,
  exercise seems able to restore the AMPK and the JNK-BCL2 autophagy, preventing the
  accumulation of misfolded proteins and ensuring mitochondrial turnover. Exercise
  also acts on cell apoptosis and brain aging, restoring Wnt/β-Catenin signaling.
  Finally, PA enhances the release of dopamine improving brain functions in patients
  suffering from PD. The figure was created in BioRender.com, accessed on 18 September
