caption: 'CDCA8 silencing reversed the promotion of KIF18B overexpression on ESCC
  cell migration and invasion. Both EC9706 and KYSE220 cells were transfected with
  KIF18B overexpression plasmids or/and siCDCA8. (A–C) After transfections, the biological
  function of CDCA8 in cell migration was measured by wound healing assays. Original
  magnification, 100×. Scale bar: 50 μm. (D–F) Transwell assays were subsequently
  performed for detecting cell invasion. Original magnification, 200×. Scale bar:
  50 μm. All experiments had gone through three repetitions. **p < .01, ***p < .001
  versus Vector; #p < .05, ##p < .01, ###p < .001 versus KIF18B + Vector. CDCA8, cell
  division cycle associated 8; KIF18B, kinesin family member 18B'
article_title: Upregulation of KIF18B facilitates malignant phenotype of esophageal
  squamous cell carcinoma by activating CDCA8/mTORC1 pathway.
