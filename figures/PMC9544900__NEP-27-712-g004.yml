caption: Peptide 17 reduces SBP and modulates biochemical parameters of kidney injury
  in hypertensive rats. (A) Body weight. (B) Ratio of kidney weight/body weight. (C)
  Creatine content in plasma. (D) NGAL in plasma. (E) Urine volume. (F) Albumin content
  in urine. (G) Albumin content in urine. (H) NGAL in urine. (I) SBP in different
  groups. The one‐way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparison posttests was
  performed. For A‐H, *p < .05 compared with WKY group; the significance difference
  for other group comparisons is reported in the figure panels. For I, * in orange
  indicates p < .05 in the comparison of SHR + ctrl siRNA with WKY, * in red indicates
  p < .05 in the comparison of SHR with WKY, * in green indicates p < .05 in the comparison
  of SHR+ peptide 17 with SHR, * in black indicates p < .05 in the comparison of SHR+
  YAP siRNA with SHR. The results were obtained from six rats/group
