caption: Connection between YAP signaling and Autophagy. lncRNA ATB and SKIL can promote
  autophagy via YAP signaling. YAP signaling promotes autophagy through regulation
  of HMGB1, ATG5. On the other hand, YAP signaling inhibits autophagy via bcl-2, and
  PTEN/AKT pathway. YAP signaling could regulate carcinogenesis and chemosensitivity
  via autophagy.
