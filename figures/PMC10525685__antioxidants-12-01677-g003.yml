caption: 'Effect of SBE on Nrf2 and Keap1 mRNA and protein expression levels in cells.
  GAPDH was used as an internal control. (A) Expression of NFE2L2 gene; (B) Expression
  of KEAP1 gene; (C) Western Blot analysis of Nrf2 and keap1; (D) Expression of Nrf2
  protein; (E) Expression of Keap1 protein. The values are expressed as the mean ±
  SD (n ≥ 3 per group). Significance between groups was analyzed using one-way ANOVA
  (compared with the control group, #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01; compared with the model
  group, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001).'
