caption: Confirmation of the optimal concentrations of LPS, DMOG and BAY 87-2243 for
  Caco-2 cells. (A-B) Effect of different concentrations of LPS on the viability of
  Caco-2 cells and the optimal concentration of LPS for this study was 600ug/ml. (C)
  Effect of different concentrations of DMOG on the viability of Caco-2 cells. (D)
  Effect of different concentrations of DMOG on the expression of HIF-1α in Caco-2
  cells. (E) Effect of different concentrations of BAY 87-2243 on the viability of
  Caco-2 cells. (F) Effect of different concentrations of BAY 87-2243 on the expression
  of HIF-1α in Caco-2 cells. Optimal concentrations for DMOG and BAY 87-2243 were
  104 nM and 10 nM respectively. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001
