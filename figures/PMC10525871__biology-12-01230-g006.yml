caption: REACTOME pathway enrichment analysis of genes on the brown and blue modules.
  (a) A bubble plot indicating the enrichment of 97 genes of the brown module in the
  top 20 REACTOME signaling pathways. Labels of the Y-axis show the pathways, and
  the X-axis corresponds to the gene ratio (number of input genes/number of all genes
  involved in the pathway). The color of the bubble indicates the enrichment significance,
  and the size of the bubble represents the number of genes enriched in the pathway.
  (b) Same as in (a). The plot displays the enrichment of 138 genes of the blue module
  in the top 20 REACTOME signaling pathways. Labels of the Y-axis show the pathways,
  and the X-axis corresponds to the gene ratio (number of input genes/number of all
  genes involved in the pathway). The color of the bubble indicates the enrichment
  significance, and the size of the bubble represents the number of genes enriched
  in the pathway. (c) A heatmap of 97 genes of the brown module that are enriched
  in the top 20 REACTOME signaling pathways. A colored cell indicates that the genes
  (X-axis) are enriched in the corresponding pathway (Y-axis). (d) A heatmap of 138
  genes of the blue module that are enriched in the top 20 REACTOME signaling pathways.
  A colored cell indicates that the genes (X-axis) are enriched in the corresponding
  pathway (Y-axis). A p-value < 0.05 and an FDR (adjusted p-value) < 0.01 were considered
  statistically significant for all cases.
