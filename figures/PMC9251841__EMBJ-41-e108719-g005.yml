caption: PhosTag‐based Western blot probed for YAP reveals no changes in YAP phosphorylation
  levels in HEK293A and 143B cells in response to static 500 mbar hydrostatic pressure
  (+) compared to control (−).Western blot showing LATS1 and LATS2 levels in WT and
  LATS1/2 DKO cells.Western blot showing NF2 expression level in WT and NF2 KO cells.Western
  blot showing TEAD expression level in WT and TEAD KO cells.Western blot showing
  YAP, TAZ and CYR61 levels in 143B YAP KO and TAZ KO cells relative to WT.143B WT,
  YAP KO and TAZ KO response to 100 mbar cyclic hydrostatic pressure as measured by
  DHM. Each dot represents a single cell from three independent experiments and error
  bars represent mean ± 95% CI. Mann–Whitney U test. ***P < 0.001 (WT vs. YAP KO),
  ***P = 0.006 (WT vs. TAZ KO).Steady‐state volume of Y/T DKO relative to WT YAP and
  S94A mutant YAP re‐expressing Y/T DKO cells as measured by DHM. Each dot represents
  a single cell from three independent experiments and error bars represent 95% CI.
  Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s post‐hoc. P > 0.999 (vector vs. WT YAP), P = 0.2173
  (vector vs. S94A YAP) and, P = 0.9837 (WT YAP vs. S94A YAP).Western blot showing
  total YAP, TAZ and CYR61 levels in WT TAZ re‐expressing cells compared to WT and
  Y/T DKO vector control.Steady‐state cell volume WT TAZ re‐expressing cells relative
  to Y/T DKO as imaged and analysed by DHM. Each dot represents a single cell from
  three independent experiments. Error bars represent mean ± 95% CI. Mann–Whitney
  U test. ***P < 0.001.Average change in cell volume in response to hydrostatic pressure
  in WT TAZ re‐expressing cells relative to Y/T DKO as imaged and analysed by DHM.
  Each dot represents a single cell from three independent experiments. Error bars
  represent mean ± 95% CI. Mann–Whitney U test. ***P < 0.001.Candidate genes conferring
  YAP/TAZ‐mediated cellular response to hydrostatic pressure. Gene expression levels
  of HEK293A WT cells in response to 0.1 Hz, 200 mbar cyclic hydrostatic pressure
  (4 h) compared with steady‐state levels within each genotype and analysed by RT–qPCR.
  Graphs show data obtained from four independent experiments. Error bars represent
  mean ± SD. Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s post‐hoc.Gene expression level induced
  by hydrostatic pressure in Y/T DKO#1 cells normalized to WT levels. Graphs show
  data obtained from four independent experiments. Error bars represent mean ± SD.
  Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s post‐hoc.Gene expression level induced by hydrostatic
  pressure in Y/T DKO#2 cells normalized to WT levels. Graphs show data obtained from
  four independent experiments. Error bars represent mean ± SD. Kruskal–Wallis test
  with Dunn’s post‐hoc.  Source data are available online for this figure.
