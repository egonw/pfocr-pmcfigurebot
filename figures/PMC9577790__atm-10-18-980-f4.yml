caption: 'Isoliquiritin induces the apoptosis of HMC1.1 cells by inhibiting CD177
  (C-KIT)/JAK2/STAT signaling. (A,B) Western blotting was employed to quantify the
  protein expression of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax. (C,D) Western blotting was employed
  to quantify the protein expression of p-JAK2, p-STAT3, p-C-KIT, p-STAT1, and p-STAT5.
  In this figure, results are the mean ± SD; one-way ANOVA; Data in bar charts are
  the mean ± SEM of 3 independent experiments [*P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 vs. control
  group; #P<0.05, ##P<0.01, ###P<0.001 vs. calcium ionophore A23187/phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate
  (P/A) group)]. ISO, isoliquiritin; DEX, dexamethasone; SD, standard deviation; ANOVA,
  Analysis of Variance; SEM, standard error of mean.'
