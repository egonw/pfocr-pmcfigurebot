caption: '(a) Acute pain transmission pathway: Acute pain follows a three-neuron sensory
  pathway in which peripheral neurons travel from receptors through the dorsal root
  ganglion into the spinal cord. The spinal neurons then cross and rise through the
  spinothalamic tract to the thalamus, where they synapse with a third neuron and
  then reach the somatosensory cortex, generating a feeling of pain; (b) Pathophysiological
  classification of pain: Acute pain (no more than 3 months) and chronic pain (more
  than 3 months).'
