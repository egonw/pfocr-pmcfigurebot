caption: HCRP-1 overexpression inhibits oral squamous cell carcinoma cell migration
  and invasion. Effects of HCRP-1 overexpression on cell migration and invasion were
  assessed using (A) wound healing (scale bar, 100 µm) and (B) Transwell (scale bar,
  50 µm) assays. (C) Protein expression levels of MMP9 and MMP14 were determined via
  western blotting. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001. HCRP-1, hepatocellular carcinoma-related
  protein 1; Ov-, overexpression; NC, negative control.
article_title: HCRP-1 alleviates the malignant phenotype and angiogenesis of oral
  squamous cell carcinoma cells via the downregulation of the EGFR/STAT3 signaling
  pathway.
