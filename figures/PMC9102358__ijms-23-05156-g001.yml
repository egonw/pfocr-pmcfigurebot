caption: 'Influence of RNase 7 on UPEC infection in bladder cells in a high-glucose
  environment. SV-HUC-1 cells were pretreated with different concentrations of RNase
  7 (1, 5, and 25 μg/mL) and 15 mM glucose for 24 h and then infected with pGFP-UPEC
  (MOI:1:100) as described in the text. UPEC infection in bladder cells was examined
  by plating on LB agar (A) and determined using ImageJ software (B). Colony-forming
  units (CFUs) were acquired after plating out lysed solutions of infected cells.
  The definitions of each letter/number represented by the X axis are: U: UPEC infection
  alone; G: with 15 mM glucose pretreatment alone; 1, 5, and 25: pretreated with 1,
  5, and 25 μg/mL RNase 7, respectively, + 15 mM glucose. Data are expressed as the
  mean ± SD of three independent experiments. ** p < 0.01, compared to UPEC infection
  control groups. #### p < 0.0001, compared between the two groups.'
