caption: SIRT3 KD inhibits SAL-mediated neurite and mitochondrial protection. A IF
  of Tuj1 (green) shows neurite morphology in Naïve and SIRT3KD SH-SY5Y cells with
  indicated treatment. Nuclei counterstained with DAPI. B Quantification of neurite
  length of A. C IF of TOM20 shows mitochondrial morphology in neurites of SIRT3KD
  SH-SY5Y cells with indicated treatment. Orange arrows, healthy mitochondria; white
  arrows, damaged mitochondria. Quantitation of images in C shows the length of mitochondrial
  segments (D) and mitochondrial density (E). F Fluorescence images show the intensity
  of aggregates (red) and monomers (green) of JC-1 staining in naïve and SIRT3KD cells
  with indicated treatment. G Quantification of JC-1 ratio of intensity in F. H Images
  show the fluorescence intensity of DCFH (ROS indicator) in cells with indicated
  treatment. I Quantitation of fluorescence intensity in H. Error bars indicate mean ± SD.
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001; n.s., not significant; one-way ANOVA test.
