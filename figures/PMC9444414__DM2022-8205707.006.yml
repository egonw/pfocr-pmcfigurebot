caption: NF-κB inhibition counteracted the protective effect of α-cyperone on OGD-mediated
  myocardial injury. After treatment of OGD-induced cardiomyocytes with α-cyperone
  (60 μM) for 24 hours, the NF-κB inhibitor Bay 11-7082 was added. (a) Cardiomyocyte
  viability was assayed with CCK-8. (b) Cardiomyocyte apoptosis was examined by flow
  cytometry. (c) Expression of apoptosis-associated proteins was gauged by WB. (d)
  qRT-PCR assessed the relative expression of inflammatory factors. (e) Expression
  of inflammatory response proteins was monitored by WB. (f) MDA levels and SOD activity
  were checked by the colorimetric assay. (g) ROS production was gauged using a ROS
  assay kit. All experiments were repeated three times and data are expressed as mean
  ± SD; ∗P < 0.05 (vs. OGD), ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
