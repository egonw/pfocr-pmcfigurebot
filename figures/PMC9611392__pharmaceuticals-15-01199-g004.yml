caption: Rap1/PI3K-Akt signaling pathway correlates with Gemcitabine-resistance in
  PDAC cells. (A) Schematic of the differentially expressed gene discovery in Gem-R
  PDAC cells using GSE148200 and GSE140077. (B) Venn-diagram of up- and down-regulated
  expression (log2FC > ±1.0 and p < 0.01) of the genes in Gem-R PDAC cells. (C,D)
  Scatter plot of KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of up- (C) and down-regulated (D)
  genes in Gem-R PDAC cells. The number of differentially expressed genes in the pathway
  is indicated by the circle area, and the circle color represents the range of p
  value. (E) qRT-PCR analysis of key differentially expressed genes of Rap1/PI3K-Akt
  signaling pathway in parental and Gem-R PDAC cells. β-Actin mRNA expression was
  used as an internal control. The average (column) ± SD is indicated (* p < 0.05
  vs. parental). Gem-R, Gemcitabine-resistant; PDAC, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma;
  BBR, Berberine; Gem, Gemcitabine; FC, fold change; SD, standard deviation.
