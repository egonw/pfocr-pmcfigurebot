caption: “QN” agarwood mitigates renal injury in diabetic mice. A Schematic study
  framework. B A representative sample of kidneys was selected from each group. C
  Kidney-to-Body Weight Ratios (mg/g). D Albuminuria (mg/24 h). E Serum creatinine
  (µmol/L) was measured. F BUN (mmol/L). G Representative images of renal tissue stained
  with H&E were captured, Scale bar = 40X.###p < 0.001 versus CON group; *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 versus DKD group. n.s indicates no statistically significant
  difference
