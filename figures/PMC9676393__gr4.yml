caption: Pathway analysisPyrimidine metabolism, carnitine synthesis, and histidine
  metabolism were among the top significantly enriched pathways.(A) Diagram demonstrating
  a simplified version of the pyrimidine metabolism pathway and the detection of each
  metabolite in our analyses. Scatterplots of 3 of the significantly altered metabolites
  in adenomyosis that demonstrate the enrichment of the pyrimidine metabolism pathway
  (5,6-dihydrothymine, thymine, N-carbamoylaspartate) color coded by superpathway.
  Line represents the mean. P- and q-values are shown.(B) Diagram demonstrating a
  simplified version of the carnitine synthesis pathway and the detection of each
  metabolite in our analyses. Scatterplots of 3 of the significantly altered metabolites
  in adenomyosis that demonstrate the enrichment of the carnitine synthesis pathway
  (N6,N6,N6-trimethyllysine, succinate, deoxycarnitine) color coded by superpathway.
  Line represents the mean. P- and q-values are shown.(C) Diagram demonstrating a
  simplified version of the histidine metabolism pathway and the detection of each
  metabolite in our analyses. Scatterplots of 3 of the significantly altered metabolites
  in adenomyosis that demonstrate the enrichment of the histidine metabolism pathway
  (4-imidazoleacetate, formiminoglutamate, histamine) color coded by superpathway.
  Line represents the mean. P- and q-values are shown. Green arrows indicate metabolites
  that were significantly upregulated (p<0.05). Bold text represents metabolite shown
  in scatterplots. Dashed arrows indicate multiple steps in pathway.
