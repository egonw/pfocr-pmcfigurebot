caption: rNfCB induces production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in BV-2 microglial
  cells. (a) mRNA expression. BV-2 microglial cells were treated with different concentrations
  (20 µg/mL or 100 µg/mL) of active and heat-inactivated rNfCB. Cells were harvested
  at 6 h after treatment. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed to analyze expression
  patterns of cytokines (TNF-α, IL1-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) and iNOS. Bar graphs indicate
  the quantitative expression profile of each gene, represented as -fold induction
  of each gene relative to GAPDH in three independent experiments. (b) Quantitative
  ELISA. BV-2 microglial cells were treated with different concentrations (20 µg/mL
  and 100 µg/mL) of rNfCB for different time points (6 h, 9 h, or 12 h). Heat-inactivated
  rNfCB was administered to the cells for 12 h. At indicated time points, the supernatant
  was collected and protein levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were analyzed via ELISA. Values
  were presented as mean ± SD of three independent experiments. One-way ANOVA with
  Dunnett’s post hoc test was performed as multiple comparisons with the negative
  control without treatment, with either LPS or rNfCB. *** p < 0.0001, ** p < 0.001,
  * p < 0.01.
