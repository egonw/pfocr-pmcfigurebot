caption: Heatmaps of genes having a significant expression variation in at least one
  mutant background. The gene names are indicated on the left side of each heatmap
  (Toll pathway and Imd/Imd-JNK pathways). For each infected (I) or uninfected (UI)
  experimental condition, downregulated genes are colored in red, while the upregulated
  genes are indicated with blue. The white squares indicate that the expression variation
  was not statistically significant. The gene expression is expressed as log2FC.
