caption: 'Exogenous GRP78 blocks the pro-apoptotic GRP78/eIF2α/CHOP/caspase-3,9 signaling
  pathway of the UPR in nigral tissue in a rat model of Parkinson’s disease. Nigral
  content of (a) GRP78, (b) phosphorylated to total eIF2α, (c) CHOP. (d) Representative
  immunoblots. Nigral content of (e) cleaved caspase-9, (f) cleaved caspase-3. (g)
  Representative immunoblots. Western blot analysis of the nigral tissue was conducted
  with the antibodies against GRP78 (1:1000, rabbit, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), eIF2a
  (1:750, rabbit, Affinity Biosciences, Zhenjiang, China), pSer51-eIF2a (1:1000, rabbit,
  Abcam, Cambridge, UK), CHOP (1:1000, rabbit, Affinity Biosciences, Zhenjiang, China),
  cleaved caspase-9 (1:1000, rabbit, Affinity Biosciences, Zhenjiang, China), and
  cleaved caspase-3 (1:1000, rabbit, Affinity Biosciences, Zhenjiang, China). Staining
  with anti-β-Actin antibodies (1:1000, mouse, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX,
  USA) was used as the loading control. The results are presented as percentages of
  the control (panels (a–c,e,f)). Bar charts indicate mean values with standard errors.
  The dots, squares, triangles and rhombus indicate individual values per rat. Two-way
  ANOVA test followed by Tukey’s post hoc analysis were performed to determine the
  effects of GRP78 therapy. Asterisks indicate significant differences between groups
  according to Tukey’s post hoc tests: * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01. *** p < 0.001, vs.
  the vehicle group; # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, vs. the LC group. Interaction factor
  for GRP78 F (1, 20) = 8.83 p = 0.0076; Grp78 treatment factor F (1, 20) = 7.413
  p = 0.0131; LC (lactacystin) factor F (1, 20) = 15.89 p = 0.0007. Interaction factor
  for p-eIF2a/eIF2a ratio F (1, 19) = 5.68 p = 0.0278; Grp78 treatment factor F (1,
  19) = 1.874 p = 0.1869; LC factor F (1, 19) = 7.819 p = 0.0115. Interaction factor
  for CHOP F (1, 16) = 3.126 p = 0.0961; Grp78 treatment factor F (1, 16) = 3.672
  p = 0.0734; LC factor F (1, 16) = 47.898 p = 0.0418. Interaction factor for cleaved
  caspase-9 F (1, 17) = 4.124 p = 0.0582; Grp78 treatment factor F (1, 17) = 1.513
  p = 0.2355; LC factor F (1, 17) = 5.911 p = 0.0264. Interaction factor for cleaved
  caspase-3 F (1, 17) = 6.417 p = 0.0214; Grp78 treatment factor F (1, 17) = 5.646
  p = 0.0295; LC factor F (1, 17) = 7.451 p = 0.0143.'
