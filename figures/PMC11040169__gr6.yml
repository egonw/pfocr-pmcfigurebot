caption: Synergistic effect of genistein and adiponectin on ERβ signal and lipid metabolism-related
  factors expression in chicken hepatocytes. The LMH cells were treated with vehicle,
  250 ng/mL APN, and 40 μM GEN individually or in combination for 24 h. (A) Triglyceride
  content (n = 6); (B) Immunoblot of ERα, ERβ, Nampt, and ACTB protein; (C–D) The
  protein levels of ERα, ERβ and Nampt (n = 3); (E) Immunoblot of SIRT1, p-AMPK, t-AMPK,
  p-ACC, t-ACC and ACTB protein; (F–H) The protein levels of SIRT1, p-AMPK/t-AMPK
  and p-ACC/t-ACC (n = 3). Data are expressed as means ± SEM. * P < 0.05 and ** P
  < 0.01, comparison with the respective control groups.
