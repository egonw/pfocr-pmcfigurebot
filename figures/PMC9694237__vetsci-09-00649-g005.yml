caption: 'Effects of blocking the mTOR pathway on the secretion of PGs by STCs after
  hormone treatment: (A) Relative mRNA levels of prostaglandin synthases in rapamycin
  (Rap)-pretreated STCs were determined by real-time fluorescence quantification.
  The β-actin gene was used as the control in all samples. (B) After blocking the
  mTOR pathway, the secretion of PGE2 and PGF2α was measured by ELISA, and the ratio
  of PGE2/PGF2α was calculated. Data are shown as the mean ± standard deviation (SD)
  of three independent trials. Different letters above the bars indicate significant
  differences (p < 0.05).'
