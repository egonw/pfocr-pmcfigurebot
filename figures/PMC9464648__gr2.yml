caption: 'The brief sorting mechanism of exosomal miRNA and uptake by recipient cellsThe
  biogenesis of miRNA involves transcription of a pri-miRNA, formation of pre-miRNA,
  translocation to the cytoplasm, and maturation of the miRNA. miRNAs containing different
  RNA motifs can be loaded into multivesicular bodies (MVBs) via different RNA-binding
  proteins. MVBs can either follow a degradation pathway fusing with lysosomes or
  release the intraluminal vesicles as exosomes to the extracellular space. Recipient
  cells can uptake exosomal miRNAs by three pathways: direct fusion, endocytosis,
  and receptor signaling.'
