caption: 'SETD8 regulates several genes from the p53 signal pathway. (A) Multidimensional
  scaling plot between individual RNA-seq. Distances between individuals correspond
  to the leading BCV. HEC1B and HEC50B cells treated with negative control siRNA (n
  = 3) are shown in gray and black, respectively. HEC1B and HEC50B cells treated with
  four SETD8-targeting siRNAs are shown in red and blue, respectively. (B) MA plots
  showing differentially expressed genes (DEGs: false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05,
  red dots) between HEC50B cells treated with negative control (n = 3) and SETD8-targeting
  siRNA (n = 4). The differentially expressed SETD8 is indicated by the arrow (green
  dot). Black lines indicate the log2 fold change (logFC) at 1 and âˆ’1. Average logCPM:
  the average log2 count per million. Circle plot shows the number of DEGs. (C) Relationships
  between enriched pathways. Pathway enrichment analysis for DEGs (FDR < 0.05, logFC
  > 1, n = 1552) in SETD8 knockdown HEC50B cells. For pathway enrichment analysis,
  Gene Ontology networks were generated using ClueGO and Cytoscape as described in
  the method section. (D) Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) of DEGs in SETD8-knockdown
  HEC50B cells. PPIs were visualized using Cytoscape with string database. First neighbors
  of TP53 are shown (FDR < 0.05, logFC > 1, n = 175). Top score of first neighbors
  of TP53 are shown. (E) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis for genes with upregulated
  expression (n = 1552) in SETD8-knockdown HEC50B cells. Dot plot showing GeneRatio
  (ratio of input genes that were annotated in a term) in the x-axis and terms sorted
  by GeneRatio in the y-axis. The adjusted p-value (p.adjust) is displayed as a gradient
  from red to blue. The number of counts is indicated by the size of the black circle.
  The common pathways identified in (C,E) are highlighted with red squares. (F) Gene
  Ontology analysis of molecular function for upregulated genes (n = 1552) in SETD8-knockdown
  HEC50B cells.'
