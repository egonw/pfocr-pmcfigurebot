caption: Generation and validation of the Ripk2104Asp mouse. (A) Schematic illustration
  of the mouse Ripk2 locus and detailed view of exon 2. CRISPR/Cas9-stimulated homology
  directed repair was used to edit sequences of C57Bl/6J mice (WT) encoding the Ripk2104Asn
  protein to generate an isogenic line that expressed the OA-associated Ripk2104Asp
  protein from the native locus. The guide RNA target sequence is underlined, the
  PAM site is highlighted in blue, and the Cas9 cleavage site is denoted with lightning
  bolt. An oligonucleotide donor was used as a template to create the mutations to
  generate Asp 104 (red) as well as silent mutations (magenta) to prevent targeting
  of the modified locus. (B) Immunoblot analysis indicates similar Ripk2 protein present
  in WT and Ripk2104Asp splenocytes or bone marrow derived macrophages (BMM). Gapdh
  is used as a loading control. M = protein mass standards in kDa. (C) A single copy
  of Ripk2104Asp is sufficient to alter the gene expression response of primary chondrocytes
  to MDP treatment. Volcano plots indicate genes significantly upregulated (red) or
  downregulated (blue) in MDP-treated Ripk2104Asp as compared to MDP-treated WT primary
  chondrocytes. (D and E) Increased gene expression in response to MDP stimulation
  is dependent on Ripk2 activity. D) WT or E) Ripk2104Asp primary chondrocytes were
  stimulated with MDP in the presence or absence of the Ripk2 inhibitor, WEHI-345.
  Volcano plots indicate genes significantly upregulated (red) or downregulated (blue)
  upon MDP-stimulation in the presence of the inhibitor.
