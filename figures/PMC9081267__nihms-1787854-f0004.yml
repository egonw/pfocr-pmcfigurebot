figure_title: Microbial diversity and composition in humanized mice identify specific
  microbial taxa predicative of PA status and metabolic pathway differences
caption: a, Mice humanized with high PA, low PA PI-IBS and healthy volunteer microbiota
  have differences in microbiota composition (n=6 human feces/phenotype, dots represent
  average). b, Humanized mice intra-group, not inter-group relatedness. Humanized
  mice microbiota are compositionally and taxonomically different when compared to
  each other, but similar within its group (Bray-Curtis, PERMANOVA with 999 permutations,
  p=0.001). c, Alpha diversity across humanized mice. Healthy volunteer and low PA
  humanized mice have greater species richness compared to high PA humanized mice
  (n=6 human feces/phenotype, dots represent average, linear regression on observed
  species **p=0.01,***p=0.002). d, Beta diversity measures in humanized mice. Microbial
  composition differs between each humanization state (Bray-Curtis, PERMANOVA with
  999 permutations, p=0.01). e, Higher level taxonomic evaluation of engrafted microbiota
  in humanized mice (n=6 human feces/phenotype, dots represent average). f-g, Volcano
  plot(s) highlighting strain level differences between high PA and healthy volunteer
  (f) or high and low PA PI-IBS humanized mice (g). Red icons indicating differences
  in abundance (q<0.1) with A. putredinis identified (n=6 human feces/phenotype, dots
  represent average). h, Prediction model of microbiota for PA status by random forests.
  The top 10 taxa predictive of PA status in mice assessed using mean decrease in
  accuracy. i, Predicted KEGG pathway differences between high PA and healthy volunteer
  humanized mice. Differentially abundant KEGG pathways with q<0.1. Effect size denotes
  average difference in KEGG functional unit between reference and comparison groups.
  Boxplots as previously described.
