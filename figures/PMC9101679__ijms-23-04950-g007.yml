caption: Scatter plot of enrichment factors in the KEGG pathways of DEGs. (a) KEGG
  enrichment bubble map. The blue box indicates the response to external stimuli and
  plant hormone signal transduction. The red box indicates the pathway of flavonoid
  synthesis. (b) KEGG enrichment bubble map of downregulated DEGs. (c) KEGG enrichment
  bubble map of upregulated DEGs. GR indicates the green region of the leaf, and YG
  indicates the yellow-green region of the leaf.
