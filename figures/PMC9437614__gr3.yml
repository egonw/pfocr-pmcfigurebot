caption: siRNA-mediated knockdown of PRV-responsive phosphoproteins in the MAPK signaling
  pathway. A PK-15 ​cells were transfected with specific siRNAs against NF-κB, ATF2,
  MAX, and SOS, and gene transcription was detected by real-time PCR. Individual gene
  expression was normalized to a non targeted control siRNA (negative control). B
  Cell lysate was loaded onto 1 ​× ​SDS-PAGE gel and the interference efficiency of
  siRNA was analyzed by Western blot. Negative control siRNA was set as the loading
  control (100%). The normalized relative protein amount was quantified by densitometry
  scanning (ImageJ2x) and GAPDH was used as the internal control. C The effect of
  siRNA on PRV titer was quantified by plaque assay. D The effect of siRNA on PRV
  genome copy number was quantified by qRT-PCR. ∗P ​< ​0.05; ∗∗P ​< ​0.01; ∗∗∗P ​< ​0.001;
  n.s., not significant.
