caption: Urothelial bladder cancer (UBLCA) cells are extremely sensitive to microtubule
  assembly inhibition. (A) Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screens of 32 BLCA cell lines.
  Each circle represents a gene. The x-axis represents the mean difference of the
  CHRONOS dependency scores in BLCA cell lines compared to all the other ones. Negative
  dependency scores indicate that BLCA cells require that gene, whereas positive scores
  suggest that the gene suppresses BLCA growth. Blue-colored circles represent significant
  negative dependencies, and of the top dependencies, KATNB1 is colored orange. Statistical
  significance was calculated as −log10 (p-value) from two-sided t-tests with Benjamini–Hochberg
  correction. (B) Two class comparisons for KATNB1; one of the most significant dependencies
  highlighted in (A) between the 32 BLCA cell lines compared to all other cell lines
  in DepMap (n = 1063). (C) Gene ontology analysis of the 49 genes enriched as statistically
  significant dependencies in BLCA cells in (A). Only pathways with FDR < 0.05 are
  shown. (D) PRISM drug sensitivity results for paclitaxel are depicted as log2-fold
  changes in abundance of barcoded cells at d5 vs. d0. The results for bladder (urinary
  tract) cancer cells are shown compared to breast, ovarian (fallopian tube), lung,
  and kidney cancers. Breast, ovarian, and lung cancers are among the most sensitive,
  and paclitaxel is currently used as a standard of care. In contrast, kidney cancer
  cells are among the least sensitive and are depicted as controls. (E,F) Representative
  dose–response curves for paclitaxel in BLCA (RT4) and kidney cancer (CAL54) cell
  lines. T-statistic and p-value were obtained from the DepMap portal.
