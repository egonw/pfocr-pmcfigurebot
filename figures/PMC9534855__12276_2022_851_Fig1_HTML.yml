figure_title: The Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitor CXXC5 was induced in the liver tissues
  of patients and mice with NASH
caption: a Gene set enrichment analysis of microarray transcriptome data for normal
  and NASH patients for the Wnt/β-catenin signaling-activated gene signature. Black
  columns indicate 83 enriched genes involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
  in the liver tissue of obese patients with all stages of NASH and controls (NASH,
  n = 18; control, n = 14). NES normalized enrichment score, ES enrichment score,
  FDR false discovery rate. b Hierarchical clustering and heatmap of RNA-seq data
  in liver tissues from morbidly obese patients with NASH (Normal, n = 4; NASH, n = 4).
  The color scale shows Z score fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped
  reads representing the mRNA levels of each gene in the blue (low expression) to
  red (high expression) color scheme. c–e Representative images of CXXC5 and β-catenin
  expression in human liver (c), HFD + CCl4− (d), and HFD + GTG-induced NASH mouse
  (e) tissues. Graphs in the bottom panels represent quantitative analyses of IHC
  staining for correlation of the expression of cytosolic CXXC5 and β-catenin with
  the NAS using covariance in the liver tissues from normal and NASH human subjects
  (Normal, n = 5; NASH, n = 12), those from NCD and HFD + CCl4-induced mice (NCD,
  n = 12; HFD + CCl4, n = 12), and those from NCD and HFD + GTG-induced mice (NCD,
  n = 8; HFD + GTG, n = 8). Scale bars, 100 µm. f, g Relative mRNA expression of Cxxc5
  and Wnt/β-catenin signaling target genes (Tcf7l2, Glp-1, Axin2, Fosl1, and Wisp1)
  in the livers of NCD- and HFD + CCl4-induced NASH mice (NCD, n = 12; HFD + CCl4,
  n = 12) (f) and NCD- and HFD + GTG-induced NASH mice (NCD, n = 8; HFD + GTG, n = 8)
  (g). Data represent the mean ± SD. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001 determined
  by Student’s t test.
