caption: 'HMM promotes the apoptosis of lumbar intervertebral disc tissue through
  FasL. (a) Representative images of the results of the expression of FasL in nucleus
  pulposus cells, assessed by immunohistochemistry (40x). Black arrows indicate positive
  staining, and blue arrows indicate negative staining. Scale bar = 50 μm. (b) Representative
  images of TUNEL staining (40x) in the nucleus pulposus cells. Scale bar = 50 μm.
  (c) The expression levels of C-caspase-3, C-caspase-8, and C-caspase-9 in nucleus
  pulposus cells were detected by western blotting. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P
  < 0.001 vs. the normal group; ##P < 0.01 and ###P < 0.001 vs. the LDH group; and
  ΔP < 0.05 and ΔΔP < 0.01 vs. the HMM group.'
