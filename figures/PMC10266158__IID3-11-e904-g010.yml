caption: 'Effects of EPI on the inflammatory response of adriamycin‐induced nephropathy
  rats. CON: control. (A) The level of macrophages in kidney tissue was measured by
  flow cytometry. (B) The level of neutrophils in kidney tissue was measured by flow
  cytometry. (C, D) The levels of IL‐10 and TGF‐β1 in the serum were measured by ELISA.
  (E–H) The levels of IL‐1β, TNF‐α, MCP‐1, and IL‐6 in kidney tissue were measured
  by RT‐qPCR. (I) The NF‐κB signaling pathway‐related proteins were measured by western
  blot analysis. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD, n = 3 or 8 rats per group, *p < .05,
  **p < .01 compared with the ADR group. ADR, adriamycin‐induced nephropathy; EPI‐H,
  Epimedium sagittatum Maxim high dose group; EPI‐L, Epimedium sagittatum Maxim low
  dose; H&E, hematoxylin and eosin; mRNA, messenger RNA; PA, prednisone; TGF, transforming
  growth factor; TNF, tumor necrosis factor.'

  by restraining inflammation and apoptosis via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
