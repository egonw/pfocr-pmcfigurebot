caption: L. lactis MG1363-pMG36e-GLP-1 inhibited ferroptosis via potentiating the
  Keap1-Nrf2-GPX4 pathway in PD model mice. (a) Ultrastructure of mitochondria in
  SN of PD model mice as measured by TEM; the red box and arrow indicated mitochondria
  (scale bar = 2.0 μm or 500 nm). (b) Perls’ staining image of SN in PD model mice;
  the black arrow indicated iron deposition (scale bar = 50 μm). (c) Western blotting
  of TfR1, DMT1, and β-actin in SN. (d,e) Relative quantification of TfR1 and DMT1
  protein levels adjusted to internal reference β-actin (n = 4). (f) Representative
  photomicrographs of GPX4 in the SN of PD mice as measured by IF staining (scale
  bar = 50 μm). (g) Representatives Western blotting of GPX4, Keap1, Nrf2, and β-actin
  in the SN. (h–j) Quantification of GPX4, Keap1, and Nrf2 protein levels adjusted
  to β-actin (n = 4). (k) Representative Western blotting of FSP1, ACSL4, and β-actin
  in the SN. (l,m) Relative quantification of FSP1 and ACSL4 protein levels adjusted
  to β-actin (n = 4). * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01.
