caption: 'LINC00460 was associated with the gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic ductal
  adenocarcinoma cells (PDAC). (A) Relative expression level of LINC00460 was detected
  by qRT‐PCR (local chemotherapy cohort, n = 20; drug measure of response: PD (progressive
  disease); SD (stable disease); PR (partial response); CR (complete response)). (B)
  The correlation between high/low LINC00460 level and gemcitabine response was analyzed
  using Fisher''s exact test. (C) Schematic to generate gemcitabine‐resistant primary
  human PDAC for PDX studies. PDX (P1) tumors were grafted subcutaneously to BALB/c
  mice for the gemcitabine‐resistance model (P2–P4). Once tumor volume reached 150 mm3,
  mice were treated with gemcitabine 50 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection twice weekly
  until tumor growth relapsed (approximately 6 weeks), indicating drug resistance.
  (D) Relative expression level of LINC00460 in PDX tumor cells of the gemcitabine‐resistant/control
  model was detected by qRT‐PCR. (E) Heatmap of 734 differentially expressed genes
  in shControl (cyan) versus shLINC00460 (purple) (356 downregulated and 378 upregulated
  (n = 4 and 8; all absolute fold change >2 or ≤2, p‐value < 0.01). (F) GO annotation
  using genes whose differential expression is significant. (G) GSEA results showed
  that cytokine‐mediated signaling pathway and growth factors were activated when
  LINC00460 was knocked down.'
