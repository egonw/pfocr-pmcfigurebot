caption: 'RET promotes acute inflammatory response involution-associated gene expression.
  (A) RNA-sequencing data analysis of mammary glands from lactation day 10 (L10) DOX-induced
  Ret/MTB females (L10 ret/MTB DOX) or control Ret/− and MTB/− females (L10 Ret/−,
  MTB/− DOX) in comparison to virgin (V) DOX-treated control Ret/− animals (V Ret/−
  DOX) is presented as a Venn diagram of the number of differentially expressed (DE)
  genes. P≤0.01; P-values were calculated as implemented in R (n=6 L10 Ret/MTB mice,
  n=3 L10 Ret/− and n=3 L10 MTB/− mice, n=4 V Ret/– mice). (B) Gene set enrichment
  analysis (GSEA) was carried out using publicly available sets (MSigDB). GSEA shows
  the correlation with the gene sets upregulated with more than 120 genes in size
  between the top ten oncogenic pathways: top three (3) EGFR_UP.V1_UP, top six (6)
  AKT_UP.V1_UP and top nine (9) AKT_UP_MTOR_DN.V1_UP, in the six Ret/MTB in contrast
  to the six control 10 day-lactating glands (Ret/−, MTB/−). The bottom-right GSEA
  shows the correlation between the top (1) canonical pathway, REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING,
  in the same conditions. Peaks or valleys that occur on the edges represent pathways
  differentially regulated by RET overexpression. NES, normalized enrichment score;
  q, false-discovery rate. P-value was computed as implemented in GSEA. (C) IHC for
  p-S10H3 staining and the corresponding quantification was performed on sections
  of mammary glands of Ret/MTB or control (Ret/−, MTB/−) DOX-induced females on lactation
  day 10 (L10). Data are presented as the mean±s.e.m. Scale bars: 50 μm. (D) Volcano
  plot showing gene expression of RET-expressing bitransgenic mammary glands (Ret/MTB,
  n=6) compared with control mammary glands (Ret/−, n=3 and MTB/−, n=3) from 10 day-lactating
  females on DOX treatment (L10 Ret/MTB DOX versus L10 Ret/−, MTB/− DOX). Black dots
  correspond to the 149 significantly deregulated genes (P≤0.01); at the bottom, the
  non-significant genes are shown as gray dots. Gene symbols of the most significantly
  upregulated genes are indicated [Log2(fold change)≥1.5; –Log10(P)≥2.5; P≤0.01].
  From the literature, we highlighted genes by color code that are Stat3 (or Stat1)
  regulated in mammary epithelium. Genes described as post-partum-associated high
  breast cancer risk are indicated by asterisks.'
