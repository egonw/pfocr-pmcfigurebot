caption: 'Effects of coconut oil on oxidative stress in artificial particulate matter
  (APM) and diesel exhaust particles (DEP)−stimulated alveolar macrophages (MH−S).
  (A,B) Cytotoxicity assessment of distilled water (DW) and coconut oil the 3–(4,5–dimethylthiazol–2–yl)–2,5–diphenyltetrazolium
  bromide (MTT) assay. (C) Cytotoxicity assessment of coconut oil in APM and DEP−stimulated
  MH−S. (D) Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was measured using 2′,7′−dichlorofluorescein
  diacetate (DCF−DA) staining. Data represent the mean ± SD (n = 8 per group). (E)
  NADPH dehydrogenase (quinone) (NQO1) gene level was measured using real−time PCR.
  (F) Glutathione (GSH), (G) glutathione disulfide (GSSG), (H) GSSG/GSH ratio, and
  (I) Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) levels in MH−S. Negative
  controls (NC) are untreated samples. Vehicle control (VC) was treated with cell
  medium including 10% DW. Data are presented as the means ± SD of three independent
  experiments. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 or *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001 vs. NC or
  VC; ## p < 0.01 or ### p < 0.001 vs. APM group; §§ p < 0.01 or §§§ p < 0.001 vs.
  DEP group.'
