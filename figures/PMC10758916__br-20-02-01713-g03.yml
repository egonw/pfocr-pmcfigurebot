caption: Bubble diagram of metabolic pathways. Groups (A) A3 vs. P and (B) groups
  A7 vs. A3. In the bubble diagram, every bubble represents a metabolic pathway. The
  abscissa and bubble size represent the impact factor of the path in topology analysis.
  The larger the bubble size is, the greater the impact factor is. The vertical coordinate
  of the bubble and bubble color represent the P-value of enrichment analysis. P,
  before intervention; A3, after intervention on day 3; after intervention on 7.
