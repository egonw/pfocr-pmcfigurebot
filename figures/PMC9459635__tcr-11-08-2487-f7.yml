caption: Ubenimex renders GC-resistant cells sensitive to 5-FU by alleviating the
  activity of the CD13/EMP3/FAK/NF-κB pathway. (A) SGC7901/5-FU cells were pretreated
  with ubenimex (0.12 mg/mL) and pTZU-CD13-shRNA both for 24 h, followed by incubation
  with 5-FU at increasing concentrations (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 16, 32 µg/mL) for another
  48 h. (B) SGC7901/5-FU cells were pretreated with ubenimex (0.12 mg/mL) and pTZU-CD13-shRNA
  both for 24 h, followed by incubation with 5-FU (12 µg/mL) for 0–72 hours. Cell
  viability was determined by the CCK-8 method. The results are expressed as the means
  ± SD of three replicates. *P<0.05 and **P<0.01. OD, optical density; 5-FU, 5-fluorouracil;
  Ube, ubenimex; EMP3, epithelial membrane protein 3; FAK, focal adhesion kinase;
  NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; CCK-8, Cell Counting Kit-8; SD, standard deviation.
