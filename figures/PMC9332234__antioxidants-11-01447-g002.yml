caption: Peripheral contributions to oxidative and inflammatory responses after stroke.
  This figure illustrates the bidirectional inflammatory and oxidative signaling between
  the damaged central nervous system tissue and peripheral organs, such as the spleen,
  lymph nodes, and bone marrow. The Nrf2 pathway can mitigate this exacerbated response
  via its antioxidative protein products.
