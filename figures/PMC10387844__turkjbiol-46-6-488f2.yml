caption: 'Transcriptomics analyses of cisplatin-treated HeLa cells. Total RNAs were
  isolated from three biological replicates of HeLa cells treated with 80 μM cisplatin
  and 0.1% DMSO as explained in . The sequencing library was generated by the poly(A)
  capturing method and then sequenced with HiSeq 2500. Raw sequences were processed
  with the following tools in conda environment; quality check by FastQC, adapter
  trimming by Trim Galore!, rRNA contamination removal by SortMeRNA, reference genome
  alignment by STAR and read counting by featureCounts. Then the count matrix was
  subjected to differential expression analysis by DESeq2 in R. Only statistically
  significant ones (p < 0.05) were used for further analyses. (A) Heatmap of top 1000
  differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in DMSO control and cisplatin-treated HeLa
  cells. (B) Volcano-plot of RNA-seq data analysis. (C) Reactome pathway analysis
  of differentially expressed protein-coding genes in cisplatin-treated HeLa cells.
  First 30 pathways were taken into account based on the GeneRatio values. (D,E) Reactome
  pathway analyses of other metabolic pathways associated with DEGs in cisplatin-treated
  HeLa cells and signal transduction pathways associated with metabolism-related DEGs,
  respectively. (F) qPCR analyses of differentially expressed metabolism-related genes.
  1000 ng of RNA were used for cDNA synthesis and GAPDH was used for normalization.
