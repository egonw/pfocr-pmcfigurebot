caption: Overexpression of TP53INP2 led to inhibitions on the cellular migration and
  the cellular invasion of ccRCC cell lines. Both wound healing experiment (a)–(f)
  and transwell assays (g)–(j) were for the verification on the efficacy of TP53INP2
  overexpression on migrative and invasive capabilities of 786-O, ACHN, and A498 cell.
  (k)–(n) Levels of epithelial marker E-cadherin and mesenchymal marker (Ncadherin
  and vimentin) in TP53INP2-overexpressed cells were measured with western blot. Data
  were presented as mean ± SD of three or four independent experiments. ∗P < 0.05;
  ∗∗P < 0.01; ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
