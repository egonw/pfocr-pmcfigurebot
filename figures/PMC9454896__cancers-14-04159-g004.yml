caption: SNHG1 bound to DNMT3A protein and promoted the interaction of DNMT3A with
  the miR-129-2 promoter, thereby hyper-methylating and inhibiting the transcription
  of miR-129-2. (A) T24T(Vector) and T24T(SNHG1) cells were incubated with Act-D for
  0, 10, and 20h. Total RNA was isolated and then subjected to quantitative real-time
  PCR to determine miR-129-5p levels. (B) Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out
  to determine the expression of pre-miR-129-2 in the indicated cells. (C) The methylation
  status of the miR-129-2 promoter in the differentially methylated region (DMR) was
  determined using a methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR) assay. Two primer sets were
  used to evaluate the methylated (M) and unmethylated (U) copies of the miR-129-2
  DMR gene. Methylated DNA was used as the positive control (P), while unmethylated
  DNA was used as the negative control (N). PCR products represented the methylated
  state and unmethylated allele. (D, Left panel) Total protein extracts from the indicated
  cells were extracted and subjected to Western blotting for DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B,
  with β-Actin as a loading control. (D, Right panel) Relative protein levels determined
  by densitometry and expressed as ratios versus β-Actin. (E) RNA-IP was carried out
  to examine the specific interaction of SNHG1 with DNMT3A. GAPDH was employed as
  a negative control. (F) ChIP assays were performed to determine DNMT3A binding to
  the miR-129-2 promoter in T24T(Vector) and T24T(SNHG1) cells (see Materials and
  Methods for details). (G,H) CRISPR/Cas9 specifically targeting DNMT3A was stably
  transfected into T24T(SNHG1) cells. The cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting
  to determine DNMT3A and Rac1 protein expression (G), and the isolated RNAs were
  subjected to quantitative real-time PCR to evaluate miR-129-5p levels (H). (I,J)
  The indicated cells were subjected to a stem-like sphere formation assay. Representative
  images of formed spheres were captured under microscopy (I), and the number of spheres
  f was counted and presented as sphere formation relative to T24T(SNHG1/Vector) cells
  (J). (K,L) T24T(SNHG1/Vector) cells and T24T(SNHG1/KO-DNMT3A) cells were subjected
  to a transwell invasion assay, and migration and invasion abilities were calculated
  and presented in terms of relative motility to the T24T(SNHG1/Vector) control. The
  results are presented as means  ±  SD from at least triplicate experiments, and
  asterisks (*) indicate a significant decrease in comparison to T24T(SNHG1/Vector)
  cells (p  <  0.01). Bars in (I) are equal to 200 μM and equal to 100 μm in (K).
