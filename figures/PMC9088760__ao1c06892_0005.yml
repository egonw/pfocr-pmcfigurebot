caption: 'After BMSCs were cocultured with GOQDs at different concentrations, the
  effects of GOQDs on mineralization were detected. (A) Alizarin-red-stained image
  and (B) alizarin-red-stained calcium nodule image (represented by red arrows). Scale
  bars, 500 μm. (C) Semiquantitative detection of calcium nodules and (D) microscopic
  images of ALP staining. Scale bars, 200 μm. (E) Quantitative detection of ALP activity
  (*p < 0.05, ***p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001, compared with 0.1 μg/mL GOQDs; #p < 0.05,
  ##p < 0.01, and ###p < 0.001, compared with control).'
