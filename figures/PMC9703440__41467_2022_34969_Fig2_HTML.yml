  activity-dependent manner
caption: a Schematic outline of in vitro plasma cell (iPC) differentiation from splenic
  naïve B cells. Flow cytometry analysis of the percentage of iGCB cells (CD19+FashiGL7hi)
  at day 4 and iPCs (CD19+CD138+) at day 8 of culture, and supernatant IgG1 and IgE
  of p38α KO and WT B cells at day 8 of iPC culture were measured by ELISA (n = 6
  per group). b Principal-component analysis (PCA) of RNA-seq data from sorted iGCB
  cells (n = 2 per group), iPCs (CD19+CD138+) and CD138− B cells (CD19+CD138−) of
  indicated genotypes (n = 3 per group). Numbers of upregulated (red) and downregulated
  (blue) genes (p value < 0.01) in p38α KO iGCB cells and iPCs in comparison with
  WT cells. c Purified splenic naïve B cells from p38αfl/flVavcre or p38αfl/fl mice
  (CD45.2+) were mixed and co-cultured with CD45.1+ WT splenic naïve B cells at a
  1:1 ratio. Flow cytometry analysis of iPCs gated on CD45.1+ and CD45.2+ B cells
  in iPC differentiation system at day 8 of culture (n = 3 per group). d Immunoblot
  analysis of p38α, p-p38α, IgG heavy (H)-chain and Actin in cultured p38α KO and
  WT B cells at indicated time points after being transferred onto IL-21 feeder cells.
  e Cultured p38α KO and WT B cells were transduced with retroviruses encoding p38α
  and p38α kinase-dead mutants (K53M or T180A/Y182F) at day 2 of iGCB cell differentiation.
  iPCs among retrovirus-transduced B cells (CD19+GFP+CD138+) were analyzed by flow
  cytometry 6 days after retroviral transduction (n = 6 per group). Protein levels
  of p38α, IgG heavy (H)-chain and Actin in retrovirus-transduced B cells were analyzed
  by immunoblot. Data were representative of at least three independent experiments
  (a), (c–e). Each symbol represents a representative sample. Small horizontal lines
  indicate the mean (±s.d.). Data were analyzed by two-tailed unpaired t-tests. Source
  data are provided as a Source Data file.
