caption: 'SAL-mediated cognitive protection is dependent on SIRT3. A A schematic overview
  shows the workflow of our animal study. B Quantitation shows the escape latency
  of mice from indicated groups from day 1 to day 5 during training. Significant differences
  are found in 5×FAD group compared to WT (**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001) or 5×FAD+SAL
  group (##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.01). C Representative trajectories of mice from each
  group in MWM tests at day 6. Red square, starting point; blue square, ending point;
  platform (red circle) located in quadrant 2. Quantitation shows the traveled distance
  (D) and time spent (E) in the platform located quadrant. F Representative heatmap
  images show the visit frequency of mice in Y-maze. Arrow, the novel arm. Quantification
  shows the times of entry (G) and traveled distance (H) in the novel arm. All data
  are represented as mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, n.s., not significant;
  n ≥ 6; one-way ANOVA'
