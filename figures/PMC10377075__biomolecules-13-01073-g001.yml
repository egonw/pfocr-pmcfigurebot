caption: Schematic diagram of microfluidic chip structure. (A) Physical diagram of
  microfluidic chip. (B) Schematic diagram of 6-channel chip. The numbers I- VI represent
  that this chip is a six-channel chip. Among them, I, II and III channels were the
  control group, and IV, V and VI channels were the 30 s experimental group. (C) Single-channel
  loading unit. ① Chemokine injection port. ② Cell culture solution injection port.
  ③ Waste liquid outlet. ④ Cell injection port. ⑤ Chemokine transport channel. ⑥ Cell
  culture medium delivery channel. ⑦ Cell transmission channel. ⑧ Waste liquid channel.
  ⑨ Cell isolation zone.
