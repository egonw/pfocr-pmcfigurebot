caption: CircNDST1 promotes thyroid cancer migration and invasion through EMT. A Effect
  of circNDST1 on the migratory invasion ability of TPC1 cells assessed by Transwell
  assay(scale bar:100 μm). B Effect of circNDST1 on the migratory invasion ability
  of KTC1 cells assessed by Transwell assay(scale bar:100 μm). C Effect of circNDST1
  on the migratory capacity of TPC1 cells assessed by wound healing assay(scale bar:100 μm).
  D Effect of circNDST1 on the migratory capacity of KTC1 cells assessed by wound
  healing assay(scale bar:100 μm). E Effect of circNDST1 knockdown on EMT essential
  protein expression in TPC1 cells detected by Western blot. F Effect of circNDST1
  knockdown on EMT essential protein expression in KTC1 cells detected by Western
  blot. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. Data are shown as SD ± mean
article_title: CircNDST1 promotes papillary thyroid cancer progression via its interaction
  with CSNK2A1 to activate the PI3K–Akt pathway and epithelial–mesenchymal transition.
