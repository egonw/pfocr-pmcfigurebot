caption: Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype Is Associated With COVID-19 Severity
  and Cardiac Involvement(A) Unsupervised clustering of the 80 patient plasma samples
  based on principle component 1 (PC1). (B) Venn diagram displaying overlapping pathways
  associated with increasing COVID-19 disease severity in the discovery and validation
  cohorts. In the discovery cohort, enrichment analysis was done with PC1 proteins
  (). In the validation cohort, pathway analysis was performed using Day 0 proteomic
  profiles regressed on maximum World Health Organization disease severity per patient
  (). (C) Heat maps displaying differential expression of the 50 most significantly
  regulated genes in the SASP-1 or -2 gene sets in lungs from hamsters infected with
  SARS-CoV-2 vs naive control subjects. Tissue samples were collected 4 days after
  infection. n = 3/group. SASP = senescence associated secretory phenotype.
