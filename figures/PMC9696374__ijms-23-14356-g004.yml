caption: 'Effects of AKR1C3 knockdown on androgen signaling induced by Adione or 11KAdione
  in 22Rv1 cells. The cells were treated with Adione (A–C) or 11KAdione (D,E) 24 h
  after transfection with AKR1C3 siRNA (si-3 or si-4), DHRS11 siRNA (si-1, si-2) or
  universal negative siRNA (Neg) and incubated for another 24 h. Treatment with the
  AKR1C3 inhibitor, HITCC, was performed 2 h before the treatment with Adione. (A,B,D)
  PSA expression. The mRNA expression levels of PSA analyzed by RT-qPCR. ** p < 0.01,
  * p < 0.05, NS p > 0.05 denotes significantly different from the cells treated with
  DMSO alone. ## p < 0.01, # p < 0.05 denotes significantly different from the cells
  treated with 10 nM Adione or 11KAdione alone. (C,E) Nuclear expression of AR (green),
  Ki67 (red) and DNA (blue) were visualized by immunofluorescence using the antibodies
  against AR and Ki67 and DAPI, respectively. Merged images are also shown. Scale
  bar indicates 20 μm.'
