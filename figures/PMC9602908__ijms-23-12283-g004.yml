caption: 'Exposure to BPA, BPAF and PDTC destabilized the viability and apoptosis
  of prostate cells. Effect of exposure to gradient BPA and BPAF on the viability
  of WPMY−1 (A) and HPrF (B). Effect of BPA and BPAF combined with the inhibitor of
  NF-κB (PDTC) on the viability of WPMY−1 (C) and HPrF (D). Apoptosis of WPMY−1 (E)
  and HPrF (F) that were treated with BPA, BPAF and PDTC. Results are performed as
  means ± SD, analyzed using ANOVA followed by LSD post hoc test, n = 3. Comparison
  of the individual administration group and the control: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01;
  comparison of the combined administration group and the individual administration
  group: ## p < 0.01. Quadrant 1: mechanically damaged cells; quadrant 2: FITC+/PI+,
  late apoptosis of cells; quadrant 3: FITC−/PI−, normal cells; quadrant 4: FITC+/PI−,
  early apoptosis of cells. WPMY−1: human normal prostate stromal immortalized cell
  line; HPrF: human prostate fibroblasts.'
