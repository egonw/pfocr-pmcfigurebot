caption: Byakangelicol inhibited TiP-induced polarization of macrophages toward the
  M1 phenotype in vitro. (A and B) Western blot and quantitative analysis showing
  levels of iNOS and ARG1 after 24 h intervention with TiPs and RANKL. (C) RT-PCR
  analysis of the mRNA expression levels of iNOS and ARG1. (D–F) Representative images
  and quantitative analysis of immunofluorescence staining; red (iNOS and ARG1), green
  (F-actin) and blue (nuclei). Scale bar = 50 µm. (G) RT-PCR analysis of the mRNA
  expression levels of IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 after intervention with TiPs and RANKL.
  (H and I) Western blot and quantitative analysis showing levels of IL-1β, TNF-α
  and IL-6 after intervention with TiPs and RANKL. Scale bar = 50 µm. The data were
  represented as mean ± SD of 3 independent experiments. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01.
