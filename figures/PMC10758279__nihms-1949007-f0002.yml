caption: NT3 employs different signaling pathways to activate Rac1. Schematic representation
  of the signaling pathways used by NT3 and BDNF to activate Rac1. NT3 binding to
  TrkC.Kin induces Rac1 activation by recruiting and activating Ras and sub-sequently
  Tiam1. When binding to TrkC.T1, NT3 causes the recruitment of tamalin to the TrkC.T1
  cytoplasmic domain. In turn, tamalin activates the guanine nucleotide exchange factors
  cytohesin-2/ARNO (), which causes the switch of Arf6 to its active form. Activated
  Arf6 induces Rac1 activation and is translocated to the membrane where ruffling
  and actin reorganization take place. Arrow thickness indicates the level of activity
  of a specific pathway (the thickest, the highest) to underline that the level of
  Rac1 activation may be lower by TrkB.Kin when binding its nonpreferred ligand NT3
  instead of its high-affinity ligand BDNF.
