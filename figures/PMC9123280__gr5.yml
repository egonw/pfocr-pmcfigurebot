caption: LIF alleviates hepatic lipid accumulation via LIFR.A, Western blot analysis
  expression of STAT3 pathway in HepG2 cells transfected with LIFR siRNA or NC siRNA
  for 48 h and treated with recombinant LIF protein (10 ng/ml) or PBS for 0.5 h. B
  and C, cellular TG contents (B) and expression of genes involved in de novo synthesis
  (C). HepG2 cells were transfected with LIFR siRNA or NC siRNA for 48 h, treated
  with HG (30 mM) plus insulin (100 nM) for 24 h, with recombinant LIF protein (10 ng/ml)
  or PBS for 1.5 h. n = 3 per each group. Data are presented as mean ± SD. ∗p < 0.05;
  ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p < 0.001. HG, high-glucose; LIF, leukemia inhibitory factor; LIFR,
  LIF receptor; NC, nitrocellulose; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3; TG, triglyceride.
