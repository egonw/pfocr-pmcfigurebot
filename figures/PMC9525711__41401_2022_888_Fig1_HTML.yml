figure_title: TLB rescued cognitive impairement and Aβ burden in APP/PS1 mice
caption: 'TLB at doses of 4 or 8 mg/kg was administered to APP/PS1 mice or age-matched
  WT mice (starting from 6 months old) for 3 months. a Experimental procedures for
  TLB administration. The MWM, Y-maze and NOR were performed for determining the learning
  and memory abilities of mice in different groups. b Escape latency (n = 10 or 11).
  c Representative track images of mice in the probe test. d The number of crossing
  platform (n = 10 or 11). e Time spent in the target quadrant. f Alternation rates
  (%) in the Y-maze task (n = 10 or 11). g Discrimination index in the NOR test (n = 10
  or 11). h Swim speed (n = 10 or 11). i Representative images of thioflavin S staining
  in hippocampus. j Quantification of the areas of Aβ plaques (n = 5). Analysis of
  transcriptomics. k The fold change of DEGs of WT vs. APP/PS1 and APP/PS1 + TLB vs.
  APP/PS1 were summed up using volcano Plot. l The number of different and overlapped
  DEGs from WT vs. APP/PS1 and APP/PS1 + TLB vs. APP/PS1 were summed up using venn
  diagram. m Analysis of KEGG pathway. n PPI network was generated by Cytoscape 3.6.0.
  The size of respective node indicated the degree of connectivity in PPI network.
  Larger node (HMGB1, TLR4, NF-κB) shares more connection to other nodes. Scale bar = 500 μm.
  The data were presented as the mean ± SEM. **P < 0.01 vs. WT group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01
  vs. APP/PS1 group.'
