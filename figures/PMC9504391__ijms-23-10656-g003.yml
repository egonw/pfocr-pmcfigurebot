caption: Overexpression of OsABT regulates Na+ and K+ levels under salt stress. (A–C)
  Na+ content, K+ content, and K+/Na+ ratio in the roots of two–week–old OsABT–OE
  lines (OE–3 and OE–4) and wild type (WT) plants exposed to salt stress (200 mM NaCl)
  for 0, 12, and 24 h. (D,E) Expression of OsSOS1 and OsHAK5 in the roots of two–week–old
  OsABT–OE line (OE–3) and WT plants. Root RNA was isolated and used for quantitative
  real–time polymerase chain reaction (qRT–PCR). Actin was used as an internal control.
  The relative expression levels were represented by fold change relative to the expression
  of WT before salt treatment (0 h). Data are means ± SD of three independent experiments.
  Asterisks indicate significant differences compared to WT plants at * p < 0.05 and
  ** p < 0.01 (Student’s t–test).
