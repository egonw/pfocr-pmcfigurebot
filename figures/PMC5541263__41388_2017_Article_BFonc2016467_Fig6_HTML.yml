caption: 'ATRA directs breast cancer cell state changes and decreases breast CSCs
  through suppression of PKCζ. (a) Schematic showing CSC division patterns: AD, SD
  or SC patterns. (b) Representative confocal fluorescence images showing intracellular
  distribution of CD44 (red) and NUMB (green), in the dividing CD24−CD44hi cells isolated
  from T47D cells using paired cell analysis (scale bar: 10 μm). (c) Protein expression
  levels of PKCζ and p-NUMB in T47D cells that ectopically expressed PKCζ or the control
  vector and treated with 10−6 M ATRA or vehicle for 24 h and (d) the percentages
  of these cells that manifested AD, SC and SD division patterns (n=700–1000 randomly
  selected cells from three independent experiments, asterisk indicates P<0.05). (e)
  Protein expression levels of PKCζ and p-NUMB in T47D-sh-TET2 cells that were treated
  with PKCζ pseudo substrate inhibitor (25μM), ATRA (10−6M), ATRA with PKCζ inhibitor
  or vehicle for 24 h, and (f) the percentages of these cells that manifested AD,
  SC and SD division patterns (n=700–1000 randomly selected cells from three independent
  experiments, asterisk indicates P<0.05). (g) Protein expression levels of PKCζ and
  p-NUMB in MDA-MB-231 cells that were treated with PKCζ pseudo substrate inhibitor
  (25 μM), ATRA (10−6M), ATRA with PKCζ inhibitor or vehicle for 24 h, and (h) the
  percentages of these cells that manifested AD, SC and SD division patterns (n=700–1000
  randomly selected cells from three independent experiments, asterisk indicates P<0.05).
  (i) The number of the serially passaged tumor spheres (sphere size >100 μm) per
  1000 initially plated T47D cells that ectopically expressed PKCζ or the control
  vector and treated with 10−6M ATRA or vehicle for 24 h (n=3 independent experiments,
  asterisk indicates P<0.05). (j) The number of the serially passaged tumor spheres
  (sphere size>100 μm) per 1000 initially plated T47D-sh-TET2 cells that were treated
  with PKCζ pseudo substrate inhibitor (25 μM), ATRA (10−6M), ATRA with PKCζ inhibitor
  or vehicle for 24 h (n=3 independent experiments, asterisk indicates P<0.05, double
  asterisk indicates P<0.01). (k) The number of the serially passaged tumor spheres
  (sphere size>100 μm) per 1000 initially plated MDA-MB-231 cells that were treated
  with PKCζ pseudo substrate inhibitor (25 μM), ATRA (10−6M), ATRA with PKCζ inhibitor,
  or vehicle for 24 h (n=3 independent experiments, asterisk indicates P<0.05, double
  asterisk indicates P<0.01). Comparable amount of control vector and vehicle were
  included as negative control (−) in each group. Error bars denote ±s.d.'
