caption: 'Effects of ALK4 on TGF-β protein stability and transcriptional activity
  in the H9C2 cells experiencing I/R injury. (a) CHX was used to inhibit protein synthesis.
  The cells were lysed and total proteins were extracted for Western blotting with
  anti-TGF-β antibody. (b) Coimmunoprecipitation assay of Ub protein expression. (c)
  Luciferase report assay was carried out to assess the transcriptional activity of
  TGF-β promoter. Data are presented as mean ± SD. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P
  < 0.001, ALK4-NC+I/R group vs. ALK4-NC group. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, and ###P <
  0.001, ALK4-KO+I/R group vs. ALK4-NC+I/R group.'
