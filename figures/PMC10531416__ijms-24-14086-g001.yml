caption: A histogram displays the relative abundance of rhizosphere bacteria (a) and
  fungi (b) in sugarcane under varying CRF conditions at the phylum level. The histogram
  depicts the distribution of the Top20 metabolic pathways of rhizosphere soil metabolites
  annotated according to the KEGG database (c), and the length of the columns corresponds
  to the number of metabolites annotated to the pathway. The percentage represents
  the proportion of metabolites within a specific pathway to the total number of annotated
  metabolites.
