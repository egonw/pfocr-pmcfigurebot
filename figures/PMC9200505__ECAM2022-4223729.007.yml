caption: 'Effects of FHD on body weight, kidney weight, proteinuria, and inflammatory
  response in NS rats via affecting PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. (a) The body weight
  of rats was recorded once every 4 weeks after treatment. (b) The right kidney index
  (kidney weight/body weight) of rats. (c) The level of 24 h urine protein in rats
  was measured using a BCA kit. (d-f) The levels of serum inflammatory factors (IL-1β,
  MCP-1, and TGF-β1) in rats were measured by the corresponding enzyme-linked immunosorbent
  assay kits. NS model rats were induced by adriamycin (ADR) and then treated with
  low- (1 g/kg/d), mid- (2 g/kg/d), high-dose (4 g/kg/d) FHD or/and 740Y-P (a PI3K
  activator). ∗∗∗P < 0.001 compared with the control group; ##P < 0.01 and ###P <
  0.001 compared with the model group; &P < 0.05 and &&&P < 0.001 compared with the
  low-FHD group; and ∆∆P < 0.01 and ∆∆∆P < 0.001 compared with the FHD + 740Y-P group.'
