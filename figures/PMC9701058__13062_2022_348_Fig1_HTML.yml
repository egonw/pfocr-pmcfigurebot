caption: Analysis of the CXCL1 expression profile in the five GEO databases (GSE41328,
  GSE106582, GSE25070, GSE156355, and GSE113513). a Venn diagram showing the commonly
  differentially expressed genes in colorectal cancer; b total symbols of the overlapping
  down-regulated and up-regulated genes; c CXCL1 mRNA expression between normal tissues
  and colorectal cancer tissues. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001
