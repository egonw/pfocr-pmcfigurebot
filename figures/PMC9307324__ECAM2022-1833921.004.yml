caption: Effects of JDNW on D-galactosamine (D-GaLN)-induced cell damage and reactive
  oxygen species production in L02 cells. (a, b). The Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) test
  was used to analyze cell viability. (a) Cells were treated with different concentrations
  of D-GaLN (30, 45, 60, 70, and 90 mM) and (b) pretreated with different concentrations
  of JDNW serum (2.5%, 5%, and 10%) for 12 hours and then cotreated with D-GaLN (45 mM)
  for 11 hours. (C–I) Flow cytometric analysis of ROS levels in L02 cells. (c) ROS
  statistics, (d) control group, (e) Rosup group, (f) D-GaLN (45 mM) group, (g) cotreated
  with JDNW (5%) and D-GaLN (45 mM) group, (h) cotreated with GLY (1 mM) and D-GaLN
  (45 mM), (i) aggregate results. Each bar represents the mean ± SD of n = 3 (∗p <
  0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, “ns” p > 0.05).
