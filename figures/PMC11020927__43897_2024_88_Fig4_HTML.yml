caption: Potential anthocyanin regulatory pathway of red or pink petals in R. chinensis.
  a The metabolites were identified by LC_MS in ‘CH’ and ‘OB’ petals. Peak 1–3 represent
  cyanidin-3,5-diglucoside, pelargonidin-3,5-O-diglucoside and cyanidin-3-glucoside,
  respectively. b Proposed biosynthetic pathway of anthocyanin synthesis in rose.
  c The different 35S:RcMYB114b transgenic lines of rose turned red. d Expression
  of RcMYB114b (left) and anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway genes (right) in different
  35S:RcMYB114b transgenic lines of rose callus. The bars indicate the SD. Stars mean
  significant differences (*** represents P < 0.001, ** represents P < 0.01, * represents
  P < 0.05) analyzed by one–way ANOVA. e. LC–MS analysis of 35S:RcMYB114b transgenic
  rose callus and control. Peak 1–3 represent cyanidin-3,5-diglucoside, pelargonidin-3,5-O-diglucoside
  and cyanidin-3-glucoside, respectively. f. The transient expression of RcMYB114b
  in apple fruit. The black triangle represents the site of the injection. g. Expression
  of anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway genes in RcMYB114b transgenic lines of apple.
  The bars indicate the SD. Stars mean significant differences (*** represents P < 0.001,
  ** represents P < 0.01, * represents P < 0.05) analyzed by one–way ANOVA
