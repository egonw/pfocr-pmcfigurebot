caption: Downregulation of FGFR1 attenuated the phosphorylation of FGFR1 and reversed
  the activity of Akt, ERK, and STAT3 signal induced by DJ-1. Cells with stable knockdown
  of FGFR1 were treated with or without DJ-1 (15 μg/mL) for 24 h, and then, the protein
  expression of p-FGFR1/FGFR1 (a), p-Akt/Akt (b), p-mTOR/mTOR (c), p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2
  (d), and p-STAT3/STAT3 (e) was examined by western blotting, respectively. The empty
  vector group was used as the control (Con). ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 versus Con.
