caption: GSDME (gasdermin E) induces mitochondrial damage in endothelial cells and
  activates the STING (stimulator of the interferon genes) pathway. (A–F) From 5 weeks
  of age, mice were placed on a WD (Western diet) regimen. Aortic samples were harvested
  from ApoE−/− (apolipoprotein E-deficient) and Gsdme−/−/ApoE−/− (Gsdme- and apolipoprotein
  E-deficient) mice at 18 weeks of age, as well as from 5-week-old ApoE−/− mice (not
  subjected to the WD). (A) Immunofluorescence staining of platelet endothelial cell
  adhesion molecule (CD31; green), double-stranded DNA (dsDNA; red), and 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
  (DAPI, blue), scale bars indicate 500 μm; (B) representative image of Western blot
  analysis of p-STING (phosphorylated STING), STING, p-TBK1 (phosphorylated TANK-binding
  kinase 1), TBK1, p-IRF3 (phosphorylated interferon regulatory factor-3), IRF3, p-NF-κB
  p65 (phosphorylated nuclear factor kappa-B p65), NF-κB p65, and β-actin; (C–F) the
  relative quantification of p-STING to STING, p-TBK1 to TBK1, p-IRF3 to IRF3, and
  p-NF-κB to NF-κB, n = 6; (G–K) HUVECs underwent transfection with either si-NC (scramble
  interfering RNA) or si-GSDME (GSDME siRNA) for a duration of 48 h. Subsequently,
  these cells were either treated with 100 μg/mL of ox-LDL (oxidized low-density lipoprotein)
  or exposed to PBS (phosphate buffer saline) for an additional 24 h. (G) Representative
  image of Western blot analysis of p-STING, STING, p-TBK1, TBK1, p-IRF3, IRF3, p-NF-κB
  p65, NF-κB p65, and β-actin. (H–K) Relative quantification of p-STING to STING,
  p-TBK1 to TBK1, p-IRF3 to IRF3, and p-NF-κB p65 to NF-κB p65, respectively, n =
  6.
