caption: Colony formation assay was used to detect cell proliferation. Compared with
  PANC-1 group, the proliferation of KRASWT group was decreased (P<0.01) and the changes
  in the proliferation of KRASG12D group were not statistically significant. (A) Representative
  images from one of the experiments. (B) Statistical data from three experiments
  presented as the mean ± standard deviation (**P<0.01). KRAS, Kirsten rat sarcoma
  virus; WT, wild-type.
article_title: Wild-type KRAS inhibits the migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer
  through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
