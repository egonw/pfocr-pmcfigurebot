caption: Both LINC01554 and miR-1267 overexpression modulated the ING3/Akt/mTOR pathway.
  (a, b) LINC01554 was associated with Akt/mTOR signalling. (c) The expression of
  ING3 and Akt/mTOR pathway-related proteins (Akt, p-Akt, mTOR, and p-mTOR) was detected
  via western blotting and quantitated in H23 and H1299 cells treated with pcDNA3.1-LINC01554
  and the empty pcDNA3.1 vector. (d) The expression of ING3 and Akt/mTOR pathway-related
  proteins (Akt, p-Akt, mTOR, and p-mTOR) was detected via western blotting and quantitated
  in H23 and H1299 cells treated with pcDNA3.1-LINC01554 and the empty pcDNA3.1 vector,
  miR-1267 mimic, and NC mimic.
