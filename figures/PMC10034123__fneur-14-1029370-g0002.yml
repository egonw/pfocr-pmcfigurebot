caption: (A) The results of gene ontology (GO) enrichment categories of the DEGs for
  both Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) groups
  including biological process (BP), cellular component (CC), and molecular function
  (MF). (B) The results of the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway
  enrichment analyses of the DEGs for both PDD and DLB, the abscissa represents GeneRatio
  (the number of genes enriched in this KEGG entry/the total number of genes), and
  the ordinate represents KEGG terms. P-adjust refers to the P-value after correction,
  the darker the red color, the greater the correlation. Counts refer to the number
  of genes enriched in this KEGG entry, the larger the circle, the more the number
  of genes.
