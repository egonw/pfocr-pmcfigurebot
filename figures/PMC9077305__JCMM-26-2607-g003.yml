caption: 'Periplocymarin (PM) engaged STAT3 in inhibiting AngⅡ‐induced cardiomyocyte
  remodelling. (A) H9c2 cells were transfected STAT3 overexpression plasmids and control
  cells were transfected with empty vector. Western blot was used to assess STAT3
  expression. (B) H9c2 cells transfected STAT3 over‐expression plasmids and negative
  control were treated with PM for 3 h and then submitted to 1 μM AngⅡ for 12 h or
  24 h. The expression of p‐STAT3 (Tyr705) was measured by Western blot. (C) Immunoblot
  analysis of Collagen I, TGF‐β1 and ANP following STAT3 over‐expression. (D) Representative
  phalloidin staining for cell surface area. Bars: 50 μm. (E) Western blot analysis
  of H9c2 cells which were submitted to different sequence of shRNA against STAT3.
  (F) H9c2 cells transfected STAT3 shRNA‐2 plasmids and empty plasmid were treated
  with PM for 3 h and then submitted to 1 μM AngⅡ for 12 h or 24 h. Western blot analysis
  for p‐STAT3 (Tyr705) level. (G) Effects of STAT3 shRNA on Collagen I, TGF‐β1 and
  ANP protein levels. (H) Phalloidin staining of STAT3 knockdown H9c2 cells. #p < 0.05,
  ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001 vs. NC group; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, $p < 0.05, $$p < 0.01
  vs. NC + AngⅡ group; &p < 0.05, &&p < 0.01 vs. NC + AngⅡ + PM group. Data were presented
  as the mean ± SD, n = 3'
