caption: The roles of caspase-8K14R in TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. (A) Effects of the
  K14R alteration on caspase-8 activity in A549 and SPCA1 cell lines. (B) IC50 assays
  were preformed, and the IC50 values of the cell lines treated with TRAIL were determined
  with CCK8 assays in SPCA1 cells. (C) Flow cytometry was performed to detect the
  apoptosis rates of A549 and SPCA1 cells treated with different concentrations of
  TRAIL. (D) The expression of caspase-8 (55 kDa) and cleaved caspase-8 (18 kDa) was
  detected by Western blot after transfection with plasmids containing the rs3769823[A]
  or rs3769823[G] allele into A549 and SPCA1 cells treated with different concentrations
  of TRAIL (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01).

  leading to a decreased risk of non-small cell lung cancer.
