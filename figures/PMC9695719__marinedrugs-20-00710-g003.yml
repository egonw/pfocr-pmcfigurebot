caption: SC reduces the intracellular ROS production and inactivates the MAPKs in
  glutamate-treated HT22 cells. The cells were incubated with or without indicated
  concentration of SC for 1 h, and then further incubated with 5 mM glutamate for
  12 h. (A) Effect of SC on intracellular ROS production. (B–E) Effect of SC on protein
  expression of MAPKs. The statistical symbols (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001;
  n.s., no significance) indicate significant differences from the glutamate-treated
  group.
