figure_title: Subtypes of Esophageal Function in scleroderma (SSc) defined by combined
  manometry/FLIP-panometry
caption: 'Patients are defined by peristaltic function on manometry (top panels) and
  contractile response to volumetric distention (bottom panels). Each pair of Manometric
  and FLIP Panometry images can be combined to create specific subtypes/stages: A)
  SSc with normal esophageal function. B) SSc – weak (moderate): ineffective esophageal
  motility (IEM) on manometry and borderline (diminished) function on FLIP Panometry.
  C) SSc- absent contractility with normal contractile response. D) SSC – absent contractility
  with impaired contractile response. E) End-stage SSc (absent-severe): absent contractility
  on manometry and an absent contractile response to volumetric distention. This model
  has the capacity to define disease progression along the neurogenic and myogenic
  pathway in extreme detail to provide a timeline for our translation assessment of
  molecular targets and biomarkers. Additionally, this assessment may uncover distinct
  phenotypes beyond the classic progression to aperistalsis and that may have varying
  levels of neurogenic dysfunction (e.g. Absent-mild). Figure used with permission
  from the Esophageal Center of Northwestern.'
