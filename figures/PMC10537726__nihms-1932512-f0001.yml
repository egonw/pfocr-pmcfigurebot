figure_title: FGFR signaling pathway in breast cancer
caption: 'The binding of FGFs to the extracellular domain of FGFR induces dimerization
  of the receptor and phosphorylation of its intracellular C-terminal domain. The
  C-terminal phosphorylated tyrosine residues serve as anchors for adaptor proteins
  that, in turn, activate four distinct signaling cascades: RAS-RAF-MEK-MAPK, PI3K-AKT,
  JAK-STAT and PLCγ. The activation of these pathways ultimately promotes the expression
  of transcriptional profiles associated with cell proliferation, differentiation,
  migration, drug resistance and ERα signaling. TME: tumor microenvironment; HSPG:
  heparan sulfate proteoglycan; FGFs fibroblast growth factors; FGFR: fibroblast growth
  factor receptor; PLCγ: phospholipase Cγ; PIP2: phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate;
  DAG: diacylglicerol; IP3: inositol triphosphate; PKC: protein kinase C; FRS2α: FGFR
  substrate 2α; GRB2: growth factor receptor-bound 2; GAB1: GRB2-associated binding
  protein 1; SOS: son of sevenless; PI3K: phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase;
  JAK: janus activated kinase; STAT: signal transducer and activator of transcription;
  ERα: estrogen receptor α.'
