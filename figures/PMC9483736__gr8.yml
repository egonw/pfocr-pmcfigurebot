caption: Integrated transcriptomics pathway diagrams from Jersey steer peripheral
  blood mononuclear cells in different temperature humidity index conditions. The
  hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) signaling pathway, NF-κB signaling pathway, phospholipase
  D signaling pathway, calcium signaling pathway and cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction
  of Jersey steers are presented with identified pathway associated genes. Red color
  indicates an association with an increase in high temperature period (HTP). Blue
  color indicates an association with a decrease in HTP. Gray color or uncolored indicate
  no statistical significance (n = 8).
