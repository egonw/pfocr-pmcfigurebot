caption: FRG1 depletion in breast cancer cells activates ERK and AKT in HUVECs. Conditioned
  media (CM) was collected from MCF7 and MDA‐MB‐231 cells with perturbed FRG1 expression,
  and HUVECs were incubated into it for 24 h. (A) Representative Western blot images
  showing activation of phospho‐ERK, phospho‐AKT 473/308 in HUVECs grown in the CM
  obtained from MCF7 cells with reduced expression of FRG1 (FRG1_KD) and control (Control_Sc).
  Bar diagrams depict the phospho‐ERK and phospho‐AKT 473/308 levels in the two groups.
  (B) Representative Western blot images showing phospho‐ERK, phospho‐AKT 473/308
  in HUVECs grown in the CM obtained from MDA‐MB‐231 cells with ectopic expression
  of FRG1 (FRG1_Ex), compared to control (Control_Ev). Bar diagrams depict the phospho‐ERK
  and phospho‐AKT 473/308 levels in the two groups. GAPDH was used as the loading
  control. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Two‐tailed unpaired Student's
  t‐test was used to compare the two groups' significance of differences. Results
  are presented as mean ± SD. nsP > 0.05, *P ≤ 0.05; **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001.
