caption: GS-Rg1 inhibited lung cancer growth via miR126 and mTOR. (a) miR126 inhibitor
  stopped increased the expression level of caspase 3 induced by GS-Rg1 in A549 cell
  line (∗P < 0.05); (b) miR126 inhibitor stopped increased the expression level of
  caspase 3 induced by GS-Rg1 in H1650 cell line (∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01); (c) si-mTOR
  stopped increased the expression level of caspase 3 induced by GS-Rg1 in A549 cell
  line (∗∗P < 0.01); (d) si-mTOR stopped increased the expression level of caspase
  3 induced by GS-Rg1 in H1650 cell line (∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01).
