caption: Active and tonic signals delivered by BcRs to CLL cells. Active signals (top).
  The BcR at the surface of CLL cells is cross-linked together with its accessory
  molecules (CD79a and CD79b, indicated in pale blue) by a self-antigen or an antigen
  of microorganisms, causing the activation of the downstream signaling pathway, the
  major steps of which are schematically depicted. Tonic signals (bottom). Spontaneous
  micro-aggregation of the BcR and its accessory molecules leads to Syk activation,
  which in turn activates downstream signaling. This further step is represented in
  gray, given that the steps involved have not yet received experimental confirmation.
