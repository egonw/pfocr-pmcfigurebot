caption: Metabolic phenotype of serum in mice. (A) Principal component analysis (PCA)
  showed differences in metabolites of serum samples in mice between the control,
  the HFD group, and the CO group. The green area represents the cumulative from the
  control mice, the pink circle exhibits the cumulative metabolites belonging to the
  HFD group, and the purple area shows the cumulative metabolites in CO treatment
  mice; (B) Metabolic pathway enrichment analysis. Overview of metabolites that were
  enriched in mice among three groups; (C) Metabolic pathway related to lipid enrichment
  analysis. Overview of metabolites related to lipid that was enriched in mice among
  three groups. Each dietary group comprised n = 6 mice.
