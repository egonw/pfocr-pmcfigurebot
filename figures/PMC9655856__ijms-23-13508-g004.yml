caption: IQGAP2 influenced migration and invasion of bladder cancer cells. (A) Migration
  and invasion were significantly increased after knockdown of IQGAP2 in TCCSUP. (B)
  Migration and invasion were significantly increased after knockdown of IQGAP2 in
  T24. (C) Migration and invasion were significantly decreased after overexpression
  of IQGAP2 in T24. Bar chart presents the means of replicates ± SEM from three different
  experiments; Student’s t-test (two-tailed, unpaired) was used for comparison of
  means.
