figure_title: Expression levels of genes involved in mitochondrial respiration and
  formation of cristae in the parasite Amoebophrya across different intracellular
  stages within its host (the dinoflagellate Scrippsiella acuminata) and in dinospores
  (extracellular)
caption: Heatmap showing the expression level of genes of the TCA cycle (A) and the
  OXPHOS (D) pathway of the parasite. See also Fig.  and Table ; (B) Expression levels
  of genes encoding MiC60 from the MICOS complex (MItochondrial contact site and Cristae
  Organizing System), and the prohibitin Phb1 and Phb2 genes. C Transmission Electron
  microscopy (TEM) micrographs showing the internal morphology of the mitochondrion
  of the parasite at different infection stages. In the cytoplasmic parasite, the
  electron dense mitochondrion harbored cristae (internal invagination of the inner
  mitochondrial membrane), which were absent in the mitochondrion of the nuclear trophont
  parasites (young and mature trophonts). Some vesicles could be observed in the mitochondrion
  of the mature trophont. Cristae reappeared in the sporont stage where the mitochondrion
  was substantially developed. The list of genes, their sequences and expression values
  can be found in Table .
