caption: Pathway enrichment analysis of annotated features related to OSA severity
  in AD patients. Scatter plot presenting the enriched lipid pathways in which classes
  representative of all identified lipids are involved. Each circle represents a pathway.
  The colour gradient indicates the significance of the pathway ranked by p value,
  with yellow indicating lower values and red indicating higher values (y-axis). The
  size of the circles represents the impact score of the pathway based on the number
  of molecules contained in the pathway (x-axis). Significantly affected pathways
  appear with their name. *Significant after FDR correction (p <0.05)
