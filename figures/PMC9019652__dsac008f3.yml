caption: 'Genes involved in gentiopicroside biosynthesis. (A) A simplified representation
  of the gentiopicroside biosynthetic pathway. Top hits for pathway genes identified
  by blast and the expression value for each gene is indicated in color on a log10
  (TPM + 1) (transcripts per million) scale for eight tissues: root, rhizome, corolla,
  flower, stem, old stem, leaf, and old leaf. (B) A phylogenetic tree of all candidate
  genes in the CYP72A subfamily. The sequences shown in figure indicate previously
  published 7-DLH and SLS genes, and candidate genes identified in the G. dahurica
  genome. (C) Phylogenetic tree of the candidate CYP450 enzyme encoding genes identified
  in the G. dahurica genome. Different colors indicate different CYP450 family members
  classified based on the protein domain annotation, homolog searching by A. thaliana
  and SwissProt protein database. Families involved in gentiopicroside biosynthesis
  were marked by arcs.'
