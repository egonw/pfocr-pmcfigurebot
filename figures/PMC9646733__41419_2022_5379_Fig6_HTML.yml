figure_title: RHBDL2 stabilizes the N1ICD via the OTUD7B
caption: A The deubiquitinase screening procedure for N1ICD. B Western blot analysis
  was performed to measure the expression levels of N1ICD, OTUD7B, ATXN3, and USP10
  in the indicated PC cells. Immunoprecipitation assay of OTUD7B and N1ICD (C–D),
  OTUD7B and RHBDL2 (E–F). G The expression levels of HA-OTUD7B and Flag-RHBDL2 were
  confirmed by immunoprecipitation. H The levels of N1ICD and Flag-OTUD7B were determined
  by Western blot assay. I The PC cells were treated with 15 μM of MG132 for 6 h prior
  to harvest. The cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with Myc-tag antibody and immunoblotted
  as indicated. J The levels of N1ICD, Flag-RHBDL2, and OTUD7B in the indicated PC
  cells were detected by Western blot assay. K The PC cells were treated with 15 μM
  of MG132 for 6 h prior to harvest. The cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with Myc-tag
  antibody and immunoblotted as indicated. L The expression levels of N1ICD, RHBDL2,
  and OTUD7B in the indicated PC cells were determined by Western blot assay.

  cancer by stabilizing the N1ICD via the OTUD7B and activating the Notch signaling
