caption: 'PG induced GBM cell cycle arrest by inhibiting the KIAA1524/PP2A signaling
  pathway (a) The activity of PP2A in GBM cells was increased after exposure to PG:
  GBM cells were treated with PG, OA or both at 100 nM for 24 h, and cell lysates
  were extracted to assess the activity of PP2A. (b) RT-PCR analysis of KIAA1524 expression
  in LN229, U251 and A172 cells treated with or without PG. (c) Western blotting analysis
  of KIAA1524 expression in LN229 and U251 cells treated with or without PG. (d) Western
  blotting analysis of the target proteins after ectopic expression of KIAA1524 in
  LN229 cells. Experiments were performed three times. (e) Graphic representation
  of relative levels of protein expression in LN229 cells treated with PG with or
  without KIAA1524. Data are expressed as the means ± SD. p < 0.05.'
