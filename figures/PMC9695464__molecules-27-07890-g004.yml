caption: Differential metabolites found by metabolomics analysis and metabolic pathway
  analysis in NCTC clone 1469 cells (n = 6) and liver tissue (n = 8) after hepatectomy
  treated with ASP-AMP. Clustering heat map of total differential metabolites in hepatocytes
  (a) and liver tissue (b). Red refers to upregulated and blue refers to downregulated
  metabolites. KEGG pathway enrichment bubble diagram in hepatocytes (c) and liver
  tissue (d). The top 20 in terms of metabolite numbers are displayed, including glycolysis/gluconeogenesis,
  the citrate cycle (TCA cycle), and the pentose phosphate pathway. Six predictive
  metabolites related to glycometabolism are shown for hepatocytes (e) and liver tissue
  (f). Relative abundances were log10-transformed. Data were generated by LC-UHPLC.
  Lactate measurement in the hepatocyte supernatant (g) and mouse serum (h). Ctrl
  refers to the control group, and test refers to the experimental group treated with
  ASP-AMP for 3 days. ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001.
