caption: 'The silencing of SAAL1 alleviated LPS-induced inflammation and suppressed
  the NLR signaling pathway. The production of TNF-α (A), IL-6 (B), and IL-1β (C)
  in the A549 cells was measured by ELISAs. (D) The protein levels of NLRP3, NOD1,
  and MAPK1 in the A549 cells was checked by western blotting. **, P<0.01 vs. control
  group; ##, P<0.01 vs. si-NC + LPS group. SAAL1, serum amyloid A-like 1; LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor alpha; IL-1β, interleukin-1 beta; ELISAs, enzyme-linked
  immunosorbent assays; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; si-NC, small
  interfering RNA negative control.'
