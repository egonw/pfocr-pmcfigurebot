caption: Molecular mechanisms of pyroptosis triggered by excess Cu. Excessive Cu influx
  through CTR1 leads to mitochondrial stress and activation of the caspase-3/GSDMD-dependent
  pyroptosis signaling pathway. GSDMD, downstream of caspase-3, forms an N-terminal
  domain that perforates the cell membrane, causing cell swelling, rupture, and release
  of inflammatory factors and DAMPs. Moreover, GSDMD is the effector protein of caspase-8/ASC/11,
  which undergoes cysteine cleavage to generate the N-terminal domain and promote
  pyroptosis. The GSDMD-dependent cell death pathway is mainly triggered by various
  aberrant signals, including the release of inflammatory factors that initiate a
  cascade of intracellular inflammatory responses (e.g., NF-ÎºB).
