caption: KEGG enrichment analysis for five key targets implicated in the role of Celastrol
  in DCM. Top 30 signaling pathway with P < 0.05 were identified using R packages.
  (a) Histograms, (b) bubble diagram, and (c) chordal graph showing top 30 enriched
  signaling pathways. The x-axis represents enriched gene count or ratio, and y-axis
  represents the different biological processes. Color intensity represents adjusted
  P value.
