figure_title: Effect of TLB on activation of microglia and astrocytes through HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB
  signaling pathway in hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice
caption: 'The expressions of the microglia marker (Iba-1) or astrocyte marker (GFAP)
  in CA1, CA3 and DG hippocampal regions were observed using IHC. a Representative
  images of Iba-1 expression in hippocampus. b Iba-1-positive cell numbers in the
  CA1 region (n = 5). c Iba-1-positive cell numbers in the CA3 region (n = 5). d Iba-1-positive
  cell numbers in the DG region (n = 5). e Representative images of GFAP expression
  in hippocampus. f GFAP-positive cell numbers in the CA1 region (n = 5). g GFAP-positive
  cell numbers in the CA3 region (n = 5). h GFAP-positive cell numbers in the DG region
  (n = 5). i IL-1β level (n = 6). j IL-6 level (n = 6). k TNF-α level (n = 6). l HMGB1
  level (n = 6). m Representative Western blot of cytoplasm-HMGB1 protein expression.
  n Quantitation of cytoplasm-HMGB1 protein expression (n = 5). o Representative Western
  blot of nucleus-HMGB1 protein. p Quantitation of nucleus-HMGB1 protein expression
  (n = 5). q Representative Western blot of TLR4 protein expression. r Quantitation
  of TLR4 protein expression (n = 5). s Representative Western blot of MyD88 protein
  expression. t Quantitation of MyD88 protein expression (n = 5). u Representative
  Western blot of TRAF6 protein expression. v Quantitation of TRAF6 protein expression
  (n = 5). w Representative Western blot of phosphorylation of NF-κBp65 protein level.
  x Quantitation of phosphorylation of NF-κBp65 protein level (n = 5). y NF-κBp65
  binding activity determined at OD 450 nm (n = 6). The data were presented as the
  mean ± SEM. **P < 0.01 vs. WT group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 vs. APP/PS1 group. (magnification
  ×40 and ×400, scale bar = 500 μm and 50 μm).'
