figure_title: Effects of TVB3664 and cabozantinib combinational treatment on the sgPTEN/c-MET
  mouse HCCs
caption: (A) Genetic dissimilarity among the samples in each group as demonstrated
  by multidimensional scaling (MDS). (B) Numbers of overlapped down-regulated genes
  in the Cabozantinib (CAB), TVB3664 (TVB), and Cabozantinib and TVB3664 (COM) treated
  samples as compared to the vehicle-treated samples. (C-E) KEGG analysis of down-regulated
  genes in the TVB3664 (C), Cabozantinib (D), and Cabozantinib and TVB3664 (E) combinational
  treated samples as compared to the vehicle-treated samples. (F) Analysis of the
  PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, major targets of cabozantinib, and cell cycle-related
  proteins. GAPDH was used as the loading control.
