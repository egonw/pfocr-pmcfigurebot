caption: WNT/β-catenin pathway dependent regulation of ALDH1A3. (A) Bru-seq coverage
  for EYA4 in isogenic SU-DIPG XIII cells. (B) qRT-PCR of EYA4 in isogenic SU-DIPG
  XIII. Data were normalized to GAPDH. Values were represented as mean ± SEM from
  three independent experiments. Statistically, significance was determined using
  unpaired t-test (P = 0.000034). (C) Representative western blot analysis of EYA4
  expression in isogenic SU-DIPG XIII (n = 3). (D) Bru-seq analysis of Wnt genes in
  DIPG XIII K27M and KO cells. Bru-seq was performed in replicates of two. (E) qRT-PCR
  of Wnt genes in isogenic SU-DIPG XIII. Data were normalized to GAPDH and fold change
  was calculated and compared with DIPG XIII K27M KO cells. Values were represented
  as mean ± SEM from three independent experiments. Statistically, significance was
  determined using t-test and indicated (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.005, ***p < 0.0005). (F)
  Conditioned media was obtained from isogenic cells grown in TSM complete media for
  24 or 48 h. Media was then collected, and heat inactivated at 95 °C for 30 min or
  left untreated. Isogenic cells were then treated for 24 or 48 h with indicated media
  prior to RNA isolation followed by qRT-PCR for ALDH1A3. Data was normalized to GAPDH
  and represented as fold change ± SEM from three independent experiments. Statistical
  significance was determined using t-test and indicated (***p < 0.0005). (G) qRT-PCR
  of ALDH1A3 in isogenic SU-DIPG XIII cells treated with 10 µM pan-Wnt inhibitor XAV-939
  for 24 hrs. Statistically, significance was determined using unpaired t-test and
  indicated (***p < 0.0005, n.s. = no statistical significance). (H) Representative
  western blot analysis of β-catenin expression in isogenic SU-DIPG XIII (n = 3).
