caption: Regulation of angiogenesis via the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in CRC. In
  the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, SLC6A14 and FLANC promote angiogenesis. SLC6A14
  activates JAK2 through phosphorylation, after which STAT3 is activated by mutual
  phosphorylation, and STAT3 then enters the nucleus and activates the transcription
  of Bcl-2. FLANC enters the nucleus directly and activates the transcription of VEGFA.
  Factors inhibiting CRC angiogenesis via JAK2/STAT3 signaling include ISM1, NSC13626,
  Gracillin, and miR-216. ISM1 activates the transcription of Bcl-2 via the IL2/STAT5
  signaling pathway and activates PL-1 via the IL6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. NSC13626
  has a negative feedback mechanism with JAK2, and the downstream target of JAK2 is
  p-STAT3. Gracillin inhibits the transcription of Bcl-2 and VEGFA via the IL6/JAK2/STAT3
  signaling pathway. MiR-216 inhibits angiogenesis by targeting HMGB1, which mediates
  the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Aflibercept, convallatoxin, and ponatinib are antiangiogenic
  drugs in CRC. Aflibercept modulates inflammation-related angiogenesis via the IL-6/JAK2/STAT3
  axis, ultimately regulating the transcription of VEGFA. CNT also shows efficacy
  in the inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 to inhibit the expression of Bcl-2 and VEGFA. Ponatinib
  inhibits JAK2/STAT3 activity driven by EGF/EGFR, IL-6/IL-6R, and IL-11/IL-11R, regulating
  the transcription of SOCS3.
