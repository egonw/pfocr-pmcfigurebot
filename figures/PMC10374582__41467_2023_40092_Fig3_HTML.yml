figure_title: Kinetic characterization of recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme
caption: a, b Kinetic analysis of SlGAME36 with hydroxytomatine (a) and hydroxysolamargine
  (b) as acceptor substrates. c, d Kinetic analysis of acetyl CoA (c) and butyryl
  CoA (d) as acyl donor substrates for SlGAME36. Values represent means ± standard deviation
  obtained from three independent assays (n = 3). Kinetic parameters were calculated
  using non-linear regression model in the GraphPad Prism 8.0 software. Source data
  are provided as a Source Data file.
