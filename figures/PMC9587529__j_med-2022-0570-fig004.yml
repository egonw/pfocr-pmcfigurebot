caption: 'Silencing of CPSF7 inhibits the malignant characteristics of LUAD cells
  by blocking the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. (a) Protein expression of p-AKT/AKT
  and p-mTOR/mTOR was detected by Western blotting. (b) Cell viability was measured
  by CCK-8 assay. (c) Colony number was detected by colony formation assay. (d) Cell
  migration rate was detected by wound healing assay (scale bar = 50 µm). (e) Invasion
  rate was detected by Transwell assay (scale bar = 50 µm). A549 cells were transfected
  with si-CPSF7 and treated with SC79 (an activator of the AKT/mTOR pathway). Each
  experiment was repeated three times (n = 3). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 vs Control; #P
  < 0.05; ##P < 0.01 vs si-CPSF7.'
