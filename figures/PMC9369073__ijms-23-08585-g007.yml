caption: KEGG pathway enrichment analyses of the two tea plant genotypes in response
  to heterogeneous vs. homogeneous K environments. KEGG pathway enrichment analyses
  in genotype “1511” to acclimate to heterogeneous K supply (A). KEGG pathway enrichment
  analyses in genotype “1601” to acclimate to heterogeneous K supply. The key genes
  for KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were circled in the Venn diagrams (B).
