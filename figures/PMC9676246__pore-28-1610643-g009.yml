caption: Analysis of glycolysis-related lncRNA target genes. (A) SBSPON is the most
  likely target gene of AC005165.1 by MEM. (B) SBSPON is lowly expressed in gastric
  cancer tissues (***p < 0.001). (C) GSEA suggests that SBSPON is involved in aminoacyl-tRNA
  biosynthesis, citrate cycle, fructose and mannose metabolism, pentose phosphate
  pathway and pyrimidine metabolism.
