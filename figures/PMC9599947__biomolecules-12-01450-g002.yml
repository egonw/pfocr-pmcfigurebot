caption: 'IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway. IL-6 binds to the IL-6 receptor α (IL-6Rα),
  thereby inducing the formation of a complex consisting of two molecules each of
  IL-6, IL-6R, and GP130. Formation of this complex leads to activation of the JAK/STAT3
  signaling pathway, resulting in the transcription of STAT3 target genes. Some growth
  factors can also activate the JAK/STAT3 pathway. Soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R) can be generated
  by alternative splicing of IL6R mRNA. sIL-6R binds to IL-6 to form a complex that
  binds and induces dimerization of GP130, leading to activation of downstream signaling
  pathways. Once bound to gp130, STAT3 is phosphorylated by JAK at tyrosine 705, leading
  to STAT3 dimerization and nuclear translocation, followed by STAT3-mediated transcription
  of target genes. Some molecules, such as miR-181d, miR-124, miR-451a, miR-551-3p,
  and tyrosine phosphatase can inhibit the STAT3 pathway. MiR-211, miR-222, miR-147,
  and miR-30 can promote STAT3 gene expression. When STAT3 is activated, it can promote
  the function of downstream molecules. Abbreviations: miR, microRNA; EGFR, epidermal
  growth factor receptor; CTGFR, connective tissue growth factor receptor; PDGFR,
  platelet-derived growth factor receptor.'
