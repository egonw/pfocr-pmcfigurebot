figure_title: Leonurine reduced myocardial injury in rats with ISO-induced heart failure
caption: 'Myocardial injury is responsive to LDH and CK. Leonurine decreased levels
  of (A) CK and (B) LDH in plasma in heart failure rats induced by ISO. #P<0.05, ##P<0.01,
  model group vs. control group; *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, leonurine groups vs.
  model group. CK, creatine kinase; LDH, lactic dehydrogenase.'
article_title: Leonurine inhibits cardiomyocyte pyroptosis to attenuate cardiac fibrosis
  via the TGF-Î²/Smad2 signalling pathway.
