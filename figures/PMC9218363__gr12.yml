caption: Caspase 3 inhibitor ZDEVD reverses the cytotoxic effect of NSC49L and TRAIL
  in FOLFOX-HT29 cellsCells were pretreated with 20 μM ZDEVD for 3 h followed by the
  treatment with different concentrations of NSC49L and TRAIL either alone or in combination
  for an additional 72 h. Cell viability was determined using the MTT-assay.(A) The
  IC50 of TRAIL.(B) The IC50 of NSC49L in a combination of TRAIL. Data are the mean ±
  SE of four estimations. The p-value is shown on the top of each graph.(C) Western
  bots. For these experiments, after pretreatment with ZDEVD, the treatment with NSC49L
  and TRAIL either alone or in combination was carried out for 24 h. Blots are the
  representative of two different experiments. See also .
