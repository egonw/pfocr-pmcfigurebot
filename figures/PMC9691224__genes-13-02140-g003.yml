caption: Pathway Analysis and PPI Network Establishment based on DE-mRNAs. (A) GO
  analysis revealed DE-mRNAs enriched in DNA damage- and repair-related GO terms.
  (B) The DE-mRNAs were significantly enriched in some DNA damage- and repair-related
  pathways in Reactome. (C) PPI network established based on DE-mRNAs. The node size
  was mapped according to |log2FoldChange| values, and the lines between the nodes
  were mapped by interaction scores. Pink represents the upregulated mRNA in the LSKL
  group compared to the UV control, and blue represents downregulated mRNAs. (D) The
  top 10 hub genes ranked according to the calculation of node connectivity by cytoHubba.
