caption: SIK3 prevents TNF-induced apoptosis via NF-κB activation. (A–C) siRNA-transfected
  PANC-1-luc cells were treated with 100 ng/mL of rHuTNF. At the indicated time points,
  tumor cells were harvested and total protein fraction was isolated. Luminex assay
  was performed for active caspase 8 (A), active caspase 9 (B), and pJNK (C). Graphs
  show MFI of analyte-specific beads after normalization to Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (GAPDH). (D) PANC-1 cells were transiently transfected either with
  SIK3 overexpressing vector (Over) or with control vector (EV) for 48 hours. Afterwards,
  ELISA was performed for detection of nuclear p65 subunit of NF-κB. (E) PANC-1 cells
  were transfected with indicated siRNAs for 72 hours and treated with 100 ng/mL rHuTNF
  or culture medium for the indicated time points. p65 NF-κB ELISA was conducted as
  in (D). (F) Effect of pharmacological SIK3 inhibition on NF-κB activity. PANC-1
  cells expressed luciferase under the control of an NF-κB promoter. Reporter PANC-1
  were treated with different concentrations of HG-9-91-01 before the addition of
  10 ng/mL rHuTNF for 8 hours. Cells were lysed and luciferase activity was measured.
  Data are shown as percent of NF-κB activity normalized to PANC-1 cells treated with
  10 ng/mL rHuTNF without inhibitor. (G) Principal component analysis based on all
  identified chromatin accessible sites over all samples comprising siRNA transfected
  PANC-1-luc cells that were either untreated or treated with 100 ng/mL of rHuTNF
  for 4 hour or 24 hours. (H) Numbers of significant differentially accessible regions
  between comparison of SIK3 knockout and WT PANC-1 cells treated with rHuTNF for
  4 or 24 hours (Benjamini-Hochberg corrected padj <0.05, log2 fold change >1, normalized
  mean accessibility ≥10). (I) M (log ratio) and A (average) (MA)-plot showing the
  log2 fold change and mean accessibility in the comparisons from (H). Significant
  differentially accessible regions are colored in dark violet. (J) Representative
  IGV genome browser snapshots of the TRAF1 locus for SIK3 knockdown and WT PANC-1
  cells treated with rHuTNF for 4 or 24 hours. (K) Motif analysis of individual comparisons
  from (H). color code of heatmap indicates significance (z-score of log10 p value)
  of de novo identified transcription factor motifs in differential peaks from the
  respective pairwise comparisons. (L) ATAC-seq signal at motif-centered peaks containing
  the de novo discovered motifs of BORIS, NF-κB, and IRF from (K). X-axis shows distance
  from motif center in bp, y-axis number of normalized reads. (M) Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment of genes in the vicinity of differential
  accessible chromatin regions from comparisons in (H). (A–C, E) Cumulative data of
  three independent experiments. (D, F) Representative data of at least two independent
  experiments. Columns show mean±SEM. P values were calculated using two-tailed Student
  t-test. *P<0.05, **P<0.01. ATAC-seq, assay for transposable-accessible chromatin
  with sequencing; bp, base pair; EV, empty vector; IRF, interferon regulatory factor;
  MFI, median fluorescent intensity; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa B; pJNK, c-Jun N-terminal
  protein kinase; rHuTNF, recombinant tumor necrosis factor; SIK3, salt-inducible
  kinase 3; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; WT, wild type.

  attack by promoting TNF-induced NF-κB activation.
