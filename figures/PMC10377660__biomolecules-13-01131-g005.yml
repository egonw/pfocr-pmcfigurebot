caption: The expression of death receptor pathway proteins in HepG2 cells treated
  with apigetrin. Apigetrin induces Fas, FasL, cleaved caspase 8, cleaved caspase
  3, and cleaved PARP protein expressions in HepG2 cells. The cells were treated with
  stated concentrations (0, 50, and 100 µM) of apigetrin for 48 h. Total cell lysate
  was resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels and transferred
  to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. Using an electrochemiluminescence
  (ECL) detection process, the proteins were detected. The data are presented as the
  mean ± standard error of mean (SEM). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
