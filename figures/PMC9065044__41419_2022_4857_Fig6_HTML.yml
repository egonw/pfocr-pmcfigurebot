figure_title: POU6F1 binds RORA and enhances the stabilization and activity of RORA
caption: 'A Real-time qRT-PCR assay indicating the expression of RORA in A549 cells
  stably transfected with empty vector (mock) or POU6F1. B Co-IP and western blotting
  assays indicating the endogenous interaction between POU6F1 and RORA in A549 cells.
  The immunoglobulin G (IgG)-bound protein was taken as the negative control. C Mass
  spectrometry detection showing the spectrogram of RORA in A549 and HEK293T cells
  pulled down by POU6F1 antibody. D Immunofluorescence assay confirming the colocalization
  of POU6F1 and RORA in A549 cells transfected with empty vector (pCMV-HA) or pCMV-HA-POU6F1.
  Scale bars:10 µm. E Confocal images of BiFC showing the direct visualization of
  POU6F1 and RORA in A549 cells co-transfected with pBiFC-VC155-POU6F1 and pBiFC-VN173-RORA.
  Scale bars:10 µm. F Western blotting assay showing the expression of RORA in A549
  and NCI-H1299 cells transfected with mock, POU6F1, CRISPRi-Scb, CRISPRi-POU6F1 #1,
  or CRISPRi-POU6F1 #1. G Co-IP and western blotting assays indicating the interaction
  between POU6F1 and RORA in A549 cells transfected with mock or POU6F1. H Western
  blotting assay showing the expression of POU6F1 and RORA in A549 cells transfected
  with mock, RORA, scramble shRNA (sh-Scb), sh-RORA #1, or sh-RORA #2. I Western blotting
  assay showing the expression of RORA in A549 cells transfected with CRISPRi-Scb
  or CRISPRi-POU6F1 #1, and those treated with MG132 (5 μmol/l) for 6 h. J Dual-luciferase
  assay indicating relative promoter activity of RORA in A549 and NCI-H1299 cells
  transfected with mock or POU6F1. Student t-test compared the difference in A and
  J. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.'
