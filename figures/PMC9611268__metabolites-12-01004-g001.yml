caption: 'Metabolomic analysis of IIM patients, AS patients, and healthy controls.
  (A) PCA plot of AS patients, IIM patients, and healthy controls. (B) Heatmap of
  significant metabolites with group average in IIM, including amino acid, biogenic
  amine and acylcarnitine class. (C) Heatmap of significant metabolites with group
  average in IIM, including SMs, lysoPCs, PC, and hexoses. For the full name of metabolites,
  please see . (D) MetaMapp metabolomic networks of human serum alterations in IIM
  patients compared to healthy controls. Border color and node color: red indicates
  up-regulation in IIM, and blue indicates down-regulation in IIM. Node size indicates
  the FDR-adjusted p-value.'
