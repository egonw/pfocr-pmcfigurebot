caption: Effects of PL on the expression of the MAPK pathway-related proteins in oral
  cancer cell lines. MC-3 and HSC-4 cells were treated with indicated concentrations
  of PL for 24 h and harvested to measure expression levels of MAPK pathways; ERK,
  JNK, and p38 proteins were detected by Western blot analysis. Î²-actin was used as
  loading control. The results are representative of three independent experiments
  (statistically significant differences, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 vs. the control
  group).
