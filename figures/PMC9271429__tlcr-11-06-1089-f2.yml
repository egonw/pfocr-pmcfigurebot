caption: 'STT3A knockout inhibits tumor cell growth. (A) Establishment of STT3A knockout
  cell lines in PC-9 and H1299 verified by Western blot. (B) STT3A knockout significantly
  inhibited PC-9 and H1299 cell proliferation. (C, D) STT3A knockout also significantly
  affected the colony formation ability of these cell lines but did not lead to apoptosis.
  (E) Effect of STT3A knockout on the G0/G1 cell-cycle transition was detected in
  the PC-9 and H1299 cells by PI staining and flow cytometry. (F) The quantification
  data was analyzed by ModFit 5. (G) STT3A regulated the expression of the cell-cycle
  transition mediators, including CDK4, CDK6, p21, and p27. Staining method for (C):
  0.1% crystal violet. The data are presented as mean ± standard deviation according
  to the Student’s t-test. **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.001. sgNC, small guide RNA negative
  control; sgSTT3A, small guide RNA of STT3A; STT3A, STT3 oligosaccharyltransferase
  complex catalytic subunit A; PI, propidium iodide.'
