caption: 'Dabrafenib differentially induces paradoxical activation of phosphodeficient
  BRAFS732Aand phosphomimetic BRAFS732E.A and B, representative immunoblot of three
  biological replicates expressing BRAFS732A-FLAG (A) and BRAFS732E-FLAG (B) in HEK293 cells
  with 1-h dabrafenib treatment (0–10 μM). Phosphorylated MEK1/2 (pMEK1/2) and phosphorylated
  ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) are included as RAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 phosphorylated activity readouts
  of the MAPK pathway in response to dabrafenib treatment (n = 3). The markers next
  to the immunoblots represent molecular weights in kDa. C and D densitometry analysis
  of three biological replicates for relative (C) pMEK1/2 and (D) pERK1/2 ratios.
  Relative ratios are normalized to the 0 μM (n = 3). The 0 μM accounts for the highest
  volume of DMSO. Phosphomimetic BRAFS732E requires a higher dose of dabrafenib to
  induce paradoxical activation. Graph bars represent the mean± SD with individual
  data points per biological replicate. Statistical significance was determined via
  two-way ANOVA, followed by the post hoc Holm–Bonferroni test for multiple comparisons.
  p-values are represented by: ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001.'
