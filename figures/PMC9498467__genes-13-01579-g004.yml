caption: Senescent fibroblastspromote the migration and invasionof lung cancer cells
  H1299 and A549through the Stat3 pathway. (A). Western blotting analysis of Stat3
  and Vimentin expression in senescent fibroblasts and Stat3-transfected senescent
  fibroblasts. Quantification of the Western blotting and statistical analysis. *,
  p < 0.05. (B). Transwell assays were performed to evaluate the migration and invasion
  of H1299 and A549, following a co-culture with fibroblasts. An average migration/invasion
  ±SEM from three independent experiments was performed. Statistical analysis. **,
  p < 0.01, ***, p < 0.001. (C). Quantification of CXCL12, FGF10, IL6 and COL1A1 mRNA
  from fibroblasts by qRT-PCR. Values (mean ± SEM) were derived from three independent
  experiments. *, p < 0.05 **, p < 0.01, ***, p < 0.001.
