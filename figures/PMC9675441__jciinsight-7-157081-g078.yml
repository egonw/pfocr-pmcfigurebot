caption: (A) CTR-KD and ISG-KD ARD cells that were treated with BTZ (5 nM, 1.5 hours,
  left) and CFZ (3.5 nM, 1.5 hours, right). The solvent DMSO served as a negative
  CTR. Proteasome activity was determined by measuring the fluorescence (amc) intensity
  released by the cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate suc-LLVY-amc (n = 6). Student’s
  t test was performed. ****P ≤ 0.0001. (B) Proteasome activity of CTR and ISG-OE
  AMO1 cells pretreated with BTZ (5 nM, 1.5 hours) or CFZ (3.5 nM, 1.5 hours) (n =
  6). Student’s t test was performed. ****P ≤ 0.0001. (C) CTR-KD versus ISG-KD ARD
  cells, as well as CTR versus ISG-OE AMO1 MM cells, were treated with BTZ (5 nM,
  4 hours). The cell lysates were used for Western blotting to examine UPR pathway
  activation. The UPR pathway components ATF6, PERK, p-PERK (T982), eIF2α, p-eIF2α
  (S51), ATF4, CHOP, and XBP-1s were analyzed. p38MAPK and p-p38MAPK (T180/Y182) were
  also examined. (D) Western blot results showed the signaling molecules in UPR and
  ER stress pathways in CTR-KD versus ISG-KD ARD cells, which were treated with BTZ
  (5 nM) for 1 hour or 6 hours.
