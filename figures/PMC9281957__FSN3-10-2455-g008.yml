caption: Effects of surfactin on mRNA and protein expression level of proinflammatory
  factors associated with insulin resistance signaling pathway in IR‐HepG2 cells.
  (a) The mRNA expression of IL‐1β. (b) The protein expression of IL‐1β. (c) The mRNA
  expression of IL‐6. (d) The mRNA expression of TNF‐α. All data are presented as
  mean ± SD (n = 6) for each group. Different lowercase alphabet letters over bars
  indicate statistically significant differences between two groups (p < .05)
