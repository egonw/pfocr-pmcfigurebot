caption: 'Hydroxytyrosol (HT) inhibits MG-induced pulmonary injury. (A) Graphic experimental
  outline of the experiment. (B) Histopathological changes in the chicken lungs are
  shown by HE staining. (C) Ultrastructural pathological changes in the chicken lungs
  are shown by TEM (red arrow: MG). (D) The effect of MG infection on the chicken
  lung was estimated using TUNEL staining. (E) The effect of MG infection on the rate
  of TUNEL-positive cells using immunofluorescence microscopy.'
