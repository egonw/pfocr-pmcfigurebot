caption: Mitochondria (Mt) remodeling to an aberrant Mt (aMt) phenotype with dysfunction
  and damage to organ systems. This figure is an illustration of proposed mitochondrial-mediated
  mechanisms of disease development and progression associated with aMt dysfunction
  and damage that have been implicated in numerous organ systems and clinical diseases
  (left-hand standing man image). Oxidativeâ€”redox stress includes the sum of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and reactive sulfur species
  (RSS) to create the reactive oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur species (RONSS) interactome.
  Importantly, aortic stiffening may be the nexus for a heart-brain-kidney axis (red
  circles) illustrating the aortic vascular pathway of vascular stiffening to affect
  the carotid and renal arteries and target organs of the heart-brain-kidney axis.
