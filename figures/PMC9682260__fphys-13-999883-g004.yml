caption: Contribution of rafts and submicrometric cholesterol-enriched domains in
  cancer. (A) Rafts recruit and cluster proteins involved in proliferation, survival,
  adhesion, migration and apoptosis. Binding of growth factors induce phosphorylation
  (P) and activation of tyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs) recruited in raft, which
  then activate downstream signaling cascades like the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
  (PI3K)/AKT and MAPK pathway promoting cell proliferation and survival. Domains also
  promote adhesion and migration of cancer cells by recruitment of integrins and displacement
  of the cell surface adhesion receptor CD44 to non-raft membrane areas. Fas/CD95
  death receptors cluster in rafts to recruit the adaptor molecule Fas-associated
  death domain (FADD) which activates the caspase-mediated pro-apoptotic signaling
  pathway. PIP2, phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol
  (3,4,5)-trisphosphate; ECM, extracellular matrix; ERM, Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin; FAK,
  focal adhesion kinase. (B) Chol-enriched domains participate in membrane deformation
  either by forming actin-based and proteolytically-active invadopodia or releasing
  microvesicles (MVs). MMPs, matrix metalloproteinases. (C) Rafts mediate recognition
  between cells. The antigen presented at the surface of the antigen presenting cell
  (APC) by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II is recognized by the
  T cell receptors (TCR) clustered in rafts and induce T cell activation. See the  of
  the text for further details.
