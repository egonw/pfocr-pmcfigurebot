caption: NFκB Acts Downstream of the cGAS-STING Pathway to Drive Cardiac Hypertrophic
  Program in a CKD Milieu(A) Gene set enrichment analysis of IκB kinase NFκB signaling
  in the myocardia. (B) Representative images of p65 and cTNT staining in the myocardia.
  The region marked by the box is magnified in the right panel. Cytoplasmic p65 is
  marked by white arrows, and nuclear p65 is marked by red arrows. Scale bar, 20 μm
  in the left panels and 4 μm in the right panels. (C) Representative western blot
  (WB) analysis of p-IkBα and p65 in the myocardia. (D) Representative WB analysis
  of p-IκBα and p65 in the myocardia from sham and CKD mice with or without VBIT-4
  treatment. (E) Representative WB analysis of p-IκBα and p65 in the myocardia from
  sham and CKD mice in each group. (F) Representative WB analysis of p-IκBα and p65
  in the myocardia from sham and CKD mice in each group. Data represent mean ± SD
  and were analyzed using 2-tailed Student’s t-test (C) or 1-way analysis of variance
  (D to F). n = 3 biologically independent experiments. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001. WT = wild-type; other abbreviations as in , , and .
