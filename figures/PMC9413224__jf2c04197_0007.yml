caption: '(A) MSEA showing the identified metabolic pathways based on the 24 differential
  amino acids: the horizontal bar graph summarizes metabolic pathways mainly affected
  by the growth of P. ostreatus samples on WS and LcS substrates; and (B) MetPA showing
  all matched pathways according to p-values from the pathway enrichment analysis
  (y-axis) and pathway impact values from the pathway topology analysis (x-axis).
  Small p-values and large pathway impact circles indicate that the pathway is greatly
  perturbed.'
