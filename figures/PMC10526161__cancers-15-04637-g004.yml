caption: 'Metabolic heterogeneity of breast cancer patients in different age groups.
  (A) Heatmap displaying the normalized enrichment score (NES) of 65 metabolic pathways
  in each age group. (B) Forest plot illustrating the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence
  interval (CI) of each metabolic pathway in the METABRIC population. (C) Venn diagram
  of the intersection between metabolic pathways upregulated in the young group (logit
  (NES) > 0.1) and pathways associated with worse disease-free survival (HR > 1).
  (D) Box plots presenting NES values of intersected metabolic pathways in each age
  group; p-values: Kruskalâ€“Wallis test for multiple comparisons. ** p < 0.01, ***
  p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001, and ns p > 0.05.'
