caption: Co‐expression networks of birch‐allergic patients at baseline and after Bet
  v 1 stimulation. (A) Co‐expression network modules were identified using WGCNA between
  unstimulated birch‐allergic (unstim‐BA) and Bet v 1‐stimulated BA (Bet v 1‐BA) patients.
  Modules were linked to the estimated cell fractions determined by the Cibersort
  (CS) leukocyte deconvolution. Colour represents the correlation coefficient. Only
  correlations with a p‐value<.001 are shown. (B) Modules correlating with the phenotype
  were further analysed for pathway enrichment using ReactomePA. (C/D) Protein–Protein
  Interaction (PPI) networks of enriched modules were built with STRING database (V11.5)
  and visualized using Cytoscape. The CytoHubba plug‐in for Cytoscape was used to
  determine hub genes within each module, which are highlighted in orange. Networks
  were built with the top 200 genes with the highest module membership. Module names
  have been chosen according to involved genes, enriched pathways and hub genes. All
  PPI networks showed an enrichment value of p < 1 × 10−12
