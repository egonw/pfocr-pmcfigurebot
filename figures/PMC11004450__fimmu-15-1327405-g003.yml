caption: 'OGT and many HBP members are increased in AML. (A) Dot plot of OGT and OGA
  expression in LSCs and HSPCs from healthy donors (HD). The scRNA-Seq data is from
  van Galen, P et al. (). (B) Expression levels of HBP members from bulk RNA-sequencing.
  Expression has been normalized using voom. AML: n = 1005, Normal HSPC: n = 13, Normal
  Whole Blood: n = 755, also shown in the legend. DE analysis results are shown where
  p < 0.05. (C) Scatterplot of OGT and OGA expression values in AML (green) and normal
  (orange) samples. ρ = Pearson correlation between OGA and OGT expression. (B, C)
  Data is from TCGA, TARGET, BeatAML, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, GTEx,
  and GSE198919.'
