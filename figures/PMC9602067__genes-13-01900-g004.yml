caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling
  pathway mediated by the NF-κB inhibitor α (IκBα) protein. (a) The constitutive NF-κB
  activation is mediated by the degradation of the IκBα protein. (b) The mutant Ser32Cys
  IκBα protein (star symbol) is speculated to exhibit changes in the post-translational
  modifications. The loss of phosphorylation site at residue 32 and introduction of
  a new sumoylation site at residue 38 may facilitate the nuclear transport of NF-κB
  to the cytoplasm, resulting in the inhibition of NF-κB activation. TLR, toll-like
  receptor; IL1R, interleukin-1 receptor; BCR, B cell receptor; TNFR, tumor necrosis
  factor receptor; EDAR, ectodysplasin A receptor; NEMO, NF-κB essential modulator;
  IKKα, IkappaB kinase α subunit; IKKβ, IkappaB kinase β subunit; NF-κB, nuclear factor
  kappa B; IκBα, NF-κB inhibitor α. Created with BioRender.com, accessed on 30 July
