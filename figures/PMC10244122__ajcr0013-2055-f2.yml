caption: DSF combined with immunochemotherapy remodels the tumor immune microenvironment.
  A. The composition of immune cells in PAN02 cell-derived tumor tissues following
  treatment with DSF and/or immunochemotherapy was analyzed by flow cytometry. B.
  The apoptosis of PANC-1 and BXPC-3 cells induced by treatment with DSF (10 μM) and/or
  immunochemotherapy. C. Heatmap of the expression of cytokines in the treated PAN02-derived
  tumor tissues analyzed by the RNA-seq. D. The mRNA levels of cytokines in the treated
  PAN02-derived tumor tissues evaluated by qRT-PCR analysis. E and F. The mRNA levels
  of IFNα and IFNβ in PDAC cells treated by 5 and 10 μM DSF or 100 nM STING agonist
  (diABZI) for 4 hours as determined by qRT-PCR (**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, NS indicates
  no significance).
