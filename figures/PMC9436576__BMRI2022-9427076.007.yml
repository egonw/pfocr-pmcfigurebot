caption: 'Qingchang Wenzhong decoction (QCWZD) inhibits the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway
  and M1 macrophage polarization. (a–d) RAW264.7 cells treated with 100 ng/mL lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) and 10 ng/mL interferon-γ (IFN-γ) for 24 h, and 0.25 mg/mL and 0.125 mg/mL
  QCWZD, respectively, 2 h prior to treatment with LPS and IFN-γ. Protein levels of
  p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 in the colon tissue determined using western blotting; β-actin
  was used as a reference. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 versus the control group; ∗P < 0.05
  versus the LPS and IFN-γ group. n =3 for each group.'
