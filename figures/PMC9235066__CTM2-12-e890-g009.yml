caption: Signaling pathways and key kinases of neurotransmitters acetylcholine (ACh)
  and norepinephrine (NE) predicted by enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
  (KEGG) pathway analysis and motif analysis. (A) Enriched KEGG pathway analysis was
  performed using the MaxQuant computational platforms for mass spectrometry (MS)‐based
  phosphoproteomics data in the ACh and NE groups. (B) Motif analysis of phosphosites
  and phosphoproteins was used to predict the key kinases of the neurotransmitters
  ACh and NE that regulated the phosphorylation of islet proteins; orange graphs indicate
  that kinase activity was activated, and blue graphs indicate inhibited kinase activity.
  (C) The regulatory relationship between kinases and phosphorylated substrate proteins
  in the ACh and NE groups predicted by motif analysis and presented in the form of
  the network; red phosphosites indicate the hyperphosphorylation, while green indicates
  hypo phosphorylation. (D,E) The expression levels of different kinases of ACh and
  NE predicted by motif analysis were measured by real‐time polymerase chain reaction
  (RT‐PCR) in mouse islets. (F) Isolated mouse pancreatic islets and three types of
  pancreatic islet cell lines (alpha TC1‐6, Min6 and TGP52) under an optical microscope
  (x100 magnification). (G) The heatmaps showing the expression of kinases predicted
  by motif analysis
