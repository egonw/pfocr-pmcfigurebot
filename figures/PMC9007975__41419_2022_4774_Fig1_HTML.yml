figure_title: Degeneration of SGNs and HCs in AHL mice
caption: A Representative ABR waveforms, in response to clicking sound pressure levels,
  in 2- and 9-month-old C57 mice. B ABR thresholds were measured from 2- and 9-month-old
  C57 mice at different frequencies (4–32 kHz). Arrows indicate the threshold exceeding
  the maximum of TDT ABR system. C Representative ABR waveforms of 2- and 9-month-old
  BALB/c mice. D ABR thresholds of 2- and 9-month-old BALB/c mice are indicated. E
  Immunofluorescence showed the morphological changes of HCs in 2- and 9-month-old
  C57 and BALB/c mice. Scale bar, 10 µm. F Quantification of OHCs and IHCs from 2-
  and 9-month-old C57 mice. G DPOAE threshold measurement of 2- and 9-month-old C57
  mice. Arrows indicate the threshold exceeding the maximum of TDT system. H Quantification
  of OHCs and IHCs from 2- and 9-month-old BALB/c mice. I Morphological changes of
  SGNs were observed in the apical, middle, and basal cochlea of 2- and 9-month-old
  BALB/c and C57 mice. Scale bar, 20 µm. J The density of SGNs was quantified in 2-
  and 9-month-old C57 mice and BALB/c mice. Data are represented as means ± SEM, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001.
