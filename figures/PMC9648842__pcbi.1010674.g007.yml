caption: 'A) and D) Time evolution of the FC events fraction for E. coli (blue) and
  S. cerevisiae (red) at low- and high-frequency feeding profiles, respectively. B)
  and E) Time evolution of the relative enzyme (Ψrel) corresponding to each metabolic
  pathway for E. coli at low- and high-frequency feeding profiles, respectively. C)
  and F) Time evolution of the relative enzyme (Ψrel) corresponding to each metabolic
  pathway for S. cerevisiae at low- and high-frequency feeding profiles, respectively.
  Metabolic paths are colour coded as follows: GLU fermentative/unbalanced consumption
  in blue, ACE consumption in yellow, ETH consumption in purple, and GLU oxidative/balanced
  consumption in green.'
article_title: Controlling microbial co-culture based on substrate pulsing can lead
  to stability through differential fitness advantages.
