caption: Identification of proteome changes in DbCM. (a) The amounts of differentially
  expressed proteins by comparing DbCM to CK. (b) KEGG pathway analysis of the DEPs
  belonging to metabolic related pathways of DbCM/CK. Numbers and P values of DEPs
  in each pathway. (c) Venn diagrams showing the 37 overlapped candidates that differentially
  expressed on both RNA level and protein level. (d) Protein-protein interaction network
  analysis on metabolic pathway-related candidates between DbCM and CK.
