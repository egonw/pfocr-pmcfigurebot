caption: Cell–cell interaction between melanoma and immune cell clusters. (A) UMAP
  plot of aggregated immune cells from the GSE115978 dataset. Immune cells are automatically
  annotated with SingleR (R package), based on the Monaco Immune Database. Monocytes,
  dendritic cells, B cells, NK cells, T cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD4+ T cells could
  be identified. (B) Aggregated network of cell–cell communication, based on the total
  number of interactions. (C) Dot plot showing all the significant ligand–receptor
  interactions between cluster 5 and T cell subtypes (T cells, CD8+ T cells and CD4+
  T cells). p < 0.01 was considered as the threshold for significance. (D) Hierarchical
  plot illustrates the communication network of the MHC-I signaling pathway (left).
  A heatmap showing the role (based on CellChat centrality measures) of each cell
  cluster in the MHC-I signaling pathway (right). (E) Hierarchical plot (left) and
  centrality heatmap (right) for MHC-II signaling pathway communication network. (F)
  Chord diagram showing ligand–receptor interactions between cluster 5 and T cell
  subtypes within MHC (I and II) signaling pathways only. (G) Circle plot for IFN-II
  signaling pathway.
