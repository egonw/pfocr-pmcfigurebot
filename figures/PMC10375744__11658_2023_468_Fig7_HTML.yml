caption: MiR-632 promoted β-catenin expression by targeting GSK3β and activated the
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway to promote keratinocyte proliferation and migration.
  A Changes in miR-632 expression in OA-RD17-treated keratinocytes after application
  of MAPK signaling pathway inhibitors for 24 h, detected by RT-qPCR. B Prediction
  of binding sites of miR-632 to GSK3β. C Luciferase reporter assay of miR-632 targeting
  GSK3β. D Effects of miR-632 up-regulation on Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, detected
  by western blotting. E Up-regulation of miR-632 expression significantly inhibited
  expression of GSK3β protein. F–J Up-regulation of miR-632 expression significantly
  promoted expression of β-catenin, nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, Vimentin, Cyclin
  D1, and c-MYC proteins. All data are expressed as mean ± SEM from three independent
  experiments, ns, no significance, ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001
