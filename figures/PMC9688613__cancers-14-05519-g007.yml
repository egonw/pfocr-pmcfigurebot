caption: 'CLEFMA induced apoptotic cell death in OSCC through the up-regulation of
  HO-1. The protein levels of HO-1, cleaved caspase-8, cleaved caspase-9, and cleaved
  caspase-3 were assessed by transfection with non-targeting siRNA (NT) and HO-1 siRNA
  (siHo-1) in (A) HSC-3 and (B) SCC-9 cells through Western blot analysis. The densitometry
  of protein signals was detected (ratio to β-actin). Data are presented as the mean
  ± SD of at least three independent experiments. * p < 0.05 compared with the DMSO
  control transfected with NT; # p < 0.05 compared with the 8 μM CLEFMA treated group
  transfected with NT.'
