caption: Schematic representation of the long-distance (wireless) and direct communications
  involved in managing folliculogenesis and oogenesis in mammals. Organs such as brain
  or thyroid send hormones to the follicle via the bloodstream. By binding to the
  somatic cell receptor of the follicle, the hormone enables its activation and the
  stimulation of its dependant signaling pathways. This endocrine signaling on the
  functions and the development of the follicle cells and the oocyte, without direct
  transmission by physical contact, constitutes a long-distance systemic (wireless)
  inward signaling route (represented by blue-dotted line). Moreover, by secreting
  extracellular vesicles containing miRNA, proteins and RNA, components involved in
  various pathway which are closely related to follicular growth and maturation, granulosa
  cells are another instance of secreted signaling into the local environment. The
  oocyte also actively communicates with its surrounding cells, using secreted factors
  (represented by dark dotted line), which therefore actively regulate the functions
  of the granulosa cells and the cumulus cells, related to growth and differentiation
  of somatic cells. Although much of the dialogue required for folliculogenesis and
  oogenesis occurs through secreted (wireless) communications, some inputs go through
  direct communications (represented by white arrows). This direct communication implies
  a direct transmission via physical contact. These direct material transfers occur
  between granulosa cells using gap junctions and between the oocyte and its surrounding
  cells using TZPs and gap junctions
