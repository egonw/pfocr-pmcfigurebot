caption: TAMs have distinct phenotypes after phagocytosis in acute lung tumor mouse
  models. (A) Schematic of intravenous transplantation of a primary lung tumor cell
  line (KPT; SP110P) into recipient F1 C57BL/6J-129S1/Svlmj mice over a 3-wk time
  course. (B) Flow cytometry gating of CD45pos tdTompos and tdTomneg lung macrophages
  gated on cells at 1, 2, and 3 wk after i.v injection of KPT primary lung tumor cell
  line. (C) Ordinary one-way ANOVA (*, P ≤ 0.05; ***, P ≤ 0.001). Bar plots showing
  the percentage of CD45pos tdTompos cells in the acute lung tumor model after i.v.
  injection. (D) Myeloid cell composition within the tdTompos or tdTomneg immune cell
  fraction in naive and tumor-bearing mice. (E and F) Fold change MFI of immune-modulatory
  and phagocytosis cell surface markers on IMs (E) or AMs (F) relative to naive IMs
  or AMs, respectively. Unpaired t test (*, P ≤ 0.05; **, P ≤ 0.01; ***, P ≤ 0.001).
  (G–J) Pathway enrichment score of immune-activation gene modules (G and H) and tissue-reorganization
  gene modules (I and J) for tdTompos or tdTomneg IMs and AMs based on analysis of
  focused panels of Nanostring mRNA probes. Unpaired t test (*, P ≤ 0.05; **, P ≤
  0.01; ***, P ≤ 0.001; ****, P ≤ 0.0001). Data are representative of at least three
  independent experiments.
