caption: 'MK-2206 inhibited the activation of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in vivo
  and in vitro. (A,B) Expression levels of p-Akt and p-mTOR in the kidneys of each
  group of mice were detected by immunofluorescence staining (scale bar: 50 μm). (C,H)
  Protein expression levels of p-Akt and p-mTOR in vivo were detected by Western blot.
  (D,E) Expression levels of p-Akt and p-mTOR in HK-2 cells were detected by immunofluorescence
  staining (scale bar: 50 μm). (F,I) Western blot was used to detect the protein expression
  levels of p-Akt and p-mTOR in vitro. (G) Immunohistochemical staining of the kidneys
  in each group of mice using p-Akt and p-mTOR (scale bar: 30 μm). Protein levels
  were normalized with GADPH. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01. MU: UUO + MK-2206, MT: TGF-β1
  + MK-2206.'
