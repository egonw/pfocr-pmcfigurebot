caption: 'The heatmaps: (a) Displays the correlation of the 57 statistically significant
  polar metabolites within each cell line. The colors indicate the expression level
  of each individual metabolite in each cell line based on their relative abundance.
  (b) Presents the results of pathway analysis conducted on each cell line sample,
  comparing them to medium bootstrap samples. The colors represent the significance
  based on the âˆ’log(p-value) of each pathway in each cell line. The analysis employed
  the Euclidean correlation index and the complete clustering method.'
