caption: Differential induction of Notch3 by homo/heterotypic interactions leads to
  modulation in proliferation, invasiveness, and cisplatin sensitivity in SNFT. (A,B)
  Bioluminescence images of SNFT individually co-cultured with TOV21G, OAW42, A2780,
  and OVCAR3 cell lines naturally expressing different levels of Jag1, which led to
  differential Notch3 promoter activity as represented by the bar diagram (n = 3).
  Co-culturing with TOV21G showed comparable luciferase activity (9111 ± 458.28 p/s/cm2/sr)
  to SNFT. (C,D) The proliferation index was calculated by FlowJo software and plotted
  as a line graph which indicated heterogeneity in the proliferation rate of SNFT
  post-co-culture with different NIH3T3-Jagged1 expressing clones and EOC cell lines.
  The maximum increase in SNFT proliferation was found after NIH3T3J1-A co-culture
  (12.3-fold, p < 0.001) and post OVCAR3 co-culture (7.7-fold, p < 0.001) on day2.
  (E,F) Immunofluorescence images of Ki-67 staining, a nuclear marker for cell proliferation
  in SNFT cells sorted after co-culturing with various EOC cells and Jagged-1 expressing
  NIH3T3 clones labelled with CFSE (E). Graphical comparison of the overall distribution
  of Ki-67 labelled SNFT cells exhibited maximal induction after co-culture with OVCAR3
  cells, followed by NIH3T3J1-A and OAW42 cells. NIH3T3wt also induced Ki-67 expression
  SNFT but not significantly (n = 2). * p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤ 0.001. (G,H)
  The epifluorescence images represent the invaded SNFT cells (green) after co-culture
  (G). The highest invasion was observed in SNFT co-cultured with NIH3T3J1-A, followed
  by OVCAR3, OAW42, and NIH3T3J1-D (H) (n = 3). (I,J) The result of the MTT assay
  was plotted as drug concentration vs. percentage cell survival in a line graph which
  showed that across different co-culture conditions NIH3T3J1-A and OVCAR3 imparted
  the highest cisplatin resistance in SNFT, which gradually decreased with OAW42,
  NIH3T3J1-D, and NIH3T3Wt co-cultures. The IC50 doses of SNFT alone and after co-culture
  with different cells are presented in the table (n = 3). * p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01,
  *** p ≤ 0.001.
