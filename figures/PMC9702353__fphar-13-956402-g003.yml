caption: 'Effects of FLaAN/C on inflammation in mice with EAE. (A) H&E staining was
  performed on paraffin-embedded mouse spinal cord sections (scale bars: 100 μm).
  (B–E) The mRNA expression of IL-6 (B), IL-8 (C), TNF-α (D), and IL-10 (E) were quantitated
  by qRT-PCR. (F–I) Serum levels of IL-6 (F), IL-8 (G), TNF-α (H), IL-10 (I) were
  measured by ELISA. (J–M) The mRNA expression of IL-18 (J), IL-1β (K), IFN-γ (L),
  and IL-17 (M) were quantitated by qRT-PCR. (N–Q) Serum levels of IL-18 (N), IL-1β
  (O), IFN-γ (P), and IL-17 (Q) were measured by ELISA. Data are shown as means ±
  SD (n = 6 per group). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01,
  ###p < 0.001. * vs. Control group; # vs. MOG group.'
