caption: 'LC3II/LC3I, ATG7 protein expression in the spinal dorsal horn at 7 days
  after intervention. (a) Western blot assay of LC3II/LC3I, ATG7 protein. (b) Relative
  protein band densitier of LC3II/LC3I, ATG7. The densities of the protein bands were
  analyzed and normalized to β‐actin. * p<.05, vs. sham group; #p <.05, vs. CRS group;
  +p <.05, vs. CSR + DM group. SB, Act A inhibitor SB‐431542; 3‐MA, PI3K inhibitor;
  DM, direct moxibustion; CSR, cervical spondylotic radiculopathy'
article_title: Direct moxibustion exerts an analgesic effect on cervical spondylotic
  radiculopathy by increasing autophagy via the Act A/Smads signaling pathway.
