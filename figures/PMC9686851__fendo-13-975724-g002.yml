caption: 'Effects of MCDD on body weight and organ index of rats. (A) The body weight
  change curve of the rats in each group for six consecutive weeks. (B) The body weight
  difference diagram of the rats in the six groups on the sixth week. (C) The average
  free food intake energy of the six groups of rats was counted every day. After sacrifice,
  the weight of ovary, uterus, and abdominal fat were weighed, and the ratio to body
  weight was (D) ovarian index. (E) ovarian volume (mm3) = (π/6) × long diameter (mm)
  × short diameter 2 (mm2). (F) uterine index. (G) abdominal fat index of rats. The
  above results are expressed as mean ± SEM, n= 8~12. ***P < 0.001, *P < 0.05, vs.
  control group, ###P < 0.001, ##P < 0.01, #P < 0.05, vs. model group.'
