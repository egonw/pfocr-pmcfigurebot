caption: DCN promotes decidual M1-like macrophage polarization via mitochondrial dysfunction
  resulting in the occurrence of RPL. (A) Aberrant high levels of DCN, which is secreted
  by DSCs and induced by progesterone and estrogen, lead to the dysfunction of decidual
  macrophages in the decidua of women with RPL. Dysfunction of decidual macrophages
  is characterized by an increasing proportion of M1-like macrophages, accompanied
  by TNFα and IL-1β production. Notably, this polarization to M1-like macrophages
  is related to increasing mitochondrial membrane potential and glycolysis, promoting
  mitochondrial fission mediated by DRP1, enhancing ROS production, and activating
  the MyD88-NF-κB signaling pathway. (B) Transfer of DCN-treated BMDMs increases the
  mouse embryo absorption during early pregnancy, accompanied by impaired fetal vascularization.
