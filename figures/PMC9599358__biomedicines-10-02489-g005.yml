caption: 'Mevalonate supplementation is able to restore mutp53 expression and to prevent
  DNA damage in pancreatic cancer cells undergoing c-Myc inhibition. PaCa44 and PT45
  cells were treated with cMyc inhibitor (i-cMyc) (50 μM) or MEV (20 μM) or with both
  for 48 h to evaluate p53 (A), ATM and γH2AX (B) expression by Western blot analyses.
  βActin was used as loading control and one representative experiment is shown. The
  histograms represent the mean ± SD of densitometric analysis of the ratio of p53/Act,
  ATM/Act and γH2AX /Act; p value: * <0.05; ** <0.01; *** <0.001; **** <0.0001.'
