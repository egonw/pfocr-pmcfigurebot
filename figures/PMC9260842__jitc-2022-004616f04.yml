caption: SCD1 is involved in the production of CCL4 and the infiltration of immune
  cells into tumors via β-catenin and ER stress. (A) C57BL/6 mice bearing DsRed-MC38
  tumors were treated with SCDinh or with vehicle after which DsRed+ tumor cells (upper
  panel) and CD8+ T cells (lower panel) were isolated at day 20. Total RNA was extracted
  and CCL4 and ATF3 gene expression was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. (B) Heat map
  of 57 colorectal tumors classified focusing on immune related genes, fatty acid
  metabolism related genes and β-catenin pathway genes (dataset 1). (C) Comparison
  of expression levels of genes of interest (CD8A, β-catenin pathway genes (CTNNB1,
  VEGFA, TCF12), SCD, CCL4, CD141 and XCR1) in Group 1 (hot tumor; n=27) and in Group
  4 (cold tumor; n=24). (D) Correlation analysis of β-catenin pathway (dataset 2)
  with SCD, CD8A and XCR1 in Group 1 (hot tumor) and in Group 4 (cold tumor). (E)
  sXbp1/uXbp1 ratio, Ddit3, Hspa5, Atf4 and Atf6 mRNA levels in DsRed+ tumor cells
  (upper panel) and tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells (lower panel) in C57BL/6 mice
  bearing DsRed-MC38. Data are expressed as means ± SD (n=3). *P<0.05, **P<0.01.
article_title: Inhibition of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) enhances the antitumor
  T cell response through regulating β-catenin signaling in cancer cells and ER stress
  in T cells and synergizes with anti-PD-1 antibody.
