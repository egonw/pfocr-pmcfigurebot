caption: The roles and mechanisms of SLC3A2 in LUAD and LUSC cells. (A) The proportion
  of apoptotic cells (early apoptosis) was determined by double staining with Annexin-V/FITC
  and PI. (B) Western blot analysis of the ERK/MEK signaling pathway. GAPDH was used
  as an internal loading control. (C) Methylation status of SLC3A2 in LUAD and LUSC
  cells was checked using 5-AzaC. Uncropped WB images are shown in .
article_title: Both In Situ and Circulating SLC3A2 Could Be Used as Prognostic Markers
  for Human Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Lung Adenocarcinoma.
