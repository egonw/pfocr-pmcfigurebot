caption: 'Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis
  on light stress-induced up-/downregulation of expressed proteins is divided into
  three categories of Go Term, including GO function and ID, Protein count, and Enrichment
  fold change. Panels (A–C) represent the up-/downregulation of proteins induced by
  WT-500 vs. W-50 (A), pgrl1-500 vs. W-50 (B), and pgr5-500 vs. W-50 (C) treatment
  versus control. BP1 -5, biological process; MF1 -5, molecular function; CC1 -5,
  cellular components The top three biological pathways were presented as KEGG pathways
  as follows for upregulated, downregulated, and differentially regulated proteins:
  (1) BP1 (biological process), Photosynthesis; BP2, Photosynthesis, light reaction;
  BP3, Photosynthesis, dark reaction; BP4, chlorophyll biosynthetic process; BP5,
  photosynthetic electron transport chain; (2) MF1 (molecular function), chlorophyll-binding;
  MF2, tetrapyrrole binding; MF3, H+ ion transmembrane transporter activity; MF4,
  cation binding; MF5, four iron, four sulfur cluster binding; (3) CC1-5 (cellular
  components)—chloroplast, chloroplast thylakoid membrane, photosystems, cell and
  cell part, and membrane protein complex. However, the KEGG pathway represents the
  top three pathways in differentially abundant proteins involved in photosynthesis,
  porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, and metabolic pathways.'
