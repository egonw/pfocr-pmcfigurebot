caption: 'KEGG pathway image of plant hormonal signal transduction DEGs related to
  plant growth in A. thaliana plants treated with Acinetobacter sp. C32I. Relative
  transcript abundance of genes of plant growth-related hormones after four weeks
  interaction with bacterium compared to the uninoculated control. The DEGs coding
  for each gene family are represented by boxes. Identified genes related to hormone
  transduction pathways related to Auxin [AUX], Cytokinin [CK], Brassinosteroid [BR],
  and Salicylic Acid [SA] synthesis. Red boxes represent up-regulated genes and blue
  boxes represent down-regulated genes. IAA: indole acetic acid, ARF: auxin response
  factor, GH3: Gretchen Hagen 3, SAUR: small auxin upregulated, BSK: brassinosteroid-signaling
  kinase, CYCD3: D-type cyclin, CRE1: cytokinin response 1, AHP: histidine phosphotransfer,
  B_ARR: Arabidopsis response regulator type B, A_ARR: Arabidopsis response regulator
  type A, TGA: TGACG-binding factors, PR1: protein pathogenesis-related'
article_title: Bacteria from the skin of amphibians promote growth of Arabidopsis
  thaliana and Solanum lycopersicum by modifying hormone-related transcriptome response.
