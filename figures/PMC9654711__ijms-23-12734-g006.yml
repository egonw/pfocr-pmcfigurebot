caption: 'Comparison of BDNF’s and LMDS compound’s signaling activation. (A) Assessment
  of DsRed fluorescence and ROS in ∆K280 tauRD-DsRed cells uninduced, untreated, treated
  with BDNF at 10–100 ng/mL, or LMDS-1, -2 at 5–10 µM (n = 3). The relative DsRed
  fluorescence of untreated cells (Untr) or ROS of uninduced cells (Unind) were normalized
  (100%). (B) Assessment of p-TRKB (Y516/Y817), TRKB, p-CREB (S133), CREB, p-JNK (T183/Y185)
  and JNK levels with BDNF (100 ng/mL) or LMDS-1, -2 (10 µM) treatment by immunoblot
  using GAPDH as a loading control (n = 3). To normalize, protein expression level
  in untreated cells was set at 100%. p values: comparisons between induced vs. uninduced
  cells (#: p < 0.05, ##: p < 0.01), or compound-treated vs. untreated cells (*: p
  < 0.05, **: p < 0.01, ***: p < 0.001) (one-way ANOVA with a post hoc Tukey test).'
