caption: Arginine and proline metabolism pathway with associated metabolite ion mages
  by IR-MALDESI. Metabolite conversions with detected proteins are shown with ion
  images and purple or white circles along conversion arrows. The intensity of ion
  images indicates higher or lower abundance of metabolite detection. Circles along
  the pathway highlight detection or absence of proteins in the same patients. Disease
  cohorts for each ion are separated by color in each ion image (orange, green, and
  pink for sALS, Control, and C9Pos, respectively).
