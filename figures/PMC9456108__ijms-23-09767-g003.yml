caption: 'Generation and functional annotation of genomic patterns associated with
  iron deficiency. (A) Venn diagram showing the intersection of differentially expressed
  genes in the ferroptosis cluster. (B) Forest plot demonstrating univariate Cox analysis
  of genes associated with ferroptosis molecular subtypes. (C) Kaplanâ€“Meier survival
  curves for the three gene clusters. (D) Heat map illustrating the relationship between
  the ferroptosis molecular subtype-associated gene expression, ferroptosis clusters,
  and various clinicopathological features. (E) Box plots depicting the levels of
  immune infiltration of the three genomic patterns. ns: not significant; * p < 0.05;
  ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001. (F,G) Differences in stromal activation pathway (F)
  and carcinogenesis-related pathways (G) in the three gene clusters. ns: not significant;
  * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001.'
