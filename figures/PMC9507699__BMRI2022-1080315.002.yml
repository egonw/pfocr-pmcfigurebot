caption: Expression prolife of TGF-β1 pathway and MAPK pathway in different HOXB9
  expressed HCC tissues. (A) Immunohistochemistry was performed to measure the expression
  of p-Smad2 in different HOXB9 expressed HCC tissues (200× magnification for the
  whole picture and 400× magnification for that at top right corner). (a) p-Smad2
  in nontumor tissues; (b) p-Smad2 in low HOXB9 expressed HCC tissues; (c) p-Smad2
  in moderate HOXB9 expressed HCC tissues; (d) p-Smad2 in high HOXB9 expressed HCC
  tissues; (e–f) negative control for nontumor tissues and HCC tissues, respectively.
  (B) Semiquantitative analysis of p-Smad2 by Immunohistochemistry in tissues from
  different HOXB9 expressed HCC tissues and nontumor. (C–D) Western blot was used
  to detect the expression of TGF-β1 signaling pathway (including Smad7, Smurf2, TGF-β1,
  and p-Smad2) in different HOXB9 expressed HCC tissues and nontumor. (E–F) Western
  blot was used to detect the expression of MAPK signaling pathway (including ERK1/2,
  p-38, and JNK pathway) in different HOXB9 expressed HCC tissues and nontumor. ∗P
  < 0.05 vs. nontumor.
