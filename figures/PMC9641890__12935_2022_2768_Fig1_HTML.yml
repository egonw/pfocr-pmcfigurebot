caption: WGCNA analysis based on LNR in pancreatic cancer patients. A High LNR correlates
  with a poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients (P = 0.002). B Network topology
  analysis for soft-thresholding powers. X-axis indicates various soft-thresholding
  powers. Y-axis means the correlation coefficient between log [P(k)] and log (k).
  The red line represents correlation coefficient = 0.9. C Mean network connectivity
  under distinct soft-thresholding powers. D Clustering all included genes into modules
  based on the topological overlap, assigning them into different colors. E Module-trait
  associations. The number in box is correlation coefficient, the number in brackets
  represents corresponding P value. Red indicates high positive correlation, whereas
  blue means negative correlation. F Bar plots showed blue and green modules are two
  most key modules related to LNR. G, H Scatterplots exhibited the module membership
  of genes versus high LNR in green and blue modules
