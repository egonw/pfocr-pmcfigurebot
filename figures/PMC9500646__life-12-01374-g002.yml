caption: 'Effects of TG (5, 10 µg) and TG10 + PBA on distance traveled in the water
  maze training trials. In the TG10-treated group, the traveled distance is greater
  during days 1 and 2 of training. * p < 0.001 versus the control group. # p < 0.001
  versus the TG10 group. Data are represented as mean ± SEM (N = 7–9). Thapsigargin
  (TG), 4-Phenylbutyric acid (PBA).'
