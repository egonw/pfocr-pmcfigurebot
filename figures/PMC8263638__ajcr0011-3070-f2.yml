caption: Association of six cell proliferation-related pathway scores with cell proliferation
  parameters, immune cytolytic activity, and pathological complete resection in the
  TCGA cohort. A. Correlation plots of cell proliferation-related pathway scores with
  MKI67 expression, Proliferation score, and Cytolytic Activity score (CYT). Spearman’s
  rank correlation was used for the analysis. B. Bar plots of the comparison of the
  low and high score group with R0 resection ratio. Fisher’s test was use for the
  analysis. The median value was used as a cut-off to divide low and high groups for
  each pathway. G2M, G2M Checkpoint; E2F, E2F Targets; MYC1, MYC Targets V1; MYC2,
  MYC Targets V2; Mitotic, Mitotic Spindle; p53, p53 pathway.
article_title: G2M checkpoint pathway alone is associated with drug response and survival
  among cell proliferation-related pathways in pancreatic cancer.
