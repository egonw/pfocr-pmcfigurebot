caption: PF-04691502 induces upregulation of PTEN, which is responsible for the inhibition
  of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in bladder cancer cells. (a) T-24 and 5637 cells were
  treated with the indicated doses of PF-04691502 for 24 h and the levels of PTEN
  were measured using western blotting. (b) T-24 and 5637 cells were transfected with
  scrambled negative control (si-NC) or si-PTEN for 12 h and then, the cells were
  treated with or without PF-04691502 for another 24 h and cellular lysates were subjected
  to western blot analysis with indicated antibodies. (c) T-24 and 5637 cells were
  treated as described above, and cellular apoptosis was measured. (d) T-24 and 5637
  cells were treated as described above, and caspase-3 levels were measured. (e) T-24
  and 5637 cells were treated as described above, and cellular viabilities were measured.
  Data are representative of at least three independent experiments (∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P
  < 0.01).
