caption: vtRNA1-1 regulates apoptosis and autophagy in cancer cells. In most studied
  cell lines (HeLa, BL41, BL2, A549, HEK293 and Hs578T), vtRNA1-1 is a pro-survival
  factor that inhibits apoptosis most likely through the regulation of the PI3K/Akt
  and ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathways (red arrow). The important nucleotides in the
  central domain of vtRNA1-1 for apoptosis resistance are encircled in red [,]. In
  variance, in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Huh-7), vtRNA1-1 does not affect apoptosis
  but positively regulates autophagy via the MAPK/TFEB signaling pathway that modulates
  the expression of the CLEAR network genes (black T-bars and arrows). This ensures
  the biogenesis of catabolically active lysosomes (acidic pH) capable of fusing with
  autophagosomes to form active autolysosomes []. Moreover, vaultRNA1-1 is able to
  inhibit p62 oligomerization and has been suggested to regulate the available cargo
  of ubiquitinated proteins for the autophagosome (green T-bar) [,]. The relevant
  residues on vtRNA1-1 for this proposed role are encircled in green.
