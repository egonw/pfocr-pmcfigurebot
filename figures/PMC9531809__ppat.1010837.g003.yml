figure_title: Pirk-like expression is regulated by 20E signaling
caption: (A) Heat map of transcriptional patterns of the IMD pathway component genes
  during PBM phases. Gene expression at each time point was normalized to PE 72 h.
  (B) Protein levels of PGRP-LC and Rel2 determined using western blots. For each
  time point, both cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extracts were prepared from ten
  female mosquito fat bodies. GAPDH and Histone H3 were used as controls. (C) Putative
  EcRE of the IMD pathway inhibitors aligned with reported Aedes EcRE sequences. The
  three core amino acids are highlighted with yellow. (D) Heatmap showing the expression
  pattern of 25 IMD inhibitor genes in iEcR mosquitoes compared with iEGFP mosquitoes
  upon E. cloacae infection. (E) mRNA abundance of Pirk-like in iEcR mosquitoes infected
  by E. cloacae. Bar plots are shown as mean ± SEM. ****p < 0.0001 (one-way ANOVA
  followed by Bartlett’s test). Data are from three biological replicates. (F) mRNA
  abundance of Pirk-like in Aag2 cells co-transfected EcR and USP. (G) Expression
  of Pirk-like and EcR in the PE and PBM phases. Dot plots represent mean ± SEM. Data
  are from three biological replicates.
