caption: The cell activity scores of cell clusters. (a) The score of the IRG set.
  The threshold was 0.26, and the active scores of 7176 cells exceeded the threshold.
  (b) The UMAP dimensional plot according to the active score of each cell cluster.
  (c–f) GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses of DEGs in high and low active cell
  clusters. GSEA for pathways in KEGG includes systemic lupus erythematosus, cytokine–cytokine
  receptor interaction, primary immunodeficiency, and ribosome. GSEA for molecular
  function in GO includes MHC class II receptor activity, immunoglobulin binding,
  IGG binding, immunoglobulin receptor binding, and signaling adaptor activity. GSEA
  for biological process in GO includes T cell activation via T cell receptor contact
  with antigen bound to MHC molecule on antigen presenting, B cell homeostasis, and
  endogenous peptide antigen via MHC class I tap independent. GSEA for cellular component
  in GO includes MHC class II protein complex, large ribosomal subunit, MHC class
  I protein complex, immunoglobulin complex, and immunoglobulin complex circulating.
