caption: Functional analysis of HBV preS mutations. (A) (left) Differential expressed
  genes (DEGs) in preS1/preS2/S mutant-injected SB mice vs. WT preS1/preS2/S-injected
  SB mice (n = 1377). (right) DEGs in HBV preS1/preS2/S mutant-expressing Huh7 cells
  vs. HBV preS1/preS2/S WT-expressing Huh7 cells (n = 440). p values and fold changes
  were calculated by nbinom Test. (B) The mRNA levels of WNT4 in Huh7 cells which
  is detected by qRT-PCR. (left) Ectopic expression of HBV preS1/preS2/S mutants has
  no direct effect on the mRNA expression of WNT4. (right) Effects of IL-5 and IL-6
  (100 ng/mL, 1 h), two preS1/preS2/S mutant-induced cytokines, on the mRNA expression
  of WNT4. p values were calculated by Studentâ€™s t-test. (C) Most of the inflammation-
  and immune response-related GO terms were significantly enriched in DEGs that were
  identified specifically in SB mice (mice-DEGs) rather than in DEGs identified both
  in SB mice and Huh7 cells (common-DEGs). (D) ER stress-, STAT pathway-, and hypoxia-related
  GO terms were significantly enriched in common-DEGs, rather than in the mice-DEGs.
  (E) Most of the KEGG identified metabolism-related pathways significantly enriched
  in common-DEGs, rather than in the mice-DEGs.
