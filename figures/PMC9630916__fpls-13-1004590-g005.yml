caption: Expression characteristics of hormone signaling related genes in stem growth
  and development of CC and its AACC. (A) Response of auxin, cytokinin, gibberellin
  and abscisic acid signal transduction genes in stem growth and development of CC
  and AACC. (B) Heatmap of the expressed genes assigned to hormone signal transduction
  pathway in the six stem transcriptomes including CC_28, CC_42, CC_BS, AACC_28, AACC_42,
  and AACC_BS. The log-transformed expression values range from -2 to 3. Red and blue
  colors indicate up-regulated and down-regulated transcripts, respectively.
