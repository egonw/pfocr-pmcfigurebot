caption: Effects of the RISK pathway inhibition on the sialidase-3 mediated cardioprotective
  effects. (A) WB analysis of phospho-Akt (Thr308) and total-Akt in scramble and OX-Neu3
  cells treated with LY294002. Calnexin was used as a housekeeper to normalize protein
  expression; (B) ratio between phospho-Akt (Thr308) and total-Akt. The levels of
  Akt activation, at each time point analyzed, have been expressed as relative quantity
  using either LY294002-untreated SCR or OX-Neu3 cells exposed to IRI in vitro as
  internal reference control (CTRL dashed line); (C) analysis of cell growth of scramble
  and OX-Neu3 cells treated with LY294002 and exposed to IRI. Data are expressed as
  relative quantity (%) compared to either SCR or OX-Neu3 cells at the beginning of
  IRI exposure (Time 0 dashed line); (D) analysis of apoptosis level of scramble and
  OX-Neu3 cells treated with LY294002 and exposed to IRI. Results are expressed as
  percentage of apoptotic nuclei per total nuclei; (E) WB analysis of phospho-Erk1/2
  (Thr202/Tyr204) and total Erk1/2 in both scramble and OX-Neu3 cells treated with
  PD98059. Calnexin was used as a housekeeper to normalize protein expression; (F)
  ratio between phospho-Erk1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) and total Erk1/2. The levels of Erk1/2
  activation, at each time point analyzed, have been expressed as relative quantity
  using either PD98059-untreated SCR or OX-Neu3 cells exposed to IRI in vitro as internal
  reference control (CTRL dashed line); (G) cell growth analysis of scramble and OX-Neu3
  cells treated with PD98059 and exposed to IRI. Data are expressed as relative quantity
  (%) compared to either SCR or OX-Neu3 cells at the beginning of IRI exposure (Time
  0 dashed line); (H) apoptosis analysis of scramble and OX-Neu3 cells treated with
  PD98059 and exposed to IRI. Results are expressed as percentage of apoptotic nuclei
  per total nuclei. Each square in the graphs represent an experimental replicate.
  Statistical significance was determined by the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test.
  * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01.
