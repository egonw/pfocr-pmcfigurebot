caption: (A). Fetal bovine serum starvation of human hFOC osteoblasts (negative control,
  grown in media without FBS) significantly (p < 0.01) reduced osteoblast viability
  as compared with hFOB osteoblasts grown in media containing 10% FBS (positive control,
  grown in media containing 10% FBS); n = 6, squares and circles represent data points.
  (B). IPA analysis of the effects of serum starvation (negative controls) as compared
  with positive control osteoblasts on differential gene expression (DGE) in the apoptosis
  canonical pathways. (C). POG (1 μg/mL) treatment of negative control osteoblasts
  increased cell viability, measured using the CellTiter-Glo 2.0 assay. (D). IPA analysis
  of DGE showed reduced apoptosis canonical pathway signaling after treatment with
  POG. (E). RES (1 μg/mL) treatment of negative control osteoblasts increased cell
  viability and reduced apoptosis. (F). IPA analysis of the effects of serum starvation
  (negative controls) versus osteoblasts grown in media containing RES on DGE in the
  apoptosis canonical pathway. DGE data were analyzed by Ingenuity® Pathways Analysis
  (IPA), with analysis criteria of FC of <−1 and >1 and FDR < 0.05, using Fisher’s
  exact test (p < 0.05) to determine a significant correlation of canonical pathways
  with DGEs. Red/pink colors represent significant gene upregulation, and blue/green
  colors represent significant downregulation of genes. The ENSEMBL database was used
  to determine DGE enrichment in specific canonical pathways. Osteoblast viability
  was measured using the CellTiter-Glo® assay, and apoptosis activity was measured
  using the ApoTox-Glo™ triplex assay. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad/Prism
  10.0 using the student T-test, **** p < 0.0001.
