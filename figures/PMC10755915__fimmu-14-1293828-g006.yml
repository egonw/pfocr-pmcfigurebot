caption: Soluble CD83 induces phenotypical, functional, and metabolic changes in human
  monocyte-derived Mφ. Administration of sCD83 to Mφ differentiation results in upregulation
  of pro-resolving receptors (CD163, ILT-2, ILT-4, ILT-5), whereas activation markers
  including MSR-1 or MHC-II are downregulated, which results in less T-cell stimulatory
  capacity of sCD83-differentiated Mφ. Administration of sCD83 to Mφ differentiation
  results in profound changes in transcriptome, including induction of pathways associated
  with alternative activation as well as liver X receptor pathway activation in Mφ.
  To this end, Mφ treated with sCD83 show increased expression of transcription factors
  KLF4, PPARG, and LXRA, which are characteristic for human alternatively activated
  Mφ. In line with that, sCD83-treated Mφ show enhanced levels of well-characterized
  target genes, such as CD36, KLF-4, CYP27A1, ABCA1, ABCG1, and ORM1, indicating modulation
  of the lipid metabolic state of sCD83-differentiated Mφ, which results in less lipid
  load. In summary, we present for the first time data on modulation of human Mφ by
  sCD83, which represents a further preclinical step for the development of sCD83
  as a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of inflammatory conditions.
