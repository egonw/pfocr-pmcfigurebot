caption: 'Parathyroid hormone-related peptide increases Met phosphorylation and activation
  through Src kinase in HCT116 cells. A: Cells were exposed to 10-8 mol/L parathyroid
  hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) 10-8 mol/L for 3 min, 5 min, and 10 min. The protein
  levels of Met and p-Met (phosphorylated in the residues Tyr1234 and Tyr1235) were
  assessed by Western blot to investigate whether PTHrP is capable of modulating Met
  phosphorylation and activation in HCT116 cells. Graph bars represent the average
  of the results obtained from three independent experiments; B: Cells were pre-treated
  with PP1, a selective Src inhibitor, for 30 min and then exposed to 10-8 mol/L PTHrP
  for 3 min to evaluate whether Src kinase mediates the effect of PTHrP on Met activation
  in HCT116 cells. Controls were run by adding an equivalent volume of DMSO, the vehicle
  of the inhibitor. The protein levels of p-Met and Met were evaluated by Western
  blot. Graph bars represent the average of the results obtained from three independent
  experiments. In all experiments, GAPDH protein levels were determined as a control
  of the amount of proteins present in the membrane, since this protein is not substantially
  modified with the treatment by the cytokine. DMSO: Dimethylsulfoxide; GAPDH: Glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate dehydrogenase; Met: Receptor tyrosine kinase Met; p-Me: Phospho-Met
  (Tyr1234/1235); PTHrP: Parathyroid hormone-related peptide. aP < 0.05; bP < 0.01.'
