caption: The risk score of hypoxia-related lncRNA was associated with immunotherapy,
  microsatellite instability and tumor mutation burden in EC. a–d The response to
  anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 treatment between different risk score group. e, f The
  relationship between hypoxia-related lncRNA risk score and microsatellite instability
  in EC patients. g The tumor mutation burden levels in different risk score group.
  h The Pearson correlation coefficients between tumor mutation burden levels and
  risk scores. i, j Kaplan–Meier analysis showed the correlation between tumor mutation
  burden and EC prognosis (i), and the difference in survival rate according to risk
  score between different TMB subgroups (j)
