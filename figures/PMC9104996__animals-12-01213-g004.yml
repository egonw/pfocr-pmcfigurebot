caption: DLPC activation promoted apoptosis via progestogen signaling. (A) The viability
  of granulosa cells was shown by CCK-8 assay in different treatments. (B) Representative
  images of apoptosis with annexin V-FITC staining by a flow cytometry instrument
  in 50 μM DLPC-, 50 μM DLPC + 5 μM P4-, 50 μM DLPC + 10 μM P4-, 50 μM DLPC + 100
  μM P4-exposed granulosa cells. (C) The percentage of apoptosis in the different
  treatment groups. (D) Western blotting of Bcl2 and cleaved-caspase 3 in granulosa
  cells by treatment with 50 μM DLPC, 50 μM DLPC + 1 μM P4, 50 μM DLPC + 5 μM P4,
  50 μM DLPC + 10 μM P4 and 50 μM DLPC + 100 μM P4, respectively. (E,F) The ratios
  of Bcl-2 to β-actin, cleaved-caspase 3 to β-actin expression were normalized, and
  the values were shown, respectively. Data are shown as the means ± SEM of three
  biological replicates. Values with different letters (a, b, c) indicate significant
  differences in bars (p < 0.05). ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, comparing the indicated
  groups.
