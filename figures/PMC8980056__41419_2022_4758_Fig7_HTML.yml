figure_title: Schematic representation of the RAGE–TXNIP pathway implicated in microglia
  dysfunction in an AD contest
caption: RAGE–TXNIP drives Aβ from the cell surface to mitochondria, leading to Drp1
  oligomerization and translocation to mitochondria. These events lead to NLRP3 complex
  formation, resulting in caspase-1 activation, which in turn results in IL-1β secretion
  and GSDMD cleavage, producing CTD and PFD. The Pore Forming Domain (PFD) of cleaved
  GSDM assembles at the plasma membrane, inducing pyroptosis. RAGE receptor for advanced
  glycation endproducts. TXNIP thioredoxin-interacting protein. AD Alzheimer’s disease.
  Aβ Amyloid-beta peptide. Drp1 Dynamin-related protein 1, NLRP3 NOD-like receptor
  family, pyrin domain containing 3. Pro-IL-1β pro-interleukin 1 beta, IL-1β interleukin
  1 beta, GSDMD gasdermin D, CTD C terminal domain (of GSDMD), PFD pore-forming domain.
