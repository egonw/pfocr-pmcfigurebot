caption: Heme metabolism pathway. ALA is normally synthetized in the mitochondrial
  matrix by combining glycine with succinyl-CoA in a reaction catalyzed by ALA synthase
  (ALAS). After passing into the cytoplasm, ALA is converted into coproporphyrinogen
  III (CPGIII) as a result of numerous changes. Exogenously administered 5-ALA is
  delivered to the cytoplasm of cells by peptide transporter 1 and 2 (PEPT1 and PEPT2).
  CPGIII is transported to the intermembrane space of mitochondria where it is converted
  by coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPOX) to protoporphyrinogen IX (PPGIX) and then in
  the mitochondrial matrix to PpIX by protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPOX). Next, ferrochelatase
  (FECH) leads to the formation of heme by incorporating iron into PpIX. PpIX and
  heme can be released from the cell via the ABCG2 transporter. Heme in the cell is
  used to create hemoproteins or it is degraded by heme oxygenase (HO), leading to
  the release of biliverdin, CO, and Fe2+. Iron ions may be bound and stored by ferritin.
  Biliverdin is converted to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase (BVR). ABCB10—ABC subfamily
  B member 10; ALAD—5-aminolevulinic acid synthase dehydratase; HMB—hydroxymethylbilane;
  MFRN—mitoferrin; PBG—porphobilinogen; PBGD—porphobilinogen deaminase; PBR—peripheral-type
  benzodiazepine receptor; SLC25A38—solute carrier family member 38; TCA—tricarboxylic
  acid; UPGIII—uroporphyrinogen III; UROD—uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase; UROS—uroporphyrinogen
  III synthase.
