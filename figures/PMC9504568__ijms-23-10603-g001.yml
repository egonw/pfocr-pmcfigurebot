caption: Effects of PEDV infection on inflammatory cytokine expression in IPEC-J2
  cells. IPEC-J2 cells were infected with PEDV (1 MOI) for 1 h, and then the cells
  were washed with PBS and cultured with fresh culture medium for different times.
  After this, the cells were collected for RT-qPCR (A–C), n = 4 and Western blotting
  analysis (D). a,b,c,d Means not sharing the same superscript differ at p < 0.05.
