caption: 'miR-320e inhibited the Wnt/β-catenin pathway through targeting Wnt2. A and
  B: Cell transfection images were shown; C-E: The Western-Blot results showed that
  the expression of Wnt2, FZD2, Axin2, GSK3β, and β-catenin in the miR-320e mimics
  group was inhibited compared to that in the control group, while this inhibition
  was effectively blocked by Wnt2 silencing compared to the siRNA control; F and G:
  The results of real-time PCR showed similar trends to the protein levels of Wnt2,
  FZD2, Axin2, GSK3β, and β-catenin with overexpressed miR-320e and knockdown of Wnt2.
  PCR: Polymerase chain reaction. aP < 0.05.'
