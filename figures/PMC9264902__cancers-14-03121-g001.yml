caption: Identification of MeDEGs in HGSOC. (A). The intersection of the upregulated
  DEGs in the above four expression profiles; the red flower indicates the 995 genes
  that were upregulated in at least three of the expression profiling datasets. (B).
  The intersection of the downregulated DEGs in the above four expression profiles;
  the red flower indicates the 989 genes that were downregulated in at least three
  of the expression profiling datasets. (C). The overlap of hypermethylated DMGs and
  downregulated DEGs. (D). The overlap of hypomethylated DMGs and upregulated DEGs.
  (E). The top 47 hub genes with the highest connectivity, the color of the node indicates
  the connectivity in the PPI network, and the redder the color is, the greater the
  connectivity. (F). The KEGG analysis of the top 47 hub MeDEGs showed that the 47
  hub genes were mainly enriched in the cell cycle pathway. (G,H). The GO analysis
  of the top 47 hub MeDEGs in biological processes (BP) showed that the 47 hub genes
  were mainly enriched in the cell cycle pathway; a total of 44 genes were enriched
  in the cell cycle pathway, including UBE2C.
