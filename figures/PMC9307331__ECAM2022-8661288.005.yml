caption: Loureirin A promotes apoptosis in TGF-β1-induced KFs. The mRNA and protein
  expression of Bax and Caspase-3 were detected by RT-qPCR and Western blotting, respectively.
  (a) RT-qPCR and (b) Western blot results. The data are presented as the mean ± SEM.
  ∗∗P < 0.01 compared with the TGF-β1 group. Each assay was performed in triplicate
  and repeated using four independent cell samples (n = 4, 12 samples).
