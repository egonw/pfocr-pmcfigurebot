caption: Exosomal EPHA2 promotes the metastasis of breast cancer cells in vivo. A
  Schematic diagram of the in vivo experiment. B Representative images showed the
  lung metastasis signals detected by IVIS Spectrum imaging systems. C The metastatic
  foci in the lungs of mice were investigated using Computed Tomography (CT) (Left).
  The number of metastatic foci on the lung surface was significantly reduced in the
  EPHA2 knockdown group compared with the control group (Middle). H & E staining showed
  that the number of micro-metastases in lung tissue of mice inoculated with HM breast
  cancer cells was significantly higher than that in the group inoculated with LM
  breast cancer cells (Right). D The IHC analysis showed that the microvessel density
  (MVD) in MDA-231 and MDA-231-shControl tumors was significantly increased compared
  with the T47D and MDA-231-shEPHA2 tumors. Data are shown as mean Â± SD. Statistical
  analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA. ***P < 0.001 and nsP > 0.05 indicate no
  statistical significance.
