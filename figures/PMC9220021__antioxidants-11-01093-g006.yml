caption: Effect of VOdipic-Cl on the gene expression profile of hepatic ER stress
  in obese mice. (A) GO cellular component enrichment bubble chart showing the functional
  enrichment pathways of DEGs in the HFD group vs. HFD+V group. (B) GSEA-KEGG Gene
  set enrichment analysis plot showing the DEGs in the HFD group vs. HFD+V group enriched
  in ER protein synthesis pathway. (C) Heat map showing the expression of the genes
  involved in the ER protein synthesis process. (D) The mRNA levels of ER stress-related
  genes were confirmed by qPCR. (E, F) The protein levels of ER stress-related proteins
  were detected by Western blot. Data are presented as mean Â± SD (n = 3). * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
