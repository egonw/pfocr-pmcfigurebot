caption: 'The activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. The priming signal (signal 1) is provided
  by microbial components or endogenous cytokines, leading to the activation of the
  transcription factor NF-κB and subsequent upregulation of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β. The
  activating signal (signal 2) is from RNA virus, pore-forming toxins, or particulate
  matter activates the NLRP3 inflammasome with the help of ROS as a by-product of
  oxidative phosphorylation from mitochondria. (RNA: Ribonucleic acid; TLR: Toll-like
  receptor; Sirt1: Silent information regulator 2 homolog 1; ROS: Reactive oxygen
  species; NLRP3: NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3; ASC: a protein;
  IL: Interleukin; NF-κB: Nuclear factor kappa B)'
