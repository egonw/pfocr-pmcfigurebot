caption: 'H2-gamendazole (H2-GMZ) blocks heat shock protein (Hsp)90 function in primary
  human autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) cells. A: ADPKD cells
  were stained with anti-Hsp90 antibody (green) to show the presence of Hsp90 in the
  cytoplasm and nucleus. Cells were counterstained with the nuclear stain DAPI (blue).
  The control well was incubated with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody alone. B:
  Hsp90 and client protein ErbB2 remain associated in ADPKD cells. ErbB2 was immunoprecipitated
  from ADPKD cell lysates, and the association with Hsp90 was determined by Western
  blot analysis. C and D: H2-GMZ treatment decreased Hsp90 client protein levels.
  ADPKD cells were treated for 24, 48, or 72 h with 50 Î¼M H2-GMZ and analyzed by Western
  blot analysis. GAPDH and actin served as internal controls. E: H2-GMZ targets Hsp90
  client proteins for degradation via the proteasome pathway. ADPKD cells treated
  with H2-GMZ for 24 h in the presence or absence of MG132, a proteasome inhibitor,
  were lysed in buffer containing Triton X-100, and the insoluble material was pelleted
  and analyzed by Western blot analysis. 17-Allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG)
  was used as a positive control for inhibition of the proteasomal pathway. F: H2-GMZ
  treatment decreased cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) levels.
  All results are representative of three independent experiments with cells from
  three different ADPKD kidneys. Cdk4, cyclin-dependent kinase 4; IP, immunoprecipitation.'
