caption: Overview of the salt stress signalling pathway in plants and effects of host
  salt stress on Dothideomycete-induced disease severity.  highlights two pathways
  that are involved in the salt response leading to sodium (Na+) homeostasis (left)
  and the effect of salt stress on Dothideomycete-induced disease severity (right).
  In A. thaliana, the malectin receptor-like kinase FERONIA (FER)-pathway involves
  specific binding of rapid alkalisation factors (RALFs), which leads to FER phosphorylation
  and inhibition of plasma membrane H+-ATPase 2 (AHA2) and results in cell wall alkalisation.
  Salt stress-associated cell wall damage is sensed by the FER signalling pathway
  (purple) and is proposed to trigger transient cytosolic calcium ion (Ca2+) accumulation.
  In the absence of salt stress, leucine-rich-repeat extensins (LRXs) interact with
  RALFs and prevent the interaction with FER. The salt overly sensitive (SOS) pathway
  (green), which comprises a Ca2+-binding protein SOS3, leads to the export of Na+
  from root epidermal cells to the soil via the Na+/H+ antiporter SOS1. SOS3 activates
  SOS2, a protein in the sucrose nonfermenting 1 (SNF1) related protein kinase 3 (SnRK3)
  family. At the plasma membrane, the SOS3-SOS2 complex phosphorylates SOS1 resulting
  in increased Na+ efflux. The Ca2+ permeable transporter AtANN4 in A. thaliana may
  form a negative feedback loop to fine tune the influx of Ca2+ in response to salt
  stress.
