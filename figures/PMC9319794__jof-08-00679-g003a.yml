caption: The RNA sequence of the spore−like propagule and the hypha. (A) The amount
  of all up−regulated and down−regulated genes between the spore-like propagule and
  the hypha. (B) The heat map of the 20 highest up−regulated genes and the 20 lowest
  down−regulated genes between the spore−like propagule and the hypha. |log2(N/G)|
  > 1, p < 0.05. (C) The enhanced volcano of 13,590 genes expression between the eight
  spore-like propagules and the hyphae. |log2(N/G)| > 1, p < 0.05. (D) Pie chart of
  the most significantly enriched categories within the up−regulated genes between
  the spore−like propagule and the hypha. The method was GO and the referenced species
  was Aspergillus niger CBS513.88 (AspGD). (E) Pie chart of the most significantly
  enriched categories within the down−regulated genes between the spore−like propagule
  and the hypha. The method was GO and the referenced species was Aspergillus niger
  CBS513.88 (AspGD). (F) The enriched patways of differentially expressed genes between
  the spore−like propagule and the hypha. |log2(N/G)| > 1, p < 0.05. (G) The enhanced
  volcano of 416 MAPK signaling pathway genes expression between the spore−like propagule
  and the hypha. |log2(N/G)| > 1, p < 0.05. (H) The enhanced volcano of 42 conidia-associated
  genes (CAGs) expression between the spore-like propagule and the hypha. |log2(N/G)|
  > 1, p < 0.05. (I) The enhanced volcano of 44 germination-associated genes (GeAGs)
  expression between the spore-like propagule and the hypha. |log2(N/G)| > 1, p <
  0.05. (J) The enhanced volcano of 37 genes involved in the production of enzymes
  involved in cell wall sythesis or processing expression between the spore−like propagule
  and the hypha. |log2(N/G)| > 1, p < 0.05.
