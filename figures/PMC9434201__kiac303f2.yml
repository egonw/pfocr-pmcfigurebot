caption: 'Possible effects of environmental perturbations on CAM. A, Effects of elevated
  CO2 concentrations on the four phases of CAM (based on data summarized in ). Filled
  and unfilled boxes at the bottom represent night and day, respectively. Dashed line
  showed standard net CO2 uptake curve at ambient CO2 levels, whereas purple and orange
  lines indicate two possible CAM responses: increase in phase I CO2 uptake (purple)
  or increase in phases II and IV uptake (orange). B, Schematic showing possible effects
  of increasing night temperatures on enzymes, malate efflux from the vacuole, and
  alterations to the carbon cycle in CAM plants. C, Changes to energy demands and
  dissipation under well-watered and drought-stress conditions for a CAM plant, where
  CO2 can be supplied either by phase I or phases II and IV. Arrow thickness indicates
  the amount of flow through that part of the pathway. Drought stress can reduce CO2
  uptake and result in an imbalance of energy entering the system versus energy required;
  excess energy can be dissipated via NPQ and xanthophyll. ATP, adenosine triphosphate;
  NADP, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate.'
