caption: 'Bcl‐3 activates Wnt/β‐catenin signalling pathway and maintains β‐catenin
  functions in vitro. (A,B) Gene ontology (GO, Left) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes
  and genomes (KEGG, Right) analysis of downregulated genes with Bcl‐3 deletion in
  bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). (C) Heat map showed relative genes expression
  in Wnt pathway of shCtrl and shBcl‐3 BMSCs. (D) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
  showed a significant decrease of Wnt/β‐catenin gene signatures in shBcl‐3 BMSCs.
  (E) Lysates from BMSCs were used, and anti‐Bcl‐3 antibody was used in IP followed
  by immunoblot using the indicated antibodies. (F) Bcl‐3, Ac‐K49‐β‐catenin and β‐catenin
  were analysed by immunoblot in control and Bcl‐3‐knockdown BMSCs after treated with
  Wnt 3a for 0 h or 4 h. (G) The levels of Bcl‐3 in nuclear and cytoplasmic. (H) Bcl‐3,
  Ac‐K49‐β‐catenin and β‐catenin were analysed by immunoblot in control and Bcl‐3‐knockdown
  BMSCs after treated with cycloheximide (CHX, 50 mg/ml). (I) BMSCs were cotransfected
  with the indicated siRNA and TOP/FOP Flash reporter plasmid. (J) ChIP assays on
  the promoter regions of the Runx2 and Osterix genes were performed in control and
  Bcl‐3‐silenced BMSCs. The data are presented as the mean ± SD. **P < .01; ****P
  < .0001 vs. control group. Statistical analysis was performed using two‐way ANOVA.
