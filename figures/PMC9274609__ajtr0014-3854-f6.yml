caption: 'NBDP decreased the enhanced p65 DNA binding activity induced by LPS inhalation.
  DNA binding activity of NF-κB p65 was examined by a TransAM p65 transcription factor
  ELISA kit. Each bar represents the mean ± SD of 6 mice. *P<0.05 compared with Control.
  #P<0.05 compared with Model. &P<0.05 compared with N-NBD. %P<0.05 compared with
  L-NBD. $P<0.05 compared with M-NBD.'
article_title: Binding domain peptide ameliorates alveolar hypercoagulation and fibrinolytic
  inhibition in mice with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome
  Via NF-κB signaling pathway.
