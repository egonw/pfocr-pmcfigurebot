caption: 'Expression of the JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway of lung tissue in each group.
  (a) JAK1 protein expression of lung tissue detected by immunohistochemistry is presented
  by photomicrographs. The nucleus is colored in blue and the positive cells are colored
  in brown (scale bar is 50 µm, ×400). (b) The strip chart of JAK1 and STAT3, β-actin
  was used as the internal reference. (c) The relative JAK1 gene expression. (d) Semiquantitative
  analysis based on the intensity of strip chart for JAK1 in lung tissue. (e) STAT3
  protein expression of lung tissue detected by immunohistochemistry was presented
  by photomicrographs. The nucleus is colored in blue and the positive cells are colored
  in brown (scale bar is 50 µm, ×400). (f) Semiquantitative analysis of STAT3 expression.
  (g) Gene expression of STAT3. Error bars represent SD, n = 3. ∗, #, &, and Δ represent
  P values <0.05 which are considered statistically significant. ∗ versus MC (model
  control), # versus herbs low, & versus herbs mid, and Δ versus herbs high.'
