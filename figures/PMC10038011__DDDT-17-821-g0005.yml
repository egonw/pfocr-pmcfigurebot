caption: 'MDA-MB-468 and Hs 578T lines in culture were treated with 12.5, 25, 50μM
  ICA or 0.1% DMSO for 24 h. (A and B) Representative fluorescent images taken by
  microscope for DCFH-DA staining in Hs 578T and MDA-MB-468 cells and quantified for
  the relative fluorescence intensity and plotted; n =3. (Bar: 100 μm). (C and D)
  The population of apoptotic (early + late apoptosis) cells were measured by Muse
  cell analyzer; n = 3. Mean ± S.D. Data are representative of 3 independent determinations.
  **p < 0.01, compared with the control group; ##p < 0.01, compared with the experimental
  group.'
