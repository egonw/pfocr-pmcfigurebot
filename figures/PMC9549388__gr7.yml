caption: The PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone reduces hyperinflammation in macrophages
  stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 or TLR7/8 agonist(A) GSEA analysis of long-chain fatty
  acid transport and lipid metabolic process gene sets in macrophages from severe
  versus mild COVID-19 patients.(B) Human primary monocyte-derived macrophages were
  stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 virus (MOI = 0.1) for 24 h. mRNA levels of CD36, FABP4,
  and ACAA2 were detected by real-time PCR.(C) GSEA analysis of PPAR signaling pathway
  in macrophages from severe versus mild COVID-19 patients.(D) Pearson correlation
  plot of metabolic scores versus PPAR pathway score in macrophages from BALF of HCs
  and patients with COVID-19.(E) Expression levels of PPARG in macrophages from BALF
  of patients with HC, mild or COVID-19.(F) Human primary monocyte-derived macrophages
  were stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 virus (MOI = 0.1) for 24 h. mRNA level of PPARG
  were detected by real-time PCR. Shown (B&F) are representative data (mock, n = 5;
  SARS-CoV-2, n = 5) from 3 independent donors with mean values.(G and H) Human primary
  macrophages were cultured in the presence of PPARγ inhibitor GW9662 (2μM). At 48
  h, the cells were stimulated with R848. IL-6, TNF-α, and CCL2 levels in culture
  supernatant 24 h after stimulation. Shown are representative data (mock, n = 6;
  R848, n = 6, Rosi + R848, n = 6) from 3 independent donors with mean values.(I)
  Human primary macrophages were cultured in the presence of PPARγ activator rosiglitazone.
  At 48 h, the cells were incubated in medium containing 0.2μM BODIPY FL C16 for 20 min
  or in medium containing 0.1mg/mL pHrodo Green E. coli BioParticles Conjugate for
  2 h at 37°C.(J–L) Uptake of fatty acids (J-K) and E. coli bioparticles (L) were
  compared between groups using flow cytometry. Shown are representative data from
  2 independent donors with mean values.(M and N) Human primary macrophages were cultured
  in the presence of PPARγ activator rosiglitazone (5μM). At 48 h, the cells were
  stimulated with R848. IL-6, TNF-α, and CCL2 levels in culture supernatant 24 h after
  stimulation (N). Shown are representative data (mock, n = 6; R848, n = 6, Rosi +
  R848, n = 6) from 3 independent donors with mean values.(O) Human primary macrophages
  were cultured as in K, CD36 and FABP4 mRNA levels in cells were detected by real-time
  PCR 24 h after stimulation.(P–R) Human primary monocytes were differentiated to
  macrophages with M-CSF (colony stimulating factor 1) for 4 days in the presence
  of rosiglitazone. The differentiated cells were then stimulated with SARS-CoV-2
  (MOI = 0.1) for 24 h (P). IL-6 and TNF-α levels in culture supernatant were detected
  by ELISA (Q). mRNA levels of CD36 and FABP4 in cells were detected by real-time
  PCR 24 h after stimulation (R). Shown are representative data (mock, n = 5; Rosi,
  n = 5, SARS-CoV-2, n = 5, Rosi + SARS-CoV-2, n = 5) from 3 independent donors with
  mean values. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001. Unpaired, two-tailed Student’s
  ttest (for B, F, and L) or one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s post hoc test (for H,
  K, N, O, Q, and R) were performed to compare between groups.
