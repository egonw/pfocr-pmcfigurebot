caption: Hypothetical mechanism of the protective effect of JCo extract against LPS.
  LPS exposure leads to NFκB‐mediated inflammatory response, which increases TNF‐α
  and IL‐1β expression. JCo extract may reduce inflammatory mediators and oxidative
  stress through the activation of the AMPK pathway
article_title: Juniperus communis extract ameliorates lipopolysaccharide‐induced acute
  kidney injury through the adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase pathway.
