caption: 'Abundances of KEGG pathway modules were found to be significant using Kruskal–Wallis
  multivariate analysis related to bile acid synthesis. (A) Relative abundance of
  the choloylglycine hydrolase gene in the sHF, mHF, and Sham samples (Kruskal–Wallis
  test p-value = 0.0037). (n values are as follows: Sham = 9, mHF = 7, sHF = 6). (B)
  Relative abundance of the choloylglycine hydrolase gene in the Sham and TAC samples
  at different time points showing an increase in the concentration of the gene with
  time in TAC samples as compared to Sham samples (Kruskal–Wallis test p-value = 0.23
  for Sham samples and p-value = 0.01 for TAC samples). (n values are as follows:
  Sham day 0 = 10, day 7 = 10, day 14 = 9, day 42 = 9; TAC day 0 = 16, day 7 = 16,
  day 14 = 16, day 42 = 15). (C) Relative abundance of 7-α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
  gene in the sHF, mHF, and Sham samples with a significant decrease in sHF and mHF
  compared to the Sham samples (Kruskal–Wallis test p-value = 0.042). (n values are
  as follows: Sham = 9, mHF = 7, sHF = 6). (D) Relative abundance of 7-α-hydroxysteroid
  dehydrogenase gene in the Sham and TAC samples at different time points with a significant
  decrease in abundance with time in the TAC samples (Kruskal–Wallis test p-value
  = 0.0025). (n values are as follows: Sham day 0 = 10, day 7 = 10, day 14 = 9, day
  42 = 9; TAC day 0 = 16, day 7 = 16, day 14 = 16, day 42 = 15). *, **, and *** correspond
  to p ≤ 0.05, p ≤ 0.01, and p ≤ 0.001, respectively; ns, non-significant.'
