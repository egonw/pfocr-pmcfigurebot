caption: 'Generation and characterisation of NVs generated from human-induced pluripotent
  stem cells. (A) iPSC nanovesicle generation using serial extrusion (10, 5, 1 µm
  filter, 13× each membrane) with the cell suspension purified using density-cushion
  ultracentrifugation to obtain fractions (F) 1–7 of increasing density. (B) The buoyant
  densities of seven fractions collected for each iPSC preparation were determined
  by absorbance at 244 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 320 L g−1cm−1. Protein
  yield determined based on micro-BCA protein quantification (as a % of total), revealing
  major fraction F5 as NV-containing. Data presented as mean ± s.e.m. (C) Cryo-electron
  microscopic analysis of CL2- and CERA-derived NVs (F5), scale 100 nm. (D) Scatter
  plot distribution of NV particle diameter as determined by cryo-EM images. Data
  presented as mean ± s.e.m (standard error of mean). (E) Size distribution profiles
  of NVs determined by single particle tracking analysis (ZetaView), indicating mean
  ~110 nm. (F) Protein yields (determined by microBCA) of NVs (F5, density-based preparation)
  and natural EVs (EVs, density-based preparation) from CL2 and CERA iPSCs. Yields
  correspond to the same starting cell number for each cell model. (G) Workflow for
  mass spectrometry-based proteomic profiling of NVs. (H) Protein identification and
  LFQ (normalised) intensity for NVs and cell lysates from each iPSC model (n = 4).
  (I) Pearson correlation (R-score) of NVs and iPSCs (n = 4). (J) Abundance distribution
  (waterfall plots, LFQ intensity, log10) of proteins identified in iPSCs (cells)
  and derived NVs. Several examples of proteins similarly identified between both
  cells and NVs are shown. (K) Selected proteins identified in NVs associated with
  wound healing, hypoxia response, extracellular matrix organisation and implicated
  in tissue repair found in natural EVs. (L) Hierarchical cluster analysis of iPSCs
  and NVs (p < 0.05, fold change (FC): 1.5), reveals three clusters of differential
  protein expression; high abundant NVs, low abundant NVs, similarly expressed (common)
  between NVs and iPSCs. (M) Gene Ontology enrichment analysis (ranked, p < 0.05)
  of each cluster based on cellular component, biological processes, and Reactome
  pathway analyses.'
