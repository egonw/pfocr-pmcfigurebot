caption: 'Swr1/Ino80 pathway is required for RPA relocalization to nuclear periphery
  in mcm4-dg. a) Nuclei of indicated strains imaged for RPA-CFP and ccr1N-mCherry
  after 4 h at 36°C (FY9691, FY9690, FY9725, FY9689, FY9688, FY9693). Scale bar 2 µm.
  b) Percent of cells containing multifoci RPA from images as in (a). c) Individual
  RPA puncta size measured using ImageJ from images as in (a). d) Distribution of
  megafoci RPA over 4 h at 36°C in different zones as defined in . Five replicates
  shown. e) Chromatin-bound fractions from WT, mcm4-dg, mcm4-ts lysates were immunoprecipitated
  against RPA and probed for Cds1-myc (FY10125, FY10126, FY10127). Bottom: band intensity
  quantified using ImageJ and normalized to PCNA. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.'
