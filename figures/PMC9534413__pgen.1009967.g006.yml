figure_title: Genetic dissection of the DDX6 functions indicates that the DDX6-miRNA
  pathway is essential during early embryogenesis
caption: '(A) PCA plot of the ESC and EpiLC Day2 samples of each genotype group. (B)
  Summary of the GSEA results of ESC RNA-seq data. The gene sets that were changed
  in Ddx6 KO, Dgcr8 KO, Eif4enif1 KO, and Dcp2 KO were compared. (C) Dgcr8 KO embryos
  exhibited similar morphological defects to Ddx6 KO embryos at E7.5, but they became
  more malformed at E8.5 (Scale: 100 μm for E7.5; 200 μm for E8.5). (D) Whole-mount
  ISH of E7.5 Dgcr8 KO embryos with Nodal, Eomes, and Brachyury probes (Scale: 100
  μm, n = 3 for Nodal, n = 4 for Eomes, n = 5 for Brachyury). (E) Comparison of gene
  expression between Ddx6 KO and Dgcr8 KO. qRT-PCR analysis of several key genes during
  the EpiLC induction period. Each bar represents the relative expression of KO cells
  to WT cells at the indicated time point. Mean ± SEM. Student’s t-test (n ≥ 3) (*p
  ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤ 0.001, ****p ≤ 0.0001). (F) GSEA enrichment plot of the
  “negative regulation of BMP signaling pathway” gene set in four mutant ESCs. Black
  bars represent the position of the genes that belong to this gene set (n = 45) in
  the whole ranked gene list. The green line shows the overall distribution of this
  gene set (whether over-represented at the top (left) or bottom (right) of the ranked
  list of genes).'
