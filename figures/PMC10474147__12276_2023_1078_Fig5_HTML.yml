figure_title: Comparison of mitoptosis and mitophagy
caption: This figure illustrates the crucial processes of mitoptosis and mitophagy
  that maintain mitochondrial quality and prevent cell pathology. A Mitoptosis is
  characterized by several events, including mitochondrial fission, the clustering
  of spherical mitochondria in the perinuclear area, enwrapping of these clusters
  by a membrane to form a “mitoptotic body,” decomposition of mitochondria into small
  vesicles, protrusion of the body from the cell, and disruption of the boundary membrane.
  This process is driven by mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) production. B Mitophagy is a selective autophagic mechanism for the degradation
  of damaged or unnecessary mitochondria. This procedure requires activation of general
  autophagy and priming of injured mitochondria via the Pink1/Parkin signaling pathway.
  Autophagosomes engulf targeted mitochondria, which are then digested and degraded
  in lysosomes.
