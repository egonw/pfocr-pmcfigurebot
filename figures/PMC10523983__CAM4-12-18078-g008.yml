caption: UBE2S promotes HCC growth and metastasis by inactivating not only VHL/HIF‐1α
  signaling but also the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. (A, B) The expression of VHL and HIF‐1α
  in HCC cells after upregulation and downregulation of UBE2S was determined by western
  blotting and immunofluorescence. (C) Representative images of VHL and HIF‐1α protein
  tested by IHC in liver tissues from a subcutaneous xenograft model. Quantitation
  of the IOD is shown in the right panel. (D) A coimmunoprecipitation assay was performed
  to analyse the direct binding between UBE2S and VHL in HCC cells in the presence
  of 10 mM MG132. (E) The levels of VHL in BEL‐7402 cells after transfection with
  UBE2S plasmid in the presence or absence of MG132. (F) The expression of STAT3,
  p‐STAT3, JAK2, and p‐JAK2 was determined by western blotting after upregulation
  and downregulation of UBE2S in HCC cells. (G) Representative images of p‐STAT3 and
  p‐JAK2 protein tested by IHC from a subcutaneous xenograft model. Quantitation of
  the IOD is shown in the right panel. The data are presented as the mean ± SD. *p < 0.05;
  **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.
