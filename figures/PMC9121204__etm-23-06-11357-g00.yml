caption: During ischemia, cardiomyocytes undergo anaerobic metabolism, which results
  in decreased ATP levels and pH, which increase levels of intracellular Na+ and Ca2+.
  Reperfusion leads to further increases in intracellular Ca2+ and ROS, which cause
  MIRI. The primary apoptosis signaling pathways are the intrinsic (mitochondrial)
  and extrinsic (death receptor) pathway. The intrinsic pathway is induced by release
  of CytC, which is regulated by Bcl-2 family proteins. The extrinsic pathway is triggered
  by death receptors (such as TNFR) that activate caspase-8. Programmed necroptosis
  is mediated by the complex RIP1-RIP3 and MLKL when caspase-8 is inhibited, but the
  downstream pathway of MLKL remains unclear. Necroptosis and apoptosis have certain
  commonalities. For instance, caspase-8 decreases MIRI via inhibiting necroptosis
  by binding to an anti-apoptotic protein (cFLIP). Three forms of autophagy are macroautophagy,
  microautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy. Macroautophagy is the primary pathway,
  which is promoted by PI3K, AMPK and Beclin1, while AKT/mTOR pathways inhibit this
  type of autophagy. Beclin1 is abundant in the ER. However, it remains uncertain
  whether ERS regulates expression of Beclin1 during ischemia or reperfusion. During
  ischemia and early reperfusion, cellular acidosis, internal environmental instability
  and other factors promote the release of ferrivalent or ferrous ions from enzymes,
  thereby activating the Fenton reaction, resulting in increased ROS, which leads
  to ferroptosis of cardiomyocytes. ROS, reactive oxygen species; MIRI, myocardial
