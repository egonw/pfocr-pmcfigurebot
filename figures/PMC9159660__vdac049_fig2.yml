caption: 'Synthetic extracellular matrix (sECM) co-cultures enable long-term cultivation
  of primary patient-derived pediatric glioma cells and testing of therapeutics. (A)
  Schematic representation of long-term culture experiments with sECM co-cultures.
  (B) Representative immunofluorescence microscopy images of long-term sECM co-cultures
  of cells derived from 3 distinct primary pediatric brain tumors. BT1887 was non-proliferative
  in short-term cultures but maintained GFAP positivity and viability (measured by
  Zombie red viability dye staining, not shown) over long-term culture. (C) Schematic
  representation of short-term drug treatment culture experiments with sECM juvenile
  pilocytic astrocytoma (JPA) co-cultures. JPA cells were embedded into sECM on day
  0, treated with DAY101 (1 µM) or DMSO (control) for 7 days, then proliferation and
  MAPK pathway activation were assessed by immunofluorescent staining. (D) Representative
  immunofluorescence microscopy images of sECM JPA co-cultures (BT1860 tumor). Scale
  bars = 10 µm. (E) Quantification of EdU incorporation in 7-day sECM co-cultures
  treated with DAY101. Each point represents an individual biological replicate (average
  of single slide) and point shapes denote replicates from the same tumor. All tumors
  had a sample size of n = 3 in each treatment condition except BT1850, which had
  n = 2 in the DAY101 condition. Mean and SEM are shown for overall data. Statistical
  comparison was performed using an unpaired t test with Welch’s correction. Abbreviations:
  DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; SEM, standard error of the mean.'
