caption: Measurement of the effect of the honokiol microemulsion on oxidative stress
  in zebrafish embryos. The content of oxidation products is shown in (A). The antioxidant
  activity is shown in (B). The mRNA expression of oxidative genes is shown in (C).
  The data are expressed as the mean Â± SD (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 compared with the
  control group).
