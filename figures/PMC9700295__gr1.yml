caption: 'Effects of taraxasterol on oxidative stress by regulating Nrf2/Keap1 signaling
  pathway in AFB1-induced chicken hepatocytes. The levels of SOD, GSH, MDA and ROS
  (A) and the mRNA (B) and protein (C) expression of HO-1, NQO1, Nrf2 and Keap1 were
  determined. Data represent the means ± SD for n = 5. ##P < 0.01 vs. normal group;
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 vs. AFB1 group.'
