figure_title: Overview of homologous recombination
caption: Schematic of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and their repair by homologous
  recombination. CtIP and MRN bind to the 3â€²-overhang single-stranded DNA as initiators
  to regulate nucleases EXO1 and BLM/DNA2, which carry out further resection of DNA
  and recruit RPA. The recombinase RAD51 replaces phosphorylated RPA and interacts
  with BARD1, PALB2 and BRCA2, initiating the SDSA pathway or DSBR pathway to repair
  DNA. DSB, double strand break; CtIP, human C-terminal binding protein; MRN, constituted
  by MRE11, RAD50 and NBS1; EXO1, Exonuclease 1; BLM, Bloom; DNA2, DNA replication
  ATP-dependent helicase/nuclease 2; RPA, Replication Protein A; BARD1, BRCA1-associated
  RING domain 1; PALB2, Partner and Localizer of BRCA2; BRCA2, breast cancer 2; SDSA,
  synthesis-dependent strand annealing; DSBR, double-strand break repair.
