caption: 'Spearman correlation analysis. (A) Correlations analysis between HF-related
  indices, TJPs and 19 shared genera. (B) Correlations analysis between HF-related
  indices, TJPs and 61 co-differential metabolites. (C) Correlations analysis between
  10 shared genera and 36 key metabolites. The metabolic pathway or classification
  was presented on the right: the blue notes are KEGG metabolic pathways; the yellow
  notes are the LIPID MAPS classification; the black notes are HMDB classification.
  Yellow asterisk: (1) â‰¥8 indices were intimately correlated with certain genus or
  metabolite; (2) reversed by QJ treatment. *, p <0.05; **, p <0.01.'
