caption: 'Metabolic activity of THLE-3, HepG2, C3A and SNU-449 cells after incubation
  for 24 h (Aa–Ad) and 48 h (Ba–Bd) in medium supplemented with 10 or 20 ng/mL growth
  factors (measured by the XTT assay). The growth factor concentration was not significant.
  There were significant differences in metabolic activity by control and growth factors-treated
  THLE-3 cells ((Aa), p < 0.001; (Ba), p < 0.001), HepG2 cells ((Bb), p < 0.001),
  C3A cells ((Ac), p < 0.001; (Bc), p < 0.001), and SNU-449 cells ((Ad), p < 0.001).
  Differences with a p-value ≤ 0.05 were defined as statistically significant compared
  to the control group: one asterisk (*), p-value ≤ 0.05; two asterisks (**), p-value ≤  0.01;
  three asterisks (***), p-value ≤  0.001.'
