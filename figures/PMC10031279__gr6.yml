caption: USP13 interacts with Irhom2, and USP13 removes Irhom2 K63-linked ubiquitination
  mediated by ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc13. (A) Representative immunoblotting
  bands for GST precipitation displaying USP13–Irhom2 binding by incubating purified
  USP13-flag with purified Irhom2-GST or by incubating Irhom2-flag with purified USP13-GST
  in vitro. Purified GST was regarded as a control. (B) Schematic of human full-length
  and truncated USP13 and Irhom2 (left), and representative immunoblotting mapping
  analyses indicating the interaction domains of USP13 and Irhom2 (right). (C) Representative
  immunoprecipitation analysis showing the ubiquitination levels of Irhom2 in the
  Flox mice and HepUsp13KO mice livers in the presence or absence of HFHC treatment
  of 24 weeks (n = 4 mice per group). (D) Ubiquitination levels of Irhom2 in 0.5 mmol/L
  PA-treated primary hepatocytes for 4 h. (E, F) Ubiquitination levels of Irhom2 after
  HA-USP13 overexpression and in response to 0.5  mM PA administration in WT L02 cells
  co-transfected with Flag-Irhom2 and the indicated Myc-tagged ubiquitin constructs
  (K48O, K63O, K33O, K6O, K29O, K27O, K11O). The tail label “O” means ubiquitin in
  which all lysines except itself were mutated. The empty vector was used as control.
  (G, H) Representative immunoprecipitation and Western blotting assays of the indicated
  proteins in the WT L02 cells transfected with HA-USP13, Flag-Irhom2 or Myc-Ub vectors
  in response to PA administration. (I) K63-linked ubiquitin (K63-Ub) and corresponding
  Irhom2 expression in primary hepatocytes transfected with AdshRNA or AdshUsp13 in
  the presence or absence of PA. (J) Representative immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting
  assays of the indicated proteins in the Usp13-deletion (Usp13 KO) L02 cells transfected
  with HA-USP13, HA-USP13 (M664E/M739E), Flag-Irhom2 and Myc-Ub vectors in response
  to PA administration. (K) Representative immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting
  bands showing the possible interactions between Myc-Ubc13, HA-USP13, HA-USP13 (M664E/M739E)
  and Flag-Irhom2. (L) Representative immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting bands
  showing the indicated protein in the Usp13 KO-L02 cells transfected with HA-USP13,
  HA-USP13 (M664E/M739E), Flag-Irhom2 and Myc-Ubc13 vectors in response to PA treatment.
  (M) Representative immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting bands displaying the ubiquitination
  levels of Irhom2 and indicated protein expression in lysates of WT L02 cells and
  Ubc13-deletion (Ubc13 KO) L02 cells transfected with HA-USP13, HA-USP13 (M664E/M739E),
  Flag-Irhom2 and Myc-Ub vectors in response to PA challenge.
