caption: TGFBI functions via binding to integrin αvβ5 on GSCs. (A) Schematic diagram
  of TGFBI protein structure. It contained a secretory signal (SP) in the N-terminal
  cysteine-rich domain (CRD), followed by four fasciclin-1 domains (FAS1 1-4) and
  Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) in the C-terminal. The RGD motif could bind the integrins. (B)
  GSEA of the TGFBI high expression versus low expression in TCGA GBM RNA-seq indicated
  the integrin-binding pathway was significantly upregulated in the TGFBI high expression
  group. (C) qRT-PCR analyses of the expression of the αv, α3, α5, α6, β1, β3, and
  β5 in GSCs (456 and 3691) cultured with rhTGFBI or control. N = 3, ***P < 0.001,
  ****P < 0.0001, ANOVA, analysis of variance. (D) IB analysis of ITGAV in GSCs (456
  and 3691) cultured with rhTGFBI or control. (E) Representative immunofluorescence
  (IF) staining of TGFBI and the potential receptors (ITGAV and ITGB5) in human GBM
  were shown. Scale bar represents 20 µm. (F) Representative IF images of ITGAV and
  TGFBI in mouse models. Scale bar represents 200 µm. (G) Co-immunoprecipitation of
  ITGAV and ITGB5 with the TGFBI-specific antibody from 456 and 3691 GSC cell lysates.
  Immunoglobulin G (IgG) was used as a control antibody for IP.
