caption: Correlation of the galactose metabolic pathway with stemness in breast cancer
  cell lines. (A) Representative flow cytometry plots of Hs578t, MDA-MB-231, HCC1937,
  and BT549 cells using the cancer stem cell (CSC) markers CD29 and CDC4. (B,C) Representative
  images (left) and mammosphere formation counting (right) of mammospheres formed
  from MDA-MB-231 (B) and Hs578t (C) cells treated with vehicle and D-galactose. Scale
  bars, 100 Âµm. (D,E) qRT-PCR analysis of GALK1, UGP2, G6PC3, ITGA6, ITGB1, and CD44
  expression in MDA-MB-231 (D) and Hs578t (E) cells treated with vehicle and D-galactose.
