caption: Vagal protection loss leads to pronounced inflammatory macrophage upregulation
  in cardiac injury. (A-B) Volcano and Venn diagrams depicting the differentially
  expressed genes in the AR vs Sham group and VAG vs AR group. (C) Heatmap showing
  the expression of 61 genes obtained from the intersection of image B. (D-E) GO and
  KEGG enrichment analysis performed on these 61 genes. (F) tSNE-based clustering
  of 3 sham and 2 infarction samples using single-cell transcriptome sequencing data
  (GSE153481) from a public database. (G-H) Categorical annotation of different cell
  types. (I) Changes in the expression ratio of cells in each group. (J) Expression
  of 61 differential genes annotated to 5 closely related genes of the IL-17 signaling
  pathway, differentially expressed in the AR vs Sham group and VAG vs AR group. (K)
  ssGSEA analysis revealed changes in the proportion of various cell types in the
  VAG vs AR group, and the results indicate that macrophage changes were predominantly
  up-regulated among inflammatory cells.
