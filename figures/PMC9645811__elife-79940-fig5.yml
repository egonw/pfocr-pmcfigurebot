figure_title: Polysome enrichment of transcripts by human bone marrow stromal cell
  (hBMSC-CM) following FLT3 inhibition is highly selective for oxidative phosphorylation
  mRNAs and is mTOR-dependent
caption: '(A) RNA yields from whole-cell lysates (input) and heavy polysome fractions
  () were measured and normalized to vehicle-treated group in RPMI for each biological
  replicate. (B, C) Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) of Hallmark and Gene Ontology
  gene sets was performed on RNA-seq data from input samples. Quizartinib-treated
  cells in hBMSC-CM were compared with combo-treated cells in hBMSC-CM. (B) Top 10
  enriched signaling pathways from GSEA of Hallmark gene sets with significant alterations
  (p-adj<0.1) represented with colors (red: negative normalized enrichment score [NES];
  blue: positive NES). Asterisks denote pathways that exhibited partial restoration
  following quizartinib treatment in hBMSC-CM compared to those in RPMI (). (C) Enrichment
  plots of mTOR signaling, translational elongation, and translational termination
  are shown. (D, E) Top 10 enriched signaling pathways (by p-adj) from GSEA of Hallmark
  gene sets for RNA-seq data from human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells from heavy
  polysome-associated mRNAs normalized to input. Pathways with significant alteration
  (p-adj<0.1) are represented with colors (red: negative NES; blue: positive NES).
  Analyses were done by comparing (D) cells treated with quizartinib in hBMSC-CM with
  those in RPMI or (E) cells treated with combo in hBMSC-CM with those treated with
  quizartinib alone in hBMSC-CM. Enrichment plots of oxidative phosphorylation pathway
  for each comparison are shown on the right.'
