caption: Effect of tissue culture format on EGFR pathway signaling in drug-resistant
  melanoma models. (A) A375 WT, NRAS Q61K, KRAS G13D, and MEK1 Q56P cells growing
  in a 2D monolayer (top) and as 3D spheroids (bottom). For spheroid formation, 500
  cells from each line were seeded in each well of a 96-well ultra-low attachment
  spheroid microplate and grown for five days before imaging; (B) Immunoblots tracking
  EGFR pathway signaling in engineered A375 melanoma model cells in 2D and 3D tissue
  culture. Protein was harvested from each cell line growing in 2D culture, and cellular
  protein from 3D spheroids was collected from spheroids seeded at 500 cells per 96-well
  and grown for seven days. Total protein (20 Î¼g) was loaded in each lane and samples
  were blotted for total EGFR, total MEK1/2, phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser217/221), total ERK1/2
  (p44/42 MAPK), phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), AKT, phospho-AKT (Ser473), and GAPDH.
