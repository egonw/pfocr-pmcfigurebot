caption: Ammonia and amino acid metabolism in muscles during exercise. Ammonia synthesis
  increases due to the enhanced turnover of adenine nucleotides. The main pathway
  of ammonia detoxification in muscles is glutamine synthesis. Increased glycolysis
  and CAC activity are essential for an adequate supply of α-KG and subsequent glutamate
  and glutamine synthesis. ASCT1 (alanine, serine, cysteine, and threonine carrier
  1); BCAA, branched-chain amino acids; BCA-CoA, branched-chain acyl-CoA; BCKA, branched-chain
  keto acids; CAC, citric acid cycle; FA, fatty acids; LAT1 (large neutral amino acid
  transporter 1); OA, oxaloacetate; X-ag (transporter for aspartate and glutamate).
