caption: Identification of the downstream signaling pathway of LHX6EX(+12) group in
  cervical cancer cells. (A) Heatmap of RNA‐seq data for the specific 53 genes co‐regulated
  by both Sh‐LHX6EX(+12) group and Sh‐LHX6All group but not observed in LHX6EX(−12)
  isoform group. (B, C) Top 10 GO analyses terms of biological process and KEGG enrichment
  analysis results for 53 overlapped genes above. (D‐F) Western blot analysis to quantify
  the protein expression levels of MEK, p‐MEK, ERK, p‐ERK, JNK, p‐JNK, P38, and p‐P38
  in CasKi and HeLa cells with knockdown LHX6 isoform groups
article_title: The exon 12‐containing LHX6 isoforms promote cervical cancer cell proliferation
  by regulating the MAPK signaling pathway.
