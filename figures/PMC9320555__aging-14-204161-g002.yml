caption: BDDD-72 and curcumin triggered apoptosis against medulloblastoma cells. (A)
  Cell apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry assay using the Annexin V/PI after
  BDDD-721 or curcumin treatment for 24h. (B) Apoptosis-related proteins of cleaved
  PARP, PARP and Bcl-2 were analyzed by western blot. (C) Caspase-3 activity was measured
  by ELISA assay. Compared with Control, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.
article_title: Curcumin analogue BDDD-721 exhibits more potent anticancer effects
  than curcumin on medulloblastoma by targeting Shh/Gli1 signaling pathway.
