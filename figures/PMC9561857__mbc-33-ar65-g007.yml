caption: TAK1 inhibits GSK3β through AKT activation. A–C, HLMVECs treated with either
  vehicle (control) or 1 μM OZ for 1 h and then challenged with thrombin (A) or LPS
  (B) were used for IB analysis. **p < 0.001 compared with controls. C, HLMVECs treated
  with thrombin or LPS were immunoprecipitated with anti-phospho-TAK1 Ab and blotted
  with anti-phospho-AKT Ab or anti-AKT Ab. Results shown are representative of 3 separate
  experiments. (D, E) HLMVECs treated either with vehicle (control) or with 1 μM AKT
  inhibitor for 1 h and then challenged with thrombin (D) or LPS (E) were used for
  IB analysis to determine S-9 phosphorylation of GSK3β. Results shown are representative
  of three separate experiments. **p < 0.001 compared with controls. (F, G) HLMVECs
  were treated with vehicle (control) or 1 μM AKT inhibitor and then challenged with
  thrombin or LPS to induce real-time changes in TER for the purpose of assessing
  endothelial barrier integrity. Arrows indicate the time at which inhibitors, thrombin
  (25 nM), or LPS (1 μg/ml) were added. **p < 0.001, AKT inhibitor vs. control, thrombin
  vs. AKT inhibitor plus thrombin, or LPS vs. AKT inhibitor plus LPS. H, Model of
  EC TAK1-dependent mechanisms of endothelial barrier repair after vascular injury.
  In ECs, TAK1 signaling downstream of PAR-1 or TLR4 triggers AKT activation. The
  activated AKT phosphorylates GSK3β on S9 to inactivate GSK3β, which in turn prevents
  β-cat degradation via the proteasomal pathway and thereby stabilizes AJs.
