caption: 'Effects of overexpressed Smad3 on the protein expressions related to apoptosis
  and PKA/Nox4 signaling pathway in MN model cells. AB8/13 cells were treated with
  Ang II (100 nmol/L) to induce MN cell model, followed by the transfection of siNC
  or siMSTN and NC or Smad3 overexpression plasmid. (a–d) Expressions of apoptosis-related
  proteins in the model + siNC + NC, model + siMSTN + NC, model + siNC + Smad3, and
  model + siMSTN + Smad3 groups were determined by western blot, with GAPDH serving
  as the internal reference. (e–g) After the transfection, the PKA/Nox4 signaling
  pathway-related protein expressions were detected by western blot, with GAPDH acting
  as the internal reference. All experiments were repeated three times to obtain average
  values. The data are displayed as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments;
  &p < 0.05, &&p < 0.01, &&&p < 0.001 vs Model + siNC + NC; +p < 0.05; ++p < 0.01;
  +++p < 0.001 vs Model + siMSTN + NC; ^p < 0.05, ^^p < 0.01, ^^^p < 0.001 vs Model
  + siNC + Smad3. Abbreviation: MN, membranous nephropathy; MSTN, myostatin; p-PKA,
  phosphorylated-protein kinase A; Nox4, NADPH oxidase 4; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; siMSTN, small interfering RNA targeting MSTN; siNC, siRNA negative
  control.'
