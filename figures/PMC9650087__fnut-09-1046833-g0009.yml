caption: Signal transduction pathways enriched by the significantly different genera
  in high salt (HS) induced mice which were screened by fecal microbiota transplantation
  (n = 6). The relative abundance of Two-component system, HIF-1 signaling pathway,
  AMPK signaling pathway, Phosphatidylinositol signaling system, PI3K-Akt signaling
  pathway, MAPK signaling pathway-plant, FoxO signaling pathway, Phospholipase D signaling
  pathway, MAPK signaling pathway-fly, MAPK signaling pathway-yeast and cAMP signaling
  pathway (Aâ€“K). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001; ns, no significance.
