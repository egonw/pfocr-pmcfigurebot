caption: The redox-sensitive Src kinase Lyn controls SHP-1 phosphorylation and is
  involved in TNFα-induced inhibition of IL-10 signaling in human monocytes. (A) Effect
  of NAC (20 mM) or DPI (5 μM) on Lyn(Tyr 396) phosphorylation induced by TNFα (100 ng/ml)
  in human monocytes. (B) Effect of Bafetinib (10 μM) on SHP-1(Tyr 564) phosphorylation
  induced by TNFα (100 ng/ml, left) or H2O2 (5 mM, right) in human monocytes. (C)
  Upper, Bafetinib (10 μM) prevented TNFα (100 ng/ml) inhibitory action on IL-10 (12.5 ng/ml)-induced
  STAT3 phosphorylation in human monocytes. Lower, densitometric analysis of pSTAT3
  normalized to STAT3. (D) Effect of Bafetinib (10 μM) on the phosphorylation of STAT3
  induced by IL-10 (12.5 ng/ml) in human monocytes. All data are presented as mean ± SEM
  with n = 3; one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.005, ****p < 0.0005.
