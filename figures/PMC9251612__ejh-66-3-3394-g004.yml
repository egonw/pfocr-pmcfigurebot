caption: The inhibition of miR-206 in EVs partially reversed the effect of EVs on
  the proliferation, migration, and invasion of OS cells. EVs of different treatment
  groups were added into OS cells for culture. After miR-206 in EVs was inhibited,
  EdU assay showed that cell proliferation rate was increased (A); flow cytometry
  demonstrated that apoptosis was reduced (B); transwell assay showed that cell migration
  (above) and invasion (below) were increased (C). Three cell tests were performed
  and the data were expressed as mean Â± SD. One-way ANOVA was used for comparison
  among groups. Tukey's multiple comparisons test was used for post-hoc test; **p<0.01.
