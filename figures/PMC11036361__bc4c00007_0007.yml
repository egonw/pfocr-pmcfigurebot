caption: (A) Schematic cartoon showing how synthetic analogs of d-Ala-d-Ala enter
  the biosynthetic pathway at the MurF ligation step. (B) Flow cytometry analysis
  of whole cells or sacculi of L. casei. L. casei cells were treated overnight with
  1 mM of DAzDA or DMSO and then labeled as whole cells by treating with 30 Î¼M of
  alkyne-fluorescein. Alternatively, cells were subjected to sacculi isolation steps
  before performing the click reaction. (C) SPF mice were orally dosed with 5 mM of
  DAzDA 2X 1 h apart. Following the second dosing, the animals were moved to a new
  clean cage. Fecal samples were collected at the designated times and subjected to
  sacculi isolation and a click reaction to install the fluorophore. The process was
  performed during daylight and during the night cycles. (D) SPF mice were orally
  dosed with 5 mM of DAzLA 2X 1 h apart. Following the second dosing, the animals
  were moved to a new clean cage. Fecal samples were collected at the designated times
  and subjected to sacculi isolation and a click reaction to install the fluorophore.
  The process was performed during the night cycle. Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI)
  is the ratio of fluorescence levels above the control (DMSO) treatment from 10,000
  events. P-values were determined by a two-tailed t-test (* denotes a p-value <0.05,
  ** < 0.01, ***<0.001, and **** <0.0001, ns = not significant).
