figure_title: Wnt pathway requirement for gland specification
caption: (A-F) st11 gland primordia double labelled with sna-rg-GFP in green, and
  in red the wg expressing cells with a wgen11 reporter line (A-B) or the vvl expressing
  cells with a vvl1+2-mCherry reporter line (C-F). (A) Control sna-rg-GFP wgen11-lacZ/+
  embryo. sna-rg labels specifically the CA and the PG cells invaginating at the anterior
  end of the maxillary and labial segments respectively. (B) In wgen11 homozygous
  mutants, ectopic patches of sna-rg expression appear on the wingless expressing
  cells (arrows) in the maxilla and labium at the same dorso-ventral positions as
  the endogenous ones. (C) Wg ectopic expression driven in the maxillary and labial
  segments with spalt-Gal4 results in the downregulation of sna-rg expression (asterisks).
  Downregulation of vvl1+2 cephalic expression is also observed. (D) Ectopic expression
  of activated Armadillo results in sna-rg downregulation (asterisks). (E) pan2(dTCF)
  null mutants present normal sna-rg expression and Engrailed (blue) stripe expression
  is maintained. (F) wgCX4pan2 double mutant embryos do not present ectopic endocrine
  primordia. Embryo in panel F is also stained with anti-Wg to recognise the homozygous
  wg mutants. Scale bar 50 μm.
