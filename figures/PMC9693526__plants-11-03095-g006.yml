caption: 'Effects of the SSME on the MAPK signaling pathway. The BV2 cells were treated
  with SSME (50, 100, and 200 µg/mL) for 2 h, followed by stimulation with LPS (1
  µg/mL) for 15 min. The cellular protein levels of p38, p44/42 (Erk1/2), and JNK
  were measured by western blotting. The data are presented as the mean ± SEM of three
  independent experiments. Differences between the groups were analyzed using the
  Mann–Whitney U test. # p < 0.05, compared with the untreated group and the LPS-treated
  groups; * p < 0.05, compared with the LPS-treated and SSME- and LPS-treated groups.
  p-, phosphorylated; SAPK/JNK, stress-associated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal
  kinase; ns, not significant.'
