caption: Inflammatory gene expression in lungs from adjuvant control and vimentin-immunized
  mice. (A) Volcano plot showing fold change in gene expression in lungs of adjuvant
  control and vimentin-immunized mice. The 5 maximally and 2 most significantly upregulated
  genes are identified. (B) The top 5 canonical pathways significantly enriched by
  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen). (C) Expression levels of representative TH1
  and TH2 cytokine genes in lungs.
