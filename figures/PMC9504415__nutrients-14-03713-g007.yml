caption: Effect of pinostrobin with H89 on phosphorylated p38 expression in B16F10
  cells. (a) Cells were pre−treated with H89 for 30 min prior to exposure pinostrobin
  (100 μM) for 24 h and then harvested. (b) Blots were quantified using ImageJ software.
  Protein levels were normalized to the corresponding loading controls. The untreated
  cells were regarded as 100%. Values are expressed represent as the mean ± SD of
  three independent experiments. * p < 0.05 compared with control group. NS; not significant.
