caption: MSCs‐EVs carrying miR‐378a‐3p inhibits GATA2/AQP4/PPAR‐α pathway to suppress
  the occurrence of IBD in mice. (A) The expression pattern of miR‐378a‐3p in colonic
  mucosa tissues of mice with different treatment was detected by qRT‐PCR. (B) The
  mRNA expression patterns of GATA2, AQP4 and PPAR‐α in colonic mucosa tissues of
  mice with different treatment were detected by qRT‐PCR. (C) The expression patterns
  of GATA2, AQP4 and PPAR‐α in colonic mucosa tissues of mice with different treatment
  were detected by immunohistochemical staining. (D) Weight loss of mice with different
  treatment during administration was recorded. (E) Colon length of mice with different
  treatment was recorded. (F) The statistical plot was drawn for DAI score of mice
  with different treatment. (G) The statistical plot was plotted for colon tissue
  injury score of mice with different treatment as detected by Haematoxylin and eosin
  staining. Data among multiple groups were compared by one‐way ANOVA and those at
  different timepoints by repeated measures ANOVA, followed by Tukey's post hoc tests.
