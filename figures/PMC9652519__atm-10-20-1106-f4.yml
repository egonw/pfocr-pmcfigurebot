caption: High concentrations of propofol damaged the mitochondria, inhibited AMPK
  activity, increased p53 expression, and activated the downstream apoptosis-related
  pathways in neurons. (A) p-AMPK, AMPK, p53, cleaved caspase-9, Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved
  caspase-3, and CytC protein expression were detected by Western blot assay. (B-H)
  Quantitative analysis of the ratio of p-AMPK to AMPK and p53, cleaved caspase-9,
  Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and CytC to GAPDH (1-way ANOVA, *P<0.05). (I-J) Fluorescence
  images of JC-1 aggregates and JC-1 monomers in each group (1-way ANOVA, *P<0.05).
  (K,L) ATP and ROS content in each group (1-way ANOVA, *P<0.05). Group C, control,
  fresh maintenance medium; Group F, fat emulsion; Group D, 0.25% dimethyl sulfoxide;
  Group P, 100 µM propofol for 3 h; Group CC, 10 µM compound C for 1 h; Group PA,
  100 µM 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribofuranoside for 3 h and 100 µM
  propofol for 3 h; Group T, 5 µM tenovin-1 for 24 h; Group PP, 10 µM pifithrin-α
  for 1 h and 100 µM propofol for 3 h. ANOVA, analysis of variance; ATP, adenosine
  triphosphate; ROS, reactive oxygen species; p53, protein 53; p-AMPK, phospho-adenosine
  5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase; AMPK, adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated
  protein kinase; Bcl-2, B-cell lymphoma 2; Bax, BCL2-associated X protein; CytC,
  Cytochrome C; GAPDH, Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.
