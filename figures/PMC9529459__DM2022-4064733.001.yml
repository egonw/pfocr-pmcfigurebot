caption: HG induces ALK7 expression in MCs. (a) The mRNA expression pattern of ALK7
  in MCs was examined by RT-qPCR in response to 40 mM glucose stimulation for 24 h.
  (b) The protein expression pattern of ALK7 in MCs was examined by western blot after
  stimulation with 40 mM glucose for 24 h. ∗p < 0.05 vs. NG group.
