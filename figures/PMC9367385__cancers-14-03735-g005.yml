caption: 'Genes co-expressed with SH3TC2 and functional enrichment analysis. (A) GO
  and KEGG functional enrichment analyses were performed on SH3TC2 and co-expressed
  genes in CRC. Bioinformatics analysis implied that the MAPK pathway was most likely
  correlated with the expression of SH3TC2. (B) The qRT-PCR analysis of key points
  of MAPK pathway regulators after the stable transfection of shSH3TC2 in HCT116 and
  LOVO cells. The results implied that MAPK8, MAPK9, MAPK13, and MAPK14 were significantly
  regulated after silencing SH3TC2. Statistical analysis was compared to the control
  group: ns, not significant; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001.'
