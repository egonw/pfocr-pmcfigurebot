caption: ACSL4 is critical for SUFU-mediated resistance to RSL3-induced ferroptosis(A)
  Venn diagram of differentially expressed genes (oeSUFU-DE-Gs) between oeSUFU and
  oeControl SK-BR-3 cells as well as ferroptosis regulator genes (Ferr-RGs) recorded
  in the FerrDb database (). Overlapping genes (ACSL4, NNMT, DPP4) and SUFU were highlighted
  and labeled with gene symbols in the heatmap. The color bar denotes the Z score
  normalized TPM (Transcript Per Million) expression value.(B and C) The levels of
  ferroptosis mediators including ACSL4, GPX4, and SLC7A11 in breast cancer cells
  upon SUFU overexpression (B) or SUFU depletion (C) were determined by immunoblot
  (IB) assay.(D and F) Cell viability (D) and GSH/GSSG ratios (F) of SUFU-depleted
  MCF-7 and T47D cells in the absence or presence of RSL3 upon knockdown of ACSL4
  using siRNA.(E and G) Cell viability (E) and GSH/GSSG ratios (G) of SUFU-overexpressed
  HCC1954 and MDA-MB-231 cells in the absence or presence of RSL3 upon ectopic expression
  of ACSL4. Data are presented as mean ± SD (∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001,
  Unpaired t test).
