caption: 'JAM-A regulates proliferation and associates with Hippo regulatory molecules
  LATS1 and NF2(A) JAM-A-deficient mice exhibit increased colonic IEC proliferation.
  Representative confocal images of colon tissue from JAM-AERΔIEC and control (JAM-Afl/fl)
  mice stained for JAM-A (green), Ki67 (red), and DAPI/nuclei (blue). Increased levels
  of proliferating cells in the JAM-AERΔIEC mice compared with controls is shown in
  the graph plotting percentage of Ki67 positive cells/crypt with dots denoting individual
  crypts. Data are means ± SEM of crypts from JAM-Afl/fl and JAM-AERΔIEC mice, respectively.
  ∗∗∗p ≤ 0.001; two-tailed Student’s t test. Scale bar, 50 μm.(B) EdU incorporation
  in 3D enteroids derived from JAM-A−/− and WT (JAM-A+/+) mice indicate that loss
  of JAM-A results in increased proliferation. Data are means ± SEM where buds counted
  from WT and JAM-A−/− enteroids and are denoted as dots on the graph. ∗p ≤ 0.05,
  ∗∗p ≤ 0.01, ∗∗∗p ≤ 0.001: two-tailed Student’s t test. Scale bar, 50 μm.(C) Co-immunoprecipitation
  of ZO-2 and JAM-A with NF2. Whole-cell lysate of SKCO-15 IEC stably expressing a
  full-length HA-tagged JAM-A (HA-JAM-A) was immunoprecipitated with a ZO-2 (ZO-2
  IP) or HA (HA IP) antibody followed by immunoblotting for NF2, ZO-2 and NF2, p-NF2
  S518, and HA-JAM-A. p-NF2 S518 did not co-immunoprecipitate with HA-JAM-A.(D) Representative
  immunostaining of NF2 (green) and JAM-A (red) detected by confocal microscopy in
  WT murine colon tissue demonstrate co-localization at the TJ. Scale bar, 50 μm.(E)
  JAM-A co-immunoprecipitates with multiple Hippo pathway molecules. Immunoprecipitation
  of HA-tagged JAM-A from IEC lysates with an HA-specific antibody (HA IP) followed
  by western blot LATS1, YAP, p-YAP S127, 14-3-3, and JAM-A. Co-immunoprecipitation
  of these molecules with JAM-A is demonstrated.(F) Endogenous JAM-A co-immunoprecipitation
  with LATS1, NF2, and YAP. Immunoprecipitation of LATS1 with LATS1 antibody (LATS1
  IP) from IEC cell lysates followed by western blot for NF2, YAP, JAM-A, and LATS1.
  Co-immunoprecipitation is observed between these molecules.(G) Representative immunofluorescence
  confocal images of LATS1 (green), JAM-A (red), and DAPI/nuclei (blue) in WT murine
  colon tissue. Scale bar, 50 μm. Lysate blots serve as input loading controls in
  (C), (E), and (F). Immunoprecipitation with a nonspecific IgG antibody served as
  a negative control (IgG IP) for (C), (E), and (F). All data are representative of
  three independent experiments. See also .'
