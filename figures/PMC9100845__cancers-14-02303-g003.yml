caption: 'Overexpression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation in GL261 LDH-A
  KD cells. Transcripts per million (TPM) expression values were plotted in individual
  cell lines for genes directly involved in lactate metabolism and export (LDH-A,
  LDH-B, and SLC16A3) (A). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for a single pathway
  (GO_OXIDATIVE_ PHOSPHORYLATION) is shown for each GBM cell line. The analysis shows
  the enrichment of this pathway in LDH-A-depleted vs. control cells (B). TPM values
  for enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (C). The Z-transformed scores
  of individual genes within the oxidative phosphorylation (GO) pathway were plotted
  across each cell line (GL261, CT2A and ALTS1C1). The experiment was performed in
  triplicate, with rows representing each sample and columns representing individual
  genes (D). Expression (TPM) of pyruvate dehydrogenase alpha 1 (PDHA1) and aconitase
  1 (ACO1) was plotted (E). PDHA1 is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial matrix multienzyme
  complex that provides the primary link between glycolysis and the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle by catalyzing the irreversible conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA;
  ACO1 is a bifunctional, cytosolic protein that functions as an essential enzyme
  in the TCA cycle. Significant differences are indicated by: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  and *** p < 0.001.  provides the semi-raw data from the RNASeq analysis that was
  used to generate the figures.'
