caption: '(a) MapMan-based “regulatory overview map” of the “S3_HG vs. S1_HG” group
  of DEGs, including transcription-factors, phytohormones, protein modification, protein
  degradation, receptor kinases, calcium regulation, G-protein, and C & Nutrients
  modules. The small heat map in each section of the figure shows the DEGs mapped
  to the pathway, with a small square indicating a gene. The color of the square indicates
  the expression of that gene at stage 3, with green showing down-regulation and red
  showing up-regulation. Plant hormone-related differentially expressed genes during
  development and ripening in tangor citrus: (b) auxin; (c) abscisic acid; red and
  green represent up- and down-regulation, respectively. Heatmap of DEGs was drawn
  using the log2Foldchange value obtained from the pairwise comparison of samples.
  S3/S1, comparison group of S3 and S1; S2/S1, comparison group of S2 and S1; S3/S2,
  comparison group of S3 and S2. Red and green indicate up-regulation and down-regulation,
  respectively, in the former of the comparisons.'
