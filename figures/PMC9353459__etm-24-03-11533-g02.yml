caption: 'CUR reduces the high glucose-induced cell apoptosis. (A) Detection of apoptosis
  was shown in a two-dimension graph using FITC Annexin V and PI for the Con, HG and
  HG+CUR groups. (B) The cell apoptosis rate was measured with the TUNEL method for
  the three groups. Each error bar is the standard deviation of the mean (n=6). Significance
  level between two test conditions: *P<0.05, **P<0.01. CUR, curcumin; FITC, fluorescein
  isothiocyanate; PI, propidium iodide; Con, control group treated with 5.5 mmol/l
  glucose; HG, high glucose group treated with 33 mmol/l glucose.'

  in HUVECs through the ROS/NF-κB signaling pathway.
