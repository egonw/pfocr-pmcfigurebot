caption: 'Fungi-activated receptors and the downstream signaling pathways of immune
  cells. TLR2 recognizes triacylated and diacylated lipoprotein and peptidoglycan
  of fungi to bind to MyD88, which further activates the ERK and NF-κB pathways to
  trigger cytokine and chemokine expression. TLR4 recognizes O-linked mannan and activates
  the NF-κB and p38/JNK pathways via MyD88. In addition, TLR4 induces TRIF-IRF3-mediated
  release of interferon-β. Dectin-1 recognizes β-glucan and triggers the phosphorylation
  of RAF1 via RAS proteins, ultimately stimulating the NF-κB pathway. Additionally,
  Dectin-1 activates the Syk-CARD9 pathway, which then leads to the production of
  ROS and the activation of NF-κB. Moreover, Dectin-1 also synergizes with TLR2 to
  recognize zymosan and enhance MAPK activation. It activates the NLRP3 inflammasome
  or caspase8 to induce the production of IL-1β and IL-18. NLRP3 is an intracellular
  receptor and forms the inflammasome with caspase1, which promotes the maturation
  of IL-1β and IL-18. DC-SIGN recognizes the N-linked mannan structures of fungi,
  and the signal activates RAF1 to secrete IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12. Moreover, by activating
  the same NF-κB subunit p65, DC-SIGN interacts with the TLR2 and TLR4 pathways to
  promote antifungal reactions. TLR: Toll-like receptor; MyD88: myeloid differentiation
  primary response gene 88; ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinase; NF-κB: nuclear
  factor kappa B; JNK: c-JUN N-terminal kinase; TRIF: TIR-domain-containing adaptor
  inducing interferon-β; IRF3: interferon regulatory factor 3; RAF: rapidly accelerated
  fibrosarcoma; RAS: rat sarcoma; Syk: spleen tyrosine kinase; CARD9: caspase recruitment
  domain-containing protein 9; ROS: reactive oxygen species; MAPK: mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; NLRP3: NOD leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing protein
  3; DC-SIGN: DC-specific ICAM3-grabbing non-integrin.'
