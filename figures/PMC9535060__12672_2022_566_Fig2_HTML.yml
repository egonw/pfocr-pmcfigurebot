caption: RAD51AP1 was identified as a targeted gene associated with poor prognosis
  in ESCC. A The GO functional analysis of overlapping DEGs. B The KEGG pathway analysis
  of overlapping DEGs. C The PPI network of hub genes obtained using the MCODE plugin
  with a total of 9 hub genes being identified in the submodule. D RAD51AP1 was overexpressed
  in ESCC tissues compared to normal tissues based on TCGA database. E RAD51AP1 was
  overexpressed in ESCC tissues compared to matched normal tissues. F The expression
  of RAD51AP1 in diverse cancer types. G High expression of RAD51AP1 was significantly
  associated with worse survival in ESCC patients. H The ROC curve of RAD51AP1 expression
  in ESCC. DEGs, differentially expressed genes; ESCC, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma;
  GO, Gene Ontology; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes; PPI, protein–protein interaction;
  ROC, receiver operating characteristic. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
