caption: Measurement of the gene expression of Bcl-2, Bax, Cyt-C and AIF. NB4 cells
  were treated with different concentrations of realgar (0, 12.5, 25.0, 50.0 and 75.0
  μg/ml) for 24, 48 and 72 h, and the mRNA expression levels of Bcl-2, Bax, Cyt-C
  and AIF were compared to those in untreated cells. (A) Bcl-2 mRNA level; (B) Bax
  mRNA level; (C) Cyt-C mRNA level and (D) AIF mRNA level. The results are expressed
  as the mean ± S.D. (standard deviation) of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001.

  leukemia cell death via the Bcl-2/Bax/Cyt-C/AIF signaling pathway in vitro.
