caption: 'SFK, Lyn and PECAM-1 are constitutively phosphorylated in PT-VWD platelets.
  (A) SFK phosphorylation at Tyr 416 in human control and patient (PT-VWD) washed
  platelets unstimulated (-) or stimulated with ristocetin (0.3 mg/mL) for 30 sec
  under stirring conditions, was assessed by western blotting by loading 30 µg of
  proteins. Densitometric analysis of the pSFK/total SFK ratio was performed using
  Image J software and is expressed in arbitrary units (AU). Data are means ± SEM
  from six independent experiments (Online Supplementary Table S1, samples C, D, E,
  F, G, H) (*P<0.05 vs. control; #P<0.05 vs. resting; two-way ANOVA). The bands shown
  for resting platelets and platelets stimulated with ristocetin belong to the same
  gel. (B) Lyn phosphorylation at Tyr397 in human control and patient (PT-VWD) washed
  platelets unstimulated (-) or stimulated with ristocetin (0.3 mg/mL) for 30 sec
  under stirring conditions, was assessed by western blotting by loading 30 mg of
  proteins. Densitometric analysis of the pLyn/total Lyn ratio was performed using
  Image J software and is expressed in arbitrary units (AU). Data are means ± SEM
  from six independent experiments (Online Supplementary Table S1, samples C, D, E,
  F, G, H) (*P<0.05 vs. control; #P<0.05 vs. resting; two-way ANOVA). The bands shown
  for resting platelets and platelets stimulated with ristocetin belong to the same
  gel. (C) Lyn phosphorylation at Tyr507 in human control and patient (PT-VWD) washed
  platelets unstimulated (-) or stimulated with ristocetin (0.3 mg/mL) for 30 sec
  under stirring conditions, was assessed by western blotting by loading 30 mg of
  proteins. Densitometric analysis of the pLyn/total Lyn ratio was performed using
  Image J software and is expressed in arbitrary units (AU). Data are means ± SEM
  from three independent experiments (Online Supplementary Table S1, samples F, G,
  H) (*P<0.05 vs. control; #P<0.05 vs. resting; two-way ANOVA). The bands shown for
  resting platelets and platelets stimulated with ristocetin belong to the same gel.
  (D) PECAM1 phosphorylation at Tyr686 in human control and patient (PT-VWD) washed
  platelets unstimulated (-) or stimulated with ristocetin (0.3 mg/mL) for 30 sec
  under stirring conditions, was assessed by western blotting by loading 30 µg of
  proteins. Densitometric analysis of the pPECAM1/total PECAM1 ratio was performed
  using Image J software and is expressed in arbitrary units (AU). Data are means
  ± SEM from six independent experiments (Online Supplementary Table S1, samples C,
  D, E, F, G, H) (*P<0.05 vs. control; #P<0.05 vs. resting; two-way ANOVA). The bands
  shown for resting platelets and platelets stimulated with ristocetin belong to the
  same gel. (E) PECAM1 phosphorylation at Ser702 in human control and patient (PT-VWD)
  washed platelets unstimulated (-) or stimulated with ristocetin (0.3 mg/ml) for
  30 sec under stirring conditions, was assessed by western blotting by loading 30
  mg of proteins. Densitometric analysis of the pPECAM1/total PECAM1 ratio was performed
  using Image J software and is expressed in arbitrary units (AU). Data are means
  ± SEM from three independent experiments (Online Supplementary Table S1, samples
  F, G, H) (*P<0.05 vs control; #P<0.05 vs. resting; two-way ANOVA). The bands shown
  for resting platelets and platelets stimulated with ristocetin belong to the same
  gel. (F) PKC substrate phosphorylation in human control and patient (PT-VWD) washed
  platelets unstimulated (-) or stimulated with ristocetin (0.3 mg/mL) for 30 sec
  under stirring conditions, was assessed by loading 30 mg of proteins. Densitometric
  analysis of the PKC substrate/actin ratio was performed using Image J software and
  is expressed in arbitrary units (AU). Data are means ± SEM from four independent
  experiments (Online Supplementary Table S1, samples E, F, G, H) (*P<0.05 vs. control;
  #P<0.05 vs. resting; two-way ANOVA). The bands shown for resting platelets and platelets
  stimulated with ristocetin belong to the same gel.'
