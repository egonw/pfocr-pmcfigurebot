caption: 'CD117lo MLPs arise from distinct direct or stepwise differentiation pathways(A)
  Experimental design: neonatal HSCs (CD34hiCD45RA−CD38lo/−Lin-) were transduced (6-h
  exposure) with a library of barcoded egfp-reporter lentiviruses (transduction efficiency < 30%)
  before intravenous injection to irradiated NSG mice (2 × 105 cells/mouse). Recipient
  mice were sacrificed as aforementioned at week-3 after grafting before the indicated
  hu-CD45+egfp+ multipotent (HSC), lymphoid (MLP, ELP, pro-B; bold characters) or
  myeloid (GMP, Mo prec., DC prec.) subsets were FACS-sorted and processed for analysis
  of barcode repertoires.(B and C) Distribution of barcodes between HSC (+) and HSC
  (−) clones.(B) Right barplot shows percentages of active (HSC [+]) vs. exhausted
  HSCs (HSC [-]).(C) Circle plot shows absolute barcode numbers per HSC (+) or HSC
  (−) clone (referred to as “clone size”); red bars indicate medians; corresponding
  values are indicated. HSC (+) clones: ≥ 1 copy of a unique barcode detected within
  the HSC compartment.(D–H) Lineage output of HSC (+) clones.(D) Barplot showing relative
  percentages of active (a) or quiescent (q) HSC (+) clones (active clone: ≥ 1 copy
  of a unique barcode detected within lymphoid or myeloid subsets).(E) Circle plot
  showing absolute barcode numbers per active (left panel) or quiescent (right panel)
  clone.(F) Immunophenotypic stratification of aHSC (+) clones: barplot showing percentages
  of aHSC (+) clones positive for each the indicated subset (positivity threshold:
  ≥ 1 copy per compartment).(G) Barplot showing the relative proportions of MLP (+)
  clones arising through the direct (Dir) or stepwise (SW) differentiation pathways
  (MLP (+) clones: ≥ 1 copy of a unique barcode detected within the MLP compartment).(H)
  Circle plot shows absolute barcode numbers per Dir or SW MLP (+) clone. Percentages,
  median and absolute values are indicated.(I–M) Lineage output of HSC (−) clones.(I)
  Barplot showing relative proportions of Ly (+) vs. Ly (−) clones (Ly [+] clones:
  ≥ 1 copy of a unique barcode detected within lymphoid MLP, ELP, or pro-B compartments).(J)
  Circle plot showing absolute barcode numbers per Ly (+) or Ly (−) clone.(K) Immunophenotypic
  stratification of HSC (−) clones: barplot showing percentages of HSC (−) clones
  positive for each the indicated cell subset.(L) Barplot showing the relative proportions
  of MLP (+) clones arising through the direct (Dir) or stepwise (SW) differentiation
  pathways.(M) Circle plot shows absolute barcode numbers per Dir or SW MLP (+) clone.
  Percentages, median and absolute values are as aforementioned. Assessment of statistical
  significance was performed with the Mann-Whitney test (∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001; ∗∗∗p < 0.001;
  ∗∗p < 0.01).(N and O) Heatmaps representation of the lineage output of (N) HSC (+)
  (n = 179) or (O) HSC (−) MLP (+) (n = 157) clones. Clustering uses complete linkage
  and Euclidian distance. Dashed areas show differentiation patterns. Diff. ELP output:
  differential ELP output. Color scales are arbitrarily set as “black” for “0” values.(P)
  An integrated model of lymphopoiesis. Differentiation along the direct lymphoid
  pathway (MLP1; dashed blue line) proceeds in absence of multi-lineage diversification.
  Differentiation along the stepwise pathway (MLP2; plain blue line) follows the hematopoietic
  hierarchy with sequential emergence of EBMPs, GMP1-2 and then LMPPs. Following individualization
  of GMP1s, MPP1-2s start downmodulating CD117 to differentiate into CD117int LMPPs.
  At this stage, cells undergo a proliferative burst also resulting in individualization
  of bior unipotent lymphoid or dendritic progenitors. Lymphoid restriction occurring
  at the level of CD117lo MLP1-2s is associated with a proliferation arrest marking
  the first lymphoid development checkpoint. Subsequent dichotomic choice between
  the B (CD127+) and T/NK/ILC (CD127-) pathways relies on a dynamic balance between
  the intrinsic B-lineage bias of CD117lo MLPs and extrinsic Flt3-signaling. Downstream
  progression along the CD127+ B-lymphoid pathway comprises a first phase of amplification
  presumably controlled by low levels of Notch1 and Flt3L signaling that drive progression
  until EBP1s whose subsequent proliferation arrest coincides with IL7R upregulation.
  Downstream EBP2-5 undergoes a second phase of IL7-dependent amplification also driving
  subsequent differentiation into PAX5+ pro-B cells. Differentiation along the T/NK/ILC
  pathway comprises a single wave of Flt3L-dependent proliferation followed by secondary
  diversification into NK, ILC, or T lineage-specified precursors exiting the BM to
  reach the thymus or secondary lymphoid organs. NK precursors become strictly dependent
  on IL-2/15 for subsequent differentiation; common ILC progenitors upregulate IL-7R
  and undergo secondary diversification into ILC1, ILC2 or ILC3 precursors; ETPs leave
  the BM to reach the thymus. Abbreviations: EBMP: eosinophil/basophil/mast cell progenitor;
  GMP: granulomonocytic progenitor; MPP: multipotent progenitors; LMPP: lymphoid-primed
  multipotent progenitor; DCP: dendritic cell progenitor; MLP: multi-lymphoid progenitor;
  ELP: early lymphoid progenitor; EBP: early B cell precursor; NK: natural killer;
  ILC: innate lymphoid cells; ETP: early T cell progenitor. Back and red circles indicate
  lineage branching points; red circles correspond to the cell cycle arrests proposed
  as developmental checkpoints.'
