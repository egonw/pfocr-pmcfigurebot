caption: Pathway analysis of network signaling of 32 proteins represented in the ingenuity
  pathway analysis database included 14 PPs identified in this study (grey shading).
  Only thirty-two (32) of the 100 proteins were mapped in the IPA database and were
  implicated in the pathway analysis of multiple signaling networks including cell-to-cell
  signaling and interaction, cell death and survival, cellular movement, and immune
  cell trafficking (the image was generated using ingenuity pathway analysis program
  (IPA version 49:309) https://qiagen.force.com).
