caption: Transcriptomics and proteomics revealed that chronic heat stress interfered
  with intestinal immunity and caused intestinal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.
  (A and B) Fold change of differentially expressed genes or proteins related to intestinal
  immunity, (D) energy metabolism, (E and F) vesicle transport and protein sorting,
  (G) protein degradation (ubiquitin-mediated proteasome pathway) and protein synthesis;
  (H) the process of heat stress-induced ER stress or abnormal energy metabolism,
  as well as (C) complement cascade activation. (Full name of differential expression
  genes or proteins seen in supplementary file 1 or 3).
