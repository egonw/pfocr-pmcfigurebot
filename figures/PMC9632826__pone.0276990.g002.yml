caption: To explore potential functions of the differentially expressed genes and
  their controlled biological processes, we used the Database for Annotation, Visualization,
  and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) [, ]. Up-regulated genes in esophageal cancer with
  non-complete response were grouped 60 clusters, among which 30 clusters had P-values
  <0.05. These genes are associated with the cellular protein metabolism process,
  glucose homeostasis, TGF-beta receptor signal response pathway, cholesterol homeostasis,
  cell differentiation and response to the drug ( and ). The results of the analysis
  using Metascape are shown in . The up-regulated gene were mainly associated with
  6 GO Biological Processes, including Orexin receptor pathway, regulation of vasculature
  development, response to peptide, lung development, regulation of protein kinase
  activity and response to bacterium. In addition, we analyzed down-regulated genes
  in esophageal cancer with non-complete response (). These genes are associated with
  extracellular matrix disassembly, collagen catabolic process, angiogenesis, immune
  response, cell adhesion and extracellular matrix organization (). The down-regulated
  gene were mainly associated with 9 GO Biological Processes, including NABA core
  matrisome, KRAS.DF.V1 up, PID integrin3 pathway, NABA ECM Glycoproteins, supramolecular
  fiber organization, BMI1 DN MEL18 DN.V1 up, wound heading, morphogenesis of an epithelium
  and positive regulation of cellular component biogenesis ().
