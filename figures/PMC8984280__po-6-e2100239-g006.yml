caption: Gene and pathway changes of pre- and post-HIPEC in metastatic tumor and normal
  patient samples. (A and B) Hierarchical clustered analysis of (A) differentially
  expressed genes in metastatic tumors and (B) normal samples. Cluster 1 was enriched
  for pre-HIPEC; cluster 2 was enriched with post-HIPEC. (C) Volcano plot displaying
  gene expression post-HIPEC by log2-fold change (x-axis) and minus log10P value (y-axis)
  in tumor samples. Significantly upregulated genes of ≥ 2-fold expression are in
  red while statistically significantly downregulated genes of ≥ 2-fold expression
  are in green. The top five differentially expressed genes with fold change (post-
  v pre-HIPEC) and P value shown for tumor samples are shown. (D) Volcano plot displaying
  gene expression post-HIPEC by log2-fold change (x-axis) and minus log10P value (y-axis)
  in normal samples. (E and F) Kegg pathway gene set enrichment analysis of (E) HIPEC
  metastatic tumors and (F) normal samples demonstrating the top significantly upregulated
  and downregulated pathways (FDR < 0.05). Several immune-related pathways are upregulated,
  and DNA replication pathways are downregulated in tumor samples. Normal HIPEC samples
  demonstrate significant downregulation of metabolic pathways. FC, fold change; FDR,
  false discovery rate; HIPEC, hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy; NES, normalized
  enrichment score; q. val., q value; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.
