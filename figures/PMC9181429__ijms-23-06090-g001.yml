caption: 'Effects of ischemia and reperfusion exposure on the expression of sialidase
  Neu3. (A) Ischemia and reperfusion injury in vivo model obtained by temporary ligation
  of the left anterior descending coronary vessel; (B,C) cardiac function was assessed
  by echocardiography. Ejection fraction (B) and fractional shortening (C) are shown
  as percentages, in comparison between sham and animals subjected to IRI. (D) Morphological
  cardiac analysis to assess fibrotic scarring with Masson’s trichrome staining; (E)
  Evan’s blue/TTC double staining schematic representation; (F) sialidase Neu3 expression
  in the infarcted area measured by Real Time PCR (G) sialidase Neu3 expression in
  healthy cardiac tissue measured by Real Time PCR. Data are expressed as relative
  amounts compared with sham animals. Each square in the graphs represent a single
  animal. Statistical significance was determined by the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis
  test.; ** p < 0.01. The # symbol indicates the statistical significance as compared
  to 30′ ischemia: # p < 0.05; ## p < 0.01.'
