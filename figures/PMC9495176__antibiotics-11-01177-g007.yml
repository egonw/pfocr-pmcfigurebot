caption: Pathways under the regulation of the Mn2+ and fluoride riboswitches. (a)
  MntA pathway regulated by the Mn2+ riboswitch. In the presence of Mn2+, the MntR
  protein represses the mntH transporter. This prevents the transport of Mn and also
  upregulates the supposed efflux pump. The downstream genes of the mntP promoter
  are transcribed more than Mn. The addition of the MntR protein allows tighter control
  of the system. In gray ellipses are marked the transporters under the Mn2+ riboswitch
  control. (b) Fluoride riboswitch. The fluoride riboswitch regulates genes encoding
  the proteins crcB and eriC. They are vital for transporting fluoride, hydrogen,
  and chloride ions.
