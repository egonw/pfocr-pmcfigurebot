figure_title: FBXO42 regulates RBPJ chromatin association and transcriptional activity
caption: (A) WT and FBXO42 KO HEK293T cells were harvested and subjected to subcellular
  fractionation. The nuclear, cytoplasm, chromatin, and soluble fractions were isolated,
  and immunoblot analysis was performed. (B) HEK293T cells overexpressing RBPJ WT
  or K175R were harvested, the chromatin and soluble fractions were isolated, and
  the immunoblot analyses were performed. (C) WT and FBXO42 KO HEK293T cells were
  cotransfected with cSFB-RBPJ and Myc-p300. Cell lysates were collected, incubated
  with S-protein beads, and blotted with antibodies against FLAG- or MYC-epitope tags.
  (D) WT and FBXO42 KO HEK293T cells were transfected with cSFB-RBPJ and used for
  S-protein bead pull-down assay, followed by immunoblotting with endogenous antibodies
  as indicated. (E) HEK293T cells expressing RBPJ WT or its K175R mutant were harvested
  and used for S-protein bead pull-down assay, followed by immunoblotting with endogenous
  antibodies as indicated. (F) WT and FBXO42 KO HEK293T cells were transfected with
  cSFB-RBPJ and Myc-FBXO42 WT or ΔF mutant. Then, the histone modifications were evaluated
  with Western blotting using antibodies against H3K4m1 and H3K27ac. H3 and actin
  served as the loading controls. (A) to (F), n = 3. (G) WT and FBXO42 KO HEK293T
  cells were collected for a CUT&Tag assay. Classical RBPJ motif identified in CUT&Tag
  assay was shown. (H) Representative images of RBPJ-binding sites in known Notch
  pathway target genes HES1, HES4, and MYC were shown. HSP90AA1 was used as the negative
  control. (I) Heatmap showing RBPJ CUT&Tag read densities of WT and FBXO42 KO HEK293T
  cells. TSS, transcription start site. (J) Signaling pathway enrichment of genes
  with differential RBPJ-binding affinities based on GO annotation. The size of the
  dots represents the number of genes associated with the GO term, and the color of
  the dots represents the adjusted P values. AMPK, adenosine monophosphate–activated
  protein kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin. (K) Heatmap showing CUT&Tag
  read densities of RBPJ WT and K175R mutant.
