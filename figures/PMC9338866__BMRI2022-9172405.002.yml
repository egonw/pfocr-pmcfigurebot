caption: 'HMM promotes the formation of neovascularization of lumbar intervertebral
  disc tissue. (a) Representative HE staining (10x) of nucleus pulposus tissues, which
  was used to observe the histological degeneration of the intervertebral disc. Scale bar
  = 200 μm. (b) Representative of CD34 expression, determined by immunohistochemical
  staining (40x). Scale bar = 50 μm. (c) Western blotting was used to detect the protein
  expression of VEGF. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. the normal group;
  #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01 vs. the LDH group; and ΔP < 0.05 vs. the HMM group.'
