caption: 'Clobetasol propionate (CP) dose-dependently induces senescence and collagen
  synthesis decrease in human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). Cells were treated with CP
  at doses as indicated for 12, 18, or 24 h. (A) Cell viability was detected using
  the MTT assay. (B) The expressions of β-gal and p53 were evaluated by western blot
  analysis. (C) Cell senescence was identified by β-galactosidase staining. (D) The
  expressions of atrophic marker (FKBP51, GR), collagen synthesis pathway (COL1A1,
  TGF- β1, Smad4, p- smad2/3), and MAPKs (p38, ERK, JNK) were evaluated by western
  blot analysis. Values shown are means ± SE. Quantification of the results is shown
  (n = 3), #p< 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001 versus control of 12 h; $p< 0.05, $$p
  < 0.01, $$$p < 0.001 versus control of 18 h; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
  versus control of 24 h. β-actin was used as a loading control.'
