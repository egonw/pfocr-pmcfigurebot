figure_title: circSCAF8 functions through sponging both miR-140-3p and miR-335 in
  PCa cells
caption: A Bioinformatic analyses revealed that circSCAF8 could sponge four miRNAs
  (miR-140-3p, miR-335, miR-520f-3p, and miR-194-5p) with relatively high scores.
  B, C The expression level of four prediction miRNAs (miR-140-3p, miR-335, miR-520f-3p,
  and miR-194-5p) was analyzed by qRT-PCR after knockdown or overexpression of circSCAF8
  in PC3 and 22RV1 cells. D, F The dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that circSCAF8
  can sponge both miR-140-3p and miR-335, and can suppress the luciferase ability.
  E RNA pull-down through biotin-yoked circSCAF8 probe was executed in 22RV1 cells
  with circSCAF8 overexpression, then RT-PCR and qRT-PCR were applied to verify the
  enrichment of circSCAF8, miR-140-3p, and miR-335. G Western blot analysis showed
  that AGO2 protein was abundantly enriched in the circSCAF8 probe through RNA pull-down
  assay. Error bars represent the SD of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05;
  **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ns nonsignificant, PCa prostate cancer.
