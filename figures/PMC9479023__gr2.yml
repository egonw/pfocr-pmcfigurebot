caption: 'Inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity with apocynin attenuated HG-induced
  ROS production and cell injury in podocytes. (A) Podocytes were pretreated with
  apocynin (100 μM)) for 2 h and then treated with or without HG for 24 h. Intracellular
  ROS production was measured with DCFH-DA staining. (B) NADPH oxidase activity was
  determined with an NADPH oxidase activity assay kit. (C) Immunofluorescence analysis
  of podocin expression in podocytes in different groups. (D) Quantitative analysis
  of the relative fluorescence intensity of DCFH-DA. (E) Phalloidin staining was used
  to label the cytoskeleton of podocytes in different groups. (F) Quantitative analysis
  of the relative fluorescence intensity of podocin. (G) Flow cytometry analysis of
  podocyte apoptosis under different conditions. (H) Quantitative analysis of apoptotic
  cells in Panel G. (∗P < 0.05 vs. NG group, #P < 0.05 vs. apocynin group, and △P
  < 0.05 vs. HG group).'
