caption: 'Reduced Dicer expression levels enhance pressure-induced DNA damage in hepatocytes:
  (A) hepatocytes were treated with different pressure levels (5, 20, 40 mmHg) for
  48 h. Western blot analysis showed the protein level of Dicer; (B) the cells were
  transfected with negative control siRNA or Dicer siRNAs for 48 h. Western blot showed
  the protein level of Dicer after knockdown of Dicer; (C) DNA damage in hepatocytes
  cultured for 48 h under different pressure levels (5, 20, 40 mmHg) with Dicer knockdown
  was examined with the comet assay. OTM and tail DNA% were used to calculate the
  degree of DNA damage (scale bar, 200 µm). Data are expressed as the mean ± SD. n
  = 3, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.'
