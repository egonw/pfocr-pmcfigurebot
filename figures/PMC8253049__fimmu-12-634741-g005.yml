caption: The activation of DDR pathway is accompanied by the down-regulation of the
  TGFβ pathway in mUC cohort. (A) The heat map shows the changes in the average expression
  of the top 5 core genes in the partially significantly enriched pathways in the
  DSSH group of both cohorts. Red indicates upregulation, while blue indicates downregulation.
  The expression levels of core genes in DDR-related pathways, cell cycle and DNA
  synthesis-related pathways were upregulated in the DSSH group, while the expression
  levels of core genes in the TGFβ signaling pathway and lipid metabolism-related
  pathways were downregulated in the DSSH group (adjusted p value < 0.05). (B) Cell
  cycle G1/S transition- and DNA synthesis-related pathways were significantly enriched
  in the DSSH group. (C) The BMP signaling pathway, SMAD protein phosphorylation,
  and the TGFβ receptor signaling pathway were significantly enriched in the DSSH
  group. (D) The relationship between DDR-related pathways and the TGFβ response pathway
  in the TCGA-BLCA cohort. The relevant data of the TCGA-BLCA cohort were derived
  from a study by Vesteinn Thorsson et al. (). (E) The relationship between the degree
  of activation of DDR related pathway and the degree of activation of TGFB pathway
  and the expression of its core genes. The size and color of the circle reflect the
  degree of correlation between the two. Red indicates a positive correlation, while
  blue indicates a negative correlation. The number represents the Spearman correlation
  coefficient. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001.
