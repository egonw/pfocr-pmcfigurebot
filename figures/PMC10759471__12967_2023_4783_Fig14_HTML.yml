caption: a, c, e. Differences in EGR4 and p-AMPK expression in Müller glia after different
  treatments.Compound C inhibited p-AMPK and down-regulated EGR4, on the contrary,downregulation
  of EGR4 did not have an effect on p-AMPK expression. b, d, f. Strips quantified
  using Image J software. Results are shown as mean ± standard deviation, *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01. g, h. Total intracellular ROS and mtROS were measured using DCFH-DA
  probes and MitoSOX probes in Müller by flow cytometry. EGR4 may act both in the
  nucleus and mitochondria, effectively reduced oxidative stress and protected cellular
  functions. Results are shown as mean ± standard deviation, *p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.
