caption: Signaling pathways of Hsp90 in the inflammatory process. Solid blue arrows
  indicate signaling pathways that upregulate Hsp90 expressions in the inflammatory
  process. IL-6 upregulates Hsp90 via both the JAK-STAT3 and the NF-IL6 pathways.
  INF- γ increases Hsp90 expressions through the JAK-STAT1 pathway. Other cytokines/chemokines
  such as TNF and IL-1 can upregulate Hsp90 by activating the NF-kB complex. Dashed
  green arrows denote relevant pathways influenced by Hsp90. Hsp90 binds and stabilizes
  JAK and STAT proteins, as well as the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase HCK, which is
  known to regulate innate immune response. Reciprocatively, Hsp90 is required to
  induce NF-kB. HCK, hematopoietic cell kinase; IL, interleukin; INF, interferon;
  JAK, Janus kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NF-kB, nuclear factor
  kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; Ras, rat sarcoma protein, or Ras
  GTPase protein; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription.
