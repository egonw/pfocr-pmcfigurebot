caption: Kaempferol antioxidant potential via modulation of Nrf2. Reactive oxygen
  species metabolism is inhibited by kaempferol via acting on Nrf2 complex. After
  disintegration of the Nrf2 complex, it is translocated to the nucleus where it binds
  to Maf; as a result, the expression of target genes takes place, eventually causing
  the inhibition of inflammation, oxidation, and induction of autophagy.
