caption: 'The KOR agonist U50448H reduces the levels of ROS and MMP-9 and apoptosis
  in lung tissues of ALI rats. (a) The ELISA results of GSH, MDA, and SOD levels.
  (b) The level of ROS detected by the immunofluorescence assay (scale bar = 50 μm);
  (c) the results of TUNEL staining (scale bar = 50 μm); (d) Western blot analysis
