caption: 'Se activated the Nrf2 signaling pathway in TBHP-exposed NPCs. (a, b) Representative
  western blot bands and quantitation of the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 in NPCs.
  (c) Nucleus translocation and expression level of Nrf2 in NPCs (scale bar: 50 μm).
  (d, e) Representative western blot bands and quantitation of the expression levels
  of Nrf2, HO-1, and SOD2 in NPCs treated with ML385 and Se. (f) Nuclear translocation
  and expression level of Nrf2 in NPCs treated with or without ML385 (scale bar: 50 μm).
  The data are represented as the mean ± SD from at least 3 independent experiments.
  ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. the TBHP group, #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01.'
