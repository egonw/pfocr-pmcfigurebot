caption: Summarized scheme of signaling pathways involved in rNfCB-induced pro-inflammatory
  immune responses of BV-2 microglial cells. NfCB induces a pro-inflammatory immune
  response of BV-2 microglial cells, which is initiated via MyD88-dependent TLR-2/TLR-4
  pathway and mediated by NF-κB- and AP-1-dependent MAPK signaling pathways. The image
  was created with BioRender (https://biorender.com, accessed on 25 May 2022). NfESP,
  excretory and secretory products of N. fowleri.
