caption: Targeting downstream signaling pathways to TLRs recapitulates the effect
  of TLR-knockout on the promotion of K-ras driven lung cancer by COPD-like airway
  inflammation. Lung surface tumor number (n=7-12) (A) and tumor area (n=6-7) (B).
  Representative photomicrographs of whole slide images of lung hematoxylin and eosin
  (H&E) stained sections in CC-LR, LR/MYD88Δ/Δ, and LR/IKKβΔ/Δ mice at 14 weeks of
  age, black arrows depict lung microtumors (C). Data represent mean ± SEM; experimental
  groups are separately compared to CC-LR cohort where *p< 0.05 by unpaired t-test.
article_title: Toll-like receptors 2, 4, and 9 modulate promoting effect of COPD-like
  airway inflammation on K-ras-driven lung cancer through activation of the MyD88/NF-ĸB
  pathway in the airway epithelium.
