caption: 'KDM3A overexpression ameliorated H/R-induced CMEC injury and dysfunctions,
  while suppression of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway reversed these beneficial effects.
  (a) The CCK-8 assay was conducted to measure the proliferative abilities of CMECs
  in each group (n = 6,  ∗p < 0.05, relative to the H/R+Ad-GFP group, #p < 0.05, compared
  to the H/R+Ad-KDM3A group). (b, c) Migration abilities of CMECs after KDM3A overexpression
  or/and PI3K/Akt inhibition were detected by transwell chamber and wound healing
  assays (n = 6,  ∗p < 0.05, compared to the H/R+Ad-GFP group, #p < 0.05, compared
  to the H/R+Ad-KDM3A group). (d, e) Images of tube formation and sprouting assay
  for each group. Neovascularization capacities of CMECs after KDM3A overexpression
  or/and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway inhibition were evaluated. (f) eNOS and NO levels
  in supernatants of each group were measured to determine the synthesis and secretion
  capacities of CMECs (n = 6,  ∗p < 0.05, compared to the H/R+Ad-GFP group; #p < 0.05,
  compared to the H/R+Ad-KDM3A group).'
