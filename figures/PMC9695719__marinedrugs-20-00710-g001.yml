caption: SC prevents glutamate-induced toxicity in HT22 cells. (A) Chemical structure
  of SC. (B) HT22 cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of SC for
  24 h. The statistical symbols (* p < 0.05; n.s., no significance) indicate significant
  differences from the 3.68 μM SC-treated group. (C) HT22 cells were incubated with
  or without indicated concentration of SC for 1 h, and then further incubated with
  5 mM glutamate for 24 h. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. Experiments were
  performed in triplicate. The statistical symbols (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; n.s.,
  no significance) indicate significant differences from the glutamate-treated group.
