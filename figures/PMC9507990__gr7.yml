caption: FoxO1 downregulation reversed the induction of M-MDSCs into M2 differentiation
  by mTOR signaling inhibition Bone marrow cells cultured in a medium supplemented
  with 40 ng/mL IL-6 and 40 ng/mL GM-CSF for 4 days. R848 is used to simulate lupus
  in vitro. INK128, rapamycin and metformin are used to block the mTOR signaling pathway.
  siRNA transfection was used to down-regulate FoxO1. (A) The median fluorescence
  intensity of FoxO1 in bone marrow cells after siRNA transfection was determined
  by FACS. (B) The frequency of M-MDSCs and G-MDSCs were determined by FACS in bone
  marrow cells. (C) The frequency of M1 and M2 were determined by FACS in bone marrow
  cells. (D) The statistical results of the frequency of MDSCs. (E) The statistical
  results of the frequency of macrophages. MDSCs represent myeloid-derived suppressor
  cells. FACS represents fluorescent-activated cell sorting. Data represent the mean
  scores ±SEM. *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001.
