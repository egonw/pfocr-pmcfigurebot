figure_title: Disruption of Sonic Hedgehog signaling affects post-stroke immature
  neuron migration
caption: 'Newly born neuroblasts derived from SVZ dorsolateral corner migrate along
  the white matter tract (A, B, C, Pathway 1), while newly born neuroblasts derived
  from striatal side SVZ region migrate via perpendicular or parallel direction to
  the surface of ventricle wall into the striatum (B, C, D, Pathway 2). Quantification
  data showed significantly decreased migration distance via Pathway 1 (E) or Pathway
  2 (F) at stroke side in Smo cKO mice (Control, n=9. Smo cKO, n=9, 2way ANOVA with
  Tukey’s post-hoc test). All data shown are Mean±SEM. * or # p<0.05, ** or ## p<0.01,
  *** or ### p<0.001. For statistical detail, see .'
