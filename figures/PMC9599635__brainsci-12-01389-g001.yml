caption: CREB protein pathway in Normal individual and HD diseased patient. In normal
  individuals, CREB binding with CRE enables normal neuronal responses by activating
  a cascade of transcriptional factors (A) while in Huntington’s disease patients,
  due to mutant htt gene, CRE transcriptional cascade breaks, and there is no attachment
  of CBP and TAFII 130 with CRE. Pol II dispositioned (B).
