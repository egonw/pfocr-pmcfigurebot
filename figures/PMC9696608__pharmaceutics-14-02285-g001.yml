caption: 'TLR-mediated intracellular signaling pathways. All of TLRs, except TLR3,
  initiate MyD88-dependent signaling pathways, activating NF-κB and MAPKs. TLR3 is
  located in the endosomal membrane and initiates the TRIF-dependent signaling pathway,
  mediating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I interferon. MyD88:
  myeloid differentiation primary response gene (88); IRAK: interleukin-1 receptor-associated
  kinase; TRAFs: TNF receptor-associated factors; MAPKs: mitogen-activated protein
  kinases; AP-1: activator protein 1; TRIF: TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing
  IFNβ; TBK1: TANK-binding kinase 1; IRF3: interferon regulatory factor 3.'
