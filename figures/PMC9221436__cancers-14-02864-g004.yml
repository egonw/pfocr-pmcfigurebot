caption: Luminal A-derived breast cancer stemness/self-renewal inhibiting potential
  of various dietary phytochemicals including Withaferin A, Ginsenoside Rg3 (GRg3),
  Pterostilbene, Hisperidin, and Pristimerin. The phytochemicals target Notch signaling,
  Wnt, hypoxia, NF-ҡB, and Akt pathways involved in the maintenance of stemness and
  self-renewal. Withaferin A reduces the mammosphere formation in luminal A breast
  cancer cells by modulating the expression of Sox2, c-MYC, and CD44 via targeting
  Notch signaling pathway. Pterostilbene inhibits NF-κB, vimentin, and Twist1, and
  elevated E-cadherin expression. Ginsenoside Rg3 inhibits the nuclear translocation
  of HIF-1α, Sox-2, and Bmi-1 marker expression via targeting hypoxia and PI3K/Akt
  signaling pathway. Pristimerin mediated modulation of autophagy and degradation
  of LRP6, a Wnt co-receptor of Wnt signaling pathway and the expression of stemness
  markers. Hesperidin arrest cell progression at G0/G1 phase by targeting cyclin D1.
  Hesperidin modulates the expression of p21 and p53 in luminal A-derived mammosphere.
