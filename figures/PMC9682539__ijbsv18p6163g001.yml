caption: Increased ADCK2 transcripts in NSCLC correlates with poor overall survival
  and poor anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy response. TCGA cohorts revealed ADCK2 mRNA transcripts
  in the listed NSCLC tissues (“Tumor”) and normal lung tissues (“Normal”) (A and
  B). TCGA cohorts showed Kaplan Meier overall survival (OS) curve (C) and progression-free
  survival (PFS) curve (D) of ADCK2-low and ADCK2-high NSCLC patients (B and C). KEGG
  pathway analysis of ADCK2-associated DEGs and the enriched pathways (E). TCGA-LUAD/LUSC
  cohorts show the correlation between ADCK expression and immune cell infiltration
  (F and G). TCGA-LUAD/LUSC cohorts show predicted immunophenoscore (IPS) in ADCK2-low
  and ADCK2-highNSCLC patients (H). ***P < 0.001.
