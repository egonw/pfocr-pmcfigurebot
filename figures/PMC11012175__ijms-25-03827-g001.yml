caption: 'Schematic representation of the metabolic pathway and key compounds involved
  in the synthesis of terpenes from CO2. Abbreviations: CA carbonic anhydrase; CBBC:
  Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle (consuming 1 NADPH, 1 ATP); CrtE: geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate
  synthase; DMAPP: dimethylallyl pyrophosphate; DXP: 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate;
  Fed: ferredoxin; FPP: farnesyl pyrophosphate; FS: farnesene synthase; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3P-dehydrogenase;
  GPP: geranyl pyrophosphate; GPP: geranyl pyrophosphate; GGPP: geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate;
  G3P: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; 3PGA: 3-phosphoglycerate; IPP: isopentenyl pyrophosphate;
  IDI: isopentenyl-diphosphate isomerase; LS: limonene synthase; MEP: methylerythritol
  4-phosphate (it consumes 2 NADPH, 1 ATP and 1 CTP); phaA: acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase;
  phaB: Acetoacetyl-CoA reductase; phaC: PHB synthase; PRK: phosphoribulokinase; Rbc:
  ribulose biphosphate carboxylase (RubisCO); RuBP: ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate. The
  genes manipulated in this study encode the CrtE, CrtR, CruF, PhaA, PhaB, PRK and
  RubisCO enzymes, as well as the CcmK3 and CcmK4 carboxysome shell proteins.'
