caption: Proposed model of how temporal and spatial changes in the epigenome and the
  3D chromatin architecture regulate the transcription of PRGs critical for neuroplasticity
  and memory. The epigenetic status of PRG promoters and enhancers along with the
  formation EPIs by chromatin looping are depicted across sequential stages of fear
  memory ensemble in hippocampal engram neurons. In the naive animal condition (i.e.,
  basal state), basal gene expression of PRGs such as PSD-95 is mediated by a limited
  activation of the promoter (P) (enrichment in H3K4me3 and limited enrichment of
  H3K27ac, H3K9ac and H3K14ac). During short-term memory (i.e., early memory state),
  enhancers (E) are primed (H3K4me1), to subsequently interact through DNA looping
  with their target promoters. During short-lived long-term memory (i.e., intermediate
  memory state)—as a result of the activation of the NMDAR-ERK-CREB-signaling pathway
  that mediates P300/CBP recruitment (see )—H3K27ac becomes significantly enriched,
  leading to both enhancer activation (H3K4me1+H3K27ac) and increased promoter activity.
  Hence, there is an initial establishment of low-frequency EPIs, paralleled by an
  increased transcription of the PRG (depicted under the PSD-95 gene). High-promoter
  and enhancer activation (reflected by high enrichment of the H3K27ac mark) during
  long-term memory (i.e., late-memory state) accompanies robust expression of the
  PRG. During recall, the delayed transcription surge of PRGs is principally mediated
  by a de novo EPI (depicted as enhancer 2, E2).
