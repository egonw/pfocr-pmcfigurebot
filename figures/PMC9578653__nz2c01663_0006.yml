caption: Robust hollow halide perovskite memristors. (a) Migration pathway and (b)
  activation barrier and for Ag ions in standard 3D tetragonal and 44% en-doped CH3NH3PbI3,
  obtained from DFT calculations. (c) The device structure comprises Ag (150 nm),
  PMMA (∼150 nm), en-doped MAPI (∼ 240 nm), and ITO (110 nm) as shown in the SEM device
  cross-section. (d) IV sweep, (e) retention, and (f) endurance characteristics of
  7% en-doped MAPI. The IV sweep represents the evolution of the device conductance
  upon applying DC sweep voltages (0 V → +5 V → 0 V → −7 V → 0 V). For the positive
  sweep direction, a compliance current Icc = 1 mA is applied. This is done to control
  the thickness/number of filaments formed to achieve reliable and controllable switching.
  As observed, the devices switch from a HRS (∼10–10 A) to a LRS (∼ 10–3 A) at ∼1
  V for cycle 1. This is called the “SET” process. In the negative sweep direction,
  Icc is removed to allow higher current flow in the reverse direction. This triggers
  Joule heating within the device and aids erasure of the programmed state. As observed,
  the devices switch from the LRS to HRS at −0.5 V. This is called the “RESET” process.
  The on–off ratio is calculated by comparing the currents at LRS and HRS for the
  same reading voltage (in this case 0.1 V). For retention testing, the devices are
  programmed with a write voltage of +5 V, after which the resistance state is read
  with a reading voltage of +0.1 V. In the next stage, the devices are erased with
  an erase voltage of −7 V, and the resistance state is read with a reading voltage
  of +0.1 V. The pulse width used in all cases is 5 ms. For endurance testing of the
  nonvolatile mode, a write voltage of +5 V, an erase voltage of −7 V, and a read
  voltage of +0.1 V are used in a cyclical fashion, i.e., write-read-erase-read. This
  procedure is repeated until the device completely fails or the desired on–off ratio
  (>103 in our case) is not met. For the retention and endurance testing, the reading
  voltage is chosen to be much smaller than the write and erase voltages to preserve
  the integrity of the programmed states during the reading operation.
