caption: Changes in glycogen content (A), lactate content (B), glycolytic potential
  (C), and pH (D) of bovine muscle when stored at 4 °C for 0.5, 2, 6, 12, 24, 36,
  and 48 h after treatment with 200 μM H2O2 (H2O2 group) and saline (control group).
  Data were expressed as mean ± standard error (n = 6). The capital letters and lowercase
  letters represent the significant difference (P < 0.01) in the same group at different
  times, respectively. * (P < 0.05) and ** (P < 0.01) represent the difference between
  the two groups at the same time point, respectively.

  glycolysis via hypoxia-inducible factor-1α signaling pathway in postmortem bovine
  muscle.
