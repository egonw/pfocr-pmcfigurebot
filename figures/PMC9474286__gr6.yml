caption: Tracking of extra- and intracellular monolignol metabolites during cultivation
  of strain AK_RgTAL. A dashed line indicates the time of induction. (A) CDW (orange
  circles) and glucose consumption (black squares). (B) Extra- (blue squares) and
  intracellular (grey circles) tyrosine titers over time. (C) Extra- (blue squares)
  and intracellular (grey circles) monolignol metabolite titers over time. The numbering
  of metabolites corresponds to . (For interpretation of the references to color in
  this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)
