caption: Proteomic analysis of PMSC-derived lipid rafts. Number of common proteins
  was compared between (A) whole cell lysates, EVs, and lipid rafts from the same
  line and (B) between lipid raft samples from three different cell lines. (C) The
  6168 conserved proteins in lipid rafts from all donors were analyzed for vital structural
  and signaling proteins. Gene ontology searches for (D) biological processes, (E)
  cellular components, (F) molecular functions, and (G) KEGG pathway analysis were
  conducted using FunRich software and DAVID.
