caption: 'STING expression in CRC and adjacent tissues. (A,B) The analysis of the
  COAD GEO (GSE100179) and TCGA data sets confirmed that the protein and mRNA levels
  of STING was significantly increased in the CRC tissues (N: Normal; T: Tumor). (C,D)
  The UALCAN (http://ualcan.path.uab.edu/index.html) results confirmed that the mRNA
  levels of STING was significantly higher in patients with a high histological grade
  (poor differentiation) and a more advanced clinical stage. (E) Hematoxylin and eosin
  staining of CRC tissue sample (10×, scale: 100 µm). (F,G) An IHC method was adopted
  to detect STING expression in 32 pairs of CRC and adjacent tissues (F: 100 µm, G:
  50 µm). (H) IHC scores of STING in 32 pairs of CRC and adjacent tissues: Paired
  samples t-test; IHC score analysis of tumor tissues with and without lymph node
  metastasis. (I,J) The expression levels of STING in CRC and adjacent tissues were
  detected by Western blot, and the gray values of the cancer and adjacent tissues
  were analyzed quantitatively. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. *P<0.05,
  **P<0.01, and ****P0.0001. LNM, lymph node metastasis; CRC, colorectal cancer; TCGA,
