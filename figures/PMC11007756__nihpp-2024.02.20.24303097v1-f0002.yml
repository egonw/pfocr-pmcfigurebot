figure_title: ACOD1 is induced after TLR7 activation in human MDM
caption: 'a) Western blot showing ACOD1 expression in GM and M (GM- and M-CSF, respectively)
  human MDM (Macrophages Derived from Monocytes) after 12 h of treatment with LPS
  100 ng/uL or IMQ 1 μg/mL. b) Western blot showing basal expression of TLR4 and TLR7
  in GM and M MDM. c) Western blot and d) densitometry results showing ACOD1 expression
  in M MDM after TLR7 activation in the presence of different signaling inhibitors.
  Bay 10 μM (NF-κB), BIRB 0.1 μM (p38), SP600125 30 μM (JNK), U0126 2.5 μM (ERK1/2),
  SH-4–54 5 μM (STAT3/STAT5), H-151 1 μg/mL (STING), HAT Inh II 5 μM (HAT II), Trichostatin
  A (TSA) 5 μM (HDAC inhibitor) Graphs show the mean ± SEM, % of expression is relative
  to the IMQ 12h without inhibitor. n = 3, Three blots were processed in parallel
  for a and c. The statistical analysis was done using Mann-Whitney test, *: p<0.05,
  **: p<0.01; ***: p<0.005.'
