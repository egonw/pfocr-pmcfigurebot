caption: MS-Ig has the ability to activate the NKG2D receptor signaling pathway. (A)
  Composition of the human and mouse chimeric NKG2D-2B4 reporter system. (B) Fluorescence
  microscopy images of NKG2D-2B4 cells and 2B4 cells after their incubation with immobilized
  MS-Ig for 16 h. Anti-CD20 IgG, rMICA, and MS were used as the controls. (C) Flow
  cytometry results of the percentage of GFP+ NKG2D-2B4 cells after the co-incubation
  of NKG2D-2B4 cells with immobilized MS-Ig in the presence of soluble binding-blocking
  proteins rMICA and NKG2D-Ig. Anti-CD20 IgG was used as the control. (D) Calculated
  percentages of GFP+ NKG2D-2B4 cells in the presence of MS-Ig at various gradient
  concentrations and in the presence of the binding-blocking proteins rMICA and NKG2D-Ig.
  *P < 0.05, based on the chi-squared test.
