caption: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia modulates gene expression in lung tissues by
  RNA-seq analysis. (A) Constrained PCoA clustering analysis of RNA-seq data. (B–I)
  GSEA Plot for the B cell receptor signaling pathway, Th17 cell differentiation,
  NF-kappa B signaling pathway, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, Propanoate metabolism,
  Citrate cycle (TCA cycle), Carbon metabolism, and Fatty acid metabolism, respectively.
  (J) Heatmap of different genes in lung tissues of S. maltophilia group compared
  with CTL group. (K) Heatmap of different genes in lung tissues of NNK_S. maltophilia
  group compared with NNK group. (L) Heatmap of different genes in lung tissues of
  NNK group compared with CTL group.
