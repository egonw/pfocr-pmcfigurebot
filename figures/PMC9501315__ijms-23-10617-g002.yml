caption: Mechanisms of non-anthracycline-based chemotherapeutic cardiotoxicity. The
  mechanisms of cisplatin toxicity to the heart include oxidative stress, inflammation,
  endoplasmic reticulum stress, and activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways. Cyclophosphamide
  causes myocardial injury mainly by inducing oxidative stress, nitrative stress,
  and inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. MTX activates proinflammatory pathways,
  inhibits Bcl2 expression, and induces cardiomyocyte apoptosis. 5-FU activates mitophagy
  and blocks the TCA cycle, thereby causing mitochondrial dysfunction. CYCL, cyclophosphamide;
  PLA, platinum; vWF, von Willebrand factor; t-PA, tissue plasminogen activator; hs-CRP,
  high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor; NF-ÎºB,
  nuclear factor kappa B; eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase; Keap1, Kelch-like
  ECH-associated protein 1; Nrf2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2. Created
