caption: 'Exosomal HMGB1 played a carcinogenic role by activating PI3K/AKT/FOXO3A
  signaling pathway. A The protein expression of γH2AX varied with the radiation dose
  in cells. B The changes in γh2ax protein expression after 8 Gy IR were related to
  time. C Western blot was used to detect the protein expression of PI3K/pAKT/AKT/pFOXO3A/FOXO3A/γH2AX
  after exosomes treatment. D After treatment with different exosomes, the number
  of γH2AX focus formations was observed by immunofluorescence assay (magnification,
  ×600). HMGB1: high mobility group box 1; IR: irradiation'
