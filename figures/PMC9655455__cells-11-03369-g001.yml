caption: Breast cancer cells and IL-6 upregulate OPG in CAFs through the IL-6/STAT3
  pathway. (A) Whole cell lysates were prepared from the indicated cells and were
  used for immunoblotting analysis. The numbers below the bands represent OPG relative
  expression after correction against the internal control GAPDH. (B) Serum-free conditioned
  media from CAF-64, CAF-87 (CAFs), TCF-64, TCF-87 (TCFs) and NBF-1, NBF-6, NBF-20,
  NBF-25 (NBFs) were collected after 24 h of incubation with SFM and the levels of
  the OPG protein were determined by ELISA. Error bars represent mean Â± SEM, *p <
  0.05; **** p < 0.0001 by Ordinary one-way ANOVA. (C) NBF6 cells were cultured either
  in SFM or in MDA-MB-231 SFCM (MDA-SFCM) for 24 h, and then whole cell lysates were
  prepared for immunoblotting using specific antibodies for the indicated proteins.
  (D) NBF6 cells were cultured either in SFM or SFM containing 3.5 ng/mL of the rhIL-6
  protein for 24 h. Whole cell lysates were prepared for immunoblotting analysis using
  specific antibodies for the indicated proteins. All values were determined by densitometry
  relative to GAPDH and presented as fold change relative to the respective controls.
  (E,F) NBF6 cells were transfected with STAT3 siRNA (STAT3si) or a scrambled sequence
  (Ctrl). Ctrl and STAT3si cells were either not treated (E) or exposed to MDA-MB-231
  SFCM (MDA-SFCM) for 24 h (F). Cell lysates were then prepared for immunoblotting
  using specific antibodies for the indicated proteins. The numbers below the bands
  represent fold change relative to the control (SFM) after correction against the
  internal control GAPDH. The level of the phosphorylated-STAT3 was normalized against
  the non-phosphorylated form of the protein.
