caption: DEGs between DCM and HC from bulk sequencing data. (a) Volcano plot shows
  DEGs between DCM and HC groups. (b) Heatmap shows the expression of DEGs between
  DCM and HC groups. (câ€“f) GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses of DEGs from bulk
  sequencing data. GSEA for pathways in KEGG includes renin angiotensin system, gap
  junction, pathogenic Escherichia coli infection, and complement and coagulation
  cascades. GSEA for molecular function in GO includes immunoglobulin receptor binding,
  antigen binding, organic acid binding, extracellular matrix structural constituent,
  and flavin adenine dinucleotide binding. GSEA for biological process in GO includes
  acute phase response. GSEA for cellular component in GO includes T cell receptor
  complex, collagen trimer, immunological synapse, immunoglobulin complex circulating,
  secretory cranule membrane, polymeric cytoskeletal fiber, and tertiary granule membrane.
