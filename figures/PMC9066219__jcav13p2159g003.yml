caption: Effect of BLVRB overexpression on cholangiocarcinoma cell migration and invasion
  in vitro A. Stable BLVRB overexpression in RBE cells was verified by western blotting
  analysis. B. RBE cell migration from the upper transwell chamber to the lower chamber.
  The overexpression of BLVRB impaired the migration of RBE cells. C. RBE cell invasion
  from the upper transwell chamber to the lower chamber. The overexpression of BLVRB
  impaired the invasive ability of RBE cells. D. Protein levels of key EMT markers,
  including E-cadherin, claudin, N-cadherin, Snail, and ZEB, after the overexpression
  of BLVRB in RBE cells. All experiments were performed in triplicate.
