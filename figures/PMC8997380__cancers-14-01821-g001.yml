caption: Principle of synthetic lethality. In glioblastoma (GB) therapy, DNA damage
  is induced by temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation therapy (RT). DNA repair pathways
  are often disrupted (pathway A) and therefore GB cells solely depend on a back-up
  pathway to repair DNA damage. Inhibitors of essential DNA damage response kinases
  (DDRi) can block this rescue pathway to promote GB cell death.
