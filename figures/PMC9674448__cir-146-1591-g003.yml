caption: NR1D1 perturbs mitochondrial metabolism by the TCA cycle in AAA. A, Heatmap
  of differentially expressed genes in ApoE−/−/Nr1d1flox/flox-AngII and ApoE−/−/Nr1d1ΔSMC-AngII
  groups. Each column represents an individual replicate, and each row represents
  an individual gene. Upregulated genes are shown in red, and downregulated genes
  are displayed in blue. n=3 for both groups. Differentially expressed genes were
  defined as genes with a Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted P value <0.05 and |log2(fold
  change)|≥1. B, Volcano plot reveals the magnitude and significance of altered genes
  in ApoE−/−/Nr1d1flox/flox-AngII and ApoE−/−/Nr1d1ΔSMC-AngII groups. Differentially
  expressed genes were defined as genes with a Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted P value
  <0.05 and |log2(fold change)|≥1. C, The top 10 Kyoto Encyclopedia Genes and Genomes
  (KEGG) pathways of differentially expressed genes. D, Heatmap of differential plasma
  metabolites in ApoE−/−/Nr1d1flox/flox-AngII and ApoE−/−/Nr1d1ΔSMC-AngII groups.
  n=7 for ApoE−/−/Nr1d1flox/flox-AngII, n=6 for ApoE−/−/Nr1d1ΔSMC-AngII. Differential
  metabolites in plasma were identified using variable important in projection (VIP)
  values of >1.2 in an orthogonal partial least squares–discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA)
  model. E, Multi-omics joint pathway analysis of transcriptomes and metabolomes.
  The highest ranked pathway is the TCA cycle. F, A combined analysis of transcriptome
  and metabolome profiles identified ACO2 in the TCA cycle as the potential target
  of NR1D1. The schematic illustration of intracellular metabolites and enzymes in
  the TCA metabolic pathway (modified from the combined analysis). CS, IDH, and OGDH
  are rate-limiting enzymes in the TCA cycle. G, Heatmap of differential plasma metabolites
  in patients with AAA and matched control subjects (n=20 per group). Differential
  metabolites in plasma were identified using VIP values of >1.2 in an OPLS-DA model.
  H, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of human metabolomics. I through M, Relative
  abundances of (iso)citric acid, cis-aconitic acid, and αKG, and αKG to (iso)citrate/cis-aconitate
  ratios in patients with AAA and matched control subjects (n=20 per group). Data
  were analyzed by Student t test (I, J, and L) or Mann-Whitney U test (K and M).
  *P<0.05; **P<0.01; ***P<0.001. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. AAA indicates abdominal
  aortic aneurysm; ACO2, aconitase-2; αKG, α-ketoglutarate; AngII, angiotensin II;
  CS, citrate synthase; FH, fumarate hydratase; IDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase; MDH,
  malate dehydrogenase; NR1D1, nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group D member 1; OGDH,
  oxoglutarate dehydrogenase; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase; and TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid.
