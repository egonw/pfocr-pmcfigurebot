caption: 'Disease Ontology (DO) and Metascape analyses of DEGs. (a) DO enrichment
  analysis was performed on DEGs. The x-axis shows the number of genes enriched on
  the terms, and the y-axis shows the pathway terms. The q value of each term is colored
  according to the legend. DEGs are differentially expressed genes. (b) The network
  of the top 20 enriched term clusters. The color indicates cluster identification,
  the thickness of the edge indicates the similarity score, and terms with a similarity
  score>â€‰0.3 are connected by an edge. (c) The top 20 clusters are shown in a heat
  map. Color is used to indicate cluster identification: the lower the P value, the
  darker the color.'
