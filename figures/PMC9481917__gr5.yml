caption: Loss of EED alters the epigenetic state on the Gli3 promoter(A) Heatmaps
  display enrichments for EED, H3K27me3, H3K27ac, and RNA-Pol2 within EED-binding
  promoters (±5 Kb) in E12.5 WT forebrain. WT, n = 1; Eed cKO, n = 1.(B) Plots of
  average enrichment profiles within ±5 Kb promoter regions of annotated EED-binding
  genes for EED, H3K27me3, H3K27ac, and RNA-Pol2.(C) Bar chart indicates normalized
  EED-binding levels within the genome promoter regions in E12.5 WT and Eed cKO forebrains.(D)
  Heatmaps shows enrichment for EED, H3K27me3, H3K27ac, and RNA-Pol2 within ±3 Kb
  promoter regions of all GENCODE annotated genes.(E) Plots of average enrichment
  profiles within ±3 Kb promoter regions of all GENCODE annotated genes.(F) Venn diagram
  of a combined comparison between differentially expressed genes and differentially
  binding genes.(G) Network diagram indicates enriched GO terms (p < 0.0001) in a
  combined gene set (56 genes, with decreased EED binding, decreased H3K27me3 binding,
  increased H3K27ac binding, and RNA-seq up-regulated).(H) The network diagram exhibits
  Hedgehog pathway genes, which are enriched by KEGG from the same gene set in (G).(I)
  Venn diagram of a combined comparison between gene set “A” (generated in {), top
  200 potential targets, and 828 mouse factors.(J) Genome browser views of ChIP-Seq
  and CUT&Tag-seq data at the Gli3 loci in the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV).
