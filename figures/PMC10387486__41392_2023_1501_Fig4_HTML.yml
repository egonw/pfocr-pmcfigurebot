caption: Cellular mechanotransduction of ECM stiffness. The integrins convey mechanical
  and biochemical signals from ECM into cells and facilitate cell proliferation, differentiation,
  migration, and invasion. The RhoA/ROCK pathway is activated, enhancing collagen
  and fibronectin accumulation. Talin/FAK facilitates the assembly of F-actin to promote
  signal transduction. The actin connects with myosin II and conveys the mechanical
  cues to the nucleus. YAP/TAZ is translocated into the nucleus to promote the transcription
  of downstream genes, collagen synthesis, and cell differentiation. ECM extracellular
  matrix, ER endoplasmic reticulum, ERK extracellular signal-related kinase, FAK focal
  adhesion kinase, ILK integrin-linked kinase, P phosphate, TGFβ transforming growth
