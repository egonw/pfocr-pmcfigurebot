caption: 'Integrated gene-metabolite network analysis. (A) Venn diagram comparing
  DMGs and DEGs. A total of 13 genes were identified from up- and down-regulated DMGs
  and DEGs. There were three groups identified: G1 (n = 10) genes were hypermethylated
  in the promoter with high gene expression level in tumor; G2 (n = 1) genes were
  hypermethylated in the promoter with low expression in tumor; G3 (n = 2) genes were
  hypomethylated in the promoter with high expression in S tumors. (B) Pearson correlation
  analysis of G2 and G3 genes; R = -1, p = 0.027. Epi and RNAseq stand for the fold
  change of given genes in methylation levels and RNA expression in S samples. (C)
  KEGG pathway analysis of G2 and G3 genes; p > 0.05. (D-E). Kaplan-Meier survival
  curves show the correlation between marker gene expression and distant metastasis
  free survival (DMFS), post progression survival (PPS), and progression free survival
  (PFS) in breast, lung, and gastric cancer. Gene expression in different breast cancer
  types on the top. FPKM: fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments
  mapped. (F) Metabolite-gene interaction network analysis related to fatty acid metabolism
  and cancer pathways. The correlation network is composed of five metabolite compounds
  combined with 18 genes. Metabolites are represented by blue diamonds and genes by
  circles. Yellow: up-regulated DEGs. Grey: down-regulated DEGs. Red: hypermethylated
  DMGs. Green: hypomethylated DMGs. Metabolites with KEGG annotations from the merged
  data set were mapped to KEGG reference pathways, and interaction networks were generated
  in MetaboAnalyst5.0 (p < 0.005).'
