caption: Evodiamine inhibits STAT3 activation and cMyc expression in AGS and MKN45
  cells. Indicated dose of evodiamine (0, 1, 5, and 10 μM) for 24 h were applied to
  (A) AGS and (B) MKN45 cells. A total of 10 μM evodiamine for the indicated time
  periods (0, 6, 12, 24 h) were treated in (C) AGS and (D) MKN45 cells. The cell lysates
  were subjected to Western blot to evaluate the levels of STAT3, p-STAT3, and c-Myc.
  β-actin was used as an internal control. EVD, evodiamine.
