caption: 'HEMO upregulation is associated with an active Wnt/β‐catenin pathway in
  UCEC cohort. (A) Top 20 GO (Gene Ontology) BP (Biological Process) gene sets with
  the highest significance in UCEC cohort, extracted from Table . In red: Wnt signaling
  pathways. (B) GSEA enrichment plots showing ‘GO canonical Wnt signaling pathway’
  and ‘GO negative regulation of Wnt signaling pathway’ enriched signatures between
  UCEC HEMOHigh vs HEMOLow tumors. NES: Normalized Enrichment Score. (C) Mutational
  status of CTNNB1 and APC in UCEC HEMOHigh and HEMOLow tumors, 53 cases of each (P‐value,
  Fisher''s exact test). For comparison, mutational status of the total UCEC cohort
  is indicated. (D) Heatmap for the significant Wnt‐related genes differentially expressed
  between HEMOHigh and HEMOLow tumors. Color gradation is representative of Log2 fold
  change. The differential level of HEMO expression is also indicated at the top of
  the heatmap (LogFC = 7). For all depicted genes, adjusted P‐value is < 0.01 (except
  for APC and CTNNB1, NS: nonsignificant). In bold, common upregulated genes found
  in COAD cohort (Fig. B).'
