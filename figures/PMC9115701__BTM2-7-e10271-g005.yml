caption: Ventilation exposure modulates apoptotic pathways and epithelial inflammatory
  cytokine secretions. Cells and culture medium were collected from models 24 and
  48 h following ventilation exposure and compared with baseline levels. Air ventilation
  was performed for 4 h, or the ventilator machine kept off for the same duration
  as a control. Following the exposure, culture medium was filled back into the models.
  (a‐c) An increase in apoptotic cells indicates a biotraumatic response. Cells were
  collected from models and analyzed using flow cytometry (FACS) following Annexin‐V
  and Propidium Iodide (PI) staining. The % total population of (a) live cells decreased
  by 60% at 24 h and 75% at 48 h in the ventilated group relative to the control,
  which is largely unaffected at either time point. Most of this increase in nonviable
  cells is found in (b) the apoptotic, ventilated group while (c) negligible necrotic
  cells were counted for either exposure group. The increase in apoptosis was consistent
  in models analyzed both 24 and 48 h following the exposure experiment. (d‐f) Changes
  in the secretion of inflammatory cytokines following ventilation suggest a signaling
  pathway. Cytokines IL‐6 (d), IL‐8 (e), and IL‐10 (f) were measured in culture medium
  collected from the models after 24 and 48 h periods before and following simulated
  ventilation, respectively. Measurements from repeated experiments are plotted as
  normalized fold change to highlight signaling changes resulting from the test exposure.
  In (d) and (e), we measured a significant reduction in pro‐inflammatory IL‐6 (75%
  at both 24 and 48 h) and IL‐8 (50% at 24 h) relative to the control, while conversely
  in (f), we find that IL‐10, an anti‐inflammatory cytokine, is elevated >30% at the
  24‐h time point compared with the control. All values are normalized relative to
  their baseline, that is, divided by pre‐exposure secretory levels. Cytokines were
  measured using ELISA. All graphs show mean (SD) values. *p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01;
