caption: Analysis of DEGs and pathways derived from mouse spleens infected with P.
  multocida. (A) Heatmap of DEGs. Colors from blue (low) to red (high) represent DEG
  expression level. Each row in the map represents a sample, and each column represents
  a gene. (B) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of up-
  and down-regulated DEGs. Dot size represents the number of genes. The rich factor
  indicates the ratio between the number of genes annotated for a KEGG pathway and
  the number of all genes annotated for the KEGG pathways.
