figure_title: 'Differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs in IBD versus healthy control
  tissues. (a, b) Heatmaps depict the total lncRNAs and mRNAs determined in the colon
  of IBD and HCs. Red represents upregulated genes and blue represents downregulated
  genes. (c) The distribution image of JS score density illustrates the tissue specificity
  of lncRNAs and mRNAs. (d, e) Heatmaps depict the differentially expressed lncRNAs
  and mRNAs in IBD patients and HCs with a difference greater than 2-fold. Yellow
  represents high expression and blue represents low expression. (f) The volcano plot
  was constructed with fold-change values and P-values. Red represents upregulated
  genes, green represents downregulated genes, and gray represents unchanged genes.
  (g) The histogram indicates the numbers of differentially expressed known lncRNAs,
  novel lncRNAs, and mRNAs. (h) The pie chart depicts the percentages of the different
  types of novel lncRNAs (lincRNA, intronic lncRNA, and antisense lncRNA) identified.
  lncRNAs: long non-coding RNAs; mRNAs: messenger RNAs; IBD: inflammatory bowel disease;
  HCs: health controls; JS: Jensen-Shannon; lincRNAs: long intergenic non-coding RNAs'
