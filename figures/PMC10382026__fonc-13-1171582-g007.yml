caption: Expression and interaction analysis of 201 genes related to chemotherapeutic
  response prediction. (A) Integrating gene expression profiles, pathway enrichment
  analysis, and gene interactome information of differentially expressed genes between
  201 chemotherapy responsive and non-responsive ovarian cancer patients associated
  with chemotherapy response in a circular plot. Gene symbols are listed in the outermost
  circles, followed by statistical significance (stars), gene expression profiles
  in chemo responders (external heat map of 50 samples) and chemo nonresponders (internal
  heat map of 38 samples), the top 10 enrichment pathways (gray circles with colored
  bars indicating genes found in these pathways in the dataset), hub genes (red gene
  names with ≥ 10 interactions with other genes in the dataset), and gene–gene interactions
  (circle size proportional to the number of interactions). (B) PPI network showing
  the interactions of the 201 genes (interaction score = 0.7). PPI, protein–protein
  interaction. (C) Expression of EEF1A1, RPL35A, RPL31, RPL11, RPS12, and RPS23 in
  Merge cohort (containing GSE15622, GSE63885, GSE51373, GSE23554, GSE28739, and GSE156699).
  (D) Expression of EEF1A1, RPL35A, RPL31, RPL11, RPS12, and RPS23 in OV tumor tissues
  of chemotherapy responders and nonresponders by qRT-PCR. * represents p < 0.05,
  ** represents p < 0.01, *** represents p < 0.001, and ns indicates no significance.
