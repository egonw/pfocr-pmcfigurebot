caption: Metformin promoted autophagy in mouse cardiomyocytes through the AMPK/mTOR
  pathway(A) AMPK/mTOR pathway and its phosphorylated protein expression levels in
  tissues adjacent to infarcted myocardium in different treatment groups. (B) qPCR
  was used to detect the knockdown effect of si-AMPK in primary mouse cardiomyocytes.
  (n = 3; SD; ∗∗∗p < 0.001) (C) Comparison of different treatments on GFP-LC3 punctate
  aggregation of mouse cardiomyocytes in vitro (negative control, 1 μM met, 100 μM
  met and si-AMPK + 100 μM met). The left side shows representative photos of GFP-LC3
  mouse cardiomyocytes. Scale bar, 20 μm. The percentage of cells with GFP-LC3 punctate
  aggregation is shown on the right. (n = 3) (D) Autophagy-related proteins LC3II/I
  and p62, AMPK/mTOR pathway, and their phosphorylated protein levels in mouse cardiomyocytes
  cultured in vitro. (E) Masson staining of representative left ventricular section.
  The right panel shows infarct sizes. LV, left ventricle; INF, infarct area. Scale
  bar, 2,000 μm; n = 3; ∗∗∗p < 0.001. (F) Transmission electron microscope representative
  pictures of the tissues adjacent to the infarcted myocardium in met + lv/sh-scramble
  group and met + lv/sh-AMPKα2 group. Scale bar, 1 μm.
