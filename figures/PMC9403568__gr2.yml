caption: Hypoxia decreases miR-494 expression confer the resistance of TNBC cells
  to DTX. (A) qPCR validation showing miR-494 expression level was significantly decreased
  in hypoxic TNBC cells. (B) MiR-494 expression level was significantly increased
  after transient transfection of miR-494 mimic in hypoxic TNBC cells as measured
  by qPCR. (C) MiR-494 expression level was significantly decreased after transient
  transfection of miR-494 inhibitor in normoxic TNBC cells as measured by qPCR. (D)
  Overexpression of miR-494 induced by mimics transfection significantly enhanced
  the growth-inhibitory effect of DTX in hypoxic TNBC cells by CCK assay; (F) increased
  hypoxic TNBC cells apoptosis level to DTX by DNA fragmentation assays; (H) and increased
  cleaved Caspase 3 level by western blot analysis. (E) Down-regulation of miR-494
  induced by inhibitors transfection significantly decreased normoxic TNBC cells growth
  under DTX treatment by CCK assay; (G) decreased normoxic TNBC cells apoptosis level
  to DTX by DNA fragmentation assays; (I) and decreased cleaved Caspase 3 level by
  western blot analysis. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. Each bar represents the mean ± SD
  of three independent experiments.
