caption: The average percentage of TPH-1, SERT, 5-HTR2A, ERK1/2 and pERK1/2 positive
  pneumocytes (a), PAMs (b) and bronchial epithelial cells (c) in the control, degenerative
  mitral valve disease (DMVD) and degenerative mitral valve disease with pulmonary
  hypertension (DMVD with PH) groups. Data are presented as mean and standard deviation
  (bars). a Indicate significant difference at p < 0.05 compared to the control group.
  b,c Indicate significant difference at p < 0.05 between the DMVD and DMVD with PH
  groups.
