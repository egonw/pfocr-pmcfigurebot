caption: Role of LLPS in oncogenic signaling. (A). In Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway,
  Axin, and APC assemble into a destruction complex condensate that recruits other
  members such as GSK3 and CKI. β-catenin accumulates and is transported to the nucleus,
  where it may localize to condensates at super-enhancers to activate the expression
  of target genes. (B). YAP/TAZ condensates co-localize with TEAD and recruit RNA
  Pol II to promote the expression of downstream target gene. (C). TGF-β promotes
  the expression of DACT1, which through LLPS is required for compartmentalising hundreds
  of proteins including CK2.
