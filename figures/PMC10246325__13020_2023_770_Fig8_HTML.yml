caption: 'Mechanism of FJHQ inhibition of autophagy and synergistic effect of FJHQ
  and chemotherapy drugs. Cisplatin and paclitaxel induce mitochondrial damage to
  release ROS. However, the autophagy pathway removes damaged mitochondria and weakens
  the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy drugs. As a novel late-stage autophagy inhibitor,
  FJHQ inhibits the maturity of cathepsin in lysosome, thus blocking autophagy pathway.
  When combined with FJHQ, the damaged mitochondria cannot be cleared through the
  normal autophagy pathway, leading to excessive ROS accumulation and further activation
  of the MAPK pathway. FJHQ Fangjihuangqi Decoction, Cis Cisplatin, PTX Paclitaxel:'
