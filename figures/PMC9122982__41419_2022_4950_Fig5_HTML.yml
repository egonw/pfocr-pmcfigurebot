figure_title: METTL3 modification of EphA2/VEGFA promotes VM in CRC cells via PI3K/AKT
  and ERK1/2 signaling in vitro and in vivo
caption: A Cell proliferation was measured using an MTT assay after METTL3 knockdown
  and EphA2/VEGFA overexpression. B Migration and invasion efficiency elucidated by
  transwell assay. C Summary graphs showing the numbers of colonies counted. D Representative
  images of tube formation by HCT116 cells and METTL3-deletion cells overexpressing
  EphA2/VEGFA after 48 h. Scale bars, 200 µm. E–G EphA2 expression detected by qRT-PCR
  and western blotting after successful overexpression of EphA2 and VEGFA. H Effect
  of METTL3 deletion on the AKT/ERK1/2 signaling pathway. p values were calculated
  using the t test from three independent experiments. **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. WT
  wild-type cells, KD-M3 METTL3 knockdown, Vector, cells transfected with GV230 empty
  vector.
