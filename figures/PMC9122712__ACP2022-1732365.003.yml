caption: FSCN1 is the target gene of miR-585-3p. (a) qRT-PCR was used to detect the
  expression of target genes in OC cells and normal ovarian cells. (b) RT-PCR was
  used to detect the changes of FSCN1 expression after overexpression or interference
  of miR-585-3p. (c) Western blot was used to detect the expression of FSCN1 protein
  after miR-585-3p overexpression or interference. (d) The luciferase activity after
  cotransfection of miR-585-3p inhibitor and FSCN1 WT-3′UTR was detected by double
  luciferase reporter assay in SKOV3 cell line. (e) The luciferase activity after
  cotransfection of miR-585-3p mimic and FSCN1 WT-3′UTR was detected by double luciferase
  reporter assay in SW626 cell line. ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001.
