caption: Inhibition of β-catenin disables Ly6D-mediated chemoresistance in LSCC cells.
  (A, B) Tu686 cells with Ly6D knockdown were transfection of psin-flag-β-catenin
  plasmids in the presence of various concentrations of cisplatin for 24 h and then
  analyzed by CCK8 (A) and clonogenic assay (B). (C, D) Tu686 cells with Ly6D overexpression
  were transfected of sh-β-catenin plasmids in the presence of various concentrations
  of cisplatin for 24 h and then analyzed by CCK8 (C) and clonogenic assay (D). (E,
  F) Tu686 cells with Ly6D overexpression were treated with 2 μM ICG001 in the presence
  of various concentrations of cisplatin for 24 h and then analyzed by CCK8 (E) and
  clonogenic assay (F).
