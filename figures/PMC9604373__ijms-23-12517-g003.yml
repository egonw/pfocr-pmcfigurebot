caption: 'Progestins enhanced the growth of THRB-silenced EC cells. (A) THRA or THRB
  silencing efficiency in RL95-2 and KLE cells. (B,C) Protein expression of TRα or
  TRβsilencing in RL95-2 and KLE cells. (D,G) Cell viability after silencing THRA
  or THRB in RL95-2 and KLE cells. The cells were treated with si-THRA or si-THRB
  for 48 h and then cultured in fresh media for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. (E,F) RL95-2
  or (H,I) KLE cells were pretreated with si-THRA or si-THRB for 48 h and then treated
  with 30 μM MPA (E,H) or NOMAc (F,I); meanwhile, 100 nM T3 was added for 48 h to
  examine cell viability. The cell viability was normalized to the control, which
  was set at 100%. The results are presented as mean ± SEM of three independent experiments.
  TRα/THRA, thyroid hormone receptor alpha; TRβ/THRB: thyroid hormone receptor beta;
  si-Ctrl, negative control treated with siRNA solvent; si-THRA, silenced THRA; si-THRB,
  silenced THRB.'
