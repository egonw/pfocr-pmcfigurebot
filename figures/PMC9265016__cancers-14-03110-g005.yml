caption: RORγ antagonists possess synergism with statins in killing mCRPC cells and
  abolish statin-induced feedback activities in cholesterol biosynthesis gene program.
  (a) Total cholesterol levels in relative florescent units/protein, measured by AmplexTM
  Red Cholesterol Assay Kit of 22Rv1 cells treated with indicated concentration of
  XY018, Simvastatin, or their combination for 72 h. (b,c) Drug combination synergism
  maps of 22Rv1 (b) and C4-2B (c) cells treated with XY018 and SMV as indicated concentration
  for 4 d. Blue indicates synergy, while red indicates antagonism between drugs. (d)
  Venn diagram of the number of genes with expression significantly downregulated
  by XY018 (5 µM), or upregulated by SMV (5 µM), or downregulated by XY018 + SMV combination
  in 22Rv1 cells treated for 48 h, which are detected by RNA-seq. as detected by RNA-seq
  of 22Rv1 and C4-2B cells treated with 5 µM of XY018 for 48 h (top). (e) Gene ontology
  analysis of the 222 genes overlapped in expression alterations as shown in (d) in
  response to indicated compound treatment. (f) Heat map of mRNA expression changes
  in 21 cholesterol biosynthesis genes, as detected by RNA-seq in 22Rv1 cells treated
  with indicated concentrations of XY018 (5 µM), SMV (5 µM), ATV (5 µM), or XY018
  + SMV/ATV combination (1.25 µM) for 48 h, as compared to vehicle (DMSO). (g) Heat
  map of mRNA expression changes in 21 cholesterol biosynthesis genes, as measured
  by qRT-PCR in C4-2B cells treated with XY018 (5 µM), SMV (5 µM), or XY018 + SMV
  combination (1.25 µM) for 48 h, as compared to vehicle (DMSO), n = 3. (h,i) Immunoblotting
  of proteins involved in cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in 22Rv1 (h) and C4-2B
  (i) cells treated with indicated concentrations of XY018, SMV, FLV, PTV or combinations
  of XY018 + statins for 72 h. Data are shown as mean ± s.d. n = 3. Student’s t test.
