caption: 'The expression of CPSF7 in three LUAD cell lines (A549, H1299, and HCC827)
  and a normal lung epithelial cell line (BEAS‚Äê2B). (a) mRNA expression of CPSF7 was
  measured by RT-qPCR; (b) protein expression of CPSF7 was measured by Western blotting.
  Each experiment was repeated three times (n = 3). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01 vs BEAS-2B;
  ##P < 0.01 vs A549.'
article_title: Silencing of CPSF7 inhibits the proliferation, migration, and invasion
  of lung adenocarcinoma cells by blocking the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
