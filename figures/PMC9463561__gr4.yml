caption: circBRWD1 directly binds to mRNA (c-JUN, c-MYC, and CDK6 mRNA) and affects
  its stability(A) Volcano plot showing differentially expressed mRNAs. (B) Pathway
  enrichment analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs with the KEGG website. (C)
  Bioinformatics analysis of mRNAs that can directly bind to circBRWD1. (D) The relationship
  between circBRWD1 and the expression of eight mRNAs was assessed by qPCR. (E) Specific
  assembly area. (F) Schematic diagram of the experimental vector carrying the dual
  luciferase reporter gene. (G–I) The binding sites in circBRWD1 for c-JUN, c-MYC,
  and CDK6 were mutated, and the dual-luciferase reporter gene was used for detection.
  (J) Schematic diagram of the RAP experiment. (K) After the RAP experiment, circBRWD1,
  c-JUN, c-MYC, and CDK6 expression was measured by qPCR, and the qPCR products were
  subjected to nucleic acid gel electrophoresis using a 1% agarose gel. (L–N) Actinomycin
  D (ActD) was added to BEAS-2B-As and control cells stably overexpressing circBRWD1.
  Cell RNA was extracted at different time points (0, 1, 2, and 3 h), and mRNA (c-JUN,
  c-MYC, and CDK6 mRNA) was detected by qPCR. (O) Western blot analysis was performed
  to determine the protein expression of c-JUN, c-MYC, and CDK6 after transient overexpression
  of circBRWD1. An asterisk (∗) indicates a significant difference (p < 0.05).
