caption: 'RR suppresses MCU-dependent ROS generation. (a) Raw264.7 cells were planted
  in a 6-well plate, with or without RANKL and different concentrations of RR stimulation,
  using DCFH-DA probes to show RANKL-induced ROS production, scale bar = 100 μm. (b)
  Quantitative analysis of ROS positive cell number by Image J software. (c) Quantitative
  analysis of DCF relative fluorescence intensity in cells per well. (d) Raw264.7
  cells were stimulated with RANKL and different concentrations of RR, and intracellular
  antioxidant enzyme mRNA levels were shown using qPCR results. (e) With si-MCU or
  empty vector transfection into Raw264.7 cells with the addition of RANKL stimulation,
  DCFH-DA probe showed RANKL-induced ROS production, scale bar = 100 μm. (f) Quantitative
  analysis of ROS positive cell numbers. (g) Quantitative analysis results of DCF
  relative fluorescence intensity in cells per well. (h) Raw264.7 cells were transfected
  with MCU plasmids or empty vectors with the addition of RANKL stimulation, and DCFH-DA
  probe showed total ROS production, scale bar = 100 μm. (i) Quantification of ROS
  positive cell numbers. (j) Quantitative analysis of DCF relative fluorescence intensity
  in cells per well. BF: bright field; DCFH-DA: 2'',7''-dichlorofluorescin diacetate;
  Data was presented as means ± SEM; n = 3; ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗p
  < 0.0001.'
