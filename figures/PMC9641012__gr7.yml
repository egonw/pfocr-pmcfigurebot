caption: Phagocytosis pathway in the Yesso scallop in response to Polydora infection.
  The mRNA and protein expression levels of DEPs involved in phagocytosis are presented
  as means ± standard error (n = 3). Asterisks indicate significant differences (*p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01). Red and green arrows indicate upregulation and downregulation in Polydora-infected
  scallops, respectively. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this
  figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
