caption: EphA2-associated cellular biochemical mechanism of development of CM. (1)
  iRBCs directed signaling through EPCR, ICAM-1, and UNK receptors lead to endothelial
  activation. (2) Release of various pro-inflammatory cytokines (LT-α and TNF-α and
  chemokine (CXCL10 and CCL2). (3) The cytokine LT-α can act on proximal endothelial
  cells to induce upregulation of the receptor EphA2. (4) TNF-α induces upregulation
  of ephrin-A1 ligand, which can be cleaved by metalloproteinases and is released
  into the bloodstream. (5) Chemokines such as CXCL10 and CCL2 recruit circulating
  immune cells, including CD8+ T cells, to the brain to the site of inflammation.
  (7) Ephrin-A1 ligand is then adhered to newly recruited CD8+ T cells and considered
  as ephrin-A1 ligand expressing CD8+ T cells. (7) Upon entry into the brain microvasculature,
  CD8+ T cells expressing the ephrin-A1 ligand bind to the EphA2 receptor expressed
  on brain endothelial cells leading to clustering and activation of EphA2. Forward
  signaling cascades from the EphA2 receptor led to the activation of the NF-κB pathway.
  (8) This results in various downstream consequences, including disruption of endothelial
  cell junctions due to both internalization and shedding of different adherents and
  tight junction protein components. (8) Once brain endothelial cell junctions are
  disrupted, contents of the vasculature can leak into the brain parenchyma. (9) This
  leads to vascular leakage, brain edema, and the development of other neurological
  symptoms associated with P. falciparum infection in CM (Modified diagram of Darling
  et al. 2020) [].
