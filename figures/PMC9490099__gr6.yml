caption: BMDMs deficient in Usp25 show enhanced inflammatory responses to L-arginine.
  (A) Bone marrow of WT mice was irradiated and reconstituted with bone marrow cells
  from either WT mice (WT→WT) or Usp25-/- mice (KO→WT). Mice then were challenged
  with L-arginine to induce pancreatitis. Pancreatic lysates were probed for inflammatory
  pathway activation by immunoblotting. (B) WT and Usp25-/- mice were injected with
  saline or L-arginine. Pancreatic lysates were used for immunoblotting. (C) Messenger
  RNA levels of Ccl4, Ccl5, Cxcl10, and Isg15 in the pancreas of mice. (D) Serum IFNβ
  levels were measured by ELISA. (E) Messenger RNA levels of Ccl4, Ccl5, Cxcl10, and
  Isg15 in the pancreas of WT and Usp25-/- mice. (F) Serum IFNβ levels in mice. (C–F)
  Data are shown as means ± SD; n = 5–6. ∗P < .05 and ∗∗P < .01. GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; p-IRF3, phosphorylated interferon regulatory factor 3; p-P65, phosphorylated
  P65 protein; p-TBK1, phosphorylated TANK binding kinase 1.
