caption: Western blot analysis of the expression of the characteristic proteins of
  neurons derived from SSCs. (A) Western blot bands of Tuj-1, BDNF, CGRP, ChAT, and
  β-actin in control (Left), Nap-E7 (Middle), and Nap-E7-YIGSR groups (Right). (B)
  Expression levels from three replicates per group were quantified, and average levels
  are shown relative to β-actin. The integrin β1/GSK3β/β-Catenin signaling pathway
  was activated in SSCs when cultured on Nap-E7-YIGSR peptide-modified PCL films.
  (C) Western blot bands of integrin β1, GSK3β, p-GSK3β, β-catenin(total), β-catenin(nuclear),
  cyclin D1, and β-actin in control (Left), Nap-E7 (Middle), and Nap-E7-YIGSR groups
  (Right). (D) Expression levels from three replicates per group were quantified,
  and average levels are shown relative to β-actin. (N=3, * p < 0.05).
