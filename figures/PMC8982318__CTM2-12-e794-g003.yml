caption: The p38 MAPK signalling pathway is the downstream signalling pathway of CD155
  in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). (A) RNA‐seq was used for DEGs analysis and volcano
  plot of DEGs is shown (n = 3 in each group). (B) Top 10 enrichment KEGG pathways
  of DEGs. (C) Expressions of Erk1/2, p38, SAPK/JNK and their phosphorylated forms
  in CD155 knockdown and overexpression HCC cells were detected by Western blot (WB)
  assay. (D and E) Expressions of p38 and p‐p38 in CD155 knockdown HCC cells transfected
  with shp38 or treated with SB 203580 (10 μM for 30 min) and CD155 overexpression
  HCC cells treated with anisomycin (5 μM for 30 min) were detected by WB assay. (F)
  Proliferation ability of indicated HCC cells was evaluated by colony formation assay;
  t‐tests were used. (G and H) Migration and invasion abilities of indicated HCC cells
  were evaluated by wound healing and transwell assays; t‐tests were used. Error bars
  represent the SEM from at least three independent experiments. *p < .05; **p < .01;
  ***p < .001
