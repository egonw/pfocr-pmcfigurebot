figure_title: Generation of organoid models
caption: AAdenoviral infection of organoids with a Cre‐GFP expressing recombinase.
  Fluorescence microscopy 24‐h post‐infection (scale bar 100 μm).BSelection of organoids
  based on altered pathway. The RAS‐activated model was selected via EGF removal from
  the normal cultivation medium. The diffuse and WNT‐activated models were enriched
  by depletion of WNT3A and Rspondin (scale bar 25 μm).C–EGenotyping PCRs of infected
  and selected organoid models to document successful recombination. Tp53 R172H/+  in
  the WNT‐activated organoids showed loss of heterozygosity of the wild‐type allele
  after activating the R172H mutation.
