  targets to sensitize cells to tipifarnib treatment
caption: 'A) False discovery rate (FDR) for each gene in the CRISPR library at the
  2 week time point. Top hits are highlighted in red.B) Fold change of gRNA against
  indicated genes in the library after 2 weeks of treatment. Data represented as median
  with range.C) False discovery rate (FDR) for each gene in the CRISPR library at
  the 4 week time point. Top hits are highlighted in red.D) Fold change for gRNA against
  indicated genes in the library after 4 weeks of treatment. Data represented as median
  with range.E) Western blot showing target inhibition of PI3K signaling pathway by
  PI3K-alpha inhibitor alpelisib. Cells were treated for 4 or 24 h at 100, 200 and
  400 nM.F) Western blot showing target inhibition of ERK MAPK pathway by ERK1/2 inhibitor
  SCH772984. Cells were treated for 48 h at 100, 200 and 400 nM.G) Fold change in
  tipifarnib GI50 when combined with indicated concentrations of PI3K-alpha inhibitor
