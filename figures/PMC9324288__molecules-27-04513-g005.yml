caption: 'Friedelin inhibited p-JNK and abrogated scopolamine-induced neuroinflammation
  and neurodegeneration in mice. The immune-blot analysis of neuro-inflammatory markers
  (a) p-JNK, NF-kB, COX-2, caspase-3 and PARP-1 along with histograms of respective
  relative densities is shown at (b)p-JNK (c) NF-kB, (d) COX-2, (e) Caspase-3, (f)
  PARP-1 and β-Actin was used as the loading control. The results were expressed in
  arbitrary units (A.U) and were determined using Image J software and histogram indicate
  mean A.U ± SEM. Significance of control vs. scopolamine is expressed as #, while
  * denotes scopolamine vs. scopolamine + friedelin. * p < 0.05, **, ## p < 0.01 and
  ***, ### p < 0.001.'
