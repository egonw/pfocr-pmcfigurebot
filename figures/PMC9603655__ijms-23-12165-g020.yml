caption: Tentative biodegradation pathway for poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) in aerobic
  conditions. PBS is enzymatically hydrolyzed by extracellular enzymes, namely lipases,
  proteases, and cutinases to monomers 1,4-butanediol and succinic acid. Succinic
  acid is catalytically converted by succinyl-CoA synthetase to succinyl-CoA units,
  which is later metabolized through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to produce
  energy, releasing CO2 and water. Adapted from [].
