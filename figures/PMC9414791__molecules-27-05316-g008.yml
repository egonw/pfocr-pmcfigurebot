caption: 'Protective effect of 80% ethanolic extract from Gimcheon 1ho (GC) cultivar
  walnut (Juglans regia) on HFD-induced mice: (a) ACh level; (b) AChE activity; (c)
  representative western blots for total protein and expression of AChE, ChAT and
  β-actin; (d) protein expression levels of AChE; (e) protein expression levels of
  ChAT. Results shown are mean ± SD (a,b: n = 5, c–e: n = 3). Data are statistically
  represented with * = significantly different from the NC group, and # = significantly
  different from PM group; * and # p < 0.05, ** and ##p < 0.01. Bold line indicates
  mean.'
