caption: MiRNA-mRNA coregulatory network in GBC. (A) Bioinformatics analysis flow
  diagram. (B, C) Heatmap and volcano map of differentially expressed miRNAs between
  GBC and normal gallbladder tissues. (D, E) Heatmap and volcano map of differentially
  expressed mRNAs between GBC and normal gallbladder tissues. (F) MiRNA-mRNA regulatory
  network of GBC. (G) qRT-PCR was performed to measure the level of miRNA in HIBEpiC,
  GBC-SD, or NOZ cells. (H) qRT-PCR was performed to measure the level of mRNA in
  HIBEpiC, GBC-SD, or NOZ cells. (I) Expression of miR-195-5p in GBC tissue and normal
  gallbladder tissue in dataset GSE104165. (J) Expression of FOSL1 in GBC and normal
  gallbladder tissue in dataset GSE74048. (K) Relationship between miR-195-5p expression
  and prognosis in GBC dataset GSE104165. Data are mean ± SD. *P<0.05 compared with
  control group. The experiment was repeated 3 times. miRNA, microRNA; mRNA, messenger
  RNA; GBC, gallbladder cancer; qRT-PCR, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction;
