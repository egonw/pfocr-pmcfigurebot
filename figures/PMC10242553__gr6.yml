caption: Correlation of CD44 expression with immune infiltration level. (A) CD44 is
  significantly associated with tumor purity and is positively correlated with the
  infiltration of different immune cells using the TIMER database. (B) CD44 expression
  has a significant correlation with the infiltration of immune cells in. (C) Scatterplots
  of the correlations between CD44 expression and CD274, CTLA-4, CD47, and CD276 in
  Sarcoma using the GEPIA database.
article_title: CD44 expression is correlated with osteosarcoma cell progression and
  immune infiltration and affects the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
