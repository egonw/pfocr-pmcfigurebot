caption: Senescent fibroblasts promote the migration and invasion of lung cancer cells,
  H1299 and A549. (A). Transwell migration assay of H1299 and A549 cells following
  co-culture with CM from young (p3) and senescent (p7) fibroblasts after 18 h. (B).
  Transwell invasion assay of H1299 and A549 cells following co-culture with CM from
  young (p3) and senescent (p7) fibroblasts after 18 h. Average migration/invasion
  Â±SEM from three independent experiments performed. Statistical analysis; ***, p
