caption: IQGAP3 activates the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, and CDCA5 stimulates
  the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. (a) Gene deletion efficiency of IQGAP3 in T24
  and 5637 cells was examined by RT-qPCR. (b) Western blot analyzed the protein levels
  of EGFR, K-Ras, p-B-Raf, p-MEK, MEK, p-ERK, and ERK in IQGAP3-deficient BCa cells.
  (c) Gene deletion efficiency of CDCA5 in BCa cells was assessed via RT-qPCR. (d)
  The levels of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway-associated proteins in CDCA5-silenced
  BCa cells were analyzed via western blot. ∗∗P < 0.01.
