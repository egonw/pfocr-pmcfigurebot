caption: Effect of increased cofactor NADPH and GTP availability on 2′‐FL production.
  A. Cofactor regeneration pathways associated with the de novo pathway. The genes
  involved in the cofactor engineering include zwf, pntAB, UdhA, Gsk, GuaA, GuaB,
  GuaC, Gmk and Ndk. B. Shake flask fermentation results of different engineered strains
  with single and multiple gene overexpression involving cofactor regeneration. Triplicate
  experiments were conducted, and error bars denote the standard deviation. * and
  ** mean P < 0.05 and P < 0.01 respectively.
