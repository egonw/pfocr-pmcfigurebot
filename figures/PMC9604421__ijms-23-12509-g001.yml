caption: 'Tissue and cellular events in MI. After ischemic exposure, an increase in
  the level of ROS and the lack of ATP lead to cell death and a release of inflammatory
  mediators. During the inflammation stage, the following processes occur: phagocytosis
  of the dead cells’ debris and the formation of new capillaries. At the termination
  stage, some conditions for restoring the integrity of the myocardium by replacing
  dead CMC with fibroblasts and hypertrophy of surviving CMC occur. “Created with
