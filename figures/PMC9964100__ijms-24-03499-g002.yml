caption: Characteristics of CmWRKY8-1. (A) Subcellular localization of CmWRKY8-1 in
  tobacco leaves. mRFP-NLS shows localization of 35S::D53-RFP. GFP shows localization
  of 35S::GFP-CmWRKY8-1. DIC shows epidermal cells. The merged images combine RFP
  with GFP and DIC signals. Bars indicate 20 μm. (B) Yeast validation of CmWRKY8-1
  transcriptional activation activity. The pCL1 and pGBKT7 plasmids were used as positive
  and negative controls, respectively. (C) GLOMAX chemiluminescence determination
  of relative luciferase activity. The different letters mean significant differences
  according to Duncan’s multiple range test at p < 0.05; the same scheme applies below.
  (D) The relative expression of CmWRK8-1 in bud, stem, leaf and root during the nutritional
  growth period. The 2−ΔΔCt method was used to calculate relative transcript abundances.
