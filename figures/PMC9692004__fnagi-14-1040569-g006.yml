caption: 'Effects of activation of Gq pathways in astrocytes on the structure and
  function of synaptic plasticity at postoperative day 11. (A) Golgi staining of the
  CA1 region of the mouse hippocampus (×200, n = 3), Sholl analysis and magnification
  of synapses (×1,000), scale bar = 100 or 20 μm. (B–D) Quantitative analysis of total
  synaptic length, synaptic spine density and synaptic number. (E) Recording and analysis
  of local field potentials in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in response to stimulation
  of Schafer’s lateral branch fibers (n = 3). (F) Average fEPSP Slop in the last 20
  min. *p < 0.05, compared with the AVV-mCherry/CNO group. #p < 0.05, compared with
  the AVV-hM3D/Saline group. Data were expressed as mean ± SD and analyzed by ANOVA
  test with a Tukey post hoc test. The p-values are shown in the picture.'
