caption: Anaerobic electrochemical analysis of the yeast p58C mutants. Bulk electrolysis
  (left) and CV after oxidation (middle) of (a) p58C WT and (b) 6YF. (c) Illustration
  of change in DNA binding associated with redox switching on a multiplex chip (right).
  All scans were performed on 38 Î¼M 4Fe-4S p58C in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl
  and 75 mM NaCl at pH 7.2, with a 100-mV/s scan rate for CV.
