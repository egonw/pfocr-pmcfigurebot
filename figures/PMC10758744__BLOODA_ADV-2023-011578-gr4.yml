caption: Canakinumab suppresses IL-1β, IL-6, and hepcidin levels and inhibits activation
  of immune response, complement pathways, and myeloid differentiation. Pre- and post-treatment
  proteomic data from SomaScan and individual cytokine ELISA revealed key pathways
  that are modulated by canakinumab. (A) Volcano plot of multiplexed proteomic data
  in post-canakinumab patients at month 3 compared with baseline. Highlighted are
  significant proteins from the complement pathway (blue), erythropoiesis pathway
  (orange), and inflammatory pathways (pink) among those with FDR < 0.05. (B-C) Top
  15 GO terms enriched in proteins downregulated (B) and upregulated (C) after canakinumab
  treatment showing FDR and fold enrichment. (D) Canakinumab suppresses key regulators
  of AI, including IL-1β, IL-6, and hepcidin. (E) Canakinumab increases RBC numbers,
  as evidenced by upregulated proteins in RBCs, including AChE and hemoglobin (HBA1
  and HBB). (F) Changes in IL-6 and hemoglobin levels between baseline and month 3.
  Patients treated with canakinumab (blue) have 3.46 times higher odds of having both
  an increase in hemoglobin and a decrease in IL-6 than patients treated with placebo
  (red). (G) Changes in hepcidin and hemoglobin levels between baseline and month
  3. The odds of having both an increase in hemoglobin and a decrease in hepcidin
  were 1.88 times higher in patients treated with canakinumab (light blue) compared
  with placebo (red). AChE, acetylcholinesterase; C1RL, complement component 1, r
  subcomponent-like; C1S, complement component 1, s subcomponent; C3, complement component
  3; C4BPA, complement component 4 binding protein alpha; C9, complement component
  9; CFB, complement factor B; CRIPSLD2, cysteine-rich secretory protein LCCL domain
  containing 2; CST7, cystatin F; FC, fold change; FCN1, ficolin 1; FTH1, ferritin;
