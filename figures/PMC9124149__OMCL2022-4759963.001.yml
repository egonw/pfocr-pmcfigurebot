caption: 'Mitochondrial fission and fusion. Mitochondria are active entities with
  a constant fission and fusion process that mixes their content. Mitochondrial fusion
  results in mitochondria that are elongated and extensively linked. For the fission
  pathway, the main proteins are dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), which governs mitochondrial
  fission in two ways: initially, it is transported from the cytosol to the mitochondrial
  outer membrane (OM); and secondly, its assembly on the mitochondrial surface causes
  restriction of the mitochondria, resulting in the division of one mitochondrion
  into two entities, mitochondrial fission factor (MFF), fission-1 (Fis1), and homologs
  MiD49 and MiD51. Mitofusins 1 and 2 (MFN1/2) at the outer membrane (OM) and opticatrophy1
  (OPA1) at the inner membrane (IM) coordinate mitochondrial fusion, which begins
  with MFN 1/2-mediated OM fusing of two mitochondria and is accompanied by OPA1-directed
  IM fusion.'
