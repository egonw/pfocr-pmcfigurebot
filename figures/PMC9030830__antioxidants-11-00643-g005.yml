caption: 'Rh1 inhibits Ang II-induced increase in the KLF4 promoter activity and phenotypic
  switching of VSMCs via the ERK1/2/p90RSK signaling pathway. (A) After being transfected
  with KLF4-Luc and Renilla-Luc, RASMCs were incubated with 20 µM FMK and/or 50 µM
  Rh1 for 1 h and then treated with Ang II (100 nM) for 12 h. KLF4-Luc promoter activity
  was evaluated after performing normalization with the Renilla luciferase activity.
  (B) The cells were transfected with control plasmid DNA (pcDNA) or dominant negative
  RSK1 (DN-RSK1) for 12 h and then transfected with KLF4-Luc and Renilla-Luc. Next,
  the cells were pretreated with 50 µM Rh1 for 1 h and then treated with Ang II (100
  nM) for 12 h. Subsequently, KLF4-Luc promoter activity was evaluated after performing
  normalization with the Renilla luciferase activity. (C) After the cells were transfected
  with pcDNA or DN-RSK1, they were preincubated with 50 µM Rh1 for 3 h and then treated
  with Ang II (100 nM) for 24 h. (D) The cells were preincubated with 20 µM FMK or
  10 µM U0126 and/or 50 µM Rh1 for 3 h and then stimulated with Ang II (100 nM) for
  24 h. (E) Cells were preincubated with 5 µM LY294002 and/or 50 µM Rh1 for 3 h and
  then exposed to Ang II (100 nM) for 24 h. (C–E) Western blot was used to analyze
  the levels of indicated proteins in the whole-cell lysates. (F–H) RASMCs were preincubated
  with 50 µM Rh1 in the presence or absence of 20 µM FMK or 10 µM U0126 for 1 h, before
  undergoing stimulation with Ang II (100 nM) for 12 h. The mRNA expression levels
  of OPN, vimentin, and α-SMA were evaluated using qPCR analysis. (I) The cell proliferation
  was examined by SRB assay. (A,B,F–I) Results are represented as the mean ± SEM (n
  = 4), * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 compared with the control. # p
  < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, and ### p < 0.001 compared with the Ang II-treated sample.'
