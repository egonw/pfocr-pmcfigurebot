caption: LINC00092 overexpression inhibited BC growth in vivo. In vivo BC mouse model
  was established with mock or LINC00092 transfection. (a, b) Body weights and tumor
  volumes of mice in the mock and LINC00092 group were measured at day 3, day 7, day
  14, day 21, and day 28. (c) The visual picture of mice with subcutaneous BC transplantation.
  (d) The visual picture of tumor tissues and tumor weights was detected. (e) HE staining
  was carried out to observe the microstructure changes of tumor tissues, and IHC
  assay was utilized to detect the Ki-67 expression in tumor tissues. N = 6. N.S.P
  > 0.05; ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
