caption: In adipocytes, Isthmin‐1 (ISM1) increases glucose uptake by activating the
  phosphoinositide 3‐kinase (PI3K)–protein kinase B (AKT) pathway in a similar manner
  as insulin does. An unknown receptor tyrosine kinase distinct from the insulin receptors
  and insulin‐like growth factor 1 (IGF‐1) appears to be involved. In hepatocytes,
  ISM1 stimulates protein synthesis and suppresses lipogenesis, whereas insulin stimulates
  both.
