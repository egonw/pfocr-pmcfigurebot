figure_title: Molecular (auto‐)regulation of CD142+ ASPC (Areg)'s inhibitory activity
caption: 'ARepresentative fluorescence microscopy images of CD142− ASPCs, co‐cultured
  with CD142+ ASPCs (Aregs) carrying control (scrambled (scr)) or siRNA‐mediated knockdowns
  of selected CD142+ ASPC (Areg)‐specific candidate genes: F3, Mgp and Gdf10 after
  adipogenic differentiation (i.e., after exposure to an adipogenic cocktail, ).BFraction
  of differentiated CD142− ASPCs, as quantified by the “adiposcore”, co‐cultured with
  CD142+ ASPCs (Aregs) subjected to specific knockdowns (or scr siRNA control), as
  indicated in (A); marker shapes correspond to different biological replicates, n = 10,
  4 biological replicates, 2–3 independent wells for each.CPCA based on bulk RNA‐seq
  data of CD142− ASPCs co‐cultured with CD142+ ASPCs (Aregs) subjected to specific
  knockdowns as indicated in (A); see colour legend at the bottom of the figure.DExpression
  heatmap of top CD142+ markers (i.e., Areg markers, Appendix Table ) with a positive
  log2FC when performing differential expression analysis between CD142− ASPCs that
  were exposed to “active Aregs” (WT, scr, siGdf10) versus CD142− ASPCs that were
  exposed to “dysfunctional Aregs” (siF3, siMgp) across the bulk RNA‐seq of the same
  samples and of CD142− and CD142+ ASPCs after exposure to an adipogenic cocktail;
  genes are ordered from the highest (top) to the lowest (bottom) log2FC; significantly
  differentially expressed genes (FDR < 0.05) are coloured in blue; Areg candidates
  are highlighted in bold; log normalised expression scaled by row; see colour legend
  at the bottom of the figure.EHeatmap showing the Euclidian distance of the transcriptomic
  data of CD142− ASPCs co‐cultured (via transwell) with distinct CD142+ ASPC knockdown
  types or controls as well as CD142+ or CD142− ASPCs post‐differentiation, calculated
  on the five first principal components of the PCA shown in Appendix Fig D.FCorrelation
  of “white fat cell differentiation score” versus “CD142+ score”; see colour legend
  at the bottom of the figure.GVolcano plot showing the coefficient of the linear
  regression performed between “white fat cell differentiation score” (WFCDS) and
  log normalised gene expression (WFCDS ~ log(normalised expression)) (x‐axis) versus
  the −log10(P‐value) (y‐axis); top CD142+ markers (i.e., Areg markers, Appendix Table )
  are highlighted in blue and genes linked to “cellular response to RA” (GO:0071300)
  and “RA receptor signalling pathway” (GO:0048384) terms in green. Data information:
  In all images, nuclei are stained with Hoechst (blue) and lipids are stained with
  Bodipy (yellow); scale bars, 100 μm. *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001, pairwise
  two‐sided t‐test (B), for statistical details see .'
