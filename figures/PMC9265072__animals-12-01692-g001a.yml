caption: The effects of Chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) at different concentrations
  (0, 100, 150, 200, 400 and 800 μg/mL) on the viability, proliferation and cycle
  distribution of bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs) were observed after they
  were treated for 24, 36 and 48 h respectively. (A) CCK8 reagent was used to detect
  the BMECs viability at 450 nm. The Y-axis showed the percentage of cell survival,
  and the X-axis showed the doses of COS. (B) The proliferation of BMECs after COS
  treatment was measured by the Edu cell proliferation detection kit, the scale bar
  stands 200 μm. DAPI (blue), EdU (red). (C) the percentage of Edu positive cells
  in the total number of cells. (D) under COS culture at different concentrations,
  the BMECs cycle distribution was detected by flow cytometry. Y-axis represents the
  cell count analyzed, while X-axis indicates the DNA content of PI- stained cells.
  (E) The percentage of cells distributed in different stages of cell cycles (G1 phase,
  S phase and G2 phase) is represented by a histogram. Data were the mean ± SE from
  three independent experiments. Different small letters showed significant difference
  (p < 0.05), different capital letters showed extremely significant difference (p
  < 0.01), and the same letters or unmarked letters had no significant difference.
