figure_title: Activation of the ISR pathway
caption: In response to various cellular stress stimuli eIF2α kinase molecules are
  activated through dimerisation. eIF2α kinases phosphorylate the α subunit of eIF2.
  In its phosphorylated form, eIF2 is a competitive inhibitor of eIF2B activity preventing
  replenishment of eIF2-GTP within the cell. This leads to inhibition of global protein
  synthesis while the translation of specific stress response mRNAs, including ATF4,
  is up-regulated. During episodes of acute ISR, ISR effectors are able to restore
  homeostasis and ATF4-mediated activation of CHOP induces the transcription of GADD34
  to promote dephosphorylation of eIF2α. In cases where ISR effectors are unable to
  restore homeostasis, the cell transitions into a chronically activated ISR. Protein
  synthesis is restored via an eIF2B independent mechanism and ATF4-mediated activation
  of CHOP promotes proapoptotic gene expression.
