caption: 'The therapeutic pathway and the peroxynitrite/oxidative stress/inflammation
  pathway each inhibit the action of the other via multiple mechanisms. Pathways taken
  from Fig. (). How almost opposite effects can be produced by EMFs. Fig. (A) shows
  the two pathways without any inhibitory influences shown. Fig. (B) shows multiple
  mechanisms by which raised Nrf2 in the therapeutic pathway inhibits multiple steps
  in the peroxynitrite pathway, including the following [, ]: 1.Raising Nrf2 raises
  the levels of both mitochondrial and cytoplasmic superoxide dismutases, lowering
  superoxide levels. 2. Raising Nrf2 raised the levels of redoxyredoxin-1 and -6,
  both of which scavenge peroxynitrite. 3. Raising the level of Nrf2 raises each of
  the two enzymes the synthesize reduced glutathione (GSH), raises the levels of glutathione
  reductase which is needed to reduce oxidized glutathione back to GSH, raises the
  levels of all 8 enzymes required to make the reductant for glutathione reductase,
  NADPH and raising Nrf2 raises the levels of the two glutathione peroxidases which
  used GSH to produce antioxidant effects. In summary, raising Nrf2 raises GSH-dependent
  antioxidant effects in a highly coordinated fashion by raising the levels of 13
  different enzymes. 4. Raising Nrf2 lowers the levels of NF-kappaB, therefore lowering
  diverse inflammatory responses. Fig. (C) shows how multiple intermediates in the
  peroxynitrite pathway inhibit multiple steps in the therapeutic NO signaling pathway
  (pp. 22291-22292 in []).: 1. Raised oxidant levels in oxidative stress oxidizes
  the heme FeII iron in the sGC, labilizing the heme group which detaches from the
  protein, producing an enzymatically inactive protein. 2. A specific cysteine thiol
  group in sGC becomes oxidized to a thiyl group which becomes nitrosylated, producing
  an enzymatically inactive protein. 3. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) prevents the formation
  of the thiyl group (immediately above) but BH4 is oxidized by ONOO(-) [], lowering
  this preventive activity. 4. Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) which hydrolyzes cGMP is
  produced in much greater amounts because of oxidative stress, thus lowering cGMP
  levels. 5. The G-kinase undergoes peroxynitrite-dependent tyrosine nitration, inactivating
  the G-kinase enzymatic activity. 6. An additional mechanism by which ONOO(-) lowers
  NO signaling, not diagrammed in Fig. (). involving BH4 oxidation by ONOO(-) is that
  BH4 is a required cofactor for the nitric oxide synthases such that when the BH4
  is oxidized, the NO synthases become uncoupled, synthesizing superoxide instead
  of nitric oxide []; BH4 depletion occurs in AD neurons [].'
