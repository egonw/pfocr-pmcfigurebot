caption: 'AU and CU could protect intestinal barrier function by activating LPR6.
  (A) Drug selection targeting the LRP6 pathway. (B) Intestinal barrier permeability
  of mice after treatment by DSS and DSS plus oral administration of AU and CU (n=6).
  (C) Colon length of mice after treatment by DSS with or without AU and CU (n=6).
  (D) Colon claudin2 mRNA of mice after treatment of DSS with or without AU and CU
  (n=6). (E) Colon occludin mRNA of mice after treatment by DSS with or without AU
  and CU (n=6). (F) Colon ZO-1 mRNA of mice after treatment by DSS with or without
  AU and CU (n=6). (G) claudin2, occludin and ZO-1 expression of mice colon after
  treatment by DSS with or without AU and CU (n=3). Throughout, error bars represent
  the mean ± s.e.m. * vs WT, *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; n.s., not significant; by Student''s
  t-test. LRP6: low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6; AT: AT-7519; CU;
  curcumin; SN: SN-38; AU: auranofin; AM: amsacrine; and EM: emetine.'
