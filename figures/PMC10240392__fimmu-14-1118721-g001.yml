caption: Knockout of TLRs suppresses tumor promoting effect of NTHi-induced COPD-like
  airway inflammation on K-ras driven lung cancer. Lung surface tumor number (n=9-14)
  (A) and tumor area (n=4-5) (B). Representative photomicrographs of whole slide images
  of lung hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections in CC-LR+NTHi, CC-LR/TLR2KO+NTHi,
  CC-LR/TLR4KO+NTHi, and CC-LR/TLR9KO+NTHi at 14 weeks of age, black arrows depict
  lung microtumors (C). Data represent mean ± SEM; experimental groups are separately
  compared to CC-LR cohort, where *p< 0.05 by unpaired t-test.
article_title: Toll-like receptors 2, 4, and 9 modulate promoting effect of COPD-like
  airway inflammation on K-ras-driven lung cancer through activation of the MyD88/NF-ĸB
  pathway in the airway epithelium.
