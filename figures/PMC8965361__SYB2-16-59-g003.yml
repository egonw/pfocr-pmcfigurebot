caption: Correlation and functional enrichment analysis of m 6 A RNA methylation regulators
  in gastrointestinal carcinoma. (a) Spearman correlation analysis of the 13 m6A modification
  regulators. Colour dots represent the Pearson correlation coefficient. (b) Functional
  annotation of the genes using the Gene Ontology (GO) terms of Biological Processes
  (BP). (c) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) analysis of the genes in high‐risk
  groups for the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway. (d) GSEA
  analysis of the genes in high‐risk groups was enriched for hallmarks of malignant
  tumours. GO, Gene Ontology; GSEA, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
article_title: Construction and validation of m6A RNA methylation regulators associated
  prognostic model for gastrointestinal cancer.
