figure_title: The cordycepin pathway promotes stemness maintenance in MSCs and prevents
  aging. The graphic provides a concise explanation of the signaling mechanisms through
  which cordycepin activates SIRT1 for stemness maintenance and anti-aging in MSCs.
  The arrows represent stimulation, and the whiskered lines represent inhibition
