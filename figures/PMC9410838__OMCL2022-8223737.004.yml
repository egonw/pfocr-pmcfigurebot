caption: MT can reduce the ferroptosis level in BMSCs induced by DEX. (a) ROS staining
  was performed to test the correlation between different concentrations of MT and
  the level of oxidative stress. (b) Quantitative analysis of the number of ROS-positive
  cells per field in (a). (c) Annexin V-mCherry/SYTOX Green detection kit was used
  to detect cell death. (d) Quantitative analysis of the percentage of SYTOX green-positive
  cells in (c). (e–i) Western blot and qRT-PCR results for the expressions of system
  xc-, ACSL4, GPX4, and FSP1 were pretreated with various concentrations of MT for
  24 h; DEX (10−3 M) was then added for 24 h. These studies were performed at least
  3 biological replicates. Data represent mean ± SD (n = 3). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗P < 0.005 compared with DEX group.
