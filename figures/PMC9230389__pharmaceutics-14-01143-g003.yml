caption: MAPK pathway activation in response to treatment with cisplatin combined
  with ChoKα inhibitors. H460 human NSCLC cells were exposed to cisplatin, ChoKα inhibitors,
  or both treatments following a sequential schedule and showing a synergistic effect
  (cisplatin followed by ChoKα inhibitors). p-JNK (A) and p-p38 (B) levels were analyzed
  by Western blotting at different timepoints. Tubulin or total p38 protein were used
  to normalize. Results are the means of three independent experiments. Western blots
  are representative of one single experiment.
