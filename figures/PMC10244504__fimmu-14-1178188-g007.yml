caption: Results of network pharmacology analysis. (A) Cognitive dysfunction targets
  and neuroinflammation targets were obtained from the GeneCards database, and chlorogenic
  acid targets were obtained from the TCMSP database, Swiss target prediction database
  and QSAR database. A total of 117 targets were obtained after intersection of the
  Venn diagram. (B) PPI was constructed using 117 targets based on the degree values.
  (C) GO enrichment analysis of 20 targets. (D) KEGG pathway analysis of 20 targets.
  (E) Schematic diagram of TNF signaling pathway.
