caption: CTSC overexpression promotes cell migration and invasion in vitro. A. Wound-healing
  assay in CTSC overexpression and mock cells. Scale bar, 100 μm. Data are presented
  as the means ± standard deviation and are analyzed using Student’s t-test (n = 3).
  Scale bar, 20 μm. B, C. Transwell migration and invasion assays. The number of cells
  in five randomly chosen fields is counted. Data are presented as the means ± standard
  deviation and are evaluated using Student’s t-test (n = 3). Scale bar, 200 μm. D.
  Western blot analysis showing lower expression of epithelial markers (E-cad and
  Ep-CAM) and TIMP2 and higher expression of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vimentin,
  and Slug), MMP2, and MMP9 in CTSC-overexpressing cells than in mock cells. E. AKT,
  ERK, FAK, and YAP expression levels are determined by western blot analysis in cells
  with CTSC overexpression. ***P < 0.001.
