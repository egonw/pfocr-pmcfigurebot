caption: 'Immune infiltration, methylation, and drug sensitivity of ARL4C genes in
  KIRC and pan-cancers. (a) Correlation analysis between ARL mRNA expression and GDSC
  drug sensitivity. Red and blue colors indicate that gene expression was positively
  or negatively correlated, respectively, with drug sensitivity. The darker the color,
  the higher the correlation. (b) Methylation of ARL genes in different tumor types.
  Red indicates hypermethylation of the gene in the tumor, and the darker the color,
  the higher the methylation; blue indicates hypomethylation in the tumor, and the
  darker the color, the more pronounced the inhibition of methylation. (c) Correlation
  between different immune cells and ARL gene expression in KIRC patients. Blue represents
  an increase in immune infiltration with increasing gene expression, whereas red
  indicates that the correlation was negative. The darker the color, the higher the
  correlation. (d) Heat map showing the correlation of ARL gene expression with the
  infiltration of various immune cells in different types of pathological tumors.
