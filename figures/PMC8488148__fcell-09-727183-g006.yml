caption: Gene set and function enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes
  between the high-risk group and low-risk group. (A) TGF-Î² signaling pathway, terpenoid
  backbone biosynthesis, pyruvate metabolism, cell cycle, and ERBB signaling pathway
  are enriched in the high-risk group. (B) TNFs bind their physiological receptors,
  TNF receptor superfamily TNFSF members mediating non-canonical NF-kB pathway, pyroptosis
  pathway, chemokine receptors bind chemokines pathway, antigen processing and presentation
  pathway, and NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity pathway are enriched in the low-risk
  group.
