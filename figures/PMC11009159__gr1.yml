caption: 'γ-H2AX immunostaining and comet assays on nuclei of MCs from Xoo-infected
  rice leaves.(A) γ-H2AX immunostaining and comet assays with MC nuclei from the ku70
  and atm-1 mutants and their WTs (DJ and GLA4) after ZJ173 infection. Scale bars:
  20 μm in comet assay and 10 μm in γ-H2AX immunostaining. Leaves of 4-week-old seedlings
  were collected under control conditions or after a 48-h ZJ173 treatment.(B) Comet
  assay with MC nuclei from DJ plants under control conditions or after 48 h of DC3000
  treatment. DC3000 is a pathogenic bacterium of Arabidopsis. Scale bars: 20 μm.(C)
  Quantification of the comet and γ-H2AX signals in (A).Data are means ± SD (n = 3).
  ∗∗, significant difference compared with WTs, P < 0.05 as calculated by one-way
  ANOVA.'
