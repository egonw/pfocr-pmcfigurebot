caption: 'Akt signaling pathway mediates the pro-apoptosis role Crtc1 in ALI. (A-D)
  Western blot (A) and quantification (B-D) showing the role of Crtc1 gene manipulation
  on p-Akt/Akt. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 vs. Crtc1+/+; #P < 0.05, ###P < 0.001 vs. Sham;
  n = 3. (E, F) Representative TUNEL staining images (E) and quantification (F) showed
  Triciribine (10µM) blocked the inhibition of Crtc1 knockdown on LPS-induced TUNEL-positive
  cells. **P < 0.01 vs. LPS group; #P < 0.05 vs. siCrtc1 + LPS group; n = 3. (G-J)
  Western blot (G) and quantification (H-J) showing Triciribine reversed the protective
  effects of Crtc1 silencing on apoptosis-associated proteins, such as Cleaved-caspase3/Caspase3
  (H), Bcl-2 (I) and Bax (J) in RAW264.7 cells. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001
  vs. LPS group; #P < 0.05 vs. siCrtc1 + LPS group; n = 3. (K-N) Triciribine blocked
  the inhibition of Crtc1 knockdown on LPS-induced inflammation factors including
  TNF-α (K), IL-1β (L), IL-6 (M) and CXCL1 (N). *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001 vs. LPS group;
  #P < 0.05 vs. siCrtc1 + LPS group; n = 6'
