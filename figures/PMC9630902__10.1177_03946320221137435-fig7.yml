caption: Photomicrograph of the hepatic tissue section. Figures (a and b) representing
  control and Lut/ZnO NPs showed a normal histological structure of the liver. However,
  Figure (c) (HFD) showed centrilobular coagulative necrosis of hepatocytes arrow.
  Figure (d) (HFD+ STZ) showed disorganization of hepatic cords, fatty degeneration,
  and necrosis of hepatocytes arrow. Lut/ZnO NPs treatment exhibited moderate hepatocytes
  swelling arrow (Figure (e)) and few numbers of intracellular microvesicular steatosis
  arrow (Figure (f)) representing the HFD+ Lut/ZnO NPs and HFD+ STZ+ Lut/ZnO NPs respectively
  (H&Ex200).
