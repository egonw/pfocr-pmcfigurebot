caption: 'Single-cell and bulk analysis in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)
  cells of functional parameters reveals maintenance of phospho-signature at relapse
  in 4 of 5 T-ALL patients. (A) Vaevictis dimensionality reduction was applied on
  T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells obtained from 5 pediatric T-ALL
  patients at diagnosis and relapse (top row). Signaling, proliferation and internal
  regulators (PTEN, MYC, BCL-2, p-4E-BP1, p-STAT5, p-AKT, p-p38, p-S6, p-LCK, p-CREB,
  p-RB, Ki-67, p-ERK1/2) were considered for the projection calculation. Two to 4
  subsets of T-ALL cells were identified in each diagnostic sample. The same gating
  strategy was applied on the paired relapse samples. Histograms show phosphorylation
  of RB (middle row) and 4E-BP1 (bottom row) of particular subsets of T-ALL cells.
  The color of the histogram line corresponds with the color of the gate in the Vaevictis
  projection. The y-axis reflects the count of the cells. The redistribution of particular
  subsets from diagnosis to relapse is visualized using fish plot. The color of each
  subset corresponds with the color of the gate in the Vaevicts projection. Time points
  (diagnosis, relapse) are indicated on x-axis, percentage of particular cell subset
  is reflected on y-axis. (B) Heatmap represents fold change in protein phosphorylation
  in ex vivo IL-7 stimulated cells compared to unstimulated state, samples were obtained
  from T-ALL patients (in columns) at diagnosis (black label) or relapse (orange label).
  Only T-ALL cells from the diagnostic samples are included in the analysis. Paired
  diagnostic and relapse samples are connected. Heat in squares represents the fold
  change in phosphorylation of proteins listed in rows. Hierarchical clustering with
  Euclidean distance metrics and an average linkage dissects two clusters of T-ALL
  samples (separated with horizontal line): IL-7 responder and IL-7 non-responder.
  (C) Heatmap represents fold change in protein phosphorylation of PI3K pathway members
  in ex vivo BEZ-235 stimulated cells compared to unstimulated state, samples were
  obtained from T-ALL patients (in columns) at diagnosis (black label) or relapse
  (orange label). Only T-ALL cells from the diagnostic samples are included in the
  analysis. Paired diagnostic and relapse samples are connected. Heat in squares represents
  the fold change in phosphorylation of proteins listed in rows. Hierarchical clustering
  with Euclidean distance metrics and an average linkage was used. The 2 clusters
  of samples (separated with horizontal line) were dissected manually according to
  : BEZ-235 responder and BEZ-235 non-responder.'

  pathways dominates the single-cell phosphosignature of ex vivo treated pediatric
  T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells.
