caption: Establishment of the signature based on tyrosine metabolism-related genes.
  (a) Partial likelihood deviance of different numbers of variables; (b) the LASSO
  coefficient profiles of the selected four features; (c) the heatmap plot showed
  the distribution of four selected genes between different clinicopathological features;
  (d) the Kaplanâ€“Meier plot and log-rank analysis showed the survival outcome difference
  between low- and high-risk subgroups in the TCGA training cohort; (e) the ROC curve
  showed the predictive value of the four gene-based signatures in the training cohort;
  (f) the Kaplan-Meier plot and logrank analysis showed the survival outcome difference
  between low- and high-risk subgroups in the TCGA validation cohort; (g) the ROC
  curve showed the predictive value of the four gene-based signatures in the validation
  cohort.
