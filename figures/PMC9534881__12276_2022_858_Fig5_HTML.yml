figure_title: Increased ERK1/2 signaling activity abolishes the FSH-induced inhibitory
  effects on various endometrial stem cell functions
caption: A schematic summary of the role of the FAK/ERK1/2 signaling pathway in mediating
  FSH-induced inhibitory effects on endometrial stem cells is described (a). Endometrial
  stem cells were prestimulated with the ERK1/2 activator ceramide C6 (10 µM) for
  1 h prior to FSH (30 IU/ml) treatment for 48 h. The FSH-induced effects on cell
  growth were then analyzed by MTT assays (b). The attenuating effects of the ERK1/2
  activator C6 (10 µM) on the FSH-induced effects on migration ability were measured
  by Transwell assays (c) and western blotting for the cell migration regulators MMP-2
  and MMP-9 (d). Endometrial stem cells were prestimulated with the ERK1/2 activator
  ceramide C6 (10 µM) for 1 h prior to an additional FSH (30 IU/ml) treatment for
  48 h. Subsequent effects on the adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation capacity
  were analyzed by oil red O staining and alizarin red S staining, respectively. Relative
  quantification of calcium deposition and lipid droplet (LD) secretion from differentiating
  cells was performed by measuring the absorbance of solubilized cells at 500 nm and
  570 nm, respectively (e). β-Actin was used as an internal control. All experiments
  were performed in triplicate. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation
  (SD). *p < 0.05; **p < 0.005; and ***p < 0.001 (two-sample t test).
