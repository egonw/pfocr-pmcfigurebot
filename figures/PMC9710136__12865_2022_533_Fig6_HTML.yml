caption: DDX1-related gene enrichment analysis and GSEA analysis. A STRING website
  was used to extract the top 50 DDX1-binding proteins which were supported by available
  experiments. B Intersection analysis of DDX1-binding and correlated genes. C–E Using
  the GEPIA approach, we obtained the top 100 DDX1-correlated genes in TCGA and analyzed
  the expression correlation between DDX1 and selected targets, including HNRNPU,
  TARDBP, HNRNPK F Pathways in cancer, G cell cycle, H DNA replication, I Wnt signaling
  pathway, J MAPK signaling pathway, and K TGF-β signaling pathway
article_title: DDX1 is a prognostic biomarker and correlates with immune infiltrations
  in hepatocellular carcinoma.
