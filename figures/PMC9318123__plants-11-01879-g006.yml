caption: Co-expression network of transcripts related to the synthesis pathway of
  triterpenes and members of the cytochrome P450 family in leaves of the galphimine
  producer plants and non-galphimine producer plants. Transcripts are represented
  by spheres and dotted lines are their interaction. HMGCR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
  reductase), DXS (1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase), CDP-ME (4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
  kinase), HMB-PPS (4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate synthase), IPP isomerase
  (isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase), GPPS (geranyl diphosphate synthase), FT (farnesyl
  transferase), TS (terpene synthase), SS (squalene synthase), SE (squalene epoxidase),
  BAS (beta-amyrin synthase), LS (lanosterol synthase).
