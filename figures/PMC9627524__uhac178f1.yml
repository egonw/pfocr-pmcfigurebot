caption: 'Pyrethrin biosynthesis gene expression and pyrethrin content in Tanacetum
  cinerariifolium leaves in response to short-term MeJA treatment. a Pyrethrin biosynthesis
  pathway. Heatmaps indicate the gene expression profile at different time points
  after MeJA treatment. Different colours represent the log10 FPKM value. Solid arrows
  indicate known steps in the pathway. Dotted arrows indicate steps not yet elucidated.
  The solid box encloses the six major pyrethrins. Abbreviations: ADH2, alcohol dehydrogenase2;
  ALDH, aldehyde dehydrogenase; CHH, chrysanthemol 10-hydroxylase; CHS, chrysanthemol
  synthase; GLIP, GDSL lipase-like protein; JMH, jasmolone hydroxylase; MT, 10-carboxychrysanthemic
  acid 10-methyltransferase; PYS, pyrethrolone synthase. b qRT-PCR analysis of pyrethrin
  biosynthesis genes. Blue bars are the fold change in average fragments per kilobase
  of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM). Green bars are the qRT-PCR results
  normalized with the 2−△△Ct method using GADPH as an internal reference. The experiment
  was performed three times with three biological replicates. Error bars represent
  mean ± SD. c GC–MS chromatograms of leaves treated for 0, 6, 12, and 24 h. The relative
  pyrethrin content was determined using tetradecane as an internal standard, with
  three biological replicates. d Relative contents of total pyrethrins. The y-axis
  represents peak area intensity. Error bars represent the SD of the mean of three
  replicates. Different lower-case letters indicate a significant difference (P < 0.05)
  from one-way ANOVA followed by a post-hoc Tukey test.'
