caption: 'Upregulation of Gal-3 in blood and AVs of CAVD patients. (A) Serum Gal-3
  concentration in CAVD and control subjects (n=20); (B) mRNA expression levels of
  Gal-3 in AVs from CAVD patients and control subjects (n=4); (C) quantification of
  western blot; (D) protein expression levels of Gal-3 in AVs from CAVD patients and
  control subjects (n=5); (E) representative pictures of AV sections immunostained
  for Gal-3 and ALP observed at low (×5, scale bar: 1 mm) and high (×20, scale bar:
  100 µm) magnification in controls and CAVD patients. Statistical comparisons were
  made using Student’s t-test. All of the data are presented as mean ± SEM. *, P<0.05,
  **, P<0.01. Gal-3, galectin-3; AVs, aortic valves; CAVD, calcific aortic valve disease.'

  cells via the NF-kappa B signaling pathway.
