caption: The ERK1/2, AKT and STAT3 signaling pathways influence the effects of 5-DMN
  on cell apoptosis, cycle and apoptosis-related proteins. (A) The apoptotic rate
  of U87-MG cells was determined using Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining after 5-DMN
  treatment with or without inhibitor. (B) Western blotting detected cell cycle proteins
  and apoptosis-related proteins levels in 5-DMN-treated U87-MG cells with or without
  pathway inhibitors. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 vs. cells in the control group.
