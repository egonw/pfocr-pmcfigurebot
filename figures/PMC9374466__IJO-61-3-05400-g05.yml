caption: CASC11 suppresses p53 signaling in prostate cancer cells by binding with
  YBX1. (A) Heat map displaying differentially expressed genes in sh-CASC11 groups
  and sh-NC groups by RNA sequencing. (B) Protein expression levels of p53 and p21
  were measured by western blotting when CASC11 was knocked down in LNCaP and 22Rv1
  cells. (C) SDS-PAGE gel stained with silver to show separated proteins. (D and E)
  Using the YBX1 or IgG antibody, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was used
  to examine RNA enrichment in RIP assay. (F and G) Protein expression levels of YBX1
  were measured by western blotting when CASC11 was knocked down or overexpressed
  in LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 vs. sh-NC or vector, or
  as indicated. CASC11, cancer susceptibility candidate 11; NC, negative control;
  ns, not significant; OE-CASC11, CASC11 overexpression plasmid; RIP, RNA immunoprecipitation;
  sh, short hairpin.
