caption: Levels of sterols in post-lanosterol synthesis pathway in serum (A), liver
  (B), and spleen (C). VEH injection (circles), ARI+TRZ exposure (squares), males
  (blue), and females (red). Two-tailed unpaired t-tests were used to determine significance.
  Only sterols that exhibit a significant difference in concentration are shown; the
  levels of all sterols are presented in .
