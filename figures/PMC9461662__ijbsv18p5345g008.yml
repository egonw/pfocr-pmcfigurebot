caption: Exposure to MSC-EV causes the generation of Ca2+ oscillations in hippocampal
  astrocytes. The role of vesicular ATP secretion. (A, B) Hippocampal cell culture
  on the 14th day of cultivation loaded with a calcium-sensitive probe Fura-2 with
  recording of transmitted light (A) and of the signal in the 380 nm channel (B).
  (C) Ca2+ responses of hippocampal neurons to a short-term addition of 35 mM KCl
  and demonstrating the absence of signals in response to the addition of MSC-EV at
  a concentration of 2.4×108 particles/mL. The red curve represents the cumulative
  signal from neurons undergoing spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations while the black curve
  is a cumulative signal from the population of neurons without spontaneous activity.
  The averaged signals from several dozen neurons for each curve are presented. (D)
  Ca2+ signals from hippocampal astrocytes in response to a short-term addition of
  10 µM ATP and MSC-EV at a concentration of 2.4×108 particles/mL. The averaged Ca2+
  signals obtained from various astrocyte populations are presented. Ca2+ oscillations
  followed by a rise of [Ca2+]i stationary level were reсorded in 14% of astrocytes
  (green curve). In 56% of astrocytes, Ca2+ oscillations occured without changing
  the basal level of [Ca2+]i (red curve). Finally, in 30% of astrocytes, [Ca2+]i did
  not respond to the MSC-EV exposure (black curve). The number of astrocytes corresponding
  to each mode of Ca2+ oscillations is indicated as a percentage. (E) MSC-EV-induced
  Ca2+ oscillations of hippocampal astrocytes are not suppressed by the application
  of 35 units per ml of the ATP-degrading enzyme apyrase and 1 µM of Bafilomycin A1
  (BafA1), an inhibitor of V-ATPase. (F) Pre-incubation of hippocampal astrocytes
  with apyrase and BafA1 did not prevent the generation of Ca2+ oscillations caused
  by MSC-EV. Responses of individual astrocytes are presented in panels (E) and (F).
  Representative Ca2+ signals typical for most cells in culture are shown. The experiments
  were performed in the 4 technical replicates per 3 independent cell cultures.
