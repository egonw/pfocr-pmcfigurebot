caption: Pathway bottlenecking‐and‐debottlenecking strategy in this study. This pathway
  engineering strategy comprises three stages. Design the artificial naringenin pathway
  bottleneck by expressing the individual naringenin gene into the low‐copy plasmid
  with the weak promoter (stage 1). Eliminate the de‐novo bottleneck of the naringenin
  pathway by screening the candidate mutants, which produce a similar naringenin production
  to that of the original pathway (stage 2). Put mutants of the individual genes back
  into the original pathway and further balance the metabolic flux by artificial‐intelligence‐mediated
  promoter engineering (stage 3).
