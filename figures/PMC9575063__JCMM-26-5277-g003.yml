caption: 'Inhibition of the AMPK signalling pathway reverses the effect of NANOG knockdown
  on EMT. SKOV‐3 and A2780 cells were transfected with siRNA against NANOG for 48 h
  followed by treatment with 20 μM compound C for 24 h. (A) Protein expression of
  pAMPKα, AMPKα, pmTOR, mTOR, pp70S6K, p70S6K and α‐actinin was analysed by western
  blot (numbers below each blot are densitometric values). (B, C) Cell migration and
  invasion assays were conducted using a Boyden chamber assay. Upper panel: representative
  image of a Boyden chamber assay. Lower panel: quantitative result of a Boyden chamber
  assay. (D) Protein expression of NANOG, ZEB1, vimentin, N‐cadherin and α‐actinin
  was analysed by Western blot (numbers below each blot are densitometric values).
  Error bars represent the mean ± standard error (S.E) of triplicate experiments.'
