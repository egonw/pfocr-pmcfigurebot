caption: Integrated metabolomics pathway diagram of rumen fluid and serum from Jersey
  steers. The figure combines significantly different metabolic pathways of rumen
  fluid and serum under moderate temperature period (MTP) and high temperature period
  (HTP) conditions. The differentially expressed metabolites are illustrated by red
  or green boxes, which means up-regulated (red box) and down-regulated (green box)
  metabolite in HTP based on P-value (n = 8/group), respectively.
