caption: DNA methylation profile of genes revealed by Bwa-meth, BSMAP, Bismark-bwt2-e2e
  and Walt. (a) SOX9 gene was the highest differentially expressed genes between control
  and schizophrenia in humans (43). (b) MPZ gene was the hub gene related to Wnt signaling
  pathway of embryonic processes in cattle (44). (c) IGF2BP3 was the key gene that
  regulated the development of skeletal muscle in pigs (45).
