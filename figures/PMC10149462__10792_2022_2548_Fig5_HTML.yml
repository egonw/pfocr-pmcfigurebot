caption: ZD6474 attenuated trans-differentiation to myofibroblasts in TGF-β1-induced
  HTFs. a Immunofluorescence was performed to detect vimentin (green) expression.
  The nuclei (blue) were labeled with DAPI. Scale bar, 200 μm. b Protein levels of
  snail and α-SMA in TGF-β1-induced HTFs were analyzed by western blot analysis and
  normalized to GAPDH expression

  and inhibits neovascularization via AKT-mTOR signaling pathway.
