caption: Changing glycerophospholipid metabolism during manipulation primarily indicate
  altered acetylcholine levels in the ant and cell membrane metabolism in the fungus.
  Manipulated ant samples appeared to have two distinct groups, one with high acetylcholine
  and one with levels similar to healthy ants. In manipulated ants, the putative acetylcholinesterase
  and two acetylcholine receptor genes were downregulated, suggesting acetylcholine
  levels were accumulating. We hypothesize that increased acetylcholine in manipulated
  ants is associated with the increased muscular activity during early manipulation
  (e.g., tremors, biting, and latching behavior). Once the ant is secured in a summited
  position and the mandible muscles (and associated neurons) are further degraded,
  the fungus may be scavenging and converting the available acetylcholine to choline,
  thereby rapidly reducing acetylcholine levels. The fungus may be converting choline
  to phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholines to remodel and build cell membranes.
  Although we detected multiple phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine class
  features, we did not identify the singular metabolites 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
  and 1-acyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, annotated as “phosphatidylcholine”
  and “phosphatidylethanolamine” in the KEGG glycerophospholipid pathway, respectively.
  The legend is the same as described in this figure, with the additional inclusion
  of genes that nearly qualified as DEGs depicted in gray.
