caption: 'Effects of HBOT on the protein expressions of CREB/BDNF signaling pathway
  in the mid-brain tissue of MPTP-treated mice and the neurite outgrowth of MPP+-treated
  SH-SY5Y cells. Protein expression of (A) pCREB/CREB and (B) BDNF were detected by
  Western blotting. RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells were treated with MPP+ (1 mM)
  for 1 h followed by hyperbaric oxygen at 2.5 ATA with 100% oxygen for 1 h. (C) Cells
  were stained with anti-α-Tubulin (neuronal marker) antibody and counterstained with
  DAPI for observing neurite (scale bar = 50 µm) and (D) measuring the neurite length.
  All data are expressed as mean ± SEM (n = 3). # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01 and ### p
  < 0.001 compared with the control group; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001
  compared with the MPTP or MPP+ group.'
