caption: Overview of the metabolite classification and pathway analysis of the metabolites
  identified in the extracts of the differentiated THP-1 cells after 24 h treatment
  with different types of NPs (F-127, F-68, P-85, PEG, and PLGA) and control (no treatment)
  analyzed with LCâ€“MS. (A) Classes of the identified metabolites and (B) pathway analysis
  of significantly altered metabolites between the different classes compared to the
  control.
