caption: Cartoon depicting TNFR1-induced signalling pathway and IFN mediated upregulation
  of MLKL and ZBP1, that can culminate with MLKL activation and necroptosis. Binding
  of TNF to TNFR1 triggers the formation of a membrane-bound complex referred to as
  complex-I. This complex is composed of adaptor proteins (e.g., TRADD and TRAF2),
  E3 ligases (e.g., cIAP1/2 and LUBAC) that synthesize poly-ubiquitin chains of different
  topology (i.e., K63, K48, K11 and M1) and kinases, such as RIPK1 and IKK1/2, and
  itÂ leads to NF-kB and MAPKs activation and expression of pro-survival as well as
  pro-inflammatory genes. Alternatively, upon interferon receptors activation and/or
  IFN signaling activation, Mlkl and Zbp1 are transcriptionally upregulated. Under
  certain circumstances, described in the main text, a secondary cytoplasmic complexes
  forms, referred to as complex-II. This complex promotes Caspase-8 activation and
  apoptosis. However, upon Caspase-8 inhibition by the means of synthetic or viral
  encoded caspase inhibitors, RIPK1 activates RIPK3 that in turn phosphorylates MLKL.
  Following interferon signaling, ZBP1 is upregulated and activated following binding
  to double-stranded RNA. Upon activation, ZBP1 binds to RIPK3 via RHIM/RHIM interaction,
  triggering RIPK3 phosphorylation and the consequent MLKL activation. Phosphorylated
  MLKL undergoes a conformation change to expose its 4 helical bundle (4HB) domain
  that promotes MLKL association with the plasma membrane. Here MLKL oligomerizes
  and disrupt plasma membrane integrity, causing necroptosis.
