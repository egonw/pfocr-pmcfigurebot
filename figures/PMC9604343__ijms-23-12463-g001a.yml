caption: Comparison of the gene pair correlations for genes in the top 10 significant
  biological pathways between healthy controls (left) and colon cancer patients (right).
  The 10 biological pathways are neuroactive ligand–receptor interaction, systemic
  lupus erythematosus, cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction, pathways in cancer,
  bile secretion, Wnt signaling pathway, cell adhesion molecules, metabolism of xenobiotics
  by cytochrome P450, drug metabolism, and tight junction. Positive and negative correlations
  were shown in blue and red, respectively.
