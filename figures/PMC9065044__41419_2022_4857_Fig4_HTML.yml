caption: 'A Representative images of xenografts formed by subcutaneous injection of
  A549 cells stably transfected with empty vector (mock) or POU6F1 into the dorsal
  flanks of nude mice (n = 5 for each group). B Tumor weight at the endpoints (B left
  panel) and in vivo growth curve (B right panel) of xenografts formed by subcutaneous
  injection of A549 cells stably transfected with mock or POU6F1 into the dorsal flanks
  of nude mice (n = 5 for each group). C Representative images (left panel) and quantification
  (right panel) of immunohistochemical staining revealing the expression of Ki-67
  and CD31 within xenografts formed by subcutaneous injection of A549 cells stably
  transfected with mock or POU6F1 into dorsal flanks of nude mice. Scale bar: 100 μm.
  D–F Representative images (D), HE staining (E), metastatic counts of lungs (F left
  panel), and Kaplan–Meier curves (F right panel) of nude mice treated with tail vein
  injection of A549 cells stably transfected with mock or POU6F1 (n = 5 for each group).
  Scale bar: 100 μm. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.'
