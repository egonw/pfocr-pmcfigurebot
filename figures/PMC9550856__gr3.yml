caption: Characterization of macrophage phenotypes in SST enthesis of mice at postoperative
  week 2 (A) Representative flow cytometry plots showing the percentages of M1 (F4/80+CD86+)
  and M2 (F4/80+CD206+) phenotype within SST enthesis (B) Quantification of flow cytometry
  data in (A). n ​= ​3 per group (C) Gene expression profiles of M1 macrophage marker
  (TNF-a, iNOS, and CCR7) and M2 macrophage marker (Arg, IL-10, and CD206) in SST
  enthesis tissue. n ​= ​4 per group. Expression of interest genes is normalized to
  β-actin and given as a relative change. SST, supraspinatus tendon. ∗P ​< ​0.05 represents
  significant differences between the indicated columns.
