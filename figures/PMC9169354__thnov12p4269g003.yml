caption: Functional mechanisms of circRNAs modulating the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway
  in various forms of cancer. This figure illustrates the circRNAs associated with
  the Hippo-YAP signaling axis in different forms of human cancers. The left column
  indicates the types of cancer in which these related circRNAs are functionally implicated.
  The column in the middle depicts the circRNA that has been described to alter YAP1
  expression in breast cancer and liver cancer through an efficient protein binding
  mechanism that halts YAP1 translation. The right column lists those circRNAs that
  have been observed to act as sponges for miRNA, leading to cancer development and
  progression.
