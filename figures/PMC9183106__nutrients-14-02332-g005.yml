caption: 'P53 signaling pathway played a critical role in alleviating the hypoxia-induced
  apoptosis of BeWo cells. (A) The mRNA expressions of P53, MDM2, and P21 were estimated
  by RT-qPCR. ACTB was used as an internal control. (B) The protein expressions of
  P53, MDM2, and P21 were detected using Wes. ACTB was used as an internal control,
  and the relative protein expression was the ratio of the target protein to ACTB.
  Data are expressed as the mean ± standard error (Mean ± SEM). a: comparing with
  the control groups, p < 0.05; b: comparing with the hypoxia groups, p < 0.05; c:
  comparing with the hypoxia+shRNA-P53 groups, p <0.05; d: comparing with the hypoxia
  + NOB groups, p < 0.05.'
