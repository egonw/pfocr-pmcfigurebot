caption: We analyzed the relationship between levels of BCAAs with tissue‐specific
  adipose depots (EAT and HS) and oCAD. We looked at both associations (orange lines),
  causal relationships (blue arrows), and mediation analyses (green dotted lines).
  Our results support a model whereby BCAAs are associated with HS but are not in
  the causal pathway. This supports current literature implicating BCAA by‐products
  as causal in development of HS. BCAAs were also found to mediate the association
  between HS and oCAD; however, BCAAs are not in the causal pathway for oCAD, suggesting
  that the mediation results we see are due to a proximal (ie, obesity) or distal
  (ie, branched‐chain keto acids) effect rather than BCAAs themselves. Furthermore,
  BCAA association with EAT disappeared after adjustment for total body adiposity
  (body mass index). BCAAs indicates branched‐chain amino acids; EAT, epicardial adipose
  tissue; HS, hepatic steatosis; MR, Mendelian randomization; and oCAD, obstructive
  coronary artery disease.
