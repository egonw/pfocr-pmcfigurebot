caption: Schematic representation of cell competition and super competition.(A) Cell
  competition through fitness fingerprints. Suboptimal cell expresses a less-fit Flower
  protein (FweLoseB) marker on their surface, while the wild-type cells express a
  fit marker (Fweubi). In the less-fit cell, a closer view of the pathway involved
  in fitness comparison and cell death induction is shown. Interaction between FweLoseB
  expressing cells and Fweubi expressing cells leads to the transcription of azot,
  which induces apoptosis of suboptimal cell. Induction of apoptosis leads to cell
  fragmentation. (B) Super competition. Super competitor cell expresses dMyc which
  results in proliferation of super competitor cell. This leads to the apoptosis of
  neighboring wild-type cells. Induction of apoptosis leads to cell fragmentation.
