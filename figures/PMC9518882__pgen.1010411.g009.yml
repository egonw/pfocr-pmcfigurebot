figure_title: Mechanism of miR-309a in the regulation of ovarian development in B.
  dorsalis
caption: During early ovarian development, miR-309a has lowered expression due to
  JH suppression and cannot inhibit pnr expression. At this stage, pnr induces the
  expression of Vg-related genes in ovarian development to maintain normal physiological
  activities. With the reduction of JH inhibition, miR-309a up-regulates and inhibits
  the expression of pnr to avoid excessive expression of Vg-related genes (Vg2 and
  VgR). JH may act as the upstream switch of the miR-309a regulatory pathway to maintain
  the balance and stability of the whole pathway by inhibiting miR-309a expression.
