figure_title: NSE is highly expressed in sphere cells and regulates the percentage
  of CSCs
caption: 'A Western blot detects the expression level of NSE in different SCLC cell
  lines, and the relative protein levels (NSE/β-actin) were quantified as the column
  graph (B). C–E The expression levels of NSE and ALDH1A1 in spherical cells were
  significantly increased (C: H446 cell; D: H69 cell; E: H209 cell). F–H All western
  blot images were quantified by the ImageJ software to estimate the relative protein
  expression (protein /β-actin) (F: H446 cell; G: H69 cell; H: H209 cell). I NSE overexpression
  enriched the percentage of the ALDHhigh CSC population. NSE overexpression in H446
  cells (H446-NSE), negative control cells (H446-EV). J The bar charts represent the
  proportion of the ALDHhigh CSC population. K Knockdown of NSE diminished the ALDHhigh
  CSC population in SCLC cells. They silenced NSE in H69 cells (H69-shNSE) negative
  control cells (H69-NTC). L The bar charts represent the percentage of the ALDHhigh
  CSC population. Results are shown as mean ± SD of independent experiments, and each
  experiment was repeated thrice.'
