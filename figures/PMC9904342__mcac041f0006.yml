caption: Gene expression profiles for phenylpropanoid genes and for the chlorogenic
  acid biosynthetic pathway. Expression profiles for putative biosynthetic genes in
  C. arabica, C. canephora and C. eugenioides (left panel), as well as allele-specific
  expression of Ca and Ea homeologue pairs in C. arabica (right panel). The x-axis
  represents seed developmental stages in chronological order and the y-axis represents
  the gene expression level as normalized read counts. C3H, 4-coumarate 3-hydroxylase;
  C3â€²H, p-coumaroyl CoA 3-hydroxylase; C4H, trans-cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; CCoAOMT,
  caffeoyl-CoA 3-O-methyltransferase; 4CL, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase; COMT, caffeic acid
  O-methyltransferase; CSE, caffeoyl shikimate esterase; HCT, hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:shikimate/quinate
  hydroxycinnamoyl transferase; HQT, hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA quinate hydroxycinnamoyl
  transferase; PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase.
