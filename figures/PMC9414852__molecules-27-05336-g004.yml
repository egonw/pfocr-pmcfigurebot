caption: MOBT blocked lung fibrogenesis via inhibiting MEF2c stability. (A) The RIP
  assay showed that MOBT reduced the combination of pre-mMEF2c with hnRNP L. IgG was
  used as a control. (B) The Western blot analysis revealed that MEF2c expression
  increased in the TGF-β1-treated cells for different time points. (C) The Western
  blot analysis showed that 10 µg/mL MOBT decreased the MEF2c expression. (D) The
  immunofluorescence result demonstrated that the TGF-β1 group expressed abundant
  MEF2c compared with the normal group, whereas the TGF-β1 + MOBT group decreased
  the MEF2c expression. The green color indicates MEF2c. The blue color indicates
  the nucleus. (E) The immunofluorescence images showed that the MEF2c expression
  increased in IPF patient’s lung tissues compared with the normal tissue adjacent
  to lung cancer. The green color indicates MEF2c. The blue color indicates the nucleus.
  (F) Stability testing showed that MEF2c stability was promoted by TGF-β1 and decreased
  by MOBT treatment. The half-life in each group was 4.36, 11.65, and 5.96 h in the
  normal, TGF-β1, and TGF-β1 + MOBT groups, respectively. Each bar represents mean
  ± SD, * p < 0.05.
