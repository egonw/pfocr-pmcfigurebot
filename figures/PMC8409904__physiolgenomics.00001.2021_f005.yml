caption: 'Functional pathways of “metabolic disease” with calculated z-scores, wherein
  a negative z-score indicates inhibition of the pathway, and a positive z-score indicates
  pathway activation. A: functional pathways of “metabolic disease” predicted to be
  activated by ovariectomy (OVX). B: functional pathways of “metabolic disease” predicted
  to be inhibited/activated by OVX in the context of chronic binge alcohol (CBA).
  C: functional pathways of “metabolic disease” predicted to be inhibited by CBA in
  the context of OVX. The number at the end of each bar represents the number of proteins
  within the pathway that are changed. VEH-SHAM (n = 4); CBA-SHAM (n = 4); VEH-OVX
  (n = 5); CBA-OVX (n = 3).'
