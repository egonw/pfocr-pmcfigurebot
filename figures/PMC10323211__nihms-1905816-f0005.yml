caption: a, c, Pathway diagrams for (a) JAK/STAT and (c) Wnt signalling. Nodes coloured
  based on hazard ratio (HR) of the genetic score for (a) coronary artery disease
  (CAD) and (c) hypothyroidism. Nodes are white if there is not a corresponding genetic
  score. The most significant HR across omic platforms is used at each node. Nodes
  are bold if the genetic score had FDR-adjusted p-value < 0.05 (two-sided Wald test
  and correcting for 11,576 tested traits). b, d, Forest plots of FDR-significant
  HRs for (b) CAD (n = 28,854 cases and 390,159 controls) and (d) hypothyroidism (n
  = 21,871 cases and 404,440 controls) for genetic scores in (b) JAK/STAT or (d) Wnt
  signalling. e, Forest plot of HRs and 95% confidence intervals for the genetic score
  of USP25 (SomaScan) across multiple diseases.
