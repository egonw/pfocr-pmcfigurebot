caption: 'The function of DAXX and the association between DAXX and circRNA-0044301.
  (A) qRT-PCR analysis of DAXX and DHRS12 expression in mimics-miRNA-188-5p or nc-miRNA-188-5p
  and si-circRNA-0044301 or nc-circRNA-0044301 transfected cells. (B) RIP-qRT-PCR
  experiments confirmed the interaction between miRNA-188-5p and DAXX. (C) Correlation
  analysis of DAXX expression level and circRNA-0044301 expression level; their expression
  was positively correlated (p < 0.0001). (D) RIP-qRT-PCR experiments confirmed the
  interaction between circRNA-0044301 and DAXX. (E) CCK-8 assay of the cell viability
  of HGC-27 cells with si-DAXX or nc-DAXX transfection (***: p < 0.001; **: p < 0.01;
  *: p < 0.05). (F) Wound healing assay for the cell migration ability of GC cells
  after knockdown of DAXX over time (0 h and 24 h), and the percentage of wound closure
  was statistically analyzed (the samples were imaged at 50× magnification. Scale
  bar = 200 μm). (G) Results of Transwell assays with si-DAXX and nc-DAXX transfection
  into HGC-27 cells (the samples were imaged at 200x magnification. Scale bar = 50
  μm). (H) CCK-8 assay for the cell viability of GC cells after si-DAXX, si-circRNA-0044301,
  and co-transfection into HGC-27 cells; the viability of the GC cell lines in the
  co-transfection group was significantly lower than that in the single transfection
  group (***: p < 0.001; **: p < 0.01; *: p < 0.05). (I) Transwell assay for the cell
  invasion ability of GC cells after si-DAXX, si-circRNA-0044301, or co-transfection
  into HGC-27 cells; the invasion ability of the GC cell lines in the co-transfection
  group was significantly lower than that in the single transfection group (the samples
  were imaged at 200x magnification. Scale bar = 50 μm. ***: p < 0.001).'
