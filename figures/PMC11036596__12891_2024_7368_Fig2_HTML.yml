caption: Expression of LRP5 activating Wnt/Ca2+signaling pathway in nucleus pulposus
  cells. (A) UMAP Plot showing the expression of LRP5 in NP-degenerative and NP-normal.
  (B) Violin plot showing the expression of LRP5 in five Chondrocyte clusters. (C)
  Differential expression analysis was performed comparing LRP5 within NP-degenerative
  and NP-normal. Stars indicate significance level of gene expression difference between
  two samples by Wilcox test. ***, p value < 0.001
