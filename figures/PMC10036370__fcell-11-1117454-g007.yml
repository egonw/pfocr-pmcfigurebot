caption: Cell cycle progression and endo-lysosomal trafficking is disrupted in prto
  KD epithelial wing cells. (A–A‴) Expression of the FUCCI system in the posterior
  compartment using en>driver. (A) DAPI expression labelling the nuclei. (A′) DAPI
  and NLS-dCycB-mRNP expression labelling cells in S and G2 phases and entering Mitosis.
  (A′) DAPI and dE2F1-GFP expression labelling cells in G1, G2 and mitosis. (A‴) NLS-dCycB-mRNP
  and dE2F1-GFP expression. (B–B‴) FUCCI expression in the posterior compartment in
  prto KD wing imaginal disc labelled as in (A). Note that more epithelial cells in
  prto KD wing discs seem to be expressing both cell cycle markers suggesting that
  cells could be a stalled G2-Mitosis transition. Scale bar 40 µm. (C–C‴) Expression
  of lysosomal (LAMP1-GFP; (C)) and endosomal (FYVE-cherry; (C′)) markers in the posterior
  compartment in control wing imaginal discs. Merged image (C″) and with nuclei (DAPI;
  (C‴)). A distinctive puncta pattern of endosomes (white arrowheads) and lysosomes
  (yellow arrowheads) is observed in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. Co-localization
  of both markers are highlighted with an arrow. Higher magnification is shown in
  inset in (C‴). Scale bar 20 µm. (D–D‴) prto KD wing imaginal disc labelled as in
  (C). The patterns of endosomes and lysosomes have become broader. Higher magnification
  is shown in inset. Scale bar 20 µm. (E,F) Expression of an Atg8a-Cherry construct
  in the posterior wing compartment with en>UAS-Dcr control (E) and with prto-RNAi
  (F). Merge with DAPI (E′) and (F′) respectively. An increase of aberrant autophagosomes
  in posterior is observed in prto KD discs (arrows). Scale bar 20 µm.
