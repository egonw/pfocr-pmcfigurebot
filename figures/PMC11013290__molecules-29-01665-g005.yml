caption: 'The inhibitory effect of LGU on OGD-induced intracellular calcium overload
  in rat primary cortical neurons. (A) Representative image of intracellular Ca2+
  fluorescent intensity detected by Fluo-3/AM probe and CLSM (600×). (B) Quantitative
  analysis of LGU on the intracellular Ca2+ fluorescent intensity at 4 h after OGD
  exposure. (C) Quantitative analysis of the inhibitory effect of LGU on intracellular
  Ca2+ concentration at 4 h after OGD exposure detected by Ca2+ assay kit. Data are
  expressed as the mean ± SEM, n = 3. ###: p < 0.001 vs. ctrl group; *: p < 0.05,
  and ***: p < 0.001 vs. OGD group.'
