caption: 'Bioinformatic analysis of the proteins increased and decreased in the comparison
  between the high-fat and normal chow groups. (A) Bioinformatic analyses by Cluego
  software (Cytoskape release 3.8.2) within the set of increased and decreased proteins.
  Functional grouping was based on p value â‰¤ 0.05. GO terms fusion allowed at least
  3 counts. (B) Proteins increased and identified by Cluego as involved in lipid metabolism
  were analyzed by String (version 11.0). For clarity, the figure reports only proteins
  linked in a network. The color indicates proteins involved in a specific process:
  fatty acid catabolic process (blue), thermogenesis (red), amyloid fibril formation
  (green), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) signaling pathway
  (yellow). (C) Proteins decreased and identified by Cluego as involved in lipid metabolism
  were analyzed by String (version 11.0). For clarity, the figure reports only proteins
  linked in a network. The color indicates proteins involved in a specific process:
  peroxisome (red), mitochondria (green), mitochondrial envelop (blue), fatty acid
  beta oxidation (yellow), tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), and electron transport
  (magenta).'
