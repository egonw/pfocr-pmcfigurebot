caption: Multifactorial signaling is involved in VSMC osteo/chondrogenic transdifferentiation
  regulation. Various molecules directly or indirectly mediate the VSMC osteo/chondrogenic
  transdifferentiation process via cross-talking interaction. For example, phosphate
  and ECM components activate the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway to upregulate the osteogenic
  transcriptional factors Runx2 and BMP2. Moreover, calcium and phosphate activate
  the Pit-1 signaling pathway and interact with the IL-6 and PTH signaling pathways.
  PTH binds to PTH1R and ignites NF-κB signaling pathways through ERK1/2, integrating
  TNF-α stimulation. Additionally, TNF-α stimulates AP-1 via c-FOS to increase osteo-/chondrogenic
  genes expression, coordinating the IL-6/sIL-6R/STAT3/p53/p21 pathways to trigger
  VSMC transdifferentiation. As an interfering agent, IMD1-53 upregulates Sirt1 by
  activating the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway or upregulating α-klotho levels via the
  CRLR/RAMP3 complex to inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling. miR-30B promotes the MMP
  and autophagy-related to the mTOR signal pathway, and crosstalk exists between this
  signaling pathway and NF-κB. PTH, parathyroid hormone; TLR4, toll-like receptor
  4; ERK1/2, Extracellular regulated protein kinases 1/2; PTH1R, parathyroid hormone
  1 receptor; sIL-6R, soluble IL-6 receptor; STAT3, signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3; IMD1-53, intermedin 1-53; CRLR, calcitonin receptor-like receptor;
  RAMP3, receptor activity-modifying protein-3; and MMP, mitochondrial membrane potential.
