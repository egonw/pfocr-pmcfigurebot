caption: Insulin and palmitic acid suppress the protein expression of HBP1 and the
  combination of HBP1 and IGFBP1 promoter. (A) Insulin activates p-AKT signaling pathway
  and inhibits protein expression of HBP1 and IGFBP1. The protein levels of HBP1,
  IGFBP1, p-AKT, p-GSK-3α/β, p-IGF-1R, AKT, GSK-3α/β and IGF-1R were measured by western
  blotting in L02 and AML12 cells. β-actin was used as a loading control. Quantification
  was normalized to β-actin. (B) Insulin can attenuate both the IGFBP1 promoter activity
  and the activation effect of HBP1 on IGFBP1 promoter. 293T cells were co-transfected
  with the IGFBP1 promoter and HA-HBP1 plasmid and were treated with or without insulin.
  Luciferase activities were determined 24 hours after transfection and were analyzed
  from four separate experiments. (C) Insulin inhibits the binding ability of HBP1
  and IGFBP1 promoter. ChIP assays were carried out to verify the binding of exogenous
  HBP1 to the endogenous IGFBP1. 293T cells transfected with HA-HBP1 were treated
  with or without insulin. The region of IGFBP1 promoter contains the HBP1 affinity
  site and was analyzed by specific PCR. Anti-HA antibody was used in the indicated
  lanes. Lanes were quantitated by Image J software. (D) Palmitic acid inhibits protein
  expression of HBP1 and IGFBP1. The protein levels of HBP1 and IGFBP1 were measured
  by western blotting in L02 and AML12 cells. β-actin was used as a loading control.
  Quantification of HBP1 and IGFBP1 protein expression was normalized to β-actin.
  (E) Palmitic acid weaken the luciferase activities of HBP1 on IGFBP1 promoter. 293T
  cells were co-transfected with the IGFBP1 promoter and HA-HBP1 plasmid and were
  treated with or without palmitic acid. Luciferase activity was determined 24 hours
  after transfection and analyzed from four separate experiments. (F) Palmitic acid
  restrains the binding ability of HBP1 and IGFBP1 promoter. ChIP assays were performed
  to verify the binding of exogenous HBP1 to the endogenous IGFBP1 gene. 293T cells
  transfected with HA-HBP1 were treated with or without palmitic acid. The region
  of IGFBP1 promoter contains the HBP1 affinity site and was analyzed by specific
  PCR. Anti-HA antibody was used in the indicated lanes. Lanes were quantitated by
  Image J software. (G) The protein level of HBP1 decreases gradually with the increasing
  of PA dose. The protein levels of HBP1 were measured by western blotting in L02
  and AML12 cells. β-actin was used as a loading control. Quantification was normalized
  to β-actin. (H) With the increase of PA duration, the protein level of HBP1 firstly
  increased and then decreased significantly. The protein levels of HBP1 were measured
  by western blotting in L02 and AML12 cells. β-actin was used as a loading control.
  Quantification was normalized to β-actin. Data were the mean ± SD by a two-tail,
  unpaired Student’s t-test. *, p<0.05. **, p<0.01.
