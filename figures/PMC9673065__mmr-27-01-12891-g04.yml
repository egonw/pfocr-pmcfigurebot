caption: Transwell assay was used to detected cell invasion. Compared with PANC-1
  group, the invasion of KRASWT group was weakened and the invasion of KRASG12D group
  was enhanced. (A) Representative images from one of the experiments. (B) Statistical
  data from three experiments presented as the mean ± standard deviation (n=3; **P<0.01).
  Scale bar=400 µm. KRAS, Kirsten rat sarcoma virus; WT, wild-type.
article_title: Wild-type KRAS inhibits the migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer
  through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
