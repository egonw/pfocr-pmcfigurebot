figure_title: UPL3-interacting proteins overlapping with differentially ubiquitin
  conjugates (DUCs) identify potential UPL3-ubiquitinated substrates ABCG36, MS2,
  OEP6, PPC2, and LOS1
caption: (A) Immunodetection of protein samples isolated from GFP- and UPL3-GFPâ€“expressing
  plants with an antibody against GFP. (B) Nano-trapped proteins for MS analysis.
  (C) Overlapping proteins between UPL3-interacting candidates and the DUCs. Eighty-one
  putative interacting proteins were identified as specific to UPL3-GFP, which contained
  29 and 11 DUCs with a fold-change |FC| > 1.2 or 1.5, respectively. (D) Enrichment
  of the KEGG pathway in the overlapping genes highlights an involvement of potential
  UPL3-ubiquitinated substrates in the IP3K pathway and in ribosomal activity. Red
  color indicates up-regulated, and blue color indicates down-regulated. (E) List
  of most notable interacting candidates of UPL3 with their respective fold-change
  of ubiquitination level in upl3 versus wild-type plants. Orange indicates up, and
  blue color indicates down. The fold-change is indicated with the data.Source data
  are available for this figure.
