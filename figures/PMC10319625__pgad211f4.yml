caption: cAQ-mBen regulates gene expression as seen by using RNA-Seq analysis. a)
  Venn diagram of DEGs induced by cAQ-mBen treatment. b) The distribution of the number
  of PQS in the promoter region (−1 to 1 kb) and gene body of genes with upregulated
  and downregulated expression after cAQ-mBen treatment. The vertical lines are mean
  values. c) KEGG pathways associated with cAQ-mBen treatment. Each node represents
  an enriched KEGG pathway. The size of the node indicates the number of genes enriched
  in the pathway. Two nodes connected by an edge have similar enriched genes. d) The
  heatmap of the logFC values of the genes related to telomere extension by telomerase
  from the Reactome database, and the bar plot indicates the PQS counts per kilobase
  on promoter and gene body. The asterisks represent the false discovery rate (FDR)
  used for the differential gene expression analysis using edgeR (*FDR < 0.05, **FDR
  < 0.01, ***FDR < 0.001).
