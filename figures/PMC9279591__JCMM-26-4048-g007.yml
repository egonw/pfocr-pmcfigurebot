caption: BRAF V600E mediates the p‐ERK‐p‐GSKα/β‐CypD pathway to prevent mPTP opening
  by interacting with mitochondrial ERK in 8505C cells. (A) Endogenous BRAF V600E
  was localized to the mitochondria. After Nthy‐ori‐3.1 thyroid cell (BRAF WT), FTC‐133
  cell (BRAF WT), BCPAP cells (BRAF V600E mutant), 8505C cells (BRAF V600E mutant)
  and HCT116 human colon cancer cells (BRAF V600E mutant) were lysed, mitochondria
  were isolated by centrifugation. The localization of BRAF V600E and BRAF WT in mitochondria
  was detected by western blotting. Tubulin was used as a cytoplasmic marker, COX
  IV and VDAC were used as a mitochondrial marker. Calnexin as ER marker should be
  present at comparable levels in cytosol. (B) 8505C cells (BRAF V600E) were fixed
  and processed for immunofluorescence staining of BRAF (green fluorescence) and mitochondria
  (MitoTracker, red fluorescence). (C) 8505C cells were infected with adenoviruses
  overexpressing BRAF V600E，cytosol and mitochondria were isolated by centrifugation.
  Western blotting was used for detecting CypD, phosphorylated and total ERK1/2 and
  GSKα/β levels. Tubulin was used as a cytoplasmic marker, COX IV and VDAC as a mitochondrial
  marker. Calnexin as ER marker should be present at comparable levels in cytosol.
  (D) Statistical data showing the ratio of p‐ERK/ERK and p‐GSK/GSK of C. Statistical
  analysis was done by one‐way anova. ***p < 0.001 vs. control. (E) 8505C cells were
  infected with adenoviruses expressing BRAF V600E shRNA or overexpression and mitochondria
  were isolated by centrifugation. Western blotting was used for detecting phosphorylated
  and total ERK1/2 levels. COX IV as a mitochondrial marker. (F) Interaction between
  ERK1/2 and GSKα/β was detected by immunoprecipitation. 8505C cells were infected
  with adenoviruses expressing BRAF V600E shRNA, and mitochondria were isolated by
  centrifugation. Mitochondria were lysed and the interaction between ERK1/2 and GSKα/β
  were detected by immunoprecipitation and western blotting. (G) Nthy‐ori‐3.1 thyroid
  cells infected with adenoviruses overexpressing BRAF V600E and exposed to 10 μM
  sorafenib, the ratio of p‐ERK/ERK was measured by western blotting. (H) Nthy‐ori‐3.1
  thyroid cells infected with adenoviruses overexpressing BRAF V600E and exposed to
  10 μM sorafenib, the p‐ERK in mitochondria was measured by western blotting. (I)
  Nthy‐ori‐3.1 thyroid cells infected with adenoviruses overexpressing BRAF V600E
  and exposed to 15 μM PLX4720, the ratio of p‐ERK/ERK was measured by western blotting.
  (J) Nthy‐ori‐3.1 thyroid cells infected with adenoviruses overexpressing BRAF V600E
  and exposed to 15 μM PLX4720, the p‐ERK in mitochondria was measured by western
  blotting
