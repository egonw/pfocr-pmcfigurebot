caption: 'Pathophysiology and therapeutic targets of AQP4-IgG+NMOSD and MOGAD. AQP4-IgG
  and MOG-IgG are generated in the periphery before entering the CNS. B-cells are
  important for antibody production and are inhibited by rituximab and inebilizumab.
  IL-6 is a common important driver involved in T- and B-cell differentiation and
  inflammation. IL-6 receptor is inhibited by tocilizumab and satralizumab. In AQP4-IgG+NMOSD,
  complement-dependent cytotoxicity is a prominent mechanism of attacks that leads
  to astrocyte death followed by demyelination. The complement pathway is blocked
  by eculizumab and ravulizumab. In MOGAD, complement is also thought to play a role
  and may act predominantly through oligodendrocytes. However, complement inhibitors
  have not been explored in MOGAD. AQP4: Aquaporin-4; NMOSD: Neuromyelitis optica
  spectrum disorder; CNS: Central nervous system; MAC: Membrane attack complex; MOG:
  Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein; MOGAD: MOG antibody-associated disease; IL-6:
  Interleukin-6'
