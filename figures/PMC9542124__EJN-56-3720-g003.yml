caption: 'Smaller ischaemic lesion in GC‐C KO mice. Volumetric analysis of hemispheres,
  lesion volumes and oedema size in GC‐C WT (n = 5), GC‐C KO (n = 6), UGN WT (n = 8)
  and UGN KO (n = 6) animals was performed by MR imaging. (a) The original MR images
  of ischaemic lesions of GC‐C WT and GC‐C KO animals taken before (BL) and after
  MCAO (24 h) are shown. (b) In GC‐C KO animals and their WT littermates (GC‐C WT),
  there was a statistically significant increase in the volume of the ipsilateral
  hemisphere 24 h after MCAO. At the same time point, the volume of the ipsilateral
  hemisphere was bigger than the contralateral hemisphere in both groups of animals.
  Data were analysed with an unpaired ANOVA test with a post hoc Tukey test. *p = .0004
  statistically significant difference between ipsilateral hemispheres of GC‐C WT
  mice before and after MCAO; #p = .0355 statistically significant difference between
  ipsilateral hemispheres of GC‐C KO mice before and after MCAO; $p = .00001 statistically
  significant difference between ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres of GC‐C
  WT mice 24 h after MCAO; ǂ p = .001 statistically significant difference between
  ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres of GC‐C KO mice 24 h after MCAO (F(7,36) = 9.727,
  p = 1 × 10−8). (c) GC‐C KO animals developed significantly smaller ischaemic lesions
  when compared with GC‐C WT animals. *p = .0386. (d) No difference in oedema size
  was observed between the two test groups. Data were analysed with unpaired Students
  t‐test. (e) The original MR images of ischaemic lesions of UGN WT and UGN KO animals
  taken before (BL) and after MCAO (24 h) are shown. (f) In UGN KO animals and their
  WT littermates (UGN WT), there was an increase in the volume of the ipsilateral
  hemisphere 24 h after MCAO. At the same time point, the volume of the ipsilateral
  hemisphere was bigger than the contralateral hemisphere in both groups of animals.
  Data were analysed with an unpaired ANOVA test with a post hoc Tukey test. *p = 6 × 10−8
  statistically significant difference between ipsilateral hemispheres of UGN WT mice
  before and after MCAO; #p = .0001 statistically significant difference between ipsilateral
  hemispheres of UGN KO mice before and after MCAO; $p = 9 × 10−10 statistically significant
  difference between ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres of UGN WT mice 24 h
  after MCAO; ǂp = .000003 statistically significant difference between ipsilateral
  and contralateral hemispheres of UGN KO mice 24 h after MCAO (F(7,48) = 20.490,
  p = 2 × 10−12). (g) UGN littermates developed similar lesion sizes. (h) No difference
  in oedema size was observed between the two test groups. Data were analysed with
  unpaired Students t‐test. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. BL, baseline (volume
  of the hemispheres before MCAO)'
