figure_title: Inferred Metabolic Pathway Abundance by Smoking Status
caption: CLR-normalized inferred abundance of MetaCyc pathways as calculated by PICRUSt2.
  (A) Normalized pathway abundance in current (red), former (green), and never smokers
  (blue). Pathways grouped by MetaCyc SuperPathway definition as oxidative/degradative
  or biosynthetic. Unclassified pathways noted as “Other.” (B) Correlation between
  imputed pathways and ANCOM-identified significant taxa, annotated with superpathway
  function and smoking influence on taxonomic abundance. Positive correlation noted
  in red, while negative correlation noted in blue.
