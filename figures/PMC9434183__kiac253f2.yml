caption: 'Profile of primary metabolites in A. thaliana florets. A, Heatmap of primary
  metabolites in eight stages of flower development. Florets in the stage of anthesis
  are 11.50 days old. Each square in the heatmap represents the log2 average of metabolite
  content from three biological replicates each composed of ∼40 florets normalized
  by FW and internal standard. The colored bar atop the heatmap indicates the following
  metabolite–pathway associations: light blue, sugar and starch metabolism; tan, TCA
  cycle; green, amino acids; lilac, shikimate pathway; gray, ascorbate and other compounds.
  B, Schematic representation of metabolic pathways (left) and boxplots (right) representing
  the content of primary metabolites measured in Arabidopsis florets in each of the
  eight stages of development relative to the youngest stage (7.29 days old buds).
  The boxplots show the median (central bar), the interquartile range (box), and minimum
  and maximum values (vertical bars). The color of the boxplots represents metabolite-pathway
  associations as previously described. In each square, the stage of anthesis is represented
  in white. 2OG, 2-Oxoglutarate; F6P, fructose-6P; G6P, glucose-6P; OAA, Oxaloacetate;
  OAS, O-acetylserine; PHBA, p-hydroxybenzoic acid; R5P, ribulose-5P.'
