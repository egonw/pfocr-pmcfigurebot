caption: BRAF pathway and its inhibition. Under physiological conditions, BRAF activation
  strictly depends on RAS-GTP binding forms. Once activated, RAF isoforms create either
  homo- or heterodimers, eventually leading to the phosphorylation of MEK 1/2 and
  their downstream pathway. Conversely, BRAF class I mutations can directly activate
  downstream MEK 1/2 in an RAS-independent manner, resulting in deregulated proliferation
  and survival. BRAF inhibitors (dabrafenib, trametinib and encorafenib) combined
  with MEK inhibitors (trametinib, cobimetinib and binimetinib) eventually hinder
  downstream signalling.
