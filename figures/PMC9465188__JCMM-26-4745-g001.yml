caption: Main mechanisms of HGF/MSC therapy. HGF/MSCs were adopted in treatment for
  a variety of diseases, including ischaemic, heart, lung, liver, urinary system,
  bone and immune‐related diseases. (1) HGF/MSC promote cell migration and engraftment,
  in which SDF‐1α/CXCR‐4 axis and ERK1/2 signalling pathway were involved. (2) HGF/MSCs
  promote cell–cell connection restoration and soft tissue re‐epithelialization. (3)
  HGF/MSCs promote angiogenesis and neurogenesis. (4) HGF/MSCs promote anti‐fibrosis
  effect. (5) HGF/MSCs promote anti‐inflammatory effect. They can deactivate Th1 and
  Th17 cells and activate Treg cells. (6) HGF/MSCs promote anti‐apoptosis effect.
  (7) HGF/MSCs promote anti‐oxidation effect. Bcl, B‐cell lymphoma; COL, collagen;
