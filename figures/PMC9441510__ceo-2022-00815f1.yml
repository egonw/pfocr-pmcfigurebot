caption: The anatomical pathways associated with three different aspects of tinnitus
  (loudness, suffering, and presence). A sound stimulus leads to a cognitive, emotional,
  and autonomic response, which is phenomenologically expressed as catastrophizing,
  attention paid to the tinnitus, unpleasantness, fear, anger or frustration with
  tinnitus, and arousal/distress. These cognitive, emotional, and autonomic symptoms
  are all phenomenological expressions of altered activity in the medial pathway.
