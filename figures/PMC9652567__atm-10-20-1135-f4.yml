caption: 'Atorvastatin reduced neurological deficit after cerebral infarction by activating
  the Nrf2 signaling pathway. (A) The rotarod test and mNSS assessment (B) were performed
  at the indicated time points to evaluate neurological deficit. **P<0.01 vs. Nrf2+/+
  vehicle, Nrf2−/− vehicle and Nrf2−/− Atorv group; ##P<0.01 vs. Nrf2−/− vehicle group;
  &&P<0.01 vs. Nrf2+/+ vehicle group and Nrf2−/− vehicle group. (C) The TTC staining
  images at 72 h after stroke. (D) Quantification of TTC staining on brain slices.
