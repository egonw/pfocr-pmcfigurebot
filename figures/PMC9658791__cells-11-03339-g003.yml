caption: The ISR/ERSR/UPR pathway. Various stressors including ER stress activate
  the ISR []. The ERSR also includes the UPR []. Note that the ISR inhibits general
  protein synthesis and increases translation of select mRNA such as Atf4. Then, ATF4
  mediates the transcriptional arm of the ISR. While regulation of gene transcription
  via sXBP1 and ATF6 is the major component of the UPR, IRE1 may also activate the
  pro-apoptotic kinase JNK as well as degrade ER-associated mRNAs as well as miRNAs
  (not shown on this schematic) []. Unlike the pro-homeostatic transcriptional UPR,
  those IRE1 activities are cytotoxic [].
