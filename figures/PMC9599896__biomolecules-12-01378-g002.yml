caption: E- to N-Cadherin transition in ESCC cells. High expression of PKCK2 can induce
  E- to N-Cadherin transition. In a direct way, PKCK2 phosphorylation stabilises Snail,
  which then inhibits the expression of E-Cadherin. The indirect pathway involves
  the PKCK2 phosphorylation to cause β-Catenin-mediated Axin2 expression, thus resulting
  in Axin2-mediated GSK3β translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol where GSK3β
  inhibits Snail degradation. For the up-regulation of N-Cadherin, MZF1 may be phosphorylated
  to up-regulate N-Cadherin expression, subsequently activating the PKB/Akt signalling
  pathway. In addition, EGFR can also phosphorylate β-Catenin, leading to the dissociation
  of E-Cadherin from the actin cytoskeleton.
