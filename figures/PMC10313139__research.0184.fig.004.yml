caption: NOP2 enhances the Warburg effect on HCC cells. (A and B) Volcano and heatmaps
  showing changes in differential genes after NOP2 KO. (C) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
  and Genomes pathway analysis of RNA-seq data. (D and E) Relative expression levels
  of proteins related to glycolysis in 3 different cell lines. (F) Nontargeted metabolomics
  GC-MS analysis of glycolysis and TCA cycle metabolites in HCC-LM3 cells. (G) Heatmap
  shows changes in metabolites of glycolysis or OXPHOS. (H to K) Glucose uptake (H),
  lactate production (I), pH of the culture medium (J), and OCR (K) were tested in
  3 different cell lines. (L) The ECAR was measured in 3 different cell lines using
  an XF Extracellular Flux Analyzer. n = 3 independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P
  < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
