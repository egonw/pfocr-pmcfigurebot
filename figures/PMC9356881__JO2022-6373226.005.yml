caption: 'The role of HPRS in signal pathway regulation and TME cell infiltration.
  (a): High HPRS versus low HPRS pathway activity in each cohort. (b): The proportion
  of 22 tumor infiltrating cells between high and low HPRS groups in TCGA-derived
  LUAD patients. (c, d): The proportion of 22 tumor infiltrating cells between high
  and low HPRS groups in GSE31210 and GSE50081. (e): Stromal score and immune score
  differences between high and low HPRS in TCGA-derived LUAD patients. (f, g): Stromal
  score and immune score differences between high and low HPRS in GSE31210 and GSE50081.
  (h): Analysis of the correlation between HPRS and the proportion of 22 kinds of
  immune cells in TCGA-derived LUAD patients. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001,
  ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.'
