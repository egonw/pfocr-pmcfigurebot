caption: Phosphate (μM) released from initiation assays of wild-type, Y395F, Y397F,
  and 6YF primase. The mean and standard deviation of the amount of phosphate released
  from 3 independent initiation assays of wild-type, Y395F, Y397F, and 6YF primase
  were 36.8 ± 0.8 μM, 17.0 ± 0.5 μM, 11.8 ± 1.1 μM, 0.9 ± 0.2 μM, respectively (±
  SE).
