figure_title: Notch pathway inhibition abolished the cardioprotective effect of Nogo-B
  in MI-injured hearts
caption: 'A The vessel outgrowth in aortic rings of Nogo-B overexpressed and endothelial
  cell-specific Notch1 heterozygous (Notch1-EC+/−) mice or littermates (n = 3). *P < 0.05
  versus Ad-NC group. #P < 0.05 versus Ad-Nogo-B group. B The survival rate of Notch1-EC+/−
  and Ctrl mice injected with AAV-Nogo-B and AAV-NC after MI. The log-rank test demonstrated
  significant differences between the two survival curves. C LVEF and LVFS were measured
  by echocardiography (n = 5). D Quantitative data of hearts stained with Masson’s
  trichrome at day 28 post-MI (n = 5). E Representation and quantification of IHC
  staining for TUNEL + cardiomyocytes in the border zone of infarcted hearts at day
  3 post-MI (n = 3). F Immunochemistry staining for CD31 + endothelial cells and α-SMA + vessels
  at day 28 post-MI (n = 5). Data were expressed as mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01
  versus AAV-NC group. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 versus AAV-Nogo-B group. two-way ANOVA
  (A and C–F).'
