caption: Postoperative left pulmonary artery stenting in a patient with persistent
  high-volume chest tube output after Fontan procedure. (A) Angiography in the Fontan
  pathway shows moderately severe long-segment left pulmonary artery stenosis (black

  Excellent angiographic result after stent implantation (arrow) resulting in resolution
