caption: Integrative analysis of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data reveals Creb3l1 as a key
  regulator of protein synthesis. A, pie chart displaying the percentage MCN Creb3l1
  ChIP-seq target genes that are also differentially expressed in the SON WD RNA-seq
  data. B, GO and pathway analysis for overlapping genes (192) showing the five most
  enriched terms for biological process (BP), cellular component (CC), molecular function
  (MF) and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. C, gene overlap
  analyses of differentially expressed genes and Creb3l1 target genes in KEGG pathways,
  Protein Processing in ER and Ribosome. The percentage overlap is displayed in pie
  charts for MCN enriched and K562 cell ChIP-seq datasets. D, heat map of normalised
  SON WD RNA-seq data (C1-5, control; WD1-5, water deprived) for overlapping genes
  in KEGG pathways Ribosome and Protein Processing in ER. E, immunostaining of Creb3l1
  expression in MCNs of control and WD SONs. F, relative mRNA expression was investigated
  by qRT-PCR in the SON of control compared to WD rats. G, adeno-associated virus
  constructs expressing AVPp-tdtomato (red) and OXTp-Venus (green) in the SON. H,
  immunostaining showed high levels of Creb3l1 expression in MCNs after injection
  of and AVPp-Creb3l1CA. I, relative mRNA expression by qRT-PCR in AVPp-GFP control
  virus injected and AVPp-Creb3l1CA overexpressing SONs. Values are means + SEM of
  n = 3–6 SONs per group. ∗p ≤ 0.05, ∗∗p ≤ 0.01, ∗∗∗p ≤ 0.001. Scale bars = 10 μm (E,
  I) and 100 μm (G).
