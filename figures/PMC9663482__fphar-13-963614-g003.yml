caption: Quercetin suppresses the migration and invasion of glioblastoma cells in
  vitro. (A) The migration ability of U87MG and CHG-5 cells was evaluated by wound
  healing assay. (B) Quantification of the wound closure area. (C) Cell migration
  capacity of U87MG and CHG-5 cell lines was detected by transwell assay. (D) Quantification
  of the number of migrated cells. (E) Cell invasion ability of U87MG and CHG-5 cell
  lines was detected by transwell assay. (F) Quantification of the number of invasive
  cells. All data are shown as the mean ± SD of three experiments. *p＜0.05, **p＜0.01
  or ***p＜0.001 vs. control group.
