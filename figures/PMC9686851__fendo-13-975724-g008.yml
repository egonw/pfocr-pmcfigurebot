caption: 'Effects of MCDD on serum LCN-2 content, genes of insulin signal transduction
  pathway, inflammatory factors of NF-κB inflammatory pathway, LCN-2 and NF-kB p-p65
  protein in ovarian tissue. qRT-PCR detection of gene expression of IRS-1, INSR and
  GLUT 4 in rat ovarian tissue (A) LCN-2, (B) NF-κB (C) TNF-α, (D–F) insulin signal
  transduction pathway, n=5. (G) Changes of serum LCN-2 levels in rats detected by
  enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit, n=8~12. (H) Western blot detection of p-p65,
  p65 and LCN-2 protein expression in NF-κB inflammatory pathway in rat ovarian tissue,
  n=3, the above results are expressed as mean ± SEM. ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01, *P
  < 0.05 vs. control group, ###P < 0.001, ##P < 0.01, #P <0.05, vs. model group.'
