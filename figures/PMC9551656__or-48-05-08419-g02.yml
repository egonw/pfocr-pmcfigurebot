caption: 'OTX1 increases migration and invasion of cervical cancer cells. (A) Western
  blotting of protein expression of MMP2, MMP9 and TIMP2 in cervical cancer cells.
  (B) Wound healing (scale bar, 100 µm) and (C) Transwell assay of migration of cervical
  cancer cells (scale bar, 200 µm). (D) Transwell assay of invasion of cervical cancer
  cells (scale bar, 200 µm). All experiments were performed in triplicate. *P<0.05
  vs. si-NC; #P<0.05 vs. pc-NC. OTX1, orthodenticle homolog 1; si, small interfering;
  NC, negative control; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of matrix
  metalloproteinase.'
