caption: Chemoresistance and mRNA/lncRNA expression profiles in the H69 cells and
  H69AR cells. (A) CCK-8 assays were used to determine the IC50 values of chemotherapeutic
  agents [i.e., Cisplatin (CDDP), Etoposide (VP-16), and Adriamycin (ADM)] in the
  sensitive cell line H69 and the chemoresistant cell line H69AR. (B,C) Volcano maps
  of mRNAs (B) and lncRNAs (C) in the H69 cells and H69AR cells, respectively. (D,E)
  Heat maps of mRNAs (D) and lncRNAs (E) in the H69 cells and H69AR cells, respectively.
  The data are shown as the mean Â± standard deviation from 3 independent experiments.
  *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01. mRNA, messenger RNA; lncRNA, long non-coding RNA.
