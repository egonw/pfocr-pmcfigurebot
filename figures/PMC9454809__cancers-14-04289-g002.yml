caption: The effects of endocrine therapies (SERDs, SERMs, and AIs) and CDK 4/6 inhibitors
  on the ER pathway and gene transcription. SERDs block ER function by binding to
  the complex, resulting in degradation of the ER, SERMs prevent ER function by binding
  to ER to inactivate the complex, while aromatase inhibitors block ER function by
  inhibiting the synthesis of estradiol. CDK4/6 inhibitors prevent cell cycle progression
  by blocking the formation of CDK4/6 and cyclin D complex, which leads to the inhibition
  of gene transcription.
