caption: 'The cell–cell communication between gemcitabine‐resistant and ‐sensitive
  groups. (A) Overview of the comparison of ligand–receptor interactions between gemcitabine‐resistant
  and ‐sensitive groups. Red represents the resistant group had more interactions
  than the sensitive group, otherwise blue. The line thickness was proportional to
  the number of interaction difference. (B) Barplot shows the relative proportion
  of interaction strength for each signalling pathway between gemcitabine‐resistant
  and ‐sensitive groups (R:10440; S: 31623). The top signalling pathways coloured
  red are enriched in the resistant group, and signalling pathways coloured blue are
  enriched in the sensitive group. R, resistant subtype; S, sensitive subtype. (C,
  D) Comparison of the ligand‐receptor pairs in the communication of ductal cells
  to stromal cells (C) and the communication of stromal cells to ductal cells (D)
  between gemcitabine‐resistant and ‐sensitive groups. P values are indicated by circle
  size and communication probabilities are indicated by circle colour. [Colour figure
