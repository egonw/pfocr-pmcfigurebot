caption: Starch synthesis and degradation in WT and atg5 mutant Physcomitrella colonies.
  (A) Seven-day-old WT and atg5 Physcomitrella colonies cultured on BCDAT agar medium
  were transferred to BCDATG agar medium and cultured for another 7 d. The starch
  content of colonies was measured for 7 d. (B) Seven-day-old WT and atg5 Physcomitrella
  colonies cultured on BCDATG agar medium were transferred to BCDAT agar medium and
  cultured for another 7 d under light conditions. After transfer, the starch content
  of the colonies was measured for 7 d. (A,B) Data are shown as means Â± SD (n = 3).
