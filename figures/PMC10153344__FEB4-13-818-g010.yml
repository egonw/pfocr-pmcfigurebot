caption: Dose‐dependence of hUCN1‐induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation by western blotting.
  HeLa cells were left untreated (Control) or were treated with various concentrations
  of hUCN1 (0.1–100 nm) for 15 min to induce the maximal phosphorylation of ERK1/2.
  Compared with the control group, a significant increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation
  was apparent using 10 nm of hUCN1. Reprobing of the membrane for total ERK1/2 protein
  served the purpose of loading control. Relative protein phosphorylation was determined
  by the phosphorylated/total signal ratio. The values shown are presented by box + whiskers
  plots, indicating median (central horizontal line), min/max values, and mean (with
  ‘+’ within the box) of four independently performed experiments (n = 4). *P < 0.05
  Control vs. 10 nm hUCN1 (two‐way ANOVA, Dunnett).
