caption: miR-146b inhibits FGL2 in IBD-derived macrophages. (A) TargetScan database
  and GSE42911 dataset were used to screen the target gene of miR-146b. (B) The expression
  of intersected genes in miR-146b-overexpressed cells was examined by q-PCR (C and
  D) The expression of FGL2 in IBD mice (C) and LPS-induced macrophages (D) was determined
  by q-PCR and Western blotting. (E) FGL2 expression in miR-146b-overexpressed or
  miR-146b-depleted macrophages was determined by Western blotting. (F and G) The
  correlation between miR-146b and FGL2 was investigated by Dual Luciferase reporter
  (F) and RIP (G) in 293T cells.
