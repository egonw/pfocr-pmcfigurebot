caption: 'Pathophysiological linkage between coronavirus disease 2019 and Hemolysis,
  elevated liver enzymes and low platelets syndrome. The binding of severe acute respiratory
  syndrome coronavirus 2 to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) allows its entry
  to host cells and, subsequently, downregulation. ACE2 also converts angiotensin
  II (ATII) to angiotensin 1-7. The downregulation of ACE2 increases the concentration
  of AT II, which causes activation of the p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  pathway. p38 MAPK stimulates the production of inflammatory cytokines, platelet
  aggregation and thrombosis. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and ATII are also
  involved in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes,
  and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome. Serum levels of p38 MAPK are elevated in the
  HELLP syndrome. ACE2: Angiotensin converting enzyme 2; IL: Interleukin; TNF: Tumour
  necrosis factor; HELLP: Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count;ARDS:
  Acute respiratory distress syndrome. Solid black arrow- stimulation (positive feedback),
  Dashed black arrow- inhibition (negative feedback), blue arrow: Effects of p38 MAPK
  overexpression.'
