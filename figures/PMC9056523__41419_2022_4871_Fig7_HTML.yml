figure_title: MEX3A and SCIN regulate NPC likely via the NF-κB signaling pathway
caption: A The major components of the NF-κB pathway in shCtrl and shMEX3A stable
  C666-1 and HONE-1 cell lines were detected by western blotting. B, C The effects
  of treatment with NF-κB inhibitor QNZ (EVP4593) on MEX3A (B) or SCIN (C) overexpression
  in human C666-1 and HONE-1 NPC cells were determined by western blotting. D, E The
  effects of QNZ compared with those of negative control (DMSO) on the proliferation
  of C666-1 and HONE-1 cells with or without MEX3A (D) or SCIN (E) overexpression
  were detected by CCK-8 assay. F, G The impact of QNZ on the migration and invasion
  abilities of indicated cells with or without MEX3A (F) or SCIN (G) overexpression
  was measured by Transwell assay. H, I The impact of QNZ on the apoptosis rates of
  indicated cells with or without MEX3A (F) or SCIN (G) overexpression was measured
  by flow cytometry. The results are presented as mean ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001.
