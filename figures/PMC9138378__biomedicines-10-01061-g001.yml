caption: 'Crosstalk between HER2 pathway and immune signalling. HER2 signalling activates
  the AKT→ NF-κB axis, which stimulates: (a) production of inflammatory cytokines
  and infiltration of immune cells; (b) increase of PD-L1 expression; and (c) maintenance
  of stem cell phenotype. All those phenomena may also confer proliferative dominance
  of HER2-negative cells, leading to HER2-negative invasive recurrence/progression.'
