caption: 'MiR-34c activated the inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in LPS-treated
  cells. (A) Representative Western blot bands of p-PI3K/PI3K and p-AKT/AKT in LPS-treated
  H441 cells transfected with miR-34c mimic. (B,C) Graphical representation of data
  obtained from Western blot assays for p-PI3K/PI3K and p-AKT/AKT. Bands were quantified
  by using gray analysis (p-PI3K/PI3K and p-AKT/AKT) (n = 4). (D) Representative Western
  blot bands of p-PI3K/PI3K and p-AKT/AKT in LPS-treated H441 cells transfected with
  miR-34c inhibitor and si-MARCKS. (E,F) Graphical representation of data obtained
  from Western blot assays for p-PI3K/PI3K and p-AKT/AKT. Bands were quantified by
  using gray analysis (p-PI3K/PI3K and p-AKT/AKT) (n = 4). Note: * p < 0.05, *** p
  < 0.001, compared with Control; &p < 0.05, &&p < 0.01, &&&p < 0.001, compared with
  LPS and in-NC + si-NC + LPS; ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001, compared with in + si-NC
  + LPS; $$$p < 0.001, compared with in-NC + si-MARCKS + LPS.'
