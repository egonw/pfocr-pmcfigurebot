caption: 'Expression level of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway-related proteins after
  overexpression of hsa_circ_0087302. (A) The protein levels of β-catenin, cyclin
  D1, Dvl 2, Dvl 3, CD44, LRP 6, LEF 1, c-Myc and c-Jun were downregulated by lentiviral
  transduction in MG63 and U2OS cells, while the protein level of Axin was increased.
  GAPDH was used as a loading control. The bar chart shows the expression level of
  each protein in MG63 (B) and U2OS (C) cells compared to control cells. NC: negative
  control. Data represent the mean ± SD (n = 3) (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P <
  0.001).'

  via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
