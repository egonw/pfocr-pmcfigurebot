caption: Distribution of animals in individual health states in the model for the
  spread of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis in a typical Slovenian dairy
  herd. (A) Number of animals in individual health states. (B) Flow diagram of the
  model showing the proportion of cows in each health state out of the total number
  of dairy cows in a herd and the proportion of young female calves and heifers in
  the two young animal states (mean Â± standard deviation). The possible reinfections
  and spontaneous eliminations (mean per herd/year) are marked with dashed lines.
  Susceptible cows (Sa); susceptible young (Sy); latent young (Ly); latent cows on
  low shedding pathway (Ll); latent cows on high shedding pathway (Lh); infected cows
  on low shedding pathway (Il); infected cows on high shedding pathway (Ih); high
  shedders (H).

  of Slovenia Suggests That Different Models Should Be Used to Study Disease Spread
  in Herds of Different Sizes.
