caption: 'Fatty acid metabolism in GC. Citrate by TCA enters the cytoplasm and is
  converted to acetyl-CoA by ACLY, then ACC converts acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA
  is used by FASN as a direct substrate for the DNL to synthesize saturated fatty
  acids (usually PA). SCD1 is capable of converting saturated fatty acids to MUFAs.
  ACSs play two main roles in fatty acid metabolism: one is to convert free fatty
  acids to acetyl-CoA, thus participating in fatty acid synthesis; the other is to
  convert fatty acids to FA-CoA to be transferred to mitochondria by CPT1 for further
  oxidative catabolism. SREBP1 regulates the expression of ACLY, ACC, FASN, SCD1,
  and ACSs at the transcriptional level. CD36 and FABPs are responsible for the uptake
  of exogenous PA, involved in fatty acid metabolic processes in the cytoplasm. In
  gastric cancer, FASN promotes the mTOR/Gli1 pathway, SCD1 promotes the Hippo/YAP
  pathway, CD36 promotes the DEK/AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin pathway, FABPs promote the SP1/UCA1
  pathway, and HCP5 targets miR-3619-5p to upregulate PPARGC1A, leading to the transactivation
  of CPT1 by the PGC1α/CEBPB complex. SREBP1: sterol regulatory element-binding protein
  1; ACLY: ATP citrate lyase; ACC: acetyl-CoA carboxylase; FASN: fatty acid synthase;
  SCD1: stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1; MUFAs: monounsaturated FAs; ACSs: acetyl-CoA synthases;
  H2S: hydrogen sulfide; C75: an inhibitor of FASN; A939572: an inhibitor of SCD1;
  CoA: coenzyme A; Fas: fatty acids; PA: palmitic acid; FAO: fatty acid oxidation;
  TAC: tricarboxylic acid cycle.'
