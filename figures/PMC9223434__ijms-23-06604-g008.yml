caption: 'Parameter rankings for IFN--induced JAK/STAT signaling pathway model: based
  on sensitivity functions (top panel) and based on the method proposed in this paper
  (bottom panel). The horizontal (X) axis represents consecutive model parameters,
  whose names have been replaced by numbers for better readability. The parameter
  annotation associated with these numbers is given in . The red line in the lower
  panel corresponds to the A index value representing no influence of parameter changes
  on the model response. Points located above this line represent parameters whose
  change (as described in the algorithm details) amplify the model response, while
  those below represent the parameters whose change lead to the suppression of the
  model response.'
