caption: 'Rod and cone system responses from a patient with unilateral CRAO (A–F),
  and cone-driven responses from a male patient with NYX deletion (G–I). Stimuli are
  as in , with the same method of rod and cone isolation. (A–C) Rod system–isolated
  responses from a patient with CRAO. In the CRAO eye, inner retinal layers have degenerated
  but photoreceptors are intact: The a-waves are similar between eyes, reflecting
  intact rods, but b-waves differ, due to loss of inner retinal neurons. (D–F) Cone
  system responses from the same patient. As well as expected differences in b-waves
  due to loss of inner retinal layers, a-wave amplitudes also differ markedly, consistent
  with a postreceptoral origin of a substantial fraction of the cone-driven a-wave.
  (G–I) Cone-driven responses to the same flash strengths from a patient with selective
  loss of ON-bipolar cell signals. The b-wave is severely attenuated in the responses
  shown (particularly brighter flashes), indicating that the normal b-wave elicited
  by these stimuli in healthy individuals is from the ON pathway. The dashed trace
  shows standard LA 3 response in this patient (same stimulus as in ): A b-wave is
  present, indicating that for this stimulus, OFF-bipolar cells do contribute to the
  b-wave.'
