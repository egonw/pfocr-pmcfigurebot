caption: Western blotting analysis of PI3K and Akt in PD- and CTX-treated cells. (A)
  Western blot images. The left column shows protein names, including p-PI3K, PI3K,
  p-Akt, Akt, and β-actin, which was used as loading control. The top row shows two
  cell lines HCT116 and LoVo, and drug treatment with different combinations. (B)
  Bar plots of densitometric analysis. Protein expression levels are normalized to
  that of the loading control. Columns show the mean ± S.D. One-way ANOVA was used
  to analyze P values between groups. All groups are compared with the ‘Control’ group,
  the ‘CTX’ group is compared with the ‘CTX+PD’ group. *P < 0.05 represents a significant
  difference.
