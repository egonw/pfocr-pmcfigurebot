caption: Knocking down ILK can improve H9C2 inflammatory response induced by high
  glucose. (a) Immunofluorescence was performed to examine the expression of IL-α.
  (b) Protein expression results of IL-1β were determined by Western blotting. β-Actin
  was used as an internal control. (c–e) The levels of MPO, IL-1β, and IL-8 in the
  supernatant were determined by the ELISA. (f–h) mRNA expression results of MPO,
  IL-1β, and IL-8 were determined by real-time PCR. (“∗” indicates statistical difference
  from the control group P < 0.05, and “#” indicates statistical difference from the
  HG group P < 0.05.).
