caption: RNAseq analysis and validation. RNAseq analysis was conducted in four groups
  (Fresh/Control, 7 d/18 °C, 28 d/12 °C and 28 d/18 °C) with four replicates each.
  (A) Pathway enrichment analysis between 28 d/12 °C and 28 d/12 °C group. (B) Heat
  map of gene sets of embryos in different diapause conditions. (C) A schematic representation
  of enriched cell cycle pathway, as obtained by KEGG pathway analysis of DEGs between
  28 d/12 °C and 28 d/12 °C group. The enriched gene sets are marked in red. An expanded
  scheme of enriched pathway is showed in . (D) The expression of key genes involved
  in cell cycle was validated by using real−time PCR analysis. The expression level
  of target genes of each sample was normalized to that of GAPDH. The gene expression
  level (folds) is the GAPDH−normalized expression of target genes of 7 d/18 °C, 28
  d/12 °C and 28 d/18 °C group relative to that of fresh (control) group. (one−way
  ANOVA; * p = 0.02; ** p = 0.0096).
