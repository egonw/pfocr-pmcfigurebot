figure_title: The insulin pathway is involved in the regulation of the miRNA-target
  axis
caption: (A-D) Effects of enhanced insulin activity on the miRNA-target axis under
  yeast-rich conditions (yeast+). (A) The relative transcription levels of InR and
  4EBP at 24 h post insulin injection. (B) ELISA was employed to quantify the relative
  insulin content, including the sum of exogenous insulin and insect-produced insulin.
  (C-D) The relative expression levels of miRNAs (C) and target genes (D) following
  insulin microinjection. (E-H) Effects of inhibiting the insulin signaling pathway
  gene IRS on the miRNA-target axis. (E) The relative expression levels of IRS and
  4EBP at 2 day post dsIRS treatment. (F) The endogenous insulin titers were detected
  by ELISA. (G-H) Effects of dsRNA treatment on miRNAs (G) and target genes (H) transcript
  levels in whole bodies. (I-L) The role of the TOR pathway in the miRNA-target axis.
  (I) Consumption of yeast-rich foods increases TOR transcription. (J-L) Relative
  expressions of TOR (J), miRNAs (K), and target genes (L) in the whole bodies at
  2 day post dsTOR injection. Data are expressed as means ± SEM. *, P < 0.05; **,
  P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001 (Student’s t-test).
