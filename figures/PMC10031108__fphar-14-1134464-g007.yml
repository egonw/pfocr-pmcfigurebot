caption: 'Myricetin exerted neuroprotection through the activation of NRF2 pathway.
  (A) The protein bands of T-NRF2, N-NRF2, KEAP1, NQO-1, and HO-1 were detected by
  Western blot in PC12 from each group. (B) Quantitative analysis of Western blot
  bands (n = 4 per group). (C) The representative immunofluorescence staining images
  of NRF2 (red) in PC12 from each group. Nucleus were stained with DAPI (blue). (D)
  The representative immunofluorescence staining images of HO-1 (red) in PC12 from
  each group. The data are presented as mean ± SD. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
  Scale bar: 10 μm.'
