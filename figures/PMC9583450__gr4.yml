caption: 'Experiment 5: RNA-sequencing of total RNA from plantaris muscle of HSA-Myc
  mice following a single pulse of Myc.A, PCA plots from doxycycline-treated HSA-Myc
  versus littermate HSA-rtTA (Control) mice (generated using DESeq2 normalized gene
  counts). B, pathway analysis of upregulated genes after Myc overexpression. C, Rpl3
  mRNA levels after Myc overexpression. D, genes upregulated by Myc in muscle and
  also enriched in myonuclei during 72 h of overload. E, Myh2 mRNA levels after Myc
  overexpression. F, Reverbα (Nr1d1) and Reverbβ (Nr1d2) after Myc overexpression.
  G, genes upregulated by Myc in muscle also enriched in myonuclei during 72 h of
  overload. OV, overload; PCA, principal component analysis.'

  stimulus yields tools for discerning global and MYC regulatory networks.
