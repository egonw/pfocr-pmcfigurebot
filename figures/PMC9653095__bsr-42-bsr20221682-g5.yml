figure_title: Proposed IDO/TDO-AhR-SLC7A5 axis
caption: 'Abbrevations: AhR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor; IDO, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase;
  IL, interleukin; KA, kynurenic acid; Kyn, kynurenine; SLC7A5, solute carrier transporter
  7A5; TDO, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase. Induction of IDO by proinflammatory cytokines
  and/or of TDO by cortisol activates the kynurenine pathway leading to increased
  production of kynurenine and its consequent transamination to kynurenic acid. KA
  activates the AhR, which in turn up-regulates the neutral amino acid transporter
  SLC7A5. Two interleukins are known to enhance expression of this transporter, whereas
  cortisol may exert the opposite effect.'
