caption: 'UGCG expression is increased in the pressure overload heart. A, B Western
  blot assays showed the expression level of UGCG at different time points and corresponding
  statistical analysis histogram. C, D Immunofluorescence staining showed the expression
  of UGCG in different heart groups and corresponding statistical analysis diagrams.
  E, F Western blot assays showed the expression level of UGCG in primary cardiomyocytes
  in vitro and corresponding statistical analysis histogram. G, H Immunofluorescence
  staining showed the expression of UGCG in primary cardiomyocytes in vitro and corresponding
  statistical analysis histogram. N = 6, *p < 0.05. UGCG: UDP-glucose ceramide glycosyltransferase;
  TAC: Transverse aortic constriction; PE: Phenylephrine'
article_title: UGCG modulates heart hypertrophy through B4GalT5-mediated mitochondrial
  oxidative stress and the ERK signaling pathway.
