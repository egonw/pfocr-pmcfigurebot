caption: (a) At the translocon (brown cylinder), the pore is gated by BiP, which,
  in its ADP-bound form, closes the gate and opens it in its ATP-bound form. Translational
  arrest occurs when BiP dissociates from the luminal domains of ERdj1, ERdj2, and
  PERK. The release of BiP from PERK results in the dimerization of PERK, its autophosphorylation,
  and the subsequent phosphorylation of eIF2α (p-eIF2α), which inhibits eIF2α-dependent
  translation. (b) The translation of proteins is controlled by the co-chaperones
  ERdj1, ERdj2/Sec62, and ERdj6. In their BiP-bound forms, ERdj1 and ERdj2/Sec62 enable
  protein synthesis. The silencing of PERK and the PERK-signaling pathway occur by
  the binding of BiP to its luminal domain, which results in the release of eIF2α-dependent
  translation and protein synthesis. BiP, immunoglobin binding protein; PERK, protein
  kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase; eIF2α, alpha subunit of eukaryotic
  initiation factor 2.
