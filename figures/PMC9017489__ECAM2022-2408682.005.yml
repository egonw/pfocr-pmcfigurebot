caption: 'miR-584-5p regulated mTOR and the NF-κB signaling pathway in lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS)-stimulated HBE cells. Representative western blot of mTOR, p65, and p-p65
  expression in mimicNC-, mimic584-, inhibitorNC-, and inhibitor584-transfected HBE
  cells after LPS treatment. The expression of GAPDH, p65, p-p65, and mTOR was analyzed
  using western blotting.  ∗p < 0.05 compared with the mimicNC and mimic584 groups;
  #p < 0.05 compared with the mimicNC, mimic584, and mimicNC + LPS groups.  ∗p < 0.05
  compared with the inhibitorNC, inhibitor584, and inhibitorNC + LPS groups; #p < 0.05
  compared with the inhibitor584, inhibitorNC + LPS, and inhibitor584 + LPS groups.
  The experiments were performed at least three times independently. Data are presented
  as mean ± standard deviation (SD).'
