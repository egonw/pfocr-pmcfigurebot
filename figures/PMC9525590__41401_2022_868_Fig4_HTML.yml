figure_title: CftrPOE reduces thrombosis in vivo and decreases aggregation and ATP
  release in vitro
caption: a Representative images and time courses of FeCl3-induced mesenteric arteriole
  thrombus formation in CftrPOE and Ctrl mice. Time after FeCl3-induced injury is
  indicated at the low right corner of each image. Scale bars, 500 μm. b Summary of
  the time to first thrombi and maximal thrombus size of arterioles from the result
  of FeCl3-induced thrombosis in CftrPOE and Ctrl mice in Fig. 4a. (n = 8 or 9 mice
  per group; unpaired t test). c–g Aggregation or ATP release of washed CftrPOE and
  Ctrl platelets were stimulated with different concentrations of ADP (2.5, 5, or
  10 μM) (c), thrombin (0.01, 0.02, or 0.05 U/mL) (d, e) and collagen (0.5 μg/mL)
  (f, g) at 37 °C under constant stirring. Representative tracings (left) and quantification
  graphs (right) are presented (n = 5–7 mice per group; unpaired t test). Data are
  presented as mean ± SEM; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ****P < 0.0001. ns not significant
