caption: 'CD155 represents a prognostic biomarker in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
  (A) The analysis of differential expression of CD155 in The Cancer Genome Atlas‐liver
  hepatocellular carcinoma (TCGA‐LIHC) was performed by the UALCAN database. (B) The
  analysis of overall survival (OS) of CD155 in TCGA‐LIHC was performed by the Human
  Protein Atlas database. (C) CD155 was highly expressed in tumour tissues compared
  with adjacent tissues. Representative immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining images
  of CD155 expression in tumour tissues and adjacent tissues in tissue microarrays
  (TMAs) (n = 189) are shown. Scale bar: 50 μm. (D) Correlation between CD155 expression
  and clinicopathological characteristics of HCC patients in TMAs (n = 189); chi‐square
  tests and Fisher''s exact tests were used. (E) Kaplan–Meier analysis of OS and time
  to recurrence (TTR) of 189 HCC patients according to CD155 expression level; log‐rank
  tests were used. (F and G) Kaplan–Meier analysis of OS and TTR of HCC patients in
  low recurrent risk subgroups (AFP ≤400 ng/ml and CNLC stage I); log‐rank tests were
  used'
