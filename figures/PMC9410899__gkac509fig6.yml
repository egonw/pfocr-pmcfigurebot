caption: RBFOX2 regulates the expression of target genes related to the Hippo signaling
  pathway. (A) Transient transfection of HEK293A cells with the 8 × GT-IIC luciferase
  construct and the increasing amounts of RBFOX2-Flag in the absence or presence of
  Flag-YAP. After 48 h, Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to that of Renilla
  luciferase. (B) Transient transfection of HEK293A cells with the increasing amounts
  of RBFOX2-Flag in the absence or presence of Flag-YAP. After 48 h, mRNA levels of
  the indicated genes were measured using qRT-PCR and normalized to β-actin level.
  (C) Transient transfection of HEK293A cells with 8 × GT-IIC luciferase along with
  non-targeting control siRNA or two individual siRNAs targeting RBFOX2 in the absence
  or presence of Flag-YAP. (D) Transient transfection of HEK293A cells with non-targeting
  control siRNA or two individual siRNAs targeting RBFOX2 in the absence or presence
  of Flag-YAP. (E) Transient transfection of WT and LATS1/2-DKO HEK293A cells with
  8xGT-IIC luciferase with the increasing amount of RBFOX2-Flag. (F) Transient transfection
  of WT and LATS1/2-DKO HEK293A cells with the increasing amount of RBFOX2-Flag. (G)
  Transient transfection of WT and LATS1/2-DKO HEK293A cells with 8 × GT-IIC luciferase
  with non-targeting control siRNA or two individual siRNAs targeting RBFOX2. (H)
  Transient transfection of WT and LATS1/2-DKO HEK293A cells with non-targeting control
  siRNA or two individual siRNAs targeting RBFOX2. (–) in the graph means mock vector
  (A, B, E, F) or non-targeting control siRNA (C, D, G, H) transfection. All data
  are expressed as fold values relative to the sample transfected with the mock vector
  into HEK293A WT cells. Data represent the mean ± SD (n = 3); *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001.
