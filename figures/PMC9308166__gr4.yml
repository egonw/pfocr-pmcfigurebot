caption: Conditioning lesions significantly enhance CNS cortical neurite growth(A–E)
  The spinal cord was lesioned at C8; the motor cortex was then removed and cultured
  either (A) 1 h, (B) 6 h, (C) 24 h, (D) 72 h, or (E) 7 days later. All cells were
  then maintained for 5 days in culture. An increase in neurite length is particularly
  appreciable in cultures prepared 24 h after conditioning. Tuj1 label for neurons.
  Scale bar, 20 μm. Images of neurons were placed onto equal-sized background panels
  for presentation purposes.(F and G) Total neurite length and (G) longest neurite
  length measured using Tuj1 labeling. N = 3 replicates, ± SEM There is a significant
  conditioning effect beginning 1 h after spinal cord injury and lasting 24 h.(H)
  RNA sequencing of conditioned neuronal cultures. Spinal cord lesions were made 24 h
  before plating cells, and RNA sequencing was performed after 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 days
  in culture. Number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) compared with non-conditioned
  cultures sampled at the same number of days in culture are shown. FDR ≤0.1.(I) Heatmap
  of top 1,000 differentially expressed genes (FDR ≤0.1, Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted
  p values) of conditioned relative to non-conditioned neurons at 1, 2, 3, 5, and
  7 days in culture, arranged by hierarchical clustering. Red, increased expression;
  green, reduced expression. Intensity of color reflects degree of gene differential
  expression compared to non-conditioned cultures.(J) Pathway analysis of differentially
  expressed genes over days 1 to 7 in culture. The most significant clusters of transcription
  factor genes were related to embryonic development, cell morphology, and cell growth
  and proliferation, suggesting conversion of the cell to an immature growth state.
  State of activity of signaling pathway is represented by Z score (right-tailed Fisher
  exact test). Red, activation; green, inhibition. Scaling parameters listed at bottom
  right. n = 3 biological replicates for each day and condition.(K) Pathway analysis
  supports the emergence of a stem cell-like transcriptional state after 5–7 days
  in culture.(L) On the very earliest days of culture, cells exhibit marked elevations
  in cell metabolic, anti-oxidant and glycolytic pathways, indicating an abrupt transition
  to a state that may foster cell survival after removal from the brain. This state
  rapidly diminishes.(M), General signaling pathways show early reductions in many
  trophic and guidance pathways, followed by their recovery starting approximately
  3 days after culture as cells extend neurites and form synapses.
