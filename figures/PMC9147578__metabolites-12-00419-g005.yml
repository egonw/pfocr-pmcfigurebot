caption: Metabolic pathways affected in MetS5 in all groups. Venn diagram of the metabolites
  identified as altered in MetS.5 with respect to MHO in the different age and sex
  groups, and pathway enrichment analysis of all groupsâ€™ intersections and the metabolic
  specific for men older than 54. For each subgroup (represented by ovals of different
  colors) is shown the number of the metabolites that are common to two, three or
  all the four groups (where ovals overlap) or those that are exclusive to each group
  (outer ovals). Metabolic pathway enrichment analysis for metabolites common to all
  groups (left, grey background) and exclusive for men over 54 years old (right, pink
  background) are also represented. Metabolic pathways whose name is indicated are
  significant (p-value lower than 0.05 after the adjustment using Holm-Bonferroni
  method and False Discovery Rate) and have a pathway impact value, calculated from
  pathway topology analysis, over 0. The x-axis indicates the impact on the route,
  while the y-axis indicates significant changes to a route. The pathways are represented
  as circles. The circle color indicates the significance level, from highest (red)
  to lowest (white) in the enrichment analysis. The circle size is proportional to
  the impact value of each road from the topology analysis.
