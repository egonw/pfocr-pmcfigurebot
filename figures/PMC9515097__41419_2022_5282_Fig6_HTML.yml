figure_title: HSF2BP regulates HSP70/MAPK pathway by binding to HSF2
caption: Primary hepatocytes were isolated and treated with 5 mM APAP. A immunofluorescent
  staining of HSF2 and HSF2BP at 6 h after APAP administration. Primary hepatocytes
  were pretreated with HSP70 siRNA. B–F Western blot analysis of the expression of
  Jnk1/2, p-Jnk1/2, P38, p-P38, p-MKK4, and p-cJunS73 in 5 mM APAP-treated hepatocytes.
  ns. means no difference, n = 6, mean ± SEM. The t-test was used to analyze the differences
  between the two groups. G HSF2BP protects against liver injury by regulating HSF2/HSP70/MAPK
  signaling.
