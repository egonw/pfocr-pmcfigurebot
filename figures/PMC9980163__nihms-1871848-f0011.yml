figure_title: In vivo screening of FIND-seq-identified candidate regulators of XBP1+
  astrocytes
caption: '(a) Predicted upstream regulator analysis showing Nr3c2 and Xbp1 from bulk
  FIND-seq data using Qiagen IPA. Differentially expressed genes were used as input
  and the overlap with the regulon controlled by each molecule was computed. Fisher’s
  exact test. (b) Left: Prediction of Nr3c2 as an upstream regulator in Aqp4+Edem1+
  cells analyzed by FIND-seq during EAE using Qiagen IPA as in (a). Fisher’s exact
  test. Right: Identification of an NR3C2 motif by SeqPos in genes downregulated in
  Aqp4+Edem1+ versus Aqp4+Edem1− cells in EAE. (c) UMAP plot of Aqp4+Edem1+ cells
  from EAE mice analyzed by scFIND-seq. (d–e) Prediction of upstream regulators (d)
  and pathway analysis (e) based on Qiagen IPA in Cluster 1 astrocytes analyzed from
  Aqp4+Edem1+ cells in EAE mice shown in (c). Fisher’s exact test. (f) Schematic of
  lentiviral vector containing a sgRNA targeting candidate genes and spCas9 under
  the control of a Gfap promoter. EAE disease progression in mice transduced with
  sgScrmbl and candidate sgRNA lentiviruses. n = 4–5 mice per condition.'
