caption: GS mediated nucleotide synthesis sustains the stem‐like characteristics of
  cancer cells in glutamine deficiency. A,B) Metabolite cluster gram and metabolic
  pathway enrichment analysis of OCT4‐GFP (+) and OCT4‐GFP (−) cells selected by FACS
  from Huh7 cells, cultured in medium without glutamine for 12 h (n = 3). C) Metabolite
  cluster gram and metabolic pathway enrichment analysis of GFP (+) cells selected
  by FACS from control and GS knock‐down Huh7 cells, cultured in medium without glutamine
  for 12 h (n = 3). D) Metabolite cluster gram and metabolic pathway enrichment analysis
  of GS higher and lower expression cells selected by FACS from primary patient liver
  cancer cells. E) Sphere formation assay of control and GS knock‐down Huh7 cells
  in culture medium with supplement of glutamine (2 × 10−3 m) or nucleotides (containing
  AGCTU, 0.2 × 10−3 m each). Spheres (diameter > 100 µm) counted on day 12 (n = 6).
  The significant different metabolites were determined based on the combination of
  a statistically significant threshold of variable influence on projection (VIP)
  values obtained from PLS‐DA model and two‐tailed Student's t test (p value) on the
  raw data, and the metabolites with VIP values larger than 1.0 and p values less
  than 0.1 were considered as significant. The data are shown in (F) as the mean values
  ± SD, p values are based on Student's t test. ***p < 0.001.
