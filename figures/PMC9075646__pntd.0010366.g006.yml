figure_title: NS4A enhanced ISGs expression by activating ISGF3 pathway in HMC3 cells
caption: (a) Venn Diagram of differentially expressed genes. After HMC3 cells with
  or without NS4A expression were infected with 0.1 MOI of ZIKV/SZ01 for 24 h, total
  RNA from the mock and virus infected cells were collected for RNA-Seq, followed
  by analyses of the differentially expressed genes. Vec-M or Vec-S, mock or ZIKV/SZ01
  infected- HMC3 cells without NS4A expression; NS4A-M or NS4A-S, mock or ZIKV/SZ01
  infected-group of HMC3 cells with NS4A expression. (b) Expression of ISGs in HMC3
  cells expressing NS4A determined by RNA-Seq. (c) Expression of ISGs in HMC3 cells
  expressing NS4A verified by qRT-PCR. The differences between groups of control and
  NS4A were evaluated by two-tailed Student’s t test. Data are means ± SEM of triplicate
  experiments; *, P < 0.05; **, P< 0.01; ***, p < 0.001. (d) The top 20 enriched pathways
  of Vec-M vs NS4A-M. The pathway enrichment analysis was used to group the differentially
  expressed genes in HMC3 cells expressing NS4A and vector. (e) Detection of STAT1,
  p-STAT1 (Tyr701), STAT2, p-STAT2 (Tyr690) and IRF9 protein expression in the ISGF3
  signaling pathway in HMC3 cells expressing NS4A by western blot analyses.
