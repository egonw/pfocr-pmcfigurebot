caption: Mechanism of action of hawthorn in the protection against cardiovascular
  disease. (1). Alcoholic extract of Crataegus oxyacantha (AEC) pretreatment maintained
  mitochondrial antioxidant status and prevented mitochondrial lipid per-oxidative
  damage and decrease in Krebs cycle enzymes induced by isoproterenol in rat heart.;
  AEC can act on myocardial tissue to reduce iNOS expression and downregulate COX-2
  to exert anti-inflammatory effects. (2). Hawthorn extract WS1442 increases contractility
  and increases positive muscle strength by inhibiting the Na+/K+-ATPase pump; WS1442
  acts at the serine 1177 site to phosphorylate eNOS and increase NO-mediated vasodilatation;
  WS1442 effectively protects the vascular endothelium by inhibiting the Ca/PKC/Rho
  A pathway and activating the cAMP/Epaci/Rap1 pathway. (3). Hawthorn flavonoids exert
  hypolipidemic effects by acting on the PPARÎ³ pathway to increase LDL expression
  in blood vessels. (4). High doses of hawthorn ginsenoside can cause significant
  reductions in heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP), and induce sinus
  node.
