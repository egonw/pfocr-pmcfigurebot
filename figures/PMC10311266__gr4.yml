caption: TRAF7 negatively regulates RLR-mediated signaling by targeting TBK1. A TRAF7
  inhibits the activation of IFN-β promoter and ISRE by targeting TBK1. HEK 293 ​cells
  (1 ​× ​105) were transfected with the indicated plasmids for 20 ​h before luciferase
  analysis. B TRAF7 impairs the TBK1-mediated dimerization of IRF3. HEK 293 ​cells
  (2 ​× ​105) were transfected with TRAF7 (dose) and TBK1 for 20 ​h before immunoblotting
  analysis. (∗∗P ​< ​0.01; ns, no signiﬁcant difference).
