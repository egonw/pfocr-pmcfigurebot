caption: IL-23 activated the EMT signaling pathway. (A) The morphology of MC-38 cells
  after incubation (48 h) with MDSCs-CM, IL-23, anti-IL-23+MDSCs-CM, respectively.
  (B) Representative images of wound healing assay of MC-38 cells. (C) Representative
  images of invasive MC-38 cells. (D) The expression of N-cadherin, E-cadherin, Snail,
  Slug, Twist, Stat3, and P-stat3 in MC-38 cells detected by Western blot. (B–D) Data
  were presented as the mean ± SD; p-values were determined by one-way analysis of
  variance. Three independent experiments were performed with consistent results.
