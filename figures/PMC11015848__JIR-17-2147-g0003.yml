caption: 'LPS aggravated the neuroinflammatory response in TBI rats. (A) Compared
  to the Sham and Sham+LPS groups, we observed lighter staining of the extracellular
  matrix, increased brain tissue swelling, and increased nuclear staining in the TBI
  group. Additionally, compared to the TBI group alone, the TBI+LPS group showed increased
  occurrence of hemorrhage. Blue arrows indicate deeply stained cell nuclei, red blood
  cells are indicated by red arrows. (B) Compared to the Sham group and Sham+LPS group,
  the concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in brain tissue exhibited an upward
  trend in the TBI group, while IL-10 showed a contrasting trend. The neuroinflammatory
  response was more severe in the TBI+LPS group compared to the TBI group (mean ±
  SD values are presented; n = 3/group; *P < 0.05 vs Sham group; # P < 0.05 vs TBI
  group; &P < 0.05 vs Sham+LPS group; scale = 50 nm).'
