caption: Improvements of SBP and TSP to H2O2-induced PC-12 cells’ mitochondrial dysfunction.
  100 μg/mL of SBP and TSP was used to treat cells for 48 h and followed with exposure
  of 250 μM H2O2 for 40 min. Seahorse XFe24 Analyzer was the instrument to test OCR.
  (A,B) Mitochondrial respiration profile in cells with different treatments. (C)
  Basic respiration. (D) Production of ATP. (E) The capacity of spare respiratory.
  (F) Maximum respiration. (G) Coupling efficiency. (H) The ratio of OCR/ECAR. Data
  are expressed as the means ± SD (n = 3), results marked with different letters (a,
  b and c) are significantly different (p < 0.05).
