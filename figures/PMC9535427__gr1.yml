caption: 'Expansion of SIRPα in patients with PTB compared with HCs. (a) Hierarchical
  clustering of transcripts expression profiles of the meta-analysis from the six
  used microarrays (Upper panel). Clustering of all the transcripts in HC and PTB
  samples. The numbers below the image refer to the various experimental regimens
  described in Supplementary Table 1. KEGG pathway enrichment for the identified differential
  targets from the meta-analysis (Lower panel). The red boxes indicate the immune
  system process-related genes. (b) Clustering of all the immune system process-related
  genes in HC and PTB samples. (c) qRT-PCR assay showing the differential expressing
  patterns of the genes described in (b) among 15 PTB patients, 15 NSCLC patients,
  and 15 HCs (MX2, CD74 and NCKAP1L Mann-Whitney U-test, others student t-test). (d)
  Western-blotting assay showing the expansion of SIRPα in PBMCs samples (student
  t-test) and BALs samples (Mann-Whitney U-test) between 203 PTB patients and 90 HCs.
  (e) Flow cytometry assay showing the expansion of SIRPα in CD14+ monocytes/macrophages
  obtained from PBMCs (student t-test) and BALs (student t-test) samples between 203
  PTB patients and 90 HCs. (f) Flow cytometry assay showing SIRPα expression of blood
  CD14+ monocytes/macrophages were higher in active PTB patients (n=203) than in latent
  TB (n =23) cases (left panel, student t-test) and NSCLC (n =29) and PA (n=23) patients
  (middle panel, student t-test), but not significantly different with extra-PTB (n
  =36) patients (right panel, Mann-Whitney U-test). (g-h) The 203 PTB inpatients were
  followed regularly over the next six months, and their (g) survival curves and (h)
  culture-positive curves and cough-positive curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier
  method. Red curve: H group; Blue curve: L group.PTB: pulmonary tuberculosis; HCs:
  healthy controls; NSCLC: non-small cell lung cancer; PA: pneumonia; extra-PTB: extrapulmonary
  tuberculosis.Results are shown as means ± SD of three experiments.'
