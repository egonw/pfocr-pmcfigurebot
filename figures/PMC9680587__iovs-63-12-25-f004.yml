caption: 'The decrease of DJ-1/Nrf2/NQO1 expression and Nrf2 nuclear translocation
  in HCECs of the HG group after exposed to 5 J/cm2 UVA indicates its insufficiency
  of antioxidant capacity. (A) Representative q-PCR of DJ-1/Nrf2/NQO1 mRNA levels
  (n = 3). (B) Representative Western blot of DJ-1/Nrf2/p-Nrf2/NQO1 protein levels
  (n = 3). Data are shown as mean ± SD; P < 0.05. The * represents the statistical
  difference between the LG group and any of the other three groups. The # represents
  the statistical difference between the HG + UVA group and any of the other three
  groups. DJ-1, Parkinson''s disease protein 7; Nrf2, nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related
  factor 2; p-Nrf2, phosphorylated Nrf2; NQO1, NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1; HCECs,
  human corneal endothelial cells; HG, high glucose; UVA, ultraviolet A; LG, low glucose;
  SD, standard deviation.'
