caption: 'Effects of FST on the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway in lung tissue of rats
  with PH. (A) The effect of FST on the expression of JAK2-STAT3 and SOCS1 in lung
  tissue of rats with PH, as detected by immunohistochemistry. 400× before amplification;
  1,000× in small box. The blue arrow indicates the magnified area. (B) The effect
  of FST on the expression of JAK2-STAT3 and SOCS1 in lung tissue of rats with PH,
  as detected by western blot. Sildenafil as a positive control group. Compared with
  the model group, *, P<0.05, **, P<0.01, ***, P<0.001; compared with the control
  group, #, P<0.05, ##, P<0.01. FST, total flavones from Sceptridium ternatum; PH,
  pulmonary hypertension.'
