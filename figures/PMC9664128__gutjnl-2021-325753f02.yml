caption: Association between microbiome biotin status and host metabolic and inflammation
  markers in the MetaCardis subcohort. Heatmap indicating adjusted associations between
  log-10 transformed QMP abundance profiles of metagenomic signatures regarding biotin
  production and transport with clinical and lifestyle factors. The y-axis represents
  independent variables and the variables in the x-axis are the dependent variable
  (n=1545 individuals). These models were adjusted for the country of recruitment
  and age. (*P value<0.05; **FDR<0.05. Clinical and lifestyle variables for which
  no association with FDR<0.05 was found are not included in the heatmap). The color
  tones correspond to effect sizes represented by standardized beta coefficients from
  the adjusted linear regression models. Biosynthesis and transport genome groups
  were defined according to the nomenclature defined in Rodionov et al. Briefly, these
  included 3 groups of strict biotin producers (P1, P2, P* groups) harboring all 4
  genes common to the different pathway variants of biotin biosynthesis from pimelate
  (P2) or pimeloyl-ACP (P1, P*). This also included 8 groups of strict biotin auxotrophs
  A&S/A groups; microorganisms not capable of biotin production 45 and with (A&S groups)
  or without (A groups) genes involved in biotin transport) with different levels
  of incompletion in the 4 core biotin biosynthesis genes (harboring from 1 to 3 biosynthetic
  genes at most), and 4 groups of biotin producers that also harbors genes coding
  for biotin transport (P&S groups). ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate
  aminotransferase; BMI, body mass index; CXCL5, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 5; GGT,
  Î³-glutamyltransferase; HDL, high-density lipoprotein. LDL, low-density lipoprotein.
