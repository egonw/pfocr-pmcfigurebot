caption: 'ACT prevents DSS-induced inflammatory response and oxidative stress through
  high mobility group box 1 protein inhibition via a heme oxygenase-1-dependent manner
  in Caco-2 cells. (A) ACT demonstrated no significant effect on cell viability in
  the MTT assay. (B) ACT had a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the DSS-induced
  reduction of cell viability. (C) SnPP partially reversed the inhibitory effect of
  ACT on the DSS-induced production of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β
  and IL-6, in Caco-2 cells. (D) SnPP partially reversed the inhibitory effect of
  ACT on DSS-induced oxidative stress. n=3. **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs. control; #P<0.05,
  ##P<0.01 and ##P<0.001 vs. DSS; @P<0.05 vs. DSS + ACT. ACT, acteoside; DSS, dextran
  sulphate sodium; MDA, malondialdehyde; CAT, catalase; GSH, glutathione; SOD, superoxide
  dismutase; SnPP, tin protoporphyrin.'
