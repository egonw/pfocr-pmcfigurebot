caption: 'Effect of anlotinib combined with 5-FU in SCLC cell lines. The H446, H1688,
  and H187 cells were treated with anlotinib, 5-FU, or combination of both for 72 h,
  and cell growth was detected using CCK8 kit. The inhibition rates in the (a) H446
  cells, (b) H1688 cells, and (c) H187 cells following treatment with anlotinib and
  5-FU in different drug concentrations (0 μM, 0.01 μM, 0.1 μM, 1 μM, 10 μM, and 20 μM)
  while 5-FU remained a fixed concentration in the mixture. The bars represent mean
  ± SEM of the three independent experiments. ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 compared with
  anlotinib. SCLC: small-cell-lung cancer.'
