  Heatmap representing MetaCyc Pathways predicted by PICRUST2.0 from zOTUs losing
  rhythmicity in Bmal1SCNfl/- mice. Pathways are ordered by the phase of the control
  and normalized to the peak abundance of each pathway. We color-coded the pathways
  according to their sub-classes. (B) Fecal SCFA concentrations in both genotype.
  (C) Circadian profiles of fecal SCFA. (D) Fecal bile acid concentrations in both
  genotype. (E–F) Circadian profiles of fecal bile acids. Significant rhythms according
  to cosine-wave regression analysis (p-value ≤ 0.05) are visualized with a solid
  line, while data connected by dashed line indicate arrhythmicity. Mann Whitney U
  test was used to assess concentration difference. n = 6 mice/time point/genotype.
  Data are represented as mean ± SEM. Significance ∗ p ≤ 0.05, ∗∗p ≤ 0.01, ∗∗∗p ≤ 0.001,
  ∗∗∗∗p ≤ 0.0001.
