caption: 'Analysis of phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38 in HO-3867-treated
  cells. (A,B) After experimental concentration range of HO-3867 treatment for 24
  h, Western blot analysis was performed to measure expressions of MAPKs, as well
  as their phosphorylation in (A) U2OS and (B) HOS cells. (C,D) Next, quantitative
  analysis was assessed. n = 3. p-ERK: U2OS: F = 661.501, p < 0.001; HOS: F = 4585.730,
  p < 0.001; p-JNK: U2OS: F = 494.446, p < 0.001; HOS: F = 855.033, p < 0.001; p-p38:
  U2OS: F = 33.591, p < 0.001; HOS: F = 23.845, p < 0.001. a Significantly different,
  p < 0.05, when compared to control. b Significantly different, p < 0.05, when compared
  to 2 μM. c Significantly different, p < 0.05, when compared to 4 μM. d Significantly
  different, p < 0.05, when compared to 8 μM.'
