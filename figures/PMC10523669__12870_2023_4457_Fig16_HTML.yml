caption: 'Expression profiles of the DEGs and accumulation of the DAMs involved in
  carotenoid metabolic pathway in leaves of ‘Ziyan Gongzhu’ at the four developmental
  stages. The scale bar represents the changes of gene expression pattern/metabolite
  accumulation: red/yellow rectangle indicates upregulated expression pattern, blue
  rectangle indicates downregulated expression pattern, and the white rectangle indicates
  gene or metabolite whose expression and accumulation did not change. The normalized
  signal intensity ranged from -1.0 to 1.0, which was consistent with color changes
  from blue to red/yellow. (T1: purple red leaf (RHS 67A), T2: light purple leaf (RHS
  65A), T3: yellow green leaf (RHS 1C), T4: dark green leaf (RHS N137A)'
