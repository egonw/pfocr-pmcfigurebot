caption: Plasma miR-637 is a useful biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of ESCC
  patients. A, B The expression levels of miR-637 and IL-8 in the plasma of healthy
  donors (HD) and ESCC patients were examined by qRT-PCR (A) and ELISA (B), respectively.
  C The relationship between miR-637 and IL-8 expression in the plasma of ESCC patients
  was evaluated via Pearson correlation analysis. D, E Low expression levels of plasma
  miR-637 correlate with advanced TNM stage (D) and lymph node metastasis (E). F,
  G The prediction performance of plasma miR-637 (F) or plasma IL-8 (G) in a cohort
  of ESCC patients were determined by ROC analysis. Data are presented as mean ± standard
  deviation. ns, not significant; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001

  and serves as a novel prognostic marker in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
