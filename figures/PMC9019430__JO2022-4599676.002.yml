caption: HAND1 is identified as the targeting mRNA of miR-196-5p. (a) Venn diagram
  depicting the intersection between the miR-196-5p and predictor targeting mRNA.
  (b) HeLa cells were co-transfected with wild-type plasmid (WT-HAND1) with miR-196-5p
  or NC and treated mutant plasmid (Mut-HAND1) with miR-196-5p or NC. Luciferase activity
  was measured 48 hours after transfection. ∗∗∗p < 0.001. (c) After treatment with
  miR-196-5p and NC for 48 hours, the relative expression level of HAND1 was detected
  by RT-qPCR. ∗∗∗ There is a statistical significance between the expression level
  of miR-196-5p in the control group compared to mimic-miR-196-5p treated group (p
  < 0.001).
