caption: Summary of the different inhibitory effects of Apl-1 in the endothelial response
  to TNF-α revealed in the present study. Red blades represent steps targeted by Apl-1.
  The canonical NF-κB pathway is simplified in the scheme. (A) Pro-inflammatory signal
  (TNF-α) activates its receptor in EC; (B) IKK complex is activated downstream TNFR;
  (C) Phosphorylated IKK promotes degradation of IκBα, releasing the NF-κB dimer RelA/p65-p50,
  and allowing its nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity (D); (E) Adhesion
  molecules are exposed in the surface of EC, and cytokines and chemokines are released,
  promoting the inflammatory response in the cell; (F) PI3K/Akt pathway is activated
  in response to TNF-α, promoting the phosphorylation of IKK complex. APs, adaptor
  proteins; Ub, ubiquitin residue; P, phosphorylated residue; TNF-α, tumor necrosis
  factor-alpha; TNFR, TNF-α receptor; NEMO, NF-κB essential modulator; IKK, I kappa
  B kinase; IκBα, NF-κB inhibitor alpha; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; VCAM-1,
  vascular adhesion molecule-1; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1; IL, interleukin.
