caption: GO, KEGG pathway, and PPI analysis results of differentially expressed N-glycoproteins
  in OA vs. N. (A) GO analysis results of the differentially expressed N-glycoproteins
  of cartilage in OA vs. N. (B) Bubble diagram of KEGG pathways in OA vs. N. The blue
  to red gradient of bubbles of KEGG pathways represent the significance from low
  to high, respectively. Bubble size represents the number of differentially expressed
  N-glycoproteins in the KEGG pathway. (C) PPI network of the significantly differential
  N-glycoproteins and pathways in OA vs. N. Rectangles represent KEGG pathways, and
  circles represent N-glycoproteins. Solid lines mean the relationship has been verified
  by research, dashed lines mean the relationship have not been verified. The yellow
  and blue colors of the N-glycoproteins represent up-regulated and down-regulated,
  respectively.
