caption: Cellular processes identified by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the
  three β-cell sub-clusters β1, β2, and β3 in the scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq integration
  dataset. A Dotplot depicting the expression levels and percentage of cells expressing
  four representative extracellular matrix (ECM)-related C2 pathway genes (interaction,
  response, organization, and integrins) and the corresponding enrichment plots below.
  B Dotplot depicting the expression levels and percentage of cells expressing four
  representative vesicle-related C2 pathway genes (biogenesis, budding, transport,
  lysosome) and the corresponding enrichment plots below. C Dotplot depicting the
  expression levels and percentage of cells expressing four representative insulin-related
  C2 pathway genes (processing, secretion, and glucose metabolism) and the corresponding
  enrichment plots below. D Dotplot depicting the expression levels and percentage
  of cells expressing four representative proliferation/differentiation related C2
  pathway genes (proliferation, development, differentiation, regulation of gene expression)
  and the corresponding enrichment plots below
