caption: 'Pathways of FARs involved in lipid metabolism in the plant kingdom. (A)
  ER-Localized FARs are involved in the accumulation of cuticular waxes. The biosynthesis
  of waxes begins with C16 or C18 de novo fatty acid synthesis in the plastid. Then,
  utilizing C16 and C18 acyl-CoAs as substrates, the fatty acid elongase (FAE) complex
  performs a reiterative cycle to synthesize saturated VLCFAs. These VLCFAs are further
  modified into primary alcohols and wax esters. (B) Plasmid-Localized FARs are involved
  in sporopollenin biosynthesis. Acyl-ACPs synthesized de novo in the plastid are
  reduced by FAR to produce fatty alcohols. This product could then be exported to
  the anther locule by an unknown mechanism where it polymerizes at the surface of
  the microspore. (C) ER-Localized FARs are involved in the suberin and suberin-associated
  wax production. De novo fatty acid synthesis occurs in the plastid. Fatty acyl elongation
  occurs via the FAE complex producing VLCFAs. FARs catalyze acyl reduction to produce
  suberin monomer primary alcohols and α, ω-diols. Coumaric, caffeic, and ferulic
  acids produced by the phenylpropanoid pathway are linked to fatty alcohols by BAHD-type
  acyltransferases to produce alkyl hydroxycinnamates (AHCs). Abbreviations: PM, plasma
  membrane; CW, cell wall.'
