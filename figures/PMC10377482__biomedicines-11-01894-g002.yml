caption: (A) Cell death flow cytometry analysis on NT2D1 cells. Graphical representation
  of the percentage of live cells (fold change) obtained by culturing NT2D1 cell in
  control conditions and U0126 doses (2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 20 µM) (Mean ± S.E. is reported)
  (* p ≤ 0.05; ** p ≤ 0.01). (B) Western Blot analyses of phospho- and total ERK1/2
  performed on cells cultured in basal condition and 5, 15, 30, 60 min after U0126
  administration. (C) Graphical representation of densitometric analyses of the bands
  (5 µM) *** vs. CTRL p ≤ 0.001. Results are expressed in fold change, with the control
  considered as 1 (± S.E.M.)). Four independent experiments were performed.
