caption: Plasma inhibited MM cell colony formation in vitro and engraftment in vivo.
  (A) Cell viability at 24 h and 48 h after pure He, He + O2 (0.5%), He + N2 (0.5%),
  He + O2 (0.5%) + N2 (0.5%), He + H2O (1%), and pure Ar plasma treatment. (B) CFC
  assays were performed after various plasma treatments. Cells were plated at a concentration
  of 10,000 per mL (LP-1). The number of colonies was counted and presented as the
  mean ± SD (n = 3). (C) Construction of the MM mouse xenograft model, and images
  of the spleens and livers of control mice and LP-1 mice. (D) Giemsa Staining with
  LP-1 cells and the bone marrow of the LP-1 mice, arrows represent LP-1 cells in
  mice bone marrow. (E) Kaplan–Meier survival analysis (n = 7). The x-axis represents
  the number of survival days from injection to the development of hind leg paralysis,
  and the y-axis represents the survival percentage. Then, (F) spleens and (G) livers
  were collected and weighed. Data represent the mean ± SD; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01
  (Student’s t test).
