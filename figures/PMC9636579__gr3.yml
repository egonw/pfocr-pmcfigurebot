caption: Global phosphoproteomics analysis of network-wide signaling effects of rucaparib
  in BRCA1-isogenic OC cells.A, schematic of quantitative global phosphoproteomics
  using TMT 6-plex technology. B, volcano plots indicating differential protein phosphorylation
  in UWB (left) and UWB+B cells (right) upon treatment with rucaparib (1 μM) for 24 h
  compared with DMSO. Log2 fold change relative to vehicle control and –log10 p values
  were plotted. Differentially modulated phosphorylation sites that pass the criteria
  (absolute value of log2 fold change > 2 × average SD, p value < 0.05, mass error
  within ± 3 ppm) are shown in blue or red shaded areas. C, KEGG pathway analysis
  of phosphoproteomics data from rucaparib treatments for 24 h using Enrichr (p value <
  0.05). D, chord plot of the top-2 ranked KEGG pathways of (C) and associated signaling
  changes in UWB and UWB+B cells. Individual proteins and significantly modulated
  phosphorylation sites are depicted. E, immunoblot analysis for p-DNAPK of UWB and
  UWB+B cells upon rucaparib treatment (1 μM, 24 h). Blots are representative of three
  independent experiments. DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide.
