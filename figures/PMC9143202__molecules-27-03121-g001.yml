caption: Effects of different concentrations of glucose on autophagy in MDBK cells.
  MDBK cells were treated with 5.5, 10.5, 15.5, and 25.5 mM glucose for 24 h, respectively.
  Western blot, qRT-PCR, and CCK-8 assay were used to assess protein expression, gene
  expression, and cell viability, respectively. (A) The cell viability; (B,C) The
  protein level of LC3-II/I, p62, and Beclin1; (D) The mRNA expression level of LC3B,
  p62, and Beclin1. * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 compared with control group.
