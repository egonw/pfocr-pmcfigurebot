figure_title: Regions of RB1-regulated susceptibility include highly mutated cancer
  driver genes
caption: (A) DAVID functional enrichment analysis (, ) of genes in the top and bottom
  5% UV susceptible regions (top n = 821; bottom n = 2,600) in RB1 KO cells compared
  with wild-type. Only genes with >10% overlap in top or bottom bin are included in
  analysis. Signed enrichment score (−log10P-value) is displayed for each functional
  group, with the significance cutoff line (P = 0.05) in black. GO, gene ontology;
  KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; GAD, Genetic Association Database;
  KW, Keyword. (B) Box plots of melanoma mutation frequency () of genes in the top
  and bottom 10% and 5% susceptible regions compared with the whole genome. Only C>T
  and G>A mutation were counted. Mutation rates were normalized by cytosine and guanine
  content of the gene. Additional details provided in the Materials and Methods section.
  Mann–Whitney U test indicates significant melanoma mutation frequency difference
  between groups (ns, not significant, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001). (C) Distance
  of cancer driver genes to the closest centromere or telomere in base pairs. Genome
  median is shown as blue dotted line in graph. Genes with oncogenic function are
  shown in green and genes with tumor suppressor function are shown in pink. (D) Mutational
  co-occurrence (in red) and mutual exclusivity (in blue) of genes in RB1 pathway,
  TERT and TPTE. Log2 odds ratio analysis was performed as described in the Materials
  and Methods section (*q < 0.05, **q < 0.01, ***q < 0.001). (D, E) Percentage of
  melanoma patients with TERT and TPTE mutations within different genic features from
  patients with (mutated) and without (not mutated) RB1 pathway mutations for genes
  shown in (D). Only C>T and G>A mutation were counted. Mutation rates were normalized
  by cytosine and guanine content of the gene. Additional details provided in the
  Materials and Methods section (ns, not significant, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P
  < 0.001). (D, F) Proportion of TERT promoter mutations at different ETS sites from
  patients with (mutated) and without (not mutated) RB1 pathway mutations for genes
  shown in (D).Source data are available online for this figure.
