caption: XBP1 deficiency promotes mitophagy activation in macrophages.(A) KEGG pathway
  enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed pathways in LPS-stimulated Xbp1FL/FL
  and Xbp1M-KO BMDMs. (B) Heat map showing the clustering of 25 upregulated genes
  that affect mitophagy in response to LPS according to genotype. (C) Relative Bnip3
  mRNA expression in LPS-stimulated Xbp1FL/FL and Xbp1M-KO BMDMs were determined using
  qPCR; n = 3 biological replicates/group; Student t test. (D) Autophagic microstructures
  in BMDM mitochondria were examined by transmission electron microscopy, 5,000 × magnification;
  scale bars, 2 μm. Arrowheads, mitophagy. Representative of 3 experiments. (E) Western
  blot was performed to determine intracellular LC3B, p62, PINK1, Parkin, and BNIP3
  protein levels in LPS-stimulated Xbp1FL/FL and Xbp1M-KO BMDMs. Statistical analysis
  was carried out using 1-way ANOVA. (F) Relative Bnip3 mRNA expression in LPS-stimulated
  Xbp1FL/FL BMDMs treated with or without toyocamycin or tunicamycin were determined
  using qPCR; n = 3 biological replicates/group. Statistical analysis was carried
  out using 1-way ANOVA. (G) Schematic diagram of the putative XBP1 binding site within
  the Bnip3 promoter. The BMDMs were subjected to ChIP assay with anti-XBP1 or IgG
  antibody. Representative results from 3 independent experiments are shown. (H) Luciferase
  activity in BMDMs co-transfected with Bnip3-promoter luciferase reporter plasmid
  and with the increasing multiplicity of infection of Ad-sXbp1 or Ad-CON. n = 3/group.
  Statistical analysis was carried out using 1-way ANOVA. (I) The expression levels
  of Bnip3 in liver tissue from mice with CCl4-, BDL-, and MCD-induced liver fibrosis
  were examined using quantitative real-time PCR; n = 6 mice/group; 1-way ANOVA. (J)
  The correlation between XBP1 levels and BNIP3 expression in human fibrotic liver
  tissue was assessed using Pearson’s correlation analysis; n = 54. The values are
  shown as the mean ± SD. Statistical significance was assessed by the Student t test
  or ANOVA. ∗∗p <0.01; ∗p <0.05. BDL, bile duct ligation; BMDMs, bone marrow-derived
  macrophages; BNIP3, BCL2/adenovirus E1B interacting protein 3; CCl4, carbon tetrachloride;
  ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes;
  LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MCD, methionine/choline-deficient diet; XBP1, X-box binding
  protein 1.
