caption: Effect of arbutin on heat stress-induced apoptosis of HaCAT and DFL cells.
  (a) Representative scatter plots of apoptosis in HaCAT and DFL cells detected by
  flow cytometry with solvent and different concentrations of arbutin (10, 50, and
  100 μmol/L) after 43°C-50 minutes heat stress. (b) Statistically compared proportion
  of apoptotic cells in (a) (n = 3). (c) Bax and Bcl2 protein expression in HaCAT
  and DFL cells of different groups detected by Western blotting. (d) Statistically
  compared expression of Bax and Bcl2 protein in (n = 3). P value was calculated by
  one-way ANOVA. ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. the control group; P < 0.001 vs. the solvent group.
