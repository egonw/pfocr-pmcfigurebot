caption: Significant signaling-metabolic pathway interconnecting paths/network in
  cervical cancer. (A) represents a significant signaling metabolic interaction network,
  (B) shows the signaling metabolic pathways interconnectivity, and (C) shows the
  significant signaling to metabolic paths regulating metabolites in cervical cancer.
  Terminal signaling pathway proteins and metabolic enzymes are colored in purple
  and blue. Protein-protein interactors are colored in orange. Protein-protein interactions
  are represented by orange edges. Nodes with an asterisk (*) are key or effector
  nodes in the significant paths/network.
