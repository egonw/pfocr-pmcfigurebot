caption: GNG5 promoted BC cell malignant behaviors through modulating Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway. (a) cyclinD1, c-myC and active-β-catenin levels within BT549 and MDA-MB-231
  cells from diverse groups were measured through WB assay. (b) Absorbance of BT549
  and mda-mb-231 cells was identified at 450 nm by CKK-8 assay at 0, 24, 48 and 72
  h in different groups. (c) The Colonies in MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells were determined
  through Colony Formation. (d and e) Transwell detects the ability of different groups
  of cells to migrate and invade. (f) WB assay was conducted to detect EMT within
  BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells from diverse groups. (g) c-myC, cyclinD1 and active-β-catenin
  levels within BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells from diverse groups were measured through
  WB assay. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. BC, breast cancer; CKK-8, Cell Counting
  Kit-8; GNG5, G protein subunit gamma 5; WB, Western blot.

  glycolysis of breast cancer cells through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
