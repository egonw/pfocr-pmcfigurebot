caption: 'Effects of COG1410 on microglial polarization and proinflammatory factors
  at 72 h after cerebral I/R. (A) Representative images of Iba-1 immunofluorescence
  staining in hippocampal CA1 area (×200); nuclei were labeled with blue fluorescence
  (DAPI), and Iba-1 was labeled with green fluorescence, scale bars = 20 μm. (b) Representative
  bands of Western blot data. (c–e) Quantitative analysis of the Western blot bands.
  (f–i) Quantitative analysis of the inflammatory factors including IL-1β, IL-18,
  TNF-α, and IL-6. Data were represented as mean ± SEM. Western blot and ELISA, n
  = 6 per group; immunofluorescence staining, n = 3 per group. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01
  vs. sham group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 vs. I/R + Vehicle group.'
