figure_title: Rb concentration dynamics regulate cell cycle progression in Cdk-low
  cells
caption: A. Schematic illustration of two parallel pathway acting through Rb concentration
  and Rb phosphorylation to promote the G1/S transition. B. Schematic illustration
  of the Cdk activities in Cdk-low and Cdk-high categories of cells. Cdk activity
  is measured using the HDHB sensor whose translocation to the cytoplasm from the
  nucleus is driven by Cdk activity. Cdk activation is defined using the inflection
  point in the cytoplasm-to-nuclear ratio. C. Fluorescent traces showing the HDHB
  cytoplasm-to-nucleus intensity ratio from HMEC-hTERT1 cells expressing endogenously
  tagged RB1–3xFLAG-Clover-sfGFP and the HDHB Cdk sensor . Cdk-high cells are defined
  as those activating Cdk within 5 hours of their birth, while Cdk-low cells activate
  Cdk later. D. Individual fluorescent traces from the cells in (C). Upper panel shows
  Cdk-low cells, and the lower panel shows Cdk-high cells. Traces are aligned by the
  initial translocation of the HDHB Cdk sensor. The trace color represents the normalized
  Rb protein concentration (normalized to the mean Rb concentration of the cells in
  the same group). E. The correlations between Rb concentration at birth and G1 length
  in Cdk-low and Cdk-high cells. F. The correlations between Rb concentration and
  G1/S transition rate in Cdk-low and Cdk-high cells. G. Cell number of HMEC cells
  treated with 0.25 µM Palbociclib for 72 hours. Cells were plated in different doses
  of doxycycline to induce exogenous Clover-3xFlag-Rb. Drug treatment started the
  next day and lasted for 72 hours. Then, cells were fixed and the cell number in
  each well was measured. H. Normalized cell number of the cells treated as described
  in panel (G). Normalized cell number is the cell number following Palbociclib treatment
  divided by the cell number under DMSO control treatment. n = 3 biological replicates,
  the error bars indicate standard deviation.
