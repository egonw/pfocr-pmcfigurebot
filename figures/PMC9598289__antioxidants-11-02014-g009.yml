caption: 9r activated the IL-6/Src/Stat3 signaling pathway. (A–D) Western blot studies
  of the levels of key proteins in the IL-6/STAT3 pathway, including IL-6, p-STAT3
  and p-Src. The Image Lab application calculated the relative intensity analysis
  of IL-6, p-STAT3 and p-Src. Data are expressed as the mean standard deviation of
  three independent experiments. Compared to the corresponding control group, * p
  < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001. Compared to the H2O2−treated group, &p <
  0.05 and &&p < 0.01.
article_title: Design, Synthesis and Evaluation of Novel 1,4-Disubstituted Piperazine-2,5-dione
  Derivatives as Antioxidants against H2O2-Induced Oxidative Injury via the IL-6/Nrf2
  Loop Pathway.
