caption: 'The improvement effect of LGU on OGD-induced mitochondrial damage in rat
  primary cortical neurons. (A) Representative image of the MMP in cerebral cortical
  neurons detected by using a JC-1 probe and CLSM (400×). (B) Quantitative analysis
  of the effect of LGU on mitochondrial damage at 90 min after OGD exposure. The change
  in the MMP was characterized by the change in the mean green/red fluorescence intensity
  ratio. Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM, n = 3. ###: p < 0.001 vs. ctrl group
  and ***: p < 0.001 vs. OGD group.'
