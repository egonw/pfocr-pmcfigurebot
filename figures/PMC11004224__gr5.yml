caption: 'KEGG network diagram of the PPAR signaling pathwayWhite boxes: biological
  pathway maps. Green boxes: genes or genetic products. Circles: molecules. Solid
  line arrows: direct relationship or molecular interaction. Dashed line arrows: indirect
  relationship or unknown reaction. Green boxes + arrows + circles + arrows = gene
  expression relationship. In red are the genes participating in the FAT-PM2.5-CEJUS
  signature in this pathway. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this
  figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)'
