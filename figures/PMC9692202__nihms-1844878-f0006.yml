caption: Mitochondria synthesize and release signals evolved to influence cellular
  and organismal functions. Mitochondrial signals arise from various mitochondrial
  compartments and reach the cytoplasm, nucleus, and other organelles, where they
  induce cell-autonomous responses. These responses are transmitted to the systemic
  circulation either directly as mitochondria-derived metabolites and mitokines, or
  indirectly through transcriptional regulation of nuclear genes encoding metabokines
  or other hormone-like mediators. Mito-nuclear signaling is a form of signal amplification
  and integration. The MIPS converts metabolic signals into extracellular proteinaceous,
  secreted factors, allowing mitochondria to signal their state well beyond the confine
  of the cell in which they reside. AcCoA, acetyl coenzyme A; AIF, apoptosis inducible
  factor; ATFS1, activating transcription factor associated with stress-1; cf-mtDNA,
  cell-free mitochondrial DNA; Cholest, cholesterol; Cyt c, cytochrome c; DELE1, DAP3-binding
  cell death enhancer 1; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FGF21, fibroblast growth factor
  21; GDF15, growth differentiation factor 15; GPS2, G-protein pathway suppressor
  2; HSP60, heat shock protein 60; ISRmt, integrated stress response; MAVS, mitochondrial
  antiviral signaling; MDVs, mitochondria-derived vesicles; MPDs, mitochondria-derived
  peptides; NLRP3, NLR family pyrin domain containing 3; Numts, nuclear mitochondrial
  DNA segments; Preg, pregnenolone; P450ssc, side chain cleavage enzyme cytochrome
  P450; RLRs, RIG-I-like receptors; StAR, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein;
  UPRmito, mitochondrial unfolded protein response; 11βH, 11β-hydroxylase (mitochondrial
  cytochrome P450 11B1).
