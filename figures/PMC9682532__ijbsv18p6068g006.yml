caption: 'GALNT1 positively regulates Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway through O-glycosylation
  of CD44. A-C, GALNT1 modification of O-glycosylation of CD44 measured by co-immunoprecipitation
  in gastric cancer cells. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) for CD44, and
  then western blotted with biotin-conjugated VVA to distinguish Tn antigen expression.
  D-F, Lectin pull down glycoproteins using biotinylated VVA, and streptavidin agarose
  immunoblotted with anti-CD44 antibody. G, Western blot and qPCR analysis for the
  silencing efficiency of CD44 in AGS cells. H, The growth abilities of AGS cells
  after GALNT1 overexpression and CD44 knockdown were determined by colony formation
  assays. I, The migration and invasion abilities of AGS cells transfected with OE-GALNT1
  and shCD44 measured by transwell assays. Representative images of the migrated or
  invaded cells and statistical graphs are shown. J-K, Immunofluorescence assay (J),
  and western blot analysis (K) depicting the nuclear translocation of β-catenin in
  AGS cells transfected with OE-GALNT1 and shCD44. Scale bar: 50 µm. Data are shown
  as means ± S.D. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.'
