caption: Schematic overview of the late-acting, cytosolic iron-sulfur assembly machinery
  (CIA complex). This schematic represents the general, proposed mechanism of [4Fe-4S]2+
  cluster trafficking through the CIA complex for insertion into cytosolic and nuclear
  [4Fe-4S]2+ enzymes; however, not all factors are required definitively, and the
  utilization of this pathway can be highly context-dependent. For example, ribonucleotide
  reductase, critical for S-phase cell cycle entry to begin DNA replication, contains
  a di-ferric center whose formation is mediated by GLRX3 ().
