caption: Overexpression of DR5 induces the sensitization of HT29 cells to NSC49L and
  TRAILOne set of the HT29-tet-DR5 cells was treated with DOX (1 μg/mL) to induce
  the expression of DR5. Then, control and DR5-induced cells were treated with different
  concentrations of NSC49L and TRAIL either alone or in combination for 72 h. The
  cell survival was determined by the MTT-assay.(A) Doxycycline-induced DR5 expression
  was verified by immunoblot.(B) IC50 of TRAIL.(C) IC50 of NSC49L in the presence
  of 0, 0.5, and 1 nM of TRAIL, respectively. Data are the mean ± SE of four different
  estimations. The p-value is shown on the top of each graph.
