caption: (A,C,E) Western Blot analyses of phospho- and total ERK1/2 performed on cells
  cultured in basal condition and with HGF, U0126, U0126 + HGF for 5 min, 24 and 48
  h. (B,D,F) Densitometric analyses of the bands are reported on the right (§§ vs.
  ** vs. Ctrl p < 0.01; § vs. * vs. Ctrl p < 0.05). Results are expressed in fold
  change, with the control considered as 1 (± standard error of the mean (S.E.M.)).
  Three independent experiments were performed.
