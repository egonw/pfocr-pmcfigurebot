figure_title: RNA sequencing performed on TAMs and CAFs demonstrate distinct inflammatory
  phenotypes in responding tumors
caption: A PCA plot of bulk RNA sequencing from TAMs isolated from d14 untreated or
  irradiated (SCRT; d9-13) tumors. Red circle = untreated; UT. Purple circles = irradiated.
  B The Euclidian distance between the untreated average and each irradiated sample
  plotted against tumor size. Red = untreated, blue = responders, green = nonresponders
  and quantified in (C). D DAMP/PAMP pathway analysis of differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs) from responder or nonresponder TAMs compared to TAMs from untreated
  tumors. E DEGs from responding sorted TAMs compared to nonresponding TAMs analyzed
  by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). F DEGs between responding and nonresponding
  cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) plotted on a hierarchical clustering heatmap.
  Teal box = nonresponders and untreated and pink box = responders. G GSEA analysis
  identified differences in predominately immune related signatures in CAFs from responder
  tumors. N = 5 untreated, 10 irradiated (6 responder, 4 nonresponders for TAMs; 4
  responders, 6 nonresponders for CAFs).
