caption: The mechanism of induction of lysosome-induced immunogenic cell death is
  shown including reactive oxygen (ROS)-induced leakage of lysosomal membranes and
  mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). These are followed by an increase
  in intracellular levels of degradative enzymes and the translocation of calreticulin
  (an “eat me signal”) to the cell surface.
