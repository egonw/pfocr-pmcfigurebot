caption: miR-146b suppresses inflammation and M1 polarization via inhibiting FGL2
  in macrophages. miR-146b mimics and FGL2 overexpression plasmids were co-transfected
  into LPS-induced macrophages, and the transfection efficacy of FGL2 overexpression
  was examined by Western blotting (A). The levels of inflammation-related factors
  were determined by ELISA assay (B), and M1 macrophage polarization-related indicators
  (C) and the NF-κB and MAPK pathways (D) were determined by Western blotting.
