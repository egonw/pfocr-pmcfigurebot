figure_title: Oxidative phosphorylation is upregulated in FBXW7−/− cells
caption: a Analysis of Hallmark pathways using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
  demonstrates that the oxidative phosphorylation pathway was the most upregulated
  gene set in FBXW7−/− cells. This graph shows the top ten differentially expressed
  gene sets by normalised enrichment scores. b 86 genes within the oxidative phosphorylation
  gene set were differentially expressed. Among these 86, the 14 which showed log2FC > 0.7
  or <0.7 have been represented in this heatmap. c Metabolic analysis of oxygen consumption
  rate was increased in FBXW7−/− cells relative to wildtype cells (p = 0.0015). There
  was no significant difference in the extracellular acid production rate. d Immunofluorescence
  of wildtype and FBXW7−/− cells with Hoechst 33342 nuclear stain (blue), phalloidin
  cytoskeleton stain (red) and HSP60 (green). Scale bar represents 50 µm. e Immunofluorescence
  of HSP60 was normalised against Hoechst and was increased in FBXW7−/− cells (p = 0.0086).
  f Immunofluorescence of wildtype and FBXW7−/− cells with Hoechst 33342 nuclear stain
  (blue), phalloidin cytoskeleton stain (red) and ATP5A1 (green). Scale bar represents
  50 µm. g Immunofluorescence of ATP5A1 was normalised against Hoechst and was increased
  in FBXW7−/− cells (p = 0.0085). h Western blot showing upregulation of HSP60 and
  ATP5A1 in FBXW7−/− cells compared to wildtype cells. The values in this figure are
  mean ± sd, and statistical significance was measured by unpaired t-test. All experiments
  were performed with N = 3 biological replicates.
