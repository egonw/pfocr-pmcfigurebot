caption: Representative LC–MS/MS extracted ion chromatogram of EGCG-sulfates generated
  by human cytosol or standards. EGCG was incubated with HLC, small intestinal cytosol
  (HIC), and 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS). The supernatants and authentic
  standards were analyzed by LC–MS/MS operated in full-scan mode. Analyses were carried
  out using the extracted ion chromatogram (XIC) of the m/z 537.03445 ion with a 0.002
  Da window. RT means retention time.
