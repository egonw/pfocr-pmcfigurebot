caption: 'Effects of ATL-III on protein and mRNA expression levels of GRP78, CHOP,
  and PERK after using ERS inhibitor 4-PBA. a-d: effects of ATL-III on protein expression
  levels of GRP78 (a, b), CHOP (a, c), and PERK (a, d) after using ERS inhibitor 4-PBA.
  e-g: effects of ATL-III on mRNA levels of GRP78 (e), CHOP (f), and PERK (g) after
  using ERS inhibitor 4-PBA. Data were mean ± SD; ∗∗P < 0.01 versus control group;
  #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 versus model group.'
