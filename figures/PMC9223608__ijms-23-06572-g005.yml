caption: Correlation of pathway enrichment in the parental tumor and drug response
  of corresponding PD-GBOs. (a) Heatmap illustrating inter-sample z-score of 193 KEGG
  pathways enrichment levels from four high-grade glioma tissues. KEGG pathway super
  series groups are color-coded. Raw values are provided in . (b) Pearson correlation
  coefficient of drug response score and specific interindividual KEGG pathway enrichment
  levels visualized as a heatmap. On the basis of the correlation coefficient with
  drug response, pathways are divided into three clusters (C1, C2, and C3). For individual
  pathways within clusters, see . (c) Linear regression of PD-GBO drug response score
  and enrichment of annotated biologically related pathways (KEGG drug database).
