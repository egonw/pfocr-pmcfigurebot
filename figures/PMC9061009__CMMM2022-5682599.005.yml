caption: Expression of neuropeptides in the ceRNA network and their ability to classify
  BPD. (a) Sankey diagram demonstrating three miRNA-NP mRNA regulatory pairs in the
  ceRNA network; (b) differential expression of the neuropeptide-related genes OPRL1
  and NPPA between samples from the BPD and control groups; (c) the AUC values of
  the diagnostic classification ability of OPRL1 and NPPA for BPD were shown; (d)
  gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of OPRL1 indicates the KEGG CYTOKINE CYTOKINE
  RECEPTOR INTERACTION pathway and NABA ECM REGULATORS pathway are elevated. (e) GSEA
  of NPPA indicated the KEGG NEUROACTIVE LIGAND RECEPTOR INTERACTION pathway and the
  REACTOME ADORA2B MEDIATED ANTI INFLAMMATORY pathway.
