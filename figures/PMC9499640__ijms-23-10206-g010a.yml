caption: Signal interactions and pathway enrichment analysis. (a) DEGs of Tg versus
  WT were analyzed to identify the Reactome and KEGG pathways in which they involved
  by using Cytoscape with ClueGo. A total of seven significant identified pathway
  clusters were labelled in colored letters. A representative pathway for each cluster
  was selected by the percentage of genes involved per term as well as the number
  of genes matched in the term. (b) Pie chart of identified pathways based on Reactome
  and KEGG pathways. Seven significant pathways (group p value corrected with Bonferroni
  step down) were marked with asterisk (** for p < 0.01 and * for p < 0.05) among
  eight total pathways.
