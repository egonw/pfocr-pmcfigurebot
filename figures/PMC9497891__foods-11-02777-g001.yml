caption: Change in the expression of the volatile-relative genes of Merlot and Marselan.
  (A) VvDXS1, VvDXS3, VvDXR, VvHDR from the MEP pathway. (B) VvLoXA, VvADH1, VvADH2,
  VvADH3 from the LOX pathway. (C) VvGPPS, VvFPPS, VvLinNer1, VvLinNer2 from the MEP
  pathway. (D) VvCCD1, VvCCD4a, VvCCD4b from the C13-compound synthesis pathway. (E)
  VvGT5, VvGT6, VvGT7, VvGT9, VvGT14 for the synthesis of glycosylated volatile compounds.
  Data are the mean concentration (n = 3). Different letters show significant differences
  between treatments by Duncan’s multiple range test (p ≤ 0.05).
