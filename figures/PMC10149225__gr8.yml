caption: Periostin alleviates ALD by activating autophagy and inhibiting the mTORC1
  pathway in WT mice. (A) Schematic images of WT mice administrated with rapamycin
  and MHY1485. (B–C) Western blot analysis of the mTORC1 and autophagy-related proteins
  in WT mouse livers treated with rapamycin and MHY1485. (D–E) Body weight changes
  and food intake in WT mice with rapamycin and MHY1485 administration (n = 10 mice
  per group). (F) The ratios of liver-to-body weight in the livers of WT mice treated
  with MHY1485. G, H&E, Oil red, Sirius red, and Masson staining of the livers from
  WT mice injected with rapamycin and MHY1485. (H–I) The relative mRNA levels of inflammation
  (H) and fibrosis-related genes (I) in the livers of WT mice treated with rapamycin
  and MHY1485. (n = 10 mice per group). (J–Q) Serum (J-M) and hepatic (N-Q) levels
  of TG, T-CHO, AST, and ALT in WT mice administrated with rapamycin and MHY1485.
  Data represent the mean ± standard deviation (3 independently repeated experiments);
  ∗P < .05; ∗∗P < .01; ∗∗∗P < .001; n.s., not significant (Student t test). Scale
  bars, 50 μm.
