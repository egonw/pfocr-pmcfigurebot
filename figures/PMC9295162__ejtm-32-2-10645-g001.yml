caption: ATGL pathway and mutations in NLSDM patients. (a) Triacylglycerol hydrolysis
  is composed of a series of interrelated reactions. The primary reaction is performed
  by the adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). This lipase, after activation through
  the interaction with ABHD5, promotes the release of the first free fatty acid (FFA)
  from triacylglycerol (TAG), producing diacylglycerol (DAG). In the second step the
  hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) leads to DAG conversion into monoacylglycerol (MAG).
  The lipolytic cascade culminates with the monoglyceride lipase activity (MGL), which
  induces third FFA and glycerol release. (b) Percentage of ATGL different variations
  found in NLSDM patients. Most of these mutations, such as frameshift and splice
  site mutations, and retrotransposon insertion, lead to a loss or truncated protein
  production.
