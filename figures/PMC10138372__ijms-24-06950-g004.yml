caption: Transcriptome analysis of CqTPSs and CqTPPs and related processes and metabolism
  analysis of related metabolites in quinoa leaves undergoing saline-alkali stress.
  (A,B) Transcriptome analysis of expression levels of CqTPS and CqTPP family genes
  in quinoa leaves. Two-week-old quinoa seedlings were treated with a carbonate solution
  containing 100 mM Na2CO3:NaHCO3 = 1:9 for two weeks. (C) Metabolism analysis of
  the differently accumulated metabolites (DAMs) in the starch and sucrose metabolism
  pathway. (D) Go enrichment analysis of total differently expressed genes (DEGs).
  Arrows, trehalose-related processes.
