caption: Representative images showing the effect of altered expression of OsRACK1B
  on H2O2 accumulation in rice leaves (A,C) and roots (B). (A,B) H2DCFDA staining
  (green fluorescence) alone or plus DPI of the leaf sheaths (50 µM) and roots (10
  µM) of eight-week-old wild-type and OsRACK1B-overexpressed rice plants. A fluorescence
  microscope was used for the detection of H2O2 fluorescence. LR, lateral root; SR,
  seminal root. Bars = 100 μm. (C,D) DAB staining shows DAB polymerization product
  (dark brown spots) in the fully expanded leaf of eight-week-old wild-type and OsRACK1B-overexpressed
  (OX) rice plants (C) and the relative quantity of spots developed after 72 h of
  DAB staining measured by ImageJ (imagej.nih.gov/ij, accessed on 31 October 2019).
