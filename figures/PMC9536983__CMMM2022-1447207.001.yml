caption: MSC-AS1 and miR-429 levels in NPC tumor tissues and cells. (a) MSC-AS1 expression
  was detected in tumor and adjacent normal tissues from 80 NPC patients by qRT-PCR
  analysis. The expression of MSC-AS1 was significantly higher in tumor tissues than
  in normal ones. (b) Patients were classified into high MSC-AS1 expression and low
  expression groups based on the median. The survival curve showed that high MSC-AS1
  expression was negatively correlated with survival time. (c) The expression of miR-429
  was measured in NPC tumor and adjacent normal tissues by qRT-PCR analysis. MiR-429
  expression was obviously lower in tumor tissues, compared with normal controls.
  (d) Pearson analysis was conducted to analyze the correlation between the expression
  of MSC-AS1 and miR-429. The result showed that MSC-AS1 and miR-429 expression exhibited
  a negative relationship in NPC tissues. (e) The expression level of MSC-AS1 was
  detected in NPC cell lines (C666-1, HK-1, and TW01) and normal NP-69 cells. MSC-AS1
  expression was significantly increased in NPC cell lines, compared with NP-69. ∗p
  < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001. (f) The expression of miR-429 was detected
  in NPC cell lines (C666-1, HK-1, and TW01) and normal NP-69 cells by qRT-PCR analysis.
  miR-429 expression was markedly declined in NPC cell lines. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01,
  and ∗∗∗p < 0.001.
