caption: 'Isorhamnetin-induced neuroprotection attenuated the effect of TYK2 overexpression.
  (a) Experimental design scheme. (b–g) Immunoblots revealed TYK2/STAT1, JAK2/STAT3
  signaling, and cleaved caspase 3 in HMC3-conditioned medium- or IL-6- (350 pg/mL)
  stimulated neurons treated with TYK2 overexpression and 10 μM isorhamnetin. Isorhamnetin
  abrogated the activities of apoptosis and the TYK2/STAT1 pathway. Data were analyzed
  using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni''s post hoc test (∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P
  < 0.001 (HMC3 C.M vs HMC3 C.M/ISN; HMC3 C.M vs overTYK2/HMC3 C.M; HMC3 C.M vs overTYK2/HMC3
  C.M/ISN and IL-6 vs IL-6/ISN; IL-6 vs overTYK2/IL-6; IL-6 vs overTYK2/IL-6/ISN);
  ##P < 0.01, ####P < 0.0001 (HMC3 C.M/ISN vs overTYK2/HMC3 C.M; HMC3 C.M/ISN vs overTYK2/HMC3
  C.M/ISN and IL-6/ISN vs overTYK2/IL-6; IL-6/ISN vs overTYK2/IL-6/ISN); ※P < 0.05,
  ※※P < 0.01 (overTYK2/HMC3 C.M vs overTYK2/HMC3 C.M/ISN and overTYK2/IL-6 vs overTYK2/IL-6/ISN),
  n = 3; means ± SEM). HMC3 C.M: HMC3-conditioned medium; ISN: isorhamnetin; overTYK2:
  overexpressed TYK2.'
