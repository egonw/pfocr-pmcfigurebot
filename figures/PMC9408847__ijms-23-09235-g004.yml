caption: 'Effects of intermittent hypoxia (IH) exposure to the MAPK pathway on the
  allergen-induced (Dp) mice model. (A) Western blotting for MAPK signaling key factors
  ERK, JNK, p38, and MEK and their phosphorylated forms before and after 3 days of
  IH exposure and their molecular weight (kDa). (B–E) Relative expression of phosphorylated
  and total ERK (B), JNK (C), p38 (D), and MEK (E). Data in 2 groups: control (CTL)
  and Dp groups were compared before and after 3 days of IH exposure. Data shown are
  the mean ± standard deviation (n = 5).'
