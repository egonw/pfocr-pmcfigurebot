caption: Effect of 8Q and PTX treatments on the NF-κB signaling pathway in MDA-MB-231
  cells. (A) Representative Western blots of total and phosphorylated NF-κB p65 protein
  levels upon treatment with PTX, 8Q or their combination (2 μM and 25 μM, respectively).
  The β-actin protein expression level was used as a loading control. (B) Quantification
  of band intensity in Western blots. The results are expressed as normalized protein
  levels, referred to β-actin expression, represented as mean ± SEM of three independent
  experiments. Statistic t-test analysis of 8Q and combined therapy was done in comparison
  with control non-treated cells (black asterisks, ** p < 0.01) as well as with PTX
  treatment (blue asterisks, * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01).
