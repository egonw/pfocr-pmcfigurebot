caption: PREPL modulates long-term potentiation in hippocampus. Basal synaptic transmission
  and synaptic plasticity in CA1 after PREPL ODN administration. C57BL6 mice were
  injected bilaterally in the hippocampi with scrambled ODN (Scr ODN, 5′-T*T*C*TCCGAACGTGTCAAT*C*G*T-3′)
  or PREPL ODN (5′-G*T*T*AGTCGGCCATCGGCA*T*G*C-3′), sacrificed after 5 hours, and
  hippocampal slices used for electrophysiological recordings. (A) Basal synaptic
  transmission. (B) Paired-pulse facilitation (PPR). (C) Long-term potentiation (LTP).
  LTP induced by theta-burst stimulation (four pulses at 100 Hz repeated with 10-millisecond
  interburst intervals) is significantly impaired in PREPL ODN mice (three male mice,
  five slices, t test, P < 0.001).
