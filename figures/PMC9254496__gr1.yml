caption: DMD homolog enzymes involved in the known MVA pathways. Enzyme reactions
  of a part of the eukaryotic MVA pathway, the Thermoplasma-type MVA pathway, and
  the haloarchaea-type MVA pathway, from MVA to IPP are indicated. Upstream reactions
  from acetyl-CoA to MVA and the final isomerase reaction from IPP to DMAPP are omitted
  for sake of simplicity. The reactions catalyzed by the DMD homologs are boxed. The
  archeal MVA pathway, which does not involve DMD homologs, was omitted. DMAPP, dimethylallyl
  diphosphate; DMD, diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase; IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate;
  MVA, mevalonate.
article_title: Crystal structure of mevalonate 3,5-bisphosphate decarboxylase reveals
  insight into the evolution of decarboxylases in the mevalonate metabolic pathways.
