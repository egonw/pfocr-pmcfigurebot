caption: MCDD regulates PCOS-IR estrous cycle disorder and improves ovarian pathological
  characteristics. The vaginal smear method was used to observe the estrous cycle
  stages of the rats in each group under an upright microscope after methylene blue
  staining (A) Proestrus, (B) Estrus, (C) Metestrus, (D) Diestrus. The above results,
  n=12 (scan bar:200 μm). After the rats were sacrificed, the left ovaries were collected,
  soaked in 4% paraformaldehyde, representative images of H&E-stained rat ovaries
  for the indicated groups. (E) H&E-stained rat ovaries of control group (scan bar:1000
  μm). GF (Gratian follicle), “a” means corpus luteum,”b” means Primordial follicle
  (PmF), “c” means Primary follicle (PrF). (F) H&E-stained rat ovaries of model group.
  AF (Atretic follicle). (G) H&E-stained rat ovaries of Met group. (H) H&E-stained
  rat ovaries of high dose group. (I) H&E-stained rat ovaries of medium dose group.
  “aa” means fresh corpus luteum (there is blood remaining in the corpus luteum, which
  is a relatively fresh corpus luteum after ovulation). (J) H&E-stained rat ovaries
  of low dose group. The above results, n = 3.
