caption: Antioxidant transcriptome in enhanced cardiac Nrf2 signalling. (A) GSEA plot
  of most enriched Nrf2 pathway from Wikipathways. GSEA algorithm calculates an enrichment
  score for a pathway by walking down the ranked list of genes, increasing a running-sum
  statistic when a gene is in the gene set and decreasing it when it is not. The magnitude
  of the increment depends on the correlation of the gene with the phenotype. The
  ES is the maximum deviation from zero encountered in walking the list. A positive
  ES indicates gene set enrichment at the top of the ranked list; a negative ES indicates
  gene set enrichment at the bottom of the ranked list. (B) Heatmap illustrating changes
  in 103 genes enriched in the Nrf2 pathway. (C) RT-qPCR validation of gene expression
  of Gstm1, Gsta3, Gstt2 and Gstm3, Nrf2, Txnrd1, Sod3 and Tgfbr2. All RT-qPCR gene
  expression were normalized to Gapdh. Error bars represent SEM. * p-value < 0.05,
  ** p-value < 0.01, *** p-value < 0.001, **** p-value < 0.0001.
