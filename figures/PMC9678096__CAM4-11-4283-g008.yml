caption: Capsaicin induced apoptosis in HepG2 but not in WB‐F344 cells. (A) and (B)
  Capsaicin inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 cells (A) and WB‐F344 cells (B) as
  detected with the CCK‐8 assay (n = 5). (C) and (D) The expression of apoptosis‐related
  proteins BCL2 and Caspase‐3 was detected with western blotting in HepG2 cells (C)
  and (D) WB‐F344 cells incubated with different doses of capsaicin (0, 100, 200,
  300 μmol/L) for 24 h. (E) Flow cytometric analysis validated that capsaicin induces
  human HepG2 cell apoptosis significantly but not that of rat WB‐F344 cells
