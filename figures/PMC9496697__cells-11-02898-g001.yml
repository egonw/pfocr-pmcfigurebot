caption: GSK3 regulatory function in different signaling pathways. (a) GSK3 regulates
  glucose homeostasis through the inhibition of TSC1/2 and Raptor/mTOR complex. (b)
  Nrf2 release, mediating the oxidative stress response, is inhibited by GSK3. (c)
  GSK3 regulates inflammation through the phosphorylation of NF-ÎºB and upstream effectors.
  (d) Wnt signaling pathway activation induces VEGF expression and as such positively
  regulates vascularization. (e) Release of GSK3 inhibition following Wnt and growth
  factors addition enhances regeneration through Ccnd1 induction and mTOR/CRMP2 signaling,
  respectively. Created with BioRender.com.
