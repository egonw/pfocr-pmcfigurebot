caption: Schema of the study.A, the glucagon pathway initiates when glucagon (GCG)
  binds with its cognate receptor (GCGR) and triggers the downstream pathway. This
  pathway follows two routes; in the first one, the suppressor of MEK2 (SMEK2) complex
  dephosphorylates cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) regulated transcriptional
  coactivator 2 (CRTC2) that subsequently binds with CREB and induces the transcription
  of target genes. The second route follows the guanine protein subunit α Q (GNAQ)
  and involves the Forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) signaling pathway, where protein
  arginine N-methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) methylates FOXO1, which forms a complex with
  peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-α (PGC-1α) and induces
  the gluconeogenesis-related genes. B, the workflow that was adopted to perform the
  LC-MS/MS study. CBP, CREB-binding protein; Crtc2LKO, liver-specific Crtc2 knockout;
  FASP, filter-aided sample preparation; PD, proteome discoverer; PP4C, protein phosphatase
  4 catalytic subunit; SDS, sodium dodecyl sulfate.
