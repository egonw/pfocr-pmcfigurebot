figure_title: Shared pathways and biological functions governing behavioral domains
caption: Alterations in genes associated with NDDs may have an effect on shared or
  distinct biological pathways at the cellular level. These pathways, such as for
  example protein synthesis or synaptic signaling, can converge on higher level neuronal
  networks and biological functions, such as dopamine or oxytocin signaling. Such
  higher order biological function can, in turn, converge on to specific phenotypes
  or behavioral domains. As each behavioral domain is dependent on multiple biological
  functions, there can be several neurobiological mechanisms that would cause similar
  phenotypes. Analyzing the convergence of multiple genetic mutations on a pathway
  level and assessing their impact on biological functions can help to understand
  the neurobiological underpinnings of behavioral phenotypes.
