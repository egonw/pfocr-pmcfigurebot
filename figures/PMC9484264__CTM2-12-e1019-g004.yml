caption: 'Chrysin targeting RhoA/PI3K/AKT pathway inhibits myeloid‐derived suppressor
  cells (MDSCs) and exerts anti‐tumour effect: (A) Schematics show the treatments
  of tumour‐bearing C57BL6 mice; (B) representative photographs of transplanted tumours
  at the end of the experiment; mouse body weight (C), tumour volume (D) and tumour
  weight (E) change in each group; flow cytometry analysed the effect of Chr on the
  ratio of MDSCs (left) and CD8+ T cells (right) in the marrow (F) and spleen (G).
  Chr‐L, 20 mg/kg; Chr‐H, 40 mg/kg, n = 6; (H) enrichment analysis of GO and KEGG;
  (I) protein–protein interaction (PPI) network of differential genes in MDSCs; (J)
  the effects of Chr on RhoA, Akt and p‐Akt in G‐MDSC at the protein level, as detected
  by Western blot. Data expressed as mean ± SD. ns, not significant. *p < .05, **p < .01.
