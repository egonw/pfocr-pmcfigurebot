caption: 'SEMA6D reversed the catabolism induced by FN-f. (a) The transfection effect
  of si-SEMA6D and pcDNA3.1-SEMA6D was verified by qRT-PCR. (b–c) Down-regulation
  of SEMA6D resulted in an overexpression of MMP-2 and MMP-13 both in normal chondrocytes
  and OP1-treated chondrocytes. (d) Western blotting was performed to measure the
  expression of MMP-2, MMP-13, and SEMA6D. ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗p < 0.05, and
  # indicates no significant difference compared with the control group.'
