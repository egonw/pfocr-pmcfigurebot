caption: Characterization of UGT72B23 in vivo and in vitro. (a) Activity screening
  of recombinant CSS0024764 proteins with different substrates. The activity of ECG
  was set as 100%. Values are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation of triplicate
  samples. (b) ECG glucoside identification. m/z 605 EIC of tea leaves, (c, d) Kinetic
  data of recombinant CSS0024764 for ECG and EGCG, respectively. (e) Mass spectral
  analysis of the formed product rt = 7.62 min, and ESI tandem mass product ions (m/z)
  of glycoside derivatives of epicatechin gallate following the glucose position in
  negative mode. (f) Mass spectral of UGT72B23 overexpression in tobacco. (g, i, k)
  Relative expression level of UGT72B23 in overexpressed tobacco lines, silenced in
  tea leaves by AsODN and different tissues of tea plant, respectively. (h, j, l)
  Relative concentration of ECG glucosides in overexpressed tobacco lines, silenced
  in tea leaves by AsODN and different tissues of tea plant, respectively. Duncan's
  multiple‐range test was carried out, and statistical significance was calculated
  with one‐way ANOVA using SPSS 20.0 (P < 0.05). CK, empty vector control; UGT72B23‐OE,
  overexpression of UGT72B23.
