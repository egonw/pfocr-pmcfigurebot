caption: PDIA4 was upregulated in BC and TNBC and associated with TNBC progression
  and prognosis. A PDIA4 mRNA was significantly higher in BC tissues than the adjacent
  normal tissues based on the TCGA dataset (1105 BC tissues and 113 adjacent normal
  tissues). In a subclass analysis of breast cancer, PDIA4 mRNA expression was significantly
  higher in TNBC than in luminal and Her-2 positive cancers in UALCAN database. B
  PDIA4 mRNA was significantly higher in TNBC tissues than the adjacent normal tissues
  based on the TCGA dataset (116 TNBC tissues and 113 adjacent normal tissues). Kaplan–Meier
  survival analysis showed that higher PDIA4 expression was associated with poor OS
  in TNBC patients. C The expression level of PDIA4 in TNBC and adjacent non-tumor
  tissues was analyzed by RT-PCR. D The expression levels of PDIA4 in eight pairs
  of TNBC tissues (T) and adjacent non-tumor tissues (N) were analyzed by western
  blot. E Representative results of the upregulation of PDIA4 protein in TNBC specimens
  via immunohistochemistry. F Representative results of the upregulation of PDIA4
  protein in TNBC specimens via immunofluorescence. All data are shown as the mean ± S.D.
  of at least three independent experiments. The P values were calculated using unpaired
  Student’s t test. *P < 0.05; ***P < 0.001
