figure_title: Clustering of TCGA dataset based on Angiogenesis, IL-6 and PD1 pathway
  expression
caption: A. RNAscope and IHC for IL-6 and IL-6R in HGSOC patient biopsies B. Heatmap
  illustrates GSVA enrichment scores for Lu tumor angiogenesis up, Kegg JAK-STAT signaling
  pathway and Hallmark IL6-JAK-STAT signaling from MSigDB calculated for each sample
  of the TCGA ovarian dataset (n=571). C. Boxplots illustrate GSVA scores for Lu tumor
  angiogenesis up, Kegg JAK-STAT signaling pathway and Hallmark IL6-JAK-STAT across
  clusters 6,7,8 and 9 representing four major patterns of pathwaysâ€™ expression (n=57,
  65, 38, 79 respectively). D. ConsensusTME applied on sample clusters identified
  in B. Boxplots illustrate GSVA scores for macrophages and endothelial cells across
  the four clusters of interest. E. Heatmap illustrates GSVA enrichment scores for
  Lu tumor angiogenesis up and Reactome PD1 signaling calculated for each sample of
  TCGA ovarian dataset. F. Boxplots illustrate GSVA scores for Lu tumor angiogenesis
  up and Reactome PD1 signaling across clusters 5,1,10 and 9 representing the four
  major expression patterns of these pathways (n= 46, 65, 76, 43 respectively). G.
  ConsensusTME was applied on the sample clusters identified in E. Boxplots illustrate
  GSVA scores for CD4 and CD8 T cells across four clusters of interest.
