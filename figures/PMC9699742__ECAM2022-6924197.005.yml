caption: 'GJD''s effect on the protein expression of Ras/ERK1/2 pathway of TGF-beta
  1, Ras, ERK1/2, and C-Fos in left ventricular tissue in each group. (a) Expression
  level of TGF-beta1, Ras, ERK1/2, and C-Fos, (b) expression level of TGF-beta 1,
  (c) expression level of Ras, (d) expression level of ERK1/2, and (e) expression
  level of C-Fos (n = 3). Values are means ± SD. Control: WKY (Wistar–Kyoto rats),
  model: spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), GJD-L: SHR received GJD low dose,
  GJD-M: SHR received GJD medium dose, GJD-H: SHR received GJD high dose, and CAPT:
  SHR received captopril. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. control. #P
  < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, and ###P < 0.001 vs. model.'
