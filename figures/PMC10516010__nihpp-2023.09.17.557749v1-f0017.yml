figure_title: Network plot demonstrates the effect of the cluster 2A upstream regulators
  on cell-cycle genes
caption: The network using edges estimated from the BG model are plotted. Colors indicate
  the effect size and arrows indicate the direction of effect. The genes on the left-hand
  side are among the 84 KOâ€™d genes, and the genes on the right are genes that are
  listed among the KEGG cell cycle pathway genes.
