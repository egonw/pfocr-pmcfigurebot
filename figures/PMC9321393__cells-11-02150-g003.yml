caption: GSEA analysis of RS1-KO retinas. (a,b) Enriched gene sets of RS1-KO retinas
  at P15 (a) and P56 (b) using GSEA (version_4.1.0; database_c5.go.bp.v7.4.symbols.gmt).
  Top five upregulated (red) and downregulated (blue) gene sets are shown. (c–e).
  Enrichment plot (left) and heatmap (right) of the enriched gene sets at P15, including
  the positive regulation of peptide hormone secretion (c), phototransduction (d),
  and regulation of type I interferon-mediated signaling pathway (e). (f–h) Enrichment
  plot (left) and heatmap (right) of the enriched gene sets at P56, including the
  positive regulation of Tor signaling (f), neural retina development (g), and NTMCP
  nonsense-mediated decay (h). Proteins involved in the enriched gene sets are labeled
  on the right of the heat map, and core regulated proteins in specific gene sets
  are labeled with red (upregulated) or blue (downregulated) according to the direction
  of change. The enrichment score (ES) value calculation process is shown on the upper
  part of the enrichment plots. The particularly pronounced peak represents the ES
  value of the enriched gene set. Each line in the middle of the enrichment plots
  represents a gene in the gene sets and its ranked position in the gene list. Red
  represents positive correlation with phenotype (high expression), blue means negatively
  correlated with phenotype (low expression). GSEA, gene set enrichment analysis;
  NTMCP, nuclear transcribed mRNA catabolic process; ES, enrichment score.
