caption: Expanding the function of GBM-directed CARs. Efforts to improve ACT against
  GBM can take different forms. Tandem CARs (TanCARs) can target two antigens simultaneously,
  something that can also be achieved by co-transduction of multiple individual CARs.
  Recent work has explored the possibility of generating CARs with non-scFv recognition
  domains. CARs using the CD27 or NKG2D ectodomains can target malignant cells expressing
  CD70 and NKG2DL, respectively. CARs using chlorotoxin (CLTX) as a binding motif
  have also been developed. Armored (or fourth generation) CARs aim to improve the
  effectiveness of ACT by engineering T cells so that, in addition to CARs, they express
  cytokines, BiTEs or cytokine receptors. Another approach is that of synNotch CARs,
  which repurpose elements of the Notch signalling pathway. A synNotch system can
  enable the controlled targeting of two antigens (AND gate), with the first CAR (red
  scFv) releasing the Notch intracellular domain upon antigen recognition, which in
  turn enables the production of a second CAR (blue scFv) recognizing a different
  antigen. Under this set up, the presence of both antigens is required to kill a
  target cell, reducing the risk of CAR T cells destroying healthy tissues.
