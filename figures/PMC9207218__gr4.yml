caption: 'Differences in molecular characteristics of three subtypes. A: Functional
  enrichment analysis shows the biological processes (BP) involved in two clusters
  of genes. B: Functional enrichment analysis shows the KEGG signaling pathway involved
  in two clusters of genes. C: KEGG network analysis of the first cluster of genes
  enriched by CSCP-L subtype. The cluster genes are mainly enriched in pathways such
  as metabolism and complement system. Most of them are down-regulated in tumors and
  may act as potential tumor suppressors such as CAT, G6PC and ABAT (refer to Fig.
  S6). D: KEGG network analysis of the second cluster of genes enriched by CSCP-H
  subtype. The cluster genes are mainly enriched in the ribosome, spliceosome and
  pyrimidine metabolism pathways. Most of them are up-regulated in tumors and may
  act as potential oncogenic factors such as RPL8, RPS21, RPL223A, RPL27, RPL38, NME1,
  SNRPA, SNRPC and SNRPE, etc. (refer to Fig. S6). The gene names included in Cluster
  1 and Cluster 2 refer to table S2.The size of the circle in the KEGG network represents
  the number of genes enriched in the pathway, and the color of the circle represents
  the difference fold of the gene. For space constraints in the figure, GO or KEGG
  descriptions that are too long in the figure are replaced by “…”, see supplementary
  table S3 and table S4 for full names.'
