caption: Prop inhibits U2OS cell migration, invasion and the epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition via autophagy through the activation of the adenosine monophosphate-activated
  protein kinase/FOXO1 signaling pathway. (A) Cell migration was analyzed using the
  wound healing assay. (B) Cell invasion was assessed using the Transwell assay. (C)
  N-cadherin, Vimentin and E-cadherin protein expression levels were detected via
  western blotting. Data are presented as the mean ± SD. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001.
  Prop, propofol.
