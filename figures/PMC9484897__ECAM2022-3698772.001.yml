caption: Effect of REA on the proliferation of EC cells. (a) Cell inhibition rates
  of Eca109 and KYSE150 cells were treated with REA with the concentration of 0, 10,
  20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 μmol/L for 24 h, 48 h, and  72h; (b, c) clone formation
  assay was performed to detect the proliferation viability of Eca109 and KYSE150
  cells treated with REA at concentrations of 0, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 μmol/L;
  (d) detection of proliferation viability of HEEC cells treated with REA at IC50
  concentrations of 61.336 μmol/L and 48.012 μmol/L. The data are expressed as the
  mean ± SD. Compared with the 0 μmol/L, ∗∗P < 0.05.
