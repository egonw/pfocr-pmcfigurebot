caption: RPL5 regulates colon cancer cell proliferation and migration through MAPK/ERK
  signaling pathway. A HCT116 and RKO cells were treated with RPL5-targeting siRNAs
  (siRPL5–1 and siRPL5–2) or negative control siRNA (siNC). After 48 h, cell lysates
  were harvested, and the protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. The levels of
  MAPK/ERK signaling pathway related proteins P-MEK1/2, MEK1/2, P-ERK, ERK, FOXO3
  and c-Myc were detected by western blotting. The band intensities of P-MEK1/2, MEK1/2,
  P-ERK, ERK, FOXO3 and c-Myc proteins were quantified relative to β-Tubulin and normalized
  to the siNC sample. The blots were cut prior to hybridization with antibodies during
  blotting. BTBHQ (50 μM) was added to HCT116 and RKO cells after 6 h transfection
  of siRPL5, and the proteins of each group were extracted 48 h later. Changes of
  proteins related to MAPK/ERK signaling pathway were detected by western blotting.
  The blots were cut prior to hybridization with antibodies during blotting. C HCT116
  and RKO cells were transfected with siRPL5 and then added TBHQ (20 μM) to detect
  the effect of TBHQ on the proliferation inhibition of colon cancer cells caused
  by siRPL5 at 24 h and 48 h. D HCT116 and RKO cells were transfected with siRPL5
  and then added TBHQ (20uM) to detect the effect of TBHQ on the inhibition of colon
  cancer cell migration caused by siRPL5 at 24 h and 48 h. (E) TBHQ (50 μM) was added
  to HCT116 and RKO cells after transfection of siRPL5 for 6 h, and cell cycle-related
  proteins (CDK4 and CyclinD1) and migration-related proteins (MMP2 and MMP9) were
  detected by western blotting. The band intensities of CDK4, CyclinD1, MMP2 and MMP9
  proteins were quantified relative to β-Tubulin and normalized to the siNC sample.
  The blots were cut prior to hybridization with antibodies during blotting. The data
  are representative of three independent experiments. (*P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, ***
