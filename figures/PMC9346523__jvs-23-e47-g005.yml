figure_title: Effects of AS-A2 on RANKL-stimulated osteoclast translational factors
  expression. RAW264.7 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of RANKL (50
  ng/mL) with AS-A2 (0 to10 μM), and the grown medium was changed on alternate days
  for six days. (A) The protein expression of TRAF6, cathepsin K, NFATc1, and c-Fos
  was evaluated using western blot. (B) The quantitative band density of proteins.
  The loading control was β-actin, and the results came from three separate trials
