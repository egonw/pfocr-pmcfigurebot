figure_title: Spd suppresses fibrotic signaling, but does not inhibit the endothelin
  pathway like bardoxolone methyl
caption: a Secretion of TGFβ1 from HK-2 cells treated with Spd measured by ELISA (n = 6
  in each group). Data are indicated as means ± SD. b Collagen 1 and c HO-1 mRNA expression
  determined by real-time PCR in HK-2 cells incubated with TGFβ1 in the presence of
  Spd (n = 3 in each group). Data are indicated as means ± SD. d MitoTracker Red CMXRos
  staining in HK-2 cells when exposed to H2O2 and Spd. Scale bar, 100 µm. e Quantification
  of Mitotracker Red CMXRos intensity measured by a multimode plate reader (n = 8
  in each group). Data are indicated as means ± SD. f HO-1 and g ET-1 mRNA expression
  determined by real-time PCR in HK-2 cells incubated with Spd and CDDO-me (n = 3
  in each group). Data are indicated as means ± SD. h Secretion of ET-1 from HK-2
  cells treated with Spd and CDDO-me measured by ELISA (n = 3 in each group). Data
  are indicated as means ± SD. **P < 0.01. NS not significant, Spd spermidine, TGFβ1
  transforming growth factor β1, CDDO-me bardoxolone methyl.
