caption: TRP redox channels modulate the migration of cancer cells. (1) ROS inhibits
  stress fibers and consecutively migration through the downregulating the DLC1/RhoA
  pathway. (2) Migration mediated by Src kinases. ROS stimulates Src, which in turn
  phosphorylates TRPV4 and TRPV7. TRPV4 channel contributes to migration via Src-cofilin
  intracellular pathway, while the TRPV7 kinase domain modulates Src phosphorylation.
  (3) Ca2+ entry via TRPM2 activates transcription factors HIF-1α1, E2F1, FOXM1, and
  CREB, which modulate the expression of α and β integrins. The proteins α and β integrin
  from the focal adhesion complex engage the extracellular matrix (ECM) in cell migration.
