caption: p‐STAT3 proteins in kidney tissue. (a) Representative immunoblots of the
  phosphorylated STAT3 (Tyr705) spliceforms, 94‐kDa p‐STAT3αY705 and 88‐kDa p‐STAT3βY705
  proteins. The relative optic densities (ODs) were calculated by normalizing the
  ODs of p‐STAT3α705 and p‐STAT3β705 to the OD of their corresponding non‐phosphorylated
  proteins levels STAT3αY705 and STAT3βY705 which were in turn normalized to β‐tubulin
  in the same blot. Data are mean ± SEM from 3 mice per group. (b) Immunohistochemical
  staining with p‐STAT3 protein in tubules. (c) Immunostaining for p‐STAT3 in renal
  corpuscles. Ten non‐overlapping fields for tubular and 10 non‐overlapping fields
  of renal corpuscle sections were imaged at 60X magnification from each kidney. OD
  data were quantified (n = 3 mice/group) and analyzed by two‐way ANOVA. a–d mean
  values with different letters are significantly different (p < 0.01). (d) Immunolocalization
  of p‐STAT3 (red) in kidney tubules. Meprin B (green) in WT and villin (green) in
  βKO were used as proximal tubule markers and DAPI (blue) was used to stain the nuclei.
  There were significant increases in protein levels of p‐STAT3α705 in both genotypes
  and p‐STAT3βY705 in βKO with increase total p‐STAT3 in tubules and renal corpuscle
  of both genotypes.
