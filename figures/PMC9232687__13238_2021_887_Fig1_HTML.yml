caption: Establishment of the transcriptional landscape of human stem cells and their
  derivatives under 39 °C heat stress. (A) A schematic of the workflow. The febrile
  temperature experiments were carried out in hESCs at early passages (between 50–60
  passages), in hVECs and hVSMCs at passage 2 or 3, in hMSCs at passage 4 or 5, in
  hNSCs at passage 6 or 7, in hCMs and hNeurons at approximate day 21 from differentiation.
  (B) Rose diagram showing the numbers of 39 °C hyperthermia-associated differentially
  expressed genes (hereafter referred as hyperthermia DEGs) in the indicated cell
  types. (C and D) GO term and pathway enrichment analysis based on upregulated (C)
  or downregulated (D) hyperthermia DEGs across seven cell types. The color key from
  red to gray (C), or from blue to gray (D) indicates P values from low to high, respectively.
  (E) Western blot analysis of HSP90AA1 expression across seven cell types under control
  (37 °C) and febrile temperature (39 °C) culture conditions. (F–H) Flow cytometric
  analysis of apoptosis in hESCs (F), hVECs (G) and hMSCs (H) under control (37 °C)
  and febrile temperature (39 °C) culture conditions. Data are shown as the mean ±
  SEM, n = 3; *P < 0.05. (I and J) Immunofluorescence analysis of Ki67 expression
  in hVECs (I) and hMSCs (J) under control (37 °C) and febrile temperature (39 °C)
  culture conditions. Data are shown as the mean ± SEM, n = 3, **P < 0.01, ***P <
  0.001. Scale bar, 25 µm. (K and L) Flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle in hVECs
  (K) and hMSCs (L) under control (37 °C) and febrile temperature (39 °C) culture
  conditions. Data are shown as the mean ± SEM, n = 3, ***P < 0.001. (M and N) Immunofluorescence
  analysis of 53BP1 and γH2AX expression in hVECs (M) and hMSCs (N) under control
  (37 °C) and febrile temperature (39 °C) culture conditions. Relative 53BP1 and γH2AX
  double-positive cells were calculated and are shown as the mean ± SEM, n = 3, *P
  < 0.05. Scale bar, 25 µm
