caption: 'STAT1 in the human gastric tissue proteomic cohort and immunohistochemistry
  and Western blot analysis of p-STAT1 and PD-L1 in gastric biopsies and gastric epithelial
  cells after H. pylori infection. (a) The expression of STAT1 in H. pylori-positive
  subjects and negative subjects, stratified by pathology. (b) STAT1 expression in
  gastritis (SG/CAG), advanced gastric lesions (IM/LGIN) and GC. (c) Kaplan–Meier
  curves of STAT1 in prognosis analysis of GC. (d,e) Immunohistochemistry staining
  of p-STAT1 and PD-L1 in human gastric biopsies (20× magnification). Healthy (n =
  10), Gastritis H.p− (n = 10), Gastritis EX-H.p+ (n = 10), Gastritis H.p+ (n = 9),
  IM (n = 8), GCD (n = 10), GCI (n = 10). Wilcoxon rank-sum test, ns, non-significant,
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, **** p < 0.0001. PD-L1 staining evaluation: <1%, negative;
  1–49% low; ≥50% high. (f) Western blot analysis of p-STAT1 and PD-L1 in NUGC4 and
  NCI-N87 negative controls and after 24 h H. pylori infection. IFN-γ (10 ng/mL) cells
  stimulated for 24 h were used as positive control. (g) Western blot analysis of
  p-STAT1 and PD-L1 in NUGC4 and NCI-N87 incubated 24 h with supernatants from non-infected
  or H. pylori-infected PBMCs for 24 h. GAPDH was used as loading control. Graphs
  show the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. Student’s t test, ns, non-significant,
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01. CAG, chronic atrophic gastritis; CI, confidence interval;
  EX-H.p+, previously H.p positive; GC, gastric cancer; GCD, diffuse-type gastric
  cancer; GCI, intestinal-type gastric cancer; H. p, Helicobacter pylori; HR, hazard
  ratio; iFOT, intensity-based fraction of total; IM, intestinal metaplasia; LGIN,
  low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia; NC, negative control; PBMCs, peripheral blood
  mononuclear cells; SG, superficial gastritis; Sup, supernatant.'
