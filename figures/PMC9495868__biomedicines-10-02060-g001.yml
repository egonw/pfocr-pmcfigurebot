caption: 'Study the expression of miR-30s in the PEO1 and A2780 cell lines. (A) Comparison
  of basal miR-30s expression in the PEO1 and A2780 cell lines. (B) Normalized expression
  of miR-30s in the PEO1 cell line in response to E2 treatment. (C) Normalized expression
  of miR-30s in the A2780 cell line in response to E2 treatment. The data are presented
  as the mean ± S.D. The ΔCt values were used to calculate statistical significance.
  a: p < 0.05; b: p < 0.01; c: p < 0.001; d: p < 0.0001.'
