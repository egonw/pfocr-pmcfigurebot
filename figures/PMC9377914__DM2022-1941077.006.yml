caption: (a and b) Western blotting revealed reductions in p-PI3K, p-AKT, p-mTOR,
  and CCND1 protein levels and increased PI3K, Akt, mTOR, and PTEN protein levels
  following the DDTC treatment of A2780 cells. (c) qRT-PCR was used to examine the
  effect of DDTC treatment on PI3K-AKT pathway-related gene expression within A2780
  cells. (d and e) Western blotting revealed reductions in p-PI3K, p-AKT, p-mTOR,
  and CCND1 protein levels as well as increases in PI3K, AKT, mTOR, and PTEN protein
  levels in SKOV3 cells following DDTC treatment. (f) qRT-PCR was used to examine
  the effect of DDTC treatment on PI3K-AKT pathway-related gene expression within
  SKOV3 cells. (g–i) Western blot and qRT-PCR indicated that p-PI3K/PI3K, p-AKT/AKT,
  p-mTOR/mTOR, and CCND1 were significantly downregulated and PTEN was upregulated
  at the mRNA and protein levels in A2780 cell-derived tumor xenografts following
  DDTC treatment relative to control PEG-400 treatment. ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 vs.
  control group. OC cells were treated with a range of DDTC doses (0.1, 1, and 10 μM).
