figure_title: Lipid metabolism and myelin associated transcriptional changes and reversal
  with mHtt lowering
caption: (a) Dotplot (clusterProfiler) of lipid or myelin related GO BP terms overrepresented
  (one sided hypergeometric test, padj<0.05) in 6-month LacQ140 downregulated genes
  (padj<0.05, FC>20%). GeneRatio represents the number of genes associated with each
  GO term/number of downregulated genes. Dots are sized by count of genes associated
  with respective terms. (b) Gene set enrichment analysis (clusterProfiler) of 6-month
  LacQ140, LacQ140_2M and LacQ140_A groups compared to WT. All lipid and myelin associated
  GO BP terms significantly enriched in LacQ140 compared to WT (padj<0.05) are displayed.
  X axis for each respective group represents the normalized enrichment score (NES)
  and bars are colored by significance (padj<0.05 = blue, padj>0.05 = tan). Adjusted
  p-values are displayed adjacent to bars. (c) Heatmap shows differentially expressed
  genes in 6-month-old LacQ140 mice compared to WT (padj<0.05, FC > ±20%). Gene expression
  is shown as median ratio normalized counts (DESeq2), scaled by respective gene (columns).
  Bars above the heatmap indicate DEGs reversed with mHtt lowering. LacQ140_2M = green,
  LacQ140_A = purple; padj<0.05, FC > 20% opposite of LacQ140. (d) Dotplot of lipid
  or myelin related GO BP terms overrepresented in 12-month downregulated genes. GO
  BP terms significantly overrepresented at 6-months (a) are displayed for comparison.
  4/9 terms (ensheathment of neurons, axon ensheathment, myelination, and phospholipase
  C activating G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway) are significantly overrepresented
  in 12-month LacQ140 downregulated genes (one sided hypergeometric test, padj < 0.05).
  (e) Gene set enrichment analysis of LacQ140, LacQ140_8M, LacQ140_2M and LacQ140_A
  groups compared to WT. GO BP terms enriched at 6-months (b) are displayed for comparison.
  8/22 GO BP terms are significantly negatively enriched (padj < 0.05) at 12-months,
  shown in blue. (f) Heatmap shows differentially expressed genes in 12-month-old
  LacQ140 mice compared to WT (padj<0.05, FC > ±20%). Gene expression is shown as
  median ratio normalized counts (DESeq2), scaled by respective gene (columns). Bars
  above the heatmap DEGs reversed with mHtt lowering (LacQ140_8M = bottom bar, no
  reversal, LacQ140_2M = green, LacQ140_A = purple; padj<0.05, FC >20% opposite of
  LacQ140). GO BP terms associated with genes, fold changes, and exact FDR values
  can be found in  & .
