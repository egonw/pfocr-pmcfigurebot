caption: RBM8A knockdown suppresses migration and invasion of breast cancer (BC) cells.
  (a) Wound-healing assay was used to measure the migration of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
  cells. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. sh-NC; (b and c) the migration and invasion of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
  cells were measured by transwell assay. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. sh-NC. Each experiment was
  repeated three times.
