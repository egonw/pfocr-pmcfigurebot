caption: SNORA38B was highly expressed in NSCLC and associated with poor prognosis.
  (A) Heatmap of differential gene expression in lung cancer tissues compared with
  adjacent normal tissues using TCGA database. Mapping by R software (V.4.0.2). (B)
  Six differentially expressed small nucleolar RNAs that associated with lung cancer
  stage and survival were screened out using Venn diagram. Mapping by R software.
  (C) Violin Plot of SNORA38B expression in tumor samples compared with adjacent normal
  samples using TCGA database. Mapping by R software. (D) Violin Plot of SNORA38B
  expression in different stages of NSCLC. Mapping by R software. (E–F) Representative
  images of SNORA38B expression in human lung/mouse tumor tissues and human/mouse
  lung tissues using RNAscope. Bar=50/100 µm. (G) Expression levels of SNORA38B in
  normal lung cell lines (16HBE, BEAS-2B, WI-38) and NSCLC cell lines (A549, 95D,
  SK-MES-1, H460, H520, H1299, H157, SPC-A-1, SK-LU-1 and H1975) were examined using
  qRT-PCR. (H) Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed the correlation between SNORA38B
  expression and patient prognosis. Mapping by R software. Assays were conducted in
  triple. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, means±SD was shown. Statistical analysis
  was performed by Student’s t-test, Kruskal-Wallis, one-way analysis of variance
  and the log-rank test. NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer; SNORNA, small nucleolar
  RNA; TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas.
