caption: Inhibition of APOC1 reversed the M2 phenotype to the M1 phenotype via the
  ferroptosis pathway in TAMs from HCC. (A) qRT-PCR results of M1/M2 phenotype gene
  expression in the sh-APOC1 and sh-NC group after of HCC cancer cell supernatant
  to TAM cells activation. (B)Volcano plot showing the differential genes in the TAM-APOC1
  cell cluster.(C)KEGG plot showing pathway enrichment of differentially down-expressed
  genes in TAM-APOC1 cell cluster.(D)KEGG plot showing pathway enrichment of differentially
  up-expressed genes in TAM-APOC1 cell cluster.(E) GSEA enrichment of differential
  genes in the TAM-APOC1 cell cluster.(F)Iron content in sh-NC and sh-APOC1 groups
  of TAM cells.(G)ROS content in sh-NC and sh-APOC1 groups of TAM cells.(H)Ferroptosis-associated
  protein expression in sh-NC and sh-APOC1 groups of TAM cells.(I)Electron micrograph
  in sh-NC and sh-APOC1 groups of TAM cells. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001,
  ****p < 0.0001.
