caption: 'RNA‐seq and q‐PCR test 1‐month post‐implantation. a–c) Significant gene
  expression changes of PEGDA/mock comparison (a) and slight changes of L30/mock comparison
  (b) in genes, and a list of top 10 upregulated genes and corresponding log2Fc (log2
  fold change) (c). d) KEGG pathway classification analysis of PEGDA/mock comparison
  and L30/mock comparison. e) Gene expression analysis of inflammatory factors in
  tissues surrounding the PEGDA and L30, with data normalized to the mock group (n = 3
  mice per group). f) qRT‐PCR analysis of mRNA expression for FBR‐related genes (n = 6
  mice per group, mean ± s.d.). Statistical significance was determined by one‐way
  analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Turkey post‐test. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001,
  ****p < 0.0001, ns: not significant.'
