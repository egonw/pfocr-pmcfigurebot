caption: Modulation of signaling pathways by SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. Coronavirus disease
  occurs upon entry of the virus through the airway and mouth and affects the lung
  initially because of the presence of the ACE2 receptors on the surface of type II
  alveolar cells that bind to the spike protein. The virus multiplies rapidly within
  the host cell and infects other cells by the interaction of TLR to PAMPs present
  on the surface of microbial cells. This triggers the activation NF‐κB pathway which
  is responsible for transcriptional induction of pro‐inflammatory cytokines through
  the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. It also activates TLR and TCR pathways in different
  innate immune cells. High levels of cytokines lead to mitochondrial malfunction.
  The deregulated NF‐κB pathway in these patients can cause extensive pulmonary endothelial
  cell injury and tissue damage that is central to the pathogenesis of ARDS. Also,
  when the virus binds to the ACE2 receptor on the host cell membrane, it causes downregulation
  of MAS and the ACE2 receptor in a COVID‐19 patient. The failure of the ACE2/Ang‐(1–7)/MAS
  pathway increases inflammation and contributes to tissue dysfunction, thrombosis,
  and fibrosis (Donoghue et al., ; Kuriakose et al., ).
