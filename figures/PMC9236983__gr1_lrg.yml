caption: Three features of IL-6 action. A. IL-6 signaling. IL-6 produced by various
  cells such as lymphocytes binds to IL-6 receptor (IL-6R). IL-6 cannot transduce
  intracellular signals and needs the assistance of transmembrane protein gp130. The
  IL-6/IL-6R complex binds to gp130 to form a hexameric structure, which in turn induces
  Box/JAK activation. Activation of tyrosine 759 of gp130 mediates the negative feedback
  loop formed by SOCS3 and JAK. The terminal four tyrosine residues of gp130 (Y767,
  Y814, Y905 and Y915) form the YXXQ motif necessary for STAT3 activation. B. Three
  features of IL-6R signaling. IL-6R includes mIL-6R expressed on the cell membrane
  surface and sIL-6R present in the circulatory system. IL-6/mIL-6R signaling is called
  classic signaling and mainly mediates the regenerative and protective effects. IL-6/sIL-6R
  signaling, known as trans-signaling, primarily mediates the pro-inflammatory effect.
  The recently discovered trans-presentation signaling pathway occurs mainly in the
  antigen-specific interaction of dendritic cells involved in IL-6 signaling and T
  cells receptive to IL-6.
