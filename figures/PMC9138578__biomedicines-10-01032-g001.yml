caption: 'Effects of empagliflozin on hepatic fibrosis in CDAHFD-induced mice. The
  mice were treated with the control chow diet (CD), choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined,
  high-fat diet (CDAHFD), or CDAHFD with empagliflozin (EMPA) treatment. (a) The liver
  histology was studied via macroscopic morphological examination, H&E staining, and
  Sirius Red staining. α-SMA signals were visualised via immunohistochemistry. (b)
  Fibrosis grades in the different groups. (c) α-SMA, fibronectin, and connective
  tissue growth factor (cTGF) signals were examined and quantified using Western blot.
  β-actin served as the loading control. (d) Relative expression of genes related
  to fibrosis was determined via RT-PCR. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001
  in the comparisons of the CD-fed mice with the CDAHFD-fed mice. † p < 0.05, †† p
  < 0.01, and ††† p < 0.001 in the comparisons of the CDAHFD-fed mice with the EMPA
  treatment groups. PV: portal vein; CV: central vein.'
