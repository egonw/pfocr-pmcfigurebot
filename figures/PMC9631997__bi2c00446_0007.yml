caption: 'Kinetics of abasic site bypass by apPol. (A) Acrylamide-urea gels depicting
  apPol-mediated single nucleotide incorporations in DNA substrate S3. Reactions were
  set up at 37°C with a final concentration of 104 nM active apPol, 100 nM substrate
  S3, and 250 μM of incoming dNTP (from left: dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP) and incubated
  for varying time intervals (0, 0.33, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 min) following which an excess
  of EDTA was added to quench the reactions before being analyzed on 15% acrylamide-urea
  gels. (B) Global fitting of the time courses from primer extension assays to determine
  the efficiencies of dATP incorporation by apPol opposite an abasic site and extension
  from the dAMP:abasic site basepair. Inset: Acrylamide-urea gel depicting the time
  course of primer extension with 500 μM dATP. +1 and +2: primer strand extended by
  one and two nucleotides, respectively. Single nucleotide primer extension assays
  were performed as described for (A) with the following changes. The incoming nucleotide
  was dATP for all the assays, and the concentration of the nucleotide was varied
  from 62.5 μM to 2 mM (62.5 μM: black, 125 μM: orange, 250 μM: magenta, 500 μM: green,
  1 mM: red, and 2 mM: blue), and the time interval for incubation ranged from 0 to
  20 min (0, 0.17, 0.33, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 min). Due to the sequence of the
  T0 and T1 nucleobases in substrate S3, we could detect two dATP addition events.
  The time courses show the combined product concentrations (i.e., the total of the
  +1 and +2 products). The smooth lines overlaying the datapoints are the best global
  fit of the data. (C) Kinetic pathway used for global fitting of dATP incorporation
  opposite the abasic site and extension past the lesion. The best fit rate constants
  are shown next to the corresponding steps. Rate constants shown in parenthesis were
  held constant during global fitting. K-5 and k6 were not individually constrained
  by the data; however, their ratio was well-constrained; therefore, only k6 is shown.
  S3n: Substrate S3 with 23 nucleotide long unextended primer strand. S3n+1 and S3n+2:
  S3 with a primer strand extended by one and two nucleotides, respectively. Pol′:
  apPol translocated by one nucleotide. (D,E) Global fitting of the +1 (D) and +2
  (E) products of (B) using model shown in (C). Experiments were performed in triplicate.
