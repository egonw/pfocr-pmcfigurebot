caption: RR inhibits osteoclast-specific genes expression levels. (a) The Raw264.7
  cells were stimulated with M-CSF and RANKL for 5 days, while adding indicated different
  concentrations of RR, the mRNA expression levels of osteoclast-specific genes, including
  NFATc1, ACP5, DC-STAMP, CTR, ATP6v0d2, and CTSK, were detected by qPCR, and normalized
  relative to GAPDH. (b) Raw264.7 cells were stimulated with M-CSF and RANKL for 5
  days, and 1.5 μM RR was added at the same time for 1 d, 3 d, and 5 d, respectively,
  and the osteoclast specific gene expression level was detected by qPCR. Data was
  presented as means ± SEM; n = 3; ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.
