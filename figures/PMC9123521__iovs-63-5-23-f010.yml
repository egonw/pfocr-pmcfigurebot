caption: 'HFD alters the neural-related transcriptome and the secretory functions
  of murine lacrimal glands. (A) Measurement of tear secretion in mice using phenol
  red threads after pilocarpine stimulation. (B) Temporal changes in tear secretions
  at different ZTs; n = 6 mice per group per time point (every 6 hours). One-way ANOVA
  using Bonferroni correction: *significant difference between NC-1 and HFD groups;
  #significant difference between NC-2 and HF-NC groups; ζsignificant difference between
  HFD and HF-NC groups. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001. Gray shading indicates
  dark phase. (C) Total tear secretions in a circadian cycle in NC-1, HFD, NC-2, and
  HF-NC mice; n = 24 mice per group. One-way ANOVA using Bonferroni correction: *significant
  difference between NC-1 and HFD groups; #significant difference between NC-2 and
  HF-NC groups; ζsignificant difference between HFD and HF-NC groups. ***P < 0.001,
  ****P < 0.0001; ns, not significant. (D) Heatmaps of the differentially expressed
  neural activity-related genes (fold change ≥ 1.50 or ≤ 0.67, BH-adjusted P < 0.05).
  The expression levels of these genes at different times of the day were obtained
  by RNA-Seq analysis of ELGs. The color bar indicates the scale for transcript expression
  from blue to yellow across eight time points, with the expression range normalized
  to ±2. (E) Annotation of differentially expressed neural activity-related genes
  from the KEGG pathway database (Q < 0.05). The top 10 annotated pathways are shown.
  The dashed lines represent Q = 0.05. (F) KEGG network diagram of differentially
  expressed neural activity-related transcripts. The circles represent transcripts.
  The color and size of the circles indicate the number of transcripts connected to
  each node. The darker the color and the larger the box, the more transcripts connected
  to the node. Differently colored lines represent different pathway classifications.
  The yellow, orange, and blue lines represent organismal systems, metabolism, and
  environmental information processing, respectively. (G) GSEA results showing the
  enrichment plots for the neurotrophin signaling pathway in the ELGs of NC-1 and
  HFD mice.'
