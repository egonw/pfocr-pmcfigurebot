caption: Infectious HDV model did not allow monitoring of virus-induced changes in
  redox pathways. HepaRGNTCP cells were infected with HDV, and the levels of infection
  were analyzed by immunostaining (a) or RT-qPCR (b) until 6 days post-infection (d.p.i.).
  (c) Transcription of ROS-generating and Nrf2-enzymes, as well as of UPR-dependent
  genes, was assessed by RT-qPCR. Graphs represent the means Â± S.D.
