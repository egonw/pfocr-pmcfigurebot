caption: 'Patient #1 imaging and immunostaining before and during treatment. (A) Patient
  #1 lower limbs cutaneous infiltrates. (B) Heart cine 4 cavity magnetic resonance
  imaging (MRI) revealing right atrial histiocytic infiltrate of patient #1 before
  treatment (arrows). (C) Patient #1 heart cine 4 cavity MRI with measure of inter-atrial
  infiltrate before cobimetinib treatment and (D) under cobimentinib treatment (1-year
  duration). (E) Patient #1 injected abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan before
  cobimetinib treatment (arrows), and (F) non-injected abdominal CT scan under cobimentinib
  treatment (1-year duration). (G) Patient #1 skin biopsy with CD163+ immunostaining
  (magnification x2.4) showing histiocytic infiltrates (arrows) before cobimetinib
  treatment and (H) under cobimentinib treatment (1-year duration). (I) Patient #1
  skin biopsy with p-S6 immunostaining (magnification x1.4), and (K) p-4EBP1 immunostaining
  (magnification x1.4) with mTOR pathway upregulation (arrows). (J) Patient #1 skin
  biopsy under cobimentinib treatment (1-year duration) with p-S6 immunostaining (magnification
  x1.4), and (L) p-4EBP1 immunostaining with disappearance of mTOR pathway upregulation
  (magnification x1.4). (M) Patient #1 pleural biopsy before treatment with CD163+
  immunostaining (magnification x1.2), (N) p-S6 immunostaining (magnification x1.2),
  and (O) p-4E-BP1 immunostaining (magnification x1.2). (P) Patient #1 skin biopsy
