caption: Maackiain promoted Nrf2 translocation dependent on PKC signaling. (a) PC12
  cells were treated with different concentrations of Maackiain (0, 10, 20, and 50 μM)
  for 12 hours. The levels of Nrf2 were determined using western blot analysis with
  GAPDH as loading control. (b) PC12 cells were treated with different concentrations
  of Maackiain (0, 10, 20, and 50 μM) or calphostin C (100 nM) 1 hour before 50 μM
  Maackiain stimulation. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to detect intracellular
  Nrf2 expression and location. Red fluorescence indicates Nrf2, and the nuclei were
  stained with DAPI (Blue).
