caption: 'ZCCHC12 facilitated cell migration and inhibition of it induced cell apoptosis
  and S-phase arrest in OS cells. (A–D), migration ability of cells was detected by
  Transwell migration assays (A and B) and wound-healing assays (C and D). (E–H),
  the quantifications of cell migration were presented by the column chart. (I) Flow
  cytometry images of the cell apoptosis and (J) column bar graph of apoptotic cells.
  (K) Cell cycle in HOS cells with ZCCHC12 knockdown and (L) percentages of cells
  in each cell cycle phase are shown in the bar graph. scale bar: 200 μm. n = 5; *P
  < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.'
