caption: 'TF3 reverses erastin-induced chondrocyte viability. (a) Chemical structure
  diagram of TF3. (b) Chondrocytes were treated with different concentrations of erastin
  (1 μM, 2 μM, 5 μM, 10 μM, and 20 μM) for 24 hrs. (c, d) Chondrocytes were treated
  with different concentrations of TF3 for 12 hrs or 24 hrs. (e) Chondrocytes were
  pretreated with TF3 (15 μM/30 μM) for 2 hours and then stimulated with erastin (5 μM)
  for 24 hrs. The results are presented as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments,
  and statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗p < 0.001. NC: negative control.'
