caption: GRIK3 expression modulated the tumor progression of NSCLC in vivo. A. Mice
  were subcutaneously injected with 1×106 vector cells and A549 cells with GRIK3 overexpression
  for a tumor growth assay. The mice were injected with 1×105 vector cells and A549
  cells with GRIK3 overexpression by the method of a tail vein injection. The lung
  tissues were collected on day 20 for conducting the metastatic tumor nodules assay.
  B. The tumor volume of subcutaneous vector cells and A549 mice with GRIK3 overexpression.
  C. The metastatic tumor nodules in lung tissues from mice were injected with 1×105
  vector cells and A549 cells with GRIK3 overexpression by the method of tail vein
  injection (day 20). The scale bar was 200 μm for H&E staining. D. Western blotting
  of GRIK3, UBE2C, CDK1, and Wnt-3a in tumor tissues subcutaneous vector and A549
  mice with GRIK3 overexpression. E. Immunostaining of Ki67 in tumor tissues subcutaneous
  vector and A549 mice with GRIK3 overexpression. The scale bar was 50 μm.
