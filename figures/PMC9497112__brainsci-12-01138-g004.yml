caption: 'Functional analysis for DEGs. (A,B) Heatmap shows DEGs between two clusters.
  Red points mean upregulated in cluster 1, turquoise points mean downregulation.
  (B) An analysis of pathway and process enrichment was conducted using the following
  ontologies: KEGG Pathway, GO Biological Processes, Reactome Gene Sets, Canonical
  Pathways, CORUM, TRRUST, DisGeNET, PaGenBase, Transcription Factor Targets, and
  COVID-19. Based on the graphical representation, the top 20 enrichments with p <
  0.01 were displayed. (C) Edges connect terms that have a similarity > 0.3.'
