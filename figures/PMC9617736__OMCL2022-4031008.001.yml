caption: PPI suppressed the proliferation of HCC cells. (a) Chemical structure of
  polyphyllin I. (b) A CCK-8 assay was performed to assess the inhibition ability
  of PPI on the proliferation of HepG2 and Huh-7 cells after incubation for 24, 48,
  and 72 h. (c) A colony formation assay was used to observe the long-term inhibitory
  effects of PPI against HCC cell lines. (d) Results of statistical analysis of the
  clonogenic assay. ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01vs. the control group.
