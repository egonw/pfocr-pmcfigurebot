caption: G-protein–dependent signaling via β-catenin. A, Without the presence of an
  agonist for EP2, G-proteins remain inactive and β-catenin is phosphorylated and
  picked up by a nucleosome for destruction. At the same time, glycogen synthase I
  remains inactive and no glycogen is produced. B, The presence of PGE2 activates
  the αs guanosine triphosphate (GTP) subunit and releases β-catenin and GSK-3β from
  Axin. During this time, the free βγ subunits activate the PI3K-PDK1-AKT signaling
  pathway, resulting in the inhibitory phosphorylation of the free GSK-3β. GYS1 is
  then enabled to conduct glycogen synthesis without inhibition from GSK-3β. Without
  GSK-3β to inhibit it, the released β-catenin is allowed to undergo nuclear translocation,
  promoting gene expression and cell growth. AKT, Protein kinase B; APC, Adenomatous
  polyposis coli protein; CK1, casein kinase 1; GDP, guanosine diphosphate; GSK-3β,
  glycogen synthase kinase-3β; GYS1, glycogen synthase 1; LEF, lymphoid enchancer
  factor; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; TCF, T-cell factor.
