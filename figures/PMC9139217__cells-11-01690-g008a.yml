caption: Cisplatin increased apoptosis and downregulated the MT1, MT2, and SIRT1/Nrf2
  signaling pathways in Leydig cells. (A) CCK8 was used to determine the relative
  cell survival of Leydig cells after treatment with various doses of cisplatin for
  24 h. (B) CCK8 was used to determine the relative cell viability of Leydig cells
  treated with 8 μg/mL of cisplatin for different lengths of time. (C) Images of Leydig
  cells treated with various doses of cisplatin for 24 h. (D) Apoptosis was observed
  by flow cytometry analysis in Leydig cells treated with various doses of cisplatin
  for 24 h. (E) Apoptotic cell percentages are shown. (F) Determination of MT1 and
  MT2 protein levels was performed by Western blotting in Leydig cells treated with
  various doses of cisplatin for 24 h. The blots were quantified using Image J software.
  (G) Determination of the Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 protein levels was performed by Western
  blotting in Leydig cells treated with various doses of cisplatin for 24 h. The blots
  were quantified using Image J software. (H) Determination of SIRT1, SOD1, and SOD2
  protein levels was performed by Western blotting in Leydig cells treated with various
  doses of cisplatin for 24 h. The blots were quantified using Image J software. CP,
  cisplatin. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM (N = 4 per group). * p < 0.05 or
  ** p < 0.01 compared with controls.
