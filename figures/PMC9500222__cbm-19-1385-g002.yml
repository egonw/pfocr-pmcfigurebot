caption: Caspase-8K14R inhibits lung cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. (A)
  CCK8 assays were performed to observe the proliferation of A549 and SPCA1 cells
  after transfection with plasmids containing the rs3769823[A] or rs3769823[G] allele.
  (B) Colony formation assays were used to investigate the differences in colony formation
  ability after transfection with the constructed plasmids into A549 and SPCA1 cells.
  (C) EdU incorporation assays were performed to assess the proliferation of A549
  and SPCA1 cells after transfection with the constructed plasmids. (D) Transwell
  assays were conducted to determine the migration of A549 and SPCA1 cells (*P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01).
