caption: 'Percentage of tetraploid plants obtained from different treatments: 0.3%
  colchicine for 6 hours at 2-leaf stage (dotted bars), 0.1% colchicine for 6 hours
  at 4-leaf stage (hatched bars), and 0.3% colchicine for 6 hours at 4-leaf stage
  (black bars). The treatments with different letter on top are significantly different
  based on Duncan’s test by 0.01 significant level.'
