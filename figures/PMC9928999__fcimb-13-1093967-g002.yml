caption: To maintain ecological balance, intestinal protective elements resist extra-intestinal
  microbes in the oral-derived microbiome dysbiosis. In the intestine, the enteral
  translocation of periodontopathic bacteria brings about gut microbiota dysbiosis
  and intestinal inflammation, thus weakening the intestinal surface liquids and junctional
  components (; ). While interacting with the host’s immune system, via enteral route
  or hematogenous route, oral-derived pathogens regulate the constitution and transformation
  of immune cells, guiding the transition of the intestinal microenvironment from
  a healthy state to a pre-disease state. In regard to cell signaling pathways, cells
  of Paneth autonomously sense a series of oral metabolites via MyD88-dependent toll-like
  receptor (TLR), then stimulate antimicrobial cytokines and trigger the downstream
  NF-kB pathway, which subsequently regulates the production of a series of inflammatory
  cytokines (; ).
