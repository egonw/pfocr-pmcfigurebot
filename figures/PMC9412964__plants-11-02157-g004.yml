caption: Effects of the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) on starch synthesis.
  (A) WT and atg5 mutant Physcomitrella cells cultured on BCDAT agar medium were transferred
  to BCDATG liquid medium and cultured for a further 7 d under light conditions, during
  which their starch content was measured. (B) WT Physcomitrella colonies grown on
  a BCDAT agar medium were transferred to a BCDATG liquid medium containing 5 mM of
  3-MA or water (as a solvent control) and cultured under light conditions. The starch
  content of colonies was measured 2 d after transfer. (A,B) Data are shown as means
  Â± SD (n = 3, *** p < 0.005).
