caption: 'Knockdown of TRIM52 suppresses cell proliferation, migration, and regulation
  in colon cancer cells. NC: HCT116 cells transfected with negative control. si-TRIM52
  002: cell line transfected with TRIM52 gene off SiRNA002. si-TRIM52 003: cell line
  transfected with TRIM52 gene off SiRNA003. *, P<0.1; **, P<0.01; ****, P<0.0001.
  (A) The knockdown effect of Si-TRIM52 on TRIM52 in HCT116 started to show at 24
  h after transfection, lasting at least 72 h. (B) HCT116 cells were spread 2,000
  cells per well in 96-well plates, 6 replicate wells were transfected with siRNA
  at a concentration of 100 NM, and the absorbance at 450 nm was measured by CCK-8
  cell proliferation assay kit, 6 values were averaged, and the curve was plotted
  against the OD value. (C) HCT116 cell line was transfected with TRIM52 gene off
  SiRNA and NC control for 24 hours, after digesting 50,000 cells were added to each
  Transwell upper chamber, 500 µL of medium containing 10% FBS was added to the lower
  chamber, incubated overnight in the incubator, fixed in methanol, stained with 0.1%
  crystalline violet, and the cells were observed under the microscope and photographed.
  (D) Diluted Matrigel was added to the bottom of the upper chamber of each Transwell
  and completely solidified. 50,000 cells were added to the upper chamber and 500
  µL of medium containing 10% FBS was added to the lower chamber, incubated overnight
  in the incubator, fixed in methanol, stained with 0.1% crystalline violet, and photographed
  under the microscope. (E) HCT116 cells were transfected by SiR-TRIM52 003, fixed
  overnight in 75% cold ethanol, and flow cytometric detection of fluorescence intensity
  after PI staining. Statistical analysis of the data was performed. (F) HCT116 cells
  were transfected by SiTRIM52 for 24 h. Fluorescence intensity was measured by flow
  cytometry after collecting supernatant and double staining of all cells with PI/Annexin
  V-FITC in the appressed wall. Statistical analysis of data was performed. CCK-8,
  Cell Counting Kit-8; siRNA, small interfering RNA; OD, optical density; FBS, fetal
  bovine serum; PI, propidium iodide.'
