figure_title: Schematic representation of the T-loop organization. The telomere DNA
  loops back on itself, forming the T-loop. The 3’ G strand extension invades the
  duplex telomeric repeats and forms a D-loop. During the organization, the telomeric
  DNA is bound by the specialized shelterin complex and packaged into a t-loop configuration.
  The shelterin complex is organized by TRF1, TRF2, TIN2, RAP1, TPP1, and POT1. The
  six-subunit proteins protect the chromosome ends from the DNA damage signaling pathway
  and DNA repair mechanisms
