caption: Expression of P38 signalling pathway proteins and downstream molecules after
  transfection of ZCCHC14‐KO plasmids into A549 and H1299 cells. Treated group transfected
  with ZCCHC14‐KO plasmids into cancer cells and their control cells were probed with
  antibodies against ZCCHC14, P38, p‐P38, cyclinD1 and MMP‐7. GADPH was used as a
  loading control. Data of P38 signalling pathway proteins and downstream molecules
  are shown as bar graphs depict mean ± SD Experiments were repeated three times

  cancer through the MAPK‐P38 signalling pathway.
