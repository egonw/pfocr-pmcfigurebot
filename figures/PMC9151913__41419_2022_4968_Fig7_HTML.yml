figure_title: Downregulation of GBA1 is correlated with a high level of GlcCer, activation
  of the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway, and a high capacity for human liver cancer
  metastasis
caption: A The levels of GlcCer in human liver cancer tissues (T, n = 3) and paired
  adjacent nontumorous liver tissue (ANLT, n = 3). The data on every pair of liver
  cancer tissues are shown as concentrations of GlcCer. B The level of GlcCer in human
  liver cancers with metastatic lesions (MHs) and nonmetastatic lesions (NMHs). The
  data are shown as the concentration of GlcCer. C The expression of GBA1 protein
  in human liver cancers (T) with metastatic lesions (case 1-MH) and no-metastatic
  lesions (case 2-NMH, case 3-NMH) and paired adjacent nontumorous liver tissue (ANLT),
  scale bar, 100 μm. D Western blotting was performed to determine the expression
  of Wnt signalling proteins and EMT markers in human liver cancers with metastatic
  lesions (MHs) and nonmetastatic lesions (NMHs). E Schematic depiction of the underlying
  mechanisms of low GBA1 promotes metastasis of liver cancer. Downregulation of GBA1
  expression in liver cancer cells induces an increase in GlcCer in the plasma membrane,
  and the reprogramming of GlcCer, which are mainly located in lipid rafts, leads
  to the enhancement of LRP6. LRP6 is a co-receptor in the Wnt/β-catenin signalling
  pathway, and increasing the LRP6 level in the plasma membrane induces activation
  of the Wnt signalling pathway. Reports have shown that activating receptors, including
  phosphorylation of LRP6, leads to the recruitment of the DVL protein to the plasma
  membrane, induction of multimerization of the receptor complex and recruitment of
  components of the β-catenin destruction complex []. Subsequently, the proteolysis
  of β-catenin is inhibited, and non-phospho-β-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm
  and is then translocated into the nucleus, as shown in this study. Then, the expression
  of EMT-associated genes and Wnt target genes is upregulated and the metastasis of
  liver cancer cells is promoted.
