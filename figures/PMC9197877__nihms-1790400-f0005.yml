caption: 'DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) (see Glossary) are dangerous because they
  often lead to genomic instability. Cells have developed multiple pathways to repair
  DSBs (reviewed in [,]), which can be divided into two main groups: non-homologous
  end joining (NHEJ) (see Glossary) and homologous recombination (HR) ( ). NHEJ joins
  the two broken ends by ligation, whereas HR uses homologous DNA as a template to
  copy sections of DNA needed to repair the break. During two of the HR pathways,
  synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) and the double Holliday junctions (dHJs)
  repair pathway, both sides of the broken molecule recognize a homologous region,
  which leads to strand invasion and copying of a short region of homologous DNA defined
  by the position of the homologous interactions (). The third HR pathway, break-induced
  replication (BIR), is used when only one end of the DSB successfully invades a homologous
  site within the genome (; ), which is followed by extensive DNA synthesis (reviewed
  previously in [–]). Studies in yeast have demonstrated that DNA copying during BIR
  can continue for ~100 kb and through the telomere [–]. BIR synthesis occurs within
  a migrating replication bubble that is driven by branch migration of an unresolved
  Holliday junction, which leads to conservative inheritance of newly synthesized
  DNA [,,]. This unusual type of DNA synthesis is largely responsible for the genetic
  instabilities associated with BIR, including a 100- to 1000-fold increase in mutation
  frequency compared to S-phase replication [,–], as well as a high level of chromosome
  rearrangements [,–]. Moreover, in systems where BIR was induced in the presence
  of DNA-damaging agents, mutation clusters resembling those reported in human cancer
  genomes were induced [,]. It has further been demonstrated that BIR promotes template
  switching that can lead to complex genome rearrangements [,,] similar to the chromothripsis
  events reported in cancer (reviewed in [–]). These observations that BIR promotes
  particular cancer-like genetic instabilities implicate BIR as a mechanism that might
  lead to cancer. A potential role for BIR in cancer etiology is also supported by
  work demonstrating that oncogene over-expression in human cells can induce BIR-driven
  segmental duplications [] , another molecular phenotype associated with tumors (reviewed
  in []), as well as by mutation patterns consistent with BIR that were reported in
  cancer genomes []. Finally, the finding that ~15% of cancers employ alternative
  lengthening of telomeres (ALT), a BIR-like mechanism, for telomere maintenance (reviewed
  in [,,,]) lends additional support to the relevance of BIR in cancer development.'
