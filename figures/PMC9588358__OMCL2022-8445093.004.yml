caption: NGF/TrkA activated the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and enhanced the interaction
  between PC cells and DRG cells. (a)Western blotting was employed to test the levels
  of PI3K, p-AKT, and p-mTOR in MiaPaCa-2 cells treated with 100 ng/ml of NGF or/and
  transfected with TrkA siRNA for 48 h. (b-e) Transwell was used to detect migration
  and invasion of DGR or MiaPaCa-2 cells treated with 100 ng/ml of NGF or/and transfected
  with TrkA siRNA for 48 h. (f) Schematic of MiaPaCa-2 and DGR invasion. (g) DRG growth
  index. (h) Neuroinvasion index. N = 3, ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01.
