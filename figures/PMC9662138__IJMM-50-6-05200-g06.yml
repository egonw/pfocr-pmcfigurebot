caption: Effects of ATF6 on angiogenesis of CMECs via the STAT3/VEGF signaling pathway.
  (A) Immunofluorescence staining for CD31 in CMECs; DAPI was used to stain the nucleus.
  (B) Protein expression levels of CD31, p-eNOS, eNOS and ET-1 were determined by
  western blotting analysis. (C) NO serum levels were determined using an NO kit.
  (D and E) Angiogenesis tube formation assay. Each experiment was repeated at least
  three times. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001. CMEC, cardiac microvascular endothelial
  cell; eNOS, endothelial NO synthase; ET-1, endothelin-1; GADD45A, growth arrest
  and DNA damage-inducible α; H/R, hypoxia/reoxygenation; NC, negative control; NO,
  nitric oxide; p-, phosphorylated; siRNA, small interfering RNA.
article_title: Role of GADD45A in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion through mediation
  of the JNK/p38 MAPK and STAT3/VEGF pathways.
