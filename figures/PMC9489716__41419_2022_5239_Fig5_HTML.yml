figure_title: Elevated activity of Hif-1 signaling pathway in Hnrnpk null chondrocytes
  increases glycolytic intensity
caption: 'A mRNA fold changes of target genes of Hif-1 signaling pathway of E18.5
  CKO growth plate cartilage compared to WT according to RNA-seq results. B mRNA expression
  level of key enzymes of oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis of E18.5 WT and
  CKO growth plate cartilage (left panel). Protein level of Pfkfb3 and Ldha of E18.5
  WT and CKO growth plate cartilage (right panel). Red boxes: most active glycolytic
  enzymes in chondrocytes. n = 3 biological replicates. Densitometry results were
  expressed as fold change in protein levels compared with WT1 after normalized to
  β-actin. C mRNA expression level of key enzymes of oxidative phosphorylation and
  glycolysis of Hnrnpkfl/fl chondrocytes infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-Cre under normoxic
  or hypoxic conditions. Statistical analysis was exerted between Hypoxia Ad-GFP and
  Hypoxia Ad-Cre. n = 3 biological replicates. D Protein level of Vegfa, Ldha, and
  Pfkfb3 of Hnrnpkfl/fl chondrocytes infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-Cre under normoxic
  or hypoxic conditions. Densitometry results were expressed as fold change in protein
  levels compared with chondrocytes infected with Ad-GFP under normoxic condition
  after normalized to β-actin. E Protein level of Hif1α, Ldha, and Pfkfb3 of Hnrnpkfl/fl
  chondrocytes treated with DMSO or Chetomin after being infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-Cre
  under hypoxic condition. Densitometry results were expressed as fold change in protein
  levels compared with chondrocytes infected with Ad-GFP under hypoxic condition after
  normalized to β-actin. F Glucose consumption, lactate production, and ratio of lactate/glucose
  of Hnrnpkfl/fl chondrocytes infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-Cre under normoxia or hypoxic
  conditions. n = 3 biological replicates. G Diagram indicated the strategy of treating
  Hnrnpkfl/fl chondrocytes with PBS or 3-BrPA after being infected with Ad-GFP or
  Ad-Cre under hypoxic condition. H mRNA expression level and protein level of Sox9
  and Mmp13 in Hnrnpkfl/fl chondrocytes treated with PBS or 3-BrPA after being infected
  with Ad-GFP or Ad-Cre under hypoxic condition. n = 3 biological replicates. Densitometry
  results were expressed as fold change in protein levels compared with chondrocytes
  infected with Ad-GFP under hypoxic condition after normalized to β-actin. p-value
  was calculated by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons tests (C,
  F, H) or two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test (B). Data were shown as mean ± SD.
