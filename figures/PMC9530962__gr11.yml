caption: 'LYC inhibited the activation of the nuclear translocation NF-κB signaling
  pathway of Nrf2 and the effects of apoptosis. A–B: Western-blot detected the protein
  expression of BAX, BCL-2, Cleaved-Caspase3, NF-κB-p65 and TNF-α. C, G: Immunofluorescence
  detected the expression of NF-κB-p65 in NRK52E cells. "Yellow arrow" indicating
  positive expression; "Red arrow" indicating extranuclear expression. The positive
  expression areas were quantified. D–E: Western-blot detected the protein expression
  of BAX, BCL-2, Cleaved-Caspase3, NF-κB-p65 and TNF-α. F: NRK52E cells were treated
  with the drug for 24 h. DAPI staining was used to assess nuclear chromatin changes
  (apoptosis). "Yellow arrow" indicated fragmented nuclei; "White arrow" indicated
  condensed chromosomes; "Purple arrow" indicated marginalized chromosome condensation;
  "red arrow" indicated shrunken nuclei. (For interpretation of the references to
  color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)'
