caption: Inhibitory effect of PBE on osteoclastogenesis is mediated through the JNK
  signaling pathway. BMMs were cultured with RANKL (100 ng/mL) and M-CSF (30 ng/mL)
  for 4 days. Then, the cells were pretreated with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (20
  μM) for 30 min, followed by stimulation with or without PBE at a concentration of
  50 μM. (A) Western blotting was performed to analyze the protein expression levels
  of p-JNK, JNK, c-Fos, and NFATc1. (B) Protein bands were quantified using Image
  J software. Bars labeled with different subscripts indicate significant differences
  (# p < 0.001 vs. RANKL untreated group (NC; normal control), ** p < 0.005 vs. RANKL
  treated group (PC; positive control), *** p < 0.001 vs. PC). Data are presented
  as mean ± SD from at least three independent experiments (n = 3).
