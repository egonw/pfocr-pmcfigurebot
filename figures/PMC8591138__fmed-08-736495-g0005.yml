caption: Significant miR-metabolic pathway interconnecting paths/network in cervical
  cancer. (A) represents a significant miRNA metabolic interaction network, (B) shows
  the miRNA to metabolic pathway interconnectivity, and (C) shows the significant
  miRNA to metabolic paths regulating metabolites in cervical cancer. Terminal miRNAs
  and metabolic enzymes are colored in red and blue. Protein-protein interactors are
  colored in orange. Gene regulatory edges are represented as black arrows and protein-protein
  interactions are represented by orange edges. Nodes with an asterisk (*) are key
  or effector nodes in the significant paths/network.
