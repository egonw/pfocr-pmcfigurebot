caption: Body mass parameters by Dual Energy X-rat Absorptiometry (DXA) and serum
  Mg concentration of SAMP8 mice. (A) Serum Mg levels in Con group showed a decreasing
  trend from month 2 to month 4, and serum Mg concentration in the Mg group was significantly
  higher than in the Con group at month 4. (B) Representative DXA images in lean mass
  mode. (C) Lean mass, (D) lean mass percentage, (E) appendicular lean mass and (F)
  appendicular lean mass percentage of SAMP8 mice in different groups at month 2,
  3 and 4 post treatment. Lean mass in the Mg group was significantly higher than
  in the Con group at month 4. Mg + VIB group showed a significantly higher lean mass/percentage
  and appendicular lean mass/percentage compared with the Con group at month 2, and
  the VIB group showed significantly higher mass/percentage and appendicular lean
  mass/percentage compared with the Con group at month 3 and significantly higher
  lean mass percentage and percentage lean mass at month 4. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001, n = 3â€“5.
