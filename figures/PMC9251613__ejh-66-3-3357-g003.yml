caption: HMGB1 induces the production of MMP13, ADAMTS5, IL-1β and IL-6 through activating
  NF-κB signaling pathway in TMJOA synovial fibroblasts. A,B) Western blotting analysis
  of expression of MMP13 and ADAMTS5 in synovial fibroblasts treated with HMGB1 (100
  ng/mL) or NF-κB inhibitor (50 μM). C,D) ELISA assay was to assay the secretion of
  IL-1β and IL-6 in the supernatants harvested from synovial fibroblasts treated with
  HMGB1 or NF-κB inhibitor; data are shown as the means with 95% CI and are analyzed
  using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), n=9, ***p<0.001.

  joint osteoarthritis via NF-κB signaling pathway.
