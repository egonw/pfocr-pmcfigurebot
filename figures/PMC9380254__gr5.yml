caption: Remodeled GR sites associate with genes showing altered glucocorticoid response(A)
  Liver RNA-seq in vehicle-treated Hnf4afl/flAlbCre, LKO versus LWT samples. Significantly
  downregulated genes (FDR < 0.05) in red, significantly upregulated genes in blue
  (n = 3–4 biological replicates/group).(B) Top Reactome pathways of genes downregulated
  (red) and upregulated (blue) by HNF4A loss. Point size is proportional to number
  of genes in that pathway. P value from hypergeometric test, Benjamini Hochberg adjusted.(C)
  Effect of DEX treatment in LWT and LKO mice (n = 3–4 biological replicates/group).
  Genes where stageR detects a significant treatment × genotype interaction shown
  in gray (1,908 genes). Those where direction of change is different between genotypes,
  and where effect of treatment is significant, highlighted in purple (633 genes).
  These include notable metabolic regulators and enzymes, highlighted in green. FC,
  fold change.(D) Enrichment of gene clusters at increasing distances from sites where
  GR binding and chromatin accessibility is lost or gained in Hnf4afl/flAlbCre LKO
  mice (hypergeometric test). First cluster comprises those 1,908 genes where stageR
  detects a treatment-genotype interaction, other clusters comprise random samples
  of equivalent size (repeated four times) of DEX-responsive genes where no treatment-genotype
  interaction is detected. Shading of each heatmap cell corresponds to –log10(p value)
  for enrichment, number indicates number of genes in each cluster at that distance.(E)
  Exemplar tracks showing GR ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq signals around the Klf3, Jun, Slc2a4,
  and Fos loci in LWT and LKO liver. Sites of lost GR binding and chromatin accessibility
  indicated with navy arrows, sites of gained GR binding and chromatin accessibility
  indicated with orange arrows. The y axis is uniform within each panel.(F) Hepatic
  expression of Forkhead box factor genes in Hnf4afl/flAlbCre LKO compared with LWT
  mice. FDR, false discovery rate. See also  and .
