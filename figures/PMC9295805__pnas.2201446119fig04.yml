caption: 'The complex spatial organization of GSO pathway components is necessary
  for controlled tapetum development. (A–C) SEM images and histological cross-section
  of anthers of the pAMS:GSO1-ΔKinase line. Phenotype confirmed in seven independent
  lines. (D–F) SEM images and histological cross-section of anthers of the pAMS:GSO1
  line. Phenotype confirmed in five independent lines. (G) Taken together, our data
  support the following model for the coordination of pollen wall formation with tapetum
  development. The CIF precursors produced in the tapetum are processed by the pollen-derived
  SBTs. The activated peptides diffuse between tapetum cells to bind GSO receptors
  in the middle layer, which induces downstream signaling, leading to polarized sporopollenin
  secretion toward the pollen grains. The completion of the pollen wall on the pollen
  surface prevents the interaction of SBTs with their substrates thus attenuating
  signaling. The anther cross-sections are stained with acriflavine. Scale bars: 10
  µm.'
