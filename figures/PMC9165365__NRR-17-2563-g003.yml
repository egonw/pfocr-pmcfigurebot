caption: 'Schematic representation of the involvement of apoptosis in neurological
  disorders.Neurological disorders including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s
  disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and epilepsy are characterized by a common
  feature the apoptosis. In all these diseases, intrinsic apoptosis ultimately leads
  to cell death by the release of mitochondrial content to the cytoplasm involving
  BAK/BAX and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). These events promote
  the release of Cytochrome c and the formation of apoptosome inducing the activation
  of cell death effectors like Caspase-3. Events leading to cell death vary among
  the different pathologies. In AD, the apoptotic pathway is linked to the mitochondrial
  accumulation of Aβ-oligomers and tau inclusions which leads to mitochondrial dysfunction
  allowing the activation of the cell death pathway. In PD, the increase of oxidative
  stress induces the formation of α-synuclein (α-syn) radical promoting the release
  of cytochrome C and triggering mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. In MS, activated
  immune cells, through the release of inflammatory products, promote the activation
  of caspase-8 which in turn promotes the truncation of BID into t-BID. t-BID represents
  the point of connection between extrinsic and intrinsic pathways promoting BAK/BAX
  pore formation and ultimately Caspase-3 activation. In epilepsy, the apoptotic pathway
  is induced by the excessive stimulation of glutamate receptors. This event results
  in mitochondrial Ca2+-overload and ultimately apoptotic neuronal cell death. The
  involvement of apoptosis in neurological disorders is widely described in the main
