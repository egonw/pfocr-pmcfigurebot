caption: TOF promotes neuron survival and ameliorates neuronal apoptosis after SCI.
  (A) Immunofluorescent images of NeuN (green) showing the arrangement of neurons
  on day 14 post-injury. The boxed areas represent representative images of injured
  (left) and uninjured (right) area. Two bottom rows are the enlarged images of the
  injured and uninjured area in different group. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI
  (blue). Scale bar, 200 μm and 50 μm. (B) Western blot analysis performed for cleaved-caspase3,
  Bcl-2 and Bax expression in spinal cord obtained on day 14 post-injury. (C) Quantification
  of cleaved-caspase3 protein expression level and the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax (The values
  are presented as mean ± SD; **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, one-way ANOVA; n = 3 rats per
  group). (D) Immunofluorescent images of the apoptosis marker Cleaved-Caspase3 (green)
  in the damage area on day 14 post-injury. Magnifications of the boxed regions are
  shown on the right. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). Scale bar, 200
  μm and 20 μm. (E) Quantification analysis of the number of NeuN+ and Cleaved-Caspase3+
  cells obtained from 3 ROIs (The values are presented as mean ± SD; **p<0.01, ***p<0.001,
  Student's t tests; n = 3).
