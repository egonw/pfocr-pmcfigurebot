figure_title: Mfn2R707W causes an adipose-tissue-specific induction of the integrated
  stress response
caption: 'qPCR of genes involved in the integrated stress response (ISR) for six tissues
  from animals fed chow diet for 6 months: Atf4 (A), Ddit3 (Chop, B), and Atf5 (C).
  Each data point represents one animal. Target gene CT values were normalised to
  three housekeeping genes (36b4, B2m, and Hprt) and expressed relative to WT liver
  for each gene. WT in blue, homozygous Mfn2R707W in green. p-values are FDR-adjusted
  for multiple tests. Western blots from BAT (D), epididymal WAT (E), and liver (F)
  illustrating Ser51-phosphorylation of eIF2α and expression of Mthfd2 with calnexin
  (Canx) as loading control. Western blots are representative of at least three biological
  and technical replicates. (G) Volcano plot from bulk RNA sequencing (n=8 per genotype)
  of inguinal WAT from mice on HFD. Significantly differentially expressed genes (Log2
  fold change >1.5 and p-FDR <0.001) are highlighted in orange. Pathway analysis using
  significantly differentially expressed genes for upregulated (H) and downregulated
  (I) Hallmark gene sets. The X-axis depicts a relative gene set enrichment score.
  All illustrated gene sets are enriched with p-FDR <0.05. Asterisks indicate p-values
  from pairwise comparisons (T-tests) between WT and Mfn2R707W KI that are FDR-adjusted
  for multiple tests (* p-FDR <0.05, ** p-FDR <0.01, *** p-FDR <0.001, **** p-FDR
  <0.0001). Figure 4—source data 1.Raw and annotated immunoblots from .'
