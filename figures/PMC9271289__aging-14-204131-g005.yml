caption: 'HDAC inhibitors trigger CRT translocation to the nucleus in liver cancer
  cells overexpressing CRT. (E–G) HCC cells treated with vehicle, transfected with
  CRT-plasmid, or HDAC inhibitors alone or in combination exhibit DNA damage, as determined
  by TUNEL assays. Scale bar = 100 μm. Upper panel: Green fluorescence indicates CRT-transfected
  HCC cells. HCC cells are stained with fluorescein-labeled dUTP according to the
  protocols reported in the Methods section. Red fluorescence indicates TUNEL-positive
  cells. Lower panel: HCC cells in the upper panel are stained with 4'',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
  (DAPI) to identify cell nuclei. (H) Rate of apoptosis is calculated as the percentage
  of TUNEL-positive cells among the total number of counted parental and resistant
  cells (mean ± SD, n = 3). (I–K) Cells are seeded in an 8-well chamber and treated
  with vehicle, CRT-plasmid, or HDAC inhibitors alone or in combination. HDAC inhibitors
  trigger CRT translocation to the nucleus and stimulate calcium accumulation, analyzed
  by confocal microscopy. Scale bar = 10 μm. Mean values are significantly different
  than that in control group. *p< 0.05, **p< 0.01, ***p< 0.001.'
