caption: Main pathophysiological roles of α‐synuclein (blue) and β‐synuclein (purple)
  in neurons. (A) In the neuronal body, α‐synuclein participates in mitochondrial
  functioning and motility, contributing to redirecting damaged mitochondria to mitophagy.
  When this pathway is impaired, misfolded α‐synuclein may induce accumulation of
  dysmorphic organelles (ie, mitochondria) and formation of neuronal inclusions. The
  physiological impact of α‐synuclein on nuclear functions is unclear, whereas pathological
  α‐synuclein might be related to alterations in the transcription process. To what
  extent β‐synuclein and misfolded β‐synuclein affect neuronal organelles and nuclei
  is currently unknown. (B) α‐Synuclein interacts with several cytoskeletal components,
  among which the axonal microtubules are destabilized by misfolded and aggregated
  α‐synuclein. It is unknown whether β‐synuclein interacts with microtubules and other
  structural proteins. (C) The most relevant functions of α‐synuclein are exerted
  in presynaptic terminals and mainly deal with regulation of vesicular trafficking
  and homeostasis of neurotransmitters in both dopaminergic neurons and other cell
  types. Physiologically, α‐synuclein promotes storage of dopamine into presynaptic
  vesicles and its release through exocytosis. In synucleinopathies, the synthesis
  of dopamine might be overstimulated, resulting in dopamine‐induced neurotoxicity.
  β‐Synuclein may act as a synaptic chaperone and, hypothetically, its aggregation
  might be promoted by dopamine dyshomeostasis, thus contributing to neuronal damage.
