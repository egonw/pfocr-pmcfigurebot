caption: 'The regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis in the pathological progression
  of CHD. There are three major independent regulatory pathways of ferroptosis: the
  System Xc-GSH-GPX4 axis, the GCH1-BH4 pathway, and the FSP1-CoQ-NADPH pathway. In
  addition, iron metabolism and lipid peroxidation are the main mechanisms. Abbreviations:
  PUFAs: polyunsaturated fatty acids; PUFA-PE: polyunsaturated fatty acid-phosphatidyl
  ethanolamine; ACSL4: acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4; LPCAT3: lysophosphatidylcholine
  acyltransferase 3; LOX: lipoxygenase; SLC7A11: subunit solute carrier family 7 member
  11; SLC3A2: solute carrier family 3 member 2; Glu: glutamate; GSH: glutathione;
  GPX4: glutathione peroxidase 4; GTP: guanosine triphosphate; BH4: tetrahydrobiopterin;
  GCH1: guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase 1; FSP1: ferroptosis suppressor protein
  1; NCOA4: nuclear receptor coactivator 4; NADPH: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate; ROS: reactive oxygen species; FT: ferritin; LIP: labile iron pool; CoQ10:
  coenzyme Q10.'
