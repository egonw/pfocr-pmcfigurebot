caption: Global metabolic consequences of cysteine and cystine deprivation. (A) Volcano
  plot displaying the Log2(Fold Change, FC) vs Log(False Discovery Rate, FDR P value)
  for all the metabolites identified by LC/MS. Metabolites highlighted in green (upregulated
  upon cysteine/cystine deprivation) or red (downregulated) have Log2(FC) > 1 or < −1
  and an FDR P value < 0.05 (5 replicates per cell line and per condition). (B) Pathway
  analysis performed on the metabolites levels computed depicts the major pathways
  affected. (C) 13C incorporation from [U‐13C]‐glutamine into cellular glutamine pools,
  and (D) tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) metabolites displayed as the contribution
  of each isotopologue to the total metabolite pool. 13C‐tracing experiments are displayed
  as bar plots; mean ± SD, n = 3 (***P < 0.001, two‐tailed Student’s t‐test). (E)
  13C incorporation from [U‐13C]‐glutamine into uridine monophosphate (UMP) as the
  m+3 isotopologue (bar plots as mean ± SD, n = 3. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.005; ***P < 0.001,
  two‐sided Student’s t‐test). (F) Representative western blot of methyltetrahydrofolate
  dehydrogenase 1 (MTHFD1) as a marker of folate cycle activity. (G) Ratio of SAM
  and SAH for the 3 IDH1‐mutant glioma cell lines computed from the unlabeled global
  profiling experiment (n = 5, bar plots displaying mean values ± SD).
