caption: EBOV infection of iPSC-HLCs leads to a general downregulation of critical
  pathways with the exception of viral response pathwaysGene Ontology (GO) analysis
  of the DEGs in EBOV- compared with mock-infected BU3 iPSC-HLCs for each time point
  (n = 2 technical replicates per infection condition per time point). FDR ≤0.01.
  Time point labeled on the bottom of the plot, GO pathways labeled on the left of
  the plot, key located on the right of the plot. Red bubbles mark pathways that are
  upregulated at each time point, and blue bubbles denote pathways that are downregulated
  at each time point. The GO analysis by WebGestalt determined that all p values =
  0, indicating that the p value is <0.001 for each pathway.
