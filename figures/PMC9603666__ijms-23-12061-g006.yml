caption: CD44V3 increased the AKT signaling pathway. (A) The p-AKT and t-AKT levels
  in AsPC-1 cells transfected with CD44V3 shRNA were determined by Western blot. (B)
  The p-AKT and t-AKT levels in AsPC-1 cells transfected with U2AF1 shRNA were determined
  by Western blot. (C) Cell count assay of AsPC-1 cells transfected with CD44V3 shRNA
  and treated with or without recombinant EGF. (D) Transwell migration and invasion
  assay of the AsPC-1 cells transfected with CD44V3 shRNA and treated with or without
  recombinant EGF. (E) A graphical abstract of the role of CD44V3 in tumor progression.
  The data are presented as mean Â± S.D. ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001.
