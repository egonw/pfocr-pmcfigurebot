figure_title: Schematic diagram illustrating the important role of CK2α-GRP94-LRP6
  axis in TNBC metastasis
caption: In TNBC cells, elevated CK2α phosphorylates GRP94 at serine 306 residue,
  leading to increased stability of the GRP94 protein. As an ER chaperone, GRP94 promotes
  the maturation of LRP6 protein, resulting in activation of Wnt signaling. Collectively,
  the activation and upregulation of CK2α and GRP94 synergistically promote the metastasis
  of TNBC cells through the Wnt signaling pathway. By targeting CK2α-mediated phosphorylation
  of GRP94 with benzamidine, metastasis of TNBC can be effectively controlled as a
  therapeutic strategy.
