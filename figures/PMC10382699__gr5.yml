caption: 'Effects of microglia depletion in the CA1 LTP of male Tsc2+/− Ep mice. (A)
  Outline of poly(I:C) injections, treatment with PLX, and analysis approach. (B)
  Initial fEPSP slopes recorded in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices are shown
  before (baseline, 15 minutes) and following LTP induction (with a 1-second, 100-Hz
  tetanus delivered at time 0) for the tetanized pathway and for a separate, untetanized
  pathway (control). Data are plotted in 1-minute blocks and fEPSP slopes are normalized
  to the average baseline response. Sample traces show responses (5 responses were
  averaged) during baseline (gray) and during the last 5 minutes of recordings (color).
  Scale bars = 1 mV and 10 ms. (C) Averaged fEPSPs during the last 20 minutes of LTP
  recording. Regular two-way analysis of variance, pathway × genotype interaction:
  F2,54 = 10.51, p < .001; Sidak’s multiple comparisons for tetanized vs. control
  pathway fEPSPs, ∗∗∗∗p < .0001 for Tsc2+/−/VEH group, not significant for other two
  groups; Tukey’s multiple comparisons for tetanized pathway fEPSPs, ∗∗p < .01 for
  Tsc2+/−/PLX group vs. Tsc2+/−/VEH group. (D) Averaged PTP fEPSPs (5 minutes) recorded
  immediately after a 100-Hz tetanus. Regular two-way analysis of variance, pathway
  factor: F1,54 = 105.1, p < .001; genotype factor: F2,54 = 1.488, p > .05; Sidak’s
  multiple comparisons for tetanized vs. control pathway, ∗∗∗∗p < .0001 for all 3
  groups. Tsc2+/−/VEH slices, n = 10 from 6 mice. Tsc2+/−/PLX slices, n = 11 from
  7 mice. WT/PLX slices, n = 9 slices from 5 mice. All data are shown as mean ± SEM.
  fEPSP, field excitatory postsynaptic potential; L-LTP, late long-term potentiation;
  LTP, long-term potentiation; n.s., not significant; P, postnatal day; PLX, PLX5622;
  Poly I:C, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid; PTP, post-tetanus potentiation; Tsc2+/−
  Ep, Tsc2+/− with early postnatal immune activation; VEH, vehicle; WT, wild-type.'
