caption: 'Antagonizing estrogen receptors attenuates ISSP treatment of oxidative damage
  and ISSP''s activation of Nrf2 signaling pathway in EA.hy926 cells. (a) The western
  blot examined protein levels of estrogen receptors. (b) The expression level of
  estrogen receptors protein after preintervention with receptor-specific antagonists.
  (c) The cell viability assessment. (d) The level of LDH. (e) The level of ET-1.
  (f) The level of SOD and MDA. (g) The western blot examined protein levels. (h)
  The expression level of Nrf2 mRNA, HO-1 mRNA, and NQO1 mRNA. The data are denoted
  as mean ± SD (a, b, g and h, n = 3; c– f, n = 6). △P < 0.05 indicates a significant
  difference compared with the control group; On the other hand, compared with the
  Mod group, #P < 0.05 indicates that there is a statistically significant difference
  and ∗P < 0.05 indicates a significant difference compared with the ISSP group.'
