figure_title: p190RhoGAP mediates YAP/TAZ inhibition by SEMA3 and PLXNA
caption: '(A) A flow chart illustrating the TurboID-Mass Spectrometry that was used
  to identify proteins whose interactions with PlexinA are affected by rSEMA3A treatment.
  (B) A graph showing proteins that inherently or dynamic interacts with PlexinA1
  before and after SEMA3 treatment. Notably, many RhoGAPs (RHGs) interact with PlexinA1,
  but only p190RhoGAP-A (ARHGAP35, RHG35) increases its interaction with PlexinA1
  upon rSEMA3A treatment. (C) A coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous ARHGAP35 and PlexinA2
  using an ARHGAP35 antibody. The star (*) indicates PlexinA2, and # indicates ARHGAP35.
  IB, immunoblot; IP, immunoprecipitation; IgG, immunoglobulin G. (D) Deletion of
  ARHGAP5/35 in HEK293A cells blocks rSEMA3A-induced phosphorylation and (E) cytoplasmic
  translocation of YAP. Scale bars, 25 Î¼m.'
