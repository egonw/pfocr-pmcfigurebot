caption: 'Differential metabolic pathway analysis of model group and administration
  group. The relevant thresholds were set as follows: −log (P) > 1.0 and pathway impact
  value >0.2. The ordinate represents −log (P), and the darker the color, the higher
  the significance level. The horizontal axis represents the importance of metabolic
  pathways, and the larger the circle, the more important the pathway. Five metabolic
  pathways were interfered: phenylalanine metabolism; Biosynthesis of phenylalanine,
  tyrosine and tryptophan; Niacin and niacinamide metabolism; Glycerol phospholipid
  metabolism; Alanine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid metabolism.'
