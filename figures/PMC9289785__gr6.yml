caption: The morphogenetic domain signaling network model suggested that the Notch
  and the Ephrin signaling pathways cross-talk and play important roles in regulating
  tissue morphogenesis. (A) We identified the differentially expressed genesets in
  morphogenetic domains by clustering and correlative image analysis. Results of GO
  term analysis indicate that Wnt, Notch and Ephrin pathway components were enriched
  in these genesets. The three pathways, Wnt (blue), Notch (red) and Ephrin (dark
  blue) crosstalk with each other through intermediate hub genes (orange circle).
  (B) The Notch and the Ephrin signaling pathways were highly expressed during embryo
  early organogenesis. The components of the pathways showed regional specificity
  of gene expression in multiple morphogenetic domains. (N and E stand for Notch and
  Ephrin signaling pathway components, respectively in the circle shape markers. The
  white color indicates “detected” and black color indicates “not detected.”). (For
  interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred
  to the web version of this article.)
