caption: Utility of the dataset to determine possible pathway perturbances and binding
  targets.A, diagram of significantly enriched pathways observed within the endocrine
  islet. B, a diagram of known cysteine-binding proteins detected and the biological
  processes in which they participate within the islet that could be affected by cysteine-targeted
  drug treatment.
