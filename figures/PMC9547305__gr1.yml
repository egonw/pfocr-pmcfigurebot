caption: IGF2BP1 binds to 3′UTR of IQGAP3 in an m6A-dependent manner in NTERA-2 cells(A)
  Comparison of Igf2bp1 and Iqgap3 mRNA expression in mouse blastocyst and various
  adult mouse tissues. Statistical significance was determined by the one-way ANOVA
  method.(B) Motif enrichment in IGF2BP1 binding sites in RIP-seq.(C) GO pathway enrichment
  analysis of IGF2BP1 binding target genes identified by RIP-seq.(D) Distribution
  of IGF2BP1 binding sites across MYC and SRF as identified by RIP-seq in NTERA-2
  overexpressed with FLAG-IGF2BP1.(E) IGF2BP1 binding to IQGAP3 3’UTR as identified
  by RIP-seq.(F) RIP-qPCR validation using IGF2BP1 antibody.(G) RIP-qPCR using m6A
  antibody in NTERA-2 cells reveals the presence of m6A modification in IQGAP3, MYC,
  and SRF mRNAs.Data bars represent mean values with standard deviation (n=3). Data
  in (G and H) were statistically analyzed using two-tailed Student’s t-test (∗∗∗∗
  for P-value of <0.0001, ∗∗∗ for P-value of <0.001 and NS for not significant). See
