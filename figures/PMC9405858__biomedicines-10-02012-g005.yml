caption: PHA-767491 reduces E2F-mediated transcription in Rb+ positive cancer cell
  lines. (A) Cells were synchronised in M phase using thymidine and nocodazole block,
  released for 4 h and treated with inhibitors for 8 h that would capture G1 transition.
  Prostate carcinoma cell line PC3 was treated with 10 μM XL-413, 10 μM PHA-767491,
  10 μM CVT-313 or 30 μM Roscovitine as indicated. The mRNA levels of cyclins A2,
  E1 and E2 were monitored using qRT-PCR after 8 h of kinase inhibitor treatment.
  Bars show mean ± standard deviation, where n = 3. (B) As for A, using SW480 colorectal
  carcinoma cell line. (C) As for A, using colorectal carcinoma cell line SW620. (D)
  Western blot of PC3 cells treated with 10 μM XL-413, 10 μM PHA-767491, 30 μM roscovitine
  or 10 μM CVT-313 as indicated. The levels of DDK-mediated pMCM2-ser53, DDK and CDK-mediated
  phosphorylation of pMCM2-ser40/41, MCM2, cyclin E, Dbf4, cyclin A and actin are
  shown. (E) As for (D) using SW480 cell lines. (F) As for (D) using SW620 cell lines.
