caption: 'AKG therapy reduced nerve injury and brain cell death in MCAO mice. (a)
  Hematoxylin and eosin staining experiment (n = 7). Scale bar, 100 μm. (b) Nissl
  staining assay (n = 7). Scale bar, 100 μm. (c) TUNEL assay (n = 7) (TUNEL, green;
  DAPI, blue) (n = 7). Scale bar, 100 μm. (d and e) The number of Nissl-positive neurons
  and TUNEL-positive cells was calculated. (f and g) BAX and BCL-2 mRNA levels were
  determined by RT-qPCR (n = 5). ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 versus the sham group and
  #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01 versus the MCAO group.'
