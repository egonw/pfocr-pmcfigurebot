caption: 'Antagonism of type I and type II IFN signaling pathways by Paramyxoviridae.
  Once interferon is produced, it will be released by the cells and will bind in a
  paracrine and autocrine manner to the interferon membrane receptors (IFNAR1 and
  IFNAR2). The binding with interferon receptors leads to the phosphorylation of JAK1
  and TYK2. Subsequently, the activated Janus kinases activate and phosphorylate STAT2
  and STAT1. Phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 dimerize and bind to interferon regulatory
  factor 9 (IRF9) to form a complex STAT1-STAT2-IRF9 called IFN-stimulated gene factor
  3 (ISGF3). The ISGF3 translocates to the nucleus and binds to the DNA sequences
  called: IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) within a group of genes known as
  interferon-stimulated genes (ISG). This binding activates the transcriptions of
  more than 100 ISGs. All these genes establish an antiviral state that limits viral
  replication and dissemination. Type II IFN (IFN-γ) is produced by activated immune
  cells and leads to the production of a different subset of ISGs via a distinct signaling
  pathway. Type II IFN (IFNγ) binds to a different receptor complex also formed of
  two subunits: IFN-γR1 and IFN-γR2. Type II IFN signaling activates STAT1 by phosphorylation,
  which homodimerizes to form the interferon gamma factor (GAF), which translocates
  to the nucleus and binds to DNA at γ-activated sequence (GAS) elements within a
  different group of ISGs. Most of the paramyxoviruses are able to neutralize the
  type I and type II IFN signaling pathways by targeting most of the transcription
  factors involved. Most of V proteins from paramyxovirus are represented in red,
  interacting with type I and type II IFN signaling pathways transcription factors
  represented in light gray. LPMV V: La Piedad Michoacán Mexico Virus V protein, MPRV
