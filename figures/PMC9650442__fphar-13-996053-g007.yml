caption: 'Database analysis of stem and K-Ras gene expressions in colon cancer. (A)
  Chordal graph of the correlation between the expression of CD133 and inflammatory
  genes. The expression of CD133 was found to positively correlate with IL-7, IL-17A,
  IL-17RC, IL-22RA2, IL-22, and IL-23A. (B) Chordal graph of the correlation between
  the expression of Lgar5 and inflammatory genes. The expression of LGR5 was found
  to positively correlate with IL-11RA, IL-17RB, IL-17RD, IL-17D, IL-22RA1, IL-23R,
  and IL-23A, and negatively correlate with IL-17C, and IL-17REL. (C) Chordal graph
  of the correlation between the expression of K-Ras and inflammatory genes. The expression
  of K-Ras was found to positively correlate with RAF1, PIK3CA, PIK3C3, AKT3, and
  MAPK1, and negatively correlate with AKT1, AKT2, and IL-17RC. (D) K-Ras gene expression
  based on the TCGA database analysis in normal and colon cancer tissues (***: p <
  0.001). (E) GSEA analysis indicated significant correlations between K-Ras mRNA
  expression and stemness-related gene signatures. GSEA from the publicly available
  GEO database (Colon cancer) has shown positive correlation (p < 0.05) between K-Ras
  expression and stemness-related gene signatures.'
