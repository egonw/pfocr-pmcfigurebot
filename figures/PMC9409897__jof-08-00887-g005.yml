caption: The subnetwork of glycerolipid metabolism in C. militaris responsible for
  the fungal growths on different carbon sources (C5 vs. C6 cultures and C12 vs. C6
  cultures) using enhanced GSMM of C. militaris. The horizontal boxes under the metabolite
  name indicate the significant DAMs observed in this pathway, which are PA (17:0/14:1(9z))
  and TG (12:0/12:0/17:2(9z,12z)) [iso3] represented as phosphatidic acid and triacylglycerol,
  respectively. A list of DAMs and DEGs involved in the glycerolipid biosynthetic
  pathway is listed in . The asterisk (*) means the reference carbon source used for
  all possible pairwise comparisons.
