caption: 'PNS repressed the PKM2/STAT3 signaling pathway to attenuate inflammation
  in the CIA model. DBA/1J mice were immunized with bovine type II collagen emulsified
  in complete Freund adjuvant and incomplete Freund adjuvant. Mice were treated at
  day 21 after the first immunization with saline or PNS (100 mg/kg). (A) Nuclear
  and cytoplasmic fractions were isolated by cell fractionation from splenic CD4+T
  cells of CIA mice and analyzed for PKM2 expression by western blots. Histone H3
  and β-actin were used as nuclear and cytoplasm loading controls, respectively. (B)
  Splenic CD4+T cells from CIA mice were crosslinked with DSS and analyzed for dimeric/tetrameric
  PKM2 expression by western blots. β-Actin was used as a loading control. (C) Splenic
  CD4+T cell lysates from CIA mice were subjected to a western blot of total and phospho-STAT3
  (Y705) expression. β-Actin was used as a loading control. Data were expressed as
  the mean ± SEM (n = 6). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, compared with the control group,
  #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, compared with the model group, by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s
  post hoc test.'
