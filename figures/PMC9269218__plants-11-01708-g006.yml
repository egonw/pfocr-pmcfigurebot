caption: Comparison of DEGs induced by A. brassicicola identified by van Wees et al.
  []. Number of genes induced by A. brassicicola in rosette leave [], were compared
  with upregulated genes in germinating seeds and seedlings (at 3, 6 and 10 DAS respectively).
  The number of common DEGs to those identified by van Wees et al. [] are shown in
  the Venn diagram. (A) Comparison with genes induced by A. brassicicola; (B) Comparison
  with genes induced by A. brassicicola and related to the JA pathway.
