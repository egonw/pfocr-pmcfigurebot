caption: Cucurbitacin B down-regulated the expression of transfected TNF-R1. (A,B)
  A549 cells were transfected with a plasmid vector encoding FLAG-tagged human TNF-R1
  for 18 h. Transfected A549 cells were treated with or without cucurbitacin B at
  the indicated concentrations for 1 h, followed by the preparation of cytoplasmic
  fractions. Blots are representative of three independent experiments (A). The amount
  of TNF-R1-FLAG was normalized to that of GAPDH. TNF-R1-FLAG protein (%) is shown
  as mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments (B). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and
  *** p < 0.001.
