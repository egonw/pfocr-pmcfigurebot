caption: EVs derived from extrahepatic tissues regulate hepatic glucose homeostasis.
  Extrahepatic tissues can deliver their pathophysiological information to the liver
  in the form of EVs through systemic circulation. Pathophysiological statuses related
  to metabolic dysfunction, such as aging and obesity increase the amount of metabolic
  homeostasis-disrupting molecules in these EVs and transmit metabolic dysfunctions
  of the donor to the liver by targeting essential factors for regulating glucose
  homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. (A) Aged BM-MSCs target SIRT1 gene expression
  in hepatocytes by transferring miR-29b-3p loaded in EVs and aggravate insulin resistance.
  (B) Opposed to lean ATM, obese ATM send miR-155-containing EVs to hepatocytes through
  circulation and repress PPARG gene expression, which is related to insulin sensitivity.
  (C) Gut microbial EVs are eliminated from blood by phagocytic activity of CRIg+
  KCs in the liver. However, obesity reduces population of CRIg+ KCs and promotes
  the transport of microbial EVs containing pathogenic DNA to the liver by disrupting
  intestinal barrier integrity. It leads to aggravation of inflammation and insulin
  resistance in hepatocytes by activating cGAS/STING pathway. Schematic illustration
  was created with BioRender.com. BM-MSC, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell; ATM,
  adipose tissue macrophages; PPARG, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma;
  CRIg, complement receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily; KC, Kupffer cell; mDNA,
  gut microbial DNA; cGAS, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase; STING, stimulator of interferon
  genes; EV, extracellular vesicle.
