caption: Schematic of STAT3 signaling in tumor microenvironment (TME). STAT3 activation
  has the ability in affecting TME via up‐ or downregulating downstream molecules
  and promoting tumor cell proliferation and survival, angiogenesis, immune evasion
  as the result. The functions of natural killer cell and dendritic cell in antigen
  presentation and target cell recognition are inhibited. While macrophage polarization
  toward M2‐like endotype and the immune checkpoint expression and proliferation of
  myeloid‐derived suppressor cell, cancer‐associated fibroblasts, and regulatory T‐cell
  are promoted by phosphorylated STAT3
