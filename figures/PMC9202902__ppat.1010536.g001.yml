caption: 'Virions enter the cell via fusion with the host-cell membrane or endocytosis.
  The capsid docks at the nuclear pore and viral DNA enters the nucleus through the
  portal in the capsid (drawn in teal above). The HSV-1 genome is then expressed:
  (1) α genes are expressed upon entry; (2) α gene products drive β transcription;
  (3) after β protein expression, vDNA replication occurs; (4) γ1 gene expression
  is amplified, and γ2 gene expression is enabled by DNA replication; (5) capsid proteins,
  which are γ gene products, assemble; and then (6) replicated genomes are packaged
  into capsids through the portal. Packaged capsids leave the nucleus through nuclear
  egress and move through the secretory pathway, obtain an envelope spiked with viral
  glycoproteins, and nascent virions are released from the cell by exocytosis. Transcript
  and protein timing pictured above are approximated based on previous studies [,].
  Note that the viral genome forms concatemers during replication as indicated above,
  and unit length genomes (flanked by green) are packaged into capsids. Also note
  that some models indicate that the viral genome circularizes after entry into the
  nucleus. Tegument proteins were omitted for simplicity. Figure created using www.biorender.com.
