caption: Schematic illustration of Hippo-YAP/TAZ signaling pathway. A variety of cellular
  conditions in tissue such as cell density, extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness,
  or cell polarity can elicit signals regulating the Hippo signaling cascade. Receptors
  sensing the cellular conditions have yet to be identified. (A) When the Hippo signaling
  is turned on, sequential phosphorylation processes by kinase components of the pathway
  lead to phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ, resulting in cytoplasmic retention or degradation
  of the transcription factors. (B) When the Hippo signaling is turned off, unphosphorylated
  YAP/TAZ can translocate into the nucleus, where they interact with TEAD and transcriptionally
  activate numerous target genes. The Hippo–YAP/TAZ signaling pathway presented in
  the figure is tightly regulated in hepatocytes, the parenchymal cells in the liver.
