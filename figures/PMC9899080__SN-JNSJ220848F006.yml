caption: CIE disrupts the optically evoked depolarization to hyperpolarization balance
  in the vlPAG/DRDA-dBNST pathway. A, Schematic illustrating whole-cell patch clamp
  recordings in the presence of 3 mm kynurenic acid + 25 μm picrotoxin. Representative
  traces of depolarization (top; air traces in gray and CIE traces in orange) and
  hyperpolarization in response to optical stimulation train (20 pulses, 20 Hz; blue
  bar). B, CIE significantly altered the cellular responses of dBNST neurons in response
  to phasic stimulation of ChR2-expressing terminals. Compared with air mice, optical
  stimulation at 20 Hz resulted in a lower percentage of hyperpolarization in CIE-treated
  animals. C, D, Grouped data showing the peak amplitude of voltage responses from
  dBNST neurons. There were no statistical differences between groups in average amplitude
  of depolarization or hyperpolarization, though a trend toward increased amplitude
  in CIE mice. Intrinsic properties of cells that depolarized varied from cells that
  hyperpolarized. Specifically, neurons that depolarized had a higher membrane capacitance
  (E) and were more hyperpolarized at rest (G) compared with neurons that hyperpolarized.
  CIE did not affect membrane capacitance but altered the resting membrane potential.
  The hyperpolarized neurons in CIE mice rested at a more positive membrane potential
  than the air. F, Membrane resistance was not altered by either cellular response
  or CIE exposure. H, Correlation analysis showed a negative relationship between
  resting membrane potential and cellular response to optical stimulation. I, Representative
  traces of hyperpolarization in response to optical stimulation train (20 pulses,
  20 Hz; blue bar) at baseline (black trace) and following bath application of sulpiride
  (2 μm; dark red trace). J, D2 receptor antagonism blocked hyperpolarization. K–M,
  Representative traces of depolarization in response to optical stimulation train
  (20 pulses, 20 Hz; blue bar) at baseline (black trace) and in the presence of either
  SCH-23390 (2 μm; top blue trace) or amiloride (500 μm; bottom green trace). D1 receptor
  antagonists at two different concentrations (2 μm in blue circles, 10 μm in gray
  circles) failed to block the response (L). Amiloride (500 μm), an ASIC inhibitor,
  partially reduced the depolarization (M). Data expressed as mean ± SEM; $ represents
  the main effect of group. *p < 0.05.
