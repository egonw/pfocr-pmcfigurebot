caption: GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses of SSLF for RIF. (aâ€“c) The bubble
  graph shows biological process, cellular component, molecular function, and the
  intersection gene GO analysis. The left Y-axis is the name of the GO path, and the
  abscissa is p value. The larger the circle is, the greater the number of genes compared
  to this path. The darker the color is, the higher the proportion of genes compared
  to this path. (d) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis circle diagram. In the outermost
  layer of the circle, signaling pathway names are displayed in the right side and
  gene names are displayed in the left side. The inner ring on the left indicates
  the significant p value of gene corresponding pathway.
