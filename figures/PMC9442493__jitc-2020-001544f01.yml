caption: 'MemIL-18 constructs: design, expression and signaling. (A) Sketches of the
  membrane-anchored protein products. S, short and L, long linker. (B) Immunoblot
  analysis for the indicated protein products in lysates of K562 cells. Twenty-four hours
  post-transfection, cell lysates were subjected to PAGE analysis and probed by using
  rabbit anti-human IL-18 Ab and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ab. (C) Quantitative
  fluorescence imaging in CD8 T cells engineered by memIL-18 mRNA electroporation.
  Images were acquired using the WiScan Hermes High-Content Imaging System using an
  X60 objective and quantification was performed with the WiSoft Athena software protein
  expression application. Graph summarizes mean intensity ±SEM of at least a thousand
  cells in 137 images. Nuclei (blue). Scale bar: 12.5 µm. Indicated significance was
  determined by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test; (***p≤0.001).
  (D) Representative flow cytometry data for the surface expression of memIL-18 in
  TIL14, 24 hours post-mRNA transfection. The experiment was repeated twice. (E) Upregulation
  of T-bet in mRNA-transfected CD8+ T cells of a healthy donor. Cells were transfected
  with the indicated mRNAs and stained for cell surface IL-18 and for intracellular
  T-bet, using a PE-conjugated anti-human T-bet mAb. The experiment was repeated twice.
  (F) Reporter assay for activation of the NF-κB pathway in HEK293T cells. Cells were
  transiently transfected with the NF-κB-Luciferase reporter plasmid. Twenty-four hours
  later, cells were transfected with 10 µg of the indicated mRNAs and after 24 hours
  luciferase activity in cell lysates was monitored. caTLR4 and caCD40, constitutively
  active TLR4 and CD40, respectively. All experimental data show mean values±SEM from
  four independent experiments. Indicated significance was determined by one-way ANOVA
  with Tukey’s multiple comparison test; (**p≤0.01; ***p≤0.001). (G) The two memIL-18
  products engage IL-18R both in cis and in trans. CD8+ T cells were electroporated
  with mRNA encoding the two memIL-18 products or GFP. Six hours post-transfection,
  coculture was performed at a 1:1 GFP/CD8+:memIL-18/CD8+ cell ratio. Fourteen hours
  later, cells were stained for cell surface IL-18 and for intracellular T-bet as
  described above. (H) CD8+ T cells were transfected with the indicated mRNAs, with
  or without the anti-melanotransferrin CAR mRNA, and cocultured at a 1:1 ratio with
  579 melanoma cells for 24 hours. Growth medium was then collected and analyzed for
  the presence of IL-18 by MAGPIX Luminex. Graph bars present the mean cytokine concentration
  (pg/mL)±SEM (triplicate) from three healthy donors (n=3). (I) TIL14 and TIL86 were
  transfected with the indicated mRNAs, cultured in the presence or absence of the
  624 melanoma cells at a 1:2 E:T ratio for 24 hours and growth medium was similarly
  analyzed for IL-18. Some error bars obtained with MAGPIX are too small to be visible.
