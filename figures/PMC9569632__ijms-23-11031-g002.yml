caption: Influence of PD-L1 on colony formation and cell cycle progression in NSCLC
  cells. Overexpression of (a) PD-L1 mRNA and (b) PD-L1 protein in H2170 and H1299
  cells after stable transfection, determined by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting
  (WB), respectively. β-actin was used as a loading control for WB. PD-L1-3 (3), PD-L1-6
  (6), and PD-L1-7 (7) are positive clones from H2170; PD-L1-16 (16), PD-L1-17 (17),
  and PD-L1-22 (22) are positive clones from H1299. Control cells were transfected
  with an empty vector. (c) PD-L1 overexpression increased H2170 and H1299 proliferation,
  as revealed by colony formation assay. Representative images of colony formation
  (ci; magnification 50 ×) and quantification of the number of colonies (cii). (d)
  Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry showing that ectopic PD-L1 expression resulted
  in a significantly increased H2170 cell population in S and G2/M phases and increased
  H1299 cell numbers in the G2/M phase. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 when
  analyzed using Student’s t-test.
