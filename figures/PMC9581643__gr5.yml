caption: SADS-CoV infection inhibits the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway to induce autophagy(A)
  Vero E6 cells were infected with SADS-CoV at an MOI of 0.1. Cell samples were collected
  at various time points and subjected to immunoblot with indicated antibodies.(B)
  The normalized ratios of p-Akt/Akt and p-mTOR/mTOR, respectively, were quantified
  and plotted.(C and E) Vero E6 cells were mock infected or infected with SADS-CoV
  (MOI = 0.1) and then treated with MK2206 or Neferine at 1.5 hpi. Cell samples were
  collected at 24 hpi. The effect of the regulators on the level of Akt and mTOR activities
  and the replication of SADS-CoV were measured with indicated antibodies.(D and F)
  The normalized ratios of N/GAPDH, p-Akt/Akt, and p-mTOR/mTOR under different conditions
  were quantified and plotted. (G) Vero E6 cells were prepared as described in the
  legend of C and 5E. Confocal microscopy was performed to examine the effect of MK2206
  or Neferine on autophagy activity and viral replication. Scale bar, 10 μm.(H) The
  viral titer of the culture supernatant was determined by TCID50.(I) Vero E6 cells
  were transfected with siAkt or siNC and were harvested for Western blot analysis
  at 48 hpi. Knockdown efficiency was tested by the relative expression of Akt to
  GAPDH.(J) Vero E6 cells treated with the indicated siRNAs were infected with SADS-CoV
  at an MOI of 0.1 after 24 h transfection. Then the cells were harvested at 24 hpi
  and subjected to Western blot analysis.(K) The normalized ratios of SADS-CoV-N/GAPDH
  in different transfected cells.(L) The viral titer of the culture supernatant was
  determined by TCID50. The data presented are means ± SD from at least three independent
  experiments. ns, non-significant.
