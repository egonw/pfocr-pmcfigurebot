figure_title: Intracellular and paracrine IFN-I signalling in MIRAS fibroblasts exposed
  to viral PAMP mimetics
caption: '(a) Inflammatory cytokine gene induction by viral PAMP mimetics (dsRNA/poly(I:C)
  or dsDNA) in fibroblasts. qPCR of cDNA, reference gene ACTB. N = 6 female controls
  and patients. (b) IFN-I signalling pathway proteins; fibroblasts exposed to viral
  PAMP mimetics (dsRNA/poly(I:C) or dsDNA). Western blot of two controls and patients
  in addition to the two controls and patients shown in Fig. . Quantification of 24 h
  treatment protein level relative to basal condition of each cell line (n = 4 female
  controls and patients), loading control HSP60. (c) IFN-I signalling pathway proteins
  in fibroblasts at 24 h post dsRNA/poly(I:C) or dsDNA treatment. Western blot, quantification,
  loading control HSP60. N = 6 female controls and patients. (d) Experimental setup;
  transfer of cell culture media from 24 h dsRNA/poly(I:C)-treated control or patient
  cells to naïve cells for another 24 h incubation to investigate paracrine immune
  signalling. (e) Paracrine immune signalling of fibroblasts as illustrated in d.
  Quantification of western blot, loading control HSP60. N = 4 female controls and
  patients. Refers to representative western blot in Fig. . In a, b, c and e, box
  plots show minimum-25th-50th(median)-75th percentile-maximum (whiskers extend to
  the smallest and largest value); two-tailed unpaired student’s t-test in a, b and
  c, 2-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test in e. Abbreviations: C, control;
  Pt, patient; IFN, interferon; PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern.'
