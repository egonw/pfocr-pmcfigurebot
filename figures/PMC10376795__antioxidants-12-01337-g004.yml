caption: 'Schematic of the regulatory network showing the validated targets of redoximiRs
  (miRTarBAse and TaRbase) among differentially expressed genes, protein–protein interactions
  (STRING), and correlations in the expression of the genes of the microRNA biogenesis
  pathway. Experimentally validated redoximiRs targets obtained from the miRTarBase
  and TaRbase databases are shown: redoximiRs regulated under conditions of hypoxia
  (red), H2O2 (light blue) and other conditions (light green). Edges represent protein–protein
  associations: known interactions from curated databases (light blue) and experimentally
  determined (pink) and co-expression (black). Arrows represent positive (dark purple)
  or negative (light purple) correlations between mRNA expressions.'
