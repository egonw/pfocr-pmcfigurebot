caption: The nicotinamide metabolic pathway was in an abnormal activation state in
  OSCC tumor tissues. (a) Heatmap shows differential metabolites in tumor and adjacent
  normal tissues of OSCC, n = 40. (b) Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT)-mediated
  methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to nicotinamide (NAM), forming
  1-methylnicoti-namide (MNA) and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH). (c–e) The relative
  metabolic levels of NAM, SAM and SAH in tumors and normal tissues of OSCC patients,
  respectively, n = 40. **** represents that differences were considered statistically
  significant with p < 0.0001.
