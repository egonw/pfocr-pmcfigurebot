figure_title: The p38α-BLIMP1 axis controls PC generation differentiated from in vivo
  generated GCB cells
caption: a Sort GCB cells (CD3−B220+Fas+GL7+) from the spleen of OVA/Alum/LPS immunized
  mice (n = 10 per group) at day 7.5 were mixed and cultured on IL-21 feeder cells,
  and iPCs differentiated from p38α KO and WT GCB cells were analyzed at day 4. b
  Sorted p38α KO GCB cells from the spleen of OVA/Alum/LPS immunized mice (n = 10
  per group) were mixed and cultured on IL-21 feeder cells and transduced with retroviruses
  encoding p38α or p38α kinase-dead mutants (K53M or T180A/Y182F) 1 day later. The
  percentage of iPCs in retrovirus-transduced B cells (CD19+GFP+CD138+) was analyzed
  by flow cytometry 3 days after transduction. c Flow cytometry analysis of iPCs among
  cultured p38α KO GCB cells from the spleen of OVA/Alum/LPS immunized mice (n = 10
  per group) transduced with retroviruses encoding p38α, BLIMP1, TCF3 (E12 or E47),
  TCF4, or IRF4 (CD19+GFP+CD138+). Data were representative of at least three independent
  experiments. Each symbol represents a representative sample. Small horizontal lines
  indicate the mean (±s.d.). Data were analyzed by two-tailed unpaired t-tests. Source
  data are provided as a Source Data file.
