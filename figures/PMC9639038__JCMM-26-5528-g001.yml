caption: 'Histone H3 was released in RAW264.7 cells stimulated by LPS and extracellular
  histone H3 induced ferroptosis in RAW264.7 cells. (A, B) The expression of H3 in
  RAW264.7 cells observed by confocal microscopy. (C) H3 level in the cell supernatant
  detected by ELISA. (D‐E) Western blotting for GPX4 in RAW264.7 cells. (F) The mRNA
  level of GPX4 in RAW264.7 cells measured by Quantitative real‐time PCR. (G–J) GSH,
  ROS and Fe2+ levels in RAW264.7 cells detected by kits. The cell experiment of Western
  blotting was repeated 3 times and other experiments were repeated 6 times. Compared
  with the normal group, #p < 0.05.'
