figure_title: PRDM15 regulates NHEJ repair by interacting with Ku70/80
caption: A Ku70, Ku80, and DNA-PKcs were immunoprecipitated by PRDM15 in lysates of
  irradiated HCT116 cells. B PRDM15 was immunoprecipitated by DNA-PKcs in lysates
  of irradiated HCT116 cells. C The representative IF images and quantification of
  co-localization of PRDM15 with DNA-PKcs. HCT116 cells at 0.5 h after IR were used
  for immunofluorescence staining. Confocal microscopy was applied to capture co-localization,
  and Image J was used to analyze the statistical significance of co-localization.
  Rr represents Pearson’s correlation coefficient and R represents Overlap coefficient.
  Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.5-1 is considered as co-localization. D–I Bioinformatics
  analysis of the correlation between PRDM15 and genes related to NHEJ pathway.
