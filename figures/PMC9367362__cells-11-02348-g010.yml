caption: 'Differential expression of specific genes involved in the cytokine pathway
  compared to NSCTR mice: (A–L) Top differentially expressed genes for the cytokine
  gene set displayed as bar graphs of individual genes as a function of time post-surgery.
  For each time point, gene expression levels are compared to the NSCTR mice. (M–O)
  bar graph for TGF signaling pathways, which may be important for wound healing deemed
  important in the cytokine pathway. Error bars indicate the standard error of the
  mean between NSCTR and each time point. Asterisks indicate that Padj < 0.05.'
