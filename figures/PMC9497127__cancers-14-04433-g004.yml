caption: Heatmaps showing the most enriched pathways detected in TCGA−LUAD (A) and
  TCGA−LUSC (B) after the HERV−specific pathway analysis performed by MITHrIL. In
  more detail, the value reported in the heatmap are the corrected accumulators generated
  by MITHrIL when it computed the perturbation scores, and both columns (pathways)
  and rows (differentially expressed HERVs) were clustered using the Spearman correlation
  distance.
