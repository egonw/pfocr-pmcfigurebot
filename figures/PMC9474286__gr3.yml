caption: Evaluation of cell disruption methods. (A) Perchloric acid (HClO4), hot water
  (H2O), cold methanol (MeOH), and potassium hydroxide (KOH) cell disruption methods
  were applied to (B) an artificial metabolite mix (containing metabolites 1–4, 6–8,
  10–12, 14–20, ∼18 mg L−1 each, ) as well as (C) to cell pellets of a strain producing
  either coniferyl alcohol or secoisolariciresinol. (B) Relative loss of metabolite
  concentration in metabolite mix after treatment with various cell disruption procedures.
  (C) Determined intracellular metabolite concentrations after cell disruption with
  various methods. The intracellular concentration of metabolites 1–4, 6–8, and 10–12
  was determined for cell pellets of AK_RgTAL. Cell pellets of ER_CueO were used to
  assess the intracellular concentration of metabolites 14–20. The numbering of metabolites
  corresponds to .
