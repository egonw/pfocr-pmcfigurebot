caption: Transcriptomic analyses suggested that aerobic exercise ameliorated hepatic
  inflammation, lipid abnormity and fibrosis in NASH mice. (A) Volcano map of differentially
  expressed genes in the transcriptomic analyses. (B) Heatmap in the transcriptomic
  analyses comparing NASH mice with NASH+Exercise mice. (C) GO enrichment analyses
  of those crucial down regulated genes in NASH+Exercise mice compared with NASH mice.
  The significance of enrichment was expressed by the log10 value of Benjamini adjusted
  P value together with the color transition from white to red. The gene number was
  for the number of enriched genes in certain functional pathway, while the percentage
  was for the proportion of enriched genes among total genes in certain functional
  pathway. (D) GO enrichment analyses of those crucial up regulated genes in NASH
  mice compared with controls. (E) GO enrichment analyses of those crucial down regulated
  genes in NASH mice compared with controls. (F) GO enrichment analyses of those crucial
  up regulated genes in NASH+Exercise mice compared with NASH mice.
