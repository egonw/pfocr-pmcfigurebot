caption: 'Kub3 gene knockout in mice results in perinatal or neonatal lethality. (A)
  Tissue distribution of Kub3 expression in adult mice examined by Western blot (WB).
  Total protein lysates were isolated from different organs of adult mice. Western
  blot was performed with antibodies against Kub3. GAPDH is the internal control.
  The ratios of Kub3 to GAPDH expression are represented by the graphs (n = 3). (B)
  Schematic diagram depicting the deletion of exons 2-5 from the wild-type Kub3 gene
  and creating Kub3 knockout mice. Red squares represent the exons of Kub3 and blue
  arrows indicate the sites of the primers for genotype identification. (C) Quantitative
  RT-PCR analysis of Kub3 mRNA levels in E18.5 embryos. GAPDH was used as an internal
  control for normalization (n = 3). (D) WB analysis of Kub3 protein level in E18.5
  embryos. Total protein lysates were isolated from embryos of WT, HT and KO at E18.5.
  GAPDH was used as a loading control. (E) In situ hybridization (ISH) analysis of
  Kub3 in WT and KO lungs at E18.5. Kub3-positive signals are shown as red fluorescence
  in cells. Nuclei were stained blue with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Scale
  bar: 20 µm.'
